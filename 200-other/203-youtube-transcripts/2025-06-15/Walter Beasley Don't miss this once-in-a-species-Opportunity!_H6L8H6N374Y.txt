[00:00] this is not only a once in A- lifetime
[00:01] opportunity but it's a Once in a once in
[00:03] a universe opportunity Bitcoin values my
[00:05] time you put the check in the bank and
[00:07] immediately your money starts to go down
[00:09] every person from an underserved
[00:11] Community should understand how powerful
[00:13] Bitcoin is and it changes the whole
[00:15] nature of the race thing I signed up for
[00:17] a loan with what I had in Bitcoin didn't
[00:20] ask any questions about my race didn't
[00:22] ask me questions about anything it just
[00:24] said okay well how much Bitcoin do you
[00:25] have well we feel comfortable loaning
[00:27] you this against your Bitcoin at 3%
[00:30] unnecessary Wars done now I have the
[00:32] options to do exactly what I want to do
[00:34] because Bitcoin is going to do what it's
[00:35] going to do I can take out my money
[00:37] anytime I want to in whatever spot I
[00:39] need to because it is mine and that
[00:41] enables me to make better decisions with
[00:43] my life to be your own bank and to be a
[00:45] person of color is an incredible
[00:51] opportunity the thing that I want to
[00:53] first talk with you about is financial
[00:55] inclusion
[00:57] because this is a topic that I don't
[01:00] talk so much about on on my
[01:02] podcast is like Bitcoin does not
[01:06] discriminate anyone like Bitcoin is just
[01:08] like it's software you can download it
[01:10] you you you can use it h and it doesn't
[01:13] care who you are but the Fe currencies
[01:16] cares who you are like if you go to the
[01:17] bank like it asks all these questions uh
[01:21] it asks where are you from who are your
[01:23] parents what is your what is your income
[01:26] all those weird questions that nobody
[01:28] should care about the banking system
[01:30] cares about um maybe let's uh start with
[01:34] your your experience in the in the Fiat
[01:36] world and how this Bitcoin got you
[01:38] better and maybe also with your loan
[01:40] story okay um well that's actually a
[01:43] great question in
[01:45] 200 and 20 my mother was diagnosed with
[01:48] uh uh Advanced cancer and I had already
[01:51] been we we'll go back to how I found
[01:53] Bitcoin I guess in a while but I'd
[01:55] already found Bitcoin and um I I had
[01:58] some and I think had run up to about
[02:00] 20,000 at that time so at that time you
[02:03] can get uh the infrastructure well well
[02:06] it really wasn't but it was there to get
[02:07] you know to get loans at two three 4%
[02:09] interest and I didn't know it so I
[02:11] didn't want to sell off any assets and I
[02:12] didn't want to do anything crazy so I
[02:14] just okay but I wanted to get my mother
[02:16] pet scan because I needed to see how
[02:18] advanced the cancer was and what we'd
[02:19] have to spend so on so forth and I did
[02:21] have Bitcoin so um I went to the bank
[02:24] and you know I I've sold over a million
[02:26] units I've done very well but I'm in a
[02:28] very conservative town in Arizona so I
[02:31] go into the bank and they kind of you
[02:32] know I get the look and I'm like but I'm
[02:34] dressed up and I'm talking we're talking
[02:36] and finally say okay you're approved for
[02:37] this amount of money that's okay at this
[02:39] interest that's okay but then they
[02:41] kicked it up of course to the writer who
[02:43] looked at my royalties looked at
[02:44] probably my Facebook page and you know
[02:46] all that kind of stuff I said H well Mr
[02:48] Beasley we've determined that you're not
[02:50] you you know it's kind of risky you know
[02:51] your assets and kind of risky your
[02:53] royalty game I said okay I've been
[02:55] through this before so I we'll give you
[02:57] the money but we're going to give you it
[02:59] has to be a high rate you know how they
[03:00] do just high high rate I said okay I've
[03:02] done this before and I knew what this is
[03:04] at the same time I had learned that I
[03:06] could take um I had learned that
[03:08] basically Bitcoin was a house was was an
[03:10] not only an asset but it was like you
[03:12] know something I could borrow against
[03:14] and somebody I learned it one the shows
[03:16] so I I I I typed it in I said okay and I
[03:19] told the bank I said okay I'll come back
[03:21] in a couple of days in the interim I
[03:23] signed up for a loan with what I had in
[03:26] Bitcoin didn't ask any questions about
[03:29] my race didn't ask me questions about
[03:31] anything as to your point it just said
[03:33] okay well how much Bitcoin do you have
[03:35] well we feel comfortable loaning you
[03:37] this against your Bitcoin at 3% interest
[03:40] I'm like
[03:42] what so I was able to do that and maybe
[03:45] maybe a day not even a day in in a day
[03:49] and I was able to take that go and and
[03:51] put my mother at the front of the list
[03:53] for a pet scan um because you know cash
[03:55] is King when it comes to stuff like that
[03:57] so I was able to do that we were able to
[03:59] determine that the cancer was far along
[04:01] but still to know that I could borrow
[04:03] against it was like a property it is a
[04:04] property really a pristine property and
[04:07] once I figured that out I was like you
[04:09] know every person from an underserved
[04:12] Community should understand how powerful
[04:15] Bitcoin is and it changes the whole
[04:17] nature of the race thing you know you to
[04:19] be your own bank and to be a person of
[04:22] color is an incredible opportunity and I
[04:25] don't think many of us are really
[04:26] considering that at this time to be able
[04:28] to to to not have to to go to a bank and
[04:30] experience what I experienced and I'm
[04:31] talking about somebody who you know I
[04:33] sold a lot of records and I've done
[04:34] pretty well and they still had me go
[04:37] through these steps and jump through
[04:38] these hers that were unnecessary where
[04:40] Bitcoin is just a great equalizer you
[04:42] know if you have some it's going to be
[04:45] it's it's okay you know it doesn't ask
[04:46] you anything about anything like you
[04:47] said where you're from your nation your
[04:49] nationality your ethnicity it's just
[04:51] property and it and just functions that
[04:53] way so I'm grateful for that and that's
[04:55] that's an aspect that I really want to
[04:57] highlight again it's like
[05:00] for for any Community or for any person
[05:04] that is like oh like the the financial
[05:06] system is not treating me uh well or
[05:09] it's like I'm in a bad position you have
[05:12] now a chance with Bitcoin that's why I
[05:14] have people from Africa on a lot I have
[05:16] people on from El Salvador a lot um it's
[05:19] it's it's the chance to be empowered
[05:21] with Bitcoin because all of the sudden
[05:24] there's this thing which is the best
[05:26] asset ever and it doesn't judge you yeah
[05:29] it's just there for you yes I think I
[05:32] was on your show that I I I I heard
[05:34] somebody was from Africa and like
[05:36] overnight everything went up 60% I'm was
[05:39] like what you know and you think think
[05:41] about you know if you have Bitcoin then
[05:43] you could okay well okay but what if you
[05:46] don't you know what if you know if all
[05:48] of a sudden you wake up that that next
[05:50] morning and everything you know is up
[05:52] 60% and you and you and and and your and
[05:55] the value of whatever your local
[05:56] currency is you know just gets you know
[05:58] gutted I'm like man what this then
[06:01] Bitcoin fixes all of that and I was so
[06:04] that's why especially to musicians of
[06:06] color and actually just music per I talk
[06:09] about this all the time I've actually
[06:10] been able to to to not coach but to um
[06:14] talk to some musician friends who
[06:16] actually studied ber College of Music
[06:17] who work in colleges and a couple of
[06:19] them actually put now they're putting uh
[06:22] instead of going to the 401 k 43b
[06:24] they're putting half of that into
[06:26] Bitcoin and and and taking you know and
[06:29] doing that for retirement and they're
[06:30] very very very happy with uh with the
[06:33] results it's been maybe you know six
[06:35] seven years so you know with an asset
[06:37] that gives you I just told you off
[06:39] camera that for the first time in my
[06:41] life you know I'm a pretty good musician
[06:42] and I've and and when you what you put
[06:45] into music music gives you back tfold
[06:47] you know it just really really it's
[06:49] amazing I had never found anything that
[06:51] did that except for Bitcoin now I've got
[06:53] something I can invest in it's going to
[06:55] give me back more than what I put in
[06:57] that's amazing for yeah that's that's
[07:00] the thing right if if you do something
[07:02] good uh if you put uh somewhere value in
[07:06] where you got more value out basically
[07:08] if you're a musician or something like
[07:09] that uh that's amazing but if you put
[07:13] that Financial energy that you got back
[07:15] into something bad in a weak asset then
[07:18] it it goes away again like you don't
[07:20] have anything from that yes and you know
[07:22] for me it's time you know I'm 63 so I
[07:25] spent you know I love writing I have a
[07:26] keyboard in front of me you can't see
[07:27] well actually maybe you can't a keyboard
[07:29] in front so I I I tour a lot I'm in a
[07:31] hotel now actually not you know my time
[07:33] is valuable I love doing music and so on
[07:35] so forth now I can you know I think
[07:38] about the fact that you know it's just
[07:40] it's just it Bitcoin values my time you
[07:43] know so and that's the thing I I it's
[07:46] just very very cool for me because now I
[07:47] don't worry about um you know the retire
[07:50] when I give up music in retirement
[07:51] because I've done you know the algorithm
[07:52] takes over and big if you do the
[07:54] four-year thing the foure thing the
[07:56] foure thing by the time I'm whatever I'm
[07:58] going to be when I get rid of this
[08:00] Bitcoin has already said I'll take care
[08:02] of you so that's what I like I love
[08:03] about Bitcoin actually yeah that's this
[08:06] great that's this great meme like take
[08:08] care of your Bitcoin now they will take
[08:10] care of you at some point and that
[08:12] that's that's a that's a really good
[08:15] thing like you have to take proper self-
[08:17] custody don't don't put them into
[08:19] something weird like uh like Celsius FDX
[08:24] there are so many cases where you lost
[08:26] your Bitcoin along the way hey I I got
[08:28] caught up in that not that but um I did
[08:31] I borrowed against it twice I didn't
[08:33] need to borrow against it the second
[08:34] time I said let me do it again and I got
[08:37] caught up in the uh can I say it on air
[08:38] or no don't say it on air yeah yeah I
[08:41] got caught up in the Celsius thing and
[08:44] um oh man I think you know it just and
[08:46] what's interesting is that what I tell
[08:48] people now excuse the siren um that I
[08:51] got caught up and I lost you know some
[08:54] stuff in Bitcoin but I we were still so
[08:55] early and we're early now but I was so
[08:58] early that I could put what I had you
[09:00] know keep putting in the Bitcoin and now
[09:02] pretty much I'm right where I was a
[09:04] little bit ahead of the game when I lost
[09:06] all I had lost you know the Celsius
[09:08] debacle That's What I Love About bit
[09:10] Bitcoin too we're so early in the game
[09:12] you know now we have the ETFs coming in
[09:14] we have and and I think that at this
[09:15] point too you got a whole lot more
[09:17] people holding on to that Bitcoin I know
[09:19] I'm one you know I'm just I'm not
[09:20] selling anything I'm not doing anything
[09:23] with my Bitcoin I'm just going to well
[09:25] I'm just going to set it and forget it
[09:27] you know so and that's that's the
[09:28] important thing for me is to know that I
[09:30] can relax do my thing value my time
[09:33] because Bitcoin
[09:35] values is that price um which maybe like
[09:39] let's not not as's a bull run coming uh
[09:42] and maybe the price gets really high is
[09:45] that price where you're like ah let's
[09:46] let's take half of them off or let's
[09:49] let's take some percent off and and do
[09:52] something with it I don't know pay for a
[09:53] house pay for kids or pay for anything I
[09:56] was thinking about that actually this
[09:58] morning
[10:00] and um I'm sure that there might be but
[10:02] may maybe 5% maybe 10% just something
[10:06] that would allow me to okay look you
[10:08] know maybe but I'm not even sure I want
[10:10] to do that because I don't need to you
[10:12] know um in in other words I'm still
[10:14] working in my 60s I'm touring and stuff
[10:16] like that so the cash element is fine
[10:18] but I really I want I wanted I really
[10:21] want to set me up and really be
[10:22] comfortable once I start say I'm done I
[10:24] don't want to do any of this and that's
[10:26] the thing that was interesting because
[10:27] when I was in school when I was teaching
[10:29] at at an institution Berkeley College of
[10:30] Music I I quit early in my early 50s and
[10:35] one day I went to the grocery store and
[10:36] I I bought some eggs and I said wait a
[10:38] minute these eggs are $2 more than they
[10:40] were last year and I'm like and then I
[10:43] started thinking globally I'm like
[10:44] what's going to happen like to the rest
[10:45] of this stuff it's going to go up my my
[10:47] income now is down I need something to
[10:50] really you know shoot up you know my
[10:52] savings and stuff and I've got nothing
[10:54] because and I hate the stock markets you
[10:56] got to play it up you got to play it
[10:57] down and this this I I hate people who
[10:59] run companies because I have no access
[11:02] to those people not hate but I don't
[11:04] like those companies because I have no
[11:05] access to the bosses I have no access I
[11:07] don't influence anything as relates to
[11:08] people who own stuff and all that kind
[11:10] of stuff what I love about Bitcoin is
[11:12] there's no ownership Bitcoin is Bitcoin
[11:14] there's no boss there's no you know a
[11:16] country doesn't own it so on so forth
[11:18] and when I saw that you know that it was
[11:21] a hedge against inflation like no other
[11:22] I was like I finally found something
[11:25] that I can say okay this will help me
[11:27] this will help you know my parents
[11:28] because my parents were you know I had
[11:29] to take care of them and I wanted to
[11:31] help their savings and and stretch them
[11:33] out and that's exactly what I did I used
[11:35] Bitcoin to do all of that and I
[11:36] encourage anybody you know just research
[11:38] it yourself but at the same time when
[11:40] you think about the fact that you've
[11:41] worked all these years you know um your
[11:45] savings you know to to save this amount
[11:47] of money and and if you put one to 5%
[11:50] 10% whatever it is you feel like it's a
[11:51] great allocation you're going to really
[11:53] supercharge everything that you sa for
[11:56] your whole life and that's what I that's
[11:58] what I that's what I'm doing and that's
[11:59] what I you know encourage other people
[12:01] to do investigate yourself and just
[12:02] figure it out but this this is not only
[12:04] once in A- lifetime opportunity but it's
[12:06] a Once in
[12:07] a once in a universe opportunity as far
[12:10] as I'm
[12:11] concerned once in a universe uh I I
[12:14] heard the the best thing I heard till
[12:16] now was once in a species
[12:19] opportunity I would agree with that
[12:22] yeah um do you also because uh how old
[12:25] are you 60 or what you said I'm 63 63
[12:29] yeah uh you you don't look like 6 Fe
[12:31] first of all well thank you man I
[12:33] appreciate that um but but as as someone
[12:37] 63 you you probably think a lot about
[12:40] retirement uh or do you just play till
[12:44] then or you just like want because you
[12:46] found something that you love so much
[12:47] you don't think about retirement or how
[12:49] do you view that with Bitcoin also well
[12:51] the savings component allows me to have
[12:53] options you know at first I was like
[12:55] okay well this is what I had it all
[12:57] planned out you know because the time
[12:58] was the most important things we talked
[13:00] about before for me what my time now
[13:02] with Bitcoin if I do the fouryear Cycles
[13:05] I can Factor okay well if I want to do
[13:07] this I want to do that for the next four
[13:08] years you know I catch the next bare
[13:10] Market or whatever and then by the time
[13:12] that place itself fed around the time
[13:14] I'm uh 70 7172 I'll be tired of this
[13:17] whole thing and I could just leave it
[13:19] alone so that's what I'm looking at but
[13:21] I have options and before when I left
[13:23] Berkeley when I left the the college and
[13:25] I had to take care of my parents
[13:26] financially I didn't I didn't have the I
[13:29] knew that I had to do X Y and Z because
[13:31] of inflation because this and that but
[13:33] now that you know when I found Bitcoin I
[13:35] was like now I have the options to do
[13:36] exactly what I want to do because
[13:38] Bitcoin is going to do what it's going
[13:39] to do you know what I mean so it's just
[13:42] I can create create create and like I
[13:44] said before something is going to give
[13:46] me back more than I put into it just
[13:48] like I'm doing with music amazing and
[13:51] you you uh we didn't we didn't even
[13:55] really introduce you Bitcoin
[13:59] I me just directly jump into the Bitcoin
[14:02] conversation um you you a musician you
[14:04] sold some covers I sold a million yeah
[14:07] yeah how did this come together and what
[14:10] are you doing exactly well I'm I was
[14:13] teaching actually I'm a tour and I've
[14:15] sold over a million units I'm a smooth
[14:17] jazz SC jazz musician and I've done very
[14:19] pretty pretty well doing that and I just
[14:22] I decided um in my 50s that I didn't
[14:24] want to teach anymore um I had done
[14:27] everything that I wanted to do in that
[14:28] Institution
[14:29] and I just wanted to walk away my house
[14:31] was paid for houses were paid for I had
[14:33] some property and I and I just I didn't
[14:35] really feel like I wanted to do that
[14:37] anymore but and I felt trapped this was
[14:39] before Bitcoin and then you know so when
[14:42] I left everything was was T everything
[14:44] was perfect then my parents got sick and
[14:47] then I I started to find out about how
[14:49] inflation works and I started to you
[14:52] know because my thing is that like Wayne
[14:54] grasby says I don't want to skate to
[14:56] where the puck is I want to skate to
[14:58] where the puck is going to be so when I
[15:01] thought about these Financial components
[15:02] all these things were lining up like woo
[15:04] you know in five to 10 years this you
[15:05] know this is going to be a problem for
[15:07] me and my parents depending on how long
[15:09] they live so it just that's how God
[15:11] works man so as soon as I I left and I
[15:13] and I went to the store to get the eggs
[15:15] and I found out about inflation and I I
[15:18] just it just like you know I heard about
[15:19] the Bitcoin I had been looking at it and
[15:21] here's the thing that people of color
[15:22] and people from under underserved
[15:24] communities don't get the way they sold
[15:26] us the Bitcoin they give us this big
[15:28] shiny gold coin coin that's
[15:30] $2,000 and they don't tell you that you
[15:32] can buy little bit little portion of
[15:35] those two of that coin and you're going
[15:37] to be okay so that the way they were
[15:39] framing it you know is for people like
[15:41] it just looked like a $2,000
[15:43] stock that you had to buy all of to get
[15:46] in the game that's what we all thought
[15:48] you know people still think that way and
[15:50] it's not until you have conversation
[15:51] with people who actually own bcoin you
[15:53] can you can buy any you can buy $5 worth
[15:56] of this thing or $10 worth of this thing
[15:58] and just watch it let it you know let it
[16:00] do what it's going to do but that said
[16:01] that's when I found out that okay look
[16:04] you know there there's nothing better
[16:05] than this this like Michael saor say
[16:06] it's like buying Manhattan you know when
[16:08] there's nothing but
[16:11] dirt and that's the way I got into it
[16:13] and and um you know now I coach
[16:16] musicians look if you if you're making
[16:17] if they giving you a $2,000 check every
[16:20] year this year your check is $2,000 but
[16:23] next year that's going to be like 1,800
[16:25] the year after maybe 1700 then it goes
[16:27] down your buying power decreases every
[16:29] time you don't do something to increase
[16:31] your buying power Bitcoin is a hedge
[16:34] against that you know I tell people all
[16:35] especially musicians I even used some of
[16:38] my Bitcoin early on to actually finance
[16:39] a record because I caught it coming up I
[16:42] just took a piece of it and I did a
[16:43] record on it and turned it around and
[16:45] next and that's that's not a it's an
[16:48] asset it's not a Bitcoin asset but I
[16:50] turn it into another asset that you know
[16:51] pretty much will sell for the rest of my
[16:53] life so that's how I use it as well I
[16:54] may use it you know when it gets to a
[16:56] certain level to to record an album
[16:58] against that way to spin anything yeah
[17:00] absolutely it's interesting for me when
[17:03] we talk about things in there um satosi
[17:06] rebranding is something interesting uh
[17:10] many apps are already doing it like I
[17:12] see some Bitcoin exchanges DC some other
[17:16] wallet apps that like give you the
[17:17] option not only look at the Bitcoin
[17:19] amount but also look at the Satoshi
[17:21] amount which are absolutely love because
[17:24] it just feels so much better to have
[17:26] like 100,000 Sates than to have like
[17:30] 0. one Bitcoin like the feeling of it is
[17:33] better even though it does doesn't
[17:35] matter like it's just decimal point that
[17:38] you move but it's definitely does
[17:40] something and I think we have to reprint
[17:43] those atoes at some point especially if
[17:45] Bitcoin now I approaches 100K or 200k
[17:48] people are like oh 200k that's so
[17:50] expensive I cannot buy that that's
[17:52] exactly right and I I I just I I would
[17:55] like I said before just it changed my
[17:57] life because once I started and you have
[17:59] to do the investigation when I when I
[18:01] when I got everything when I when I
[18:03] moved from Boston to uh Arizona I said I
[18:07] was going to investigate everything I
[18:09] could about bit Bitcoin because once I
[18:11] found out I can buy a piece of it I
[18:12] wanted to see how it's gonna H against
[18:14] the inflation and I researched
[18:16] everything I I I maybe spent 25 to 30
[18:18] hours on my way you know driving to
[18:20] California just researching everything I
[18:22] could podcast interviews I think saor
[18:25] was had just come on the SC like I said
[18:26] just come on the scene and some other
[18:27] people so I really wanted to investigate
[18:29] and I would encourage anybody to do the
[18:31] same thing because the the fact of
[18:33] matters this it's programmed to go up
[18:35] well the Dollar's programmed to go down
[18:37] so everybody really needs to think about
[18:39] especially musicians you know so if the
[18:41] value of my assets are gonna as as
[18:43] albums and so on so forth what they tell
[18:45] you in the beginning as musicians write
[18:47] as much as you can own as much as you
[18:50] can because the treat your songs and
[18:52] your albums like real estate because
[18:54] they're going to be become more valuable
[18:56] with time maybe that's true maybe that's
[18:58] not true but you can actually count on
[19:00] it happening with Bitcoin so by the time
[19:02] as I'm dealing with royalties now and
[19:04] that is true because my royalties now
[19:06] are worth more now than they were say 20
[19:07] 30 years ago but coupled with Bitcoin
[19:10] that's why I don't worry about my my
[19:12] retirement because at this point uh I
[19:14] love what I do and I'm going to do what
[19:16] I do until I can't do it anymore and
[19:18] Bitcoin will be there to carry me
[19:19] through once it's what once it's once I
[19:21] get through doing this yeah it's
[19:23] interesting and then we can also come to
[19:26] the um topic of of like what Bitcoin can
[19:30] do for musicians uh the one thing that I
[19:33] want to cover first just come to my mind
[19:35] what does it actually because for me
[19:37] it's a hard time to grasp I'm not a
[19:38] musician I have no clue how musicians
[19:41] make money how how this all this
[19:42] business in general Works what does it
[19:45] mean to to sell a million units is it
[19:48] like a million actually like physical
[19:51] TV
[19:53] it yeah no I'm talking about yes pieces
[19:56] of music singles uh Hardware like you
[19:59] know CD so on so forth from back in the
[20:01] day um and you can include some of those
[20:03] as well that's one it's just the number
[20:04] that I used to do but the majority of
[20:06] time when we're um you know when we get
[20:08] paid and stuff especially with the gigs
[20:09] it's in cash cash or taxs and so on so
[20:12] forth and as soon as that hits the bank
[20:15] account you know uh oh and one one thing
[20:18] that happened the other day which really
[20:19] really telling I go I went to the bank
[20:22] and I had done a deal and the guy flew
[20:24] out to Virginia to get paid in cash so I
[20:26] go to the bank and I say Okay um you
[20:28] know I think the the transation was
[20:30] $115,000 or something but they thought I
[20:33] said
[20:34] $50,000 uh so they said Mr be we don't
[20:37] have that money here I said what do you
[20:39] mean you don't have $115,000 here he
[20:42] said no we just don't carry that much
[20:43] cash it's a bank it's Wells Fargo Bank
[20:45] what do you mean you don't have them and
[20:46] they thought I said 50 rather than 15
[20:48] but it but a sign went off me and they
[20:50] said you know the money's not here you
[20:53] know whatever I put you know if they
[20:55] thought I said 50 what if I did have 50
[20:57] and I wanton the 50 out it's still my 50
[20:59] so I'm said no no no no this whole Bank
[21:01] thing soon and this would this happened
[21:03] about maybe six months ago and that's
[21:05] when I said you know what I'm doing the
[21:06] right thing because if this is I earn I
[21:08] earn this this is hardworking money that
[21:11] I earned and I put it in the bank and it
[21:14] just so happened it's 15 and not 50 but
[21:16] what if it was 50 there was emergency
[21:17] and I need it right away I don't have
[21:19] access to it this is this is one thing
[21:22] that um my friends who don't get Bitcoin
[21:25] yet uh don't get like they are like oh
[21:28] how can you sleep sleep at night when
[21:29] you have like 100% in Bitcoin and I'm
[21:31] like do you have over 10,000 in in the
[21:34] bank account I could not sleep with over
[21:36] 10,000 in the bank account like that
[21:38] would freak me out like I I always like
[21:42] I'm
[21:42] 25 I don't have I don't have kids I
[21:45] don't have like a company or anything
[21:47] like I just have to feed myself so I'm
[21:49] pretty free so I risk at worse I keep my
[21:52] balance like I have the possibility to
[21:54] go like I think to 15,000 in the minus
[21:57] so I just keep my bank account at
[21:59] zero uh and whenever there's money
[22:02] coming in I buy the whole thing down to
[22:04] bitcoin and it's sometimes like I'm in
[22:06] the minus but I don't care there's new
[22:08] money coming in back at zero like the
[22:11] anytime I'm close to to the Plus or like
[22:16] above zero I'm like quick quick quick
[22:20] money quick quick quick to make big
[22:22] account because I don't want it anywhere
[22:24] close to this field system exactly and I
[22:28] can I cannot understand how people can
[22:30] actually be feel safe in that Fe
[22:33] currency uh but a lot of people do like
[22:36] the it's it's hard for me to understand
[22:38] but I also felt secure like I also was
[22:41] really like oh bank account it's it's
[22:43] it's safe it's it's it doesn't go
[22:45] anywhere there's like this security to
[22:48] 100K Euros from the European National
[22:52] from the bank and so that it gives you a
[22:54] good feeling but it's nothing worth like
[22:56] if if they go under it's it's a way but
[22:58] they will print more then the inflation
[23:00] is pretty high right and plus the thing
[23:02] that you sign when you get the the
[23:04] contract says okay you're you're
[23:05] guaranteed to get your money up to a
[23:07] certain amount I just told I just asked
[23:09] you for 15 you thought I said 50 and you
[23:11] told me that I can't get my 50 out I
[23:13] just signed a contract with you it says
[23:14] I'm insured to 250,000 what am I not
[23:17] getting here you know one of my one of
[23:19] my assist one of my associates said to
[23:21] me because he's you know he said Walter
[23:23] I need you to diverse I he's worried
[23:24] about he's a good guy he said I I need
[23:25] you to diverse and so and so you don't
[23:27] want to put all your thing and one
[23:28] basket I said you know what man that
[23:30] that's that's a good thing but let me
[23:32] ask you something what do you think I
[23:34] can get that will give me year over-year
[23:36] 50 to 100%
[23:39] return you said what do you mean I said
[23:41] that's what I'm getting man and that's
[23:42] what we all are getting in Bitcoin you
[23:44] know if you if you you know look at look
[23:46] at it the long side he said are you
[23:47] serious I said yeah that's what I'm
[23:48] trying to tell you is that the fact of
[23:50] matter is if you put one to 10% of your
[23:52] everything you've done in your whole
[23:54] life and that you watch what how
[23:56] supercharges your retirement and that
[23:58] and and like you said it you know it's
[23:59] hard for him to Fathom but I I said man
[24:01] look I'm living proof and all you and I
[24:04] just sent him the charts I said' look
[24:05] study the charts you know see what
[24:07] happens look you know look at it you
[24:09] know and and you invest as you see as
[24:10] you feel comfortable but I'm very
[24:12] comfortable as you just stated that I'm
[24:14] in the best thing that probably I've
[24:16] ever seen in my lifetime or will ever
[24:18] see in my lifetime because of what it's
[24:20] doing for me right now what it did for
[24:22] my parents when they were alive and what
[24:24] it's going to do for me in the
[24:25] future absolutely it's it's so beautiful
[24:29] when you see that and when you notice
[24:31] that like it's it's a saor puts it
[24:33] always so so so great when you're like
[24:36] why would you go in a ship that's not as
[24:39] secure like you you would go in like you
[24:42] have seven ships and you would diversify
[24:44] your kids around all the seven ships but
[24:46] they they they're not as secure as the
[24:48] one you you put the whole family in the
[24:50] most secure ship and not in the in the
[24:53] Wooden Ships so it's it's so powerful
[24:56] once you get like oh yeah it's a cure
[24:59] it's the best form of as but how did you
[25:01] actually come to that like as a musician
[25:04] you you don't have a lot of Financial
[25:06] Training probably how how did you
[25:08] overcome that like oh yeah Bitcoin is
[25:10] the thing especially
[25:11] also I think the the older you get the
[25:16] more adverse your the technology usually
[25:19] was that a hurdle that you overcame um
[25:21] as soon as I found out that it was when
[25:23] I started doing the numbers and I
[25:25] started looking out like 10 15 years and
[25:27] immediately when when it went from that
[25:29] that first run from 3,000 to 9,000 I
[25:31] believe was
[25:33] 2017 and it went up and it came back
[25:36] down but it it just I'm not a major
[25:38] Financial person but when I saw the way
[25:40] it came back down and I saw that the
[25:43] foundation of it was increasing and when
[25:45] I looked back and I saw the foundation
[25:47] kept increasing increasing increasing I
[25:48] said no there's something different
[25:50] about this piece right here this is
[25:51] different I had been in Facebook um IPO
[25:54] I had been in um i' had been Apple early
[25:56] Amazon early so I wasn't scared of this
[25:59] you know I mean I had seen it before and
[26:00] then I saw what the what the what the
[26:02] institutions became and then when I
[26:04] started saying what you know this is no
[26:06] different than what I'm saying only this
[26:07] is got you know 21 million I said this
[26:10] is hot ass and I Tau my just to just to
[26:12] to divert for a minute I have two 12 14
[26:16] year old great niece and nephew right so
[26:19] they they're not they don't live in my
[26:20] house anymore but the the thing that I'm
[26:23] most grateful for is I was able to teach
[26:25] them about inflation and teach them
[26:26] about Bitcoin before they left
[26:28] because now they understand that when
[26:30] they when when they're going to a store
[26:32] and they want to buy something or they
[26:34] want to save money so on so forth they
[26:36] know that the value of that money is
[26:37] going to go down um and the things are
[26:40] going to buy are going to go up so now
[26:41] they got and nobody taught me that like
[26:43] as if you're your question before nobody
[26:45] taught me that until I was well into my
[26:46] 40s or 50s I mean I didn't get it so the
[26:49] technology component didn't really
[26:50] bother me that much as long as as as
[26:52] soon as I figured out um that that I'm
[26:55] going to be okay in five to 10 years my
[26:57] aunt told taught me one thing when I
[26:59] bought my first house I was everybody in
[27:01] the family said oh he's bought little
[27:03] Walt bought a house little wal bought a
[27:04] house congratulations wal so on so forth
[27:07] my aunt came to me and said Son you
[27:08] didn't buy anything the bank owns that
[27:10] house until you pay it off I was like oh
[27:13] she's right so ever since then I'd been
[27:16] thinking about well is there anything
[27:18] that I can invest in that's going to be
[27:20] guaranteed to give me money over time
[27:22] for the long and then when I found
[27:24] Bitcoin was was it I that was it and
[27:26] then when I found I could borrow against
[27:28] it when I started treating it like I was
[27:30] treating my retirement fund when I
[27:32] started treating it like I it was it was
[27:34] a house or better house than I had ever
[27:35] lived in in my life and I and I
[27:37] approached it that way then that's when
[27:38] I started to see the best results just
[27:40] said it and forget it and let it do what
[27:42] it's going to do and you live your life
[27:45] and invest in the things that you want
[27:46] to invest in and bring you Joy and let
[27:48] Bitcoin do what it's going to do and
[27:50] every check that I get now um you know I
[27:53] obviously I'm putting 30 40% in because
[27:55] I like you you know I don't have kids or
[27:57] anything like that
[27:58] I've taken care of my parents I've done
[28:00] what I was supposed to do as a child as
[28:01] a son so now it's just basically let
[28:04] Bitcoin you know uh do what's going to
[28:06] do and I'm going to make myself happy
[28:07] with music and you know and all that
[28:09] kind of stuff so it's just it's just
[28:10] been an asset class well it's just been
[28:12] something that's really enhanced my life
[28:14] uh exponential if you watch or listen to
[28:17] my podcast on a regular basis I'll guess
[28:19] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[28:22] the most important step is to keep the

[29:32] completely new for you guys I partnered
[29:36] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[29:39] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[29:42] saw created by anyone look at that
[29:45] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[29:48] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[29:51] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[29:54] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[29:56] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[30:00] make sure to check out the link in the
[30:02] description for this amazing coin
[30:04] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[30:07] amazing I love them so much it was
[30:09] really hard for me to pick the one that
[30:11] I want to have because there are a lot
[30:13] of great options I went with the new
[30:15] transparency Edition they're all limited
[30:19] so grab yours those will not be
[30:21] available for a long time but there will
[30:23] come new models and new amazing designs
[30:26] along the way yeah and this is what
[30:28] money should do right you you just just
[30:30] get it and put it and you should forget
[30:34] it you should not be forced like I told
[30:36] the story before on the podcast I was
[30:39] before I was in Bitcoin I was like weird
[30:42] with stocks and I picked the stocks and
[30:44] I was actually really good in it and
[30:46] that's why a lot of uh people came to me
[30:49] like hey what do you do with stocks how
[30:51] do how does this work and I always try
[30:53] to explain what I do and I always try to
[30:56] explain how I pick stocks but they did
[30:58] not want to learn how to pick stocks
[31:01] they actually wanted to learn how to
[31:03] secure their financial energy but I
[31:05] didn't get that at the time H but now I
[31:08] get it and that's what people want to do
[31:10] like a doctor want to save the they want
[31:13] to save lives during the day and then
[31:15] they don't want to be a
[31:17] financial portfolio manager in the night
[31:20] that's what Bitcoin is doing you just
[31:22] like pick it and you put it and then
[31:24] then it's great that you asked about the
[31:26] musicianship part of it let's just say I
[31:28] end up or somebody ends up with you know
[31:31] maybe $2,000 $3,000 at the end of the
[31:33] night just like you just said you know
[31:35] you put as soon as you do all that work
[31:37] spend all that time you know you know
[31:40] playing and and and just you're you're
[31:42] exhausted you put the check in the bank
[31:44] and immediately your money starts to go
[31:47] down I mean I'm like well you know and
[31:50] you do that over and over again you know
[31:51] um and and now with Bitcoin I know if I
[31:54] put a a small piece of everything that I
[31:58] do into Bitcoin I don't have to worry
[32:00] about that check diminishing that check
[32:02] in time will be more than that gig was
[32:05] worth in the night that I played it
[32:07] that's all I care about and it Mak me
[32:09] smile as you can
[32:12] see let's talk a little bit about uh I
[32:15] mean we kind of talked touched on it a
[32:17] little bit more but maybe there is
[32:19] something more that that you want to
[32:21] share with us what can Bitcoin now do
[32:23] for musicians what can Bitcoin now do
[32:26] for all those people who great content
[32:28] great music great something M and what
[32:32] can what can Bitcoin do for
[32:34] them the first thing is um you know uh
[32:38] people said well you know get a real job
[32:40] you know and they tell the kids don't
[32:41] ever become a musician don't ever become
[32:43] get a real job because you know that's
[32:45] GNA that's not going to take you far
[32:46] well it'll take you a lot further if you
[32:49] invest in Bitcoin along with what you
[32:51] make during the course of your career
[32:53] you know what I mean so you don't have
[32:54] to fear as you don't have to fear not
[32:56] having money at the end of the day and
[32:58] that that's the fear of many musicians
[33:00] as I when I came up all my favorite
[33:02] music not all but many of them died
[33:04] broke um because there wasn't a savings
[33:06] plan that they didn't know really they
[33:08] weren't financially you know literate
[33:09] and stuff like that but with Bitcoin
[33:11] honestly you know you don't have to be
[33:14] financially literate you know to to to
[33:16] to understand how it works hey I mean it
[33:18] is it is confusing if you get into the
[33:20] weeds and I don't get into the weeds I
[33:22] just the Practical the practicality of
[33:24] it just really moves me so as a musician
[33:27] I can understand the way it's going to
[33:30] operate you know based on algorithms and
[33:32] algorithms and so on so forth and I can
[33:34] be left just to practice the music and
[33:36] to play the music and to and to get a
[33:38] certain amount of income but something
[33:39] is going to go up from let's just say
[33:42] we're at 68 now I guess no no we're at
[33:44] 62 or something like that today let's
[33:46] just say just goes up 30 40 50% you know
[33:49] when you when you when you when you
[33:50] factor when you when you look at it the
[33:51] long way no musician has ever really
[33:54] made that kind of money in percentages
[33:56] over the course of time
[33:58] so if you put every check that you're in
[33:59] you know every if you put 20 30% that
[34:02] eradicates your fear of ending up broke
[34:04] as a musician in the next 10 15 20 years
[34:07] you see what I'm saying so basically it
[34:09] affects my music much better much
[34:10] differently because now I have to worry
[34:12] about will this thing sell or the not
[34:14] sell I can just make the kind of music
[34:15] that I want to make beautiful music and
[34:17] if it's accepted fine as long as I
[34:20] diligently put that money into let
[34:22] Bitcoin um uh let Bitcoin deal with the
[34:26] amount of time that I put into that
[34:27] beautiful piece or playing that
[34:29] performance or so on so forth I don't
[34:30] worry about the future and that really
[34:32] helps my music that's beautiful because
[34:35] this
[34:37] enhances Society at large like once you
[34:41] like that's on an individual level what
[34:43] what Bitcoin can do for musicians
[34:45] Bitcoin do can do basically for everyone
[34:48] um but what if the Bitcoin is the
[34:50] standard like what what if it's normal
[34:53] that our money goes up first of all I
[34:55] think people then have to get used to
[34:57] that their salary might go down that
[35:00] that's something that people maybe have
[35:04] a hard time rubbing their heads around
[35:06] because if you make 5% more uh in the
[35:09] new year but the inflation is 8% your
[35:12] salary went down thank you and in
[35:15] Bitcoin that actually also might happen
[35:17] like your salary might go down because
[35:19] but your salary might go down but maybe
[35:21] you actually could buy more with the the
[35:24] salary from last year that like that
[35:26] there's a lot of interesting F
[35:28] experiments uh in there uh what do you
[35:31] see happening what what what do you
[35:33] imagine once we have a Bitcoin standard
[35:36] once everyone like you and me have this
[35:39] this like Bitcoin standard this sound
[35:41] money this fundament this basis under
[35:44] our feet what could that do to society
[35:47] and to to our human life I just think
[35:51] well first and for first and foremost I
[35:53] think you know unnecessary Wars done
[35:56] done because now you've
[35:58] you've eradicated the the the reason why
[36:00] many people you know are going to do
[36:02] this that this that people then will
[36:04] will will feel so powerful knowing that
[36:07] they don't need to chase this and they
[36:09] Chas the greed is pretty much gone
[36:11] because at the same time I mean you just
[36:13] you're just equal with everybody Bitcoin
[36:15] is The Equalizer you know what I mean so
[36:18] that said you know you're not that part
[36:20] of the stress leaves your life and as I
[36:22] said before when it comes to creating
[36:24] just just musicianship when it comes to
[36:26] being able to create without the fear of
[36:29] ending up broke that is huge man I mean
[36:32] you know it it it allows the mind to go
[36:34] places and different place that's why I
[36:35] I I preach this all the time and I get I
[36:37] let people see exactly what I'm talking
[36:39] about you know percentages and so on so
[36:41] forth I just think as a society you know
[36:43] we end up
[36:45] individually as better people because
[36:47] then we don't need to fear other human
[36:49] beings you know um and I I know I'm
[36:51] sounding stupid but at the same time
[36:53] it's really true because a lot of this
[36:55] is is born of you know inadequacy or
[36:58] inferiority complex or just you know
[37:00] just really crazy stuff that at least as
[37:03] a person of color once I found out that
[37:06] I could be my own bank that I don't need
[37:08] to be treated a certain way if I had
[37:10] Bitcoin I'm My Own Bank I'm my own
[37:12] person I can do what I want to when I
[37:13] want I can take that Bitcoin if I feel
[37:16] like leaving the United States and
[37:17] coming to Austria and and turn it into
[37:19] something whatever you guys you know
[37:21] units are there I can go to El Salvador
[37:23] and live a very comfortable life using
[37:26] just you know just Bitcoin when you
[37:28] actually start having options you know
[37:30] especially as a person of color you
[37:32] become much more you become much more
[37:35] creative human being I think no it's not
[37:37] even about being a person color we all
[37:40] end up being much more creative and much
[37:41] more I think much nicer to each other
[37:43] because we understand that we have the
[37:46] power um to not be afraid of other
[37:49] people because of Bitcoin in a sense I
[37:52] don't if that sounds you know crazy or
[37:54] not but that's that's how I feel about
[37:55] it man I take care you know I'm dieting
[37:58] better now I'm taking care of my body
[38:00] better now because you know because I
[38:02] want I don't know some kind of
[38:03] relationship with Bitcoin that I have it
[38:05] makes me not want to eat the dumb food
[38:07] you know that kind because there's
[38:08] something out there that like I said
[38:10] before is giving me something for my
[38:13] time is giving me something for you know
[38:16] my creation is making everything better
[38:18] you know in my life so I want to be
[38:20] around I want to to be around in life to
[38:22] experience more of it and I think that's
[38:24] what it does not only for musicians but
[38:26] for people from all different back
[38:28] all it's it's really interesting where
[38:30] do you
[38:31] see bitcoin's full potential do you feel
[38:34] that or do you see that Bitcoin actually
[38:37] replaces all the fear currencies will
[38:39] actually be the main store value
[38:43] main that would be great I don't know
[38:46] but I I that would be great I I I don't
[38:48] know like I said before I don't I'm not
[38:50] a Bitcoin expert but you know as I see
[38:53] as I look into the future I'm just so
[38:56] I'm happy as to what the options are
[38:59] with Bitcoin I think I think they're
[39:01] gonna have to adopt it
[39:03] because it's it's it begs to be adopted
[39:06] you know people are going to come in
[39:08] here with the ETF flowing and all this
[39:10] big money coming in here stuff like that
[39:11] and now as it gets more and more I won't
[39:13] say expensive but as it matures now in
[39:15] the 60s it goes you know the last dip we
[39:17] had would it go down to maybe 50 52 and
[39:19] just CRP back up ever so beautifully to
[39:22] 60 you know I'm like yeah that's my
[39:24] Bitcoin so it becomes much more uh
[39:27] mature as an asset class I guess or much
[39:30] more mature as as a as whatever it is
[39:33] and people can start believing okay now
[39:35] now what well now what are you gonna say
[39:37] now you know no it didn't big dip back
[39:40] to 5,000 and so maybe it will maybe it
[39:42] won't but it's programed to do a lot
[39:44] better than than it's going to be doing
[39:45] now so I just think that for me um like
[39:50] I said before I got in and I did I
[39:52] wasn't I was scared I was a little bit
[39:54] scared of it because it just it was so
[39:55] different you know it was very very
[39:57] different but then Bitcoin when it when
[40:00] I started watching and do what it does
[40:02] on the dayto day week to week month to
[40:04] month even was two years it just didn't
[40:06] do anything at around 20,000 and I
[40:08] wasn't worried because I had already had
[40:10] a relationship with Bitcoin and it
[40:11] showed me its potential you know so I
[40:14] wasn't worried I just that was the time
[40:15] when I put more money in because I knew
[40:17] and I was hoping that it stayed down a
[40:18] little bit longer a little bit longer so
[40:20] I can actually invest in her more
[40:22] because she had invested in me prior to
[40:24] that you know little dip for the two
[40:25] years because I knew it was I knew it
[40:26] was going to come because it's
[40:28] programmed to do what it's going to do
[40:30] so I just you like I said before it's
[40:32] just um you know once once you're
[40:33] investing in it once she starts giving
[40:35] you I call her her I call everything her
[40:37] that actually gives a value so when she
[40:40] starts you know um taking care of you I
[40:43] start like I said before uh I become
[40:45] much more uh content in the future give
[40:48] you a perfect example of something I
[40:50] gave my sisters I think about $1,000
[40:52] worth of bitcoin in 19 and the year
[40:56] afterwards I you know they they sold it
[40:58] of course cuz they were scared of it and
[41:00] the year out checked it the year
[41:01] afterward it was worth W let me get this
[41:03] right
[41:04] 2,300 and now that with Bitcoin to
[41:07] 54,000 whatever it was it was worth
[41:10] $14,000 an investment of $1,000 turned
[41:12] into
[41:13] $144,000 and I I tried to tell them I
[41:15] said see if you had just left it there
[41:17] and just going about to you didn't have
[41:19] it before before I gave it to you just
[41:21] leave it there so you can see what it's
[41:23] going to do and once I tell people that
[41:26] story and once people do their do
[41:28] diligence there was a a lady who I gave
[41:30] $400 worth of bitcoin to um a couple
[41:33] years ago and it doubled tripled I
[41:35] believe and she was totally totally
[41:37] blown away because she had forgotten not
[41:39] giving it to her and now she's all in so
[41:42] these are the stories that anecdotally
[41:44] of course you know that that that you
[41:46] get people interested in and I think
[41:47] it's just it's just a miracle and it
[41:49] could be a miracle for for the black
[41:52] community the brown communities just so
[41:53] you know just just because we still have
[41:56] to give what we have to give with as a
[41:57] people here you know and to be able to
[41:59] be your own banker and not to go into I
[42:02] think that in the near F not in the near
[42:03] future but my niece and my nephew won't
[42:06] even probably be dealing with banks in
[42:07] the future you know and that's a good
[42:10] thing for me you know because I I don't
[42:12] have good experiences with banks so and
[42:15] I I see no down I see no um problems
[42:19] with dealing with Bitcoin as a as as as
[42:22] a you know in everything that we do you
[42:25] know being able to pay but I quantry
[42:27] only quantry that I have with it is that
[42:29] I don't want to spend it now at all
[42:32] period I just want to watch
[42:35] it but at some point you you have to
[42:38] spend it or take it to to your grave or
[42:40] give it to your yeah yeah and but you
[42:43] know what like you just said those are
[42:44] options that I didn't have before
[42:46] Bitcoin that's amazing that's the beauty
[42:49] of yeah I love it a lot what you're
[42:51] saying and I I L it that uh that I have
[42:55] y because um like I have a very wide
[42:59] range of of guest on usually usually
[43:02] like really hardcore bit corner but I
[43:05] love like I had last week a science
[43:08] teach on I saw that was never was never
[43:10] on on any other program and it was
[43:13] wonderful to talk with him uh you now as
[43:16] a musician here so it's like I just want
[43:19] to create the the space to let people
[43:23] outside of the usual ones that every
[43:28] also speak I mean I also have them on
[43:30] yeah but but I just want to have a
[43:33] really wide range of of guests and and
[43:35] opinions and perspectives on bitcoin and
[43:37] I think if we then come together and
[43:40] like create something of like
[43:44] directional from all those opinions I
[43:46] think we get some interesting directions
[43:49] that's also something that I'm currently
[43:51] working on like getting a an article or
[43:53] a book I don't know where where I go
[43:55] with that MH on like where is Bitcoin
[43:58] headed what what is bitcoin doing for a
[44:00] society from all those different
[44:02] opinions I'm really
[44:04] um those conversations outside of the
[44:07] usual Bitcoin group usually opens my
[44:09] mind oh that that's what people actually
[44:12] want from Bitcoin like yeah Bitcoin are
[44:15] sometimes too deep into the topic that's
[44:18] right that's right that and that's what
[44:19] when I you know when I saw and I saw the
[44:22] diversity that you had going on in your
[44:23] channel I was like this is one of the
[44:24] three channels I've seen there's so many
[44:27] people Bitcoin has touched you know um
[44:29] and obviously you get into the weeds
[44:30] with it because you're Pro you know but
[44:33] when I I saw some of the others I like
[44:35] you know what I'd like to you know and
[44:38] and help people who may not be thinking
[44:40] about this as an you know for them
[44:42] because even just with with the savings
[44:44] man just I mean you're talking about you
[44:45] could spend you I spent hours trying to
[44:49] convince people and and convinced some
[44:51] that look you
[44:53] know real estate is not going to get you
[44:56] this you you know um you know the the
[44:58] stocks and bonds are not going to get
[45:00] you this man I mean I'm I've been eight
[45:02] years now and that's not a long time but
[45:03] it's long enough for me to to let you
[45:05] know that look this has never happened
[45:07] to me before in my life and I've been
[45:08] invested in some of the other stuff but
[45:10] but this is just a once in a-lifetime
[45:12] opportunity and had I known about this
[45:14] while I was still teaching I would have
[45:16] put all my money that you know that I
[45:18] put into the stock market into Bitcoin
[45:20] when I found out what true nature was
[45:22] but I have I was taking care of my
[45:23] parents at the time and two when you
[45:25] take care of your parents and you use
[45:27] Bitcoin to actually help with that which
[45:29] it helped me with at the time because I
[45:31] was able to use it as a house or borrow
[45:33] against that and the interest rate was
[45:35] so low because you know the greed was
[45:38] out the picture you know and racism was
[45:40] out of the picture and so so on so forth
[45:42] I was able to get a a really great
[45:44] interest rate take care of my mother at
[45:46] the best best of my ability and use
[45:48] Bitcoin to do it and you know I I I
[45:52] can't say anything more about that
[45:53] that's just that for a son to be able to
[45:55] do that and have the option to to help
[45:57] take care of his parents with that and
[45:59] and and to get my father excited about
[46:01] the future he didn't I mean he passed
[46:02] two years later but he was just so
[46:03] excited about Bitcoin when I was talking
[46:05] to him about it um and you know
[46:07] something that we shared together
[46:08] talking about bitco what did do today
[46:10] well he couldn't call the Bitcoin he had
[46:11] Alzheimer's but he when he said oh how
[46:13] did he called a 25 cent how the 25 cent
[46:15] do today and I showed him the charts and
[46:17] said well we're up here pop we're up
[46:19] there you know it's come came down a
[46:20] little bit today he said but you don't
[46:21] want to sell that I said no D cuz and
[46:23] then week later it would be up to 20,000
[46:25] he said man that 25 cents is I like call
[46:27] it 25 cents but it was just great being
[46:29] able to share that with him when he was
[46:30] alive just to see something that new
[46:32] that radical he understood even with
[46:34] Alzheimers that this was a once in
[46:36] a-lifetime thing that was happening and
[46:38] as a father and son it was really nice
[46:40] to be able to share
[46:41] that wait but you don't know why he
[46:43] called it 25 cents no he had Alzheimer
[46:46] and he just something happened with he
[46:48] just started calling it 25 cents I don't
[46:50] know why but every time he talked about
[46:52] 25 cents I knew he was talking about
[46:54] Bitcoin that's all probably because of
[46:56] coin or something like that I don't know
[46:58] but that's that's what he got triggered
[47:00] you know that's that's what triggered it
[47:01] but that that was that was nice too to
[47:03] be able to share share something that I
[47:06] thought was so important to the future
[47:08] of our family and the future of of the
[47:10] family of the Human family with him
[47:12] while he was alive that was important
[47:14] and you had um already a long life
[47:17] before Bitcoin what did Bitcoin do do
[47:19] your spending ha behaviors and stuff
[47:21] like that did it actually change
[47:23] something man let me tell you something
[47:25] so I I I did a deal and the first thing
[47:27] that I want to do is just like buy
[47:30] something
[47:31] before after Bitcoin I'm like
[47:36] okay I I don't need this you know let me
[47:39] put this in the Bitcoin because whatever
[47:42] I'm buying here now is not I'm not gonna
[47:44] like it in four years five years I'm not
[47:46] gonna like it in 10 years why am I going
[47:48] to spend this kind of money on something
[47:50] I'm really going to be out of love with
[47:51] the next two or three four or five years
[47:53] anyway let me put into something that's
[47:55] going to give me more value you know the
[47:57] next 10 years and then at that point in
[47:59] time I have more options to do whatever
[48:01] I want to do with it if I don't want to
[48:02] do anything with it I still have that
[48:04] option so it actually grew I grew up
[48:06] once I started investing in Bitcoin
[48:09] because I I was incentivized to save
[48:12] rather than spend and that's what it
[48:13] does I think well to me that's what it
[48:15] did I don't know what it does to anybody
[48:16] else but it really made me want to to
[48:19] think differently about savings because
[48:22] if you think about it you know like I
[48:23] just said before you know you put your
[48:24] money in the bank it's not necessarily
[48:26] going to there if you needed all of it
[48:28] at the same time and that makes that
[48:31] gives me anxiety or gave me anxiety
[48:33] before I started investing in Bitcoin
[48:34] because I know Saturday and Sunday if I
[48:36] need something I got Bitcoin I can take
[48:39] I can do whatever I need to do with it
[48:40] because people like you just said you
[48:41] know that they're you can buy things in
[48:43] it now and I know my I know where my
[48:45] money is and I know what it's doing and
[48:47] I know I could take it out anytime I
[48:48] want to because it's the perfect money
[48:51] and that's what what's what what you
[48:53] know I'm following really big because I
[48:54] can take out my money anytime I want to
[48:57] in whatever spot I need to because it is
[49:01] mine and that that enables me to make
[49:04] better decisions with my life I think
[49:07] you know the the power of knowing that
[49:09] my savings account is in Bitcoin and
[49:12] Bitcoin is working for me
[49:14] 247 and the great thing is also all the
[49:17] bitcoiners are working for you Michael
[49:19] sailor is working for you I'm working
[49:21] for you everyone that's right is is
[49:23] working for you because they are saving
[49:25] in the same a denominator that's right
[49:28] and how beautiful would that be if the
[49:30] whole world is is is working for each
[49:32] other because then we come to a point
[49:35] where um and that's that's a big one uh
[49:38] then we come to a point where we root
[49:40] for each other that's right because if
[49:42] if if all of the sudden someone builds a
[49:46] company who's really successful with it
[49:49] he is doing it for Bitcoin and then I'm
[49:52] profiting from that because he's doing
[49:54] something for Humanity which makes us
[49:56] more productive more effective more
[49:57] whatever depending on what he does and
[50:02] right now I see a lot of like if there's
[50:04] a successful person we Envy them we we
[50:07] we are putting negative things on them
[50:09] that's right but actually it should be
[50:11] the other way around that's they they
[50:14] enhanced a society they did something
[50:17] better like how how much more value do
[50:18] we get because the Apple iPhone was um
[50:23] um uh innovated um how is the World
[50:26] created
[50:27] no I got so so so that's a that's a huge
[50:31] thing for for me we like what if we can
[50:33] all benefit from that and we don't have
[50:35] to pick and choose like stocks and try
[50:38] to time the market and and try to like
[50:41] get some oh which Real Estate or what
[50:43] are the loan terms and all those weird
[50:45] things no we just buy Bitcoin that
[50:48] that's exactly right and like to your
[50:50] point before you know when it was down
[50:53] and someone said Walter what do you
[50:54] think about it nuts down man I don't
[50:55] worry about Bitcoin Bitcoin is going to
[50:57] do what it's supposed to do and you know
[50:59] it it it's the side it's already done
[51:01] you know you know I want to write this
[51:02] song because this song makes me feel
[51:03] good I don't that's something I don't I
[51:05] don't worry about my finances anymore
[51:06] because I know this is going to make me
[51:09] a better man you know in the sense that
[51:10] you know I don't have because this is
[51:12] going the music is going to be better
[51:13] I'm going to be happier because I know I
[51:15] don't have to worry about my finances I
[51:17] just I'm just GNA let it do what it's
[51:18] supposed to do and like you said before
[51:20] you know if it if it's making people
[51:22] better I have no problems with it at all
[51:25] you know because that's exactly the way
[51:26] it should be and I had to watch
[51:28] musicians that I loved um die you know
[51:32] from not having anything at the end of
[51:34] their lives because they invested made
[51:36] bad Investments or just not even bad
[51:37] Investments I'll live their money you
[51:39] know because you know just that that's
[51:42] what happens you know but but to know
[51:44] now that if you probably put you know
[51:47] percentage a small percentage of your
[51:48] savings in Bitcoin that you don't really
[51:51] that you're not going to spend just let
[51:52] Bitcoin do do what it's supposed to do
[51:54] and you'll be very happy in five to 10
[51:56] years I think that's a real problem
[51:58] people standing at the end of their life
[52:01] with more life than yeah than savings
[52:05] that's right all of the sudden uh they
[52:06] have to be supported by their kids so
[52:10] they are putting a burn on their kids
[52:12] and then the kids have to put some day
[52:15] burn on there like that's a a virtuous
[52:18] cycle soad I'm glad I'm glad you said
[52:21] that because my father worked two jobs
[52:23] until he was probably around 70 or 75
[52:26] right
[52:27] and I was wondering I'm like pop why are
[52:28] you doing this why you know this is
[52:30] before Bitcoin and I got it once I got
[52:32] into Bitcoin I said you know he
[52:35] understands that he he may outlive his
[52:38] money and that's got him very nervous
[52:41] very afraid you know when it comes to
[52:43] him his wife they're to they're used to
[52:45] a certain lifestyle he's afraid that
[52:47] because of inflation that he's not going
[52:49] to be able to afford afford the L that's
[52:51] one of the reason why I came out there
[52:52] because he was probably was right and
[52:55] when I came out there and then once we
[52:56] got into both of us got well I got into
[52:58] Bitcoin I shared it with him and we did
[53:00] whatever that's what the the anxiety of
[53:03] that just dissipated because I knew that
[53:06] based upon what I was seeing this was
[53:08] the once in a-lifetime thing that was
[53:09] going to happen and I knew my father
[53:11] would be okay and I do it it's beautiful
[53:14] it's really beautiful um Coming closer
[53:16] to the because it's already close to one
[53:19] hour already the time flew by coming
[53:22] closer to to the end te one question
[53:25] that I always ask my guests
[53:27] before the end what can we learn from
[53:30] you besides all the things that we
[53:31] already talked
[53:33] about again what can yeah what can we
[53:37] learn from you
[53:39] besides the the topics that you already
[53:41] touched on I'm evolving and and and I'm
[53:46] evolving in a way that prior Bitcoin I
[53:49] mean I mean we're still talking about
[53:50] Bitcoin that I wasn't you know that was
[53:52] different um there was more stress in my
[53:56] life it was more I was more afraid of a
[53:58] lot of things in my life before I
[54:01] actually started dealing with Bitcoin
[54:02] and people who and studying people who
[54:04] were you know who could teach me about
[54:06] Bitcoin to not have to to not be able to
[54:10] relax into a system that will enable you
[54:13] to be stronger you know in the next 10
[54:15] or 15 years you know gave me a lot of
[54:18] anxiety get to the investment process
[54:21] that was before afterwards I think now I
[54:24] don't know I don't know if it's true or
[54:25] not but I think became nicer I think I
[54:28] became more giving I think I became um
[54:32] yeah L less anxious because I knew there
[54:35] was something in my life now that if I
[54:38] did like we just I said it twice before
[54:40] if I invested in it it was going to take
[54:43] care of me you know the next five to 10
[54:45] years and I wouldn't have to worry about
[54:46] it and I could share that with people so
[54:48] it allowed me to be nice a nicer human
[54:50] being and to think about others you know
[54:52] in a different kind of way even with the
[54:54] wars are popping off now it makes me
[54:57] even more sad than I probably would have
[54:58] been because you know when you think
[55:00] about it it's always greed it's always
[55:02] the the lesser of what who we are that
[55:04] we get involved in that kind of stuff
[55:06] and if you think about what Bitcoin is
[55:07] designed to do it takes all of that away
[55:10] so that's you know and I hope I don't I
[55:13] hope I'm not sounding weird but that's
[55:14] just the way I feel and uh it's funny
[55:17] because music did that to me earlier on
[55:19] in life and then you kind of get jaded
[55:21] after you it becomes a business or what
[55:22] have you but then comes along Bitcoin
[55:24] and it does the same thing and I'm just
[55:26] grateful for it it's actually almost
[55:28] like religious type of thing you know
[55:29] for me um so um but that you know that
[55:33] that's the way I feel about it U and
[55:35] music has always been my life but I
[55:37] study more about Bitcoin now than I do
[55:39] music it's kind of
[55:40] interesting
[55:43] amazing amazing I love it it's it's
[55:45] really beautiful yeah man I really
[55:47] appreciate the opportunity coming on man
[55:48] I really enjoy what you're doing and I
[55:50] follow you and I support you and I got
[55:52] did get your merch like I said before so
[55:53] just thank you so much for having me on
[55:56] B before we have the actual end
[55:58] routine from where the previous guest is
[56:01] asking a question for the next guest
[56:02] without knowing who the next guest
[56:03] actually is uh yeah uh so the the
[56:07] question for you is how would you apply
[56:09] it's very specific question how would
[56:11] you apply the lightning split payments
[56:13] to make the world a better
[56:15] place and I told you I am not an expert
[56:17] on bitcoin so you need to find
[56:21] another but but I think there's
[56:23] something really interesting for
[56:24] musicians in there because
[56:27] when you think about uh lightning
[56:29] payments and when you think about that
[56:31] split payments like the the small
[56:33] instant payments like h i for example I
[56:36] have Fountain my podcast is on Fountain
[56:39] so people streaming me SATs for every
[56:43] minute they are watching my podcast they
[56:45] are sending me Sates so I get uh from uh
[56:49] people for for example they set their
[56:52] limits themselves that they said like oh
[56:54] per minute I want to give Robin one side
[56:56] or 10 SATs or 20 SATs and I get SATs
[56:59] from that it's not a lot like it's in
[57:01] total it's like I think 20,000 or 30,000
[57:04] Sates uh now that in like the last one
[57:07] two or three months accumulated but it's
[57:10] amazing and this is something I think
[57:14] when apps are going to develop
[57:16] especially for for everything for like
[57:19] they could revolutionize Spotify or or
[57:22] uh the the selling of of Music in
[57:25] general where the artist just gets paid
[57:29] as long as people watch like or as long
[57:31] as people hear it when the people hear
[57:33] it five minutes long the the the song
[57:38] then they get like for that uh I don't
[57:40] know but few sets for that and it's
[57:43] amazing I think it could actually do a
[57:45] lot for artists and content Creation in
[57:48] general that's very true I get it now I
[57:50] give saying yeah no that that would be
[57:52] amazing that it's called Fountain a
[57:55] fountain yes yes like my my my podcast
[57:58] is everywhere basically but also on
[58:01] Fountain uh and there you can basically
[58:04] I will show you after the podcast that a
[58:06] little bit uh it's it's a really cool
[58:08] one yeah okay yeah but that that would
[58:11] be revolutionary too that would
[58:12] definitely help the music industry
[58:14] especially independent musicians yeah
[58:16] yeah because a lot of uh the payment
[58:19] network of feed is also really bad like
[58:22] really inefficient and uh that's a a
[58:25] part that is not as discussed till now
[58:29] where when Bitcoin the payment Network
[58:32] especially with Layer Two with the
[58:33] lightning Network other things that come
[58:35] on top of that uh this could actually
[58:37] enhance a lot of things and make it way
[58:40] more efficient for example um I can on
[58:44] Fountain I get money from streams and I
[58:46] can uh make a split automatically to
[58:50] someone else like for example if I have
[58:52] an editor that edits all my podcasts I
[58:55] can automatic split with him 10% he gets
[58:58] 10% I get the rest and it gets directly
[59:02] within a few seconds where he streams it
[59:05] the one who who listens and then
[59:08] directly to him and to me it's instant
[59:11] pay instant settlement it's in Bitcoin
[59:13] so like there there are a lot of
[59:15] beautiful things in there that uh are
[59:18] working really really nicely so that
[59:20] that that's and then you then also the
[59:22] people that um listening to it they see
[59:25] it oh there has some editor that also
[59:27] getss 10% or I know him or there's like
[59:30] someone it's it's way more transparent
[59:32] and instant and I think we don't even we
[59:35] don't even know can or I can imagine
[59:38] what Bitcoin actually can do for the
[59:39] world true that's very true yeah I
[59:43] definitely need to investigate that
[59:44] that's beautiful man yeah absolutely
[59:48] yeah yeah then thank you uh so much wal
[59:52] for being on and and being part of the
[59:54] show I appreciate that also thank you
[59:56] for everyone uh watching and listening
[59:58] for joining us today as always I'll be
[60:00] back tomorrow with another episode
