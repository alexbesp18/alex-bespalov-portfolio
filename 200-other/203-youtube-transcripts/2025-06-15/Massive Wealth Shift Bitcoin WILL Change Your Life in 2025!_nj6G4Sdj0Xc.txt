[00:00] are you really getting into Bitcoin if
[00:02] you're not taking self- custody of the
[00:03] Bitcoin and I would argue no Bitcoin
[00:05] puts politicians and governments in
[00:08] competition with each other what if they
[00:09] tax it to Oblivion what about capital
[00:11] gains tax what if they do this stuff
[00:12] it's like well if you have Bitcoin in
[00:14] self- custody you just leave you just
[00:15] grab your words and go what happens to
[00:17] all of your other stuff you know your
[00:19] property your registered government
[00:20] accounts your stocks your business
[00:23] nothing else is movable except your
[00:25] Bitcoin if you think there's a
[00:28] 0.1% chance that the government might do
[00:31] something to oppress you and your wealth
[00:33] in the future you should probably just
[00:34] own some Bitcoin and self custody if we
[00:36] have enough bitcoiners that stack SATs
[00:38] religiously stay humble have some self-
[00:40] custody we do have an opportunity to
[00:42] change this country the incentives to
[00:44] lie on a Fiat standard are so great and
[00:46] the incentives to tell the truth are
[00:48] minimal and on a Bitcoin standard that's
[00:49] completely reversed no one's dumb enough
[00:51] to save in dollars right now that would
[00:52] be so stupid to be like all right I got
[00:54] my money under my mattress I'm good to
[00:56] go for 50 years like my kids are going
[00:58] to be so thankful for this 15 Grand I've
[01:00] got for them no one's that
[01:01] [Music]
[01:05] stupid hi Adam how you doing everything
[01:08] fine on your end yeah man we're doing
[01:10] well we're doing well how are you guys
[01:12] well at the Bitcoin well I love
[01:14] that that's right that's actually so
[01:17] that was kind of the the final deciding
[01:19] moment for the company name was so like
[01:22] the actual purpose behind Bitcoin well
[01:25] um is like a well of water um kind of
[01:27] the thought process being uh you know
[01:29] when you go found a new a new
[01:31] jurisdiction or a new land or a new
[01:33] country the first thing you got to do is
[01:34] drill a well and that's you know the
[01:36] water is the is the breath of the of the
[01:39] entire you know spot and so Bitcoin
[01:41] obviously being the key to our financial
[01:43] sovereignty you know Bitcoin well is
[01:45] that first piece but then the double on
[01:47] Tandra of Bitcoin good um it was just
[01:51] like oh this is perfect I just couldn't
[01:53] pass it up and so Bitcoin well came to
[01:55] be that's really cool and and I guess it
[01:58] was a really good year um and it a crazy
[02:00] year this year with the Haring with the
[02:02] ETFs with the 100K and let's see where
[02:05] we go in the last what is it 14 15 days
[02:08] that that we have how was the year for
[02:10] you what what some of your highlights
[02:12] dude you just reminded me that ETFs were
[02:14] earlier this year this has been probably
[02:17] the busiest year in Bitcoin that is
[02:20] absolutely Madness that it was I
[02:23] remember actually 2024 being like whoa
[02:26] you know it's starting off with a bang
[02:28] and then you know here we are Bitcoin
[02:30] just following its uh you know its cycle
[02:32] but yeah man I mean things have been
[02:33] great we've been obviously uh we've been
[02:36] busy we expanded into the all 50 states
[02:38] this year so that's been super great uh
[02:40] we've been working hard on making sure
[02:42] that you know we are really we're a
[02:45] different platform from you know
[02:47] traditional Bitcoin exchanges we're
[02:49] non-custodial you cannot leave coins on
[02:51] platform and um that comes with a whole
[02:53] slew of challenges you're kind of like
[02:55] double educating people in uh oh hey
[02:59] Bitcoin is good you should buy some and
[03:00] oh by the way you can't just leave it in
[03:02] your account here you have to also get a
[03:03] wallet and here's your seed phrase and
[03:05] here's your address and it's like it
[03:07] just is unbundling this entire
[03:09] educational piece um that's probably
[03:11] going to be our greatest advancement in
[03:14] 25 is just picking up that educational
[03:16] piece did you ever think about um making
[03:20] two-step process of like having the
[03:22] options of having also custodial because
[03:25] a lot of new beginners probably are
[03:26] overwhelmed with the 12 words and and
[03:28] the stuff like that
[03:30] yeah it's definitely been um it's topic
[03:32] of mind it has been for for for 10 years
[03:35] um
[03:36] ultimately I feel very um convicted as a
[03:41] bitcoiner that knows better that the
[03:43] easy path is not the path that we should
[03:48] strive for and I think that um I think
[03:51] it's very very important for at minimum
[03:54] custodian and broker to be separated I
[03:57] think that the incentives like FTX does
[04:00] not happen everyone's like like who in
[04:02] their right mind thinks that FTX was
[04:04] good for the industry in 2025 nobody
[04:07] there are right there's there's there's
[04:09] nobody that thinks that um nobody's
[04:11] arrogant enough or stupid enough to
[04:13] think that they were doing good things
[04:15] and um the FTX rug pull frankly is not
[04:18] possible in a non-custodial environment
[04:20] and so I think that you know the
[04:23] argument of um hey wouldn't this be
[04:25] better if more people can on board and
[04:27] more people getting into Bitcoin it's
[04:29] like are you really getting into Bitcoin
[04:32] if you're not taking self- custody of
[04:34] the Bitcoin and I would argue no um I
[04:36] don't think if you hold an ETF you're
[04:38] into Bitcoin I don't think you know if
[04:40] you own mstr you're into Bitcoin um and
[04:44] uh I think that the key to being you
[04:46] know into Bitcoin is is self- custody
[04:49] and so what that means for us is you
[04:51] know obviously targeting a smaller Niche
[04:54] um but doing that small Niche you know
[04:57] as good as possible and then
[05:00] understanding that that Niche like this
[05:01] is going to be the fastest growing niche
[05:04] in the world is bitcoiners that need
[05:08] that finally understand and then need to
[05:09] take self- custody of their Bitcoin
[05:11] that's super interesting I was recently
[05:13] in Abu Dhabi at the Bitcoin conference
[05:15] Bitcoin Mina I think it it was called
[05:17] and there was one main talk at the main
[05:21] stage where I forgot to ask the question
[05:24] but someone asked a question raise your
[05:26] hand uh if you ever tried
[05:30] custody and I was shocked like 50% of
[05:33] the hands went up and yeah maybe maybe
[05:35] 60% because 10% of the audience doesn't
[05:37] want to raise the hands but like but
[05:40] even at a Bitcoin conference uh there's
[05:44] not everyone into self- custody and when
[05:46] I talk to my Bitcoin friends outside of
[05:50] the Bitcoin Community they're like
[05:52] normal friends that just have a lot of
[05:53] money in Bitcoin they all have it on
[05:56] custodial and I'm I'm like trying to
[05:59] Orange P them since four years that they
[06:01] have their are huge savings that they
[06:03] have in Bitcoin move them off
[06:06] exchanges and it's it's a really hard
[06:08] hard topic uh and the question in mind
[06:11] is like okay if we Define a bitcoiner as
[06:14] someone who has his Bitcoin in custody
[06:17] how many are we like small man and this
[06:20] is and this is part of what gives me
[06:22] this this conviction that I'm talking
[06:23] about because
[06:25] if if we all say okay fine we'll just be
[06:29] custodial then no one will need to take
[06:33] self- custody uh we are as as a species
[06:36] the path Le you and I do this for a
[06:38] living we talk about think about Bitcoin
[06:40] 247 man I went and saw a movie with my
[06:42] wife we went and saw Wicked have you
[06:43] seen that movie uh The Wizard of Oz like
[06:48] when when you say Wicked I have to think
[06:51] about Wicked self the the UT takes old
[06:53] guy on
[06:55] Twitter that's exactly you are not the
[06:58] first person that said that so totally I
[07:00] get it but it's uh it's like you know
[07:02] it's like a it's a movie about like
[07:04] Wizard of Oz it's like a Broadway play
[07:05] turned into a movie and uh you know it's
[07:08] like like got like corrupt government
[07:09] and you know Mass misinformation through
[07:11] centralized channels blah blah blah and
[07:14] I like look over my wife and I'm like
[07:16] you know what this movie is about right
[07:17] and she's like if you say Bitcoin right
[07:19] now I'm gonna smack
[07:22] you I'm like but you do know it's about
[07:24] Bitcoin don't you we are always on
[07:27] bitcoin Bitcoin Bitcoin Bitcoin and I
[07:29] think that um there is more and more
[07:33] people who are not always on bitcoin
[07:36] Bitcoin Bitcoin Bitcoin that understand
[07:38] the importance of self- custody and I
[07:40] think that if we have platforms that
[07:42] allow for custodial nonsense to occur um
[07:45] and let let me be super clear what I
[07:47] mean for that is um coins in the same
[07:50] place where you buy I firmly believe
[07:54] that uh self- custody is a barrier I
[07:56] understand that fully and I also think
[07:58] that collaborative custody is a dynamite
[08:01] solution uh meaning you know we as the
[08:04] platform would send your coins to a
[08:07] place that maybe you don't have full
[08:09] control of um maybe you've worked with a
[08:11] with a custodian that's going to um help
[08:14] you take you know partial custody and
[08:17] then and then move that into into full
[08:19] self- custody down the line um but in no
[08:23] uncertain terms are the coins off
[08:26] Bitcoin well we are non-custodial in
[08:28] that way and that is so important
[08:30] because the incentives then become
[08:33] acutely aligned where we want to make
[08:36] the best platform for you to buy and
[08:38] control Bitcoin and not the best
[08:41] platform that incentivizes you to keep
[08:43] Bitcoin with us because um you know
[08:46] there's just issues there you you're in
[08:49] America Canada but Europe not uh or yes
[08:53] we're live in Canada and USA but not in
[08:55] the we did though uh we did buy a
[08:58] Bitcoin ATM Network
[09:00] in 2021 I think in the UK and then like
[09:04] three months later the UK pretty much
[09:06] brought the banhammer for Bitcoin ATMs
[09:09] so we were uh it was a quick entry and a
[09:12] quick exit but uh um yeah it's it's man
[09:16] the EU is it's a sketchy place to be
[09:20] absolutely yeah it's but I have a hope
[09:22] for for them like if you see the last
[09:24] election a lot of and I talked actually
[09:26] today with with someone from Terror has
[09:29] organ iation in Germany and they
[09:31] actually say with the last EU election a
[09:33] lot of the things that they were worried
[09:35] about are now kind of going in the right
[09:38] direction because lot of more right uh
[09:41] leaning parties winning parties that are
[09:43] against the EU parties that see that uh
[09:46] ECP the the Euro and the the whole
[09:49] digital service acts and stuff like that
[09:51] that's going on uh critical those are
[09:54] moving uh those are moving up which
[09:56] means for me that the EU
[10:00] citizens uh uh waking up a little bit to
[10:03] the reality which gives me a lot of Hope
[10:05] if the people wake up in a country
[10:07] hopefully all s the politicians uh move
[10:10] afterwards yeah man I mean they're gonna
[10:12] have to right this is um you know
[10:15] obviously we think it takes too long but
[10:16] this is how the world should work where
[10:18] it should be the people demanding what's
[10:20] best of the politicians not the
[10:23] politicians and the bureaucrats
[10:25] dictating what will enrich them to their
[10:27] citizens and I think that you know
[10:30] what's what's changed like look at look
[10:32] at what has changed over the last 10
[10:34] years and it's been um you know
[10:37] decentralized protocols for for for
[10:40] media for communications uh coupled with
[10:43] you know the number one money protocol
[10:45] on the planet and effectively I think
[10:47] bitcoin's working I I think I would
[10:49] attribute a little bit of that success
[10:51] to bitcoin and bitcoiners having that um
[10:55] that edge of hey you can't control my
[10:58] money anymore I think that's uh that's
[11:01] really really positive and then I think
[11:03] it's really important to note that
[11:06] bitcoiners uh like politicians need
[11:08] Bitcoin but Bitcoin doesn't need the
[11:10] politicians and this this was so and and
[11:13] I don't know if you saw it these did you
[11:15] saw the the German Finance Minister
[11:18] today on his speech talking about
[11:22] Bitcoin no like six months what was it
[11:26] six months they just dumped on the
[11:27] market was that was that what it was
[11:28] yeah the the same Germany the dumped
[11:31] Bitcoin the Finance Minister because
[11:34] today the government is officially in
[11:36] Germany
[11:38] over uh they just collapsed uh and now
[11:41] in February there is a new election and
[11:44] today there was the last speech like the
[11:46] last like uh speech of the government
[11:49] there's like a small uh temporary
[11:52] government till the new election but uh
[11:54] it was the last day and the Finance
[11:56] Minister since four years he's there the
[11:59] first time ever he mentioned Bitcoin and
[12:02] today he was like oh why did we not do
[12:05] that basically and he put everything on
[12:07] the other parties but he was the finance
[12:09] minister so wow man yeah man and that
[12:12] that that's it like Bitcoin humbles you
[12:14] like it I think what you said is so is
[12:16] so perfect um and it it it leads us down
[12:19] this track of understanding that Bitcoin
[12:21] kind of puts politicians and governments
[12:24] in competition with each other and you
[12:27] know like people are all afraid
[12:29] well what if they what if they tax it to
[12:31] Oblivion what about capital gains tax
[12:33] what if they do this stuff it's like
[12:34] well if you have Bitcoin in self-
[12:36] custody you just leave you just you just
[12:39] grab your words and go like it's like
[12:41] it's that's it's the easiest answer in
[12:44] the world what happens to all of your
[12:46] other stuff you know your property your
[12:48] your your registered government accounts
[12:51] your stocks your business like nothing
[12:53] else is movable except your Bitcoin and
[12:57] so if you think there's a
[12:59] 0.1% chance that the government might do
[13:02] something to oppress you and your wealth
[13:05] in the future you should probably just
[13:07] own some Bitcoin in self- custody this
[13:09] is the this is the math this is the
[13:11] logic there's there's literally no
[13:13] downside especially if you're already
[13:15] going to own Bitcoin it's crazy it is
[13:18] yeah it's mind-blowing to me and there's
[13:20] in every count a 0.01% chance that that
[13:24] happens
[13:25] World absolutely um and you are from
[13:29] Canada I I think yeah
[13:33] so how is Canada right now I the Canada
[13:36] is for me always the the tracker
[13:37] movement and still until then I only
[13:41] heard even worse things from trudo with
[13:44] like at some point even like with a
[13:46] credit system like in in in in Social
[13:48] credit system like in China I heard some
[13:50] uh news around that but I don't really
[13:53] follow the Canadians news cycle how is
[13:55] Canada right now and one more thing that
[13:58] I want to give with that most Canadians
[14:00] I talk to most Bitcoin Canadians I talk
[14:02] to already outside of of Canada for for
[14:05] some reason how is Canada and Bitcoin
[14:07] right now yeah man um Bitcoin is very
[14:11] needed in Canada right now you're right
[14:12] like the the trucker protest I think
[14:14] woke everybody up um The Tyranny went
[14:17] too far the the outright lies went too
[14:20] far and a large portion of Canada woke
[14:25] up to what's happening and it created a
[14:27] lot of bitcoiners in the country
[14:30] um still though which is hilarious if
[14:33] you I bet you one in five people that
[14:35] you talk to on the street would say that
[14:38] the trucker protest was a was a
[14:40] terrorist
[14:41] organization and they were creating mass
[14:44] U Mass Terror that this is this is the
[14:46] this is the federal narrative for that
[14:47] for that protest and um and it's
[14:51] shocking and so I think that um that's
[14:54] really really interesting just seeing
[14:56] that you know lots of people are awake
[14:58] to the fact that the government is evil
[15:01] here in Canada um but there's still you
[15:04] know there's still a grip there's still
[15:06] a healthy grip on the population um that
[15:08] said I think that Canada is producing
[15:10] some of the most hardened bitcoiners
[15:13] than any Nation per capita we've got to
[15:15] be the best nation in the world for
[15:17] bitcoiners coming out of Canada and the
[15:20] community here is strong I think that
[15:23] it's just because the the level of
[15:25] tyranny that we experience here the
[15:27] banking like the centralization we've
[15:29] got monopolies in Telecom monopolies in
[15:32] banking um we've got monopolies in in
[15:35] power and energy um we're just Canada
[15:38] loves its monopolies and the free market
[15:41] hates them and you know we finally have
[15:43] a tool to take that power back in
[15:45] Bitcoin people are finding it and people
[15:47] are using it and I think we're pushing
[15:49] back a little bit so it's pretty good is
[15:51] there hope like is there elections
[15:53] coming up I think I heard something with
[15:55] next year's elections next year they'll
[15:56] have an election um I don't put much
[15:58] hope in
[15:59] frankly I don't think elections like
[16:02] they maybe steer you back into the path
[16:04] but the whole system has to be
[16:06] completely rebuilt um you know everyone
[16:09] is like like Trump will do probably good
[16:12] things for lots of things and he's still
[16:15] going to print probably trillions of
[16:17] dollars and when you think that the good
[16:20] guy is going to be printing trillions of
[16:22] dollars you realize that the system is
[16:25] completely broken and uh it's kind of
[16:28] irrelevant from my perspective which
[16:30] color is in the chair I think that
[16:32] bitcoiners and as bitcoiners we we we
[16:34] are called to a much higher standard
[16:35] than fighting across the aisle and um
[16:39] you know our our seemingly incoming
[16:41] Premier um his name is Pierre POV um he
[16:46] he understands sound money he
[16:48] understands fiscal responsibility and
[16:49] good economic policy and all that's very
[16:51] positive I think that that it will
[16:52] obviously be a massive positive um but
[16:55] he will still be printing money and he
[16:57] will still be funding a government that
[17:00] spends more than it than it than it
[17:01] brings in we will still have record
[17:03] taxes we will still have a record high
[17:05] capital gains rate um it will still not
[17:07] be a Bitcoin standard environment and I
[17:10] think that we are still probably decades
[17:12] away from that Bitcoin standard
[17:14] environment but I will say there is hope
[17:18] I think that there is enough people that
[17:21] you know because you're right people are
[17:22] leaving people in Canada there's lots of
[17:24] Canadians abroad um and even my wife and
[17:27] I decided um you know we're we're we're
[17:29] discussing like what do we do do we stay
[17:31] do we go where do we go what's better we
[17:34] have four kids and so raising the
[17:35] children in a good environment is very
[17:37] important to us and we ultimately landed
[17:40] on um you know staying in Canada with me
[17:43] having a a a unique opportunity to have
[17:46] a hand in Saving this country um because
[17:49] I think it's possible I think that if we
[17:50] have enough bitcoiners that stack SATs
[17:52] religiously stay humble you know have
[17:55] some self- custody um we do have an
[17:57] opportunity to change this country
[17:59] and I'm bullish on that for sure it's
[18:02] super interesting that debate because we
[18:03] always say like we said it today in the
[18:06] podcast already uh that that Bitcoin the
[18:09] politicians need Bitcoin Bitcoin doesn't
[18:10] need politicians uh but at the same time
[18:13] we are human beings in a physical
[18:15] environment in a jurisdiction that has
[18:18] control over us that cares about us in
[18:21] in a good and a bad sense caring about
[18:23] us um so it's like as a Bitcoin are you
[18:27] in that weird position you have an said
[18:29] that doesn't care about politics but you
[18:31] still should care what politics uh does
[18:34] to you and and what what kind of rules
[18:36] they lay on you and what kind of this
[18:38] the system does even though I see a lot
[18:41] of bitcoiners that say like I don't want
[18:43] to do anything with politics and I just
[18:46] live my life which I think could be
[18:49] dangerous to yourself how do you look at
[18:51] like how much should we pay attention
[18:53] and care about the the political systems
[18:56] and the change that we are seeing yeah
[18:59] man I probably go back and forth um from
[19:02] you know this kind of like ah whatever
[19:05] it's all rigged anyways and you know I'm
[19:07] gonna just put my head down and do what
[19:09] I can back to like oh hey maybe I'll
[19:12] have the ability to influence and make
[19:15] positive change and I I I I probably
[19:18] bounce between those two mindsets like
[19:20] very frequently I think that my current
[19:23] mindset so you're getting you know talk
[19:24] to me tomorrow and maybe it'll be it'll
[19:26] be different um but I would probably
[19:29] fall in the mindset of um having
[19:31] cautious optimism that the efforts we're
[19:34] making will make a change um coupled
[19:37] with understanding have you heard of the
[19:39] Cobra effect Cobra no no I didn't it's
[19:43] it's this uh the Cobra effect is this
[19:44] concept that an unnatural Force um kind
[19:48] of putting energy or restrictions into
[19:50] an environment will always have negative
[19:52] effects on the macro and so it's it
[19:54] stems from like the 1500s the British
[19:57] government took over um uh India and
[20:00] there was bunch of cobras like wild
[20:02] Cobras were eating the the citizens of
[20:04] India and so the British government you
[20:07] know in their Royal in their royalty
[20:08] decided that was bad and and so they
[20:10] they put a bounty on Cobra's heads um so
[20:13] that the citizens were incentivized to
[20:15] go out and kill the cobras and then get
[20:17] paid for it it was kind of like you know
[20:19] decentralized work gig working maybe it
[20:21] was the first ever gig working they
[20:23] probably didn't have an app to go and
[20:24] track the cobras but um you know and so
[20:28] then after a while some people started
[20:30] taking advantage breeding cobras and
[20:33] then bringing the bred cobras to the
[20:34] government for for beheading uh which is
[20:38] wrong it's immoral um but it was
[20:41] something that was legal and so um
[20:45] afterwards the government you know was
[20:47] probably feeling salty and decided to to
[20:50] do away with the Cobra um Bounty and so
[20:53] all the farmers let the cobras loose and
[20:56] the Cobra problem got 10 times worse
[20:59] than it was you know before the
[21:01] government stepped in and tried to fix
[21:04] everything with their magic wands and so
[21:06] I think that back to you know your
[21:08] question um the government will put in
[21:10] rules and we can be Cobra Farmers we can
[21:14] be the ones that take advantage of the
[21:16] rules that look around how to manipulate
[21:20] the rules how to better Society in spite
[21:23] of their rules and I look back to the
[21:25] mission for Bitcoin well um it's to
[21:28] enable Independence and so you know it
[21:30] is important that I have a a very strong
[21:33] handle on what the rules are so that I
[21:36] can learn and figure out how to
[21:38] manipulate the rules in such a way that
[21:40] I am enabling maximum Independence and
[21:44] um so yeah I think that's kind of where
[21:45] I land today you know Bitcoin well we're
[21:48] like we're publicly traded we are
[21:50] obviously a money service business in
[21:52] you know in Canada and and you know on
[21:55] that track in the US and it's kind of
[21:57] like we got to know I'm you know
[22:00] personally I I'm going to you know Vote
[22:03] or or or wish and cheer for the
[22:05] politician that will make my business
[22:07] more successful and my mission more
[22:10] possible um where it gets tricky is do I
[22:15] believe that
[22:16] politicians will do that and that's kind
[22:19] of you know on either side of the
[22:21] aisle experience that myself this I I
[22:24] voted differently um this year round
[22:27] than last year round because because of
[22:28] the business and I was like my
[22:30] incentives are now different and this uh
[22:32] changes my vote actually which is super
[22:34] interesting but uh it's a great story of
[22:38] yours to see how centralized systems
[22:42] bring the the wrong incentives they they
[22:46] trying even if they try to do the right
[22:48] thing they might do the wrong thing with
[22:50] that Dingo and it's and it's this um you
[22:54] know I do personally believe that there
[22:56] is a spiritual Darkness in in the world
[22:59] that is trying to take over but I also
[23:04] probably understand that there is
[23:07] well-intentioned
[23:08] problems that come in because it's an
[23:11] unnatural force in a natural environment
[23:15] great example right now in Canada uh the
[23:17] government just put a pause on GST our
[23:20] general sales tax um which you know is
[23:24] like okay great you know like things get
[23:26] a little bit cheaper 5% you know the
[23:28] federal sales tax that's fantastic um
[23:32] but let's look at the downstream effects
[23:34] here uh it was only on certain things it
[23:36] wasn't widespread it was only in in
[23:38] certain areas and so I have a a a buddy
[23:41] uh one of our our ATM hosts and a
[23:43] prominent member of the Vancouver
[23:44] Bitcoin Community he owns a cafe and he
[23:47] was saying um so they still have to
[23:51] charge GST on merch but not on coffee
[23:56] and food and so he had to to spend an
[23:59] entire day going through every single
[24:02] skew of his point of s system and
[24:05] turning on or turning off uh the GST and
[24:09] then he's gonna have so so it's for two
[24:12] months starting in December which means
[24:13] you have the end of the year and in the
[24:15] start of the year so two tax years with
[24:18] this you know this weird no GST this
[24:22] partial sales tax for two years um and
[24:25] then what that's going to do is it gives
[24:28] everybody the uh um the incentive to
[24:33] probably not spend more but to realize
[24:35] how bad you know GST makes things so
[24:38] it's creating more accounting costs
[24:40] probably legal costs down the line for
[24:43] whatever and operational costs all for a
[24:47] two-month break and it's just like you
[24:49] know that was probably well-intentioned
[24:51] it probably didn't think about it and
[24:53] that's kind of the problem that they
[24:54] didn't think about it they don't have
[24:56] the foresight to think how is this going
[24:59] to help or hurt and I and I related it
[25:01] back to the Village Idiot running around
[25:04] in the winter lighting people's houses
[25:06] on fire to keep them warm and it's like
[25:09] yes Village Idiot fire does create
[25:11] warmth but when you burn someone's
[25:13] shelter it doesn't help anybody and the
[25:17] government is just in a habit of burning
[25:19] shelter to try to keep people warm is
[25:22] that what you mean with spiritual
[25:25] darkness no I think it's deeper than
[25:27] that um
[25:29] I think there's I think there is like
[25:31] there's a a
[25:32] physical um presence in the world that
[25:36] um you know exists that we can see and
[25:37] touch and there's a spiritual one and I
[25:40] think that um you know the spiritual one
[25:44] um probably has a lot more influence in
[25:48] in our world than we realize and um you
[25:53] know being aware of that is is probably
[25:58] um important and I think that you know
[26:01] part of the part of the denamic nature
[26:04] or demonic nature of that uh of that
[26:07] negative Spirit or that dark Spirit um
[26:10] is stemmed by Fiat money stemmed by
[26:13] governments and politicians being able
[26:15] to you know Hammer a button and steal
[26:18] people's wealth um that's a very evil
[26:20] thing to do and I would I would say that
[26:22] there's a difference between the village
[26:25] idiot trying to keep people warm and and
[26:29] the demon that whispered in the village
[26:31] idiot's ear hey go burn the houses to
[26:36] keep the people warm the demon knows the
[26:38] the the the dark Spirit whatever you
[26:40] want to call it they know that it's
[26:42] wrong and they've taken the idiots um to
[26:45] be useful and I think that's kind of
[26:47] more the the play in politics that I see
[26:51] it's interesting yeah it's is also for
[26:53] me always interesting when centralized
[26:55] organizations think they can predict
[26:57] something thing which they clearly can't
[27:00] predict uh which oh yeah I mean the most
[27:02] obvious thing is the central government
[27:05] that tries to are the central um central
[27:08] banks that try to predict now like how
[27:10] much money should we print today let's
[27:12] see what we do we predict that
[27:14] unemployment will be X it's like
[27:17] how what what happens if x y and like
[27:21] how how are you even qualified to look
[27:23] at on the macro you know what businesses
[27:25] are going to need or you know even even
[27:27] like even for smaller things like
[27:29] purchasing patterns and Habits Like who
[27:32] who predicted toilet paper being you
[27:34] know such a hot commodity in 20121 or
[27:36] whenever the covid thing happened like
[27:38] you know you don't you don't get to
[27:40] predict this stuff you don't get to to
[27:42] to think that you've got this allseeing
[27:44] eye and this allseeing power that's not
[27:46] how a free market works and I think
[27:48] that's evidence the fact that they are
[27:49] so bold into making these predictions
[27:53] and having these you know insights into
[27:55] the world just shows like the audacity
[27:57] shows us that
[27:59] um they have a lot of control and they
[28:00] have more control than they let on and I
[28:02] think that's that's a problem and I
[28:03] think that Bitcoin ultimately solves
[28:05] that completely I would when we look
[28:07] back at 2020 how would that be different
[28:10] when we would have a complete uh Bitcoin
[28:13] standard because they printed a lot of
[28:15] money back then yeah well here's the
[28:18] thing a Bitcoin standard is so much
[28:21] deeper than the money it's a proper
[28:23] incentivized system that is you know has
[28:26] some meritocracy to it and has optimism
[28:30] and
[28:31] has the smart people teaching and not
[28:35] afraid and I think that the reason covid
[28:38] was able to happen in the way that it
[28:40] did was because nobody we've gone now
[28:44] two generations off the gold standard
[28:47] and because of that we are not taking a
[28:50] first principles approach to thoughts
[28:53] anymore and um we've gotten very very
[28:57] use in our Society to money being this
[29:00] abstract tool and so when they say you
[29:03] know put this cloth on your face so that
[29:06] you will stay safe um people say okay
[29:09] they don't think like really how you
[29:12] know if I told you to burn your house to
[29:14] keep warm in the winter it that would be
[29:16] dumb you would you would obviously be
[29:17] like well hey wait a second I wouldn't
[29:19] have a house anymore how how will that
[29:21] keep me warm um and that's like a big
[29:24] obvious one but these little tiny micro
[29:25] ones that that we are kind of getting
[29:27] now
[29:28] um you know this is like here in Canada
[29:31] I'm not sure what it's like in in
[29:32] Austria but like we have paper straws to
[29:34] eliminate um plastic which is like you
[29:38] know kind of dumb but let's just run
[29:40] this down for a second so the response
[29:42] to that was serving a plast or a drink
[29:46] in a plastic cup with a paper straw or a
[29:51] plastic cup with a plastic lid and this
[29:54] fancy like drinking apparatus which
[29:58] statistically uses 80% more plastic than
[30:00] a straw so it's
[30:03] like okay so we wanted to reduce so
[30:06] again there's just zero logic it's like
[30:08] but there are people that believe like
[30:10] oh yeah we're doing we're doing the
[30:11] Lord's work here we're we're solving the
[30:14] plastic problem you know we don't this
[30:16] straw sucks but I'll do it willingly
[30:18] because the man on the TV told me that
[30:20] this is saving the Earth and it's like
[30:22] off we go you know here in Canada
[30:24] especially there's a mountain of people
[30:27] that believe Canada is a net polluter
[30:29] when in fact we have as we have so much
[30:31] Forest here in Canada that our trees
[30:34] consume
[30:35] 110% of all of the pollution that Canada
[30:39] like all CO2 that Canada throws into the
[30:41] sky our trees consume 110% of it we
[30:45] actually have an under pollution problem
[30:47] here in our country and yet man on the
[30:50] TV says otherwise and so we better pay
[30:53] the tax we better you know like abide by
[30:56] the rules and and I think that on a
[30:58] Bitcoin standard you are actually
[31:00] incentivized not to listen to the man on
[31:02] the TV because the man on the TV whether
[31:05] it be politician or a news guy or like
[31:07] whatever um and and and and I guess also
[31:10] he has an incentive to tell the truth
[31:12] and not to lie because by lying they
[31:15] feed their families like the incentives
[31:17] to lie on a Fiat standard are so great
[31:20] and the incentives to tell the truth are
[31:22] minimal and on a Bitcoin standard that's
[31:24] completely reversed where the incentive
[31:25] to tell the truth is very very great and
[31:28] the incentive to lie is very damning
[31:30] because when you have a money spigot
[31:32] your main goal is to get close to the
[31:34] spigot the closest guy gets the most
[31:36] cash um and you do whatever you need to
[31:39] to get there right it's like being a
[31:41] part of a gang like you know you'll kill
[31:43] people to get closer to the gang leader
[31:45] because you know that will better your
[31:47] family and your and your future uh but
[31:50] without the gang leader you just want to
[31:52] do right by everyone you have to kind of
[31:54] you know tread lightly in society and be
[31:56] bold but be but be fair and be balanced
[31:58] and be equal and and all this stuff and
[32:00] so I feel like the Bitcoin standard
[32:03] incentivizes that whereas the Fiat
[32:04] standard it just incentivizes you to to
[32:07] lie and cheat to get closer to the guy
[32:09] that's lying and cheating the best I
[32:11] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[32:15] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[32:18] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[32:20] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[32:23] vigilante made a perfect Bitcoin watch
[32:26] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[32:30] go out there and show that you are a
[32:32] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[32:35] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[32:38] dropped a completely new and amazing
[32:40] Genesis edition of their watch
[32:43] collections you have the date of the
[32:45] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[32:49] and of course also the block height and
[32:51] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[32:55] level of detail they put in in this
[32:57] Masterpiece and make sure to check out
[33:00] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[33:03] down in the descriptions I love those
[33:05] watches so so much if you watch or
[33:09] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[33:11] I'll guess you already bought some
[33:13] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[33:16] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[33:19] in a hardware wallet my personal
[33:21] recommendation for hardw wallet is the
[33:23] bit box it's super secure it's simple to
[33:26] set up it's also perfect gift for a
[33:28] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[33:31] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[33:34] with the code Robin at the checkout
[33:36] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[33:40] your bitbox and the next step is to
[33:43] really level up your sovereignty as an
[33:45] individual you have to have the most
[33:48] secure self- custody setup you have to
[33:50] secure your own devices you have to
[33:53] protect your privacy you have to set up
[33:56] an inheritance plan and depending on
[33:58] where you live you even want to have a
[34:01] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[34:04] in case something goes really really
[34:05] wrong and through all those steps the
[34:07] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[34:10] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[34:13] way.com
[34:15] Partners robobin you even get a 30
[34:17] minute free call to find out how you can
[34:20] level up your sovereignty that's an
[34:24] beautiful description of that like the
[34:26] the Bitcoin brings us closer to the
[34:28] truth because it
[34:29] incentivizes uh good behavior and
[34:32] incentivizes uh truthful and integral
[34:35] Behavior versus I just want to be closer
[34:38] to the money printer yeah literally man
[34:40] and that's but that's the state and so
[34:42] we did a video um I have a show called
[34:45] future proof that um I do with with get
[34:47] based um and we did a video on the
[34:51] difference between um corporatocracy and
[34:54] capitalism and they look similar and i'
[34:56] never heard this this Con of corpocracy
[34:58] before um but it's effectively where
[35:01] these large corporations become arms of
[35:03] the government and it's uh you kind of
[35:06] see it in our nation now and what I
[35:08] deduced from all this you you know this
[35:10] like quick video we did on it was you
[35:13] can tell a nation heading into a
[35:16] corpocracy by the company's budgets and
[35:20] if the budget is spent on marketing that
[35:22] is a budget for the people that is a is
[35:24] a free market budget that's some that's
[35:26] someone wanting to make something and
[35:29] give it to as many people as possible
[35:30] talk to their consumers but when the
[35:33] budget is spent on lobbying that is not
[35:36] a budget for the people that is a budget
[35:38] that is designed to appease the
[35:40] bureaucrats to appease the politicians
[35:42] to appease the money spigot and you can
[35:44] tell who a company cares about by where
[35:47] they put those dollars is it into you
[35:50] know Lobby groups or into customer
[35:52] groups and frankly we we we want a
[35:54] customer group Society right we don't
[35:56] want to be a group that just pays the
[35:59] lobby people to go and pay the few
[36:01] people to make our lives easier we want
[36:04] a group of entrepreneurs and businesses
[36:06] doing the hard thing and talking to the
[36:08] customers and you know working in spite
[36:11] of the politicians and I think that
[36:13] that's like a pretty clean line and I
[36:15] don't know what it's like in Austria but
[36:17] you look in Canada there's some pretty
[36:19] massive Lobby
[36:20] budgets where you know which if replaced
[36:23] with marketing budget or discount or
[36:25] return to shareholder would provide a
[36:27] lot more value to a lot more
[36:29] people I think in a lot of sense Austria
[36:33] is a home of
[36:34] [Laughter]
[36:36] corruption yeah we we we we uh we didn't
[36:39] had a scandal this year but the last
[36:42] three years we we we we had every year
[36:45] big Scandal what's uh like what's a
[36:47] recent Scandal um I mean the the most
[36:52] entertaining one is probably where uh
[36:56] the vice Chancellor was in IIT and uh
[37:01] some guys built a trap for him and they
[37:04] made him believe that he was talking to
[37:06] like a real Rich Russian guy uh
[37:10] and and then he really talked about we
[37:14] will buy that newspaper then we can do
[37:16] that and like he he really talked like
[37:19] it is an Incredible video to watch it
[37:21] it's like one hour long or something
[37:23] like that or longer than that maybe four
[37:25] hours or something like that uh and
[37:27] basically
[37:28] you get a drunken uh under truck
[37:32] politician talking about all the things
[37:34] that we are scared of that politicians
[37:36] actually do buying newspapers with
[37:38] Russian money and stuff like that and he
[37:40] was the vice Chancellor at the time in E
[37:44] drunken under drugs and filmed with a
[37:47] crew H and it was was it was staged by
[37:50] some newspaper or something like that uh
[37:52] and this was the I think the biggest uh
[37:56] Scandal uh
[37:58] that came out in 20 when was that that
[38:01] that's been a long time two years ago
[38:04] three years ago something like that uh
[38:06] and then and then the the chancellor
[38:09] that was with him had a scandal one year
[38:12] later about something completely
[38:14] different which was actually true like
[38:17] uh the vice Chancellor just talked about
[38:19] it and then the chancellor went ahead
[38:22] and actually did this things oh he did
[38:25] the things that the vice CH was talking
[38:26] about no no no not the exact things but
[38:29] the systematic things were were the same
[38:31] thing so like I don't know how it maybe
[38:34] maybe I don't know about all the things
[38:36] going on in the world but Austria has a
[38:39] history of corruption that's for sure
[38:41] that's crazy man yeah it's it's um it's
[38:44] shocking to me and we we we have similar
[38:46] stories in Canada obviously they've got
[38:48] them in the states uh it and it blows my
[38:52] mind that we still just accept it and
[38:55] there's no there's no reper cussions
[38:58] like our our guy is going to you know
[39:00] get the boot get completely eviscerated
[39:03] in the next election and he's going to
[39:05] retire on an incredible pension all from
[39:08] taxpayer money and it is just so sad the
[39:12] misaligned incentives in this Fiat
[39:14] standard bureaucratic political world
[39:17] are so bad and so sad and you know
[39:21] Bitcoin is a piece of the fix um but
[39:24] honestly it's an entire Awakening of the
[39:26] society that we have to get to that's
[39:28] going to actually fix it there are no
[39:30] consequences that that that's that's
[39:32] that's a weird thing uh the chancellor
[39:34] that did that uh he he not worked Works
[39:37] in America he has a new Consulting
[39:40] agency made Millions every year I mean
[39:44] it's private uh it's in the private
[39:46] sector it's it's it's fine I guess it's
[39:49] not from taxpayers uh but but still
[39:51] there's like no real consequences to to
[39:54] all those things that politicians do
[39:55] that that that's I think that's the real
[39:57] that that people don't like about it uh
[40:00] that they do that and then there are not
[40:02] consequences and usually there are
[40:04] consequences if you do bad things
[40:06] because yeah every like every group of
[40:09] people does bad things like every uh
[40:12] there are podcast host that's did really
[40:14] bad things there are like from every
[40:16] group of career genres there are people
[40:19] that did really bad things but there are
[40:21] consequences too and I feel like there's
[40:23] like an elite group of politicians that
[40:25] are excluded from that and and if that's
[40:27] the that's a weird rigged thing well if
[40:30] like you know podcast host like if you
[40:32] if you do a really bad thing you know
[40:33] you probably let some people down um
[40:36] there's some people that probably look
[40:37] up to you and that listen to you and um
[40:40] you know all that stuff um and you let
[40:42] them down but there's no real harm uh
[40:45] there's there's a let down there should
[40:46] be a questioning of okay well what else
[40:48] did did Robin say that maybe I should
[40:51] question given he was doing this behind
[40:52] the scenes and all that but if we're on
[40:54] a first principles approach Society if
[40:56] we actually think about the way that if
[41:00] we if we took you know everything we
[41:02] hear back to ourselves and thought with
[41:04] my core values with my beliefs and with
[41:06] my uh thoughts what do I think about
[41:09] this you know do I agree or disagree and
[41:12] why then it's it's a nonissue it's like
[41:15] you know you don't actually need Heroes
[41:16] you don't actually need to have you know
[41:19] these these big famous people um that
[41:21] have all this influence because
[41:23] everything is a decentralized thought
[41:25] process and you know we will all have
[41:27] General consensus around you know the
[41:29] large hot button issues um but we don't
[41:32] need some figurehead to be a
[41:34] spokesperson for you know what it is
[41:37] that we want in the world and I think
[41:40] that you know when we every time you see
[41:43] a scandal and it's headlines and it's
[41:46] all problems it's evidence of
[41:48] centralization and that you know that
[41:50] has varying levels of harm but
[41:52] centralization just leads to corruption
[41:55] it's kind of the it's kind of the path
[41:58] it's super interesting uh we talk about
[42:01] now this Bitcoin system that we coming
[42:03] and we already living kind of in this
[42:05] super cycle of of Bitcoin 15 years it's
[42:08] astonishing how far we already got um is
[42:12] is there chance in your mind where you
[42:14] see Bitcoin is kind of successful in
[42:16] terms of like it grows huge amount of of
[42:20] value and and a really dominant space in
[42:22] in our our ecosystem but it's still just
[42:25] another tool like gold is right now gold
[42:27] is still huge um uh you can take self
[42:31] custody of gold you can put in the bank
[42:32] you can do all all those things uh I
[42:34] don't know if anywhere in the world gold
[42:36] is band I'm not aware of that at
[42:39] least that's what that was it it it was
[42:42] at one point in uh in America it was
[42:44] illegal to own gold um in uh in
[42:49] 1913 uh it's called this executive order
[42:51] 6102 have you ever heard of this yeah
[42:54] yeah but but I was just wondering if
[42:56] it's the right now anywhere B no
[42:59] no who who's I think even sailor talked
[43:03] about that like if if you owned gold in
[43:05] the last 100 years no matter where you
[43:07] were on on Earth at some point it got
[43:10] confiscated like it it got confiscated
[43:13] almost every everywhere I heard that
[43:15] somewhere maybe I'm wrong about that but
[43:17] there's only a few places probably that
[43:19] didn't got confiscated but the point I
[43:21] was uh going towards is like um is there
[43:26] a chance that that maybe Bitcoin is just
[43:29] another tool set in in in a larger
[43:31] system and maybe keeps the Fiat system
[43:34] more accountable but the feat system is
[43:37] still around and especially now with all
[43:39] the ETFs most people have on Exchange at
[43:41] self custodies is a niche thing within
[43:44] Bitcoin do do you see that maybe also
[43:47] being a possibility I think that it can
[43:49] definitely help keep the Fiat system
[43:51] honest um but I think that the more and
[43:55] more that we move towards Bitcoin in a
[43:59] hyper bitcoinz world the bigger Bitcoin
[44:02] gets the Fiat system looks less and less
[44:05] and less attractive and I think that the
[44:07] invention of Bitcoin is probably that um
[44:11] you know in like 55 maybe a hundred
[44:15] years maybe 200 years we'll look back on
[44:19] January 3rd 2009 and be like that was
[44:22] when everything changed and um you know
[44:26] this is the reason we don't have you
[44:28] know bloated stock markets with with big
[44:31] giant you know corporations anymore um I
[44:35] think there will still be there will
[44:37] still be
[44:38] General activity General business
[44:41] investing activity but I don't know that
[44:44] it will be used as a way to safeguard
[44:46] wealth because we'll have a protocol
[44:49] built in to safeguard wealth like you
[44:51] know a Reit like a real estate you know
[44:55] portfolio makes no sense on a Bitcoin
[44:57] standard because houses are just you
[45:00] know like no one very very very very few
[45:03] people anyways have a you know a car
[45:06] investment uh trust because it doesn't
[45:09] make any sense because cars are
[45:10] depreciating assets houses become
[45:12] depreciating assets on a Bitcoin
[45:14] standard I think that um you know to
[45:17] outpace bitcoin an ETF has to be very
[45:20] very very productive and a very very
[45:23] very good guesser on what the next big
[45:26] thing going to be um and I think the
[45:28] opportunity
[45:29] cost in that way will be I think it'll
[45:34] kind of flip it'll be as great as
[45:35] holding dollars is today no one's dumb
[45:37] enough to save in dollars right now that
[45:39] would be so stupid to be like all right
[45:41] I got my money under my mattress I'm
[45:42] good to go for 50 years like my kids are
[45:45] gonna be so thankful for this you know
[45:47] 150 Grand I've got for them like no one
[45:49] no one's that stupid in this day and age
[45:52] um I think owning the assets that we
[45:55] deem to be like safe you know good
[45:58] Investments right now will look like
[46:00] that in whatever some unknown period of
[46:04] time half a century a Century Two
[46:06] centuries I don't know what it will be
[46:09] that's super interesting um it's also
[46:11] the the question of uh zombie company is
[46:15] really interesting as you mentioned the
[46:17] bloed companies I looked it up today uh
[46:20] actually um I can pull it up later it's
[46:22] it's funny uh I looked Bitcoin versus
[46:26] gold and Bitcoin versus Real Estate in
[46:27] The Last 5 Years and Bitcoin 10x the
[46:31] performance of of both of them so like
[46:33] gold went down
[46:35] 94% and Bitcoin went down 9 1% and even
[46:40] companies uh I think the only one that
[46:43] is sticking out on on a fiveyear chart
[46:45] is Tesla that has like 10% more of
[46:48] performance something like that there's
[46:49] like there's only a very small amount of
[46:52] companies that can outperform it and
[46:54] that's what I mean like it just the
[46:55] opportunity cost is so great to doing
[46:58] anything that's not and so what you
[47:00] become is you become um you become a
[47:02] mission focused investor which is good
[47:04] like you it investing almost becomes
[47:07] philanthropic and I think that we we
[47:09] then blend the world of um like like you
[47:14] know we're on a mission to enable
[47:15] Independence we're publicly traded you
[47:16] know you could buy our stock and the
[47:18] reason you'd want to buy our stock is
[47:20] you know there there will be times when
[47:22] we outpace Bitcoin we're outpacing
[47:24] Bitcoin so far this year um you know if
[47:26] we close that way we probably still will
[47:29] um but that's only on on a one-year time
[47:31] frame but more than that you want to you
[47:34] know own Bitcoin well stock because you
[47:36] believe in our mission to enable
[47:38] Independence because you want to support
[47:40] our mission you want to play a piece in
[47:41] that mission you want to know that um
[47:44] you know when you stack SATs at Bitcoin
[47:46] well you're also a shareholder you know
[47:49] you're part of that whole ecosystem and
[47:52] obviously we hope to make a couple bucks
[47:55] but more than that you know on a Bitcoin
[47:57] standard investing looks a lot more
[48:00] philanthropic and holistic which means
[48:04] again correct incentives I as a CEO have
[48:07] a lot higher level of responsibility
[48:10] right I can't have any scandals because
[48:12] you know people will actually care right
[48:15] like it's not like oh well that guy's
[48:16] super bad but he's making me Rich so
[48:19] it's all you know I'll just go ahead and
[48:20] turn a blind eye it's like hey I've
[48:23] actually got other options now I can go
[48:25] and just store Bitcoin I am here because
[48:27] I want to be not because my dollar is
[48:29] eroding at such an incredible rate that
[48:31] I need to be and that's a power it's
[48:33] just more decentralization more power to
[48:35] the
[48:36] people it's also interesting to think
[48:38] about what uh Bitcoin will do to
[48:41] companies and and and and you run one
[48:44] company uh and you already have Bitcoin
[48:47] as your hurdle rate because you probably
[48:48] have like okay I can either buy with
[48:52] let's say there's coming a $50,000
[48:55] incoming um I can I to pay buy myself
[48:59] now Bitcoin with that I can put it on a
[49:01] marketing campaign I can do whatever
[49:03] with the money how do you manage that
[49:06] between like do just buy Bitcoin or do a
[49:09] spending on the business uh and how will
[49:12] that change companies if their hurdle
[49:15] rate is not or we're losing 5 10% of
[49:18] purchasing power every year but we
[49:20] actually gaining purchasing power if you
[49:22] just stick to a Bitcoin standard how
[49:25] will that change the philosophy and the
[49:28] the the mindset in
[49:29] companies yeah I think I think it will
[49:32] um I think that the risk tolerances go
[49:34] down which means the smartest people
[49:37] will have to work harder and we're going
[49:39] to have more um you're going to need to
[49:43] have more certainty of success to move
[49:46] forward um in my mind I think it looks
[49:49] like working a lot harder it looks like
[49:52] right now it's very easy to increase
[49:54] your purchasing power because the dollar
[49:56] does that for you automatically right
[49:59] buy anything else in the world and your
[50:01] purchasing power will likely go up and
[50:04] so um it it we don't have to work very
[50:07] hard we have to be lazy you have to take
[50:09] a couple days off you don't have to you
[50:11] can be wrong a bunch you know you can't
[50:13] if you're right a couple times in your
[50:14] career you're G to be rich like this is
[50:16] kind of the world that we live in now um
[50:20] and on a Bitcoin standard it's not that
[50:22] easy you have to work pretty hard you
[50:24] have to you know take big swings and be
[50:26] very very certain that you will hit them
[50:29] um you need to be you know pushing the
[50:32] envelope and and and you know on the
[50:34] bleeding edge of innovation in order to
[50:37] to outpace bitcoin um and that's good I
[50:41] think that we're going to see a lot of
[50:44] like during this transition period we're
[50:46] going to see a lot of companies and
[50:47] businesses that were wor prominent fail
[50:49] because they've lost that bleeding edge
[50:51] and then we're going to see a complete
[50:54] Resurgence of just brilliant individuals
[50:57] creating maximum value for the world
[51:00] because they will be the ones that
[51:02] actually have a shot you know when we
[51:03] were going public we had like we we were
[51:06] we were a real business we weren't just
[51:08] some you know Pie in the Sky uh Vision
[51:12] we were an actual operating company
[51:14] bringing in you know tens of millions of
[51:16] dollars of Revenue per year and that
[51:19] hurt us because uh in the micro cap
[51:22] space which is where we live we're like
[51:23] a tiny you know $40 million company um
[51:27] investors want to see like moonshot they
[51:30] they don't you know they're not
[51:31] interested in in a few million dollars
[51:34] of Revenue um they want to see no
[51:37] revenue and maximum build which is just
[51:39] such a reverse again the incentives are
[51:41] just wrong it's it's it's perverse and
[51:45] the second you talk about Revenue you
[51:47] will be valued like a company that
[51:49] builds Revenue but if you don't talk
[51:51] about Revenue at all and only talk about
[51:52] the future then you get clumped into
[51:54] this category of dreamers you get
[51:55] clumped into this this group I heard I
[51:57] saw this hilarious tweet it it it was a
[51:59] fake tweet but he was talking about San
[52:02] Francisco or about um um like PA Alto in
[52:05] um like Silicon Valley and he's like
[52:07] just met with a guy uh who raised 10
[52:10] million bucks for a startup burnt nine
[52:12] and a half um on the team in a cool
[52:15] office pivoted to Ai and then just
[52:17] raised 50 million bucks we're so back
[52:20] it's like that is the epitome of the
[52:22] Fiat world right there like I had a
[52:25] business shipped nothing burnt all the
[52:28] cash changed the story and raised five
[52:31] times more and that will just evaporate
[52:34] on a Bitcoin standard you won't be able
[52:36] to do that anymore uh which is a which
[52:38] is a good thing it probably means the
[52:39] world slows down a little bit which
[52:41] again is a good thing it probably means
[52:43] we get off this treadmill this hamster
[52:46] wheel of a race to against Fiat and
[52:48] that's a good thing so I think
[52:50] businesses go through a rocky period but
[52:52] strong Will Survive and if you're a
[52:54] high- performing individual you'll be
[52:56] just
[52:56] fine and uh we live in this interesting
[53:00] moment where we have Bitcoin companies
[53:02] playing the field games uh to enhance
[53:05] the Bitcoin stack I guess Bitcoin well
[53:08] also does that you're publicly traded
[53:09] you you you can play feat games uh like
[53:13] uh micro strategy oh man and it's such a
[53:16] it's such a double-edged sword for me I
[53:18] so yeah so we like we actually just
[53:20] launched a product similar to micro
[53:23] strategy um where I I've been so like
[53:26] the whole history here is quite
[53:27] interesting from my perspective I've
[53:28] been quite anti-
[53:30] mstr um I've got a very like you know
[53:33] it's not real Bitcoin it's not as good
[53:35] as Bitcoin uh you know number go up is
[53:37] fine but it's not freedom and um you
[53:42] know going through that whilst kind of
[53:45] also running a public traded company I
[53:47] also have a you know I have a amount
[53:49] amount of responsibility for my
[53:51] shareholders and for what for what we do
[53:54] and so we did we're doing something
[53:57] similar it's a little bit different but
[53:58] we're issuing a we've issued a debt
[54:01] product that converts into equity and
[54:03] that pays interest in equity and so I've
[54:06] Justified it in my head rightly or
[54:08] wrongly in such a way that it's
[54:10] basically just a cheaper Equity raise
[54:13] and um it's kind of like I do see it as
[54:19] um a net positive for the shareholder
[54:24] for our company certainly um
[54:26] as far as whether or not it's a net
[54:29] positive for the earth I believe that
[54:31] Bitcoin well you know our mission is
[54:33] very important and I believe strongly in
[54:35] our mission and so I do think that we'll
[54:37] you know we'll take the capital and
[54:38] we'll we'll invest it properly and we'll
[54:40] build the right platforms that help
[54:42] people you know enable their
[54:43] independence and all this stuff and so
[54:45] it's justified in my head um but it is a
[54:48] wrestling game similar to my my
[54:50] politician Vibes right of like uh okay
[54:53] should I Vote or should I not vote are
[54:55] they good or you know they help me or
[54:57] should I just stick my head in the sand
[54:58] like it's kind of that same back and
[55:00] forth in my head of um you know what is
[55:03] our role here and we're already part of
[55:06] the Fiat game we're on the you know
[55:07] we're on the stock exchange we're
[55:09] already we're already here not doing it
[55:13] felt wrong um even though you know I
[55:16] kind of had these these negative
[55:18] thoughts earlier it's inter but you
[55:22] don't just uh issue a debt product byy
[55:25] Bitcoin with it hold it on like you you
[55:27] actually as you said you want to invest
[55:29] in the platform and you want to build
[55:31] something with the Bitcoin well yeah so
[55:33] we're going to like the proceeds so this
[55:36] first one is small it's a couple million
[55:37] bucks and we're gonna you know we're
[55:40] going to just evaluate how that cash is
[55:42] best used and back to your point on a
[55:44] Bitcoin standard like we've got you know
[55:46] we know it's about 60% if you can't out
[55:49] pay 60% then we shouldn't probably
[55:51] Venture on that road and so you know
[55:53] we'll get some cash and we know that we
[55:55] want to build some things and Market
[55:56] some things and talk to our customers
[55:59] and you know definitely not Lobby I I do
[56:02] not want it'll be zero doll Lobby spent
[56:06] and then whatever's left over and
[56:08] that'll go through a rigorous filter of
[56:09] does this enable Independence and can we
[56:11] outpace Bitcoin and then you know the
[56:14] rest will be used to to purchase Bitcoin
[56:16] we have a little bit of Bitcoin on the
[56:17] balance sheet right now so we're you
[56:19] know kind of in this in this way and you
[56:22] know that's kind of the the future of
[56:23] the company I think I think this is a
[56:25] good
[56:26] intermediate kind of term how the Fiat
[56:29] markets get used and msgi is an
[56:32] interesting f for me also because I've
[56:35] seen it as a distraction like obviously
[56:38] it's a great growth story and if you
[56:41] have for example money locked up in a
[56:43] 41k or pension fund where you just
[56:45] cannot get it out uh it might be a
[56:47] really good play uh and it has probably
[56:50] a similar risk portfolio than a Bitcoin
[56:53] ETF and you get more upset to that uh
[56:56] outside of that I just like Bitcoin in
[56:58] self custody and I don't own any msdr
[57:01] stocks because of that reason because I
[57:03] don't have money locked up anywhere um
[57:06] but I feel like it's an distraction from
[57:10] Bitcoin away from self custody in a
[57:13] similar way than in previous Cycles
[57:16] Bitcoin got distracted by altcoins
[57:19] because of more gains yeah yeah number
[57:22] to go up has a dark side man it's um
[57:25] number go up is an important part of
[57:29] money and purchasing power um but there
[57:33] are more important things than the
[57:38] biggest number and I feel like as a
[57:40] society we are all addicted to the
[57:42] biggest number um if you made 500% but
[57:46] you missed out on a thousand you're mad
[57:48] you're frustrated how could I have done
[57:50] that to myself I've ruined my life you
[57:52] know this is I'm upset I'm angry and
[57:55] that's the wrong way to look I think
[57:57] that we want to understand that owning
[58:00] Bitcoin
[58:02] um is not going to be the fastest horse
[58:06] anymore but it is the safest horse the
[58:09] fastest horse is at the casino always
[58:11] and you're gonna have opportunities to
[58:13] go to the to go to the gambling area all
[58:15] the time but no one's naive enough to
[58:17] think that that's a a sound way to save
[58:20] money or to invest you know imagine
[58:22] walking into the casino and going invest
[58:24] calling it investing like it's just dumb
[58:27] and um you know when you trade your
[58:30] Bitcoin for like you said the altcoins
[58:33] or the nfts or you know before that it
[58:36] was the
[58:37] icos like it just you get wrecked and
[58:41] typically what starts the cycle is also
[58:44] what finishes it you look back to 2013
[58:47] why was that driven well we hit dollar
[58:49] parody Mount goau fired up and then
[58:52] Mount goau rugged and everything crashed
[58:55] and then 2017
[58:56] we had icos kicking things off people
[58:58] were entering into the market through
[59:00] Bitcoin and then through eth and then
[59:02] what happened Ico got regulated and
[59:05] they' started rugging people boom
[59:07] crashed the market 2021 we have like you
[59:11] say the alts and the nfts and the meme
[59:14] coins and what happened FTX the like the
[59:19] the you know the poster child of memes
[59:21] and and and nfts and and you know Meme
[59:25] coins
[59:26] they rug out it goes and so what boot
[59:29] what kickstarted this one was
[59:32] politicians and Michael sailor um so
[59:35] does history repeat I mean time will
[59:37] tell I certainly hope not you know maybe
[59:40] this is the the split maybe this is
[59:42] where we get we get a better option and
[59:44] you know we're learning from our Stakes
[59:47] um and I certainly think that could be a
[59:49] case but I do know that there's a lot of
[59:53] um what's single points of failure in
[59:56] with you know coinbase and the ETFs and
[59:59] where those coins are stored and I think
[60:01] there could be some problems here you
[60:02] know you look at na bu Kelly recently
[60:05] like you know the IMF is throwing some
[60:07] carrots at him billion dollar carrots
[60:09] and you know there's just there's some
[60:12] Rumblings underneath here bubbling up
[60:14] that maybe we're kind of like ah what's
[60:15] gonna happen
[60:17] here and uh I mean even Michael Z
[60:20] himself says byy Bitcoin I think uh I
[60:23] heard an interview like it's better
[60:26] Bitcoin then msdr something something
[60:27] along those lines and I like that
[60:30] fastest horse with the casino and my
[60:33] thought came up like Bitcoin is kind of
[60:35] the fastest horse for Freedom G up
[60:37] technology like if you want to have
[60:39] freedom that's the fastest horse if you
[60:42] just want to have um a high number on
[60:45] some imaginary bank account yeah like
[60:48] there might beit better things so that
[60:50] the P the IMF thing is interesting um
[60:55] what I understood is they said hey if
[60:59] you don't force the merchants to uh
[61:03] adopt Bitcoin as a payment method then
[61:06] you get that thing is is is that what
[61:09] happened that's that's bang on from my
[61:11] understanding as well um I think that in
[61:14] of itself is actually a positive thing
[61:15] actually I think today probably a video
[61:17] went out that we filmed on this exact
[61:18] topic because
[61:21] um I do believe that Merchants should
[61:23] not be forced to accept Bitcoin I think
[61:25] that's a great move
[61:27] but you know there's one of two ways to
[61:29] look at this here and time will tell
[61:31] which way it was was na buelli playing
[61:35] chess and you know kind of doing more
[61:38] than he wanted to do because let's be
[61:40] let's be honest he didn't really enforce
[61:41] that rule right there was never uh there
[61:44] was no there was no Governors walking
[61:46] around with sticks secret shopping the
[61:48] Bitcoin Merchants it was very Loosely um
[61:52] Loosely like regarded and so was he
[61:55] playing and making it legal not really
[61:58] enforcing it and then now he gets a
[62:00] billion dollars and the thing he didn't
[62:01] really used to enforce just kind of goes
[62:04] away that's fine right that's great or
[62:08] is the IMF playing chess here and are
[62:10] they saying hey let's just pick at this
[62:12] Bitcoin thing bit by bit we'll give you
[62:14] a billion if you make it not Mand not
[62:17] mandatory but we'll give you three
[62:19] billion if you make it illegal and then
[62:22] you've got all this Bitcoin in your
[62:23] balance sheet well why don't you sell
[62:25] that and we'll give you 10 billion um
[62:28] there's like there there's little tiny
[62:29] cracks in the foundation and I think
[62:31] that again these you know these places
[62:34] are you know they're either you either
[62:36] think they're
[62:37] incompetent and this is why we're here
[62:39] or you think they're evil and they're
[62:40] very smart and this is why we're here
[62:42] and I probably fall on different sides
[62:44] of the track at different times um but
[62:47] if I wanted to make countries less
[62:49] Sovereign I would certainly give them
[62:52] bits of money that I completely control
[62:55] uh uh in order to make them do what I
[62:57] want and I think that Buell is getting a
[62:59] little bit of this taste of something
[63:01] that he's never had before all of the
[63:04] sudden he has leverage and it's
[63:05] interesting how we will do it with that
[63:09] and yeah I was in a
[63:11] Salvador yeah not even a month ago yeah
[63:14] actually that's where that's where we
[63:16] met I think if I'm recalling correctly
[63:18] now yeah yeah I said Nico on the news
[63:20] desk uh he brought me up and and and and
[63:23] then there we met yeah that that was uh
[63:26] great yeah um but but yeah I was in a
[63:29] salador and I walked around and I was at
[63:32] three or four stores because I didn't
[63:34] had a lot of time outside of the Bitcoin
[63:36] conferences because there lot happening
[63:39] uh in that week uh that weren't on the
[63:42] Bitcoin conference side and none of them
[63:45] had Bitcoin payment methods I picked the
[63:48] four uh wrong ones so when this news
[63:51] broke I was like they didn't force like
[63:54] nobody forced emerence like obviously
[63:57] they didn't even knew about it that was
[63:59] one interesting thing I was in s
[64:01] Salvador on the volcano up uh and you
[64:04] have to pay $2 of entry fee there and uh
[64:08] you have to pay in cash $2 they didn't
[64:11] take credit cards and didn't dig Bitcoin
[64:13] and I didn't have cash with me and they
[64:16] like oh yeah you can go in like no no
[64:18] worries you get it for free today uh and
[64:20] I was like hey can I still give you
[64:22] Bitcoin like I I have my Bitcoin wallet
[64:24] I would love to give you Bitcoin and
[64:26] they like no like you already let me in
[64:28] for free I would just give you free bit
[64:31] free Bitcoin yeah so like it definitely
[64:33] is not uh uh forced by any means no no I
[64:37] I had a similar experience I actually so
[64:39] I did I paid at Walmart um with uh with
[64:43] Bitcoin which was pretty cool and then
[64:44] bought some Starbucks with Bitcoin um
[64:47] also got turned away a couple times I
[64:48] have I don't speak Spanish so I had a or
[64:50] I speak very little Spanish I had a
[64:51] language barrier a little bit um which
[64:53] probably made it difficult but I think
[64:55] at the end of the day from what I
[64:56] understand there like it was very
[64:58] centralized the roll out the Cho app is
[65:00] government subsidized um there's very
[65:03] low trust for the Bitcoin apps and so
[65:07] the citizens generally kind of don't
[65:09] really enjoy it um but I think that
[65:14] making it yeah making it mandat or
[65:16] making it not mandatory is probably a
[65:18] positive thing um like I said I just I
[65:21] want to know who's playing who in chess
[65:23] because there is a world where buelli
[65:26] had this planned all along and just
[65:27] wanted leverage to you know that's a
[65:30] very basic negotiating tactic right just
[65:32] throw something else that you want so
[65:33] you can easily take it away you know to
[65:36] appease the other side um but I think
[65:39] the IMF now is like oh hey he's movable
[65:42] like we let's see how far we can push
[65:44] this and at the end of the day you know
[65:46] can is there is there enough money to
[65:49] make buelli you know make it illegal go
[65:52] off the Bitcoin standard um you know
[65:55] whatever it might be um maybe and who
[65:59] knows it's hard to say absolutely that's
[66:02] also it's always the answer I give
[66:04] because people I was in El salador and
[66:06] naturally people asked you if you moved
[66:08] there for some reason and I always
[66:10] answer
[66:11] like this experiment with elab hasn't
[66:15] gone on for long enough for me like I'm
[66:18] kind of rud kind of I'm not like moving
[66:20] too quick I want to build rout somewhere
[66:22] and I feel really good right now in
[66:24] Austria and I have a lot of Hope for the
[66:25] European politicians also actually um
[66:28] but obviously there are better countries
[66:31] in Austria Pol politics wise but I have
[66:34] to see something sustainable if I see it
[66:37] in the next like five 10 years if in 10
[66:39] years like the direction just goes in
[66:41] that direction probably have to buy a
[66:43] higher property uh price for that but uh
[66:47] I I want to see something long term and
[66:49] that that's where I get with that and I
[66:52] the most amazing thing that I took away
[66:54] from El Salvador was I was the M
[66:56] premiera Bitcoin graduation and there uh
[67:01] the founder who how is he called I
[67:02] forgot his name John yeah John uh he
[67:06] said this he they're working on not only
[67:09] on educating the students but now also
[67:12] on 400 teachers they're educating them
[67:14] on bitcoin so they uh can educate the
[67:18] students all over the country and
[67:20] they're building a Bitcoin Department
[67:22] within the education department of El
[67:24] Salvador so I think that's the way more
[67:26] bullish news for that because yes they
[67:30] they can buy Bitcoin but I don't care if
[67:31] a country has Bitcoin honestly like I I
[67:33] would rather like I think Germany
[67:36] selling Bitcoin is better than America
[67:38] buying them I don't want countries to
[67:40] have Bitcoin uh but that's a whole
[67:43] another story so I think the the pushing
[67:45] to watch education is amazing yeah no I
[67:48] totally agree man I think it's fantastic
[67:50] I think that the experiment's been good
[67:52] I think too um we can kind of see in
[67:56] real time what it does for a nation you
[67:59] can just feel I don't know if you felt
[68:00] this but I could feel the optimism in El
[68:03] Salvador there was just building
[68:04] projects going on the streets felt safe
[68:07] like it felt it felt very very good and
[68:09] it's more than just Bitcoin that does
[68:11] that but it was you can definitely feel
[68:14] a positivity in the air um over in that
[68:17] country absolutely really cool uh one
[68:20] last question before we come to to the
[68:22] final two questions of the ending of the
[68:24] podcast um we talked about Bitcoin the
[68:27] Bitcoin isation how how how this looks
[68:30] um with all those positive news coming
[68:32] out and this bull cycle now and at the
[68:34] Christmas table probably Bitcoin will be
[68:36] a discussion Point how close do you feel
[68:41] we are in kind of like percentage wise
[68:43] to this H Bitcoin isation to like a real
[68:46] uh suddenly face uh moment of of of
[68:49] Bitcoin it's a good question I I I don't
[68:51] know that I have a fully formed opinion
[68:53] on this um I think that that we are
[68:56] probably entering into over the next
[68:57] five years everyone is going to have
[69:00] some exposure to bitcoin directly or
[69:03] indirectly um but I wouldn't necessarily
[69:05] call that hyperbitcoinization um I think
[69:08] hyperbitcoinization
[69:09] probably needs one maybe even two
[69:12] generations to happen um I don't think
[69:16] the old crusty suits in the Starbucks
[69:18] boardroom are going to do a sweeping
[69:20] Bitcoin accepted here policy I don't
[69:23] think we're going to see massive
[69:24] Corporation Who currently spend billions
[69:27] lobbying governments switch that into
[69:30] owning Bitcoin I think we need to see
[69:33] you know the generation of my children
[69:34] growing up like my kids grow up they
[69:36] will never have a bank account ever they
[69:38] have Bitcoin wallets since the day they
[69:39] were born and um you know by the time
[69:42] they're old enough to be able to you
[69:44] know to have to spend money in the Fiat
[69:45] World um they will just be able to use a
[69:47] Bitcoin well account the Bitcoin well
[69:49] card and they you know Bitcoin well will
[69:51] will be their Bridge into the Fiat World
[69:53] along with millions of other people at
[69:55] that time
[69:56] and so I have very very high hopes that
[70:00] that generation which will then be
[70:02] taking over as the next you know leaders
[70:05] of the corporations will be you know
[70:08] nixing or partially nixing the lobby you
[70:11] know budgets and the the ridiculous you
[70:14] know bureaucratic nonsense in favor of
[70:16] Bitcoin so I would probably say we're
[70:18] one generation away from really starting
[70:21] to see but like man like on my
[70:23] babysitter not my babysitter my kids
[70:25] babysitter we pay her in in in Bitcoin
[70:29] and it's it's automatic for her like it
[70:31] took no explaining she just got it get
[70:33] the app you know here we go it's all
[70:36] enlightening it's custodial and then now
[70:38] we're TR to talk about self- custody and
[70:40] she's got you know she's got like you
[70:43] know like seven figures of SATs like
[70:45] she's got like a million SATs which is
[70:47] you know in Canada terms about 1,500
[70:50] bucks like it's not life-changing money
[70:52] by any's imagination but it she's
[70:54] watched It Grow she's convinced she's
[70:56] been reading about it she's talking to
[70:57] her friends at school about it um and
[71:00] this is this is kind of how the process
[71:02] starts and so you know as she graduates
[71:04] and as she gets into the workforce and
[71:06] as she's saving her money and as she's
[71:07] having kids you know she'll be like
[71:10] bringing apart this Bitcoin knowledge so
[71:13] I think it's I think it's the ways away
[71:15] on the macro but I think there'll be
[71:18] there's lots of steps between now and
[71:20] then and I think that's going to
[71:21] continue very quickly I love that orange
[71:24] brilling one person at a time uh and
[71:27] coming closer to the Hy conversation we
[71:29] have one question that I asked each and
[71:31] every one of my guests uh and that is
[71:34] what can we learn from you besides
[71:36] Bitcoin I think um it would probably be
[71:39] in the like humbleness spirituality you
[71:43] know like I give a presentation called
[71:44] Jesus is a bitcoiner and it's this
[71:46] thesis this ethos that your Bitcoin
[71:49] Journey leads you from you know a pre-
[71:51] coiner in my presentation I say a pre-
[71:53] Bitcoin maximalist to to a britcoin to a
[71:56] Bitcoin maximalist to a follower of
[71:58] Jesus and if you walk
[72:00] through um you know the point
[72:03] of us humans it's so much more than just
[72:08] you know stack SATs I think it's summed
[72:09] up pretty nicely as stay humble stack
[72:12] SATs and that's a really big concept
[72:14] throughout Jesus's life and so I would
[72:16] say that's probably you know it I
[72:18] encourage everybody to investigate um
[72:22] their relationship with Jesus and andan
[72:24] people I don't believe in that it's like
[72:26] well fine that's a relationship and I
[72:28] invite you to investigate that um you
[72:30] know even a decision not to is a
[72:33] decision and uh and so I encourage
[72:36] everyone to to you know think about this
[72:39] logically think about your time
[72:40] preference you know on the lowest lowest
[72:43] time preference you need to think about
[72:45] you know what's after Earth what and if
[72:48] and maybe you think it's dust and that's
[72:50] fine and I would debate that with you
[72:51] happily um but it's probably not and so
[72:54] if it's not now we're into the meat of
[72:57] well you know what is it and that's uh
[73:00] that that's a fun journey to be on
[73:02] that's that that that is for sure and I
[73:05] I totally subscribe to that idea that
[73:07] non-decision is also a decision
[73:09] especially if it comes to investing a
[73:11] lot of people in Austria I don't know if
[73:12] it's the same in Canada in the US I
[73:15] believe if you leave your uh money on
[73:19] the bank it's a non-decision like I
[73:21] don't want to take the decision where to
[73:23] invest my money no you took the decision
[73:25] to invest exactly exactly and that's uh
[73:29] you know it's like it's too risky you
[73:31] know I didn't I didn't want to make the
[73:33] call it's like sorry that's not how life
[73:35] works it's the physics of life where you
[73:36] just make
[73:38] decisions and
[73:39] even yeah you have to make the decision
[73:43] perfect then we come to the end routine
[73:44] of the podcast where the previous guest
[73:45] is asking a question for the next guest
[73:47] without knowing who the next guest is
[73:49] and your question from the previous
[73:50] guest is how do you see the future of
[73:53] Pension funds wow I so I probably see
[73:56] them as on the on the long term
[73:59] diminishing um you know just again
[74:03] Pension funds are designed because you
[74:05] and I are too dumb to manage our own
[74:07] money and you know we need some ability
[74:10] to have uh someone smarter than us do it
[74:14] over our entire career so we at least
[74:16] have a shot at retirement this is kind
[74:17] of the the ethos of of Pension funds on
[74:21] a Bitcoin standard it gets incredibly
[74:23] easy to save money especially from a
[74:25] young age but I don't think it'll
[74:26] disappear overnight I think we're still
[74:28] have you know 25 years of like good
[74:32] solid pension fund performance however
[74:35] there will be a time undoubtedly 100%
[74:38] Mark the clip remindme tweets whatever
[74:40] the whatever the the reminders are
[74:43] Pension funds will be rugging their
[74:46] investors In Our Lifetime uh no
[74:49] questions asked the the Fiat bubble is
[74:51] bursting and Pension funds will be one
[74:53] of the consequences of that the money
[74:56] either won't be there they'll have to be
[74:57] bailed out um or it will turn out that
[75:00] their assets they were holding were
[75:02] improperly secured or what have you um
[75:05] but Pension funds I think over the long
[75:07] term don't exist on the short term they
[75:09] still exist but be careful because they
[75:11] might rug you do you have the uh choice
[75:15] to invest in them or not in in Canada or
[75:17] can you get your money out uh yeah so
[75:21] we yeah we do have a choice I don't
[75:23] think I contribute to anything we do so
[75:25] in Canada as if you're an employee you
[75:28] pay a CPP tax a Canadian pension plan
[75:31] tax I call it a tax it's a contribution
[75:33] they call it I think um officially and
[75:36] but as someone that owns like I've only
[75:38] ever worked you know I worked uh as a
[75:41] bartender before I started the company
[75:43] and so I've only ever kind of worked for
[75:44] myself in this way um and uh as a as an
[75:49] entrepreneur who owns a business you
[75:51] never contribute CPP um because you
[75:54] don't pay yourself uh T4 income or
[75:56] unemployment income and so
[76:00] um I think it's
[76:02] criminal and evident of a Ponzi scheme
[76:06] that you are forced to invest money with
[76:09] a pension fund um I think that uh it's
[76:14] like yeah it's just you can just tell
[76:16] it's a Ponzi and so I think that uh
[76:20] ideally it does become you know not
[76:24] mandatory anymore but if if I look at
[76:28] who owns the Pension funds and who's
[76:29] incentivized to keep the Pension funds
[76:31] going those incentives are misaligned
[76:34] already and so I think they will remain
[76:37] mandatory not because I think they
[76:39] should be mandatory but because I think
[76:42] the Communists in charge of the Pension
[76:44] funds will continue to need them to be
[76:47] mandatory to keep the Ponzi alive oh
[76:51] yeah very true similar situation in
[76:53] Austria uh thank you so much
[76:55] Adam for being on before I let you go
[76:57] where can people find you ask your
[76:58] questions and reach out to you yeah hit

[77:26] towards where it needs to be and so we
[77:28] need the bitcoiners that care about
[77:29] self- custody if you care about the
[77:31] future of self- custody um please use
[77:33] Bitcoin well tell us how we can improve
[77:36] this is going to happen together it's
[77:37] not going to be because we've got you

[77:41] holding it behind it's going to be
[77:43] decentralized we're going to take
[77:44] feedback we're going to implement
[77:45] feedback we're gonna we're gonna make
[77:46] mistakes we're going to fix them and
[77:48] we're going to March forward together so
[77:50] use the platform if you like it let us
[77:52] know what we can change to make it
[77:53] better if you don't like it let us know
