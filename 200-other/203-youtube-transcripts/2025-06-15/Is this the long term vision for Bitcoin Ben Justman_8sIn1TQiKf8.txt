[00:00] wine Bitcoin and steak are three things
[00:02] that weirdly all mail really well
[00:04] together I mean if you mail all three
[00:05] you've got a great dinner and you have a
[00:07] good conversation to talk about with
[00:09] Bitcoin that will just last forever we
[00:10] all have the incentive to root for each
[00:12] other because we have the same store
[00:14] value day to day every year the value of
[00:17] Bitcoin goes up not measured in dollars
[00:19] but measured in real world Goods that's
[00:20] like the long-term vision of of sound
[00:22] money where everything gets cheaper
[00:24] because we get better at making
[00:26] it finally I can ask someone that
[00:29] question what do you think is the
[00:31] connection between Bitcoin wine and
[00:34] Stakes well I think they're all kind of
[00:38] singular like singular input items
[00:43] that uh
[00:45] fundamentally enter like a low time
[00:47] preference lifestyle where Bitcoin is as
[00:53] most people listening are aware is low
[00:54] time preference money hold it for a long
[00:56] time you're going to do well it's not
[00:58] going to like you're not gener generally
[01:00] buying it for rocket ship make a ton of
[01:02] money real quick even though that does
[01:04] happen occasionally um if you're in it
[01:06] for that you kind of just uh get shaken
[01:08] out quickly um but it's one thing it's
[01:13] simple just have Bitcoin with wine it's
[01:17] at its core one ingredient which is
[01:19] grapes plus th and that is like a a
[01:26] pretty simple thing that adds a lot of
[01:28] enjoyment to the to other aspects of
[01:30] your life where um you can have a nice
[01:33] simple bottle of wine with friends and
[01:35] have a great conversation or it enhances
[01:37] a nice meal and the idea is if you hold
[01:41] it for a while it's G to get better
[01:43] generally and the the quicker you rush
[01:46] it even opening a bottle it's not going
[01:48] to be as good right away so like even
[01:51] the small little thing of opening a
[01:53] bottle you want to give it some time to
[01:54] breathe and it'll be a better experience
[01:56] with steak it's this is probably the
[01:59] newest part of of my journey was um
[02:01] learning about nutrition through the
[02:03] lens of wanting to be a better better
[02:05] business operator where nutrition and my
[02:08] body were kind of the things that were
[02:10] holding me back from performance and I
[02:13] realized that I wanted to be a better
[02:16] business person so I need to increase
[02:18] the things I'm bad at and I learned that
[02:21] just eating a ton of beef would be super
[02:26] beneficial for me through experience
[02:28] trying it my brain fogging way and I
[02:30] just had a lot more energy to do the
[02:32] work that I wanted to do and so uh steak
[02:36] kind of it's a bit of a meme to me where
[02:39] it's like just eat steak and you're G to
[02:41] be fine obviously I I eat a little bit
[02:43] more than that but it's this base
[02:46] singular layer of a healthy diet where
[02:50] when I just go full carnivore and let's
[02:53] say I just eat steak for a few days or a
[02:55] week it's I feel super energetic and
[02:58] like super um almost like Primal to to
[03:02] like go out and do what I want to do so
[03:05] wine Bitcoin and stake are are three
[03:08] things
[03:09] that weirdly all mail really well
[03:11] together I think wine and steak you see
[03:13] the the connection there but I mean if
[03:14] you mailed all three you've got a great
[03:16] dinner uh that's fueling you up for a
[03:19] long-term future of building
[03:21] and you have a good conversation to talk
[03:24] about with Bitcoin that'll just last
[03:25] forever so yeah it's it's funny that uh
[03:29] like if you have a low time preference
[03:31] and you see the like as in a farm and
[03:34] you I think you also grew up on a farm
[03:37] like I we talked before the podcast and
[03:39] I also grew kind of up on a farm and you
[03:43] get this low time preference because you
[03:45] plant seed like depends on what are you
[03:47] doing on a farm because you can do a lot
[03:49] of different things but you're planting
[03:51] a seed you're doing something and
[03:53] waiting a long period of time to get
[03:57] some reward and you're doing it all over
[03:59] over and over again and you grow slowly
[04:01] you grow steadily you enjoy nature and
[04:04] it's interesting that a digital thing uh
[04:07] is so connected with like nature and and
[04:09] enjoying time I also saw that one tweet
[04:11] of yours lately that I think with the
[04:14] Apple Vision Pro and the people are
[04:16] sitting with with the Apple Vision mod
[04:18] there and there's no phone and you said
[04:20] like something with Nature's healing
[04:22] because there's no phone obviously it's
[04:23] like a joking uh but I I I really
[04:26] enjoyed that one um yeah what what what
[04:30] what's your thought on like growing up
[04:32] on a farm having like a simple simpler
[04:35] life on on a farm and I experience that
[04:38] live like just just doing the small task
[04:41] and the simple tasks uh but building on
[04:45] a solid foundation and being connected
[04:47] with
[04:48] nature and putting in like the proof of
[04:51] work and then also making it anyways in
[04:55] that hyper Global glob globalized and
[04:58] digitalized uh uh world it's like an
[05:01] it's an interesting field to be in with
[05:04] Bitcoin and farming and and wine what's
[05:07] your thoughts on
[05:09] this growing up on a farm I kind of
[05:12] thought it was just normal I guess I
[05:16] grew up in a small town of 2000 and even
[05:19] if people didn't have Farms it was very
[05:22] common to just go off go into nature and
[05:25] just do whatever and you know not not a
[05:28] ton of parents super Vision because you
[05:31] know you couldn't get in a ton of
[05:34] trouble um outside of trouble that maybe
[05:37] you create for yourself so like you know
[05:39] you learn how to not fall in the river
[05:42] or you know not get lost and um I think
[05:45] that that's something that that is just
[05:48] like it's these little things these
[05:50] little skills that you develop as a kid
[05:51] and like learning how to figure out and
[05:52] solve problems um that if you grow up in
[05:57] a in a Suburban neighborhood Maybe
[05:59] you're just not given that level of
[06:03] problem solving to to have at a young
[06:05] age where um it and also parents kind of
[06:08] want to protect you and so it's it's a
[06:11] bit of freedom to make mistakes and um
[06:14] kind of just yeah play in the land learn
[06:16] how nature works and learn the
[06:18] consequences of little things so um in
[06:22] that you you just gain a lot of faith in
[06:25] yourself and you realize that a lot of
[06:28] times things are left back
[06:30] untouched so taking that mindset into
[06:34] money and Bitcoin is is pretty just
[06:37] straightforward in that you learn that
[06:39] economies are best managed by
[06:42] individuals just doing their own thing
[06:44] left untouched and money monetary policy
[06:47] is best left untouched and consistent
[06:50] just like the laws of nature are
[06:52] consistent um if you leave money as a
[06:54] constant things tend to um work out
[06:59] pretty well well so with farming it's
[07:03] the more and more Farmers I meet it's
[07:05] I've realized it's really hard to make
[07:06] it as a farmer unless you're an insanely
[07:09] large scale and if you don't have a
[07:12] value added good and if you don't have a
[07:14] larger audience than maybe you're a
[07:16] small town because I've been doing
[07:18] farmers markets for the last three years
[07:22] as my main source of in-person sales and
[07:26] and my main source of sales anyway um I
[07:29] didn't really want to have an online
[07:31] presence because I didn't want to work
[07:32] on my computer I had it but not
[07:35] seriously approaching it um and it's
[07:38] huge startup Capital to have a tasting
[07:41] room and have employees and all that
[07:43] stuff so I was really just bootstrapping
[07:45] the winery going to farmers markets and
[07:48] you meet a lot of small business people
[07:49] a lot of farmers and everything and I a
[07:53] lot of times think my work is really
[07:55] hard I mean I during the summer I do
[07:58] Friday Saturday
[07:59] Sunday um three-day stretch of three
[08:02] markets all two hours away from me so um
[08:05] it's 3 12h hour days back to back and
[08:08] then I work the rest of the week as well
[08:09] so it's it's super busy but I A lot of
[08:13] times I'm like man that's so hard I'm
[08:15] putting in so much work and then I meet
[08:16] a farmer who's doing vegetables and they
[08:19] might be selling a lot more than me as
[08:22] far as volume but like their margins are
[08:24] a lot smaller and they're up at 400 a.m.
[08:26] every morning picking the vegetables
[08:27] whereas all I have to do in the morning
[08:29] is drive to my wine seller pick up a few
[08:32] bottles of wine and then get on the road
[08:33] because everything's packaged and ready
[08:35] for it um along with
[08:39] that grapes are such a small part of the
[08:42] expense of making wine I can't kind of
[08:45] can't believe people grow grapes for a
[08:47] living outside of just super large scale
[08:50] because the you need that value added
[08:52] part of it to really make it worthwhile
[08:55] and so the connection to like wanting to
[08:57] be more Global on online just connect
[09:00] with the larger World works when you
[09:02] have a value out of good a package good
[09:04] that you can ship all over because if I
[09:07] was just selling to people in my neck of
[09:10] the woods I have ski towns near me that
[09:12] there's people with money and they they
[09:14] appreciate what I have uh but it takes a
[09:16] lot of effort to get there and my small
[09:19] town is super working class definitely
[09:22] not a ton of money here and if I was
[09:24] just trying to sell wine to them not
[09:25] only are they small but they can't
[09:27] really afford to value my product in the
[09:30] way that I believe it's worthwhile to be
[09:33] valued on on like a greater market so
[09:37] I've really just had to find the market
[09:41] that fits my product that values it in
[09:44] the way that it I believe it should be
[09:46] valued um based off its
[09:48] quality and within that it's connecting
[09:52] all these low time preference things and
[09:54] and kind of just being a bitcoiner
[09:56] individually that I fell into uh
[09:59] bitcoiners are the perfect people to be
[10:02] buying my product because they care
[10:04] about health they care about supporting
[10:05] like small business and uh people that
[10:09] they see as their own U to to make it
[10:12] and make a good product and like do
[10:14] farming the right way do wine the right
[10:17] way as far as not adding any um bad
[10:20] ingredients to the wine
[10:23] and having Bitcoin AS Global money
[10:26] having that knowledge um has connected
[10:28] me to a great sphere of people who also
[10:31] have that like long-term time preference
[10:32] when it comes to business which is how
[10:34] I'm building mine and people that value
[10:38] that so it's really just it's kind of
[10:40] been a perfect marriage between Bitcoin
[10:41] and farming um in a bit of a roundabout
[10:45] but like looking backwards it's a
[10:47] no-brainer kind of way and now you
[10:49] transformed uh your business more to
[10:52] online and less to the farmers are you
[10:55] still doing the farmers
[10:57] market yeah I'm still doing the the
[10:59] farmers markets I realistically it's not
[11:02] a long-term thing um hiring someone to
[11:04] do
[11:05] them is difficult because they have to
[11:08] store a bunch of wine um it's just kind
[11:11] of a hard day and the amount of money I
[11:14] make is not really worthwhile to pay
[11:16] someone the excess amount of money that
[11:18] it takes to go through that hard day um
[11:22] also I have to trust them to store the
[11:23] wine properly and they have just tons of
[11:25] gear So currently I'm still doing
[11:28] farmers markets and that's my plan for
[11:29] this coming summer but the the first
[11:32] year 100% of my money I I've been in
[11:35] I've had the winery for five years I've
[11:37] had three years of sales two years of
[11:38] Aging before that uh before I made my
[11:41] first sale and so in those three years
[11:44] my first year was 100% Farmers Market
[11:47] Revenue second year was 90% Farmers
[11:50] Market 10% online and last year was
[11:52] about 5050 so the online is growing
[11:55] quite a bit and in that I'm really
[11:57] finding a bit more of a marketing voice
[12:00] and just more customers who appreciate
[12:02] it getting the word out more I mean it's
[12:03] it's pretty steady growth but also
[12:06] that's what happens when you enter a
[12:08] global like for me it's United States
[12:10] Marketplace just where you have a lot
[12:11] more expanded reach um than what I can
[12:14] do physically so it expands what I do
[12:17] and that's definitely the direction I'm
[12:18] pointing things but in the
[12:21] end that's kind of a means to an end a
[12:24] means to get back to my hometown where
[12:27] my main goal is like I want to live in
[12:29] my hometown I want to give my kids a
[12:32] similar childhood to what I had and I
[12:35] want to be run a successful business and
[12:38] with that successful business I want my
[12:40] town to receive a lot of that benefit um
[12:43] not as far as like I'm not the kind of
[12:45] person who like donates a ton of money
[12:46] to charity or anything like that that's
[12:48] not really my goal my goal is to create
[12:51] a cool space for uh good Minds to come
[12:54] together have good conversations and
[12:56] create a little bit more traffic through
[12:57] my town to allow other businesses to
[13:00] have now the potential customers to to
[13:03] grow and in that it's like I want to do
[13:07] this for selfish reasons I want to live
[13:09] in a cool town for the rest of my life
[13:12] and to do that I think I have to be
[13:14] successful and create the space that I
[13:16] want to
[13:17] create um to bring people in that I want
[13:20] to be with so selling online expands my
[13:24] reach it allows me to make more money
[13:25] it's it's fun for me I mean I like being
[13:27] on Twitter and to bitcoin or in
[13:29] marketing and everything but um in the
[13:32] end the long-term goal is to really just
[13:34] make my town a better place and having
[13:36] that money come in from the outside
[13:37] allows me to fund that yeah it's I think
[13:40] a a really good um philosophy to be like
[13:45] no I'm not just uh traveling away seeing
[13:48] some other places where can I live going
[13:51] to uh weird places to find a better
[13:54] place to live uh but instead staying uh
[13:58] in in your local roots and trying to uh
[14:02] make your local community local Town
[14:04] whatever a better place is is something
[14:08] uh really really cool I think there was
[14:10] like I don't remember who who it was
[14:13] like really famous guy who who went to
[14:15] rock uh went to like a rocket University
[14:18] something like that and he want he said
[14:20] like before I want to go up in in space
[14:24] and do the Rockets I want to do
[14:25] something for for here for the
[14:27] environment and do something for um yeah
[14:31] the world the Earth before I go
[14:33] somewhere else and it's I think it's
[14:36] goes back to that this whole Bitcoin
[14:38] thing that like like that's also
[14:42] interesting question for you um uh a lot
[14:45] of people say like Bitcoin fixes that
[14:46] Bitcoin fixes everything I have a little
[14:49] bit of a different view it's like the
[14:50] Bitcoin is a base
[14:53] Foundation uh to to our life and it did
[14:57] it does not fix
[14:59] uh anything but with being a solid
[15:02] foundation you have the possibility to
[15:05] to to do a lot better it's like if you
[15:08] run on like a solid Street you're
[15:11] running really good and you can run fast
[15:14] but you still need to train you still
[15:15] need to work out you still need to do
[15:17] something uh and bitco gives you the
[15:19] solid Street and on a field system
[15:21] you're like running on Sand and you're
[15:23] like falling in there and it's just way
[15:26] harder to do stuff uh but what is your
[15:29] view on that like is is Bitcoin just
[15:30] money or does it go deeper and maybe
[15:33] also in that uh question in there uh you
[15:37] had this low time preference before I
[15:39] think because of the farm you had this
[15:41] mindset also before you found Bitcoin uh
[15:45] or did you get something of that also
[15:48] with Bitcoin I think the way you think
[15:50] about it is pretty similar to the way I
[15:51] think about it in that humans are still
[15:54] human um everyone's there's going to be
[15:57] people that are not doing well there's
[15:59] going to be people that are doing well
[16:00] it's all relative
[16:02] but for instance if you live in like I
[16:05] had a a pretty stable childhood I I was
[16:08] uprooted lived in Austin Texas in the
[16:11] city went out till I was eight had a lot
[16:12] of great friends and then moved to
[16:14] smalltown Colorado so like I had one big
[16:16] uproot But ultimately I had a stable
[16:19] family um money wasn't like always a
[16:23] fear and food on the table you know I
[16:26] had everything I needed and space to run
[16:27] around and play and within that I was
[16:29] able to like build myself into someone
[16:32] that I I mean I have high goals for
[16:34] myself and um was able to do well or at
[16:38] least on the path of doing well and if I
[16:41] grew up in a home that was unstable
[16:44] whether it be emotionally or financially
[16:46] or moving around all the time those it's
[16:49] a lot harder to like grab
[16:51] your grab who you are a lot of times and
[16:55] really build yourself up there's more
[16:57] just survival and so so if the ground's
[16:59] always moving underneath you like the
[17:00] Fiat systems always kind of dragging you
[17:02] down pulling you back it's really hard
[17:05] to think long term and think those
[17:07] things that are going to bring you
[17:08] success in the long run and so I don't
[17:11] think yeah I don't think Bitcoin fixes
[17:13] everything I think taking a longer time
[17:15] approach and having the ability to take
[17:17] a long time approach um creates better
[17:20] Solutions in the end because if we're
[17:21] just triling to duct tape everything
[17:23] it's obviously going to start falling
[17:25] apart eventually uh for me my my dad
[17:28] built houses his whole life my mom um
[17:32] was a realtor and then when I was born
[17:33] raised me so I but I think I get my
[17:37] longterm I get a bit of longterm from
[17:39] both of them um my mom was just a super
[17:41] supportive mom and was always like you
[17:44] know you're gonna be successful you can
[17:47] be whatever you want to be her answer
[17:48] was always you're going to be the
[17:49] president of the United States one day
[17:51] just to that was kind of like the
[17:52] loftiest goal like looking at it now
[17:55] it's like yeah wow I would not want to
[17:57] be a politician but but um my dad always
[18:00] built houses and was always working
[18:01] great role model as far as working goes
[18:04] and I think he gave me a great framework
[18:09] for what life is in the sense that he
[18:14] grew
[18:15] up always wanted a farm and
[18:18] his mom told him well Farms are
[18:21] expensive and you're not inheriting one
[18:23] so you better get to work and so he
[18:25] worked his whole life and eventually at
[18:27] 52 he sold all everything bought a farm
[18:31] and retired to work 10 hours a day so to
[18:36] me I've always just had a view of
[18:39] retirement as retire to mean money is
[18:43] not the thing that you're always working
[18:46] for you're working for yourself you're
[18:47] working for enjoyment and so with that
[18:50] money's never really been the answer for
[18:52] me it's always been I want to I want to
[18:54] find what I enjoy doing and that's
[18:58] allowed me to like start this business
[19:00] and see the long-term thing is like no I
[19:02] don't want to become this huge Winery
[19:04] with a ton of employees and like worry
[19:06] about all these little things I want to
[19:08] just create a small business that funds
[19:10] my lifestyle and Save in Bitcoin which
[19:13] allows me to to think a little bit
[19:14] bigger in the future and not worry about
[19:18] my savings just kind of have that hidden
[19:19] away like he had his real estate Hidden
[19:22] Away in in his day and uh build towards
[19:26] the life I want which I just happened to
[19:28] be a person who enjoys being an
[19:30] entrepreneur enjoys running a business
[19:33] and that's what I want to do whether
[19:35] it's big or small I don't care and I'm
[19:37] really leaning on the fact that like I
[19:40] kind of like having my hands in
[19:42] everything and um keeping things lean
[19:45] and using it as a vehicle to um may like
[19:49] support my community educate my
[19:51] community on bitcoin which is um
[19:54] something I'm I've always wanted to do
[19:57] but like I need a little bit more more
[19:58] success to be able to be listened to and
[20:01] uh also to educate my family and support
[20:03] my family and so um that's all all been
[20:07] the goal it's
[20:09] not I'm not you don't get into wine to
[20:12] get rich quick I I don't think uh but
[20:14] it's really just For the Love of the
[20:16] Game for me yeah I think there are other
[20:20] ways like there there are other
[20:22] Industries for people that really want
[20:25] to just go and get rich quick and I
[20:28] think uh those are usually the the
[20:31] industries and the the people that
[20:34] actually lose over time uh because they
[20:37] uh want to to to have like a quick Buck
[20:40] but they don't see the long-term goal
[20:42] like building something longterm is so
[20:44] important and you said like your dad was
[20:47] like 52 when he bought the farm how old
[20:49] were you then you I think you you were
[20:52] around I was eight so that's when we
[20:54] moved to Colorado um yeah so 52 when I
[20:57] was a kid that was like old my dad's
[20:59] always been old he was you know what 4
[21:02] 44 45 when I was born
[21:05] so uh now in hindsight I'm like damn my
[21:08] dad retired when he was 50 like that's
[21:11] that's badass I want to do that so like
[21:13] that's always been my goal is to kind of
[21:15] through my 20s just figure out what I
[21:17] want to do with my life um try a bunch
[21:20] of different things um I'm not 30 yet so
[21:23] I always think now I'm thinking in my
[21:25] 30s is like I have what I'm doing let's
[21:27] just do that successfully let's build a
[21:29] family all that stuff and then 40s uh
[21:32] really succeed just kind of be at the
[21:34] top of my game and then 50s like you
[21:36] know whatever I want to do from there
[21:38] hopefully I've made it by then goal is
[21:40] to make it by then is is uh your wine uh
[21:45] Winery how do they say it wine farm what
[21:48] what is it Winery so yeah Winery is like
[21:52] the production of wine and a lot of
[21:53] times that includes also the vineyard um
[21:56] we've got a Vineyard as well it's that's
[21:58] more my dad's doing than me I run the
[22:02] winery okay and this is also on the farm
[22:05] of your dad or is it like separate uh
[22:07] like it's a new location or
[22:10] something it's the I my Foundation is my
[22:15] dad's grapes my dad's P Noir are the
[22:18] highest elevation P Noir in North
[22:20] America I make natural wine out of that
[22:23] and um it's that was what I had my
[22:26] history because he made wine
[22:28] um as a hobby and so I knew that that
[22:31] wine would be good but also to run the
[22:32] winery I've had to expand towards buying
[22:35] grapes from other people just to be able
[22:38] to fill up all these barrels because my
[22:40] dad's production is only so much and GE
[22:42] to gear things shift a ton so I can use
[22:46] that fluctuation to my advantage by um
[22:49] having more space for different
[22:50] varieties at different times um I my
[22:54] wine room is what his wine room used to
[22:57] be but but like I expanded it a ton so
[23:01] there's a bit of family business in this
[23:02] and that like when I was looking I was
[23:06] really at 26 just looking to start a
[23:08] business and looking for something that
[23:10] like wasn't a side hustle I was like
[23:12] what a quarter life crisis like what am
[23:14] I going to do with my life and knew I
[23:16] wanted to start a business but wanted to
[23:18] commit to something and my having my dad
[23:21] as a a wine maker
[23:23] hobbyist was like oh you have all the
[23:26] infrastructure to like get me going I
[23:28] can make however much wine I need to
[23:30] start and then I'll just make a little
[23:31] bit more the next year and like continue
[23:33] to slowly expand as my wine ages and I
[23:35] sell it and um so basically I grabbed on
[23:39] to what he was doing took his Hobby and
[23:41] scaled it up a lot um using a lot of his
[23:45] infrastructure this is a building that
[23:46] he owns that I'm in the back of um that
[23:49] back wall is underground so it stays
[23:52] it's a perfect wine seller um but
[23:56] ultimately as the son of a successful
[24:00] father I want to like Escape his shadow
[24:04] and do my own thing so it's always been
[24:06] a bit of like a you know I haven't quite
[24:09] made it yet like I he loaned me money to
[24:11] start the business so like once I pay
[24:12] him off that's going to be the ultimate
[24:14] feeling of like I made it on my own I
[24:16] don't need you anymore this is my thing
[24:19] um but in the meantime I buy his grapes
[24:22] and I pay him back for the startup
[24:24] Capital he gave me and so I'm very cogn
[24:28] of like really trying to make this my
[24:29] own thing and whenever someone says like
[24:34] oh cool it's a family business I'm
[24:36] always like it is it so is and that's
[24:38] what I want it to be for my family like
[24:40] the family I create as well but uh this
[24:43] is so much like I want to make my mark
[24:46] on the world Beyond or outside of what
[24:49] he's done you know yeah I think there's
[24:52] a big difference between family
[24:54] businesses where the sun is basically
[24:56] just going on with that what the father
[24:59] created and just like doing whatever he
[25:03] did did uh and just doing it a little
[25:05] bit uh modern maybe and sometimes just
[25:09] just going along with it and the Sun
[25:13] that actually Builds on the foundation
[25:15] what the father did and makes it way
[25:18] better and and in his own way like as
[25:21] you said the writing on the wall it's
[25:23] interesting because my father always and
[25:25] I have this so in R in my brain uh he
[25:29] also built a business he founded a
[25:31] company uh like Construction Company
[25:34] basically and one day we were on the
[25:37] construction side with him I was like
[25:39] maybe like 10 12 something around that
[25:42] but that scene kept was stuck in my head
[25:45] since then and and one of the workers
[25:48] there asked my dad like oh this is your
[25:50] son he will inherit your business and He
[25:52] will carry it on and stuff like that and
[25:55] he's like my son is not even allowed to
[25:57] be in my business he's like he he has to
[26:00] do it on his own he has to find his own
[26:02] path and if his path is exactly in that
[26:06] and he finds his own way right here to
[26:09] my industry my business that's okay I
[26:12] did not in the end till now at least H
[26:15] but that's okay but he has like he
[26:18] always pushed me to do do my own way to
[26:21] do my own thing like from really early
[26:23] on I remember those those things and I
[26:25] think it's important and I think also
[26:27] something that that you have in there
[26:30] but maybe like let's come back to like
[26:32] uh Bitcoin and then like self- custody
[26:35] because I see yeah on that real quick um
[26:39] it's interesting you say that because I
[26:41] I think that I was my dad always gave me
[26:44] the freedom like you know do whatever
[26:46] you're going to do and there was never
[26:47] any pressure like going to college he
[26:49] always said like I never use my degree
[26:51] College was the best time you're going
[26:53] to learn a ton you're going to meet a
[26:54] lot of great people go and you know
[26:56] figure out what you're going to do um so
[26:58] I never really felt pressur to like do
[27:00] his thing but like there was always
[27:01] subtle things like um my job growing up
[27:05] every summer from like you know uh 12
[27:08] was to work on the farm I hated it and
[27:11] then a lot of times there was
[27:13] construction jobs that I had to do and
[27:15] that was his you know both of those his
[27:17] things and I he's my boss I got to do it
[27:19] his way and so I always kind of wish
[27:23] like looking back I kind of wish that I
[27:25] had it like you where I was pushed out
[27:27] no you're not working for me go find
[27:29] your own thing because I think I would
[27:30] have found my thing quicker than being
[27:33] in a position where it was like no dad
[27:37] like just total Rebel screw you I don't
[27:39] want to be part of this um whereas like
[27:43] what he's done is amazing and like I
[27:44] should be thankful but I was kind of
[27:47] just my inherit rebellious mindset and
[27:49] just wanting to do my own thing so
[27:51] strongly um which is what led me to the
[27:53] path I'm
[27:54] on pushed me out of
[27:58] it was more of a rebellion than like a
[28:01] going to find my own thing and I guess I
[28:05] just personally I wish I'd been pushed
[28:08] out of the nest a little a little sooner
[28:10] um and I I think the way your your dad
[28:12] phrased it that's that's really cool I'm
[28:15] super excited to announce that this
[28:17] podcast got the first ever sponsor 21
[28:21] Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one and
[28:24] they teach and preach self- custody this
[28:27] is my goto exchange when someone asks me
[28:31] oh where can I buy my Bitcoin from this
[28:33] is the easiest entry for bitcoiners and
[28:37] if you want lower fees Plus at the same
[28:39] time support this podcast use code Robin
[28:42] and click the link in the description
[28:44] yeah it's uh it's an interesting uh
[28:47] journey I think as I I mean my dad was
[28:50] not that successful like he was not like
[28:53] really rich dude but he did like okay in
[28:55] middle class uh uh and it's always
[28:59] interesting to see and I have some
[29:00] friends that have really successful dads
[29:03] and for them I see the the the problems
[29:07] because they are like as you said living
[29:09] in the shadow and they want to uh come
[29:12] out of that shadow but if the shadow is
[29:15] so
[29:16] big it's really hard sometimes and it's
[29:20] interesting to see um yeah I try to make
[29:25] now the way back to like self cust in
[29:27] Bitcoin and I see your like you have in
[29:30] in in in your background the the wines
[29:33] the the barrels I think they're called
[29:36] in English like I'm German native so
[29:38] sometimes I it's hard for me to find the
[29:40] the right
[29:41] words um and did you had uh I think I
[29:46] speak with a lot of people about Bitcoin
[29:49] and a lot about the learnings of Bitcoin
[29:51] and usually they come along with the
[29:53] story like a lot of people have like
[29:55] shitcoin faces and then come to bitcoin
[29:58] only a lot of people have all the
[29:59] Bitcoin on exchanges then they have
[30:02] experienced uh pain or they saw Pain by
[30:06] from other people or they got educated
[30:08] and then they went into self- custody uh
[30:11] and then all those learnings you go
[30:13] through in the beginning uh I'm curious
[30:16] about you because you had those like
[30:19] values and those self- custody and self
[30:21] sustainability I also guess like your
[30:23] farm made stuff that you like your own
[30:26] food maybe like milk I don't know uh
[30:28] stuff like that um how was your like
[30:32] Bitcoin Journey uh unique because of
[30:36] your upbringing because of the farm life
[30:38] because of your mindset being different
[30:40] to like maybe a completely modern city
[30:43] living
[30:45] person in 2017 I guess was my first real
[30:49] exposure and um in that you're just like
[30:53] oh it's crazy let me like do 10 minutes
[30:55] of Internet Internet research see what
[30:57] this is
[30:59] um and in that internet research all I
[31:02] saw was bitcoin's old all this other
[31:04] stuff is like new and exciting in the
[31:06] future so like I bought a little
[31:07] ethereum and a little xrp and then you
[31:09] know bought the top of those and for
[31:12] four years I was just kind of they were
[31:14] there I didn't look at them but you know
[31:17] just didn't really think about it again
[31:20] and what I was preached growing up was
[31:23] always like save my dad always tells me
[31:25] stories of living in Aspen in the 70s
[31:29] and like living in a two-bedroom house
[31:32] with like 10 people and like having
[31:34] curtains for walls and his whole deal
[31:38] was I always saved 50% of what I made
[31:42] and to me that's a little crazy I mean
[31:44] it's a different time um the money's
[31:46] obviously gotten a lot worse it's a lot
[31:48] harder to save um a high amount of what
[31:50] you're doing but also like if you live
[31:52] with that much frugality you definitely
[31:54] can and so that frugal nature wanting to
[31:58] save wanting to be conservative with
[31:59] investing and all that stuff was was
[32:01] very much ingrained to me um I read a
[32:04] book about buying stocks and um in that
[32:08] book I was like this is really
[32:08] interesting there's no way I'm gonna do
[32:11] this that's so much work so I was always
[32:13] uh buying index funds having high
[32:15] interest savings accounts paying the
[32:17] credit card bonus game where um you just
[32:20] get a new credit card they pay pay you
[32:22] 500 bucks
[32:24] and um I kind of was like good I got my
[32:27] savings account is keeping up with
[32:29] inflation but in
[32:31] 2019 um the interest rates on all my
[32:33] savings accounts went from 2% to zero
[32:36] and I mean 2% is not a ton but like it
[32:39] kept me at float with inflation and so
[32:43] that was kind of like the rug being
[32:45] pulled out from under me by the the
[32:47] current monetary system and realizing
[32:49] that there's no way I can just like
[32:51] slowly keep up without taking serious
[32:53] risk in the stock market which I knew I
[32:56] didn't want to do so um within that I
[32:59] just started kind of like looking I was
[33:01] like something's not right what am I
[33:02] going to do and then after I started the
[33:05] winery and then I moved home to my
[33:07] hometown to build my house with my
[33:11] dad I moved in with a good friend from
[33:14] high school who just happened to be a
[33:15] bitcoiner and him being like the
[33:18] smartest person I knew we having these
[33:21] conversations about geopolitics U money
[33:23] Finance all that stuff um you know he's
[33:26] trying to make it in business business
[33:27] as well and so he just got me to start
[33:31] learning about Bitcoin and yeah I bought
[33:33] a couple more shitcoins throughout then
[33:34] but like ultimately it was the path of
[33:37] learning about money what is money and
[33:39] learning that Bitcoin is the perfect
[33:40] money um
[33:42] unfortunately I started buying and the
[33:44] price started screaming and right when I
[33:47] had my moment of like most intense
[33:49] conviction of like in my mind I'm like
[33:52] holy [ __ ] that's what Bitcoin is I need
[33:54] as much of this as possible with was
[33:57] also like a week before the price
[33:59] crashed 50% so I'm at this full Market
[34:02] conviction the price has been going up
[34:04] for a year in my head I'm like wow if
[34:07] that's what this is and the price is
[34:08] going up like this it's just going to
[34:10] keep going up forever there's no way
[34:13] that the price will ever come down
[34:15] because bitcoin's such an insane thing
[34:18] how could anyone not value it and so I
[34:21] went all in and then you know a week
[34:23] later the price crashed 50% and so I'm
[34:27] uh early stage winery that's made no
[34:31] money and invested two years and
[34:33] previously like all my money except for
[34:35] this little nest egg that I hadn't
[34:37] touched
[34:38] um now I'm completely invested in wine
[34:41] and completely invested in Bitcoin both
[34:43] of which have not seen returns both of
[34:45] which have just really taken all my
[34:46] money so I was fully convinced that I
[34:50] could you know make it in wine or was
[34:52] learning to be at least and then fully
[34:54] convinced on bitcoin but really just
[34:57] like that moment
[34:58] of I think I'm going to get rich I think
[35:00] I'm gonna like it's all going to come
[35:02] quickly oh man I'm so smart I'm doing
[35:03] the right thing was just like ripped out
[35:05] from under me and I had to learn the
[35:07] hard way that Bitcoin is a a lowte Time
[35:09] preference game um just like I was
[35:12] trying to play previously with like slow
[35:16] savings um and low you know low risk
[35:20] marketting like Index Fund Investments
[35:23] um and I've just kind of had to build
[35:25] slowly and think what that did is
[35:28] like I was the crazy dude as a lot of us
[35:31] are like a lot of our friends don't get
[35:33] Bitcoin and so like I'm going crazy
[35:35] thinking about how cool it is um then I
[35:37] lose all my like quote unquote all my
[35:39] money on it and um now I'm like okay
[35:44] well no one's going to want to talk to
[35:45] me about this or I just need more people
[35:47] to talk to and um then ended up finding
[35:49] the Bitcoin community on Twitter and
[35:53] that furthered my conviction realizing
[35:55] that there's like actually this huge
[35:57] amount of people that understand it
[35:59] outside of my tiny town where there's
[36:00] like five
[36:03] so yeah I don't know it's been this uh
[36:06] slow game of of uh every time I get
[36:09] really convicted on bitcoin it it drops
[36:11] until finally I've just had to um get
[36:13] the mindset out of my head that like
[36:15] there's no getting rich on bitcoin
[36:18] quickly it's just like save your money
[36:20] take the lower time preference you have
[36:22] the better because it's really a
[36:24] survival game where if you put put
[36:26] yourself in a position where the market
[36:28] swings can knock you out they will and
[36:31] if you can just survive that's all it
[36:32] takes to win yeah I think it's it's
[36:35] funny how uh Bitcoin always humbles you
[36:40] if you get like greedy if you get like a
[36:42] high time preference uh with all the
[36:45] Traders with everyone that ever touched
[36:48] like Leverage stuff with everyone that
[36:50] like wanted to to sell Bitcoin buy some
[36:53] altcoins just to outperform bitcoin get
[36:56] more bit coin in the end and like all
[36:58] those games and schemes that are
[37:01] involved in like trying the end goal of
[37:03] getting more Bitcoin and for some it
[37:06] worked obviously uh because they are
[37:08] lucky U for the most people it did not
[37:11] work because they were humbled but if
[37:14] you play those games long enough you
[37:17] will get humbled anyways so it's
[37:19] interesting uh to see and also as you
[37:21] touched on the the the perception in
[37:24] your town and like five people got it
[37:26] this is kind of like I I think in in my
[37:29] town it's also a really small town I'm
[37:31] living in and even even in the company
[37:34] uh there's like one guy that gets it and
[37:36] it's one of my best friends that I got
[37:38] into the company so that's this not it's
[37:41] not really fair that I say that there's
[37:43] one guy that gets it it's kind of fair
[37:45] to say like nobody gets it they're like
[37:47] two three crypto guys that are staked in
[37:50] something altcoin related and uh it's
[37:54] it's interesting how the the mainstream
[37:56] dream is just so wrong about Bitcoin
[38:00] will that like do do you see an in in
[38:03] future in like 10 20 years where uh
[38:08] those that what we are now talking on
[38:10] our small podcasts and on our twitters
[38:14] and our reddits and whatever uh we are
[38:16] on is this like do you see in future in
[38:20] like 10 years where people on national
[38:23] TV are talking about Bitcoin like we are
[38:25] doing like really understanding the
[38:27] technology and the economic system
[38:29] behind
[38:32] it what I think about with that
[38:34] is really the need for financial
[38:37] education where when I was learning
[38:40] about Bitcoin and previously before that
[38:43] I was really into like the minutia uh I
[38:45] mean I was listening to Fed stuff um I
[38:48] was like I said watching my savings
[38:50] account interest rate super closely um
[38:53] really just like I had to you know still
[38:55] have a deep spreadsheet of like like all
[38:56] my
[38:57] info um you know that I keep track of so
[39:01] I was like Target one for noticing small
[39:05] changes and then the huge shift with
[39:08] like um Financial policy and just like
[39:11] the rug of a lot of things with with
[39:14] covid shutdowns and and money printing
[39:17] so that got me but what I think about is
[39:20] all the people that along the way I
[39:22] tried to help with their personal
[39:23] finances and and
[39:25] realizing that they knew nothing about
[39:28] what what money was what their money was
[39:30] doing um investing anything like that
[39:33] and that's understandable for people in
[39:35] their early 20s it's not so you know I'm
[39:38] really just pointing at like the general
[39:42] that's what people are at is they have
[39:44] never had to learn about them about
[39:45] their money and if you're older
[39:47] especially you never had to learn about
[39:49] your money you just did it this way you
[39:51] invested it worked out but I think that
[39:54] that's like the
[39:57] the
[39:58] inherent problem with Americans
[40:00] understanding Bitcoin is that they've
[40:03] never had to think about their money
[40:04] because it's been a system that just
[40:05] works fine especially for Americans um
[40:08] and they don't see the third order
[40:10] consequences of manufacturing leaving
[40:12] the United States because our money is
[40:14] too strong so money just works for them
[40:17] generally and they don't have to think
[40:19] about it but over the coming decade what
[40:22] I'm expecting to see is money
[40:24] increasingly not work for people I mean
[40:25] we saw little flash of that with um
[40:28] super high CPI numbers that got everyone
[40:31] um caught up about inflation and you
[40:33] know hopefully that open the door and
[40:34] some people realize like oh I need to
[40:36] actually learn what inflation is and why
[40:38] it's why it's caused oh it's money
[40:40] printing so there's a few people that
[40:42] found it but ultimately like if you
[40:44] didn't find it over the last
[40:46] bit you probably were never just looking
[40:49] you just trusted your sources and you
[40:51] know maybe you got a good job during
[40:52] that time money's worked out for you but
[40:55] the reason I think a lot of times we see
[40:58] people in more third world or developing
[41:01] countries um they need Bitcoin a little
[41:03] bit more because they don't have the
[41:05] sort of infrastructure or the
[41:07] functioning monetary system like we have
[41:09] in the United States and so as things
[41:12] get a little bit more wonky that I
[41:13] expect over the next decade um I think
[41:17] people will just be more and more
[41:18] incentivized to actually learn about
[41:19] their money so it's almost like yeah I
[41:22] think Bitcoin on its own merits is so
[41:25] good that people will learn about it and
[41:27] continue um adopting it but ultimately
[41:31] you need a push to uproot your current
[41:34] understanding go down the the rabbit
[41:36] hole and understand Bitcoin so to me
[41:40] unfortunately I kind of expect that push
[41:41] to be on the negative side of people are
[41:44] like oh crap I really need to learn
[41:46] about Bitcoin because or I need to learn
[41:48] about the current system which leads
[41:50] them to bitcoin because it's not working
[41:51] for me what I'm trying to do with my
[41:53] business and just like
[41:57] provide education to my friends and
[41:59] anyone who's willing to listen honestly
[42:01] is to show the positive side where with
[42:06] Bitcoin you can succeed not with Fiat
[42:09] you'll fail so I'm doing it slowly
[42:12] really it's just like um I don't have a
[42:15] ton of presence in my local community
[42:17] right now it's not something I can
[42:19] really afford to do and so I just put
[42:23] I'm a bitcoiner on everything you know
[42:24] it's just like this is who I am if if
[42:26] you're curious if you ever get curious
[42:28] people know to come to me I also have uh
[42:31] the Bitcoin logo on all my bottles going
[42:33] forward and very much say on all my
[42:36] sales or all my in-person sales Bitcoin
[42:39] preferred um not expecting to get a ton
[42:41] of Bitcoin sales I do get a lot of
[42:43] bitcoiners coming up and that's it's
[42:44] super cool but it's mostly just to like
[42:46] put that out there associate Bitcoin the
[42:49] brand with my brand the good wine
[42:52] instead of Bitcoin for criminals so like
[42:55] let's associate Bitcoin with positive
[42:57] things let's associate Bitcoin with with
[42:59] someone who's succeeding and when I was
[43:03] like when I'm starting my business or
[43:05] wanting to learn what I look for is
[43:07] who's succeeding why are they succeeding
[43:10] how can I emulate that and if someone
[43:12] can just like look at me and see oh
[43:14] Bitcoin and they do Bitcoin like I think
[43:16] that's making the world um making their
[43:19] life better which like you know
[43:21] extrapolate that out makes the world
[43:23] better which is uh really really cool
[43:26] inside of the Bitcoin Community because
[43:27] we are getting to this point and we're
[43:30] like we're small community still I think
[43:32] bitcoiners we're getting really really
[43:34] big but uh we understand that we should
[43:37] help each other because if you succeed
[43:41] with your one uh vinary and getting
[43:43] bigger and bigger and making more sales
[43:45] you save your money in Bitcoin which is
[43:48] good for Bitcoin because you're
[43:50] long-term hler uh and also your brand is
[43:53] associated with Bitcoin so this also
[43:56] gets a brand benefit with Bitcoin the
[43:59] same way as uh when my podcast gets
[44:01] bigger it gets more audience it uh it uh
[44:04] gets more people educated like we all
[44:07] have the incentive to root for each
[44:09] other because we have this this uh the
[44:13] same uh unit the same store of value
[44:16] where we save everything in and we
[44:19] incentivized to help each other and it's
[44:22] such an amazing journey I mean the
[44:24] simplest example I think is is the
[44:26] podcast where I was so worried in the
[44:29] beginning that I don't get guests on and
[44:32] now uh since like I think 5th January or
[44:35] something like that I'm now on a streak
[44:37] where I like have every day a podcast
[44:40] guest uh since then it's like a month
[44:43] now and then also the next month I'm
[44:45] already booked out I sent uh the link to
[44:48] someone yesterday and he's like oh I
[44:50] think your Google calendar has like a
[44:52] mistake I don't see any uh uh
[44:54] appointments free in in Fe February like
[44:57] now it's beginning of February I'm like
[44:59] no actually it's not a mistake my next
[45:01] free appointment is like in the month
[45:04] because I'm so booked out and it's not
[45:06] because I'm such a great person it's
[45:08] just because people in the Bitcoin
[45:10] Community want to help each other and
[45:13] want to root for each other and and and
[45:15] they're really open and it's like I come
[45:17] from a fear chop where I'm in sales I'm
[45:19] used to having like 20 Nos and getting
[45:22] one yes and in Bitcoin it's like you're
[45:25] getting 19 yes and one no it's like an
[45:29] really interesting uh experience to be
[45:32] in the Bitcoin Bitcoin community and
[45:34] being in that uh interesting early
[45:37] adopter community and and seeing
[45:40] everybody rise everybody's doing
[45:42] something everybody has something that's
[45:45] going on like I did not see anyone that
[45:48] just does like and NPC stuff I always
[45:52] like non-playable character I probably
[45:53] you know it uh where when I see in my
[45:57] like outside of my bubble outside of the
[45:59] Bitcoin bubble you see a lot of people
[46:01] that they don't know what critical
[46:03] thinking is they don't know what Bitcoin
[46:04] is they they just get stuff and then
[46:07] they are just doing like what they're
[46:09] supposed to do like school maybe
[46:12] University then work retire die have
[46:15] maybe a a girlfriend or a wife next to
[46:19] it maybe I have kids like those are not
[46:22] bad things like uh having like those
[46:26] normal life is not bad at all but
[46:28] they're not asking those question like
[46:30] what money actually is they're not
[46:32] asking uh oh is that what what I hear
[46:36] really true like there like no matter
[46:38] where it's coming from but you should
[46:40] critical think for yourself like uh and
[46:43] this is something I don't know if it's
[46:45] gets better with Bitcoin do you think
[46:47] like this can get better with on a
[46:49] Bitcoin standard or will just get money
[46:52] fixed and like those people that don't
[46:55] critical think will always be there like
[46:58] is it a is it something that feared
[47:00] messed up or is it some just human
[47:02] beings uh being a
[47:05] lazy there's I mean just just like any
[47:08] answer I'll give like there's an element
[47:10] of that just in humans But ultimately I
[47:14] think being forced to always keep up or
[47:19] living in a society
[47:21] where it's just kind of unrealistic to
[47:23] feel like you're really going to make it
[47:25] that you don't really you're not trained
[47:27] or or you don't feel like it's even
[47:29] possible to think bigger than where you
[47:31] currently are or just a couple steps
[47:33] ahead but I think that with that strong
[47:36] Foundation that Bitcoin can give to
[47:38] society um I think more and more people
[47:42] will be able to pick their head up and
[47:43] like look further down because what I'm
[47:45] hearing you say is is people
[47:48] that phrase it however you want but
[47:51] ultimately are kind of just like doing
[47:53] the thing that gets them to the next day
[47:56] um the short-term enjoyment yeah I mean
[47:58] like people a lot of people that we
[48:00] would characterize as NPCs are super
[48:03] proficient on a certain thing like
[48:05] there's a lot of people that go to the
[48:06] gym all the time but still just like
[48:09] grind wake up their job party on the
[48:12] weekends um I guess I'm not necessarily
[48:15] trying to demonize that it's just a a
[48:17] stereotype
[48:19] and they don't people a lot of times
[48:23] don't ask questions like what what can
[48:25] like life fulfillment really be it's oh
[48:27] I'm going to make it and be rich uh one
[48:29] day or oh I guess I'll just have this
[48:32] house and make it and you know have a
[48:34] family and we'll be happy and ultimately
[48:36] like part of me is you know a little bit
[48:39] jealous of that because you not thinking
[48:42] about these existential questions is a
[48:44] bit of a freedom but you think back to
[48:46] where they actually are where their
[48:47] basis is is a lot of times just kind of
[48:49] entered servitude where they have to
[48:52] keep their job they have to have this
[48:54] mortgage and ultimately all those things
[48:56] are not going to lead
[48:58] towards the uh outcome that they want
[49:02] they should because they're doing the
[49:04] right thing they're saving money they're
[49:05] just living their life and doing what
[49:07] they're good at at their at their job
[49:09] but ultimately with money sucking people
[49:13] down the just the Fiat system being a
[49:15] black
[49:16] hole I think a lot of people are just
[49:18] going to be in for a roote Awakening and
[49:20] be forced
[49:23] to approach these Concepts
[49:26] through a time or a feeling of um of
[49:30] fear or just scrambling to to make
[49:32] things work whereas if you're thinking
[49:34] about them ahead of time you could be
[49:35] prepared and not freak out if something
[49:37] bad happens so that Foundation I think
[49:40] just allows people to broaden their mind
[49:44] and broaden their perspective I don't
[49:45] think it's like inherently a human thing
[49:49] um but there's always bits of that in
[49:52] there yeah it's I think about it a lot
[49:55] and I I mean it's not only about Bitcoin
[49:57] and critical thinking it's like I have
[49:59] such a huge desire to build something
[50:02] that's uh so much bigger than me and
[50:04] everything that I see uh and I'm I'm I'm
[50:08] grinding a lot and making the podcast
[50:11] next to like a full-time job now I'm
[50:13] scaling back a little bit the full-time
[50:15] job but uh it's it's it's something that
[50:18] only a few people do and sometimes I see
[50:22] uh friends or even family members that
[50:24] are just like
[50:26] uh making the normal job going home uh
[50:29] eating Netflix chill sleep and I think
[50:33] like oh shoot I I cannot do that like I
[50:36] I feel really I I just I just can't do
[50:39] it but it's it's maybe like they are
[50:42] happy obviously they're they they're not
[50:44] like feeling depressed they're not like
[50:46] on the on the edge of like suicide or
[50:49] something like they're happy they're
[50:50] just like just living their lives and
[50:53] it's it's an interesting interesting
[50:55] thing that some people like have this
[50:57] urge to do a lot and critical thing and
[51:01] uh to research so much uh and then you
[51:05] see the world where like oh they are
[51:07] just living their life and being in the
[51:09] in the system and they're happy with it
[51:11] and some like yeah why why am I this the
[51:15] person there but that's that's really I
[51:18] would say our common upbringing with
[51:21] with parents who had their own business
[51:23] and and the goal was to you know do your
[51:26] thing and the expectation was kind of
[51:29] you know to have your own business or uh
[51:32] be successful and in whatever way you
[51:34] see fit as opposed to um someone that
[51:38] comes from a family that you know
[51:40] there's nothing wrong with having a job
[51:42] I think I think a lot of people like
[51:44] entrepreneurship is super glorified
[51:46] these days and if it's not just in your
[51:49] nature if it's not something you have to
[51:50] do if you're not going insane just
[51:52] having a normal job I think you're C
[51:55] crazy to want to start your own business
[51:57] because it takes so much and you have so
[52:00] much responsibility on your shoulders
[52:01] like you got to be if if you're let's
[52:05] say you've had a job your whole life um
[52:08] but and you're thinking about becoming
[52:10] an entrepreneur um let's say you you're
[52:12] you played Sports if you weren't the
[52:13] kind of person that like wanted the ball
[52:16] on the last second like you wanted all
[52:18] the responsibility you thrive when times
[52:20] are crazy if you're not that kind of
[52:22] person I think entrepreneurship is is a
[52:24] pretty SC thing
[52:26] because it is all the time all on you
[52:31] yeah you maybe you build to a point
[52:32] where you have employees underneath you
[52:34] but realistically like their success is
[52:36] all pinned on you if you're at the top
[52:39] so if if you don't want that it's insane
[52:41] to go into entrepreneurship so with that
[52:45] I just
[52:46] like when I when I think about Bitcoin
[52:48] it's like yeah maybe you as a society we
[52:51] all have savings we can all kind of
[52:52] pitch in and you can afford to take more
[52:54] risk because either your family has
[52:56] savings to help back your new idea your
[52:58] community does or you do because you
[53:00] were actually able to save um but I
[53:03] don't think it creates more
[53:05] entrepreneurship necessarily it maybe
[53:08] creates people that are more comfortable
[53:09] with taking risks because they know the
[53:11] downside isn't so bad but ultimately
[53:14] it's it's a human trait to want to go
[53:17] off and do your own thing and I just
[53:20] want to live in a world where if you go
[53:23] to work and and do your job and have a
[53:25] nice family and just you know spend less
[53:28] money than you make I want that to be
[53:31] the mark of success and then anyone who
[53:33] wants to go and do other stuff like
[53:35] great but ultimately like it comes down
[53:37] to just if what you do makes you happy I
[53:41] want and you work hard like you know I'm
[53:43] not saying slouches but if you work hard
[53:46] and are diligent I think that should be
[53:48] enough to to make it in a realistic
[53:51] world and and that's really the world
[53:52] that I'm fighting for with Bitcoin I
[53:54] mean all the stuff on top of it like all
[53:56] the third order effects of having sound
[53:58] money I think will come but ultimately
[54:00] it starts with just people being able to
[54:02] go to work come home to their family
[54:03] enjoy their life whether they want to
[54:05] watch Netflix or not and you know have a
[54:10] just have a life that they can survive
[54:12] and put their kids in a better position
[54:14] than they were in yeah it's a that I
[54:18] think that's a really really uh good
[54:21] point to see because then you have the
[54:24] uh all the people having a device where
[54:27] they can effectively store their
[54:29] financial energy again in there and it
[54:32] it's always like this and I think it's
[54:34] so nice that Michael saor bitcoiner
[54:38] bought hope.com and reserved it for
[54:41] basically Bitcoin education because uh
[54:44] when I speak with bitcoiners hope is
[54:46] like always like some uh Central word or
[54:50] some theme that goes along in the in the
[54:53] conversations because it gives like the
[54:55] whole back to people that just can save
[54:58] again and like if you're a doctor you're
[55:00] like really good in in saving people's
[55:02] life and you should not be forced to be
[55:05] a portfolio manager on the side with
[55:07] your ETFs and index funds and stuff like
[55:09] that you should just have like one
[55:11] savings device where you put your money
[55:14] and this is it like this is where your
[55:17] financial energy can grow and your
[55:19] doctor or maybe your teacher or whatever
[55:22] you are you can you don't have to be
[55:25] forced to be a financial
[55:28] planner stock portfolio manager on the
[55:31] side to keep up with inflation so your
[55:33] savings don't get eroded like that's a
[55:35] really important thing I think in the
[55:37] the whole Bitcoin Bitcoin sphere and we
[55:40] sell that Vision to our friends and
[55:44] anyone that we like trying to get into
[55:45] Bitcoin But ultimately
[55:49] like yeah sure take a four-year time
[55:51] perspective but what you and I are
[55:53] talking about is like daytoday every
[55:55] year the value of Bitcoin goes up not
[55:58] measured in dollars but measured in real
[55:59] world Goods that's like the long-term
[56:01] vision of of sound money where
[56:04] everything gets cheaper because we get
[56:05] better at making it but when we're
[56:08] selling that Vision that is taking like
[56:10] four or five steps into Bitcoin that
[56:14] people haven't really had the chance to
[56:16] Grapple with yet everything
[56:18] foundationally leading up to that they
[56:20] don't understand um how money printing
[56:23] just like steals from everyone they
[56:25] don't understand the current monetary
[56:26] system at all much less Bitcoin so I
[56:28] sell that Vision too but it's we're in
[56:31] this really hard part of like
[56:33] understanding Bitcoin because you sell
[56:34] that vision and then you see these huge
[56:36] upswings in in the Bitcoin price and
[56:39] people are like Okay cool so I could
[56:41] just lose all my money like you did
[56:44] tomorrow what are we doing and it's
[56:47] really the only way to educate is to to
[56:49] find someone that like actually has a
[56:51] problem find a way that Bitcoin solves
[56:52] it because most people are not actually
[56:55] interested in learning about finance and
[56:57] money they just want to put their money
[56:58] away and see it grow just like we want
[57:00] them to with Bitcoin which is the most
[57:02] frustrating thing because it's this is
[57:04] exactly what you want but you don't see
[57:07] it that way you see the booms and busts
[57:09] you see it as risk when ultimately it's
[57:11] this super um safe asset that's just not
[57:13] going to change and um Game Theory wise
[57:16] there's it's a pretty hard to argue
[57:19] against its adoption
[57:21] so like
[57:23] I man when I when I get people curious
[57:26] I'm just like get a little bit and uh
[57:28] hold it there watch the price every once
[57:30] in a while you know um if anything if
[57:32] you're going to keep buying I just
[57:34] always dollar cost average like don't
[57:36] get the lumps some stuff that's how I
[57:37] got in trouble dollar cost averaging
[57:39] would have made me totally fine um but
[57:43] just sit on it because I know how long
[57:45] it takes to educate yourself about
[57:46] Bitcoin and I know that you're not going
[57:49] to do it unless you're actually
[57:51] motivated to do it yourself no one can
[57:53] No One's Gonna like like you said you
[57:56] told me that you were trying to prove
[57:58] your friends wrong motivation and you
[58:00] spent a whole weekend just diving into
[58:02] it and by the end you were convinced
[58:03] about Bitcoin that's pretty rapid um a
[58:06] lot of people are not going to spend
[58:07] that much time so it's like this I need
[58:10] you to find a way to have this slow you
[58:13] can just like slowly learn about Bitcoin
[58:15] and I think the the first thing is just
[58:16] have a little bit have your money
[58:18] invested whether it's like you know 50
[58:21] bucks $100 whatever it is like you've
[58:23] been hearing me rattle on about this if
[58:25] if you're willing to do that I think
[58:26] eventually maybe you get into it and
[58:30] like unfortunately it's probably going
[58:32] to be when the price starts going up um
[58:34] but so you won't get the price that you
[58:37] would get now but ultimately like you
[58:38] should DCA anyway so I don't know I mean
[58:42] we're still so early to
[58:43] bitcoin that it doesn't matter like as
[58:47] long as our friends get interested in in
[58:48] it eventually um over the next few years
[58:51] I think they'll they'll be fine and
[58:53] ultimately like we're in still so in the
[58:56] early adopter stage that it takes a lot
[58:58] of people that are either super
[59:01] disaffected by the current system or
[59:04] have an entrepreneurial mindset or are
[59:06] just super interested in the technology
[59:08] of
[59:08] money to really get involved or some
[59:11] outside thing that they get sucked into
[59:13] it um for a different reason then
[59:15] realize that they're into Bitcoin uh but
[59:17] like everyday average
[59:20] person I get it like you know you got
[59:22] your job you got your friends you got
[59:24] what you like to you don't want to learn
[59:25] about money and finance and I mean it's
[59:27] a failing of our education system I
[59:29] think it's on purpose but it's just the
[59:33] realistic spot we're in is that people
[59:34] don't care and they will care eventually
[59:38] and you know you just want your friends
[59:40] to care for positive reasons and not
[59:42] because something bad happened to
[59:44] them yeah I think
[59:46] the as as the pain
[59:49] grows uh in the current feared Financial
[59:53] system and that's kind of a sad thing
[59:55] but as the pain grows and we see it with
[59:57] third world countries and we see it
[60:00] where where's the adoption really big
[60:02] like Nigeria El Salvador th those are
[60:05] not the countries like Germany Austria
[60:08] America of course there are also
[60:10] bitcoiners and there is also adoption
[60:13] there and there's also people that get
[60:14] it uh but it's completely different to
[60:18] what is in the third world countries
[60:20] that actually needed a lot more and I
[60:23] and this is why I was decided to make my
[60:26] podcast in English and not in German
[60:28] because my native language is German and
[60:31] I wanted to do in English because I
[60:33] wanted to be able to talk with African
[60:36] bitcoiners and I already had free on I
[60:38] wanted to talk with uh bitcoiners all
[60:41] over the world to get a different views
[60:43] uh on the podcast and learn about learn
[60:46] about that and so so so important to to
[60:49] get so many different uh views also in
[60:52] there um we having an end routine and
[60:55] the time flies by really quickly in this
[60:58] podcast I think uh we having an end
[61:00] routine in the podcast where the
[61:02] previous guest asks a question for the
[61:03] next guest uh and it's an it's an
[61:06] interesting experiment sa that question
[61:10] nobody can give you an exact answer uh
[61:12] but it's an interesting F experiment
[61:14] also do the scarcity of Bitcoin um how
[61:18] many coins do you think will be lost in
[61:20] the year
[61:22] 2130 and can those coins uh technically
[61:28] uh ever be
[61:31] recovered interesting you had a a
[61:33] technology person before me U I'm very
[61:36] much a a low Tech thinker when it comes
[61:38] to bitcoin um I mean it's obvious that
[61:41] the it seems obvious that most of the
[61:44] coins that have been lost um like ever
[61:48] will have been lost in the past right
[61:49] now in 2030 I'm pretty bullish on the
[61:53] development of
[61:55] of the store of um wallet technology of
[61:59] adopting Bitcoin and like a little bit
[62:02] more fail safe so it's a like I mean the
[62:04] fact that like we write down 12 or 24
[62:06] words and that's our wallet is is great
[62:08] like I mean there's a lot of use cases
[62:09] for it but ultimately it's like it's
[62:11] super stone age compared to what I
[62:13] expect us to get to so sure I think
[62:18] Bitcoin will be lost those days but like
[62:21] it's going to be more in the order of of
[62:23] coins or maybe hundreds of coins um as
[62:27] opposed to anything else because I think
[62:30] we're just going to be so much better at
[62:31] storing Bitcoin um keeping M keeping
[62:34] hold of it and it has so much more value
[62:37] especially by 2030 it has so much more
[62:39] value that there's so much more
[62:40] incentive to keep it going where like
[62:42] most of the coins lost were when Bitcoin
[62:45] didn't really have much value people got
[62:47] it maybe it dropped there was no like
[62:50] obvious path to bitcoin succeeding back
[62:52] then for a lot of people so they just
[62:54] forgot forgot about it got a new
[62:55] computer whatever it was and with
[62:58] Bitcoin entering like the the global
[63:00] monetary stage um as a Global Payments
[63:03] Technology that's actually being adopted
[63:05] around the world um and has a ton of
[63:07] value stored in it I I just don't really
[63:09] see much Bitcoin being lost in the
[63:11] future yeah Al things like most people
[63:14] that lost Bitcoin till now obviously
[63:17] there's uh um exceptions to it but most
[63:20] people that lost Bitcoin it's because
[63:22] they bought it or min when it was like
[63:25] one year uh and and then they forget
[63:29] about it they saved it on some uh laptop
[63:31] or something like that and uh they threw
[63:34] away the laptop not thinking about the
[63:36] Bitcoin on there something like that
[63:38] obviously you're right the as the value
[63:40] grows on on bitcoin more and more people
[63:43] are like oh how do I take care of the
[63:45] Bitcoin because they're actually worth a
[63:47] lot of of of uh Financial energy however
[63:51] you want to measure it um before before
[63:54] we end the podcast uh where can people
[63:57] uh find you the best where can people
[63:58] get in touch with you is there anything
[64:01] uh you want to to add to our
[64:04] conversation in the
[64:06] end so I make natural wine and ship it
[64:10] all over the United States my website is
[64:13] pyan wine.com p n y l NE wine.com give
[64:20] me a shout on Twitter at benj Justman um
[64:22] currently what I'm really working on
[64:23] what I'm really excited about is a
[64:25] project I started in 2021 when I was
[64:28] really just into the throws of Bitcoin
[64:30] was um I made all my wine and throughout
[64:34] that process I was just watching each
[64:36] Barrel because there's a
[64:38] pretty wild differentiation um in taste
[64:42] between each Barrel um I mean like if
[64:44] they're all CSS like they're still all
[64:46] CSS but within that there's a a more
[64:49] fluctuation than You' expect and
[64:52] so back then I I picked out the best
[64:56] barrel of my wine in the entire seller
[64:59] it ended up being a a Cabernet soeno
[65:01] 2021 and picking out that best Barrel
[65:04] bottled it all it's about it's 210
[65:06] bottles and I'll be selling it as my
[65:09] Bitcoin wine sat Toshi's preserve so
[65:13] keep an eye out for that that's what I
[65:15] probably will have coming up when this
[65:16] comes out um really exciting for me
[65:19] because it's I've got Bitcoin on my
[65:22] labels um
[65:24] I you know sell wine for Bitcoin it's
[65:26] all fun but like I've never done
[65:27] anything that's specifically a wine
[65:30] bottle meant for bitcoiners no one who's
[65:32] not into Bitcoin is going to buy this
[65:34] wine realistically so it's been a wow
[65:38] almost three years coming to get this
[65:40] project to fruition and it's it's really
[65:42] exciting to be nearing the the final
[65:44] steps of it and be releasing it to the
[65:46] world I'm so looking forward to the to
[65:48] the launch of it unfortunately I'm not
[65:50] in the US but actually I know for a fact
[65:54] that uh because I have sponsors and I
[65:58] tracka links 70% of of listeners and
[66:02] viewers that watch all my content are
[66:04] actually coming from the United States
[66:06] so I think the podcast is uh podcast
[66:08] audience is highly likely that there are
[66:11] some people from the US sitting here in
[66:14] front of the screen and watching that
[66:15] and I highly recommend uh checking the
[66:18] wine out and maybe I'm coming to uh
[66:20] United States wants to to check out the
[66:22] wine in in some some area um thank you
[66:26] Ben to be on and it was great having
[66:30] you awesome thanks for having
[66:33] [Music]
