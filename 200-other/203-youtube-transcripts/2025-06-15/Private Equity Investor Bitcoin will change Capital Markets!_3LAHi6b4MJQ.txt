[00:00] the only reason we have money in the
[00:01] first place is to solve The Coincidence
[00:03] of once you know we're not going to
[00:04] trade chickens for houses or trade
[00:07] apples or meat people use Bitcoin as a a
[00:09] long-term strategic tool people aren't
[00:11] just chasing this one asset class that
[00:13] makes the most money there's like a more
[00:15] clear and even demand for things because
[00:17] there's not this mispriced cost of
[00:20] capital which then sends private Equity
[00:22] investors and those with the wealth to
[00:24] like aggressively Attack One Thing
[00:26] should you go work in private Equity
[00:27] it's insanely competitive for small
[00:29] businesses they have probably the
[00:30] greatest opportunity because they're
[00:32] lean they can make fast decisions and
[00:34] they can capitalize before Nation Stakes
[00:36] larger corporates do Bitcoin is
[00:37] increasing the hurdle rate whenever
[00:39] you're a CEO you have to be damn good at
[00:42] sales and operations in order to just
[00:45] like aggressively get something off the
[00:46] ground it also allows you to build
[00:48] something that is worth far more so
[00:50] equity in a company is often how people
[00:52] build well I would recommend learning
[00:54] some of the most valuable skills for
[00:56] business and you can go get jobs doing
[00:58] this today either sales marketing or
[01:00] operations if you believe in yourself
[01:02] and your ability you're likely going to
[01:03] reinvest in the business because you
[01:05] will outpace Bitcoin one thing about
[01:07] bitcoiners is they are disagreeable so
[01:09] could they be on a board and like work
[01:10] through tough decisions I would say
[01:12] [Music]
[01:15] yes we have an interesting topic uh you
[01:18] you just Ed it right now and it was
[01:20] really interesting for me because we
[01:22] have this notion in Bitcoin that you
[01:24] just buy and you huddle um but in order
[01:28] to buy Bitcoin you also need
[01:30] you need cash flow you need income you
[01:32] need something to buy Bitcoin with right
[01:34] uh so either you accept in your business
[01:37] or in in your job um Bitcoin and you get
[01:40] paid to for for Bitcoin or you acquire
[01:44] something else that you can sell for
[01:45] Bitcoin like feat or whatever so um talk
[01:49] to me like why it makes sense to invest
[01:53] in businesses in your own uh knowledge
[01:55] in your own business uh to accelerate
[01:58] and uh not not forever but increase your
[02:01] wealth yeah yeah um so yeah thanks for
[02:05] having me on um on that topic um we
[02:08] often hear on Twitter is just you know
[02:10] buy a Bitcoin and huddle right like
[02:12] makes total sense because it goes up
[02:14] quickly um but there's one thing to
[02:16] consider is the fact that you know the
[02:19] only reason we have money in the first
[02:21] place is to solve The Coincidence of
[02:23] once you know we're not going to trade
[02:25] chickens for houses or trade apples for
[02:28] meat because the apples will go bad you
[02:30] know the chickens will never Outlast um
[02:32] or be worth more let's say than the home
[02:35] unless you literally turn that large
[02:37] acquisition of manyi chickens into your
[02:39] own farm so it's like how do we how do
[02:41] we conduct trade and that's why we have
[02:43] money and you know we all know Bitcoin
[02:45] is the best form of money so
[02:47] for there's two types of listeners I
[02:49] would imagine right now that I want to
[02:51] speak to specifically there's the
[02:52] Bitcoin holder who's been buying and
[02:54] acquiring for a long time and they have
[02:55] a substantial amount and every new
[02:57] amount of Bitcoin they're adding to
[02:59] their stack isn't necessarily moving the
[03:01] needle tremendously so these are larger
[03:04] holders people who built a quality
[03:06] amount of wealth then there's also the
[03:08] business owner who has the cash flow and
[03:11] they think I want to sustain my business
[03:13] you hear Michael sailor talk about about
[03:15] this and other folks where you want to
[03:16] have a long-term capital preservation
[03:19] strategy which can you know allow you to
[03:21] do m&a into the future or R&D and
[03:23] expansion or just sustain you during a
[03:26] challenging time but for the Bitcoin
[03:28] holder specifically
[03:30] um as you're Building Wealth in Bitcoin
[03:33] it makes sense as you're building the
[03:35] skills in your career whatever you're
[03:37] doing sales marketing operations or
[03:38] maybe you're just a key role player
[03:41] advancing those skills and taking some
[03:43] of your stack and starting or acquiring
[03:45] a business and like why does this matter
[03:48] again the only reason we have money is
[03:49] to denominate and to make trade and just
[03:52] the buying and selling of things easier
[03:54] so that we don't have to have all these
[03:56] different units of account of just items
[03:59] but it also allows you to build
[04:01] something that is worth far more so
[04:03] Equity uh in a company or equity in real
[04:05] estate is often how people build wealth
[04:08] you want to own something that produces
[04:11] cash flow or creates value for the
[04:12] market and with businesses you can earn
[04:16] quite a bit you know entrepreneurs are
[04:18] typically the people who make and own
[04:20] the most assets and have the most money
[04:22] and if you ever do want to exit like
[04:24] we're seeing now with the rise in
[04:26] popularity of acquisition
[04:28] entrepreneurship
[04:30] that's how you create some of the most
[04:31] tremendous wealth in the world so um and
[04:34] for those not familiar with acquisition
[04:35] entrepreneurship it's something that's
[04:37] been just very popularized through like
[04:39] NBA schools like Stanford over the last
[04:41] 30 years uh those with an NBA that
[04:44] understand Finance they go buy and
[04:45] acquire a business for you know maybe
[04:47] like a 3 4X multiple grow it um roll up
[04:51] other uh maybe competitors locally or in
[04:54] the arena and then go and maybe sell it
[04:56] for let's say like 8 to 10x multiple all
[04:58] while making more more than the average
[05:00] human so you make a lot more while
[05:02] you're working and then you have a big
[05:04] exit so if you do have a Bitcoin stack
[05:06] my uh compelling message is you know
[05:08] take some start or acquire a business
[05:10] and work towards providing value in your
[05:12] local Marketplace and the one kind of
[05:15] final thing I'll I'll say to kind of
[05:17] close the loop on this is there's a lot
[05:20] of I can sense like frustration among
[05:23] people about what's happening
[05:24] politically or within maybe corporations
[05:26] and the lower quality of products or
[05:28] standards
[05:30] um you know there's a lot of uh folks
[05:31] who do not like uh you know the way like
[05:34] customer experiences are going as like
[05:36] private Equity incorporation just roll
[05:38] up and buy everything and there's a
[05:40] tremendous opportunity for individuals
[05:42] with a a passion and heart to provide
[05:44] incredible customer service and to offer
[05:47] incredible high quality Goods There's an
[05:49] opportunity for you so hopefully we can
[05:51] dive into that but I'll pause there
[05:53] because I I did share quite a bit Yeah
[05:56] there there are a lot of different uh
[05:58] routes we can go through but I I like I
[06:01] like to stick with the basics first um
[06:04] why is private Equity such a great
[06:06] wealth Builder yeah private Equity is a
[06:09] great wealth Builder I mean one thing in
[06:12] particular is you're raising capital and
[06:15] you're able to go and do larger deals so
[06:18] one instance um is say you self fund a
[06:21] deal you just use your own money and go
[06:23] purchase a deal you're often buying
[06:25] something smaller that doesn't
[06:27] necessarily maybe have all the the
[06:28] systems or processes in place if you
[06:31] typically raise money via private Equity
[06:34] you can buy a larger deal you can bring
[06:36] on other investors you can bring on
[06:38] their expertise you can leverage
[06:40] advisors um and I think the the big
[06:43] thing that you'll just hear for those
[06:45] maybe new to this online is whether you
[06:46] buy a deal that's $1,000 or $10,000 a
[06:49] million or 10 million the process and
[06:52] things are typically the same the only
[06:54] thing you're seeing is a difference in
[06:55] zeros and when you buy something smaller
[06:58] uh it might take a lot more work so in
[07:00] real estate if you buy like one house um
[07:03] and someone doesn't rent it 0% cash flow
[07:06] where if you buy an apartment complex to
[07:08] continue on the real estate example and
[07:09] maybe you have a hundred doors you could
[07:11] lose 10% of the the renters but you
[07:14] still have 90% filled so you're not just
[07:16] going to zero immediately so there's
[07:18] economies of scale in private Equity um
[07:21] so just for a simple example we'll go
[07:23] with that interesting uh and it's it's I
[07:27] think uh bit people often con uh confuse
[07:31] also Bitcoin with wealth creation for me
[07:34] Bitcoin Is wealth preservation so like
[07:36] if you have wealth if you have Financial
[07:38] energy that you just want to keep that's
[07:41] that's Bitcoin it's just so happens that
[07:44] Bitcoin right now gets adopted by so
[07:46] many people and that's why it also grows
[07:48] uh way faster than it should be uh
[07:52] because once it's at uh like it as once
[07:55] it's matured it will not grow as quickly
[07:58] as it does now um for for people there
[08:01] are a lot of different people that are
[08:03] now listening in like the age Gap is
[08:06] enorm like from from 15 to I heard like
[08:09] 80 one 80 are like the one of the oldest
[08:12] from people that are maybe now to into
[08:15] the school and maybe people that already
[08:17] have businesses um people that are uh on
[08:21] the start of uh finding out like how how
[08:23] can I uh go ahead and make maybe a small
[08:27] business out of that um maybe start the
[08:29] people that right now don't have a
[08:31] business they have either job or
[08:33] something else um how can they uh
[08:37] leverage Bitcoin or do you encourage
[08:39] everyone to to go the route with private
[08:41] equity and and and figure at least
[08:44] figure it out or is is that is there
[08:46] some personal type that like I know just
[08:48] stick to your
[08:49] job yeah that's a good question um it
[08:52] can be very enticing to do private
[08:54] Equity I would say um four or five six
[08:57] years ago whenever I was at my last job
[09:00] I was in a a high earning Commission job
[09:02] making you know 200 250k a year and you
[09:05] start listening to Bigger Pockets which
[09:07] is like the world's biggest real estate
[09:09] podcast and you learn about becoming a
[09:11] limited partner where you just invest
[09:13] Capital with these larger General
[09:14] Partners who find the deals and you get
[09:17] passive cash flow and granted I'm still
[09:19] getting passive cash flow and it's great
[09:22] but one thing I learned is it's a better
[09:24] vehicle for people with large amounts of
[09:26] wealth like if you're if you're young
[09:28] you've got you know under you know 250
[09:31] 500k I wouldn't necessarily advise you
[09:34] to just go plow it into private Equity
[09:36] um but should you go work in private
[09:37] Equity it's insanely competitive you
[09:40] know if you have a finance background
[09:41] and you want to go work under a general
[09:42] partner and learn the ropes sure but
[09:45] what should the average person do should
[09:46] you go pursue private Equity probably
[09:48] not what should you do I would recommend
[09:51] learning some of the most valuable
[09:52] skills for business and you can go get
[09:54] jobs doing this today either sales
[09:57] marketing or operations whenever you're
[10:00] a CEO you have to be damn good at sales
[10:03] and operations in order to just like
[10:05] aggressively get something off the
[10:06] ground but if you join an established
[10:08] company um you really can be great at
[10:11] sales or marketing and Thrive and make a
[10:12] ton of money sales is one of the best
[10:14] jobs to earn a high commission and learn
[10:15] the ins and outs of the business and um
[10:18] for the operations piece it's at the
[10:19] core of every business like helping
[10:22] thread things together you know you got
[10:23] The Visionaries that just blaze a trail
[10:25] and they do things their own way that
[10:28] person doesn't necessarily bring bring
[10:29] like organizational and operational
[10:31] excellence across an organization to
[10:33] people like every Trailblazer needs
[10:35] someone who can process things and
[10:37] standardize it so that an organization
[10:39] can function and that's where like you
[10:41] can build one of those three skills and
[10:43] and truly Thrive and do well in the
[10:45] business world and by learning those
[10:47] skills lastly if you can begin to really
[10:50] understand and and just grock some of
[10:51] those and begin mastering them it gives
[10:53] you the tool set to either acquire a
[10:56] business that maybe lacks one of those
[10:58] skills where you can bring value and
[10:59] improve it or you can start a business
[11:02] that's in your realm of Competency and
[11:04] you can start very lean one of the best
[11:06] things about you know starting a
[11:07] business now day versus 20 years ago is
[11:10] you've got the internet you can get
[11:11] going very easily with digital assets
[11:14] you can spin up near cheaper for free
[11:16] and launch your business online or
[11:19] locally like very quickly so do you see
[11:22] any um gaps in the Bitcoin industry
[11:25] where like oh those are interesting
[11:28] avenues that business potential business
[11:30] owners can go through in the Bitcoin
[11:32] landscape I mean we have Hardware wallet
[11:34] uh providers we have Bitcoin exchanges
[11:37] uh we have lightning wallet providers we
[11:39] have already a lot of different
[11:41] businesses especially when you go to the
[11:44] uh bigger Bitcoin conferences like
[11:45] Bitcoin prag or Bitcoin Nashville you're
[11:47] like wow there a lot of different
[11:49] companies involved and it's a big
[11:50] industry do you see anything where like
[11:52] oh this could be interesting to do in
[11:55] Bitcoin or is it more interesting to do
[11:57] something completely outside of Bitcoin
[11:59] and just leverage the private Equity to
[12:01] get to more
[12:02] Bitcoin yeah um I think there's more
[12:05] interesting things outside of Bitcoin um
[12:08] you know some of the largest and most
[12:11] well-funded companies are all exchanges
[12:14] like and I mean do you want to open an
[12:16] exchange I think is the first question
[12:17] and you know Hardware wallets right like
[12:19] Hardware companies that actually execute
[12:21] and do well are doing great so like
[12:23] exchanges like who's done well you know
[12:26] swan has done well regardless of their
[12:28] layoffs like they're core business
[12:29] functions um Unchained even though they
[12:32] do do loans like their business is is
[12:34] doing well you have river.com you got
[12:36] cash app you've got strike a lot of
[12:39] these companies are doing well and
[12:40] there're some of the ones that are more
[12:41] funded is because like the most simple
[12:43] thing you could do in Bitcoin simple
[12:45] relatively right is create an exchange
[12:47] because that's what people want Bitcoin
[12:49] for they want to buy it and then what do
[12:50] they want to do because people don't
[12:52] necessarily use it completely and
[12:55] globally fully for payments so it's a
[12:57] store value so after the exchanges
[12:58] there's wallets now or Hardware wallets
[13:02] now there's a lot of opportunity to make
[13:04] Bitcoin more spendable like what zap R
[13:07] is doing you know bring in Legacy
[13:08] payment processing and Bitcoin Payment
[13:10] Processing into one um and there's a lot
[13:13] of other businesses but I would say
[13:14] broadly for most people where I think
[13:18] most just people in the world right now
[13:20] your your skill set probably lies
[13:22] outside of Bitcoin so I wouldn't tell
[13:24] everyone like you need to come work in
[13:25] Bitcoin and you could do it because
[13:27] you're passionate about it but as far as
[13:29] as like uh upside money wealth building
[13:32] like if we're talking purely like
[13:33] business it's by far going to be doing
[13:35] something outside of Bitcoin but
[13:37] leveraging that business vehicle to
[13:39] acquire more Bitcoin I'd it and for
[13:41] those who already have uh like the let's
[13:45] switch to the side to who already have a
[13:47] business who already have some something
[13:49] going no matter how big it is um what
[13:52] can they do with Bitcoin obviously like
[13:54] accepting as a payments and putting on
[13:55] Treasury but is there is is there what
[13:58] what they F fundamentally do with
[14:01] Bitcoin yeah I think the most simple
[14:04] thing would be
[14:06] to just put excess cash flows into
[14:08] Bitcoin and Save in it um and there is
[14:11] definitely a learning curve for that
[14:13] some people get it and they just quietly
[14:14] do it some need to kind of go through
[14:17] understanding like why like why is this
[14:19] valuable um the other piece if you're
[14:22] want to step out just a bit further
[14:24] would be accepting it as payments and
[14:26] building a marketing strategy around
[14:29] accepting it as payments so one thing
[14:32] that's um happening in the world right
[14:34] now we're seeing some business owners do
[14:36] is they uh they deploy a Bitcoin
[14:38] marketing strategy to attract uh
[14:40] bitcoiners as customers so there's a
[14:43] handful of folks who have done this and
[14:44] they've done panels uh in Austin Texas
[14:47] talking about how by having a marketing
[14:49] strategy and trying to attract
[14:50] bitcoiners you have a lower cost to
[14:53] acquire a customer there's a higher
[14:55] lifetime value and these people want
[14:58] higher quality product products so I
[15:00] think it's still very early where um
[15:03] that's not just disseminated and
[15:05] everyone knows that but we're seeing it
[15:07] to be true in our space um and Beyond
[15:11] accepting it as payment and having a
[15:12] marketing strategy the other thing would
[15:14] be um creating incentives or rewards
[15:17] over Bitcoin and the lightning Network
[15:20] so since a lot of um younger folks in
[15:23] particular they uh do view Bitcoin as
[15:25] money you know they uh they they hold it
[15:28] and they want it if your business can
[15:31] bring on or on board or incentivize uh
[15:34] the younger demographic with some type
[15:36] of gameification or a reward mechanism
[15:39] there's a good chance that you will find
[15:41] success by doing that and one business
[15:43] in particular that's been doing that for
[15:45] Shopify is OSI if you're familiar with
[15:48] OSI app where um whenever you purchase
[15:50] something via a Shopify store you can
[15:52] immediately reward uh users with Bitcoin
[15:55] and what often happens is people come
[15:56] back and purchase more often
[15:59] uh lifetime values increased and um you
[16:02] can create like a a referral incentive
[16:04] mechanism so that would probably be the
[16:06] the third step so one treasury two
[16:08] Bitcoin is payment and using as
[16:10] marketing and then three would be like
[16:12] gamification or an incentive
[16:14] mechanism how big is this marketing
[16:17] effect still I mean we have big and
[16:19] small examples of that like even like a
[16:22] country like Salvador the marketing
[16:24] effect was good because all of the
[16:25] sudden everyone is talking about El
[16:27] Salvador um but this this marketing
[16:29] effect I guess will diminish over time
[16:32] as more and more businesses do it I mean
[16:34] micro strategy had a a major effect
[16:36] because were the first publicly traded
[16:38] company now many publicly traded company
[16:41] have done it um are we still early in in
[16:43] this this marketing effect or is it
[16:45] slowly already
[16:47] diminishing yeah yeah sailor talked
[16:49] about this a lot at uh Bitcoin 2024 as
[16:52] far as the nation states we are
[16:54] extremely early um and you know they
[16:57] they've in El Sal or has ingrained
[16:59] Bitcoin within their their country and
[17:01] culture and that obviously has had a
[17:03] tremendous effect for them um even their
[17:05] bonds yesterday I saw uh muy like share
[17:08] a post on like their bonds are still
[17:10] like number one which is just phenomenal
[17:11] to see now as far as companies um it is
[17:15] still early but it's far less uncommon
[17:17] like it's not common but it's it's far
[17:19] less uncommon right because we are
[17:21] seeing a lot of companies buy and
[17:22] acquire it and they do see a lot of uh
[17:26] public Equity interest of folks
[17:28] investing into the company like metap
[17:30] metap planet similar scientific micro
[17:32] strategy as you named and people enjoy
[17:35] playing that volatility um I think it
[17:38] will become normalized in the next three
[17:39] to four years where it's not going to be
[17:41] a big deal so if your company does
[17:43] acquire a Bitcoin strategy like four
[17:44] years from now you're not going to see
[17:46] like a 25% Pop in stock because there's
[17:48] going to be such a diverse amount of
[17:50] businesses that they'll probably be a
[17:53] corporate Bitcoin ETF portfolio you know
[17:55] and it'll hold like the 50 or 100
[17:57] companies that hold Bitcoin as a
[17:59] treasury strategy and then it'll just
[18:00] kind of die off but as far as
[18:03] individuals in small businesses who are
[18:05] far more lean um you know it's not
[18:08] really I don't think you could just say
[18:10] it's it's too late because we're still
[18:12] so early on the nation state and the
[18:14] corporate adoption but four or five
[18:16] years from now it may not have the same
[18:18] upside volatility will be diminished
[18:21] right so if you're not uh with if you
[18:22] don't have a ton of free cash flows it
[18:24] may not be perfect for you yet maybe do
[18:25] a half a percent or percent but four or
[18:28] five years from now you won't have
[18:29] necessarily potentially the same upside
[18:31] you know it could just rapidly change
[18:33] but for small businesses they have
[18:35] probably the greatest opportunity
[18:37] because they're lean they can make fast
[18:39] decisions and they can capitalize before
[18:41] nation states and larger corporates do
[18:43] it's so interesting for me because um
[18:45] when you mentioned it in the beginning
[18:47] and now remembered it again um when you
[18:49] have bitcoiners now hodling uh and they
[18:51] don't want to spend the Bitcoin what
[18:53] they're essentially doing is like they
[18:55] don't want to give the Bitcoin up
[18:57] because they know Bitcoin is doing some
[18:59] returns and so in order to spend Bitcoin
[19:02] you have to find an opportunity that's
[19:04] bigger than that so Bitcoin in a sense
[19:08] when you think in Bitcoin and not in US
[19:09] dollars or some other currency it's
[19:13] increasing the the hurdle rate of that
[19:16] like you you have a bigger hurdle rate
[19:18] of all of the sudden um what what can
[19:20] that do to the business World overall if
[19:23] if if Bitcoin is delivering uh as a as a
[19:26] more safe um uh vehicle um better
[19:31] returns and it's a safer way of of
[19:33] storing your wealth I mean US Dollars
[19:35] like everyone knows that you get get out
[19:36] of that and and put something in
[19:38] something else but what if we are more
[19:41] mature and more businesses have their
[19:43] cash and Bitcoin uh and it gets
[19:45] normalized that uh businesses and
[19:48] individuals hold Bitcoin does this
[19:50] increase the the hurdle rate of
[19:52] investing and new stuff and what does
[19:54] that do to the to the private equity and
[19:56] the startup world yeah
[19:59] so so I guess in like a more simple form
[20:02] you're saying like uh why would
[20:04] businesses not hold Bitcoin versus
[20:06] reinvesting in their company yeah I
[20:08] think it's it's just uh hiring the
[20:12] hurdle rate of investing your money
[20:14] because all of the sudden your money is
[20:16] not losing in value but it's it's
[20:18] increasing in value so the hurdle rate
[20:20] of of just investing in everything um uh
[20:23] is hiring and I'm wondering if Bitcoin
[20:26] if at all has an impact on on the normal
[20:29] economy of the the company economy and
[20:33] startup World maybe also when the money
[20:36] is not Soul
[20:37] free yeah yeah that's a that's a good
[20:41] question and there's like a deep answer
[20:43] so the the things that come to mind is
[20:46] when when you're a business and you're a
[20:48] private business or let's say you're a a
[20:52] 51% shareholder of a public business you
[20:55] kind of control the outcome sailor
[20:57] obviously educated every everyone got
[20:58] their Buy in he just didn't Strongarm
[21:00] the decision but if you're a private
[21:01] business you can just go all in now if
[21:04] if you're not that type of company or
[21:07] that type of decision maker you
[21:08] typically are responsible to
[21:11] shareholders um and your job is to do
[21:15] like you know a few different things um
[21:17] Lyn Alden wrote about this this week in
[21:19] her paper where you're either going to
[21:21] do research and development and improve
[21:22] on current things you might do merger
[21:24] and Acquisitions and roll up another
[21:26] company into yours you know blending two
[21:28] cultures together which is its own
[21:30] challenge to like create a better
[21:32] business or you're going to return cash
[21:35] back to investors um and you
[21:37] decapitalize the company so right now we
[21:39] are seeing a lot of uh publicly traded
[21:42] companies saving
[21:44] Bitcoin um the other thing uh about this
[21:47] though from just like let's say you're a
[21:49] small business owner and you're not
[21:51] public it it depends on your vision and
[21:54] your capability if you think to yourself
[21:56] like I don't have the capability to
[21:58] organ ically grow this and drive more
[22:00] value and increase the value of the
[22:02] business than maybe bitcoin's for you
[22:04] maybe you're like I make four 500k a
[22:07] year and I'm just going to put the rest
[22:08] into Bitcoin but there's also when you
[22:11] grow a business and it's it gets larger
[22:13] and larger it sells at a higher multiple
[22:15] because it's more sustainable so we
[22:16] brought up private Equity um you know a
[22:19] lot of companies might sell it like a 2
[22:21] three four 5x multiple sometimes higher
[22:24] if they're in high demand and then if
[22:26] you can acquire one of those or let's
[22:28] say say you have one of those and you
[22:30] say I'm going to grow it the next 5 to
[22:31] 10 years you might be able to sell it
[22:33] for a 10x multiple a 15x multiple
[22:36] whatever so what's your goal like can
[22:39] you can you save some in Bitcoin and
[22:42] reinvest in the business or are you
[22:44] going to just invest purely in the
[22:46] business and grow it and get a massive
[22:47] multiple or are you going to you know do
[22:52] something else and I think that's the
[22:53] question like if you believe in yourself
[22:54] and your ability you're likely going to
[22:57] reinvest in the business because you
[22:58] will outpace Bitcoin and if you study um
[23:03] like these acquisition entrepreneurship
[23:05] funds like the average return for the
[23:06] last 30 years has been 36% a year so I
[23:11] think there's an opportunity for small
[23:13] business owners to do a blend of
[23:15] aggressive expansion of the small
[23:16] business and The Core Business while
[23:18] having a Bitcoin strategy you can still
[23:20] do both but also over the next like 10
[23:23] years let's say like the keger on
[23:24] bitcoin instead of being in that 40 to
[23:26] 60% range you just see people kind of
[23:28] throw out um 36% is pretty close to that
[23:32] and there's some businesses that are a
[23:34] far bigger home run that exceed that so
[23:37] it really just comes down to doing like
[23:39] a personal analysis are you good enough
[23:41] to grow the business or are you not if
[23:43] you don't believe you are maybe you do
[23:44] Bitcoin if you do believe you are you
[23:46] continue to grow the business and you
[23:47] use Bitcoin as a core tool to grow The
[23:50] Core Business and I think that's going
[23:52] to become a popular strategy like uh to
[23:55] kind of wrap up my answer people use
[23:56] Bitcoin as a a long-term strategic tool
[24:00] to roll up other organizations or to do
[24:03] deeper research and development because
[24:05] if you can grow your business and saving
[24:07] Bitcoin at the same time because you
[24:08] have that much cash flow which is the
[24:10] dream you can partake in both of those
[24:13] if you watch or listen to my podcast on
[24:15] a regular basis I'll guess you already
[24:17] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[24:20] important step is to keep their Bitcoin

[25:28] and last but not least I have something
[25:30] completely new for you guys I partnered
[25:34] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[25:37] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[25:40] saw created by anyone look at that
[25:43] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[25:45] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[25:48] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[25:52] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[25:54] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[25:58] make sure to check out the link in the
[26:00] description for this amazing coin
[26:02] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[26:04] amazing I love them so much it was
[26:06] really hard for me to pick the one that
[26:08] I want to have because there are a lot
[26:10] of great options I went with the new
[26:13] transparency Edition they're all limited
[26:16] so grab yours those will not be
[26:19] available for a long time but there will
[26:21] come new models and new amazing designs
[26:24] along the way there's something really
[26:26] interesting on my mind right now um when
[26:28] when we have let's let's take the normal
[26:32] people that don't build businesses and
[26:34] don't invest in private equity and don't
[26:37] play uh this private Equity game um and
[26:40] they are
[26:41] investing right now mostly in ETFs um
[26:45] maybe they have some some other small
[26:47] things but the vast majority at least in
[26:50] on Austria what I see they have either
[26:52] real estate or they have ETFs or they
[26:55] have some some other force that they
[26:57] Bank advis tells them to it's a it's a
[27:00] big chunk of our economy that the the
[27:03] the normal people just invest whatever
[27:05] they have in whatever the bank advisor
[27:07] says to them um which kind of pumps up
[27:11] for one the real estate price uh and for
[27:14] out of the ETFs and the stock price can
[27:17] Bitcoin uh when Bitcoin sucks up more
[27:19] and more of the financial energy of gold
[27:22] of uh of real estate of the stock market
[27:25] uh because uh um companies save Bitcoin
[27:29] individual Sav in Bitcoin could that
[27:31] bring those multiples uh actually down
[27:34] on on stocks or are those multiples on
[27:37] stocks and private equities something
[27:40] that has always always been there and
[27:42] will always stay there at some some
[27:45] level that's a good question I don't
[27:48] think it will necessarily like when
[27:52] Bitcoin becomes like the money I don't
[27:55] think multiples will come down in
[27:58] there'll be phases to this this is such
[27:59] a good question I think in the shortterm
[28:01] multiples will not come down I think in
[28:04] the longterm multiples will also not
[28:07] come down but in in in between like the
[28:09] shortterm and the long term there may be
[28:11] a period where there's like a flight to
[28:13] bitcoin it's it's hard to say but I
[28:15] think multiples will stay near the same
[28:18] because at the end of the day like back
[28:20] to the original thing we were talking
[28:21] about the beginning of this um chat
[28:23] together is the reason we have money is
[28:25] to facilitate trade and to allow goods
[28:27] and servic services to flow so will
[28:30] Bitcoin diminish the demand for goods
[28:33] and services no could it diminish um
[28:37] real estate and how we value it yes um
[28:41] will it uh change uh the what people pay
[28:45] for a certain business I don't think so
[28:47] because let's say there is this
[28:48] hyperbitcoinization event where like
[28:50] overnight we go from the dollar to
[28:52] bitcoin it'd be pretty catastrophic like
[28:54] people talk about this all the time like
[28:56] the money is not spread out enough among
[28:57] people
[28:58] but would it change the multiple
[29:01] probably not because the demand for the
[29:03] service is still there like I don't
[29:05] think Bitcoin is going to go from like a
[29:07] store of value to the money in such a
[29:10] swift time where multiples break I think
[29:13] what will happen is it'll slowly go from
[29:15] store value to medium of exchange and
[29:18] during that time prices become more
[29:21] stable because one thing for instance
[29:23] like over the last like year or two is
[29:26] uh acquisition entrepreneurs and private
[29:27] equity they've gone absolutely ape mode
[29:30] for like HVAC and like plumbing and
[29:33] electrician companies because their
[29:35] margins are so high and they might have
[29:36] sold for like a 3 4X multiple now
[29:39] they're selling for like 8 to 12x
[29:40] multiples and that has to do with money
[29:42] being broken right like what do we
[29:45] invest in well hvac's hot we have to get
[29:47] them because they're they're the thing
[29:49] to own well the multiple went up I don't
[29:52] think the multiples are going to come
[29:53] down but as the money is repaired I
[29:55] think things will normalize we'll see
[29:56] less volatility of certain multiples up
[29:59] right because people aren't just chasing
[30:00] this one asset class that makes the most
[30:02] money I think what happens is there's
[30:05] like a more clear and even um demand for
[30:08] things because there's not this
[30:10] mispriced cost of capital which then
[30:13] sends private Equity investors and those
[30:15] with the wealth to like aggressively
[30:17] attack one thing so you know I could be
[30:20] wrong I'm not someone who lives in
[30:22] spreadsheets all day but I just think
[30:23] from like a a pragmatic sense if the if
[30:26] the money is good not going to see these
[30:29] wild swings and multiples of certain
[30:30] industries compared to others it'll be
[30:33] purely based on what are the economics
[30:35] of this industry with sound money really
[30:38] interesting
[30:40] um where are those multiples coming from
[30:44] like if if you are an investor how do
[30:46] you assess uh uh those multiples and how
[30:49] you're like going ahead like oh let's
[30:51] put that multiple on it I mean we we
[30:53] have so many different examples of like
[30:55] oh let's put a five or like a 10x or a
[30:57] 15x and there are like high growth
[30:59] stocks that are maybe also public they
[31:01] have a crazy multile on them so like how
[31:05] do you look at those multiples I mean
[31:08] has zero to nothing with to do with
[31:10] Bitcoin but I'm very curious how you
[31:12] think about
[31:13] that yeah no that's a good question and
[31:16] I'm I'll humbly say like I'm not the
[31:18] person who is qualified to you know
[31:22] value a business like I'm not um a
[31:24] finance person by trade but the one
[31:27] thing I would say say like valuing
[31:28] things on a multiple that I've I've
[31:30] learned over the last two to three years
[31:31] as I'm like kind of growing in education
[31:34] on this is the thing that we are seeing
[31:37] and what sailor is making an example of
[31:39] in the publicly traded markets is all
[31:42] stocks are overvalued like we've become
[31:44] so heavily invested into public equities
[31:49] that we we bid them up and the multiples
[31:51] get so high because where do we put our
[31:53] money that's what I'm that's what I've
[31:56] understood so um you know where do these
[31:59] multiples come from some of it is from a
[32:01] broken cost of capital from what I
[32:04] understand and um as far as like valuing
[32:07] a business I think the short answer just
[32:10] from like a Layman's person like myself
[32:12] is you see an industry that is resilient
[32:16] you know like when it comes to homes
[32:17] where everyone's Equity is like majority
[32:20] of Americans like wealth is in their
[32:22] home what's key to a home well there's
[32:24] HVAC and AC you know we need that
[32:26] there's Plumbing if you don't fix that
[32:27] immediately your house will be destroyed
[32:29] so there's no sleeping on Plumbing you
[32:31] could live without AC for a week or two
[32:32] right but Plumbing if water gets
[32:34] everywhere you're done an electrical if
[32:36] you don't fix that there's a huge fire
[32:38] right so like if there were like three
[32:40] businesses that demand like a bigger
[32:41] multiple those would be the ones um but
[32:45] as far as deriving multiples and all of
[32:47] this like I I'm not really like someone
[32:49] who you know lives that dayto day to
[32:51] like give a good
[32:52] answer ah fair fair enough it's
[32:55] interesting how how how they come
[32:57] together like I was before Bitcoin a
[32:59] stock investor and I didn't fully
[33:01] understand what I do but uh I'm I'm
[33:03] happy I'm Bitcoin now but it was a lot
[33:05] of fun honestly and uh if Bitcoin is
[33:07] more mature I might might consider going
[33:09] back in some stocks because it was just
[33:11] really fun to to watch them um how fast
[33:14] do you think this institutional adoption
[33:16] of
[33:17] Bitcoin uh will go like we have 2020
[33:20] kind of like the start with with micro
[33:22] strategy in the publicly traded realm uh
[33:25] we had now uh I don't know if you start
[33:28] at Bitcoin 24 Nashville micro strategy
[33:30] and Bitcoin magazine announced that they
[33:32] partner up to help institutional
[33:34] adoption and and drive this um there are
[33:38] way more people now involved in this
[33:40] game and it seems like there's like Only
[33:42] One Direction and there's one company
[33:44] after another company that's coming into
[33:46] the game it's kind of hard to keep up
[33:48] with everything that's going on how fast
[33:50] do you think we had a pace at a at a
[33:53] rate where we like oh it's yeah of
[33:55] course you're company you have uh access
[33:57] cash flow of course put something in
[33:59] Bitcoin how when will this be like kind
[34:02] of the
[34:04] norm yeah so one thing that's funny um
[34:08] and this is just a anecdotal thing like
[34:11] I've worked in um like digital marketing
[34:13] and sales for small businesses my entire
[34:15] life and it's it's always interesting
[34:17] when you hear like a small business
[34:19] owner come through and it's not all of
[34:21] them but they're like I want my website
[34:22] to look like apple or they bring up this
[34:25] big company and they're trying to be
[34:26] like them and they're not even in in
[34:27] that industry people people admire and
[34:31] want to model after the biggest
[34:32] companies in the world even if they will
[34:34] number One never be like them or two
[34:36] more importantly they're not even in the
[34:37] same
[34:38] industry so how fast will adoption be I
[34:42] think the stuff sailor and like Bitcoin
[34:44] magazine are doing you know if they're
[34:45] partnering to like educate businesses
[34:48] they'll get a lot of like these smaller
[34:50] like zombie companies or like cashr
[34:52] companies that just kind of Coast by to
[34:54] make the move but I think as far as when
[34:58] everyone starts doing it is going to be
[35:00] when like two or three more like Fortune
[35:03] 500 companies do it because then other
[35:04] Fortune 500s will do it and then you
[35:07] start hitting almost like a a point
[35:09] where like the average business owner
[35:12] just won't ignore it because their
[35:13] favorite you know business influencer or
[35:15] like talking head on CNBC is doing it
[35:18] but I think we're at least like four to
[35:20] five years out you know I think there'll
[35:21] be hundreds of businesses over the next
[35:23] like year or two that do it but it'll be
[35:25] a while before it's kind of like a
[35:26] landslide like this is an obvious
[35:29] treasury asset but I think for the small
[35:31] midm Market it's very rational and it'll
[35:34] probably happen a lot we just won't hear
[35:37] about it because a lot of these
[35:37] companies don't make headlines you know
[35:40] but it it's definitely happening like I
[35:41] know a handful of business owners
[35:43] personally that have started stacking
[35:45] Bitcoin so I think it's going to be the
[35:46] stories that we do not hear where it
[35:48] really happens like just up to the right
[35:51] but as far as like headlines where it's
[35:52] like normalized and then everyone kind
[35:55] of makes it a standard practice it'll
[35:56] probably be at least another four years
[35:58] absolutely yeah I think four or five
[36:01] years is anyways a very quick time like
[36:04] if that's that actually becomes the norm
[36:06] like five years is like uh very quick uh
[36:09] to begin with where do you see uh
[36:11] Bitcoin General like do you see as as as
[36:15] uh becoming the main medium exchange
[36:17] unit of account maybe in like 20 30
[36:20] years uh obviously not in the next five
[36:22] years I think but uh how how does how
[36:25] does Bitcoin look for you in like 20 30
[36:27] years
[36:29] yeah I mean um as far as like Bitcoin
[36:31] functioning is something that can just
[36:32] be spent and used dayto Day by everyone
[36:35] um I do totally see that being possible
[36:39] and it's been debated forever like and
[36:41] we know it probably won't happen on
[36:42] layer one but all of these different
[36:44] layers like the lightning Network um
[36:47] ecash um like impediments like all these
[36:50] just different things and innovations
[36:52] that are happening all of that is most
[36:55] definitely going to happen and you know
[36:57] there's there there's other problems to
[36:59] be solved which I'm not an expert on
[37:00] mining but was listening to Bob Bernett
[37:02] talk about how there's going to be
[37:04] markets where businesses like prepay for
[37:07] Block space in the future and there'll
[37:08] be derivatives on mining and all this
[37:10] and I think a lot of these things need
[37:12] to happen in order probably for Bitcoin
[37:15] to become like the global monetary asset
[37:20] we want because a lot of these things
[37:22] like layers to payments you know like
[37:25] we've got cash we've got credit we've
[37:27] got debit we've got lending we've got
[37:30] derivatives we've got options like if
[37:32] all that stuff wasn't there I don't know
[37:34] if we'd be able to like potentially
[37:36] globally manage the risk of just like
[37:38] operating with dollars currently you
[37:41] know something would have to come down
[37:42] where we would have to have a fixed
[37:44] Supply potentially you know I don't I
[37:46] don't know but I would imagine all of
[37:47] these like systems that our world
[37:49] currently thinks in like in terms of
[37:51] derivatives options blah blah blah blah
[37:53] blah that's going to have to happen for
[37:56] the big financiers to use it and take it
[37:58] serious because that's the worldview
[37:59] they come from and will they live
[38:02] forever will they blow up that's to be
[38:03] determined by the market you know one
[38:05] thing that we've seen is when you add
[38:07] these games to bitcoin it creates issues
[38:10] because it is the first sound digital
[38:12] money but I think it's like this
[38:14] crossing the chasm where until these
[38:16] things that the financial like Legacy
[38:19] world knows until those things are on
[38:22] bitcoin they may not view it that way
[38:24] and whether or not you know me and you
[38:26] necessarily like it a lot of these
[38:28] people that control like how money
[38:30] functions they're going to want those
[38:32] things there so probably not the answer
[38:34] Maxis want to hear but I just try to
[38:36] approach it in like a a logical kind of
[38:38] pragmatic way where like I see some of
[38:40] those things needing to happen for the
[38:43] world to use it and it doesn't mean
[38:45] there can't be a Grassroots movement
[38:46] where people use it and it's top up but
[38:48] I imagine those things would need to be
[38:51] here it's so so fascinating uh I I try
[38:54] like uh I don't know if you know what I
[38:56] do and daily interview with bitcoiners
[38:58] every day and I'm always curious to hear
[39:00] like how do you imagine Bitcoin in the
[39:02] future and I've now you at 250 uh um
[39:06] podcast actually and I I try to kind of
[39:09] like summarize or like get a direction
[39:11] from all the Bitcoin as different uh
[39:14] from all the different fields of like
[39:16] people that only have 10% of the netw
[39:17] worth in Bitcoin are well on my show
[39:19] people that have 100% in their netw
[39:21] worth in in Bitcoin and only hold
[39:23] Bitcoin on the show uh and also people
[39:25] like you that have probably equity and
[39:28] and and invest in in other things so
[39:30] like I I just try to figure out uh from
[39:33] from a very broad perspective where
[39:35] could we go but it's such an interesting
[39:37] thing like I probably will'll make a
[39:40] summary and may maybe put it in an
[39:41] article or something like that it's
[39:43] really interesting all the all the
[39:45] different opinions in in one together um
[39:49] yeah when we yeah I was just going to
[39:52] say like I agree like I know the answer
[39:54] that like I shared earlier is like not
[39:56] what I would want like I would think
[39:58] that we could spend on Lightning because
[40:00] me and many other people we use
[40:02] lightning constantly and it functions
[40:03] fine like I don't have issues with it
[40:06] and I know um a lot of businesses are
[40:08] beginning to use it and we see them
[40:10] having success with with it at voltage
[40:12] like it creates tremendous value like
[40:14] there's some exchanges that save
[40:15] $300,000 of onchain fees a month and
[40:18] they're not even the biggest exchanges
[40:19] just by using the lightning Network so
[40:22] the amount of value businesses get from
[40:23] it and the amount of value that like
[40:25] people get from it you know I think is
[40:27] just um unfathomable but it's a it's
[40:30] again this uh it's just a big problem
[40:33] but yeah sorry what was your next
[40:35] question uh there's uh one uh last topic
[40:38] that I want to get into with you um are
[40:43] do you think uh and why do you think so
[40:45] if so you think so that bitcoiners uh
[40:48] the people that are right now actually
[40:50] getting Bitcoin and and they understand
[40:52] why it's valuable are those great
[40:54] entrepreneurs innovators founders of new
[40:56] compan are those uh the type of person
[40:59] usually to to to be great uh company
[41:02] leaders in in the future do they have uh
[41:05] when you think about the average
[41:07] bitcoiner who gets Bitcoin can they also
[41:10] figure out companies um the average
[41:12] bitcoiner that gets Bitcoin can they
[41:13] figure out how to run a company I think
[41:16] they have the the Curiosity to so but
[41:20] the thing about running a business like
[41:22] versus just being a a knowledge person
[41:25] is like business does require
[41:28] intelligence and Twitter doesn't
[41:31] represent everyone in Bitcoin and good
[41:33] Lord do we know that to be true but a
[41:34] lot of people on Twitter are completely
[41:37] emotionally unintelligent they don't
[41:40] have the capability or just Vision to
[41:43] like be empathetic and lead people and
[41:46] and guide a team um but are they capable
[41:49] of it I would fully say yes because one
[41:52] thing about bitcoiners is they are
[41:54] disagreeable so could they be on a board
[41:55] and like work through tough decisions I
[41:57] would say yes you know let's not insult
[41:59] each other but the other thing is um
[42:02] they have the capability and bandwidth
[42:04] to go out and learn things that they
[42:05] don't know so if you are willing to go
[42:08] learn something and like Master a new
[42:10] skill and then like put it into
[42:12] practical application like with people I
[42:15] would say totally but um you know is
[42:18] everyone meant to be a business owner
[42:19] and entrepreneur no but are they capable
[42:22] and dude does the average bitcoiner who
[42:23] goes like down the rabbit hole are they
[42:25] capable of doing it I would say so but
[42:27] there's going to be a lot of just I
[42:29] think emotional intelligence and kind of
[42:32] going above and beyond in order to do
[42:34] business because think of it this way
[42:37] once someone understands Bitcoin it's
[42:39] pretty hard to like go back but
[42:41] sometimes when you understand business
[42:43] and what it takes and the stress that is
[42:45] required to like overcome in order to
[42:47] create a successful business most people
[42:49] aren't built for that they don't want
[42:50] that they would just love to go make a
[42:51] good income so I think that's like the
[42:54] differentiator it's just it's kind of a
[42:55] personal preference to yeah it's uh
[42:58] there they interesting points first of
[43:00] all I agree 100% with you on on that and
[43:03] also with Twitter I just want to say
[43:04] that I met a lot of bit bitcoiners in
[43:08] real life that I first only met on
[43:10] Twitter uh and it seems like there's
[43:14] this one uh meme where there's like two
[43:16] dogs sparking at each other and there's
[43:18] a fence in between and then you open
[43:20] that and they're like really nice to
[43:22] each other and uh if you go to a Bitcoin
[43:25] conference or a Bitcoin Meetup it's not
[43:28] Twitter yeah Twitter I don't know
[43:30] Twitter maybe uh struck some feelings
[43:33] and emotional things inside of us that
[43:36] are not there when you meet the person
[43:38] actually in real life and uh it's it's
[43:40] good that it is that way H but to is a
[43:42] fun place and I I'm I'm less and less on
[43:46] on Twitter and more and more just in
[43:47] real life and spending time on the
[43:49] podcast and spending time in my own uh
[43:52] reply and comment section but DWI is
[43:54] still still a fun place I grew up there
[43:56] but I kind of switched to podcasting
[43:58] more and more yeah that's cool yeah when
[44:01] I was at Bitcoin 2024 it was such a a
[44:04] positive and optimistic place and it was
[44:06] really hard to like be on Twitter when
[44:07] you're there because there's like so
[44:09] much going on and you're just meeting so
[44:10] many people that are trying to like do
[44:12] incredible stuff and it was so
[44:14] refreshing and then when I came home you
[44:16] know we're back at work and then you're
[44:17] kind of on Twitter you know maybe like
[44:19] an hour a day like reading the news stay
[44:21] up to the date with what's going on it's
[44:22] just kind of draining but yeah as they
[44:25] say the meet space the real world
[44:26] meeting people is good because a lot of
[44:28] folks kind of you know they let their
[44:30] guard down and I get it people on the
[44:31] internet we are a lot like dogs because
[44:33] we've got like these digital walls in
[44:34] between us and you the algorithm is just
[44:37] trained to like make people frustrated
[44:39] especially during election season you
[44:41] know all the stuff that that's on there
[44:43] it just kind of whether or not we notice
[44:45] it it just like kind of it lingers it's
[44:47] like bubbling like a like a pop in like
[44:49] the Disney movie you know where the
[44:50] little witches over it
[44:52] like it's just like the internet tries
[44:54] to do that to you but then you get in
[44:56] person and it's just like bitcoiners are
[44:58] incredible they come from all walks of
[45:00] life they there's so many problems that
[45:02] can be solved and they're doing it so I
[45:03] agree it was that was such a good event
[45:06] to attend meet uh other bitcoiners in
[45:09] real life I think that's a a big
[45:11] learning that everyone does it took me I
[45:15] think two and a half years being in
[45:17] Bitcoin and being in the community to
[45:19] actually meet someone in real life and I
[45:22] wish I have done it so much earlier uh
[45:25] it's it's it's a great thing and and
[45:27] everyone should should uh see that
[45:30] amazing thing that can happen from just
[45:32] meeting people in real life and and
[45:34] doing that perfect then uh we have one
[45:37] last question before we get to the endro
[45:39] te that is the question that every one
[45:41] of my guests get uh what can we learn
[45:43] from you besides Bitcoin and all the
[45:45] things that you already talked about on
[45:47] the on the podcast yeah that's a good
[45:49] question um what could you learn from me
[45:50] um I guess I don't really spend too much
[45:53] time uh talking about this because I
[45:55] just do it in my uh
[45:57] job so much but um I've just I've worked
[46:01] in small business doing digital inbound
[46:03] marketing for 20 years like a I started
[46:06] a company as a kid walked door too and
[46:09] built a huge book of business you see
[46:11] grown men doing that nowadays you know
[46:13] that's like how a lot of people
[46:13] bootstrap their business um but then
[46:16] also building digital inbound strategies
[46:18] I've I've scaled um multiple businesses
[46:21] from a marketing side to like 10 to 15
[46:23] million LED uh sales organizations for
[46:26] small business um I now work in B2B SAS
[46:29] you know and I have for the last three
[46:30] years but that's not where I've spent my
[46:32] entire career um but small business
[46:34] marketing would be it and then um beyond
[46:38] that um I'm a dad you know as of three
[46:41] years ago so always happy to like you
[46:43] know talk more about uh being a father
[46:45] with folks so I'd say those are probably
[46:47] like the the two things amazing love it
[46:50] perfect then let's come to end routine
[46:52] end routine of the podcast is where the
[46:54] previous guest is asking a question for
[46:55] the next guest without knowing who the
[46:57] next guest actually is and your question
[46:59] from the previous guest uh is something
[47:02] that comes up actually a lot uh what
[47:04] does freedom mean to you and how do you
[47:07] protect that what does freedom mean to
[47:08] you and how do you protect that
[47:11] um to me I think about how
[47:14] um like God gave us uh sovereignty you
[47:18] know in my mind simple we're in the
[47:21] Garden of Eden with him uh we sinned and
[47:24] we lost the perfect world so what is
[47:26] freedom now well the lord gave us
[47:28] autonomy and Free
[47:29] Will and uh that's what Freedom means to
[47:33] me is like free will to do as you please
[47:36] it doesn't mean that evil will be
[47:37] allowed because whether it be God or man
[47:40] someone's going to hold you accountable
[47:41] whether or not it is their job so having
[47:43] Free Will and how do you protect it I
[47:46] think um the best ways to protect it are
[47:49] what we have in America now uh the
[47:51] freedom of speech the freedom of
[47:53] assembly and uh you know now that we're
[47:56] going into a digital world having
[47:58] digital protocols that can protect that
[48:00] as those things are under attack like
[48:02] you know in yesterday in the UK they're
[48:03] just like if you retweet something that
[48:05] misrepresents the government or talks
[48:07] bad about riots or whatever it's like
[48:08] we're going to do something to you it's
[48:11] like well being anonymous is pretty
[48:13] important nowadays you know I think I
[48:15] know Jordan Peterson and people were
[48:16] debating that a year ago but it's clear
[48:18] that being anonymous really matters
[48:20] having money that can't be censored
[48:21] really matters so I think it comes down
[48:24] to the the freedom of assembly the
[48:25] freedom of speech and the freedom to
[48:27] transact but you know God gave us Free
[48:29] Will and protecting that and having
[48:31] digital tools that are going to enable
[48:33] us to do that more in this digital
[48:34] world's
[48:35] important absolutely agree very cool
[48:38] thank you so much Bobby for for being on
[48:40] the show where can people when they ask
[48:42] the questions uh find you uh and where
