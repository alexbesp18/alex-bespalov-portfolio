[00:00] I'm a Bitcoin maximalist I believe
[00:01] Bitcoin is the thing that is going to
[00:04] eat up all of the other value in the
[00:06] world all of the monetary premium in the
[00:08] world we want at least a free
[00:09] competition between Bitcoin between the
[00:12] the fear currency between maybe even
[00:13] other cryptocurrencies which is fine for
[00:15] me because I feel like in every free
[00:17] market Bitcoin will win inflation is
[00:19] violent inflation is aggression against
[00:21] everyone but it's subtle and it affects
[00:23] the most the people at the lowest rung
[00:25] of the ladder who are least able to do
[00:27] something about it once you have taxes
[00:29] you cannot have democracy it's going to
[00:31] be nothing but a good thing to get
[00:33] Justin trudo out of governing that
[00:34] country I reject the dogma of the large
[00:36] religious institutions but the message
[00:39] of Christianity is very very
[00:41] good first question you told me you
[00:44] planning a new book which is always
[00:46] really exciting because I love the
[00:47] process of like condensing information
[00:49] into like a small piece of uh uh small
[00:53] piece of medium when we say it like that
[00:56] um what are you planning there and like
[00:58] maybe before that what inspired you to
[00:59] write the book sure well the book is a
[01:03] collaboration with myself and can fanol
[01:05] and knut is is honestly he's the main
[01:08] author on this project I'm I'm co-author
[01:11] I I want to insist on on that uh he's
[01:15] this is his fourth book well maybe even
[01:18] more than that if you count various
[01:20] re-releases and and all this uh but it's
[01:22] a it's a spir it's a spiritual successor
[01:24] to the book everything divided by 21
[01:26] million which is the the meme that Cano
[01:30] uh popularized or even coined came up
[01:32] with all this and the new book is called
[01:36] the inverse of clown world full title is
[01:38] Bitcoin the inverse of clown world but
[01:39] that's sort of a misdirect I don't want
[01:41] to give away the full picture but the
[01:44] idea is that the book is really about
[01:47] you the reader and the idea that what
[01:52] what we or you can do to fix clown world
[01:57] through tools like Bitcoin and other
[01:59] freedom footprint increasing
[02:01] Technologies and so to to answer your
[02:04] question about the inspiration is that
[02:05] this is about a about a two-year process
[02:08] through our show the freedom footprint
[02:10] show which started uh a little a little
[02:13] under two years ago now actually uh when
[02:16] when I got involved with cot's Publisher
[02:19] at the time and they they wanted to help
[02:21] cot start a podcast they thought he'd be
[02:24] really good at it and that's turned out
[02:25] to be true and i' had been doing some
[02:27] podcasting before I got into the bit
[02:29] coin world and I was looking for my own
[02:31] way to contribute and so I came on board
[02:35] as their producer initially but uh I I
[02:38] was I was on camera the the whole time I
[02:40] was part of the show uh and pretty
[02:42] quickly it it turned into that it was
[02:45] really just me and canot uh had a really
[02:47] good rapport and we started up this
[02:50] Freedom footprint show and we've been
[02:52] Off to the Races ever since and so this
[02:55] last couple of years of of running this
[02:58] pod has turned into a whole whole bunch
[03:00] of ideas we've distilled it down into
[03:03] it's going to be about 12 chapters it
[03:04] looks like and so if you're familiar
[03:06] with can's books before there's sort of
[03:08] uh uh semi Standalone essays that all uh
[03:13] have have some kind of interesting point
[03:15] uh and in and in this one the uh the
[03:18] essays kind of all build into each other
[03:21] and uh we're hoping that that it's uh it
[03:24] serves as a good call to action to take
[03:28] responsibility through Bitcoin to
[03:31] improve yourself and improve the world
[03:33] that's a really really cool uh concept
[03:36] of a book I actually doing the the fre
[03:38] footprint show and Bitcoin full-time or
[03:40] do you have something else also no no I
[03:43] wish I wish but uh yeah i' I've got a
[03:45] Fiat job I I work in cyber security I
[03:48] don't mind I don't mind saying that but
[03:50] uh yeah it's it's completely unrelated
[03:52] to bitcoin at the moment uh it's it's a
[03:55] it's a good job I I it's going to be
[03:57] hard to give that up while I I still get
[03:59] a good salary through something else but
[04:02] uh I wish I could direct all of my
[04:04] energy into Bitcoin that would be the
[04:07] ideal thing but right now it it makes
[04:09] sense to also keep stacking some STS
[04:11] through through some external income but
[04:13] one day uh one day the goal is
[04:15] definitely to transition into to bitcoin
[04:17] fulltime let's let's see if it's this
[04:19] cycle or next one I I love it I actually
[04:22] worked also in in in cyber security
[04:24] before till yeah till February till end
[04:26] of February like since March I'm not
[04:28] there anymore uh but
[04:30] I quite liked it there but it's it's
[04:32] it's not Bitcoin unfortunately has some
[04:35] we'll have to compare notes on that at
[04:37] some point yes um maybe let's talk about
[04:41] clown World in general clown world I
[04:42] feel like it's a um a word a phrase that
[04:48] gets thrown around a lot like it's like
[04:51] one of the phrases where like someone
[04:53] doesn't like something it's clown world
[04:55] I feel like uh It's associated with a
[04:57] lot of a lot of things uh but so has a
[05:00] lot of truths to it um what is for you
[05:03] clown like what is uh the the the
[05:05] definition of clown well for you yeah
[05:08] yeah that's a good question and I think
[05:10] as you say it's it's different for
[05:12] everyone but to me it really ends up
[05:14] being these distortions of the world
[05:18] distorted incentives that that result in
[05:21] crazy behavior people doing things that
[05:23] they otherwise wouldn't do because the
[05:25] system is set up in such a way to to uh
[05:29] make it profitable to do things that are
[05:32] either violence against your fellow man
[05:34] or just absolute craziness to avoid
[05:37] getting uh getting pillared by the mob
[05:41] it's it's it's a lot to do with Fiat
[05:44] actual Fiat uh certainly I I think
[05:46] that's the case that that the world uh
[05:50] that it that doesn't have a a fixed
[05:52] money supply is going to naturally have
[05:55] skewed incentives and it also skews the
[05:59] incentives for people to just get by in
[06:02] the world essentially so when you have a
[06:05] state able to control money right then
[06:10] then the state also is able to control
[06:12] its citizens Behavior and the the way
[06:17] that I put this myself and that we've
[06:20] written about this in the book is that
[06:22] this is this is all down to the the
[06:25] concept of praxiology or part of
[06:28] Austrian economics is entially uh where
[06:31] that if uh uh it all comes down to to
[06:34] Human Action and human behavior and that
[06:38] the only right in the world is the right
[06:41] to be left alone and all other so-called
[06:45] rights uh essentially have to violate
[06:48] the right for someone to be left alone
[06:51] eventually like for example if a
[06:54] politician were to to say that everyone
[06:56] has to get free housing okay well maybe
[07:00] you can find someone who's willing to
[07:02] build a whole bunch of houses for people
[07:04] someone who wants to to go be a a
[07:07] builder and construct houses and and
[07:09] that person wants to do that to get paid
[07:11] money to do that but someone else has to
[07:14] pay for that right So eventually someone
[07:17] has to pay someone has to be forced to
[07:19] pay or money has to be created out of
[07:23] thin air in order to pay the bill and so
[07:26] it's a subtle form of violating
[07:28] everyone's right to be left alone or
[07:30] violating everyone's right to not have
[07:32] violence done upon them right and
[07:35] inflation is inflation is violence
[07:37] inflation is aggression inflation is
[07:39] aggression against everyone but it's
[07:42] subtle and it affects the people with
[07:46] the if it affects the most the people at
[07:48] the lowest rung of the ladder who are
[07:49] least able to do something about it this
[07:51] is this is related to the uh um the I'm
[07:55] blanking uh the the the effect of those
[07:58] closest to the the money printer uh so
[08:01] yeah it all of this together contributes
[08:03] to misaligned incentives and governments
[08:07] and States able to force their
[08:10] population to do certain things skewing
[08:13] behaviors I think like incentives is
[08:15] like everything because when you have
[08:17] the incentive to do something you
[08:19] probably will do it if there is no other
[08:21] incentive there that is stronger than
[08:23] that or there's some nothing other uh
[08:26] behavior that is underlying of that so
[08:30] like with fixing the money that's that's
[08:32] a big part of of everything that is
[08:34] going on with the world um but is there
[08:37] anything that uh besides the monetary
[08:40] system because you also like kind of
[08:42] pointed out there like uh in the book
[08:44] you have Bitcoin but there's also other
[08:46] things you can do is there anything else
[08:48] that you think when you talk about the
[08:50] system that is wrong with the world that
[08:53] needs to be fixed outside of the money
[08:55] outside of the uh uh system is like
[08:58] politicians privacy is there anything
[09:01] else that you see like outside of money
[09:03] that we have to fix yeah it's it's all
[09:05] about Freedom it's all about freedom and
[09:07] the the other things than Bitcoin
[09:09] Bitcoin is one Freedom technology
[09:10] there's there's a a term that floats
[09:13] around sometimes that some people are
[09:15] identify as Freedom maximalists not
[09:17] Bitcoin maximalists I'm a Bitcoin
[09:19] maximalist that's what I believe myself
[09:22] to be I believe Bitcoin is the thing
[09:25] that is going to eat up all of the other
[09:27] value in the world all of the monetary
[09:29] premium in the world I'm a maximalist
[09:32] towards that specifically freedom
[09:34] maximalism I think is a different
[09:36] concept and I I I don't like to go out
[09:39] on a limb and say this is what I
[09:40] identify as anything other than Bitcoin
[09:43] but freedom maximalism is a good goal
[09:45] absolutely maximizing individual freedom
[09:47] is is I think what needs to be done and
[09:50] there are a few ways that that you
[09:53] anyone can can do to to increase their
[09:56] freedom footprint that's the that's the
[09:58] term we like to throw around there and
[10:00] and so one of those things absolutely is
[10:02] is privacy Technologies for for privacy
[10:05] generally things that make it so that
[10:07] people can't find information about you
[10:10] online now Bitcoin has its own privacy
[10:13] layer and there's there's been its its
[10:14] own uh there have been challenges with
[10:17] that essentially where governments have
[10:18] been saying that efforts to increase
[10:20] privacy on bitcoin are actually illegal
[10:23] and and this has being related to most
[10:25] recently the the arrest of the Samurai
[10:28] wallet developer and then Wasabi wallet
[10:31] voluntarily taking down its coin join
[10:33] service but coin joins are incredibly
[10:35] important and right now it's one of the
[10:37] only ways for for privacy to be done on
[10:39] bitcoin there there are other other ways
[10:42] for privacy on bitcoin to be possible
[10:45] the lightning Network to a certain
[10:46] extent has some some aspects of privacy
[10:50] the the L the liquid network is also a
[10:53] very good option that increases privacy
[10:56] uh if you use it a certain way in in all
[10:59] cases though it's it's just the the
[11:01] concept that no one else but you has the
[11:04] right to know how much Bitcoin you have
[11:07] where it's being spent on and and it in
[11:11] Technologies to increase the ability to
[11:13] to keep privacy uh is is vastly
[11:17] important for me so I think I think it's
[11:19] it's a tragedy that that Samurai wallet
[11:22] developers the even the tornado cash guy
[11:25] I mean the the principle is the the same
[11:28] he might have been working on ethereum
[11:30] right but but it's it's the same the
[11:33] same concept that that speech should not
[11:36] be uh banned banable right and and
[11:41] really what they're doing with with
[11:42] Banning some kind of code is is Banning
[11:44] speech and then Wasabi is is clearly
[11:46] taking the approach of uh uh
[11:48] prioritizing not going to prison over
[11:51] over having the the technology be run by
[11:53] them but but the the coin join protocol
[11:56] the wabisabi protocol is still open
[11:58] source and and coord coordinators could
[12:00] could crop up that's that's certainly
[12:01] something there and there are other
[12:03] decentralized methods of of doing coin
[12:05] join for example and uh uh other things
[12:08] such as for example I believe it's
[12:10] called Silent payments which are trying
[12:12] to do something that to to me it looks a
[12:13] little bit like how Monero works but but
[12:16] uh um it's it's not exactly the the same
[12:20] uh so so there are just lots of options
[12:22] for for privacy and increasing those
[12:25] options and doing more for that is is
[12:27] one way that will help Bitcoin from from
[12:29] from being co-opted by governments as a
[12:32] as a medium of control but there are of
[12:34] course other other ways to increase
[12:35] privacy increase Freedom another another
[12:39] interesting idea is the concept of flag
[12:41] theory in other words getting as many
[12:43] passports as possible to be able to play
[12:46] jurisdictional Arbitrage essentially so
[12:49] that if if one country or nation state
[12:52] decides they don't like you anymore uh
[12:54] that you could go to another country or
[12:57] or at least be able to travel
[12:59] somewhere else that that would would
[13:02] allow you to uh escape the long arm of
[13:05] of a nation's so-called law so and and I
[13:10] just want to say here as well I'm not
[13:11] advocating for for law breaking or doing
[13:14] doing anything illegal I I am advocating
[13:17] for that that these things should not be
[13:19] illegal privacy shouldn't be illegal and
[13:22] it should certainly be uh it would be it
[13:24] would be great if we had a world where
[13:26] where some people didn't need to have
[13:27] multiple passports but for example Katie
[13:30] the Russian and uh and uh others in sort
[13:33] of this this uh Freedom um movement um
[13:37] Lia klova I think is is is Ukrainian and
[13:40] I've met also i' met also people from
[13:42] like the Alexi Nal camp and and they all
[13:45] talk about how Bitcoin is being used for
[13:47] freedom and uh this all these people are
[13:50] kind of in this in this Camp of Bitcoin
[13:51] being used as a freedom tool and uh and
[13:55] uh Bitcoin is as uh as a way of getting
[13:58] around
[14:00] absolutely insane government controls in
[14:02] places like Russia and others and so all
[14:05] of these things together are are
[14:08] building blocks that you can use to
[14:10] build your own Freedom footprint
[14:12] something like that so I love it and is
[14:17] what I'm thinking a lot is uh the
[14:19] internet is not there since a long time
[14:21] and a lot of the Privacy aspect is there
[14:24] because of the internet uh so when we
[14:27] come with social media they want to
[14:29] listen in to WhatsApp messages and stuff
[14:31] like that it's now also popularized with
[14:33] the EU election uh here um is there a
[14:38] global war on privacy intentionally or
[14:43] are they just trying in a really bad way
[14:45] to get that internet stuff under control
[14:49] which I don't think they have to get
[14:51] under control but maybe they just having
[14:53] good intentions and they're like oh
[14:54] let's let's regulate this stuff I'm
[14:56] really against that but uh is do you
[14:58] think that like a really um um a war on
[15:01] privacy with all the stuff that going on
[15:03] or they are just trying to do the same
[15:05] thing that they are doing since hundreds
[15:07] of thousands of years just in the
[15:08] internet now well the good intentions
[15:11] thing is interesting and and I think to
[15:13] some extent good intentions are a play
[15:15] here not everyone is evil I I do believe
[15:18] that that even even people in higher
[15:21] rungs of of power in organizations that
[15:25] that some might deem evil World economic
[15:27] Forum as one example I don't believe
[15:29] everyone associated with that is is evil
[15:31] I do believe some people specifically at
[15:33] the top are this interesting
[15:36] constellation of narcism and narcissism
[15:39] and egotism and psychopathy that that
[15:41] just creates absolutely evil people who
[15:44] who want to control others and and uh
[15:47] and and do that through through
[15:49] political means or other forms of of
[15:50] holding power but that's not everyone
[15:52] and so good the good intentions part of
[15:54] this this is the interesting thing this
[15:55] is all about security and security
[15:58] always comes at the expense of
[16:00] convenience always and security is one
[16:03] of one of these things that society as a
[16:05] whole somewhat has to take together and
[16:09] that really conflicts with with an
[16:11] ideology of of individual Freedom right
[16:14] and so the the idea here is that is that
[16:18] encryption technology has been a tool
[16:21] for for people to send messages to
[16:23] coordinate to do to do acts of violence
[16:26] against other people but it is also a
[16:28] tool for for people who are being
[16:30] surveilled by their government to be
[16:32] able to communicate together without
[16:34] that government listening in right so
[16:37] all of this stuff is anyone can use it
[16:41] people can people can use these tools
[16:42] for good people can do use these tools
[16:45] for evil and maybe even just to define
[16:48] those things a little bit at minimum
[16:49] something evil is is is is something uh
[16:53] intentionally doing violence to another
[16:55] person whe and violence can mean
[16:57] physical harm it can mean taking
[16:59] possessions it can mean forcing someone
[17:02] to do someone they don't want to do
[17:03] those things are evil if if if someone
[17:06] commits violence against another human
[17:07] that's that's the beginnings of evil
[17:09] there are degrees but that's that's a
[17:12] pretty easy one I think uh and and then
[17:15] and then uh the these technologies that
[17:18] that governments want to use to to for
[17:20] example surveil people well they always
[17:22] say that there it's it's good intentions
[17:24] right if if you're not doing anything
[17:26] wrong what do you have to fear of the
[17:27] government reading your email
[17:29] right but then the government gets to
[17:32] decide who is doing something wrong and
[17:34] it's going to be arbitrary it's going to
[17:35] be someone making a decision and
[17:38] somewhere along the line there's going
[17:40] to be someone who decides that what
[17:42] you're doing isn't in the government's
[17:44] best interest or isn't in their best
[17:46] interest and and they can then decide to
[17:49] take action against the offender and
[17:52] it's it's it's like the the the quote
[17:55] they first they came for the trade
[17:57] unionist and I wasn't a trade unionist
[17:59] first then next they came for the
[18:00] Communist I wasn't a communist next they
[18:02] came for the Jews I wasn't a Jew then
[18:04] they came for me in paraphrasing and I
[18:07] probably got the order wrong but it's
[18:08] it's that's a real quote right and and
[18:12] total totalitarianism is is going to
[18:16] increase their means of control in in
[18:19] whatever way possible and and eventually
[18:23] it's going to be a society of people
[18:26] that either fully obey or people that
[18:28] are brutally brutally repressed and and
[18:32] that's not a a world I want to live in
[18:34] and and that's also not a world that
[18:36] that results in success the this is
[18:40] visible from space if if looking at a
[18:43] nighttime shot of the Korean Peninsula
[18:46] there's there's a bright South Korea
[18:49] full of lights and and and full of
[18:51] economic activity and then there's an
[18:53] almost completely black North we've been
[18:55] running an experiment on on uh communism
[18:59] versus capitalism for it's it's 70 years
[19:03] something like that over there and and
[19:04] eastn West Germany is is another example
[19:07] absolutely that's still being felt today
[19:08] that you can see in in all kinds of
[19:10] demographic lines all kinds of
[19:13] Statistics you can see the the the East
[19:16] West Germany divide literally just in
[19:18] things like percentage of population
[19:21] that votes for a certain party or
[19:22] percentage of unemployment or this and
[19:24] that you can clearly see the the divides
[19:27] there right and so this is stuff that
[19:29] echoes in eternity and it's also it's
[19:32] also a reason to prioritize individual
[19:36] freedoms and reduce the honorous
[19:39] governments that want to want to control
[19:42] and just get in the way of human
[19:45] flourishing I love that so much and
[19:47] especially when you talk about the tools
[19:50] it has could could be implemented um
[19:53] because this is the thing that I also
[19:55] think is really really dangerous with
[19:57] cbdcs uh with which is also really
[20:00] dangerous with putting in uh monitoring
[20:04] devices in whatsapps and stuff like that
[20:06] that that you now wants to do um even if
[20:09] the people now have really good
[20:11] intentions there will come a person that
[20:14] has not like even if everyone at the
[20:18] level has really good intentions they
[20:20] will die at some point there will
[20:22] someone come up and someone will be like
[20:24] oh we could also do that with that power
[20:27] uh and there will come some someone
[20:29] along that has like really bad
[20:30] intentions and misuse the technology
[20:33] that is there so why are we building it
[20:35] in the first place it's like uh if
[20:37] you're a criminal uh you might not use
[20:40] WhatsApp in the first place anyways if
[20:42] you really want to do something criminal
[20:44] you might be intelligent enough to not
[20:46] do it over WhatsApp because we have so
[20:49] many examples that WhatsApp chats has
[20:51] been leaked so why why do we do WhatsApp
[20:54] anyways uh so that those are some some
[20:56] questions that I ask myself um about
[20:59] flag Theory I have one more question
[21:02] that you brought up flag Theory it's
[21:04] really interesting for me uh Austria has
[21:06] I know of does not allow actually a
[21:08] second uh passport at the moment I know
[21:11] that there are two I think two political
[21:15] part that parties that actually um
[21:17] fighting for that that you have can have
[21:18] a second one um what like when you uh
[21:23] think of a second passport um do you
[21:25] have any favorite nation that you are
[21:27] looking at like is like
[21:29] El Salvador now a really um popular
[21:32] thing for you where like okay there
[21:34] could be something really interesting or
[21:35] do do you look at any other nations that
[21:37] you like I want the second passport from
[21:40] that
[21:41] Nation well so this is an interesting
[21:43] question and again this is going to
[21:44] differ for for everyone for myself
[21:46] personally I'm working on my own second
[21:48] passport I'm from Canada originally but
[21:50] I've I've uh migrated to Finland in the
[21:53] last few years and and So eventually I
[21:56] hopefully I'll have uh passports from
[21:58] two of the the most uh
[22:00] statist regimes in the in the the whole
[22:03] world but thankfully they're both
[22:04] they're both relatively free by other
[22:07] measures so I'm allowed to say that but
[22:09] yeah can Canada and and and the EU both
[22:12] together maybe maybe either of them on
[22:15] their own might might be a little bit of
[22:17] cause for concern but both but having
[22:19] having both together I think is going to
[22:20] be good and and in all seriousness I I
[22:23] intend to live in in Finland if I
[22:24] possibly can it's it's a great place to
[22:26] to live but that doesn't mean mean that
[22:28] having Alternatives isn't isn't going to
[22:30] also be on my mind there it's
[22:33] unfortunate when jurisdictions don't
[22:34] allow multiple passports but it also is
[22:38] sort of a a unitary thing like it's it's
[22:41] who who who knows about that right uh in
[22:45] in in some cases it comes down to that
[22:47] what would the the country do if you if
[22:50] you got to Second citizenship I think
[22:52] India as an example that that really
[22:56] understands when someone gets another
[22:58] citizenship and then they they make
[23:00] their overseas citizens become sort of a
[23:03] different status that's it's still sort
[23:05] of a citizen of of India but it's it's
[23:07] it's a different status I don't know the
[23:09] exact details but I've I've I've met
[23:11] people that have been making this
[23:13] decision uh and and and so I mean it's
[23:16] unfortunate when that's the case uh but
[23:18] but for for me I I don't have that that
[23:20] issue both both uh Canada and Finland
[23:23] allow the the dual citizenship and so
[23:25] that's nice El Salvador you mentioned El
[23:27] Salvador that's that's uh yeah that's a
[23:28] big one for bitcoiners of course and El
[23:31] Salvador is really trying to attract a
[23:33] lot of talent and and in fact this is
[23:35] this has been uh an area of a bit of
[23:37] controversy that El Salvador for example
[23:40] NAU K the president there suggested that
[23:43] that maybe they would give 5,000 visas
[23:46] to top scientists doctors philosophers
[23:50] uh and and they would they would just
[23:52] select some of the best of the best but
[23:53] there was some there was some backlash
[23:55] in terms of that sort of these people
[23:57] are kind of skipping the Q so to say and
[24:00] and uh coming in in in in front of
[24:03] people who might not have these these
[24:05] same qualifications and I I don't really
[24:07] have any concerns with that in fact I
[24:08] think an arms race for countries to
[24:10] attract absolutely the best talent
[24:12] possible is is the way to go here Canada
[24:15] has a problem with keeping doctors in
[24:17] the country uh the the the there are a
[24:21] lot of things set up that make that make
[24:24] it that Canadian doctors don't earn a
[24:25] lot of money it's a fully Public Health
[24:27] Care system and so doctors can have
[24:30] their own practices and they can set up
[24:32] corporations to be uh to be private
[24:35] practitioner doctors but they they still
[24:37] have to go through the same Billing
[24:38] System and offer the the same
[24:41] things so so in other words the the
[24:44] Canadian Health Care system is is
[24:46] basically just a complete Fiat machine
[24:50] and so doctors have a limit on on what
[24:51] they can earn they're not making they're
[24:53] not making millions in Canada maybe
[24:55] they're making hundreds of thousands but
[24:56] then they have to pay all their cost for
[24:59] uh for their overhead for their offices
[25:02] for any any administrative employees
[25:04] assistants things like that and so they
[25:07] they they make a a living but they
[25:09] they're not getting extremely wealthy
[25:11] but the way that that this is uh that
[25:14] they get taxed is essentially through uh
[25:16] capital gains tax through their
[25:18] corporation so the the money that has
[25:22] been paid into a doctor uh in in Canada
[25:25] that sits in their corporation the
[25:28] doctor Corporation and then they
[25:29] withdraw it to to create a salary uh
[25:33] essentially but that money then gets
[25:35] taxed on any capital gains income uh uh
[25:39] at the point of uh at the point of
[25:42] withdrawing it and the Canadian
[25:44] government Justin Trudeau is just
[25:45] increasing that that it's it's going to
[25:48] go from a a
[25:49] 50% taxation rate to a 66% taxation rate
[25:53] now I don't I don't mean that that I
[25:54] don't get me wrong that's not that it's
[25:56] taxed 50 to 66% it's that uh 50% was
[26:00] eligible for Taxation and now 66% is
[26:03] eligible for taxation so there was in
[26:05] other words there was an incentive to to
[26:07] have this structure that not all the
[26:09] money was was actually taxed uh but the
[26:12] the amount of money that that doctors
[26:15] now specifically get to take home is
[26:17] going to be far less and so Canada's
[26:19] already been having a problem attracting
[26:21] doctors well why don't those doctors go
[26:23] move to El Salvador or some other
[26:25] country that's going to let them keep
[26:26] more of what they earn right and and so
[26:30] El Salvador wanting to take in so many
[26:33] of the best people so that they can
[26:35] create a wonderful Society full of smart
[26:39] people ambitious people that want to
[26:41] improve life and the life of those
[26:44] around them I mean that's great and I
[26:46] hope that this arms race intensifies and
[26:49] that countries compete for for their top
[26:51] talent and at the moment the the Western
[26:54] World sort of isn't doing that there
[26:57] there there are are of course uh
[26:59] incentives for people to immigrate into
[27:01] into certain countries but the Taxation
[27:03] regimes and uh the the rules and
[27:06] regulations in Western countries are
[27:08] just so
[27:09] high that that if it weren't for the the
[27:12] quality of life and the welfare state of
[27:14] of Western countries well I would see no
[27:17] incentive to to immigrate to one of
[27:20] those
[27:21] places and just going to a a a place
[27:25] where there is less regulation and less
[27:27] taxation would would make a lot of sense
[27:29] but the decision to move somewhere
[27:31] anywhere is is a complicated one the the
[27:35] Top Line sort of uh flag Theory places
[27:38] that basically sell passports for some
[27:41] amount of money Antigua I believe is the
[27:44] is the one that uh um Katie the Russian
[27:47] and and uh her organization they they
[27:51] that's the one advertised I think it's
[27:52] the lowest cost one at the moment but
[27:55] there are others usually it's some
[27:57] amount of hundreds of thousands or maybe
[27:59] even millions of of dollars Euros take
[28:02] your pick usually it's denominated in in
[28:04] US Dollars golden visas is is sort of
[28:07] what they're called and and so if you
[28:09] have the the wealth to be able to to get
[28:13] uh passports for yourself and your
[28:15] family at one of these other countries
[28:17] usually the usually it's not even a case
[28:19] of wanting to go live in that
[28:21] jurisdiction but it's also just a
[28:23] passport that's internationally
[28:25] recognized and you can go travel to to
[28:27] other places through that as well uh
[28:29] it's it's a rainy day uh situation even
[28:32] though maybe it's it's quite nice to go
[28:34] uh move and or spend some some time in
[28:37] an Antigua or other Caribbean islands or
[28:40] islands in the uh Pacific or or or
[28:42] something like that that's usually where
[28:44] they are but uh Portugal specifically
[28:46] has has had some golden V Visa
[28:48] incentives and there there's other
[28:49] places in in uh in the world that that
[28:51] offer these things so it's all about
[28:54] finding the the right one but uh there
[28:57] there are a lot of a lot of options and
[29:00] it's going to be an individual Choice
[29:02] compared to anyone I'm good with my uh
[29:04] my second passport from Finland for now
[29:06] but maybe in a few years I'll be looking
[29:09] at uh a third maybe El Salvador on the
[29:11] menu there and and I feel like we seeing
[29:15] the sovereign individual and other
[29:17] similar books playing out in real time
[29:19] when we have uh upcoming Nations like El
[29:22] Salvador when you look at it like 2020
[29:25] or 2019 uh High murder rate uh tourism
[29:30] was uh not high it was like uh not a
[29:33] good country to live in it was like
[29:35] starting from a really low Place uh
[29:37] except maybe from the surfing aspect of
[29:39] it uh but now they are like climbing the
[29:42] ladder a little bit and they're going in
[29:44] at least in the right direction let's
[29:45] see how it it turns out in the next like
[29:47] five 10 years then you have countries
[29:50] like Canada uh that did quite great or
[29:54] but in the last couple of years you kind
[29:56] of see where this is going um it's it's
[30:00] it's interesting to see how this plays
[30:02] out especially now when we have more and
[30:04] more remote work we have more and more
[30:06] uh possibilities even with Bitcoin you
[30:08] can like just store your uh wealth in
[30:10] your head and go over borders and you I
[30:14] don't want to encourage anybody to break
[30:15] loss but you could do it quite easily
[30:18] and just go over borders if if you know
[30:20] how to do it uh so that's that's really
[30:23] interesting how the the sheeps get wings
[30:26] and then can fly to other borders
[30:28] without being interrupted too much it's
[30:30] like that's how I see
[30:32] it yeah exactly and I mean the the funny
[30:35] thing there with Canada is that it's
[30:37] it's really just been a case of I I
[30:38] think I think Canada has been too nice
[30:41] and and there's there's a desire among a
[30:43] large part of the the Canadian
[30:45] population to just be nice to everyone
[30:48] and and take care take care of people
[30:50] it's it's over an overactive empathy
[30:52] gland and and I think the the results of
[30:56] this have been that the Canadian
[30:58] governments do more and more and more
[31:00] for the the populace but that all has to
[31:03] come at the expense of higher and higher
[31:05] taxes and printing more money and the
[31:08] the covid pandemic was was seriously not
[31:11] good for the the money supply in Canada
[31:14] and it just ballooned and I I left
[31:17] during the the pandemic but I the
[31:20] economic Times in Canada had been bad
[31:21] for for quite a long time especially
[31:23] western Canada where I'm from it's it's
[31:25] an oil and gas heavy region where the
[31:27] the economy is is heavily based in oil
[31:29] and gas but it's it's it's done in in
[31:32] some of the the best way in the whole
[31:34] world the safety standards and the
[31:35] environmental standards are are the best
[31:37] in the world over there and so it was
[31:39] oil and gas being produced ethically and
[31:41] you know and it's it's it's a commodity
[31:43] that is needed energy is needed there's
[31:45] no such thing as a low energy high
[31:48] wealth country it's it's high wealth
[31:50] high energy that's that's what happens
[31:53] and if you're low energy or low wealth
[31:55] that's just the the equation and
[31:58] so in in Canada Justin Trudeau demonized
[32:02] the oil and gas industry and and put in
[32:06] countless measures I mean really quite a
[32:09] lot to to make it more difficult to
[32:13] produce oil and gas at competitive rates
[32:17] competitive prices and so uh carbon tax
[32:21] is is another one as well and I mean
[32:23] that's that's just there are many bad
[32:26] taxes but a carbon tax is is really
[32:28] quite ridiculous um but but the the
[32:32] results of this was that was that the
[32:34] Western Canadian regions were were
[32:36] starting to do quite poorly
[32:38] economically especially when when when
[32:41] oil is down those regions do do poorly
[32:44] but but usually it bounces back fairly
[32:47] quickly because the commodity prices
[32:49] eventually even out but but this time
[32:52] this started back in roughly 2016 it was
[32:54] just a long period of time where where
[32:57] the government was against a region of
[33:00] its of its own country and and the
[33:03] economic Times there were were just
[33:05] rough anyone could lose their job at any
[33:08] moment and and there was no such thing
[33:10] as job security there was really no no
[33:14] under no no ability to plan for the
[33:16] future uh be because because everyone
[33:20] just had had had to worry about uh
[33:23] having the next job lined up or or other
[33:26] things like that it was really quite
[33:28] stressful and I I tried to get myself
[33:30] out of working in industries that were
[33:33] directly tied to oil and gas I I moved
[33:36] into cyber security from from some other
[33:38] stuff that was more directly related to
[33:39] the oil and gas industry myself uh and
[33:42] that was one attempt to do that but when
[33:44] I got the opportunity to move to to
[33:46] Finland after uh this was in about 2021
[33:49] uh I I I took it it was an adventure uh
[33:53] lot of uncertainty there but I've I've
[33:56] loved it and and and definitely it
[33:59] wasn't the only the only reason I moved
[34:01] wasn't just the economic situation in
[34:04] Canada but it was big factor and the the
[34:09] result is that it's only gotten worse
[34:11] since since I've left inflation in
[34:13] Canada is is absolutely brutal food
[34:16] prices are are through the roof the
[34:18] money supply something like doubled I
[34:20] believe since since 2021 or maybe 2020
[34:23] and yeah Canada Canada just has
[34:26] incredibly poor government government is
[34:28] to to blame for it and there's going to
[34:30] need to be a lot of work done to to fix
[34:34] that and maybe truthfully Canada can't
[34:37] be fixed in its in its current form I I
[34:39] would not be surprised to see Canada
[34:41] segment into more than one country but
[34:44] thankfully there are a lot of good
[34:45] people in in Canada good bitcoiners who
[34:48] are working towards increasing Bitcoin
[34:51] adoption in Canada and and doing lots of
[34:54] good things over there um the the guys
[34:57] at bu Bitcoin I think are are very
[34:59] specifically uh heavily involved and
[35:02] well known internationally that's like
[35:03] Francis pulio Dave Bradley madx if
[35:06] you've seen his art uh lots of great
[35:08] stuff going on there so uh yeah I'm I'm
[35:11] somewhat optimistic for Canada it
[35:14] because of people like that but I I do
[35:16] think in the the short to medium term
[35:18] there's going to be more pain there
[35:20] unfortunately if you're listening to
[35:22] this podcast you might be wondering what
[35:24] is actually the setup look like of Robin
[35:26] or how can I improve my Bitcoin setup
[35:29] and there's two things you have to buy
[35:31] Bitcoin from the right source and you
[35:32] have to store Bitcoin the right way
[35:35] let's focus on the first thing how to
[35:37] buy Bitcoin it's simple have a Bitcoin
[35:39] only exchange don't deal with the
[35:41] shitcoin exchanges don't deal with an
[35:43] exchange that has an own token or
[35:45] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[35:47] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[35:50] for me the best partner for that and now
[35:54] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[35:56] should be stored on a high Hardware
[35:58] wallet on a self custody solution where
[36:01] you yourself hold your keys and it
[36:04] should be a cold wallet so that's my
[36:07] Simple Solutions that's a bitbox you
[36:10] just put your Bitcoin on there back up
[36:12] your seed fres and you are better than
[36:15] 95% of all Bitcoin hodlers if you have
[36:18] more than ,000 in Bitcoin it's a
[36:21] absolutely must have one last thing
[36:23] before we get back to the video I'm
[36:25] really passionate about meeting other
[36:27] Bitcoin Runners and there's an amazing
[36:29] opportunity in middle of Europe in June
[36:32] the Bitcoin BR conference it's the best
[36:35] and biggest Bitcoin only conference in
[36:38] whole of Europe for all Americans please
[36:41] visit Europe and visit this place in
[36:43] June for all Europe's it's a must go
[36:46] anyways you're so close to the Bitcoin
[36:48] PR conference you basically have to come
[36:50] I will do interviews there and I would
[36:52] love to meet you all there use code
[36:55] Robin for all my sponsors to get
[36:58] discounts and use the links down in the
[37:00] description yeah and one of my favorite
[37:02] bitcoiners uh Jeff Bo is also from there
[37:04] like There's Hope right yes absolutely
[37:08] can't forget
[37:09] Jeff um which also brings me to an
[37:13] interesting topic um I was really
[37:15] interested in politics before Bitcoin
[37:17] like I was on on Austrian level like not
[37:21] high but I I was on the on Theory where
[37:25] I got quite high and I was really
[37:26] involved with with the elections like I
[37:29] was a coordinator between Austria uh it
[37:31] was so so much that I even like went at
[37:35] one point before election I had like 60h
[37:37] hour job in a party where I just
[37:39] coordinated a lot of stuff and I was
[37:41] really involved with politics and the
[37:43] funny thing is the more and more I got
[37:45] to realize what Bitcoin is and what
[37:47] money is I got more and more away from
[37:50] politics to that point right now that
[37:53] I'm like not involved at all like I'm
[37:56] sometimes watching some debate I'm
[37:57] sometimes seeing what's happening but
[38:00] I'm really not interested in it in it
[38:02] anymore because I feel like Bitcoin if
[38:05] Bitcoin succeeds it's kind of forces a
[38:08] free market onto the world which is an
[38:11] interesting F do you also think like
[38:12] when Bitcoin actually succeeds as the
[38:15] the sound money layer in our our
[38:17] financial system that governments have
[38:20] to be a little bit more capitalistic and
[38:22] a little bit more freedom loving in
[38:25] general or is that just a wishful
[38:27] thinking of my side well let's see if
[38:30] governments even exist anymore I mean
[38:32] may maybe maybe it's it's a anarco
[38:35] capitalist pipe dream to think that the
[38:37] entire world is is going to throw off
[38:40] the shackles of governments and and turn
[38:43] into entirely consensualist p uh private
[38:46] City organized Society something like
[38:48] that but uh I I think it's very likely
[38:51] that we're going to see some kind of uh
[38:53] private City model really take over when
[38:56] when bit coiners get together and and
[38:58] form these citadels in jurisdictions
[39:02] that are uh at least at least friendly
[39:05] towards that idea the the free private
[39:07] cities model that uh tius gaes uh
[39:13] um typis I think is his his organization
[39:17] but the free privac cities Foundation is
[39:18] is uh uh one of the things he's he's
[39:20] involved with uh it's it's it's a
[39:24] fascinating idea there there are so many
[39:25] of these private cities project s
[39:28] there's uh there's one in Honduras
[39:30] there's uh there's um some of these
[39:34] types of projects in in uh for example
[39:37] there's one in Norway in I believe it's
[39:41] is it North
[39:42] Macedonia there's a bunch of these
[39:44] private cities popping up and the idea
[39:46] is that someone owns the city and has
[39:49] the has the uh uh provides security for
[39:54] its its residents and all this and then
[39:56] the residents come in and sign a
[39:57] contract and that's it everything else
[40:00] is so there's there's a fee to live in
[40:02] the city but other than that everything
[40:04] else is is down to purely consensualist
[40:07] interaction and uh well it's an
[40:10] interesting idea and other other
[40:12] Concepts like free economic zones are
[40:15] interesting like Dubai has found massive
[40:18] amounts of of uh for example just
[40:21] business interest by creating a low
[40:23] taxation environment where business can
[40:25] come businesses can come in and and set
[40:27] up stop there and uh and so I mean this
[40:30] is this is atlas rug right this is this
[40:33] is uh John G going going away and
[40:36] leaving the society and and
[40:39] yeah these types of models I think are
[40:42] going to attract bitcoiners which is
[40:45] then going to attract all the all the
[40:47] capital of the the world and then these
[40:51] free private cities might be some of the
[40:54] most attractive places to go live and
[40:57] the governance model would be something
[40:59] that's entirely different from from the
[41:01] the type of of governance we see today
[41:04] but but maybe that's just a dream maybe
[41:07] that's maybe that's going to happen to
[41:09] some limited extent but we'll still have
[41:12] the the states the modern states that we
[41:15] we currently have for quite some time
[41:18] it's possible and I think in in that
[41:21] regard it's it's very likely that that
[41:24] governments will have less ability to
[41:26] control things this is this is sort of
[41:28] my optimistic take on something that's
[41:30] at least still uh at least grounded in
[41:33] the systems that we we currently have
[41:36] governments I think would would have
[41:38] much less capability to to to extract
[41:42] from its its populist right if you have
[41:45] money that is all based in Bitcoin right
[41:49] because let's set aside that uh anything
[41:52] of like that that Bitcoin would replace
[41:54] all the money there might be some layers
[41:56] on top of Bitcoin coin that are that are
[41:58] still resembling the the Fiat monetary
[42:01] system let's just sort of play with that
[42:03] for a second that governments might
[42:05] still have some kind of currency but
[42:06] that it's it's backed to some amount of
[42:08] of Bitcoin I could see that still
[42:10] happening uh so so maybe the maybe the
[42:13] idea is that to live in this country you
[42:15] have to pay some type of income tax and
[42:18] and this government currency still has
[42:20] to be deducted from your paycheck or
[42:22] something like that those things could
[42:24] still happen but if someone just has the
[42:27] ability to pay someone directly not go
[42:30] through government payroll systems
[42:31] various other things like that well then
[42:33] okay then then there's more optionality
[42:35] to opt out of these systems right and so
[42:40] I I think I think governments will have
[42:42] a lot less ability to control their
[42:44] populace in the future and it's it's
[42:46] interesting because the sort of leftwing
[42:49] leftwing right-wing divide that we
[42:52] currently have in in politics it's less
[42:54] it's less pronounced in Europe but of
[42:56] course in in America the uh Canada the
[42:59] UK it's it's pretty left right uh
[43:02] political parties that want to do less
[43:05] that want to be more freedom oriented
[43:07] while they're on the right side of the
[43:08] political Spectrum so to me it makes
[43:11] perfect sense that more people from the
[43:13] right side of politics would figure out
[43:16] Bitcoin before people on the left side
[43:19] now that if you come at it from the from
[43:21] the sort of so-called Progressive angle
[43:23] where Bitcoin can be used as a tool to
[43:25] help disadvantaged people people and to
[43:27] fix a a broken capitalist system okay I
[43:30] mean that's that's how we we get people
[43:32] on the so-called left that are figuring
[43:35] Bitcoin out but then I think what
[43:38] happens to a lot of people that come at
[43:39] it from the traditional left perspective
[43:42] they start to want the government to
[43:45] also do less and less and be less and
[43:46] less involved and just leave it up to
[43:48] fixing the the monetary system and so
[43:50] it's it's a complicated issue because to
[43:53] to me I think it's it's ASM totically
[43:56] approaching a state where there is no
[43:58] such thing as as a state no such thing
[44:01] as as a political system as we currently
[44:03] have it and democracy might have
[44:06] functioned for the last couple hundred
[44:08] years in most of the world but democracy
[44:13] has its own flaws as knot likes to say
[44:17] four guys can vote to beat up the fifth
[44:19] guy right and and so I think the the
[44:22] thing there is that uh if people have
[44:24] the ability to opt out of these
[44:26] so-called out out of these Democratic
[44:28] institutions they they won't function
[44:31] the same way anymore it needs the Buy in
[44:33] of the the whole population for the
[44:36] entire institution to even make sense
[44:38] and uh models that are approaching some
[44:41] kind of like real minimum governance
[44:45] model some some mainstream Libertarians
[44:48] advocate for still a state but all the
[44:50] state does is security
[44:53] basically those things I could see
[44:55] happening eventually but the the
[44:57] governance model maybe it's not
[44:58] something that looks like democracy
[45:00] anymore because that just might be
[45:03] outdated it might not be needed that
[45:06] that the the population votes for the
[45:08] things they want so we will have to see
[45:11] how it plays out and I think there will
[45:12] be a lot of variation throughout the
[45:14] world because it's it's not going to be
[45:17] that Bitcoin affects things at the same
[45:20] Pace throughout the whole world adoption
[45:22] is going to
[45:23] take take time take a different amount
[45:26] of time and different places
[45:27] and all this so we will have to see yeah
[45:30] and it's I had the offer of Bitcoin
[45:33] Nations also on Michael Anon Fisher and
[45:36] and he said something that I never heard
[45:38] before which is really interesting um
[45:40] once you have taxes you cannot have
[45:43] democracy like whenever there is taxes
[45:47] uh uh that are forced onto the populus
[45:50] uh democracy is just a Time way to uh
[45:55] not function anymore which is an
[45:57] interesting thought uh because of course
[45:59] like when you are forced to do something
[46:01] it's it's May maybe it's not that it's a
[46:04] real democracy or then we have to define
[46:06] democracy but yeah um is is like when
[46:09] when I listen to you uh is is the
[46:12] Bitcoin a vote at the elections
[46:14] especially because this year I feel like
[46:16] almost everybody listening now has an
[46:19] election like America has elections EU
[46:21] has elections Austria also has elections
[46:24] I mean uh and and there are a lot of
[46:26] other Congress that also have election
[46:28] is the Bitcoin a vote not to
[46:31] vote I don't think so now now this is
[46:34] this is a thing there's there's
[46:35] certainly two camps here Vote or not
[46:37] vote absolutely I don't think that's the
[46:40] thing to do the the current systems
[46:43] still exist and can have an effect on
[46:46] individual lives Absolutely I'll use
[46:48] Finland as an example here the just
[46:51] recently a fairly right-wing Coalition
[46:54] got in in Finland and a sort of ethn
[46:58] nationalist populist party was part of
[47:00] the the governing Coalition they were
[47:02] the second most popular party in the
[47:03] vote and I have nothing against parties
[47:05] like that forming a part of the
[47:07] government if they really are that
[47:09] popular right but the effect for me
[47:11] personally is that some of the
[47:12] immigration laws are going to to tighten
[47:15] up and and so it's a little bit more
[47:17] difficult for me personally to make
[47:20] things work and then to complicate
[47:22] matters a little bit is that I would
[47:24] have really had no good options to to
[47:26] vote for this election even if I had the
[47:28] right to vote in Finland uh because that
[47:30] they do have some sort of liberal
[47:32] parties that like and I think that's
[47:35] that's sort of small L liberal like uh
[47:38] Austrian economics liberal but but
[47:41] they're so unpopular they're not going
[47:43] to get any seats in the Parliament and
[47:45] they're going to have zero influence
[47:46] even if they do right and so and so
[47:48] theoretically there is no Bitcoin party
[47:51] in this election right but if any one of
[47:54] these parties were to come in and say
[47:56] out of the 11 or or something that get
[47:57] into Parliament and and say if any of
[48:00] these parties were to come in and say
[48:01] that they want to advocate for adopting
[48:03] Bitcoin well then okay vote for that but
[48:06] in cases where it's not obvious it's
[48:08] still worthwhile to to put your hand up
[48:11] and and vote for the the thing that is
[48:14] is going to make life the least
[48:18] unbearable in the short term I still
[48:20] think that's I still think that's valid
[48:22] now others are are of opposite opinions
[48:24] and and I can see the point where uh
[48:27] don't give validity to these systems
[48:29] right but then it's just letting life
[48:33] kind of go on without you and and sort
[48:37] of have to just abide by the decisions
[48:38] and and vote with your feet voting with
[48:40] your feet or voting with your wallet or
[48:42] the become the only options and maybe
[48:44] those should be the only options but
[48:46] there certainly can be cases where it
[48:49] makes sense to vote for political
[48:51] parties of of one persuasion and back to
[48:53] sort of one of the reasons I bring up
[48:54] kind of the the example from Finland
[48:56] like a right-wing Coalition
[48:58] theoretically should be more interested
[49:00] in the economy and the uh making making
[49:06] less taxes and spending less money but
[49:08] the these parties have not done that
[49:10] they they have raised taxes they'
[49:13] they're raising vat which I think is
[49:15] specifically the worst tax to to
[49:18] implement because it it's it it hits the
[49:21] lowest rung of the population the
[49:23] hardest and I don't mean that in the
[49:25] sense of a a
[49:27] some sort of social justice way I just
[49:29] mean that it's it's the thing that's
[49:30] going to make inflation hurt the worst
[49:33] so so so vat is is just absolutely a
[49:36] ridiculous tax I I think it
[49:40] yeah I want to get rid of all the taxes
[49:42] eventually but but that one can go uh
[49:45] pretty high on the on the list um but so
[49:49] this party has raised raised vat uh and
[49:53] they've they've raised um well they've
[49:56] done they've done a bunch of cutting but
[49:57] they're also raising various other taxes
[49:59] and all this and so it's just that you
[50:01] can't win right there is no side where
[50:04] it's like okay I'm going to vote more to
[50:06] the right because they're going to cut
[50:07] taxes and cut regulations and things
[50:09] they they say that but it it doesn't end
[50:12] up happening in Canada the choice is a
[50:14] little bit more clear that's that's the
[50:16] other example is that right now we have
[50:18] Justin Trudeau in in power over there
[50:21] and he's on the left side of the
[50:23] political Spectrum there and there is a
[50:25] a conservative on the right Challenger
[50:28] to him and I think in the short term
[50:31] it's going to be nothing but a good
[50:32] thing to get Justin Tru out of governing
[50:34] that country but over the last 20 years
[50:37] 30 years that that same conservative
[50:39] party has been in power and they have
[50:42] done things that have not been very
[50:44] Freedom oriented and so yeah it's it's
[50:47] sort of just picking your poison but I
[50:49] think if you don't vote you you don't
[50:51] really get to complain all you can do is
[50:53] vote with your feed or vote with your
[50:54] wallet and uh uh so I I think I think in
[50:57] cases where there would be a meaningful
[51:00] uh change in the short term yeah um
[51:03] voting is is one thing and influencing
[51:05] the political process is is another
[51:07] bitcoiners coming together and actually
[51:10] saying hey we exist and and we would
[51:12] like you to be friendly to bitcoin and
[51:15] here are the reasons why eventually that
[51:17] will get the attention of of politicians
[51:20] and the United States has I think been
[51:22] the best example of understanding this
[51:24] and and picking up the the the Bitcoin
[51:27] narrative at least on the the the
[51:29] Republicans over there have have started
[51:31] to do more uh towards Bitcoin but yeah
[51:34] it seems like it's really not happening
[51:36] so much in in Europe or uh other other
[51:40] parts of the world you you get isolated
[51:42] single politicians even Javier mle in
[51:45] Argentina he's he's no bitcoiner uh I I
[51:48] spoke with we spoke with uh
[51:51] um a guy who who knows him uh personally
[51:55] not not like closely but had been in
[51:57] contact with him and trying to orange
[51:58] pill him and and everything Ariel
[52:01] Aguilar uh from the Bitcoin uh project
[52:05] these these Bitcoin bands that you you
[52:06] might see sometimes in in Europe but uh
[52:09] yeah I mean melee might be this uh this
[52:14] serious libertarian guy and uh kind of
[52:16] cool uh against the system a little bit
[52:19] but he's definitely not uh definitely
[52:21] not a bitcoiner he's he's he's not pro
[52:23] Bitcoin so I think we've got a long way
[52:25] before for Bitcoin is going to be a a
[52:29] part of political parties positions uh
[52:33] throughout the world here and that would
[52:35] be the point where where the Bitcoin
[52:37] vote would be no-brainer uh I think
[52:41] single issue voter absolutely as long as
[52:43] that single issue is on the ballot yeah
[52:45] the thing that I like about jav Mal uh
[52:48] and I might be wrong but uh he wants a
[52:51] free competition between all currencies
[52:55] uh which is like the best step I've seen
[52:58] from a big nation like that uh when the
[53:01] leader says H we want at least a free
[53:03] competition between Bitcoin between the
[53:06] the fear currency between maybe even
[53:07] other cryptocurrencies which is fine for
[53:10] me because I feel like in every free
[53:11] market Bitcoin will win so like when we
[53:14] have free markets that's great like he
[53:17] doesn't have to be a bitcoiner he just
[53:18] has to let the free market make its
[53:20] things so that's like uh when he
[53:23] actually is like that when he actually
[53:25] wants to do that that's that's amazing
[53:27] and it's a pretty big step forward but
[53:30] definitely he's not a big coner like I
[53:32] seen some interviews and he's far away
[53:35] from an definitely yeah um but let's
[53:39] come back to an individual level as you
[53:42] are also like on the freedom footprint
[53:44] show as you have also the the co- off of
[53:47] the the groundw where you also said it's
[53:48] a little bit of about uh individual
[53:51] freedom and individual clown World
[53:54] inversing um How do you enhance your own
[53:57] Freedom
[53:59] footprint yeah that's a fantastic
[54:01] question thank you yeah so so me
[54:04] personally personally it my my way to do
[54:07] that has been to start to direct as much
[54:10] of my energy as possible towards Bitcoin
[54:14] and I was I was sort of down a different
[54:17] rabbit hole before I came into Bitcoin
[54:20] the my my way into Bitcoin was Via
[54:22] Jordan Peterson uh he really helped me
[54:26] straighten myself out back in my in my
[54:29] mid to late 20s uh I was a bit
[54:31] directionless and and didn't quite have
[54:34] uh this understanding of of how life
[54:36] worked properly uh and and so Jordan
[54:39] Peterson really helped me out with that
[54:40] especially his his maps of meaning
[54:42] lectures and also his maps of meaning
[54:44] book and and so I I ended up seeing uh
[54:49] Robert Breedlove on the Lex Freedman
[54:51] podcast and uh he talked about Jordan
[54:54] Peterson and his influence on on on him
[54:57] and and he was talking about Bitcoin
[54:59] there and that was the first thing that
[55:00] actually got me to think okay should I
[55:02] be looking into this more then I watched
[55:05] the Sailor series and well that's uh
[55:07] that was it I was I was hooked so I came
[55:10] at this from the angle of of individual
[55:13] personal responsibility that was really
[55:15] my my angle the the whole time and that
[55:18] that Bitcoin really could align with
[55:20] that the the most and be the be this
[55:22] tool for removing the noise of the world
[55:25] so that you could can find your own
[55:27] signal I I really resonated with ideas
[55:29] like that that's a Jeff boo ISM to to a
[55:31] certain extent finding the signal
[55:33] through the noise uh but but so the the
[55:35] angle that that I came at this was was
[55:37] always for that and so uh finding
[55:41] finding the meaning uh in in life and
[55:44] and finding the way to uh finding
[55:46] finding my my purpose and so increasing
[55:49] my personal freedom footprint has been
[55:52] to start working on bitcoin and what I
[55:55] was originally looking for was uh first
[55:59] first I got involved with can's
[56:00] publisher they they produced
[56:02] translations of of Bitcoin books uh to a
[56:06] whole bunch of languages including
[56:08] Finnish and the the thing about this is
[56:10] that uh I thought it was really strange
[56:13] that there was a company translating
[56:14] books into into Finnish it's an obscure
[56:16] language five million people and only
[56:18] used in one country and all this and so
[56:20] I I I was excited about that I I wanted
[56:23] to get involved and uh so I I I
[56:25] contacted them and and got involved
[56:28] doing that we're we're no longer uh with
[56:30] with them anymore but but yeah
[56:32] definitely still um still uh happy to
[56:35] have have gotten connected with with can
[56:38] through consensus Network there um but
[56:41] the the thing with that was the this
[56:43] podcast was just the perfect way for me
[56:45] to kind of get that going I'd had a
[56:47] podcast before I got into Bitcoin all
[56:49] about Norse mythology and Finnish
[56:52] mythology and it was it was actually an
[56:55] attempt to uh study stories through a
[57:00] sort of peterian lens he bro he breaks
[57:03] down uh stories from an archetypal
[57:06] perspective and gets into uh gets into a
[57:09] perspective of how story structure can
[57:12] can tell profound ideas in a a really
[57:16] simple way that also aligns with how we
[57:18] are wired biologically and
[57:19] psychologically so I attempted to do
[57:22] that he had done that with with some
[57:24] biblical stories especially the Book of
[57:25] Genesis
[57:26] and I attempted to do that through for
[57:28] Norse mythology essentially and it found
[57:31] its own little following and uh it was a
[57:33] lot of work to to do it's not it wasn't
[57:36] like a I did we did interviews but it it
[57:38] was it was a lot different from an
[57:40] interview show for sure but uh I I had
[57:43] done podcasting I had learned how to do
[57:44] it I had learned the the technical
[57:46] aspects and so when I came into Bitcoin
[57:48] I probably would have honestly done the
[57:49] same thing you're doing Robin just tried
[57:51] to Tred to start up a podcast and and
[57:53] see how that goes and and I I know
[57:56] that's a that's a the Hard Road just uh
[57:59] just bootstrapping that up so yeah good
[58:01] good on you for that and I think we
[58:02] absolutely need more Bitcoin podcasts
[58:05] even though if sometimes on bitcoin
[58:06] Twitter you get uh uh some people making
[58:09] snarky comments about everyone's got a
[58:11] Bitcoin podcast these days but it's such
[58:12] a great way to get people to explain
[58:15] their ideas in in a in a more open
[58:18] format and uh it's it's a great
[58:20] companion it it it it C podcasts
[58:23] certainly helped me uh breed loves what
[58:25] is money show and and um what Bitcoin
[58:28] did Daniel Prince is Once Bitten uh tons
[58:31] of podcasts tftc uh I don't know I can't
[58:34] shout them all out I definitely can't
[58:36] and this was back in back in like two
[58:38] two 2021 or so 2021 2022 when I was
[58:42] first um kind of going down the rabbit
[58:44] hole there uh but yeah I this was how I
[58:47] could contribute basically and so I I uh
[58:50] got involved um with with canot started
[58:53] the freedom footprint show the name is
[58:56] based on a a quote from from everything
[58:59] divided by 21 million and it's yeah just
[59:01] this idea that don't worry about your
[59:04] Caron footprint uh worry about your
[59:06] freedom footprint and yeah that's sort
[59:09] of sort of stuck and uh uh so the the
[59:12] main thing with the the Pod my my reason
[59:15] for doing it is to try to amplify voices
[59:17] that have this Freedom perspective and
[59:19] we talked to bitcoiners we talk to
[59:21] bitcoin adjacent people we won't talk to
[59:23]  coiners but we'll we'll basically
[59:26] talk to to anyone that's sort of in this
[59:28] Freedom orientation that isn't trying to
[59:30] scam people and uh yeah so the idea is
[59:33] just to amplify these voices and to to
[59:36] bounce ideas around because having
[59:38] someone as unique as canot in the
[59:39] picture uh he he he takes conversations
[59:43] in his own unique Direction I'll just
[59:44] say that and the idea there is that uh
[59:47] he's he's always got these ideas kicking
[59:50] around and uh bouncing them off the
[59:52] guests has basically turned into that uh
[59:55] we've got enough material for yeah a
[59:58] book and I'm I'm really proud of this
[60:00] book I'm proud of being involved in the
[60:03] the process uh the the way we we write
[60:06] together is like can has has written the
[60:09] the text but then we go over it all
[60:11] together make sure that the ideas all
[60:14] make sense and uh does this sentence
[60:17] make sense here do we need to add
[60:18] something there and so it's really been
[60:20] a collaborative process of of writing
[60:22] the thing but but can at the end of the
[60:23] day is the is the author extraordinary
[60:26] and I I absolutely would not want to
[60:28] take any more credit than than is do
[60:30] he's he's going to be the first one
[60:32] listed on the on the cover for good
[60:33] reason but I'm I'm proud and happy to be
[60:36] there with him and and helping to
[60:38] produce this book and so the the book
[60:40] and the Pod are the ways that I'm doing
[60:42] that I've also the the the other way as
[60:44] well is that I've I've got a series on
[60:48] um Rob breed loves what is money show on
[60:50] Jordan Peterson's maps of meaning I'm
[60:52] really proud of that as well really
[60:54] really proud of that I it's it's a niche
[60:57] topic but if you're at all interested in
[61:00] in Jordan Peterson's material and you
[61:02] want to kind of get it through a Bitcoin
[61:04] or angle Rob and I have both been really
[61:07] influenced by Jordan Peterson's work and
[61:10] it's a deep dive where I think it's
[61:12] going to be 11 episodes by the end of
[61:14] the the series we we just have to wrap
[61:16] it up there's at least two episodes yet
[61:18] to come out that are already recorded so
[61:21] um I'm I'm really proud of that so those
[61:23] are all ways that I'm trying to spread
[61:25] these
[61:26] messages and reach more people so that's
[61:29] the way I'm personally expanding my
[61:31] freedom footprint wow that was a that
[61:33] was a lot in there first of all like
[61:36] thank you for the for the remarks of the
[61:37] podcast yeah it's it's a hard thing to
[61:39] do but I actually have
[61:41] to um convince I'm actually convinced
[61:45] that everybody should have some form of
[61:49] um expressing themselves I mean like
[61:52] nobody like not everybody has to have a
[61:54] podcast I mean what is a podcast anyway
[61:56] it's for me it's usually it's actually
[61:57] just a YouTube show where I interview
[61:59] people like what what's what's
[62:01] considered a podcast at these days just
[62:03] that it's on Spotify also I don't know
[62:05] about if it's a podcast then but yeah
[62:08] you can you can make the argument that's
[62:09] a podcast um but I think everybody would
[62:13] benefit IM immensely just from
[62:15] expressing themselves if it's a blog or
[62:17] a book or a podcast or just like once a
[62:21] week they are putting some short form
[62:24] video on on on on on on YouTube and the
[62:27] great thing is you don't even have to
[62:28] dox yourself you can just be anonymous
[62:31] uh and make even like your you can even
[62:34] uh um transform your voice and do it in
[62:37] that way like you can just be completely
[62:39] anous and put the things out there and I
[62:42] think everyone um benefits from that
[62:45] immensely there's like I learn from
[62:47] every episode something uh and from the
[62:51] exchange with the community and also
[62:52] from like putting your thoughts into
[62:55] some form of content um benefits from
[62:58] you personally a lot so I love that you
[63:00] mentioned that uh that point and also
[63:03] like the maps of meaning I saw the
[63:05] playlist I wanted to see but then I was
[63:07] like oh it's a lot of episodes I will
[63:10] look into this once I have have more
[63:12] time but I I quickly looked over it I
[63:15] know Cho Peterson quite a lot uh but I
[63:18] did not know about maps of meaning too
[63:20] much I was how was this book called 12
[63:24] rules of life I think it's called the a
[63:26] book this was really good so I like his
[63:28] work a lot uh I feel like he's really
[63:30] good especially on video on Twitter he
[63:32] sometimes gets a little out of range but
[63:34] especially on video he is amazing uh
[63:37] thank you for sharing that uh and if
[63:40] before we come to the end uh end of the
[63:42] podcast maybe uh for people that want to
[63:45] see Jordan Peters and maps of meaning
[63:47] can you I mean you're making with Robert
[63:49] PR for like an an 10hour series about
[63:52] that so it's pretty hard to break it
[63:54] down in like a quick assignment but
[63:57] maybe let's try like can you like
[63:59] summarize what's maps of meaning and why
[64:01] should people like watch this because I
[64:03] feel like it's it's it's a really good
[64:04] one oh yeah awesome and uh no thanks and
[64:09] uh this this has been a big a big
[64:10] project for me and and yeah summarizing
[64:12] this I I'll do my best the the maps of
[64:15] meaning F first of all this is Jordan
[64:17] Peterson's first book The version I have
[64:20] is published in 1999 I think that's the
[64:23] I think that's the original publication
[64:24] date uh and so it's it's already it's
[64:26] already like 25 years old at at this
[64:29] point and 12 rules for life was sort of
[64:31] a distillation of of these messages
[64:34] after another 20 25 years of of talking
[64:37] maps of meaning is a book about
[64:39] psychology biology but especially about
[64:43] about archetypal narrative and
[64:45] archetypal narrative is the idea that
[64:48] the most important stories in the world
[64:50] boil down to a certain uh set of
[64:53] characters that represent real things in
[64:56] The Human Experience and real is in in
[65:01] this sense is a little bit that H the
[65:04] chair that I'm sitting on is real the
[65:05] microphone I'm talking into is real as
[65:07] in physically tangible but other things
[65:08] that are real are as abstract Concepts
[65:11] such as belief uh or or the the idea of
[65:16] the the known versus the unknown the the
[65:18] entire concept of the things that you
[65:20] know that's that's real and so the the
[65:23] idea is that people have been forming
[65:25] stories to communicate things about the
[65:27] world first of all before there was
[65:29] anything like writing but it was also a
[65:31] way of communicating deep ideas about
[65:34] how to act in the world and so the a
[65:38] really common archetypal story is sort
[65:40] of this Heroes Journey that's been
[65:41] popularized by Joseph Campbell this is
[65:44] only one type of story but a really
[65:45] basic hero story is something where
[65:48] there there's always a great father and
[65:50] a great mother the the the father
[65:52] represents the the realm of the known
[65:55] literally the matriarchy and the mother
[65:56] represents chaos and and this is that's
[65:59] a controversial thing and I don't want
[66:01] to to dig into the weeds you you'll have
[66:03] to uh take my word for it or well not
[66:06] take my word for it verify please uh uh
[66:09] check out the series but uh the idea is
[66:13] the the World falls into disrepair
[66:16] somehow and you you need a a hero who is
[66:20] usually the child of these these two
[66:21] figures to to come and and repair the
[66:24] world and the hero is the one who can uh
[66:27] who pays attention and who is able to
[66:30] take up the the mantle and and tame the
[66:33] forces of the the unknown world uh and
[66:36] so this could be slaying a dragon this
[66:38] could be uh slaying some some uh
[66:41] mythical monster something like that
[66:42] it's a it's a threat to the civilization
[66:44] and then and then this hero then
[66:47] eventually is able to to change the
[66:49] world for the better and and that's the
[66:51] the hero's story The really basic Hero's
[66:54] Story the one in maps of meaning cited
[66:56] is the story of Marduk the Mesopotamian
[66:58] original hero and there are other uh
[67:01] there are other stories that that it
[67:04] gets into there there's Egyptian
[67:05] mythology there's Norse mythology which
[67:07] I dig into a little bit more uh but the
[67:11] the book in general first of all starts
[67:12] by breaking down how we think
[67:15] psychologically about unknown things
[67:16] happening like what what if the elevator
[67:19] out of your building is out of service
[67:21] what if there the the stairwells are are
[67:23] blocked something like that is that
[67:24] going to make you late for for your
[67:25] meeting or is that going to make you
[67:27] potentially uh die in a in a fire in
[67:29] your building something like that we
[67:31] have we have different responses to to
[67:32] different things there and then he has a
[67:34] short but very very good chapter about
[67:37] how this all actually is backed up by by
[67:39] neurobiology that was impressive to me
[67:41] because he's he's not complet he's not
[67:43] pulling this out of his ass this is
[67:45] rooted in in in actual biology the way
[67:48] the way people navigate the world and
[67:50] then it's a long massive exploration of
[67:53] different types of stories and what
[67:55] mean and the the thesis of the book just
[67:58] to get to the end here is that the the
[68:01] book says that the the best way of
[68:04] finding meaning is to find the highest
[68:07] good you can conceive of take that up as
[68:09] the mantle and become the hero and
[68:12] become the savior of the the world do do
[68:15] make the best effort to do that and it's
[68:18] it's hard uh the figure of of Jesus
[68:20] Christ is is the culmination of of this
[68:24] story in Western civilization and that
[68:26] might be a little uncomfortable for
[68:28] people who have some religious um
[68:30] baggage I I have some I I was raised
[68:34] Christian and I don't consider myself a
[68:36] Christian anymore but through reading
[68:37] this book I have much greater
[68:39] appreciation for for Christian thought
[68:41] Christian theology what I reject is
[68:43] Dogma I reject the the dogma of the
[68:47] large religious institutions but the
[68:49] message of of Christianity at least in
[68:52] the archetypal form is very very good so
[68:55] so the series that I've done with Rob is
[68:58] going to be explaining these things from
[69:00] a lay person's perspective neither of us
[69:03] has done anything but just read this
[69:05] book deeply uh and and had all the
[69:08] Bitcoin stuff and other life experiences
[69:10] to to tie into it it's got a lot in
[69:12] common with Austrian economics without
[69:15] having any knowledge of it uh and
[69:17] there's a cool section at the end that
[69:19] implies that Bitcoin is the final form
[69:23] of the centuries if not thousands year
[69:26] thousands of years long pursuit of
[69:28] alchemy so uh hopefully that's a little
[69:32] teaser but our series is is one way of
[69:35] of learning more about this I also
[69:37] recommend Jordan Peterson's own lecture
[69:39] series the maps of meaning lecture
[69:40] series that he recorded at the
[69:42] University of Toronto while he was still
[69:44] there those are still up on YouTube
[69:45] they're fantastic uh and so you you can
[69:47] take that route or if you're uh wanting
[69:50] a more Bitcoin oriented take then mine
[69:54] and Rob series is is uh the way to go so
[69:57] that's on the what is Money
[69:59] Channel love it love it um before we
[70:02] come to the end te uh one quick question
[70:04] what are you currently extremely
[70:06] passionate about uh besides Bitcoin
[70:09] besides your book besides me all the
[70:12] things that we already talked about is
[70:13] there anything else that you are deeply
[70:15] researching and
[70:16] doing the only thing that is a constant
[70:20] companion with me in my life is music I
[70:22] I love music it's it's being one of
[70:25] those things that has has brought me
[70:27] lots of joy and and kept me going
[70:30] through hard times I love discovering
[70:31] new music uh I I uh I'm playing in a in
[70:35] a band with with can and Nirvana cover
[70:38] band also with Sam Samo and mark from
[70:41] The Princess Hotel in pling again and so
[70:43] stay tuned uh we might be doing some
[70:45] gigs at uh conferences if uh we're all
[70:48] there at the same time but uh the
[70:50] playing of music is less important for
[70:52] me these days I used to be really into
[70:53] playing playing music but the these days
[70:56] it's it's more just a a tool to make the
[70:59] the world more uh more bearable for me I
[71:03] I I wish I had uh something else to to
[71:06] add than that but man life is packed at
[71:10] the moment uh writing a book while
[71:11] running a pod while having a full-time
[71:13] job and I've got a new kid and and all
[71:15] this it's it's uh life is packed the
[71:18] days go by fast and I I feel like I
[71:20] don't have enough time in the day for
[71:22] everything I need to do but somehow
[71:24] somehow
[71:26] uh the the things are getting done and
[71:28] uh we're we're we're hurdling towards
[71:30] the release date of the inversive clown
[71:32] World it will be out on August 21st
[71:34] that's Bitcoin Infinity day so still a
[71:36] little ways to to go hopefully yeah well
[71:39] I I assume this episode will be out
[71:41] before then but but uh yeah Bitcoin
[71:43] Infinity day so yeah after that maybe
[71:45] I'll have a little bit more time in my
[71:47] brain to to think about other things but
[71:50] I uh at the moment I I tend to fill my
[71:53] life with with Bitcoin uh for the the
[71:55] most part and my family and uh staying
[71:58] in shape and uh listening to music that
[72:01] I like and uh yeah that's me uh I I
[72:05] appreciate the the hustle for Bitcoin
[72:07] and yes the the podcast episode will out
[72:09] be out probably before June even uh so
[72:13] it it will be definitely uh out before
[72:15] the book um we have inro in the podcast
[72:18] where the previous guest asked a
[72:20] question for the next guest without
[72:21] knowing who the next guest actually is
[72:23] um and your question from the guest is
[72:26] if you invest € 10 every week in Bitcoin
[72:29] from 2014 to
[72:31] 2024 how much do you think cut feeling
[72:35] would it be now uh in total 10 EUR every
[72:38] week for 10 years uh it's an investment
[72:40] of over two 5,000 Euros uh but then
[72:44] there's the of course the price
[72:47] appreciation of Bitcoin since 2014 in
[72:49] there uh do you have any cut
[72:52] feelings uh I'm thinking it's in the
[72:54] millions at the moment uh starting in
[72:57] 2014 definitely I don't have an exact
[72:59] line on the on the price but what would
[73:01] the amount of Bitcoin be I I feel like
[73:03] that's got to be at least 20 30 Bitcoin
[73:05] uh I I'll I'll go two million euros
[73:08] something like that I love it because
[73:10] you were as wrong as I I was also it's
[73:15] it's just
[73:16] 300,000 actually it's it's it's it's
[73:19] like okay that's five or six Bitcoin
[73:21] right yeah yeah is around that uh and
[73:23] then I was like uh I I was also
[73:26] massively overshooting it because in
[73:27] 2014 the price was already already
[73:30] around the Thousand EUR like it was in
[73:32] the highest like 800 900 uh so 10 EUR is
[73:36] like but it it went down the year I
[73:38] think it was down like to 300 EUR in
[73:41] 2014 uh but it's an interesting uh thing
[73:44] to do but I also massively over shoten
[73:47] and the the like really I was like I
[73:50] think I said 8 million which was complet
[73:53] it was completely wrong
[73:55] but yeah um you have done the honor
[73:58] after the after the recording to put up
[74:01] a question for the next guest and and
[74:02] and and mess him with him if you want
[74:06] okay you're not gonna put me on the on
[74:07] the spot I'll give it to
[74:09] you some guests actually do that on them
[74:13] on their own because they're like oh I I
[74:15] have already can actually did
[74:18] it he said after his answer directed the
[74:22] question for the next guest and without
[74:23] me having the chance
[74:26] but I try to give the guests like like
[74:30] two seconds to think about without the
[74:32] recording running and because it's
