[00:00] once you start Mining and running nodes
[00:01] then you see the three-part triangle of
[00:04] the ecosystem and how you can partake
[00:06] and be incentivized to do each one you
[00:08] want to immerse yourself in this
[00:09] ecosystem because everything else is a
[00:12] shitcoin I run s9s in my garage to heat
[00:14] it it just heats the garage Bitcoin
[00:16] mining has gone industrialized I really
[00:19] think you're going to start to see over
[00:20] the next couple years it start to come
[00:22] back into like a residential sense more
[00:24] like a personal use imagine every house
[00:27] having their own miners you will come
[00:29] back and we do a podcast 10 years from
[00:31] now and you will see not only home
[00:33] mining but I think your refrigerators
[00:36] your dishwashers your dryers your
[00:38] washers will all have bit ax little
[00:40] miners in them so that when you're
[00:42] drying your clothes you're not just
[00:44] wasting energy it helps you get out of
[00:46] the Rat Race it helps you get off that
[00:48] wheel Bitcoin is honest hard money then
[00:52] you start looking at well what's fat and
[00:54] then you go down the rabbit hole of uh
[00:56] corruption and inflation and the banking
[00:59] sector and you start seeing things and
[01:00] you're like this is evil There's real
[01:02] evil in the world and there's people
[01:04] that will take from you and have no
[01:06] remorse about
[01:07] [Music]
[01:10] it you said in the beginning uh Bitcoin
[01:12] are are industrialized like what did you
[01:16] say industrious so we we find a way
[01:20] right like we're very like uh we can
[01:22] look at two sticks and we can create
[01:25] whatever we want with it I I don't know
[01:27] like I see that in the community but I'm
[01:30] a millright also so like for me that's
[01:32] just in my nature is to like find a way
[01:36] there's there's always an answer just
[01:38] need to find it I love that a lot really
[01:40] cool uh I want to to start off with the
[01:43] question today with um what's your
[01:46] biggest learning since you have been on
[01:49] my first podcast I think it has been
[01:52] January where we uh published it in like
[01:55] December or something like that where we
[01:57] recorded it so like it's around like 10
[01:59] months ago
[02:00] um what has been your your biggest
[02:03] learnings within Bitcoin or your biggest
[02:06] like highlight within Bitcoin in the
[02:08] past like 10 months uh well you know it
[02:11] would I guess it would be the people
[02:13] that I've uh been able to uh explain
[02:16] Bitcoin to and that they've gotten it
[02:18] there's been a few family members that I
[02:20] didn't think were going to get it uh
[02:22] there's been people it seems to me
[02:25] almost like I tweeted a couple days ago
[02:27] for me I I try and immerse my myself in
[02:31] every aspect of Bitcoin you have your
[02:33] mining you have your nodes but you also
[02:36] have your tokens right you can hold
[02:38] Bitcoin you can run a node and you can
[02:41] run a miner or you can do none of these
[02:44] or any part of it it's a to me it's a
[02:47] three-part ecosystem so I've really
[02:49] tried to learn more about Mining and uh
[02:52] node running this year uh instead of
[02:56] instead of orange pilling people uh I
[02:59] find it it's more convincing to explain
[03:02] to them why they need to run a node and
[03:05] to get them to build a node and then
[03:07] they can really see like the the nuts
[03:10] and bolts of Bitcoin once you run a node
[03:12] and you can punch commands into the
[03:14] prompt and you can audit the system
[03:16] you're like holy smokes what's going on
[03:19] here you know holding tokens is nice uh
[03:22] number go up you know you're your money
[03:24] will appreciate but once you start uh
[03:26] Mining and running nodes then you see
[03:28] the three part
[03:30] uh triangle of the ecosystem and how you
[03:32] can partake and be incentivized to do
[03:34] each one right like I don't get paid to
[03:36] run a node I I do it out of the um my
[03:40] own interest right I have a copy of the
[03:44] blockchain stored in my home I broadcast
[03:48] my own transactions I had someone DM me
[03:51] yesterday and they and it's um a younger
[03:54] person he's about 17 he's dating my
[03:56] niece and he wants to know the ins and
[03:59] outs of Bitcoin not just where can I buy
[04:01] it he's like I'm trying to explain to
[04:04] people how the blockchain works and I
[04:06] keep getting caught up people ask me a
[04:08] question and I don't have an answer can
[04:10] you he's like can you please lead me in
[04:12] a direction and I sent him a few
[04:14] articles on proof of work um the
[04:17] Byzantine General problem that Satoshi
[04:20] solved for and but it's I said this is
[04:23] very technical stuff it takes a long
[04:25] time to get this like I don't know about
[04:28] you Robin but I've been studying bit
[04:29] coin since 2017 and I honestly feel like
[04:33] I I barely even understand it like I
[04:35] know where I can buy it I know how to
[04:37] set up and run a node uh I can plug in
[04:40] my minor and point it at a pool but
[04:42] those are really just surface layers of
[04:44] Bitcoin each of those things you can go
[04:46] down rabbit holes for a very long time
[04:48] like even nodes you can go down the
[04:51] deepest rabbit hole we have
[04:53] um oh the datm is coming out for the
[04:58] lightning Network I don't know if you
[05:00] dabble in lightning at all but they're
[05:02] building um Layer Two stuff on Lightning
[05:05] too and there's a new um implementation
[05:07] coming out called bolt 12 for the
[05:10] lightning Network where you can now
[05:12] Force Bitcoin on people you could load a
[05:15] QR code with Bitcoin it's essentially
[05:18] like an invoice so if someone owed you
[05:21] money or you wanted to give money to
[05:23] someone you could use this new lightning
[05:25] implementation to gift Bitcoin and and
[05:28] we're going to start using it to try and
[05:31] uh integrate it into bit day cards.com
[05:34] and see if we can use uh QR codes to
[05:37] gift Bitcoin to friends and family in
[05:39] the future so um learning about
[05:42] lightning is something I've been uh
[05:44] focusing on it's it's another Rabbit
[05:47] Hole like I said bolt 12 datm is coming
[05:50] out uh which I listened to Preston's
[05:54] podcast he released it Preston pish last
[05:56] week he had mechanic on there uh I wish
[06:00] I had his name but this guy is like he's
[06:02] a wizard and I've been following him on
[06:04] Twitter he's the one that's releasing
[06:06] datm for the ocean mining pool and for
[06:09] the first time miners will be able to
[06:12] build their own template so literally
[06:14] with my Miner in my garage and my node
[06:18] I'll be able to build my own template
[06:21] and when I solve a block if I do I can
[06:23] sign that template with whatever I want
[06:26] like Tommy Boy was here and it'll be
[06:28] etched in in history forever so really I
[06:32] there isn't one main area that I've
[06:34] focused on learning about it's it's all
[06:36] of them because it's so broad
[06:39] Bitcoin it's hard to really just focus
[06:42] on one because when you're studying one
[06:44] thing a phrase or terminology comes up
[06:46] and you're like well what's this you
[06:48] know what's the Byzantine General's
[06:49] problem boom there you go two weeks
[06:52] you're going down that rabbit hole right
[06:54] and then you're learning about you know
[06:56] well who is Satoshi and then you're
[06:58] going down that rabbit hole and what do
[07:01] you mean there's only 21 million
[07:02] Bitcoins ever going to exist then you go
[07:04] down that rabbit hole there's so many
[07:06] holes in Bitcoin you just need to really
[07:08] be careful where you're stepping it's
[07:11] it's it's super interesting because uh I
[07:13] thought I have a good crasp on bitcoin
[07:16] when I started the podcast and now
[07:18] looking back 10 months I understand that
[07:21] I didn't understand anything no like I
[07:24] had no clue about anything and still now
[07:28] there are so many things that I have no
[07:30] clue but for example I never heard datm
[07:32] I have no clue what what datam is or
[07:35] what you were talking about what this
[07:37] means for for the lightning redw maybe
[07:39] uh for for the people also like me that
[07:41] never heard about it what like in in in
[07:44] in layman's terms or like in in general
[07:46] terms what is that what try does it try
[07:49] to to achieve okay so I'm myself like
[07:53] I've just kind of started to go down
[07:54] this Rabbit Hole
[07:56] um and so I'll try my best to explain I
[08:00] learned about datm through like I said
[08:02] Preston P's podcast but I went and I
[08:04] researched a little bit and so datam
[08:07] comes out of the ocean mining pool and
[08:09] if you know anything about ocean um
[08:12] that's Luke dasher's uh pool for mining
[08:16] right so if you're a miner you need to
[08:18] point your hash rate at a pool well the
[08:21] more you learn about uh pools the more
[08:24] you see that it is actually really
[08:25] centralized there's only about six or
[08:27] seven players that make your transaction
[08:30] templates so when you see the block
[08:33] getting verified and you see all the
[08:34] transactions in it somebody had to make
[08:37] that template somebody had to say okay
[08:39] I'm going to take this transaction that
[08:40] has the highest fees and I'm going to
[08:42] put it in this template because it's
[08:44] financially incentivizes me to put this
[08:46] in the block well what Ocean's doing
[08:50] they're trying to like
[08:52] decentralize um mining pools so that we
[08:55] can take back some power right and so
[08:58] this what I'm learning that if I point
[09:00] my hash rate at Ocean I'm going to start
[09:02] doing that but they also want to take it
[09:04] another step further because if you just
[09:07] point your minor at Ocean they will
[09:09] build the template for you and building
[09:11] the template is very important because
[09:14] if you centralize the template you give
[09:17] governments an attack Vector to attack
[09:21] Bitcoin like if they only have to go to
[09:22] Six companies and say hey block these
[09:25] transactions block this list of wallets
[09:27] um make sure that all your templates are
[09:29] OA compliant then it's really easy for
[09:32] government to just attack six companies
[09:34] but if we all are Solo mining which
[09:39] oceans trying to move towards but in a
[09:42] in a in a non-s Solo way it's hard to
[09:45] explain the technical nuts and bolts of
[09:47] it but so that's what Ocean's trying to
[09:50] offer but on top of ocean they're um
[09:52] integrating a protocol that you can run
[09:55] uh on the side and and mechanic says
[09:57] it's very light it's like 300 Kil but
[09:59] it's just a protocol that runs alongside
[10:02] your ocean mining account and it will
[10:04] allow you to build a template so you can
[10:08] I can build my own template which really
[10:11] is I think one of the issues that we
[10:13] need to look at as bitcoiners right now
[10:15] is the centralization of mining pools I
[10:18] right now unfortunately like I'm pointed
[10:20] at ant pool right now just because of
[10:22] convenience right sometimes we become
[10:25] lazy as bitcoiners or we just find the
[10:28] path of least resistance which I find
[10:30] that maybe I've done this last year so
[10:33] you know I've given myself a kick in the
[10:34] butt and I'm going to I'm waiting for
[10:36] datm to come out it hasn't been released
[10:38] yet I DMD mechanic and he said uh it's
[10:41] pretty much on the cusp of being
[10:43] released so even if you have like a
[10:45] little S9 minor heating your garage I
[10:47] really urge people to take a look at
[10:49] Ocean pool and and then to run also the
[10:52] datm protocol but you have to run a node
[10:55] too so your node communicates with your
[10:57] minor and then if you solve block it
[11:00] uses your
[11:02] template I hope that kind of gives you
[11:04] like a little bit of information enough
[11:06] to get you started down that rabbit hole
[11:08] I think it actually does and I think
[11:10] it's a really important topic also
[11:13] because I think that's a topic that
[11:16] comes up more and more where people are
[11:18] concerned about that mining pool
[11:21] centralization mining itself is quite
[11:24] decentralized like I think America is
[11:26] probably the the biggest one with like I
[11:27] don't know 20 30% what I heard last time
[11:30] uh which is I think kind of great that
[11:33] we are decentralized in the in where the
[11:36] miners are located but then there is the
[11:38] the the mining pools and there are
[11:40] basically a few three four five that are
[11:43] really big and they they control uh the
[11:46] the mining pools and they're not that
[11:48] many is that even if we would assume
[11:51] that uh ocean is not working or like we
[11:54] cannot decentralize the mining pools
[11:56] from a like situation where we we have
[11:59] those big mining pools going forward
[12:01] would you would you think that's a major
[12:04] issue for Bitcoin or is it just a small
[12:07] inconvenience uh for me I'm I'm not
[12:11] really a criminal and I I'm not on any
[12:13] black list so for me personally it
[12:17] doesn't really affect me but it is a
[12:19] like I said it's an attack Vector that
[12:21] the governments or The Regulators can
[12:23] start working on right so as it doesn't
[12:28] affect me personally it's something we
[12:29] do need to uh start focusing on and I'm
[12:32] really grateful for the people over at
[12:34] Ocean and that they've started this task
[12:36] is if they didn't bring it to the
[12:37] Forefront we wouldn't like personally I
[12:39] don't even know if I would know about it
[12:41] right and and the more I uh learn about
[12:44] Bitcoin the more I actually want to run
[12:47] miners I want to run nodes I want two or
[12:49] three nodes you want to immerse yourself
[12:52] in this ecosystem
[12:54] because everything else is a shitcoin
[12:56] absolutely
[12:58] yeah is really interest would you I for
[13:02] example didn't run my own uh Min till
[13:07] now like mining is something I still am
[13:10] not in um is that something that
[13:13] everyone should look into in in like
[13:15] running a solo Min or like buying one
[13:17] rig of an S9 or something like that and
[13:20] and trying to to get the tech working
[13:22] especially if we can also get like uh
[13:24] something going like the the the ocean
[13:27] mining datum uh that that's really cool
[13:30] um or is it only something for if you
[13:33] really want to be be nerdy and and
[13:35] something about that this is great I
[13:38] love this topic personally mining is my
[13:40] favorite topic I think it has the
[13:42] brightest future um
[13:45] although um it's become really
[13:48] industrialized uh as of late like really
[13:51] it's big factories with these you know
[13:54] rows and rows of uh miners that run on
[13:57] 240 volts like you know here in Canada
[14:01] uh only our our stoves and our dryers
[14:03] run on 240 volts or if you have a hot
[14:06] tub so it's challenging for homeowners
[14:10] to mine unless you find yourself like an
[14:13] old S9 Miner and whatnot which which I
[14:16] do I run s9s in my garage to heat it
[14:19] right it just heats the garage because
[14:22] uh the only byproduct of mining is heat
[14:25] so to me once people start waking up to
[14:29] this and seeing how uh you can use this
[14:31] heat in so many different ways there's
[14:34] uh a few people on Twitter I follow Mike
[14:37] Michael Schmidt is one he was also on
[14:39] Preston's podcast and I can share his um
[14:42] Twitter with you and this guy has a
[14:46] blueprint he can has a step-by-step
[14:48] guide for people to build um in their
[14:53] furnace rooms they can submerse a minor
[14:57] and Heat their entire house they can can
[14:59] heat their hot water tank their hot tubs
[15:01] their pools in your home so for me I
[15:04] people think like okay well Bitcoin
[15:06] mining has gone industrialized I really
[15:08] think you're going to start to see over
[15:09] the next couple years it start to come
[15:12] back into like a residential sense more
[15:14] like a personal use you see right now
[15:17] that on Twitter everybody has these bid
[15:19] ax little miners right the this I think
[15:23] is the beginning of the Resurgence of
[15:26] Home mining I think in the future the
[15:29] next decade you'll see people like you
[15:30] and me bitcoiners we're going to start
[15:33] like plugging these little miners in and
[15:35] and uh and start seeing what we can do
[15:37] with them right like like I said my
[15:39] garage is heated all winter by Bitcoin
[15:42] I've posted uh over the last week other
[15:44] things that I dry in front of the miners
[15:47] it's it's an amazing thing and it's just
[15:49] I really think it's just at the
[15:50] beginning it went industrialized mining
[15:53] but I think you'll start seeing the
[15:55] pullback towards more um home mining and
[15:59] the use of the heat like even uh in
[16:03] Quebec here I can buy an s19 J for
[16:07] $990 right and I can plug that in it's
[16:11] 240 volt 30 amp it's a it's a big plug
[16:15] but I can unplug my hot tub I can have
[16:17] an electrician come here and just switch
[16:18] out and easily be able to plug in um a
[16:22] 20040 volt minor so I think you'll start
[16:26] to see a lot more of that type of stuff
[16:28] even um downtown in your metropolises I
[16:32] don't know why skyscrapers haven't
[16:33] started to look at this as uh we could
[16:36] all put mining facilities in the
[16:37] basement and use that heat to heat the
[16:40] water and the air for all of our
[16:42] residents or if it's a business
[16:44] skyscraper uh for all the businesses in
[16:47] this in the uh building you're really
[16:49] going to start to see humans realize
[16:50] holy smokes there's more usage use case
[16:54] for mining than just um creating Bitcoin
[17:00] it's super interesting also the uh
[17:02] capitalizing on The Heat Of The Miner uh
[17:05] which then you could even go ahead and
[17:08] build a hot tub where the hot tub is
[17:11] heated by the minor so you just like
[17:13] plug in the hot tub you don't even have
[17:15] to get switch around that you can build
[17:18] a hot tub with uh mining with the with
[17:21] the with the the Bitcoin Heating and
[17:24] there are really cool home projects from
[17:27] people out there they just like go out
[17:29] there and make those those projects in
[17:31] reality um really interesting will it be
[17:35] when commercial products are coming out
[17:37] like an an ready implemented hot tub
[17:41] that has a Bitcoin minor in them I mean
[17:44] we kind of see that already with like
[17:46] how's the company called I think 21
[17:48] energy it's an aan company who builds uh
[17:51] mining heaters you can just plug it in
[17:54] and it's super easy and the Min is
[17:56] plugged into the the in the heater
[17:58] because think we probably don't get to a
[18:01] mass adoption of solo and DEC
[18:04] decentralized mining if there's not um a
[18:08] commercial product around it which makes
[18:10] it really easy uh to Plug and Play that
[18:13] that that whole thing um probably
[18:16] probably most people will never um
[18:19] figure mining out for themselves but
[18:22] maybe I'm wrong maybe maybe maybe I'm
[18:24] wrong probably commercial products has
[18:26] to come out to make that transition
[18:28] really nice which which will be amazing
[18:32] imagine every house having their own
[18:34] miners uh from I don't know solar energy
[18:37] or whatever uh that that's that's a I
[18:40] think the mining industry is still quite
[18:43] underrated in in in the Bitcoin
[18:47] ecosystem as at least as I think about
[18:50] it yeah like you hit the nail right on
[18:53] the head Robin I think personally you
[18:56] can mark it down here we'll make a
[18:57] prediction me and you will will come
[18:59] back and we'll do a podcast 10 years
[19:00] from now and you will see not only home
[19:04] mining but I think your refrigerators
[19:07] your dishwashers your dryers your
[19:09] washers will all have like bit ax little
[19:12] miners in them so that when you're
[19:14] drying your clothes you're not just
[19:16] wasting energy it's very inefficient I I
[19:19] believe people will find a way to
[19:21] implement miners into almost everything
[19:23] that we do that runs daily to me one
[19:27] thing I I see on a daily basis is the
[19:30] wasted energy in vehicles in cars right
[19:34] like these cars are all generating
[19:36] electricity with alternators I I don't
[19:38] know why a company hasn't come along I'm
[19:40] sure there's reasons but installed
[19:42] miners in vehicles so while you're
[19:45] driving around you're also mining
[19:47] Bitcoin and and maybe it's a small
[19:49] fraction like with how much energy you
[19:51] can produce but it it sure beats nothing
[19:54] right like my minor C the S9 in my
[19:56] garage it costs me a little bit of money
[19:58] to heat or to run but uh and especially
[20:02] with the having event in April it went
[20:04] from a dollar to 50 cents a day for per
[20:07] S9 but it's it's 50 cents that I if I
[20:10] had a regular heater I wouldn't get so
[20:14] you're really going to see people like
[20:16] me and you start figuring it out that
[20:19] there was a lot of energy out there that
[20:20] we need to start capturing and sending
[20:22] it through as6 absolutely really cool
[20:24] how was the Haring event for you in in
[20:27] April as you also run honor yourself uh
[20:30] like I said My Rewards got cut in half
[20:32] uh immediately uh I was
[20:35] actually where was I was at a Luke
[20:37] Colmes concert in Buffalo New York with
[20:39] my wife and two family friends and the
[20:42] having event happened right during the
[20:45] concert and I looked around and nobody
[20:48] cared I looked at my wife I'm like look
[20:51] look 840,000 woohoo and we clapped a
[20:54] little bit and I looked around and not a
[20:56] single person cared Robin that just lets
[20:59] me know that's how early we really are
[21:02] like some people are like oh I got to
[21:03] get as much as I can today like that um
[21:06] my niece's boyfriend he's been talking
[21:09] to me uh via DM over Twitter uh he's
[21:12] been asking so many questions about
[21:13] Bitcoin and he's just like I want to
[21:15] know everything now I got to get so much
[21:17] Bitcoin and I'm like I'm like Jackson
[21:20] just relax you have your whole life okay
[21:23] just do what you can on a daily basis
[21:25] don't get
[21:26] overwhelmed uh with it because one thing
[21:29] you learn when you understand Bitcoin
[21:32] you understand low time preference
[21:35] everything on bitcoin slows down you
[21:37] don't need to rush life's not inflating
[21:40] away on you okay so you can take your
[21:42] time just do one or two podcasts a week
[21:45] you know pick up a book and read for an
[21:46] hour I assure you Jackson you will be
[21:49] where you need to be okay one thing that
[21:52] Bitcoin has uh brought into my life is
[21:54] um a higher power uh I he brought Jesus
[21:57] and God into life and and that even
[22:00] slowed things down more right I
[22:03] understand that everything happens
[22:04] exactly how it's supposed to so this is
[22:07] a beautiful thing a feature of Bitcoin
[22:09] is why I urge people to understand it is
[22:12] it helps you get out of the Rat Race it
[22:14] helps you get off that wheel absolutely
[22:16] really really cool um which I'm really
[22:19] curious like I think a lot about what
[22:22] Bitcoin will do the society and and to
[22:24] the world uh once more people get it and
[22:27] once it's like right now we we are a
[22:30] very small community if you see the
[22:32] whole thing like how many people
[22:34] actually understand Bitcoin I don't
[22:36] count the people that have like um yeah
[22:38] they have like an in coinbase account
[22:40] and they have like 5% of their portfolio
[22:42] in Bitcoin uh those people excluded like
[22:46] how many people actually understand what
[22:48] what Bitcoin means and what Bitcoin
[22:50] represents the number has to be so so
[22:54] low it's it's fascinating probably in
[22:56] the greater things of fi but what
[22:58] happens once we get this number up to
[23:01] like 10 million people 100 million
[23:04] people or maybe even like uh a billion
[23:07] people that actually understand Bitcoin
[23:10] and then I'm like okay let's let's look
[23:12] at the people right now that adopted a
[23:15] Bitcoin standard what the change in in
[23:17] in their behavior and maybe we can then
[23:20] understand what what Bitcoin might do to
[23:22] to the world so the question for you
[23:24] like what what did Bitcoin change uh in
[23:27] you you said higher power it gave you
[23:30] that low time preference uh what do you
[23:32] mean by that uh well I'm not sure if if
[23:36] the higher power came into my life first
[23:39] I I assure you it did I I have to be
[23:41] very careful um it it brought God into
[23:45] my life and and and the Bible and Jesus
[23:48] and that's really like I've focused just
[23:50] as much on that this year as
[23:52] understanding the life of Jesus as I
[23:54] have um the life of Satoshi Nakamoto and
[23:58] and and Bitcoin I've almost uh found
[24:01] that Jesus is taking over my life more
[24:04] than Bitcoin right it's it's a real gift
[24:08] the Bible and I urge people like I
[24:11] orange pill people um and then once I
[24:14] orange pill them I really tell them they
[24:16] need to look at at the life of Jesus too
[24:18] and understand what that what he did and
[24:21] and his story uh and I'm not talking
[24:23] about organized religion I'm talking
[24:26] about uh spirituality you know
[24:29] uh the fundamental the soul that you
[24:31] have inside you I'm not talking about
[24:33] going to church and donating which is is
[24:35] a nice thing too but um I don't want to
[24:39] speak ill of churches but I find they're
[24:42] um managed by humans and humans are
[24:44] corrupt and and you get egos involved in
[24:46] churches but if you can just pick up the
[24:49] Bible and learn about Jesus uh it's
[24:52] going to add uh so many more layers and
[24:55] and um to your life it's it's an amazing
[24:58] thing I really urge people to to do that
[25:00] after you learn about Bitcoin
[25:03] right it's is interesting how how it
[25:06] goes but but that higher power did
[25:10] Bitcoin change something in in in in
[25:12] your behavior with the low time
[25:13] preference and and realizing that uh
[25:16] Bitcoin actually like over time gives
[25:19] you more purchasing power than like less
[25:22] purchasing power did that change
[25:24] anything for you or was it like just a
[25:26] different money and not really a
[25:27] behavior change change uh you know what
[25:30] it was like um a change in my
[25:33] Integrity it really Bitcoin is honest
[25:37] hard money right so when you start
[25:40] looking at that then you start looking
[25:41] at well what's Fiat and and and then you
[25:44] go down the rabbit hole of of uh
[25:47] corruption and inflation and the banking
[25:49] sector and you start seeing things and
[25:51] you're like this is evil There's real
[25:54] evil in the world and there's people
[25:56] that will take from you and have no
[25:57] remorse about it so I guess I didn't
[26:01] want to to have a world view that was
[26:05] negative and about evil and that's I
[26:07] guess maybe Bitcoin came into my life
[26:09] and and I could see that Bitcoin was
[26:10] about truth it was about honesty it was
[26:13] about integrity and it was about it was
[26:16] about more than just me it was about all
[26:18] of us it's about rules and not
[26:21] rulers right so I think in that I was
[26:26] like okay well this is good this is a
[26:28] good thing and then it kind of brought
[26:30] me to Jesus which is good his his
[26:33] message is about love and kindness you
[26:35] know go and treat each other as you
[26:37] would treat your your your wife or your
[26:39] brother right be honest even if it's
[26:43] hard and help people help help help okay
[26:46] that's what this world needs is more
[26:48] people willing to help and I don't see
[26:50] that as much I see a lot of people on
[26:52] the sides of the roads with flat tires
[26:54] and nobody helping them and like people
[26:57] not holding the doors for people and and
[27:00] just even saying good morning how you
[27:02] doing you know I when I pull up to my
[27:04] drive-thru window and I'm speaking to
[27:07] someone I don't just spit out my order
[27:09] I'm like yeah give me a bagle and and I
[27:11] say hey how's it going how you doing
[27:12] today and I literally wait for them to
[27:15] answer because I I'm interested on how
[27:17] everybody's doing not just not just my
[27:20] family or like I want to connect with
[27:22] people and I want to and listen to
[27:24] people and actively listen because it's
[27:26] the the best thing you can do is listen
[27:28] to people because then you can find out
[27:30] how Bitcoin would benefit them right if
[27:33] I if I just force my thoughts on you
[27:37] then you're just going to go oh that's
[27:38] his thoughts maybe not but if I listen
[27:39] to you and then I can see well you know
[27:42] this is where Bitcoin can help you it it
[27:45] really it's helped my game this year I
[27:47] love that uh really really cool it's
[27:49] also interesting when when I think about
[27:51] that the the Bitcoin Community aspect uh
[27:55] it's it's amazing that we have uh all
[27:57] those like podcasts uh conferences the
[28:00] local meetups the orange bill apps like
[28:03] the the the the the connection of of
[28:06] actual real human beings that are
[28:08] bitcoiners and we have so many different
[28:10] ways to do that uh and I think that
[28:14] that's quite important what do you think
[28:16] is like how do you feel about the the
[28:18] Bitcoin Community uh uh right now how
[28:21] important is the Bitcoin Community
[28:23] aspect to the Bitcoin itself also it's
[28:27] everything uh I don't know you're on
[28:30] YouTube you're on a few other platforms
[28:32] but the best platform I find is uh
[28:34] Twitter also known as x uh on Twitter we
[28:38] have the best people in the world you
[28:40] know if you want to know anything you
[28:42] can go to bitcoin Twitter and you ask
[28:45] and you'll get an honest to goodness um
[28:48] genuine answer from people and they want
[28:50] you to be healthy like you you look at
[28:53] Bitcoin Twitter is not just about
[28:54] Bitcoin you learn about you know cast
[28:56] iron frying pans and carnivore diet and
[28:59] and you learn about how they're trying
[29:01] to manipulate us and you learn about
[29:03] government corruption and you learn
[29:05] about Fiat and
[29:07] gold it's the community is everything
[29:10] and I find the Bitcoin Community is one
[29:14] of the most genuine right I I my story
[29:17] does include [ __ ] coining uh obviously
[29:19] like I got into Bitcoin through ethereum
[29:22] nfts I got rug pulled on Sheba enu I got
[29:26] rug pulled on and all these tokens and
[29:29] nfts were built on community it's all
[29:32] about the community but looking back it
[29:35] was all about just you know a Ponzi
[29:37] scheme of ripping each other off and it
[29:40] was like it's really sad and and I was
[29:42] glad that it pushed me into Bitcoin
[29:45] where I can like see that bitcoiners are
[29:48] genuinely good people like you Robin
[29:50] you're here on your own dime you know
[29:53] trying to bring truth and honesty to
[29:56] people right like I seen you a year ago
[29:59] when you just started out and this was
[30:00] just about you wanting to immerse your
[30:03] life in Bitcoin and and look what it is
[30:05] giving you this is is a blessing it
[30:08] really is like you can create a life
[30:11] from Bitcoin there's I have bit day
[30:14] cards.com it's a website that I could
[30:16] build a company on bitcoin right just a
[30:19] simple uh teaching people about seed
[30:21] phrases and then that's a way to gift
[30:23] Bitcoin to people but you you could also
[30:26] you set up home mind for people you
[30:29] could build a business where you go in
[30:31] and set up a minor for someone in their
[30:33] garage and and you know they they pay
[30:36] you for that this it's amazing what
[30:38] Bitcoin can offer to people you can't I
[30:41] can't buy Facebook stock and then go and
[30:44] create a Facebook business and try and
[30:46] live off of my Facebook stocks I can't
[30:49] do it with Nike Apple Netflix I can't I
[30:52] can give Netflix a million dollars of
[30:54] stocks but I can't create a Netflix
[30:56] business where if I took a million
[30:58] dollars of Bitcoin and bought it and
[31:01] started learning about it I'd see that
[31:02] there's like 20 different businesses
[31:04] that are need to be created just out of
[31:06] Bitcoin you know Bitcoin backed
[31:08] Insurance Bitcoin backed mortgages
[31:11] mining even going and setting up nodes
[31:13] for people you know creating a
[31:15] Consulting business where you can just
[31:17] you know set up a weekend class where
[31:19] you teach people about Bitcoin it's just
[31:22] the options are endless it's great I L
[31:25] it a lot yeah it's it's interesting how
[31:28] I think a lot of things has also to do
[31:30] because Bitcoin is still so early like
[31:32] we we we have like people compare like
[31:36] Bitcoin to like a stock uh but then
[31:39] they're like no it's actually not a
[31:40] stock like it's an HTTP uh the HTTP HTTP
[31:44] protocol the dcip protocol whatever uh
[31:47] protocol you want to compare it to uh
[31:50] and around that then you can build
[31:52] actually on bitcoin the Facebooks the
[31:55] the Googles and and and so forth which
[31:58] which I think we're just like seeing the
[32:00] the start of of the Bitcoin ecosystem
[32:03] and the the things around that because
[32:06] we will need um uh a lot of lightning
[32:09] networks a lot of scaling Solutions uh
[32:11] payment service provider whatever like
[32:13] we need we need people and companies and
[32:16] institutions and whatever to build on
[32:18] top of Bitcoin the protocol uh and build
[32:21] it out so we are ready for 8 billion
[32:24] people transacting daily on it
[32:28] yep it is definitely coming I seen a
[32:30] clip uh last week and it was I'm not
[32:33] sure if you're familiar with David
[32:34] Letterman he was a talk show host a late
[32:37] night talk show host here and I think
[32:39] the clip came from I I think 1995 is so
[32:44] uh the internet itself had only been
[32:46] around I think for roughly like 15 years
[32:49] so we are at the same spot in the
[32:51] adoption curve uh for Bitcoin both the
[32:55] internet was around for 15 years and
[32:57] Bitcoin today has been around for 15
[32:59] years so on this clip uh someone was
[33:01] explaining to Letterman how uh emails
[33:04] will work in the
[33:05] future and David Letterman goes why
[33:07] would I need to write an email and sit
[33:09] here and hit and type and send it when I
[33:11] can just write with my hand and mail it
[33:13] to the person I want to send it to and
[33:16] you could just see that it's no fault of
[33:18] his own but he had no idea what was
[33:21] coming in the future honestly I've it's
[33:24] 7:30 in the morning here and I've
[33:26] already sent three emails checked it
[33:28] five times you sent me a link for this
[33:30] podcast via email we can't picture our
[33:33] lives without email today it's just you
[33:36] know billions of them are sent every day
[33:39] so this is where we are on the adoption
[33:41] curve for Bitcoin we me and you are
[33:44] immersed in Bitcoin and we still don't
[33:46] even have a clue of where it's going to
[33:47] take us we have no idea the the amount
[33:50] of the wave the Title Wave that's coming
[33:53] right and I hope it takes a long time so
[33:55] I can get cheap Bitcoin for long
[33:59] but I do still want to see the progress
[34:01] move along but just remember the more
[34:03] the price goes up the less corn you get
[34:06] so it's a double-edged short I want to
[34:08] see it go up but I don't want to see it
[34:10] go up I guess we benefit both ways when
[34:12] it goes up we know our purchasing power
[34:15] goes up and when it goes down we know we
[34:16] can buy more uh which will uh benefit
[34:19] our purchasing power long term yes so
[34:22] either way we we we are fine like it's
[34:24] it's a weird thing like uh once it falls
[34:26] it's like ah yes we can buy more Bitcoin
[34:28] and but but I'm also happy when it goes
[34:30] up like I'm happy when the price goes
[34:33] down or up I'm kind of like I mean it
[34:36] just stay stable it's boring yeah but I
[34:38] I think long term um I mean we're not
[34:42] there at all yet so like because we so
[34:44] small but I think at some point Bitcoin
[34:46] will be boring and will mostly do
[34:48] nothing but it will take a very long
[34:51] time till till till we get there until
[34:53] then uh it will be a lot of fun to talk
[34:56] about Bitcoin and and and and have have
[34:59] those great Bitcoin conversations and
[35:00] and see the the Bitcoin price also like
[35:03] as as weird as it sounds a bitcoin price
[35:07] um for Bitcoin does not directly matter
[35:09] but it's really fun to look at it
[35:11] because it's kind of Scoreboard on how
[35:14] well the Feld system is doing against
[35:16] Bitcoin uh for me at least like for me
[35:18] it's like oh Bitcoin will proceed uh how
[35:21] how fast is the field system coming into
[35:23] the Bitcoin system that's the scoreboard
[35:26] for it US dollar is usually the best one
[35:28] because it's the probably the last Fiat
[35:31] system to die and I think it's uh it's a
[35:33] great way uh to to to look at that uh
[35:37] yeah yeah yeah for sure the uh Fiat
[35:40] system is crumbling we know this right
[35:43] so it is interesting to watch the price
[35:45] go up um I was in on family vacation in
[35:50] February the last time Bitcoin lagged up
[35:53] and I looked at my wife and I said just
[35:57] because we save in Bitcoin it just
[36:00] bought us next year's vacation right
[36:02] this is what the purchasing power of
[36:04] Bitcoin does like you can lit like even
[36:09] yesterday I sold a little bit of Bitcoin
[36:12] to buy gas because I'm on a a Bitcoin
[36:14] standard so as soon as I get dollars I
[36:17] convert it to bitcoin and if I need
[36:18] dollars I'll convert back out of Bitcoin
[36:22] right you look today bitcoin's up three
[36:24] and a half per. Robin that tank gas was
[36:28] free if I denominate in Fiat dollars I
[36:33] look at my portfolio today and it's up
[36:35] that tank of gas plus some so you it's
[36:38] weird you see that Bitcoin like if
[36:41] you're good with it and you learn how to
[36:43] manage it it pays it can pay for your
[36:45] life right and and that's I think what
[36:49] the Fiat system should do but we have a
[36:51] small group of Psychopathic individuals
[36:54] that want to hoard all of that uh human
[36:57] Innovation and development to themselves
[36:59] and that would be the government right
[37:02] they have a button on the printer and
[37:04] when they print money they rob us of all
[37:07] this um all this wealth that we create
[37:10] as humans like we're out there working
[37:13] hard I work every day of the week and
[37:15] and I'm creating value and saving in
[37:17] Bitcoin but I'm getting robbed by the
[37:19] government if I leave my money in Fiat
[37:23] and that to me is like it's really great
[37:26] talking point for people I find is uh
[37:28] lately is inflation has been a really
[37:30] good wedge to get people talking about
[37:33] Alternatives and I I found this last six
[37:35] months even though bitcoin price has
[37:37] gone sideways since February people are
[37:40] still becoming more and more intrigued
[37:42] I'm getting more and more people that
[37:43] come up to me and are ask me so you know
[37:46] what is this Bitcoin thing and
[37:48] fortunately I've done the research and
[37:51] I've learned what it is so I have a good
[37:54] uh time explaining it to people it seems
[37:56] to go well and uh I'm finding people are
[37:59] warming up to it more and more so it's a
[38:02] good thing if you watch or listen to my
[38:04] podcast on a regular basis I guess you
[38:06] already bought some Bitcoin and now the
[38:09] most important step is to keep the
[38:12] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware

[39:36] Bitcoin watch that's the perfect subtle
[39:38] elegant way to go out there and show
[39:41] that you are a bitcoiner and that watch
[39:44] brand is Bitcoin only and coin vigilante
[39:48] just dropped a completely new and
[39:50] amazing Genesis edition of their watch
[39:53] collections you have the date of the
[39:56] first ever
[39:57] Bitcoin Block in there and of course
[40:00] also the block height and which EPO we
[40:03] are currently in I love the level of
[40:06] detail they put in in this masterpiece
[40:09] and make sure to check out those amazing
[40:11] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[40:14] descriptions I love those watches so so
[40:17] much yeah it's the it's it's the carrot
[40:20] and the stick method like the the the
[40:23] stick uh in getting into the bit bit
[40:27] coin ecosystem is like the inflation and
[40:29] the pain you get from the field system
[40:31] and the carrot is like oh like the the
[40:33] price is running up and would I imagine
[40:37] next year could be the year where like
[40:39] there's a major stick and a major carrot
[40:41] for people to come into Bitcoin where
[40:43] inflation is is getting out of control
[40:45] and at the same time maybe the the
[40:47] Bitcoin price also uh runs up it's it's
[40:50] an it's really
[40:51] interesting to to watch both things and
[40:54] uh I I like it always when people come
[40:57] because of the carrot so they they're
[40:59] not in pain so like they they can still
[41:01] live their life they they're not in in
[41:03] danger of like getting eaten by the
[41:05] inflation but they feel it still uh
[41:08] because like if if you come because of
[41:10] pure pain of the feat system there's
[41:12] probably some financial problems in your
[41:13] life uh because the inflation is just
[41:15] eating up your your salary and and your
[41:19] salary doesn't grow with your uh grocery
[41:22] shopping list and with your rent and
[41:24] whatever you have to pay so I I I it's
[41:27] usually more uh tragic if if someone
[41:30] comes because of that I prefer it if
[41:31] someone comes actually because ohy this
[41:33] Bitcoin seems to be an interesting thing
[41:36] uh but yeah like both will be a massive
[41:39] driver uh to bitcoin especially I think
[41:41] like in the next like 12 to 18 months if
[41:43] history is and any teacher um what else
[41:47] happened the last uh 10 months uh we
[41:50] mentioned before the the Haring but uh
[41:52] the Bitcoin ETFs also uh happened I
[41:56] think right around when after we we
[41:58] recorded right around after we we
[42:00] published it um how do you uh consider
[42:03] them how bigger is that and and and what
[42:06] do you think changed because of them is
[42:09] that just like the feat wealth that then
[42:11] opens up for Bitcoin or how do you look
[42:14] at them well um I look at them as a as a
[42:17] good thing uh they're going to bring
[42:19] more adoption in right as long as uh you
[42:22] know I know that we had a little bit of
[42:24] unsur there a couple weeks ago with uh
[42:27] Black Rock and do they actually hold the
[42:30] Bitcoin that's they say they do and
[42:32] Brian Armstrong came on Twitter and and
[42:35] there was this whole thing where Black
[42:36] Rock said okay uh we want to settle
[42:39] within 12 hours if we withdraw from our
[42:41] Bitcoin so there was a little bit of
[42:44] unsur but the way that black rock
[42:46] handled it uh gave me confidence they
[42:48] you know they didn't uh beat around the
[42:50] bush they said uh you know let's
[42:53] actually Force coinbase to give us our
[42:55] money in in a shorter time frame which
[42:57] is good right they should have to make
[42:59] make good so that was good that opened
[43:02] up uh people's eyes uh it' be nice if
[43:04] Black Rock gave us the wallet address so
[43:06] we could monitor it ourselves I know the
[43:08] other ETFs they give give you their
[43:11] wallet address so you can track and
[43:12] monitor which is great um here in Canada
[43:16] it's it's actually it's against the
[43:19] bank's Charters to invest in Bitcoin so
[43:23] we have five major Banks up here in
[43:25] Canada uh that's it like we don't have
[43:28] many other Banks or options there's a
[43:30] few Credit Unions but it's very
[43:32] difficult in Canada to become a bank you
[43:34] don't get ones that pop up here and
[43:36] there it's very difficult they're very
[43:38] regulated uh even Tony Robbins in his
[43:40] book on shakable said in the 2008
[43:43] financial crisis that the Canadian Banks
[43:45] were the best Safe Haven in the world
[43:48] for your money so we have a very robust
[43:50] banking system but they're not even
[43:52] allowed to buy Bitcoin it's actually
[43:55] illegal for them so
[43:57] now they can go and buy the ETFs so
[43:59] they're getting exposure to bitcoin you
[44:02] know by proxy through this so that's
[44:04] great thing right that's going to bring
[44:05] more and more adoption in I don't see it
[44:08] being a bad thing uh the more adoption
[44:11] that comes in the the better right I
[44:14] believe in the future you'll see Bitcoin
[44:16] back mortgages I listened to the uh CEO
[44:19] of the fold app he was on a podcast
[44:21] there a week ago and he's talking about
[44:24] how he listens to his customers and and
[44:26] what his customers want and the number
[44:28] one topic they wanted was Bitcoin backed
[44:31] mortgages uh Bitcoin backed car loans so
[44:35] that like people like you and me Rob and
[44:37] that that have all of our wealth saved
[44:39] in Bitcoin it's not recognized by the
[44:41] Fiat world like I can't go get a
[44:43] mortgage and say hey I have 100,000 in
[44:45] Bitcoin the bank will go okay so yeah
[44:47] whatever uh do you have any actual
[44:50] assets and I'll say oh no and they'll be
[44:52] like okay well I can't give you a
[44:53] mortgage but now in the future with
[44:55] Bitcoin back mortgages you can use your
[44:58] Bitcoin as leverage right and that's an
[45:01] amazing tool it's an amazing tool for
[45:04] people like you and me that aren't Elon
[45:06] Musk and can use his you know a billion
[45:09] dollar position in a company as leverage
[45:11] to get a loan right like he bought
[45:13] Twitter X on on Leverage right he had he
[45:17] put up Tesla stock so he could buy a
[45:20] company we can't do that they don't
[45:22] allow us the financial institutions
[45:24] don't allow us that type of access but
[45:26] in the fure future they will if you keep
[45:29] saving in Bitcoin I promise you fold is
[45:32] working on this they're working on
[45:33] getting out uh backed loans which is
[45:36] amazing right for the first time you can
[45:38] use uh a financial tool for leverage
[45:42] it's
[45:44] awesome do do you think that that Fiat
[45:47] system will will always always be around
[45:50] or will we get rid of of of of that
[45:53] thing I mean kind of like loans and
[45:55] stuff like that will still be around I
[45:57] guess in in a in in in a Bitcoin
[45:59] standard world but uh do we ever get rid
[46:01] of that US dollar of that fat world I I
[46:05] don't think in our lifetime I don't
[46:06] think you'll see it maybe not even in
[46:08] our grandchildren's lifetime I think the
[46:11] US dollar is like it's got his hooks dug
[46:14] in and it's going to take a very long
[46:15] time to knock that off its pedestal so I
[46:19] don't think it's really a a topic that
[46:21] we should talk about I think maybe you
[46:24] when your grandchild does a podcast then
[46:26] maybe they'll be talking about that but
[46:27] I think for now it we're pretty strong
[46:30] yeah it's it seems like that it's it's
[46:33] interesting because when I started the
[46:34] podcast I was more on the side of uh no
[46:37] like the fear system will collapse quite
[46:40] quickly and and Bitcoin will
[46:42] prevail but the more I learn about
[46:44] Bitcoin and the deeper and deeper I go
[46:46] I'm like oh [ __ ] like that that fear
[46:47] system is quite strong like the network
[46:50] effect of the fear system it's not
[46:53] something that goes away tomorrow and
[46:55] even like even if we uh for a second
[46:59] think like okay what if the field system
[47:02] goes away like next year or something
[47:05] like that that would not be cool like
[47:07] that would be massive catastrophic event
[47:12] uh which would be maybe good for
[47:16] bitcoiners but it would not be really
[47:18] good for bitcoiners as their family the
[47:21] LOF ones and even themselves suffer
[47:23] because the world will will look like uh
[47:26] [ __ ] for for a long time and we would
[47:28] need a long time to rebuild it so I'm
[47:31] way more of a fan of a very very smooth
[47:33] and slow uh transition of like this is
[47:37] weird uh this this cool uh comparison of
[47:39] like if you have a a ship uh that gets a
[47:44] league you want to let it sink as slowly
[47:48] as possible so everyone has the time to
[47:51] go on the other ship that actually
[47:53] doesn't sink and go on the land or
[47:55] whatever so like if if we imagine Fe as
[47:58] like a ship we don't want to I don't
[48:01] want Bitcoin to get to2 million EUR
[48:04] tomorrow because then the fear system
[48:06] would completely be screwed so that's
[48:10] just like some of my father around te
[48:13] topics I hope I don't see that anytime
[48:17] soon yes yes Robin can I ask you a
[48:20] question I know you're usually the I
[48:22] know you're usually the one asking
[48:24] questions but you've had such a great
[48:26] year like I've got to watch you this
[48:28] whole year and you've and you've like
[48:30] Turned uh you know a 200 view podcasts
[48:33] into this Jugger not of a podcast and
[48:36] it's really been a blessing to watch you
[48:38] grow and watch the things that Bitcoin
[48:40] has brought into your life uh could you
[48:43] tell me the highlight of your year
[48:46] oh um yeah it's it's been a crazy ride
[48:50] uh espe like when when you were on my
[48:52] podcasts I had like 100 to 200 viewer
[48:56] was a weekly so uh that compared to now
[49:02] only on YouTube not comparing any other
[49:04] platforms I have like 70 to
[49:06] 80,000 uh monthly uh audience which is
[49:11] still like massive for me that this is
[49:14] like such a like I cannot even imagine
[49:17] such a huge amount of people on on one
[49:19] spot um and some of the highlights there
[49:22] are two really big ones for me uh
[49:25] because this one was a go goal of mine
[49:27] when I started the podcast because he
[49:29] was the main person that orange buil me
[49:31] with with Michael sailor that he was on
[49:33] my podcast was just like this um stamp
[49:37] of approval of of Bitcoin podcasting and
[49:40] then it was like weird that it was so
[49:42] early and that was like he came on my
[49:45] podcast and he agreed to be on my
[49:46] podcast when I had like 3,000
[49:48] subscribers uh so it was was really
[49:50] early it was not like he did not wait
[49:52] until the podcast is huge and makes more
[49:54] sense for him uh so this also shows like
[49:58] he and he has a major humbleness on on
[50:03] that topic also Jeff po was a major step
[50:06] for me he was kind of the the first
[50:09] bigger guest that that came on my
[50:12] podcast like the first like let's say uh
[50:15] really really big guest that came on my
[50:17] show and he pushed my podcast from like
[50:20] 200 subscribers to like a thousand
[50:22] subscribers um that was huge because I
[50:25] talked with him after the podcast and he
[50:27] kind of encouraged me with the saying of
[50:30] like okay Robin you are spending all
[50:32] your money in Bitcoin but where is your
[50:34] time going and then I was like oh my
[50:36] time is not going to bitcoin my time is
[50:38] going to it Security on all the other
[50:41] topics and I'm like I'm not passionate
[50:43] about it security I'm young I can take
[50:45] the risk I can I should go into where I
[50:48] really want to go and this is where I
[50:51] then went ahead and actually like I
[50:54] think a month or or like one and a half
[50:57] months after I spoke with Jeff I
[50:58] actually quit my job and went full on in
[51:01] Bitcoin podcasting even though back then
[51:05] uh it was not sure that I can even pay
[51:07] my
[51:08] bills the of the podcast because the
[51:10] podcast podcast was still quite quite
[51:13] small yeah but there was one more
[51:15] highlight I want to mention uh I was on
[51:17] the main stage at Bitcoin Amsterdam uh
[51:20] just last week uh and this was an
[51:24] unbelievable highligh for me because
[51:27] this is like wow they actually let me on
[51:30] the main stage in front of like two or
[51:32] 3,000 people uh online also watching so
[51:35] many tens of thousands of people and
[51:37] this is like the a year ago I was
[51:41] watching like uh the the the big bitco
[51:44] conferences and all the big speakers
[51:46] there like a super bowl like a like a
[51:48] major event for me and all of the S A
[51:51] year later I'm I'm myself on that stage
[51:54] so yeah it has been quite a lot for me
[51:56] that's kind of my my my my personal year
[52:00] this has nothing to do with Bitcoin and
[52:02] has all to do with Bitcoin because
[52:03] Bitcoin enabled this the Bitcoin
[52:05] Community enabled this but this is just
[52:07] like my my personal uh year uh for for
[52:11] that that's amazing isn't that a gift
[52:13] from Bitcoin like you've been able to do
[52:15] this just off of you know hard money
[52:19] this is like proof of work right you are
[52:23] proof of work and and that is the
[52:25] backbone of Bitcoin and and I love
[52:27] explaining to people proof of work
[52:30] because they don't understand like uh
[52:32] the mining aspect of Bitcoin and how
[52:34] what what's proof of work right and I
[52:37] say to them I'm like you're proof of
[52:38] work I'm like everything around you is
[52:40] proof of work right we live in this Fiat
[52:43] society that that wants proof of stake
[52:46] if you have money you should get more
[52:48] money that's a Fiat mindset cancer and I
[52:52] and it really I it bothers me like these
[52:55] investors like Warren Buffett that gets
[52:57] like $3 billion a year in just dividends
[53:01] just because he was an early investor
[53:03] and his big pile of money is bigger for
[53:05] some reason he should just get more
[53:07] naturally and it's hard for people to
[53:10] break that mindset and that concept H
[53:13] because they want that people want the
[53:16] easy money but we learn in Bitcoin that
[53:19] if it's easy it's probably a scam right
[53:22] so you need to work hard in life
[53:25] everything has to be proof of work I
[53:27] tell my kids that like I love watching
[53:29] my kids work hard like lifting wood and
[53:31] carrying it and sweating and getting
[53:33] dirty that's life okay the other is
[53:37] cancer that's Fiat so it's great to see
[53:40] you putting in the work and the proof
[53:43] and building this this is amazing when
[53:45] you asked me to come back on I was like
[53:46] absolutely I'd love to have a
[53:48] conversation just to see how your Year's
[53:51] been uh I see you had Dylan llar on uh
[53:54] on Friday he just showed up at your head
[53:56] house was like a knock at the door and
[53:59] here's like one of the biggest guys in
[54:00] Twitter also biggest guys in Bitcoin
[54:03] coming to talk to you like this is I
[54:05] like when I see these things I show my
[54:07] son and he's like Dylan the Clair dad
[54:10] why does Robin want to talk to
[54:12] you I'm like I don't know I'm not too
[54:15] sure he talked to Michael sailor he
[54:18] talked to Jeff Booth Dylan L clerk like
[54:21] you I would love to see you talk to
[54:23] Preston piss next he was the one that
[54:25] orange pill me uh and he's like one of
[54:28] the most uh loyal and honest bitcoiners
[54:31] I find and he has the the greatest
[54:33] Integrity uh so if if anything I would
[54:36] love to see you get Preston pish I'm
[54:38] gonna when when we post this I'm GNA tag
[54:41] him and make sure that you get him yeah
[54:42] I I definitely want him also I want him
[54:46] like my show is split I think in three
[54:51] parts of guests um the the one part is
[54:54] just like a small part of the podcast
[54:57] actually like the Highlight people of
[54:59] like Michael Sailor
[55:01] dlir Jack M down the road Preston Beach
[55:04] like they really like the people that
[55:06] everyone knows in in Bitcoin um this is
[55:09] like the probably the smallest part of
[55:11] the podcast because I do seven a week
[55:13] you cannot feel like so so many in there
[55:17] uh a big part that I'm really proud uh
[55:21] of of doing is getting people that have
[55:23] never ever been on a podcast on my
[55:26] podcast it's around probably like 10 to
[55:29] 20% of my whole podcast is people that
[55:34] have never ever been on any podcast not
[55:36] Bitcoin podcast but no no podcast at all
[55:39] yeah and they they just DM me iame them
[55:43] however we get in contact they're like
[55:45] hey I have this story I really want like
[55:46] to to share in the podcast and I'm like
[55:48] yeah let's try like if it works out we
[55:51] publish it if not uh then we don't uh
[55:54] and there has been some some people
[55:56] uh that I have discovered with that that
[55:58] were just like amazing there was like a
[56:00] science teacher he dm'd me and he was
[56:02] like Hey I have this story I would like
[56:04] to share and I was like yeah let's try
[56:06] it and one of the most successful
[56:08] episodes till now like the top 20
[56:10] episodes or something like that and he
[56:13] had not even an social media account
[56:15] like he was completely uh uh scrapped
[56:18] from from social media and that's kind
[56:21] of what I'm really also proud of giving
[56:24] a stage to uh just PLS that are in the
[56:28] real world not even working in Bitcoin
[56:30] just like being a science teacher or
[56:32] being like an engineer or or some some
[56:35] small entrepreneur and they just want to
[56:37] share their Bitcoin perspective because
[56:39] I think they are like we all heard
[56:42] Michael sailor and Preston Bish and and
[56:44] Jack Ms they're great we all heard them
[56:46] so many times I still want to have them
[56:48] on because it's fascinating you talk to
[56:50] them and you can always learn more yeah
[56:53] uh but for me I'm so excited about just
[56:55] getting someone on that have never been
[56:57] on because you cannot even research them
[56:59] you just go completely blank in a
[57:01] conversation and that's that's an
[57:03] amazing uh feeling and the third
[57:06] category uh is where I try to have
[57:09] people on that have a connection to
[57:11] bitcoin but are not full into Bitcoin
[57:14] for example there's a German company
[57:16] that now does the micro strategy
[57:18] playbook in Germany with offering 30
[57:21] million EUR uh bonds and buying with
[57:24] that Bitcoin and I just saw that and
[57:28] dm'd him hey do you want to jump on the
[57:30] on the podcast he's just a CEO of a a
[57:33] company uh not a a bitcoiner per se but
[57:36] he gets Bitcoin and he wants adopt a
[57:38] Bitcoin strategy in his company and I
[57:40] was like hey he is cool it's that's
[57:42] that's like know the third like he's not
[57:44] a real Bitcoin like he's not entr
[57:46] trenched in the Bitcoin community and
[57:48] speaking all the events but he he gets
[57:51] Bitcoin and he wants to adopt Bitcoin in
[57:54] his life and he achieved something thing
[57:56] cre another uh live so that's kind of
[57:59] the third part of of of my guest sorry
[58:03] for but no I you know what the thing is
[58:05] like have you been on any other podcast
[58:07] Robin yeah actually I've been I have a
[58:10] list like that's maybe also interesting
[58:11] for some of my subscribers uh because I
[58:13] don't repost the podcast I've been on uh
[58:17] directly on the channel but I have um a
[58:19] guest appearance YouTube playlist
[58:22] featured on my YouTube homepage like if
[58:24] you go to my profile and go directly on
[58:27] home there's one playlist where I
[58:31] collect all my guest appearances it's
[58:33] like 18 or 19 now of them uh sometimes
[58:38] it's like a show where more guests are
[58:40] on sometimes it's just me sometimes it's
[58:42] just a recording of a Twitter space uh
[58:44] it's it's been really cool uh to also
[58:47] tell my story yeah um but I didn't share
[58:50] it directly on the channel uh but I have
[58:53] been collecting the YouTube playlist and
[58:55] everyone that is interested in that can
[58:57] just check that out and oh I'm going to
[58:58] find I'm going to find it
[59:01] Rob I'm going to find it I'm going to
[59:03] watch it yeah I like I like learning
[59:05] like I'm the same as you I like I want
[59:07] to learn about these people because you
[59:10] will stumble across uh like a science
[59:12] teacher that will just blow your mind
[59:14] that will change you right it's not like
[59:17] like you said the Michael Sailors the
[59:19] big people they have great messages and
[59:22] and I love listening to them but it's
[59:23] really the small seedlings that have
[59:26] these just nuggets of information that
[59:28] you can really build on like I said I
[59:30] learned about mechanic last week on on
[59:32] Preston's podcast and it's just been
[59:34] like this guy has a way of thinking that
[59:37] I just is amazing and the and the
[59:39] responses he has and the way he
[59:40] communicates is just it's epic right and
[59:43] and I want more of these people in my
[59:45] life right that have truth and integrity
[59:48] and they're trying to do the right
[59:49] things in life even when nobody's
[59:51] looking right because that is the
[59:52] definition of integrity is can you do
[59:55] the right thing when when nobody's
[59:56] watching and and those are the type of
[59:59] people I need in my life because I want
[60:00] to emulate that and and that is a gift
[60:03] of Bitcoin it's amazing like to watch
[60:05] you this whole year and do your thing
[60:07] it's it's been crazy and I'm glad that
[60:09] you told me that there's like a I can
[60:11] learn more about you because you're
[60:12] always the one asking questions you know
[60:15] you're the interviewer I want to see you
[60:16] be the interviewee maybe get a little
[60:18] uncomfortable ask the hard
[60:21] questions I I'm actually uh it's
[60:24] interesting because
[60:26] I actually I'm way more comfortable
[60:29] hosting than being the guest um but I
[60:33] get more comfortable now with being the
[60:35] guest because I have done it now like
[60:37] around 20 times uh so it's been better
[60:41] and better also in in Bitcoin Amsterdam
[60:43] I've been interviewed I think by three
[60:45] people uh with camera just like a quick
[60:48] like five to 10 minutes uh interview uh
[60:51] on on like the the area there because
[60:54] hey I saw your channel let's to quick
[60:56] interview I'm really interested also in
[60:57] in getting those house and seeing them
[60:59] uh being released uh because this was
[61:02] just literally like I just like walk
[61:04] from one stage to another stage uh and
[61:06] in between me watching a show or me
[61:09] watching the stage in Amsterdam guy came
[61:12] up like hey do you have time for five
[61:14] minutes and two questions I'm like yeah
[61:17] okay and just like camera there you go
[61:19] like Z zero preparation nothing you know
[61:22] before just like going going with the
[61:24] flow and yes it's completely
[61:27] uncomfortable um but I always seek the
[61:31] the uncomfort because I think in the
[61:34] uncomfort this is where you grow and for
[61:36] me starting the podcast was really
[61:39] uncomfortable like I I I wasn't born
[61:42] like I was not like oh let's go on
[61:44] camera I want to be seen I want to like
[61:46] that was not me 100% that's why I asked
[61:49] questions that's why I put someone else
[61:51] in the in in the Highlight because
[61:53] that's more me I'm more of a listener
[61:56] less of a of a speaker but I I speak
[61:58] more more because I'm I'm draining that
[62:01] a lot yeah yeah and you're doing much
[62:03] better it's amazing like uh to watch
[62:06] your first few episodes and see you now
[62:08] you're you're very you're very
[62:09] comfortable It comes naturally to you
[62:11] you're doing so well it's amazing to see
[62:13] and it like I'd like to ask you like is
[62:15] it something that takes practice or is
[62:17] it something that you're still just as
[62:19] uncomfortable but you just do it anyways
[62:22] or do you find that your nerves have
[62:24] come down over time oh yeah my nerves
[62:26] have come down completely
[62:28] like um now it's uh my first few
[62:32] episodes were like I prepared like two
[62:36] hours one and a half hour three hours
[62:38] and really tried to research and like oh
[62:40] what question can I ask now I research
[62:45] maybe 20 to 30 minutes and sometimes
[62:48] even like just 10 minutes and I even did
[62:50] some podcast episodes uh where I did not
[62:53] research at all um because I there was
[62:56] nothing to research as with the people
[62:58] that haven't been online um or because I
[63:02] just overlooked the time I was like oh
[63:03] [ __ ] like now I have to podcast now I
[63:05] have to go online um this happened also
[63:07] in so many episodes and I saw that I'm
[63:12] really good in uh just improvising
[63:15] questions and just going with the flow
[63:17] because I have done it so many times I
[63:19] couldn't have done it in the First
[63:20] episodes but now as I've done 280
[63:23] episodes now I can actually do that so
[63:26] you get really good um and also
[63:29] interesting I don't know if you have
[63:31] that but in your mind if you have in
[63:33] your mind something going on like you
[63:35] imagine yourself on a on a stage or
[63:37] something like that I always imagine
[63:39] myself speaking really good uh then you
[63:42] go on stage and you're like oh [ __ ] I
[63:44] don't speak as good as I'm speaking in
[63:46] my dreams yeah and and and I found
[63:50] myself uh closing that gap between uh
[63:55] how I met imag being speaking on on on a
[63:58] podcast and and speaking on a stage uh
[64:00] versus how I actually do because I think
[64:04] the the true that your true self your
[64:07] integrity uh your honesty comes out more
[64:10] like you need to be comfortable to be
[64:12] honest with yourself to be an in integer
[64:14] person because if you're like stressed
[64:16] you're not really
[64:17] yourself and that come that goes
[64:20] completely over time uh and yeah now I
[64:24] can just like have like a major person
[64:27] like Dyan Clair in my apartment and I'm
[64:29] not stressing up awesome so so I'm still
[64:33] nervous but I'm not stressing out so
[64:34] like that's definitely something with
[64:36] with with with practice that goes away
[64:39] uh yeah really really cool there yeah
[64:41] it's been a real pleasure Robin watching
[64:42] you this year like uh I love putting on
[64:45] your podcast and just listening to your
[64:46] guys conversations whoever you may be
[64:48] interviewing and I thank you for
[64:49] allowing me to be on like like I say
[64:51] you've interviewed the biggest and now
[64:53] you've interviewed the worst
[64:58] you were at the top now you're down at
[64:59] the bottom all right scraping the bottom
[65:02] of the
[65:03] barrel Tommy Boy
[65:06] Ah that's
[65:08] good no I actually like it's an
[65:11] interesting question of like who can I
[65:14] in uh invite like for second podcast and
[65:16] third podcast uh I just enjoyed our
[65:19] conversation so much and I was like yeah
[65:20] let's let's invite him back on and I
[65:22] also look at some metrics of like how
[65:24] long did the viewers watch did they like
[65:26] all opt out at like 5 minutes or like
[65:29] did they watch like on average 12 or 13
[65:31] or 15 minutes which is a good average
[65:33] food aration uh and I just saw like
[65:35] first of all I enjoyed it a lot with you
[65:37] but I saw that uh your podcast was one
[65:41] of the first that uh people really
[65:43] watched for a long time wow so that gave
[65:46] me Al an indicator that people actually
[65:49] like to listen to you uh because the
[65:52] average F duration was is up
[65:54] significantly to to some of the other
[65:56] early ones and most of this has has also
[66:00] to do like my interview style has going
[66:02] better so people now watch in general a
[66:04] little bit longer uh but you were like
[66:06] the early ones that was has a really
[66:08] good average fation has has all to do
[66:10] with you uh so that's like I I really
[66:13] wanted to to have you back on because I
[66:17] loved our conversation and the audience
[66:19] uh lik it too obviously so that was a
[66:22] great great match that's cool I think I
[66:24] think when you're passion about
[66:25] something it just comes out of you and
[66:28] then that attracts people and I find
[66:31] with me or you me and you were very
[66:33] passionate about Bitcoin like I'm not
[66:35] just buying you know my DCA weekly and
[66:39] just you know going and doing the rest
[66:41] of my Fiat life like I literally when
[66:43] I'm not taking care of my kids and being
[66:46] my family I'm digesting as much
[66:48] information as I can about Bitcoin
[66:51] because I realize what it actually is
[66:53] it's you know it's decentralized it's
[66:56] immutable it's permissionless money and
[66:58] the the the the things that it offers
[67:01] people far away any other Financial
[67:04] instrument in this world like it gives
[67:06] you the ability to say if you were um
[67:10] say you're in Palestine or or um Israel
[67:14] right now or whatnot and you're in a war
[67:15] torn country and you're a wealthy person
[67:18] like Bitcoin for the first time you can
[67:20] travel over borders with a 12-word seed
[67:23] phrase in your head like that's amazing
[67:25] to me is like you could be have a
[67:28] million dollars in Bitcoin and the
[67:30] regime changes in your town or your
[67:32] village and you have to flee and alls
[67:34] you need is 12 words and you can go and
[67:37] and and recoup your wealth and that's
[67:40] what I urge people to do uh if anything
[67:43] is you should try and recover uh a
[67:45] wallet from the seed phrase it it's a
[67:48] really powerful thing I did it with a
[67:51] person I'm trying to teach about Bitcoin
[67:54] uh recently like I said my niece
[67:55] boyfriend well I donated I gave my niece
[67:58] Bitcoin for Christmas and it sat there
[68:01] uh and I actually I gave her $60 in
[68:03] Bitcoin December 2023 it's actually
[68:06] worth $85 right now so I urge anybody to
[68:10] look at what you got your family for
[68:11] Christmas and you see if it's still as
[68:14] valuable as when you bought it or if
[68:16] it's less right that's what I like about
[68:18] Bitcoin is I gift it to you and it
[68:20] increases in value over time so it's an
[68:23] amazing thing her Bitcoin had
[68:25] appreciated and value well her boyfriend
[68:28] was getting into Bitcoin and I said
[68:29] Jackson why don't you try and recover
[68:33] Hannah's Bitcoin via her seed phrase and
[68:35] he didn't know how to do it and so I
[68:37] took him through the steps of going into
[68:39] blue wallet importing a wallet typing
[68:41] the seed phrase in and then boom the
[68:44] bitcoin's on his phone it's not on his
[68:46] phone but he has access to the Bitcoin
[68:49] he's like wow I I could see his first
[68:52] text back to me was wow and like that is
[68:54] an eye opening moment for people when
[68:56] they can use the seed phrase to recover
[68:59] funds so that in closing if if anything
[69:01] I'd urge people to run a node recover
[69:04] your seed phrase uh once and and find an
[69:07] old minor an S9 minor on Marketplace and
[69:10] although you're not going to make money
[69:11] at it you're going to learn what it's
[69:13] like to contribute hash rate to the
[69:15] network it's it's a really empowering
[69:18] thing I I love that a lot really really
[69:21] cool uh and I think that's a a great way
[69:24] to also to end the podcast I have two
[69:26] more questions the one question is now
[69:28] uh I did that after um I think around
[69:31] episode 50 or something like that I
[69:33] introduced that uh new method of ending
[69:35] the podcast where I asked one question
[69:38] is always the same question uh what can
[69:40] we learn from you besides Bitcoin
[69:44] uh actually um I did I had posted in the
[69:48] past I am like a mechanic so I'm a mill
[69:51] right so I do fix things I have posted
[69:54] uh on my Twitter about taking apart my
[69:56] dryer uh you know the the dryer broke
[69:58] down in my house and instead of calling
[70:01] a repair man uh I fixed it myself and I
[70:04] posted all the progress on Twitter uh I
[70:08] changed the lights on my house yesterday
[70:11] and uh I I'm going to post that and show
[70:14] people how to you know try and save
[70:16] money because I try and do all my
[70:17] repairs around the house myself um I'd
[70:22] like people to learn about God through
[70:24] me I would love someone someone to DM me
[70:26] and say you know what like after hearing
[70:28] you on the podcast I took a look at the
[70:29] Bible and I took a look at the Jesus's
[70:32] life and I started learning about it and
[70:34] that to me would be it would almost
[70:37] probably make me cry if you want to make
[70:39] Tommy Boy cry you DM me and say that you
[70:42] know what Jesus is has come into my life
[70:44] and and that's because of you and maybe
[70:47] that's that's how I want to close that
[70:49] question I love that a lot yeah really
[70:51] really cool then our tin that I have I
[70:53] think since the first podcast actually
[70:55] um the where the previous guest is
[70:57] asking a question for the next guest
[70:58] without knowing who the next guest
[70:59] actually is um how will Bitcoin affect
[71:03] romantic relationships in the future I
[71:06] thought that that question was
[71:08] interesting
[71:09] wow um do you know what really that is
[71:12] actually a good question uh it's not one
[71:15] you would expect so it really forces you
[71:16] to think on the fly but um I think it
[71:21] will affect um it will affect
[71:24] relationships some in a positive way and
[71:26] some in a negative way right there's not
[71:28] going to be one box that you can put
[71:29] this question in I I think it's very
[71:32] important that if you are in a
[71:33] relationship that you should both have
[71:35] the same ideas uh and be on the same
[71:37] page with Bitcoin my wife she
[71:40] understands Bitcoin not maybe at the
[71:42] level I do but she understands what it's
[71:45] trying to solve for uh you know
[71:47] corruption uh
[71:49] inflation uh censorship government
[71:52] overreach like those things me and my
[71:55] wife are on the same page about and and
[71:58] that is just an an umbrella over top of
[72:01] it is Bitcoin so if you and your partner
[72:04] aren't on the same page as with Bitcoin
[72:06] if one thinks it's a scam and the other
[72:08] thinks it's the greatest thing since
[72:09] sliced bread it is going to cause some
[72:12] tension in the relationship so I think
[72:14] you should both be on the same page it
[72:17] will affect relationships I think just
[72:18] like politics right like you could have
[72:21] a trump supporter and a Harris supporter
[72:24] and these people are fighting I know
[72:26] people at work that that lost um spouses
[72:29] over the covid vaccine one the husband
[72:32] didn't want to get it and the wife did
[72:34] and and it literally tore marriages
[72:36] apart I'm like it breaks my freaking
[72:39] heart you know and I know people that it
[72:40] did this too and uh I think Bitcoin is
[72:44] going to fall in the same class as that
[72:46] yeah that that that's true it can really
[72:50] uh like if you're really a hardcore
[72:52] bitcoiner and she really thinks it's a
[72:54] scam then then I think it can really
[72:56] negatively impact that as other big and
[72:59] huge topics I'm very grateful that my
[73:01] girlfriend supports that yes yes I know
[73:04] me too Robin we don't know how grateful
[73:06] yeah we don't know how blessed we are
[73:07] that our our partners uh will listen to
[73:10] us cuz I know we just talk about Bitcoin
[73:12] non-stop the poor
[73:15] things tell tell your girlfriend I'm
