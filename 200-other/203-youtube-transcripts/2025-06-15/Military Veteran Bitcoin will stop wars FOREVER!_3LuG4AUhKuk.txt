[00:00] for 20 years in Iraq and Afghanistan and
[00:03] I don't recall ever having any kind of
[00:04] vote do you think that Bitcoin is
[00:06] actually defunding Wars in my time in
[00:08] Iraq I really saw what they talk about
[00:10] the unbanked where they have no way to
[00:13] really save money there was no banking
[00:15] system and this is after the wars where
[00:17] the whole place was just destroyed
[00:19] everything was destroyed people were
[00:21] living day to day in some cases hour to
[00:23] hour K could bring the free market
[00:26] competition to nation states can't just
[00:28] steal someone's Bitcoin unless you have
[00:30] their seat frease so violence isn't
[00:32] going to persuade people to just give up
[00:35] their their seat frease and take it away
[00:36] from them or it can't be confiscated by
[00:38] a third party it's your way of
[00:40] protecting yourself protecting your
[00:42] family and hopefully developing hope for
[00:44] the future if we have something backed
[00:46] by Bitcoin I think it takes the power
[00:48] out of politicians hands where they can
[00:50] do whatever they want without
[00:52] representation of the people early
[00:53] Construction in the US a lot of the
[00:55] buildings that were built in the 40s and
[00:57] 50s are still standing but the ones that
[00:58] are being built now fall apart so
[01:00] quickly if I'm looking at these prices
[01:02] like this is ridiculous I'm paying this
[01:03] much for bread and eggs and milk like I
[01:05] feel for the families who are barely
[01:07] getting
[01:11] by you wrote me in the preparation that
[01:14] you uh saw firsthand in aric what
[01:19] unbanked means yeah and first of all
[01:22] like what did you saw there what was the
[01:24] experience there and then let's get into
[01:26] this whole thing with uh Wars and and
[01:29] unbanked and and what Bitcoin can do
[01:32] yeah so I read um I think it was Alex
[01:34] gl's book the um check your financial
[01:39] privilege and among many of the other
[01:41] books right Bitcoin uh standard Fiat
[01:44] standard I mean broken money could go on
[01:46] and on and on and what you hear a lot of
[01:50] times especially in United States is
[01:52] there's no use case which I I fully
[01:55] disagree with and I think some of that
[01:58] comes down to you know in the United
[02:01] States we all have Banks we a lot of you
[02:02] know credit cards Banks there's a
[02:04] savings technology that we kind of
[02:07] use uh in my time in Iraq I really saw
[02:11] what they talk about the in unbanked
[02:13] where they have no way to really save
[02:16] money there was no banking system um and
[02:19] this is after the wars there is during
[02:21] the wars and kind of afterwards right
[02:22] where the whole place was just destroyed
[02:26] everything was destroyed people were
[02:28] living dayto day in some cases our hour
[02:31] and there was really no hope for saving
[02:33] money or using money that wasn't going
[02:36] to be easily confiscated by you know a
[02:40] criminal element whether it's just theft
[02:43] itself or through any kind of Insurgency
[02:47] or local terrorist group or whatever the
[02:49] case was and so any money we were
[02:51] putting in to try to help the community
[02:54] would you know could easily have been
[02:56] confiscated by um leaders Warlords and
[02:59] and kind of leave the people themselves
[03:01] to have nothing and and from what I
[03:04] found was if you don't have hope for a
[03:07] future you don't have a way to save and
[03:09] help your family what do you do um and
[03:13] and having Bitcoin where you have you
[03:16] can be your own bank you can secure your
[03:18] own funds and like Max Kaiser has
[03:21] mentioned it's it's the a peaceful
[03:23] Revolution because you can't just steal
[03:26] someone's Bitcoin unless you have their
[03:28] seed frease right so violence isn't
[03:30] going to persuade people to just give up
[03:33] their their seed phrase and take it away
[03:35] from them or it can't be confiscated by
[03:38] a third party um it's it's it's your way
[03:41] of protecting yourself protecting your
[03:43] family and hopefully developing hope for
[03:46] the future where you can kind of secure
[03:48] your own future you can secure your own
[03:50] business you can secure your own wealth
[03:52] for your family um long term and I think
[03:56] you know that was something I noticed
[03:58] firsthand when survival was your only
[04:00] Instinct going from day to day to feed
[04:02] your family uh and you have no income
[04:06] you have no employment because there's
[04:08] no jobs everything is destroyed what do
[04:11] you do and and survival takes over
[04:13] instead of looking forward to you know
[04:16] developing your long-term wealth or even
[04:18] just taking care of your family on the
[04:20] long term and passing that on to
[04:22] them yeah and even like when we come to
[04:25] those topics where we have uh sound
[04:28] money and low time preference money we
[04:31] have like I don't know like the the best
[04:34] shitcoin in the world is probably the
[04:36] Swiss
[04:37] frank uh and and they live a little bit
[04:40] longer like it it seems like they're not
[04:43] that hectic they're a little bit U more
[04:46] Forward Thinking uh and uh I mean you
[04:49] can also make the argument that the US
[04:50] dollar is the best best shitcoin in the
[04:52] world it depends on on how how you
[04:54] define and how you look at it um but
[04:56] it's it's really interesting for me to
[04:58] to to look at those and then when you
[05:00] look at countries where we have high
[05:02] inflation over 100% or closer to 200%
[05:05] with like turkey Argentina all of the oh
[05:08] Argentina I think got a little bit
[05:10] better like right now but they still
[05:11] have really high inflation in general uh
[05:14] and there's so many places Lebanon was
[05:16] also a great example um there are so
[05:19] many examples of that where when we have
[05:21] all of the sudden really broken money
[05:24] and I love the book from Lyn Alden by
[05:26] the way I really hope to to have her on
[05:28] the podcast at some point because her
[05:30] book was really really good about broken
[05:32] money uh when we have broken money this
[05:35] makes something with Society this does
[05:37] something with your brain this does
[05:39] something with with your behavior and
[05:41] this changes something how do you how do
[05:44] you see that when when we have like when
[05:46] we imagine now a Bitcoin standard where
[05:48] war is or like first let's go there like
[05:52] uh do you think uh that Bitcoin is
[05:54] actually defunding Wars and and can
[05:56] actually um stop or limit Wars in
[06:01] certain extents I I think it's a great
[06:02] point and I think part of that it mean
[06:05] it's difficult to say without seeing it
[06:07] in practice but with Fiat where you can
[06:11] continuously just print money and feed
[06:16] what I would call Forever War um I I
[06:19] think Bitcoin could stop that or at
[06:22] least mitigate it the best possible
[06:26] because I'll be honest with you as we're
[06:28] going through and as these wars going on
[06:30] a lot of times in just my experience a
[06:31] lot of it was you know we are told
[06:33] something and we feel patriotic and
[06:35] we're like we need to be a part of this
[06:37] to try to solve this but then as you go
[06:39] through it and this is from my point of
[06:42] view right um you start to realize like
[06:44] well what are we doing like what is the
[06:46] what is the end state that we're trying
[06:48] to achieve here are we trying to stay
[06:51] here forever was was there a is there a
[06:53] goal to all this you know are we trying
[06:56] to Nation build are we trying to you
[06:58] know Li you know what are we trying to
[07:00] do and it seemed like somewhere a lot of
[07:02] that got lost and it and it just
[07:04] continued to be well we're just going to
[07:06] continue to print money to continue
[07:07] funding it and it kind of threw me off
[07:11] because I'm looking at this and you know
[07:13] we were 20 years or so in Iraq and
[07:17] Afghanistan and I don't recall ever
[07:20] having any kind of vote you know do we
[07:22] raise taxes to continue supporting this
[07:24] do we you know we're in all this
[07:27] inflation to support these wars like I
[07:30] don't know how much money went into
[07:32] funding these um but I'm sure it's in
[07:36] the trillions and I feel like you can
[07:39] apply this to probably anywhere around
[07:41] the world if there was a vote on raising
[07:44] taxes and they called it I don't know
[07:47] the whatever war tax and there was a
[07:50] vote I I would imagine that the majority
[07:54] of people or a certain percentage of the
[07:56] people at least wouldn't vote for that
[07:59] tax you know what is this money going
[08:01] toward why are we doing this okay if
[08:04] we're going to do this what what is our
[08:07] goal what is the end State what what
[08:11] identifies a point where we have
[08:12] achieved whatever the the goal is and
[08:15] how do we transition out what is the
[08:17] plan um and I think a lot of people you
[08:20] know maybe at first they' be like all in
[08:22] because of the Patriotic and they're
[08:24] like hey this is the right thing to do
[08:26] but I think as longer it goes and I
[08:28] could tell you as anyone who's ever been
[08:30] to war the vast majority of us do not
[08:34] like War the losing your friends losing
[08:37] family members the scene of Destruction
[08:39] that occurs on all sides uh so it's hard
[08:43] for me sometimes when I when I hear
[08:45] people who are calling for war and
[08:46] continuous bombings and everything else
[08:48] and the the lives lost the children the
[08:51] families having seen that firsthand it's
[08:54] it's really it's hard for me to
[08:56] accept that people are so like War
[08:58] hungry at times um I think they take the
[09:01] I think they take the big picture of
[09:03] losses that occur um for granted like
[09:06] they throw numbers out there like it's
[09:08] no big deal like oh well they've lost
[09:10] you know 30,000 people that's that's
[09:13] 30,000 people who have been killed right
[09:17] um or you know and I think from from my
[09:20] point of view it's
[09:22] been we haven't in the United States you
[09:25] know haven't seen that many casualties
[09:28] and we we lost five 5,000 or so a little
[09:30] bit 6,000 soldiers in Iraq and
[09:32] Afghanistan and know and then the
[09:34] numbers Wise It's significantly less
[09:36] than like World War II right or even
[09:39] Vietnam but for someone who's lived
[09:41] through it that's like 5,000 of my
[09:43] friends and families and the wives and
[09:46] husbands and children who won't see
[09:47] their their family again and that that's
[09:50] hard to that's hard to deal with and so
[09:53] I am somebody who looks at it and says
[09:56] hey have we looked at every possible way
[09:58] to solve something diplomatically before
[10:01] we go into and try to initiate a war and
[10:05] the lives that going to be lost because
[10:06] of this and I think with Bitcoin
[10:09] whenever it's not something that can be
[10:11] just Mass created doesn't matter how
[10:13] much time or energy you put into it
[10:15] Bitcoin will still work like you say Tik
[10:17] Tok next block there's only going to be
[10:19] so much created and if far if we have
[10:21] something backed by Bitcoin or is it
[10:23] Bitcoin is our legal tender I think it
[10:26] takes the power out of politicians hands
[10:29] where they can do whatever they
[10:32] want
[10:33] without representation of the people
[10:36] first having a have a voice in this
[10:38] system um so I I think that's where it
[10:41] could go where it could be more of a
[10:43] peaceful Revolution not saying there's
[10:46] never G to ever be a Wars again because
[10:48] I think that's might be shortsighted
[10:51] because I think no matter what there's
[10:52] always going to be conflict one way or
[10:54] another but I think this is a way of
[10:56] potentially limiting it um so that you
[10:59] don't have these Wars the last 20 30
[11:01] years um and just continue to get
[11:04] funded yeah and it's a great point
[11:07] because when you have a war that's going
[11:10] on for a long time and you have a
[11:12] military intervention somewhere else or
[11:15] War whatever it's going on um you would
[11:18] assume that the populus the general
[11:20] populus is standing behind the war but
[11:23] on a Fiat standard that's not the case
[11:25] because they can like a small group of
[11:27] people can uh decide if there is a war
[11:30] or not and they don't have to ask the
[11:33] population if they even want to fight
[11:36] this like uh Vladimir Putin did not ask
[11:41] a vote for all the Russians oh do you
[11:43] really want to fight the Ukraine for
[11:45] that uh so there's like no vote for that
[11:48] it's like a small group of people or
[11:50] maybe even like one person depending on
[11:52] on where you live um who just decides oh
[11:55] yeah I want to make war right now uh and
[11:59] and this sometimes is even uh profitable
[12:04] to do that and it makes it makes sense
[12:06] for for economic reasons and like this
[12:09] this this not this is not good and when
[12:11] we flip that around and we on a Bitcoin
[12:13] standard or sound money standard
[12:16] everyone has to like the government has
[12:19] to uh agree like they have to get the
[12:23] votes and they have to get the taxes
[12:26] from the people if they don't get the
[12:27] taxes and they don't get the V uh other
[12:31] government could actually rise up inside
[12:33] of the country and get um better and
[12:37] more powerful who is against the wars
[12:40] and who is against the things like we
[12:42] Bitcoin could bring the free market
[12:45] competition to nation states which would
[12:49] be really interesting to see I have no
[12:51] clue how this looks that's why I always
[12:53] ask my guests because I myself have no
[12:56] clue what what those things but it's an
[12:58] interesting F experiment yeah no and you
[13:01] know I would say the a lot of from what
[13:04] I've
[13:05] seen most people are just trying to like
[13:08] get by survive live their lives create a
[13:11] healthy you know good family life um
[13:15] save for the future
[13:18] and it so like you said it's not it's
[13:21] not everyone in that in a certain
[13:22] country is feeling this way and
[13:24] supporting you know is the enemy of
[13:27] somebody else right um and there
[13:30] majority of people are just good people
[13:32] who want to survive make a living and
[13:34] raise a family and I think with Bitcoin
[13:36] too that that kind of What attracted me
[13:39] to it was obviously the decentralization
[13:41] of it U you know it's unconfiscatable
[13:44] really but also the time preference
[13:48] aspect of it like what can we do to make
[13:52] our world better not just for us um it
[13:55] takes the selfishness out of it right
[13:57] like I I look at the Bitcoin I have and
[14:00] you know and when it went up to like you
[14:03] know in the 70s not too long ago in on
[14:07] US dollar value if everyone oh sell it
[14:11] sell it you know but I that's not what I
[14:15] I'm looking at what I'm looking at is
[14:17] like I have this and this is an asset
[14:20] that I plan on passing down to my kids
[14:22] and then hopefully they pass it down to
[14:24] their kids and the better the lifestyle
[14:28] they have and the more secure and the
[14:31] safer and just overall everything about
[14:34] their life like you see those pictures
[14:36] on the internet right with especially ex
[14:39] where there's like a family and a
[14:41] beautiful farm and you know they're
[14:43] living a happy life and it's not really
[14:45] focused on immediate satisfaction
[14:48] immediate gratification it's focused on
[14:50] long-term support and development and
[14:53] you know when that really caught my
[14:56] attention you know obviously I read
[14:58] Bitcoin standard and that was great but
[15:01] when I read Fiat
[15:03] standard that opened my eyes from
[15:06] everything from construction to health
[15:08] care to food to you know just everyday
[15:11] way of life and I think that book more
[15:15] than anything help me you know flip the
[15:18] switch to get away from the immediate
[15:21] gratification side to long-term longtime
[15:25] preference um how can we make the world
[15:27] better how can we make the better how
[15:29] can we make agriculture how can we make
[15:32] businesses what can we do to make
[15:33] everything better for the long term so I
[15:35] I really I really credit um safine am
[15:39] book um the Fiat standard for really
[15:42] flipping that switch uh for me do you
[15:44] think that we often say like Bitcoin is
[15:47] a peaceful
[15:49] Revolution um do you think it will be
[15:52] peaceful it will be like we basically
[15:54] when we are spinning that F further I
[15:57] mean there are different camps inside of
[15:59] Bitcoin uh like the mic s approach is
[16:02] like oh the US dollar and everything
[16:04] will still be there we just have the
[16:06] option to also have this this great
[16:09] store of value uh but there are also
[16:11] this uh camp like oh Bitcoin will
[16:14] actually strip the power completely away
[16:16] from the government and separate money
[16:18] from State and there will only be
[16:20] Bitcoin and no other fear currencies uh
[16:23] and then there are a lot of things in
[16:25] between there yeah um but when we go in
[16:28] this direction ction where in in both
[16:31] cases government will have less and less
[16:33] power depending on like how much less
[16:35] power they kind of probably fight for it
[16:39] they kind of will do something against
[16:41] it or they will join it more and more as
[16:44] as Salvador now does it so it's it's
[16:46] interesting how the transition time will
[16:48] go but do you imagine the transition
[16:50] time being actually
[16:52] peaceful I think so in the so to term
[16:56] peaceful
[16:59] it could be you know how do we how do we
[17:01] want to Define that right because I
[17:03] don't think I don't think um like
[17:07] physical violence and Wars but I think
[17:11] there will be significant push back
[17:13] whether it's through
[17:15] media
[17:16] um you know the the governments you
[17:20] could say governments of the world right
[17:22] because if it becomes like a world kind
[17:23] of tender um they're they probably have
[17:26] a lot to lose unless they get
[17:29] early on this and start you know
[17:31] stacking now right um so I think there
[17:33] will be significant push back I think
[17:35] there'll be significant money dedicated
[17:38] to making sure or making sure that if it
[17:42] does come it is as delayed as
[17:45] possible um to give them opportunities
[17:48] to still find footing in this um so
[17:52] violently I don't think so I think
[17:55] through media and suppression I think is
[17:57] definitely probably on the table but I I
[18:01] also think that and I would go toward so
[18:04] I read also read Brian De mint's book um
[18:07] parallel the unlocking the the social
[18:10] structure of Bitcoin I think it's
[18:12] interesting to say that if we had a
[18:13] parallel kind of environment where you
[18:17] know you are able to kind of use the
[18:21] tender either dollars or wherever your
[18:23] country's you know currency is and
[18:27] Bitcoin um kind of of at the same time
[18:30] you whatever you want to use as long as
[18:32] you're willing to accept it I think that
[18:34] has a probably a greater chance of
[18:37] especially the next couple 10 or so
[18:39] years I think um I think for us to say
[18:44] that it's probably way too early and
[18:46] this is just my opinion to say that
[18:49] it'll be
[18:50] used as the global money
[18:54] exclusively I don't know if that will
[18:56] ever happen I'm not as inform wared they
[18:59] in the loop of people who who probably
[19:01] who are much more knowledgeable on that
[19:02] than I am um but I I do see a parallel
[19:06] where you could use either as a legal
[19:08] form of money as long as it's accepted
[19:11] and what I've tried to do even I started
[19:13] my own um website where you can you know
[19:16] Bitcoin clothing and this hat is not I
[19:18] don't make this hat this is uh Sergio
[19:20] Bermudez he makes these Bitcoin hats and
[19:23] this is obviously El Salvador and
[19:25] Bitcoin um he lives in Miami and he
[19:28] makes these are high quality hats he
[19:30] makes but um so I have to give him a
[19:32] shout out there but I have my website
[19:36] and you can buy Bitcoin clothing you can
[19:38] buy Bitcoin themed um like phone cases
[19:42] or speakers you can buy pretty much
[19:45] anything you can think of Bitcoin
[19:47] related uh or just customade stuff that
[19:50] you request from my store and we can
[19:52] make it as well uh it doesn't have to be
[19:55] Bitcoin but we accept Bitcoin as payment
[19:59] or we accept you know dollar or whatever
[20:02] currency for your Country Credit we we
[20:04] accept everything and so I think a
[20:07] slower adoption where it just becomes
[20:09] another means of acceptance of of money
[20:11] uh to transact I think is um probably
[20:16] where we'll head the next couple years
[20:19] um but there's also pushback and when I
[20:23] interviewed Brian dmin about this too
[20:25] was on one hand you have those who think
[20:30] spending and using it as tender I mean
[20:34] he makes the point you know the white
[20:35] paper was a peer-to-peer transaction
[20:37] right um and then those who say you just
[20:41] buy and hold because why would you ever
[20:43] spend it because it's going to continue
[20:44] to grow in value uh so there to me
[20:48] there's like two different camps I don't
[20:49] know who's right um but I think
[20:52] initially it's going to be more than
[20:54] likely kind of like a parallel growth is
[20:57] is my opinion
[20:59] I don't think that we we need to spend
[21:02] our Bitcoin to be
[21:03] successful uh like there's there's the
[21:07] theoretical side of it and there's the
[21:10] side of it that's ideology and and oh of
[21:14] course I want to spend my Bitcoin I only
[21:15] want to live on bitcoin but there's a
[21:17] practical side to it I for example live
[21:19] in Austria every time I spend Bitcoin I
[21:22] have to pay taxes
[21:24] 27% um I'm not doing that right
[21:29] so I rather earn my
[21:32] fear put aside that what I need for the
[21:34] month and the rest I put in Bitcoin
[21:36] don't touch my Bitcoin don't spend uh
[21:39] don't pay taxes when I buy a
[21:43] coffee I say coffee but I never drink a
[21:46] coffee but you get my point it's like
[21:48] whatever I buy uh I I don't uh spend
[21:52] taxes on that because it's it's
[21:53] ridiculous to spend always taxes on on
[21:56] on what you spend but if you live in El
[21:59] Salvador and you can pretty much spend
[22:02] everywhere your Bitcoin it's not fully
[22:04] flashed like there are stores where they
[22:06] don't accept Bitcoin you have to onboard
[22:09] them it's it's not like there 100%
[22:11] adoption there probably like 25 or 30%
[22:13] of adoption of merchants depending on
[22:15] what area you live but you can find all
[22:18] your vendors like you can find your hair
[22:20] cutter and your grocery store where you
[22:22] can pay with Bitcoin and then if you get
[22:25] also your salary in Bitcoin then it's
[22:27] easy then you just live in Bitcoin and
[22:29] that's great that's an amazing world and
[22:31] I love to be there but and that's that's
[22:34] the thing what Bitcoin has also do
[22:37] sometimes they put their own values and
[22:39] their own beliefs on bitcoin and they're
[22:41] like oh yes I only eat meat that's why
[22:44] you Bitcoin also should only eat meat I
[22:47] spend my Bitcoin that's why you also
[22:49] should uh like Bitcoin is a very diverse
[22:51] and very broad group already even though
[22:54] we are so early and so small um and we
[22:57] should not like say like this is a
[23:00] Bitcoin like there there's no such a
[23:02] thing as a bitcoiner there's just
[23:04] Bitcoin and then you can hold it and
[23:06] then then you are a Bitcoin but we
[23:08] cannot Define that I see I see that
[23:11] sometimes that people are like oh why
[23:13] are you doing that yeah well I I agree
[23:16] and I think that and and for myself I
[23:18] would say that maybe it's just through
[23:21] just my life experiences I try not to
[23:23] put any expectations on anyone um you
[23:27] know how you live your life how you live
[23:28] your life right uh how you choose to
[23:32] spend your money save your money invest
[23:34] your money um your opinion might be
[23:37] different than mine right and and you
[23:40] could spread that across however many
[23:42] people like I I interviewed my my cousin
[23:44] who has a pretty heavy investment
[23:47] background in finance and a degree uh
[23:50] runs a part of a pretty big insurance
[23:53] company here and we we talked about
[23:57] diversification and I know there's no
[23:59] second there's no second best asset
[24:01] right but I would when I would talk to
[24:04] people about Bitcoin I don't tell them
[24:08] go all in on bitcoin I feel that I I
[24:12] tell them to research Bitcoin I tell
[24:14] them to study Bitcoin and Bitcoin is
[24:16] different for everybody um and there's
[24:19] there's I don't think there's any way
[24:21] that I will ever know everything there
[24:23] is to know about Bitcoin because every
[24:26] day it seems like there's something new
[24:27] coming out
[24:29] um and but I I do recommend on my side
[24:34] people research it because for a long
[24:37] time you know I I don't remember when
[24:39] you got into Bitcoin overall but I heard
[24:43] about it early probably I want to say
[24:46] 2012
[24:47] 2013 and I it didn't really register
[24:51] what it was being talked about and a lot
[24:54] of that is my fault because I didn't do
[24:55] the research um and then about years ago
[25:00] uh I had some more free time on my hands
[25:03] and I was like I'm tired of not
[25:05] understanding what they're saying about
[25:07] Bitcoin mining I'm tired of not
[25:10] understanding about Bitcoin and period
[25:12] let me research it and again that's when
[25:14] I found Bitcoin standard and other
[25:16] resources and in the white paper
[25:18] obviously and then I started to read and
[25:21] I started to understand and then I
[25:23] started to understand it as an asset
[25:24] class um the scarcity and how it's like
[25:29] the perfect money um and I started to
[25:32] really research it before I put any
[25:34] money into it to begin with I I really
[25:38] tried to know it as best as I could and
[25:40] then from there I started small and then
[25:42] I and then I started increasing more and
[25:44] then obviously I looked like a genius
[25:46] early on and then it dropped
[25:49] significantly like about two years ago
[25:51] so like to about 16,000 15,000 and
[25:55] everyone thought I was crazy and that I
[25:57] made a big mistake and it was going zero
[25:59] but I but the thing was I believed in it
[26:01] because I I felt I had a good
[26:03] understanding of it and and so that's
[26:05] what I usually tell people to begin with
[26:08] is try understand it first if you want
[26:11] to put some small amounts into it great
[26:14] but understand what you're doing first
[26:16] and then when you see these dips and
[26:18] prices or you see this volatility it
[26:20] almost means nothing to you because you
[26:22] know in the long run what we're looking
[26:25] at um and and so that's what I try to do
[26:28] with the people I know um I don't try to
[26:32] I think initially I tried to orange pill
[26:34] people but then I got away from that and
[26:37] just started telling people to study it
[26:41] gain some interest in it and at least
[26:43] know something about what you hear about
[26:45] on the news that you understand what
[26:48] this is because it's coming and it's for
[26:50] me almost impossible to Orange build
[26:52] people it's like they have to have some
[26:54] interest in it they have to have some
[26:56] pain or some something that they're like
[26:59] oh yeah I want to learn about Bitcoin uh
[27:01] and everyone will have this uh the the
[27:05] time when they're like oh yeah now I
[27:07] need to know about Bitcoin I really have
[27:09] to study Bitcoin now and this will come
[27:12] for different people at different times
[27:14] like uh we we
[27:17] we we have now uh in America and it's
[27:21] it's funny to see in Europe because in
[27:23] Europe there is no there's no no
[27:26] politician uh that is really popular and
[27:28] doing Bitcoin stuff but in America we
[27:31] now have Trump that really is
[27:35] um I want to be careful here because uh
[27:38] he he's not really a bitcoiner he just
[27:40] saw Bitcoin as an opportunity to get
[27:42] more wats I think I don't know how how
[27:45] really Bitcoin he is and how actually he
[27:48] understands it he understands the power
[27:50] of it and he understands the power of
[27:51] the
[27:52] community that's for sure but I have no
[27:55] clue if he actually understands Bitcoin
[27:58] uh to what extent like maybe he's really
[28:00] good on it maybe not I I have no clue uh
[28:04] but the the thing that's uh for sure he
[28:07] understands that he has to be Pro
[28:09] Bitcoin and that's a major thing like
[28:12] when uh the maybe future president of
[28:15] America the one of the candidates is is
[28:19] feeling uh almost obligated to speak
[28:22] positively about Bitcoin because he's uh
[28:25] depending on the voters this means the
[28:27] bit coiners are now a big group we're
[28:32] not a a small group anymore we're not
[28:34] like a niche thing because if we like
[28:36] just like one two% of the population or
[28:39] something like really or maybe even
[28:41] smaller than that he would not care for
[28:43] that we we we we are having a big thing
[28:47] and there's one thing that uh someone
[28:49] brought up in the podcast once um when
[28:52] you have 4% of Bitcoin who are
[28:56] intolerant of
[28:58] not of of using Bitcoin they they want
[29:01] to use Bitcoin as a payment method as a
[29:03] store of value then you kind of force it
[29:06] on the society because if one when 4%
[29:09] are intolerant about it this kind of
[29:11] forces everyone to kind of accept it
[29:14] like the stores to accept it the locals
[29:16] to accept it uh the politicians to talk
[29:19] positively about it like all all those
[29:21] things are slowly coming in America
[29:23] unfortunately I don't see that in Europe
[29:25] I'm a little bit Envy of Americans these
[29:27] days
[29:28] well well I think it's interesting and
[29:30] you brought up a great point was uh
[29:33] whether he know has a knowledge of it or
[29:35] not whether whether he has it bid has it
[29:38] or even a potential Third Party
[29:39] candidate of um which I think Robert F
[29:42] Kennedy has a junior has a as a at least
[29:45] a basic understanding and I know he he
[29:47] made it public he owns um several
[29:50] Bitcoin and his intent passes on his
[29:52] family stuff but it what I find
[29:56] interesting and you know just just my
[29:58] own personal opinion
[30:00] right the the way politics are
[30:02] especially for us in a two-party system
[30:04] for the for the most part you will have
[30:06] people who are going to vote for one
[30:09] side regardless and you're goingon to
[30:11] have another side that votes for the
[30:12] other side regardless just because of
[30:14] their affiliation for the party so
[30:16] there's that middle
[30:18] group who is you know we call them
[30:21] undecided or
[30:24] independent and how do you gain that
[30:28] small percentage so if if somebody's
[30:30] going to say we're going to be very Pro
[30:33] Bitcoin if there's a 10% does 6% go to
[30:37] this person and four go to this and that
[30:38] 2% difference results in winning an
[30:42] election
[30:44] then that's that's very
[30:46] enticing um for someone as they see that
[30:49] this is something that's important and I
[30:51] would say you look at the success in El
[30:53] Salvador and how much I I don't know if
[30:58] I I would say I definitely didn't pay
[31:01] attention when um president Buel first
[31:04] took office but it was all over the news
[31:07] this time and you had several us
[31:10] politicians at the inauguration so I
[31:13] think what he's been doing kind of
[31:15] caught the attention globally and then
[31:17] also with the Bitcoin ETFs um in our
[31:20] stock market with all of our you know
[31:23] Black Rock and Vanguard and everything
[31:24] else people who probably never would
[31:26] have invested in Bitcoin because of the
[31:29] wallets and transa you know all that
[31:31] stuff now they can go through the broker
[31:33] or do it themselves and there's a lot of
[31:36] money that's been poured into these ETFs
[31:38] so now you have the attention of a lot
[31:41] you know I would say people who have
[31:42] never been involved in any kind of
[31:44] Bitcoin purchases in the past and
[31:46] holding their coins now when you have
[31:48] big money like Black Rock and and um Arc
[31:52] and all the others who invested in this
[31:53] with ETFs um I think that's a that's a
[31:57] big that's a big thing especially if you
[31:58] invested all that money in thank you you
[32:00] already made it halfway through the
[32:01] video and I'm really really grateful to
[32:04] have you here two things make this
[32:06] channel possible you as a watcher and
[32:08] listener who keep supporting this
[32:10] Channel and another one is all the
[32:12] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[32:14] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[32:17] very start and where I personally buy my
[32:19] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[32:21] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[32:23] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[32:26] simplest and securest way to secure your
[32:30] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[32:32] only 2% of bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin
[32:35] in a hardware wallet how crazy is that
[32:37] don't be in that 98% bracket be in the
[32:40] 2% bracket and if you have self- custody
[32:43] and you know your friend does not have
[32:45] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[32:46] he needs a birthday present and a small
[32:49] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[32:51] 5% off your order plus you support my
[32:54] channel and now let's get back to the
[32:56] video there are people now that are I
[33:00] don't know 80 years old 70 years old who
[33:03] are in retirement who have 1 million 20
[33:06] million maybe 200 million uh net worth
[33:10] they are clients of uh black rock or
[33:13] other big investment firms uh and uh
[33:18] their advisor calls them I don't know
[33:20] once a quarter and says like hey hey
[33:22] Bill we have this this new Bitcoin thing
[33:25] uh it's it's really exciting it's that
[33:27] and it could be the new money it's
[33:29] really Innovative blah blah blah and
[33:32] he's like okay okay I trust you you have
[33:35] been with me so many years okay let's
[33:37] put 2% in there right and then all of
[33:39] the sudden because of the one phone call
[33:42] two million more in Bitcoin and that
[33:44] happens every day and uh and they have a
[33:48] a really a big big
[33:51] incentive um to grab the the fees to
[33:54] grab uh the the biggest market share of
[33:57] of Bitcoin so they are calling their
[33:59] clients he like invest like 1% invest
[34:02] like 5% that 5% will go over time and
[34:05] like hey maybe 10% should be in your
[34:08] portfolio and then maybe that that 80 or
[34:11] 70 year old guy was like oh maybe I
[34:14] should little bit research about it they
[34:16] going on Black Rock they see some things
[34:17] and they're like oh that's not enough I
[34:19] want to see like a podcast like there
[34:21] are people that like oh and then I was
[34:23] like then they call like oh it's really
[34:25] good can you invest like not 2% can you
[34:28] invest 20% 30% maybe 60% so like it
[34:34] makes sense over what time it it it it
[34:37] is it is a small process to the full
[34:41] adoption and you have all the big
[34:43] players in there and that's why it's
[34:44] really important to have the ETF uh I
[34:47] mean it kind of was innovat because when
[34:50] you have such a great asset of course
[34:52] the big investment firms will also want
[34:54] the share of the cake yeah sure uh but
[34:57] but this is what's happening like the
[34:59] big guys are coming now in and the the
[35:01] big money inflows we did not see till
[35:04] now like they already were big like the
[35:06] inflows were good but they also were
[35:08] offset with the gbcs and stuff like that
[35:10] but the really big thing uh still coming
[35:12] like this needs like even micro strategy
[35:15] needed like six months to to Really
[35:18] adopt it uh imagine uh a company run not
[35:23] by a Michael sailor who studies it and
[35:26] and then goes on and and like pushes in
[35:28] the company how long does it take like
[35:31] two years one year three years it can
[35:33] take a while uh and even for family
[35:36] offices this like oh then the family has
[35:38] to discuss then there's the advisors
[35:40] then there's all the things then they
[35:41] have to do the legal things like the ETF
[35:44] makes a lot of things easier but it's
[35:47] not like it it takes time like lure your
[35:50] time preference and and yeah be be in it
[35:53] make make sure you benefit from Bitcoin
[35:56] yeah which can be hard for a company
[35:57] right because especially if you if you
[36:00] if you're a registered company and you
[36:02] have stockholders and board members and
[36:05] you know you saw what happen with micro
[36:08] strategy right I mean at at one point
[36:11] when it was like at
[36:12] $116,000 you know everyone was kind of
[36:14] like oh he made the biggest mistake ever
[36:16] now Michael say looks like an absolute
[36:18] genius right and when you have someone
[36:21] like him I think also as a when you see
[36:24] the success of micro strategy because of
[36:26] this because of his strategy the Bitcoin
[36:29] strategy I I think that's attractive
[36:31] right as other Business Leaders look and
[36:33] say hey what's what is he doing how can
[36:36] we emulate that and apply that to our
[36:39] own business and where does this take us
[36:41] and so I I think someone like him is so
[36:43] important for the space because he's
[36:45] he's putting his money where his mouth
[36:47] is right I mean he's he's the one who's
[36:50] taking who's taken the biggest leap so
[36:54] far and he's been successful um so yeah
[36:59] I I think having him is just it's so
[37:01] great for for for the for the industry
[37:04] for the community on bitcoin overall
[37:08] definitely um one more thing that just
[37:10] came up in my mind nothing related to
[37:12] that but I just really released a
[37:15] podcast about that topic with someone
[37:17] and it's it's on my mind now it's how
[37:20] Bitcoin could actually stop wasteful
[37:24] thinking when you think the long term
[37:26] and Bitcoin is and money is worth
[37:29] something and whenever you buy something
[37:32] you know that you just spend money and
[37:37] if you did not spend the money the money
[37:38] would be worth more in one month in two
[37:40] months in in one year yes this
[37:43] completely eliminates wasteful Behavior
[37:47] M and I heard a czy statistics I did not
[37:51] prove it till now I have to I have to
[37:53] look it up closer so maybe I'm wrong
[37:55] with that statistic but
[37:57] I heard the statistic that 85% of all
[38:00] trash comes from the fashion industry
[38:03] from clothing and all that all that
[38:05] things and I was like that's that seems
[38:09] ridiculously high uh like even 40% would
[38:12] be really high for me but I know there
[38:15] are a lot of waste things and then uh I
[38:18] researched a little bit and it's like
[38:21] one out of five clothing uh
[38:24] items are going into trash before before
[38:27] even they have been worn once wow
[38:30] because they have been ordered nobody
[38:32] wants them they're out of the
[38:34] collection then they are thrown away and
[38:37] it's like is that possible in a Bitcoin
[38:40] world is is is that a thing still when
[38:42] money is actually hard and we Cann throw
[38:44] it around as easily yeah I'm actually
[38:47] very interested in that right because
[38:49] obviously we all know about the 10,000
[38:51] 10,000 Bitcoins for the pizza right
[38:53] that's the famous story um and so that's
[38:57] that goes down in history but yeah I
[39:00] mean I think about that all the time and
[39:02] you know Jack MERS he was I listened to
[39:05] his podcast and he talked about how he's
[39:08] all in on bitcoin so all everything he
[39:10] has he says he's is Bitcoin and so
[39:13] everything he uses is Bitcoin and so
[39:15] what he said
[39:16] was and much like you said right like it
[39:19] the transacting in
[39:21] Bitcoin is a tax right or in his case if
[39:25] he if he has to so he'll use a credit
[39:27] card and then he'll trans transition
[39:30] that Bitcoin to Fiat to pay off his
[39:32] credit card bill right and he said it
[39:35] makes him think you know do I go to this
[39:38] fabulous steak dinner that's $300 a
[39:42] plate and or I could just go and go to
[39:47] the store and grab a $10 steak and make
[39:49] it myself because I'm still eating steak
[39:52] but that $300 worth of or $300 worth of
[39:56] bitcoin that I spend on the Ste instead
[39:58] maybe I spend $10 worth of bitcoin in
[40:00] the stake so it makes you think about
[40:01] your decisions and are you are you
[40:03] really putting that money there and the
[40:05] same with clothing right like a lot of
[40:08] the material might be cheap fabric you
[40:10] know if if companies went to more
[40:13] durable fabric durable materials and
[40:16] things that could last longer um you
[40:19] know instead of buying new clothes even
[40:22] though you don't really change anything
[40:24] but they don't fade as much or they
[40:25] don't tear as easily you know do you
[40:29] build homes with more sturdy material
[40:33] because instead of hey it doesn't matter
[40:36] because in three years we're going to
[40:36] have to replace all of the outsid of the
[40:39] home we got to replace the brick what if
[40:41] we build it more sturdy better materials
[40:44] and put a lot more effort into that and
[40:46] I I would even say government
[40:48] spending do we do we focus our programs
[40:52] on things that are getting results and
[40:55] if they're not getting results do we
[40:57] continue funding them or do we identify
[41:00] why those results aren't being achieved
[41:03] and get people into those jobs who are
[41:05] going to achieve the desired results so
[41:07] if I'm trying to solve something like
[41:09] and I think recently it came up um that
[41:11] there's like a I think it was $6 billion
[41:15] dollar was put into um Road railroad
[41:18] tracks in California that only went like
[41:20] 600 met well where is that $6 billion
[41:24] that it only went 600 meters like what
[41:26] happened you know know where where are
[41:28] we finding fault um is it the companies
[41:31] employers is it the material is it the
[41:34] bureaucracy to get anything achieved you
[41:37] know if something takes 10 years to get
[41:39] approved do we really need to put all
[41:42] the money into having this bureaucracy
[41:44] to make sure you know what I mean
[41:45] there's so many different things and
[41:47] waste wasteful spending wasting time
[41:50] that I think using
[41:51] Bitcoin um would really achieve because
[41:55] like you're you're you're and when you
[41:57] said it about the fabric and and and
[41:59] clothing and everything else so you know
[42:02] we have are you familiar with Amazon um
[42:05] like the it's like an internet you can
[42:07] order clothing shoes you can order all
[42:09] this other stuff it's really big in the
[42:11] United States um and but there's a place
[42:15] where if it's a big Warehouse well
[42:18] they'll sell those items that people
[42:20] just
[42:21] returned never wearing once and you can
[42:24] Rey them at a repurchase them at a
[42:26] smaller at a discount if people don't
[42:28] buy them we're talking I'm talking one
[42:30] little area we have in our NE on our
[42:31] area that has a giant Warehouse full of
[42:35] clothing and shoes and everything else
[42:37] that were just tossed
[42:39] aside put that across the whole world
[42:42] and so when you said that 85% of the
[42:44] trash is is is coming from that I I
[42:47] totally believe it and if if you knew
[42:50] that that I'm spending this money on
[42:54] this item and I may never wear it I'm
[42:56] going to throw it away I'm not throwing
[42:58] away you know what's $30 in Bitcoin now
[43:00] what's $30 in Bitcoin going to be 10
[43:02] years from now so you brought up a great
[43:05] point and May so there is a warehouse
[43:10] where all the items that never have been
[43:12] touched but they have been uh returned
[43:16] uh from Amazon and you can buy them
[43:19] there for like cheaper yeah I think it's
[43:21] called Zappos is um where the Zappos and
[43:24] others where it's like returning shoes
[43:27] so if you order shoes let's say they
[43:28] don't fit cuz you ordered them online
[43:30] they don't fit you return them and then
[43:33] they'll be resold elsewhere and so as a
[43:37] one example if that's if that's just a
[43:40] giant Warehouse in the area I live I can
[43:43] imagine if you just put that across the
[43:45] world that's not even counting the items
[43:46] that are thrown away um the items that
[43:49] are just laying around like we have
[43:51] we've had three daughters and so we have
[43:53] a lot of
[43:55] uh girls clothes that we've collected
[43:58] over the years right just because we've
[43:59] been passing them down from Kid to Kid
[44:01] to Kid and so now we're going to pass
[44:03] those on um to someone else to use them
[44:06] that way they don't just end up in a
[44:07] dump somewhere um that's just us so I
[44:11] can imagine if it's worldwide I don't
[44:13] doubt that number 85% of the waste is
[44:15] coming from the fashion industry it's
[44:17] it's fascinating I I have to look it up
[44:19] if there's something like that in
[44:21] Austria or in the European Union
[44:22] probably there is some somewhere the
[44:24] place because uh there's so much sending
[44:27] back from Amazon going on even even for
[44:30] me like I I I have a room where there's
[44:33] like a
[44:34] window and uh it's like connected to the
[44:39] stairways uh and whenever someone is in
[44:41] stairways the lights are on and there's
[44:43] a bed in there uh and and it's like when
[44:46] you're lying in bed and in the middle of
[44:47] the night someone goes on the stairways
[44:49] all of the sudden your room is lit
[44:52] up it's a it's a really funny con
[44:55] construction but I just just like
[44:57] ordered like black things that I can put
[44:59] on the on the V because there's no few I
[45:02] just like want to have the the the
[45:05] darkness in there and the funny thing is
[45:07] it did not fit nicely so I had to send
[45:09] it back and it it's so easy like you're
[45:12] just like AIT and oh [ __ ] it does not
[45:16] it's send it back like there you don't
[45:17] even need a printer you don't need
[45:20] packaging thing because you just go to
[45:22] like 500 meter to like something give it
[45:24] and they do everything for you uh you
[45:27] get your full money back you don't pay
[45:29] anything and if it's so easy to give
[45:31] things back um you don't even really
[45:34] think of when you when you buy it like
[45:36] you're like ah it's Amazon I just buy it
[45:39] if it does not fit if it does not as
[45:41] good I just send it back it's it's it's
[45:44] it's kind of this this this fear
[45:45] mentality yeah let's let's just do it
[45:47] and then like if if it if it's not okay
[45:50] we just throw it away and it's it's
[45:52] interesting for me to think about that
[45:55] no yeah no it it's it is amazing and
[45:58] again I I really credit the Fiat
[46:00] standard for opening my eyes to a lot of
[46:03] that especially with the materials and
[46:06] um you know you look at early
[46:08] Construction in the US a lot of the
[46:10] buildings that were cre that built in
[46:12] the 40s and 50s are still standing but
[46:14] the ones that are being built now fall
[46:16] apart so quickly it it's it's so
[46:19] wasteful and that's just you know I
[46:22] can't even that's just United States I
[46:24] mean the history in Europe right I mean
[46:27] that's I can't even begin to imagine the
[46:31] some of the construction and
[46:33] architecture and everything else that's
[46:35] been there for hundreds of years
[46:37] thousands of years in some cases um so I
[46:41] just it it's something that reading that
[46:43] book and if anyone hasn't read it I
[46:46] definitely recommend it um it I would I
[46:48] would say it's a life-changing book
[46:50] because it really changes your
[46:51] perspective on a lot of things it's
[46:53] funny to see in in Vienna it's it's
[46:56] really they're really beautiful and old
[46:59] buildings that are there for hundreds of
[47:01] thousands of years uh and then there are
[47:04] these new class and stone bricks that
[47:08] are really ugly but they're new and
[47:10] modern and I'm like I don't know I I
[47:13] like
[47:14] it it kind of looks really really really
[47:17] bad and I I prefer like this old things
[47:21] even I'm here like I there's like a
[47:23] wooden thing it it Crees and cratches
[47:25] and it's like when I open the doors
[47:27] like and but I love it it's old it's
[47:30] it's there for a long time and it's just
[47:32] have been a little bit renovated and
[47:34] there like all those small details on on
[47:36] the doors there's this High ceilings it
[47:40] it's really uh it gives you a good
[47:43] feeling about it I love it a lot another
[47:46] topic that I wanted to discuss with you
[47:47] is um because we're talking about fear
[47:50] and and how how those things are uh
[47:53] about zombie companies you're aware that
[47:55] like I feel like
[47:57] a lot of the companies that are now even
[47:59] in the S&P 500 and other great companies
[48:03] and big companies they would not be
[48:05] around on the Bitcoin standard I think
[48:06] we would uh get rid of a lot of
[48:09] Waterhead companies a lot of Waterhead
[48:12] government that's for sure but also
[48:14] companies that are actually right now um
[48:17] so close to government that they're like
[48:19] getting feeded by the tax money even
[48:21] though they are not really uh government
[48:24] uh companies but then they also like big
[48:26] comp companies because they have been
[48:28] there for so long and money was cheap so
[48:30] they they kind of live on that so
[48:32] there's a lot of um I could I call it
[48:35] Waterhead companies like they have a big
[48:38] water Waterhead management team company
[48:42] thing above that and they're really
[48:44] inefficient in in the way they they're
[48:46] doing things but they're there because
[48:48] money is cheap and they can get cheap
[48:50] credits and everything um do you also
[48:53] think that the economy will actually
[48:56] shrink to its necessity and this this
[48:59] might make us way better for the future
[49:02] and we just have to be in a de growth
[49:05] phase maybe for a little while yeah
[49:08] that's a that's a really tough one
[49:10] because I've always felt that the people
[49:13] who are making money
[49:17] right the right way or not right like
[49:19] you said some of those companies you
[49:21] described the pressure on them to
[49:24] continue making money
[49:27] is very great so whatever loopholes in
[49:31] any kind of laws that they can find or
[49:33] any ways that they can continue to make
[49:36] themselves wealthy and
[49:38] shareholders uh wealthy I think there
[49:41] there's enough legal loopholes
[49:45] to really fix things right now if that
[49:48] makes sense um I think it's going to be
[49:50] really hard I really do and like one for
[49:53] as an example right um we talk about
[49:56] here United States they talked about
[49:58] increasing minimum wage to so that's
[50:01] great the problem
[50:04] is I think it only works if the the
[50:07] company or the organization is willing
[50:09] to not make as much
[50:11] profit and so if you're not and you
[50:14] raise minimum wage then you either are
[50:17] going to lay people off and fire them or
[50:20] you're going to drastically increase the
[50:22] prices so if you if you fire the people
[50:27] then the product suffers because you
[50:30] have less people doing more work if you
[50:34] increase the prices but keep the people
[50:36] you have less customers because they're
[50:38] not willing to pay that much
[50:41] money assuming the businesses maintain
[50:43] the same profit margins and so I I think
[50:47] that is I think that's probably our
[50:49] biggest challenge right now because
[50:50] we're trying to and again the majority
[50:52] of people are just trying to live their
[50:53] lives earn money and raise their
[50:55] families and and I I feel like some of
[50:58] these government programs that that they
[51:00] try to do to try to keep either people
[51:02] or businesses afloat I think have some
[51:05] negative impacts um so if they're hire
[51:08] if they're maybe they're firing people
[51:09] so you increased the wages but now
[51:11] you're not hiring as many people or you
[51:13] you've increased the wages but now the
[51:16] prices of foods going up and so you're
[51:19] not getting as many customers which and
[51:21] then turns to I'm going to have to fire
[51:23] people because I'm not getting as much
[51:24] customers I mean so unless a I think
[51:26] unless a company's willing to um accept
[51:30] smaller profit
[51:31] margins I I don't necessarily think it's
[51:34] going to change too quickly um I think I
[51:37] would see more people more businesses
[51:39] going under than getting better this is
[51:41] a really great Point here because here
[51:44] we see an example of government
[51:47] intervening in the free market and that
[51:49] what you just just described is very
[51:51] correct and there's another aspect to it
[51:54] that is been overlooking at sometimes
[51:57] because when you increase minimum
[52:00] wage honestly Amazon does not have a
[52:03] problem with that Apple doesn't have a
[52:05] problem with that uh all the really big
[52:07] and profitable companies they don't have
[52:09] a problem like increasing the the few
[52:12] people that are they are employing on a
[52:14] minimum wage because all the software
[52:17] developers they have big management they
[52:20] have the big they are not they are not
[52:23] on minimum wage anyways and a few people
[52:26] who have minimum wage they are smaller
[52:28] part of their budget okay then they have
[52:31] maybe
[52:32] 0.2% less profits uh they increase price
[52:36] somewhere else they don't even notice it
[52:39] but the thing that happens uh this
[52:42] really um makes the startups and the
[52:45] small businesses and the small and
[52:48] business uh small and medium size
[52:50] business suffer a lot that's what's
[52:53] happening when you increase the barrier
[52:55] to high someone y this does not affect
[53:00] Amazon Apple this affects the small
[53:03] local business the small restaurant that
[53:07] is then being replaced by a restaurant
[53:10] chain who has the bigger budget and
[53:13] that's a really bad thing to have like
[53:15] that's that like whenever the government
[53:18] tries
[53:19] to get into the free market to do
[53:22] something for the small people and mess
[53:24] it up for the small people and good for
[53:26] the big people it's it's always the same
[53:29] thing they try to do it the same with
[53:31] the income tax this was the the same why
[53:34] they they they had the income tax uh
[53:37] they're doing the same way with like
[53:39] printing money helicopter money they're
[53:42] giving it to the poor people but the
[53:44] poor people spend it on
[53:46] Amazon they there was just saying in
[53:49] 2020 um they printed so much money that
[53:52] Jeff Bezos got
[53:54] retired he got so much money that that
[53:57] Jeff Bas said like okay I have so much
[53:59] money I have to do something with my
[54:02] life now I cannot be the CEO of Amazon
[54:04] anymore H and that's that's uh it's it's
[54:07] just ridiculous to see and uh it's I
[54:10] hope that we have a Bitcoin standard and
[54:12] get some in some sanity back in in in
[54:15] the system yeah no it's like we you know
[54:19] you describ like the
[54:20] corporatization of the world where the
[54:23] the you know for us like the Walmart the
[54:25] Apple the Amazon the giant companies so
[54:30] all your local businesses all your local
[54:32] economy has gone and now everyone's
[54:35] shopping at these super centers that are
[54:38] these gigantic Nationwide corporations
[54:40] or worldwide corporations and so like
[54:42] you said like you you're try they pass
[54:46] policies that are intended maybe to help
[54:50] people and in the end end up hurting the
[54:53] the the middle class and and lower class
[54:55] and it's hard it's hard to watch um it
[54:58] really is
[54:59] I you see it happening and you know I'm
[55:04] I financially I'm
[55:06] fine but when I go to a a store even
[55:11] though I have nothing to worry about I
[55:13] come from lower middle class and I I
[55:17] understand the impact of people who
[55:19] don't have money to spend on food and so
[55:22] you
[55:23] know if if I'm looking at these prices
[55:26] like this is ridiculous I'm paying this
[55:27] much for bread and eggs and milk and I'm
[55:30] okay like I feel for the families who
[55:33] are barely getting by and then on top of
[55:37] that what kind of Lifestyle what kind of
[55:41] Health do those people have because you
[55:44] know especially with obesity and I don't
[55:46] know how it is in in Europe but you know
[55:50] obesi to me looks like a problem here in
[55:52] the United States I I could be wrong but
[55:54] it looks like a problem and it's easy to
[55:56] say oh a problem yeah you you need to
[56:00] eat better you need to eat healthier and
[56:01] be more active but I will tell you
[56:04] sometime for the lower middle class
[56:06] people like the unhealthy food is really
[56:09] all they can afford and so I don't I
[56:13] don't like you said I I I don't like
[56:16] seeing it it makes makes me sad to see
[56:18] that um I would like to see a more
[56:20] healthier population of people who can
[56:22] afford the food who can afford things um
[56:24] and get back to maybe a small
[56:26] smaller um local kind of standard of of
[56:29] doing
[56:31] business this is uh it's it's very true
[56:33] yeah obesity is definitely a
[56:36] problem I think I think more in America
[56:39] than than in Europe but as always
[56:42] Europeans uh adopting the American
[56:44] Trends so we are also adopting the
[56:46] Obesity
[56:47] definitely so you'll catch up soon we
[56:50] will catch up soon uh the the the
[56:53] Americans adopted the internet uh faster
[56:56] than us and they adopted obesity faster
[56:58] than us but we catch we're catching up
[57:00] we're catching up they're also in front
[57:02] with the Bitcoin
[57:04] so it it we will we will we will be
[57:07] there we will be more fat don't you
[57:09] worry okay counting on
[57:11] it I mean uh yeah it's like
[57:15] uh the richness in food is really cool
[57:18] in in Europe like they have Austrian
[57:21] food then you have the Italian food the
[57:23] French food like there's really a lot of
[57:25] culture in the food MH and I also see
[57:29] now when you go to those countries there
[57:31] are still those really local really
[57:33] local restaurants but this trend is
[57:35] already starting this this oh there's
[57:38] McDonald's Burger King I I talked with
[57:40] an American in the Bitcoin bra
[57:42] conference uh and he he was it's so so
[57:45] funny yeah like you you travel around
[57:47] the world like you you fly eight nine 10
[57:50] hours across the ocean just to go to
[57:54] McDonald's the same one that you having
[57:56] a Marica
[57:58] call that's true well you know it's
[58:00] funny um a couple years ago I was in
[58:02] Germany near uh Vis Boden area and I ate
[58:06] in a local community and that was a
[58:08] different experience I mean it was it
[58:10] was more natural food um it was not you
[58:15] know I didn't eat at any chain American
[58:17] restaurants or anything like that so
[58:18] that was it was it was great and then my
[58:21] mother-in-law um so she's from Mexico
[58:25] originally uh lives in California but
[58:27] now she she's been with us for the last
[58:29] couple years and she makes more
[58:31] traditional Mexican food so a lot of
[58:35] like
[58:36] vegetables um a lot of like lean meat
[58:39] and chickens and stuff like that and so
[58:42] that's primarily been our our family's
[58:44] diet has been more natural foods not
[58:48] processed and you know it's at the point
[58:51] now where if when you go to a fast food
[58:54] restaurant or you eat you you know we
[58:56] call fried food or junk
[58:58] food you don't feel very well you know
[59:01] it's eating that natural food it's just
[59:03] your body feels so much better and um
[59:06] and so I I have to I owe her all credit
[59:08] because uh she she does all the shopping
[59:10] and gets the food for us and cooks for
[59:12] us and really amazing but you know had I
[59:16] been eating a junk food diet or anything
[59:18] else I I could imagine what kind of life
[59:20] I would have I mean it's just the health
[59:22] just dropped significantly based off of
[59:24] the food you eat and it's so easy to go
[59:26] to some take out shop and like I work a
[59:31] lot then I work out also a lot uh
[59:34] there's not a lot of time left in my day
[59:36] to cook but I cook every day because I
[59:39] know there's one thing in my life I
[59:41] cannot get back it's my health like when
[59:44] I screw up my health that's it like
[59:46] that's over I like I I know that there
[59:51] could be a point where I get some
[59:53] disease uh and it's just like I just had
[59:57] bad luck there there's this thing
[59:59] there's all thing you can't go in front
[60:01] of the door and bus runs over you bad
[60:03] luck right but there is a lot of things
[60:06] that you can control in your health and
[60:08] you should control it and you should eat
[60:10] good not that you get like to 200 years
[60:13] old but that your life gets better right
[60:16] now yes and when I eat good food if I
[60:19] work out if I get enough sleep the day
[60:22] the next day is better it's not like oh
[60:24] yeah I do that uh so I can have a nice
[60:27] retirement when I'm 80 years old and I
[60:29] I'm still active I will be still active
[60:32] because I'm healthier uh but I'm doing
[60:34] that for even now and for tomorrow and
[60:37] for in in 80 years but that's the that's
[60:40] the thing that uh people don't get about
[60:42] health it's right now better if if you
[60:45] only eat uh McDonald's if you only eat
[60:48] uh junk food you life sucks from this
[60:52] day onwards because it's not doing good
[60:54] for your body yeah well that goes back
[60:57] to you know the Bitcoin and the the time
[60:59] preference right instead of that
[61:01] immediate satisfaction of that that junk
[61:03] food that might taste great you know the
[61:06] next day you're going to feel terrible
[61:07] and what's that going to do to you down
[61:09] the road and I've worked so hard on my
[61:11] fitness and my health do I want to throw
[61:13] it away by doing this or been just
[61:16] drinking alcohol all day and all night
[61:18] and partying all day and all night and
[61:21] and you know that it just goes back to I
[61:23] think at least the people I follow on on
[61:26] like X and other channels the
[61:29] bitcoiners for the most part are
[61:32] generally healthy or promote a healthy
[61:36] lifestyle and I think that is I think
[61:38] it's pretty cool to be part of a
[61:40] community like that you just have to go
[61:43] to bitcoin prag or to bitcoin Nashville
[61:46] uh when you when you're there uh and you
[61:49] see an amazing group of people they are
[61:52] healthy they're working out of course
[61:54] they're also uh uh people that are a
[61:57] little overweight there not everyone in
[62:01] the Bitcoin Community corre is is is fit
[62:04] and perfect and everything uh it doesn't
[62:07] have to be like that but the overall
[62:09] consensus is that if you understand
[62:12] Bitcoin from a first principles
[62:14] perspectives you understand that the
[62:17] only thing more valuable in in in your
[62:20] life than Bitcoin is your time and in
[62:23] time I because I made a post and and
[62:25] people no there's family friends and
[62:27] love and everything I consider that time
[62:29] like time with your family time with
[62:31] your friends time with with your love
[62:34] time for yourself like this is the only
[62:37] thing that's more valuable than Bitcoin
[62:39] and when you get the value proposition
[62:41] of Bitcoin you're more likely to get the
[62:44] out of things and you value your time
[62:45] more and then yeah it's it's uh we we
[62:48] talked about it long now I think we we
[62:50] have at home the point yeah and it's and
[62:53] it's really important to to to to take
[62:56] care of yourself I feel like and we
[62:59] already I was surprised like we already
[63:01] at the over one hour Mark um I would uh
[63:04] just uh go into Andro now uh if if you
[63:07] don't want to add anything but you can
[63:09] add it afterwards um in the tin is for
[63:13] the the first question of the tin is for
[63:15] every guest the same question and it is
[63:18] what are you currently passionate about
[63:20] besides
[63:21] Bitcoin so as so I'm retiring um from
[63:26] the military here shortly so I've really
[63:28] put a lot of my passion into and it's
[63:31] been there before but my real passion is
[63:33] my family um I've been spending as much
[63:36] time with my children as possible um
[63:39] there's a lot of time that I missed out
[63:41] due to deployment to Iraq and training
[63:44] missions in the Army and so there's a
[63:47] lot that I missed that I'll never get
[63:49] back and I realized that a couple years
[63:51] ago which is why I decided to retire was
[63:54] there are moments that I've missed with
[63:56] my first two daughters like their first
[63:58] words their first steps all those things
[64:01] and so I'm really trying to catch up for
[64:03] lost time um so being with them being
[64:06] with them through their Sports their
[64:07] activities and being as present as
[64:10] possible in their lives is is really my
[64:13] passion and also supporting my wife who
[64:15] has supported me all these years um
[64:17] she's a nurse practitioner and so
[64:20] supporting her as she continues her
[64:22] career um and and being as supportive
[64:25] for her as she was for me over these 20
[64:28] years almost I love it a lot and it's
[64:31] fascinating for me how much how many
[64:33] bitcoiners are bringing family at this
[64:35] point in in the conversation uh with
[64:38] with with the passion I love that a lot
[64:41] about the Bitcoin Community um before uh
[64:44] now we come to the actual end routine um
[64:46] and this is the end routine where the
[64:48] previous guest is asking a question for
[64:50] the next guest without knowing who the
[64:51] next guest actually is uh and it's an
[64:54] interesting one um what are you doing to
[64:57] relax and calm
[64:59] down um so I like to be active I like to
[65:04] exercise I like to be outside walk my
[65:07] dog um I like to jog take my kids and be
[65:11] outside with them they they're big
[65:12] soccer players um so they or football
[65:16] right uh so I like to get them as
[65:19] involved as possible they do a lot of uh
[65:22] traveling all over the country to play
[65:24] soccer and so just being outside with
[65:27] them being active and living as healthy
[65:29] of life as
[65:31] possible I love it very cool um before I
[65:34] let you go where can people uh find you
[65:37] where can people learn more about you
[65:39] and then ask you questions yeah so you

[65:59] military to civilian lifestyle um
[66:02] interview entrepreneurs and also
[66:05] bitcoiners um as we say no no [ __ ]
[66:07] coiners so if you're a big in the eth or
[66:10] anything of that no thank you but we are
[66:12] uh Bitcoin only and had quite a few
[66:14] Bitcoin guests on so far who've who uh
[66:17] are really helping introduce people to
[66:21] it my my focus isn't
[66:23] bitcoiners or Bitcoin
[66:26] passionate people specifically it's a
[66:30] group of people who have not really who
[66:33] don't know understand or are kind of
[66:35] interested in getting into Bitcoin so
[66:38] it's maybe a little different audience
[66:40] um than some um but it it is my way of
[66:42] trying to get more people to understand
[66:44] it amazing I love it thank you for for
