--------------------------------------------------

[00:00] is really necessary to have some tools
[00:02] that you can buy or sell Bitcoin peer
[00:05] to-peer how does it matter if the UNR is
[00:08] no KC the young people will start to use
[00:11] better money and they will not ask
[00:14] anybody to do so because for them it
[00:17] will be so straightforward to use
[00:20] Bitcoin what's the main hurdle for
[00:22] people not to do it non kyc people don't
[00:26] know the possible consequences that kyc
[00:28] Bitcoin uh can have
[00:31] it's so important that we embrace the
[00:33] peer-to-peer connections and the non KC
[00:36] route and the Privacy route also and I
[00:38] would just start off with that question
[00:40] like why is nonky peer-to-peer uh
[00:44] privacy focused uh so important to you
[00:47] and for
[00:48] vexel so uh I would maybe start that uh
[00:53] non kyc mindset is uh different mind
[00:57] mindset at all uh because um uh it
[01:00] encourages you to like prepare for the
[01:05] future prepare for something that uh can
[01:08] go wrong uh with our society or or with
[01:13] uh with like big players and all the
[01:16] stuff so non kyc uh for me personally is
[01:21] is important because you are within the
[01:25] community you have to know the or uh
[01:29] with wexel you have to know the uh
[01:32] counterparties the people that you buy
[01:35] or sell Bitcoin to and uh it's it's
[01:39] important nowadays because uh a lot of
[01:42] times there is uh more and more
[01:45] regulations coming in uh and for example
[01:49] uh last year you can you could buy in
[01:52] Slovakia that's neighbor State of Czech
[01:55] Republic uh from ATM like non kyc
[01:59] Bitcoin but right now uh they shut it
[02:02] down they uh enter a new leg legislation
[02:06] and now you cannot buy non kyc Bitcoin
[02:09] from ATM so it's like very different uh
[02:13] than than non kyc and I think that uh
[02:17] everybody should know the consequences
[02:21] of kyc uh and nonk kyc and for us it's
[02:26] important because uh there was like
[02:30] any uh company or any site uh like
[02:34] product app anything that
[02:38] uh was giving the users uh the chance to
[02:42] trade peer-to-peer and trade like with
[02:46] cash and uh we encourages people to go
[02:51] meet your Vex slags uh like it's it's uh
[02:57] vexel is uh like the name of vexel is uh
[03:02] from I don't know which state you are
[03:05] from but uh it's like from German or
[03:07] something like that and it was like in
[03:11] uh before the before the uh or during
[03:16] the Communist there were like Vex slags
[03:19] and they were exchanging uh the the like
[03:23] uh foreign currencies so WX slags uh
[03:27] it's uh important to meet your slack and
[03:31] give him the cash and there would be
[03:34] like no uh no like stop uh because when
[03:41] you could uh trading uh like we are Bank
[03:45] bank transfer bank transfer it's like uh
[03:49] you're like giving the traces to to the
[03:53] bank and yeah so that's why that's why
[03:57] it's important for us to have the have
[04:00] the product to use cash and buy Bitcoin
[04:03] sell Bitcoin and yeah yeah it's amazing
[04:07] and you also like in this like you are
[04:09] the social media person from vexel so
[04:13] probably you get to know a lot of like
[04:16] feedback from the community all over the
[04:18] world uh which also leads me to my next
[04:21] question um I think non KC and KC
[04:26] different people have different mindsets
[04:28] in different countries
[04:30] uh I hear people saying oh if you're in
[04:33] the European Union don't worry about non
[04:35] KC I think you should definitely have
[04:37] non KC at least like I always have this
[04:40] approach have two stacks like build a
[04:43] non KC stack and build a KC stack like
[04:45] you have two two stacks the one that's
[04:48] probably a little bit bigger probably uh
[04:51] is more optimized for fees and stuff
[04:54] like that and the another one nobody
[04:56] knows about uh and I would encourage
[04:59] people to to play around with everything
[05:02] like I obviously because of my podcast I
[05:05] have to play around with all the
[05:06] exchanges all the tools that are on my
[05:08] podcast to have a little bit of of of
[05:11] knowledge about them uh and it's getting
[05:14] harder because I have every day a guest
[05:16] on so it's it's getting hard to keep up
[05:18] with all the stuff that bitcoiners are
[05:19] doing um but do you see um U difference
[05:24] in the
[05:25] countries uh which are using nonk versus
[05:30] KC do you see like uh maybe in Africa
[05:33] it's not as big of a deal with known KC
[05:36] or maybe like there are certain count
[05:38] like even maybe if if with the status of
[05:41] How High they are
[05:42] developed um do you see some difference
[05:45] in adoption of KC versus non KC and
[05:48] privacy
[05:49] tools uh I think It Gos down to like the
[05:54] Bitcoin Educators uh because in Czech
[05:57] Republic we are lucky to have like
[06:00] awesome people
[06:02] who like uh think around the corner or
[06:06] how would say uh that uh think uh to the
[06:10] Future and what can happen so they are
[06:14] encouraging people to uh study even the
[06:17] non kyc uh kind of thing and uh in
[06:22] Republic is like uh developed a lot uh
[06:26] because uh they know the consequences
[06:29] what can happen and but uh right now as
[06:33] we are scaling uh our app to different
[06:37] countries because uh we are Czech
[06:40] Republic and Slovak native and now we
[06:43] are scaling to the uh different
[06:45] countries so we are seeing yeah there is
[06:48] a big difference uh in perception of non
[06:52] kyc uh because for example in Denmark or
[06:57] Sweden Finland uh
[07:00] like when you are doing something with
[07:02] your cash uh you are uh or other people
[07:06] thinks that uh you are doing something
[07:09] illegal so for them uh to like start uh
[07:16] start uh using vexel or other other apps
[07:20] and uh trading peer-to-peer with their
[07:24] cash and not uh via bank transfer it's
[07:27] kind of hard because uh uh they are
[07:31] doing everything uh they are doing
[07:33] everything like with their uh credit
[07:35] card or so on so uh for example uh this
[07:40] is the uh biggest difference and for
[07:43] example in Italy uh there's uh people
[07:47] that uh really uh loves to do it
[07:50] peer-to-peer
[07:51] but uh on the other hand uh like the
[07:56] entry uh to uh kyc exchange is so so
[08:02] much uh easier sometimes that a lot of
[08:06] people rather do kyc than uh
[08:09] peer-to-peer and I would say uh in
[08:13] Africa it's uh developing a lot uh and
[08:17] peer-to-peer thing in Africa is a big
[08:19] deal and I can see uh some of their uh
[08:23] some of uh users or some of bitcoiners
[08:26] from uh Africa reaching out us and uh
[08:32] saying or telling uh to us yeah we need
[08:35] to Exel in Africa because uh it will
[08:38] change our lives a lot so we got uh
[08:41] somebody from na Namibia trying to uh
[08:45] trying to uh like spread the word about
[08:49] it and and all the stuff so yeah uh the
[08:52] difference is is uh is a big and I would
[08:58] say uh uh like peer-to-peer is is
[09:03] necessary for the people where uh they
[09:07] are like in the developing countries
[09:09] because uh they don't have a entry uh or
[09:13] the easy entry to uh kyc exchange and uh
[09:17] for that country is really necessary to
[09:20] have uh some tools that uh you can buy
[09:25] or sell Bitcoin uh like peer-to-peer May
[09:29] yeah it's like I think it's it's it's so
[09:32] important that we have this option like
[09:34] it's so important that we have
[09:37] peer-to-peer option and then there are a
[09:39] lot of people saying um how does it
[09:42] matter if the onr is not is no KC uh
[09:47] there are a lot of different aspects to
[09:48] it like even if if there's no Bad actors
[09:51] in the state there could be bad actors
[09:53] that hack the database and then uh they
[09:55] know oh he bought so many Bitcoins then
[09:57] they know where the honeybot is and
[09:59] stuff like that it's like there's a lot
[10:01] that goes into that um what's
[10:05] interesting also this the interaction
[10:08] because we have the European Union that
[10:11] has this whole thing with the UN hosted
[10:12] wallets and and tries to limit it then
[10:15] we have the uh United States that has
[10:18] it's way more open to bitcoin still
[10:21] there are a lot of big forces that talk
[10:23] against it uh in general uh and then we
[10:26] have swiss they they seem to be really
[10:29] uh um um good and and open to to bitcoin
[10:32] and trying to have the inovation in
[10:34] their country obviously then we have El
[10:36] Salvador where there's top down adoption
[10:39] we have Nigeria where there's bottom up
[10:42] really Grassroots adoption I think
[10:44] Nigeria is still the the country with
[10:46] the biggest adoption uh steps um what's
[10:50] what's interesting for me is how does uh
[10:52] the regular Tory Force how does
[10:54] governments how does the Czech Republic
[10:56] governments how does uh other
[10:58] governments of of uh uh the people look
[11:03] at nonk peer-to-peer
[11:05] transactions uh I know from Beach
[11:08] Bitcoin I think a swiss-based company
[11:10] that she was also on the podcast uh she
[11:13] said she's she does not want to go now
[11:16] to the United States uh because uh it's
[11:20] it's for her too dangerous she doesn't
[11:22] want to get on the bed side of the
[11:23] United States uh do you have some
[11:26] insights for us like uh how the regulat
[11:29] Force how the Europe Union how yeah the
[11:33] Czech Republic and other parts of the
[11:35] worlds look at P top uh and is there
[11:39] chance that it might get like taken down
[11:42] a p top exchange like first thing uh I
[11:46] would say
[11:48] that if you create
[11:51] uh like your uh Social Circle of WX SLS
[11:57] or people that you can buy or sell
[11:59] Bitcoin to uh before this uh you have
[12:05] like uh you are lucky or and you will be
[12:10] all set but for the people that uh would
[12:14] not have the chance to do it it will be
[12:17] tricky
[12:19] so even if uh there will be regulations
[12:23] that uh they would ban peer-to-peer
[12:26] transactions or uh all that stuff I
[12:29] think Bitcoin is UN Unstoppable and uh
[12:34] the people would be uh trading
[12:36] peer-to-peer like always uh and if you
[12:41] if there will be uh cash on our planet
[12:46] or on uh in our state uh always you can
[12:50] trade Bitcoin peer-to-peer
[12:52] and yeah they maybe like bun it and give
[12:55] you maybe some uh some uh fine or
[12:59] something like that but for people it
[13:01] will be uh this important that they will
[13:05] trade trade it and about the regulations
[13:09] uh as of now I think uh vexel operates
[13:14] in every state uh except of USA because
[13:18] yeah uh USA is kind of tricky uh with
[13:22] the uh legislation and all the stuff so
[13:26] we are pretty sure that it's not uh
[13:31] permitted in any country uh as of now
[13:35] like um like Europe country or uh some
[13:39] normal country know uh Northern Korea or
[13:44] and some of uh this type of countries
[13:49] and
[13:50] uh yeah I think uh maybe it will uh get
[13:56] banned gets banned uh in some of the
[13:59] autocratic countries uh but uh as of now
[14:04] uh like you can trade it uh whenever you
[14:09] are okay uh really really cool what's
[14:14] what do you see as when when you are on
[14:15] social media and when you talk with
[14:17] people a lot um what's the main hurdle
[14:20] for people not to do it non KY like why
[14:25] uh if they get Bitcoin if they get the
[14:27] mission of Bitcoin they're buying
[14:29] uh it's like what do you think is the
[14:31] main hurdle for people to switch to a
[14:34] non KC or at least have an additional
[14:37] non KC stack uh uh to their KC stack is
[14:41] it like the convenience factor is it
[14:43] what what do you think it is I think
[14:46] convenience uh a large part in it but I
[14:51] think it's uh the biggest part is I
[14:56] think like the knowledge about it and
[14:59] and uh the people don't know the
[15:02] possible consequences that uh kyc
[15:05] Bitcoin uh can have and um I think it's
[15:10] our job to educate people uh about it uh
[15:14] and we are always uh saying that yeah uh
[15:18] use the real Bitcoin uh the Bitcoin that
[15:21] cannot be confiscated cannot be uh
[15:25] like like uh you can do with Bitcoin uh
[15:30] whatever you want
[15:32] and uh we are always telling the people
[15:36] uh this type of things and uh the
[15:42] knowledge about it I think slowly
[15:45] uh is getting better because uh slowly
[15:50] uh there are uh there are like examples
[15:54] of kyc exchanges getting uh like gropped
[15:58] or hacked or or some something like that
[16:01] and uh all the time uh and even uh the
[16:07] fact that uh in some countries is uh
[16:11] it's hard harder and harder to uh login
[16:16] or registrate to to some kyc exchange
[16:20] because they need your uh passport and
[16:24] some uh something or list of your uh
[16:28] bank or something like that and for some
[16:31] people it's really hard to uh register
[16:34] to uh kic exchange so nowadays it's uh a
[16:39] lot easier to uh explain why uh non kyc
[16:45] mindset matter and it's
[16:48] important yeah it's it's so important I
[16:50] think the the threats are are there um
[16:53] maybe because of the knowledge but I
[16:55] think uh whenever there's a Bitcoin
[16:57] crowd there's a big part of the Bitcoin
[16:59] grow that's listening that never did a
[17:02] peer-to-peer transaction uh never bought
[17:04] Bitcoin peer-to-peer
[17:07] uh maybe let's let's take us through the
[17:10] app really quick like not with
[17:11] screenshots not with anything like just
[17:14] uh how is the process difference from
[17:17] like a normal kvc where you transfer
[17:19] money on there buy and then go to the
[17:22] cold wallet um take us through like what
[17:26] how does this work buying peer top
[17:30] Bitcoin so uh vexo is uh really not a
[17:35] financial
[17:36] institution uh so it's basically uh just
[17:40] uh
[17:41] Marketplace uh and uh it's marketplace
[17:45] where uh people can uh buy or sell
[17:49] Bitcoin and they they are listing their
[17:52] offers to the
[17:54] marketplace and uh like
[17:59] it works like uh within your Social
[18:03] Circle within your extended Social
[18:05] Circle so uh you can see offers from
[18:09] people that uh they got you in your
[18:12] contact list or people that uh somebody
[18:17] uh like friend of friend so like the
[18:19] second level of it uh it's the extended
[18:22] Social Circle and in the app you can see
[18:26] like the offer and in the Des
[18:29] description you have uh you
[18:32] have uh how many common friends with
[18:36] that person uh you have so if you uh if
[18:40] you want to buy Bitcoin uh and the other
[18:44] party is selling and you can see yeah I
[18:47] got uh I got common contact of uh I
[18:51] don't know uh like the organiz organizer
[18:57] of BTC PR Martin Kar or
[18:59] matash uh and somebody else uh and it's
[19:03] like up to 10 people uh I can say that
[19:08] uh this person can be reliable because
[19:10] of that because of the fact that uh 10
[19:14] of my friends uh got uh this uh this
[19:18] people in their contact list so you can
[19:22] you can react to the offer yeah I can I
[19:25] can uh buy Bitcoin from you and uh you
[19:29] enter uh encrypted uh chat uh end to end
[19:34] encrypted chat where you can uh talk
[19:37] details with the with the person about
[19:40] where you can meet uh like what uh What
[19:44] uh exchange rate you are trading the
[19:46] Bitcoin uh what fee and everything you
[19:50] you uh agree upon with uh with the with
[19:54] the person you are trading to and uh the
[19:59] like the fact that there is uh the list
[20:02] of common uh common friend uh it's uh
[20:07] because of that that you can uh reveal
[20:10] your identity with the with the person
[20:13] because what I didn't s it's like
[20:16] anonymized so uh if you can see the
[20:20] offer you cannot see the real uh person
[20:24] name who created you can see just the
[20:26] common friends and the uh the like
[20:30] important part when you reveal the
[20:33] identity you will have the full name of
[20:35] the person there and uh if you are not
[20:40] not sure if you are good to trade with
[20:43] that person you can always ask your
[20:45] common friends you can uh you can make a
[20:49] quick phone call uh and ask if if the
[20:53] this person you are supposed to trade
[20:56] Bitcoin with is reliable and and uh if
[21:00] the like if the two or three friends say
[21:03] yes it's it's my friend uh from high
[21:07] school uh you can really trust him uh
[21:09] then you can uh go and meet that person
[21:13] uh and give him the cash and he gives
[21:15] you the Bitcoin and and do it like
[21:19] peer-to-peer
[21:20] uh that's amazing um on the topic I'm
[21:24] always curious also like how people get
[21:26] get into Bitcoin and how people
[21:29] all like got over this hurdle of getting
[21:33] it like uh getting non KC Bitcoin coin
[21:36] mixing uh getting multi sick wallets and
[21:39] stuff like that this is the more
[21:40] advanced stuff for me uh but a step
[21:42] before that like every person that is in
[21:45] Bitcoin has done done a lot more
[21:49] homework on finance and money uh and
[21:53] privacy than 99% of the population uh so
[21:57] we are in a I think really special
[22:00] circle of of of people uh and I'm
[22:04] curious always like how we ended up here
[22:07] I mean this was kind of the start of the
[22:09] podcast where I was going down the
[22:11] Bitcoin Paths of of people now it's it's
[22:14] not even called the Bitcoin path anymore
[22:17] uh at the podcast I'm just curious about
[22:20] the person I made it more about the
[22:21] guest than about uh the bit PA of the
[22:24] guest but I'm still curious like uh you
[22:26] are very young uh I think you're
[22:29] probably around my age uh and how how
[22:32] old are you I'm 23 23 yeah you're two
[22:37] years younger than me uh um how did you
[22:41] get Bitcoin like how how did you get to
[22:44] bitcoin and how did you not get into
[22:47] altcoins shitcoins because I think a lot
[22:51] of people um especially in our age are
[22:54] getting a lot
[22:56] with getting fast into crypto to but not
[22:59] in
[23:00] Bitcoin yeah so uh it was like uh
[23:06] 2020 uh before the before the co hits
[23:10] and uh I had a lot of free time because
[23:15] uh I wasn't uh at college and I was
[23:18] playing only basketball this year
[23:21] and uh even when Co hits I I got a lot
[23:26] of free time and uh I started to looking
[23:30] on some ways how to uh make more money
[23:33] or something like that uh because uh I
[23:36] was student uh and uh it was like not
[23:40] that hard but it was
[23:42] challenging and uh yeah uh I found uh
[23:49] our like Czech most famous Bitcoin uh
[23:54] like streamer or podcaster or YouTuber
[23:57] and uh he was was he was really uh
[24:01] enthusiastic about about Bitcoin and I
[24:04] uh catch the vibe of of it and and was
[24:09] really interested uh from the from the
[24:12] from the first video and yeah I was
[24:16] studying everything uh when when there
[24:19] was like Co and the funny thing is
[24:24] that first I was studying it and and
[24:27] after I was like yeah I can I can buy
[24:30] some Bitcoin and I started uh like uh I
[24:34] think everybody uh and it it is like uh
[24:38] from coin coinbase and slowly uh I
[24:42] absorbed the uh the knowledge about
[24:45] about the non kyc uh mindset from the
[24:49] from the great uh czechoslovak people
[24:53] and uh it really resonated with me uh it
[24:58] really uh I think I really get it get
[25:02] the point of why that matters and from
[25:06] that very start I I I was uh I was using
[25:09] like the ATMs and after uh after uh the
[25:16] co phase was after uh I even started to
[25:22] started to go on some Bitcoin
[25:24] conferences and started to meet uh
[25:27] fellow Bitcoin coiners and creating the
[25:30] the like relationship with uh with that
[25:34] kind of people and uh yeah I created
[25:39] some social network and and now uh if I
[25:42] want to uh by or cell I can use I can
[25:46] use vexel because like my my reach or my
[25:50] uh social network is quite big so
[25:54] there's always uh anybody that is
[25:56] selling or buying so right now I'm I'm
[26:01] using just the peer to-peer uh kind of
[26:04] thing and uh yeah Bitcoin still
[26:07] fascinate fascinates me uh I even uh got
[26:11] a a Bitcoin job and it was my first job
[26:15] ever so uh it was great achievement for
[26:18] me too and uh to be able to work with
[26:22] the uh in that company satosi satosi
[26:26] Labs with with treasure and
[26:28] all the other guys it's like really it's
[26:32] like really the best school I can
[26:34] imagine and I would not uh I would not
[26:39] like change it change my path and uh and
[26:44] uh as you said uh I was from the very
[26:49] first uh start I was bitcoiner and I I I
[26:54] once uh I once buy AUM but yeah uh it
[26:58] didn't uh it didn't end up well or I I
[27:02] saw it and it's because the great uh
[27:05] great YouTubers that Czech Republic has
[27:08] that uh like I'm I'm bitcoiner and I'm
[27:12] proud proud to myself 21 Bitcoin is
[27:15] Bitcoin only from day one and they teach
[27:18] and preach self- custody this is my goto
[27:22] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[27:24] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[27:27] easiest entry four bitcoiners and if you
[27:30] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[27:32] support this podcast use code Robin and
[27:35] click the link in the description yeah
[27:38] that's that's very good uh I did go down
[27:41] the the shitcoin lane at some point
[27:43] unfortunately uh since since uh yeah I
[27:46] think since
[27:49] 2022 I'm completely clean of
[27:52] shitcoins so I'm I'm I'm proud since
[27:54] 2022 I'm clean of Bitcoin of of
[27:56] shitcoins uh and yeah Bitcoin would have
[28:00] been way better if I just St stood with
[28:03] Bitcoin and went more aggressive in
[28:05] Bitcoin but I think I'm still really
[28:08] early and I think everybody that's
[28:10] coming in this year or next year still
[28:12] is really early um and uh I think I
[28:16] released yesterday a
[28:18] podcast where the guest said that uh the
[28:21] FI system how we know it will fail in
[28:25] the next five years which I think is a
[28:27] very
[28:29] um aggressive timeline uh when you think
[28:33] of of greater things uh do do you do you
[28:36] see when you are now really young you're
[28:39] growing in this Bitcoin economy uh and
[28:41] you even working your first job in
[28:44] Bitcoin like you you don't know a world
[28:46] without it basically even though when
[28:49] you were born there was no bit yeah when
[28:51] you were born you there was no Bitcoin
[28:54] uh uh but basically since uh and that's
[28:58] that's also the case with me since I'm
[29:00] in my professional life there was always
[29:03] Bitcoin it was young it was really early
[29:07] uh but how do you see when we are making
[29:09] this generational shift where the older
[29:13] people eventually unfortunately die uh
[29:16] uh and the younger people come up and
[29:18] they only know about a world in Bitcoin
[29:22] how do you see this world uh switching
[29:25] to a Bitcoin standard and most
[29:27] importantly
[29:29] um how do you see this transition going
[29:32] like do you
[29:33] see good transition and it's like a a
[29:36] peaceful Revolution uh where the young
[29:38] people can lead uh and you mean young
[29:41] people it's it's weird to say but I
[29:43] checked my YouTube statistics I think a
[29:45] few days back and most of my listeners
[29:49] are like my average is like 45 or 50
[29:52] like it's like my average uh person
[29:55] viewing this channel is actually quite
[29:58] not old but 50 years you're in the
[30:00] middle age you're not old uh but in in a
[30:03] 25 year olds few uh and I even got like
[30:07] 10% above 65 which is really really
[30:10] crazy uh uh so like how do you see the
[30:14] shift going like when we have so many
[30:16] people on board and we're coming FAS and
[30:18] faster to this
[30:20] thing um I Heard uh last week a great
[30:24] thought uh that the young people will
[30:28] start to use better money uh and they
[30:32] will not ask anybody to do so because uh
[30:37] for them it will be uh like so uh like
[30:44] straightforward to use Bitcoin uh
[30:47] because it's uh how we know better money
[30:52] than than Fiat and uh when I thinking
[30:57] about the transition
[30:59] uh I would not say any like prediction
[31:04] or anything uh like that but I'm very
[31:07] optimistic about it and my whole life
[31:10] I've been optimistic
[31:13] and I think nothing ever going to change
[31:17] uh my point of view uh on the word and
[31:22] uh in that case that uh like good people
[31:27] lives
[31:28] uh uh on our planet so I'm very
[31:31] optimistic about it and I'm thinking
[31:34] that uh even the ETF uh ETF approval uh
[31:41] like uh personally I got nothing against
[31:44] it but uh I know some people are worried
[31:48] and uh I think it's completely fine and
[31:52] uh this was like the uh I think turning
[31:55] point in Bitcoin history sorry uh uh and
[32:00] I think it will be like much easier uh
[32:04] for the for the people and uh I'm very
[32:07] optimistic about about the transition
[32:10] and about the
[32:12] because I've been working in vexel uh
[32:15] for one year and uh I can see how how
[32:20] much treasure is developing how much uh
[32:22] other other parts of company are
[32:25] developing and
[32:28] about how the ecosystem is is developing
[32:30] that uh it makes me very optimistic and
[32:34] uh yeah I I'm I'm looking forward to it
[32:38] and uh yeah I think we uh will not have
[32:42] a future without Bitcoin and I think
[32:44] it's it's good amazing and you mentioned
[32:48] that uh vexel is a part of of Satoshi
[32:51] Labs bigger company where uh more
[32:54] companies are underneath that that Hood
[32:57] um maybe can can you give us a a quick
[32:59] overview what what companies are in this
[33:02] satosi Labs uh sphere mhm so sataps is
[33:07] holding uh that consists for uh four
[33:11] companies uh the first one and all this
[33:14] one is treasure uh treasure is the first
[33:18] haror wallet ever and they are doing uh
[33:22] products that uh keep your keys uh safe
[33:26] I think it's it's a great product but I
[33:28] am uh maybe I'm biased but I love I love
[33:33] it and other companies are inv uh and
[33:37] that's that's like uh they are trying to
[33:41] uh build kyc exchange and there are some
[33:44] like uh compare Tools in in in where you
[33:48] can find your best deals uh the third
[33:52] one is Tropic Square uh Tropic square is
[33:56] doing like first auditable chip uh like
[34:01] maybe open source but uh I'm not uh kind
[34:06] uh or into the topic so uh I don't know
[34:09] very much about it but it's really it's
[34:12] really cool that they are trying to
[34:14] solve some uh something in in Hardware
[34:18] kind of thing and the last company is
[34:20] wexel and yeah we are trying to build
[34:24] like peer-to-peer uh Bitcoin communities
[34:27] and
[34:28] and to give the people knowledge about
[34:31] the peer-to-peer and uh to build the
[34:34] tools to uh that people can
[34:38] use maybe you are biased uh for for that
[34:42] question but what do you think is the
[34:44] most important part of Sato Labs like
[34:47] what's what's the the the most important
[34:50] uh aspect that sat labsa is
[34:53] doing um I don't know because uh if
[34:57] treor wouldn't uh or wasn't created uh
[35:01] we got we would not have uh a like easy
[35:07] or private by how to secure our private
[35:10] keys so it's a really important part of
[35:15] company and it uh it uh you can see it
[35:20] like uh financially as well and uh I'm
[35:24] biased so I would say uh the number to
[35:28] is uh creating the tool for peer-to-peer
[35:31] trades and by the way I love invit guys
[35:34] and Tropic Square guys and shout out to
[35:37] them uh really really cool uh you also
[35:40] mentioned I think it's also in your
[35:42] Twitter bio that you're a professional
[35:45] uh was basketball player yes yes uh
[35:49] that's that's amazing I see more and
[35:51] more like bitcoiners are doing sports
[35:53] doing the proof of work with their
[35:55] physical body also um how do you see is
[35:58] is there connection between sports and
[36:00] Bitcoin personally like with the SP with
[36:03] the professional word uh not but I can
[36:06] see that people that uh are learning
[36:10] about Bitcoin that uh trying to do new
[36:14] things or trying to uh better their
[36:18] lives up uh they uh know about the proof
[36:22] of work kind of thing and uh they are
[36:25] like uh trying to
[36:28] uh get health Freer and to fit their
[36:31] body up and uh yeah do the proof of work
[36:36] thing
[36:37] so uh yeah that's it amazing uh let's go
[36:42] back to the social media thing I always
[36:45] find it fascinating when you are working
[36:47] in social media and I'm basically only
[36:49] doing this now with with podcast and
[36:51] Twitter uh and I'm doing a lot with with
[36:54] with communities and and with with
[36:56] companies and it's it's fascinating to
[36:59] see how deep you are into into topics
[37:03] and sometimes you you like you have to
[37:06] take a step back out and and see the
[37:08] bigger picture uh but what do you see as
[37:12] from your view when you're on social
[37:13] media when you're working with with the
[37:15] company when you're going as a private
[37:17] person also on on on those profiles what
[37:20] do you see as like the most important
[37:23] topic or like the the most interesting
[37:26] topic right now in in the Bitcoin
[37:28] Community uh besides non KC
[37:32] Bitcoin um like my Feit is all about uh
[37:38] ETF uh those past two months and uh yeah
[37:43] I can see it fascinating how how uh the
[37:48] demand like is now really really big and
[37:53] as of now uh I have not uh that uh much
[37:58] of free time uh to look to new ideas or
[38:02] to new kind of things to learn more
[38:06] about uh like some technical stuff and
[38:09] all the stuff so uh right now I'm I'm
[38:12] just trying to do uh my best uh in
[38:17] pushing vexel and trying to stay in the
[38:20] game to to be uh to to be in or to have
[38:25] the information about what's going on
[38:27] and what I can uh like engage with and
[38:31] what I can respond to and uh some of the
[38:36] stuff that's amazing and I uh just had a
[38:39] thought also when you're doing social
[38:40] media for vexel uh you also obviously
[38:43] want to try to grow it uh and you want
[38:46] to to try to make vexel um known in more
[38:51] more communities and uh my first thought
[38:54] is like the it's probably harder with a
[38:58] uh with a peer-to-peer network but then
[39:00] I thought like it's probably easier uh
[39:03] long term because you're building those
[39:05] communities and uh when someone is on
[39:08] waxel maybe meeting someone and like
[39:10] yeah hey let's let's do it let's um yeah
[39:14] um make a trade on vexel and the peers
[39:17] on vexel bring other peers also on vexel
[39:20] and it gets like to a community effect
[39:23] uh uh and to like a yeah almost like a
[39:27] social network where like I on Facebook
[39:31] we can trade there or like someone wants
[39:33] to onboard people do Bitcoin they're
[39:35] like oh go on vexel there you can find
[39:37] your Social Circle and stuff like that
[39:39] do you see
[39:41] those good forces like this those good
[39:43] networking effects also happening on on
[39:47] vexel yeah I think the spread of board
[39:50] kind of thing is really important and uh
[39:54] I would say uh gradually and suddenly
[39:58] uh and uh we can see uh like even even
[40:04] uh this like uh like this year where the
[40:09] traction of it uh was uh was better and
[40:13] better and we we even cross like the
[40:18] uh uh like 10K 10K users so uh and it's
[40:24] growing and growing uh and I think it's
[40:27] really important to uh to be the
[40:30] community based and to to have the
[40:33] people that uh maybe even loves you
[40:36] loves the product and tell tell other
[40:38] people maybe uh they are they are
[40:41] creating uh Meetup uh Meetup Community
[40:45] or something like that or even we have
[40:47] few podcast uh appearance with uh with
[40:51] with some other guys so uh it's
[40:54] important to share the share the word
[40:57] about it and to to push it like uh this
[41:01] way because uh What uh I haven't uh told
[41:05] you that we are like nonprofit
[41:07] organization and uh like the uh like our
[41:12] product is free and will forever will be
[41:15] free so uh we don't have uh the biggest
[41:19] marketing budget uh ever but uh with
[41:24] those amazing people that are pushing
[41:26] wexel more and more uh it's uh it's
[41:29] easier and easier to be able to grow The
[41:33] Social Network and how uh do you make
[41:37] money is is it like uh just value for
[41:40] value is it like uh people sponsoring
[41:44] you is it like Satoshi Labs keeping the
[41:47] project alive as a just nonprofit uh how
[41:50] how does this
[41:52] work uh yeah a big part of is uh is our
[41:56] fun fers or SATs fers and uh as of now
[42:01] we are trying to uh to get like uh more
[42:06] and more like Bitcoin grants we even got
[42:10] the first one from uh
[42:12] opats and uh yeah we are living uh from
[42:16] the donations and we are happy that uh
[42:20] if somebody uh can uh like contribute uh
[42:24] it's it's blessing for us
[42:27] amazing amazing perfect then uh we are
[42:30] coming to the end routine where the
[42:32] previous guest is asking a question for
[42:34] the next guest uh which I love it's like
[42:36] this this blockchain kind of thing um
[42:39] and your question is a really
[42:41] interesting
[42:42] one uh especially because you're young
[42:45] and you probably don't have children uh
[42:48] I use and this I will I will explain the
[42:51] question a little bit more after after I
[42:53] did it are you standing for your family
[42:56] in a sense of holding Bitcoin for them
[42:59] when they don't adopt it and we I talked
[43:02] with the previous guest about this uh
[43:04] that you have to be there for your
[43:07] family when hits the fan like and
[43:10] fear really
[43:12] collapses way sooner than we think and
[43:14] Bitcoin Rises way quicker than than we
[43:17] think uh and yeah your family did not
[43:20] get Bitcoin uh and I always try to stack
[43:25] not only for me but stacking keeping in
[43:28] mind for like my whole family which is
[43:30] really hard because I have a really big
[43:32] family with all the relatives and stuff
[43:33] like that uh um do you keep that in mind
[43:38] do you have this is in mind or what do
[43:41] you uh I has uh or I had it uh and like
[43:48] uh like last year or uh year ago uh I
[43:52] was trying to like help uh my friends um
[43:57] to give them some some books about
[43:59] Bitcoin or even like the hardware wallet
[44:02] and uh we talk about it uh a lot and uh
[44:10] I think the like the decision is uh upon
[44:14] the people but uh regarding the family
[44:18] uh I can see or I can see a way that uh
[44:24] I will be able to help uh my like uh in
[44:28] the future uh with Bitcoin and uh even
[44:32] with my stack kind of thing so uh yeah
[44:36] I'm all for this question and uh it's
[44:40] important because uh we are lucky to be
[44:44] this yearly we are lucky to uh like get
[44:48] the concept of Bitcoin uh really fast uh
[44:51] even before the Wall Street uh and uh
[44:55] it's really it's it's really important
[44:57] to be like uh how to say
[45:03] um like not be not be selfish uh with
[45:07] this thing and to be helpful and
[45:11] to um to help your family yeah amazing
[45:15] and uh thank you stepan for being on it
[45:18] was it was truly pleasure because I uh
[45:22] have this podcast with the goal as
