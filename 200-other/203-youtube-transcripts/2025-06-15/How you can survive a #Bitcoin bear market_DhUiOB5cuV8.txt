[00:00] the problem is that governments create
[00:02] more currency by one hold it by deced
[00:05] please do it and nobody did and I looked
[00:07] around I was like okay but where's the
[00:09] B so hello Dorian how are you hi Robin
[00:13] thank you for having me on so today we
[00:16] have a first episode where the guest so
[00:20] you Dorian uh uh chose to be completely
[00:24] private my first question would be why
[00:27] is it important for you and uh would you
[00:29] Rec recomend that for for all the people
[00:32] or is it just um just your thing like
[00:35] why are you doing that well I have a
[00:37] private life that I need to protect is
[00:39] the reason why there were uh situations
[00:44] where people have been under
[00:47] pressure because somebody suspected them
[00:49] to own Bitcoin and I just want to avoid
[00:53] that fate for myself for my
[00:55] family but I still want to share my
[00:59] insights with people listening to this
[01:02] podcast for
[01:03] example and this is the the kind of you
[01:07] know middle ground that I choose to walk
[01:11] oh that's that's perfect and how much uh
[01:15] if for a normal person how much privacy
[01:17] would you say is enough privacy like um
[01:21] some go the extreme route say no inex at
[01:24] all for some maybe even a podcast like
[01:26] that for you would be too much uh um
[01:30] giving from a private life but how much
[01:32] privacy for the normal person would be
[01:35] enough privacy I think it depends on
[01:37] your profile if you're somebody who got
[01:40] involved relatively late and you have no
[01:45] problem with telling people that then I
[01:47] think you can you can you're probably
[01:50] fine with revealing much more about
[01:53] yourself but if you're somebody who's
[01:55] been in Bitcoin for longer then people
[01:58] will suspect that you have a big and
[02:01] that puts that put the Target on your so
[02:04] if you're let's say 20 years old you're
[02:06] probably fine like nobody's going to
[02:07] give a dam about you but if you're but
[02:11] it's a different thing if you it's
[02:12] you're 20 and you brag about having made
[02:15] a killing in the altcoin
[02:16] market then then then it might be a
[02:19] different
[02:20] story so I think it depends on a number
[02:22] of factors basically what you're
[02:24] comfortable with and and how much how
[02:26] much you have to lose or
[02:28] protect and and you got into Bitcoin I
[02:31] think you said 10 years ago almost yes
[02:36] almost why did you get into Bitcoin at
[02:38] the first place and is the reason why
[02:41] you're still in Bitcoin different now I
[02:43] have to say my my story with Bitcoin is
[02:46] kind of a love story I think because um
[02:51] the longer I've been in Bitcoin the more
[02:53] I like
[02:54] it I initially got involved because I
[02:58] saw some random guy talk about it on
[03:00] Facebook back when I was still on
[03:02] there on a completely unrelated topic he
[03:06] just brought it up he was I don't know
[03:08] throwing it out there trying to Orange
[03:09] kill
[03:10] people
[03:12] and I had no idea about well basically
[03:15] anything but you know what it's like to
[03:17] be um young in your 20s and you think
[03:20] that you know everything and you're very
[03:22] confident about your
[03:24] ability when you're activ
[03:28] not
[03:30] and I was kind of in this space in my
[03:31] life for a had lot time on my hands I
[03:34] was doing studies
[03:38] University and so I just I saw this and
[03:41] I I started to look at it and back then
[03:44] early
[03:46] 2014 it wasn't so easy to find
[03:49] anything um I I did find enough for
[03:53] myself but everything was a little bit
[03:55] more Technical and complicated back
[03:58] then
[04:01] and at first I I looked at it and what
[04:04] people always say is that first you
[04:06] dismiss it and first you laugh about it
[04:08] and they think it's a scam and all of
[04:09] that but that really wasn't the case for
[04:11] me I I took three months took a deep
[04:15] dive went all in my mind at
[04:19] first and um and then I just decided to
[04:24] buy and throughout the years 2014 and 15
[04:28] and ever since then my appreciation for
[04:31] this technology and what it is and and
[04:34] what what the potential for
[04:36] for large are have not been changed much
[04:43] I think
[04:45] that the one thing that I would like to
[04:47] say is that Bitcoin
[04:49] itself although it hasn't changed that
[04:51] much since
[04:53] then I have to say that how I perceive
[04:56] it has changed because back then I was
[04:58] looking at this and I said okay this is
[04:59] either going to a million or to zero
[05:02] also my right I will put a little bit
[05:05] into it what back then it's all I had
[05:07] but
[05:08] um but I thought okay this is binary
[05:11] this is either going to go insanely high
[05:13] or it's just going to fade away and so
[05:16] back then I think it was most
[05:18] speculative even though I really wanted
[05:20] it to succeed because I thought of the
[05:21] implications for the world's poorest
[05:24] people for whom this town has enormous
[05:27] implications and
[05:30] I think what's changed in then is that
[05:32] it's become so intense that you no
[05:34] longer have to look at it as spe I think
[05:36] that with all of these SP markets and
[05:38] all of the um Doom Loops that we've
[05:41] potentially entered already that never
[05:43] came to pass in reality um you can say
[05:47] that this is no longer a the speculation
[05:48] you can probably look at it and say okay
[05:50] this is a savings vehicle at this point
[05:53] for being not so faint apart and I still
[05:56] have to say that but if you have the
[05:58] conviction and you don't um throw away
[06:03] like throwing the towel and end up doing
[06:04] a bar Market if you have a conviction
[06:06] and you keep buying all the way and if
[06:09] you have a
[06:11] solid balance sheet or income statement
[06:14] or whatever in your personal life where
[06:15] you make more money than you
[06:17] spend then I think that this is a great
[06:20] solution for a big problem that fa is
[06:23] human as a whole at this used to be the
[06:25] case that at least when I first got
[06:27] involved that in Europe on the western
[06:30] world that uh Bitcoin wasn't needed they
[06:33] just didn't need it the government was
[06:35] mostly been on your side and um wasn't
[06:38] trying
[06:39] to pull the wool over anybody's eyes but
[06:43] now they are and um this was mostly a
[06:46] problem for the world's poorest in
[06:48] places like African countries a lot of
[06:50] Asian
[06:51] countries middle Ean and so on South
[06:54] America where you have high inflation
[06:56] where the government is not really under
[06:59] your side but I think that ever since
[07:01] 2020 people have now realized that in
[07:03] the west we're in a similar trajectory
[07:06] in many ways and Bitcoin is a way to to
[07:11] protect against some of that not all of
[07:13] it obviously a thir
[07:17] one great and so 10 years ago the price
[07:22] was like what was it round
[07:25] about between I think the cheapest I saw
[07:29] it was like
[07:31] 1880 or 200 or something like that so
[07:35] it's fair to say you saw Bitcoin rising
[07:37] up really fast and also rising up uh
[07:41] down a lot how is this living through uh
[07:44] seeing your net worth double 3x 4X 5x
[07:48] and then crashing down I don't know 80%
[07:51] 70% what what in there it's not
[07:55] good I have to say it isn't good for you
[07:58] because
[08:00] first of all it concerns you especially
[08:03] if you're young you get cocky you make
[08:05] mistakes you um say things that you're
[08:08] probably not too proud of later
[08:11] on and it can be very humbling in the
[08:13] bare market and that part I think is is
[08:17] great for um developing strong character
[08:20] but the bull markets are with the
[08:22] mistakes I'm made for
[08:23] sure I you can make the mistake of
[08:25] setting the bottom uh in the bare Market
[08:27] too and of I can't say I've seen people
[08:32] in my personal s do that but um there
[08:36] are definitely stories about that and
[08:39] then I've made mistakes and I've tried
[08:40] to learn but I think it's very
[08:43] stressful yeah it's that's why I think
[08:46] the the line stay humble and stack SS is
[08:49] so important it's it's it's for me even
[08:52] a Cheesy line it's like a line that uh a
[08:55] lot of people say really fast but
[08:58] especially if you live through the be
[09:00] and the bull market it's very
[09:03] important did you ever experience with
[09:06] altcoins uh in those 10 years oh yeah
[09:08] you had a lot that's why I meant the
[09:10] mistakes are made during the bull market
[09:14] oh Market is uh is something I want to
[09:17] talk about too but but I would like to
[09:19] start somewhere else first if you don't
[09:22] mind yeah
[09:23] start okay so um we were just talking
[09:26] about the bare market and I want to give
[09:28] my two SS on how to survive them because
[09:30] they can be very brutal especially if if
[09:33] like for most people this is what
[09:35] happens right they get attacked to the
[09:36] writing T they get in and it drops their
[09:38] exit liquidity for the big guys and then
[09:41] they're looking at a staring at a loss
[09:44] for C know how long three years
[09:46] sometimes so I'm guessing um because
[09:49] most people don't have the wisdom to
[09:52] just use the bar Market to buy more and
[09:54] especially because if you can have you
[09:56] buy in the bull market you don't have
[09:57] any by poct to put into the market get
[09:59] in
[10:01] that so this can be gring how do you
[10:04] survice that well I think you have to
[10:07] think about
[10:09] um two parts first part is that there's
[10:13] two sides of um problem that we're
[10:17] looking at here the problem has C which
[10:22] is inflation the creation of
[10:26] currency and the
[10:28] solution we just opt out and go into
[10:32] Bitcoin and we can talk about all the
[10:35] reasons for for inflation why there will
[10:37] be more of it um in a moment but when
[10:42] you're in B planine you have to remember
[10:45] that you are not part of the problem you
[10:48] are part of the solution and I think
[10:50] this is what gives people hope what
[10:52] makes them stronger what makes them keep
[10:54] their endurance because I've said it
[10:55] before right and I've been asked this
[10:57] many times would you rather they like
[10:59] would you rather Bitcoin succeeds but
[11:02] you make no money off of it or it fails
[11:04] but you become rich and i' told them
[11:05] again and again that I would rather I
[11:08] would rather not make any money off of
[11:10] this because it means that it succeeds
[11:13] and we can we can become Freer as a as a
[11:17] species and so I think that being on the
[11:19] right side of history and being able to
[11:21] look in the mirror and say okay
[11:23] I I really did what I
[11:27] could no I was doing as much as for
[11:30] myself and this is what what it means
[11:32] like if
[11:34] if the market they Su really
[11:38] and and they can be very humbly
[11:40] individual but you have to know that
[11:43] you're not alone in this there are other
[11:45] people out
[11:47] there they are showing the same strength
[11:50] and together you will get through
[11:53] this and when you come outside the other
[11:56] end you can you know
[12:00] that you were being part of the
[12:03] solution and you get stronger each cycle
[12:07] with that um probably but the Cycles
[12:11] also they become less and less um
[12:14] painful I
[12:15] say I was very lucky to find out when I
[12:18] did it because I was able to buy it
[12:22] almost the entire bottom of the 2014 15
[12:26] G Market had I known about Bitcoin one
[12:27] year earlier I might have gotten wrecked
[12:30] in a big way because we had the cute run
[12:32] up to a
[12:34] thousand and then down to 200 and who
[12:37] knows what would have happened so I got
[12:39] very lucky with
[12:41] that but now we can talk about the the
[12:44] now that we talked about the solution
[12:45] and and how you can be part of that and
[12:48] how we have to talk about the problem
[12:49] all right so what is the problem the
[12:52] problem is
[12:53] that governments create more
[12:56] currency and more and more more and more
[12:59] right and what is what what does that
[13:03] do um they they call it
[13:07] inflation and or actually they they call
[13:09] the effects of this they call that
[13:11] inflation they call the increase in
[13:13] prices
[13:15] inflation and try to pull the wool over
[13:18] our eyes that way what it really is is
[13:21] Attack on four because if you rich then
[13:24] you actually quite like this you like
[13:26] the C because it pushes up the value of
[13:29] all the things that are scares which are
[13:31] owned by the the r right they own the
[13:35] stocks they own the real estate and
[13:37] that's the stuff that goes up to and
[13:39] they don't care if if milk suddenly
[13:42] costs twice as much as it did before but
[13:44] if you're poor you don't own any of the
[13:45] things that go up with inflation you
[13:47] only have a fixed income which tends to
[13:50] not go up with inflation at least not as
[13:51] much as it
[13:56] it's and that is is why that is why um
[14:01] inflation isn't really a test it's a
[14:04] test on the poor and people have to
[14:06] understand that and because the poor
[14:07] tend to be the ones that are financially
[14:09] literate they don't know that this is
[14:11] happening they can feel it more so now
[14:13] than ever but they don't know that they
[14:15] are being C here in in in
[14:19] particular and so the government like to
[14:22] in in levit taxes that people don't
[14:25] resist because if you suddenly s out and
[14:28] you in this evaluated at a tax or or
[14:32] other taxes that are more
[14:35] specific then people would resist them
[14:37] more and you think about 2020 and what
[14:39] they did
[14:40] then is that inflation can feel good at
[14:44] first you know people like staying at
[14:46] home still getting paid they
[14:49] did but now they have to pay for it and
[14:53] there's a time lag between and so people
[14:55] can't make the connection unless we
[14:57] diate them and point the
[14:59] up there's other reasons for why
[15:01] inflation is the preferred tax of
[15:03] governments for example it pushes people
[15:05] into higher tax practice and um you
[15:07] always have a delay in the cost of
[15:10] living adjustments for pensioners for
[15:11] example so they have to live with higher
[15:13] cost and then they get the raise a year
[15:15] later in the meantime the government
[15:20] benefits and also and this is I think
[15:22] under preal is by how much productivity
[15:24] gains help governments create inflation
[15:27] because if you can pay your with CED
[15:30] currency prices would have gone down
[15:33] because productivity has gone up but
[15:35] they they still have people don't know
[15:38] this and there's a cool website that you
[15:40] can look at called WTF happened in 1971c
[15:44] where you can look at it ever since the
[15:46] world uh the world has gone up the gold
[15:49] standard you've had incredible
[15:51] productivity gains that were not
[15:53] captured by raising by higher weight and
[15:57] that I think is not acquainted then you
[16:01] have um well one important reason that
[16:04] I'd like to to add is that the system
[16:07] that we currently have as a system
[16:10] requires increasing levels
[16:14] of currency because this is something
[16:17] that we have to credit Mike Maloney for
[16:19] pointing this
[16:21] up at least that's how I learned about
[16:23] it when you have new
[16:26] currency being created you have to
[16:29] pay that back with
[16:31] interest but when you take that money to
[16:33] pay the interest right it doesn't exist
[16:36] so we have to create more currency to
[16:37] pay the
[16:38] interest and that puts you eventually on
[16:40] a path to hyperinflation because
[16:43] eventually you cannot pay the interest
[16:46] unless you trate more currency and I
[16:48] think that the higher interest rates
[16:50] are the stronger this effect can
[16:54] become and so even though higher
[16:57] interest rates that we have right now
[16:59] might put a temporary break on inflation
[17:03] because it encourages people to spend
[17:04] less and save more I think in the long
[17:08] run those higher interest rates will
[17:11] necessitate higher
[17:13] inflation but I would be happy to be
[17:16] corrected on that I'm not
[17:19] 100% but if we um assume that high
[17:25] inflation means that we get high
[17:26] inflation also in the future this means
[17:29] that we will crash eventually with with
[17:32] the Fiat system uh do you see that
[17:34] coming in the next 50 years uh 10 years
[17:38] or is it something that can be kicked
[17:40] down the road a long time when I first
[17:43] learned about all of this I was like I
[17:44] have to tell everybody and if I'm if I
[17:48] figure this out then you know tomorrow
[17:50] everybody's going to know because I'm
[17:51] not that smart and so everybody else is
[17:54] going to know this too and how come I
[17:55] learn about this and nobody else has so
[17:57] this is going to Quest tomorrow
[18:01] right and then you get older and you
[18:03] look around and you explain the stuff to
[18:04] people and you see the blanks there and
[18:07] the next thing they talk about is the
[18:09] game um then you realize okay this is
[18:14] probably going to go on a lot longer
[18:15] than I thought and so right now I'm very
[18:18] pessimistic about all of this I mean I
[18:20] used to be in the of the opinion that
[18:22] I'd rather have it crash now than late
[18:24] rather than sooner than later
[18:27] because I then that wouldn't be as bad
[18:30] but I think we've gotten to the point
[18:31] where it's going to be terrible no
[18:32] matter when it
[18:34] pops
[18:37] and I have no idea when it's going to
[18:40] pop I've seen a very humbling interview
[18:43] by Dr casc talking about this stuff uh
[18:46] in 1981 or
[18:49] so so who
[18:52] knows yeah 981 uh almost 50 years now
[18:58] yeah so he probably never in his Wildest
[19:00] Dreams imagined that we would still
[19:03] be on this path by now crazy and if we
[19:07] come now back about the numbers they are
[19:09] getting actually let me just add this
[19:11] the numbers are getting crazy large so
[19:12] if you think about the United States of
[19:14] America They just added one trillion
[19:17] trillion and and and people don't
[19:19] appreciate this number of new death in
[19:23] the last quarter in as opposed the
[19:25] strong economy so the numbers are
[19:27] getting to the point where it's just so
[19:29] abely large
[19:31] that Trump at least talked about paying
[19:34] down the debt I think he was the first
[19:36] one in a long time but I don't think
[19:37] even he would talk about that anymore I
[19:39] think that um nobody in the right mind
[19:45] would would even say that that's a
[19:47] remote possibility I think that
[19:49] everybody at least behind doors closed
[19:51] doors they would say okay there's only
[19:53] one solution to this and
[19:55] that's that's not really a solution
[19:58] because it destroy
[20:01] society and you can see this all around
[20:04] us destitution is is just off the charts
[20:07] I
[20:08] think it's under reported but a lot of
[20:10] people are
[20:12] just getting poor real quick right now
[20:15] is cbdc uh a possibility for the
[20:19] government to keep it on
[20:21] longer does it help them to keep it
[20:24] running
[20:26] longer probably yeah I I think so I
[20:29] think that's the plan right I think that
[20:31] they are pushing a lot of people into
[20:32] poverty and then they offer the solution
[20:34] hey you can pay your bills but you have
[20:36] to use a government script for
[20:39] that I think that's the plan and then we
[20:42] when we now come back to why Bitcoin why
[20:46] no altcoin why no gold why no stocks why
[20:49] no everything else like why is Bitcoin
[20:51] now the perfect solution and why isn't
[20:55] it like all the
[20:57] others is the best solution it's not the
[21:00] perfect one it's not the only one people
[21:03] tend to ignore the fact that people are
[21:06] different so for my parents for example
[21:09] I would never get them um into Bitcoin
[21:12] in a big way
[21:14] because they just need something that
[21:17] doesn't fluctuate as much in value and I
[21:19] think both works better for them than it
[21:21] would and you have to be able to stomach
[21:24] the bare Market you have to not get coly
[21:27] in the in the bull market and I think
[21:29] that's something that's very unique to
[21:31] each person I think gold is going to
[21:34] protect people just fine um but it has
[21:38] to be in your own possession and it has
[21:41] to be real and this is something that I
[21:43] think works fine for for older people I
[21:46] think that it would be responsible to on
[21:49] board older people unless you explain
[21:51] everything in detail to them they
[21:52] understand it they can take self-
[21:54] custody and they know what they're doing
[21:55] and that's difficult and so
[21:58] I think gold is going to work just fine
[22:00] it just just doesn't have the upside
[22:02] potential that Bitcoin
[22:03] has
[22:05] um but it will protect and have
[22:08] protected people from from falling into
[22:10] destitution and being
[22:13] debased for a long time um with alt
[22:16] coins is a different story I think with
[22:18] alt coins the probabilities are
[22:20] overwhelmingly against
[22:23] you there's a huge number of reasons for
[22:26] why that is
[22:29] and I think that what people have to
[22:30] keep in mind is that you can't buy alt
[22:33] coins you just can't buy them you can
[22:36] buy specific alts but you can't buy the
[22:39] ones that are going to go up next
[22:41] because you don't know which ones are
[22:43] going to do that
[22:45] right we have to look at how many there
[22:47] are there's Millions at this
[22:50] point people can make them out of in
[22:52] there and they do and I think
[22:55] that the the ODS are just read against
[22:58] St against you if you try to play in
[22:59] that you know you can play State you can
[23:03] just ignore them all and you can just
[23:05] focus on the one that has the T of time
[23:08] better than all of the
[23:10] others but the lind effect the longest
[23:13] something thing has existed the more
[23:14] likely it is to continue to exist in the
[23:16] future and that one is definitely on the
[23:19] side of gold on the one hand that's is
[23:22] why people like it so much but it's also
[23:24] on the side of Bitcoin when it comes to
[23:26] digital currency and so another thing
[23:29] that I would like to add and this is be
[23:30] probably a bit too difficult to
[23:33] understand for most people but I I'd
[23:34] like to say it anyway the more often we
[23:36] repeat it the more likely they are to
[23:38] understand it is that a blockchain the
[23:42] technology used by digital currencies
[23:43] for the most
[23:45] part it's just a very very slow and
[23:49] inefficient database that's all it is
[23:52] and people think that the blockchain is
[23:54] going to solve every problem it's not
[23:55] the blockchain itself is fa boring and
[23:59] useless it has
[24:01] only it has it has so many different
[24:04] thought acts that you would never use it
[24:06] for
[24:07] anything except the one thing where you
[24:10] cannot live with the one thing that it
[24:12] does
[24:14] offer and that's decentralization you
[24:16] don't need this for projects you don't
[24:19] need this for data you need this only
[24:22] where it matters to not and that's money
[24:25] because money is half of every
[24:27] transaction out there money is most
[24:30] important technology that we have
[24:32] because it it is required for
[24:34] civilization to function we
[24:37] cannot coordinate big projects that is
[24:41] running it modern
[24:43] economy at all if we don't have a way to
[24:46] communicate
[24:48] value and express that in
[24:51] numbers which is why even though as bad
[24:54] as National currencies are they're still
[24:56] around because we just couldn't function
[24:59] without
[25:00] them and and I think that I think that
[25:04] people could appreciate this point a
[25:05] little bit more then they would probably
[25:08] understand that um only need a
[25:11] blockchain for money nothing
[25:13] else and when you look at the history of
[25:16] money you see that there's so many
[25:18] different currencies and the only reason
[25:20] they still exist is because the
[25:22] governments forced people to hold them
[25:24] and use them but I think absent those
[25:27] decrees there would only be one currency
[25:30] because you just have the Apex currency
[25:33] the United States dollar and there's so
[25:36] many countries that use the dollar even
[25:38] though they
[25:39] don't have any reason to other than the
[25:42] fact that they need a functioning
[25:44] money and so I think
[25:47] that um you can see this is gold and
[25:50] silver too when both were still used as
[25:51] money you had relatively stable exchange
[25:53] rates but ever since um they both
[25:56] stopped doing money silver just went
[25:58] down against gold because it's just the
[26:01] inferior currency it has
[26:03] a um a
[26:05] higher wait the stock of low race your
[26:08] favor
[26:10] C
[26:12] so so you can see the same thing with
[26:14] Bitcoin and the altcoins I think in the
[26:16] long run is that these altcoins will
[26:21] drop against Bitcoin they pop up here
[26:23] and there but over the long run they go
[26:27] down because bitcoin's hardness is just
[26:29] ever going to increase and the altcoins
[26:32] all compete with each other you you have
[26:34] to remember that I think some extent
[26:35] they compete with Bitcoin especially
[26:37] when it comes to
[26:38] speculation but I don't think that they
[26:40] compete at all on the on the savings
[26:42] front of
[26:43] things yeah and I think uh once you get
[26:46] really educated on bitcoin and the
[26:49] technology behind it you realize that
[26:52] only Bitcoin makes sense uh and you you
[26:56] you're more likely there there's for me
[26:59] different stages you go through like the
[27:01] first stage oh Bitcoin cryptocurrency
[27:03] then you may have oh I have Bitcoin and
[27:06] some others as a insurance for for
[27:09] example ethereum and and katano and
[27:12] stuff like that but as as you go on um
[27:16] examp at least for me it was like that
[27:18] you see like oh only Bitcoin actually
[27:20] makes sense the Kos this is some money
[27:23] and I realized that last year what you
[27:25] said with the blockchain because it's an
[27:27] inefficient uh way to store data uh I'm
[27:31] I'm myself a software developer and um a
[27:36] lot of people know that's the future of
[27:38] video games and stuff like that but I
[27:39] don't think so because there will be a
[27:41] point where those tokens uh lose value
[27:44] then they have to realize that uh
[27:47] blockchain is not the best way to to
[27:50] store uh the data of the video game and
[27:53] it would be more efficient and
[27:55] economically variable uh to just use a
[27:58] normal
[28:01] database and yeah so but uh let's see
[28:04] where where where this goes but I
[28:06] completely agree with you uh and maybe
[28:09] for Bitcoin now you saw the last 10
[28:13] years you know about gos history with
[28:15] thousands of years of history and the
[28:18] Linder Factor where as long it it uh it
[28:22] exists the longer it's likely to exist
[28:25] how far are we with have come on the
[28:28] Bitcoin side like where are we right now
[28:31] are we really early um when you see gos
[28:34] history that that long um why did we
[28:39] went so fast also on on on
[28:43] bitcoin I think I think we haven't come
[28:46] very far at
[28:48] all we certainly come further than I I
[28:51] mean I didn't write this down back then
[28:52] I wish have
[28:54] had I'm not sure if we either my
[28:56] expectations or we missed
[28:58] them I I don't
[29:02] know I don't think we're very very far
[29:05] ahead on all of this but I think that
[29:07] 2020 accelerated everything and
[29:10] especially the confiscation of
[29:14] assets that we've seen in the wake of of
[29:16] the Ukraine war I think these things
[29:18] kind of accelerated that d a
[29:22] lot and I think that big things are now
[29:26] happening behind closed doors that you
[29:28] will not know
[29:31] until a while in the future but I think
[29:34] people are discussing this stuff I mean
[29:35] think about
[29:37] it the Central Bank of
[29:40] Iran is buying all of the Bitcoin Min
[29:43] there at least they say they are or at
[29:45] least that's what their dictate is and
[29:48] they're using it to pay for import
[29:51] because Iran has lot of restrictions
[29:55] can't really use any other currency but
[29:58] Bitcoin can't be stocks and especially
[30:00] if they mind the blocks themselves they
[30:01] can include them in in in the blockchain
[30:03] and so they can't be censored either and
[30:05] I think the more I mean this is a big
[30:08] country like how many millions of people
[30:10] are there 60 million or something or 80
[30:11] I'm not sure but lots of people living
[30:14] there and they're economically weak and
[30:17] unimportant but I think that other
[30:18] people are going to look at this and say
[30:21] okay what if our stuff gets confiscated
[30:24] what if we get on the wrong side of the
[30:25] power thaty and we we need a backup plan
[30:29] you have a small country I think it's
[30:32] boan I'm not sure they have a lot of
[30:34] hydrop power and they're mining Bitcoin
[30:35] have done so for years they just
[30:37] recently disclosed that and you have El
[30:41] Salvador um they are
[30:43] stacking and and it was always going to
[30:46] be the small and and poor countries the
[30:49] ones with excess energy that they don't
[30:52] know what to do
[30:53] with that was definitely my prediction
[30:56] so
[30:58] obviously and I think I have to say this
[31:00] because there's nothing new Under the
[31:02] Sun as they say everything I say pretty
[31:06] much isn't my fault this is stuff that
[31:10] I've picked up over the years I have to
[31:13] credit people like Andreas Antonopoulos
[31:15] and Stephanie Murphy and Adam B LaVine
[31:18] for educating me and
[31:21] and toy mister and and people like that
[31:25] because I'm basically they just have a
[31:27] thing that they said so I don't want to
[31:29] give up the impression that I'm just
[31:31] genius at
[31:32] all
[31:34] um what what they said and what I will
[31:37] tell you now is what I agree with is
[31:39] that it was always going to be the small
[31:43] Nations that were going to adopt this
[31:45] first and they were going to skip some
[31:49] of the steps that we in the west
[31:51] took so if you think about telephone
[31:55] land lines we have them
[31:58] but we don't use them
[32:00] anymore and four countries never got
[32:04] them they went straight to to wireless
[32:08] technology and so I
[32:11] think I think it will be similar here
[32:14] the poor countries where Bitcoin is
[32:17] going to prosper first because at least
[32:21] until 2020 it wasn't necessary to do
[32:23] that here in the
[32:26] West so that is part of how far we've
[32:29] come I think there's always been some
[32:32] perversion going on in in in financial
[32:34] markets where you
[32:36] have Futures and Futures ETFs which make
[32:40] no sense at all and you have you're
[32:43] going to have an ETF at some point I
[32:45] think
[32:47] and what I really like about Bitcoin is
[32:50] that it doesn't care like you can make
[32:52] an ETF people can buy it people can
[32:53] store it people can sell it
[32:56] whatever doesn't fit the vision of
[32:59] Bitcoin at all that is just pure
[33:02] speculation and and I think it's going
[33:05] to do a a huge disservice honestly I
[33:07] think that the ETF is is a net negative
[33:10] for for Bitcoin because even though it
[33:13] means that we might become richer than
[33:15] we otherwise would
[33:17] be I think it's satisfaction and it
[33:20] think I think that it will if you can't
[33:24] withdraw from that as far as I know you
[33:26] can't do anything with it except or
[33:28] against
[33:30] it and so I think that this
[33:34] is it's not something we should be
[33:36] cheering for it's not something we
[33:38] should be happy about it just misses the
[33:41] point completely in my
[33:44] opinion interesting yeah like the the
[33:46] Bros for an Bitcoin spot ETF uh in in my
[33:51] opinion or what what what I saw till now
[33:53] is that it brings a lot of marketing
[33:56] budget to it because because there will
[33:57] be more spot ETFs they will make events
[34:00] they will they will try to convince
[34:03] everybody to invest their money with
[34:04] with them like black Rog is competing
[34:07] with Fidelity Fidelity with all the
[34:09] others um so I think it will bring a lot
[34:12] of attention to bitcoin if it's good or
[34:15] bad in the long term I'm also not sure
[34:17] about uh but the one thing I'm really
[34:20] sure about it just will bring a lot of
[34:22] attention and and and and eyeballs uh on
[34:26] bit coin um but maybe it would have came
[34:31] anyways like I think we we cannot stop
[34:33] in Bitcoin spot FDF and I think that uh
[34:36] bit Bitcoin will not be stopped by
[34:39] Bitcoin spot ETF like it it just does
[34:41] not care at all
[34:45] Agee I
[34:48] just I just don't think this is what it
[34:50] was supposed to be about not about the
[34:53] price I think is the least important or
[34:55] relevant or interesting thing about it
[34:57] but then again I have had very little
[34:59] success in conveying my message so far
[35:02] so maybe a rising price is the thing
[35:04] that we
[35:06] need yeah I think who was it C Mo that
[35:10] said number go up technology is the best
[35:12] marketing tool for Bitcoin right now I
[35:15] think he said because I've had because I
[35:19] have to say like I have had people come
[35:22] to me privately and congratulate me on
[35:24] my call because they didn't believe it
[35:27] when I said it in 2015 or something and
[35:29] it's still not buying right so um I I
[35:34] can't tell you how frustrating it's
[35:38] been because I was literally walking
[35:40] through my life slapping people left and
[35:44] right not well
[35:46] figuratively and telling them hey 200
[35:49] EUR come
[35:50] on buy one hold it for a decade please
[35:54] do
[35:55] it and nobody did so uh that wasn't the
[35:59] only thing I I did but back then I could
[36:02] really with a clear conscience tell
[36:04] people hey this is this is the
[36:08] fans of your lifetime whereas right now
[36:12] I can't do that anymore because if
[36:13] people buy at
[36:16] 44,000
[36:18] then they can't afford one Bitcoin most
[36:21] of them and they're not going to even if
[36:22] they could they're not going to buy one
[36:24] and um and it's not going
[36:27] to change their life in the same
[36:30] way as if they put in the same amount of
[36:33] money back then in
[36:35] 2015 and so I don't really do that
[36:37] anymore I don't walk around I'm telling
[36:39] people this is going to make you rich I
[36:41] used to do that didn't work don't do
[36:42] that
[36:44] anymore I tell people to become so self
[36:48] Sovereign and to take control of their
[36:51] of another aspect of their life when
[36:53] when they while they took because
[36:57] people ask me what do you need this for
[37:00] what's the use case you can just sell it
[37:01] that's all you can do with it and I tell
[37:03] them
[37:04] well not really you can take it with you
[37:08] without anybody noticing and that is a
[37:11] big thing because what other technology
[37:12] or what other kind kind of money can you
[37:14] do that with you cannot do this with any
[37:17] Bearer
[37:18] asset and this is the2 what is a bearer
[37:22] asset this is something that has
[37:25] value without anybody else having to to
[37:28] back it or to pay for it or anything
[37:30] like that like if if you have a
[37:34] bond if the person owes who like to S
[37:37] the bond they don't pay then the bond is
[37:38] worthless right if you have a piece of
[37:40] gold then the gold itself has value and
[37:43] with Bitcoin it's the same thing and I
[37:45] think people are going to appreciate
[37:47] what it means to hold their Assets in
[37:49] the future ESP with our inflation and
[37:52] with broken promises because there will
[37:54] be lots of
[37:55] those
[37:57] yeah starts to or killing people I am
[38:00] really bad at that I haven't had much
[38:02] success at all and so I try to tell
[38:05] people hey um this is a situation it's
[38:08] going to get a lot worse why don't you
[38:10] do something proactively and people
[38:11] don't believe me they don't I think
[38:14] laziness is huge and intellectual
[38:17] laziness yeah I noticed that like I
[38:21] obviously I'm on social media with my
[38:23] name everybody knows that I'm the
[38:25] Bitcoin guy in the the environment in
[38:28] the friends and the family circles like
[38:30] I'm well known for Bitcoin and I stopped
[38:33] bringing up Bitcoin I think one and a
[38:36] half years ago two years ago one year
[38:38] something around that corner and I
[38:40] noticed that people come to me when they
[38:44] really want to know about it and that's
[38:46] when you can really have an good
[38:48] conversation and really
[38:51] um but that's all I ever get that's a
[38:55] conversation they ask question questions
[38:57] they uh they're really surface L of
[39:01] questions usually nobody really takes
[39:03] deep enough because as I think one of
[39:06] your other guests mentions you need to
[39:09] spend the time there is no way around it
[39:12] you have to do this yourself because
[39:14] people sometimes come up to me and they
[39:15] say hey can you help me set this up and
[39:17] can we do this together and all of that
[39:19] and I tell them well I can teach you but
[39:22] you have to do this yourself you have to
[39:24] understand what you're doing because if
[39:25] not then the be IR responsible I could
[39:27] do everything for you what if I drop
[39:30] that
[39:31] tomorrow you have no way of anxing your
[39:33] money so um I want people to learn and
[39:38] maybe this is why I've had so little
[39:39] success is because I insist that people
[39:41] do the work
[39:42] themselves yeah and this is important I
[39:45] think it was alesandro deani who was my
[39:48] first guest actually and he said people
[39:51] should not have a valid opinion on
[39:52] bitcoin if they did not spend the time
[39:54] and I think he used the time 250 hours
[39:57] on bitcoin on some money on bitcoin on
[40:00] the history of money people don't do
[40:02] that people are
[40:04] lazy only a really few select people
[40:07] actually do that like 99% of the people
[40:11] don't you're completely long how long
[40:13] did it take you to learn
[40:16] enough and when I I first saw Bitcoin
[40:22] 2017 and I did not learn a lot about it
[40:26] I I was a stock investor had Tesla Apple
[40:29] all the tech stocks had also a little
[40:33] lot of luck because I made with Tesla I
[40:35] think I don't know th% or something was
[40:39] really lucky but I did not put a lot in
[40:42] back then and because I was successful
[40:46] in the stock market people were asking
[40:48] me in 2020 more and more about
[40:50] Bitcoin and I wanted to prove other
[40:54] people wrong that Bitcoin is [ __ ] no I I
[40:57] wanted to prove other people that
[40:58] Bitcoin is [ __ ] like I wanted to find
[41:00] arguments against Bitcoin and in and in
[41:05] in my passionate search for that I like
[41:10] how I did it I was Friday Saturday
[41:12] Sunday I did not had any plans and I was
[41:13] like okay this weekend this is a Bitcoin
[41:16] weekend I want to learn about Bitcoin
[41:18] and why [ __ ] like I really went with
[41:20] that mindset into this weekend and I
[41:22] came out on Sunday and was like oh [ __ ]
[41:25] maybe it is something
[41:26] and I bought on Monday a little bit like
[41:29] 100 EUR to put in and one year later I
[41:32] was all in because each week I learned a
[41:35] little bit more I watch the podcast you
[41:37] were lucky enough to buy in the bare
[41:38] Market of
[41:40] 2018 2018 no no I bought 2020 okay first
[41:45] time so opportunties there as well 2017
[41:48] I heard about it but I needed three
[41:51] years to hear more about it and then I
[41:55] started the research like I needed three
[41:57] years to even begin with the research
[41:59] and three years long I dismissed it
[42:02] completely well I have to I have to say
[42:04] that this was also the most difficult
[42:06] time for Bitcoin in my opinion 2017
[42:08] because um the distractions were insane
[42:13] if you think that 2021 bull market was
[42:17] crazy um it really
[42:19] wasn't so in 2017 we had iOS which we
[42:25] didn't see this time around
[42:28] and the types of games that you saw with
[42:30] coins like Cino Etc
[42:33] were everywhere like in 2017 you could
[42:37] not buy the wrong outc they were going
[42:39] up like
[42:41] crazy all of
[42:43] them it was just totally
[42:47] Bon also the dropped the game later was
[42:52] spectacular very
[42:54] humbling this this is why this
[42:57] this most recent Peak 69k
[43:01] 67k took me by surprise because I
[43:05] remember the 27 market and how everybody
[43:08] was behaving and I looked around I was
[43:10] like okay but where's the bull market
[43:12] where where's the equ is where are the
[43:14] people that are doing all of these
[43:15] stupid things and saying all of this uh
[43:18] Madness and I didn't come across anybody
[43:21] just come around so I was like this is
[43:23] this is nothing this is going to keep
[43:25] going
[43:26] so I didn't expect the Dr to occur when
[43:28] it
[43:30] did oh okay
[43:32] okay what do you think will happen in
[43:35] the next few Cycles like you saw the
[43:37] last 10 years uh do you see any patterns
[43:40] that come in every poll cycle and what
[43:43] do you think will eventually happen uh
[43:46] in the next I don't know five years 10
[43:48] years obviously you don't know the
[43:50] future either but what do you think
[43:53] could happen so difficult because
[43:58] the path didn't play out the way I
[44:00] thought it would either at least not
[44:03] exactly I think we're going to go higher
[44:05] for
[44:07] longer what they say but um in in in in
[44:12] seriousness I think we're going to see
[44:14] more of the same right you're going to
[44:15] see more more craziness more spikes more
[44:20] drops but I think they are becoming uh
[44:23] less intense in both directions we've
[44:26] seen that already the market is
[44:28] definitely growing up on that font as
[44:30] regards to volatility but also on the
[44:31] regulation side they're now really
[44:35] taking some people behind the wooded um
[44:39] you can see that withf and with CZ and
[44:42] with with Machin sky and people like
[44:45] that they're trying to clean up at least
[44:47] the the biggest braders in the
[44:50] space and I think they will continue to
[44:53] do that and I think in this regard also
[44:56] they are putting a lot of people on
[44:57] notice because the the the scams that
[44:59] we've seen they were just completely
[45:01] crazy I don't know have you do you know
[45:03] about
[45:05] quria no just on a little side note that
[45:09] was an exchange from
[45:10] Canada the founder had all of the the
[45:14] keys to all of his funds in his
[45:17] head traveled to traveled to India and
[45:20] died oh
[45:24] okay so uh um I don't think they ever
[45:27] got to the bottom of
[45:28] that and you had a lot of shinanigans
[45:30] like that happen in 2017 that was or
[45:34] 2019 I think we saw the what was
[45:38] it there was some scam C from China that
[45:43] pumped Bitcoin up to 13k and then
[45:45] crashed it and I think those people are
[45:47] doing time now in in their
[45:50] jails and
[45:53] so you see a lot of scams in the all
[45:56] Market but I think they're going to
[45:58] they're getting a lot they're catching a
[46:00] lot of them my fear is that they're
[46:02] going to go after the developers of of
[46:06] unimited tools as well and that will
[46:09] push everything
[46:11] underground and make people do what I do
[46:14] just stay
[46:16] Anonymous what's your thoughts on KC on
[46:20] uh buying Bitcoin peer to-peer versus
[46:23] buying Bitcoin on uh Bitcoin changes
[46:26] well I think kyc is just a tool for
[46:31] control it has nothing to do with the St
[46:34] intent because when you think about what
[46:37] money is money is a way to send tax or
[46:44] communicate value without having to know
[46:46] who the other person
[46:49] is and so kyc defeats the whole purpose
[46:52] and I think the more we do that the
[46:54] less well our our our economy is going
[46:58] to function I don't think it's worth it
[47:00] I don't think there's that many bad
[47:01] access out there to to do all of that
[47:03] because just the amount of work it puts
[47:06] on everybody's back it's just insane and
[47:09] increasing and it's it's probably by
[47:13] Design it's probably intended to to make
[47:15] it so that g becomes more and more
[47:18] cumbersome and
[47:20] difficult and use less
[47:23] often and they different kind kind of KC
[47:26] there like KC's where you only have the
[47:29] iban like light KC there's KC where you
[47:32] have to register with video ID there is
[47:35] KC even where you have to prove where
[47:38] the reserves and the money is coming
[47:40] from um do you make a differentiation
[47:43] between those
[47:45] KC's or is it as long as it tied to one
[47:48] person it does not matter uh what KC
[47:52] type of it
[47:54] is I think the more kyc the the worse
[47:58] and it also um it's also a big problem
[48:01] let's say you are very wealthy and you
[48:04] have a lot of your money in Bitcoin and
[48:06] then you have to K YC and then somebody
[48:09] breaches a database or the employees at
[48:11] that company I mean somebody can just
[48:12] apply there and work there and they can
[48:14] see the database and they can figure out
[48:16] where you live because of the kyc they
[48:18] know exactly what you did and that's a
[48:21] huge problem so you don't want
[48:24] that I think we've just seen it in India
[48:27] they had this huge breach in one of
[48:29] their databases where like where where
[48:32] financial data of a billion people were
[48:34] Leed or something like I mean that's
[48:35] that's
[48:37] crazy they're going to do it
[48:39] anyway because they want to control and
[48:41] they have the cuis think that they can
[48:42] Safeguard the data when in fact they can
[48:45] this is what I like about Bitcoin is
[48:47] that there's no place to put that
[48:48] information which just isn't relevant
[48:50] it's not being collected uh it's a great
[48:53] Point um I would
[48:56] um end this podcast with maybe because
[49:00] you said you're also into um gold in the
[49:04] history of it you are well educated on
[49:07] the financial markets where do you see
[49:10] besides from Bitcoin the whole financial
[49:14] um markets going is is uh where where do
[49:18] you see the prediction on the
[49:21] micro or like what is what what are the
[49:24] micro outlooks right now for
[49:28] you I
[49:30] think I think we're at a very critical
[49:33] point right now because we're in the
[49:35] middle of a banking crisis that is not
[49:37] being talked about in
[49:39] us because Bank stocks have stopped
[49:42] crashing people think that it's fine but
[49:45] it's not interest rates have gone up a
[49:47] lot and that pushed down the value of
[49:49] the fonds that these banks have been
[49:53] forced to buy a lot
[49:56] right now they can
[49:58] still swap
[50:00] them at least in the United States they
[50:02] can swap
[50:05] their their bonds for par which means if
[50:08] if they have a bond that's worth half as
[50:10] much as it was when they bought it they
[50:12] can basically give it to the Federal
[50:14] Reserve for
[50:16] year and get the cost that they
[50:21] originally paid for it even though it
[50:22] isn't worth that much
[50:24] anymore
[50:28] and that is still going on and I think
[50:30] it will end in
[50:33] March
[50:35] and that's when I expect them to either
[50:40] come up with some new strategy new
[50:44] funding program or whatever to save the
[50:47] bank because if they don't they're all
[50:49] got class again because you have to
[50:52] think about what's Happening Here the
[50:54] customers
[50:55] have beg taking their deposits out of
[50:58] these
[50:59] bands and putting them into bigger
[51:02] bands where they feel like their money
[51:05] is paper and they can do this
[51:06] electronically these days so a lot of
[51:08] the smaller banks have had to use this
[51:11] facility and they parked
[51:14] their their treasuries that are worth a
[51:16] lot less now at the Federal Reserve and
[51:18] they got passed for it but there's a
[51:20] limit to how long they can do that at
[51:21] least with the current situation as far
[51:23] as I'm aware from by March
[51:28] big big changes because you can see
[51:30] reserves being drwn down in the repo
[51:34] market and everything points to to Mar
[51:38] has been a potentially interesting time
[51:42] of the year again as we've seen last
[51:44] March where we saw the bank crash I
[51:47] think we're going to see something
[51:48] interesting this time and I think this
[51:51] time they might not be caught as much
[51:52] off
[51:54] guard than you know the politicians
[51:56] they're are bureaucrats so I wouldn't
[51:58] put it past them should be surprised
[52:00] once
[52:02] again so so I
[52:06] think the market has begun pricing in
[52:08] rate cuts which might be the reason that
[52:10] things are going up right
[52:13] now and I I definitely don't think we're
[52:15] going to get out of this without another
[52:17] blue eye and that would
[52:20] be doing you a big disservice to say
[52:22] that bitco can't BR because it can and
[52:24] it has and it will again and I think
[52:27] that if you're in this for the long haul
[52:29] you have to be prepared for that first
[52:31] and foremost
[52:32] mentally and secondly maybe with some
[52:35] dry powder in case it does happen I
[52:37] don't think the drop will be as bad as
[52:38] the most when it
[52:40] drop but it could
[52:43] be and if it is we might not go straight
[52:47] back up like we did last time taking s
[52:50] is the solution we have a outin at the
[52:53] podcast where the previous guest asked
[52:56] the next guest a question and you can
[52:58] interpret the question however you you
[53:01] want to interpret it and what does
[53:03] Bitcoin success look like to you what
[53:07] does Bitcoin success look like to me
[53:09] freedom freedom for the maximum number
[53:12] of people I would say because right now
[53:15] we have a lot of
[53:17] people like we did in ancient Rome who
[53:20] don't produce anything who just live off
[53:22] of everybody's hard labor rent stickers
[53:26] there will be the
[53:28] politicians the political Quest Spector
[53:30] and the RIS of and we just have to get
[53:35] those Lees off our
[53:37] back and then we can be free again and
[53:39] then we can exoy the the gains in
[53:42] technology and productivity I think this
[53:44] is when when Humanity will finally see
[53:47] Gold N again this is what Freedom one
[53:52] bring because right now they're just cre
[53:55] all of this currency to pay half the
[53:57] population to be lazy and not work and
[53:59] the other half has to pay for it or less
[54:02] and then they can also fight Wars and
[54:04] Destroy countries with that money and
[54:07] and because most people don't realize
[54:09] this is what's happening and don't know
[54:11] how to resist that it continues but I
[54:15] think it will stop when the Music Stops
[54:17] when when the currency itself that is
[54:19] used
[54:21] to to perpetrate all of that when that
[54:25] stops having value and this is I think
[54:29] something that we don't have to do
[54:30] anything to make this happen they are
[54:32] doing this all
[54:33] by but we don't have to get caught in
[54:35] the clock for I think that's a great
[54:38] point to to end the podcast here uh
[54:41] thank you for doing it Dorian
[54:43] and bye-bye thank you
[54:48] bye-bye
