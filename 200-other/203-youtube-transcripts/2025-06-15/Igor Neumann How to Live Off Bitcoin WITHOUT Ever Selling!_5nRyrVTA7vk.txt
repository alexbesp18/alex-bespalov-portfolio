[00:00] you're actually building a trojan horse
[00:02] and the the institutions and the
[00:03] governments are bringing the value of
[00:06] what Bitcoin really stands for to wider
[00:08] public without even sort of knowing it
[00:10] we're looking at Bitcoin not only as a
[00:12] peer-to-peer sort of transactional tool
[00:14] we're looking really at it as a great
[00:16] asset these concept that are really sort
[00:17] of predominantly leveraged by
[00:19] institutions by banks by uh super
[00:22] wealthy people thanks to Bitcoin now
[00:24] this is accessible to to regular folk if
[00:27] you're short Fiat and long Bitcoin
[00:30] that's a good strategy we actually
[00:31] looking at Bitcoin as your own private
[00:33] bank you can pay with Bitcoin you can
[00:35] pledge as a collateral against your loan
[00:38] it gives you freedom of transacting
[00:40] never sell your Bitcoin but it doesn't
[00:41] mean never use your Bitcoin trust me bro
[00:43] model is a little tricky when you give
[00:46] someone your Bitcoin they give you money
[00:47] against it this is actually the strategy
[00:49] that all the high net worth individuals
[00:51] and companies are doing they keep on
[00:53] rolling the loans uh for the future they
[00:55] never repay that under standard
[00:57] conditions you would need to pay an
[00:58] income tax that's something obviously
[01:00] people want to avoid and that's exactly
[01:02] why smart people never sell their great
[01:05] [Music]
[01:09] assets how do you like that there are
[01:12] now politicians the bitf the big
[01:14] corporations coming in it kind of feels
[01:16] like the the starting of of of Bitcoin
[01:20] the Grassroots movement the cyberpunk
[01:22] movements um from the outside I had one
[01:25] interesting conversation in Amsterdam
[01:27] with a guyy who serves for lles okay and
[01:31] he was like asking me oh what do you do
[01:33] here and I was like oh I'm a Bitcoin
[01:34] conference and he's like but didn't get
[01:37] that get bought by black rock
[01:40] is isn't bitco now Black Rock thing I'm
[01:44] like yes they bought Bitcoin but but
[01:48] only in only at the S they're not owning
[01:51] the network now so I think a lot of
[01:53] people have that feeling of like oh now
[01:55] big institutions are here and they're
[01:57] co-opted now what do you think about
[01:59] that I mean it's an interesting one like
[02:02] personally I really don't care right I
[02:04] mean to me you know Bitcoin is going to
[02:06] be always Bitcoin it's built on on
[02:08] foundations that you can't destroy it
[02:10] doesn't matter whether a government is
[02:12] interested in Bitcoin or not whether
[02:13] institutions or corporations are
[02:15] interested in Bitcoin or not I I don't
[02:18] think the the fundamentals of Bitcoin
[02:20] would change right and that's that's
[02:21] important for for the I wouldn't say the
[02:23] industry but for Bitcoin itself for the
[02:25] community and for for the future of
[02:27] Bitcoin in the first place the on flip
[02:30] side obviously it does bring bring a
[02:32] couple of challenges right I mean
[02:33] Bitcoin that really used to be the the
[02:36] cipher Punk sort of technology or or a
[02:39] you know tool for for anonymity and and
[02:42] you know transactions and peer-to-peer
[02:44] and all that uh and suddenly you've got
[02:46] all the politicians and institutions and
[02:48] and big entities looking into it uh
[02:51] which might really bring um attention of
[02:53] the government attention of you know
[02:55] people that you not necessarily wanted
[02:57] to have in the in the community in the
[02:59] first place
[03:00] but at the same time I feel that it
[03:02] might actually help with the adoption
[03:04] right because I think some of the
[03:05] challenges that we had uh in the last
[03:08] couple of years were that Bitcoin was
[03:10] really perceived as as something almost
[03:12] illegal you know Bitcoin was always
[03:14] connected with like yeah that's money
[03:16] laundering tool that's something that
[03:17] the terrorists use uh this and that and
[03:20] uh once suddenly you have uh big
[03:22] entities like black Ro actually
[03:24] investing in it and people are looking
[03:26] at okay okay maybe so it's not really a
[03:27] terrorist financing vehicle it's
[03:30] actually a legitimate investment tool
[03:32] something that I shouldn't be afraid of
[03:35] right so I think uh Love It Or Not uh
[03:38] this might actually help with the with
[03:40] the sort of spreading the the Bitcoin um
[03:42] um philosophy and um The Narrative uh
[03:46] around Bitcoin much faster in the normi
[03:48] community I would say than if it was
[03:50] still sort of undercover underground you
[03:52] know the Grassroots movement and all
[03:53] that so it it is a it is a a very
[03:56] specific thing but um you know I don't
[03:59] care is a set I don't think it's going
[04:01] to impact Bitcoin the fundamentals of
[04:03] Bitcoin as they are uh at the same time
[04:06] it might really help with with uh The
[04:09] Wider population of people looking at
[04:10] Bitcoin not through the lines of the
[04:12] negative perception that it used to have
[04:13] before it's so you are saying that it's
[04:17] more of a a trojan horse into Wall
[04:20] Street troan horse into this
[04:21] institutions they want to make money
[04:23] with it but they actually introduce a
[04:25] freedom technology absolutely absolutely
[04:27] that's the thing right so and that's you
[04:29] you touched touched on a very important
[04:31] point it's the freedom right so yes you
[04:33] buy an ETF you're not necessarily buying
[04:35] Bitcoin itself uh you're not actually uh
[04:39] leveraging the fundamentals of of
[04:41] Bitcoin and the the freedom element
[04:42] which is super important and that's you
[04:44] know the really one of the foundations
[04:46] of Bitcoin uh but uh uh you are as you
[04:50] said it's it's a very good uh sort of uh
[04:53] leeway to what what what is what is
[04:56] happening that you're actually building
[04:57] a trojan horse and the the institutions
[05:00] and the governments are
[05:02] indirectly um bringing the value of what
[05:05] bit Bitcoin really stands for to wider
[05:08] public without even sort of knowing it
[05:10] or or or kind of considering that
[05:12] they're actually bringing not just the
[05:13] technology they're not bringing just an
[05:15] investment vehicle but they are bringing
[05:18] all the other elements of Bitcoin that
[05:20] are very important that are the
[05:21] foundation of it and uh I think yeah uh
[05:25] naturally and that was also my path
[05:27] partially uh how I got into Bitcoin I
[05:29] mean a lot of people are looking at it
[05:31] as a as an investment vehicle or a
[05:33] commodity almost something that where
[05:35] you can make money on and these these
[05:37] things um but eventually once you start
[05:41] using Bitcoin once you start learning a
[05:43] little more it's inevitable that you're
[05:46] going to fall into the rabbit hole and
[05:47] then you start realizing that oh my God
[05:50] it is not just an investment it's not
[05:51] not just an asset there's so much more
[05:54] um below that so for what it's worth I
[05:57] do think that this might be actually a
[05:58] good thing for Bitcoin it's super it's
[06:01] also for me um when we talk about this
[06:03] institutions we we kind of have to also
[06:05] talk about M saor especially with
[06:07] borrowing I think he he he lives that
[06:09] that that's the that's a sailor way of
[06:11] life like having a lot of assets and he
[06:14] talks about that uh so much this like
[06:17] once you get like that real estate in
[06:18] Manhattan like hundreds of years ago you
[06:21] don't want to sell it you just like
[06:24] Finance it and then you get can live off
[06:26] it the rest of your life that's kind of
[06:28] the idea behind you building right oh
[06:31] absolutely I think this it's the same
[06:32] mindset that we have uh in Firefish
[06:35] about you know what is bitcoin right so
[06:38] we're looking at Bitcoin not only as a
[06:39] as a as a peer-to-peer sort of
[06:41] transactional tool or or money sound
[06:44] money uh we're looking really at it as a
[06:47] as an asset as a great asset and in
[06:49] finance in general as as Michael S is
[06:51] saying uh you know you just don't sell
[06:52] great assets if you if you inherit a
[06:56] painting of Picasso from a grandma if
[06:58] you're lucky enough
[07:00] uh obviously you you can keep on looking
[07:02] at at Picasso you can sell it but we
[07:04] know that you know the value of Picasso
[07:06] would would be appreciating over time so
[07:09] uh what do you do with good assets right
[07:10] so in traditional Finance uh the concept
[07:13] of collateralization meaning or that's
[07:16] basically the process where you kind of
[07:18] pledge your asset against a loan and
[07:20] then use the loan against whatever
[07:22] whatever financing needs you have is a
[07:24] is a very very standard way of uh of of
[07:27] running business or or working with your
[07:29] assets and what I really love about
[07:32] Bitcoin is that uh these concept that
[07:34] are really sort of predominantly uh
[07:36] leveraged by institutions by banks by uh
[07:39] super wealthy people thanks to Bitcoin
[07:42] now this is accessible to to regular
[07:44] folk right so uh I mean even if you have
[07:47] some stocks or Bonds in your portfolio
[07:49] well good luck trying collateralizing
[07:50] them you know your broker would be
[07:51] looking at you and you know it's not
[07:53] easy it's uh uh it's costly at times and
[07:56] all that but with Bitcoin you don't have
[07:58] to care right anyone can have Bitcoin
[08:00] even a fraction of it and you can
[08:02] immediately start using it as an asset
[08:04] right and good assets you never sell
[08:06] them you you live over them right that's
[08:08] that's the whole whole concept of uh or
[08:10] the philosophy basically behind Firefish
[08:13] it's super interesting um for um when we
[08:16] look at in Bitcoin uh and the hardcore
[08:20] bitcoiners who are really all in Bitcoin
[08:22] like I for example I'm all in Bitcoin
[08:24] there are really I think three
[08:26] strategies that I discovered of being
[08:28] all in Bitcoin but still being Fe bills
[08:32] the first one obviously is is Firefish
[08:35] uh lending borrowing against your
[08:37] Bitcoin uh the second one for me is that
[08:39] was I actually right now do uh I have a
[08:43] credit line on my normal bank account of
[08:45] like
[08:46] 10,000 uh and I try always to achieve
[08:49] zero balance on my bank account so
[08:52] sometimes oh like there's an surprise
[08:54] expenses th000 or 2,000 in the negative
[08:58] uh then I just wait till feeld money
[09:00] comes in uh and a pay off uh that that
[09:03] thing luckily or not luckily I have some
[09:08] uh re sources of income that I just
[09:10] cannot change to bitcoin my sponsors pay
[09:13] me Bitcoin not all of them but most of
[09:15] them but for example YouTube ad revenue
[09:18] or Twitter ad Revenue that that's never
[09:20] not anytime soon coming into Bitcoin so
[09:23] that's a great strategy for me just
[09:24] paying off that uh and that was the
[09:27] first the second one and the third one
[09:29] is actually super interesting also one
[09:31] uh spend and replace just like spend
[09:33] your Bitcoin and replace them um maybe
[09:36] let's compare those three a little bit
[09:39] uh or is there is is there fourth one is
[09:41] there something else that you also can
[09:42] do to have maximum exposure to bitcoin
[09:45] uh but still have fat bill to pay I
[09:49] think look the bottom line is first and
[09:51] foremost we we still live in the fat
[09:53] economy right so we we can't avoid uh
[09:56] you know working with Fiat uh I mean
[09:59] there are some efforts in terms of
[10:01] payments in terms of kind of really
[10:03] living the Bitcoin life um but
[10:06] obviously it's at this stage of the
[10:08] development of the the society or of the
[10:11] world uh it's it's really difficult to
[10:13] avoid fat right so and we know that
[10:15] field money is losing value I mean
[10:18] you've heard it on your podcast for you
[10:19] know 300 times at least people are say
[10:22] that you know field is losing money so
[10:24] the a sound strategy in uh in in be in
[10:27] traditional Finance or in general is
[10:30] what we called being short of a an asset
[10:33] or or a commodity that is losing value
[10:36] and being long an asset that is
[10:39] appreciating in the value right so so
[10:42] that's also the philosophy about credit
[10:44] so uh if you are short Fiat and long
[10:47] Bitcoin that's a good strategy because
[10:50] uh in in in time basically your good
[10:52] assets are appreciating the value
[10:54] whereas the the Bad Assets that you're
[10:56] short that you're kind of owning to
[10:58] someone uh is is losing value value so
[11:02] so uh that's why I think um and and you
[11:05] know it's it's a very interesting
[11:06] actually Concept in terms of credit in
[11:07] general as you said like you know having
[11:09] a credit line uh many people do it
[11:11] companies do it uh but there's
[11:13] especially maybe uh I would say I'm from
[11:16] originally from Slovakia and and uh you
[11:19] know taking credit was always something
[11:21] like uh you are either super poor or you
[11:24] have really some financial troubles when
[11:26] you have to take credit maximum what you
[11:28] could do is kind of um get a mortgage
[11:31] but at the same time you know people
[11:33] would perceive oh that's so dangerous
[11:34] and all that so really the perception
[11:35] about credit is like you don't want to
[11:37] be you know you don't want to owe money
[11:39] to anyone right so for historical reason
[11:41] a cultural reason I would say people
[11:43] were always trying to avoid um uh credit
[11:46] but I think there's a really big
[11:48] misconception I mean as I said uh yes
[11:50] owning money if you're in distress uh
[11:53] you you might find yourself in
[11:54] situations when you're not able to repay
[11:56] and then you're falling into the into
[11:58] the debt whole and all that that that's
[12:00] really very very dangerous but if you
[12:03] have a a a strong asset if you have a an
[12:06] asset that is really appreciating and
[12:07] you're pledging that asset against a a
[12:09] credit line that's that's a perfect
[12:12] scenario because you always know that
[12:13] there's something backing you up so
[12:15] that's why we also in Firefish we
[12:16] actually looking at Bitcoin as your own
[12:18] private bank right so you can pay with
[12:20] Bitcoin you can pledge the as a
[12:23] collateral against your loan it gives
[12:25] you freedom freedom for you know freedom
[12:27] of transacting and all that I have Alo a
[12:29] personal actually experience with uh
[12:31] using Bitcoin as a way of getting out of
[12:33] a particle field system maybe we we can
[12:35] get get lat into it but back to your
[12:38] your your question about the strategies
[12:40] um definitely I think you know there's
[12:43] always the there there are these wars uh
[12:45] between hodlers and sort of non hodlers
[12:48] like hey you shouldn't be just holding
[12:49] your Bitcoin and you know we also kind
[12:51] of have a statement saying never never
[12:53] sell your Bitcoin but it doesn't mean
[12:54] never use your Bitcoin right never
[12:56] selling your Bitcoin meaning that you
[12:58] still keep your asset
[12:59] if you're paying with Bitcoin absolutely
[13:01] uh the great strategy is to to buy buy
[13:04] the same amount of Bitcoin back right so
[13:06] again shorting your Fiat you know
[13:07] getting your getting your Bitcoin back
[13:08] which is which is absolutely sound and
[13:11] using Bitcoin as a as a credit line I
[13:14] think that's exactly uh where what what
[13:16] the future holds right so once people
[13:18] start understanding that there are uh
[13:21] secure and safe and legitimate ways of
[13:23] using Bitcoin as a collateral without
[13:25] you being sort of scared of of someone
[13:28] disappearing with your Bitcoin uh and
[13:31] I'm talking about C some of the
[13:32] custodian models and and you know we
[13:34] we've seen a lot of bankruptcies in the
[13:36] in the last couple of years where people
[13:37] lost their Bitcoins and all that so once
[13:40] this is this is set up then I think
[13:41] people will start realizing that
[13:43] actually it is good to be short feed it
[13:45] does make sense uh to take credit and uh
[13:47] you know stick to your Bitcoin which
[13:49] we'll appreciate in the future um and be
[13:51] short uh of the money that uh is is
[13:55] losing value you know year over year so
[13:57] uh we fully support it and as I
[13:59] mentioned I think it really depends on
[14:02] whether you're using a an approach in
[14:04] terms of uh kind of getting the credit
[14:07] uh and uh an approach where your Bitcoin
[14:09] is actually still yours right so we're
[14:12] talking about the non-custodial models
[14:14] versus sort of custodian models where
[14:16] and and I'm not saying all the
[14:17] custodians are are are bad but we've
[14:19] seen many examples where really your
[14:21] Bitcoin has disappeared and you know
[14:23] there's no way back with uh this this is
[14:25] maybe the disadvantage in a way with uh
[14:28] vitco compared to traditional uh
[14:30] financial instruments like a um a bond
[14:33] or a security uh no one can really steal
[14:37] your your stocks right so there are
[14:39] somewhere and you can reverse a
[14:40] particular theft or particular trade
[14:42] whereas with with with Bitcoin if you
[14:44] send your Bitcoin somewhere else then
[14:45] you know good luck getting getting it
[14:47] back so the what we call the trust me
[14:48] bro model is little little tricky when
[14:51] you kind of give someone your Bitcoin
[14:53] they give you money uh against it uh
[14:56] what if they disappear you know then you
[14:58] know you you you you've lost your asset
[15:00] basically so I think it will it will
[15:02] take some time and also in in general
[15:04] actually when we are looking in um into
[15:07] the state of the play in terms of the
[15:08] market in terms of Bitcoin
[15:10] collateralization um only a fraction of
[15:12] Bitcoin is is used as a collateral uh
[15:15] it's getting more and more uh as a as a
[15:18] kind of market Standard but uh when we
[15:21] were doing the analysis only like two to
[15:23] four maybe 5% of Bitcoin was used as a
[15:26] collateral and why was that because
[15:28] we've got Celsius we had def5 block five
[15:31] sorry we had Genesis and some other some
[15:33] some other examples where people were
[15:34] like all right okay these guys were
[15:36] pretending that they were Banks and they
[15:38] actually you know were not really
[15:41] regulated Banks they U disappeared with
[15:43] your Bitcoin and all that so that that
[15:45] has to be fixed yeah it's I think
[15:47] there's a lot of damage uh that has been
[15:50] made block fire and all those those and
[15:53] there were like 30 5050 bankruptcies
[15:56] like that's just like the big ones like
[15:59] effect actually exactly exactly so once
[16:00] once the trouble started I mean and you
[16:03] that's that's the risk of re hypc you
[16:05] know you uh you get a you get a loan for
[16:08] a better better interest rate let's say
[16:10] on a custodial manner what happens to
[16:12] your Bitcoin well the bank is then kind
[16:14] of lending it to someone else right
[16:16] short sellers other institutions and all
[16:18] that because they have it on your bance
[16:20] on their balance sheet and they can do
[16:22] whatever they want once the trouble
[16:24] happens once the hedge fund goes down
[16:25] then it's a domino effect and it goes
[16:27] through the through the whole ecosystem
[16:28] and would like getting your Bitcoin back
[16:31] yeah that's that's that's super
[16:32] interesting when you look at the the
[16:34] history um what are the things that you
[16:37] have implemented that this cannot happen
[16:40] like what uh do even like don't even
[16:42] make the brand of like oh like you can
[16:44] trust me but like not not even having
[16:47] the trust uh fire fish yeah I guess the
[16:51] the bottom line is as I mentioned I mean
[16:52] there are basically two okay there are
[16:54] three models there are sort of market
[16:57] Standard I would say right one is the
[16:59] custodial model where you send your
[17:01] Bitcoin to a uh lender they send you
[17:04] money you repay a loan and then send
[17:06] your they send your Bitcoin back
[17:08] hopefully um then the other model uh
[17:11] which we are absolutely not big fans of
[17:13] is uh wrapping your Bitcoin into some
[17:16] you know uh esoteric networks and and
[17:19] getting loans in stable coins or some
[17:20] other tokens so basically leveraging the
[17:23] defi ecosystem for for borrowing and
[17:25] lending that really brings a lot of lot
[17:27] of challenges I would say and I I don't
[17:29] think people are really aware of all the
[17:31] risks that these these networks these
[17:33] additional layers and wrapping and
[17:34] bridging uh really bring I mean they
[17:36] they just see a nice diagram like yes
[17:37] and your Bitcoin here a federation will
[17:40] issue a token and you know you're going
[17:42] to get your stable coin I wouldn't do
[17:43] that and then there's a third model
[17:45] which is which is uh basically the model
[17:47] we've uh uh sort of we are we've been
[17:49] trying to to leverage which is the
[17:51] non-custodial model and noncustodial
[17:53] model meaning means that you're not
[17:55] actually sending your Bitcoin to a to an
[17:57] entity to some institution to the lender
[18:00] you are locking it actually in a uh in a
[18:03] you could call it a smart contract even
[18:05] though we we still haven't found a
[18:07] better better name for that it has
[18:09] little negative connotation from
[18:11] from from defi but basically you're
[18:14] locking your uh Bitcoin directly on
[18:17] blockchain layer one you're not sending
[18:19] it to some other network or anything
[18:21] like that and what is important is that
[18:24] uh no one has a no one has control of
[18:27] your Bitcoin right so the script that
[18:29] we've developed is actually limiting the
[18:31] way the Bitcoin can be moved Bitcoin can
[18:33] be moved from that escrow where you're
[18:35] looking at only either back to you once
[18:38] you repay a loan or to a liquidator in
[18:40] case you default on your loan right so
[18:42] you don't you don't uh send the money
[18:43] back uh to the to the lender then
[18:46] Bitcoin is moved to Liquidator so they
[18:48] liquidate it they sell it in the market
[18:50] and repay or repay the investor or the
[18:52] order the lender so non custo M way
[18:56] basically means that uh your Bitcoins
[18:59] still remain yours even though you
[19:01] obviously cannot transact with it but it
[19:03] it is not held by anyone else and the
[19:06] way uh Bitcoin can be moved is limited
[19:09] and you have a full transparency on how
[19:12] and when uh this Bitcoin can be moved so
[19:14] that that's that's the bottom line of
[19:16] the technology obviously we we haven't
[19:18] we haven't uh developed any any new I
[19:21] would say technology or any new sort of
[19:23] um protocol uh in terms of you know new
[19:27] new new scripting uh um approach is
[19:29] we're literally leveraging what Bitcoin
[19:31] knows for many many years multi
[19:34] contracts uh pre pre-signed transactions
[19:37] time logs we just kind of mix them in a
[19:39] in a in a smart way uh so these are
[19:42] these are uh approaches or or
[19:43] Technologies I would say that Bitcoin
[19:45] wases forever so it's nothing new
[19:47] they're battle battle tested and
[19:49] obviously transparent open source and
[19:51] all that I imagine there are probably
[19:53] some people that maybe don't know what
[19:56] escro means or don't know even what
[19:58] multi uh I try the best to to keep it as
[20:02] beginner friendly as possible so maybe
[20:04] you can give like a layman terms uh
[20:06] explanation um how this uh technology
[20:10] works and and uh how does this look when
[20:13] I don't know there's a liquidation
[20:15] coming in or when this ends or something
[20:17] like that yeah so really in simple terms
[20:20] you can you can imagine an escrow which
[20:23] is um you know basically where your
[20:25] Bitcoin sits uh on blockchain it's it's
[20:27] it's an address it's an address where
[20:29] you send your Bitcoin and that address
[20:32] has uh particular conditions when it can
[20:35] be when it can be spent or when it can
[20:37] be used right so escrow literally is
[20:39] like something like a mini mini Vault
[20:41] mini treasure where you put your Bitcoin
[20:43] and it can be open only in two ways so
[20:46] there there's a there's a as I said a
[20:48] limit on when the Bitcoin can be
[20:50] withdrawn from the treasure uh the first
[20:53] thing and this is what where you as the
[20:55] borrower come into play in the first
[20:57] place just at the beginning of of the of
[20:59] the of the contract you are signing a a
[21:02] transa you are signing transactions or
[21:04] you're actually agreeing with what can
[21:06] happen to your Bitcoin so the first
[21:07] thing what can happen is that you repay
[21:09] a loan then your Bitcoin is moved back
[21:11] to you the second thing that can happen
[21:13] is that you uh defaulted you can't repay
[21:16] your loan you don't have the money so
[21:18] your Bitcoin has to be liquidated
[21:19] liquidation is literally just a process
[21:21] when Bitcoin moves to to someone else
[21:23] who sells is in the market and Returns
[21:25] the money to the to the lender so
[21:27] imagine I'm the borrower you're the
[21:29] lender I lock my Bitcoin you send me
[21:31] 10,000 right and in one year if I don't
[21:34] repay the €10,000 Euros with interest
[21:36] back to you my Bitcoin would be moved
[21:38] either to you as a liquidator so you can
[21:40] send sell it in the market or do
[21:42] whatever you want with it or to someone
[21:43] else who sells it and gives you Returns
[21:45] the money back to you right so there uh
[21:48] there are only three three things that
[21:49] can happen so first is repayment what we
[21:51] call repayment the second one is default
[21:53] and the third thing which is I think
[21:54] very important is a price liquidation
[21:57] because as We Know you know Bitcoin is
[21:59] volatile right so the value of your
[22:01] Bitcoin today 65 you know yesterday it
[22:03] was 60 so we need to protect uh the
[22:06] lenders from from the volatility that's
[22:08] why when you normally take take a loan
[22:11] um you are pledging twice the amount of
[22:13] Bitcoin so if you want to if you want to
[22:16] or I want to borrow 10,000 from you I
[22:19] have to deposit or lock 20,000 worth of
[22:22] my Bitcoin right so because if the
[22:23] Bitcoin price goes down so imagine I
[22:25] would deposit 10,000 worth of bitcoin
[22:28] Bitcoin goes goes down let's say 10% so
[22:30] now I'm like okay there's 9,000 worth of
[22:33] bitcoin and I have €1,000 so I don't
[22:34] have to repay the loan right so I made
[22:36] money actually right so that's why you
[22:37] need to pledge more Bitcoin than uh than
[22:39] the actual loan and in case uh the price
[22:42] of Bitcoin goes down you still have the
[22:44] cushion right so kind of uh you still
[22:47] have like almost 50% of the potential
[22:49] downside or the potential move to the to
[22:52] to to downside in order to get
[22:54] liquidated so in case uh Bitcoin really
[22:57] Falls 50 60% whatever again it would be
[23:00] moved from the treasure or From the
[23:02] Vault it would get liquidated and you as
[23:04] the lender you would get your money back
[23:06] so that's that's how we're limiting
[23:08] actually what can happen to to bitcoin
[23:11] uh and if it comes down too much uh
[23:14] there's the event where you can post
[23:16] more Bitcoin absolutely absolutely so
[23:18] you can you obviously you would get a
[23:20] notification like hey Bitcoin went down
[23:22] I don't know 20% 30% so maybe you should
[23:24] consider either topping up more
[23:26] collateral meaning sending more Bitcoin
[23:28] so again you're going back with the
[23:30] cushion or you can actually repay the
[23:32] loan right so you would say like I don't
[23:33] have enough Bitcoin but I've got cash so
[23:35] okay I want to close my loan prematurely
[23:37] and that's what you can do obviously as
[23:39] well is there also the other way around
[23:42] where I don't know you made the loan all
[23:44] of the sudden Bitcoin shoots up 10x uh
[23:46] can you then take some Bitcoin from the
[23:48] collateral out uh and then uh make the
[23:52] other way around that that's definitely
[23:55] something that uh people would
[23:56] appreciate because actually when we
[23:58] started Firefish you know Bitcoin was
[23:59] around
[24:00] 15,000 now it's 65 so imagine you would
[24:03] lock your Bitcoin two years ago and now
[24:05] you know you've got like I've got too
[24:06] much Bitcoin as a collateral uh that's a
[24:09] this is a feature we're working on we
[24:11] want to launch it very soon because uh
[24:13] yeah we've seen the volatility we've
[24:15] seen that Bitcoin is really increasing
[24:16] in price and especially if you have a a
[24:17] longer Term Loan I mean if it's three
[24:19] months fair enough but if it's a year
[24:21] year and a half two years and Bitcoin
[24:23] really goes to 100K uh you don't you
[24:26] don't need to have that that much of the
[24:27] collateral so so it is a very it is the
[24:30] fact that we've built it on on
[24:31] blockchain is actually limiting us in a
[24:33] way but there are ways of how to deal
[24:35] with it so for example I think the way
[24:37] we're going to go uh forward is that for
[24:39] example if Bitcoin goes up let's say 10%
[24:41] you can take the 10% back uh back to you
[24:43] and all that so uh at this point in time
[24:46] because we really wanted to launch it
[24:47] you know in the plain vanilla sort of
[24:49] mode so that it works uh people can
[24:51] start using it uh but now we're going to
[24:53] be adding all these things so this what
[24:55] we call Access collateral withdrawal is
[24:57] a feature that we will definitely want
[24:59] to embed a really cool now I think it's
[25:02] very important especially for for people
[25:04] who who want to do that um what's kind
[25:06] of like what do you recommend of like
[25:09] how much Bitcoin you have to get have to
[25:11] to even get started with that when does
[25:13] it make sense uh who should not do it
[25:15] who should do it uh and all those like
[25:18] more personal finance related questions
[25:20] yeah well maybe maybe before that one
[25:22] one thing that I would clarify as well
[25:24] is that the platform itself is actually
[25:26] peer-to-peer marketplace right so you
[25:28] have borrowers so those are bitcoiners
[25:31] who want who have Bitcoin and want to
[25:33] borrow borrow Fiat and then you have
[25:35] lenders who are people who have uh you
[25:37] know Fiat Euros you know other so what
[25:40] we're doing actually on the on the
[25:42] platform is is matching these two sides
[25:44] so me for example if I'm a borrower and
[25:46] I want to borrow 10,000 I go to the
[25:48] platform and I'm going to send a post an
[25:50] order like hey I want to borrow 10,000
[25:52] for let's say one year at maximum I
[25:55] don't know 8% right so I'm going to post
[25:57] it into the platform and then investors
[25:59] get a notification like hey there's a
[26:00] new order are you interested or not uh
[26:03] and they can just click and take it so
[26:04] we are literally then just uh kind of
[26:06] matching two two people and then they do
[26:08] the bank transfer between themselves so
[26:10] it's it's pure uh peer-to-peer uh sort
[26:14] of system so uh the benefit of it is
[26:17] actually what I would say uh that in
[26:19] this case we are helping bitcoiners with
[26:22] uh with their um kind of funding needs
[26:25] so if I if I have Bitcoin like yourself
[26:27] and you need to uh buy a new car or you
[26:29] you want to buy more Bitcoin for example
[26:31] uh we're helping you to to to get this
[26:33] funding but we're also indirectly
[26:35] helping um uh or Bitcoin is actually
[26:38] helping the lenders uh with protecting
[26:41] their Investments right so my mom for
[26:44] example she's using our platform she's
[26:45] got some some spare cash and I I told
[26:48] her like don't leave it in the bank for
[26:50] zero or 2% put it on the platform where
[26:52] the interest rate rates are much higher
[26:54] you don't have to kind of be worried
[26:56] about default or you know any anything
[26:59] else because there's automated
[27:00] liquidation process so if the guy who
[27:03] you who you lend money to doesn't repay
[27:06] the loan Bitcoin will get liquidated and
[27:08] you're going to get your money back so
[27:09] my mom even without not being Bitcoin
[27:12] native she doesn't have any wallet
[27:13] Bitcoin is already helping her or she's
[27:15] using in Bitcoin indirect indirectly in
[27:18] this space which is I think also
[27:20] partially helping with the overall
[27:21] adoption of of Bitcoin that people are
[27:23] realizing like okay it's not just some
[27:26] you know geeky technology but it's
[27:28] actually an asset it's it's a collateral
[27:30] that is you know if you build a build it
[27:32] in a particular way can help you to to
[27:35] achieve your uh uh Financial financial
[27:37] goals right uh and again coming back to
[27:39] your question well um I I I would
[27:43] recommend I mean the we do have certain
[27:45] limits on the on the platform in terms
[27:46] of the minimum minimum ticket size which
[27:48] is
[27:49] 500 uh which is really kind of kind of
[27:52] small so for people to to really just
[27:53] try it and you know test it with with a
[27:55] smaller amount so for500 you would need
[27:57] to have 1,000 worth of 1,000 EUR worth
[28:00] of bitcoin um but obviously I wouldn't I
[28:03] wouldn't recommend people to use all of
[28:06] their Bitcoin that they have to take a
[28:08] loan right so if I have one Bitcoin now
[28:10] with
[28:11] $65,000 I wouldn't take a loan uh you
[28:14] know that's half of it so 32 and a half
[28:16] thousand because exactly what if bitcoin
[28:19] price starts going down I wouldn't have
[28:21] spare Bitcoin to top up my collateral
[28:23] and I put potentially risk a liquidation
[28:26] right so take part of your Bitcoin it's
[28:28] always like you know also with money I
[28:29] mean don't uh or with investments in
[28:32] general just don't kind of go nuts and
[28:36] and put all your eggs into one basket
[28:38] right you always like even if you have
[28:40] Investments you do have some spare cash
[28:42] you know for for the the rain rain day
[28:45] rainy day fund let's say if something
[28:47] happens you know and you need
[28:48] immediately something uh use the use a a
[28:51] a pragmatic approach just consider if
[28:54] you're taking a loan don't use all your
[28:57] Bitcoin just keep Bitcoin on the side
[28:59] and then uh in in case really the
[29:01] Bitcoin price would be going going down
[29:03] you can you can use it to to top up the
[29:05] collateral so just don't stretch
[29:06] yourself be be reasonable that's the
[29:08] strategy and the other thing is actually
[29:10] sorry for jumping in again uh is that uh
[29:13] you could then potentially use the
[29:14] additional Bitcoin to to roll over the
[29:16] loan right so be before the loan matures
[29:19] you and you do not have the cash you can
[29:21] actually use the addition the other
[29:22] Bitcoin that you haven't used to take
[29:24] another loan and repay the the previous
[29:26] loan and this is actually the strategy
[29:27] that all the high net worth individuals
[29:30] and companies are doing they keep on
[29:31] rolling the loans for the future they
[29:34] never repay them so that's that's very
[29:36] important element to consider as well I
[29:38] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[29:41] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[29:44] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[29:47] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[29:49] vigilante made a perfect Bitcoin watch
[29:53] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[29:56] go out there and show that you are a
[29:58] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[30:01] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[30:04] dropped a completely new and amazing
[30:07] Genesis edition of their watch
[30:10] collections you have the date of the
[30:12] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[30:15] and of course also the block height and
[30:18] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[30:21] level of detail they put in in this
[30:24] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[30:26] those amazing coins Vil the time pieces
[30:29] down in the descriptions I love those
[30:32] watches so so much if you watch or
[30:35] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[30:37] I'll guess you already bought some
[30:40] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[30:42] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[30:46] in a hardware wallet my personal
[30:47] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[30:49] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[30:52] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[30:54] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[30:57] exchange change and you can get a 5%
[31:00] discount with the code Robin at the
[31:02] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss Robin to
[31:07] get your bitbox and the next step is to
[31:09] really level up your sovereignty as an
[31:12] individual you have to have the most
[31:14] secure self custody setup you have to
[31:17] secure your own devices you have to
[31:20] protect your privacy you have to set up
[31:23] an inheritance plan and depending on
[31:25] where you live you even want to have a
[31:27] plan and be a citizenship where you can
[31:30] move in case something goes really
[31:32] really wrong and through all those steps
[31:34] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[31:36] step by step and if you visit the
[31:39] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[31:43] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[31:46] out how you can level up your
[31:48] sovereignty wait how how does this work
[31:50] with rolling over you uh let's say we we
[31:53] take out a loan for 10,000 you put like
[31:56] uh uh 20,000 is in there and then after
[32:00] let's say 2 years Bitcoin is up I don't
[32:03] know 70% or something like that how can
[32:04] you roll it over what do you have to do
[32:06] for that so I mean the the easiest
[32:09] approach is basically let's say I I take
[32:10] a loan for one year and uh in one year I
[32:13] have to send you back 10,000 right so
[32:16] instead of instead of uh kind of now
[32:19] selling my Bitcoin or or you know
[32:20] finding the money somewhere I would take
[32:23] another loan again for 10,000 for
[32:25] another year before the maturity of the
[32:27] first loan right so let's say this one
[32:29] uh ends in December so I'm going to take
[32:31] another loan in November and I'm going
[32:33] to use the money to repay the previous
[32:35] loan and I'm going to get my collateral
[32:37] my Bitcoin back so you always kind of
[32:39] keep on rolling it uh This Way year over
[32:41] year two years over you know two years
[32:43] in time and all that so that's that's
[32:45] that's the approach and the best thing
[32:47] would then be if then the price goes up
[32:49] and absolutely you can even take even
[32:51] more exactly exactly and and that's
[32:53] that's the bottom line I mean one one
[32:54] thing we haven't touched on as well is
[32:56] that if you actually sell your Bitcoin
[33:00] uh under under standard conditions you
[33:02] would need to pay an income tax right so
[33:05] that's something obviously people want
[33:07] to avoid and that's exactly why smart
[33:09] people never sell their great assets
[33:12] that's why they keep their assets that's
[33:14] why they're using them as a collateral
[33:15] against the loan and they're using the
[33:17] FIA that is losing the value um to to
[33:20] repay uh to to basically invest or to do
[33:23] whatever they want with it and they just
[33:25] keep on rolling those loans in at
[33:27] infinite basically and you can even
[33:30] write off the interest rates in some
[33:31] cases probably right as as tax benefits
[33:33] oh absolutely I mean again depends maybe
[33:35] on the jurisdiction uh but uh that's
[33:38] exactly you could consider it as a cost
[33:40] of running business and you can kind of
[33:42] decrease your uh tax uh leverage yeah
[33:47] super interesting when the feature is
[33:48] also there where when the price runs up
[33:50] and you can get your Bitcoin out with
[33:52] that Bitcoin you get a new loan and
[33:54] that's a that's super interesting yeah
[33:56] uh it's also interesting uh I think just
[33:58] from uh education standpoint just like
[34:02] let's say someone has uh right now one
[34:05] Bitcoin uh he can just go ahead in your
[34:08] platform and try it out with like 1,000
[34:10] EUR of worth of of Bitcoin uh just like
[34:14] uh just like see what what the platform
[34:16] is all about how this things work and
[34:17] let's let's try it for like one two
[34:19] years uh and then maybe uh he can level
[34:22] up also like the education game in the
[34:24] financial uh game which also interesting
[34:27] uh uh there was one I have an end
[34:30] routine where the previous guest is
[34:31] asking a question for the next guest and
[34:34] the one of the last question my one of
[34:36] my last favorite questions was what is
[34:38] your identity be uh next to being a
[34:40] bitcoiner because I think Bitcoin at
[34:42] some point will be extremely boring
[34:44] because because we have built all the
[34:46] ecosystem Bitcoin is such a big system
[34:49] already uh and that's that's super
[34:52] interesting you think about okay what
[34:53] what are you doing outside of of of just
[34:55] having Bitcoin I think then we have to
[34:57] also learn about uh Personal Finance in
[34:59] general uh living up the income game and
[35:02] all the other things maybe just a quick
[35:04] side question here for you what do you
[35:06] think what what is your identity next to
[35:09] being a
[35:10] bitcoiner oh that's a tough one actually
[35:12] I I never thought of me and I don't know
[35:14] who who put the question I need to speak
[35:16] to them but uh uh my
[35:19] identity I think look like when it comes
[35:22] to bitcoin I I wouldn't maybe mix it
[35:24] with Bitcoin because really uh Bitcoin
[35:27] to me is it is about freedom and it's
[35:30] about learning and growing and and you
[35:33] know opening your opening your mindset
[35:35] uh to new things to new ideas to to
[35:38] Concepts that you maybe considered given
[35:41] or concepts that you were never aware of
[35:44] I mean the concept of of let's say
[35:46] freedom we we think we live in a sort of
[35:48] a freedom Society uh unless you're
[35:51] you're in a in a situation where you
[35:53] realize that actually I'm not as free
[35:56] right there's not not as much
[35:58] Freedom or not as much Freedom as I as I
[36:00] sort of expected so uh that that to me
[36:03] is Bitcoin but in terms of who I would
[36:06] be I think I think I would I would say
[36:09] that I'm a learner really because and
[36:12] this is the thing that fascinates
[36:14] fascinates me on on bitcoin is that uh
[36:17] once you fall into the rabbit hole and I
[36:18] can I can actually tell because I I I
[36:20] see exactly how my life was before the
[36:23] before Bitcoin I would say and after
[36:25] Bitcoin uh that you really it blows your
[36:28] mind to an extent that you are like okay
[36:30] whatever I knew before you know I I I
[36:33] can ignore now I really need to learn
[36:35] and start rethinking from scratch what
[36:38] are the core pillars of Life what are
[36:40] the core pillars of being a good person
[36:42] what are the core core pillars of of uh
[36:45] freedom and and Liberty and all these
[36:48] other uh Concepts right so I'm a I would
[36:53] say that I'm a learner
[36:55] because it's sometimes I feel like I'm a
[36:57] this sponge that you throw into water
[36:59] like I'm trying to absorb so much uh
[37:02] sometimes you get frustrated that uh oh
[37:04] my God there's you know you just turn a
[37:06] page and you're like oh my God there's
[37:08] one billion other other things that I I
[37:10] could learn so uh but that's the beauty
[37:13] of it and I I think uh this drives the
[37:16] progress I remember myself being in a
[37:18] comfort zone and I think this is a big
[37:19] problem uh in general with uh with
[37:21] people that you know we we have a
[37:24] tendency to fall into Comfort zones to
[37:26] become conservative in our opinions I I
[37:29] see on my friends God bless them I I
[37:31] help them I guys uh but uh very often
[37:34] you you see that they they have uh I
[37:37] think also it comes with age that you
[37:39] have your Your World Views you have your
[37:41] ways of doing things and you are less
[37:44] and less receptive in terms of new ideas
[37:46] new approaches new new things and I and
[37:49] when I met when I really dived into
[37:51] Bitcoin all this was was smashed all
[37:54] this was ruined and destroyed and I'm
[37:56] like oh Jesus
[37:57] okay let's open the mind uh let's learn
[38:01] new things and speaking to people the
[38:03] other the other beautiful elements of of
[38:05] of Bitcoin is the community the people
[38:07] that you meet um I used to work in in
[38:10] traditional Finance before of course you
[38:11] meet a lot of lot of smart people but uh
[38:15] Bitcoin is not just the technology it's
[38:17] really culture it's uh it has uh you
[38:20] know it touches so many elements of
[38:23] society so many elements of who we are
[38:25] as individuals for whatever cliche my
[38:27] song uh that really blew my mind and uh
[38:31] that that's why I would say that that's
[38:33] that's the other thing that I feel like
[38:34] I am you know I I I really want to learn
[38:36] as much as I can and and give it away as
[38:39] well I mean uh the orange peeling
[38:41] sometimes again might look like yeah
[38:43] well you are just the sect that just
[38:44] trying to kind of push push your
[38:46] ideology to someone else uh but actually
[38:50] then you learn that even it's it's
[38:52] trying to uh help other people to learn
[38:55] new things to open up their minds to be
[38:57] be more flexible to be more receptive to
[39:00] uh uh appreciate what is what is uh
[39:03] freedom and all that and I think that's
[39:04] the beauty of of Bitcoin that really
[39:07] brings you brings you all these things
[39:09] really cool what have you learned uh so
[39:11] far by being in Bitcoin and especially
[39:14] also with like founding Firefish and
[39:17] doing that platform that is right now
[39:19] like in the in the starting phase what
[39:21] I've learned I mean there's one gazan
[39:23] things of the I would say that I've
[39:25] learned uh I've learned that I really
[39:28] have to be um I have to open my mind I
[39:31] have to be as I said like just just try
[39:34] to listen to people try to understand
[39:37] what's going on um of course yes if
[39:40] you're if you're working in traditional
[39:41] business you're dealing with your with
[39:43] your business partners with your clients
[39:45] with your teams and all that so you're
[39:47] always trying to sort of be the good
[39:49] good guy good person and and be a coach
[39:51] and or a mentor or whatever but uh with
[39:54] Bitcoin we've really learned that first
[39:56] of all
[39:57] there's there's maybe more out there
[40:01] than you will be ever able to comprehend
[40:04] in terms of you know the the
[40:05] technological details the the whole
[40:08] movement behind it uh We've also learned
[40:11] that the Bitcoin Community is really
[40:13] unique uh what's also interesting is
[40:15] it's kind of compact right bitcoiners
[40:16] love speaking to each other you've got a
[40:18] lot of communities that are
[40:19] interconnected bitcoiners and and that's
[40:22] coming back to the mindset right I don't
[40:24] think I've met a bitcoiner who would be
[40:26] yes there are the maximalist but even
[40:27] the maximalist you'll get something
[40:30] positive from them and everything is
[40:32] just in the name of progress in terms of
[40:34] in the name of development in in the
[40:36] name of making things better for for
[40:39] mankind I would say right so that's
[40:41] that's really great uh and then yeah
[40:44] then one billion other things uh around
[40:46] running your own running your own
[40:48] company right one one minute you're a
[40:49] lawyer the other minute you're a finance
[40:51] guide and you're uh marketer and all
[40:54] these things um but
[40:57] it's it is great fun doing it and as I
[41:01] said it's a it's a life-changing I would
[41:03] say uh experience I love that a lot
[41:05] really really cool um before we come to
[41:08] the end routine and other questions I
[41:10] want to dive a little bit into something
[41:12] I think that's really important
[41:14] especially if you think about Bitcoin
[41:16] never selling like why never sell uh not
[41:19] because of like other uh strategies of
[41:22] spend and replace or something like that
[41:23] but why is Bitcoin such an amazing uh
[41:27] asset and collateral and what is your
[41:29] like long-term view of it like where do
[41:31] you see Bitcoin in like 10 20 30 years
[41:34] obviously when you never want to sell it
[41:36] uh you probably have a very long Vision
[41:38] especially if you create a platform that
[41:40] which allows never to
[41:42] sell yeah listen I mean this is this is
[41:44] a tricky one right because uh uh
[41:46] especially when we're talking about
[41:47] bitcoin price I mean there are many
[41:50] people who say yeah you know I'm I'm a
[41:53] maxi or I'm a bitcoiner and I don't care
[41:55] about bitcoin price everybody does I
[41:57] mean let's let's be honest right
[41:58] everybody loves Bitcoin going up uh so
[42:02] uh to me I mean I started in traditional
[42:04] Finance I I actually started my career
[42:06] as a as a Trader during the Doom bubble
[42:09] I don't know if you remember that so
[42:11] yeah it's been it's been many years ago
[42:13] and obviously as a Trader the one thing
[42:15] that you that you learn is that the past
[42:18] performance is not telling you anything
[42:20] about the future performance right so uh
[42:22] when I see all those beautiful
[42:24] logarithmic charts of Bitcoin price yeah
[42:26] it's going go for the you know forever
[42:29] up uh the the the trfi sort of mindset
[42:33] in In Me Is Telling Me like okay don't
[42:35] don't listen to them you know um you
[42:38] know how it works you know it goes up
[42:40] until it doesn't so I don't know if it's
[42:42] going to go further up I don't know and
[42:44] actually I don't care to me Bitcoin has
[42:47] uh many other um benefits or it has a
[42:51] utility that I can really leverage
[42:52] without it going to $1 million of course
[42:55] I would be happy if if it goes there
[42:57] uh but I think there are there are other
[42:59] things that we we we should also
[43:01] consider so in terms of kind of the the
[43:03] future I if if we just extrapolate
[43:07] what's been happening in the last let's
[43:08] even five years with Bitcoin I think uh
[43:11] it might really become a a standard
[43:14] something that as you said like in the
[43:16] future no one's going to be calling
[43:17] themsel a bitcoiner because it's like
[43:19] now they calling yourself a guy who
[43:22] loves electricity right because I mean
[43:23] it's it's everywhere and no one cares
[43:26] anymore right
[43:27] so so I think Bitcoin might really get
[43:29] get get to this stage um but honestly uh
[43:34] again coming back from Trading
[43:36] forecasting future is the hardest part
[43:38] yog said uh forecasting especially about
[43:42] future is difficult so I don't know
[43:44] what's going to happen I don't know what
[43:46] would be the price trajectory I don't
[43:48] know if uh if the governments would
[43:50] start kind of pushing hard on on on some
[43:53] some of these themes around self custody
[43:56] and and you know all these other other
[43:59] issues uh to me at this point in time
[44:02] I'm really trying to be here now and and
[44:04] and uh kind of trying to develop
[44:07] something that is useful for bitcoiners
[44:09] and will be useful for bitcoiners in the
[44:12] future if it obviously stays with us I
[44:14] want to I want it to stay with us I
[44:16] don't know if if it will disappear or
[44:19] not um you know I'm justo too too uh too
[44:22] a little educated in terms of technology
[44:25] and all that but I think uh it does have
[44:27] too many great attributes the the you
[44:30] know the element of of peer-to-peer uh
[44:33] the element of privacy an element of
[44:36] basically boundary L transactions and
[44:39] the element of it being an asset which
[44:41] you can really use as a set as a as a as
[44:44] a collateral and having it as your as
[44:46] your private bank from which you can
[44:48] withdraw uh or cover your funding needs
[44:51] so that that's what is important to me
[44:54] uh as I said I don't want to forecast
[44:55] the future but uh you know the
[44:58] logarithmic chart is showing us the
[45:01] way yeah it's interesting cycle there's
[45:04] a new model coming out which which which
[45:07] which then will be broken the
[45:09] next exactly that doesn't make sense
[45:11] really to think about this absolutely
[45:14] but uh maybe a different uh kind of
[45:17] perspective on the same question um when
[45:21] you are in five years or 10 years or 15
[45:24] years on a podcast uh and
[45:27] uh you you would look back on the
[45:29] history that we we have the next 15
[45:31] years how how would you define if
[45:34] Bitcoin was successful or not like how
[45:36] would you define what needs to happen
[45:38] that Bitcoin is successful completely
[45:40] away from the price uh I think a lot of
[45:42] Bitcoin is all like oh yeah when this
[45:45] hits this price this like I'm not a big
[45:47] fan of that but um what role in the
[45:50] world needs Bitcoin to take for you to
[45:53] say oh yeah Bitcoin is actually the
[45:55] success that I F will be in like the
[45:58] next 10 or 20
[46:01] years I would I would say well the the
[46:04] the simplest simplest answer would be
[46:06] that we would not need to talk about
[46:08] Bitcoin anymore right so they would
[46:11] really become such like electricity you
[46:13] know there's there are Bitcoin
[46:14] conferences but I don't think there are
[46:15] conferences of of fans of electricity as
[46:19] because it became such a standard thing
[46:22] in our lives that we do not have to kind
[46:24] of uh discuss it uh discuss it anymore
[46:27] so to me uh if we are in a phase where
[46:31] where we don't have to discuss Bitcoin
[46:34] as as something that needs to change the
[46:36] world or something that can change the
[46:38] world I think that would be that would
[46:40] be the Pinnacle that would be what to me
[46:42] would mean that Bitcoin has been
[46:44] successful uh I think that's that's
[46:47] that's a great line if Bitcoin is
[46:49] successful in 20 years it will be boring
[46:52] exactly exactly that's that's the point
[46:54] that's the point yeah Bitcoin should be
[46:55] boring it's a it solves that fundamental
[46:58] uh problem I have not told that story
[47:00] for a long time on the podcast and I
[47:02] think it's a very good one uh when I
[47:04] first started out with investing I
[47:06] invested with stocks and all those
[47:07] things and I got kind of Lucky with it I
[47:11] kind of knew what I was doing but mostly
[47:13] I was lucky but I was really successful
[47:16] with my luck uh so like family members
[47:19] friends came hey what are you doing
[47:20] there and I really tried to teach them
[47:23] my Frameworks of like picking stocks
[47:26] okay and nobody really wanted to learn I
[47:28] was like I was kind of frustrated I they
[47:30] want don't want to learn that but the
[47:32] thing is they didn't wanted to learn how
[47:34] to pick stocks they wanted to learn how
[47:37] to preserve their financial energy they
[47:40] just wanted to have an vehicle where
[47:41] they're like oh I get financial energy I
[47:44] put it there because I know the euro is
[47:46] not working for me uh it's maybe working
[47:49] for the next week but not for the next
[47:51] 10 years uh so I need a vehicle where to
[47:54] store the financial energy and I think
[47:56] that's exactly Bitcoin and then everyone
[47:58] is using it it's normal like oh yeah put
[48:01] 70 80% of your financial energy in there
[48:03] then with the rest go play with it uh
[48:06] when we get to that stage and Bitcoin is
[48:08] that boring that like the grandma is
[48:10] saying to to the little kids like oh
[48:13] there is some Bitcoin for you save it I
[48:15] think then we're fine absolutely
[48:18] absolutely and also think about it like
[48:19] the the amount of energy we have to we
[48:21] have to proactively spend on just
[48:25] protecting our our
[48:27] you know wealth I would say like uh
[48:30] inflation you know volatility all these
[48:33] crisis and everything you know the money
[48:35] Printing and all that so we are spending
[48:37] a lot of energy us as the recipients at
[48:39] the the end of the of the funnel uh are
[48:42] spending a lot of energy like okay how
[48:43] can I uh preserve my future purchasing
[48:46] capacity right that that that's a
[48:48] imagine we wouldn't have to deal with
[48:50] this imagine it would be granted like
[48:51] yes in the future in 10 years I'm I'm
[48:53] really like looking at what what was
[48:55] happening in in the last cou years after
[48:57] covid you know with the inflation rate I
[48:59] really got concerned I mean I remember
[49:01] many years ago my friends asked like
[49:03] what are you scared most about and I was
[49:05] like most of I was like uh inflation and
[49:08] at that time inflation was like what 01
[49:09] 2% whatever and then it kicked in and
[49:12] I'm like all right so now this really
[49:15] makes big difference right so how you
[49:17] know yes there are investment strategies
[49:19] yes you are you you're trying to
[49:20] diversifying events invest for the
[49:22] future but just the fact that you have
[49:24] to deal with it proactively spend some
[49:26] time on that uh and there are many
[49:28] people who don't right like I said my
[49:30] mom she's like well yeah I've got my
[49:31] money in the bank I was like do you
[49:33] understand that next year you're 100
[49:34] euros will be will be worth 90 you'll be
[49:36] you're not not going to be able to buy
[49:38] as much
[49:40] groceries for for 100 bucks for 100
[49:42] euros as as as this year so so this is
[49:46] this is a thing that bothers me a little
[49:48] um in an utopian society where we
[49:51] wouldn't have to spend our capacity to
[49:54] think about this how to become richer or
[49:56] not even become richer but how to
[49:58] preserve our purchasing capacity for the
[50:00] future that would be great and if
[50:02] Bitcoin can help with that I would be
[50:04] super happy actually H really cool I I
[50:06] feel like the the pain has to grow I
[50:08] think that the the inflation is not high
[50:10] enough for people actually to care it's
[50:12] people are like yeah okay we have a
[50:14] little inflation but it's temporary it's
[50:15] just because of Ukraine war and stuff
[50:17] like that it's like ah it's like you're
[50:20] okay with a small amount being stolen
[50:22] like I like the example of Jeff poofy
[50:25] always brings up like imagine someone is
[50:27] breaking into every year in your house
[50:30] and just takes a small item out like at
[50:32] some point your house will be empty yes
[50:35] yes yes it's a death by 100 steps right
[50:38] so yeah that's just it hurts a little
[50:40] and it hurts a little and then you
[50:41] realize you're dead because you know you
[50:43] bled up but so so that's exactly the
[50:45] point that's exactly the point and you
[50:47] know the funny thing is uh we talk about
[50:50] inflation all the time I mean you see it
[50:51] on TV uh you know the governments are
[50:54] always talking about it this and that
[50:55] but people really don't get it because
[50:57] it's really it's not that painful uh but
[51:00] also at the same time in countries like
[51:02] I don't know Turkey Argentina Zimbabwe
[51:05] in the past I mean there were you know
[51:07] those people really had to adjust they
[51:09] had to kind of get out of the the fat
[51:10] system and try to find a different way
[51:11] of of doing it you you land in Turkey
[51:14] it's full of crypto and then Bitcoin
[51:16] advertising why well because if you have
[51:18] 50% uh inflation and your Li is going
[51:22] you know through the drain then
[51:23] obviously you have to do something about
[51:25] it so uh this is I think the problem
[51:28] with uh with our society and even my my
[51:30] friends uh who are educated who you know
[51:33] do have some at least basic Financial uh
[51:37] knowledge um they kind of don't care
[51:40] because ah 2% all right 3% 5% inflation
[51:43] well I mean it kind of hurts but
[51:45] whatever I mean so I don't know what
[51:47] would have to happen for them to kind of
[51:49] change their mind and and and do
[51:51] something about it but as I said like if
[51:53] there was a future where we wouldn't
[51:55] have to deal with this the printing
[51:57] machine have a have a have an asset have
[52:00] have really sound money literally uh I
[52:03] think we we would be able to spend
[52:05] really lot of energy on some something
[52:06] else and I hope that future comes I hope
[52:09] that we we right be there one last
[52:12] question because I love to ask that
[52:14] question when we get to the point of we
[52:16] have sound money and everyone living on
[52:18] that found money and nobody has to like
[52:22] everyone is on that standard of um we
[52:25] are getting more purchasing power over
[52:27] time what do you think the biggest
[52:29] impact of of that will
[52:31] be I think really it's about leveraging
[52:35] the human potential in areas where which
[52:37] which lead to progress and not just to
[52:39] kind of plugging the holes we are
[52:42] spending too much time too much of our
[52:44] potential too much of our energy and and
[52:47] focus on on fixing things if those
[52:50] things we if those things are not there
[52:53] if if we have sound money we would
[52:56] really be able to spend our potential
[52:58] our energy on building things for for
[53:00] the future generations and that's it's
[53:02] all about that I mean Bitcoin is about
[53:04] energy we are about energy the whole
[53:06] universe is about energy right so why
[53:08] not using the energy towards towards
[53:11] things that will improve us and uh help
[53:13] us help us progress and grow rather than
[53:15] really fixing things that are caused by
[53:18] some silly system of of printing money
[53:20] and that is destroying destroying human
[53:22] life so that would be great absolutely
[53:26] really cool thank you so much um one
[53:28] last question for Firefish what what do
[53:30] you see uh the long-term vision for for
[53:33] Firefish listen I think we we do we we
[53:36] are really trying to deliver something
[53:39] uh that is in a way missing in in in in
[53:41] Bitcoin right and that is really a sound
[53:45] approach towards leveraging your Bitcoin
[53:47] as a collateral and ultimately getting
[53:49] to that uh you know Bitcoin Bitcoin life
[53:52] we would be really happy if we are able
[53:55] to scale uh across the board and bring
[53:58] more bitcoiners who can actually
[54:01] leverage uh these features they their
[54:03] Bitcoin would stay safe they their
[54:05] Bitcoin would stay uh theirs uh and they
[54:09] would be able thanks to all these uh all
[54:12] the all the elements of what the whole
[54:14] Bitcoin ecosystem brings they would be
[54:16] able to leverage their asset leverage
[54:19] the value that is inherently inside of
[54:21] it uh grow progress and it's it's all
[54:24] about that so the more the more we can
[54:26] make the community happy the better for
[54:28] us um if Bitcoin becomes the standard in
[54:33] the future uh and we would have to shut
[54:35] down I would be more than happy to do so
[54:38] right so that would be that would be the
[54:39] okay if we don't if we didn't have to
[54:41] exist I think that would be a happy days
[54:43] for everyone I I love it a lot really
[54:45] cool um and I very much agree with that
[54:48] Vision um one question that every one of
[54:51] my guests gets uh what can we learn from
[54:53] you besides Bitcoin geez um well
[54:57] I don't think anyone knows about it I
[54:58] don't even know my my guys from um from
[55:02] Firefish my team but uh I'm my very
[55:06] famous bedroom drama and based DJ so I
[55:08] can teach you how to DJ Drama base no I
[55:13] used to I mean I I love I really love
[55:15] music uh I I've got a lot of lot of this
[55:18] you know uh gears and technology so
[55:21] really in my in my spare time I I I
[55:23] spend time with music and I have my
[55:25] little music musical podcast you know
[55:27] focusing on drama Bas so I kind of I'm a
[55:29] collector as well so I'm collecting a
[55:31] lot of music and I'm always making you
[55:33] know playlist and stuff like that so if
[55:35] you want to talk about drama base you
[55:37] know feel
[55:38] free um that that's cool I I was uh also
[55:43] drama for like a year but I was not good
[55:46] at I did not had any feeling I'm not a
[55:49] musician unfortunately um we have an
[55:51] endro te in the podcast as I teased
[55:52] before where the previous guest is qu is
[55:54] asking a question for the next guest
[55:56] without knowing who the next guest
[55:57] actually is and the previous guest asked
[56:00] an interesting question um imagine a
[56:02] door let's say see that one um and
[56:04] behind the door is satosi Nakamoto okay
[56:07] um first question would you open you
[56:09] mean Peter top
[56:12] yeah yeah the next podcast
[56:15] guys okay no um would you open that door
[56:18] and then know
[56:21] whoot no definitely not and that's
[56:24] that's what I think what I've learned
[56:25] from Bitcoin as I told you like
[56:26] uh it makes you makes or you get to a
[56:30] phase where you don't care about certain
[56:31] things right and I really don't think I
[56:33] I I should care about if there's a real
[56:35] satosi Nakamoto if if was it a team of
[56:38] people was it one person does it still
[56:40] live um I I would keep the door closed I
[56:43] would say yes obviously we we're very
[56:46] curious as as as uh as humans but uh I
[56:50] think this is this is a part of the
[56:52] Bitcoin mindset that is kind of growing
[56:55] stronger and stronger stronger in my
[56:56] mind so you know don't care about
[56:58] certain things and I wouldn't care about
[57:00] this either I I very much agree with
[57:02] that uh uh one followup question he he
[57:04] was asking if you came to know about who
[57:07] zamoto is um would you tell
[57:11] anyone I don't think so that's the same
[57:14] thing I mean goes back to the uh the
[57:16] thing of not caring about certain things
[57:19] and you know this this piece of
[57:21] information uh wouldn't I I wouldn't
[57:24] find it as it would change anything uh
[57:27] reasonably it wouldn't add any value to
[57:29] anyone I guess it might even cause more
[57:32] harm than than bringing any value so I
[57:35] would just take it eat it and that's it
[57:37] I I love that a lot really cool before I
[57:39] let you go where can people find you
[57:40] where can people reach out to you ask
[57:42] your questions and find all of Firefish
