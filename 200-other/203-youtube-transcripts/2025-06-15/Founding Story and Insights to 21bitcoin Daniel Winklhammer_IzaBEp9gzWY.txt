[00:00] why not make a a Bitcoin only app the
[00:02] idea was one to make it like really
[00:04] really easy for newbi to really get
[00:06] started with the first Bitcoin the first
[00:08] year you were basically unexisting took
[00:11] us almost 2 years before we had like our
[00:13] first trade on the platform there will
[00:15] be so many new business opportunities
[00:18] that we cannot even imagine now over 60%
[00:21] of people are really doing self- custody
[00:23] but we are seeing
[00:25] this you not only are in Bitcoin you
[00:28] also founded a Bitcoin only company um
[00:33] why was Bitcoin so special to you that
[00:35] you even founded a company uh yeah good
[00:38] questions I guess uh it was a long
[00:39] journey for me so uh I heard about
[00:42] Bitcoin the first time in uh 2011 um I
[00:46] was I was still in school um at that
[00:48] time and we had a classmate um who was
[00:52] paying his servers with Bitcoin at this
[00:55] time I think uh he paid like hundreds of
[00:58] Bitcoins every every month um just just
[01:01] for his uh uh running his servers and uh
[01:05] this was my first touch point but I
[01:07] didn't really got into it and uh forgot
[01:11] about it I was very young then and uh I
[01:14] I heard about it uh two years later so
[01:18] uh uh
[01:20] 2013 um I guess uh there was this whole
[01:23] like Sil grow story and uh I I I I I
[01:27] thought it was very interesting that
[01:29] there
[01:30] some like currency on the internet and I
[01:32] thought to myself okay interesting how
[01:35] does this work and um I also downloaded
[01:38] like um a torrent or a Onion Browser and
[01:42] and served like Silk Road and had a look
[01:45] on it but uh yeah I I I tried then I I
[01:50] really tried to buy um like some Bitcoin
[01:53] to just uh see how how it is and but it
[01:57] was really hard so back then I was in v
[02:00] and I joined local Bitcoins uh this was
[02:03] a I think they dis discontinued their
[02:07] service but this was a like a P2P
[02:10] platform where you can meet uh where you
[02:13] can meet like people who are doing um
[02:16] cash for for Bitcoin trades and I
[02:19] thought to myself yeah that's that's
[02:21] like a bit scammy I don't know um how to
[02:24] do it so I I forgot about it uh again
[02:28] and then uh it was uh I think 20177
[02:32] early early in the year uh when Bitcoin
[02:35] uh hit hit the Thousand threshold again
[02:39] and I saw an article online and I
[02:42] thought to myself okay uh this thing
[02:45] Bitcoin is still here and uh the price
[02:48] has gone up dramatically and reached
[02:50] $1,000 again and this was when I really
[02:54] dig into it so so I started to like
[02:57] listening to podcasts uh
[03:00] yeah reading every article that I got
[03:03] and I really F fell down the rabbit hole
[03:05] then and yeah so this was like my my
[03:08] Bitcoin journey and I tried to really
[03:12] orange pill um some of my friends and
[03:14] also some of my family members and some
[03:17] of them uh wanted to buy Bitcoin and
[03:20] there was no really easy way uh to do it
[03:22] in Europe back then so I thought to
[03:25] myself end of
[03:27] 2019 why not make it simple why not um
[03:31] make a a Bitcoin only app so that you
[03:33] don't have these problems like um you
[03:36] you tell someone about Bitcoin they they
[03:38] are ready to buy their first coins and
[03:41] uh then you send them to like an
[03:42] exchange and they come back uh two weeks
[03:45] later and tell you that they have bought
[03:47] Bitcoin cash because uh it was cheaper
[03:50] and it was advertised on this platform
[03:53] and all of this problems and uh yeah so
[03:58] then the idea was spond to make it like
[04:00] really really easy for newbies and also
[04:03] for for beginners to really get started
[04:05] with the first Bitcoin also have no
[04:08] distraction and uh yeah this was uh end
[04:11] of 2019 um one once the the idea for 21
[04:16] Bitcoin has
[04:18] started and how was it to found a
[04:20] Bitcoin company I mean founding a
[04:22] company in itself is a is a hurdle and
[04:25] is a a challenge but what are any
[04:27] special hurdles in running a Bitcoin
[04:31] company inside of the European Union
[04:33] which highly regulated with uh all that
[04:36] uh stuff yeah back then so end of 2019
[04:40] there was no real regulation so um we we
[04:44] started this uh idea and and also like
[04:48] um we did some prototyping when there
[04:51] was no clear regulation so the first
[04:54] regulation that also included Bitcoin
[04:57] and
[04:58] cryptocurrencies um was was back in
[05:00] early 2020 so when the uh Financial or
[05:05] like the anti-money laundering act uh uh
[05:08] with the number five came into um like
[05:11] Austrian law then this was the first
[05:13] time that Bitcoin was really regulated
[05:16] um in in in Europe and also in
[05:18] Austria and uh yeah I can remember uh it
[05:23] was really like uh discussing this uh
[05:26] also with the regulator how should we do
[05:28] it um with which service do we really
[05:30] want to to make uh which laws apply here
[05:34] and it was like really figuring out uh
[05:37] which laws you have to to follow um in
[05:40] the first six months so we didn't really
[05:42] know um how to to um craft the business
[05:46] model so that we have like a regulatory
[05:49] certainty and uh yeah everything was
[05:52] really like in the baby steps uh there
[05:55] and this it was like one it it took us
[05:58] almost one year to really get like the
[06:01] first registration from the financial
[06:03] Market
[06:04] Authority so the first year you were
[06:07] basically nonexisting
[06:10] basically we founded a company uh like
[06:13] uh not not like the company that we have
[06:15] now but um like uh yeah it's called Ein
[06:21] in in in Austria so um yeah you have all
[06:24] the LI liability as a person as a as a
[06:27] natural person there and we just tried
[06:30] to figure it out how to do it and uh
[06:33] which which laws we have to really
[06:35] follow and yeah do it took us really
[06:38] like I would say almost two years before
[06:41] we had like our first trade on the
[06:43] platform so I guess uh this is this is
[06:46] not not the typical startup maybe um and
[06:49] and yeah basically we we came right in
[06:53] that moment when the regulation uh
[06:55] started I think I also saw that uh I
[06:58] think was an article in in the Red Bull
[07:02] magazine the 21 Bitcoin tries to get the
[07:06] MAA license in the beginning of 2025
[07:10] like what is that in the beginning I I
[07:13] myself don't know and I think most
[07:14] people not uh um heavily invested in
[07:19] that and how will it change 21
[07:22] Bitcoin Yeah so basically the regulatory
[07:24] landscape right now is pretty
[07:27] fragmentated uh over over Europe
[07:30] so every country has basically their own
[07:32] rules so if you uh offer a service in
[07:36] Germany for example you have to register
[07:38] with the buffin there that's the
[07:40] regulator that also oversees like Banks
[07:42] and other um Financial companies and in
[07:45] Austria it's called the finance Market
[07:47] off um FMA so and basically every
[07:50] country has uh some kind of of of of
[07:55] general rules but uh they are they are
[07:57] different so if you want to really offer
[08:00] your your service in all of the
[08:02] countries in Europe or even in the
[08:04] European Union you have to go like to
[08:07] every regulator in every country and
[08:10] register um a license there basically
[08:13] which is like really time consuming um
[08:16] also from a legal perspective you have
[08:18] to have really good um lawyers in each
[08:21] country you have to have like a company
[08:23] in each country so it's basically not
[08:26] doable for for a startup but um this is
[08:29] changing with MAA so MAA is is like a
[08:33] European regulation um this will also be
[08:36] uh like a forn that means that uh it is
[08:41] valid for the whole European Union um so
[08:45] the the individual countries don't have
[08:47] to like make their own rules and and
[08:49] laws to implement it and with that once
[08:52] you um get like the MAA license you can
[08:55] really offer your service in a in a
[08:58] regulated way in uh all of of all of the
[09:01] countries in
[09:03] Europe and to offer it in a regulated
[09:07] way is the must like you have to do it
[09:11] in a regulated way otherwise you running
[09:13] the risk of the business is just getting
[09:17] shut down by The Regulators right yes
[09:21] yeah yeah basically if you want to
[09:23] advertise your uh your service in in one
[09:26] of the countries in the European Union
[09:28] you have to have um this license yeah is
[09:31] are there any effects on the end
[09:33] consumer that are now not implemented in
[09:36] the 21 Bitcoin app that might come in
[09:38] the next uh two three years with that
[09:42] license yeah basically uh maybe for 21
[09:45] Bitcoin customers not so much so we have
[09:48] like a legal setup which is um really
[09:51] solid I guess so we designed um all our
[09:55] from from a technical point and also
[09:57] from a legal standpoint we decided um
[10:00] that we separate customer funds with
[10:03] company funds which is now and must
[10:06] under ma but now you could like
[10:09] commingle it so there's no like law um
[10:12] that you have to to separate it but um
[10:15] we have like done some really really um
[10:19] yeah many many things to to um yeah make
[10:23] it like easier for us to transition to
[10:26] MAA and also which we think is in our
[10:29] best interest for our customers so uh
[10:32] maybe everybody knows like the story of
[10:35] FTX and Celsius and blocky and all of
[10:38] the us-based uh companies there so um
[10:42] they like had no segregation with their
[10:45] funds so they gambled with customer
[10:48] funds uh and and yeah that's not
[10:50] possible with 21 Bitcoin because we have
[10:53] like a trustee agreement with our
[10:55] customers to every Euro uh on on and
[10:59] every Bitcoin or or BTC you have um on
[11:02] our platform is really owned by you so
[11:05] even in the case that we go broke
[11:07] tomorrow all of the assets are are there
[11:10] and um also like separated from from our
[11:14] company funds so I guess this is one big
[11:17] topic um which is also good I think in
[11:20] my opinion um to to have like crypto
[11:23] Services uh to to adhere to that but um
[11:27] for the End customer I guess it's also
[11:29] like uh more transparency you have um to
[11:32] have like guidelines how does the price
[11:35] uh come into into being in on your
[11:39] platform so um there's a lot of like
[11:42] customer focus transparency uh measures
[11:45] that you have um to have also like uh
[11:47] one thing um is is you have Capital
[11:50] requirements you cannot run a crypto
[11:53] business without having like uh a
[11:56] baseline of capital and also that
[11:58] changes with how much money you you um
[12:02] yeah you you work with uh just to make
[12:05] it to make it more safe so I guess a lot
[12:08] of a lot of the regulations here with
[12:11] MAA come come from the learnings that we
[12:14] um had over the the past uh yeah three
[12:16] to four years it's interesting because
[12:19] uh a lot of the regulations are like
[12:22] inside of an Fiat system that is uh
[12:27] somewhat on the opposite side of a
[12:29] Bitcoin system and it's almost like
[12:32] there's like a leak out of the Fiat
[12:34] system and the Fiat system is regulating
[12:37] how how the how the Fiat is is leaking
[12:42] out of that system and going into this
[12:44] new system Bitcoin um for a really
[12:48] long-term VI like I'm talking 50 hundred
[12:52] years um do you see any future where a
[12:55] 21 Bitcoin app service is no longer
[12:59] required because there might be no feat
[13:02] left absolutely so if you if you're
[13:05] talking like over time span of uh more
[13:07] than 10 years or maybe more than 20 or
[13:10] 30 years uh I think all of our money
[13:14] will be digital and and I think Bitcoin
[13:16] is is the only viable solution I hope uh
[13:19] that it goes in this direction um I
[13:22] think we are seeing like the the also
[13:24] like the beginnings of
[13:26] cbdcs uh coming uh there's there's a lot
[13:29] of discussion going on in in Brussels so
[13:32] in Europe for the for the digital Euro
[13:34] but over the long term uh yeah Bitcoin
[13:38] will be like like uh the asset to own
[13:43] and maybe uh it will back some
[13:45] currencies in the future so we are
[13:47] seeing like also the B Beginnings there
[13:50] with El Salvador I think um the Bitcoin
[13:53] bonds are coming into fruition now um or
[13:56] or in the next year um there are also
[13:59] like other countries in the pipeline
[14:01] what what you can like hear on on
[14:04] Twitter and I think this the development
[14:07] is just the beginning so once you really
[14:09] grasp what Bitcoin really is um I think
[14:14] there's no coming back so uh what also
[14:17] we see as a company um from our
[14:19] customers um we see that a lot of people
[14:21] are selling like real estate uh gold uh
[14:26] yeah um um as like stocks and and ETFs
[14:31] to go into Bitcoin and uh it's just the
[14:35] beginning so once once you buy like two
[14:38] or three% of your portfolio in Bitcoin
[14:41] it performs good it becomes a bigger
[14:43] bigger part of your portfolio you become
[14:46] more Comfort uh comfortable comfortable
[14:48] with it and uh I guess it's a oneway
[14:51] street so Bitcoin will grow in in the
[14:55] future I think it will um have some
[14:59] have some uh uh like price swings uh we
[15:03] we will see price swings in in the
[15:05] future too but uh overall it goes uh up
[15:08] in the direction the right direction I
[15:12] guess so when you imagine that kind of
[15:15] uh future where Bitcoin is basically the
[15:19] standard and there are no more people
[15:22] left to on board to to uh to bitcoin uh
[15:26] what do you think can 21 Bitcoin offer
[15:29] like do you have like it's a really
[15:31] long-term thing and as a CEO you might
[15:35] be now concern more like the next five
[15:38] years and there will be like billions of
[15:40] people joining in the next 10 years
[15:43] like the business you are in is
[15:45] basically a really big one but what is
[15:48] after that do you have any imagination
[15:50] What uh Bitcoin exchange and uh can do
[15:54] in that realm in that era yeah yeah I
[15:59] guess it's hard to predict uh what would
[16:01] what will happen really but um I think
[16:03] we all are also seeing like the B
[16:06] beginnings of that with um for example
[16:09] the lightning Network um there are more
[16:11] business models developing over the last
[16:14] year on the on the second layer
[16:16] Technologies um we are seeing like a lot
[16:18] of startups there uh particularly over
[16:22] over in the US um so for example
[16:25] podcasting is is a really nice example
[16:28] um um really going away from the
[16:31] traditional uh model like advertising
[16:35] and have like ads in your podcast to
[16:37] really go um to value for value and
[16:39] streaming like money and uh I guess this
[16:42] is just uh one example there will be so
[16:46] many new business opportunities that we
[16:48] cannot even imagine now and uh yeah
[16:53] everyone if more people have like
[16:56] Bitcoin in their in their wallet and in
[16:58] their possession there will be the need
[17:00] for like you have um uh hire for example
[17:05] so you need to you you maybe want to
[17:07] pass Bitcoin to your um to your kids so
[17:11] there are not many great Solutions out
[17:14] there in Europe uh for for example right
[17:16] now I think this will also be like a
[17:18] really really good and long-term uh uh
[17:21] service that is needed also like how how
[17:24] you can store your Bitcoin so easy multi
[17:27] signature wallets Solutions uh where you
[17:30] can have like one trusted party maybe uh
[17:33] if you if you lose one of your keys uh I
[17:37] think this will also be one one really
[17:39] uh exciting new business model that will
[17:42] pop up over the next years yeah you just
[17:45] mentioned self custody and um I'm quite
[17:49] active with orange building uh everybody
[17:51] I know and I get most of them to buy
[17:55] Bitcoin I get most of them even to buy
[17:57] Bitcoin quite aggressively because they
[18:00] understand it uh but a lot of them don't
[18:05] come to the point that they're actually
[18:07] self-
[18:08] customing and I have a lot of questions
[18:11] about that like first of all um you
[18:13] talked about the hurdles back when you
[18:16] first wanted to buy Bitcoin and it was
[18:19] not easy enough because if it would be
[18:21] easy maybe you would have already bought
[18:24] it really really early on um now it's
[18:27] way easier uh the whole journey um what
[18:30] has to be improved in the whole Bitcoin
[18:33] Journey from I have Euros in my bank
[18:36] account to I have full Bitcoin in self
[18:40] custody um what do you think are the
[18:42] major Catalyst that my grandma also buys
[18:46] it and puts it on their self
[18:49] custody yeah good question maybe just
[18:51] one remark I I think we are also uh we
[18:53] are still very very very early I think
[18:56] if you're are in Bitcoin you you often
[18:59] forget that so uh you live in this
[19:02] bubble where everybody knows everything
[19:04] about Bitcoin and self custody but if
[19:06] you look over that uh not many people as
[19:10] you mentioned uh are are there yet and I
[19:14] think that the greatest hurdles are like
[19:17] uh the tech technicality of it maybe so
[19:21] uh Hardware wallets are really good for
[19:23] storing um for storing Bitcoin like
[19:25] securely but only if you're really
[19:28] understand what you are doing so if you
[19:32] most of the people are not like uh uh
[19:35] they don't they don't have it uh like
[19:37] like others uh or or maybe let's let's
[19:41] let's say it otherwise most of the
[19:43] people uh currently own like or have
[19:47] bank accounts or have like their their
[19:49] trading accounts with with a broker
[19:51] where they have stocks in it and they
[19:54] really know if if they lose their
[19:55] password okay they can call the bank um
[19:59] their bank or their their broker and
[20:02] they will reset the password and they
[20:03] have not lost like their money I think
[20:06] this is also like a a a shift that that
[20:09] needs to happen so with self custody
[20:12] comes a lot of ownership and and um yeah
[20:16] like uh sovereignity but also uh a lot
[20:21] of risks and uh this is quite new I
[20:24] think Bitcoin is is like yeah the first
[20:27] and only asset which you can really
[20:29] really on and uh this will take uh yeah
[20:33] this will take years I guess from a
[20:36] social perspective and also from from
[20:39] like um making it easier so uh if you if
[20:43] you look over over the last 10 years it
[20:46] got a lot a lot easier so like with new
[20:50] inventions like seed phrases where you
[20:52] can really write down uh 12 or 24 words
[20:55] and Abstract the private key key and you
[20:58] don't have to to do like a long list of
[21:01] of of letters and
[21:03] numbers but uh I guess this this really
[21:06] needs to
[21:08] be maybe over the next years uh brought
[21:11] onto a Next Step there are a lot of
[21:13] project out there um they have some good
[21:17] good ideas um how to abstract it maybe
[21:20] with uh for example some uh social uh
[21:23] logins for example so you have your
[21:25] Google account um maybe you can can um
[21:29] yeah abstract it uh in in this way that
[21:32] you don't you can
[21:34] really like like have like a multi
[21:36] signature setup with different accounts
[21:39] or maybe like communities like fatty Min
[21:42] this is a great project but I guess uh
[21:45] this needs uh some some experimentation
[21:47] and some
[21:49] iteration um to make it really easy and
[21:51] and better for for future um Bitcoin
[21:54] holders yeah I also think that like who
[21:58] knew like 20 30 years ago I don't know
[22:02] when email was invented how to send an
[22:04] email uh what's in WhatsApp and when you
[22:08] just look at how fast it went how easy
[22:12] it is now we have the passwords we have
[22:15] two Factor authentification uh everybody
[22:17] knows oh how to reset a password and
[22:20] it's so so easy and if you talk with
[22:25] like a grandma Granddad they're like
[22:27] what pass
[22:29] multifactor it's completely out of their
[22:32] realm and maybe that's a look in the
[22:34] future where managing keys and multi and
[22:38] self- custody will be completely normal
[22:41] uh except maybe like all the people that
[22:44] are just not into it or like need just a
[22:46] longer time frame and I think we we will
[22:49] get there but it just needs a lot of
[22:51] education and L a long time of of yeah
[22:55] trying out new things um invent ing new
[22:58] technologies and onboarding a lot of
[23:00] people and I quite like that like if an
[23:04] exchange does not uh um advocate for
[23:09] self- custody it's a complete red flag
[23:12] for me I I will not touch it like
[23:14] advocating for self- custody that quite
[23:16] like but I still think that a lot of
[23:20] your clients might hold the Bitcoin on
[23:24] uh 21 Bitcoin do you know uh or can you
[23:28] share um I don't know if you can even
[23:30] share that uh percentage how many um of
[23:34] your customers directly go with auto
[23:36] transfer with auto transfer feature do
[23:38] self custody uh and some how many stay
[23:43] or how many are like never transferred
[23:45] any am money out of 21
[23:48] Bitcoin yeah uh I can I can share some
[23:51] general insights there um so I think our
[23:54] customer base is really uh different
[23:57] from from other exchanges I I know some
[24:00] internal stats from other exchanges I
[24:02] won't say names but they have like less
[24:05] than five% of the people buying there uh
[24:08] that really self custody and withdraw
[24:10] their their assets so um I guess this
[24:13] this is really like for for the the
[24:16] crypto user they just want to make money
[24:19] and they they buy for speculation they
[24:21] don't have any like uh incentive to self
[24:25] custody really uh by at 21 Bitcoin is
[24:29] quite different so we have like over 60%
[24:31] of people are really doing uh self
[24:34] custody there like uh either have uh a
[24:37] feature called like Auto wallet transfer
[24:40] where they have when it turned on you
[24:43] set like a threshhold of Bitcoin and
[24:46] once the threshhold is is reached you
[24:48] get an automatic transfer to your
[24:50] Hardware wallet that is uh added to your
[24:52] 21 Bitcoin account and or other people
[24:56] are doing like every for every every buy
[24:58] so for every purchase they're sending to
[25:00] their wallet um you can also use it like
[25:03] really non-custodial 21 Bitcoin we have
[25:06] like one button if you turn it on um the
[25:09] whole experience is non-custodial but
[25:12] our our strategy is um to make it like
[25:15] really easy to buy your first Bitcoin so
[25:18] in in our eyes you don't have to have
[25:22] like a self- custody wallet from the
[25:24] from the minute one when you buy 15 uh
[25:28] Bitcoin because uh it is also like like
[25:30] an hurdle for for a lot of people to
[25:33] really if if you just buy like 15 to
[25:36] really uh get get order like a hardware
[25:40] device which costs more than1 EUR and uh
[25:43] you lose a lot of lot of uh people there
[25:46] and but our strategy is like
[25:48] to uh yeah have have like so so we see
[25:52] 21 Bitcoin like as a partner not just
[25:55] not just the exchange where you buy
[25:57] Bitcoin
[25:58] but you're a partner for the long-term
[26:00] journey journey in Bitcoin and we to we
[26:03] try to educate uh the the the person on
[26:06] his Bitcoin Journey so we have like a
[26:09] lot of uh recommendations in the app um
[26:11] we also plan to make it like Dynamic so
[26:14] for example uh if a if a person buys 50
[26:17] EUR of Bitcoin every uh month and
[26:21] doesn't withdraw it so we have like uh
[26:24] on on on the on the home screen we have
[26:26] some recommendations
[26:28] and specifically for that person we
[26:30] would recommend hey look at uh look at
[26:33] this article very we uh describe self-
[26:36] custody and and non-self custody um we
[26:39] describe what are the advantages what
[26:41] are the disadvantages and then how you
[26:44] can set it up uh with 21 Bitcoin so you
[26:47] really get a t tailored uh approach to
[26:50] your Bitcoin journey and educate educate
[26:54] um people about uh the the advantages
[26:57] and also disadvantages so they feel safe
[27:00] uh doing self- custody I guess this is
[27:02] really really important do you see any
[27:05] effects like to with the more education
[27:10] and maybe also with uh events like okay
[27:13] it was was almost like it feels like it
[27:16] was 10 years ago FDX and Celsius uh but
[27:19] uh did you saw any Trends there that
[27:23] people actually was like oh should uh
[27:26] exchanges are not the best place to keep
[27:28] Bitcoin I should move it over to self
[27:32] custody did you saw in for sure so so we
[27:35] see uh we saw two two Trends uh the
[27:39] first one was like people were staging
[27:41] like mad so price went down and and uh
[27:44] every time price really dips uh people
[27:48] are using uh like the the sa instant
[27:51] rails and send us uh like flood us with
[27:54] with money and uh are really buying the
[27:55] dip and also like in these events um we
[27:58] see a great outflow um of of coins from
[28:02] from 21 Bitcoin which is also really
[28:05] good so um we don't see this like uh as
[28:09] as as we are not like using customer
[28:11] funds like other exchanges for us it's
[28:13] not a problem for us it's a liability if
[28:16] we have a Bitcoin that we have to
[28:18] custody for our uh for our clients so we
[28:21] encourage our business model is to
[28:23] encourage users to withdraw so we that
[28:26] we don't have this liability for example
[28:28] so uh yeah I guess it's it's pretty
[28:31] aligned from from our business model and
[28:33] also uh the users that that we have on
[28:36] 21 Bitcoin yeah if you don't do anything
[28:39] with the Bitcoin from the customers that
[28:41] you don't own of course uh then it's
[28:45] it's uh a work that you're doing for
[28:47] your customers and it's like a liability
[28:50] liability as you said so but with 60% uh
[28:54] with drawing 40% or not like around
[28:57] about that number you still have a lot
[28:59] of Bitcoin I guess um just from a
[29:03] personal point of view I uh struggled a
[29:06] long time how to set up my key
[29:08] management how to set up everything how
[29:11] does this look for like a regulated
[29:13] company for so many uh customers like
[29:18] who who who has the keys without putting
[29:22] a a Target on someone's
[29:24] back yeah B basically so that's that's I
[29:28] guess that's not uh feasible for a
[29:30] startup to really do uh like like this
[29:33] kind of custody themselves so we are
[29:35] using like a technical contractor we
[29:38] using bitgo uh this one of the most
[29:41] known and and securest uh uh yeah
[29:44] custodians in the crypto space uh they
[29:47] also got like uh yeah one month ago I
[29:50] think the buffin registration so which
[29:52] is a really good sign also for Europe
[29:55] and for our clients and and yeah they
[29:58] also have like insurance policies uh 250
[30:01] Millions million dollars they're doing
[30:04] like segregation of wallets uh 100% is
[30:07] in in Cold Storage so I guess this is uh
[30:09] the safest way um that we can offer our
[30:12] our clients but uh of course so um the
[30:17] 40% are not static that are not
[30:19] withdrawing so we we also see like the
[30:22] longer people are with us the more they
[30:25] are withdrawing then or or start to
[30:28] withdraw Bitcoin because they're also in
[30:31] in their Bitcoin Journey um of course
[30:33] not not everybody of them but that
[30:36] that's some uh something we're seeing
[30:38] and which we also actively are
[30:41] promoting and then we have like new bees
[30:44] that are coming to us and and they're
[30:46] start stacking and so like you have this
[30:49] rolling uh 40% uh around that
[30:54] yeah how did you um resist
[30:59] the um let's say seduction of altcoin
[31:04] Casino uh because I guess as an exchange
[31:07] you can make a ton of money just letting
[31:11] people buy and sell every day some uh
[31:15] altcoins and gamble their money I guess
[31:20] I did not look in any numbers but I
[31:22] guess with FDX and all the others we see
[31:25] that the it could be a while
[31:27] business why did you decide to not do it
[31:31] and resist these
[31:32] seductions at the first place it's it's
[31:35] for me personally it's a a Mor morality
[31:38] issue I I would not like to sell uh
[31:42] these kinds of investment scams in my
[31:44] opinion so most most of these coins are
[31:46] really like scams and I could not sleep
[31:49] well uh in the night if if we would sell
[31:52] them and so basically that's that's the
[31:55] first rule and also the way we
[31:58] structured our business and business
[31:59] model is like not um bringing people
[32:03] like to trade a lot but uh to have like
[32:05] long-term relationships and what we are
[32:08] also seeing we have we have done like
[32:10] some comparisons with with coinbase data
[32:13] because um this data is is of course
[32:15] publicly available because they're
[32:18] they're uh listed on the stock exchange
[32:20] and uh we had uh we compared like the
[32:23] numbers um of the average uh transaction
[32:26] size
[32:27] uh that that a active customer makes per
[32:30] month and um I think we have like three
[32:33] or four times higher numbers which
[32:36] really uh say a lot that uh Bitcoin
[32:39] investors are are like more confident in
[32:42] their investment and in their savings uh
[32:45] vehicle and they put more money in which
[32:48] makes us more money so we don't have to
[32:51] like drive people to trade and in and
[32:54] out and in and out uh because they're
[32:57] there are larger sums and also like uh
[33:01] we think our our business relationships
[33:03] with our customers will take longer so
[33:06] most of the crypto um customers uh they
[33:09] they're only doing like in trading in
[33:11] the hype hype phases so when the bull
[33:14] run hits um they they really make a ton
[33:17] of money uh but uh on on the other side
[33:21] uh they they really lose their revenue
[33:23] streams I think I saw like a headline
[33:25] from bit Panda um in Austria they they
[33:28] lost around 80% of the revenue um from
[33:32] 2021 to 21 22 which is quite a lot and
[33:37] and we don't see that we are just
[33:39] growing and when the price dips people
[33:42] are are are buying like M and I guess
[33:45] this is a really great differential of
[33:48] us that's crazy that's really cool um
[33:52] because then you have basically an
[33:54] exchange that is from the business model
[33:56] also set up in a low time preference
[34:00] mode uh which focuses on the long-term
[34:04] business relationship with their clients
[34:08] and you said that the tips like when
[34:11] there are tips that the customer buying
[34:14] way more than usual so I guess tips are
[34:20] the strongest uh strongest times for 21
[34:24] Bitcoin like in financial terms or you
[34:27] see almost no fluctuation
[34:30] like yeah we have like we have like a
[34:33] really great uh Baseline because a lot
[34:36] of customers are doing like the the
[34:38] weekly or monthly uh DCA we have a lot
[34:41] of customers that are also doing like
[34:43] daily um like buying 15 EUR daily or or
[34:47] more um but but we see uh of course we
[34:51] see price swings uh heavily uh uh yeah
[34:55] influence influence the volume
[34:57] so if price spikes or Price goes down we
[35:00] see more inflow and people buying yeah
[35:04] and we don't have like really we don't
[35:06] have any sells so I think our buy side
[35:09] percentage is is around 98% most of the
[35:12] time so uh this this also um
[35:17] yeah shows that we have like long-term
[35:20] uh buyers I saw something unrelated to
[35:24] 21 Bitcoin I saw uh just right before
[35:27] uh the podcast I also checked your uh
[35:31] Google and I saw a LinkedIn of yours
[35:33] also and I saw your CV and you did you
[35:37] studied economics in Austria how far
[35:40] away is that from Austrian economics uh
[35:43] good question yeah it's it's uh you you
[35:45] could imagine that uh if you study
[35:48] economics in Austria that that maybe one
[35:51] lesson is about Austrian economics but I
[35:54] I've never heard about it in in my
[35:56] studies so the first time I I I got into
[35:59] contact with Austrian economics was
[36:01] really when I uh uh fall down the rabbit
[36:05] hold with Bitcoin so there were no like
[36:08] classes of Austrian economics in in
[36:12] Vienna was it was it difficult for you
[36:15] to go down the rabbit hole because you
[36:17] got the you got the teaching from a
[36:21] different kind of Economics
[36:24] perspective yeah I heard that from from
[36:27] other people but um in my personal
[36:29] experience it was not that hard um I
[36:32] think I'm
[36:34] I'm I have been always a very curious
[36:37] person and I did not take everything for
[36:41] granted so um it it was not really hard
[36:44] for me so uh once once I saw like the
[36:49] these mismatches and also these
[36:52] inconsistences uh with the kesian model
[36:55] and and the fat economic
[36:57] um I I yeah I I did not struggle that
[37:02] much I
[37:03] guess when you are in your family or
[37:06] friend Circle or maybe you meet someone
[37:09] at a party that uh are not into Bitcoin
[37:13] H how what core message or what core
[37:17] principle are you giving them about
[37:21] Bitcoin what what message do you want to
[37:23] give them uh with with them on the
[37:28] way yeah uh I I don't talk so much about
[37:32] Bitcoin in my private life um I did that
[37:36] a few years ago so I think everybody uh
[37:40] experiences it when when once they fall
[37:43] into the rabbit hole they they want to
[37:45] like shout it into the world but
[37:48] nowadays I don't talk about it so much
[37:50] in my private life I really try to focus
[37:53] more on the Fiat side so uh if you you
[37:56] talk to people nowadays everybody feels
[37:59] the inflation everybody has like some uh
[38:03] experience that something is not quite
[38:05] right they don't know uh what what
[38:07] really is it um but uh I think this is
[38:11] this is uh yeah the best angle to tackle
[38:15] it and uh yeah a lot of people of course
[38:18] come to me and and ask me about Bitcoin
[38:20] then then
[38:21] it's other conversation because if they
[38:24] have questions I'm I'm I'm open to to
[38:26] answer it but I uh quit like uh pushing
[38:30] Bitcoin to to to everybody so I I really
[38:35] focus on the Fiat side and also on the
[38:37] inflation and uh yeah the outlooks for
[38:40] for the Euro and and yeah I think these
[38:43] topics are really resonate with with a
[38:45] lot of people that's interesting because
[38:48] I also went through this journey and I
[38:51] talked with almost everybody now on the
[38:53] podcast on you're my 12th guest actually
[38:56] uh uh so almost everybody went through
[38:59] that journey of wanting to Orange peill
[39:03] just everybody in the first one to two
[39:05] years uh and then they stepping a little
[39:10] bit back and saying oh actually Bitcoin
[39:13] is also succeeding without me uh if they
[39:16] don't get it uh I don't care to a
[39:18] certain
[39:20] extent uh and I made the like I'm with
[39:24] my clear name Robin as my actual name
[39:28] everybody my family everybody in my
[39:30] friend Circle everybody even at work and
[39:32] Everywhere I Go knows I'm that Bitcoin
[39:37] guy so I don't have to say Bitcoin to
[39:43] people are bringing it up naturally and
[39:47] I'm as you said standing there for
[39:49] questions and trying to put the the the
[39:54] uh conversation in the right light
[39:58] um but sometimes it's hard like
[40:00] sometimes it's when when especially when
[40:02] we talking about the feeld system and
[40:04] inflation and how bad everything is it's
[40:07] sometimes really hard to not bring up
[40:09] Bitcoin it's still sometimes like I just
[40:11] want to shout hey Bitcoin would be good
[40:14] for that I guess but I actually stopped
[40:17] that too it's I think it will come
[40:19] naturally and I start seeing more and
[40:23] more interest in Bitcoin since the start
[40:25] of December
[40:27] also from friends and families also on X
[40:30] I don't know maybe you can talk about
[40:32] that also because you also have an X
[40:34] present personally and with 21 Bitcoin
[40:38] and I it's now the 20th of December
[40:41] where we are
[40:42] recording and usually I get right around
[40:45] a million impressions uh for a month and
[40:49] I have now almost two and a half million
[40:52] impressions for December only I did not
[40:56] do anything quite quite different do you
[40:59] see any uh data from your X Channel or
[41:03] maybe also from
[41:05] the um exchange data you see that
[41:09] December is different uh this time
[41:13] around uh definitely so uh I think all
[41:16] of our measures uh yeah new users like
[41:21] volume like uh website views uh also
[41:25] like um Instagram reach is is is alltime
[41:29] alltime high on an alltime high and uh
[41:33] yeah I guess so interest is really uh
[41:36] bigger now this is also um due to to
[41:40] price I guess so um we pumped Pumped a
[41:43] lot um this year so we have like
[41:46] $44,000 now and yeah we definitely see
[41:50] see that also um on X uh I'm not really
[41:55] that active actually so I have like my
[41:59] uh three days in a month where I like
[42:01] post nonstop and then like leave it for
[42:05] three weeks so um yeah I I need to be
[42:08] more consistent there but I think it's
[42:11] all also really a Time killer I don't
[42:13] know how you how you can manage it with
[42:16] with your job and also like posting
[42:18] there and have like discussions uh most
[42:21] of the time it's really interesting but
[42:23] sometimes you think like uh yeah you you
[42:26] look at it and uh two hours fly away and
[42:29] you thought uh yeah I need to do it this
[42:32] thing now yeah I almost everything I do
[42:36] is
[42:38] scheduled um this is uh one bad thing
[42:42] about it I cannot tag anyone uh this is
[42:45] uh the one thing I still look for for
[42:47] one tool that where I can tag people
[42:50] nicely um in the scheduling app because
[42:55] as you said it's it gets really uh it
[42:57] gets really massive you go on Twitter so
[43:00] many times and you are posting then
[43:02] you're reading then you're answering and
[43:04] it it's a Time killer definitely and I
[43:06] like to do the scheduling because when I
[43:10] schedule all my posts when I go on
[43:12] Twitter I can use it normally and I can
[43:14] interact with the replies I can interact
[43:17] in the uh notifications with the the
[43:20] messages and also on the feed I will
[43:23] look what's what's happening right now
[43:25] it's a thing to to see like I I curated
[43:30] my feed completely Bitcoin only I don't
[43:32] get any altcoins I don't get rarely get
[43:36] anything outside of Bitcoin ill mask
[43:39] posts I always get that's the only thing
[43:41] outside of biton I think and that's it's
[43:44] a it's it's a nice way to catch up with
[43:47] what's going on but it's also a Time
[43:49] kill as you said and scheduling uh I can
[43:52] also recommend that to you uh as as a as
[43:55] a person Daniel um it's amazing how uh
[43:59] great this is if you have um a day in a
[44:02] week where you schedule the the tweets I
[44:05] had is just like if you have three days
[44:07] you can take those tweets and just put
[44:10] it out for three
[44:12] weeks uh yeah it's just just more
[44:15] focused yeah so I like that um I have an
[44:20] Android team but for before the Andro
[44:22] team I would like to ask one uh
[44:25] different question because uh as an
[44:28] founder of a company uh I think you also
[44:33] get approached by newspapers by
[44:35] mainstream media uh outside of the
[44:38] Bitcoin bubble um I guess I don't know
[44:41] if if this is right um how different are
[44:44] my questions from
[44:46] them totally different so uh they have a
[44:49] lot of questions about the uh validity
[44:53] of Bitcoins or is it really a a real
[44:55] invest investment so you're really
[44:57] making money um with like selling
[45:00] Bitcoin um how can you do that and uh
[45:05] yeah you really have like customers that
[45:07] are over 60 so uh yeah so I get I get a
[45:12] lot of questions about uh these these
[45:14] things and uh yeah so they're they're
[45:18] they're different but once you talk with
[45:20] them they really uh you you see like the
[45:23] light bump going on when you talk to
[45:26] them a little bit longer and it's it's
[45:28] really interesting um if uh how how
[45:31] Bitcoin is seen also like by the
[45:33] traditional uh news outlets and how
[45:36] different we are in this
[45:39] space can you share percentage how many
[45:43] people are investing with 21 Bitcoin
[45:45] over
[45:47] 60 is it an is it an amount that's
[45:51] significant or is it just a number
[45:53] that's that's okay there are people in
[45:56] over
[45:57] 60 no I I would say it's it's
[46:00] significant so we have a lot of
[46:01] customers over the age of 45 so I think
[46:05] this is also like our our best group for
[46:09] Revenue if you if you would say it like
[46:11] this and yeah we have we have a lot of
[46:13] people that are quite old like
[46:17] pensioners um but it's really
[46:19] interesting so I guess also the shift
[46:21] comes from there so uh in the Bitcoin
[46:24] space we we all talk about like um how
[46:27] they're giving their wealth to the Next
[46:29] Generation and they will come to bitcoin
[46:31] but we what we are seeing is um that
[46:33] also like a little bit older people are
[46:36] uh getting started or or get get started
[46:39] to to have like an interest in in
[46:41] Bitcoin and have like some percentage of
[46:44] the portfolio um allocated to it it's
[46:48] crazy um we are having an end routine in
[46:52] the podcast where the previous guest
[46:54] asked uh uh the next guest a
[46:58] question uh the previous guest without
[47:01] knowing who's the the actual uh guest
[47:04] the previous guest asked did you notice
[47:06] any patterns from your pre- Bitcoin life
[47:09] that prepared you for your Bitcoin life
[47:14] now good question any any R
[47:18] routines yeah pattern pattern um you can
[47:23] take the question wherever you want uh
[47:25] because because um it does not come from
[47:28] me and you can interpret it as as as you
[47:31] wanted to interpret it yeah I think in
[47:35] the beginning I I already uh said that I
[47:37] was like a really Cur curious person um
[47:41] so from the beginning I I can uh
[47:44] remember when I was just a little kid um
[47:47] we we had a computer at home without any
[47:50] internet and and yeah I every day I I
[47:54] unplugged it and really uh got in yeah
[47:58] put it together and and and yeah did
[48:01] like like so many things with it so
[48:04] because I was so interested and there
[48:06] was no information so I I couldn't get
[48:09] any information what is like a hard
[48:11] drive how does it work and I just
[48:13] unplugged it and and went with the
[48:15] screwdriver and then uh yeah took a look
[48:19] at the parts and the magnets and I
[48:21] erased everything was um was what what
[48:25] was on there
[48:26] and I think this is something which
[48:28] really prepared me for for also like uh
[48:32] grasping Bitcoin and and being curious
[48:35] and and and studying it and really uh go
[48:38] deep in there listening to a lot of
[48:40] podcasts reading a lot of books and
[48:42] articles yeah I guess I would say this
[48:45] this is something which really helped
[48:48] did you also then get into mining or
[48:51] running your own note at some point when
[48:54] you are like in in that computer uh
[48:58] aspect yeah I I ran a lot of uh
[49:01] different notes um I crashed a lot of
[49:04] them so so now I'm running umbrell uh
[49:08] because it's just I don't have any time
[49:11] now to to really do like management of
[49:13] of of nodes but I think I ran every
[49:16] every distribution that is also there
[49:18] like rasby Blitz my umbr all of them uh
[49:22] because I really like it I'm I'm I'm
[49:25] coming from a tech background a little
[49:27] bit um so I I also went into a technical
[49:30] school uh I did some programming there
[49:32] I'm not a good program at all um but but
[49:35] I like to really get into the details
[49:38] and and U yeah look look into systems
[49:41] and uh that's just fun for me yeah
