[00:00] I've allocated every asset that I can
[00:02] into Bitcoin it's a lot easier to learn
[00:04] how Bitcoin Works than to learn how
[00:06] Federal Reserve swaps work I think
[00:08] Bitcoin wins cuz it's a better system
[00:10] it's not centralized it's based on rules
[00:12] not rulers my goal is to live my life
[00:14] with Integrity systems that have clear
[00:17] rules create an opportunity for people
[00:19] to have success I actually do they quit
[00:22] for good my normal job because I wanted
[00:24] to dedicate my full life now to bitcoin
[00:28] they have something that they're
[00:29] passionate about and then they have
[00:30] something they do for money like that's
[00:32] their purpose the real magic happens
[00:34] when you can blend passion and
[00:36] purpose I just want to before we start
[00:39] with Bitcoin and and sat saver and all
[00:43] all this fun stuff um and we talked a
[00:46] little bit about that before and I saw
[00:47] it on your website that you have seven
[00:50] kids and with the eight eight on the way
[00:54] uh and it's it's really fascinating for
[00:56] me to see a lot of bitcoiners being uh
[01:00] that kind of traditional uh having that
[01:03] TR Traditional Values in in their life
[01:06] how do you see like the the connection
[01:08] maybe between Bitcoin and having the
[01:10] traditional value mindset and having
[01:13] kids and doing the stuff you're
[01:16] doing um yeah you know uh I think that
[01:20] people are seeking truth I certain types
[01:24] of people my goal is to live my life
[01:26] with integrity that's kind of like my
[01:28] like kind of fundamental
[01:30] um word I would I would utilize to to
[01:32] describe what what I want to do with my
[01:34] life and I learned that uh through
[01:37] having a larger family you know my heart
[01:40] has really turned towards my family
[01:41] that's probably not you know it sounds a
[01:43] little um emotional but um as I've had
[01:46] more kids like I love my kids more
[01:49] individually and collectively and I
[01:51] really want to build something great
[01:53] with and for them um I don't want to
[01:56] just send them off into the world just
[01:58] to start from Square One um so that's
[02:01] kind of like the functional component of
[02:03] it but why do I want to have a large
[02:05] family man I feel like if you look um
[02:09] historically um people have always
[02:11] cherished their like family their
[02:15] children their offspring they're I mean
[02:17] bloodline might sound a little removed
[02:19] but you know the more children I have
[02:22] the the more I I care for them um the
[02:26] more excited I am about the potential
[02:28] that we have collectively
[02:30] But ultimately that requires me to like
[02:33] live a life of Integrity or I'll just
[02:36] give them you know I want to give my
[02:38] kids tools not baggage so um parenting
[02:41] is more about the growth of the parent
[02:43] than the child and um in my family um
[02:47] I've had to become a better person uh to
[02:50] effectively like serve their needs and
[02:53] lead them uh so I think it's a lot of I
[02:56] think it's seeking truth and and and I
[02:59] think the LIE of of small families or
[03:02] families being too expensive or whatever
[03:05] you know if it matters enough to you
[03:07] you'll make a way but at the end of the
[03:09] day everybody's got their own decision
[03:10] to make about that and I'm not trying to
[03:12] force that because it's a deeply
[03:13] integrated uh idea in society yeah it's
[03:16] fascinating how this modern technology
[03:19] Bitcoin is so tied to this Traditional
[03:21] Values uh of having a lot of kids and
[03:24] having those kind of families but you
[03:26] also uh as you told me right before the
[03:29] podcast fulltime on RV and jumping from
[03:32] Airbnb to Airbnb and that with seven
[03:35] kids soon eight uh that's that's really
[03:39] really really cool it's pretty wild um
[03:42] so um you know we've been full-time
[03:45] rving for about five years we're in an
[03:48] Airbnb right now um but we're about to
[03:50] get back in the RV I just had to make
[03:52] some uh adjustments to it um we've loved
[03:55] it you know we moved out of a 7200 squ
[03:57] foot house with a pool house and you
[04:00] know fancy cars and all that kind of
[04:02] stuff and I just it was kind of you know
[04:05] it was great but it was also kind of
[04:07] meaningless and so uh when we jumped
[04:09] into full-time rving uh man it just
[04:12] brought our family so close together and
[04:15] uh we started when our fifth child his
[04:17] name is Swift when he was two weeks old
[04:20] um and we not not Taylor Swift I have to
[04:23] throw that out there because she's like
[04:24] in the news I'm a Jonathan Swift uh was
[04:29] a was a a kind of old school uh satirist
[04:35] and uh anyways they as the two Swift
[04:38] like Taylor Swift and there's like the
[04:40] Swift banking system yes hey there we go
[04:43] yeah but uh anyways yeah so uh it's it's
[04:47] been awesome you know our kids love it
[04:49] um right now um after this I'll take uh
[04:53] my oldest three boys to uh to football
[04:57] practice um but we do homeschool I mean
[05:00] we do we do all that kind of stuff um
[05:02] you know we try to avoid seed oils we
[05:05] eat a lot of
[05:06] steak and those are things that we kind
[05:08] of came to you know prior to bitcoin to
[05:11] be quite honest I mean they just kind of
[05:14] they're just you you know if you take
[05:15] responsibility for your own life you
[05:17] start to figure figure things out and I
[05:19] think that's one kind of rude thing
[05:20] about Bitcoin is people are tired of
[05:22] trusting other people to do the right
[05:24] thing with their finances um and and
[05:28] with truth if you will we have to kind
[05:30] of make sure that that the decisions
[05:32] that we're making are accurate because
[05:35] there's real consequences if they're not
[05:38] yeah and it's also with the full
[05:40] responsibility I mean you have seven
[05:42] soon eight kids and uh I guess the kids
[05:45] are not producing income at the moment
[05:48] yeah not yet well and so that's the
[05:50] thing too you know we wna i w to I want
[05:53] to get good at being together as a
[05:55] family I feel like that's one of the
[05:57] more I feel like that kind of idea of
[05:59] just like actually developing like a
[06:01] healthy family relationship isn't really
[06:04] focused on a lot um and uh in so doing
[06:08] we can you know we can work through a
[06:11] lot of the issues uh learn to respect
[06:14] each other and hopefully we could do
[06:16] some great things together but yeah you
[06:17] know and so funny enough uh we only have
[06:20] one girl
[06:23] oh that's an interesting rate it is and
[06:27] so the e one is also going to be uh
[06:30] that's a surprise we don't know yet I'm
[06:32] pretty good at reading sonograms though
[06:34] so I know what it is but that that
[06:37] information has not been disclosed to my
[06:39] wife even so okay we'll see how the the
[06:42] rate is going yeah and which I was
[06:46] getting at is like having so many kids
[06:48] uh is like almost having a small company
[06:51] where you have to like make sure to uh
[06:55] be financially responsible to everybody
[06:57] so you don't let anybody down and it's
[07:00] even more hard because in a company you
[07:02] have employees and the employees are
[07:03] producing income they're making
[07:05] something productive a kid till certain
[07:07] age uh is just it's hard to say it like
[07:10] that but it's just eating from it's an
[07:13] investment part you know like you're
[07:14] putting all the you're putting all the
[07:16] resources into building like one of the
[07:20] best assets that you can be a part of
[07:22] right I mean I can't control them they
[07:25] have their free will to do whatever they
[07:27] want to and uh but I just want to show
[07:30] them there's a really great way that we
[07:32] can live together but yeah no I I truly
[07:35] believe that like just like a company
[07:37] with employees the employees are assets
[07:39] of the company you know and I believe
[07:42] that children are assets not liabilities
[07:45] um and so if I expend my time and effort
[07:47] and resources to develop these
[07:51] individuals in the best way nobody cares
[07:54] more about your kids than you do I mean
[07:56] unless you're doing it wrong um but you
[08:00] know my my goal is to really develop um
[08:03] do what I can to to equip my children
[08:05] and like I said I want to give them
[08:06] tools not baggage you know I'm 39 uh I
[08:10] was raised by the government schools and
[08:13] uh I just I know there's a better
[08:15] pathway I want them to to to stand on my
[08:19] shoulders and learn the lessons that
[08:20] I've learned and you know they they
[08:22] obviously have the opportunity to make
[08:24] their own decisions uh later down the
[08:26] line with however whatever path they'd
[08:28] like to take but um their assets and I
[08:30] want to invest my time and energy um
[08:32] building them up so so I guess they are
[08:34] also homeschooled as so many kids from
[08:38] bitcoiners yes of course yeah we've been
[08:41] homeschooling we've actually spoken to a
[08:42] couple homeschooling conferences but um
[08:45] we are uh we've been homeschooling for
[08:48] goodness since our oldest is 13 our
[08:50] youngest is um let's see about 23 months
[08:56] now and we've been homeschooling since
[08:59] my uh oldest was about six years old so
[09:04] and and how do you go ahead and learn
[09:07] the your kids about financial
[09:08] responsibility about Bitcoin uh I mean
[09:11] they are really young though but it's
[09:14] like yeah do do you do something for
[09:17] them even in that young age um so I mean
[09:19] I think a lot of the things that we talk
[09:21] about in Bitcoin are are first
[09:22] principles like what's the foundation of
[09:24] your thought process and why is it like
[09:26] that and so um
[09:30] you know I'll give you an example we
[09:31] were driving in the car yesterday things
[09:33] started getting a little wacky in the
[09:34] car um because if we don't direct that
[09:37] energy in a like a meaningful way way
[09:39] that they can jump on board with then
[09:42] you know things can get a little crazy I
[09:44] got a lot of boys um I actually have a
[09:46] friend that has a lot of girls and and
[09:48] he said in our house everybody screams
[09:51] and is really emotional um and his
[09:54] brother had a lot of boys and he said in
[09:56] my brother's house everything's broken
[09:58] so there's a lot of with with a with a
[10:01] you know a preponderance of
[10:03] boys but we started talking about uh
[10:06] simple machines so we started talking
[10:08] about the screw um The Wedge the lever
[10:11] and the pulley you know we started
[10:14] talking about these different things and
[10:15] and we just started establishing like
[10:17] some fundamental tools that they can use
[10:21] to solve the problems that they face in
[10:23] life right so um and when it comes to
[10:26] when it comes to bitcoin for example um
[10:29] bitcoin's a really
[10:31] beautifully developed system why well we
[10:36] can just look at the free market and the
[10:37] free market says it is um first of all
[10:39] so then we can extrapolate why um is
[10:43] this surviving and a lot of bitcoiners
[10:44] before it survived and thrived analyze
[10:47] those aspects of Bitcoin and realize
[10:49] that Bitcoin um does things better
[10:52] because it's an incentive based system
[10:55] that's just it's based upon clear rules
[11:00] that people can understand um or will be
[11:03] taught you know you run into a wall
[11:05] enough times you'll stop doing that and
[11:07] you'll take a couple steps to the side
[11:09] and pass through the doorway so um I
[11:12] think that's what's going to happen a
[11:14] lot of people are going to have bloody
[11:15] noses before they wake up and realize
[11:17] that they can't just go through uh the
[11:20] wall because there's a door drawn on it
[11:22] they actually have to pass through the
[11:24] path of Le least resistance and that's
[11:25] what Bitcoin has provided you know a
[11:28] path of least resistance for uh that's
[11:31] constructed out of order and clear
[11:33] incentives like I mentioned but if you
[11:36] want
[11:37] to be serious about you know
[11:41] finances um your efforts your energies
[11:45] Etc you're going to have to learn a
[11:48] little something and it's you know it's
[11:49] a lot easier to learn how Bitcoin Works
[11:52] than to learn how Federal Reserve swaps
[11:55] work and and and like that's just not
[11:58] even scratching the surface of of the
[12:01] system that we operate in um so and you
[12:04] know the other thing about Bitcoin is is
[12:07] like I genuinely feel protected within
[12:11] that system because of the clear strong
[12:13] boundaries that it provides you know
[12:15] just imagine driving over a really high
[12:17] bridge that's one lane n9ine foot wide
[12:20] and your your car is eight foot wide you
[12:22] know you would feel a little nervous
[12:24] about it well what if we put some guard
[12:26] rails up well you'd feel a lot more
[12:28] confident and so so um those guardrails
[12:31] um they make the system they reinforce
[12:34] the Integrity of the system but they
[12:36] also reinforce the confidence of those
[12:38] participating in the system so I think
[12:40] it's a it's you know it builds on itself
[12:43] uh in that regard so um there's a you
[12:46] asked a question that was completely
[12:47] unrelated but um I I kind of took a
[12:51] Wandering route to that but man you just
[12:53] talk about real things and uh you know
[12:57] my wife is incredible
[12:59] uh she's she has like um like
[13:03] core um educational content you know
[13:07] that she's curated and and that we found
[13:09] like works really well to teach our kids
[13:10] to read and stuff like that but again
[13:12] you can teach a kid to read but if they
[13:13] don't have a desire to read then you
[13:16] know what's you know it can help them I
[13:18] guess a little bit later down the line
[13:19] or right now it checks the block and
[13:21] makes other parents happy that you're
[13:23] not a bad parent But ultimately what I
[13:25] want to do is I want to teach my kids to
[13:26] read and develop a thirst or hung longer
[13:30] uh to pursue things that interest them
[13:32] and and then also guiding them hey what
[13:34] are the consequences of being interested
[13:36] in X versus what can be the benefits of
[13:39] being interested in why for example so
[13:42] just kind of hopefully putting our
[13:44] energy into them in a in a thoughtful
[13:46] way yeah opportunity cost is a real
[13:48] thing like if you focus your energy on
[13:50] something uh you will lose art on the
[13:53] even if this is something that's worth
[13:55] pursuing maybe there's something worth
[13:57] pursuing way more than that
[13:59] uh that's a good thing and I also liked
[14:01] what you talked about Bitcoin how uh
[14:04] about the pain uh running running
[14:07] against the door and I think more and
[14:09] more people running against that fear
[14:11] door that just does not open and they
[14:13] don't see the Bitcoin door and they they
[14:16] will try to figure out how to get
[14:18] through Fator more and more uh but more
[14:21] and more people really realize oh it's
[14:23] not opening and they will go through the
[14:25] the the kind of Bitcoin Bitcoin door and
[14:28] you also talked before we started a
[14:30] podcast about that you were really
[14:32] interested in power
[14:34] structures uh and this is something
[14:37] really interesting like Game Theory
[14:39] power structures Bitcoin how do you
[14:42] think will change how do you think will
[14:45] power structures can change in society
[14:49] uh in a family level but also like on a
[14:51] bigger political level level with
[14:54] Bitcoin yeah you know I man when I first
[14:57] went down the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole uh one
[15:00] of the first things I did is I just
[15:03] consumed all the Bitcoin media that I
[15:06] could so uh pardon me if I'm taking some
[15:08] of these things from you know the likes
[15:11] of you know breed love sailor series uh
[15:15] which I just just consumed relentlessly
[15:18] uh and I kept listening because it made
[15:20] sense you know I think you know in like
[15:23] an Information Age you know things
[15:26] another thing just real quick just to
[15:28] just provide some context you know I I
[15:30] listen to some Jordan Peterson stuff and
[15:34] uh one of the things I thought was super
[15:35] interesting was how he he he went down
[15:39] uh on a couple of his talks talking
[15:41] about like IQ I'm not trying to you know
[15:44] disparage anybody um but man there's
[15:47] just certain people I was in the
[15:49] military for example he talks about how
[15:50] the military is used often times to
[15:53] capture like low IQ people lower IQ
[15:55] people and provide an uh a meaningful
[15:58] outlet for them you know for work and
[16:00] such and uh uh I just think that some
[16:04] people just on the running into the door
[16:07] part they're just they're going to have
[16:10] to have somebody gently lead them down
[16:12] the path um other people are going to
[16:15] and I'm talking about the power
[16:16] structure of of Bitcoin Bitcoin in in my
[16:20] I I've allocated every asset that I can
[16:24] into Bitcoin just that's where I'm
[16:25] coming from um I think Bitcoin will win
[16:29] um or I wouldn't make such a bold bet so
[16:32] I think that that you know um I think
[16:36] that there's it's very useful for for us
[16:39] as bitcoiners to reach out to those that
[16:41] we care about and try to gently lead
[16:43] them to those that are willing to have
[16:45] an open ear um but I think by and large
[16:49] since we're such a small percentage of
[16:51] the population um people are just going
[16:54] to continue to see the successes of
[16:56] others um that maybe move towards a
[16:59] Bitcoin standard at least for U asset
[17:02] allocation you know there's nobody
[17:04] living that was at a you know
[17:06] cognitively aware age that has ever seen
[17:10] anything like this happen I mean you
[17:11] know we talk about like the Great
[17:12] Depression and stuff like that well um
[17:15] you know like my my grandma in-law she
[17:19] went through that stuff but she was a
[17:20] child she wasn't aware of any of that
[17:22] stuff I mean so a lot of those lessons
[17:24] have to be relearned just like a lot of
[17:26] the lessons of Communism and a lot of
[17:28] lessons like that you know that that
[17:30] people um so easily get distracted by
[17:32] rhetoric and and fed speak uh like you
[17:36] know they can say the Federal Reserve
[17:38] can say a lot of things and and
[17:40] eventually you realize like man I keep I
[17:43] keep touching the stove maybe I should
[17:45] stop touching the stove um because all
[17:48] it does is erode my the return on my
[17:51] labor but anyways to to go back to Power
[17:54] structures um I just think that it's
[17:56] going to it's going to be a grind I I I
[17:59] like the curve that describes like the
[18:01] bell curve if you will that describes
[18:03] like um you know Cipher punks early
[18:05] adopters you know major adoption late
[18:08] adopters so on and so forth I think that
[18:10] people are just going to be pushed into
[18:12] it and you know honestly the the the
[18:14] whole reason that that um uh Brian and
[18:18] myself started SATs saer it's I mean
[18:21] we're doing okay um it's not because um
[18:26] it's not because we you know anything
[18:28] other than we want to get
[18:30] people into Bitcoin in a way that
[18:36] is smooth enough that they won't give up
[18:39] you know in a way that's um removed so
[18:42] one of our goals for example is is start
[18:45] to Sovereign in 30 minutes right so like
[18:49] our goal is to create just what they
[18:53] need to know to help them kind of move
[18:56] down that path and ultimately if they're
[18:58] not interested they're not going to be
[18:59] interested but our goal is to you know
[19:01] use SATs saer for example to orange pill
[19:04] people um for people that already have
[19:05] Bitcoin to secure their seed words with
[19:08] our uh SATs saer system and then for
[19:11] people that uh are new that you're
[19:13] orange pilling to have some semblance of
[19:16] a of a guard rail or a handhold to get
[19:20] from um not knowing what it is to to
[19:23] being able to purchase it being able to
[19:25] store it feeling confident that you've
[19:28] that you transcribed your seed words in
[19:30] a way that nobody else is going to be
[19:32] able to to snatch them from you because
[19:35] really I mean what's happening right now
[19:37] is you cannot trust the pre-existing
[19:39] systems and structures to manage your
[19:41] financial future any longer um that was
[19:46] an epiphany that I had that just hit me
[19:48] like a ton of bricks and that's that
[19:52] happened before I went on my Bitcoin
[19:54] journey and that was like the
[19:55] precipitating you know idea that that I
[19:59] was just struck with and uh anyways so
[20:02] you know as far as SATs saer goes I mean
[20:04] that's kind of what our goal is is to to
[20:06] help people um to navigate these trying
[20:09] times but ultimately uh I think Bitcoin
[20:11] wins I think Bitcoin wins because it's a
[20:14] better system it's not centralized um
[20:16] you know it's based on rules not rulers
[20:18] um systems that have clear rules create
[20:21] an opportunity for people to have
[20:23] success because they know what to expect
[20:26] I mean good you know strong men make
[20:29] good times why do strong men make good
[20:31] times because there's a clear
[20:33] expectation of the behavior that's
[20:35] expected in order for you to participate
[20:37] in the market or the society or whatever
[20:40] you want to call it and upon those
[20:43] foundations let's say Bitcoin let's say
[20:46] strong code makes good times right so
[20:49] and upon those foundations you know you
[20:53] can start a business with the
[20:55] expectation of serving your clients and
[20:58] and not having to Fork over the Lion
[21:00] Share of your um labors to um an
[21:05] oppressive regime that could Target you
[21:07] however they want to without stating why
[21:10] or or whatever it is you know um but
[21:13] anyways sorry for the for the rant it's
[21:15] it's perfect I think uh we can summarize
[21:18] it's like Bitcoin is an extreme
[21:21] empowerment to just everybody it's like
[21:24] and not not just a specific group
[21:27] usually like system usually prefers A
[21:30] specific group uh if you have the feat
[21:32] system the closer you are to the central
[21:34] bank you preferred like Banks and
[21:36] governments and stuff like that and
[21:38] Bitcoin is just Bitcoin maybe prefers
[21:40] the group of hardworking people because
[21:43] it's a proof of work so uh I don't know
[21:45] it's a kind of the most Fair uh thing to
[21:48] do to prefer those who uh provide the
[21:52] most I
[21:53] guess well there's also many bitcoiners
[21:56] themselves that have broken themselves
[21:58] on Bitcoin you know I mean at the end of
[22:00] the day it's like it's truth and what I
[22:02] say by that is like man if you make bad
[22:06] decisions like I don't care if you like
[22:08] Bitcoin it's still going to keep running
[22:11] according to this like the rules you
[22:13] know if you make bad decisions with your
[22:15] money if something you know regretfully
[22:17] if something bad happens in your life
[22:18] and you have to sell Bitcoin to cover
[22:20] costs or whatever it is it's still going
[22:22] to keep turning but it's also creates an
[22:25] environment that that people can depend
[22:27] upon I guess is what is what it really
[22:30] boils down to is that we can depend upon
[22:33] the the framework to make our decisions
[22:36] and to Pivot you know towards something
[22:39] that um is the best return on our time
[22:41] and efforts so that's why I think it
[22:44] wins um and you know hey cool ETF you
[22:48] know thumbs up you know hopefully they
[22:49] have addresses that show that they're
[22:51] actually holding the Bitcoin in there um
[22:53] at the end of the day if those Bitcoin
[22:54] gets captured by the state or whatever
[22:56] all right well that just honestly makes
[22:58] freeone Mark of Bitcoin a little bit
[22:59] more valuable in my opinion um but uh
[23:03] anyways yeah bitcoin's exciting it's
[23:05] super exciting and people can talk about
[23:06] it nonstop you know thankfully that we
[23:09] have thankfully we have Twitter and
[23:10] things like that where we can we could
[23:12] communicate with other bitcoiners
[23:13] because we're such a there's so few of
[23:16] us you know and and and my goal really
[23:18] is to to to make getting into Bitcoin
[23:21] accessible for as many people as
[23:23] possible and uh just just you know for
[23:26] example seed word management there's so
[23:28] many bitcoiners I know I'm not going to
[23:30] say any names but I know bitcoiners I
[23:32] know people in the Bitcoin space that
[23:34] have been there that are well known um
[23:37] that don't custody their own Bitcoin and
[23:40] it's just something they're just not
[23:41] going to talk about obviously because
[23:42] they get a lot of grief for it um but uh
[23:46] just imagine you know Cindy who's 58 and
[23:51] it works at the grocery store like she's
[23:53] gonna be a little intimidated to put all
[23:55] of her assets into um you know all of
[23:58] her effort and savings and stuff and
[24:00] something that maybe not all of it but
[24:02] just a portion of it that's
[24:03] meaningful into into some words on a
[24:06] paper like ultimately I think I think
[24:08] Bitcoin ownership the fundamental step
[24:11] component of Bitcoin uh owner ownership
[24:14] is seed word
[24:16] management so um you got to have a you
[24:20] got to feel confident about it I
[24:21] remember when I was riding my seeds down
[24:23] the first time I was sitting in some
[24:25] like Back Country we own some land uh in
[24:29] Texas and I was sitting in in nowhere's
[24:33] Ville and I'm looking over my shoulder
[24:36] you know is somebody I've turned my
[24:38] phone off you know um I just you know it
[24:41] it's kind of goofy but um at the end of
[24:44] the day there's still that anxiety
[24:45] associated with man what if I mess it up
[24:48] but if you don't grab your financial
[24:52] future by the reins and take control of
[24:55] it like an untrained horse it's going to
[24:58] run you through the trees and you're
[25:00] going to get beat up by all the branches
[25:02] and and you're going to have to grab the
[25:05] rins and get it under control or you're
[25:06] just going to be battered as s custard
[25:08] is so important and it bothers me a lot
[25:11] that still a lot of bitcoiners as you
[25:13] said wellknown bitcoiners bitcoiners
[25:16] that have been in the space for a longer
[25:18] period of time I have friends that are
[25:20] 100% in Bitcoin uh still on their
[25:22] exchanges and I was like how can you
[25:24] grasp Bitcoin and don't make the ascent
[25:28] Cal step to self custody it it bothers
[25:31] me a lot how people cannot do it I had a
[25:34] lot of shitcoin face I did a lot of
[25:37] stupid stuff I needed three years from
[25:40] knowing about Bitcoin to getting over
[25:42] the hurdle of it's a scam and getting to
[25:46] first Bitcoin but the first thing I did
[25:49] as soon as I got Bitcoin self custody
[25:51] like the literally the the weekend I got
[25:54] orange pilled I told this a lot of times
[25:56] on the podcast I will not ramp about
[25:58] that but basically I fought it as a scam
[26:00] on Friday I went into the deep Rabbit
[26:03] Hole of Bitcoin end of Sunday I was like
[26:06] oh it's actually something it's not it
[26:08] doesn't has to be a scam so on Monday I
[26:10] I bought my first Bitcoin and I bought
[26:13] back in the day it was a good choice
[26:15] Ledger seemingly a good choice bought a
[26:17] ledger and I think uh three or four days
[26:21] later I had The Ledger and then I
[26:23] transferred my first like 10 EUR on
[26:26] there just to try it out just to get
[26:29] feeling for everything because I did not
[26:31] knew what I was doing I mean when you
[26:33] did it the first time I mean just did
[26:35] you have like a level of anxiety that
[26:37] was like unique I mean honestly it was
[26:41] it to me that's it just felt unique like
[26:44] I mean wow this is serious yeah yeah it
[26:47] was for me because it was not that uh
[26:50] high of an anxiety level because I just
[26:51] tried it out with like a really small
[26:53] amount of money so that's also something
[26:56] I recommend to people when when they
[26:58] first get into that start out with like
[27:01] a really small amount of money just to
[27:03] try yeah definitely for your first
[27:05] transactions of course to moving it from
[27:07] an exchange absolutely 100% I agree with
[27:10] that yeah and then then when you make
[27:12] that leap to you know throwing you know
[27:15] I don't know how many SATs you're
[27:17] throwing in there but when you make that
[27:18] leap to to to go Full Tilt self- custody
[27:22] um there is a level of anxiety
[27:24] associated with it and I feel like that
[27:27] is something that you know in a lot of
[27:29] ways it doesn't need to be there you
[27:31] know I mean we don't need to be storing
[27:33] our seed wordss on on a Google Drive um
[27:36] we don't need to be storing our seed
[27:38] Wares on any like piece of technology I
[27:40] think it's kind of poetic what the SATs
[27:42] saver is doing and I mean cold C I mean
[27:44] not cold card sorry U seed plates uh we
[27:48] actually recommend cold card but uh seed
[27:50] plates are similar um in a sense but
[27:54] it's kind of poetic that like literally
[27:56] the most robust
[27:58] technological like Computing system the
[28:01] Rob most robust Computing system the
[28:03] world has ever seen is um we're securing
[28:07] our seed words for assets stored on the
[28:10] blockchain or time chain with u written
[28:14] word I mean it's kind of poetic um and
[28:17] and I think it's really great too
[28:18] because it just restores that um that
[28:21] control U Back to the individual uh and
[28:25] the responsibility I mean it's a lot of
[28:27] life is about just hey you need to take
[28:29] take responsibility for your life you
[28:31] can't just go down through life the way
[28:34] everybody's the way you've been told to
[28:37] the Baby Boomers are the last generation
[28:39] in my opinion that that we're able to
[28:43] get away with that you know literally I
[28:46] don't want to get too hard on the Baby
[28:47] Boomers but I can go for a bit on this
[28:49] you know they they were handed life on a
[28:52] silver platter um the the greatest
[28:54] Financial expansion in history um they
[28:57] were
[28:58] uh the object of everybody's attentions
[29:00] and affections all marketing pivoted
[29:02] towards the baby boomer the sexual
[29:04] Revolution happened when they hit their
[29:06] sexual prime the Gen xers the latchkey
[29:09] kids were the product of the baby boomer
[29:11] who was pursuing self-actualization in
[29:14] the workforce you know all these things
[29:16] you know they bought they bought their
[29:18] first house for um a two sacks of
[29:21] potatoes and a plum and and you know now
[29:25] it's got 900k gains on it and uh you
[29:28] know I watched a a Joe Rogan snippet the
[29:31] other day and it's like again this is
[29:34] just I'm not trying to knock all baby
[29:36] boomers I'm just saying that by and
[29:38] large like there's a reason that there
[29:41] are generational stereotypes because
[29:43] they're typically um accurate but it's a
[29:47] way in a lot of in a lot of ways the
[29:49] gentleman on on Joe Rogan said they're
[29:52] they've experienced so much life but
[29:54] they have so little wisdom and I think
[29:56] in a lot of ways and that's really raw I
[29:59] don't want to those aren't my words but
[30:00] I'm just saying in my way in in my
[30:03] opinion I feel like we have a thirst for
[30:06] wisdom again you know like I it's I I
[30:10] consider personally this is kind of my
[30:12] definition I came up with several years
[30:14] back but I think wisdom is is kind of
[30:17] cons could be thought of as experiential
[30:19] knowledge we can have knowledge and we
[30:21] can throw it into life and experience it
[30:24] numerous times and actually start to
[30:26] develop a reasonable framework for um
[30:30] how to operate within the world and
[30:32] that's why I'm just that's that's all in
[30:33] the power structures kind of uh vein as
[30:36] well um for me that's why I'm really
[30:39] pumped about studying power structures
[30:40] as like a personal hobby there's a guy
[30:43] going down to the lake right
[30:45] there the neighbor anyways U maybe the
[30:49] question I should have asked at at the
[30:51] first uh first as the first question uh
[30:54] what actually is s saver for those who
[30:57] don't know s sa yeah so um so our
[31:00] philosophy for sat saer is that we want
[31:02] to make Bitcoin accessible we want to
[31:04] make people um get past any of the um
[31:09] psychological encumbrances that may be
[31:11] associated with taking self- custody um
[31:14] and the premise like I stated earlier is
[31:16] that seed word management is the
[31:17] fundamental step of Bitcoin ownership um
[31:20] you know if if you know I think I think
[31:23] uh if you consider a checking account
[31:25] that's just a promise to give you those
[31:27] dollars you don't have them in your
[31:29] pocket um hopefully the bank hopefully
[31:31] there's not a bank run right because
[31:33] you're not getting those those dollars
[31:34] you're you're not you're not getting
[31:36] your Bitcoin uh from FTX uh or Mount
[31:40] gaau I mean yeah I mean people are
[31:41] getting it back from Mount goau and FTX
[31:44] at 16,000 um or whatever the the rate
[31:47] was but at the end of the day you have
[31:49] to deal with a third party you have to
[31:52] deal with their responsibility I'll move
[31:54] on so what we've decided is that hey we
[31:58] want to make an educational pathway for
[32:00] people that don't know about Bitcoin we
[32:02] want to create a um a way for bitcoiners
[32:06] to orange pill people hey you know
[32:09] here's a SAT saer read through it take
[32:12] your time understand it there's
[32:14] resources on the website that we direct
[32:16] people to go to immediately you know go
[32:19] to the website to get started and uh
[32:21] when you when you do that um you have a
[32:24] are the ultimate final you know kind of
[32:27] product that we offer and we do offer a
[32:29] free do-it-yourself kit like if you've
[32:32] stacked too many SATs and you can't
[32:34] afford a SATs saver we still want you to
[32:36] use our system and maybe you can you
[32:38] know iterate it on it iterate on it in
[32:40] your own special way or whatever um but
[32:43] we want to create a system that's usable
[32:45] for people to custody their
[32:49] Bitcoin that's what you need to do if
[32:52] you own Bitcoin and you're not and it's
[32:54] not in self-
[32:55] custody you're doing it wrong that's not
[32:59] the whole point about Bitcoin is to
[33:01] create a system that can operate outside
[33:03] of the normal structures that we've
[33:06] grown accustomed to so anyways um people
[33:09] have got to learn those lessons
[33:10] themselves and I'm not going to you
[33:11] can't you can't make anybody do anything
[33:14] right U but you can come alongside them
[33:16] and hopefully encourage them to take a
[33:18] path that is more beneficial over the
[33:20] long term um but basically what we do is
[33:23] the the encryption guide that we offer
[33:26] in in a SATs saer here's a SATs saer kit
[33:29] all right um it comes with three you
[33:32] know we call these sat saers these cards
[33:34] right here they're water resistant it's
[33:36] got 26 spots on it right because we we
[33:38] have if you look at our website you'll
[33:40] see very clearly we have a couple of
[33:42] decoy words that are Incorporated in
[33:44] this one of the kind of interesting
[33:47] things I don't know if you saw in
[33:48] Colorado a gentleman got pulled over and
[33:50] his seed wordss were kind of folded up
[33:52] on a piece of paper and the officer was
[33:54] like opening it up and had his body Cam
[33:56] and his seed wordss are right there it's
[33:57] like our goal with SATs saer is that
[34:00] your seed words are safe even if seen I
[34:02] mean it's a pretty kind of big statement
[34:05] granted if you give your if everybody in
[34:08] the in the in the uh room knows your
[34:11] credit card number you know it's
[34:12] probably good to get it changed I mean
[34:14] my thing is is that you don't have to
[34:17] really rely um on Clever hiding spots or
[34:20] indestructible materials to protect your
[34:23] seed wordss you can encrypt them um with
[34:26] a SATs saer system so we have have our
[34:28] encryption guide I feel like it's it's
[34:30] pretty well done it walks you through
[34:32] step by step how to encrypt your seed
[34:35] wordss um you know it comes with a a a
[34:38] bip 39 list um great uh there's a
[34:42] practice card in it you know our our
[34:46] premise is that we can create this kit
[34:49] you can hand to people that you could
[34:50] use for yourself um that you can secure
[34:54] your seed words um maybe you have a a
[34:57] trust person like for me um I trust my
[35:00] wife I want her to know where a SATs
[35:04] saer is you know um there's a lot of
[35:07] other cool things if you look at SATs
[35:10] saver. so SATs saver. is our website um
[35:15] and we have uh you know slgo to get
[35:18] started um we have slashpro for some
[35:21] Advanced features like for example
[35:24] somebody you know comes up to me with a
[35:27] club and they say you know what's your
[35:29] past phrase or whatever and they they
[35:32] figure out the SATs saer system or
[35:34] whatever okay great you still have to
[35:35] have a PIN to unlock it um anyways um I
[35:39] can give them a duress word that leads
[35:42] them to a wallet that has however many
[35:47] you think is is enough to to dissuade
[35:50] them from pressing you further I could
[35:52] give um one of these to um my kids uh
[35:56] each of them I'd have to buy a few um
[35:59] but they can each have their own
[36:01] different pinword and decrypt the same
[36:03] exact words different ways um it's kind
[36:06] of a neat uh there's some neat things
[36:08] but it's all built upon what Bitcoin
[36:10] already offers us you know uh it's built
[36:14] upon this like really awesome system
[36:16] that I think we're really just beginning
[36:18] to scratch the surface of expanding on
[36:22] you know lightning an amazing thing I
[36:24] mean we're just getting starting with
[36:26] started with innovation associated with
[36:28] it but I think SATs saer is a is a
[36:31] incredibly useful tool so you don't just
[36:33] have your your seed word sitting around
[36:35] because I mean honestly if I found your
[36:36] seed plate I'll figure it out I think it
[36:38] does you know I I guess given enough
[36:41] time uh there's like three billion plus
[36:45] ways it could be
[36:46] decrypted but I guess given enough time
[36:49] uh maybe somebody sets up some software
[36:51] or something to decrypt it faster at
[36:53] least it gives it provides a layer of
[36:55] complexity for me to move stuff around
[36:58] um and and I don't just have um you know
[37:01] one comes with three you know I could
[37:03] put them in different places give them
[37:05] different people um or whatever so it's
[37:08] intended to be kind of like an
[37:10] all-in-one seed word solution um but you
[37:13] could do different things with it too
[37:14] man I'd love to talk to somebody doing
[37:16] seed plates and say hey let's make one
[37:17] with a couple extra lines on it and
[37:19] let's include the SATs saer process as
[37:22] well um but at the end of the day I
[37:25] think it's a great opportunity for
[37:26] people for the three reasons that I said
[37:29] before you know um to to start with
[37:32] Bitcoin to share Bitcoin and to secure
[37:34] your own seed words in a responsible and
[37:37] uh way way that you can feel confident
[37:39] in I'm super excited to announce that
[37:42] this podcast got the first ever sponsor
[37:46] 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one
[37:49] and they teach and preach self- custody
[37:52] this is my goto exchange when someone
[37:55] asks me oh where can I buy my Bitcoin
[37:58] from this is the easiest entry for
[38:00] bitcoiners and if you want lower fees
[38:03] Plus at the same time support this
[38:05] podcast use code Robin and click the
[38:08] link in the description yeah it's it's
[38:10] fascinating for me because that is
[38:12] another great system how people can uh
[38:15] self- custody their Bitcoin and there
[38:17] are a lot of different great tools out
[38:20] there how to keep your Bitcoin safe
[38:23] there are a lot of uh Services
[38:25] educational content out there how to
[38:27] keep it safe it's like there are
[38:28] channels only about that out there and
[38:32] people still don't do it what do you
[38:35] think keeps people from selfing their
[38:38] Bitcoin what do we have to do better in
[38:40] educating them making tools uh or is it
[38:43] something that will never be a mass
[38:44] adoption will always be for a smaller
[38:46] group of people I think that I saw this
[38:49] uh I guess we call it a meme yesterday
[38:54] and it had this adoption curve and there
[38:57] was just one line down the middle and it
[38:59] said on the left buy Bitcoin and on the
[39:03] right work for
[39:05] Bitcoin and uh you know I think people
[39:07] are going to have to have Bitcoin Maybe
[39:09] not maybe maybe it's not maybe not
[39:11] everybody um but the people that are
[39:14] intellectually capable of taking
[39:16] responsibility for their life are going
[39:17] to kind of hopefully be forced into it
[39:21] um not I mean not hopefully be forced
[39:23] into it hopefully realize the benefits
[39:25] that it provides and and if they're
[39:27] forced into it by their own
[39:28] decision-making is what I'm saying you
[39:30] know I mean you run into a wall a few uh
[39:32] too many times uh you're going to learn
[39:34] a lesson not to run in the wall but uh
[39:36] uh you know how do you get people to do
[39:38] it you know I I operate I operate on
[39:42] this it's I guess it's kind of like a
[39:43] non-coercion principle I think a
[39:46] non-coercion principle is really healthy
[39:48] like listen if I walk to you if I walk
[39:50] up to you every time you slap me in the
[39:51] face I'm G stop walking up to you that's
[39:53] a free market and it's natural law it's
[39:56] just the way people oper
[39:57] you you can you can argue and debate
[39:59] about how system should be and
[40:01] controlled but at the end of the day if
[40:03] you give me half the potatoes that I pay
[40:06] for every time I'm just going to go
[40:08] somewhere else and get my potatoes
[40:10] somewhere else right that's that's I
[40:13] have the freedom to operate the way I
[40:15] want to and so you know first of all
[40:19] people have to get to a pain point where
[40:22] it becomes important enough for them to
[40:25] manage their finances that they're
[40:27] willing to do it right I think a lot of
[40:30] that is happening right now I feel like
[40:31] we're watching Financial repression as
[40:33] Lyn Alden talks about um Financial
[40:36] repression is is a is a the means by
[40:39] which um governments I'm not trying to
[40:42] misquote her per se or technically you
[40:43] know if I don't get exactly right but is
[40:46] a way that governments Outsource their
[40:48] obligations to their people um they cut
[40:50] off the ESC Escape valves executive
[40:52] order 6102 um previously through history
[40:55] um mandated currencies and and you know
[40:58] so on and so forth genas Conan um
[41:00] offered uh utilize paper money when
[41:02] people would travel on the Silk Road and
[41:04] do trading Merchants would have to turn
[41:06] in their gold and and use the the
[41:08] currency that was permitted anyway so
[41:10] people are going to either have
[41:12] to feel it and understand the importance
[41:16] of taking responsibility for their own
[41:18] life um or people are going to have some
[41:22] kind of epiphany like I did and I think
[41:27] a lot of that honestly is because I have
[41:30] a lot of responsibilities so I spend a
[41:33] lot like with my family for for example
[41:36] so I spend my a lot of mental energy
[41:41] considering how I can best provide for
[41:43] my family and take responsibility um
[41:47] it's like one of those I don't know if
[41:48] this is a quote but I kind of think it
[41:50] should be heavy burdens make strong
[41:52] shoulders so you're either going to be
[41:54] crushed under the weight of it or you're
[41:56] going to make a way
[41:57] right and so um yeah how do we get more
[42:00] people to do it you can't make people do
[42:02] anything you know we can continue to it
[42:05] doesn't mean you shouldn't try um
[42:07] there's a word so I read the Bible
[42:09] there's a word in the Bible um it talks
[42:11] about uh
[42:12] servant or a Shepherd or to to minister
[42:16] in it's dooos and it means to kick up
[42:19] dust I can't just stand up looking down
[42:22] at people and say you I see what you're
[42:24] doing wrong you should do this and you
[42:25] should do that what I do need to do is
[42:28] if I through my life experience have
[42:30] experienced something similar maybe I
[42:31] can come down beside them and I see that
[42:34] they have something going on in their
[42:35] life I can come down beside them and I
[42:37] could try to like help lead them towards
[42:40] um a solution that's beneficial for them
[42:43] solution and take the time to explain it
[42:46] to them in a way that they understand I
[42:48] can't be pushy with it if if somebody
[42:50] doesn't want to hear what you have to
[42:51] say um don't get your feelings hurt
[42:53] don't let other people you know don't
[42:55] get your validation from S I mean that
[42:58] sounds kind of rough but it's true like
[43:00] you're I I want to if I if I want to be
[43:03] maximally good to people um I need to uh
[43:07] be able to interact with them without
[43:11] worrying without basing my like message
[43:15] the value of my message on what they
[43:17] think you know um so I think it's going
[43:20] to take a lot of effort for us to come
[43:22] alongside other people genuinely and
[43:24] take the time um it's kind of tricky
[43:27] like my mom she's probably watch this
[43:29] but you know I've tried to talk to my
[43:31] mom about Bitcoin so many times but you
[43:33] know there in families there's baggage
[43:36] in those relationships you know you he
[43:38] hear this all the time about bitcoiners
[43:40] you know you have the meme where like
[43:42] the the white guy in the Attic like the
[43:45] ghostly looking figure in the up in the
[43:47] attic like is he can't come down because
[43:51] he told everybody to buy Bitcoin at the
[43:53] top like I did and many of us have um
[43:55] and he feels a little bit embarrassed
[43:57] and everybody's haha laughing at them
[43:59] but at the end of the day um you know
[44:02] just caring about people if it matters
[44:04] enough to you you'll find a way and you
[44:05] can't force people to do it but
[44:07] hopefully you can create a meaningful
[44:09] way to connect with people enough that
[44:10] they understand that you're coming at
[44:12] them from a genuine perspective it's F
[44:14] it's fascinating how Bitcoin teaches you
[44:19] to have your own responsibility because
[44:22] everybody that has been in Bitcoin for
[44:24] the last I don't know three five 10
[44:26] years has has been humbled so many times
[44:29] maybe they have been involved in some
[44:31] hack from an exchange maybe they have
[44:33] been involved in because you said it
[44:35] earlier like with Celsius and stuff like
[44:37] that or M GA I heard I heard from some
[44:41] friends uh that were involved in Celsius
[44:44] that they are now starting to pay out a
[44:46] little bit again from that that it has
[44:48] been lost I saw that yellow said that he
[44:50] was getting paid yeah I saw I saw a Ming
[44:53] about it the other day that's that's
[44:56] amazing and also the the crashes alone
[44:59] even if you do the custody um completely
[45:02] right and you never lose it you never
[45:04] were involved in any hack or something
[45:07] like that and that's really rare I think
[45:09] if you never were involved in that at
[45:11] least if you're long in the game um even
[45:14] if you do that you go through so many
[45:17] 80% crashes 50% crashes and then the the
[45:20] volatility of a monetizing like the
[45:23] monetization of Bitcoin um the vol is
[45:28] just incredible especially when you got
[45:30] these like super sophisticated systems
[45:33] that are just jumping on every Trend and
[45:35] maximizing it and stuff I mean yeah it
[45:39] it it steals your mind you know in a
[45:41] sense of strengthens it um if you're con
[45:44] it tests your
[45:45] convictions it's called Uh Bible
[45:47] reference it's called proving like it
[45:49] proves you so that's a that's a good
[45:51] thing um because we're even more
[45:53] convicted and we're more empowered but
[45:56] yeah I agree you you know I've I've felt
[45:59] the pain but it's also it's also yet
[46:02] pain in the near term we have to have
[46:05] that kind of low time preference that we
[46:07] talk about a lot in Bitcoin uh it's
[46:09] funny there's like it's almost like the
[46:11] topics in Bitcoin are very cyclical
[46:12] because they they touch on so many
[46:14] aspects of what ultimately matters in a
[46:17] lot of these conversations is human
[46:20] nature I mean that's why we have Bitcoin
[46:22] we have Bitcoin because human nature
[46:24] is inherently attempting to get as much
[46:28] as it can for the least amount of effort
[46:32] possible and some people you know
[46:35] they're got they don't have any like
[46:37] moral anchoring to to their
[46:39] decision-making so they they like take
[46:43] advantage of people right um they
[46:45] inflate the currency away or you know
[46:47] they steal from other people or they
[46:49] they you know hurt other people to get
[46:52] what they want um and then other people
[46:54] you know that are willing to you know
[46:57] have uh moral uh bearing and boundaries
[47:01] and stuff they have to pursue life from
[47:03] a a different angle and I think that's
[47:05] actually a more robust way but it's a
[47:08] lower time preference way um and all
[47:10] these types of things that ultimately
[47:12] are are nuanced because we're dealing in
[47:15] the realm of you know human nature U
[47:19] which is exciting too it's it's
[47:20] fascinating and uh I saw now like you
[47:23] mentioned like two three times a Bible
[47:25] reference and it's fascinating for me
[47:28] also to see bitcoiners are really
[47:31] religious usually not not everybody of
[47:33] course they like bitcoiners is is now
[47:35] like such a big group where there is all
[47:38] kinds of people in there I was last like
[47:41] my last meet up I think in Austria where
[47:44] where there was in front of me uh to the
[47:46] left a complete carnivore that only ate
[47:49] meat and to the right of him was a raw
[47:51] vegan and it was lovely to see that uh
[47:54] in the Bitcoin Community Bitcoin unites
[47:56] us and they like discussed about food
[47:59] and and nutrition and they had a lot of
[48:01] similar things going on like fresh food
[48:03] cook yourself stuff like that uh and and
[48:06] yeah but the point I wanted to go to is
[48:09] like what do you see as the connection
[48:12] between religion and Bitcoin do you see
[48:15] there a special connection or is it just
[48:16] like two completely different uh topics
[48:19] for you you know I feel like again back
[48:21] to a statement that I made
[48:23] earlier is that we're seeking truth and
[48:28] so um my spiritual convictions were
[48:31] present um I I had to go on my own
[48:34] Journey there um that was uh an
[48:38] incredibly powerful Journey for another
[48:41] conversation maybe but um you can live a
[48:44] lie right or you can learn how the
[48:48] system really
[48:50] works and prepare accordingly right if
[48:53] you live a lie you can either be a
[48:55] victim or you can be dominating or part
[48:59] of a structure a structure or system
[49:01] that's intended to dominate other people
[49:04] and and you know um get the most amount
[49:08] that you can for the least amount of
[49:09] work right so you have like a
[49:11] agricultural kind of um when when did
[49:14] like the roving bands of Warriors start
[49:16] well very quickly after agriculture
[49:19] gained its firm Traction in societies
[49:22] because people were able to set aside
[49:24] goods and resources and hoard them and
[49:26] save them and then all I need is a sword
[49:29] or fire or a group of friends or just
[49:33] you know people with similar interests
[49:36] so if you're going to live a lie you can
[49:38] either be a victim or dominate people if
[49:40] you can live truth right you're going to
[49:43] say hey I can't be a
[49:46] victim because ultimately that's my
[49:49] decision to be a victim or
[49:51] not and uh you know hey a a lot of
[49:55] people have different opinions about uh
[49:59] religion I'm firmly convicted in my
[50:01] decisions um but at the end of the day I
[50:04] think we're all seeking for truth and
[50:06] you have a subset or a section of
[50:08] society that's in Bitcoin that's on you
[50:12] know this half of the curve and I would
[50:14] say that it's not even I would say it's
[50:16] more on the tales to be quite honest
[50:18] people that are not willing to like live
[50:22] a lie or intentionally fool themselves
[50:25] one reason that like for example back to
[50:27] my family they always
[50:29] ask um this is a Perfect Analogy but
[50:33] they ask um would you like to know the
[50:35] gender and it's like I'm like listen if
[50:37] somebody knows the gender it's gonna be
[50:39] me so I figured out how to read uh
[50:42] sonograms I've done enough of them you
[50:44] know but my thing is is I don't want
[50:48] there to be a truth out there that I
[50:52] don't access because I'm too lazy to or
[50:56] because
[50:57] living the it's so you know what's the
[51:00] opposite of truth untruth right so it
[51:03] could be like layers it doesn't have to
[51:05] be like a direct lie that's incred like
[51:07] directly oppositional to what you say
[51:10] but um it just is not truth so I don't
[51:14] want to I don't want to like live
[51:15] according to untruths when I know that
[51:18] there's a truth and then as these things
[51:20] come up you know you begin to establish
[51:23] your own pathway in life that's led by
[51:26] your
[51:28] convictions and um the work that you've
[51:31] done or or maybe like Brian Brian is an
[51:34] incredibly brilliant guy my uh very
[51:37] close friend and and business partner
[51:40] with souths saer this guy is just
[51:43] brilliant man Brian tells me anything
[51:45] about diet Brian tells me anything about
[51:48] like a number of topics I I honestly I
[51:51] trust you so much that I'm going to take
[51:53] your word for it because I mean he
[51:55] doesn't he doesn't expect me to do that
[51:56] because he he like I said before he'll
[51:59] take the time to explain to me but I'm
[52:01] like man that's great I love it thank
[52:03] you for shoring the learning curve for
[52:05] me you know and and when you can create
[52:08] like those types of healthy
[52:09] relationships where you have trust that
[52:10] can make your life magnified even more
[52:13] just like what I want to build with my
[52:14] family for example um but uh yeah I
[52:17] think uh I think bitcoiners are
[52:19] religious I think they're seeking for
[52:21] truth and maybe they're anti-religious
[52:24] because they're ultimately seeking for
[52:26] truth and that's where that's LED them
[52:28] here to for and a lot of reasons that
[52:30] you know you know people people have
[52:33] baggage in their lives you know and uh
[52:36] and and that can shape the way that we
[52:39] live our lives if we haven't dealt with
[52:41] that baggage and a lot of people have um
[52:44] baggage in their life about how to
[52:45] handle finances and a lot of people have
[52:47] baggage in their life about their diet a
[52:48] lot of people have baggage in their life
[52:50] about their medical decisions a lot of
[52:51] people have baggage in their life on
[52:52] fill in the blank and and if you're not
[52:54] willing to take you know the Reigns on
[52:58] those individual things or have trusted
[53:00] people that can you know be your
[53:02] multisig and help you kind of uh work
[53:06] through things together then you're
[53:09] you're you're basically saying I'm
[53:11] willing to you can't know everything but
[53:13] I'm willing to not search out this
[53:15] answer that is materially important to
[53:18] my life and and again like I said you
[53:21] can't know everything um but you also
[53:23] need to uh take responsibility for your
[53:25] life and I think that the type of a
[53:27] personality that these like earlier
[53:30] bitcoiners um maybe are manifesting in
[53:35] in one sense or another maybe wrong but
[53:37] just a thesis yeah I mean on the topic
[53:40] of truth I actually have some kind of
[53:43] personal news um some even know it um I
[53:47] actually today quit for good my normal
[53:51] job uh because I wanted to dedicate my
[53:54] full life now to bitcoin
[53:57] and thanks to 21 Bitcoin who sponsor
[53:59] podcast and other Bitcoin companies I
[54:01] can work with I can do that so there
[54:04] allowed me to to do exactly that step
[54:07] but it like the last year was difficult
[54:11] for me because I was like going towards
[54:14] more and more that Bitcoin uh way and
[54:17] seeing more and more Bitcoin as as the
[54:20] the thing I should focus 100% of my time
[54:24] on because it we so early it's like
[54:26] getting involved in the internet like in
[54:28] 1995 something like that yes and I was
[54:32] like but I wanted to do it right so I
[54:34] wanted to do it slowly and steadily and
[54:37] right not just rash into it I'm not the
[54:39] guy that rash into things like I want to
[54:41] do steady and good uh and so I'm finally
[54:45] now at this point where I'm like I quit
[54:48] uh the and I love my job actually it's
[54:50] like a really good one it's like it's
[54:52] just the topic was not right it was it
[54:54] security and I love Bitcoins so it was
[54:57] just a wrong topic the the employees uh
[55:00] the around me was amazing the boss
[55:02] wasn't there than me in my friends and
[55:05] family Circle because it was a really
[55:07] good one but for me it was the truth
[55:09] that Bitcoin is the thing that I want to
[55:11] focus on and when this the truth is and
[55:14] you seek truth and most bitcoiners seek
[55:16] the truth then you have to go for it
[55:19] even if you have to sacrifice something
[55:20] even have to go through a route that
[55:23] maybe is a little bit more not so sure
[55:27] and uh yeah I just wanted to throw that
[55:28] in because I think that's an exciting
[55:30] thing I'm super excited for you um and
[55:33] you know what there's no telling where
[55:34] it'll go you're going to have to make
[55:36] your best decision as you travel down
[55:39] that but I think one of the most
[55:40] exciting things about it in our in our
[55:42] like High Time preference World a lot of
[55:44] people pursue things that they're
[55:46] passionate about right and then and then
[55:48] also uh in this world there's almost a
[55:51] dichotomy maybe they have two different
[55:53] lives running they have something that
[55:54] there's they're they're passion about
[55:56] and then they have something they do for
[55:58] money like that's their purpose I earn
[56:01] money doing it now the real magic
[56:03] happens when you can blend passion and
[56:05] purpose that's where you find in my
[56:07] opinion the exciting um
[56:11] springboard both you know intellectually
[56:14] motivationally and then uh you know
[56:17] wonderful things happen when you're when
[56:20] you're pursuing something that not only
[56:23] um is purposeful um but you're
[56:26] passionate about so that's really
[56:27] excited exciting to hear and and you
[56:30] know uh I I've really enjoyed uh
[56:33] watching your content especially uh on
[56:35] Twitter too I love how you post
[56:36] everything there makes it so cool um but
[56:39] so I'm excited that's great news to hear
[56:41] I'm also excited it's like it felt
[56:43] really freeing also it's and it it was
[56:45] not that I was kept somewhere but it was
[56:48] not living up to my fullest truth and
[56:51] it's I loved what you saying about
[56:53] religion and and and Bitcoin how Bitcoin
[56:56] and also religion is like that finding
[56:59] your truth and sticking to it yeah and
[57:03] maybe to uh um round up the the podcast
[57:06] we having an end routine in the podcast
[57:08] where the previous guest is asking the
[57:11] next guest a question and they're going
[57:13] from various topics sometimes really pH
[57:16] philosophical sometimes it's just about
[57:19] uh some technical questions and now we
[57:22] have I think for the first time uh an
[57:25] obvious question that
[57:27] nobody asked till now I think we have
[57:29] some similar questions in the past it's
[57:31] like what it's crazy that that
[57:34] progression is not coming up till now
[57:36] but what's your price prediction for the
[57:38] next poll cycle for this poll
[57:40] cycle man price for you know I either
[57:45] I'm gonna be a hyper bll or I'm G to be
[57:48] too bearish right so you know uh let's
[57:51] say let's say we have three greens one
[57:54] red I think I think that we're going to
[57:56] to be in a sustained bull
[57:58] cycle for you know one of my family
[58:01] members that told me about Bitcoin in
[58:04] 2013 really great guy um I said no he's
[58:08] like dude let me give you like just give
[58:10] me like a thousand bucks I'll buy some
[58:12] bigcoin for you anyways uh bad decision
[58:15] I didn't fall through on that but I was
[58:16] very prideful and I was stuck in my
[58:18] place at the time he said I talked to
[58:20] him a couple years back just he said
[58:23] this a couple years back he said I don't
[58:24] even look at the price anymore and I'm
[58:26] not going to lie I look at the price I
[58:28] can go for months without looking at the
[58:30] price but when there's price action I'm
[58:31] looking at it that being said um man I
[58:34] hate to make predictions however I think
[58:38] that I don't even know let's say a year
[58:40] from now what what what time Target are
[58:42] we talking about uh end of the bull
[58:44] cycle uh okay end of the bull cycle I
[58:47] mean I think that you know I mean when
[58:50] is the bull cycle considered over I mean
[58:52] I just think that we've crossed the
[58:53] Rubicon if you will I think that it's
[58:56] kind of like I don't think that there's
[58:58] I think that there's going to be draw
[59:00] Downs because some weird you know
[59:01] geopolitical things are going to happen
[59:03] where government says you know uh M like
[59:07] this whole mining business where they're
[59:08] trying to stop Bitcoin miners are making
[59:11] them register and blah blah blah if they
[59:13] really try to choke down our throats
[59:16] this like like climate change garbage um
[59:20] and say that it's better to release
[59:22] methane into the atmosphere than carbon
[59:24] dioxide then that could be that could be
[59:26] a bummer you know but uh I think that
[59:28] we're going to be you know in in a bull
[59:31] cycle kind of
[59:33] potentially moving forward and I think
[59:35] that we might see some price Discovery
[59:39] coming up maybe in the next like two
[59:42] years that's just going to melt faces um
[59:46] and then uh maybe three years who knows
[59:48] and then I think there's just going to
[59:49] be a continuously trudging upwards of
[59:53] the Bitcoin price shoot I'd love to see
[59:56] any big number Hal calling 10 million um
[60:00] you know 1 million's out there I think
[60:04] that uh so so I guess time frames are
[60:07] are really what would be required for me
[60:09] to determine I'd shoot $ trillion dollar
[60:12] Bitcoin it's a question that I would
[60:15] never ask uh myself because for me it's
[60:18] like the Bitcoin price in on its
[60:20] fundament fundamental thing it does not
[60:23] matter because we are doing uh we are
[60:26] doing Bitcoin because we don't want Fiat
[60:28] why should we measure Bitcoin in Fiat
[60:30] then but it it makes it's a it's a lot
[60:33] of fun and newbies are coming in because
[60:35] of n Go up technology so yeah yeah I'm
[60:38] gonna say this I'm gonna say this I
[60:39] believe that there's going to be a
[60:41] material price increase where people
[60:44] right now are going to get a lot more
[60:48] purchasing power of the dollar like of
[60:53] the dollar denominated Bitcoin value and
[60:56] then I think it's going to just continue
[60:58] to go up in a lot of ways because um
[61:02] inflation right so I think that like a
[61:04] lot of price Discovery is going to
[61:05] happen because the system is growing and
[61:09] there are so many more people that want
[61:10] Bitcoin and there's so many people that
[61:13] like have deeper Pockets that want
[61:16] Bitcoin and not even enough Bitcoin for
[61:18] Mill all the millionaires to have one
[61:20] you know so I think I think that there's
[61:22] going to be a a chunk of time that
[61:25] happens
[61:26] when the price of Bitcoin moves up
[61:29] significantly more rapidly um and
[61:31] that'll probably happen within the next
[61:34] you know three to five years probably
[61:36] sooner I would hope it's sooner um but
[61:41] then um you know I I just don't know
[61:43] what these nation states are thinking
[61:45] right now I mean what are they even
[61:46] thinking I mean this is like kind of
[61:48] like somewhat I mean nothing's
[61:50] Incorruptible but I mean maybe that
[61:53] maybe Bitcoin it's it's like a system
[61:55] that they're literally going to be
[61:58] brought under the hand if you will of of
[62:01] the network in in a lot of ways and then
[62:04] I think if if as long as these money
[62:07] printers continue to run then I think
[62:08] the purchasing power will not
[62:11] necessarily increase but the number go
[62:13] up will continue so that's my point I
[62:18] think that I think that we're going to
[62:19] see a a a massive appreciation in so
[62:22] like for example how much does a state
[62:24] cost now I think
[62:26] we're going to be able to get for our
[62:28] Bitcoin we're not going to be able to
[62:29] get like same cost of stake I think
[62:32] we're going to be able to buy thousand
[62:35] Stakes right but then past a certain
[62:38] point I think that it's going to be okay
[62:41] I'm gonna buy be able to buy a thousand
[62:42] Stakes or whatever the big number is
[62:44] right but those Stakes are going to cost
[62:47] so much more than they did previously um
[62:51] so I don't know who knows that's a hard
[62:53] question to ask because I do think a
[62:55] million ion dollar Bitcoin is in play
[62:57] for sure that's not even I I totally
[62:59] believe that yeah as you you mentioned
[63:03] really good because there's like two
[63:04] things to it first the Bitcoin network
[63:06] is growing and sucking up more financial
[63:08] energy from all the assets and then
[63:10] there is when you measure it just in the
[63:13] fear terms there's inflation because
[63:14] they have to print more every year this
[63:17] cycle will only be more and more vicious
[63:21] and so the the price just has to go up
[63:24] in terms of the US dollar denomination
[63:26] but also it will go up in in in
[63:28] purchasing power I I think too that's
[63:31] that could be delineated in maybe
[63:32] another point that I met and maybe they
[63:34] don't they don't like go hand inand here
[63:36] but there's people that are that are
[63:38] going to have this Epiphany and seek out
[63:40] a better return or a better opportunity
[63:44] or they're willing to take
[63:46] responsibility before they're forced to
[63:48] take responsibility they're willing to
[63:50] take responsibility for their life and
[63:52] maybe those people are going to get into
[63:54] the the the first wave where you
[63:56] actually can increase the amount like
[63:59] your purchasing power actually goes up
[64:01] and then there's other people that are
[64:02] going to just be drug behind that um are
[64:06] going to
[64:07] just you know they're gonna yeah number
[64:10] is going to go up but it's going to be
[64:12] in relative terms to actually like Goods
[64:14] Services um you know Commodities in the
[64:17] marketplace yeah it's a I think it's a
[64:19] great way also to to end the podcast and
