[00:00] Bitcoin is larger than every other
[00:01] crypto asset combined bitcoin's won that
[00:03] Narrative of store of value that is the
[00:05] biggest narrative to win it's the
[00:06] biggest Tam it's 100 trillion dollar Tam
[00:09] it's bigger than everything else
[00:10] combined when you hear about the
[00:11] circular economy on bitcoin a lot of
[00:13] bitcoiners are looking for that physical
[00:15] circular economy but they're missing the
[00:16] far bigger picture it's the digital
[00:18] circular economy that matters money
[00:20] needs to be the most secure layer of
[00:22] this financial system that's where you
[00:24] want minimal changes very rarely that's
[00:26] your rock solid base I like that game
[00:29] theoretic tradeoff for bit coin because
[00:30] I'd like to be able to survive a state
[00:31] level attack that's why I store most of
[00:33] my wealth in Bitcoin NTS on top of
[00:34] Bitcoin are far superior than ethereum
[00:37] defi is a critical component of that it
[00:39] magnifies the use case of Bitcoin it
[00:41] allows us to build a financial system
[00:42] that's separate from the existing one on
[00:44] top of Bitcoin and it allows Bitcoin to
[00:46] grab back market share in terms of
[00:47] market dominance doesn't that corrupt
[00:49] Bitcoin these institutions buying it
[00:50] does that change Bitcoin bitcoin's code
[00:52] didn't change one bit they all bent the
[00:54] need of Bitcoin and acknowledge that
[00:55] Bitcoin is King and that Bitcoin is a
[00:57] superior money
[01:02] how important do you see in general
[01:05] layer two technologies uh for Bitcoin uh
[01:08] story long term that's a great question
[01:11] so layer 2 Tech is how the Bitcoin
[01:14] Community which came together and during
[01:15] the Block siiz Wars basically agreed
[01:18] upon that layered scaling was how we're
[01:20] going to scale Bitcoin that Bitcoin was
[01:22] going to scale in like layer twos now
[01:25] layer twos that that exist so far um
[01:29] that are at least have been around for a
[01:31] while and are in use would be lightning
[01:34] uh liquid Stacks
[01:37] um uh root stock those are kind of the
[01:40] bread and butter LTS that exist in
[01:41] Bitcoin so far um because of the
[01:44] agreement the community made with each
[01:47] with each other that we would scale
[01:48] Bitcoin in layers um I think the L2 that
[01:52] I think because of that l2s have been
[01:54] vastly underexplored lightning will not
[01:57] scale Bitcoin for the world uh lightning
[02:00] is a great piece of technology and I
[02:02] have nothing negative to say about it
[02:03] other than that it's not a catchall for
[02:05] all Innovation and it's not a catchall
[02:07] for L2 scaling Tech um that's why I'm
[02:11] excited to see a sort of explosion of
[02:13] Bitcoin l2s and ones that will explore
[02:16] different design surface areas to allow
[02:20] uh for scalability of Bitcoin allow for
[02:22] smart contracts on bitcoin um so for me
[02:25] it's critically important for Bitcoin to
[02:26] scale and I think it's very been very
[02:28] underexplored and I don't think that
[02:30] lightning is the single
[02:33] solution is uh is the layer two the last
[02:36] layer or do you see like a more if there
[02:39] like different approaches like there
[02:40] like the onion approach that we have
[02:41] fitco in the middle and then a lot of
[02:43] layer twos or do we have to stack layers
[02:46] uh above each other yeah it's a good
[02:48] question I think it's mainly all solved
[02:49] by l2s I know that there's been a
[02:51] conversation on ethereum about
[02:53] l3s uh I think you know l2s are
[02:56] basically completely centralized l2s
[02:59] usually give up some level of
[03:00] decentralization to become an L2 um Your
[03:03] settlement guarantee is always best on
[03:05] L1 especially the Bitcoin L1 um I do
[03:08] think there's some interesting things
[03:09] though by the way soft Fork proposal
[03:11] wise where Bitcoin l2s might be as
[03:13] secure as a Bitcoin L1 for example opcat
[03:16] as a proposal a software proposal that
[03:18] would allow for trustless bridging
[03:20] bridging means you take your Bitcoin at
[03:22] an L1 and you pop it up to an L2 or you
[03:25] bridge it you bridge it from the L1 to
[03:26] an L2 that's why the term exists um
[03:29] bridging right now is is usually a
[03:31] little bit of a risky maneuver and so uh
[03:34] or like for example especially if the
[03:35] asset has been wrapped so if Bitcoin has
[03:37] been wrapped on its L1 and it's not
[03:40] represented on the L2 in a way that
[03:41] isn't fully secure then people who are
[03:44] using Bitcoin on L2 are using a Bitcoin
[03:46] that's a little bit less secure um
[03:48] that's where I think opcat and other
[03:49] implementations you know could lead to a
[03:51] trustless bridge in architecture which I
[03:54] think that might be the holy grail for a
[03:56] flourishing of activity to happen on
[03:58] bitcoin l2s
[04:00] interesting um now to the topic of defi
[04:04] um for me it's interesting defi the name
[04:06] because it's called decentralized
[04:08] finance and it's like okay decentralized
[04:10] Finance it's Bitcoin is decentralized
[04:14] money decentralized Finance so like what
[04:16] is defi for you yeah it's a great
[04:19] question so I think defi is definitely a
[04:21] misnomer which means that people use it
[04:22] for everything that this stand for
[04:24] decentralized finance what it actually
[04:26] represents is a sliding scale of
[04:28] decentral decentralized Finance where a
[04:31] lot of the trust assumptions
[04:33] are you know a bit tricky so for example
[04:36] uh most if you look at the architecture
[04:38] of most D5 projects there's usually a
[04:41] Federated or threshold or multisig model
[04:44] where you know you look at liquid for
[04:46] example liquid of Bitcoin L2 does the
[04:47] same thing as a Federated model which is
[04:49] basically a fancy word for say multisig
[04:51] now there are different threshold or
[04:53] Federated models to choose from so
[04:55] certainly there's a game theoretic
[04:57] security curve here of better and worse
[04:59] solution
[05:00] um you know when we look at uh
[05:04] decentralized what does that really mean
[05:06] I mean Bitcoin in certain scenarios
[05:08] breaks down from a game theoretic
[05:10] perspective right like Bitcoin is the
[05:12] most secure thing in crypto by far of
[05:15] course but it is not perfect I mean
[05:18] there is a scenario where they you know
[05:20] you could as a malicious actor if you
[05:21] spent enough money and this is why we
[05:23] call Bitcoins minor fees paid to miners
[05:26] in the block you know the block road
[05:28] which is fees and and newly Meed Bitcoin
[05:30] paid to miners we call that the security
[05:31] budget security budget represents the
[05:34] game theoretic Financial uh trade-off
[05:37] that miners make to behave properly of
[05:39] course state level actors could behave
[05:41] improperly and could be willing to burn
[05:43] like a hundred billion dollars of mining
[05:45] equipment they would be able to disrupt
[05:46] Bitcoin to a large extent you know so
[05:48] Bitcoin in and of itself is most
[05:50] decentralized and I would say can take
[05:52] the take the uh take the Throne of
[05:55] decentralization in terms of owning that
[05:57] from the best amount of decentralization
[05:59] but but there to be clear Bitcoin
[06:01] there's nothing perfect like nothing is
[06:02] perfectly secure um when we look at on
[06:05] the decentralization curve like for
[06:07] defi there's a lot of different things
[06:10] I've seen I've spent the last three
[06:11] years spending time over on the salana
[06:12] and ethereum ecosystems looking at some
[06:14] of their design
[06:15] architectures um look like a there's a
[06:18] lot of things that are issues you know
[06:20] like or you've got the Oracle problem
[06:22] you've got you know if things are
[06:24] Federated or um Federated like the
[06:27] Federated multisig model like that's an
[06:29] issue as well um there could be how the
[06:32] governance token works these are all
[06:35] different uh kind of attack vectors but
[06:38] I do think it's interesting on the defi
[06:39] world so like what does it mean to me I
[06:41] think that was the original question
[06:42] like defi mean means the I think the
[06:44] attempt to replicate some elements of
[06:46] Finance onto blockchain Tech in a way
[06:49] that uh allows for minimized
[06:52] counterparty risk um you know when it
[06:55] comes to counter parties uh what's nice
[06:58] about D5 protocols is that it usually
[06:59] reduces your counterparty risk to close
[07:01] to zero however you have protocol risk
[07:05] so protocol risk means there could be a
[07:07] zero day exploit in the protocol there
[07:09] could be a flaw with the governance
[07:10] token or the game theoretic security
[07:12] model those things are material issues
[07:15] and I think it's been very uh I think
[07:18] very intellectually dishonest by a lot
[07:20] of the ethereum def5 folks of just kind
[07:22] of waving those concerns to the side
[07:23] they're like oh yeah so that happened
[07:25] but anyways decentralized finan is what
[07:27] people should use and I'm like I do
[07:29] agree Gates the future I like what we're
[07:32] doing here but there should be a really
[07:34] big Aster around like this is
[07:38] risk-free it's not risk-free these are
[07:41] you have protocol risk um so anyways
[07:44] that was a long-winded way to talk about
[07:46] you know what I think defi is how how
[07:49] decentralized do I think it is and and
[07:51] what that really means interesting um as
[07:54] you also brought up altcoins do you
[07:56] think that uh the use case of altcoin
[07:59] and the value of altcoin can be then
[08:01] built on on top of of Bitcoin and then
[08:03] there's all only Bitcoin uh as a base
[08:05] layer a little bit like the internet
[08:08] protocols I think so I think this cycle
[08:10] we're going to see Bitcoin dominance go
[08:11] up we're going to see for example with
[08:13] brc2 tokens and with ordinals we saw
[08:16] asset types built on top of Bitcoin this
[08:19] is very bullish for Bitcoin I think a
[08:20] lot of people look at this as mutually
[08:22] exclusive versus Bitcoin underlying
[08:24] bitcoin's underlying value prop is
[08:25] digital gold well is digital gold that
[08:28] you can etch other contracts to it's
[08:29] this digital gold that you can root your
[08:32] other blockchain in uh some for example
[08:34] some blockchains are like through
[08:36] Babylon they're using Bitcoin and using
[08:39] Bitcoin as staked collateral for other
[08:42] blockchains if you have a proof of stake
[08:43] chain what asset would you want to stake
[08:45] to stake your chain with Bitcoin that's
[08:47] pretty cool and I don't think a lot of
[08:49] uh ethereum or Bitcoin people even
[08:51] thought that was going to be a thing but
[08:52] now that it is I think that's really
[08:54] cool like Bitcoin still adhering to its
[08:57] digital gold Roots it's a store value
[08:59] Asset and people want to use a pristine
[09:01] piece of collateral for staking for
[09:03] borrowing against it using as collateral
[09:05] to borrow dollars or whatever other
[09:06] asset you like to borrow also to ET your
[09:09] ordinal on to um you know I think it's a
[09:12] really beautiful interplay between the
[09:14] two narratives I don't think they're
[09:16] conflicting what's what's interesting is
[09:18] that ped Maxis don't understand too that
[09:20] this is how Bitcoin wins like Bitcoin
[09:23] dominance has been dropping since
[09:25] 2017 and while a lot of that is stable
[09:27] coins and there's certainly churn in the
[09:30] competitive set so there's a lot of
[09:31] crypto assets that go to zero I would
[09:33] like Bitcoin to claim 80% dominance
[09:36] again and that's through you know
[09:38] allowing all these other things to be
[09:39] built on top of Bitcoin and so yes I
[09:42] don't you know I'm not going to go hard
[09:44] shill those assets for people to go buy
[09:45] I still think Bitcoin is the best return
[09:47] per unit of risk that you can get you
[09:49] know so that's never changed for me but
[09:52] uh I think people very much
[09:53] underestimate how massive this will be
[09:55] imagine a hundred billion dollar in
[09:57] demand for Bitcoin just for
[10:00] uh staking on other chains like that
[10:01] that's incredible like that amount of
[10:03] demand for Bitcoin far out strips the
[10:06] corporate demand like for example like
[10:07] Michael sailor from U you know micro
[10:10] strategy and other corporates all of
[10:11] them combined hundred billion dollars
[10:13] might outstrip that um and so for me
[10:17] like when we look at how this is
[10:20] developing these narratives that other
[10:23] l1s we're using are starting to to
[10:25] crumble and aod for example nfts on top
[10:28] of Bitcoin are far far superior than
[10:30] ethereum the graphic asset exists on
[10:32] chain it's not pointing to an ipfs file
[10:35] on some C you know somewhere else where
[10:36] it could just disappear um you have to
[10:40] spend proof of work to etch it there is
[10:43] no you can't issue a thousand nfts on
[10:45] bitcoin and they're free no you have to
[10:47] etch it and it it's very costly to do so
[10:49] it's like Ed like I said kind of like
[10:51] stamping or etching an image into gold
[10:54] um and then finally there's no smart
[10:55] contract associated with the asset
[10:57] issuance so
[11:00] um there's no changing the smart
[11:02] contract after you've issued these nft
[11:04] assets to change how many exist Etc
[11:06] they're etched into digital gold and
[11:08] then it's there for forever so that was
[11:10] a really interesting play where like
[11:12] nfts on bitcoin I think are superior
[11:14] from a decentralization standpoint than
[11:16] entities on entities on bitcoin are a
[11:19] superior than entities on ethereum and
[11:21] then the other things like uh tokens
[11:23] that can be issued on bitcoin I think
[11:25] Bitcoin l2s have a far stronger value
[11:27] prop than l2s on ethereum L2 on bitcoin
[11:30] not only are faster and cheaper but also
[11:32] are more they give you more
[11:33] expressibility you know some of these
[11:35] are svm or um evm so what that means is
[11:38] that your Bitcoin on this L2 can be in a
[11:42] smart contract you can borrow against it
[11:43] you can lend it all these sort of things
[11:45] that you can do on ethereum and salana
[11:47] so I think this cycle Bitcoin reclaims
[11:50] that Narrative of uh you know it had the
[11:53] solid narrative at digital gold and now
[11:54] it's digital gold plus uh these other
[11:57] narratives where it's like uh bringing
[11:58] on other assets on top of Bitcoin the
[12:01] one thing I want to leave people with
[12:02] here is that when you hear about the the
[12:04] circular economy on bitcoin a lot of
[12:07] bitcoiners are looking for that physical
[12:08] circular economy but they're missing the
[12:10] far bigger picture it's the digital
[12:13] circular economy that matters and the
[12:15] digital circular economy as we saw on
[12:17] salon and ethereum was massive 100
[12:20] billion plus the physical circular
[12:22] economy on bitcoin is almost nothing
[12:24] almost no one buys things with Bitcoin
[12:26] there's very few Merchant activity for
[12:28] the simple reason if people don't want
[12:30] to sell their Bitcoin to buy stuff and
[12:31] it doesn't solve a problem uh using your
[12:33] Bitcoin to spend is not cheaper faster
[12:35] or easier than existing payment methods
[12:38] um you know no one's shaving off gold
[12:39] flakes at the at the grocery store to
[12:41] pay for things with gold they use gold
[12:43] as a store value Asset now do people
[12:45] want to speculate with gold they want to
[12:47] use it as collateral absolutely and so
[12:49] what we saw on ethereum and salana was
[12:51] indeed they do not want to spend their
[12:52] ethereum or salana what they want to do
[12:54] is stake it lend it borrow it etc those
[12:57] financial games those financial
[12:58] Primitives are what people are brought
[13:00] into that circular economy is what built
[13:02] out a hundred billion dollar plus
[13:04] ecosystem on ethereum and on a Bitcoin
[13:06] you know ecosystem we're talking about a
[13:08] multi hundred billion dollar ecosystem
[13:10] so yes I think this is how Bitcoin
[13:12] claims market dominance back again uh
[13:15] this is how uh I think Bitcoin
[13:17] ultimately solves its security budget
[13:19] problem and also it provides defi on top
[13:21] of Bitcoin which a lot of people want to
[13:23] perform these activities like a lot of
[13:25] folks call these speculation everything
[13:27] is speculative whether it be bonds
[13:29] stocks options things are always
[13:32] speculative and so if people want to
[13:33] perform that on bitcoin I'm all about it
[13:35] if that increases demand for Bitcoin and
[13:36] makes it stronger long term it's a good
[13:39] point because uh like a lot of people
[13:41] would call me a Bitcoin maximalist but
[13:44] I'm more like a freedom free market
[13:46] maximal list so I I'm up for like what
[13:49] the free free market uh dictates uh it
[13:52] will do uh and I think it's positive if
[13:55] we can get narrative back from from from
[13:58] the coins I think altcoins are mostly a
[14:02] distraction from the Bitcoin narrative
[14:04] um which is interesting because for me
[14:06] Bitcoin maximal listen is like oh you
[14:08] want things on bitcoin and in Bitcoin so
[14:12] having defi on top of Bitcoin instead of
[14:14] altcoins is kind of Bitcoin maximalism
[14:17] narrative for me because it it brings
[14:19] more things into Bitcoin do you also see
[14:22] it like that yeah what's an interesting
[14:24] perspective here is what is a Bitcoin
[14:25] Max must and when when were they a
[14:27] Bitcoin Max must during what are
[14:29] so I'm one of the oldest ones and the
[14:32] reason why we're Maxis back in the 13th
[14:34] through 17th cycle is there was just
[14:37] total garbage out there like you had
[14:39] feathercoin Litecoin these were just
[14:42] merely knockoffs that were trying to
[14:43] compete against Bitcoin as of money
[14:45] these weren't anything Innovative or
[14:47] serious uh that era was just kind of you
[14:50] know strewn with a bunch of really poor
[14:53] projects nothing interesting um 17
[14:56] through 2021 of course you have the Ico
[14:58] booth boom mainly pump and dump Cash
[15:01] Cash grabs not a lot of innovation there
[15:04] either I would say post 2020 2020 you
[15:07] had the defi summer defi summer I think
[15:09] really changed things because there's
[15:11] two new different types of assets that
[15:12] came out that were really interesting
[15:15] and these assets don't compete with
[15:16] Bitcoin as money just like equities and
[15:17] bonds don't compete with a dollar same
[15:19] with equities and bonds don't compete
[15:21] with gold um they're just different
[15:22] asset types and those two assets that
[15:24] emerged from that that I found
[15:25] interesting were nfts um I'm not here to
[15:28] aine as to the quality of people's Arc
[15:30] projects as a Libertarian I naturally
[15:33] have first principles thinking which is
[15:35] all value is subjective someone's suit
[15:38] is someone is someone else's t-shirt
[15:40] which is someone else's Lobster like no
[15:42] one no one can tell me what is a good or
[15:45] bad use of my money it's totally
[15:46] subjective um and so with nfts like it's
[15:50] a really cool way to have a uniquely
[15:51] digital scarce item it's non-fungible so
[15:54] it means it's one of one or it's a
[15:56] unique item that's super cool I think
[15:59] that that's a unique type of asset that
[16:00] does not compete with Bitcoin just like
[16:02] art doesn't compete with gold and then
[16:04] we have money use case of course which
[16:06] is Bitcoin and then the a new emergent
[16:08] use case would be like new emergent
[16:10] asset type would be uh governance tokens
[16:13] so governance tokens are or quasi
[16:15] resembling a form of equity where with
[16:17] governance tokens protocol uh
[16:20] participants can receive an income
[16:22] stream or they can uh go vote on
[16:25] proposals or in some sort of
[16:26] Representative manner now look are those
[16:29] like are government's tokens
[16:31] decentralized no not nearly as
[16:33] decentralized as Bitcoin it's not trying
[16:35] to compete with money it's like arguing
[16:37] like how's decentralized as a company
[16:38] and I'm like they're not they're
[16:40] completely centralized that's not a bad
[16:42] or good thing it just depends on what
[16:44] problem you're trying to solve so with
[16:46] the company it needs to be centralized
[16:48] because of a hierarchical command and
[16:49] control structure to decide what to go
[16:51] build and solve problems for a customer
[16:53] with protocols you know these daps that
[16:55] have been built for Lending or borrowing
[16:57] um they semi-active road maps which
[17:00] means that they need to need to change
[17:02] things and Implement things where money
[17:04] needs to be the most secure layer of
[17:06] this financial system that's where you
[17:08] want minimal changes very rarely that's
[17:11] your Rock Bottom solid solid base you
[17:14] know then you have this D5 scaffolding
[17:16] and they don't need to be as secure as
[17:18] the base right um just like a company
[17:20] doesn't have to have as much credibility
[17:22] as the US government when it comes to to
[17:24] the representation of the dollar so
[17:27] those two unique asset classes that
[17:29] unique asset types I think were very
[17:30] interesting where they came out and I
[17:32] was like these are very different they
[17:33] don't compete with Bitcoin as a money
[17:35] and I don't perceive them as a scam like
[17:37] certainly there are scams in nfts there
[17:39] are scams in governance tokens there's
[17:41] also scams with the dollar and there's
[17:43] also scams with Bitcoin doesn't make
[17:45] Bitcoin bad or the dollar bad because
[17:46] scams are done by it it's a unique asset
[17:48] type and I think a lot of the hardcore
[17:50] Pur and Maxi's talked about oh well
[17:52] scams happen with in nfts or ethereum
[17:54] and I'm like I'm from the oldest cohort
[17:57] of bitcoiners there's so many scams that
[17:59] were just in Bitcoin back in the 13
[18:01] through 16 era like if you want to look
[18:04] at that and say that uh you know these
[18:06] that that the underlying asset is
[18:08] responsible for the scams is is pretty
[18:10] ridiculous
[18:12] um longwind did we we were talking about
[18:14] Bitcoin maximalism the modern version of
[18:16] Bitcoin maximalism didn't didn't exist
[18:18] until about 2020 after safe Tings the
[18:20] Bitcoin standard Bitcoin standard
[18:22] moralized Bitcoin transactions so it
[18:26] created a moral framework for money and
[18:29] and started to moralize decision- making
[18:31] uh for example there's a rant in there
[18:33] about Modern Art um as being like a scam
[18:37] or a a symbol of Fiat money so the
[18:41] there's quite a few flaws in this and
[18:42] this is what creates Bitcoin I call them
[18:45] Puritan maximalists they're not really
[18:47] maximalist the earliest maximalists were
[18:48] not these types at all the earliest
[18:50] maximalists were like everything else is
[18:52] kind of trash if there's ever cool
[18:54] things that get developed on these other
[18:55] chains will'll bring it back to bitcoin
[18:57] that was a very popular narrative
[18:59] um and they were very libertarian which
[19:01] meant hey man if you want to buy pink
[19:02] flamingos and put them in your front
[19:04] lawn I don't I don't think it's a great
[19:06] choice but like it's all on you that's
[19:08] not a scam like to sell someone Pink
[19:09] Flamingos wouldn't be a scam the modern
[19:12] maximalists are heavily influenced by
[19:14] saine's book and these are very new
[19:16] people to bitcoin they're very very
[19:17] they've only been around a few years
[19:18] these are not the core old group um with
[19:22] moralizing transactions they violate
[19:24] core first principles think thinking of
[19:26] libertarian ideology which is that all
[19:28] value subjective
[19:29] um a lot of them have moralized
[19:31] everything from diet to other things and
[19:34] blame it at all on fiat currency when if
[19:37] you just spent two minutes Googling you
[19:39] know the gold standard like life wasn't
[19:41] great on that there's all sorts of
[19:43] Horrors uh Wars wars are extremely
[19:46] common on a gold standard you also had
[19:49] very poor diet you had poor everything
[19:51] in lifestyle if you look at you our
[19:53] world and data they they calculate The
[19:55] Human Condition and look at different
[19:57] ways to measure that during the gold
[19:59] standard life was just as shitty as any
[20:01] other's way um you know while money does
[20:05] solve many life's problems and money is
[20:07] the core underlying most valuable thing
[20:09] of our world it's certainly not a
[20:11] Panacea for everything and so I think
[20:13] the Bitcoin standard radicalized these
[20:14] bitcoiners and made them Puritans who
[20:18] have then moralized everything and now
[20:20] now it's it's not okay to you know
[20:23] everything they don't like is called
[20:24] Fiat and uh everything that isn't
[20:27] exactly what they prefer is is uh kind
[20:29] of labeled as immoral which is silly um
[20:32] you know moralizing every transaction is
[20:35] the opposite of libertarian ideology if
[20:37] you do that then Society breaks down as
[20:39] people then judge you based on every
[20:41] single thing that you do and moralize
[20:43] your consumption of food and
[20:44] entertainment and everything else if you
[20:46] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[20:48] regular basis I'll guess you already
[20:50] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[20:53] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[20:56] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[20:59] personal recommendation for hard wallet
[21:01] is the bitbox it's super secure it's
[21:03] simple to set up it's also perfect gift

[21:52] they are the experts in cyber security
[21:55] in Bitcoin self custody and how to be a
[21:58] secure sovereign individual in general
[22:01] and last but not least I have something
[22:03] completely new for you guys I partnered
[22:07] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[22:10] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[22:13] saw created by anyone look at that
[22:16] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[22:18] made a perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[22:22] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[22:25] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[22:27] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[22:31] make sure to check out the link in the
[22:33] description for this amazing coin
[22:35] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[22:37] amazing I love them so much it was
[22:39] really hard for me to pick the one that
[22:41] I want to have because there are a lot
[22:43] of great options I went with the new
[22:46] transparency Edition they are all
[22:49] limited so grab yours those will not be
[22:52] available for a long time but there will
[22:54] come new models and new amazing designs
[22:57] along the way I see that Al like I see
[22:59] the extreme a lot uh when we like
[23:01] talking about like oh money fixes
[23:03] everything I do think money makes makes
[23:05] a difference like what money we as a
[23:08] society uses but it doesn't influence
[23:11] everything like there there are problems
[23:13] also with human psychology so um what
[23:17] what do you think uh will happen if we
[23:20] are on a sound money standard against
[23:22] like a highly printed standard is is
[23:24] there like something that you see like
[23:26] okay that actually will change
[23:29] yeah I think a lot of things will change
[23:30] I also agree with your perspective it's
[23:32] not that things won't change it's just
[23:34] not a everything's not going to change
[23:35] and that everything is dependent on that
[23:37] so when we look at what might change you
[23:39] know for example easy ones to call out
[23:42] if Bitcoin reduces the government's
[23:43] capability of printing money and
[23:45] spending more than they have then social
[23:47] programs will be cut and tax rates would
[23:49] likely be lower um that's a good thing
[23:51] for society because governments are very
[23:53] bad at allocating Capital very wasteful
[23:56] and so that would mean that we're more
[23:57] productive as as a society which means
[23:59] that we produce more goods and services
[24:01] to solve problems for for humans which I
[24:04] believe would Usher in um definitely
[24:06] improvements in technology talking about
[24:09] medical technology where we could live
[24:11] longer um solve underlying health issues
[24:14] we'd have you know we probably have a a
[24:17] less
[24:17] regulatory strong framework as well
[24:20] where like maybe regulations would also
[24:21] be minimized due to this du the
[24:22] lessening power of the government so we
[24:25] might actually have flying cars you
[24:26] might have you know space you know space
[24:29] travel like they're hindered by some of
[24:30] these regulatory issues and also um the
[24:33] government's giving tons like two or
[24:36] three times the amount to their
[24:37] competitors like Boeing pure capitalist
[24:39] Endeavors will flourish and that means
[24:41] that through capitalism every company's
[24:43] just trying to solve a problem for
[24:45] someone trying to make your life easier
[24:46] better faster whatever so we would see
[24:49] Society flourish as a whole in that
[24:50] regard this that does not solve the
[24:53] moral framework uh someone's subjective
[24:55] moral stance on how moral Society is
[24:58] I don't know if that would improve crime
[25:00] or not it may or may not I don't know if
[25:02] it would improve Wars or not certainly
[25:05] would make Wars a little bit more cost
[25:07] prohibitive uh but in the gold standard
[25:09] we didn't see any lessening of Wars at
[25:11] all compared to the post gold standard
[25:13] so um nuclear weapons of course game
[25:16] theoretically led to the uh reduction in
[25:18] Warfare because the the war between two
[25:21] parties have nukes would be the end of
[25:23] civilization so you know uh Bitcoin I
[25:27] think solves economic problem problems
[25:28] which then solve human problems because
[25:30] companies are solving human problems I
[25:32] don't think that solves happiness and I
[25:34] don't think that solves
[25:35] morality yeah humans are still humans um
[25:40] one topic with with defi that I'm also
[25:43] wondering um because there is uh like a
[25:47] centralized database is in most cases
[25:49] more efficient than a D5 project uh just
[25:53] from a technology standpoint but you
[25:56] also want to have maybe some features
[25:57] that you actually want to decentralize
[25:59] to some extent where would you say is
[26:02] the is the line between oh we that can
[26:05] live on on a this on a centralized
[26:08] Oracle database and it doesn't need to
[26:10] have some Bitcoin or some crypto thing
[26:13] on top of it uh and and on those project
[26:16] actually make sense to build on top of
[26:18] Bitcoin yeah so let's start with
[26:20] something that's very centralized stable
[26:23] coins uh usdc and usdt completely cized
[26:29] there is no defi architecture for that
[26:30] at all none uh nothing that would even
[26:34] the word decentralized could be used in
[26:35] it's completely centralized it's a
[26:37] wrapper around a real dollar in a bank
[26:39] account that's then been tokenized and
[26:41] represented on
[26:42] blockchains um despite that we've seen a
[26:45] massive amount of activity occurring
[26:47] with stable coins stable coins are
[26:49] arguably probably one of the highest
[26:51] product Market fit things you know
[26:53] outside of bitcoin's use case as a store
[26:55] value money um highest product Market
[26:58] fit use cases in the crypto ecosystem um
[27:01] I was very skeptical of tether and very
[27:04] skeptical of centralized Services when
[27:05] they came out many many years ago um for
[27:08] a simple reason of like yeah they could
[27:10] go seize all the money in the bank
[27:11] account and then all that tether that's
[27:12] out there would be worthless um you know
[27:15] it's completely centralized it has no
[27:17] SEC no security guarantees other than
[27:19] our trust in that institution but
[27:21] despite that people want to use these
[27:23] stable coins and the volume and and
[27:26] market caps of these stable coins are m
[27:28] massive so that shows that there is
[27:30] Market interest in completely
[27:31] centralized solutions that are simply
[27:33] integrating the old world dollars into
[27:35] our new world then we go along that
[27:37] Spectrum right so that's like completely
[27:39] centralized and bitcoin's decentralized
[27:41] and there's a spectrum of other daps and
[27:43] other things that could be there adaps
[27:45] and other like Financial
[27:47] Primitives and so you know with those
[27:51] I'm again as as a capitalist and as a
[27:53] Libertarian what I believe in is that
[27:54] the market will choose what it chooses
[27:56] to invest in um I personally have qualms
[28:00] or issues with how certain protocols
[28:03] have labeled themselves as decentralized
[28:05] and how secure they've labeled
[28:07] themselves as for many years I yelled
[28:10] and yelled and yelled you know hey these
[28:12] are not as secure as you think there's
[28:14] issues with this don't trust them and
[28:17] yet the market over and over and over
[28:18] again continues to use them right same
[28:21] with again stable coin stable coins are
[28:22] completely centralized storing your
[28:24] money in tether or usdc is risky right
[28:27] so
[28:29] I later realized you know look like in a
[28:32] in a Libertarian system you can't baby
[28:34] people and you can't baby them into
[28:37] adhering to your own subjective level of
[28:39] security like my private Key Management
[28:41] is is quite rigorous a lot of people
[28:43] don't do that you know we can yell all
[28:45] we want about how bad or good a a
[28:47] private Key Management setup is but most
[28:50] people will probably stick to what they
[28:52] like doing um I think education is
[28:54] important of course and I think people
[28:55] should call out game theoretic
[28:57] weaknesses like protocols or in Cold
[28:59] Storage methods Etc but with these
[29:02] protocols what we've seen is that the
[29:03] market is fully willing to embrace
[29:05] solutions that are I would say in the
[29:07] midpoint between centralized and
[29:09] decentralized on the on the on the
[29:11] decentralization curve for example the
[29:14] first L2 on ethereum is polygon uh one
[29:17] of the first l2s on bitcoin was was U
[29:20] liquid they're a Federated bottel that's
[29:22] just a multisig model that's that's the
[29:25] very basic game theoretic security which
[29:27] is like
[29:28] not the best and despite that the market
[29:31] has what what it polygon has like an8
[29:34] billion dollar market cap people are
[29:36] okay with that um so ultimately I think
[29:39] it's up to the market to decide their
[29:40] risk levels and also you look at a lot
[29:42] of the Bitcoin Maxis talk about ethereum
[29:44] and salana as like these will inevitably
[29:46] like collapse
[29:48] fail yes salana breaks down once in a
[29:50] while but it comes back and the market
[29:52] doesn't seem to care right same with um
[29:56] same with ethereum like ethereum game
[29:58] theoretically like with the
[30:00] ETF you could have if ETFs hold a lot of
[30:04] ethereum then that is actually leads to
[30:06] a huge issue with proof of stake systems
[30:08] bitcoin's not proof of stake so it
[30:09] doesn't matter how many Bitcoin Black
[30:11] Rock accumulates they can't control the
[30:13] protocol with proof of stake systems
[30:15] they can um so naturally there's a
[30:17] long-term security attack Factor there
[30:19] with ethereum but the market hasn't
[30:21] priced it in or the market doesn't care
[30:23] now uh with any asset in the world it
[30:26] doesn't matter what the mark market
[30:28] prices it has ultimately has to come
[30:29] back to a reality where if there is a
[30:31] material issue with the security the
[30:33] price could go to zero so I do think we
[30:36] might see something called the Great
[30:37] filter event so the great filter event
[30:39] is an event that uh scientists talk
[30:42] about where when we look at at the stars
[30:43] why don't we see a ton of alien
[30:45] civilizations shooting us radio signals
[30:47] or bombarding us with messages so
[30:50] there's a there's a concept called the
[30:51] Great filter which is that there's a
[30:52] certain moment in Civilization that most
[30:54] civilizations don't get pasted uh it
[30:57] could it might just be civilization it
[30:58] might also just be a just a planet as a
[31:01] whole for example maybe life never
[31:03] becomes
[31:04] multicellular maybe maybe you only have
[31:07] very primitive animals but you never get
[31:08] a really you know a very intelligent
[31:10] animal U maybe civilizations have
[31:13] occurred frequently but they when they
[31:15] discover nuclear weapons 99 out of 100
[31:17] times they die you know so these sort of
[31:20] moments I think when we look at crypto
[31:23] crypto hasn't had its great filter
[31:25] moment where we haven't seen governments
[31:27] attack crypto crypto like we've seen
[31:28] them kind of soft attack it but if every
[31:31] government in the world United and tried
[31:32] to attack crypto which ones would
[31:34] survive that's where I think you know if
[31:36] that moment occurs then these assets
[31:39] might trade really much lower as people
[31:41] go whoa this is super risky um I don't
[31:44] think that moment's going to happen
[31:46] though so if that moment doesn't happen
[31:48] bitcoiners might have over optimized on
[31:50] security now I like that game theoretic
[31:52] trade-off for Bitcoin because I'd like
[31:54] to be able to survive a state level
[31:56] attack that's why I store most of my
[31:57] wealth in
[31:58] Bitcoin but you know if we are wrong and
[32:01] a state level attack never occurs we
[32:04] might have over architected our security
[32:06] I'm playing devil's advocate here
[32:07] because again like I said I put my money
[32:09] in Bitcoin that's what I want to hold
[32:11] long term but Playing devil's advocate
[32:14] if these other if governments never
[32:15] attack crypto or if like the game
[32:16] theoretic attack for the other cryptos
[32:18] are high enough to survive state level
[32:20] attack then um then these protocols may
[32:23] never die and I think some of the
[32:24] Bitcoin Maxi Puritans are you know
[32:27] saying yes these will will collapse and
[32:29] I'm like I agree they I don't like their
[32:32] architecture and I would not invest in
[32:33] them but to say they will for sure
[32:35] collaps is it maybe it's interesting um
[32:39] I mean we saw a little bit of that in
[32:41] the internet adoption with theom bubble
[32:44] where a lot of companies and early Pro
[32:47] startups were washed out and uh the the
[32:49] good ones obviously stayed with with
[32:52] yeah apple and Microsoft and Amazon um
[32:55] also with uh e that there's also
[32:57] interesting I think I looked it up like
[32:59] a week ago or something like that the
[33:00] numbers uh since they switched from
[33:02] proof of work to proof of stake uh when
[33:05] you measured against Bitcoin it is like
[33:07] down like 40 or 50% some something along
[33:10] those lines um do you think that same
[33:15] event Could Happen even without the
[33:17] state level attack in uh in in in
[33:21] Bitcoin where the market just like
[33:23] washes the things out as in Internet and
[33:26] then maybe also on the E thing what do
[33:28] you think about that well I've been
[33:29] waiting 12 years to see it happen you
[33:32] know I uh the fact that like Litecoin is
[33:35] still around is absurd in xrp like a
[33:39]  10 years right like 10
[33:43] years I mean I can't believe it's been
[33:45] around that long right it's just I mean
[33:47] what what is litecoin's narrative I
[33:49] don't even get like first of all by the
[33:50] way I like Charlie Lee an early early
[33:52] builder in the space he's a good person
[33:54] but like Litecoin the project what's the
[33:57] narrative like a knockoff
[33:59] Bitcoin it doesn't even have like a fun
[34:01] New narrative and uh so that one I find
[34:03] completely bizarre uh same I mean
[34:06] dogecoins at least mtic you know they
[34:08] have like memes on its side Litecoin is
[34:10] just like a really cheap knockoff um and
[34:13] then xrp is completely bogus uh there's
[34:16] no banks that like xrp but retail thinks
[34:19] that Banks like like xrp and for some
[34:21] reason that's why xrp has continued to
[34:23] exist um so I don't know it's the 10
[34:27] years is the long time I thought these
[34:28] would have been washed out a long time
[34:30] ago um now 99% of the other ones in
[34:33] those cohorts did but these things could
[34:36] last a lot longer than we expect like
[34:38] how how long does human irrationality
[34:39] exist forever so I think on on a very
[34:44] longtime Horizons they in their price
[34:46] relative to bitcoin they Trend to zero
[34:49] like from a a you know altcoin over
[34:52] Bitcoin
[34:53] ratio will their values ever go to zero
[34:56] I don't know may maybe over a lifetime
[34:59] uh but uh you know I thought that this
[35:01] moment would have happened sooner
[35:02] especially with things that are
[35:03] objectively stupid Litecoin xrp I mean
[35:06] those are easy to pick on right these
[35:08] are these aren't even like there's not
[35:10] even a narrative like zcash or Monero
[35:12] where it's like oh it's privacy coin you
[35:13] know it's like a cheap knockoff
[35:16] Bitcoin and a completely useless piece
[35:18] of technology xrp so you know I would
[35:22] say decades at a minimum for these all
[35:24] to Trend to zero I think if you look at
[35:27] all altcoin pairs relative to bitcoin
[35:29] most of the time they are trending to
[35:30] zero through each cycle over and over
[35:32] and over um these things take a very
[35:34] long time to play out uh what's
[35:36] interesting about crypto assets is that
[35:38] they are Global and mimetic and much
[35:43] different than like there's no
[35:44] underlying fundamental value of of
[35:47] ethereum Salon or Bitcoin other than
[35:50] aggregate shared belief in it so it's
[35:52] not like an equity where you're like
[35:53] yeah well their cash flows went negative
[35:55] what's the company worth you know like
[35:57] in they continue to go negative they're
[35:58] e through the cash and then what's left
[36:00] it's not a situation like that like
[36:02] what's the subjective value of Litecoin
[36:04] the value of Litecoin will exist as long
[36:05] as a group of people any group of people
[36:08] believe in it and the value of it is
[36:10] determined based on the size of the
[36:11] number of group of people so that number
[36:13] will just likely shrink over time and
[36:15] that's where its value will shrink as
[36:16] well but yeah anyway that's a long went
[36:19] way to say thought altcoins were going
[36:21] to disappear longer like a a lot sooner
[36:23] a lot faster especially the ones that
[36:25] are quite silly um I think they'll exist
[36:27] for
[36:28] decades interesting um as you have been
[36:32] very long already in the in the Bitcoin
[36:34] Community uh for longer than most people
[36:37] that are still speaking about Bitcoin um
[36:42] what how has your knowledge and your
[36:44] view on bitcoin changed uh over the
[36:46] years yeah good question my my core
[36:48] original thesis which I still believe in
[36:50] is is bitcoin's digital gold this has an
[36:54] unwavering opinion I've had since I got
[36:56] into Bitcoin in 2012 I studied finance
[36:58] and undergrad during the 2008 financial
[37:00] crisis and when I graduated in 2010 a
[37:03] year later he discovered Bitcoin I was
[37:05] like this is the solution to the problem
[37:06] now of course I didn't right away figure
[37:08] that out took me a little while of
[37:09] reading about it but the 21 million hard
[37:12] cap was a really brilliant breakthrough
[37:14] why 21 million versus another fixed
[37:16] number that doesn't matter but what
[37:18] matters is that it's fixed there is no
[37:20] appropriate rate of inflation or
[37:23] deflation the issue of inflation or
[37:25] deflation will be a constant political
[37:27] attack factor and would constantly be uh
[37:29] probed and used against Bitcoin over
[37:31] time and there's no way to set an
[37:33] appropriate rate satoshi's Brilliance is
[37:35] having a fixed rate or sorry a fixed
[37:37] amount that fixed amount then has the
[37:40] whole world and the whole world's
[37:42] economy re architect around itself run
[37:43] this fixed fixed number of coins so the
[37:46] problem is in the rate of the
[37:48] appropriate rate of inflation or
[37:49] deflation is zero which is brilliant so
[37:52] for me this felt like a solved a problem
[37:54] in economics and the digital gold thesis
[37:56] says like this is a story value Asset it
[37:58] has all those parameters that you would
[37:59] want out of a store value Asset so in
[38:02] terms of Bitcoin being store value gold
[38:04] 2.0 we saw the last cycle really
[38:06] crystallized that thesis and I think
[38:08] that that's been the original purpose of
[38:10] Bitcoin all along it's definitely not
[38:11] for payments um was in that that's been
[38:14] crystallized and very much solidified
[38:16] and the reason why it's solidified is
[38:18] that's the actually the problem that
[38:19] Bitcoin solves look at what problem
[38:21] Bitcoin protocol solves and solves that
[38:23] problem um I think what we'll see emerge
[38:26] out of this you know see what what has
[38:27] changed my opinion over the last few
[38:29] years around defi is the idea that
[38:31] you've got this solid gold Foundation
[38:34] you've got this asset that you want to
[38:35] use as collateral for borrowing against
[38:37] or you want to use it for staking or you
[38:39] want to use it for whatever else or you
[38:40] want to stamp something into it
[38:43] bitcoin's won that Narrative of store
[38:44] value that's that is the biggest
[38:46] narrative to win it's the biggest Tam um
[38:49] you know it's a hundred trillion dollar
[38:50] Tam it's bigger than everything else
[38:52] combined and once you win that you know
[38:54] winning the store value narrative once
[38:56] you've won that it's over for everything
[38:58] else like ethereum will never be as
[39:01] sound of money as Bitcoin and so as much
[39:03] as the ethereum folks try to lar about
[39:04] that they'll never have that sound money
[39:06] aspect that Bitcoin has sound money
[39:08] means credibility not a rate of
[39:10] inflation or deflation in bitcoin's
[39:13] monetary policy is the most credible on
[39:14] the planet now with defi though I think
[39:17] this magnifies that store a value use
[39:19] case it allows people to use Bitcoin and
[39:21] uses that as a a piece of collateral and
[39:24] other things which increases demand for
[39:25] Bitcoin which ultimately makes the price
[39:27] go up which makes it more successful as
[39:29] the price goes up people become more
[39:31] aware of it it becomes more credible
[39:32] more people buy into it more
[39:33] institutions buy into it and this is how
[39:35] Bitcoin meanss itself into becoming the
[39:37] world Reserve currency so I do think
[39:40] defi is a critical component of that
[39:42] like I said it magnifies the use case of
[39:44] Bitcoin um it allows us to build a
[39:46] financial system that's separate from
[39:48] the existing one on top of Bitcoin and
[39:50] it allows Bitcoin to grab back market
[39:52] share in terms of market dominance
[39:54] really interesting uh to ask that before
[39:57] because uh I want to lead up to the next
[39:59] question um we we have now so many
[40:02] interesting and different uh narratives
[40:04] in Bitcoin uh we have nation states ETFs
[40:08] us elections Trump spoke at Nashville we
[40:10] have def5 we have like really a lot of
[40:13] uh I mean it speaks to the the growth of
[40:16] the Bitcoin Community I guess um where
[40:18] do you think is like the what is the the
[40:21] biggest narrative over the next like
[40:22] five 10 years for Bitcoin and what will
[40:25] be the the the big stories that will
[40:27] drive
[40:29] Bitcoin look store value number go up
[40:31] like that's Bitcoin increased use and
[40:34] belief as a story value Asset will be
[40:36] the uh headline headline news uh Bitcoin
[40:40] will increasingly be adopted by input on
[40:42] the balance sheet of Corporations will
[40:44] be increasingly adopted by governments
[40:46] if Trump wins the election there might
[40:47] even be a strategic Bitcoin Reserve that
[40:50] kicks off a game theoretic move that is
[40:52] the ultimate last final move in the move
[40:55] of being money is when governments
[40:57] game theoretically wonder if other
[40:59] governments are buying it that's the
[41:00] ultimate maneuver that's the final
[41:02] battle and bitcoin's on the cusp of that
[41:04] which is phenomenal so from here for the
[41:06] next five to 10 years that's the core
[41:07] thing is that more governments more
[41:10] people more businesses buy and put
[41:11] Bitcoin in their balance sheet and that
[41:13] over time that makes that makes Bitcoin
[41:16] that is what winning looks like people
[41:18] are like well doesn't that corrupt
[41:20] Bitcoin these institutions buying it
[41:21] does that change Bitcoin bitcoin's code
[41:24] didn't change one bit Bitcoin they all
[41:27] the need of Bitcoin and acknowledge that
[41:28] Bitcoin is King and that Bitcoin is a
[41:30] superior money this will continue for
[41:33] the next couple decades but the next 10
[41:34] years I think will be very exciting as
[41:36] we see Bitcoin reach its you know full
[41:39] achievement of being a world Reserve
[41:40] currency to be a world Reserve currency
[41:42] governments and corporations have to
[41:43] hold it and own it and want it and
[41:44] investment Banks too um you know on the
[41:47] defi side of things like I said I think
[41:49] that this will people are very
[41:51] underestimating the size of what Defi
[41:53] and Bitcoin could be um I've got a fund
[41:56] in the space so it's called asymmetric
[41:57] Bitcoin D5 Venture fund we invest in
[41:59] Bitcoin startups building uh Bitcoin D5
[42:02] protocols
[42:03] so people I think don't really grock the
[42:07] the magnitude of this Bitcoin is larger
[42:10] than every other crypto asset combined
[42:12] not just larger than theing but it's not
[42:14] all that combined when we look at tvl
[42:16] total value locked or defi activity on
[42:18] top of these other chains if Bitcoin
[42:20] were to have that level of activity on
[42:22] its own chain like whether that be on
[42:24] either l2s or ordinals with like TBL and
[42:28] uh dap usage and um market cap of these
[42:32] other l2s we're talking like a a world
[42:35] where a Bitcoin L2 might be worth you
[42:36] know $150 billion dollars uh the other
[42:39] l2s might be worth tens of billions and
[42:41] the other ones be worth billions we
[42:43] might see total value locked on bitcoin
[42:46] hit you know for example like if
[42:47] bitcoin's at a four trillion market cap
[42:50] and a fourth of that is locked into
[42:51] Bitcoin defi it's a trillion dollars
[42:54] locked up into defi on top of Bitcoin I
[42:56] don't think people really Rock how
[42:58] massive this shift could be and so if
[43:01] that happens I think those narratives
[43:02] will be really critical both for the
[43:05] successive Bitcoin as in continuing its
[43:08] uh phenomenon as a store value Asset and
[43:10] especially store value Asset in a
[43:11] digital circular economy but also I mean
[43:14] that just starts to absorb market share
[43:16] from all these other chains back into
[43:18] Bitcoin um and by absorbing that I think
[43:21] long term like I Bitcoin has a couple
[43:24] different ways it could lose one is if
[43:25] more people believe in another chain
[43:26] than Bitcoin and so if we can win the
[43:29] back that market share that completely
[43:31] permanently solidifies bitcoin's
[43:33] long-term value and look I think Bitcoin
[43:35] is going to win no matter what but I
[43:37] don't like to rest and I don't like to
[43:39] just hope that happens I want to make
[43:40] sure it happens so whether it be inside
[43:43] of crypto or outside of crypto competing
[43:45] with fiat currency and gold Bitcoin is a
[43:48] story value Asset green in a prominence
[43:49] and Bitcoin defi are both things that I
[43:51] think help Bitcoin cement and achieve
[43:53] its long-term locked in position as the
[43:55] new world preserve asset beautiful I
[43:58] think so too um really cool we come now
[44:00] to the end routine uh where I have two
[44:03] questions the first question is the same
[44:05] for every guest uh and it is what can we
[44:07] learn from you besides all the things
[44:09] that we already talked about yeah so
[44:12] follow me on Twitter at Dan held um I
[44:15] think you'll see a lot more content also
[44:17] subscribe to my newsletter the held
[44:18] report the held report is a newsletter
[44:20] that comes out one or two times a month
[44:22] and we cover Bitcoin defi topics so if
[44:24] you're curious about what you've heard
[44:25] on this call you're like what's more
[44:26] tangible real what are some of the l2s
[44:29] that you're talking about we cover that
[44:31] in there um those are the two best spots
[44:34] to hear more about what I'm working on
[44:36] if you're a startup please reach out to
[44:38] asymmetric we'd love to hear from you
[44:39] I'm we love to we've taken a look at
[44:41] quite a few companies in this space and
[44:42] we're actively deploying and then um you
[44:45] know if you have something particular
[44:47] you'd like to ask me it's contact at Dan
[44:48] hill.com as my email amazing thank you
[44:51] so much and now we have the last end
[44:52] routine where the previous guest is
[44:54] asking a question for the next guest so
[44:56] the last question of uh the podcast uh
[44:58] and it's it's a popular it's a popular
[45:01] question on the podcast um what does
[45:03] freedom actually mean for you yeah
[45:05] that's a that's a really good question
[45:07] um I think freedom for me would both be
[45:09] in two functions one is bodily freedom
[45:11] and then one is monetary Freedom so
[45:13] bodily Freedom would be the ability to
[45:15] do whatever I want with my with my body
[45:18] um this includes all-encompassing things
[45:20] like legalization of drugs uh birth
[45:23] control uh abortion assisted suicide
[45:28] you have do I I can choose if I want to
[45:30] use take the covid vaccine or not um
[45:33] it's a full expression of my bodily
[45:35] autonomy that would be one also things
[45:37] like gun control uh to be able to own a
[45:39] weapon I think is a critical aspect of
[45:41] autonomy over your body if you don't
[45:43] have a weapon to defend your body then
[45:45] how do you have autonomy over it you
[45:46] don't so self-defense is a critical
[45:49] point of bodily autonomy so that's
[45:51] Freedom that's one aspect of freedom to
[45:53] me the other one is monetary so monetary
[45:54] Freedom would be that I can do whatever
[45:57] I want with my money and there's no one
[45:58] in the way so I can buy be buying
[46:01] investing saving uh there's no friction
[46:04] points added to where I'm restricted in
[46:06] my ability to perform to save own
[46:09] transmit and uh my money and to engage
[46:11] in Commerce so that would be so Ultra
[46:14] capitalist would be kind of that that
[46:16] framing of a pure capitalist system with
[46:18] no government oversight at all that
[46:20] would be freedom to
[46:21] me I love it I lack that answer a lot um
[46:25] perfect and thank you so much for for
[46:26] for being on you already said uh where
[46:28] people can can find you and thank you
[46:30] for taking the time also thank you for
[46:32] everyone watching and listening uh for
[46:34] joining us today as always I'll be back
[46:36] tomorrow byebye
