[00:00] either you stay in The Matrix or you get
[00:03] out and end up creating your own itco
[00:05] becomes 50% of everything we're actually
[00:07] spawning a new intelligence in form of
[00:09] AI it is a freedom money for those who
[00:11] are trying to get out of the the Fiat
[00:14] system this Bitcoin in a sense the
[00:17] connection between the physical and
[00:19] digital
[00:21] realm yeah I I think so what I believe
[00:25] like one of the notes I added to my prep
[00:28] after I sent them to you um I realiz
[00:33] that ideas come in waves and some ideas
[00:38] stack on top of each other to make
[00:40] bigger
[00:41] waves and I feel like right now where
[00:45] like where we are in in life right now
[00:48] is at a Crossroads or like um there's a
[00:51] wave pattern that is
[00:53] intersecting and so there's going to be
[00:56] this time where there two waves coming
[00:58] into each other they're going to
[01:01] overlap and you're if you're a surfer on
[01:05] that wave if you're right in the middle
[01:07] you're going to get launched straight up
[01:10] because like the two peaks make one
[01:13] bigger Peak um or you can choose to get
[01:18] on either two sides of the Waves so if
[01:22] you're on the the top on this side you
[01:26] could transition to this wave and stay
[01:30] going this way or you could through that
[01:35] intersection get on to the other wave on
[01:38] the other
[01:39] side but after that split
[01:44] happens after you've gone past that
[01:46] initial split point it's hard to go
[01:49] back because then you have to go back to
[01:53] the vocal point to basically like um be
[01:55] in the crashing wave and that is like
[01:58] the the Fiat world and the Bitcoin world
[02:00] are um intersecting right now there's
[02:04] there's a time for people to to choose
[02:08] um the longer they don't choose uh the
[02:12] further we're simply going to be in in
[02:15] time and both ways will probably
[02:18] slightly
[02:20] disappear I mean we have now um with
[02:24] with the fat world that comes in and the
[02:27] we are kind of in a messy place right
[02:29] now I think like when we have feared
[02:31] currencies I don't know how many are
[02:33] there 100 60 or something I don't know a
[02:36] lot of fear currencies we have uh we
[02:39] even have like the the US dollars with a
[02:41] really dominant side but we also have
[02:43] the Europe and in in China and different
[02:45] field currencies going on so we are far
[02:48] away from like a singularity standpoint
[02:51] from like we where we have one unit of
[02:53] account where we have one base layer of
[02:56] of our financial system and I'm really
[02:58] big on this this base layer idea I
[03:01] really think that Bitcoin will be the
[03:04] base layer of our financial system and
[03:06] of of our uh human beings then because
[03:09] whenever you have a transaction with
[03:11] someone else 50% of that transaction if
[03:14] it's not B it's money like of course you
[03:17] can exchange uh like I don't know an
[03:20] keyboard for a mouse something like that
[03:23] uh you have two keyboards and the other
[03:25] one has two mouses uh but uh in most
[03:29] situation it's more efficient to
[03:31] exchange with money so if Bitcoin
[03:34] becomes 50% of everything um and you
[03:37] talked about this this this vocal points
[03:39] and this this this waves clashing right
[03:42] now with the Fiat world and and the
[03:44] Bitcoin World um let's let's before we
[03:47] get into how the world then looks uh uh
[03:50] when when we are this in this in this
[03:52] Bitcoin world and what this could be
[03:55] when we are like in the singularity of
[03:57] Bitcoin how do we get there like how do
[03:59] you uh what do you imagine happening
[04:03] before we get there when we have this
[04:05] clashing point where you also said
[04:07] there's a lot lot happening I feel like
[04:09] we are still in the early days where
[04:11] this clashing point is not there how how
[04:14] do you how do you see this coming or
[04:16] what do you foresee
[04:19] coming it all depends on a choice really
[04:22] and I think that's a choice each and
[04:23] everyone of us has to has to make um
[04:30] it's um almost like The
[04:33] Shakespearean uh to be or not to
[04:37] be so the the two ways represent in my
[04:42] opinion uh two potential ways for
[04:46] Consciousness to
[04:48] continue so the the Dig Digital
[04:52] World
[04:54] um we're we're we're spawning and and
[04:58] we're actually spawning and and and new
[05:00] intelligence uh in the form of
[05:03] AI and um the the cycle that that leads
[05:07] to is all all the information that we um
[05:13] living uh whatever living actually means
[05:16] um living
[05:18] consciousnesses um like the carbon side
[05:21] of things yeah so the we we store our
[05:26] Consciousness in in the stories we tell
[05:28] each other and um in the the carbon
[05:33] based World um we have kids and we
[05:36] explain the world to them and they
[05:39] imagine then the new world that we all
[05:41] live in and they do to their children so
[05:44] that's that's one uh loop to be in uh
[05:48] that is stable on its own um it's always
[05:52] if you transition over to we're going to
[05:55] store all the
[05:58] stories then from that storage of
[06:03] stories you can create an AI algorithm
[06:07] that is sort of the an imprint of this
[06:12] side which effectively if you look at
[06:15] what in the movie The Matrix what that
[06:18] actually is um a digital version of the
[06:22] the world that we live in um that's
[06:25] based off of a copy of what people
[06:27] thought uh at some point in the past
[06:31] and
[06:33] um kids that grow up start from being
[06:36] unconscious and taking in a lot of
[06:38] information and then becoming
[06:41] conscious and an AI model language based
[06:44] or like with visual inputs does the same
[06:47] thing but they're the the base layer
[06:51] silicon basically and the um well the
[06:57] hum are the reality sit that we think is
[06:59] reality or Bas reality is the more is
[07:02] the carbon based one
[07:06] and um they cycle into each
[07:10] other at this focal
[07:13] point and is it possible that we like
[07:17] because you uh Matrix is a really nice
[07:20] movie and I feel like that that's that's
[07:23] inofficial kind of a Bitcoin movie that
[07:26] everybody accept as the Bitcoin movie
[07:28] even though it hasn't nothing to do with
[07:31] finances really and nothing to do with
[07:33] with Bitcoin really I mean has a lot to
[07:36] do with Bitcoin and and and finances if
[07:37] you look closer but in on the surface if
[07:39] someone watches it they not immediately
[07:42] thinking of Bitcoin H only if you have
[07:45] the Bitcoin thing then you're thinking
[07:47] of Bitcoin is it like is that that Fiat
[07:50] system the The Matrix and could or could
[07:52] it be that we actually live in kind of a
[07:55] matrix um either you stay in The Matrix
[08:00] or you get out and end up creating your
[08:04] own
[08:06] um so if you if you like sort of the
[08:09] Matrix is uh a set of rules that we live
[08:14] by and whether that is uh initially set
[08:18] up by some kind of superc computer uh
[08:21] that imposes uh the rules of the
[08:23] programming or whether that is uh
[08:27] basically culture or history
[08:31] um effective for the people who are
[08:33] living it doesn't matter because they
[08:35] they they grow up within a system that
[08:38] um provides the rules for them that is
[08:41] either childhood or early adolescence um
[08:45] or that is figuring out what the Matrix
[08:49] is and then realizing that you're in it
[08:53] um that's basically the the same thing
[08:56] uh learning about history and learning
[08:59] about like how uh how the world got to
[09:02] be and how people are um that is the
[09:05] same thing as learning about
[09:07] matrix it's the The Matrix is the world
[09:09] the world model you have and trying to
[09:13] step out is letting go of what you
[09:17] thought you
[09:18] knew and um letting go of a lot of
[09:22] people that you knew of course and
[09:24] stepping into basically a parallel
[09:27] universe uh where you get to reimagine
[09:30] things um but those those M those things
[09:35] that you imagine there will form the
[09:37] Matrix that is there um because in a way
[09:41] you you live
[09:44] in you live in the in the world model
[09:47] that you create for
[09:48] yourself and then in that way the idea
[09:51] of manifestation really works as
[09:54] well uh saying that whatever you believe
[09:57] about the world to be true you end up
[09:59] creating in the
[10:01] world and that that that goes
[10:05] for for for all good things and all bad
[10:08] things
[10:09] probably and maybe that's that's why a
[10:12] lot of uh people before us have have
[10:16] said Love Is The
[10:18] Answer um Love is definitely answer my
[10:22] third or fourth podcast was a guy who
[10:25] said Bitcoin is actually love because
[10:27] it's a system based on on trust trust
[10:29] and a system based on on truth and
[10:32] integrity uh but let's
[10:35] uh let's let's focus maybe on how this
[10:38] Matrix uh that we are creating and it's
[10:41] fascinating that we we it's a nice
[10:43] thought that you to have that there
[10:46] there's there's always a matrix there
[10:48] like always a set of rules uh and you
[10:51] can adopt your set of rules and
[10:54] obviously fear set of rules are not so
[10:58] good for for the individual we have a
[11:01] lot of uh imposing uh things they steal
[11:05] for inflation they impose Financial
[11:08] monitoring like they impose surveillance
[11:10] a lot which Al also is a big part uh
[11:15] especially when now more and more is
[11:17] digital uh then it's really interesting
[11:19] because Bitcoin is digital only uh but
[11:23] respects those those those individual
[11:25] rights better than than other uh as
[11:29] digital assets like the E Euro the E the
[11:33] fcoin whatever is is is coming um how do
[11:36] you how do you see that when when we
[11:38] adopt all the the Bitcoin uh things and
[11:41] and we we kind of agree on on bitcoin as
[11:44] the singularity and we actually do this
[11:46] as a as a
[11:47] Humanity what do you think will will
[11:50] change especially also on those
[11:52] financial inclusion privacy yeah all the
[11:56] topics because of the similarities
[11:59] between between languages it is also
[12:01] creating sort of the the base layer of
[12:04] communication re like all those
[12:08] languages human and animal share share
[12:11] structure uh that structure is sort of
[12:14] the the core of reality that we live in
[12:16] the the common
[12:19] denominator of of beliefs that people
[12:22] have um there so like beliefs like there
[12:25] are something like up there are
[12:27] something like down uh there's something
[12:29] like left right like these are
[12:32] the the world that we live in is sort of
[12:35] based
[12:36] of what we as a collective
[12:40] believe and if if you're in a
[12:44] dream why why at some point if you have
[12:47] lucid dreams you can control that dream
[12:49] almost
[12:50] completely and be really really intense
[12:53] in it um the main difference between
[12:56] awake time and a dream time
[13:00] is how many other Consciousness are you
[13:03] sharing your dream with and in in in
[13:07] your personal dream when you're sleeping
[13:09] you have full
[13:11] control of that dream therefore you
[13:14] basically in that tiny sphere you get to
[13:17] be God and have all all the influence
[13:21] but if you're in the the collective
[13:26] dream then whatever becomes reality is
[13:29] sort of the the common denominator of
[13:32] all those dreams of all those people
[13:34] combined and that's what we experience
[13:36] as reality and in in a
[13:40] way Bitcoin is
[13:45] um massively well literally
[13:50] electrifying um that process is so sort
[13:53] of the the
[13:55] spark um basically in between those two
[13:58] hands uh in the back um that's where we
[14:04] humans
[14:06] realize um our sovereignty and our
[14:10] creative
[14:12] potential
[14:13] and
[14:15] what but the Fiat world does is it
[14:20] extracts that
[14:22] energy and gives it and like drains it
[14:26] in some way and the um AI technological
[14:30] world will do that in in a similar
[14:33] way but on a different level um the the
[14:38] theat world will more
[14:40] extract um both both will extract your
[14:43] time in a way U because you have to be
[14:46] in reality and spend your time there or
[14:48] you can be online and spend your time
[14:50] there and you're you're going to fuel
[14:53] either of these two systems
[14:57] and at some point there's going to
[15:00] be the the longer those two waves uh
[15:04] they're going going be intersecting for
[15:07] quite a long time um
[15:11] and it's it's it's actually like surfing
[15:14] like you got to try to right the edge um
[15:17] and not fall off off the
[15:20] back or get stuck into into the crash in
[15:23] the middle
[15:26] um I think the the world is just going
[15:29] to a really exciting uh period and the
[15:34] on either which side of that divide
[15:35] you're going to be you're going to be
[15:37] either more focused on uh anonymity I
[15:40] think that's the more the the digital
[15:42] world or there's there's two kinds of
[15:45] anonymity like in the real world you
[15:47] when you introduce yourself to someone
[15:49] there is massive
[15:51] anonymity uh Because unless you're
[15:54] really well known um and being really
[15:57] well known in a small community
[15:59] is really quite different than being
[16:01] well really well known through the
[16:02] amplifier that is the
[16:04] internet um so sort of what the the
[16:08] internet does is it
[16:11] amplifies the in the rate of exchange of
[16:15] information
[16:16] massively um like me being able to talk
[16:19] to you now and ex and exchange that
[16:23] information um Can can only be done at
[16:27] this rate through the
[16:29] internet um it's a step function in how
[16:34] much more information is being exchanged
[16:37] compared to like a thousand years ago so
[16:41] and it also matches with like the rate
[16:42] of
[16:43] progress like the faster information is
[16:47] exchanged um more ideas will be mixed
[16:51] and faster new ideas
[16:54] will will come to the surface because
[16:57] they're simply
[17:00] um multiple Bubbles at our ideas that
[17:03] collapse onto each other create one
[17:05] bigger bubble that's going to be rising
[17:07] faster than the bubbles around them um
[17:09] but eventually all the
[17:11] bubbles um will burst and you'll get the
[17:16] the the end sort of that entropy unless
[17:18] you find something that shakes things up
[17:22] quite a bit and
[17:25] um there's there's many many different
[17:28] ways that is going to happen in in the
[17:32] future um but we also need like the the
[17:35] mixups because as soon as everything
[17:39] gets to a steady
[17:40] state um then there's no real
[17:43] interesting interaction happening it's
[17:46] like having like a glass of water with
[17:48] oil on
[17:49] top um if there's just water and
[17:53] oil and you leave it be there's nothing
[17:56] really interesting happening but if you
[17:58] start mixing it up real well then for a
[18:01] while there's going to be a lot of
[18:05] interaction and is that interaction that
[18:07] is interesting but it's also basically
[18:09] the interaction between
[18:11] people um exchanging
[18:14] information um I go here you go there
[18:17] why this that the other
[18:19] um but that's just if you have like two
[18:22] liquids water and oil but the the more
[18:25] different stuff you start adding to it
[18:28] um the more complexity there gets to
[18:31] be and the more different kinds of
[18:34] experiences there get to be like it's um
[18:38] like maybe like 20 years ago there was
[18:42] this this game I played online where you
[18:45] were initially given like the four four
[18:49] base uh
[18:51] substances and by selecting them you
[18:54] could recombine them into something new
[18:56] and they could recombine something else
[18:58] create something new again and basically
[19:00] that's what we're what we've been doing
[19:02] as as humans
[19:04] recombining things that we understand in
[19:07] in novel ways um and sometimes rarely uh
[19:12] come up with something new it's it's the
[19:17] ideas so this this is sort of the idea
[19:20] of I've been playing with what if the
[19:23] world that we get to
[19:25] experience is um created by the ideas
[19:30] that were able to explain thoroughly
[19:33] enough that other people get to believe
[19:37] that that reality could be true so take
[19:41] the the thought experience that Albert
[19:43] Einstein did that led him
[19:46] to finding the equation for
[19:50] Trans from transition from energy to
[19:55] matter that created the idea for it for
[19:59] for the atom bomb and for nuclear energy
[20:01] and all that
[20:05] um and whole new sort of Paradigm of
[20:08] world of being opened up stemming from
[20:11] that single
[20:13] idea and I think Bitcoin is an idea on
[20:18] the on that same
[20:20] level it
[20:22] is saying how could we store
[20:27] energy and trans MIT Energy across vast
[20:31] distances and time um without
[20:36] involving
[20:38] um physical Goods basically in the in
[20:41] the inter in their in the trans in the
[20:44] uh in the exchange of that energy like
[20:47] the medium is uh with Bitcoin is
[20:51] technology um but the thing that's
[20:53] actually exchanged is mostly
[20:57] information and
[21:00] and that's a a new sort of base layer in
[21:04] a way for for
[21:07] Consciousness we'll see what happens
[21:09] it's
[21:10] it's it's a fascinating thought I never
[21:13] thought it that way uh I see Bitcoin in
[21:17] a lot of different ways they with you um
[21:21] which also the thought that I also had
[21:24] when we have uh the concept of creating
[21:28] value
[21:29] uh in creating something uh it's it's
[21:32] fascinating to see the the the
[21:34] difference between the digital and the
[21:35] Physical Realm and the interconnection
[21:38] between those uh and especially the
[21:41] dream example was also quite quite nice
[21:45] of of you when we all collecting
[21:48] collectively dream of
[21:50] something uh and this more and more
[21:53] people start streaming of
[21:55] Bitcoin uh and and first this was like
[21:58] just one guy Satoshi and then he dreamed
[22:00] of Bitcoin it could be
[22:03] something then there was like halfin and
[22:05] there like more and more people coming
[22:07] into the scene of of dreaming about
[22:09] Bitcoin and then like only shortly
[22:13] after uh sad like only shortly after
[22:18] Bitcoin was uh created sad Nakamoto um
[22:23] left died whatever uh but he's not there
[22:26] anymore he doesn't support it anymore
[22:28] like the first one that has a dream is
[22:32] really quickly gone usually when someone
[22:34] has a dream he has to really be
[22:37] hardworking to keep the dream alive if I
[22:40] for example stop that
[22:42] podcast there will be no Robin S podcast
[22:45] tomorrow because yeah nobody else will
[22:49] uh make another Robin S podcast I mean
[22:52] there there will be not a Bitcoin
[22:54] podcast that will maybe have a similar
[22:57] thing but it will not be the the same
[22:59] thing if you build a company you have to
[23:01] really work hard to to keep that thing
[23:04] alive um long term and maybe you are
[23:08] able to create something great so so big
[23:11] that it
[23:12] lives beyond yourself like Steve Jobs
[23:16] made with apple but you had work a lot
[23:18] and there were a lot of people already
[23:20] involved when he died uh and they had
[23:23] invested interest in in Bitcoin it was
[23:25] like it was really soon when he went
[23:29] like really really soon it's fascinating
[23:32] that the Tre transferred to all the
[23:34] physical uh
[23:36] beings um yeah it's just just just a
[23:39] thought that I had in in my mind when
[23:41] when when you talked about uh Bitcoin
[23:44] for me the the topic that I want to now
[23:46] get is like creating value because to
[23:50] easy these days to destroy something
[23:54] like there's an old building destroyed
[23:56] and there's a new modern building coming
[23:58] up that looks way uglier than before uh
[24:01] then there's like oh we got it with the
[24:05] I don't want to get get into politics
[24:07] but there was this this uh movement
[24:09] where they in Europe they they threw
[24:11] orange things on on beautiful paintings
[24:13] even like cut it sometimes and stuff
[24:15] like that this is those are amazing
[24:19] artworks that took long long times and
[24:23] really a lot pent uh and and they they
[24:27] put a lot of work into artwork and then
[24:29] it got just deleted in
[24:32] seconds which I thought now is like when
[24:35] we have Bitcoin could that change how we
[24:39] create value because all of a sudden we
[24:43] we are not in this feared thing where
[24:45] value seems to be not of value like
[24:49] everything that we're doing right now is
[24:51] like ah we we can just replace it
[24:53] tomorrow that there's no long
[24:55] longlasting thing these days but when we
[24:58] exchange them Bas layer could that CH or
[25:02] in what way changes that things yeah I
[25:04] think that the the Fiat model um works
[25:08] as a sort of as a
[25:10] religion uh like people sometimes say
[25:13] about Christianity that it's a uh the
[25:17] opioid for the masses to like as a way
[25:21] to distract people from the fact that
[25:22] they're going to die at some point and
[25:26] um that that allows people to say
[25:30] unconscious um but having to reckon with
[25:34] the idea that you're are going to die at
[25:36] some point into the future um put so
[25:40] much more emphasis on the
[25:42] now um because it makes you realize that
[25:45] you can't nothing's going to happen
[25:48] nothing in the past you can change and
[25:51] nothing in the future um is is going to
[25:54] matter more than now um
[25:59] and I think that what what
[26:01] Bitcoin uh does because it um so
[26:07] elegantly um ties time to value and the
[26:14] um Sovereign like The Sovereign exchange
[26:16] of value created um I think is the sort
[26:20] of a keystone to
[26:23] the the whole um basically the whole
[26:27] value hierarchy
[26:31] um like in in the Fiat model um because
[26:34] of like all the interactions that um
[26:38] International Banks and stuff that like
[26:41] what people are and that spawns sort of
[26:45] the the
[26:46] news and advertising because it that
[26:50] need that system needs to be propped up
[26:52] prop up prop up
[26:54] um but it's a system that is based on a
[26:58] lack of self- sovereignty it is putting
[27:01] something above uh everything else in
[27:04] that case um the the money that the Fiat
[27:09] money
[27:11] um then in Bitcoin it is like for now
[27:14] it's an
[27:15] optin um it is a freedom money for those
[27:19] who are trying to get out of the the
[27:21] Fiat system
[27:23] um like I said for for our children uh
[27:27] if if coin is uh successful um Bitcoin
[27:31] is going to be their Fiat
[27:34] money because they've never experienced
[27:39] money they can
[27:41] choose uh so they'll see Bitcoin as Fiat
[27:46] because uh the parents say it is money
[27:49] and um in a way uh Bitcoin is uh Rock
[27:54] pulling the the Fiat World um and
[28:00] I presume that at some point in the
[28:02] future our children are going to be Rock
[28:06] pulling every everyone every adult who
[28:09] is um no longer awake enough to uh get
[28:15] with the
[28:17] times um and I think it's it's conscious
[28:21] adults that are um humble enough to
[28:25] listen to the
[28:29] children um that are going to
[28:32] succeed like people are like you said
[28:36] the idea of um if you decide not to do
[28:39] the Roman s podcast anymore there's not
[28:42] going to be a romaner
[28:44] podcast and
[28:48] the the world that other people get to
[28:52] experience is created by the few people
[28:55] who uh are actually creating the
[28:57] experience
[28:59] es and I think the beautiful thing about
[29:02] the about Bitcoin is it
[29:06] um it's
[29:09] rewarding uh in an really elegant
[29:12] way those who are
[29:15] creating uh the the experiences others
[29:18] get to have um whilst it's almost like a
[29:23] rising tide lifts all
[29:25] boats um that that does what uh what
[29:29] Bitcoin feels like to me uh because it
[29:32] is uh reducing the cost of anything to
[29:37] the marginal cost of
[29:38] production uh which means that if you do
[29:41] work for a set amount of value in the
[29:45] now um over time because the the people
[29:51] just get better at doing stuff um that
[29:54] is going to be more valuable into the
[29:56] future and if you just like
[30:00] um a an honest system because if I add
[30:06] something positive to you your life now
[30:08] or you you to
[30:10] mine um that is going to have a ripple
[30:14] effect into my future that if that um
[30:18] that nudge that you got of me or I got
[30:21] of you is a positive one let's assume it
[30:25] is um well
[30:28] well that's all we can do right
[30:31] um is the earlier I get in time I get
[30:34] that nudge the more valuable it's going
[30:37] to be to me to get that nudge so me
[30:40] paying you in Bitcoin is going to
[30:44] reflect the fact that if I pay that now
[30:46] and bitcoin's value grows over time that
[30:50] the earlier
[30:51] I've uh spend that time with you spend
[30:54] my Bitcoin my time with you um the
[30:58] better because the growth starts
[31:01] happening
[31:02] earlier whereas if you delay that moment
[31:05] longer longer and longer
[31:08] um you you start um compounding simply
[31:14] later it it seems like value that can be
[31:17] created out of the interactions that you
[31:19] have with the people around you if you
[31:20] are listening to this podcast you might
[31:22] be wondering what is actually the setup
[31:24] look like of Robin or how can I improve
[31:27] my Bitcoin setup and there's two things
[31:29] you have to buy Bitcoin from the right
[31:31] source and you have to store Bitcoin the
[31:33] right way let's focus on the first thing
[31:36] how to buy Bitcoin it's simple have a
[31:38] Bitcoin only exchange don't deal with
[31:40] the shitcoin exchanges don't deal with
[31:42] an exchange that has an own token or
[31:44] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[31:47] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[31:50] for me the best partner for that and now
[31:53] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[31:55] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[31:57] a self custody solution where you
[32:01] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[32:03] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[32:07] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[32:09] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[32:12] fras and you are better than 95% of all
[32:16] Bitcoin hodlers if you have more than
[32:18] ,000 in Bitcoin it's a absolutely must
[32:21] have one last thing before we get back
[32:23] to the video I'm really passionate about
[32:25] meeting other bitcoiners and that an
[32:28] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[32:31] in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's
[32:34] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[32:37] conference in whole of Europe for all
[32:39] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[32:41] this place in June for all europees it's
[32:44] a must go anyways you're so close to the
[32:47] Bitcoin PR conference you basically have
[32:49] to come I will do interviews there and I
[32:51] would love to meet you all there use
[32:54] code Robin for all my sponsors to get
[32:57] this accounts and use the links down in
[32:59] the description absolutely and it it
[33:02] seems like Bitcoin and time is so
[33:04] interconnected these days like it will
[33:07] be even more interconnected once Bitcoin
[33:10] uh
[33:11] and and it's funny how how we can look
[33:15] at at Bitcoin even as it would have it
[33:18] would be time um you sent me some things
[33:22] that you you might want to talk about
[33:24] before and you put not only date from
[33:28] day you put also the time chain uh on on
[33:31] there which is for me fascinating that
[33:34] more and more bitcoiners are actually
[33:36] adopting this kind
[33:37] of time chain uh thing there are even
[33:40] people that when they get married they
[33:43] uh write the block when they got married
[33:46] on their wedding ring which is a
[33:48] fascinating time concept uh and and I if
[33:53] if I orange bu my my girlfriend enough I
[33:56] I might also consider doing
[33:58] uh if if if she's okay with that um
[34:02] we'll be will see um but
[34:05] is if if if the value the most valuable
[34:08] thing humans have is time and second to
[34:12] that I think it's like Bitcoin uh is is
[34:15] the interconnection on the time chain
[34:18] with Bitcoin just just a matter of time
[34:21] come
[34:23] again it was a lot of times but uh when
[34:26] when you have Bitcoin and time being the
[34:29] most valuable like for me is time is the
[34:31] most valuable thing and time is like the
[34:34] highest thing that you can exchange for
[34:37] something uh that's why when when you
[34:40] say oh I I I give time uh to my family I
[34:44] give time to to people I L is actually
[34:48] something meaningful and it it's way
[34:50] more valuable than an actual gift like
[34:53] if you have like some some gift that you
[34:55] thought of and then a give and that's
[34:57] why I think all people value gifts that
[35:01] come from the heart more than just
[35:03] material things that you just bought
[35:04] from some random store yeah when you
[35:06] make it yourself or it's really
[35:08] thoughtful because they know you thought
[35:11] about that you spend time on that gift
[35:13] you spend love you spend love you spend
[35:16] time on there uh and it's more valuable
[35:19] um when you have not his fault okay we
[35:21] have time it's really valuable and then
[35:23] we have Bitcoin that kind of represents
[35:26] time and yours like made the time chain
[35:29] can this actually happen that Bitcoin
[35:33] not only exchanges the the unit of
[35:36] account and store value but also
[35:37] exchanges our time system like that the
[35:40] time the to be
[35:43] yeah well
[35:48] um if the idea is true that um we live
[35:54] in our imag our Collective imagination
[35:59] um
[36:00] then what is sort of the the cycle of uh
[36:04] imagining what this world is like so
[36:06] when you first become conscious you
[36:09] start seeing like differences between
[36:11] light and dark um then like sound no
[36:16] sound
[36:17] um and maybe when you're tler you start
[36:21] learning about like up down uh above
[36:25] over top like you're You're Building
[36:28] um a world
[36:30] model and initially when you when you
[36:33] when people first become conscious they
[36:36] they are the center of the
[36:39] universe um because everything they
[36:42] know is all there is
[36:47] basically
[36:48] um and then people by this even like the
[36:53] simple game of
[36:55] peekaboo um we get introduced to the
[36:58] idea of uh object
[37:02] permanence that's basically where time
[37:06] starts
[37:07] um
[37:09] and we initially live on like a 2d
[37:13] plane uh when we're like when we're
[37:16] maybe we're able to roll like when we're
[37:18] like still like really really small
[37:20] we're in a 2d plane where we have an
[37:22] ability to roll slightly popping to like
[37:25] the third dimension uh then at some
[37:28] point we we start standing up or start
[37:30] moving around we start exploring like
[37:33] actually moving in this first 2D in a 3D
[37:36] World
[37:38] um
[37:40] but the the concept of time and days
[37:45] passing that is there there's been some
[37:48] experience with people like going to a
[37:50] cave and then like um going to bed and
[37:56] going sleeping when when they feel like
[37:58] it that leads for each person to a
[38:01] slightly different natural Rhythm and I
[38:04] think the um the the reason why sort of
[38:08] the the Earth keeps rotating in a way
[38:13] is
[38:14] imagine we you start off with a with a
[38:17] world where there is where you actually
[38:19] have a flat Earth and each individual on
[38:22] that flat initially thought of as flat
[38:25] plane thinks that they're the center of
[38:26] the universe
[38:28] because we'll grow up that way um or at
[38:32] least if our parents are really car
[38:35] caring or nurturing then we we
[38:37] experience being the center of the
[38:38] universe uh but add a lot of dots
[38:42] together that all think that they're at
[38:43] the center of the universe the only way
[38:45] to there's a couple ways to solve that
[38:47] because each dot is going to be an equal
[38:50] distance sort of away from everything
[38:51] else um and a way to solve that is
[38:54] simply to make a sphere because that way
[38:56] each dot is the center of the
[38:58] universe at least to
[39:00] them
[39:02] um but if everyone has their own like
[39:05] sleep W
[39:06] cycle
[39:08] um it's hard to do stuff
[39:11] together so the only way to like be able
[39:14] to like interact often with with people
[39:17] is to make sure that you're awake at the
[39:19] same time and that you're sleeping at
[39:21] the same time well people get
[39:25] to small cluster that syn up their uh
[39:30] sleep wake
[39:32] cycle and that's going to spread like
[39:36] like uh ink
[39:39] blobs because you got to choose you want
[39:42] you want to be awake when other people
[39:45] are also awake otherwise there's nothing
[39:47] happening you're all by your own
[39:50] and that will start forming a wave
[39:54] around that circle around that sphere
[39:57] that was simply created by the fact that
[39:59] we all think they were at center of the
[40:02] universe and now all of a sudden we have
[40:05] created from our own imagination a day
[40:08] night cycle that works for everyone on
[40:11] that on the sphere because everyone
[40:13] stinks up to the common denominator in
[40:17] terms of uh what the the natural rate
[40:20] should
[40:21] be so in a
[40:25] way we imagine the Earth to be as a
[40:28] collective and then we get to inhabit it
[40:30] and it is the people who are imaginative
[40:33] enough to think of new ways of being and
[40:37] actually creating them uh is that the
[40:39] world that we get to experience actually
[40:41] gets to
[40:44] be wow that's it's a big concept and
[40:48] it's uh I feel like we we're talking uh
[40:52] deep but I think we are also scratching
[40:54] the surface on this yes it's fascinating
[40:58] to to to think about those those things
[41:01] um as you're coming already closer to
[41:03] the to the one hour mark uh and there
[41:06] are so many more questions I I want to
[41:08] get in but I guess uh it's time it's
[41:12] it's it's uh uh it's also fair to like
[41:15] make at some point a second round to
[41:18] that but there are some things that I I
[41:20] want to get into uh before we ended um
[41:24] you mentioned in one uh tweet uh a a guy
[41:30] that I never heard of before so I was
[41:32] like curious and I just quickly Googled
[41:34] him uh Alexander
[41:37] sensy yeah ssen um and you like kind of
[41:43] made the the comparison uh to to satosi
[41:47] Nakamoto first of all who who is he and
[41:50] how how does he relate just uh okay yeah
[41:53] so
[41:55] Alexander um I may have some my wrong
[41:57] here so give me but the general prise
[42:00] will be will be okay um was a writer in
[42:06] uh Soviet Russia and um he is uh he he
[42:11] wrote a book the gulag
[42:14] archipelago uh which was about the of
[42:18] the war camps that were erected in
[42:20] Soviet Russia
[42:23] um during well during death period uh
[42:27] and um a period
[42:30] where people had to conform their speech
[42:33] to to the collective in order to survive
[42:37] basically um in a way similar to what we
[42:40] have now um like in the in that period
[42:43] as well as
[42:45] in U
[42:47] occupied Germany
[42:50] um you had just a lot of people like
[42:53] informing on each other and um
[43:00] the the message that from the Soviet
[43:02] Union towards the rest of the world was
[43:06] we've ushered in the Utopia and uh look
[43:08] at us it's we're doing so great but on
[43:11] the inside it was uh well repression and
[43:16] uh
[43:18] control
[43:19] and what his book has has done
[43:25] is he was in his book he simply well
[43:29] simply he wrote about all the uh
[43:33] omnition omnition of truth and the
[43:35] distortions of reality
[43:38] that each and everyone in that
[43:41] Nation
[43:43] um got involved with that would create
[43:47] the system that they all hated together
[43:50] because they weren't allowed
[43:52] to um
[43:57] because because they had ushered in the
[43:59] the
[44:01] Utopia um saying that you were hurt in
[44:04] some way uh was not allowed because how
[44:08] can you be hurting when you're living in
[44:11] the Utopia but there has to be something
[44:13] wrong with you because there cannot be
[44:15] something wrong with the Utopia that
[44:16] we've
[44:17] created um so in order to keep the that
[44:21] false Utopia alive uh the Utopia had to
[44:25] sacrifice people
[44:28] um
[44:30] and that book is basically a massive
[44:33] like I don't know even know how many
[44:35] pages that is but it's
[44:37] a so many thousand page scream I think
[44:41] I'm paraphrasing this from Jordan
[44:43] Peterson like a 400 page stream about
[44:47] what was going on
[44:50] and I in a way I relate that to Sosi
[44:53] Nakamoto with the white paper and um
[44:58] both these
[44:59] individuals
[45:01] um created a
[45:04] signal or a
[45:05] lens through which to see uh the world
[45:09] they were
[45:11] experiencing
[45:13] and in Alexander Sol nen's case that led
[45:18] to the fall
[45:19] of the Soviet
[45:22] Russia um and in our time
[45:27] uh the introduction of the the Bitcoin
[45:30] protocol um could be the the end of Fiat
[45:35] money and both
[45:38] are about introducing reintroducing
[45:42] honesty in Sol Soul's book he sort of
[45:46] realized that it is all the lies that
[45:49] people tell
[45:51] themselves about what is good instead of
[45:55] uh looking towards themselves fix
[45:57] themselves that
[46:01] allows that sort of tyranny to come to
[46:05] be and as soon as people are willing
[46:09] to um seek the problems in the world in
[46:13] themselves instead of in
[46:15] others um we start and that is
[46:19] basically the appe of um sovereignty I'd
[46:25] say saying that
[46:27] the the world that I experience is is is
[46:31] a result of my actions instead of
[46:34] pointing the
[46:35] finger um but the second you point the
[46:38] finger saying what I experience is your
[46:40] fault then you're also basically saying
[46:43] that um I'm not sovereign you
[46:45] are
[46:47] and so basically the the choice that
[46:50] people are left with is um are they
[46:53] going
[46:55] to take the the path of complaining
[47:00] about the world around them and uh not
[47:03] doing [ __ ] and being unhappy about
[47:07] it to or are they going to choose to um
[47:12] do the work on themselves and like in
[47:15] the in the other world and take
[47:18] responsibility for their lives and
[47:20] actually create a be it's like the
[47:23] believe in the idea that um
[47:27] if people actually put their their
[47:30] energy in the right place we could
[47:32] actually create something
[47:34] beautiful and I'm not saying that we're
[47:36] going to issuing the issue in the Utopia
[47:40] uh because the Utopia is never where you
[47:42] are but also always the place that
[47:45] you're trying to get to and um I think
[47:48] the the correcting mechanism that we
[47:51] humans have create created is children
[47:58] because they're definitely honest and if
[48:01] you're as an adult willing to
[48:05] listen to someone who knows very very
[48:08] very
[48:10] little and um actually trying to make
[48:14] the world you see a better place for
[48:17] those who are coming to be instead of
[48:20] those who
[48:21] are
[48:22] um then I think we uh have a have a
[48:25] chance of creating something immensely
[48:27] beautiful and
[48:29] fulfilling that's uh I think the most
[48:32] beautiful way to to get to our end
[48:36] routine with with those sentences wow I
[48:38] I love it a lot uh and especially also
[48:40] with the Utopia uh I've I have to
[48:43] rewatch this podcast a lot to to fully
[48:45] adest what you're saying it's I I love
[48:47] your ideas and your Deep Thoughts uh
[48:50] it's it's definitely a different episode
[48:52] that we had today uh and and there's a
[48:55] lot to unpack there um before we get to
[48:58] our end routine uh I'm really passionate
[49:00] about uh asking that question um what
[49:04] you are currently passionate about
[49:07] besides uh what we talked about on the
[49:09] podcast like besides the financial
[49:11] system besides uh Bitcoin like is there
[49:15] anything that you're currently uh or
[49:17] recently really passionate about or
[49:19] learning or deep investigating right now
[49:24] um I think I'm a lot about connecting
[49:28] people right now connecting people and
[49:32] ideas um and both
[49:36] setting what I'm trying to align myself
[49:40] with
[49:41] is
[49:44] um sort of the the straight like a path
[49:48] that aligns with having the most amount
[49:51] of
[49:52] people um
[49:54] experiencing a a meaningful
[49:58] a meaningful
[49:59] life and I'm not saying like a life
[50:02] without hardships because I think the
[50:04] hardships definitely part part part of
[50:07] creating that meaning I see my role
[50:10] sometimes just simply be a
[50:12] guide and um it also feels really
[50:17] fulfilling it's the I think it's the
[50:19] most fulfilling thing that you can
[50:22] possibly do is like the the few podcast
[50:27] episodes where people uh comment like a
[50:30] really long feedback where they're
[50:32] saying like oh this this one thing that
[50:35] you said or like this this episode or
[50:37] the thing that the guest said this
[50:39] resonated with me and it it changed that
[50:41] part of my life and stuff like that
[50:43] there's like often really long things
[50:44] coming back uh this one uh comment is
[50:49] for me so much more fulfilling than when
[50:53] a podcast just goes viral and a lot of
[50:56] people like
[50:57] discussing uh meaningless or seemingly
[51:00] meaningless things in the comment
[51:02] section um Al it's just quality over
[51:06] quality yeah it's like that's that
[51:09] that's really cool to to see I mean I
[51:12] I'm kind of on the quantity side with my
[51:14] podcast because do I do it every day but
[51:16] just I'm really passionate about just um
[51:20] speaking with as many people as possible
[51:22] and and getting also outside of my small
[51:25] bubble or at least expand the bble I
[51:29] have me and I can never do that when I
[51:33] have once a week or once a month podcast
[51:38] episode with a a guest that I search
[51:42] nicely
[51:44] because I I I get like two threee
[51:48] requests that from people that want to
[51:50] be on the
[51:52] podcast maybe not weekly but maybe like
[51:55] every week one or something like that it
[51:57] it averages out it gets more and more as
[52:00] as the as the podcast grows and
[52:05] uh and also when you have everyday a
[52:08] podcast you have to not only depend on
[52:11] people asking for podcast I also have to
[52:13] search for people uh but imagine the
[52:16] same thing where I don't have like seven
[52:18] podcasts but just one podcast in a week
[52:21] which is like only one seventh of the
[52:25] the the the the amount then there are
[52:28] not a lot of like then I can really
[52:31] choose my own bubble really narrow it
[52:34] down like I I probably only speak with
[52:36] people I agree with I only speak with
[52:38] people that that I like I only speak
[52:41] with people that seems interesting
[52:44] unless you consciously go the other
[52:47] way like you're already conscious of
[52:49] that risk so you could also um be really
[52:54] selective um but also be selective
[52:57] in picking ideas that you think you
[53:00] don't agree with and not to correct that
[53:03] person but to figuring out um what
[53:07] assumptions in you had to change for
[53:10] their uh perspective to be the more
[53:13] truthful
[53:14] one yeah that's that's that's very true
[53:19] I mean like whether you're whether the
[53:21] path you're on is confirmation bias or
[53:24] actually trying to um
[53:29] nudge yourself towards uh the center
[53:31] position again
[53:33] yeah I guess I guess with with with more
[53:36] episodes it's easier uh because you you
[53:39] you are forced to find more uh and then
[53:43] you research more like to find more
[53:46] guests and uh but if you're conscious
[53:48] about it uh you can do the same thing
[53:51] even if you have just once a month the
[53:53] same thing uh I guess it's just like uh
[53:57] easier for me in my situation because I
[54:00] have forced myself into into this
[54:02] discipliner but let's let's get into the
[54:05] the end routine of of the podcast uh
[54:08] where the the previous guest is asking a
[54:10] question uh for the next guest without
[54:13] knowing who the next guest actually is
[54:15] uh and your question an interesting one
[54:18] uh what would you do to get more women
[54:21] involved in Bitcoin um sometimes I I see
[54:26] uh
[54:28] us people and and men as well men and
[54:31] women as as
[54:33] gardeners if we if we create a beautiful
[54:38] garden um that is nurturing to life then
[54:42] more life will get to that Garden that
[54:45] being all sorts of creatures and the the
[54:50] care we put into the environment that we
[54:53] create um will draw in uh the most
[54:58] amazing creatures and that can
[55:02] be uh a woman creating a really nice
[55:05] space for a man to stubble into and
[55:07] realizing hey this is something that I
[55:10] really want to stay close to um because
[55:13] it's so nurturing but it can also be uh
[55:16] a man
[55:17] creating uh some sort of um beautiful
[55:22] system um that
[55:26] uh some woman uh feels like being really
[55:30] comfortable
[55:31] and
[55:34] and I think the the things that we
[55:36] create
[55:38] attract um what matches with what we
[55:41] have created so if
[55:44] you if you're doing like traditional
[55:47] agriculture uh you create a lot of the
[55:50] same um and that becomes sort of
[55:54] stale um if you put in a lot of effort
[55:56] and and having
[55:58] a a garden is really well taken care of
[56:01] then all sorts of creatures will
[56:04] flourish there and both both are types
[56:08] of
[56:09] abundance one
[56:12] in a sheer
[56:14] number uh of the same thing and the
[56:17] other in
[56:19] um number of different
[56:22] things and I think
[56:24] it's for each every one of us to figure
[56:28] out where on that Spectrum we would like
[56:30] to be how much
[56:32] samess do you want do you are you
[56:34] comfortable with and how much
[56:38] um chaos
[56:40] and uh constantly
[56:45] changing I love that answer uh it's
[56:48] it's if I feel like if if I get an
[56:51] answer from from every guest that ever
[56:53] was on this would have been the most
[56:56] unique
[56:59] one I love the way you think um Before I
[57:03] Let You Go um is there anything you want
[57:05] to add to this today's episode uh and uh
[57:09] where can people if they have questions
[57:11] to what we talked about where can people
[57:14] uh find you in in the best way or ask
[57:16] you questions in the best way yeah
[57:20] um last bit first uh people could find
[57:23] me on Twitter or uh Noster
[57:27] um I'll I'll share the handles with you
[57:29] so you can add them in if you want to
[57:33] and anything I'd like to add to the
[57:36] conversation um I just want to say thank
[57:39] you for for hosting and um one one
[57:43] question that I maybe want to ask you or
[57:45] you could ask to to the next person is
[57:49] um what's the what's the definition of
[57:52] done
[57:56] like the world done then it's that it's
[57:58] finished or yeah and like one of the
[58:02] notes I I made is like people are always
[58:06] um talking about the
[58:08] revolution um and in a way that's what
[58:12] people are doing with Bitcoin now as
[58:14] well um but the the more important stuff
[58:19] it's not the revolution itself is what
[58:21] comes after and most people tend to
[58:26] not think about that because they're
[58:29] just getting too excited about the
[58:31] revolution itself and then but if you
[58:34] continue thinking after that Revolution
[58:37] then you'll probably realize
[58:40] that um the the Matrix that you just
[58:43] destroyed is going to be replaced by The
[58:45] Matrix that you'll end up creating
[58:47] yourself um in a way that's like u i I
[58:52] haven't I've seen the first two movies
[58:54] of the the Dune series before I've part
[58:56] of the the entire series is the some way
[59:00] some way it's the perspective that uh
[59:02] nothing is ever really changing uh it's
[59:05] just that whoever is uh on top in that
[59:08] system is what changes
[59:13] um and in in a way that is sort of what
[59:16] what Bitcoin is also sort of doing it's
[59:18] like rep replacing an old Bas layer with
[59:21] a with a new one claiming that it's
[59:23] better um and whether it is is or not is
[59:27] uh only only time will tell um because
[59:30] it will be better in some ways and
[59:32] probably worse in some others and that's
[59:34] for the Next Generation to flck H to fix
[59:37] and flip back into the other direction
[59:40] and by sort of going from left to right
[59:43] weaving trying to stay someone towards a
[59:47] a straight and narrow
[59:50] um we'll be uh weaving for a long time
[59:55] um weaving our lives together and um
[59:59] sharing experiences such as this one so
[60:02] thank
[60:03] you thank you for for for being on and
[60:06] I'm already curious uh what what my next
[60:10] guest will will ask uh will answer for
[60:13] for this question uh it's it seems like
[60:17] there there can be this situation where
[60:21] you really strive for something it's
[60:23] never been done uh and and strive just
[60:26] for that and then you will never be like
[60:28] at the at the end point uh which keeps
[60:32] you motivated but also in a sense like
[60:34] uh unsatisfied with the the outcome kind
[60:38] of it's interesting to say thank you for
[60:40] the
[60:42] conversation thank you L Robin
