[00:00] private property is no longer existent
[00:01] in America what's wrong with America
[00:03] right now you can no longer save in the
[00:04] currency of our nation it has now cost
[00:06] them more money to print a penny then
[00:08] the penny is actually worth itself the
[00:10] majority of the politicians that were
[00:12] telling me that Bitcoin was a bad thing
[00:14] were getting Filthy Rich if you buried a
[00:16] million dollars in your backyard at just
[00:18] a 7% debasement value over the next 100
[00:21] years million dollars that you would
[00:22] probably work your entire life away to
[00:24] accumulate won't be able to buy your son
[00:25] a new iPhone is there any chance that
[00:28] America will as you said wake up and
[00:30] turn the tight and uh do something
[00:32] similar than Salvador what would another
[00:34] four years of treason look like it would
[00:36] be the end of America for the first time
[00:37] in human history man has created
[00:39] something that's Incorruptible beyond
[00:41] the reach of the most powerful
[00:42] tyrannical governments in world history
[00:44] they create the crisis and then he comes
[00:47] the government to save the day if you
[00:49] start adopting Bitcoin and studying
[00:50] Bitcoin you will be able to look back
[00:52] and pinpoint an exact moment in your
[00:54] life when everything changed for the
[00:56] better how long are you actually in the
[00:58] Bitcoin Community like in the on impress
[01:00] also I would say that this is my first
[01:03] year being fully in the Bitcoin and by
[01:05] that I mean Bitcoin not crypto I got in
[01:08] originally the first time I think I ever
[01:10] bought Bitcoin was in 2013 2014 was with
[01:13] a buddy at a party um my buddy was that
[01:16] you know that crazy guy who you know was
[01:18] always into the cool stuff and uh he
[01:20] asked if I wanted to go halfs on him on
[01:23] a couple Bitcoin and I think I threw in
[01:25] 500 bucks and uh he bought us four
[01:27] Bitcoin back then so whatever year it
[01:29] was when Bitcoin was around
[01:30] $250 um and but we had it on Mount gox
[01:33] or he had it on Mount gox it was my best
[01:35] friend from high school that I grew up
[01:36] with I mean we were in diapers together
[01:37] so one of those guys you can just trust
[01:39] to give you know 500 bucks to and let
[01:41] him hold on to your your Bitcoin back
[01:42] then and uh then Mount gox got happen
[01:45] and then then we lost everything and at
[01:47] the time I mean I I didn't really even
[01:49] know what Bitcoin was I just given a
[01:50] buddy of mine you know some money and
[01:52] he'd send me some some text back then
[01:53] when we still had like the flip next Tel
[01:55] phones you know and uh was just sending
[01:57] me like screenshots or not even
[01:59] screenshots but just like messages about
[02:00] how the price of Bitcoin and then uh
[02:02] then we lost it all and then uh in
[02:05] 2015 I was in college and uh it was exam
[02:08] night and I had slept through like the
[02:10] beginning of exams like the you know you
[02:12] go into class and they basically read
[02:13] all the answers and I and I was so tired
[02:15] because I was working two jobs in
[02:16] full-time and uh anyways long story
[02:18] short I slept through the exams or the
[02:20] the the study the the pre-exam where we
[02:22] we studied for it and then uh which made
[02:24] it so we had open book so I it was like
[02:26] you only got three exams so you had to
[02:27] pass like that one to pretty much pass
[02:29] the class so I was open book I was there
[02:31] so long that it gave him him enough time
[02:33] to go home pick up his Bitcoin minor and
[02:34] come back it was like um an electrical
[02:37] engineering motor class or something
[02:38] like that I forget exactly what class it
[02:40] was but he was showing the professor
[02:41] this Bitcoin minor and uh after I
[02:44] finished the exam I was asking him a few
[02:45] questions he's like yeah I just
[02:46] basically plug this thing in and I paid
[02:49] the electricity but it Minds me Bitcoin
[02:50] I'm like oh how much do you how much
[02:51] Bitcoin are you making he's like oh I'm
[02:53] mining about $400 a month and I go wait
[02:55] so you know I'm scratching my head I'm
[02:56] going you're paying you're paying $200 a
[02:59] month in electric and this thing's
[03:00] making you for go how much you pay for
[03:02] the machine I think it was like 500
[03:03] bucks at the time and know maybe 600 and
[03:06] uh I go wow see you're so after three
[03:08] months this thing basically pays itself
[03:10] off and then it is literally just making
[03:12] you $200 a month profit I go could you
[03:13] build two he goes yeah as long as you
[03:15] can get the power to keep running them
[03:17] you know he's a guy had to something
[03:18] about you know contacting his local
[03:20] Energy company and had to come out and
[03:22] make some modifications but he was also
[03:23] growing weed at the time so he had
[03:25] already upgraded his his home to be able
[03:27] to support that workload of power and
[03:29] and uh and he's like yeah but you know
[03:31] bitcoin's you know bitcoin's old
[03:33] technology they got this thing called
[03:35] ethereum and that's uh that's what you
[03:36] really want to be mining it's ethereum
[03:38] you know and I think I don't know if it
[03:40] was you or me who talked about we'll go
[03:41] into that in a minute but I'll tell I'll
[03:42] finish the story so I'll go in a t ton
[03:43] of different directions but uh you know
[03:45] so he's like oh I tell everybody this
[03:47] and uh you know nobody I'm just going to
[03:49] waste my time I'm just you know talking
[03:50] on dead ears he goes but if you're
[03:51] serious about it let me know I'll help
[03:53] you you know get get the stuff you need
[03:54] to build your your first minor and I go
[03:56] well where can I get it can I order it
[03:58] online he goes yeah you can order online
[04:00] and I go all right what's what's the say
[04:01] he goes oh it's New Egg and I go they
[04:03] got an app he goes yeah so I pulled out
[04:04] my phone I downloaded the app I said put
[04:06] everything in the card I'll buy it right
[04:07] now he goes bro if you're serious he
[04:09] goes you buy it right now he goes I'll
[04:10] let you bring it over to my house and he
[04:12] goes I'll build the first one with
[04:14] you I 15 minutes later a few thousand
[04:16] dollars later I had ordered all the
[04:18] parts and uh had this ethereum Miner
[04:20] built in a in a week and that was back
[04:22] when ethereum was still $2.65 so I
[04:25] started mining ethereum at
[04:27] $264 actually to be exact and the thing
[04:30] was minding me three and a half coins of
[04:31] ethereum a day it was like
[04:32] $7.50 that was back when you just had a
[04:35] computer you know this is when
[04:36] motherboards were first coming out with
[04:37] the ability to put two graphics cards on
[04:39] them like nobody was doing the six card
[04:41] graphic card miners yet at the time and
[04:43] then uh so I was like wow this was so I
[04:46] was only spending like $3 a day in
[04:48] electricity and it was making me seven
[04:49] kind of like what he told me right I was
[04:51] oh this is awesome so then I went out
[04:52] and built another one and then by the
[04:54] time you know that was a couple weeks
[04:55] three weeks later so I got the second
[04:56] one on and now I'm mining 4 and a half
[04:58] Bitcoin but I built two or four and a
[05:00] half ethereum but I built two of the
[05:01] same computer right so I was like
[05:04] scratching my head like why the hell and
[05:06] there was no YouTubes there was no
[05:07] sailers there was nobody explaining us
[05:09] the difference between a shitcoin and
[05:10] what Bitcoin was it was like the wild
[05:11] wild west back then and I just couldn't
[05:13] wrap my head around I didn't know what
[05:15] difficulty was I didn't understand that
[05:17] the more people that got online the
[05:18] harder it would become to mine their and
[05:19] I never comprehended that so many people
[05:21] are getting on and Mining at the same
[05:22] time so I was like okay well maybe this
[05:24] you know maybe I'm doing something wrong
[05:25] but screw it I'm still making money so
[05:27] I'm going to go build two more and then
[05:28] I went and built out two more right and
[05:30] then I got to about five coins a day and
[05:33] then by the time I got the fifth one I
[05:34] was back down to about three and a half
[05:36] coins a day and now I have five of these
[05:38] things running in a in a in a condo and
[05:41] I'm the upstairs unit so it was great in
[05:43] the middle of the winter I could have my
[05:44] door wall open and snowflakes would be
[05:46] blowing through the screen and my condo
[05:48] would be like 80 degrees or 85 degrees
[05:51] but in the summer so then now fast
[05:52] forward you know this is probably four
[05:53] or five months later it's getting to
[05:54] Spring it's about April time and you get
[05:56] that first that first warm day in the
[05:58] spring and uh uh I came home my condo
[06:01] was like 102 degrees like you couldn't
[06:03] even it was like insane sauna and that's
[06:06] when I realized I was like oh yeah this
[06:08] is uh you know you have to have a
[06:10] facility to do this in and so then I
[06:12] kind of scaled it back and that was kind
[06:13] of uh how I got into crypto and now no
[06:17] mining running right no no no way my
[06:19] friend I nope now you need some uh now
[06:23] you have to be actually professional
[06:25] with it and you also have a show uh
[06:27] where you talk not only about Bitcoin
[06:29] but you also talk about politics America
[06:31] and stuff like that uh and I really like
[06:34] the the the going out of the Bitcoin
[06:37] bubble I talk always about Bitcoin uh so
[06:40] I'm always interested in the topics that
[06:43] are related to bitcoin kind of touch on
[06:45] bitcoin uh but it's not only just about
[06:47] Bitcoin and today we would have I would
[06:51] like to uh discuss a topic of America
[06:54] and what's wrong with America and also
[06:56] like where do you see America and maybe
[06:59] also like uh the world in in a bigger
[07:01] scale but uh let's first uh focus on
[07:04] America what's wrong with America right
[07:06] now and you also had a show which which
[07:09] was called wake up America um let's
[07:12] let's let's start with that like what's
[07:14] wrong with America right now do you see
[07:16] it in a wrong direction drifting and
[07:19] yeah yeah man so I do uh my my new polit
[07:23] political show is on lfat TV at 2 p p.m.
[07:25] Eastern Standard Time It's called matter
[07:26] of fact that's probably my biggest one
[07:28] where we have the biggest audience and
[07:29] um so in when was the FTX collapsed I
[07:34] think that was in 2022 right so yeah I
[07:37] think prior to to Trump coming into
[07:40] office and some things I I'll I'll be
[07:41] really specific about what I say and I
[07:43] really have to watch myself because I
[07:44] know you're going to put this out on
[07:45] YouTube and there's just certain things
[07:46] that I can't say that I'll so I'm G to
[07:47] really have to to tiptoe around this but
[07:49] basically you know we had we had Trump
[07:54] and um me as an American I kept working
[07:57] harder right um went to school right
[08:00] well let's let's start from the
[08:01] beginning right so I was like you know I
[08:03] I'd explain the ethereum stuff I was
[08:05] working full-time and then you're
[08:06] watching these gurus like uh Gary
[08:08] vanderchuck or Tony Robinson or name
[08:11] your motivational speaker right they're
[08:13] always telling you got to go you got to
[08:14] get a side hustle you got to be able to
[08:15] work harder than everybody else you got
[08:16] to work longer than everybody else and
[08:18] if you just do it consistently for long
[08:19] enough you can be successful so ended up
[08:23] going in starting at an employer where I
[08:25] could be a temp but I knew that they
[08:26] would pay for my college I knew that
[08:28] once I got hired in it was a great job a
[08:30] great place you could support a family
[08:31] on the on your income so I did all the
[08:33] things I went back to school I got my
[08:34] school paid for got a college degree
[08:36] became an engineer put money in my 401k
[08:40] and over the course of a four or five
[08:42] year period I went from making $10 an
[08:43] hour basically to making over 30 and my
[08:48] standard of living didn't change so
[08:51] prior to even Trump right I wasn't big
[08:54] into politics at one point um we'll get
[08:56] there I actually I'll just keep going so
[08:58] we didn't know and I just didn't didn't
[08:59] understand and I think even when Trump
[09:00] got elected I I voted for Trump but I
[09:03] didn't know why I didn't have a reason I
[09:04] didn't have a uh a dog in the fight
[09:07] right I just we just kind of in America
[09:09] we were raised that you don't talk about
[09:11] three things with you don't talk about
[09:12] religion politics or money with your
[09:15] family like that that's the three things
[09:16] that we were raised on and so that's
[09:18] kind of always been a thing
[09:20] so we heard Trump and you you'd be
[09:22] watching if you lived in American you'd
[09:24] see like the fake news the fake news the
[09:26] fake news you hear Trump say these
[09:27] things but as an American like we didn't
[09:29] really fully understand that there was
[09:31] propaganda we didn't understand what the
[09:32] media lied we we kind of trusted our
[09:34] government we thought that our
[09:35] government was actually here to help us
[09:37] and support us and and wanting us to
[09:38] better our lives and we didn't we didn't
[09:41] understand those things and it wasn't
[09:42] until Trump kind of pulled that Veil
[09:43] back and opened our eyes and even then
[09:46] not a lot of us noticed it but I was
[09:47] still so big into crypto then I had my
[09:49] crypto show I was getting close to like
[09:51] 100,000 subscribers I think at the time
[09:53] I'd have been like 80 and uh that's when
[09:56] the FTX collapse happened and at that
[09:59] point I had started to learn a little
[10:00] bit about politics and I was kind of
[10:01] learning how you know political and
[10:03] foreign policy and things that our
[10:05] government does when the fed's going to
[10:06] print money they're going to expand the
[10:08] balance sheet they're going to uh start
[10:10] quantitative easing or quantitative
[10:11] tightening and rate hikes they started
[10:13] to learn how that affected bitcoin price
[10:15] right so you get a little bit more
[10:16] information you can make a little bit
[10:17] better trades you can be better investor
[10:19] you can be more educated and then FTX
[10:21] collapsed and for the first time I'm
[10:23] watching Fox News or I guess the quote
[10:26] Republican side of things telling us
[10:28] that this guy's Bernie made off he's a
[10:29] mini made off and then I have the other
[10:32] news which is telling us that he's just
[10:34] a kid and he just made a mistake oh
[10:35] whoops he stole $32 billion from
[10:37] investors like oh you know could have
[10:39] happened to anybody he didn't mean it
[10:40] he's just a kid and that's when you
[10:42] really start right and then I'm sure a
[10:44] lot of your audience probably heard of
[10:45] bitboy crypto but at the time like
[10:47] bitboy went full off the rails he went
[10:49] he was flying down to the Bahamas and
[10:51] like holding protests and flying
[10:53] subscribers down there and like really
[10:55] tracking down leads and tracking down
[10:56] information and that's when you heard
[10:57] for the first time that you know the
[10:59] Bahamas government was getting their
[11:01] carbon credits from basically the world
[11:04] economic Forum or whoever you want to
[11:06] call this you know really Elite people
[11:07] that are going to dish out these carbon
[11:08] credits and the Bahamas government was
[11:11] going to give their 8 billion worth the
[11:12] carbon credits to Sam bankman freed and
[11:15] they were going to use that to back stop
[11:16] FTX so there would have never been a run
[11:20] on everybody's Bitcoin when we had 8
[11:21] billion worth of carbon credits or an
[11:23] entire Market or billions and trillions
[11:25] of dollars maybe even worth of carbon
[11:26] credits I mean he would have been able
[11:27] to basically manipulate Bitcoin to zero
[11:29] and that's when I really woke up and I
[11:32] go okay something's wrong here so then I
[11:34] started researching on Trump right I
[11:36] wanted to learn more about this
[11:38] President I want to hear some his
[11:39] speeches so I went to and got on YouTube
[11:41] for the first time to search and I said
[11:43] uh best best Trump speech and I clicked
[11:46] on it and of course an ad prompts up a
[11:49] one minute ad before I could even watch
[11:50] the interview of trump or the speech of
[11:52] trump that was an ad of Hillary Clinton
[11:55] just ripping Trump apart and I go Whoa
[11:58] man like like uh this is the
[12:00] ex-president of the United States he's
[12:02] been deplatformed from every social
[12:03] media
[12:05] platform um and that was before our
[12:06] country really rallied back behind him
[12:08] so I was just watching this and I
[12:10] couldn't I couldn't wrap my head around
[12:12] I was like oh my gosh like they've
[12:14] brainwashed just into hating this
[12:17] man and and he actually he loved our
[12:20] country and he loved our he loved
[12:21] America and I think he loved us and
[12:24] that's when I that's when I decided okay
[12:27] like I was watching what party was
[12:29] winning and it was Democrats by a long
[12:31] shot and I know that they hate crypto
[12:33] right I know that they despise it
[12:35] they're super against crypto so at that
[12:37] point I go if if enough of us don't wake
[12:40] up in this country and start getting
[12:43] involved the party that hates crypto is
[12:45] going to completely destroy it and uh so
[12:48] then that's how I got into politics and
[12:50] we can kind of go from there if you have
[12:52] any questions uh I know have kind of a
[12:53] long rant but that's kind of when I
[12:55] realized our country needed men to stand
[12:58] up and just speak truth and just be
[13:00] honest and try to get that information
[13:02] out to the masses and that's amazing
[13:05] what do we expect for the current
[13:06] elections like I think as European you
[13:09] always get a little bit of uh a
[13:12] different view on America I feel like
[13:14] when I talk with uh people online from
[13:18] America and when we talk to like actual
[13:21] Americans about America it's different
[13:23] than mainstream media it's always
[13:26] different so I like to go to the First
[13:28] Source I can possibly find like what's
[13:31] your outlook on on the election that's
[13:34] coming out now I don't think our our
[13:36] country's ever been in a worse position
[13:38] than we're in right now um whether you
[13:41] believe the previous elections were the
[13:43] most secure and legit elections when
[13:45] there's mountains of evidence in front
[13:48] of you that'll show you proof of the
[13:50] contrary uh so the people that did that
[13:54] in 2016 did it in 2020 they did it in
[13:56] 2022 and no none of them have been help
[13:59] accountable and you're seeing the
[14:02] complete destruction of one of of what
[14:04] was once the greatest nation in the
[14:05] world our crime rates are at all-time
[14:08] highs women are no longer safe to walk
[14:10] down the streets in almost every single
[14:12] major city um men are just are literally
[14:15] just jacking women in the face just
[14:16] walking down the street if you are a
[14:18] Woman by yourself you are in danger in
[14:20] every single major city uh we have a
[14:23] migrant crisis we've allowed 40 what
[14:26] we've allowed on the conservative
[14:27] estimates say 20 to 30 million migrants
[14:31] the the truth from people that go down
[14:33] to the Border like me are telling you
[14:34] it's 50 million 80% are military age
[14:37] males so that means we've let 40 million
[14:40] military age males into this country um
[14:43] and even if 1% of those have malicious
[14:46] intent you are talking of hundreds of
[14:49] thousands hundreds of thousands of very
[14:52] violent angry people that come from
[14:55] countries that don't have
[14:57] 911 if that makes sense so when things
[15:00] go bad their first instinct is not to
[15:02] call the cops their first instinct is to
[15:04] get violent and then you have a portion
[15:07] of them who have children who have
[15:09] raised these children in third world
[15:11] countries where the gangs are the rule
[15:13] of the land and it's you steal from me
[15:15] we chop off body parts um or we just you
[15:18] know do really bad things to you and
[15:21] these kids are getting initiated into
[15:22] these things at 8 11 years old right and
[15:26] they're and they're raised that way so
[15:27] when your child is is now being forced
[15:29] to go to school with somebody because
[15:31] your government has forced that person
[15:33] to accept them and and a fight breaks
[15:35] out you know you end up having kids that
[15:37] put pencils through the other kid's eye
[15:39] you know and it gets very violent and
[15:41] very dangerous and it and uh you know I
[15:44] think that's uh that's really really
[15:47] where our country is headed it's not in
[15:48] a good shape and none of the people that
[15:50] are in charge or positions of power seem
[15:51] to want to hold anybody accountable and
[15:55] uh they're they're robbing Us blind
[15:57] Robin they really are they are looting
[15:59] our treasury at a rate that we've never
[16:02] seen before in history um private
[16:04] property is almost non-existent we have
[16:06] migrants now that have squatter rights
[16:09] so if you have a property in America and
[16:12] somebody can break into your property
[16:14] even if it's for a week or a day or two
[16:17] days they can basically break into your
[16:18] house they can create a fake document
[16:21] that says somebody and it doesn't even
[16:23] have to be anything provable they can
[16:24] literally print this thing out of their
[16:25] own computer at home fake a few dates
[16:28] and signatures and say that they've that
[16:29] they've been in this place for 30 days
[16:31] and if they can show any fake proof that
[16:33] they've been in your place for 30 days
[16:36] that you now have to take them to court
[16:38] which can take up to two years for you
[16:40] to forcibly remove these people that
[16:42] have broken into your house so private
[16:43] property is no longer existent in
[16:45] America you can no longer save in the
[16:47] currency of our nation it has now cost
[16:51] them more money to print a penny then
[16:53] the penny is actually worth
[16:55] itself and uh so I'm not too hopeful for
[17:00] 2024 election to be honest I think I
[17:02] think our civilization is on the brink
[17:04] of collapse and then now you add in the
[17:06] wars and everything else that's going on
[17:08] I think we're we're setting ourselves up
[17:10] for some major terrorist attacks that
[17:11] are probably going to get carried out on
[17:12] USA
[17:14] soil uh that's uh I hear that more and
[17:17] more and I'm always wondering like
[17:21] there's this Ralia you probably are
[17:22] familiar with ralo and his um Theory
[17:25] with like rising and falling uh States
[17:29] and Empires um is that the reason why
[17:33] this is like is America just like
[17:35] because it was there and it's going down
[17:37] now it was this just like like nature uh
[17:40] bring that is that feared currencies uh
[17:43] what do you see as like the the root
[17:45] cause of all of that because
[17:48] um I think politics and what people are
[17:51] doing is like uh an an secondary
[17:55] consequence of some root cause something
[17:57] underlying something that's wrong what
[18:00] do you see as that the money my friend I
[18:03] think any bitcoiner really starts to
[18:05] understand it the second that you start
[18:07] investing in Bitcoin and you put in your
[18:09] first $100 and it turns into 110 and
[18:12] then it goes down to 20 cents you know
[18:13] we we ride those Cycles but in the
[18:16] period where you're putting wealth into
[18:17] something and it's going up and you put
[18:19] a little bit more and it goes up and
[18:20] then it really forces you to understand
[18:22] how money works like what is money and I
[18:25] think Robert Breedlove and Saar do the
[18:27] best explanation of I think they call it
[18:29] the Bitcoin the Bitcoin Forex is a
[18:32] really good way to put it or the you
[18:33] know the five key characteristics of
[18:35] money right like what do you want your
[18:36] money to be you want it to be divisable
[18:38] durable I'm sure you've explained it to
[18:39] most your audience already knows I won't
[18:40] repeat them all
[18:42] but our money system is broken and that
[18:45] means that we've given the ability and
[18:47] Jeff Booth probably said it on your your
[18:49] podcast as well when you can convince an
[18:51] entire nation that a 2% inflation rate
[18:54] is a good thing when by design a free
[18:56] market is deflationary you've now
[19:00] basically given yourself or stolen you
[19:02] give yourself the ability to steal 2% of
[19:04] the W nation's wealth every year for all
[19:07] of eternity so no matter how much better
[19:09] you're doing in life when you have that
[19:12] that that Force that's literally
[19:13] stealing a percentage of your wealth
[19:15] every single month on top of you know
[19:18] and I don't know what your guys's tax
[19:20] rate are but I just on my show this
[19:21] morning I just interviewed met the guy
[19:23] from decrypt tax and he focuses on all
[19:25] crypto taxes I said what what are we
[19:27] actually paying like how much in the
[19:29] taxes our Americans paying because I've
[19:30] heard between 43 and
[19:32] 53% and he goes That's spoton so our
[19:35] government is literally taxing you
[19:37] between property tax sales tax income
[19:39] tax your death tax your your mortgage
[19:41] your everything your uh your um uh what
[19:44] do they call it the inheritance tax
[19:45] everything it's like 53% man so how can
[19:49] how can a nation ever Thrive when your
[19:50] government's taking that much from
[19:54] you yeah it's it's it's uh it's it's
[19:57] like I think Austria has the third
[19:59] highest uh tax rate in the European
[20:03] Union something like that like the
[20:04] European Union in general is like quite
[20:07] High uh and Austria is also really high
[20:10] the politicians get paid the Austrian
[20:14] president get paid more than the
[20:15] American president uh stuff like that
[20:18] this it's it's it's ridiculous what's
[20:20] what's going on in Austria with with uh
[20:22] how much the politicians uh get actually
[20:24] paid um but uh that's that's just like
[20:28] um
[20:29] for for me um the main thing that
[20:33] Bitcoin is actually fixing is the
[20:35] property rights when you actually have
[20:37] uh the proper right back and you touched
[20:40] on it before with the houses and stuff
[20:42] like that and when you can actually own
[20:44] it and Bitcoin can actually be that
[20:47] thing that you can actually own and
[20:49] nobody can take it away from you because
[20:51] like we always have this example someone
[20:53] can sit in front of you with a gun and
[20:55] still shoot you uh when you don't get
[20:57] out your when you don't give them your
[21:00] your Bitcoin but in the same time you
[21:02] can take the decision to take it to your
[21:05] crave nobody can force Bitcoin out of
[21:07] you if you have a house it's really easy
[21:11] to take it away from you if you have
[21:12] gold it's really easy to take it away
[21:14] from you I mean gold may be a little bit
[21:15] more difficult because you can hide it
[21:17] somewhere really complicated and people
[21:19] have to know where it is so in that way
[21:22] it's it's it's better than a house
[21:24] because a house it's you cannot hide a
[21:26] house and you can take a house uh but
[21:28] bitco is this one property that gives us
[21:31] back property rights and this will
[21:34] change a lot and um before we get into
[21:36] Bitcoin too much uh I want to first get
[21:40] uh your view on like how did um when you
[21:43] heard about politics and all those stuff
[21:45] that we talked about before how did this
[21:48] influence your thinking of of Bitcoin
[21:50] how did this uh like influence your uh
[21:53] opinion and or like strengthen
[21:56] strengthened your opinion on bitcoin
[21:59] you know it's it oh it drastically
[22:01] strengthened it because the majority of
[22:03] the
[22:03] politicians that were telling me that
[22:05] Bitcoin was a bad thing we're getting
[22:08] Filthy Rich so let me just rattle off a
[22:11] few of these this is our government
[22:13] insider trading is a illegal in America
[22:16] um I don't know if you ever heard of
[22:17] Martha Stewart she was like the grandma
[22:19] who like baked cooked goods and like
[22:20] teached you how to make like homemade
[22:22] mac and cheese and she had like a
[22:23] cooking show and she sold some stocks a
[22:26] while back it was probably 5 or 10 years
[22:27] ago and they sent Graham out of prison
[22:29] for a couple years while while in the
[22:31] last year in 2023 rep Brian Higgins
[22:35] Democrat his stock portfolio plus
[22:40] 238% so let let me put this before I
[22:42] rattle these off into perspective people
[22:44] like Warren Buffett and Ray Delio and
[22:46] the best investors in the world maybe 10
[22:50] 15 Good Year 20 so check this out Mark
[22:53] green Republican 122% Garrett Graves
[22:57] 107% David Rouser 105% steth Molton 80%
[23:02] Ron weiden Democrat 78% John Rutherford
[23:06] Republican 69% and the list goes on I
[23:08] have a list on my screen right here of
[23:10] about 35 members of our government who
[23:13] have out traded just this year the best
[23:17] traders in the world that have
[23:18] algorithmic trading software like there
[23:20] is no way that you do this without
[23:23] inside information and these people
[23:25] regulate markets and regulate an
[23:27] industry
[23:29] so in we have a system set up in America
[23:31] now where The
[23:32] Regulators are protecting you from the
[23:35] people that are stealing your
[23:37] money so the system is so broken and
[23:39] when that system and those people are
[23:41] telling me that I shouldn't be buying
[23:43] Bitcoin that Bitcoin is dangerous or
[23:45] criminals use
[23:47] Bitcoin I I think that they are the best
[23:49] sounding board for Bitcoin and I think
[23:51] Global adoption as a whole watching
[23:53] what's happening to the United States I
[23:55] think is going to play a Major Impact I
[23:56] think it'll be taught to children for
[23:58] General generations and generations to
[23:59] come about what what's being done into
[24:02] America how corrupt our money system is
[24:03] and how you can grow in four years from
[24:07] energy independent and one of the
[24:08] greatest nations in the World Peace by
[24:10] Peace by strength how much more peaceful
[24:13] was the world four years ago I mean we
[24:15] are on the brink of World War III with
[24:17] like four different nations now all of
[24:19] which have nuclear powers and
[24:22] capabilities so yeah that's I think it's
[24:25] to answer your question I think it's
[24:27] it's done a lot to wake me up and I
[24:28] think it's waking up a lot of Americans
[24:30] but you're still in America right yes
[24:33] sir um do you see any countries where
[24:36] you're like this they're doing way
[24:38] better this this should be a role model
[24:40] for uh
[24:42] America El Salvador I think is the
[24:45] shining example of what happens and at
[24:47] the basic you know I was watching a lot
[24:49] of people like Eric V Stacks if you
[24:51] haven't interviewed Eric V stman uh he
[24:53] would be a great guest for your podcast
[24:55] he's he was already on his yeah I love
[24:59] yes your audience knows Eric's a he's a
[25:00] top G man that guy has a wealth of
[25:02] knowledge and you know he he he came
[25:05] back from El Salvador and he said at the
[25:06] end of the day what buelli is doing is
[25:08] he's just restoring property rights to
[25:10] the people he's giving the people the
[25:13] ability to store their wealth and a
[25:14] currency that no government's going to
[25:16] take away from you he's using the
[25:18] government as a show of force to protect
[25:20] your property and to keep you safe which
[25:23] was what your government's supposed to
[25:25] do um seeing the you know there he's
[25:29] going to get attacked by a lot of these
[25:30] other higher powers that doesn't that no
[25:32] these people don't want El Salvador to
[25:33] succeed and seeing that the gang
[25:36] violence that broke out a couple weeks
[25:37] ago and then he sent a thousand soldiers
[25:40] after two people there was some type of
[25:43] gunfire fight or some type of gang
[25:45] retaliation and he sent a thousand
[25:48] soldiers after these people like imagine
[25:50] being a citizen and thinking like uh oh
[25:52] gangs are coming back and then boom all
[25:54] of a sudden like your brother and his
[25:57] cousin in this huge you get in a fight
[25:59] in in school and you're getting picked
[26:00] on by a bully and then all of a sudden
[26:01] like your brother shows up your cousin
[26:03] shows up and you have this big show of
[26:04] force around you it's like okay cool
[26:06] like you've you now are kind of
[26:07] protected and that bully is not going to
[26:08] want to come after you again and I think
[26:10] that that's what he's doing but at the
[26:11] at the end of the day it's just it's
[26:13] basic human property rights and that's
[26:15] what he's providing for a Citizens and I
[26:17] think that you go from a country like
[26:19] America where our politicians are
[26:21] stealing 10% of your wealth every year
[26:23] that's that that's what our currency is
[26:25] getting debased right now is about 10%
[26:26] per year and then let's say worst case
[26:29] scenario um Bitcoin only gains at 14% a
[26:34] year do you understand the difference
[26:36] like if you buried a million dollars in
[26:38] your safe today in your backyard you
[26:40] gave your kids a million dollars you
[26:41] went and dig a hole and you buried it
[26:43] there at just a 7% debasement value over
[26:47] the next 100 years that $1 million will
[26:50] only be able to buy your children $891
[26:53] worth of stuff today so that million
[26:55] dollars that you would probably work
[26:56] your entire life away to accumulate
[26:59] won't be able to buy your son a new
[27:00] iPhone he might be able to get the mini
[27:02] or the knockoff version or an Android
[27:04] something but he ain't getting he ain't
[27:05] getting the iPhone Max so I mean just
[27:09] just do the simple math and then imagine
[27:10] going from a from that to 14% positive
[27:13] per year I mean it's it's astronomical
[27:16] my
[27:17] friend is there any chance that America
[27:20] will um as you said wake up and turn it
[27:24] tight and do something similar than El
[27:26] Salvador of course I know El Salvador is
[27:28] completely different than America they
[27:30] have to do even if they want to take El
[27:33] Salvador as a role model they have to do
[27:34] a lot of different stuff it's also way
[27:36] bigger country there are a lot more
[27:38] implications to that but is there a
[27:40] chance that America will turn a diet in
[27:43] like the next five 10 20 years or is it
[27:47] like such an other network effect facts
[27:50] and the and the yeah the direction is so
[27:53] put in place that it's basically
[27:55] nonreversible
[27:58] I think it's going to be painful I think
[28:00] it's going to take the Right leader
[28:02] that's willing to completely see that's
[28:04] the hard part we have election Cycles
[28:05] every four years so the next the nicest
[28:07] part with our next cycle is that Trump
[28:09] only has four years and if that man
[28:11] makes it back into office even if we
[28:15] don't have the E economic boom and he
[28:16] just you know he has to make policies
[28:19] that make sure that what's happening to
[28:20] America today never happens again and we
[28:22] have to get the right people in office
[28:23] it's massive government but if you just
[28:26] take a look at the election results of
[28:28] 20 and you see that 75 million people
[28:30] voted for Trump out of the you I think
[28:32] we're down to like 320 is our 320
[28:34] million is the population of the United
[28:36] States 360 million then you take a look
[28:38] at gen Z and gen Z makes up 70 million
[28:42] so I would say that there is a 150
[28:44] million people in America that could
[28:46] transition to
[28:47] bitcoin like that right so I do think
[28:51] that you we are watching the Great
[28:52] Awakening I don't know if you can censor
[28:55] the internet enough we have um things
[28:57] coming out like Noster which I think is
[28:59] extremely important to what this world's
[29:02] going to go through in the for the
[29:03] future of humanity in general but I
[29:06] think that if there's anything that the
[29:07] United States has ever been good at it's
[29:09] been removing tyrannical regimes from
[29:12] power and the American people aren't
[29:15] fully pissed off enough yet to make that
[29:18] Leap Forward but keep pushing us keep
[29:21] pushing us keep backing us into a corner
[29:23] and eventually something's going to
[29:24] break whether that is a terrorist attack
[29:27] that happens on USA oil and it is
[29:30] carried out by somebody that broke into
[29:31] this country illegally or even worse was
[29:34] was ushered into this country I mean our
[29:36] government's taxing citizens and they're
[29:39] now paying for migrants to live they're
[29:41] paying for their health care they're
[29:42] paying for their food they're paying for
[29:43] their housing and now they just started
[29:45] passing out $1,000 to $110,000 prepaid
[29:49] debit cards that automatically renew
[29:51] every month so if you're an illegal
[29:53] immigrant you break into our country you
[29:55] are now getting rewarded with a pre
[29:57] prepaid ver Visa Visa that's bought and
[29:59] paid for with our tax dollars and we
[30:01] have homeless veterans who have
[30:03] literally lost siblings in war fighting
[30:07] to defend this country and those
[30:09] veterans are now sleeping on the streets
[30:11] and are
[30:12] homeless because our government's more
[30:14] worried about taking your tax dollars
[30:16] and giving them to somebody who broke
[30:17] the law and illegally entered this
[30:19] country massive uh maybe I'm showing my
[30:23] not native speaker skills here but
[30:26] what's USA's soil I heard it two times
[30:28] now USA soil it means like on our our
[30:31] ground like inside the United States
[30:33] borders right so like whatever we but we
[30:36] bought up to Mexico we B up to Canada so
[30:38] it's just like right here that this is
[30:39] our I guess our god-given our Birthright
[30:41] our nation I guess is the best way to
[30:42] say it yeah really cool um you brought
[30:45] up Nostra which is also really
[30:47] interesting you are extremely active on
[30:49] on social media you are on Rumble you on
[30:51] YouTube you're on Twitter uh I don't
[30:53] know if you're nostr also um what did
[30:56] you thought of files what did Twitter
[30:59] and E musk do to social media and how do
[31:02] you see like the future going forward is
[31:04] like I feel like there's a lot of
[31:06] positive change slowly coming especially
[31:09] if El musk pushing a more freedom of
[31:12] speech it's not 100% on Twitter but it's
[31:15] more way more than before it's not
[31:17] perfect but it gets in the right
[31:19] direction um I don't know but the other
[31:22] platforms they probably are not better
[31:24] than before um but if Twitter actually
[31:27] succeeds this this mainstream platform
[31:29] and like can push also the other
[31:30] platforms to have more policies like
[31:33] that how what do you see as the social
[31:35] media side of things because like the
[31:38] land in America is one thing but social
[31:40] media is where all the the things
[31:42] happening globally so that's a really
[31:43] interesting and really important thing I
[31:47] think it it's probably the most
[31:48] important you know uh freedom of speech
[31:51] right it's it's your first amendment so
[31:53] out of all the things that our founding
[31:54] fathers fought for right and they
[31:56] thought of importance you know your
[31:58] first amendment your ability to speak
[32:00] freely is so important and watching all
[32:04] these social media platforms and what
[32:05] they do with Shadow Banning and limiting
[32:07] content as far as the Twitter files Go
[32:10] that was still at a point where I think
[32:12] most of our country was under the same
[32:13] assumption we just have to expose these
[32:16] people right we just need the Rock Solid
[32:18] evidence the proof that proves what we
[32:21] thought was happening is actually
[32:22] happening and I personally thought that
[32:26] the Twitter files were going to be it I
[32:27] thought like okay boom this is it um
[32:29] this is going to be the time where n
[32:31] Americans wake up and they realize and
[32:32] they're so pissed and so fed up with it
[32:35] they're going to there this is where we
[32:36] draw that
[32:38] line nothing changed budy nothing
[32:40] changed I mean more and more evidence
[32:42] came out more and more corruption was
[32:45] exposed and yet to this day not one
[32:48] person held accountable and I can't even
[32:50] say what I want to say over here because
[32:51] it's going to get your channel in
[32:53] trouble so like that that's that's the
[32:56] saddest part about all this we can't
[32:57] even have an open conversation as two
[32:59] adults and speak freely because we're
[33:01] going to be putting this content out on
[33:03] a platform that will do everything
[33:05] humanly possible to prevent people from
[33:07] hearing the truth I told you a lot about
[33:09] 21 Bitcoin the best place for me to buy
[33:12] Bitcoin directly on a Bitcoin only
[33:15] exchange but now let's talk about how to
[33:17] secure your Bitcoin once you got Bitcoin
[33:20] you don't want to leave them on Exchange
[33:22] you want to take self custody you want
[33:25] to take responsibility of your own own
[33:28] Bitcoin that's why I recommend getting a
[33:31] bitbox bitbox is an amazing wallet where
[33:34] you can not only keep your Bitcoin in a
[33:36] simple way very secure you can even
[33:39] create a passphrase with that passphrase
[33:42] you can basically create a hidden wallet
[33:45] on the device itself make sure to buy
[33:48] your bitbox in the link down in the
[33:51] description and with code Robin you even
[33:53] get a 5% discount and especially with
[33:55] the Twitter files it was scary because
[33:58] um when you saw everything on Twitter
[34:00] and all the platforms all like basically
[34:03] just Twitter um and then you watched
[34:06] what mainstream media is saying about it
[34:08] and then you're like oh they're not
[34:10] saying anything about
[34:12] it I did not I don't know if I did not
[34:14] hear it but I had nothing covered on
[34:18] mainstream media and I was actually
[34:20] searching for it and I don't know if it
[34:22] was a little bit covered in America but
[34:24] here in Europe I did not see anything no
[34:27] man and it's and it's part of that
[34:29] problem is the fact that we've allowed
[34:30] foreign nationalists to buy themselves
[34:32] on the board of directors now I don't
[34:33] know how your stock market or or
[34:35] companies work in the country that
[34:36] you're from but in America the top eight
[34:39] shareholders of any company pick the
[34:41] board of directors right so Warren
[34:44] Buffett people think that this guy's an
[34:45] investing genius you know and if you
[34:47] just stay in the market long enough
[34:48] you'll be rich and it's the great way to
[34:49] go about things but he didn't right he
[34:52] would him Charlie Munger and a few other
[34:54] people would each buy massive shares of
[34:57] a company company that was really truly
[34:59] undervalued and that would give them
[35:01] enough control of the board to push the
[35:04] company in whatever direction that they
[35:05] wanted it to go how they would spend
[35:07] marketing how they would staff and your
[35:08] board of directors picks the they pick
[35:12] the managers of the company right so
[35:14] each board member gets basically to pick
[35:16] a position or a p put a person that they
[35:19] choose in a position of power so you
[35:22] then have governments like the Chinese
[35:25] Communist party and the billionaires
[35:28] that are have made a lot a lot of money
[35:30] inside that
[35:31] party now can buy enough shares of a USA
[35:35] company to pick somebody and put
[35:37] somebody on the board of directors and
[35:39] then those people on the board of
[35:40] directors are the ones that write the
[35:41] policies for companies like YouTube so
[35:44] back previously to the Twitter files
[35:46] like right after the Twitter files
[35:48] leaked was the first time that you could
[35:49] talk about the 2020 election and give
[35:52] somewhat of an honest opinion of what
[35:54] you thought and you weren't going to
[35:55] lose your channel but you know if if
[35:58] somebody can do something like interfere
[36:00] with an important event like that in in
[36:03] a Mal malicious way and then they can
[36:05] deem anybody that talks about that
[36:07] basically a thought criminal and they
[36:09] have the ability to silence that
[36:11] voice and in society in general we've
[36:15] kind
[36:16] of we don't really go out and like go
[36:19] out into the community anymore like very
[36:21] few people I know are interested in like
[36:23] going over to their neighbor's house and
[36:24] sitting on the porch and having a
[36:25] conversation Americans are so broke
[36:28] right now that I would say 20 I I would
[36:32] say in a on a fair
[36:33] estimate 10 to 20% of Americans right
[36:36] now are debating between paying their
[36:37] taxes and feeding their
[36:40] children and things aren't even bad yet
[36:42] gas is only 369 a gallon and inflation's
[36:46] going to come back it's already coming
[36:47] back I've been saying this for a long
[36:48] time I was saying there's no rate Cuts
[36:50] coming I was saying there there was just
[36:51] no way when when you're shutting down
[36:53] the shipping through the Red Sea and 70%
[36:56] of our freight goes to the Red Sea and
[36:57] now they have to go and you know and it
[36:59] increases shipping cost by
[37:03] 700% I mean that's going to be felt you
[37:06] know in it in in the cost of goods which
[37:08] is going to drive everything back up
[37:09] whether it's the expansion of the money
[37:11] supply or just the actual added cost the
[37:13] shipping like the price on everything is
[37:14] going to go up and it is we're seeing it
[37:16] right now and this next if gas gets
[37:18] above $5 a gallon it'll break probably
[37:21] 40% of Americans 50% of Americans will
[37:23] be on the verge of being
[37:25] homeless that's I it's it's for me it's
[37:29] like uh fixing the money would solve uh
[37:32] all those problems in the long run it
[37:36] it's interesting to think of like what
[37:37] could happen in the short run because
[37:39] even if we are now integrating slowly
[37:42] slowly Bitcoin probably a lot of the bad
[37:44] things that already in the wheel
[37:46] probably are happening because the this
[37:49] thing is so bad um but maybe let's talk
[37:52] to us um what can Bitcoin right now do
[37:56] for an an individual level like what do
[37:59] you see is like why should someone
[38:01] that's already uh seeing this now and
[38:05] he's thinking like the same problem like
[38:07] why is Bitcoin now the the perfect
[38:09] solution for that like there are a lot
[38:11] of other options out there like there's
[38:13] gold out there I had someone on that is
[38:15] like 5050 gold and Bitcoin uh and there
[38:18] maybe use cases for gold outside of of
[38:20] of having Bitcoin there are people
[38:22] outside that say real estate because
[38:25] it's such tax efficient especially in a
[38:27] lot of people say that and real estate
[38:29] is like really really big uh in in
[38:31] Austria why do you think like Bitcoin is
[38:34] the the the main
[38:36] thing you know I think your home was was
[38:40] designed to be just that I don't think
[38:41] it was ever supposed to be an investment
[38:43] vehicle like the price of your house
[38:45] isn't supposed to inflate right it's
[38:47] inflating because the currency is broken
[38:49] so if you end up fixing the currency the
[38:51] value of your home would never go up it
[38:53] never should go up right the cost to
[38:55] maintain it the cost to run it the cost
[38:57] of everything should always go down
[38:58] because a free market by Design is
[39:00] deflationary the value of your currency
[39:02] should go up right like the value of
[39:04] your wealth that you store your wealth
[39:07] now short term what can it do it it can
[39:10] educate you right even if you just buy
[39:12] your first $100 worth of bitcoin you're
[39:14] going to want to learn more about it and
[39:16] it's nothing that you can I think that's
[39:17] the hardest part about Bitcoin is it's
[39:18] nothing you're going to understand in a
[39:19] day a week a month I mean you'll
[39:22] probably can can can vouch for this
[39:24] right every day you learn something new
[39:26] you learn a new perspective you learn
[39:27] more about the network more about the
[39:29] protocol more about what people are
[39:30] building onto it more about what's
[39:31] happening with the secular economy
[39:33] that's being built around
[39:34] it we've tried this right silver right
[39:38] I'm not against it I got silver I got
[39:40] gold but not not much and I'm sure as
[39:42] hell not buying anymore but I had to go
[39:45] I was sitting on a big pile of Fiat I
[39:47] was before I bought this place I was I I
[39:50] I was old enough to go through the 08
[39:51] financial crisis and see how cheap
[39:54] everything got right and and I was like
[39:56] dude the next one I'm going to be ready
[39:57] for so since then I've basically been
[39:59] saving and saving and saving and saving
[40:01] right stupid me trying to get in a
[40:04] position because I kept thinking it was
[40:05] going to happen I thought it was going
[40:06] to happen in 2020 I thought it was going
[40:08] to happen in 2022 I thought it was going
[40:10] to happen in 2023 and then I realized
[40:12] that the the F I'm holding on to is
[40:14] getting less and less valuable so I go
[40:16] screw it like least this I can go into
[40:18] any basically any shop in in America any
[40:21] town and and trade this in for cash
[40:23] immediately and just have cash in hand
[40:24] and go buy whatever so I was like okay
[40:26] I'll just I'm getting a little bit too
[40:27] big of a pile of cash I'm going to get C
[40:29] I had to go to four pawn shops right I
[40:32] had to call like 10 before I finally
[40:34] found one that had coinage cuz I wanted
[40:36] coinage right I wanted it to be easy I
[40:38] wanted to be recognizable right I wanted
[40:39] to be able to easily trade it in and out
[40:41] and just the coinage is the way to go so
[40:44] I had to go all over and then after I
[40:47] got it like this is just one of like 10
[40:49] or 20 that I have of these things right
[40:50] so now I got to carry around all this
[40:52] gold and silver right we've tried this
[40:56] since the beginning of time we've tried
[40:58] gold and silver coinage at one point in
[41:00] the United States we in like 19 in 1792
[41:04] was probably the best example of when
[41:06] coinage could actually work and when it
[41:07] did work and when our government only
[41:09] had the ability to Mint coinage which
[41:11] means that you could take raw silver and
[41:12] raw gold and go to the United States
[41:14] government and they would melt it down
[41:15] and they would turn it into like a
[41:16] silver eagle a silver dollar and they
[41:19] would actually it was verified and there
[41:21] was a death penalty in America if you
[41:23] were caught devaluing or debasing that
[41:26] coinage you killed immediately right
[41:29] like on the spot like our government had
[41:30] a zero tolerance for people that
[41:33] manipulated the price of a currency
[41:34] because our founding fathers knew and in
[41:37] George Washington I mean the first
[41:39] president of the United States was
[41:40] adamant about never allowing a paper
[41:43] currency because of the damage that it
[41:45] can be done so what Bitcoin can do short
[41:47] term for you is it can educate you it
[41:49] can really help you you wake up and then
[41:51] it also is its motivation right because
[41:53] when you're going and getting a second
[41:55] job but like that second job is just to
[41:58] kind of maintain your standard of living
[42:00] versus okay if I can keep struggling now
[42:02] I could get that second job and I can
[42:03] put that into Bitcoin it gives you hope
[42:05] for the future it gives you hope for
[42:07] your children and it gives you hope for
[42:08] your family so that's just shortterm um
[42:11] and I think that that's probably one of
[42:12] the greatest assets about Bitcoin is it
[42:14] helps educate people and it gives you
[42:16] hope because without hope all is lost so
[42:18] you have to have something outside of
[42:20] your faith to kind of look forward to
[42:22] and I think that's what Bitcoin is Ah
[42:25] that's amazing exactly what you just
[42:27] said uh actually inspired me I never
[42:29] said it on the podcast before I'm
[42:31] working on it since like half a month I
[42:33] I think like uh I'm writing a book uh it
[42:36] will be called like uh build your own
[42:39] Freedom uh and it will be about Bitcoin
[42:43] also but Bitcoin will be just a side
[42:45] topic on that and it goes in the
[42:47] direction that you just said that the
[42:49] motivation stuff like that I'm really
[42:50] looking forward to to releasing that but
[42:52] it's still a long time but it's just
[42:55] felt like tell read as soon as you do
[42:58] yeah it will be a long time till I think
[43:01] hope hopefully I get it out this year
[43:03] maybe on on my birthday that would be
[43:05] great uh but this is something that I'm
[43:08] really passionate about like having
[43:11] Bitcoin as a base layer in your life
[43:13] having Bitcoin as a foundation for
[43:15] yourself like you can basically put this
[43:18] and all of the sudden you can build on
[43:20] something feel like I'm always comparing
[43:23] I don't know if I did it also on your
[43:24] podcast when I spoke with you uh when
[43:26] you have the sand line and when you have
[43:29] your solid Street like having a feat
[43:33] standard is like running on Sand or mut
[43:35] or something like that and you will fall
[43:37] down you f all over you will be dirty
[43:40] the sand is holding you back yes you can
[43:43] go forward yes you can also run fast in
[43:46] sand and mud but it's so much harder and
[43:49] when you can do the same thing on a
[43:51] solid street with good uh running shoes
[43:53] and stuff like that you're just like
[43:55] going ahead and you're running really
[43:56] fast so um it's it's it's fascinating
[44:00] what just money can do like in the end
[44:03] of the day Bitcoin is money and it's
[44:05] like for money you have to work so like
[44:07] if you don't do anything you also don't
[44:09] get anything uh and this proof of work
[44:12] concept where it gets redistri
[44:14] redistributed because you get something
[44:16] when you uh do something nice it's it's
[44:19] really beautiful and can do a lot of of
[44:21] things for society maybe like let's go
[44:24] to ask this almost most of most of my
[44:27] guest I actually asked this uh what what
[44:30] do you see like when we maybe it's not
[44:32] focus on America let's see it I wonder
[44:35] happens and and there will be a
[44:37] president that actually tries to adopt
[44:39] the Bitcoin standard they are trying to
[44:41] get on a sound money standard they're
[44:43] trying to fix it uh they're trying to go
[44:45] to Salvador outout a little bit 10 years
[44:48] 15 years from now um what will like
[44:51] America on like a sound money Bitcoin
[44:53] standard look like uh like paint paint
[44:55] us a picture
[44:57] you know I think the first thing that it
[44:59] does is it levels the playing field it
[45:02] it gives the people for the first time
[45:04] in all of history something that's
[45:06] Incorruptible which I it's so hard to
[45:08] put a value on for the first time in
[45:10] human history man has created something
[45:12] that's Incorruptible beyond the reach of
[45:15] the most powerful tyrannical governments
[45:17] in world history which is the United
[45:19] States government at this point so uh
[45:22] giving that power back to the people it
[45:25] it it will just create monumental change
[45:27] it looks like a a world where your
[45:30] government is allowed x amount of
[45:32] dollars and and in exchange for those
[45:34] dollars they need to provide services
[45:36] that that the world actually wants or
[45:38] that their citizens actually need I
[45:40] think it cuts down it cuts down the
[45:41] overloaded Boke of government by by just
[45:46] forcing them to to to be responsible on
[45:48] a budget and when every penny that
[45:50] you're government is spending and I
[45:52] understand that they'll have to have
[45:54] certain things they'll be beit Bitcoin
[45:56] privacy and they'll be way for the
[45:57] government to you know have secret
[45:59] military operations where there's
[46:00] certain things that I understand they
[46:02] have to have money for and they have to
[46:03] have it off the books and whatever but
[46:05] that should be such a fine amount of
[46:07] money where like right now we don't we
[46:11] give things like NASA which isn't even a
[46:13] government organization which is just
[46:14] this this entity that's created this
[46:16] private entity that's never been audited
[46:19] and we give them billions and billions
[46:21] of dollars 26 billion doar to put that
[46:23] into perspective a a an entire part of a
[46:26] state in Hawaii got burnt to the
[46:29] ground our government couldn't give
[46:31] those citizens $700 each it's now 6
[46:33] months later and those people are still
[46:36] homeless they're they're still living on
[46:38] the streets and they couldn't even get
[46:39] $700 but we're going to give $26.7
[46:42] billion to NASA this year and they've
[46:44] never been audited we give you know $250
[46:48] billion to Ukraine and that's one of the
[46:50] things that our government has done is
[46:51] just they're they're extracting their
[46:54] your wealth by the ability to print uh
[46:56] money out of thin air so I I forget who
[46:58] says it probably Jeff Booth or saor
[47:00] somebody you know if you know a year ago
[47:03] whenever the Ukraine war started if
[47:05] right before that started Joe Biden said
[47:07] you know what Ukraine needs $250 billion
[47:10] so what we're going to do is your next
[47:12] until you make 5,000 you're going to
[47:14] have to go into work for the next week
[47:15] two weeks or three weeks however long it
[47:16] takes you to take make $5,000 we're
[47:18] going to take all of it you're going to
[47:19] get zero dollar and then we're also
[47:21] going to increase your taxes by 20% so
[47:24] we're going to take another 20% of taxes
[47:26] What would happen there would be a
[47:27] revolution in the streets before
[47:28] tomorrow morning they would have never
[47:30] Ukraine would have never got a penny
[47:32] because we would have never agreed to it
[47:34] um where now they can just print money
[47:36] out of thin air so then you go from uh
[47:38] these endless Wars and these pointless
[47:40] Wars where I think a majority of
[47:43] civilization is waking up whether you're
[47:45] Christian American Indian Muslim Chinese
[47:49] like dude we love each other man the
[47:50] color of your skin doesn't matter your
[47:52] ethnicity doesn't matter your race
[47:54] doesn't matter like none of it matters
[47:56] to us and I think enough of civilization
[47:58] is waking up going wow there's a very
[48:00] small group of elite people that do not
[48:03] have our best interest at heart are no
[48:05] longer doing what's best for our nation
[48:07] it's always what's best for their
[48:09] pocketbooks so I think that's what
[48:10] America looks like I think America has
[48:12] the opportunity to to write a lot of
[48:15] wrongs that we've done throughout
[48:16] history I think they have the ability to
[48:18] show a nation what happens when you cut
[48:20] back on government Bureau bureaucracy
[48:22] and regulations and you allow a free
[48:24] market and I think that that that would
[48:26] be like the best hope for America would
[48:28] be one day we actually have a free
[48:30] market in America where your government
[48:32] serves the people but it's always going
[48:34] to be a small government so that would
[48:36] be my best case for America is we one
[48:38] day um get back to sound money we have a
[48:41] free market in here we got a lot of
[48:43] government a lot of lot of bureaucracy a
[48:45] lot of a lot of corruption and I think
[48:47] that it can all be fixed in a
[48:49] single in a single week or month of the
[48:53] president has to declassify everything
[48:55] so that's what they're terrified the
[48:56] most is that Trump has to just get back
[48:58] into Power day one declassify everything
[49:01] because we have these government
[49:02] agencies that classify everything as top
[49:04] secret and classified and that that
[49:06] classified evidence is the evidence that
[49:07] we need to prosecute these people so
[49:10] it's they're either destroying evidence
[49:11] or they're classifying evidence so that
[49:13] way we don't have access to it because
[49:14] it's technically a classified document
[49:16] well in America we have laws that
[49:18] prevent that we have a constitution that
[49:20] nobody ever follows
[49:22] because we don't have anybody that'll
[49:25] prosecute so those people are handpicked
[49:27] by the president so the president is
[49:28] handpicked people that basically
[49:30] prevents him from ever being you know
[49:33] exposed or or anything the sort so if
[49:35] Trump gets back into office and he just
[49:36] declassifies everything and he has
[49:38] somebody in a position of power that he
[49:40] appoints that will prosecute these
[49:41] people um you're probably going to watch
[49:44] I would probably think about 80 to 90%
[49:45] of the politicians in this country um
[49:47] end up in prison which is why I'm again
[49:50] if we go back to your question about
[49:51] 2024 I just don't see it happening
[49:54] because if it happens even the people
[49:56] that are in right now are most likely
[49:57] going to be investigated for I mean you
[50:01] seen all the people I was reading off I
[50:02] mean it's illegal to Insider trade and
[50:04] we just look the other way because
[50:05] nobody's willing to prosecute it but if
[50:06] we have somebody that's willing to
[50:07] prosecute it we can be the example to
[50:10] the world of what happens when the
[50:11] people take back power from their
[50:13] government and it's returned back to the
[50:15] people and we actually hold the people
[50:16] accountable for the crimes that they've
[50:20] committed that's amazing it's um and
[50:24] what you speak is is uh the P pure truth
[50:28] and I just thought of one thing while
[50:32] you spoke is like the silent death that
[50:35] we experience uh the silence uh theft
[50:38] and death basically both uh because when
[50:42] you have this inflation when you have
[50:44] money Printing and we when you have when
[50:46] you talked about the revolution that
[50:48] would go on if if we would actually have
[50:51] to tax people for the money they sent to
[50:54] Ukraine uh there would be definit Ely
[50:56] people on the
[50:58] street maybe they would have also like
[51:00] on a Bitcoin stand maybe would have also
[51:02] sent money I don't know if they even
[51:04] would have but the money would have been
[51:06] so much smaller uh because maybe you can
[51:09] tax them like half a percent more but
[51:12] when you go to like oh let's tax them 20
[51:15] 30% more then you come to the territory
[51:18] like ah no we don't we don't want that
[51:21] some don't even want half a percent some
[51:24] don't want 10% but if 20 30% like 90% or
[51:28] 95% of the population is basically
[51:32] saying No thank you or maybe even 99% of
[51:35] the population and this is where this
[51:37] silent theft with inflation comes in
[51:40] which is such a cruel thing and uh I
[51:43] just got this like two years after I got
[51:47] Bitcoin uh I was getting all in Bitcoin
[51:50] and then I slowly get got educated by
[51:52] Bitcoin Maxes actually it was really
[51:54] interesting for me how I got like shaped
[51:57] my view by Bitcoin Max is because they
[51:59] were just speaking the truth over and
[52:01] over and over again and I was like oh
[52:03] [ __ ] they actually read about stuff uh
[52:06] and then I became myself one so that's
[52:08] that's really interesting um and we are
[52:11] kind of opening this topic a little bit
[52:13] uh when we come to our end routine the
[52:15] the question today is really really
[52:16] interesting I even thought about getting
[52:19] the end routine at as the first question
[52:21] but uh let's keep it for the end uh uh
[52:24] but before I wanted to ask you something
[52:28] uh besides Bitcoin besides everything
[52:30] you're doing uh is there anything you're
[52:32] currently extremely passionate about
[52:34] like I think every person uh that is uh
[52:39] growing and getting stronger every day
[52:41] is has always something that they are
[52:45] learning currently they they're
[52:47] currently passionate about is there some
[52:49] topic you can share with us that you're
[52:51] currently really passionate about and
[52:52] digging deep into it you know I'm I'm a
[52:56] I'm a filmmaker at Heart Right like the
[52:59] podcasting all was just s second nature
[53:01] uh you know I'm a videographer and a
[53:03] photographer and I love doing those kind
[53:06] of things so like right now I'm working
[53:07] on documentaries like that's something
[53:10] I've always been really really
[53:11] passionate about about just you know
[53:13] sharing that raw truth um I'm getting
[53:15] ready to leave on actually in like two
[53:17] weeks to start filming a documentary
[53:19] called treason and it's going to go
[53:21] through and show you from a raw
[53:25] firstperson experience of what treason
[53:27] actually looks like when your government
[53:29] basically turns its back on you and not
[53:31] just what treason looks like but what
[53:33] would another four years of treason look
[53:35] like it would be the end of America and
[53:37] we're going to be able to show you that
[53:40] and you know the the politicians that
[53:43] have taken so much from us these are low
[53:46] IQ individuals that you
[53:48] know that just don't offer anything of
[53:51] value through the world and giving the
[53:54] ability to show people that you know our
[53:56] founding we we have a we have the
[53:57] constitution in America it's probably
[53:58] one of the greatest pie pieces of
[53:59] literature ever ever wrote and if we
[54:02] followed the Constitution the way that
[54:03] it was wrote and we and we it it was
[54:07] designed to to keep government small it
[54:09] wasn't supposed to be easy for them to
[54:11] pass new laws and take away your
[54:13] Liberties and
[54:15] freedoms but what they've realized is
[54:17] that they can create regulatory bodies
[54:19] like the the FBI the doj the IRS right
[54:24] Congress couldn't pass a law basically
[54:27] tax you or take more of your money so
[54:29] then they created the IRS then they
[54:30] created the Federal Reserve then they
[54:32] created the FDA which regulates food
[54:35] then we created the SEC which regulates
[54:37] markets right and if you notice like
[54:39] those every single one of those bodies
[54:41] came out if you go back and look before
[54:43] they came out before they were created
[54:45] it was like Congress was head-to-head
[54:46] they couldn't pass any laws they
[54:47] couldn't take any more away of your
[54:49] freedom so then they basically figured
[54:51] out a way which is normally by a a
[54:54] designed attack whether that's a
[54:55] terrorist attack whether that's a
[54:57] banking crisis whether that's whatever
[54:59] they create the crisis and then he comes
[55:02] the government to save the day we need
[55:03] this regulatory body to make sure that
[55:05] you're you're staying safe the the the
[55:08] small you know investor right we're
[55:10] going to make sure that you're protected
[55:12] and really they they've never made sure
[55:13] we're protected so I think just giving
[55:16] people like the a raw look at the world
[55:18] and speaking truth and and just
[55:21] developing those friendships and then
[55:23] from there the next one will be on
[55:24] bitcoin so I'm doing this one on treason
[55:26] that'll come out by August or September
[55:28] right before the 2024 election and the
[55:30] next one I'm going to do is going to be
[55:31] on bitcoin and I think if you seen the
[55:33] documentary Leave the World Behind um
[55:36] it's about like what happens when like
[55:38] we get like attacked by like a Cyber
[55:39] attack or a major infrastructure attack
[55:41] where they take over the internet and
[55:43] radios and cars are crashing and all the
[55:45] things that most likely are going to
[55:47] happen this summer um but I want to do
[55:50] one that's called leave leave the Fiat
[55:51] World Behind and it's going to be on
[55:53] bitcoin and it's going to be a
[55:54] documentary of just showing people what
[55:56] bit coin is like now we have El Salvador
[55:58] as a perfect shining example to the
[55:59] world of what you know can happen so I
[56:01] want to go down to El Salvador and I
[56:02] want to go to these other countries that
[56:04] are dealing with tyrannical governments
[56:06] and the people are really standing up
[56:07] and adopting Bitcoin and I just want to
[56:08] make a documentary on bitcoin because
[56:10] that's what I'm the most passionate
[56:11] about I think it it helps educate people
[56:14] and there's no greater gift that you can
[56:15] give yourself or your family or your
[56:16] future grandchildren than taking the
[56:19] time right here right now today to
[56:20] understand Bitcoin and I tell every
[56:22] people and I'll wrap it up on this right
[56:24] I always ask people when was the first
[56:26] time you heard about Bitcoin people say
[56:28] 133 14 15 17 20 it doesn't matter when
[56:32] right Robin if you would have
[56:34] immediately that day spent two hours a
[56:37] day two hours a week two hours a month
[56:39] doesn't matter the time period if you
[56:40] would have dedicated a percentage of
[56:41] your time to studying Bitcoin without a
[56:44] doubt everybody that does would have
[56:45] bought it that means you would have
[56:46] bought it that means your family would
[56:47] have be in an exponentially better
[56:49] position today and if I could have done
[56:52] that for the last 15 years and it didn't
[56:53] matter when you say it or said it what
[56:56] do you think's going to happen for the
[56:57] next 15 years so for the next from from
[56:59] this point right here right now you
[57:02] could if you would start adopting
[57:03] Bitcoin and studying Bitcoin you will be
[57:05] able to look back and pinpoint an exact
[57:08] moment in your life when everything
[57:09] changed for the better and that's so
[57:11] hard to do in retrospect like even
[57:13] people get it's easy to do when things
[57:15] went bad whether you were drinking and
[57:16] driving right you got pulled over and
[57:17] you got a DUI or you crashed your car
[57:19] and you broke your leg and that changed
[57:21] the trajectory of your life it's easy to
[57:23] look back and pinpoint those moments in
[57:24] life when something bad happened it's
[57:26] even harder to look back and pinpoint
[57:28] those when something good happened and
[57:30] it's even harder to do that in real time
[57:32] when it is happening some people talk
[57:34] about the day they met their girlfriend
[57:35] they knew instantly when they saw her
[57:37] right like their life was going to
[57:38] change but you know you can do that
[57:40] right here right now with Bitcoin and I
[57:42] guarantee you it's the only thing I can
[57:43] guarantee you because people are always
[57:46] going to self serve their self-interest
[57:48] and that's what Bitcoin at the end of
[57:49] the day if you if you doubt Bitcoin but
[57:53] you believe that people are always going
[57:54] to serve their their self-interest
[57:56] Bitcoin will always self self serve that
[57:58] self-interest better than anything else
[58:01] and that's it that's uh very I'm looking
[58:04] forward to that documentary I'm loving
[58:06] it uh and I think when we look back in
[58:09] in
[58:10] Bitcoin uh and it gets now more and more
[58:14] easy like when you when you look back at
[58:16] 2012 2013 it was kind of hard to get
[58:19] into Bitcoin because there was not as
[58:21] good of an education but then also the
[58:24] reward was massively uh uh and now the
[58:28] the point is so interesting because the
[58:30] education gets easier and easier how
[58:33] many podcasts books stuff like that is
[58:36] out there that you can get educated
[58:38] basically on Bitcoin in a weekend if you
[58:40] dedicate your time if you find the right
[58:42] sources uh you can get educated really
[58:45] nicely on Bitcoin in a weekend and you
[58:47] know a little bit about it so much about
[58:49] it that you can uh uh trust it and you
[58:52] can go ahead and buy some and then get
[58:54] educated in the following weeks which is
[58:57] amazing and then we are also in an
[59:00] another really interesting point where
[59:02] we're like in this 10% adoption area uh
[59:06] where when the esurf adoption hits this
[59:10] 10% mark it usually really drives the
[59:13] adoption really goes parabolic so like
[59:16] the the first 12 years or something like
[59:19] that it needs to get to like 10% around
[59:21] about that uh and we're getting to the
[59:24] closer to this point of of of % and then
[59:27] the next 80% of adoption are happening
[59:30] in the same time frame so it's an
[59:33] interesting time to get now into Bitcoin
[59:36] and educate yourself in Bitcoin and if
[59:39] you just listen to it and just watch it
[59:41] Go by the next 15 years you will regret
[59:44] it really hard I think uh but that's uh
[59:47] that's just my opinion but I think uh
[59:49] you you should really get at least
[59:51] educated on it uh so you don't uh miss
[59:54] out on the fun in the next 15 years yeah
[59:58] and and you know what too is it if you
[60:01] have kids man in the United States I
[60:04] don't know about but the country but for
[60:07] the last since basically 1913 so our
[60:10] great great grandparents left this
[60:12] country in a worst position for their
[60:14] children our grandparents worst position
[60:16] for their children my parents right
[60:18] worst position for me that that buck
[60:21] stops here right the second you start
[60:23] adopting Bitcoin you're saying that I
[60:26] want to leave this world in a better
[60:28] place for my children than I found it
[60:30] and if that means I have to sacrifice
[60:32] right here right now so that my children
[60:34] never have to go through what I've gone
[60:36] through then I'm going to do it and I
[60:37] think that's the big picture that
[60:39] everybody around the world is going to
[60:40] see yeah it might suck if you own no
[60:42] Bitcoin right now and you're trying to
[60:44] play catchup but you want to know what
[60:45] it's going to suck even more when
[60:46] bitcoin's 250,000 or a million or or 10
[60:50] million or a billion right and and it's
[60:52] going that way so you know you need to
[60:55] really take a look at the people that
[60:57] have been advising you not to buy
[60:58] Bitcoin if you live in the United States
[61:00] and you're watching this Nancy Pelosi
[61:01] Elizabeth Warren Peter schift right
[61:03] these are the people that have gotten
[61:05] Filthy Rich insider trading Nancy Pelosi
[61:08] went from a net worth of like you know
[61:10] $100,000 to now like $150 million and
[61:15] she's never produced anything of value
[61:17] ever no company no business no nothing
[61:20] just
[61:21] $175,000 salary from the US government
[61:23] and has a net worth of hundred 60
[61:26] million and you're working two jobs
[61:28] right we can't keep doing this to our
[61:30] children we can't keep looking the other
[61:31] way and ignoring it and thinking
[61:32] somebody's going to fix it because
[61:35] that's how we got here so at the very
[61:36] end of the day Bitcoin is Hope and I
[61:37] really hope that everybody hears this
[61:39] message and and at least gives it an
[61:41] opportunity and takes the time to study
[61:42] it because it's the greatest gift you
[61:44] can give your family and our children
[61:46] moving
[61:46] forward amazing and uh now uh we can
[61:51] finally get to the end routine uh I'm
[61:53] looking forward to your answer to that
[61:54] one uh
[61:56] and if we now and your the question like
[61:59] we have this endro te where the previous
[62:01] guest is asking a question for the next
[62:02] guest without knowing who the next guest
[62:04] is uh and the question for you is if we
[62:07] approach hyper bit conization where no
[62:10] fear is left uh which entity uh of the
[62:14] feat world will be the last entity to be
[62:18] destroyed like what what feared
[62:20] institution what feared uh Department
[62:23] what feared um entity uh will be the one
[62:26] entity that clings on to the power as
[62:29] long as humanly possible like central
[62:32] banks governments like what what do you
[62:34] think uh the The Entity uh will be I
[62:39] think it be Russia I think Russia
[62:42] provides the highest quality of living
[62:44] for their citizens as far
[62:46] as their their government I think they
[62:48] they're a wealth producer I think they
[62:50] produce things that the rest of the
[62:51] world needs and wants and I think that
[62:53] they are stealing from their citizens
[62:56] the least if that makes sense I think
[62:59] that you understand what I'm saying I I
[63:00] think that you know the money that their
[63:02] government is taxing and taking from
[63:03] them every single person that I've ever
[63:05] interviewed or spoke to from Russia
[63:07] speaks very highly of Putin and they the
[63:10] people that I've seen have a fairly good
[63:13] standard of living over there
[63:14] considering he protects their border he
[63:16] protects their property rights he
[63:18] protects their individual liberties he's
[63:20] you know a a a Christian or Catholic
[63:22] faith-based and I think that that's
[63:25] going to go long way because to get off
[63:26] the Fiat standard you have to you know
[63:28] you have your country has to despise
[63:30] their government and they have to
[63:31] despise their standard of living so I
[63:34] think that countries like that that
[63:35] protect people's property rights are
[63:37] going to be the ones that are going to
[63:38] fail the the the the slowest I guess you
[63:41] should
[63:42] say yeah definitely did you uh side
[63:45] question did you uh watch The daker
[63:47] Carlson interview I sure did
[63:50] absolutely that that was a crazy one and
[63:53] especially the the mainstream media uh
[63:55] reaction that how how angry they were
[63:58] that he got it and he interviewed it
[64:00] like it was really interesting for me to
[64:02] watch even as an European that has like
[64:04] nothing to do with it because it was
[64:06] American interviewing Russia but even
[64:08] here people were like outraged that
[64:12] someone spoke with another human
[64:14] being it's it's mind-blowing considering
[64:17] that like every major journalist in the
[64:20] mainstream media has interviewed bin
[64:22] aladen you know hudan Hussein Gaddafi
[64:25] all of these world leaders during war
[64:27] times right and and that was okay but
[64:29] it's when it goes against their
[64:30] narrative I had we had interviewed um
[64:33] Tara Reed she was
[64:35] um um something by a president our
[64:39] current president right like this woman
[64:40] fled our country because she was afraid
[64:42] that the three-letter agency was going
[64:45] to do her harm right like air quotes on
[64:48] everything but you guys get this person
[64:49] fled to Russia so there's like six
[64:51] months maybe eight months before that
[64:52] Tucker interview I got to interview an
[64:54] American who fled to Russia and the
[64:57] videos that she was showing me of how
[64:59] beautiful it is there she was going into
[65:01] the storees shopping it was safe like
[65:03] everybody was happy and she's like it's
[65:06] just it was like a complete Paradigm she
[65:08] couldn't believe it and she's a I don't
[65:11] know what do they call that when they uh
[65:13] flee the country uh not not an as a
[65:16] refugee uh yeah political Refugee Asylum
[65:18] Seeker I don't I don't know what you
[65:19] call it but she fled for from political
[65:22] persecution so she was allowed to
[65:24] basically go there and stay there and
[65:27] she never has to worry about our
[65:28] government coming after I guess
[65:31] definitely yeah that that interiew was
[65:33] really interesting for me uh but yeah um
[65:37] it was a real pleasure talking with you
[65:40] Ryan uh I think you have one of the um
[65:44] interesting views in in Bitcoin because
[65:46] you bring something new to the table I
[65:48] love your show I love what you're doing
[65:50] also on Twitter and for people now that
[65:54] uh watch you and want to watch more of
