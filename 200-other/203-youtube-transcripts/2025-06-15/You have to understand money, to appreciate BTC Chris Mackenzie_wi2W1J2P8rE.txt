[00:00] you have to understand what money is so
[00:01] that you can appreciate the good that
[00:03] Bitcoin does we are living through two
[00:05] major revolutions the first is like the
[00:07] internet Revolution where everything is
[00:09] digitalizing everything is on a global
[00:11] scale all of the sudden and then on the
[00:13] second side we have the Bitcoin
[00:15] Revolution a sound money Revolution
[00:17] where we all of a sudden have better
[00:19] money how high is the inflation there
[00:21] it's getting very
[00:22] [Music]
[00:25] expensive uh we have today two really
[00:28] interesting topics we have the first
[00:30] topic of Bitcoin racing like Bitcoin and
[00:33] the second topic of racing which is
[00:35] really fascinating H and you are doing
[00:38] you with the team of Bitcoin racing um
[00:41] for the people that don't know about it
[00:43] maybe let's start off with like what is
[00:45] it and then a little bit of the story
[00:47] how did this uh Bitcoin racing thing
[00:50] come about and how did this all start
[00:52] sure yeah so we've always been racing as
[00:55] a family I started racing in cars in
[00:58] 2016 did a year of that and then took a
[01:00] break and we got back into it in 2021
[01:03] through to
[01:04] 2022 um but we found Bitcoin as a family
[01:07] in 20120 uh my brother actually came
[01:10] across it um and we thought why not turn
[01:13] our team into a bit into onto the
[01:15] Bitcoin standard and we thought we just
[01:17] call it Bitcoin racing to spread the
[01:19] message uh and we've gone from there
[01:21] really oh nice so it is a it's a family
[01:24] uh it's a family thing and and uh and
[01:27] and how did you come up to the to the
[01:29] Bitcoin standard how was this um
[01:33] evolving uh you probably you discover
[01:36] did you discover Bitcoin or was it
[01:38] someone of your family it was my brother
[01:40] Charlie yeah he he sort of runs the team
[01:42] pretty much um yeah he found it in he
[01:46] was um looking for ways to help us as a
[01:48] family and thought Bitcoin would be the
[01:50] best way and it's gone very well so far
[01:54] nice and and you are now the the racer
[01:57] of of Bitcoin racing right yeah I'm the
[02:00] driver ah nice we did have three other
[02:03] drivers last year racing in the city car
[02:05] cup which is fun um but they've taken a
[02:07] year off now but hopefully they'll come
[02:09] back next year and um we've got space
[02:11] for more drivers next year if anyone
[02:12] sees us and wants to start racing nice
[02:15] and how did you personally start with
[02:17] with with uh racing how how this all
[02:21] like it's it's it seems like everyone's
[02:24] young boy dream but I I don't know
[02:27] anyone that actually did this in in real
[02:29] life
[02:30] yeah so my my dad started racing when he
[02:32] was about 18 he did um grass track
[02:35] racing and then moved to track racing he
[02:38] did pretty well in that and then um when
[02:40] me and my brother my brother was 10 I
[02:43] think and I was about 8 years old he got
[02:44] us both a go-kart and we fell in love
[02:47] with it straight away and you haven't
[02:49] really stopped since so it's in the
[02:52] blood nice it's that that's really cool
[02:55] that it's in in the in the platum that
[02:57] the uh that you doing doing that um and
[03:00] you have uh something up coming up in
[03:03] this year it's called the mini challenge
[03:05] or like I was J jcv mini challenge yes
[03:09] the JCW mini challenge I'm racing in the
[03:13] sports series which races all over the
[03:15] UK and it's on TV okay and how um as I
[03:21] have no clue about racing and I have no
[03:23] clue about uh this this whole thing how
[03:26] how big is that and and and how does
[03:28] this all divide up because I know from
[03:30] from DV like Formula 1 and I think
[03:34] Formula E with the electric cars I know
[03:37] that's probably Formula 2 and stuff like
[03:38] that how this how does this all line up
[03:42] so it's streamed on itv4 it's it's part
[03:45] of the toker package which um races
[03:47] alongside the touring cars which is the
[03:50] biggest uh Series in the UK and I think
[03:52] about third or fourth in the world um
[03:55] last year for example there was 17
[03:58] million TV viewers over the year
[04:00] and about 400,000 spectators at the
[04:03] events so it's pretty big you can
[04:07] definitely really cool H it's like
[04:10] really cool um and but you raised before
[04:13] so um let's get a little bit into that
[04:16] um what did change till since you have
[04:19] Bitcoin now did you notice anything
[04:22] different or uh is it pretty much the
[04:25] same well we definitely get a a lot more
[04:27] attention people um some people think
[04:29] think oh it's great some people think
[04:30] that's bit strange but then some people
[04:32] ask and we we we explain why we're doing
[04:34] it and um we try and teach them as much
[04:37] as we can in a short amount of time and
[04:39] sometimes people actually get into it
[04:41] because of us which is great and that's
[04:42] the whole purpose we we're actually
[04:43] doing this because we we want to spread
[04:45] the message um to people that otherwise
[04:48] would not have seen it and that's why we
[04:49] chose Mo sport to to do that a nice nice
[04:54] it's it's really cool to have uh uh
[04:57] Bitcoin as
[04:58] a it it's kind of has two different uh
[05:01] aspects always to it like when I see
[05:03] companies doing it or small family
[05:05] businesses doing it or yeah athletes
[05:08] doing it and and all sorts of teams
[05:10] doing it it has like the one as aspect
[05:12] that when you put it on the balance
[05:14] sheet it obviously appreciates and you
[05:17] get it like in a low Time Low Time
[05:19] preference mindset the second aspect is
[05:22] is the whole marketing thing because how
[05:24] many Bitcoin racing teams out there like
[05:26] are you the probably one of the only
[05:28] ones was one in the Indie Car
[05:30] Championship for I think they did it for
[05:33] a year or a few races but yeah they
[05:35] that's where we got the idea from and we
[05:37] just made our own version of it pretty
[05:39] much yeah I saw I've seen that um that
[05:43] was I think this was a few years ago or
[05:45] one year ago or something like that it
[05:47] was in all of my feet also that that was
[05:51] that was also cool um really cool how
[05:54] did you personally uh get get into
[05:56] Bitcoin then here's my brother yeah my
[06:00] brother and um he just got us all on it
[06:03] really we we all came became pretty
[06:06] hooked on it rather quickly and we
[06:09] haven't look back we have a look back
[06:10] sorry nice uh um it's it's for me it's
[06:14] orange bling is always interesting
[06:15] because especially when someone I mean
[06:17] depends on the relationship that you
[06:19] have with with with your brother and
[06:21] with other family members uh but when in
[06:23] the family comes someone hey you you
[06:25] should go look into this and you're like
[06:26] ah okay another such a thing was how was
[06:30] that for you is did you did you dismiss
[06:32] it it first or like how did you warm up
[06:34] to the idea of
[06:35] Bitcoin um well I known about it since
[06:38] 2016 but just had no idea how to get
[06:40] involved and how to buy any so I I
[06:42] didn't really make any effort to to get
[06:45] it but when he mentioned it I thought oh
[06:47] I remember that and um he didn't didn't
[06:50] take much persuading for any of our
[06:51] family really even our grandparents
[06:53] which was a bit of a shot they um they
[06:56] got on board rather quickly as well but
[06:58] um yeah it didn't take a lot of work for
[07:00] him to persuade us
[07:02] because we we understand what bitcoin's
[07:06] about and yeah we uh we believe in it
[07:10] yeah it's it's fascinating for me how
[07:12] how people then uh get into Bitcoin and
[07:16] how Bitcoin is kind of this this tool
[07:18] for uh everyone and it has but it has no
[07:22] CEO it has no marketing team it has
[07:24] nothing of the above and still people
[07:28] are doing so much for Bitcoin like you
[07:32] racing with such a big logo and there's
[07:35] no Bitcoin CEO that pays for for you
[07:37] basically there's like decentralized
[07:40] funding there's all those decentralized
[07:42] things um and it's it's from an
[07:45] advertisement and marketing perspective
[07:47] it's fascinating how how this grows I
[07:50] mean I'm 100 like I'm a in if if a if
[07:55] there would be a Bitcoin CEO and in a
[07:57] Bitcoin marketing team I would would
[07:59] probably be part of it because I'm
[08:01] full-time in Bitcoin and doing the
[08:03] Bitcoin podcast and stuff like that so
[08:05] I'm kind of in this
[08:08] decentralized marketing team but there's
[08:11] no one that says like oh this month we
[08:14] should get out this message or like we
[08:16] should concentrate more on the store
[08:18] value side or let's let's focus on that
[08:22] um and this is a completely different
[08:24] from all the things that we are usually
[08:27] used to in the world like they usually
[08:29] they're like hierarchies there's someone
[08:31] having a plan there's someone giving
[08:33] some guidelines out and this is by the
[08:35] way also a good thing usually because if
[08:38] there's a team and no one has the lead
[08:40] on there's there's no direction in that
[08:42] team usually um but it's fascinating
[08:45] that it works with Bitcoin how did you
[08:48] like uh how did how do you see Bitcoin
[08:51] and this decentralized thing for me also
[08:53] is fascinating that satosi
[08:55] Nakamoto could just leave the project
[08:58] after not even really a year like it
[09:01] pushed it out and was like ah I I move
[09:04] on to other things it is big enough now
[09:06] and then still it was this tiny thing uh
[09:10] tell us like how do you look at Bitcoin
[09:12] well I think bitcoin's the future I
[09:14] think it's accessible for everyone who
[09:16] has a phone pretty much there's no
[09:18] intermediary you don't need a bank to
[09:20] send any any money or receive anything
[09:22] it's very
[09:24] fast whereas sending money for a bank
[09:26] can take up to few days or even a week
[09:28] um
[09:29] I just think it's it's what money should
[09:32] be it's fair and no one can turn it off
[09:36] no one can you
[09:39] know I just
[09:41] think yeah I just think it's uh sort of
[09:47] indestructible yeah it is definitely it
[09:50] definitely is indestructable um but you
[09:52] are on a race trackon in a challenge
[09:55] where you are the only Bitcoin team so
[09:58] there are a lot of other players
[10:00] involved do do they notice Bitcoin in in
[10:03] any special way or do they just look at
[10:05] that ah you you have a different
[10:08] sponsor yeah well I was actually quite
[10:10] shocked because the the other
[10:12] teams they don't really say anything or
[10:15] ask any questions really they just get
[10:16] on with it they think oh that's
[10:18] different but it is what it is and they
[10:20] don't really come and ask but some of
[10:22] the fans do some of the fans are
[10:23] interested and ask like some people
[10:26] think oh are you sponsored by Bitcoin
[10:27] and we say no we just we're just doing
[10:30] it the good of Bitcoin from our own
[10:33] Pockets yeah that's a weird conversation
[10:35] right uh because usually when you when
[10:37] you put something on your shirt you're
[10:39] like oh yeah they sponsor you and
[10:40] they're like who's who's paying like no
[10:43] Bitcoin is not really paying
[10:46] us but but you attract uh Bitcoin
[10:49] companies and and and with that it's
[10:51] like
[10:53] indirectly paid for from Bitcoin even
[10:56] though Bitcoin has no payroll or
[10:57] something like that yeah it's a it's a
[11:00] weird uh thing weird concept also of
[11:04] that um one one thing is also
[11:06] interesting bitcoiners are usually
[11:08] really on the Low Time preference side
[11:11] like they always um want to take the
[11:14] right steps uh don't stress like take
[11:17] the right steps um did this mindset in
[11:21] your team shift with Bitcoin or was it
[11:23] all always like a little bit in in that
[11:26] direction where the the mindset of of of
[11:29] Bitcoin was in this low time preference
[11:32] let's do the right steps in the right
[11:34] way and uh let's let's not do it for the
[11:36] next quarter let's do it for the next
[11:39] decade yeah definitely we're we're in
[11:41] we're in for the long run we've been
[11:43] through two bare markets now so we know
[11:45] what it feels like yeah we've had some
[11:48] lows but we know that the overall
[11:51] Bitcoin goal is just to hold on to it
[11:55] for as long as you can um we haven't
[11:58] sold anything we've just
[11:59] kept onto it and I think that's the best
[12:01] way to do it just huddle really really
[12:03] nice do do you have uh for for T fours
[12:07] for the for the racing uh um that is
[12:11] that challenge is can I see it like like
[12:14] as a tourament or it it's like ending in
[12:18] 2024 so probably there's like a winner
[12:20] at at some point yeah so it's a
[12:23] championship um there two or three races
[12:26] each event uh usually one a month or two
[12:29] month and it runs from April through to
[12:32] uh October um so there's qualifying
[12:36] first the person with the fastest lap
[12:38] qualifies first obviously and then so on
[12:40] and so forth and then there's a point
[12:42] system so first place gets the most
[12:44] points second Bas so on and then at the
[12:46] end of the year they'll be a champion
[12:48] yeah nice I love it it's really cool to
[12:51] have um Bitcoin and racing in in in kind
[12:54] of one thing and have this this this all
[12:58] all all all Shake out in in yeah in in
[13:02] in one nice nice package in the end
[13:06] what's your end goal is is it like um
[13:08] growing the team and maybe coming to um
[13:12] better like higher challenges or like in
[13:14] other races like what's uh where can you
[13:18] go with that Bitcoin racing
[13:19] team yes so we started off in the city
[13:22] car cup I was driving a citan C1 and we
[13:26] always said C1 to F1 but I think F1 is
[13:30] probably a bit Out Of Reach but now
[13:32] we're in the token package in the mini
[13:34] challenge we want to do that for a year
[13:36] or two and then move up to the British
[13:39] touring cars which is the biggest Series
[13:41] in the UK uh and then go from there
[13:43] really we might move into the Porsche
[13:45] super cup which follows the F1 races
[13:48] around as a support race that would be
[13:50] pretty huge um but yeah we're definitely
[13:52] interested in growing a team and having
[13:54] more drivers and sort of maybe turning
[13:56] it into a business
[13:59] and now is it is it already a business
[14:01] or or are you all doing something on the
[14:04] side or uh I wouldn't really call it a
[14:07] business at the moment um we're just
[14:10] doing it because we love racing and we
[14:12] love Bitcoin and anything anything more
[14:16] that we we get from it is is a plus and
[14:20] yeah we'll we'll go as high as we can
[14:21] with it to reach more viewers is the
[14:25] goal so so you do something next to it
[14:29] or is it still is it already a full-time
[14:31] thing I I work I work at archex they're
[14:35] one of my sponsors so no it's not a
[14:37] fulltime we're not really making any
[14:39] money from it we're just doing it for
[14:41] the love of it h what's ARX what are
[14:44] they doing FCA regulated digital
[14:47] Securities Exchange in London they're
[14:50] also a custodian and a brokerage as well
[14:53] I work there on the operations team so
[14:55] it's pretty cool that they uh they
[14:56] sponsored me nice I mean if if if if
[14:59] they employ you they they can also
[15:01] sponsor you right they should do that
[15:04] yeah true yeah they didn't take too much
[15:07] persuading either so it's pretty good so
[15:08] hopefully have that throughout
[15:10] throughout my racing career
[15:14] as I love it I can imagine actually like
[15:18] uh when you are in that challenge I can
[15:20] imagine there's like an car that you
[15:24] have to pay for or maybe even several
[15:27] cars we we bought the car so we we own
[15:30] the car um when we want to get rid of it
[15:34] we should be able to get the same sort
[15:35] of money back for it which is good um
[15:37] but yeah you buy the car you can rent
[15:40] from other teams but it's just more
[15:44] expensive and there then there's like
[15:47] probably a fee to get in into the
[15:51] challenge yes to enter the championship
[15:53] is quite a lot um it's about
[15:56] 15,000 for the year to the races and
[16:00] then you've got things like tires and
[16:02] maintenance changing parts it all adds
[16:05] up quite quick it's a not cheap sport
[16:08] unfortunately yeah it's it's a high
[16:10] entry barrier I I I guess it's like
[16:13] starting swimming is easier yeah
[16:17] definitely in practice whenever you want
[16:19] because um there's rules and regulations
[16:21] on that and it's uh expensive even to
[16:25] practice so you you can't just go and
[16:28] play football for example example you
[16:29] have to go out and get the car drag the
[16:32] car get the fuel yeah so it's not cheap
[16:35] oh yes because when you are training for
[16:39] it you also have to you cannot train on
[16:42] the normal
[16:45] streets could be very expensive but you
[16:47] you have to like on a track and you also
[16:50] have to pay probably some fees to get
[16:52] going yeah
[16:54] exactly oh man that's I I love that
[16:58] Sports and I from time to time I drive
[17:02] in Gokarts in small it's probably not
[17:05] not even a little bit
[17:08] relatable because racing drivers start
[17:10] off in go-karting that's where you learn
[17:12] the basics and then you go from carting
[17:14] to
[17:15] cars how different is it but it's
[17:19] like you have a lot of transferable
[17:21] skills but it is it's very different
[17:23] there's a there's more at stake there's
[17:25] more risk and yeah but you do learn a
[17:29] lot from carting and the best drivers in
[17:31] the world most of them started
[17:33] go-karting when they were probably six
[17:35] or seven years old maybe even younger
[17:37] for me a fascinating is when when people
[17:40] talk about Formula 1 and and and racing
[17:43] as a sports they all like ah it's not a
[17:46] sports because you just sit in a car but
[17:48] everyone that was for like just 20
[17:51] minutes in a go-kart and raced uh knows
[17:54] that it's like you are getting out and
[17:56] you're sweating a lot like it's it's
[17:59] really heavy and and your arms and
[18:00] everything and in with the small go-
[18:03] Cuts probably it's easier with like
[18:06] bigger cars and longer durations and
[18:08] stuff like that um yeah H how do you
[18:11] train for that uh I don't really train
[18:13] for it directly I I do go to the gym a
[18:16] lot so that definitely
[18:17] helps
[18:20] um I don't think you really need to
[18:22] train as such for the championship I'm
[18:24] in but saying that after a session my
[18:27] neck really does ache from the g-forces
[18:29] I know it's not as much as F1 but your
[18:32] neck's moving around a lot you have to
[18:33] keep your neck upright really and um
[18:36] yeah so it does hurt so maybe I should
[18:38] start training my neck in the gym I just
[18:40] think that would look a bit
[18:42] weird but the stronger you are the more
[18:45] man the more manageable it is um but
[18:49] yeah I think it's a different sort of
[18:50] training that you you do for racing um I
[18:53] just do weights really yeah it's it's uh
[18:57] I also see that they I mean Formula One
[19:00] is is probably a different thing but uh
[19:04] they also have like late weight limits
[19:06] and stuff like that so they they have to
[19:08] be also on the the weighing machine and
[19:11] and see that they having
[19:13] not not not uh not not enough some not
[19:17] uh yeah they should have enough like
[19:19] there has a limit they have to go right
[19:22] yeah um yeah we got weight limits in our
[19:24] in our Championship um there's a minimum
[19:26] weight for the car so when the car comes
[19:28] in from from qualifying or race if it's
[19:30] over that you if it's under that sorry
[19:33] you'll uh you'll be disqualified oh and
[19:36] it's also with also with you yeah yeah
[19:39] they're very strict on
[19:41] it so if
[19:44] you
[19:45] enough so even if I was one kilo under
[19:48] the minimum I'd be disqualified ah on
[19:52] the race if you are listening to this
[19:54] podcast you might be wondering what is
[19:56] actually the setup look like of Robin or
[19:59] how can I improve my Bitcoin setup and
[20:01] there's two things you have to buy
[20:03] Bitcoin from the right source and you
[20:04] have to store Bitcoin the right way
[20:07] let's focus on the first thing how to
[20:09] buy Bitcoin it's simple have a Bitcoin
[20:11] only exchange don't deal with the
[20:13] shitcoin exchanges don't deal with an
[20:15] exchange that has an own token or
[20:17] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[20:19] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[20:22] for me the best partner for that and now
[20:26] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[20:28] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[20:30] a self custody solution where you
[20:33] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[20:36] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[20:39] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[20:42] your Bitcoin on there back up your seed
[20:44] phrase and you are better than 95% of
[20:48] all Bitcoin hodlers if you have more
[20:50] than ,000 in Bitcoin it's an absolutely
[20:53] must have one last thing before we get
[20:56] back to the video I'm really passionate
[20:58] about me other bitcoiners and there's an
[21:00] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[21:03] in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's
[21:06] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[21:09] conference in whole of Europe for all
[21:11] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[21:14] this place in June for all europees it's
[21:16] a must go anyways you're so close to the
[21:19] Bitcoin PR conference you basically have
[21:21] to come I will do interviews there and I
[21:24] would love to meet you all there use
[21:27] code Robin for all all my sponsors to
[21:29] get discounts and use the links down in
[21:32] the description and and and you probably
[21:34] weigh yourself
[21:37] then it's the weight of the driver and
[21:40] the car together so you drive it onto a
[21:42] way
[21:43] Bridge you're underwe we have a box
[21:46] where you can put heavy metal in to to
[21:48] get you to
[21:50] wait or more
[21:52] fuel oh so uh it's it's okay for for you
[21:57] to be um not heavy but then you have to
[22:00] compensate uh with it it's it's about
[22:03] the to makes sense because why why why
[22:07] should you be punished just because you
[22:09] not have enough uh weight yeah but I do
[22:12] see the the F1 drivers they weigh the
[22:14] car with them in it and then they step
[22:16] out and step on a on a scale to weigh
[22:20] themselves with their helmet on so I
[22:21] don't know how it works there but maybe
[22:23] there's two separate ways I don't know
[22:27] yeah that's what thinking I was like I
[22:29] always see those Formula 1 uh um Racers
[22:35] outside stepping with with uh the that
[22:39] weighing thing and and then like makes
[22:42] so much more sense to just like do uh do
[22:44] the thing uh on the on the racing
[22:48] track yeah but uh we kind of drifted off
[22:51] the the the
[22:52] Bitcoin
[22:54] topic um I I usually ask my guests um
[22:58] what they think about Bitcoin and
[23:00] especially with the Fiat currencies it
[23:02] would be interesting to know what what
[23:03] you think of of Fiat currencies US
[23:06] Dollars Euro where where are you from
[23:09] what what Fiat currencies do you have to
[23:11] live with uh
[23:13] GBP yeah pounds oh okay so
[23:18] yeah how high is the inflation there not
[23:21] not as not as crazy in Venezuela but
[23:24] also pretty high it's pretty bad at the
[23:26] moment yeah it's uh it's getting very
[23:28] expensive even for basic things now um
[23:33] I'd quite like to to move away to be
[23:35] honest but um yeah I don't I don't like
[23:38] fat currencies they're printed out thin
[23:42] air um that's what makes Bitcoin so good
[23:44] is because there'll only ever be 21
[23:46] million of them so it's uh it's very
[23:48] scarce and yeah if if you're watching
[23:52] this and you don't have Bitcoin you
[23:53] probably should think about
[23:56] it yeah 100% this is um which is also uh
[24:02] for me fascinating to see that we
[24:04] bitcoiners are like that always that
[24:06] passionate about and and we we kind of
[24:09] cannot stop orange people I tried it I'm
[24:12] way more defensive now because of the
[24:14] podcast and I see that everyone of my
[24:17] friends and families get to know about
[24:18] Bitcoin because of my social media
[24:20] things so I'm a little bit more chilled
[24:23] now uh but even it's even if if if yeah
[24:27] uh I I I still try to to bring it up in
[24:30] in in in conversations but do you
[24:33] imagine that uh feat currencies will
[24:35] always be here I'm fascinating that
[24:37] they're still living and there is a
[24:40] really long history of inflation uh uh
[24:43] but do you think that we could come to a
[24:47] Bitcoin standard I really do hope so uh
[24:50] but I think it's gonna take a fairly
[24:53] long time um and a lot of work because
[24:57] uh the government
[24:59] um what's the word they've been around
[25:03] for so long and fear currency has become
[25:05] so normal that most people don't even
[25:08] question it and don't even question the
[25:10] fact that money is just printed out of
[25:13] thin air um but yeah I really hope that
[25:16] the Bitcoin standard does become a thing
[25:19] because it's just more fair and yeah
[25:22] it's easily accessible for
[25:24] people uh yeah some people can't even
[25:26] get a bank account so yeah I don't like
[25:30] feat why do you think why do you think
[25:33] people don't um question it I'm baffled
[25:36] by that and so many people like even
[25:39] Michael CA talks about that that he did
[25:41] not question what is money till uh he
[25:45] got to know about Bitcoin and he was a
[25:48] yeah CEO of a publicly traded company
[25:50] like he was really into the finan scene
[25:53] like he he he saw a lot in the world uh
[25:57] but still he did not question like what
[25:59] is actually money like why do you think
[26:01] people seemingly don't care yeah well I
[26:04] think that's the thing people don't
[26:06] actually really understand what money is
[26:09] and a lot of the time they won't take
[26:11] the time to to try and
[26:13] learn so people that don't learn about
[26:15] money probably won't really care to
[26:17] learn about Bitcoin um I think you have
[26:20] to understand what money is so that you
[26:23] can appreciate the good that Bitcoin
[26:25] does um but I think it's just probably a
[26:29] lack of of Education it's something that
[26:31] you're not taught in school which is
[26:33] just totally strange you don't learn
[26:36] things that actually help you in life
[26:38] like paying taxes and and learning about
[26:41] money um so I think that's probably a
[26:43] big factor to it um but more so just the
[26:47] fact that people don't take the time to
[26:50] to study and and get an understanding
[26:52] about it
[26:54] yeah I didn't really know what money was
[26:59] for a long time um but when I discovered
[27:01] Bitcoin it it made me want to to get an
[27:04] understanding
[27:05] of how it actually
[27:10] works it's it's the for me uh when when
[27:15] we look at Bitcoin uh and and we look at
[27:19] the world where Bitcoin is not there and
[27:22] I'm like what should I do for a pension
[27:26] what should I do for for savings
[27:28] what should I do for longterm and
[27:30] medium-term
[27:31] savings and for me the only answer is
[27:34] right now Bitcoin I don't know do you do
[27:36] you also use Bitcoin as your pension do
[27:38] you have different Pension Plan also I'm
[27:41] pretty much all in with
[27:43] Bitcoin I think it's the best investment
[27:45] ever um certainly one of the most scarce
[27:48] if not the most scarce um I don't really
[27:52] I'm not really interested in any any
[27:53] other assets to be honest same as my
[27:55] brother yeah it's fascinating for me
[27:58] that we we we found that one store of
[28:02] value and it's it it's also interesting
[28:06] that we are living through two major
[28:10] revolutions the first is like the the
[28:12] internet Revolution where everything is
[28:14] digitalizing everything is uh on a
[28:17] global scale all of the sudden and then
[28:19] on the second side we have the Bitcoin
[28:21] Revolution the sound money Revolution
[28:23] where we all of a sudden have better
[28:25] money uh uh which uh I find uh amazing
[28:31] to to have yeah that's uh that's that's
[28:34] that's really cool uh it's I like it a
[28:36] lot is is there anything that uh you are
[28:39] passionate about uh besides uh yeah
[28:41] Bitcoin and and racing
[28:44] um Bitcoin racing going to the gym I
[28:48] like traveling I went to Southeast Asia
[28:50] last year which was cool um but other
[28:53] than that no not not really just uh
[28:56] racing in Bitcoin pretty much
[28:59] I like
[29:02] it for for me for me it's kind of gets
[29:06] more more and more into this this
[29:09] Bitcoin thing and E even
[29:13] uh even uh the small things I do outside
[29:16] of Bitcoin are kind of related to
[29:17] bitcoin for example I F like yesterday
[29:20] the whole day I was setting up the new
[29:22] studio uh and and this all has nothing
[29:26] to do with Bitcoin but doing it for
[29:28] Bitcoin so like even stuff that is not
[29:31] related directly to bitcoin is kind of
[29:33] into Bitcoin but I I learned about
[29:36] lightings and and background things and
[29:39] and yeah it's it's it's it's it's a lot
[29:42] of work get to get it acceptable
[29:46] unfortunately I don't have like in my
[29:48] last Studio I had like a nice background
[29:51] but right now I don't I only have a wide
[29:54] uh white wall uh and uh this is is my my
[29:58] only option and this yeah I like it a
[30:02] lot yeah thank you thank you I'm trying
[30:05] my
[30:06] best get something right yeah perfect
[30:09] then uh is is there anything uh else as
[30:13] topic otherwise we will we will go to
[30:15] the to the end routine uh have you been
[30:17] to our
[30:18] salador oh uh no but I have to like are
[30:22] you in in Salvador or I have been I went
[30:26] in 2022 with my family it was yeah
[30:29] really good nice weather nice food nice
[30:33] people and bitcoin's Leal tender so
[30:35] perfect it's a very nice uh very nice
[30:38] country I think um president Mell is
[30:41] doing a great
[30:42] job yeah I've seen uh on on your car is
[30:46] the salador flag Right Above It how did
[30:50] this came to to uh to be yeah that was
[30:54] actually my mom's idea she she thought
[30:57] we should put the flag on the car and
[30:59] then um we got in contact with the UK
[31:02] ambassador to El Salvador and we went to
[31:04] their office and had a chat with them to
[31:07] ask for permission so she she she
[31:09] founded the presidential office in El
[31:13] Salvador and eventually we got
[31:14] permission to do it which is really cool
[31:17] so we're sort of Partners in a sense I
[31:19] guess um trying to spread message of
[31:22] Bitcoin and El Salvador simultaneously
[31:25] uh you cannot just put a flag on a car
[31:28] you have to ask for permission yeah well
[31:31] we we thought that but we thought um
[31:33] best to ask but they they were very
[31:35] happy about it they were really pleased
[31:38] that we wanted to
[31:40] to promote their country in a
[31:43] sense yeah I mean on the top ah nice
[31:48] nice nice have you been you have been to
[31:50] to salvad how was your um Jour
[31:54] there uh it was quite a long one it's
[31:56] eight hours to Canada and then I think
[31:59] about four or five hours to hour from
[32:02] Canada but I really enjoyed it the the
[32:04] weather was very nice friendly people
[32:08] and yeah it's just a whole different
[32:09] country to what it used to be so it is
[32:12] like I had
[32:13] already uh I don't know 12 people or
[32:16] something like that uh from uh El
[32:20] Salvador or people that went to El
[32:23] Salvador uh so like they living now
[32:25] there um on my show and I talked with
[32:28] them so much about El Salvador and what
[32:31] the mission is and it's kind of like
[32:32] everyone agrees it's like a startup
[32:35] country uh the bodyguards and the
[32:37] security guards uh in front of the uh
[32:42] shops and stores are getting less uh you
[32:45] can get out of of the house
[32:48] without being in danger immediately uh
[32:51] and then also the monetary aspect you
[32:53] can pay with Bitcoin not how was your
[32:57] experience with did did you pay stuff
[32:58] with Bitcoin I heard it's it's still not
[33:01] really widespread but it's like quite
[33:03] good yeah it's quite good um a lot of
[33:06] restaurants accept it um a few places
[33:10] still don't but I
[33:12] think uh with more time they'll start to
[33:15] um but on the whole it's pretty pretty
[33:17] well adopted I think from what I saw I
[33:21] love it yeah Bitcoin country how does
[33:24] this how do you think this this whole
[33:26] thing blazs out with with all the
[33:27] countries because Game Theory like when
[33:30] when you're familiar with game theory of
[33:31] of country uh level it's like when one
[33:35] country starts to really aggressively
[33:36] adopt it it's just a matter of time
[33:38] until someone else is also like ah let's
[33:41] let's let's try it let's let's see how
[33:43] this works then there's another country
[33:44] another country and the first countries
[33:47] obviously are the more smaller ones uh
[33:50] but eventually a big one could could
[33:53] fall and say like ah let's let's let's
[33:56] make Bitcoin something how do you see
[33:57] the the the uh game Fury uh uh playing
[34:02] out well I I hope more countries adopt
[34:04] it I think there's no deny that it's
[34:06] worked well for Al Salvador um I think
[34:10] Argentina did Argentina I think adopt it
[34:13] I don't know Argentina is is is
[34:16] interesting because uh jav M the
[34:19] president gets kind of celebrated for
[34:22] being a Bitcoin president but he's not
[34:25] really a
[34:26] bitcoiner uh but he is a really big um
[34:29] proponent of austan economics and
[34:32] letting the free market decide so he
[34:35] just wants to destroy the Central Bank
[34:38] of Argentina and let all currencies US
[34:43] dollar out of uh cryptocurrencies
[34:46] Bitcoin
[34:47] freely uh spread throughout the country
[34:50] and let the market decide who the winner
[34:53] is this is what I got from Javier M uh
[34:58] even though I'm I was never in Argentina
[35:00] I did not listen to like 20 30 50 hours
[35:04] of his interviews I just listened a
[35:05] little bit of it uh but that's kind of
[35:08] the RP that I get from
[35:10] him yeah good I I hope more countries do
[35:13] it because it's definitely worked for
[35:15] our Salvador yeah why not explore new
[35:20] options and I am a big believer in every
[35:24] country no um I'm a big believer that
[35:27] Bitcoin in a free market will always win
[35:31] like if you compare anything with
[35:33] Bitcoin in a free market Bitcoin Bitcoin
[35:37] will be
[35:38] so by far the winner that it will be so
[35:42] obvious that other countries don't even
[35:44] start with the free market then they
[35:47] just start with Bitcoin so that will be
[35:50] really interesting how this all shakes
[35:52] out and plays out uh it's uh for me in
[35:56] Austria people don't really realize it
[35:59] it's it's also in America in the
[36:00] elections uh it's already a topic here
[36:04] less uh in the European Union if in the
[36:06] elections is it's not a topic did you
[36:08] hear hear it heard it from politicians
[36:11] uh uh from you that they like talked
[36:13] about Bitcoin or is it also a non-topic
[36:16] I think generally Bitcoin in in the
[36:20] media is looked at quite negatively um
[36:24] especially looking at El Salvador when
[36:26] when we went through the bare Market a
[36:28] lot of media from America towards El
[36:33] Salvador was very negative saying oh
[36:35] he's a he's messed up here Etc um but
[36:39] you now now that they're up on their
[36:41] investment there's no news from America
[36:44] they're not mentioning it which I think
[36:46] is unfair but it
[36:49] just it just shows what what the media
[36:52] are about they they're focusing mainly
[36:54] on the negative stuff um but in the UK I
[36:58] I don't really I don't really know how
[37:00] Bitcoin is
[37:02] perceived from politicians I think the
[37:04] stuff I have seen is usually negative um
[37:09] but yeah I think that's going to change
[37:11] within the coming
[37:13] years um you guys are not no longer in
[37:17] the European Union um which is also
[37:20] interesting because this debate is now a
[37:22] little bit coming up in the because I
[37:24] think next week on Sunday uh so when
[37:27] this comes out it's kind of around the
[37:29] time when the elections are in the
[37:32] European Union also in Austria um what
[37:35] what do you think I mean this has
[37:37] nothing to do with Bitcoin but do you
[37:38] think it's a good idea that they they
[37:41] went out of the European Union and or or
[37:44] are you like you want back in what's
[37:47] your personal thing to be honest with
[37:49] you uh I don't really have much of an
[37:51] opinion on it I I don't really I don't
[37:54] really know enough about politics and I
[37:57] have hav't really taking the time to
[37:59] look into it
[38:00] because it sort of will make no
[38:02] difference to me um what happens um yeah
[38:07] what happens happens I guess um but yeah
[38:10] I haven't really taken too much of an
[38:12] interest in it um I just uh yeah
[38:17] just I don't know I don't really yeah I
[38:20] don't really know
[38:22] yeah just just pit I love that approach
[38:25] I was really involved in politics and
[38:27] that's why it comes up a little bit more
[38:29] because but since uh two and a half
[38:33] years something like that uh I'm not
[38:35] really involved in any politicians uh
[38:38] things uh I still vote this this vote
[38:42] was the one one vote where I'm like does
[38:44] it really make sense to vote like does
[38:46] it matter but I still voted but yeah but
[38:49] that's also something that when you say
[38:52] did you did not notice a big difference
[38:55] uh this also says a lot about about the
[38:58] uh the brexit and will be interesting
[39:00] how how this goes I feel like the
[39:01] European Union does not really
[39:03] understand Bitcoin and it's it bothers
[39:05] me and it it's it's it's so sad to see
[39:08] that uh we could go because we lost the
[39:11] internet we we could at least go uh went
[39:16] go on the horse a little bit earlier on
[39:18] on the Bitcoin cycle but America is a
[39:21] little bit further ahead and Salvador
[39:22] and other countries are even further
[39:24] ahead yeah yeah and perfect then uh then
[39:27] let's come to our end routine uh where
[39:31] the previous guest is asking something
[39:35] uh for the next guest and the question
[39:37] from the previous guest for you uh is
[39:39] what does Bitcoin mindset mean to you a
[39:43] great question Bitcoin mindset for me
[39:46] personally it's just
[39:48] uh I'm I'm kind of treating it as as my
[39:52] pension like like you said earlier I
[39:54] think as long as I have Bitcoin I'm
[39:56] happy uh I'm going to stack as much as I
[39:59] can for as long as I can and yeah I
[40:02] think with Bitcoin the future's bright
[40:04] really cool where can people um find
[40:07] more out about you and about Bitcoin
[40:09] racing where can people ask you
[40:11] questions yeah you can find us on
[40:13] Twitter at Bitcoin racing we have our
[40:15] website as well uh if you want to have
[40:18] any discussions you're more than welcome
[40:20] to send us a message we'll be happy to
[40:22] hear from you and
[40:24] yeah perfect then uh thank you
[40:27] thank you Chris for for being on and for
[40:31] everyone watching I'll
[40:33] be I'll be back tomorrow with another
[40:35] episode bye-bye
