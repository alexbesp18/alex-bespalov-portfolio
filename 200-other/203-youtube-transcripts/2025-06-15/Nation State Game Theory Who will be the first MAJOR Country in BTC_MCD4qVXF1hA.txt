[00:00] what I can tell you the Mexican
[00:01] politicians that are in power right now
[00:03] are aware of this those countries who
[00:06] adopt Bitcoin and embrace Bitcoin also
[00:08] Bitcoin companies will long-term be
[00:10] better off for Mexico this is still
[00:13] going to be another cycle for that to be
[00:15] to the level that it is in the US here
[00:17] today same thing happens with companies
[00:19] right if micro strategy adopts it he
[00:21] knows other CEOs then all of a sudden
[00:24] there are like 50 companies 100
[00:25] companies that game theory is playing
[00:27] out if Germany moves or like America
[00:30] moves then yeah Mexico also moves
[00:31] Austria also moves when Austria also
[00:33] moves maybe Italy looks a there those
[00:34] Ripple effects of the game
[00:37] [Music]
[00:40] the uh I want to talk with you about
[00:43] Bitcoin culture uh you even gave a talk
[00:46] that I saw uh about how we can onboard
[00:49] people with uh culture to bitcoin which
[00:52] is fascinating uh so first thing what is
[00:56] amazing or why is the Bitcoin culture
[00:59] itself really cool we're starting
[01:03] hot so I was I do have to give you a
[01:06] little bit of background of where I was
[01:07] born on why the importance of of culture
[01:10] so I was born and raised in uh
[01:13] Mexico born in guara the state of
[01:15] halisco but grew up in Mexico City and I
[01:19] understand that most cultures have an
[01:20] attachment to to their you know
[01:24] traditions and whatnot but man I think
[01:27] few cultures identify as strongly to
[01:30] their connection of what they do on a
[01:32] daily basis than uh than Mexico so
[01:36] there's this thesis of I mean and I'm
[01:39] I'm going to connect it to uh to bitcoin
[01:41] at the very end but there are things
[01:43] that are just part of daily life in in
[01:47] Mexican culture whether it's the cuisine
[01:50] right the food uh certain types of music
[01:53] which you can include Mariachis and
[01:54] rancheras and you know that kind of
[01:56] stuff that you probably see on on movies
[01:58] and and television and and then there's
[02:00] games that have been played for really
[02:03] if we dig if we dig into history for
[02:05] centuries one of these games is uh leria
[02:09] and uh as a bitcoiner now that I've
[02:11] studied also the history of where this
[02:13] game comes from I've seen it since I was
[02:15] a little kid and I continue to see
[02:17] it I think there's an opportunity for
[02:20] for an entire country to adopt and get
[02:22] into Bitcoin by combining the two so
[02:27] that's uh you know and we can take it
[02:29] from there but but yeah I mean growing
[02:31] up again in a in a country where culture
[02:34] is
[02:36] everywhere there are options that have
[02:38] not been explored when it comes to the
[02:41] history of of why it's so important to
[02:45] to to dive into uh into Bitcoin and uh
[02:49] and culture in this case which this
[02:51] theia game that I uh that I will get
[02:54] into what is the what is the L what is
[02:57] that yeah so are you familiar Robin with
[03:01] uh with
[03:03] bingo with Bingo yeah yeah like you have
[03:07] to uh have like four in a row and then
[03:09] you go Bingo like I I I I know it a
[03:12] little bit I saw it in movies but I
[03:14] never really played it like I it feels
[03:17] like it's always portrayed as an uh
[03:19] elderly
[03:20] sport in the in the US that is the case
[03:23] yeah so in the US there's this game
[03:25] called Bingo as you mentioned everybody
[03:27] that plays it has a board or a table
[03:29] with multiple numbers and there's rows
[03:31] and columns and and there's a guy in the
[03:34] front that spins a wheel a number pops
[03:37] and then if you have that number then
[03:38] you match it and then people stamp it so
[03:41] that's the the American version of of of
[03:43] bingo right now go down south to Mexico
[03:47] and the rest of Latin America there is a
[03:50] version of that but instead of using
[03:52] numbers we use images right and these
[03:55] images throughout history have been
[03:58] changed by the church by the military by
[04:02] retail this game is called leria not
[04:05] Bingo it dates all the way back to the
[04:08] 15th century which started in Italy the
[04:11] Royals played it it was supposed to be a
[04:13] really Elite uh game then from Italy it
[04:18] transferred over to Spain and the
[04:20] Spaniards played it 16th century 17th
[04:22] century obviously they conquer the the I
[04:27] guess the at the time they called New
[04:29] Spain
[04:30] which is now Mexico and the rest of
[04:32] latam the reason why we speak Spanish is
[04:34] because of because of Spain and they
[04:36] bring this game to this part of the
[04:38] world for for another couple of
[04:41] centuries it was still played by royalty
[04:44] and by the elites later on the Catholic
[04:47] Church adopted it to teach some of the
[04:51] the locals what Christianity symbols
[04:54] represented what it meant and it was
[04:57] just an easy way they they couldn't read
[04:59] but they could they could show images
[05:02] symbols and
[05:04] traditions later on this is now after
[05:06] Mexico becomes independent during the
[05:09] Revolutionary War the military provides
[05:12] games to the soldiers and this is the
[05:15] first time in history that it's being
[05:16] passed down from royalty to just the
[05:19] plebs right so here you go there's a
[05:21] revolutionary war every soldier gets a
[05:24] set and that's the game they would play
[05:25] so they would play during you know
[05:27] downtimes and whatnot the game gets
[05:29] popularized so much that when the war is
[05:32] over soldiers come back home they bring
[05:35] the game they show it to their families
[05:37] and families fall in love with it and
[05:39] for the next couple of decades it keeps
[05:42] expanding then it gets adopted by
[05:45] different types of festivals different
[05:47] types of parties and now it's not just
[05:49] the Royals and the plebs it's everybody
[05:52] then in the
[05:53] 1950s retail started adopting it to
[05:56] start selling products so now we have
[05:59] again the Royals and the church military
[06:03] and now retail and one of the first
[06:05] companies that started doing this was
[06:07] the I guess the equivalent to
[06:10] um what is this Big Brand in the US
[06:12] that's McCormick right mccormic sells a
[06:14] bunch of Mayas and and canned goods so
[06:17] in Mexico it was a French immigrant uh
[06:21] Clement St jocks that sold canned goods
[06:25] canned tomatoes canned corn canned beans
[06:27] and and so on and so on
[06:30] and this is the first person that
[06:31] incorporated it with marketing and
[06:33] started selling it as a hey here's a
[06:35] game here's a couple of images you know
[06:38] play and and win different
[06:41] prices this game has been so so relevant
[06:44] throughout history up until today that
[06:46] in the last 10 15 years both Google and
[06:49] apple have spent fortunes doing
[06:51] marketing research in Mexico and lamba
[06:53] specifically in Mexico and their
[06:55] conclusion has been the same they always
[06:57] arrive at oh let's let's do a leria
[07:00] campaign so back in 2019 Google had a
[07:02] big leria campaign and this this year
[07:05] 2024 Apple's biggest campaign in the
[07:09] country for their iPhone was based on
[07:12] leria so I I think my my point here is
[07:15] this is a game that has been played for
[07:16] centuries it has been adopted by all
[07:19] sorts of Institutions and it hasn't been
[07:22] given a Bitcoin treatment so we believe
[07:25] that by doing that we want to be the
[07:27] ones to do that obviously the market
[07:29] will decide but we're incorporating a
[07:31] combination of memes topics characters
[07:35] the white paper and so on and so on and
[07:38] but but I say when I say we it's a you
[07:41] know a company that we're running that
[07:43] we'll get to but anyways there's there's
[07:44] this thesis of culture has to be mixed
[07:47] with Bitcoin instead of just trying to
[07:49] orange pill an entire country because
[07:51] it's Freedom money can we learn
[07:54] something from the adoption of that game
[07:58] uh that we might corporate in uh making
[08:02] Bitcoin uh adopted it feels like yeah
[08:04] there's like bunch of people and then it
[08:06] was like a small circle the small circle
[08:08] was so fascinated by it then they
[08:11] explained it to their family to the
[08:12] loved ones it's kind of the Cross
[08:14] movement of Bitcoin can we learn
[08:15] something from that history of game to
[08:18] bitcoin our opinion is yes and which by
[08:20] the way we just launched I mean we've
[08:22] been testing for a couple of months uh
[08:26] about eight months but uh but yeah I
[08:28] mean the the biggest Learning lesson
[08:30] here would be that instead of coming to
[08:32] your neighbor or to your cousin and
[08:34] trying to tell them hey read the Bitcoin
[08:37] standard right away is hey um let me
[08:40] tell you about Bitcoin oh you know what
[08:42] I I know I read about it it's too
[08:44] expensive I cannot get into it no no no
[08:45] no no hold on there's a way for you to
[08:47] get free Bitcoin or free SATs what is a
[08:49] SAT oh you don't know what that is you
[08:51] know what just download this app um you
[08:54] know it's l ohia i know what that is
[08:57] okay so just play it and then of course
[08:59] the idea is for someone that has never
[09:01] touched Bitcoin to open the phone
[09:04] download the app get exposure to the
[09:07] game recognize the type of Imaging and
[09:10] the type of design that leria has but
[09:12] with a Bitcoin twist so maybe there's
[09:14] one card that gets drawn that is the
[09:16] lightning Network oh you know a
[09:18] lightning Network so if you have the
[09:20] card you tap on it and what we do if
[09:22] it's a card that has been called and and
[09:24] it was drawn we give the user 100 SATs
[09:28] per card that gets matched
[09:30] obviously those cards can stack up based
[09:32] on rows based on columns the idea here
[09:34] is that someone that has never been
[09:37] exposed to bitcoin gets excited about
[09:39] getting free sets by by this
[09:41] congratulatory hey you just earned your
[09:43] first Bitcoin wait what what do you mean
[09:45] well I mean it's a fraction of a Bitcoin
[09:48] but if you want to keep stacking just
[09:49] keep playing the game as the price keeps
[09:52] going up definitely interest goes up and
[09:56] eventually give the user the ability to
[09:58] say okay now that you see that your 100
[10:01] SATs is 10,000 SATs how would you like
[10:04] to really learn more about Bitcoin
[10:06] within our app we have a a feature that
[10:08] also explains the origins of money and
[10:11] the difference between crypto and
[10:13] Bitcoin and so on so all of these
[10:15] Concepts come in steps it's not just all
[10:18] at once but but the biggest learning
[10:21] here is you already love a game Why not
[10:25] start learning about Bitcoin by just
[10:28] getting free Bitcoin in the process I
[10:31] love that gamifying aspect of it I think
[10:34] gamifying education is uh I like it's
[10:38] often more like it's often even simpler
[10:41] than educating people like we have to
[10:44] get people familiar with the with the
[10:47] words of Bitcoin and with the symbols of
[10:49] Bitcoin I think that's even like a very
[10:52] first and very nice step towards nobody
[10:55] not not everyone will know about AUST
[10:57] economics and will be really deep the
[11:00] Bitcoin small Elite so I think like even
[11:03] a game that doesn't educate at all but
[11:08] makees something with like a lightning
[11:09] network with Bitcoin with satosi just
[11:11] with the with the words in there I think
[11:13] that does already a lot in onboarding
[11:16] people I love that a lot really cool
[11:18] what you're doing that's cool Rober
[11:20] thank you yeah the market will decide
[11:22] right but but yeah it's uh you know at
[11:25] the end of the day we're we're not even
[11:26] a gaming company that's uh that's just
[11:28] an element we strongly believe to be
[11:31] powerful because culture I mean it it
[11:35] connects us and it's not it's not a
[11:37] temporary phase right culture will be
[11:40] here once we're gone so so we we we hope
[11:44] that this can bring laughter and it can
[11:46] bring those concepts of of you know
[11:48] characters in the Bitcoin space whether
[11:50] it's memes or some of the ogs and then
[11:53] also more complicated topics as we move
[11:55] along there's just for the record
[11:57] there's 54 cards in a coin
[12:00] game and each player has access to a
[12:03] board that has 12 cards the nice thing
[12:07] about doing it this way is we can always
[12:09] rotate those cards right now we have our
[12:12] what we call the Genesis Edition but we
[12:14] can always rotate them into more
[12:15] advanced concepts or into even future
[12:18] collaborations with other Bitcoin
[12:19] companies really really cool um I'm also
[12:22] big on on trying to get as many
[12:24] different views and perspectives uh as
[12:26] possible on bitcoin and how they look at
[12:30] Bitcoin so I'm really curious as you are
[12:33] brought up in in Mexico and I think you
[12:36] still live in in Mexico I live in Austin
[12:39] but I go back and forth okay okay so but
[12:41] you're still like really familiar with
[12:43] with Mexico um how has the upbringing in
[12:46] Mexico living in Mexico influenced your
[12:49] understanding of Bitcoin that might be
[12:51] different to someone living in Europe
[12:53] America Canada Africa
[12:56] whatever yeah I I I like this question
[12:59] because this is one that could be
[13:01] considered uh it's not controversial but
[13:05] the reality is the the whole story we've
[13:08] we've been telling people about banking
[13:11] the unbanked that that's that's actually
[13:14] not quite true and this is this is
[13:17] something that even as a as an
[13:18] entrepreneur and as a bitcoiner I I'm
[13:21] guilty and my co-founder who is also
[13:23] Mexican we've been guilty of of that
[13:26] narrative and that's just not true um
[13:29] the the reality is Mexico has a lot of
[13:31] limitations there's a lot of opportunity
[13:34] but one of those does not come in just
[13:37] banking the own bank I I know it was the
[13:39] case for El Salvador where I believe
[13:41] that the percentage of people who didn't
[13:43] have access to a bank account and have
[13:44] never had one was over
[13:47] 70% in Mexico you can go to a local
[13:51] 7-Eleven or it's called the oo and you
[13:54] can have access to a portion of the
[13:56] banking system by just exchanging in
[13:59] cash so so that that story is is not
[14:02] quite true uh the one thing that I can
[14:05] that I can share with you in terms of of
[14:07] Mexico and and mixing it with the
[14:09] adoption of Bitcoin it's that it's very
[14:11] confusing it's just very very confusing
[14:14] it's very frustrating if you live in
[14:17] Mexico and you hear about Bitcoin and
[14:20] you want to get into it there is an
[14:22] exchange that offers you that capability
[14:25] but the problem is when you open that
[14:27] exchange there 's a 100 million options
[14:30] to buy
[14:31] things as an investor that maybe hasn't
[14:34] taken the time to study what the
[14:36] differences are between tokens and nfts
[14:38] and Bitcoin and everything else it's
[14:40] just too much man and and and people in
[14:43] the past have just like we have here in
[14:45] you know in the US people lose their
[14:47] money I mean there's even tokens where
[14:49] you know soccer is a big deal in uh in
[14:51] Mexico and there's apps where you open
[14:54] the you know the The Exchange access and
[14:57] you see maybe your favorite soof soccer
[14:59] team so you think you're buying maybe
[15:01] stock of the company but really it's a
[15:03] token that's attached to three other
[15:05] tokens and when people find out their
[15:07] experience with Bitcoin just gets has a
[15:10] really negative uh
[15:12] connotation which uh which is something
[15:15] we're trying to change but um yeah I
[15:18] would say it's a mix of confusion and
[15:20] frustration and in the options you can
[15:22] do currently in in Mexico wait there's
[15:26] there's no Bitcoin only company in
[15:29] Mexico that offers a Bitcoin exchange on
[15:32] ramp there's not
[15:34] no
[15:36] wow like Mexico I don't know how many
[15:39] people live in Mexico so there's 130
[15:42] million people in Mexico and then
[15:44] there's an additional 30 million
[15:45] Mexicans living in the US so if we take
[15:48] that as a unit there's 160 million
[15:51] Mexicans oh man that's that's crazy I'll
[15:54] tell you something Mexico let's say 130
[15:59] million people in Mexico or Mexicans in
[16:01] the world and then there is Austria with
[16:05] 8 million people we have two in Austria
[16:10] from Austria Bitcoin only exchanges yeah
[16:14] and they're completely purely Bitcoin
[16:16] only like they're doing nothing else
[16:18] they just like they're educating people
[16:19] on self custody they're doing really
[16:21] good they even operate Bitcoin etms and
[16:23] stuff like that um so it's always
[16:26] fascinating for me how um how is it not
[16:29] possible like like there are Mexican
[16:33] bitcoiners a lot like for example
[16:35] yourself uh and in Bitcoin exchanges
[16:38] especially I see it they they're running
[16:40] really good they are uh profitable
[16:42] businesses it's it's fascinating for me
[16:44] how this is not a thing in Mexico do do
[16:47] you have access to bitcoin only
[16:49] companies like strike or something like
[16:51] that there is access to those um the
[16:54] only I guess at the current state of the
[16:56] of the country the a is still quite
[16:59] limited because Mexico ironically has
[17:03] one of the more strict laws when it
[17:06] comes to operating uh a financial
[17:08] institution or technology company in
[17:10] fact there's a there's this law called
[17:13] the fch law and without that license
[17:17] it's almost impossible to operate I mean
[17:20] it's almost impossible the the license
[17:23] itself has driven away many companies
[17:27] that that I'm a big fan of right they
[17:28] have been inspirational to me whether
[17:30] it's you know the rivers or the strikes
[17:32] or you know any other super Bitcoin
[17:35] Maxis that have wanted to to tap that
[17:38] that
[17:38] market um this fintech license has
[17:41] really pushed away because of the
[17:44] difficulty the time it takes the
[17:46] regulatory uh and of course the expenses
[17:48] to get to get that in motion I mean we
[17:51] are in process of getting that as well
[17:53] so we we know firsthand how how
[17:57] difficult this is to to have
[18:00] so it's an a regulatory policy problem
[18:03] and not like oh nobody wants to do
[18:07] it yeah it's I think it's a combination
[18:10] It's a combination but yeah the
[18:11] regulatory is is definitely it's not
[18:14] friendly it it's not friendly it's meant
[18:17] to to be as impossible as as it comes um
[18:22] the ones that do achieve it which we
[18:25] hope to be in that group I mean it's
[18:28] it's going to be special uh when we do
[18:32] hopefully in the next few months and
[18:33] whoever comes after it will be special
[18:36] and I'm rooting for all of us that are
[18:38] Bitcoin only companies to to get that
[18:41] then the market can decide you know
[18:43] which one of us is offering better
[18:44] products or service or whatever but but
[18:46] at the end of the day the more Bitcoin
[18:48] only companies that make it into into
[18:51] into
[18:52] Mexico man the better it would be for an
[18:55] entire nation it's interesting because
[18:57] you also move back and forth between
[18:59] Austin and Mexico and we have always
[19:02] this game theory F in mind where those
[19:05] countries who adopt Bitcoin and embrace
[19:08] Bitcoin also Bitcoin companies and those
[19:10] those countries will long-term be better
[19:13] off that's kind of the game f aspect of
[19:15] like then forcing the countries that
[19:17] were opposed to bitcoin then all of the
[19:20] sudden wants to go into Bitcoin because
[19:21] they don't want to miss out um Can can
[19:24] you talk about that game theory maybe
[19:26] even like with with uh America now if
[19:29] Trump is elected if he really goes ahead
[19:32] and is a pro Bitcoin president with AFK
[19:35] also with RAV and all the all those
[19:38] people in there um that that game fa
[19:40] playing out maybe directly with like
[19:42] America and Mexico on on a on on a
[19:45] border Edge like it's a really
[19:46] interesting uh I think case study yeah
[19:49] that's super super interesting because
[19:51] I've been uh you know back and forth but
[19:53] the last core of the you know 15 plus
[19:56] years I have spent the majority in the
[19:58] us and I don't remember having Bitcoin
[20:02] as a piece of conversation during the
[20:04] last electoral process in in the US at
[20:07] all uh you know to to be in this
[20:10] position where like you said you know
[20:12] Vivic ramaswami and and and of course
[20:14] Trump I mean he still he still needs
[20:16] work to get there you know he still
[20:19] needs some work and and I know he's he's
[20:21] getting some hate on on Twitter because
[20:24] of the upcoming you know project of
[20:27] course we hate it like as big coiners we
[20:29] hate it having said
[20:31] that I I messed up as a bitcoiner too in
[20:34] the past where I did lose money trying
[20:37] to be cute and trying to make a quick bu
[20:40] on on some other altcoins if you know if
[20:43] it's not allowed to to cuss on here so I
[20:45] mean I understand I I understand I'm not
[20:47] saying it's it's okay because obviously
[20:49] those types of people have such a big
[20:51] platform that the communication that
[20:54] they provide could be you know it ruins
[20:57] other people's lives but the fact that
[20:59] it's even a topic it's it's just
[21:02] shocking man now for Mexico this is
[21:06] still going to be another cycle for that
[21:08] to be to the level that it is in the US
[21:11] uh here today what I can tell you
[21:14] without naming
[21:15] names is that the the current
[21:18] Administration in Mexico who just
[21:20] switched but it's still part of the same
[21:21] political party it's not aof and it's
[21:24] not aarant of what's happening there
[21:27] just has to be strategy and the way it's
[21:30] communicated
[21:32] um I couldn't tell you a a timeline of
[21:35] when those things will will maybe come
[21:37] to light but the Mexican politicians
[21:40] that are in power right now are aware of
[21:42] this it's just not going to be a PR move
[21:45] because living so close I mean we're
[21:48] neighbors with the with with the US has
[21:51] a lot of pros and
[21:52] cons Mexico could never pull a move like
[21:55] El Salvador for example I mean it's it's
[21:59] as of today or as of this year Mexico
[22:02] became uh the US's number one commercial
[22:05] partner surpassing China China has been
[22:09] the one the number one for for the last
[22:10] 25 years so because of that relationship
[22:14] it's not something Mexico can just come
[22:16] out and say you know what screw you USA
[22:18] we're going to adopt Bitcoin as legal
[22:21] tender or something along the
[22:24] lines but there's some good stuff
[22:26] they're they're not unaware of the
[22:27] importance of it
[22:30] so in a way because of the dependency
[22:34] it's then also when the US moves likely
[22:38] that Mexico also moves on on that front
[22:41] you nailed it you yeah you nailed it
[22:43] 100% it's almost as if there still has
[22:46] to be the approval of you
[22:49] know the the power above I I mean and I
[22:53] would imagine that would be the case for
[22:54] a lot of countries right so so it is it
[22:56] is a good thing that that it's being
[22:58] talked about right now even with some
[23:00] confusing messages uh it it is great
[23:03] having RFK on on that side too also not
[23:07] perfect but getting through that process
[23:09] of of learning the difference between
[23:10] Bitcoin and
[23:12] crypto I think it's really really
[23:14] positive and I'm I'm super excited to
[23:16] see where this goes yeah it's it's an
[23:18] interesting ripple effect that that can
[23:20] happen within countries because uh I
[23:23] mean the same thing happens with with
[23:25] companies right if micro strategy adopts
[23:27] it he knows other
[23:29] uh then all of a sudden there are like
[23:31] 50 companies 100 companies then maybe a
[23:34] big one moves I don't know make maybe
[23:36] Michael Dell with Dell is moving soon
[23:39] with with with Bitcoin adoption that's
[23:41] rumor yeah that's a rumor that's a rumor
[23:44] definitely I like that but I think it's
[23:47] such a rumor that we can say it's true
[23:51] we just don't know when it will happen
[23:54] yeah like I think it's pretty obvious
[23:56] that Michael Dell will do something with
[23:59] Bitcoin we don't know what exactly he
[24:01] will do probably uh he has talks with
[24:05] Michael zaor I imagine probably he is
[24:08] aware of that US dollar is not the best
[24:11] vehicle to store value and probably he
[24:14] will buy some Bitcoin at some point in
[24:16] time maybe we hear it even on the next
[24:18] conference calls like when Q4 Q3 ends I
[24:21] don't know no glue just speculation but
[24:24] the point is com corporations do that
[24:27] but also countries I know for example in
[24:29] Austria and Germany we both German
[24:31] speaking uh Austria is a very small
[24:34] country Germany a little bit bigger but
[24:35] also not that big um we we copy a lot
[24:39] from each other there's like a a lot of
[24:41] uh similarities between each other like
[24:43] from taxes and and the regulatories so
[24:47] it's interesting when like oh if if
[24:49] Germany moves or like America moves then
[24:51] yeah Mexico also moves Austria also
[24:53] moves when Austria also moves maybe
[24:54] Italy looks at it like there there's
[24:56] those Ripple effects of the game
[24:58] I I I really like to I really like to
[25:01] see those those those kind of things
[25:03] playing out in the positive for Bitcoin
[25:05] yeah no no you're right that that game
[25:07] theory is playing out we just wish it
[25:10] was faster right but but I mean it
[25:12] depends on how long how long have you
[25:13] been in Bitcoin alt together between you
[25:16] know even the altcoin seasons and all
[25:18] that stuff if you watch or listen to my
[25:21] podcast on a regular basis I guess you
[25:23] already bought some Bitcoin and now the
[25:26] most important step is to keep the
[25:29] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[25:31] wallet my personal recommendation for
[25:33] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[25:36] secure it's simple to set up it's also

[26:10] on where you live you even want to have
[26:12] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[26:15] move in case something goes really
[26:17] really wrong and through all those steps

[26:35] not least I have something completely
[26:37] new for you guys I partnered up with
[26:40] coin vigilante this is the most
[26:43] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[26:46] saw created by anyone look at that
[26:49] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[26:51] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[26:54] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[26:58] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[27:00] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[27:04] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[27:06] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[27:10] watch collections you have the date of
[27:13] the first ever Mind Bitcoin Block in
[27:16] there and of course also the block
[27:18] height and which EPO we are currently in
[27:22] I love the level of detail they put in
[27:24] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[27:27] check out those amazing amazing coin
[27:29] viland the time pieces down in the
[27:31] descriptions I love those watches so so
[27:35] much I have been uh invested in Bitcoin
[27:38] since four
[27:39] years I I heard about Bitcoin seven
[27:42] years ago but I never bought it since
[27:44] four years I needed I need I needed
[27:46] three years to get from Bitcoin as a
[27:49] scam to bitcoin might be something
[27:51] unfortun I know it's so tough man it's
[27:54] so tough yeah we all have our journey
[27:56] it's so tough do you see um a difference
[28:00] also in the people that you meet in
[28:03] America and the people you meet in
[28:05] Mexico in the understanding and
[28:08] acceptance of Bitcoin or is that just on
[28:11] a regulatory state level the the
[28:13] differences and the people actually are
[28:15] kind of the same no that that's actually
[28:18] that's a great question because it it is
[28:20] not the same I mean the the needs that a
[28:23] Mexican has are very different from from
[28:25] an American you know person dayto day
[28:28] and the same thing happens in El
[28:29] Salvador so for example the idea of
[28:32] investing for the future here in in in
[28:35] the US is I mean it's it's very strong
[28:38] right invest save it don't touch it and
[28:41] that'll be great because it's GNA go up
[28:43] that same story in most of land America
[28:46] doesn't apply to the majority of your
[28:47] population because people really do live
[28:50] paycheck to paycheck so instead of just
[28:53] hey save and then one day it'll be a lot
[28:56] I think it's more about the educ of what
[28:58] money is it's not just about save and
[29:01] become rich or save and you know it'll
[29:03] grow it really starts with hey have you
[29:06] wondered why your tortilla or you know
[29:09] people buy tortillas all the time like
[29:11] in the in a kilogram have you have you
[29:13] noticed that it's gone up aren't you
[29:16] worried about this is you think that
[29:18] there's something that it should be done
[29:20] I think it starts from those Basics not
[29:22] not really the idea of byy now and don't
[29:25] touch it and hudle for for many many
[29:27] years for the majority of the population
[29:29] there are some wealthy individuals of
[29:31] course but but for the majority it it
[29:34] really has to start with with hey this
[29:37] is messed up how can you make your money
[29:41] spread out more than it did you know
[29:43] five years ago now Mexico is it's an
[29:45] interesting example though because
[29:47] Mexico's economy has actually done
[29:50] better over the last 67 years than most
[29:54] Latin American countries the rate of
[29:56] inflation is lower in Mexico the PES has
[29:58] appreciated more than other currencies
[30:01] uh but at the same time they're still
[30:03] experiencing that phenomenon of of well
[30:06] but what you know what what what what
[30:07] else can I do with my money right and
[30:11] and I mean for us it's too obvious to
[30:12] think well it's just just by
[30:15] Bitcoin but then you have that
[30:17] introduction of oh there's Bitcoin and
[30:18] there's a million tokens that is where
[30:21] the confusion and their frustration that
[30:23] we're trying to to clear or at least
[30:25] help people get educated on on what
[30:27] those differences are absolutely really
[30:30] cool and you you kind of touched on a
[30:33] little bit on what you're doing but uh
[30:36] what companies and what uh other things
[30:39] are you working on in Bitcoin yeah yeah
[30:41] so um just in you mean in the space as
[30:44] far as the startup life of yeah so I'll
[30:47] uh yeah I mean maybe I'll take like a
[30:49] few minutes and kind of give you the
[30:51] super the tldr of of my past life but
[30:55] you're gonna laugh Robin because it's
[30:56] this is pretty Fiat but my my past three
[31:00] jobs before Bitcoin my three three prior
[31:03] careers before Bitcoin were as Fiat as
[31:06] they come I mean like super Fiat I
[31:09] worked for the banking industry I worked
[31:11] for marketing analytics and social media
[31:14] listening which is really a type of
[31:16] surveillance and I also work for the CSR
[31:19] ESG space I mean all of them like all
[31:22] three of these are like the most scam
[31:24] Fiat things that I mean that I can think
[31:27] of today right as as a big corner but at
[31:29] the time you know they were uh that that
[31:32] was life and uh you know I did this from
[31:35] from uh from the US I was responsible
[31:37] for developing the goto Market strategy
[31:40] for three different companies going into
[31:42] latam starting with Mexico and then the
[31:45] expans the expansion of these companies
[31:47] into the rest of latam or at least you
[31:49] know 12 countries so you know I did this
[31:53] three times and by the fourth time I had
[31:55] an opportunity to go to another startup
[31:58] I was already into Bitcoin and you know
[32:00] you start thinking I wanna I want to do
[32:02] something in this space I want to
[32:04] contribute I just don't know what that
[32:07] something is and fast forward moved to
[32:10] Austin I started connecting with I don't
[32:12] have you ever been to Austin by the way
[32:15] I unfortunately haven't been to America
[32:16] at all uh but uh my first small step
[32:21] will be in November in adopting Bitcoin
[32:24] that is not the states but it's likeor I
[32:27] will El Salvador in adopting Bitcoin uh
[32:30] in November that's like the closest I
[32:32] have ever been to America and I have
[32:35] just been confirmed as a speaker for
[32:38] Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas uh so I will
[32:41] be in Bitcoin also in in Las Vegas in
[32:45] America that will probably be my first
[32:48] ever trip to America so your first trip
[32:50] to the US is gonna be in Vegas that's
[32:54] crazy that's cool man oh that's really
[32:57] cool yeah St team Bitcoin is a great
[32:58] conference I'm a huge fan uh of of what
[33:01] they're doing down
[33:02] there um so oh that that that's really
[33:06] cool so I was going to mention about
[33:07] Austin you have to make it down to
[33:09] Austin at some point there's a lot of
[33:11] bitcoiners living there building there
[33:14] whether it's you know exchanges or
[33:17] non-custodial
[33:18] account companies and reward companies
[33:22] and then there's ple lab and there's
[33:23] Unchained and zap R there's a bunch of
[33:26] stuff happening but anyway I moved I
[33:28] moved to Austin I start connecting with
[33:30] bitcoiners and uh you know while being
[33:33] there I expressed yeah I want to build
[33:34] something in Bitcoin I just don't know
[33:36] what it is most likely it should be a
[33:38] Bitcoin only exchange for Mexico but I
[33:40] don't even know where to start and from
[33:43] from living there people started
[33:45] connecting me to you know you need a
[33:47] co-founder and uh and then a friend that
[33:50] uh you know Tony from mudy Tony from
[33:53] from who Mutiny Mutiny wallet uh no I
[33:57] don't I think so okay so he no worries
[34:00] he's down there and he um yeah he
[34:02] basically tells me hey you know if you
[34:04] want to build something I think there's
[34:05] a guy you should give a call he's also
[34:08] Mexican um and he has experience working
[34:10] with Bitcoin companies you guys need to
[34:12] connect sounds like you have similar
[34:14] ideas for goals so call them up uh we
[34:17] synced up and we thought okay I I you
[34:19] know we're going to build a a Bitcoin
[34:21] only exchange and you know it's really
[34:23] nice because at the time we thought oh
[34:24] this is the idea but then we find out
[34:26] there's so much more to do do right
[34:28] which is why we started with the game as
[34:29] of right now we're not live for the buy
[34:32] and sell it has taken so long because of
[34:34] the reg regulatory aspect
[34:37] but um it's it's funny how co-founder
[34:41] also Mexican but we met because of
[34:43] bitcoiners living in
[34:46] Austin I mean that that only happens in
[34:48] in Bitcoin right where bitcoiners tell
[34:51] you hey you you need to talk to this
[34:52] other person that's going to help you
[34:54] and uh you know fast forward uh today we
[34:58] uh we're building what we call you know
[35:00] that it gets confusing because it's not
[35:01] just an exchange we're building a
[35:03] Bitcoin Neo bank so what does that mean
[35:06] exactly it means that once we have the
[35:09] license our customers will be able to
[35:11] buy and sell Bitcoin they'll be able to
[35:13] convert their Bitcoin into Pesos and
[35:16] they'll be able to open checking
[35:17] accounts saving accounts and have a
[35:20] debit card within the country all of
[35:22] this cannot happen without the fch
[35:24] license which is why it's it's so
[35:26] important and so powerful to to have
[35:28] that now here's the one where I do get a
[35:30] little bit sometimes of a I wouldn't
[35:33] call it hate but it's it's a question
[35:35] that comes up in in Mexico most people
[35:39] with with with money have been investing
[35:41] in uh in Mexican treasury bonds that
[35:45] that's what Mexicans do and they haven't
[35:47] stopped and they're probably not going
[35:49] to stop right now because someone just
[35:51] told them that Bitcoin is going to
[35:54] 200,000 however one of the things that
[35:56] has come up during mon months and months
[35:58] of research is if we provide the ability
[36:00] to to these types of investors to give
[36:03] them access to that from one app so you
[36:06] know they go to Yaki they download the
[36:08] you know the application they buy
[36:10] Bitcoin and within a week they notice
[36:13] that they made 10% on their investment
[36:15] if they can use that 10% and invest it
[36:18] into Mexican t t bills that's something
[36:22] that no one else is doing today now on
[36:25] the flip side if they also wanted to
[36:27] invest maybe 5% into a Mexican T Bill
[36:30] and then the 5% to buy some Tesla stock
[36:33] they could do that from a app too today
[36:35] it's very difficult for Mexican
[36:37] investors to have access to the US Stock
[36:40] Market and that's something we're
[36:41] providing them now eventually the goal
[36:45] is to slowly educate them educate them
[36:47] into okay well clearly your Bitcoin
[36:50] position is outpacing everything else if
[36:54] you really think long term then it's
[36:56] time for you to at more into Bitcoin but
[36:59] that's that's going to take time that's
[37:00] going to take time why are Mexicans so C
[37:04] about t bills in in Mexico because the
[37:09] the the return on investment has been on
[37:11] average 10 to 13% the last 10 years same
[37:14] it's yeah like in Austria know the the
[37:19] the usual way of people investing the
[37:21] money is either ETFs or real estate so
[37:24] buying their own home is usually
[37:28] how people save money I completely
[37:31] disagree with that but people use their
[37:34] own home as this savings account which I
[37:37] think is an horrible idea uh but most
[37:40] austrians do that because real estate
[37:42] has been giving amazing returns over
[37:44] like the last 30 40 years interesting
[37:47] you know in Mexico okay so let's talk
[37:50] about real estate too that's another big
[37:51] investment in Mexico but most most
[37:54] wealthy families in Mexico or height
[37:56] netw worth in indviduals the majority of
[37:59] of of of this group already owns their
[38:02] home like it's completely paid off
[38:05] whether it came from inheritance or it
[38:08] was just the purchase as a gift from
[38:10] from the parents also you know from the
[38:11] same line of work and we're talking of
[38:13] course wealthy wealthy Mexicans so the
[38:15] remaining the remaining money they have
[38:17] is really to invest in other assets and
[38:20] they're just not going to go all in into
[38:22] Bitcoin that that's going to take time I
[38:24] mean we we hope to be the ones that can
[38:26] say hey if you want to buy Bitcoin you
[38:28] get it from y Pocky everything else sure
[38:31] yeah go out there and buy if I mean if
[38:33] you still want to gamble with tokens and
[38:34] nfts we don't think it's smart but I
[38:38] mean it's free market so do what you
[38:40] want we're just not going to provide
[38:41] that the the t- bills that is something
[38:44] we would because you've been doing it
[38:45] for for many years so let's make it
[38:47] convenient for you and let us show you
[38:50] why it's best to invest in in Bitcoin
[38:54] and it's also a clever way to introduce
[38:57] um Bitcoin and make it easier for people
[38:59] to switch because then it's uh just a
[39:02] click and not like a new platform and
[39:03] stuff like that so I think it it could
[39:06] be a very uh good strategy and we we
[39:08] kind of have to be like I hate it when
[39:11] people um on other people just
[39:14] because they they do something for
[39:16] Bitcoin in a way they disagree with so
[39:19] there's a lot a lot of this uh and I
[39:22] think everyone that is positively doing
[39:25] something and honestly doing that for
[39:27] Bitcoin that's a positive even if
[39:30] someone would disagree with that they
[39:32] should accept that they are doing
[39:33] something for Bitcoin and that's good
[39:35] for them also you to you took the words
[39:37] out of my mouth because you know it's
[39:40] it's so different man being on on
[39:42] Twitter just as a you know as someone
[39:45] that's posting all day because I've done
[39:47] it right before having the
[39:49] company it's it's it's great because
[39:52] philosophically you really feel like
[39:54] you're in a different standard and you
[39:56] feel like everything else is just soft
[40:00] par which is you know the reason why we
[40:02] wanted to build something but once you
[40:04] start playing the game man I mean it it
[40:07] it's we we had no idea how difficult it
[40:09] would be to to overcome some of the
[40:11] regulatory you know difficulties on the
[40:13] kyc AML loss you know so it's either
[40:16] it's either quit doing what we're doing
[40:19] or play the rules some of them and then
[40:22] eventually get to that uh you know to
[40:25] that next phas so I I I totally agree
[40:27] with you because I remember being a
[40:29] person that thought ah this is this is
[40:31]  or this is crazy and and then
[40:33] you're on the other side and you're like
[40:34] oh man I I I just can't get past the
[40:38] certain step if I don't you know if I
[40:40] don't follow these rules it's it's a
[40:43] tough game man I I I I do feel I you
[40:46] know someone tells me oh so you're doing
[40:48] kyc and my answer is yes and they tell
[40:50] me you know F off like I I hear you I I
[40:54] understand I
[40:55] understand it's uh it it's funny because
[40:59] last
[41:00] year um I was only on Twitter and didn't
[41:03] do the podcast I mean I started the
[41:05] podcast in December but most of the year
[41:07] I didn't do the podcast and I was just
[41:09] on bitcoin Twitter and I was that one
[41:12] toxic Bitcoin
[41:14] Maxi that that you're right now talking
[41:17] about um but uh the I have then in
[41:22] December started the podcast uh so it
[41:24] has been like 10 11 months now that I
[41:26] have the podcast
[41:27] I have done uh you my 280th episode
[41:31] actually uh so I have 280 people
[41:34] interviewed already in Bitcoin builders
[41:37] in Bitcoin people that that do something
[41:39] people that are connected somehow with
[41:41] Bitcoin that has their own perspectives
[41:44] and the funny thing that happened my
[41:46] view on bitcoin and the world economy is
[41:49] way more realistic than it was like 10
[41:51] months ago um and I I'm way more I'm way
[41:56] less aggressive and way more um I I
[42:00] became more of a free market maximalist
[42:03] I would say and way more of like let's
[42:05] let's let's do let's let C people cook
[42:09] and we will see what meal we were eating
[42:11] in whatever is the best thing like it's
[42:13] like a buffet everyone can cook uh and I
[42:16] will try from everything a little bit
[42:19] the best thing I I like I will get for a
[42:22] second round or third round and yeah if
[42:25] you have if you're building a Neo bank
[42:28] that has t bills and stocks also on the
[42:31] app and you also onboarding like two
[42:34] million Mexicans every month to bitcoin
[42:37] like good good for you good for Bitcoin
[42:40] and good for everyone like no nobody
[42:42] nobody's saying anything bad about that
[42:43] I feel like go yeah no I I like how you
[42:47] put it I like the the buffet style I I
[42:50] like it yeah man it's it's just
[42:51] different when you when you do it on
[42:53] your own and you know and some people I
[42:54] I know some toxic Maxis too
[42:57] that have even defended certain points
[43:00] like you just did and say you know what
[43:02] if you don't like it then go out and
[43:03] build something better it it's a free
[43:05] market go go out there yes maybe
[43:08] criticize a project but then go out
[43:10] there and execute it it's it's a just
[43:11] it's just a very different game but uh
[43:14] yeah I like the buffet I'm gonna have to
[43:15] steal that
[43:17] Robin you can go ahead and do that yeah
[43:20] I also like that's that's one thing I
[43:22] really uh let's get it out of the system
[43:24] what I yeah what I dis like sometimes
[43:28] about the community I think the true
[43:31] Spirit of Satoshi is to give uh and
[43:36] don't expect to get credit or anything
[43:38] like that so that's why the podcast I
[43:40] produce every day an one hour podcast I
[43:43] said to everyone and I also put it in a
[43:45] YouTube license take it whatever you
[43:47] want like if you want to take the clips
[43:50] or you want to take the whole thing just
[43:51] like take it republish it I don't care
[43:54] do whatever you want with it it's it's
[43:56] an open Source podcast do whatever you
[43:59] want with it um so uh a lot of people
[44:03] don't get that and before I was on the
[44:06] other side where I took clips from
[44:07] podcast and really like uh and other
[44:11] people were commenting on like oh you
[44:13] have to credit him I'm like why like why
[44:16] do I have to do it and then I kind of
[44:17] stopped and and now I don't repost
[44:20] anything I only produce original content
[44:22] because it was pissed and it just Liv
[44:24] And it lives in YouTube yeah yeah it
[44:26] just lives in live and and I say like
[44:28] people just take my things it's the true
[44:30] Spirit of
[44:31] Satoshi Satoshi is still till now still
[44:35] not known he just provided Bitcoin for
[44:37] the world and still didn't took any
[44:40] credit for it and I think that's the
[44:41] true Spirit uh doing something for the
[44:45] world without taking the credit for it I
[44:47] I just I don't know why but it came out
[44:49] right now yeah no that's good it's uh I
[44:52] like it it's the spirit of Open Source
[44:53] and yeah I mean if there's something
[44:55] else out there then just go out and do
[44:57] it so this is your contribution we're
[44:59] trying to put our contribution and and
[45:01] so are so many other people whether it's
[45:04] Tech or podcasters or you know gaming
[45:07] companies exchanges it it's a big effort
[45:09] it's amazing though by the way how how
[45:12] far we've come I mean because sometimes
[45:13] you know Cycles happen and you know I
[45:15] did mess up and as I said a lot of us
[45:18] bitcoiners did touch the out coins and
[45:21] and that and to just think back and say
[45:24] man it's it's been it's been a while
[45:26] that's why I was curious you know how
[45:27] long you've been I guess a Bitcoin Maxi
[45:29] or you know a full
[45:31] bitcoiner it's it's just crazy
[45:33] absolutely yeah and yeah I've
[45:35] been I'm definitely 100% in in in
[45:39] Bitcoin now one question that I have uh
[45:41] before we come to the end routine of of
[45:43] the podcast is as you are a business
[45:46] operator you you have a lot of
[45:48] experience in Mexico and America how do
[45:51] you think uh Bitcoin will impact
[45:54] businesses overall the business world
[45:56] the investment world World The Venture
[45:57] Capital world the the building startup
[46:00] world yeah well I can tell you firsthand
[46:02] because we have gone through different
[46:04] phases I think man we we can say so many
[46:07] just just the textbook Bitcoin things
[46:10] right but at the end of the day just
[46:11] from my personal experience building a
[46:14] Bitcoin only business is that I think it
[46:18] sets everything back into into a place
[46:21] of you got to be humble you got to be
[46:23] open to learn new things i' I've always
[46:27] been intrigued by history because I have
[46:30] a dad who's a Libertarian so growing up
[46:33] I was always exposed to all these
[46:35] theories and I hated it by the way when
[46:37] I when I was when I was young I hated it
[46:39] I always thought my dad was crazy he was
[46:41] a
[46:42] contrarian but the older I get and the
[46:44] closer I get to bitcoin I I see the
[46:47] benefits it brings into my life and I
[46:49] say my
[46:51] friendships my my health uh my my
[46:54] curiosity about what really is is
[46:58] happening in the world not just what's
[47:00] textbook recommended because of a class
[47:04] so I think if we can apply those same
[47:07] Concepts into into just real life it's
[47:09] going to be it's going to be a long time
[47:11] man but but but when we see and you've
[47:13] talked to 286 people on the podcast
[47:16] before me when you see the passion that
[47:18] we put into this thing that is bigcoin
[47:22] it affects everything we do so now
[47:24] translate that into the business world
[47:26] and if businesses can be more careful
[47:28] and more humble into structuring hiring
[47:32] educating instead of just you know
[47:34] there's a difference between delegating
[47:36] and then also coaching and teaching what
[47:38] like for example a task is instead of
[47:41] just oh this is my day please go do this
[47:44] there's the process of hey you know we
[47:46] need to achieve XYZ let me show you why
[47:49] now go execute it come back I'll give
[47:52] you feedback and then if you're still
[47:54] stuck let's let's educate each other
[47:56] I've been very fortunate to be around
[47:58] amazing bitcoiners I I'm shocked we
[48:00] didn't know each other before Robin so
[48:02] I'm glad that now we've connected but uh
[48:05] you know at times or Once Upon a Time
[48:07] the the first OG bitcoiners that were
[48:11] very welcoming that really inspired me
[48:13] to you know to really do something about
[48:16] pick or something in the space were Max
[48:17] and Stacy like those two who have I
[48:21] don't know how many millions of
[48:23] bitcoiners they
[48:25] created I I I think it's we can apply
[48:28] that into how is it going to affect the
[48:31] future of businesses and the way they
[48:32] operate I think it's in that just
[48:36] exploring that we can do so much more I
[48:39] mean and I know it's cheesy but for me
[48:41] it has affected me personally in every
[48:43] facet of my life it has been uh has been
[48:46] that I love it a lot really really cool
[48:50] and now let's come to the end routine
[48:51] and I think the the first question of
[48:53] the end routine uh suits really nicely
[48:55] here what can we learn from you besides
[48:59] Bitcoin well this is your typical like
[49:01] with your hobbies and
[49:04] whatnot it's like that interview uh you
[49:06] know I uh I'm just really passionate man
[49:09] I I I love I love life you know if it's
[49:12] if it's not just Bitcoin i i in general
[49:14] I just love live I'm completely
[49:16] dedicated to my family and my friends so
[49:19] if uh I just I just have a deep
[49:21] connection with people I know I kind of
[49:23] brought this at the beginning of the of
[49:25] the call or the the part where uh where
[49:27] I mention culture is so important to you
[49:30] know to to Mexicans but on a personal
[49:32] level I I I feel like uh yeah I'm I'm
[49:35] someone that I I enjoy connecting with
[49:37] with people and because of that and the
[49:39] and the culture I love to cook I I love
[49:42] to cook uh if if there's if there's a
[49:45] scenario in in in the Bitcoin life where
[49:48] I get to cook for
[49:50] bitcoiners past our uh I guess past this
[49:53] Venture life that that'll be a dream
[49:55] come true I I I really enjoy en that
[49:58] building yeah man I
[50:00] know I I love it a lot so uh in opening
[50:04] a Mexican uh Bitcoin restaurant I would
[50:08] love it um perfect then let's come to
[50:11] our end end routine where the previous
[50:13] guest is asking a question for the next
[50:14] guest without knowing who the next guest
[50:16] actually is and the question from the
[50:19] previous guest for you is how would your
[50:21] life be different had you not discovered
[50:24] Bitcoin completely different
[50:27] completely different um this is this is
[50:30] awesome question by the way I would
[50:32] probably be you know 25 35 pounds
[50:36] heavier um I wouldn't be building a
[50:40] company in in a really difficult space
[50:42] but at the same time getting the rewards
[50:44] of how amazing it is to connect with
[50:46] people um I would not be imagining The
[50:50] Impossible today I you know I I think
[50:53] any idea that that me and my co-founder
[50:55] have had we
[50:57] don't think it's
[50:58] impossible
[51:00] um and I would not be connecting with as
[51:02] cool as people as I am today it it would
[51:05] be very different up and down man up and
[51:07] down uh yeah forget about the
[51:10] libertarian aspect of it I don't want to
[51:12] say uh I don't want to think this way
[51:14] but maybe I would even be considering
[51:17] about uh living in a gigantic gigant
[51:20] because I live in Austin which is a big
[51:22] city but in a gigantic City where I
[51:24] cannot enjoy the outdoors and whatnot it
[51:26] would be so different it everything
[51:28] would be different we'll be spending
[51:30] tons of money on things I don't need
[51:32] yeah yeah I mean you name it I like the
[51:34] the view of that really cool perfect and
