[00:00] answers come from outside the current
[00:02] paradigm and that's what Bitcoin is is
[00:04] it's a bridge to that next paradigm and
[00:06] you know trying to solve those questions
[00:09] from within is like trying to push a
[00:11] dead car from within sitting in the
[00:13] passenger seat pushing on the dashboard
[00:15] trying to make the car move. I think
[00:17] Bitcoiners when we adopt a low time
[00:19] preference you know we start to see the
[00:21] value and hey wait I really should start
[00:23] focusing on myself and and my health.
[00:26] Self- Bitcoinization is a look at the
[00:29] psychology of incentives that have
[00:32] created the money systems that govern
[00:34] the current world. And I believe Bitcoin
[00:36] is a a bridge to the next paradigm,
[00:39] which is a paradigm of abundance and
[00:42] hope. You know, I probably have enough
[00:44] Bitcoin, but I wouldn't know because I
[00:46] don't spend it. You know, I save it.
[00:48] It's savings technology. I'm going to
[00:49] save it for my son. And so, I still work
[00:51] and uh it's not like I'm buying things
[00:54] with it.
[00:57] [Music]
[00:59] Hi Noah. How are you doing? Everything
[01:01] fine on your end? Robin, it's great to
[01:03] be here and I really appreciate the
[01:05] invite. Yeah, it's it's a beautiful day
[01:07] here in Denver, Colorado. Really cool.
[01:10] Um, in the starting, what is kind of
[01:13] your background? How did you get to to
[01:15] Bitcoin and and what's kind of your your
[01:17] your basis of your understanding of
[01:19] Bitcoin?
[01:20] Yeah, absolutely. uh 2015 I was working
[01:24] a night shift in the emergency
[01:25] department. I'm an ER doc, so I've been
[01:28] an ER doc for about 20 years. Uh and it
[01:31] was a relatively rare, quieter shift
[01:35] where I wasn't seeing too many uh
[01:36] patients late late at night. And um I
[01:40] did that TV show American Ninja Warrior
[01:42] for for many seasons. Uh, and one of the
[01:45] f my fellow ninjas on the show who ran
[01:47] the obstacle course, um, we were talking
[01:50] late at night and he was like, "Oh, have
[01:52] you you know this cryptocurrency? It's
[01:54] it's a real thing. It's really
[01:56] important. Do you know what it is?" And
[01:57] now I've I'm not into magic internet
[01:59] money and it's weird. And but he
[02:02] convinced me um that it was the future
[02:04] and that I should buy
[02:06] Ethereum. And uh, so of course I bought
[02:08] some Ethereum. It was probably 30 or $40
[02:11] at the time. And uh I looked at Bitcoin
[02:15] and I think it was $7, $800 or $1,000,
[02:19] something like that. And maybe I bought
[02:21] one or two and uh and yeah, I saw that
[02:25] and I kind of forgot about them and uh I
[02:28] just kind of held on to uh a little bit
[02:30] of it and then I watched the 2017 go up,
[02:34] sold it, thought I was a superstar for
[02:37] making, I don't know, 50% or double my
[02:39] money or something along those lines.
[02:42] and then um you know bought more because
[02:45] it kept going up and then it all crashed
[02:48] and I lost money and I sold it and it
[02:52] wasn't
[02:53] um you know right away that I understood
[02:56] it. It's like most people and they say
[02:57] you know you get Bitcoin at the price
[02:59] you deserve. Well, uh I did buy some
[03:02] more after losing a bunch and and just
[03:04] sat on it. Um, and then by the time
[03:07] COVID hit, I really had time to uh see
[03:11] the world imploding and everything was
[03:13] crashing. So, I bought a whole bunch of
[03:15] gold and silver and Bitcoin. And then I
[03:18] had time uh and so I really started
[03:20] reading and getting into it. And so,
[03:22] even though I had been kind of roughly
[03:25] buying and selling, I had no idea what
[03:27] it was until about
[03:28] 2019. Um, and then I went in big and
[03:33] I've been buying um ever since. And I've
[03:35] learned hard lessons along the way and
[03:38] I've I've come to understand it in a a
[03:41] lot different context. And uh you know
[03:44] I'm I'm in a funny place now where I I
[03:47] think like a lot of people who have been
[03:49] in and out of it for 10 years or at
[03:51] least for the last six um I have a lot
[03:55] of Bitcoin and you know I probably have
[03:58] enough Bitcoin but I wouldn't know
[04:01] because I don't spend it. I don't you
[04:03] know I save it. it's savings technology.
[04:05] I'm going to save it for my son. And so
[04:06] I still work and uh it's not like I'm
[04:10] buying things with it. Uh so yeah, that
[04:13] was kind of my path and my journey. And
[04:15] now I feel uh an obligation to to kind
[04:19] of contribute to the thinking of it. Now
[04:21] that I've put in thousands of hours of
[04:23] study and riding on the backs of all
[04:25] these intellectual giants, you know,
[04:27] it's very interesting to want to
[04:28] contribute to the zeitgeist around uh
[04:31] Bitcoin. Yeah. you mentioned uh a book
[04:35] that you're you're writing or you
[04:37] already published. Uh uh what is that?
[04:41] Yeah. So um it's called self-
[04:44] bitcoinization. And just like we talk
[04:46] about hyper bitcoinization, which is a a
[04:49] term that was coined over a decade ago.
[04:52] uh self- bitcoinization is more of an
[04:55] inwardfocused
[04:57] uh self-actualization through bitcoin
[05:00] because bitcoin is a very very powerful
[05:03] tool for introspection and to understand
[05:06] human incentives
[05:08] um you know and I think we're all so
[05:10] used to having grown up in a world where
[05:13] our value is constantly debased you know
[05:16] we measure net worth in money in in in
[05:19] dollars whether or not it's right I
[05:21] don't think think it's right. But we
[05:23] measure net worth in dollars. We measure
[05:25] a country's growth in GDP and it's
[05:28] always progress progress, you know, and
[05:30] like what what are you worth? And you
[05:32] know, you talk, oh, I'm worth, you know,
[05:34] $10 million or whatever you're worth.
[05:36] And it's kind of silly that we ascribe a
[05:39] a monetary value to it. you know, you
[05:42] should be able to say I'm worth, you
[05:44] know, like a thousand units of joy and
[05:47] like happiness and peace and love and
[05:49] and uh I think we would be happier um in
[05:52] that kind of a world and I think Bitcoin
[05:54] does eventually get us there. But self-
[05:56] Bitcoinization is a look at the
[05:59] psychology of incentives that have
[06:02] created the money systems that govern
[06:04] the current world. And I believe Bitcoin
[06:06] is a um a bridge to the next paradigm
[06:11] which is a paradigm of abundance and
[06:13] hope and and um abundance mentality. Uh,
[06:17] and so I talk a lot about a lot of new
[06:20] concepts in self-dinization, but at its
[06:23] core, it's a um a tool, a way to use
[06:27] Bitcoin to self-actualize and become um
[06:31] the most authentic and genuine version
[06:33] of yourself and the best version of
[06:35] yourself. Has it is this a book where
[06:39] where you uh think a non- Bitcoiner
[06:43] would also like benefit from from that
[06:46] of like finding yourself? Is it more on
[06:48] the psychology side or on more on the on
[06:50] the Bitcoin side? You know, it's both.
[06:53] It's uh philosophy, uh art, love, uh
[06:58] morality. There's a chapter on morality.
[07:00] There's a chapter on healthcare and
[07:01] medicine. Um it's it the first half of
[07:05] the book is uh more of what's wrong with
[07:09] the system, what's wrong with fiat, uh
[07:12] what's wrong with you know uh how does
[07:15] fiat uh or you know money by decree, how
[07:18] does that um debase our morality and how
[07:22] is Bitcoin a Trojan horse for morality
[07:26] and how does it uh change us as people
[07:29] and how does it moralize not only us but
[07:32] societ society. Um, and so I think that
[07:35] it appeals to a wide audience. It's
[07:37] also, you know, like there's a lot of AI
[07:40] art. Um, I I've kind of started to gain
[07:43] a popularity on uh on X and and
[07:47] elsewhere for uh making a lot of uh uh
[07:50] AI uh art and and so it's like a hard
[07:54] coverver coffee table philosophy
[07:57] um book with poetry and art and musings
[08:00] on uh how to become the best version of
[08:03] yourself. And there's a lot of stories
[08:04] from uh my life. I just turned 50 years
[08:07] old and uh it's been an incredible life.
[08:10] uh and I've got a lot of stories to tell
[08:13] that I think uh will help people avoid
[08:15] mistakes that I made, but you know, also
[08:18] focus on living with an abundant
[08:20] mentality. And so I think it appeals to
[08:22] a wide audience of both Bitcoiners and
[08:24] and non- Bitcoiners alike and doctors,
[08:27] too. Wow. 50 shocked me. It you look
[08:31] like 30.
[08:33] Thank you, brother. Yeah, my uh the love
[08:35] of my life. She she has me. I'm actually
[08:37] gray here, but I dye this. And so I I
[08:40] just dyed it. She likes when I dye it.
[08:43] So, but you know, I climb I rock climb
[08:46] non-stop. And I'm still climbing at a
[08:48] very high level. And um I was never the
[08:51] best climber, but uh unless you uh
[08:55] measure it by joy received uh per hour
[08:59] climbing and then I might be the very
[09:00] best. So um yeah, no I I I try and live
[09:06] a really healthy life and everything in
[09:09] moderation, including moderation. So
[09:12] even moderation. Thank you for the
[09:13] compliment. Yeah.
[09:16] Um it's so interesting because like
[09:19] health and diet is also a really popular
[09:21] topic within Bitcoin and I think the
[09:24] financial security that you get from
[09:26] Bitcoin allows you to actually spend
[09:29] time also in like okay what do I
[09:32] actually get into my uh body because I
[09:36] see a lot of Bitcoiners after they get
[09:38] the value of Bitcoin the next thing they
[09:40] get is the value of time and they're
[09:43] like okay I got the financial energy uh
[09:46] part right now. It's like how can I
[09:49] explore more of the time? I have to
[09:52] really care for myself. That's a really
[09:54] interesting thing that happens with
[09:55] Bitcoin.
[09:57] Yeah, it is the low time preference as
[09:59] we say, which is, you know, when I first
[10:01] heard low time preference, I actually
[10:03] for some reason that didn't click, but
[10:05] you can just think about it as long-term
[10:08] thinking or long-term mentality. And
[10:11] yeah, you know, it's it's so funny
[10:14] because I think it's so easy for us,
[10:17] especially in the states, uh, but maybe
[10:20] everywhere to be so hyperfocused on
[10:23] hoarding and accumulating wealth and,
[10:25] you know, uh, storing for tomorrow
[10:28] because because of scarcity mentality
[10:31] and, uh, scarcity mentality has evolved
[10:34] over hundreds of thousands of years of
[10:36] evolution. uh and we are hardwired to um
[10:41] to hoard and to believe that we don't
[10:44] have enough and that's why billionaires
[10:46] keep making more and more and that's why
[10:48] people are you know like Scrooge and you
[10:51] know uh store all their money and and um
[10:54] you never have enough and it's fiat
[10:56] thinking that you never have enough
[10:58] Bitcoin or you never have enough money
[11:01] um and so you know uh I'm trying to live
[11:05] a really truly abundant life because we
[11:08] have abundance. And uh you know, yeah,
[11:11] you always want more money, but if
[11:13] you're always putting things off for the
[11:15] future, then you're not living in the
[11:16] now. And the now is really ostensibly
[11:20] when everything happens, right? Like uh
[11:23] the past hap, you know, it's like you
[11:25] can't dwell on the past really. I mean,
[11:27] you can learn lessons from it. And the
[11:29] future hasn't happened and it's
[11:30] something like if you're always looking
[11:32] for then you're kind of missing the
[11:35] right now. And right now is abundant and
[11:39] it's a gift. It's, you know, it's the
[11:41] present, right? It's it's a gift. And
[11:44] health is is like the the preeminent
[11:48] feature of enjoying the now. Uh and
[11:52] enjoying the now uh as long as you can.
[11:56] Um, and if you're like me, completely
[12:00] addicted to this fantastical dream or
[12:03] simulation or whatever this is, you're
[12:05] going to want to maximize your ability
[12:07] to enjoy the now. I love moving my body.
[12:10] I love being in shape. I love, you know,
[12:12] um, uh, you know, just operating at a
[12:15] very high level. So, my my heart and my
[12:18] lungs have to be uh in very good shape
[12:21] and and I have to be able to like climb
[12:24] and run and jump and and do all the and
[12:27] play and do all the things I want to do,
[12:29] you know? I want to be able to make love
[12:31] for hours at a time, you know, like like
[12:33] I want to and these are things that, you
[12:35] know, we should all be excited to do and
[12:38] and um our health is one of the most
[12:40] important aspects of that. And I I think
[12:42] you're absolutely right. Um, I think
[12:44] Bitcoiners when we adopt a low time
[12:47] preference, you know, we start to see
[12:49] the value in, hey, wait, uh, I really
[12:53] should start focusing on myself and and
[12:55] my health, uh, mental health, physical
[12:58] health, spiritual health. And so, a lot
[13:00] of, um, what I talk about in
[13:03] self-coinization is how to achieve those
[13:05] things and what kind of daily um, you
[13:08] know, action plan can you make? You
[13:10] know, like they say, how do you eat an
[13:11] elephant? And the answer is one bite at
[13:14] a time, right? Or how do you climb
[13:16] Everest, Mount Everest, one step at a
[13:19] time. And so achieving that health and
[13:21] those goals for your personal happiness,
[13:23] personal growth, personal um whatever it
[13:26] is is is kind of a one day, one step at
[13:29] a time. And so I created an action
[13:30] journal called the SATS journal. Uh
[13:34] people will love this. Uh which is
[13:35] self-actualization through Satoshi. And
[13:38] it's a daily journal that I have in my
[13:40] book that says, you know, how many sats
[13:42] did you stack today and like, you know,
[13:45] what are good things that you did? What
[13:46] did you learn? And and and it's just a
[13:48] very short daily journal um to track uh
[13:52] your the evolution of uh your growth,
[13:56] your personal growth uh not only uh from
[13:59] a financial health standpoint, but a
[14:02] physical and mental health standpoint as
[14:05] well. So it's a it's a great question
[14:07] and yeah health especially as a
[14:09] physician you know that's why I wrote
[14:10] this book uh is because I think that
[14:13] that's the it might be the final
[14:16] frontier and ironically it's the second
[14:18] thing people think about after finance
[14:20] but it should be the first thing and I
[14:21] think Bitcoin ultimately will uh will
[14:25] show us that and and teach us that as a
[14:27] society.
[14:29] Wait what what do you mean the final
[14:30] final frontier?
[14:33] It's it's the joy and and and and what
[14:37] so I I think that um focusing on our
[14:41] health is ironically the final frontier.
[14:45] It should be the first thing we think
[14:47] about. But when you think about it, the
[14:49] fiat mentality has created a life in
[14:52] which all of us put health off to focus
[14:55] on the accumulation of of dollars or you
[15:00] know this constantly debasing value
[15:02] unit. It's insane. So we will go
[15:05] sleepless nights, we will be stressed,
[15:08] we will smoke, we will drink alcohol, we
[15:10] will do destructive behaviors and we
[15:13] won't focus on eating you know well. Um
[15:16] society is sick. Uh we are sick and uh
[15:21] this should be like the most important
[15:23] aspect of our life as like one of the
[15:25] foundational uh principles to our to our
[15:28] health and well-being and happiness. Um
[15:31] but because of our fiat mentality and
[15:33] the way we've grown up and because of
[15:35] scarcity mentality, we will actually
[15:37] push off health to be something that is
[15:41] um not as important as the accumulation
[15:43] as running in the the hamster wheel and
[15:46] trying to accumulate um you know net
[15:50] worth and more dollars. And it's very
[15:52] sad. Uh and so that's something that uh
[15:56] I I'm aiming to uh make an impact on and
[15:59] part of the reason why I wrote the book.
[16:01] You you said I think like two three
[16:03] times now scarcity me mentality. Do do
[16:07] you mean by that the that that someone
[16:10] thinks there's not enough for everyone.
[16:12] So that that we we kind of are limited
[16:15] in in our thinking or what do you mean
[16:17] with that? Great great question Robin.
[16:20] Okay. So imagine how long human beings
[16:23] have been around and existed. Um you
[16:27] know you and you can call it 50,000 100
[16:30] thousand hundreds of thousands of years.
[16:31] Okay? For the majority of that time life
[16:34] has been extremely hard. Winter would
[16:37] come. We would starve to death. The next
[16:39] clan over would come with their spears.
[16:41] They would take our women. They would
[16:43] take our children. They would kill us.
[16:46] Um you know we lived in the cave.
[16:48] Infection would kill us. our life
[16:50] expectancy was 30 or 40 years old. This
[16:53] was for the majority of humanity of and
[16:56] so our brains are wired for danger. And
[17:00] our brains are wired that if we kill an
[17:03] antelope or if there's food then just
[17:06] like a
[17:08] dog eat as much as you can right now
[17:11] because all you are guaranteed is the
[17:13] moment. And so we are hardwired to be
[17:17] gluttonous and and to be to be worried
[17:20] about the future. Okay? Um because we
[17:24] lived in caves and life was hard. So if
[17:26] you fast forward that all of our uh
[17:29] philosophies and languages and money
[17:32] systems are all derivative to that.
[17:35] They're all derivative to the fact that
[17:37] we've been scared and that uh you know
[17:40] and being scared or having scare is, you
[17:44] know, kind of like scarcity mentality
[17:46] like like we're scared of running out of
[17:49] stuff. So we hoard and we accumulate.
[17:52] And the moment we become abundant, that
[17:54] mentality doesn't change. And so what do
[17:56] we do? We keep hoarding more. We keep
[18:00] accumulating more. We keep thinking
[18:01] about how can we be safer? And so it's
[18:04] always a thought about not living
[18:06] abundantly in the present and sharing
[18:09] with everyone collaboratively, but it's
[18:12] still competitive and it's a zero sum
[18:14] game. It's a cutthroat PVP and fiat is
[18:19] all set up so that it's competitive.
[18:22] Everything is competitive. School,
[18:24] getting an A versus not getting an A,
[18:26] getting a job promotion, making more
[18:28] money, you know, how much money do you
[18:30] have? How many cars do you have? Do you
[18:33] have the Lambo? You know, it's all
[18:35] scarcity mentality and it's all fiat
[18:38] thinking. Um, and it's all based on uh,
[18:43] you know, uh, this this mentality that
[18:45] we don't have enough. So, abundance
[18:47] mentality is what technology gives us
[18:49] because it's truly deflationary. Uh, and
[18:53] Bitcoin is the bridge to help us uh,
[18:56] help allow us to enjoy an abundant life.
[19:00] And uh so I I speak about both scarcity
[19:02] mentality and abundance mentality at
[19:05] length in self- bitcoinization. Um and
[19:08] then the final chapter of the book is uh
[19:11] uh really kind of outlandish and out
[19:13] there and and most people have said no I
[19:16] just you know you're crazy but uh the
[19:18] last chapter of the book is called the
[19:19] death of money. And uh it might be crazy
[19:22] to talk about, but I I I think that it's
[19:25] possible that the ultimate um success of
[19:29] Bitcoin will be to make itself
[19:32] completely worthless and that money will
[19:35] become a footnote in history and we can
[19:37] perhaps obtain 0 point energy or a Star
[19:41] Trek like future where we don't need
[19:43] money. And uh that gets into a whole
[19:46] different conversation. But the fact is
[19:49] um there's a period between now and then
[19:52] uh where scarcity mentality um is
[19:57] becomes extinct hopefully uh because
[19:59] it's it doesn't help us and abundance
[20:01] mentality takes off. Uh, and I think
[20:04] Bitcoin is the bridge to abundance
[20:06] mentality. And I think we should all try
[20:08] and live abundant lives because, you
[20:11] know, the odds of us being here are so
[20:14] astronomically small. I mean, I think
[20:16] this is probably a simulation, but uh or
[20:19] a computer program or something. I I
[20:21] mean, who knows what this reality is,
[20:23] but the fact of the matter is the fact
[20:25] that you're here, you know, the the odds
[20:27] of that, like you could win the lottery
[20:29] every day from now until the end of your
[20:32] life. the power ball with hundreds of
[20:34] millions of dollars, you could win that
[20:36] every day from now until the end of your
[20:38] life. And that you would have better
[20:39] shot of of that than actually existing
[20:42] when you run the the math and the
[20:44] numbers. So it it's mind-boggling that
[20:47] we even exist and the gift of life and
[20:50] consciousness and the things that we can
[20:52] enjoy uh in this VR or game or reality
[20:56] or whatever it is uh is so incredible
[21:00] that it's it's to our benefit to live uh
[21:03] in a in a powerful and voracious and
[21:07] abundant way. And that's how we need to
[21:09] live our lives is
[21:11] authentically, genuinely. And you'll see
[21:13] that the people who are the loudest or
[21:16] the strongest voices out there are the
[21:19] people who are living the most
[21:20] authentically and have something to
[21:21] contribute because they're truly
[21:23] themselves. And so I believe the self-
[21:26] Bitcoinization process is a way to seek
[21:29] perfection of character and truly become
[21:31] yourself and live abundantly.
[21:34] Yeah. And I think we are drawn towards
[21:37] people that are completely true to
[21:39] themsel
[21:41] because M we we we want to do that
[21:45] ourselves but sometimes we don't have
[21:47] the courage to to be completely
[21:49] ourselves. So, so like seeing people
[21:51] that are really themselves and not
[21:54] nothing else is is is something truly
[21:57] amazing and and I'm really interested in
[22:00] in
[22:01] that scarcity and then going towards uh
[22:05] the the abundance um of future and maybe
[22:10] then even uh a future beyond money
[22:13] basically a death of of money. There has
[22:15] been one other guest, I'm trying to
[22:17] think of his his name. I don't remember
[22:20] who it was in the last 450 episode.
[22:22] There was one that also uh pointed that
[22:25] that out that he thinks that Bitcoin
[22:27] will actually lead to a moneyless
[22:31] society, I think he calls it. I I I
[22:33] completely forgot who it was. Um, but
[22:36] there was one guest that already uh
[22:38] mentioned that and I found it so
[22:39] interesting how Bitcoin can improve
[22:43] money so much that it might just
[22:46] eliminate money. That that that's it's
[22:49] beyond my imagination. It's I cannot
[22:52] imagine that. Uh but I'm open to the
[22:54] idea. Yeah. And and that's cool. And and
[22:57] of course it's not any kind of a new
[22:59] idea. I mean, like I said, Star Trek,
[23:02] Gene Rodenberry, uh, you know, thought
[23:05] of a future where, you know, when you
[23:07] watch Star Trek, any of the Star Treks,
[23:08] there's no money, you know, there's no
[23:10] like, um, and so that's very
[23:13] interesting. Uh, and, you know, there's
[23:16] some kind of barter system between alien
[23:18] species and you would need something
[23:20] like that. And then people bring up the
[23:22] point of like well you know coastal
[23:25] properties and you know things that have
[23:27] limited
[23:29] um you know a limited amount and and are
[23:32] truly scarce like a piece of art like
[23:35] the Mona Lisa that has to have value and
[23:37] there has to be a way to exchange value
[23:39] for that and I don't have all the
[23:40] answers but I guess um you know part of
[23:43] having a truly abundant mentality and
[23:46] achieving true abundance through
[23:49] technological deflationary
[23:51] um uh you know growth and and
[23:55] realization. I think I I think that you
[23:58] know you lose the desire to have
[24:02] um things that are status or ego.
[24:06] uh you know like um and I think that
[24:12] there's you got to be careful because I
[24:16] think people would
[24:18] um start to accuse you of you know you
[24:21] know like holding specific political
[24:23] ideologies if you started to say oh you
[24:26] know maybe we won't own anything and
[24:28] then people will start to think oh you
[24:30] won't own anything and you'll be happy
[24:32] and it's like yeah that could be like
[24:35] truly an evil thing. But then also like
[24:38] imagine if we all just own there were
[24:42] enough Lamborghinis and like if you
[24:43] wanted one you just you know pressed a
[24:48] order a Lamborghini for the day on your
[24:50] app and you know you didn't have to pay
[24:52] any money and a Lamborghini just drove
[24:55] up to your house and you took it in the
[24:56] mountains and you carved on the mountain
[24:57] roads. I mean, like, it's hard to
[24:59] imagine, but like I've I've had long
[25:01] conversations about this and and you
[25:03] have to really go down the rabbit hole
[25:04] for it to start to make sense. Um, but
[25:08] the, you know, it's truly very far away
[25:12] and I think it has less to do
[25:14] necessarily with Bitcoin than it does
[25:17] with like cold fusion and quantum
[25:19] computing and AI and um the fact that we
[25:23] won't likely need to be working in the
[25:26] next 10, 20, 50 years or whenever. Um,
[25:29] so at some point, you know, working will
[25:31] be completely optional.
[25:34] um you know and and um so it it's like
[25:38] kind of a logical kind of con um uh
[25:41] progression to think about living
[25:43] abundantly. But you know imagine if if
[25:46] you didn't have to work and you didn't
[25:48] need money. Imagine if you had unlimited
[25:50] money and you weren't like a psychopath
[25:53] driven um to move humanity forward
[25:57] because you know certainly there are
[25:59] those people but imagine you wanted to
[26:00] be a monk and uh you know I I think that
[26:06] uh or imagine you wanted to go climbing
[26:07] every day like I love rock climbing like
[26:10] I could have fun rock climbing every day
[26:11] for the rest of my life. I I love doing
[26:14] other stuff. I love writing. I love
[26:16] talking with people. I love
[26:17] relationships. I love learning. Um I
[26:19] still practice medicine. Uh even though
[26:21] I probably don't need to. Um I I enjoy
[26:25] being in the emergency department and
[26:26] seeing the stories, seeing and I'm at
[26:28] the top of my skills. I'm at the you
[26:30] know, I mean, I've been doing this for
[26:32] 20 years. Um I feel like I'm
[26:34] contributing to society when I save
[26:36] someone's life or, you know, it's it's a
[26:38] very good job. Um, and but I I get to
[26:42] choose my balance and it's challenging
[26:45] to try and live abundantly. Uh, but you
[26:48] know, like I've got, like I said, I have
[26:51] enough Bitcoin and I think everybody
[26:53] should feel like they have enough wealth
[26:55] and um, you know, like like you if you
[26:59] can't afford food and and you can't
[27:00] afford I I speak a lot in in my book
[27:03] about Abraham Maslo and the hierarchy of
[27:06] needs. You have to you have to have food
[27:08] and shelter. You you know in order to
[27:10] have um you know love and in order to
[27:14] have the higher things up the pyramid.
[27:16] And at the very top of the pyramid is
[27:19] self-actualization. Uh and and less than
[27:21] 1% of people are
[27:23] self-actualized. And it has nothing to
[27:25] do with IQ. It has nothing to do with um
[27:28] you know where you live or where where
[27:30] you are. Uh except for the fact that if
[27:33] you live somewhere that's like
[27:34] exceedingly poor and you are starving
[27:37] and you have to turn to a life of crime
[27:39] just to survive you know or begging in
[27:42] the street then you're not you're not f
[27:45] you know you don't have that base layer
[27:47] fulfilled. And so, you know, I was on
[27:49] the Breedlove podcast recently with the
[27:51] What is Money podcast, and we we talk
[27:54] about this a lot about the Maslo's
[27:56] hierarchy of needs, and I talk about it
[27:57] a lot in my book. Um, but but the fact
[28:00] of the matter is most of us um uh in the
[28:04] developed nations who are looking at
[28:06] Bitcoin and owning Bitcoin, most of us
[28:08] have the ability right now to be
[28:10] self-actualized. And we have abundance,
[28:13] you know, compared to somebody 300 years
[28:15] ago or compared to, you know, cave
[28:17] people or um you know, people 10,000
[28:19] years ago or 500 generations ago, we
[28:22] have abundance right now. And uh you
[28:26] know, another way to look at it is they
[28:28] say on on either side of the financial
[28:31] spectrum, there lies a leisure class,
[28:33] right? So at the very rich side, you
[28:36] could be you you've got all the money
[28:38] you need and you you could do whatever
[28:40] you want. you don't even need to work.
[28:42] But on the very other side of the
[28:44] financial spectrum, there's, you know,
[28:46] ex there's um hikers and climbers and
[28:50] surfers who barely make any money and
[28:53] don't want to work and have no interest
[28:55] in politics or money or this that or the
[28:57] other thing. And you know, maybe they
[28:59] have a few hundred bucks, but they're
[29:00] enjoy some of the happiest people you've
[29:02] ever met. And you could be totally
[29:04] self-actualized without without money.
[29:08] well, wi with just enough money to get
[29:10] by. Um, so you know, I I think that we
[29:15] build these fortresses. We all build
[29:18] these fortresses based on scarcity, uh,
[29:21] based on our fear of running out of
[29:24] resources. And the fact of the matter is
[29:27] um you know we we are mostly very very
[29:32] lucky and the actual bar for abundance
[29:36] is much lower than we think. And so the
[29:39] challenge is to become self-actualized
[29:41] and to become the best version of
[29:43] ourselves and to really really propagate
[29:47] love and happiness and um uh wisdom uh
[29:53] in an abundant way. And you know, it's
[29:55] it's it's harder uh it's easier said
[29:59] than done and it's harder than you might
[30:02] think to live truly abundantly. Uh but
[30:05] it's, you know, it's your living your
[30:07] best life when you can. Let's take a
[30:09] break for a moment and appreciate the
[30:11] beauty that Coin Vigilante has made with
[30:15] the Bitcoin watches. Those watches are
[30:17] the most amazing, the most elegant way
[30:20] of showing that you are a true
[30:23] Bitcoiner. and Coin Vigilante just
[30:25] dropped a completely new and amazing
[30:28] Genesis edition of their watch
[30:31] collections. You have the date of the
[30:33] first ever minded Bitcoin block in there
[30:36] and of course also the block height and
[30:39] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[30:42] the level of detail they put in in this
[30:45] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[30:47] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[30:50] down in the descriptions. I love those
[30:53] watches. so so much. And now if you have
[30:56] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[30:58] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[31:00] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[31:03] to deal with that. The first way is you
[31:05] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[31:07] entry for you to get into the
[31:10] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[31:13] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[31:16] super simple and secure way. And if you
[31:18] check out the link in the description,
[31:20] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[31:23] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[31:26] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[31:30] partner in terms of how to get the most
[31:33] out of your sovereignty. They will
[31:35] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[31:38] that is perfect for your individual
[31:41] situation. They will show you how you
[31:43] can secure your own devices. Securing
[31:46] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[31:48] have to keep all your devices secure.
[31:50] One topic that is overlooked often is
[31:53] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[31:56] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[31:58] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[32:01] place already? And last but not least,
[32:03] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[32:05] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[32:07] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[32:12] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[32:15] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[32:18] be for the first time ever speaking at
[32:21] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[32:23] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[32:26] really looking forward to seeing all of
[32:28] you there. You can get your ticket in
[32:30] the link down in the description of
[32:33] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[32:35] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[32:39] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[32:40] there. That's super interesting. Also,
[32:43] the the the way how Bitcoin can us can
[32:45] bring us there. One thing I have a
[32:48] really hard time understanding in that
[32:49] concept is
[32:51] the people have such a need right now to
[32:57] portray uh status that that's why they
[33:00] buy fancy watches, Lamborghini and and
[33:04] other things of of that sort. They it
[33:08] almost seems like money um is at some
[33:11] point just a ranking system. So, uh,
[33:14] there's like a line where you have food
[33:16] and shelter and and and you're good to
[33:18] go. And above that, it's just like,
[33:20] okay, where are you ranking? Is is like,
[33:23] are you number 1,100? Are you number
[33:25] 10,000? Um and and and I have a hard
[33:29] time thinking of a world where we don't
[33:34] have that natural money ranking system
[33:37] or do you think there will be a
[33:40] different ranking system or just like no
[33:42] not at all. So I talk about this a ton
[33:47] and I have uh two chapters developed to
[33:49] this and I have a thought idea that I go
[33:52] through um in in in the book and I'll
[33:55] summarize it. I'll give you the TLDDR.
[33:57] Uh, and one thing is I go to Burning Man
[34:00] every year. And at Burning Man, there's
[34:02] no money. It's totally decommodifi
[34:04] decommodi decommodified. Um, and there's
[34:08] no brands. There's no buying anything.
[34:10] It's a total gift economy. And there's
[34:13] no cell phones. There's no uh way to
[34:17] communicate except for sitting down and
[34:18] talking with people. you ride around on
[34:20] bikes and and talk about people but uh
[34:22] and talk with people uh and you talk
[34:25] about philosophy and love and you you
[34:27] make incredible relationships and and
[34:30] people who actually uh um really grow
[34:34] and you know I I I go there every year
[34:36] and I ride around at uh 5:00 a.m. in the
[34:39] morning, you know, after a whole night
[34:42] rolling on Molly and uh go to the temple
[34:46] and and find my death, you know, and
[34:48] like I'll I'll really think about my
[34:50] death and my place in the universe and
[34:53] um I'll cry and it's just really an
[34:55] incredible experience. Um in my book, I
[34:59] spend some time with a thought
[35:01] experiment and the thought experiment
[35:03] goes like this. Imagine instead of being
[35:07] raised with parents who were worried
[35:10] about money, talking about money, uh
[35:13] talking about their jobs, having to go
[35:15] to work, having to slave away, um
[35:18] talking to you about getting the best
[35:20] profession, talking to you about being
[35:22] smart and making money and investing and
[35:25] everything. Money, money, money, money,
[35:27] everything being predicated on money.
[35:29] you got to get a, you know, everything
[35:32] um being predicated on money. Imagine
[35:35] instead being raised by, let's say, some
[35:38] Bitcoiners or in a moneyless world, but
[35:41] let's say Bitcoiners um and you have a
[35:43] mother and father and you're very very
[35:45] young, they don't work, but uh you know,
[35:48] mom writes poetry. Uh mom and dad love
[35:52] to go mountain biking.
[35:54] um you know instead of going to school
[35:56] this is like a hyper bitcoin hyper
[35:58] bitcoinized future let's say instead of
[36:00] going um to school um you go to these uh
[36:05] you know AI helps you learn you've got
[36:07] AI learning assistants and uh you're
[36:10] constantly having organized uh kind of
[36:13] like social uh playdates with um instead
[36:17] of it being called school it's maybe
[36:20] called something else but um there
[36:22] there's no emphasis on grades. There's
[36:24] no competition
[36:27] um in in in the way of like having to
[36:30] succeed uh or having to, you know, get
[36:34] into a certain college or having to have
[36:36] good enough SAT scores or or you know
[36:39] this this ranking system that ultimately
[36:42] does come down to money um and resource
[36:45] accumulation. But instead, you know,
[36:48] you're going on vacations. Uh you're
[36:50] learning constantly philosophy and
[36:53] wisdom about the world. Uh you're you're
[36:56] enjoying life, and you never
[36:59] even think about money or hear about
[37:01] money. Um it's not even a thing that's
[37:04] on your radar. uh instead you're um
[37:09] you're living an abundant life where
[37:10] there's plenty of food uh there's
[37:13] happiness and you know out of this uh at
[37:17] some point your parents ask you what do
[37:18] what do you want to do with your life
[37:20] now? Oh I want to I want to snowboard. I
[37:23] think I want to do that for a while. Um
[37:25] but I would love to start learning more
[37:27] philosophy. You know, you can imagine
[37:30] that that your goals might be to help
[37:34] people because it feels good, you know,
[37:37] or to to really be in love or to have a
[37:40] bunch of, you know, to have a big family
[37:42] or, you know, one of these non a goal
[37:47] that has nothing to do with the
[37:48] accumulation of wealth or status uh or
[37:52] anything like that. And for that reason,
[37:54] like you don't need to have four houses
[37:57] all over the world. I mean maybe maybe
[38:00] if you wanted to dedicate your life to
[38:02] travel you would but maybe most people
[38:05] don't necessarily you know so like you
[38:08] you have to start thinking of being
[38:11] raised in environment and being
[38:14] socialized where you aren't um always
[38:19] looking to the next thing and trying to
[38:21] make it to the next level whether that's
[38:23] like a competitive level of academic
[38:26] success or a degree
[38:28] ree which gives you more status make
[38:31] makes you a more attractive mate to
[38:33] someone else you know but instead you
[38:36] can focus on yourself a authentically
[38:39] and you know instead of 1% of people
[38:42] being
[38:43] self-actualized maybe because of
[38:45] technology and bitcoin maybe 99% of
[38:49] people or 85% or whatever um maybe
[38:52] there's a more egalitarian distribution
[38:54] of resources across society so that base
[38:58] layer of food and shelter. Maybe
[39:01] everybody has that
[39:03] because why wouldn't they? Why wouldn't
[39:06] we? You know, maybe maybe all of a
[39:08] sudden it's not so important to have
[39:10] somebody worth, you know, a trillion
[39:12] dollars. Uh but everybody has enough um
[39:18] resources to at least have a roof over
[39:20] their head and healthy food and educ
[39:22] access to education if they want access
[39:24] to health care. Um these things are not
[39:28] possible in a competitive uh scarcity
[39:32] mentality society where you literally
[39:34] have to step on top of others and it's a
[39:36] zero- sum game. uh you know like when
[39:39] people are like the best traders and
[39:41] they make the most money through trading
[39:43] it's because you know or they're the
[39:45] best CEO and shareholders are making
[39:48] money it's because they're they're
[39:49] stealing time from workers and everybody
[39:53] is benefiting from the hard work and
[39:54] toil uh from the people who are slaving
[39:58] away and that's happening you know
[40:00] whether it's you know slave labor in
[40:03] China or you know so it's it's a real
[40:07] problem and So again in my book I talk
[40:10] about instead of capitalism because I
[40:12] don't think capitalism exists. I think
[40:14] capitalism is like an idea. I think
[40:16] right now we have crony capitalism. I
[40:18] think we have this fake kind of
[40:19] regulated BS um where the winners are
[40:23] chosen. But I think that um you know I
[40:27] don't think uh communism or socialism
[40:30] are good either. Uh, I think that all
[40:33] those centralized political ideologies
[40:35] are just as bad because they're all
[40:37] corrupting. And I think if we have a
[40:39] decentralized political ideology, which
[40:42] I call energism, um, so like capitalism,
[40:45] socialism, it's a decentralized form
[40:48] that is closer to capitalism than
[40:49] anything else. Uh, then we could provide
[40:52] a base layer of resources to everyone
[40:55] across society in a more of a
[40:57] collaborative and abundant uh, fashion.
[41:00] And I mean, it's kind of a dream, but I
[41:02] think Bitcoin takes us there because
[41:03] it's an egalitarian system rooted in
[41:07] math and code that is a consistent
[41:12] measuring stick. And I think that's the
[41:14] bridge from the first paradigm which is
[41:17] scarcity, fiat,
[41:20] fearbased to the future which may be
[41:23] moneyless um which is abundance and uh
[41:28] technology and resource and energy
[41:31] abundance and I think Bitcoin is that
[41:34] bridge that takes us there and uh um
[41:38] yeah I I mean I I hope it happens
[41:41] because if it doesn't happen. Um, you
[41:44] know, everybody who's trying to solve
[41:46] the problems of the current uh disaster,
[41:49] which is which is uh malappropriation of
[41:53] resources and and wealth and uh total
[41:57] moral debasement of all society. If it
[42:00] you know right now trying to solve those
[42:02] problems um from within the current
[42:05] paradigm cannot happen. You know, read
[42:07] Thomas and the theory of scientific
[42:09] revolutions. answers come from outside
[42:12] the current paradigm. And that's what
[42:13] Bitcoin is is it's a bridge to that next
[42:16] paradigm. And you know, trying to solve
[42:19] those questions from within is like
[42:21] trying to push a a stalled car, trying
[42:24] to push a dead car from within, sitting
[42:26] in the passenger seat, pushing on the
[42:28] dashboard, trying to make the car move.
[42:31] You can't do it. You need a new car or
[42:34] you need to get out and push it. Um, and
[42:36] so that's what Bitcoin is, is it's a
[42:38] whole new whole new car. Um, so yeah,
[42:43] kind of a long-winded response, but I I
[42:44] don't know if if that gets back to to
[42:47] answer it was kind of a long way um to
[42:50] answer your question about status and um
[42:54] how do we get away from a money uh you
[42:57] know like point system like value system
[43:00] and it it's true our net worth measured
[43:03] in money GDP measured in money like you
[43:06] know like all these things are uh can
[43:08] you make can you get more money can I
[43:10] get or Bitcoin. Even Bitcoin, everybody
[43:12] thinks they don't have enough Bitcoin,
[43:13] you know, and it's like the trope, do
[43:15] you have enough Bitcoin? No, I don't
[43:16] have enough Bitcoin. Yes, you do. You
[43:18] know, like you've got enough money,
[43:20] you've got enough
[43:21] Bitcoin, you know, like hopefully you
[43:23] have enough health like and if you
[43:25] don't, the amount you need is is not
[43:28] like as much as you think to live
[43:31] abundantly. Um, and it's not easy, but
[43:34] um, we should be measuring our value in
[43:37] in the joy we bring to the world and uh,
[43:40] the love that we can accomplish and the
[43:43] happiness that we can create in
[43:44] ourselves and
[43:45] others. Yeah. It's this this mentality
[43:49] of, oh, I I want to get to 0.1 Bitcoin.
[43:53] I want to get to one Bitcoin. I want to
[43:54] get to 10 Bitcoin. I want to be a
[43:57] Satoshi billionaire. I want to be a
[43:59] Satoshi millionaire. All those concepts
[44:02] are very very popular
[44:05] actually in in in Bitcoin and and I
[44:08] don't know if it's healthy. Probably
[44:09] not. And look, I'm the same way. I I
[44:11] it's not like I'm above all of this.
[44:13] It's a constant battle. It's a constant
[44:15] fight against our upgra upbringing and
[44:19] the fact that we've been raised with
[44:21] this mentality of scarcity. But
[44:24] like you think about people like selling
[44:27] their chairs and I don't have enough
[44:29] Bitcoin and like are oh if you like buy
[44:32] a car if you buy a house then you're not
[44:35] a Bitcoin you know then you're doing it
[44:37] wrong and but you know what like life
[44:39] happens right now like I want to go out
[44:42] for a nice dinner. I want to like you
[44:44] know buy a Wagu steak. I want to like
[44:48] buy a nice motorcycle and race through
[44:50] the canyons. I I want to go on trips. I
[44:53] just went with my son to the Cayman
[44:55] Islands and I like held these giant
[44:58] stingray in my arms and like they're big
[45:00] and fluffy and kind of squishy on the
[45:02] side and they're flopping and you know
[45:04] like these experiences this world is
[45:07] like mindbogglingly bogglingly cool and
[45:11] like you should do the you should live
[45:12] your dreams right now and yeah. Okay.
[45:16] So, it's reasonable given the current
[45:20] structure of society and the current
[45:22] incentives. It's reasonable to try and
[45:24] get a certain amount of Bitcoin. It's
[45:26] reasonable to have goals and like it's
[45:28] kind of like far-fetched and outlandish
[45:31] to, you know, and it's easy for me to
[45:33] say cuz I'm a 50-year-old physician and
[45:35] I have money and blah blah blah. So, I
[45:37] get all those things and everybody's on
[45:38] a personal journey. So, I think if
[45:41] you're young and hungry and you're
[45:43] stacking Bitcoin,
[45:45] um you know, there's still balance to be
[45:47] had and you can still live abundantly
[45:50] while uh trying to achieve your goals
[45:53] and contribute um to, you know, to the
[45:56] zeitgeist and and to society. Uh but
[45:59] these things are, you know, it's a it's
[46:00] an individual journey for all of us. Uh
[46:03] but you're right, I'm not I don't think
[46:04] it's super healthy the way we're trying
[46:07] to accumulate Bitcoin. I mean, this was
[46:11] interesting. I I I borrow a lot of
[46:13] philosophy from other people, and Bitman
[46:15] uh Freud, who's a great follower follow
[46:18] on X, uh puts out these little uh
[46:21] armchair psychology posts, and he says
[46:24] like, you know, would you play Russian
[46:26] roulette uh with uh with like a a one
[46:29] in6 chance of dying for two Bitcoin? You
[46:32] know, what what about a two, you know,
[46:34] what about a um one-third chance for two
[46:37] Bitcoin? And like a surprising amount of
[46:40] people say yes, I would take that
[46:43] chance. And that is insane. So I talk a
[46:46] lot I talk a lot about that mentality
[46:48] and how we are
[46:51] um you know we're missing
[46:54] the it's like we've been giving the mo
[46:56] life. We've been given the most
[46:58] incredible gift in this life. And it's
[47:01] like we're missing
[47:03] the the the fact that it happens right
[47:06] now and that, you know, it's a total
[47:09] dream. You know, row, row, row your boat
[47:11] gently down the stream. Merrily,
[47:13] merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a
[47:15] dream. And uh, you know, I mean, like
[47:18] you can it's it's crazy what you can
[47:22] what you can do and accomplish and dream
[47:24] and be and experience and love. you
[47:27] know, love is like the most incredible
[47:30] thing. Um, and so, you know, we're the
[47:33] most wealthy of us are the people who
[47:36] are the most abundant and have the most
[47:38] love and uh um you know, I and have the
[47:42] most health, right? And it's not
[47:45] necessarily related to wealth. I think
[47:47] some base layer of wealth is important
[47:50] to accumulate because everyone is living
[47:53] in a scarcity mentality and everything
[47:55] is more and more expensive all the time.
[47:58] Um but I challenge everybody to you know
[48:00] become the best version of yourself and
[48:02] live abundantly. Uh I think it's
[48:06] um critical especially now with with AI
[48:09] coming. I I I truly believe we'll be
[48:11] living we'll be living to be 200 years
[48:13] old and 300 years old and 500 years old
[48:15] and even in our lifetimes that might
[48:17] become a reality. So, you know, why not
[48:21] live as if you're going to live forever
[48:24] and really take care of yourself and and
[48:27] focus on things other than um than
[48:29] money.
[48:31] That's a that's a really cool insight. I
[48:34] think that's that's really how did you
[48:38] how did you realize that like how did
[48:40] you uh realize that that or was it like
[48:43] a moment where you realize okay Bitcoin
[48:45] might bring us there because it's more
[48:47] than just an investment to make money uh
[48:49] and and we actually get there.
[48:52] Well, so Bitcoin was a little bit
[48:56] separate from the epiphany. I I think,
[48:59] you know, just having people die in my
[49:01] hands in the emergency department and
[49:03] having blood all over me and people shot
[49:05] through the throat and screaming and
[49:07] dying and, you know, and telling people
[49:10] they're going to die and watching people
[49:11] die and seeing how short life is. uh
[49:15] living in the immer, you know, living in
[49:16] being an ER doc and um dealing with um
[49:22] the hardcore reality of reality,
[49:26] whatever this reality is. Um you know,
[49:29] it's like a constant lesson. It's a
[49:31] constant in your face. And then I've
[49:33] always been a risk taker. So, you know,
[49:35] I've had a bunch of near-death
[49:36] experiences and um you know, stepping
[49:40] back and saying, "Oh, you know, holy
[49:42] crap, you know, that was almost the
[49:44] end." Uh re-evaluating, you know, and
[49:47] then trying to live life to the absolute
[49:49] fullest and meeting people who do that
[49:53] and have that ability and who are so
[49:55] genuine and authentic. uh and living
[49:58] living the dream, you know, like living
[50:01] as a you know, um that's been a lifelong
[50:04] mission and a lifelong
[50:07] uh choice and uh chance at
[50:10] self-discovery and and um something that
[50:13] I've worked on my entire life because
[50:15] and I think it takes constant practice.
[50:17] It's just like playing an instrument or
[50:20] um or or being good at anything, you
[50:23] know, like you want to be good at living
[50:25] life. You want to be good at uh at at
[50:30] perspective and you want to be good at
[50:32] being happy and you want to be good at
[50:34] taking things in stride when things go
[50:36] wrong and understanding that you're not
[50:38] going to have control over every
[50:39] situation. You want to be good at
[50:41] feeling abundant and um and loving uh at
[50:46] you know to the best of your abilities
[50:48] passionately. Um and so that's been a
[50:52] lifelong uh pursuit for me. Bitcoin just
[50:55] happened to be a puzzle piece that fit
[50:58] in naturally. Uh that opened my eyes and
[51:01] shook me and you know it was it was like
[51:04] literally like this and it was like um
[51:08] it was really during CO
[51:10] where everything was falling apart and
[51:12] and reality was coming unhinged and all
[51:16] businesses closed and I was like you
[51:18] know I I was flying on airplanes. I was
[51:20] the only person on these massive
[51:22] jetliners flying to my jobs cuz I would
[51:25] work in different places in the
[51:27] emergency department. Of course, I'm
[51:28] essential. seeing people, you know, die
[51:31] of COVID uh in the hallways of my
[51:34] emergency department and, you know, like
[51:38] the whole thing was like what the hell
[51:40] is going on, you know, and and um having
[51:44] a sense of like morbid fascination,
[51:48] uh you know, and and thinking about
[51:51] like, you know, like imagine like a
[51:52] meteor coming towards Earth and we had
[51:56] 20 days or something. Nobody would care
[51:59] about money anymore, right? Like who
[52:01] would care about Bitcoin? Who would care
[52:03] about like if you cared about that
[52:05] stuff, fine, but you'd be you'd be I
[52:07] think you'd be crazy. Like why? Like it
[52:10] seems like if you only had 20 days left
[52:12] and you and the big meteor was coming
[52:14] like like you'd be like, "Okay, what do
[52:16] I want to do?" Okay, I'm going to start
[52:17] smoking cigarettes or I don't know like
[52:20] for some people like because it doesn't
[52:22] matter and like or I'm going to like
[52:23] ride my motorcycle fast in the mountains
[52:25] or I'm going to love hard, you know, I'm
[52:27] going to do things that I'm going to
[52:30] whatever you wanted to do. Um like you
[52:32] would only have a small amount of time
[52:33] left. Well, the reality is we we don't
[52:36] have that much time to begin with. So, I
[52:38] think that like Bitcoin
[52:41] um uh kind of shook me because all of a
[52:45] sudden I saw that uh you know I started
[52:48] to really understand um inflation and
[52:52] money. I saw money printing. I saw what
[52:54] was happening. Um and it really clicked
[52:58] and I and I said, you know, holy holy
[53:01] cow. like um you know in this world that
[53:05] is very frail where we like keep this
[53:09] like semblance of everything's together
[53:11] and uh you know could all go away very
[53:14] quickly and so I think um Bitcoin was
[53:18] just like okay this is a solid
[53:20] foundation for um
[53:24] for for a wealth that can't be you know
[53:28] taken away or debased. Uh and then and
[53:31] then from that came ideas of you know
[53:34] when we debase our money system we
[53:36] debase our morality and we're more
[53:38] willing to like screw other people over
[53:41] for money or you know do shitcoins and
[53:44] and scam and grift and it's why people
[53:47] go to jail for fraud and why there's why
[53:50] tax evasion is massive and you know and
[53:53] and and all of a sudden with Bitcoin I
[53:56] saw um something that would make you
[53:58] know that could potentially make
[54:00] everybody um you know it's like this
[54:03] thing I call it a um a Trojan horse for
[54:06] morality because Bitcoin sucks you in
[54:09] because at its very like most
[54:13] primmaaccia level everybody sees Bitcoin
[54:15] and they're like okay if you can't beat
[54:17] them join them. I looked at this at
[54:19] 10,000. I looked at this at 30,000. It
[54:21] keeps going up. Crap. I better buy some
[54:23] because it's probably going to go to a
[54:25] million. I don't believe in it but I'll
[54:27] buy some. and it goes up to $300,000 a
[54:29] coin and you're like, "Holy crap, I need
[54:32] more." And then you start studying it
[54:33] and everybody knows what the hook is.
[54:36] And so, you know, and then all of a
[54:38] sudden you get really deep into it and
[54:40] you're like, "Wait a second. This values
[54:42] everybody's time equally and this values
[54:45] every this is like a static value and
[54:48] what one bitcoin equals one bitcoin and
[54:51] the reason it's going up in value is
[54:52] because like fiat money is actually
[54:54] crashing in value against it and you
[54:57] start to realize that it's like a more
[54:58] moral and just money system and that
[55:03] it's just so much better for humanity
[55:05] and so I think that like those things
[55:08] clicked like I had already been on a
[55:09] pursuit of wisdom and knowledge and
[55:12] abundant living abundantly and living
[55:15] life to its fullest and experiencing,
[55:17] you know, the the joy of life and trying
[55:20] to understand this crazy reality. Um,
[55:23] and then Bitcoin was like this large
[55:26] puzzle piece that just kind of slotted
[55:29] right in. And um, you know, Bitcoin in a
[55:32] way is a secular religion. And I I've
[55:34] never been religious. I I'm spiritual,
[55:36] but I don't have any beliefs um, as it
[55:39] were. And so Bitcoin kind of fit in as
[55:41] as like this uh really kind of uh way to
[55:47] achieve um a new kind of spiritual
[55:50] enlightenment that I think is um
[55:54] available to everyone and and can um
[55:58] bring everybody together uh instead of
[56:00] like this divisive world where everybody
[56:02] keeps becoming further and further apart
[56:05] and more marginalized and ostracized
[56:08] because of whatever belief system they
[56:10] have. And so that was my path. And um
[56:14] that's why Bitcoin fit perfectly into my
[56:17] worldview and why now I'm writing a book
[56:19] about it, why I'm doing podcasts, and
[56:21] why I'm trying to sp spread the word
[56:23] that not only can we live abundantly,
[56:26] but that Bitcoin is an accelerator for
[56:28] that and that we should try and focus
[56:31] inward, try and become
[56:33] self-actualized and do that through
[56:35] self-coitinization.
[56:38] It's so fascinating um because I never
[56:41] looked at a low time preference and
[56:44] living in the moment on on the surface
[56:48] it almost looks like there are two
[56:49] different concepts like low time
[56:51] preference means you value the the
[56:53] future more than than than present but
[56:57] then also you see all the Bitcoiners
[56:59] actually living really in the present
[57:01] and being in the now uh while having
[57:05] that low time preference and And and I
[57:07] think the past 1 hour that we now talk
[57:10] is I think one one big testament to to
[57:14] the combination between living the
[57:16] present but still being low time
[57:19] preference. So thinking 300 years
[57:22] ahead but putting that into the present
[57:24] moment which is a weird and almost
[57:27] impossible to explain that that thing.
[57:30] This gets really interesting. Um I think
[57:32] that the two although although although
[57:36] paradoxical um the two help to define
[57:39] each other. So living in the now and
[57:42] living for the moment and seizing the
[57:44] day is not mutually exclusive with
[57:48] having a low time preference. Um and and
[57:51] in fact there's a lot of famous wisdom
[57:53] that has been passed down through the
[57:55] ages about you know uh learn as though
[57:59] you're going to you know live forever
[58:01] but uh you know live as if you're going
[58:03] to die tomorrow. Uh you know and and
[58:06] there's a duality there uh in in the in
[58:10] kind of the the basic rules of of this
[58:14] reality. And the fact of the matter is
[58:16] is I think that you can't really have
[58:19] one without the other. Um having a low
[58:23] time preference or having living deeply
[58:27] in the right now are both predicated on
[58:30] self-love and a desire to make your your
[58:34] world a better place and the world at
[58:36] large a better place for for everyone.
[58:39] And I think Bitcoiners in general um
[58:42] have hope for the future and want, you
[58:46] know, desperately for for everybody to
[58:48] to have that realization that um we we
[58:53] can live abundantly and that we can all
[58:55] be wealthy together. And you know, I
[58:57] here's the beautiful thing. I think that
[59:00] um you know, becoming a hyperitcoinized
[59:03] society, even the people who never adopt
[59:05] Bitcoin, they will all benefit from it.
[59:08] everyone will benefit as Bitcoin is uh
[59:11] becomes the the standard um because I
[59:15] think it will raise the the the base
[59:18] layers of resource allocation to all of
[59:21] uh society. uh and so um you know when
[59:25] that happens uh more people can
[59:29] experience happiness and can experience
[59:31] ma you know Maslo's hierarchy of needs
[59:33] and can become self-actualized which is
[59:36] you know a journey of wisdom and and
[59:38] philosophy and authenticity and
[59:40] self-growth um and you know what's the
[59:43] ultimate utility of that and it's being
[59:47] happy in the present it's playing it's
[59:49] loving it's it's enjoying a great meal
[59:52] meal. It's It's not having to be glued
[59:55] to your phone all the time. It's, you
[59:57] know, uh kicking back and watching a
[59:59] sunset. It's being quiet with your
[60:02] thoughts. It's it's writing poetry. You
[60:04] know, uh helping others. It's giving
[60:08] back. Uh you know, those are very
[60:10] enjoyable things that happen in the
[60:13] right now, you know, or like like if I'm
[60:16] if I give I'm constantly
[60:19] giving money away, right? like um to to
[60:24] various all kinds of different things.
[60:27] Uh you know, I I invest, but uh a lot of
[60:30] charity. And um could I take that money
[60:34] and put it in Bitcoin and then have more
[60:38] money in the future to to to give away
[60:41] to more charities in the future? Yeah, I
[60:43] could do that. um you know, but the guy
[60:46] on the on the street or or you know, or
[60:50] someone who who needs help now or who
[60:54] that's going to help them enjoy their
[60:56] life now, you know, like I'd rather you
[60:59] know, things happen right now. So having
[61:01] a low time preference um is you know
[61:06] it's like a a spectrum and we need to be
[61:09] careful that we don't um make it a you
[61:13] can approach low time preference from an
[61:16] abundancy mentality or from a a scarcity
[61:20] mentality. And if it's approached from a
[61:22] scarcity mentality, then you're going to
[61:26] everything you do is going to be about
[61:28] pushing life to the future. And um
[61:32] you're you're going to be living a
[61:34] fiat life and a scarcity life. And
[61:38] that's not what it's about, you know,
[61:40] like like I I mean, you could do that
[61:42] and you you can say, you know, but
[61:44] when's it going to be enough? It'll
[61:46] never be enough. And you know, training
[61:49] to have a mentality of I can be happy
[61:52] now. I have abundance. I love myself. I
[61:55] I love the people I'm around. I I'm
[61:57] going to focus on relationships. I'm
[61:58] going to focus on having a crazy
[62:01] adventure and meeting people and going
[62:03] on adventures and traveling. Um, you
[62:06] know, that takes resources. It takes
[62:08] money. You need to spend money to get
[62:10] to, you know, wherever you're going to
[62:12] travel to or or to en enjoy your your
[62:15] life. So having a low time preference
[62:19] um with with an abundant abundancy
[62:21] mentality um I think just means that
[62:25] you're not wasteful and uh you know but
[62:28] at the same time you're you're living a
[62:30] balanced life where you're focused where
[62:33] you're focused on um achieving uh goals
[62:36] that that help you be wealthy in the
[62:39] now.
[62:40] So yeah, I mean
[62:43] um yeah, I I I encourage people to try
[62:46] and live in in the right now. You know,
[62:48] I I I invest my my time, my money uh in
[62:54] in uh efforts that help, you know, help
[62:58] people um both in the now and and for
[63:03] and to have and secure abundant futures.
[63:06] Do you think most of the Bitcoin
[63:08] community uh is is is living like that?
[63:11] Is do sometimes I feel like there's a
[63:14] lot of
[63:15] toxicity in in Bitcoin? There is a lot
[63:18] of toxicity and I think there's a lot of
[63:20] feeling of moral high ground. Um which I
[63:23] don't think exists. Uh you know
[63:25] everybody has their own path and
[63:27] everybody very much believes in in um in
[63:33] their in their set of ethics and their
[63:36] you know and everybody is
[63:38] very you know I mean it's it's hard
[63:42] because um I think having having all
[63:45] these uh different ideas about the way
[63:48] the world works is um you know if you
[63:51] let those ideas define you then you're
[63:54] going to you're going to defend them uh
[63:56] to the max. But instead, like if you're
[63:59] self-actualized and if you're healthy
[64:01] and you have, you know, a strong ego,
[64:04] then I think it's okay to have
[64:06] disagreement and have intellectual
[64:08] disagreement without offending each
[64:10] other, you know, like I happen to not
[64:12] have religious beliefs. I don't believe
[64:14] in a god or anything. Maybe there's a
[64:16] god. I don't know, you know, like, but
[64:19] um I I have certain thoughts about
[64:22] religion and and these sorts of things.
[64:25] And you know, I always appreciate people
[64:27] who philosophically can talk about that
[64:29] because there's always more we can
[64:31] learn. Uh but when I get into a
[64:33] conversation where you know you know
[64:36] like I had someone on X literally today
[64:41] we were talking about religion and
[64:43] somebody was like you I'm not going to
[64:44] name names but they were like I used to
[64:46] think the way you did 10 IQ points ago
[64:50] and 10 years ago and I was like why
[64:54] would you why would you offend me like
[64:57] let's I mean we could talk about this
[64:58] but or just say you don't want to engage
[65:01] with me or that you're upset that I'm
[65:02] challenging your ideas or you know but
[65:04] like what why why is it that uh we need
[65:07] that toxicity that that's also a
[65:09] scarcity mentality and um you know so uh
[65:15] yeah I think that um it it's I I would
[65:20] challenge people to become your true
[65:21] authentic self and to become
[65:23] self-actualized. I think that frees you
[65:26] from a lot of that um vitriol and
[65:29] bitterness and e and need for ego
[65:32] defense and need you know we're trying
[65:35] to become level up and we're trying to
[65:37] become stronger versions of oursel um
[65:40] more moral and uh kinder and and uh you
[65:45] know wiser versions of ourselves and uh
[65:48] it takes constant practice and so that's
[65:50] why I have that like daily action
[65:53] journal that sats journal journal that
[65:56] um that allows people to to track their
[65:59] uh you know their progress and and when
[66:02] I make a mistake or there's something
[66:03] that I do that I can learn from I think
[66:05] about I think about why did I do that
[66:07] you know why did it pop into my head to
[66:09] do that or why did I you know that's not
[66:11] like the perfect the most perfect
[66:13] version of myself that I see and so I
[66:15] write that in my sats journal uh and um
[66:19] I try and become a better person and so
[66:21] I I think that the Bitcoin community
[66:23] would do better to have more of that
[66:25] because we want to welcome people in. We
[66:27] don't want toxicity. And I think, you
[66:30] know, there's I I think people are like,
[66:31] "No, we want toxicity because Bitcoin is
[66:33] the only way." Like, Bitcoin is an
[66:35] organism and and it has an immune
[66:38] defense and it has it's going through an
[66:40] evolution. It's going through
[66:42] adaptations and it's going to succeed or
[66:44] fail. It's going to succeed, but it's
[66:47] going to succeed or fail on its own
[66:49] merits. No matter what you or I or any
[66:53] Bitcoiner says or wants or desires,
[66:55] Bitcoin does not give an F, you know,
[66:58] like it it just doesn't and it doesn't
[67:00] need any one of us. It's it's a it's
[67:03] it's a living, breathing digital
[67:06] organism uh that's alive and uh so it
[67:10] needs to be challenged. It needs Solana.
[67:13] It needs Ethereum. It needs final bosses
[67:16] who want to get rid of it. It needs
[67:19] forks and attacks and it needs quantum
[67:21] computing. It needs all of these
[67:23] challenges, you know, because otherwise
[67:25] it grows up in some kind of a nanny
[67:27] state and it's unrealistic
[67:30] uh for anything to undergo an evolution
[67:33] and not be properly challenged. I think
[67:36] we need like the most hardcore
[67:37] challenges for Bitcoin like uh to see if
[67:41] it survives. And so far it's survived
[67:43] and it's proved itself. And because of
[67:46] Lindy effect, I think we're, you know,
[67:48] kind of past the point of no return. But
[67:50] but who knows? Either way, the lessons
[67:52] it can help us uh to gain about
[67:55] abundancy and self-actualizing and and
[67:59] um low time preference. Those are
[68:01] philosophies and wisdoms that we can
[68:03] carry on even if Bitcoin were to fail.
[68:06] and then we can make the world a better
[68:08] place as individuals and as our
[68:11] authentic selves.
[68:14] It's it's very true. Um and just to your
[68:18] earlier point with uh on on Twitter, I I
[68:21] think a lot of people on Twitter are not
[68:26] truly themselves.
[68:28] uh you have that meme of two dogs uh on
[68:31] Twitter fighting each other and then
[68:33] there's like the fence going up and all
[68:34] of the sudden they're very nice to each
[68:36] other and I have found that in in my
[68:40] real life people are actually kind of
[68:42] nice. I uh for example just just
[68:45] yesterday I was in a supermarket uh and
[68:47] I had just like one item and the guy in
[68:50] front of me had like I don't know 30 and
[68:52] he's like oh like go in front. So small
[68:55] kindness is that like that I see
[68:58] kindness almost every day in in human
[69:01] beings especially if I go out in real
[69:02] life. If I go then on Twitter, it's a
[69:06] whole different world. And I think also
[69:08] the human brain works different on on on
[69:11] social media uh and uh if you go in
[69:16] actual like Bitcoin meetups, local
[69:18] meetups, like conferences, where you
[69:20] find other Bitcoiners, um
[69:24] you you meet a lot of more compassion
[69:27] and empathy than you meet on on social
[69:30] media. So there's like
[69:32] um a a a part of it maybe you are toxic
[69:36] but uh Twitter kind of amplifies your
[69:40] bad bad side of personality which it's
[69:43] not a good thing but I I I see it more
[69:46] on social media than in real life. Oh,
[69:49] well, I think that social media can
[69:51] therefore be one of the ultimate tools
[69:53] to look at ourselves and question
[69:55] ourselves and say, "Why did I say that,
[69:58] you know, or to apologize immediately?"
[70:00] I see people sometimes when I and I call
[70:03] people out immediately. I'll say I'll
[70:05] say things uh that show vulnerability
[70:07] like, "Hey, what you said really hurt my
[70:09] feelings." you know, instead of
[70:11] attacking them back and saying, you
[70:13] know, for this one,
[70:14] saying, you know, oh, like, you know,
[70:17] your IQ is 10 points, you know, higher.
[70:21] Well, you must still be in the range. I
[70:23] could have come up with some witty ad
[70:25] homonym attack, you know, to go back and
[70:28] forth. It's like the dog's barking. But
[70:30] instead, I lift up the fence
[70:32] immediately. And I said, why would you
[70:33] say that? You know, like that hurts my
[70:35] feelings. And um you know if you know
[70:40] this is a chance to grow and learn and
[70:42] then sometimes people have called me out
[70:44] because I'm not perfect. You know it's
[70:45] an ever um you know we're always trying
[70:48] to become our best selves and and live
[70:50] up to that idea of our of becoming our
[70:53] own superhero or Uber mench uh as as
[70:56] Nichi talked about. And you know, I
[70:59] think that for that reason, um, we can
[71:02] use social media as a tool to see how to
[71:06] to look I mean, we have evidence right
[71:08] there of what's coming out of our mouth.
[71:10] And is that the kind of person you you
[71:13] would like, you know, that you would
[71:15] like to get to know? Is that the kind of
[71:17] person you'd be proud of or proud of
[71:18] saying that's my friend? And if you
[71:21] can't answer yes to that, then you know
[71:24] it can be a tool for growth and you can
[71:26] just say okay and not only that we're
[71:29] being manipulated by algorithms and
[71:31] we're being hacked by AI. You know we're
[71:33] being controlled and and manipulated as
[71:36] we know um through these uh you know
[71:39] social um constructs and through these
[71:42] social platforms through these networks.
[71:45] Uh but you know you're right it it is um
[71:50] it is a different place and there's more
[71:52] social there's more compassion and
[71:54] empathy in real life uh when you can see
[71:57] someone's face and they're smiling and
[71:58] and you have a rapport and and uh you
[72:02] know it's easy to hide behind the
[72:03] anonymity of you know like like uh
[72:07] whatever uh um your persona is but you
[72:11] can
[72:12] really use it as a tool for
[72:15] self-improvement and it's uh um you know
[72:18] I I think it can be a very powerful way
[72:21] to have a mirror held up so you can see
[72:24] yourself better.
[72:26] Yeah. Sometimes we in in the moment and
[72:28] don't even realize that uh we are
[72:30] hurtful to another person. So uh that
[72:33] that that's a good thing. Um I have uh
[72:38] it's podcast went in a whole different
[72:40] direction that I didn't piss a bit but
[72:42] that's the beautiful thing of a
[72:43] conversation. Um I I have one more uh
[72:47] thing when you look at Bitcoin adoption.
[72:50] Um
[72:51] what do you fear the most that that
[72:54] Bitcoin could bring from the the the
[72:56] rise of of of Bitcoin? Is there anything
[72:58] that you're like um I I I fear that
[73:03] Bitcoin might bring that or I fear that
[73:05] Bitcoin might uh bring bring this bad
[73:08] thing out of maybe it's like increasing
[73:12] greed or something like that in in in
[73:14] society because Bitcoin itself is is is
[73:17] scarce and maybe the the scarcity
[73:20] mentality actually is increased or
[73:21] something like that.
[73:24] Well, f first thing is um there's a
[73:27] whole I have a whole chapter on fear in
[73:30] my book and what I would say is don't
[73:32] let your fear stand in the way of your
[73:34] dreams. Um and uh you know or or as
[73:38] Kennedy said, you know, that the only
[73:40] thing we have to fear is fear itself. Uh
[73:43] I don't fear anything about about
[73:45] Bitcoin. I I don't think that
[73:48] um you know that there's anything uh
[73:53] that that's going to come about that
[73:57] um isn't isn't already playing out in
[74:00] some sort of fiat world. uh you know
[74:03] like like I don't spend much time
[74:05] thinking about because I I think that um
[74:09] when you have some when you have value
[74:10] system based on uh code that's
[74:14] deflationary so that
[74:16] everybody's worth is going up over time
[74:18] and the value of their toil is going up
[74:21] over time then that makes people more
[74:25] moral and more just. So it's
[74:28] antithetical
[74:30] um to uh to fear basically because it's
[74:35] it's a hopebased system whereas the
[74:38] current system is a fear-based system.
[74:40] So having fear in general is a scarcity
[74:44] mentality. It is a fiat mindset. So I
[74:47] don't have any fear when it comes to
[74:50] um Bitcoin adoption or what's happening.
[74:54] But then the other thing is is like
[74:57] look, we're I'm 50 now. I just turned 50
[75:01] a few days ago. Like I'm going to be
[75:04] dead soon. Uh or AI will elongate my
[75:07] life to 500 to live to be 500 and then
[75:09] I'll be dead soon because 500 years is
[75:11] nothing. Um you know, like there's been
[75:14] thousands of generations of of people in
[75:18] my lineage behind me. And uh you know
[75:22] like I I just don't think that fear is a
[75:28] healthy construct
[75:30] uh or a healthy emotional response to
[75:34] um life. Uh like in general it prevents
[75:37] you from becoming the best version of
[75:39] yourself. It prevents you from going up
[75:41] to the hottest uh you know guy or gal in
[75:45] the room and starting to talk to them as
[75:48] a love interest or or you know sending a
[75:50] manuscript out to um you know a mentor
[75:55] or someone you know or or walking
[75:57] fearlessly up to anyone else and trying
[76:01] to learn from them, you know, like like
[76:03] we should be fearlessly
[76:05] uh courageous in the way we live life.
[76:08] And um so I don't have any fear
[76:12] specifically about the ramifications of
[76:16] of Bitcoin. Um that being said, I think
[76:20] all sorts of things are going to happen.
[76:22] And uh I think Bitcoin will make net on
[76:27] net crime go down, murder go
[76:29] down, it'll make intelligence it'll make
[76:32] wisdom go up. It'll make education go
[76:36] up. It'll make um you know equality go
[76:39] up. Uh it'll it'll make mental illness
[76:43] go down. It'll you you know I I just see
[76:46] it as a very net positive for the world
[76:49] and then ultimately uh leading perhaps
[76:53] to a postmoney society. Um which is
[76:57] where it gets really interesting because
[76:58] then we all start to lead our true
[77:02] potential and you know that's where the
[77:04] real interesting things happen. And I I
[77:06] think we're still in the dark ages when
[77:08] it comes to so much, you know, medicine
[77:11] and and um and money and and politics
[77:15] and and all of that. And so I think
[77:17] demonetizing the state will be um you
[77:21] know a groundbreaking moment for
[77:23] humanity. And that's why I think Bitcoin
[77:26] is the most important human invention uh
[77:29] since we discovered fire. uh you know
[77:32] it's like actually a way to uh and and
[77:37] it's not because it's a money system. I
[77:40] think it's a system for ending uh
[77:42] reliance on value based uh resource
[77:46] allocation systems. So I think Bitcoin
[77:49] at its at its heart and soul is
[77:53] um the bridge to uh a truly abundant
[77:57] future
[77:58] where you know money plays an attenuated
[78:01] role or no role at all. I mean how cool
[78:04] would it be if Bitcoin was worth
[78:06] nothing? I think that would be so cool
[78:10] and uh at the same time where there's no
[78:14] fear.
[78:16] So Oh yeah, of course. No, no, no, no. I
[78:18] mean that presupposes that um we it's
[78:22] like fiat to hyper bitcoinization to the
[78:26] next thing is we don't need money
[78:28] because
[78:30] because we can have anything that we
[78:33] want that that I I get that uh and it's
[78:37] it's really cool uh to to think about
[78:40] that uh a world where you can truly
[78:45] um go towards what's your highest uh
[78:48] excitement uh and and go towards where
[78:51] you actually uh feel you really want to
[78:54] want to go. I mean that that podcast
[78:56] came out of me pursuing my highest
[78:58] excitement leaving an IT job behind that
[79:02] I had for 6 years which was great like
[79:04] the environment was great the pay was
[79:06] great everything was cool um it was not
[79:09] something that pushed me out it was
[79:11] something I I wanted to have even more
[79:14] and that podcast was was really cool it
[79:17] didn't pay in in the beginning anything
[79:20] uh but I was like hey I I really want to
[79:22] try that I'm young I can take risks
[79:24] Uh, and I think that pursuit of of
[79:28] um the pursuit of the highest excitement
[79:31] uh is is is really really cool. And I
[79:34] would have done the podcast way sooner
[79:37] uh if if money wasn't even in there in
[79:40] the in the first place. That's that
[79:43] that's a great great thing to think
[79:45] about. What would you do? I I actually I
[79:49] asked that my uh my cousin like we have
[79:52] like a godson uh relationship and and
[79:55] for for Catholic church uh and and uh I
[80:00] he starts a new career now as a mechanic
[80:03] uh and I asked him oh like if uh you had
[80:08] not to make money like if if I just give
[80:10] you a million dollars every month what
[80:13] would you do and he was so um boggled by
[80:17] that question like you could really see
[80:19] how his concept kind of was was was
[80:22] thrown out of the window of like uh uh I
[80:25] I don't know video game like he he he
[80:27] didn't really even know how how to
[80:30] answer that that that question. Uh so uh
[80:34] I I I really do like th those topics
[80:37] where like
[80:38] okay take away money what would you do
[80:40] and and that's uh opens up a lot of
[80:43] possibilities for for people all of the
[80:45] sudden. It should be an easy easy
[80:48] question to answer and if it if it's not
[80:51] then you know that that's like some work
[80:53] that we it's that's a question we should
[80:55] all be asking uh very early on you know
[80:59] like how how would I want to contribute
[81:01] how would I feel fulfilled how you know
[81:03] what what would be my joy in life what
[81:06] would be you know um those sorts of
[81:08] things and you know you're incredible at
[81:10] podcasting um the way you listen the way
[81:12] you ask questions that bring out the
[81:14] best in your you know I love listening
[81:16] to your show and and recommend it and I
[81:19] don't catch every episode but you know
[81:21] you're one of the ones on my list and
[81:22] and so you're contributing by giving
[81:25] this platform by um you know helping
[81:28] share wisdom from so many different
[81:29] people uh because we each have like a
[81:31] different slice of uh you know if you
[81:34] imagine life is this big beautiful tree
[81:36] like or a big beautiful mountain let's
[81:38] say we're each standing on one side of
[81:41] the mountain looking at it and even if
[81:43] you're standing like you know a aisle
[81:45] that way. You have a totally different
[81:47] view of the mountain and what it looks
[81:48] like and the path up. Um, and so, you
[81:52] know, you're bringing together all these
[81:54] people and with all this wisdom and
[81:57] experience and knowledge, we can get a
[81:58] better sense of what the mountain looks
[82:00] like from every side. Uh, for people who
[82:02] are actually looking at the mountain,
[82:04] when you're stuck in a fiat job and
[82:06] you're not trying to be self-actualized
[82:08] and you're not working on um these
[82:10] things, maybe you're not even looking up
[82:12] at the the mountain. Maybe you're just
[82:14] focused uh hard on being, you know, a
[82:16] cog in the in in the machine, which most
[82:20] of us have been at some point and that's
[82:22] what the system selects for and uh and
[82:24] and rewards. So, um you know, it's a
[82:28] it's an honor to be able to sit down and
[82:31] have a conversation with with you, with
[82:33] Breedlove, with you know, all the with
[82:35] with everybody else. I'm uh talking with
[82:37] Brahm tomorrow uh for the Bitcoin
[82:40] Millennials podcast and you'll know be
[82:42] able to share my my book uh which which
[82:45] a lot of it is standing on the shoulders
[82:47] of giants. It's uh you know a lot of it
[82:49] is based is derivative um to the work
[82:53] that Sailor has done or Jeff Booth and
[82:56] just taking those ideas and uh and
[82:59] moving along with them and and so you
[83:02] know uh Jeff Booth likes to say um
[83:06] when you know when when money is uh when
[83:09] money is like overly abundant uh you
[83:13] know then then um uh oh I forget I
[83:17] forget the exact quote, but uh I
[83:19] actually have it. Uh I I'll just tell
[83:21] you. Uh but when um it's in it's in one
[83:26] of my chapters right here. And so and I
[83:28] have this open, so I might as well uh uh
[83:32] just tell you cuz it's it's worth it's
[83:34] worth it's worth stating it.
[83:37] um cuz cuz it's great and and this is
[83:40] partly, you know, what led me uh to
[83:44] write my book and and do the derivative
[83:47] work that that I've that I've done. Um
[83:52] is because of the thoughts of guys like
[83:54] Jeff Booth and and and Sailor. Uh so,
[84:00] okay, wait, here we go. Uh this this is
[84:03] worth the wait because it's a great
[84:04] quote and I and I have a quote at the
[84:07] beginning of each each chapter and so I
[84:11] just forget which chapter is
[84:13] um is Jeff's
[84:17] I funny enough I had Jeff on um yes
[84:22] yesterday actually had writing a new
[84:25] book right
[84:27] uh he's writing a new book
[84:30] I believe so that that's what uh he told
[84:32] me. Uh we we talk and he I want to hear
[84:38] um but here was his quote. He said,
[84:40] "Abundance in money creates scarcity in
[84:42] everything else and scarcity in money
[84:45] creates abundance in everything else."
[84:47] And so um that's a really powerful idea
[84:51] that you could write a whole book about,
[84:53] right? and that you could take as a
[84:57] starting point and go on all sorts of
[85:00] wisdom journeys and think about and say,
[85:02] "Okay, well, if that's true, uh, let's
[85:04] really think about it." And, uh, so, but
[85:07] sorry, you were saying he was on the
[85:08] podcast yesterday. Oh, I just wanted to,
[85:12] uh, mention because it's it's funny like
[85:14] he he was on like I recorded with him
[85:17] yesterday for people that now listen to
[85:20] the show. I've recorded since his
[85:22] podcast and your podcast. I think two or
[85:24] three episodes. So, you have to go down
[85:27] three episodes probably to to to find
[85:29] him. So, for the people that listen,
[85:31] it's probably like 3 days ago I recorded
[85:33] with with with Jeff Bof. Um, but it's
[85:36] it's funny like we we talk about him now
[85:38] and and I just recorded with him. That's
[85:39] why I thought about it. Well, he's
[85:42] living he's living in a Bitcoinized
[85:44] future already. And, you know, he's very
[85:46] fond of saying, "Oh, well, I I need to
[85:49] um uh you know, I you've got to live it.
[85:52] You've got to be fully immersed and
[85:54] fully do it. I actually differ with him
[85:56] there. Um because I think he's got so
[85:59] much wisdom and so much to share and add
[86:01] and he's got hundreds of thousands of
[86:03] followers on X and so like, you know, I
[86:07] I'll I'll write with him on on Noster,
[86:10] you know, and he's always over there.
[86:13] Um, but it seems like he's kind of
[86:16] engaging more in a a completely
[86:18] Bitcoinized life and world and living
[86:21] living, you know, uh, what he's saying.
[86:23] But, um, I see him as a leader, as a
[86:27] thought leader, as uh, you know, he's a
[86:29] hero. Uh, he's he's just had such
[86:32] incredible
[86:34] um, you know, groundbreaking ideas. And
[86:37] I I think that uh it it the value that
[86:42] he brings, it would be so important for
[86:44] him to get out to the the masses and
[86:47] share his ideas with the masses and and
[86:50] some of that for me means, you know, it
[86:52] would be I I would love to see him
[86:54] really act and sometimes he goes on to
[86:56] Twitter to be on spaces and I think he
[86:58] intuitits this. Um but uh you know I
[87:01] think he he has a real gift for
[87:04] explaining some of these fundamental
[87:06] ideas to people. Um but uh and so we
[87:11] differ in some philosophical places. But
[87:13] I love that because, you know, that's uh
[87:17] because he's also very um he's he's very
[87:21] uh you cenial and and and wise and open
[87:24] to discussing um you know uh
[87:28] counterarguments and counterpoints. So
[87:30] he he's a truly great guy.
[87:33] He he absolutely is. And uh he yesterday
[87:37] was actually almost emotional for me
[87:38] because he was not only the the first
[87:41] bigger guest for me uh that I had on
[87:43] Jeff was coming on my show when I had uh
[87:47] let's say around like 800 monthly uh uh
[87:51] listeners. So like it was already
[87:53] starting but it was like very small uh
[87:56] 800 uh compared to now depending on the
[87:59] month 50,000 to 100,000 monthly uh
[88:02] listeners. Uh so uh first I really
[88:07] really love that he goes on small
[88:10] podcast. I've seen it with so many small
[88:12] podcast. He just comes on true uh and
[88:15] and and that's something um not a lot of
[88:19] people uh with his following with his um
[88:22] standing in the community do that. um
[88:25] the more and more than that, but he is
[88:29] uh he's he's probably one of the best
[88:32] five thought leaders for me at least uh
[88:34] in in Bitcoin and he just goes to all
[88:37] the podcast uh and that's that's great
[88:40] and he inspired me actually uh to to
[88:43] take that step to to the podcast because
[88:45] he told about his story of he has all
[88:48] his financial energy in Bitcoin but his
[88:50] time is still in fear and and he woke up
[88:54] one day and like he he told that story
[88:56] on my first episode with him uh and and
[88:58] it was so uh inspirational for me and
[89:01] after that I I remember that very
[89:03] vividly. I after the podcast with him on
[89:06] the first one where I still had my FIA
[89:08] job. I stood up. It was like 4 in
[89:10] afternoon I took a long one hour walk
[89:13] and after the walk I was like I I have
[89:16] to do that like
[89:18] that I I I have to do that. Like that's
[89:22] the thing I really want to do. That's
[89:23] the thing. It makes
[89:25] sense. And and and that was just like
[89:27] one pivotal moment uh for for me. And so
[89:32] like Jeff Jeff is really I really admire
[89:35] him like he is I think a role model in
[89:37] many senses. But enough Jeff Bloof.
[89:42] [Applause]
[89:43] Uh I have I have one question that I ask
[89:46] each and every one of my guests and the
[89:48] question is and I'm really curious what
[89:50] you say to that. What can we learn from
[89:52] you besides Bitcoin? M well I think if
[89:57] anything it's uh um how to have a
[90:00] complete and total joy for life and love
[90:03] for uh people and love for this great
[90:07] gift and the time that we have here. Um
[90:10] because Bitcoin doesn't automatically
[90:12] give you that. You can have tons of
[90:14] Bitcoin and still be very unhappy. But
[90:16] um I think that if I can share my
[90:20] experience from uh you know life and
[90:24] death in the ER and the crazy things
[90:26] that I've seen and if I could share um
[90:28] that joy of living that I that I have
[90:32] and like the excitement and the
[90:33] happiness and and the fun uh that I have
[90:37] uh with life. Uh, I think that um people
[90:41] have told me that it's infectious and
[90:43] you know that's why I did Ninja
[90:45] Warrior and uh why I ran around on TV in
[90:48] a gold suit and you know like uh and you
[90:53] know it's I want to live life to the
[90:55] absolute fullest and I think that um
[90:58] outside of Bitcoin learning how to do
[91:00] that and learning how to be fearless and
[91:03] and living your best life uh if I could
[91:07] uh teach anything or if I wanted to
[91:09] learn something uh from a younger age
[91:11] and pursue something. It would just be
[91:13] to be more fearless uh in in having fun
[91:17] um and uh and taking risks. You know, uh
[91:21] the ship wasn't meant to stay in the
[91:23] harbor, right? It wasn't meant to stay
[91:25] on the dock. It was meant to um be out
[91:27] on the open sea and and challenge the
[91:30] storms.
[91:32] So, uh, if anything is outside of
[91:35] Bitcoin that I could, um, you know, help
[91:38] people with and and it's much like you
[91:42] felt that you needed to do the podcast.
[91:45] Uh, you know, I have felt that way
[91:46] about, uh, many things over my life. And
[91:50] I think that
[91:52] um you know there it's it's scary for
[91:56] people uh to to take risks and to take
[91:59] challenges and um it's not the easy path
[92:03] but I think that it's
[92:06] uh it's it's really important for
[92:09] personal growth and um so hopefully that
[92:13] that people can see that and and learn
[92:15] that from from me and see the way I'm
[92:17] living life and and
[92:20] uh you know certainly I've learned that
[92:21] from others and I hope I can pass that
[92:24] knowledge down not only to my son but to
[92:26] anyone who else who will listen uh and
[92:29] who wants to live a happy and fulfilling
[92:32] um contributo
[92:35] life and this is so great uh because I
[92:39] think even if you go about the the risky
[92:42] path and um the the the path that you
[92:47] would do if money wouldn't be an issue
[92:50] even if you fail on that path uh you
[92:53] come out the other way uh a uh as a
[92:57] better human being I think with with
[92:59] more experience and with a better story
[93:00] and with with something um exciting and
[93:04] and and and b if you don't do it you you
[93:07] will ask whole your life like why didn't
[93:10] I do it and I think that's the biggest
[93:12] thing it starts with loving yourself you
[93:15] know and like that's why I wrote self
[93:17] bitcoination you know it at its heart,
[93:19] it's about loving yourself and uh
[93:22] developing that relationship with
[93:24] yourself and growing uh yourself in a
[93:27] way where you're feeding that love
[93:30] because that's going to that's going to
[93:32] filter out to all your other
[93:34] relationships and all your other
[93:35] endeavors. Um and it'll be a guiding
[93:39] light uh in everything that you do. And
[93:42] so, you know, loving yourself
[93:44] is probably one of the most important
[93:47] things in life and that's the beginning
[93:48] for health, for wealth, for for
[93:51] everything.
[93:53] Absolutely. Um, we have an end routine
[93:56] in the podcast where the previous guest
[93:57] is asking a question uh for the next
[94:00] guest without knowing who the next guest
[94:02] actually is. And the previous guest asks
[94:04] you the question, where do you get your
[94:06] information to be a better Bitcoiner?
[94:09] Yeah. I mean, so I get it from uh Robin
[94:14] Ser's podcasts. I get it from uh
[94:17] Breedlo's podcast. I mean, I I'm very I
[94:20] have a lot of time to listen to
[94:22] podcasts. So, I love podcasts. I get on
[94:24] spaces. Uh I try and keep a very open
[94:27] mind and listen to everyone's opinions
[94:30] um and get some sort of consensus around
[94:33] things. Um, Sailor is just a
[94:37] mindblowing juggernaut of of um, you
[94:42] know, ideas and conceptual
[94:44] understandings about Bitcoin. Uh, so I I
[94:47] try and absorb everything Sailor,
[94:49] everything, Jeff Booth, you know, a lot
[94:50] of the standard stuff. But, uh, also my
[94:53] friend Larry Leard just wrote an
[94:55] incredible book called The Big Print and
[94:58] he wrote the forward for my book. Um and
[95:01] so like I was honored uh and his book is
[95:04] incredible and so like I consume that
[95:07] sort of uh that sort of uh information
[95:11] so that I can become more knowledgeable
[95:13] and then I give that on to other people
[95:15] and have discussions about it. But you
[95:17] know I would say that podcast the
[95:19] Bitcoin Edge with Paula Iverson she's
[95:22] also a very small podcast uh that is
[95:24] growing and she's she's great. Um, and
[95:28] then, uh, you know, obviously What is
[95:31] Money podcast is is great. I listen to,
[95:35] uh, um, a lot of other big podcasts that
[95:38] are are non Bitcoin. Um, and I think
[95:41] that it's like important to leave the
[95:43] the echo chamber and to get on spaces
[95:46] and get on in in um, you know, I do a
[95:49] lot of spaces with physicians and
[95:51] doctors and and I try and I try and get
[95:53] a feel for, you know, what are other
[95:56] people talking about uh, when it comes
[95:58] to technology and and the 99% of people
[96:01] who haven't adopted Bitcoin, for whom
[96:04] Bitcoin isn't everything and who don't
[96:06] understand yet. what are
[96:08] the what are the obstacles that they're
[96:11] facing to understand that? Um why is it
[96:14] like something that they might still
[96:16] roll their eyes at? Uh and so uh you
[96:20] know it's mostly podcasts and and and
[96:22] books uh and then it's just really
[96:25] really smart people uh who've been alive
[96:27] for a long time and are willing to share
[96:29] their time and their knowledge uh with
[96:32] me. And I really want to talk to, you
[96:34] know, no coiners quite a bit and
[96:36] understand why they're not seeing it.
[96:39] Um, and instead of trying to orange pill
[96:42] them, I'm trying instead to get a better
[96:46] philosophical understanding of what I'm
[96:49] missing and uh, you know, what it's like
[96:53] to um, not have any conception of what
[96:57] Bitcoin is. And I think that's a useful
[96:59] exercise uh for Bitcoiners because
[97:01] that's most people most people don't
[97:03] understand, especially doctors, you
[97:05] know, I'm an ER physician and most
[97:07] doctors I have to be very careful about
[97:09] how I talk about Bitcoin. I don't talk
[97:11] about it at work. I don't talk I can't I
[97:13] can't bring it up because all of a
[97:15] sudden like I'll lose credibility as
[97:17] like uh you know because people have uh
[97:20] re they're really set in their ways. So,
[97:23] um, I want to learn more about why that
[97:25] is or why they're so close-minded to it.
[97:28] Um, so, so those are the resources I
[97:31] use. That's a great question. Um, and
[97:34] there's a lot of great wisdom out there
[97:36] if you're open to to learning and if
[97:39] you're always a student. I I I love that
[97:42] because it almost feels like my whole
[97:45] life is a podcast. For example, today I
[97:48] was guest on a podcast. I recorded two
[97:51] podcasts for my own podcast. Uh and
[97:54] while I was eating lunch, I watched a
[97:57] podcast from someone else. So, uh
[98:00] podcasting got a lot of energy. Yeah,
[98:03] podcasting is is basically my all all my
[98:07] life now. And it's it's something I'm
[98:10] deeply in love with actually. And for
[98:12] learning, I always have this um fear of
[98:17] I have I listen to podcasts and if
[98:19] there's like a guest or a person that is
[98:21] really interesting, they usually have
[98:23] written a book uh and I found if I I
[98:26] find them really interesting, I then
[98:28] purchased the audio book uh and and and
[98:31] dive really deeper on there because you
[98:34] can dive quite deep in like a one to
[98:36] three hour
[98:37] conversation, but there's a lot of
[98:42] uh not noise but like the signal of a 8h
[98:47] hour audio book on that same topic is
[98:50] higher than if you have the same guy on
[98:54] talking about that with in a podcast
[98:56] conversation
[98:58] uh that is like I don't know one or like
[99:00] we are approaching two hours now uh 2
[99:03] hours long so uh I I like to browse
[99:08] actually minds with podcast like oh I
[99:11] want to listen to him. Oh, I want to
[99:12] listen to him. What does he has to say
[99:15] about that? And just listen to him for
[99:16] like one, two hours. Uh, and sometimes
[99:18] they come out and like, oh, that's not
[99:20] that interesting. Or sometimes I'm like,
[99:21] "Oh, that's super interesting." And then
[99:22] there's like a week where I only consume
[99:24] this guy um and dive deeper and then
[99:29] next week there's something else. But
[99:31] podcast is such a fascinating medium.
[99:35] Uh, and I I have said that multiple
[99:38] times and and people ask me like, "Oh,
[99:40] like how long will you keep up the
[99:41] podcast?" I'm like, I I don't I don't
[99:44] know if I ever stop it. Like it it's so
[99:48] good to have focused conversation every
[99:51] day. Maybe I step back and don't do it
[99:54] every day anymore and then maybe like
[99:56] two times a week or I don't know. But uh
[99:59] I I cannot imagine not doing a podcast.
[100:02] That's really cool. Yeah, that's that's
[100:04] cool to get your uh your insights and
[100:07] perspective as a podcaster. Um that's
[100:09] really neat and uh hopefully uh we can
[100:12] have another conversation in the future
[100:14] because this has been a great one. AB uh
[100:16] absolutely we we will uh do a second
[100:18] round. Uh I'm I'm thinking more and more
[100:20] like how to reinvite guests but um
[100:23] because if I it's a complicated topic
[100:26] but I I definitely want to reinvite you
[100:28] because yeah we talked almost two hours
[100:31] and I have a lot of other topics I
[100:34] actually wanted to to get to. Um thank
[100:36] you so much Noah for for being on before
[100:38] let you go where can people find you ask
[100:40] you questions reach out to you see the
[100:42] book? Yeah, absolutely. Well, the book

[100:53] quite yet, but hopefully in the next
