[00:00] Actually, if you're a true Bitcoiner,
[00:02] you should spend your Bitcoin
[00:03] ultimately. Yes, you should maximize
[00:05] your stack. But I think by focusing
[00:06] solely on, okay, don't spend as much as
[00:09] you earn. That's enough. But you should
[00:11] also be in a position where you should
[00:13] actually reinvest this Bitcoin into your
[00:16] time while you're here. Basically
[00:17] transitioned my skills, what I did in
[00:19] the music industry into the Bitcoin
[00:22] industries. The one thing which is so
[00:24] exciting about Bitcoin is that we're
[00:25] building this parallel system or
[00:27] parallel economy which needs all the
[00:29] skills that the normal fiat industries
[00:32] or the normal economies have. Kind of
[00:34] from a filmmakaker's perspective, it's
[00:36] really a dream, but you have to sell
[00:38] your soul because you need to create all
[00:40] of those videos promoting the new
[00:42] airdrop of Shitcoin X, but they have so
[00:45] much money. It's actually ridiculous. If
[00:47] you consume with the intention to create
[00:50] something yourself, like that's the
[00:51] right thing to do.
[00:54] [Music]
[00:57] To give people a little bit of a
[00:58] background who you are, maybe uh give us
[01:00] some overview of what you're doing and
[01:02] what is in Bitcoin that excites you
[01:04] most.
[01:06] Yeah. So, uh my name is Max. I'm
[01:08] basically a filmmaker and I um yeah,
[01:12] I've been I've
[01:14] been I started my Bitcoin journey
[01:17] actually in the music industry. So, I
[01:19] I've been working in the music industry,
[01:21] uh, creating brands and artists there.
[01:23] And then at some point, I stumbled upon,
[01:25] uh, this weird thing, Bitcoin, which
[01:27] since then I can't, uh, get enough of,
[01:30] and basically transitioned my skills,
[01:34] what I did in the music industry into
[01:36] the Bitcoin um, industry. So, why do I
[01:40] say this? Because this is also the thing
[01:42] that excites me most about Bitcoin. So I
[01:46] want to tie this into my personal
[01:47] journey because the one thing which is
[01:49] so exciting about Bitcoin is that we're
[01:51] building this parallel system or par
[01:54] parallel economy which needs all the
[01:56] skills that the normal fiat industries
[01:59] or the normal economies have. And I was
[02:02] basically at the point when I um when I
[02:05] found Bitcoin, I was a uh as I said in
[02:08] the music industry, I had no idea how
[02:10] this skill set which I had could
[02:12] translate to the Bitcoin uh industry. So
[02:16] I basically just tried to to yeah adapt
[02:20] this and build now a business. I'm uh I
[02:23] co-ounder 21C studios and we are behind
[02:26] a lot of uh Bitcoin brands. So we help
[02:29] them making videos, documentaries, we uh
[02:32] edit a bunch of podcasts. So it's
[02:36] definitely a thing which I want to tell
[02:38] anybody who's listening there that like
[02:40] the the one thing is we all need new
[02:43] Bitcoiners and Bitcoin needs new skills.
[02:46] So yeah, that's very shortly who I am
[02:48] and um what I think is the most
[02:50] important thing about Bitcoin. Yeah, I
[02:52] think we need uh it's it's such a great
[02:54] point because I think we need a lot more
[02:56] Bitcoiners and a lot more people that
[02:58] create content uh write write more
[03:01] books, more articles, make more
[03:03] podcasts, make more Tik Toks, like like
[03:06] movies, documentaries, like there's so
[03:07] many different forms of of content these
[03:09] days, but like from all of them, we need
[03:12] like 20x more. Exactly. And that's also
[03:15] the cool thing because like Bitcoin
[03:17] touches every single aspect of your
[03:19] life, which I which I kind of hinted at
[03:22] before, but like it doesn't necessarily
[03:24] mean that if you are like a new Bitcoin
[03:27] podcaster, that you you won't talk about
[03:30] the same thing, but there will be a
[03:31] niche. Uh, for example, somebody's going
[03:33] to talk about business and Bitcoin and
[03:35] another person's going to talk about
[03:37] health in Bitcoin. And I think that's
[03:38] just a natural progression. And because
[03:41] Bitcoin is still this one thing and this
[03:44] this one topic, a lot of people probably
[03:46] are like, "Oh, there are enough Bitcoin
[03:47] podcasts, there are enough um enough
[03:50] Bitcoin filmmakers." But if you if you
[03:52] reframe that and just see it as
[03:54] something which touches every aspect of
[03:56] your life instead of just being this one
[03:59] topic, you can actually just choose
[04:00] another topic in the intersection
[04:02] together with Bitcoin and there you have
[04:04] a niche where you can build your own
[04:06] brand. You can create something if this
[04:08] is something you want to do.
[04:10] Yeah, that's that's probably one rule
[04:11] that I I broke because I have like
[04:14] literally everyone in the Bitcoin
[04:16] industry like I've now like you're my
[04:19] 418th guest. So like the I I didn't
[04:23] really pick a niche in Bitcoin which has
[04:25] some there are some problems with that.
[04:27] Uh like especially with organi event
[04:29] organizers they always like oh like what
[04:30] do you want to talk about? I'm like I
[04:32] don't know
[04:33] like I always talk about Bitcoin and
[04:36] everything that is kind of related to
[04:37] that and even like parenting and diet
[04:40] and all those things that kind of
[04:41] Bitcoin is also like to talk about. But
[04:44] that's that's really interesting and and
[04:45] I think we need that um like social
[04:47] proof and the social revolution of of
[04:50] Bitcoin more and more. I think it's it's
[04:52] really important that people stand up
[04:53] and and talk about Bitcoin uh so we
[04:56] don't uh lose to the altcoin shitcoin
[04:59] show that they are doing.
[05:01] Exactly. And it's it's also this thing
[05:03] right now like as you said like it's
[05:06] it's almost
[05:07] like I I don't want to frame it as a
[05:10] fight against the altcoins but but
[05:11] apparently they you know they they have
[05:13] a lot of VC money. They have a lot of
[05:15] marketing thing and Bitcoin doesn't have
[05:17] that. Bitcoin basically just has the
[05:19] people who believe in it and I think
[05:21] therefore like everybody has this unique
[05:24] perspective on Bitcoin because because
[05:27] it is so diverse and so uh yeah like you
[05:31] you can talk about Bitcoin in so so many
[05:34] different angles. So I really think
[05:36] because we have this now also with
[05:39] lobbying, you know what happened just
[05:40] with Trump on Sunday when he announced
[05:42] the strategic shitcoin uh reserve, it's
[05:45] just like um everybody can to a certain
[05:48] degree help push the Bitcoin message.
[05:51] And if it's, you know, posting a meme,
[05:53] posting some tweets, or even just doing
[05:55] a podcast which is only about Bitcoin,
[05:57] you know, like you did already
[05:59] 48 episodes or whatever it was, and
[06:02] there is an audience for everything with
[06:04] Bitcoin. And if we think about that
[06:06] bitcoin will only grow also bitcoiners
[06:09] will grow and therefore um I think it's
[06:12] a great yeah great po point in history
[06:15] where there are so many opportunities
[06:16] but you just have to take one of them
[06:18] and actually commit to it and have the
[06:20] discipline to yeah keep pushing forward
[06:23] and so that's why I would say like if
[06:25] you're a bit coiner start doing content
[06:27] we need you absolutely
[06:31] um you touch on a really interesting
[06:33] point of of
[06:36] um because Bitcoiners tend to get um
[06:40] wealthier over time as it's the most
[06:42] sound money and it's it's it's the best
[06:44] form of storing your financial energy.
[06:46] Uh and you also get this minimal
[06:49] approach of like DCAing of of like don't
[06:52] spend more than than you make and like
[06:54] you're incentivized to do all those uh
[06:56] great financial things. Um if we spin
[07:00] that like 50 years in the future, it
[07:02] will be a world where those people who
[07:05] actually did the the Bitcoin way, the
[07:07] the Bitcoin DCA, the Bitcoin storing of
[07:11] uh storing financial things, um those
[07:13] will be be the people with all the
[07:15] resources that um can influence
[07:18] politics, that can influence all the
[07:19] other things. Uh probably like
[07:21] politicians will be bitcoiners because
[07:23] they they will be the ones that that can
[07:26] fund themselves. How how different is
[07:28] that the game theory of what what we are
[07:30] currently playing that uh in the end we
[07:34] will win with that but like in the
[07:35] middle part it's it's it's hard because
[07:37] it's like a decentralized movements and
[07:38] we don't have a CEO or marketing team
[07:40] and stuff like that. Yeah, I I think
[07:42] this is exactly the point which makes us
[07:45] stronger to a certain degree because you
[07:47] need to hold to your values uh with a
[07:51] lot of integrity and not sell yourself
[07:53] out and there like bitcoin history has
[07:55] shown bunch of people who were not able
[07:58] to do that and I think as you said
[08:00] because bitcoin gives people this uh
[08:03] wealth and uh ultimately the power with
[08:06] this power there comes a lot of
[08:08] responsibility and I think because it
[08:12] goes that way which you just said that
[08:14] it's it's apparently very hard to do
[08:15] that right now. I think this is just you
[08:19] could almost say it's a filter for the
[08:21] people who are who who are earning then
[08:25] in the future to get this responsibility
[08:28] because everybody who wants to trade
[08:31] shitcoins because you know you can make
[08:32] a million dollars as a content creator
[08:35] probably if you shield some shitcoin and
[08:36] so on but I think it's this um shorttime
[08:41] preference thinking which ultimately in
[08:43] the long run will destroy you because
[08:45] first of all yeah like you you would
[08:48] would need to abandoning all of your
[08:50] morals and your values, but also as you
[08:53] said, I think the long-term game of
[08:56] having or building this Bitcoiners
[08:59] network is invaluable. It's almost like
[09:01] being at Silicon Valley in the early
[09:04] days and uh then knowing all of the
[09:08] people in there, the podcasters, even
[09:11] just the plebs is like still so small.
[09:13] If you go to like several Bitcoin
[09:15] conferences, you will always meet the
[09:17] same people. And I do think because the
[09:20] people who tend to stay in the space for
[09:23] that long have the right values in the
[09:26] future they will be represented in those
[09:28] uh yeah in those jobs or positions which
[09:31] have a lot of responsibility and
[09:33] therefore I think it will pay off later
[09:36] massively whereas now it might seem like
[09:38] the harder way. It's a low time
[09:40] preference uh way of life. Do do you
[09:43] have insights of um like do you're doing
[09:46] documentaries, movies, like podcast
[09:48] settings and all the all those things
[09:50] for Bitcoiners. Do you also have
[09:51] insights in in the altcoin world with
[09:54] with with the same exact thing? And can
[09:56] you com compare those things like uh you
[09:58] said in the beginning with VC money and
[10:00] and stuff like that? Yeah. So me
[10:02] personally, I don't really have
[10:04] experience because I don't really want
[10:06] to work with those guys. But I I have
[10:09] some friends in the film making um space
[10:12] which started working for like shitcoin
[10:15] exchanges and it's insane how much money
[10:18] they pay. It's like it's kind of from a
[10:20] filmmaker's perspective, it's really a
[10:22] dream, but you have to sell your soul
[10:25] because you need to create all of those
[10:26] videos. um yeah promoting the new
[10:30] airdrop of Shitcoin X and um but they
[10:34] have so much money it's actually
[10:37] ridiculous. And so this is kind of the
[10:39] thing where I've been I've been
[10:43] experimenting a lot with value for value
[10:45] the last couple years where I was like
[10:47] uh trying to yeah test if the Bitcoin
[10:51] the Bitcoin people are actually sending
[10:53] you money if you do high high quality
[10:55] content and it worked to a certain
[10:57] degree. But I was I was really
[11:00] questioning what I just told you before
[11:02] you asked this question which was that
[11:04] it will count in the long term. And just
[11:07] now the last uh couple months now I see
[11:10] how it's actually paying off because
[11:12] it's been like for me creating content
[11:15] has been very hard like not profitable
[11:17] at all but I did it now for I think 3
[11:19] years and only now with um staying in
[11:24] this space it's actually now the need is
[11:26] there for people to have those high
[11:28] quality uh edits and now it's like I I
[11:33] would say those those years is building
[11:36] a how do I best say that? Uh it's not
[11:39] monetary value, but it's it's like a
[11:42] people value. That's not the right way
[11:44] to say it, but it's like the the people
[11:46] network is so much more work worth now
[11:50] that any money which which I would have
[11:53] been able to acquire by working for [ __ ]
[11:56] cuts because now you know people are
[11:58] working on bigger projects. they are
[12:00] actually connected to my values and I
[12:03] see that like now I can spread my
[12:05] message in a way that I would want to.
[12:07] Um but having said that yes [ __ ] coiners
[12:10] pay a [ __ ] ton of money and it's like
[12:13] you have to be very strong to to not um
[12:17] start working with those. Yeah. It also
[12:20] makes you kind of question like where
[12:21] does the money comes from? And uh
[12:23] obviously we know a lot of people lose a
[12:25] lot of uh money playing in the shitcoin
[12:28] world and in the end in the end of the
[12:30] day someone has to pay for for those
[12:32] things and it's usually uh the the end
[12:36] user that uses the this air tokens those
[12:39] those tokens that fly around uh and and
[12:41] and plays those kind of uh crypto games
[12:45] I would call it uh and and and in the in
[12:49] the long run I think um the the truth
[12:51] will will not I'm also really
[12:54] interesting of like um you tried value
[12:56] for value I I never really tried value
[12:58] for value I I do have some very small
[13:01] part in value for value but I don't
[13:03] promote it so it's it's small uh with
[13:06] you being long in there what have you
[13:08] seen of like monetizing content I mean
[13:11] it also depends on like what kind of
[13:12] content uh you have but you probably
[13:16] tried like sponsorships partnerships
[13:18] value for value and all those kind of
[13:20] things Yeah. So, value for value works
[13:23] to a certain degree, but it only works
[13:25] when it's really high quality content.
[13:27] So, I created the Nostra documentary,
[13:29] which was like the first documentary
[13:31] about uh Nostra, which is a protocol um
[13:35] on which you can't be uh censored. And
[13:39] so there I would say it worked pretty
[13:41] good just because I put a lot of effort
[13:44] in there and was like this whole thing
[13:45] where a lot of people actually knew how
[13:47] long it took me and saw like the process
[13:49] of me doing it. Um whereas other videos
[13:53] really don't work at all even though I
[13:57] put a lot of work in. So it's it's it's
[13:58] like I didn't yet figure out what the
[14:00] thing is that makes value for value
[14:02] work. Um because and that's kind of like
[14:07] where I'm now thinking the value for
[14:09] value approach is not on the monetary
[14:10] side but it's rather on the other side
[14:13] on the network side because like for the
[14:17] for those three years a lot of people
[14:19] knew me and kind of knew that okay I'm
[14:23] doing this with with value I don't do
[14:25] any anything else and that helped me to
[14:28] get to know people which I wouldn't have
[14:30] been able to know because it was like oh
[14:33] you have to work together with this guy,
[14:34] he's doing this, let me introduce you to
[14:36] this guy. And so even though um I I
[14:40] can't really answer the question what
[14:42] works with value for value where I would
[14:45] tend to say yes it works with very high
[14:47] quality videos which people actually
[14:50] care is um yeah it's it's kind of like
[14:55] yeah I I would repeat what I said but
[14:57] one thing which I wanted to add here as
[14:59] well is that as a content creator value
[15:02] for value is it it seems shitty but it's
[15:05] actually a very um very honest feedback
[15:08] mechanism because clicks and likes and
[15:11] all of that. This is cheap like it
[15:14] doesn't have any cost for the viewer to
[15:16] actually do this. Yes, you might argue
[15:18] that the attention uh that you have to
[15:21] put onto watching it. Um but then this
[15:25] this aspect of actually sending somebody
[15:28] money, this is where the true value
[15:30] lies. And by being on those three years
[15:34] of creating content via value for value,
[15:37] I think that this helped me to become a
[15:41] better uh filmmaker or content creator
[15:44] because I was seeing what the people
[15:45] actually care about. And this led me
[15:48] then down the path of uh I've been like
[15:51] all over the place doing Bitcoin
[15:52] content, no content, health content. And
[15:55] somehow for me, for example, the health
[15:56] content really worked good and people
[15:58] liked it and zapped it and sent me some
[16:02] uh Bitcoin. And then I figured out, oh
[16:04] yeah, I actually enjoy doing this a lot
[16:06] and now I'm actually focusing even more
[16:09] on on that angle of of Bitcoin. So it's
[16:14] kind of this feedback mechanism which
[16:15] can be very very valuable of your skills
[16:20] of the network you will acquire but it
[16:22] might lack in the value of the monetary
[16:25] representation of the work you put in.
[16:28] Yeah, there's this like hierarchy of of
[16:31] feedback. Uh the the the cheapest ones
[16:34] are obviously like likes or anything
[16:36] that goes with one click. Um uh and then
[16:41] I I guess the the second level or the
[16:43] the the second highest level would be
[16:45] the the average through duration, the
[16:48] actual time that people spent on
[16:50] something like a like on a tweet that
[16:53] didn't cost anything. Like it's
[16:54] literally a second that they spend on a
[16:56] tweet. But if they invested, let's say,
[16:59] one and a half hours on a podcast, like
[17:01] that's kind of a feedback of like, oh,
[17:03] he stickked around for one and a half
[17:05] hours. uh there's some kind of time
[17:07] investment in uh and then the next thing
[17:10] would be yeah like they they did not
[17:11] only watch it uh they also like gave
[17:14] money because if they gave money they
[17:16] probably have watched it so like the
[17:19] first level kind of requires the the
[17:21] second one uh so there there's like the
[17:23] this like it's it's it's fascinating
[17:26] because I personally don't say like oh
[17:28] like give me value for value or anything
[17:30] like that I don't advertise it but still
[17:32] I get uh value for value here and there
[17:34] um I think I think it's almost every
[17:36] week actually from from somewhere. Uh
[17:39] even if you don't count fountain because
[17:42] with fountain I think it's almost every
[17:43] day now. Uh where there's some boost or
[17:46] something like that coming. Uh but I'm
[17:48] amazed of how generous people are and
[17:50] saying like hey I found value in that
[17:52] free podcast that I don't have to give
[17:55] anything but I like to give to give more
[17:58] uh because I found value in that. I'm
[18:00] I'm amazed by that kind of mindset. Uh,
[18:03] is do you think that's a Bitcoin thing
[18:04] or overall just a human value for value?
[18:08] Is that new movement coming up? I mean I
[18:10] mean you could argue that value for
[18:11] value was always there in if you go to
[18:14] any street in a major city you have some
[18:16] artists or musicians playing there and
[18:18] that's kind of the same thing um where a
[18:21] musician just stands there and hopes
[18:22] that you give him money and ideally if
[18:25] he's very good the value he gets back of
[18:28] course is higher as well. And I think
[18:30] value for value is just the uh and by
[18:33] the way this was how before concerts and
[18:36] so on happening like in the middle ages
[18:38] how how the music industry worked. Um
[18:41] cuz the that they were just playing like
[18:43] this or had like even theaters and it
[18:46] was free for you to watch and then you
[18:48] were able to donate whatever you thought
[18:50] it's worth. So I don't think that it's a
[18:52] new thing. I think um it's just the
[18:55] adaptation of that into the internet and
[18:59] like the cyerspace and this is then
[19:03] combined with the understanding of
[19:07] bitcoiners that the what is actually
[19:10] valuable and also valuing this value and
[19:13] then being generous enough to give it
[19:15] back. So I don't think that in another
[19:18] space people would be as um genuine not
[19:22] genuine as how do you say free to give
[19:25] something. It's just because people have
[19:27] I people who are into Bitcoin I think
[19:30] have a very special perception of value
[19:32] and what it means to get there because
[19:34] they're so connected with proof of work.
[19:37] they understand it and the combination
[19:39] of those two actually make value for
[19:42] value kind of work but also it's still
[19:45] so early so I I hope that like in 5 to
[19:48] 10 years it's going to be working even
[19:49] better because then it's just uh normal
[19:51] to play to to do that but um yeah
[19:57] I never looked at um that value for
[20:00] value is kind of what the before the
[20:03] digital age just standing on the street
[20:05] and performing with a ties. Uh that
[20:08] that's what you're kind of doing. You
[20:09] you're performing on on digital streets
[20:12] and uh you're hoping that someone puts a
[20:15] euro in your um in your basket, but now
[20:18] it's not a digital digital now it's not
[20:21] a like a physical cash euro. Now it's
[20:23] like a Satoshi that that people can put
[20:25] in your basket. Um which is a fun thing.
[20:28] Yeah. The interesting thing about this
[20:30] is that basic value for value lives
[20:33] mostly about the in incre ins
[20:35] discrepancy or like the difference of
[20:37] people's net worth. So even with being
[20:40] on this on the street uh people there
[20:43] they might be walking a millionaire bar
[20:45] or something and give you $50, you know,
[20:47] and that's a lot for you. The normal
[20:49] people might send you two cents, 10
[20:51] cents or whatever. But now it's it's
[20:53] kind of like in the physical space this
[20:55] is super limited because
[20:58] um because you only see the people who
[21:01] are actually walking by. But on the
[21:03] internet this is finally scalable. And
[21:05] this is why I'm so like bullish for
[21:08] maybe in five to 10 years um if like
[21:11] more people own Bitcoin, more more um
[21:14] platforms or protocols actually enable
[21:17] it because for me for example, Michael
[21:19] Sailor once sent me um Bitcoin because
[21:23] of one of my videos, you know, and of
[21:25] course for for Michael Sailor sending
[21:27] Bitcoin is on a complete different level
[21:29] than for a normal pleb. And therefore
[21:31] this one video then was suddenly
[21:33] profitable just because one person
[21:35] enjoyed it. That's amazing. What what
[21:37] did he uh what was the video about? It
[21:40] was uh the silent Bitcoin revolution of
[21:43] Africa. It was basically me traveling uh
[21:46] South Africa. It's already like 3 years
[21:48] ago or something. Uh it was one of my
[21:51] first documentaries I ever worked on and
[21:53] it was basically just explaining how
[21:55] African people um are using Bitcoin and
[22:00] what use cases yeah they are catering um
[22:04] there. Interesting. What is actually
[22:05] your favorite project that you did so
[22:07] far? I saw like that the ethical you
[22:09] mentioned nostr you mentioned I think as
[22:10] Salvador you also did one. What is kind
[22:13] of like something that that stands out
[22:15] for you? Yeah, for for me definitely one
[22:18] of my latest ones uh the my Muay Thai um
[22:22] documentary was basically me because it
[22:25] was just not only the editing work which
[22:28] the other one was but it was actually
[22:30] just me being out of my comfort zone and
[22:32] getting [ __ ] for 6 months because I I
[22:36] basically started uh from zero
[22:39] knowledge. I've never been a fighter,
[22:40] never had any fighting or boxing lessons
[22:43] to getting into the ring of a
[22:45] professional muight and fighting a Thai.
[22:48] And so it was kind of like just this was
[22:51] like the the most proof of work I've
[22:53] done in any project I've ever or like in
[22:56] my life because it just took so long to
[22:58] actually build up the skill. Then also
[23:00] edit the video that it's good and then
[23:03] um yeah, post it. But uh that's that
[23:06] that's definitely the one which I'm most
[23:08] proud of. I love that. It's recently I
[23:12] had Renato Moano and uh Kenny Florian
[23:15] also on my podcast and the will maybe
[23:18] one two more UFC fighters actually be on
[23:20] my channel. Um I'm I'm fascinated
[23:23] by intersection of fighting and and and
[23:26] Bitcoin. How how was the I unfortunately
[23:29] did not see the video but how was how
[23:31] how was the experience like six months
[23:34] you're trying to to fight and and then
[23:36] uh after the six months you had like one
[23:38] big fight so you trained for 6 months
[23:40] and you you you had one fight. Yeah, it
[23:43] was it was very hard. Very very hard.
[23:46] And it's like it's so humbling to do
[23:49] that because um yeah, it's like you you
[23:52] can't cheat in fighting. There's no
[23:54] cheating there. Like in in a lot of
[23:56] things in life, you can cheat your way
[23:58] through. You can kind of wing it, but
[24:00] not in fighting because it's so
[24:03] undeniably raw that if you like if you
[24:06] have your like even just your arms down
[24:09] for one second, it could be over. So,
[24:11] it's really this primal it like this
[24:15] primal way of yeah almost like I
[24:18] wouldn't even call it a sport because
[24:20] one of the one of one pro Muay Thai
[24:22] fighter I was training with was like
[24:24] always saying you can't play Muay Thai
[24:27] or fighting because you you play
[24:30] football, you play tennis and you play
[24:32] all of that stuff but there's nothing
[24:35] which is playful about fighting because
[24:37] it's very very dangerous. So they only
[24:40] like you can only fight Muay Thai, you
[24:42] can't play Muai. And so the 6 months for
[24:45] me kind of were this realization going
[24:48] through this and going through a lot of
[24:50] pain which I never experienced before.
[24:52] Uh but I think also doing this was
[24:55] extremely valuable for like my my life.
[24:58] I don't think that I'm going to fight
[24:59] again because I had all of the learnings
[25:02] which I had in the first fight. But um
[25:05] if I would have never fought yet, I
[25:07] would urge everybody to do it once
[25:10] because it's it's something which you
[25:12] you can't really tell anybody because
[25:16] the two weeks before the fight. So I've
[25:18] been training for five five months, five
[25:20] and a half months and then the two weeks
[25:23] before like I knew the fight was
[25:25] scheduled and there was no going back.
[25:27] And then suddenly you face this it's
[25:31] literally it's a a fear of death because
[25:34] you don't know what's going to happen
[25:35] there. So the professional Muay Thai
[25:37] fights are only with gloves but no
[25:39] paddings nothing. Um, and you can kick,
[25:41] you can give somebody an elbow. And then
[25:45] the two weeks before that, I was kind of
[25:46] realizing, oh [ __ ] what if something
[25:48] happens? You know, that happens a lot
[25:50] that people break their noses, people
[25:52] even dying in there because they break
[25:54] their necks or something. And so
[25:57] confronting this fear of death willingly
[26:02] changes you because you um you need to
[26:05] you think suddenly so differently about
[26:08] life. So for me for one one moment for
[26:11] me was I was walking through I I was in
[26:14] Thailand. So I was walking through
[26:15] Thailand and it was only yeah a couple
[26:19] of days before my fight and everybody
[26:21] was so happy and everybody was like
[26:23] having fun here and there all the
[26:24] tourists and I had this realization that
[26:26] like dude nobody here they're all living
[26:29] such a good life but they don't know how
[26:32] dangerous life could be. And um I was
[26:36] like, "Oh shit." Like um what when
[26:38] something happens and it was just like
[26:41] all those people are kind of like living
[26:43] their life but have no idea what I'm
[26:46] about to do and I have no idea what
[26:48] they're about to do. And so from there
[26:51] at some point a couple days before the
[26:54] fight happened I kind of had this
[26:56] acceptance of death that like even if I
[26:59] die in there I it was my decision. I
[27:02] went this journey and this was very
[27:05] powerful because then it kind of
[27:06] switched and you just accept it and
[27:08] you're very calm. It's like you don't
[27:09] have any fear, nothing. And also when I
[27:13] then got into the ring, it was it was a
[27:15] weird feeling because I was super
[27:17] prepared. I was super dialed in. I was
[27:21] very nervous but not really afraid of
[27:24] death. And that's something which I
[27:27] don't think you can understand unless
[27:31] you went through something like that.
[27:36] Interesting. It did you call your family
[27:42] before the fight or is like if you if
[27:44] you have that realization like I could
[27:47] die in there. Is there something like oh
[27:49] like maybe I should make a round and
[27:51] call my like my five loved ones? I
[27:55] didn't call them because I didn't want
[27:56] them to be worried, but I I had I I
[27:59] wrote something down for just in case.
[28:02] Yeah. Interesting. Yeah, that was that
[28:04] was that has to be such an interesting
[28:08] experience of like, hey, because I might
[28:12] die tomorrow, I will write a letter down
[28:15] and and and write down like what's most
[28:17] important for me to to to give other
[28:19] people. I think just going through that
[28:22] experience alone is probably worth it.
[28:23] Right. Exactly. And it's also like after
[28:26] this your values also change radically
[28:30] whereas like um things which you thought
[28:33] are important for you might look very
[28:37] different after you realize this like oh
[28:39] what if I would die tomorrow like what
[28:42] is actually the thing that truly matters
[28:45] and this kind of happened and um I think
[28:50] that's why also a lot of people say this
[28:52] like fighting it spiritually is because
[28:54] of that reason. It's not necessarily
[28:57] just the 15 minutes in in the cage or in
[29:02] the ring, but it's especially the
[29:05] preparation as well as this short period
[29:09] before the fight. Um because it's also I
[29:12] also had Kenny Floren on my podcast and
[29:15] he also said like um you're getting used
[29:18] to the fear but it never really goes
[29:20] away. It's just like how do you actually
[29:23] um you just learn how to cope with the
[29:26] fear but it never goes away. So
[29:30] um yeah I I forgot where I wanted to go
[29:34] with this but ah yeah with the with the
[29:35] writing down exactly and that's why like
[29:38] the whole thing of actually fighting um
[29:41] we could also go why the the fight
[29:43] itself is spiritual but I would say even
[29:46] this period before the preparation will
[29:48] change your life massively because it
[29:50] just puts um puts everything into
[29:53] perspective which I think is very
[29:54] important because like as I said the
[29:57] people in Thailand When I was walking
[29:58] there, I was just like, dude, like life
[30:01] in on this earth is actually not always
[30:06] happy, happy, ch happy, you know, like
[30:08] if you look in the at the history of
[30:10] mankind, there were always a war, there
[30:12] were always death, diseases and so on.
[30:14] And we're now having this perception
[30:16] that okay, maybe not even now in the
[30:19] next last two years. But I I think a lot
[30:22] of people forget that nature is kind of
[30:26] brutal, which is just part of it. It's
[30:28] not don't say it's good or bad. It's
[30:30] just part of what nature is. And this
[30:32] kind of just gives gives you such a such
[30:35] a deep insight into this brutality. And
[30:38] I think that's one of the most valuable
[30:40] things to be connected to that
[30:43] brutality. And yeah, I learned a lot
[30:45] from it. It's also like the you probably
[30:48] got a for for there's this thing like
[30:52] time is way more valuable than even
[30:54] Bitcoin. So like that's the that's the
[30:56] only thing also way more scarce than
[30:58] than Bitcoin. Uh and and you probably
[31:01] also got a lot of calmness in in in that
[31:03] of like okay I I I can lose Bitcoin. I
[31:06] can use bend Bitcoin because the the
[31:08] most valuable thing is actually the time
[31:10] and not having a huge stack of Bitcoin.
[31:13] And that's also like a thing which I'm
[31:17] I'm thinking a lot of because a lot of
[31:19] Bitcoiners are like, "Oh, don't spend
[31:20] your Bitcoin. Don't spend your Bitcoin."
[31:22] But I'm also thinking like actually if
[31:24] you're a true Bitcoiner, you should
[31:26] spend your Bitcoin because it's
[31:28] ultimately yes, you should maximize your
[31:30] stack. But I think by doing by focusing
[31:33] solely on okay, don't spend as much as
[31:36] you earn, that's enough. But you should
[31:38] also be in a position where you should
[31:40] actually reinvest this Bitcoin into your
[31:43] time while you're here. And what do I
[31:46] mean by that? like you should probably
[31:47] invest um your your stack into building
[31:51] a family, having um experiences which
[31:54] you can't exchange, but just sitting on
[31:57] your stack not using it for anything is
[32:00] in my opinion also not the smartest way
[32:04] of do or like of handling Bitcoin. Um
[32:09] because yeah ultimately life is here I
[32:12] think to learn and have experiences and
[32:14] those will then propel you on the next
[32:16] level or wherever you want to go and it
[32:19] it ties also back to what we said before
[32:21] with like getting responsibility when
[32:24] once Bitcoin is there if you're just
[32:26] sitting on your stack not doing anything
[32:28] not spending it to meet other people not
[32:30] spending it to to to go risk full on
[32:34] risk on something else I think it's
[32:37] harder for you to have enough
[32:39] experiences to land at the end of
[32:41] Bitcoin hyper um bit hyper
[32:43] bitcoinization where you're in a
[32:45] position where you learned enough during
[32:47] that period of time where you can
[32:48] actually take responsibility for your
[32:49] lives but also for others lives. Yeah,
[32:52] this is um a really good point of of
[32:55] like Bitcoin is money and money should
[32:59] be used like it's it's a tool. Exactly.
[33:03] Yeah. And like you know I understand the
[33:06] people who say like don't spend your
[33:07] bitcoin d but I don't agree with them
[33:10] and I say like the c caveat here is like
[33:13] you shouldn't spend more bitcoin than
[33:15] you make in a month like your bitcoin or
[33:17] sats balance should always be positive
[33:20] and it's enough it's if it's one sat or
[33:22] 10 sats as long as your monthly balance
[33:25] goes up in satoshi's term don't don't
[33:28] look at the dollar term but just look at
[33:30] the satoshi's then you're living onwards
[33:34] towards the right direction and the
[33:37] that's ultimately the only thing you
[33:39] need to focus on. Let's take a break for
[33:41] a moment and appreciate the beauty that
[33:44] coin vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[33:47] watches. Those watches are the most
[33:49] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[33:52] that you are a true Bitcoiner. and Coin
[33:56] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[33:58] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[34:02] watch collections. You have the date of
[34:04] the first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[34:07] there and of course also the block
[34:09] height and which epoch we are currently
[34:13] in. I love the level of detail they put
[34:16] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[34:18] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[34:21] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[34:24] love those watches. so so much. And now
[34:27] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[34:29] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[34:31] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[34:33] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[34:35] first way is you put it on a hardware
[34:38] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[34:41] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[34:44] BitBox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[34:47] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[34:50] if you check out the link in the
[34:51] description, you even get 5% off if you
[34:54] use the code Robin. And the second way
[34:57] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[35:00] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[35:03] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[35:06] They will personalize for you a
[35:08] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[35:11] your individual situation. They will
[35:14] show you how you can secure your own
[35:16] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[35:19] enough. You also have to keep all your
[35:21] devices secure. One topic that is
[35:23] overlooked often is the inheritance
[35:25] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[35:28] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[35:31] a plan for that in place already? And
[35:33] last but not least, if you're in a
[35:35] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[35:38] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[35:40] that, head over to the
[35:44] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30 minute
[35:47] free call. And just a quick side note, I
[35:50] will be for the first time ever speaking
[35:52] at the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[35:55] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[35:58] really looking forward to seeing all of
[36:00] you there. You can get your ticket in
[36:02] the link down in the description of
[36:04] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[36:06] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[36:10] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[36:12] there. But even even beyond that, I
[36:14] think um like I have lived my whole life
[36:17] like that. Like I since since I'm uh 21
[36:22] years old, so like the last like four or
[36:24] five years, I've been always stacking
[36:26] Bitcoin. Like each month I had more
[36:27] Satoshi than the than the previous month
[36:30] with with one two small exceptions where
[36:32] I lost Bitcoin because of small
[36:33] mistakes. But let's not go into that too
[36:35] deep. Uh but uh outside of those
[36:38] exceptions, um but I think if there's
[36:43] really something valuable, it's okay to
[36:44] even spend Bitcoin savings that you
[36:48] already have of like, okay, maybe uh I
[36:51] don't know, I want to take I've I've
[36:53] accumulated a big stack over the last
[36:56] five years. maybe I want to take one
[36:58] year off with my family or like I think
[37:00] I think there's a responsible way of of
[37:03] of using your Bitcoin uh to giving you
[37:08] more time and life back and I think
[37:10] that's really valuable even though I do
[37:12] agree a lot with like if if your Satoshi
[37:16] balance goes up every month you're doing
[37:18] doing something right and I think
[37:19] there's accumulate accumulation phases
[37:22] and and and maybe um later down the line
[37:26] uh you spend them more. But I think
[37:28] especially if you realize like it
[37:31] could even if you don't fight tomorrow,
[37:34] your end your life could still end
[37:36] tomorrow. And then you're like, "Okay,
[37:38] maybe I can still use that stag." Um
[37:41] it's something that I'm thinking of. Um
[37:43] currently I don't even have something I
[37:45] want to spend my Bitcoin on. It's not
[37:47] even a debate that I have. Uh but uh I
[37:50] actually taken um let's say because of
[37:54] one thing I also kind of uh yeah I'm
[38:00] thinking a lot about is like this
[38:01] bitcoin once you have this wealth or
[38:03] bitcoin just goes up I there is this
[38:06] tendency of people as you say to not
[38:09] work anymore or like to actually just
[38:12] chill because they have accumulated
[38:14] enough and I think there's also a little
[38:17] bit of a problem with that and I'm
[38:19] interested about your take on that
[38:21] because my my perspective is this like
[38:26] uh that I see you should provide value
[38:29] to other people and to society to to
[38:32] like build this future we all want to
[38:34] live in because as Bitcoiners or me at
[38:37] least as a Bitcoiner I want to live in
[38:38] this more prosperous more efficient or
[38:42] better future to a certain degree and my
[38:45] way of helping to get there is to create
[38:48] value for other people and the the way
[38:51] to um the ultimate metric to see if this
[38:56] happens or not is my income or the money
[38:59] that comes in. So my my question here is
[39:03] what do you think about that? Because do
[39:05] you see the problem that when Bitcoin
[39:08] makes you too wealthy or like you you're
[39:10] actually accumulating too much that you
[39:12] then stop creating that value for other
[39:14] people?
[39:15] I actually um think everyone that I
[39:19] don't know like if there's like a
[39:20] Bitcoin OG now listening and he has like
[39:24] 100 Bitcoin and he probably is like
[39:26] making the calculation is like okay I
[39:28] can probably retire now um especially if
[39:31] Bitcoin grows over time. I think
[39:35] um you should not do it but you should
[39:39] do it and I explained by what I mean by
[39:41] that. um you should retire that to get
[39:45] it out of the system. There are so many
[39:48] um examples of successful entrepreneurs
[39:50] that were successful one time they got a
[39:54] bunch of money and then they're like
[39:55] okay now I can retire and they tried
[39:57] this life for one year and they got
[39:59] depressed they got sad they because all
[40:03] of the sudden there was nothing like
[40:05] being retired and don't doing anything
[40:08] it sucks after a while. uh and I I
[40:11] cannot I cannot speak about that but I
[40:14] because I never tried it but this is
[40:16] what I I hear all the time uh of of
[40:19] people they they they can they cannot
[40:22] stop they they want to do something so I
[40:25] think if if there's someone now that
[40:28] thinks of like okay should I retire on
[40:30] Bitcoin um yeah if you can afford it
[40:34] like go ahead and do it get it out of
[40:36] your system I promise most of them after
[40:39] 6 months, 1 year, 5 years, whatever the
[40:42] time frame is, they will find something
[40:46] uh where like, oh, like that's really
[40:48] interesting. And all of a sudden, like,
[40:49] hey, maybe the he can help. And all of a
[40:52] sudden, they're building the sec the
[40:53] next startup. They're building a new
[40:55] project or they creating something. And
[40:57] and that's really the the the
[40:59] empowerment that that Bitcoin kind of
[41:01] gives. I was kind of doing that uh last
[41:06] year actually almost exactly one year
[41:09] ago. Last year in March I I I left my
[41:11] fear job and uh I had a YouTube channel
[41:15] with around 400 subscribers and you know
[41:18] how much this pays like almost nothing
[41:21] like literally nothing. And I I but I
[41:23] really wanted to do this podcast thing.
[41:25] Uh and I had a and I was like okay I
[41:28] will try it with 20 more Bitcoin and
[41:30] then and see where it goes. Um, I didn't
[41:32] had any securities. Um, my only income
[41:35] stream that I had back then, I don't
[41:36] have right now. So, I had to really fast
[41:39] search for something new. Um, but I
[41:42] really wanted to do it and I could do it
[41:44] because I had my Bitcoin stack. So, I
[41:46] was prepared to live off my Bitcoin to
[41:49] fulfill my dream with working in
[41:52] Bitcoin. Um, and luckily I never had to
[41:56] sell a single Satoshi of my savings uh,
[41:59] ever, but I wouldn't had made the jump
[42:02] without my Bitcoin stack. So that that's
[42:06] my two ways of thinking of that. Like if
[42:07] you really want to retire and lay on the
[42:09] beach, like go ahead, get it out of your
[42:11] system. I promise you, you will be back
[42:12] sooner than you think.
[42:15] Uh and the the second thing uh the that
[42:17] that I think it it can provide financial
[42:22] um safety to actually do what you really
[42:26] like. If there's someone that I don't
[42:29] know is like 40 years old and he worked
[42:31] uh all his life now and he made a nice
[42:34] stack but he really doesn't like his job
[42:37] maybe it's a good time to um try
[42:39] something new out uh and retire of your
[42:43] fear job but find something where you
[42:45] can actually contribute to society. So
[42:47] like retiring doesn't mean be laying on
[42:50] the beach retiring can also mean like
[42:52] doing what you really like. Like my
[42:54] grandpa is still every day in in his
[42:56] garage and making wooden things like
[42:58] they are so
[43:00] amazing. All of our family has those
[43:02] things. So, but he doesn't take money
[43:04] for that. Like he's retired. He but he
[43:07] pursues something and he who he could
[43:08] sell it on Holland store for a lot of
[43:10] money, I guess. But uh so I don't know.
[43:13] That's my two frameworks how I think of
[43:15] retiring. I think retiring on a beach is
[43:18] is boring. And if you want to do it, do
[43:20] it. But I don't think anyone really
[43:22] wants to do it for a long time. Yeah.
[43:25] And and what you just uh pointed out
[43:28] there, I think this is kind of how we
[43:30] then are able to create this better
[43:32] society because by saving on like real
[43:35] money at some point you can focus on the
[43:37] things that you actually really care
[43:39] about and this then will give you also
[43:42] another purpose to actually achieve what
[43:44] you want to do. So I think it was the
[43:46] Wright brothers who um they had a biking
[43:49] bike shop um which they were yeah
[43:53] repairing bikes and so but they had this
[43:54] passion of actually um wanting to learn
[43:57] how to fly and because they had like the
[44:00] savings which are stored in gold back
[44:02] then they were able at some point to
[44:04] also make the jump to actually not focus
[44:06] as much on actually repairing bikes
[44:08] anymore but focusing on like trying to
[44:12] see if they can figure out how to build
[44:14] a plane.
[44:15] And I think that that's for example
[44:18] similar to what you said happened to me
[44:20] as well. I wasn't a filmmaker a couple
[44:22] years ago. Bitcoin actually gave me the
[44:25] possibility to become a filmmaker in the
[44:28] sense that before that I was in the
[44:30] music industry. I didn't know that I
[44:31] want to do movies or either that I can
[44:34] do it. I and by getting into the Bitcoin
[44:38] industries or like industry getting to
[44:41] know people but then also making this
[44:43] jump of being like ah okay I don't want
[44:45] to have a fear future I want to do
[44:47] something within Bitcoin then I was able
[44:50] to uh as you said like actually go find
[44:54] my passion and then make something out
[44:56] of it and sometimes it takes this leap
[44:58] of faith like saying okay I'm okay to to
[45:02] pay um 10% of my stack for the next year
[45:05] or something. But uh yeah, I think you
[45:09] nailed it down there because I like not
[45:12] working. I think it makes you miserable.
[45:14] And Bitcoiners shouldn't aim to hold
[45:17] Bitcoin to retire. Bitcoiners should aim
[45:20] to use Bitcoin to actually free
[45:22] themselves from the fiat mines to work
[45:25] on what they truly care about. Yeah,
[45:27] it's like the retiring on Bitcoin and
[45:30] this whole topic of retiring uh within
[45:33] Bitcoin is super popular. Uh and I think
[45:36] most people don't want to not do
[45:39] nothing. Uh they they want to do
[45:41] something they really like. Um I'm also
[45:44] curious. You said like you did the six
[45:46] months of my time. Are you always
[45:48] working like you're doing half a year or
[45:51] a year like one project and nothing else
[45:53] in between? Did you when you train for
[45:55] for that fight, did you still work on
[45:57] other projects? Uh or how do you do
[46:00] that? Yeah, I I mostly have different
[46:02] projects running simultaneously. So,
[46:05] right now mainly focus on um my my own
[46:09] podcast which I'm doing as well as
[46:11] really focusing on the agency on 21c
[46:14] studios. Um so right now I don't have um
[46:18] that many documentaries which I'm
[46:20] producing but when I was doing the Muay
[46:22] Thai video I actually while training I
[46:26] was filming the whole 6 months but I
[46:27] also released every 3 weeks
[46:31] approximately I would say another
[46:32] documentary which I just made in in the
[46:36] time frames between which yeah is is
[46:39] very hectic but uh if you want to do
[46:43] make YouTube work It's It's harder than
[46:46] you think.
[46:48] Yeah, I can I can I can agree to
[46:51] that. But it's that's really impressive
[46:54] of like within 3 weeks the the
[46:57] documentaries um because like I have the
[47:01] podcast and it's it is great and and you
[47:04] probably know it from from yours. It's
[47:05] it's so much more straightforward the
[47:07] process like once I got my processes
[47:10] down and now also in post-production I
[47:12] have uh I have help. Um, so it's it gets
[47:16] easier because like the process is
[47:17] always very much the same. Uh, just the
[47:20] conversation is different. Uh, but I
[47:23] imagine if you do a documentary, you
[47:26] have to fly there. Like there's so many
[47:28] there's so many other aspects to it that
[47:31] m makes it harder. Uh, and and I just
[47:34] sit on my ass every day on the same on
[47:36] in the same studio.
[47:39] Yeah, it's so hard. And that's
[47:41] ultimately why like I had I had trouble
[47:43] scaling it up because it's it was so
[47:45] much time as well as my documentaries
[47:48] were living from my cutting style and
[47:50] from my style which I did it. So I
[47:53] couldn't like even get help on the
[47:55] editing part of things. So uh yeah
[47:58] that's why ultimately I I founded 21c
[48:02] studios because I said oh there's like a
[48:04] huge problem here like making those kind
[48:06] of stuff. there's nobody here,
[48:08] especially if you're in the Bitcoin um
[48:10] space. So now I have a full team who are
[48:13] actually able to do that which I wanted
[48:15] to do. Um, but me personally, I also I
[48:18] like it more now having this one process
[48:20] with having the podcast, knowing how to
[48:22] do the editing and uh not needing to
[48:26] travel somewhere, meet people and so on
[48:28] because it's I did it for 3 years and
[48:31] it's a lot of work and it's also uh how
[48:35] do you Yeah,
[48:36] it's I think I'm going to start working
[48:39] on those things again and I have one big
[48:42] documentary which I'm still working on
[48:44] but uh For now, I'm more focused on the
[48:47] bottom. Absolutely. Really cool. What
[48:50] kind of um how do you look at the new
[48:52] world that Bitcoin creates uh from what
[48:56] we just talked about in the last 20
[48:58] minutes of bitco people actually uh
[49:01] getting more freedom and more creativity
[49:04] and more of like hey I can actually do
[49:07] what I really enjoy and maybe I find a
[49:09] market there and and replace my my
[49:12] previous income which I maybe was not
[49:14] that happy with like it seems like a
[49:17] radical shift in in in the whole system
[49:20] which probably takes a long time but
[49:22] it's it's really interesting to think
[49:23] about that. Yeah, I think I think
[49:26] there's a couple of um things that's
[49:29] going to happen there. One one thing
[49:31] which I think is that definitely there
[49:34] will be way more smaller companies or
[49:36] service providers because it's just like
[49:39] anybody who who wants to do that or has
[49:42] the ability now has also the freedom
[49:44] that if he works let's say 5 years or
[49:46] something he can actually stop working
[49:48] at the the bigger company and just spin
[49:50] up
[49:52] uh his own version of whatever he's
[49:54] doing. And I think there's a massive
[49:56] benefit to that because um you can then
[50:01] create like those hyperfocused agencies
[50:03] or services which will um provide the
[50:07] other people with even better value
[50:10] where it's like not everything actually
[50:11] needs to be um you going through one
[50:15] company but you have all of all of the
[50:17] small companies um which yeah have
[50:21] enough financing to actually do good
[50:25] work because one thing especially when
[50:27] we look at creative things they mostly
[50:30] work on a smaller scale it's very hard
[50:33] to scale creativity so I think because
[50:36] of this we are will have more artists
[50:38] who can live from what they're doing we
[50:41] will have more creators we will have
[50:43] more creative agencies designers and all
[50:46] of this whereas now like most of the
[50:49] designing happening I'm not too much in
[50:51] the fashion industry but I'm just
[50:54] assuming assuming that most of it is
[50:56] financed by the big companies Sara
[50:59] um Louis Vuittor and like there's not a
[51:02] lot of creative freedom anymore which is
[51:05] like from the grassroots and so I hope
[51:08] that this will enable this that people
[51:12] just do their own stuff again and it's
[51:14] not anywhere you go you have this big
[51:18] Zara Louis Vuitton and so on but you
[51:20] have a small boutique you know maybe
[51:23] Robin is having his own t-shirt
[51:25] manufacturing thing and I think it's
[51:27] going to have like a very
[51:30] positive impact on um first companies
[51:34] but also people families I mean you see
[51:36] it with Bitcoiners all Bitcoiners who I
[51:39] know change radically and to the better.
[51:43] So I'm just assuming that this will
[51:44] happen on all aspects of life. I do. So
[51:48] yeah, uh it's it's interesting with like
[51:52] t-shirts because like YouTube uh as you
[51:54] probably know gives the opportunity of
[51:56] like just placing things on and I and
[51:58] and I made those those those t-shirts
[52:00] but
[52:01] uh it's it's definitely not my creative
[52:05] um wonder that I it's it's not something
[52:09] that I'm really passionate about, but
[52:11] it's it definitely interesting of like
[52:13] what what it empowers to do. Um, one
[52:15] thing you you also made the documentary
[52:17] on on El Salvador. Um, what have you
[52:19] learned there from actual Bitcoin
[52:22] adoption? I think El Salvador is one of
[52:24] the regions uh where it's already uh
[52:27] really good developed. There are it's
[52:29] it's it's probably not as as as good as
[52:32] as as something as especially as I saw
[52:34] last November when I when I was myself
[52:37] there. But uh what have you seen uh
[52:40] around El Salvador and how do you think
[52:42] about the the grassroots adoption uh
[52:44] there? So I always I always like to
[52:48] contrast it to Costa Rica where I've
[52:50] been as well in the Bitcoin jungle and I
[52:54] would say there like there's a huge
[52:55] difference in both approaches whereas El
[52:57] Salvador they adopting Bitcoin from the
[53:01] top but Costa Rica adopted it to a
[53:04] certain degree grassroots because
[53:06] officially they didn't adopt anything
[53:08] there right but um in Costa Rica what
[53:12] happened there there was like a
[53:15] uh community leader who was very much
[53:17] into Bitcoin and they saw the issue that
[53:19] some markets some farmers markets
[53:21] actually couldn't really use um normal
[53:25] payment rails because it was too
[53:27] expensive for them. So they actually
[53:29] slowly but surely started orange pilling
[53:31] all of those people. And right now it's
[53:33] insane what's happening there. Like
[53:35] there there's like a there are it's
[53:38] still smaller villages but there are
[53:40] areas within Costa Rica where everybody
[53:42] understands Bitcoin. You don't need to
[53:43] understand what lightning is. You don't
[53:45] uh it's like everything works there.
[53:47] It's like truly bitcoiners they they
[53:51] because they were so interested after
[53:52] using it in the farmers market most of
[53:54] them actually educated themselves and
[53:57] whereas when I was in El Salvador that
[54:00] wasn't really the case and and I I'm my
[54:04] hypothesis or theory is that it because
[54:07] it's from the top down. Um so what
[54:10] happened there was okay the the
[54:11] government said okay you need to accept
[54:13] bitcoin from today at uh to onwards and
[54:18] a lot of people didn't know what that
[54:20] actually means and what the benefit was
[54:22] because it was just like a governmental
[54:23] decree and so I think because of this
[54:28] also the adoption kind of stalled a
[54:30] little bit within El Salvador I wouldn't
[54:32] say that it's bad or anything for how
[54:35] many years was it now I think three or
[54:37] maybe four I don't even November but for
[54:40] that the amount of Bitcoin um Bitcoin
[54:44] accepting businesses is decent I would
[54:47] say but the issue which I have with that
[54:50] is like they don't really care about it
[54:52] because it was this thing which was was
[54:54] induced but onto them um and in Costa
[54:57] Rica I really see how people actively
[54:59] want to contribute really help to get
[55:03] this Bitcoin ecosystem growing um so
[55:08] Yeah, but also having like having said
[55:11] all of this, I think El Salvador is
[55:13] still like further than most countries
[55:16] and actually has like this huge Bitcoin
[55:19] adoption which is great. Um, but if I
[55:22] compare to Costa Rica, I still have a
[55:24] couple of things which I would say we as
[55:27] Bitcoin community need to learn that
[55:30] it's more important to showcase those
[55:32] people how their life could be better by
[55:35] using Bitcoin rather than just telling
[55:37] them, hey, use Bitcoin and it's going to
[55:38] be better because ultimately a lot of
[55:41] people don't really care um what it can
[55:45] do, but they care about how it can
[55:47] improve their lives. And I think we as
[55:50] Bitcoiners often uh forget focusing on
[55:54] the letter latter part but focus on the
[55:56] first part where it's like oh my god it
[55:58] has 21 million hard cap. Oh the
[56:00] difficulty adjustment. But the normal
[56:02] people is like yeah I don't care about
[56:04] that. What does it actually improve for
[56:07] my life? And in Costa Rica the people
[56:09] then saw oh I don't need to pay the 3%.
[56:12] That's actually a huge benefit for me.
[56:15] for other people is going to be, oh, I
[56:17] don't I I I'm not panalyzed by 2%
[56:20] inflation every year. So, that's I think
[56:24] uh a very long answer to what I've
[56:27] learned when I was in El Salvador that
[56:28] we as Bitcoiners need to focus on how
[56:30] Bitcoin actually improves others lives
[56:33] because we often feel it. But I think by
[56:38] communicating this to other people,
[56:40] we're actually more um like we will be
[56:43] able to better orange pill more people.
[56:47] I also thought about that um uh myself
[56:52] like maybe it would be more powerful if
[56:55] we focus on real world people's stories
[57:00] um um and think and tell those stories
[57:04] of like how Bitcoin improved their lives
[57:07] um and go away
[57:09] from making more more content around
[57:12] okay like that's how Bitcoin works
[57:14] that's why it will overtake the the the
[57:17] financial system uh and and then all
[57:20] those questions come up of like oh like
[57:21] will the government not ban it and and
[57:24] all those things but if you have a of a
[57:27] story of like oh like he adopted Bitcoin
[57:29] then he did this and and that's how how
[57:32] it it really helped him do this small
[57:35] shop there and um I think those real
[57:38] world stories uh probably will work
[57:42] better with the general population uh
[57:44] and and It's probably a story that I can
[57:47] send better to my sister than like uh
[57:50] some some 40inut video where the
[57:54] properties of Bitcoin I explain and why
[57:55] it's the best money and after 10 minutes
[57:58] everyone clicked off and like oh like
[58:00] that's like the hardcore Bitcoiners love
[58:02] that. Uh and and it's the question of
[58:05] like
[58:06] okay if we create content for hardcore
[58:09] bitcoiners it's different to for the
[58:11] general population like the hardcore
[58:12] bitcoiners love talking about monetary
[58:15] things and then how how how bitcoin will
[58:18] shake out in the next 10 years and how
[58:20] the adoption is going and and how US
[58:22] dollar is failing and stuff like that.
[58:24] Uh that's why for example a book like uh
[58:27] the new one from Larry Leai is very
[58:29] popular. Um, but I feel like there's a
[58:32] big need for real stories just like I
[58:35] don't know like 10 great Bitcoiners in
[58:38] one book of of how Bitcoin transformed
[58:40] their their their lives and it's real
[58:42] world stories that are nicely written
[58:44] even like documentary style um movies
[58:47] around that. I think that's kind of
[58:49] probably that orange pills more people
[58:51] than oh we have a 21 million cap.
[58:54] Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. And that's al
[58:56] that's also what I tried or still trying
[58:59] with my content. Like I I most of my
[59:02] content and documentaries especially I
[59:04] never talk about technical stuff. It's
[59:06] always just showcasing like for example
[59:08] the silent revolution of Africa. I like
[59:12] I just give the the minimal context to
[59:15] understand what Bitcoin is if you have
[59:16] no idea. But it's actually just showing
[59:18] how kids use it, why the kids use it.
[59:20] And there's like this one example which
[59:22] which was very uh yeah memorable where
[59:26] one guy said the main the main reason
[59:30] why he uses Bitcoin is his parents they
[59:33] were so poor that he he's working and he
[59:37] always had his money in cash but his
[59:40] parents because he was so poor actually
[59:42] stole his money from his um from under
[59:45] his mattress. So that's why he now
[59:48] stores his wealth or his earnings in
[59:50] Bitcoin because he's sure that his own
[59:53] parents won't be able to steal the money
[59:56] from him. Amazing. That that's a that's
[59:58] a heck of a story.
[60:01] It's like to get get your money safe
[60:04] from your own parents.
[60:06] Yeah. But that's the reality, you know,
[60:08] that's like we as westerners um you know
[60:11] that's that's not even the use case. I
[60:13] guess most people actually contribute or
[60:15] like think about when they talk about
[60:17] Bitcoin because it's just like, oh yeah,
[60:19] we need a hard cap inflation D. It's
[60:21] like if you don't even are able to store
[60:24] $5 um until the next day because your
[60:27] parents steal it, like you don't care
[60:29] about the hard cap. You don't care about
[60:32] um the difficulty adjustment. And but
[60:36] this I think is the amazing thing about
[60:39] Bitcoin that it's a solution for so many
[60:42] problems we have today. And that's how
[60:45] we started the podcast right there.
[60:47] Bitcoin has so many different angles.
[60:48] You can talk about it from so different
[60:50] different things. But we all still don't
[60:53] really know what Bitcoin really is
[60:56] because it's so multifaceted. And
[60:58] therefore the more people translate this
[61:02] phenomenon which Bitcoin is into
[61:04] different use cases, different
[61:08] applications, different languages,
[61:10] whatever you want to say, then we will
[61:13] get closer to the true potential of
[61:15] Bitcoin to the this true future which it
[61:18] actually enables us to to create. But we
[61:21] need those people to do that because
[61:23] even this small like African boy, right?
[61:27] I would have never thought that this is
[61:29] a use case of Bitcoin like not being
[61:31] being stolen from from your parents and
[61:34] by going all together onto this um path
[61:38] of trying to figure out what Bitcoin is.
[61:40] That's how we are actually enable uh
[61:43] actually having the potential to unlock
[61:46] what Bitcoin is because I think nobody
[61:48] truly yet knows what Bitcoin will be
[61:50] able to achieve in the future.
[61:52] Absolutely. Um you mentioned Nostra
[61:55] before. How does Nostra play into all
[61:58] those Bitcoin things now as you also as
[62:02] yourself on on social media outside of
[62:04] Nostra? Uh how do you think Nostra will
[62:06] play into this Bitcoin world? Yeah,
[62:09] Nostra is my favorite social media uh
[62:13] yeah I don't want to say application or
[62:15] platform because it's a protocol but um
[62:19] yeah my my my favorite social media
[62:21] which I'm using right now because uh it
[62:23] has right now Bitcoin seemingly
[62:25] integrated. So what is Noster? Noster is
[62:28] a protocol on which you have your
[62:30] account and no one can shut it down. you
[62:32] can uh use it however you want it on
[62:35] which app you want and but it's still
[62:37] one account and uh within this account
[62:40] there's like this na native integration
[62:42] of bitcoin so you have like your wallet
[62:44] you can use it um instead of liking you
[62:47] can send bitcoin and I think it's it's a
[62:50] really powerful tool um like we can talk
[62:54] about nost
[62:56] uh nost individually and bitcoin
[62:59] individually but putting both of those
[63:02] together are actually a very interesting
[63:04] use case because by putting them
[63:05] together you create a day-to-day use
[63:10] case for Bitcoin which um finally
[63:15] enables true microp payments. Everybody
[63:17] always talked about oh we need microp
[63:19] payments we need an application or like
[63:21] we need a way to do that. That's what um
[63:24] a lot of people early on in Bitcoin
[63:27] Yeah. were were saying that that's a bad
[63:31] thing about Bitcoin that we can't have
[63:33] those microp payments. But now by
[63:35] combining Noster with Bitcoin, I use
[63:39] microp payments every single day. I'm
[63:41] always sapping people. I'm always
[63:43] interacting with them. And so I think
[63:47] Noser is one of those
[63:49] um one of
[63:51] those applications or protocols of bit
[63:56] uh one of those applications of Bitcoin
[63:59] which will also orange pill a lot of
[64:02] people. So I know a lot of nostrils
[64:03] which never used Bitcoin before but
[64:06] because they had this opportunity to zap
[64:08] or receive Bitcoin then they looked into
[64:10] Bitcoin what it is. Um, so yeah, that's
[64:15] kind of like what I really like about it
[64:16] now. But obviously the the potential of
[64:19] Nostra is even bigger. It's it's the
[64:22] same thing with Bitcoin. I think we are
[64:24] like
[64:26] 2012 of Bitcoin is where we are right
[64:28] now with Noster. There's still so many
[64:31] challenges which we have to overcome.
[64:33] There are so many opportunities. But
[64:35] it's pretty cool to see those being
[64:37] solved every day and being solved in
[64:39] front of your eyes and kind of being
[64:40] part of it.
[64:42] And yeah, that's my first comment on
[64:45] Nostra. I I think it's it's it's great
[64:48] what we see with Nostra and I think it's
[64:50] a a small window that we will see
[64:53] everywhere where Bitcoin is so deeply
[64:55] integrated in something that people
[64:57] don't even notice that they use Bitcoin
[65:00] because all of the they're just having a
[65:02] wallet on Primal and they're just
[65:04] sapping people. Uh and they don't
[65:07] necessarily have to know about Bitcoin.
[65:09] uh they don't necessarily have to know
[65:11] what's going on with the lightning
[65:13] protocol and doing it with Bitcoin and
[65:15] and channels and all those things.
[65:17] They're like, "Oh, like I just su uh 50
[65:21] Satoshi's there." Like, okay, what is a
[65:23] Satoshi? I don't care. It's it's a
[65:25] value. Uh so, so I think uh mo most
[65:30] people probably will be never orange pe
[65:33] even though they will use Bitcoin every
[65:36] day. Yeah. So that that's probably how
[65:38] it will end up uh being in the long run
[65:41] the same way as as everyone uses the
[65:43] TCPIP protocol every day. But how many
[65:46] people can really explain it in detail
[65:48] like I don't know like maybe 0.5% of the
[65:51] world anything like that. Exactly. And
[65:53] and I mean uh I think Peter Teal said
[65:56] that that like technologies inherently
[65:59] are supposed to make your life easier
[66:01] and not harder. And I think for a lot of
[66:03] people, we're still in the stage where
[66:05] uh Bitcoin, if they would need it, it's
[66:08] still making their life a little bit
[66:09] harder than it actually should be. But
[66:11] we're getting very very gradually and
[66:13] slowly to that point where this is
[66:15] actually not the case anymore. Where you
[66:17] don't even, like you said, on no, you
[66:19] don't need to care about it anymore. You
[66:21] don't need to set up any wallet. You
[66:23] don't need to even um like open
[66:26] lightning channels or something like
[66:28] that. It just works. And as soon as we
[66:31] are at that point where the technology
[66:34] makes your life actually easier than
[66:37] harder, I think then we're ready for
[66:39] like all the mass adoption of one
[66:42] Bitcoin, but also of Noster. Um, and
[66:46] that's why I think it's so cool to see
[66:49] how how we're getting there because I I
[66:51] still remember when I joined Noster, I
[66:53] needed to figure out how to upload a
[66:56] picture to a web server and then link
[66:58] this web server to the protocol. And
[67:00] only by doing that, I had a profile
[67:02] picture. And that's something like, you
[67:05] know, I'm I'm pretty young. Um, I never
[67:08] I I didn't experience early internet for
[67:10] me. Uh, it kind of worked. Of course,
[67:14] the UX improved massively, but being
[67:18] being onto something which act actually
[67:20] breaks now like it that not often there
[67:24] are still periods where nostra doesn't
[67:25] work properly because there's something
[67:27] happening. Uh it's kind of cool to see
[67:29] because um when was the last time that
[67:32] you I don't know saw some some big trend
[67:36] happening in front of your eyes and
[67:37] actually have the opportunity to to be
[67:39] part of it and uh therefore yeah I think
[67:44] Nostra is very
[67:47] fascinating like many revolutions going
[67:50] on in in front of our eyes with Bitcoin
[67:52] and Nostra and I agree uh the the the
[67:55] first internet website that I can
[67:57] remember was already Google. Uh so it's
[68:00] like that that was the first one that I
[68:02] opened. Uh so I I jumped a lot
[68:05] of previous attempts at the internet and
[68:09] and computing technology in general. Uh
[68:12] uh and it's so cool to talk with people
[68:14] that are like born in 1960 1970 or
[68:17] something like that where like okay how
[68:19] was the internet adoption and and then
[68:21] comparing that to Bitcoin and seeing the
[68:23] parallels even of that uh it's is really
[68:26] fun to to do those things. Yeah. Yeah.
[68:29] Really cool. Um what are uh before we
[68:32] come to the to the Android teams uh what
[68:35] are some of your future product projects
[68:38] that you are um excited about?
[68:41] So
[68:43] I'm I started working on uh the second
[68:46] no documentary that's like um still in
[68:50] like filming um filming phase right now.
[68:52] I have still a lot of open questions on
[68:55] like until I'm actively be able to start
[68:58] editing and do the proper work. But uh
[69:01] that's something which I started then uh
[69:04] yeah my main focus is on 21c helping
[69:06] other brands as well uh to create like
[69:10] good bitcoin content. Uh that's kind of
[69:13] like my main focus right now as well as
[69:15] proof of health which is the podcast uh
[69:18] where I actually what I said as well I
[69:21] just chose the angle of Bitcoin which
[69:24] I'm most interested about which is
[69:25] currently health and I'm just trying to
[69:28] learn as much as possible by um having
[69:31] experts on there because I'm not a
[69:33] health expert. I'm just trying things
[69:35] myself um experimenting but I didn't
[69:38] learn this. I I'm not a medical doctor.
[69:41] I am not a physician, but there are so
[69:44] many different things that I want to
[69:47] learn about it. So, that's kind of like
[69:50] my personal journey of uh what I'm going
[69:54] to be focused on because that's what
[69:57] gets me up at night and I'm yeah excited
[70:00] about. Really cool. I'm uh will be fun
[70:03] to see that. Um I've I've asked one
[70:07] question to each and every one of my
[70:08] guests and the question is what can we
[70:09] learn from you besides Bitcoin?
[70:12] Oh besides Bitcoin but Bitcoin touches
[70:15] everything
[70:17] sir. Um I think besides
[70:21] Bitcoin
[70:23] is
[70:26] that I had a talk in El Salvador and in
[70:30] Japan um during the last two years which
[70:33] I titled stop consuming and start
[70:36] creating. And I think the one thing
[70:39] which people can learn from me besides
[70:42] Bitcoin is that it is extremely
[70:46] rewarding to start switching your life
[70:50] from consuming all of the content,
[70:53] consuming other people's thoughts,
[70:55] consuming other people's lives to
[70:58] actually focus on your own life. And I
[71:02] think the way of doing that is by
[71:03] actually actively start creating. That
[71:06] doesn't mean you need to be a content
[71:07] creator or post about it, but just
[71:11] creating different things. Be it um like
[71:15] experiences which you want to create,
[71:16] create a family, build something instead
[71:20] of just being this passive
[71:23] um person who's living other people's
[71:25] life.
[71:27] And the way I
[71:30] um I would tell anybody to do that is
[71:34] kind of like just trust in your own
[71:38] viewpoint of things. If it's Bitcoin, if
[71:41] it's um whatever topic you're interested
[71:44] in, and then gradually just start
[71:46] writing your thoughts down and putting
[71:49] things out in the universe, and it's
[71:51] going to be highly rewarding. You never
[71:53] know who's going to see it. You never
[71:54] know what's going to happen from it, but
[71:58] uh stop consuming and start creating.
[72:01] Yeah, there's this the there's this re I
[72:05] I I want to add one small caveat to that
[72:07] because I really love that message and I
[72:10] talked about that um a lot not on the
[72:13] podcast actually. is a topic that I've
[72:14] not discussed too much on the podcast,
[72:16] but like the difference between
[72:18] consuming and actively learning, like
[72:21] passively consuming just like whatever
[72:23] and just like letting yourself go with
[72:26] the algorithms and the the Netflixes and
[72:29] anything like that. uh and just like
[72:31] actively like oh like seeking out
[72:33] content and and actively learning and
[72:35] then creating something with that or
[72:37] having some kind of things with that uh
[72:40] instead of like just passively consuming
[72:43] and sleeping. Exactly. And like actively
[72:46] learning something actively educating
[72:48] yourself something and then creating
[72:50] with that. I think that's a that's a
[72:52] really cool concept. Uh thank you so
[72:54] much for bringing that on the podcast.
[72:56] Yeah, I I totally agree man. uh like
[73:00] even like if if consuming if you consume
[73:03] with the intention to create something
[73:05] yourself like that's the right thing to
[73:07] do but just as you said like living as
[73:09] the algorithmic slave and just consuming
[73:12] anything which has no connection to who
[73:15] you are what you're trying to achieve is
[73:18] ultimately time wasted and I don't think
[73:20] that like you you there you you don't
[73:23] need to get rid of it 100% but just try
[73:26] to focus more on the creation side or
[73:28] the active consuming side rather than
[73:31] just be in the passive consuming side
[73:34] because I think most people default into
[73:36] this in our world today. So um by making
[73:40] an active effort to get out of this I
[73:42] think you will increase your life
[73:44] quality drastically. Yeah, there's also
[73:46] like this uh you need to figure out like
[73:49] how to make a break. So some sometimes
[73:51] it's cool to just like
[73:53] lay back and and not do anything. Uh but
[73:56] maybe it's better to take a walk instead
[73:58] of watching Netflix or uh Tik Toks.
[74:01] Actually,
[74:03] um really cool. We have Andrew in the
[74:05] podcast where the previous guest is
[74:06] asking a question for the next guest
[74:07] without knowing who the next guest
[74:08] actually is. And the previous guest asks
[74:11] you the question, what is
[74:14] uh what is your highest purpose in life?
[74:16] It's one of the rare non Bitcoin
[74:18] questions, but it's a good one. What is
[74:21] my highest purpose of life? if I would
[74:24] boil it down in one sentence is becoming
[74:27] the best version of myself
[74:29] possible. And that then includes all of
[74:32] the other aspects of life. Building
[74:34] health healthy relationships, healthy
[74:36] businesses, healthy um sleeping
[74:39] routines, all of that. Yeah, I think I
[74:42] think that's that's probably it. I love
[74:44] that. Thank you so much, Max, for for
[74:46] being on before I let you go. Uh where
[74:48] can people find you, ask you questions,
[74:49] and reach out to you? Yeah, I'm Max
[74:52] DeMarco. You can find me on Noster. You
[74:56] can find me on Twitter, on YouTube, and
[74:59] yeah, if you have a podcast or a Bitcoin
[75:02] business and need more um Bitcoin
[75:05] content, feel free to reach out to 21C
[75:08] Studios. You can find my email there as
[75:10] well.
[75:12] And yeah, other than that, on my
[75:15] podcast, Proof of Health, if you're
[75:16] interested in Bitcoin and living a
[75:18] healthy life, make sure to listen to the
[75:22] episodes there. But other than that,
[75:24] hopefully going to see you guys in real
[75:28] life somewhere. Um, I think the fastest
[75:30] and biggest place where we probably see
[75:32] each other, um, uh, the people that are
[75:35] here and and maybe you also are in
[75:38] Prague, a bit to go there. Yeah. are
[75:41] really cool. Yeah, it's it's I think
[75:43] it's the it's one of my favorite uh
[75:47] conferences especially also in Europe.
[75:49] Uh so yeah, will be fun to to go there
[75:51] and yeah, thank you so much for for
[75:52] being on the show. Also, thank you so
[75:54] much for everyone that is watching and
[75:55] listening uh for joining us today. As
[75:57] always, I'll be back tomorrow with
[75:59] another episode. Bye-bye.
