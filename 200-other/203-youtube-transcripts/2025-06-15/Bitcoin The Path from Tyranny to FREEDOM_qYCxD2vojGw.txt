[00:00] I'm going to burn with Bitcoin if
[00:01] Bitcoin goes minus $100 I'm still going
[00:04] to stack sets if Bitcoin makes me poorer
[00:06] every year I'm still going to stack set
[00:08] and I'm going to try to work hard to
[00:10] rehabilitate the system they gave
[00:11] everybody in Canada a $600 check but
[00:14] they gave the Insiders billions of
[00:16] dollars I expect total victory for
[00:18] Bitcoin if bitcoiners are smart enough
[00:20] they're going to get organized and
[00:22] they're going to push back and we're
[00:23] going to reclaim our countries and we're
[00:25] going to Build a Better World we're at
[00:26] the same moment at history when the
[00:29] French Revolution was starting to gain
[00:31] momentum and that everybody realized
[00:33] that absolute monarchies were obsolete
[00:35] Bitcoin is not left is not right it's
[00:37] not pro Russia is not pro America is
[00:40] just a ledger anchored in mathematics
[00:42] and physics decentralized with energy as
[00:45] it
[00:46] backb I actually want to start with with
[00:48] the the the question that I asked you
[00:50] before we started the recording um with
[00:53] you quitted your job I see see it more
[00:56] more that bitcoiners are like uh sick
[00:58] with their fear job they sick with their
[01:00] Fiat system in general um so I guess you
[01:04] quit your job and it played a Bitcoin
[01:06] played a big role in that right well
[01:09] listen I've been working uh like in in
[01:12] Canadian politics and obviously politics
[01:15] is never perfect okay because you need
[01:17] to reach a consensus and to reach a
[01:19] consensus well you need to sacrifice
[01:21] many uh stuff that are orted for you to
[01:24] reach you know that middle ground and I
[01:27] could understand that but like something
[01:30] happened before covid where almost it
[01:32] seems like uh you know the the Western
[01:35] Government got activated and they went
[01:38] against everything that every everything
[01:40] that are the Western values you know the
[01:42] freedom of speech the individual
[01:45] freedoms the freedoms to protest the
[01:47] freedom to choose you know what you're
[01:49] going to do with your own body and stuff
[01:52] like that I feel that like uh the world
[01:55] almost turned upside upside down for and
[01:58] at the beginning during the pandemic I
[02:00] mean I was uh I was helping people
[02:03] through my job and you know doing my
[02:05] stuff and uh I had people call me crying
[02:08] you know where like Canada is destroyed
[02:10] and I'm like no Canada is not destroyed
[02:12] it's temporary you know and then came
[02:15] the inflation because at first they told
[02:17] us listen if we print tons of money uh
[02:20] it's not going to be a problem because
[02:21] this of that they lied so uh they gave
[02:24] everybody in Canada a $600 check but
[02:27] they gave the Insiders billions of
[02:30] dollars and I mean it was the biggest
[02:32] wealth transfer from the middle class to
[02:34] the Elites in the history also the world
[02:37] since we record the the money so they
[02:40] basically pillaged the public treasure
[02:43] so there I felt really uncomfortable
[02:46] with everything how it was playing out
[02:48] because I know they basically lied to us
[02:50] about everything and finally came Gaza
[02:54] the genocide in Gaza and that was last
[02:58] my my last TR and I was like I I
[03:00] couldn't focus I couldn't do my job
[03:03] anymore because I saw the Western
[03:04] Government you know whitewash ongoing
[03:07] genocide continue to support it through
[03:10] uh military aid and other financial
[03:12] means and uh like all of the N sense and
[03:16] and the hypocrisy going around it it
[03:19] failed me it for me it became impossible
[03:22] and already I mean I was uh I was in
[03:24] Bitcoin I was posting I was
[03:27] listening to podcast talking to people
[03:29] people I every week I try to Orange
[03:32] peill somebody and I haven't stopped you
[03:33] know every week it can be anybody I I
[03:36] just like to put the information in the
[03:39] brain and after it's up to them to
[03:40] decide but the genocide was really my
[03:43] last STW and like uh they the I parted
[03:47] ways for now with Canadian politics but
[03:51] I'm a political organizer so for me I'm
[03:54] going to do politics all my life knowing
[03:56] different it can be on the municipal
[03:58] level it can be on the provincial level
[04:00] it can be on the federal level because
[04:02] I'm not the kind of bitcoiner as we see
[04:05] a lot on Hicks that say the that have
[04:08] that fear of the government because my
[04:10] view is if you don't take care of
[04:12] politics politics is going to take care
[04:14] of you politics is just a peaceful Arena
[04:18] but voting is a powerful thing because
[04:21] it's when you vote for somebody it means
[04:25] that if it wasn't a peaceful system
[04:28] where you can make your views known to
[04:31] voting this is where you would be
[04:33] fighting so that that's what it is it's
[04:35] it's a cast system of uh it's a play of
[04:39] power but what what I can tell to your
[04:41] audience is that in Canada at least the
[04:45] system works the system was made by
[04:48] God-fearing men that were much smarter
[04:50] than us that were much closer to God
[04:52] than us that were much more uh Statesmen
[04:56] than the garbage people that we have
[04:58] running our countries
[05:00] and these people they made a a
[05:01] functional system that has been abused
[05:05] and it's not the system that's
[05:06] dysfunctional it's that there's people
[05:08] not doing their jobs when you do
[05:11] corruption when you do uh like
[05:13] supporting a genocide in Canada is
[05:15] illegal so any Minister that sent uh
[05:17] Weaponry to Israel during that act uh
[05:21] should be put on trial I mean it's
[05:24] illegal it's illegal in Canada to do it
[05:26] but like in in United States the same
[05:29] things that Canada there's a lot of
[05:31] Institutions that are corrupted and that
[05:33] don't do their job anymore so for me I
[05:36] decided that for now I'm going to focus
[05:39] entirely on bitcoin and try to do that
[05:41] next step in Bitcoin and uh but as I I'm
[05:45] telling you uh I'm going to be
[05:46] interested in it on my life and continue
[05:48] to go back which uh is kind of the the
[05:53] topic that I released today with the
[05:55] guest um and I want to ask you also this
[05:58] this question that uh he became at as
[06:01] the last question from another guest
[06:03] from our Andrew team um he was like when
[06:06] the question was like when would you
[06:07] flee your country which raises an
[06:09] interesting question um when hits
[06:12] the fan in your country I don't know in
[06:14] Canada something even more dramatic
[06:17] happens or in whatever country you are
[06:19] uh and then uh you have to decide okay
[06:22] do I fight and get involved in the
[06:25] politics in my country and try to change
[06:27] something where I live currently where
[06:30] my family is where my roots are or is it
[06:33] not worth the risk or is it not worth
[06:35] the hustle and I just flee to a Bitcoin
[06:38] country like El Salvador like uh so many
[06:41] other countries where they're a little
[06:42] bit more friendly to it even Swiss and
[06:44] Europe and stuff like that would you
[06:47] rather like are you the personality that
[06:50] says like okay let's let's go to another
[06:51] country obviously when the politics
[06:53] up here then we can flee or would you
[06:57] stay and say like oh let's fight for the
[06:59] here let's fix our uh Financial system
[07:02] here like or or where's the point where
[07:04] you would say like I have to flee
[07:06] now well it's a it's a it's a funny
[07:10] question because I'm not born in Canada
[07:12] I'm born in bostn her I fled bostn as a
[07:15] child when I was 10 years old as a war
[07:18] Refugee so I've been in the Civil War in
[07:22] ex Yugoslavia I've been wounded it both
[07:24] of my legs as a child uh as a civilian
[07:28] and so I fled with my mother my initial
[07:31] country to go to Canada but the the
[07:33] fling wasn't up to me it was a decision
[07:35] that my mother made that my father got
[07:37] killed and you know it was awful the war
[07:39] we didn't have anything to beat so we
[07:42] came to Canada but for me it's different
[07:44] I would never flee the country because I
[07:47] understand that uh the system now is
[07:49] global anyway and these forces that are
[07:51] going to destroy Canada today well
[07:54] they're they're going to destroy El
[07:56] Salvador to more so the goal is not to
[07:58] flee the countries is to restore every
[08:02] country to the values to our you know
[08:06] Western civilized values democratic
[08:10] values that are not perfect but to
[08:12] restore every country to the ideas of
[08:15] Enlightenment because now what we are
[08:17] seeing basically is hidden autocracies
[08:20] the the the the the revolutions have
[08:22] been hijacked all across you know and
[08:25] now you have a cast that's running these
[08:27] countries that are completely
[08:29] disconnected from the masses that live
[08:32] in Ivory Towers literally that have
[08:35] their matches Villas Ys okay and not
[08:38] they they they don't give a about
[08:40] what's going on with the masses so it's
[08:42] up to us to understand that and not to
[08:45] be in a fleing mode but you know
[08:47] obviously if there's a warlike situation
[08:51] and temporarily you need to move your
[08:53] family and yourself to safety I will
[08:55] never judge that but I think that every
[08:58] Citizen's Duty is to stay and fight for
[09:02] what he thinks his country should be and
[09:05] I mean we're not going to agree even me
[09:06] and you we won't agree on many things
[09:08] how we see our country uh should be but
[09:12] we can agree on the minimum on a country
[09:15] being peaceful uh not crime ridden not
[09:18] corruption ridden not pollution ridden
[09:21] you know and these things because the
[09:23] problem we have right now is that the
[09:25] people in charge are just blatantly liy
[09:29] to but and the masses they are blind to
[09:32] their lives because first of all they
[09:34] don't understand how money works and the
[09:37] core of all of our problems are in the
[09:39] money so that's why Bitcoin is such a
[09:41] huge thing and that's why it exploded my
[09:43] brain when I finally understood what it
[09:45] is so no my answer is I would not flee
[09:48] and even now I see Canada as my country
[09:50] too I see BOS as my country I see Canada
[09:53] as my country and I see every you know
[09:56] uh country that uh that that uh wants to
[10:01] better it citizenry and you know
[10:04] everybody else as my country as well I I
[10:06] would help defend El Salvador I I'm I'm
[10:09] posting a lot about America because I
[10:11] was always an American ofil and I think
[10:14] that the ideals of the American framers
[10:17] are very important and they're not an
[10:19] isol American Revolution is not an
[10:22] isolated act it was a continuation of
[10:25] the mankind struggle towards freedom God
[10:27] and liberty and prosperity individual
[10:30] rights and stuff like that so for me I
[10:33] don't think anybody should be looking at
[10:35] in that way to flee you know because at
[10:38] the end of the day it's going to catch
[10:39] us up no matter where you're at so while
[10:43] we're young better to focus and spread
[10:46] our ideas and and do the things that we
[10:48] can not everybody should go in politics
[10:51] either you know you you can be political
[10:54] in many ways fing is being political
[10:57] talking about Bitcoin is being political
[11:00] Bitcoin is a very political thing
[11:02] because we want to defund the state we
[11:05] want to take the money from the hands of
[11:07] the state and put it again in the hands
[11:09] of the people so that's very political
[11:12] so that's why I I I posted the other day
[11:15] a short video you know when these uh
[11:18] Samurai guys got arrested tell the
[11:21] people what did you expect it's going to
[11:23] get much worse than that like don't
[11:25] think that these uh El Elites are just
[11:27] going to let us you know uh create this
[11:30] whole new world that is more just more
[11:33] decentralized and and nothing about I
[11:36] mean this is just a small example it can
[11:39] it can be very very worth so then we
[11:42] need to organize it to fight back push
[11:44] back and to uh to try to fix our PES
[11:48] what what do you expect as a attacks
[11:50] like uh you you were talking of attacks
[11:53] from the FEI system against Bitcoin
[11:55] against Bitcoin companies so the the
[11:58] attacks that they started like I feel
[12:00] like 2013 was kind of the first real
[12:03] Attack From China against Bitcoin ever
[12:06] since they tried and try it a little bit
[12:08] more and a little more aggressive it has
[12:10] less and less impact of course on
[12:12] bitcoin because Bitcoin becomes more and
[12:13] more big and more and more stable but is
[12:16] there something that you uh like foresee
[12:19] or something that you expect that they
[12:22] they will definitely try well first of
[12:25] all I expect toal victory for Bitcoin
[12:27] why because it was attacked by China and
[12:29] it was attacked by the United States of
[12:31] America and it's still survived and
[12:33] still ongoing and it's stronger than
[12:35] ever and there's no human Creation in
[12:39] this world that can be attacked by China
[12:42] and United States and still go on as
[12:45] usual there's nothing there's no country
[12:47] there's no company there's no Army
[12:50] there's nothing that exists today except
[12:53] bit white that can say that that
[12:55] happened so I expect all Victory but
[12:58] after what they're going to do well it's
[13:00] going to depend on the number of people
[13:03] we orange spill like in Canada right now
[13:06] out of uh 40 million population there's
[13:09] about 8 million people that hold uh or
[13:12] or that held PTO okay and obviously we
[13:15] know that Bitcoin is not crypto and that
[13:17] crypto is coinery essentially so
[13:20] out of that 8 million let's say that
[13:21] maybe 5 million P Bitcoin and then on
[13:24] that five million how many do truly
[13:27] understand Bitcoin how many are there
[13:29] for the Deep purposes of Bitcoin not
[13:32] just to make a speculative game in fat
[13:34] and go in and go out you know so maybe 2
[13:38] million but that's still a lot of people
[13:40] and if you get to a Tipping Point where
[13:42] you have a sufficient people in a
[13:44] country then you can block those attacks
[13:47] but it can be evil what do I expect
[13:49] anything I expect people to be thrown in
[13:51] jail I expect property to try to be
[13:53] seized I expect laws to be passed that
[13:56] make that can make Bitcoin totally
[13:58] illegal you know they can try anything
[14:02] but will they succeed no they will fail
[14:05] because Bitcoin is also uh a revolution
[14:09] of Our Generation okay Boomer had their
[14:12] things the Boomer uh they they you know
[14:15] they they they they did the the the
[14:19] Breton Wood standard and these all
[14:21] things that they did to take the gold
[14:23] out but now we're coming with digital
[14:25] gold and this is our system as well so
[14:28] it's uh and and we're going to live
[14:30] longer you know boomers are going to
[14:31] retire So eventually we're going to win
[14:34] but until then I expect many more uh you
[14:37] know stuff to happen about Samurai well
[14:39] they were touting the state as well you
[14:41] know and you should do that you
[14:43] shouldn't T the state you you you
[14:45] shouldn't provoke the state because the
[14:47] state is powerful and you know the
[14:50] individuals they can be put in jail look
[14:53] at as what happened to him he was just
[14:55] saying the truth he was exposing uh
[14:57] Christ you know on civilians and he's
[15:00] still running in in in jail today so
[15:03] everybody should be careful and not you
[15:06] know town the state but at the same time
[15:09] should continue to push uh you know
[15:12] their vision of the future they want to
[15:14] build and as more people as we get the
[15:18] more countries that we unlock because
[15:21] now un salv El Salvador is basically
[15:24] unlocked well once we have a strong
[15:26] enough Coalition well then then there's
[15:29] nothing that can stop it and then
[15:31] everything can go on the bit white
[15:33] standard without the this uh this uh you
[15:36] know attacks on us I Lov also what you
[15:40] said before with uh fight for freedom
[15:43] and prosperity and and the liberty of of
[15:45] of the human being was that the initial
[15:47] reason you you came into the politics uh
[15:50] first and probably is now the reason
[15:52] that you in Bitcoin but this was this
[15:54] also the reason why you came in politics
[15:56] the first reason why I came in Canadian
[15:58] politics is to legalize weed because
[16:01] that was a promise in 2015 the why to
[16:04] legalize weed is not just because I want
[16:06] to get high more week you need to
[16:08] understand that in Canada before the
[16:09] legalization 90% of criminal uh cases
[16:14] were simple possession of marijuana so
[16:17] these were basically kids smoking a
[16:19] joint that went to jail that had their
[16:21] lives completely ruined that something
[16:23] became criminals afterwards because they
[16:26] they experienced the carceral system
[16:28] they couldn't Trav Trav to America they
[16:30] couldn't get a nice job afterwards
[16:32] because because they had a criminal
[16:34] record so I mean it was a disaster and
[16:36] imagine the lawyers the judges all the
[16:38] papers and everything that was uh going
[16:41] on and it literally put 8 billion dollar
[16:44] in the pockets of criminal every year
[16:46] and you know before we used to say you
[16:49] know marijuana is a gateway drop no it's
[16:52] not it's the dealer that's going to
[16:54] offer you other drugs if you go to the
[16:56] dealer to buy marijuana and the state
[16:59] was pushing the civilians to do business
[17:02] with criminals because they prohibited a
[17:05] product that was consumed by like 15
[17:08] million people in Canada and those
[17:10] people weren't going to stop smoking
[17:12] weed okay Canada is known for very good
[17:14] wheat and very strong wheat so that was
[17:18] my first reason to go into the politics
[17:20] and I had a you know a friend of M also
[17:23] that had some political Ambitions and we
[17:25] worked together and it was great and uh
[17:29] uh but that that was really the the the
[17:31] first reason but I I I always loved my
[17:34] fellow man I knew that if I I got in any
[17:37] position that uh inside the sector I was
[17:41] always going to work hard to help you
[17:43] know anybody that I can and that's what
[17:46] I did I helped a lot of people and I had
[17:49] a lot of fun I learned a lot of stuff uh
[17:52] as I told you I went around the country
[17:54] uh to you know to um to some uh meeting
[17:58] things where all ladies would tell us
[18:01] why would you feeling last week it's
[18:03] going to be terrible it's going to be
[18:04] the end of Canada as we know it and uh
[18:07] we did it today I mean you can just go
[18:09] into the store buy yourself a pre-roll
[18:11] joint there's Boomers in the line all
[18:14] people buying their THC oils so it's it
[18:18] was a great success so that's that's the
[18:20] main reason yeah it's it's it's it's at
[18:24] that point it's I think so clear why you
[18:27] have to legalize it uh there are so many
[18:29] studies like I think Portugal was a big
[18:31] study uh they showed how how they
[18:34] actually fight against drugs more uh
[18:38] effectively when they allowed those kind
[18:40] of trucks I don't know how I don't know
[18:43] if they're completely open or what they
[18:45] don't allow in Portugal uh but they kind
[18:48] of collected the tax money and tried to
[18:50] educate people uh with that tax money
[18:53] and this was like a complete Game
[18:54] Changer I feel like it's a um I mean
[18:57] this also brings us to a topic where
[18:59] like where do we see the the world going
[19:01] with politics in general like where
[19:03] where do we see when when Bitcoin is the
[19:06] sound money as a completely the
[19:09] fundamental of our basis of our human
[19:12] beings uh then we have forer States at
[19:16] least as I see it because they have to
[19:18] actually bring a service to uh the
[19:20] citizens to actually exist because if we
[19:24] have to pay taxes people will ask like
[19:26] oh why do I have to pay the taxes if if
[19:28] you can just inflate it out of their
[19:30] wallets nobody asks questions because
[19:32] their inflation is normal
[19:36] seemingly uh so uh what what what do you
[19:39] think will will this make uh as a world
[19:42] like as you also have the background in
[19:44] in politics what do you think will will
[19:46] Bitcoin in the long run especially like
[19:49] 5 10 20 50 years maybe even or maybe
[19:52] like 100 years um make with the world
[19:57] well first of all I don't think it's
[19:58] that long I think that we can safely
[20:00] talk about 10 years you know 10 years
[20:03] for me it seems like Bitcoin is going to
[20:05] gain a lot of maturity well what what I
[20:08] think is that uh with the resources that
[20:11] Bitcoin unlocks for bitcoiners every
[20:13] year every four years every 10 years
[20:16] we're going to get a lot of more uh
[20:18] spending power and then we're going to
[20:19] be able to do what we wish with that
[20:22] spending power uh some of us will plant
[20:24] Forest build beautiful homes help our
[20:27] fellow man do philanthropy but others
[20:30] are going to use those resources to fix
[20:32] our countries so how do I see it I see
[20:35] us winning and when you say the taxes
[20:38] are necessary well the taxes are
[20:40] basically a mirage because nobody pays
[20:43] enough taxes right now to fund the
[20:46] spending of the state they take the
[20:48] taxes obviously because they don't want
[20:50] a bigger hole but also because it's just
[20:54] a control method essentially the
[20:56] president of El Salvador he he said it
[20:58] well in his recent uh uh Speech is that
[21:03] they're spending money at a rate where
[21:06] taxes won't cover it and we're we're
[21:08] just getting in deeper and deeper and
[21:11] that how do I see the world the politics
[21:13] on the Bitcoin standard once we win well
[21:16] there there won't be no taxes because if
[21:18] the state the inflation also why the why
[21:22] is inflation 2% why was that the
[21:25] objective now it's 15% because they lost
[21:27] control uh stealing all all of these M
[21:30] all of this money but before it was 2%
[21:32] why was it 2% well it was 2% because you
[21:35] can steal 2% from the people without
[21:38] them noticing noticing it that much so
[21:42] it was that's the only reason is the
[21:44] ability to steal slowly but the
[21:46] inflation should be at 0% and people
[21:49] should pay zero taxes because the state
[21:52] should manage its resources in a
[21:55] responsible way where it it can grow its
[21:59] Prosperity without sucking it away from
[22:02] the people and after if the families are
[22:04] richer if the individuals are richer in
[22:07] a state well it's going to fix
[22:09] everything it's going to help the state
[22:11] become more prosperous because obviously
[22:13] rich people are going to do more
[22:15] philanthropy are going to get engaged
[22:17] you know they're they have the resour
[22:19] but what is going on right now is that
[22:22] the state is making us all poor and
[22:26] lowering our standard of living
[22:29] and it is it is making our countries
[22:31] look like third world countries right
[22:33] now because that's the direction where
[22:35] where it's pushing we have the system
[22:37] right now working against the citizen
[22:41] the the system does not represent the
[22:43] citizen no more it has been hijacked by
[22:46] by a lot of interest indirectly and
[22:49] directly once we fix that well then we
[22:52] can have a state that can create
[22:54] Prosperity without stealing it from its
[22:58] popul L because just imagine the energy
[23:01] that is produced every year in Canada
[23:03] there's much of that energy that is
[23:05] totally wasted during the time that it's
[23:08] not consumed well instead of being
[23:10] wasted if it was stored into Bitcoin
[23:13] imagine the prosperity could generate
[23:15] for the country I mean these are these
[23:17] are quantities of energies that are
[23:19] wasted that are mind bought and the
[23:22] waste is everywhere in every department
[23:25] and the government keeps going around
[23:27] choosing winners and losers giving
[23:30] billions to companies that don't need it
[23:32] corporation that buy back their own
[23:34] stocks that declare losses in Canada and
[23:37] declare profits elsewhere in the world
[23:39] that play these Financial games so I
[23:42] mean it's all R right now we have a a
[23:45] game that is rigged against us and once
[23:48] we fix the game and that this state once
[23:50] again starts to work for its CI
[23:53] citizenry there will be no need for
[23:56] taxes the and the state will will
[23:58] collect its revenue from another weights
[24:01] because if you create Prosperity if you
[24:03] create Innovation if you let the space
[24:06] for freedom to happen and for Market to
[24:09] operate Prosperity is going to be
[24:12] created everywhere and then the state is
[24:14] going to be able to to to get it and I'm
[24:17] not saying like the state should not
[24:19] take any fees anywhere no I'm just
[24:22] telling you that the personal taxes were
[24:25] put in place during World War II as a
[24:28] temporary measure okay to fund the war
[24:31] and when the war
[24:33] ended they kept the the the taxes on
[24:36] remue in Canada and the Next Generation
[24:39] they weren't informed and they just kept
[24:41] paying taxes you know and you need to
[24:44] understand something Robin once the
[24:46] government takes the Lynch from you it's
[24:48] not giving it back to you you need to
[24:50] take that inch back okay and the
[24:53] government is just going to keep and
[24:55] keep and keep on taking those inches
[24:58] because right now the system is R get us
[25:01] so and earlier when I tell you the
[25:03] system works I meant the system to get
[25:07] elected and take a part of the control
[25:10] of the system but right now we control
[25:13] very few uh positions of part there are
[25:17] very few good men that are there
[25:21] exclusively for the masses okay there
[25:24] are few of them there are few of them in
[25:26] Canada there are few of them in the in
[25:28] in in the United States the majority are
[25:32] there just because they want a job okay
[25:35] just because they want a job they don't
[25:37] want to offend too many people they want
[25:39] to get reelected so they have their
[25:41] little job okay and they will serve
[25:45] interests you know without knowing it
[25:48] too too much and without you know
[25:50] overthinking it and so it's it's truly a
[25:54] one party system that we have in Canada
[25:56] because they're playing ball together
[25:58] you know it's like I'm a left hand
[26:00] scratch right hand scratch a left right
[26:03] hand scratch so people when they tell me
[26:05] a p is coming Canada Trudeau is out
[26:08] because Trudeau is going to lose now the
[26:10] next election that's guarantee the
[26:11] numbers are awful he's out uh the
[26:15] ultimate date that shudo get dat power
[26:17] is October 2025 after that date before
[26:21] even we're going to have an election and
[26:23] he's going to be kicked out on his ass
[26:25] but the problem is the people coming in
[26:27] are the same people okay they're the
[26:30] same people it's just they play
[26:32] when you hear somebody tell you left
[26:34] versus right well that's mean she
[26:36] doesn't understand what the is
[26:37] going on there's no left versus right
[26:40] there's the government and the cronies
[26:43] around the government and there's us the
[26:45] people trying to make it in this world
[26:48] okay and we're having a very hard time
[26:51] making it since inflation is has made us
[26:54] 25% poorer in the last three years how
[26:58] how can you how can you work in that
[27:00] world you can't you're becoming poor and
[27:03] your St standard of living is dropping
[27:05] there is uh I had a the the offer of
[27:08] Bitcoin Nations on my my my podcast and
[27:11] he made the big statement that a
[27:13] democracy cannot work when the
[27:16] government is collecting taxes like as
[27:19] soon as they start collecting taxes the
[27:22] democracy is just uh years or decades
[27:25] away from falling apart because this is
[27:29] uh it it just does not work uh with with
[27:32] taxes and democracy itself it seems like
[27:35] that you also describing like uh the the
[27:37] justice system works like the're getting
[27:39] in and out and the Democracy itself but
[27:42] the the political system itself does not
[27:46] work like that's like for me like what I
[27:48] where I see the the differential between
[27:50] the what you described exactly because
[27:53] the systems are anchored in some uh you
[27:55] know in in in
[27:58] constitutional stuff that that is that
[28:01] has been operating and that that that
[28:03] functions but the problem is that every
[28:06] time you hear somebody say the politics
[28:08] I don't care about the PO this is what
[28:10] the the people in charge they want
[28:12] because it's less people to control to
[28:15] to to and they use propaganda they use
[28:18] money they they use all kinds of methods
[28:20] you know to to to get your vote the the
[28:23] real the the reality is the people have
[28:26] the power only one time only one time
[28:30] only during the election process when
[28:32] you think that valid and you put the X
[28:35] next to the name and you put it in that
[28:37] box that's the only time you have the
[28:38] power in in our
[28:40] Democrats you vote for somebody that you
[28:43] think that is going to have your
[28:45] interest at heart don't vote for a party
[28:47] don't vote because the other guy is
[28:49] worse don't just vote with your heart
[28:52] with somebody that you deeply think this
[28:55] person will try to do his best for the
[28:58] mes okay so that works but
[29:02] after I mean it has been now years where
[29:05] the same parties have held power that's
[29:08] in Canada and elsewhere in United States
[29:11] I mean the two-party system is a to
[29:13] Total illusion I mean these guys are the
[29:15] same insiders they talking to the same
[29:17] lobbies they're having the same lunch
[29:20] they're they're you know they're around
[29:22] the same crowd any system with time gets
[29:25] corrupted any system any organization
[29:28] with time gets corrupted so it's the
[29:31] same thing with the political system you
[29:33] know so what we need now is a fresh
[29:35] generation of people going into the
[29:38] politics and trying to do their best and
[29:40] saying no to the nonsense that they see
[29:44] exposing it talking about it attacking
[29:47] it and Bitcoin uh God willing is going
[29:51] to give them the financial resources to
[29:55] be there and be able to stand in the
[29:57] middle of up the store because you can't
[29:59] do that without being attacked without
[30:02] being smeared without being you know
[30:04] Point uh finger poting and say people
[30:07] are going to call you crazy because the
[30:09] masses have not uh weaken up yet to the
[30:12] fact many people know that things are
[30:15] wrong many people are suffering many
[30:18] people can't afford their groceries even
[30:20] today the groceries they they used to
[30:22] buy so they're going to buy some some
[30:24] cheaper stuff some less quality food but
[30:27] they don't know what why what what's
[30:29] going on because they're being lied to
[30:31] and also there's all of this propaganda
[30:33] machine that's brainwashing them
[30:36] constant so what we need to do is build
[30:39] our own machines to explain to the
[30:42] people what's going on and to have them
[30:44] to wor fill them and I want to remind
[30:46] you Robin as well that the American
[30:49] Revolution was only 3% of Patriots and
[30:53] the French Resistance was only 5% of the
[30:57] French and yet these two movements they
[30:59] want so we don't need to convince 100%
[31:02] of Canada or America or Europe we just
[31:05] need that 5% of Hardcore you know
[31:10] idealists that want to fix the system
[31:13] and it's going to it then it Cycles it's
[31:15] going to get fixed for a time and it
[31:17] might go to again and it's going to
[31:19] get fixed again I mean when you see
[31:21] history history is a big cycle of you
[31:24] know as we saw in memes that M bad good
[31:28] men create uh you know bad men create
[31:31] bad TI good men create good ti so that's
[31:34] what's going
[31:35] on it's it's it's fascinating for me to
[31:38] to see the political systems I mean this
[31:41] year is a special one because we have
[31:43] American elections we have European
[31:46] Union election in Austria election but
[31:48] yeah Austria is not that important for
[31:50] the general population of the world but
[31:52] I live in Austria I don't know maybe is
[31:54] in Canada also elections yeah it's going
[31:57] to be like I tell you it's the the end
[32:00] the the maximum date they can held it is
[32:02] in 2025 but I think it might be this
[32:05] other as well okay okay is it actually
[32:09] because you talked about there's a one
[32:11] party two party three- party system is
[32:13] it a healthy sign for a country when
[32:16] there are like four or five uh parties
[32:19] that all have around like 10 15 20% of
[32:23] of uh of of Voters or is it like uh even
[32:27] wor when there's like a lot of parties
[32:29] involved and it spread out a
[32:32] lot well I I think the more parties you
[32:35] have it's better for the system because
[32:37] it it
[32:39] decentralizes uh political power you
[32:42] know but the problem we have in Canada
[32:44] is that the parties are all Boomer
[32:47] parties and they align with some things
[32:49] that are complete nonsense so yeah we
[32:52] have a diversity of parties but are
[32:54] importing stuff like it created
[32:57] inflation
[32:58] and everything that surrounds it all of
[33:00] the parties in Canada cheered for the co
[33:03] spending and the co handouts and the co
[33:07] and and they all you know explained to
[33:09] us that it's okay there's not going to
[33:11] be inflation because they were just
[33:13] repeating points given to them by global
[33:17] lobing groups like McKenzie because it
[33:19] all comes from Washington not yet
[33:22] Washington is rolled okay the Empire
[33:25] that we live in now is the American
[33:27] Empire Washington is wrong why do I
[33:29] follow American politics why do I
[33:32] post to my American Patriots friends is
[33:34] because I understand that it all starts
[33:37] there okay so the whole Western reaction
[33:41] to the co situation which now we learn
[33:44] that was created by the Deep State and
[33:46] fouchi that went there and that fed it
[33:49] and all of these people should be put in
[33:51] jail because how many millions did they
[33:53] kill and what they did to the economy is
[33:56] a is a crime
[33:58] but like that's the that's that's the
[34:01] problem you know that that everybody
[34:03] agrees with these bullet point that that
[34:06] are being fed today and all of these
[34:09] parties yeah they're different parties
[34:11] have different logos and different
[34:12] people but they all agree on on these
[34:15] things and they all agree you know we
[34:17] should do as our as our allies and stuff
[34:19] like that but it's all I mean
[34:21] if your ally is wrong and propose
[34:23] something to like I can't believe that
[34:25] nobody these parties had econ IST take a
[34:28] look about this spending and say to the
[34:31] people listen if you take this $600
[34:34] check and if they send this money to all
[34:36] of these companies most that don't need
[34:39] it inflation is going to be this much
[34:42] you know nobody said that everybody was
[34:45] telling us stay uh you know let let's
[34:48] all stay together we're all together in
[34:51] this you know all of these propaganda
[34:53] point do it for your your neighbor you
[34:56] know take the shot for your
[34:58] neighbor we were completely brainwashed
[35:01] by everyone so after that happened I
[35:05] can't say that there's a many political
[35:08] party yeah there's the illusion of many
[35:10] political party but there's one big
[35:12] Boomer party in cada right now and it
[35:15] has become obsolete because it no longer
[35:18] represents the the the needs of the
[35:21] masses if you are listening to this
[35:23] podcast you might be wondering what is
[35:25] actually the setup look like of Robin or
[35:28] how can I improve my Bitcoin setup and
[35:30] there's two things you have to buy
[35:32] Bitcoin from the right source and you
[35:33] have to store Bitcoin the right way
[35:36] let's focus on the first thing how to
[35:38] buy Bitcoin it's simple have a Bitcoin
[35:40] only exchange don't deal with the
[35:42] shitcoin exchanges don't deal with an
[35:44] exchange that has an own token or
[35:46] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[35:48] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[35:51] for me the best partner for that and now
[35:55] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[35:57] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[35:59] a self custody solution where you
[36:02] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[36:05] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[36:08] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[36:11] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[36:13] phrase and you are better than 95% of
[36:17] all Bitcoin hodlers if you have more
[36:19] than ,000 in Bitcoin it's an absolutely
[36:22] must have one last thing before we get
[36:25] back to the video I'm really passionate
[36:27] about me other bitcoiners and there's an
[36:29] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[36:32] in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's
[36:35] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[36:38] conference in whole of Europe for all
[36:40] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[36:43] this place in June for all europees it's
[36:45] a must go anyways you're so close to the
[36:48] Bitcoin PR conference you basically have
[36:50] to come I will do interviews there and I
[36:53] would love to meet you all there use
[36:56] code Robin for all all my sponsors to
[36:58] get discounts and use the links down in
[37:01] the description fascinating for me to
[37:02] see also the time that we are living in
[37:04] as you described this what what's going
[37:06] on with Co what's going on in general
[37:08] with with the Bitcoin Revolution what's
[37:10] going on with the internet Revolution
[37:12] that is also like kind of just started
[37:14] out I mean it's a few decades old but uh
[37:17] it's it's not that old is there any and
[37:20] I know that you also begin in history is
[37:22] there anything uh then compares to to
[37:25] the time that we are living in and the
[37:27] time that
[37:28] might come in the next like few decades
[37:31] uh do you have any uh time in the
[37:34] history that kind of compares to what we
[37:36] are doing now yeah H there's many times
[37:39] in history and by the way you said you
[37:41] were Austrian I didn't know that I
[37:42] thought you were somewhere from
[37:44] Scandinavia I'm very happy to hear we
[37:46] were once in history in the same country
[37:48] bosia was part of the
[37:50] austro austr Hungarian Empire and
[37:53] there's many institution that were set
[37:55] up in Bosnia that are still in use to
[37:57] today the railway many of the railways
[38:00] that was built during the Austrian
[38:02] Empire is still the still in Us in
[38:05] Boston and it was modernized in many
[38:07] institutions as well political on
[38:10] Empires they grow and they disappear
[38:13] they they retract and they they go back
[38:16] the American Republic when it was
[38:19] created by the falling fathers they knew
[38:22] exactly what they were doing and they
[38:24] knew exactly the tyrany that they were
[38:26] fighting okay so they set up this
[38:29] Constitution that really gave a lot of
[38:31] power to the to the individuals when
[38:34] this Republic after the World War II
[38:37] became the Empire when it shifted from
[38:40] American Republic that cared about the
[38:42] Americans and that cared about the
[38:44] liberty and prosperity of the American
[38:47] people when that Republic became an
[38:49] Empire it started not giving a
[38:51] anymore about the Americans because now
[38:53] it became Global now the American Empire
[38:56] has centers in London has centers
[38:59] obviously in Washington DC and has
[39:01] centers uh you know uh in many other
[39:05] spots across the world as the the Empire
[39:08] and now the main focus of that Empire is
[39:11] no longer the leads of the American
[39:14] people so that's why I always like to
[39:17] tweet restore the Republic to my
[39:19] American Patriot friends because once
[39:22] they restored the Republic they can have
[39:24] people that care about it yes it
[39:26] happened a lot of time happen in ancient
[39:28] Ro where you know because it's a
[39:31] slippery slope you have the situation
[39:34] gets to a boiling point and then they
[39:36] start debasing money and once you start
[39:39] debasing money which now the American
[39:42] Empire is doing at at large scale at
[39:45] unprecedented scale I mean when you see
[39:47] these amounts these amounts are money
[39:49] bogling once this starts well it affects
[39:52] everybody because it affects even the
[39:55] stoes that work for the regimes because
[39:58] they're being paid in these monkey paper
[40:01] workless dollars and it happened in
[40:03] ancient TR where soldiers were being
[40:06] given coins that were still debased that
[40:09] the merchants would pay these coins no
[40:11] more and so after he starts all kinds of
[40:15] problems and turbulences and after he
[40:17] can can go inside of the he can become a
[40:20] total chaos and like in the ancient Ro
[40:23] you had massive migrations coming into
[40:26] the uh it Groll like that it's happening
[40:30] right now in America because right now
[40:32] in America in Washington DC you have
[40:34] people working actively
[40:37] against the Americans I mean the there
[40:41] was a a research that came out that said
[40:44] that there may be 20 million illegal
[40:47] citizens Living in America right now so
[40:50] imagine a country operating with 20
[40:52] million people that that have no stat
[40:55] status that you don't know what they are
[40:57] doing and how they are doing you can't
[41:00] have a society like that you know and
[41:02] these people are on the street what are
[41:04] they're going to do they're going to
[41:05] resort to cry okay because they want to
[41:08] eat they want to survive they they they
[41:10] that it's the the the ugly face of
[41:13] humanity that that comes out because
[41:16] people where you know when when you when
[41:18] you leave them with nothing well they're
[41:20] going to they've got to resort to awful
[41:23] things and you have the Biden
[41:25] Administration literally leaving the
[41:27] Border open sending police to attack
[41:30] peaceful protester students on
[41:32] University campuses that are protesting
[41:34] against an ongoing genocide but leaving
[41:38] an open border which is being exploited
[41:41] by cartels by Foreign intelligence
[41:44] Services uh ra islamist radicals and all
[41:48] kinds of Rivals to the American people
[41:51] are going in in Mass to this border why
[41:55] because as I told you earlier the no
[41:57] longer give a about the American
[41:59] populace in the matter of fact is they
[42:02] want to delute it they want to delute
[42:05] the American populace and they want to
[42:07] desire the American populace because
[42:10] they want to be able to grab even more
[42:13] power and already the power they have
[42:15] grabbed is not all power but it's
[42:19] getting close to because they have ways
[42:22] you know indirect ways to to to do
[42:25] basically any so you have things that
[42:27] are going on right now and people are
[42:29] starting to notice it you know there
[42:31] there are millions of people waking up
[42:33] to the fact that wait a minute maybe
[42:36] this government is not having my best
[42:39] interest at heart you know but they need
[42:42] to change it they need to reform they
[42:44] need to engage at every level and to
[42:47] fight for every office that they can
[42:50] they you know and that's why I'm very
[42:52] optimistic with uh about the future
[42:54] because the Bitcoin is making us s
[42:57] every year Bitcoin is giving us
[43:00] resources every year so if bitcoiners
[43:04] are smart enough they're going to get
[43:06] organized and they're going to push back
[43:08] and we're going to reclaim our our
[43:10] countries and we're going to build a
[43:11] better world and once we we do that well
[43:14] we're going to turn to the Stars we're
[43:16] going to Glo uh colonize our solar
[43:19] system we're going to advance in
[43:21] mathematics in research I mean listen
[43:24] Robert the era where we're living in you
[43:26] you you you said it earlier it's not
[43:28] only what you said with which I agree
[43:30] though it's also Quantum Computing AI
[43:35] Bitcoin the political turbulences the
[43:39] the whole world system right now is
[43:41] obsolete in the way it has it is
[43:44] operating right it's all obsolete we're
[43:46] at the same moment at history when the
[43:50] the French Revolution was starting to
[43:52] gain momentum and that everybody
[43:53] realized that absolute monarchies were
[43:56] obsolete
[43:57] nobody wants no no longer a a a king
[44:00] that Rules by the grace of God and that
[44:03] can do anything they want in the country
[44:05] people started saying wait I don't want
[44:07] that so the revolutions be uh started
[44:10] everywhere well now we're at the point
[44:12] in history where we have the the Empire
[44:15] debasing its money and people feeling
[44:18] that wait a minute these crooked
[44:21] politicians that work for lobbyist
[44:23] groups that start endless war and that
[44:27] push infinite inflation on us may not be
[44:30] the best thing for our our our interests
[44:33] you know so like everybody may you be in
[44:36] Austria may you be in Canada may you be
[44:38] America you realize that today so we're
[44:41] at that point we're at that Tipping
[44:43] Point and it can go anywhere is there
[44:45] like a global war on and freedom and
[44:47] like Bitcoin is the the one thing that
[44:50] is fighting back against this global war
[44:53] on freedom
[44:55] privacy uh on all those things that we
[44:57] have touched on yeah ah totally Bitcoin
[45:00] is our best resource because we're going
[45:03] to defund defund the central Bankers
[45:06] that print money from th air and you see
[45:08] you you in every country when you open
[45:10] the news you hear about the debt and the
[45:14] to who do we owe this money to who is
[45:16] the de they're going to say yeah well uh
[45:18] outside countries and you know some
[45:21] large businesses but in reality they're
[45:23] buying their own debt America right now
[45:26] is issuing more debt to help Japan with
[45:28] its debt and so it's all they're sucking
[45:32] their their own dick you know it's it's
[45:34] they're making more debt to pay for debt
[45:37] imagine you having a credit card that is
[45:40] bust busted and you just keep getting
[45:42] deeper in credit and you just your
[45:45] spending becomes more and more crazy you
[45:47] go to Dubai you go to prag you just like
[45:51] how how long can it go well it it the
[45:54] the show went on because the American
[45:58] dollar was at the center of the world
[46:00] system okay and when they do the did the
[46:03] bronwood courts with Nixon and they took
[46:06] the call out and they made it entirely
[46:08] based on the Trust on the on the
[46:10] American uh government essentially well
[46:14] since then it went to but now since
[46:17] the beginning of the Ukrainian War they
[46:19] have weaponized the dollar against
[46:22] Russia once you have the Americans
[46:24] seizing dollars that are Russia dollars
[46:27] in in America or elsewhere well why do
[46:30] you think that every other dictator
[46:32] anywhere in the world or any other
[46:34] regime that has money in the US dollar
[46:37] is think they're thinking listen if we
[46:39] don't drink the Kool-Aid that America
[46:41] wants us to drink they're just going to
[46:43] take our money so they're looking now to
[46:45] new ways to go so we see more and more
[46:48] countries that are no longer trading in
[46:50] the dollar and what I foresee for the
[46:53] future is the petrol B Bitcoin exchange
[46:58] because until now the the the the most
[47:00] important Corner storm of the dollar is
[47:03] the petrol dollar the deal that the the
[47:05] Americans made with the Saudis back then
[47:07] to have the petrol dollar and powered
[47:10] the dollar and made it a you know a
[47:12] central thing in the world now less and
[47:16] less countries want the dollar because
[47:18] they understand that first of all it's
[47:20] getting the based with inflation at a
[47:22] every year a faster uh scale and second
[47:26] if you don't agree with their decadent
[47:29] LGBT plus climate hulks they
[47:33] can just take your money away so why
[47:35] would any African countries hold their
[47:38] reserves in dollars you know now they
[47:40] are doing it because they have to but
[47:43] trust me everybody now is thinking about
[47:46] the other possibility and there is where
[47:49] Bitcoin becomes real important because
[47:52] Bitcoin is not left is not right is not
[47:55] pro Russia is not pro America is not uh
[47:59] anything it's just a ledger anchored in
[48:02] mathematics and physics the centralized
[48:05] with energy as it backb okay so these
[48:09] things any country any human can
[48:12] understand those things and we can agree
[48:14] with those things so that's why
[48:17] everything is going in and Bitcoin how I
[48:19] see it is like a black hole that open in
[48:23] this plane of life and this black hole
[48:26] is going to suck everything on because
[48:28] why W you have uh uh you know the the
[48:31] housing system based on bitcoin why
[48:33] won't you have the the healthare system
[48:35] based in bit why would you have the
[48:38] agricultural production based in bit why
[48:40] won't you like anything on the bit
[48:43] Bitcoin standard is better and it's
[48:45] going to create prosperity for the
[48:47] sector that adopts it so everybody's
[48:50] going to adop and the example I would
[48:53] give you in history is the folds you
[48:55] know at first when smartphones went out
[48:58] uh some people well everybody had the
[49:00] flip phones you know the Motorola phones
[49:02] the old phone I had one and one of my
[49:05] friends came and he was showing me his
[49:07] first Apple you know iPhone and I was
[49:10] like yeah sure it's not too bad but why
[49:12] do I need it I just want to make phone
[49:14] calls I'll keep my flip phone fast
[49:16] forward a few years everybody has a
[49:19] smartphone you yeah some ranchers
[49:21] somewhere still have their flip Falls
[49:23] you know some old oldtimers have their
[49:26] flip fall but but basically everybody
[49:28] has smartphones why because it's
[49:30] Superior
[49:32] technology it's as simple as that it's
[49:34] Superior technology and you have your
[49:37] Google Maps on it you have your Wallets
[49:40] on it now you can pay with it so Bitcoin
[49:42] is superior monetary
[49:45] technology so everybody is we it and
[49:49] 100% uh and I feel like um we at this
[49:52] point where we are getting closer and
[49:54] closer to this complete turnover of the
[49:58] Revolution do this complete like
[50:00] actually it's Bitcoin like we we agree
[50:02] on bitcoin right now it's not like that
[50:04] if you go on the streets and people ask
[50:06] you ask people oh what's the future of
[50:08] money I feel like only a handful of
[50:10] people will uh tell Bitcoin but at some
[50:13] point we come to this point we like oh
[50:15] what's your money or what's the what
[50:16] what do you see is the future of the
[50:18] money more and more people will say
[50:19] Bitcoin because they will get it uh
[50:21] intrinsicly even though they don't
[50:23] understand what blockchain is what what
[50:25] like how the lightning layer works or
[50:27] something like that they will not
[50:29] understand this in the same way that
[50:31] people also don't understand how uh the
[50:33] tcpb protocol works or how a WhatsApp
[50:36] message actually is sent uh I feel like
[50:38] only a really small portion of of people
[50:41] can really explain this in detail but
[50:43] they don't but they understand if they
[50:45] click on that button and they get that
[50:47] second tick then the other person gets
[50:49] it and that's what people uh will get
[50:52] about Bitcoin if I save in Bitcoin my
[50:55] purchasing power will go go up I will
[50:57] have more purchasing power in the future
[51:00] and this is what uh people uh will get
[51:02] more and more and also the freedom
[51:04] aspects of Bitcoin not only the monetary
[51:06] but all the freedom aspects did you
[51:08] heard about that Uncle that got locked
[51:10] out of the bank because he did that and
[51:12] that I thought he was a good guy why did
[51:14] he do that he's now Bitcoin because
[51:16] Bitcoin does not do such as you
[51:19] said yourself like it's it's it's uh it
[51:22] will be so apparent that Bitcoin uh is
[51:25] is this thing and as a bitcoiner always
[51:26] get this kind of a for more and like I
[51:29] have to buy a lot of Bitcoin now because
[51:31] tomorrow everybody will figure it out I
[51:33] feel like it it will take some time but
[51:36] um the the impossible question to ask
[51:39] now is like how long do you think can
[51:42] this old system this feat system live on
[51:45] like it's it's getting very long I feel
[51:47] like well you made some some important
[51:50] points and I want to tell you first of
[51:52] all bitcoiners like me and you just by
[51:55] existing and just by talking about
[51:57] Bitcoin there's many people that see us
[52:00] what we're doing you know friends
[52:02] neighbors people we know every year
[52:05] they're gonna you know
[52:06] what Yugo went to a vacation again with
[52:10] his whole family oh Yugo is driving you
[52:13] know a brand new Porsche Oh youu Canada
[52:15] just planted that Forest how the
[52:17] does youu Canada do that so we're we're
[52:21] doing it with an example first of all
[52:23] and second once Bitcoin party started to
[52:26] be be created and they will well it's
[52:28] going to be quite easy for them to win
[52:31] after the a few years because like in
[52:34] the you can go and say listen Bitcoin is
[52:37] worth let's say 70,000 today okay and
[52:41] you build a political platform on the
[52:43] 70,000 Bitcoin and then you don't get
[52:46] elected okay because people they they'd
[52:48] rather keep the whole part then you come
[52:51] back four years later you say Okay
[52:52] Bitcoin is now 200,000 uh here's another
[52:56] propos they're going to say oh wait he
[52:58] told us last time it was 70 now it's
[53:01] 200,000 no we're not ready he's still a
[53:04] crazy person okay four years later you
[53:06] you come you say okay now Bitcoin is
[53:08] worth 1 million here's the problem so
[53:10] it's all the numbers eventually people
[53:13] are going to say okay we should start to
[53:15] listen to these crazy crazy bitcoiner
[53:17] people since they seem to have endless
[53:21] buying power Meanwhile we're getting
[53:23] poorer and poor and yes the regime is
[53:26] going to do everything to discredit it
[53:28] and as they are doing now when Bitcoin
[53:31] drops 20% you have news articles all
[53:34] across the
[53:35] world exactly all time telling everybody
[53:38] Bitcoin drop 20% so when I have my
[53:41] Boomer friends in my lion club with who
[53:44] I do philantropy asked me hey Bitcoin
[53:46] dropped 20% I say yeah it can drop 20%
[53:50] 50% it can go up 50% it went up 100%
[53:53] this year it doesn't matter it is ballet
[53:56] but it's not risky and once you
[53:59] understand the difference between a
[54:01] volatility and a risk well then you
[54:03] understand Bitcoin and Bitcoin has no
[54:05] risk it has a lot of volatility so that
[54:09] thing we're going to get them slowly
[54:11] they're going to start noticing our
[54:13] successes and our optimism and Bitcoin
[54:16] is not just a monetary success bit
[54:19] Bitcoin realize you with everything it
[54:21] Reigns you with yourself because it
[54:24] gives you the freedom to do so it gives
[54:27] you the ability it Bitcoin is not about
[54:30] making money Bitcoin is about making
[54:33] money not via Factor anymore it's it's
[54:36] no longer a factor you you see a lot of
[54:39] these ogs in Bitcoin that have been
[54:41] there at many s cycles and that have
[54:43] been there since the first epops these
[54:46] people are rich so they can do what they
[54:48] want you have sailor that funded the
[54:51] Sailor Academy you have you know Max
[54:53] Kaiser and Stacy going around El
[54:55] Salvador
[54:56] uh changing the whole country helping
[54:59] people that were afflicted by crime uh
[55:02] gang crimes and stuff like that you can
[55:05] do whatever you want you can educate
[55:07] people or you can live in some isolated
[55:10] island so to go back to your question
[55:12] sure some people are going to just flee
[55:14] and go and live you know uh their little
[55:17] life somewhere but others like me and I
[55:19] hope many more with me are going to stay
[55:22] resist and use these resources that God
[55:26] has provided to us now to fix a better
[55:28] world I don't want to live in a
[55:30] beautiful castle and eat caviar and see
[55:33] from the top of my room people dying on
[55:35] the streets from hunger and you know
[55:37] from fentel and from all of these
[55:40] diseases they're pushing on us because
[55:43] we're getting poisoned by our food by
[55:45] our water and we're being light to so
[55:48] like we need to fix all of that and once
[55:51] we fix all of that we're going to truly
[55:53] unlock the human potential and we're
[55:56] going to truly H you know lead our T man
[56:00] and that's what we do baters in my
[56:02] opinion need to be leaders because if
[56:05] you are a bitcoiner today something
[56:08] happened in your life that led you to
[56:10] bitcoin and if you deeply understand
[56:12] Bitcoin today that means that you have
[56:14] realigned yourself enough to understand
[56:17] some deep truths and once you understand
[56:19] those deep troths well I think it would
[56:22] be very bad to just keep them to your
[56:26] yourself and isolate yourself and live
[56:29] at the Ivory Tower as the current Elites
[56:32] are doing you know do we want to be like
[56:35] them or do we want to be better and I
[56:38] know I want to be better and I know I
[56:40] want to to push truth in everything
[56:43] truth in agriculture truth in medicine
[56:46] truth in in weather truth in in
[56:49] everything because I believe in science
[56:51] okay and science is not what they tell
[56:54] you right now that the science is
[56:55] because there's a scientific consensus
[56:57] there's not no such thing as a scient
[56:59] scientific consensus nobody gives a
[57:02] about a scientific consensus you know
[57:04] they were cutting heads in the
[57:05] Renaissance period because somebody
[57:08] understood some deep scientific things
[57:10] that didn't match with the scientific
[57:12] consensus at the time okay that today we
[57:15] look and we say yeah okay in the
[57:17] medieval time when they were trowing
[57:19] their through the windows in the
[57:21] street somebody probably said hey maybe
[57:23] it's not a good thing to throw in
[57:25] the street it can CA plates you know and
[57:27] he was probably burned at the state for
[57:29] not agreeing with the scientific
[57:31] consensus at the time and right now
[57:34] we're at the same time every step in
[57:36] human history we see to think that we're
[57:39] in the modern age but we're still
[57:41] throwing through the windows we're
[57:43] still doing some nonsense that we're
[57:45] going to look a 100 years from now and
[57:48] say oh my God we're we were so so stupid
[57:51] to do that that was hurting us so much
[57:53] Bitcoin is going to fix everything and
[57:56] now we're at such an early stage that
[57:59] it's very difficult to understand and
[58:01] most people are gonna just come in for
[58:04] the three I had my lion Fred the other
[58:06] day tell me hey man uh thank you for
[58:09] telling me about the Bitcoin I made 20%
[58:12] profit on it and so he bought it he made
[58:14] 20% and he sold it and I was like bro
[58:17] this is don't tell me that I need to
[58:19] orange bill you once again I'm gonna
[58:21] orange F once again because why would
[58:23] you do that you had those that money
[58:25] that you bought
[58:26] it was working for you while you were
[58:29] sleeping you had your small Bitcoin sat
[58:31] soldiers going out there and generating
[58:34] purchasing power to you while you sleep
[58:36] and that's the best investment because
[58:38] the rest that you can buy with your
[58:40] money if it's property if it's stocks if
[58:44] it's a company or something there's a
[58:47] judge somewhere that can sign a piece of
[58:49] paper you never heard about these people
[58:52] and they're going to seize everything
[58:54] that you owe for whatever reason it may
[58:58] be for something that you said that they
[58:59] don't agree that they're going to label
[59:01] as hate speech or whatever Bitcoin
[59:04] nobody can seize it it's yours it's
[59:07] working for you and your succession it's
[59:10] working for your benefits forever
[59:13] forever the only and and and after
[59:16] everybody's trying to do something you
[59:18] know you have these rou te these uh you
[59:21] know Financial gurus giving HS Bitcoin
[59:24] you need to do nothing you buy it you
[59:27] sit on it and then you wait and you
[59:31] decide once the the moment is right what
[59:35] strong action do you want to do and if
[59:37] you were poor and you decide that you
[59:39] want to buy yourself a nice house and to
[59:42] buy your mama a nice house well you can
[59:44] do that if you you care about nature you
[59:47] want to plant a forest you can do that
[59:50] so you need to do absolutely nothing
[59:53] except stack stats and try to live on
[59:56] the Bitcoin standard that that's my role
[59:58] I'm not there yet I want to get there as
[60:01] soon as possible there were a lot of
[60:02] interesting points in there like first
[60:04] of all I think as you said at the
[60:06] beginning uh it's so true that we are
[60:08] the signal like when we succeed in life
[60:11] and we are happy and fulfilled and we
[60:14] also have a lot of success in life
[60:16] neighbors uh acquaintances everybody
[60:18] will notice that so in that way we are
[60:21] the signal in all of the noise that is
[60:23] around us uh feel also like uh we we
[60:26] should start political parties in in the
[60:28] contest that we're in and and educate
[60:30] for some money and freedom we we are
[60:34] human notes we are human notes in the
[60:38] human
[60:40] uh Block Chain okay in in the human not
[60:44] Network where notes and then everything
[60:47] yeah I I love it it's also like the
[60:49] first Revolution and I'm not that good
[60:51] in in history maybe you can correct me
[60:53] on that but I feel like it's the first
[60:54] Revolution when you take part in it you
[60:56] actually gain financially from it you
[60:58] don't have to pay for that Revolution
[61:00] you actually have to have you actually
[61:02] gain from it uh usually when you're are
[61:04] acting in the revolution you're uh going
[61:07] against the forces you have to spend a
[61:09] lot of resources to do that in in the
[61:13] Bitcoin Revolution you actually gain
[61:15] resources while you're participating in
[61:18] a revolution am I correct was there
[61:20] something similar in in history no it's
[61:23] that you're totally correct and I would
[61:25] like to remind your Auditors that uh
[61:28] your listeners that the the American
[61:30] framers the American revolutionaries
[61:33] paid a de price for what they did and
[61:35] the freedom they gave to their people
[61:37] many were had their property seized and
[61:40] many died in poverty they they were so
[61:44] when you participated in the revolution
[61:46] you paid a dire
[61:49] price Financial price and personal price
[61:52] uh you know your family and stuff like
[61:54] that so yeah you're right this is the
[61:56] first Revolution where we're getting
[61:59] rewarded participate in because it's a
[62:01] whole new system Bitcoin actually is uh
[62:06] all it's our Digital World touching for
[62:09] the first time you know that famous
[62:12] painting uh touching the physical plane
[62:15] of life okay so that's what Bitcoin is
[62:17] so where're how I see it is like it you
[62:20] know that sand plot has been reversed
[62:23] and now the grains of wealth are
[62:26] dropping into Bitcoin gray by gray but
[62:29] it has been reversed the whole grade of
[62:31] sand are going to go down into the
[62:33] Bitcoin Network it's just a matter of
[62:35] time and the more that the sand Lees
[62:38] well the more sand is going to leave
[62:41] because like I'm telling you there's
[62:43] bigger holes being made in the fire
[62:45] system that they need to fill those
[62:47] holes with printing more fire and when
[62:50] they print more fire fire they
[62:52] destabilize more things and more people
[62:54] are going to look for Alternatives and
[62:57] so if we have successful bitcoiners that
[62:59] are operating successful Bitcoin
[63:01] companies and successful Bitcoin
[63:04] movements and so just talking about
[63:06] Bitcoin like what we're doing right now
[63:08] is a very important and Powerful things
[63:11] words are more powerful than bullets
[63:14] because these words that we exchang
[63:16] today may be heard by somebody that may
[63:19] do something else and it might be heard
[63:21] by millions of people eventually and
[63:24] among those Millions another people can
[63:27] understand some things said in another
[63:29] way that another person can understand
[63:31] so it spreads words are are are like a
[63:34] virus so that's why parrant through
[63:36] histories have always tried to silence
[63:38] us and today with the actual technology
[63:42] you can silence it and what is bitcoin
[63:44] is that it's information you can silence
[63:47] somebody from remembering his SE words
[63:51] this you you can memorize it and you can
[63:53] work walk around with millions in your
[63:55] account just by remembering those words
[63:58] and imagine how powerful that is you can
[64:00] leave countries go to another country
[64:02] push a revolution there or build a hotel
[64:06] there whatever you want to do so it's a
[64:08] it's a great power and Bitcoin you're
[64:10] right is the first time because yeah
[64:13] there were other re Revolution once the
[64:15] revolutionaries they get in power they
[64:17] start to pillage and exploit the people
[64:19] to make themsel Rich the Bolsheviks what
[64:22] they did in Russia I mean they created a
[64:24] whole new class
[64:26] of oppressors and they were more extreme
[64:29] that they know than than the t was in
[64:33] many aspects but they were the answer to
[64:36] the absolute monarch monarchies that
[64:39] were in place and that were oppressing
[64:40] people for thousands of years Bitcoin
[64:44] there's no need for that there's no need
[64:46] to pillage and to burn everything once
[64:49] you get it power you Bitcoin realigns it
[64:53] and so there's a big difference between
[64:54] destroying and rebuilding and realign it
[64:57] I don't want to burn the whole society
[64:59] down as I told you earlier there's many
[65:02] things that are functional in our
[65:03] systems we need to keep the good and to
[65:06] rely the bad so that's how I see and I
[65:10] feel like we can even now see the the
[65:13] beginnings of that when we look at
[65:15] places like El Salvador when we look at
[65:18] uh small places like even lug in Swiss
[65:20] when we look at uh even like small
[65:22] communities or individual people that
[65:24] adopted Bitcoin how that can change and
[65:26] how can that better their lives and
[65:28] better the circumstances you were also
[65:30] in in in Salvador with the the Haring
[65:32] party uh I I think right yeah I was
[65:36] there with the 600 big most popular bits
[65:39] if you were there you you you're not
[65:41] popular enough no I did but no there was
[65:44] OG's there I mean Stacy Herbert she's
[65:47] such a warrior Queen uh we heard
[65:49] anecdotes about her uh when they raised
[65:52] some money about um they raised some
[65:54] money to help families that were
[65:56] affected by crime uh crime they went
[66:00] there to the you know the tough
[66:02] neighborhood Distributing money uh to
[66:06] these people Max Kaiser was there uh the
[66:09] OG the the the the the poster by
[66:12] Excellence the the ship poster profet as
[66:15] I called him was there uh but the Eric
[66:19] Stacks I mean many other people were
[66:21] there Roger 9000 played music for us I
[66:24] don't know if you saw what I posted it
[66:26] and so the energy there was amazing and
[66:30] that's why I wanted I'm going to go to
[66:31] the Montreal Conference next week and I
[66:34] might also go to cack now that you have
[66:36] the hyped it for me and I want
[66:38] eventually I want to do do them all I
[66:40] want to do the circuit you know I want
[66:41] to go around talk to people because when
[66:43] you around those people you have this
[66:45] energy you know you you you walk out of
[66:48] there uh completely hyped about what's
[66:51] going on and you see you see the people
[66:53] you talk you you see some other angles
[66:56] that you couldn't maybe see before and
[66:58] obviously we were in the a five star
[67:01] hotel with beaches with unlimited
[67:04] cocktails and uh you know bouet food so
[67:08] we uh we really enjoyed it I I yeah it
[67:13] was
[67:13] amazing I love it I love it and I can
[67:16] only recommend to everybody to go to
[67:17] bitcoin prag uh and to go to the Bitcoin
[67:20] conferences in general like uh maybe
[67:22] Bitcoin brag is far away because you're
[67:23] in America then there's like Nashville
[67:25] there's so many other uh Bitcoin
[67:27] conferences I always hype Bitcoin BR
[67:29] because it's really close to me uh it's
[67:32] I feel like I think three hours I need
[67:35] there with train and car and everything
[67:37] uh three hours around that time I need
[67:39] there but there are a lot of great
[67:41] Bitcoin conferences in this in this
[67:43] world and and I just encourage people to
[67:45] go somewhere Bitcoin is obviously good
[67:48] because there are so many people uh and
[67:51] and uh I love the the feeling there but
[67:54] you can get in any Bitcoin conference
[67:56] and even if you don't want to get to a
[67:57] Bitcoin conference just go to a Meetup
[68:00] like there are usually local meetups
[68:02] with like 20 people 10 people just go
[68:04] there and then feel like the the r there
[68:07] and it's it's it's it's it's great it's
[68:08] like see bitcoiners in real life that's
[68:11] that's the life go go meet them the the
[68:16] the main thing that I got out of the
[68:18] Halloway party is love love was the
[68:23] first thing there
[68:26] everybody was spreading Lu and that's
[68:28] why what what is really fun in the
[68:30] Bitcoin is that we're not in competition
[68:32] against each other you know like it's
[68:34] some Finance uh circles where
[68:37] everybody's trying to outperform the
[68:38] other we're at competition with our old
[68:42] self we're at competition with our
[68:44] mindset how deep are we in this Bitcoin
[68:47] rabbit F and when you see other
[68:49] bitcoiners that are deeper than you and
[68:51] that tell you some deep truths well that
[68:54] that can only realign you with help you
[68:57] become a better person and then when you
[68:59] see these amazing creators in the
[69:01] Bitcoin space that create music I mean
[69:04] there there there was this amazing uh
[69:06] rapper that uh that that that was there
[69:09] uh this Asian girl that the does a great
[69:13] song called time time chain and others I
[69:17] mean it was my the love and the optimism
[69:21] of there was really something and
[69:23] everybody noticed it like there was
[69:25] people there working the hotel because
[69:27] yeah El Salvador has legalized Bitcoin
[69:30] as a as a legal tender and but I mean
[69:33] there's a lot of people to orang kill in
[69:35] El i i i i orange kill maybe 15 people
[69:38] in El uh Uber drivers waiters business
[69:43] owners like I'm like why aren't you
[69:45] doing people are still you know they're
[69:47] cautious they think that because that
[69:49] they don't have enough money and then
[69:51] when when I tell them Bitcoin is not for
[69:53] the rich it's not for the poor it's for
[69:56] if you can stack $10 of Bitcoin by month
[69:59] do it do it with that $10 you're
[70:01] building a better future for you and
[70:03] your family because that $10 that you
[70:05] put that month is going to work for you
[70:07] forever it's going to generate buy Power
[70:10] for you forever if you keep that $10
[70:13] under your mattress in five six years
[70:15] you won't even be able to buy a a
[70:18] McDonald's because the inflation is
[70:20] going out of
[70:22] control yeah 100% And I would really
[70:25] love it so much and I overlooked a
[70:27] little bit of time usually I go around
[70:29] one hour we over shooting the time today
[70:31] I love it um I still have before we go
[70:34] to our end routine one more question
[70:36] that I try to get integrated in every
[70:39] podcast nowadays what are you currently
[70:41] extremely passionate about that we did
[70:44] not touch on in the podcast like outside
[70:46] of Bitcoin outside of History politics
[70:49] everything that we touched on is there
[70:50] anything that you're currently extremely
[70:52] passionate about
[70:55] what I'm passionate about crony other
[70:57] than Bitcoin and uh well I'm just
[71:00] passionate about the truth I think that
[71:03] the uh everybody needs to speak their
[71:06] own mind even if it makes no sense even
[71:09] if we're wrong I'm wrong I'm wrong on
[71:11] many things okay we're all wrong we're
[71:14] all uh flaw and uh for me the thing that
[71:18] I'm most passionate about and this is
[71:21] even more than than Bitcoin and anything
[71:23] is God okay because God Bitcoin realigns
[71:28] us with God as well Bitcoin is
[71:30] mathematical truth that we discover and
[71:33] Truth leads to God for me God is our
[71:38] whole Western societies were were built
[71:40] on God okay the fact that you respect
[71:43] other human life the fact that we you
[71:46] know we do so many things that were
[71:48] there because of this purpose that that
[71:51] initial purpose that's what I'm
[71:52] passionate about and that's why I should
[71:54] post a lot and sometimes are B
[71:56] things that will make people
[71:58] uncomfortable but I don't care if people
[72:00] don't agree with me they can go
[72:03] themselves and I say that with with love
[72:05] I love everybody we can disagree but
[72:08] don't come to me and tell me what I can
[72:10] or cannot say what I can and cannot
[72:13] think because these freedoms to me were
[72:16] god- give it and I'm going to respect
[72:18] him by I'm going to honor honor him by
[72:23] standing my ground and saying the truth
[72:25] as I see it not the truth that somebody
[72:28] else is pushing on me and like uh please
[72:32] please this or that I don't care I I'll
[72:35] never do personal attacks except on like
[72:38]  evil villains that are pushing
[72:40] evil on us but in general I hate
[72:42] nobody I hate truly nobody but I think
[72:45] that there's a lot of going
[72:47] on and most of it is still going on
[72:50] because people are not courageous enough
[72:52] to denounce the falsehoods on which
[72:55] these fuckeries are paced okay if
[72:57] you see something that is wrong if you
[73:00] see something that makes no sense first
[73:02] step is to say this thing makes no sense
[73:06] for an alcoholic the first step is to
[73:08] accept that he's an alcoholic before he
[73:11] can help himself well now as a society
[73:14] we we've stayed so far away from God
[73:17] that the first step is to say listen
[73:19] there's some evil forces around
[73:22] us doing some evil okay and
[73:26] everybody needs to see this PL the veil
[73:28] Is Lifting and it's lifting on
[73:31] everything and that's why things seem so
[73:34] vulgar and so stupid and so obsolete
[73:37] today is because we're seeing finally
[73:40] the things as they truly are and that
[73:42] there's Bitcoin is going to help us
[73:45] realign with with God so that's what I'm
[73:47] really passionate about but I don't and
[73:51] I just want to say something and I want
[73:53] to criticize Max sker Bitcoin is not God
[73:57] Bitcoin is a tool it has Divine in it it
[74:00] has Divine in it because it has truth in
[74:02] it and it has peace in it and it has
[74:05] prosperity in it so it has God in it but
[74:08] it's not God okay God created things
[74:10] much more complicated that bitco he
[74:12] created the Galaxy he he he created the
[74:15] infinite Universe let's not uh we're
[74:19] nothing humans we're we're just living
[74:21] on the top of this one planet we have
[74:23] big egos we think we can affect the you
[74:26] know the the climate and affect but the
[74:28] TR the reality is we can have a solar
[74:31] flame uh flare destroy us completely we
[74:34] can have a last destroy us completely we
[74:36] can have a superv candle destroy us
[74:38] completely we ain't we're still
[74:41] nothing trying to become something okay
[74:45] and Bitcoin is going to be a powerful
[74:47] tool with that but we need after that
[74:51] once we we reach a point where Bitcoin
[74:53] has it powered us not to go into a uh
[74:57] some kind of a weird Bitcoin is God you
[75:00] know Cults Bitcoin is a tool the same
[75:03] way fire when we invited fire it became
[75:07] a powerful tool well Bitcoin is a tool
[75:10] and I want to end with
[75:12] this Jesus put fire to the world and
[75:16] Bitcoin is the kerosine is going to burn
[75:19] the whole God that
[75:21] thing I love that so much perfect then
[75:24] uh can uh and I don't don't I don't even
[75:27] want to uh uh put anything additional on
[75:30] that because this was just in itself
[75:32] perfect and I love it uh I will put it
[75:35] probably in the in the trailer in the
[75:36] beginning of the episode let's see how
[75:38] how it how it goes for the endro we have
[75:40] something really cool we have like kind
[75:42] of a blockchain thing where the previous
[75:44] guest is asking a question for the next
[75:45] guest so that like all the episodes are
[75:47] kind of like connected with the guests
[75:49] to each other uh this is the one
[75:51] question that I don't is not coming from
[75:54] me but it's coming from someone else uh
[75:57] the question for you is like do you have
[75:58] an exit plan for
[76:01] Bitcoin uh no I'm gonna I'm going to
[76:04] burn with Bitcoin if Bitcoin goes to
[76:07] minus $100 I'm still going to stack sets
[76:10] if Bitcoin makes me poor every year I'm
[76:12] still going to stack that and I'm going
[76:14] to try to work hard to rehabilitate the
[76:16] system because Bitcoin is not just a
[76:18] system Bitcoin is also an idea and ideas
[76:21] are more powerful than any system
[76:23] because ideas can always you know be
[76:27] used to better the system and Bitcoin is
[76:30] a living code Bitcoin can be hijacked
[76:33] like it doesn't mean that if it hadn't
[76:35] been destroyed until now that it can be
[76:38] destroyed we don't know but what we know
[76:40] is that the idea and the the the the the
[76:44] the values of Bitcoin now are deeply
[76:47] entrenched into our brains so no I'm
[76:50] going down with Bitcoin I'm going to be
[76:51] like the pest on the Titanic still
[76:53] playing while the ship sinks I'm going
[76:55] to be that we we are willing to die on
[76:59] on on on this sale I love it before
[77:01] before we close before I let you go uh
[77:03] where can people find you and ask you
[77:05] questions like uh is is there the the
[77:07] best way to reach out to you anywhere uh
[77:10] I'm on X so you can reach me with the
[77:12] handle 0 to one Bitcoin so 0er and one
[77:16] are numbers 0 to one Bitcoin that's my
