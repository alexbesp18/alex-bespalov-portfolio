[00:00] I can really imagine that we will see $1
[00:01] million next year with all this demand
[00:04] lining up coming to this small amount of
[00:06] Bitcoin left Bitcoin mining is a perfect
[00:08] fit for all the challenges that we are
[00:10] waiting here for you know in Europe now
[00:12] we see the Swiss Parliament introducing
[00:15] a bill for a strategic Bitcoin Reserve
[00:17] OTC desks they cont trct the volume that
[00:20] they have from China and it has been
[00:23] tripling since 2021 Bitcoin is only
[00:26] going up not just in price but also in
[00:28] adoption in businesses that are evolving
[00:31] in jobs that are being created so I
[00:33] think there will be a lot of chances to
[00:35] get a foot into this industry it would
[00:37] be good if we can onboard as much people
[00:39] as possible before all the Bitcoin going
[00:41] into big
[00:43] [Music]
[00:47] institutions it's really interesting uh
[00:49] to talk about Bitcoin mining energy and
[00:52] especially in Europe uh I think
[00:54] currently the most mining is going on in
[00:57] uh in in America if if I'm uh I'm not
[01:00] mistaken ever since uh China exited
[01:04] it how would you say is the current land
[01:08] skp of Bitcoin mining uh maybe with a
[01:10] little bit of focus of of Europe but
[01:12] also like in general how would you
[01:14] describe it right now yeah so I think
[01:17] everybody just remembers in 2021 or at
[01:21] least everybody who's in the space for a
[01:23] couple of years we remembers the Bitcoin
[01:26] mining ban in China in
[01:28] 2021 so
[01:30] if you look at the hash rate chart go on
[01:33] the global hash rate chart you can see
[01:35] this um downtrend during these months
[01:39] and since then I have to say that the
[01:40] mining landscape has pretty changed you
[01:42] already mentioned Robin that um us is
[01:45] supposed to be the biggest minus of
[01:47] course we can't say for sure where all
[01:49] the hash rate is coming from but um as
[01:53] data show right now and also
[01:55] regulational wise we think that us is
[01:58] definitely the biggest minor with
[02:00] approximately 20 up to 40% of the hash
[02:03] rate coming out of the US um especially
[02:05] Texas or west Texas is a mining Hub um
[02:09] this has to do with the fact that aircut
[02:12] the local grid operator in Texas has
[02:15] embraced the Comm Mining and is using
[02:16] Bitcoin mining as a tool for um for
[02:19] demand response which basically means if
[02:21] a lot of energy is in the grid miners
[02:24] can scale on their operations and if two
[02:27] less energies available in the grid
[02:29] miners sh of the operations and get paid
[02:31] for it and now with Donald Trump in in
[02:35] in as elected designated President we
[02:38] see that um miners are getting more
[02:40] bullish on uh in the US um but we also
[02:43] see a lot of different countries
[02:46] evolving in the Bitcoin mining industry
[02:49] um I think everybody that has been yeah
[02:52] researching mining a little bit has um
[02:55] has heard about Ethiopia um Ethiopia has
[02:58] a big Dam right now um where they
[03:01] produce a lot of overc capacities um so
[03:05] a lot of our customers at terahash are
[03:07] actually um considering investing into
[03:10] Ethiopia um my
[03:13] personal opinion about Ethiopia is a
[03:15] little bit I would say it's a two-sided
[03:18] metal so um so saying um because you
[03:22] have infrastructural problems there I
[03:24] mean basically what you need as a minor
[03:26] is internet and electricity right and we
[03:29] all know that um but I mean don't get me
[03:34] wrong the electricity is there in
[03:35] Ethiopia um but the infrastructure so
[03:39] the the flow of the electricity is not
[03:42] that easy there this these are
[03:44] infrastructural problems like you know
[03:46] um outages um maybe internet is not
[03:49] working so I personally consider it
[03:53] consider it's still a not perfect um
[03:56] mining environment but it's evolving as
[03:58] electricity is also pretty cheap we had
[04:01] Paraguay before in South America um
[04:05] which is basically or was a mining Hub
[04:07] and is still kind of a mining up um but
[04:10] what happened is basically that um the
[04:12] local grid operator um increased
[04:15] electricity prices about 15% which made
[04:19] the mining business already not
[04:20] profitable for for for many operations
[04:23] so they all moved over to Ethiopia some
[04:26] went to Brazil um I heard that Argentina
[04:29] evolving um as well right now they just
[04:32] recently opened up um their their doors
[04:35] for AI data centers and of course as
[04:38] well for Bitcoin under
[04:40] melee and yeah now of course um Europe
[04:44] Europe is a special case for mining as
[04:46] normally the mining industry always
[04:48] worked like yeah just plug in your Min
[04:50] and through the wall plug and start
[04:52] mining if you got cheap electricity
[04:55] right um but here in Europe we have
[04:57] other circumstances our electricity is
[04:59] known to be higher so me personally and
[05:03] I'm sitting next to Munich right now
[05:05] just for for the audiences to to know
[05:08] that and I pay between 30 and 40 cents
[05:12] Euro cents per kilowatt hour I don't
[05:14] know what about you in Austria and next
[05:16] to Vienna I think is almost the same
[05:18] right maybe 25 um to 35 cents per
[05:21] kilowatt hour which makes mining highly
[05:24] unprofitable you can't set up a
[05:25] operation a mining operation with these
[05:28] costs and so we have to come up with
[05:30] other Solutions here right um and you
[05:33] probably have seen um that we have these
[05:37] integrated or we are promoting these
[05:38] integrated mining Solutions um where we
[05:41] basically are not Solly mining with the
[05:44] miners but also reusing the heat that
[05:47] are produced by the Bitcoin Miners And
[05:50] if possible we are also participating in
[05:52] demand response programs like um I
[05:54] mentioned before in Texas where we get
[05:56] paid for shutting down our
[05:58] operations and this whole concept is
[06:01] pretty new um what do I mean by that I
[06:04] mean um a Time Horizon of three to four
[06:08] years probably when all the narratives
[06:10] came up and now we are pretty happy that
[06:13] we see first um facilities evolving here
[06:16] in Germany um where our Focus lies of
[06:19] course um but also in other European
[06:21] countries for instance we just launched
[06:23] our our newest project in Finland our
[06:26] Genesis site where we are now heating a
[06:28] whole city um with the waste heat of our
[06:31] bitco mining operation and there we are
[06:34] working with the Local District heating
[06:36] company to do that and yeah to just give
[06:40] a quick outlook on the future of Bitcoin
[06:42] mining in Europe I think there is no
[06:44] other way than integrating it um into
[06:47] our grids into our energy infrastructure
[06:50] into the existing energy infrastructure
[06:52] but I think Bitcoin mining is a perfect
[06:55] fit for all the challenges that we are
[06:57] waiting here for you know in Europe and
[07:00] I can personally imagine that yeah you
[07:04] know the Europeans the Germans the
[07:06] engineers um that they find pretty
[07:09] pretty good use cases for for Bitcoin
[07:11] mining as we are providing flexibility
[07:15] right this is basically our service we
[07:16] are providing flexibility and switching
[07:18] on and switching off our our Miners And
[07:22] I think there will be a lot of demand
[07:23] for that in the future so I'm personally
[07:26] really bullish on Europe I consider it
[07:28] the safest envir environment for
[07:31] mining um regulational Wise
[07:34] infrastructural Wise um the point is now
[07:38] many Watchers of us probably will say oh
[07:41] wow how can somebody say that Europe is
[07:43] going to be the best place for mining
[07:46] yes I agree we had this kind of um green
[07:49] and left politics before in the EU
[07:53] Parliament but all of this changed um in
[07:56] the last um EU elections we had a slight
[07:59] right shift in the EU elections and they
[08:02] basically really don't care about you
[08:05] know all this narrative about oh Bitcoin
[08:08] wastes too much too much energy Bitcoin
[08:11] is money just for drug dealers and Sil
[08:13] Road users and all this the narratives
[08:16] they are outdated and basically they are
[08:19] following a more I would say less a fair
[08:22] approach which basically means that we
[08:24] are not having any any fears or doubts
[08:28] about um
[08:30] yeah a anti- Bitcoin regulation or anti-
[08:33] Bitcoin mining regulation and on the
[08:35] meantime we installed or at least my
[08:38] colleague Rachel um where I'm streaming
[08:40] this podcast out of her office right now
[08:43] as you maybe can see founder of lim
[08:44] Ranch and also um founding member of um
[08:49] ibia the European Bitcoin energy
[08:51] Association um which allows us basically
[08:55] to do work in Brussels um to be on the
[08:58] table with the related entities to
[09:01] advocate for a positive Bitcoin mining
[09:03] regulation in Europe that's interesting
[09:06] that
[09:07] uh uh you consider Europe to be safer uh
[09:11] than the US for uh Bitcoin mining
[09:14] especially now with the Trump coming
[09:15] into the scene and and and saying oh
[09:17] let's M all the Bitcoin in In America
[09:19] which obviously is absurd but uh it's
[09:21] kind of the saying like we we want all
[09:23] the energy there we want all the Bitcoin
[09:25] miners there and his speech also at
[09:28] Bitcoin Nashville I think it was
[09:30] uh was really scooted towards that I
[09:31] think that's one of the small highlights
[09:34] of of the speech where he talked about
[09:35] energy uh and where we talked about
[09:37] Bitcoin mining uh which was really
[09:39] interesting to see uh but we also see
[09:42] over the past couple of like 20 years
[09:45] where the European Union usually like is
[09:48] a little bit slower but catches up to
[09:50] what American does it's it's almost like
[09:54] we we're just following a few years
[09:56] behind um how how do you see
[10:00] uh in general that that going forward
[10:02] with with EU uh going uh a little bit
[10:06] more right with the EU going a little
[10:08] bit more uh towards Bitcoin is that
[10:11] actually now changing uh where we maybe
[10:13] have a next EU president that also talks
[10:17] about Bitcoin maybe the next U election
[10:19] Bitcoin is then already a topic where we
[10:21] just think like four years behind the US
[10:24] where us has this year already the topic
[10:26] EU this year it was not a real topic I I
[10:29] didn't find EU uh elections there was
[10:32] Bitcoin any Topic at all I feel like
[10:34] there was just like yeah it's no no
[10:37] topic is that changing is that do you
[10:40] see something there so let me first
[10:42] catch up with our previous Point again
[10:45] so basically you're right I mean the US
[10:48] is doing Pro mining regulation right now
[10:50] they are doing or developing Pro Bitcoin
[10:52] regulation right now um but I also see
[10:56] you know when I talk about the best for
[10:59] Bitcoin mining I just don't see only
[11:03] regulation I also see
[11:04] infrastructure and um you know there are
[11:09] I mean there have been these pictures of
[11:11] um I don't know which state it basically
[11:13] was of Bitcoin miners that had problems
[11:16] in the winter um because Winter's got
[11:19] unexpected cold and we have the same on
[11:22] the Summers um but here in Europe um we
[11:25] have a pretty good grid right we have a
[11:27] pretty good infrastructure here here and
[11:31] I think that this can play a key role
[11:34] here um on the meantime another Factor
[11:37] why I think and this is long term not
[11:39] just right now right now I agree um the
[11:42] US is the safe heaven um for become
[11:44] Mining and I personally also hope it
[11:47] will be because I think they have this
[11:49] more you know I would say liberal Spirit
[11:54] um where you can basically develop nice
[11:56] business Concepts where you can do
[11:58] business just um just where you are here
[12:01] everything is a little bit more
[12:03] complicated we have to really integrate
[12:04] the mining which forces us basically to
[12:08] use hydr cooled machines um which is
[12:11] basically water cooling and also these
[12:14] are is a little bit a different approach
[12:17] right um because um capex capital
[12:22] expenditure so The Upfront investment is
[12:25] a little bit higher um but you don't
[12:28] have so many parts that can be basically
[12:31] be broken that can break um like it's
[12:35] the case with air cooled machines um so
[12:39] I think that miners will more and more
[12:41] Embrace Europe and I'm talking about you
[12:44] know three years five years in the
[12:46] future but as soon as everything gets um
[12:50] a little bit clearer also regulational
[12:51] wise I consider personally Europe as one
[12:54] of the spots to be um beside the US um I
[12:59] personally am also convinced about China
[13:02] that they are basically mining already
[13:05] and they are doing it for a long time I
[13:07] have been in the Sichuan region um where
[13:11] where I used to see all the big dams all
[13:14] the energy infrastructure I I got
[13:17] invited to see a power plant a Hydro
[13:19] power plant from the inside which I I
[13:22] think produced around 60 megawatt or
[13:24] something um it's insane how much energy
[13:27] they have there this is basically the
[13:29] the center of China for energy
[13:30] production where they distributed all
[13:32] over over
[13:34] China and the guys my guides they just
[13:37] told me that they are pretty convinced
[13:38] that mining is still going on um
[13:41] secretly um in in certain circles it's
[13:45] kind of treated like an Open Secret so I
[13:48] think China is a good good spot to mind
[13:51] as well for Chinese companies of course
[13:53] they won't let um us-based companies in
[13:57] um so I think there are a couple good
[13:59] spots in the future and as soon as we
[14:02] got everything a little bit more clear
[14:03] here as soon as we have the evidences
[14:05] about Europe I think we have we are
[14:06] really good spot to be and your second
[14:09] question
[14:11] or yeah politics um of course Bitcoin
[14:15] didn't play any any kind of role in the
[14:18] EU elections back in the days I mean I
[14:20] think it was five or six months ago
[14:23] right the
[14:24] elections um but now with Bitcoin
[14:28] entering new bull run right since it um
[14:31] touched 100K I mean today is alltime
[14:34] high day uh we had a lot of these days
[14:36] in the last couple of weeks
[14:38] right
[14:40] um I see more and more interest coming
[14:44] in from all potential sites
[14:47] um I see it we are a Bitcoin only
[14:50] company right we are um building Energy
[14:53] Solutions but we are also kind of um we
[14:57] also kind of perceiv received as the
[15:00] Bitcoin company in Germany so we get a
[15:03] lot of inquiries not just about mining
[15:05] but about several topics about lightning
[15:08] um about payments about you know
[15:10] Hardware wallets like the people they at
[15:13] least need someone to talk to and I can
[15:16] definitely tell you that I observed that
[15:18] inquiries went went up since the Bull
[15:21] Run um now we see the Swiss Parliament
[15:25] um at least introducing a bill for a
[15:28] strategic Bitcoin Reserve um done by by
[15:31] Samuel kulman as I'm not um
[15:34] misinformed we also had the honor at the
[15:37] beginning of the year to give a workshop
[15:40] or at least um a company a speech in
[15:43] front of the German Parliament the
[15:45] bundestag together with other um big
[15:48] names in the in the Bitcoin space in
[15:51] Germany um I heard that Poland is
[15:55] talking or discussing a a potential bit
[15:58] uh Bitcoin strategic Reserve um I think
[16:01] the president candidate there is saying
[16:05] if he gets elected he'll introduce this
[16:07] kind of strategic Bitcoin reserve on the
[16:11] meantime um we see in Denmark um
[16:16] introducing a bill for you know
[16:18] realizing or unrealized g capital gain
[16:21] taxes I think up to 40 something percent
[16:25] which is crazy just
[16:27] imagine just by part participating in in
[16:30] Bitcoin and we all know it's number go
[16:33] up forever technology just by
[16:35] participating you are forced to pay
[16:37] taxes um on unrealist gains um this is
[16:41] really like a nightmare for me as a as a
[16:45] as a yeah Freedom loving individual as a
[16:49] bitcoiner and seeing how how certain
[16:52] states are discussing this kind of
[16:54] Taxation for Bitcoin uh we had Italy
[16:57] introducing a bill for 42% on capital
[17:00] gains taxes but I heard that they um
[17:04] stepped back from this they could not
[17:06] set it up um so I think it's still a
[17:11] two-sided um or you have two two two uh
[17:15] two directions in in European politics
[17:18] but overall I think what matters
[17:21] is is the is the European politics and
[17:26] we saw this right shift and before we
[17:29] were pretty how can I say concerned
[17:31] about politics but since then it
[17:34] actually plays no big role for in our
[17:36] business anymore I mean there is always
[17:38] this risk of Regulation but now with the
[17:41] US um coming up with big plans and I
[17:45] mean politicians may seem
[17:48] um busy sometimes uh but of course they
[17:52] see what's going on on financial markets
[17:54] they see what's going on um in Bitcoin
[17:57] and they of of course see how how game
[18:00] theory is playing out and I think at a
[18:02] certain point um that also German
[18:06] politicians want to participate on the
[18:08] upside of Bitcoin um want to at least
[18:11] see game theory or participate in the
[18:13] game theory even if we just uh really
[18:15] famously sold 50,000
[18:17] Bitcoin um but I think that this
[18:22] regulational um train of you know don't
[18:27] embracing the technology is getting
[18:29] slower slower and slower like Max Kaiser
[18:32] said before he always said um we will
[18:35] never see a big amount of States um
[18:38] forbidding Bitcoin because it makes no
[18:40] sense for them we will see embracing
[18:42] them and at least maybe subsidizing them
[18:45] absolutely I think those
[18:47] taxes uh there are a lot of socialist
[18:50] guys that just want to speak up and and
[18:53] propose things uh and we always have to
[18:55] wait if it actually comes into law and
[18:58] we see
[18:59] that it usually doesn't come into law I
[19:01] think unrealized C gains is something
[19:03] like that uh I think even cameel Harris
[19:06] was discussing it or like mentioning it
[19:08] I don't know uh if it was just like in
[19:10] the air or if she actually said it I
[19:12] don't know uh but it never comes there
[19:15] because obviously it's a really bad idea
[19:18] like yes you will you cannot tax
[19:21] something that hasn't been sold because
[19:24] the person holding that doesn't even
[19:25] have the money so you basically force
[19:27] him to sell his assets every year he
[19:31] will not do that he will just move to
[19:32] another count so that that that that
[19:35] topic is uh on such a high level uh so
[19:39] obviously a bad idea that I I don't I
[19:42] don't I don't even want to give it any
[19:44] air time uh but there are some really
[19:47] interesting points like the a lot of
[19:49] interesting points that that you
[19:50] mentioned first is like China I think
[19:52] China is super interesting I also talked
[19:55] with some people with OTC tasks because
[19:58] ch
[19:59] doesn't officially allow those those
[20:02] Bitcoin buys and stuff like that but the
[20:04] OTC desks they can track to certain
[20:06] extend the volume that they have from
[20:09] China and uh it has been tripling since
[20:15] 20121 uh so they report really high
[20:18] numbers out of China where people buy
[20:21] Bitcoin in China just not so officially
[20:24] and it seems to be the same story with
[20:27] China for the people that maybe are
[20:30] newer to the space China Bitcoin mining
[20:33] in China was really big like I think
[20:35] they owned a huge amount of miners
[20:38] before 2021 then there was a big exit uh
[20:42] and I I would say there's probably still
[20:45] like a 10% of the network there as as we
[20:48] all know we we don't know the official
[20:49] numbers we there's no official numbers
[20:51] of where Bitcoin mining is uh but it
[20:54] seems like rough estimates points
[20:56] towards that uh and I think that could
[20:59] be true but yeah there's no no no fixed
[21:02] number um maybe as an interesting
[21:05] question uh because you also deploy
[21:07] those those uh projects and you did that
[21:10] in Ethiopia in Finland um what are the
[21:13] factors that come into play when you
[21:15] look at new places to mine Bitcoin like
[21:18] what are the the things that you look
[21:21] for you mentioned infrastructure
[21:22] regulations what what are the things
[21:24] that you like okay let's let's go back
[21:26] uh to do this list and what I also
[21:29] thought is isn't every place where there
[21:32] are huge data centers also a good place
[21:34] to just mine Bitcoin there because the
[21:36] data centers basically have the same
[21:39] kind of requirements like we have to
[21:42] find cheap electricity where it's
[21:44] reliable and uh it doesn't matter where
[21:47] it is because we just need an internet
[21:49] connection so first of all um I think we
[21:54] both agree that the data center industry
[21:56] is a pretty good one right now to work
[21:59] in um doesn't matter if you're in AI or
[22:03] Bitcoin
[22:04] mining with a continuing digitalization
[22:07] we need more and more computing power
[22:09] and we all remember these days like two
[22:12] years ago when just jet GPT came up and
[22:15] every second prompt just got denied
[22:17] because there was no computing power
[22:19] available um to to process your
[22:22] prompt and this is getting better and
[22:24] better and this is because um companies
[22:27] entities um or yeah at least the
[22:30] business is increasing in this
[22:33] industry and we see more and more um
[22:37] people or businesses embracing it as
[22:40] well and just to make something clear
[22:43] again so I have only experience with
[22:47] mining in Ethiopia and South America um
[22:52] because we run self mining operations
[22:55] there um basically we host with other
[22:58] guys right we host with someone else um
[23:00] who's basically doing the work there so
[23:02] the how the business model normally
[23:04] works is you pay someone to import the
[23:07] miners the computers and to set them up
[23:10] and to run them for you because we have
[23:12] no um experience in Ethiopia how to at
[23:16] least deploy miners we are not will to
[23:18] set up a team that is going there to to
[23:21] take care of the
[23:22] maintenance and to take care of the
[23:24] repairs to handle everything so we pay a
[23:26] flat fee um it's like eight cents per
[23:30] kilowatt hour that someone takes care of
[23:33] this for us and we decided um that we
[23:37] want to expand our self- mining
[23:39] operations All Around the World in this
[23:42] style as this is a crucial pillar in our
[23:45] revenue streams for the company so every
[23:47] month terahash is doing x amount of um
[23:51] Revenue by yourself Mining and this is
[23:55] just one Revenue stream um the other
[23:57] Revenue stream is really
[23:59] by our model where we are basically
[24:02] operat by ourselves this is the case in
[24:05] Finland now uh where we are operating
[24:07] this one megawatt Genesis um Data Center
[24:12] and there we get basically paid from
[24:15] investors um to run their machines um
[24:19] this is the second Revenue stream and
[24:21] the third Revenue stream is of course um
[24:23] Consulting and setting up um facilities
[24:27] here in Germany
[24:29] helping and finding how basically
[24:32] interested parties um like District
[24:35] heating companies energy companies can
[24:37] Implement mining in their in their
[24:41] businesses
[24:42] and sorry what was your question again I
[24:46] originally asked of like where how what
[24:49] are the factors in involved in like what
[24:51] is the best place yes so typically I I
[24:55] already mentioned it um before um we I
[24:58] mean the overall criteria are internet
[25:02] and electricity this is the most
[25:04] important you don't need a strong
[25:06] internet connection you don't need
[25:07] fiberglass um I always say it's enough
[25:10] to basically run one stalling and you
[25:13] can um at least run two or three
[25:15] containers of miners with one stalling
[25:18] that is enough I have seen this in
[25:20] Canada in the US where people just
[25:22] basically run their containers somewhere
[25:24] in the desert next to an old um oil
[25:27] field and and have no grid connection or
[25:30] no no no fiberglass and they just
[25:32] install the stalling and then I mean it
[25:36] also depends especially on your
[25:39] electricity rate so how much do you have
[25:41] to pay for the
[25:43] electricity um I would say that Opex so
[25:48] the operational expenditures um the
[25:50] costs per per kilowatt hour makes at
[25:54] least 80% of your business um so or at
[25:59] least electricity costs make 80% of the
[26:02] cost of your business and the rest is
[26:04] like maintenance um Administration all
[26:06] this stuff but 80% of your business
[26:09] costs are related to energy costs so
[26:12] these um are playing a key
[26:14] factor and I know that many people have
[26:18] no yeah no clue about what what um price
[26:23] per kilowatt hour is mining still
[26:25] profitable um of course it depends on on
[26:28] the side between um beer markets and
[26:30] bull markets um bull markets is highly
[26:33] profitable if I break it down per
[26:35] kilowatt hour you can make with the
[26:38] newest machines something between 20 to
[26:40] 25 cents per kilowatt hour in the bull
[26:43] market and in the Beer Market you're
[26:46] close to five maybe four cents depending
[26:48] on your equipment um so in general we
[26:52] see the industry around I would say
[26:55] public miners have an average around
[26:57] seven cents
[26:58] um smaller miners that are more flexible
[27:01] in moving that don't have to satisfy
[27:03] shareholders that can more or less um or
[27:06] that are more or less a little bit you
[27:08] know more dynamic in in in adapting to
[27:11] new um circumstances I would say they
[27:15] are operating between three and a half
[27:18] and six to seven cents and then of
[27:22] course you have this high risk High
[27:24] return um operations um which are
[27:27] basically too much risk for for a lot of
[27:30] people they get busted all the time and
[27:33] uh what I mean with that is when you
[27:35] basically send your container over to
[27:37] Venezuela where you have a anti- Bitcoin
[27:39] State and um yeah they are seizing
[27:43] mining containers regularly but you
[27:45] basically get electricity for one cents
[27:48] half a cent or
[27:49] something and um so electricity rate is
[27:53] a key factor for for for choosing the
[27:55] right mining operation or mining site
[27:59] um and what's pretty interesting so how
[28:01] we choose our um or how we look at the
[28:05] the yeah the choosing of mining sites is
[28:09] basically um how can we integrate mining
[28:12] there are there several hours where they
[28:14] always have excess energy is electricity
[28:17] needed 24/7 is there maybe heat needed
[28:20] 24/7 that we can sell to at least lower
[28:23] our price um what do I mean with that is
[28:26] basically you pay let's let's say x
[28:29] amount of cents per kilowatt hour for
[28:31] electricity rate um and you get x amount
[28:36] um of cents per kilowatt hour sold heat
[28:40] and if you do the counting between those
[28:42] big uh those both numbers you can
[28:45] basically say okay I can lower my
[28:46] electricity rates maybe to to a
[28:49] profitable range inside a profitable
[28:51] range um and this is mostly the case in
[28:56] in countries where you have a
[28:59] yeah a specific infrastructure that
[29:01] allows for that um we already talked
[29:04] about more Dynamic electricity
[29:07] generation in Europe this is because of
[29:09] this is because of the Renewables right
[29:12] um we build out a lot of solar a lot of
[29:14] wind and if the wind is blowing we got a
[29:17] lot of electricity if the sun is shining
[29:19] we got a lot of electricity if the Sun
[29:21] is not shining we have less electricity
[29:24] so our production curve and electricity
[29:26] is more
[29:28] Dynamic um so on the other side we need
[29:30] a more Dynamic um consumer but it also
[29:34] means that PPA which stands for power
[29:37] purchase agreements which is basically
[29:39] what we as private people have um like
[29:42] long-term energy contracts hey you
[29:45] signed this contract for five years you
[29:47] have a fixed rate for um 30 cents per
[29:50] kilowatt hour um these are so-called
[29:53] ppas and now we are seeing more and more
[29:55] that companies have to join the spot
[29:57] markets for energy so they have to
[29:59] manage their um how they buy electricity
[30:03] basically and this is something which
[30:06] makes it obviously more
[30:09] complicated um because the electricity
[30:11] Market is pretty volatile but it makes
[30:14] it also pretty interesting as if you
[30:17] have a good trading department and you
[30:19] know how everything works you can really
[30:21] achieve good achieve good prices um
[30:24] electricity prices um so yeah on one
[30:27] hand it's a challenge on the other hand
[30:29] it's um it's a benefit and for this you
[30:32] need of course a proper regulational
[30:35] setup um to doing this trading and this
[30:38] is mostly the case I mean Finland is the
[30:40] perfect example um they have low taxes
[30:42] or transmission grid fees they have a
[30:45] really liberalized um energy markets
[30:49] where you can at least um do good of
[30:51] this um buy stuff where you can buy
[30:55] electricity um if you know what you're
[30:57] doing in a good in a good way and they
[31:00] have um this open interest in exploring
[31:03] with Bitcoin mining um but now we also
[31:06] see tendencies in Germany unfortunately
[31:08] I don't know about um Austria but I
[31:11] heard about some really interesting
[31:12] going ongoing projects in Austria as
[31:14] well for grid
[31:16] stabilization that our transmission grid
[31:19] fees in Germany are about to become
[31:22] flexible which basically means um that
[31:26] in peak times when a lot of
[31:28] electricity um is in the grid that
[31:32] so-called grid prioritizing assets like
[31:36] Bitcoin mining that you can just turn on
[31:38] to consume over capacities get a better
[31:41] rate of transmission grid fee than other
[31:43] assets that um are basically um
[31:46] delivering still to the Grid at the same
[31:48] time if there's not a lot of um energy
[31:50] in the grid um transmission fees uh
[31:53] transmission grid fees will will spike
[31:55] in price so we are getting a more I
[31:59] would say yeah we are now coming closer
[32:02] to Market mechanisms um a little bit
[32:04] away from just saying hey our fix our
[32:07] fixed transmission grid fee is 7% or
[32:09] seven cents to a more I would say called
[32:12] free market mechanism where it says okay
[32:15] in case that there are overc capacities
[32:17] transmission fees transmission grid fees
[32:20] will get lower and um in case that
[32:22] there's not a lot of energy available um
[32:25] taking or sucking energy out of the grid
[32:27] will get more expensive so that
[32:29] incentives play a bigger role than just
[32:32] um than just regulation I partnered up
[32:35] with coin vigilante this is the most
[32:38] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[32:41] saw created by anyone look at that
[32:44] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[32:47] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[32:50] perfect subtle elent way to go out there
[32:53] and show that you are a bitcoiner and
[32:56] that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[32:59] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[33:02] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[33:05] watch collections you have the date of
[33:08] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[33:11] there and of course also the block
[33:13] height and which EPO we are currently in
[33:17] I love the level of detail they put in
[33:20] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[33:22] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[33:25] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[33:28] love those watches so so much if you
[33:31] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[33:33] regular basis I guess you already bought
[33:36] some Bitcoin and now the most important
[33:38] step is to keep the Bitcoin keep them
[33:41] secure in a hardware wallet my personal
[33:44] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[33:46] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[33:48] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[33:51] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[33:54] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[33:57] with the code Robin at the checkout
[33:59] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[34:03] your bitbox and the next step is to
[34:06] really level up your sovereignty as an
[34:08] individual you have to have the most
[34:10] secure self- custody setup you have to
[34:13] secure your own devices you have to
[34:16] protect your privacy you have to set up
[34:19] an inheritance plan and depending on
[34:21] where you live you even want to have a
[34:24] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[34:26] in case some something goes really
[34:28] really wrong and through all those steps
[34:30] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[34:33] step by step and if you visit the
[34:35] bitcoin.com
[34:38] partners robobin you even get a 30
[34:40] minute free call to find out how you can
[34:43] level up your sovereignty that's a good
[34:46] point and uh I talked with how is it
[34:49] called I think Max from 21 energy uh
[34:53] about that on the podcast just a a few
[34:56] weeks maybe a month ago something like
[34:57] that
[34:58] they actually do that in Austria also
[35:00] with a container and they're basically
[35:02] getting paid to be ready to take on
[35:06] electricity that is too much in the in
[35:09] the grid right now and they are running
[35:11] it maybe 30 minutes maybe 20 minutes a
[35:14] day but they're getting paid on the off
[35:17] time which is a great deal uh it makes
[35:20] it's profitable for for mining Bitcoin
[35:22] and it helps Austrian crit uh to be more
[35:26] stable uh and I think there are some
[35:28] there are some advantages that are just
[35:30] a no-brainer to Bitcoin
[35:32] mining outside of being securing the the
[35:37] most amazing money ever but just the
[35:39] fact that you can stabilize the grid uh
[35:41] just the fact that you can lower
[35:43] electricity cost in certain areas uh and
[35:46] you can use it for for heat uh reuse
[35:50] there are amazing projects like that
[35:52] also uh so Bitcoin mining seems to be if
[35:56] you really look closer uh for everyone
[35:59] that is in the energy sector or wants to
[36:02] be in the energy sector really a
[36:04] no-brainer and what what annoys me the
[36:07] most as we talked before about uh
[36:11] politics and now about energy that mix
[36:13] up is does not uh is not nice for me
[36:17] it's like th those politicians that
[36:19] should be for green energy that should
[36:21] be for um how can we make the uh energy
[36:25] more renewable how can we make all those
[36:27] things they against Bitcoin I mean the
[36:29] energy F of of Bitcoin I don't know I
[36:32] don't hear a lot of it of it anymore I
[36:34] think since this year especially since
[36:36] black R came into space since like a lot
[36:38] of things came into space it's just not
[36:41] a uh not a topic of discussion anymore
[36:44] but there still like it it needs a
[36:45] little bit time to to probably blow off
[36:49] even more uh but it's it's super
[36:52] interesting how useful Bitcoin mining is
[36:56] outside of the thing that it actually
[36:59] does like securing
[37:01] Bitcoin even outside it's just like an
[37:03] amazing uh tool for that so yeah I'm
[37:07] just like I'm really amazed the more and
[37:08] more I look into it and I'm I'm getting
[37:11] to be a Bitcoin mining fan and and maybe
[37:13] I have to look into 2025 a little bit
[37:16] more and uh educate myself even more in
[37:19] that space because till now I just like
[37:21] ignored that uh space of Bitcoin too
[37:24] much yeah that's that's a good point
[37:27] what you just say right said right now
[37:30] um I I don't know since when are you in
[37:32] in Bitcoin Robin uh I'm approaching my
[37:36] uh the my fifth year so like I'm now
[37:38] four and a half years I think into
[37:41] Bitcoin so from my point of view you're
[37:44] an OG I joined the space in
[37:47] 21 I joined the space in
[37:49] 21 and I grew up with this Narrative of
[37:53] Bitcoin is using too much energy when I
[37:56] talk with people um at the beginning of
[37:59] my journey I mean we all know how it is
[38:01] as soon as you got orange pilled you
[38:03] start to talk to people and say hey I
[38:04] found the solution for everything um
[38:07] Bitcoin is doing this Bitcoin is fixing
[38:09] that um where I actually also lost a lot
[38:13] of people on bitcoin that's that's also
[38:15] part of the TR um understandably right
[38:18] um but this narrative was always around
[38:22] or it it just evolved during that time
[38:25] and there was a recent article or a
[38:28] recent um Graphics that showed where all
[38:31] of this fut is actually coming from and
[38:34] it's basically from a guy um I think he
[38:36] works for the European Central Bank uh
[38:39] which is called Alex Def and he was
[38:42] setting up all this narrative Bitcoin is
[38:44] using so much energy like Sweden or you
[38:48] can you know all of of this um trash
[38:51] without looking into the benefits that
[38:54] energy usage is actually not something
[38:57] bad
[38:58] um that you have a correlation between
[39:00] wealth and um the ability to use energy
[39:03] for you as humans right I always point
[39:06] back to the to the to the point where
[39:09] humans manag to to to control fire right
[39:12] suddenly we were able to to to see in
[39:15] the dark we were able to cook our food
[39:17] which extended our
[39:19] lifespan and um this was just the one of
[39:22] the first examples how we managed to to
[39:25] to get control over energy and it's the
[39:28] same like with industrialization
[39:29] suddenly we we're much more productive
[39:32] and I think that energy consumption in
[39:34] general is a good thing it always
[39:36] depends um from which source is this
[39:38] energy
[39:39] coming and this has been completely out
[39:42] of context um so far I know or as far as
[39:46] I
[39:47] know um something between 50 to 60% or
[39:53] 70% um and it's an increasing number is
[39:57] coming out of Renewables um the main
[40:00] driver behind bitcoin's energy is is um
[40:03] Hydro energy um as it's cheap as it's
[40:06] 247 available and we see a more and more
[40:11] increasing adoption of Renewables like
[40:13] wind and solar um and it's the only it's
[40:17] the only industry that is basically um
[40:19] searching its way through own incentives
[40:22] into this uh renewable sector as this is
[40:24] the cheapest available energy right um
[40:28] coal gets more and more expensive um as
[40:31] it say fined
[40:33] commodity um we had this um stories in
[40:36] Kazakhstan where you paid basically like
[40:38] two cents or something per kilowatt hour
[40:41] um which was out of coal but this was
[40:43] just because it was subsidized by the
[40:45] state um in the free market miners have
[40:49] the incentive to look for the cheapest
[40:50] energy sources and they are tapping more
[40:53] and more into renewable sources where
[40:55] nobody else can basically use the energy
[40:57] I have been into Paraguay like one year
[41:00] ago and suddenly I just saw a data
[41:03] center in the middle of the
[41:06] Jungle and I think um and this brings me
[41:10] back to your question um the data center
[41:14] industry basically is is is growing and
[41:18] you have to make a big difference
[41:20] between conventional data centers what
[41:22] do I mean with that I mean I mean we are
[41:25] all always the um the ex ones with our
[41:28] Bitcoin mining container right um we can
[41:30] set it up really quick we don't have
[41:34] that much costs and infrastructure we
[41:36] basically just need the cooling um we
[41:39] don't need a
[41:40] fiberglass um internet connection so we
[41:43] are more like the way quick and dirty we
[41:47] can do um tap into into sources that are
[41:50] available immediately we can send our
[41:52] container to start uh and we are able to
[41:55] interrupt our operations this is really
[41:57] important important this is one of the
[41:58] main differences between Bitcoin mining
[42:01] data centers and conventional data
[42:03] centers like AI Netflix Amazon um you
[42:06] name it because you have um users on the
[42:10] servers right just imagine Robin um
[42:12] after a long day of work you're sitting
[42:14] on your couch you're laying on your
[42:15] couch um having your drink just wanted
[42:17] to watch a little bit of Netflix or you
[42:19] want to stream um a match and then
[42:23] suddenly servers turn down and you can't
[42:26] see your match right right um so the
[42:28] costs or the opportunity costs are
[42:30] pretty high here for these data center
[42:32] op
[42:33] operators and basically they all get
[42:36] paid for providing a 100% up time um
[42:41] which is not the case with us we get
[42:43] paid for providing flexibility in in in
[42:45] switching on and switching off our data
[42:48] centers and another big difference is
[42:51] and this is just you know for different
[42:54] investor profiles I would say um AI data
[42:58] centers or conventional data centers
[43:01] they have a
[43:02] higher is it called
[43:04] Tire um Tire level which basically is
[43:08] how
[43:09] redundant does infrastructure needs to
[43:11] be how safe it needs to be against um
[43:14] outages how important are the operations
[43:17] that are going on there so they have a
[43:20] higher level of these which basically
[43:22] leads to a much more higher capex
[43:25] investment and and gener speaking um we
[43:30] see
[43:31] Tendencies for yeah you can just briefly
[43:35] roughly calculate for one megawatt of
[43:36] bitco mining which is basically one one
[43:38] container you can calculate something
[43:41] between 600 up to 1
[43:44] million, um$ 600,000 up to $1
[43:48] million and in the AI it's more
[43:51] something like 10 times that investment
[43:53] so one megawatt costs around um six up
[43:58] to 10 maybe up to 15
[44:00] millionar and but of course your returns
[44:03] per kilowatt hour are also higher than
[44:05] in Bitcoin mining Bitcoin mining is
[44:07] really competitive it's Cutting Edge um
[44:11] so these are I would say the main
[44:13] differences between between Bitcoin
[44:15] mining and conventional data centers
[44:18] that's super interesting I never thought
[44:19] about that because yeah Bitcoin miners
[44:23] um you don't have a reputation cost to
[44:26] it like if if your Netflix movie all of
[44:29] the sudden is not streaming you're
[44:31] hitting on Netflix you're paying for
[44:32] something that you could get
[44:35] illegal St might be better than than the
[44:38] the than the legal stuff that you pay
[44:40] for um so obviously you don't want that
[44:43] you you pay for the convenience and the
[44:45] service for Bitcoin miners yes of course
[44:48] it's better if it has 100% up time but
[44:50] if it's 99% up time you only lose 1% uh
[44:55] if uh if uh if if a Netflix subscription
[44:58] is down 1% it might be down on the wrong
[45:01] 1% it has and it has like a 10% impact
[45:03] or like a 15% impact which is a really
[45:06] interesting thing that I never thought
[45:07] about it's also you mentioned it before
[45:09] a little bit um starlink probably is a
[45:13] real game changer for for Bitcoin miners
[45:16] to have available internet basically
[45:19] everywhere where you go like there's
[45:21] like can if you have a clear point to
[45:24] the sky you you have internet if I
[45:27] understood it correct I don't have a
[45:29] styling till now but I really want to
[45:31] get one I'm in a contract with Austrian
[45:33] company and if that runs out I probably
[45:36] get a styling because then I can just
[45:38] take that internet with me all around
[45:41] the world so that that that probably is
[45:43] a really interesting uh was a good good
[45:46] one it's it's it's just you know one
[45:49] part of or
[45:51] one piece of the puzzle to decentralize
[45:54] mining more and more and
[45:57] this is also a point I wanted to make
[46:01] um regarding to your point you or to the
[46:04] topic you you talked before that you
[46:06] have to educate yourself a bit into bom
[46:09] mining um I mentioned already a couple
[46:13] of times that it is getting a highly
[46:16] specialized industry right um so the
[46:20] times where people are mining on the
[46:22] laptops or at least um yeah just running
[46:26] one Miner um for for creating or for
[46:29] mining reasons uh mostly over and this
[46:34] is a personal how can I say it's
[46:36] personally really important for me that
[46:38] people are well educated in mining that
[46:40] they understand what they are doing and
[46:42] from my perspective um it's kind of
[46:45] misleading if you think about to invest
[46:48] into two or three Miners and run them
[46:51] somewhere in the data center um
[46:54] overseas um because actually I mean I'm
[46:58] now coming from a German
[47:00] perspective the reason is this um as
[47:02] soon as you are deploying just one minor
[47:06] and I'm not talking about the nerd Miner
[47:08] From Nerd Miner de I'm talking about a
[47:11] real minor
[47:13] right um as soon as you're deploying one
[47:15] minor you actually have to um run a
[47:19] company for that as you are being
[47:22] considered as doing business you have to
[47:25] run a business for this and and what
[47:28] business brings is um the obligation to
[47:31] do taxes to do all of these kind of
[47:35] stuff right and this is something where
[47:38] not a lot of um mining providers service
[47:42] providers talk about as it's basically
[47:44] not a problem right um what happens with
[47:47] the taxes of the customers um but I
[47:50] think um or at least yeah to do the to
[47:54] do the um accounting for just one Miner
[47:58] will take fixed costs of around
[48:01] $1,500 a year even if you don't have a
[48:04] lot of revenues there um but it's just
[48:07] like the normal thing you can I mean a
[48:10] holding also consumes like one and a
[48:11] half k um for for accounting and this is
[48:15] just money you won't get in with M with
[48:18] mining just with one machine so it makes
[48:21] basically no sense to just from a from
[48:23] an investment perspective um to just buy
[48:26] one machine uh two machines five
[48:29] machines and let them
[48:31] run um I think the market will change
[48:33] here as well um as we see a big retail
[48:36] market right now um but and honestly we
[48:41] thought about doing this as well because
[48:43] we are bitcoiners from hard right and we
[48:46] want to do mining accessible for
[48:49] everyone um but it's just not profitable
[48:53] and I think as bitcoiners we also know
[48:55] how important it is that at at least
[48:57] business is running profitable and this
[48:59] is why we decided for our approach our
[49:02] company um our investors that we are
[49:04] just dealing with institutional
[49:06] investors um that it is basically you
[49:09] know um kind of fun for everyone and
[49:12] that nobody is at least disappointed
[49:15] because as soon as you have disappointed
[49:17] clients everything everything starts to
[49:19] be a little bit
[49:21] um yeah um not that nice um we have less
[49:26] clients that's another big Advantage for
[49:29] us um just imagine you have to fill up
[49:31] one data center with one megawatt with
[49:33] 300 different clients and instead of
[49:37] maybe two or three clients makes a big
[49:40] difference so yeah if you're considering
[49:43] maybe I mean I get a lot of in uh
[49:46] messages on LinkedIn um or or via email
[49:49] if they can just run one machine with us
[49:53] and I always tell them think properly um
[49:56] bring them my arguments I present them
[49:58] my arguments and most of them then
[50:00] decide against a Bitcoin mining
[50:02] investment I mean you also have a lot of
[50:04] upsides right you have a constant cash
[50:07] flow um you diversify a little bit um I
[50:11] met a lot of people that say hey I have
[50:13] a lot of Bitcoin and now I want to
[50:15] diversify in case the on- Rams get gets
[50:18] closed like I don't know exchange or
[50:20] whatever I still have my access to my
[50:23] Bitcoin so there when I talk with
[50:26] different investors 10 different
[50:27] investors means 10 different um ideas or
[50:31] reasons why they want to invest into
[50:33] Mining and um yeah just just uh this
[50:38] little s uh information for you that you
[50:41] you should think properly mining is a
[50:43] real industry um mining is real business
[50:46] it's highly competitive and I think you
[50:50] can pretty fast run into a risk of not
[50:54] investing yeah not investing um properly
[50:59] when you just set up with one or two
[51:01] miners which is an interesting topic
[51:04] because uh mining is such a uh important
[51:08] thing for Bitcoin and we we need it to
[51:11] be as decentralized as possible and we
[51:14] now have basically three four Bitcoin
[51:17] mining pools that uh have the majority
[51:21] of the the the network um ocean is
[51:24] trying to do interesting stuff on that
[51:26] front um there is not too many Hardware
[51:30] providers uh and they are also not uh
[51:33] being as as transparent as they might
[51:36] could be uh so like there are a lot of
[51:39] interesting uh discussions around uh
[51:42] that that topic I not an expert on that
[51:47] I just see uh there's like that could be
[51:50] problems arising do you see
[51:53] any do you have any bad feelings around
[51:56] my
[51:57] where you see like oh maybe it's not
[52:00] decentralized enough like for me it is
[52:03] like there's never a 100%
[52:06] decentralization um and Bitcoin is by
[52:09] far the most decentralized of all
[52:12] Technologies like those facts are just
[52:14] just true for me um but I think we can
[52:17] always work towards getting more
[52:19] decentralized game more secure getting
[52:21] more robust of a network especially if
[52:23] we unload more and more people on the
[52:25] network uh how do you look at Bitcoin
[52:28] mining from a perspective of uh Bitcoin
[52:31] Network Health standpoint and Mining
[52:34] being one of the yeah three major
[52:37] pillars of like Bitcoin hodlers of uh
[52:40] full note Runners and stuff like that um
[52:42] how do you look at that yeah it's pretty
[52:44] interesting I think um the best way to
[52:47] describe it is in the words of my old
[52:51] friend Bob Bernett um which I met back
[52:53] in the days in Prague um CEO of Barefoot
[52:56] mining co-founder of ocean pool beside
[52:59] um Luke the Shire I probably
[53:03] mispronounced it and Ja
[53:05] dors and he always said that it's really
[53:09] important that we have a healthy mix of
[53:11] you know mining facilities in in the
[53:15] ecosystem and what he means is basically
[53:17] the size of the mining systems or um
[53:21] mining facilities um back in the days
[53:25] like one year ago I have been to Texas
[53:28] um to get inside knowledge into the
[53:31] market and me and my colleague we we we
[53:36] just passed at the Rock fac facility of
[53:39] Riot platforms which is one public
[53:42] traded minor um traded at the NASDAQ I
[53:46] guess and they are now setting up their
[53:50] corana facility which has a total
[53:53] capacity of 1
[53:55] gaw um just for comparison one gwatt is
[53:59] what you know nuclear power plants can
[54:01] do so they are basically installing or
[54:04] setting up their facility um that is
[54:07] roughly consuming the energy of one
[54:09] nuclear power plant and they are public
[54:12] on grid right um so if you would now
[54:16] imagine that these um these facilities
[54:19] we call them elepant as they are pretty
[54:21] you know strong and big but easy to hunt
[54:25] basically um and as soon as America or a
[54:30] state would decide to turn down
[54:33] electricity for these minus what would
[54:35] happen then if we only have these
[54:37] elephants in the
[54:38] ecosystem we would see a significant
[54:41] drop in hash rate right and if we still
[54:44] would have um 2,000 blocks to go until
[54:48] the difficulty adjustment um but see at
[54:52] least um I don't know a 50% drop in hash
[54:55] rate this could take months or years
[54:58] until we reach the new difficulty
[55:00] adjustment which um could really at
[55:03] least harm the network and um so I can
[55:07] see this um this Vector but I think it's
[55:10] getting better and better we can see a
[55:13] trend that a lot of so-called horses are
[55:17] coming up they are midsize um they are
[55:20] basically seable but they're not that
[55:22] easy to hunt they are more flexible
[55:24] right and my Bob refers to that
[55:27] facilities I think something between 500
[55:30] kilowatts or several hundred kilowatts
[55:32] which is basically 20 to 50 miners up to
[55:37] I think um something like five five
[55:41] megawatts or something and these are
[55:44] more flexible these facilities are
[55:46] mostly um build it in
[55:49] containers um many of them especially in
[55:52] Canada and um Texas or America are not
[55:56] on grid they are off grid so they have
[55:59] no public grid connection they are not
[56:00] affected by actions that are going on
[56:02] the grid um so they can continue
[56:06] producing Bitcoin um or at least
[56:09] continue um their mining operations even
[56:12] if the grid is going
[56:14] down and um then at last we have the
[56:18] rabbits so-called rabbits and these are
[56:22] practically um impossible to hunt right
[56:25] um You can maybe catch one or two but
[56:28] you can't get all the rabbits and um
[56:31] these are basically single miners right
[56:33] they have one or two miners maybe at
[56:35] home heating their homes um maybe
[56:37] someone is just um fanatic enthusiastic
[56:41] about mining running one minor and um
[56:45] these are the people you can't catch
[56:46] these are the miners you can't basically
[56:48] catch as you don't know where's mining
[56:50] where who's actually running just one
[56:52] minor these can be all the holes around
[56:54] us we wouldn't know it right and I think
[56:57] um for a healthy mining ecosystem we
[57:00] really need a proper mix of these
[57:03] different um types of mining facilities
[57:06] and I think this is going forward so we
[57:09] are building our or we focused on horses
[57:13] basically um 21 energy
[57:16] maximilan the guy the CEO of 21 energy
[57:20] you mentioned before is selling um they
[57:23] are selling their heaters right where
[57:25] they have one two three minus inside so
[57:28] I would put them more in the category of
[57:30] of the rabbits um even if I know that
[57:32] they're working on really nice products
[57:34] coming up um that are a little bit
[57:36] bigger um and we also see a healthy I
[57:41] think growth or strategies in the public
[57:43] traded miners um which is basically
[57:46] really interesting we all know Bitcoin
[57:48] is all about Game Theory
[57:50] right and public traded miners in
[57:53] general have the highest costs of
[57:54] production which basically means
[57:56] um they have the highest cost of
[57:59] electricity and you know also how it is
[58:02] as a bitcoiner sometimes you start to
[58:04] philosophi about potential scenarios um
[58:08] about certain certain
[58:11] plans and we are seeing now that big
[58:13] miners like Mara or I think Riot was the
[58:17] recent one are playing the micro
[58:20] strategy game they are starting to issue
[58:23] senior convertible notes for a 0%
[58:26] interest and buying Bitcoin with that um
[58:30] instead of only focusing on mining so
[58:32] they are basically open up a new
[58:34] business field and yeah the game theory
[58:38] behind this is as well they have
[58:40] shareholders and they somehow have to
[58:41] satisfied the shareholders and their
[58:43] shareholders normally they they don't
[58:46] care how they get satisfied is it if
[58:48] it's really Bitcoin mining or if it's
[58:50] just like buying Bitcoin mining and
[58:52] having higher returns per
[58:53] share and um maybe we'll see some some
[58:58] public traded companies you know opting
[59:00] out their original business operational
[59:03] mining to the Michael sailor um business
[59:07] model um this is just a a side thought
[59:10] from myself um I don't know if this is
[59:12] going to happen it was just funny I had
[59:14] this thought or I came up with this
[59:16] thought like uh two months ago and
[59:18] suddenly Mara is issuing the senior
[59:19] convertible notes buying
[59:22] Bitcoin and um another big vector I
[59:26] think this is honestly like the biggest
[59:28] bottleneck are the
[59:30] pools um you have 50% of the Bitcoin
[59:34] Network controlled by two pools roughly
[59:38] 50% and these are End Pool and Foundry
[59:41] one is us one is Chinese and
[59:45] um then you have the the remaining 50%
[59:50] maybe divided into six seven eight pools
[59:54] and the rest is basically playing no
[59:55] role
[59:57] and the problem here is that you don't
[59:59] know what's going on behind the curtain
[60:01] these pools are basically companies they
[60:03] are not open source so we don't really
[60:06] know what's going on um they have their
[60:09] systems like fpps which stands for a
[60:12] full pay per share which is basically
[60:14] one mechanism how miners get
[60:17] compensated um but we actually as a
[60:20] minor we can't compare different pools
[60:23] pretty good um who's paying more who's L
[60:26] as machines are going down sometimes um
[60:29] we have technical issues in providing
[60:31] our hash rate to the pools whatever and
[60:34] I personally see it as a bottleneck
[60:36] because we already had these cases where
[60:39] rep pool censored transactions I think
[60:41] it was one of the big pools um I don't
[60:43] know if it was the Russian one via BTC
[60:47] um the Chinese one end pool or the the
[60:49] the American Foundry um but basically
[60:53] they have a lot of power right and as
[60:56] right now or as the industry is working
[60:59] right now pools have the authority to
[61:02] give the miners to provide the miners
[61:05] the template that they should look for a
[61:08] V for a valid hash right so they provide
[61:10] all the transactions they choose the
[61:12] transactions that the miners have
[61:14] to um that the miners have to um
[61:19] execute and in order to to prevent
[61:23] future problems with the
[61:25] decentralization and especially sensor
[61:27] resistance of Bitcoin I think such
[61:30] projects like ocean um deserve a lot of
[61:34] um at least public attraction or um yeah
[61:40] deserved um public attraction because
[61:42] they are fully open source um they they
[61:46] they do good stuff for miners we get um
[61:49] we get fresh fresh Bitcoin directly from
[61:51] the blockchain when we work with the
[61:53] normal pool um we provide our hash rate
[61:57] and the pool is sending us Bitcoin that
[62:00] they had before so we don't know where
[62:02] the Bitcoins are basically coming from
[62:04] are they have they been used in ille
[62:06] illegal um transactions in criminals
[62:10] whatever and with ocean it's different
[62:12] you get the coinbase or you get your
[62:14] share of the coinbase transaction which
[62:16] is basically the transaction um
[62:19] triggered as soon as a valid block has
[62:22] been found the big problem here is um um
[62:26] how do you enter a pretty big system
[62:30] with a pool that is new and has almost
[62:33] no hash rate right um because who is
[62:36] joining a pool that is doing no revenues
[62:40] um so this is always the the
[62:42] problem and I think ocean is now running
[62:46] with around four exra hashes um which is
[62:51] not nothing but it's also not that big
[62:53] right uh we have almost 800 EXA hashes
[62:56] in the in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem
[62:59] right now so we still have a long way to
[63:01] go there but we are fully supporting
[63:04] this approach um we are running a first
[63:07] um test phase with our machines we
[63:09] pointed 50 Peter hases to to to Ocean to
[63:13] see how everything is going and I have
[63:16] to say I like this open transparent um
[63:19] approach and I think it's crucial for
[63:22] all um at least miners but ALS so
[63:25] Bitcoin is to at least be aware of this
[63:28] potential um Vector
[63:33] because I think there's also a lot of
[63:36] misunderstanding in the space because we
[63:38] always argument with yeah if one pool is
[63:40] um doing will'll change over to
[63:42] another pool but we saw this a lot of
[63:44] times and actually nobody's changing
[63:46] their pools um so I understand the I
[63:51] understand the theory behind it but um
[63:55] yeah
[63:56] in in in in Practical terms it just
[63:58] looks different and it's still a big
[64:00] problem so I really hope that we'll see
[64:03] a lot of work going into
[64:04] decentralization of pools in the future
[64:07] in open source pools um that we can
[64:10] really tackle this problem which I see
[64:12] personally as one of of a critical
[64:17] problems in in in Bitcoin we need more
[64:20] pools and not just the ones that we we
[64:23] jump into really exactly yeah basically
[64:26] there are a lot of pools I mean there
[64:27] are really a lot of pools you can look
[64:29] them up but the problem is how do you
[64:31] get to a critical mass of hash r or
[64:35] users um that it's you know that it's um
[64:39] that you're running profitable as soon
[64:40] as you join the pool because if you just
[64:42] find one block um every three years the
[64:45] pool is not working profitable which
[64:47] basically means um no miners joining the
[64:49] pool right exactly um I think I just was
[64:54] like uh so people have some something to
[64:56] look at for the people that don't have
[64:58] the visual I just pulled up from mol.
[65:01] space at the mining dashboard uh the
[65:04] pool distribution and there we can see
[65:06] Foundry USA has uh 3 uh 2% 33% actually
[65:12] uh we have and poool with 20% and then
[65:14] via PTC with around
[65:17] 15% uh and then so on and so forth and
[65:20] there are a lot of like uh in in the uh
[65:23] 25% of of of the the whole hash rate
[65:26] comes from a lot of smaller pools uh but
[65:29] like if you look at the big ones Foundry
[65:31] and pool and VI PTC uh they are like
[65:35] really huge and the even the just the uh
[65:38] biggest two alone have together uh let's
[65:43] say what is it they have
[65:45] 50 yeah like 53% that's that's that's
[65:49] huge uh and and that's basically the the
[65:52] problem that we are talking about I'm
[65:54] always a visual guy so I was was like
[65:56] let's let's pull up the visual uh for
[65:58] for that yeah it's great I mean you can
[66:00] get all the information on mol. space
[66:03] right um for mining lightning or normal
[66:05] Bitcoin transactions and um it helped me
[66:09] also a lot when I was joining this
[66:10] industry two years or ago to really
[66:14] understand how everything works so if
[66:16] somebody's really interested in in in
[66:19] mining I think this is a side where
[66:22] which I always bring up when we educate
[66:23] people or institutions about about
[66:25] mining absolutely me mol. space uh a
[66:29] great great yes a great site I I make a
[66:33] lot of advertisement for that even
[66:34] though they don't pay me for that but
[66:36] it's such a great yes exactly I mean it
[66:39] basically supports your business as well
[66:40] because you can present everything in an
[66:43] easy fast uh and good way right to your
[66:46] listeners or viewers that's very true it
[66:48] would be uh it would be headache if I
[66:50] have to do it myself yes yes yes I see
[66:53] my note and just trying to figure the
[66:55] visuals and and doing it on a website
[66:58] they are making great uh great things um
[67:01] one thing that you mentioned is the
[67:03] Finland thing and I want to get it
[67:05] earlier in but uh it was so interesting
[67:07] to get down this Rabbit Hole
[67:09] um what are you seeing there as like the
[67:12] positive impacts of that project and
[67:14] what is that project because I think
[67:16] it's really interesting to talk on on a
[67:18] high level what can Bitcoin mining bring
[67:20] but you uh have insights in some uh real
[67:23] world examples and maybe you can give us
[67:25] from Finland or maybe if there's like a
[67:26] better project for that uh some insights
[67:29] uh what do you see actually uh in the
[67:32] real world what are the impacts and the
[67:35] positive advantages of of Bitcoin mining
[67:37] and integrating in a
[67:38] project so basically um of course it
[67:44] sensiti sensitives people um about their
[67:49] perception of Bitcoin
[67:51] right um because they finally see oh
[67:55] it's still getting warm here and um the
[67:58] seed is coming out of a data center or
[68:00] whatever
[68:02] and how we set everything up was more
[68:04] like okay um we have this problem or at
[68:09] least um our partner has a problem he
[68:11] has to produce the Heat and for this he
[68:14] has to burn um fossils right this is
[68:18] basically how you how you generate heat
[68:21] um in today's facilities and we CH just
[68:25] came up with the idea of selling him the
[68:27] heat for a good price and um running
[68:32] this data center on green energy so we
[68:34] are also providing him with a
[68:36] solution um for you know upcoming EU
[68:40] regulation until I guess
[68:42] 2030 where he has to
[68:45] decarbonize his heat
[68:48] production and since we started this
[68:50] project we see a increasing interested
[68:55] interest
[68:56] in these kind of projects um public
[69:00] companies um are more and more putting
[69:03] money into this projects and we have a
[69:09] lot of potential for next year in this
[69:12] sector as it's a win-win-win situation
[69:15] for everyone for our investors for us
[69:17] and our partner
[69:20] and you probably can hear a little bit
[69:23] that I don't go too deep into details as
[69:26] it's um or as this not just depends on
[69:28] me but also on our partners and but I
[69:32] can just say that um everything is open
[69:35] up you know or is more opening up um
[69:41] interest is starting to Surge and um
[69:46] this industry gets more attractive as we
[69:49] have special chips in our mining
[69:52] facilities that can provide this heat
[69:54] temperature which um other computers or
[69:58] data centers like AI cannot
[70:00] provide um so yeah from a business point
[70:05] I would say it was a first really really
[70:07] good P pilot project it's not even a
[70:09] pilot anymore it's really like a proof
[70:12] of concept and and it shows it's really
[70:15] working on an European level um we have
[70:18] the best up time from all facilities I
[70:20] ever saw um so we have 100% up time no
[70:25] no machines um are doing any or causing
[70:28] any problems accepted that on
[70:31] arrivals and now we are optimizing our
[70:35] investment structures so how can we
[70:37] onboard investors for future projects
[70:41] and um this will take a bit of time U
[70:44] we're working on that um we will finish
[70:47] this setup in January and then we are
[70:50] pretty ready to go to to approach the
[70:52] new projects um I think you'll see a lot
[70:56] of how can I say not advertisement but
[71:00] um at least we will communicate when we
[71:01] search for partners um institutional
[71:04] Partners um to get more and more foot
[71:07] into the door um or at least to bring
[71:10] Bitcoin mining or enhance the landscape
[71:12] in
[71:13] Finland and yeah I think um this is the
[71:18] this is the situation right now um
[71:20] regulational wise we already talked
[71:22] about that um no big issues um we are
[71:26] getting everything a little bit more
[71:28] slim the investing process and then we
[71:31] are ready to go and approach to new
[71:34] projects really cool perfect and I have
[71:37] one question that uh I asked each and
[71:39] every one of my guests is what can we
[71:41] learn from you besides Bitcoin I think
[71:44] it's always about and this has a lot um
[71:48] to do with my personal development I'm
[71:50] 26 years old oh no I recently turned 27
[71:53] I'm 27 years old I always I'm always one
[71:57] of the youngest um players on the table
[71:59] when it's about Bitcoin mining right um
[72:03] might it be in in China in in the US in
[72:05] Canada wherever and I never saw myself
[72:09] there I always wanted it I tried to
[72:12] attract this stuff um but I never saw
[72:14] myself there um but at least I took here
[72:18] and there I took a little bit risk and I
[72:21] was a little bit lucky and since then I
[72:25] can really feel that a lot of stuff
[72:26] changes in my personal life as well and
[72:30] I try to I try to meet everyone and
[72:33] every situation with kind of an open
[72:35] mind um because I know that every
[72:38] situation has its benefits it just
[72:40] depends on the point of view and I think
[72:44] this is something I would love to see
[72:47] people more and more doing um being more
[72:49] open to all kind of stuff and also
[72:53] attracting realiz that they can attract
[72:57] things by having the right let's say
[73:00] energy around them
[73:02] right very true yeah and I it's
[73:05] interesting because when I came into the
[73:07] space I thought I'm like someone in the
[73:10] middle range and now I actually see that
[73:15] I'm one of the youngest guys uh you just
[73:17] turned 20 uh 7 I just turned 26 and not
[73:21] just but like in September I turned 26
[73:24] uh so so it's uh it's interesting to see
[73:28] how mature uh the the Bitcoin Community
[73:31] already is uh and it's it's more of a
[73:35] maybe even like a problem that like
[73:36] under 20 year olds or under 25 year olds
[73:40] um don't have that financial problem yet
[73:44] too much uh so they like yeah like with
[73:48] the with the little money that I
[73:51] have I can gamble in some altcoins and
[73:54] cryptos schemes uh and because I don't
[73:58] have to be responsible and it's only
[74:01] when people become responsible that they
[74:04] turn to assets that actually make sense
[74:07] like Bitcoin uh and I saw that a lot of
[74:10] times when I see people that are only
[74:13] into crypto and not into Bitcoin uh they
[74:16] are usually younger they are usually
[74:19] um a little bit less responsible like
[74:22] they usually don't have family they
[74:24] usually don't have things to take care
[74:26] of uh and and then they let's let's AE
[74:30] into Doge like then it's of course it's
[74:33] easy uh if you don't uh if you have
[74:36] little money to play and uh nothing to
[74:38] lose uh and no responsible you don't
[74:41] have to put food for another person on
[74:42] the table or stuff like that maybe you
[74:44] don't even have to put food on your own
[74:47] table so that then it's easy to gamble
[74:50] uh and this what I kind of see in
[74:51] Bitcoin where we are a little bit more
[74:53] the mature crowd uh uh and we we are
[74:56] really integrating that now in the whole
[74:58] financial system and uh it's it's
[75:01] sometimes I feel a little off because
[75:04] I'm So Young uh but yeah 26 it's I'm I'm
[75:07] I'm getting there I'm soon getting the
[75:09] 30 years old my my beard is is growing
[75:11] so I'm I'm getting I'm soon soon be a
[75:14] little bit
[75:15] older yeah it's interesting what you
[75:18] what you just
[75:19] say and um we got a lot of applications
[75:24] right um every
[75:26] months and most of them are I would say
[75:30] something between 20 and 30 so there's a
[75:33] huge potential for companies as well um
[75:38] as soon if they as as soon as they apply
[75:41] for approach a Bitcoin strategy in their
[75:44] company that they can attract um really
[75:48] how can I say good um Human
[75:51] Resources um this is what I see
[75:54] personally and sometimes I'm like oh
[75:56]  this guy is more qualified for the
[75:58] job than I am
[75:59] so um you got a lot of good people in
[76:02] there but in general um you're
[76:04] completely right this industry is more
[76:07] about um people between 30 to 50 I would
[76:10] say um but it's going to be more and
[76:14] more for the younger people but it's
[76:15] still just more like that that um if you
[76:17] want to set up a company you need
[76:19] Capital right and in today's um time
[76:24] which 20- year-old got like a 100K 200k
[76:27] 400k to set up a company which is
[76:30] basically um going into mining right um
[76:34] this is something which is more for the
[76:38] older generation I would say but I can
[76:41] see a lot of pressure and a lot of
[76:43] interest of young people to to develop
[76:46] skills in that um sections to at least
[76:49] rush into the Bitcoin industry to work
[76:51] in the Bitcoin industry because I mean I
[76:54] I I saw this video where you actually
[76:56] described a little bit what how you came
[76:58] to that podcast right that you that we
[77:01] are recording right now and you just
[77:03] said oh yeah it was at Niko's podcast
[77:07] um and and you just said yeah I I had
[77:11] this wish to work for Bitcoin and then I
[77:14] just tried to to set something up and I
[77:17] was lucky as well a little bit maybe the
[77:19] algorithm just um played out well for me
[77:23] and you came up with this new form right
[77:25] you just do it which is crazy I mean
[77:29] crazy crazy you just upload every day
[77:31] right and um I can imagine you have a
[77:34] big backlog but I can also imagine it
[77:36] consumes a lot of time but this is
[77:39] actually your Niche and I think there's
[77:41] a lot of potential business potential
[77:43] not just in mining in content Creation
[77:45] in
[77:46] education and um yeah to all people that
[77:50] are still desperately searching for
[77:52] their job um in in the Bitcoin mining
[77:55] industry just stick to it um don't lose
[77:58] your hope I think it will come um just
[78:01] give us a little bit of time advocating
[78:03] for young people in the space and um
[78:07] bringing this industry um ahead that we
[78:10] need more people um we can see this
[78:12] already at our company that we are now
[78:15] in the process of setting up um a search
[78:18] um for for new people because we are
[78:21] growing um so it's good and yeah just
[78:25] stay
[78:27] positive there there's two things that I
[78:30] always say I always try to make make a
[78:33] gross because when you want to work in
[78:34] Bitcoin you basically have two things
[78:36] you can go towards the one thing is
[78:40] being an educator and that edu being an
[78:43] educator can be very prad you can
[78:45] actually be a teacher with me Prim
[78:47] Bitcoin you can be a content creator uh
[78:50] you can be podcast host you can be a Tik
[78:52] tocker whatever but you can also be a
[78:56] salesperson that has P2P clients with a
[78:59] big exchange that's also an educator he
[79:02] has a lot of the times the the the
[79:05] responsibility to educate people on
[79:07] bitcoin and take some fear away and
[79:09] stuff like that I imagine you also being
[79:11] an educator a lot of the times when you
[79:13] speak with clients uh so even sales I
[79:16] would consider to be an educator and
[79:19] then you have the other uh side of it
[79:21] where you have the developers no matter
[79:24] if that's like a Bitcoin
[79:26] mining uh site that you have to develop
[79:29] or like develop code for so some
[79:32] application or something like that where
[79:34] you actually do something technical or
[79:36] you do you try to to set something up
[79:39] those are the two things that you
[79:41] basically can do of course there are
[79:42] other jobs
[79:44] like you you you can be an an middle
[79:48] manager somewhere you can be in CFO for
[79:52] a company you can be uh Chief security
[79:55] officer in a in a Bitcoin
[79:57] company that's also really necessary I
[80:00] would not directly consider a Bitcoin
[80:02] job but it's a job in Bitcoin uh but
[80:07] yeah that that's that's where where I
[80:09] always go go towards like if if you if
[80:11] you're trying to figure out how to
[80:13] contribute to the Bitcoin Community try
[80:15] to figure out like what you actually
[80:16] want to do and maybe you already do
[80:20] something uh and you contribute that
[80:23] let's keep with that example of CFO
[80:24] maybe you're a CFO of a great company
[80:26] and you're doing an amazing job maybe
[80:28] there's a great com Bitcoin company that
[80:31] still needs an amazing CFO and maybe for
[80:35] you as a bitcoiner it's more fun to work
[80:37] for a Bitcoin company versus than other
[80:40] company I mean in the end of the day
[80:41] you're dealing with numbers and your job
[80:44] probably doesn't change a lot but it's
[80:46] it makes a difference uh for for what
[80:47] you're working for so I always encourage
[80:50] uh if you can go towards Bitcoin because
[80:53] we're in that small five to 10 year
[80:56] window where a new thing is completely
[81:01] created out
[81:02] of just like created a new industry
[81:05] where previously there was nothing uh
[81:08] and that's something really really um
[81:11] yeah aspiring to do at some point
[81:14] Bitcoin will be boring at some point
[81:16] Bitcoin will be not as uh uh amazing of
[81:20] an uh exciting of an an industry and
[81:24] then yeah there will be less Educators
[81:26] there will be uh less content creators I
[81:29] probably will not talk about Bitcoin
[81:30] when it's boring there's there will
[81:32] probably be some other topic then uh but
[81:35] till then it's a lot of fun and you
[81:37] should be involved as much as possible
[81:40] completely right I agree and I just
[81:42] recently you know since um The Bull Run
[81:45] started like one month ago I mean since
[81:48] yeah since the Trump election right and
[81:52] I really got addictive again to Bitcoin
[81:55] content I mean I'm basically you know
[81:56] I'm a Bitcoin nerd and I consume every
[82:00] evening about two to three hours of
[82:02] Market updates um all on YouTube um
[82:07] what's going on
[82:09] and someone just said isn't it
[82:12] incredible we are just witnessing these
[82:15] times um where we see the monetization
[82:18] of an asset we see an asset coming from
[82:21] zero being one of the most valuable
[82:24] assets
[82:25] um in the world if not the most valuable
[82:27] Assets in the world which I personally
[82:29] believe and this is has not been the the
[82:32] case for me this has not been the case
[82:35] for my mom this has not been Thea this
[82:38] this has not been the case for my
[82:40] grandmother you know assets have been
[82:42] there for a long long time stocks Gold
[82:46] Silver and now we are really witnessing
[82:48] how money flows into this asset and how
[82:50] it's growing and this is really
[82:53] something unique and and it's the same
[82:55] with this industry we see this
[82:57] completely new industry evolving um and
[83:01] I think there's a lot of space um for
[83:03] this industry and we're like with
[83:05] Bitcoin in the 197 like in 97 or
[83:09] something um which I personally believe
[83:12] we are now more in maybe 2001 2002
[83:16] um yeah during the internet or the
[83:19] beginnings of the internet there has
[83:20] always been that one guy in the company
[83:23] that has to sit on table put a modem
[83:25] there and doing some experiments and
[83:28] trying to get to the internet for the
[83:30] company right and I think we will see
[83:33] more and more people um in companies um
[83:37] at least pushing their company for a
[83:39] Bitcoin strategy and also see um Human
[83:44] Resources hiring people that someone at
[83:47] least can take off this uh care of this
[83:49] uh Bitcoin strategy as you need someone
[83:51] who's absolutely dedicated to it
[83:55] um and yeah I think this will come it's
[83:58] just the natural way how things go in
[84:00] the ecosystem of Bitcoin and that's
[84:03] basically the beauty of it because to
[84:05] its you know easiness how it's set up I
[84:08] mean not just on a technical basis but I
[84:10] mean the whole concept of Bitcoin is
[84:12] pretty easy and it's um how can I say
[84:16] once you're understood it never changes
[84:19] right and this lets us kind of assume or
[84:24] predict where things are going and I
[84:27] think we both are pretty convinced that
[84:29] Bitcoin is only going up not just in
[84:32] price but also in adoption in businesses
[84:35] that are evolving in jobs that are being
[84:37] created so I think there will be a lot
[84:39] of chance chances to to to get a foot
[84:42] into this industry absolutely and I
[84:45] fully agree with that thank you so much
[84:47] uh F been for being on Before I Let You
[84:50] Go oh we have the end routine still so
[84:52] before I let you go two things
[84:55] uh the end rtin where the previous guest
[84:57] is asking a question for the next guest
[84:59] without knowing who the next guest
[85:00] actually is and the question from the
[85:02] previous guest is a billion people flow
[85:04] into Bitcoin tomorrow what happens over
[85:06] the next couple of years he basically
[85:08] wanted to uh go in the in the fs towards
[85:13] what happens in a situation when a lot
[85:17] of freaking people all of the sudden try
[85:19] to join the Bitcoin Network um what will
[85:22] that do for the Bitcoin Network and the
[85:24] the Bitcoin industry over the next like
[85:26] two three years and we have like a first
[85:29] of all yeah so first of all I consider
[85:33] it it personally pretty important that
[85:36] we get as much as possible individual
[85:41] person persons into Bitcoin before it
[85:45] got sucked up by all the big
[85:47] institutions um from a capital
[85:49] perspective I think it's almost like one
[85:52] billion people would join tomorrow
[85:54] already so of course the first thing we
[85:57] are going to
[85:58] see um is the
[86:00] price uh price will Spike immediately it
[86:04] is spiking right now and I think it will
[86:06] go
[86:07] over 20k end of the
[86:10] year and when people ask me about the
[86:13] price um for next year I mean just like
[86:16] normal friends I I tell them you know
[86:18] you probably think I'm stupid but I can
[86:20] really imagine that we will see $1
[86:22] million next year um all this demand
[86:25] lining up um coming to this really
[86:28] really pretty pretty um small amount of
[86:30] Bitcoin left uh something around 1
[86:32] million
[86:34] right and I think it would be good if we
[86:37] can onboard as much people as possible
[86:39] before all the Bitcoin goes um going to
[86:43] to the big
[86:44] institutions um what else would happen I
[86:47] think um this will have a spillover
[86:49] effect because we all know that as soon
[86:51] as bitcoiners get get excited with
[86:54] Bitcoin but they are starting to talk um
[86:58] uh about Bitcoin all day long so other
[87:00] people will get orange pil so this would
[87:03] cause a NeverEnding wave of bitcoiners
[87:05] to
[87:07] cure and lastly I think um it would give
[87:12] Bitcoin a legitimization right um
[87:15] because many people want it many people
[87:17] are holding it um it would from a mining
[87:21] perspective for my businesses would be
[87:23] probably pretty good because transaction
[87:25] transaction fees would um would search
[87:28] as all people are trying to get their
[87:30] Bitcoin into self-
[87:32] custody um um so yeah I answer this
[87:37] question now more from a technical point
[87:39] of view than than a philosophical point
[87:41] of view I hope that's that's all right
[87:44] yeah absolutely I there is I think
[87:47] there's so much happening if that I
[87:49] think first of all I think I don't think
[87:51] that's happening uh um I mean it will
[87:54] happen that a billion people flow into
[87:56] Bitcoin but at a stage where there has
[87:59] been already a few billion people in
[88:02] Bitcoin uh where it's not like oh like
[88:05] now let's say the number is 150 million
[88:08] people or 200 million people are in
[88:09] Bitcoin depending on what metrics you're
[88:11] looking at we will not be tomorrow at 1
[88:16] billion uh people and 150 million uh so
[88:20] I think it's very unrealistic that we
[88:22] get there but if that actually happens I
[88:24] think the the the the fee will rise
[88:28] massively the price will rise massively
[88:31] uh all the industries all the fuse on
[88:35] all the videos like everything will just
[88:37] Spike immediately um would be super
[88:41] interesting uh and
[88:43] know something like that happens I
[88:45] probably just open up a 48 hour live
[88:48] stream yes exactly just like document
[88:52] everything that's happening and and
[88:53] don't sleep for a few the best life of
[88:56] your life because I cannot sleep anymore
[89:00] uh happens sometimes this day I also
[89:03] slept really badly because I was too
[89:06] excited uh for for Bitcoin uh but yeah
[89:09] it's it's uh it would be a massive event
