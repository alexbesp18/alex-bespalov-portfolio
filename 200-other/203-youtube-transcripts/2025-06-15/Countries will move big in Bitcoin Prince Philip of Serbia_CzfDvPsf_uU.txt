[00:00] what's holding most nation states back
[00:02] from adopting Bitcoin a group of small
[00:04] individuals who own a load of the
[00:07] world's wealth who will meet together to
[00:09] try and act in their own best interest
[00:11] that's what's holding back adoption for
[00:12] countries to make the decision to say
[00:14] yeah let's make it our legal currency
[00:16] but I don't think that's really a
[00:18] problem for Bitcoin it's basically just
[00:19] a matter of time the people and nation
[00:21] states and institutions and everybody
[00:23] involve figures out what Bitcoin is and
[00:25] how Bitcoin can help on an individual
[00:27] level on a nation state level I think
[00:29] you start to see some nation states
[00:31] making moves how long can this fear
[00:34] system still survive can this debt ever
[00:36] be paid off no it won't be paid off so
[00:38] there has to be some bubble that will
[00:40] pop when can we see a 100K Us doll
[00:43] bitcoin
[00:44] price before we get really into like the
[00:47] Bitcoin nation state adoption
[00:49] hyperbitcoinization what are you doing
[00:51] at the chree uh organization and in
[00:55] Serbia I always like to try start with
[00:58] your journey like how did you discover
[01:01] Bitcoin how did you had a shitcoin
[01:03] altcoin phe uh in your journey what was
[01:08] what is your motivation to be so engaged
[01:11] in the Bitcoin community so yes my first
[01:14] my first ever instance of uh discussing
[01:18] Bitcoin was actually back in
[01:21] 2012 uh and that was easily dismissed as
[01:25] magical inter internet money the the
[01:27] typical dismissal uh I was discussing
[01:30] with some friends I forgot exactly who
[01:32] it was but uh they were talking we were
[01:34] talking about oh yeah look at Bitcoin
[01:36] it's going up could it be going up to
[01:38] $100 or something what is this stuff I
[01:40] don't know yeah okay fine and then
[01:42] another conversation and it was always
[01:44] there in the background Bitcoin little
[01:46] you know it just didn't really show up
[01:49] hard on my radar I had no idea what it
[01:52] was or what it could do or what it was
[01:54] capable of completely dismissed it then
[01:59] 20 17 happened and I was on bitcoin
[02:03] Reddit actually and I saw
[02:06] that Bitcoin the uh the subreddit was uh
[02:11] was kept on posting that one meme of the
[02:14] of the of the guy of of
[02:16] the of the of the person that that
[02:19] little character on the roller coaster
[02:21] and he's keep kept and he's keep on
[02:23] going up and he's like you know hands in
[02:25] the air going woohoo you know going up
[02:27] and I was like that's that's that's
[02:28] interesting what's going on on there
[02:31] then I see this a couple of times I
[02:33] guess this is the beginning of this is
[02:34] at the end of 2016 beginning 2017 then I
[02:37] get a phone call from my uh from my best
[02:39] friend and he's like hey philli have you
[02:41] do you know do you know about Bitcoin I
[02:43] was like well yeah but what's up he was
[02:46] you should buy some I was like why it's
[02:48] a great hedge against inflation and and
[02:51] there there's only going to be 21
[02:52] million and that was as far as our
[02:53] knowledge my knowledge was of Bitcoin
[02:56] was all and it's just a good investment
[02:59] because could be the new future of money
[03:01] and stuff all right fine show me so he
[03:03] showed me he got me into coinbase
[03:05] coinbase accounts I bought some he told
[03:08] me to put into a wallet which was very
[03:10] nice of him but then I was asking him so
[03:12] what's uh what's ethereum and
[03:15] Litecoin because that's what they were
[03:17] selling also on coinbase at the time
[03:19] just of
[03:21] three and I bought I bought some of that
[03:23]  as well and I say some of that
[03:26] I'm I'm saying that Bitcoin is not
[03:28] I'm saying I bought those shitcoins
[03:31] thinking that they also stood a chance
[03:32] of being of having a
[03:35] future
[03:37] and yeah I guess I was distracted by
[03:39]  coiny my friend also got me
[03:41] involved uh on in in the Ico craze the
[03:45] initial coin offering phrase that was a
[03:47] big thing in the
[03:48] 2017 you saw so many people coming up
[03:51] with projects all these white papers all
[03:54] these
[03:55] um bril I say brilliantly yeah brilliant
[03:58] scams of of people people coming up with
[04:00] uh really well written um two or three
[04:04] pages of something like how that coin is
[04:06] going to save the world is how it's
[04:07] going to how it's going to you know save
[04:09] Dolphins from uh from from um from I
[04:14] don't know from the oceans and from
[04:16] humans and it's going to it's not going
[04:17] to boil this it's not going to it's not
[04:19] going to it's not we're you know we're
[04:20] going to have the new fastest
[04:22] transacting coin and it's going to have
[04:24] it's going to fix that un vulnerability
[04:26] it's going to create fix that security
[04:28] issue it's going to create this this
[04:30] speed and all that I wow look at all
[04:32] these amazing projects look all these
[04:33] smart people and they have these initial
[04:36] coin offerings you can get in there
[04:38] early you can probably get the next
[04:39] Bitcoin it's always about the next
[04:41] Bitcoin so I probably wasted I say loads
[04:46] of uh loads of my money back then but uh
[04:48] you know I was I was buying you know
[04:50] $100 here $100 there for these Ico
[04:53] tokens hoping that they would take off
[04:55] none of them took off so I learned the
[04:59] hard way
[05:00] there and I realized that icos were a
[05:02] load of
[05:03]  and that only just solidified
[05:08] my understanding that Bitcoin was the
[05:11] one The King and I remember back in 2017
[05:14] we created a group on whats up with some
[05:16] look some friends we got more friends
[05:18] involved in it and I remember Bitcoin
[05:21] was always to referred to as the king oh
[05:23] the king moves when the king moves
[05:24] everyone everything else moves and stuff
[05:26] so it's all it's all about Bitcoin but
[05:29] everyone was always getting cocked up
[05:30] about other shitcoins as well so we were
[05:32] all I said my group of friends were
[05:34] always were distracted by a lot of the
[05:36] shitcoin then it wasn't
[05:39] until 2020 okay sorry the bare Market in
[05:43] 2018 happened um
[05:46] I I was always always very heavy on
[05:50] holding Bitcoin I think I had like 80%
[05:52] of my portfolio 90% in Bitcoin and the
[05:54] rest was Litecoin and
[05:56] ethereum um uh because I thought that
[05:59] they could stand a chance you know I
[06:01] thought hey if they're on coinbase they
[06:02] they mean something um but I also saw
[06:06] that their Holdings got gradually worse
[06:07] and worse as the bare Market happened
[06:09] and Bitcoin just just stayed there doing
[06:11] its thing and just didn't you know it
[06:13] lost it it lost its price in Fiat but uh
[06:15] it was there it was doing its thing and
[06:17] I and I didn't really study further I
[06:19] did not study further much into Bitcoin
[06:21] at all I was distracted by my personal
[06:24] life you know I I had just got married
[06:26] my son was just born in the beginning of
[06:28] 200 uh
[06:30] 18 um but all the while whenever I got a
[06:32] paycheck or whenever this I would I
[06:34] would DCA or or or smash by whenever I
[06:37] had some some some some cash lying
[06:39] around only into
[06:41] Bitcoin then comes 2020 with the
[06:47] pandemic and that's when my eyes started
[06:49] to really open up I saw that having not
[06:54] been fully aware of what the reasons why
[06:58] and what actually happened during the
[07:01] 2008 2007 2008 2009 financial crisis or
[07:06] what was the cause of that I had my
[07:09] theories I had my ideas I was working in
[07:12] fi in traditional Finance in Asset
[07:14] Management I thought I knew why it was
[07:17] the case but you one thing is you don't
[07:19] question the money you don't actually
[07:21] question money to Theory you don't
[07:22] question what is money and this is what
[07:25] I started questioning in 2000 and that
[07:28] is what led me to
[07:29] um to joining my Bitcoin my my sorry my
[07:32] Bitcoin my Twitter account that was
[07:34] dormant since like 2010 I had some
[07:36] dormant bit uh Twitter account I joined
[07:39] on there I started following some uh
[07:41] some bitcoiners but also some crypto
[07:43] guys realized that the crypto the crypto
[07:45] um accounts were all cringe and they
[07:48] didn't really make much sense and they
[07:50] felt like a whole bunch of charlatans
[07:52] and scammers but the Bitcoin Maxis were
[07:55] making a lot of sense um not only were
[07:58] they in the there was intelligent uh
[08:00] discourse and some and some really great
[08:03] analysis and talk and you know and
[08:05] education from the likes of safine Gigi
[08:09] uh bit Stein and those people and then
[08:11] sailor came to the scene as well but
[08:13] there's some fantastic memes and humor
[08:16] and great posting that was
[08:18] happening and I thought that this is
[08:19] fantastic and I really it got to me it
[08:22] got to me and basically I was orange
[08:26] pilled I wouldn't say it was in an
[08:27] overnight process but it
[08:30] happened it happened sort of gradually
[08:32] over 2000 into 20 2021 when I took when
[08:35] I sold all the shitcoins I had which was
[08:38] not much um and just was like yeah I'm
[08:41] I'm a maxi now the
[08:44] worst there's no second
[08:46] best as as as per saor
[08:50] really so that's yeah yeah this is uh
[08:54] this era was amazing I think when you go
[08:57] back to like 2017 to 2018 around that
[09:00] time and search for Bitcoin only content
[09:03] it was quite hard to find I think I just
[09:06] came in 2020 uh so I don't know but this
[09:09] is what I hear a lot and now if you
[09:11] search for Bitcoin only content there
[09:12] are like so many podcasts there are so
[09:14] many good written pieces there are
[09:16] blocks out there there uh Twitter
[09:18] accounts that only post about Bitcoin
[09:21] it's amazing that there was not much
[09:23] before and I didn't if only I'd come
[09:25] across uh for example the Satoshi
[09:28] Nakamoto in intitute who started by pier
[09:30] rosard and
[09:32] bit and sorry if I'm not mentioning
[09:35] somebody else but uh I became close to
[09:38] recently to biten Michael
[09:40] Goldstein and their content was way
[09:43] ahead of its time they had the content
[09:46] but then a lot of people repurposed what
[09:48] they wrote obviously they made into into
[09:51] some guess they they they I want to say
[09:53] repurposed it recycled a little bit just
[09:55] to just to get more reach out there but
[09:57] there were a lot of good Pine iers in
[09:59] the space early Pioneers in
[10:02] 20112 who really understood what the
[10:04] implications of what Bitcoin was but
[10:07] that was hard to find you it would have
[10:09] been very difficult to find the satosi
[10:12] aomo Institute back if it back even
[10:15] 2017 but I think 2020 2021 that's when
[10:19] the the eruption of Bitcoin podcast
[10:22] material and then how I got my hands on
[10:26] the copy of the Bitcoin standard was in
[10:28] the late 20 20 I know it was written in
[10:31] 2020 2018 and I know it was Rewritten I
[10:35] the uh the forward was Rewritten because
[10:37] of uh the the the nas T um forward and I
[10:42] know that safe and and him have had a
[10:44] bit of a falling out for obvious reasons
[10:46] but I'm glad that I got the copy that
[10:48] has Sailors uh forward I read that book
[10:51] and that was I like wow that was that
[10:53] was a big heavy read that was like a
[10:55] that was a groundbreaking read I didn't
[10:57] take it didn't take me um
[11:00] I mean it took me a while I I was
[11:01] reading that book like every night for a
[11:04] for a couple of months it took me a
[11:06] while to get through it properly I
[11:07] really wanted to not just read it but
[11:08] study it and that was also part of the
[11:11] big Clincher of of of becoming orange
[11:13] build yeah this book I also read like it
[11:15] was also my first Bitcoin book and I
[11:18] also remember it took me I think one and
[11:21] a half months or something like that and
[11:23] I was also reading it almost every day
[11:26] and sometimes I just went back like 10
[11:28] pages and re read uh re uh rewrite the
[11:31] rad the whole 10 pages because I was
[11:34] like this does not make 100% sense I
[11:36] have to go back and read it again and
[11:38] then oh oh this is what it makes sense
[11:40] like yes exactly it's hard to understand
[11:42] the whole concept at at the first minute
[11:44] but that's what Bitcoin is it really
[11:46] changes you you look at the world as it
[11:49] should be the world that we've been
[11:51] brought up to indoctrinated in these
[11:53] days has has has given us a
[11:56] warped um vision and Vision sorry what I
[12:00] uh view of of the world and it's done
[12:04] that on purpose and Bitcoin recalibrates
[12:07] your your vision your your um your site
[12:11] and makes you see the world for what it
[12:13] is and we understand that money is the
[12:17] most it's it's the most fundamental
[12:20] property that we have for transaction
[12:22] for communication for information and
[12:24] that has been completely corrupted for
[12:26] um hundreds of years I mean I say
[12:28] hundreds of years since the the birth of
[12:29] C proper Central Banking you know the
[12:32] from the um um from the days of uh of
[12:35] Jackal Island but there was also also
[12:37] there was twink a lot of a lot of
[12:40] um Central Banking type Behavior and the
[12:44] and and and and deflation and debasement
[12:47] of currencies happening many many many
[12:49] years before Millennia before before the
[12:52] king of the the basements happen which
[12:54] was the the creation of f Federal
[12:56] Reserve and all the other central banks
[12:58] that were the result of that of that so
[13:01] yeah
[13:02] it's having to break through that
[13:08] that that education of yours is not easy
[13:12] and I'm going to understand we have to
[13:13] sympathize that a lot of people it's
[13:15] going to they're going to find it very
[13:16] difficult to uh to to to to to be able
[13:19] to see the world the way we see it now
[13:23] and maybe I might be sounding like a
[13:26] [Music]
[13:27] um like a what you call it like uh I
[13:30] forgot the words sorry uh I got to put
[13:33] it on pause but what's the word when you
[13:35] have a group of people Fanatics a
[13:38] conspiracy theorist are you seing for
[13:40] that yeah I've been I've been labeled
[13:42] that all the time that's normal that's
[13:44] that's that's about that's a badge of
[13:45] honor what's the other one doesn't
[13:47] matter we can continue crazy people okay
[13:50] not crazy people like
[13:52] the God sorry I should drink more coffee
[13:55] it's okay U it's it's interesting
[13:58] because uh I mean you're well known uh
[14:02] all over the world but uh especially
[14:03] also I think in in in syia uh as you are
[14:06] the in the royal family as you in the
[14:10] you are the Prince Philip of of Serbia
[14:12] how is the Bitcoin adoption going there
[14:15] and how do people and especially outside
[14:19] of Bitcoin react to to that well I
[14:23] wasn't I mean the the Serbian royal
[14:26] family which was actually last when it
[14:28] was functioning was Yugoslav royal
[14:30] family yes it was created as a serban
[14:33] royal family but it was abolished
[14:35] 1945 um as under the state of
[14:41] Yugoslavia uh we won't get get into the
[14:43] nitty-gritty details of that but um my
[14:46] father was born in 1945 in Exile in
[14:49] London and
[14:51] he uh married in
[14:54] 1972 married my my mother Princess uh
[14:58] Maria the Maria the Gloria Oran
[15:02] Brazilian princess who's also the heir I
[15:05] me Heir she's descendant of the last
[15:07] Emperors of Brazil the two only Emperors
[15:09] of Brazil one of them which was ped
[15:12] Segundo who was the one who paved the
[15:15] way for the liberation of slaves in
[15:17] Brazil and on my father's side it's the
[15:20] kovich dynasty which is a Serbian dasty
[15:23] he gajor who is my great times four
[15:26] grandfather he was the affu
[15:29] um pig farmer turn General who Who Rose
[15:32] up and led the first Uprising against
[15:34] the ultiman empire against us op ottoman
[15:38] oppression and so I'm quite proud to say
[15:41] that I come from two linages of of of
[15:45] Freedom
[15:46] Fighters and this is something maybe um
[15:49] I want to continue and I want to emulate
[15:51] and something I'm very proud of and
[15:53] maybe we can get onto onto the topic of
[15:56] moniki later on but yeah moving to
[15:58] Serbia recently I wasn't my father moved
[16:01] to Serbia in
[16:03] 202
[16:05] 2001 shortly after mosovich was oued and
[16:10] he and his wife lived I've been living
[16:15] ever since in the palace in Belgrade
[16:18] there's two palaces in the same
[16:20] compound and they have tried to do their
[16:24] work to try and promote the royal family
[16:26] my stepmother my father doing a lot of
[16:28] charity work but myself my older brother
[16:31] my twin brother have always kept
[16:32] separate from this um because my parents
[16:34] were divorced at at an early age so you
[16:38] know family problems we didn't want to
[16:39] get involved with um with having to deal
[16:43] with my father and stepmother relations
[16:44] we were closer to my mother and still
[16:47] close to my father but it was just it
[16:49] wasn't until actually I married my wife
[16:51] in 2017 and had our son in 2018 that I
[16:56] actually properly Got reestablished Back
[16:58] with my to my Serbian
[17:00] roots and this was part of also along
[17:05] the same time as my Bitcoin Journey what
[17:07] really opened my eyes up to um to what
[17:10] it is being a Serb and being an Orthodox
[17:13] Christian and it tied in actually quite
[17:16] well with the IDE with the philosophy
[17:18] with the ideology of of of um of
[17:22] individual sovereignty and also being a
[17:24] Bitcoin maximalist both I mean
[17:28] discovering Bitcoin has a spiritual sort
[17:30] of Awakening and the same idea was was
[17:34] also happening to me when I was
[17:35] rediscovering myself as a Serb and so
[17:37] when I moved to Serbia in during the
[17:40] pandemic and I moved in June
[17:43] 2020 um with my wife we decided to be a
[17:48] voice for for people we had a platform
[17:51] social media platform and we wanted to
[17:53] voice the concern of a lot of our people
[17:56] and to show that you know that you know
[17:59] we we we care and we want the royal
[18:01] family to to to to get back to maybe to
[18:03] the to to a position of of of having
[18:06] that not influence but a lot of people
[18:09] in Serbia and within the region have a
[18:10] lot of respect for the K family but at
[18:13] the same time a lot of that respect was
[18:15] also roded away thanks to the uh the
[18:17] Socialists or Communists during the
[18:19] years through prop propaganda but still
[18:22] there's a lot of serbs a lot of
[18:24] um very proud serbs who would love for
[18:28] the monarchy to be re uh re
[18:31] reestablished and it's not that it's my
[18:34] duty to to be the one to reestablish the
[18:36] monarchy my duty is to make to hopefully
[18:39] lay the groundwork for it to happen in
[18:41] one day in the future I have an issue
[18:44] that I don't speak Serbian fluently I
[18:46] only started learning properly in the
[18:47] last three years since I moved here and
[18:49] I I'll be I'll be honest it's a very
[18:51] tough language but I'm doing what I can
[18:55] my my wife is Serbian my son is speaking
[18:57] Serbian like like a like a Serb because
[19:00] his mother speaks to him in seran he
[19:01] goes to Serbian school here he's only 5
[19:03] and a half years old and then my
[19:06] daughter who just recently was born in
[19:09] November the 5th
[19:11] 2023 she she's uh she'll be she'll be
[19:14] Ser we we live we're living in Belgrade
[19:16] and I am changing what the car gorovich
[19:19] didn't have and that is the ability to
[19:22] live and being brought up in
[19:24] Serbia um after so many years of
[19:27] Exile so already that is trying to lay
[19:30] the foundations for uh for integration
[19:32] back of the korich dynasty into into
[19:35] Serbian culture and seran identity and
[19:37] this is something that we've been um
[19:39] some people insult us and this easy
[19:42] cheap Digs at the families that we don't
[19:44] speak Serbian that that we might be uh
[19:48] British spies MI6 we might be KGB we
[19:51] might be this and that yeah I understand
[19:52] that because we're foreign look at me I
[19:54] sound like a I sound like a British my
[19:57] my my back my background is that I've
[19:58] been living the UK most of my life and
[20:00] that's my accent um although my accent I
[20:03] wouldn't call it very 100% British and
[20:04] maybe somewhere a little bit more
[20:05] American in there as well but uh yeah I
[20:09] understand a lot that there's a lot of
[20:10] work that needs to be done for the re
[20:12] for the reiden identity to be restored
[20:14] for the British I mean for the British
[20:16] for the Serbian royal family and just
[20:20] like the bitcoiner that I am I
[20:22] understand about the actions of um of
[20:25] long-term planning long-term thinking so
[20:28] I've really had to lower my time
[20:29] preference and build a family which is
[20:33] something that I find very important
[20:34] these days because Serbia is going
[20:37] through a demographical nightmare like
[20:41] most uh countries in the west that have
[20:44] employed sort of liberal
[20:47] style policies and it's uh reproduction
[20:52] rate is only down at about 1.
[20:54] 1421 that means it's a dying nation that
[20:57] means in 40 30 years we won't have I
[21:00] mean in 50 years we won't have the
[21:02] Serbia that we have today and this is
[21:03] the case for many other uh Nations out
[21:06] there who have lost their ways of
[21:09] uh of um who have gone down the liberal
[21:12] that neoliberal route and lost that
[21:14] family value that their ways of of of
[21:17] strong identity of family values Serbia
[21:19] still has that but I believe the
[21:21] population in the cities have gone a
[21:24] little bit astray with with liberalism
[21:26] and I would love for so Serbia to uh to
[21:29] to um to regain
[21:33] its its position as uh as like it was
[21:37] back in the 1920s and 1930s before the
[21:41] second world war as as a very I would
[21:44] say powerful but independent and Rich
[21:46] asset building nation that was backed by
[21:50] gold gold back money but it was Fiat
[21:53] backed by gold and I have plans for it
[21:56] to be backed by by Bitcoin but that's
[21:59] another project down the line and I
[22:02] guess I'm rambling on over here but what
[22:04] I'm trying to say is that the change the
[22:06] reason I moved back to Serbia is because
[22:08] I wanted to get in touch back with my
[22:09] Serbian Roots but it's also I wanted to
[22:11] lay the groundwork for my for my
[22:13] children and their children and their
[22:15] children's children and to start
[22:17] something new from there and to and for
[22:22] the dynasty to be to be uh rejuvenated
[22:26] and reinstated in the way it should be
[22:28] and not from a
[22:30] foreign uh style introduction but more
[22:33] from a bottom up
[22:35] groundwork um uh Grassroots um strategy
[22:42] I say strategy um approach because I
[22:46] don't live in the palace I live downtown
[22:48] my wife and with and and our children go
[22:50] to my my son goes to school downtown as
[22:53] well and I go to the market we travel
[22:55] the country I don't have security I'm
[22:58] not part of any details here and there
[22:59] so what I'm trying to do is something
[23:02] that is uh has some risks but I think
[23:06] potentially in the long run has could
[23:07] have some some payoffs for for Serbia
[23:10] and it's it's it's uh its status as a as
[23:14] a freedom loving uh Sovereign um
[23:20] individual individual sovereign country
[23:24] it's it's amazing the the connection
[23:26] between like traditional value family
[23:28] religion how Bitcoin actually like IAL
[23:33] with a lot of Bitcoin as you're now my
[23:35] 35th guest uh and uh most of them that I
[23:39] interview have Traditional Values most
[23:41] of them are family fathers or want to
[23:44] build a family is depending on how old
[23:46] they are uh they have a strong
[23:49] connection usually with God and religion
[23:52] they have different religions but they
[23:53] all have a religious background they
[23:56] believe in something and the connection
[23:58] between that and Bitcoin is so
[24:01] fascinating because uh Bitcoin is such a
[24:04] young thing it's like such a a new
[24:07] modern thing that could be like really
[24:10] liberal uh but it's so connected to this
[24:13] Traditional Values to those family
[24:15] values and religion but I think at the
[24:18] same time Bitcoin can be liberal I think
[24:20] Bitcoin can appease to anybody and if
[24:22] you want to be liberal if you want to be
[24:24] independent if you don't want to have
[24:25] great family if you don't but but still
[24:28] adhere to a a monetary Network that it's
[24:30] that's
[24:31] Incorruptible and that that that
[24:34] promotes freedom and individual
[24:36] individual property rights then so be it
[24:38] you can do what you want really I guess
[24:40] that's the libertarian mindset but I
[24:42] think it tends to that if you are in
[24:45] that mindset already that you will tend
[24:48] to error on the F on the family side of
[24:50] things and tradition culture as you said
[24:53] religion and having relationship um
[24:57] having better relation ships with your
[24:58] community and and with God I guess yeah
[25:01] it's interesting because in the end of
[25:03] the day Bitcoin is just money like it's
[25:04] apolitical it has no values it's like
[25:07] there's no founder that says oh you have
[25:10] to vote for this and stuff and this is
[25:12] the best kind of state like there's no
[25:15] voice to it like there are so many voice
[25:17] to it but there's no voice to it if if
[25:19] you understand what I mean and it's it's
[25:22] it's just money in the end of the day
[25:23] but we see what Bitcoin can do with
[25:26] people and can also do with States like
[25:29] uh I mean in in kind of sense maybe for
[25:31] Serbia maybe for other nations it's like
[25:33] El Salvador maybe a role model for the
[25:36] na nation state adoption or how do you
[25:38] see that topic I've always used Salvador
[25:41] to role model um I think it's the the
[25:45] Salvadorian project is still it's still
[25:47] very young but it's showing great
[25:50] great
[25:51] results and I was there last I say last
[25:55] year now it's two years ago November
[25:58] 2022 and given that I speak Spanish I
[26:01] was actually speaking to some locals and
[26:03] they were all very happy with with B I
[26:06] wasn't talking about his about his his
[26:09] Bitcoin policy necessarily but about the
[26:11] other things that he's he's done and
[26:14] about cracking down on crime especially
[26:16] and and the gangs and and the positivity
[26:22] the the energy I got back from people
[26:25] was fantastic people were like
[26:29] like I've been tra I travel around Latin
[26:31] I've traveled around Latin America
[26:32] before and Latin American people always
[26:34] have a very positive nature uh um mood
[26:37] nature and they're very happy people but
[26:39] I just found that this what was
[26:40] happening in Old Salvador they just had
[26:42] an
[26:43] extra um an extra glean in their in
[26:46] their in their smile or something was
[26:48] fantastic I I I was really really taken
[26:50] back by it and how uh what what it means
[26:54] to them that that that five six years
[26:56] ago they were or maybe a little bit more
[26:59] they were the capital the murder capital
[27:02] um Salvador s Salvador the city was one
[27:05] of the murder capitals of the world and
[27:07] if you said that in 2015 that in uh that
[27:10] in six seven years from then it would be
[27:13] one of the safer cities safer cities of
[27:16] the world in in in Latin America you'd
[27:19] be like yeah you're crazy but no but
[27:21] they did it he did it because because B
[27:23] was
[27:24] Incorruptible and it took a B type
[27:28] character to do that but he understood
[27:30] what Bitcoin means and he understood
[27:33] what was needed and he only just enacted
[27:35] a law that was already in place in
[27:38] Parliament he just turned it into an
[27:39] emergency act and managed to round up
[27:42] all those gang members yes some innocent
[27:45] people got caught up in in in the in the
[27:47] process but that there are processes for
[27:50] them to be to be taken out but in
[27:53] general the payoff has been fantastic
[27:55] that now um GDP has gone up I'm can't
[28:00] give you the any figures but tourism as
[28:03] a result of Tourism has gone up trade
[28:05] I'm sure has gone up as well you know
[28:07] it's C it's one of the biggest uh better
[28:09] known coffee producers of the world I
[28:11] tried some fantastic coffees there I
[28:12] even picked some coffees there with
[28:14] Samson Mau um when we were hosted by uh
[28:17] Edward Rivas who's who was who's our
[28:20] director of of marketing he's he's
[28:23] Salvadorian and he has a very good
[28:25] coffee plantation in um in in one of the
[28:29] volcanoes and it overlooks one of the
[28:31] Lakes it's beautiful and samon you know
[28:34] this was during the be Market where we
[28:36] had to uh had to work for for our for
[28:38] our living and we started picking coffee
[28:40] coffee
[28:42] be um no but yeah El sa the El Sao
[28:46] example is something that I use when I
[28:48] write when I talk to people as well but
[28:49] I also use some other examples as well
[28:51] and uh one of them I say would be
[28:53] Switzerland I look at uh lug
[28:58] um and Canton Zoo Lugano because they
[29:01] actually have de facto adopted Bitcoin
[29:04] as some sort of legal T tender I won't
[29:07] be able to get into the nitty-gritty of
[29:09] the laws of what that means but you go
[29:10] to Lugano and they have a lot of uh
[29:13] Merchants that are accepting Bitcoin and
[29:16] that's fantastic this is in Lugano this
[29:18] is the third biggest uh financial
[29:20] service sector in city in Switzerland
[29:24] accepting Bitcoin in a country that
[29:27] probably has the least inflation in the
[29:28] world and has the highest G uh G&P per
[29:31] capita in the whole world so it's
[29:34] ridiculous that some country was not
[29:36] ridiculous it actually is logical they
[29:38] get it they understand and they
[29:40] understand that the future is Bitcoin
[29:42] and then I look at Canon zoo and Canton
[29:45] zoo is
[29:46] a tax Haven they've taken more of a
[29:50] neutral approach and they say Okay
[29:53] anything goes um but obviously we will
[29:56] tax you for it at a very very uh small
[29:59] amount and as a
[30:01] result I say Millions thousands of
[30:03] businesses especially hedge funds and
[30:06] some some crypto style and some Bitcoin
[30:08] businesses have moved to zoo and now
[30:11] cantong zoo is flourishing because of
[30:13] its um very relaxed tax law and I think
[30:18] the combination of those two of Lugano
[30:20] Zug are going to be setting a president
[30:24] for the rest of Switzerland as as I'm as
[30:27] I am aware that Switzerland the cantons
[30:29] can be very competitive with one another
[30:31] and that's a beautiful thing their
[30:34] decentralized nature means that it's in
[30:38] their interest to see who has the better
[30:40] system and because they have the
[30:42] actually one of the only examples of
[30:45] direct de democracy that actually works
[30:48] that the reason why Switzerland is isn't
[30:49] in a position is it is it in the
[30:52] position and then is it in today is
[30:55] because of that direct democracy that
[30:57] has not uh that hasn't broken yet so I
[31:00] would presume that you will get Canton
[31:03] burn and maybe uh Geneva at some point
[31:07] adhering to something similar to what's
[31:09] happening in Zug and Lugano and then I
[31:11] think Zurich will be the last one giving
[31:13] this size and prominence in the
[31:16] traditional financial markets but uh
[31:19] yeah Switzerland interesting interesting
[31:21] case study there given it's uh it's it's
[31:24] it's it's wealthy wealthy status stable
[31:27] status and um and neutral status another
[31:31] country that I like to look at is uh the
[31:33] United Arab arment and I believe the
[31:37] United Arab arment very similar to kind
[31:39] of what zoo has done is is taken this uh
[31:42] this tax Haven approach and have a
[31:44] neutral approach and say okay everything
[31:46] goes here obviously within reason but
[31:49] you know they have allowed businesses to
[31:51] flourish and now people are moving to to
[31:54] to United Arab marments and business is
[31:56] growing there
[31:57] also the add of benefit of United Arab
[32:00] amates is that they are an absolute
[32:02] monarchy and their family is very much
[32:05] tied to the success of the future of the
[32:09] United Arab arates so they have invested
[32:12] a lot of their money time and efforts to
[32:15] making sure that their country is
[32:17] successful not just in the next five
[32:19] years or six years or whatever it is
[32:21] like like a typical uh democratic
[32:24] election cycle but for the next 00 150
[32:28] years and this is something that you
[32:30] won't read much in the news you will
[32:31] read stories about oh yeah they
[32:32] overbuilt stuff they overbuilt buildings
[32:35] they they have too many office spaces
[32:36] that there are for for businesses and
[32:38] stuff but no I hear stories from from
[32:40] locals that Dubai is doing pretty well
[32:44] and they are looking to be set in in in
[32:48] the right direction for the next sort of
[32:50] 50 50 to 100 years
[32:53] and countries in the west would be
[32:56] incred be envious your your your
[32:59] Netherlands your Belgium's your your uks
[33:02] your swedens your norways and stuff they
[33:04] would be very envious of what would be
[33:06] what was what is happening in United
[33:08] Arab ARS United Arab ARS is not perfect
[33:11] I think they maybe embraced too much the
[33:13] whole feminism culture um because as a
[33:16] result too many women and please don't
[33:19] get me wrong I'm not not I'm not saying
[33:21] that feminism is a bad thing I think
[33:22] there's parts of feminism that will work
[33:24] but we understand where feminism's true
[33:26] causes is and that is trying to get more
[33:28] people into the workforce and trying to
[33:30] get kids into schools so they can be
[33:32] indoctrinated well I have news for UAE
[33:35] and sadly that their birth rate has gone
[33:37] down to about
[33:39] 1.47 and that is not replacing their
[33:41] culture but I'm sure the roal family are
[33:43] going to pick up on this and they will
[33:44] start to maybe incentivize women to stay
[33:48] home and do what uh they do best and
[33:51] that's the most important job in life
[33:52] the most fulfilling job in life and that
[33:54] is to be to be raising families and
[33:57] raising the next Generations and
[33:59] educating them
[34:01] and couple coupling this with uh with
[34:06] the ability to save in something like
[34:08] Bitcoin gold even as well I would be I
[34:11] would be an advocate of but obviously
[34:12] Bitcoin far superior that these families
[34:15] are able will will be able to do this
[34:17] and you will see their birth rate go
[34:21] back up up up to the the the ideal 2.1
[34:24] which replaces and grows uh popul
[34:27] I'm super excited to announce that this
[34:30] podcast just got the first ever sponsor
[34:34] I just started the podcast out like
[34:36] three months ago and now we have 21
[34:40] Bitcoin as a partner for this podcast 21
[34:44] Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one and
[34:48] they teach and preach self custody this
[34:51] is my goto exchange when someone asks me
[34:55] oh where can I buy my Bitcoin Co from
[34:57] this is the easiest entry for bitcoiners
[35:01] and if you want lower fees Plus at the
[35:04] same time support this podcast use code
[35:07] Robin and click the link in the
[35:09] description there are so many uh things
[35:12] uh in there what you just uh said like
[35:14] the first with El Salvador I just spoke
[35:16] like a week ago with a couple that moved
[35:19] two years ago to El
[35:20] Salvador uh and they told me that when
[35:23] they first got to there most shop owners
[35:26] had like
[35:27] um guards in front of their shops and
[35:31] most of their guards are now gone
[35:33] because they don't need it anymore like
[35:35] some still have it like in the the count
[35:38] got so much safer and also Switzerland
[35:42] having is is a really funny state
[35:45] because as you said it's like the lowest
[35:47] inflation they have a really sound
[35:49] financial system uh compared to all the
[35:52] other countries uh and still they get
[35:55] Bitcoin and it's just because of that I
[35:58] think because they're getting uh the
[36:00] financial system and they know how to
[36:02] handle it that they are getting Bitcoin
[36:05] and then we're getting back to all all
[36:07] the values and it's it's kind of all
[36:08] connected like the security of the of
[36:11] the state the sound financial system the
[36:14] the traditional family family values
[36:16] because if we don't have the traditional
[36:17] Family Family Values we die out at some
[36:23] point if we don't get well the West the
[36:26] West is dying I'm afraid to say and I'm
[36:29] have to say that it's it's worse in some
[36:31] PLS than other I consider maybe s uh the
[36:34] bulans as part of the West because I
[36:37] mean if you draw you have to draw a line
[36:38] somewhere but they have been sucked
[36:41] their their demographics has been sucked
[36:44] dry from from the actual West because we
[36:47] have high quality labor we have educated
[36:50] people and when these guys when when our
[36:52] when serbs when macedonians slovenians
[36:56] slovenians so their country is a bit
[36:57] much more stable but croatians bosnians
[37:01] when they get educated they just want to
[37:03] move abroad and that's just making the
[37:05] situation worse yeah my my job as well
[37:09] sorry to to to to interrupt you but my
[37:11] job is U um Mission as well back in
[37:15] Serbia is my wife and I were opening up
[37:17] a foundation which is the hereditary
[37:19] Prince philli and uh princess Dan a
[37:21] foundation Ro foundation and we one of
[37:25] the things that we' be working on is
[37:27] trying to reverse this brain drain and
[37:29] trying to get people to stay here and to
[37:31] create
[37:32] opportunities um where jobs are created
[37:35] and people won't need won't have the
[37:37] need to leave and actually that we want
[37:40] to have a reverse and have a net out in
[37:43] migration so yeah it's a tall order but
[37:46] we got to start somewhere that's that's
[37:48] a great Mission I think and uh and if if
[37:52] we summarize everything we just said
[37:54] like maybe in the last 10 minutes and we
[37:57] coming to the conclusion that like
[37:58] Bitcoin is a really good idea and there
[38:00] are already examples in Nations like
[38:03] Salvador and and and Switzerland where
[38:05] it's like kind of implemented and it
[38:08] goes really well what's holding most
[38:11] nation states back from adopting Bitcoin
[38:14] like what's what's the thing that has to
[38:16] happen in the next like 50 years for
[38:18] people for Nations to adopt Bitcoin it's
[38:20] a very very good question I think fear
[38:24] doubt and
[38:25] uncertainty I think you know the world
[38:28] uh
[38:30] the you saw what happened
[38:34] during Co when all the countries most
[38:38] the countries in the world acted in lock
[38:40] step when they started locking down
[38:43] economies telling people to wear masks
[38:45] and then asking to stupidly get
[38:48] vaccinated was something that's
[38:51] experimental that is what we're up
[38:53] against
[38:55] and there are forces out there and
[38:58] people say oh you're conspiracy theorist
[39:01] you know there's no such thing as a
[39:02] cabal people controlling the world well
[39:04] no actually it's just pure logic of
[39:07] course there's a group of small
[39:08] individuals who own a a load of the of
[39:12] the world's wealth who will meet
[39:14] together to try and act in their own
[39:16] best interest th that's what's holding
[39:18] back pure
[39:19] adoption um that's what's holding back
[39:22] adoption for countries to make the
[39:24] decision to say yeah let's make it our
[39:26] legal currency I mean our our legal
[39:29] tender and stuff but I don't think
[39:31] that's really our a problem for Bitcoin
[39:33] I think
[39:34] Bitcoin we at gen 3
[39:37] are understand that Bitcoin is a
[39:40] bottomup I see Revolution let's say
[39:43] bottomup strategy it's a Grassroots
[39:44] strategy you can't stop it from um from
[39:47] growing it's decent completely
[39:49] decentralized it's like the melium of
[39:52] the forest it's just going to grow you
[39:54] cut off one chunk it's just going to
[39:55] grow even stronger or somewhere else you
[39:57] saw that with the case study of of China
[40:00] Banning its mining which was a fantastic
[40:03] thing next thing you know mining became
[40:04] even more decentralized it's the it's
[40:07] it's the 10he headed beast that you cut
[40:09] off one head and 20 more heads come out
[40:11] it's
[40:12] fantastic well I think countries smaller
[40:16] countries more agile
[40:18] countries and not your big G7 or G20
[40:23] whatever gpack countries are the ones
[40:26] that not going to be they're not going
[40:27] to be the ones adopting Bitcoin in any
[40:29] short shape or form they might be using
[40:31] it here and there they might be uh
[40:33] accepting it to some extent there and
[40:35] here but the ones who properly um adopt
[40:37] it are the ones are the are the smaller
[40:40] countries who have been hard done by uh
[40:42] trade situations and capital controls
[40:45] and EC and and being hard died by the
[40:48] dollar so I'm looking mainly towards
[40:50] Latin America you know we were recently
[40:53] Samson and Ben were recently in Surinam
[40:56] um they have bad inflation there it's in
[40:58] the 50 60% um and but there are
[41:02] politicians there there's groups of
[41:03] politicians there who are waking up to
[41:05] the fact that Bitcoin can save can help
[41:07] save their situation they have they're
[41:09] energy rich country and maybe they can
[41:12] um they can do work something with uh
[41:15] with with mining Bitcoin but also
[41:17] there's maybe talk about them trying to
[41:19] put like a buy one or two% of of their
[41:23] of their of their of their reserves on
[41:25] on with Bitcoin um I'm seeing we're
[41:28] seeing interests of other countries
[41:30] around El Salvador Costa Rica Guatemala
[41:35] um uh El Salvador
[41:38] Panama we've seen these countries
[41:40] looking at at El Salvador is thinking
[41:44] yeah I kind of we kind of want to sort
[41:46] of see that happening within our borders
[41:48] too but the problem is that those
[41:51] countries have different governance
[41:52] models and with different governance
[41:55] models comes different
[41:56] strategies so I don't think you'll get
[41:59] auk anytime soon and auk is it's a very
[42:03] it's an outlier in terms of um yeah he's
[42:07] an outlier in terms of how what he did
[42:09] and how he did it and and if it will
[42:11] ever be
[42:12] replicated I think you'll have you'll
[42:15] have more process um you'll have the
[42:18] more democratic I'm not saying that El
[42:21] Salvador is not Democratic it is it just
[42:23] happens that he has 90% approval so
[42:26] people perceive him as a as a
[42:27] dictatorship but whatever he has 90%
[42:30] approval and he's doing good for the
[42:31] country but say say for example like
[42:33] somewhere like Costa Rica where they say
[42:35] they have one of the most developed
[42:37] democracies in the world comparable to
[42:39] Switzerland then you got to say all
[42:41] right well that's that's going to be an
[42:43] absolute challenge how many hoops and
[42:47] and and and and and and and sort of uh
[42:52] hoops and boundaries you have to go
[42:53] through in order for for for for Bitcoin
[42:55] to to happen so I
[42:58] think the smaller country so I'm going
[43:00] back to saying the smaller countries
[43:02] that are have some sort of energy um
[43:05] ability to to to uh to use energy to
[43:08] mine Bitcoin I think that's going to be
[43:10] one of the causes for for adoption I
[43:13] think
[43:14] that that giving that energy is the most
[43:17] important sector in in the world I mean
[43:21] without energy nothing really works and
[43:24] right now energy is is is under a 51%
[43:27] attack I would say thanks to globalist
[43:30] policy ideology of this climate scam so
[43:33] I think this there will be a push back
[43:36] from rational people like bitcoiners who
[43:40] understand that you can actually use
[43:42] Bitcoin and this is also proven right
[43:45] by Papers written by the big big four
[43:49] accounting companies namely KPMG proving
[43:52] that Bitcoin is the ultimate one of the
[43:55] ultimate ESG assets and tools that we
[43:58] have out there and can actually help the
[44:01] climate not that the climate actually
[44:03] needs helping well that's another top
[44:06] conversation but I think that uh energy
[44:09] is going to be play a big part in uh in
[44:11] in in countries adopting uh Bitcoin to
[44:13] in some shape or form you saw what
[44:16] happened in um in the Kingdom
[44:19] of
[44:21] Aman I think it's a man excuse me if I
[44:25] if no it's not
[44:26] man Kingdom man recently at end end of
[44:29] uh summer last year was around May or
[44:32] June last year they actually have
[44:36] invested 1.1 billion into into mining
[44:39] Bitcoin because they're energy rich and
[44:41] they realize that money is energy and so
[44:43] they're starting to connect ad dos and
[44:45] now that're that's that sort of those
[44:47] Investments small countries like that
[44:49] that have some sort of energy who want
[44:52] in to be
[44:54] independent will start to start to to
[44:57] move into Bitcoin in that sort of way or
[44:59] form so I'm going to ramble on and say
[45:01] that for example here in Serbia my I and
[45:04] and within the region my ideal strategy
[45:06] over here was that I don't see that
[45:08] Bitcoin as a currency taking off quite
[45:11] yet people here are a little bit too
[45:12] skeptical of Bitcoin they associate too
[45:15] much of something being of something
[45:16] digital even though it's not really
[45:18] digital it's actually more electronical
[45:20] but they see it maybe something like as
[45:22] control like a cbdc and uh and it's
[45:24] going to take away your freedom and all
[45:26] that and they are very cash orientated
[45:29] and they they're very much about their
[45:32] you know hoarding cash under the
[45:33] mattresses but they don't then they
[45:36] realize that that cash is being eroded
[45:38] at 10% inflation every year and it's
[45:40] only going to get worse but uh for
[45:45] example Serbia has incredible capacity
[45:48] for geothermal
[45:50] energy and thanks to
[45:53] bitcoin sorry that it's Capac capacity
[45:56] is not
[45:58] very easily accessible it requires a lot
[46:01] of investment but thanks to bitcoin that
[46:04] will actually and Bitcoin mining that
[46:06] would could actually reduce the time and
[46:08] the efforts and the cost of
[46:10] actually um extracting that energy and
[46:14] providing it to the millions of homes
[46:16] that are needed to heat to be heated
[46:17] over winter and be cooled over summer in
[46:20] Serbia and therefore gaining energy
[46:23] independence from the likes of of of of
[46:26] Russia which we have great relationship
[46:28] to Russia but that's under threat thanks
[46:31] to certain Uh current geopolitical um um
[46:36] Dynamics but wouldn't it be great if
[46:39] Serbia just decides okay let's focus on
[46:41] our geothermal capacity let's start
[46:43] let's start drining some holes here and
[46:45] there and if these don't actually
[46:46] destroy the environment and now we have
[46:49] hot water Springs because we have so
[46:50] many hot water Springs that these hot
[46:52] water Springs can now be bringing hot
[46:54] water to to heat homes all all in some
[46:57] areas and then that hot water can be
[46:59] used to create energy that can mine
[47:01] Bitcoin that will then make money to
[47:02] then pay for roads and for services and
[47:04] then we can lower people's taxes and
[47:06] then improve the people's uh cost of
[47:08] living and all of a sudden Energy prices
[47:10] go down year over year and then people
[47:12] will come over because of the of the
[47:14] stability and investing into the country
[47:17] it's just the multiply effect it just
[47:18] makes so much sense but it takes it just
[47:21] takes a bit of time and understanding so
[47:24] I think education is another big part of
[47:27] it as I said before fear doubt and
[47:29] uncertainty and I think that fear is a
[47:31] big is a big thing the fear of the
[47:33] unknown you know the internet in the n
[47:36] in the in the early 90s was a big fear
[47:38] for a lot of people I got to say I me I
[47:40] I was I wasn't I was young but I was
[47:42] like you know what is this stuff this
[47:44] you know what is this internet stuff you
[47:45] know there's books there's uh there's TV
[47:48] there's radio but then look what happens
[47:50] look what happened to the Internet it's
[47:51] incredible um so I think there will be
[47:54] an inflection point when people will
[47:56] start to understand that uh that Bitcoin
[47:59] is that base layer of money and there's
[48:03] so much stuff that can be done so much
[48:05] utility that can be done on top of it
[48:07] through different layers and through
[48:08] Mining and through and through what just
[48:11] Bitcoin does that's going to change the
[48:12] world for the better yeah true it's it's
[48:15] it's basically just a matter of time
[48:17] till people and nation states and
[48:19] institutions and everybody involved uh
[48:21] figures out what Bitcoin is and how
[48:23] Bitcoin can help on an individual level
[48:25] on a nation state level on an
[48:27] Institutional level and it's it's I
[48:30] think it's crazy how far we already got
[48:33] with founder of Bitcoin going away after
[48:36] one year basically and saying yeah let's
[48:39] let's live let's Let It live on and it's
[48:42] good enough already and now public
[48:45] companies have adopted it nation states
[48:47] adopting it it's getting legal tender
[48:49] status it's it's it's crazy and it's I
[48:50] think it's a really good thing uh to be
[48:53] involved in and maybe maybe coming back
[48:56] to chre and nation state adoption like
[49:00] we covered already a lot of countries
[49:03] now uh and but I see you and and Sam Mau
[49:06] and and other people from chrey going a
[49:09] lot on to a lot of different countries
[49:11] meeting with people meeting with
[49:13] presidents um what's the current state
[49:16] uh of of nation states what could be the
[49:19] the next Nations that adopt Bitcoin on a
[49:21] legal standard legal tender basis what's
[49:24] the what's the current Outlook right now
[49:27] the current Outlook is look it's not I
[49:29] wouldn't say it's hot but it's
[49:32] going with the coming bull market then
[49:35] it will it will speed up we have
[49:36] conversations you know we saw us in um
[49:39] in seram and Colombia I was also we were
[49:43] also recently in in Montenegro so I
[49:46] think you'll start to see some nation
[49:48] states um making moves into Bitcoin in
[49:52] different shapes and forms as we talked
[49:54] about before and I think namely energy
[49:56] but also maybe allocating their um some
[49:59] of their their their reserves into
[50:01] Bitcoin but and to the point of actually
[50:03] accept uh accepting it as as legal
[50:06] tender um I won't I can't and I can't
[50:10] disclose what what what I so I don't
[50:13] have the information I don't have the
[50:15] the crystal ball but uh I would to say
[50:17] that I think later this year you will
[50:19] see you should see some nation states
[50:22] making some uh I say bold bold
[50:26] because um that's how let's say uh the
[50:31] mainstream we'll call it but I'd say mo
[50:34] but also bold in our world as well
[50:36] because it is still a risk at some
[50:38] respect that you know if you're a first
[50:40] mover you are still taking some risk but
[50:43] they will be rewarded they will be
[50:45] handsomely rewarded these will be strong
[50:48] bold moves just like B is has done and
[50:51] and how Michael saor did with uh in the
[50:54] in the corporate world so yeah I think
[50:57] there's going to be there's going to be
[50:58] a lot of there's going to be a lot of
[50:59] activity in the second half of this year
[51:02] and then and then going into next year
[51:04] and we have more meetings with uh with
[51:07] more countries uh later this year and
[51:10] you know for for example Montenegro we
[51:12] have speaking to speaking to a couple of
[51:14] very intelligent Montenegro and
[51:16] bitcoiners who have some great plans
[51:18] have uh lined up there so it's it's
[51:22] exciting it's really exciting um I don't
[51:25] want to first everyone's bubble and say
[51:26] yeah it's going to happen you know all
[51:28] countries are going to start piling into
[51:29] it you know there's going to be a big
[51:30] rush to to to to Global adoption and
[51:33] stuff no but it will happen bit by bit
[51:36] and that's still old saying is gradually
[51:38] then suddenly um so yeah and how do you
[51:42] see if like more and more countries now
[51:44] adopting Bitcoin and and like for me
[51:47] personally I adopted a full Bitcoin
[51:49] standard I still have to pay most things
[51:52] in feat currency because it's not
[51:54] otherwise uh possible but I always try
[51:57] to be at like zero feeld and if more and
[52:00] more people do that and if more and more
[52:02] even nation states starting to do that
[52:05] and we having like if we take 9071 as
[52:09] like the the the complete beginning of
[52:12] the Fiat standard of course it was there
[52:14] before but then 1971 it it really like
[52:18] kind of took off the Fiat standard uh it
[52:20] already survived more than 50 years how
[52:24] long can this feared system still
[52:27] survive will it always survive can it
[52:29] survive another 50 hundred years well as
[52:32] you're saying right now for its survival
[52:34] to happen it it it seems to be that the
[52:37] it's Earth the the depth is just only
[52:40] going to get greater and greater
[52:42] so can it be paid can this debt ever be
[52:45] paid off no it won't be paid off so
[52:48] there has to be some bubble that will
[52:50] pop I mean some bubble that bubble will
[52:52] have to somehow come down and be popped
[52:55] and I don't see it's mathematically
[52:57] possible to uh to repay that debt
[53:00] because that debt is just get getting
[53:01] worse and worse um then you have to ask
[53:04] the question so who would then take the
[53:06] role as G Global Reserve
[53:09] asset and this is people been talking
[53:12] about brick countries um maybe one of
[53:15] those countries standing out and saying
[53:17] yes I'll I'll I'll I'll be that Global
[53:19] Reserve but I don't think any any one of
[53:21] those countries want to be Global
[53:22] Reserve I think they might want to have
[53:24] more dominance with a currency but you
[53:27] have to remember that a global Reserve
[53:29] currency has to also uh print money and
[53:34] to export money so they will have to
[53:36] then also become a net importer of goods
[53:40] in order to balance those trade this is
[53:42] known as the Griff bels I forget it was
[53:44] perian Bull who taught me who taught me
[53:46] this uh he's great account to listen to
[53:49] and I heard him on a podcast saying that
[53:51] um the Griffin dilemma Griffin dilemma
[53:54] is that uh you would have to print you
[53:58] you'd have to if you're an net exporter
[54:01] of goods like most of these brick
[54:03] countries are Brazil Russia India
[54:07] China and um and South Africa they
[54:11] export more than they import but then if
[54:13] you become a reserve currency you will
[54:17] have to start exporting your currency so
[54:20] in order to stop runaway inflation you
[54:22] will then have to start importing more
[54:24] Goods than your exporting so I don't see
[54:26] those countries starting to import more
[54:28] Goods um so that's the Dilemma this is
[54:31] what America was able to pull off for
[54:33] many years is that they are a
[54:35] consumption country and they can consume
[54:38] more than they can they actually consume
[54:40] more than they uh than they export to to
[54:43] some extent so they're able to balance
[54:45] that not to say that it was perfect but
[54:47] they uh they're now running away from
[54:50] that that that that that that dilemma is
[54:53] catching up with them so
[54:55] and then the bricks would consider them
[54:57] maybe putting together a basket of of of
[55:01] of of currencies or maybe Commodities
[55:04] together to to be to for for money to be
[55:06] backed by that but I think over time you
[55:09] know trust is the issue of it here is
[55:11] like um you know brick countries are
[55:14] brick countries they uh they've got big
[55:16] economies growing economies but uh let's
[55:19] say the politics in those countries is
[55:20] always instable so trust is always going
[55:23] to be an issue
[55:25] and so if trust is an issue what is
[55:28] there out there that doesn't need trust
[55:30] that's trustless and you can verify then
[55:34] that's Bitcoin so I think there will be
[55:38] a a point where those bigger of the of
[55:42] the of the of the of the brick style
[55:45] countries and your turkeys and your
[55:46] Argentinas and people like that will
[55:49] then realize okay well actually I think
[55:51] it's about time that we we uh We join
[55:53] this trustless system
[55:56] and yeah so I'm I'm very bullish about
[55:59] Bitcoin in in in the in the very long
[56:01] term so yeah yeah game theory is
[56:04] definitely
[56:06] starting to to come along and and and
[56:09] take it's G to come it's going to come
[56:11] very suddenly but right now it's very
[56:13] gradually so I mean what we do at Gen 3
[56:15] is we go and plant seeds around the
[56:17] place and we go try and try and get
[56:19] introductions to governments around the
[56:20] world we've SP spoken to a lot of
[56:22] politicians leaders um
[56:25] even just influential people and just
[56:28] try to orange pill them and people get
[56:30] it people I say people get it some
[56:31] people don't get it and but but planting
[56:35] that seed of education and it's I think
[56:40] there will be a point and I think that
[56:43] given how the world is on is Works under
[56:47] under political cycles and right now
[56:50] we're sort of at the end of a geop
[56:52] massive geopolitical cycle I think there
[56:54] will will be an inflection point where
[56:56] something massive takes off maybe in the
[56:59] terms of the bricks trying to organize
[57:01] together with some Global Reserve
[57:04] currency backed by by by some
[57:06] Commodities or or one of them wanting to
[57:08] maybe China saying oh no I want to take
[57:10] the stand over here but I doubt that's
[57:12] going to happen but then there will be a
[57:14] movement towards Bitcoin afterwards I'm
[57:17] being very hope hope optimistic and
[57:20] very idealistic but uh I I think that
[57:23] we're we're only a matter of a few years
[57:25] away from that and also given that also
[57:28] people are living right now through the
[57:30] through some of the worst uh inflation
[57:33] um cost of living crisises in in In
[57:36] Living Mar since the 1970s this is
[57:39] something that's not just experienced in
[57:40] countries like um like like like
[57:42] Venezuela Lebanon and uh and
[57:47] and oh other high inflation countries
[57:50] turkey and places like that but I think
[57:52] that other countries who've now had who
[57:54] have had now experienced double digit
[57:56] inflations UK Serbia included America
[57:59] was almost up there but I believe it was
[58:01] up there it's just the way they
[58:02] manipulate their their
[58:04] statistics um that now people are
[58:06] suffering people are hurting and so so
[58:10] that education of Bitcoin is going to be
[58:12] it's gon it's going to move it's gonna
[58:15] it's going to move very quickly that's a
[58:18] I think that's a a great Point uh to
[58:21] come to our end routine uh that Bitcoin
[58:23] will move and Bitcoin will have a full
[58:26] flashed adoption in like the the near
[58:29] and long-term future uh for and for
[58:32] everybody that is on a low time
[58:34] preference Bitcoin standard I think it
[58:36] it will pay off
[58:39] heavily um and we having an end routine
[58:41] in the podcast where the previous guest
[58:43] asks a question for the next guest uh
[58:46] and this an interesting one I think a
[58:49] question that a lot of people with a
[58:51] shorttime horizon usually think about uh
[58:55] I don't care about the question too much
[58:57] but I still want to ask it because it
[58:58] comes from the previous guest when can
[59:00] we see 100K US dollar bitcoin
[59:07] price 100K I I mean you are in contact a
[59:10] lot with Samsung ma who thinks know I
[59:13] think the question should be we see uh 1
[59:17] million us do
[59:19] Bitcoin yeah you can remodel the
[59:21] degression for million no I think 100K I
[59:24] think 100 is a lot is a lot closer than
[59:26] we think yes so I think uh I think by
[59:29] the end of the year let's say yeah I say
[59:32] by octob OAS I'm going to put a date
[59:34] there I'm not into this I'm not into
[59:36] that playing that anymore that's what I
[59:37] used to do back in the days when I Was
[59:39] An Old Co shitcoin all coin but I'm
[59:41] going to say October
[59:43] 2024 we'll see 100K yeah I also think
[59:47] it's is really difficult for Bitcoin not
[59:49] to hit 100k this year but of course but
[59:52] also I'm really young with 25 five so I
[59:55] actually want Bitcoin to stay as low as

[62:26] around uh Austria Germany Serbia all of
[62:29] Europe basically it would be amazing to
[62:31] find more I just want to have ones to
[62:33] invite locals to to understand and learn
[62:35] more about what Bitcoin is and to try
[62:37] and um squash
[62:40] those those misconceptions that really
[62:43] are still P still uh holding a lot of
[62:46] people back from understanding what
[62:47] Bitcoin is but also there's a lot of
[62:49] work that needs to be done in terms of
[62:50] how to actually buy and acquire and hold
[62:52] Bitcoin you know we have buying we have
[62:54] Kraken we have ecd which is an exchange
[62:57] run by a good friend of mine friend of
[62:59] mine here but uh it's always the quest
[63:03] of trying to make user experience easier
[63:05] and and knowledge better so people are
[63:08] able to get onto the Bitcoin standard
[63:10] and able to protect their hard earned
[63:12] money in the easiest safest best way
[63:15] possible for their circumstances so yeah
[63:19] that's the quest that's what Bitcoin is
