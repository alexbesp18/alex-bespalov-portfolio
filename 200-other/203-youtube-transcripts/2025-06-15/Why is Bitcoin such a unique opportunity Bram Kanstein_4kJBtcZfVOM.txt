[00:00] Bitcoin solves an actual problem sat
[00:02] nakoto left really early for startups
[00:05] and new businesses actually the founders
[00:07] have to do all the work in the beginning
[00:09] but yeah when you compare that to
[00:10] Satoshi who left very very early on it's
[00:13] actually pretty incredible I never
[00:15] thought about that uh before it should
[00:17] not work in that way for the philosophy
[00:19] of what Bitcoin could be he had to go
[00:22] and then after that launch I was like
[00:23] damn I'm I'm an idiot I'm working at a
[00:25] bank I'm working at a goddamn bank and
[00:27] I'm participating in a system I have a
[00:29] mortgage I have a bank account and I'm
[00:30] I'm participating in system that I truly
[00:32] do not understand how Wild is that if we
[00:34] only trade in the hardest money to ever
[00:36] exist
[00:37] then how can you determine a good idea
[00:41] and a bad idea and the Bitcoin related
[00:44] question is like why is Bitcoin such an
[00:47] amazing idea through that lens you
[00:49] gathered in failing and
[00:52] succeeding great question yeah so in
[00:56] general so I think if you share a bit
[00:58] about my background like in in in the
[01:00] past 10 10 years I've been uh really
[01:02] active in kind of what yeah I just
[01:05] always call it like new product
[01:06] development but I've seen that from and
[01:09] then especially like in Tech like
[01:10] digital products and businesses like
[01:12] I've seen that from um lots of different
[01:17] in lots of different roles basically so
[01:20] uh like I started my career at a tech
[01:22] investor uh I worked at the next web
[01:25] which is a big media publication in in
[01:28] Tech um I worked for product hunt I had
[01:31] my own growth marketing agency I've
[01:34] worked in traditional Finance at two big
[01:36] Banks that's like Innovation coach where
[01:38] like guided the teams that were
[01:39] developing like new business uh products
[01:42] and so I've seen like new ideas from
[01:46] these
[01:47] roles um and also yeah in different
[01:50] stages and from different different
[01:52] different angles and um yeah along the
[01:54] way I also built out my own ideas I also
[01:57] have an online course called No Cod MVP
[01:59] be where I teach people how they can
[02:01] validate their business ideas without
[02:03] knowing or learning how to code which I
[02:05] think you know a lot of people think
[02:07] that they should actually be able to do
[02:09] that but you should only build something
[02:11] if you know that you actually should
[02:13] right and so what I explained to people
[02:16] is that you know I and and also what I
[02:18] believe is that ideas are abundant right
[02:20] like there's a million trillion infinite
[02:23] ideas in in in the universe basically
[02:25] and when you have an idea of of your own
[02:30] I kind of see it as like you you pick
[02:32] that right like it it comes to you at
[02:34] some moment and at that moment you kind
[02:35] of combine things you know or things
[02:38] that should exist or things you see
[02:40] other people did Etc like you combine
[02:42] that
[02:43] into a mix that is then eventually
[02:46] represented as as your idea but when you
[02:50] ask someone you know hey tell me about
[02:52] your business idea right they always
[02:54] pitch something that is not yet existing
[02:57] and also already in the future right so
[02:59] I'm going to build an app for these
[03:02] people and they can do XYZ and it's
[03:05] going to they're going to pay this
[03:06] amount of Euros per month and I'm going
[03:08] to reach them in this marketing channel
[03:10] and grow like this or that or blah blah
[03:12] like whenever someone pitches it's
[03:14] basically a combination of all these
[03:16] assumptions about all these parts
[03:19] basically right there's a problem
[03:20] there's people with a problem uh or
[03:22] these people have that problem this is
[03:24] how I'm going to solve it it looks like
[03:26] this I'm going to ask this amount of
[03:27] money Etc but when you
[03:30] start uh and you are not in the future
[03:32] with the thing that is finished you
[03:35] first have to do activities to figure
[03:37] out if these assumptions are true right
[03:39] because an assumption is basically a
[03:41] statement that you define as true but if
[03:44] for example there's no one with the
[03:46] problem you think people have then why
[03:48] would you even build you know a
[03:50] technically
[03:52] difficult uh product basically and
[03:56] that's also by the way the Trap that a
[03:58] lot of people fall into as especially
[04:00] technical people actually have a blog
[04:01] post uh on on the internet somewhere
[04:03] that's called knowing how to code is a
[04:05] trap because people who can code can
[04:07] also build the thing so when they have
[04:09] the idea in their head they they just go
[04:11] on to building the thing but then when
[04:13] they launch they have a solution and
[04:15] they are basically looking uh for people
[04:17] with a problem which in the past 10
[04:19] years I've rarely seen work almost never
[04:23] um and that is just really hard so it's
[04:25] very important that in the beginning
[04:27] because you know each a is a combination
[04:30] of all these assumptions plus if there
[04:32] are an infinite amount of ideas it's
[04:35] basically a numbers game to find an idea
[04:37] that works for you right so if you
[04:40] accept that it's a numbers game and also
[04:42] accept that it's a combination of
[04:44] assumptions you have to challenge
[04:46] yourself at the point when when you have
[04:48] this idea okay when would I find this
[04:50] interesting enough or how much proof do
[04:52] I need to actually continue with this
[04:55] idea and invest more time money and
[04:58] energy into it to you know progress with
[05:01] with the idea um so how do you identify
[05:05] a good idea it's actually understanding
[05:08] that when you have your idea it's about
[05:10] a future big
[05:11] thing figure out how you can reverse
[05:14] engineer that to today like what do I
[05:16] actually know today what don't I know
[05:18] what is important what's not important
[05:19] and the things that you don't know
[05:21] enough about but are really important
[05:24] for example an example I I use a lot is
[05:28] um one of the biggest assumptions in the
[05:30] beginning of the Uber app was that they
[05:32] could use um like the Google Maps SDK
[05:35] basically so that they could uh
[05:37] Implement Google Maps into their app
[05:40] which was not widely used at that moment
[05:42] to actually you know show all the cars
[05:45] trans trans um or like send the location
[05:48] of the passenger Etc and that was one of
[05:51] their biggest assumption assumptions and
[05:52] if that would not have been um uh
[05:56] workable like if they wouldn't have been
[05:59] able to to do that then like the whole
[06:01] concept of being on a location as a
[06:03] passenger being on a location as a
[06:05] driver seeing each other getting matched
[06:07] in the most optimal way uh would have
[06:10] would have never worked basically so
[06:12] it's really important to when you think
[06:14] about your future idea to go back to
[06:15] today and I always kind of say like
[06:18] identify three to five assumptions that
[06:20] you really have to find more proof for
[06:24] in order for you to be comfortable
[06:26] enough to to continue right and it's a
[06:30] very personal exercise actually because
[06:32] if you and I would have the same idea
[06:34] and the same assumptions and the same
[06:36] information and we would do the same
[06:37] things to together more proof then even
[06:41] with the result we would still look at
[06:43] it differently right based on our risk
[06:45] appetite or a budget or you know what
[06:48] you know whatever makes me me and and
[06:50] you you basically so it's always really
[06:53] a
[06:54] personal decision and reflection on yeah
[06:57] also your own values and beliefs if you
[06:59] should continue uh with an idea so what
[07:03] makes a good idea I don't know if
[07:05] there's a universal answer but if you
[07:07] talk in business terms right if there's
[07:10] no one with a problem then it's going to
[07:12] be really hard to actually you know
[07:15] build a business or a product that
[07:17] serves a certain group uh of people
[07:19] especially nowadays like building a
[07:21] building a digital product is becoming
[07:23] easier every day but actually finding
[07:26] people are Distributing it in in the
[07:28] right way that that is very hard right
[07:30] because a lot of people are doing things
[07:32] and there's a lot of noise on the
[07:33] internet um so you can only succeed at
[07:37] that if you really know who you're
[07:39] targeting whose problem you're solving
[07:41] and if your solution also actually
[07:44] solves um the problem so my main advice
[07:47] always is go back to you know those
[07:50] three to five assumptions set a time
[07:52] frame let's say the next eight weeks or
[07:54] the next 12 weeks I'm going to
[07:56] investigate these assumptions and if
[08:00] you know I get these results then I'm
[08:02] going to continue so so create like
[08:04] measurable uh results that uh that you
[08:07] can draw your your conclusions from so
[08:10] basically when you when when we take an
[08:12] example for example like let's say I
[08:15] want to have the podcast and it should
[08:16] be like a really big one and uh I
[08:20] started out that just try to okay am I
[08:23] good in interviewing am I good in this
[08:25] like I like the assumption is oh I have
[08:28] to be good in interviewing the next
[08:29] assumption is or uh do I have enough
[08:33] listeners audience uh and the next
[08:35] assumption is can I monetize on on that
[08:37] and uh basically if I do a lot of
[08:39] interviews and uh like maybe like five
[08:42] 10 episodes then I see okay I have this
[08:45] and that uh I gather some information or
[08:49] maybe even monetization like when
[08:51] YouTube starts monetizing or X that's
[08:53] monetizing I I have one more proof point
[08:56] that maybe like a big company or sponsor
[08:59] pays me also money like you just try to
[09:02] GA information from what's is it in 20
[09:05] years and how does this reflect in the
[09:08] in the present if I get it
[09:10] right yeah but it's also really
[09:12] contextual based on the idea right so
[09:14] for a podcast like I I also started a
[09:17] podcast right like uh I don't know two
[09:19] two three months ago like a Bitcoin
[09:21] podcast for me like I I I don't have a
[09:24] lot of expectations my assumption is I
[09:27] know what I'm talking about I like
[09:29] talking to people uh I can use this
[09:33] editing
[09:34] software and one promise I made to
[09:37] myself is is I'm going to keep keep
[09:39] going like the main thing I think on
[09:41] YouTube and with podcasts that I read
[09:43] actually is you know consistency is key
[09:47] right so you just have to keep doing it
[09:50] um but I think in the context of a
[09:52] podcast
[09:53] yeah it's kind of like I I think I can
[09:56] make something interesting and you think
[09:57] you can make something interesting but
[09:59] it's eventually the people that decide
[10:00] if it's interesting right and it's the
[10:03] same with you know you can identify uh
[10:08] if we talk about a business application
[10:10] for example we can talk we can identify
[10:11] a certain problem people have but if
[10:13] it's not big enough right if if they
[10:15] don't wake up in the morning and think
[10:17] like you know damn how am I going to fix
[10:20] this then you can have your solution but
[10:22] then still you are
[10:24] more um uh how do you say that like uh
[10:28] uh paying Killer versus figh him and
[10:30] like it's not if if it's not uh
[10:34] increasing someone's uh you know value
[10:36] in life then it's just not good enough
[10:40] and so I think you know for a podcast in
[10:42] the context from you know we we probably
[10:44] have different goals but for me it's
[10:46] just like I'm going to continue doing
[10:48] this and if it's good enough I will get
[10:51] the signal that it's good enough from
[10:53] from the people that listen and I always
[10:56] think like if you solve a a problem or
[10:58] if you actually deliver value then of
[11:00] course you can make a business out of it
[11:02] right and by the way like if you uh
[11:06] making a business is asking for money
[11:09] well if you ask for money you also
[11:11] should know what the value is that you
[11:13] bring right and in a sale I first talk
[11:16] about the sell the value that I bring
[11:18] before I ask for the money so if I
[11:21] deliver value if I know that people are
[11:23] happy in this context you know with my
[11:25] podcast or you know that people are
[11:26] happy with your podcast that means it's
[11:29] valuable which means it represents money
[11:32] in some way right but in the context of
[11:34] a podcast it could take a bit longer I
[11:37] think in general because you have to
[11:39] establish you know your audience um
[11:42] first and also you know I think we are
[11:44] the same learning how to talk to other
[11:46] people and edit and all these all these
[11:48] things um you know it's it's
[11:51] um my goal for the podcast is just to
[11:54] learn and to connect with people and
[11:57] just broaden my Bitcoin Network I think
[12:00] this is also the the best goal you to
[12:02] have for a podcast it's like for me it
[12:05] just came out spontaneous because I grew
[12:07] on Ax and I had more and more zoom calls
[12:10] with with bitcoiners and then there was
[12:12] like the idea that I want to have a
[12:14] video format because I saw that a lot of
[12:17] people know Robin sire but almost nobody
[12:20] knew my face and so I was like I should
[12:23] have a video format if I actually want
[12:24] to to have my face associated with
[12:27] Bitcoin and then also start started uh I
[12:31] wanted to have um more Bitcoin
[12:34] conversations so it was like just a just
[12:37] a good um mix of that and if you listen
[12:40] if we
[12:41] now look in Bitcoin with that lens of
[12:46] what's a good idea what's the future
[12:48] assumptions like why is Bitcoin now such
[12:51] an amazing idea that so many people are
[12:53] there making content for it um
[12:56] allocating Capital to it yeah I think I
[12:58] think it's because Bitcoin solves an
[13:01] actual problem right it solves the
[13:05] problem that what used to be money or
[13:08] what money should be basically
[13:11] exchanging information between two
[13:13] people or two parties about the value
[13:16] that they exchange right basically what
[13:18] I just said I give you value in I fix
[13:21] your roof and you give me value in
[13:25] return in whatever we deem is valuable
[13:30] right so if when we talk about money the
[13:33] the people should decide what the money
[13:34] is right like in prison they decide that
[13:36] cigarettes are money uh because they are
[13:39] scarce and people find them valuable
[13:42] even when they don't smoke right so
[13:44] that's that's interesting um and so I
[13:47] think you know today on January 3D we
[13:50] celebrate this first Genesis block right
[13:54] and the quote that is in there talks
[13:56] about the bailouts for the banks and
[13:59] that is actually the problem that we
[14:02] have the problem that we have is that
[14:03] the banks and the government manipulate
[14:05] the money the technology that we use to
[14:07] exchange
[14:08] value and the citizens are always you
[14:12] know the last to actually benefit but
[14:15] also the first to to pay to pay for it
[14:19] and that's a big problem although a lot
[14:21] of people are not aware of the fact that
[14:23] that is a
[14:24] problem there are now a lot of people
[14:26] that do see that Bitcoin solves problem
[14:29] because it's provably scarce it's
[14:31] ultimately transparent which totally
[14:35] changes the incentives
[14:38] for the not only the value of the money
[14:42] but also kind of like the sustainability
[14:44] of that money like you can trust that in
[14:46] the
[14:47] future this type of money will be the
[14:50] same the same type that I have right now
[14:52] will be the same type of money that I
[14:54] will have in the future and when you
[14:56] compare that to the current situation
[14:58] that is is obviously not the case so I
[15:01] think Bitcoin solves a real problem what
[15:05] is very interesting I heard I was
[15:07] listening to a Dutch podcast and they
[15:10] were talking about the history of of
[15:12] Bitcoin right and and and that Satoshi
[15:15] actually combined a lot of things
[15:17] together right and and obviously also
[15:20] you know added added his
[15:22] own his his own
[15:24] Parts but then they were talking about
[15:26] is it the discovery or an invention and
[15:29] someone said it's a discovery from the
[15:31] future and I thought it was actually
[15:33] really cool
[15:35] that um and also saw a quote of hellin
[15:37] today that he says like in order for
[15:39] Bitcoin to be valuable or to work in the
[15:41] future like it has to have more value
[15:44] right it has to be worth more and so
[15:48] what I find interesting there is that
[15:50] hin was very very closely uh you know um
[15:54] connected with Satoshi and they
[15:55] exchanged the transactions right they
[15:57] were able to look at the current
[15:59] situation apply years
[16:02] of uh uh research and their own insights
[16:05] and their own um um yeah their own
[16:09] insights to something new but also look
[16:11] into the future and think about how how
[16:14] would this
[16:15] grow beyond our life
[16:18] basically and how can we apply that now
[16:21] and they they basically solve that which
[16:24] is crazy is crazy actually right if you
[16:27] look at any Tech
[16:29] technological um uh any new technology
[16:32] that follows like this adoption this
[16:34] scurve right nobody uh none of the
[16:39] people involved with those Technologies
[16:41] looked forward to how a certain adoption
[16:45] had to go in order for that technology
[16:47] to to stay relevant right and and be
[16:50] sustainable towards towards having an
[16:52] actual future and and they did that and
[16:55] that I think uh is is is a astounding
[16:59] actually that you you take that into
[17:01] into account and also kind of prepare
[17:04] for that and weave that into for example
[17:08] the issue uh the issue and schedule
[17:11] basically right like they they they took
[17:13] that so over such a long time that they
[17:17] also gave the people that amount of time
[17:20] to actually figure out how this would
[17:23] make their lives better yeah I think
[17:26] it's also really interesting when you
[17:28] think about startups and entrepreneurs
[17:30] and companies uh the founder is usually
[17:33] very long there and and driv the the
[17:36] company and like there's like companies
[17:39] where the found is still the CEO in like
[17:41] 25 30 years and Sosi Nakamoto left
[17:46] really early like he he moved on to
[17:49] another project or whatever happened
[17:53] with him really early on this is
[17:56] something maybe you can share some
[17:58] insight but from what I see with
[18:00] entrepreneurs and with startups it's
[18:02] really unusual for an entrepreneur to
[18:04] leave so early and the project to live
[18:06] on and be so much bigger than he left it
[18:10] with yeah that's actually an interesting
[18:13] thought to explore right because I I
[18:15] believe that for startups and new
[18:17] businesses actually the founders have to
[18:19] do all the work in the beginning all the
[18:22] acquisition distribution Marketing sales
[18:25] they have to do that in the beginning in
[18:27] order to figure out what works for their
[18:30] product or business and what not before
[18:32] they brief or hire someone that will
[18:37] then eventually do that for them so that
[18:38] it becomes a scalable uh uh business but
[18:42] yeah when you compare that to Satoshi
[18:44] who left very very early on I think it's
[18:46] actually the quote right he says I've
[18:47] moved on to other things or something or
[18:49] other projects He says I I yeah it's
[18:52] fascinating actually when I take those
[18:55] two two well one thing that happened
[18:57] that's she left but also my belief that
[18:59] a Founder has to help in that
[19:01] distribution it's actually pretty
[19:03] incredible that a
[19:06] technological Discovery or invention I
[19:09] use I say Discovery actually has real
[19:13] Grassroots adoption
[19:16] by the the people who accidentally and
[19:20] sometimes on purpose found it and also
[19:24] adopted it started using it playing with
[19:26] it Etc there's not a lot of things in
[19:29] history where that actually happened you
[19:31] know like a lot of things were pretty
[19:33] centralized in uh in their development
[19:36] and roll out and Etc where this is
[19:41] completely just yeah literally like
[19:44] spaghetti on the wall or see what you
[19:46] know see what sticks
[19:48] um now that I think about it it's
[19:51] actually it's a weird contrast because
[19:54] what I just said about like how crazy it
[19:56] is how they implemented all these
[19:59] thoughts
[20:00] about its survivability towards the
[20:03] future and then just letting it go yeah
[20:07] is a big contrast actually I never
[20:10] thought never thought about that uh
[20:11] before it should not work in that way
[20:15] definitely and maybe the fact that it
[20:17] works is is also like a sign that you
[20:20] know this is an actual thing and I think
[20:23] for me like I've I've been in Bitcoin
[20:25] for for I first found it like in 2014 so
[20:29] so 10 years on and off obviously like
[20:33] every like everyone
[20:35] um but there are a lot of these types of
[20:39] moments actually that I now realize that
[20:41] there are certain signals along the way
[20:45] that you just cannot
[20:48] um you cannot fade right like it's it's
[20:52] it's there are certain realizations
[20:54] along the way when you when you
[20:55] understand Bitcoin where you're like
[20:57] okay if if this is really like if this
[21:00] is really the thing you know after um
[21:03] just studying and thinking about it
[21:05] thinking about your own rationale like
[21:07] am I too bullish or too much in a dream
[21:09] world or whatever like like you know
[21:11] like really challenging yourself in the
[21:12] belief and your understanding about
[21:13] Bitcoin sometimes you end up at a point
[21:15] where you think like yeah really like
[21:17] could it really be this and then it is
[21:21] right and and and I think the conviction
[21:24] of a lot of people and the interest in
[21:26] Bitcoin also comes from kind of like the
[21:29] accumulation of of
[21:32] these seemingly Standalone points but
[21:35] then when you put them together you're
[21:36] like okay this is really this is more
[21:38] than money right this is a real soci
[21:40] like a technology for societal change
[21:42] and fix the money fix the world and all
[21:44] all these things like you you gradually
[21:46] go there but I think it's because you
[21:48] you gather like these little
[21:50] realizations I'd say along the way that
[21:53] U yeah that is just a really special
[21:55] thing and and maybe the de
[21:58] centralization and the the Grassroots
[22:00] movement that you describe because sat
[22:02] Nakamoto left so early and it he he he
[22:06] let it be and like he was like I created
[22:10] it and it can live on its own if it does
[22:14] because if the idea is strong enough it
[22:16] will obviously when you come from a
[22:18] startup and entrepreneur world you you
[22:20] know that you have to put in a work
[22:21] things don't work magically like you
[22:25] even if the product is amazing you still
[22:26] have to sell it you still have to Market
[22:28] it like nothing sells on its own but
[22:30] Bitcoin is kind of the the counterpart
[22:33] to it where it's actually kind of sells
[22:35] on its own because it's such a great
[22:37] idea and it's such an amazing invention
[22:39] where like sales people just jump on it
[22:42] and want to sell it like about it it's
[22:45] it's an amazing thing um when but but
[22:47] for the
[22:48] philosophy of what Bitcoin could be he
[22:51] had to go right and that is
[22:55] also I hope I I I don't know who it was
[22:58] like I always think it was hell finny
[23:00] but it's kind of weird if he would like
[23:02] email himself but maybe for like some
[23:05] obsc reasons it it could be a good idea
[23:08] but I I I don't like I hope this well
[23:11] it's weird like on one side I hope this
[23:13] person is alive to actually see what
[23:16] this became or the people or the group
[23:19] you know some people say it's four it
[23:21] was four people but it's also good that
[23:23] we don't have a person to look at right
[23:26] a person to worship or look look up to
[23:29] like people look at suckerberg or or all
[23:31] these like Silicon Valley type people
[23:34] because eventually this is not about the
[23:37] person that that created it like the the
[23:40] the the anonymity of of satosi Nakamoto
[23:46] is what bit what actually makes Bitcoin
[23:50] uh or gives Bitcoin like a legitimate
[23:52] chance
[23:54] to become what we think it it can become
[23:57] right if if there was a person then it
[23:59] would it it it it would already be
[24:01] different the whole point of Bitcoin is
[24:04] to prove or actually help us the humans
[24:09] with our own corruptibility you know by
[24:12] giving us a ledger a technology where we
[24:14] can exchange value with each other to
[24:16] protect us from that corruptibility from
[24:19] of ourselves and and and of the people
[24:21] that we would exchange value with so
[24:23] it's very good that there's not another
[24:25] human attached to it because it would be
[24:27] very easy to attack that person and say
[24:30] uh you you do it to become rich or I
[24:32] like all these stupid arguments so it's
[24:34] good that he's gone but I I I do hope
[24:38] that if if this person is alive that he
[24:40] could he or she could see it yeah that's
[24:43] that's that's true although I I think
[24:46] the the chances of him or her or the
[24:49] group being alive is really small but um
[24:53] like it's it's a crazy origin story
[24:55] which we makes bitco really original um
[24:59] when did you like you discovered first
[25:02] 2014 how did you discover
[25:05] it uh yeah so yeah 2013 uh yeah
[25:09] basically a vimeo
[25:11] video I I I maybe a friend I I send it I
[25:15] don't really know it was a vimeo video
[25:17] and was called Bitcoin explained it's
[25:18] still up but it's locked so you cannot
[25:21] see it which kind of sucks um that was
[25:24] basically the first time it's really
[25:26] good like animated EXP exper video of
[25:29] how Bitcoin works and my first interest
[25:32] was kind of like what you hear uh like
[25:35] Jack dorsy say a lot like the internet
[25:37] should have a
[25:38] currency like how the internet
[25:41] democratized um
[25:43] information um and connected us you know
[25:47] there should be a way to exchange value
[25:49] also directly so how we are connecting
[25:51] now directly we should be able to do
[25:54] that with with the currency and so
[25:55] that's kind of what triggered me at
[25:58] first yeah that that's just basically
[26:00] how I discovered it started reading
[26:01] about it I bought it I started sending
[26:04] with friends it was just really fun that
[26:06] we had no clue like what this um you
[26:09] know block scanner or blockchain page
[26:11] looked like with the fees and so like
[26:13] what the hell does this mean um yeah I
[26:17] was just basically playing playing
[26:19] around with it and I think slowly over
[26:22] time it's just yeah you start reading
[26:24] more listening to other people reading
[26:26] books and um um I always say like I
[26:29] bought at like three $400 it's not to
[26:32] flex because I also sold at 4K but you
[26:35] know um and and I felt really great
[26:38] about it actually I now have less
[26:40] Bitcoin than I had before so that's
[26:41] always I I think you should always say
[26:43] that like just do not sell you will
[26:45] never you will never you know get it
[26:48] back um and I got out for a while and
[26:51] then I actually uh I found ethereum at
[26:53] like $9 or something which also really
[26:56] interested me
[26:58] um you know this could be decentralized
[27:01] Computer Applications blah blah so I
[27:03] dove into that I played the whole uh
[27:06] Ico Casino I played all the nft stuff uh
[27:12] but slowly yeah
[27:14] uh saw I saw and it's also because of my
[27:18] background like if we think about you
[27:20] know um the ideas is a number numbers
[27:23] game right investing in startups is is a
[27:25] numbers game most ideas suck and that's
[27:27] fine right like that's just the way it
[27:30] goes but you have to figure out as
[27:31] quickly as possible if your idea
[27:32] actually sucks so you can move on to
[27:35] another another idea and see if that
[27:36] sucks and if not then of course you
[27:38] continue with it right um so I saw like
[27:41] all these coins I saw like all these
[27:43] icos everyone had a white paper blah
[27:45] blah nfts was the exact same thing as
[27:48] icos but now instead of a white paper
[27:51] people had a road map so it was even
[27:53] like a a lower threshold to to create a
[27:57] thing that other people could spend
[27:58] money on and I mean like I'm all for new
[28:02] technologies and playing around you know
[28:04] mess messing around uh when I was 11 I
[28:07] had a computer I burned CDs I sold them
[28:09] in school uh you know stuff like like
[28:12] that like people do that of course and
[28:14] and in a new technology wave everything
[28:16] in the beginning is just total Wild West
[28:18] so I always kind of played around in it
[28:22] with viewing it also like that right we
[28:24] are we are trying to figure out what
[28:26] works
[28:28] but the longer I was doing that the more
[28:30] Bitcoin came up as like
[28:33] this undercurrent of something that just
[28:37] kept doing the same thing basically I
[28:41] wasn't um sensitive to all these you
[28:46] know very ephemeral ideas that just came
[28:49] and went and boom and bust and all the
[28:51] all these things and so I think
[28:55] around um like I'd say three four years
[29:00] ago uh when I was in after these icos
[29:03] nfts I just started thinking okay I can
[29:06] dabble around in this wild west and and
[29:08] all this e stuff but the whole goal is
[29:11] to to get more more
[29:14] Bitcoin uh and I just started reading
[29:16] more books again on bitcoin and watching
[29:18] stuff and that is slowly moved
[29:21] everything uh from all the all the e
[29:24] stuff to to bitcoin so now I'm uh
[29:27] now I'm 80% net worth in
[29:30] Bitcoin the rest is Cash yeah so that's
[29:33] it but but actually and I I've shared
[29:35] this previously as well on other podcast
[29:37] like what what actually really got me is
[29:40] I was into Bitcoin I was following it
[29:43] you know also big percentage uh already
[29:46] in Bitcoin I worked at a bank I was 30
[29:49] and I worked at a bank and I had a
[29:51] mortgage and uh I was talking uh with a
[29:55] colleague and he and he said to me did
[29:56] you know that the money money in the
[29:57] bank is not yours and I said what like
[30:00] what what are you talking about and he's
[30:02] like yeah yeah so we had lunch for an
[30:04] hour and he explained to me like how
[30:06] fractional Reserve banking worked and
[30:08] all these things and then after that
[30:09] launch I was like damn I'm I'm an idiot
[30:12] like I'm participating I'm working at a
[30:14] bank I'm working at a goddamn bank and
[30:16] I'm participating in a system I have a
[30:18] mortgage and I have a bank account and
[30:20] I'm I'm participating in a system that I
[30:21] truly do not understand how Wild is that
[30:24] and I'm also into Bitcoin like I am I I
[30:26] have to to I don't know fix my life
[30:29] that's what I thought like I I'm doing
[30:32] something and and I have to I have to
[30:34] fix this like I have to understand this
[30:36] and and actually also have an opinion
[30:39] about it that's really how I felt like I
[30:42] I don't like
[30:43] to um do something that I don't
[30:47] understand like it's kind of like uh
[30:48] I've tweeted about this once like uh not
[30:51] like control freak but I like to
[30:53] understand right like if if a guy comes
[30:54] here and fixes stuff in my kitchen I
[30:56] like to watch because I not to control
[30:58] him but to understand what he's doing
[31:00] because I find it interesting in in a
[31:03] sense but then I also think like if I'm
[31:05] participating in in a system or um and I
[31:09] don't understand it then that sounds
[31:11] dangerous actually right like that you
[31:14] give that control away to a third party
[31:17] or third parties that totally don't care
[31:20] about uh Brum gin right like that's just
[31:24] yeah and then so so then I dove into
[31:27] more like the finance and economics
[31:30] dimensions of Bitcoin to actually
[31:32] understand that more so that's kind of
[31:34] when I moved from you know technical
[31:37] internet uh kind of point of view on
[31:40] bitcoin to more this this economics and
[31:42] finance and uh when I really went all in
[31:45] on bitcoin was when I just realized okay
[31:48] I'm saving my wealth in a system that is
[31:50] provably you know not working and
[31:52] stealing from me and I can move it to a
[31:55] system that is working for me where I'm
[31:57] way more Sovereign so I don't even see
[31:59] it as buying Bitcoin anymore I just see
[32:01] it as I have value in system a that
[32:04] sucks and I'm just moving the value to
[32:06] system B that works system B pun
[32:08] intended yeah
[32:12] okay that's a crazy perspective because
[32:15] I I think the thought that should come
[32:17] up to in my head is like people uh when
[32:20] I speak with outside Bitcoin normies
[32:24] outside of the Bitcoin World they often
[32:25] say like yeah but I don't don't
[32:27] understand it I don't have the time to
[32:29] research it and stuff like that but then
[32:31] ask him like how's fat working like like
[32:35] I think fear is way
[32:37] more yeah they don't they don't know
[32:39] what they are participating in they
[32:41] think they they think they know and they
[32:44] think that the people who decide about
[32:49] it actually that it's legitimized that
[32:52] other people decide what the money you
[32:55] know I.E technology they use to exchange
[32:57] value with other people again what that
[32:59] should be worth they they they don't
[33:01] understand that they actually legitimize
[33:04] it by not understanding it in a sense
[33:07] right and and I don't blame them I mean
[33:10] that was me again with a mortgage and
[33:11] working at a bank totally
[33:14] asleep and it wasn't really like a
[33:18] problem or something that triggered me
[33:20] to dive into it it was more the
[33:21] realization or or that I luckily you
[33:24] know encountered had an encounter with
[33:26] someone who who explained that to me but
[33:30] yeah you cannot blame people that they
[33:32] they they they are asleep on this
[33:35] subject that's of course the whole
[33:37] deliberate thing from the people that
[33:38] are actually in control of the money to
[33:40] not tell you about how the money how the
[33:42] money works that's the whole point yeah
[33:45] it's a it's a crazy system um we touched
[33:47] on it before you you recently start a
[33:49] new podcast uh you talk about Bitcoin
[33:52] Bitcoin for Millen Millennials uh you
[33:54] have quite big Following also Al on on X
[33:57] you have a newsletter um what like what
[34:01] is the importance of having a like
[34:03] completely different topic now from
[34:05] Bitcoin but what is the important of
[34:06] having a personal brand in the
[34:08] entrepreneurial scene and the uh
[34:10] founding scene uh or like even broader
[34:14] maybe even the career thing like do do
[34:16] we all have to have a personal brand
[34:19] this social media like how does this
[34:21] change the whole
[34:23] landscape yeah good question I think I
[34:27] didn't really like maintain my online
[34:30] brand for well maybe for the last year I
[34:33] did but before
[34:35] that I think for two three years I
[34:37] didn't I had a son a few years ago was
[34:40] taking care of him I was just more a bit
[34:43] less like career focused so I kind of
[34:45] like didn't um yeah use already the
[34:50] following I had uh before yeah but I
[34:53] think it's really essential I think it
[34:55] shows that
[34:58] um you know it's good I think to show
[35:01] what you do and what interests you
[35:03] especially
[35:04] because you know nowadays like on the
[35:07] internet I think I assume you went to
[35:09] college or university you know like but
[35:12] but nowadays on the
[35:13] internet maybe it's except from like
[35:16] Astro being coming an astrophysicist or
[35:19] a doctor or something like most like 80%
[35:21] of
[35:22] subjects that uh you could study for
[35:27] right or or or get a job in like you can
[35:30] find information about that on the
[35:32] internet um but it's very important I
[35:35] think to show how you actually apply
[35:38] that right and and even us making a
[35:40] podcast is also some form of proof of
[35:43] work right you have to do work to to
[35:47] have a podcast um and so it's really
[35:51] good if you can if you can broadcast and
[35:54] show that right so not maybe in a
[35:56] classic way like like a portfolio that
[35:58] some people have but it's uh you know
[36:01] you're Robin and you're doing different
[36:03] things and you know different things and
[36:05] um yeah I think it's important to to
[36:08] establish yourself in a certain way that
[36:11] so that people know what they can um
[36:16] talk with you about basically um so yeah
[36:19] I think the short answer is to sh just
[36:21] uh yes and also well yeah now to think
[36:27] about it like for example the people who
[36:29] work in banking they don't really have
[36:31] like online online profiles where they
[36:33] showcase what they talk about at least
[36:35] not not uh not all of them but I think
[36:39] it actually
[36:40] shows also curiousness right like uh I'm
[36:43] just rambling a bit but I'm thinking
[36:45] about like these guys from Wall Street
[36:47] that we now follow around the ETF uh you
[36:50] know or or certain types of analysts uh
[36:54] um I found Fred Krueger do you know Fred
[36:56] Krueger I heard about him but I did not
[36:59] uh yeah I just recently discovered him
[37:00] but this is also a guy who's like 30
[37:02] years in Wall Street and like Trader and
[37:04] he now is just sharing his thoughts on
[37:06] Twitter I don't know for how long but I
[37:08] just recently discovered him but I think
[37:10] you know especially people from that
[37:12] World um they didn't need or want I'd
[37:17] say want probably um you know like an
[37:19] online brand Etc but now you see that
[37:23] they can actually connect with people
[37:25] outside of their old bubble because they
[37:27] really bring something
[37:29] new um to online communities you know
[37:33] like on on on X
[37:35] so yeah again I think the shorter answer
[37:37] is yes but especially um maybe
[37:40] especially for people who come from like
[37:42] specialist
[37:44] um um careers or or jobs you know like
[37:47] it's it's especially a great opportunity
[37:50] I think for them to to establish their
[37:52] their personal brand online yeah I agree
[37:55] like um having having a brand I think
[37:57] it's it's like just speaking about what
[38:00] you're passionate about is an amazing
[38:03] experience and having the feedback also
[38:05] like I also learn a lot about Bitcoin
[38:08] itself like I started posting on on X
[38:11] just just this year in general like with
[38:13] like 400 followers and and just learning
[38:16] about it and just dealing with it that
[38:18] you get a lot of good feedback also from
[38:20] the community that's I like it a lot
[38:23] yeah um we having an Android on the
[38:27] podcast where the previous guest asked a
[38:30] question for the for the next guest and
[38:32] it's it's about Bitcoin and fear culture
[38:36] what is the main difference for you and
[38:38] it's especially a good question actually
[38:40] for you because it's uh you can talk
[38:43] about your banking um past what is the
[38:46] main difference for you between Bitcoin
[38:48] culture and Fiat culture well one of the
[38:51] things I
[38:52] I I love and now also kind of see in my
[38:56] own life is you know this this short
[38:58] short-term time preference and long-term
[39:00] time preference that safe de talks about
[39:02] like if
[39:03] you if you move the wealth that you have
[39:06] from a
[39:07] system wherein you constantly have to
[39:11] take risk and mitigate you know the the
[39:15] the debasement of the currency that you
[39:17] use to to store your wealth then you are
[39:20] constantly busy doing that and if you're
[39:24] not interested in doing that you know or
[39:26] it's if it's not particularly your your
[39:29] skill then you have to Outsource it or
[39:31] have some sort of advisor or whatever
[39:32] like it occupies your brain and and the
[39:36] energy that you have but when you move
[39:38] that wealth to A system that once you
[39:42] understand it and see it you know that
[39:45] the wealth that is here now will be
[39:47] there in the future in the same way or
[39:51] more then that gives you a lot of new
[39:55] space in your head to actually think
[39:56] about you know what are the things that
[39:57] I find important or what do I want to
[39:59] spend time on and I think that can cover
[40:01] a broad range of subjects from uh I
[40:04] think I once said like also just like
[40:06] what do I want to spend money on or
[40:09] money that I have like I have I don't
[40:11] know I like sneakers and sometimes I see
[40:13] new sneakers and I think like oh I want
[40:14] to have them but then I think like no
[40:16] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] no and then I just for
[40:18] that amount I just buy Bitcoin
[40:21] now uh just because I know that the
[40:24] sneakers won't bring me
[40:27] the
[40:29] the what I think I want to get by buying
[40:34] the sneakers right like kind of this
[40:36] little dope mean hit or or whatever so
[40:39] if I think about oh I want to buy these
[40:40] sneakers then well apparently I have two
[40:43] or
[40:43] $300 or Euros left
[40:46] over I'd rather save that towards the
[40:49] future for my family for my child to
[40:52] sustain myself Etc right so I I I feel
[40:55] it shift sh your perspective from
[40:59] actually a pretty narrow view where you
[41:04] consume without
[41:06] understanding why you're actually doing
[41:09] that to actually a very broad
[41:12] perspective where you're very conscious
[41:15] about what you want to spend your time
[41:19] energy and and money on and um yeah I
[41:23] think I I I think that's great and also
[41:27] I think uh we talked about this in the
[41:29] space with alesandro um on Monday the
[41:33] the difference between we talked about
[41:36] uh I think it was stock trading and I
[41:38] realized that you know when people do
[41:41] stock trading or uh Forex or all this
[41:44] all this stuff like you're basically
[41:46] playing against other people you're
[41:48] trying to figure out like what would
[41:50] other people do with the information
[41:51] that I see now or there's this big there
[41:54] this famous quote about I think uh banki
[41:57] like this old I think he was the FED
[41:59] director um was like at this party and
[42:02] someone asked like are you sick and then
[42:04] he says I cannot say that if I'm sick or
[42:06] not because that would crash the market
[42:08] or something right like all these little
[42:10] nonsense things where where you're like
[42:14] playing with the interpretation of
[42:16] information of other people and then
[42:18] these people are playing with each other
[42:19] to trade and stuff like that well we saw
[42:21] it in Bitcoin today big long
[42:24] liquidations you know
[42:26] in Bitcoin you play against yourself you
[42:29] play against your first to understand
[42:33] Bitcoin you you play against yourself in
[42:35] terms of like challenging your ego
[42:38] understanding that you don't understand
[42:39] everything understand that things that
[42:42] you learned before aren't true
[42:45] understanding what is actually
[42:46] true actually integrating that
[42:50] and operate in a different way now that
[42:53] you understand that you know the world
[42:56] Works in a different way and then you
[42:58] keep playing this game against yourself
[43:01] when you when you hold Bitcoin so it's
[43:03] not it's not I see it more as like
[43:07] personal development instead of you
[43:09] winning and someone else losing and uh
[43:12] well I I hope that makes sense but
[43:13] that's for me is really the different
[43:15] right like it it feels like again narrow
[43:18] point of view very shortterm time Focus
[43:20] to way broader view way more conscious
[43:23] and way more long-term Focus so feels
[43:26] more like building versus consuming in a
[43:30] sense yeah I think you nailed it when
[43:32] you said like when when you on a Bitcoin
[43:35] or sound money standard uh you don't
[43:37] have to worry about uh Financial energy
[43:39] you don't have to be a Investment
[43:42] Portfolio manager on the side next to
[43:44] your I don't know lawyer or doctor or
[43:46] whatever job yeah
[43:47] exactly you you can focus on what you
[43:50] want what you are good at and uh also
[43:54] like a big thing as you said the time
[43:55] preference like when when the money is
[43:57] getting more worth over time like you
[44:00] you have a you get money and you have
[44:03] the decision buy that the sneakers today
[44:05] or maybe can I wait like half a year
[44:07] longer uh in half a year money will be
[44:10] more worth on the S money standard so
[44:13] the sneakers will be actually cheaper on
[44:16] a on a feeld standard on a fe culture
[44:18] you're like this if I don't spend it
[44:21] today the money will be worth less and
[44:24] the sneakers will be uh more expensive
[44:27] like people are incentivized to spend
[44:30] faster and and more so that's that that
[44:34] will it will be interesting to see how
[44:36] this changes on also people are
[44:38] incentivized
[44:39] to yes build versus consume right
[44:42] they're incentivized to create value
[44:45] because if what you can receive as value
[44:51] right in the value transaction is the
[44:53] hardest money to ever exist then you are
[44:57] basically forced to also deliver actual
[45:01] value right so you can you deserve to be
[45:04] compensated in that hardest money to
[45:07] ever exist today I was listening to
[45:09] Jimmy's song with Robert breed I think
[45:12] in an episode it was wild Jimmy song
[45:15] shared that the first uh Boeing seven
[45:18] the seven4 S the big
[45:20] one from plan to first delivery or
[45:24] production start of production
[45:26] I'm probably butchering it a bit but
[45:28] let's say from ideation to First
[45:30] production or first production delivery
[45:34] was 20
[45:35] months the second like bigger iteration
[45:38] on the
[45:39] 747 took like 10
[45:44] years wild and that is because if if you
[45:49] are incentivized to uh he I think he
[45:53] calls it a rent Seeker right profit from
[45:58] other people that are actually trying to
[46:00] deliver value in still a broken
[46:03] system and you don't have to do that but
[46:06] you can
[46:07] still live in some way yeah then why
[46:10] would you deliver value but if we only
[46:13] trade in the hardest money to ever exist
[46:16] then the competition will be [ __ ]
[46:17] Fierce and you have to do something you
[46:20] cannot be a rent Seeker anymore and yeah
[46:23] that's just uh I I find that very
[46:25] interesting thought because I do but
[46:27] like it sounds maybe a bit scary like
[46:29] you have to you have to deliver value
[46:31] you have to do stuff but you can also
[46:33] deliver value by cooking or cleaning or
[46:35] whatever like everyone has their own set
[46:38] of skills and interests and stuff like
[46:40] that so it's not about who is better
[46:42] than another person it's about actually
[46:44] doing what you love and not being forced
[46:46] to do something you don't like uh
[46:49] because in the short term that you need
[46:51] to earn uh you know broken money you you
[46:54] have to Broken you have to to do stuff
[46:56] you don't like but in a sound money
[46:59] system I think at least conceptually I
[47:02] follow this train of thought where I
[47:04] think then you are actually incentivized
[47:06] to do and figure out and then do what
[47:10] you're actually really good at because
[47:11] that will be the only way where you will
[47:15] get fair Fairly compensated for the fa
[47:18] value that you deliver and now it's not
[47:21] the case it's not the case in the lower
[47:23] class and it's especially not the case
[47:24] in the in upper class there's a lot of
[47:26] people that don't add value that earn
[47:28] 300K a year and that's uh that's the
[47:32] whole point of broken money or Fiat
[47:35] money versus sound money or Bitcoin is
[47:38] money yeah everybody has to deliver his
[47:40] proof of work the they are no longer uh
