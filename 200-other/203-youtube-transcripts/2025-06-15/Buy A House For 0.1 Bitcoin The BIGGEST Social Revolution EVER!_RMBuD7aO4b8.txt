[00:00] learning about Finance discovering that
[00:01] our system is [ __ ] then learning about
[00:03] crypto and then learning that crypto is
[00:05] the same as the rest of the system just
[00:07] a bit worse that's how I landed with
[00:09] Bitcoin Bitcoin is not a technological
[00:12] Revolution it's a social Revolution and
[00:14] a social technology so to speak cuz you
[00:16] can copy the entire code base of Bitcoin
[00:19] I mean it's literally free open source
[00:21] software it's in GitHub you can copy it
[00:23] you can deploy it by yourself but what
[00:25] you cannot copy is me and my belief in
[00:28] Bitcoin is you and your podcast your
[00:30] community in Bitcoin right all of that
[00:32] you cannot copy that like it's not that
[00:34] like cuz people say oh with Bitcoin how
[00:36] like Bitcoin is so volatile how are we
[00:38] going to be able to price anything on
[00:40] the on the market like on the grocery
[00:42] store or anywhere it's like guys it's
[00:44] not going to be like a life chart of the
[00:46] price of pears and apples and bananas
[00:49] like no cuz there's companies in between
[00:51] that they manage this volatility for the
[00:53] end consumer people are going to be
[00:54] making memes about us of like oh my God
[00:57] they bought Bitcoin at $100,000 even if
[00:59] it was just like 500 that they put in
[01:02] and now they're being able to sell it or
[01:04] exchange it for a Mercedes for example
[01:07] guys we are in the 70s and we are the
[01:13] Boomers I think I think that uh is
[01:16] something that we really can can start
[01:17] with the students uh because I see a big
[01:22] age Gap in in the Bitcoin ecosystem most
[01:26] of them are over 30 and the average is
[01:28] around like 47
[01:30] at least that's what I see my statistics
[01:33] and there are a lot of people even like
[01:34] above 50 above 60 because people feel
[01:38] like uh you have to educate the above 50
[01:41] 60 crowd on bitcoin no like you have to
[01:43] actually educate the under 25 crowd on
[01:47] on bitcoin so how did you come into
[01:50] Bitcoin with with being a
[01:52] student um well because I was studying
[01:55] economics and uh I was interested since
[01:58] very young so like I was and already
[02:00] thinking about like personal finance and
[02:03] and and and the pension system and the
[02:05] and the retirement because I knew that
[02:07] my generation was not going to get like
[02:10] uh like any pensions and I also knew
[02:12] that compounding interest was very
[02:14] powerful but compounding interest is the
[02:16] most powerful the longer it is applied
[02:20] so it's about time uh so when you're
[02:22] very young you can actually like
[02:23] Leverage it very hard uh but of course
[02:25] it requires patience um and through that
[02:29] knowledge of like hey I have a long time
[02:31] Horizon and I'm not going to get any
[02:33] pension any help from the government I
[02:34] need to as we say in Spanish S I have to
[02:38] take out my cashews out of the fire I
[02:40] think it's cashew I don't know what
[02:42] castanas is now but anyway you know I
[02:44] got I got to take my things I got to
[02:45] take care of them by myself right um so
[02:49] I started exploring like you know
[02:50] personal finance how to save what are
[02:53] the best ways to invest on another just
[02:54] with 16 177 um so quite quite early
[02:58] quite young but of course the problem
[03:00] when you're that young is you don't have
[03:01] any capital and your means to generate
[03:04] that Capital so like cash flows usually
[03:06] salaries are
[03:09] quite tight like you don't really have
[03:12] many ways of making revenue of getting
[03:15] paid uh especially if you are like a
[03:18] student um a full-time student yeah you
[03:21] could get a job but you also want to
[03:22] live your life and depending on your
[03:24] situation even if you get a job you may
[03:26] not be able to save too much so I was on
[03:29] that path of like okay I know I need to
[03:31] save I know I need I have very little
[03:34] Capital uh and possibilities to generate
[03:37] Capital so I need to go extremely risky
[03:42] back then it was risky now I know it's
[03:44] the most conservative thing in the world
[03:47] um so I went all the way out to crypto
[03:50] like whoa that's where you can get crazy
[03:52] returns right and because I have a long
[03:54] investment Horizon like 40 plus years at
[03:56] the very least um the risks don't really
[03:59] matter because the question is not where
[04:02] crypto is going to be in 5 years the
[04:05] question is where it's going to be in 40
[04:07] That's when I'm going to need to that
[04:08] money right for my for my uh pension um
[04:12] so so I went down that path I got burned
[04:16] quite badly like I actually fell for
[04:18] some uh for for one Ponzi scheme using
[04:21] crypto Arbitrage as like the smok
[04:24] mirrors to get get you confused but that
[04:29] that like like scam was the one that
[04:31] like got me that thousand master's
[04:33] degree in uh in blockchain technology
[04:36] which then with that expertise led me to
[04:39] Bitcoin mining I did an internship while
[04:41] being a a college student so that's so I
[04:44] did 16 to 19 I learned about Finance
[04:48] personal finance and whatnot then I
[04:49] started studying economics when I was 19
[04:52] uh in my hometown in
[04:54] Barcelona and on the first year the fir
[04:57] that first summer after covid I got into
[05:00] the Ponzi scheme and then by the next
[05:02] summer uh I was joining a Bitcoin mining
[05:05] company out of Germany uh that they were
[05:08] doing both high performance Computing
[05:10] artificial intelligence Bitcoin mining
[05:13] all of that stuff and it was there where
[05:16] I went from blockchain not Bitcoin to
[05:19] bitcoin only Bitcoin nothing matters but
[05:22] Bitcoin so that's that's through this
[05:25] path of like learning about Finance
[05:28] discovering that our system is [ __ ]
[05:29] then learning about crypto and then
[05:31] learning that crypto is the same as the
[05:33] rest of the system just a bit worse um
[05:36] that's how I landed with
[05:38] Bitcoin I love that you say crypto is
[05:41] the same as the rest of the system just
[05:42] a little bit worse like it's it's
[05:44] basically feat system but like even even
[05:46] worse than that because there are
[05:47] absolutely no democr uh there are no
[05:51] structures behind that that kind of have
[05:53] any checkpoints it's just like pure Wild
[05:55] West with centralized power uh the worst
[06:00] of the worst you you pick the worst of
[06:02] Bitcoin and the worst of fear then it's
[06:05] crypto let's see what happens if we mush
[06:07] them together what only scams
[06:11] weird and and it's a it's a it's a weird
[06:14] thing where uh I don't want to talk too
[06:17] much about crypto but uh there are so
[06:20] many crypto scams and people know they
[06:22] are crypto scams but they still want to
[06:25] get into the investment because they
[06:27] think they might be able to get sooner
[06:30] out than the other ones and get not rock
[06:32] pulled and so they they try to to to
[06:35] ride those small trains to make like a
[06:38] 50 ax or 100 ax or 10 10,000 ax in like
[06:41] a few weeks which obviously most of them
[06:46] had wrecked really badly uh but but uh
[06:50] it's like most are aware that crypto is
[06:52] a scam like it's it's it's common
[06:54] knowledge I have I I I I made a I mean
[06:57] maybe it's my bubble but I made a
[06:59] community post around that topic and
[07:01] asked like oh like are you invested in
[07:03] uh in anything else than Bitcoin uh
[07:07] meaning like crypto and altcoins uh and
[07:10] and why and people like really wrote
[07:12] down like like it's it's pure gamble I
[07:14] just like try to get more Bitcoin like
[07:16] all those answers and 50% were fully in
[07:19] Bitcoin but like still a big big
[07:21] majority was like dable without coins
[07:24] but only for speculation there's like no
[07:26] intrinsic value for me there's no belief
[07:28] system yeah yeah no that's and it's it's
[07:31] quite sad because there's two types of
[07:33] uh of people that invest in crypto the
[07:36] people that have been fooled by The
[07:38] Narrative of oh Bitcoin is too slow but
[07:41] crypto blockchain is the future yeah you
[07:43] need to get into crypto they're fooled
[07:44] by that and they're just regular people
[07:46] trying to make a bit of an investment
[07:48] they get in and they get scammed they
[07:50] lose most of their money so one out of a
[07:52] 100 one out of a thousand May perhaps
[07:54] make a bit of money and that just keeps
[07:56] the cycle going but then that's type
[07:59] number one and the other type is I would
[08:01] argue even worse because they as you
[08:03] said they know it's it's a scam they
[08:05] know it doesn't have any value they know
[08:07] that it doesn't teach you anything it
[08:09] doesn't improve anything like I wouldn't
[08:11] even say it's a zero sum game it's a
[08:12] negative sum game right and they get in
[08:16] with their extra knowledge than the
[08:17] other crowd and they try to game the
[08:20] system but gaming the system just means
[08:22] if I make a dollar you lost two you know
[08:25] it's and it's like yeah now you have
[08:26] more Bitcoin but at what cost like you
[08:29] just sold your morals to a certain
[08:31] degree like I don't know that doesn't
[08:34] sit well with me but anyway yeah so so
[08:36] that's that's how I got into Bitcoin and
[08:38] uh I'm glad that we agree on on the
[08:41] state of crypto in general I usually
[08:43] like to say that um Bitcoin was a step
[08:45] forward and then crypto was like turning
[08:48] around and sprinting
[08:50] backwards so yeah I I love that it's
[08:54] it's um uh and I love my crowd because
[08:57] like I had a few weeks ago go someone on
[09:00] that was in the past uh shielding
[09:03] ethereum and other things like that uh
[09:05] and he doesn't do that anymore uh so
[09:08] he's now Bitcoin only and and he still
[09:11] has the like we debated actually on the
[09:13] podcast this topic of like okay will
[09:15] there be a better Bitcoin and I said
[09:17] like no and he said like there might be
[09:19] at the moment I don't see anything but
[09:21] there might be uh and even that guest
[09:24] that is now Bitcoin only someone was
[09:26] like oh you're interviewing a shitcoin
[09:28] and and show me like a a post of him in
[09:31] 2022 and I'm like hey that's like three
[09:33] years ago like people can people can
[09:35] educate them together and they they
[09:37] deserve a second chance yeah you brought
[09:40] up two interesting topics the first one
[09:42] is the question of will there have will
[09:44] there be a better Bitcoin because
[09:46] recently uh two weeks ago we had a
[09:47] Meetup here because I run the meetups
[09:49] here in Barcelona and I I got asked that
[09:52] question um and I think I came up with a
[09:55] pretty nice answer for why there
[09:56] wouldn't be a new one but then the
[09:58] second topic is the whole thing of like
[10:00] Bitcoin maximalism and being a bitcoiner
[10:02] and it's the fact of it's it's it's like
[10:04] a lithos test of like super Purity and
[10:07] then oh there's always going to be
[10:08] someone more pure more hardcore than you
[10:11] and they will be and they will put the
[10:13] bar ever so higher than you so therefore
[10:16] at the end only one person is the true
[10:18] Bitcoin maximalist and that's the that's
[10:20] the [ __ ] craziest person right so
[10:22] that that's what happen oh three years
[10:24] ago you touched once ethereum oh you're
[10:26] a shitcoin all of that or or what you
[10:28] also think that Monero is has value
[10:31] because it has its dark money and not
[10:33] just heart money oh [ __ ] coiner [ __ ]
[10:35] corer right um so it's an interesting
[10:37] toping topic especially taking into
[10:39] account that as um adoption happens
[10:43] we're going to get more people coming in
[10:46] and more people necessarily means that
[10:49] we're going to have an eternal September
[10:51] as as it's called in the in the Bitcoin
[10:53] Circles of like uh we will never have
[10:56] again the level of Purity and the level
[10:59] of signal and the level of like depth
[11:02] and knowledge equally spread out across
[11:05] the community because not everyone has
[11:06] the time and as we adopt we're getting
[11:09] further away from the super hardcore uh
[11:12] bitcoiners and entering more the you
[11:15] know like hey my mom is now buying
[11:17] Bitcoin or my uncle is buying Bitcoin or
[11:19] my cousin is buying Bitcoin right and
[11:21] what do they know about Bitcoin right
[11:23] but there're still bitcoiners because
[11:24] they only buy Bitcoin right so that that
[11:26] whole thing of like hey only this makes
[11:28] you bit coin Ah that's that's that's
[11:30] going away but then the the first topic
[11:32] on um if there's going to be a better
[11:36] Bitcoin what I answered in the in the in
[11:38] the Meetup is that it's never going to
[11:41] happen because Bitcoin is not a
[11:43] technological Revolution it's a social
[11:46] Revolution and a social technology so to
[11:48] speak because you can copy the entire
[11:50] code base of Bitcoin I mean it's
[11:53] literally free open source software it's
[11:55] in GitHub you can find it everywhere you
[11:57] can copy it you can deploy it by
[11:59] yourself but what you cannot copy is me
[12:02] and my belief in Bitcoin is you and your
[12:04] podcast and your community in Bitcoin
[12:06] right all of that you cannot copy that
[12:09] like it's you can't there's no way of
[12:11] doing like control C control V you can
[12:14] do that with a code but not with the
[12:15] network and what matters is the network
[12:17] because Bitcoin may be layer one but the
[12:20] humans are layer zero nodes are not run
[12:22] by themselves there's people behind them
[12:24] that run them and that have them at home
[12:26] and then maintain them and decide which
[12:29] upgrade goes in and which upgrade goes
[12:31] out and and what they put on them right
[12:33] so that's layer zero and you cannot copy
[12:36] humans so that's and that's the
[12:38] revolution because money is a social
[12:40] technology right so so that's what I
[12:43] answered and I thought like that's a
[12:45] good way to like dispel all of that oh
[12:47] but what if this new shitcoin with uh
[12:50] this and that with this technology and
[12:52] that technology great perfect but unless
[12:54] they have a better launch than what
[12:57] Bitcoin had more fair
[13:00] transparent uh like open for everyone
[13:03] with no actual founding member like he
[13:06] shouldn't be around for more than it's
[13:08] necessary like unless they're able to do
[13:10] that plus also copy the network effects
[13:13] they're not going to be able to and
[13:14] everyone says oh what if Facebook
[13:16] destroyed Myspace yeah that's a
[13:18] different thing like that's not money
[13:21] that's just like social networks people
[13:22] were using Myspace people were using
[13:24] Microsoft uh message MSN right the with
[13:27] the buzzers and whatnot people were
[13:28] using all kinds of social platforms but
[13:30] people only use one money usually
[13:33] mostly and also there's the aspect of
[13:36] like you compare a product to a protocol
[13:39] like Bitcoin is a protocol and Facebook
[13:41] is a product exactly products have
[13:44] always have like um like for example if
[13:48] you use a wallet uh this might be
[13:51] replaced because there might come a
[13:52] better a wallet on on bitcoin there
[13:54] might come a better hard wallet there
[13:56] might come uh better mining device like
[14:00] there might come better products around
[14:03] Bitcoin the protocol but the protocol
[14:06] Bitcoin uh will will stick around just
[14:09] the the way we use the tcpip protocol
[14:12] there so many different protocols that
[14:14] we they still use and then we we just
[14:17] have the different layers on top of each
[14:19] other and the the more we move up the
[14:22] layers the higher the competition gets
[14:24] like we already have like Bitcoin and
[14:26] then then there's like liquid and
[14:27] lightning and always there's more
[14:29] competition going on on Layer Two than
[14:31] on layer one because it's just Bitcoin
[14:33] and then on layer three and layer four
[14:34] which might be an ETF might be Bitcoin
[14:37] on Exchange might be uh like a fedin
[14:40] might be like whatever it is layer three
[14:41] or four like however you want to Define
[14:43] that there's
[14:45] competition uh but not on the base
[14:47] product uh protocol level so I I do
[14:51] enjoy that a lot and also one thing is
[14:54] um the protocol is moldable so it's not
[14:58] uh a protocol that is like static and we
[15:02] cannot change it if there's actually
[15:03] something interesting going on in
[15:04] altcoins or anything else we could adopt
[15:07] it in Bitcoin if and if it's essential
[15:09] we will adopt it because people will
[15:11] like to continue use Bitcoin and not
[15:14] lose all the life savings exactly yeah
[15:16] and it's funny that you say that because
[15:18] it was two of us on stage answering that
[15:21] question and I gave my part but you
[15:23] actually gave like you gave the same
[15:25] answer as my friend so like
[15:29] like I don't know it's great like the
[15:31] parallels you know but anyway yeah
[15:35] so that's amazing yeah like because
[15:38] there there are probably those two
[15:40] arguments like uh I don't I don't know
[15:42] if I could make a third one uh with with
[15:44] now having had over 400 uh podcast
[15:48] interviews in Bitcoin I have to each
[15:50] topic some some arguments but but I
[15:53] think like those two are the the the
[15:55] main arguments you could make around why
[15:58] the won't be a a better Bitcoin but you
[16:01] also sorry sorry go ahead no no yeah I
[16:04] was just agreeing because those are the
[16:06] ones that are just slam dunks there's no
[16:08] way to refute that so yeah 100% agree
[16:12] yeah yeah and um it's also interesting I
[16:15] I still get that and and people don't
[16:18] get the basics of Bitcoin like they
[16:21] don't get that it's a protocol uh and
[16:23] and once I tell them then it's a like I
[16:26] I I tell them okay like it's because
[16:29] people compare Bitcoin to MasterCard uh
[16:32] sometimes people compare also then
[16:34] Bitcoin to Facebook and Myspace like
[16:36] that that example is very popular and
[16:38] once I just calmly say like oh like but
[16:41] you're comparing a product to a protocol
[16:43] they're like oh
[16:44] like and never looked at that that way
[16:47] like yeah of course because Bitcoin is a
[16:48] protocol not a product and Facebook is a
[16:51] product not a protocol uh and they they
[16:53] are like completely mind blown by this
[16:56] this simple fact yeah like one one way
[16:58] one way I like to compare it is with
[17:00] things like uh I like to explain
[17:02] protocols with football or roads roads
[17:07] because like we are driving with huge
[17:11] two ton metal boxes at 120 komet per
[17:15] hour and honestly there's not really
[17:17] many accidents yes there's accidents but
[17:19] taking into account we're just going
[17:21] around with the energy with enough
[17:23] energy to like you know like a bullet
[17:25] there it's quite safe why because we all
[17:28] have a protocol we all understand each
[17:29] other and we know these lines they mean
[17:31] don't cross these lines they mean you
[17:33] stop here these signals signify this and
[17:36] that and that's how we all manage to
[17:38] like talk to each other and the same
[17:39] happens in many other places one of them
[17:41] is language we only understand each
[17:42] other because we speak speak the same
[17:44] protocol right we have the same rules
[17:46] for like hey here goes comes the name
[17:48] here comes the verb here comes the
[17:49] adjective right and you construct
[17:51] sentences this way this word means this
[17:53] thing this word means that thing and if
[17:55] I start changing the meaning of words
[17:57] we're not going to understand each other
[17:58] and the last one is football because
[18:00] it's very visual like football's soccer
[18:02] uh for all the Americans um like it
[18:05] we're all playing soccer we're all
[18:06] playing football we all know the rules
[18:08] and if someone touches it with the with
[18:09] it uh with the ball with their hands in
[18:13] outside of the goalkeeper's area and
[18:15] he's not a goalkeeper we all scream at
[18:17] the same time hey dude what the hell
[18:18] what are you doing that you shouldn't be
[18:19] doing that we only play with everything
[18:21] except our hands right you can touch it
[18:23] with your head you can touch it with
[18:24] your knees you can touch it with your
[18:25] chest but mostly also with your feet
[18:27] right but the moment you Break The Rules
[18:30] there's a problem and if that person
[18:31] starts screaming hey but but I want to
[18:33] play with the hands we're going to say
[18:35] great it's great that you want to do
[18:37] that but the rules are these ones we're
[18:39] playing in this field and the ball is
[18:41] ours there's another field down there
[18:44] you can go there and you can try to
[18:45] convince other people to play with you
[18:47] and that's what happens with all of the
[18:48] other cryptos and what happens is
[18:50] football is the biggest uh sport in the
[18:53] world and then you have other variants
[18:55] and other other different ways of play
[18:57] playing it oh there's CRI now we have a
[18:59] bat there's basketball now we can bounce
[19:02] it there's rugby there's right all these
[19:04] other ways but football is still number
[19:06] one because it's the most accepted right
[19:08] and everyone speaks the language of
[19:10] football we met like there's crazy
[19:12] stories like in the first World War I
[19:13] think um winter of 2000 uh 2000 1916
[19:18] right where both sides the German side
[19:20] and I think the French side they both
[19:22] went out of their trenches and for one
[19:24] night one evening they just started
[19:25] playing football even though the Germans
[19:27] couldn't speak with the French and the
[19:28] SP French couldn't speak with the
[19:29] Germans right but football United them
[19:31] why because it was a protocol and then
[19:33] you have products products are guns
[19:36] let's say in this weird case and guns in
[19:39] Wars keep changing right there's also a
[19:41] great article well article it's more
[19:42] like a an essay on from from what was it
[19:47] called like from guns to p no from from
[19:52] cryptography BPH something like that it
[19:54] was about like how um you know what are
[19:58] those arrows not not arrows like Arch I
[20:01] don't know the name right now let me
[20:02] search it like they're called uh Springs
[20:05] that's what they're called you know
[20:06] where you um click and then the arrow
[20:09] flies out like a like an automatic um
[20:13] bon in German interesting yeah do you
[20:16] know the German yeah I'm German I'm
[20:20] you're a German yeah yeah yeah I I
[20:22] thought you Spanish I'm half Spanish
[20:25] half German my mom is oh interesting
[20:28] yeah see like now 30 minutes in
[20:32] now we should have started there right
[20:34] but we
[20:35] just got going but yeah so and there's
[20:39] people actually complain about that a
[20:41] lot in in the comments because I I I
[20:44] don't like to make introductions like
[20:46] there there usually how podcast is going
[20:48] like the the podcast host usually has
[20:50] like a small list prepared of like oh
[20:53] today we are talking with XY and he is
[20:56] making this in that company and it's so
[20:58] boring for
[21:00] me and I don't want to do that I just
[21:02] want to talk with a person but I do get
[21:05] a lot of uh um a lot of feedback saying
[21:09] like oh please introduce your guest that
[21:11] we know who is speaking I was like yeah
[21:13] Bitcoin I speaking like what else do you
[21:16] need to know I mean if I guess I can
[21:20] also do a quick introduction to myself
[21:22] like or a quick like summary of who I am
[21:24] have SP although I already did kind of I
[21:26] spoke about like you know how I got
[21:28] Bitcoin all love that but anyway have
[21:30] Spanish yeah that's that's the thing
[21:32] like I think um uh you don't get it in
[21:35] the beginning uh but uh over the one
[21:38] hour usually what's happens the guest
[21:41] actually without even knowing it
[21:43] introduces himself because there are
[21:44] like small things coming along like oh
[21:46] like he's working at that company or
[21:48] that's how he got into Bitcoin or that
[21:50] that's that's probably how old he is
[21:51] like there's like all those small
[21:54] nuggets that come actually from the
[21:56] podcast and I like it uh I like that
[22:00] organic way of it's it's also like if
[22:03] you get to know someone I always find it
[22:05] weird it's like oh please introduce
[22:09] yourself like you just start a
[22:11] conversation and then you get to know
[22:13] each other while having that
[22:15] conversation quite organically but yeah
[22:17] sorry no no you're right because it's
[22:19] like imagine we're at a bar or we meet
[22:22] in some party and then I go up to you
[22:24] like hey what's up ah hey nice to meet
[22:26] you we shake hands we say hi hi I'm I'm
[22:29] Kenobi you're Robin and then I pull out
[22:31] a form with a pen and I'm like please
[22:33] fill it out you know like where do you
[22:35] work what's your age what did you study
[22:37] you know it will be like please consent
[22:39] to this conversation
[22:41] exactly so yeah 100% I agree with that
[22:44] but at the same time I understand that
[22:45] people want to know like it depends on
[22:48] your approach to podcasting right like
[22:51] if you are offering it as a as a product
[22:54] as a like pack prepackaged product you
[22:58] know like always buying the same type of
[23:00] cereal you know people just want to get
[23:02] the same thing perhaps a different taste
[23:03] perhaps different of information but
[23:05] always the same thing or if you just
[23:07] package it like CH Rogan so to speak
[23:09] where it says like hey dude I'm having
[23:11] interesting conversations with
[23:12] interesting people it depends on on what
[23:15] you want and then people the let's say
[23:16] the audience has to be responsible
[23:19] adults and choose hey I'm more of this
[23:21] type of person to and therefore this
[23:24] type of podcast or I'm more of that type
[23:26] of person and therefore more that type
[23:27] of podcast but yeah you I think I think
[23:31] the the main thing that people want to
[23:33] get confirmed is um what what
[23:37] credibility does the guest bring to the
[23:41] podcast talking about the topic because
[23:42] the topic I mean uh I try to to give
[23:46] some hints at the topic with the
[23:48] introduction so there's like a 30 to 90
[23:51] seconds introduction with some
[23:53] highlights of the podcast in that way
[23:55] you before the uh before the podcast
[23:57] starts um because usually the the first
[24:00] 20 minutes are not as interesting as the
[24:02] last 20 minutes I I I got to know like
[24:05] if a podcast is one and a half hours
[24:06] long usually the last 30 minutes or like
[24:10] the the the last like usually around 60%
[24:15] to like 90% is the most interesting part
[24:18] of every podcast because there the
[24:21] warm-up phases uh at the end and there's
[24:23] usually like this the spike in there um
[24:27] and so what you want to do is like give
[24:30] some highlights of like what are what
[24:32] are the highlights of those
[24:33] conversations that you kind of confirm
[24:35] okay like this an interesting
[24:36] conversation I want to get into that um
[24:38] and then what usually people also want
[24:41] is like okay like who's that guy like
[24:43] why credible to talk about what he's
[24:46] talking about and I've seen for example
[24:48] Diary of a CEO sorry to talk so long
[24:51] about podcast but D of Co does it really
[24:54] clever um he in the introduction he
[24:58] already has narrowed um speakings around
[25:02] the guest like not only highlights but
[25:05] also uh a second um voice that is not
[25:09] him or the the guest that is just uh
[25:13] explaining who the guest actually is an
[25:14] extremely dramatic way it's it's almost
[25:16] like a cinema trailer to to the podcast
[25:19] but he also has a team of 50 people at
[25:22] the one podcast I'm I'm I have now one
[25:25] post- production uh uh part-time help so
[25:29] congratulations I'm I'm I'm getting
[25:31] there but like still smaller thing so
[25:34] I'm I'm still thinking like all like how
[25:36] should I introduce the credibility of
[25:39] the guest without it being very boring
[25:43] in the the the intro without making it
[25:47] form form I don't know you know like a
[25:50] like a set form yeah I get that it can
[25:52] be tough cuz you want to strike the
[25:54] balance right cuz in a way that reminds
[25:56] me of um this thing my Grandpa used to
[25:58] tell me that life should be lived
[26:01] backwards meaning you should first be an
[26:04] old man then you get younger then you
[26:07] see how your uh nieces you know the you
[26:10] enjoy the time with your nieces then you
[26:12] get to be a father so to speak then you
[26:14] get to be younger then you get to study
[26:16] right because college would be much more
[26:19] enjoyable when you have already lived 70
[26:21] years because you already know how
[26:22] important knowledge is right uh and also
[26:25] kids would be more enjoyable ones you
[26:27] have already enjoyed nieces uh nieces
[26:30] nephews no um grandchildren apologies uh
[26:33] but once you have enjoyed time with your
[26:35] grandchildren then having children is
[26:37] like oh wow you have that more extra
[26:39] knowledge you already know what to do
[26:40] right um and then by the time you get
[26:42] you you're young you already know what
[26:43] it fa like to have an old body and a
[26:46] rusty body now you get to truly take
[26:48] care of that but of course that's not
[26:50] how life works and you need to do the
[26:51] proof of work first before you get to
[26:53] enjoy right you first need to have
[26:55] children before you get to enjoy the
[26:56] grandchildren so in a way that's the
[26:59] same happens with podcast right you need
[27:01] to go through the through the
[27:02] introduction through the explanation
[27:05] through the laying the the foundation
[27:07] before you can get to the interesting
[27:09] part of like the the insides the the the
[27:13] golden nuggets right that that people
[27:15] sometimes drop so yeah I get that
[27:18] absolutely and but but that's why we
[27:19] have so many different formas like that
[27:21] like shorts from the podcast there clips
[27:23] from the podcast shorts under 30 seconds
[27:25] clips from like one minutes so like 5 10
[27:27] minutes
[27:29] you can cut things out if it's really
[27:30] valuable even the community does it on
[27:32] its own like oh like I like that five
[27:33] minutes so much I cut it out and put it
[27:35] on social media myself uh and I and I do
[27:38] enjoy that like uh there there are so
[27:41] many clips of let's put stick with the
[27:44] chogan example there's so many CH Rogan
[27:47] Clips out there on every platform that
[27:49] he didn't produce because people find it
[27:52] enjoyable and if something is really
[27:54] good in the podcast it it will find its
[27:56] way in the internet that that's a great
[27:58] a great thing like I I love seeing more
[28:00] and more Community Clips on Twitter just
[28:02] getting out thrown out there um and by
[28:05] the way I try to mention it every other
[28:08] podcast you can actually do this with my
[28:10] podcast I don't want to have any credit
[28:13] for that like my podcast is open source
[28:16] you can take any clips and just like
[28:17] post it wherever you want you can even
[28:19] make advertisement with it I've put the
[28:22] the YouTube creative comments license uh
[28:24] in there you just just take it and do
[28:27] whatever you want with
[28:29] it yeah that that that's I think the
[28:31] approach to con creation I think we we
[28:34] we we benefit all of us benefit if we
[28:38] collaborate as much as possible yeah but
[28:40] maybe coming back to what you said
[28:44] before uh maybe coming back to the
[28:46] protocol and rules that uh it's really
[28:48] interesting uh uh because you also
[28:51] mentioned that War I have a I have a a
[28:53] similar story actually I was in Egypt uh
[28:56] playing beach volleyball
[28:58] uh when uh the Russia Ukraine war broke
[29:02] out and I played mostly beach volleball
[29:06] with Russians and Ukraine uh and and it
[29:09] was kind of a weird time because you saw
[29:14] in the news how uh Russia and and
[29:18] Ukraine are having all of a sudden this
[29:19] war and then you see Russians and
[29:22] Ukraine playing beach volleyball uh and
[29:26] and and loving every second of it uh so
[29:29] that that's this weird thing also that
[29:30] that that like sports is kind of
[29:33] connecting it sometimes uh but it's it
[29:36] speaks to the the this rule set of like
[29:39] yeah you know Beach B about you know
[29:41] soccer like it's you you just accept the
[29:44] rules and and you play in them there
[29:46] there maybe uh with beach volleyball
[29:49] there's people that don't know exact
[29:51] rules but with soccer like most
[29:53] especially in Europe everyone knows the
[29:55] rules it's it's quite simple uh and that
[29:58] that's the main advantage of having
[29:59] those those strict rule sets and having
[30:01] them um apply to everyone exactly yeah
[30:05] football don't touch it with your hands
[30:07] right don't touch the ball with your
[30:08] hands in Bitcoin don't spend a utxo that
[30:11] you don't have or don't ever spend more
[30:14] Bitcoins than what you have this way we
[30:16] avoid 21 million right like surpassing
[30:18] the 21 million so having a hard cap so
[30:21] yeah 100% I agree I partnered up with
[30:24] coin vigilante this is the most
[30:27] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[30:30] saw created by anyone look at that
[30:33] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[30:35] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[30:38] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[30:42] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[30:44] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[30:48] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[30:50] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[30:54] watch collections you have the date of
[30:57] the first never mind Bitcoin Block in
[31:00] there and of course also the block
[31:02] height and which Epoch we are currently
[31:05] in I love the level of detail they put
[31:08] in in this masterpiece and make sure to
[31:11] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[31:14] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[31:16] love those watches so so much if you
[31:20] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[31:22] regular basis I guess you already bought
[31:24] some Bitcoin and now the most important
[31:27] step is to keep the Bitcoin keep them
[31:30] secure in a hardware wallet my personal
[31:33] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[31:34] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[31:37] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[31:39] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[31:42] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[31:46] with the code Robin at the checkout
[31:48] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[31:52] your bitbox and the next step is to
[31:54] really level up your sovereignty as an
[31:57] individual
[31:58] you have to have the most secure self-
[32:00] custody setup you have to secure your
[32:03] own devices you have to protect your
[32:06] privacy you have to set up an
[32:08] inheritance plan and depending on where
[32:10] you live you even want to have a plan B
[32:13] a citizenship where you can move in case
[32:16] something goes really really wrong and
[32:18] through all those steps the Bitcoin way
[32:20] is guiding you through step by step and
[32:23] if you visit the Bitcoin way.com SLP
[32:26] partners in you even get a 30 minute
[32:29] free call to find out how you can level
[32:32] up your sovereignty interesting it's
[32:35] also one thing um because we talked
[32:37] about the tcpap protocol one thing about
[32:40] Bitcoin it's super interesting is that
[32:42] we have a token uh not only the the
[32:45] network uh Bitcoin and the protocol of
[32:48] itself but we also have a token to it
[32:50] that we can buy and has an um has has a
[32:54] value and an exchange rate this we
[32:57] didn't have with internet and it would
[32:59] and it was so fun to think about like
[33:01] what if there was like an underlying TCP
[33:04] token like that that you could buy and
[33:06] then like how different would the the
[33:10] the the story of the internet would have
[33:12] been if if there's something like that
[33:13] in the internet it doesn't really make
[33:15] sense but maybe that TCP token is now uh
[33:20] Bitcoin and I just kind of wanted to
[33:22] have your thoughts with like the
[33:23] protocol and and Bitcoin being maybe
[33:26] that token of the interet that's an
[33:28] interesting thought because in a way
[33:29] because I recently read the the Genesis
[33:31] Book by Aon van wdom uh hopefully I
[33:35] didn't butcher his name um and in a way
[33:38] you do realize that the people building
[33:40] the internet were also the people
[33:42] building Bitcoin not all of them
[33:44] achieved it right only one of them or a
[33:47] group of them soshi Nakamoto managed to
[33:48] do that um but in a way it was like uh
[33:53] like the same people could have actually
[33:55] implemented it on the same place and
[33:57] also
[33:58] it could have actually happened with
[34:00] David Cha's um thing like he had an
[34:03] Amsterdam some startup I don't remember
[34:05] the name dig digicash right um which as
[34:09] Adon explains apparently everything that
[34:11] David sha did he tried to have the DC so
[34:16] like David cha H he always tried to have
[34:20] everything start with d and c um and he
[34:22] did have that and apparently like
[34:24] Microsoft was very close to integrating
[34:26] digicash into all of its operating
[34:29] system that would have been a a huge
[34:31] jump in the amount of users using
[34:33] digicash but in a way it's good that
[34:35] everything else failed and it's good
[34:38] that the internet didn't have a coin
[34:40] because if it had had a coin or they
[34:42] have they they would have manag to get a
[34:44] coin like one of two they either would
[34:47] have created bitcoin in which case we
[34:49] would have had Bitcoin much earlier
[34:50] which could have been positive could
[34:52] have been negative we don't know uh
[34:54] right that's one of the problems of
[34:55] social sciences um you never know like
[34:58] the what could have happened you can
[35:00] only speculate um and and the other
[35:03] thing is so they they could have managed
[35:06] to to create Bitcoin or they could have
[35:08] just created something much worse than
[35:10] just another Fiat shitcoin that would
[35:13] have eventually required the creation of
[35:16] Bitcoin either way so in a way it's good
[35:19] that you know like things happen
[35:22] separately because in a way they're
[35:23] separate Bitcoin doesn't need the
[35:25] Internet we like
[35:28] we could Bitcoin would still work even
[35:30] if the internet shut down it would just
[35:32] be much more janky and much worse it's
[35:35] like saying hey could I use my car if
[35:37] all of the road networks disappeared you
[35:40] still could you could still drive your
[35:42] Volkswagen your uh your Toyotas around
[35:45] places would they break much off much
[35:48] more often would it be much more
[35:49] annoying 100% but in a way you would
[35:51] still be able to do that do that and
[35:53] with Bitcoin it's the same just that the
[35:55] internet is that already laid out
[35:58] infrastructure that we are enjoying that
[36:00] we are using to power Bitcoin but we by
[36:03] no means need it right because Bitcoin
[36:05] we can send transactions via um via text
[36:09] messages via uh like um what's it called
[36:12] like long waves uh radio waves FM uh no
[36:16] AM radio waves we can send them in any
[36:20] we could even send them with like
[36:21] pigeons because you could just write
[36:24] down either the zeros and ones or the or
[36:26] or in whichever format you put it in a
[36:28] paper you give it to the pigeon and he
[36:30] flies to wherever else the other nodes
[36:32] are connected interconnected and that's
[36:34] it and then your transaction is
[36:36] broadcasted to the network so we don't
[36:39] really need the Internet so it's anyway
[36:41] that that's once again another detour
[36:43] but yeah yeah it's I heard this one
[36:47] interesting quote like the internet is
[36:49] only here to enable Bitcoin even better
[36:52] like like to to to power up Bitcoin on a
[36:55] global scale um it's it's really
[36:57] interesting and it's it's magical for me
[36:59] like that that we have Bitcoin when you
[37:02] when you think about the Bitcoin history
[37:04] on how many point it could have broken
[37:07] but it never did that that's kind of
[37:11] really magical for me do you do
[37:14] you do do you think it's a discovery or
[37:18] invention oh I've heard it's so many
[37:21] different ways and I've been like
[37:22] flip-flopping from one side to the other
[37:25] cuz like what was it I think I think it
[37:29] was like an invention not a discovery
[37:32] because but I don't really care like in
[37:34] a way that's also something I've been
[37:35] saying lately because people say oh what
[37:38] is bitcoin is it an asset is it a token
[37:40] is it a like is it a coin is it an asset
[37:42] is it I don't and I'm like who gives a
[37:45] single flying [ __ ] sorry for the f bomb
[37:48] but like uh who cares it's here deal
[37:51] with it like who cares if powder is like
[37:55] plantbased powder or or made out of
[37:57] carbon or just a chemical solution who
[38:00] gives a [ __ ] when bullets are flying in
[38:02] your direction powered by powder by
[38:05] black powder right you don't care when
[38:07] you're there someone's shooting at you
[38:08] when someone's using that technology you
[38:10] don't care if oh my God does it follow
[38:12] ESG
[38:13] rules nobody cares you know like it's
[38:17] just here you have to deal with it you
[38:20] can complain about it that's a way to
[38:22] deal with it but don't be surprised if
[38:24] in 10 years 20 years no you're not here
[38:27] to complain or nobody listens to you
[38:29] right so that's the other thing right so
[38:33] I I these questions they're super
[38:34] interesting and super philosophical but
[38:36] I'm not the smartest person to talk
[38:38] about that I'm much more qualified to
[38:40] talk about Bitcoin mining and like the
[38:41] history of Bitcoin mining and
[38:43] communities and Spain and you know
[38:46] European level and education and being a
[38:48] student and also being a bitcoiner that
[38:49] type of stuff that than that even though
[38:53] I already gave an answer so but anyway I
[38:56] think your answer was actually good good
[38:57] uh on the HG thing it's also related the
[39:00] first topic that is related to Bitcoin
[39:02] mining are you still hearing that that
[39:04] mining uh thought that that like mining
[39:07] is very energy um intensive or like it's
[39:12] a waste of energy is that still in for
[39:15] for me it really slowed down yes yes it
[39:18] really slowed down but also since I've
[39:21] been let's say moving from one company
[39:25] to another so I used to work for a
[39:27] Bitcoin minor um so bit of background on
[39:31] on myself so people understand why I'm
[39:32] saying that so when I got summer of 2022
[39:36] I entered the no summer of 2021
[39:38] apologies right right as the China
[39:41] Bitcoin mining ban was happening I
[39:43] started at the Bitcoin mining company um
[39:47] as an intern summer intern and I was two
[39:49] years down with my college my economics
[39:51] degree but that's when I got orange
[39:53] built in there not because of the
[39:55] company itself something I've realized
[39:57] with the my past what is it now four
[40:00] years in the Bing industry is that well
[40:02] almost four is that most of bit of the
[40:05] Bitcoin mining companies they're just
[40:07] Fiat mining like they're just Fiat
[40:09] companies that just found a different
[40:11] source of Revenue that's it um like
[40:14] especially the publicly traded ones and
[40:16] the big ones they can say whatever their
[40:17] marketing department can say whatever
[40:19] but you know like when R wherever meets
[40:22] the road that's the truth but anyway I
[40:24] got the chance to Orange fill myself to
[40:26] learn about bit coin and actually that
[40:28] happened when I learned about how proof
[40:30] of work works like the day that proof of
[40:32] work clicked for me that's the no point
[40:34] of no return right um so then I ended up
[40:37] working for a full year with them first
[40:39] as an intern then as a part-time student
[40:41] while I was doing my arasmus in Manheim
[40:43] and then uh full-time and um for for for
[40:47] that semester I didn't go to co to
[40:49] college back in Barcelona and I just
[40:51] kept working and then I started my
[40:55] college again and that's when I started
[40:56] doing meetups in Barcelona and also
[40:59] being like doing more volunteer work
[41:01] going to conferences that type of stuff
[41:05] um and for about a year and a half
[41:08] that's what I kept doing I kept learning
[41:09] economics Fiat economics but well it's
[41:12] different to learn fat economics when
[41:13] you already know real economics or not
[41:15] real but like Austrian economics or
[41:17] other points of view because something
[41:18] that I'm also very interested in is uh
[41:20] on behavioral economics and how
[41:23] that contrasts with Austrian economics
[41:26] because many times s in austro economics
[41:29] we have this like Mickey Mouse creating
[41:32] assum Mickey Mouse model where we create
[41:34] a lot of assumptions and we assume that
[41:36] everyone's rational and everyone has
[41:37] perfect information and all that right
[41:40] um the homoeconomicus right and then you
[41:42] read stuff about behavioral economics
[41:43] and how come the same cake if it's
[41:47] priced at $5 or $50 per piece it tastes
[41:50] different or people say it tastes
[41:51] different right that's super interesting
[41:53] and that's not really rational right so
[41:55] anyway that's a different topic so I
[41:57] finished my studies last year and before
[42:00] I I I I finished my my degree I I was
[42:04] invited back into the company to keep
[42:05] working part-time on Bitcoin mining
[42:07] stuff also for for that Hiatus as I was
[42:11] studying I kept doing Bitcoin mining
[42:12] stuff uh mostly Bitcoin mining analysis
[42:15] because that's what I'm good at Bitcoin
[42:17] mining analysis uh Business Development
[42:20] um on the Bitcoin mining and Bitcoin in
[42:22] general um and they invited me back and
[42:25] then as I graduated I told him thank you
[42:27] for the ride but I want to see New
[42:30] Horizons and I recently joined the
[42:32] company uh the team at demand pool and
[42:34] we're deploying the first stratum V2
[42:36] pool so like that's that explains also a
[42:42] main reason why it's gotten quieter for
[42:44] me because I went from being with the
[42:46] miners right and that those are the ones
[42:48] getting most of the hate or most of the
[42:49] fud to being with a pool but regardless
[42:53] of that having a pulse on the mining
[42:55] industry I've definitely noticed that
[42:58] the efforts by especially Daniel baton
[43:00] have pushed down and toned down Daniel
[43:03] baton Bitcoin policy institude Troy
[43:06] Margo P like this entire cohort of
[43:09] people um they have definitely like
[43:13] dispelled most of the F on an
[43:15] Institutional level that's the caveat
[43:19] because on a on a citizen level on a on
[43:22] a you know like on a broader level
[43:25] there's there there's been so many years
[43:26] of disinformation there's been so many
[43:28] years of fud there's been so many years
[43:31] of lies that I'm still getting sometimes
[43:34] that question of oh but doesn't it use
[43:36] too much energy or oh but isn't it bad
[43:39] for the environment and it's not coming
[43:41] from any company it's coming from people
[43:44] and then but this time at least now
[43:46] compared to before we can we actually
[43:49] have data and we have studies and we can
[43:51] very calmly Say You're Just plainly
[43:53] wrong and they're and they because they
[43:55] don't really have an opinion they just
[43:56] have heard about it they just go like oh
[43:59] I'm sorry okay yeah but but how and you
[44:01] just explain it to them look you know
[44:04] renewable energies they're destroying
[44:05] the grid they're making it more unstable
[44:07] we're actually powering it we're
[44:09] plugging the the hole where the renew
[44:12] that the Renewables have been making in
[44:13] the grid uh furthermore when you compare
[44:15] to other Industries in in the
[44:18] similar in similar categories like
[44:20] banking for example like or the US
[44:22] dollar how is the US dollar uh backed o
[44:26] what the US Army interesting how many
[44:30] CO2 emissions do they have oh what are
[44:32] you seeing a 100 times more than the
[44:34] entire Bitcoin Network that's curious
[44:37] and they also bring death and
[44:39] destruction behind them interesting
[44:41] Bitcoin has never done that you know
[44:42] Bitcoin has never killed anyone so
[44:45] perhaps that's not a real like perhaps
[44:47] if that's a complaint that you have you
[44:49] shouldn't be pointing it to bitcoin and
[44:50] Bitcoin mining you should be pointing it
[44:52] at the US dollar and US dollar
[44:55] sovereignty or or us do mining if you
[44:57] might right like perhaps that's where
[45:00] you should be directing your complaints
[45:02] at not Bitcoin and people very quickly
[45:04] because that's the thing when you have
[45:07] either worked in the industry or studied
[45:09] Bitcoin or or have informed yourself
[45:11] done a bit of the proof of work you can
[45:13] then mint blocks so to speak right you
[45:15] have the proof of work on your side and
[45:18] the other person what do they know they
[45:20] just read two or three um titles uh news
[45:25] titles and that's it they they're now
[45:28] informed right so it's very easy to
[45:30] nowadays dispel that and say you know
[45:33] what get back to where you came from
[45:35] this is not like you're looking
[45:38] dumb absolutely it's also interesting
[45:41] how
[45:42] how what what we know Bitcoin is and how
[45:46] the average person that hasn't studied
[45:49] Bitcoin yet thinks Bitcoin is and what
[45:52] are this the different uh narratives
[45:55] around Bitcoin and and one one thing
[45:58] that I'm also like never connected
[46:01] because yeah those there are those
[46:02] studies that show like people say a cake
[46:05] that cost $7 is is better than a cake
[46:08] and it's $5 like all all those all those
[46:10] things and even like the the color of
[46:12] the pl it's surfed on like it makes a
[46:14] difference and like this all plays in
[46:17] there and and I never connected that to
[46:19] like how differently people now see
[46:22] Bitcoin was like five years ago where it
[46:25] was like a 10K now it's like at 100 k um
[46:28] from an Aver like bitcoiners don't view
[46:30] it differently I think like I don't
[46:32] generally view it differently I learn a
[46:35] lot about Bitcoin in the last five years
[46:37] but I don't see different leads uh
[46:39] because of the price it's more about the
[46:40] learnings I
[46:41] had what what do you think is the the
[46:43] the impact of of of the price of Bitcoin
[46:46] is it similar with compared to a
[46:50] cake people view it in a in a in a
[46:52] better light or does it make things
[46:55] worse I think sadly it makes things
[46:58] worse because um people are not aware of
[47:01] the fact that you can actually subdivide
[47:03] Bitcoins into 100 million units called
[47:06] Satoshi right and also the problem is
[47:09] that many people don't understand
[47:11] because they still think it's a product
[47:13] they don't understand that this protocol
[47:16] it can and it most likely will eat up a
[47:21] huge chunk of the world's value and they
[47:24] don't I don't they think that I got here
[47:27] too late right the classic oh but I and
[47:30] especially going back to the whole like
[47:31] students and younger people um
[47:34] conversation I I've I've been having
[47:35] this conversation with my friends I mean
[47:37] at this point we're a bit older we're
[47:38] like from 25 to 28 years old right um
[47:42] and we're starting to make money and
[47:43] we're starting to have savings but of
[47:45] course we're in Spain we're not making
[47:47] like 5K a month like in the US we're
[47:50] making perhaps a tops 2,000 2,500 after
[47:54] taxes um that's because of a the Spanish
[47:57] tax system anyway it's a huge lie you
[48:00] are always kind of paying 50% income
[48:03] taxes uh but that's a different topic um
[48:07] and of course people like my friends
[48:08] they ask me like but what's the point
[48:10] like if I only have $100 $200 right like
[48:14] a month to save what's the point or
[48:16] Euros um and I'm like well you're
[48:20] looking at it from like a like a warped
[48:23] perspective you think it's already too
[48:25] high but you don't see that you're just
[48:28] not even a hundredth of the way there
[48:31] like Bitcoin is not even close to its
[48:33] maximum potential um and also you're not
[48:36] looking at the other Alternatives and
[48:38] adjusting for risk and also for effort
[48:41] because I have because something that we
[48:43] do in finance a lot is um risk adjusted
[48:45] returns but something that I've also
[48:47] started to do is risk and effort
[48:50] adjusted returns because especially as a
[48:52] Bitcoin miner lots of people come to me
[48:54] and like well Bitcoin mining analyst
[48:56] lots of people come to like oh hey
[48:57] Kenobi should I start doing Bitcoin
[48:59] mining like hey I want to buy some
[49:00] machines and you start doing Bitcoin
[49:02] mining I'm like
[49:04] look it's great idea like everyone wants
[49:07] to do it and we need to decentralize the
[49:09] network but like as an advice for
[49:12] you when you adjust the Returns on Fiat
[49:16] terms and even on bitcoin terms to the
[49:19] risk that you're taking on with Bitcoin
[49:22] mining and also to the effort because as
[49:24] a hodler you just buy every month buy
[49:27] every week or buy whenever you feel like
[49:28] it you never sell and you sleep like a
[49:31] baby you don't care you don't need to do
[49:33] any TA no one else or anything but as a
[49:35] minor you're first of all starting on
[49:38] the negative there's a negative cash
[49:40] flow you you send who knows 50k so have
[49:43] a Bitcoin to get a few machines and also
[49:46] the electrical infrastructure so you're
[49:47] starting in the hole and you need to
[49:50] work all the way all the way back up
[49:52] sometimes it works out sometimes it
[49:54] doesn't because the difficulty uh runs
[49:56] away from you so to speak and the
[49:58] electricity prices also become too uh
[50:01] much higher that's something that
[50:02] happened in Winter of 2022 um where
[50:05] suddenly we had what I called the the
[50:07] double G Guillotine because we had
[50:09] difficulty coming from from the bottom
[50:11] and uh now the price coming from from
[50:14] the top and dropping so decreasing the
[50:16] hash price so decreasing the returns but
[50:18] also Energy prices here in Europe going
[50:21] up and the miners in Europe were being
[50:24] hypers squeezed like double Guillotine
[50:26] right like the that's why we have no
[50:28] industry anymore uh regarding Bitcoin
[50:30] mining in Europe I mean there's a bid in
[50:32] north and Norway but even three years
[50:35] ago it was much bigger than what it is
[50:36] today right um so I tell them that and
[50:39] it's like look when you're just for risk
[50:42] and you're just for returns um an effort
[50:46] I mean when you're just for risk an
[50:47] effort Bitcoin mining doesn't usually
[50:50] make sense like it's just not worth it
[50:54] like just huddle
[50:56] and you'll be happy so to speak yeah I
[50:59] don't did I answer your
[51:02] question yeah and and more of it okay
[51:05] good because I just went on a on a rant
[51:07] here yeah um with I think the original
[51:11] one was like uh the different perception
[51:13] of the price of Bitcoin yeah but I think
[51:16] it's it's it's a it's a really good one
[51:18] it's also some like it's never really
[51:19] too late to adopt a good money and and I
[51:23] like the way you brought up like the the
[51:25] alternative because are like but Bitcoin
[51:28] is like it's it's not going high and
[51:30] like okay but even if if that's true
[51:34] like even if you uh if I think the the
[51:37] the the limit is now
[51:39] reached why don't you consider the
[51:41] fundamental thing of what Bitcoin is um
[51:45] and if your money because I can also
[51:48] guarantee you the euro is not going
[51:50] higher the other thing it's like it's
[51:53] like you have consider the the
[51:54] opportunity cost of like where is your
[51:56] bit where's your money now and and where
[51:58] is it going and it's never too late to
[52:00] adopt the best strategy possible and
[52:03] Bitcoin is the best strategy possible
[52:05] yeah then there's also something that
[52:06] I've been starting to say uh to my
[52:09] friends of my my age because in my
[52:11] generation you know people that are like
[52:13] well my generation I'm below so to speak
[52:16] uh although Robin how old are you if I
[52:18] can ask uh 26 26 hey you're you're also
[52:22] part of my generation 1999 or
[52:25] 1998 uh eight 1998 oh okay well now
[52:28] we're enemies forever 1999 better than
[52:32] 98 no I'm kidding I no no actually uh I
[52:36] I I would love to have 99 because I my
[52:39] birthday is the the the 9th of September
[52:41] so
[52:42] 99 like the N the 99 98 so if I had the
[52:47] same date with like 99 that would be
[52:49] that would be really cool birth that
[52:51] would be very clean that would be very
[52:52] clean certified clean but anyway anyway
[52:56] I I bet I bet you know this as well like
[52:58] in our generation having a house like
[53:01] our friends like there's no hope for
[53:04] that and the usual joke like that I've
[53:06] heard all the time is like haha the
[53:09] Boomers they bought their houses for
[53:11] like 32 strawberries and now they're
[53:13] selling them for $2 million
[53:15] [ __ ] right and I'm like guys do
[53:18] you realize that we are the Boomers in
[53:21] the 70s like but instead of real estate
[53:25] it's Bitcoin like in 20 years in 30
[53:28] years in 40 years people will look at us
[53:30] and be like you absolute douche you
[53:34] could you could have bought five houses
[53:36] so to speak right for for just $20,000
[53:40] each right which is nothing right in
[53:43] this case it would be like you could
[53:44] have bought a a few a few Z 0.1 Bitcoin
[53:49] for just a few thousand EUR now it's
[53:51] sitting at 22 million now it's sitting
[53:53] at 50 million right
[53:57] what did you do in your 70 in the 70s in
[53:59] the 80s right like why didn't you buy
[54:01] more houses right and we're literally
[54:03] those people they're going to be
[54:04] complaining about us because we had the
[54:05] chance to buy Bitcoin under one under
[54:08] one million and we're going to be able
[54:10] to like sell it although I don't believe
[54:12] we should sell it we if anything we
[54:14] should exchange it for goods and
[54:15] services but in a way that's selling it
[54:17] right from a purchasing power
[54:18] perspective we will be selling it at a
[54:21] much higher level and and of course
[54:23] people are going to the same way that we
[54:25] make memes about
[54:27] Boomers like oh my God they bought their
[54:29] houses for nothing and now they're
[54:30] selling them for a lot people are going
[54:31] to be making memes about us of like oh
[54:33] my God they bought Bitcoin at $100,000
[54:36] even if it was just like 500 EUR that
[54:38] they put in and now they're being able
[54:40] to sell it or exchange it for a Mercedes
[54:43] for example like think about it right
[54:46] like so so yeah that's something I've
[54:48] been telling friends and family like uh
[54:50] guys we are in the 70s and we are the
[54:53] Boomers when you buy five houses
[54:56] seven houses stretch yourself a little
[54:59] bit thinner to have that much more real
[55:01] estate and now in 2020 2025 be like the
[55:05] king well we it's the 70s but instead of
[55:08] real estate it's Bitcoin you're you're
[55:12] yeah you probably have talked about that
[55:14] that Meme I just searched it it's it's
[55:16] actually like as you said two million
[55:18] actually the the original meme uh and
[55:21] just for the people that listening uh it
[55:23] it says Boomer selling their homes for 2
[55:25] million after buying them in 969 for
[55:29] seven raspberries uh and it's basically
[55:31] some some Boomer dancing and it's just a
[55:33] hilarious video it's great and the
[55:36] people will make the same thing with
[55:37] Bitcoin like that that's 100% sure you
[55:39] you you can you can copy that now and
[55:42] you can clip that video in in in let's
[55:45] say uh 30 years yeah 40 years 50 years
[55:49] and the the same except meme will be
[55:52] there with Bitcoin uh because it will be
[55:55] true and and I mean I mean to some
[55:57] extent it's already true like there are
[56:00] websites uh if you go like 12 years back
[56:03] in the in the in the past where you get
[56:06] for entering an email address five
[56:08] Bitcoin yeah like oh like the me will be
[56:11] like oh he got five Bitcoin for one
[56:14] email address and five Bitcoin will be
[56:16] like the equivalent of multiple homes
[56:19] like almost half cities uh so it will be
[56:21] like such ridiculous thing and and it's
[56:25] it's it's it it will I'm really looking
[56:27] forward to those me for for some reason
[56:29] that Meme really spreads joy in me and
[56:34] but the good part is that so there's
[56:36] also something about the very very sad
[56:40] about this real estate and how it was
[56:42] turned into this great investment and
[56:45] it's the fact that the great investment
[56:47] of one generation is the unaffordable
[56:49] housing of the next one right but the
[56:51] difference with Bitcoin is that you
[56:53] don't need Bitcoin to live in inside of
[56:56] it it right you don't live inside of of
[56:58] your investment and people put that as a
[57:00] bad thing but in a way the fact that in
[57:02] 40 50 years our great investment will be
[57:06] sold to the Next Generation doesn't mean
[57:09] that they will not be able to live
[57:11] somewhere like we're not taking away
[57:12] their housing like it's happening
[57:13] nowadays right so that's another one of
[57:16] those extra things like the whole thing
[57:18] of like Bitcoin is better than gold
[57:20] because gold it's us people usually
[57:22] defend gold um as a better store of
[57:25] value than bit
[57:26] oh because there's industrial us users
[57:29] but then the people that actually know
[57:30] the truth is like actually that muddies
[57:32] the water that makes it worse for
[57:34] everyone else and the same with housing
[57:36] housing it H has let's say domestic uses
[57:39] but then if you use it as a store of
[57:41] value you're diminishing the space for
[57:45] the domestic use because you're using it
[57:47] as a store of value and therefore people
[57:49] like you and I were priced out of a
[57:51] house but what other use than store
[57:54] value does Bitcoin have we're not
[57:56] pricing out anyone else right so that's
[57:59] going to be one of the let's say Silver
[58:01] Linings of Bitcoin becoming the store
[58:04] value for the next 40 years instead of
[58:07] real estate so yeah anyway that's that's
[58:09] my two SATs there and uh the the third
[58:13] side would be
[58:15] [Music]
[58:16] uh that I think is really important to
[58:19] add um Bitcoin is a pro of work system
[58:23] uh and uh you could say that also about
[58:26] about homes about real estate uh but
[58:28] because it's so connected to the credit
[58:30] Market it's actually not like if if you
[58:33] have like five homes it's way easier to
[58:34] get like the the 50th one yeah so so um
[58:40] with Bitcoin just because you have five
[58:43] Bitcoin doesn't mean the sixth one gets
[58:45] easier just because of the fact of five
[58:48] Bitcoin because every Bitcoin requires
[58:50] for you to work for it either to buy it
[58:53] with money or to actually work for it uh
[58:55] and this is a whole different system
[58:57] than the Fiat system and yes there's
[59:00] this argument like oh like there there
[59:02] will be Fiat products with Bitcoin and
[59:04] then you can borrow out your five
[59:06] Bitcoin and get L six one very easily
[59:08] and the can billionaire effect is the
[59:10] same but just because the Fiat system
[59:13] does that also with Bitcoin doesn't mean
[59:15] Bitcoin is wrong it's a Fiat system but
[59:18] also there's a huge difference everyone
[59:20] will have the same opportunities because
[59:22] right now the caner effect the can yeah
[59:26] canalone effect doesn't apply to
[59:29] something that everyone can do it only
[59:31] applies to the unequal access to the
[59:34] money
[59:34] printer right so if I have dinner with
[59:39] Christine lagard and you don't my
[59:41] company will survive and yours won't
[59:43] right or I will you know get more funds
[59:47] than yours right but with under Bitcoin
[59:50] nobody can print more Bitcoin like that
[59:53] that's that's that's impossible you
[59:55] cannot do it so therefore even if you
[59:59] can take on more risk because getting on
[60:02] Leverage like getting out debt to buy
[60:04] your six Bitcoin it just means you're
[60:06] taking more risk and you could end up
[60:08] with actually three Bitcoins instead of
[60:10] six because you that was a bet it went
[60:13] wrong like you I bet that if I take this
[60:16] loan I will not lose and I can get an
[60:18] extra Bitcoin for free but it's never
[60:21] for free because there's always risk and
[60:23] it's always a probability and one out of
[60:25] 10 times one out of 100 times so if 100
[60:28] people did it let's say 10 10 of them
[60:30] would actually lose three Bitcoins each
[60:33] and that's how the other ones kind of so
[60:35] to speak managed to get risk-free that
[60:38] extra Bitcoin it's not risk-free it's
[60:40] just that by sheer luck they didn't have
[60:43] bad luck and they are in the good
[60:45] scenario not the bad scenario but of
[60:47] course you repeat that enough times like
[60:49] you repeat flipping a coin and seeing
[60:52] how many times you get uh the number
[60:54] like heads uh in a row at some point
[60:57] you're gonna get get it wrong right and
[60:59] that's when everything collapses in a
[61:01] way that's also what we're doing with
[61:02] the economy and that's why printing
[61:03] money is bad because if we had
[61:06] more like frequent smaller crises we
[61:10] would be cleaning out the forest more
[61:12] times and we would not allow the all of
[61:14] the debris all of the dry matter to
[61:17] accumulate and then suddenly there's a
[61:19] spark and like it happens here in Spain
[61:21] it happens in California it happens in
[61:22] Australia suddenly the entire Forest is
[61:25] on fire right ah but it only happens
[61:27] every 20 years oh great but we don't
[61:29] have a forest then right so that's
[61:32] that's the big difference with um with
[61:34] the Bitcoin system versus the the Fiat
[61:37] system it's the fact that we're all
[61:39] equal and nobody has this
[61:42] extra uh Joker card that they can play
[61:45] when things go wrong for them and we
[61:47] cannot use
[61:49] that and then we create a system where
[61:52] the best ideas wi and not the ideas that
[61:55] are closest the money printer exactly
[61:58] there you go you said it much better
[61:59] than I
[62:00] did it was just a a one sentence
[62:04] summary uh but but it's it's really uh
[62:07] it's really interesting uh that um one
[62:10] thing that I've noted down in the
[62:12] beginning what you said which would be
[62:14] an interesting thing to talk about is
[62:16] what a Bitcoin Max is that you remember
[62:19] right in the beginning of like those two
[62:21] things that that you brought up and I
[62:23] think um uh you you seem like a really
[62:27] uh based bitcoiner of like having very
[62:32] um straightforward few of of of Bitcoin
[62:35] um so so what is for you a a Bitcoin
[62:39] Maxi and and and would you yourself
[62:42] describe yourself as one I mean that's
[62:44] the problem right um you're you're
[62:47] basically asking me to put a bar and say
[62:49] am I above it or below it right and
[62:51] usually that's a conflict of interest
[62:53] because I'm the regulator and also the
[62:56] regulate it right because I'm putting
[62:57] the bar and I'm choosing I'm top above
[62:59] or below it right
[63:02] um I I I would Define myself as a
[63:04] Bitcoin maximalist um but I feel like I
[63:07] put the bar both at the same time in a
[63:09] paradoxical way much lower but also much
[63:11] higher because in a way I feel like you
[63:14] should be able like for example
[63:15] something I used to say is that ethereum
[63:18] did have did provide certain level of
[63:21] value when it was proof of work cuz it
[63:23] was provably something that nobody else
[63:26] had done and that's a decentralized
[63:28] computer there were all of these gpus
[63:29] that allowed you to do decentralized
[63:31] Computing illegal Computing if you might
[63:33] want right North Korea doesn't want you
[63:35] to do that transaction or that
[63:36] computation you can push it onto the
[63:38] gpus of the ethereum network ideally
[63:40] right it was a bit you know not really
[63:43] but whatever uh so right that that's a
[63:45] bit of value it does not mean not even
[63:48] close that ethereum is anything like
[63:51] Bitcoin it's completely different right
[63:53] but it doesn't mean that it doesn't have
[63:55] didn't have any value right um so I
[63:58] consider myself a maxi in the sense that
[64:00] there's only one money there's only
[64:01] going to be one money most likely
[64:03] Bitcoin uh but that doesn't mean that
[64:05] everything else is [ __ ] but we have to
[64:07] be very clear and that's the problem
[64:09] right being very clear depends on who
[64:11] you talk to if I'm talking to you it can
[64:12] be very clear and you can understand the
[64:14] nuances but when I'm talking to a [ __ ]
[64:17] coiner or when I'm talking to a nocoiner
[64:19] I cannot say like oh yeah there's also a
[64:21] bit of value here or there or for
[64:23] example Monero I think Monero is the
[64:24] perfect example cuz it had a fair launch
[64:27] and as ja muko presented it on Baltic
[64:30] Honeybadger 2022 I believe or 2023 uh
[64:34] there's hard money that's Bitcoin it's
[64:36] useful it's Cypher Punk and then there's
[64:38] dark money they can both not coexist at
[64:41] the same time because if you have dark
[64:42] money you cannot verifiably
[64:44] transparently audit it that's Bitcoin
[64:46] but if you can verifiably transparently
[64:48] audit it then everyone can do it
[64:51] included the government included your
[64:52] enemies so therefore having a dark money
[64:54] is also interesting but of course for
[64:56] the savings purpose that's the main
[64:57] problem with Fiat right um the the
[65:00] important one at this point is Bitcoin
[65:02] so therefore we need to be clear to say
[65:04] Bitcoin only only Bitcoin that's Bitcoin
[65:06] maximalism right but at the same time
[65:08] once you're more like you you understand
[65:11] the nuances like yourself I can be like
[65:13] hey look yeah Bitcoin is the first the
[65:16] most important but also this one this
[65:19] other coin also has value would I
[65:21] recommend you buy it only if you as an
[65:25] adult responsible adults have done your
[65:28] research understand why you need it and
[65:31] choose to use it but for a nocoiner I'd
[65:33] be like nah dude absolute trash don't
[65:36] look at it right so in a way I'm both
[65:39] placing the bar very high and very low
[65:41] for myself for what a Bitcoin Maxim list
[65:43] is because it depends on who you're
[65:45] talking to and you have to adjust the
[65:47] way that you talk to so yes I'm a
[65:49] Bitcoin maximalist but of course I'm a
[65:51] different level of Bitcoin maximalist
[65:53] depending on who I'm talking to you if
[65:54] I'm talking to you I would say perhaps
[65:56] some less of a Bitcoin maximalist
[65:58] because we can have a more nuanced
[66:00] interesting conversation but if I'm
[66:02] talking to a nocoiner hell no I'm super
[66:04] toxic like cat through I'll you say any
[66:08] other coin I'll be like pow get out of
[66:12] here I love that you also said one
[66:15] sentence that um is so clear on the
[66:18] bitcoiners but so unclear under um non
[66:22] bitcoiners it's like of course we will
[66:24] only have one
[66:26] wh why do you think this is like why do
[66:29] you think we will only have one money if
[66:31] we now have so many different currencies
[66:33] yeah it it depends on the time frame
[66:36] that you take I feel like for the next
[66:37] 50 to 60 years we will have some weird
[66:40] hybrid where the dollar will have the
[66:43] dollar milkshake Theory thing happen
[66:45] where only the dollar survives uh but
[66:47] then Bitcoin will be like either backing
[66:51] dollar and at the same time being an
[66:53] independent currency or just kind of
[66:55] like the dollar working as some in some
[66:58] way and the Bitcoin being used by
[66:59] example by the bricks Nations and every
[67:02] all of the neutral nations of the world
[67:03] that don't want to get [ __ ] over in a
[67:05] way similar to how um nowadays in
[67:08] Venezuela there's like multiple coins
[67:10] being used because people recognize
[67:12] different values for different things
[67:13] Bitcoin will be used as the savings
[67:15] account of of people of people but the
[67:19] dollar maybe used as like trading or
[67:21] whatever I don't know but I feel like
[67:22] short term it's not going to happen per
[67:24] se but longterm
[67:26] it's in it's inevitable why because all
[67:29] of these Fiat currencies they're in the
[67:31] hands of politicians and I'm going to
[67:33] tell you one thing that is always true
[67:36] politicians are not the best investors
[67:38] and when they [ __ ] up they're also not
[67:40] not the most humble people and instead
[67:42] of just accepting their errors and like
[67:44] paying the full price of it uh for
[67:46] example for a private company that would
[67:47] be like oh no we [ __ ] up let's go
[67:50] bankrupt there's no other way around it
[67:51] they're instead going to press the magic
[67:54] button where they can press a one and
[67:56] then lots of zeros behind it and
[67:58] suddenly poof their mistakes are gone
[68:00] what does that mean all of all of the
[68:02] field currencies they're on the same
[68:04] path it's just that the Venezuela and
[68:06] bivar and the mosom Beek currency and
[68:09] Zimbabwe dollar or whatever they just
[68:11] got their first but all of them they're
[68:13] going in the same direction it's just a
[68:15] matter of time so in 150 years 200 years
[68:18] only Bitcoin will will be there truly
[68:22] and then many other Cur countries will
[68:24] try to um in an authoritarian
[68:26] dictatorship way try to enclose their
[68:29] people oh no you only need to use this
[68:30] currency like it already happens
[68:32] nowadays but Bitcoin will be the de
[68:33] facto only money and that's why we
[68:38] Bitcoin also know it's it's the most
[68:40] conservative thing that you could uh
[68:43] possibly own right right now because
[68:45] like the general public is like oh like
[68:46] it's so risky it's so volatile no like
[68:49] it's the only thing that will
[68:51] conserve and preserve your financial
[68:54] energy over the next 200 years
[68:56] and if you want to do that like what
[68:58] else would you park your money in like
[69:00] companies like gold like is really
[69:04] hot yeah yeah I mean it's funny that you
[69:07] bring up gold now because we're starting
[69:08] to see how it's unraveling in the long
[69:11] Stock Exchange uh or gold exchange like
[69:14] interest rates are going super high
[69:16] eight weeks before you can get your gold
[69:19] deliver all of that so yeah and gold was
[69:22] the second best option to bitcoin right
[69:25] so
[69:26] anyway companies look block Blockbuster
[69:29] was the biggest company in like was one
[69:32] of the biggest companies in the 2000s
[69:33] right by 2010 it didn't exist Netflix
[69:36] nowadays is one of the biggest companies
[69:39] is it going to be here in the 2040s
[69:41] 2050s by the end of the
[69:44] century right that is the whole Michael
[69:46] sailor feel right of like oh Bitcoin is
[69:49] the only one that you can verifiably or
[69:51] like you have the once you study how
[69:54] they work it's highest confidence that
[69:56] it's going to be around for the next at
[69:58] least 150 to A Thousand Years what do
[70:01] you think is the they I mean some of
[70:03] them we already covered but what what do
[70:05] you think are the implications of
[70:07] Bitcoin being adopted in the world
[70:10] interesting you're your recording failed
[70:12] for some reason oh okay I cut
[70:16] right uh now now you see me again I see
[70:21] you again yeah did you also get that
[70:22] weird like oh not able to add more
[70:25] frames or
[70:26] something uh it said that um
[70:31] your let me is that your first like I've
[70:35] not seen a lot of podcasts from
[70:37] you um no it's not my first one I've
[70:40] done a few others with the cot fanol and
[70:43] Luke the wolf uh
[70:45] bitcoinity also yeah that that was very
[70:47] good especially for Bitcoin mining so if
[70:49] someone wants to hear about Bitcoin
[70:51] mining in depth perhaps you can Shield
[70:53] that like if someone is more interested
[70:54] in my thoughts Bitcoin mining that one
[70:56] would be the one and otherwise I did the
[70:59] one with Ian major recently that was
[71:01] more about like the demand pool and pool
[71:04] decentralization so that was very
[71:06] interesting um but yeah um want to ask
[71:08] the question again and we keep
[71:11] rolling uh I was just because of first
[71:15] for some reason I didn't find any but I
[71:16] was like oh like you're so good in
[71:17] speaking you you probably have been on
[71:19] on other podcasts yeah that's I think
[71:22] everything is is is set nicely uh
[71:26] should ask you the question again uh
[71:29] because what was the um what do you
[71:32] think look like with Bitcoin exactly
[71:34] what are the implications of of of
[71:37] Bitcoin being
[71:38] adopted I think it's going to be very
[71:40] interesting I'm going to answer it from
[71:42] an economics perspective because um I
[71:45] feel like the whole Paradigm is going to
[71:48] change in the sense that first of all it
[71:51] deflation is not going to be linear and
[71:53] perfect like deflation is going to be
[71:56] volatile let's say you take 10 years and
[71:59] over those 10 years there's going to be
[72:02] a total of 2 to 3% deflation per year
[72:05] more or less but some objects some
[72:08] Industries some materials will actually
[72:11] have gone up in price over that time and
[72:13] they may eventually come back down or
[72:15] they just stay up there for example oil
[72:17] at some point we're going to actually
[72:18] truly start running out of oil and at
[72:20] that point the price is just going to go
[72:22] up right there's no way around it um
[72:25] other things like TVs or or actually
[72:27] everything is actually going to start
[72:29] slowly going down in price um but it's
[72:34] not going to go all at the same time so
[72:37] what happens so what does that mean for
[72:38] the rest of the economy what we're going
[72:40] to see is that people are not going to
[72:42] get so many salary increases so like
[72:45] increasing your salary will once again
[72:47] matter it will actually mean something
[72:49] because every because there's this thing
[72:51] called sticky prices um where people
[72:54] like especially with wages that happens
[72:56] L with salaries people don't like their
[72:58] salary their number that they're paid to
[73:00] go down um and that was something that
[73:03] was learned at the same time that the
[73:06] economists in general learned about how
[73:08] bad inflation was and that was after the
[73:10] first world war when the UK government
[73:14] against the wishes and the
[73:16] recommendations of most economists
[73:18] started implementing a forced deflation
[73:21] to go back to the gold to pound ratio
[73:25] pre first world war and that's where
[73:27] they were literally like lowering the
[73:28] wages of everyone uh forcibly and then
[73:31] also lowering the um the prices of
[73:34] everything but of course it didn't all
[73:36] happen at the same time so that's where
[73:38] the whole thing of like oh deflation is
[73:40] bad most likely comes from and that H
[73:43] that and that was because it was a
[73:45] government mandated and coordinated
[73:47] thing but when it's coordinated by the
[73:48] free market and it's just the forces of
[73:51] the free market and Technology acting on
[73:54] products and services to make them
[73:56] cheaper over time what will happen is
[73:57] that people still don't like to hey this
[74:00] year you're getting paid 2% less like
[74:02] nobody likes that nobody wants that so
[74:04] what you're effectively getting is every
[74:06] year let's say you get paid 40K a year
[74:09] or let's put it in sets 100,000 SATs a
[74:12] year that could be a good salary or
[74:15] perhaps it's crazy in a 100 years like
[74:18] it's it's getting paid a million dollars
[74:20] now who knows but let's say 100,000 SATs
[74:23] that means that every year you will be k
[74:25] getting paid those 100,000 CS but you
[74:27] will also be able to purchase on average
[74:31] 2 to 3% more and after 10 years you will
[74:34] have effectively gotten a 20% increase
[74:36] in your salary right so what happen is
[74:40] your employer is not going to just have
[74:43] to keep up with inflation if anything
[74:45] they may even ask you to lower your
[74:47] salary every now and then but of course
[74:49] it's going to be contested like that's
[74:50] going to be balanced out with you don't
[74:53] like nobody wants to get paid less so
[74:55] the Stick of wages and you are going to
[74:58] be 10 years older you're going to have
[74:59] that much more knowledge so you will
[75:01] actually be uh like uh capable of
[75:05] getting a a small salary bump and it
[75:08] will be a meaningful one right because
[75:10] at that point it's not oh there was 10%
[75:12] inflation we're going to increase your
[75:14] salary by 8% oh thanks I only lost 2% of
[75:17] my of my salary right it's going to be
[75:19] like hey over the 10 last 10 years you
[75:21] were getting paid the same but every
[75:23] year you were able to buy more now we're
[75:25] going to actually give you even a better
[75:27] like you're actually going to be able to
[75:28] have more purchasing power not just
[75:30] because of free market but because
[75:32] you're providing more to a free market
[75:33] to the to the company and therefore
[75:35] we're going to be able to pay you and
[75:37] that's going to be super interesting
[75:39] because having or getting a salary
[75:41] increase will start to matter much more
[75:44] and people's like everything changes
[75:48] like the government doesn't need to care
[75:50] anymore about oh
[75:52] um that's we have to increase the
[75:55] minimum wage because otherwise people
[75:57] cannot live it will actually be the
[75:58] opposite like hey perhaps we should
[76:00] lower the minimum wage right because now
[76:03] someone working as a bank teller or like
[76:05] in the supermarket they're actually
[76:07] making twice as much as 20 years ago or
[76:10] 30 years ago right so that that's going
[76:12] to be very interesting it's going to I
[76:15] it's what everyone says right it's going
[76:16] to bring a world of abundance instead of
[76:18] having to have the red race you're out
[76:21] of it and not just out of it on the
[76:23] neutral it's actually working working in
[76:25] your favor so it's going to be a huge
[76:28] difference and yeah I already see that
[76:30] to some some extent because I now get
[76:32] paid in Bitcoin uh most of my income
[76:35] actually and uh you already feel the
[76:37] consequences a little bit where like
[76:39] okay like okay I I set my prices in
[76:41] Euros uh and I got that amount uh like
[76:46] eight months ago uh and now I'm only
[76:49] getting that amount
[76:51] yeah so so um it
[76:55] it's it's it's hard to keep up with with
[76:57] Bitcoin already even though like I'm I'm
[77:01] fast growing small company uh even
[77:04] though it's still still hard to keep up
[77:07] but honestly I feel that's way better to
[77:10] have a lower nominal uh uh number but a
[77:15] higher higher purchasing power with that
[77:18] versus having lower purchasing power but
[77:20] a higher normal number but people are
[77:22] not ready for that no but of course it's
[77:25] also not going to happen all at the same
[77:27] time and the changes I mean we were
[77:28] talking about this with um the the
[77:30] Meetup where we do our meetups it's this
[77:33] co-working and the guy always um sells
[77:36] beers and he has his own BDC pay server
[77:38] and all of that right and I was looking
[77:40] at one of the invoices recently and now
[77:43] that the price is at 100K that's very
[77:46] good cu the conversion is very simple2
[77:49] is like 2,000 sets um and I was looking
[77:52] at that and I was like dude do you
[77:54] remember remember like a year and a half
[77:56] ago this invoice instead of 2,000 SATs
[77:59] was like 7,000 STS it's like how does
[78:03] that feel first of all in a way you sold
[78:06] me a 7e beer but also at the same time
[78:09] now you're getting less SATs so but
[78:11] that's that's very extreme right that's
[78:12] a very extreme example but in the future
[78:14] it's going to be like products are
[78:16] always going to be a bit cheaper your
[78:20] salary is going to stay the same right
[78:22] you're going to get the same amount of
[78:23] ss 100,000 SATs
[78:25] um and unless you somehow become dumber
[78:28] and provide less value in 10 years um
[78:32] you will actually get a meaningful rise
[78:34] in your stats in your salary uh while
[78:37] the rest of the objects keep going down
[78:39] but of course if something happens like
[78:41] a plandemic or a or or a war and
[78:44] suddenly Supply chains are constrained
[78:47] there could actually be inflation for a
[78:48] short while but of course that inflation
[78:50] will be offset by actual faster
[78:53] deflation right it's going to be like a
[78:54] bump you first go up that's going to be
[78:57] very fast right oh no things are now
[78:59] cosing like it happened with olive oil
[79:00] here in Spain that that's the most
[79:02] Spanish thing ever like olive oil prices
[79:06] started to go up not because of money
[79:08] well for yeah they F they I I think a
[79:11] lader of olive oil used to ca like by
[79:13] the way good quality olive oil not like
[79:16] mixed with seed oils or whatever like
[79:18] pure the pure [ __ ] used to cost like €2
[79:21] and a half per liter um and it started
[79:23] going up with Co um to like I think it
[79:27] was like three and a half four EUR
[79:28] that's already pretty bad that's already
[79:29] 100% increase almost and then last year
[79:33] we had a drought and uh that was very
[79:36] bad for the oil for the olive production
[79:39] which also meant that it was a very bad
[79:41] production for olive oil and the prices
[79:43] went up to like 12 to 15 per liter and
[79:46] people were like oh my like in Spain we
[79:49] actually had a crisis because of oil
[79:51] olive oil like our oil crisis is
[79:53] different to the oil crisis in the US
[79:55] for them is gasoline for us is our olive
[79:58] oil right and the funny thing is
[80:00] recently my mom was commen like telling
[80:02] me hey but the way Kenobi you know that
[80:04] well she doesn't call me Kenobi but
[80:05] anyway you know that now allive oil
[80:07] prices are back down to like 5 four and
[80:10] a half and I was like that's a perfect
[80:12] example of how inflation or like Supply
[80:16] shocks or demand shocks will happen in
[80:18] the future in regards to price so let's
[80:21] say the the war in Ukraine right oh all
[80:24] the gas prices are going up all the oil
[80:26] prices are going all that what what a
[80:28] big problem now we paying more right we
[80:31] of course we bitcoiners we all know it's
[80:32] a lie but in the future what would
[80:34] happen is As on this like continual slow
[80:38] slope we would see a big increase and
[80:40] then it would just return back to normal
[80:42] after one year two years when the free
[80:43] market has managed to like go around the
[80:46] problem so to speak right um or
[80:49] conditions change cuz in this case what
[80:51] happened is this year we had a good like
[80:53] like a lot of rain
[80:55] and therefore the oil um uh like the
[80:59] olive production was good and therefore
[81:00] the oil production was also good Supply
[81:03] comes back up the price comes back down
[81:05] and we're back at 5 Euros but but of
[81:08] course people are not ready for that and
[81:10] people think that what that happened
[81:11] that's actually deflation what all the
[81:13] economists say oh it's so bad it's so
[81:15] bad but in reality that's a good
[81:17] deflation and anyway that's that's the
[81:19] whole thing so I think that's what's
[81:20] going to happen in the future like
[81:22] that's going to happen with all of the
[81:23] products they're going to slowly go down
[81:26] some will actually have some increases
[81:27] some will go down faster some will
[81:29] actually not move or get more expensive
[81:31] but on average all of them 2% down yeah
[81:35] and it's interesting with with the
[81:37] salary um of like maybe we even get to
[81:40] the point where companies because
[81:43] there's a a lot of price pressure uh and
[81:47] competition actually have to have a hard
[81:50] conversation with the employee and
[81:52] saying like oh like we have to lower
[81:53] your
[81:55] um salary from like 100,000 to 90,000
[81:57] but those 90,000 like 90 might be 10% is
[82:01] probably too too much or like we have to
[82:03] lower it like 5% uh but those those
[82:07] 95,000 sets will probably buy you more
[82:10] than the 100,000 STS in the in the
[82:12] previous year exactly and actually 10%
[82:15] may not even be too crazy I remember
[82:17] someone did an analysis some crazy
[82:20] person had been um doing a perfect
[82:24] accounting of everything they bought
[82:26] like groceries for the past like 15
[82:28] years on an Excel spreadsheet and they
[82:31] published the results in like 20121 more
[82:33] or less
[82:34] 2022 and um something that they noted is
[82:37] that for example with food prices they
[82:39] only increase every five years five to
[82:41] six years so what they do is in a way if
[82:44] if that's how the inflation is going
[82:46] they will for a while go under but then
[82:48] when they decide to change the price
[82:50] they go up above and they take right and
[82:53] so for a while they are actually
[82:54] outrunning inflation but then inflation
[82:57] catches back up and then they're back
[82:58] underwater so they don't change the
[83:00] prices all the time that's also
[83:02] something that's going to be very very
[83:03] interesting that people don't realize
[83:05] everyone's always like Bitcoin is so
[83:06] volatile what what's how are we going to
[83:09] be protected what if like what if we
[83:11] cannot manage the money then
[83:12] everything's going to be volatile and
[83:13] whatnot and people don't realize that
[83:15] companies already take care of that like
[83:17] this smoothing out of like Hey we're
[83:19] only going to change the price of milk
[83:21] every 5 to six years to adjust inflation
[83:24] is companies protecting consumers from
[83:27] volatility when Apple started to make
[83:29] the titani the titanium on their iPhones
[83:32] like their titanium iPhones the iPhone
[83:33] Pros or whatever um like I think it was
[83:36] like five months later the price of
[83:38] titanium increased by like 300% or
[83:40] something like that the prices of
[83:42] iPhones didn't go up it's just that
[83:43] companies take care of like absorbing
[83:45] that volatility so the like it's not
[83:48] that like cuz people say oh with Bitcoin
[83:50] how like the Bitcoin is so volatile like
[83:53] how are we going to be able to price
[83:54] price anything on the on the market like
[83:56] on the grocery store or anywhere it's
[83:59] like guys it's not going to be like
[84:01] there's going to be like a life chart of
[84:03] the price of pears and apples and
[84:05] bananas like no because there's
[84:07] companies in between that they manage
[84:09] this volatility for the end
[84:12] consumer but but it would would be fun
[84:14] if like there's like all a price live
[84:17] price chat off like cherries and bananas
[84:19] and like oh like oh like it's gone down
[84:23] 0.3%
[84:24] today I don't know if it will be too fun
[84:26] because I think it was um something like
[84:29] Walmart or
[84:30] Sears one of the analysts um spoke about
[84:33] one of their new inventions and it's
[84:35] those digital instead of price tags
[84:37] digital price taags and it was saying
[84:38] that oh in a hot summer day the price of
[84:41] water could go up by 150% or it starts
[84:45] raining and umbrellas could be priced at
[84:47] three times the price right so perhaps
[84:50] we don't want the perfect free market
[84:53] with perfect Market to market prices on
[84:56] everything all the time you know what I
[84:57] mean it's like that's a bit instead of
[84:59] Cipher Punk it's a bit cyber Punk and
[85:02] that's not so fun but it but it's
[85:04] interesting how for example on on a gas
[85:06] station it's normal like on a gas
[85:08] station you always like see the see the
[85:09] big big price of like oh like that
[85:11] that's how how much you you pay um but
[85:14] but uh for for almost everything else um
[85:18] that consumers uh buy like it's it's
[85:21] like a fixed one that's interesting
[85:23] you're you're right yeah yeah that I
[85:25] guess it's because gas is a more
[85:27] commodity but also apples are also a
[85:30] commodity right and corn and and
[85:33] potatoes that's that's a nice Rabbit
[85:35] Hole I'll have to dig deep on that one
[85:37] see see what I come up with then let's
[85:40] Circle back in like six months and see
[85:42] what you found exactly in the second
[85:45] round of the broadcast
[85:48] yeah yeah really really cool I enjoyed
[85:50] it a lot um our podcast already we
[85:54] overtime I hope you have don't have an
[85:56] appointment directly next to it um but I
[85:59] asked one uh question that I asked each
[86:02] and every one of my guests and this is
[86:03] the question of what can we learn from
[86:05] you besides
[86:06] Bitcoin from me well Bitcoin
[86:11] mining you cannot learn about Bitcoin
[86:14] but you can learn about Bitcoin Min yeah
[86:16] I think um I think Bitcoin mining is the
[86:19] main thing that because in a way it's
[86:22] also different from Bitcoin because man
[86:24] Bitcoin mining is its own rabbit hole
[86:26] but otherwise apart from that I guess
[86:28] Star Wars I mean we have the the R2-D2 I
[86:32] don't know if it's on camera up here
[86:34] somewhere um but yeah I'm big fan of
[86:37] Star Wars and otherwise right now I'm
[86:39] blanking I can't economics uh like I
[86:42] guess economics will be the one like
[86:43] I've been trying to like I don't have
[86:46] enough time but like I've been trying to
[86:48] go down the austan economics Rabbit Hole
[86:51] now that I'm out of college and I don't
[86:52] have all of that Fiat to learn um I've
[86:56] been trying to start going down the
[86:57] rabbit hole start to read all L the
[86:59] classics and then also get further down
[87:02] the behavioral economics Rabbit Hole I
[87:05] know that people like safety namus and
[87:06] whatnot they just outright handwave it
[87:09] away like oh it doesn't matter but I
[87:11] feel like there's something there
[87:12] there's something there I I just need to
[87:14] go down that path explore it a bit more
[87:17] so I think that would be the thing like
[87:18] economics I love talking economics um
[87:21] thinking about how things would be why
[87:23] yes why not like all of that so I think
[87:26] economics Bitcoin mining and economics
[87:29] let's put it that way I love that yeah
[87:32] and that's that behavioral economics is
[87:34] really interesting I I I like that a lot
[87:37] if like like how how how you price
[87:40] things how you present things uh makes
[87:42] such a huge difference uh but yeah like
[87:45] that that that's great um we have end
[87:47] routine in the podcast where the
[87:48] previous guest is asking a question for
[87:50] the next guest without knowing who the
[87:51] next guest actually is uh and the
[87:53] question
[87:55] uh for you is what is the most deeply
[87:57] and meaningful thing about Bitcoin uh
[88:01] that anyone can cont uh can contribute
[88:04] to
[88:05] bitcoin oo so how can you maximize your
[88:09] impact towards Bitcoin right
[88:14] yeah not making it easy the most not
[88:19] Bitcoin mining there's already enough of
[88:20] that um and if you do be sure to like
[88:25] contact us at theand pool you know
[88:26] stratum V2 all of that decentralized
[88:29] Bitcoin mining y bit AIS bit AIS that's
[88:31] a good one I think perhaps mining is the
[88:33] one yeah bit AIS but at the same time
[88:35] it's a small impact and perhaps you can
[88:37] do more impact by just like orange ping
[88:41] people I'm torn apart between Bida so
[88:45] like joining the bidx
[88:47] movement
[88:48] and just orange pilling like in the
[88:51] sense of like not just like a hitting
[88:54] people with Bitcoin because that's what
[88:56] many people do they just oh they just
[88:58] scream Bitcoin at people's faces but
[89:00] more like sitting down having the
[89:02] patients to to explain
[89:05] it but if I had to choose one of them I
[89:08] would say the bidx movement I would say
[89:11] the bid ax movement so like joining bidx
[89:13] because just by doing that if you have
[89:16] it at your house the moment someone
[89:17] comes over you can show it to them and
[89:19] that opens up the conversation and
[89:21] you're already orange pilling while also
[89:23] my
[89:24] Bitcoin securing the network and hey who
[89:28] knows getting a block so I think bidx
[89:31] would be the one yeah bit X Ah that's
[89:33] that's really cool uh amazing perfect
[89:36] then uh uh the only last thing that
[89:39] comes to my mind is like where can
[89:40] people find you where can people ask
[89:41] your questions and reach out to you yeah
[89:44] so um I'm one of the organizers of the
[89:47] Bitcoin meet up in Barcelona uh Bitcoin
[89:50] Barcelona Bitcoin only so if you come
[89:53] through Barcelona feel free to join the
[89:54] telegram group otherwise you can find me
[89:57] at Twitter in Twitter at Kenobi General
[90:01] 5 um and then also Noster Kenobi uh and
[90:06] otherwise I would quickly shill but I
[90:08] already did uh the company I'm working
[90:10] for stratum V2 demand pool is the first
[90:13] company this the first pool
[90:15] decentralizing Bitcoin mining with
[90:17] stratom V2 so the pling free open source
[90:20] software to like secure Bitcoin for all
[90:22] of us so that's pretty dope so follow us
[90:24] there we're de Demand poool on Twitter
[90:29] and we also have a website dmnd
[90:33] d.org so without the vowels um and I
[90:36] think that's it really cool I love that
[90:39] you I think you mentioned at least bitco
[90:41] me up like at least like four times in
[90:43] in in the conversation so it seems like
[90:45] it's a something very important for you
[90:47] and I think that's that that speaks uh
[90:50] to to you love like it it's important to
[90:52] that Bitcoin as me in person with each
[90:55] other I think that's a it's a really
[90:57] great thing to do that could also be a
[91:00] great answer for the question that you
[91:02] post me before going to a Bitcoin Meet
[91:04] app and also even more important going
[91:06] to a conference I feel like going to a
[91:08] conference if you're a bitcoiner and you
[91:10] have never been to conference you're
[91:12] missing are you going to uh in in Europe
[91:16] the biggest next one is probably Bitcoin
[91:18] prag are you going there yeah I'm gonna
[91:20] be there everyone should be there I
[91:22] really cool I love that yeah like
[91:25] actually I don't want to make too much
[91:28] advertisement but it's actually one of
[91:31] my official Partners uh yeah Bitcoin PR
[91:34] is such an amazing thing because like in
[91:36] the starting when I was just getting
[91:39] started in Bitcoin I was going to
[91:41] bitcoin par I was like ah let's let's go
[91:42] there let's see it's close to to my my
[91:45] hometown it was not that far away I was
[91:47] and I was getting that energy of like I
[91:49] want to do more and that was basically
[91:52] like the starting in condition that I
[91:54] needed to start the whole thing that I'm
[91:57] now doing with the podcast so like
[91:58] Bitcoin progress I think going to a
[92:01] conference and also meetups like if you
[92:03] cannot afford to like or like you don't
[92:05] want to invest in money to move around
[92:08] the planet and go somewhere you can just
[92:11] go to a local Meetup that's not as good
[92:13] as a conference but it it does also a
[92:16] really good job in in doing the the the
[92:20] the things like it's it's it's perfectly
[92:21] fine but if you have the means to go to
[92:24] a conference like you you you basically
[92:26] have to go there and then experience the
[92:29] the the thing there uh and yeah Bitcoin
[92:32] brag is is a huge recommendation of of
[92:34] mine Bitcoin prag there's now also
[92:37] Bitcoin Helsinki we're going to have a
[92:38] Bitcoin conference in Barcelona but
[92:40] that's one it's a bit more private in
[92:42] Spain we also have uh watch out Bitcoin
[92:45] France has Bitcoin bits uh there's
[92:49] uh in in in the UK they have Bitcoin the
[92:52] cheat cheat code by Peter mccormac uh
[92:55] Germany has also the Citadel uh like any
[93:00] of these or bit Baltic Badger the
[93:03] original European conference any of
[93:05] these they're just incredible and you
[93:08] should go at least to one of them at
[93:10] least afterwards you will go to the
[93:11] others because just makes sense like
[93:14] you'll the value is so present and the
[93:17] rest makes sense but that's why I'm
[93:19] saying go at least to one the rest
[93:21] follows by itself absolutely and if you
[93:23] go to someone uh at some conference use
[93:26] code
[93:28] Robin and uh perfect and thank you so
[93:31] much uh Kenobi for for being on the show
[93:33] you have been an amazing guest thank you
