[00:00] it's very difficult for me to believe
[00:01] that Bitcoin doesn't become the standard
[00:03] deao money in the next 10 years if it's
[00:04] come this far into the first 15 it's how
[00:07] government currencies typically
[00:08] hyperinflate and it's also how people
[00:10] come to understand Bitcoin gradually
[00:12] then suddenly Fiat currencies are
[00:14] failing on their own weight in dependent
[00:16] of Bitcoin such that if Bitcoin didn't
[00:18] exist the Fiat currencies are still
[00:21] failing and would still fail when it
[00:22] reaches an equilibrium where it's larger
[00:24] than the US dollar the trajectory to get
[00:26] there and all the knowledge that would
[00:27] have to have distributed causes people
[00:29] to rap look around the world and say
[00:31] enough people have come to this
[00:32] conclusion that Bitcoin is money and
[00:34] everyone rushes in they don't have to
[00:35] read a book to understand it it's like
[00:37] picking up the telephone the telephone
[00:38] works I need a form of money that works
[00:40] and this one does my incentive is to
[00:42] adopt I can't predict the timing of when
[00:45] Saudi Arabia is going to start selling
[00:47] oil for Bitcoin I just know that they're
[00:49] going to do it and why if 80 million
[00:52] people have come to the conclusion that
[00:53] Bitcoin is money it becomes harder for
[00:55] the other 7.9 billion people to say no
[00:59] somebody needs to understand why Bitcoin
[01:01] stores value before they're willing to
[01:04] accept it directly as payment what if
[01:05] there's a thousand Merchants you know
[01:07] what if Apple says you can sell your
[01:09] Bitcoin to me the more people that are
[01:11] competing for exchange of your Bitcoin
[01:13] the more valuable your Bitcoin is
[01:15] [Music]
[01:19] becoming you coined or like popularized
[01:22] the the the saying gradually then
[01:24] suddenly I think on on only on this
[01:27] podcast probably like 50 times your name
[01:30] or grad and suddenly already fell uh so
[01:35] what do you mean by by that and how did
[01:38] it come for you to to that uh phrase
[01:41] yeah so I would say maybe I um
[01:44] popularized it within the Bitcoin
[01:46] community and um in the series that I
[01:50] wrote which I started in
[01:51] 2019 and then I turned it into a book
[01:55] late last year in
[01:56] 2023 um I explained that uh so gradually
[02:00] then suddenly is an adaptation of how
[02:04] Ernest Hemingway described the process
[02:07] of going bankrupt in one of his novels
[02:10] The Sun Also Rises and in the in the
[02:13] actual novel it's a discussion between
[02:16] two characters where one character asks
[02:18] another character how did you go
[02:21] bankrupt and the and the response was
[02:22] two ways um gradually and then suddenly
[02:27] um and so the way that I back when I
[02:31] started writing about
[02:32] Bitcoin the way I think about it related
[02:35] to bitcoin specifically is that or
[02:38] connecting those dots is it was how
[02:40] Hemingway described the process of going
[02:42] bankrupt it's how government currencies
[02:45] or Fiat currencies typically
[02:47] hyperinflate and it's also how people
[02:49] come to understand Bitcoin gradually
[02:51] then suddenly that it's accumulating
[02:55] generally it's accumulating knowledge
[02:58] over a period of time listening to a
[03:00] podcast reading a book having Bitcoin
[03:03] explained to you and it not quite making
[03:06] sense but it kind of slowly getting
[03:10] there and then generally that knowledge
[03:12] base has to be connected with some real
[03:14] world experience some lived experience
[03:16] where then there's a a something that
[03:19] clicks and when it clicks that's at
[03:22] least opening up the possibility in
[03:24] someone's individual's mind of
[03:28] understanding Bitcoin and then from
[03:30] there it becomes very intuitive over
[03:31] time so there there's kind of the
[03:33] gradual then suddenly adoption of
[03:35] Bitcoin both on an individual level and
[03:37] then also on a global level and I so I
[03:39] think that there's a sudden moment where
[03:41] Bitcoin starts to click for someone it
[03:43] doesn't it's not at that point 100%
[03:46] intuitive but from that point it becomes
[03:49] that and then also there will be a time
[03:52] where bitcoin's monetization is very
[03:55] rapid and so there's always the question
[03:57] of like are we in the suddenly moment
[03:58] now and it's I like to answer that
[04:01] question by simply saying that when
[04:04] we're at that suddenly moment it will
[04:06] become very obvious so it's so like uh
[04:10] you know we're not in suddenly because
[04:11] we're still asking a question if we're
[04:13] in suly that's a great way to put it uh
[04:16] interesting um this gradually and
[04:19] suddenly moment you can look in my
[04:21] perspective two ways the first way is
[04:23] like the the fall of fear as you
[04:26] describe with the the the the depth uh
[04:29] with that man or the the rise and the
[04:31] adoption of of of Bitcoin uh what would
[04:34] be the the more accurate way or are they
[04:36] so interconnected that like one goes
[04:39] with another well I think they are very
[04:40] connected and so you know another kind
[04:43] of idea that I would throw out there to
[04:45] to to articulate this is Jeff Bezos has
[04:49] a famous quote or comment where he
[04:51] talked like it was I think it was on a
[04:53] an earnings call where he's talking
[04:54] about how whatever he was
[04:57] doing that quarter was determined in
[04:59] three years in the past that if if they
[05:03] were if Amazon was going to be returning
[05:05] a certain you know amount of Revenue or
[05:07] income you know as he's given guidance
[05:09] there's nothing that he could do about
[05:10] it in the present so when I think about
[05:12] Fiat currencies if you think about that
[05:15] being true for an individual company of
[05:17] how far back the decision that you make
[05:20] impact in the present that what we're
[05:22] seeing play out in Fiat currencies today
[05:27] is something that is at least going back
[05:30] a decade if not decades in the making
[05:33] basically that you know I you know will
[05:36] point to the severance of Fiat
[05:40] currencies from any commodity metal like
[05:43] gold that that that was when fiat
[05:45] currency is detached from any modum of
[05:49] reality and so we're we're kind of 50
[05:52] years out from the money that everybody
[05:56] uses dayto day really not being anchored
[05:58] to the physical world in any way and
[06:01] that Bitcoin is a return to that and so
[06:03] when I think about the dichotomy or the
[06:06] relationship between the failures of
[06:08] Fiat currencies and and and the rise of
[06:12] Bitcoin Fiat currencies are
[06:15] failing for that reason that they are
[06:19] not connected to the physical world in
[06:22] any way and that they can be because
[06:24] they became detached from any physical
[06:26] reality they can be printed without cost
[06:29] they could be created out of thin air so
[06:32] I like to think that the Fiat currencies
[06:34] are failing on their own weight
[06:36] independent of Bitcoin such that if
[06:39] Bitcoin didn't exist the Fiat currencies
[06:43] would still are still failing and would
[06:46] still fail completely just as Fiat
[06:48] currencies have now somebody Satoshi
[06:52] Nakamoto recognized that it was a
[06:55] problem and set off to create a solution
[06:58] similar to if there's a problem that
[07:00] exists in the world whatever that might
[07:01] be you need some solution to to fix it
[07:06] Bitcoin is that solution and that as it
[07:10] becomes more obvious that Fiat
[07:12] currencies are failing failing to store
[07:14] purchasing power failing to coordinate
[07:16] trade and here's this thing Bitcoin
[07:19] that's serving as a solution more people
[07:21] adopt it and the consequence is that
[07:24] they are related that when a fiat
[07:26] currency hyper inflates it will it will
[07:29] not be because Bitcoin exists but people
[07:32] will flee to the alternative that is
[07:35] Bitcoin at that moment where that
[07:37] becomes more and more obvious in more
[07:39] rapid fashion and Bitcoin monetizes more
[07:42] rapidly as a result of that is now
[07:45] feared failing faster because there is a
[07:49] solution to the problem people can
[07:50] actually opt out potentially yeah I mean
[07:54] I think that I guess you could think
[07:56] about it as if Bitcoin didn't
[07:58] exist there wouldn't be a
[08:01] lifebo and so everybody would still be
[08:04] more
[08:05] captive to the Legacy system that is
[08:09] failing it so potentially maybe it would
[08:12] fail slower but now that you do have
[08:15] this Outlet you do have this release
[08:17] valve which is I no longer have to opt
[08:19] into the failing form of money it could
[08:23] uh accelerate that forward which I think
[08:26] in the end will ultimately be a positive
[08:28] I I I have this Con an internal struggle
[08:30] which is the further off that Bitcoin
[08:33] can rapidly monetize maybe the more
[08:35] people that have gotten on the Lifeboat
[08:37] or more infrastructure the more prepared
[08:39] it is ultimately we're not in control of
[08:42] that what we what I at least believe to
[08:45] be certain is that the Fiat currencies
[08:48] are failing such that if we don't have
[08:49] this solution then everyone would be far
[08:52] worse off and so um but you know if you
[08:58] think about an anal ology of if
[09:00] somebody's on heroin and they need to go
[09:03] through withdrawal the longer you put
[09:05] that
[09:06] off the worse that person's and and and
[09:09] the uh the lesser the chance that person
[09:11] has of survival so it might be actually
[09:13] better that we accelerate the the
[09:16] failure forward only for the reason that
[09:18] we actually have a solution in hand to
[09:20] be able to offer to anybody who wants it
[09:25] to be a Lifeboat yeah there are a lot of
[09:27] examples of like that you don't want to
[09:29] have the Titanic sinking too fast so
[09:31] people have the time to build out the
[09:33] infrastructure the lifeboard and stuff
[09:35] like that uh which is really interesting
[09:37] I mean when you look at the whole
[09:38] history of Bitcoin it's it's kind of
[09:40] suddenly like 15 years and we're now at
[09:43] the stage where we are with Naas State
[09:44] and president talking about it that's
[09:46] already uh quite interesting I also want
[09:49] to highlight um uh exponential growth a
[09:52] little bit um I always uh I I got
[09:55] recently to know about the the the
[09:58] football stadium filling with water
[10:00] example uh where the football stadium is
[10:02] filling with water first minute one drop
[10:04] second minute two drops then four and so
[10:06] on like exponential growth and after 45
[10:10] minutes it's it's ran up to 7% the water
[10:13] and just five more minutes than it hits
[10:16] 100% uh I think it's I think it's hard
[10:19] to understand for people this
[10:21] exponential growth this this suddenly
[10:24] phas how this actually looks like uh how
[10:27] do you make uh how do make make it clear
[10:29] that the how how fast this suddenly goes
[10:32] and how how how powerful this this phase
[10:36] of all of the sudden it goes that
[10:38] suddenly and what what will happen in in
[10:41] that phase uh and also how how do you um
[10:44] maybe mention that in in in the book
[10:47] well I describe it so I'll describe it
[10:49] on the Fiat side and then I'll describe
[10:50] it on the on the Bitcoin side which is
[10:52] if if you look at Fiat currencies that
[10:56] have hyperinflated in recent past say
[11:00] the Venezuelan Boulevard or the Lebanese
[11:04] pound the Turkish L you hyper inflating
[11:08] to varying degrees there are moments
[11:11] when measured against the dollar where
[11:13] it becomes obvious that confidence was
[11:17] lost if you look at it if you look at it
[11:19] on the chart not from a technical
[11:21] analysis perspective but just where you
[11:23] can see the currency actually
[11:25] break and the point is that it didn't
[11:29] break at that moment it broke over time
[11:33] and in the past and then there was a
[11:35] moment when a critical mass of people
[11:37] all figured it out at once and eject it
[11:40] and then it never recovers it might
[11:42] strengthen slightly but it's a one-way
[11:45] path to
[11:47] zero where what It ultimately means is
[11:49] the currency no longer purchases
[11:51] anything and it can't cordinate trade
[11:55] same thing applies to bitcoin on the
[11:57] reverse side which is INF structure is
[11:59] being built the infrastructure is
[12:01] working Bitcoin is credibly enforcing
[12:03] its fixed Supply right now that is what
[12:06] it needs to do to be adopted globally as
[12:08] money and certainly the Bitcoin Network
[12:10] needs to improve more infrastructure
[12:12] needs to be built but that one operation
[12:14] it need do nothing different into the
[12:17] future in order to dictate that all the
[12:21] infrastructure will be built other than
[12:23] that one incentive and that if that one
[12:25] incentive holds as it does today then
[12:29] virtually the entire world will adopt
[12:30] Bitcoin as money that already exists now
[12:33] we're in the process of people figuring
[12:34] it out one by one by one picking up a
[12:37] book listening to a
[12:39] podcast
[12:41] and it doesn't have to be like I like to
[12:44] think about it is probably there's no no
[12:47] more than one out of a hundred people
[12:49] understand Bitcoin in any real way
[12:53] there's no good way to measure that
[12:55] other than walk around town and you know
[12:58] pull
[12:59] your company the people that you work
[13:01] with your friend circles your family
[13:03] circles and determine what you think the
[13:07] general population's understanding is is
[13:09] it one out of 100 is it two out of 100
[13:11] it doesn't need to be 50 out of 100 to
[13:13] cause Mass conversion uh or convergence
[13:17] onto Bitcoin it probably is something
[13:20] between one out of 20 and one out of 10
[13:24] because the people who have the greatest
[13:27] access to information and the greatest
[13:30] wealth to store will almost necessarily
[13:34] be on the front end of the adoption
[13:36] curve and so um we're still in a world
[13:40] where very few people under we're
[13:41] clearly not at a point where it's become
[13:44] obvious to one out of a 100 people let
[13:47] alone one out of one out of 20 people
[13:50] you can you can turn on your you know
[13:54] CNBC or read the financial times and you
[13:57] see someone that's otherwise well
[13:59] respected in the business World Trump
[14:02] just appointed a guy who was the head of
[14:06] soros's family office or investment fund
[14:10] and just by him speaking about crypto
[14:13] it's clear that he doesn't understand
[14:14] Bitcoin so a guy that that that is that
[14:15] sophisticated so it's very clear that
[14:17] we're not yet at that point but when it
[14:21] becomes clear to a critical mass when it
[14:24] becomes clear to one out of 20 people it
[14:27] becomes hard to deny that reality and
[14:29] then the other 19 out of
[14:32] 20 adopt Bitcoin not because they're
[14:35] sitting there reading a book and
[14:37] determining whether or not Bitcoin is
[14:39] money it's because they have to demand
[14:41] it they have to use it because it's the
[14:43] only currency working because enough
[14:46] people went before them and consciously
[14:49] evaluated and consciously determined
[14:51] that Bitcoin is the better form of money
[14:53] and then the herd gets dragged along
[14:55] essentially is how I think about it so
[14:57] that suddenly moment is then triggered
[15:00] by a simple big mass of people are being
[15:04] intolerant about Bitcoin and being
[15:06] really vocal and being really informed
[15:09] about that around four five six% uh of
[15:12] the population and that's kind of then
[15:15] triggering that that suddenly moment
[15:17] yeah because I'm also thinking that yeah
[15:20] that's that's the way I would that's a
[15:22] great way to articulate it and that if
[15:24] it's you know two three four 5% of the
[15:27] population but it's
[15:29] 10 20 30% of the
[15:31] wealth
[15:33] and um in just in terms of naturally
[15:37] where the incentives dictate who has
[15:39] wealth to store who has access to
[15:40] information who's evaluating
[15:43] this then if 10 to 20% of the wealth has
[15:47] figured this out that is when it becomes
[15:50] more obvious to more PE people also if
[15:53] you think about Bitcoin at equilibrium
[15:56] right now you know adjusting somewhat
[15:59] for this latest runup but where it was
[16:01] at 60,000 to where it is today somewhere
[16:04] between 1 to two trillion saying a
[16:07] midpoint of one and a half trillion or
[16:08] one and a half to 1.75
[16:10] trillion if Bitcoin adoption increased
[16:14] by a 100
[16:16] times then Bitcoin is the largest
[16:20] currency in the world so
[16:23] when Bitcoin starts to become rivaled to
[16:26] the US dollar in size which depending on
[16:30] how you measure it is somewhere between
[16:31] 8 trillion of Base money and 24 25
[16:36] trillion of broad money that when it
[16:38] reaches an equilibrium where it's larger
[16:40] than the US dollar or comparable in size
[16:44] the trajectory to get there and all the
[16:46] knowledge that would have to have been
[16:48] distributed causes people to rapidly
[16:50] look around the world and say enough
[16:51] people have come to this conclusion that
[16:53] Bitcoin is money and it's appreciating
[16:57] so fast and then the other side of that
[16:59] is the fiat currency is not just
[17:01] appreciating against Bitcoin but
[17:03] importantly against Real goods and
[17:05] services everyone rushes in they they
[17:08] they they recognize it becomes becomes
[17:10] easier to understand Bitcoin they don't
[17:12] have to read a book to understand it
[17:14] it's like picking up the telephone the
[17:16] telephone works I need a form of money
[17:18] that works and this one does my
[17:21] incentive is to adopt absolutely it will
[17:24] be it will be a no PR at some point even
[17:26] though if people don't understand it is
[17:28] it a surprising that at that early stage
[17:31] um such a gigantic Machinery like black
[17:35] rock is all of the sudden really
[17:37] positive and and really for Bitcoin then
[17:40] also USA which surprised me a lot but
[17:43] I'm also not in the USA that they are at
[17:46] least playing with that idea uh let's
[17:49] see if the bill actually passes and they
[17:51] are buying Bitcoin maybe uh even like
[17:53] big companies like Tesla um have some
[17:56] even though it's a very small amount of
[17:58] of the bance sheet is that surprising
[18:00] that those really huge institutions and
[18:02] companies already embrace it well I'd
[18:05] say that it's hard to
[18:08] predict the timing of any of
[18:11] these kind of Overton window
[18:15] shifting events right if we went back to
[18:18] 2021 and El Salvador decides to make
[18:22] Bitcoin legal tender now not many people
[18:26] in the
[18:27] world previous l or prior to that paid
[18:30] attention to El Salvador that's a
[18:32] country of Central America with 6
[18:35] million people that prior you know prior
[18:37] to that point for for most people
[18:39] living the thing that El Salvador had
[18:42] been most known for was being the murder
[18:45] capital of world and S Salvador and the
[18:48] place that 13 gang the MS 13 gang came
[18:51] from a country determined to decided to
[18:55] make Bitcoin legal tender fast forward
[18:59] three years Black Rock does an ETF the
[19:03] US is talking about strategic reserve
[19:05] the way that I think about that is that
[19:08] all of these events while difficult to
[19:11] predict the timing of are
[19:14] inevitable based on the fundamentals of
[19:17] Bitcoin and again its operation of being
[19:19] able to credibly enforce its fixed
[19:22] Supply without the need for trust that
[19:24] you can't predict the timing of the next
[19:26] shoe to drop like you can't we can I
[19:29] can't predict the timing of when Saudi
[19:32] Arabia is going to start selling oil for
[19:34] Bitcoin I just know that they're going
[19:37] to do it and why from a fundamental
[19:40] perspective and it might not be them
[19:42] first it might be Venezuela first or it
[19:44] might be katar first or it might be Iran
[19:46] first or it might be Russia first it's
[19:48] just that there's a finitely scarce form
[19:51] of money and it's hard to get oil out of
[19:53] the ground and every other currency in
[19:56] the world has counterparty risk Bitcoin
[19:58] doesn't
[19:59] so I think that the short answer to that
[20:01] question is I think if anybody went back
[20:04] 15 years and said hey Bitcoin is
[20:06] supposed to be
[20:07] this decentralized form of money that
[20:12] removes the need for trust and within
[20:14] the first 15 years of its development
[20:17] Black Rock will have launched an ETF and
[20:20] the US government would be even talking
[20:22] about a strategic Reserve you'd have to
[20:24] certainly say that's crazy like there's
[20:26] no way that in that time frame it will
[20:28] have AOL that that fast so I think that
[20:32] that's just the reality but it also was
[20:34] inevitable at the same time and more
[20:36] countries will follow and more Earth
[20:41] shattering decisions as it relates to
[20:44] people adopting Bitcoin or Neville which
[20:47] can't predict when or who but we know
[20:49] they'll happen for fundamental reasons
[20:51] absolutely uh that that seems to be um
[20:56] this super interesting for me the timing
[20:57] also of that it's it's super interesting
[21:00] for me also that retail is kind of
[21:01] sleeping now still didn't like I feel
[21:05] like a lot of companies uh are coming
[21:07] into Bitcoin and big institutions um and
[21:10] obviously the Bitcoin Community is
[21:12] making a lot of noise um but I see
[21:16] retail still sleeping and there's
[21:19] there's not a lot of of things going on
[21:21] even though as now I usually uh publish
[21:25] the podcast one two weeks after that so
[21:26] now we are uh still under 100K maybe if
[21:29] we publishing that we already over that
[21:32] so it's it's it's interesting how how
[21:34] retail is sleeping uh and uh we kind of
[21:38] at this massive inflection point where
[21:40] Bitcoin is so obvious if you actually
[21:42] educate yourself um it's it's it's
[21:45] really interesting how we look at the
[21:46] next adoption phase how do you think we
[21:49] we get to those next levels of of
[21:52] adoption where we're now at like maybe
[21:54] one one person out of 100 actually
[21:56] understands it how do we come to this 5%
[21:59] to 10% adoption well I think there you
[22:01] know one comment I would just make is
[22:03] that it's difficult to I'd say pattern
[22:07] match which
[22:10] is I don't know necessarily that you
[22:12] know if you if you look up prior to
[22:15] 20124 it was almost all retail very
[22:18] little institutions you know now
[22:21] obviously institutions have a lot more
[22:23] money when it comes to individual
[22:25] institutions or if we're talking about
[22:28] large public
[22:29] companies so it can move the needle more
[22:32] but I think it will you know at some
[22:34] point somebody will go back and and
[22:36] study the psychology of the individuals
[22:40] who came to understand Bitcoin versus
[22:42] the individuals that
[22:45] were late to the party and I I even
[22:48] hesitate to say that because everyone
[22:50] always feels late and we're still so
[22:52] early so anybody that's listening to
[22:54] this this is you know you are you are in
[22:57] the first 1% in my in my view so so that
[23:00] is the definition of early but there's
[23:02] certain billionaires that understand
[23:05] Bitcoin and there's certain billionaires
[23:07] that don't
[23:09] there's bluecollar workers who
[23:12] understand it and there's blueco collar
[23:13] workers who don't there's quote trafy
[23:16] people who understand it and and they
[23:19] don't I don't know there there when the
[23:22] dust settles there's probably some
[23:24] mapping where you could say if a person
[23:27] checked these certain
[23:29] boxes they were more predisposed to be
[23:32] open to the idea of Bitcoin but I don't
[23:34] think that anybody can articulate well
[23:37] what those criteria are
[23:39] because the range at an individual level
[23:43] it's like you could take two of of what
[23:46] I otherwise look like the same person
[23:49] and one person could get it and one
[23:50] person couldn't um it might be the
[23:53] people that really value Freedom or are
[23:56] more conscious of privacy issues
[23:59] again it's it's not like a if you had
[24:02] this IQ or you you know were this type
[24:04] of educated or if you grew up in this
[24:06] socioeconomic condition that doesn't
[24:08] seem to be what's dictating who sees and
[24:10] who doesn't see Bitcoin so I think that
[24:13] it's less retail versus institution it's
[24:15] more down to bitcoin is difficult to see
[24:18] it comes down to an individual beginning
[24:21] to understand it and then that
[24:23] individual making a decision for themsel
[24:26] or if they're a powerful person in large
[24:28] corporation that they can influence that
[24:30] decision because like we see with Black
[24:32] Rock black rock is advancing a Bitcoin
[24:34] ETF Vanguard is not you know
[24:38] to massive institutions in taking
[24:42] different actions as it relates to
[24:44] bitcoin how we get from where we are
[24:47] today to that future
[24:50] where 5% of people hold Bitcoin I think
[24:53] it's a combination of
[24:55] things part of it is simply a function
[24:57] of time
[24:59] knowledge dist knowledge distributes is
[25:01] a function of time so more people
[25:03] reading books more people listening to
[25:07] podcasts more things playing out in the
[25:09] real world bitcoiners out there talking
[25:12] about how there's problems with printing
[25:14] money that might be intuitive common
[25:16] sense to certain people but as people
[25:19] see it more and can connect it to
[25:21] bitcoin because that is what happens
[25:23] generally someone has to have learned
[25:26] something have some prior knowledge of
[25:27] Bitcoin and then connect connected to a
[25:29] real world event so as more time passes
[25:32] more people accumulate that prior
[25:34] knowledge and then more real world
[25:35] events occur that make it make sense the
[25:40] US government in 2020 to 2022 printing
[25:43] $5 trillion Canadian truckers protesting
[25:45] and then them getting cut off their bank
[25:47] accounts and being censored and people
[25:51] who donated to them basically having
[25:53] their due no due process and getting
[25:55] kicked off their bank accounts when
[25:58] Russia got essentially their assets
[26:00] Frozen by the US government or kicked
[26:02] off of Swift more of those events will
[26:05] happen and my view of it is that if
[26:10] Bitcoin adoption happens as knowledge
[26:12] distributes knowledge distributes in an
[26:14] accelerating way
[26:16] so it just gets the like you were
[26:19] describing about the kind of the
[26:21] exponential curve if you imagine one
[26:24] person telling their five friends and
[26:25] their five friends telling their five
[26:26] friends and you know and so on it it
[26:29] gets rapid very quickly that's why I see
[26:33] it's very difficult for me to believe
[26:34] that Bitcoin doesn't become the standard
[26:36] deao money in the next 10 years if it's
[26:38] come this far into the first 15 and if
[26:41] the distribution of knowledge and the
[26:43] development of infrastructure
[26:44] accelerates so I think it's part just
[26:46] time it's also
[26:49] part Bitcoin infrastructure becoming
[26:53] more and more uh proficient more and
[26:56] more valuable one of the things that
[26:58] people struggle to understand about
[27:00] Bitcoin is they they'll often say well I
[27:02] can't use it at my grocery store well
[27:05] people are starting to demand bitcoin's
[27:07] payments if Bitcoin adoption is still
[27:10] very early then the adoption of Bitcoin
[27:12] from a payment perspective is even
[27:14] earlier but that is happening more and
[27:17] more and as a few of those dominoes fall
[27:21] where people can see and say well oh you
[27:24] can maybe I can't accept a micr store
[27:26] but there are grocery stores that accept
[27:28] it
[27:29] that that the the connection of Bitcoin
[27:32] to money as they people start to see it
[27:34] being used more commonly is what they
[27:37] understand money to be day-to-day that
[27:39] that will be an unlock that that helps
[27:42] kind of bring everything full circle but
[27:45] you know it won't just be that it will
[27:47] be
[27:48] more financial institutions like Black
[27:51] Rock adopting Bitcoin more corporations
[27:53] putting it on their balance sheet more
[27:55] institutions generally getting involved
[27:57] more infrastructure being built to to
[27:59] custody it you know so it's not just
[28:01] about oh we need payments but as people
[28:05] see money working like even if it
[28:08] remains volatile at that time will
[28:09] certainly help the unlock happen without
[28:12] people needing to do as much conscious
[28:15] work to to read and educate themselves
[28:17] but also if you just think about the law
[28:20] of numbers and these accelerating
[28:22] patterns think about if one in a
[28:23] thousand people understood Bitcoin that
[28:27] means that 900 9 of each thousand
[28:31] doesn't one out of 100 might seem like a
[28:34] small number but if you apply that
[28:39] globally to 8 billion
[28:42] people well what's 1% of 8
[28:47] billion 8 80 million like 80 million is
[28:51] a very large number in absolute terms
[28:55] such that if that number 80 million
[28:57] would only 8,000 if 80 million people
[29:01] have come to the conclusion that Bitcoin
[29:02] is
[29:03] money it becomes harder for the other
[29:08] 7.9 billion people to say no and and
[29:12] what that translates into your data- day
[29:14] life
[29:15] is if one out of a 100 people understand
[29:17] Bitcoin you know someone that you think
[29:20] is not crazy that's otherwise a
[29:23] reasonable Common Sense person that has
[29:26] come to this conclusion as more people
[29:28] go before you the next one out of a 100
[29:31] is definitionally easier it's easier to
[29:33] see Bitcoin as money as more people have
[29:36] come to that conclusion before you and
[29:38] we're getting to that point of critical
[29:40] mass where it should become easier for
[29:42] people to look around the world and
[29:44] saying all these people can can't be
[29:47] crazy and they can't all be collectively
[29:49] hallucinating if Bitcoin is storing $2
[29:52] trillion dollar worth of purchasing
[29:53] power I partnered up with coin vigilante
[29:58] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[30:01] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[30:03] look at that beauty I love it so much
[30:06] coin vigilante made in perfect Bitcoin
[30:09] watch that's the perfect subtle elegant
[30:12] way to go out there and show that you
[30:14] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[30:18] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[30:21] dropped a completely new and amazing
[30:24] Genesis edition of their watch
[30:26] collections you have to date of the
[30:29] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[30:32] and of course also the block height and
[30:35] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[30:38] level of detail they put in in this
[30:41] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[30:43] those amazing coin vigilante the time
[30:46] pieces down in the descriptions I love
[30:48] those watches so so much if you watch or
[30:52] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[30:54] I'll guess you already bought some
[30:56] Bitcoin and now most important step is
[30:59] to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in
[31:02] a hardware wallet my personal
[31:04] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[31:06] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[31:09] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[31:11] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[31:14] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[31:18] with the code Robin at the checkout
[31:20] visit bitbox dowis SL robobin to get
[31:24] your bitbox and the next step is to
[31:26] really level up your sovereignty as an
[31:29] individual you have to have the most
[31:31] secure self- custody setup you have to
[31:33] secure your own devices you have to
[31:36] protect your privacy you have to set up
[31:39] an inheritance plan and depending on
[31:42] where you live you even want to have a
[31:44] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[31:47] in case something goes really really
[31:49] wrong and through all those steps the
[31:51] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[31:54] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin

[32:07] 80 million is a lot because it's 10
[32:10] times Austria because I live in Austria
[32:13] so I think that's a it's a nice way to
[32:15] look at it by the way also for for
[32:16] medium exchange things because you
[32:18] mention it um I'm a happy customer of
[32:21] sepide I use it to accept payments from
[32:23] a podcast uh on for the for the
[32:26] sponsorships uh and works really great
[32:29] and I think it showed me the power of
[32:32] accepting payments in Bitcoin because
[32:34] you always like get paid for the next
[32:35] three months uh and uh you really try to
[32:39] more more think in terms of Bitcoin like
[32:42] it's just like the next step of not not
[32:45] only I just get feared and stored in
[32:48] Bitcoin but I get
[32:50] directly uh Bitcoin directly Sates into
[32:54] my wallet which is an amazing feeling so
[32:56] I really do like that and and had it the
[32:58] first time ever in this year uh and I
[33:01] did it with sapat and it's really really
[33:02] good um how important is is adopting
[33:07] Bitcoin on this medium exchange side of
[33:09] things a lot of the narrative right now
[33:11] is on store of value on on like how to
[33:14] put it on a treasury how to put it on on
[33:16] your savings account uh and and on your
[33:19] strategic Reserve not a lot of talks uh
[33:23] outside of the hardcore Bitcoin uh crew
[33:26] uh about of exchange uh how important
[33:29] this is that for the adoption phase well
[33:32] a couple things to think about which are
[33:35] I think there's a logical order to
[33:38] bitcoin adoption which is generally
[33:40] somebody needs to understand why Bitcoin
[33:42] stores value
[33:45] first before they're willing to accept
[33:48] it directly as payment and baked into
[33:52] there is really this idea
[33:55] that it's easier to buy buy $10 of
[33:58] Bitcoin on an exchange or $100 of
[34:01] Bitcoin or something functionally
[34:04] immaterial or even non- immaterial to
[34:08] yourself that it is to make the decision
[34:11] if you're if you run a business or you
[34:13] offer a service to invest in
[34:14] infrastructure to accept it as payment
[34:16] and why would you accept Bitcoin as
[34:20] payment if you don't have a basis to
[34:23] understand why from that point forward
[34:25] even if Bitcoin is volatile to to
[34:27] reliably store value over time it's very
[34:31] logical to to do the former first and
[34:34] then once you've gotten to that point
[34:36] and I always I beat a dead horse on this
[34:38] for people that are listening for the
[34:41] first time or their newcomers to bitcoin
[34:43] which is in my view the short of it it's
[34:46] more complex than this but that that
[34:48] Bitcoin stores value reliably over time
[34:51] for the reason the fundamental reason
[34:53] that it has a fixed Supply that is
[34:57] credibly incredibly is an important word
[34:59] that is credibly enforced without the
[35:01] need for trust and that that is
[35:02] non-trivial and that's bitcoin's core
[35:04] Innovation if you don't have some
[35:06] understanding of the fact that that is
[35:09] the signal or some building block to
[35:12] know that it's reliable or that it's
[35:14] credible you don't really have a basis
[35:16] to know from this point forward if I
[35:18] take this payment in in Bitcoin and I
[35:20] hold it over time that it will it will
[35:23] store and allow me to
[35:24] convert you know into a equivalent or
[35:27] greater amount of value into the future
[35:29] if I don't have that Baseline I
[35:31] shouldn't be accepting Bitcoin as
[35:32] payment I should be listening to a
[35:34] podcast I should be reading a book and
[35:36] trying to to Grapple with that first but
[35:39] then once you've come to that point once
[35:41] you understand I understand why Bitcoin
[35:43] stores value better than or I understand
[35:45] why it soures value and I understand why
[35:47] Fiat loses value and by a derivative I
[35:51] understand why Bitcoin stores value
[35:52] better than Fiat
[35:53] currencies then it just becomes very
[35:57] logical if you run a business and you
[35:59] have that prior knowledge to realize
[36:02] that accepting Bitcoin as payment is the
[36:06] most efficient way to get Bitcoin
[36:09] because the alternative is to sell your
[36:10] goods and services for
[36:13] Fiat and then convert and then incur the
[36:16] cost of the Fiat system incur the time
[36:19] delay in terms of the settlement to
[36:22] yourself and then convert that into
[36:24] Bitcoin which also comes with the cost
[36:27] so that doesn't mean that you stop
[36:31] accepting Fiat it means that if you
[36:33] could accept Bitcoin and you have that
[36:35] prior knowledge that it stores value and
[36:37] these are the reasons why it just
[36:39] becomes very logical so the way that I
[36:41] see this playing out is it's less so the
[36:44] the relative importance between store
[36:46] value and medium exchange is that once
[36:48] somebody recognizes why Bitcoin stores
[36:51] value and if they run a business it
[36:53] becomes the logical thing to incorporate
[36:55] into your businesses just say hey if you
[36:58] want to pay me in Bitcoin I'd like to
[36:59] have Bitcoin and if you do then please
[37:02] pay me in it and maybe I create an
[37:03] incentive for you because I recognize
[37:05] that it's the better form of money and
[37:07] it would be in my interest to accept it
[37:09] if you're willing to pay in it and
[37:12] so so it's it's not one or the other
[37:15] then the second thing is that I really
[37:18] view this this idea of store value
[37:20] versus medium exchange and connect for
[37:22] people I wrote an article recently
[37:24] called bitcoin's exchange theory of
[37:26] value where I talk about this in length
[37:27] and you can maybe include it in the show
[37:29] notes which is that Medium of exchange
[37:31] and store value are really one and the
[37:33] same that even if I'm using a fiat
[37:36] currency to buy Bitcoin and even if I'm
[37:38] not intending to spend my Bitcoin
[37:40] anytime soon Bitcoin is valuable to me
[37:42] and it's storing value between two
[37:44] exchanges I might get paid today and I
[37:47] might you know store it over a period of
[37:50] time and spend it at different points in
[37:52] time so it's not just two exchang it
[37:54] might be one large payment or one large
[37:57] conversion and then in the future a
[38:00] series of smaller purchases at the
[38:02] grocery store you know paying for health
[38:04] care whatever your day-to-day expenses
[38:05] are but that the stor hold of value is
[38:09] only relevant between an exchange on the
[38:12] front end and an exchange on the back in
[38:14] and so that is that is that is the
[38:16] function of money I deliver some value
[38:19] to somebody today I get paid in money
[38:22] and then I need that money to store
[38:23] value until the time in which I convert
[38:26] it into
[38:28] value produced by others and so there's
[38:31] this Natural Evolution that money needs
[38:34] to do both the Bitcoin Only Stores value
[38:37] because it is so easily exchangeable and
[38:39] despite the fact that Bitcoin is
[38:42] predominantly exchang between Fiat
[38:46] currencies and Bitcoin today more and
[38:49] more people are figuring out why Bitcoin
[38:51] stores value therefore more and more
[38:53] people are demanding Bitcoin as a form
[38:56] of payment just like your self and so
[38:58] the two go hand inand and as Bitcoin
[39:01] becomes more easily exchangeable which I
[39:05] would say applies to things like the ETF
[39:09] or more companies building custody or
[39:11] exchange services for Fiat currencies
[39:13] that is more exchange that's more
[39:15] opportunities for people to make it
[39:18] easier to to buy your Bitcoin but then
[39:21] also if you setting up away with zap
[39:25] right and we were honored to serve you
[39:27] you appreciates having you as a customer
[39:30] you're making an outlet for your
[39:31] customers to provide liquidity in a
[39:34] different way to to pay you directly
[39:36] into Bitcoin so that if they're holding
[39:38] a large amount of Bitcoin they don't
[39:40] have to go convert into Fiat and then
[39:41] take the Fiat and pay you and and all of
[39:43] you you know incur those higher costs so
[39:46] when the way I think about that as a
[39:47] microcosm is if
[39:50] there's say I'll just use the United
[39:53] States if there's
[39:55] approximately 10 places 10 companies
[39:57] that are offering Bitcoin to Fiat
[40:00] exchange and now there's something like
[40:02] eight or 10
[40:03] ETFs well what if there's a thousand
[40:06] Merchants you know what if Apple says
[40:08] you can sell your Bitcoin to me like
[40:10] I'll I'll sell my iPhone and take your
[40:13] Bitcoin the more people that are
[40:15] competing for exchange of your Bitcoin
[40:17] the more options the more valuable your
[40:19] Bitcoin is becoming and as part of that
[40:22] the easier it is to exchange Bitcoin the
[40:25] more value the better it stores value
[40:28] because the more General demand there is
[40:30] so I think that in the end it's critical
[40:33] it's just not something that needs to
[40:36] happen as a forcing function to make
[40:38] Bitcoin more valuable because it will
[40:40] just happen organically as more people
[40:43] understand the underlying medium it will
[40:45] it will happen for the reason that
[40:48] naturally the people that come to
[40:49] understand Bitcoin also run businesses
[40:51] and they'll act in their self-interest
[40:53] to demand it as payment absolutely and
[40:55] and uh even I even have the feeling that
[40:58] the bitcoiners in itself are very
[41:00] interal and they really want to do
[41:02] something for the world so probably a
[41:04] higher percentage of business owners
[41:07] than in in usual populations um one
[41:10] thing that
[41:11] we almost kind of have to talk about uh
[41:14] the big elephant in the room with the
[41:16] 100K uh we I fought uh last week even
[41:21] that we hit it but we didn't uh and now
[41:24] we're getting a little bit away from
[41:26] that um as someone that is since a
[41:29] little bit longer time in in Bitcoin how
[41:33] how meaningful is that 100K H how
[41:37] important is that also for mainstream
[41:39] adoption use coverage how how important
[41:42] is that uh US dollar Milestone because
[41:45] just financially we almost hit it like
[41:48] we were like a few hundred bucks away
[41:49] from it so it does not make a huge
[41:52] financial impact at this point but uh
[41:55] psychological as as a meaning as a
[41:57] symbol how how meaningful is that
[41:59] difficult you know it's a difficult one
[42:01] to say I'd say that there is a
[42:05] psychological barrier and when it breaks
[42:07] it then it will become harder for more
[42:11] people to deny you know um that being
[42:15] said I don't
[42:17] know
[42:20] if 100,000 means more than
[42:23] 10,000 you know um because
[42:27] a Bitcoin wor worth more than
[42:30] $10,000 when a few years before it was
[42:35] pennies right you know it's like it's
[42:38] it's harder to square I think what it
[42:39] does in this case is as Bitcoin advances
[42:42] as Bitcoin adoption
[42:44] increases that 100,000 number will will
[42:47] make will have will will make it harder
[42:49] for people to deny like apple like
[42:53] Microsoft like nation states that coming
[42:57] that that as Bitcoin grows in value as
[43:00] it goes from a trillion to two trillion
[43:03] as goes from two trillion to to 10
[43:05] trillion it becomes the largest you know
[43:08] maybe not larger than the US dollar just
[43:10] yet but it becomes there's still
[43:12] individual companies that are that are
[43:13] larger than the entirety of what Bitcoin
[43:16] is storing more than2 trillion dollar it
[43:19] becomes harder for them to to ignore and
[43:22] that it it it requires or merits their
[43:26] attention so I do think that it's
[43:28] important I do think that that 100K Mark
[43:31] like is an unlock of like holy
[43:33] bitcoin's worth 100K like this thing
[43:35] isn't going
[43:36] away but at that same time like you
[43:39] mentioned it's you know what's the
[43:41] difference between 998 you know um and I
[43:44] think that
[43:46] naturally what what is more important is
[43:49] Bitcoin finding an equilibrium at these
[43:51] higher thresholds where when Bitcoin
[43:53] Rises rapidly it naturally needs to test
[43:57] levels that it blew through very fast
[44:01] for the market to see there actually is
[44:04] a equilibrium at these higher levels
[44:07] such that if it had blown through 100K
[44:09] and not stayed there and then dropped
[44:11] right back down the the most important
[44:14] thing is that it sustains those levels
[44:15] so I think it's actually very healthy
[44:18] that it kind of made several runs at it
[44:21] sold off and then the next time that it
[44:23] goes maybe it does maybe it doesn't but
[44:24] it's more likely to sustain it and that
[44:27] that what is relevant is not that it
[44:29] hits that price once is that it sustains
[44:31] a price above it that's what causes the
[44:33] the psychological shift of these larger
[44:36] pools of capital these large companies
[44:39] multinational that will start to look at
[44:41] Bitcoin and say this is something that I
[44:44] can no longer ignore what I'll also just
[44:46] say connecting because I thought about
[44:47] it when you were that when you were um
[44:50] mentioning accepting Bitcoin as payment
[44:52] is that there's a psychological barrier
[44:54] to like am I going to buy my first
[44:56] Bitcoin when it's 100,000 you know like
[44:59] there's that there's the newcomer
[45:01] dilemma of am I going to be that person
[45:04] and one of the things that you realize
[45:07] when you accept Bitcoin payments and
[45:09] oftentimes people who are in Bitcoin for
[45:11] a long time they recommend this is doing
[45:13] a dollar cost averaging or a Euro cost
[45:15] averaging where you just buy a small
[45:17] amount every day and therefore the
[45:19] volatility of Bitcoin is really taken
[45:21] out of it when you're accepting Bitcoin
[45:22] as payment my view of it and I've done
[45:24] this by experience sell my books for
[45:26] Bitcoin
[45:27] I was selling books for Bitcoin when it
[45:29] was 24,000 25,000 26,000 27,000 went to
[45:33] 40 it went back to 30 went to 50 went
[45:36] back to 40 I'm just getting a variable
[45:38] amount of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin that I
[45:41] am getting over time is storing more and
[45:44] more purchasing power but when you're
[45:47] accepting Bitcoin as payment say for
[45:49] your podcast for advertisers when it's
[45:50] 100 it takes that psychological barrier
[45:53] out where it's like I just got paid an
[45:55] amount of Bitcoin based B on the
[45:57] exchange ratio today you didn't it it
[46:01] might functionally be the same thing but
[46:03] when you receive Bitcoin as payment it
[46:05] there is something different about it
[46:07] and you can't know it until you actually
[46:09] do it where you're like oh I I didn't
[46:12] buy it at 100K I just got paid for my
[46:14] service when Bitcoin was 100K I didn't
[46:17] have to make this conscious am I buying
[46:19] now or then I I delivered the service
[46:22] and if I deliver that service over time
[46:24] I'm going to sell at different prices
[46:26] for Bitcoin but I don't have to make
[46:30] this conscious deliberate effort to be
[46:32] pricing the fiat currency to bitcoin I
[46:34] can just live my life and sell my
[46:36] services and over time the money stores
[46:38] value so um that's actually
[46:42] a it's something that makes that
[46:44] psychological barrier um less and less
[46:47] relevant for people that that are
[46:49] further down the adoption curve and are
[46:53] at the point of of accepting um Bitcoin
[46:55] as payment definitely feels uh different
[46:58] uh I I bought uh before I accepted
[47:02] Bitcoin I uh bought Bitcoin for over
[47:04] three years on on exchanges uh and when
[47:07] you directly get paid it it it feels
[47:10] magical it's something like oh like oh
[47:13] we did it on a I did it with an American
[47:16] company on a Sunday I I sent him the
[47:18] payment link with sap ride uh on a
[47:21] Sunday uh he made the payment uh and it
[47:24] just was there and it would have been
[47:26] such a headache at doing that with the
[47:29] Fiat rails and then it comes from his
[47:32] Fiat Bank to my Fiat bank and then from
[47:35] my Fe Bank to The Exchange from The
[47:37] Exchange I buy Bitcoin and then from the
[47:40] uh from The Exchange I still have to do
[47:41] it in a self- custody and so it went
[47:43] directly from his wallet to my wallet
[47:45] and not with all those institutions it's
[47:47] a magical feeling uh and you get
[47:49] addicted to that you really want to have
[47:51] more things paid in Bitcoin the only
[47:53] question uh that's hard to answer is how
[47:55] do you pay for your fear bills if they
[47:57] don't accept Bitcoin uh then you have to
[48:00] sell it or you have to borrow against it
[48:01] and stuff like that but yeah it's it
[48:04] feels like we are starting to build that
[48:05] ecosystem that uh that we need to
[48:08] actually have Bitcoin as as money and
[48:10] not just as a store of value that it it
[48:13] feels really good yeah that that's a
[48:16] great way to say like there is a magical
[48:17] feeling until you do that where you've
[48:19] delivered some value in the world and
[48:21] you're getting paid for and it just
[48:22] shows up in your wallet as Bitcoin right
[48:25] and like you also mentioned though it's
[48:27] like people that are that are that are
[48:30] down that curve that are accepting
[48:31] Bitcoin as payment they you have dollar
[48:35] costs right but you still have customers
[48:37] that pay you in or not dollars you have
[48:39] Fiat costs and you have customers that
[48:41] still pay you in Fiat right and if
[48:44] you're taking that Fiat and converting
[48:47] it to bitcoin you can go the other way
[48:49] right and you can really you can do that
[48:51] actually at lower cost but you you do
[48:54] that as you need to you're storing in
[48:55] the better form of money
[48:57] as your reserve basically and then
[48:59] you're converting into the fiat currency
[49:01] as you need to cover expenses and there
[49:04] will be this very organic gradual shift
[49:07] where you know you open up to one
[49:09] Advertiser and they pay you in Bitcoin
[49:11] and then the second one does and the
[49:13] third one does and as there's more
[49:16] people paying in Bitcoin there's more
[49:17] people receiving in Bitcoin and so
[49:19] you're going to have certain of your
[49:20] cost like you can pay zap right in
[49:21] Bitcoin but from time to time you might
[49:24] have to convert back but that's actually
[49:26] a
[49:27] better proposition on average over time
[49:31] than the reverse than storing an excess
[49:34] in Fiat and trying to approximate the
[49:38] amount of Bitcoin at any point in time
[49:40] that you want to hold versus versus the
[49:42] Fiat so um it's about eliminating that
[49:46] friction where you like you said you you
[49:48] get paid on a Sunday like I was just
[49:49] trying to pay a vendor and I had to pay
[49:52] them in dollars and they changed
[49:54] something about how they received it so
[49:55] I couldn't a them I had to pay with
[49:57] credit card but they were charging a $20
[49:58] fee so I was trying to get my bank
[50:01] to enable a directly so that they didn't
[50:06] have to put in the authorization I could
[50:08] directly that's taken seven days and I
[50:10] was like screw it I'll just pay the you
[50:12] know 3% penalty to pay with credit card
[50:14] because I need the service but that
[50:17] there's a lot of friction there and so
[50:19] um being able to eliminate that friction
[50:20] and get paid in the better form of money
[50:22] like it really you you said it probably
[50:24] best there is a magical feeling to that
[50:26] and and if you haven't experienced it I
[50:29] just recommend that people who
[50:31] understand Bitcoin Endeavor to do that
[50:33] because it does feel good absolutely
[50:35] there is when you talk with uh a person
[50:38] that hasn't experienced Bitcoin payments
[50:40] they they say like oh like why why
[50:42] should we use Bitcoin for payments I can
[50:44] just use Fe it and store my wealth in
[50:46] Bitcoin uh but once you actually did it
[50:49] you you ask like why do we use feed it's
[50:52] it's so much more complex and such a bad
[50:55] system and especially if if you want to
[50:57] transfer money out of your own country
[50:58] in your own country especially in
[51:00] Austria it works very easily you have
[51:02] instant payments like you pay from One
[51:05] bank to another bank if they both austan
[51:06] Banks and austan bank accounts it's like
[51:09] instant they have it directly um but you
[51:13] go a little bit outside of the borders
[51:15] even like in the European Union uh it's
[51:17] it's a headache and especially if you go
[51:19] to America something like that's that's
[51:21] far away from Magic I would I would say
[51:24] anyone that does that uh I think agrees
[51:27] on that one it's also an interesting
[51:29] point that we are still at the moment
[51:32] where we can buy Bitcoin we still at the
[51:35] moment where we can exchange feat for
[51:37] Bitcoin there was an interesting quote
[51:39] someone said on the podcast recently as
[51:42] long as we can still exchange feat for
[51:45] Bitcoin we are early do do you agree
[51:48] with that is that uh something yeah that
[51:50] is a that is definitely a clear marker
[51:54] that we're not yet in the suddenly face
[51:57] you know that
[52:00] um another way to describe that is or
[52:03] you know what I would say oftentimes
[52:05] people people will talk about how why
[52:08] would I spend my Bitcoin if I can still
[52:11] spend dollars and there's a there's a
[52:15] rational side of that and then there's
[52:18] an irrational side which is if you have
[52:21] Bitcoin and you really value your vendor
[52:24] and they ask you to be paid in Bitcoin
[52:27] and you decide to pay in Fiat you're
[52:29] just externalizing a cost onto some
[52:32] vendor that you value rather than
[52:36] eliminating that cost and and and taking
[52:39] an action to help ensure that the vendor
[52:42] will be around and if you really value
[52:44] their service and you should want them
[52:45] to be around um but another way to
[52:49] describe that is hey if I go to the gas
[52:51] station and I pay in dollars like
[52:53] there's going to be a day where a gas
[52:54] station figures out that the dollar is
[52:57] devaluing so rapidly that they can't
[52:59] continue to reset the price faster and
[53:03] faster that they're gonna I'm going to
[53:05] show up and they're gonna say well you
[53:06] got to pay me in Bitcoin you know
[53:08] because the fiat currency is storing
[53:12] value or losing value so rapidly that
[53:15] they can't afford to continue to do that
[53:17] business and so when it becomes when
[53:20] basically when the dollar becomes so
[53:21] obviously volatile relative to goods and
[53:23] services or the Euro or the yen that
[53:27] similarly with an exchange it will
[53:28] basically be like the market will be so
[53:30] dislocated that that will be a sign of
[53:33] the the rapid monetization of Bitcoin
[53:35] and so long as Fiat currencies are
[53:39] relatively stable even if they're losing
[53:41] purchasing power every
[53:43] day it's not an absolute freef fall that
[53:46] that's also a sign that Bitcoin is so
[53:48] early absolutely and I have one more
[53:51] small example for that uh BTC was
[53:54] already on the on the show and they are
[53:55] completely only Bitcoin like they
[53:57] accepting only Bitcoin they pay only in
[53:59] Bitcoin and once you get that get down
[54:02] that road you're like I don't even need
[54:04] a KC bank I don't need a bank with all
[54:06] the regulations I can just like have a
[54:08] website and a and a bit Bitcoin wallet
[54:11] and and can do everything obviously
[54:13] there are a lot of sacrifices in that
[54:15] doing that so early um because um maybe
[54:19] the vendor just isn't open to the idea
[54:22] of of of getting paid in Bitcoin uh or
[54:26] you limit your customers because maybe
[54:28] there's a customer that wants to pay
[54:29] your things but he would only like to
[54:31] pay in Fiat for maybe tax reasons or
[54:34] something like that uh but yeah it's if
[54:36] you go that rout it's you have a whole
[54:40] bunch of of advantages even outside of
[54:42] using the best money ever you don't have
[54:44] to use that cumbersome uh feat system uh
[54:49] anymore yeah really really cool perfect
[54:52] then uh we come a little bit closer to
[54:54] the end of the podcast
[54:56] uh where we where I ask always uh each
[54:59] and every one of my guests one question
[55:01] and is always the same question what can
[55:03] we learn from you besides Bitcoin um so
[55:08] one of the things that I talk about in
[55:10] uh gradually than suddenly the book is
[55:13] you know while it's very much focused on
[55:15] bitcoin it's also focused on describing
[55:19] the Fiat system and really kind of the
[55:24] fundamentals of economics Beyond Bitcoin
[55:27] but the nature of money how money
[55:30] coordinates trade
[55:32] how money has emerged and how it's
[55:37] evolved over time so thinking not you
[55:41] know often times when people come to
[55:42] bitcoin they they think about it as an
[55:44] investment asset um even if they hear
[55:47] people talk about it as money but they
[55:49] they really don't have a baseline to
[55:51] think about well what what is money so
[55:55] all the work that do both on my blog
[55:58] writing gradually the blog is gradually
[56:00] then suddenly. XYZ as well as um in the
[56:05] book is is not just talking about
[56:06] Bitcoin but in relation to some of the
[56:08] history of money but also the ills of
[56:12] Fiat money the dollar the Euro the Yen
[56:15] um and then outside of that um my
[56:20] background is in traditional financial
[56:25] services and a restructuring work for a
[56:28] hedge fund so a lot of the the writing
[56:31] that I've done that I talk about at
[56:32] least publicly is um is focus on the
[56:37] credit system of understanding the
[56:39] Dynamics of why they always have to
[56:42] print money why why it's not a
[56:44] possibility why it's a certainty in
[56:47] those Dynamics so um people can follow
[56:50] me for that there's other things in my
[56:52] personal life that you know I do outside
[56:54] of Bitcoin but uh that you you know I
[56:56] might be able to teach something here
[56:57] and there about uh my hobbies but I
[57:00] don't think that was where the the
[57:01] question was directed absolutely really
[57:04] cool thank you so much for sharing that
[57:05] with us uh our end routin of the podcast
[57:08] is the previous guest is asking a
[57:10] question for the next guest without
[57:12] knowing who the next guest actually is
[57:14] and the previous guest asked you the
[57:16] question if you had to describe Bitcoin
[57:18] in one word what would that one word be
[57:21] beautiful Ah that's
[57:24] beautiful really cool thank you so much
[57:26] P for for being on the show um uh for
[57:30] for those people that maybe don't know
[57:32] you that saw you not a first time where
[57:34] can they find you where can they reach
