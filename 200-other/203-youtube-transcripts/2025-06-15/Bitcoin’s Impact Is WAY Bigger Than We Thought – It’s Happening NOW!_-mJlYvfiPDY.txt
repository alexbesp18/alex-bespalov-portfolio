[00:00] Bitcoin brings more Social Justice by
[00:04] giving everyone equal access to the
[00:08] financial system but uh at the end of
[00:10] the day uh you know we don't have to
[00:12] know how the iPhone works we just have
[00:14] to know how to use it and we have to
[00:16] know that it works how we want it to
[00:18] work and the same for the and they they
[00:20] spend they spend they spend they spend
[00:22] because economy has to go and that's why
[00:25] each title says buy uh it's a it's a
[00:28] commentary on this economic landscape
[00:31] that forces us to consume to that forces
[00:34] us to spend our money endlessly just to
[00:37] fuel the system other people that see
[00:40] the sticker and they she has like the
[00:42] Bitcoin earrings and they she has the
[00:44] message change the money change the
[00:46] world uh you can also ask yourself who
[00:48] is this woman who is this actually and
[00:51] then you can learn something completely
[00:56] different it's it's really cool uh to
[00:59] have you because I think most people in
[01:03] Bitcoin especially if they are active on
[01:05] on Twitter or conferences or something
[01:07] like that they probably have seen uh art
[01:10] uh inspired by you or by by you um uh
[01:14] which is super interesting to see uh but
[01:16] for those who don't know you uh who are
[01:19] you and and and next to it I will I
[01:22] think I'll already show some some Arts
[01:24] so people have an an picture of of that
[01:26] in in the head while you can can talk
[01:29] about like who are you and and and where
[01:31] you're coming from yes sure cool so I'm
[01:36] street I'm the founder of Street cyber
[01:40] uh we are international crew of artists
[01:43] who use the art as a medium to raise
[01:47] awareness about financial
[01:50] education about Bitcoin and how it
[01:54] solves the major problems of our
[01:57] financial system today uh which are are
[02:00] inflation borders privacy and
[02:04] segregation and resulting from this
[02:07] comes the social impact of money on our
[02:11] society and this is what we try to
[02:14] show in public to people outside of the
[02:18] space that are lacking financial
[02:22] literacy because uh we are not being
[02:26] taught uh about things like this nowhere
[02:29] not in high school not in University
[02:32] nowhere and we try to make the people
[02:35] curious uh so they start asking
[02:37] questions so they make their own
[02:41] research interesting yeah I think it's
[02:43] it's super important for Bitcoin to be
[02:47] as present as possible in as many
[02:50] different ways as possible so not only
[02:53] it being present in like libraries with
[02:55] books and it being present on like TV on
[02:58] like CNN and stuff like like that but
[03:00] also just on street and I think it's so
[03:04] it's so amazing to have like uh this
[03:07] caught my eye the banana I think there
[03:09] was like a a huge uh banana like a a
[03:13] huge um extremely expensive banana that
[03:18] was selling as an art piece I think
[03:19] that's probably the inspiration for for
[03:22] that by Bitcoin uh
[03:24] thing right that's um the banana I think
[03:28] uh it sold this year 5 million and a
[03:32] couple years ago for 200,000 and Justin
[03:36] son from thron he bought the banana so
[03:40] it also shows uh how art is being used
[03:44] as marketing and we use it also as
[03:47] marketing because you know this banana
[03:49] is popular uh in the art culture people
[03:53] on the street will see it they will pay
[03:55] attention and subconsciously they will
[03:59] read the text by Bitcoin some even maybe
[04:02] don't see it but the subconscious will
[04:06] read it and um it will it will it's like
[04:10] a orange pill so we always use um art
[04:15] that uh people on the street can relate
[04:18] to something that is relevant today and
[04:21] then we add the Bitcoin message the
[04:23] Bitcoin symbol or something connected to
[04:26] bitcoin to to show them something new so
[04:30] we
[04:31] use something that the person already
[04:33] knows and then we add Bitcoin as a new
[04:36] aspect to try to get them used to it I
[04:39] love that approach a lot how did this
[04:42] all started for you like how how did you
[04:44] get into uh doing that you kickstarted
[04:48] that you you founded that now you kind
[04:50] of inspired a small movement in there
[04:53] how how to this get
[04:54] started right so I started with Bitcoin
[04:58] in 2004 14
[05:01] 2015 uh this was the moment where I
[05:04] realized that uh the financial system is
[05:08] uh corrupt in itself and that uh to win
[05:12] this game this economic game uh there
[05:15] needs something else than what we had at
[05:18] this time and Bitcoin was this something
[05:22] else and uh I realized it uh very early
[05:27] and uh now almost 10
[05:30] years uh I'm studying Bitcoin studying
[05:35] all the technology around it and it's uh
[05:38] going into many different aspects it's
[05:42] political it's uh scientific it's
[05:46] mathematic it's a lot it's technological
[05:49] so there's a lot to learn about it and
[05:52] um after like six or seven years where I
[05:57] felt uh that I I learned the base about
[06:02] Bitcoin uh I started uh creating classes
[06:05] teaching private
[06:07] uh private companies private people uh
[06:12] about it how to St right so doing
[06:16] consultations and um I wanted to reach a
[06:19] bigger audience so when I moved to
[06:23] Barcelona from
[06:25] Berlin and
[06:28] 2020 uh the city inspired me the artists
[06:32] here the street
[06:34] artists like buo or Co B uh or many many
[06:40] really great artists there AC a few on
[06:42] the streets they they inspired me and I
[06:45] started putting the the knowledge that I
[06:47] gathered over the last 10 years into the
[06:50] art pieces on a very basic level so a
[06:54] person that sees it maybe doesn't
[06:57] understand it right away but if the
[07:00] person gets curious and asks questions
[07:02] they will find the answers by themselves
[07:05] interesting I love that approach I it's
[07:08] it's super interesting for me when when
[07:10] people get the problems of the financial
[07:13] system um especially early on um but
[07:17] because most people never really pay
[07:19] attention to that most people are not
[07:21] aware of that even though they suffer
[07:23] the consequen of a bad financial system
[07:26] they are not aware enough to to to
[07:29] recognize that how did that how did it
[07:32] come to your attention was there
[07:33] something that like piqued your interest
[07:35] or like something that like oh like that
[07:37] can be be
[07:39] good so what opened what really opened
[07:42] my eyes was the the movie The Big Short
[07:46] uh that's about the financial crisis
[07:48] 2008 2009 uh it's explains really well
[07:52] what happened at that time and how
[07:54] something like this could happen and you
[07:57] don't have to do a lot of research to
[07:59] understand understand that the same
[08:01] circumstances that were valid in 2008
[08:05] 2009 are still continued so all this um
[08:09] things that led to this big financial
[08:11] crisis at that time they are growing and
[08:16] um they're not going away anywhere so it
[08:19] was actually really really easy to if
[08:21] you do did some research to see that
[08:24] because it's not a secret nobody hides
[08:26] this information and this was the point
[08:29] point where I understood that I have to
[08:32] do something different and Bitcoin was
[08:35] the answer or Bitcoin is the answer
[08:37] interesting I I love that by the way how
[08:39] did it come to to your name of like
[08:42] Street cyber is is there like obviously
[08:44] street art and then cyber probably from
[08:46] Bitcoin
[08:47] somehow right so it's um I create the
[08:51] artworks on the streets but uh it is a
[08:55] topic that is more relatable to the
[08:58] digital Realm
[09:00] to the cyers space so what we are doing
[09:03] is we are connecting the street the real
[09:06] the real world with the cyers space so
[09:10] so that that's basically the connection
[09:11] of like where uh the the real world and
[09:14] the the cyberspace comes comes together
[09:18] I I love that displaying the the
[09:21] cyberspace in in the real world and and
[09:23] ensuring the the future of digital
[09:25] payments and and digital money it's it's
[09:28] kind of um a great segue for for people
[09:31] in that way thanks yeah in in our
[09:34] experience in my experience uh it works
[09:37] very well uh when I used to explain
[09:39] Bitcoin I explain mining proof of work
[09:43] algorithms and all this technical things
[09:47] uh people they got drifted away very
[09:50] fast they lost the their Interest really
[09:52] really quick um when I have an artwork
[09:56] and it's the girl with the balloon for
[09:59] example
[10:00] and uh they ask me what it's about and I
[10:03] say the name of the artwork is Bitcoin
[10:06] is borderless and it means it's as easy
[10:09] to send Bitcoin as it's uh easy to send
[10:12] an email they they understand it much
[10:15] easier much faster that it's interest
[10:18] them because I don't talk about some uh
[10:21] Magic internet money uh I'm talking
[10:24] about an artwork that they can hold in
[10:27] their hands they can touch they can can
[10:29] feel and it makes them it makes Bitcoin
[10:32] real to them it takes it out of this uh
[10:36] digital world and puts it into the
[10:39] physical world because we are used to
[10:42] have uh money in our hand you know from
[10:46] the beginning of uh the invention of
[10:49] currency until Bitcoin of course we
[10:52] still have our phones but we used to use
[10:55] shells coins paper so it's our DNA that
[10:59] money has to be we have to be able to
[11:02] feel it to touch it and this is a really
[11:04] big um bridge that we are have to build
[11:07] uh for for many people to make the
[11:09] transition into the digital cach I love
[11:12] that picture I mean unfortunately for
[11:14] the people that are just listening uh
[11:17] but it's a beautiful picture where like
[11:19] there's a a small uh kid and uh it's
[11:23] kind of um lifted up by a Bitcoin
[11:26] balloon uh and it's it's beautiful
[11:29] and and here also like with the stairs
[11:31] like it's I like this symbolic of of
[11:35] that and you you get way quicker of like
[11:37] what what Bitcoin really tries to to do
[11:40] I I I do like that that one I think I
[11:44] don't know uh which one would you say is
[11:46] the most popular but I think that's the
[11:48] one I saw the most the the monkey with
[11:50] the Bitcoin classes with like be your
[11:53] own bank that's that's really cool yes
[11:56] Max Ka also likes the monkey was
[11:59] retweeting it and we also got telegram
[12:03] stickers I love that yeah that that that
[12:06] that's a that's a really cool one um for
[12:10] for
[12:11] Bitcoin um bit
[12:14] Bitcoin in itself wouldn't need uh the
[12:18] art aspect or the culture aspect or like
[12:22] even like podcast and anything like that
[12:24] um but what would you say is like the
[12:27] the importance of having having that
[12:30] great art uh um aspect for Bitcoin in in
[12:35] forming the the kind of the next money
[12:37] the next uh like ushering in the the
[12:39] next era of of financial sovereignty so
[12:43] in uh in my eyes Bitcoin already won so
[12:48] doesn't need anything anyone you know
[12:50] Bitcoin efficiency always beats brute
[12:53] force and Bitcoin is the most efficient
[12:55] technology that we have uh the most
[12:58] efficient Network the most efficient uh
[13:01] form of currency so it doesn't need
[13:04] anyone it doesn't need art doesn't need
[13:06] music it doesn't need anyone to talk
[13:08] about it it will win it's uh it's
[13:11] scientific and um so I think the most
[13:14] important is to have fun you know this
[13:16] is the most important we we have our
[13:19] stack we are hodling we have longtime
[13:22] preference we know life is good we know
[13:25] tomorrow we will be richer than today so
[13:27] what do we have to worry about nothing
[13:29] so we try to make the best out of it we
[13:31] try to have fun and our mission is just
[13:35] to let people know that Bitcoin is there
[13:38] Bitcoin already won Bitcoin is there for
[13:42] you it can enchance your
[13:44] financial um future so pay attention and
[13:49] uh it will it will it will help you and
[13:54] um but at the end it's your choice so in
[13:57] the beginning when I just started with
[13:58] Bitcoin I think many people can relate I
[14:01] was walking up to people talking to them
[14:04] trying to uh convince them and um it
[14:09] never ended good because you can't
[14:11] convince someone who who doesn't want to
[14:13] be convinced you can discuss with them
[14:15] hours days years but you can't convince
[14:17] them so with the art with the street art
[14:20] the people that are interested and
[14:22] curious they will see the artwork they
[14:25] will stop they will take a picture they
[14:27] will ask a question so so they will come
[14:30] to you instead of you are approaching
[14:34] them and trying to convince them and I
[14:36] think this is very important that the
[14:38] people that are ready that are open uh
[14:41] we have to give them the
[14:43] information uh which is already really
[14:46] great you can go online you can go to
[14:48] YouTube find many great podcasts many
[14:51] great technical
[14:52] explanations and uh I
[14:54] myself not consider like a technical
[14:58] person but to understand Bitcoin I had
[15:01] to learn about Sy system administration
[15:05] and all this technical stuff and um I
[15:08] did it just because it interested me so
[15:11] much but uh at the end of the day uh you
[15:14] know we don't have to know how the
[15:16] iPhone works we just have to know how to
[15:18] use it and we have to know that it works
[15:21] how we want it to work and the same for
[15:22] bitco interesting it's a we kind of have
[15:25] to make the uh the the thing obvious to
[15:29] people without uh trying to to pull them
[15:33] in in some direction because like you're
[15:35] totally right like no nobody understands
[15:39] how the tcpip protocol works but
[15:42] everyone uses it on a daily basis so so
[15:45] we we we will have we come the same
[15:47] conclusions to to bitcoin I guess right
[15:51] most people don't even know what the
[15:52] what it is what the term means if you
[15:55] ask them they don't know that it's the
[15:57] internet you know they just know
[15:59] it's much easier it's in inside it's
[16:02] just packed inside the the uh basic
[16:05] information so we don't have to make big
[16:08] uh speeches uh for the people that
[16:11] really want to understand something uh
[16:13] to understand it and this is what the
[16:16] the art showed me and I didn't think
[16:19] that it will work so great but it also
[16:23] has really well accepted in the art
[16:26] community and um there are there there
[16:29] are people for example they like the
[16:31] message but they don't like the art and
[16:33] on the other side there are people they
[16:35] like don't like the message but they
[16:37] like the art so sometimes when I on the
[16:41] street I see a artwork and someone
[16:43] crossed out Bitcoin symbol that I put in
[16:46] but they don't touch the artwork and
[16:48] it's an interaction with the community
[16:51] and um yeah it's something different
[16:55] it's something else that most people are
[16:57] used to
[16:59] it's it's super fun they they're like oh
[17:01] that that's a great artpiece but I don't
[17:03] like Bitcoin let's let's cut that that
[17:05] yeah yeah they just climb up climb up
[17:09] some fans just to uh to BL out with the
[17:13] mark the Bitcoin
[17:15] symbol but they they leave the out Cod
[17:18] is and it's just funny to see that
[17:21] there's almost like a a a street art War
[17:25] uh of like uh the the art and the
[17:28] messages
[17:29] that go on on those walls like it that's
[17:32] a world I'm completely outside of um the
[17:36] the the the the closest I am with in
[17:39] connected with that world is actually uh
[17:42] with that project of Street s because I
[17:44] see it on uh online and then I see the
[17:47] stickers I never seen something in
[17:49] person I think I uh at some point I will
[17:52] have to go go to a place where I can
[17:54] actually see it is there oh that's a
[17:57] maybe a weird question but is there like
[17:58] a map app said something that you
[18:00] considered like making a map where you
[18:02] can oh like here is something and here's
[18:04] something I noticed you have I think you
[18:07] had a gallery once uh if if I remember
[18:10] correctly but is there like a place
[18:12] where like okay like on that corner on
[18:14] that wall there there should be like
[18:16] something in in real life so I don't
[18:19] have a map but of course Barcelona is
[18:22] full uh of the art because we are based
[18:25] in Barcelona so the most work we do in
[18:27] Barcelona and uh uh what you saw it was
[18:31] a exhibition the art of Revolution
[18:33] exhibition uh at the art Vistas Gallery
[18:37] uh the exhibition is over but uh there
[18:39] are still uh art pieces uh in the
[18:42] gallery and you can also buy stickers
[18:45] there and posters also and um so it's
[18:50] all over Barcelona is getting get
[18:52] getting uh more and more and we are
[18:57] also working together with the city uh
[19:02] doing projects with the city uh because
[19:04] in Barcelona street art is very
[19:07] important uh part of the culture it
[19:10] brings a lot of people to the city a lot
[19:12] of tourists uh that are interested in
[19:15] art so it's it's really great how how
[19:18] the community here and how the city uh
[19:21] is accepting uh this uh form of public
[19:24] art definitely I love that yeah really
[19:27] cool by the way like how many
[19:29] um
[19:30] artists are working on that or like do
[19:33] you do you even know like how how many
[19:35] are are doing that street cyber
[19:38] out uh I can't tell you I don't know how
[19:41] many uh actually are in our crew because
[19:46] um it's uh growing exponentially many
[19:49] people they buy digital files online so
[19:53] I don't know what they are doing with it
[19:55] how how how they are spreading it but I
[19:57] know that there are almost in every
[20:00] country there are a couple people one or
[20:03] more people that are active uh that are
[20:06] spreading stickers
[20:08] posters and uh that are part of the
[20:11] street cyber crew uh also even wearing a
[20:14] t-shirt outside where on the in public
[20:17] where they see the message it's also a
[20:20] form of art it's raising your voice and
[20:22] uh uh speaking your mind and this is
[20:25] what streetart is about it gives the The
[20:28] Voice to the unheard to the the to those
[20:32] that are somewhere uh lost in the system
[20:36] and um it's in general so street art is
[20:40] uh most of the time it's political and
[20:43] it's about uh social uh problems um that
[20:48] should be paid more attention to and
[20:52] through through our uh art we bring the
[20:55] attention to the money and to the
[20:58] finance iial
[20:59] world
[21:01] so a new aspect to this movement I
[21:05] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[21:09] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[21:12] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[21:14] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[21:17] vigilante made a perfect Bitcoin watch
[21:20] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[21:23] go out there and show that you are a
[21:26] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[21:29] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[21:32] dropped a completely new and amazing
[21:34] Genesis edition of their watch
[21:37] collections you have the date of the
[21:39] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[21:43] and of course also the block height and
[21:45] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[21:49] the level of detail they put in in this
[21:51] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[21:54] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[21:57] down in the description I I love those
[21:59] watches so so much if you watch or
[22:03] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[22:05] I'll guess you already bought some
[22:07] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[22:10] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[22:13] in a hardware wallet my personal
[22:15] recommendation for hard wallet is the
[22:17] bitbox it's super secure it's simple to
[22:20] set up it's also perfect gift for a
[22:22] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[22:25] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[22:28] with the code Robin at the checkout
[22:30] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[22:35] your bitbox and the next step is to
[22:37] really level up your sovereignty as an
[22:39] individual you have to have the most
[22:42] secure self- custody setup you have to
[22:44] secure your own devices you have to
[22:47] protect your privacy you have to set up
[22:50] an inheritance plan and depending on
[22:52] where you live you even want to have a

[23:11] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[23:14] how you can level up your sovereignty
[23:17] really cool what is it about um street
[23:19] art that fascinated you in in the in the
[23:22] first place and got you into Street out
[23:24] uh what's uh most uh fascinating for for
[23:28] me was uh that it's uh real you know
[23:32] it's rough it's it's a it's a part of
[23:35] the urban landscape it's uh if you start
[23:38] once you see it you won't unsee it it's
[23:41] everywhere it's in every movie that you
[23:43] watch that is filmed on the streets it's
[23:46] uh when you go outside uh you it's in
[23:49] every corner and um it's like a movement
[23:54] against the the big media that forces us
[23:58] to uh consume the the products that they
[24:04] are placing outside like perfume or
[24:07] iPhone or the Louis Vuitton belt and
[24:11] that makes us feel that when we go
[24:13] outside and seeed everywhere
[24:15] subconsciously we think we need it to
[24:17] fit in we need it to fit into our
[24:19] environment because this is how our
[24:21] nature is we try always to fit into our
[24:24] environment and many people uh get sick
[24:29] uh get depressions because they don't
[24:31] feel that they fit in and we take we
[24:34] reclaim the public space because it
[24:37] belongs to us just as the money belongs
[24:39] to us it's it's like there's a lot of
[24:41] connections between street art and and
[24:44] Bitcoin it it it seems it's it's really
[24:46] fascinating of of how many kind of
[24:49] comparisons uh you can draw there I I do
[24:53] like that a
[24:54] lot yes uh it's really amazing how uh
[24:58] Bitcoin and street art have so many
[25:01] parallels it's Bitcoin is open source
[25:04] street art is also open source uh which
[25:07] means that the artworks that you see on
[25:10] the streets they belong to the public
[25:14] and I don't have uh any copyright also
[25:17] on the designs so anyone can take the
[25:21] design they can change it to their world
[25:24] they can adjust it and uh this is also a
[25:27] way to create International artist
[25:30] community and um to to make the people
[25:34] see that everyone can be artist everyone
[25:37] can be part of something uh bigger and
[25:40] it's as easy as putting a sticker
[25:43] somewhere uh even just on your water
[25:45] bottle that you carry outside and
[25:47] someone else see it or put it on some um
[25:50] light post uh sticker and you're
[25:53] designing your environment and you you
[25:57] create
[25:58] uh the future that you want to see by by
[26:02] raising your voice through ART through
[26:05] street art and there's also this aspect
[26:07] of street
[26:09] art kind of having to like it has has
[26:14] always has history because like there's
[26:16] maybe a wall where I Street up on top of
[26:18] it and then there there will come
[26:21] something new on the top of that wall
[26:23] and and it like has some some versions
[26:26] and it has some some new as ects of it
[26:29] uh it's almost like forks and uh and new
[26:32] versions of Bitcoin where like street
[26:34] art is also like a kind of progressing
[26:37] uh and I'm also really interested in the
[26:40] thing that you talked about before that
[26:44] um street art War form uh of like
[26:47] someone is crossing out the the Bitcoin
[26:49] symbol and maybe like making something
[26:51] else next to it uh and it's it's kind of
[26:54] a language between Street artists uh
[26:57] where they connecting and they they're
[26:59] talking to each other uh what what about
[27:03] the the the connection there and the the
[27:06] aspect of street art being a information
[27:11] war between Street artists even yes uh
[27:14] it's a street art is a form like you
[27:16] said it's a form of uh
[27:19] communication uh actually it's the most
[27:24] um uh you say it it's the most silent
[27:29] form of communication uh it's actually
[27:32] it's bigger than social media uh and
[27:35] it's also bigger than uh
[27:39] the the so the the
[27:43] media the mainstream
[27:46] media because uh you know you can turn
[27:49] off your phone but eventually most
[27:50] people go outside so the message will
[27:53] reach them sooner or earlier and uh it
[27:56] cannot be censored uh it cannot be
[27:59] controlled uh it cannot be stopped and
[28:03] uh uh it's is old for example the paste
[28:08] UPS so when we paint make a painting on
[28:11] paper and then glue it uh somewhere on
[28:14] the wall uh this technique uh is as old
[28:18] as the printing press itself uh putting
[28:21] some paper with wheat paste on the wall
[28:24] so it's a it's uh it's in in our uh
[28:29] every culture uh incarnated that um some
[28:33] paper on the street some commercials so
[28:36] something that always was there for as
[28:39] long as we can uh
[28:42] remember and um yes like I said it's a
[28:45] really effective form of
[28:47] communication uh when you said you you
[28:50] never saw any like stick or piece on the
[28:53] street but once you start um spreading
[28:56] like sticking your own stickers and then
[28:59] for example you know it's really it's
[29:00] really cool when you are in the city and
[29:03] you walk into the City and you look at
[29:05] some corner and you see a sticker that
[29:07] you put there after like a month that
[29:10] you put it there or after or after like
[29:12] three months H you feel like like home
[29:16] you know you feel ah yeah it's my
[29:17] sticker right there on the corner it
[29:19] gives you like a feeling of belonging
[29:21] into the City and once you achieve this
[29:24] uh feeling and then for example when you
[29:26] travel to barcel Ona and you see the
[29:29] same stickers that you stick in your
[29:31] neighborhood in Barcelona it makes you
[29:33] feel like uh welcome it makes you feel
[29:36] connected to the community and at the
[29:38] end uh when you take a closer look at
[29:41] the stickers and what we produce there's
[29:43] never somewhere it never says a name
[29:46] there's no signature it's just like the
[29:48] design and the message and it's intended
[29:51] because everyone can be Street cber
[29:54] everyone can be an artist and um it
[29:57] doesn't matter was it Street cyber who
[30:00] put the sticker on there or was it Robin
[30:03] or was it someone else it doesn't matter
[30:06] you know you just feel this connection
[30:08] to to to this uh community and it's
[30:12] really great you never really feel alone
[30:14] and at some point even in the most
[30:17] distant corner of this world there will
[30:19] be some sticker that you find because
[30:21] they're everywhere oh yeah like the the
[30:23] the small stickers I see a lot like even
[30:26] even in Vienna like even
[30:28] uh uh where like oh like there's a
[30:30] Bitcoin sticker uh and once you get like
[30:32] aware of it like you see more of them uh
[30:35] but like um what I meant is like I
[30:38] didn't see a really
[30:43] a more rare yeah they're more rare but
[30:46] the stickers I see a lot I mean only if
[30:49] I go to my local Meetup in Vienna they
[30:52] they usually have stickers and there are
[30:53] usually like also the street art uh
[30:55] stickers on it I mean that I think
[30:58] there's even in the restaurant where we
[31:01] usually eat I think there's a a picture
[31:04] of a street art in there I think he has
[31:07] some art of you as a picture in there I
[31:12] think how it yes that's delicious
[31:16] exactly like he has it on the wall that
[31:20] was really coola yes there three I think
[31:23] three artworks yeah that that that's so
[31:25] amazing yeah I just thought about it now
[31:27] like and uh I I realized it and we I
[31:30] think we even talked about it last time
[31:31] I was there like a month ago or
[31:33] something like that uh and it was it was
[31:36] really cool uh to to see that in a
[31:39] restaurant where you can eat
[31:40] unfortunately it's it's quite far away
[31:42] from my place not not that far away but
[31:45] uh it's in Vienna uh uh for me the other
[31:49] restaurants Clos otherwise it would go
[31:51] the way way more often um but yeah it's
[31:54] it's it's pretty it's pretty cool to see
[31:56] that in in in real life
[31:58] H how would you say in social media
[32:01] influenced street art in in the last 5
[32:05] 10 15 years yes I think social media
[32:09] gave street art more long-term uh living
[32:14] range or like a indefinite living range
[32:17] because uh streetart is about the moment
[32:20] you know it doesn't matter if your
[32:22] artwork will stay there for one hour or
[32:25] 10 years uh because it's about moments
[32:28] about what happens the time at this
[32:31] moment and uh it's always a reminder
[32:34] that we we don't have uh tomorrow we
[32:37] don't have yesterday we have now that's
[32:39] all that we have so it's always about
[32:41] right now and so because um street art
[32:46] doesn't have this um most of the time
[32:50] doesn't have a long period of life
[32:52] through the videos and through the
[32:53] photos that uh is possible to upload
[32:56] online and through the creation also of
[33:00] nfts or
[33:02] inscriptions uh it's possible to
[33:06] conserve um this information uh for the
[33:10] future Generations so they can take a
[33:13] look and see okay this and that happened
[33:16] on the streets and this is what I told
[33:18] you what I like the most about street
[33:20] art it's it's real you know you can't
[33:23] fake it uh you can't make it um look
[33:27] like you make a mural on the street you
[33:29] have to actually go out and do it of
[33:31] course you can make some digital um
[33:34] Photoshop but it will it's there you can
[33:37] see difference you can't fake what's
[33:40] real and this is what I like the most um
[33:42] that you actually have to do something
[33:45] to achieve your goal and of course it
[33:47] gives uh you some adrenaline push it's
[33:51] it's really great um just to to enjoy
[33:55] your time and through social media of
[33:59] course we can connect uh our community
[34:02] we can reach out much more farther uh we
[34:06] can um distribute uh our stickers uh
[34:11] worldwide and have a place where we can
[34:15] uh offer this and I think it's it's
[34:19] really important uh to not only create
[34:22] street art uh also I think even if you
[34:27] wouldn't upload
[34:29] anything and wouldn't be online at all
[34:32] it will be still it would be still
[34:35] successful uh because um like I told you
[34:39] the streets are the most powerful uh
[34:42] platform that we have there's nothing
[34:45] more powerful than uh the streets as a
[34:50] platform uh to to raise your voice and
[34:54] uh but the social media gives us um
[34:58] a place where we can gather
[35:00] internationally and talk with each other
[35:03] and connect of
[35:06] course yeah and then there's the aspect
[35:08] of like even if you don't take a picture
[35:11] and you put some some art out there on a
[35:14] wall uh it it's highly likely if it's if
[35:17] it's a good art that someone else takes
[35:18] a picture and puts it online and you
[35:20] might might see it so uh you you I think
[35:24] you if it's a good one and a good point
[35:27] and a good moment uh in the street uh it
[35:30] it it will find its way online I feel
[35:32] like yes it's uh uh it's for for our
[35:36] situation here in Barcelona I can say
[35:38] that we have three or four street art
[35:41] photographers that are actually hunting
[35:44] also there are there there are different
[35:47] uh the street art is not only about the
[35:49] artists there are also photographers
[35:51] that uh take the pictures that create
[35:53] books street art books coffee table
[35:56] books um that
[35:58] uh use those footage for their own
[36:01] projects and um we have three or four
[36:04] people here in Barcelona that are
[36:06] actually always uh taking pictures and
[36:08] uploading our works and
[36:13] um still uh through the social media we
[36:16] can somehow see also the impact of the
[36:20] street
[36:21] art it gives us like a direction to see
[36:25] uh what is happening of course we we can
[36:27] not really know how how big the impact
[36:29] really is because not everyone shares uh
[36:33] their story with us or let us know hey I
[36:36] did this in this project many people
[36:38] they want to stay private they want they
[36:40] don't want anyone to know that they are
[36:43] uh spreading stickers or spreading
[36:46] posters and they want to stay Anonymous
[36:49] so but through social media we can see a
[36:53] slide glimpse of the impact what what's
[36:56] happening on the Stream through the
[36:58] pictures that someone else takes or
[37:00] through the have also many journalists
[37:03] uh we had once recently interview with
[37:07] Forbes journalist who saw artwork in
[37:10] London and uh got
[37:13] interested so it shows us the the the
[37:17] this impact and um of course they
[37:20] reached out to us through social media
[37:23] because on the streets they wouldn't
[37:25] find us so easy but even to wait yeah uh
[37:30] sorry oh I just wanted to say like it's
[37:33] hard to to catch a street artist if you
[37:35] cannot find him
[37:37] online you have to kind kind of ask
[37:39] around maybe he's known locally or
[37:41] something like that right um sorry that
[37:45] I that I interrupted did you want to to
[37:48] say say more about that no I think I
[37:51] said like uh most of it so yeah it gets
[37:55] a lot of interest also from joural lists
[37:58] that saw something on the street and um
[38:02] it's really great I always like to say
[38:05] that uh Bitcoin is the tool and street
[38:09] art is the power to to impact our soci
[38:14] it's also like the it's also fascina I
[38:17] think people are extremely fascinated by
[38:21] things that are done in real world and
[38:25] then posted on social media like if you
[38:27] are scrolling through social media
[38:30] people seem to really be fascinated by
[38:33] things that people do in the public
[38:36] place and and and great things like
[38:39] dances art whatever in the public place
[38:42] in like Street interviews and like so
[38:44] many different Arts uh because it shows
[38:46] like the courage of like going out there
[38:49] and and and being your own voice in the
[38:51] public place and being vulnerable in in
[38:54] that space I think that's something
[38:56] really cool about
[38:58] being out there and and getting you out
[39:00] there and I think people are also really
[39:02] fascinated by uh that aspect of social
[39:06] media where things are outside and
[39:09] things are uh in the public place and
[39:12] interact with with the real world and
[39:14] not just not just like me with like all
[39:18] the same background where like most
[39:20] people don't know if it's a real
[39:21] background or like
[39:24] a just like an generated one it's a real
[39:27] one I think I never showed that on the
[39:29] podcast maybe I I can show it it's a
[39:31] wall basically that I could touch and
[39:33] and it's just LED lights but yeah I was
[39:36] thinking the same actually what you just
[39:38] said yeah I I think I think most people
[39:40] think that it's not a real background
[39:42] it's just it's actually a
[39:46] wall all right I I I could put some uh I
[39:50] could put the the monkey there something
[39:52] like that like some some some some art
[39:54] out there that that would be maybe cool
[39:56] to have like uh that wall completely
[39:59] painted with like a Bitcoin art and then
[40:02] like nicely lit up that could be a cool
[40:04] project for the for the podcast uh art
[40:08] and the background of it yes sure it
[40:11] would also give U more personality and
[40:14] um speak for you you know the artworks
[40:17] they speak for you so you don't have to
[40:19] say so much and just like the intention
[40:22] and also when I was uh creating
[40:25] especially the first collection the
[40:26] bonan
[40:28] one uh the seven designs it was intended
[40:31] to be um opener uh like I told you like
[40:36] if you talk if you explain an artwork a
[40:38] person is much more uh much more
[40:42] interested in listening and they
[40:44] understand it much better so the first
[40:46] seven designs um each has an explanation
[40:50] and you can use it also to open topics
[40:54] topics about financial borders Financial
[40:57] privacy segregation and inflation and um
[41:02] for the people really like I told you
[41:03] because they see the artwork they can
[41:05] touch it they can feel it and um makes
[41:08] it more real for them what you're
[41:10] telling them the
[41:12] information I also love the the one that
[41:15] you did
[41:17] with uh the white paper I will just
[41:19] quickly show to people oh now I clicked
[41:22] away uh the the I think yeah that that
[41:26] that's the white paper
[41:28] uh where where you kind of over the
[41:31] white paper there's art pieces and it's
[41:33] it's really powerful uh because it's
[41:36] it's really cool to hang the white paper
[41:38] in in in your living space but it's even
[41:42] cooler if the white paper has some art
[41:44] in it that that's even
[41:45] cooler nice thank you yeah it was also
[41:50] on the wall the background yeah there a
[41:53] I have to do a lot of thing but I I did
[41:56] that actually because I I was lazy I had
[41:59] I had the LED lights and everything
[42:01] already at home and I was like okay I
[42:03] want to make a nice podcast studio and
[42:07] uh then I was like okay let's let's not
[42:11] buy like furniture and put things and
[42:13] stuff like that let's just put the
[42:14] lights there uh and it was just a lazy
[42:17] move of mine but people actually seem to
[42:20] like it because it's it's quite unique
[42:22] and it it's very minimalistic and I mean
[42:25] also get the people also say it's too
[42:28] bright people are like it hurts my eyes
[42:32] because it's too bright but like yeah
[42:34] yeah I don't care you can listen to it
[42:37] but yeah let's uh let's go back to uh
[42:40] one more thing that that I really want
[42:41] to get in before I forget it um you are
[42:43] a street artist and you're artist and uh
[42:48] how and and we are a lot about surfaces
[42:50] in in Bitcoin and we a lot about the the
[42:54] how Bitcoin works but I think the the UI
[42:57] and the ux has kind of some still some
[43:01] improvement potential for for Bitcoin
[43:03] how do you see currently the the UI and
[43:06] the ux of the Bitcoin ecosystem of
[43:08] Bitcoin apps of the of the Bitcoin
[43:11] things the the layers on top of the the
[43:14] the back end of of Bitcoin do you think
[43:16] that it needs a lot of improvements or
[43:18] like how do you see the the the
[43:21] artistical or the the the the design of
[43:24] the Bitcoin ecosystem I think it's
[43:26] moving in a really great Direction and
[43:29] uh during the last half year year a lot
[43:33] of improvement H uh happened lot of
[43:37] improvement
[43:38] happened uh if you look at uh Noster for
[43:42] example Primal uh it works much smoother
[43:48] and uploads are working really great so
[43:52] they did a really nice job uh lightning
[43:55] is working seam
[43:57] LLY uh it's also really easy to use it
[44:01] and integrate into web 3 through Albi
[44:04] for example as a web3 wallet so I think
[44:08] it's it's really great and more and more
[44:11] wallets are being released by big
[44:14] companies and um of course there's
[44:18] always work to do but uh and and for
[44:23] like Mass adoption it's early but we are
[44:27] still early so we it's in time I don't
[44:30] think that we should have been somewhere
[44:33] much further in front than we are right
[44:35] now and I think when the time will come
[44:38] when when the masses are ready to
[44:41] embrace this new technology uh it will
[44:44] be all done and Set uh because it's it's
[44:47] moving quite well in my eyes yeah like
[44:50] the the things are moving in a in a
[44:52] really good direction I also think it it
[44:55] gets better and better with the with the
[44:57] minute but I I do think it it has to get
[44:59] even simpler I I
[45:02] think if
[45:04] you if you onboard someone on like oh
[45:07] like yeah you set up your self custody I
[45:09] think the apps just have to be so easy
[45:11] and so dumb uh to to use um but but
[45:15] maybe that's just my obsession with
[45:18] Simplicity
[45:21] uh on site of adoption so many times
[45:25] when people ask ask me uh what I'm
[45:29] doing and I tell them and they get
[45:31] interested and a lot of people they
[45:33] start they they start to also want to
[45:36] accept Bitcoin in their business like
[45:38] Bob my barber for example and uh I got
[45:42] them to download Aqua wallet and they
[45:46] they didn't didn't need any any help any
[45:48] questions and and in the beginning you
[45:52] have the message the important message
[45:54] right down your private key so so I
[45:57] think this is the most important for the
[46:00] for the beginning and uh they they use
[46:02] it they pay uh in
[46:05] Bitcoin and those are people that never
[46:08] had anything to do with it and just here
[46:10] to the term Bitcoin somewhere and um
[46:13] just are getting started same the the
[46:15] art gallery where uh we had our
[46:19] exhibition they also accept Bitcoin as a
[46:22] payment now uh also via lightning and
[46:26] it's really great because um they they
[46:29] have over 150 different
[46:31] artists and you can buy all of their
[46:35] artworks and pay for Bitcoin even those
[46:37] artists they have nothing to do with
[46:38] Bitcoin they maybe don't even like it
[46:41] but you can still buy their artw works
[46:43] with Bitcoin and this is I think the
[46:45] power of a strong community and the
[46:49] power of the art that shows the people
[46:51] that uh Bitcoin is not only about money
[46:54] Bitcoin is much more than money yeah
[46:56] that's a it's a great message like it it
[46:58] has so many great
[47:00] implications uh outside of of Bitcoin
[47:03] outside of money what do you think are
[47:06] the maybe the social impacts or
[47:10] implications uh that you see for for the
[47:14] world with Bitcoin like what Bitcoin can
[47:16] bring to the world uh I think uh Bitcoin
[47:20] brings uh
[47:22] more social
[47:24] justice uh by giving everyone equal
[47:29] access to the financial system by giving
[47:34] everyone uh
[47:37] equal um
[47:40] opportunity uh to participate uh in this
[47:44] um ecosystem and uh I would say not uh
[47:50] it's even more than equal uh it's uh
[47:54] it's uh open for everyone and and uh
[47:58] because in uh equality is not the same
[48:01] for everyone but um the
[48:05] opportunity on this financial system is
[48:08] the same for everyone maybe someone has
[48:10] to put in more work and someone has to
[48:13] put in lot less work but the opportunity
[48:17] to achieve uh the goal is the same for
[48:22] everyone and this is what the proof of
[48:24] work algorithm essentially
[48:27] uh secures uh that we have uh that no
[48:31] one can take uh this privilege away from
[48:35] you uh like it is for example right now
[48:39] with the Fiat uh system that uh not
[48:43] everyone has the same access not
[48:45] everyone has the same privileges you
[48:48] know if you have uh good relationship to
[48:50] your Banker you have much more uh
[48:54] possibilities than if you some uh middle
[48:58] class
[48:59] normal uh dad who just has uh his uh
[49:04] work life balance figured out and tries
[49:07] to do the best uh for them it's much
[49:09] harder and um Bitcoin turns the pillars
[49:14] pillows uh the pillars of modern society
[49:18] upside down so uh it almost uh makes
[49:22] corruption impossible and for right now
[49:25] our financial system
[49:27] it rewards the corrupt it rewards the
[49:30] scammers it's much easier to be uh
[49:35] corrupt and to do illegal things without
[49:38] being caught uh like money
[49:42] laundering or um things like this and on
[49:49] bitcoin uh it's more costly so corrupt
[49:52] Behavior trying to manipulate the
[49:54] financial system trying to manipulate
[49:56] the books so trying to hide uh
[49:59] transactions uh will uh turn out much
[50:04] more costly than trying to achieve your
[50:08] goal on a in a honest way and I think
[50:11] this is this strongest social impact
[50:14] that we have that nobody is excluded
[50:17] that everyone has the same opportunity
[50:20] yeah it's it's almost like it it levels
[50:22] the playing field if you think about
[50:24] like a soccer game um where yes the
[50:28] different players have maybe different
[50:29] strength speeds uh skill shooting power
[50:33] whatever um but they all have to obey
[50:37] the same rules and the rules are
[50:39] enforced by the Bitcoin protocol and
[50:42] nobody can cheat the rules uh so like it
[50:44] gives everyone the opportunity to play
[50:47] as great as they can and everyone can
[50:50] win um but uh there's still a difference
[50:54] in uh which which player you are uh H
[50:59] how strong your foot is and you can
[51:01] influence your odds of winning and you
[51:03] can influence your position in the in in
[51:06] the in the field when you train when you
[51:08] work out when you hustle this the kind
[51:10] of the proof of proof of work aspect um
[51:13] of it and so it it's really it's really
[51:16] great to to see that with Bitcoin
[51:19] because now it's it's about who has the
[51:22] best ideas and not who is this closest
[51:25] to the money printer and I think that
[51:28] will change a lot in society that that's
[51:30] an amazing Insight that you gave us
[51:33] today thanks yes it will it will be more
[51:38] inclusive uh Society also so uh what
[51:43] people will not be uh I think they will
[51:46] be more open and will unite and make
[51:50] people feel um part of something uh big
[51:56] absolutely I 100% agreed um what is for
[51:59] you uh outside of the the art and the
[52:03] the uh um aspect of social justice is
[52:08] there another field in Bitcoin that that
[52:10] excites you a lot uh the our current
[52:15] topic for this year that I think is uh
[52:18] very important in the time to come uh
[52:22] it's um about consume consumerism
[52:27] and uh because uh through in the last
[52:31] three to five years uh there was so much
[52:35] liquidity produced so much money printed
[52:38] uh like uh in the last 100 years uh
[52:41] wasn't
[52:43] so and um you you you when you pay
[52:47] attention you can feel that the people
[52:49] right now they are um spending much more
[52:53] they they are right now we we have
[52:56] economic upturn Bitcoin is going up and
[52:59] all those
[53:00] um uh fonts are also going up and
[53:04] liquidity is there we can feel the
[53:06] liquidity a lot of people traveling
[53:08] making big purchases cars and know
[53:12] apartments and um it's just a byproduct
[53:15] of this um money printing that gives us
[53:19] a little time to feel like everything is
[53:22] all right just before the next Crisis
[53:24] comes in
[53:27] and this is our topic it's the project
[53:30] tile that we started a couple days
[53:33] ago and um it concentrates uh about uh
[53:38] on true
[53:39] ownership and long time preference uh
[53:44] compared to the Fiat system where we
[53:46] don't own our money and uh this money
[53:50] has a shorttime preference which means
[53:53] that we are forced to spend it because
[53:57] today it's worth more than tomorrow and
[53:59] we even the people that don't think
[54:02] about it subconsciously they feel it and
[54:05] they they spend they spend they spend
[54:07] they spend because economy has to go and
[54:10] that's why each tile says by uh it's a
[54:14] it's a commentary on this economic
[54:17] landscape that forces us to consume to
[54:21] that Force us to spend our money
[54:23] endlessly just to fuel the system so
[54:26] then they can print more money that we
[54:28] can spend again and um Bitcoin is the
[54:33] answer to this uh it doesn't has to be
[54:35] like this when we have money sound money
[54:39] that we can hold that we truly own that
[54:42] uh doesn't get devalued every
[54:45] minute uh we can uh create an World
[54:51] which is much
[54:52] more um concentrated on cons
[54:56] serving uh our wealth and uh not just
[55:02] destroying and eating and buying through
[55:06] all the resources that that we can
[55:08] possibly pump out of this
[55:13] Earth I I love that aspect of uh what
[55:18] how Bitcoin influences our buying
[55:21] behavior um it definitely influenced my
[55:24] buying Behavior a lot
[55:26] and I think uh like every every Bitcoin
[55:28] I can relate to that like how Bitcoin
[55:31] influenced their behavior to money their
[55:35] uh financial needs uh and it definitely
[55:38] gives you a lot of things to to to think
[55:43] about in that terms um really cool um I
[55:48] I have one question that asked each and
[55:49] every one of my guests uh um and the
[55:52] question is what can we learn from you
[55:54] besides Bitcoin can learn
[55:57] about Street
[55:59] artart and uh about the
[56:03] reality of the streets and the reality
[56:08] of our society and of our life together
[56:12] here uh on Earth and um the designs what
[56:18] you can learn they inherit not only
[56:23] the lessons about Bitcoin but they also
[56:27] inherit life lessons that have been uh
[56:31] gathered by Humanity over the
[56:34] last decades uh if you just look at um
[56:40] the most basic uh design that we have
[56:44] this is the projectile it in the middle
[56:47] it says buy with the Bitcoin B uh in the
[56:50] background we use different patterns uh
[56:53] patterns that exist uh
[56:57] in our brains uh almost from the
[57:00] beginning of time since the human uh
[57:04] existed so like a square um U diamond
[57:08] shape pattern and even those patterns
[57:12] they have a lot of cultural and um and
[57:17] and um how do you say
[57:19] it they have a lot of cultural
[57:21] backgrounds and uh sometimes we use um
[57:25] Des that are more from inspired from
[57:29] Asia and so you can always if you pay
[57:32] attention and ask the right questions
[57:34] you can always learn more than that you
[57:37] see that's very true like you you you
[57:40] can get from an environment way more
[57:42] than uh just what you get on an uh
[57:46] surface level I I do like that a lot um
[57:51] just to take it one step further um our
[57:54] designs we always
[57:56] reference uh to different artists and we
[58:01] also reference to different iconic
[58:04] figures uh a lot of artworks are
[58:06] inspired by
[58:08] bangy uh some artworks are inspired by
[58:11] an artist named
[58:13] DOL and others um and many other artists
[58:19] that we are inspired by and we use um
[58:23] like Super Mario or Veta or Freda
[58:27] Carlo uh which was also really really
[58:30] great artist uh one of the greatest so
[58:34] when you look behind the message of
[58:36] Bitcoin you will always find some
[58:38] references to
[58:40] cultural um occasions to iconic figures
[58:47] uh for example Freda Carlo I think many
[58:50] people know her but uh other people that
[58:54] see the sticker and they has like the
[58:56] Bitcoin earrings and she has the message
[58:59] change the money change the world uh you
[59:01] can also ask yourself who's this woman
[59:04] who is this actually and then you can
[59:06] learn something completely different
[59:08] that's beautiful yeah really cool thank
[59:09] you so much for sharing that with us um
[59:12] we have an ENT in the podcast where the
[59:15] previous guest is asking a question for
[59:16] the next guest without knowing who the
[59:18] next guest actually is and your question
[59:20] from the previous guest is uh uh what's
[59:24] the best advice you have ever received
[59:26] let me think about it the best advice
[59:29] was invest in yourself this was the best
[59:32] advice absolutely that that's the only
[59:34] thing uh more valuable than Bitcoin is
[59:37] uh uh in in investing in your own skills
[59:40] and knowledge and your own time and
[59:41] getting your time back at it's that's a
[59:43] that's a great one yeah really cool
