[00:00] taxes are the worst possible form of
[00:02] government funding Bitcoin will enhance
[00:04] our individual Freedom much more
[00:06] important than what you can vote on in a
[00:08] democracy is what you're not allowed to
[00:09] vote on as soon as they turned to taxes
[00:12] it didn't take long until they turned
[00:14] totalitarian and ultimately collapsed
[00:16] taxes at democracy are not compatible as
[00:19] soon as you start taxing in in a couple
[00:21] of decades maximum a few centuries you
[00:23] lose the
[00:25] Democracy what will Bitcoin do to our
[00:27] society to our political system to um uh
[00:32] like you wrote the Bitcoin Nations and
[00:34] it's kind of like of this topic and
[00:36] asked often like what what will happen
[00:38] when once we have adopted a Bitcoin
[00:41] standard um like what do you think will
[00:45] happen well I think what will happen is
[00:49] beyond our imagination I think um as
[00:52] people 100 years ago couldn't imagine
[00:55] the technology of today I think we
[00:57] cannot imagine the society in 100 years
[00:59] but that are historical hints right so
[01:03] um in
[01:04] general what I say is that essentially
[01:07] money is the foundation of uh
[01:11] society and if you build a society on a
[01:14] on a weak money the same thing happen
[01:16] happens that happened to the Tower of
[01:18] Pisa right it leans over it leans over
[01:20] and some point it falls and um if you
[01:24] build on hard money um everything in a
[01:26] society changes because essentially we
[01:29] don't think of of money so often uh as
[01:31] we don't think about air that we breede
[01:33] right it's so fundamental to every human
[01:36] interaction outside of the family um
[01:40] that we we don't even notice how much um
[01:43] money influences us I mean uh you know
[01:45] cedine in the Bitcoin standard or many
[01:47] Bitcoin or Bitcoin fixes this to to
[01:49] everything and really what I tried in
[01:51] Bitcoin Nation uh to
[01:53] to um formulate as as as arguments is
[01:57] that
[01:58] essentially it is true right there's
[02:00] there's only two kinds of major problems
[02:02] in our society problems that Bitcoin
[02:05] fixes and problem that you can fix only
[02:08] on a Bitcoin standard so it's not like
[02:11] everything is automatically fixed but I
[02:13] don't think we can fix any of the
[02:15] fundamental problems in our society
[02:16] without adopting a hard money first H
[02:20] that's beautiful uh let's take one step
[02:22] back why do you um like what inspired
[02:25] you to write this book in the first
[02:28] place I
[02:31] mean a little bit about myself I'm
[02:34] originally an electrical engineer and
[02:36] after engineering school I wanted to go
[02:38] deeper into economics because I've been
[02:40] always interested in philosophy and
[02:42] economics and these two are very
[02:44] intricately connected even if you don't
[02:46] think so maybe um and then I basically I
[02:50] I went to some uh MBA um um lectures at
[02:53] the University and with the engineering
[02:56] mindset it's always about thinking
[02:58] through how things actually work I was
[03:00] sitting in this first two or three
[03:02] lectures and I was like that guy is
[03:05] talking complete nonsense right that
[03:07] that cannot be true so yeah I I I I uh
[03:11] then unenrolled again from the NBA and
[03:15] and did my own study and I very quickly
[03:17] came up upon Austrian economics but also
[03:21] um the writings of argentarius and um
[03:24] arant terius was a um German Banker in
[03:28] basically his um uh name was Alfred
[03:31] lansberg and he was writing as
[03:33] argentarius and he was basically
[03:35] explaining in 1921 that a hyperinflation
[03:38] would be coming in in in Germany and
[03:40] then wrote all throughout 1922 23
[03:44] explaining what was happening and the
[03:47] crazy thing for me was when I read uh
[03:49] his books that basically his his letters
[03:52] could have been written today our
[03:54] politicians are using the same arguments
[03:57] are making the exact same mistakes as
[03:59] they did back in in in VMA
[04:02] Germany and yeah then I basically
[04:05] translated his books into English
[04:07] because I thought yeah right now the
[04:08] world is on a dollar standard so that
[04:10] the English speakers need to know uh um
[04:13] uh about this and and that was what
[04:15] really kicked me then deeply into the
[04:17] rabbit hle I started then getting in in
[04:19] involved more and on the Bitcoin space I
[04:20] started working uh on the first open
[04:23] source projects and then based on that
[04:25] developed um this lightning POS uh
[04:28] device that we launched laed with opo as
[04:30] a product actually and yeah um I started
[04:34] thinking more and more about this but um
[04:38] while cedine in his Bitcoin standard is
[04:40] already very bullish on how um Society
[04:43] will change on a on a Bitcoin standard
[04:45] one argument that I was really missing
[04:47] is how Bitcoin will change our
[04:50] governance really how uh States how
[04:53] Nations how how human societies
[04:55] organization will change on bitcoin and
[04:59] um
[05:00] back then I was thinking about maybe the
[05:02] internet makes States as they are today
[05:06] Obsolete and I was very happy then when
[05:08] I was discussing these arguments and and
[05:10] writing about them um for the first time
[05:13] that I heard that just a few months
[05:15] before um somebody pointed out to me
[05:17] that balachi had published uh the
[05:19] network State and I was like really yeah
[05:21] cool then I read it and was kind of
[05:23] disappointed because on the one hand he
[05:25] says yeah the internet changes
[05:26] everything we can organize our society
[05:29] uh
[05:30] differently and we do that build a
[05:33] digital decentralized nation and then we
[05:35] just um turn it into a free private City
[05:39] that for me was like I agree with the
[05:41] first step but why is the Second Step
[05:43] necessary and and the thinking about
[05:44] this is
[05:45] essentially what I wrote down uh and
[05:48] then published as Bitcoin Nation or
[05:50] rather the condensed version because
[05:52] actually I I spend much more time
[05:54] shortening the book uh than writing it
[05:56] because I was so impressed by aarius who
[05:58] always really on point explain things
[06:01] like his book does Capital basically his
[06:05] homage to Marks where he debunks both
[06:07] Adam Smith and Marx and explains his own
[06:10] Capital theory in like 89
[06:13] pages and uh I wanted to to have the
[06:17] same kind of conciseness I I didn't
[06:20] quite manage it it turned out to be 150
[06:22] pages long but but in the end uh I I
[06:25] really tried to have a condensed
[06:27] argument why why is Bitcoin important
[06:29] for society and how what possibilities
[06:33] do we have with Bitcoin I mean I I
[06:35] refrain from going too much into detail
[06:37] because as I said I think that um once
[06:41] really a market process is kicked off
[06:43] and once there's a real competition
[06:46] between State Services providers um I
[06:49] think the same will happen that happened
[06:50] with the Industrial Revolution and and
[06:52] and people will come up with solutions
[06:54] that we cannot even imagine
[06:56] today yeah I think it's also um like
[07:00] when when always when we think of what
[07:02] Bitcoin can do for the future um we only
[07:06] know it directionally like the the
[07:08] details and what actually will happen
[07:11] it's kind of hard to to see but for me
[07:13] it's like Bitcoin will enhance our
[07:15] individual freedom and this is also what
[07:18] you wrote on the book with with like
[07:20] yeah kind of the digital citizenships um
[07:23] how you can imagine Bitcoin making the
[07:26] the world a little bit Freer um what are
[07:29] what one specific question I have uh how
[07:32] do you see taxes how do you see um taxes
[07:35] on on a Bitcoin standard uh is there any
[07:38] difference on on that topic I think
[07:41] taxes are the worst possible form of
[07:43] government funding and um historically
[07:47] if if you look at history I think I mean
[07:50] the tax system we have today comes
[07:52] completely out of the fudal system right
[07:54] it's almost one to one and um if you
[07:58] look at democracies before ours like
[08:01] Greece or Rome especially Greece is very
[08:04] clear you see that basically um they
[08:08] were quite peaceful right they were
[08:10] mostly defensive and they were even able
[08:13] to fend off the the giant Persian Empire
[08:16] completely without having uh taxes just
[08:19] with volun a voluntary system of of uh
[08:22] funding of
[08:24] government but as soon as they turned to
[08:27] taxes which they needed to do because
[08:29] now they wanted to attack back and try
[08:32] to conquer try to plunder it it it
[08:35] didn't take long until they turned uh
[08:37] totalitarian and ultimately collapsed
[08:40] and the same thing happened in Rome
[08:41] right Rome is a little bit different
[08:43] because they always had a kind of a tax
[08:46] system but as soon as they really um
[08:50] turned on the universal tax system
[08:54] um and started really taxing income as
[08:57] soon as that happened it took a few
[08:58] decades and until there was an Empire
[09:00] and then basically money printing
[09:02] started uh and and I mean they they
[09:04] lasted relatively long longer than all
[09:07] other examples that find but even then
[09:09] basically it was the marker of the
[09:11] beginning of the end so from from my
[09:13] from my perspective really taxes and
[09:16] democracy are not compatible as soon as
[09:19] you start taxing in in a couple of
[09:21] decades maximum a few centuries uh you
[09:24] you lose the
[09:25] Democracy it's a fascinating view um and
[09:30] when when we learn about Bitcoin it's
[09:32] always interesting what hurdles we have
[09:34] to overcome and you're an engineer and
[09:36] you write also from an engineer uh uh
[09:41] perspective and I meet a lot of
[09:44] Engineers or like software developers or
[09:47] other Engineers um that have a hard time
[09:50] understanding Bitcoin because they focus
[09:52] on like one aspect and they want to
[09:54] improve it their skillability and stuff
[09:55] like that um but in general I think
[09:58] every engineer who gets uh the the sound
[10:01] money aspects should get Bitcoin too um
[10:04] did you was it was it helpful for you to
[10:07] have this engineering mindset or you
[10:09] touched on it in the beginning a little
[10:11] bit uh or did it was it in your way on
[10:15] one hand it's helpful I would even say I
[10:17] think every University degree should
[10:20] have a basic engineering course in the
[10:22] beginning because what you learn in
[10:24] engineering school is really how to
[10:26] think a problem to how to understand why
[10:29] some something why a machine works or
[10:31] doesn't work and that's a universal
[10:34] principle like how how how all this
[10:36] works on the first principle basis that
[10:38] you can apply to everything else and one
[10:40] of the big issues in fields like
[10:42] economics is that the people in the
[10:45] field do not have this background and
[10:48] essentially they just get lost in some
[10:50] kind of meta discussions where every
[10:52] engineer that hears it says immediately
[10:54] that's just plain wrong if you if you
[10:56] look at it from first principles it's
[10:57] just wrong there's no no about it um but
[11:01] on the other hand I think money as I
[11:04] said is so fundamental that you really
[11:05] you need to be a universal genius a
[11:07] classic Greek philosopher Warrior type
[11:10] to really grasp it which is why I don't
[11:14] even think I understand it fully on all
[11:17] its implications but in general I
[11:19] noticed that to really understand
[11:21] Bitcoin to really fall into Rabbit Hole
[11:23] you always need two uh scientific fields
[11:26] for me it was engineering and economics
[11:28] I got first into touch with Bitcoin when
[11:31] I was um working at Rhoden Schwarz and I
[11:33] was there in the basically in the
[11:35] military communication security or
[11:37] Communications surveillance uh
[11:39] technology department and most of my
[11:41] colleagues were like in the chaos
[11:43] Computer Club these these um left wing
[11:46] hacker
[11:46] types and they brought me into contact
[11:49] with I think 2011 or 2012 for the first
[11:52] time and these were times when you just
[11:54] sent around hundreds Bitcoin for testing
[11:57] purposes right um but I didn't keep any
[12:01] I didn't really understand it because it
[12:02] was the same arrogance yeah this is nice
[12:04] idea but not scalable too slow etc etc
[12:08] etc and I think the hardest point for
[12:11] any software developer and engineer to
[12:13] understand Bitcoin is that there's
[12:15] really one counterintuitive fact about
[12:18] it because every technology in the world
[12:20] you want to innovate you want to build
[12:22] you want to iterate you want to try and
[12:25] error money is exactly the other way
[12:28] around you want to be really slow really
[12:32] careful and and if it works don't touch
[12:36] it go to a higher layer but don't touch
[12:38] the base layer because it's it's it's
[12:40] the foundation right and and what many
[12:42] Engineers don't understand is that
[12:44] tinkering in Bitcoins uh layer one is
[12:47] like uh saying yeah um this di scraper I
[12:50] like it I want to add 10 more floors on
[12:52] top and but now I experiment with with
[12:55] the foundation right now I I I drill
[12:57] holes into the foundation and checked
[12:59] some Plastics to test if that plastic is
[13:01] better than concrete but the risk is
[13:03] always that if you make an error there
[13:05] the the whole thing topples over and
[13:08] with the money it's like with a building
[13:09] right you you might think okay now it it
[13:12] works but 50 years later you you might
[13:15] see the
[13:15] cracks and and and that's the same with
[13:18] Bitcoin I mean tap rot was from my
[13:20] perspective the last really necessary
[13:22] soft for so we needed Tapo to be able to
[13:25] get Bitcoin to uh with the second layers
[13:29] to eight or even 10 billion
[13:32] people now I think we have everything in
[13:34] place in layer one to to to to scale to
[13:37] to every human so I'm my default
[13:39] position on any soft or hard for is no
[13:42] unless a bug is discovered or or
[13:44] whatever and
[13:46] um even with Tapo it was definitely
[13:49] necessary it was very very well checked
[13:51] by some of the most brilliant software
[13:53] engineers in the world and what happened
[13:56] it unintentionally brought us Orin and
[13:59] this this uh main layer spam so you you
[14:03] can never be sure and and even if you
[14:05] say it's just a small update I think the
[14:07] the if at all you should do unless it's
[14:10] a bug fig again big zoft Forks really
[14:14] think through what do we need and and
[14:16] treat every update like it's the last
[14:18] update not like okay we do this update
[14:19] and then then we do that update because
[14:22] the the smallest ones are are the most
[14:24] dangerous because
[14:25] essentially um one small bug in a single
[14:29] simple um innocent change might bring
[14:33] the whole thing down and you have this
[14:34] outsized risk right you have a very
[14:36] small Improvement but the risk is you
[14:39] could destroy the whole
[14:41] system this is uh and this is what what
[14:44] what is exactly against the nature of
[14:46] all engineers and software developers
[14:48] that always want to iterate iterate
[14:50] iterate iterate yeah every two weeks a
[14:53] Sprint meeting and iterating over all
[14:55] the all the small things and changing
[14:57] that um is it comparable like I often
[15:00] make this uh comparison with the tcpip
[15:03] protocol and Bitcoin as the base layer
[15:05] is that a fair
[15:07] comparison somewhat I mean tcpip is
[15:10] definitely not the best possible
[15:11] protocol for the internet but it's just
[15:13] a standard has so great networks effect
[15:15] and yes if you switch the protocol
[15:18] there's a there's a gigantic risk that
[15:21] you split the internet and have have
[15:22] interoperability
[15:25] issues I think as as crazy as it might
[15:28] sounds Bitcoin is much more important
[15:29] than the internet
[15:30] so and and Bitcoin would work without
[15:33] the internet but um the internet does
[15:36] not really work for society without
[15:38] Bitcoin as we can see by by all the
[15:40] problems we we're seeing arising
[15:43] currently right internet is a great
[15:44] technology but as you can see in a Fiat
[15:47] standard it has also has quite many
[15:49] downsides of the interplay of This
[15:52] Global Communication This Global um
[15:55] interconnected Society but the society
[15:57] not being able to really um interact
[16:01] because what what what most people don't
[16:03] get about what happens when a money is
[16:06] inflated is essentially um whenever
[16:09] these new monetary units are added
[16:11] essentially the person who adds these
[16:13] units overrules all the decisions all
[16:17] the purchase contracts all the work
[16:20] contracts that are out there right it's
[16:22] like 8 billion people decide this is
[16:25] right for me this is right for you we
[16:27] agree we do this deal but then some
[16:29] Central Bank comes in and says no we
[16:32] just change the terms of your deal
[16:33] unilaterally and basically let's say if
[16:37] you if you if you make a deal let's say
[16:38] you you want to buy an iPhone and the
[16:40] iPhone costs
[16:42] ,000 and you negotiate you get it for
[16:45] 900 okay you saved 100 and the merchant
[16:50] got 100 less same if the merchant rips
[16:53] you off and you accidentally pay 1,100
[16:55] so in some whenever you do a voluntary
[16:58] deal the purchasing power of both
[17:00] parties stays the same and the
[17:02] purchasing power in the whole economy
[17:03] stays the same unless the efficiency of
[17:05] the economy improves that's different
[17:08] with fat money right if you in the
[17:10] moment where you shake hands somebody
[17:12] doubles the money
[17:14] supply essentially it doesn't manifest
[17:16] directly but essentially what happens in
[17:18] that moment both of your purchasing
[17:20] Powers have been HED right you did that
[17:22] deal but in some you're both suddenly
[17:26] have half the the purchasing power so
[17:28] that's that's that's the evil thing
[17:30] about money printing that you're
[17:32] offsetting the um well thought out
[17:35] decisions of all 8 to 10 billion people
[17:39] uh out there right not now at eight but
[17:41] I always think about what happens in the
[17:43] future right we'll probably mix out of
[17:45] 10 are the current calculations and and
[17:47] you overrule all these people and the
[17:50] funny thing is when people say yeah but
[17:52] with AI then Central planning will
[17:55] work it's just also nonsensical because
[17:58] basically
[17:59] if the AI knew the subjective value
[18:03] judgments of all people and um
[18:06] understood what all people want and need
[18:08] at any time it still couldn't plan
[18:11] better than all 8 billion people doing
[18:13] their decision it would be just be a
[18:15] very gigantic energy hungry uh machine
[18:19] that does exactly nothing else than what
[18:21] is already happening in in market
[18:25] exchange it's uh this just came up in my
[18:27] mind uh
[18:29] about Central planning and AI um for me
[18:33] Bitcoin is a force against against
[18:35] Central planning and this kind of
[18:38] Communism world view is Bitcoin kind of
[18:41] forcing capitalism onto the world
[18:44] forcing for me now in a positive sense
[18:46] but uh yeah forcing to it I mean the the
[18:50] word capitalism is really um has a lot
[18:53] of balast going on right so I would
[18:55] really say free market exchange because
[18:57] capitalism everybody understand
[18:59] something different with it right just
[19:01] talk to a Libertarian he will tell you
[19:02] what we have right now is not capitalism
[19:05] yeah and um talk to a a socialist or
[19:08] communist he will tell you what we have
[19:11] is communism is is capitalism but the
[19:13] funny thing is the both agree because
[19:16] both see the same problems just the one
[19:19] say the problem I I label the problem
[19:21] socialism and the others label the
[19:23] problem um capitalism but in the end the
[19:25] problem is always that some handful of
[19:29] people is interfering with um the
[19:32] voluntary cooperation of others for me
[19:35] it's also fascinating because capitalism
[19:37] in the end uh like you need free Capital
[19:39] so uh when there's a Central Bank in in
[19:42] the country that that just cannot be
[19:45] capitalism for for me but uh yeah there
[19:47] are people that say oh it's capitalism
[19:48] it's it's wrong we should not have it
[19:51] um in in the broader sense when we go
[19:54] now to this um Bitcoin standard to this
[19:58] Bitcoin Nation model in the long run
[20:00] like I think it will be a longer kind of
[20:02] a transition um and I always think of
[20:05] the consequences this trans transition
[20:08] can have if people don't get it and they
[20:10] are then really late to the transition
[20:12] they might be angry they might uh go to
[20:15] the streets like it's so easy for people
[20:17] not to to go to the streets and protest
[20:19] against something um how do you think
[20:21] this transition uh could be Can it can
[20:25] it be peaceful like I hope for it
[20:28] peaceful Revolution to bitcoin but can
[20:30] or will it be
[20:33] peaceful that's hard to say that depends
[20:35] not so much on bitcoin but rather on the
[20:37] other side I mean right now we see this
[20:38] push for Global totalitarianism so all
[20:42] countries are really pushing more and
[20:43] more into your rights into your
[20:45] freedoms and
[20:48] um I think there's two really big
[20:51] advantages that biton has one is the
[20:53] just the demographic bomb that really
[20:56] Society is aging less and less children
[20:59] are being born especially in the Western
[21:01] countries so um there is quite Fierce
[21:04] competition to be expected especially in
[21:06] the next few decades uh to get really um
[21:10] the highly skilled
[21:12] workers
[21:14] and highly skilled workers are usually
[21:17] attracted by less taxes more freedom so
[21:20] whoever goes the the freedom the free
[21:22] market the Bitcoin way has an advantage
[21:25] over those who go the totalitarian way
[21:28] and
[21:29] that's I think the key driver that will
[21:30] help um Bitcoin win but it's definitely
[21:33] a race between uh the freedom forces and
[21:37] and the the totalitarian forces but
[21:41] essentially I think what Bitcoin will
[21:43] allow is actual democracy I mean anarco
[21:47] capitalists don't like that they say no
[21:48] we want Anarchy we don't want democracy
[21:51] but um I think Andreas Teel um Swiss
[21:54] comedian formulated that much better
[21:55] than I could ever have he essentially
[21:58] explained that democracy is the
[22:00] only known practical form of Anarchy
[22:04] right he explains that there's really
[22:05] only three types of um organizing a
[22:08] society one is anarchy nobody's in
[22:11] charge then there's um monarchy right
[22:16] one person is in charge and then there's
[22:18] oligarchy a handful of people are in
[22:20] charge and um the current democracies
[22:23] are much closer to oligarchy to than to
[22:26] Anarchy and and but essentially if you
[22:28] if you go with this model right um
[22:32] democracy is is like really one type of
[22:34] Anarchy there's enomy which is that what
[22:37] many people that are like opposed to
[22:38] Anarchy um expect Anarchy to be right
[22:42] just chaos looting but enemy is not
[22:45] really Anarchy because enemy is
[22:47] completely unstable right it goes very
[22:48] quickly into warlord Mafia type
[22:51] structures which are essentially
[22:53] monarchy or
[22:54] oligopoly so democracy is the only
[22:57] relatively stable form
[22:59] of that but one issue with democracy is
[23:01] that it tends to turn into a oligarchy
[23:05] and into a dictatorship of the masses
[23:08] and the root cause of this is
[23:10] essentially that much more important
[23:12] than what you can vote on in the
[23:14] democracy is what you're not allowed to
[23:16] vote on right what are the unchangeable
[23:18] rights the individual decision that um
[23:22] the group of people is not allowed to
[23:24] vote on um um anarco capitalists often
[23:27] choke that like um um gang rape U has a
[23:32] 90% majority vote
[23:34] right um so really important in
[23:38] democracy is what are the unchangeable
[23:42] unalienable rights and there's an like
[23:44] uh Tito gel model with fre pror tities
[23:47] okay we just have 100% consensus
[23:49] voluntarism we can only change the code
[23:52] uh if all people agree but if you have a
[23:56] slight understanding of philosophy logic
[23:57] and history you know know that can't
[23:59] work right there's this big story in the
[24:01] in the northern mythology about Bor the
[24:04] beautiful nice God that everybody LED
[24:06] but that got killed and essentially the
[24:10] gness of of Hell heal agrees that she
[24:13] will let him back into the lands of the
[24:15] living if there is 100% consensus that
[24:19] he should return and then the the
[24:21] trickster God ly um this gu is an old
[24:24] woman is the one who says no I don't
[24:26] want it and he's not brought back to
[24:27] life and I think that's for almost every
[24:30] decision right there is always one
[24:33] person that is against it and if it's
[24:35] just because of they just want to
[24:38] destroy it right so full voluntarism
[24:41] cannot work and then where where do you
[24:42] put the bar right this is 90% is it 96%
[24:46] is it 100% consensus for some 90%
[24:50] 60% the problem is how do you figure out
[24:53] what set of rules is the best one and I
[24:56] think right now the issue is that what
[24:57] we've been trying with the Constitution
[24:59] is we just do one shot right this is the
[25:02] Constitution and this should last for
[25:04] the next centuries at least we don't
[25:08] have this continuous iteration process
[25:11] with constitutions to get them better
[25:13] and the reason is because we're afraid
[25:16] that they iterate to the verse like we
[25:19] see right now happening right that
[25:21] gradually freedoms are uh infringed upon
[25:24] and then at some point the dictator
[25:26] takes over like has happened so many
[25:27] times
[25:28] but I think the the remedy to that is
[25:31] not to just say okay this is this one
[25:33] Constitution we need to protect that but
[25:36] I think really the the thing is you have
[25:38] to have a free market right people have
[25:40] to have the ability to just say okay I
[25:42] don't like this constitution anymore I
[25:44] want to
[25:45] switch but there then the issue is if
[25:49] it's territorially organized there's a
[25:50] really high bar for people to switch
[25:52] like for me I'd rather live in a
[25:55] dictatorship and fight Underground
[25:58] against it then leave my hometown that's
[26:01] um that's my issue and that's for the
[26:03] majority and this is for evolutionary
[26:05] reasons that is only ever a small
[26:07] percentage of people that are willing to
[26:10] uh to move to another country let alone
[26:12] another continent and the pressure has
[26:15] to be really really high for that to
[26:17] happen so um the only way you can ever
[26:20] achieve a free market competition uh for
[26:23] State Services is if your state service
[26:26] provider is independent of your country
[26:29] and I would really say before the
[26:31] internet that was just not possible to
[26:34] organize the society that way but now
[26:36] with the internet and with Bitcoin it is
[26:39] possible from my
[26:40] perspective and that that's really the
[26:43] the key dri I think will happen um
[26:45] basically the competition for workers
[26:48] will lead to States opening up services
[26:51] giving out digital citizenships offering
[26:53] service that they offer to people that
[26:55] are not living in their territory and
[26:57] over time I I think just the the ter
[27:00] territorial Monopoly will erode and at
[27:02] some point just
[27:04] disappear that's a fasinating concept uh
[27:07] I I have to dig deep into into that for
[27:10] me this is really uh forign I mean I
[27:13] with the sovereign individual the book
[27:16] uh it also goes in in in that direction
[27:18] right a little
[27:20] bit a little bit yeah I mean the
[27:22] sovereign individual is I think more in
[27:24] the direction that it will just States
[27:26] will completely disappear I I think
[27:29] don't think that will happen I think
[27:30] they will gradually morph into
[27:33] non-territorial
[27:35] entities then it will be basically more
[27:38] private
[27:39] entities I mean I think the distinction
[27:43] of public and private does not really
[27:45] make sense right this this public is
[27:47] usually just a label
[27:49] for it's public so we force you to pay
[27:51] for it right I think it goes more into
[27:54] the direction that basically um maybe
[27:58] there will still be one state services
[28:00] provider that provides jurisdiction
[28:03] police everything maybe it will be
[28:05] gradual right that you have maybe one
[28:07] provider for security one provider for
[28:09] this one provider for that but in
[28:11] general what will happen is I think this
[28:13] um competition that just necessarily
[28:16] arises will force these service
[28:19] providers to provide better services but
[28:22] basically to also
[28:24] um get voluntary payment right to say
[28:27] you get get this from me if if you
[28:29] choose me as your provider uh and you
[28:31] have to pay X for it and not this model
[28:34] right um You have you just have to pay X
[28:38] and we decide whatever you get and what
[28:40] you get gets worse of a time while what
[28:41] you have to pay gets gets increasingly
[28:44] higher like it is today 21 Bitcoin is
[28:47] Bitcoin only from day one and they teach
[28:50] and preach self custody this is my goto
[28:53] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[28:56] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[28:58] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[29:01] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[29:04] support this podcast use code Robin and
[29:07] click the link in the description uh
[29:09] when we look back in the the history is
[29:11] there anything that uh Compares really
[29:14] good to what's probably to come with
[29:17] Bitcoin is like with with when there was
[29:19] a gold standard when we were're Bing
[29:21] with gold and silver coins is that
[29:24] comparable to what we will imagine or
[29:26] will it be completely different
[29:29] I mean I think the htic city league is
[29:32] the closest thing right what they had
[29:34] was this several free cities that in in
[29:38] each City they had their own law code
[29:41] and the law code was Mo mostly Merchant
[29:43] law right really the merchants agreed
[29:44] upon the the basic rules how to resolve
[29:47] conflicts how how to how to uh trade and
[29:50] then there was basically the code of the
[29:52] league how we help each other if they're
[29:54] attacked and I think this is this is
[29:56] more um the the model that likely will
[29:59] happen and um I mean I think
[30:03] essentially free private cities are
[30:06] instable because they you can have only
[30:10] a small territorial entity if you're
[30:12] really free because free people tend to
[30:14] be very very um yeah unique right very
[30:19] individualist so it's very hard to get
[30:22] large groups of of um Freedom minded
[30:25] people in one area to agree on the same
[30:27] code
[30:29] and if you have one group of free people
[30:32] they get rich very quickly and they
[30:34] generate um animosity by the poorer not
[30:38] so free people around them and at some
[30:41] point they just band together in a large
[30:42] enough group to just overrun the small
[30:44] group so really what you need is like a
[30:47] a global League of free private cities
[30:51] counties um but I think the starting
[30:55] with a free city or a free county is is
[30:57] um
[30:58] the wrong order right basically you
[31:00] start from where we are it gets more
[31:03] free maybe there is leagues that are
[31:04] independent for States but say like we
[31:06] defend each other against infringement
[31:08] upon our rights we maybe um um have a
[31:13] common Lobby group that speaks in the at
[31:16] the United Nations or whatever for our
[31:18] interests and and then later we
[31:20] federalize and have like um Regional
[31:23] groups that have their own rule set and
[31:26] this goes also into I think the current
[31:29] um the current system of governments has
[31:32] this Federal concept because they know
[31:34] it's needed but right now everything's
[31:37] more
[31:38] centralized and quite honestly set up
[31:42] exactly the wrong way like for in
[31:44] Germany for example our education system
[31:47] is federalized each each of the each of
[31:51] the regions in Germany decides on their
[31:53] own education but I say exactly
[31:56] education that needs to be as a a maybe
[31:59] a certification on a nation level and
[32:02] then the free market should provide the
[32:05] education Solutions where you can reach
[32:07] this certification level right this
[32:09] shouldn't be something that's
[32:10] decentralized at all other than that you
[32:13] have competition uh of the providers for
[32:15] the education but the Norms really how
[32:19] to judge an education level should has a
[32:22] strong networ effect this must be as
[32:23] centralized as possible on the other
[32:26] hand um lots of regulations like
[32:29] building codes and stuff um these are
[32:32] centralized which makes no sense because
[32:35] they don't in my perspective they
[32:37] shouldn't be regulated by the government
[32:38] at all because in the end you're
[32:42] responsible for your own building if it
[32:43] collapses on your head or on the heads
[32:45] of your tenants and secondly your
[32:48] neighbors have to be uh in line with if
[32:51] you basically build a huge building they
[32:53] cannot see the uh the landscape anymore
[32:55] or whatever but that's that's really um
[32:58] voluntarist loc very very local uh
[33:01] decision-making scheme but it's
[33:03] completely centralized so we we have a
[33:05] lot of this backwards and I think the
[33:07] only way to figure out what is the right
[33:09] level what should be on which federal
[33:11] federal level or completely free market
[33:14] without any Central player this is not
[33:17] something one person can just say this
[33:20] is right this is something that really
[33:22] has to be tried and errored and and
[33:24] developed over time yeah definitely but
[33:27] for me it's uh it seems dangerous if the
[33:33] if a nation level is saying this is what
[33:37] every person has to know on education
[33:41] system I don't know if if you meant it
[33:42] like that but uh like then when Germany
[33:45] says like oh everybody has to learn this
[33:48] uh and they basically can say this and
[33:50] then you have to get to this
[33:52] certification level no I meant it
[33:53] exactly the other way around not what
[33:55] you have to learn but this the the the
[33:57] certific ation right to see if you have
[33:59] some education if you know engineering
[34:01] well enough if you know architecture
[34:03] well enough to build a house right this
[34:05] certification level has a very strong
[34:07] Network effect so the more Universal
[34:09] it's agreed upon a a certain test or
[34:12] certain certification the better the
[34:15] level on how you get to that shouldn't
[34:18] be mandated at all right there should be
[34:20] just free market providers and over time
[34:23] you find out how this is very reputable
[34:25] this is the best one then technology
[34:27] changes and the old frontal uh
[34:30] University lectures don't work anymore
[34:31] but the internet has much better
[34:32] processes than somebody outs them that
[34:34] that shouldn't be regulated at all but
[34:36] the
[34:37] certifications need to be as centralized
[34:40] as possible to just make them worthwhile
[34:43] right because um if everybody agrees
[34:46] this is the test for an electrical
[34:48] engineer globally I mean won't happen
[34:50] but if it's there maybe just two or
[34:51] three tests then it's easy right you you
[34:54] pass that test and you every company in
[34:57] the globe can just say oh he has passed
[34:58] that test I'm looking for an engineer so
[35:00] um I look at that person because he has
[35:02] passed that test so that's that's
[35:04] something that that's really um
[35:07] something that's gets more valuable than
[35:09] more decentralized so if there is Market
[35:11] competition I think it will maybe get
[35:15] two or three big certification agencies
[35:17] in the future uh on a global scale where
[35:20] you just get your degrees from but how
[35:22] you get to that degree I think will be
[35:25] um dependent on the market competition
[35:27] but I want to go back to something you
[35:29] said right you said it's it's bad if
[35:31] that's decided
[35:32] centrally I think the real problem
[35:35] because something is bad when it's
[35:36] decided Central it's not because a
[35:38] central committee made that decision
[35:40] necessarily but because you just have to
[35:43] accept that right that's that's the
[35:46] whole issue the Monopoly you have to
[35:50] pack your stuff sell your property move
[35:52] to another country if you don't don't
[35:54] agree with any Central decision and
[35:57] that's I think exactly backwards if you
[35:59] don't agree with a central decision to
[36:01] the point where say I don't want to be
[36:03] part of this nation anymore you have to
[36:06] be able to switch your nation switch
[36:08] your property over to that Nation uh
[36:11] without having to move right that's
[36:12] really the issue why we don't have a
[36:14] very uh very good Market competition
[36:17] between nations or between States
[36:19] because you're just basically forced
[36:21] this is the structure and you have no
[36:24] way to get out of it and and I think uh
[36:27] the internet Bitcoin and all those
[36:30] developments we see
[36:32] help get get to that uh vision and that
[36:36] future faster and I definitely hope that
[36:39] uh there's more competition to those
[36:41] States because every time I mean
[36:43] probably you have the same experience
[36:45] every time I interact with governments
[36:46] or government agencies uh it's
[36:49] inefficient like like when we just leave
[36:52] out the the the what what they are doing
[36:55] but just the things that you have to
[36:57] interact with them it's really
[36:59] inefficient and whenever you interact
[37:01] with like a company that has to compete
[37:04] in the free market it's usually like
[37:07] there exception usually really efficient
[37:10] they answer you fast because they know
[37:12] if you don't uh if if they don't do a
[37:15] good job he will just switch to another
[37:17] one and that's yeah I mean I think in
[37:19] the end it come comes really down to
[37:21] ownership who owns you right who owns
[37:25] your life your body because right now
[37:30] you have to basically you're like a
[37:31] slave you cannot get out you can maybe
[37:34] get sold to another or ask to be allowed
[37:37] to have another owner but you're never
[37:39] really allowed to be actually free and
[37:42] for me communism for example is not the
[37:44] problem if I say my town um is a a free
[37:49] town and we we trade completely freely
[37:52] no regulations and c and our neighbor
[37:55] Town wants to be a communist Town sure
[37:58] let's do it you can do it but there's
[37:59] one rule if any of your members want to
[38:03] become part of our town wants to play by
[38:05] our rules and not by yours you have to
[38:08] allow them that's that's the Only Rule
[38:11] you can do communism you can do
[38:13] dictatorship you can do whatever you
[38:14] want in your territory as long as all
[38:17] the people there are are good with it as
[38:19] soon as the people want to leave you
[38:21] have to let them
[38:22] leave yeah definitely um let's switch
[38:26] back to bitcoin and I often ask myself
[38:29] that like when we see all the Bitcoin
[38:31] books all the Bitcoin educational um um
[38:35] content out there uh it's pretty clear
[38:37] for me that like if you want to
[38:41] understand Bitcoin you can understand it
[38:43] in a week or two weeks uh
[38:46] fundamentally uh you have to you you
[38:48] have to break some barriers maybe that
[38:50] are pre in in your mind already uh you
[38:54] have to study like it's it's not
[38:55] something that comes natural to you uh
[38:57] if you are in the theat system for a
[38:59] long time but what's holding Bitcoin
[39:02] back is the pain not big enough do we
[39:04] have to do a better job in educ
[39:06] educating like why are we not at full
[39:09] scale Mass adoption is it just is it
[39:12] just a time that needs to be uh there's
[39:15] several points I think that I need to
[39:17] address one is I mean I would separate
[39:19] understanding Bitcoin the network the
[39:21] technology behind it and understanding
[39:23] money right that's two completely
[39:26] different things and you need to have
[39:27] both really understand Bitcoin as a a
[39:31] concept and and that's what many people
[39:33] struggle right if you just have one of
[39:36] the two then you're you're not really
[39:38] getting it and then every technology
[39:41] every disruption has this adoption curve
[39:43] and basically what we know is every
[39:45] really disruptive um technology once it
[39:48] reaches 10% in a decade it goes to 80
[39:52] 90% the thing is that flat part of the
[39:54] curve until it really goes vertical can
[39:57] be really really long this can be for
[40:00] some technologies a year or a few years
[40:02] like for the iPhone for other
[40:03] Technologies like 3D printing decades
[40:06] and decades and decades right and um you
[40:10] you don't really know one when that part
[40:12] happens I think we are pretty close to
[40:13] it with Bitcoin but we're not there yet
[40:16] and then you have to think separate
[40:20] um there's several aspects of Bitcoin
[40:22] adoption right store of value medium of
[40:25] exchange Etc I think lightning
[40:27] payments will get adopted quicker than
[40:30] than Bitcoin actually as your daily
[40:33] money because lightning is just so
[40:35] superior to the old encrusted Swift sepa
[40:40] uh um Visa Mastercard systems um that I
[40:43] think in a decade or one and a half
[40:46] decades likely 90 plus per of all
[40:49] transactions will be made of lightning
[40:51] but these transactions may still be
[40:52] sending dollar to um Turkish ler or
[40:56] something so I think lightning really is
[40:59] the troyan horse that pushes the
[41:01] adoption of
[41:02] Bitcoin um Bitcoin itself until it
[41:04] really gets gets dominant I think will
[41:07] take a few decades and I think
[41:09] the it will have to face its real um
[41:13] enemy right the real Nemesis of Bitcoin
[41:16] is not feat money it's gold or rather
[41:20] the the silver gold B metallic standard
[41:23] and if that comes not back I think it
[41:26] will get be much quicker because Fiat
[41:29] will just collapse in in the 2030s I'm
[41:32] 90% sure of that that the dollar system
[41:35] will collapse but I'm pretty sure that
[41:38] there will be some large um state or or
[41:42] League of states that will try the gold
[41:46] standard and that is then really the
[41:48] long face off right several decades to a
[41:50] century when when the old gold
[41:53] bimetallic standard competes with with
[41:55] Bitcoin so really that that adoption
[41:57] speed I think depends on if that's if
[41:59] I'm if I'm right if that standard comes
[42:01] back to compete with Bitcoin if it
[42:03] doesn't come back then I think it's over
[42:05] in a couple decades the gold standard
[42:08] but can only work in as you said in in
[42:11] digital area where you have something on
[42:14] top of gold right it's like I think it
[42:17] will be really hard to convince people
[42:19] to actually pay directly with gold in a
[42:22] digital era no you always have gold
[42:24] certificates but that's also why um say
[42:27] prefer going back to a gold standard
[42:29] than to going to a Bitcoin standard
[42:30] right because in the in the gold
[42:31] standard the mo large portions of the
[42:34] gold are still in the wall you still can
[42:35] have a national currency you can still
[42:37] dilute it you just have to be honest
[42:39] enough right the first few decades until
[42:42] you have outcompeted Bitcoin you can try
[42:44] to have 0 point something perc inflation
[42:47] try maybe even lower inflation than
[42:49] Bitcoin has in the current halfing so
[42:51] you can actually challenge it um I don't
[42:54] think it can win in the long run just
[42:56] precisely because in the end somebody
[42:58] gets greedy again prints too much um so
[43:01] I I I think Bitcoin is just simply the
[43:03] better monetary technology because you
[43:06] can actually with just 12 or 24 words
[43:09] can hold your Bitcoin and you know these
[43:11] are there you can verify yourself that
[43:13] these are real Bitcoin that they're
[43:14] actually there with very cheap
[43:17] technology and on the other hand with a
[43:20] network like lightning I mean lightning
[43:22] it's a few years old I think people um
[43:24] people really don't understand how
[43:27] disruptive lightning is people are like
[43:29] ah we need another layer too lightning
[43:31] has this and this tradeoff but just
[43:32] think about it Bitcoin was a revolution
[43:35] because For the first time in history we
[43:38] solved the problem how to actually keep
[43:42] the monetary units in a currency
[43:43] constant right 3,000 years ago the Greek
[43:46] philosophers knew and argued why the
[43:49] best money is one with a constant amount
[43:53] but until Satoshi Nakamoto nobody
[43:56] figured out a technological way to keep
[43:58] it at that the best technology was gold
[44:01] because they just it's hard to mine more
[44:03] gold that that was the
[44:05] solution and on top of this
[44:09] revolution we build lightning and
[44:10] lightning is the first payment system in
[44:13] the world that can actually verifiably
[44:17] transact for very low fees instantly a
[44:20] full Reserve money right with gold this
[44:22] was not possible if you if you had to
[44:24] transact instantly around the globe this
[44:26] was always like an IOU it is not
[44:29] possible to instantly transact
[44:32] gold and it's this is this is a whole
[44:36] additional layer on top because as I
[44:38] said just even if you send gold
[44:39] certificates around the world the the
[44:42] best way to do it is via
[44:45] lightning yeah
[44:48] Will for me I'm always really bullish on
[44:51] on the main layer and I'm always really
[44:52] like the main layer is is is is the most
[44:55] important and of course there will be
[44:57] the the scalabilities and more
[44:59] Technologies on top of that uh and
[45:01] there's so much going on uh with like
[45:04] lightning fent liquid Stacks that
[45:07] there's there's a lot of of Layer Two uh
[45:10] um solutions for in in the moment for me
[45:12] it's also like a lightning should be the
[45:15] the the one that that wins it's the one
[45:17] that most of of the people use will it
[45:20] be the the as you said the only one that
[45:24] will be on top of Bitcoin is there still
[45:27] like a a moment where it could be
[45:29] something else also I mean I think
[45:32] there's use cases for other layer twos
[45:36] or even layer three Technologies built
[45:38] upon uh
[45:39] lightning but I think for just payments
[45:42] actually transferring assets from A to B
[45:46] um lightning is just so mind-bogglingly
[45:49] revolutionary and good and I don't
[45:51] really see how to improve it because in
[45:52] the end layer one had very deliberate
[45:57] trade-offs and these trade-offs were to
[45:59] really make it the most solid foundation
[46:02] possible but lightning also maximizes
[46:06] tradeoffs it has different tradeoffs but
[46:08] it maximizes the tradeoffs to be the
[46:10] best payment Network possible so um if
[46:14] you want to have a better payment
[46:16] Network than lightning I don't think
[46:18] that's possible because in the end you
[46:20] have to either um have less security of
[46:24] actually having no uh fractional Reserve
[46:27] or you have to do another trade-off the
[46:29] world's not a not a fairy tale you you
[46:32] cannot just say I want to Max it all you
[46:34] always have to trade off and and Bitcoin
[46:36] maximizes really
[46:38] security uh of Bic the one thing Bitcoin
[46:42] maximizes is the security that you will
[46:44] always have this free uninflated base
[46:47] money that's the trade-off in in L1
[46:50] enlightening the trade-off is to have
[46:53] full Reserve keep that full Reserve
[46:55] that's that's anchored in in in in uh in
[46:58] in L1 with maximum achievable uh
[47:02] security and then make that as easily
[47:05] and cheaply transactable around the
[47:06] globe so every other layer to I think
[47:10] would need to take compromises for its
[47:12] use case but it would be a different use
[47:14] case if you try to just build a better
[47:17] lightning I I don't think that's
[47:19] possible right and and also I think it's
[47:20] nonsensical trying to build another
[47:22] lightning yeah you can do it but I think
[47:25] the best way is to just improve light
[47:28] definitely um let's switch a little bit
[47:31] of Gears I saw on your website uh dire
[47:35] warning to Real Estate Investors I did
[47:37] not uh read it I just saw it before the
[47:39] podcast uh but um I had a podcast I
[47:43] think a few weeks back where we talked
[47:46] about how Bitcoin will combat
[47:50] homelessness because it will drive down
[47:53] in the long run uh the home uh the the
[47:55] real estate prices is it about that like
[47:59] what should really part of the
[48:01] prediction has already turned out true
[48:03] right I mean in with
[48:05] regulation the the the Home Market in
[48:08] the EU and the Germany specifically is
[48:10] already dead right um I myself sold all
[48:14] my uh investing properties that I had I
[48:18] could have waited one or two years
[48:19] longer to really hit the top but I I saw
[48:22] it coming and and and it happened and
[48:25] right now I only own the house I live in
[48:28] and even that's not
[48:30] uh economically decision but rather a
[48:33] Sentimental one right
[48:35] um the long-term players that
[48:39] essentially real estate um is just
[48:45] purely monetized right real estate is
[48:48] the one where most of the contian effect
[48:50] goes because Banks retirement funds the
[48:53] one thing they can buy is real estate so
[48:55] um if 10 new monetary units are created
[48:59] I would say that probably eight or nine
[49:00] of them go into real
[49:03] estate but at the same time right
[49:05] population is aging um we will Top out
[49:09] likely in a decade or two if nothing
[49:11] changes in birth rates and then even
[49:12] decline in
[49:13] population so um real estate is really
[49:18] not a good case it's leverage to the
[49:20] hilt and um the very tight demand and
[49:25] Supply situation I think is also resing
[49:27] also I mean just generally there's so
[49:29] much open space and it's just
[49:32] artificially limited for example I I
[49:35] live near the Austin border near near
[49:37] salsburg and on the Austin side
[49:40] um outside of the core city of salsburg
[49:43] real estate prices are cheaper than on
[49:45] on the German side just because there
[49:47] it's easier to just buy buy a field and
[49:50] turn it into uh building land and here
[49:54] in in Bavaria they made it by law almost
[49:56] impossible to build outside of existing
[49:58] City uh or town
[50:00] boundaries so um a lot of this is just
[50:04] completely artificial inflation for
[50:05] example Munich one of the most expensive
[50:07] cities uh to live in in in in in Europe
[50:11] and definitely in Germany but that city
[50:13] has a lot of space you drive like half
[50:15] an hour outside and you're basically in
[50:17] the middle of nowhere where there's
[50:18] nothing so the city could easily grow
[50:21] easily it's just not allowed to by law
[50:24] but as soon as the pressure builds high
[50:26] enough and these law change immediately
[50:28] people can build and value of of the
[50:31] houses especially in the on the
[50:33] outskirts of town um will probably
[50:36] collapse yeah and the big part as you
[50:38] also mentioned is the monetary premium
[50:40] the like I think I don't know Germany
[50:42] it's also I think it's also in Germany
[50:44] like that but in Austria this mindset of
[50:48] I want to own my own house for
[50:50] retirement I want to own my house for
[50:53] investment stuff uh I think longterm
[50:56] people people will see uh oh it's better
[50:58] to have it actually in
[51:00] Bitcoin yeah I mean people don't like to
[51:04] monetize stuff right money has the
[51:07] strongest Network effects of all human
[51:09] tools it's really advantageous to have
[51:11] just one money so um besides of of
[51:15] course some kind of speculation like in
[51:17] founding a company or something um in a
[51:19] hard money standard there's very very
[51:22] little monetary premium to all other
[51:24] Goods besides the dominant money and if
[51:28] you think it through I mean what do you
[51:30] think an ounce of gold will be worth if
[51:32] it's really only used for like um de
[51:36] decorative purposes or industrial
[51:38] purposes likely uh you you'll get a kilo
[51:41] of of of gold for what now an ounce
[51:43] costs so the only question is will
[51:47] Bitcoin win out if yes then it will
[51:49] definitely
[51:51] demonetize uh the the monetary premiums
[51:54] of most other Goods maybe not completely
[51:57] but at least uh to 90 something
[52:00] per. yeah definitely um I'm always
[52:04] curious before we get to the end routine
[52:06] of our podcast what guests are currently
[52:08] studying like because we uh like most of
[52:12] my guests felt down the rabbit hole a
[52:15] few years back or like not that recently
[52:19] and at some point you going down
[52:21] different rabbit holes sometimes
[52:23] connected with Bitcoin sometimes don't
[52:24] connected at all with Bitcoin uh like
[52:27] what's the that's the current thing of
[52:29] you that you are now uh really
[52:31] passionate about right now studying
[52:33] about is it Bitcoin is it that but or is
[52:35] it something different I mean I'm of
[52:38] course passionate about building on
[52:39] bitcoin but really intellectually what
[52:41] I'm most going down is the oldest rabbit
[52:45] for me far before Bitcoin I was always
[52:48] interested in moral philosophy right how
[52:50] to structure a society are there
[52:53] objective morals what part of morals is
[52:55] objective or subjective
[52:57] and I'm I'm I'm really digging down into
[53:00] that right Bitcoin nation was one part
[53:01] of that but I really refrain from going
[53:03] too much into predicting how Society
[53:06] will look and right now for me I'm
[53:08] really going into thinking all this
[53:11] moral philosophy through um reading some
[53:14] of the old um Greek and Roman
[53:16] philosophers reading Hopper of course
[53:19] and and especially trying to figure out
[53:22] where are they wrong because it's very
[53:23] very difficult to talk about moral
[53:25] philosophy because
[53:27] the human default is to justify whatever
[53:30] you're doing right so your standard uh
[53:34] moral um ways you have this set of
[53:37] morals that were basically indoctrinated
[53:39] into you as a child and that you
[53:40] gathered yourself and that basically and
[53:43] also what you're doing even if you're a
[53:44] mass murderer you will justify you find
[53:46] a reason why why it was justified that
[53:47] you did that right so essentially moral
[53:51] reasoning by default is always I do X
[53:55] and I find uh arguments to justify X as
[53:59] good and I'm really trying
[54:03] to work around my own biases right and
[54:06] to to to see the biases of a rough B of
[54:09] a hopper and to try okay if I remove
[54:12] that bias that I see how does it change
[54:14] the whole uh framework of their
[54:17] argumentation yeah definitely it's
[54:20] that's that's something really really
[54:22] cool I like those kind of questions
[54:24] because um I think even as bitcoiners we
[54:27] should sometimes get out and uh learn
[54:30] something different that that's not
[54:32] about Bitcoin and uh we're having an end
[54:35] rtin in the podcast where the previous
[54:37] guest is asking a question for the next
[54:39] guest without knowing who the next guest
[54:41] actually is and your question from the
[54:44] previous guest
[54:45] is an interesting one uh I think it's
[54:48] it's it's not not that easy to to answer
[54:51] uh how much does it cost to produce a
[54:54] Bitcoin and is that actually important
[54:56] in in understanding Bitcoin enter prise
[54:59] I don't think it costs anything at all
[55:02] to reduce a Bitcoin because essentially
[55:04] um or rather the the cost that satosi
[55:06] would have put on his time to write the
[55:08] the white paper in version uh 1.0 of the
[55:12] code because basically at that time all
[55:15] the Bitcoins were there the the the
[55:17] question from my perspective is really
[55:18] what does it cost to acquire a
[55:21] Bitcoin and um that depends right how do
[55:24] we acquire it do we work for it do you
[55:26] mine it do you purchase it with Fiat
[55:28] money so I I I think it's it's um not
[55:33] yet an answerable question especially
[55:35] since I think Bitcoin is still too young
[55:37] and a lot too much is on on on exchanges
[55:41] where just paper Bitcoin um I think
[55:44] there's no market clearing price for
[55:46] Bitcoin yet right it's it's not found uh
[55:49] the market has not um honed in on on on
[55:53] on on the on the market price of Bitcoin
[55:56] yet
[55:57] really it was a pleasure talking with
[55:59] you Michael uh it was uh cool to have
[56:02] you and I like your St on bit naations I
[56:05] hope we get to that future
[56:07] honestly fut for I would love to see and
[56:11] yeah um uh before we let you off where
[56:14] can people ask you questions where can
[56:16] people reach you the best way to ask you
[56:18] questions I mean there there's my
[56:20] website Michael Anon fisher.com um and
[56:23] there's also a contact form I think and
[56:26] yeah um the the rest of the links I
[56:28] think I'll just give you for the show
[56:30] notes it's easier perfect but just my my
[56:33] name no spaces no dashes ata.com and you
[56:37] find
[56:38] me perfect then thank you for being on
[56:42] thank
[56:47] you
