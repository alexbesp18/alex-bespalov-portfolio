[00:00] people look for the shortcuts to making
[00:03] wealth people are always like when is
[00:04] the best time to trade oh yeah but like
[00:06] maybe this other coin that I heard about
[00:08] is also great and maybe I should buy
[00:10] that and then it's like you're not going
[00:11] to survive in Bitcoin or you're not
[00:13] going to make any money in Bitcoin
[00:15] unless you truly understand what you own
[00:18] you know there's no shortcuts you have
[00:19] to be willing to educate yourself you
[00:21] have to be willing to study it and put
[00:23] in the work something I truly own is
[00:25] incredibly rare but it does come with a
[00:27] lot of responsibility it does come with
[00:29] technical challenges not your keys not
[00:31] your coins I just hope that as we scale
[00:33] Bitcoin and as more people get onboarded
[00:35] it's done in the right way where people
[00:37] are able to take control of their keys
[00:39] whether that's through collaborative
[00:41] custody model or whatever it may be
[00:44] you're already kind of in the future but
[00:46] you're still stuck in in the traditional
[00:48] world and right now it's like how do you
[00:49] balance those two things and how do you
[00:52] make sure that you can successfully live
[00:54] in both but the real priority at least
[00:56] for me is how do I get that Bitcoin
[00:58] number to be higher at the end of the
[00:59] year
[01:00] [Music]
[01:04] here you had me actually on before on
[01:08] your show it's it's rare that someone
[01:09] has me on before and then I invite them
[01:12] back usually just add a rare round
[01:14] usually I'm the fast one in inviting
[01:16] people yeah I was going to say myself
[01:19] it's uh it's interesting sitting on the
[01:21] on the other side of the podcast this
[01:23] time so uh yeah excited to to dive into
[01:26] it and to be on your show really cool
[01:29] what I um just for people to to get to
[01:32] know like how
[01:33] many the podcast is recently started
[01:36] right how how did you go about that why
[01:39] did you start it and and how many
[01:41] episodes and stuff like that yeah so um
[01:44] I started the podcast or the the podcast
[01:46] really was an idea that came to me last
[01:48] year in April let's say um so I have a
[01:52] bit of a background with podcasting in
[01:54] general actually in about like 2019 20
[01:58] yeah it was 2019 or no actually 2018 I
[02:01] started a different podcast this was
[02:02] before I was a a bitcoiner but uh it was
[02:06] a podcast also an interv an
[02:07] interview-based podcast because I was
[02:09] very um Al say was actually pretty early
[02:11] into podcasting not as a podcaster
[02:13] myself but as a listener I remember very
[02:16] very early on being a huge fan of like
[02:18] the Tim ferah show and that's really
[02:20] what uh got me into the podcasting world
[02:22] and then in 2018 I started um my own
[02:25] show uh called the need to know podcast
[02:27] it's still actually on Spotify but that
[02:30] was more just like an interview podcast
[02:31] where I was interviewing people from a
[02:34] bunch of different disciplines and
[02:35] mainly just trying to distill you know
[02:36] what are the a bit in the form of Tim
[02:39] Ferris just talk about their habits
[02:40] routines mindsets of um of successful
[02:44] people and how they got to where where
[02:45] they have gotten and then in
[02:50] 20 I believe it was about 2022 I started
[02:53] a podcast uh called Bitcoin Blueprints
[02:56] and that's also still on but the idea of
[02:58] that one was to
[03:01] um just be an informational podcast so
[03:03] it was really just explaining like
[03:04] fundamental concepts of Bitcoin more
[03:06] from an educational standpoint so things
[03:09] like what is bitcoin why is it important
[03:12] what are Hardware wallets how do those
[03:14] work what is a lot of fundamental
[03:16] concepts in Bitcoin that are hard to
[03:18] understand I basically made a a series
[03:20] of episodes to distill those Concepts
[03:24] into 20 30 minute episodes and explain
[03:26] it to people um in an easy way and once
[03:28] I felt like I was kind of it was meant
[03:31] to be more of a series not not more so
[03:34] like an ongoing podcast and then in
[03:36] April um because I really wanted to
[03:39] continue podcasting and um I really
[03:41] wanted to talk with bitcoiners the idea
[03:44] of the Bitcoin Journeys podcast came
[03:46] about which is um what I'm doing now and
[03:49] my show is where I um yeah interview
[03:52] bitcoiners like yourself talk a bit
[03:53] about their Journey so how they got into
[03:55] the Bitcoin how they see their value
[03:57] proposition um and all of that and I
[03:59] think right now if I'm not mistaken I'm
[04:01] at about 22 is episodes trying to
[04:04] release one every week and um yeah it's
[04:06] been an incredible journey so far
[04:09] interesting I love that and and your
[04:12] Bitcoin Journeys is like having
[04:13] conversation but also discussing the the
[04:16] path that Bitcoin has go through what
[04:18] are the maybe some some of the patterns
[04:21] that you already saw when you talk with
[04:24] so many bitcoiners uh in their orange
[04:27] Bing Journeys in their Bitcoin Journey
[04:28] what kind of change their lives and uh
[04:31] what what you kind of conclude from that
[04:34] yeah I mean I'm sure like yourself I
[04:36] think one of the biggest things that or
[04:38] probably the biggest key that I see
[04:41] amongst all bitcoiners is there are
[04:43] incredibly smart people who have taken
[04:45] the time to fundamentally study Bitcoin
[04:49] understand what it is understand how it
[04:51] plays into the bigger picture and
[04:53] because I interview bitcoiners right and
[04:55] typically bitcoiners are people who are
[04:57] very convicted on bitcoin it is the
[05:00] future the value proposition and for
[05:03] everybody to get there I think education
[05:06] is such an important part and so that's
[05:09] one of the biggest things that I've
[05:10] noticed in interviewing these people is
[05:12] how incredibly smart they are not only
[05:14] about Bitcoin but about a variety of
[05:17] other topics whether that's economic
[05:19] history history in general technology
[05:22] and it's yeah it's incredibly inspiring
[05:25] because you you learn from them and we
[05:27] learn from each other and I think think
[05:29] the education Point has been such a such
[05:32] a huge thing and then another thing
[05:35] which I've really noticed as well is um
[05:38] critical thinking and being able to
[05:39] think on your own you know I think as
[05:41] bitcoiners especially now more and more
[05:44] it's getting mainstream but a lot of the
[05:46] people that I've had on my show have
[05:48] been bitcoiners who have been in the
[05:50] space for quite some time and so um
[05:53] before Bitcoin was where it is now and
[05:56] even now it's mainly not as mainstream
[05:59] as it will be eventually um it really
[06:01] requires you to think out of the box to
[06:03] think out of the traditional Financial
[06:06] system that we're in and how Bitcoin
[06:09] really works and you have to be able to
[06:11] apply critical thinking you have to be
[06:13] able to kind of step away from the herd
[06:15] really analyze how the system works and
[06:17] obviously I think books like the Bitcoin
[06:20] standard the Fiat standard uh broken
[06:23] money those are all really good books to
[06:25] help you kind of step out of the system
[06:27] but you do have to have that initial um
[06:30] character trade I think which is
[06:32] critical thinking and really being able
[06:34] to to step out of the box so yeah lots
[06:36] of Trades I could probably keep going on
[06:38] but I think those are are some of the
[06:40] main ones that I've I've noticed so far
[06:44] do do you think that's uh that has
[06:46] something to do with Bitcoin or is it
[06:47] just because we are early in a uh in a
[06:51] revolution I think a bit of both um I
[06:53] think you know in any Revolution you
[06:55] have early adopters and people who are
[06:57] able to see
[07:00] see the future a bit um you know I know
[07:02] we talk about Michael sailor a lot in
[07:03] the space but he's someone who's a prime
[07:05] example of that because not only has he
[07:08] been able to do it in Bitcoin but he's
[07:11] also able to do it earlier right he had
[07:13] the whole book on the mobile wave and
[07:15] predicting things like the the coming of
[07:17] Apple and Google and and Amazon and how
[07:19] big those companies would be um in the
[07:21] future and I think um it's part of being
[07:24] a bitcoiner but it's also part of being
[07:27] as you are you know you have people who
[07:28] are naturally um able to see emerging
[07:32] Technologies and I think also what's
[07:34] important is to be able to filter okay
[07:37] what's you know filter the signal from
[07:39] the noise what is actually something
[07:41] that will go towards the future and what
[07:43] is something that will probably over the
[07:45] course of the year whether it's a fad
[07:46] you know we've seen um in the past
[07:48] things in in even the crypto world that
[07:50] are are have really been more fads than
[07:52] actual things that are um sticking along
[07:54] and so um I think it's a bit of both I
[07:57] think it's a bit of Bitcoin is a unique
[07:59] case but also people inherently like
[08:02] Michael sailor who have that ability to
[08:04] really think critically and towards the
[08:06] future that that's really cool yeah it's
[08:09] also uh when you see all the things that
[08:12] that are happening in Bitcoin and when
[08:14] you see the people that are involved
[08:15] from Bitcoin it's it's kind of hard to
[08:17] not get excited about it it's like you
[08:19] see me so many smart people to work on
[08:22] basically one big project and this is
[08:24] kind of uh revolutionizing the whole
[08:28] financial space
[08:30] it really makes you extremely excited
[08:32] and bullish on on the future um what
[08:35] what is inside like as a Bitcoin podcast
[08:38] HS you you can probably relate to to
[08:40] that a lot there's a lot of topics
[08:42] inside of Bitcoin uh and it's so deep
[08:45] and and so proud already what is kind of
[08:48] the the thing that excites you the most
[08:50] within
[08:51] Bitcoin yeah it's a it's a very good
[08:53] question I think to be honest what's
[08:56] what's at the top of my mind right now
[08:58] is more from from a usability standpoint
[09:02] um because I think like the fundamental
[09:04] technology Bitcoin right it was um when
[09:07] Satoshi created it it was for the most
[09:09] part set in stone and you know how it
[09:11] works and the fundamental princip
[09:13] principles underlying it but I think
[09:16] where it's lacking right now is how do
[09:18] we make it more accessible to the masses
[09:21] and more usable to the masses because I
[09:23] know you know like myself like yourself
[09:26] like a lot of early bitcoiners you know
[09:27] we've gotten into it and we've taking
[09:29] the time to learn about things like
[09:31] Hardware wallets multi- signature
[09:33] custody uh collaborative custody all
[09:36] those things and they're great Solutions
[09:39] if you're technically um knowledgeable
[09:42] about those things and you know we have
[09:44] services like Casa Unchained you know I
[09:47] recently had a an interview with the
[09:49] founder of 21st Capital who who also do
[09:52] uh collaborative custody and so there's
[09:54] more and more solutions that are coming
[09:56] to the market that are making it more
[09:58] usable but what I really want to see is
[10:02] even beyond that
[10:03] because I struggle with it where it's
[10:06] like I like the idea as of collaborative
[10:09] custody as a bitcoiner but because I'm
[10:11] comfortable with the idea because I know
[10:13] how it works I still see that there's a
[10:15] big divide between myself and and my
[10:18] knowledge and the average person right
[10:20] and the idea is that we want to on board
[10:22] the next billion bitcoiners and so
[10:25] really what's top of mind is is thinking
[10:28] about how we're going to do that then
[10:29] you have things like I know fety mint um
[10:33] that that people are working on or um
[10:35] whether it be more easy to use Hardware
[10:38] wallets like for example I'm a big fan
[10:40] of of uh the big key uh Jack dorsy
[10:43] company who just came out with the
[10:44] really great Hardware wallet but really
[10:48] what I'm focused on and to to answer
[10:51] your question is how do we improve the
[10:53] usability of Bitcoin so that we can
[10:56] really scale it to the masses without
[10:58] everybody having an ETF and just having
[11:01] exposure to the price of Bitcoin but
[11:02] actually taking the self- custody aspect
[11:06] and making it applicable to you know as
[11:08] many people as possible absolutely yeah
[11:11] it it's like um you you you want to make
[11:16] it really accessible and uh I I was in
[11:20] Abu Dhabi and I interviewed on stage the
[11:23] um I forgot her name oh God that's so
[11:25] embarrassing I forget names too quick uh
[11:28] but I'm uh actually um uh interviewed
[11:31] someone from bit key on stage about bit
[11:34] key in Abu Dhabi uh and uh she just gave
[11:38] me a bit and I was like Hey like let me
[11:40] know what you think uh and I think it
[11:42] around with it a little bit and I was
[11:44] like that's a such a great solution
[11:46] especially for people that already are
[11:49] used to the iPhone and really easy to
[11:52] use things uh you just like do obviously
[11:56] it has its downsides and risk and
[11:58] disadvantage and
[11:59] Adventures uh I personally don't don't
[12:02] use it but I think for someone to have
[12:07] uh a multi signature Solutions with the
[12:10] Bitcoin with your with the the server
[12:12] key and the their phone key they have I
[12:15] think it's a really nice Solutions if
[12:16] you're getting starting in in Bitcoin
[12:18] before you keep it on Exchange just like
[12:21] keep keep it on an easy solution like
[12:22] that that that's that's really great I
[12:24] wouldn't park like 100 Bitcoin on there
[12:28] but uh maybe for for your first few
[12:31] hundred dollars in Bitcoin like why not
[12:33] or first thousands even yeah I mean I
[12:35] think because for
[12:37] me I I've so since I've been in Bitcoin
[12:41] I've been very luckily when I when I got
[12:43] into Bitcoin I was very quickly exposed
[12:46] to people like Andreas anthopoulos who
[12:48] you know really stress the emphasis of
[12:50] not your keys not your coins and so I've
[12:53] really been for the past 5 years
[12:55] experimenting with probably every single
[12:58] Hardware wallet there is and you know
[13:00] that's from single signature providers
[13:02] such as cold card you know Foundation
[13:05] you have obviously the popular ones in
[13:06] Ledger and treaser um two multi
[13:10] Solutions like Casa like Unchained like
[13:12] 21st Capital um but for
[13:16] me I like those Solutions but there's
[13:19] there was always something in the back
[13:20] of my mind where um even with the multi
[13:23] signatur Solutions you're still fully
[13:25] responsible for for anything that
[13:28] happens right right and luckily I
[13:29] haven't lost any Bitcoin um but still
[13:32] it's something that sometimes keeps me
[13:33] up at night I'm analyzing you know where
[13:35] are all my seed phrases where are my uh
[13:39] where am I keeping my wallets how do I
[13:41] make sure that it's dispersed in a way
[13:42] that's you know that there's no single
[13:44] points of failure and so it does take a
[13:46] lot of analyzing and a lot of brain work
[13:49] and a lot of diligence as well because
[13:51] it can be easy to mess something up and
[13:53] you know you know that when you have
[13:55] your funds on a hardware wallet and if
[13:57] you lose it you're you're screwed
[13:58] basically
[13:59] and so with the big key and this isn't
[14:02] an advertisement for Big key because I'm
[14:05] no way affiliated to them but I do
[14:07] recognize that they really filled a good
[14:10] hole in the market which is combining a
[14:13] hardware wallet that's super easy and
[14:15] intuitive to use with the iPhones
[14:17] interface and having a multi-
[14:20] signature um well solution as well
[14:23] wrapped into it and making it nearly
[14:26] impossible to to make a mistake now
[14:28] obviously there's downsides to it as
[14:30] well but that's kind of the conversation
[14:32] that I think we should have more and
[14:33] more is like Hardware wallets are great
[14:35] they're they're amazing to be able to
[14:37] take full um control and and
[14:40] responsibility of your keys but I think
[14:42] if we're being really brutally honest
[14:44] for a lot of people it's still very
[14:46] daunting and so people don't make that
[14:48] step to do it because they don't want to
[14:50] take that responsibility and so they end
[14:52] up leaving it on in exchanges anyways
[14:53] and then you're kind of back at square
[14:55] one so I'm not saying the big key is the
[14:58] end all be all but but I do think that
[15:00] there is a big market for finding ways
[15:03] to combine the ease of use of self-
[15:06] custody with uh or sorry combine the
[15:09] ease of use of having like your your
[15:11] Bitcoin on an exchange with the security
[15:14] and and the self- sovereignty of of
[15:16] self- custody I always tell people like
[15:21] people don't have self- custody uh we we
[15:23] live in a total bubble uh almost all of
[15:26] my guests have self- custody uh but
[15:29] funny enough if I ask my Bitcoin
[15:31] Community most of them actually say they
[15:33] don't have self custody when
[15:35] I when I see um in a conference and they
[15:39] ask on a main stage or who has self
[15:41] custody and there are like 8,000 people
[15:43] and like 20% lift the arms and like the
[15:47] rest of like I don't want to think of
[15:50] self custody I'm like oh like it's not
[15:52] it's not something that everyone does
[15:54] it's something that actually almost
[15:55] nobody does like self custody is
[15:57] something that uh most people shy away
[16:00] from um because of the stories because
[16:03] they trust uh uh an exchange more than
[16:06] themselves which
[16:07] is really sad um but but it it is a
[16:12] reality and I think it's it's not
[16:13] because uh people are stupid it's
[16:15] because we have to really develop those
[16:17] Technologies in a better way uh to make
[16:20] it really safe secure and easy uh so
[16:24] everyone understands what they're doing
[16:27] and we still have some some time to to
[16:30] to get there we still have some some
[16:32] developments and Technology techn
[16:35] technological advancements to get there
[16:38] yeah no I agree and and that's the thing
[16:41] I think sometimes as bitcoiners we
[16:43] especially people who have been in the
[16:44] space for a while we assume that a lot
[16:47] of people are you know self cussing
[16:49] their Bitcoin but I think there's more
[16:51] people than you would imagine that like
[16:53] you said you know you could be at a when
[16:54] you you're your example of when you at
[16:55] the conference um it's still far away
[16:58] and I think the thing that we want to
[17:00] avoid with Bitcoin is where we end up
[17:02] again in this cycle of people not really
[17:05] owning their Bitcoin and then you get
[17:06] this rehypothecation scheme where then
[17:08] the people who do actually have custody
[17:10] of the Bitcoin end up reh hypothecating
[17:12] it and lending it out and then you have
[17:14] crashes like we saw obviously with FTX
[17:17] where an exchange just goes belly up and
[17:19] so um yeah it's it's really important
[17:23] and I try to emphasize it to to all my
[17:25] friends and family who get into Bitcoin
[17:26] as well as like truly self- custody is a
[17:29] gift being able to just take your
[17:32] Bitcoin and take ownership of it and say
[17:34] look there's nobody who can tell me what
[17:36] to do with this like it's mine there's
[17:37] nobody that's going to say you can spend
[17:39] that you can't spend that um it's
[17:41] something I truly own is incredibly rare
[17:44] but it does come with a lot of
[17:46] responsibility it does come with
[17:47] technical challenges and so I think
[17:50] obviously we're still in the very early
[17:51] days of Bitcoin you know I think um same
[17:54] thing with the internet when it was
[17:56] first started you know there was a lot
[17:57] of people who were spinning up their own
[18:00] um servers and modems and everything and
[18:03] and so obviously the technology advances
[18:05] to a point where it becomes more usable
[18:07] as it scales to the masses I just hope
[18:10] that as we scale Bitcoin and as more
[18:12] people get onboard it it's done in the
[18:14] right way where people are able to take
[18:17] control of their keys whether that's
[18:19] through collaborative custody model or
[18:22] whatever it may be um while still you
[18:26] know being able to uh profit from
[18:29] Bitcoin and and hold it and and and yeah
[18:32] cherish in it and and so I think it'll
[18:35] be something that we'll see I think
[18:36] develop over the coming years also as we
[18:38] see more things get adopted in terms of
[18:41] like payment mechanisms and the
[18:43] lightning Network and um because right
[18:45] now also bit Bitcoin is not very
[18:48] spendable obviously there's tax
[18:50] implications that come along with that
[18:51] as well but it's still a clunky
[18:53] infrastructure and I think that's why
[18:55] it's something that I'm you know on top
[18:57] of my mind especially as someone who
[18:59] lives a majority on a Bitcoin standard
[19:02] you you start to think about it more
[19:03] because it starts to become more and
[19:05] more practical in your dayto day right
[19:07] is is that the the thing that that kind
[19:09] of holds B Bitcoin still back from like
[19:12] Mass adoption yeah yes and no I
[19:16] think no because I think right now the
[19:19] pro the the thing with Bitcoin is we're
[19:21] in we're in more the monetization phase
[19:24] where even though there are people who
[19:25] live on a Bitcoin standard typically
[19:27] people don't want to spend Bitcoin
[19:29] because they know the value of it and
[19:32] what it will be going forward which is
[19:34] good because it allows you to live a bit
[19:35] more you know fiscally responsible or in
[19:38] safed in's you know words have a higher
[19:40] time preference because it's something
[19:42] that you don't want to spend so you
[19:43] really think about okay um do I want to
[19:46] buy this or is it like is it a want or
[19:48] is it a need um so I think in terms of
[19:51] long-term adoption usability right now
[19:53] is maybe not as relevant because people
[19:56] typically just want to buy and hold
[19:57] Bitcoin they don't really
[19:59] right now use it as much in day-to-day
[20:01] transactions um but I think as we scale
[20:04] and as Bitcoin gets to a point where
[20:06] maybe it goes higher and higher in the
[20:08] monetization phase and it does get to
[20:10] become more and more stable that will be
[20:12] a big issue but right now I think the
[20:14] biggest thing in terms of adoption and
[20:17] that's why I think your podcast is so
[20:19] important my podcast is so important all
[20:21] Bitcoin podcasts are so important is
[20:24] education people still fundamentally a
[20:26] lot of people still don't understand
[20:27] what Bitcoin is and why it's important
[20:29] so I think education is probably the
[20:31] biggest uh stumbling block towards
[20:33] adoption right now and then I think
[20:36] usability is something that is close
[20:38] second I partnered up with coin
[20:41] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[20:44] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[20:46] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[20:49] love it so much coin vigilante made and
[20:52] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[20:55] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[20:58] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[21:01] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[21:04] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[21:07] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[21:10] watch collections you have the date of
[21:13] the first ever Mind Bitcoin Block in
[21:16] there and of course also the block
[21:18] height and which EPO we are currently in
[21:22] I love the level of detail they put in
[21:24] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[21:27] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[21:30] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[21:32] love those watches so so much if you
[21:36] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[21:38] regular basis I'll guess you already
[21:40] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[21:42] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[21:46] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[21:48] personal recommendation for Hardware
[21:50] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[21:53] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[21:55] gift for a friend who has still their
[21:57] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[22:00] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[22:03] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss SL
[22:07] robobin to get your bitbox and the next
[22:10] step is to really level up your
[22:12] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[22:14] have the most secure self custody setup
[22:17] you have to secure your own devices you
[22:20] have to protect your privacy you have to
[22:23] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[22:26] on where you live you even want to have
[22:28] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[22:31] move in case something goes really
[22:33] really wrong and through all those steps
[22:35] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[22:37] step by step and if you visit the
[22:40] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[22:44] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[22:47] out how you can level up your
[22:49] sovereignty I often think about what
[22:51] drives what what is the main thing that
[22:54] drives Bitcoin adoption and I still feel
[22:56] like it's a price like it's feel like
[22:59] the price is is is not the lagging
[23:03] indicator on the consequence of adoption
[23:05] it's more of the uh the the cause almost
[23:09] of adoption like people uh adopting it
[23:12] the price goes up that brings more
[23:13] people in which forces more adoption uh
[23:16] which brings more people in which brings
[23:18] more adoption which brings more
[23:20] developments More Money More companies
[23:22] that develop stuff and all those things
[23:24] like a uh like in an upward cycle so I I
[23:29] do feel like prize is the one the the
[23:32] major marketing aspect that drives or
[23:36] all the all the things and the the
[23:39] YouTube channels the education are
[23:42] Downstream from that I guess yeah no
[23:46] definitely because I mean we also notice
[23:47] it in in the Cycles right like now we're
[23:51] entering another Bull Run or we are in
[23:53] another Bull Run and obviously all
[23:56] attention for Bitcoin is up as well well
[23:59] um you know I firsthand experienced this
[24:00] as well um in in the last cycle because
[24:04] I actually worked
[24:06] for um for for strike for a bit um Jack
[24:10] Muller's company in the last before the
[24:12] last bare Market um and obviously at the
[24:15] time you know um the company was hiring
[24:17] a lot of people um and in the downturn
[24:21] yeah um the companies are affected
[24:23] people are have to be let go and it's
[24:26] the same thing in media you know like
[24:28] big coin at at least right now it's very
[24:30] cyclical so when it's good it's good and
[24:32] when it's bad it can be very bad so um I
[24:36] think hopefully we'll start to see a bit
[24:39] I think diminishing effects of those
[24:42] Cycles like I think in terms of
[24:44] volatility as Bitcoin becomes more and
[24:46] more like a main stay of the financial
[24:49] system um but right now like you said it
[24:51] is very cyclical it is very um when
[24:54] people when the price runs up it's the
[24:56] biggest marketing thing there is because
[24:58] then people get interested it people
[24:59] want to buy it but as soon as there is a
[25:02] a crash as soon as the Bitcoin price
[25:03] goes down and especially as we
[25:05] experienced and in the last Market you
[25:07] know I was I I think 20 the Bull Run of
[25:11] 2019 2020 2021 was my first true Bull
[25:15] Run and I remember you know at the time
[25:18] um at the heights of the bull run people
[25:20] were saying you know it's going up to
[25:22] 300 400k even and U you know I think we
[25:26] hadit a high of about 69k and then crash
[25:28] down to the into the teens again and
[25:31] yeah it's crazy right you you go from
[25:34] this Euphoria of thinking that you can
[25:38] you're about to be Filthy Rich so to
[25:41] speak to then you know being back almost
[25:44] lower to where you were in the previous
[25:46] cycle so Bitcoin has a beautiful way of
[25:49] of humbling you of really making sure
[25:52] that you have conviction and that you
[25:53] understand what it is that you're
[25:55] holding um but yeah right like you said
[25:58] right now it is very cyclical
[25:59] unfortunately um but I hope that over
[26:02] time it becomes less and less cyclical
[26:04] and it becomes more a part of just
[26:07] mainstream Financial
[26:10] system do do you think volatility
[26:12] actually goes down like I I I have a
[26:14] hard time believing a hard time
[26:16] believing that for some reason I don't
[26:18] know it's so hard to predict anything um
[26:21] with Bitcoin I hope I hope it does um I
[26:24] don't think it will be in the next few
[26:26] years that volatility goes down I do
[26:29] hope that um volatility decreases like I
[26:33] don't I think it'll still be Peaks and
[26:36] valleys but I hope that the draw Downs
[26:38] won't be 80% draw Downs I hope maybe
[26:41] they'll be 30 40% which is still quite
[26:44] significant if you're just thinking of
[26:45] financial assets but I think volatility
[26:49] will remain um a part of Bitcoin and I
[26:52] do think it's a feature not a bug at the
[26:54] moment until it becomes really globally
[26:57] adopted and at that point I think the
[26:59] monetization will be so high and it'll
[27:01] be so stable that um you know I think I
[27:05] think it's Preston pish who also has
[27:07] this theory that once Bitcoin
[27:09] essentially is fully monetized we'll see
[27:11] Bitcoin being reallocated into other
[27:13] assets like real estate the stock market
[27:15] again but priced at a reasonable level
[27:17] and not you know where things are today
[27:19] but I don't think we'll see that
[27:22] happening who knows right but I don't
[27:24] think we'll see that happening anytime
[27:26] soon I I I I just uh want to pull that
[27:30] up if I find it um and that's that's
[27:34] like oh I found it actually
[27:36] wow I'm amazed that I actually found it
[27:40] because usually I don't find those those
[27:41] charts I'm getting more better in in
[27:43] being my own Jamie I was gonna say that
[27:47] that pulls pulls things up while still
[27:50] being the host um because I think
[27:54] Bitcoin is going to be adopted really
[27:57] crazy and the the steepest curve of the
[27:59] adoption I think in Bitcoin is still in
[28:01] front of us and I'm really curious on on
[28:04] what you think about that um and when
[28:06] you compare that now uh uh the gold
[28:11] price in
[28:12] V marks uh and the percentage change in
[28:16] the gold price uh in that case I think
[28:20] gold price will be Bitcoin and viar will
[28:23] be like the strongest field currencies
[28:25] and all others will be even worse than
[28:27] that uh and uh I think the adoption
[28:30] curve probably looks more like that uh
[28:34] and and less diminishing like people are
[28:37] thinking like oh like we every year now
[28:39] a little bit less uh di less returns of
[28:42] Bitcoin still really strong and
[28:44] volatility also a little bit less uh I
[28:47] get that but I I that's why I asked like
[28:51] I have a hard time believing the the uh
[28:54] lower volatility because of a hard time
[28:57] believing the lower diminishing returns
[28:59] like the diminishing returns Theory uh
[29:02] and and I think uh Bitcoin adoption will
[29:05] more look like something like that for
[29:07] for the people that that only listen now
[29:09] is that's a it's a chart where the gold
[29:11] price is in why my marks uh from 1914 to
[29:17] 1924 uh on on the screen and it
[29:20] basically shows uh uh a very flat curve
[29:24] and then to the end it goes really high
[29:26] up and the higher goes up the higher the
[29:29] volatility and that's why I think we are
[29:31] probably somewhere here between 19170
[29:34] and 1920 and I think the volatility and
[29:37] the returns actually will will increase
[29:40] but I could be wrong I'm just like
[29:42] Curious uh on on on what you think
[29:45] around that theory yeah well what's
[29:48] interesting about this chart as well is
[29:50] I think um you can yeah because this
[29:52] start gets pulled up a lot in Bitcoin I
[29:54] think it's a fascinating one but I think
[29:56] what's what's interesting also to point
[29:58] went out here is like the the black line
[30:00] representing the um the gold price and
[30:04] Yar marks right and obviously the Yar
[30:07] Mark um hyperinflated and so if you
[30:10] actually just look at the the black line
[30:14] um it's yeah I think it's something like
[30:16] we could probably expect to see in
[30:17] Bitcoin but then when you look at the
[30:20] the red line it the volatility aspect is
[30:23] is crazy but that's not necessarily
[30:25] because the volatility of gold is cra
[30:28] crazy it's because the Yar the Yar Mark
[30:31] is getting hyperinflated and so I think
[30:34] part of that also depends on you know
[30:36] what the strongest currencies in the
[30:38] world will do um obviously if things
[30:41] like the US dollar enter hyperinflation
[30:43] will definitely see this as well um but
[30:46] I think that the important thing here is
[30:48] just like holding something that is um
[30:52] sound sound money and obviously we've
[30:54] you know in the bitcoiners we believe
[30:56] that Bitcoin is digital gold it's better
[30:59] than gold um and so I agree I think
[31:02] volatility will continue to to be a
[31:06] thing but I think um what's also
[31:08] fascinating and some of the bitcoiners
[31:10] that I've talked to is like what is your
[31:12] unit of account like because if you're
[31:13] unit of account as Bitcoin you know it
[31:16] it can be pretty stable you own the same
[31:18] amount of Bitcoin It's usually the other
[31:20] side of the coin that's very volatile
[31:22] it's a dollar amount that's you know
[31:24] going up and down and so um so yeah I
[31:28] think as a bitcoiner what I try to do is
[31:29] I try to focus more on the Bitcoin I
[31:31] have and making sure that number goes up
[31:34] um and less focus a bit on the the fiat
[31:37] currency part of part of the things if
[31:39] that makes sense that is an
[31:43] amazing uh thing though because I only
[31:46] looked from like Bitcoin versus feat but
[31:49] in the in terms of hyp Bitcoin isation
[31:54] um you also have to have a third metric
[31:57] of third variable of that's maybe called
[32:00] purchasing power uh and the volatility
[32:05] of Bitcoin will go down in terms of
[32:09] purchasing power I think uh but will go
[32:12] up in terms of volatility measured in
[32:15] Fiat currencies if they get
[32:17] hyperinflated uh and if if the world
[32:19] actually goes towards Bitcoin that
[32:21] that's super interesting I'm I'm
[32:23] currently working like on a on a theory
[32:25] on a conclusion of of all the podcasts
[32:28] working on like okay how will this hyper
[32:29] bit conization also look like and that's
[32:31] like one part of of what I'm currently
[32:34] working on in my book um uh and and
[32:37] that's something I'm really interested
[32:39] in and that's a really good point of
[32:40] like um looking volatility and
[32:43] diminishing returns from two perspective
[32:45] the one perspective is um the the aspect
[32:50] of measuring it in a fiat currency
[32:53] probably in the most dominant one it
[32:54] makes sense to measure it in the US
[32:56] dollar even though I'm uh living in the
[32:58] Euro uh and another f is
[33:01] like measure bitcoin's growth maybe in
[33:04] Gold that to to get more of the adoption
[33:07] less of the uh uh of of the uh of the uh
[33:14] volatility of the fiat currency so I
[33:17] think gold might be an interesting
[33:19] comparison that could be interesting as
[33:21] well I think um for me to be honest the
[33:24] way that I view it is like um the the
[33:27] Fiat side of things will will fluctuate
[33:30] up and down a lot but a lot of times
[33:33] that Fiat fluctuation is not really
[33:34] reflective of bitcoin's value you know
[33:36] we all know that Bitcoin should be
[33:38] priced probably much higher than where
[33:40] it is right now but because there's so
[33:42] many other things that are going on in
[33:44] the world and so many other things
[33:46] related to you know Fiat that we don't
[33:48] control if it goes up and down a lot you
[33:51] know things like the Federal Reserve and
[33:52] the interest rates that they put that
[33:54] has a a huge effect on on the price of
[33:58] Assets in general but Bitcoin
[34:00] specifically and so um really my mindset
[34:03] is like as a bitcoiners like what I want
[34:05] to focus on is like how do I just get
[34:07] that Bitcoin number to be higher and
[34:11] yeah we still live in a Fiat denominated
[34:13] world right you're not buying your
[34:14] groceries priced in Bitcoin
[34:16] unfortunately you're buying your
[34:17] groceries priced in euros or dollars and
[34:19] so you still have to live in in the Fiat
[34:21] world but I think it's that's the
[34:23] Paradox right now is like balancing like
[34:26] um there's there's this like this really
[34:29] cool picture that um that I like it's
[34:31] like basically an astronaut in a space
[34:33] suit sitting like in a forest and I feel
[34:35] like that's how it sometimes is like as
[34:37] a bitcoiner it's like you're already
[34:38] kind of in the future but you're still
[34:40] stuck in in the traditional world and
[34:43] right now it's like how do you balance
[34:45] those two things and how do you make
[34:47] sure that you can successfully live in
[34:50] both but the real priority at least for
[34:52] me is how do I get that Bitcoin number
[34:54] to be higher at the end of the
[34:56] year that that's a crazy crazy crazy
[35:00] thing to to look at yeah like the
[35:01] getting the Bitcoin number higher it's
[35:03] also something that I actually do now
[35:05] with uh uh with my business of like okay
[35:08] how many dollars uh did I make in the
[35:10] year like I make it in Euros uh and how
[35:13] many Bitcoin did I make uh and it would
[35:17] be probably really easy to hit the Euro
[35:19] Mark again uh or like double that even
[35:23] maybe but can I also increase my my
[35:26] Bitcoin income that that will be the the
[35:29] fun question to to ask at the end of the
[35:32] end of the year really interesting so I
[35:34] just pulled up the a bitcoin price in
[35:38] ounces and in grams of gold I don't know
[35:41] why there's uh some some difference uh
[35:44] they they they swing differently I have
[35:47] I I don't have enough knowledge about
[35:49] the gold price why there's a different
[35:51] price of of gold and and in ANS and GRS
[35:55] um but it's definitely interesting to
[35:57] see that Bitcoin is way more stable here
[36:02] it's it kind of it feels not as volatile
[36:06] in in in gold and way more like uh
[36:09] smooth sailing um from from here and
[36:13] less volatile so if if we compare that
[36:16] to the previous chart and or maybe like
[36:18] this is from 2010 to 1995 if you go now
[36:22] to bitcoin and US dollar and you zoom
[36:25] out in the max this looks whole lot
[36:28] different uh and this is not even from
[36:30] the starting so uh it it it looks
[36:34] completely different from uh this one it
[36:38] it gets more and more flat actually uh
[36:42] because the feat volatility and the Fe
[36:44] devaluation is not out of the picture
[36:46] that that's super interesting I never
[36:47] thought about that actually yeah yeah
[36:50] exactly it's it's super important what
[36:52] you're measuring Bitcoin against because
[36:54] yeah if you're measuring it against the
[36:56] FI currency that's
[36:58] um and and that's why we also see huge
[37:00] variations in which fiat currency you're
[37:02] measuring it against right if you look
[37:03] at the chart of like okay Bitcoin US
[37:06] dollar it looks something like that but
[37:08] maybe now do like the Argentinian peso
[37:10] it could it's probably a completely
[37:12] different chart right um if you zoom out
[37:15] to the max it's like yeah it's
[37:16] hyperbolic so that's the thing like it's
[37:19] it's all about what you measure Bitcoin
[37:21] against and that's why I think people
[37:23] should be focused
[37:25] on increasing the amount of Bitcoin that
[37:28] they have and worry less about the noise
[37:30] about the price especially and that's
[37:31] what I tell all my friends and family as
[37:33] well is like look if you're trying to
[37:35] trade Bitcoin good luck it could swing a
[37:37] million different ways I wish you all
[37:39] the best but my advice is like hold it
[37:43] have a longtime Horizon and study it and
[37:46] then you'll be at peace because yeah
[37:47] it's very volatile but I don't think
[37:49] it's volatile because Bitcoin is
[37:51] inherently volatile I think it's
[37:53] volatile because we live in a Fiat world
[37:56] that is volatile it's super interesting
[37:58] because my mom my mom is so sweet she
[38:01] always comes to me and says like if if
[38:03] you know a really good time to buy
[38:05] Bitcoin like like I know every time is a
[38:08] good time but if you know like now is a
[38:09] really good time like tell me and I'm
[38:12] like every time is a really good time
[38:14] for Bitcoin like I I really don't know
[38:17] uh and and there there's actually many
[38:20] uh friends and family members that they
[38:22] come to me as like hey Robin like if
[38:24] like as if I have some inside
[38:27] information like um they still think of
[38:30] Bitcoin of like there's like a community
[38:33] and the people inside of the community
[38:35] have inside information the same way as
[38:37] people might have inside information of
[38:39] a company but it is not like I have the
[38:44] same information of Bitcoin as anyone
[38:47] else like I I don't like have special
[38:51] access to the blockchain have like some
[38:53] special metrics that nobody else sees uh
[38:56] obviously
[38:58] uh so that the this thing of like people
[39:02] coming in like oh like what is the best
[39:04] time to buy Bitcoin and then I always
[39:06] tell them the same story I like there
[39:08] are three things that I think will
[39:10] happen now either Bitcoin crashes down
[39:12] it stays the same or maybe or maybe it
[39:14] really goes up now and I'm like those
[39:17] those
[39:18] three those three things are very likely
[39:21] that happens right now in the next 12
[39:24] months and then they're like okay let's
[39:25] let's let's see what happens yeah I mean
[39:28] that that's the thing though right is
[39:29] like exactly like you said like I have
[39:31] no idea where Bing goes in the next few
[39:33] months the consensus right now is
[39:36] hopefully up and to the right but it
[39:37] could also go down into the right into
[39:39] the left you never know what Bitcoin um
[39:42] and that's why I think coming back on
[39:44] this education piece it's so important
[39:46] like people people look for the shortcut
[39:49] right people are always like oh yeah uh
[39:52] when is the best time to trade oh yeah
[39:54] but like maybe this other coin that I
[39:56] heard about is also great and maybe I
[39:58] should buy that and then it's like
[40:00] people look for the shortcut to making
[40:03] wealth but I think and that's why I'm
[40:05] also a big fan of of people like um well
[40:09] despite their opinions on on um on
[40:11] bitcoin you know people like late
[40:13] Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett um
[40:17] they their fundamental investing
[40:19] principles are are solid and they're
[40:21] guys who basically they have this thing
[40:24] it's like they're incredibly
[40:25] knowledgeable about what they invest in
[40:28] like they study their companies that
[40:29] they invest in like to the te they're
[40:32] also knowledgeable about the World At
[40:34] Large but then they also have the
[40:35] ability to just sit on their hands and
[40:37] when the whole world is going crazy and
[40:39] people are trading up and down they know
[40:41] the fundamental value of the companies
[40:42] that they own and they just have the
[40:44] ability to PE patient and and um out
[40:47] stick the market and I think it's a
[40:49] great principle for Bitcoin as well
[40:51] because you're not going to survive in
[40:53] Bitcoin or you're not going to make any
[40:55] money in Bitcoin unless you truly
[40:57] understand what you own you know there's
[40:59] no shortcuts and you may get lucky in
[41:01] the short term and step in at a good
[41:03] time and Bitcoin rips 30% to the upside
[41:05] but you know like we just saw it went up
[41:07] to 110k now it's at
[41:10] 95k if you don't know what you own you
[41:12] might already sell and and you know cut
[41:14] your losses or take the profit that you
[41:15] have but we all know how valuable
[41:18] Bitcoin is we all know over the long
[41:21] term where it's going to go but you have
[41:23] to be willing to educate yourself you
[41:25] have to be willing to study it and put
[41:26] in the work
[41:28] and um yeah that's why I think Bitcoin
[41:30] is still priced where it is right now is
[41:32] because most people haven't done that
[41:33] and most people truly still don't
[41:35] understand what it is or why it's
[41:37] important and and I also love uh the
[41:42] aspect of measuring Bitcoin and gold uh
[41:45] because it we because this puts the
[41:50] devaluation of the field currencies out
[41:52] of the equation and we are just really
[41:55] focusing on the devaluation of gold a
[41:59] little bit uh like obviously uh gold
[42:02] also gets devalued by Bitcoin but at a
[42:05] very slow rate uh and the most part of
[42:09] of that chart is then just the adoption
[42:11] rate of Bitcoin uh and and nothing else
[42:14] and then we can really measure of how
[42:17] how much bigger Bitcoin got
[42:19] so that that's that's probably a way
[42:22] better to way to to think of uh the the
[42:25] Bitcoin adoption rate uh compared in in
[42:28] Gold do do you have a date of like when
[42:31] you expect Bitcoin to flip gold like
[42:33] that's the that's I think the biggest
[42:35] event that will happen in ter terms of
[42:38] Bitcoin adoption
[42:39] Milestones yeah
[42:42] um a day that's it's difficult I think
[42:45] people are calling it for for this cycle
[42:47] I mean the thing is like it's also
[42:49] dependent on what happens globally you
[42:52] know I know obviously now especially uh
[42:55] in the past few months there's been more
[42:57] talk about Bitcoin on a political
[42:59] geopolitical scale as well so the thing
[43:02] is when you have a finite scarce asset
[43:06] going up against infinite Fiat money um
[43:10] yeah it could run up really high
[43:11] depending on what the circumstances are
[43:13] so the gold scenario I believe right now
[43:16] to flip gold we need to be at like 800k
[43:19] or something um which yeah is about a 8X
[43:22] from where we are now right which seems
[43:25] crazy but with Bitcoin is like say
[43:28] tomorrow because I know the US has you
[43:31] know come for and talk about like their
[43:33] digital assets policy and things like
[43:35] that but let's say they actually make a
[43:37] meaningful move and do the Bitcoin
[43:39] strategic reserve and start adopting
[43:42] Bitcoin and actually stacking Bitcoin
[43:44] and you see countries like China and
[43:46] Russia doing the same and then the rest
[43:48] of the world kind of follow suit it
[43:50] could happen this cycle I mean I'm not
[43:52] saying that it will but I'm saying it's
[43:54] possible so um maybe this this cycle but
[43:59] Pro realistically probably I would say
[44:01] in the next yeah four to five years
[44:03] absolutely add it's that that that that
[44:06] could happen um really cool uh the the
[44:10] one thing I'm I'm curious also always
[44:12] with if people are like how uh not not
[44:17] how why they they got into Bitcoin but
[44:20] uh why they now so excited about Bitcoin
[44:23] that they even work in inside of it
[44:25] especially with you uh you not only
[44:28] decided to dedicate your financial
[44:31] energy into Bitcoin which is once you
[44:34] studied an easy step because you're like
[44:36] that's the place I benefit the most and
[44:39] I have to put my financial energy
[44:41] somewhere but like working in Bitcoin is
[44:44] a whole different
[44:46] level
[44:48] because I think bitcoiners could make
[44:51] way more money in the fat world with the
[44:53] same skills I think
[44:55] Bitcoin uh e system is still pretty
[44:59] early uh so so making money there is
[45:03] harder uh uh and not as easy as as the
[45:08] the money flows in the field system um
[45:12] that's why I'm always really interested
[45:14] in why someone is doing a Bitcoin
[45:18] podcast or a company in Bitcoin or some
[45:21] Venture in Bitcoin or project in Bitcoin
[45:24] uh like why are you also allocating your
[45:27] life's energy like your time in into
[45:30] Bitcoin yeah I mean I think Bitcoin is
[45:34] the the most important thing that we can
[45:38] can work on right now and that's why I
[45:39] think you know I put my financial energy
[45:41] in there but I think there's nothing
[45:43] else that gets me as excited to work on
[45:47] as Bitcoin you know doing these podcasts
[45:49] after every podcast that I do I'm always
[45:52] super energized because the people I
[45:53] talk with are just incredible and so um
[45:57] I do it because I genuinely love it and
[45:59] because it's something that I'm I'm
[46:01] passionate about and you know I think I
[46:03] I struggled for a while kind of you know
[46:07] finding my my quote unquote passion and
[46:09] I've always been you know a very active
[46:11] guy and I've Loved Sports and um you
[46:14] know competing in in sports and and
[46:16] triathlons and things like that and um
[46:19] but I I've never been to a point where I
[46:20] could be a professional athlete and then
[46:23] when I discovered Bitcoin um I was able
[46:26] to to almost like have that same
[46:28] enthusiasm for something um but then be
[46:31] able to apply it also in a business
[46:33] sense and so um for me when I discovered
[46:35] Bitcoin it just got me so excited
[46:37] because it was a technology that I think
[46:40] fundamentally fixes the world you know
[46:42] they say fix the money fix the world and
[46:44] so um for me it's it's not even as much
[46:47] about the financial aspect of it anymore
[46:49] it's about truly seeing um the societal
[46:53] benefits that flow from mainstream
[46:55] Bitcoin adoption people living on a
[46:57] Bitcoin standard and Country shifting to
[46:59] a Bitcoin standard and so I think it's
[47:02] one of the most important and Noble
[47:05] causes that that we can work towards and
[47:07] so I think that's a bit what life is
[47:09] about right it's also about working
[47:11] towards something that you believe in
[47:12] working towards something that you're
[47:14] proud of and for me that's Bitcoin to
[47:17] the
[47:17] tea yeah it's also the bringing the
[47:21] ethics and the good things back to money
[47:24] and uh what what good that can can bring
[47:27] to to the world it's it's almost a
[47:32] charitable work and and it's super
[47:34] interesting um I I rarely talk about
[47:36] that on the podcast but Bitcoin is kind
[47:39] of the first Revolution that if you're
[47:41] working in the revolution um you are
[47:44] massively rewarded financially like
[47:47] usually in a revolution you are hunted
[47:50] and you are uh um financially banned and
[47:55] financially uh devastated but Bitcoin is
[47:57] kind of the opposite of that like you
[48:00] gain Financial
[48:02] power um by and participating in this
[48:07] revolution because in the end of the day
[48:10] if if Bitcoin is actually successful we
[48:13] will turn over central banks and the
[48:16] elites of the world in banking like that
[48:18] that's a huge thing it's like uh the
[48:20] French Revolution it's like other
[48:22] revolutions where a smaller group of
[48:24] people are starting to revolute against
[48:29] the big Elites the big uh overpowers and
[48:33] that's that's usually not rewarded
[48:36] financially yeah yeah it's it's true and
[48:39] I think um that's one of the unique
[48:41] things about Bitcoin as well it's you
[48:43] know life is all about incentives and I
[48:46] think obviously a beautiful incentive
[48:48] about Bitcoin is like um and I think I
[48:51] believe Alex cladin also talks about
[48:53] this a lot because he works obviously
[48:54] with uh um the human rights foundation
[48:57] and so he deals with a lot of you know
[49:00] um oppressive regimes and and and things
[49:02] like that and I think one of the things
[49:04] that's beautiful about Bitcoin is like
[49:05] the incentives are there where it's like
[49:08] you're you can be incentivized from like
[49:10] a Goodwill perspective to advocate for
[49:14] Bitcoin to advocate for um all of the
[49:17] fundamental benefits that it that it
[49:19] purveys to society but you also get
[49:22] financially rewarded because if Bitcoin
[49:24] gets adopted if Bitcoin goes up up in
[49:27] value you also I assume if you own
[49:30] Bitcoin you also then um you know get a
[49:33] part of that and so that's why I think
[49:34] it's also exciting to to work in in
[49:37] Bitcoin is because you know you can it's
[49:39] something you can be unpassionate about
[49:41] for what it represents you know and the
[49:43] fundamental ability that it has to
[49:45] really shape Society for the better but
[49:48] Bitcoin success is also my success
[49:50] because I'm pretty much all in on
[49:52] bitcoin if Bitcoin does well I do well
[49:54] so that's what's one of the beautiful
[49:57] things about Bitcoin is it really
[49:58] combines these incentive systems and
[50:01] that's why I I think like as it gains an
[50:04] adoption and we see countries adopting
[50:06] it companies adopting it more
[50:08] individuals adopting it um it will be
[50:11] like a self-fulfilling proc prophecy
[50:13] because everybody will have a financial
[50:14] interest in it they will also want to
[50:16] see it succeed and and push it
[50:19] Forward absolutely and uh one thing that
[50:23] just came to my mind while he was
[50:25] talking you you said
[50:28] about um you you also benefit
[50:31] financially from it so not there are not
[50:34] only people in here that do it for the
[50:36] good um and the better of society that
[50:39] there are also people in here that just
[50:40] do it for the financial sake of it um
[50:44] and it's maybe an unpopular opinion but
[50:47] I think there are a lot of bad people
[50:49] out in Bitcoin there are some like most
[50:52] people in Bitcoin are extremely kind uh
[50:54] and I think I hope my podcast kind of
[50:56] show stat out of Bitcoin because uh I I
[51:01] I will not record with with bad or like
[51:03] bad attitude people or like negative
[51:06] people I I try to only record with with
[51:09] with the good and uh if i s saw after
[51:13] publishing someone is like oh like oh I
[51:15] published the wrong one um I don't
[51:17] delete it but I just don't make a second
[51:20] one uh so I try to over time filter that
[51:23] out but there are definitely some apples
[51:27] in Bitcoin like it's it's not all all
[51:30] amazing they're not all kind and loving
[51:32] and caring there are some in
[51:34] here so uh it it's it's it's probably
[51:38] probably Bitcoin has a huge a higher
[51:40] quote than usual of like really kind
[51:42] loving and caring personalities that
[51:45] really try to move the world a little
[51:48] bit forward but it's not all of
[51:51] them yeah no it's uh I mean yeah you'll
[51:55] have that in any system right you'll
[51:56] have people who I know a lot of people
[51:59] and especially it happens with every
[52:00] bull cycle that you have people who had
[52:02] probably no idea what Bitcoin was a
[52:05] month ago and then the price Rockets up
[52:07] and now they're a Bitcoin expert and
[52:08] it's like h no you're just probably a
[52:10] scammer that's trying to trick innocent
[52:13] people into thinking you know what
[52:14] Bitcoin is and um yeah unfortunately you
[52:17] have that in any system but I think
[52:19] Bitcoin does have a good way of also
[52:22] filtering the the bad from the good and
[52:25] I think over time it becomes
[52:27] you know um it's what is it uh the
[52:30] saying it's like oh when the tide goes
[52:33] up you see who swimming naked or
[52:34] something like that um so I think in
[52:36] Bitcoin it's the same like you have
[52:38] scammers in every system but um I think
[52:41] the true the true colors show over time
[52:44] and um I try to focus like yourself on
[52:47] on the ones who do who do have a
[52:48] positive impact and who are actually
[52:50] fundamentally trying to help Bitcoin for
[52:54] for the
[52:55] better what what is it's saying when the
[52:57] tide goes up yeah it's like when the
[53:00] tide goes down you see swimming naked or
[53:02] something like that it's like uh
[53:06] something along those lines oh man I
[53:08] want to find that oh I I want to find
[53:11] that let let me see if
[53:13] I only when the tide goes out to you
[53:18] discover oh it's a one Buffett quote
[53:21] even I will share
[53:23] that exactly you you're a one Buffett
[53:26] fan I I can imagine I mean yeah I'm a
[53:28] I'm a I'm a big fan of his for I mean
[53:32] obviously he has his controversial
[53:34] opinions on on bitcoin and I think to be
[53:36] honest it's because he's not studied it
[53:39] um enough or and I think from a
[53:41] technology I think Warren Buffett is is
[53:44] not a technologist Warren Buffett is an
[53:46] investor and if you look at his company
[53:47] and his portfolio he's not well
[53:49] acclaimed for having huge technological
[53:51] Brands he's more acclaimed for having
[53:53] companies like Coca-Cola you know like
[53:54] consumer good brands and um but he's a
[53:58] genius and I mean he's what he's able to
[54:00] have done and I think also he truly
[54:02] embodies a lot of the principles of of
[54:04] Bitcoin you know he's someone who is
[54:06] incredibly humble who is uh you know
[54:09] even though he's a billionaire he still
[54:10] lives in his same there's a documentary
[54:12] actually on war Buffett that's super
[54:14] fascinating but someone who lives very
[54:17] humbly who loves what he does who is
[54:20] immensely curious you know he reads most
[54:22] of his days um and who just a happy guy
[54:26] you know like whenever you see him and
[54:28] especially well before Charlie Munger
[54:30] passed the two of them together it's an
[54:32] inspiration you know I want to be like
[54:34] that when I'm 90 years old and so um
[54:37] despite his controversial opinion on on
[54:40] bitcoin I think he's a real example for
[54:42] for a lot of people and um yeah that's
[54:45] saying only when the tide goes out do
[54:46] you discover who's been swimming naked I
[54:48] think is great and applies to a lot of a
[54:51] lot of aspects of life I love that so
[54:54] much uh only when the tide goes out do
[54:58] you discover who's been swimming
[55:01] naked I I will use that quote a lot I
[55:05] think that's a great one uh because
[55:07] there there's there's a lot there
[55:09] there's a there there's a lot of that
[55:10] and I'm a swimmer so I I naturally like
[55:13] swimming quotes like like that there you
[55:17] go new quote for your uh for your
[55:21] repertoire I love that yeah really
[55:23] really cool but yeah I do think I I I
[55:27] think if War Buffett was uh now right
[55:31] now 35 or 40 years old I think he would
[55:35] be a Bitcoin Maxi to be honest like I
[55:37] think um he's just uh he has no
[55:43] incentive to study Bitcoin and from his
[55:46] point of views I think he's just not
[55:48] ready to receive it um and he probably
[55:51] will never be like how how old is he
[55:54] like 90 something like
[55:57] I I I don't know like uh if he ever will
[56:01] get Bitcoin like the the chances are
[56:04] really low uh like let let him have his
[56:08] peace in his retirement age uh and it's
[56:12] okay for me if he's not a bitcoiner like
[56:15] he can he can a lot of people also make
[56:17] the argument of like he's a danger and a
[56:19] threat to bitcoin because he owns the
[56:22] banks and stuff like that like no let
[56:25] him hear like yes he benefited from the
[56:28] Fiat system obviously from the money
[56:30] printing um but he's a great investor
[56:32] and in his fundamental feces of like um
[56:36] uh betting on the farm long term uh and
[56:39] like how to pick great stocks and
[56:41] sticking with those stocks and don't
[56:43] diversify he's a big uh uh propon
[56:48] proponent of focusing and not
[56:51] diversifying so I I do like his
[56:54] philosophy a lot and uh let's let's give
[56:56] him a break for for not getting Bitcoin
[56:59] yeah yeah I mean that's a thing right
[57:01] like he's he's uh towards the end of his
[57:04] career and he's had an incredible career
[57:07] incred something to be incredibly proud
[57:08] of um and I think Burkshire hathway will
[57:11] see how they adapt to to the coming
[57:13] times but I think the world that he
[57:15] lived in um when he started birkshire
[57:18] hathway is a lot different from the
[57:19] world we're in now and I'm not saying he
[57:21] doesn't understand the world now but I
[57:22] know he doesn't understand Bitcoin at
[57:24] the moment and that's okay you know I
[57:26] don't think we need everybody to uh be a
[57:28] Bitcoin Maxi I think the people who
[57:31] understand it um and embrace it will be
[57:33] the ones that benefit going forward but
[57:36] yeah he's he's towards the end of his
[57:37] career he's lived life that's something
[57:39] to be incredibly proud of and so like
[57:41] you said I think we don't need to force
[57:43] Bitcoin upon him unless he comes to it
[57:45] himself and um if not we'll see if
[57:48] whoever ends up taking over B sure if
[57:50] they end up adopting Bitcoin but again
[57:52] they're in a different sector you know
[57:53] like even though they're investors I see
[57:55] that they're more I don't see burshire
[57:57] haway as a technology company I see them
[58:00] more as like a they're investing in
[58:02] companies like Coca-Cola and you know
[58:05] like consumer brands that is doesn't
[58:08] really have a relation to to bitcoin so
[58:11] um so yeah the people who get Bitcoin
[58:13] will be the ones who who profit in the
[58:15] future and uh Warren's had a great
[58:17] career and I wish him nothing but the
[58:19] best but yeah unfortunately he's not on
[58:21] the Bitcoin Wagon at the moment yeah and
[58:25] uh I think it would be huge for him to
[58:27] move onto Bitcoin like honestly that
[58:30] would that would be like the small
[58:33] cherry on top of his uh um life uh of
[58:38] like getting Bitcoin at the end of his
[58:41] career uh after attacking it that would
[58:45] be massive for his biographies massive
[58:48] for his legacy um but I don't have a lot
[58:51] of hope uh for that and I'm okay with
[58:53] that yeah um do do you do you think that
[58:58] Michael sailor might be the the the
[59:01] current War Buffett I mean Michael
[59:03] sailor is I think like 30 years uh 30
[59:06] years younger than War Bufford I think
[59:09] so to be honest because especially the
[59:11] way that they are positioning micro
[59:13] strategy at the moment um you know they
[59:16] just did the whole brand change with
[59:17] strategy and everything um the thing
[59:20] that's unique about Michael sailor is
[59:23] he's a CEO and founder of a technology
[59:26] company so I think he it's different
[59:28] from Warren because he didn't go into uh
[59:31] just create like a um a firm but I think
[59:35] what's what's
[59:38] very obvious about Michael sailor is
[59:40] he's an incredibly knowledgeable person
[59:43] someone who studied history you know
[59:45] he's done these incredible I think with
[59:46] Robert Breedlove I believe he's done
[59:48] these like incredibly inep shows of like
[59:50] what is money and going through history
[59:52] and things like that where you know he
[59:55] has so much knowledge and and a lot of
[59:57] times that's why he's also so popular in
[59:59] Bitcoin I think is because he has a way
[60:00] of like distilling those Concepts to
[60:04] make it easy to understand and to apply
[60:06] to bitcoin and to emphasize why Bitcoin
[60:07] is so important and I think he will be
[60:10] seen indeed as like equivalent to Warren
[60:13] Buffett um especially as Bitcoin reaches
[60:16] the levels that we will all expect it to
[60:18] be but he's also very young into Bitcoin
[60:20] right he's also been into Bitcoin or
[60:22] very young he's relatively young into
[60:24] Bitcoin I think he entered in the last
[60:26] cycle so um I think as he and he's also
[60:30] it's not like he's in his 30s you know
[60:31] so he's we'll see um towards the end of
[60:34] his career where where Bitcoin will be
[60:36] but I think from a knowledge perspective
[60:38] I think from a thesis perspective he'll
[60:41] be right up the par with with Warren
[60:43] Buffett in the long run yeah like he his
[60:46] way of
[60:47] explaining um bcoin is just unmatched uh
[60:52] and and I'm I'm fascinating of like
[60:55] where he goes with the explanations like
[60:57] it's really really cool to see um but
[60:59] yeah
[61:01] like he he's he's like he's not in his
[61:04] Fest but like he he's still like a good
[61:07] good times younger than ju Buffett
[61:09] against Buffett he seems young yeah but
[61:12] yeah that's that's that that's that's
[61:14] definitely true he's also not young and
[61:16] yeah he has been in Bitcoin I think 2020
[61:18] is his entry year uh I remember that
[61:21] good because it's also my entry year uh
[61:25] I think I have been
[61:26] like like I think a month before sailor
[61:30] like he was really fundamental for my
[61:32] orange building when he came on to all
[61:34] the podcast and stuff like that where
[61:36] this is where I was really forming all
[61:38] the all the thoughts uh so a month
[61:41] before he really publicly came out like
[61:43] I came in and I was like oh like this
[61:45] guy really spoke to me and it was really
[61:47] fundamental to to my understanding of it
[61:50] um one last topic I want to get into
[61:53] podcast is the uh whole nation state uh
[61:57] and Trump thing that you are currently
[62:00] uh witnessing um and where are in the
[62:03] cycle like we we talked before a little
[62:05] bit of like where we go and how how the
[62:07] adoption might go but uh where are we
[62:10] right now what do you think about uh the
[62:12] the current uh Market
[62:15] markets yeah um I think right now where
[62:18] we are in terms of like uh nation state
[62:22] adoption is pretty similar to where we
[62:25] were maybe around this time last year
[62:27] with like the ETF adoption because I
[62:30] remember when the ETF got approved it
[62:32] was kind of like a a bit of like you had
[62:35] the approval and then the price kind of
[62:37] lagged for a bit and then it shot up and
[62:39] I think similarly now like we had Trump
[62:42] who was voted into office and then
[62:45] obviously the price kind of rallied on
[62:47] his um Inauguration in the news that he
[62:50] was elected um and now in the for the
[62:53] past few weeks you know we've been in a
[62:55] bit of a low but but I think um I do
[62:58] expect that the US will adopt a
[63:00] strategic Bitcoin Reserve I don't see it
[63:03] um just from a game theory perspective
[63:05] they almost have to and I think Trump
[63:07] does have smart people in his ear and we
[63:09] saw um CEO of uh canther Fitzgerald
[63:14] Howard lutnick he was also appointed uh
[63:16] I forget what the exact position was but
[63:18] essentially one of the heads that's
[63:20] responsible for you know this digital
[63:22] asset um movement or Bill or whatever
[63:25] want to call it that they have so and
[63:28] he's also a huge huge bitcoiner he did
[63:30] an interview with Anthony pompo a few
[63:32] months ago where he was essentially one
[63:34] of the biggest Bitcoin bulls that I've
[63:36] uh I've seen and the fact that he's
[63:38] heading up this uh this unit is
[63:40] incredibly bullish news and so I think
[63:42] it's a bit of a lagging indicator right
[63:44] now I think people are still like
[63:45] waiting for a move to happen with the US
[63:48] where they will officially announce like
[63:50] an acquisition of
[63:51] Bitcoin but I think once that happens I
[63:54] do think it could be quite a significant
[63:56] event and I do think other countries
[63:58] will follow suit as well and yeah from a
[64:01] price perspective you know right now
[64:03] we're sitting at 100K um but we saw that
[64:06] 35% swing when when Trump was approved
[64:09] and so I think once we start to get more
[64:13] um true initiative from the US in terms
[64:16] of like okay now we're actually this is
[64:17] our plan this is how much Bitcoin we're
[64:19] going to acquire um I think the second
[64:22] leg of of this bowl run will start and I
[64:25] think at the depends also on on the
[64:27] other nation states if Russia and China
[64:29] decide to follow suit I would say the
[64:31] race is on but who knows um it could
[64:34] also go the opposite way and we could
[64:36] also have Trump saying I'm gonna hold
[64:38] off on that or maybe you know focus on
[64:42] on the other coins and the coins of
[64:44] the world so um you never know with
[64:46] politicians so you have to remain
[64:48] skeptical you have to remain diligent
[64:50] but over the long run it's all
[64:53] irrelevant you know Bitcoin will just
[64:54] Trend higher and higher
[64:57] yeah it's like
[64:59] really you you you got of get into the
[65:01] field of talking about Bitcoin every day
[65:04] and you're like this is happening this
[65:05] is happening and then you're kind of
[65:07] assuming out of like oh like doesn't
[65:09] matter like it it it is good I I think
[65:13] we have a responsibility to Orange peill
[65:15] people and to talk about Bitcoin uh and
[65:19] shape the narrative and educate people
[65:21] but the news are really just for
[65:23] entertaining reasons that's why I still
[65:25] don't have have a news channel uh that's
[65:27] why still I don't have anything related
[65:29] to news I might I might do it in the
[65:31] future because maybe it adds value uh to
[65:35] the
[65:35] community but I'm more interested in
[65:38] like having conversations and figuring
[65:39] out how people think about Bitcoin and
[65:41] and what what they do with Bitcoin uh so
[65:44] I don't know like maybe news have a
[65:47] different kind of uh uh like news in
[65:50] stock marazine are really important you
[65:53] want to know what's happening with your
[65:54] management team and with your stock you
[65:56] want to know what's happening with your
[65:58] crypto how fast it's going down uh but
[66:03] uh with Bitcoin it's kind of
[66:04] irrelevant it it will do its thing like
[66:07] it's a protocol who who subscribed to a
[66:10] tcpip newsletter who cares that's that's
[66:13] the thing and that's what I I I like the
[66:15] comparison that you just made of Bitcoin
[66:17] to the internet like maybe when when the
[66:20] internet was starting off people were
[66:21] like oh I'm not sure if it's like you
[66:23] have famous clips of like Bill Gates
[66:25] going on to talk shows and talking about
[66:27] like email and things like that and
[66:29] people laughing at his face and it's
[66:31] like the same thing with Bitcoin like a
[66:33] lot of people kind of laugh and and at
[66:35] your face when you talk about it maybe
[66:36] less and less now but um the adoption is
[66:39] going to come it's like it's like a
[66:41] force that you can't stop you know it's
[66:42] similar to like AI it's like it's going
[66:44] to come whether we like it or not
[66:46] whether people want it to to or not but
[66:48] Bitcoin is a it's a force that's been
[66:50] introduced into the world a miracle that
[66:53] Satoshi was able to do it in the
[66:54] circumstances that he did and I think
[66:56] it's almost like I tell people also like
[66:58] it's for me the Bitcoin creation is
[67:00] almost like a like a Divine conception
[67:03] of sorts you know it's just this thing
[67:04] that was like cast down on us we have
[67:07] this perfect money created at the
[67:09] perfect time was able to grow to a point
[67:11] where now it's essentially Unstoppable
[67:14] and so just sit back relax study read
[67:18] some Bitcoin books turn off the news and
[67:21] over time you'll be happy that you know
[67:23] you did and that you just um kept the
[67:25] level head and so um yeah it's like the
[67:28] internet the adoption is going to come
[67:30] um and yeah it'll be volatile it'll go
[67:32] up and down but for me it's a matter of
[67:35] when not if and um I think that's all
[67:37] you really have to focus on yeah
[67:40] absolutely it will come anyways um
[67:43] really cool I have one question to ask
[67:44] each and every one of my guests and the
[67:46] question is like what can we learn from
[67:48] you besides bitco I like that question
[67:52] um one thing I'm super passionate about
[67:54] is
[67:56] um well Sports and and right now I'm
[68:00] actually training for a uh an Iron Man
[68:02] in in Austria in Clen F and um that's
[68:06] another area of my life where I'm super
[68:08] passionate about because I like to push
[68:11] myself physically as well um and so I
[68:15] think a lesson that I have for people is
[68:17] like push yourself you know push
[68:20] yourself out of your comfort zones
[68:21] challenge yourselves to do difficult
[68:24] things it doesn't have to be an Iron Man
[68:26] but find things that you want to do
[68:28] challenge yourself to do them whether
[68:29] that's learning a language whether
[68:30] that's learning a new sport they could
[68:32] be a bunch of different things but
[68:34] there's so many opportunities in this
[68:36] world and you only have one life and
[68:38] life is beautiful and um you know you
[68:40] really have to just be willing to take
[68:43] risks push yourself out of your comfort
[68:45] zone and that's why for me this like um
[68:48] Iron Man and training and Sports in
[68:50] general is just a big area of my life
[68:52] where I try try to on a daily basis just
[68:55] push myself um and keep both my physical
[68:59] and my mental being intact oh I love for
[69:03] like so you're in
[69:05] Austria Austria yeah in June I love that
[69:09] really cool uh you usually you are in
[69:12] like uh where where are you based
[69:14] usually in in
[69:16] Spain ah okay nice uh like if you if you
[69:20] come to Vienna let me know like we'll go
[69:22] for coffee definitely yeah definitely
[69:26] hit you up with them
[69:28] in in June and in June there is also the
[69:32] Bitcoin prag by the way for everyone
[69:34] that is listening get your tickets
[69:36] Bitcoin prag 10% discount with code
[69:38] Robin uh this is the coolest biggest uh
[69:43] Bitcoin conference I personally like in
[69:46] inside of Europe uh I mean there's also
[69:49] like Bitcoin Amsterdam it's really cool
[69:50] also to go there there's also madira
[69:54] which is also really cool
[69:56] uh but maybe I'm biased because Bitcoin
[69:58] Prague is so close to my
[70:00] place uh that I like it the most but
[70:03] yeah Bitcoin Prague get your tickets 10%
[70:06] off with code Robin uh definitely come
[70:08] there and I think it's like 19th of June
[70:11] uh it's the weekend afterwards I I
[70:14] believe I'm trying to come to bitcoin
[70:16] Prague um right now I'm trying to work
[70:18] out uh my schedule and everything
[70:21] because there might be a family holiday
[70:23] after after the Iron Man so uh trying to
[70:26] figure everything out but it's my
[70:28] objective to go to to bitcoin progue
[70:30] because yeah it's it's um one of the
[70:32] biggest ones in Europe and uh yeah a lot
[70:35] of times you're kind of like uh that
[70:37] SpongeBob Meme where you're like looking
[70:39] outside of the window um looking down
[70:41] onto like the streets um that's how I
[70:44] feel sometimes with like the the US ones
[70:46] because they're quite far from here um
[70:49] but yeah Bitcoin Prague is is definitely
[70:51] on my radar so I'll try to get there
[70:54] yeah absolutely I I will also be in
[70:55] Vegas because it's just an event I think
[70:59] I have to be but I'm more excited that
[71:03] uh like I'm I don't know if I'm more I
[71:05] think I'm maybe even more excited about
[71:07] Vegas because it's new experience for me
[71:10] but it's a whole different uh kind of a
[71:13] conference uh for for Vegas by the way
[71:15] you can also get the tickets there with
[71:17] 10% discount with code Robin it's
[71:18] actually funny because I I start talking
[71:20] about this code Robin thing it's like
[71:23] it's hard to figure out where you don't
[71:25] get code Rob in these days I have so
[71:27] many connections now with the the people
[71:30] there and I I I always try to get like
[71:34] at least the code and then I'm some
[71:36] sometimes surprised of like I I don't
[71:38] even promote that product but because of
[71:40] the code and people are used to code
[71:42] Robin uh they just use it and they're
[71:44] like oh like it works and gets so that's
[71:47] the key here just use code Robin on any
[71:49] Bitcoin product or site and see if it
[71:52] works I want to use that if you buy
[71:54] anything being in Bitcoin like use code
[71:57] Robin try try it out yeah sorry for that
[72:01] Shameless plug um thank you so much uh
[72:05] man for for being on the show um we have
[72:07] an endine as you know uh where the
[72:09] previous guest is asking a question uh
[72:12] for you without knowing who who you
[72:15] really are uh and um the question from
[72:18] previous guest is what does freedom mean
[72:21] to you yeah that's a good one freedom is
[72:23] very important to me
[72:26] and what Freedom means to me is being
[72:29] able to do what you want whenever you
[72:32] want having control over your time I
[72:35] think is the most important thing um
[72:39] because having control of your time
[72:40] allows you to use that in the way that
[72:42] you want to use it um and a big
[72:45] byproduct of that is having control of
[72:47] your money um that's also why Bitcoin is
[72:50] so important but yeah for me freedom is
[72:52] really being able to do what you want
[72:54] when you want and I think that's
[72:56] something that you know we should all
[72:57] strive to be able to
[72:59] do 100% it's it's so beautiful really
[73:02] cool then yeah thank you so much um uh
