[00:00] you're going to see hundreds of
[00:01] trillions of dollars flow into Bitcoin
[00:02] before 2030 you're looking at a Bitcoin
[00:05] at tens of millions of dollars by 2030 I
[00:08] believe 0.1 Bitcoin is generational
[00:09] wealth when you run the numbers that's
[00:11] like
[00:13] 1.25% of the entire world can ever own
[00:16] 0.1 Bitcoin Bitcoin is digital Nomad
[00:19] money and none of them understand it
[00:21] Jeff Bezos is currently stacking
[00:23] billions of dollars worth of bitcoin he
[00:24] just sold $8 billion worth of stock
[00:27] recently and he was also recently
[00:29] spotted at a party with the Giga Chad
[00:32] Michael
[00:33] sailor I saw your live stream right
[00:36] before the the show and I I changed my
[00:39] topics a little bit because I think it's
[00:41] a really interesting topic to talk about
[00:43] how many Bitcoins do you need and a lot
[00:46] of people ask me and I always say like
[00:49] as much as you can like I like if you
[00:52] are a billionaire right now obviously if
[00:55] you just buy 0.1 Bitcoin it's not enough
[00:58] like you need way more Bitcoin than that
[01:01] but if you uh in a in a third world
[01:03] country and you can barely make it uh
[01:06] having this target of 0.1 Bitcoin is
[01:08] like a high Target uh so uh as as much
[01:12] as in is in your your possibilities uh
[01:16] but uh you talk about why 0.1 is so
[01:19] crucial and maybe let's dive into that
[01:21] why is it's so important to get to that
[01:24] number and why exactly like the 0.1
[01:28] number yeah so I believe 0.1 Bitcoin is
[01:31] generational wealth it's as simple as
[01:33] that today at the time we're recording
[01:35] 0.1 Bitcoin is worth about
[01:38] $7,000 so I just ran the numbers on a
[01:41] live stream just before I jumped on uh
[01:44] the call with you Robin and I figured
[01:46] out that I think it's around 75% of the
[01:48] world owns uh less than $10,000 so again
[01:53] that's pretty close to the $7,000 that
[01:55] you need for 10% of a Bitcoin so again
[01:57] that's massive 75% of the world cannot
[02:00] afford 0.1 Bitcoin um so again I think
[02:03] like we we kind of overestimate uh you
[02:07] know or we underestimate just how little
[02:10] Bitcoin we actually need to become
[02:12] wealthy uh because I also run the
[02:14] numbers in that live stream and and
[02:16] found that okay there's probably about
[02:18] only 10 million Bitcoin that are
[02:19] actually feasibly available for sale
[02:22] okay uh we know about 4 million Bitcoin
[02:24] are lost and we know that a lot of
[02:25] Bitcoin are in the hands of people like
[02:27] gigachad who don't plan on selling for
[02:30] 100 years um so I determined about 10
[02:32] million are available for sale based on
[02:35] the hotle waves and when you do that
[02:37] there's only really enough Bitcoin for
[02:40] 100 million people or 100 million
[02:43] families to buy 0.1 Bitcoin uh so when
[02:46] you run the numbers that's like
[02:50] 1.25% of the entire world can ever own
[02:53] 0.1 Bitcoin now I I'm sure we can talk
[02:57] about why why the math gets even more
[02:59] bullish and even more crazy than that
[03:01] later on in the podcast because that was
[03:03] a very conservative estimate but this is
[03:06] why I think uh literally 0.1 Bitcoin can
[03:09] be generational wealth if Bitcoin
[03:12] doesn't fail okay I am like CK snarks I
[03:16] think bitcoin's a binary bet it either
[03:18] fails and goes to zero or it becomes the
[03:21] money that we all use uh so again if you
[03:24] own uh 0.1 Bitcoin uh in a world where
[03:27] we hyp a Bitcoin as or even in a world
[03:30] in the next 10 years where Bitcoin is
[03:32] considered just another asset that will
[03:35] be seen as generational
[03:37] wealth and that's amazing I think I
[03:39] don't know why but I kept saying also
[03:41] the 0.1 number in my live streams I have
[03:44] I also said in the past this
[03:48] 0.26 uh or 28 uh Bitcoin of a number but
[03:51] I think that's way too high uh because
[03:54] as you said 0.1 Bitcoin this will be a
[03:57] massive wealth for a family obviously
[03:59] we're not talking in the next two years
[04:01] like in next two years probably not it
[04:04] takes a way longer time to get to the
[04:07] massive amounts of numbers but let's
[04:09] take a a step back um how did you even
[04:13] got into Bitcoin and you have a really
[04:16] interesting story also with traveling
[04:17] the world getting away from Australia uh
[04:20] starting online businesses I want to get
[04:22] in all of those different kind of a
[04:24] sections and dive into why you did that
[04:28] and how you did that and what your like
[04:30] learnings and mistakes you were along
[04:32] the way but let's start maybe like why
[04:34] even started in Bitcoin and did this
[04:37] starting online businesses and traveling
[04:39] away from Australia was Bitcoin before
[04:41] that or after that yeah so the the
[04:44] traveling and the businesses was
[04:46] certainly after Bitcoin for me I found
[04:48] Bitcoin in 2017 at the time uh I was at
[04:51] University doing a double major in maths
[04:53] and chemistry I didn't know if I wanted
[04:55] to be a doctor or an engineer so it's
[04:58] doing uh like a core double major in
[05:00] both of those so I was very very time
[05:03] poor because at the time to study for
[05:05] exams that's like 18 hours of study a
[05:07] day just to kind of keep up with you
[05:08] know like getting average CL average uh
[05:12] scores so to say in University so I
[05:14] heard about Bitcoin in 2017 in a car
[05:15] ride uh home from uh working and I
[05:19] thought hang on a minute I I somebody on
[05:21] the radio said there's this digital
[05:22] money that's scarce there's only 21
[05:25] million things and at the time Bitcoin
[05:27] was rallying from like obviously 10 K to
[05:29] 20K in under a week so I heard about
[05:32] Bitcoin at the very peak in 2017 I kind
[05:35] of knew things were a bit fruy or a bit
[05:37] bubbly but I kind of learned enough
[05:39] about Bitcoin over the next two weeks uh
[05:42] that I was I decided I was going to
[05:44] actually drop out of University to learn
[05:46] more about Bitcoin full-time uh so at
[05:48] the time I dropped out of University uh
[05:51] and I had to start a small business to
[05:54] actually have income coming in so that I
[05:57] could actually survive like at the time
[05:59] I was homeless I think I was homeless
[06:01] when I was 16 so at the time I was 18 at
[06:04] University uh doing maths and chemistry
[06:07] so started a personal training gym uh
[06:10] which I kind of built out in the garage
[06:12] of the place I was renting and that gave
[06:15] me enough income to feed me um but it
[06:19] also freed up more of my time so I could
[06:21] learn more about Bitcoin uh so that was
[06:24] 2018 and the rest is history I've been
[06:26] thinking about Bitcoin literally 18
[06:28] hours a day for the past what's that
[06:30] seven or eight years now and I
[06:32] absolutely have loved every minute of it
[06:35] wait you you you you left like you
[06:38] started learning about Bitcoin full-time
[06:41] like this was your intentions to learn
[06:42] about Bitcoin full-time I never this
[06:45] this was this is amazing so you were
[06:47] like I need more time to learn about
[06:49] Bitcoin uh so you just like quit
[06:51] everything and you're like okay let's go
[06:53] like you drop out of college and you go
[06:55] into learning about Bitcoin full time uh
[06:58] and then you're like oh I also need
[07:00] money so you started the gym so the gym
[07:02] was just it was probably like something
[07:05] you want to do but also something you
[07:08] could do like for money uh and then when
[07:11] you when you go further ahead um you ran
[07:16] that business till Australia closed down
[07:18] in the co area probably and then in 2020
[07:22] you left Australia uh for I think there
[07:24] was Mark Moss involved how was that
[07:26] going very close you know my story
[07:28] better than me I'm actually very
[07:29] impressed at the uh the prep you put
[07:32] into this interview so 2020 comes along
[07:35] uh at the time I hadn't started a
[07:37] Twitter account or a YouTube channel so
[07:39] again i' just been learning about
[07:41] Bitcoin for 2018 2019 I still haven't
[07:44] hadn't even found Twitter okay 2020
[07:47] happened and that's when I uh closed
[07:50] down um my personal training gym cuz
[07:53] very early in 2020 I could see what was
[07:56] going to happen and I knew that I was
[07:59] not not going to abide with all of the
[08:02] laws that I predicted might pop up like
[08:04] as soon as they started talking about
[08:06] you know 14 days to flatten the curve I
[08:09] was like oh this is dangerous so I
[08:11] closed down my gym immediately and I
[08:14] applied for my passport immediately
[08:16] because at the time I was 24 and
[08:18] obviously like being homeless and not
[08:20] having much money when I was younger I'd
[08:22] never traveled overseas um so I I was 24
[08:26] never left Australia so I applied for my
[08:27] passport the sad thing is I didn't
[08:29] receive my passport before the
[08:31] international borders closed permanently
[08:34] in Australia for about 2 years so I was
[08:37] stuck in Australia uh I still hadn't
[08:40] found Bitcoin Twitter I still hadn't
[08:41] created any content about YouTube or
[08:44] Bitcoin on YouTube uh so I started a
[08:47] YouTube channel in 2020 and I also
[08:48] started writing stuff online just with
[08:51] the aims of honestly educating people uh
[08:53] because uh I was in a different state to
[08:56] where all of my uh family and friends
[08:58] were where I grew up so I thought hey
[09:00] I'm going to try to orange peel them
[09:01] online so that was what I did um and
[09:04] then 2021 happened I got the amazing
[09:06] opportunity uh to work full-time with
[09:08] Mark moss and that was the ticket that
[09:11] actually got me out of Australia because
[09:13] the international borders opened up in
[09:15] Australia in
[09:17] 2022 uh but you couldn't leave if you
[09:20] had my medical status you actually had
[09:23] to have a job that would write you a
[09:25] letter to get you out of the country uh
[09:28] so obviously working with Mark it was my
[09:31] first online job so it gave me the
[09:33] potential to actually you know close the
[09:36] personal training business with some
[09:38] Authority and confidence and it was also
[09:41] the thing that got me out of Australia
[09:42] so it was an absolute blessing working
[09:44] with Mark and yeah that kind of brings
[09:46] me to uh my my escape and I I I escaped
[09:50] to Mexico because at the time Mexico was
[09:52] the only country in the entire world
[09:54] that would accept a person of my medical
[09:57] status in 2022 honestly wild two years
[10:00] of absolute hysteria so yeah I landed in
[10:02] Mexico and that kind of fills in that
[10:04] part of my story so to
[10:07] say to Mexico it's fascinating this was
[10:09] the only counter that uh how was this
[10:12] actually like uh you left uh a business
[10:15] that was kind of running with the gym
[10:17] you left probably friends family I don't
[10:20] know I don't know if you had a
[10:21] girlfriend at that time but uh like
[10:23] there are so many things besides the job
[10:26] that anchor you on a on a place and it's
[10:28] something probably really emotional and
[10:30] hard to to leave that and I I see that
[10:34] um firsthand with my girlfriend she
[10:36] comes from India she's now two years
[10:38] here and and and just see that that on
[10:42] above the financial things like you can
[10:44] find a job there you can work there you
[10:46] can make online business you can make it
[10:47] work but there are so many emotional
[10:49] things that also uh anchor you to your
[10:52] hometown how was that like just leaving
[10:54] there did you throw a a fair go going
[10:57] away party what was what was that uh
[11:00] topic about yeah I mean incredibly
[11:02] difficult like I I sh post a lot online
[11:04] and I'm very provocative like I I I
[11:07] openly say like if you're living in like
[11:09] Canada Australia New Zealand or America
[11:11] you need to get out you need to escape
[11:13] like I'm very provocative and I I
[11:14] strongly I do believe what I say online
[11:17] I really do think people need to kind of
[11:19] think about leaving these Western nation
[11:21] states and the most common like push
[11:23] back I get is okay Luke it's easy for
[11:26] you you're 26 27 now you know leaving
[11:29] your home country of Australia would
[11:30] have been easy but I had lots of things
[11:32] that made it very difficult like I had
[11:34] thousands of dollars worth of gym
[11:36] equipment sitting in my garage at the
[11:38] place I was renting I had to sell all of
[11:41] that and completely switch career paths
[11:43] like I'd sunk years into learning about
[11:45] like exercise physiology getting the
[11:48] certifications to become a personal
[11:49] trainer like it's very difficult all of
[11:51] the money I sunk into the uh like
[11:54] getting the the the ticks and the
[11:56] regulations to start a small business in
[11:58] Australia
[11:59] hours and hours in time I also had a dog
[12:02] so I had my the first dog I ever got was
[12:04] when I was 20 years old and like she was
[12:06] mine um and yeah like I mean even as a
[12:10] 20-year-old with no money it was a big
[12:12] cost to buy the dog like she's a uh
[12:14] she's a labrador she's a little
[12:16] chocolate Labrador so like thousands of
[12:18] dollars on a on a on a labrador like
[12:21] it's not just the economic cost of
[12:22] leaving my dog behind it's the emotional
[12:25] cost like I had I had her for 4 years so
[12:28] the I had so many hurdles leaving
[12:30] Australia and I also did things the
[12:32] wrong way they were right for me because
[12:35] I'm an extreme kind of person I like to
[12:37] do things I I just go all in on things I
[12:40] probably have ADHD and all sorts of
[12:41] other things wrong with me but I I so
[12:44] for me leaving Australia permanently it
[12:46] was a big decision but it was something
[12:48] I was okay with anyone I talk to I kind
[12:51] of say hey look you know do it in steps
[12:53] go on a holiday to Mexico first and see
[12:55] if you like it and go to you know
[12:57] Colombia and Argentina just for a
[12:59] holiday go for a week or two see if you
[13:00] like it go back home and then tie all of
[13:03] your Loose Ends but yeah so I made the
[13:05] entire decision uh like maybe like in
[13:09] under two weeks uh so I had to yeah sell
[13:13] everything it was an absolute nightmare
[13:15] uh There Was You Know selling all your
[13:17] stuff packing everything up uh going on
[13:19] your first international trip uh being a
[13:22] 19 hour trip to the other side of the
[13:24] world to a country that you don't speak
[13:25] the language of uh it was it was a
[13:27] pretty big it was a pretty Big Move uh
[13:29] but it's honestly the best decision I've
[13:31] ever made in my life as scary as it was
[13:34] as much as it cost um and you know that
[13:36] whole journey from going from like
[13:38] homeless to homeless so to say like
[13:40] there was so many emotional barriers in
[13:42] it um so yeah it certainly wasn't an
[13:45] easy
[13:46] decision uh yeah and you basically also
[13:50] left the country um and it's such a
[13:54] crazy story I love it and why but why
[13:57] did you have the the hurry like like uh
[13:59] obviously like you you wanted to go away
[14:01] and uh you had this two weeks but I
[14:04] guess you could have also just like take
[14:06] a month um probably as I mean taking a
[14:09] holiday there is kind of extreme also
[14:11] because then you have to pay the ticket
[14:14] ticket the plane ticket there take a
[14:18] holiday U coming back all sort of plane
[14:21] then selling everything that obviously
[14:23] that's better way to do it long term
[14:25] probably you can see different countries
[14:29] uh but with a low budget and with a
[14:31] hurry um you have to do it like that but
[14:35] why why was this hurry like why not
[14:37] taking like two months before that
[14:39] process researching more like uh why why
[14:41] was this H was there a specific reason
[14:43] yeah so there's an opportunity uh to
[14:46] meet uh Mark in person I think he had an
[14:49] event in Mexico uh at a specific date
[14:52] and the international borders just kind
[14:54] of like opened up out of nowhere like
[14:56] there was obviously like there's so much
[14:57] flip-flopping going on uh between 2020
[15:00] 2021 and 2022 uh like they would the
[15:03] government kept dangling the stick they
[15:06] would say oh you know the international
[15:07] borders are opening up next week and
[15:09] then all of a sudden you get a new wave
[15:11] of the new scaran and the the different
[15:13] thing that they just make up uh so so
[15:16] there was uh I I'll be careful what I
[15:18] say I don't want to get us kicked off
[15:19] YouTube but uh yeah there was a there
[15:21] was a narrow window of opportunity where
[15:23] the borders opened up and Mark had an
[15:25] event in Mexico and it was kind of
[15:26] perfect just to go straight to Mexico to
[15:28] made him and that was that so you worked
[15:31] for him and then you got in okay but
[15:33] then uh you are in Mexico and I think
[15:36] then your journey started where you're
[15:38] like going in different countries uh
[15:40] building your online businesses and um
[15:44] along that way you already learned about
[15:46] Bitcoin and what I'm curious about uh
[15:49] before we get into what your business
[15:50] you built and what you did there exactly
[15:52] how did Bitcoin help you and how was
[15:55] your uh experience in those countries
[15:58] with Bitcoin could you pay in Bitcoin
[16:00] did you adopted like a kind of Bitcoin
[16:02] standard where you tried to pay stuff
[16:03] with Bitcoin but or or you you always
[16:06] had the local currency you also went to
[16:08] Salvador there basically was like it's
[16:10] easier to pay with Bitcoin but uh
[16:13] there's also places where you cannot pay
[16:14] with Bitcoin how was this paying with
[16:17] Bitcoin and having Bitcoin as like your
[16:21] North Star in your store of value pH uh
[16:24] in in in traveling the world yeah so
[16:28] this is another Avenue I personally want
[16:29] to explore and I want to try to help a
[16:32] lot of the digital Nomad Community
[16:34] because I think Bitcoin is digital Nomad
[16:36] money and none of them understand it
[16:38] like none of the digital Nomads really a
[16:40] bitcoiners it it shocks me uh because my
[16:43] experience has been so much easier
[16:45] because of Bitcoin uh so like personally
[16:47] I've lived on a Bitcoin standard since
[16:49] maybe 2019 or 2020 uh I kind of fluffed
[16:53] around and you know I was kind of
[16:56] Diversified between 2017 and 18 because
[16:59] I was kind of the classical you know 120
[17:02] IQ uh meme I was just learning about
[17:05] macro and Bitcoin and I thought it was I
[17:07] didn't understand Bitcoin properly
[17:09] obviously if I wasn't 100% in it and I
[17:11] was like you know I had 20% of my net
[17:13] worth in gold and silver 20% of business
[17:16] you know 20% cash all that rubbish and
[17:18] then when you actually figure out what
[17:19] Bitcoin is you you go all in and so that
[17:22] wasn't 2020 for me but I've been all in
[17:24] on bitcoin since about then so 2020 and
[17:26] so for the entire travel Journey it's
[17:29] just being Bitcoin and yeah it's uh it
[17:32] it honestly makes the process so much
[17:33] easier uh right now from the different
[17:36] income streams I've got I think four or
[17:38] five of them are in Bitcoin but one of
[17:39] them is still in Fiat and every single
[17:41] get time I get paid in Fiat it's an
[17:43] absolute like it's just pulling hair out
[17:46] it's so it's just a massive pain in the
[17:49] ass so traveling as a nomad it's a lot
[17:52] easier with Bitcoin it certainly helped
[17:53] the process in so many different
[17:56] ways yeah interviewed Lena sya also and
[18:01] and she said she's she is doing all did
[18:04] also digital nomat I think now she's
[18:07] kind of settling down in El Salvador
[18:09] let's see how long um but being a
[18:12] digital Nomad also has so many
[18:15] implications that we don't think about
[18:17] when you uh depends on how you do it but
[18:19] if you're like more in one country in a
[18:23] year maybe like five countries even
[18:25] there are so many tax implications you
[18:27] have to do so
[18:28] things you have to fill out you so many
[18:31] things you have to do bank accounts and
[18:33] then it makes so much sense to have just
[18:35] Bitcoin as a bank account when you
[18:37] travel around the world and you have
[18:38] like five different bank accounts
[18:40] because this is not working that country
[18:41] you need to transfer this then it's
[18:43] really um really really expensive to to
[18:47] um to uh yeah wire that transfer uh so
[18:52] for me it's all like digital Nomad why
[18:55] they are not using Bitcoin just Bitcoin
[18:58] Co and making this the the medor of
[19:00] exchange um and then let's get into the
[19:04] story what businesses did you build like
[19:06] how did you grow this those things and
[19:10] how did you get started because if
[19:11] you're in Mexico you starting something
[19:14] uh and you're working obviously with
[19:16] Mark MOS you're helping bit uh Youtubers
[19:18] bitcoiners with YouTube uh you helping
[19:21] bitcoiners growing you always have uh
[19:24] yourself and and and personal brand what
[19:26] did you do yeah so essentially
[19:28] uh I was blessed and I was lucky the
[19:30] first Bitcoin job I had was with Mark
[19:32] moss and obviously he's got half a
[19:33] million Subs on YouTube uh so again when
[19:36] I was working with him full-time he
[19:37] taught me everything like uh how to grow
[19:39] on YouTube uh I was writing all the
[19:41] scripts for him on YouTube how to
[19:42] research uh YouTube videos to kind of
[19:45] differentiate yourself from the pack uh
[19:47] you know how to write Twitter threads
[19:49] emails you know all of it uh so you know
[19:51] that was great two-year opportunity and
[19:54] then kind of after um I kind of you know
[19:57] started going out there and doing my own
[19:58] thing I was just teaching other people
[19:59] how to do the same and I was surprised
[20:01] that people would actually pay me money
[20:03] to do it so uh yeah it's uh that's
[20:06] essentially kind of what I've been doing
[20:08] for the past year or so I've just been
[20:09] teaching other people how to grow their
[20:11] YouTube channel and you know how to uh
[20:13] you know write Twitter threads to go
[20:15] viral um I think like uh you once you
[20:18] kind of know all of these like tidbits
[20:20] and like secrets so to say with the
[20:23] algorithm secret sounds a bit cringy but
[20:25] like once you know how things work like
[20:27] it's very easy to just replicate this
[20:29] for other people and like you can
[20:31] Implement some very small tricks and
[20:32] tips especially with YouTube and Twitter
[20:34] and all of a sudden you can reach like
[20:36] 50x more people and that's obviously
[20:39] what we want to do as bitcoiners we want
[20:41] to Orange peill the world faster so
[20:43] that's kind of like my mission I only
[20:45] really work with bitcoiners as clients
[20:47] because I want to help them amplify
[20:50] their message um so yeah that's what I
[20:52] do right now I just help people uh
[20:54] amplify their message on YouTube and
[20:56] Twitter if their
[20:57] Bitcoin amazing amazing what what did
[20:59] you learn from Mark Moss besides just
[21:02] the YouTube thing did you get because
[21:04] Mark Moss is one of the personalities
[21:05] that got big uh they have influence they
[21:09] have status they have so many things
[21:10] going that um people drive towards uh
[21:15] like what what did you learn from him
[21:17] besides the tactics on YouTube and and
[21:20] maybe some other things do you have
[21:22] anything from you got away from him yeah
[21:25] a lot so much outside of business and
[21:28] YouTube like I think he's built like
[21:30] eight businesses that have scaled to
[21:32] more than a million dollars uh so like
[21:34] wow and this is like not just in the
[21:35] Bitcoin space this is like uh he built
[21:37] like.com companies 20 years ago so like
[21:40] he's he's ahead of the trend in a lot of
[21:42] things so working with him full-time was
[21:44] like it was like dream come true you
[21:46] learned so many life lessons something
[21:47] he used to say uh to me was like success
[21:50] leaves Clues uh so like a lot of the
[21:53] time you just go and study what the
[21:55] successful people are doing and if you
[21:56] just replicate what they're doing
[21:58] typically it's going to work out pretty
[21:59] well for you um so like he is just
[22:02] absolutely full of uh insightful nuggets
[22:05] so to say uh nothing else comes top of
[22:07] mine right now but I mean like he's one
[22:08] of the hardest working people uh that I
[22:11] know so like again success leaves Clues
[22:14] um if you want to be the best in the
[22:15] business like he is probably he's got
[22:17] probably got one of the biggest YouTube
[22:18] channels in the Bitcoin kind of macro
[22:20] Niche uh again he he works hard he he
[22:23] works 5 days a week long hours he's the
[22:25] first to get to the YouTube Studio is
[22:28] always the last to leave so uh there's a
[22:30] little there's a little hint uh you know
[22:32] most people who have made it in the
[22:33] space they they they don't it's very
[22:36] rare they make it through luck they
[22:38] typically work pretty
[22:39] hard yeah I think and even I think today
[22:42] it's even easier because uh I don't know
[22:46] if this is just a subjective feeling but
[22:49] I think people are pretty lazy these
[22:51] days uh maybe I'm wrong I I did not live
[22:53] 50 years ago but from what I hear and
[22:56] what I study and what I see and what I
[22:59] what I think I have a feeling for I feel
[23:02] like people are pretty lazy and when I
[23:05] see friend circles outside of Bitcoin
[23:07] outside of my business world that I
[23:09] intact with they uh they don't want to
[23:12] work too much they if it's a 30-hour
[23:15] work week that's that's enough for them
[23:17] like and then they come home watch
[23:18] Netflix do whatever and this is
[23:20] perfectly fine like this is don't get me
[23:21] wrong this is not something that is uh
[23:24] something bad uh but if if you want to
[23:27] expect like something higher you want to
[23:29] expect more obviously you have to put in
[23:31] more and I think you stand out these
[23:34] days if you want to take responsibility
[23:37] if you want to take higher things into
[23:39] your life uh it's so easy because you
[23:41] have to just work way more and
[23:43] experience way more with every one hour
[23:46] you put more in in a day it's
[23:48] accumulates so much and you get to other
[23:51] levels so I think this is this is a big
[23:53] thing just work as hard as you possibly
[23:56] can I'm obviously doing now seven uh
[23:59] seven recordings uh in in a week and I
[24:02] feel like I could do more yeah it's all
[24:05] it's all proof work man it's all proof
[24:06] work and I think Bitcoin is understand
[24:08] that the more work you put in the more
[24:10] you get out definitely I saw I saw one
[24:13] of your last videos I did not watch it
[24:15] actually uh but I just saw the title and
[24:18] I think the first uh 30 seconds or
[24:20] something like that I did not got to to
[24:22] watch the the whole thing unfortunately
[24:24] but you said like you want to sell
[24:26] Bitcoin at a sum at some point for
[24:29] something I guess I think I scrolled a
[24:33] little bit through it was real estate
[24:34] maybe I don't know what do you think
[24:37] about maybe at some point I want to have
[24:39] this for my Bitcoin because I've
[24:41] accumulated for that I mean I always
[24:44] joke about Bitcoin like if if people ask
[24:47] me what is your Bitcoin access strategy
[24:48] I'm like Bitcoin is for me the Bitcoin
[24:51] is for me the exit strategy what do you
[24:53] think about that yeah so uh yes so that
[24:56] was a video as a provocative video uh
[24:59] that I made the case for kind of
[25:01] thinking about what I'm going to buy
[25:03] first with my Bitcoin uh so if I were to
[25:05] ever sell some Bitcoin I kind of laid
[25:07] out my exit strategy so I had the exact
[25:10] prices where I'm going to be selling
[25:12] like X percentage of my Bitcoin stack
[25:15] and then I kind of talked about what I'm
[25:16] going to buy so like uh again I I agree
[25:20] with you uh like I think I'm not really
[25:22] going to be buying anything until
[25:24] bitcoin's repressed where it should be
[25:26] repressed because right now
[25:28] doesn't make any sense to not be 100%
[25:31] Allin Bitcoin makes zero sense that's
[25:33] why I've been Allin for the past 4 years
[25:35] but I think they becomes a price where a
[25:36] lot of the
[25:38] asymmetry is gone so to say so like uh
[25:41] for me that price is probably around a
[25:44] million doll a little bit of the
[25:45] asymmetry is gone so in that video I
[25:48] made the case that I think I'm probably
[25:49] going to sell about 11% of my stack my
[25:53] Bitcoin stack at around an average price
[25:56] of like 7 to 800,000 000 per coin um now
[26:00] that's like an average again I'm like
[26:01] DCA out so if bitcoin's at 500k I might
[26:04] sell a percent of my stack 550 I'll sell
[26:06] another percent you know 600 another
[26:09] percent but that's kind of like the math
[26:11] behind it um and the reason being
[26:14] because uh I I just want to kind of uh
[26:18] make some other purchases in my life
[26:20] like for me right now it's a very high
[26:22] priority for myself to get my hands on a
[26:25] second passport um so like a second
[26:28] passport is a massive priority for me uh
[26:30] because of the amount of money that I
[26:33] could potentially be taxed in the future
[26:35] if Australia wants to actually Implement
[26:37] citizenship based taxation which is
[26:40] something they've talked about so in
[26:41] that video specifically I said for me to
[26:44] get an Argentinian passport I might also
[26:47] have to buy property now I have called
[26:49] property a shitcoin for years now and I
[26:52] still think that property is a shitcoin
[26:54] and I won't be buying property for a
[26:55] long time and I will never ever ever
[26:58] put more than 5% of my net worth uh into
[27:02] property uh just because I think it's
[27:04] incredibly overinflated I think most
[27:06] people don't need a home and like 95% of
[27:10] your net worth should be in Bitcoin but
[27:12] in that kind of video I made the case
[27:14] that the the the second best thing to
[27:18] buy behind uh Bitcoin is probably
[27:21] passports from a sovereignty kind of
[27:23] mindset again this is just how I see the
[27:25] world and then from like uh like the
[27:28] next best thing that I would consider
[27:29] buying or not have money in is uh
[27:33] potentially property that would allow me
[27:35] to get a passport so in that video
[27:37] specifically I made the case that uh
[27:40] property in Argentina for me is one of
[27:43] the most attractive things that I would
[27:45] consider maybe putting 5% uh of my
[27:48] Bitcoin stack in if Bitcoin got to
[27:50] around like $700,000 a coin and in the
[27:54] video like I I made the case why like
[27:57] argen is like my favorite country I've
[27:59] ever been to and it's like what you get
[28:01] in Argentina uh for the price is
[28:04] incredible like you get the best food
[28:06] the best service uh one of the safest
[28:08] countries in the world and it cost you
[28:10] 80% less than what you uh get in the
[28:12] west it's incredible so Argentina the
[28:14] country I love that's why I want the
[28:16] passport but Argentina the property
[28:18] Market is a completely different Beast
[28:20] um I'm sure we might be able to get into
[28:22] that later if you're interested I know
[28:23] I've said a lot but I'm going to pause
[28:25] there for a minute so that's my thoughts
[28:26] on selling Bitcoin and for for me
[28:29] personally when it kind of makes sense
[28:31] I'm super excited to announce that this
[28:34] podcast got the first ever sponsor 21
[28:38] Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one and
[28:41] they teach and preach self custody this
[28:44] is my goto exchange when someone asks me
[28:47] oh where can I buy my Bitcoin from this
[28:50] is the easiest entry for bitcoiners and
[28:53] if you want lower fees Plus at the same
[28:56] time support this podcast use code Robin
[28:59] and click the link in the description
[29:01] yeah definitely I think selling Bitcoin
[29:04] and I definitely want to go back to the
[29:05] Argentina topic and uh like where you
[29:08] see it going and also with chav M um
[29:12] attacking his own central banks
[29:14] basically uh which I find really really
[29:16] cool uh but selling Bitcoin I also see
[29:18] it like that uh like at some point
[29:20] Bitcoin also wanting other things this
[29:22] is so ridiculous this this argument I
[29:24] hear even from people that are really
[29:26] smart and I think they they're just
[29:29] they're just too deep in the field
[29:31] mindset but they would be so smart and
[29:32] they could like they need a mind shift
[29:34] and they go out out of the feeld M
[29:36] because they saying but when everybody's
[29:39] on bitcoin standard nobody will spend
[29:41] like of course people will
[29:42] spend people want the roof over the top
[29:45] people want to go out with friends
[29:47] people want to have fun even if money
[29:50] appreciates over time this is what money
[29:52] should do actually and I think it's
[29:54] totally normal if if you like I don't
[29:57] want to say sell Bitcoin I don't want to
[29:59] say buy goods and services for that uh
[30:01] it's like the the Mind shift I I want to
[30:03] do even though I'm trying sometimes I'm
[30:06] saying selling Bitcoin but it's so
[30:08] important that uh when we get higher net
[30:12] worth in in measured in US dollar when
[30:14] we have Bitcoin we can buy things from
[30:17] that like if you if your dream house on
[30:20] some Lake you ever wanted and it's like
[30:22] only 2% of your Bitcoin stack go get it
[30:26] honestly like it's it's it's not a lot
[30:28] of your total net worth uh and fulfill
[30:31] your dreams like you worked hard you did
[30:34] you you huddled hard and uh I recently
[30:37] met personally someone in Austria that
[30:40] huddled for since
[30:43] 2012 like he bought there and never lost
[30:47] it uh the access to it and never sold it
[30:50] since uh 2023 he said and then he
[30:53] finally bought like a Ferrari just a
[30:56] random thing
[30:57] uh he he wasn't like he's otherwise
[30:59] really Frugal but he always had this
[31:01] stream I think it's it's totally fine if
[31:03] if if you're a Bitcoin and then your
[31:05] live dream is to to drive that car even
[31:09] though you know it's a bad financial
[31:10] decision but in the end of the day you
[31:12] will die also like you never nobody
[31:14] makes it out life so that's that's kind
[31:17] of my FS on on just selling or buying
[31:20] stuff with Bitcoin and that's that's
[31:23] that's also lged for for people just
[31:25] like don't do it when you don't have
[31:28] anything not throw everything away but
[31:31] back on the Argentina topic uh um why
[31:34] are you you now in Argentina right uh
[31:37] right now I'm in madira uh
[31:40] Portugal oh for for the but uh Argentina
[31:43] is uh your like there way you want to go
[31:47] or is it like your thing yes we we uh
[31:50] pamman I spent two months in Argentina
[31:52] during the uh election of Javier melee
[31:55] we wanted to be there while that was
[31:57] happening that was a great decision uh
[31:59] so but now like more recently we've kind
[32:03] of been looking for places to
[32:05] potentially try and like you know get
[32:07] second passports and even residency
[32:09] options and like uh Argentina is my
[32:12] favorite country by far I think we've
[32:13] been to I don't know but maybe like 40
[32:16] different cities and maybe 15ish
[32:18] different countries and like Argentina
[32:20] is the best place in the world uh that
[32:22] we've found so far uh so yeah we want to
[32:24] like I want to try to get a passport cuz
[32:26] the Arian passport is one of the uh
[32:29] easiest to get in the world so we're
[32:31] going to be headed back there maybe in a
[32:33] month or two uh after the Harin party in
[32:36] El Salvador and we're going to start the
[32:38] residency
[32:39] process it's F funny because every
[32:42] friend of mine who has been in Argentina
[32:45] tells only positive things about it like
[32:47] everybody is so amazed with the country
[32:49] I never been there I should go there
[32:51] what is what is amazing about Argentina
[32:53] like why why I live there and maybe also
[32:56] why fle the Western countries like
[33:00] America England Europe Australia like
[33:03] those those kind of countries why should
[33:05] someone consider moving from there to
[33:07] Argentina their base obviously you're
[33:09] doing something different you're like
[33:11] moving a lot around you're trying to do
[33:12] have different passports but maybe
[33:14] there's
[33:15] someone living in London right now and
[33:18] saying oh I am not I'm not satisfied
[33:21] with how things go is it in Argentina
[33:23] better oh yeah I mean there so many
[33:25] different things I think the one of the
[33:27] biggest things and one of the most
[33:29] important is uh Freedom aspects uh so if
[33:33] you're living in the UK you could be
[33:34] paying 30 40 maybe even 50% of your
[33:37] wages in taxes every year uh as a nomad
[33:40] you pay nothing uh so massive Advantage
[33:43] uh there's obviously cultural
[33:45] differences uh so in Latin America the
[33:48] people are a lot more traditional so
[33:51] they they're not as easily brainwashed
[33:53] with this woke mine virus that you see
[33:55] propagated in the West that's a big one
[33:58] I think but that's probably not the
[34:00] second most important I think the second
[34:01] most important to me uh would actually
[34:04] be cost of living so it's it's I people
[34:07] don't believe me when I say this but
[34:09] Argentina is literally 80% cheaper than
[34:11] the West uh like you can't go to you can
[34:14] go to some of the nicest restaurants in
[34:16] Argentina you can't spend more than like
[34:18] 11 or12 on like a high quality like 500
[34:22] gram T-bone steak like it's it's it's
[34:25] very it's incredible and meat at the
[34:27] shops is even cheaper uh so cost of
[34:30] living is a massive one uh I mean
[34:33] there's so many reasons it's very safe
[34:35] in Argentina compared to the rest of
[34:39] Latin America so I think Latin America
[34:41] overall is safer than the West so it's
[34:44] safer than America and London but I
[34:46] think Argentina is even safer than all
[34:48] of those so that's huge um and then
[34:52] obviously so I've done cultural
[34:54] differences weather's a big one as well
[34:56] so the weather in Argentina is okay can
[34:58] get a little bit cold in winter but this
[35:00] is why as a nomad you just go hop to
[35:02] Colombia where it's literally uh 12
[35:04] months of the year year round beautiful
[35:07] perfect weather uh so that's my plan do
[35:09] winter in Colombia and then rest of the
[35:12] you know seven or eight months I have to
[35:14] spend in Argentina a year in there in
[35:16] the hot weather uh so what have we done
[35:18] so far we've done uh the money you're
[35:20] going to save as a uh as a nomad through
[35:23] tax oh freedom and like if you're a tax
[35:27] pain citizen in the west the West has it
[35:29] over you like the police treat you like
[35:32] cattle they don't respect you but if
[35:34] you're a nomad in a lot of these other
[35:36] countries like you can literally do
[35:38] anything you want and just say
[35:40] UHA you say I'm sorry I'm a I'm a
[35:43] tourist and they just H they they just
[35:45] let you do whatever you want they they
[35:47] don't care um it's really funny I've got
[35:49] myself out of lots of hairy situations
[35:52] just saying that sorry I'm a tourist and
[35:54] they they don't care um so
[35:57] I I think they're the major ones nothing
[35:58] else Pops to mind but there are so many
[36:01] reasons to be a nomad and escape the
[36:03] West it's a very it's an endless
[36:05] list and why arent especially like I
[36:08] talk with so many
[36:10] Salvadorian on the podcast because they
[36:13] they on like Crown zero where Bitcoin
[36:15] adoption is happening kind of and I'm
[36:17] really interested in that story and I'm
[36:19] I'm heading probably in November this
[36:22] year to a Bitcoin conference in El
[36:24] Salvador because I would just want to
[36:25] see it for myself uh What uh all those
[36:28] people on my podcast talked about um why
[36:31] do you and you also spent I think half a
[36:33] year or something like that or maybe
[36:35] more in in El Salvador um why Sal why
[36:39] Argentina in front of El Salvador is the
[36:42] it's just a personal preferences or is
[36:44] it like is there like a hard reason for
[36:46] that yes El Sabor is one of my favorite
[36:49] countries like year round great weather
[36:52] the friendliest people I've ever met in
[36:53] the entire world come from El Salvador
[36:56] that's like not even negotiable like
[36:58] they are the most friendly people
[37:00] especially if you're a tourist uh but
[37:01] for me I think there's a little bit more
[37:03] to do in Argentina you have uh better
[37:06] infrastructure uh you uh for now again
[37:09] El Salvador is uh building and growing
[37:12] very rapidly and improving very rapidly
[37:15] um but for me there's more to do in
[37:17] Argentina more high-end restaurants and
[37:19] the cost of living is like it it's
[37:21] incredibly cheap the way I think about
[37:23] it is Argentina is probably like 80%
[37:26] cheap than the West El Salvador might be
[37:29] like 15 to 20% cheaper than the West uh
[37:32] so yeah that's kind of it's not it's not
[37:35] ridiculously cheap cheaper than the west
[37:36] and it's good um but yeah as an average
[37:40] that's kind of how I look look at it um
[37:42] and then actually I think El was
[37:44] probably like 25% cheaper than the West
[37:46] more I think about it uh but I mean the
[37:49] cultural differences as well so in
[37:50] Argentina they call it uh Latin uh they
[37:53] what do they call it Lam light so the
[37:55] reason they call it Latin America light
[37:58] is because they actually have the
[37:59] infrastructure more like Europe so a lot
[38:01] of the architecture it's very European
[38:03] it's absolutely gorgeous like it used to
[38:06] be the richest uh What uh buenus I can
[38:10] never pronounce the name of the capital
[38:12] city but ba is what I call it they they
[38:15] used to be like one of the richest
[38:16] cities in uh Latin America um and
[38:18] Argentina used to be one of the richest
[38:20] countries um in the world only 100 years
[38:22] ago before they got taken over by
[38:24] Communists and had their currency
[38:26] trashed over the past 100 years so like
[38:28] and it looks like one of the richest
[38:30] countries in the world like it's
[38:31] beautiful the architecture the statues
[38:34] everywhere it's it's honestly an
[38:35] incredible
[38:37] country that's a fascinating topic that
[38:39] just popped up in my head when you I
[38:42] think the internet and then Bitcoin also
[38:46] enables more and more people to be uh
[38:49] not bound to a country I see more and
[38:52] more people like freelancing uh it gets
[38:55] more popular homeschooling gets more
[38:56] popular all those decentralizing things
[38:59] away from the state are getting more
[39:00] popular it's just like even like private
[39:02] schools are getting more numbers than
[39:04] the public schools there's so many
[39:06] different metrics we can look at now
[39:08] where we can see people want more
[39:10] decentralization they want to get out
[39:12] from the those um I don't know
[39:16] traditional or this systems just let's
[39:18] just call it like that um how do you see
[39:21] it in in the future where people having
[39:23] the possibility to just like start a
[39:25] YouTube channel earn something flee
[39:27] their country live wherever they want
[39:29] have Bitcoin where it's it's really it's
[39:32] it's harder to tax and stuff like that
[39:34] how do you see that kind of a future
[39:36] where I always see like the the sheep
[39:39] that cuts the flywheels and gets out of
[39:41] the out of their jurisdiction how do you
[39:45] see that going in the next like 10 20 50
[39:48] years uh is am I a dreamer or is it is
[39:52] it getting in the right direction or do
[39:54] you see some some some bad things
[39:56] happening yeah no so again I'm a
[39:58] sovereign individual uh thesis
[40:00] maximalist love the book I think we're
[40:02] living through the first technological
[40:04] Revolution that is actually
[40:05] decentralizing Us in tens of thousands
[40:08] of years uh so to maybe explain the
[40:10] thesis of the book in 30 seconds uh
[40:12] we've gone through like uh four major
[40:14] phase shifts as a civilization so for
[40:17] hundreds of thousands of years we were
[40:19] hunters and gatherers then we saw the
[40:21] technological revolution of Agriculture
[40:23] pop up and this 10,000 years ago NE
[40:26] alized everybody into these farms and
[40:28] Villages where they're on farms toiling
[40:30] the soil uh in the Agricultural
[40:32] Revolution then uh 250 years ago we saw
[40:36] the next major organizational phase
[40:39] shift in uh in our civilization and this
[40:42] was the Industrial Revolution when
[40:43] everybody now went from these farms and
[40:46] Villages into these big mega cities to
[40:49] work on the machine lines in these big
[40:51] Mega uh factories but now we're living
[40:54] through what the sovereign individual uh
[40:58] authors call the information uh age and
[41:02] we're now transitioning away from
[41:04] industrial societies into
[41:06] information-based societies where you
[41:08] can have everything in the clouds it's
[41:11] all in the air it's all uh absolutely
[41:14] nothing you do is now based upon your
[41:16] locality or where you're uh physically
[41:18] located you can earn your money online
[41:21] you can store your money online in your
[41:23] head uh you can literally do anything
[41:25] you want because of the world we're
[41:27] living in so yeah I think the need to be
[41:30] able to firstly communicate well online
[41:33] that's a big one but like f revenue
[41:36] streams online is an absolute massive
[41:38] one and obviously understanding Bitcoin
[41:41] so that you store your wealth online is
[41:43] a huge one because the thesis of the
[41:45] book says these Western nation states
[41:47] are only going to become meaner and more
[41:50] tyrannical uh the you know the more time
[41:53] that passes just because it's pure
[41:55] economic
[41:56] they have to become more tyrannical
[42:00] because of the debt they have it's the
[42:01] only way they can pay it um so things
[42:04] are only going to get worse in the west
[42:06] okay it's the only way you can deal with
[42:09] uh the highest levels of debt that our
[42:11] world is dealing with today in like a
[42:13] 100 years um so yeah I think uh being a
[42:16] nomad and you know reading the tea
[42:18] leaves so to say and escaping the West
[42:21] is going to be super important and the
[42:23] way you escape the west and the way you
[42:25] escape all of the really nasty things I
[42:28] see coming in Western countries 2020 was
[42:31] just a taster and the way you escape
[42:33] them is by making yourself Invincible
[42:36] online so uh you learn how to make money
[42:40] online and you learn how to store your
[42:41] Bitcoin correctly so uh I I don't I
[42:44] think you're on the money I think I
[42:46] think we are living through this digital
[42:47] wave and I think a lot of jobs are going
[42:50] to be automated you're still going to
[42:52] need some physical jobs like for the
[42:54] next 10 or 20 or 30 years is but I think
[42:57] like that percentage is going to only
[42:58] get smaller and smaller which means
[43:00] you're going to have to figure out how
[43:01] to make money
[43:03] online yeah it's fascinating for me
[43:05] because when we think about uh when
[43:09] Robotics and AI is getting better and
[43:12] better uh why do we need people that
[43:15] clean stuff robots can do that they it's
[43:18] already starting in the house they
[43:20] trying uh the the vacuum cleaners the
[43:23] even cleaners for the windows and this
[43:26] gets more and more evolved over time
[43:28] there me like what what jobs will be
[43:32] there in the future what will people do
[43:34] in the future and I always think about
[43:36] they will be doing um the things that
[43:39] push Society forward the the most it
[43:44] will not be uh screwing something
[43:46] together or building some some things it
[43:49] this the manual things will be more and
[43:51] more handled by robotics I think and
[43:54] then it comes down to knowledge and
[43:56] information and thinking about stuff and
[43:59] strategizing how do you see that coming
[44:01] in the next like 50 years if you think
[44:04] about that how robotics can involve like
[44:06] I think the the the crazy videos where
[44:08] the robotics jump around and play
[44:10] football and I'm like they they will be
[44:13] soon be able to do physically almost
[44:17] everything and way better and longer and
[44:19] with no sleep and stuff like that then
[44:21] humans why do we need even humans for
[44:24] physical stuff then we need everything
[44:26] everybody has to have some information
[44:29] related job no I 100% agree uh
[44:33] everything's going to be information
[44:34] based uh Ai and Robotics are going to
[44:37] take away a lot of physical jobs I still
[44:40] think this is a good thing and I'm not
[44:42] as scared as of AI as many people in the
[44:46] Bitcoin space are um I think we still
[44:49] need to be cautious I think there's
[44:51] risks there if AI can get into the hands
[44:54] of the wrong people but at the moment I
[44:57] don't think we have AGI I don't think we
[44:59] have artificial general intelligence
[45:01] right now and I I think I I think it I
[45:04] think we'll be okay I don't think AI uh
[45:08] is going to be a threat again there's a
[45:09] possibility but I I think we're going to
[45:11] be okay um and I think it's largely
[45:13] going to be a very positive thing
[45:14] because people who understand how to use
[45:16] these tools are going to benefit most
[45:18] people who don't could
[45:20] potentially uh like slip into an even
[45:24] worse position where they are right now
[45:26] where like a lot of these people who are
[45:28] kind of like Doom scrolling on social
[45:29] media they could potentially just be
[45:32] Doom scrolling on the social media where
[45:34] they're watching R uh you know robots
[45:36] create all these fake accounts and you
[45:38] know these fake AI accounts so I I think
[45:41] AI largely doesn't concern me um and
[45:44] Robotics that whole Trend doesn't
[45:46] concern me um but I can certainly see
[45:49] how it's probably going to be negative
[45:51] to some people but positive to
[45:53] some I I love the quote I don't know
[45:55] from whom it is uh AI will not take your
[45:58] job but a person with eii
[46:01] Will and it's such an amazing line
[46:03] because when I just think pra practical
[46:06] about my um podcast right now in my
[46:10] podcast right now uh I work uh and have
[46:14] different things to do like I have
[46:16] things to do for for scripting I have
[46:19] titles thumbnails I have to do a lot of
[46:21] things and honestly without the EI tools
[46:25] that help me prepare stuff help me
[46:27] process stuff help me transcript stuff
[46:30] uh I probably need one or maybe even two
[46:34] persons to do the job with me I could
[46:36] not do it alone on that huge quantity
[46:39] with like five podcasts a week um so I
[46:42] think AI will eliminate jobs but it will
[46:46] still like it will be a person with AI
[46:49] eliminating a job and not directly AI I
[46:52] mean that it's kind of yeah but you know
[46:54] you got what I mean
[46:56] um and this's also funny topic this I
[47:00] don't know I talked with I think Lisa it
[47:04] was no Ella Ella have talked with that
[47:07] uh about that will AI choose Bitcoin as
[47:10] a store of valure because eventually
[47:13] also AI wants to have something uh and
[47:16] yeah it's a it's a fun topic did you
[47:18] thought about that General ey and then
[47:20] is are they choosing Bitcoin have have
[47:23] do humans have to fight with a about how
[47:26] many Bitcoins we have yeah they uh we
[47:28] talked about at the beginning of today's
[47:30] podcast uh 0.1 Bitcoin is generational
[47:33] wealth and there's not enough for most
[47:35] people to accumulate it and I think you
[47:36] will have to be competing with the AIS
[47:39] to accumulate that scarce SATs um I
[47:41] think yeah the AI is going to be using
[47:43] Bitcoin and I think that's a great quote
[47:44] you mentioned as well every uh AI is not
[47:47] going to take your job but the person
[47:48] using the AI probably is going to take a
[47:50] job and it's it's something I use
[47:52] relatively routinely uh not as bullish
[47:55] as many people people are on AI right
[47:57] now but I still use it from time to time
[48:00] um but yeah I think uh you you should
[48:02] continue to I think you should be
[48:04] keeping an eye on what's evolving in the
[48:06] AI space uh to because it's getting
[48:09] pretty good we uh we translate some of
[48:11] my videos uh directly into Spanish using
[48:13] an AI and it's it's pretty it's pretty
[48:16] good my girlfriend speaks Spanish
[48:17] fluently and she says it's like you know
[48:20] 99% of the way there I actually sound
[48:22] less like a Greeno and more like a
[48:25] Latino so to say h so yeah I think AI is
[48:28] fascinating it's one of the rabbit holes
[48:30] I like to keep an eye on outside of the
[48:32] Bitcoin space amazing amazing um for
[48:36] slowly getting to the end of the podcast
[48:38] I want to get into um your Bitcoin
[48:41] artlook uh what you're seeing Bitcoin
[48:43] coming to in the next uh 5 10 20 years
[48:46] where you see the adoption growing um
[48:49] maybe less from the price I think price
[48:51] predictions are really hard to make uh
[48:55] obviously if if you have a price
[48:56] prediction for 5 10 years you can
[48:57] definitely make it but uh I'm more
[48:59] interested in like do you think there
[49:02] will be like we have 2020 with the first
[49:04] publicly traded company with micro
[49:07] strategy coming in and now we're like at
[49:09] 80 companies or something like that uh
[49:11] and we have El Salvador with the first
[49:13] country really adopting it will be in 10
[49:15] years 80 countries that adopted Bitcoin
[49:18] similar than El Salvador what do you see
[49:20] the the the growing the the drivers that
[49:23] grow Bitcoin in the next like 10 20
[49:26] years and maybe also how is how he
[49:28] playing the Bitcoin ETF a role in there
[49:30] or is not playing a role the long-term
[49:33] Vision yeah so before I tell you where I
[49:36] think bitcoin's going to be in 10 years
[49:39] I'm going to because people are going to
[49:40] call me crazy I'm going to explain why I
[49:42] think Technologies get adopted
[49:44] exponentially uh so I I I think like if
[49:47] you look at the major Technologies the
[49:49] broadband internet uh the adoption curve
[49:51] of automobiles and the adoption of
[49:54] smartphones they all follow a very
[49:56] similar kind of adoption trajectory so
[49:59] it took most of them on average around
[50:01] 12 years to go from uh 0 to 10% adoption
[50:05] but then it took them the same amount of
[50:06] time to go from 10% adoption to 90%
[50:10] adoption so 12 years to guard that
[50:12] steepest part of the S curve so since
[50:15] 2021 this has been my mental model for
[50:17] Bitcoin uh I I believe that 2020 was the
[50:22] inflection point where things started
[50:24] changing and again people say you know
[50:27] it's crazy but if you just look at the
[50:28] data like something clearly changed in
[50:31] 2020 in 2021 and 20122 that was our
[50:34] first bare Market uh where we actually
[50:37] saw the Bitcoin price correct but the
[50:39] Bitcoin hash rate go parabolic uh so
[50:42] I've been screaming about this for years
[50:43] saying nation states are mining Bitcoin
[50:46] today um before 2020 we had no public
[50:49] corporations uh putting Bitcoin as
[50:51] balance sheet post 2020 we've got
[50:53] Michael sailor the world's richest man
[50:55] Elon Musk and even more recently in a
[50:57] live stream I speculated that um Jeff
[51:00] Bezos is currently stacking billions of
[51:03] dollars worth Bitcoin he just sold 8
[51:05] billion worth of stock recently and he
[51:08] was also recently spotted at a party
[51:11] with the Giga Chad Michael sailor um so
[51:14] again I don't think you can be having a
[51:15] conversation with Michael sailor that's
[51:17] not about Bitcoin so doesn't surprise me
[51:19] if uh Bezos has put some uh money into
[51:22] Bitcoin but everything you look at like
[51:24] coins on Exchange as well uh like for
[51:27] the first 11 years of bitcoin's life
[51:29] before 2020 coins were only sent to
[51:31] exchanges since then coins have only
[51:33] left exchanges 1.2 million coins have
[51:36] left exchanges since 2020 that's 40% of
[51:39] all the available Bitcoin on exchanges
[51:41] gone disappeared if you extrapolate that
[51:43] Trend out there's no Bitcoin on
[51:45] exchanges by 2028 uh so my belief has
[51:48] been that when there's no Bitcoin on
[51:50] exchanges you're going to find out who's
[51:52] swimming naked and we're going to find
[51:54] out what's the true price of Bitcoin I
[51:56] didn't think we found it yet so that's
[51:58] why so I personally believe that 2030
[52:01] were pretty close to hyperbitcoinization
[52:03] from a monetary standpoint so I think
[52:07] we've uh we've kind of seen a lot of the
[52:11] appreciation of Bitcoin in regards of it
[52:13] being a store of value so I think you're
[52:15] going to see tens and maybe even
[52:17] hundreds of trillions of dollars flow
[52:18] into Bitcoin over the uh before 2030 um
[52:21] and that's simply uh there's not only
[52:24] because of
[52:25] the the reason that we're going to run
[52:27] out of Bitcoins on exchanges and for why
[52:29] I believe we're kind of in this silent
[52:32] uh nation state Bitcoin hash race right
[52:35] now but also because of how quickly Fiat
[52:37] is deteriorating so like the time span
[52:40] between each recession in Fiat land is
[52:43] getting closer and closer together so
[52:45] you had like uh 2008 and then 2020 we're
[52:49] supposedly in another recession right
[52:51] now depending upon how you measure it
[52:53] like I think the recessions are getting
[52:55] getting closer and closer together and
[52:56] the responses to each recession are
[52:58] getting bigger and bigger and it's
[53:00] getting more and more exponential the
[53:02] amount of Fiat that needs to be printed
[53:04] so that's a very long answer but I'm a
[53:06] firm believer that we are uh looking at
[53:09] a Bitcoin again I don't care about price
[53:11] but I think price kind of tells you a
[53:13] little bit about how much the world has
[53:15] changed and I think you're looking at a
[53:17] Bitcoin at tens of millions of dollars
[53:20] by 2030 um and it's all because things
[53:23] get adopted exponentially and like I
[53:25] play out I think we've already started
[53:27] to see the beginning of exponential
[53:29] change in the Bitcoin data I think uh
[53:32] the only thing that's kind of held price
[53:34] back so much now between 2020 and 2024
[53:38] is the fact that bitcoin's been under
[53:40] attack so operation choke point 2.0 uh s
[53:43] bankman freed selling 880,000
[53:46] bitcoins worth of naked shorts on his
[53:49] exchange FDX billions of dollars and
[53:52] then obviously China Banning Bitcoin
[53:54] mining right as Bitcoin was going
[53:56] parabolic in that 2021 bull market like
[53:59] a uh yeah that's my case I think we're I
[54:01] think most people are wildly bearish I
[54:03] think diminish in returns is an absolute
[54:05] Meme and I think this digital gold
[54:07] narrative is an absolute meme I think uh
[54:11] I I think it's far more likely again CK
[54:13] talks about this all the time I think
[54:14] it's uh far more likely that Bitcoin
[54:17] fails and goes to zero uh than it is
[54:20] that it just kind of hovers around at
[54:21] like $500,000 a coin uh which is I think
[54:25] is the base case uh in the Bitcoin space
[54:28] most people believe ah bitcoin's going
[54:29] to be at $500,000 by 2030 and you know
[54:33] its best returns will be behind it and
[54:35] it won't be volatile anymore I think the
[54:37] exact opposite is
[54:39] true oh yes I totally agree with you I
[54:41] think most bitcoiners are not ready for
[54:43] what's coming I think most people like
[54:46] 99.9% of people that hold right now
[54:49] Bitcoin and not ready what Bitcoin will
[54:52] do in the next 10 years that's I think I
[54:55] think you cannot really be ready for
[54:56] that but I think most just completely
[54:59] underestimated uh what this revolution
[55:01] is actually doing for for it and this is
[55:04] actually also a question for the endro
[55:06] tee I have endro te where the previous
[55:08] guest ask a question for the next guest
[55:10] it's like I stole that idea from the
[55:13] Diary of CEO podcast and it kind of
[55:15] connects really nicely with the
[55:17] blockchain because then the previous
[55:20] guest is connected with like a block
[55:22] with the next guest and so on and so on
[55:24] so I really love that that end routine
[55:27] uh and the question from the previous
[55:29] guest for you is what do you think
[55:31] Bitcoin could do uh for Independent
[55:34] Artists and for Content creators it uh
[55:37] the previous guest was Robbie B Robbie B
[55:39] is and the the Bitcoin rapper yeah his
[55:44] few nice songs if you know him uh and he
[55:47] asked like what can Bitcoin do for for
[55:50] that kind of fear obviously Financial
[55:52] thing but what do you think so Robbie's
[55:55] asking me that question from the
[55:57] past yes Robbie asked that question for
[56:00] the next guest without knowing who is
[56:02] the next guest okay okay brilliant a
[56:05] brilliant question brilliant concept I
[56:07] uh watch Diary of a CEO religiously and
[56:10] absolutely love uh what they're doing
[56:12] over there so I'm probably going to
[56:14] steal that from you and him as well
[56:16] because that's a great idea it's really
[56:18] cool um so okay uh what's Bitcoin going
[56:21] to do for Content creators and art
[56:23] creators um uh again I think Bitcoin is
[56:26] digital money uh all of a sudden you can
[56:28] now sell your art online um or anywhere
[56:32] around the world you could sell it
[56:33] physically uh but again Bitcoin is going
[56:35] to enable uh you to do that and I think
[56:37] oh here here's another angle uh I love
[56:39] spontaneous questions so uh what why why
[56:43] did we have this uh why did we have the
[56:46] Renaissance in the 1600s where we saw
[56:48] all of this amazing artwork created and
[56:51] even more broadly ignore the 1600s think
[56:53] about just the Modern Age
[56:55] like ancient Greece and the Romans think
[56:58] about what all of these amazing Empires
[57:00] built how did they build such structures
[57:05] that took so long to build and it took
[57:07] so much planning literally decades and
[57:10] centuries to build some of these things
[57:12] it's because they had the time they
[57:13] weren't running on this Perpetual
[57:15] hamster wheel trying to work 50 hours a
[57:18] week to pay their Fiat bills because uh
[57:21] you know their their uh rent payments
[57:24] and their car payments and their tuition
[57:27] payments are literally like 90% of their
[57:29] income um so I think hard money was the
[57:33] reason why we had time in the past to
[57:35] create such beautiful structures I think
[57:38] hard money today can do all of that for
[57:41] individual uh content creators and
[57:44] artists um who want to uh create and put
[57:47] a lot of time into the things they
[57:50] produce yeah that's a that's a beautiful
[57:52] answer honestly that's really really
[57:54] cool uh it was actually a pleasure
[57:56] interviewing you a pleasure talking with
[57:58] you I have have a list of topics and I
[58:00] did not go to half of them but I'm
