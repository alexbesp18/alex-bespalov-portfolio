[00:00] even a smaller number of stats will be a
[00:02] significant Fortune because money will
[00:04] be more sound 0.1 Bitcoin will be $5
[00:07] million in today's purchasing Powers
[00:10] terms if you're measure it in Satoshi
[00:12] and Bitcoins then you just see a number
[00:14] going up every two weeks when you get
[00:15] paid and you honestly feel much more Zen
[00:18] Bitcoin makes you more frugal it will
[00:20] make everybody and make the world better
[00:22] on individual level on family level and
[00:24] also for our countries a few years ago
[00:26] it was oh come to 6.125 bitcoin then a
[00:30] few years back it was like oh come to
[00:32] one Bitcoin now if the new goal get to
[00:34] 0.1 Bitcoin Bitcoin as a monetary asset
[00:37] is far superior to me than gold my life
[00:40] is getting better when I'm on a Bitcoin
[00:42] standard Bitcoin reduces my jealousy
[00:44] reduces my anxiety makes me realize that
[00:47] anything good that happens in the world
[00:48] in a new invention in India in China in
[00:52] Africa anywhere in Europe anywhere it's
[00:54] going to benefit me Larry think works
[00:56] for me everybody in Bitcoin works for me
[01:02] it's a great honor to have you uh and
[01:05] you have something interesting you have
[01:06] background in Psychology and math as as
[01:09] I understand it is that
[01:11] right yeah that's correct that's correct
[01:13] I have a PhD in educational methods
[01:16] quantitative methods in educational
[01:18] psychology so I'm a math educator I
[01:21] studied psychology and I think a lot of
[01:24] ways it maybe led me to be curious about
[01:27] Bitcoin years ago how has this
[01:30] um and then I really want to get into
[01:32] MAF and psychology a little bit later
[01:33] and how this related to bitcoin um also
[01:36] with your with your background but in
[01:38] general how does this background with M
[01:42] ma math and with uh psychology has
[01:45] shaped your few uh on
[01:48] bitcoin yeah it it made me curious about
[01:52] Bitcoin because math has rules zero
[01:54] cannot equal one you cannot divide by
[01:56] zero the conservation of energy the
[02:00] conversation conservation of of mass
[02:04] this all these rules you you it makes
[02:07] you think in a system almost like an
[02:09] engineer and so so when somebody
[02:11] explains Bitcoin to you you you're
[02:13] originally very skeptic and so but
[02:16] you're very curious about it you're even
[02:18] curious about you know what is the
[02:20] entropy in 24 words or 12 words you're
[02:23] very curious about these little things
[02:25] before you adopt Bitcoin as a as a math
[02:27] person as a psychology person you really
[02:31] um have a lot of obstacles maybe that
[02:33] you put for yourself you almost have to
[02:36] convince yourself that okay it's safe
[02:38] and secure okay it is centralized it is
[02:42] peer-to-peer and and so on and then and
[02:46] then from a psychology point of view
[02:47] Robin I find something is always
[02:50] stopping you is it the psychology is it
[02:52] the ego is it the fear of loss and then
[02:55] even when you get into Bitcoin are you
[02:58] going in there with a fear mentality to
[03:01] make money almost like a like a like a
[03:04] tech stock are you are you in it to
[03:06] erase a previous loss from your from
[03:10] your past history from your life even
[03:13] from your ancestors so it's it's um it
[03:16] all ties in but it definitely gives you
[03:18] a framework math gives you framework
[03:20] rules that that immediately if if you
[03:23] see violations of axioms and rules you
[03:27] you immediately start seeing oh there a
[03:30] there's a there's a weakness in Fiat
[03:31] that's a thread that you can pull and
[03:34] then or or a card that you could pull
[03:36] and a house of card falls
[03:38] down it's so interesting because I so
[03:41] often ask the question of like how
[03:43] Bitcoin will uh change society and I
[03:46] think you as someone who has experience
[03:48] with psychology with our brain and how
[03:50] we are wired um I think the answer could
[03:53] be really interesting how do you think
[03:56] does money influence our brain or
[04:00] differently ask what will change in
[04:02] society if we have sound money versus if
[04:06] we have as right now feat money as the
[04:09] dominant resource like I'm really
[04:10] talking of like what will change to our
[04:12] brains our psychology when we have sound
[04:16] money completely in our whole planet
[04:18] there's no central banks there's no
[04:20] money printing sound money let's say
[04:22] Bitcoin is the foundation to
[04:24] everything yeah that's a really
[04:26] interesting point I mean if we had that
[04:29] I think a lot of people's behaviors will
[04:32] change somebody may not want to spend
[04:35] their last dollar on a on on a on a sin
[04:37] on a or or a or a vice maybe a cigarette
[04:40] or something something that's that's
[04:43] more right now so time preference as sa
[04:46] amus explains the concept time
[04:48] preference time com time preference um
[04:51] will become lower that's very important
[04:54] there's a lot of nihilism a lot of
[04:56] feeling that a lot I see it with younger
[04:58] Generations um that they cannot buy a
[05:01] house they cannot save their wealth is
[05:04] melting that and and and that really um
[05:08] changes when you have sound money
[05:11] because even if you have a single dollar
[05:13] you can invest it in an asset like
[05:15] Bitcoin but you couldn't do the same
[05:17] with investing it in real estate for
[05:19] example there are thresholds that you
[05:21] cannot make and then you know Robin I
[05:24] mean I I was born in a different part of
[05:26] the world I I came to the US I'm very
[05:28] grateful but I got to see how even in
[05:32] how populations migrate from I I don't
[05:36] know if that if that's a good term from
[05:38] the third world to the second world to
[05:40] the first world a lot of that was forced
[05:43] because people cannot save where they
[05:45] are and they're seeking another um
[05:49] another place so you know you see it
[05:50] very common like a professional would
[05:53] move from their home go to the Gulf area
[05:56] and work for a few years and then try
[05:58] either to save money and go back home or
[06:00] then save money and try to go to the
[06:03] West Australia North America Europe and
[06:06] I'm not saying that that's that's
[06:09] harmful I'm I'm saying that in a Bitcoin
[06:11] standard everybody will have opportunity
[06:14] where they are and it would and they
[06:16] would not be forced to to to always have
[06:19] to move to the west and I think I think
[06:21] it will make everybody and make the
[06:23] world better on individual level on
[06:26] family level and also for our countries
[06:28] it will be more stable
[06:30] it's interesting because you uh
[06:32] originally come from Ira uh if if I if I
[06:35] remember that correctly and now you are
[06:37] I think in the USA so so like you
[06:40] migrated from from aric there so so on
[06:43] the one hand like you have a lot of
[06:45] experiences with like different cultures
[06:48] because like Arc and then then USA like
[06:50] those are already two very different uh
[06:53] cultures and and living experiences um
[06:56] what did you learn there for uh for life
[06:59] and also maybe what what Bitcoin related
[07:01] is with with countries and what money
[07:03] they use yeah that's a that's a really
[07:05] good question so in in much of the world
[07:08] in in that part of the world I'm very
[07:10] lucky I was born in Iraq I I grew up in
[07:13] Kuwait and my family we know we came to
[07:15] the US and I'm very grateful because
[07:17] that's upbringing I got to see another
[07:20] part of the world where um you know gold
[07:23] is money like it's there's a higher
[07:25] emphasis on gold I know if you I have
[07:27] friends from India and they say it's the
[07:29] same same thing gold is money everything
[07:31] else is paper and then I grew up in a
[07:34] world where the US dollar was considered
[07:37] sound money relatively of course to the
[07:40] Fiat currencies of the time but I also
[07:43] got to see it in my own lifetime I mean
[07:46] not many people can say that they got to
[07:48] see it in their own lifetime you know we
[07:50] read in the history books about Zimbabwe
[07:53] and and why my Republic but I got to see
[07:56] it even in Iraq for example in the 70s
[07:59] very strong currency roughly the roughly
[08:03] the Iraqi dinar was like three US
[08:05] Dollars almost like a pegged um and and
[08:09] very similar to the Kuwaiti Dinar now
[08:11] which is the strongest currency in the
[08:13] world in terms of uh how many dollars it
[08:15] is for one Kuwaiti Dinar but I guess I
[08:18] what what I'm saying is I got to see it
[08:19] in my o own
[08:21] lifetime Robin because I'm 54 where the
[08:25] where the Iraqi dinar went from
[08:27] being hard money
[08:31] you know in the 70s with the oil
[08:32] revenues and then slowly the government
[08:34] started printing it on thinner paper on
[08:38] Xerox paper to fund the the the war in
[08:41] the 80s and I started seeing how slowly
[08:44] people started to to behave and I see it
[08:48] even now I I I think back and I see how
[08:50] my parents and my family were behaving
[08:52] and how gold
[08:53] became more money people started
[08:56] realizing this I started I remember even
[08:58] that at some point there was the the
[09:00] Iraqi government said we need money from
[09:04] the people's people's houses from
[09:06] people's possessions we needed to donate
[09:08] to the war effort and it was a big
[09:11] propaganda big thing and and and they
[09:13] would show like women would walk and
[09:15] take off their gold necklace and and and
[09:17] donate it to the war effort so I I got
[09:20] to see that and it made sense to me um
[09:24] later how the basement of currency is
[09:27] really harmful it it hurts everything
[09:31] that memory I thought I forgot it and
[09:32] then with Bitcoin all these memories
[09:34] came back what were some of the effects
[09:37] that you have seen like you lived
[09:39] through that inflation in Iraq uh with
[09:42] with your family uh with your friends
[09:44] you probably have a lot of stories
[09:46] around that where you all of the sudden
[09:48] look back and like oh yeah like
[09:50] inflation was that bad uh can you share
[09:52] some of those yeah I mean it really is
[09:55] the same any part of the world that has
[09:57] gone through this you could speak to
[09:59] somebody from Venezuela or Argentina and
[10:01] it just shows you as humans we're all
[10:03] the same same blood same experience you
[10:05] know for example Robin like you see a
[10:07] line and you you stand online because
[10:09] you don't know what they're selling but
[10:11] maybe it's it's something that is uh
[10:14] that must be worth it that's people are
[10:15] standing in line and there's also always
[10:18] the Dual standard so there will be one
[10:20] rate for the government that is the
[10:23] official rate and then there will be the
[10:25] the rate on the so-called you know under
[10:27] the table or the black market so you
[10:29] start seeing how everything gets
[10:31] distorted and and it really magnifies
[10:35] the um the canelon effect like who's
[10:38] closer to the money printer you start
[10:40] seeing it uh firsthand and and and you
[10:44] think it will never happen in the west
[10:46] but honestly I mean like I said we are
[10:48] all humans same blood same genetics same
[10:51] um uh experiences same psychology it
[10:54] could happen anywhere I mean we kind of
[10:56] already see the the beginnings of that
[10:58] uh with I think the the most of the
[11:00] money printing was in the the 2020 era
[11:03] and the more you print the more you have
[11:05] to print to make up for the printing and
[11:07] then you have to print more to make up
[11:09] for other printing so uh I feel like we
[11:12] we will come there it's just a question
[11:14] of of time so it's so interesting to
[11:16] hear those stories I just released I
[11:19] think today or yesterday a podcast with
[11:21] Ariel from uh Argentina and he talked
[11:24] about the history of the last like 50
[11:26] years in Argentina uh of of the money
[11:29] Printing and how often they exchanged
[11:32] the currency there was like currenc is
[11:34] only there for two years then they
[11:35] hyperinflated and they made up a new
[11:37] fiat currency then this one lasted four
[11:40] years then the next one lasted three
[11:41] years so like uh it's it's really
[11:44] interesting and sad to see those fat
[11:48] currency experiments played with
[11:50] people's life like there are Financial
[11:52] energies in there so that's I feel like
[11:56] why Bitcoin is so so important but I
[11:59] hav't another question um back to your
[12:01] psychology background for Bitcoin
[12:03] because we always have um this this
[12:05] thing like oh Bitcoin fixes did Bitcoin
[12:08] uh does that for Humanity um from a
[12:11] human
[12:12] standpoint what human problems does
[12:15] Bitcoin not solve like is it solving war
[12:19] is it not solving war is what human
[12:22] problems that do we have now that maybe
[12:24] the Bitcoin Community is like oh yeah
[12:27] Bitcoin fixes it but you think like um
[12:30] Bitcoin will not uh solve those kind of
[12:33] a problems yeah that's a yeah that's a
[12:35] very interesting point so so I mean
[12:37] Bitcoin will not fix the for example
[12:40] jealousy like if I am jealous of you and
[12:43] I probably should be jealous of you but
[12:45] but Bitcoin Bitcoin fixes Bitcoin fixes
[12:48] so many problems and it minimizes the
[12:52] the um the the effects the bad um
[12:56] feelings that somebody could have so
[12:58] Bitcoin will not fix jealousy Bitcoin
[13:00] will reduce violence but will not
[13:02] eliminate violence Bitcoin will reduce
[13:05] Distortion but it will take time until
[13:07] it fully gets established and adopted
[13:11] well that will happen so Bitcoin will
[13:13] not fix entirely human nature there will
[13:16] still be accidents there will still be
[13:18] acts based on jealousy and and and sin
[13:23] but but in many sense Bitcoin will make
[13:26] the higher reward on cooperation a on
[13:30] cooperation and that's very very
[13:32] important because this Bitcoin is the
[13:34] only asset that you know like it's a
[13:36] bare asset but I can I cannot you cannot
[13:39] take it from me I can decide to to to
[13:43] die and not have it go to you so so it's
[13:46] a different kind of asset I don't think
[13:48] Humanity ever had an asset like that
[13:50] because gold was physical and you could
[13:52] take it kill me and take it from me so
[13:55] Bitcoin is something very new it will
[13:56] not fix everything but it will a long
[13:59] long long way so that's why it's
[14:02] probably really hard to say how how
[14:04] Bitcoin will change uh humans as it's
[14:08] such a unique new thing
[14:11] right yeah like you know I I mean I in
[14:13] Psychology there's I one of my favorite
[14:15] um psychologist he he was born in the
[14:18] like the German Empire became became a
[14:20] US citizen like Eric Ericson Eric
[14:23] Ericson and he has a theory of the eight
[14:26] stages of human development and so and
[14:30] it's really a beautiful Theory and it's
[14:32] different phases in everybody's life of
[14:34] what they are going through from a
[14:36] toddler all the way to old age and so
[14:39] when you see somebody they're they're at
[14:41] that stage and they're looking for for
[14:44] example they're in the 20s their biggest
[14:46] concern is intimacy finding a partner
[14:49] you look at somebody my age and my 50s
[14:51] and it's more about generativity versus
[14:54] stagnation you look at somebody in their
[14:56] 80s and it's all about you know the did
[14:59] I live a wholesome life or did I regret
[15:03] something so even when a 2-year-old you
[15:05] know it's about independence versus so
[15:07] all these stages everybody will be at
[15:10] that stage and sometimes they have so
[15:12] much on their plate that they cannot
[15:14] think about Bitcoin they cannot make
[15:17] enough time to study Bitcoin or they
[15:20] maybe encounter Bitcoin but their ego is
[15:23] in the way they're not or like Michael
[15:25] sailor says they don't need to know so a
[15:29] lot of times people are in a well in a
[15:32] in a in a good Fiat position financially
[15:34] so they do not need to know Bitcoin but
[15:37] but at some point like Michael sailor
[15:38] says you know with with his company they
[15:41] got to a point where they have to know
[15:43] otherwise they would face a slow death
[15:45] as Michael sailor explains and I think
[15:47] you had him and you did a I mean your
[15:49] podcast with him was
[15:51] amazing yeah thank you so much yeah the
[15:54] one was really good it will take me a
[15:56] long time till another video will come
[15:59] to to that area of fuse and stuff like
[16:01] that I think the the the the marus saor
[16:04] interv interview was a was a really
[16:07] interesting one because I have never
[16:09] heard him talking talk about scaling
[16:12] Bitcoin so much so like that's an
[16:14] interesting one um maybe on on that note
[16:18] did Bitcoin also change your view on
[16:21] retirement and and saving money that you
[16:23] had before Bitcoin a different view on
[16:26] that yeah yeah absolutely I mean I was I
[16:30] was always a saver and so I always
[16:33] thought that I needed to have somebody
[16:35] to manage my money I needed to have
[16:37] somebody tell me what to buy and what to
[16:39] sell I needed to uh and that's why um I
[16:43] needed to have an active brokerage
[16:44] account and I needed to pay somebody 2%
[16:47] they paid they charged 2% to uh to
[16:50] manage the money and then and then I um
[16:54] I the more with the more I learned about
[16:56] Bitcoin the real the more I realized
[16:58] that lot of these jobs are really
[17:01] because of our broken Fiat money and
[17:04] that I can look back and say maybe this
[17:07] person is not adding value to to me I
[17:11] can just in the old days I can just buy
[17:14] gold and stash under the mattress but
[17:16] now it's even better I can buy Bitcoin
[17:18] and take it into self- custody in in a
[17:21] in a multi- cold wallet and so so that
[17:25] changed a lot for me Bitcoin on how I
[17:28] view
[17:30] so many jobs and so many position and so
[17:32] many Industries Robin that are just
[17:35] almost like zombie Industries they don't
[17:37] exist they don't really add value but
[17:40] they their only Advantage is they're
[17:41] close to the money printer and therefore
[17:44] they
[17:45] are making this inefficient system and
[17:48] once at a system that's more efficient
[17:50] 10x more efficient like Bitcoin a lot of
[17:53] these people will have to find new ways
[17:56] to add
[17:57] value yeah I I love that a lot and it
[18:01] also changes a lot when you I I I
[18:04] personally try to start counting in
[18:06] Bitcoin now when I think of like my net
[18:09] worth and I stopped counting in US
[18:12] dollars because US dollars are like oh
[18:14] yeah it's it's going up it's going down
[18:16] it's volatile and you feel really clever
[18:18] if like the Bitcoin price is up uh in US
[18:21] dollar terms and your net worth goes up
[18:23] but it's not reality but Bitcoin is
[18:26] reality and if I count my wealth in in
[18:29] Bitcoin it's it's way calmer like you
[18:33] you account like oh like there's that
[18:36] many Bitcoin more coming that money
[18:38] Bitcoin more coming like you you have a
[18:40] calmer more steady way of of uh getting
[18:44] uh more more of of of your net worth so
[18:47] I feel like if you start actually um
[18:51] accounting your like if you have Bitcoin
[18:55] as your store of value as your main
[18:56] store of value then you should also
[18:58] switch to like counting that as your
[19:01] unit of account in in for your long-term
[19:04] plans obviously it's really hard when
[19:05] you go to the supermarket and think in
[19:07] satoshis uh because you have to
[19:09] calculate a lot so I don't do that but
[19:12] when it comes to like net worth like why
[19:14] not count in Bitcoin why not count in
[19:16] satosi so that's that's something that I
[19:18] I try to do and it's uh something that
[19:21] calms you down uh and it's like oh y
[19:24] it's it's not that bad if like Bitcoin
[19:26] dips or Bitcoin it prices up like like
[19:29] who who cares like my Bitcoin is still
[19:30] my Bitcoin and I know the value what
[19:33] what it will be in 5 10 20 years like
[19:36] that that's one thing that I I I really
[19:39] got from from Bitcoin and it's it's
[19:40] really calm yeah yeah no absolutely like
[19:43] one I'm not GNA I'm I I mean it's you
[19:45] should never say how much Bitcoin you
[19:47] have or anyone or and and whatever you
[19:49] have to to compare is to this paare so
[19:51] just compare yourself to yourself and
[19:53] how much you had before and so I just
[19:55] try to add value every month I want to
[19:58] put more give more value to society
[20:00] through my job and my earnings and so
[20:03] that I have more satoshis at the end but
[20:06] like I I I like I'm I want to become for
[20:08] example a Satoshi billionaire and you
[20:10] know if you do the math a Satoshi
[20:12] billionaire that's a number you know 10
[20:14] Bitcoins for example but that's that's a
[20:16] great goal or you can have a goal of
[20:18] becoming a whole coiner that's a great
[20:20] goal and even much less than that that
[20:22] is still a fine goal and to add to what
[20:25] you were saying Robin I mean you know
[20:27] you have it's good to have multiple
[20:30] Stacks multiple bags so to speak and so
[20:34] for example if I have a stack that I I'm
[20:36] stored in retirement for long term or
[20:39] for my to give to my daughter or and and
[20:43] and my after my life then I don't care
[20:46] about that it's a number of Bitcoins and
[20:47] that's that's gone I don't need to check
[20:49] how much it is in Fiat it's just in my
[20:52] mind it's a number and then and then the
[20:54] stash that I'm DCA you know adding every
[20:57] paycheck to
[20:59] well I don't care if like you said if
[21:01] you're measure it in in in Satoshi and
[21:03] Bitcoins then you just see a number
[21:05] going up every two weeks when you get
[21:07] paid and and and you feel you honestly
[21:09] feel much more Zen and this was
[21:12] something that I noticed with a lot of
[21:13] bitcoiners the older the longer they
[21:15] have in they are in Bitcoin the more Zen
[21:18] that they are honestly I mean a lot of
[21:20] guests that you have and because like I
[21:22] think it has to do with what you were
[21:23] saying they measure their wealth in
[21:25] Bitcoin and they think long term yeah
[21:27] and I think uh the point that you
[21:29] brought up in the beginning is is an
[21:31] amazing one because you you should have
[21:34] the the highest possible goal uh in in
[21:38] in Bitcoin terms uh but remembering that
[21:42] even a small amount of Bitcoin will be a
[21:44] significant amount of of of wealth long
[21:48] term uh so if we come back to like okay
[21:51] how many Bitcoin should you accumulate a
[21:53] question that is actually asked a lot in
[21:55] the Bitcoin Community there's like
[21:57] always this gold post move moving like a
[21:59] few years ago it was like oh come to
[22:01] 6.125 bitcoin then a few years back it
[22:04] was like oh come to one Bitcoin now I
[22:07] feel like the the new goal post is like
[22:09] get to 0.1 Bitcoin uh because that will
[22:12] be a significantly amount of of wealth
[22:16] uh they're even theous of like
[22:18] retiring on 0.1 Bitcoin uh on uh when
[22:23] when you're like in in 10 years time or
[22:25] 15 years time depending on on your
[22:27] expenses and where you live and and if
[22:29] you have to feed a family of course
[22:30] there a lot of factors involved in that
[22:32] but it's the significance of of just a
[22:35] small amount of Bitcoin in a
[22:37] hyperinflated fe currency world I think
[22:39] a lot of people don't really uh um give
[22:42] this enough credit yeah no I agree Robin
[22:46] and also I I think Bitcoin makes you
[22:49] more frugal you know a while back there
[22:51] was the whole minimalist movement of how
[22:54] become you become happier when you are
[22:56] more of a minimalist and there is there
[22:58] was some virtue there but but but
[23:00] Bitcoin really gives you why um why you
[23:05] when you become Frugal and you save
[23:07] things in Bitcoin and you you really ask
[23:10] yourself before you buy anything do I
[23:12] really need this and is this really
[23:14] valuable and so and I joke that when I
[23:16] see things I don't need I just see them
[23:18] as less Bitcoin I see oh all this is
[23:21] this is a new motorcycle whatever this
[23:23] is a new car oh that's just less Bitcoin
[23:25] you know if it's not going to add value
[23:27] or change my life or my family and and
[23:30] i' I'd rather get more Bitcoin and so it
[23:34] really does help and you realize that
[23:36] there's so much stuff that you have that
[23:38] you really don't need and you're buying
[23:40] plastic and you're getting it shipped
[23:42] from you know all over the world China
[23:44] or wherever and it's you you are you you
[23:47] do live a better
[23:49] lighter life more minimalist but happier
[23:52] with Bitcoin more experiences what would
[23:54] you say is the most uh fascinating thing
[23:57] that you discovered within
[24:00] Bitcoin so I have to admit that when I
[24:03] grew up I grew up in a in a in a
[24:06] conservative Muslim country and I
[24:08] learned and and and I mean being
[24:10] Christian I like we still learned we
[24:12] studied all the religions Judaism we we
[24:15] studied all the religions and the one
[24:16] thing that I never understood until I
[24:18] learned about Bitcoin Robin is I always
[24:21] UND I always I always I was always told
[24:24] that compound interest or Usery is a sin
[24:28] it's one of the cardinal sins in Islam
[24:31] it's a it's a huge sin it's more than
[24:33] eating pork or drinking alcohol or
[24:36] committing adultery or but like but I
[24:38] never but but then when I you know I
[24:40] learned mathematics I study and it's
[24:42] also in the Bible and the same thing and
[24:44] changing of weights and measures and
[24:46] cheating with weights and measures and
[24:48] and the story of Jesus Christ going with
[24:50] the whip and breaking the the money
[24:52] changer stable in the father's Temple I
[24:54] mean I that was always something we
[24:57] studied and even in Judaism that you you
[24:59] do not charge usually to your family
[25:02] members so I that was in the back of my
[25:04] mind but I always thought it was
[25:06] backwards I thought oh my goodness like
[25:08] this is these religions they don't know
[25:10] what they're talking about because it's
[25:11] just math and compound interest and but
[25:15] honestly I was humbled to realize that
[25:17] there is ancient wisdom in in what these
[25:20] ancient religions are were trying to
[25:23] tell us and that if and that and that a
[25:27] lot of what we see today is is is is a
[25:32] result of broken money of Fiat money
[25:34] where money has to debase the currency
[25:37] has to debase and you have to charge
[25:40] interest and and and that is not
[25:43] necessarily um natural in in hard money
[25:47] I mean it feels natural because we've
[25:48] been living in it for maybe I mean
[25:50] people say 1971 I argue that it's
[25:53] probably even before that maybe and you
[25:56] know in the United States we can AR it
[25:58] goes back to
[26:00] 1913 so so that was one of the biggest
[26:02] things about Bitcoin I know I it's not a
[26:04] con controversial subject really I just
[26:07] think that there is more wisdom even if
[26:10] you're not religious there is more
[26:12] beautiful wisdom in the old you know
[26:15] abrahamic religions about money and
[26:17] about why usury is not good and and that
[26:22] we should be humble to listen to it even
[26:24] if we are secular people it's so it's so
[26:26] interesting the connection to religion
[26:29] um we even made like some some episodes
[26:31] around that with with Pastor coin and
[26:33] and it's really interesting to go
[26:34] through and one thing that I really also
[26:36] want to get into this episode as you
[26:38] have also math background uh and I think
[26:42] I don't know I think we discussed it
[26:44] really briefly uh on on a Satoshi
[26:46] hangout uh that we were on um the
[26:49] Bitcoin power law you you have like a
[26:52] math background I don't know if you saw
[26:54] the episodes where where I discussed
[26:56] with with different people the the Paulo
[26:58] um what what's your take on on the
[27:00] Bitcoin power law and and do you see it
[27:02] as as a as a good form of predicting the
[27:05] growth of Bitcoin yeah that's a really
[27:09] good question I spent a lot of time
[27:10] thinking about it and and listening to
[27:12] people and so the the idea there is that
[27:15] is it valid so the question is is the
[27:17] power law valid well in Psychology in in
[27:21] measurement and evaluation the the
[27:23] concept of validity what is valid like
[27:26] is a test valid is a measurement valid
[27:28] is a scale valid technically there are
[27:31] six or seven types of validity so if you
[27:35] Google for example types of validity
[27:37] psychology if you Google you will see a
[27:39] list of six or seven of them like you
[27:41] know content validity face validity
[27:43] partic predictive validity um convergent
[27:46] validity discriminate validity and all
[27:49] these are Concepts that you can say one
[27:51] by one does it have this type of
[27:54] validity or not so I so technically when
[27:58] you look at the formula the power law I
[28:00] argue that yes it has a little bit of
[28:02] every one of these types of validity
[28:05] however there's a however however there
[28:07] are two things one thing is it
[28:09] technically when in in Psychology it's
[28:12] not whether the test itself is valid or
[28:15] not valid the judgment is about every
[28:19] person's
[28:20] interpretation of the test is that valid
[28:24] or is not valid so it's not the test
[28:25] that we argue or worry about is it valid
[28:28] or not valid because it has all these
[28:30] types of validity on face on content on
[28:33] predictive on convergent UND
[28:34] discriminate we worry about is my is
[28:38] every different
[28:40] interpretation valid or not valid so
[28:42] I'll give you an example I can come to
[28:44] the power law and say you know Robin
[28:46] based on my interpretation of the power
[28:48] law I'm G to buy and hold and never
[28:51] trade that's my interpretation somebody
[28:54] else might come and say you know based
[28:55] on my their interpretation they're going
[28:58] to time the market and and and sell at
[29:01] the high and buy it back at the low and
[29:03] so on so technically it's my we can
[29:06] argue whether my interpretation is valid
[29:09] or not for me we can argue whether their
[29:11] interpretation is valid or not for them
[29:13] but the test itself it has the basic six
[29:17] or seven enough of the six or seven
[29:19] validities but we worry more about every
[29:22] person's interpretation because maybe my
[29:25] interpretation will be not good for me
[29:27] maybe my interpretation would be you
[29:28] know lacking for other somebody else so
[29:31] it's a very fluid subject I know I I
[29:34] feel like I'm dancing I know like or or
[29:36] or wimping out of the question or like
[29:39] you know like a politician but really
[29:41] this is this is truly the way of how we
[29:44] think about it in terms of psychology
[29:46] and measurement and evaluation the last
[29:48] the last point I just say is also the
[29:51] word sometimes gives people a a hangup
[29:55] like whether you call it a law or a
[29:57] formula
[29:58] or an equation or a regression I mean
[30:02] sometimes the people see the word law
[30:04] and they think it's that it's
[30:06] deterministic but they don't realize
[30:08] that there's so much more even in a
[30:10] model there's so much room for noise and
[30:15] and Randomness and so and you know
[30:17] honestly Robin like I'm the first to
[30:19] tell you I mean math humbles you and
[30:22] making a prediction humbles you because
[30:24] you you will realize there's so much
[30:26] that we cannot account for we cannot
[30:28] account for a nation adopting a
[30:31] strategic Reserve we cannot account for
[30:32] a big company making it a treasury asset
[30:35] we cannot account for um things that are
[30:40] that will like like like Michael saor
[30:43] would say Godzilla enters into the
[30:45] playground I don't did I answer it I
[30:47] feel like I danced a lot and I just it's
[30:49] not easy to answer I think uh it's it's
[30:53] it's one of the best explanations that I
[30:55] heard around if the Bitcoin law is valid
[30:59] I love that explanation and it's
[31:01] interesting when I think about it
[31:03] because as you said that's the only
[31:05] problem that I have with the Bitcoin
[31:06] Power log um when we take it as
[31:09] something to uh model a growth plan of
[31:15] the of the past uh on on bitcoin and
[31:18] maybe having a normal based case of
[31:21] projection in the future maybe not
[31:24] against dollar but even against uh gold
[31:28] that's the most interesting for me
[31:31] because against the dollar I feel like
[31:34] dollar can hyper inflate uh this year
[31:37] can happen flate next year if there's
[31:40] something weird happening so I don't
[31:42] know if we should ever use such a model
[31:45] uh to begin with where the dollar is the
[31:48] underlying asset so that's why I like um
[31:52] when Stephen was on my show uh and he
[31:54] showed me the power law of Bitcoin where
[31:57] we don't uh do it against the dollar but
[32:00] against gold something way more
[32:02] interesting because then you can maybe
[32:05] actually account for those good Zilla
[32:07] moments where maybe a hyperinflation
[32:10] happens in the USA But in a
[32:13] hyperinflation also gold will rise a lot
[32:16] but Bitcoin will rise faster and the
[32:18] adoption of Bitcoin will rise faster so
[32:20] I feel like that's my most favorite
[32:23] Bitcoin power L but even if we take the
[32:26] gold one there still the case of uh
[32:30] maybe central banks discover tomorrow oh
[32:33] like oh gold is is not there like gold
[32:36] is not as popular anymore and young
[32:38] people don't care about gold and oh we
[32:40] we we maybe should buy Bitcoin now uh
[32:43] and maybe um central banks start slowly
[32:46] selling gold and slowly buying Bitcoin
[32:49] what will that do to that craft if if uh
[32:52] the the Federal Reserve for example
[32:54] decides to do that so it doesn't account
[32:57] for those crazy outbreaks that are maybe
[33:02] not realistic but possible so that that
[33:06] that's my only problem if you try to
[33:09] sell a power law as if it's like oh take
[33:13] this and with that you can uh uh trade
[33:17] your Bitcoin or you have a weighted DCA
[33:20] plan or something like that no just like
[33:22] DCA what you feel comfortable with
[33:24] because you don't know what happens if
[33:26] you take because of the Bitcoin power
[33:28] the Bitcoin power says like oh we are
[33:30] now in a in a a little bit of a bubble
[33:33] area trade some Bitcoin off get in some
[33:36] cash what if that is the point of
[33:39] hyperinflation what if that is the point
[33:41] where Bitcoin goes parabolic up and you
[33:43] will never be able to buy back those
[33:45] Bitcoin in your life like that's why I'm
[33:49] skeptical but I love that we put math uh
[33:54] in into this question of um how bitco
[33:57] will grow and I also saw that um the
[34:02] Michael sailor model of predicting the
[34:05] Bitcoin price is actually quite similar
[34:08] than the Bitcoin power law I saw that
[34:10] the the base case of Micha not the bull
[34:13] case or not the barcas but the base case
[34:15] of I think $ 30 million Us in
[34:20] 2045 uh it was um is quite uh similar to
[34:24] the Bitcoin power law uh um so it's it's
[34:28] interesting for me that like there there
[34:30] are different people coming with
[34:32] different models to an similar
[34:35] conclusion um and uh they they kind of
[34:38] come there the only thing is it's like I
[34:40] have a hard time thinking of inflation
[34:43] being so low I have a hard time thinking
[34:46] that till
[34:47] 2049 we will not we will still have a US
[34:51] dollar that is accurately uh displaying
[34:55] today's wealth so I don't know what if
[34:57] if Bitcoin is 13 million US dollar in in
[35:02] 2045 probably uh the US dollars is
[35:05] really strong otherwise Bitcoin is
[35:07] probably way higher than that because
[35:09] inflation will be will be massive so
[35:12] it's it's an interesting topic I also
[35:14] dance around that that topic a little
[35:16] bit uh because I I I cannot really say
[35:19] it's not valid I don't like it I hate it
[35:21] or something like that but also I'm
[35:23] really cautious about the possible
[35:25] outcomes especially with new people that
[35:28] hear a a nice story and there are some
[35:31] uh really intelligent people behind that
[35:34] and then saying oh it's very valid and
[35:35] it's very good to PO and then they maybe
[35:38] make the mistake on trading on it and
[35:41] then they get wrecked so like that's
[35:42] what I really try to always bring up and
[35:45] say like oh be cautious like don't sell
[35:48] your Bitcoin it's not a good at Choice
[35:50] yeah no I agree I agree and and honestly
[35:53] Robin like even in math and we tell
[35:54] ourselves always it's sometimes it's
[35:56] more important to be direct
[35:57] directionally correct sometimes it's
[36:00] even enough to be directionally correct
[36:03] than it is to be exact you know you
[36:05] don't have to necessarily hit the
[36:07] bullseye but if you're hitting in the
[36:09] direction Target of the direction of the
[36:12] target you are good enough compared to
[36:15] what else you could be doing you could
[36:16] be shorting it you could be not buying
[36:18] it at all and not getting involved you
[36:20] know boycotting yourself from Bitcoin so
[36:24] that so just to be directionally correct
[36:25] I think that would be very very
[36:27] rewarding uh that's that's definitely
[36:30] something I find um and you don't and we
[36:32] can maybe intellectually try to practice
[36:35] math and models I like the stock to flow
[36:37] model conceptually I think that's that's
[36:39] beautiful as well even though but but
[36:42] like you said you it's like and like I
[36:44] was telling you it's not the model
[36:46] itself because that also has enough of
[36:48] the valid the six or seven validity
[36:50] Concepts or attributes it's really every
[36:53] personals interpretation we can argue
[36:55] whether that's valid or not valid
[36:58] the other thing also like in the just to
[37:00] follow up on the just to be in the
[37:02] direction and not necessarily to be
[37:05] accurate I just for example I say gold
[37:08] and I I'm sure I'm not the first one who
[37:09] said this in fact so much in Bitcoin we
[37:12] read and we listen to so many people so
[37:14] I don't want I want to make sure I'm not
[37:15] I'm always giving credit when I say
[37:17] something um and if I don't remember I'm
[37:20] sure somebody else said it but Bitcoin
[37:22] as a as a monetary asset is far superior
[37:25] to me than gold you know it's I can for
[37:28] so many reasons I mean and and it's more
[37:31] like 10x better than gold and so to me I
[37:35] think that Bitcoin exchange rate and I
[37:38] ha I hesitate even to say price but
[37:40] Bitcoin exchange rate to the US dollar I
[37:43] mean until reaches until Bitcoin reaches
[37:46] the market cap the valuation of gold
[37:48] maybe even 10 times gold I think of it
[37:51] as
[37:52] undervalued so I don't know I mean I I
[37:55] can't think of anything more bullish
[37:56] than that even though I'm not being
[37:58] exact I'm just I I just feel that that's
[38:01] the direction and like you said like you
[38:03] said earlier I I I was listening even
[38:05] even gold May appreciate so those that
[38:07] the valuation of gold is itself is a
[38:09] moving Target if you watch my podcast
[38:11] already for more than two times you know
[38:13] how extremely passionate I am about
[38:16] self- custody and the first very very
[38:20] very important step to self- cust is
[38:23] always getting yourself a hardware
[38:26] wallet and I have one for you here this
[38:28] is the Bitcoin only Edition from the
[38:30] bitbox my favorite single signature
[38:33] Hardware wallet on the market another
[38:36] really important piece of self- custody
[38:39] if you have a hardware wallet is the
[38:41] backup of the seat phrase and bitbox
[38:44] made the perfect solution to back up
[38:46] your seat phrase they made a reusable
[38:49] steel wallet check out that beauty it's
[38:52] durable and extremely heavy if I put it
[38:55] on the desk I seriously fear for my own
[38:59] table it's so so heavy and durable I
[39:02] love it this is where my seed phrase is
[39:05] secure go to bitbox
[39:07] do/ robobin to get your bitbox and if
[39:11] you use code Robin you even get 5% off
[39:16] of your complete order and the next step
[39:18] is to really level up your sovereignty
[39:21] as an individual you have to have the
[39:23] most secure self custody setup you have
[39:26] to secure your own devices you have to
[39:29] protect your privacy you have to set up
[39:32] an inheritance plan and depending on
[39:34] where you live you even want to have a
[39:37] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[39:40] in case something goes really really
[39:41] wrong and through all those steps the
[39:43] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[39:46] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[39:49] way.com
[39:50] Partners SL robobin you even get a 30
[39:53] minute free call to find out how you can
[39:56] level up your sovereignty and last but
[39:59] not least I have something completely
[40:01] new for you guys I partnered up with
[40:05] coin vigilante this is the most
[40:07] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[40:10] saw created by anyone look at that
[40:13] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[40:16] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[40:19] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[40:22] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[40:24] and that watch brand is Bitcoin Co only
[40:28] and coin vigilante just dropped a
[40:30] completely new and amazing Genesis
[40:33] edition of their watch collections you
[40:36] have the date of the first ever mined
[40:39] Bitcoin Block in there and of course
[40:41] also the block height and which EPO we
[40:44] are currently in I love the level of
[40:47] detail they put in in this masterpiece
[40:50] and make sure to check out those amazing
[40:53] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[40:56] descriptions I love those watches so so
[40:59] much yeah absolutely and it's it's
[41:02] that's why I like the I bring it a lot
[41:04] up in in the the past episode I feel
[41:06] like Jesse Meers model uh around um
[41:11] there's a total net Assets in the world
[41:15] and then it's just a question of how
[41:17] much of those total net assets will
[41:20] Bitcoin subsume uh and then it doesn't
[41:23] come a question of what is the exact
[41:25] price but what is the percentage of
[41:27] Bitcoin capturing from the total net uh
[41:31] not total net net wealth uh and then we
[41:35] can measure it in today's taller terms
[41:38] and then just add up inflation or that
[41:40] but inflation doesn't matter anyway so
[41:42] you can just like say like oh if if
[41:44] Bitcoin for example subsumes uh around
[41:48] uh 85% of and that's the most bullish
[41:51] case for me 85% of the total net we
[41:55] wealth then 0 one Bitcoin will be5
[41:58] million usar in today's purchasing
[42:02] Powers dollars terms so that's an
[42:04] interesting model to think of like
[42:06] that's like if the most bullish case
[42:09] comes to uh reality in Bitcoin with like
[42:13] around 85% of the total wealth being in
[42:17] Bitcoin then we can kind of consume okay
[42:20] if you have 0.1 Bitcoin today that might
[42:23] be when this case reaches at that time 5
[42:27] million us right now and that's an
[42:30] interesting model to think of uh by the
[42:32] way it's also like two Sates are then $1
[42:36] uh so not even in that like a lot of
[42:38] people talk about dollar and um uh bitco
[42:43] parity but in that that thing it does
[42:46] not even happen in the most bullish case
[42:49] it only happens if we have
[42:50] hyperinflation of the US dollar but just
[42:52] from that perspective I think Bitcoin
[42:55] will not reach that parity unless the US
[42:57] dollar hyp inflates which is very likely
[43:00] so pricing models are always interesting
[43:03] and and different people come to
[43:04] different conclusions but the the moment
[43:07] you put a time frame on that is really
[43:10] hard because my model with like this 85%
[43:14] nobody can attack me because I don't put
[43:16] a time frame on it I don't say like 2050
[43:19] or 21 or 2060 or 2020 I don't know uh8
[43:24] or something like that um because that's
[43:27] really hard to predict I might be able
[43:30] to put up a model and say like oh there
[43:32] we probably go but the time frame is
[43:34] really complicated to to put on on on
[43:37] such a such a question so I I love that
[43:40] you also as a as a g gave us your
[43:43] insights as someone who studied
[43:46] MAF yeah yeah and Bitcoin remember
[43:49] Bitcoin is going to give us the two
[43:50] separations that uh Parker Lewis talks
[43:53] about and I love it everyone says you
[43:55] know separate money from State and
[43:57] that's wonderful that's that's the
[43:59] beginning but Parker Lewis in his book
[44:01] gradually then suddenly I mean uh I mean
[44:04] he also talks about the second
[44:05] separation which is separate money from
[44:08] Banks and and that sounds
[44:10] counterintuitive but he explains it and
[44:13] he says you know once you have you know
[44:16] instead of the he gives the diagram of
[44:18] in the center of the circle there's the
[44:20] the money printer in Fiat and then
[44:22] outside is the you know so that's the
[44:25] central bank and then outside the ring
[44:27] outside it is the um commercial big
[44:31] commercial Banks and then it's the small
[44:33] Regional Banks and basically Banks would
[44:37] still be there they would still offer
[44:39] Financial Services they would still give
[44:41] you advice but they will be on equal
[44:44] footing with you competing for Capital
[44:49] they will not just get the capital
[44:51] automatically with no proof of work with
[44:54] just a stroke of a keyboard from the
[44:56] central bank Bank through the Commercial
[44:58] Bank you know I mean and so they will be
[45:01] equal footing so they will have to
[45:02] basically they'll go they almost they'll
[45:04] go back to full Reserve banking which
[45:06] will be more sound less bailouts so some
[45:10] of these things we cannot predict we
[45:12] know that they will add more value to
[45:14] society and and and more productivity
[45:17] and so things will be cheaper and so
[45:19] maybe we can survive on even less SATs
[45:22] and so like you were saying even a
[45:23] smaller number of SATs will be a a
[45:26] significant
[45:27] Fortune because because money will be
[45:30] more sound that's very important that's
[45:33] hard to predict we cannot it's very hard
[45:35] to predict human Innovation I love that
[45:38] the eight billion people in the world
[45:40] and so many of them are smarter than me
[45:41] because that means my life is getting
[45:43] better when I'm on a Bitcoin standard so
[45:45] so Bitcoin eliminates reduces my
[45:48] jealousy reduces my um anxiety you know
[45:52] makes me realize that anything good that
[45:54] happens in the world and a new invention
[45:57] in India in China in Africa anywhere in
[46:00] Europe anywhere it's going to benefit me
[46:02] and I think that's why like when Jack
[46:04] MERS says U I think even you say it like
[46:08] U like uh Larry think works for me
[46:11] everybody in Bitcoin works for me and I
[46:13] I do see it I do see it because people
[46:16] will become more Sovereign more free and
[46:19] that's hard to model in any in any
[46:21] mathematical model that's that's a a
[46:23] really great point that everyone is
[46:25] working for you like Michael S working
[46:27] for you you are working for me I work
[46:29] for you and the the concept of that is
[46:32] extremely underrated I feel like because
[46:35] when you then come to a point where for
[46:38] example there's someone that reinvents
[46:41] cameras and all of the sudden cameras
[46:43] are way smaller way cheaper and everyone
[46:46] can have cameras because they just don't
[46:48] cost like I have now a YouTube camera
[46:51] there I think it was around like 800
[46:53] 9900 with the lens and everything uh so
[46:56] that's quite expensive but if you then
[46:59] go and there someone is like oh I
[47:02] revolutionized how we make cameras and
[47:04] they are way better than the Thousand
[47:06] Euro cameras and they they just cost 100
[47:09] EUR that benefits him a lot but it also
[47:13] benefits everyone else because everyone
[47:17] else gets that cheaper electronic and we
[47:20] get more productive uh and that's that's
[47:23] an that's something that we don't
[47:25] realize what Bitcoin will do because
[47:27] right now we have so many different uh
[47:30] currencies we have so many different J
[47:32] jurisdictions and central banks that
[47:34] when someone in the US does something
[47:36] really great this benefits the people in
[47:39] the US and not as many as the whole
[47:41] society but if everyone is on the same
[47:43] money standard it benefits everyone and
[47:46] that's something uh truly amazing and
[47:49] maybe like people would ask like okay
[47:52] why is it benefiting everyone because
[47:54] the person is saving in Bitcoin because
[47:57] everyone is saving in Bitcoin that's the
[47:59] major thing what what do you want to add
[48:01] exactly no no exactly exactly and that's
[48:03] where we have to be very humble to
[48:05] realize that it's actually very
[48:07] difficult to make a financial model so
[48:09] whoever comes up with a financial model
[48:11] you know give them a hug I mean it's not
[48:12] easy to to to come up with one and to
[48:16] account for all these um Concepts and
[48:19] and all these events that we can't
[48:21] really uh factors that we cannot really
[48:23] sometimes think of how has uh Bitcoin
[48:27] uh made change in in in your personal
[48:30] life in your family life in in your um
[48:34] Financial life what did Bitcoin change
[48:36] in you or uh change for you yeah no I
[48:40] mean I'm gonna be honest Robin I'm gonna
[48:42] tell you like you know Bitcoin took many
[48:44] touch points for me it wasn't like I
[48:47] mean and I maybe I'm a little bit on the
[48:50] slow side maybe it takes me longer but
[48:53] but it took me about you know like like
[48:55] almost like 5 years just from from the
[48:58] first time thinking about it reading it
[49:01] then buying it and then selling it
[49:03] because I thought it was just you know
[49:05] like a like a like a tech stock and then
[49:09] then then I start you know okay here put
[49:11] a percentage of your netw worth and then
[49:13] go all in and and then minimize and try
[49:17] to go all in but it it takes it takes
[49:19] longer but I'm going to admit it's not
[49:22] always easy and and that's why we are
[49:26] I'm not going to say we are like like
[49:28] the original ogs of Bitcoin we are not
[49:31] they are amazing they were there first
[49:33] and I honor them I love them I respect
[49:35] what they've been through but on a micro
[49:38] scale honestly Robin we've also I mean
[49:41] people who are in Bitcoin for a year
[49:43] people who are in Bitcoin for two years
[49:45] really even people who just got into
[49:47] Bitcoin a few months ago like we are on
[49:50] a journey that is on a smaller scale
[49:54] much like that journey of the of the ogs
[49:58] of The Originals of of of of Bitcoin
[50:01] because because not everybody will
[50:05] understand I mean we are here and we
[50:08] understand each other but for the rest
[50:10] of the world Robin we are so early my
[50:13] family thinks I'm crazy my family thinks
[50:16] I lost my mind they think I'm going to
[50:18] burn myself even though what I believe
[50:21] what they're that that that I'm doing
[50:23] something that is even more conservative
[50:25] than more safe
[50:27] than you know I mean I like the reason
[50:30] honestly Robin there's a lot of what I
[50:32] call I it's not my term I've heard this
[50:34] term and it stuck with me I honestly
[50:36] don't remember who said it maybe you can
[50:37] help me crypto
[50:40] confusion a lot of people go
[50:43] ahead I think I never really heard it
[50:46] but I don't know who from who it is
[50:48] maybe maybe it's uh from from someone
[50:51] that was already on my podcast but I I
[50:53] don't I I didn't I never heard it
[50:55] actually confusion it's basically the
[50:58] the confusion the confounding the mixing
[51:01] of where where they don't know the
[51:02] difference between Bitcoin and crypto or
[51:05] Bitcoin and gambling Bitcoin and you
[51:09] know like degenerate Behavior where
[51:12] addictive behavior where you go and you
[51:15] try to overcompensate for something
[51:18] missing in your life so you you you know
[51:21] we are I mean my family I love my family
[51:24] it's you know they're coming around they
[51:26] love me they still think I'm crazy but
[51:29] but I I go back with love and I I I just
[51:32] give them time because because in the
[51:36] end everybody has their own time I was
[51:38] able to bit to orange pill um a few of
[51:42] my friends some of some some in my
[51:43] family but not everyone I mean not even
[51:46] not even a you know like a very very
[51:49] small minority that I was able to truly
[51:51] Bitcoin but so it's to to orange pill
[51:54] but it it is a journey and I'm saying
[51:56] it's it's not all roses and Flowery
[51:59] Journey it is really a humbling Journey
[52:02] it's it could be there's a lot of
[52:04] introspection you're looking at yourself
[52:07] you're looking at your history you're
[52:08] looking it's almost like like you become
[52:10] your own therapist but but in the end
[52:13] it's it's really worth it it's really
[52:15] really worth it and and I think time
[52:18] will prove me right and I haven't done
[52:21] anything that I would regret I still
[52:23] love my family I'm still but but and and
[52:26] I think even when they are worried for
[52:27] me Robin I think it's coming from love
[52:30] they love me you know they they love me
[52:32] so it's coming from from worried from
[52:35] them worried again because they have
[52:36] crypto confusion they think oh Bitcoin
[52:38] that must be um I don't know FTX or you
[52:42] know it's the same thing so you just
[52:44] have to slowly with love you know in in
[52:47] um in Psychology there's the famous
[52:49] psychologist p and he has the
[52:51] constructivist model of learning of
[52:53] teaching it's basically like you know
[52:56] it's not direct instruction I don't just
[52:58] come in and say I'm the teacher and this
[53:00] is how we do it one two three that's
[53:03] direct instruction sometimes that's okay
[53:06] but it's not for always um there's
[53:09] another method where you know it's
[53:11] Discovery I just give you an open-ended
[53:13] prompt and here's the problem I'm the
[53:15] teacher and you're the student and then
[53:16] you try to just kind of you know like a
[53:19] journey like a Discovery Education those
[53:22] are the two extremes but P says well
[53:24] there's something in the Middle where
[53:26] you it's constructivist approach you see
[53:29] where everybody is and you see it's in
[53:32] the middle it's not direct instruction
[53:35] and it's not open Discovery it's
[53:38] basically in the middle you see where
[53:39] somebody is at and you look at their
[53:41] house of knowledge almost like a house
[53:44] Brick by Brick in their mind and then
[53:47] you try to give them just that one brick
[53:49] that you think will fit into their house
[53:52] of knowledge and you have to give them
[53:54] that brick in a nice way in a nice
[53:57] manner in a nice some that is validating
[54:00] to them that helps them and then they
[54:01] have to collect that brick and literally
[54:03] put it I mean not literally figuratively
[54:06] and put it in their house of knowledge
[54:08] and so so a lot of times if you are with
[54:10] your family and I mean not you but like
[54:12] if anyone else is listening is with
[54:14] their family and they're struggling
[54:16] to realize it's normal it's going to
[54:19] take time and eventually we will be I'm
[54:22] not going to say proven right I mean but
[54:24] it gets better with time and people just
[54:28] have to be on their journey to
[54:30] to to get there they will catch up to
[54:32] you it's just never say anything that
[54:35] you will regret always spread
[54:39] love and I think that's really hard I
[54:42] think uh you're 100% right and uh not
[54:46] coming back to what Michael saor
[54:48] actually said in my interview again
[54:50] spread Bitcoin with love and not with
[54:52] hate like be being respectful and uh
[54:56] being someone that spreads it always
[54:58] with love and not like hatred so that's
[55:01] really really really really important um
[55:05] but I get what a lot of people also in
[55:07] the comments and when I talk with them
[55:09] say when they're like oh but it's so
[55:12] frustrating that people don't get it
[55:15] they they have in their minds like I
[55:17] told him about Bitcoin when it was 5,000
[55:20] I told him when it was about 20,000 now
[55:22] it's it dips to 50,000 and I told him
[55:25] again
[55:26] uh and and it's like it's already 10x
[55:31] from where I told the first guy to like
[55:34] that like or people say like oh already
[55:37] 20x since I told you about it when will
[55:39] you learn so some maybe have this moment
[55:43] in the head like when they finally come
[55:45] to like oh I get it now sorry that like
[55:48] I think that's actually something where
[55:50] where bitcoiners struggle with uh where
[55:54] they are the only one in the family that
[55:58] really get Bitcoin and then they they
[56:01] want to prove everyone uh right they
[56:04] want oh they want to prove everyone
[56:06] wrong they're like hey Bitcoin is this
[56:08] thing and the price thing becomes that
[56:11] that one measurement where they can
[56:14] prove them wrong or they say like oh
[56:16] there's this one billionaire that is now
[56:19] in Bitcoin and send them the videos like
[56:21] those kind of things um and how I deal
[56:24] dealt with that maybe if maybe it's
[56:26] interesting for for people to know how
[56:28] how how we deal with that or how I dealt
[56:30] with that I went full on in the internet
[56:34] world and searched for people that got
[56:36] it so I can let my talking power of
[56:40] Bitcoin onto people that actually care
[56:43] about that and the people that I care
[56:45] about in my personal life I don't bother
[56:48] them with my Bitcoin talk so so that was
[56:50] really that was therapeutic for me that
[56:52] was really good to find real people on
[56:56] the internet that I can talk to in
[56:58] Bitcoin so that was kind of the start to
[57:01] where I'm right now because now honestly
[57:04] um I don't talk about Bitcoin with my
[57:08] girlfriend almost ever like we talk
[57:11] about it maybe every third or fourth day
[57:15] oh Bitcoin is dead and she's also the
[57:17] the girlfriend of a bitcoiner in her
[57:19] work so like work colleagues of hers
[57:22] even though I was never in the workplace
[57:23] come to her and say like oh what's
[57:25] Bitcoin doing and she's like I actually
[57:27] don't know like I just have a Bitcoin as
[57:30] a as a boyfriend uh so um I I like the
[57:34] position that I'm right now in I can
[57:36] talk with so many people about Bitcoin
[57:38] uh and my Bitcoin talking power is is is
[57:42] there somewhere but at the same time I
[57:44] don't have to bother my family with it
[57:47] but every once in a while someone from
[57:49] my family comes here and says like hey
[57:51] Robin you you make Bitcoin content how's
[57:53] that about Bitcoin or or how does this
[57:55] work or where do I buy it or or I heard
[57:58] that thing what's bad for Bitcoin is
[58:00] that true like I love that because I
[58:04] don't tell them to buy Bitcoin I just um
[58:08] I see myself like as a math teacher I
[58:11] see myself as a teacher that has just
[58:13] like some some subject it could be math
[58:16] it could be history it could be anything
[58:18] and with Bitcoin there all those
[58:20] subjects in there anyways uh so they
[58:22] come to me and I don't try to like oh
[58:24] yeah Bitcoin is the thing you should get
[58:26] get into it no like uh they ask me a
[58:28] question like oh how is that uh how will
[58:31] uh how how does Bitcoin make sure that
[58:33] transaction are safe then I explain them
[58:36] how transaction are safe and how
[58:37] transaction are working in Bitcoin so I
[58:40] switch completely in my head from making
[58:44] people understand Bitcoin to teaching
[58:46] them about their question that they have
[58:49] about Bitcoin because they see it so
[58:51] many times in the news they will come
[58:53] anyways to me they they will see
[58:57] somay and they're like oh yeah Bitcoin
[58:59] Robin was the guy for that let's call
[59:01] him yeah it's exactly and it's because
[59:04] they are building it's it goes back to
[59:06] that P constructivist theory of learning
[59:10] is that they are looking at their house
[59:11] of knowledge Brick by Brick and they're
[59:13] saying oh there's a loose brick here
[59:15] there's a missing brick and so then they
[59:17] come to ask you and this is the perfect
[59:19] moment where you you you you explain to
[59:22] them that brick and that's where they're
[59:23] most receptive because they came to you
[59:25] with a question
[59:26] and then they you fix that one brick for
[59:28] them they put it back and now their
[59:30] house is a little bit stronger and they
[59:31] will um ask you so as long as so I guess
[59:34] the key is just make yourself available
[59:37] and open to questions and honestly
[59:39] that's the best you can do that's
[59:41] absolutely true like um I would say like
[59:44] for and then I tell told them this
[59:47] everyone like if you want to orange pill
[59:49] your family make sure everyone knows
[59:51] that you are a bitcoiner and then just
[59:54] wait
[59:56] they will have questions and they care
[59:59] about you your family loves you even
[60:01] though sometimes it doesn't uh maybe it
[60:03] doesn't seem like that but all all the
[60:05] people love you and you love your family
[60:07] so that's that's something I have a
[60:10] that's one big lesson that I have from
[60:12] Orange Building people one thing uh
[60:14] before we come to the end routine uh
[60:16] that I have uh one question before the
[60:18] end routine I have for you what is the
[60:21] most important lesson that you got from
[60:24] Bitcoin the most important l I got
[60:26] honestly Robin from Bitcoin is Bitcoin
[60:29] is like a like a like a lens like like a
[60:33] binoculars like a like glasses and it or
[60:36] a filter and Bitcoin as a lens it allows
[60:40] you it's almost like a like a like a
[60:42] psychological superpower or a
[60:44] psychological tool that allows you to
[60:48] really um look at everything with like
[60:53] more basic first princip
[60:56] it allows you to look back at your own
[60:58] life and like why did I buy a house when
[61:01] I when I first got my first job why why
[61:04] did I want to buy the biggest house
[61:06] possible and take the biggest mortgage
[61:07] possible why why did why were we told
[61:09] that you know in the in the 2000's era
[61:12] where interest rate was so low why did
[61:14] my why did my parents do what they did
[61:17] why did they migrate from one place to
[61:18] the other why did why did my ancestry do
[61:22] something so Bitcoin allows you to think
[61:25] and be gentle
[61:27] and and realize be kind because they
[61:30] didn't have perfect money I mean and and
[61:33] so they did the best that they could you
[61:36] know whether they saved in real estate
[61:38] or they saved in stocks or they saved so
[61:40] everybody is everybody did the best that
[61:42] they could because money wasn't perfect
[61:45] so Bitcoin allows you to really be nicer
[61:48] gentler and more understanding of what
[61:52] people did what why they did it and how
[61:56] they were trying to get better so that's
[61:58] that's definitely something that Bitcoin
[62:00] has allowed me to do because you know
[62:03] like Fiat centralizes everything Fiat
[62:06] like Banks start becoming bigger and
[62:08] bigger and centralized food companies
[62:10] bigger and bigger oil companies bigger
[62:12] and bigger because it all has to do with
[62:15] who's closer to the money printer so
[62:17] Fiat Farms same thing supermarkets gross
[62:21] like so so so there is a distortion in
[62:24] the market with Fiat so you need you
[62:26] need to look at it from a sound money
[62:29] principle and then it it makes the world
[62:33] even world history makes more sense you
[62:35] know I mean just to to to tell you like
[62:37] for example I love the TV show Vikings I
[62:40] I'm obsessed with I love Vikings uh I
[62:43] also like for example Game of Thrones
[62:45] such fantasy but like Vikings to me was
[62:49] was a lesson in when when the when the
[62:52] in the Golden Age of the Vikings and
[62:54] they go to England and and they raid and
[62:57] then the English king says oh well how
[62:59] many gold coins can I give you to leave
[63:02] and don't come back and you start seeing
[63:04] how how when gold was and how armies
[63:08] they would just like line up and see how
[63:09] much gold every every King has and then
[63:13] they decide to you know what we're not
[63:15] going to just uh fight because maybe
[63:17] it's it's it's losing for both of us um
[63:20] or or or little things there's there's
[63:22] one scene sorry I can I take 30 seconds
[63:25] just to we we have enough time there's
[63:29] one scene in Vikings I don't want to
[63:31] give it away it's a small scene it's not
[63:32] a spoiler but there's there's the
[63:34] there's the brother you know Rolo Rolo
[63:36] is the is the brother of um Ragnar
[63:39] lothbrook he's the main character and
[63:41] Vikings and and Rolo is jealous of his
[63:44] brother Rolo is jealous because he
[63:47] thinks the gods chose Ragnar over him
[63:50] and the people chose Ragnar over him and
[63:52] he's a great warrior he's the bear and
[63:55] Ragnar or you know is more it's a
[63:57] beautiful series it's a beautiful uh
[63:59] it's made by I think by the History
[64:01] Channel Vikings um and it's beautiful
[64:04] and so he goes to the sear you know
[64:06] Robin like the Oracle like the the blind
[64:09] fortune teller and he cries and he says
[64:12] you know like the gods have forsaken me
[64:14] I have no reason to live even even ltha
[64:17] she's the wife of Ragnar he he kind of
[64:19] is jealous because he also loves her and
[64:22] he says like my life is not worth living
[64:24] what am I I'm struggling but he has a
[64:26] good heart he's a he's a strong Warrior
[64:28] he's loyal to his brother he's
[64:30] everything and then the and then the
[64:32] Seer tells him um he starts the sear
[64:35] starts laughing and says if you knew
[64:38] what the gods have in store for you you
[64:41] will go dancing naked on the beach right
[64:44] now and because because what happens
[64:45] it's based on true historic events is
[64:47] Rolo actually has a better ending he
[64:49] becomes the king of Normandy like the
[64:51] king of France gives him a noble woman
[64:54] to marry he becomes the Viking king of
[64:56] Normandy but little things like that
[64:58] like when you understand Bitcoin
[65:00] honestly you start enjoying
[65:03] historical uh dramas and historical
[65:06] works of uh history and even fiction
[65:09] because because you start seeing um our
[65:12] our human the story of us the human the
[65:16] the this human story Through the Ages
[65:18] and it's a really beautiful um thing
[65:21] where Fiat is just foggy Fiat is foggy
[65:24] and Bitcoin is
[65:26] Clarity and it's and I cannot emphasize
[65:28] that uh enough and and I not to go on a
[65:31] tangent but even Banks even Banks you
[65:34] know I'm I'm not here I'm not far from
[65:35] New York New York City like even the the
[65:38] commercial Banks Robin they are now like
[65:42] like we think of it as Bitcoin on one
[65:44] side and Central Bank on the other side
[65:46] or Bitcoin sound money versus Fiat but
[65:49] but Robin the commercials Banks the
[65:51] commercial Banks they will one day
[65:54] realize that they have been with Fiat
[65:57] because they have a lending license so
[65:59] they can just get money for free from
[66:00] the central bank and they can lend and
[66:03] make money based on loans that they make
[66:05] they make a cash flow based on that but
[66:07] now they are going to realize that for
[66:10] them to exist Fiat is going to betray
[66:12] them the I mean the the central bank is
[66:14] going to betray them if they do cbdc
[66:16] Central Bank digital currency well why
[66:19] do you need a central why do you need a
[66:20] a commercial bank then the central bank
[66:24] one node can just put money in people's
[66:26] phones and so even commercial banks are
[66:29] realizing that oh no maybe we need to be
[66:32] on the side of Bitcoin maybe we need to
[66:35] try to custody Bitcoin try to sell
[66:37] Bitcoin try to give financial services
[66:39] and so it's going to change everything I
[66:41] just go back the the whole theme of what
[66:42] I'm saying is Fiat is fog and it will
[66:47] change and it's foggy and it's confusing
[66:50] but Bitcoin has more clarity and it will
[66:52] change alliances Even in our lifetime of
[66:55] things we didn't we cannot even imagine
[66:57] that's a beautiful beautiful uh
[66:59] explanation really cool thank you so
[67:01] much Joe for for that I think that's a a
[67:04] wonderful way to say it and and even
[67:06] like I love the cbdc so much because I
[67:09] think cbdcs will be the best marketing
[67:11] tool for Bitcoin everyone will be like
[67:14] oh that's that's really bad that they
[67:16] can uh uh ban that and do that and uh do
[67:20] all those things with with with feat
[67:22] because it's just like feat but worse
[67:25] than that
[67:26] and people will realiz people are not
[67:27] stupid they will realize that so I
[67:30] really hope and and think that cbdcs
[67:33] will be a great marketing Tool uh for
[67:35] for Bitcoin the the revolutioner really
[67:38] cool yeah and it it will make Banks the
[67:40] commercial Banks who we thought were on
[67:42] the side of Fiat it will make them come
[67:43] to the side of Bitcoin which is blows my
[67:46] mind when I think about that yeah it's I
[67:49] have next uh week even a interview with
[67:53] with someone that uh from a banked he
[67:56] works in a bank and he's now orange ping
[67:58] German Banks Banks uh because there he's
[68:02] saying like all cbdcs basically delete
[68:05] the commercial Banks and he's like if
[68:07] commercial Banks now go on to a Bitcoin
[68:10] standard they might have a chance to
[68:12] actually live on a little bit longer or
[68:14] to actually make business model around
[68:16] Bitcoin because they might not be needed
[68:18] in like five 10 years when cbdcs are
[68:21] around so uh it would be an interesting
[68:23] conversation with him because I think
[68:24] you're very true with cbdcs why why
[68:27] would if if if I have a direct bank
[68:30] account with the uh Central Bank in
[68:33] Europe why do I need my local bank like
[68:37] there's no need for that I can get a
[68:39] loan from the the the ECP directly so uh
[68:43] even though I really hate that thought
[68:45] but it's it's then it's it's possible
[68:47] and it's really interesting yeah so so
[68:50] much uh thank you um we come out an end
[68:52] routine where we have uh one question is
[68:55] is always the same for everyone what can
[68:57] we learn from you besides all the things
[68:59] that we already talked about wow uh just
[69:02] Bitcoin it's good to be humble Bitcoin
[69:05] it's good to be humble and Bitcoin
[69:07] definitely will make you humble look I
[69:09] mean I'm I'm learning so much from
[69:11] people that are half my age and I am so
[69:14] happy and grateful to be to be uh
[69:18] learning from like you and the your
[69:20] podcast I really respect your work ethic
[69:23] and how many you interview I I really
[69:25] Tru I mean I know I I don't think I'm
[69:27] even the first person to say this but I
[69:29] really think that you um will one day
[69:33] become something what like how we think
[69:36] of Joe Rogan or I don't know who else is
[69:38] bigger Tucker Carlson or Lex Freedman or
[69:41] like all these podcasters because I
[69:43] really think
[69:44] that like you will be rewarded for your
[69:47] hard work so so what you can learn from
[69:49] me is number one humility and be humble
[69:53] be open and always always stay on top of
[69:57] puzzles and tricks and like math puzzles
[70:01] and U recreational what we call
[70:04] recreational math you know like like uh
[70:07] you're never just because oh I'm done
[70:09] with school I don't want to do math no
[70:11] read for fun do puzzles for fun you know
[70:14] I teach all my students how to solve
[70:16] Rubik's cubes and puzzles and and and
[70:19] it's really important to keep your mind
[70:21] active and enjoy everything like a
[70:23] puzzle you know like nno Rubik's the
[70:25] founder the creator of Rubik 2 he says
[70:27] all our life is solving puzzles and
[70:30] really it is all our life treat
[70:32] everything like a puzzle um and and
[70:35] that's very very useful it doesn't
[70:37] matter age is just a number you will
[70:40] learn so much from younger people if you
[70:43] humble yourself and the first one of the
[70:46] first things about Bitcoin is you get to
[70:47] bitcoin when you realize that you were
[70:49] wrong about Bitcoin and you're humble
[70:50] enough and you have overcome your ego
[70:53] and many good things will happen to you
[70:54] when you are humble thank you so much
[70:57] that means a lot for me the the
[70:59] compliment Joe Rogan is uh I think the
[71:02] the Grand Master of of
[71:04] podcasting 15 years he's already doing
[71:07] it three or four podcasts on average
[71:10] like 3.4 something like that there's
[71:12] like thousands of of podcast guests with
[71:14] like he does like longer podcast than me
[71:16] so like he has calculate 15 years times
[71:21] 3.4 podcasts a week times 345 hours with
[71:26] each guest that's a lot of knowledge in
[71:27] his head just from the podcast having
[71:30] them um that that's massive so um I'm
[71:34] I'm working to get to that level and
[71:37] that's why I Comm committed to a daily
[71:39] Bitcoin podcast for the next 10 years
[71:42] there might
[71:44] be maybe the topic changes like maybe
[71:47] Bitcoin comes along the way boring
[71:50] because it's already the world Reserve
[71:52] currency along the way I don't think so
[71:54] but maybe the adoption goes faster than
[71:58] that but the next 10 years I will be
[72:00] podcasting no matter what I will be
[72:02] making a podcast every single day uh and
[72:05] I will make that that happen and I
[72:07] committed myself to do that and um I it
[72:11] feels so great to to know what you will
[72:13] do like that's the number one thing that
[72:16] I will do and from there then you can
[72:18] distill all the other things and think
[72:21] your way and and find your way to the
[72:23] different things of like oh you have a
[72:25] guest speaking engagement here or you
[72:27] meet that person maybe you have a small
[72:29] business there so like there are things
[72:32] that have maybe around the podcast but
[72:34] the podcast is the one big thing that I
[72:37] want to continue h so like everyone that
[72:39] is listening and watching this year they
[72:41] can rely on me making this podcast for
[72:43] the next 10 years uh if if I'm
[72:46] physically and mentally uh capable of
[72:49] doing that and I will make sure I am the
[72:51] next 10 years capable to do that so I'm
[72:54] really looking forward to the next 10
[72:55] years and it means a lot that that you
[72:58] see that that my commitment is so high
[73:00] and that you see that the proof of work
[73:02] that goes into that small baby of mine
[73:05] that I have no it it does really Robin
[73:07] it adds value because you know a lot of
[73:09] people are listening and and and and
[73:11] benefiting because you learn I know we
[73:14] sometimes it sounds repetitive what we
[73:15] are saying but it really is it's
[73:17] important I don't think we we think we
[73:20] are um we think everyone knows Bitcoin
[73:24] when you when we are talking only to
[73:25] each other but honestly Robin we are so
[73:27] early people outside have no idea what
[73:31] Bitcoin is it's so interesting like it's
[73:34] it's so so interesting you know that my
[73:36] two friends my my U recently I join I I
[73:40] I um I orange pilled and I was so I was
[73:44] even when I thought they got it I mean
[73:45] they were still asking questions that
[73:47] for sure this is you know like we are
[73:50] early we are early and and
[73:53] um and it's really important to just
[73:56] have a good life and have a try to live
[73:58] a simple life where you are making more
[74:00] money than you are spending so at the
[74:02] end of the day it doesn't matter you're
[74:04] accumulating more um SS and and and just
[74:08] live and time will is on our side it's
[74:12] almost like a game theory in a game of
[74:14] chess or where you almost like you see
[74:16] the advantage but you still have to play
[74:19] a few moves and and eventually you know
[74:22] that the Checkmate is coming uh and
[74:25] you're going to Checkmate your opponent
[74:26] so it's it we are in a situation like
[74:29] this you know we just have to not fumble
[74:31] we just have to not screw up we have to
[74:34] make sure that you know Safety and
[74:36] Security of our setup of our Bitcoin and
[74:39] always make a new goal for yourself like
[74:41] for 2024 you know not just a stacking
[74:43] goal but I I want to run a node I want
[74:45] to start maybe mining next year I want
[74:47] to learn more about that uh something
[74:50] like a small desktop minor and I'm
[74:52] looking already into it but always make
[74:54] a goal like that that will make you more
[74:56] secure and make make sure that I have
[74:59] somebody who I can trust who will pass
[75:02] this along to my daughter because she's
[75:04] my whole life and and my wife and I I
[75:07] mean it's really important it's it's
[75:09] always build your own Citadel build your
[75:13] own um Sovereign existence and make sure
[75:17] that you have a plan to pass it along
[75:19] because I my goal is not to spend the
[75:21] Bitcoin and go crazy when I'm old I mean
[75:23] no my goal is to pass it along to my
[75:25] daughter I I hope I die with more
[75:29] Bitcoin than I have today so that I can
[75:31] pass it along safely that's very
[75:33] important to
[75:35] me I I love that a lot really cool thank
[75:37] you for for those kind words and thank
[75:39] you for those uh I think it's it can be
[75:42] inspiring for for some people that are
[75:43] listening and watching thank you so much
[75:45] um we have the end routine where the
[75:47] previous guest is asking a question for
[75:48] the next guest without knowing who the
[75:49] next guest actually is um your question
[75:52] from the previous guest is opening up a
[75:53] whole new topic do you think
[75:55] homeschooling will be the future of kids
[75:58] education wow that is that's a very very
[76:02] very uh close to heart this question I
[76:06] I'm I'm going to tell you the short
[76:08] answer is yes I think the short answer
[76:12] is yes when you look at old historical
[76:15] dramas and you know like you would have
[76:18] the King's son or the Queen's son and
[76:20] they would have a
[76:22] tutor and it would be a tutor for
[76:24] fencing and a tutor for reading and a
[76:26] tutor for philosophy um I think I think
[76:30] that was very valuable I think also I
[76:36] have a theory that the ideal classroom
[76:38] size and I know I I don't have any proof
[76:42] for it or like scientific evidence or
[76:44] studies but I believe that the ideal
[76:46] classroom size is
[76:48] 12 and it even has to do maybe where
[76:51] Jesus had 12 disciples maybe it has to
[76:54] do mathem atically that uh 12 is a
[76:57] highly composite number you can split
[76:59] the class you can split the students
[77:01] into groups of two groups of three
[77:05] groups of four groups of six 12 is a
[77:08] very composite number you know it's not
[77:10] a prime number it's highly composite so
[77:12] 12 is an ideal number a lot of
[77:15] classrooms right now you know you have
[77:17] much larger um class size I think
[77:21] homeschooling is beautiful I think home
[77:24] schooling is wonderful and and honestly
[77:28] a lot of I I one of my favorite books
[77:32] you know is U Jimmy song Fiat ruins
[77:34] everything and there's a whole I mean he
[77:36] talks about education and it really is
[77:39] honestly Robin education was better
[77:42] before the government got involved in
[77:46] only even in the US before we had the
[77:48] national federal department of education
[77:51] student standardized test scores were
[77:54] better Fiat I'm not going to say ruined
[77:56] education but Fiat has not been good to
[78:00] education and public schools or I should
[78:03] say I should call them government
[78:05] schools and I really really think that
[78:08] we're going to have a golden age ahead
[78:10] of us of tutoring of math education of
[78:15] philosophy of classical
[78:18] education and homeschooling is going to
[78:21] be uh a very very very valuable thing
[78:25] because because even having two parents
[78:28] have to work and go on the rat race and
[78:30] barely survive that is a Fiat concept
[78:34] and on bitcoin it will be a little bit
[78:37] more like the old days when you hear
[78:39] stories of you know my grandfather had
[78:42] one salary he was a janitor and he was
[78:44] able to put four kids in college and buy
[78:46] a house with a fence and Mom stayed home
[78:48] and and and and money was more sound
[78:51] before the the the the money print so so
[78:56] yes to the answer the question yes
[78:58] there's nothing more valuable I mean I
[79:00] have one daughter the the the love of my
[79:02] life I have one daughter she's my whole
[79:04] life and I I was very privileged to
[79:06] spend so much time with her um I mean
[79:09] she did go to school but I was also very
[79:11] involved with her so it's almost like
[79:13] she like for my daughter it's almost
[79:15] like she went to school and got
[79:16] homeschooled by me so it was it was very
[79:19] very um special and and Bitcoin will
[79:22] enable this and not only that I mean
[79:24] that's just one thing education but take
[79:27] that to healthare take that to travel
[79:30] take that to housing a lot of these
[79:33] things a lot of these categories that
[79:35] are now they seem so hard for so many
[79:37] people to make Headway we will have a
[79:40] golden age with with Bitcoin and um dayc
[79:45] carees u i mean everything will be re re
[79:49] re rethought remodeled re re
[79:52] re-envisioned in a Bitcoin on a Bitcoin
[79:55] standard it's it's a what a beautiful
[79:57] question like really it's I'm getting
[79:59] emotional just even thinking about it
[80:01] how how nice it is to be homeschooling
[80:05] so lovely really really cool thank you
[80:07] so much Joe um before I let you go where
[80:09] can people find you ask questions reach
[80:11] out to you yeah no it's um I'm I'm on X
[80:15] it's just Joe casmy um at Joe kazmi I my
[80:20] website is drk maath 777.com
[80:24] so just Dr drk math 777 it's really it's
[80:29] really um um I I mean I I talk about
[80:32] Bitcoin I'm public about it I think it's
[80:35] important for us to be public uh as long
[80:39] as we feel that we are secure in our in

[81:40] seven seven okay so Robin I'm going to
[81:43] put seven in the calculator okay Robin
[81:46] again 30 seconds I'm going to multiply
[81:47] it times nine and Robin what should we
[81:50] expect to have you know 63 yes okay the
[81:53] iPhone works okay now Robin watch I'm
[81:55] going to multiply this this is the
[81:57] product I'm going to multiply it by 1 2
[82:01] 3 4 five six 7even skip eight I'm
[82:05] skipping eight and then multiplying time
[82:07] nine okay I skipped eight Robin what was
[82:10] your original number seven okay now
[82:13] Robin this is a very simple very simple
[82:15] math trick it's not even a trick it's
[82:17] really multiplying three numbers I just
[82:19] changed the order but it just shows you
[82:21] how beautiful math is and when you when
[82:23] you are working with when math education
[82:26] is fun philosophy is fun and and goes
[82:29] back to what you were saying about you
[82:30] know homeschooling and working with a

[83:03] you know it's Elementary School math but
[83:04] it's it's a very beautiful trick and it
[83:07] works with every number and you always
[83:08] skip eight and there's a reason and when
