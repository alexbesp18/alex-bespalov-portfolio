[00:00] I think each time we have a having
[00:01] cycle, you have more people that will
[00:03] come into Bitcoin and they'll come in
[00:04] for basically number go up technology
[00:07] because they'll see it as something
[00:08] like, wow, hey, maybe you can like make
[00:10] money on this. I think I think that's
[00:12] the original hook that gets most people,
[00:14] but you have some amount that actually
[00:15] have dug their hooks in deep enough and
[00:17] they're actually starting to educate
[00:19] themselves and then you kind of have
[00:20] this core that that builds up of actual
[00:23] people that kind of understand Bitcoin.
[00:25] Bitcoiners are kind of dealing with the
[00:27] fact that, hey, we have to recalibrate
[00:28] to a world where we're actually
[00:30] responsible for, you know, ourselves,
[00:32] our security, our family, and these type
[00:34] of things, which I think is actually a
[00:35] lot better than kind of handing off your
[00:38] agency and your sovereignty to third
[00:40] parties and trusting them to do the best
[00:42] job for you. The 2032 having is when I
[00:44] think we go under one bitcoin per block
[00:48] for the first time. So, the block reward
[00:49] drops under one BTC per block because of
[00:52] just the, you know, how we go in half
[00:53] every time. Realistically, you only have
[00:54] 1% of the Bitcoin supply left to mine
[00:57] from 2032 to like basically 108 years.
[01:00] So, um, from that point out, if you
[01:03] haven't already got in, then I think
[01:05] you're pretty much late.
[01:08] [Music]
[01:11] I wanted to start with something
[01:12] different, but because we just talked
[01:14] about that.
[01:15] Um, how do you balance as an artist to
[01:19] be anonymous uh, and and being
[01:22] recognized for the art? Like, how how do
[01:24] you uh do that? And and do you see the
[01:28] sometimes the challenges of like not
[01:29] having a face to promote something in
[01:31] like uh in in the art or do you maybe
[01:34] even see it's
[01:36] there add on to the privacy other
[01:39] advantages?
[01:41] I guess like everything in life it has
[01:43] its tradeoffs. You know there's there's
[01:45] both uh a lot of positives and a lot of
[01:47] negatives. Although I will say when I've
[01:49] gone to a lot of Bitcoin conferences and
[01:51] I meet Bitcoiners that are very public,
[01:53] a lot of them have told me, "Oh man, I
[01:55] wish I had kind of done more like you
[01:57] where I just kept myself more private
[01:59] and uh didn't expose my face or
[02:02] whatever." So I think there is some
[02:04] sense within the community that it's
[02:06] it's that there's just a level of
[02:08] safety. I think security is always the
[02:10] spectrum. You can't ever have perfect
[02:12] security. You could just do the best you
[02:13] can. And um as we were talking about
[02:16] just the last month, the past, you know,
[02:18] in January of 2025, there's just been so
[02:20] many physical attacks against either
[02:22] people holding Bitcoin or some kind of
[02:23] shitcoins. And you know, it's actually
[02:26] relatively scary to see um that level of
[02:29] of attention. And a lot of these people,
[02:31] yes, they did expose themselves. I think
[02:33] there was some like recently, the most
[02:34] recent one was like some porn star that
[02:36] showed a video of hers her Bitcoin
[02:38] wallet that had $20 million. So it's
[02:40] like that seems like a relatively easy
[02:42] target. You know, if you ever see like a
[02:44] heist movie, this one just doesn't seem
[02:45] like terribly complicated, you know. So,
[02:48] but these guys even messed it up. Even
[02:50] these guys, like they end up getting
[02:52] shot by the porn star. So, you know,
[02:54] kudos to her for, you know, securing her
[02:56] herself that way. But it just goes to
[02:59] show that there's certain levels of
[03:01] things that you need to just have do
[03:04] care with online and and um we just live
[03:07] in a world where we haven't been
[03:08] conditioned for that. most people go
[03:10] ahead and they share everything that
[03:11] they have on the world and um it's just
[03:13] the way that we're trained to do
[03:15] nowadays. I just think that's very
[03:16] dangerous and I I always try to tell
[03:18] family members when they're posting
[03:19] pictures of kids and stuff like, "Hey,
[03:20] you shouldn't do that because the kid's
[03:22] not old enough to basically give consent
[03:24] to give their digital identity away and
[03:26] you're their parent, you should be
[03:27] protecting that. You should like like
[03:29] let them make that decision when they're
[03:30] older." Because if you feed a child's
[03:32] photos into the machine every day since
[03:34] they're a baby until they're 18, it's
[03:37] going to have a very good idea of what
[03:38] they look like at every age. You know,
[03:40] the AI will be able to just figure out
[03:41] what you look like at 65 with a beard or
[03:43] with no beard or with blue, you know,
[03:44] like whatever disguise you're wearing,
[03:46] it's going to be able to imagine that.
[03:47] So, it's going to become So, I just
[03:50] think like that's like, you know, one of
[03:52] those digital stewardships that people
[03:53] are just not aware of. And I think as an
[03:56] artist, I I think it's much better for
[03:58] me because I think there's no benefit
[04:00] for people knowing what I look like. I'd
[04:03] rather have the art speak for itself.
[04:05] Like if there's any merit to it. There's
[04:07] a lot of artists that will take pictures
[04:08] of their art and you know, I see a lot
[04:10] of like female painters or different
[04:11] artists that'll take pictures of
[04:12] themselves with the art and yes, they're
[04:14] super cute. Okay, I get it. But like the
[04:16] art should kind of stand for itself, I
[04:17] feel. So, I think like and and I'm not
[04:20] super cute, so I can only be a ne
[04:22] negative to myself. So, if I show myself
[04:26] uh with my art, I'm not gonna have the
[04:27] same reactions that these people are
[04:29] having. So, I figure it's it's only to
[04:32] my benefit to to stay hidden. Um just uh
[04:35] so people don't know how ugly I am. But
[04:39] I I think all around it does make things
[04:41] easier. For example, if I'm walking
[04:42] around a conference, a big Bitcoin
[04:44] conference with uh some of my friends
[04:46] that are much better well-known people
[04:48] in the in the community, uh I could just
[04:51] walk through the conference and nobody
[04:52] even notice me or say anything to me.
[04:54] Whereas these guys can't walk 5t without
[04:56] somebody saying, "Oh, hey man, I love
[04:57] your book. I changed my life." You know,
[04:58] like some people are super recognizable.
[05:00] And I I guess if you thrive on that type
[05:03] of thing, then that's cool. But I don't.
[05:06] And I I actually enjoy the opposite side
[05:08] of it. I like to be like, "Okay, I'm in
[05:10] this big crowd of people and and that
[05:12] actually works to my favor. No one knows
[05:13] who I am." And um you know, so I think
[05:16] that that's been very very helpful to
[05:18] me. I I I think like I just do my best
[05:21] with it. Uh it's not perfect. And I'm
[05:24] sure I make all kinds of mistakes, but
[05:26] you just do the best you can. I mean, I
[05:28] even got a death threat uh what right
[05:30] when we had uh I don't know if you saw
[05:32] it, but like a few weeks ago when all
[05:35] the uh strategic Bitcoin reserve stuff
[05:37] was going on. I I said some anti-XRP
[05:40] thing. I don't know what it was. And
[05:42] then some guy sent me like a death
[05:43] thread over Twitter DM. And I was like,
[05:46] man, I guess this is He actually said
[05:48] something about, "Oh, imagine you're
[05:50] being Bitcoin only. That's so stupid." I
[05:53] was like, "Man, is this the first death
[05:54] threat for being Bitcoin only?" But you
[05:56] know, like like that is so crazy and so
[05:58] stupid. Like I just made an off-hand
[06:00] comment and people threaten you. So,
[06:01] it's like that had nothing to do really
[06:03] with uh Bitcoin specifically or me
[06:06] making like a like an OBSC mistake. It
[06:08] just was like some random comment. But
[06:10] like, you know, just by my having this a
[06:14] little bit layer of anonymity to help or
[06:16] suit anonymity to help is is nice, but
[06:19] certainly like yeah, if anybody's well
[06:21] motivated to kill me, I guess they
[06:23] probably be able to do it. So, it's it's
[06:25] certainly worrisome. I guess, you know,
[06:27] we just live in a wild world with a lot
[06:28] of uh with both a lot of threats and a
[06:31] lot of opportunities. So, it's hard to
[06:33] balance everything between. So, like I
[06:35] said, it's trade-offs. There's there's
[06:37] certainly a lot of benefits to showing
[06:38] your pace and coming out public, but uh
[06:41] I think there's a lot of benefits to to
[06:44] also reserving some of that to
[06:46] selectively reveal it when you choose to
[06:48] to who you choose to.
[06:51] Yeah. kind of it's kind of a one-way
[06:53] street like once you go public um it's
[06:56] like almost impossible to go back. You
[06:58] you can try but um especially if you
[07:02] reach a certain level of publicity. Um
[07:06] you you will never succeed with getting
[07:09] everything off the internet again. Like
[07:11] even if you delete your own stuff,
[07:13] there's stuff that people repost or like
[07:15] take the picture or or have it on
[07:17] another podcast or like there's just
[07:20] there's just like you're 100% right.
[07:24] Yeah. And the more exposure, the harder
[07:26] it is, you know, like the Michael
[07:27] Sailors of the world, they're just
[07:29] never, you know, like AI can just tell
[07:30] you exactly what he looks like cuz
[07:32] there's so much uh images of him online
[07:35] that, you know, he he's never going to
[07:37] take that back. He's not the type of
[07:38] person that cares. He obviously likes
[07:40] likes getting that that kind of
[07:41] recognition. Uh but you know, I think
[07:44] like it's yeah, it's certainly a tricky
[07:48] situation. You know, we had the whole
[07:49] thing with Hodddlnot where he was in the
[07:51] uh the Craig Wright trial and they
[07:53] basically doxed him the whole time and
[07:55] you know, showed his picture and stuff,
[07:56] but I think a lot of Bitcoiners were
[07:58] cool about it and they didn't repost
[07:59] pictures and they kind of kept that that
[08:01] respectful and whatnot. But you can't
[08:03] always depend on people to to be cool
[08:05] and you know realistically like once it
[08:07] happens there's no no putting the the
[08:09] genie back in the bottle. So it's it's
[08:11] really too you know too bad for what it
[08:14] is. And unfortunately like there's no
[08:16] human that's perfect. It's like that's
[08:17] one of the things that's so cool about
[08:18] Satoshi is to see how this person had
[08:21] absolutely perfect operational security
[08:23] that you know all these years later we
[08:26] still have no idea who he is which is a
[08:28] beautiful thing. Uh so I think like
[08:30] that's something to aspire to for all of
[08:32] us and uh you know it's just or for
[08:35] those of us who are you know security
[08:37] conscious or overly paranoid in that
[08:39] way. It's for me it's kind of almost
[08:44] over it's something that I think about
[08:46] sometimes actually of like okay like um
[08:49] could have done it differently or should
[08:51] I have done it differently? Um and I
[08:53] always say like ah like it's it's good
[08:56] they are that are they are public people
[08:58] like we we we we need that uh but uh
[09:01] from just from an individual standpoint
[09:04] um uh I I guess there are a lot of uh
[09:08] upsides to do not for other people not
[09:11] to know because I think about securing
[09:15] my own Bitcoin way way more now uh of
[09:18] like having no threats and and then like
[09:20] okay like what if actually someone
[09:22] figures out my address like uh I mean
[09:24] everyone should do that I think uh but
[09:27] especially if you're a public known you
[09:29] have to just be way more careful and and
[09:33] way more thinking about all the small
[09:36] tippets of like okay uh who do you speak
[09:39] to
[09:40] like where are you going what are you
[09:43] doing with within your house uh and and
[09:45] and where do you keep your Bitcoin uh
[09:48] and and how do you like just playing
[09:51] that example of someone breaking into
[09:53] your home and wanting to have your
[09:54] Bitcoin. What are you doing in that
[09:55] situation? You should have a plan for
[09:57] that. Uh I mean that can happen to
[10:00] anyone but if you're publicly known, you
[10:02] could face you you could higher your
[10:05] chances of doing that way more. That's
[10:07] why a guy like Michael Sailor has
[10:09] security because his threat is very very
[10:12] high. Um mine is almost non-existing and
[10:15] next to him. Uh and so so so that's
[10:19] something that I already think about
[10:21] even though I'm a very very very very
[10:24] small fish in in the whole ecosystem.
[10:27] Imagine being just uh two three five 10
[10:30] levels above that. Uh you almost have to
[10:33] have security uh like physical like
[10:36] people
[10:37] uh and and like houses and then like
[10:40] gated communities and and stuff like
[10:41] that. Like I don't want that. But um uh
[10:46] yeah, that that's that's the main
[10:48] downside to to being publicly known, I
[10:51] guess. Man, that you bring up so many
[10:53] good and powerful points in there and
[10:55] and it brings me back to some old
[10:57] Bitcoin historical reference points. So,
[11:00] uh the Bitcoin Citadel uh idea was
[11:03] originally a short story that somebody
[11:04] wrote. I don't know if you ever read the
[11:05] the Citadel short story. It was a very
[11:08] dystopian short story. I really didn't
[11:10] like it because of that cuz it was kind
[11:11] of like kind of like you were saying
[11:13] where basically you have to set up
[11:14] citadels to protect yourself and like it
[11:16] was basically communities of Bitcoiners
[11:18] that would say like hey if you're
[11:19] Bitcoiner you can come here we can kind
[11:21] of protect ourselves from the rest of
[11:22] the world and it was like segregating
[11:24] things off because you know there was
[11:25] the halves and the halves not due to the
[11:27] to the wide separation between
[11:29] Bitcoiners and and fiaters. Uh so that's
[11:32] certainly like one one thing that it
[11:34] brings up but then also from what you
[11:37] were saying just about the basic
[11:39] security of things like a lot of uh
[11:41] Bitcoiners will you know they post
[11:43] pictures of themselves on planes like
[11:44] hey I'm going here so number one that
[11:46] means they're not in their home. Number
[11:48] two that means you know where exactly
[11:50] where they're going and when they're
[11:51] going there. And then number three, this
[11:54] brings me back to this weird Bitcoin uh
[11:56] trivia that's there's this guy, a
[11:59] shitcoiner named Bas uh Base Carbon. He
[12:02] flew I think this was 2017 or 2018 and I
[12:04] kind of watched this whole thing unfold
[12:06] on Twitter. It was wild. I haven't seen
[12:07] anything about and talk about it since
[12:09] then. So it's not like a really
[12:10] well-known event, but this guy basically
[12:13] flew from somewhere I think from Canada
[12:15] into somewhere or from somewhere into
[12:18] Canada and he said, "Hey, I'm gonna be
[12:19] here. if anybody wants to hang out like
[12:21] let me know. And some girl said, "Yeah,
[12:23] cool. Let's hang out." He's like, "Okay,
[12:25] cool." So, and she ends up picking him
[12:27] up at the picking him up at the uh
[12:29] airport and they go around and he's
[12:31] tweeting for through the day. Okay,
[12:33] cool. Hey, we're here. This is me and
[12:34] the girl. We're hanging out, whatever.
[12:36] And then at some point he post, "Oh, she
[12:39] robbed me for like half a million
[12:41] dollars or something like that." And
[12:43] like everybody was like, "Bro, you
[12:44] didn't see this coming?" Like, you know,
[12:46] it was like it's so obvious, you know?
[12:49] So, and then then people are re making
[12:50] memes out of him put him and her
[12:52] together and stuff like that. But it's
[12:54] just like these type of attacks are not
[12:56] new. Uh it's just that it's just that
[12:59] every time it hits the news cycle, you
[13:01] probably like that was 2017, so Bitcoin
[13:03] was certainly in the news in the news
[13:05] cycles then. Um so it's probably the
[13:07] same thing now. And uh you know, time is
[13:09] a flat circle. So you just see these
[13:12] same type of things pop up again and
[13:13] again. But it's just the type of thing
[13:15] that yeah, it's probably best to to
[13:18] limit that type of information that you
[13:20] put online and then also just limit what
[13:23] you expose yourself to cuz not everybody
[13:25] is a friend even though they may, you
[13:26] know, seem friendly.
[13:29] And it has it advantages and
[13:31] disadvantages. For example, I have a a
[13:33] small story. I was going to El Salvador
[13:37] and I actually stopped posting any
[13:39] Instagram stories. So I I focus now
[13:42] solely on posting
[13:44] um podcasts, articles and in in the
[13:47] future books um uh and not posting like
[13:50] hey I'm on the plane hey I'm I'm doing
[13:53] this uh first because I think I think it
[13:55] doesn't add any value. So I think it's
[13:58] in a way
[13:59] senseless and second it's a security
[14:02] thing but the the the first thing is
[14:04] more important for me that it it doesn't
[14:06] add any value. Um, and I actually was in
[14:09] Toronto uh on on the airport and uh two
[14:14] women came came up to me that that
[14:16] watched the podcast. Uh, and then like
[14:18] two more guys came up and and they were
[14:22] guests actually on my podcast. Uh, and
[14:24] it was from from Canada to to El
[14:27] Salvador and was adopting Bitcoin. So
[14:28] they were actually like half the plane
[14:31] was full with Bitcoiners that I
[14:32] discovered later. Uh but it just made me
[14:36] realize um they could also just
[14:39] recognize me and and be kind of a
[14:42] threat. I mean that was something that
[14:44] it was a a great conversations and and I
[14:47] loved it because I had like a twohour
[14:49] overlay and otherwise would have been
[14:51] bored and and they uh the four of us
[14:55] were like talking and and having fun. Um
[14:58] so that was actually something really
[15:00] positive. But at the flip side, um this
[15:03] also gives you exposure to to threats
[15:06] because all of the sudden you're like,
[15:08] "Okay, like he's Bitcoiner. I know him.
[15:11] He is like hundreds and hundreds of
[15:12] episodes of podcasts." Um so it has his
[15:16] advantages and
[15:18] disadvantages. Um and I personally was
[15:22] like, "Okay, I'm doing this now." uh and
[15:26] I will do it and if something happens to
[15:29] me I'm okay with that because I know the
[15:31] risks like I I could have chosen like
[15:35] because when I started the podcast I
[15:36] basically actually had that conversation
[15:38] with myself like do I want to do that
[15:41] like that was one small thing that I
[15:43] thought about um and I was like okay I
[15:46] will live with that risk because I want
[15:48] to drive with the podcast and and with
[15:51] other things that and I also like um
[15:54] that human connection. So like I like
[15:57] that people come up to me in the
[15:58] conference and say like hey I watched
[16:00] the episode and then we have a really
[16:01] great one two hour conversation
[16:03] sometimes and it's really nice. Uh and
[16:05] then later I never see them again so
[16:08] there were no threats directly this was
[16:10] just a great conversation. Um, so long
[16:14] story, but uh the the point I was
[16:16] making, I knew the security risk from
[16:21] before and I chose that because I like
[16:25] that human connection. Um, uh, but if
[16:29] any if if something happens to me, it's
[16:33] okay for me. I I I I knew it. I know
[16:38] this stuff because this is something
[16:40] that not a lot of people think about and
[16:41] it's cool that you actually did do that
[16:44] what in essence is called a risk
[16:45] assessment. So you went ahead you just
[16:47] you reviewed the risk. You said what is
[16:49] the risk to me? And then sometimes when
[16:52] you mitigate a risk you actually you
[16:54] don't do anything about it in this case
[16:55] like hey well I actually understand the
[16:57] risk and I think this is fi fine because
[16:59] of these things. And that is that is the
[17:01] mitigation in essence because at least
[17:03] you've you've assessed the risk. You
[17:05] know what it is and you basically know
[17:08] what the consequences are and kind of
[17:09] are are cool with that. And I think
[17:10] that's exactly how you got to operate
[17:12] with everything. Like everything is a
[17:14] risk assessment. you know, it's like
[17:15] everything has a different level of risk
[17:16] to you. So, it's just a matter of is
[17:18] this something I actually care about or
[17:19] not cuz you can't treat every risk like
[17:21] as a super high priority. So, I think
[17:24] it's really neat to have uh both of us
[17:26] here because it's it's really kind of
[17:28] neat because we both do have a very
[17:30] similar experience in that way because I
[17:32] also thrive on like the human
[17:34] interaction as well. I like I like that
[17:37] um as well, but I just like to only I I
[17:41] like to kind of selectively filter who
[17:43] who I I let in through the window. And
[17:46] the way that I do that is usually um you
[17:48] know, if I'm at a conference sometimes
[17:50] if I meet people, I would just introduce
[17:52] myself just like I kind of have a
[17:54] nickname that I go by and just introduce
[17:56] myself as that. It's not my name. It's
[17:58] not Fractal Encrypt. And so like they
[18:00] don't put two and two together. It's
[18:01] just, hey, this is like some friendly
[18:02] dude and we talk Bitcoin or whatever.
[18:04] And it's just is what it is. And if I
[18:06] think they're cool, okay, maybe
[18:07] sometimes I'll actually reveal like this
[18:09] is, you know, this this is you know who
[18:12] I am. And then sometimes they they'll
[18:13] actually know me and then we'll have a
[18:14] similar conversation where like you're
[18:16] saying like like these these
[18:18] relationships that happen through the
[18:19] work that you've done do open up really
[18:21] cool opportunities and I'm a big
[18:23] believer in uh like being in the right
[18:26] place at the right time. So I think it's
[18:28] important to kind of put yourself in
[18:29] these in these places. But um but I
[18:32] don't think your identity is always
[18:33] important in those things. It's just a
[18:35] matter of you showing up and like being
[18:36] present for the magic to to occur. But
[18:39] uh I I love talking about these type of
[18:41] things just because it's not not
[18:42] something that most people really are
[18:45] aware of. And being your own bank is a
[18:47] totally different thing. It's just not
[18:48] something that people are are used to.
[18:50] They're used to giving up their
[18:51] responsibility to a third party. So
[18:54] Bitcoiners are kind of dealing with the
[18:56] fact that hey we have to recalibrate to
[18:58] a world where we're actually responsible
[19:00] for you know ourselves, our security,
[19:02] our family and these type of things
[19:03] which I think is actually a lot better
[19:06] than kind of handing off your agency and
[19:08] your sovereignty to third parties and
[19:10] trusting them to do the best job for you
[19:12] because realistically like nobody cares
[19:14] about you but you. So yeah, you know,
[19:17] like you're you're family, you know,
[19:19] like basically you'll have a small
[19:20] community that might actually care, but
[19:22] you but outside of that, you're
[19:24] basically on your own. So I think the
[19:26] more that you learn to to handle on your
[19:28] own, the better off that you can be
[19:30] because just so so much nowadays wants
[19:33] to basically harvest your time and
[19:36] attention away from yourself. Does your
[19:38] family and friend circle kind of know
[19:40] that you're a Bitcoiner? I talked to
[19:42] some unknown Bitcoiner and they don't
[19:43] even say to the like sometimes uh their
[19:47] their close environment doesn't even
[19:50] know that they are Bitcoiner. No, my
[19:53] family definitely knows. I you know my
[19:55] mom's known for a long time. My my
[19:56] brother kind of was one of the ones that
[19:58] like originally started kind of getting
[20:00] my my attention peaked with it. So
[20:02] certainly family is well aware of it.
[20:04] friends. Like most of my friends don't
[20:07] like they might know that I'm a
[20:09] Bitcoiner, but they don't know that I
[20:10] like do art and do all this other stuff
[20:11] for for Bitcoin for the most part. And
[20:14] and it's mostly cuz people don't care.
[20:17] There's like a surface level of of
[20:20] acquaintance that most people have and
[20:22] they're they're fine with that. So if
[20:23] like it's just somebody that's like a
[20:24] small talk person that I'm just meeting,
[20:27] okay, cool. Um, I mean, of course, I
[20:29] have some friends for, you know, that
[20:30] are like lifelong friends and, um, you
[20:33] know, to some degree they just they care
[20:36] about me for me. They don't care about
[20:37] me for anything else. So, it's like they
[20:39] they may or may not like the art or that
[20:41] know about the art stuff that I do. Uh,
[20:43] but most most of them are somewhat aware
[20:45] that I'm into Bitcoin cuz I think I went
[20:47] through my phase of trying to like bring
[20:49] people onto the ark at some point early
[20:51] on. At this point, I've given up. It's
[20:53] like people find their own way and it's
[20:56] also dangerous to try to lead them here
[20:57] because it's just like most people don't
[20:59] have the temperament of a Bitcoiner. So,
[21:02] uh you have to be I think like you kind
[21:04] of have to search it out rather than
[21:06] than like try to lead everybody into it.
[21:09] There's an interesting point actually of
[21:10] like um how we are going because I'm I'm
[21:15] a a firm believer that at some point
[21:18] everyone will use Bitcoin but not
[21:20] everyone will be really aware of that
[21:23] they actually using Bitcoin in the
[21:24] similar way of the TCPIP protocol. I
[21:27] mean granted um a lot of people on this
[21:31] earth actually don't have the internet
[21:32] and don't use the TCPIP protocol but
[21:35] when I say like everyone like in a in a
[21:38] like let's say over 50% of the world um
[21:42] so it's always fun to to talk about how
[21:46] we are actually going to scale there uh
[21:49] and and how we actually going to to get
[21:52] that mass adoption happening and then
[21:55] I'm really curious on on on your
[21:56] thoughts from this. I I think that we
[21:59] just will continue to see waves of
[22:01] Bitcoiners come in like we have over the
[22:03] different having cycles. I think each
[22:06] time we have a havinging cycle, you have
[22:07] more people that will come into Bitcoin
[22:09] and um they'll come in for basically
[22:12] number go up technology because they'll
[22:14] see it as something like, wow, hey,
[22:15] maybe you can like make money on this. I
[22:17] think I think that's the original hook
[22:19] that gets most people. Um, and then that
[22:23] that like washes out a huge amount of
[22:25] them as well in the cycle, but you have
[22:27] some amount that actually have dug their
[22:29] h their hooks in deep enough and they're
[22:31] actually started to educate themselves
[22:33] and then you kind of have this core that
[22:35] that builds up of actual people that
[22:37] kind of understand Bitcoin and
[22:40] and the variety of those type of people
[22:44] is is starting to change exponentially.
[22:47] you know, at the beginning it was
[22:48] mostly, you know, cipher punks and tech
[22:50] nerds, but nowadays it's like bakers,
[22:52] lawyers, you know, doctors, Michael say,
[22:55] like everybody's kind of like kind of
[22:56] coming in and they all bring their own
[22:58] perspective and and own like uh unique
[23:01] basically views into Bitcoin, which I
[23:04] think is so cool cuz it's like
[23:05] everybody's like, man, you could see
[23:06] Bitcoin through this lens or that lens
[23:08] or this lens. And it just makes sense.
[23:09] It's like so unifying in so many ways. I
[23:12] think the reality is that
[23:14] Bitcoin I mean it's it's dangerous to
[23:16] say this but like Bitcoin is bigger than
[23:19] religion in some senses like religion
[23:21] was what was always unifying the world
[23:23] in the past and the Renaissance period
[23:24] you know that's what like caused people
[23:25] to build cathedrals and you know build
[23:28] these magnificent things like that and I
[23:30] think all the art like the Renaissance
[23:31] art most of that was religious art or
[23:34] either that or portraits of kings and
[23:36] stuff and um I think Bitcoin is bigger
[23:39] than that because these religious are
[23:41] also while they are unifying for certain
[23:44] people they're also divisive because the
[23:45] people that aren't aren't of the same
[23:47] ideology you know there's they're
[23:49] different in some sense where I think
[23:51] Bitcoin is money and all humans kind of
[23:53] need money to live in order to feed
[23:55] themselves and and that so I think it's
[23:58] going to it's something that will cross
[23:59] all these boundaries so over time like
[24:01] you said everybody's going to be a
[24:02] Bitcoiner that's basically common sense
[24:04] for I think any Bitcoin just that like
[24:07] we will all use Bitcoin one day and like
[24:09] you said probably some people won't even
[24:11] realize that they're using Bitcoin
[24:12] because it it would just be so mundane.
[24:14] You know, like when we were kids, you
[24:16] used a dollar and you didn't think about
[24:17] like what is money or the whole debt
[24:19] system or the whole you any of that, you
[24:21] know, it was just a dollar was a dollar
[24:22] and what it was worth today it was worth
[24:24] 10 years from that. You didn't know any
[24:26] difference about that. You didn't know
[24:27] about like the financial markets where
[24:28] people were trading currencies and
[24:30] things are actually changing value every
[24:31] second. It's like you save five bucks
[24:34] today, you think it's worth five bucks
[24:36] tomorrow, you don't realize that you're
[24:37] buying less stuff with it. Um, and
[24:40] that's another thing that Bitcoin will
[24:42] change conceptually for a lot of
[24:44] people's brains as well. Because if you
[24:46] move to a Bitcoin standard, from a fiat
[24:48] standard, you move from an inflationary
[24:50] an inflationary system to a deflationary
[24:53] system. And what people don't realize is
[24:56] that means that every year when you go
[24:58] to work, you don't get a year annual
[25:00] raise. you you have to kind of like
[25:02] fight to keep your your current salary
[25:04] or most likely you'll get you'll have to
[25:06] like negotiate your annual decrease in
[25:08] salary because the purchasing power of
[25:10] Bitcoin keeps increasing. So you're
[25:12] basically able to purchase more even
[25:14] though you're getting less sats like
[25:16] okay you know you were getting a million
[25:17] sats now you're getting 900 but like
[25:19] last year a house cost a million and a
[25:21] half and now it only costs 1.1 so your
[25:24] purchasing power has increased. So even
[25:27] though you get less sats now you're
[25:28] actually you're richer. So it's like
[25:31] prices go down, salary goes down,
[25:33] everything trends towards zero in terms
[25:35] of Bitcoin. So that's just a conceptual
[25:38] thing that that a lot of people argue
[25:39] with me about because they don't believe
[25:41] that like oh hey if I work every year
[25:42] I'm not going to get a raise. Like it's
[25:44] like yes, you'll get a decrease in your
[25:46] pay and you'll be happy about it because
[25:48] your per you're still your purchasing
[25:50] power increased from what it what it did
[25:51] last year. You actually still make you
[25:54] know you can earn more. you buy more
[25:56] with what you're making today than what
[25:58] you did all of last year because of the
[26:00] appreciation of Bitcoin. And that's just
[26:02] a hard concept for people to to to come
[26:04] to terms with. So I think there's like
[26:06] going to be this that that's one of the
[26:07] reasons why Bitcoin is the adoption is
[26:10] slow kind of like what you're asking
[26:11] about like where where when will it
[26:14] happen type thing. It's that it's the
[26:15] fact that Bitcoin is super confusing and
[26:19] there's a lot of misinformation about
[26:21] it. So, some of it's purposeful
[26:23] misinformation and some of it is just
[26:25] well-meaning, you know, tom foolery. But
[26:28] those two things basically stop a lot of
[26:31] people that start researching or they
[26:32] get in the way of proper research
[26:34] because you're not actually able to get
[26:36] good information. So, um number one,
[26:38] it's confusing. Two, there's
[26:40] misinformation hiding the actual cool
[26:42] stuff about it. So, there's just a huge
[26:44] barrier to entry. I always say people
[26:47] are lucky uh if they get interested in
[26:49] Bitcoin because you can't help what you
[26:52] get interested in if you think about it.
[26:53] Like you just get interested in the
[26:55] stuff you're interested. You don't know
[26:56] why. It's just like certain things kind
[26:57] of tickle your your intellectual fancy.
[27:00] So um the people that do get interested
[27:03] in Bitcoin, I consider that a lucky
[27:05] blessing for for us. I think about that
[27:07] a lot actually. Um
[27:10] because I I think I'm I'm an unusual
[27:13] Bitcoiner and I think um there are those
[27:16] crafts of of people who are uh early of
[27:20] Bitcoin on what kind of mindset and
[27:21] characteristics they have and I'm
[27:24] actually uh on the not on the early
[27:27] majority. I'm uh like I'm I'm not on the
[27:30] early adopters. I'm more on the early
[27:32] majority uh graph. So even from that
[27:36] perspective, I I think it was double
[27:39] luck. So it was just something like I
[27:43] was super lucky to get into Bitcoin that
[27:46] early. I mean 2020 uh uh it's uh kind of
[27:50] early. It's I think next year will
[27:53] always also be early but from from this
[27:56] perspective there are Bitcoin's that are
[27:58] here for more than 10 years. Um so uh I
[28:02] I think it's it's it's uh super lucky if
[28:06] you are here because even if you're very
[28:08] smart, even if you are um extremely uh
[28:13] curious, you might have overlooked it
[28:15] and you might uh um uh obsessed with
[28:19] other things. I mean at that point 2025
[28:21] I I have to say if if you haven't re
[28:25] researched Bitcoin it's a little bit
[28:27] also your your fault like I I understand
[28:31] in like 2015 uh 2013 maybe but now it it
[28:37] reached a level where the US government
[28:41] is adopting that. Uh I I think if you
[28:44] hear that and uh you should at least
[28:47] hear that a little bit somewhere, you
[28:49] should at least ask yourself a question.
[28:51] Okay, they're calling it digital gold.
[28:55] What is this thing? So, uh it is a luck,
[28:58] but it gets less and less luck from now
[29:00] on. If you get what I mean? Oh, that's
[29:03] such a cool uh perspective to think
[29:06] about because I totally agree with that.
[29:08] It's it's definitely luck for those of
[29:09] us that kind of found it prior to 2025
[29:13] where it actually hit the major news
[29:14] cycles and it's you know you have
[29:16] governments the you know president of
[29:18] the largest country in the world
[29:20] basically talking about it. You you're
[29:22] right it does kind of raise the question
[29:24] that most people should look into it at
[29:26] that point. But the fact of the matter
[29:28] is is you're still only going to have a
[29:30] certain percentage of the people that
[29:31] will get that interest, you know, and
[29:33] it's probably that 8020 rule that always
[29:34] plays out everywhere. actually you
[29:36] probably will have 80% of the people
[29:38] would just dismiss it because their life
[29:40] like is is going on. They don't care
[29:41] about politics so much. They don't like
[29:43] they don't look at this. They're
[29:44] actually trying to just they they don't
[29:46] even have money to save in the first
[29:47] place, you know, like they're just
[29:48] trying to get paycheck to paycheck. And
[29:50] then you'll have 20% of the people
[29:51] that'll like actually start researching
[29:53] it because they heard about it. And of
[29:55] that 20%, you'll have another 8020 split
[29:58] where 80% of them will just like look
[30:00] into it. they'll find misinformation or
[30:01]  or somebody telling them the
[30:03] wrong thing and then they'll buy XRP or
[30:04] something and then then they'll they'll
[30:06] like be wrecked and then they'll never
[30:08] come back and they'll say, "Oh, this is
[30:10] all a scam." You know what I'm saying?
[30:11] And then you'll have 20% of the people
[30:13] that'll be like, "Oh there's
[30:14] something cool here." And they'll kind
[30:16] of they'll be the Bitcoiners of of the
[30:19] of that, you know? And like you're going
[30:21] to always have this little anchoring of
[30:22] a crew of of like core people to
[30:24] actually get the ethos and get why we're
[30:26] here and kind of become Bitcoin only for
[30:29] for whatever that's worth, which I
[30:30] actually think that is worth something.
[30:32] I kind of think that's a good filter.
[30:34] And that's one of the things that I'm
[30:35] using at conferences when I'm talking to
[30:36] people. It's like is this person like
[30:38] actually a Bitcoiner? Because there's a
[30:39] lot of like orangewashing. I love that
[30:42] term uh where people will kind of like
[30:44] be coiners, but a it's like I'd
[30:45] like Bitcoin, buy my shitcoin type
[30:47] stuff. So I think like it's certainly an
[30:50] interesting filter to use. Let's take a
[30:52] break for a moment and appreciate the
[30:54] beauty that Coin Vigilante has made with
[30:58] the Bitcoin watches. Those watches are
[31:00] the most amazing, the most elegant way
[31:03] of showing that you are a true
[31:06] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[31:08] dropped a completely new and amazing
[31:11] Genesis edition of their watch
[31:14] collections. You have the date of the
[31:16] first ever mined Bitcoin block in there
[31:19] and of course also the block height and
[31:22] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[31:25] the level of detail they put in in this
[31:28] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[31:30] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[31:33] down in the descriptions. I love those
[31:36] watches so so much. And now if you have
[31:39] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[31:41] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[31:43] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[31:46] to deal with that. The first way is you
[31:48] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[31:50] entry for you to get into the
[31:53] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[31:56] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[31:59] super simple and secure way. And if you
[32:01] check out the link in the description,
[32:03] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[32:06] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[32:09] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[32:13] partner in terms of how to get the most
[32:16] out of your sovereignty. They will
[32:18] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[32:21] that is perfect for your individual
[32:24] situation. They will show you how you
[32:26] can secure your own devices. Securing
[32:29] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[32:31] have to keep all your devices secure.
[32:33] One topic that is overlooked often is
[32:36] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[32:39] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[32:41] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[32:44] place already? And last but not least,
[32:46] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[32:48] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[32:50] plan B for all that. Head over to the
[32:55] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[32:58] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[33:01] be for the first time ever speaking at
[33:04] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[33:06] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[33:09] really looking forward to seeing all of
[33:11] you there. You can get your ticket in
[33:13] the link down in the description of
[33:16] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[33:18] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[33:22] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[33:23] there. Yeah, but you usually can tell
[33:26] very early on. Yeah,
[33:29] I I I usually know after speaking with
[33:33] someone for two minutes if he's a
[33:34] Bitcoin or a shitcoiner. Absolutely.
[33:37] Yeah, you don't need that long. Yeah,
[33:38] you don't need that long at all. Like
[33:40] you you can basically identify it
[33:42] relatively within the first few
[33:43] sentences of the conversation for sure.
[33:45] I get that. Uh but yeah, I I definitely
[33:49] think that the the we're going to see
[33:52] some people that will come on right now
[33:53] and and those people I also still
[33:56] consider lucky and early in some sense
[33:57] cuz like there's going to be people that
[34:00] that keep having this revelation. You
[34:01] know, the next having is going to be
[34:02] 2028 and then the next one's in 2032.
[34:05] And the 2032 having is when I think we
[34:07] go under one Bitcoin per block um for
[34:12] the first time. So the block reward
[34:14] drops under one BTC per block because of
[34:16] just the you know how we go in half
[34:17] every time. It's either 2032 or 2036.
[34:20] I'm pretty sure it's in 2032. So that's
[34:22] like super close to now realistically
[34:24] like 7 years away. Um so when that
[34:26] happens I just feel that the supply like
[34:28] realistically you only have 1% of the
[34:30] Bitcoin supply left to mine from 2032 to
[34:33] like basically 108 years. So, um, from
[34:37] that point out, if you haven't already
[34:38] got in, then I think you're pretty much
[34:40] like you're late, you know, you know.
[34:43] So, but anybody between now and 32, 2032
[34:46] that gets in, I think we're still like,
[34:47] okay. Um, but after that, I think it's
[34:50] going to become more of a situation
[34:52] where you won't be able to buy Bitcoin
[34:54] as easily, but you will be able to work
[34:56] for it and then, you know, your job will
[34:58] just pay you in Bitcoin and stuff like
[35:00] that. kind of how you said it'll just
[35:02] transition into the way that the world
[35:03] works and people won't notice it because
[35:05] it's just that's yeah that's what you
[35:06] earn. It's not like hey I'm trying to
[35:08] save in Bitcoin. It's just yeah you're
[35:10] paid in SAS you spend them and you live
[35:12] and then you
[35:14] whatever. But yeah I think that's how it
[35:16] rolls. Absolutely. Really cool. I'm now
[35:20] already in the situation where uh I get
[35:22] a fiat salaries salary. It's a business
[35:25] so I get fiat income but uh my majority
[35:27] of my income is actually already in
[35:29] Satoshi's uh which is super uh super
[35:33] cool um which also forced me to do one
[35:36] thing uh not forced me but I'm doing it
[35:39] um I look at two metrics I look at okay
[35:43] what is my income in euros because I'm
[35:47] uh in the European Union so I'm in in
[35:49] Austria uh and what is my income in
[35:53] bitcoin what is my income in Satoshi's.
[35:55] Um, and I basically measure not only
[35:58] income but also net worth in both
[36:00] metrics. Uh, and I found it in the
[36:06] income department, it's currently better
[36:08] for me to look at the euros and in the
[36:11] net worth department, it's currently
[36:12] better to look at Satoshi's and Bitcoin.
[36:15] Um, because in income, it's kind of
[36:17] frustrating over long run. if you're
[36:19] like you're making all those those
[36:23] um uh you you you getting better and
[36:25] stuff like that, but because Bitcoin
[36:27] adoption is growing, um you it's kind of
[36:30] hard to keep up with that and and still
[36:32] get the same amount of Bitcoin. uh uh
[36:36] and with the net worth I'm doing in
[36:38] Bitcoin because um it's a way more
[36:41] natural and smoother way
[36:44] uh because you see only the number
[36:46] growing a little bit over time and I
[36:49] like that I uh uh and I like to have the
[36:52] stable number because if you look at it
[36:55] in euros it's super volatile and and
[36:59] sometimes like oh like Bitcoin is
[37:00] shooting up 50% in like half a year it's
[37:03] like oh like I'm I'm I'm so good. And
[37:06] then it shoots down 20%. I'm like, oh,
[37:07] like everything's crashing down and
[37:09] you're feeling so bad. So, uh I I came
[37:11] to realize that denominating more and
[37:14] more into Bitcoin into
[37:17] um is a really good feeling for your
[37:19] inner peace and and and for your uh
[37:23] yeah, for for for that uh for to to keep
[37:27] keep that in in mind. Damn, dude. I know
[37:30] what you're saying. That makes so much
[37:31] sense. It's yeah, it's like the
[37:33] stability of it. It's like one BTC
[37:35] equals one BTC. You know, you look at
[37:36] your balance, it's relatively easy to
[37:38] tell what you got. Whereas like the US
[37:41] dollar thing is just fluctuating or the
[37:42] euro, it's just fluctuating every
[37:44] second. That that is a very interesting
[37:47] way to look at it. Um, and and I also
[37:50] think kind of like you were saying, you
[37:52] were basically describing in some sense
[37:55] the exact conundrum that I was talking
[37:56] about that people in essence you're
[37:59] still doing the same amount of work, but
[38:01] because Bitcoin's price is increasing,
[38:03] the adoption's increasing, you get a
[38:05] smaller amount of Bitcoin for doing the
[38:07] same amount of work in essence. Like,
[38:09] and I think that just happens more and
[38:10] more as time goes on. So, like the
[38:12] longer time goes on, you'll do the same
[38:14] amount of work and you'll just earn less
[38:16] Bitcoin because the price of Bitcoin
[38:17] will be higher. And that's just kind of
[38:18] common sense. That's true whether you're
[38:21] uh you know a Bitcoin miner. You know,
[38:22] if you're a machine actually running the
[38:24] network, it's kind of common sense that
[38:25] over time, you know, you're going to do
[38:27] the same amount of work, but because of
[38:28] the having, you're going to get less
[38:30] Bitcoin. Well, for people, it's the same
[38:33] damn thing, you know. So, you know, that
[38:36] it's like you're living that. And that's
[38:37] so so interesting. I I know not a lot of
[38:39] people will have that dual income where
[38:41] you have like some in Satoshi's and some
[38:42] in US dollars. So, that's a very unique
[38:44] perspective that I know not a lot of
[38:46] people will have. That's really cool
[38:48] because it kind of opens up that zen
[38:50] feeling of saying, "Hey, you know, yes,
[38:53] both both ways it's coming." But if you
[38:55] actually just measure measure it in
[38:57] terms of Bitcoin, it's like it's much
[39:00] more balanced and and it's actually like
[39:02] gives you a sense of peace, which I mean
[39:04] there's value in that that's kind of
[39:05] unspoken.
[39:08] Yeah. And and I'm also happy currently
[39:10] that I still have both because I I still
[39:13] need to pay uh in both. So, one of my
[39:16] post-p production members is is taking
[39:19] salary in in Bitcoin, one of them takes
[39:22] it in fiat. So, I have to do some orange
[39:24] billing on the data side. Uh so, uh you
[39:28] you have bills on on on the Bitcoin
[39:30] side, on the fiat side. And it's great
[39:32] to have both things and uh it's hope I
[39:36] can keep it equal that I don't have to
[39:38] exchange a lot with exchanges in
[39:39] between. But um uh back back to you. I
[39:44] actually wanted to start with one
[39:45] question and we're already 40 minutes in
[39:47] and I haven't asked my first question
[39:50] yet. Um I wanted to ask you the
[39:53] question, why do you focus on on on
[39:56] Bitcoin uh with your art? Because you're
[39:59] doing art and and as an artist, you can
[40:01] basically focus on anything. You can
[40:03] make the same art you're doing uh with
[40:05] with a different theme. uh why do you uh
[40:08] focus on on on Bitcoin?
[40:11] Oh, it's a great question and uh yeah,
[40:14] worth waiting the 40 minutes for. Not a
[40:16] problem. So, I think uh to me the art is
[40:21] kind of an extension of your life and
[40:22] and in some way it's like it's so many
[40:25] things to me. One, it's like a teaching
[40:27] tool. Like I like to use art as a way to
[40:29] tell a story, you know, like and I like
[40:30] the story to be cool and interesting.
[40:32] And a lot of times I get uh interested
[40:35] in, you know, things that are in the in
[40:37] the real world. And so I want to
[40:39] basically explain what I think is cool
[40:41] about that. And I think um the way that
[40:45] I can do that best is through the art.
[40:47] So pretty much my whole life I've done
[40:49] art. Around 2008, I first started
[40:52] selling art. Um maybe a little earlier
[40:54] than that. I think maybe like 200
[40:56] fiveish was the first time I might have
[40:58] done like some really like little
[41:00] trinkets where I set out a blanket at a
[41:01] concert and tried to sell some. Uh it
[41:04] actually went really well. I think I
[41:05] like sold all my little sold all the
[41:06] little art pieces that I made there and
[41:08] that was really rewarding and I kind of
[41:09] built from there. And
[41:12] um in the past I did art that was all
[41:15] psychedelic art cuz I was very much into
[41:17] psychedelics cuz I thought it was like a
[41:19] uh a technology that was misunderstood
[41:21] in essence. Like it was kind of really
[41:23] actually wholesome and and good family
[41:25] value stuff but it was just portrayed by
[41:27] the media and the government in a
[41:28] totally different light and it was
[41:30] actually a tool that people could use to
[41:32] benefit their lives. And I wanted to
[41:33] tell that story, something like, hey,
[41:35] this is a, you know, something that
[41:36] you're not being told. This is actually
[41:38] what's going on. And I did that for many
[41:41] years, pretty much from that 2005 time
[41:43] to um
[41:44] around 2016ish 2017. And then in 2017, I
[41:48] encountered Bitcoin. And that really
[41:51] kind of captured my mind. And it it's
[41:54] the same thing where I see this this
[41:56] really amazing revolutionary technology
[41:59] that can be used to as a tool for self-
[42:01] sovereignty. Uh I I actually see both
[42:03] psychedelics and Bitcoin as
[42:04] complimentary revolutionary
[42:06] technologies. They're both tools that
[42:08] people can use to better their lives,
[42:10] their family, their community, the whole
[42:12] world. You know, these are things that
[42:13] are very powerful, but they're both
[42:15] misrepresented. You know, the government
[42:16] tells you one thing about it. You know,
[42:18] you hear all this stuff, oh, it's used
[42:19] for criminal drug dealers and you know,
[42:22] uh all the worst. Uh whereas actually
[42:24] like that's not the the real story.
[42:27] Although to some degree, I do have the
[42:28] saying that, you know, your drug dealer
[42:30] doesn't want it. it's not real money.
[42:31] Uh, so there's that that side of it,
[42:33] too. But I think there's just there's a
[42:36] lot of depth that gets missed. And art
[42:39] is that sly roundabout way that I can
[42:42] use to kind of get people interested in
[42:45] Bitcoin. Like we were saying, it's kind
[42:46] of lucky when you do get interested in
[42:48] Bitcoin. And art, I think, is an
[42:49] interesting way to to bring people in.
[42:52] You know, some people get brought in by
[42:53] education, by podcast, by books, by
[42:56] movies. Some people get brought in, you
[42:57] know, through art. So, I think that's
[42:59] that's the the contribution that I
[43:03] bring. But but for me, it's super
[43:04] important because I
[43:06] think you basically don't have very long
[43:08] on this planet. We get a very super
[43:10] limited time. And that's one of the
[43:12] things that Bitcoin teaches you. And so
[43:15] what you should be doing with your time
[43:17] is basically the most important thing to
[43:20] you, you know, the most important thing
[43:21] in the world to you. And you know, it's
[43:23] like I'm trying to to find that thing,
[43:26] you know, trying to keep keep building
[43:27] myself towards that. Like, and I think
[43:29] like Bitcoin is is the way to to get
[43:32] there for me. It's certainly an unending
[43:35] well of inspiration to pull upon, you
[43:37] know, like every time I look at Bitcoin,
[43:39] there's something new and cool about it
[43:41] that's like, oh, that's, you know,
[43:42] inspiring in so many ways. And there's
[43:44] just so many ways to translate this into
[43:47] something that might be visually
[43:48] intriguing to other people. So, um I
[43:52] mean I think we have to lean into what
[43:53] we're good in in life. And I think like
[43:56] the art thing comes to me very fluidly.
[43:59] Like I kind of get into a state where it
[44:01] just like there's nothing else going on.
[44:04] There's no time. There's no space. Like
[44:05] my wife will come to me. She's like,
[44:06] "Yo, you haven't eaten all day. What's
[44:09] going on?" But I I won't even feel
[44:11] hungry because I'm just lost in what I'm
[44:12] doing. It's like there's there's this
[44:13] like beautiful harmony of just the
[44:15] creative process that that is that kind
[44:19] of drives me, you know, like I I have
[44:21] this feeling every day where if I'm not
[44:23] doing something or moving towards that
[44:25] goal of kind of bringing something into
[44:26] the world that I'm, you know, I'm
[44:29] messing up. I got to, you know, I got to
[44:31] kind of get on it. So there's there's
[44:33] certainly this desire, this need to
[44:35] create that is is buried deep within me.
[44:40] And I don't I don't dislike that in any
[44:42] way. I actually thrive off that.
[44:46] In in in many ways, art is a as a
[44:50] podcast um like a form of communication,
[44:54] but it's just a different form of of of
[44:57] doing that. I I like that feel of like
[44:59] art as a form of communication. Really
[45:02] really nice. Was it actually hard to to
[45:04] start being an in Bitcoin artists? I I I
[45:08] talked to someone.
[45:10] It's like it's it's harder to to
[45:12] monetize especially in the beginning.
[45:15] Oh yeah, man. Like well art is a luxury
[45:18] item. So those are always a hard sale
[45:22] and in sense you know like art's not a
[45:24] necessity. You don't really need that to
[45:26] to you know provide food, clothing or
[45:28] shelter for your family. Art is
[45:30] something you buy after all those are
[45:31] secured. And so number one it's a luxury
[45:34] item from the from top to bottom. Number
[45:37] two, unless you do functional art, you
[45:40] know, like if you make spoons or knives
[45:41] or something cool that people need to
[45:43] like eat or, you know, like something a
[45:44] cup or a plate, like okay. But if you're
[45:46] doing like wall art like I do, then that
[45:49] that's like a really okay, you know,
[45:51] that's a basically something that nobody
[45:54] actually needs to live. So yes, it's a
[45:56] hard sell. But when you add that on top
[45:59] of the fact that you're like for me, I
[46:00] only sell the art in Bitcoin. I don't
[46:02] actually even though it's Bitcoin art, I
[46:04] don't like accept fiat for it. I'll only
[46:05] sell it in Bitcoin. So that limits the
[46:08] market even further cuz nobody wants to
[46:10] spend their Bitcoin. Uh you know, so
[46:12] it's like extremely hard to sell um
[46:15] Bitcoin art if you want to basically do
[46:18] it like that. I'm sure that if you sell
[46:20] Bitcoin art and you also accept fiat,
[46:22] then it's going to be one level easier.
[46:24] But that doesn't make it I I wouldn't
[46:26] put it in the easy realm. However, I
[46:28] think the the good part about doing it
[46:31] for Bitcoin only is that it makes you
[46:33] raise your game. So, I understand that
[46:35] unless I bring a really top level thing
[46:38] that nobody's going to basically come
[46:40] off their Bitcoin for it. So, I have to
[46:42] basically do something good enough,
[46:44] excellent enough for someone to say,
[46:46] "Man, I really like that enough to part
[46:48] with some Bitcoin." And it's a it's hard
[46:50] to do that. So, like I basically will
[46:52] spend usually it takes months and months
[46:53] to create like a piece. uh because I I
[46:56] know it's like in some sense it's like
[46:58] I'm mining Bitcoin, you know, like I'm
[47:00] basically putting in my work here and
[47:02] I'm taking these art supplies and some
[47:04] imagination, you know, in the end it's
[47:06] like yes, there's all these input costs
[47:07] plus the time, but in the end I'm hoping
[47:10] that I'll mine some Bitcoin and you
[47:12] know, sometimes you do, sometimes you
[47:13] don't. But the cool thing is with art,
[47:15] um I guess if you're doing Bitcoin
[47:16] mining, you don't mine a block, then you
[47:18] just have a electricity bill. But if I
[47:20] make a art piece that I really love and
[47:23] I don't sell it, then actually I still
[47:24] have it and I still love it. I like that
[47:26] way. I talked uh and I don't want to
[47:30] uh I don't know if he wants to share
[47:33] that information publicly, so I I won't
[47:35] say his name. Uh but I sat uh I sat down
[47:39] with someone in Bitcoin who has a shop
[47:41] uh and he was thinking about doing it
[47:44] Bitcoin only versus also having uh fiat
[47:47] and he deducted I think uh two or three
[47:51] weeks experiment and just deleted the
[47:53] fiat option to pay like he had bitcoin
[47:55] and fiat uh and before the experiment he
[47:59] was very nervous because 80% of his
[48:01] revenue was actually in fiat.
[48:04] uh what happened is that 70% of the
[48:07] revenue was just missing. So some were
[48:10] still buying uh so uh in in Bitcoin and
[48:13] so some of the 80% were actually
[48:15] converting to to also then buy it in
[48:17] Bitcoin but overall his his revenue just
[48:20] dropped dramatically because people
[48:23] didn't wanted to spend the Bitcoin even
[48:25] though those those this is a Bitcoin
[48:27] shop. So you only shop there if if you
[48:29] are Bitcoiner. uh and uh it that's super
[48:33] interesting when when you think about
[48:36] them only doing bitcoin there for
[48:38] example also they are doing from the
[48:41] starting uh just bitcoin like you can
[48:43] only buy with bitcoin there uh and and
[48:47] only sell it in bitcoin
[48:49] um this is uh something I really really
[48:54] admire like having that clear ethical
[48:58] thing of like I only accept bitcoin
[49:00] um is really really massive. Um I like
[49:04] also the way um PDC sessions, Ben from
[49:08] PDC session does uh he said it actually
[49:10] on my podcast. He said um if someone
[49:15] insists in uh in in paying in fiat, he
[49:19] charges a 15% premium on that. So uh
[49:23] that's also an interesting way of
[49:24] incentivizing people to pay in Bitcoin.
[49:26] But obviously not even Bitcoiners uh
[49:29] want to spend their Bitcoin. So it's a
[49:32] it's a hard thing to do. So I admire
[49:34] that that you do that. Thanks. Well,
[49:37] that makes sense. And it's actually a
[49:38] really interesting story about that that
[49:40] shop. And I I would expect that that
[49:42] would be true across the board for most
[49:44] places that the revenue you're going to
[49:46] have some people that just won't won't
[49:49] spend their Bitcoin and some people that
[49:51] just, you know, they may be, you know,
[49:52] Bitcoiners, but they don't have have it
[49:54] on exchange or something. they don't
[49:55] have like they don't know how to send it
[49:56] around. They don't feel comfortable with
[49:57] it, so they want to spend their feet out
[49:59] or whatever. Um, so yeah, I think that
[50:02] for shops like that, it's it's really
[50:04] cool cool to see that and I think over
[50:06] time that that will build the right
[50:08] clientele for them if they can can
[50:10] survive in that type of a market. Uh, I
[50:12] I can I definitely can relate and it's
[50:15] it's it is what it is, but I think it's
[50:16] really it's it definitely it makes it
[50:19] easier in a lot of ways, but I think
[50:22] that it's that Gresham's law where
[50:24] people just want to spend the bad money
[50:25] first. So, if they have any fiat, they
[50:27] would prefer to spend that before they
[50:29] spend their Bitcoin. So, it just makes
[50:31] it a difficult situation for those
[50:33] Bitcoin only shops. But I do think that
[50:36] you see the more these that you see
[50:38] succeeding, the more of a hard line in
[50:40] the sand you'll see because I think that
[50:42] they'll be successful over time. Like
[50:44] there's the Tahini's restaurant that
[50:46] actually um they of course they take
[50:49] fiat for their the food services that
[50:51] they provide, but they basically turn
[50:54] that into Bitcoin in some sense. That's
[50:55] like the way that they mine Bitcoin is
[50:57] through schwarma or falafles, you know,
[50:59] like they make their stuff and then they
[51:00] they convert it into Bitcoin. So you
[51:02] have both sides of it. And the thing
[51:04] that Deb Ben said actually makes a lot
[51:05] of sense. Like if you're going to accept
[51:07] both, then you you actually put the
[51:09] premium on the fiat and say, "Hey, like
[51:12] this caused so much friction and so much
[51:14] there's usually extra fees and extra
[51:16] nonsense that you have to deal with to
[51:17] accept fiat as well." So, it's certainly
[51:19] worth at least that 15% premium. And I
[51:23] think over time you'll see like, you
[51:24] know, like we said, like we'll all be
[51:26] Bitcoiners. It'll just be abstracted
[51:27] into the background and that's not going
[51:29] to even be a thing anymore. But I think
[51:30] the more of us that are online with it,
[51:33] um I think that that does create create
[51:36] uh um you know the right optics, I think
[51:39] that it is a it is a good healthy thing
[51:41] for a business to do. It's just tricky
[51:43] to navigate in this world. You just have
[51:45] to really bring your best and understand
[51:46] that it's a tough thing out there for
[51:48] people to try to spend their Bitcoin
[51:50] especially as um people acquire it
[51:53] nowadays. I think like uh maybe earlier
[51:55] it might have been a little easier but
[51:56] nowadays where most people are getting
[51:57] it through exchanges it tends to be a
[52:00] little more friction I think to to
[52:01] onboard. So um we'll see once once that
[52:05] kind of goes away where the it's just
[52:07] more circular economy where people that
[52:10] have Bitcoin are spending it and with
[52:12] vendors that accept it and then those
[52:13] vendors then spend it around. I think
[52:15] that that will start to see a whole new
[52:17] flourishing of the uh the monetary
[52:19] aspects as well of Bitcoin. How
[52:22] important uh is it for Bitcoiners to to
[52:25] start thinking about spending Bitcoin
[52:27] and and trying to power up that that
[52:30] that circle economy? Man, it's a tough
[52:32] question. I think it's super important.
[52:34] I I I actually think it would be great
[52:36] to see more PE or to see a more robust
[52:39] circular economy with Bitcoiners
[52:41] producing on both sides of it.
[52:43] Bitcoiners producing the goods that are
[52:46] being consumed and then Bitcoiners
[52:47] buying the goods that are consumed. So
[52:49] you have this true circular economy cuz
[52:52] now a lot of times like places might
[52:53] accept Bitcoin but it could just be like
[52:56] uh you know overstock.com or something
[52:58] accepts coin for example whereas uh
[53:00] something like you know me it's like
[53:02] actually is a bitcoiner that is
[53:04] producing the art and then you're buying
[53:06] it in bitcoin and it's kind of stays in
[53:09] that economy. I think that that type of
[53:11] thing is super important. So, um I think
[53:14] and I think we're going to see a lot
[53:15] more of that because I think the same
[53:17] thing that I'm doing with art is just it
[53:18] will just be true across the board. You
[53:20] will see it with mechanics, bakers,
[53:21] lawyers, doctors, everybody will do the
[53:23] same thing where oh okay I'm accepting
[53:25] Bitcoin and you know and then those
[53:27] people are just paying in Bitcoin and
[53:29] then I think like that type of thing
[53:30] will will just have a virtuous cycle
[53:34] where it would just create benefits for
[53:36] everybody who's involved and then those
[53:37] on the outside of it will kind of look
[53:39] in and see the see this abundance that's
[53:41] happening and start to it's it's kind of
[53:43] obvious. it. I think that that's when
[53:45] things start to catch on is when you
[53:47] know people see their neighbors
[53:48] benefiting from it like someone needs
[53:50] help.
[53:52] Do it's the hardest question to answer
[53:54] probably, but do you think it's a
[53:56] peaceful revolution?
[54:01] Uh,
[54:02] I don't know. I mean, I I have read some
[54:07] fiction stories about like monetary
[54:09] collapses and whatnot. And if that's the
[54:11] way that it goes, then I don't know if
[54:14] that would be peaceful. But the way the
[54:17] world's going right now is certainly
[54:18] looking much more in that way where
[54:21] we're seeing like actual actual
[54:22] countries talking about adopting
[54:24] Bitcoin. kind of makes you think because
[54:27] uh I think we all go through these these
[54:30] shitcoinery phases in some sense like
[54:32] the nations will go through it just like
[54:34] the like you as an individual might go
[54:36] through it like like you I'm calling it
[54:38] shitcoinery but it's just like a phase
[54:40] where you don't actually understand
[54:41] bitcoin well you know about it you want
[54:42] to get some you may even have some but
[54:44] you don't like fully get like what it is
[54:46] and I think like anybody that's true
[54:48] with all of us like that we don't fully
[54:50] get it but there's a level of not fully
[54:52] getting it that's that you really
[54:54] haven't achieved yet. So, because of
[54:56] that, there's like there's going to be a
[54:58] lot of dissonance and like there'll be a
[54:59] lot of growth and and whatnot. So,
[55:01] you'll see probably some countries will
[55:02] get hacked and all their Bitcoin will
[55:04] get lost and then they'll learn about,
[55:06] oh, damn, we got to secure our stuff a
[55:08] little better and you know, like
[55:10] everybody else will also learn at the
[55:11] same time. The whole the whole world
[55:13] will be like, "Oh, that sucks." You
[55:15] know, we don't want that to happen to
[55:16] us.
[55:17] So, you know, like there'll be a lot of
[55:19] growth, but then at the same time, the
[55:21] thing like we see in Bhutan where
[55:22] they're using their uh their natural
[55:24] resources to mine Bitcoin, but then
[55:26] using the money that they earn from that
[55:28] to pay for the public servants. So, all
[55:30] the politicians, I guess, are paid
[55:31] through the Bitcoin that they mine with
[55:33] the country's resources rather than
[55:35] taxes. Like, that to me is so wholesome.
[55:37] You know, you see stuff like that. It's
[55:38] like a virtuous cycle. So it like you
[55:40] need to install the mining equipment and
[55:42] you know the facilities and then all the
[55:44] staff all that's like basically jobs and
[55:46] jobs for your local community you know
[55:48] and it's like creating this cool
[55:50] abundance and funding the public works
[55:52] without having to like be funded through
[55:54] taxes. It's actually funded through
[55:56] proof of work. So I think you'll see
[55:57] more of this happening as well. So
[55:59] you'll see both both sides of it the
[56:00] good and the bad. And because of that
[56:03] it'll just you know over time I I think
[56:05] over time there's just no other way
[56:07] around it. It is gonna be violent in
[56:10] some places and peaceful in other
[56:11] places. I think just like the world is
[56:13] like you like some places will come
[56:15] online much easier and some places will
[56:18] resist and it'll probably you know it'll
[56:22] probably be a whole different story. I
[56:24] think the thing is like with Bitcoin
[56:25] always it's just the earlier to adopt
[56:29] the better the country or the business
[56:32] or the individual will be. You know,
[56:34] it's kind of like the sooner you you
[56:35] come to terms with, hey, this is
[56:37] actually good for us, we should figure
[56:39] out how to work with it, then the better
[56:41] it is for y'all. You know, if you kind
[56:43] of like find it and want to change it or
[56:44] find it and want to like, you know,
[56:46] extract value from it, then it's kind of
[56:48] like that you get the FFO experience.
[56:52] It's it's it's very much like the the
[56:54] internet. Those countries who adopted it
[56:57] and used it as as early as possible and
[57:01] embraced it rather than regulated it and
[57:04] tried to like ban it and and stuff like
[57:06] that. Um uh have profited for from that
[57:10] more. H and also when you look at the
[57:14] internet there are places where there is
[57:17] no internet. There are places where
[57:18] there's no electricity and there's
[57:20] places where if there's no electricity,
[57:23] people go on the streets and have riots.
[57:25] So, uh so there different places adopt
[57:30] Bitcoin also differently. I think that's
[57:31] a a very good way to to look at that um
[57:36] uh of like okay we we have places
[57:38] without electricity, we have places
[57:40] without internet, we have places without
[57:43] those things. Uh and yeah, we will also
[57:46] have probably uh a long time places
[57:48] without Bitcoin because you kind of need
[57:52] um the the other things also to exist
[57:54] there. Uh you need some some sort of
[57:57] electricity for for Bitcoin to to make
[58:00] global sense uh in that way. I think
[58:04] that's a very based way in uh at looking
[58:07] at that. Yeah, I think that that makes a
[58:09] lot of sense and and certainly if you
[58:12] don't have electricity, it makes it hard
[58:13] to ruin Bitcoin. Certainly not
[58:14] impossible. We can do a lot of cool
[58:16] analog Bitcoin stuff, but uh but yeah,
[58:19] it makes it makes it a lot trickier and
[58:21] and like you said, you know, everybody's
[58:22] going to have different times when they
[58:24] they come online to it. And it just
[58:26] brings me back to that Citadel story and
[58:29] you don't know if like what the future
[58:30] is going to be if like you'll have this
[58:32] situation where they they'll be like the
[58:33] Bitcoin, you know, Bitcoin cast system
[58:37] in some sense where it's like, hey, you
[58:38] know, like the people that were smart
[58:40] enough to or were lucky enough to to get
[58:43] on the ark earlier uh benefited
[58:46] exponentially versus the the places that
[58:48] were longer to come online and those
[58:50] places just they suffer in terms of
[58:52] development and education and health and
[58:55] all the all the things that are
[58:56] important. So, we'll see. We'll see. I
[58:58] don't know. I don't think it will be
[59:00] that dark, but uh it just does make me
[59:03] think of that short story. Absolutely. I
[59:06] I I do hope and I think we have as
[59:08] Bitcoin is kind of a responsibility if
[59:11] if we are kind and loving in the orange
[59:15] building. Uh I think you make um a good
[59:19] way of making that whole thing peaceful.
[59:23] If we Bitcoiners are and
[59:27] they're like, "Oh, like have fun staying
[59:29] poor in in the worst possible
[59:31] way, there's the higher chance of of uh
[59:35] a
[59:36] nonpaceful revolution and the way
[59:38] Bitcoin is getting adopted and the way
[59:41] Bitcoin is reacting to things. I think
[59:43] th those things actually matter uh in in
[59:46] the long run uh and and has some some
[59:50] trickle effects I think. Um, one other
[59:54] topic that I kind of wanted to get into
[59:56] with you was AI. Uh, as as an artist, do
[60:00] do you use it? And and how do you see
[60:02] the the connection between like AI and
[60:04] Bitcoin? Well, that's a good question. I
[60:06] do use AI for all kinds of stuff. Um, I
[60:10] do use it in my art. Absolutely. As
[60:11] well. Um, and I think it's just amazing.
[60:16] I think there's just so much that we can
[60:21] u leverage it it to better better our
[60:24] lives in so many ways. I do think this
[60:26] is another one of those tools that
[60:28] people can use. I think right now it's
[60:30] one of those things where it's exist in
[60:32] mostly walled gardens meaning that you
[60:34] have to use these trusted third parties
[60:36] like open AI or anthropic or the
[60:38] deepseek or whoever whoever is
[60:40] developing these things. Most people
[60:41] aren't running these these AI things at
[60:44] home or midjourney for the art art side
[60:46] of it and things like that. Most of the
[60:48] people aren't aren't capable or they're
[60:49] not open source to run at home. And even
[60:52] if you were running at home, it may take
[60:54] like a relatively large investment in
[60:57] infrastructure, meaning that you have to
[60:59] be careful what you feed into the
[61:00] machine. However, I think the uh the
[61:04] abilities that it gives you, it almost
[61:05] turns you into a super super person
[61:07] because um I've just learned so much
[61:10] from using it, it it basically can kind
[61:13] of help you research things and
[61:15] understand things better that you didn't
[61:17] understand and kind of give you like a
[61:19] little bit of a a more holistic um
[61:22] perspective in a tailored way rather
[61:24] than kind of Google searching for
[61:25] things. So, if you Google search for it,
[61:27] you may come up with uh certain
[61:29] information, but this is actually much
[61:31] more tailored to specifically what you
[61:33] asked. And for example, I'm doing an art
[61:37] thing right now. Nothing big. I just
[61:39] actually a lot of my machines have been
[61:41] down. I'm just trying to set stuff up
[61:42] and just I wanted to do a little fun
[61:44] design to to do on the thing and um you
[61:48] know, make sure it works. And I was able
[61:51] I want to go to this concert at the end
[61:53] of the month and I can't get tickets for
[61:54] it. it's actually sold out. So, I was
[61:56] like, "Oh, maybe I can make like a an
[61:58] art piece about the band and I'll just
[61:59] sit in the parking lot and try to like
[62:01] somebody give me a ticket for like a
[62:03] cool little art thing." Um, and so I
[62:06] took uh this band has played at the at
[62:10] this venue many different times and so I
[62:12] just took uh there's a database of all
[62:14] their information. So I just took the
[62:16] database and and downloaded it and then
[62:19] I used AI to do basically format the
[62:22] data and then start turning it into art.
[62:25] And it was just such a cool thing to see
[62:27] how I was able to just basically use the
[62:30] data uh to define what the the art
[62:33] actually looked like. So for example, I
[62:35] would say you know I want to show a
[62:37] circle with the top 50 songs that they
[62:39] played at this venue. I want the wi uh
[62:41] each song to be like a little different
[62:44] uh glyph. And I want the width of that
[62:46] glyph to be defined by how many times
[62:48] they played that song at the at that
[62:50] venue. And then I also want to show
[62:53] which years they played it in, you know,
[62:55] by the color of the by the color of the
[62:57] thing. And then it will give you some
[62:58] code and then it basically will it
[63:01] taught me, okay, here's here's the code.
[63:02] And then okay, well, what do I h how do
[63:04] I use this? Okay, well here well here's
[63:06] what you do. You just open up a text
[63:07] editor. You you dot this in there. you
[63:09] save it as as a HTML file and then you
[63:12] can set up a local server and you just
[63:14] put it like this and now you have your
[63:15] own website basically that's displaying
[63:16] this art and it's even neat because I
[63:19] could then start linking things and say
[63:21] hey well if I want to see every song
[63:22] that played in this year I want them all
[63:24] to be this color and uh you know it
[63:26] basically can help you set it up and
[63:28] then at first you don't even have to
[63:30] understand any of the code that it gives
[63:31] you just basically copy paste it and
[63:34] then just click enter and just see see
[63:36] what happens and sometimes it works and
[63:38] sometimes it doesn't if it doesn't you
[63:39] get an error and you tell it. If it
[63:41] does, it's like, man, this is amazing.
[63:42] You know, like I can't believe that this
[63:44] happened. And then if something's not
[63:46] right about it, you can actually like
[63:48] have it tell you like, oh, hey, well, I
[63:50] don't like this. I need to bring this up
[63:52] uh a little. It's overlapping something
[63:54] else or I need this thing to be vertical
[63:57] instead of horizontal. Tell me how to do
[63:59] that. So then it tells you how to like,
[64:01] oh, you go to this line in the code and
[64:02] you change this number. So you go from
[64:05] not understanding anything about that
[64:06] code to actually seeing like oh hey this
[64:09] is how it works and then you can start
[64:11] to go through it and then there's other
[64:13] things you can change that you didn't
[64:14] need to ask the AI for. You could
[64:15] actually just start figuring like oh
[64:17] like okay this is how it works and then
[64:18] that just changes your whole life
[64:20] because now you know how to do something
[64:21] that you didn't know how to do yesterday
[64:23] and the learning curve was so fast
[64:25] because it's just like all the
[64:26] individual little things uh were
[64:29] addressed. It's like well hey I don't
[64:31] understand what this is. Why why is
[64:32] that? And basically the thing explains
[64:34] it to you with the understanding that
[64:36] yes, sometimes these things hallucinate,
[64:38] sometimes they get it wrong. Um, so it
[64:40] takes a little working with it. So like
[64:42] as you're doing like this weird coding
[64:44] stuff with it, um, sometimes like what
[64:46] you do doesn't work or it does like an
[64:47] unexpected thing and and you just have
[64:49] to work with it and say like, "Hey, this
[64:51] is what happened. Like why is it doing
[64:52] this?" Or I got this error. But at one
[64:55] point I it it was doing something wrong,
[64:57] you know, like there was like some ring
[65:00] that I wanted and it just wasn't
[65:01] matching up uh with the with the ring
[65:03] above it. And I needed everything to be
[65:05] perfectly spaced and aligned and it
[65:07] should it should. There was no reason
[65:08] that the thing should and I was like
[65:10] what's wrong? Why aren't you getting
[65:11] this right? Like what like what are you
[65:13] trying to do here? And it gave me an
[65:16] explanation that was just so wild. that
[65:18] basically started creating equations
[65:20] based on the information that I gave it
[65:21] and like assigning different songs and
[65:23] names like variable numbers and this to
[65:26] the cube to that and it was doing like
[65:28] all these really wild like mathematics
[65:30] and I was like even though I got it
[65:32] wrong the level of this help that I'm
[65:35] getting is so amazing cuz like I
[65:37] couldn't hire somebody that's this smart
[65:39] to make the to make the to get the
[65:42] answer wrong. uh you know like like the
[65:45] level of this help is just so high that
[65:47] it's crazy you know it's like okay even
[65:49] though it's wrong the way that he got it
[65:52] wrong was just so beautiful and elegant
[65:53] and interesting that it's like man this
[65:56] is just a really interesting tool to
[65:58] leverage so uh you know you just keep
[66:00] working with it and I think there's all
[66:02] kinds of interesting things that artists
[66:03] can do with it for example another way
[66:05] that I use AI is if you want to do any
[66:08] kind of art say you want to draw a cat
[66:10] or whatever you'll usually go on to
[66:12] Google and search what a cat looks like,
[66:14] pictures of a cat, so you could then
[66:16] draw it so you know what you get your
[66:18] proportions right. However, some things
[66:20] you want to draw might not exist yet or
[66:23] you don't want to use like a copyrighted
[66:25] picture from someone else, for example.
[66:27] So, you can actually use AI to create
[66:29] reference images that just don't exist
[66:31] in the world. So, no one's ever actually
[66:33] seen this reference image before. And
[66:34] so, you use that to draw from and um or
[66:37] to actually pull shapes from. Sometimes
[66:39] it's like you'll be designing something
[66:40] and you uh say, "Hey, well, you know,
[66:43] show me show me a bunch of these type of
[66:45] things." And by looking at these weird
[66:47] AI, you know, hallucinations of what it
[66:50] thinks this subject that you have is,
[66:52] um, sometimes it gives you what you
[66:54] think you wanted. Um, and other times
[66:56] it'll give you a totally wild
[66:57] perspective that is related, but not
[66:59] what you had had originally assumed. But
[67:02] sometimes it leads you onto a new path
[67:04] that's that's actually very interesting.
[67:06] And uh and other times like it's just
[67:08] like a simple shape that you find. It's
[67:09] like oh hey there's this design. I
[67:11] really love the way that it put this
[67:12] there. That's just so cool and you just
[67:14] steal it cuz you just you know you take
[67:16] it from the AI which basically is
[67:18] working with you to come up with these
[67:20] things. Um, so yeah, I think there's a
[67:22] lot of interesting ways to use it, but
[67:24] it I mean I've used AI for the first
[67:27] very first time I used AI was uh it was
[67:29] I think one of the original chat GPT
[67:32] versions, but I had this guy that was uh
[67:36] going to lay a concrete slab at my house
[67:38] and he gave me a price that sounded
[67:39] ridiculous to me. I was like that just
[67:42] that sounds too much, you know. But I
[67:44] didn't know how to te like tell him
[67:45] because I don't know how to calculate
[67:46] the volume of concrete that like go it's
[67:49] like a it's a it's an it's an amount
[67:51] that's like an area volume that you have
[67:53] to calculate. So I didn't know how to do
[67:54] that. So I went to AI and I was like,
[67:56] "Hey, like if I have a concrete pad
[67:58] that's this this size and you know what
[68:00] what should be the amount of concrete
[68:02] that's that's going in there?" Cuz he
[68:04] was charging by the yard, I think. Like
[68:05] so it was like this much per yard and he
[68:07] gave me some amount that it just seemed
[68:08] ridiculous. And then when when the AI
[68:11] told me it was like way less than that
[68:13] and I was like, "Holy shit." I was like,
[68:14] "Well, how could I verify this?" And it
[68:16] was like, "Oh, well, you can go to
[68:16] this." And it turns out there's actually
[68:18] calculators online that you could just
[68:20] go and they'll tell you how to figure
[68:21] out the concrete slab thing. It's like
[68:23] totally a thing. I hadn't thought of
[68:25] that. But the the point of it is is that
[68:27] basically this guy wanted to overcharge
[68:29] me by thousands and thousands of dollars
[68:31] and my like 20 bucks that I had paid for
[68:33] the AI would just like totally paid off
[68:35] in the first day. So, ever since then,
[68:37] which was like I feel like 2022, I've
[68:39] been using it for all kinds of stuff,
[68:41] you know, just wild, you know, pretty
[68:43] much anything that I can think of from
[68:45] saving money to concrete to doing these
[68:47] wild data art
[68:49] things. It's the the use cases are
[68:53] unimaginable. It It's so fascinating. I
[68:56] I use it on a daily basis for emails. I
[69:00] I rarely write emails myself
[69:03] now. And uh I have uh folders for that.
[69:07] So it already knows exactly how I want
[69:09] to uh have emails written. Um I for
[69:14] anything that comes up that is not
[69:16] logical for me like hey like why I I got
[69:21] an invoice from my landlord and I was
[69:23] like I don't have to pay that. And I was
[69:26] like okay but I don't want to deal with
[69:27] that either. So I was just giving the
[69:31] the invoice and the message what I got
[69:34] from the landlord directly to the AI. Uh
[69:37] AI was like okay that that doesn't sound
[69:40] good. Let's write this
[69:41] back. And then uh I think two three days
[69:45] AI was writing basically with my
[69:47] landlord. I was not typing anything
[69:49] myself. Wow. And and and then at the end
[69:53] my landlord said oh you are right. I I
[69:56] will go back and and see if I can find
[69:59] like because he he he basically didn't
[70:02] provide uh good enough information to
[70:04] actually charge me that. Uh and it was
[70:07] not clear if he's able to charge me for
[70:09] that. And uh now he went back and like
[70:12] okay I have to see more about that. Uh
[70:16] and I I didn't hear back from my
[70:18] landlord since a month
[70:20] now. And and it was basically I think an
[70:23] invoice for like €300. And I was like, I
[70:27] I'm not paying an blank invoice without
[70:29] information. And I didn't do anything. I
[70:32] just gave the information from the
[70:34] landlord to the AI. And AI like I I was
[70:36] just I was just I was just seeing it. I
[70:40] had to copy and paste all the time. But
[70:42] uh that that's all I did.
[70:45] It's perfect use case. you know, it like
[70:47] reduces your frustration and you don't,
[70:49] you know, like you don't have to go
[70:50] through all those emotions of of writing
[70:52] it out and and it probably does a better
[70:54] job and doesn't forget things or miss,
[70:56] oh, I forgot to include this part, you
[70:58] know, it should for the most part get it
[71:00] good. That's amazing. And the thing that
[71:02] you just said is it doesn't has emotions
[71:05] because if emotions comes into play,
[71:07] you're like, oh, like why are you saying
[71:09] this to me? Like like humans are flawed
[71:12] with emotions.
[71:14] It's good that we have emotions, but
[71:16] sometimes it's bad that we have
[71:18] emotions. And in those situations, I
[71:20] just like to let let AI deal with it.
[71:23] It's basically um uh you know, before
[71:27] AI, you you you had to hire like an an
[71:31] an assistant or like an uh someone that
[71:34] comes from from college or from from a
[71:36] university and like, hey, like can can
[71:38] you deal with that? and you pay them, I
[71:39] don't know, like 2, three, $4,000 a
[71:42] month, whatever it is. And now you can
[71:44] get this, not the same, but a very
[71:47] similar in in most areas, very similar
[71:51] quality of work already uh for like 20
[71:54] bucks
[71:55] uh a month. And and I I don't get how
[71:58] people don't pay that. I'm like, 20
[72:00] bucks? That's that's nothing, right?
[72:03] Yeah. I mean, right there, that saved
[72:06] you 300 bucks on that one that one thing
[72:09] in your life, and that's just one
[72:11] interaction with it. It's like I'm sure
[72:12] you said you use it for all kinds of
[72:14] stuff. The value is so high. I think um
[72:16] I I really think these things are super
[72:19] cool. I I'm I'm excited for them to
[72:21] become I'm I really like the open-
[72:24] source models that they have and I think
[72:26] that it's going to be neat to see those
[72:28] come a long way, especially with the
[72:30] recent ones that seem to be competitive
[72:32] against the very closed source models.
[72:35] Um, we we've heard that there's no moat
[72:37] uh sometimes with the open source
[72:39] between the open source and the
[72:41] commercialized versions and and I think
[72:42] you now we're actually seeing that and
[72:45] um I I think the acceleration is so fast
[72:48] as well that it's just amazing if you
[72:51] see I saw a post the other day that
[72:53] showed the midjourney pictures that they
[72:55] were generating in version one which was
[72:57] sometime in 2022 and the ver you know
[72:59] stuff that they were producing towards
[73:01] the end of 2024 and it was like every 2
[73:03] or 3 months maybe they were releasing
[73:05] their new version or a version update
[73:08] and you could see significant
[73:10] differences from the same prompt that
[73:12] was put in. You know, at one point it
[73:14] basically looked like a you
[73:16] know, person painted it with their foot
[73:17] and then now it's like photorealistic
[73:19] where you can barely tell the difference
[73:21] between an actual photograph and whether
[73:24] you know some something created by one
[73:25] of these models. And um that just
[73:28] happened in the span of basically 2
[73:30] years. But the fact is is like every few
[73:32] months it just seems like we're we're
[73:34] seeing a relatively large jump. But even
[73:36] every week, you know, I I see some
[73:38] Twitter accounts that just say this week
[73:40] in AI and it's just like if you just
[73:41] look at those one one of their posts
[73:43] every every week in AI, there's like
[73:45] ridiculous amount of stuff going on
[73:46] because there's just so many different
[73:48] things going on in so many different
[73:50] facets. So we have just coding, we have
[73:54] uh art, you know, the visual arts, we
[73:56] have writing, uh you know, like people
[73:58] doing novels and things like that. Then
[73:59] we have the movies, the new AI movie
[74:02] thing that's been going on that's like
[74:03] huge right now. Now there's uh text to
[74:05] 3D. So you could do like a, you know, a
[74:08] text prompt and get a true 3D model that
[74:10] people are using in games and and um 3D
[74:12] printing and all kinds of stuff. That's
[74:14]  amazing. You know, you're going
[74:16] to have text to CAD. Like basically, you
[74:19] don't have to hire an engineer to do
[74:20] like part design for you. Say like,
[74:22] "Hey, I I broke this thing on my on my
[74:25] lawn mower and this is the basically
[74:27] piece that it is." And um even if they
[74:30] don't have that piece online, you just
[74:32] give it the measurements and it can
[74:33] probably model you of something that you
[74:34] can then then you have manufactured or
[74:37] make yourself and then go on your way. I
[74:40] mean it's it's these type of things like
[74:42] we kind of have heard say like in the 3D
[74:45] print revolution how 3D printing was
[74:47] going to change the world and whatnot.
[74:49] So sometimes you get these hit and
[74:50] misses. I I kind of don't feel like this
[74:52] AI thing is one of the hit and misses.
[74:54] It just seems like there's so many
[74:55] things happening in different in
[74:57] different uh like I said disciplines,
[75:00] but they're all like popping off and
[75:01] they're all kind of doing pretty good,
[75:03] you know, like and as you see time go
[75:05] on, it's you hear the people say like
[75:07] this is the worst it's ever going to be,
[75:09] you know, from here on out. It's like
[75:10] it's only getting better. So, it's
[75:12] really just kind of mindboggling, I
[75:14] think, to see what will the capabilities
[75:16] that we will have in just a few short
[75:18] years. 100%. And I I have empathy for
[75:22] the people that sleep on Bitcoin and AI.
[75:26] Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have a
[75:29] friend that was telling me like, you
[75:30] know, the people that don't use it are
[75:32] just falling behind. Uh and it's so true
[75:34] because it's like literally like having
[75:36] kind of like you said, it's like
[75:37] actually having an employee or a
[75:39] personal assistant that's there to help
[75:40] you and do the grunt work that you don't
[75:43] want to do but you need to do and get
[75:45] done and stuff. Like you need to send
[75:46] that email to the landlord. You don't
[75:48] want to pay the 300 bucks. Like this is
[75:49] actually like an employee that basically
[75:51] does it for you. Are you kidding me? You
[75:53] know, and for 20 bucks a month like you
[75:55] were saying. It's like crazy.
[75:56] Absolutely. It it's
[75:58] it's a cheat code. It's it's absolutely
[76:02] a cheat code. Um yeah, we have these
[76:04] cheat codes here. Bitcoin, psychedelics,
[76:06] AI.
[76:10] We have uh I have one question that I
[76:12] ask each and every one of my guests. Uh
[76:14] and the question is, what can we learn
[76:16] from you besides Bitcoin?
[76:20] Well, um I just think that maybe the my
[76:23] whole mission is just to tell people
[76:25] that there are tools out there, you
[76:27] know, in addition to Bitcoin. We just
[76:29] mentioned two other ones that you can
[76:31] use that help you be a more self-s
[76:33] sovereign individual. And I think the
[76:35] more self- sovereignty you can claw back
[76:37] from the world, the more agency you can
[76:39] take, the more time of your own you can
[76:41] harvest back from the attention seekers,
[76:43] the better off that you'll be. Um, I
[76:46] think you know like you can use the
[76:47] first principle uh thinking that comes
[76:50] from being a Bitcoiner and apply that
[76:53] across your life to everything else
[76:54] that's outside Bitcoin and you will just
[76:57] continue to reap reap rewards and
[76:59] benefits from these type of right
[77:01] actions. So think that I I I love that
[77:05] and it it perfectly fits to our Android
[77:07] team. Uh our Android is is is a question
[77:10] from previous the previous guest is
[77:12] asking a question for the next guest
[77:13] without knowing who the next guest is
[77:15] and the question just fits so nicely. Uh
[77:18] how has adopting Bitcoin changed your
[77:21] worldview? Adopting Bitcoin has
[77:22] definitely changed my worldview
[77:24] massively in two specific ways that I
[77:26] can think of. One, it just it created a
[77:29] longer time horizon in my thinking. So
[77:32] the art that I made pre Bitcoin I it was
[77:36] not something that I would think about.
[77:37] Oh, is this person going to have it for,
[77:40] you know, 100 years or something like
[77:42] that? That concept wasn't in my mind.
[77:43] You know, I was thinking like I was
[77:44] making art and basically people would
[77:46] take it home. They probably would put it
[77:47] on the shelf. Some people might put it
[77:48] up. But I didn't really think too too
[77:50] much about that or the the longevity of
[77:53] it or maybe somebody might want to pass
[77:54] that down to someone else in their
[77:56] family. Whereas now when I make an art
[77:58] piece, it's like I'm thinking in kind of
[78:00] Bitcoin terms, which is a much longer
[78:02] time frame, you know, at least going out
[78:04] to 2140. So, um, but it's like you think
[78:07] in in much longer time span than
[78:09] actually generations of families, not
[78:11] just the person buying it from you, but
[78:13] like everybody down the line. So, that's
[78:15] something that just totally was not
[78:17] there before Bitcoin. I didn't think at
[78:19] all like that. But now when I make an
[78:20] art piece, like I want to make something
[78:22] that somebody is going to want to hold
[78:23] and cherish for hundreds or thousands of
[78:26] years if possible. And I try to make it
[78:27] in materials that would make that
[78:29] possible, you know? So, like, as long as
[78:30] it's cared for properly, this should
[78:32] last a thousand years. So, you know,
[78:35] it's like that that type of thinking is
[78:38] new to me. So, that's certainly from
[78:39] Bitcoin. I also had some like health and
[78:41] dietary changes that that came through
[78:43] Bitcoin. Like social community stuff
[78:46] like I uh changed my diet. I used to be
[78:50] vegetarian for since like I don't know
[78:52] the year 2000. I was basically
[78:54] vegetarian all the way up until I think
[78:56] like 2023. And then I I had been hearing
[78:59] like meat stuff in the Bitcoin community
[79:01] for a while. And um at some point in
[79:04] October, I just switched over to
[79:06] carnivore and I basically have stayed
[79:07] that ever since um that time. So that
[79:11] was a huge change in my life to just
[79:13] kind of go from this one basically
[79:15] eating perspective to another. And that
[79:18] has brought all kinds of shifts in my
[79:20] mind like because I always thought I was
[79:22] eating healthy before as a vegetarian.
[79:24] My whole life I thought that was like
[79:25] healthy eating. And then I went I tried
[79:28] this for 30 days, you know, like the
[79:30] carnivore thing and it just like well I
[79:32] actually felt a lot better than I had
[79:34] before. And it was like man and I just
[79:36] maybe I should stick with this. So I
[79:38] kind of have have gone that route and
[79:42] I've actually felt so good that many
[79:43] times like man it's like you wonder what
[79:45] else in life you have been taught in
[79:48] quotes that's just
[79:49] completely inaccurate and that you
[79:52] bought into you know it's like for a
[79:54] huge amount of your life. So, uh, that's
[79:57] just one of those things that kind of
[79:58] Bitcoin like brought into my awareness
[80:00] and, uh, I just couldn't imagine this
[80:03] probably like a few years ago even if he
[80:05] told me, but it's just one of those
[80:06] things that just the community kind of
[80:08] bring brings up these non-Bitcoin
[80:10] related things sometimes that keep
[80:12] popping up and then uh, if you pay
[80:14] attention and look into it, kind of like
[80:16] you said, it's like there's certain
[80:17] things that you can ignore for a while,
[80:18] but if you are curious and you come
[80:20] across it with enough touch points from
[80:24] sources that you think are are
[80:25] relatively decent, then if you if you
[80:28] don't investigate, then it kind of falls
[80:29] on you at that point. And u to me, I
[80:32] don't know. I think it's like I tend to
[80:34] be extreme in some ways, but I do
[80:35] believe in the acid test and like what
[80:37] some people claim for themselves may not
[80:40] work for you. So, I saw, you know, like
[80:42] people making all these wow claims about
[80:44] the carnivore thing and I was like,
[80:45] well, I don't know if any of that's
[80:47]  or not, but the only way to
[80:48] find out is to give it a try. It doesn't
[80:50] seem like harmful. uh if especially if
[80:53] you do it on the short term and then uh
[80:56] yeah so I think that's the only way with
[80:58] a lot of stuff is to go go check it out
[81:00] if you think that there's merit or value
[81:02] for you
[81:03] there. That's interesting. The the if
[81:07] you're honest and if you are curious and
[81:10] you really investigate something like
[81:12] you you you will you you will discover
[81:15] there's a lot of things out there that
[81:17] society preaches that is actually not
[81:19] that good.
[81:20] that it's a whole different rabbit hole
[81:23] to go down. Um, thank you so much
[81:25] Fractal uh for for being on the show.
[81:28] Um, before I let you go, where can
[81:30] people find you, ask you questions and
[81:31] and reach out to you and see you out?
[81:34] Uh, well, they can find me on Twitter,
[81:36] which I guess is X now. Just look up
[81:38] Fractal Encrypt. It's one one word. Uh,
[81:41] and I also have a website,
[81:43] timechainartifacts.com, you can check
[81:44] out if you're interested in seeing some
[81:46] of the art. Thank you so much for being
[81:49] on. It was a pleasure. Thank you for
[81:50] taking the time. Also, thank you so much
[81:52] for everyone that is watching and
[81:54] listening, for joining us today. As
[81:56] always, I'll be back tomorrow with
[81:58] another episode. Bye-bye.
