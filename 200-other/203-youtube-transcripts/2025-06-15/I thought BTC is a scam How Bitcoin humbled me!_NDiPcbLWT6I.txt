[00:00] most people regret that they have not
[00:01] bought Bitcoin earlier and not more of
[00:03] it so with that being said you recognize
[00:06] Bitcoin before you could have already
[00:08] invested before this is a really
[00:10] humbling process that Bitcoin has has to
[00:12] go through because you have the
[00:14] humbleness to say I was wrong in the
[00:17] past and now I'm going into Bitcoin even
[00:19] though I said it's a scam even though I
[00:21] said it's a nonsense so many Bitcoin
[00:24] went through that exact thing Bitcoin
[00:26] actually humbles you you could pull out
[00:29] almost everyone that is willing to speak
[00:31] and put them on a camera and they would
[00:33] have something of value to share Bitcoin
[00:35] can only handle so much of stuff and so
[00:38] we have to build on top of that to bring
[00:41] all the applications and all the 8
[00:43] billion people onto Bitcoin no matter
[00:45] how many Bitcoins you have or how many
[00:46] Sates you have you have to get self
[00:48] custody otherwise you don't really own
[00:51] [Music]
[00:54] them today we will watch together an
[00:57] episode I did with groc Road news not a
[01:00] my podcast but on a podcast that was on
[01:04] Croc news where he interviewed me and
[01:06] this is I I will do that because I was
[01:11] guest on other shows so I can uh first
[01:14] give other shows uh a blat from here and
[01:17] I can dive deeper in what I said there
[01:20] and I can also give my opinion on what
[01:22] the host said and give more insights oh
[01:25] did I like it uh what can be improved uh
[01:28] and what can we dive deeper into the
[01:31] topics and maybe have some discussions
[01:33] there and most
[01:35] importantly um it's an older one so I
[01:39] can even react to my older self I
[01:42] recorded that episode with Croc news um
[01:46] I think it was three months ago or four
[01:48] months ago so it's it's been a while uh
[01:51] and I was even working back then I was
[01:54] uh still in my feeld job or I was right
[01:58] out my FEI job like it was something
[02:00] like that or maybe it was like in the
[02:01] week where I actually uh quit my feia
[02:04] job and uh then it's also interesting
[02:07] how did my view on bitcoin change over
[02:11] that period of time it would be really
[02:13] cool uh to watch the full uh interview
[02:15] together with you and yeah uh let's
[02:18] let's get into it um let's start it from
[02:21] the beginning with oh I was actually I
[02:24] see right now in the in the thing the
[02:26] Bitcoin path I in the beginning of my
[02:29] podcast of uh in the beginning of my
[02:31] beginning of my show I still called the
[02:34] whole podcast the Bitcoin path which
[02:37] right now it's just called Robin sire uh
[02:40] because uh yeah it's it's just me anyway
[02:43] so why should I put like some some fancy
[02:46] name above me if if if my name is Robin
[02:48] S so uh it's interesting here I was
[02:51] still the Bitcoin path now I'm actually
[02:54] just Robin S uh interesting to see that
[02:57] part of a history let's go into it and
[03:00] if it would not be for Bitcoin I would
[03:02] have maybe gone like complete offline
[03:04] and have no social media and no podcast
[03:07] and nothing else and then would just
[03:09] concentrate on like making money and
[03:11] preserving it with the stock market you
[03:13] can
[03:14] just no I would not have done that I
[03:18] would definitely go on the social media
[03:22] route everyone out on the Bitcoin
[03:25] conference and just interview him
[03:28] because people that are now interested
[03:30] in Bitcoin and they're even spending
[03:32] money on a Bitcoin conference ticket
[03:35] they know a lot of stuff and they have a
[03:37] unique View and it's so interesting
[03:38] that's why I like to being on
[03:40] conferences and meetups because you talk
[03:43] with bitcoiners you talk with people
[03:46] that are coming to those Bitcoin
[03:47] conferen and they all have like a unique
[03:49] view a unique perspective on it that's
[03:52] amaz that's uh I will I will not uh do
[03:55] so many reactions definitely uh will be
[03:57] interesting to see uh when we go in
[04:00] there but uh one thing I want to note
[04:02] here when I interview bitcoiners there
[04:07] are some that a little bit more boring
[04:09] there are some that are really
[04:10] interesting that I never heard of before
[04:12] that did did their first podcast and
[04:14] they from the first podcast onwards
[04:17] really interesting and have a lot to say
[04:20] and really interesting insights um but
[04:23] the thing is there are so many great
[04:26] people and when you go to a Bitcoin
[04:29] media meet up when you go to a Bitcoin
[04:31] conference you could pull out almost
[04:34] everyone that is willing to speak and
[04:36] put them on a camera and they would have
[04:38] something of value to share it of course
[04:41] it depends on on the variance but they
[04:44] they would have some insights because
[04:45] bitcoiners are really critical thinkers
[04:48] and they are deep Learners they're going
[04:50] deep on subjects and you just have to
[04:52] find out what subject they know best
[04:55] about and then go deep there and that's
[04:58] kind of what I do with my podcast
[05:00] because I have now 150 episodes recorded
[05:04] I will record now when I go to bitcoin
[05:06] BR soon now when this comes out Bitcoin
[05:08] prag was already uh but uh I will I will
[05:12] now go to bitcoin prag and uh there are
[05:15] so many uh great people there I will do
[05:18] five podcasts there in person just in
[05:21] the three days that I'm there will be
[05:23] really interesting you see I'm I'm
[05:24] looking forward uh to it build it's the
[05:29] the best solution uh for being the base
[05:32] layer of our financial system this is
[05:35] something like we build now the tcpip
[05:38] protocol of the internet this is Bitcoin
[05:40] Bitcoin is not a technology it's not
[05:43] this or that it's just a protocol where
[05:45] we can build on top of
[05:52] [Music]
[05:54] it hello everyone welcome to another
[05:57] episode of our podcast and today today
[05:59] I'm so happy because uh this Our Guest

[06:13] he get the time to do all the things
[06:15] that he does because he's posting like
[06:17] five six videos per week something that
[06:20] for me is quite impossible I've been
[06:22] following him since uh probably one year
[06:25] ago and I I was uh very very very
[06:30] like engag with with his content and
[06:32] also I saw that many times Michael
[06:34] sailor tag pictures of him and and and

[07:05] story is very well documented in his ex
[07:07] that we will share uh the tag to to for
[07:10] you to visit it and he heard about
[07:12] Bitcoin in
[07:14] 2017 and thought he was it was a scam
[07:17] until 2020 similar than Michael sailor
[07:20] then he went into it and L and took him
[07:23] a year to go all in with with Bitcoin
[07:26] and now in 2024 he is more oing in
[07:29] Bitcoin even he quit his shop he has a

[07:52] hello thank you for inviting me Fernanda
[07:54] thank you for coming just was this this
[07:56] project was like he contacted our my
[07:59] business partner first then we were
[08:01] supposed to do some podcast and upload
[08:04] at the same time in in both YouTube
[08:06] account but I say no better do one your
[08:09] style one my style and let the algorith
[08:13] think that we are like just stealing so
[08:16] and as he is full 100% fulltime on
[08:19] bitcoin he has the time to to come to to
[08:21] our podcast today so thanks again for
[08:24] being here yes s I'm actually right now
[08:27] in the process of uh turning down my
[08:29] Shob and ramping up fulltime uh Bitcoin
[08:32] content creation Bitcoin working with
[08:34] Bitcoin companies I work really closely
[08:36] with 21 Bitcoin uh and uh yeah it's it's
[08:40] it's an honor to have this kind of uh
[08:43] job that you can work for Bitcoin uh
[08:46] fulltime until now I made it like that I
[08:49] work parttime and on the weekends for
[08:52] Bitcoin as you mentioned I have five
[08:54] podcasts that I publish every week five
[08:57] podcasts a week uh is like one hour of
[08:59] preparation for the guest one hour and a
[09:01] half to record it and post production
[09:04] and stuff like that so like with five it
[09:06] accumulates really quickly so it's
[09:09] really nice now that I can focus full
[09:11] time on bitcoin I think the focus and
[09:14] it's it's even uh if it's it's even more
[09:17] with seven per week uh so now I do seven
[09:20] like every day actually every day when I
[09:22] say every day most people think that I
[09:25] do five a day uh five a week with Monday
[09:28] to uh Friday but I actually do like
[09:30] Monday through Sunday Saturday and
[09:33] Sunday for me it's also working day uh
[09:35] one thing that I uh I got to know about
[09:38] before like before the interview started
[09:41] in in the trailer it was uh the tcpip
[09:44] protocol this is something really
[09:46] interesting this is the the thing that I
[09:48] always say Bitcoin is the tcpip protocol
[09:52] this is something that I've been saying
[09:54] for a long time this is something that
[09:56] I've said like years years ago one two
[10:00] years ago because years ago I was not in
[10:03] in Bitcoin anyways and the TCP protocol
[10:07] comparison basically is when we have um
[10:11] TCP and then we have all the other
[10:13] layers on top of that so Facebook is not
[10:16] the layer one technology there's
[10:18] something underneath it all and then
[10:21] there's Underneath It All and then the
[10:23] layers spilled on top of each other and
[10:25] when we now come to uh Bitcoin Bitcoin
[10:28] can only handle so much of stuff and so
[10:32] we have to build on top of that to bring
[10:35] all the applications and all the 8
[10:37] billion people onto
[10:38] Bitcoin or everything will not be on the
[10:42] base layer this will not be happening
[10:45] and I'm also because he also talked
[10:47] about Michel saor and how he tagged me
[10:50] in in in in pictures now I'm actually
[10:52] interviewing him on my podcast soon uh
[10:55] actually in person in brag I'm looking
[10:57] really forward to that and this is also
[10:59] one of be one of my questions I I think
[11:01] this will be one of my questions that
[11:04] still have to figure out how many
[11:05] questions I can I can get into like this
[11:07] one two hour that I have with him but I
[11:10] think this is one of my question that I
[11:12] have how the future of Bitcoin of
[11:15] scaling Bitcoin looks like and what
[11:16] applications we can build on top because
[11:18] micro strategy also with micro strategy
[11:20] orange is now building something on top
[11:22] of Bitcoin which is really exciting that
[11:24] they're not only talking about Bitcoin
[11:26] not only uh investing in in Bitcoin but
[11:30] now also building in Bitcoin which is
[11:32] amazing uh I love it a lot what they're
[11:35] doing uh and will be interesting what
[11:37] they're building and what they are doing
[11:39] there exactly and yeah this is uh uh
[11:43] basically it with the CCP protocol
[11:45] Bitcoin is the base layer of our
[11:48] financial
[11:50] world will allow me to uh be even more
[11:54] integrated in the Bitcoin community and
[11:57] maybe uh have even more value for the
[12:00] Bitcoin Community yes and this is
[12:02] something that that I we are like
[12:04] interviewing people who have have
[12:06] podcast who have like um other
[12:09] newsletters and for us we are not
[12:11] competitors we are all parts of the same
[12:14] community and I think that everyone from
[12:16] from their their site or their project
[12:20] adds value to this Bitcoin community
[12:22] that is super young we are super early
[12:25] so let's start with the interview and I
[12:29] don't ask to because if you're bitcoiner
[12:32] you don't ask how many Bitcoins you have
[12:34] but I like to ask how are
[12:38] you uh that was an interesting story and
[12:40] then you mentioned it in the in the in
[12:42] the introduction that I thought Bitcoin
[12:44] is a scam for three years uh because I
[12:48] was in this War Buffet mindset I was
[12:50] like Bitcoin is uh not useful for
[12:54] society because it has no cash flow that
[12:55] was such a stupid F of mine but but I
[12:59] had it I was really in that it has to
[13:01] have a cash flow it has to have some
[13:03] something that works for me and this is
[13:07] usually stocks and I was actually quite
[13:09] successful with with stocks I had some
[13:12] really really good gainers in there uh
[13:14] but the overall problem that I wanted to
[13:18] solve uh especially also for other
[13:21] people that are in uh my environment
[13:23] that came up to me like how do you do it
[13:25] with stocks how do you pick stocks and
[13:27] stuff like that the overall problem I
[13:29] always wanted to solve even though I
[13:31] didn't knew it at the time was how do I
[13:34] store my wealth uh and how to PR
[13:37] preserve my wealth through storing that
[13:40] uh that in in some some vehicle and this
[13:43] is actually not as easy as it seems just
[13:46] like oh yeah I work and I get energy how
[13:48] do I save it and I started this process
[13:52] with like 18 years old I got some extra
[13:55] money from Grandma uh like was like few
[13:59] 100 or something like that and I was
[14:01] like I have everything I don't need
[14:03] anything more like I don't I I was
[14:06] always a savings person like because I
[14:08] was young I had a roof over my head
[14:10] because of my parents I I I had uh
[14:13] everything that I need for like food and
[14:15] shelter and all this stuff uh and I was
[14:18] never the type of guy that was like
[14:20] wanted fancy things other people would
[14:22] have gone out and bought like maybe the
[14:24] newest phone or like a PlayStation or
[14:26] something I don't know uh but I was like
[14:29] H what can I do with the money and first
[14:31] all like let's put it in a savings
[14:33] account this did not do a lot it was
[14:36] just like laying there I think the the
[14:39] rates was like
[14:41] 0.01% I got like a few cents every
[14:44] quarter uh and uh then I was like let's
[14:48] let's let's do something else with it
[14:50] and then I was researching about um
[14:53] index FS ETFs and all those uh stuffs
[14:57] and I bought some ETF it got me like 2%
[15:02] uh profit in a year and with all the
[15:06] fees I had to pay it was almost zero so
[15:09] the fees took everything away from me
[15:12] and then over such over like a small
[15:15] period of time I was like let's let's
[15:18] figure out the stocks like can I can I
[15:21] invest in stocks can I pick stocks and
[15:24] yeah and then I went ahead and and
[15:27] picked stocks that was really terrible
[15:28] at first then I was better and better
[15:32] over time and the interesting thing I
[15:34] was really successful in like the last
[15:37] few like in the last few years where and
[15:40] the main thing here is uh what I'm
[15:42] trying to convey in a very long uh way
[15:46] that it's my usual way of speaking I
[15:48] speak very long and and make a lot of
[15:51] points but the main thing here that I
[15:53] wanted to uh get away and and and and
[15:56] put really down is
[15:59] if you genuinely try to get your savings
[16:04] in a correct way then you when you
[16:08] recognize the problem of how do I secure
[16:11] my financial energy you will figure out
[16:15] Bitcoin eventually and this is kind of
[16:16] the the way that I'm talking towards my
[16:20] history I started out with the savings
[16:22] then I got into stocks and ETFs and all
[16:25] the other crap that I was in there and
[16:28] it eventually I got to bitcoin and I
[16:30] think everyone that genuinely asks this
[16:33] question where can I store my financial
[16:38] energy will eventually come to bitcoin
[16:42] that there's no like how can you come to
[16:45] anything else at this
[16:48] points picking like picking individual
[16:51] stocks and I was invested in in Tesla in
[16:55] the huge runup like in a really really
[16:57] huge runup I think
[16:59] I don't know it was like over th%
[17:01] actually gain with Tesla alone uh there
[17:04] was also some losers in there so like it
[17:06] was not like a big because like in a
[17:08] portfolio you always have some losers
[17:10] and some winners in there and then from
[17:13] that moment onwards uh it was like 2017
[17:17] to 2020 I was investing in stocks and
[17:19] then in 2020 more and more people kept
[17:22] asking me hey what is this Bitcoin thing
[17:23] you are doing good in the stock market
[17:26] why don't you have any allocation to
[17:27] bitcoin and then there was one friend we
[17:29] discussed about Bitcoin and I discovered
[17:33] that in the discussion with him I
[17:35] discovered that I actually don't have
[17:38] too too good I don't have good arguments
[17:41] against Bitcoin and on that thought I
[17:44] was like I want to prove him wrong and
[17:46] this was like a Friday afternoon
[17:48] discussion with him and then I went
[17:51] ahead and went home and this weekend I
[17:53] had no no plans really so I just went
[17:57] home and Saturday Sunday
[17:59] no plans cancelled everything that I had
[18:02] like small things and then I was like
[18:04] yeah let's let's dive deep into Bitcoin
[18:07] to prove my friend wrong so I can call
[18:09] him on Monday and tell him what's wrong
[18:11] with Bitcoin the funny thing is on
[18:14] Sunday evening I was like that's maybe
[18:17] something like that's maybe I am the one
[18:21] that's wrong here and on Monday I
[18:24] created my coinbase account I thought at
[18:27] that time this is the most the the best
[18:29] exchange and this is another amazing
[18:32] point I have no clue how long will this
[18:35] video go when I interrupt myself so much
[18:38] but I think it's important to note here
[18:41] um almost everyone that comes into
[18:45] Bitcoin saw Bitcoin before so they saw
[18:49] Bitcoin at like maybe 2016 and then they
[18:52] came into in 2019 2020 whatever the time
[18:55] frame is uh they probably seen Bitcoin
[18:58] before they came in
[18:59] only rarely people are like ah I see
[19:02] Bitcoin let's directly jump into it all
[19:05] in and let's invest through really a lot
[19:07] most people regret that they have not
[19:09] bought Bitcoin earlier and not more of
[19:11] it so with that being said you
[19:14] recognized Bitcoin before you could have
[19:16] already invested before this is a really
[19:19] humbling process that Bitcoin Bitcoin
[19:22] has has to go through because you have
[19:25] the humbleness to say I was wrong and in
[19:28] the past and now I and now I'm going
[19:32] into Bitcoin even though I said it's a
[19:34] scam even though I said it's a nonsense
[19:37] uh and so many Bitcoin went through that
[19:40] exact thing uh
[19:43] so without uh without being too dramatic
[19:46] but uh Bitcoin actually humbles you uh
[19:48] and this will stop at some point because
[19:50] Bitcoin will be so obvious and and and
[19:53] and there's like peer pressure and
[19:55] there's like a lot of adoption coming to
[19:58] bitcoin in in in a totally different way
[20:01] so this humbling process I don't think
[20:03] will continue forever um I might be
[20:05] wrong here actually uh but it it will
[20:08] continue for sometime
[20:14] definitely again I was wrong but at
[20:16] least I got some Bitcoin from that in
[20:18] the first week this is also I think
[20:20] different to many other people uh in the
[20:22] first week I bought my ledger like in
[20:24] the first week I ever got into Bitcoin I
[20:28] instantly knew that this is something
[20:30] important to put your uh Bitcoin in self
[20:33] custody I didn't knew why it was
[20:35] important but uh I felt like I want to
[20:38] try everything out in the Bitcoin
[20:40] ecosystem so instantly in the first week
[20:42] I bought my ledger and I put everything
[20:45] like I bought 100 EUR with it 100 of
[20:48] Bitcoin and then I put my 100 of Bitcoin
[20:51] on The Ledger and then because I wanted
[20:53] to try it out I did also the reverse
[20:56] from like bank account to coinbase to
[20:59] Ledger 50 of that I put back from uh The
[21:03] Ledger to coinbase account again back to
[21:06] the bank I just wanted to familiarize
[21:08] with everything and see how it works and
[21:10] this was basically the orange pilling
[21:12] moment I wanted to prove my friend wrong
[21:15] and the funny thing is from that moment
[21:18] onwards it took me a year from having a
[21:20] big uh and this is another point that I
[21:24] want to to to make uh and not to like
[21:27] only call out my my sponsor um with with
[21:29] bitbox now I was in Ledger before now
[21:32] I'm in bitbox um uh and and I I like the
[21:36] company a lot I like the employees there
[21:37] a lot I'm in contact with them and
[21:39] obviously they are my sponsors uh so
[21:42] taking with a grain of salt but I I I
[21:44] personally love them and I personally
[21:45] use them I lik it a lot uh I will also
[21:50] maybe let me know in the comments if if
[21:51] you are interested in me making a video
[21:54] about self- custody I've gained a lot of
[21:57] insights uh through my interviews also
[22:00] when I talked with with the bitcoiners
[22:03] offline uh not recorded because some
[22:06] share a little bit more when when when
[22:08] the camera is not on and it's not
[22:10] recorded uh so I I'm I think I should um
[22:14] really share a stepbystep guide on oh
[22:18] you have so many Bitcoins that should be
[22:20] your self custody plan uh and and this
[22:23] is what I'm I will probably try to do in
[22:27] in in some amount of time when I can get
[22:31] into it but uh the most important point
[22:34] is get self cust some some some way uh
[22:38] it's it's it's no matter how many
[22:40] Bitcoins you have or how many satosi you
[22:42] have you have to get self custody
[22:44] otherwise you don't really own them uh
[22:47] and yes I'm aware that at some point we
[22:49] will move to Layer Two and most of them
[22:52] will move to Layer Two because not
[22:53] everyone will uh will will be able to
[22:56] compete for the layer one face but even
[22:59] on Layer Two there is uh non-custodial
[23:02] and custodial Solutions so be even on
[23:05] Layer Two with with sof custody it's way
[23:07] better than to keep it on Exchange or
[23:10] anything stupid like
[23:13] that portfolio and 100 EUR really small
[23:18] allocation to bitcoin to going all in in
[23:21] Bitcoin in 2021 then I was all in and
[23:24] this was the crazy time the one year to
[23:28] get educated because then you you read
[23:31] every weekend you watch podcast you
[23:34] you're going really deep in the rabbit
[23:35] hole and Michael sailor was uh also
[23:39] really um um yeah forming Mike forms
[23:43] about that and opening up a lot of
[23:46] thoughts because I think I came from the
[23:48] stock world and he as a CEO of a public
[23:51] traded company talks to investors like
[23:54] he he knows how to talk to
[23:56] investors uh Anthony pum piano now I
[23:59] don't like him as much uh but at the
[24:03] time he also gave me a lot of insights
[24:06] and learned a lot and um the Andreas
[24:10] antonoplos he was also someone and the
[24:14] final one was the Bitcoin standard for
[24:16] me once I heard that one it was a little
[24:19] later in in in my journey I think um end
[24:23] of 2020 maybe uh this was like the final
[24:26] nail in the coffin then I was like this
[24:28] is it uh and from that moment onwards I
[24:31] was like orange build and then we can go
[24:34] ahead a little bit F even like the
[24:36] orange build moment in 2021 when I got
[24:39] all in in Bitcoin 2023 I started taking
[24:43] my Bitcoin Twitter account seriously I
[24:47] Grew From 400 uh in the beginning from
[24:49] last year to now 9,300 ,400 something
[24:54] that I have now uh yeah and in middle of
[24:57] the year started also video formats uh
[25:00] and then in December I started my
[25:02] podcast like it's now not old because
[25:05] now it's February and in December I
[25:08] started my podcast I already interviewed
[25:11] really really cool guys uh and not even
[25:13] like only this the the big one is like
[25:15] there's so many small Bitcoin blabs out
[25:19] there that I interviewed with like a 100
[25:21] followers uh that uh um I think my third
[25:26] interview opened my eyes a little bit
[25:28] uh he said Bitcoin is a system based on
[25:31] love and this was something I never
[25:33] heard before but he explained it so well
[25:36] and so it's like uh even like Jeff po of
[25:39] course was on Lena s you yourself was on
[25:42] like a lot of really cool guys were on
[25:45] uh but uh you always heard them before
[25:49] so for me it's uh really interesting to
[25:52] hear even the smaller greaters that uh
[25:55] the first time on their in their life on
[25:57] the podcast I had
[25:58] already five guests on that were the
[26:00] first time on a podcast on my podcast
[26:03] and this is something also really
[26:05] amazing but of course Jeff Bo and Lina
[26:07] sa and all all those guys were they are
[26:09] more experienced they have knowledge so
[26:12] much to share there's everything every
[26:15] time you hear them talk something new in
[26:17] there yeah so my really long orange ping
[26:20] story sorry I'm going no it's it's like
[26:22] it's good because everyone has a
[26:24] different different orange pill and and
[26:27] you are the first one that starts the
[26:29] orange feeling like trying to prove your
[26:31] friend that was wrong about Bitcoin
[26:33] because until now I I all the guys that
[26:36] I interview the most of them like they
[26:40] they went 100% with with with
[26:43] sailor I I don't know if I'm the only
[26:46] one I think probably I'm not the only
[26:48] one who got orange built by Pro trying
[26:51] to prove someone wrong it's a diff
[26:54] difficult process to go through when you
[26:56] go with the mindset in learning
[26:58] something uh and you want to prove
[27:00] someone
[27:02] wrong uh and then you're like oh [ __ ]
[27:04] I'm wrong I proved I proved myself wrong
[27:08] uh and I think this is something that's
[27:10] not not easy uh at the time it was not
[27:14] that bad actually for me it was like oh
[27:16] okay I was wrong about that but as As
[27:19] Time grows on and you get more
[27:21] experience and you learn more it kind of
[27:24] got it gets for some reason and there's
[27:27] not a good reason for that for some
[27:29] reason it gets more difficult uh to
[27:31] overcome your past issues will be yeah
[27:35] but I'm definitely probably not the only
[27:38] one here I'm not I'm not that unique but
[27:41] I appreciate it many of them also heard
[27:45] about Bitcoin in the early Beginnings
[27:47] like me but thought that was took us
[27:50] long time to understand what was really
[27:52] Bitcoin but you are the first one but
[27:55] everyone of us trusting Bitcoin from the
[27:57] day C
[27:58] but you are the first one that thought
[27:59] that Bitcoin was a scamm and trying to
[28:02] prove them wrong you discover that it's
[28:05] not a scam and you are now 100% into
[28:07] Bitcoin and this is great because that's
[28:09] the the way the things because sometimes
[28:11] you say okay this is a scam but you say
[28:14] this is a scam because most of the
[28:15] people say that something is a scam but
[28:18] when you study then you get your
[28:20] conclusion probably your conclusion is
[28:21] that this is scam and probably your
[28:23] conclusion is that it's not in your case
[28:27] you discover a different world yeah it's
[28:30] also interesting because when you study
[28:31] something you can always find an
[28:33] argument for everything and I didn't
[28:36] wanted to just find an argument to uh
[28:39] prove friend wrong I really want to
[28:42] wanted to understand it so I searched
[28:46] why Bitcoin why does Bitcoin make sense
[28:48] like I intentionally uh searched for the
[28:52] other side because I was on that side
[28:55] and I didn't wanted to have confirmation
[28:57] bias with having just like hearing from
[29:01] people that has have my opinion because
[29:04] when you just Google Bitcoin is Bitcoin
[29:06] a good idea is Bitcoin a bad idea you
[29:08] can go a deep uh Road also down where
[29:12] you end up like ah yes Bitcoin is a scam
[29:15] if you are listening to this podcast you
[29:17] might be wondering what is actually the
[29:19] setup look like of Robin or how can I
[29:22] improve my Bitcoin setup and there's two
[29:24] things you have to buy Bitcoin from the
[29:26] right source and you have to store
[29:28] Bitcoin the right way let's focus on the
[29:30] first thing how to buy Bitcoin it's
[29:32] simple have a Bitcoin only exchange
[29:35] don't deal with the shitcoin exchanges
[29:37] don't deal with an exchange that has an
[29:38] own token or something like that be on a
[29:41] Bitcoin only exchange I use 21 Bitcoin
[29:44] 21 Bitcoin is for me the best partner
[29:47] for that and now where do you store
[29:49] Bitcoin Bitcoin should be stored on a
[29:51] harder wallet on a self custody solution
[29:55] where you yourself hold your keys and it
[29:58] should be a cold wallet so that's my
[30:01] Simple Solutions that's a bitbox you
[30:04] just put your Bitcoin on there back up
[30:06] your seat fras and you are better than
[30:09] 95% of all Bitcoin hodlers if you have
[30:12] more than a, Euros in Bitcoin it's a
[30:15] absolutely must have I think this is
[30:18] what um most of the time happens with
[30:21] bitcoiners or not non bitcoiners or [ __ ]
[30:24] coiners um they get they see Bitcoin and
[30:29] then they get in a bubble outside of the
[30:32] Bitcoin bubble uh and in their bubble
[30:36] there are a lot of arguments that mostly
[30:39] are completely BS uh but some have
[30:44] some some value to it they have some
[30:47] legitimacy uh to do their um yeah to
[30:51] their argument uh but most of them are
[30:54] completely BS when you have that
[30:56] situation and you come into that
[31:00] group the interesting thing is if you
[31:03] are completely objective and you see the
[31:06] arguments by itself by its facts then
[31:11] you know it's [ __ ] but there are a
[31:12] lot of people saying that and if a lot
[31:14] of people saying something we are humans
[31:16] are weirdly W if a lot of people say
[31:19] something we just take it for granted
[31:21] you're like oh yeah it's it's it's true
[31:23] if everyone in your family in your close
[31:26] environment is safe saying one thing
[31:29] about a like One Direction about one
[31:31] thing you are really inclined in
[31:34] believing that uh but it's not always
[31:37] the case uh and that's uh why I Kudos
[31:40] those bitcoiners that broke out of that
[31:42] feared mindset about all that shitcoin
[31:45] crypto mindset and I love having that
[31:47] podcast with so many so many great
[31:49] mindset actually broke out of exactly
[31:51] that
[31:53] system you can take this road down but I
[31:57] intentionally wanted to find out about
[31:59] why Bitcoin makes sense because even if
[32:03] even if we not like if I wanted to
[32:06] prepare for an Bitcoin versus ethereum
[32:09] um debate I would study the other side
[32:13] really carefully because this is how
[32:16] they think and when you know how the
[32:18] other side thinks you can better uh
[32:20] debate and uh argue against the other
[32:24] side but in preparation of of that I
[32:28] discovered the other side uh and uh was
[32:31] switching to the other side slowly and
[32:34] this this is uh also like something I
[32:36] wanted to give to every listener is
[32:39] always be open to everything and never
[32:43] close your eyes like of course we have
[32:45] to call out [ __ ] coins that there are
[32:47] scams and stuff like that but we should
[32:49] never be like uh I will not talk about
[32:53] this at all like we should always be
[32:56] open although believe that all alt coins
[32:59] are [ __ ]
[33:00] coins but we still have to be open to
[33:03] everything this is something that we
[33:04] were my business partner was telling me
[33:07] the other day because I'm a little bit
[33:10] EXT extremist with the things that I I I
[33:13] don't like and the other day we were in
[33:15] a we were in a the Bitcoin Meetup in
[33:17] Hong Kong that that is once a month and
[33:20] there was a guy pitching some shitcoin
[33:22] uh and he was in the right place and I
[33:25] was like making fun of him and then my
[33:27] business said you need to listen to the
[33:29] person even though you know that this
[33:30] like a like it's a scam try to find the
[33:33] way try don't be so skeptical because
[33:36] probably you end up I don't know
[33:39] discovering something and the good thing
[33:40] that you say if you want to do a debate
[33:43] between Bitcoin and ethereum you're
[33:44] going to study a lot of ethereum to see
[33:48] yes what is the difference because there
[33:49] is a book about what that that is the
[33:51] Art of War that you need to know the
[33:55] enemy 100% even though like ethereum is
[33:58] not the enemy but if if you go to argue
[34:01] against something you need to study a
[34:03] lot the thing to understand what it is
[34:06] yeah
[34:07] definitely I would make the argument
[34:09] that ethereum is an enemy of Bitcoin um
[34:12] it takes like there are two sides it
[34:15] first of all I think that all the
[34:17] altcoins ethereum all Solano every all
[34:20] the altcoins basically are a test net
[34:23] for Bitcoin we've seen that in history
[34:26] uh something getss uh tried out out
[34:28] there and and and we can see if we can
[34:30] try it out on bitcoin or not um but
[34:33] honestly um and then there's argument
[34:36] that a test net has some kind of value
[34:39] like if it's actually a test net uh it
[34:41] can have some value but I don't know if
[34:43] we even need it I don't know if we need
[34:45] that test net I don't know if if we
[34:47] actually need a test net for Bitcoin
[34:50] because Bitcoin is actually quite great
[34:51] and uh you should not experiment too
[34:54] much with the Bas layer anyways uh so in
[34:58] sense I'm
[34:59] saying why why that test net is even
[35:02] existing so on a more broader scale
[35:06] ethereum uh steals away a little bit of
[35:09] the focus and steals away is serves as a
[35:13] distraction for the overall Bitcoin
[35:17] Mission and it's not bad because it
[35:20] might uh slow down the process of
[35:22] Bitcoin adoption and might slow down
[35:24] this this Fiat system collapsing a
[35:26] little bit uh in a broader sense um and
[35:30] it's not bad because I always make that
[35:32] that tenic um example also where you you
[35:35] don't want the tianic to sink too fast
[35:38] so the other people are able or the
[35:41] people on the Titanic are able to get on
[35:44] the live rafts on the live boats on the
[35:47] live whatever uh and you can save them
[35:51] because if the feat system sinks like in
[35:54] the next few weeks or months then we
[35:56] have a bigger problem s than Bitcoin uh
[35:59] and and ethereum and all all those
[36:01] things Bitcoin will be a life ref but
[36:04] not a lot of people will be like on
[36:05] board it in just a few weeks so that
[36:07] that will be the Titanic should snc
[36:11] slowly slowly slowly there's a saying
[36:14] like hold your friends close and your
[36:16] enemies even closer something like that
[36:19] yeah that that's and and and when and
[36:22] when because your journey is like so
[36:24] great because you started you discover
[36:26] Bitcoin at you thought it was a scam
[36:29] then you discover like as most of the
[36:31] new people like during the the the 2021
[36:36] 2020 during the pandemic um based on
[36:39] Sailor I think that sailor was the first
[36:42] person because until sailor we had the
[36:45] people that was so technical some
[36:47] Economist that we didn't understand what
[36:50] really was Bitcoin unless you were so
[36:52] into Austrian economics but sailor was
[36:55] the one that bring the Bitcoin and put
[36:58] on on Earth and explain what it was and
[37:02] um and also you you start doing a great
[37:04] career in the content creation space and
[37:08] and when you started and why did you
[37:11] started the this project of of content
[37:14] creation because you come from a tot
[37:17] totally different angle that is the the
[37:19] software development so how why and when
[37:23] did you started with this educational
[37:25] content that's an interesting question
[37:27] because um I started creating content
[37:31] around the stocks in 2020
[37:36] and at part of me already wanted to stop
[37:40] content trading and stop social media
[37:44] totally and if it would not be for
[37:46] Bitcoin I would have maybe gone like
[37:49] complete offline and have no social
[37:50] media no podcast and nothing else and we
[37:53] just concentrate on like making money
[37:55] and preserving it with the stock market
[37:59] uh
[38:00] and I did not find a lot that I I don't
[38:04] think it's the case anymore I I think um
[38:07] even if Bitcoin wasn't there uh I would
[38:10] probably make like Financial content I
[38:12] would make content how to pick stocks
[38:14] and stuff like that because this is what
[38:16] I really was passionate about I'm still
[38:18] passionate about picking stocks actually
[38:20] I just don't do it anymore because right
[38:22] now the best value is in Bitcoin but
[38:25] Bitcoin will be at some point Bor
[38:27] or not as valuable anymore or way more
[38:32] valuable than now but not as fast
[38:35] growing anymore so then it makes maybe
[38:38] sense to reinvest something in in the in
[38:41] the stock market uh maybe reinvest
[38:44] something in inventure capitalist uh
[38:46] stuff maybe reinvest something in
[38:48] companies stocks whatever it is uh it
[38:51] makes a lot of fun to stay up till 2: in
[38:53] the 2: a.m. in the morning because I'm
[38:55] in in in Austria and and I listen to the
[38:59] companies in America to the stock calls
[39:02] in in the earning calls in the middle of
[39:04] the night was a lot of fun this these
[39:06] times and I I missed those days a little
[39:09] bit and I loved it so much and I might
[39:11] get into it at some point right now
[39:14] there's no other value for me than
[39:16] Bitcoin uh that might change in 10 years
[39:19] or five years whatever like depending on
[39:21] how quickly Bitcoin now goes closer to
[39:25] its full potential uh I'm might never
[39:28] start again again but I don't think
[39:30] that's the case and and I think I always
[39:34] have uh always had a big feeling in me
[39:38] that I have to speak with other people
[39:40] and I want to share my stories and share
[39:42] my journey with with the internet with
[39:45] everyone so I think I would have gotten
[39:48] into content creation and some sort of
[39:52] sense um so uh I I did say some BS here
[39:59] definitely uh but isn't it is
[40:01] interesting how I thought about things a
[40:03] few months ago bitcoiners
[40:06] offline I orange build some
[40:10] friends uh definitely like I orange
[40:12] build my my best friends even like my my
[40:16] small cousin he's like a really bit big
[40:18] bitcoiner now uh like even my dad is now
[40:21] orange build like I orange buil some of
[40:24] my environment already most of them uh
[40:27] if if you look at the wider family are
[40:29] really skeptical uh still also in the
[40:32] company where I like not quit there's
[40:34] also like a a lot of Skeptics and there
[40:36] are some that are also orange build like
[40:39] one or two um in there but I think it
[40:44] was just to find uh some Community to
[40:48] talk to at first like I was just on
[40:50] Twitter I was uh like how my Twitter
[40:52] started is actually nice story I wanted
[40:56] to find news and I just reposted the
[40:59] news that I found nice so I can find it
[41:02] afterwards
[41:03] better and then at some point I uh then
[41:07] all of the sudden I got like 100 uh
[41:10] followers just from that for some reason
[41:12] I did not even write anything I just
[41:14] like reposted it and people saw me maybe
[41:17] I I re I replied to some and maybe like
[41:19] oh that's an interesting thought like
[41:21] let's follow Robin and then I also
[41:23] started uh writing to the news that I
[41:26] repost posted with some comments and
[41:30] then I got even more followers like it
[41:31] was like 150 200 followers then and the
[41:35] interesting part was then I was like hm
[41:37] interesting I don't do any work uh for
[41:41] getting followers but I get followers so
[41:44] I was like let's try to make it more
[41:47] regular and I started posting once a day
[41:50] twice a day three times a day and stuff
[41:52] like that and then more and more and
[41:55] then at like a th follow followers I had
[41:57] the decision to make do I want to make
[41:59] it professionally or not this was like
[42:02] beginning of uh 2023 beginning I had
[42:05] like 600 followers between thousand in
[42:09] the February something like that I don't
[42:11] remember exactly the the account and uh
[42:15] there I was like okay I want to do
[42:16] professionally I switched also from
[42:18] German to English uh so I switched from
[42:21] my local language German to my my second
[42:26] language uh English which is now kind of
[42:29] getting to my main language because my
[42:32] girlfriend is from India so she doesn't
[42:34] understand German so I speak English
[42:35] with her in the company I spoke a lot of
[42:38] spoke a lot of English now I have once a
[42:41] day at least one interview uh that I
[42:45] have on the podcast so I speak their
[42:47] English also so my English is getting my
[42:51] I'm I'm converting to an English
[42:52] Standard I guess yes this this happened
[42:55] this happened like when you start
[42:57] interacting in English so much like
[43:00] happened to me sometimes and the point
[43:03] is that you have the advantage with your
[43:05] language because you still live in
[43:07] Austria I in Hong Kong far away from my
[43:11] mother language that is the Spanish so
[43:14] sometimes I try to speak Spanish with my
[43:16] friends in Argentina and I forget I said
[43:21] how to say this word I'm losing my and
[43:23] when I went last time to to I used to
[43:26] talk a a mix between English Spanish and
[43:30] and all this [ __ ] so
[43:32] yes it's it's it's an actual problem uh
[43:36] when you talk so so much English and
[43:39] then when you're now listening from
[43:40] American you mostly speak English and
[43:43] it's your native language uh I maybe you
[43:46] cannot relate to that but people that
[43:48] are having a native language for example
[43:51] Dutch German Spanish French whatever and
[43:55] they are speaking a lot of English
[43:57] and they are consuming a lot of content
[43:59] in English like me also like everything
[44:02] I watch is English everything I do is
[44:04] English uh and after some time it just
[44:08] gets like um it's it's it's it's funny
[44:13] how it goes but it's um it's not it's
[44:16] not as uh fluent than the German anymore
[44:19] and this is it's it's a weird thing
[44:22] what's happening there but it's it's a
[44:24] real thing uh and and I forget words in
[44:27] in German when I speak with other bitco
[44:29] in German all of a sudden I'm like oh
[44:31] what how can I explain it in German I
[44:33] only explain it in English because
[44:35] especially in Bitcoin uh I talk most of
[44:38] the Bitcoin stuff with bitcoiners all
[44:39] around the world in English uh this it
[44:42] just gets uh to an interesting point
[44:44] where I talk a lot of English and I
[44:48] forget a little bit my mother language
[44:50] at some point
[44:52] there it's also interesting because when
[44:54] I explain someone in my local language
[44:57] German uh Bitcoin it's hard for me
[45:01] because everything I consume is English
[45:03] like I consume 90% of all the content in
[45:08] English well let me let me let me tell
[45:12] you like and some some like I started
[45:15] this podcast in English but as as
[45:19] different to you our my my mother
[45:21] language has 1 billion speakers so I
[45:24] start also interviewing people in this
[45:27] Spanish that is much easier for me and
[45:29] but when I start trying to switch the
[45:32] the first question like how were you or
[45:35] pill I don't know how to do it in
[45:38] Spanish because I don't know in Spanish
[45:40] orange p is p but I don't know if they
[45:43] call it like this so that was yeah yeah
[45:48] I think in the in in German we also say
[45:52] a lot of English words like there are so
[45:55] many English words in the German
[45:57] language also no and you and the the all
[46:00] the German people that I know or even
[46:02] Austria because I have friends here that
[46:04] are from Austria of course the level of
[46:07] English that you have are so much be
[46:10] better than the the ones that we come
[46:12] from from from Spanish background so I
[46:16] think it's easier yeah it also depends
[46:19] who you meet a lot of austrians that
[46:21] cannot speak good good English for
[46:24] example my my mother she she struck with
[46:27] my girlfriend because she cannot
[46:29] understand but there's like the younger
[46:31] generation in in Austria usually has a
[46:34] good English like we learn English in
[46:36] school it's really important we do a lot
[46:38] of presentations in English we're doing
[46:40] everything in the school in English uh
[46:43] and so when you live up in Austria and
[46:46] you're under 20 years old you should
[46:49] have quite good English um and for me it
[46:52] was especially easy after some time
[46:55] because I had like an and trip to Malta
[46:58] once where I was one month in Malta
[47:01] having only exposure to English this is
[47:04] where I trained a lot of English then I
[47:06] speak a lot of English also in the
[47:07] company where I've been like for six
[47:09] years now and now also with the podcast
[47:13] I think yeah so and coming back to the
[47:16] the origins so you you start uh
[47:18] switching from German to English yeah
[47:22] and then the account start
[47:24] growing yes I mean the the the language
[47:28] switch was I think the smaller part in
[47:30] the the growing part it was just like
[47:32] yes it's a wider audience but it has
[47:34] also more competitors uh there are more
[47:37] competitors I say like there's there's
[47:39] more Supply from English speaker and
[47:42] more demand from English speaker of
[47:44] course so there's a balance to it I
[47:46] think um and uh yeah growing like I I
[47:52] get asked that a lot why do I do an
[47:54] English podcast why do I do it not in
[47:57] German when I'm German there's one
[47:59] really simple answer to that I don't
[48:02] like to talk only with Germans austrians
[48:04] and swiss people those are the ones who
[48:07] understand German so I want
[48:09] to I want to talk with Indians I want to
[48:13] talk with Africans I want to talk with
[48:15] Canadians Australians Americans with
[48:17] everyone around the world uh if I want
[48:20] to do that unfortunately AI life
[48:23] synchronization is not there yet uh so I
[48:26] have to do it in English so that's
[48:29] that's that's common sense and basic uh
[48:32] human knowledge
[48:34] and in in German we actually have quite
[48:38] good speakers we have a great podcast
[48:41] with niiko Y we have great people that
[48:44] make everyday live streams like Roman
[48:46] and and sunny degree it's like it I I I
[48:50] don't need to get into Bitcoin
[48:52] podcasting in German because there are a
[48:55] lot of German great German uh podcasters
[48:58] there also a lot of great German uh
[49:00] great English podcasters and content
[49:02] creators so I can freely choose I don't
[49:05] have to fill a fill a hole in a market a
[49:08] gap in a market I just have to go
[49:10] wherever I want to be and English is my
[49:14] place English is I speak English with my
[49:17] girlfriend I speak English with all my
[49:19] guests I speak English with most of my
[49:21] friends till now I speak English more
[49:24] way more now than I speak German it's
[49:28] weird for me to speak German it's it's
[49:30] getting weird for me to speak German
[49:32] because I speak so much English and I
[49:34] understand my English is not the best
[49:36] and it will never be uh uh I I will
[49:40] probably be Never As Good in English as
[49:42] as yeah native English speakers but I
[49:45] guess I get more fluent in it and I
[49:47] guess I get a little bit more settled in
[49:50] in English uh and it will be interesting
[49:52] to see I I I'm actually really
[49:53] interested in like comparing the first
[49:55] podcast with the the last podcast that I
[49:59] do on my podcast with uh the English
[50:01] level and English skills that I have but
[50:04] I I don't think it got got that much
[50:06] better uh and uh it's it's also not that
[50:10] important as long as I'm understandable
[50:13] for the audience it seems that people
[50:16] are okay with me having a little bit
[50:18] less of English
[50:20] skills was interesting because I was
[50:23] like if I dedicate to growing an social
[50:26] media account
[50:27] I should be really active so I uh
[50:30] dedicated myself to doing eight tweets a
[50:33] day and now actually I do 12 tweets
[50:37] every day uh that I post a original
[50:40] tweets and with the replies last year I
[50:45] got over 50 tweets per day like eight
[50:48] that I put out and uh the rest like the
[50:51] 42 that are remaining are replies to
[50:54] every person like and that's really
[50:57] interesting to see um when you put out a
[51:00] lot of
[51:01] tweets uh you put out a lot of [ __ ] and
[51:04] you put out a lot of good stuff and your
[51:07] brain recognizes it like you get really
[51:09] good in writing tweets when you write so
[51:12] many tweets because you get the positive
[51:14] and negative feedback loop you're
[51:16] putting out a lot of tweets then oh this
[51:19] tweet all all um all of the sudden gets
[51:21] 100K Impressions then you read it and
[51:25] you're like ah okay this this works and
[51:27] then it's like oh this got 500
[51:29] Impressions and this actually still uh
[51:32] like I have now almost 10K followers
[51:35] some tweets get I think my most
[51:38] successful was around half a million
[51:40] impressions and I get a lot of uh lot of
[51:43] tweets like U I don't know at least once
[51:45] a month I get one tweet above 100K above
[51:49] 200k and I still have tweets that get
[51:51] only 500 Impressions which is amazing
[51:54] that that there can be tweets with 500
[51:57] Impressions and 500,000 Impressions so I
[52:00] still get that feedback loop and I still
[52:02] iterate I'm still really early in
[52:04] finding out how can I best serve the
[52:08] Bitcoin Community because this this is
[52:10] it in the end of the day because I want
[52:12] to find out how can I uh provide value
[52:16] to the Bitcoin Community because if I
[52:18] provide value they will like it they
[52:20] will repost it they will comment in it
[52:21] they will share it and then when they do
[52:23] all those stuff it gets to a bigger
[52:25] audience and then I get the value back
[52:28] because I get a bigger audience and a
[52:30] bigger recognition in the community it's
[52:32] like value for Value give give value in
[52:34] the community and the community will uh
[52:36] provide you back with with value and
[52:38] then in uh December or November actually
[52:43] uh because I was growing I had more and
[52:45] more contact with uh people in the
[52:48] Bitcoin sphere so people were saying
[52:50] like hey should we go on a zoom call hey
[52:52] do you want to do this and stuff so I
[52:55] was starting to have some Zoom calls
[52:57] with some bitcoiners and just talking
[52:59] about Bitcoin and life in general and in
[53:01] the same time I was like I go to this
[53:04] Bitcoin conferences most of them have
[53:07] seen Robin S but nobody knows me so I
[53:11] was like I will still then I have
[53:13] another decision to make do I want
[53:15] people to know my face with the name and
[53:17] Bitcoin Associated yes or no I was like
[53:20] yes I want that I want to be more
[53:21] integrated in the Bitcoin Community I
[53:23] want to do more for the Bitcoin
[53:25] community and and this was basically the
[53:28] time where I was like okay I have to
[53:29] have a video format and then I started
[53:31] the podcast I started everything and
[53:34] yeah this is uh this is basically how I
[53:37] I I put a lot of stuff out there and try
[53:40] to learn along the way this is basically
[53:42] my strategic because I get asked
[53:45] actually sometimes in my DMs oh how did
[53:47] you grow the account how did you do this
[53:49] I'm like tweet eight tweets a day for uh
[53:54] at least a year if you
[53:56] yeah it's it's like what's the secret
[53:58] source to growing an account what's the
[54:00] secret source to to be better in content
[54:02] creation or what's the secret source to
[54:04] basically be better in anything yeah you
[54:07] have to do a lot of freaking work like
[54:09] you have to step up your game and you
[54:12] have to do the repetitions you have to
[54:14] do the repetitions every day you have to
[54:16] do the repetitions uh with a lot of
[54:19] actions I did a lot of tweets I do now a
[54:22] lot of podcasts and I will get really
[54:23] good in it uh and uh the same when you
[54:26] want to have muscles you have to go
[54:28] every day in the gym you have to do all
[54:29] the things uh good and you will get
[54:31] better with time you will learn with
[54:33] time and no matter what you want to do
[54:35] you will get better with repetition and
[54:38] the secret Source the secret source to
[54:40] success in any way shape or form do a
[54:42] lot of action and you will get there
[54:44] it's not the only thing that you have to
[54:46] consider but um with the with the a lot
[54:50] of action with a lot of repetition you
[54:52] get the insights and the connections to
[54:54] actually level up and and get where you
[54:56] actually want to
[54:59] be uh then uh leave
[55:03] it yes because this is then just
[55:06] something you you it's it's not it's not
[55:08] yours but uh it's it's almost impossible
[55:11] to not succeed if you put out eight
[55:13] original tweets where you think about it
[55:15] and you try really hard to do it good
[55:17] for over a year because you will get
[55:19] better like your first they will be bad
[55:22] but then you get better it's part of the
[55:24] proof of work it's part of the proof of
[55:26] work that everything in life does so
[55:30] everything as as I spoke with you in
[55:32] your podcast that you made the great
[55:34] short uh if if everything you you do in
[55:38] your life you do it following the
[55:41] Bitcoin standard no matter what it is no
[55:43] matter if it's Bitcoin no matter what it
[55:45] is it's GNA be successful that's the
[55:48] that's the main point but you need to do
[55:50] the proof of work as you do yeah I think
[55:53] it's really important that whatever you
[55:55] are doing you should do it in a way that
[55:58] you're proud of it like never put
[56:00] something out you're like ah I don't
[56:02] know if this it's good like maybe in
[56:04] Twitter you can test a little bit like
[56:05] you can try with shitty tweets also like
[56:09] see that's how how how people react
[56:11] because Twitter forgets a lot like even
[56:13] if you put out bad things the the
[56:16] community forgets uh fast I think uh but
[56:20] like just just try to to uh make
[56:23] something that you can be proud of and
[56:26] this
[56:27] I'm talking I'm talking about that that
[56:29] that now is your main activity what is
[56:31] your objective of on this field of
[56:34] content creation educational content
[56:37] about
[56:38] Bitcoin I mean I have in my Twitter bio
[56:41] is I think the one sentence I will not
[56:44] shut up about Bitcoin till it's the Bas
[56:46] lay of our financial
[56:48] system um that's the main goal that
[56:51] that's the main goal there's always like
[56:54] uh I think there's always to every
[56:56] uh there's incentives and there's uh a
[57:00] greater goal for incentives for the
[57:01] society there's greater goals for
[57:03] incentive for yourself and of course for
[57:06] myself this would be uh um increasing as
[57:11] clud would say my personal freedom
[57:13] footprint because then I'm not touched
[57:16] to a location I can do this wherever I
[57:18] want uh I can be a little bit more free
[57:21] with what I uh what I do because when I
[57:25] can 100%
[57:26] control uh in the day what I do that's
[57:30] free myself and this will I think I hope
[57:33] also unlock a lot of creativity and a
[57:35] lot of uh better content and will even
[57:39] increase more uh of of the um traction
[57:42] that my channels do um this is just the
[57:45] personal goals but the the societal
[57:48] thing the the the thing why I do it with
[57:51] Bitcoin because I could also talk about
[57:54] stocks I could also talk about sports I
[57:55] could also talk about so many other
[57:58] topics I could also talk now about how
[58:01] to grow in Twitter Chanel like I I could
[58:04] talk about so many uh things in my
[58:07] channels uh but I specifically want to
[58:10] talk about Bitcoin because for me this
[58:12] is the most important thing you can
[58:15] spend your time in we are now in the
[58:17] phase where we are uh like in the early
[58:20] internet before the 2000 uh 2000.com
[58:25] bubble we before that event where
[58:29] everything is so new and you just have
[58:31] to be involved and just have to be
[58:33] educated in that uh Bitcoin sphere uh to
[58:37] know what's going on because the iPhone
[58:40] is still 10 years away to develop the
[58:42] the Facebook is still few years away
[58:45] from being developed and started like
[58:47] YouTube is not existing right now and
[58:50] all those applications all those layers
[58:52] all those payment things that we will
[58:56] develop they are not even born now there
[58:58] will be killer applications on top of
[59:01] Bitcoin there will payment service on
[59:03] top of Bitcoin that will be so great for
[59:05] Humanity that where where the founder is
[59:09] not even working on it right now yes
[59:12] company is still still on like so so we
[59:14] are so early and it's so interesting the
[59:17] whole sphere and if I can do for the
[59:21] community just interview like 200 300
[59:24] people every year I do like five maybe
[59:27] when I canot do it fulltime maybe I can
[59:29] even do it like every day an interview
[59:31] and publish it every day this would be
[59:33] actually my goal then I can document
[59:35] everything what's going on I can invite
[59:38] the most interesting persons uh and all
[59:41] the PLS that are involved in the Bitcoin
[59:44] community and and build like a really
[59:46] really cool um um collection of mins
[59:50] what we think right now of Bitcoin and
[59:53] like just looking back like how cool
[59:55] would it be to have an podcast about
[59:59] internet from
[60:01] 1995 where someone just interviewed
[60:04] everyone involved in the space and this
[60:06] is what I wanted to create and this is
[60:09] amazing what you say because like uh
[60:12] it's it's so important for me to jump in
[60:13] here because um I want to create
[60:16] something that's even bigger uh or
[60:20] that's even Beyond Bitcoin I want to
[60:23] have educational entertainment cont
[60:26] educational content entertainment
[60:27] content I want to have historical
[60:30] content with Bitcoin I want to have a
[60:33] lot of great content so you can level up
[60:37] in the Bitcoin uh uh in the Bitcoin
[60:39] sphere you can learn more about Bitcoin
[60:42] but you can also learn more about life
[60:44] and in general uh maybe business maybe
[60:46] marketing maybe other things so like uh
[60:49] my main thing will probably be Bitcoin
[60:52] for very long time uh but as you've
[60:55] noticed
[60:56] I've gone into other topics every once
[60:59] in a while uh on my podcast and uh when
[61:04] you have one hour two hour conversation
[61:05] with someone you go in other topics also
[61:08] and they are connected to bitcoin always
[61:11] uh but you learn a lot about life and
[61:14] and work and and in philosophy and
[61:16] meditation and all that that that that
[61:18] stuff you learn a lot from it so uh this
[61:21] is what I'm really passionate about and
[61:23] I'm also working with other creers that
[61:27] uh that that are uh creating stuff on
[61:30] new formats that I might bring on my
[61:33] Channel or bring a new channel so uh
[61:35] stay tuned there are a lot of things are
[61:37] coming uh and I have a lot of things
[61:39] planned for uh this this
[61:43] channel what I say what if we could have
[61:46] a podcast about internet for sure there
[61:48] might be videos there might be but now
[61:50] we are documenting Bitcoin everything
[61:53] doing and and I agree with you
[61:56] um I have a lot of things to talk about
[61:58] too I I can talk a lot about sports of
[62:02] Entrepreneurship Market a lot of things
[62:04] but I think that the most important
[62:06] thing that I can dedicate my time to to
[62:08] share a message is about Bitcoin because
[62:11] it's going to disrupt the humanity As We
[62:13] Know It And um also as you said there
[62:17] are things that are going to be created
[62:20] that the seos are not creating yet yes
[62:24] also we are document end in all this
[62:27] Revolution and in the future when the
[62:29] people look back they are going to have
[62:31] these conversations of the early Bitcoin
[62:35] State because even though many people
[62:37] think that now with Bitcoin at 5 50k 55
[62:41] whatever it's it's late no no we are
[62:44] super early we are super early and and
[62:47] it's going to grow even more yeah just
[62:51] ask yourself the question uh how many
[62:53] people have Bitcoin right now and it's
[62:55] it's like a small percentage and then um
[62:59] go even uh one step uh further how many
[63:04] bitcoiners actually understand what
[63:06] Bitcoin is can actually answer the
[63:09] question I have a few friends that also
[63:11] are full in
[63:13] Bitcoin I am for sure if I ask them 20
[63:17] questions at question number eight they
[63:20] don't know the answer of course me me of
[63:23] course I I I can I I know like I'm 100%
[63:27] Bitcoin I consume a lot of content in of
[63:29] Bitcoin but if you start asking me
[63:31] question I've been in the honey badger
[63:34] in Ria last year and some speeches for
[63:39] me they were talking about I don't know
[63:41] some things that I don't even understand
[63:43] so yeah of course so we so early what
[63:48] the education is also like even
[63:51] um there there's also some interesting
[63:53] statistic that would be really
[63:55] interesting to see
[63:56] for example uh the hardware uh wallet uh
[64:00] um um developers the companies of the
[64:03] hardware wallets I would be really
[64:05] interesting uh to see how many have a
[64:08] ledger how many have a bitbox how many
[64:10] have like how many Hardware wallets are
[64:12] out there and it would be such an
[64:15] interesting number to see the adoption
[64:17] because if you have Bitcoin on
[64:19] Exchange I would say you didn't
[64:22] understand
[64:23] Bitcoin so how many people do you think
[64:27] are actually right now having Bitcoin in
[64:30] self custody do you have like a number
[64:31] in mind I I know there's like maybe 100
[64:35] million to 300 million people that have
[64:38] Bitcoin or a significant amount of
[64:40] Bitcoin because of addresses but how
[64:42] many actually have it in self custody H
[64:45] 50% of these people
[64:48] maybe we are super super duper early and
[64:52] as this format uh is a new for format
[64:56] and a format that has I've never done
[64:59] before I'm halfway through the video uh
[65:02] and I want to make a stop here because I
[65:04] want to see what is the reaction of you
[65:07] guys how long do you want to watch this
[65:10] uh how many are actually interested in
[65:12] in those kind of videos so leave me a
[65:14] comment down below if you are interested
[65:16] in me reacting to other podcasts maybe
[65:21] even other videos that I've not been in
[65:24] like I just now start with because I was
[65:26] thought like it's interesting because
[65:28] it's a long longer time ago uh and I can
