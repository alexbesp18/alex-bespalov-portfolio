[00:00] I got Bitcoin at the price I deserved
[00:02] there's like an element of sticking it
[00:03] to the system that this is mine you
[00:05] can't touch it this current government
[00:07] is not giving anyone any hope it's just
[00:10] bad news after bad news after bad news
[00:12] there's no hope the amount of
[00:14] misinformation that exists on mainstream
[00:16] media about Bitcoin is daggering whether
[00:19] it's 200% or 30% or 500% either way it's
[00:23] a hedge against the Ridiculousness of
[00:26] the system that we're in Freedom is a
[00:29] fundamental value for me freedom to live
[00:32] where you want freedom of speech freedom
[00:34] of expression freedom to manage my own
[00:36] money and not be told by a government
[00:39] that oh no no you're just a little silly
[00:41] little human you you shouldn't be
[00:43] allowed to put your money into things
[00:45] like this because you don't even
[00:47] understand you can't blame anyone else
[00:48] for the things that might go wrong when
[00:50] you're a Bitcoin holder you have to just
[00:52] make sure you're paying attention to
[00:53] what's going
[00:54] [Music]
[00:58] on you have been just recently in
[01:01] Bitcoin I heard like you you've been are
[01:03] you class
[01:05] 2024 yeah I'm so new I think it's great
[01:09] I think it's a I don't know if I ever
[01:12] had a guest on that was the first time
[01:15] in the Bitcoin with 2024 I think that's
[01:18] a Premiere I I'm I'm not 100% sure but I
[01:22] think it's it's something new and I
[01:23] think it's really interesting because we
[01:25] get uh a perspective of a fresh mind a
[01:29] lot of the Bitcoin have been here for
[01:31] like two years four years or maybe even
[01:33] like eight or 10 years they have so much
[01:37] experience but at the same time
[01:41] baggage they they carry with them and so
[01:45] many uh Notions and so many judgments
[01:48] and I know it for myself um so uh maybe
[01:53] give us your overall Bitcoin take how
[01:55] you got into Bitcoin in
[01:58] 2024 uh and and how do you look at the
[02:00] Bitcoin Community even though I know
[02:02] you're just like coming in a little bit
[02:05] and and you're just like probably
[02:06] touching the surface of like what the
[02:08] Bitcoin Community is all about but tell
[02:10] us uh tell us um okay so I heard about
[02:14] Bitcoin a long time ago right I think
[02:16] the very first time I heard about it was
[02:18] maybe 2014 or
[02:21] 2016 and I kind of ignored it and then I
[02:25] heard about it again a couple of years
[02:27] later ignored it again in 201 20 two of
[02:30] my very good friends they both bought a
[02:35] Bitcoin each and I knew they had done it
[02:38] but I was so kind of busy with my own
[02:41] life and running my business I didn't
[02:43] have time to think about it so I ignored
[02:46] it again um and then finally what
[02:50] happened this year is that I met up with
[02:53] one of those friends and it was just me
[02:55] and her normally there's always loads of
[02:58] other people around it's very very rare
[03:00] that it's just me and her and we started
[03:02] talking about this stuff
[03:04] initially um she so she's got her
[03:07] Bitcoin but every now and then on the
[03:09] side she likes to play around with some
[03:11] of the
[03:13] shitcoins and so we were talking about
[03:15] that and so actually the very first
[03:18] thing I did was do a shitcoin
[03:24] pre-sale and because I was following
[03:28] what was going on with that coin on
[03:30] Twitter Twitter started showing me loads
[03:32] of Bitcoin stuff and I started really
[03:35] paying attention to that CU instead of
[03:38] it just being loads of crazy memes and
[03:40] things on on my feed there's people
[03:43] actually talking about what Bitcoin is
[03:45] and so it was in April of this year that
[03:49] I finally paid some attention and I got
[03:52] Bitcoin at the price I
[03:54] deserved um and and since then it's just
[03:58] been nonstop I feel like I've I'm still
[04:00] very much in the rabbit hole there's so
[04:02] much to learn it's so amazing the people
[04:06] the community in the
[04:08] UK is a pretty small community
[04:11] especially in London that's where I am
[04:13] and I've been meeting people in real
[04:15] life bumping into people at different
[04:17] events and it's actually really really
[04:20] cool but the most amazing feeling about
[04:24] it all for me not just meeting all the
[04:28] people but you know the thing that
[04:29] really gets me is self- custody it is
[04:32] the scariest most exhilarating thing
[04:36] that you can do in terms of really
[04:38] taking control of life and um my
[04:43] experience with going self- custody was
[04:46] really what um hammered all of this home
[04:50] for me that yeah Bitcoin is amazing and
[04:53] this is just another reason
[04:55] why why why is the self custody part for
[04:58] for you so important
[05:01] um there's so many things there's like
[05:03] an element of sticking it to the system
[05:06] that this is mine you can't touch
[05:08] it uh the just that level of
[05:11] responsibility and accountability in in
[05:14] countries that like to really treat us
[05:17] like children and Nanny us and say in
[05:19] the UK you know the way they treat
[05:21] Bitcoin we don't even have access to
[05:24] ETFs because they think we need to be
[05:27] protected from Bitcoin
[05:30] um everything
[05:32] about how empowering it is as well I
[05:36] love
[05:37] it do do you think that the the UK is uh
[05:42] in in the great decline as we say
[05:46] yeah yeah it's not a popular take um we
[05:50] have a government that's just come into
[05:52] power after a very long time of them
[05:55] being in the opposition and you know
[05:58] when usually that sort of thing happens
[06:00] in a country and it's happened here
[06:01] before as well where the other party
[06:05] comes in after a very long time and they
[06:07] come on a message of Hope usually they
[06:10] come with a message of positivity even
[06:13] if difficult things are going to have to
[06:14] happen they have a message of hope this
[06:18] current government has is not giving
[06:20] anyone any hope it's just bad news after
[06:23] bad news after bad news whether it's
[06:27] realistic or not doesn't even matter at
[06:29] this point point the actions they're
[06:30] taking there's nothing we can do we're
[06:32] stuck with them for 5 years but there's
[06:35] no hope they're not building they're not
[06:37] painting a picture of a great
[06:40] country or a country that might become
[06:43] amazing again no it's just problem after
[06:46] problem and and they don't care that
[06:48] people are unhappy already after just
[06:51] four or five months of them being in
[06:54] charge H it's it's unfortunately the the
[06:57] overall feeling I get from lot of
[06:59] European countries uh and the overall
[07:02] feeling that that I get also from
[07:04] Germany right now I mean there are now
[07:05] new selections uh in Austria a lot of
[07:08] things also in in in in progress because
[07:11] there are new elections so in and and in
[07:14] the elections you really see that people
[07:17] don't like the government because
[07:19] everywhere on every level there are
[07:22] different parties in in control and
[07:24] wherever the par is in control those
[07:27] parties lose the most so so like the
[07:29] people are really like just like we we
[07:31] don't want that we really unsatisfied
[07:34] with where things going and I think
[07:35] that's just like um uh Trend we see all
[07:39] over the place we saw it in America uh
[07:41] Biden Harris was in control and they
[07:45] really I think it was the first time
[07:47] since a long time that that the
[07:49] president got the presidential um case
[07:52] and the popular vote uh so both of them
[07:56] in the last eight years it was always
[07:58] either one of them uh so there's a lot
[08:00] of things uh changing and one thing that
[08:03] I also want to note from what you said
[08:05] earlier which is really interesting I
[08:08] think if you sit down with someone in
[08:11] calm um uh and you know what Bitcoin is
[08:15] and the other person doesn't know what
[08:17] Bitcoin is there's no way the other
[08:19] person will not invest at least a little
[08:21] bit into Bitcoin if you have the chance
[08:23] to sit down with him in calmness in in
[08:25] the long evening uh because it just
[08:28] makes sense at some point you run out of
[08:30] bad arguments against Bitcoin and so if
[08:33] the evening is long enough and uh
[08:36] nobody's fighting it will be uh there's
[08:40] no way he can he or she can come out
[08:42] without investing in Bitcoin at least
[08:44] that's how I see it absolutely and
[08:47] that's kind of why I was so grateful to
[08:49] be given a sponsored spot in the Bitcoin
[08:52] Educators Academy um Rachel guia who is
[08:57] from leams orang in Germany she actually
[09:00] managed to get me a sponsored spot and
[09:03] that and being on that course was
[09:06] so fascinating because they taught us
[09:10] amongst loads of other things they
[09:12] taught us how we can get better at
[09:15] talking about Bitcoin drawing analogies
[09:18] um you know challenging some of the
[09:21] myths that exist out there like boiling
[09:23] oceans and all that stupid stuff the
[09:26] amount of misinformation that exists on
[09:28] mainstream media about Bitcoin is just
[09:32] staggering and and so being able to talk
[09:36] to people or you know I'm slowly getting
[09:39] better at talking to people about it if
[09:41] I get the opportunity I do it I I orange
[09:43] pilled one of my clients a couple of
[09:46] weeks ago she's downloaded the Bitcoin
[09:48] standard and resistance money both those
[09:51] books I think are amazing um I'm I'm
[09:55] often conversing with one of the authors
[09:57] of resistance money on X so that's
[10:00] really nice
[10:02] and and she said to me that she has
[10:05] downloaded strike so I'm just hoping
[10:08] she's put some money in now I said even
[10:09] if you can just put in £100 put in100
[10:12] and leave it and see what happens and if
[10:14] it gets you curious put a little bit
[10:16] more in and that I think is a really
[10:18] great way of getting people interested
[10:21] in what Bitcoin is actually about
[10:23] absolutely um I think we talked about
[10:26] before we started recording um what is
[10:28] the educ ational Academy just for
[10:30] listeners that don't don't know about it
[10:32] and what are you doing there sure so
[10:35] Duan Medusa is the guy that runs the
[10:37] Bitcoin Educators Academy it's an
[10:40] organization that is basically just
[10:42] trying to help as many of us bitcoiners
[10:46] get better at Orange peing other people
[10:50] and um he also is the owner of a mining
[10:53] company called Amity age and Amity age
[10:56] is like his business that he runs to
[10:58] support the Bitcoin Educators Academy
[11:00] and it's just a fantastic uh fantastic
[11:03] course I I was on it for four whole days
[11:07] in Germany at the beginning of November
[11:10] I think it was and it was a it was a
[11:13] fantastic experience the other people
[11:14] that I was on the course with you know
[11:16] I've become friends with them everything
[11:18] about it was just very positive and full
[11:22] of hopeful energy uh and I think that's
[11:25] another reason why the whole proposition
[11:28] everything about Bitcoin is attractive
[11:30] because the people who are in the
[11:32] Bitcoin space they have that positive
[11:34] energy when actually people
[11:36] otherwise don't have as much of that and
[11:39] I was one of those people yeah really
[11:42] recently with 204 I that um and you also
[11:46] gave you told me gave a talk uh at an
[11:48] event at UK what was that about oh yeah
[11:52] um so the reason why you and me are even
[11:55] speaking today is because I gave a talk
[11:58] at the women of Bitcoin UK's first event
[12:03] and that was at the beginning of October
[12:05] um I only spoke for like 10 minutes uh
[12:08] and I spoke about self- custody I spoke
[12:11] about why I think self- custody is so
[12:13] important where even if you are
[12:17] intimidated by the idea of it you should
[12:20] still do it you should still try it uh
[12:23] especially if you trust yourself enough
[12:25] with the
[12:26] process um and talking about the risks
[12:30] that exist out there if you don't do it
[12:32] like if you leave your coins on an
[12:33] exchange well those coins can be taken
[12:36] away you can lose them you know like if
[12:38] the exchange goes down or if it's hacked
[12:40] but also if a government becomes hostile
[12:43] and they want to close the off ramps you
[12:46] can say goodbye to your coins um if you
[12:49] know if you're not sure whether your
[12:51] whether your exchange is even holding
[12:53] all the coins it says it's holding maybe
[12:56] the one time you decide you want to take
[12:58] them off for whatever reason you're not
[12:59] able to get them so there's all sorts of
[13:02] reasons why I was saying self- custody
[13:04] is the most important thing to me uh
[13:08] certainly was at that point and it's
[13:10] because I gave that talk that Rachel
[13:12] connected me to you that I got the spot
[13:15] on the Bitcoin Educators Academy and I
[13:18] also ended up being invited by the two
[13:21] women running women of Bitcoin UK to
[13:23] join them and help run it and grow it
[13:26] because it's a brand new
[13:27] organization and we are putting together
[13:30] a plan for 2025 so that's me Christina
[13:33] Lamas and CLA Prince we're running it
[13:37] and we're going to see where we can take
[13:39] it next year H that's great uh I love
[13:42] that and uh I feel like the the Bitcoin
[13:45] Community is just a bunch of opening
[13:47] doors it's like you you go in there and
[13:50] if you really want to do something
[13:52] there's thousands of opportunities
[13:54] there's like so many people that will
[13:57] help you out uh and they get you started
[14:00] it's really welcoming um Community what
[14:04] what are you doing outside of Bitcoin or
[14:07] what did you do before Bitcoin and and
[14:08] maybe how how does this compare how do
[14:10] you see Bitcoin in opposite to that sure
[14:14] well I I run my own business and I do a
[14:16] lot of work working directly with um HR
[14:21] departments uh boards at organizations
[14:25] helping them figure out how to build
[14:26] better company cultures some sometimes
[14:29] it's really positive proactive stuff
[14:31] sometimes it's helping them with real
[14:33] issues that they've had so it might be
[14:35] stuff like well you know messy things
[14:38] like sexual harassment or or whatever uh
[14:42] so that's that's still my day job it's a
[14:45] business that I've built over the last
[14:47] 10 years I'm really proud of what I've
[14:49] achieved but before that I spent about
[14:52] 15 years working in financial services
[14:55] doing something completely different I
[14:57] used to be um I used to be an acty and
[15:01] my whole job was looking at
[15:03] risk so that's kind of what wasn't act
[15:08] I'm I'm not native into English so maybe
[15:11] I don't know you know what I'll try and
[15:13] describe it although I haven't done it
[15:14] for such a long time now I might get it
[15:16] wrong um an act is someone that looks at
[15:20] the risk and an organization of
[15:22] financial services organization is
[15:24] exposed to so let's say for example an
[15:25] insurance company they sell insurance
[15:28] polic icies they collect the premiums
[15:31] they pay out claims the act's job is to
[15:34] do statistical analysis and look at okay
[15:36] these are the premiums we've got coming
[15:38] in we better make sure we're charging
[15:40] enough premiums based on the kind of
[15:42] claims we expect to see on a product
[15:45] like this and it could be you know
[15:47] really kind of everyday products like
[15:49] insuring houses or sometimes it's more
[15:51] exciting stuff like insuring satellite
[15:53] launches or rocket launches that kind of
[15:55] thing uh so it's assessing all the
[15:59] statistical risks around money that you
[16:02] might have to pay out later and it was a
[16:04] very good career it's just that I
[16:06] couldn't see myself doing that for the
[16:08] rest of my life I just thought there's
[16:11] no way I want to do this for the rest of
[16:13] my life I did it for 15 years that was
[16:16] enough yeah it seems
[16:19] like a lot of exle sheets and a lot of
[16:21] statistics and a lot of like crunching
[16:23] numbers where it a 10 hours before a
[16:26] screen and look at different numbers
[16:30] I was one of the lucky ones where I had
[16:33] to do spreadsheets but I also got to
[16:36] travel around our European offices quite
[16:38] a bit and go around talking to people
[16:40] building relationships so I was
[16:43] definitely uh very fortunate in the role
[16:45] that I had but even then I didn't want
[16:47] to do it until I'm like 60 that was not
[16:50] something I wanted to
[16:53] do um from that background um how how do
[16:57] you assess the risks of bit coin like
[16:59] how how do you how do you look at at
[17:01] Bitcoin as the as class 10 um that's a
[17:04] really good question so when I first
[17:06] started buying in April so recently I
[17:10] just thought I'm going to give it a go
[17:12] I'm going to buy some right now whilst I
[17:14] keep learning about it and you know
[17:16] you're looking at Old graphs you're
[17:18] looking at the volatility of it and it
[17:20] does feel a little bit scary when you're
[17:22] brand new into Bitcoin especially if you
[17:24] really start pumping your savings into
[17:26] it like I have been
[17:29] um but then you look at the bigger
[17:31] picture and you look at the risk of the
[17:33] actual economy as it is right now and
[17:36] that is a way bigger risk that I can see
[17:40] the way that it feels to me is the way
[17:42] our economies are being run individual
[17:45] countries but then all the
[17:47] interconnectedness between the countries
[17:49] the way that they're being run that
[17:51] feels like the riskiest thing ever far
[17:54] more risky than anything Bitcoin um has
[17:58] the potential to to do self- custody is
[18:01] risky you don't want to get that wrong
[18:03] because if you lose your coins they're
[18:04] gone there's no helpl line right there's
[18:07] no Lifeline if you lose it you're gone
[18:09] so yeah that side of it is risky but
[18:12] again that risk I'm willing to take yeah
[18:15] it it feels like the only real risk in
[18:17] Bitcoin is that you might lose it like
[18:21] you you may make a user error you make
[18:23] something with that and you can ensure
[18:26] yourself against that with proper
[18:27] education um but other than that I think
[18:30] a lot of people also when they come into
[18:31] Bitcoin they confuse volatility with
[18:34] risk and I think the traditional
[18:36] Financial space for what reason for
[18:40] whatever reason they choose to put risk
[18:43] and volatility kind of at the same
[18:45] bucket and they saying like yeah if it's
[18:47] very volatile it's obviously very risky
[18:49] which which which is just not true uh
[18:53] but yeah uh I feel volatility versus
[18:56] risk is is is an interesting uh to paid
[18:59] because whenever I talk with someone
[19:01] that isn't in Bitcoin and they bring up
[19:03] oh but it's a very speculative asset and
[19:05] I usually asking oh why it's like yeah
[19:08] because it's very risky like okay why is
[19:10] it risky and then in nine out of 10
[19:13] cases they all say like Yeah because it
[19:15] goes up and down in price a lot in
[19:16] volatility and I'm like that's not risk
[19:19] that that's volatility that's like price
[19:22] Discovery that's just like the open free
[19:23] market that tries to figure out what the
[19:26] actual price of that thing is that
[19:28] that's super normal uh but that has no
[19:31] fundamental risk like fundamental risk
[19:32] is I don't know what if the company CEO
[19:36] goes down but yeah in Bitcoin there's no
[19:38] Company CEO like there's no not that
[19:40] risk so uh it's really interesting how
[19:43] how did you come with that in there what
[19:45] what the thoughts well one of the things
[19:47] that I was looking at was how much
[19:50] Bitcoin has gone up by on average every
[19:54] year since it came into existence right
[19:57] and I think it averages out at something
[19:59] like 200% a
[20:02] year now I don't expect those sorts of
[20:05] increases to carry on I mean they might
[20:07] and that would be amazing but I want to
[20:09] be conservative about it okay so let's
[20:12] say we don't get 200% a year increases
[20:15] whatever the volatility might be who
[20:17] cares but let's just say we get 40%
[20:20] increases per
[20:22] year that is an amazing level of price
[20:27] increase for anyone who wants to protect
[20:30] the cash that they might have sitting
[20:32] around for anyone is who's sitting there
[20:34] wondering what do I do with the little
[20:37] money I might have you know even if it's
[20:40] just a small amount if you don't need it
[20:43] right now if you don't need it you don't
[20:44] know what you're going to do with it
[20:46] it's just there it's your cushion I
[20:49] think it's a really sensible play to put
[20:53] it into
[20:54] Bitcoin uh I don't even know who this
[20:59] version of me is because there's no way
[21:02] you and me would have been having this
[21:03] conversation in March of this year it's
[21:05] such a huge change but it's one of the
[21:08] most fascinating things that I've ever
[21:11] gone through and I'm just loving every
[21:14] minute of it so you know whether it's
[21:16] 200% or 30% or 500% either way it's a
[21:21] hedge against the Ridiculousness of the
[21:25] system that we're
[21:26] in H I'm getting more more of the
[21:29] opinion that this this law of
[21:31] diminishing returns is not true but but
[21:34] let's see I don't know maybe it is true
[21:37] because uh for when you look at
[21:40] exponential growth curves uh I think we
[21:43] have the biggest jump still to make uh
[21:46] and also when you look at Esq adoption
[21:49] of of Technologies we have the biggest
[21:51] jump still to make I don't know maybe we
[21:54] have a huge jump and and and and it will
[21:58] blow our faces off but uh I I I'm
[22:02] anyways 100% Bitcoin so how do I care
[22:05] yeah
[22:07] exactly well even even if the actual
[22:11] jump melts our faces off and I hope it
[22:14] does I really hope it melts my face off
[22:18] what a time to be alive um but you know
[22:23] I like to just kind of keep myself
[22:25] humble and grounded and I just say to
[22:27] myself just 30% will be fine 30% is fine
[22:31] I've already done 30% I've started
[22:33] buying in April I'm at 33% that's fine
[22:36] cool you know that's cool let's see what
[22:39] happens next year now 2024 is nearly
[22:41] over if we don't hit 100K it's not the
[22:44] end of the world of course I want it to
[22:46] hit 100K I want it to go higher but if
[22:48] it doesn't happen I can be patient about
[22:51] it I've only been doing this for six
[22:53] months that's nothing how much are you
[22:55] looking at the price like uh I I
[22:58] remember when I came into Bitcoin I
[22:59] looked like five times per
[23:02] day yeah at the moment I'm still at five
[23:05] times per day but that is because I have
[23:08] got one last little chunk of money left
[23:11] to one side and I'm just seeing if there
[23:15] is a dip so I can buy it I know I
[23:17] shouldn't be trying to time the market I
[23:19] don't care though I've got one little
[23:21] extra bit of money everything else that
[23:23] I want to put in I've put in but before
[23:26] this one last chunk I keep checking it
[23:28] all the time I'm like what's it doing
[23:30] what's it h what's happening now and if
[23:32] it has if we see a little drop the kind
[23:35] of drop that so many people will be
[23:37] upset about all the people that say oh
[23:39] see bitcoin's rubbish bitcoin's dead
[23:41] that kind of drop if we see that kind of
[23:43] drop I'm not going to be sad about it I
[23:45] want it to happen I want to get a few
[23:47] more I want to get a few more sets
[23:49] because I don't know if I'll ever be a
[23:51] whole Bitcoin or
[23:53] otherwise it's it's really interesting
[23:56] because that was that is is really quick
[23:59] like you coming in uh 6 months and uh
[24:02] already being close to this like all in
[24:05] um I remember I needed over a year to to
[24:08] to get there obviously we get so much
[24:10] better in educating the the resources
[24:12] get better with every year uh I think
[24:15] the onboarding processes uh just get way
[24:18] better uh but that's that's still quick
[24:20] like uh kudos to you like that's really
[24:23] really cool that that that you have been
[24:25] finding your way into Bitcoin that quick
[24:28] and also educating yourself so much that
[24:30] you can actually talk about that because
[24:33] I think most bitcoiners like bitcoiners
[24:36] who buy Bitcoin in the first year they
[24:39] don't know
[24:40] anything most buy it and don't even pay
[24:44] attention when they buy it and then
[24:46] after a few months they then they listen
[24:49] to their first podcast maybe then they
[24:50] like maybe pick up a book like after two
[24:53] like after like a few months so that has
[24:56] been an impressive Pace that you have
[24:58] come into Bitcoin and already gave talks
[25:00] and already in podcast already uh know
[25:03] so much about it so yeah it's it's
[25:05] definitely a compliment to you thank you
[25:07] I mean if if it's meant to be it's meant
[25:10] to be I guess it's just really it's just
[25:12] so interesting and I also think it's
[25:15] come at a time for me where I actually
[25:19] have time to think about other stuff now
[25:21] because for 10 years nine years let's
[25:24] say I've just been so focused on my work
[25:27] I've had to be right right building a
[25:29] business from zero to where I am now and
[25:33] actually feeling comfortable that oh I
[25:36] can just focus on other things now I
[25:38] can't I've got the time and this is
[25:41] something that's actually interesting to
[25:43] me because I see this amazing potential
[25:47] in it that I just I've put the time into
[25:51] it I just feel like it's worth worthy of
[25:54] my time so many other things just
[25:56] haven't felt that Worthy
[25:58] absolutely really really cool um there
[26:01] is also I think uh
[26:04] your I think you in on a position that a
[26:06] lot of people are in that maybe are
[26:08] already in Bitcoin and maybe looking at
[26:10] getting more Bitcoin or people that are
[26:12] kind of on the silence still like I
[26:13] think retail are still a little bit
[26:16] sleeping on on on bitcoin and there's
[26:19] just so much such a big buy wall if we
[26:23] uh get down to like 990,000 again or
[26:26] like 880,000 you can you can even see in
[26:28] the price we went up to almost 100K then
[26:31] we went down to 90k and we were really
[26:33] quickly again to 95 so even like a dip
[26:37] from 100K to 90k a lot of people buying
[26:40] it up uh so there are people waiting to
[26:43] to buy all the last pieces of Bitcoin up
[26:46] and that's why I'm
[26:48] like I don't know how how has it been
[26:51] for you Orange Building trying to Orange
[26:53] build like family members and other
[26:55] friends because I have a little bit of
[26:58] fear of missing out for a family even
[27:01] where I'm like okay I'm already all in
[27:03] but what what what does it what it does
[27:06] it give me if I'm all in and all my
[27:09] friends and family is suffering
[27:10] financially because they have been in a
[27:13] huge financial crisis and Bitcoin has
[27:15] searched to two million now now uh
[27:18] you're the only one that is doing
[27:20] financially good you want to get your
[27:23] your loved ones on on the on the savings
[27:25] boat on the on the yeah is it life boat
[27:28] uh and and put it on there so how do you
[27:30] look at uh orange peing
[27:32] people so I've been talking to my family
[27:35] quite a lot about it like my brother and
[27:38] my parents um my parents were much were
[27:42] a lot more open to hearing about it than
[27:46] I initially thought they might be but I
[27:48] think my dad still isn't convinced you
[27:51] know he's from a much much older
[27:53] generation where you want to be able to
[27:56] touch the things that you'll put in
[27:58] money
[27:59] into which makes sense but also doesn't
[28:02] make sense because you can't touch your
[28:03] shares what does that mean
[28:07] um my brother and I have been talking
[28:09] about it quite a lot and recently he
[28:12] said to me so how much money do you
[28:15] think I should put in like I'll do it
[28:18] okay what do you think how much money do
[28:20] you think I should put in I said well
[28:21] how much money have you got to put in
[28:23] and how much of that money do you need
[28:25] soon and he said well I've got x amount
[28:28] but I'm going to need it quite soon well
[28:30] how soon I don't know anywhere between 3
[28:33] to 6 months I'm like mate don't do
[28:37] it don't do it because I don't want to
[28:40] take on the responsibility of some sort
[28:42] of crazy thing happening and also it's
[28:44] not even about me taking on the
[28:45] responsibility if you know you're going
[28:46] to need it don't put it in there right
[28:48] now you know even I haven't put in
[28:51] absolutely everything I've kept a little
[28:52] bit to the one side because life happens
[28:55] you might need to take you might need
[28:56] money straight away to do something pay
[29:00] pay an unexpected Bill and
[29:04] so people in my life are kind of opening
[29:07] up to it a bit more they know they
[29:10] they're seeing everything that I'm doing
[29:12] and they're like oh wow how is all of
[29:14] this happening so quickly so you really
[29:16] believe in this so they're listening to
[29:17] me a little bit more but on the other
[29:20] side I've got a friend in the States you
[29:24] know we're we're really good friends
[29:25] we've known each other for about I don't
[29:27] know 13 years and we talk a couple of
[29:31] times a year cuz our lives are so busy
[29:33] and I was telling her over the summer
[29:35] when I was still getting into this stuff
[29:36] you know I hadn't even done the talk yet
[29:38] the talk we spoke about just I was just
[29:40] saying these are the things that I'm
[29:42] thinking about and this is what I'm
[29:43] doing and she just doesn't want to hear
[29:46] it she doesn't want to talk about
[29:47] Bitcoin and I don't really know why I
[29:50] don't I haven't got under the skin of it
[29:53] maybe you know I don't need to get under
[29:54] the skin of it she said that she's not
[29:56] interested she doesn't want to talk
[29:57] about it it so it is what it is I
[30:00] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[30:04] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece

[32:11] absolutely it's you have to take it slow
[32:14] uh I I've noticed that the family
[32:17] members that are closest to me even
[32:19] though I stopped orange buing them they
[32:21] just come to bitcoin more so if you look
[32:24] like uh my girlfriend my sister my mom
[32:27] dad a cousin of mine that is really a
[32:30] lot in contact with me they all got
[32:32] Bitcoin but then there there's like this
[32:34] Outer Circle that still in my family but
[32:36] not as much in contact with me they
[32:39] don't so like it's a little bit you have
[32:42] to be the orange sun in the in the
[32:44] family and try uh to just uh be be that
[32:47] Bitcoin voice I guess um but it's it's
[32:50] not not easy to be the Bitcoin always
[32:53] because everyone has an opinion on
[32:54] bitcoin and usually the opinion comes
[32:56] from some headline in some newspaper
[32:59] yeah and and the newspapers have done an
[33:03] incredibly amazing job at just spreading
[33:07] lies and spreading total fiction about
[33:09] it um and and if that's the stuff that
[33:13] most people are still reading then it's
[33:15] not surprising that most everyday people
[33:18] just think either it's a scam or it's
[33:20] bad for the environment and we know it's
[33:23] neither of those things but I also you
[33:25] know I don't want to make it my job to
[33:28] just try and convince people who aren't
[33:30] even willing to entertain the idea I've
[33:34] got better things to do than that how
[33:36] did you overcome that did you had before
[33:39] also those the narratives in the head
[33:41] and and how did you then overcome it was
[33:43] it just that friend that uh orange
[33:45] spilled you in the evening or did you
[33:46] had to do a lot of research afterwards
[33:49] um I actually hadn't absorbed any of
[33:52] that that bad narrative because I
[33:55] basically just ignored Bitcoin
[33:56] altogether right so I'd ignored
[33:58] everything about it um so when I came to
[34:03] bitcoin it was because I was listening
[34:05] to people that believe in it I wasn't
[34:07] having to um destroy all the bad
[34:11] information that I'd absorbed because I
[34:13] hadn't absorbed any of it I was like a
[34:15] blank slate which was actually really
[34:17] nice uh but I think one of the reasons
[34:21] why the whole concept appeals to me so
[34:25] much is because freedom is is a
[34:28] fundamental value for me all sorts of
[34:31] Freedom you know freedom to live where
[34:33] you want freedom to um the fre freedom
[34:38] of speech free everything freedom of
[34:41] expression freedom to manage my own
[34:44] money and not be told by a government
[34:46] that oh no no you're just a little silly
[34:49] little human you you shouldn't be
[34:51] allowed to put your money into things
[34:52] like this because you don't even
[34:54] understand you know I don't like that
[34:56] sort of
[34:58] um treatment of people I believe in
[35:02] Freedom and accountability those two
[35:05] things give people
[35:06] freedom and let's hold each other
[35:08] accountable if we do really shitty
[35:10] things great other than that just leave
[35:13] me alone let me live my life and and so
[35:16] Bitcoin feeds so nicely into that it's
[35:19] ultimate freedom because you just step
[35:22] back and say I'm not having anything to
[35:24] do with your messed up Financial system
[35:28] I disagree with it and I'm just going to
[35:31] do my own thing I'm not going to spend
[35:33] my time trying to fight you I don't care
[35:36] I'm going to go do my own thing because
[35:37] I'm free and I'm free to do it that's
[35:40] what really appeals to me that
[35:42] freedom and it's it's kind of under
[35:45] attack in in in the UK I I heard I I
[35:48] don't know about a lot a whole lot about
[35:51] it but I just heard that people getting
[35:53] arrested just for having said something
[35:56] online do you know something about it is
[35:59] there something to that or is it just
[36:01] yeah so there were there have been some
[36:04] really tricky events that happened in
[36:06] the UK over the summer very soon after
[36:09] the new government got into power and
[36:12] there's lots
[36:13] of conflicting opinions about it one
[36:18] thing that I do know is that we now seem
[36:21] to have this thing called a non crime
[36:26] hate incident
[36:28] and the police can come and question you
[36:30] just because someone has made a
[36:33] complaint that you had said you've said
[36:35] something mean so you've not committed a
[36:38] crime but someone has said you are a
[36:40] hateful person whatever the hate might
[36:42] be related to but it's not a crime and
[36:44] they can record that against your name
[36:47] and it will come up in searches against
[36:50] your name that is a really scary
[36:53] situation for a country that's meant to
[36:55] be a free Nation you know Britain likes
[36:58] to act as though it's the granddaddy of
[37:00] the world and this is what we are doing
[37:04] to the citizens so there's there's a lot
[37:07] of different factors at play here but if
[37:11] you really want to look at how messed up
[37:13] things are just Google non-crime hate
[37:15] incidents in the UK and you'll see how
[37:18] dark that is because if that comes up
[37:20] against your name and uh an employer is
[37:24] doing a search on you what sort of
[37:26] impact is that going to have on a on a
[37:28] person's job prospects on their ability
[37:30] to you know get employed it's hard
[37:33] enough for actual criminals after
[37:36] they've served their time to then get a
[37:40] job and these are people who have
[37:42] committed an actual crime whatever the
[37:44] crime might be and we always say that oh
[37:46] we should re rehabilitate offenders you
[37:49] know incorporate them back into society
[37:51] well a non-me non-crime hate incident
[37:54] it's not even a crime and we are
[37:57] labeling people so I don't know what's
[38:00] going on in this
[38:01] country I might have it all wrong but it
[38:05] doesn't feel right to me and so it's
[38:09] just another part of my resistance
[38:13] to I don't know the
[38:16] machine yeah do you give any thoughts to
[38:20] moving away from that is just any
[38:23] thoughts from your side like ah like if
[38:25] if it continues that way I'm going
[38:28] somewhere else no I'm going to stay here
[38:30] forever and pay all my taxes like a good
[38:32] citizen should I not thinking at all
[38:35] about how I can escape the UK don't even
[38:38] ask me questions like that because the
[38:40] government will probably send someone
[38:42] knocking at my door I I hope not
[38:46] yeah we we have to think about that
[38:48] things but it's good that you stay in
[38:50] the UK and pay
[38:53] taxes I mean look uh there is apparently
[38:57] a think tank in the UK that is advising
[38:59] the government and one of the things
[39:01] that they're advising them on is
[39:03] introducing exit
[39:05] taxes they haven't done it yet but I
[39:08] think the government that we've got in
[39:10] charge at the moment it's just a matter
[39:12] of time give it another 2 three years
[39:14] there will be an exit tax for anyone
[39:16] that wants to leave this country doesn't
[39:19] matter how rich or not rich they are I'm
[39:21] not rich but if I decide I want to leave
[39:24] the country there will probably be an
[39:25] exit tax and that really really winds me
[39:28] up because what that means is a country
[39:32] is realizing we should tax people for
[39:36] daring to not want to live here anymore
[39:39] instead of making this place a place
[39:41] where we would want to
[39:43] stay and yeah yeah it's it's a little
[39:46] bit like you throw a party and it's so
[39:50] bad that everyone wants to leave but you
[39:52] you you kind of want to close the doors
[39:54] so people cannot get out it's w
[39:58] if your country is so great you don't
[40:00] need an axit tax because you will have
[40:03] such an high influx of people uh and and
[40:06] people don't want to leave and that that
[40:09] that's incentive you should you should
[40:11] give and not like I like oh wait we we
[40:14] screwed up we we should not let them go
[40:16] because they will go otherwise that that
[40:19] should be a sign if if if a country has
[40:22] no a attx and then all of the sudden
[40:24] installs an a tax this is probably the
[40:26] best side
[40:27] to know that there is something very
[40:29] wrong about that
[40:32] country and and I think there's you know
[40:35] I mentioned that I recommended to my
[40:38] client to read the Bitcoin standard and
[40:40] resistance money because those two books
[40:42] I think are absolutely amazing the other
[40:45] book that I read over the summer which I
[40:47] think it's because all these all
[40:49] bitcoiners are always talking about it
[40:51] is the sovereign individual and it was
[40:54] when I started reading the sovereign
[40:56] individual in July I think it was that's
[40:59] when I decided okay self- custody
[41:01] priority number one and I was working my
[41:03] way through the book and that's when I
[41:05] was realizing that everything that
[41:07] they're saying in that book it was
[41:08] written in
[41:10] 1997 so much of the stuff that they said
[41:12] in that book is happening now and if we
[41:17] take what's happening now to the
[41:21] conclusions that the book comes to like
[41:24] it's going to get way worse over here
[41:26] before it gets better
[41:28] and
[41:29] that's a little bit scary and yes it
[41:32] does make me want to leave the UK but
[41:34] that's also not a realistic option for
[41:36] me right now but I'm working very hard
[41:38] in my business stacking a lot of
[41:41] SATs as many as I can so that if I do
[41:46] want to leave at some point then I
[41:49] can yeah and then then probably your
[41:52] Bitcoin gets stolen no or boting
[41:55] accidents or something like that oh that
[41:58] oh it might get lost yeah it's not going
[42:01] to get stolen but yeah it might get
[42:04] lost yeah I think uh I thought about
[42:07] that I mean that's not an advice please
[42:10] do everything legally uh not not to you
[42:12] and not to any listener but I was like a
[42:15] boating accident is probably a a bad
[42:19] excuse we always have that Meme of a
[42:21] boating accident but at some point you
[42:23] want to move your Bitcoin somewhere uh
[42:27] and and if you say they are stolen you
[42:30] probably end up on a list uh no if you
[42:32] say they are lost you probably end up on
[42:34] a list you then you're on a different
[42:36] country and the Bitcoin all of the
[42:38] sudden moves again so maybe it's just a
[42:40] better way to say like yeah my laptop
[42:42] got hacked I don't know how this
[42:43] happened I don't know I've thought about
[42:46] that boating meme uh boating accident
[42:48] meme a lot and the more I think about it
[42:51] the more I think like maybe it's not a
[42:53] good idea to to even have that Mee
[42:56] because I think it's a bad idea to do
[42:58] and if we have that Meme at some someone
[43:01] will do it someone probably actually
[43:07] did I'm sure that there are some very
[43:11] creative people out there who have found
[43:14] their own way to make their own kind of
[43:17] new boating accident um and if they
[43:21] have that's good luck to them uh I know
[43:26] that the you know I'm just like a normal
[43:29] person in the UK anything that I decide
[43:31] to do probably going to have to do
[43:33] everything above board and we should do
[43:35] it above board like you were saying um
[43:39] but it's just not a consideration right
[43:41] now right now I'm just going to keep
[43:43] building my business see what happens
[43:45] with it and then decide in a couple more
[43:48] years I'm not going anywhere absolutely
[43:51] that that that's beautiful um what are
[43:54] your favorite memes in in Bitcoin so far
[43:56] as you have flown as we just talked
[43:58] about the boating accident Meme and
[44:01] there are so many and I think like even
[44:04] like uh memes is such an powerful
[44:07] message but have you some favorites U my
[44:11] favorite one at the moment is the one of
[44:13] Sailor kind of doing this turn and just
[44:16] staring at the guy next to him I can't
[44:18] remember who it is but my God the look
[44:20] in his eyes it's amazing that's my
[44:23] favorite and my second favorite again is
[44:26] a sailor meme where some it's not a meme
[44:28] but someone put together a super cut of
[44:31] every single time he's been on a TV
[44:33] interview or a zoom interview and he
[44:35] sigh and he just sits there and he
[44:37] goes that one I love that it's
[44:41] just um sigh after sigh after sigh after
[44:44] sigh and it's so funny I love how he
[44:47] just cannot hide what he's thinking like
[44:50] his emotions are completely his feelings
[44:52] about something are just completely
[44:53] there on his face total frustration just
[44:56] I can't believe believe how stupid you
[44:58] are whatever he's thinking you can see
[45:00] it on his face I love that I think it's
[45:03] hilarious I just try to to pull it up uh
[45:08] it's wait here I it's not big
[45:11] unfortunately but maybe I can show it it
[45:14] it's it's with Scotty pipp or pip I
[45:18] don't know how to P yeah Scotty
[45:20] Pippin uh and it and it's right right
[45:23] that you mean right that one yes it's
[45:26] just too funny that that was amazing he
[45:29] he met
[45:31] satosi that that that's that's a really
[45:34] great uh meme yeah Michael has a lot of
[45:36] a lot of freaking memes yeah he he he's
[45:39] a he I think he probably never met made
[45:43] a meme himself but he is in so many
[45:46] memes in there like a lot I mean he's
[45:49] just just a never ending source of
[45:51] material his facial expressions are just
[45:55] it's they're there you just got to use
[45:57] them absolutely um one more thing uh
[46:01] about the community um which interests
[46:03] me a lot especially because you new to
[46:06] the space how how did you get like how
[46:11] do I phrase that um how do you see the
[46:14] Bitcoin Community overall uh the podcast
[46:17] Community the Twitter Community the
[46:19] in-person community I know there's a lot
[46:21] of differences between those if you see
[46:24] the Bitcoin Twitter Community versus
[46:25] seeing them in in person uh I think
[46:28] especially when you're on Twitter you
[46:30] get
[46:31] that um you get the feeling that yeah
[46:34] Bitcoin communities a bunch of male
[46:36] people that only eat carnivore that only
[46:39] lift weights that use no sunscreen like
[46:42] all those all those things and they
[46:44] might be good things but like not
[46:46] everyone is like that uh and so how how
[46:50] do you look at the Bitcoin community and
[46:52] what is your like first impression I
[46:55] guess it's fair to say it's still a
[46:56] first impression in the first like six
[46:58] month yeah definitely uh the real life
[47:02] Community doesn't come across as a bunch
[47:06] of people who are strictly following the
[47:09] carnivore diet or you know lift bench
[47:11] pressing and and lifting weights every
[47:14] single day it's just normal regular
[47:16] people that are connecting with each
[47:18] other just being really friendly and
[47:20] really supportive and if the community
[47:22] stays like that I think the community
[47:24] has a really long and positive future
[47:27] ahead of it I am only really um I'm only
[47:32] meeting bitcoiners I'm only going to
[47:35] bitcoin events Bitcoin only uh I haven't
[47:39] quite got rid of the shitcoins that I
[47:42] bought right at the beginning of April
[47:44] still got a few of them sitting around
[47:46] but they're doing okay so that's nice uh
[47:49] but otherwise I'm Bitcoin only and
[47:51] events of Bitcoin only as well I
[47:53] actually booked myself to go to Prague
[47:55] next year so I'm really looking looking
[47:57] forward to that I'm going to be in
[47:58] Prague for the conference and I think in
[48:03] terms of any other first impressions
[48:05] people are so friendly and helpful you
[48:08] know I gave one talk and from that one
[48:11] talk I got a place on a course I got
[48:13] invited to join the women of Bitcoin
[48:15] leadership team and I got introduced to
[48:19] you that's just amazing there's a guy
[48:22] who I was introduced to who's going to
[48:24] be helping me set up my node I haven't
[48:27] done it yet cuz I just haven't had time
[48:29] but I'm going to be setting up a node
[48:31] all these things are happening because
[48:32] I've met people in real
[48:34] life so it's an it's an amazing
[48:37] Community yeah and and it's like open um
[48:43] open people coming into open Community
[48:45] is is just a really good mixture like
[48:47] you you you will uh like it's it's a
[48:50] good mixture for for crowing uh
[48:53] personally but also the the community
[48:54] itself it's really really nice um on
[48:57] that note what are you kind of thoughts
[48:59] on the on the on the year that for me
[49:02] it's kind of crazy year with like the
[49:04] presidential election with the Bitcoin
[49:06] ETFs with almost 100K now with the
[49:09] Haring that we had in there like what
[49:10] what are some some of your thoughts of
[49:12] of of the 2024 year that still goes for
[49:15] month I
[49:16] think um so I don't know if there's
[49:20] something wrong with me but I have no
[49:23] kind of feelings about all the different
[49:24] price movements that have been happening
[49:27] cuz I've I'm just like
[49:31] whatever I don't know if I'm some sort
[49:33] of Bitcoin robot or something cuz I see
[49:36] so many people online get very excited
[49:40] at an upwards move and then and then
[49:43] freaking out when there's a downwards
[49:45] move and the moves aren't even that big
[49:49] this year so I'm just like I'm here and
[49:53] I'm here to stay and let's just have
[49:56] some fun while we're here but I'm not
[49:58] going to even though I keep looking at
[50:00] the price the price isn't stressing me
[50:02] out at all I'm not getting OV excited at
[50:05] the level it's at now compared to where
[50:07] it was in you know April or
[50:10] May and even if it fell back to that or
[50:14] or lower I don't think I'd care because
[50:17] I've gone into this knowing whatever I
[50:20] put in needs to stay there for at least
[50:23] two cycles so doesn't matter you know
[50:26] you're make me way more bullish than I
[50:28] was even more bullish than I was before
[50:31] because you are one amazing example of
[50:33] someone fresh coming into the space uh
[50:37] coming really quickly to bitcoin only
[50:39] not going uh a long shitcoin route which
[50:42] usually was in the previous Cycles um
[50:46] really educated uh knowing the
[50:49] difference between uh exchange and self-
[50:52] custody uh
[50:54] and I I usually when I'd ask people how
[50:57] they got into Bitcoin or how what's the
[51:00] story about um and they are from like
[51:03] two years four years eight years ago
[51:06] they always say like yeah I came in
[51:07] shitcoin Phase self custody lesson all
[51:11] those things it seems like we now build
[51:14] the
[51:15] infrastructure and the courses and the
[51:18] the podcasts and the content graders and
[51:20] whatever you need for that to make to
[51:24] learn actually from all the previous
[51:26] mistakes the community has made to come
[51:28] quicker into the right lane so this
[51:31] actually makes me a this actually makes
[51:34] me really bullish to see what's to come
[51:38] when we now really shorten this learning
[51:40] curve for being a Bitcoin if there's
[51:43] such a thing like a
[51:45] Bitcoin if you have the time to spend on
[51:48] it you can
[51:50] really supercharge your learning on
[51:53] bitcoin exactly because of what you said
[51:55] the number of resources that are out
[51:57] there is nuts there's so much
[51:59] information out there and good quality
[52:01] information out there that I had I've
[52:04] had the time this year or I've made the
[52:06] time this year if I'd spent a bit more
[52:08] time working on my business I might have
[52:09] even more money to put into Bitcoin but
[52:11] it's fine it's worked out the way that I
[52:13] like it if you can access the
[52:16] information so easily you know whether
[52:19] it's listening to podcasts or I like
[52:22] podcasts and I like books and it's just
[52:24] so easy it's so easy easy so I hope
[52:28] you're right anyone who's new that comes
[52:30] into it they have a much easier path to
[52:34] just going full Bitcoin absolutely and
[52:37] uh we the people still get the price
[52:39] they deserve but they can come quicker
[52:42] in and they don't have to lose as much
[52:44] money as they earli as did I I think
[52:48] I've never met someone that has been
[52:51] there since early like 2017 or earlier
[52:54] than that that have not lost lost at
[52:56] least like onethird or half of the
[52:58] Bitcoin stack because of some stupid
[53:01] mistake um I
[53:03] was I did not lose actually I mean the
[53:06] way I lost is it took me a long time to
[53:08] go all in uh from from 2020 this was my
[53:11] first time and it took me to 2021 to
[53:14] actually go all in so a solid year to to
[53:17] to realize that but yeah it's it's been
[53:19] a it's been a great journey and the the
[53:22] resources have really been uh developing
[53:24] is there anything that you observed as
[53:28] someone that comes a little bit newer to
[53:29] the space anything else that you you
[53:32] think is really interesting that I might
[53:34] have forgotten to to ask or
[53:36] mention I think um it's not that you
[53:40] forgot to ask it's it's just I just
[53:43] can't get over how much the spirit of
[53:47] Bitcoin matches with my way of seeing
[53:51] the world I just could not have
[53:52] predicted that the way you know the
[53:55] world that I wish we live lived in that
[53:57] kind of freedom for people but also that
[54:00] accountability you don't just get to do
[54:02] crazy stuff have some accountability for
[54:04] the things that we do so whether that's
[54:07] our politicians or financial system down
[54:09] to just how people interact with each
[54:12] other on a day-to-day basis now you know
[54:14] the the crap we see on social media and
[54:17] how people talk to each other in real
[54:19] life as well like have let's create a a
[54:23] better planet we we it seems like we
[54:25] used to have one and we've kind of lost
[54:27] our way a little bit so that kind of um
[54:32] freedom and accountability towards each
[54:34] other which is exactly what Bitcoin is
[54:36] about freedom and accountability to
[54:38] yourself you know you can't blame anyone
[54:41] else for the things that might go wrong
[54:42] when you're a Bitcoin holder uh you have
[54:45] to just you know make sure you're paying
[54:48] attention to what's going on well we
[54:49] need to do that everywhere and in
[54:52] general not just kind of walk around on
[54:54] autopilot not thinking about
[54:57] the impact of all these big big
[54:59] decisions that our countries and
[55:01] governments are making that's that's the
[55:03] main thing really really cool I think
[55:05] that's a that's a great Insight um I ask
[55:08] all my guests what can we learn from you
[55:11] besides
[55:15] Bitcoin oh God uh I didn't prepare
[55:18] anything for that let's see what can you
[55:20] learn from me besides Bitcoin I think I
[55:23] guess going back to what I was just
[55:24] saying that people people need to maybe
[55:29] remember that all the things that might
[55:33] upset you that someone might do to upset
[55:36] you that doesn't mean you can't do
[55:38] things to upset other people so just be
[55:41] a little bit more rational
[55:44] in the fixes that you ask for from
[55:47] another person CU whatever you ask for
[55:51] you better be prepared to give as well
[55:53] really cool we have enter in the podcast
[55:56] where the previous guest is asking a
[55:59] question for the next guest without
[56:00] knowing who the next guest actually is
[56:02] and uh this is an interesting one
[56:04] because the previous answer all almost
[56:08] fit already there but maybe you have
[56:10] something else to share what's the best
[56:12] advice you ever
[56:17] got um by Bitcoin doesn't count
[56:22] yeah um okay so this is some advice I
[56:25] was given when I was about 10 years into
[56:28] my career working in financial services
[56:31] my manager at the time who was a really
[56:33] good manager and he said to me never
[56:38] have loyalty to your company because
[56:40] your company will chew you up and spit
[56:44] you out but if you have a good manager
[56:48] have loyalty to your manager and I think
[56:51] because in today's day and age people
[56:53] are kind of really worried always about
[56:55] their jobs and their employers some you
[56:58] know treat them
[57:00] badly if you are in a situation where
[57:02] your company is treating you badly do
[57:05] what you can to get out of there and
[57:06] just get a better job if you can I know
[57:08] that's not easy but do that because that
[57:12] actually that advice really stuck with
[57:14] me in my career and it helped me make
[57:17] good
[57:18] decisions in my career and I think
[57:21] that because it's plays such a huge part
[57:25] you know how you earn your money how
[57:26] much money you earn that is freedom for
[57:30] a lot of people you've got to make good
[57:33] decisions you can't just sit back and
[57:35] just let your life happen without paying
[57:38] attention to it you have to be aware you
[57:41] have to be present that's especially
[57:44] right now I think even I uh because I
[57:47] work in social media basically it's
[57:49] really hard to to to get stuck in like
[57:52] uh you you're you're watching something
[57:54] you're eating something you're you're
[57:56] you're doing always like three five
[57:57] things at once and there's always
[58:00] something popping in the phone uh so
[58:02] that that's a that's a hard thing to do
[58:04] and staying focused staying present and
[58:07] being being aware of of of things uh
[58:10] yeah I I love that a lot really cool
[58:12] perfect and thank you so much harell for
[58:14] for being on the show before I let you
[58:16] go where can people find you ask your
[58:18] questions do you have social media
[58:20] profiles um I do I've set up a brand new
[58:24] social media profile because of a side
[58:27] project that I'm working on so if I can
[58:29] share that yeah it's barely come to life
[58:32] so hopefully by the time this comes out
[58:34] I'll have done something on it it's the
[58:36] website is called a free existence.
[58:39] comom and the Twitter handle the X
[58:42] handle is the same thing a free
[58:45] existence because I just want to I I
[58:48] just want a space to kind of take
[58:50] everything that's in here and put it
[58:52] somewhere and it's not just going to be
[58:54] about Bitcoin but what I'm hoping is
[58:56] over time I'll get other people to share
[59:00] what Freedom means to them as well not
[59:03] just my ideas of what freedom is but for
[59:06] people to share with me what their ideas
[59:08] of Freedom are as well so people can
[59:10] find me on a free existence. comom um
[59:13] and at a free existence on Twitter um
[59:17] you know all my other work stuff that's
[59:19] boring who
[59:20] cares thank you so much yeah I think
[59:23] that's that's that's great uh what
[59:25] you're trying to achieve and I'm really
[59:26] looking forward to your learning curve
[59:28] in the first six month and maybe we do
[59:30] it one year from now and then it's like
[59:32] how far you've gotten I think it would
[59:34] be really great to to look back at that
[59:36] thank you so much for being on also
[59:38] thank you so much for everyone that is
[59:39] watching and listening for joining us
[59:40] today as always I'll be back tomorrow
