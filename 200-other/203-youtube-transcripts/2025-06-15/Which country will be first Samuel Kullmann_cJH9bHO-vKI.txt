[00:00] the next smart option if you cannot
[00:01] fight it as a government is is to adopt
[00:03] it and we're really in a race we're in a
[00:05] race about which country makes the first
[00:08] move it's one of the most important
[00:10] geopolitical questions of the decade
[00:13] najib has really been stacking hard for
[00:15] his country and I think it will make El
[00:17] Salvador a first world country within 5
[00:19] to 10 years what Bitcoin achieved is to
[00:22] remove the sinful nature of mankind from
[00:25] the financial system because it's based
[00:27] on rules and not rulers having a sound
[00:30] monetary base that is not robbing people
[00:32] of their savings it's just something
[00:36] beautiful I researched and I got to know
[00:39] that politicians are the six is the
[00:41] sixth most hated job on
[00:43] Earth and not only are you a politician
[00:46] you're also in Bitcoin which is an
[00:49] interesting um thought experiment
[00:51] because politicians as as we all know
[00:54] are um maybe misunderstood May it's the
[00:57] most one of the most hated jobs on on
[00:59] Earth and Bitcoin is also widely
[01:01] misunderstood and bitcoiners especially
[01:04] those who make early money who are long
[01:06] in there uh maybe people are also like
[01:10] yeah
[01:12] um you have to uh explain it to people
[01:15] well and you have to explain it good to
[01:17] people to really understand what Bitcoin
[01:19] is and uh if you're a bitcoiner you
[01:22] sometimes have this experience in the
[01:24] normal society that you have all this
[01:27] fat going on with with people coming to
[01:29] like um what first of all what drives
[01:32] you to be in both and where do you see
[01:34] the connection also and what is your
[01:35] experience being in in both areas so I
[01:39] got interested in politics when I was 14
[01:41] years old I grew up in Mongolia I lived
[01:44] there 12 years and even during that time
[01:47] during my teenage years uh I became
[01:49] interested in politics and then when I
[01:51] was 16 years old and my family moved
[01:54] back to Switzerland I almost immediately
[01:56] started to become politically active and
[01:59] I always had on my heart to fight for
[02:01] justice and uh so one of my main
[02:06] political issues I've been fighting for
[02:08] is uh combating human
[02:10] trafficking um because almost no one
[02:13] else takes it on and it's just such a
[02:16] great Injustice that is mostly tolerated
[02:19] or people think well it's just there and
[02:22] we can do nothing about it but I don't
[02:24] believe that's true so um yeah I went
[02:28] into politics because I want to uh have
[02:31] a positive impact on
[02:33] society um in Switzerland many people go
[02:36] into politics because of their yeah view
[02:40] of the world because they want to have a
[02:43] positive impact on on society while
[02:45] actually most out of places on the
[02:48] planet mostly people go into politics
[02:50] because of money so uh I mean you
[02:54] discussed uh these studies that say
[02:57] politicians are quite hated and
[03:00] uh it it is understandable so on the one
[03:03] hand depending on which country you are
[03:05] in uh politicians really only look after
[03:08] themselves and try to get as rich as
[03:10] possible in as quick uh yeah in as
[03:14] little time as possible uh but then on
[03:17] the other hand politicians who just also
[03:20] stand for certain values stand for
[03:21] certain things and uh I'm myself I'm in
[03:24] a smaller party in Switzerland so we're
[03:27] not exactly mainstream so we stand for
[03:29] things that um maybe that are not really
[03:33] accepted in the large part of society so
[03:37] uh also in this regard uh you get a lot
[03:39] of uh confrontation and people maybe not
[03:43] liking you because not maybe because
[03:46] you're greedy or corrupt but simply
[03:48] because of the things the political
[03:50] issues you stand for so that's maybe on
[03:53] the politics side and um regarding
[03:56] Bitcoin I started to dive into the uh
[04:00] work how the financial system works in
[04:02] 2015 and I quickly realized it's really
[04:05] corrupt and the the Fiat the Fiat system
[04:08] is deeply deeply problematic and so at
[04:12] first I thought that the solution would
[04:14] be gold and silver so I really quickly
[04:17] became a gold and silver bug and also
[04:19] started to advise people how they can
[04:21] take um their savings out of the banking
[04:24] system put it into gold and silver and
[04:26] slow and I knew I knew in 2015 that
[04:29] there was something like Bitcoin but I
[04:31] never really researched it uh deeply uh
[04:35] so it was only a very very slow journey
[04:37] of just looking from time to time again
[04:40] looking at Bitcoin trying to understand
[04:42] it giving up on trying to understand it
[04:45] but then trying again some sometime
[04:48] later and then in 2020 I read the
[04:51] Bitcoin standard by by saaden Mo and
[04:53] that was my first gradually then
[04:57] suddenly moment actually actually the
[04:59] book but also an interview uh by Mark
[05:02] fedik with Michael sailor I think those
[05:05] two those two things were really my my
[05:08] the the push into the Bitcoin rapbit
[05:10] hole for me and since then I've also
[05:15] really uh advocated for Bitcoin publicly
[05:18] as a politician uh and actually just two
[05:21] days ago I filed for political
[05:23] initiatives in the parliament of Canton
[05:25] B Swiss Canton B uh to uh to have a
[05:30] um Cal Bitcoin strategy So I myself I'm
[05:34] I'm a member of parliament in C of B in
[05:38] Switzerland that's amazing and I think
[05:40] also um when we talk about the studies
[05:42] how politicians are um not looked at
[05:46] well I think Swiss is actually different
[05:48] I don't know if it's actually like that
[05:50] but I think in Swiss political the
[05:53] politician system is way more directly
[05:56] and there's way more um exchange uh
[06:01] going on and communication going on um
[06:03] between the citizens and the politicians
[06:05] as I understand it from from the outside
[06:08] I'm not located in the Swiss um so maybe
[06:11] it's it's different in in Swiss than
[06:14] most of my listeners are actually from
[06:15] America from the UK from Canada um maybe
[06:19] for those who don't know the Swiss
[06:21] political system how do you say would
[06:25] you say is it different uh in a on a big
[06:28] scale than let's say the American system
[06:31] or what's most in most European
[06:34] countries the system UK obviously um
[06:37] Swiss decided from the beginning to not
[06:39] be in the European Union which is also a
[06:42] differentiator between almost all the
[06:44] other
[06:47] countries yes so um actually I also
[06:50] wrote an article uh on this issue on the
[06:52] political system of Switzerland also for
[06:54] my International audience so I can
[06:56] quickly summarize what three aspect make
[07:00] the political system of Switzerland
[07:01] quite unique and as you mentioned we're
[07:04] not part of the European Union I think
[07:06] one of the main reasons is that uh Swiss
[07:09] citizens are allowed to decide thism so
[07:12] we have direct democracy we're not the
[07:15] only country in the world that has
[07:16] direct democracy many American states
[07:18] have direct democracy on the state level
[07:21] but not of course not on the US national
[07:24] level uh but in Switzerland direct
[07:27] Democratic rights are very strong so we
[07:30] vote on four times a year we vote on
[07:33] different policy issues um amendments to
[07:37] the Constitution of Switzerland but also
[07:40] referendums on laws so if politicians
[07:43] want to join the European Union in
[07:45] Switzerland they have to sell it to our
[07:48] to the voters first and swiss voters are
[07:52] overwhelm overwhelmingly against joining
[07:54] the European Union by like 80 to 90% so
[07:59] uh uh it's impossible uh under these
[08:02] conditions for politicians just to say
[08:04] we want to go into the European Union so
[08:06] I think that's one of the big strengths
[08:08] of our political system that there's
[08:09] this feedback loop between uh citizens
[08:12] and politicians so politicians once
[08:14] they're elected they're still being
[08:16] controlled by by the citizens in like in
[08:19] the most important policy questions it's
[08:21] not the politicians who make the final
[08:23] decision but but actually the the
[08:25] citizens so I think that's great and in
[08:28] this regard Switz has the um the
[08:31] strongest direct Democratic rights in
[08:33] all of of the world so our citizens
[08:36] voted on more policy questions than
[08:39] almost all of the world combined in the
[08:41] past 150 years so that's aspect number
[08:44] one direct democracy aspect number two
[08:46] is not totally unique it's federalism uh
[08:50] federalism we know it's there in Germany
[08:52] in Austria in the United States in
[08:55] Canada but in Switzerland it's uh you
[08:58] can measure it actually by how much
[09:00] money how much taxpayer money is spent
[09:02] on the cantonal level on the provincial
[09:04] level and that's the second highest in
[09:07] the world only Canada uh the Canadian
[09:10] provinces they spend more taxpayer money
[09:13] on the provincial level in Switzerland
[09:15] it's about 45% of all taxpayer money
[09:18] that is spent on the provincial level
[09:20] and only onethird on the national level
[09:22] so having a high degree of federalism uh
[09:26] is not totally unique uh in the world
[09:29] but it is one of the aspects that make
[09:31] the Swiss uh political system as it is
[09:35] and then there is one aspect the third
[09:37] aspect which makes the political system
[09:39] of Switzerland totally unique you have
[09:42] it nowhere else in the world which is
[09:44] team government so Switzerland is not
[09:48] governed by one strong prime minister or
[09:51] president but there is a team of seven a
[09:54] college of seven ministers that share
[09:57] power equally and they take turns in
[10:01] being president of Switzerland annually
[10:03] so every year we have a peaceful
[10:05] transition I mean the the president is
[10:08] then not more powerful than the other
[10:09] six in the government but he'll he'll
[10:12] have more representative functions so uh
[10:15] having a team government I believe has
[10:19] helped us to have extraordinary
[10:21] political stability uh so we didn't have
[10:24] any armed conflict in Switzerland since
[10:28] 1847 and so I believe we had a lot of
[10:31] economic Prosperity because of that also
[10:34] partly due to to due to this political
[10:38] stability um and it also uh I believe
[10:42] it's also one of the reasons why people
[10:44] in Switzerland are most satisfied with
[10:47] democracy in the world there have been
[10:49] studies done and satisfaction with
[10:52] democracy has fallen below 50% for
[10:55] example in the United States or the
[10:57] United Kingdom while in Switz and it's
[10:59] been increasing even uh even so that
[11:03] Swiss citizens are most satisfied with
[11:05] democracy in the world so these are the
[11:07] three big aspects and then there's maybe
[11:09] a smaller aspect which is that
[11:11] politicians are not really paid too well
[11:14] in Switzerland so uh which I think is
[11:16] also good so there are fewer incentives
[11:19] to go into politics because of money
[11:22] yeah I think Austria actually has one of
[11:23] the highest salaries in the world for
[11:26] politicians uh I don't know the exact
[11:29] ICS but I think in the last election it
[11:31] it came up that Austrian politicians are
[11:33] really well paid compared even to other
[11:36] politicians I think the Austrian uh like
[11:39] the official salary of course
[11:41] politicians make
[11:43] also other ways money uh but in the
[11:46] direct way it's really unique for me
[11:48] Swiss and I think there's also the
[11:49] connection to bitcoin there because
[11:51] there's no um 100% leader of course in
[11:55] Bitcoin it's like way more decentralized
[11:57] there's not a team of seven people that
[11:59] has control over the Bitcoin network but
[12:01] this is like unique to to it and the
[12:03] direct democracy it's like in Bitcoin
[12:05] like if if everybody decides to do
[12:08] something with Bitcoin then it will be
[12:10] done uh and this is something uh also
[12:13] like the comparison to to Swiss and for
[12:15] me interesting is that usually the
[12:18] adoption is the highest in the country
[12:20] that needed the most I think Nigeria is
[12:22] still the country with the highest
[12:23] Bitcoin adoption why because they need
[12:26] it it's it's it's it's simple like that
[12:30] but Swiss is unique because it has a
[12:33] really strong currency with the Swiss
[12:34] frank it's probably one of the highest
[12:37] one of the strongest currencies in the
[12:39] world it's the best shitcoin it's the
[12:41] best Fiat shitcoin there is in the world
[12:45] exactly and so uh Swiss people would not
[12:50] need uh like all the other countries
[12:53] need Bitcoin more than the Swiss people
[12:57] but it seemingly is the adoption quite
[12:59] good I heard about Beach Bitcoin that
[13:02] they don't have a Swiss bank account uh
[13:04] they only live on bit on a Bitcoin
[13:06] standard uh I'm I'm still curious how
[13:08] this how she is doing that uh there you
[13:11] can pay taxes some in some uh districts
[13:14] with Bitcoin you have Lugano where you
[13:16] can pay almost everything in Bitcoin
[13:19] Canton souk I heard is really friendly
[13:22] to to bitcoin and crypto in general uh
[13:24] so why is it in in Swiss that
[13:28] politicians and and Regulation and even
[13:30] also the people I the Swiss people that
[13:33] I speak it's like they are more open to
[13:35] the idea of sound money the idea of gold
[13:38] and then obviously Bitcoin is just a
[13:40] digital version and the next evolution
[13:42] of that then they all more open to that
[13:44] like is is that a is this from
[13:47] historical coming is this from the
[13:50] direct democracy what is the reason why
[13:52] Swiss people are so keen on
[13:54] bitcoin so I think pain economic pain is
[13:59] one factor it's an important factor but
[14:01] if economic pain was the only Factor
[14:04] then I believe it a Bitcoin adoption
[14:07] would be highest in Zimbabwe or uh
[14:09] Lebanon which I mean there are there's
[14:12] some Bitcoin adoption of course but it's
[14:14] not the highest so it's a combination of
[14:16] different factors I think in Nigeria uh
[14:20] it's also young population so having
[14:23] young mines is also very important it's
[14:25] a quite a tech saavy population at least
[14:29] in the in the maybe in the centers in
[14:31] the big
[14:32] cities uh and why I I mean in
[14:35] Switzerland it's also quite High Bitcoin
[14:38] adoption uh compared to other countries
[14:40] and I think there there are several
[14:42] reasons so I think what you mentioned is
[14:44] with sound money the Swiss frank was
[14:47] backed by gold at least partially up
[14:49] until the
[14:51] 1990s uh and so we still have a quite
[14:54] strong understanding of the importance
[14:56] of gold and silver um of cash uh like
[15:01] people still pay a lot in cash not like
[15:03] in the Nordic countries like Sweden and
[15:06] we are sort of aware that we have a like
[15:09] a stable quite stable currency This Ss
[15:11] Frank had the slowest money expansion in
[15:16] uh worldwide in the past 40 or 60 years
[15:19] it's still very bad of course because of
[15:21] Fiat and the whole system and um saving
[15:25] in Swiss Franks doesn't make sense but
[15:28] it's still uh better than with any other
[15:31] uh fiat currency in the world so uh I
[15:34] think there are some some um some good
[15:38] there's a good environment to understand
[15:40] uh the importance of Bitcoin also
[15:42] because we appreciate the centralized
[15:45] political structures so um so the
[15:49] decentral aspect of Bitcoin is very
[15:51] interesting for us and uh because withs
[15:54] citizens uh vote on policy issues they
[15:57] are trained they're being trained every
[16:00] year to think critically to also uh make
[16:04] up their own mind not just blindly trust
[16:07] the government on an issue but also to
[16:10] think for themselves to decide for
[16:12] themselves whether do they think a
[16:14] certain policy direction is a good idea
[16:17] and you can also see this for example
[16:19] with the covid vaccination so 30% of the
[16:22] Swiss population remained unmaxed uh
[16:25] which is a much higher number than in
[16:28] most other Western countries uh although
[16:31] there has also been a high pressure here
[16:33] but uh people are more just more
[16:35] skeptical more thinking for themselves
[16:37] for example I myself I said I looked at
[16:40] fiser I looked at them paying fines
[16:43] billions of fines uh for malpractice for
[16:47] being responsible for killing uh
[16:49] hundreds of thousands of people in the
[16:51] past decades and then I did my I did my
[16:54] own research as is common in the Bitcoin
[16:57] Community then I decided I I'm not
[16:59] getting waxed I don't trust them I know
[17:02] there's safe very safe alternatives to
[17:05] protect myself from a severe corid
[17:07] infection so this is maybe a bit more
[17:10] the the mindset that is I mean more more
[17:13] prevalent in Switzerland also and which
[17:16] uh then aligns also more to the
[17:18] bitcoiners
[17:19] mindset do you think uh the Swiss will
[17:22] be one of the fastest countries to
[17:25] actually adopt kind of a Bitcoin
[17:27] standard do you think Swiss frank will
[17:29] always be there in the in the Swiss
[17:32] frank political in the Swiss political
[17:34] system do you see like a maybe like
[17:37] coming back like 990 like the coming off
[17:40] the gold standard maybe at some point
[17:41] they will come on a Bitcoin standard
[17:43] where they're like Central Bank of Swiss
[17:45] is like we are backing our currency with
[17:48] with Bitcoin do you see something
[17:49] happening in like the next 10 20 30
[17:52] years in the Swiss um well not only in
[17:54] Switzerland but almost in every country
[17:57] so I would be surprised Ur rised if in
[18:00] the next 10
[18:01] years if most governments or central
[18:05] banks don't have a small Bitcoin
[18:08] allocation um I would be surprised and
[18:11] of course I hope that Switzerland would
[18:13] be one of the first countries I think El
[18:17] Salvador is doing a tremendous job uh we
[18:19] just learned recently that they hold
[18:22] more than about twice as much as Bitcoin
[18:25] as people thought they were holding so
[18:28] uh president
[18:29] najib buuk has really been stacking hard
[18:31] for his country and I think he will make
[18:34] El Salvador first world country within
[18:37] five to 10 years uh because of that
[18:39] strategy um and then I think it's it's
[18:42] one of the most important geopolitical
[18:46] questions of the decade um who which
[18:49] countries are the first movers with AIT
[18:52] with Bitcoin adoption um because I don't
[18:55] want it to be China I don't want it to
[18:58] be Putin and I don't want it to be the
[19:00] Arab oil
[19:02] shakes uh I want it to be Freedom loving
[19:06] countries stable democracies and of
[19:09] course also third world countries that
[19:11] want to get ahead uh that make the first
[19:14] move uh
[19:16] because uh whoever whoever like is the
[19:19] the first adopter this country will
[19:21] these countries will have a tremendous
[19:23] Advantage so right now I'm I'm actually
[19:25] quite happy uh El Salvador is a
[19:27] wonderful example I'm very very happy
[19:30] for Al Salvador that they they are the
[19:32] first I'm also happy for Bhutan that
[19:35] another small country that um just sees
[19:38] the potential of Bitcoin mining um Oman
[19:42] is also okay but maybe if Saudi Arabia
[19:46] uh was next then uh that's maybe not so
[19:49] good for I mean because just of the
[19:51] human rights record so uh that's what I
[19:54] try to communicate in politics also with
[19:56] the Bitcoin strategy I'm proposing for C
[19:58] on be and I I tried to tell people look
[20:02] um Bitcoin is such a great technology uh
[20:05] you cannot stop it anymore it uh it's
[20:08] just you cannot fight it you cannot even
[20:10] fight it not even the Communist Party of
[20:12] China can really fight it so the next uh
[20:15] option the next smart option if you
[20:17] cannot fight it as a government is is to
[20:19] adopt it so uh and then then we're
[20:21] really in a race win a race about which
[20:25] country um makes the first move and uh
[20:28] the president of the Swiss Central Bank
[20:32] uh Thomas Jordan he said well if we
[20:35] decide that we need Bitcoin on the
[20:36] balance sheet we would we have like
[20:39] things are in place we could move
[20:40] quickly uh he already said like one and
[20:42] a half years ago or so so I do hope that
[20:45] the Swiss National Bank they um they
[20:48] study Bitcoin I hope they do um and I
[20:52] hope they they will be I cannot I cannot
[20:56] cannot expect them to be like to be like
[20:59] El Salvador and to belong to the first
[21:01] 5% but I hope that once it catches on
[21:05] that there will be nevertheless not
[21:08] lagging behind too
[21:10] much and um you talked about a proposal
[21:15] um is there something uh maybe like
[21:18] another ankle if you assume total
[21:20] control of the world and you would be
[21:22] like what what things should politicians
[21:26] do uh for Bitcoin what could we
[21:29] Implement as Swiss as Europe as um the
[21:32] world uh to drive the Bitcoin adoption
[21:35] forward what would you do as um as a
[21:38] state what you what would you do as like
[21:40] an political force to for
[21:43] Bitcoin so Bitcoin doesn't need
[21:46] politics um it will people will out of
[21:51] their own free will more more people
[21:53] will opt out of the Fiat system and go
[21:57] into the Bitcoin standard living some
[22:00] will live on the Bitcoin standard like I
[22:02] do I hold almost zero Fiat almost Z zero
[22:06] fat uh I even use a Bitcoin debit card
[22:10] to like do my most of my everyday
[22:13] purchases in order for me to be able to
[22:16] almost not touch fat anymore just little
[22:19] this so just became my lifestyle once I
[22:22] realized how how problematic the Fiat
[22:25] system is I said I want us a lifestyle
[22:28] to have as little to do with Fiat as
[22:31] possible um and now with so I said but
[22:36] Bitcoin Bitcoin doesn't need politics uh
[22:39] that's I think important to realize but
[22:41] it is uh politicians it's uh nation
[22:44] states it's provinces it's
[22:47] municipalities that need Bitcoin to get
[22:50] ahead so every every nation state every
[22:55] um government that lacks behind they
[22:58] it will be more difficult for them uh
[23:01] fiscally uh um but of course there's
[23:03] also the debate within the Bitcoin
[23:05] community that says well Bitcoin should
[23:07] be purely bottom up and governments
[23:10] should just stay stay away which I can
[23:14] understand but um just because of Game
[23:18] Theory it's we know that they won't stay
[23:21] away so um I want the the best countries
[23:24] the the countries with the best
[23:26] governments uh with the those that are
[23:29] most Freedom promoting that have uh the
[23:32] best democracy I want these governments
[23:34] to to be first um and not not the uh
[23:38] dictators of the world and those that
[23:41] abuse human rights and uh do all kinds
[23:44] of evil stuff so I think that's
[23:46] important to realize even for bitcoiners
[23:48] who who are maybe anarco capitalists or
[23:52] very libertarian um to realize well um
[23:57] it's do you want China to be the first
[24:00] or one of the first and then to control
[24:03] the world uh like you don't want that so
[24:06] it's better to to help your where you
[24:10] live if it's a decent government more or
[24:12] less a decent government help them to
[24:14] understand Bitcoin and to belong to the
[24:16] first movers 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only
[24:20] from day one and they teach and preach
[24:23] self- custody this is my goto exchange
[24:26] when someone asks me oh Where Can I buy
[24:28] my Bitcoin from this is the easiest
[24:31] entry for bitcoiners and if you want
[24:34] lower fees Plus at the same time support
[24:37] this podcast use code Robin and click
[24:39] the link in the description yeah this is
[24:42] extremely beautiful because bitcoiners
[24:45] are I never met a Bitcoin that this
[24:48] description does not fit him bitcoiners
[24:50] are really Freedom loving and uh for the
[24:54] game theory for countries uh how can
[24:57] they benefit from it they can benefit
[24:59] from two ways from the first is like um
[25:02] Drive uh Bitcoin to the balance sheets
[25:05] like just adopt Bitcoin uh do Bitcoin
[25:08] things in their country but the second
[25:09] thing is Drive
[25:11] Bitcoins uh to their country like
[25:14] attract bitcoiners from all over the
[25:16] world to live in their countries and
[25:19] this is where game theory is coming in
[25:21] to uh attract Freedom loving people you
[25:24] have to have a freedom loving country
[25:26] and I hope in in that regards and that
[25:29] change over the next decades coming I
[25:33] hope that the whole world gets a little
[25:35] bit more freedom loving a little bit
[25:37] more than direct democra a little bit
[25:40] more in that direction that I think
[25:42] Swiss actually is uh uh and swiss is
[25:45] actually one of the role models uh in
[25:48] the world when we look at how we can
[25:50] structure politic politics and I hope we
[25:53] can just move there a little bit more so
[25:57] um my question to you would be now how
[25:59] can countries like Swiss uh try to
[26:03] attract more bitcoiners how can they uh
[26:07] uh gain the trust of of bitcoiners and
[26:10] and get people to like move
[26:13] there I mean we we can look at what El
[26:16] Salvador is doing uh because they are
[26:19] attracting Bitcoins they're attracting
[26:21] very intelligence intelligent
[26:25] entrepreneurial Minds with lots of
[26:27] capital
[26:28] that will be even worth much more in the
[26:30] next 5 to 10 years uh so it's really an
[26:34] unbelievable job that uh El Salvador is
[26:37] really doing uh I mean the countes I I
[26:41] really want to visit soon I haven't been
[26:43] there just from what I I'm hearing it's
[26:46] transforming and at a very rapid Pace in
[26:48] a very good direction which is very
[26:51] seldom um so I guess we basically need
[26:53] to be doing what they're doing looking I
[26:55] mean Switzerland's already very peaceful
[26:58] so so um so I think that's that's an
[27:00] important thing that people can feel
[27:02] safe that uh also because of our
[27:05] political stability uh we also have a
[27:08] very very high degree of protection of
[27:11] uh property rights and of um individual
[27:14] freedoms uh just excluding the co time
[27:17] but in general I would
[27:19] say um yeah so so I think those are
[27:23] really important factors and then of
[27:25] course you can um do things like in
[27:29] Lugano that you can pay taxes with
[27:31] Bitcoin or uh fees at the municipal
[27:34] level or in counton suuk you can also
[27:36] pay taxes with Bitcoin uh that's
[27:38] actually one of my proposals or what I
[27:40] also propose is that state employees can
[27:43] receive their salaries in Bitcoin which
[27:45] um just will help to foster a Bitcoin
[27:48] circular economy uh the third proposal I
[27:52] made is I asked the government for a
[27:54] report on the potential of Bitcoin
[27:56] mining to stabil I our energy grids and
[28:00] also to use uh wasted energy and the
[28:03] fourth proposal I made is for the Canton
[28:06] uh and its pension fund to DCA into
[28:08] Bitcoin uh so those are the four ideas
[28:11] that I just submitted two days ago uh
[28:13] which I hope uh will would help to like
[28:17] if the if we bring it through in
[28:19] Parliament if we find a majority I hope
[28:21] that this will uh attract bitcoiners to
[28:24] Kon ban and uh and to
[28:26] Switzerland um and and I mean we see
[28:29] bitcoiners are very um rewarding if they
[28:32] see a country is really having a solid
[28:34] Bitcoin strategy they really appreciate
[28:37] that because they know um this is also
[28:40] important for I mean Bitcoin adoption
[28:42] will happen anyway but I believe it's
[28:44] also good to um to help to um accelerate
[28:49] it because we want to get rid of the
[28:51] Fiat system right and also uh to just
[28:54] Foster good education and that people
[28:57] are not being scammed by shitcoins or
[28:59] just by uh not serious Brokers or these
[29:03] kind of websites so I think there a lot
[29:06] of things that uh uh politicians could
[29:09] do to really make their region or their
[29:11] country attractive for for bitcoiners uh
[29:14] which and of course also a reasonable
[29:16] tax rate is also
[29:18] important uh so that you don't feel you
[29:21] just have to give half of you what you
[29:22] earn or half of you what whatever you
[29:25] saved to to some government who that is
[29:27] just wasting wasting your
[29:30] money yeah is so important and uh which
[29:34] what is also interesting for me is um
[29:37] you had a politic political career
[29:40] before Bitcoin
[29:42] right I was I mean I was active uh in
[29:46] politics since 2003 so more than half of
[29:49] my life and I got elected into the
[29:53] parliament in
[29:54] 2017 at that point I just bought my
[29:59] first Bitcoin for like
[30:01] $800 and I sold it one month later for
[30:05] $1,400 so I had very very little
[30:08] understanding of Bitcoin at that time
[30:11] but I was sort of just doing my first
[30:13] baby steps um yeah but I was aware of
[30:17] Bitcoin when I was elected how did uh
[30:21] then adopting Bitcoin while you have an
[30:24] ongoing political career did this
[30:26] influence uh um your career in the
[30:29] political sphere did
[30:31] this was this beneficial to you was this
[30:35] a disadvantage to you how did everybody
[30:37] in your political um scene react to
[30:42] that um I think many many people around
[30:46] me they um cons consider me to be a some
[30:52] bit of a weirdo
[30:53] maybe um but they many still have some
[30:57] respect
[30:58] um
[30:59] so I even got invited by someone from uh
[31:04] from another political party uh to talk
[31:08] at his Banks board meeting about Bitcoin
[31:11] and they invited me like as the
[31:15] unconventional guy uh but they were very
[31:18] interested and willing to listen to me I
[31:21] don't know if they reacted upon
[31:23] everything I said or maybe they will do
[31:25] two years later now um
[31:28] so so I think a lot of people sort of
[31:32] still think it's a bit weird what I'm
[31:34] doing with
[31:35] Bitcoin uh but they also many also
[31:38] accept that I am quite knowledgeable
[31:40] about it they see it I'm about to
[31:42] publish my first book it will be a
[31:44] introductory book to to bitcoin based on
[31:47] uh webinars I've been doing once a month
[31:50] for the past two and a half years just
[31:52] uh free webinars for anyone who was
[31:54] willing to listen to um explain Bitcoin
[31:58] to them for yeah for people who who had
[32:00] little knowledge beforehand yeah but I
[32:03] mean the Bitcoin Community has been very
[32:05] supportive uh it's of course not huge
[32:08] yet so I don't think that right now I'm
[32:11] politically gaining a lot from it uh but
[32:14] I'm not someone who who does things for
[32:17] political gain I have very strong
[32:20] convictions and I stand for them and
[32:22] then I say well whoever wants to let
[32:24] them follow me and whoever does not want
[32:26] to that's okay
[32:29] um but I believe that in the future it
[32:31] will be very B beneficial for me uh
[32:34] because Bitcoin will will adoption will
[32:37] grow and uh because I've been rather
[32:40] early or one actually one of the first
[32:43] politicians almost in Europe to publicly
[32:47] be like really Pro
[32:49] Bitcoin um I think it will benefit me in
[32:52] the long term but at the beginning it's
[32:55] more perhaps more people that don't
[32:57] understand understand me but that's okay
[32:59] um I I just came at the point in
[33:02] 2021 I was at the point where my
[33:04] conviction was so high when I did really
[33:06] did had done a lot of research that I
[33:09] said well I don't just want to Stack
[33:11] thats and be secretive about it I mean
[33:14] many PE many bitcoiners do it I
[33:17] understand why because of privacy and so
[33:19] on uh but I said like um I also want
[33:23] that my friends know about it my family
[33:25] knows about it my voters know about
[33:27] about it so not that one day I I'm just
[33:31] successful because of Bitcoin and people
[33:33] say oh why didn't you tell us about it
[33:35] so I want to um yeah I mean as a as a
[33:39] convinced Christian I'm also uh it's on
[33:42] my heart to share the good news about
[33:43] Jesus Christ so when I discover
[33:46] something that I'm really convinced of
[33:48] that I totally believe in uh I want
[33:51] others to be able to to know what what I
[33:54] believe and also to to discover it and
[33:56] so that's what I also do with
[33:59] Bitcoin yeah it's an amazing and I think
[34:02] long term it will be so beneficial to
[34:05] everybody that is standing up for
[34:07] Bitcoin uh in whatever shape and form
[34:10] that is like if you're just creating
[34:11] content online if you're a politician if
[34:13] you're publicly traded CEO and just
[34:16] adopting Bitcoin and talking about it
[34:18] like Michael sailor like there are so
[34:20] many Avenues you can go through and you
[34:21] don't have to change your life you don't
[34:23] have to work in Bitcoin to be a
[34:25] bitcoiner you can just do whatever you
[34:27] want and love and you are already doing
[34:30] and just see how you can drive Bitcoin
[34:33] adoption or just orange build people
[34:34] around you uh and I think this just just
[34:38] from a egotistical standpoint of view I
[34:41] think this will benefit you greatly but
[34:43] the amazing thing is that bitcoiners
[34:45] don't do it for that reason but I still
[34:48] think it's really beneficial for you
[34:49] long term so I'm always interested uh
[34:52] especially if someone is uh doing
[34:54] something and then in their career they
[34:56] adopted Bitcoin how this this changes
[34:58] something and for people that also it
[35:01] Chang sometimes even their the few of of
[35:04] the world um and for my next question
[35:07] actually you you teaser it uh you um
[35:10] Christian and I had I think two podcast
[35:13] episodes before I talked with Pastor
[35:15] coin like with with
[35:18] the the offer of the Bible and Bitcoin I
[35:21] think it's grp called Uh and I'm
[35:24] fascinated how often this topic comes
[35:28] on my podcast I did not realize it
[35:30] before I was starting the podcast but
[35:32] religion and Bitcoin comes up a lot and
[35:36] of course then there like the haters
[35:37] that don't understand Bitcoin they say
[35:39] Bitcoin is a
[35:40] religion but we can even make an
[35:43] argument that it is but it's not a bad
[35:45] thing um how do you see the connection
[35:48] between U Bitcoin the Bible uh Jesus
[35:52] Christ religion in general um and having
[35:56] faith in and something bigger than
[36:00] yourself uh yeah I also love to talk
[36:02] about this because there are a lot of
[36:04] Parallels for me Bitcoin is clearly not
[36:06] a religion but I mean uh for some people
[36:10] let's say if there are people that that
[36:12] don't believe in God um I understand
[36:14] when with Bitcoin they find something
[36:17] that they feel is like a higher purpose
[36:19] for they find almost like a purpose in
[36:22] their life I I understand it for me
[36:24] Bitcoin is not the purpose for my life
[36:26] it's a great tool I believe that it's
[36:29] divinely inspired and I'm thankful for
[36:31] it there's another book called thank God
[36:34] for Bitcoin it's also a quote by US
[36:37] senator um cyia cyia lamus uh that said
[36:41] that but uh so for me Bitcoin is not the
[36:44] end goal it's it's a tool to bring more
[36:47] freedom to to people and I really
[36:50] appreciate that tool I'm thankful for it
[36:52] uh I want to educate people about it but
[36:55] I believe as a Christian that there's
[36:57] eternity there's heaven and also that
[37:00] there's hell and people need to make a
[37:03] decision um and they uh to be like uh
[37:07] and that there's actually a truth that
[37:09] matters so um and that I find that in
[37:12] the Bitcoin Community it's like uh I
[37:16] mean we know all the toxics toxic
[37:18] maximalists uh I I wouldn't say I'm I'm
[37:21] toxic I I would just say I'm a Bitcoin
[37:23] maximalist uh so we we as maximist
[37:26] maximalists we say is this like one
[37:29] single coin right this the the one truth
[37:31] coin and uh which leads to those goals
[37:35] like freed economic freedom and
[37:37] separation of money and state and this
[37:40] decentralized system um and we know that
[37:43] all the others are shitcoins because of
[37:46] the way they came into existence and
[37:48] pre-mine and the because they're not
[37:50] secure because they're not decentralized
[37:53] because they're just scam coins so what
[37:55] I find with the Bitcoin Community is
[37:57] like this conviction that there's
[37:59] something like absolute truth uh which
[38:02] is worth fighting for and standing for
[38:04] and I also believe that as a Christian
[38:06] in the end there's one absolute reality
[38:08] and I've been sort of annoyed by this um
[38:13] post post materialism uh thinking well
[38:16] just believe whatever you want uh just
[38:20] as long as you're happy with it uh
[38:22] that's okay I mean I I respect of course
[38:25] every opinion but but in the end I
[38:27] believe there's there's a reality there
[38:30] are certain um there are certain laws in
[38:33] physics and Mathematics which Bitcoin is
[38:35] based upon and I believe there Al there
[38:38] are also certain spiritual laws uh that
[38:41] whether you believe them or not they
[38:44] they actually have an influence on your
[38:45] life uh and so I believe it's important
[38:48] to really debate debate these things and
[38:50] to find out what what is the truth what
[38:53] is what is really reality and uh I and
[38:57] that I I just love being among amongst
[38:59] the Bitcoin Community because they're
[39:01] they're intelligent they're going
[39:03] against mainstream they they are
[39:05] thinking for themselves they they uh
[39:08] they are hopeful uh and I think that's
[39:11] really something that's really important
[39:13] to have a community that is hopeful
[39:14] amongst all the bad things that is that
[39:17] are happening in the world um yeah and
[39:21] uh I love to also just talk about these
[39:24] these parallels and of course uh because
[39:27] bit is such a meaningful uh
[39:31] Innovation uh I mean you see like people
[39:34] um referring to Satoshi Nakamoto it's
[39:37] like uh almost like a for some like a
[39:40] messiah figure that brought that sort of
[39:44] uh I mean what Bitcoin achieved is to
[39:47] remove the sinful nature of mankind from
[39:50] the financial system of course you can
[39:52] still do bad things with Bitcoin but the
[39:55] system itself because it's based on
[39:57] rules and not
[39:59] rulers um actually what satosi nakot
[40:02] achieved was to remove that sinful
[40:05] aspect of humans that the corruption the
[40:09] corruption uh that comes uh with humans
[40:13] making decisions within the financial
[40:15] system or the fat Financial system
[40:17] satosi was able to remove that uh and so
[40:21] it's
[40:22] like uh in part it's uh it's a reverse
[40:27] or it's just um just making the
[40:30] financial system less prone to the
[40:32] sinful nature of mankind which of course
[40:35] then is in a way it's a parallel to
[40:38] Jesus Christ who came to this world to
[40:40] die for the sins of of men and to
[40:44] restore uh the the relationship to God
[40:48] uh by by paying with his death for for
[40:51] the sin of
[40:52] mankind and this leads you me also to my
[40:54] next question because Bitcoin as you
[40:56] said is just a tool and I'm also one of
[40:59] the Believers that Bitcoin in the end of
[41:01] the day it's just money uh but it's such
[41:05] a revolutionizing way of thinking of
[41:07] money that when people because of number
[41:10] go up technology discover this topic all
[41:13] of the sudden they discover a new way of
[41:15] thinking it's not that people and not
[41:19] that Bitcoin directly changes minds but
[41:22] it leads you down a path leads you down
[41:25] a research path that actually changes B
[41:29] bitcoin's life and I had I think my
[41:32] third guest it was on who said Bitcoin
[41:34] is a system based on love because it's a
[41:37] system that is uh true like as you said
[41:40] it's it's it's it's it's total truth
[41:42] because you cannot manipulate it like
[41:44] there's the 21 million Bitcoin once you
[41:46] made a transaction you made it you
[41:48] cannot reverse it you cannot call
[41:49] someone oh I made the wrong thing and
[41:52] can you reverse it like it's just truth
[41:54] and with truth there comes consequences
[41:56] and self resp responsibilities and
[41:58] that's an amazing thing to have so now
[42:02] the my next question would be if it's
[42:04] just money but it also has this
[42:06] implications on people how do you see uh
[42:09] or do you see Bitcoin changing Society
[42:13] Long Term when we think of like 50 100
[42:16] years where we live on some money
[42:19] standard again with with Bitcoin do you
[42:21] see changes happening on a society broad
[42:25] level I think the changes will be very
[42:28] big and affecting a lot of aspects of
[42:32] society uh what we can really observe
[42:34] when we look when you go to the Bitcoin
[42:36] conferences to the meetups talking to
[42:39] people who really have a deeper
[42:41] understanding of Bitcoin you find the
[42:43] whole time preference thing which is a
[42:45] very very important concept just I mean
[42:48] you there are people who have been just
[42:51] feeling no sense in life and parting one
[42:55] weekend to the others spending uh insane
[42:58] amount of Fiat money on alcohol for
[43:00] example and then they discover Bitcoin
[43:03] and they suddenly think start thinking
[43:05] in Generations I mean not suddenly but
[43:07] with time and they think about building
[43:09] a family having children in uh like that
[43:13] their children will one day inherit part
[43:15] of their Bitcoin stack and and suddenly
[43:18] they think in decades while before they
[43:20] were only thinking from one weekend to
[43:22] the next uh I think it's something
[43:25] beautiful to see uh it's also Al
[43:27] something that as a as a committed
[43:30] Christian you also um think of the
[43:32] afterlife of Eternity and you try to
[43:35] live a life uh with values that um that
[43:39] is aligned with um with this this
[43:42] long-term thinking uh and so this this
[43:45] aspect of thinking long term is also one
[43:47] of the one of these parallels I see
[43:49] between faith and and Bitcoin and which
[43:52] both both very much promote uh and so
[43:55] thinking longterm I I think will have a
[43:58] tremendous positive impacts on on most
[44:01] areas of society and also just by the
[44:03] incentives that a Bitcoin standard would
[44:07] set um to to Really um yeah think well
[44:11] about before spending uh not going too
[44:14] much into debt um yeah and having a a
[44:19] sound monetary base that is not robbing
[44:21] people of their savings uh it's just
[44:24] something
[44:26] beautiful yeah and I just saw now that
[44:29] you also have the t-shirt on freedom go
[44:31] up like the horse guess it's play on the
[44:34] Trojan Horse of the number gr technology
[44:37] and there's a freedom gr technology I
[44:40] think that's that's wonderful I just
[44:42] discovered it now that I looked at your
[44:44] T-shirt I love it and and we have an end
[44:48] routine in the podcast where the
[44:50] previous guest is asking question for
[44:53] the next guest without knowing who is
[44:55] the next guest actually uh and your
[44:58] question and it's an an interesting one
[45:01] uh imagine like when Bitcoin fails what
[45:05] would you do then or what would that
[45:08] mean for you
[45:10] personally oh it's a question I I had to
[45:13] ask myself in 2021 when I decided to
[45:17] really go publicly as a politician on
[45:20] bitcoin uh knowing if it fails then I
[45:23] mean I keep most of my life savings in
[45:26] Bitcoin
[45:27] um I I've orange pilled several hundred
[45:30] people mostly friends uh family uh
[45:34] colleagues people who are willing to
[45:36] listen to me so people who are maybe
[45:39] politically closer to me because they
[45:41] were more willing to listen to me while
[45:43] people who don't don't like me because
[45:44] of my political viewpoints They al most
[45:48] of them also don't listen to me when I
[45:50] talk about Bitcoin they cannot accept
[45:52] what I
[45:53] say uh and so by now I think think not
[45:57] only my personal finances but also my
[46:00] political career sort of hangs on on me
[46:03] not being wrong about Bitcoin and it not
[46:06] failing which of course is there's no
[46:09] 100% security so um but at some point I
[46:14] just said well not doing it is also a
[46:17] risk so there are no there there's no
[46:20] risk-free life so you just have to
[46:22] decide which risk you want to take and
[46:24] so if Bitcoin would fail that would
[46:27] might mean the end of my political
[46:30] career uh maybe because it could hurt me
[46:34] uh so much that people would not reelect
[46:37] me during the next elections I would
[46:39] personally
[46:40] be quite
[46:42] broke uh and perhaps uh some friends and
[46:46] family would be a bit angry at oh I mean
[46:50] they would understand perhaps that um I
[46:53] couldn't have seen it coming maybe
[46:54] because I tried to really look at all
[46:57] the risks that there are um but of
[47:00] course it would be a very in a way
[47:02] challenging situation but um but at the
[47:06] end Bitcoin is not the the meaning of my
[47:09] life that's Jesus Christ and that's my
[47:11] faith which is for me much more
[47:14] important and so will always be like the
[47:16] foundation of my life so even if Bitcoin
[47:19] fails um I I still would have hope in my
[47:22] life and uh because my hope ultimately
[47:25] is in God and not in Bitcoin although I
[47:28] really appreciate all the good things
[47:30] Bitcoin can bring about uh and so yeah I
[47:34] would continue my life with uh and I
[47:37] would do try to work for justice and
[47:41] love people and yeah do good so I would
[47:45] continue to do that but of course I it
[47:48] would be a severe setback and there are
[47:51] two really interesting things in there
[47:52] like first of all like put your money
[47:53] very myice yeah like you talking about
[47:55] Bitcoin but you also
[48:57] I I actually like to talk about fulltime
[48:58] in Bitcoin but then I also have to put
[49:01] my money away in my office I cannot have
[49:03] 50 50 between Tesla and and Bitcoin if I
[49:06] only talk about Bitcoin then I have to
[49:08] have everything in Bitcoin this is my
[49:11] bet this is what I do I mean I'm also
[49:13] quite young 25 like if I lose everything
[49:15] next year I'm every 26 years old is with
[49:19] with
[49:20] nothing uh basically and uh the second
[49:24] part is and this is an an amazing part
[49:26] because so many people now are totally
[49:30] in Bitcoin and they are willing to
[49:32] defend it uh to an extreme extent so
[49:36] like you me and there are hundreds and
[49:39] thousands of millions of other people
[49:40] that are in Bitcoin like big people like
[49:43] Michael sailor even like if Bitcoin
[49:45] fails it would be tremendous for him
[49:48] like if Bitcoin goes to zero tomorrow
[49:50] that would be like bankrupting a micro
[49:52] strategy basically I think uh and so I
[49:57] think uh um this this this is the the
[50:01] the guard of of Bitcoin a little bit
[50:03] like all the humans that are believing
[50:05] in it and and getting stronger and
[50:07] bigger uh it's like the I think Michael
[50:10] actually talks a lot about this this
[50:11] cyber Hornet that is willing to defend
[50:13] the network at all cost and this is also
[50:16] something that that that when people say
[50:19] like but nobody's guarding Bitcoin yes
[50:21] there are people that are guarding
[50:23] Bitcoin and I think 2017 with the block
[50:25] size Wars this is something where we
[50:27] truly see have seen the the power of the
[50:31] Bitcoin community and the strengths and
[50:33] the actual decentralization of it so
[50:36] yeah like really cool stuff you just
[50:38] said yeah let me maybe add quick
[50:41] parallel uh to that that just came to my
[50:43] mind also back to uh the question of
[50:46] Faith
[50:48] um when we look at uh the the 12
[50:51] Apostles of Jesus Christ the early
[50:53] church um I mean they they said they saw
[50:57] Jesus rise from the dead they say they
[51:00] encountered him after he was crucified
[51:02] and then they spread the message about
[51:05] Jesus Christ in all of the world so and
[51:08] they were willing to die for for these
[51:11] claims and 11 of the 12 apostles
[51:14] actually suffered a very very cruel
[51:16] death they were tortured to death like
[51:19] 11 of 12 of them uh but if they so that
[51:23] shows to me that they were convinced uh
[51:26] that what they were talking about is the
[51:28] truth otherwise I don't think they would
[51:30] have been willing to die uh for that and
[51:33] uh I believe that's one of the reasons
[51:35] why uh Christianity is the largest faith
[51:37] in the world right now because there
[51:39] have been so many people who I mean of
[51:42] course have been bad examples throughout
[51:44] history with the Crusades but hundreds
[51:46] of millions of Christians have decided
[51:49] that they're willing to die for for
[51:51] their convictions uh because they they
[51:54] have such a strong faith and belief that
[51:57] what they believe in is the truth and uh
[52:00] this is what makes uh made Christianity
[52:02] actually very very influential in the
[52:04] world that you had these uh people the
[52:07] martyrs who said I'm not going to kill
[52:10] anyone because of my faith but if I'm
[52:13] being put like the question is being put
[52:15] to me do you want to deny Christ or or
[52:18] live then I'm willing to to die for my
[52:21] faith and uh the price that people pay
[52:25] will uh will show what what their
[52:27] conviction is and uh perhaps with
[52:30] Bitcoin maybe there are not too many
[52:32] who' say I'm willing to lay down my life
[52:34] I mean Jack MERS says he is he said I
[52:37] will die on this hill so there are some
[52:40] uh but even even having even putting
[52:43] your your life savings in Bitcoin is a
[52:45] very very strong statement to say uh I'm
[52:48] really backing this up uh with my
[52:51] actions and if this fails then then yeah
[52:54] I'm really taking taking a hit
[52:57] and uh and it is this this kind of
[53:00] behavior uh that really also strengthens
[53:03] uh yeah the Bitcoin
[53:05] Network yeah totally and it's I think
[53:08] this is a great way to end the podcast a
[53:10] great uh way to to conclud the the
[53:13] podcast thank you Sam for for talking
[53:15] with me for being on the show being uh
[53:18] here as a Bitcoin educator and bringing

[53:30] question about you that want to be
