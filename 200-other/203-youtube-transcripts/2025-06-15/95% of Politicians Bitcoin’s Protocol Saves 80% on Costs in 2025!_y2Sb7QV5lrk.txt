[00:00] Bitcoin's amazing, but it takes people.
[00:02] It takes the social network, right? And
[00:04] people love storytelling. That's the
[00:06] easiest way to convey an idea or a
[00:08] thought is through storytelling. The
[00:10] more I see how many different ways like
[00:12] Bitcoin mining can be integrated into
[00:14] our current system, not just for
[00:17] monetary good, but resource allocation,
[00:20] for sustainability practices. I remember
[00:22] watching a video of some guy, some
[00:24] economist saying, "If Bitcoin succeeds,
[00:26] we will all die." Like something that
[00:28] extreme. But now you're starting to see
[00:30] politicians not only be pro- Bitcoin,
[00:32] but who can now elaborate on why Bitcoin
[00:35] is a net positive for society. If you
[00:37] think about all of those properties
[00:39] slowly coming together throughout
[00:40] history, all trying to solve, we finally
[00:42] get to this point of Bitcoin that
[00:44] through its protocol solves all of those
[00:46] problems in one simple single code. I
[00:49] think Bitcoin incentivizes good behavior
[00:51] amongst its participants. And how can
[00:55] not just owning Bitcoin but studying
[00:57] Bitcoin help make us better and treat
[00:59] each other better on the social
[01:01] [Music]
[01:05] layer? What is your kind of your
[01:07] highlight from the last year uh that you
[01:10] have seen? There's a strategic Bitcoin
[01:12] reserve, there's the ETF that came in.
[01:14] Man, there there has been so many
[01:16] things.
[01:17] So, we we uh I have a a Lincolnland
[01:21] Bitcoin meet up here in my uh in my area
[01:25] and we talk about like the top 30 things
[01:28] or what happened in the last 30 days
[01:30] every month and it's just so much. So, I
[01:34] mean the short answer is the fact that
[01:37] there's all this positive news. It it's
[01:40] just from starting in 2018 and going
[01:44] through multiple cycles now just seeing
[01:47] all the positive news because you know
[01:49] back then I when did you start? What
[01:51] year was your first year? Uh my first
[01:54] year was end of 2023. Uh but it was like
[01:58] December so I basically started in 204.
[02:00] Yeah. Yeah. I mean and I mean there's
[02:02] still a good amount of FUD then but just
[02:05] seeing how much everything has just
[02:07] shifted into this you know, Bitcoin is
[02:10] good. You now have companies or not
[02:12] companies, but you now have
[02:14] publications that are generally
[02:16] negatively, you know, anti- Bitcoin now
[02:19] writing positive things about the
[02:21] positive externalities of Bitcoin
[02:23] mining. I mean, just seeing the shift
[02:26] just happen is the Overton window, if
[02:29] you will. I mean, we could go into any
[02:31] one of the things that you mentioned and
[02:33] and plenty more, but just to see it now
[02:36] starting to be a positive. It's
[02:39] like truth only needs, you know, truth
[02:42] is like the light, you know, it just
[02:44] needs a place to be exposed, right? It
[02:47] needs to just see. And uh I'm starting
[02:50] to see that. It's it's super interesting
[02:52] that overtone window. We're talking a
[02:54] lot about that. What what do you mean
[02:57] with
[02:58] overton is shifting? So like I said from
[03:01] 2018 on you know I I was doing a lot of
[03:05] studying and reading a lot of stuff but
[03:07] then at the same time when you saw any
[03:09] Bitcoin talk in the media it was all
[03:11] negative. It was all just like I
[03:14] remember watching a video of some guy
[03:16] some economist saying if Bitcoin
[03:18] succeeds we will all die. like something
[03:20] that extreme, you know? I mean, it is
[03:23] just totally irrational. But now you're
[03:26] starting to see politicians not only be
[03:29] pro Bitcoin, but who can now elaborate
[03:33] on why Bitcoin is a net positive for
[03:37] society. So, you're starting to see a
[03:39] lot of the the seeds that were
[03:41] sewn from like the beginning till now
[03:45] starting to come to fruition. you're
[03:46] starting to see more people not just
[03:49] know what Bitcoin is based off of the
[03:51] ticker on the screen, but can actually
[03:53] elaborate in some way either maybe not
[03:56] how it works, but why it might be good
[03:58] for some people. And you have written
[04:01] the book history echoes Bitcoin. So, so
[04:03] you have seen all those things and
[04:06] probably can give some context what
[04:09] what's currently happening with with
[04:10] Bitcoin from past events that have have
[04:13] happened. what uh for the people that
[04:15] don't know about your book, what what
[04:17] did you kind of write there and what was
[04:18] kind of the thesis around that? The
[04:21] understanding I had right when I the
[04:24] motivation to write it was that I was
[04:27] looking at all of these properties of
[04:29] Bitcoin, decentralization,
[04:31] permissionlessness, immutability, you
[04:33] know, all all the properties. And if you
[04:36] take each one of them as a separate arc
[04:38] throughout history, humanity has been
[04:40] trying to solve for that thing. We've
[04:42] been trying to find ways to have a
[04:44] society where we don't need to ask
[04:46] permission or where we don't have one
[04:49] single gatekeeper for all of the the
[04:51] power or information or you know across
[04:54] the board all of these properties as
[04:56] separate arcs in history. So what I did
[04:59] is I took a bunch of examples from
[05:01] history showing
[05:02] that permissionlessness like Martin
[05:04] Luther uh nailing his thesis to the
[05:07] Catholic Church. Uh he was saying right
[05:10] there that you don't you don't need to
[05:12] tell me how I need to have a conver uh
[05:16] relationship with God, right? I can do
[05:18] that on my own. I don't need your
[05:19] permission to do that.
[05:22] um decentralization. You can talk about
[05:24] the printing press or the internet and
[05:26] how it freed up uh what we've been
[05:29] wanting for the longest time, freeing up
[05:30] information, making it more easily
[05:32] accessible. If you think about all of
[05:34] those
[05:35] properties separately coming slowly
[05:38] coming together throughout history, all
[05:39] trying to solve, we finally get to this
[05:41] point of
[05:42] Bitcoin that through its
[05:45] protocol solves all of those problems in
[05:48] one simple single code. That's the short
[05:50] of it. That's super interesting. What
[05:54] What do you think is the best invention
[05:57] we could compare Bitcoin towards? Like
[06:00] you mentioned the printing press,
[06:01] there's the internet, there's
[06:02] electricity. I I think to me it's it's
[06:05] it's not so much comparing it to one.
[06:09] It's showing how many of them work
[06:12] together. It's like I'm I'm kind of like
[06:16] in the form formalization stage of
[06:19] writing a second book and it's it's
[06:20] going to be on energy um more
[06:23] generally um how energy storage has
[06:28] increased throughout time, how energy
[06:30] transmission has improved throughout
[06:32] time and how just our ability to
[06:35] understand and respect
[06:36] energy has continued to evolve. And if
[06:39] you want to say like what kind of
[06:42] invention, it's like almost many
[06:44] inventions together. Just like Satoshi
[06:46] when he put together Bitcoin, the only
[06:49] things he actually
[06:50] really added like that were his own I
[06:53] believe is the 21 million hard cap and
[06:57] um the difficulty adjustment. literally
[07:00] everything else, all the other aspects
[07:02] of cryptography and blockchain
[07:04] technology or whatever you want to call
[07:05] it, all of those um the 50 years of
[07:08] research leading up to that, he picked
[07:10] and choosed different inventions and put
[07:13] them together. So to me,
[07:17] uh, I mean, you could say the printing
[07:19] press, you could say the internet. I
[07:21] mean, you can even talk about like gold
[07:23] mining, you can put all of these
[07:25] different inventions in there, uh,
[07:27] because they all in some way or another
[07:30] helped better transmit or store energy
[07:36] or just find ways to better respect it.
[07:38] That's very true. and and I'm I'm
[07:42] specifically obsessed currently with the
[07:44] printing press. Um I haven't gone down a
[07:50] deep rabbit hole around the printing
[07:51] press uh previously. Uh and I've started
[07:54] doing that. Yeah. Now it's March like in
[07:57] February probably I've done that and I'm
[07:59] like wow there's so many comparisons to
[08:02] to Bitcoin and and and how how this is.
[08:04] It's it's kind of fascinating that I
[08:06] never looked at it before and there are
[08:08] plenty of articles around that and and
[08:11] stuff like that. I don't know if there's
[08:12] a book around that but probably a lot of
[08:15] mentions in books. I'm sure. Absolutely.
[08:19] That's one of those things that imagine
[08:22] being somebody right before the printing
[08:24] press and just knowing your basic
[08:27] operating procedure. You know this just
[08:30] how I go about my day. If I want to
[08:32] learn something, I got to go to um the
[08:35] church or the, you know, the individual
[08:37] in town who knows how to read, you know,
[08:40] because nobody really needs to know how
[08:42] to read because it's so expensive and
[08:44] it's, you know, it takes a long time and
[08:46] and now we all have that ability. Wow.
[08:51] Who thought of it? You know, it's it
[08:52] it's just a such a paradigm shift just
[08:55] in that one invention. And also the
[08:57] numbers shocked me when you're like okay
[09:00] before the printing press uh in Europe
[09:04] they basically have written that they
[09:07] they they has have to write those those
[09:09] books and it took them a lot of time
[09:12] depending on like what the quality is
[09:14] and and how long from a few months to
[09:16] maybe years to write one book and then
[09:20] uh the Gutenberg Bible I think it was
[09:22] like over a thousand pages 1,200 or
[09:25] something like
[09:26] And the first the numbers I I could be
[09:30] wrong on but I remember 180 uh copies
[09:33] were the the first branch of them. Uh
[09:36] and he took 5 years to do those alone
[09:40] while inventing the printing press. And
[09:42] then like 15 years later in Europe there
[09:45] have already been what was the number 15
[09:48] million or 20 million books or something
[09:50] like that. It's it's crazy how fast this
[09:52] do how fast this exponential growth is.
[09:56] And on a completely different note, I
[09:57] always wondered back then like how much
[09:59] looking at what we've witnessed in the
[10:01] last so many years like how much of that
[10:03] information was like would be considered
[10:05] misinformation or disinformation. Maybe
[10:07] that's a conversation for a different
[10:09] time,
[10:09] but like back then and I guess the point
[10:13] to make on that in regards to Bitcoin is
[10:15] like even though there's the printing
[10:16] press, you still had a very limited
[10:18] number of people pushing out the
[10:20] information that they wanted wanted you
[10:22] to hear. So there was that
[10:26] um some soft form of censorship, you
[10:30] know, like we're going to tell you what
[10:31] we want you to hear. So even though that
[10:34] was an invention, there was still some
[10:37] negative externalities that came from,
[10:39] you know, humans just being fallible. So
[10:41] if you if you fast forward that to
[10:42] Bitcoin, like now it it's simply just a
[10:46] truth machine. it can't be abstracted or
[10:48] the the fallibility as humans is kind of
[10:51] abstracted away in a
[10:54] sense because it's just code. So it has
[10:57] all the benefits of the printing
[11:00] press plus it has that ability to
[11:03] avoid humans being humans like and and
[11:08] there have been uh like you're right
[11:11] because there's still who can afford the
[11:14] printing press and who can afford to go
[11:17] to those print shops that kind of
[11:19] emerged and and print things out and and
[11:22] and do those copies because it still was
[11:25] a way more expensive.
[11:27] process than it is now to spread
[11:29] information. Now it's just like oh here
[11:32] Telegram, WhatsApp, I just send it. Oh,
[11:34] like I I launched a blog on on media.
[11:36] Oh, like here everyone has it and
[11:38] everyone can see it and it's it's free
[11:41] and open source. Now we have AI that
[11:43] just like summarizes a whole book for
[11:44] you and like you get the gist of it. Uh
[11:47] so so the the spread of information is
[11:50] is just on a whole different level. Um,
[11:54] but it was way better. And the thing now
[11:57] with Bitcoin, we are also early stages
[12:00] in Bitcoin. There's still exchanges that
[12:02] can be shut off and on uh and make it
[12:05] very hard for the Bitcoin adoption. Uh
[12:07] there's still the fear rails that are
[12:09] controlled. And maybe that's an
[12:11] interesting comparison. And at some
[12:13] point, you you won't have those
[12:16] restrictions anymore. I already get paid
[12:19] and pay in Bitcoin uh for the podcast.
[12:22] Uh and so a big and bigger income stream
[12:25] and expenses stream basically a money
[12:28] stream is completely not touching fiat
[12:31] anymore. Uh which is an amazing thing uh
[12:34] to to do because then you really notice
[12:37] how strong that independence thing of
[12:40] Bitcoin is. There's no KYC process when
[12:43] I have my metal plate wallet. Right.
[12:48] Right. 100%. Yeah. I'm And I'm I'm
[12:51] moving there as as much as I can in my
[12:54] because I you know I'm in my late 40s
[12:57] and I I came up and have been completely
[13:00] entrenched in that fiat world. And like
[13:03] like we mentioned, you don't even notice
[13:06] um all of those extra controls, all the
[13:10] um lack of
[13:12] sovereignty until you start learning
[13:14] about Bitcoin. And then you start to see
[13:15] it and it's kind of hard to pull pull
[13:17] away from that as you go. you also um uh
[13:20] and I really really like that you're
[13:23] also a teacher uh for for for kids and
[13:28] uh what would you say is the impact that
[13:32] Bitcoin has for the future generation if
[13:35] Bitcoin actually is pursuing and and how
[13:38] different they will will grow up. That's
[13:40] interesting. Um that's that's uh
[13:43] something
[13:44] that will take a long time
[13:47] to to pan out to see what what I hope
[13:52] will happen
[13:54] is we learn we gain a greater sense of
[13:59] low time preference as a society as a
[14:02] whole. I mean, um, not don't know if you
[14:05] spend a lot of time around kids or not,
[14:06] but,
[14:07] um, they are pretty, um, what's the word
[14:11] I'm looking for?
[14:12] Uh, they're quick to act. You know, you
[14:15] know, everything's all shortterm. Um,
[14:18] living in the moment. Living in the
[14:20] moment. And you know what? That's just
[14:21] part of life's journey. But they're
[14:25] also, and I'm generalizing here, um,
[14:29] much of
[14:30] society still has that, you know, once
[14:33] they reach their adult years. So, a lot
[14:35] of these kids have parents who are also
[14:38] living in that, you know, high time pre
[14:40] preference mindset and they're getting
[14:42] those examples. And the more we can not
[14:45] just get Bitcoin into our system, but
[14:47] like teach the fundamentals of Bitcoin,
[14:49] teach the ethos of Bitcoin, teach that
[14:52] whole idea of low time preference. I
[14:54] think that's going to have the biggest
[14:56] effect on our society moving forward.
[14:58] Interesting. You also said uh you're
[15:01] writing a a second book uh around
[15:04] energy.
[15:05] Uh what was what is that about?
[15:09] So, it's not
[15:11] um for those of you guys for those of
[15:14] your listeners who've read like The
[15:16] Price of Tomorrow, you know, uh Jeff
[15:17] Booth's amazing book. Uh it it was not
[15:22] about Bitcoin at all, but it was all
[15:23] about Bitcoin in a way. Like he didn't
[15:26] even mention it till the end, right? I
[15:29] kind of want to come at it from that
[15:30] angle. The audience is is intended to be
[15:33] more the general public who might just
[15:35] be interested in the concept of energy
[15:37] and you know how I the history of energy
[15:42] production and
[15:44] storage and I'll kind of in a similar to
[15:48] history echoes Bitcoin I I plan on
[15:51] discussing like historical events that
[15:53] showed like I mentioned earlier how the
[15:56] storage of energy how the transmission
[15:57] of energy has improved over time and how
[15:59] how Each step brought us closer to and
[16:04] the quote that keeps going through my
[16:05] mind is respecting energy because the
[16:08] more I've studied Bitcoin, the more I
[16:09] just see it as the ultimate respect for
[16:12] energy. like I I you know I get to
[16:17] freelance right uh for like mining
[16:20] companies and um the more I see how many
[16:25] different ways like Bitcoin mining can
[16:27] be integrated into our current system
[16:30] not just for monetary good but resource
[16:34] allocation for sustainability practices.
[16:38] You just see this is just like a very
[16:44] It's it's just so damn logical once you
[16:47] look at it with an objective lens that
[16:51] more people just need to see that this
[16:53] is going to be a positive for society
[16:55] moving forward. So the book is intended
[16:59] to try and get you from this point of
[17:00] like what is energy? Why is it
[17:02] important? Why you know what how has it
[17:05] grown throughout time and then oh by the
[17:06] way here's this Bitcoin that does all
[17:08] that. It stores energy better. you know,
[17:11] Michael Sailor's adabatic uh systems
[17:14] kind of analogy. Uh it transmit energy
[17:18] better because their monetary energy
[17:20] being transmitted is decentralized. It's
[17:24] immutable, censorship resistant, all
[17:26] that. And
[17:28] then through the mining process, how it
[17:31] respects energy is is really the
[17:34] bringing it all together. The bow on the
[17:37] end of it.
[17:38] How is how is
[17:41] the Bitcoin mining and and how is
[17:44] Bitcoin respecting the energies? Is it
[17:46] because like you you you get your
[17:48] financial energy in and then it it's not
[17:51] leaking out as in in other systems and
[17:53] it's actually expanding kind of. So that
[17:55] would to me kind of fit into the um
[17:58] storage. So Bitcoin little B, you know,
[18:00] the asset that's how it's storing the
[18:02] energy. um the Bitcoin big B the network
[18:07] the protocol to me is that
[18:10] transmission of the energy and then the
[18:14] mining the mining to me represents that
[18:17] just the respect thereof.
[18:20] So, I mean, you could uh point to any
[18:23] example of like how it can you can
[18:26] capture flare gas and turn that
[18:30] into monetize that through the the
[18:33] mining process. How like um there's a
[18:36] town in Finland now that uses Bitcoin
[18:39] mining and captures the heat exhaust and
[18:43] pumps it through its district heating
[18:45] and lowers its uh energy bills by 20%.
[18:50] Um, you can talk about how we're now
[18:54] turning methane off of
[18:58] landfills into bit Bitcoin. So, instead
[19:01] of just letting it leak into the
[19:02] atmosphere, we're actually collecting it
[19:03] and we're monetizing it. We're able to
[19:06] clean the
[19:08] environment in a in a, you know,
[19:11] financially appropriate kind of way. You
[19:14] know, it's not just here's some carbon
[19:16] credits and they're the problem solved.
[19:18] It's like actual
[19:20] solutions. There's so many examples of
[19:22] that and and and I can't think of a
[19:25] better term than respecting energy. I
[19:27] love that term. It's like you are
[19:29] respecting the energy that actually goes
[19:33] in, goes out and stays there. And this
[19:37] is kind of the the energy of of of
[19:40] Bitcoin. And you you can put it there. I
[19:42] I love the Bitcoin is energy money, you
[19:45] know, that the you you you
[19:47] you in a way Bitcoin is not not only
[19:51] energy money, it it is kind of energy,
[19:53] financial energy, whatever you want to
[19:55] like to call it.
[19:57] I've um I've been back and forth on
[19:59] that. There's a lot of people who've
[20:01] made um great points that Bitcoin isn't
[20:04] technically energy, and I I get that.
[20:08] I'm not trying to make the case that I'm
[20:10] storing this energy and I'm passing to
[20:12] you and you can use it as energy in the
[20:14] terms of like electricity or whatever.
[20:16] Um so it's more of a artistic
[20:20] representation you know it's more of an
[20:22] analogy but if you think of like the
[20:25] laws of the thermodynamics you got
[20:28] energy is never created nor destroyed
[20:29] it's just transferred. So if you think
[20:32] of it in that terms, the mining, what
[20:35] mining does in addition to securing the
[20:37] network, which is the most important
[20:39] reason it's there, we're talking about
[20:41] like the second order effects. Um, it's
[20:45] converting unused, wasted, stranded
[20:48] energy, right, into monetary energy, if
[20:53] you, if you'll allow that term, which
[20:56] can be then stored in a lossless
[21:00] way and then converted in the future to
[21:03] whatever you know use. In a way, it's a
[21:08] representation. Uh it's a it's a keeping
[21:10] track of keeping a tabs of of of of
[21:13] energy in the most respecting manner
[21:17] because you can plug energy in to
[21:20] Bitcoin and you can actually get Bitcoin
[21:22] out of that but you can actually also
[21:23] pay for electricity in in Bitcoin and
[21:26] get it out of there. So it is an
[21:29] interesting interesting intersection.
[21:30] Yeah, I'm really looking forward to the
[21:32] book of how you come there and and and
[21:34] and what kind of uh differentiation you
[21:37] you make between energy and and and
[21:39] Bitcoin and those things. Thank you. I I
[21:41] I do too. I'm looking forward to that,
[21:44] too. I got it. Yeah. How different is it
[21:47] to write the second book now?
[21:49] It's it's it's easier because now I
[21:52] don't have the whatifs in my head like,
[21:55] you know, how do I do this? How do I do
[21:57] that? I just I have the ideas. I put
[21:59] them on paper and I just keep hashing
[22:01] them out. Um, I will say that second
[22:04] time around I've learned the lesson that
[22:06] I'm not going to self-publish. Um, my
[22:10] strengths are in more of the the writing
[22:12] side of it and less of the publishing
[22:14] side. So, when it does come to fruition,
[22:16] it's going to be done properly.
[22:18] Interesting. So, you're now uh probably
[22:21] partnering up with with some
[22:23] self-publishing is like you you have to
[22:25] do the marketing and everything
[22:26] yourself, right? Right. That's not my
[22:28] strength. You gota you got to know your
[22:30] strengths and know your weaknesses. So
[22:34] yeah, I'm I'm actually uh because for me
[22:37] it uh would would be easier to to have a
[22:40] book uh because I can promote it on
[22:42] every podcast and stuff like that. So it
[22:43] would be actually maybe a good thing. Uh
[22:46] and I discovered that writing is not my
[22:48] strength. uh but uh I actually want to
[22:50] learn it and I think uh I it it's it's
[22:53] something that actually forms my
[22:55] thoughts a lot if I'm writing and you
[22:59] have to dive deeper on topics that you
[23:02] otherwise wouldn't have dove so deep
[23:06] into you know that's just like teaching
[23:10] um the the deepest form of understanding
[23:12] something is if you can teach it back to
[23:13] somebody and that's the exact same
[23:15] process with writing it's just putting
[23:17] your thoughts on page like does this
[23:18] make sense? Does this say what I want it
[23:20] to? Is it as articulate as need to be?
[23:22] And then you keep adding, keep adding,
[23:24] keep adding. And then at some point you
[23:26] have to take away to aid in the
[23:29] comprehension. You put all the thoughts
[23:31] down, all them down, organize them, and
[23:34] then
[23:35] realize, wow, I'm overseeing this. How
[23:38] can I bring it back to an understandable
[23:40] level? What did you learn uh in the and
[23:43] I think we talked a little bit about
[23:44] that in the in the first podcast also if
[23:46] I'm not misting but what did you learn
[23:48] in the writing process on Bitcoin about
[23:51] Bitcoin? Well, still learning because
[23:53] you're writing on the second one. And
[23:55] that's really it is like you got to be
[23:57] humble and realize that you you there's
[24:00] so much you don't the more you learn the
[24:01] more you realize you don't know. So I I
[24:03] I come at
[24:05] it not with like some self-perceived,
[24:08] you know, expert hat because that's not
[24:11] it. It's more of just the curiosity of a
[24:15] child like, "Oh, this is cool. What
[24:17] about this idea? Does are these things
[24:20] connected? And how how are they
[24:22] connected?" Yeah. Um, if you can
[24:24] maintain that that innocence of sorts
[24:28] and just awe of Bitcoin, then I think
[24:33] it'll be wellreceived, but if you come
[24:35] across, not saying you will, but if when
[24:37] you go to write your book, like imagine
[24:40] if you came across and said, I am the
[24:42] number one Bitcoin expert and here's
[24:44] what you need to know, that thing would
[24:46] fall flat on its face,
[24:47] right? Even if it's a 100% accurate, you
[24:50] know? So, I mean, I think that just a
[24:54] little bit of humility, Bitcoin teaches
[24:57] you a little bit more of that, you
[24:59] know. Yeah. I mean, I I anyways uh
[25:03] actually have planned it for more of
[25:06] like, okay, I've done now uh now over
[25:10] 450 episodes. So, when the book comes
[25:12] out, maybe even like a thousand. And and
[25:15] from those, what have I learned? like
[25:17] what what did I take out from all those
[25:20] amazing people? I love that cuz that's a
[25:22] that's the journey and that's what we're
[25:23] all on, right? I mean, Bitcoin's
[25:26] amazing, but it it takes people. It
[25:28] takes the social network, right? And and
[25:32] people love storytelling. That's the
[25:34] easiest way to convey an idea or a
[25:37] thought is through storytelling. And I
[25:38] guess that's kind of why I used like
[25:40] those historical examples because then I
[25:42] don't have to be all technical and the
[25:44] the the audience doesn't have to try and
[25:48] feel like they're learning something new
[25:49] like I have to cram for a test so to
[25:52] speak. But if you can tell it in a
[25:53] story, tell your journey, tell what I've
[25:56] learned along the way and and and be
[25:59] kind of intimate with it, you know, just
[26:02] allow yourself to be vulnerable through
[26:04] that whole process. I think that that's
[26:06] really um what helps convey that that
[26:09] message that that journey.
[26:12] One thing I'm really also interested in
[26:14] is the social revolution. Uh we we
[26:16] talked about Jeff Boo and I I I just had
[26:19] I think like a week ago or so uh a
[26:22] podcast with him uh here here on on here
[26:25] the second round also with him. uh and
[26:27] we talked about that concept of we are
[26:29] Bitcoin and how important the social
[26:32] revolution of Bitcoin
[26:35] is. Do you have from your history
[26:39] knowledge some context to how important
[26:42] the social aspect and the social
[26:44] revolution behind Bitcoin is and how you
[26:48] kind of look at that? It's funny cuz I
[26:51] don't consider myself a historian per
[26:53] se. It's more of a shade tree kind of
[26:55] his historian, you know. Um
[27:01] um more of a pattern recognitionist, if
[27:04] you will.
[27:06] Um pattern rec, you know, that's what
[27:10] they call a conspirac the nice way of
[27:12] calling somebody a conspiracy theorist
[27:13] is a pattern recognitionist. And I'm not
[27:16] a conspiracy theorist. Um, I'll leave
[27:19] that to my dad. But,
[27:21] uh, little shout out there.
[27:25] Um,
[27:27] I, as far as the social revolution,
[27:30] I I tend to see things I I try and zoom
[27:34] out as far as I can to get the big
[27:36] picture, the the gist of of whatever's
[27:39] happening in the moment. And that's the
[27:41] the biggest lesson I can take away. and
[27:43] I try and avoid the minutia of like
[27:46] historical events or whatever. And what
[27:50] I always see is a power struggle. And it
[27:53] always seems like the powerful are using
[27:55] things like censorship um you know to
[28:00] keep the those who aren't in power down,
[28:04] right? So then when you see something
[28:06] like Bitcoin come along and allow
[28:09] literal power to the people, right? it
[28:13] it of course the uh those in power are
[28:16] going to push back against it. They're
[28:19] going to call out all the names in the
[28:21] book, throw all the FUD
[28:23] out, but Bitcoin don't care. I mean, and
[28:27] it's it's a honeybger, right? It's going
[28:28] to continue doing what it's going to do.
[28:30] So, it in terms of history,
[28:34] there's there's very few inventions that
[28:37] have that ability to allow the people
[28:39] the power. And that's kind of why
[28:43] I've I'm not answering your question
[28:45] now, but that's kind of why I've really
[28:47] taken a hold to it fascination for it.
[28:50] Let's take a break for a moment and
[28:52] appreciate the beauty that coin
[28:55] vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[28:57] watches. Those watches are the most
[29:00] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[29:03] that you are a true Bitcoiner. and Coin
[29:06] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[29:09] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[29:12] watch collections. You have the date of
[29:14] the first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[29:18] there and of course also the block
[29:20] height and which epoch we are currently
[29:23] in. I love the level of detail they put
[29:26] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[29:29] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[29:31] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[29:34] love those watches. so so much. And now
[29:37] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[29:40] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[29:42] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[29:44] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[29:46] first way is you put it on a hardware
[29:48] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[29:51] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[29:54] BitBox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[29:57] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[30:00] if you check out the link in the
[30:01] description, you even get 5% off if you
[30:04] use the code Robin. And the second way
[30:07] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[30:10] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[30:13] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[30:16] They will personalize for you a
[30:19] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[30:21] your individual situation. They will
[30:24] show you how you can secure your own
[30:27] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[30:29] enough. You also have to keep all your
[30:31] devices secure. One topic that is
[30:33] overlooked often is the inheritance
[30:36] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[30:39] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[30:41] a plan for that in place already? And
[30:44] last but not least, if you're in a
[30:45] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[30:48] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[30:50] that, head over to the
[30:54] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[30:57] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[31:00] be for the first time ever speaking at
[31:02] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[31:05] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[31:08] really looking forward to seeing all of
[31:10] you there. You can get your ticket in
[31:12] the link down in the description of
[31:15] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[31:17] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[31:21] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[31:22] there. It's also the first revolution
[31:25] that I can remember of that financially
[31:29] rewards
[31:30] you. Usually standing up against the
[31:34] status quo is financially
[31:38] nonrewarding. Usually you you you're
[31:40] fighting against against it. And Bitcoin
[31:44] is
[31:45] for my knowledge, the first revolution
[31:49] where you fight against the status quo
[31:53] and you are financially rewarded for
[31:56] doing so. Not only because you you're
[31:59] doing something for it, but you're
[32:00] actually uh operating on a new standard
[32:03] which expands your financial energy
[32:06] which in is a
[32:08] fascinating marketing for that thing.
[32:12] That's why we don't need marketing
[32:15] uh team. We we don't have a CEO. We we
[32:17] don't need that because Bitcoin is so
[32:19] good that
[32:20] people love it. They get rewarded for it
[32:24] and that's why they are being the
[32:27] marketing team. We have so many
[32:28] different marketing teams in Bitcoin and
[32:30] and on on top of that, you're
[32:33] financially rewarded because you can't
[32:35] that financial gain or whatever. It
[32:38] can't be taken. It can't be confiscated.
[32:39] like we don't only have to go back just
[32:41] a few years to the Canadian truckers
[32:43] protest to see, oh, you disagree with
[32:45] the power structures, guess what? We'll
[32:47] close your bank accounts. It's
[32:50] like, so it's not only the financial
[32:53] rewarding on the upside, it's it's the
[32:55] lack of it being able to be taken away,
[32:57] I think, adds to that as well. That
[32:59] makes it that
[33:00] um it what is the phrase the TB phrase?
[33:04] Anti-fragile. The anti-fragility of it.
[33:07] So yeah, I agree. It is in terms of
[33:12] revolutions. It's one is the phrase uh
[33:15] idea whose time has come. You can't it
[33:17] doesn't seem like it's able to be
[33:18] stopped. And and one of my favorite
[33:21] phrases of all time is good ideas don't
[33:23] require
[33:24] force. I don't have to force anybody.
[33:28] It's permissionless. You know, it's
[33:29] voluntary. You don't have to force
[33:31] anybody to do anything. and it's growing
[33:33] on its own without like subsidies or you
[33:36] know like laws saying that it is the
[33:39] only coin or whatever. Ideas don't
[33:42] require force. They have it. They have
[33:44] the force. It has force. It has force.
[33:47] Right. It is the force.
[33:50] Yeah. That could be a cool quote. Good
[33:53] ideas don't require force. It is the
[33:56] force.
[33:57] And then maybe the force be with you.
[33:59] Something. Add that in there. Exactly.
[34:01] we we we can spend some time there and p
[34:04] put pull out a nice tweet. It's a it's a
[34:07] fascinating topic of of the revolution
[34:09] of of Bitcoin and what it does with our
[34:13] world. Um how has actually Bitcoin
[34:15] influenced uh you personally and and
[34:17] your world? I
[34:19] have grown leaps and bounds um in the
[34:23] last decade or so or better part of a
[34:26] decade. Um, part of it's
[34:29] just getting past middle-aged, you know,
[34:33] mature maturing like life
[34:36] experiences, but the more I learn and
[34:40] specifically about Bitcoin, the more I I
[34:42] I take that on.
[34:44] Like I mentioned earlier, the low time
[34:47] preference, my time preference has
[34:48] shifted dramatically in the last
[34:51] sevenish years, I guess.
[34:54] Um, I'm much more discerning.
[34:58] Like I'm I when I started out in 2018, I
[35:04] had, pardon my language, I had my [ __ ]
[35:06] coining days and they were valuable
[35:09] lessons and I learned them just like
[35:11] everybody else or the people who learned
[35:13] them. you know, there's still people who
[35:15] haven't learned that lesson yet. But,
[35:17] um, I was spending so much of my time
[35:20] trying to understand this, flipped that
[35:22] into this, and then, you know, what is
[35:24] this, and how do I make that work with
[35:25] this? And it was just a waste of time. I
[35:28] wasted a good year and a half, two years
[35:30] of my life up until about
[35:33] 2020 just trying to make a dollar, you
[35:38] know, make more depreciating fiat, so to
[35:40] speak. And um now it's just like, oh,
[35:44] all I got to do is save in Bitcoin and
[35:46] then focus on my craft. So instead of
[35:48] like running continuing to run the rat
[35:50] race, I'm now spending more time able to
[35:53] write. Um I'm I'm a I've been a musician
[35:56] my whole life and I've been a guitarist.
[35:59] You know what? I've always wanted to be
[36:00] better at piano. Now I'm taking time to
[36:01] do piano. Um I'm getting to coach my
[36:04] kids baseball and softball. I'm I'm
[36:06] getting to do all of those things that
[36:09] actually improve my life as opposed to
[36:11] just trying to chase more
[36:14] dollars. So, in that low time preference
[36:17] mindset, I also have that ability. Um, I
[36:19] found Bitcoin has given me that that
[36:23] freedom to increase the quality, not
[36:27] just the quantity of money, but like the
[36:28] quality of life. It's the mental clarity
[36:31] that comes from Bitcoin that you can
[36:33] really focus on your craft and don't
[36:35] have to because I think a lot of people
[36:37] that aren't fully on Bitcoin, they have
[36:40] this fear of missing out of the next big
[36:43] thing. They're like, "Oh, this stock.
[36:45] Oh, Pal Palanteer stock. Oh, Nvidia
[36:48] stock or Tesla stock. Oh, what are they
[36:50] doing? Oh, it crashed down 20%. Maybe I
[36:52] can catch the uh uplag and oh maybe I
[36:55] should trade out of my Facebook stock
[36:56] and into my uh Google stock. Uh maybe I
[37:00] have to go in Uber now. What the heck?
[37:04] Like that's exhausting. I had a friend
[37:07] uh who is in Bitcoin. He's also into
[37:09] other things, but he just said, "Man, if
[37:11] it comes back down to 17,000, I'm like,
[37:14] what in the hell are you thinking, man?"
[37:16] It's like it's not going to do that. And
[37:19] it's going I mean if you look at a chart
[37:22] of
[37:23] like you ever been to the website priced
[37:25] in Bitcoin
[37:26] 21? Yeah. Yeah. Um Pyagi he's got he's
[37:32] got the idea. He takes all of the
[37:35] charts whether it's financial real
[37:38] estate commodities equities whatever and
[37:42] you chart them versus
[37:44] Bitcoin. And I remember listening to
[37:47] like Preston Pish a few years ago. He he
[37:48] even made that point. It's like you take
[37:51] the S&P versus the dollar and for the
[37:54] most part up and to the right. You take
[37:56] any stock versus the dollar up and to
[37:59] the right. But then when you take those
[38:01] same charts and compare it versus
[38:03] Bitcoin as a trading pair down and to
[38:05] the right, you know, and what does that
[38:07] say? It has nothing to do with the
[38:09] quality of the stock. It has nothing to
[38:10] do with the quality of the real estate.
[38:11] Has everything to do with the money
[38:13] supply. So it's
[38:15] like why are we chasing more dollars?
[38:18] that the Jack Mers why work for
[38:20] something that somebody can print for
[38:21] free. I'm paraphrasing, but it's that
[38:24] kind of idea. And it brought so
[38:28] much it brought so much clarity when I
[38:31] just was like, I want to get to a little
[38:34] bit more Satoshi's each month. Like if I
[38:38] can just if I look at my balance in
[38:41] Satoshi's, I want to have more Satoshi's
[38:44] the next month than previous month
[38:46] because I'm young and I'm in the
[38:48] stacking mode. Maybe if you are uh I
[38:51] don't know 65 and you're like okay
[38:53] getting retirement maybe you you can
[38:55] actually have less Satoshi every every
[38:57] month you can retire on Bitcoin and
[38:58] stuff like that. But for the most part,
[39:00] if you're in the accumulation fa phase
[39:02] of your life, um just having a little
[39:05] bit more satoshi each month is amazing.
[39:09] And I made that mistake previously and
[39:12] I'm not doing it now. I don't look
[39:15] anymore at the total net worth of myself
[39:18] in dollars or euros. I look at in
[39:22] Satoshi. How many Satoshi do I have? And
[39:26] this brings the whole thing of like oh
[39:29] my net worth goes down because we have
[39:32] this weird thing and I have really seen
[39:35] that people have Bitcoin and it goes
[39:39] down 20% or goes up 20%. If it goes up
[39:43] 20% people like hey I'm feeling so good
[39:47] uh and they feel almost 20% smarter.
[39:50] Yeah, if it goes down, they feel then
[39:53] 20% dumber. That's not the case.
[39:55] Like no matter what Bitcoin does, you
[39:58] are the same person. And what Bitcoin is
[40:00] one Bitcoin still. Uh so we we detaching
[40:04] yourself from the emotional roller
[40:07] coaster that comes from the feared world
[40:10] is really nice. And just stacking SS and
[40:12] and staying humble is amazing. you're
[40:14] based in objective reality as opposed to
[40:17] subjective, you know, subjective
[40:20] [ __ ] And you mentioned uh, you
[40:22] know, mental clarity. All of what you
[40:24] just said to me goes back to respecting
[40:26] energy. It's like you can you after you
[40:29] your studies for the past few years, you
[40:31] can see that this thing respects my
[40:34] energy more than that thing. So why base
[40:37] my reality off of fiat when I can base
[40:40] my reality off the sats? It's like being
[40:43] on a a strong foundation as opposed to
[40:45] quicksand. I have very sad news. Uh I
[40:51] think I I don't know. Uh I don't know
[40:55] how this happened, but I cannot go
[40:58] anymore to price in Bitcoin.
[41:02] And it was last time when I looked it
[41:05] up, it was still available, but all the
[41:07] data sheets were not not there. and was
[41:11] just there like a week or so ago. Yeah.
[41:14] And and now I' I I see also that that
[41:17] he's is
[41:19] saying is is saying things that that
[41:22] it's not no longer there. So I I don't
[41:24] know if it's if it's just right now if
[41:26] he's just do just doing it. Uh but it
[41:29] seems like there there has been some
[41:32] troubles because the last time I also
[41:33] couldn't uh open it. Uh so yeah, but
[41:36] maybe hopefully it's just on my side.
[41:38] Maybe there's a mistake on my side. I
[41:40] don't know or this will this this
[41:43] podcast will motivate him to I will
[41:45] explain it to him because priced in
[41:46] Bitcoin I have shown that website
[41:49] probably 10 times or 15 times already
[41:52] agreed agreed and just the concept just
[41:55] just the concept in itself is is is
[41:58] right on and I mean that's the way we
[42:00] once you have studied it enough you look
[42:02] at it that way and you're absolutely
[42:03] right like I still have like I talk to
[42:06] my father almost daily and he's actually
[42:09] one of the He's the guy that got me into
[42:10] Bitcoin in the first place, even though
[42:12] he got me into all the other stuff, too.
[42:15] I've since weeded all that out, and he's
[42:17] still kind of got a little altcoin
[42:21] craziness that I can't fix. I just chalk
[42:24] it up to old age. But, uh, when I talk
[42:27] to him, if a price dips down like 5%,
[42:31] he'll be like, "How are you feeling?"
[42:33] I'm
[42:34] like, "I feel fine. The hell?" you
[42:38] know, and I think he's just trying to
[42:40] check me to see, you know, from a trader
[42:42] mentality that he has if I'm okay. But
[42:45] it's like, nope, I'm okay now. I can get
[42:46] more sats. I've seen that with my family
[42:50] uh and friends even of
[42:53] like it's so fun. Uh uh after Bitcoin
[42:57] hit 100K, like it was like 105K. I went
[43:00] to brunch with with friends. Uh it was
[43:03] said way before that it was not like I
[43:06] made a brunch with friends because it
[43:07] hit 100k. It was just a completely
[43:09] separate thing. It was not not even
[43:11] organized for me. H and it was very
[43:13] funny because everyone knew I'm the
[43:15] Bitcoin guy and and everyone heard about
[43:17] that 100k and I usually am a very
[43:20] friendly guy. I'm usually I have a smile
[43:22] on my face. uh uh but when I entered uh
[43:28] I entered uh with my girlfriend and she
[43:30] just told me a joke in in that very
[43:32] moment where we entered and I had
[43:34] because of that a very big smile on my
[43:36] face and everyone was like oh the
[43:38] bitcoiner he has a smile on his face
[43:40] he's very happy right and it is true it
[43:44] has some you cannot blend all emotions
[43:47] out like you you will have some emotions
[43:50] if if bitcoin goes to 1 million US
[43:54] dollars next Friday. Oh jeez. We both
[43:57] will be at least a little bit more
[43:59] happy. I'll I'll send you a rocket emoji
[44:02] for sure. I send
[44:04] you a when moon kind of something or
[44:07] other. Right. Okay. We hit a million
[44:10] when 10 million. Yeah. Right. Those are
[44:12] rookie numbers.
[44:14] We have to just don't dance. Yeah. All
[44:19] dance. Yeah. But uh there's always
[44:22] emotions in in there. But I think we the
[44:25] the more we can get out of those
[44:27] emotions, the the better. Uh especially
[44:30] with the short-term volatility. If you
[44:33] are in since $10,000 US and you held
[44:36] through uh till like
[44:40] $500,000, you should be proud of
[44:42] yourself. You held through and and you
[44:44] should be happy about that fact. But
[44:47] just because Bitcoin is crashing down
[44:49] 20% in like three, four weeks, that's
[44:52] short-term BS and noise and just blend
[44:55] it out. It's like being a captain of a
[44:58] ship on a raging ocean. It's like, are
[45:01] you going to change your course just
[45:03] because one big wave came up over here?
[45:06] I'm not a sailor, so it's maybe not the
[45:08] best analogy, but uh you get the idea.
[45:10] It's like the waves are going to be
[45:12] there, but you're still you still have a
[45:15] destination.
[45:16] Absolutely. How how old is your your
[45:18] dad? Oh gosh. He was born in
[45:21] 48, so math almost 80. And he's trading
[45:27] meme coins.
[45:29] He's backed off of that, man. Um he has
[45:32] his Bitcoin. He's not going to sell it.
[45:34] Um he's a retired farmer, so he
[45:37] understands hard assets, farmland, gold.
[45:40] He's very much in that. Um, it was more
[45:43] of like being a farmer, you knew how to
[45:47] trade options, so you were more likely
[45:49] to go out on the risk curve, so to
[45:52] speak. Um, I'm not I I've been to Vegas
[45:56] and it's not really my kind of thing,
[45:58] but I think that's maybe more his kind
[46:00] of thing. Uh, just a little bit more
[46:03] risky, but teach their own, you know.
[46:07] Will you be in Vegas this year?
[46:10] Speaking of, yeah, I will be. Are you?
[46:13] Of course, dude. Okay, we got to meet
[46:15] up. That's awesome. Absolutely. And it's
[46:18] actually um it's really exciting because
[46:21] uh at least for me because most of my
[46:23] audience is in America. Yeah. And I've
[46:26] never been to an American conference. Uh
[46:31] so I've never met most of my like 50% of
[46:35] my audience is in America and I've never
[46:37] been to American conference. I've only
[46:38] been to the SA party, but uh there it's
[46:42] not not big. So being um being there
[46:46] will be awesome. Uh so I'm I'm really
[46:49] looking forward there. And I probably
[46:51] will also speak on stage uh on on
[46:53] something very interesting. Uh but I
[46:56] have uh it's still not confirmed what
[46:58] topic, but it will be it will be really
[47:00] cool to be there. That'll be awesome.
[47:02] I'll be in attendance. I'll be w I'll be
[47:05] waving the foam finger for you. the the
[47:08] phone finger. The phone, you know, like
[47:10] you're number one, you know. I'll be up
[47:11] there. I'll be up there cheering for
[47:13] you. I I'll print you a thing like
[47:16] Robin's biggest fan. There it is.
[47:20] No, that that that that will like Vegas
[47:22] will be um extremely cool. Um by the
[47:26] way, for because I I really want to meet
[47:29] a lot of uh the people that are just in
[47:33] America and uh I I get a lot of
[47:36] messages. cuz I get like like this and
[47:38] that and I I I love that. Um but meeting
[47:42] people in real in in real life in person
[47:45] is just a different beast for me. It
[47:47] it's it's so cool. It really is.
[47:50] Um you can you can get a lot uh conveyed
[47:54] through podcasts like this and virtual,
[47:56] but in person is so much different. Um I
[47:59] just went to a meetup in Chicago, which
[48:01] is about three hours north of me, right?
[48:05] And I met so many interesting people and
[48:08] had so deep of conversations just in
[48:11] that cuz like where I'm at it's the
[48:13] middle of a cornfield. We maybe get 10
[48:15] people at our meetup but there was at
[48:17] least you know 40 or 50 people up there.
[48:20] Um and it was you're absolutely right in
[48:23] person is just so much totally different
[48:25] vibe so different energy. Um and Vegas I
[48:29] just can't imagine how crazy it's going
[48:30] to be. It's it will be awesome and the
[48:34] meetups are great. Uh I we have actually
[48:37] the day one I I can't make it but we we
[48:40] have uh really great meetups in in
[48:42] Austria in Vienna also uh where like 20
[48:45] 30 40 people are there sometimes 50
[48:47] people. Um I heard about Austin having
[48:51] like meetups with 100 120 people uh on a
[48:55] regular basis that's almost like a small
[48:56] conference. I've been invited to
[48:58] conferences that are smaller than than
[49:00] meetups there. Uh so that that's awesome
[49:03] to see. Um, and in person is just
[49:06] amazing. And and I think the Las Vegas
[49:09] one will be just an interesting point
[49:10] where so many Bitcoiners come together
[49:12] and and celebrate uh a a a great time
[49:16] and maybe also the Bitcoin price is is
[49:18] is playing with us and and makes the
[49:21] whole thing uh even bigger because what
[49:24] I've seen with conferences, if the
[49:26] Bitcoin price goes up, there are just
[49:28] more people there and it makes more fun.
[49:31] Yeah. Uh my first conference uh and
[49:33] being being a teacher, I can only make
[49:35] summer conferences. You know, it's just
[49:37] really hard to travel during the school
[49:40] year. Uh my first conference was Miami
[49:42] two years ago and the price was down.
[49:46] And I it was my first conference. I'm
[49:47] like brighteyed and bushy tailed and I'm
[49:49] like loving it. And the people that have
[49:52] been there a long time, they're like,
[49:53] "Yeah, it's kind of lame. It's kind of
[49:55] small, you know, not a lot of people
[49:56] here." And then I went to Nashville last
[49:59] year and it was kind of a different
[50:01] story. Um I mean Nashville was I think a
[50:05] different beast also because of Trump,
[50:07] right? Yeah, that was that was that was
[50:12] strange. Um because being there on
[50:14] industry day uh the day before it there
[50:17] was just so much positive energy and a
[50:21] very tight-knit group and then it was
[50:24] just overwhelming the number of people
[50:26] that showed up for him to speak that
[50:28] day. It it was it was unreal. Like
[50:32] absolutely. Uh if you have in in summer
[50:36] time uh in June come to Prague also it's
[50:38] it's the best one in in Europe. I would
[50:41] love to. I would absolutely love to. It
[50:44] It's one conference. I don't usually
[50:46] partner up with conferences to on the
[50:49] podcast because it's just like a
[50:50] conference and it's like seasonal. Uh
[50:53] and and I don't like that. But uh I I
[50:56] really do enjoy uh uh Prague and it's
[50:59] it's almost it's so close to me. So I
[51:01] will be there in like 4 hours or
[51:03] something like that uh with with the
[51:05] train. I think that'd be great. Like you
[51:07] know they always have MC's and
[51:08] everything. That would be that'd be
[51:09] perfect for you. you know, get you up
[51:11] there and conducting everything. I Funny
[51:15] that you say that. I I hate MCing.
[51:19] Right. I did that in El Salvador. Uh
[51:23] because people said like, "Oh, like
[51:25] BMC." Like MC meaning um you are in
[51:29] between the talks and the panels.
[51:31] There's always like presentations for
[51:33] for the people that that that that don't
[51:35] know that much about conferences. There
[51:37] are usually presentations and panels and
[51:40] panels where you're the interviewer to a
[51:42] certain person, that kind of stuff.
[51:44] Yeah, exactly. And and then there's
[51:46] presentations where there's just a guy
[51:47] presenting something and panels are like
[51:49] with three, four people, three speakers
[51:52] and and one moderator and the MC is the
[51:55] guy in between the talks. Uh and I did
[51:58] that in um in El Salvador. I thought I I
[52:03] like it, but I did it and I hated it.
[52:06] Yeah, they're right.
[52:08] I I just I I really thought I like it.
[52:11] And sometimes you have to try something
[52:13] to discover that that you don't like it.
[52:15] And Bitcoin Prague actually asked me,
[52:18] "Oh, do you want to be an MC or because
[52:21] I will speak also in in Prague?" And
[52:23] they ask, "Oh, do you want to be MC?"
[52:25] And I'm like, "I made that experience.
[52:27] You don't want me as an MC?" Hey, teach
[52:30] your own, man. Yeah, I wouldn't I
[52:31] wouldn't want to do that to be honest.
[52:33] That's not my cup of tea. But uh that's
[52:35] interesting. I I I rather um go deeper
[52:40] like an MC goes out there and and and
[52:44] pushes an and theme. Like don't get me
[52:47] wrong, I can do it. I I I did it in in
[52:49] El Salvador. It's it's nice because I
[52:51] can just talk. I don't need an agenda to
[52:55] talk. You just put me on a stage and I
[52:57] talk.
[52:58] Um, but I rather have like an 1 hour a
[53:02] 2hour long in-depth conversation which
[53:05] doesn't happen on on conferences but the
[53:07] closest thing is a panel. I also don't
[53:10] like having a presentation. I will do
[53:12] one two presentations actually this year
[53:14] on smaller conferences but mostly I like
[53:18] to do panels and in Prague I I I don't
[53:22] want to spoil it and it's also not
[53:24] confirmed uh but I will do a panel with
[53:28] one guy I will be interviewing him and
[53:31] he will be on and it's one of my
[53:34] favorite guests that I ever had on my
[53:35] podcast and it will be really huge and
[53:38] will be probably on the main stage. Uh,
[53:40] and that's why I'm really looking
[53:42] forward to Prague. Also, you you can't
[53:44] share who that is though. I I don't want
[53:47] to share it till it's confirmed that
[53:50] there's no there's not there's nothing
[53:53] that I'm like, okay, because I don't
[53:54] want to say it and then it's not
[53:56] happening. Well, I I I'm I'm similar in
[54:00] that like being a teacher, I I don't
[54:02] like the presentation format. You know,
[54:04] being a musician, like I riff better
[54:07] when I'm um I'm playing off of somebody
[54:09] else, kind of like this conversation,
[54:11] you know, we're taking turns and we're
[54:12] adding back and forth. And to me,
[54:15] that's that's where it's at. That's
[54:18] where I I because I if I got asked to do
[54:21] one, I would not. I've done
[54:23] presentations before and they're kind of
[54:25] nerve-wracking, but when it gets to the
[54:27] question answer aspect of it, it's just
[54:29] like, oh, this is fun. We're just having
[54:30] a conversation here. So, I I see your
[54:32] point. Absolutely. And and panels are
[54:35] fun on on stage with like two, three
[54:37] people. Uh it's it's really nice. I did
[54:40] that multiple times last year. Really
[54:43] cool. Um, oh, I I just make a a small
[54:47] plug for for
[54:48] people. If you go to the conference,
[54:52] it's it's really really cool to go there
[54:54] and and find new people. Uh, and I've
[54:57] seen so many people having questions
[54:59] around that. Uh, feel free to to to
[55:02] shoot me a DM. I I had so much fear
[55:05] around going to my first Bitcoin
[55:07] conference because I didn't know anyone.
[55:10] Uh, and it was such a like I had a huge
[55:15] heart rate when I went into the first
[55:18] Bitcoin Prague conference like 3 years
[55:19] ago and then didn't know anyone. I was
[55:21] like I don't know what I'm doing here.
[55:24] So it does help if you just connect with
[55:26] someone and and and feel free to to to
[55:28] reach out to me. Also I have discounts
[55:30] codes for for all the things and stuff
[55:32] like that with with Robin. Uh but the
[55:34] important thing is uh if you need
[55:36] anything like reach out to me. Uh I this
[55:39] is something I I I really want to help
[55:41] people connecting in in Bitcoin. Uh
[55:44] that's what I basically do with with the
[55:46] the podcast and putting so many people
[55:48] on on the podcast and and trying to
[55:49] introduce new new people and old people
[55:52] into the Bitcoin audience.
[55:54] I love that. Be cool. Um I have one new
[55:57] question that I ask each and every one
[55:59] of my guests and the the question is
[56:01] what can we learn from you besides
[56:03] Bitcoin? Oof. Um well, if you need to
[56:07] learn
[56:08] uh the general music, I can teach you
[56:11] that if you need to know music theory.
[56:13] Uh no. Um aside from that,
[56:18] I'm that's a good question. I'm one
[56:21] aspect of
[56:24] Bitcoin that can and we've touched on it
[56:26] that continues to fascinate me is how it
[56:30] can improve the social layer. One of the
[56:33] reasons I got into education in the
[56:34] first place, besides the idea that, oh,
[56:39] instead of just talking [ __ ] about our
[56:42] lack of education, go do something about
[56:43] it. You know, the man in the arena
[56:45] thought. But a lot of my motivation was
[56:49] because I was noticing that at least my
[56:53] part of the
[56:54] world there was a huge lack of respect,
[56:58] lack of
[56:59] um motivation, lack of
[57:02] um desire to continue to improve.
[57:07] So in through my Bitcoin journey, I'm
[57:10] I'm seeing
[57:11] that maybe Bitcoin doesn't fix this, you
[57:15] know, outright, but I think Bitcoin
[57:18] incentivizes good behavior amongst its
[57:23] participants. And something that I've
[57:25] really tried to just understand myself
[57:28] is what is that connection and how can
[57:32] not just owning Bitcoin, but studying
[57:34] Bitcoin help make us
[57:36] better and treat each other better on
[57:38] the social layer. That's that's so the
[57:41] social layer is is so underrated. I
[57:44] think that there are some some books
[57:46] even around the social layer. I think uh
[57:48] but I think it's a topic that's
[57:51] still mi mis
[57:55] misunder it it's it's not highly
[57:58] valued. That's not a good word that I'm
[58:00] finding now buted.
[58:02] Yeah. Well represented. So like that
[58:04] there needs to be a higher focus on that
[58:06] and people like Jeff W make a big a big
[58:09] uh push for that but it's it's it it's
[58:12] we need even a bigger one for that.
[58:14] Yeah. Really really cool. Um we have the
[58:17] endine as you know where the uh previous
[58:20] guest is asking a question for the next
[58:21] guest without knowing who the next guest
[58:23] actually is and the previous guest asked
[58:25] you the question which nation state is
[58:27] most likely to print their own currency
[58:30] to buy Bitcoin? Oh man. Oh gosh. I would
[58:34] think it would have to be without like
[58:36] being specific, I would think it would
[58:38] make sense for a third world nation. I
[58:41] don't think it's going to be one of
[58:43] the large world powers. Um because that
[58:47] would be that would create too much
[58:50] disorder, economic disorder. I think a
[58:53] smaller country is just like, "Hey,
[58:55] here's our shot. Who is that going to
[58:57] be?" No clue. I'm not a geopolitical
[59:01] expert by any stretch, but I'm going to
[59:03] go with a small under the radar country.
[59:06] Maybe somebody who already like does
[59:08] some Bitcoin mining, so hasn't has a
[59:10] little bit of skin in the game and just
[59:12] wants to try and bump up that ranking.
[59:14] Yeah, it's also my biggest guess, but
[59:17] also America is close by. I don't know.
[59:20] They they have to because till now they
[59:23] just they just basically said okay the
[59:26] the bitcoin we have we are holding it
[59:28] and now we are calling it the strategic
[59:30] bitcoin reserve but they also have to
[59:33] buy I think but so my understanding is
[59:36] without getting too political uh Trump
[59:38] seems to like a strong dollar and that
[59:41] to me would go against that just
[59:43] printing money straight out outright
[59:45] they've been talking about doing
[59:46] budgetneutral things like selling off
[59:48] some gold to buy bitcoin And that's not
[59:50] really printing dollars. So I
[59:54] I and I don't particularly want
[59:57] um I don't particularly want us to print
[60:00] money um to buy Bitcoin.
[60:04] Um I it's weird because I'm not one of
[60:08] those that are all like, "Yes, the
[60:10] government should buy all the Bitcoin in
[60:12] the world." Because I still believe we
[60:14] got to get the little man a chance,
[60:16] right?
[60:18] But I'm also not of the opinion that
[60:21] government should have no dealings in
[60:22] Bitcoin because first of all, Bitcoin
[60:25] doesn't care. You know, it's going to do
[60:27] what it's going to do. If you believe
[60:29] that, if you believe that Bitcoin is for
[60:31] everyone and you also believe that
[60:33] Bitcoin is
[60:35] anti-fragile, then a government holding
[60:37] it can't really change it per se. They
[60:39] can't change the protocol, right? So any
[60:42] positive externalities that come from
[60:45] Bitcoin should go through the government
[60:47] that chooses to adopt it. So I'm not
[60:52] like all bowled up on governments owning
[60:53] all the Bitcoin. I'm also not anti like
[60:56] they shouldn't even touch it. I'm kind
[60:58] of in the middle just saying, hey,
[61:00] Bitcoin's good and if it's good for
[61:02] everybody and nobody can break it, then
[61:04] it should be good for governments also.
[61:06] So I kind of come down in the middle
[61:07] there. Governments is basically also
[61:10] just a group of people, right? Really?
[61:12] Really? Yeah.
