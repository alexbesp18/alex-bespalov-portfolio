[00:00] it's hard to convey to people like how
[00:02] difficult that situation has been and
[00:04] one of the more painful things about it
[00:06] is when you consider that that's 10
[00:08] years of all my productivity you know
[00:11] every money that I've earned every
[00:12] business project that I've worked on
[00:15] every bit of capital have accumulated
[00:17] got wiped out my dad just said one word
[00:19] he's sitting at his laptop and he just
[00:21] says yeah I've I've been hacked and
[00:23] that's when it hits you like a ton of
[00:26] bricks so when I heard about your story
[00:28] my main concern holy man I better
[00:30] call this guy before he does something
[00:31] he's going to regret don't do what I did
[00:34] make this investment before you get
[00:36] hilariously
[00:38] Rich before we get into how he lost this
[00:42] 25 Bitcoin um Rick before we get into
[00:46] that I want to know like why did you
[00:49] came into Bitcoin in the first place uh
[00:51] when did you came into the space uh what
[00:53] was a journey as a bitcoiner before this
[00:56] all happened sure uh so yeah I mean we
[01:00] we were fortunate we got into Bitcoin
[01:01] like really really early you know we
[01:04] were sort of looking at it around late
[01:06] 2012 and we first started buying it in
[01:09] 2013 um what what's interesting about
[01:13] that I think is is just how early we
[01:15] were in terms of like we didn't dismiss
[01:17] it straight away like a lot of people um
[01:20] and we actually as soon as we found it
[01:22] we just Dove right into it you know with
[01:24] both feet um the main reason that we
[01:27] discovered it at all and and and got so
[01:29] interested in it is because um well my
[01:32] my dad is like I guess you would say
[01:34] he's a seriously based person um what do
[01:37] I mean by that is like long before
[01:39] Bitcoin even existed even when I was a
[01:42] young boy he would sort of sit me down
[01:45] and explain to me uh the problems
[01:47] associated with Central Banking he would
[01:50] explain the fractional Reserve banking
[01:52] scam uh and how they create money out of
[01:55] thin air so before he saw the solution
[01:59] which is Bitcoin he was already hyper
[02:01] aware of the problem so you know I
[02:04] wouldn't say he was a gold bug but he
[02:05] would be attracted to hard assets and
[02:08] and things like that and he understood
[02:09] the game as as the bankers were playing
[02:11] it um so you know I guess I guess you
[02:15] could say we we're pretty distrustful of
[02:17] authority already and and we're that way
[02:20] inclined and yeah I mean I have a lot to
[02:23] to thank my dad for right like he really
[02:25] drilled it into me that you you you
[02:27] should think critically for yourself and
[02:30] you shouldn't just follow the herd
[02:31] because you know that that often doesn't
[02:33] lead you to to the right destination and
[02:35] that sort of thing so I guess we were in
[02:38] the right place at the right time and um
[02:42] you know combine that with the fact that
[02:43] my dad's a been a developer for 50 odd
[02:46] years you know he started off uh working
[02:49] on like IBM 360 assembler you know went
[02:52] through most popular programming
[02:54] languages like C++ and he now plays with
[02:58] like nodejs and docker and stuff even
[03:00] today so you know he he he's very
[03:03] softwar minded right uh and and very
[03:06] talented technically so and at the same
[03:09] time I was going through University and
[03:12] uh you know uh had quite a lot of
[03:14] modules about economics uh and this sort
[03:17] of thing so I had a I had an interest in
[03:19] economics anyway um so I guess if you
[03:22] kind of draw this V diagram of of
[03:24] Technology meeting economics when we
[03:27] found it we just got really obsessed and
[03:30] and really excited by it and I think
[03:33] another thing that really benefited us
[03:35] as well is back then uh there was only
[03:38] Bitcoin right like we were we were
[03:40] fascinated with Bitcoin before ethereum
[03:42] even launched and we really benefited
[03:45] from that because compared to someone
[03:47] entering the the the sort of space now
[03:50] there wasn't all these distractions
[03:52] there weren't all these thousands of of
[03:54] shitcoins there weren't nfts there
[03:57] weren't these like yield farming things
[03:59] where you know you try and earn yield on
[04:01] your Bitcoin so what that meant was it
[04:04] was really quiet and you could just
[04:06] focus on bitcoin itself and really go
[04:09] deep and understand how it works and
[04:11] what it means um so yeah after
[04:14] discovering it you know for the next few
[04:16] months every time I'd get back from work
[04:18] and stuff like that me and my dad would
[04:19] spend literally hours on the phone every
[04:22] night talking about like what does this
[04:24] mean what what is the future what is
[04:25] this what is that you know falling all
[04:27] over
[04:28] ourselves um and like I say discovering
[04:31] it so early was was beneficial for the
[04:33] rest of our experience in Bitcoin
[04:36] because we had enough time to learn what
[04:39] Bitcoin was all about before say
[04:41] ethereum launched so then when ethereum
[04:43] launched and you know it didn't have
[04:46] this Immaculate Conception that Bitcoin
[04:48] had you know it had quite clearly a
[04:51] Founder who then went and raised a load
[04:53] of VC monies through through an Ico and
[04:57] so instantly we looked at ethereum and
[04:59] thought well this is kind of this is
[05:00] kind of the antithesis of Bitcoin um so
[05:04] we were lucky we never got dragged into
[05:06] those problems which is is one of the
[05:07] reasons I think we managed to hold the
[05:09] Bitcoin for so long for 10 years because
[05:12] we could recognize through our
[05:15] understanding of Bitcoin that the other
[05:17] things being brought to Market were
[05:18] quite clearly scams you know uh poorly
[05:22] designed at best and and outright scams
[05:24] at worst you know um so yeah that that's
[05:28] kind of how we got into it yeah
[05:31] and uh when you now take us to the
[05:33] moment where you first uh realize that
[05:37] you might have lost uh all this Bitcoin
[05:41] you saved up for so long how was that
[05:44] like how did where did you where uh what
[05:47] happened what's the story
[05:49] about yeah it's a it's a pretty
[05:51] harrowing story you know so
[05:54] um it's hard to convey to people like
[05:56] how how how difficult that situation has
[06:00] been because what I want to get across
[06:02] to people is you know I'm a I'm a fully
[06:03] paid up bitcoiner so Bitcoin is where I
[06:06] was storing my wealth right I would
[06:08] never sit on big piles of Fiat money
[06:10] because why would I want to hold a a
[06:13] currency that's just you know
[06:14] evaporating essentially so you know it's
[06:17] it's a it's a real heavy loss that we
[06:19] took and and one of the more painful
[06:21] things about it is when you consider
[06:23] that that's 10 years of all my
[06:26] productivity you know every money that
[06:28] I've earned every business project that
[06:31] I've I've worked on every bit of capital
[06:33] I've accumulated got wiped out so yeah
[06:36] it sucked a big one um but let me
[06:40] explain sort of how it happened right so
[06:42] the the short version of that story is
[06:45] that well even more crushing is after 10
[06:47] years me and my dad decide right we want
[06:50] to go and check out El Salvador and see
[06:51] what's going on over there because you
[06:54] know after 10 years of pontificating
[06:56] about what a Bitcoin standard might mean
[06:59] for Society in the world we're super
[07:02] excited to go and see what's happening
[07:04] on the ground in El Salvador um and I
[07:07] mean you couldn't write it man we we'd
[07:09] been to adopting BTC conference for
[07:12] three days and on the last day we come
[07:15] back to our uh apartment in San Salvador
[07:18] right and uh we've been listening to all
[07:21] these amazing talks and we're all pumped
[07:23] up and excited and for the last few
[07:25] months my dad and I have actually been
[07:27] working on developing a a Bitcoin
[07:30] related app that runs using the
[07:32] lightning Network for payments uh and
[07:35] because we were so excited and fired up
[07:37] we thought uh oh you know let's go and
[07:38] play with it we're all
[07:41] enthusiastic now to go and play with it
[07:43] and test it one of the things we had to
[07:45] do was fund a lightning channel so my
[07:48] dad goes to his laptop in the flat uh
[07:51] that we rented and he says right I'm
[07:53] going to transfer some funds
[07:55] across and this is the really visceral
[07:57] bit that I'll never forget is uh I mean
[08:00] Robin I don't know if I can swear on
[08:02] your podcast um but the the next go
[08:05] ahead well my dad just said one word
[08:08] he's sitting at his laptop and he just
[08:10] says and nothing else and you know
[08:14] I'm I think this is quite innocuous at
[08:16] first I say oh you know what's up uh
[08:18] maybe his laptop's died or he stubbed
[08:20] his toe or I I don't know and then he
[08:22] says uh yeah I've I've been hacked and
[08:27] man I it's so hard to describe that
[08:29] feeling because you know first of all
[08:31] you have this huge rush of sort of
[08:33] cortisol
[08:35] adrenaline um you know your fight or
[08:38] flight response sort of kicks in my
[08:40] whole body is shaking you know I'm
[08:42] pacing up and down just a million
[08:45] thoughts all at once uh is is the best
[08:47] way to describe it you know I I've
[08:50] planned like I had a lot of plans for
[08:52] what I was going to do with that capital
[08:53] and how it was going to change my life
[08:55] my family's life you know I take care of
[08:58] my parents you know lots of things and
[09:01] you start realizing very quickly oh like
[09:04] all of those plans are kind of ripped up
[09:07] to shreds now and that that that's
[09:09] that's that's pretty tough so the next
[09:13] part of the story is uh that you know
[09:16] you start then bargaining so my dad had
[09:19] actually bought a new laptop like a
[09:21] couple of months prior and during that
[09:24] like he runs a few businesses currently
[09:27] um and I he remembers that moved some
[09:29] files around and did some reorganization
[09:32] so for a brief moment he says uh H do
[09:36] you know what maybe I maybe I
[09:37] transferred to a different address or
[09:39] you know maybe I'm looking at the wrong
[09:41] wallet you know maybe this is just maybe
[09:43] this isn't real and so off he goes
[09:45] trying to explore that and uh at this
[09:48] point my brain had slowed down just
[09:50] enough for me to say hey Dad uh send me
[09:53] the transaction IDs of the funds leaving
[09:55] the wallet so I can go and have a look
[09:58] and I go to me pool dospace I Chuck in a
[10:01] couple of the transaction IDs and that's
[10:03] when it hits you like a ton of bricks
[10:06] because now I can see you know payments
[10:08] of three Bitcoin going off here four
[10:10] Bitcoin going off there and then it
[10:13] going on and on and on through multiple
[10:15] addresses to the point where we you know
[10:18] it wasn't us like we we definitely
[10:20] didn't send these transactions and yeah
[10:22] it is real and yeah that Bitcoin is now
[10:25] an address that we don't control so that
[10:29] that was the experience of finding out
[10:31] and man it's it's bizarre like 10 years
[10:34] you go on this pilgrimage to El Salvador
[10:36] you're you're on this trip of a lifetime
[10:38] with your dad you know getting to spend
[10:40] time with your dad on on something pass
[10:42] a passion that you both
[10:44] love it was wild um you know there's
[10:47] there's no other way to describe it but
[10:49] uh yeah that's that's the process of us
[10:51] finding
[10:52] out what what was the reaction of the
[10:55] community did you were at the Bitcoin
[10:58] conference all Al afterwards did you
[11:00] speak with people in person how was the
[11:03] reaction when you posted everything on
[11:05] on X or
[11:06] Twitter I I mean yeah you know it's
[11:09] funny to me like bitcoiners often get
[11:11] this sort of oh they're toxic they're
[11:13] this they're that the other but for
[11:15] anyone who's been around long enough
[11:16] they know that you scratch the surface
[11:18] of of Bitcoin culture and what you find
[11:21] in the middle is just an army of really
[11:25] wonderful friendly supportive uh and
[11:28] also extremely talented people um so I
[11:32] couldn't tell you what made me decide to
[11:34] post it to to to Twitter right because
[11:37] I'm not I'm not I don't post a lot or I
[11:40] didn't used to post a lot on on social
[11:42] media um because I'm quite a private guy
[11:45] you know I was busy living my life I I
[11:47] you know social media can be a bit of an
[11:49] angry place right so so I try and stay
[11:51] stay offline if I can um but I I felt
[11:55] like I posted it because it was just me
[11:57] and my dad trapped in this bubble in a
[11:58] foreign country miles away from home and
[12:01] no one else is going to understand this
[12:03] situation like the Bitcoin community so
[12:06] I took a random decision like I'll I'll
[12:08] post about it and and I mean it went
[12:11] crazy man like I you know I've never
[12:13] gone viral before but you know three
[12:15] million four million views later uh my
[12:18] phone like just exploding um and I and I
[12:21] have a huge thanks actually I need to
[12:23] give out to the whole Community uh I'm
[12:26] so incredibly grateful uh I'm not going
[12:29] to shout everyone out because a lot of
[12:30] people wanted to stay Anonymous who
[12:32] reached out and DM and gave us
[12:34] information but you know there's a few
[12:36] standouts so like the guys at Samurai
[12:38] wallet they have the the research arm uh
[12:41] so Ergo BTC on Twitter um you know these
[12:45] Galaxy brain guys you know through just
[12:48] took their own time their own effort
[12:50] they they're helping us track the
[12:52] transactions through the blockchain
[12:54] they're sending me graphs that show like
[12:56] where it's gone where it's been mixed
[12:59] where some of it might have interacted
[13:00] with kyc
[13:02] exchanges um you know and in my DMs man
[13:05] you know I had some of the most
[13:07] influential sort of people in in in the
[13:09] Bitcoin space which oh man you know I'd
[13:12] love to go into a conversation with some
[13:13] of these guys under better circumstances
[13:16] right um but you know the fact that they
[13:18] reached out and they're just so
[13:20] lovely I don't know how I would have
[13:22] felt if I hadn't have done that but I
[13:25] really do believe that the Bitcoin
[13:26] Community kind of lifted me out of of of
[13:30] potentially very dark hole and
[13:34] uh you know what it was as upsetting as
[13:38] it is to lose the money the thing that
[13:40] choked me up the most when I was out
[13:42] there was this flood of support I've
[13:44] never really been on the receiving end
[13:46] of something so just a tidal wave of of
[13:49] positivity like that and it really hits
[13:51] you in the fields man like it's it's
[13:53] kind of wild so yeah you know I I
[13:56] wouldn't have half an idea really of
[13:59] what happened where we went wrong or or
[14:02] anything and I wouldn't have been able
[14:03] to put a case together for the
[14:05] authorities and and to effectively speak
[14:07] to exchanges and the things I needed to
[14:09] do next if the Bitcoin Community hadn't
[14:12] rallied around me and and and it's truly
[14:14] something I'll never forget um and one
[14:17] guy in the DMS who who a man he's he
[14:20] stayed up like all night to talk to me
[14:22] and and we talked about life philosophy
[14:24] politics and and all this stuff and he
[14:26] just said look just make sure that you
[14:28] pay this for
[14:29] right like this story should be shared
[14:31] and other people should be aware of what
[14:33] happened to you because it will save
[14:36] some other people so I feel like I owe
[14:38] the community at least that much so hey
[14:41] man I'm not going to lie it's pretty
[14:42] embarrassing to come out and talk about
[14:44] our seed phrases being stored in the
[14:46] cloud and all this stuff but hey look if
[14:48] it saves someone else it's the right
[14:50] thing to
[14:51] do and this was the moment when also the
[14:55] bitco way uh reached out to you we can
[14:57] help I mean the S completely scrambled
[15:01] eggs for brains um and Tony's just
[15:04] running us through you know he's just
[15:06] asking us the basic questions like you
[15:07] know can people get access to your
[15:09] machine let's try and figure out if it
[15:11] could be someone you know or you know uh
[15:15] have you run any scans for malware do
[15:17] you think there could have been key
[15:18] loggers involved where were the seeds
[15:20] stored so that at least we could to
[15:22] narrow down what we think might have
[15:25] happened and how we might progress uh we
[15:28] did not hear you for a little while Rick
[15:31] for like like a second but uh sorry can
[15:33] you hear me now yeah I can hear you now
[15:36] I like that Tony and the Bitcoin way
[15:39] reached out and so many other people in
[15:41] the Bitcoin Community reached out and
[15:43] and I saw also one tweet of yours where
[15:47] you told the story when you come back
[15:50] from uh to to Scotland and your your
[15:54] girlfriend picked you up and you said
[15:56] something like that you feel like the
[15:58] luest man alive did anything uh like did
[16:01] this hack besides your knowledge and
[16:03] besides maybe your mission did anything
[16:06] uh did you learn anything more from from
[16:11] that oh yeah I mean you know it's crazy
[16:15] it's crazy the amount of thoughts I've
[16:17] had about life and Bitcoin and just
[16:19] everything since you know I think what's
[16:22] important to point out is I'm not really
[16:24] a very Money Motivated person uh but the
[16:27] thing that motivat me most in life is
[16:30] freedom uh and Bitcoin was my route to
[16:33] achieve that that freedom uh and that
[16:35] sort of self sovereignty right so you
[16:38] know on the one hand I'm thankful that
[16:41] you know I've been around long enough to
[16:42] know that it's still pretty
[16:44] spectacularly early um you know one
[16:48] thing I can relay to people is like
[16:50] every cycle I've thought this is the
[16:52] time when everyone's going to figure it
[16:53] out it's going to go completely
[16:55] mainstream all the shitcoins will die
[16:58] all the blockchain bozos will die um and
[17:01] every single time I've been wrong about
[17:03] that and I think we're probably further
[17:05] away from hyperbitcoinization than than
[17:08] people probably realize I think this is
[17:10] a this is a long fight right like the US
[17:13] dollar is not going anywhere in the next
[17:15] five years in my opinion I think we'll
[17:17] continue to win the fight but ultimately
[17:20] I still think you know I'm going to be
[17:22] ahead of 90% of the population in this
[17:24] so if my goal is freedom rather than
[17:26] money I still feel like that's
[17:29] achievable for me and something that I
[17:31] can pursue so it's worth getting back up
[17:33] and getting back on the horse and and
[17:35] continuing and uh yeah big shout out to
[17:38] my fiance right like um well first of
[17:41] all the wedding next year is still going
[17:43] ahead uh which is great uh which uh yeah
[17:46] she she is here for the revolution not
[17:48] the money so she's a really good egg you
[17:51] know I'm really lucky there and uh I
[17:53] have a roof over my head I have food in
[17:55] my belly um you know we're driving
[17:57] around El Salvador and you know there's
[17:59] there's people who are far far far worse
[18:02] off on this planet than I am and it
[18:05] wouldn't be acceptable for me to just
[18:09] play the victim forever and feel really
[18:11] bad for myself because I have it very
[18:13] very good um you know in in Grand in the
[18:17] grand scheme of things and and I wasn't
[18:19] raised like that right so so I'm not
[18:22] going to tell you it doesn't sting I'm
[18:23] not going to tell you that some days I'm
[18:25] not pretty pissed off at the world and
[18:27] and pretty pretty pretty upset but uh
[18:30] but by and large you know already on the
[18:32] path to to to to getting to a better
[18:35] place and and trying to use it to get
[18:36] stronger you know what else can you
[18:39] do that's beautiful um maybe also
[18:43] together maybe with Tony um what exactly
[18:46] happened uh what what was the mistake
[18:49] for people that maybe didn't don't know
[18:51] the story um and how can everybody that
[18:55] is listening avoiding this and what are
[18:57] the lessons on a on a self custodial
[19:01] side of things uh for for someone that
[19:05] is now a little bit afraid okay I might
[19:09] um lose my Bitcoin how can I make sure
[19:11] that I don't lose my Bitcoin how can I
[19:13] make sure that I don't I'm not
[19:17] hacked well I think what I can probably
[19:19] do is is take us like step by step of
[19:21] what happened and then between each step
[19:24] Tony can say and this is what we should
[19:25] have done right that might be an
[19:27] interesting way to do
[19:29] um the first thing I really want to
[19:31] point out before we even get into our
[19:33] setup is understand I want people to
[19:36] understand that we held this Bitcoin for
[19:37] 10 years now over that 10 year span we
[19:41] could have lost that Bitcoin a 100 times
[19:43] over the main reason that we didn't lose
[19:47] that Bitcoin is because we self- custodi
[19:50] it you know there's a lot of famous
[19:52] exchanges that have blown up so many in
[19:54] that 10 years that I couldn't list them
[19:56] all you know so leave if if we'd have
[19:58] ever left our Bitcoin with a custodian
[20:02] there is like a 100% chance that we
[20:04] would have lost it so the first thing I
[20:05] want people to get is do do the self-
[20:07] custody just do it better than we did so
[20:10] then you know let let's move on I think
[20:13] the the place to start is
[20:15] kyc right I'll get to the mistakes we
[20:18] made later because we we definitely made
[20:20] some clangers of mistakes but where we
[20:22] think the story starts is with kyc so uh
[20:26] we found out later when we work with the
[20:28] authorities that my dad's name and
[20:31] details were stolen during the mount gox
[20:35] hack because we were using that as our
[20:37] very first exchange so when that
[20:40] exchange was hacked the hackers must
[20:42] have also been able to access all of the
[20:44] customer information which would have
[20:46] included things like the name uh the
[20:49] amount of Bitcoin purchased the
[20:51] addresses and transactions of that
[20:53] Bitcoin leaving the exchange and what
[20:55] addresses they went to and all of this
[20:57] right
[20:59] so I don't think that we were hacked
[21:02] randomly and that some random hacker
[21:05] just hit the jackpot by finding us I
[21:08] think it's actually far more likely that
[21:10] they were aware that we held a lot of
[21:12] Bitcoin and that they came after us
[21:14] specifically so um yeah you know I I
[21:18] think totally differently about kyc now
[21:21] because whilst it was a digital attack
[21:23] this time it could have very easily been
[21:26] a physical group of people people
[21:28] showing up at my dad's house when I live
[21:30] miles away and doing something much
[21:33] scarier than just stealing our money so
[21:36] kyc
[21:37] now I knew it was a problem right I knew
[21:40] it was a problem but I didn't sit and
[21:42] think this through enough um so you know
[21:45] maybe maybe Tony there can sort of
[21:47] elaborate on on you know the problems
[21:49] with K kyc and what approach people can
[21:52] take to to sort of protect themselves
[21:54] from
[21:56] that yeah I mean KY see you know most
[21:59] people have bought their Bitcoin via kyc
[22:01] the traditional you know know your
[22:03] customer procedure that you know you've
[22:05] known your whole life would come with
[22:07] anything relating to money and Banks you
[22:09] know you have to Pro provide all sorts
[22:11] of identification and answer all sorts
[22:13] of you know silly questions pertaining
[22:15] to your source of funds and what have
[22:17] you now all this is being marketed
[22:19] obviously as for your own protection and
[22:21] protection of your funds and to protect
[22:23] against you know terrorism and money
[22:25] laundering and all that rubbish but
[22:27] essentially has nothing to do with any
[22:29] of this all of this are just elaborate
[22:32] surveillance and control Tools in order
[22:34] to keep an eye out on every transaction
[22:37] from every individual no matter where
[22:38] you are around you know around the
[22:40] planet that's what it's for now it may
[22:43] have been fine in the traditional
[22:45] Financial system because you know it was
[22:47] designed by the same people who designed
[22:49] this rigged Ponzi to begin with but when
[22:52] you have a new asset like Bitcoin
[22:54] something that we've never seen the
[22:55] world has never seen you know an
[22:58] appreciating asset an asset that has a
[23:00] finite Supply an asset that will always
[23:02] go up in value no matter no matter what
[23:06] and that more importantly nobody can
[23:07] manipulate you know and and mess around
[23:10] with well then you know when people when
[23:13] more people start to understand how
[23:15] precious and valuable that is well you
[23:17] know they start this you know the
[23:19] attention the eyes open up wider you
[23:22] know upon this and what's the easiest
[23:24] way to get a hold of it if you don't
[23:25] have it well it's to steal it right and
[23:28] so you know some people are you know
[23:30] they they fear Monger about physical
[23:32] attacks and while yes technically that
[23:34] is possible I don't believe physical
[23:36] attacks are going to be your biggest uh
[23:39] concern the big the most efficient way
[23:42] to steal something that that's online to
[23:44] begin with is online via you know cyber
[23:46] attacks fishing scams things of that
[23:49] nature and this is where I genuinely
[23:51] believe you know we'll start seeing more
[23:53] prevalent cases pop up of you know
[23:55] scenarios of somebody losing their coins
[23:58] because of X Y or Z and it's most likely
[24:00] going to be due to an online problem
[24:03] that took place so protecting yourself
[24:07] you know from kyc is essentially
[24:09] eliminating that Target that's painted
[24:11] on your back because you know if if a
[24:13] hacker wants to find out who owns
[24:15] Bitcoin well you know there's so many
[24:17] honeypots now all these exchanges s
[24:19] databases of everyone that's purchased
[24:22] the coins from there they just have to
[24:24] Target them it's it's not that hard and
[24:26] as we've seen in the past three years
[24:28] there's been many stories of data leak
[24:30] here data leak there you know like and
[24:32] most of these leaks can be easily
[24:34] avoided but you're assuming that the
[24:36] people in charge of these companies of
[24:38] these institutions are actually doing
[24:41] their job you know are actually taking
[24:43] the the security of that data you know
[24:46] properly but but most of them aren't
[24:49] which is why these these leaks seem so
[24:51] casually done you know this this is
[24:54] what's scary and if your name is on a
[24:56] list you know whoever hacked that
[24:59] database that's not an idiot this is
[25:01] someone or or a group of people that
[25:04] know exactly what they're after and
[25:07] so if your name is on a list you
[25:09] potentially have a problem because if
[25:11] somebody decides to Target you for
[25:12] whatever
[25:14] reason you better have a plan to deal
[25:16] with it whe whether it's physically you
[25:18] know if it shows up at your front door
[25:21] or otherwise now physically you know
[25:23] that's that's that's one conversation
[25:26] but the more efficient way is to protect
[25:29] yourself online to begin with and that
[25:32] and that begins by education you know
[25:34] there's a lot of information that a lot
[25:37] of people don't know yet you know and it
[25:39] requires a certain amount of discipline
[25:42] to sit down learn pay attention but more
[25:44] importantly follow through you know
[25:47] certain guidelines repeatedly so that
[25:50] you don't make a mistake it's almost
[25:51] like a workout you know like a mental
[25:53] workout because now you're assuming
[25:55] responsibility of your money something
[25:57] you've never never ever had to do before
[25:59] and you're going to want to do it
[26:01] because this is your generational wealth
[26:03] this is not a debasing currency that is
[26:06] manipulated by a group of Thieves you
[26:08] know this is an actual asset that for
[26:10] the first time in history anyone can Own
[26:13] 100% And so you're going to want to
[26:15] guard it with your life because it's
[26:16] going to become the most important thing
[26:18] you own so there's no joking around here
[26:21] there's no being complacent there's no
[26:22] being lazy taking shortcuts you know if
[26:25] you're serious about protecting your
[26:27] savings you know your heritage your
[26:28] legacy especially if you have kids down
[26:30] the line you know you need to do what
[26:33] you have to do and that's being
[26:35] responsible but again you know it's it's
[26:37] a learning curve it's not something you
[26:39] know that people are going to you know
[26:41] go from zero to 100 with overnight it's
[26:43] a progress you don't need to go to from
[26:46] zero to 100 instantly but you need to
[26:48] accept that this is something that you
[26:50] need it's it's the key to your freedom
[26:52] it's the key to living with any form of
[26:55] dignity for you your family going
[26:57] forward forward so that you're not um
[26:59] subservient to a bunch of people that
[27:01] hate you you know that put you through
[27:03] living conditions that you know you
[27:05] wouldn't t on your on your worst enemy
[27:08] so that's the danger of kyc and
[27:10] thankfully there are ways to to deal
[27:13] with it one of the most commonly known
[27:15] ones are the are coin joints where
[27:17] basically it gives you forward privacy
[27:19] from the moment you engage in that coin
[27:21] joint it's like uh think of it as like
[27:23] you take out money from an ATM you know
[27:25] the bank knows you took out you know
[27:27] whatever you took out but has no idea
[27:28] what you spent it on so the coin join
[27:31] essentially does the same thing for your
[27:32] Bitcoin the you know the exchange knows
[27:34] you bought x amount but then what
[27:37] happened to it God knows so if you say
[27:39] you lost it somewhere well then you know
[27:42] it's going to be very hard to prove that
[27:43] you didn't lose it because the
[27:45] connection between you and these coins
[27:47] is is severed at that point so that's
[27:51] just one way but other there's many
[27:52] other ways to deal with this but you
[27:54] know that's that's a very long
[27:55] conversation but for now you know like
[27:57] will'll stick to the most commonly known
[28:00] ones yeah and and you know what that's
[28:02] something that that me and my dad just
[28:04] privacy we'd not taken seriously enough
[28:07] like when when Mount gox was hacked we
[28:09] never sat and thought Oh I wonder if
[28:12] they got any of our personal information
[28:13] it didn't even cross our minds we were
[28:15] just happy that we were smart enough to
[28:16] self custody to not lose the corn right
[28:20] um so the the kind of things I'm
[28:22] thinking of now is like actually you
[28:24] know my data it could get leaked you
[28:27] know let's say I buy a hardware wallet
[28:28] from a manufacturer okay they're a
[28:30] Honeypot their details might get leaked
[28:33] but let's say someone some attacker has
[28:35] my details from Mount goau right knows I
[28:39] own some Bitcoin and wants some more
[28:40] details about me like my address or
[28:42] something well you know anywhere that
[28:45] I've put my data on the internet whether
[28:47] I'm ordering a pair of socks from a
[28:49] supermarket or whatever I'm giving out
[28:52] this information everywhere so one of
[28:53] the the simple things that I'm doing
[28:55] which is easy and and not technical is
[28:58] now I've set up a PO Box so all of my
[29:00] post no no no post comes to my house I
[29:03] never give out my address anymore um and
[29:06] the second thing is stop using the same
[29:08] email address with my name on it for
[29:10] everything right start setting up like
[29:12] remailers and and different emails and
[29:14] give different emails or even temporary
[29:16] emails to all of these places that you
[29:18] shop and just think you know I think
[29:21] it's imposs you're never going to be
[29:22] Satoshi right and completely vanish from
[29:24] the internet but you can definitely make
[29:26] yourself harder to follow and harder to
[29:29] find and I wish I'd have taken that a
[29:32] lot more seriously up front and going
[29:35] forward I'm going to be looking a lot
[29:37] more seriously at non kyc options to buy
[29:40] the Bitcoin in the first place so
[29:44] they're not perfect right and they're a
[29:45] little inconvenient compared to using a
[29:48] kyc exchange but you know there's Robo
[29:50] sets there's bis Network there are
[29:53] options there's peer-to-peer there's
[29:55] earning it there's mining it um all
[29:58] right you might not be a competitive
[29:59] minor but would you pay a premium for
[30:01] pristine virgin Bitcoin that that that's
[30:04] never been touched by anyone else and
[30:06] has no no chain behind it maybe it's
[30:08] worth the premium so yeah just
[30:11] rethinking that that whole
[30:14] situation yeah I mean this whole thing
[30:17] is going to force force the world to
[30:19] become a bit more knowledgeable and
[30:22] responsible with regards to it you know
[30:24] like this this is technology this is
[30:26] Bitcoin isch technology and a lot of
[30:28] folks are still not comfortable you know
[30:30] on a computer let alone picking out good
[30:32] habits with regards to being safe online
[30:36] um a lot of the things a lot of the
[30:38] simple things you know that I still see
[30:40] all over the place are people just
[30:42] randomly and blindly connecting to Wi-Fi
[30:44] spots whenever they see them for the
[30:46] sake of being online this must be the
[30:49] most suicidal move anyone can make
[30:52] because if you knew how easy it was to
[30:55] set up Rogue access points that are
[30:59] named identical to commonly known Wi-Fi
[31:03] spots you'd freak out you you'd never
[31:05] connect to anything outside your
[31:08] home so that's how easy it is or when
[31:11] you know you have folks plugging in
[31:13] devices to charge them in public places
[31:15] like whether it's in airports whether
[31:17] it's on a plane whether it's it's in
[31:19] taxi cabs you know I see this all the
[31:21] time and it blows my mind I'm like what
[31:22] are you doing they're like I'm charging
[31:24] my phone like but how do you know this
[31:26] is a safe
[31:28] you know and then they go
[31:30] blank you see like things may seem
[31:33] normal and this is where the most
[31:35] elaborate attacks take place is by
[31:38] giving you the impression that
[31:40] everything there's nothing special going
[31:43] on and that's where you get screwed you
[31:46] know because if somebody's focusing on
[31:48] you specifically knowing you own
[31:50] hypothetically I don't know 25
[31:53] Bitcoin then they would if if you're
[31:55] likely going to be a target of this
[31:56] person this is is somebody's going to
[31:57] study you from morning to night they're
[31:59] going to know your patterns your habits
[32:01] where you go how often you go there and
[32:03] what's your routine so putting things in
[32:08] your path you know after having studied
[32:11] your morning itinerary at some point
[32:13] that you may not even think twice about
[32:16] but that somehow knock information off
[32:19] of you that's usually how these attacks
[32:22] happen because you're you come home
[32:24] wondering I didn't speak to anyone I
[32:27] been do and you think what the hell
[32:28] happened how could it possibly have
[32:29] taken place but then if you think back
[32:32] well you know I sat out of Starbucks and
[32:34] maybe I connected to a hotel Wi-Fi or
[32:36] maybe I did this or maybe I did that
[32:38] something like a very innocent move but
[32:41] because you were targeted the elements
[32:44] were put for you ready for you to land
[32:48] and use you know like I I remember we
[32:51] used to do this in University as a as an
[32:53] experiment we set up Rogue USB reports
[32:57] all over
[33:01] campus and all day long they were full
[33:04] full like we had databases of like if
[33:07] you knew what information we collected
[33:09] back in back in school you'd freak out
[33:13] and when we made it
[33:15] known people like panicked for about 5
[33:18] 10 minutes and then half an hour later
[33:20] they went back to plugging back into the
[33:22] same
[33:23] ports do you understand like
[33:27] you you have to get to a point where you
[33:30] snap out of your stupidity and you start
[33:32] taking certain things seriously because
[33:36] at some point your turn will come and
[33:38] you are going to get somehow so
[33:41] the idea is to prevent this not to take
[33:44] action after you've gotten the
[33:47] idea is never to put yourself in that
[33:49] predicament to begin with but yes it
[33:51] involves learning new things it involves
[33:54] developing better habits you know it's
[33:56] it's it's effort proof of work you have
[33:58] to do the work you can't expect to
[34:00] miraculously be a cyber security expert
[34:03] knowing all the good habits that are out
[34:05] there if you don't listen to anyone or
[34:08] don't spend five minutes learning
[34:10] something new that that that you know
[34:12] benefits
[34:13] you Bitcoin is going to change that in
[34:15] my opinion because now you have two
[34:18] choices you either use government
[34:21] money that enslaves you or you have
[34:23] freedom money which is Bitcoin but if
[34:26] you're going to use the Bitcoin the
[34:27] freedom money you better know how to
[34:29] take care of it otherwise you are
[34:31] absolutely going to lose it so pick
[34:35] which which which direction do you want
[34:36] to go and this is where look this camera
[34:39] is doing all these funny effects sorry
[34:41] about
[34:43] that I don't know I'm not I'm not sure
[34:45] how to turn this thing off I thought I
[34:47] did but it keeps coming back on um so it
[34:50] forces you to be more responsible you
[34:53] know with with with regards to your
[34:54] money initially but at the same time
[34:57] all the same habits that you're picking
[34:59] up to protect your money apply to
[35:01] anything about you
[35:02] online so your your suggestions about
[35:05] using aliases for email setting up
[35:07] private emails don't use your bloody
[35:09] name everywhere you you sign up you know
[35:11] you use something else you know like
[35:15] simple things it doesn't even have to be
[35:17] complicated and you don't have to do
[35:19] everything at once security is a is a
[35:22] journey it's a progress you take it step
[35:24] by step so that you know it cement
[35:27] itself in your head and eventually it'll
[35:30] become something common that you do you
[35:34] know and I genuinely believe that this
[35:37] is this is what's going Bitcoin is going
[35:39] to force people to adopt these habits
[35:41] unfortunately though I have a feeling
[35:44] it's going to come after most people get
[35:46] taught a very nasty lesson because pain
[35:49] is often the best teacher if you're not
[35:52] affected by it you're not going to take
[35:53] it seriously whatever it's nothing it
[35:55] won't happen to me until you wake up one
[35:57] day and it did does happen to you and
[35:59] then then you're then you're crying and
[36:02] sometimes you come out of it but a lot
[36:04] of times you don't depending on how hard
[36:06] that hit was the reason I reached out to
[36:09] youi just that I don't think I've ever
[36:11] told you this before but the main reason
[36:13] I reached out to you is because I was
[36:15] worried about
[36:16] you I saw the destruction of of life
[36:21] savings being wiped out in in front of
[36:24] my eyes to an entire country MH okay
[36:28] people don't usually come out of
[36:29] something like this the rate of suicide
[36:32] and dark thoughts that I have witnessed
[36:35] sometimes I wish I can unsee all of them
[36:37] but I can't and it haunts me so when I
[36:40] heard about your story 25 Bitcoin and
[36:42] how you were going on about it my main
[36:44] concern holy man I better call this
[36:47] guy before he does something he's going
[36:49] to regret that's why I reached out to
[36:51] you
[36:52] primarily then finding out maybe
[36:55] something we can help about bit that was
[36:57] secondary I needed to make sure you were
[36:59] in a proper mindset head space not to do
[37:02] something
[37:03] stupid sure I mean you know the good
[37:06] news and and and look everyone everyone
[37:08] uh reacts differently to to hardship in
[37:11] life right I think I think weirdly
[37:14] holding Bitcoin for 10 years made me
[37:16] more resilient and maybe resilient
[37:18] enough to deal with this because you
[37:20] know every single bare Market that
[37:23] everyone else you know has their
[37:24] pants on don't forget I've been through
[37:26] sort of three of those and and seen you
[37:29] know okay my paper net worth fluctuate a
[37:31] lot I think that was almost like a bit
[37:33] of preparation for for for this
[37:36] situation and and the thing that keeps
[37:37] me strong is that like I actually I owe
[37:40] it to a lot of people around me so you
[37:43] know my fiance my parents everything
[37:46] they've ever done for me throughout my
[37:48] life you know it's not acceptable for me
[37:51] to to take that easy way out and it's
[37:53] also not acceptable for me to become
[37:56] like a black hole of misery and doom
[37:59] because I'm only going to drag everyone
[38:00] else around me down with me so what I'd
[38:03] rather do is uh I don't know I'd like to
[38:07] make people proud of me because they
[38:09] think holy they just lost a million
[38:11] bucks and he still gets up every morning
[38:13] and and goes to bat you know I'd rather
[38:15] be that person than the former so that's
[38:17] what we're going to do it's it's it's
[38:19] difficult and it's tough and you know I
[38:21] would also Echo Tony's uh what Tony's
[38:24] saying right like if anyone out there is
[38:26] listen listening you know they might
[38:27] have experienced a hack and and and just
[38:30] kept it quiet out of embarrassment or or
[38:32] anything like that like if you find
[38:34] yourself in those shoes if you DM me and
[38:36] you want to jump on a call and have a
[38:38] chat for an hour or two I I I'm I'm here
[38:41] to do that and help you with that um
[38:44] even to the point like I don't I don't
[38:45] care like maybe you got hacked and lost
[38:47] all your ethereum right I mean I'm a
[38:49] Bitcoin Maxi but at this point if you're
[38:51] really facing hardship and you're you're
[38:53] really low let's just talk about it
[38:56] right like I'm not going to be an
[38:57]  because that's not my kind of
[38:59] coin but um yeah you know Tony's right
[39:03] like while I might seem okay at the
[39:05] moment and and and I'm confident I will
[39:07] be there are people out there that when
[39:09] this happens to them it's going to be
[39:11] too much of a heavy blow and that's why
[39:14] you know this this is so important that
[39:16] we get this right um so yeah yeah that's
[39:20] uh that's the the sort of experience of
[39:22] finding out and and I think the most
[39:24] important point is that's how KY
[39:27] contributed to our
[39:29] situation and uh man for for how how
[39:32] many decades have we been Outsourcing
[39:35] our information for the benefit of
[39:38] convenience it's become so ingrained in
[39:40] our culture and our way of life that
[39:42] it's going to be hard for a lot of
[39:44] people to turn 360 on that um you know
[39:47] I've learned the hard way and now my
[39:49] eyes are open I'm like okay I never have
[39:51] an Alexa in the house even my fridge
[39:54] might be listening to me um you know if
[39:57] I have a ring doorbell with a camera on
[39:59] it if someone gets hold of that they can
[40:01] see when I come in and when I leave my
[40:03] home all these sorts of things and you
[40:05] know what if I'm just using Alexa to
[40:07] turn the lights off I'm now with a
[40:09] mindset of I'd rather get off my lazy
[40:11] ass and just go to the light switch
[40:13] because I don't want all these attack
[40:15] surfaces uh around me now there might be
[40:17] people out there super talented with
[40:19] their privacy and and their security
[40:21] that they can have those things because
[40:22] they can mitigate the concerns but if
[40:24] you're not you know a a guy with 30
[40:27] years cyber security experience take
[40:30] some basic steps to to to you know like
[40:33] Tony says don't give out your email
[40:34] address everywhere don't give out your
[40:35] address everywhere use a PO Box there
[40:37] are things you can do that are
[40:39] non-technical just to get started that
[40:41] would would seriously increase your
[40:43] protection you
[40:45] know yeah it's it's a great point and
[40:49] now we covered so sort of the the kvc
[40:52] part and uh what happened next like you
[40:57] said there were a lot of points where
[40:58] you could have lost it and how did you
[41:02] actually what happened in the in the
[41:05] event so what what happened in the event
[41:08] is basically I I'll take you through the
[41:09] setup right because that'll help people
[41:11] understand a lot better
[41:13] so it's funny right because on Twitter I
[41:16] had loads of
[41:17] um I don't want to piss anyone off right
[41:20] but there's a lot of what I would call
[41:21] like sort of Wann toe Bitcoin advisers
[41:23] out there right who will give the advice
[41:25] that you have a hardware wallet and a
[41:27] steel plate and that's one and done and
[41:29] you don't need to think about anything
[41:31] else so I was getting quite funny
[41:33] comments on Twitter going oh you're such
[41:35] an idiot how do you not even know how to
[41:37] use a hardware wallet like that's some
[41:38] sort of Silver Bullet what people need
[41:41] to understand is we did have and we do
[41:43] use Hardware wallets but of course when
[41:46] you have a hardware wallet it's just a
[41:47] signing device so you know you also need
[41:50] to keep safe your recovery phrase right
[41:52] so if your Hardware wallet breaks or you
[41:54] lose it that you can get access back to
[41:57] your Bitcoin so ultimately you always
[41:59] end up in the place where you have a
[42:01] critical piece of data and you need to
[42:03] keep it secure and you need to be able
[42:05] to you know reach it and and keep it
[42:07] safe so the the real story is around
[42:10] what did we do with those recovery
[42:12] phrases and what were the decisions we
[42:15] made well the first thing that that we
[42:18] did was we used a password manager now
[42:21] before everybody freaks out and thinks
[42:23] hang on that's just using a third party
[42:25] I should be specific say that this is an
[42:27] open-source and self-hosted password
[42:30] manager called keypass which is a really
[42:33] respected piece of software like really
[42:35] good uh really good piece of software uh
[42:38] and and through no fault of that
[42:40] software did we get hacked right but
[42:42] that's where we stored our our our seed
[42:44] phrases now what's crucial to understand
[42:47] as well is that that keypass file was
[42:49] encrypted so it had a passphrase right
[42:52] and the passphrase only existed in our
[42:55] heads so it wasn't written down anywhere
[42:57] it wasn't stored digitally anywhere so
[42:59] you needed the password to access the
[43:01] file that had the the the seed phrases
[43:04] it mistake number one that I should
[43:06] highlight there is that this file is
[43:09] living on uh my dad's daily driver
[43:11] laptop you know he uses it every day to
[43:14] do his Tesco shopping and and all this
[43:16] other stuff uh so really really silly to
[43:19] have uh seed phrases even in an
[43:21] encrypted file on a laptop that's
[43:23] constantly connecting to the internet
[43:25] and interacting with loads of
[43:27] stuff the next problem you have is
[43:29] obviously like you know we we understood
[43:32] that having this file just on one device
[43:34] was also a risk because if the hard
[43:37] drive gets corrupted or he spills a some
[43:40] water on the laptop who knows if that
[43:42] file got corrupted we we we lose access
[43:45] to the Bitcoin so we wanted to make
[43:47] backups of it understandably right which
[43:50] leads us to mistake number two which is
[43:53] this keypass file was then backed up to
[43:55] the cloud
[43:56] so my dad's a a developer who uh you
[43:59] know he's is extremely techsavvy right
[44:01] and and he would re he regularly backs
[44:03] up his devices and takes uh what would
[44:06] he call them like snapshots of his
[44:08] devices so that all his work is saved he
[44:10] won't lose everything so it it kind of
[44:12] just ended up as part of his normal
[44:14] backup process right and this is where
[44:17] things went wrong you know essentially
[44:21] the the the cloud storage where the file
[44:23] lived and the file itself are both
[44:26] encrypted but the thing that tripped us
[44:28] up is that the P phrase used to encrypt
[44:31] those two things was laughably weak like
[44:35] really really bad you know it was about
[44:37] 11 characters long uh it wasn't Bitcoin
[44:41] as some people have guessed like the
[44:43] password wasn't Bitcoin it wasn't that
[44:45] bad it also wasn't the name of my dog or
[44:47] anything but it was laughably short it
[44:50] didn't have special characters uh and
[44:53] what we realize now is it would have
[44:56] been pretty pretty easy for someone
[44:58] capable to have brute forced this
[45:00] password so what we think happened and
[45:04] there's no guarantees right uh I can't
[45:06] prove any of this this is kind of
[45:08] following the most likely chain of
[45:09] events is that we think that uh you know
[45:13] my dad's email address in details were
[45:15] leaked from Mount goau attackers are now
[45:17] aware that there's a Honeypot of 25
[45:20] Bitcoin that's worth
[45:21] chasing his same email is connected to
[45:24] his Cloud account right right so now if
[45:27] you want to get into his cloud account
[45:28] you've already got his email the only
[45:30] missing piece is the password as I've
[45:32] explained the passwords really rubbish
[45:34] really weak so you know I'm not an
[45:37] expert in any of this stuff but from a
[45:39] bit of you know light Googling that I've
[45:41] been doing you know it could have been
[45:43] possible for some people to have brute
[45:44] forced this password in less than a day
[45:46] as far as I understand it right and if
[45:49] it's 25 Bitcoin you know maybe if it
[45:51] took them a month it's still worth
[45:53] trying to brute force that password so
[45:57] uh at the end of the day it was a weak
[45:58] pass phrase that let us down that let
[46:00] them a into the cloud storage and then B
[46:03] into the keypass file with the seeds in
[46:06] and once they've got that far that's it
[46:08] they can start moving the Bitcoin round
[46:11] so yeah you know obviously the lesson
[46:14] there is you know store your seed
[46:16] phrases online and
[46:18] um offline sorry St your C phrases
[46:22] offline um you know the the there are
[46:26] other potential theories right could
[46:28] there have been a key logger on my dad's
[46:30] device that watched him type in the pass
[46:33] phrase I I think that's highly unlikely
[46:37] the reason I think that's highly
[46:38] unlikely is that whilst my dad's not a
[46:40] cyber security expert he has been a
[46:43] developer for 50 years he really does
[46:45] know his way around computers I think
[46:47] it's extremely unlikely that he would
[46:50] ever fall for like a fishing scam or
[46:52] anything like that like he definitely
[46:53] knows better so I really do think they
[46:57] came in through the cloud account and I
[46:59] I think it's likely that the password
[47:00] was Brute Force because it only lived in
[47:03] our heads so it's either a key logger or
[47:06] it's Brute Force I think for a key
[47:08] logger they need malware or and we we
[47:11] ran malware scams or they'd need to have
[47:13] fished him which I think is low
[47:14] probability so that's our current best
[47:17] theory
[47:18] anyway um just just to chime in here
[47:21] Rick you mentioned all of this seemed to
[47:23] happen when you were in San Salvador
[47:25] right
[47:27] no so we discovered that the Bitcoin was
[47:30] gone whilst we were in San Salvador oh I
[47:34] had actually taken place on September
[47:37] 12th so unbeknownst to us we had lost
[47:41] the Bitcoin a month before we even
[47:43] discovered that it was gone now a lot of
[47:46] people find that kind of crazy but again
[47:48] to sort of help understand the context a
[47:50] little bit you know I would still use
[47:52] Bitcoin daytoday using different wallets
[47:55] and stuff like that like buying it
[47:56] selling it using it um but this was our
[48:00] long long longterm stack and it sat
[48:02] there for 10 years you know we don't
[48:04] check this thing every week we we're not
[48:06] keeping eyes on it I mean we should have
[48:08] had like a watch only wallet or you know
[48:10] there's things we could have done but to
[48:12] help people understand how we could have
[48:13] lost that and not noticed for so long
[48:16] simply because we weren't touching that
[48:18] and I and I genuinely mean this for
[48:20] probably another 20 years at least right
[48:22] like we we we were not giving up this
[48:25] Bitcoin um so yeah unfortunately I don't
[48:29] I don't think it has anything to do with
[48:30] us being in El Salvador at
[48:33] all okay yeah well it's it's definitely
[48:36] a plausible Theory I mean there's many
[48:38] ways this you know many many other
[48:40] possible roads this can go I mean you
[48:42] know I'm sure you're aware of um you
[48:45] know bad cables that you can potentially
[48:47] plug into your computer that you know
[48:50] seemingly do what they're supposed to do
[48:52] but at the same time are infected you
[48:53] know with remote web servers those are
[48:56] prevalent you know a lot more than you
[48:58] know people realize and I know because
[49:00] you know I've come across so many of
[49:02] them it's it's fascinating um you buy a
[49:05] USB cable you know it looks exactly like
[49:07] the one you have you plug it to charge
[49:08] your phone yes it does charge your phone
[49:11] but whatever you plug it into it's like
[49:13] it's a full access to that device you
[49:15] know everything and that's where key
[49:17] loggers usually hide you know when it
[49:20] comes to accessories of that sort so
[49:23] that could be I don't know I'm not
[49:24] saying this is your case but I mean if
[49:26] you think back you any any detail any
[49:29] small insignificant detail you know
[49:31] could potentially be a key to to this
[49:34] puzzle because you know when you when
[49:35] you work in cyber security there's no
[49:37] such thing as ah it's it's it's too
[49:40] stupid of a theory you know everything
[49:42] is a possibility because that's where
[49:44] the most creative attacks usually come
[49:46] from is again making it seem like as if
[49:48] nothing is wrong but this is where you
[49:51] know these are the most dangerous types
[49:53] of situations to find yourself in yeah
[49:56] and now now that we got some some hints
[49:59] that what could have happened what a lot
[50:02] of things the for people listening that
[50:05] actually can be avoided like not storing
[50:08] it
[50:09] online uh and things like that like
[50:12] what's sort of uh the best setup for for
[50:17] for people listening like self custody
[50:20] steel wallet do you have any
[50:21] recommendations in in that regard well
[50:24] there's no best setup there's this
[50:26] theory of that I have the best setup is
[50:28] nonsense the best setup is what works
[50:31] best for you in the sense that you have
[50:33] to find a balance between you know the
[50:35] security but the usability at the same
[50:37] time you know like you don't want to end
[50:39] up in a situation where you create
[50:40] something so complex like such a such a
[50:43] Draconian maze that it locks you out of
[50:45] it or you forget your way you know in in
[50:47] and out of that maze then that's even
[50:49] worse than losing your Bitcoin because
[50:51] you're just staring at it on a screen
[50:53] knowing you can't access it anymore
[50:54] because of something that you've done so
[50:57] you don't want to be in a predicament
[50:59] you know some some good habits like you
[51:00] said Rick N none of them have to be
[51:02] technical for one keep your mouth shut
[51:05] don't advertise what you're doing you
[51:07] know don't advertise what you're doing
[51:08] don't advertise what you have don't brag
[51:11] you know like I mean if you want to
[51:13] bring unnecessary attention to you well
[51:15] well then you know you're going to live
[51:16] with the consequences of that moronic
[51:18] decision don't do it that's for starters
[51:20] that's not a technical thing that's just
[51:22] a common sense um uh you know solution
[51:25] second second of all you know be aware
[51:28] of everything and anything that you're
[51:30] doing online like learn what it is that
[51:32] you're doing on that computer rather
[51:34] than just blindly click click click
[51:35] click click click all over the place you
[51:37] know when it comes to bitcoin there are
[51:40] a certain set of steps that you can take
[51:42] you know as sort of like foundational
[51:44] steps seat phrase if you're not a
[51:46] technical person the seat phrase what
[51:48] 100% categorically needs to remain
[51:50] offline no matter what that's for sure
[51:52] you know if you're somehow some sort of
[51:54] like an advanced it expert that's
[51:56] religiously disciplined about how you do
[51:59] things and what you plug into your
[52:00] computer and you have eyes on this stuff
[52:02] 24/7 then yeah maybe you can somehow get
[52:04] creative by saving it online but that's
[52:06] not for everyone it's definitely not
[52:08] something I would recommend anyone
[52:09] venturing unless you really know what
[52:11] you're doing uh keep you know if you're
[52:14] using p phrases they're recommended use
[52:16] them keep them in separate locations
[52:17] don't put everything in one place but
[52:20] again if you're going to be using
[52:21] Geographic you know uh displacements
[52:23] make sure you have access to these plac
[52:25] in cases of emergencies you know so many
[52:28] times I've I've come across folks where
[52:30] you know they've spread out their
[52:31] signing devices in like 17 different
[52:33] cities but then when something goes
[52:35] wrong they can't access any of them you
[52:37] know like that's that that that's also a
[52:39] problem that you need to think of or if
[52:41] there's somebody guarding you know those
[52:42] signing devices at some specific
[52:44] location what if they stop talking to
[52:46] you for what for whatever reason someday
[52:48] what do you do then you have a problem
[52:50] again it's not a technical one but it's
[52:51] a big problem that gets in the way of
[52:53] you and your coins so so all of these
[52:55] little details I mean these are the
[52:57] these are this is why there's no such
[52:58] thing as a perfect solution when we
[53:00] consult when I sit down and consult with
[53:02] someone I ask them like 700 questions
[53:04] just so that you know we can we can sort
[53:05] of assess The Sweet Spot between what
[53:08] they can do and what's actually you know
[53:12] secure at the same time and that's how
[53:15] we come up with a solution that's unique
[53:17] to each individual that nobody knows
[53:19] about that's the key there's no
[53:21] off-the-shelf solution here so if
[53:23] anybody wants to attempt an attack
[53:25] Vector on someone they will fail because
[53:28] you know there's something about you
[53:30] that is different from the next person
[53:31] and the next person and what have you
[53:33] this is how you you uh you develop good
[53:36] cyber security you know habits you know
[53:39] being as close as possible to a ghost is
[53:42] is the objective here so you know
[53:46] there's and again it's a progression you
[53:47] don't have to do this you know all in
[53:50] one shot it's not scary it's not
[53:52] overwhelming it's very easy you know
[53:55] there are people out there that'll
[53:57] explain it to you we're one we're just
[53:58] one of them there are many of resources
[54:00] that are free online if you don't want
[54:02] to consult with someone but you need to
[54:04] sit down do the work pay attention you
[54:06] know take notes study it learn it in the
[54:08] same way you learned how to drive a car
[54:10] in the same way you learned how to do
[54:12] many things that you take for granted
[54:13] now you have to sit down do the work to
[54:16] get to the result and when it comes to
[54:19] protecting your money it needs to be
[54:21] your number one priority in my opinion
[54:23] if you have any plans of living a free
[54:26] and dignified life for you and your
[54:28] family at any point in the future that's
[54:31] a great way
[54:33] um I think we covered the event now
[54:37] really good we covered the pitfalls we
[54:39] covered uh what we can do uh in case
[54:43] someone wants to be safe um Rick is
[54:46] there anything before we wrap up the
[54:48] podcast you want to
[54:51] add yeah I I think so I think I think
[54:54] you know what I want to say is that you
[54:56] know I've been around for a long time in
[54:58] the space so I've watched most things
[55:00] play out um you know I'm not a Galaxy
[55:04] brain uh sort of shadowy supercoder but
[55:07] I've learned a few things along the way
[55:09] right so I want to give people a little
[55:11] M context right bear in mind that I
[55:13] would say my dad is a a very capable and
[55:16] Technical person you know he's used all
[55:17] these programming languages he's a
[55:19] developer he's the kind of guy I've seen
[55:21] him take a an air conditioning unit off
[55:23] the wall cuz it's broken he takes it
[55:25] apart he gets his soldering iron out and
[55:27] he fixes it himself this is a guy who's
[55:29] very capable however he would also be
[55:33] the first to say that whilst he's a very
[55:35] good
[55:35] developer he is not a cyber security
[55:38] specialist this is a this is a niche
[55:41] specialism within computer science right
[55:44] and and he's quite capable and we've
[55:46] used Bitcoin a lot over the years you
[55:48] know I've run lightning nodes uh you
[55:50] know I've played with Ln bits and Ln URL
[55:53] with draw codes at meta s uh I know how
[55:56] to use replace by fee I've dabbled with
[55:59] coin joins um but here's the reality is
[56:02] like that is not our specialist field so
[56:05] a couple of things number one when I was
[56:07] playing with coin joins and replaced by
[56:09] fee I was doing it like it was a
[56:11] curiosity like a bit of fun I wasn't
[56:14] coming at it like yo I'm training for a
[56:17] boxing match and it's in three weeks and
[56:19] I I need to get you know really good at
[56:22] this this isn't just like a fun little
[56:23] game and the second thing I'd say is
[56:27] look I I I don't think what I'm trying
[56:29] to when I say that I think people should
[56:32] work with advisers on this stuff what
[56:35] I'm not saying is to completely
[56:36] Outsource the responsibility to someone
[56:39] else what I think is a better way to
[56:42] think about this is that you still need
[56:44] to go on this journey because ultimately
[56:46] the buck stops with you so you know you
[56:49] may work with Tony and he gets your
[56:51] security you know up to scratch but what
[56:54] if Tony's not around 15 years from now
[56:57] for you to talk to he's off doing
[56:59] something else right you ultimately it's
[57:02] always going to come back to you so when
[57:03] you work with an advisor the way you
[57:06] want to think of it is you know a lot of
[57:08] bitcoiners are very KY right like I
[57:10] don't want to work with anyone else I
[57:11] can do this all myself but ask yourself
[57:14] this question do you have 30 years
[57:17] experience in cyber security if the
[57:19] answer to that question is no then
[57:22] appreciate you're going to have to get
[57:23] better at it if you need to get better
[57:26] at it you can go and you can study
[57:28] there's loads of great tutorials you
[57:30] could go to bitcoin sessions is one that
[57:31] I love you know um you know that there's
[57:35] Arman on Twitter writes loads of great
[57:36] blogs there's loads of great information
[57:38] out there and you can do it yourself
[57:41] however if I wanted to get really good
[57:43] at golf right I love playing golf I get
[57:46] much better much more quickly when I
[57:49] have a coach uh if I wanted to learn uh
[57:53] any skill right look look at what rich
[57:55] and successful people do they hire in
[57:57] expertise where they have a gap and they
[58:00] fast forward their thinking when when
[58:02] Mark Zuckerberg decides he wants to be
[58:04] great at jiujitsu he didn't just go on
[58:06] YouTube he hires in all the experts that
[58:08] he can afford um you know think of it
[58:12] like that like you know I'm not a
[58:13] plumber so if my radiator falls off the
[58:15] wall yeah there's loads of Plumbing
[58:18] videos on YouTube but I call a plumber
[58:19] because he's got 25 years experience of
[58:22] fixing pipes and stuff so there's no
[58:24] shame in saying I'm not a cyber security
[58:27] expert but I want to train and because
[58:30] I'm training I want a really good coach
[58:32] it's like having a personal trainer um
[58:35] and you want to do this quickly because
[58:37] if bitcoin's about to 10x in price it
[58:39] might be six months might be six years
[58:40] from now who knows but I'm pretty
[58:43] confident it's going to continue to
[58:45] increase in value don't do what I did
[58:48] right make this investment before you
[58:52] get hilariously Rich right and I I know
[58:55] how other bitcoiners are thinking
[58:57] because I felt it myself for 10 years
[58:59] you think ah yeah but that costs money
[59:01] and maybe I'll just wait until after the
[59:03] bull run because my money will 10x and
[59:05] then I'll get my security
[59:08] sorted if I could go if I had a time
[59:10] machine Robin I'm sure you can
[59:12] appreciate I would go back uh in time to
[59:15] before the hack and I'd ring Tony up and
[59:17] I'd say Tony listen here's a blank check
[59:19] like this this I'm not going through
[59:21] that again let's get it done so everyone
[59:24] says the game is Buy and Hold no more
[59:27] than that buy hold and train train train
[59:32] continuously as well because part of the
[59:35] problem for us is that we never changed
[59:36] our setup over the 10 years if it ain't
[59:39] broke don't fix it we we we stopped we
[59:42] didn't go far enough and over the next
[59:45] 10 years the technology will get better
[59:47] Hardware wallets will get better new
[59:49] vulnerabilities will come out um you
[59:52] want someone in your corner that you can
[59:54] call up and that keeps you right uh so
[59:56] yeah for me it's a no-brainer um and
[59:59] that's why it's fun to to sort of go out
[60:01] there and and Tony's given me a platform
[60:03] to sort of say look this is what
[60:05] happened to me and here's a sensible
[60:07] destination you could go and speak to
[60:08] Tony and and and avoid my fate you know
[60:11] yeah you know I I'll I'll add one more
[60:13] thing here keep in mind that you know
[60:15] since this is technology and we already
[60:18] have like a my of problems online with
[60:20] regards to fishing scams and all this
[60:22] but there's one element you know
[60:24] everybody's aware of but they don't seem
[60:26] to be connecting the dots with and
[60:27] that's AI you know AI is not just a
[60:30] school Tech everybody's going to be
[60:32] using you know to improve their lives
[60:34] and to clone themselves and to do all
[60:35] sorts of like heroic activities AI is
[60:39] going to be used you know in attacks
[60:43] against people to steal from them and
[60:47] the more sophisticated these you know
[60:50] these tools become the less you are able
[60:53] to distinguish between between something
[60:55] real and something fake so if you
[60:58] already are like like get suckered into
[61:01] something now can you imagine how
[61:04] difficult it's going to be if you're not
[61:06] prepared when it becomes 10 times more
[61:10] elaborate to to Really distinguish
[61:12] between the two like these are all
[61:14] things you know like you need to think
[61:15] about you need to be prepared for there
[61:17] are solutions out there that protect you
[61:20] that use AI for the for the for the side
[61:22] of good not just for the side of bad bad
[61:24] you know so so to maintain a balance so
[61:26] you're not you know at the receiving end
[61:29] of all the negativity you're you're in a
[61:31] position where you have your defenses
[61:33] strong enough to protect against
[61:35] anything that can possibly come your way
[61:37] there are solutions out there we use
[61:39] them we have them we deploy them they
[61:42] exist you just need to want to sit down
[61:44] and learn about them because you're
[61:46] going to need them hopefully before you
[61:48] actually go through some you know life
[61:52] altering damage you know that's that's
[61:55] my hope I really like that one hour
[61:58] session now with with you guys it I
[62:00] think it shines a light on how important
[62:02] is to take it uh in your hand to take it
[62:04] seriously to take cyber security in
[62:07] general seriously but also take self-
[62:10] custody and securing your Bitcoin uh
[62:14] seriously and I think a lot of
[62:15] bitcoiners as you sric they thinking oh
[62:18] it's it's safe now and uh maybe now it's
[62:22] uh my Bitcoin stack isn't worth like
[62:25] maybe 10K and maybe then it goes over
[62:28] 100k then I invest some money like a I
[62:31] think a lot of Bitcoins actually think
[62:32] like that now and uh it's better to
[62:35] invest in in in in securing your Bitcoin
[62:38] safely
[62:41] before it it it happened and I think
[62:43] this story and that's that's why I I was
[62:46] reaching out to you so quickly when I
[62:48] saw you also joined the Bitcoin way um
[62:52] to to tell this story and make it it
[62:54] clear to everybody that it's really
[62:56] important to um take it seriously um we
[63:00] having an end routine at the uh at the
[63:03] Bitcoin podcast where the previous guest
[63:07] asked question for the next guest and uh
[63:11] I made an small alteration to that end
[63:14] routine but uh but the first thing I
[63:18] want to ask um maybe the both of you
[63:21] what Innovations on top of the base
[63:24] layer uh of Bitcoin are you looking
[63:26] forward the most layer two layer three
[63:28] solutions like this is a question that
[63:30] came from the the previous
[63:33] guest I'm hoping to see more privacy on
[63:37] on by default on bitcoin you know
[63:39] something that's probably going to be
[63:41] developed layer two layer layer three
[63:43] but has to be you know native Native to
[63:45] native to the system nothing that has
[63:47] people have to go out of their way to to
[63:50] activate to use to you know to to take
[63:52] advantage of it needs to be you know
[63:54] inherent to whatever application
[63:56] whatever system that you know being used
[64:00] that's what I'd like to see so that
[64:01] people don't have to worry about it and
[64:03] more importantly don't have to be feel
[64:05] guilty that they're keeping their stuff
[64:07] private because they're somehow you know
[64:09] being stereotyped as criminals because
[64:12] they decide to keep their private
[64:13] information to
[64:15] themselves that that's what I'm looking
[64:17] forward
[64:19] to yeah I I'd Echo similar to that I
[64:21] mean the stuff that that really excites
[64:23] me it's kind of funny right because the
[64:25] attacker used coin joins and and mixing
[64:28] technology to to hide our funds and and
[64:31] abscond with them right so you might
[64:32] think that I would sit here and say I
[64:34] hate mixing and it's wrong and let's kyc
[64:37] everyone but actually no th those are
[64:39] the technologies that that that excite
[64:41] me the most you know and and I want to
[64:43] give a big shout out again to Samurai
[64:45] wallet and and Ergo BTC and those guys
[64:48] because you know I know I know I know on
[64:50] Twitter they they seem quite prickly
[64:52] right and and they they're they're very
[64:54] very um very forthright with their
[64:56] opinions right which is something I
[64:58] actually quite appreciate um but I know
[65:00] it might put some people off and I would
[65:02] just say like understand that I think
[65:04] these guys are fighting the good fight
[65:06] and and they do it they do it against
[65:09] immense pressure right like all this
[65:10] chainalysis stuff um you know there's a
[65:13] lot of people who wouldn't want them to
[65:14] succeed but if we don't if we don't have
[65:17] privacy on
[65:19] bitcoin I I see problems further down
[65:22] the road and I think you know it's the
[65:24] those kind of guys that that are going
[65:25] to make the biggest difference um and
[65:28] other like other than that I think you
[65:29] know I'm excited to see if if layer 2os
[65:32] can get a little bit more robust uh
[65:35] especially you know the high fee
[65:36] environment at the moment you know for
[65:39] me I I want to see a world where
[65:41] everyone can use Bitcoin and have access
[65:43] to it but but I understand block space
[65:45] you know is limited and hey look you
[65:48] know I don't I don't have any of the
[65:49] answers for this but but I I I sincerely
[65:51] hope that that's something that we can
[65:53] solve to to keep Bitcoin as accessible
[65:56] and and
[65:58] permissionless as as as we possibly can
[66:01] um May maybe the layer twos can never be
[66:04] as decentralized as the layer ones but
[66:06] can they be a huge Improvement on on
[66:09] what fiat currency looks like yeah
[66:11] probably so yeah you know I'd love to
[66:14] see those things take off and and uh I
[66:16] think those those are the things we need
[66:18] badly yeah so I think it's also a really
[66:20] great way to end it and to to to make
[66:23] the podcasts here um uh where can people
[66:29] find you Rick uh also I think like ton
[66:32] is on on X you are also mostly on
[66:36] Twitter X however you want to call it

[66:50] using that as uh as my handle but you
[66:53] know I made that I made that 10 years
[66:55] ago uh you know what you might see from
[66:58] me in the future is that like I want to
[67:00] tell this story I'm going to go on a
[67:01] journey now of you know getting start n
