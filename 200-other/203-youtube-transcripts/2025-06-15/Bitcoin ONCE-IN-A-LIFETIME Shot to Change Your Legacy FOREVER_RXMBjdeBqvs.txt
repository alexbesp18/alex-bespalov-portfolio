[00:00] stay humble stack SATs this is
[00:02] generational the Bitcoin movement causes
[00:04] people to step back and think and
[00:06] question everything we're charging over
[00:08] $20,000 for the student to come to our
[00:10] school and the fair question is what's
[00:12] the value they're getting for coming
[00:13] into our school sitting here in this
[00:15] classroom are they're really getting
[00:17] that much better of an education than
[00:19] they could just from like a sailor
[00:21] Academy come with me on this little
[00:22] adventure of of Bitcoin you will start
[00:25] loving learning again you see it when
[00:27] you meet other bitcoiners we connect
[00:29] right away because what we all have in
[00:30] common is we're going through a personal
[00:32] Renaissance Bitcoin has come along and
[00:35] it's truth it's absolute and there's no
[00:38] changing it we're getting back to moral
[00:40] money money that can't be changed can't
[00:43] mess with
[00:44] [Music]
[00:48] it I'm writing a a piece of fiction it's
[00:52] going to be a three-book series it's
[00:53] basically a a Bitcoin SL Austrian
[00:56] economics principles book but so there's
[01:00] like the Tuttle Twins and there's
[01:02] there's you know there's all the
[01:03] technical books about Bitcoin that are
[01:07] but uh I'm a writer so my My overall
[01:11] book concept is something that parents
[01:14] could read their kids to for bedtime
[01:17] stories that age up up through kind
[01:21] of uh young
[01:23] adult and the concept is that it goes
[01:26] from the past to the present and then
[01:29] and within the book there's going to
[01:32] be
[01:34] secret sort of
[01:37] cryptography solutions that people can
[01:39] solve uh which will eventually result in
[01:42] a treasure hunt and the concept from my
[01:47] concept just in general was creating
[01:51] treasure hunts around the world for fun
[01:53] for family
[01:54] activities like uh they have murder
[01:57] mystery get togethers now I don't know
[02:00] if you've heard of those where you get
[02:01] together and you kind of open up the
[02:03] package and it's like okay this is the
[02:05] murder mystery like my my concept my
[02:07] idea is just use somebody like sat
[02:10] lantis or somebody who's kind of gone
[02:12] out and done you know grabbed all these
[02:14] bitcoiners around the world and in any
[02:16] City you could create a little Bitcoin
[02:19] treasure hunt from a distance even and
[02:22] then you could just make that a fun
[02:25] little thing and so then it's it's like
[02:28] a it's like a really big concept and I
[02:30] don't have it perfectly dialed down who
[02:33] knows if it'll ever happen but if you
[02:35] think that's worth talking about we
[02:37] could just you know goof around with
[02:41] that in terms of what would be a fun
[02:43] thing to get families out
[02:45] together around this idea of Bitcoin
[02:48] going on a little family treasure hunt
[02:51] um and could could we find the the
[02:53] Bitcoin in in the in the in the treasure
[02:55] hunt at the end and my idea would just I
[02:58] would just contribute
[03:01] Bitcoin as the treasure and then if like
[03:04] my little book sold then I just use the
[03:06] proceeds of the book to just add to the
[03:08] treasure so this could just be like an
[03:10] ongoing you know sort of refilling
[03:13] treasure um anyway I've got I've got
[03:16] some work to do on the concept but uh
[03:20] I'm I'm I'm I'm hesitant to throw it out
[03:21] there to a degree because I think it's
[03:24] cool and I don't want it to get ripped
[03:25] off but also like you know open source
[03:28] ideas and if guys can give me some
[03:31] better ideas or or say oh maybe you
[03:33] should do this or whatever so yeah I
[03:35] think it's it's always good if you have
[03:38] that open open source mindset um and I'm
[03:41] not afraid of of copycats uh even though
[03:45] it's it's it's always a danger it's also
[03:48] like I for example give everyone the
[03:50] podcast like no everyone can take
[03:54] whatever part of the podcast and use it
[03:56] even for commercial sense like I don't
[03:59] care uh I give it uh I don't have
[04:03] licenses on that you can chop it up you
[04:05] can do whatever you want and basically
[04:07] you can run and channel and make more
[04:09] money than I do uh but in the same time
[04:12] it's also marketing for me and stuff
[04:13] like that so I I really like that uh
[04:17] open source mindset it's kind of the
[04:18] satosi spirit where uh he just gave
[04:22] Bitcoin as a present to the world and
[04:25] didn't even take credit I mean we know
[04:27] satosi mot to um create it but the
[04:30] chances are very high that that's not
[04:32] his real name we don't know who he
[04:35] actually is but yeah it's like very very
[04:38] high chances that sados Nakamoto is not
[04:40] actually his real name so that's uh
[04:43] that's an interesting uh one so I I like
[04:46] that open source
[04:47] mentality when we create things yeah me
[04:51] too I do too yeah and at the last
[04:54] unconference did you go to unconference
[04:56] this time around or did you just get yes
[04:58] I it was amazing an conference uh it's
[05:01] my first ever un conference and I liked
[05:03] it a lot yeah yeah yeah so I was there
[05:05] too I got there late because um my first
[05:08] flight out of Denver got delayed but in
[05:11] the previous onc conference you know
[05:13] when we got in the line I just let
[05:14] everybody know hey I'm working on this
[05:17] Bitcoin pirate story pirate treasure
[05:20] story fictional idea so if anybody wants
[05:24] to uh just weigh in and give me any
[05:27] suggestions or ideas and and you know so
[05:30] the idea has been out there and I've let
[05:31] people know but I've been taking care of
[05:34] a a widow who passed
[05:36] away last year so I had to settle in
[05:39] estate and I and I'm and I'm you know
[05:41] raising a family and everything like
[05:42] that but now I'm down to one kid at home
[05:44] so finally I'm thinking like okay I got
[05:46] time I got some time to do some creative
[05:48] work because uh I find writing writing a
[05:51] book you know it's that deep work
[05:54] concept that um you ever read or seen
[05:57] Cal Newport heard of him at all he's got
[05:59] a he's got a great book called Deep work
[06:01] and it's just a reminder of what it
[06:03] takes to do some heavy lifting and and
[06:05] get some real work done and obviously
[06:07] it's like get get all your devices and
[06:10] all your distractions away from you and
[06:11] just kind of go into this deep workflow
[06:13] State absolutely I think we can directly
[06:16] start in with that um H H how do you
[06:18] make sure that um when you teach those
[06:22] principles with badtime stories to uh to
[06:26] the kids that parents can read um it's I
[06:29] think it's it's very hard to do that
[06:31] when you have complex problems like the
[06:33] the Fiat system and how how Bitcoin
[06:35] Works in a economics and what the
[06:37] problem with national depth and all
[06:39] those things is and you kind of try to
[06:41] do this and make it digestable for kids
[06:45] that that's what you're trying to do
[06:46] that I think that's like really hard
[06:48] hard thing to do to to make it easy to
[06:51] understand but not miss out on on
[06:52] details yeah I think that's one of the
[06:54] primary jobs of a teacher right is to
[06:56] take complex topic or theme be able to
[06:59] dig Gest it as the practitioner the one
[07:02] who really understands it and then
[07:04] resynthesize it reinterpret it and and
[07:07] bring it out to somebody else in a way
[07:09] that they can understand it you know the
[07:10] end conference is great because we had
[07:12] you know several people talking from
[07:15] different pedagogical theories and modes
[07:18] story just in general story and
[07:20] analogies are especially powerful for
[07:24] for understanding Bitcoin and um but at
[07:27] the end of the day you know people
[07:29] understand
[07:30] it's pretty easy to understand Good Guys
[07:32] bad guys theft like sneaky theft is also
[07:36] uh I think you know as as you're telling
[07:39] a story to a
[07:40] child you don't have to say and now
[07:43] listen here's the bad guy and see what
[07:46] he's doing he's going to do some sneaky
[07:48] theft you just you just show that sneaky
[07:51] theft as it
[07:52] unwinds and and you eventually over time
[07:56] reveal oh look this this guy appeared to
[07:58] be the good guy but he was actually the
[08:00] bad guy and you see how he was sneaky
[08:03] and um yeah so in in writing that story
[08:06] as I write it my my main goal is to not
[08:09] get pedantic and preachy and and you
[08:13] know kind of have like little narrative
[08:14] chunks and then suddenly this like three
[08:18] three page long you know white paper in
[08:21] the middle of the of the book you know
[08:23] you can't have that you're right so it's
[08:25] a bit of an art form for sure and uh
[08:29] I've got a pretty cool deal because I'm
[08:31] a I'm a full-time teacher I'm also
[08:32] Father I've got a bunch of little nieces
[08:35] and nephews as my test market so I'll
[08:38] just be reading this to them in class
[08:41] seeing if if my you know 13 14 year old
[08:45] students 15-year-old students uh enjoy
[08:48] it follow the plot see see the benefit
[08:50] but also are catching the underlining
[08:51] meeting and I'll just kind of I'll just
[08:53] do re iterations until it feels right
[08:57] what what are you teaching in in class
[08:59] besides Bitcoin here and
[09:01] there yeah so so uh just a little bit of
[09:04] my background I was a
[09:07] um was it I was uh I was thinking I was
[09:10] going to be an international lawyer I
[09:12] came to Germany and learned Germany
[09:14] German for a year when I was a junior in
[09:15] college my mom had a stroke so I came
[09:18] back to the US and switched Majors uh to
[09:21] English and then I became an English
[09:23] teacher in my 20s uh then I left got a
[09:26] master's in business and became a money
[09:28] manager uh and then shortly not shortly
[09:31] but about six years later I realized I
[09:34] was ready to go out on my own but I had
[09:35] a twoyear
[09:37] non-compete um I think you're familiar
[09:39] with these terms on non-compete so I I
[09:41] couldn't practice money management
[09:43] within a I think it's like a 50 mile
[09:45] radius of where I lived for two years
[09:47] right so friend of mine who was teaching
[09:49] still called me and said hey you know
[09:51] you should look at this school uh to
[09:53] serve out you're non compete so I went
[09:55] and started working it's this little
[09:58] Valor Valor Christian High School um
[10:01] they had somebody for business already
[10:03] uh but they needed English so for about
[10:06] 13 years I was the I I've been in the
[10:09] English Department and I was the head of
[10:11] the department for a while that's that's
[10:13] all the books you know actually this is
[10:15] my old book collection which is is
[10:17] really cool but you know I've got my my
[10:19] my actual books that I teach right here
[10:22] uh a couple years ago I just thought I'd
[10:23] retire but my boss was like hey what
[10:25] about teaching uh on the business side
[10:28] of things cuz she knew I had had a uh a
[10:30] money management firm on the side that I
[10:33] had started after my two-year non compet
[10:36] round down so I'm I'm I'm very very
[10:40] bipolar I've got a simultaneous career
[10:44] as an English teacher and a money
[10:46] manager and then that English teaching
[10:49] went away when I was going to retire and
[10:50] it got replaced with teaching business
[10:52] and Investments so uh this is my first
[10:55] year it's been full-time business but I
[10:57] teach two classes of advance business
[11:00] strategies uh two classes of
[11:02] fundamentals of Investments and an
[11:03] entrepreneurship class at a at a private
[11:06] Christian High School and um within the
[11:09] fundamentals of Investments class I've
[11:11] got I begin the whole class with a unit
[11:14] on on money and um that's just you
[11:18] know everybody in the finance world will
[11:21] will tell you yeah if if they went and
[11:23] got an NBA they never learned about
[11:24] money and and that's 100% right you jump
[11:27] in you get an NBA you think you know
[11:29] what you need to know Finance whatever
[11:31] then then Along Comes safety and moose
[11:34] writes a book about the history of money
[11:35] and somebody gives it to you and you
[11:36] pick it up and you read it and you think
[11:38] to
[11:38] yourself uh that would have been good to
[11:40] know that might have been a first
[11:42] principles thing that we should have
[11:44] started with so so that's how I start I
[11:47] start uh you know history of money gold
[11:50] standard uh all that
[11:52] stuff yeah it's interesting so so you're
[11:55] in a in a in a private school then it's
[11:58] a private yeah yeah um it seems like the
[12:04] especially when you look at the Bitcoin
[12:06] most parents are really against the
[12:09] public school system they try to home
[12:11] school as good as possible or a private
[12:13] school or some some alternative thing it
[12:16] makes you wonder like uh if if if the
[12:18] public school system is such a such a
[12:20] great idea is also with with your
[12:23] respective how do you see education
[12:26] developing over over the the run that we
[12:30] have now online universities basically
[12:33] like like sailor does with sailor
[12:35] University we have YouTube where you can
[12:37] basically look everything up but you
[12:38] have to do it on your own and and your
[12:40] own schedule we even have uh memes and
[12:44] homeschooling uh and and and other art
[12:47] forms of of getting a point across how
[12:50] do you see that developing in in the
[12:52] future well uh Robin it's it's a it's a
[12:55] fun time to be uh thinking about that
[12:58] because especially if you're I I don't
[13:01] know just overall I think the the
[13:04] Bitcoin movement causes people to step
[13:07] back and think and question everything
[13:09] that they've been you know it's it's
[13:12] it's like the Matrix and oh I'm on the
[13:14] other side like so so what other things
[13:17] and education's obviously a big one the
[13:19] the biblical you know this is a private
[13:21] Christian school and I'm operating from
[13:22] a Biblical uh worldview in this school
[13:25] and the biblical mandate to people
[13:29] raising kids is to raise a child
[13:31] according to their bent right so that's
[13:33] the term raise raise your child
[13:36] according to their bent and so as a
[13:39] parent um you know you're G to you're
[13:42] going to have a kid and you're going to
[13:44] bring them into the world and you're
[13:45] going to start paying attention to them
[13:46] and you're going to start thinking you
[13:47] know like how is this child behaving
[13:50] when you know certain inputs and you
[13:52] know how does this work and and you
[13:55] start looking and you start researching
[13:56] and you start thinking okay what's
[13:58] what's actually best for my for my child
[14:00] and a lot of times lot of times we
[14:02] didn't really think about that as much
[14:04] ourselves as we were going through the
[14:05] system it was pretty more or less uh
[14:09] industrial right with h the Dewey Dewey
[14:12] model of you know you're going to go to
[14:14] school and it's it's it's like a little
[14:16] conveyor belt and um we didn't really
[14:19] think about that much social social
[14:22] continuation just just you know don't
[14:25] don't make it too hard don't don't tell
[14:26] a kid he doesn't really know it and just
[14:28] promote him and
[14:30] and so what you have basically is you
[14:32] have federally funded
[14:34] daycare for you know up through 18 19
[14:38] years
[14:38] old and as a
[14:41] parent uh today you can just look at
[14:44] that federally funded daycare system and
[14:46] ask yourself you is this really the best
[14:48] for my kid if I've got options now what
[14:51] do I think about those options and and
[14:53] and not everybody has the same options
[14:55] you know in your area but uh you know
[14:58] online
[14:59] online's you know completely breaking
[15:02] that model um and then you have
[15:04] homeschooling and then you have private
[15:06] schooling and then there's still the the
[15:07] government School option and in some
[15:09] cases in some
[15:11] communities the the government schooling
[15:13] is actually still quite good and you're
[15:16] not you're not sitting there going oh my
[15:18] gosh I got to plug my nose every time I
[15:20] listen to this person talk because out
[15:22] of their mouth just comes pure idiocy no
[15:26] not at all like you I've got I've got
[15:28] plenty of friends they still teaching
[15:29] you government schools uh they're doing
[15:32] a great job but but by and large uh what
[15:35] you've realized is by and large most of
[15:37] the teachers and at least the states I
[15:39] can speak for the states they've gone to
[15:42] uh um sort of a government School
[15:45] they've G to into a into a system that's
[15:50] that's really not thinking
[15:52] about things from maybe more of a
[15:55] conservative point of view uh if if you
[15:57] have a strong religious belie beliefs
[15:59] you know certainly that public schooling
[16:01] isn't going to take those into
[16:02] consideration very much um and then
[16:05] you're just kind of vulnerable to to all
[16:08] the biases of the media and everything
[16:10] else and and if you're kind of outside
[16:11] that Matrix and you look what the public
[16:13] schools are teaching you realize oh
[16:14] these guys are just basically
[16:15] indoctrinating my my child in a in a
[16:19] worldview that I simply don't agree with
[16:22] in any way shape reform so then it's
[16:24] what what do I do about it um yeah so I
[16:27] think that's that's where where you
[16:29] start and and then and then from there
[16:32] you know what's my what's my child like
[16:34] and and then also there's other
[16:36] variables too right like so who's going
[16:37] to do this this homeschooling right is
[16:39] it going to be you is it going to be
[16:41] your spouse um does your you know
[16:45] there's I believe there's actually a
[16:46] gift of teaching I don't think
[16:48] everybody's equally as good of a teacher
[16:51] right like we all know we went through
[16:53] school and like had some teachers that
[16:55] were they had the magic and some don't
[16:58] what if what if you don't have the magic
[16:59] and neither does your spouse are you
[17:01] going to homeschool your child for the
[17:03] next 10 years and and and more or less
[17:07] sort of forfeit that opportunity for
[17:10] them sitting under teachers with the
[17:12] magic right so it's not an obvious I
[17:15] don't think it's an obvious decision but
[17:18] I always ask you know the teachers that
[17:19] I used to um man I'm not head of the
[17:22] department anymore but it's a fair
[17:24] question you know we're charging you
[17:27] know over $20,000
[17:29] for the student to come to our school
[17:32] and the fair question is well what's
[17:35] what's the value they're getting for for
[17:37] coming into our school and sitting here
[17:39] in this
[17:40] classroom uh you know are they really
[17:42] getting that much better of an education
[17:45] than they could just from like a sailor
[17:48] Academy or KH Academy if we don't have
[17:50] something happening in the
[17:53] classro that's more than just content
[17:56] dissemination right then we're not
[18:00] actually adding our values so um I I
[18:03] think you know on my side as an educator
[18:06] bringing those people together in that
[18:08] space that piece of it has to also be
[18:12] formative it can't just be well we're
[18:15] just sort of supervising them to make
[18:17] sure they don't get in trouble we have
[18:20] to do something with the dynamic that's
[18:22] happening there with the people together
[18:24] can that Dynamic happen
[18:26] online could could you and I jump on a
[18:29] zoom call and could I get 20 other
[18:31] students in the in the call as well and
[18:34] we still have that Dynamic maybe a
[18:36] little bit but probably not quite as
[18:38] good as we could with physical proximity
[18:41] so I'm just kind of I'm just I'm just ra
[18:44] rambling here for a while like re re
[18:46] redirect me uh do you need any anything
[18:49] from kind of what I've opened up so far
[18:52] oh yeah absolutely and it's super
[18:54] interesting especially the example that
[18:56] you brought up like you you pay for
[18:58] public school or public university
[19:00] sometimes uh big amounts sometimes the
[19:03] government pays that for you depending
[19:05] on where you live sometimes you have to
[19:07] pay directly uh and it's interesting
[19:09] because they're like online courses
[19:11] where you have to pay like 1,000 2,000
[19:13] EUR and usually like there's a high
[19:16] likelihood that like an online course is
[19:18] a scam but not all online courses are
[19:21] scams uh sometimes they're really good
[19:24] uh H but we are really quick to dismiss
[19:26] like an online course for a scam and now
[19:28] it's it's not that's not good for them
[19:30] and most of the cases that's actually
[19:32] true like on courses are a lot of there
[19:34] are a lot of scams involved in that but
[19:37] that then the public school system
[19:38] charges it so much uh and and doesn't
[19:41] maybe doesn't give you the same value
[19:43] for that H and you don't hear a lot of
[19:46] people saying oh that's a scam
[19:48] especially not in the in the mainstream
[19:49] maybe a little bit more in in Bitcoin so
[19:51] from from that perspective it's it's
[19:53] really interesting uh to look at okay
[19:56] what what does that school system cost
[19:58] me per semester per year per whatever uh
[20:02] is it actually giving me that value uh
[20:05] and then I I also asked one day on on
[20:07] Twitter um what did you if you went to
[20:11] University what is the main thing you
[20:14] took away from that and would you do it
[20:16] again and was it valuable for you and
[20:18] interesting enough most answers that
[20:22] said yes it was valuable most answered
[20:24] with the reason of uh Community uh I
[20:28] found a partner there
[20:30] friendship and only a very small
[20:33] percentage answered yes it was valuable
[20:36] and I liked what they like teached me
[20:38] and I got really good value what what
[20:41] actually I learned there most answered
[20:43] like yeah it was good I made good
[20:45] connections there I I learned my wife
[20:47] got the know my wife there and and and
[20:49] more the community aspect of it and less
[20:51] like what they learned so it kind of um
[20:54] it kind of strengthens that idea what IL
[20:57] musk is talking about like
[20:59] university is in most cases just
[21:01] basically for fun and for community and
[21:03] and less actually for for learning
[21:05] because we are so good now with with
[21:07] online and teachings but you also have
[21:10] to be the person for that so I think uh
[21:12] there's just persons that uh drive
[21:15] better with learning uh themselves for
[21:18] example I I I I I tried University two
[21:21] times uh and and dropped out in the
[21:25] first semester each one so like I tried
[21:27] one semester one thing and another M
[21:29] another thing and I just couldn't do it
[21:32] uh but I really thve and I just want
[21:34] want to go down a rabbit hole and then
[21:35] all of a sudden I'm like 20 hours per
[21:37] day and that rabbit and cannot think
[21:39] about anything else and go really deep
[21:42] um and other people I I met them they
[21:45] they just need a structure they they
[21:47] they don't want to uh go deep themselves
[21:50] they need a structured learning process
[21:51] so I think what we also have freedom has
[21:54] a lot to do with optionality uh and we
[21:57] have the most fre them if we have the
[21:59] private school the home schools the
[22:01] public schools if we if you can freely
[22:03] choose of uh what is best for us or what
[22:05] is best for our kids maybe uh so I think
[22:08] that's always the point I I come to and
[22:11] I don't know if we completely want to
[22:13] get rid of a public school system
[22:14] because it's a a good safety net I'm I'm
[22:17] not sure about that I know a lot of
[22:19] Libertarians a lot of um hardcore
[22:22] capitalists say we don't need the
[22:24] Department of Education I'm I'm I'm just
[22:27] really undecided on that one uh if we
[22:30] actually don't need it or if it's
[22:31] actually something good uh but I 100%
[22:34] agree it should not be mandatory and
[22:36] there are a lot of countries and states
[22:39] where it is mandatory you cannot even
[22:41] like you have to send your kids there
[22:42] which is crazy for me that is that's the
[22:44] thing yeah yeah yeah so you are a person
[22:48] whose bent is
[22:51] autodidacticism and you're you're going
[22:54] to educate yourself you're going to go
[22:55] down a rabbit hole and and you don't
[22:57] need in fact you even
[23:01] resist that that structure that form and
[23:04] as you're going through that form you're
[23:06] thinking this is all broken this is all
[23:07] weird I I just don't fit right so it's
[23:10] it's really about fit and customization
[23:13] and you know trying things and finding
[23:16] out okay and and I would say you know to
[23:20] create a lifelong learner should be one
[23:22] of the goals of every
[23:24] educator and so um there's there and
[23:27] there's a couple other things play there
[23:28] you know I've heard um so there's a a
[23:31] whole school of thought in the um in the
[23:35] homeschooling Movement by Charlotte
[23:37] Mason who's from uh from England and I
[23:40] actually saw there's a there's a
[23:41] Charlotte Mason School in Lin of all
[23:44] things called am amble side uh in in Lin
[23:47] so I thought I thought next time I get
[23:48] to Austria I'm gonna have to go by and
[23:50] visit that school wait in in my Lin in
[23:52] my austrin yeah yeah yeah yeah so so
[23:55] you're probably going wait what is what
[23:56] are you talking about this this guy
[23:57] knows a little private school in my in
[23:59] my L yeah yeah so what what is it called
[24:03] again how how do you spell it I it's
[24:06] called amble side do you find it amide
[24:09] online uh amble Side schools amid
[24:14] School uh Lind let see yeah you
[24:21] know is is IDE a brand name or is there
[24:24] like an a category uh like it's a it's
[24:27] the name of the school it's a brand name
[24:29] it's amberside International and oh here
[24:33] it is amberside school
[24:36] International uh there's oh wait wait
[24:40] why should I I can share the screen okay
[24:43] okay then then then you and the uh the
[24:47] audience don't have to guess what I'm
[24:49] looking at right now uh is is that the
[24:51] ample side that you're talking about ID
[24:54] School
[24:54] International yeah that's right so so
[24:57] you know my wife and I we heard about
[25:00] the homeschool Movement we looked into
[25:02] it uh we thought about it and and the
[25:05] more we thought about it we just
[25:06] realized you know she just really wasn't
[25:08] going to be a great homeschooling mom it
[25:10] was just going to you know she had a job
[25:12] anyway and she she was just like well
[25:15] what what's our what's our other options
[25:18] there it is yeah and uh you know my
[25:22] whole point to her was well if if we're
[25:24] going to spend money on a private school
[25:26] it's got to be significantly different
[25:28] it's got to be different enough to to
[25:30] make it worth the money and um we just
[25:33] we just found this school and completely
[25:36] fell in love with it and and you know
[25:38] they don't have grades uh students
[25:41] instead of getting grades they get a uh
[25:44] a narrative a report of growth it's
[25:46] about 10 pages long and and the teachers
[25:50] the teachers work like incessantly to
[25:54] truly know what your child is like and
[25:58] and so like you I found this school and
[26:00] I just thought man that's that's
[26:01] actually worth my money and so we've
[26:03] sent our kids through this
[26:05] school we just we just really love you
[26:08] know the emphasis is on learning at the
[26:10] school versus homework so the kids come
[26:13] home and they get to eat a meal with the
[26:14] family versus just come home and like
[26:17] now they're saddled with another three
[26:19] hours of homework kind of a thing and it
[26:21] was just a really sweet breath of fresh
[26:25] air it was it was still we you know
[26:29] it wasn't it wasn't homeschooling but it
[26:32] wasn't uh the government school and it
[26:34] was just like this sweet little spot
[26:36] smaller classes that you know you can't
[26:39] you can't uh just Pile in there and get
[26:41] a class of 30 and and uh this you this
[26:46] this has just been like our answer you
[26:47] know so so we've loved it and in our in
[26:50] our community it's it's K through 12
[26:52] they're just getting the high school
[26:54] going but I teach at a different uh
[26:55] school so my sons switch then when they
[26:57] get to high school and they come to my
[26:59] school but yeah so I I thought it was I
[27:02] thought it was neat that uh there's
[27:04] actually one in h Austria yeah I'm just
[27:07] looked at I'm amazed because it's like
[27:10] really uh there was my school that that
[27:12] I went there in
[27:14] in and so it's literally uh three
[27:19] kilometers like 40 minutes to walk away
[27:22] from each other so it's really not that
[27:23] far
[27:24] away wow wow what are the chances
[27:29] what what are the chances
[27:31] yeah yeah so so I don't I don't know
[27:35] sending their kids to that school or how
[27:36] they find that school in Austria but I
[27:39] promise you whoever is sending their
[27:41] kids to that school they've looked at
[27:43] the value proposition and they've
[27:44] thought to themselves this is this is a
[27:47] really
[27:48] good uh alternative to to whatever the
[27:51] other options there are and I I promise
[27:54] you they're very satisfied but it's just
[27:57] till 15 right it's like for for kids
[28:01] yeah it's foundational and and you know
[28:04] it's it's it's
[28:05] just just pedagogically they do things
[28:07] just a little bit differently and they
[28:09] really work on so for example what you
[28:11] go to an open house this isn't supposed
[28:13] to be an advertisement for the school
[28:15] but you go to an open house they have a
[28:16] kid sit down with you and and they read
[28:19] a passage from a book it's like fairly
[28:21] technical Biology book or something like
[28:24] that and then they just say hey so like
[28:26] why don't you just tell me back what you
[28:28] just heard and and out of the kid's
[28:30] mouth and this is this is like a a
[28:33] circus trick almost almost out of the
[28:35] kid's mouth they just tell you back
[28:38] almost
[28:39] verbatim What the person just read to
[28:41] them and then you realize oh that
[28:43] ability to listen and just lock down
[28:48] what they just heard that's a trained
[28:50] skill so a lot of times people say yeah
[28:52] we're going to teach students how to
[28:54] think and that they're not really
[28:56] teaching how students how to think but
[28:57] at this
[28:59] school they just have some some
[29:01] methodology and some practice that that
[29:04] uh you know they'll do mental math
[29:06] programs it's just a lot and like my
[29:08] kids would come home from school they
[29:10] would be tired they just work their head
[29:12] all day long and then no homework you
[29:14] know so it was it was pretty neat yeah
[29:17] it's also I think in the in the young
[29:19] age it's it's a lot about learning how
[29:21] to learn and and not not that much about
[29:25] like of course you you should learn how
[29:27] to ride you should learn some basic
[29:29] maths and stuff like that uh but uh it's
[29:31] a lot also about how do you actually go
[29:34] ahead and learn I struggle with that a
[29:35] lot I knew how to learn with like 17
[29:40] years old 18 years old that that's where
[29:42] I got my systems done uh because I
[29:45] struggle in school a lot uh and then
[29:48] kind of I think a swim coach of mine or
[29:50] something like that was like oh do you
[29:52] even know how to learn like do do you do
[29:54] you know do you have a structure process
[29:56] for did you find out how you can
[29:58] best get things in your
[30:01] head yeah and yeah and he was great and
[30:04] then and I never thought about that
[30:06] before and then with like 16 17 years
[30:08] old some somewhere around those lines I
[30:11] I I got down and just like sat down I
[30:13] was like okay you let's open YouTube how
[30:16] to learn then and then then like I just
[30:19] went down a rabbit hole and I tried
[30:22] different methods and it took me like
[30:23] half a year to find something that fits
[30:26] uh and from that moment on my grades
[30:29] went from like 45 to one 12 so 45 is the
[30:33] lowest and one 12 is the highest H so
[30:35] and the the learning time really uh
[30:39] shrinked a lot uh it's just like okay
[30:41] how do I get information in my head
[30:43] because a lot of the exams in in school
[30:46] at least in Austria uh you get I don't
[30:49] know 20 30 50 sometimes 100 pages of
[30:52] learning material uh and from there you
[30:55] just have to either understanding or
[30:58] learning it uh uh or learning it by
[31:01] heart and then you have an exam so you
[31:03] have to know that things by the exam uh
[31:06] and it took me some time to figure out
[31:08] how to learn and once I figured it out I
[31:10] didn't struggle in school I didn't have
[31:12] to be that much in school I was the one
[31:15] that was the least in the school I had
[31:17] like 200 missing hours every every year
[31:21] uh in in school but it still was one of
[31:23] the the better ones like everyone was in
[31:25] the higher third of of the class usually
[31:27] with with the grades just because I
[31:30] figured out how to learn and I think a
[31:31] lot of people never really figured out
[31:33] how how to learn and uh that that's
[31:36] that's a skill I think you should learn
[31:39] in school till you are like 15 16 uh at
[31:43] least uh and yeah I I got it a little
[31:45] late but I I got
[31:47] it yeah I mean trust me a lot of people
[31:50] don't ever get it but but but you know
[31:53] that's that's another it's another
[31:54] little phrase is is all education is
[31:57] self educ ation and so you know just
[32:00] think about that for a second if you're
[32:03] on an you know kind of an
[32:05] industrial you know I just I always
[32:07] think of a conveyor belt you know like
[32:08] year one year two year three just kind
[32:10] of like dragging you through this and
[32:12] it's it's all external and everybody's
[32:14] just trying to like throw stuff at you
[32:17] and you're just gonna like okay like you
[32:19] know like ver versus at some
[32:23] point right you catch something and you
[32:26] grab it and you go I caught it I've got
[32:28] it I wonder if I could do that with this
[32:30] else also and and and now you just have
[32:33] this kind of moment where you're sitting
[32:35] there going like and even with teachers
[32:37] you know I'll tell my students hey look
[32:40] you're going to have seven teachers this
[32:43] semester you're going to be coming and
[32:45] going in our rooms but they're teachers
[32:48] and name only until you sit there and
[32:50] look at them and go okay this guy or
[32:52] This Woman This is my true teacher like
[32:55] for you is almost like your swim coach
[32:57] you know you don't know where they come
[32:58] from but but who is that person who you
[33:01] realized oh I I will put myself beneath
[33:04] them in in a posture of humility and
[33:07] whatever comes out of their mouth I will
[33:10] listen to and I will think about and and
[33:13] and now I have a true teacher and now
[33:15] we're at a different entirely different
[33:17] level right so I'm just trying to teach
[33:21] my students don't don't be don't don't
[33:23] think that just because you get a
[33:25] diploma and you go through these years
[33:28] you're anywhere close to educated and
[33:30] you might not even had a single true
[33:32] teacher in all those years either if
[33:34] you've never submitted yourself to
[33:36] somebody's wisdom and
[33:38] experience and then the other thing I I
[33:41] say a lot of times is you know you were
[33:44] talking about um Elon Musk and you know
[33:47] and do we just go online and do we even
[33:50] need school it's just for fun and I
[33:52] think a nice way to think about that is
[33:54] formal and informal so so that's what
[33:57] I'll I teach seniors and they're about
[33:59] ready to pick a college and go off to
[34:00] college and and I just tell them you
[34:03] know uh I would pick your school as best
[34:06] as you
[34:07] can by the highest quality people you
[34:10] can surround yourself with because those
[34:13] people will consist your informal piece
[34:16] of the education and as you go through
[34:18] college especially because you're not
[34:20] with your parents you know you're having
[34:22] a identity crisis you know you're kind
[34:25] of leaving the nest and not who am I
[34:28] what do I really think and and if you
[34:30] can surround yourself with very quality
[34:34] like uh focused funloving you know alive
[34:39] you know fill in the blank of of of the
[34:41] kind of people that help you
[34:44] thrive if you don't find those people or
[34:46] if you find people that are the other
[34:48] way your entire informal education part
[34:51] of your education's going to wither and
[34:53] die um but if you do find those people
[34:57] then you can actually have a phenomenal
[34:59] informal
[35:00] education and I do think that that's you
[35:03] know looking back I happened to go to a
[35:07] really great college for that which
[35:10] resulted in me going to Germany for a
[35:12] year and just being surrounded with with
[35:14] peers that were eager to learn and also
[35:17] interested helped shape me and form me
[35:19] forever so that I could become somebody
[35:21] who's literally like over here teaching
[35:23] like English full-time and over here
[35:25] knowing the markets and managing
[35:27] people's money fulltime like how do you
[35:29] become a person that does that well you
[35:31] don't just like you know do that you you
[35:35] you work your way to that by having this
[35:37] very broad love of of learning all
[35:40] things right I partnered up with coin
[35:43] vigilante this is the most beautiful

[37:52] I almost see as you mentioned also
[37:54] before the lifelong journey I almost see
[37:56] like my pod almost as as learning now
[37:59] because I sit down with so many
[38:02] different people uh and obviously we
[38:04] talk a lot about one topic of Bitcoin
[38:06] but today for example we didn't talk a
[38:08] lot about Bitcoin till now uh and and
[38:11] it's it's it's great because I get to
[38:13] know so many things and I often say like
[38:16] my Bitcoin knowledge Grew From 12 months
[38:18] ago till
[38:20] now so huge like it was such a a steep
[38:24] learning curve but also in other areas
[38:27] uh I learned so much from my guests uh
[38:29] and it's basically for me going to
[38:32] University every day for one to two
[38:34] hours because I do it every day Monday
[38:37] to Sunday for one to for one to two
[38:40] hours uh the podcast and getting paid
[38:42] for doing that that that that's just uh
[38:46] that's just crazy for me when I when I
[38:48] go with that perspective and that
[38:50] mindset into that because I just get
[38:52] paid to learn from uh amazing people and
[38:54] as more as as as the podcast grows I
[38:57] actually get paid to learn from even
[38:59] better and better and better and bigger
[39:01] people uh and it's it's really
[39:03] interesting but I'm also really great uh
[39:06] even really big on getting people on
[39:09] that have never been on the podcast so I
[39:10] kind of try to get uh get get the widest
[39:14] range of of people on not only like I
[39:18] did that in the beginning just for
[39:20] myself but it turns out people really
[39:22] love that and whenever I meet people
[39:25] that watch my podcast in real life they
[39:27] always say to me they love the variety
[39:30] of guest that there is on uh it's just
[39:33] something that I wanted to do and not to
[39:36] talk with the same 20 people all over
[39:38] again no I think that's that's well
[39:41] understood like you you've gone from
[39:43] somebody who struggled to understand how
[39:46] you even learned to to really becoming a
[39:49] power educator with an educational
[39:52] platform that's infinitely
[39:54] scalable and and you know a podcast
[39:58] can't do what I can do with 20 kids in a
[40:01] room as far as a community and an
[40:03] atmosphere per se but at a different
[40:07] level every day you're create creating
[40:09] an
[40:10] atmosphere um and then then you know
[40:13] personal anecdote that was my entire you
[40:16] know I I I don't know how I heard about
[40:18] the Bitcoin standard but I did and and I
[40:20] read it and
[40:22] immediately the the the podcast world
[40:26] just like
[40:28] you know that that ability to once you
[40:31] find something that you want to learn
[40:32] about you can you can just dive deep and
[40:35] and I I explained to my students this
[40:38] was impossible you know when I when I
[40:40] was coming out of
[40:41] college we had no money my my background
[40:44] is we we just had no money and I wanted
[40:47] to learn about money and everything you
[40:49] had to you had to pay for everything and
[40:51] it was expensive and you had to
[40:53] subscribe to the Wall Street Journal and
[40:55] you had to teach yourself there were
[40:57] there were no podcasts interviewing
[40:59] billionaires explaining to you how the
[41:01] world worked and how to how to just make
[41:04] yourself financially free there were no
[41:07] like hours and hours of hey here's a
[41:09] good path this is a good way to go today
[41:12] there are today maybe there's the other
[41:14] problem of like where's the signal from
[41:15] the noise but but then and even even
[41:19] like like uh within the podcast world
[41:23] you you can you find different people
[41:25] with different Gifts of teaching uh in
[41:28] the podcast world and you know I I I'll
[41:31] listen to certain people podcasting I
[41:33] don't like say anybody's names but I
[41:37] like I'll listen to it for like a while
[41:38] and I like does this person even have a
[41:40] guest on their podcast you know like
[41:42] they're just like they just love to hear
[41:45] themselves
[41:47] talk and you know it's like okay well
[41:50] like that's great but I already know
[41:52] what you think and I've already heard
[41:53] everything you have to say and it's just
[41:54] like this versus you know really I think
[41:57] a really good like I just appreciate
[41:59] your your podcasting style because it's
[42:02] one of humility and it's one of true
[42:03] interest and
[42:04] genuine uh you know what can I what can
[42:08] I bring to my to my listeners that's
[42:10] something that they haven't already
[42:12] heard and and probably less of me than
[42:15] more of me is the better way to go you
[42:17] know interviewing these guys but yeah
[42:19] you're a power educator with a
[42:20] infinitely scalable platform so that's
[42:24] that's pretty that's pretty
[42:25] sweet never looked at me as an educator
[42:28] actually it's the first time ever that I
[42:30] heard that someone describing me as an
[42:32] educator I heard journalist I heard
[42:34] podcast H I heard so many different
[42:35] things but I never heard actually
[42:36] educator even though I yeah that that's
[42:39] kind of I I don't see myself as an
[42:41] educator because I'm just asking
[42:43] questions uh but with that I educate
[42:46] people that listen to those conversation
[42:47] yeah that makes makes a lot of sense
[42:50] yeah really cool yeah but like even just
[42:52] that question I mean that's a
[42:53] pedagogical method right and the
[42:55] Socratic method and let's just let's
[42:56] just follow that thread and let's
[42:58] question that out and and uh yeah I
[43:01] would say uh you know going back to if
[43:05] all education is self-educating think
[43:08] think about what's Happening Here is
[43:09] people are people are intentionally
[43:11] selecting to listen to your podcast so
[43:14] so you know uh maybe somebody's passed
[43:17] it on to them and it's just a suggestion
[43:19] but once they listen to one if they if
[43:20] they keep coming back you have you have
[43:23] pupils who've decided this person is
[43:26] going to be be my teacher at least at a
[43:29] certain level and I'm going to listen to
[43:31] what they have to say and I'll still
[43:33] think think over whether I agree or
[43:34] disagree with it but they've actually
[43:37] like maybe maybe not uh maybe not like
[43:41] saying that to themselves in their head
[43:43] subconsciously that's what they've done
[43:45] they've decided to make you their
[43:46] teacher yeah don't get a big head about
[43:52] that now now I can go back to school to
[43:55] my teachers and say hey I'm a teach know
[44:00] yeah it's it's interesting I even uh I
[44:03] spoke last time with my mom about that
[44:06] uh because in my school I was uh not
[44:09] really good in in German I was really
[44:11] bad in public speaking I got completely
[44:13] like red when I when I spoke in front of
[44:16] anyone I was really an introvert
[44:17] actually uh and uh basically was like ah
[44:22] Robin doesn't have to be a public
[44:24] speaker he can do something with Technic
[44:26] stuff like that so now I only do that
[44:29] and it was like I was not that small I
[44:31] was like 14 15 maybe uh even back then
[44:34] was not that in interesting so it's it's
[44:37] there can a lot there can be a lot of
[44:39] developments that you cannot foresee so
[44:41] even you saying to me like oh you're
[44:43] teacher that that that is something uh
[44:46] my early teachers uh would be interested
[44:50] to hear
[44:52] about yeah yeah no it's a little bit
[44:55] like this this
[44:57] uh you
[44:59] know I I think that's part of the
[45:01] Bitcoin story right this this personal
[45:03] transformational path and you know
[45:06] people always talking about like well
[45:07] how are you going to orange pill
[45:08] somebody and the answer for me is easy
[45:11] the answer for me is just like hey how
[45:13] would you like to have a a personal
[45:16] Renaissance in your life like wherever
[45:19] you're at in your
[45:21] life would you like to have a personal
[45:23] Renaissance are you feeling stale
[45:25] stagnant are you just going through the
[45:26] emotions
[45:28] if you come with me on this little
[45:29] adventure of of
[45:31] Bitcoin you will start loving learning
[45:34] again you will start learning broadly
[45:36] and deeply things you never imagined
[45:38] yourself
[45:40] being I'm I'm similar like in that I'm
[45:43] not technical in the least I've never
[45:45] been technical in my life well what do I
[45:47] have down in my basement like I just I
[45:49] got to start n I'm running a no you know
[45:52] like and I'm going to get the Alby set
[45:54] up and like that's just like so bizarre
[45:58] to me you know I know all the stuff
[45:59] about nuclear energy I know all this you
[46:02] know how did I come to know this well
[46:04] just here's Bitcoin as the Hub and
[46:07] there's all these spokes that are going
[46:08] off and kind of you know you can you can
[46:11] just go for you can just go as much as
[46:14] you like and you
[46:17] can and you see it you see it when you
[46:19] meet other bitcoiners I mean people like
[46:22] oh yeah we we we connect right away
[46:25] because we have uh like a freedom
[46:28] mentality or whatever but but yeah sure
[46:31] but but but beneath that is what we all
[46:34] have in common is we're going through a
[46:36] personal Renaissance and we're ending up
[46:38] somewhere that we never imagined we'd be
[46:40] and it's it's uh delightful it's could I
[46:45] could I this this is like a little pivot
[46:46] but could I just read a little passage
[46:48] of a book I just read the other day to
[46:50] you really quickly of course go ahead
[46:53] yeah so um you know lupan the the the
[46:56] Netflix movie it's it's a recent movie
[47:00] uh maybe you could call up on your
[47:03] screen what is it called Japan no l u p
[47:07] i n it's French it's it means wolf lupan
[47:11] and it's got this great actor uh I think
[47:14] his last name is dip I will try to find
[47:16] it quickly okay
[47:18] yeah easy to find it's
[47:25] Loop uh
[47:27] with and back Loop yeah l p i n oh
[47:33] yeah now I got it I think wait let me
[47:35] share it you seen this uh little
[47:39] show this this show yeah that's it this
[47:43] one this was a really fun little show
[47:45] that just uh yeah Omar I think the dup
[47:50] is is his name in the in the in the
[47:52] story that guy he's a great actor and
[47:55] the whole concept is that he's a
[47:56] gentleman Thief right and and then they
[47:58] go into the backstory about how he
[48:00] became a gentleman
[48:01] thief and and
[48:04] it's it's its sort of Bas layer is is is
[48:08] this character named arene
[48:11] lupan that was from from literature and
[48:14] and I was just like is this actually a
[48:17] thing because I'd never heard about it
[48:18] so I went and um explored it and it's
[48:22] actually real fiction and the guy wrote
[48:25] during Arthur Doyle's time of writing
[48:28] Sherlock Holmes so and it's hilarious
[48:31] too because uh he's he's writing about
[48:33] arcene lupan his his character and he
[48:36] brings Sherlock Holmes into the stories
[48:38] and apparently Arthur Coden Doyle didn't
[48:40] like that and threatened to sue him so
[48:43] so he changes the guy's name to herlock
[48:46] scholes instead of Sherlock Holmes but
[48:49] uh yeah it's just it's just it's a
[48:51] really great show but I've been reading
[48:54] the uh the underlying fiction that goes
[48:57] to it and uh flying out to El Salvador I
[49:01] was reading the book and I and I just
[49:02] read this passage this is what I'm going
[49:04] to read right now so it says uh the the
[49:07] background is the character saved this
[49:09] woman from an oppressive uncle and and a
[49:12] guy that was going to take advantage of
[49:13] her and he says uh you know uh are you
[49:16] satisfied with me he asked she gave him
[49:19] both of her hands you've saved me from
[49:20] Ros me you've given me back my freedom
[49:22] and my Independence I thank you from the
[49:23] bottom of my heart well that's not what
[49:25] I was asking to say he answered my first
[49:27] and Main object was to amuse you your
[49:29] life seemed so humdrum and lacking in
[49:32] the unexpected has it been so today how
[49:35] can you ask such a questions I've had
[49:36] the strangest and most string
[49:38] experiences that is life he said when
[49:41] one knows how to use one's eyes
[49:43] Adventure exists everywhere in the
[49:46] meanest Hubble under the mask of the
[49:48] wisest men everywhere if you're only
[49:50] willing you'll find the excuse for
[49:51] excitement for doing good for saving a
[49:54] victim for ending an injustice
[49:57] impressed by his power and authority she
[49:59] murmured who are you
[50:01] exactly an adventurer nothing more a
[50:05] lover of Adventures life's not worth
[50:08] living except in moments of Adventure
[50:10] The Adventures of others or personal
[50:12] Adventures I read I read that on my way
[50:14] to El Salvador I was like that is
[50:18] awesome that captures what bitcoiners
[50:21] are like engaged in uh and and it
[50:25] doesn't have to be exotic like a plane
[50:27] ride to El Salvador it can just be
[50:30] tomorrow night when I driving home and I
[50:33] plug in the podcast and I just start
[50:34] listening to Robin Sarah talking about
[50:37] something that I knew nothing about and
[50:39] I'm on this adventure I'm on this
[50:41] journey so thanks thanks for humoring me
[50:44] with a little reading that that's great
[50:48] I I like that I think we never had a
[50:50] reading on the podcast so after
[50:53] 317 uh episodes we have uh we we still
[50:57] have new things to discover we still
[50:59] have new things that that happen on the
[51:01] podcast uh I think what we also never
[51:03] did is watching a clip I don't know I
[51:06] think we actually never watched a clip
[51:08] uh once we wanted to watch the short
[51:11] Matrix clip but it didn't work so I
[51:14] couldn't figure it out but yeah there's
[51:15] a lot of things to still cover it's
[51:17] almost um it's almost when people
[51:20] discover Bitcoin and I started this
[51:22] podcast actually with uh called the
[51:25] Bitcoin path now like after 20 episode I
[51:27] switched just to my name back because I
[51:29] figured I I don't want to have a Bitcoin
[51:32] branding because I also want to talk
[51:33] about other things and then people get
[51:35] mad if talk one episode about stuff
[51:38] other stuff but in the starting it
[51:41] really was that structure podcast where
[51:43] I asked people about what's your Bitcoin
[51:46] path what's your like how did you get
[51:47] the Bitcoin and stuff like that got
[51:49] pretty boring after after like a while
[51:52] because it it's it's similar um but the
[51:55] one takeaway is some some people really
[51:57] describe finding Bitcoin almost as like
[52:00] a religious experience almost s like
[52:03] only they found God to found something
[52:05] big and there are even like a lot of uh
[52:08] books like thank God for Bitcoin there
[52:10] is uh the uh the pastor coin I don't
[52:14] know what was this book called I forgot
[52:16] but there are a lot of books even around
[52:18] the topic with uh with connecting
[52:20] Christianity or other religions to
[52:23] bitcoin um it's it's almost like there's
[52:25] a religious
[52:27] aspect to bitcoin also with that
[52:29] mystical figure with satosi Nakamoto
[52:31] where yes he created something for Earth
[52:34] but we don't know who s Nakamoto is like
[52:37] it's it's almost like a a mythical
[52:39] figure we which we don't even know who
[52:42] who really is um there's a lot of
[52:44] religious aspects actually do to bitcoin
[52:48] how do you how do you see that I think
[52:49] you also the the private school was a
[52:51] Christian School as you as you said if I
[52:53] remember correctly yeah yeah
[52:57] did did we already talk about this is
[52:59] are you just like like because I don't
[53:01] think we talked about this already but
[53:02] that's to me it's very interesting you
[53:04] bringing that up yeah that's so so I
[53:07] read I read the Bitcoin standard like I
[53:09] said I put the thing down and I went to
[53:12] my friend at my private Christian school
[53:14] and I
[53:15] said I just I just read a book about
[53:18] Bitcoin and this this Bitcoin this whole
[53:23] Bitcoin thing it's it's
[53:27] way more theological than people
[53:29] understand and I feel like I need to
[53:31] write an article and send it off to a
[53:32] Christian magazine or get it get a like
[53:35] it just it just it just struck me to the
[53:37] core in fact you mentioned thank God for
[53:39] Bitcoin this this is actually their
[53:41] little logo because I've been to like
[53:43] three of their little uh conferences and
[53:46] um uh so so so I I I had this idea I was
[53:52] going to I was going to write this
[53:53] article and just help help people
[53:55] understand the theological implications
[53:57] here about Bitcoin uh things like
[54:00] immutability like like that's a
[54:03] theological term God is immutable never
[54:06] changing you don't you don't read
[54:07] immutable and anything else but I'm like
[54:10] what immutability like why am I reading
[54:12] immutability but and then you realize oh
[54:15] because because what a religion is doing
[54:18] is it's it's making a truth
[54:21] claim and you know that truth claim is
[54:24] there to agree or disagree with but it's
[54:26] a truth claim right it's truth it's an
[54:29] absolute
[54:31] versus everything that we're living in
[54:33] these days is is we're living in an era
[54:36] of postmodern relativism where it's like
[54:38] well there's no absolute truth all truth
[54:43] is based on The Interpreter so like and
[54:46] there's no absolute art it's I decide if
[54:48] it's art or not and on and on so I'm
[54:51] just I'm just looking at that going
[54:53] Christian or not at the base level
[54:56] Bitcoin has come along and it's it's
[55:00] it's truth it's absolute and there's no
[55:05] changing it and there's no and so like
[55:08] you know you can get into like nothing
[55:10] nothing you know carries out forever
[55:12] like oh what about that we could change
[55:14] it we get the 50% or but like but by and
[55:16] large the world hasn't seen something
[55:19] that is reliable like a Bedrock or like
[55:23] solid
[55:24] Truth uh
[55:27] you know that this the modern era hasn't
[55:29] seen it right and so I think I think
[55:32] that's that's the primary appeal is is
[55:35] just this wait a
[55:37] second you know I
[55:40] mean you know to I'm not gonna I'm not
[55:43] GNA cuss as a Christian School teacher
[55:45] but like it's like money you can't f
[55:47] with right like it's it's it's
[55:51] like um and so that I think is just
[55:55] there is something AB
[55:57] absolutely beneath the surface religious
[56:00] level there for us so anyway like I I
[56:03] found this book thank God for Bitcoin
[56:05] immediately I like called Jordan and I
[56:07] was like hey I need to talk to you you
[56:09] wrote the book that I would have tried
[56:10] to write and uh so we became buddies um
[56:14] but I don't I don't think you know it's
[56:15] it's you know I'm not I'm not trying to
[56:17] co-op Bitcoin into Christianity I'm just
[56:19] trying I'm just trying to recognize it
[56:21] like hey like as a Christian Christians
[56:24] have some some funny things that are
[56:26] like hurdles for them to like come to
[56:28] bitcoin like you know the Bible talks
[56:30] about a a one world currency in the end
[56:33] days that's that's you know bad and
[56:35] scary and so some
[56:38] Christians they come at it from like oh
[56:40] this is like a bad thing it's like no no
[56:43] no no no no no like we're we're getting
[56:44] back to moral money money that can't be
[56:48] changed you can't you can't mess with it
[56:50] and do you see how that makes the actual
[56:54] money moral right so that's that's the
[56:57] main point of the thank God for Bitcoin
[56:59] book is just we we've got uh theft
[57:03] coming from inflation and now we have
[57:07] somebody who's
[57:08] created the uh antidote to that in in
[57:12] moral money so uh I highly recommend if
[57:16] there's any Christians listening to this
[57:18] to um pursue that book thank God for
[57:21] Bitcoin and those guys those guys have a
[57:23] really good Mission and I would like
[57:26] uh more Christians just to kind of get
[57:29] it but yeah there's there's some but
[57:31] it's it's and it's it's growing slowly
[57:33] but I I don't work for them I don't
[57:35] really actually know how how much
[57:37] traction they're getting but but I think
[57:39] you know I listened to uh other podcasts
[57:42] and and I liked the um God bless Bitcoin
[57:45] video because that came out and that was
[57:48] talking to people of Jewish religions
[57:51] people of Muslim faith and just looking
[57:54] at like yeah actually really
[57:56] all these religions are looking at this
[57:58] going hey this is a a moral step up for
[58:01] us um for for how it would serve us in
[58:04] our religions so I thought that was a
[58:06] nice generous broader approach as
[58:10] well and and and it goes like you shall
[58:14] not steal and then when you look at
[58:16] feared currencies they're stealing uh
[58:20] you're purchasing power so that then
[58:22] it's kind of fair say yeah Bitcoin is
[58:25] moral money um maybe even like God's
[58:29] money but yeah that might go too far uh
[58:32] but Bitcoin is definitely something that
[58:34] doesn't steal from you it actually
[58:36] rewards you uh for for getting more of
[58:38] it so that that's that's that's great
[58:41] that uh that we make that connection I'm
[58:45] myself not super religious uh sometimes
[58:48] um like I I was extremely not religious
[58:51] when I started the podcast and I saw so
[58:53] many podcast guests that are so
[58:55] religious
[58:56] uh then I kind of got more religious
[58:58] over the last year actually um also my
[59:01] girlfriend uh is is more religious than
[59:03] me so like all the forces kind of bring
[59:06] me more to religion uh which is
[59:08] interesting maybe this is completely
[59:09] different in five years and I'm
[59:11] completely religious in in five years
[59:12] when the podcast keeps going let's see
[59:16] uh but it there's definitely some some
[59:18] interesting things there uh the
[59:20] connection between Christianity the
[59:22] connection between Bitcoin and God ER
[59:25] and but I'm just amazed of how many
[59:29] different um explanations we have on
[59:32] bitcoin how many different perspectives
[59:34] and ways to look at that we we we have
[59:37] and I F like I approached a little bit
[59:40] like a business when I started podcast
[59:43] from making it from a passion project to
[59:45] making it like every day and as a
[59:48] business I said like okay what are the
[59:50] risks and one risk that I listed which
[59:52] was completely ridiculous that I even
[59:54] listed it is maybe I get bored with the
[59:59] topics and it's absolutely not the case
[60:02] if I get bored I just like ask questions
[60:03] that interest me more and then the
[60:05] conversation Ste in a different
[60:06] direction so uh it's it's after 320
[60:10] episodes I can say it does not get
[60:12] boring at all it gets actually more
[60:14] interesting uh the more I also know so
[60:17] that that's that's great to see um one
[60:20] thing that I also learned about you you
[60:22] I think you told me that that you're
[60:24] also a licensed fin advisor which
[60:28] is another interesting facet like
[60:30] teacher Bitcoin and and also financial
[60:33] advisor because being a licensed
[60:35] financial advisor and being uh bullish
[60:38] on bitcoin that's a very rare
[60:41] species at least what I found uh how did
[60:44] it come to that that you uh ad acquired
[60:47] that and is it actually for financial
[60:49] advisor hard to um understand Bitcoin to
[60:53] a certain extent I feel like they they
[60:55] they have to unlearn lot of things yeah
[60:57] I mean you teed it up exactly the way it
[60:59] is yeah so so so um like I said my
[61:02] background I grew up poor and so uh you
[61:05] know I um I ended up after my mom had a
[61:10] stroke and I was living in Germany I
[61:12] came home I I changed my major and I
[61:14] ended up teaching in the public school
[61:17] but I just didn't have any money I was
[61:18] like riding my bike to work right
[61:21] and uh and so I just I just decided I
[61:24] was going to learn about money and I was
[61:25] not going to have that same thing happen
[61:27] to me so I got a master's of business
[61:30] and right after that I just immediately
[61:32] started I just had this notion of like I
[61:34] want to help people with their money I
[61:36] could have used some help with money I
[61:38] want to do that for people now now that
[61:39] I've learned about money what I quickly
[61:42] learned is uh it's not easy to help
[61:45] people with their money so to speak uh a
[61:48] lot of times the people that need help
[61:50] the most don't want any help and uh you
[61:54] know I remember like you know my one of
[61:56] my first prospects the guy was like yeah
[61:58] I really could use some help with my
[62:00] money and I've got some money set aside
[62:01] and and then I call him up again he's
[62:04] like a I just I bought a new truck uh
[62:08] use the money on the new truck is that
[62:10] bad appreciating us uh liability like uh
[62:14] maybe you could have put your money into
[62:16] something that was going to go up in
[62:17] value you know just realized like okay
[62:19] like the consumerism and the needing to
[62:22] keep up with the Joneses and and all of
[62:25] these messages that people are fighting
[62:28] with it's it's it's not that easy to
[62:31] help people with their money just like
[62:32] it's it's not that easy to help people
[62:35] who don't want to see Bitcoin to see
[62:37] Bitcoin it's like you I can't I can't
[62:40] force this on you and if you're not open
[62:43] to it and you know ready to so what I
[62:47] quickly Learned was uh I was also going
[62:49] to starve if I was only going to work
[62:52] for people that needed help with their
[62:54] money because they didn't have any money
[62:56] and all of my uh Revenue would be
[62:59] derived from their money the whole the
[63:02] whole model works on you know either
[63:04] assets under management or commission so
[63:07] I quickly realized okay everybody that
[63:09] has money is in the older demographic so
[63:11] I need to start talking to them and
[63:13] helping just helping myself by finding
[63:16] people that were older with money that
[63:18] needed help with their money and and
[63:20] these people ended up being often times
[63:23] widows or people that didn't have a a
[63:26] husband and their life you know it's
[63:27] stereotypical but a lot of times if you
[63:30] look at the the Bitcoin world it's it's
[63:33] m dominated and why is that was like
[63:36] finances has historically been M
[63:39] dominated I'm always telling my my
[63:41] female students hey if you want to have
[63:42] a like really easy like quick path in in
[63:46] a particular industry just just get into
[63:48] finances or or Bitcoin because um all
[63:52] the men will like actually really
[63:54] appreciate you immediately because like
[63:55] oh look a woman actually cares about
[63:57] this too and you know so there's just
[63:59] some sort of historical gender roles
[64:02] that play there but uh you know I I
[64:05] ended up finding my sweet spot just
[64:07] taking care of uh the the finances for
[64:10] for women who had historically had a
[64:13] husband who maybe did that for them and
[64:15] and just couldn't didn't want to learn
[64:16] that and wanted somebody else to do that
[64:18] for them and you know i' had taken care
[64:20] my mom had the stroke so I'd taken care
[64:22] of my mom for many years so uh I just I
[64:25] just think
[64:26] think you know the Lord and life
[64:28] circumstances were just creating in me
[64:31] this person who was going to take care
[64:33] of
[64:33] people and uh and then in uh and then
[64:38] and then I I I left my initial company
[64:40] and I I realized you know I need to have
[64:42] stable income um so I went to work for a
[64:45] high net worth it's called a Trust Bank
[64:48] where they deal with all the estate
[64:49] planning of trusts and money management
[64:51] and that was great but it was definitely
[64:55] uh making very wealthy people that much
[64:58] more wealthy and there was less of a I'm
[65:01] making a difference feeling for me and
[65:04] it didn't take too long before I was I
[65:06] was I was actually really ready to be a
[65:08] little bit more missional and and see if
[65:10] I could um help people I'd actually had
[65:12] a pretty big crisis of Faith right
[65:15] around 40 where I was like ah yeah no
[65:18] God no religion I I'm just G to like
[65:21] ditch it all and then and then really
[65:24] interestingly I won't get into it
[65:26] necessarily unless unless you really
[65:27] want to know but um came back to Faith
[65:32] uh in a significant way and and and then
[65:36] I just I I just wanted to fully be
[65:38] almost like a missionary but I couldn't
[65:39] go anywhere because I was taking care of
[65:41] my mom and so that's one reason another
[65:43] reason why I ended up at this school was
[65:45] because there I felt like I could go I
[65:47] could talk to these students I could
[65:49] share my faith and I could really um
[65:51] make a difference in the world there and
[65:54] then uh two years went by and I and the
[65:56] non-compete ran out so then I was able
[65:58] to just talk to uh some um some people
[66:01] that had known that I was managing money
[66:03] and I got to be very selective with who
[66:05] I was going to work with and none of
[66:07] these people had a lot of money that
[66:10] none of them were hi maybe maybe one of
[66:11] them was a high net worth person but the
[66:13] rest of them were just regular people
[66:15] friends family and just some other
[66:16] people like these widows and these these
[66:18] single women so uh you know fast forward
[66:23] you asked me about how how I integrated
[66:25] Bitcoin I learned about Bitcoin was
[66:27] about
[66:28] $800 uh didn't understand it didn't buy
[66:31] it um time went
[66:34] on uh and it was like after the 2017
[66:38] runup I realized oh there might be
[66:39] something here uh but I I kind of forgot
[66:42] about
[66:43] it um and then uh actually I had a
[66:46] research paper that my I ass signed to
[66:48] my students and one of the students
[66:50] asked me if he could um write about
[66:52] Bitcoin if I knew anything about it and
[66:54] I said sure go ahead and I read his my
[66:57] student I read his research paper and
[66:59] after I read that research paper I raced
[67:02] to my my account to see if I still had
[67:05] an account open with coinbase and I
[67:07] immediately bought as much Bitcoin as I
[67:10] could to this day I'll see this kid's
[67:13] mom you know at social events I'll just
[67:15] say hey remember to let this kid know
[67:17] he's responsible for a good part of my
[67:19] personal net worth you know like I hope
[67:22] you got a good grade because he deserves
[67:25] more than
[67:26] gr but um and then the question was well
[67:29] how do I bring this to my
[67:31] clients and you know what you realize
[67:34] like you're you're you're deriving your
[67:36] fee from assets under management so like
[67:39] you you can only invest in in what's
[67:42] been approved and Bitcoin is just not
[67:44] one of the options uh so the answer was
[67:47] okay well we have to wait for the
[67:50] ETF but you know thankfully for this you
[67:53] know crazy guy named Michael S who's
[67:55] going to like change the world uh I
[67:58] heard him listening to the podcast and
[68:00] they're talking about this exact topic
[68:02] and he said well you don't need an ETF
[68:05] you can just buy micro strategy as a
[68:08] proxy and and you can get exposure for
[68:10] your clients via micro strategy so so
[68:15] that's that's what I've done for my
[68:18] clients and then the ETF got approved
[68:22] and I still didn't I didn't care because
[68:24] uh I just was preferring micro strategy
[68:27] what I what I don't like about the micro
[68:29] strategy approach is uh they're not true
[68:32] bitcoiners they haven't been you know
[68:35] brought into the space of understanding
[68:37] what Bitcoin is freedom money these are
[68:40] people that are older they're not very
[68:42] technical they don't want to sit down
[68:44] with me for a 10hour discourse on this
[68:47] is how we do it and this is why we can
[68:49] do it
[68:51] and uh the Bitcoin custodians that are
[68:54] out there so like the option would be
[68:57] like okay well we're going to take some
[68:58] of your money from this account and then
[68:59] we're going to move it over to you and
[69:01] you'll have it in in true
[69:03] Bitcoin and and then the question is
[69:06] well how do I get my fee right so every
[69:08] financial advisor in the country it has
[69:12] a perverse incentive and they're they're
[69:15] not incentivized
[69:17] to get their clients into actual true
[69:20] Bitcoin unless they do something like
[69:23] what Morgan Rashard does where it's just
[69:25] like
[69:26] flat fee we just charge a fee on all of
[69:29] the assets that we manage and so
[69:31] therefore we can we can put you into a
[69:34] Bitcoin position and you still just pay
[69:36] us on everything that that we um we
[69:39] manage for you but that's not most
[69:43] financial advisors payment structure
[69:46] most financial advisors are just on on
[69:48] the assets under
[69:50] management and for better for worse
[69:53] until until until financial advisor
[69:56] world is able to to take a fee from
[70:00] direct Bitcoin
[70:02] easily uh you know they're just not
[70:04] incentivized to do it and until the
[70:06] until the ETF unless they'd heard of uh
[70:09] mic you'd have to be a pretty hardcore
[70:11] bitcoiner to even understand what micro
[70:14] strategy was doing and and go to that
[70:17] space it's it's not even on like it is
[70:20] now but it wasn't even on the radar of
[70:22] of the entire financial advisor world
[70:25] and and of course you've got you still
[70:27] got brokerages like large brokerages
[70:30] that are advising their clients away
[70:32] from even Bitcoin ETF exposure so truly
[70:37] normally traditional we've made a lot of
[70:40] money doing things our way
[70:42] Hardline Bitcoin you know so that was a
[70:45] longer answer but yeah it's uh it kind
[70:49] of shows how how important that Bitcoin
[70:52] ETF uh was in unlocking a huge amount of
[70:56] capital uh for Bitcoin and I think the
[71:00] more doors we have to bitcoin the better
[71:04] I stay away from micro strategy I stay
[71:06] away from from Bitcoin ETFs I stay away
[71:09] from everything that is not my own self-
[71:12] custody uh private key held uh Bitcoin
[71:16] um but yeah it's it's it's if if you
[71:19] don't have the option to have because
[71:21] there are some pension accounts
[71:23] retirements accounts where you maybe not
[71:24] have option to do it in s cust the
[71:27] Bitcoin uh then that's great you just
[71:31] have a micro strategy play Bitcoin ETF
[71:33] that it's it's a hard question like what
[71:36] do you prefer micro strategy Bitcoin ETF
[71:38] I think I would go with micro strategy
[71:40] but I did not even research that deeply
[71:43] just because uh they have similar risk
[71:45] patterns but Micro strategy is like 5x
[71:49] or 4X
[71:51] leveraged bit Bitcoin went up this year
[71:53] I think two and a half X and
[71:56] uh micro strategy five and a half or
[71:58] Sixx even something along those lines
[72:00] like it it went up quite crazy this year
[72:04] but I I just prefer self casted Bitcoin
[72:06] I I don't like anything else of course
[72:09] yeah of course yeah but you know imagine
[72:11] sitting down with your
[72:13] grandmother right and you want your
[72:15] grandmother to benefit from what's
[72:17] happening with
[72:18] Bitcoin and you say hey Grandma have you
[72:21] ever heard of
[72:22] Bitcoin you're like hey Grandma you're
[72:24] like
[72:26] you you want to self- custody this in
[72:28] this little thing and like you know so
[72:32] so for me it's just a completely
[72:35] different world there and I think
[72:36] there's a lot of Bitcoin like like in in
[72:39] the Bitcoin world I just come across a
[72:41] lot of
[72:42] people that are anti- custodian or anti-
[72:46] sort of the traditional Financial
[72:48] methods and I honestly think they're
[72:50] just being naive to the masses the the
[72:53] masses are so so like so much less
[72:57] sophisticated than the typical bitcoiner
[72:59] is in terms of the ability to understand
[73:02] and use technology and I'm not trying to
[73:04] rip on the masses but like you're just
[73:06] talking about like even in my school
[73:09] very very highly educated people they've
[73:11] all got degrees they're teachers right
[73:13] they're teaching a subject matter and
[73:15] I'm on the on benefits committee for
[73:17] them and you know our job is to make
[73:19] sure the retirement is is uh appropriate
[73:22] and you know there's something called a
[73:24] Target date fund and that Target date
[73:27] fund will adjust based on their age you
[73:29] know it's allocation to stocks and bonds
[73:32] and you 90% of them just go okay Target
[73:35] date fund they they just don't want to
[73:37] think about or contemplate well how
[73:40] could I actually do better they've all
[73:41] sort of just been like you know and
[73:45] so even them you know like I I'll have a
[73:47] conversation with them and I've got no
[73:50] idea what to do how how am I supposed to
[73:51] figure this out you know so it's it's
[73:54] definitely
[73:56] and you know
[73:57] that's kind of going back to that like
[74:00] every time somebody comes to me and they
[74:01] say like you know can I help them the
[74:04] question is always in my in my head like
[74:08] how can I best help this person and for
[74:11] some of these people the best way to
[74:13] help them is to take them full self-
[74:15] custody your route my personal route uh
[74:18] because they're they're capable of it
[74:20] and it's not going to take an arm and a
[74:22] leg out of me for them to get there so
[74:24] I'll start them I've a document I send
[74:26] it to them I said study this read this
[74:28] as soon as you as soon as you digest
[74:30] this we'll be ready to talk so I can't
[74:33] be the one it's it's just not scalable
[74:35] for me to have a one-on-one 10hour
[74:37] conversation with every single person I
[74:39] meet who wants to learn about this right
[74:41] that's just it's just too time intensive
[74:43] so you you start studying if you prove
[74:46] to me that you can do the selfstudy and
[74:47] learn this then we can talk but for
[74:50] other people they're in this range
[74:53] and you you know I think that's that's
[74:56] where a BTF ETF or a micro strategy can
[75:00] help and so like for for my older
[75:02] clients you know I'm not being uh so so
[75:06] how do I how do I go about that you know
[75:09] they'll they trust me implicitly and
[75:11] I'll just say hey guys I have a a a
[75:13] highly volatile Tech stock that is
[75:15] taking advantage of of uh Bitcoin and
[75:19] bitcoin's
[75:20] transformative effect on on the
[75:22] financial ecosystem and um I I just see
[75:26] that right now uh we're in a in a good
[75:29] opportunity to to buy so we're just
[75:31] going to take a position here and
[75:33] depending on their risk profile that's
[75:35] how big of a position will take and I
[75:37] just stay true to the principles and and
[75:39] all of a sudden their portfolio is just
[75:42] you know done what it's done and and
[75:45] they're extremely grateful and they
[75:47] think I've just you know been touched by
[75:50] God with this like magic ability to make
[75:53] their money grow and it's just I to just
[75:55] remind them that we're going to be
[75:56] humble and we're not going to you know
[75:58] we're going to like throw everything in
[76:00] it and we're going to stay calm you know
[76:02] that's great I think it's it really
[76:05] speaks length to to the power of of of
[76:07] Bitcoin also yeah really cool um one
[76:11] question that I asked each and every one
[76:13] of my guests is what can we learn from
[76:16] you besides Bitcoin I mean we talked a
[76:18] lot about other stuff from Bitcoin today
[76:20] but uh is there anything else that uh
[76:22] you can add here that's a great question
[76:25] maybe one little thing I've kind of
[76:27] alluded to it a couple times but you
[76:29] know my mom had a stroke my sister was
[76:31] handicapped she's born with emical cord
[76:33] around her throat so you know my mom had
[76:35] a stroke when I was living in
[76:37] Germany um I wanted to go and have all
[76:40] kinds of Great Adventures but in in my
[76:43] 20s I
[76:44] was bathing my mother dressing my mother
[76:49] I was living at home I was getting
[76:50] nowhere I'd get the alumni report from
[76:53] my college and everything everybody was
[76:55] clerking for this judge and DC or like
[76:59] you know working for a consulting firm
[77:01] and I'm I'm just this loser in my
[77:03] parents' basement taking care of my mom
[77:06] you know riding my bicycle to my job
[77:09] getting nowhere and I did I took care of
[77:11] my mom for 23 years uh and as I was
[77:14] doing that I felt I felt fairly almost
[77:17] cursed like I I just don't have a life
[77:21] I'm not getting anywhere how am I
[77:22] supposed to get anywhere if I have this
[77:24] thing to do
[77:25] and and when I lost my mom uh I realized
[77:28] that that those 23 years were actually a
[77:31] blessing that I didn't
[77:33] understand and and to to to be able to
[77:36] take care of someone I loved day in and
[77:39] day out was
[77:41] actually one of the best things I could
[77:43] have done with my life life's you know
[77:46] if you get a longer life you can look
[77:48] back and understand these things
[77:50] better
[77:53] um and and in fact sometimes the best
[77:57] thing in life is to not get what you
[77:59] want in the moment I think this is a
[78:01] distinctly Bitcoin principle because you
[78:04] know we're talking about time preference
[78:06] and we're talking about putting you know
[78:08] our immediate impulses and needs aside
[78:12] and and you know Finding and and
[78:16] allocating our time and energy to the
[78:18] True
[78:19] Value um and so I guess maybe that would
[78:23] just be like a kind of Way i' End is is
[78:26] if you're in a situation where you're
[78:29] not getting what you want because you
[78:30] have to take care of somebody that you
[78:31] love and it's it's drudgery it's hard it
[78:34] feels just like you're stuck and you're
[78:35] not getting anywhere uh just take hope
[78:38] it'll be over at some point and uh if
[78:43] your experience is like mine you look
[78:44] back on that and and
[78:47] actually you you'll realize that you um
[78:50] you were a hero you're a real life hero
[78:52] in that moment by taking care of that
[78:53] person that you loved and you'll have uh
[78:56] great blessings it won't be easy um
[78:59] you'll be relieved when the burden's
[79:01] lifted but um but you you'll never
[79:05] regret that you did the right thing in
[79:06] that moment and and that'll be part of
[79:08] your story forever and that'll be part
[79:10] of your character forever and keep up
[79:13] the good work that's uh that's beautiful
[79:16] I love that uh really cool we in Austria
[79:22] there is one thing I don't know if you
[79:24] aware of that but we actually have to do
[79:27] after school uh one year volunteer work
[79:30] like we have we're forced to do that by
[79:33] by the by the government we either go to
[79:35] military or we do some uh social thing
[79:39] like taking care of elderly taking care
[79:41] of uh handicapped people taking care of
[79:44] handicapped kids and stuff like
[79:47] that yeah it's it's really really great
[79:50] I did not wanted to contribute to
[79:52] military so I chose
[79:55] the for young men the less attractive
[79:58] option because military is shorter uh
[80:03] and you might do something cool but I I
[80:06] just did not want
[80:07] to yeah exactly yeah so I didn't it
[80:11] didn't felt right for me I just did not
[80:12] want to do that it kind of felt like oh
[80:15] I just like waste half a year there uh
[80:18] in the military and did not want to
[80:19] contribute to there so I actually went
[80:21] the road of helping other people in a
[80:25] social situation where you just like
[80:27] apply and then you get like selected
[80:30] wherever you you get selected and I
[80:32] actually got a really nice spot I got to
[80:34] help handicapp people handicapped kids
[80:36] actually uh and it was great it felt
[80:39] really really cool and I learn a lot in
[80:41] this nine months I in the beginning it
[80:44] it was bad for me because I was forced
[80:45] to do that so the government is kind of
[80:48] forcing you to do that so you don't
[80:50] really have a choice but right now I
[80:53] look back at this time and it it it
[80:54] really teach me a lot it taught me a lot
[80:57] it really is a is a great time of my my
[81:00] life uh but it was just nine months and
[81:03] it was actually really cool uh and it it
[81:05] was not even a thing where I was like oh
[81:08] yeah help Society it's just like
[81:10] something that I actually enjoyed doing
[81:12] while I was doing it I was outside I was
[81:14] in with the kids it was a lot of fun I
[81:17] did par with them I was was in the
[81:19] sports uh thing with him it's even
[81:21] something that I think of
[81:25] maybe at some point I just retire from
[81:27] everything and do like two three days in
[81:30] the in the week uh help like kids or
[81:33] help like elderly people or whatever uh
[81:35] that's that's like a small small small
[81:37] thing uh that I might to but right now
[81:40] just like focus on bitcoin talk with as
[81:43] many people as I can but yeah I just
[81:45] wanted to add this here because it can
[81:47] be it's it's it's not even close to
[81:50] compare comparable to to what you did uh
[81:54] but is is really great to just like help
[81:57] other people and and and do that it's
[81:58] it's something that is fulfilling and
[82:01] enjoyable uh for me at least oh that's
[82:03] great I don't I don't think I knew about
[82:06] that yeah and anything that's compulsory
[82:08] going in the posture is like H but that
[82:12] that uh transition from I I have to do
[82:16] this to I get to do this if you know
[82:18] you're in control of your own emotions
[82:20] and thoughts and and mentality and uh
[82:23] that's one thing I try to always teach
[82:24] my students like you your
[82:27] circumstances you have to learn to not
[82:29] allow your circumstances to dictate your
[82:32] your joy right so absolutely yeah and I
[82:35] enjoyed it a lot even though I still am
[82:38] against the fact that the government is
[82:39] forcing you one year to to work
[82:42] basically for them no matter what you do
[82:44] so I'm still against that
[82:46] system but I actually enjoyed it quite a
[82:49] lot and uh I I might even consider doing
[82:54] that
[82:55] on a voluntary basis now in in hindsight
[82:58] but back then I wouldn't have done it if
[82:59] I wouldn't have been forced to do that
[83:02] so it's it's it's it's funny that
[83:04] something that you disagree with and
[83:05] something that you didn't enjoy in the
[83:07] beginning you actually come do enjoy
[83:09] because it's something great but yeah
[83:12] I'm still not I'm still not in favor of
[83:14] that system I don't think the government
[83:16] should force you into doing anything uh
[83:18] especially not one year long uh that's
[83:21] that's basically slavery for in my eyes
[83:25] yeah yeah more or less but but you can
[83:28] learn something from slavery too I guess
[83:31] um we have an endro in the podcast where
[83:33] the the previous guest is asking a
[83:35] question for the next guest without
[83:37] knowing who the next guest actually is
[83:39] and uh the previous uh and right now we
[83:42] all Focus kind of on the price so it's a
[83:44] kind of price question uh and obviously
[83:47] we we all don't know but it's fun to
[83:49] speculate um and he he asked what will
[83:52] be the highest price uh for Bitcoin in
[83:55] 2025 let's see well we got that sell
[83:57] wall at 100K so uh we'll blow through
[84:01] that if we haven't already this morning
[84:03] I don't know when when uh we we are not
[84:06] I I I see it because uh if if if I
[84:10] actually record while we blow through
[84:12] 100K then I would switch topics yeah
[84:15] yeah yeah okay okay yeah because that
[84:17] would be a topic worthy I know I was
[84:20] like a friend of mine was wanting to get
[84:22] together and talk about Bitcoin I was
[84:23] like he's like you know should we should
[84:26] we do it at a coffee shop it's like well
[84:29] maybe we should do it at a steak dinner
[84:30] you know like wait until we get the time
[84:32] to celebrate but I Yeah by end of
[84:37] 2025 um I'll go with uh go with
[84:43] 320 a it's a good it's a good one I
[84:46] think it's really hard because like
[84:48] everything can can basically happen next
[84:50] year we can have like a kind of super
[84:54] start and we completely boost off or
[84:56] it's kind of normal cycle where we end
[84:58] up like with I don't know 200,000
[85:00] 250,000 or something like that so
[85:02] everything can happen but yeah I guess I
[85:05] just generally think about like well why
[85:06] why did the last crash happen right and
[85:10] I just think you've you've gotten rid of
[85:12] the the
[85:15] FTX it's it's not likely the fed's gonna
[85:18] raise rates again at the rate they just
[85:20] raised them there's a lot of regularity
[85:23] clarity
[85:25] and truly if if all these guys start
[85:29] taking you know significant positions in
[85:32] in their institutional level you know
[85:36] like uh insurance companies all these
[85:38] guys with like deeper money like none of
[85:41] this bigger money has come into Bitcoin
[85:42] at all yet you know so it's starting to
[85:45] now and if it's just like even just a
[85:48] did a little bit I think people would
[85:49] just be shocked we just you know like
[85:52] yeah we didn't really talk about it but
[85:54] whenever I talk about this with my
[85:55] students I'm I was like you guys just I
[85:57] just can't even explain to you what it's
[85:59] like to have looking at an investment
[86:02] and seeing that the supply is fixed like
[86:06] in this equation supply and demand and
[86:08] one is fixed that's just so unheard of
[86:12] it's for me like second I came to
[86:14] bitcoin I was just like wait the suppli
[86:16] is fixed this is the biggest no-brainer
[86:18] because I've never come across anything
[86:20] where the supply is fixed if the supply
[86:22] is fixed then I can know some much more
[86:24] about this than I I could ever anything
[86:27] else because everything else if the
[86:28] supply is not fixed then it's anybody's
[86:31] guess you know so
[86:33] yeah yeah I think we it's kind
[86:38] of unch atory like it's something that
[86:41] we we never experienced before where we
[86:45] have digital
[86:46] available asset money that is completely
[86:50] fixed in Supply and everyone would
[86:53] benefit from adopting it like no matter
[86:55] if you are uh a single mom working a
[86:59] full-time job trying to keep up with
[87:01] with everything or you are like the
[87:03] hedphone manager with like hundreds of
[87:05] millions of wealth like everyone on that
[87:07] Spectrum benefits from adopting Bitcoin
[87:10] uh and then the supply is fixed it's
[87:13] everywhere available you just need like
[87:14] a phone and internet connection um that
[87:18] is that that has some
[87:21] dangerously uh in a positive sense
[87:24] a mixture of can go really really high
[87:29] if something happens uh but it's also
[87:31] really volatile so there we just don't
[87:35] know what happens uh in the short term
[87:38] there's are so many crazy theories out
[87:40] there and that's exactly the reason why
[87:43] the the meme of like stay humble stay
[87:46] exess just like keep focus on like was
[87:48] actually um um necessary that that's I
[87:52] think the the biggest message there
[87:55] yeah my first my first Bitcoin
[87:57] conference was Pacific Bitcoin that Swan
[87:59] put on a couple years back when when the
[88:02] price was you know just plummeting and
[88:04] it got down to like
[88:06] 15K remember just I was there with a guy
[88:08] that had bought at the top
[88:11] and you know he was just he was just
[88:14] trying to like make sense of it all and
[88:17] it was just very we just we just came
[88:19] out of there just vowing to each other
[88:20] like we just got to do that that's a
[88:22] really good good MCH Mantra uh I know
[88:25] it's you know been repeated many times
[88:27] but stay humble stack SATs this is
[88:31] generational every every piece of
[88:33] Bitcoin I get I think I think one of my
[88:36] earliest thoughts was like 21 million
[88:38] total it'd be really cool to have one
[88:41] one millionth of that you know it's like
[88:44] a stacking goal you know that was like
[88:47] possible back when it was like 5K or
[88:49] whatever you know like at at 90 you know
[88:53] 98 99 100K it's you know you got to have
[88:55] a little deeper Pockets but I think it's
[88:58] a pretty good idea just to sort of give
[89:00] yourself a hey for for future
[89:03] Generations I'm going to have a certain
[89:05] piece of this pie that no one's going to
[89:07] be able to pull away from me
[89:09] so kind of fun absolutely 100% agreed

[90:59] next year next year if I if I'm still
[91:01] teaching next year I think I will be but
[91:03] next year I'm going to convert my entire
[91:04] class grading
[91:06] system uh to be based on bitcoin Satoshi
[91:10] so so literally I'm just GNA like commit
[91:12] a certain amount of Satoshi to each
[91:14] class and all semester long they're
[91:17] going to earn Satoshi for their grades
[91:19] instead of actual grades and then uh
[91:22] we'll convert those back to letter
[91:24] grades at the end but I'm just going to
[91:26] fully immerse them in that Noster
[91:29] Satoshi uh zapping World for for their
[91:34] for their class so that should be fun
