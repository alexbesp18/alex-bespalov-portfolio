[00:00] I don't care whether you buy Bitcoin
[00:02] doesn't make sense to mine with energy
[00:04] coming from an an energy Outlet in a
[00:07] German household you need to look for
[00:09] renewable energy and by Design somehow
[00:11] with the Haring happening now in April
[00:14] the block rewards for the miners will
[00:16] half from 6.25 to 3.125 so that means
[00:20] that the energy used by the miners has
[00:22] to be cheaper and even more renewable so
[00:25] it forces the miners and the network to
[00:27] be more green I earned it as bandage
[00:30] every every month my bank account was
[00:32] empty since I'm in Bitcoin I'm
[00:34] saving I always wonder how should I
[00:37] start my podcast and there are so many
[00:39] different topics I want to go into there
[00:41] but I saw one tweet of yours uh where
[00:43] you said about the Haring so and I think
[00:46] this episode will Air in like two three
[00:49] weeks so it will be right around before
[00:53] we get into the Haring so my question is
[00:55] for you like what do you expect before
[00:58] the Haring uh after the having in the
[01:00] next coming years uh the having having
[01:03] an impact on bitcoin or does it even
[01:05] have an
[01:06] impact yeah they would have to separate
[01:09] in two things uh um impact in Bitcoin in
[01:12] terms of value in Fiat or impact in
[01:16] Bitcoin in what happens with the Bitcoin
[01:18] uh through the Haring event so uh har
[01:22] Haring the the output the supply of of
[01:25] of Bitcoin this is the one hand but I
[01:27] think your question goes more in the
[01:29] direction of of value of Bitcoin in
[01:31] field um so how would the development be
[01:34] in this direction yeah I think what I
[01:38] see so I'm I'm I'm in Bitcoin more or
[01:41] less since 2014 and since maybe 2018 I
[01:46] would say 19 I spent several hours per
[01:49] day in the Bitcoin revitol and I really
[01:52] try to understand the the Haring Cycles
[01:55] in the past and you and now you see the
[01:57] Bitcoin curve and you put in some some
[02:00] rings there typical development and
[02:02] usually a little bit before the Haring
[02:05] um the value increases and afterwards
[02:08] there is the bull run and I'm not sure
[02:12] for for this Haring cycle in April um
[02:16] whether the effect of the Haring the
[02:18] impact on on bitcoin will be the same as
[02:20] in the past I expected it would would be
[02:23] more flat as it's just going from 6.25
[02:27] to
[02:28] 3.125 Bitcoin uh with every new block
[02:33] but with all the um let's say events in
[02:38] the in the environment of Bitcoin like
[02:40] the ETFs I'm not sure so um so the
[02:44] demand is is U enormous and I see this
[02:49] um limited Supply through the Haring
[02:51] will probably lead to really Bull Run um
[02:56] I would say maybe from from middle of
[02:57] April on and speaking in terms of future
[03:00] my future expectations so many people
[03:02] I'm in contact with many people talking
[03:04] about Bitcoin you know I try to always
[03:06] tease and not push people to bitcoin but
[03:09] give them the opportunity to say hey you
[03:11] I see you have something to do with
[03:13] Bitcoin uh what do you think about this
[03:15] and that and and then people many people
[03:18] ask me what what would you expect Larry
[03:21] uh how would the development be in terms
[03:23] of pricing for the next time and then I
[03:26] would say my estimate is something like
[03:28] until q1 Q to so first half of
[03:33] 2025 uh we will see a a really heavy
[03:36] Bull Run I would expect something like
[03:39] uh I I'm very sure there there will not
[03:41] be uh a push back until spring next year
[03:45] I would say so I expect some some minor
[03:48] dips but in general it will be really a
[03:51] bull market now we already bull market
[03:54] so it's more the Bull Run what I expect
[03:56] now and we like I see it every cycle
[03:59] that always this talks of a super cycle
[04:03] yeah and I I feel like it always comes
[04:06] up before the Haring H but I think it
[04:10] might actually happen this time we never
[04:11] had an alltime high before the Haring we
[04:14] have the Bitcoin ETF like we have the
[04:16] strongest demand ever but you could see
[04:19] this before every having do you see
[04:21] something ever happening with the super
[04:23] cycle especially when the Haring has a
[04:25] lower and lower impact over time is the
[04:28] one point where this crazy crash and
[04:30] this foure Cycles this really
[04:32] predictable cycle of Bitcoin just don't
[04:35] continue at all in the
[04:38] future no I don't I don't think it will
[04:41] be more or less flat again at any time I
[04:44] see an increase through things coming in
[04:46] the market so we had the ETFs being
[04:49] approved in January 11 so we see that
[04:52] there is a huge inflow into Bitcoin and
[04:54] of course we have some outflows you know
[04:56] gray scale the miners are selling
[04:59] Bitcoin to be prepared for the harving
[05:01] and uh to be able to
[05:04] invest but I think hearing what Black
[05:06] Rock and Fidelity and all the ETF uh
[05:09] providers tell about their expectations
[05:12] in Market uh they they are talking about
[05:15] a three-digit number of millions dollars
[05:18] to be um invested in Bitcoin until the
[05:22] next something like 3 years so I believe
[05:26] that this will be a very longterm bull
[05:29] market and we have several other things
[05:31] in front of us like the fasb which is
[05:34] the um the new um accounting rule for
[05:38] companies in us uh which will be enabled
[05:41] end of the year so that will help
[05:44] companies to invest in Bitcoin better as
[05:47] they can show it more in their um in in
[05:50] their um um balance sheet yeah balance
[05:55] sheet thank you that was what I was
[05:57] looking for the balance sheet so with
[05:59] the real word and real value and not
[06:01] with something like the deepest value
[06:03] over the last time they owned it that
[06:06] will be an advantage and we have there's
[06:08] just some um advisers now selling
[06:12] Bitcoin really so the the smaller ones
[06:14] will start in April May time frame and
[06:17] there is a huge Market that will be
[06:18] addressed over the next weeks and I
[06:21] don't see why that should stop of course
[06:23] there will be people selling Bitcoin in
[06:24] the ETFs again but um others will will
[06:27] buy so I don't think it will go flat at
[06:31] any time anymore so I I see for the next
[06:34] three four five years and then it's
[06:36] infinite more or less as then one day we
[06:39] have something like a hyper poniz what I
[06:42] I don't think I don't mean really so it
[06:44] it it would be the perfect world we use
[06:46] Bitcoin for payments uh but I I see it
[06:50] as an asset and many people will invest
[06:52] in this asset in this a unique asset uh
[06:55] over the next decade and and and
[06:58] infinite yeah and uh what what people
[07:01] might not don't know about you uh you
[07:03] are one of the the the best orange
[07:06] pillars I think uh and it's like because
[07:09] like usually when people get a lot of
[07:11] other people to invest in Bitcoin or
[07:13] orange bill and educate people on
[07:15] bitcoin like really big numbers they
[07:17] like influencers they have a huge
[07:19] following they have like 100,000
[07:20] followers of course they have a lot of
[07:22] people coming into Bitcoin because they
[07:24] have content and they can uh like
[07:26] automate the process but I think you're
[07:28] doing a really good job in educating
[07:30] people around you and then you talk with
[07:32] some numbers like oh you have so many
[07:34] people already Orange Building along the
[07:36] way which is amazing for me I I don't
[07:38] get to those numbers I
[07:41] think maybe indirectly but not directly
[07:44] H what did you learn with with educating
[07:46] people what did you learn when how can
[07:48] we as bitcoiners get better in uh
[07:51] educating people about
[07:54] Bitcoin yeah what I learned of course
[07:58] maybe you know you know it is well as
[08:00] once you're on the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole
[08:01] you want to convince everyone and but
[08:05] I'm more careful I'm not too pushy in
[08:07] terms of uh talking to people so I wear
[08:10] some uh orange Bitcoin shoes with a
[08:12] Bitcoin logo I have some shirts where I
[08:15] show something and uh I have stickers on
[08:17] my laptop from the company and to to
[08:20] give the people a chance to ask me so
[08:23] not hey hey everyone here's Larry let's
[08:25] talk about Bitcoin and then they oh no
[08:27] I'm afraid and I don't want to do this
[08:30] and I learned
[08:31] that um it's better to do it not too
[08:34] aggressively really let give people the
[08:37] opportunity to open the door say hey I
[08:39] heard this about Bitcoin and and uh I
[08:42] heard that and can you help me
[08:44] understanding things better and this is
[08:45] a door open and yeah orange pills many
[08:49] many people so far and and what means
[08:51] orange pilling so as I mentioned is I
[08:54] see three scenarios so the people who
[08:57] understand Bitcoin and as a tool for
[08:59] freedom for hope so the more the thing
[09:03] like fix the money fix the word really
[09:05] it's a tool for Freedom this is the most
[09:07] important aspect for me then there are
[09:09] people who say yeah I understand Bitcoin
[09:12] and I try to buy some a small amount
[09:15] maybe some DCA and investing I don't
[09:18] know 50 euro per month or something like
[09:20] that and then there are people who
[09:22] invest heavily so I convinced uh several
[09:24] people even people who were really
[09:27] negative about Bitcoin uh will be
[09:29] forbidden and they will put a lot of tax
[09:31] on it and it has no chance and the
[09:33] network will be hacked it's not secure
[09:35] it's not decentralized whatever and most
[09:38] of them really are owning more than 10
[09:41] Bitcoin today so and so my strategy is
[09:44] being careful and people in my private
[09:48] Network know me also in the company I
[09:50] have a huge Network I work in iot in Ai
[09:54] and uh you need a lot of Partners and
[09:56] people to work with in in this um
[09:58] professional environment
[10:00] and also people use the opportunity to
[10:02] talk to me there and uh one of the board
[10:04] of directors in our company uh asked me
[10:08] to to hold a speech in front of the
[10:11] whole
[10:11] company about Bitcoin so as there are
[10:14] many people interested so they they see
[10:16] me in on the floor and say hey Larry
[10:18] yeah I see your Bitcoin logo and your
[10:19] shirt and I wanted to ask something and
[10:22] and it it really it comes together
[10:24] somehow and people ask me hey I was
[10:26] talking to some friends and we would
[10:28] like to invite you Larry to hold a
[10:30] speech uh some evening and I can invite
[10:34] 20 30 people and then I talk to 20 30
[10:38] people in the meantime I have a
[10:39] presentation with some videos so that
[10:41] they better understand and I plan
[10:43] something like at least two hours so
[10:45] it's 90 minutes presentation but it's
[10:47] more the dialogue which is very
[10:48] important let people ask questions to
[10:50] better understand and after doing a
[10:52] speech in front of 20 30 people or
[10:56] independent also from the number I would
[10:57] say something like um 10 20% of the
[11:00] people uh discussing with me they come
[11:03] back later something like a week or 3
[11:06] months later and ask hey Larry that was
[11:09] really interesting I learned a lot I
[11:10] have some additional questions can we
[11:12] discuss or and can you help me uh
[11:15] setting up a wallet how can I invest how
[11:17] can I get some Bitcoins how can I own
[11:19] board to the system and then I talk
[11:21] about really what kind of software
[11:23] wallet how to easily buy Bitcoin how to
[11:25] store in in a hardware wallet the safest
[11:28] way so that they really have to uh to
[11:30] learn about how to handle their seeds
[11:32] and all this
[11:34] stuff amazing and uh what do you see is
[11:37] like people having hurdles like when you
[11:40] see so many people and they ask you
[11:42] question and so di like first of all I
[11:44] would love to see all those videos like
[11:46] I would love for you to to actually
[11:48] record those sessions uh what you what
[11:51] you talk and the session um with with
[11:55] the the company it would be really
[11:56] really cool I think if you provide those
[11:58] videos online I think people would love
[12:00] it um IDE but what what do you see as
[12:04] like common hurdles that people have to
[12:06] come over like uh I I and this is
[12:08] something I do a lot on the podcast
[12:10] because I have people from India on I
[12:12] have people from Germany on I have
[12:13] people from Africa on and from Salvador
[12:16] I have a lot of people on and people
[12:20] have different hurdles in different
[12:22] countries that they have to overcome
[12:24] like in in El Salvador they now think
[12:28] that Bitcoin is from the government
[12:30] because na pushes Bitcoin down so so
[12:35] there is different hurdles people have
[12:37] to overcome uh in order to understand
[12:40] Bitcoin what what are the most common
[12:41] questions or hurdles you see yeah it's
[12:44] it's really a very uh broad variety of
[12:49] hurdles and questions as you say I have
[12:52] many people so it's more my age or older
[12:56] they don't trust the um econom and the
[13:00] Fiat system or even other asset classes
[13:03] anymore so they are really hesitative
[13:06] what to do with their money and some of
[13:07] them have a lot of money or they just
[13:09] selling some real estate and say what to
[13:12] do with the money really I don't trust
[13:14] uh saving it in Fiat money and let it
[13:16] grab by inflation and or I don't trust
[13:20] in real estate anymore and I I'm not
[13:22] sure about stock markets and and the
[13:24] economy in uh in in total uh what can I
[13:28] do so this is the one aspect what to do
[13:30] with my money in a safe way and then
[13:33] these every people not only these people
[13:36] everyone has to understand about how
[13:38] secure is Bitcoin not talking about the
[13:41] value development it's it's more about
[13:43] is it really secure can it be
[13:45] confiscated is is it somehow uh
[13:48] manipulate
[13:50] manipulative um are there chances for
[13:54] someone in the world to grab their money
[13:56] and I think this is a topic for all the
[13:57] people in the world and Bitcoin is a
[13:59] very open system every every everyone
[14:02] can jump in and just use Bitcoin without
[14:04] asking anyone without having a third
[14:06] party uh included in between and this is
[14:09] one aspect the question so they really
[14:12] have to understand that's secure and I
[14:15] tell them that it's as long it's secure
[14:18] as long as you are careful with your
[14:20] seed and you understand Bitcoin this is
[14:23] why I hold these speeches and I talk to
[14:25] them and really my intention is to make
[14:27] them understand what is Bitcoin with not
[14:30] all the aspects but many aspects you
[14:32] know there are so many aspects around
[14:34] Bitcoin you can learn about ethics and
[14:36] uh cryptography and physics and whatever
[14:40] and and uh but so that they
[14:44] have uh an understanding about Bitcoin
[14:48] so that they feel secure that this is a
[14:51] good asset to store their value whatever
[14:54] this is into Bitcoin and how to handle
[14:56] it so this is the one uh I I had a
[14:59] discussion with one of our board members
[15:01] in the company yesterday and he said
[15:03] yeah yeah I I'm following Bitcoin now
[15:06] and and tracking the value and it
[15:07] doubled within the the last something
[15:09] week some weeks and I said yes but it's
[15:13] used by so many criminals I said yeah
[15:16] this is what people hear and what people
[15:18] should hear if if you're uh if you hear
[15:21] our government and uh ECB and uh
[15:26] politicians and Banks they are not a
[15:29] friend of Bitcoin of course that's
[15:30] competition somehow and they talk about
[15:33] it's used by criminals it it consumes a
[15:35] lot of energy but back to this criminals
[15:37] aspect I told them I there we have
[15:39] companies tracking really the use and of
[15:41] course they have to work with some
[15:43] assumptions but uh the criminal use of
[15:45] Bitcoin is uh the last um period was
[15:48] something like
[15:50] 0.34% so it's much more criminal
[15:53] activities done with the dollar and the
[15:55] Euro or other cryptocurrencies and I
[15:57] told him by the way not a good idea to
[16:00] do some some money laundry or criminal
[16:03] activities with Bitcoin as it's not
[16:06] Anonymous so you can track all the
[16:09] activities in the blockchain since 15
[16:11] years by the way and if there is one
[16:14] point where it's connected with your
[16:16] identity then uh they have you so yeah
[16:19] this is also the reason why some
[16:21] criminals T working with Bitcoin doing
[16:22] bad business but uh they also get away
[16:25] from it as they understand oops that's
[16:27] not really Anonymous and they will get
[16:29] us in the end so that's another aspect
[16:32] uh criminal use the the the other one is
[16:35] consumption of energy so it uses energy
[16:38] like Austria like Netherlands like I
[16:42] Italy something like whole countries or
[16:44] uh pools of of water for every
[16:48] Transaction what we do he um but this is
[16:52] also something where I say yes that's
[16:54] true of course Bitcoin uses energy all
[16:56] the other currencies by the way also use
[16:58] energy
[16:59] but the energy is what makes Bitcoin
[17:01] secure so Bitcoin is the only system
[17:04] where we have a closed system a really
[17:07] centralized system with without any
[17:09] engagement from third party or from
[17:11] outside even the new Bitcoins are
[17:13] generated inside the system with finding
[17:16] a block there is a new supply of of some
[17:18] um some Bitcoins for the miners getting
[17:21] into the market but it we we know the
[17:24] path for the new supply for the next 120
[17:26] years until the last Bitcoin will be
[17:28] mined so this is crystal clear and we
[17:31] have the proof of work which which is
[17:33] the differentiator for Bitcoin against
[17:35] every other
[17:36] cryptocurrency as this is what needs the
[17:39] energy so the miners of course they need
[17:41] the energy but in the end uh you cannot
[17:43] just change the blockchain so you canot
[17:45] say hey my blockchain is the longer one
[17:48] it's valid now and this is not working
[17:50] with Bitcoin so the proof of work is
[17:52] what secures the Bitcoin what makes it
[17:54] unique and uh also something what what
[17:58] people are interested when I tell the
[18:00] story about Satoshi Nakamoto doing um
[18:04] publishing the white paper in end of
[18:07] 2008 and I'm not sure to be honest
[18:11] personally whether he already thought
[18:13] about this aspect or it happen happens
[18:16] now by accident so if you want to be a
[18:19] minor um it's
[18:21] not it's not worth mining uh if you have
[18:25] an an energy price above 7 8 9 Cent per
[18:29] kilowatt so it doesn't make sense to
[18:32] mine with energy coming from an an
[18:35] energy Outlet in a German household
[18:38] that's just stupid and so you need to
[18:42] look for renewable energy or even over
[18:45] energy so you have some unused energy
[18:48] you can use so and by Design somehow by
[18:51] accident or by plan I don't know this is
[18:54] the aspect I'm not sure and uh with the
[18:58] Haring happening now in April uh 19th or
[19:01] 20th of April as it looks today uh the
[19:04] the block rewards for the miners will
[19:07] half from 6 uh 25 to 3.125 so that means
[19:12] that the energy used by the miners has
[19:14] to be even cheaper and even more
[19:16] renewable so it forces the miners and
[19:19] the network to be more green and it's
[19:21] one of the greenest networks anyway
[19:23] already today in the market if you see
[19:26] um energy consumption and including all
[19:28] the Network for B for battery electric
[19:30] vehicle I'm a Tesla driver I'm a fan and
[19:32] I know they uh they are very efficient
[19:35] as a car but if you also see the aspect
[19:38] of the production and of the energy then
[19:41] it's probably not that green anymore in
[19:42] some cases um and Bitcoin is forced to
[19:46] be green and it's already very green so
[19:49] this is another aspect I would say
[19:51] that's the the the three most important
[19:54] security can I securely invest in
[19:56] Bitcoin uh crial use and energy
[20:00] consumption this is the main um
[20:03] objectives yeah and I think it's natural
[20:05] for uh such a disruptive innovation as
[20:09] Bitcoin to bring some hurdle some fud uh
[20:12] along the line we we see this old Comics
[20:15] around the internet is being just a f
[20:18] and Fade Away we seeing even from older
[20:21] where there was Comics against
[20:25] electricity so uh there always when
[20:27] there's something completely changing a
[20:30] system there will
[20:31] be most people really skeptical this is
[20:35] also like I think not bad as human
[20:38] beings which is also like we we try to
[20:40] stay stable we're not trying to change
[20:42] too much uh but then it's the the the
[20:46] the thing that we have to change uh in
[20:49] increments and I think Bitcoin is the
[20:51] next increment we need to have as a base
[20:53] layer but it's completely normal and in
[20:56] the beginning I was always frustrated
[20:57] with orange peing people I was like why
[20:59] do you don't get it like what's wrong
[21:01] with what's wrong with you but in the
[21:05] the more time I spent Orange Building
[21:07] people the more time I um spend time
[21:10] also with bitcoiners and exchanging with
[21:12] their Orange Building stories I learned
[21:15] that you have to give them time it's not
[21:17] something uh it uh like it accumulates
[21:20] over time I always I'm always like on
[21:23] every social media platform I'm with my
[21:25] clear name there and it's really clear
[21:27] that I'm a Bitcoin it's like there's no
[21:29] confusion with that and people also in
[21:32] my personal life know about that so I
[21:36] switch completely off my orange pilling
[21:39] uh offensive I'm only waiting for people
[21:42] to ask me stuff and I sometimes could be
[21:45] even more a little bit more offensive I
[21:47] could be like even more a little bit
[21:49] more um provoking and
[21:53] conversation I'm I'm intentionally not
[21:56] doing that because I'm all I'm letting
[21:59] my Bitcoin energy out on the internet
[22:01] and hoping people come in real life and
[22:03] it it works fine because in the bare
[22:05] Market a few people come uh and the bull
[22:08] market more people come obviously the
[22:11] the topic is more there because with n
[22:13] technology the best marketing tool of
[22:15] Bitcoin still uh people come in uh and
[22:18] it's it's it's good to just wait and see
[22:21] uh who's coming uh and but still make it
[22:26] clear you can come to me because I'm a
[22:28] Bitcoin and then Bitcoin comes up in a
[22:30] conversation and there's some f Around
[22:32] The Family Table then you can say but
[22:35] it's like that like and it's also when I
[22:38] see the family tables over the years
[22:40] it's like oh there are two more
[22:43] bitcoiners in this 30 people around oh
[22:46] there's now two more like like four four
[22:48] years ago it was just me I'm the crazy
[22:51] one now we are three people now we five
[22:54] soon there will be two people that don't
[22:56] have Bitcoin and they will be The Crazy
[22:57] Ones yeah yeah same here I've tried to
[23:01] be passive as I mentioned just wearing
[23:03] some logos and a sticker on my Tesla at
[23:06] the back there's a a sticker which is
[23:09] Bitcoin accepted here many people
[23:11] watching hey great and or I wear
[23:14] sweatshirts and if I enter a restaurant
[23:15] I had a day maybe three month ago I was
[23:19] in two restaurants for lunch and the the
[23:22] waiter said hey do you do you know a
[23:24] little bit more about Bitcoin and say
[23:25] yes you want to talk yes yeah we want to
[23:28] use Bitcoin in our restaurant and uh in
[23:31] the evening I was out for dinner same
[23:33] story the waiter and even the boss of
[23:34] the restaurant came and say hey can you
[23:36] help us understand how we as a
[23:38] restaurant can use Bitcoin or in in in
[23:41] my environment here my my friends
[23:43] colleagues people know and they are
[23:45] talking hey I did you hear that Larry
[23:47] knows something about Bitcoin and he's
[23:49] doing speeches and as you mentioned also
[23:52] yeah I'm careful and I know I had people
[23:55] sitting in my speeches for two hours
[23:57] plus three times they went off the first
[24:00] day and said yeah was was great then
[24:03] they they even wrote me a message or
[24:04] called me said hey I I didn't understand
[24:06] really this and I have an additional
[24:08] question can I ask yes of course I'm
[24:10] always there to orange pill and help and
[24:12] uh then they came to the second uh
[24:14] Speech and then they are on the third
[24:16] one and then three months later they say
[24:18] hey Larry I think now I got it and can
[24:20] you help me uh being on board it and how
[24:23] how I can buy Bitcoins and then I go to
[24:25] the people and and if it's not too far
[24:27] away uh otherwise I send them them some
[24:30] kind of instructions on a messenger or
[24:32] something like that and but usually I
[24:34] really go to their apartment visit them
[24:37] and say hey let's do it together so and
[24:39] I show you some things and I show it on
[24:41] my mobile phone and bring my bit box as
[24:44] a hardare wallet to really make them
[24:46] understand how it's um best way handled
[24:50] in in a practical way also really being
[24:53] The Trusted adviser not just doing a
[24:55] speech and I also tell them I don't care
[24:57] whether you buy Bitcoin I'm happy if you
[25:00] understand a little bit of Bitcoin and I
[25:02] am in Bitcoin now for years really
[25:03] spending thousands of hours and I also
[25:05] feel like being a beginner anymore I
[25:08] even did my uh certified Bitcoin
[25:10] professional uh certification in in
[25:12] October time frame which was really a
[25:15] lot of huge learning also as well but I
[25:18] still feel I'm a beginner every day I
[25:20] learn a lot more yeah it's uh the same
[25:24] feeling I had when I started the podcast
[25:25] when people are coming on to my podcast
[25:27] and they have like a really specific
[25:28] knowledge about a really deep Rabbit
[25:30] Hole in Bitcoin and I'm sitting there
[25:31] I'm like I don't understand anything
[25:33] here and I'm learning Bitcoin for so
[25:35] long and it humbles you every time you
[25:38] speak with other bitcoiners when you
[25:39] learn about new stuff and it's it's it's
[25:41] fascinating for me yeah one question for
[25:45] for the last question to the orange
[25:46] pillings uh do you think self- custody
[25:49] will be mainstream do you think we have
[25:52] uh mainstream adoption of self custody
[25:54] or will the most people use some app
[25:56] some layer on top of the some Bitcoin F
[25:59] uh and people don't
[26:01] use I hope and I fight for self custody
[26:05] of course as Bitcoin as we we do and we
[26:07] push for self
[26:09] custody and I see a huge increase in
[26:12] this area but on the other hand I see
[26:14] with these ETFs etps etns all the
[26:17] possibilities for investing in Bitcoin
[26:20] or handling Bitcoin on
[26:22] exchanges I also see this area growing
[26:26] very fast so I'm not sure so the self
[26:29] custody will be heavily increasing but I
[26:33] also see the other way growing and also
[26:36] I had a discussion yesterday with a with
[26:37] a person I know quite well and he he
[26:40] asked I watched this Bitcoin now for
[26:42] some month and I see it doubled in value
[26:45] in in compared to F money as we always
[26:48] say one Bitcoin is one Bitcoin we don't
[26:50] care but you watch the the value
[26:52] increase in in euros and dollars and he
[26:54] was interested in quickly jump in and he
[26:57] said how can I
[26:58] rapidly go and get into Bitcoin and his
[27:02] first question was what do you think are
[27:04] we at the end now so it doubled now and
[27:07] it has to be the end in terms of
[27:09] increasing value for for Bitcoin is a no
[27:12] I believe that we probably will triple
[27:15] quadruple by early next year very my
[27:19] very as a I I don't be an adviser for
[27:22] financial things I always tell them but
[27:24] a very conservative personal view is
[27:26] that we will at least triple until early
[27:28] next year in terms of uh dollars and
[27:33] then I also said hey maybe if you really
[27:35] want to get in quickly do you have
[27:37] something like a binance trade Republic
[27:39] eoro is not allowed to handle Bitcoin
[27:41] anymore since early this year but if you
[27:43] have something like that just buy
[27:45] Bitcoin and then you can transfer it to
[27:46] your wallet you should transfer and
[27:48] always I tell all people if you buy it
[27:50] on an exchange you're not the owner not
[27:52] your keys not your coins as we say as
[27:55] bitcoiners and I always push them you
[27:58] can buy it there but please quickly put
[28:00] it on your wallet and keep your 12 24
[28:04] seed worth and have it on your own and
[28:06] in self- custody yeah I see both markets
[28:09] growing heavily really and with the ETFs
[28:11] the the institutional investors the
[28:14] Pension funds will come that's such an a
[28:17] huge volume so this will also for sure
[28:20] increase yeah and um you always have to
[28:24] uh like for uh how do I say that
[28:30] um I you said before that you are a big
[28:33] fan also of electric car and I see a lot
[28:35] of uh different bitcoiners having on on
[28:39] bitcoin so many different STS like I see
[28:42] uh for example bitcoiners being
[28:44] completely Carnival only eating meats
[28:47] and then there's bitcoiners that are
[28:48] completely vegan uh so but they are
[28:51] sitting together on one table and they
[28:53] have one few uh of the world with
[28:55] Bitcoin but they have on another topic
[28:57] completely different confus then there's
[28:59] also electric cars where you said you're
[29:01] a big fan of it but then there's I think
[29:04] who said it cerine I think is
[29:06] a not a big fan of electric car Mark is
[29:11] not a fan Mark fried yes Mark FR also um
[29:16] how do you see the those different like
[29:18] first of all I think Bitcoin in general
[29:20] is such a broad topic and such fun
[29:22] fundamental to us to our lives that of
[29:25] course there will be people that don't
[29:26] think the same like this will completely
[29:29] be natural because there are people that
[29:32] uh have different views of the world
[29:34] because it's such a big thing how do you
[29:36] see this um electric cars are electric
[29:39] cars uh feat or
[29:41] Bitcoin how do you see a few uh those
[29:44] kind of topics also with with food um
[29:48] going into like yeah is it can there be
[29:51] something more feat or Bitcoin in in
[29:54] terms of electric cars or in in terms of
[29:56] vegan food or Carnival Food
[29:59] yes I'm a huge fan of electric cars in
[30:01] driving Tesla I have my third Tesla now
[30:04] driving Tesla for five years and over
[30:06] 400,000 kilometers on Tesla my first
[30:09] Tesla was 200,000 kilometers in two
[30:11] years so I'm driving a lot as you see
[30:13] wow and if you drive electric I I love
[30:16] electric cars but if you drive so much
[30:18] then Tesla is the only option as you
[30:19] have the superchargers on top of the
[30:22] infrastructure for charging everyone
[30:23] else has and they are between 10 and 100
[30:26] kilom along the highway way so there's a
[30:28] E network so it's easy to drive a Tesla
[30:31] I have days where I drive thousand 1,500
[30:34] kilometers per day and that's not a
[30:37] problem anymore so and it's very
[30:39] comfortable it's silent I love it and
[30:41] and these Teslas they they have fun
[30:43] driving them so I always said the people
[30:45] don't try do a test drive with a Tesla
[30:48] it's highly addictive you you don't want
[30:51] another car no no don't do it simply
[30:53] it's it's like Bitcoin if you're hooked
[30:55] you're hooked and you you will not go
[30:57] back and I also know people who say oh
[31:01] these electric cars I have range anxiety
[31:04] and I don't believe this te technology
[31:06] Will Survive and also we have this um uh
[31:09] political rules where uh I think Europe
[31:12] or some countries in Europe will not
[31:14] allow um cons combustion cars anymore
[31:19] and from 2030 or 35 on I don't I think
[31:23] that's a good idea so the market will uh
[31:25] find the best way and I think I'm
[31:27] convinced electric cars Will Survive
[31:30] that will be at least one model for
[31:32] mobility in the future also they offer a
[31:34] lot of advantages in terms of using the
[31:36] technology and autonomous driving it's
[31:39] better if you have a I would say an
[31:41] iPhone on Wheels really um designed from
[31:44] the scratch as some piece of technology
[31:47] which is also able to drive this is what
[31:49] I enjoy in a Tesla but I know there are
[31:51] different people with different opinions
[31:53] and I'm a fan of discussing also in a
[31:56] very uh construct way and and the the
[32:00] personal opinion must not be aligned
[32:02] it's perfect for me I I have discussions
[32:04] with people about many being vgan uh
[32:07] being uh B Bev driver or even about some
[32:11] polit political aspects but the
[32:14] foundation you use the word the the
[32:16] foundation is Bitcoin if you have
[32:18] bitcoiners you can talk about everything
[32:20] and these people are really okay in
[32:23] every aspect I meet people uh on meetups
[32:26] I meet people colleagues whatever
[32:28] everyone who who at least knows a little
[32:31] bit about Bitcoin I never met some
[32:33] really strange people I have
[32:36] some
[32:37] um yeah strange discussion I would say
[32:40] on Twitter with some Bitcoin is where I
[32:42] know I really like their post about
[32:45] Bitcoin so we are perfectly aligned but
[32:47] then we are really uh pushing each other
[32:50] for some political topics and and
[32:53] sometimes I think it's that's a little
[32:55] bit hard to to do it remote on on
[32:57] Twitter or or in a messenger or so on
[32:59] telegram or whatever signal um I I'm a
[33:02] fan of doing this really face to face
[33:04] and and doing the discussions but back
[33:07] to the topic the bitcoiners are always
[33:08] okay and and you can also discuss
[33:12] controversial topics with bitcoiners and
[33:14] don't having any problem 21 Bitcoin is
[33:17] Bitcoin only from day one and they teach
[33:20] and preach self custody this is my goto
[33:24] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[33:26] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[33:28] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[33:32] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[33:34] support this podcast use code Robin and
[33:37] click the link in the description and I
[33:39] think this is so different to the
[33:41] Bitcoin community and I often wonder uh
[33:43] is it because we're early and we are we
[33:46] really curious or is it because Bitcoin
[33:49] when there's trust back again in our
[33:52] Baseline our money changes something in
[33:55] people so that people also are okay with
[33:58] different opinions I I have no clue to
[34:00] this answer I often ask it I often
[34:03] discuss it on the podcast I have no clue
[34:05] if if we just earlier in a special group
[34:07] and that's why we have this amazing
[34:10] feeling in the community or Bitcoin
[34:12] actually changes something in the
[34:14] society I think it's both as we are all
[34:17] early adopters everyone who is in
[34:19] Bitcoin after it's it's 15 years sounds
[34:21] a lot but it's very very early if if you
[34:24] think we have gold since more than 5,000
[34:26] years we have fear money for thousands
[34:28] of years more or less in terms of
[34:30] whatever this is copper or our today's
[34:33] paper money um so we are early adopters
[34:37] and our mindset I think being an early
[34:40] adopter uh requires an open mindset
[34:43] somehow so so that means and it's not
[34:45] only about understanding Bitcoin using
[34:48] the internet whatever driving an
[34:49] electric car uh using new technology or
[34:52] setting up a node a Bitcoin node I have
[34:54] a node I have two nerd miners here so is
[34:57] always also something I use in my
[34:59] presentations and to show it to people
[35:01] and talk about it and make them
[35:03] understand what it is about so we have a
[35:05] different mindset I think and this
[35:07] is by nature some creates some some
[35:10] openness and creativity on the one hand
[35:13] on the other hand I think once people
[35:15] understand Bitcoin at least a little bit
[35:18] they understand the aspect of
[35:20] Independence
[35:22] decentralization
[35:24] security and all the stuff and and which
[35:26] also mean leads to another kind of
[35:29] mindset which has to be a little bit an
[35:31] open one and of course we
[35:34] bitcoiners after years I also try to
[35:37] find a weakness in the Bitcoin system in
[35:40] the in the network every day so I think
[35:42] about hey all people friends ask me what
[35:45] do you think about this aspect can the
[35:47] the network be hijacked um can it be
[35:50] could there be a 51% attack on it or
[35:53] something and I really think about it
[35:55] every day again and if you think like
[35:57] that uh you're you you understood the
[36:01] aspect of freedom and independency and
[36:04] and
[36:05] decentralization and then is also
[36:07] something which changes mind and to be
[36:08] honest I I never saved money in my past
[36:11] I I I spent it I earned it I spended
[36:14] every every month my bank account was
[36:16] empty since I'm in Bitcoin I'm saving
[36:19] not I'm saving Bitcoin not money so so I
[36:23] do stack every Satoshi I can and I'm
[36:27] saving money and and it's it's feeling
[36:30] good and and it changes the mindset
[36:32] completely so I think this leads to uh
[36:35] what we know as the Bitcoin I would say
[36:38] community spirit and mindset it's a
[36:40] different Spirit but I think these both
[36:43] aspects could could lead to this I don't
[36:45] have the perfect answer but that's my
[36:46] feeling about it I also think uh like
[36:49] Bitcoin is like money uh is so
[36:51] fundamental to our lives uh because it's
[36:54] uh 50% of each human transaction to it
[36:57] like there's always like something you
[36:58] trade and there's some money going
[37:00] around so uh if this fundamental Bas
[37:04] layer of our human beings of our
[37:06] transactions of our interactions is
[37:09] revolutionizing it also will change
[37:11] something in society I'm just not sure
[37:14] how much or
[37:16] how how how how deep the the thing will
[37:19] be because also bitcoiners not change
[37:21] just because they have Bitcoin they also
[37:23] change because they have the exposure to
[37:25] the other bitcoiners and they have again
[37:27] getting to know the arit coning on
[37:29] meetups uh and changing the environment
[37:32] is also changing yourself uh so this is
[37:35] something I'm really looking forward to
[37:37] like uh come back in 20 years Watch the
[37:41] watch the podcast from 20 years and see
[37:43] how how it turned out yeah and after
[37:47] already experiencing the
[37:49] hyperbitcoinization what I think would
[37:51] be a huge aspect for Bitcoin is uh
[37:53] Bitcoin being used for payments in a
[37:56] daily manner so but we are in a bull
[37:58] market so uh since early last year
[38:00] already so we in a bull market for I
[38:02] would say more than a year and the bull
[38:04] run will come and in Bull markets and
[38:06] especially in times of Bull Run you have
[38:08] positive reporting in the press in in in
[38:11] politics okay in EU we have some strange
[38:13] regulations on the way right now uh but
[38:17] uh in general new businesses occur and
[38:20] new businesses who are created during
[38:23] bull markets so people invest in Bitcoin
[38:25] and what will be the results of new
[38:28] business created in a bull market or
[38:30] whatever around Bitcoin typically it
[38:32] happens in a bull market new business
[38:34] always will increase the numbers of
[38:36] Bitcoin users and we have Technologies
[38:39] like Arc or like bit lightning so we
[38:41] have payments layers for Bitcoins and
[38:44] also the the the shops will accept more
[38:47] Bitcoin so what I do talking to people
[38:49] of in restaurant I am ask or people are
[38:52] seeing the sck on my car they say hey
[38:54] how can I get into Bitcoin as a seller
[38:56] and you have no charge back risk so
[38:58] there are many aspects it's it's quick
[39:00] it's cheap uh it's good for for sellers
[39:02] but also for customers you don't have a
[39:04] third party in between you don't have to
[39:06] have any fees um not not more than
[39:10] needed and lightning is is lighning fast
[39:12] and and nearly free of charge and uh
[39:16] it's also somehow some kind of anonymous
[39:18] you have to be careful with this um um
[39:21] wording but uh yeah I have my lightning
[39:23] node and I feel I have my bank at home
[39:25] and I'm part of the network I the
[39:27] blockchain on my Note and this is is a
[39:30] great feeling of of freedom and
[39:32] independency and also it sets us up for
[39:34] the future using Bitcoin not just as a
[39:38] store of value also as a medium of
[39:41] exchange really use it for payments and
[39:44] the the hardcore bitcoiners they are
[39:46] hoodless you know they buy their
[39:47] Bitcoins and never give it away they sit
[39:50] on it and wouldn't spend any but I'm
[39:53] using it heavily so if I track my um
[39:56] transactions in my uh Bitcoin app or in
[39:59] my note I have hundreds of transactions
[40:01] and I try to pay with Bitcoin whenever
[40:04] possible I look for restaurants and for
[40:06] shops where I can pay with Bitcoin but
[40:08] what I do I'm of course I'm also a
[40:10] holder and I do spend and replace uh
[40:12] replace ideally before spending but if I
[40:16] okay if I buy a coffee you know the
[40:18] Bitcoin Forum in Munich where we met
[40:20] face to face year ago or so I I I bought
[40:24] a coffee for some Satoshi so I'm not
[40:27] with replacing this but if it's a b
[40:29] account I I spend and replace just to
[40:31] make people or let people watch hey I
[40:34] now pay with lightning or Bitcoin on
[40:36] chain is a second choice uh but see
[40:39] people see hey you can pay and it's
[40:40] lightning fast and it's working hey cool
[40:43] how can I do this can you install this
[40:44] app to me and yeah I think this also
[40:47] dope and and this will be the future and
[40:49] that will help for uh Bitcoin adoption
[40:51] and hyperbitcoinization and I hope this
[40:54] comes soon but I think as you said maybe
[40:57] in 10 20 years uh we are in a world like
[41:00] this yeah I'm I'm definitely sure that
[41:03] we are coming to a world like this the
[41:05] only thing I'm worried about is not
[41:07] about Bitcoin I'm only a little bit and
[41:09] you teased it a little bit I'm worried
[41:11] about Europe I'm worried about countries
[41:15] or nations not adopting it um they are
[41:18] beautiful like austri I love Austria I
[41:20] love the nature here also of Germany and
[41:23] I would hate to move somewhere else but
[41:26] honestly if there's uh some some
[41:29] regulation I'm like I'm I'm really not
[41:31] sure what's the future holding like with
[41:33] with Bitcoin and what they're doing now
[41:35] because I know they can only do it um
[41:38] short term or medium term but they can
[41:41] really hurt the economy and really hurt
[41:43] the Bitcoin adoption in the country uh
[41:46] and this will just drive people outside
[41:48] of of Austria outside of of Europe how
[41:51] do you see like we already see like in
[41:53] in in in Nigeria we have like uh 30%
[41:56] adoption what do we have in austri and
[41:59] Germany 5% 6% maybe hard to say and then
[42:03] we even have with Switzerland a good uh
[42:06] good uh comparison because it's so
[42:08] comparable with with the people to
[42:10] Austria and Germany in Switzerland we
[42:12] have really good regulations you can pay
[42:14] taxes I I had Beach Bitcoin on a a
[42:17] company in Switzerland they don't even
[42:19] have a bank account I don't know if this
[42:20] is possible Germany a company without
[42:23] the bank account uh but how do you see
[42:26] this whole game theory playing out does
[42:28] does Europe has a chance to be a hub for
[42:31] Bitcoin in the next
[42:33] years yeah I'm also worried about this
[42:36] but not too much worried to be honest as
[42:38] I see we have Miker which was confirmed
[42:41] in May last year will be active end of
[42:45] this year early
[42:47] 2025 which is the EU regulation which I
[42:51] think it's not too bad so I don't plan
[42:53] to do any criminal activities and in
[42:56] Germany we have the chance to not pay
[42:58] taxes I know in Austria they changed the
[43:00] the laws in one and a half years ago if
[43:04] we keep Bitcoin for hold Bitcoin for
[43:06] more than a year we don't have to pay
[43:08] taxes we don't even have to declare and
[43:12] and but this is not no Financial advice
[43:15] I'm not a Tax Advisor any also and but I
[43:20] see the regulations and what's coming
[43:22] now in in Europe what seems to come in
[43:25] 2026 2027
[43:27] that will damage us as a country in
[43:30] terms of it's you EU it's not Germany
[43:33] another country as a region as a
[43:35] territory uh but this is a huge
[43:37] disadvantage compared to the rest of the
[43:39] world especially compared to the US
[43:41] where they're opening and and reducing
[43:44] regulations and even using Bitcoin
[43:46] miners for supporting the the energy
[43:49] grid and so they're really opening up
[43:51] everything while Europe is restricting
[43:54] as much as they can but
[43:57] so most of these things are not hitting
[44:00] us as wallet owners for the moment I see
[44:03] there are some people parties interested
[44:06] in really controlling
[44:07] everything um but I personally I'm
[44:11] always maybe too positive sometimes but
[44:14] I hope that they will row back and and
[44:17] uh they will they will understand uh
[44:20] that this is not a way to be successful
[44:23] as EU um compared to the world so it's
[44:27] really a huge disadvantage and I hope
[44:29] that someone will understand this and
[44:31] have enough power to to uh put it in the
[44:34] trash again this is what I see generally
[44:37] with bitcoiners they are really hopeful
[44:39] and they're really positive on the
[44:40] future uh they are they're cautious with
[44:43] with when it comes to regulation when it
[44:45] comes to to all this stuff but because
[44:48] they are cautious they can be really
[44:49] hopeful because they know they are safe
[44:52] they have Bitcoin they have the the
[44:53] measurements in in in in in place what
[44:56] I'm curious about and I should have
[44:57] asked it way earlier how did you
[45:00] actually discover
[45:02] Bitcoin who orange bu the orange
[45:06] pillow wow yeah to be honest I don't
[45:10] really remember um I read about Bitcoin
[45:13] I was curious and I know several people
[45:16] having Bitcoin many years ago my son had
[45:19] thousands of Bitcoin years ago but uh he
[45:23] also sold it later on he just used it in
[45:26] the darket to buy some strange stuff he
[45:28] told me he's 30 years old now and he
[45:31] told me maybe a year ago Hey Dad I just
[45:34] wanted to buy this and that in the dark
[45:35] net and we had some Bitcoin but he also
[45:38] invested maybe what what was it six
[45:40] seven years ago he put put 6,000 EUR
[45:42] together with a friend and bought
[45:43] Bitcoin and then they had
[45:46] 100,000 within less than a year the
[45:48] problem was they wanted to sell and they
[45:50] were afraid of the taxes and they didn't
[45:52] sell and they changed to some
[45:54] alternative coins is the proper word for
[45:57] for a podcast and uh and and they lost a
[46:00] lot so they also won some money but uh
[46:03] yeah so I was in contact with several
[46:06] people using Bitcoin in the past and
[46:07] reading books early and I don't know who
[46:11] there was no person uh and and who was
[46:14] responsible to orange pill me so I I
[46:17] went to be a fan over the years and and
[46:19] always deeper and as I mentioned so
[46:21] since maybe
[46:22] 2018 I'm spending hours per day in
[46:25] Bitcoin reading every book and um heing
[46:28] many podcasts like your YouTube channel
[46:31] tracking you on Twitter I really can
[46:33] suggest you as as a source of
[46:35] information about Bitcoin in every
[46:37] aspect I really love this and yeah we
[46:39] have in the meantime we have some
[46:42] channels also German language and and
[46:44] use is happy I'm very happy to have an
[46:47] international Channel as well to really
[46:49] address as as I one of the most
[46:52] fascinating books for me was Alex gladin
[46:54] Bitcoin the tryan horse for freedom I
[46:57] don't know whether this is really the
[46:58] English title I heard is a little bit
[47:00] different in German
[47:03] it's and this is a really great book in
[47:06] covering all the aspects of of the world
[47:09] the different countries and what happens
[47:11] there I learned a lot about dictatorship
[47:13] what could I do as a dictator in in in a
[47:16] specific situation with countries or
[47:18] people in a country especially with the
[47:20] poor people making me richer and richer
[47:24] and yeah I know this Bitcoin is an
[47:26] international to toic it's not a
[47:28] regional or country specific topic and
[47:30] this is good and this is great and this
[47:32] is one of the advantages of Bitcoin is
[47:34] some government or institution or
[47:37] whatever switch tries to switch off or
[47:41] not disallowing to use Bitcoin then the
[47:44] rest of the world will work and even if
[47:46] they for for forbidding the mining there
[47:49] will be some small mining Farms I don't
[47:51] know in Nigeria in Ethiopia in I don't
[47:55] know an island using free energy
[47:59] of whatever water power and they will
[48:04] continue the network and this is also by
[48:07] Design uh from Satoshi Nakamoto in the
[48:10] network whenever even a huge part of the
[48:13] network is Switched Off the rest will
[48:16] work and it's even more interesting for
[48:17] the remaining miners to continue the
[48:19] work so uh miners will put their old
[48:22] Hardware out off out of their garage and
[48:26] and react acate them and they they earn
[48:28] more money so it's really exciting uh
[48:32] what what Bitcoin is by Design and what
[48:34] it brings in terms of freedom and
[48:36] security and yeah
[48:39] resilience also I mean the best example
[48:42] for that was I think in 2021 when China
[48:45] banned it or like yeah tried to yeah in
[48:49] the hash rate and for two weeks or so
[48:52] yeah then back to the a two weeks dip
[48:55] and then back to the alltime highs and
[48:56] now we have I think it's more than 600
[49:00] EXA EXA hes now so I heard it's Peak
[49:03] again always alltime high hi yeah hash
[49:05] you can post the chart every day with an
[49:07] alltime high it seems like yeah
[49:10] right yeah but by Design it's
[49:13] interesting even if hash rate goes down
[49:14] for some reason China disallows uh
[49:17] Mining and us is currently the biggest
[49:21] uh mining country but even if they would
[49:24] bu allowed to to do mining with Bitcoin
[49:27] others will pop up even with old
[49:30] hardware and continue enabling the
[49:33] network and this is exciting yeah
[49:36] definitely um speaking of exciting what
[49:40] what do you think is like the mo most
[49:42] exciting news that will come out in the
[49:45] of of course you don't know but what do
[49:47] you think is the most exciting news that
[49:49] will come out in the next few years or
[49:51] what what are you looking forward in
[49:54] Bitcoin uh that will probably have in
[49:57] the next one two three years of stuff we
[49:59] probably we we already know of stuff
[50:01] that we might not know what do you
[50:03] expect Bitcoin being in the next couple
[50:08] years yeah so we had the ETFs we will
[50:12] have other ETFs etns I heard yesterday
[50:14] or the day before came news about London
[50:17] and Hong Kong which are really huge
[50:19] financial markets also um offering ETFs
[50:24] so institutional or or yeah ETF you can
[50:27] also invest as a small investor you can
[50:29] invest $200 in an ETF so it's not only
[50:33] the bigger ones but the bigger ones
[50:34] create the the biggest volumes and the
[50:36] retail Market will jump in one day a
[50:38] little bit later the Pension funds so
[50:40] this is something where I see huge
[50:43] traction um we will have the fasb so the
[50:46] accounting rules with the balance sheets
[50:48] for um
[50:51] optimizing uh having crypto uh of course
[50:55] we focus on Bitcoin in in the balance
[50:57] sheet for companies in in us which will
[51:00] definitely be a push end of that this
[51:02] year we'll have the smaller financial
[51:04] advisors jumping into the ETFs but I
[51:07] also see especially the um in the bull
[51:10] market creating new business models
[51:12] creating new businesses and using
[51:15] Bitcoin more for payments that that will
[51:18] be a huge potion I see this coming with
[51:21] new businesses new business models that
[51:23] will be all around adoption of Bitcoins
[51:27] in some way and
[51:29] also new technologies like optimizing
[51:32] lightning or Arc or other payment layers
[51:35] so I see that there are things coming
[51:38] making the handle handling of Bitcoin
[51:41] much easier you know like like strike
[51:43] from Jack M so you
[51:45] can you can discuss whether this is
[51:48] really uh Bitcoin but it uses Bitcoin so
[51:51] if you say hey I want to send 100 euros
[51:54] to my aunt in Japan I put in stri I put1
[51:57] EUR and it's converting to Bitcoin in
[51:59] real time and converting in Japanese gen
[52:02] again and my aunt can get this Japanese
[52:03] gen in the same second and it's using
[52:06] Bitcoin but it's ease of use and this is
[52:08] important for people who are afraid of
[52:11] handling their seed phrase uh what is
[52:14] about if I lose my Hardware wallet in a
[52:16] boating accident of course so an Insider
[52:19] but yeah this is something e ofuse is
[52:21] very much important but I see this will
[52:23] come over the time and that will lead to
[52:25] adoption so this is the major topics I
[52:27] would say I see it's interesting that I
[52:30] think Bitcoin as the payment networks is
[52:34] still uh not discussed enough uh we
[52:37] always speak of the asset we always
[52:39] speak of Bitcoin I'm go up technology of
[52:41] the asset nobody can take it away from
[52:43] you this is like really highly discussed
[52:46] but Bitcoin the network uh it's
[52:49] something that will come up in the next
[52:51] like 5 10 years especially with like the
[52:54] layer Technologies making payments
[52:56] easier
[52:57] better making extremely good
[52:59] applications on top of it which makes it
[53:01] also good and this leads me to to the do
[53:04] the end routine we have an end routine
[53:06] in the in the
[53:08] podcast where the previous guest is
[53:10] asking a question for the next guest and
[53:13] it's a it's a cool question and it's
[53:15] it's kind of connected to to the
[53:17] payments which year do you think will be
[53:20] the last Merchants accepting Visa or
[53:23] Mastercard payments or like not
[53:25] accepting Master Card Payments got it
[53:31] 20
[53:34] 45 so 20 years from now
[53:39] 2045 yeah we will have a change in in
[53:41] the currency I think in the Euro and the
[53:44] dollar I don't believe they will survive
[53:47] very long now maybe they could crash and
[53:50] be replaced by something and U Visa
[53:53] credit card
[53:54] transactions maybe 20 years
[53:57] oh interesting yeah I think I always I
[54:01] usually ask the question like when will
[54:03] fear die yeah and and there's different
[54:07] uh answers to that question my biggest
[54:12] the biggest question that still coming
[54:15] out but when this is coming out this is
[54:17] uh this will come out uh is I think who
[54:20] was it La who said it will only survive
[54:22] the next three years and he gave his
[54:25] theory on on why only three years uh
[54:28] there are also people Bitcoin they
[54:30] saying oh no no it will like we live on
[54:32] for 100 years we don't we will not live
[54:34] to that uh but it's interesting uh most
[54:37] bitcoiners are saying between 10 and 30
[54:40] years I think like this is the most
[54:43] people go also if I was wondering what
[54:47] is a credit card so if happens what I
[54:50] just pointed out what could happen is
[54:53] that we replace the Euro with something
[54:54] else another currency the euro2 or
[54:57] whatever and then a credit card can
[55:00] remain but if we change from euro2 to
[55:05] bitcoin maybe also the credit card will
[55:08] somehow survive but um the currency is
[55:11] not Euro or Euro two it's Bitcoin then
[55:15] so yeah then it's I have some some um
[55:20] lightning card just looks like a credit
[55:23] card and it's connected to an app I
[55:24] forgot the name coin something and it's
[55:27] also like a credit card and but if we
[55:29] talk credit cards in Fiat money and then
[55:31] I would say 20 years hopefully less way
[55:36] less yeah of course like MasterCard can
[55:39] also say like oh we're seeing feat
[55:42] going let's let's switch to bitcoin
[55:45] let's find a way how we canra Bitcoin on
[55:48] our cards and make Bitcoin payments
[55:51] possible all around the world transition
[55:53] to bitcoin then this is what I meant
[55:55] yeah right perfect
[55:56] then uh thank you Larry for being on uh
[55:59] um for for people that want to ask you
[56:02] questions is there any way they can they
[56:04] can reach out to you is there any uh
[56:06] profile you want to be like oh if you
[56:08] have questions uh ask me
[56:11] there yeah of course uh you can uh
[56:15] mention my Twitter handle Twitter I'm a
[56:18] bitcoiner on on Twitter but with a
[56:19] special writing with some numbers in in
[56:22] it not sure you can put it in in the
[56:24] notes somewhere that would would be the
[56:27] easiest way I would say perfect perfect
