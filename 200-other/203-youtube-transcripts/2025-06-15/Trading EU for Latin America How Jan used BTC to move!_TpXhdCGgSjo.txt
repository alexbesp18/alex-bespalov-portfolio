[00:00] Bitcoin is freedom because I needed to
[00:02] transact between continents why did you
[00:05] choose to go out of the EU and go to
[00:08] Latin America in Europe it's totally
[00:10] crazy when you put everything in in a
[00:12] one basket like a social security and uh
[00:15] you put a health insurance which is
[00:17] effectively a tax when you put all the
[00:19] income taxes capital gain taxes property
[00:22] taxes and so on Europe is under the
[00:24] heavy taxation I would say it's
[00:26] crumbling step by step the Europe is
[00:29] crumbling why why they are not aware of
[00:31] that is because like a lot of taxes are
[00:33] not being called taxes the only option
[00:36] how to be Sovereign how to have a
[00:38] freedom when [ __ ] hits the fan so is
[00:41] that you have Bitcoin under your own
[00:43] control ideally you want more
[00:45] citizenships not relying on just one
[00:48] citizenship you never know what's going
[00:49] to happen having Bitcoin you feel
[00:52] definitely safer than having fat money
[00:54] in the bank it's not about market cap
[00:56] it's about that freedom I don't need to
[00:58] have a permission to trans for you
[01:04] value why is Bitcoin for you Freedom
[01:07] money ah okay so I my perception or Al
[01:12] also like how I got into the Bitcoin
[01:14] basically and it's stuck to me till
[01:17] today is because for me Bitcoin is
[01:20] freedom because I need it uh to transact
[01:24] between continents and basically because
[01:27] my life is mostly in Latin in America
[01:31] it's pretty hard to go with a standard
[01:34] traditional payment rails and when I
[01:38] discovered the Bitcoin so it was the
[01:40] answer so then problem solved basically
[01:43] from day one to another day problem
[01:46] solved of course in the beginning there
[01:49] was no lightning Network and so on but
[01:51] still you didn't have to ask any
[01:54] authority to say I want to transfer $100
[01:59] from one continent to another continent
[02:01] waiting for five days uh pay what
[02:06] ridiculous percent from that $100 just
[02:09] to rail your payment and often times it
[02:12] happens that it's not even arriving and
[02:14] they say hey there is a problem with a
[02:16] correspondent bank and it's going back
[02:19] to your original account so you can try
[02:21] it again so uh for me it was a really
[02:25] need of transferring value from one
[02:29] country to another in an easy manner
[02:32] without asking a permission in couple of
[02:34] minutes or these days even a seconds so
[02:37] yeah that that was definitely the
[02:40] attraction for me and you as so so you
[02:44] got it first as a payment Network to
[02:46] bitcoin and not as a all number gr
[02:49] technology store value savings
[02:51] technology exactly like I understand The
[02:55] Narrative of store value and I think
[02:58] that's a pretty strong narrative in
[03:00] let's say Europe and us because like
[03:03] still if you you know it from from your
[03:07] uh side right if you want to make a a
[03:10] payment from Austria to Spain so then
[03:12] there's no problem because you make a
[03:14] sepa payment and uh it's there like
[03:17] within an hour and there is no fee
[03:20] related to that so that's not a problem
[03:22] in Europe actually the problem becomes
[03:25] when we wants to do like
[03:26] InterContinental payments and that's why
[03:30] okay store of value is nice but that's
[03:32] not like a main point why I got into the
[03:35] Bitcoin so it was like real motivation
[03:37] of transferring money and not asking
[03:39] anybody else if I can do it or not and
[03:42] why I shouldn't do it and I don't like
[03:45] it and somebody else doesn't like that
[03:47] so no asking for permission and I know
[03:51] that it arrives and it's there like
[03:53] within 10 minutes let's put it this way
[03:56] yeah that's an it's an amazing feature
[03:58] of Bitcoin that
[04:00] I think gets not covered enough like the
[04:02] the the use case is like most people
[04:05] stay in their own country or their
[04:07] jurisdiction their whole life or at
[04:09] least they don't move uh around too much
[04:12] uh so they never really have to to
[04:14] figure out oh how how do I send the
[04:16] payment from uh I don't know Honduras to
[04:19] Austria and then to Australia like there
[04:22] there a lot of fees involved with the
[04:23] Fiat system even though it's just the
[04:25] database entry and there's nothing
[04:28] physical uh no physical uh settlement
[04:31] layer in in the Fiat system at least I
[04:33] see it like that um it's really
[04:35] interesting and you also um moved
[04:37] yourself uh from originally check uh uh
[04:41] which is really like I can I can even
[04:43] hear that check in in in your voice to
[04:46] now uh to to Latin America right yeah
[04:50] like uh yeah I'm in Latin America like
[04:53] for 20 years oh wow so so long already
[04:58] when did you come there
[05:01] uh it was like 2005 or six yeah five I
[05:05] guess so and and honestly I've tried to
[05:07] live in a couple of countries so it was
[05:09] not just one spot and and I would say
[05:13] it's a
[05:15] NeverEnding seek for the best country
[05:19] where to stay where to live so I've
[05:22] already lived in couple of the there I
[05:24] don't know eight nine countries uh in
[05:27] Latin America and yeah
[05:30] like seeking for where is the best to
[05:33] stay and maybe I will never ever stay in
[05:36] one country uh yeah now doing itate a
[05:40] family and and so yeah we're we're we're
[05:42] trying to move to a country try to live
[05:47] there would we like about it if we don't
[05:49] like it so we move again to another one
[05:52] so it's a yeah never ending seeking for
[05:56] I don't know like Haven some kind of
[06:00] like a best place where to live and
[06:02] where you can take all the boxes what we
[06:06] have on our kind of like list uh yeah so
[06:10] there is a and still keep going like
[06:13] yeah it never ended what is that list
[06:16] for you it's interesting because I'm uh
[06:18] started that research process uh as I'm
[06:21] since this year binded by a like till
[06:25] this year I was buying to a place like
[06:27] Austria with my job but since this year
[06:30] I'm not that anymore so like I started
[06:32] like I think a month ago or two weeks
[06:34] ago or something like that to research
[06:36] about different countries and there are
[06:37] so many different options and it's it's
[06:40] kind of
[06:40] overwhelming uh and and I I'm still in
[06:43] the just Gathering options face and
[06:46] seeing what is even possible um how did
[06:49] you start the process why did you start
[06:51] the process and and what is like your
[06:54] your list looking of like oh I want this
[06:56] in a country or I want this in a country
[06:59] I would say that it's going to be a like
[07:02] pretty specific for every individual
[07:04] because like everybody has a different
[07:06] needs and and
[07:08] motivations so it's going to be hard to
[07:13] like copy and paste to somebody else but
[07:18] okay first thing I will put it from this
[07:20] perspective I uh okay I end up in Latin
[07:23] America because of uh like uh many
[07:26] reasons it was not a Asia for me never
[07:30] because Latin America gives me the
[07:32] benefits uh we speak Spanish at home so
[07:35] uh there is no language barrier that's
[07:37] the first thing okay except Brazil where
[07:40] you need to speak Portuguese but other
[07:43] than that uh a whole Latin America
[07:45] Spanish speaking second thing is that
[07:48] you can blend in so not just like a from
[07:51] a physical appearance how you can blend
[07:55] with uh not all of them but let's say
[07:58] the majority of them you can easily
[08:00] blend in also like from the cultural
[08:03] perspective so it's not that different
[08:06] culturally like in Latin America let's
[08:08] say compared to Europe and uh also like
[08:12] many Latin American countries have a lot
[08:15] of European Heritage so there is not
[08:17] that big like a clash cultural Clash
[08:20] that you would need to adapt to
[08:23] something maybe you don't like so it's
[08:25] also easy and the last part I would say
[08:29] is that I'm like seeking for freedom in
[08:32] terms of like real Freedom so uh to put
[08:36] it into perspective like a lot of people
[08:39] are putting into high on the list like a
[08:42] freedom and
[08:43] safety and uh this is something what is
[08:48] like going against each other a little
[08:50] bit so uh I'm going to put it this way
[08:53] Latin America there are countries in
[08:55] Latin America that are pretty safe uh
[08:58] obviously no not let's say the same
[09:01] safety like uh let's say uh United
[09:04] Emirates right but that's the point so
[09:09] you're looking for where you have a
[09:12] maximum freedom and you can somehow find
[09:15] a crossover with some certain level of
[09:19] safety where you feel fine so what I for
[09:23] example don't about don't like about um
[09:26] United
[09:27] Emirates is that
[09:30] there is a super safety everywhere there
[09:32] are cctvs everywhere if you go like
[09:37] maybe 10 miles an hour faster than you
[09:40] should go in a car so immediately there
[09:42] is going to be a fine in your mailbox
[09:45] and you have to pay for it so you pay
[09:48] for your safety with no Freedom at all
[09:52] so you're tracked everywhere on every
[09:54] step you do and where you going and
[09:57] that's the difference with Latin America
[09:59] where you have like more freedom to do
[10:02] things and I'm not talking about doing
[10:04] some ilicit activity so it's not an
[10:06] illicit activity they like doing
[10:08] something wrong it's just about like
[10:10] nobody's like putting me in the place
[10:13] and saying hey you cannot do this and we
[10:16] are following you and we are watching
[10:18] you and you can't go that way and you
[10:20] need to go another way so you getting
[10:24] safety and trying to find some Crossover
[10:27] with uh freedom and and that freedom on
[10:30] my list is definitely higher than that
[10:32] safety what what do you think of of
[10:34] Switzerland as it's not in the EU as uh
[10:37] more more bitcoiners seem to to like it
[10:40] especially Al with Lugano they're
[10:41] adopting a lot of Bitcoin I think in
[10:43] some contants you can even pay in
[10:46] Bitcoin with taxes like from Bitcoin
[10:48] perspective I believe it's uh going to
[10:50] work uh on the other hand uh if you go
[10:53] not that far from Switzerland in Europe
[10:55] uh in Czech Republic uh is that you can
[10:58] easily live from Bitcoin these days so
[11:01] you got a more than thousand restaurants
[11:03] where you can pay bit Bitcoin you have
[11:06] like a electronics and a consumer goods
[11:09] uh big online store where you can pay
[11:11] with Bitcoin you got a even like a food
[11:14] delivery buying a groceries where you
[11:16] can pay with Bitcoin or you can buy a
[11:19] gift card with Bitcoin that can be paid
[11:22] on that grocery store so I mean like
[11:24] paying uh living from Bitcoin it's
[11:25] already possible in in Europe like
[11:28] Switzerland is not my type of country
[11:33] and not from a reason of like there
[11:35] would be that many restrictions but I
[11:39] need more like Vivid country where it's
[11:42] uh more living Lively something's moving
[11:46] so Latin America is like closer to my
[11:49] heart definitely and second thing is
[11:52] that from the better perspective oh man
[11:55] like Switzerland is not not my style I
[11:58] mean uh
[11:59] okay I hate winter I hate winter totally
[12:03] so for example when Europe's coming to
[12:06] Autumn and getting a little bit like
[12:08] snowy and frosty it's definitely the
[12:11] time to leave Europe and not being in
[12:14] Europe till spring so um that's why
[12:17] Switzerland is like out of the box like
[12:21] for me it's no
[12:22] goal yeah that's that that's a very fair
[12:25] assumption I mean I I live kind of love
[12:28] I see Austria always is the is the
[12:30] Switzerland with the EU and Switzerland
[12:32] is kind of the Austria without the EU
[12:35] because there's like landscape wise both
[12:38] countries are really beautiful it's it's
[12:40] very clean and very calmed down um I
[12:43] think it's a little bit more hectic in
[12:45] Austria a little bit more than than in
[12:47] Switzerland uh I don't know why I think
[12:50] that but Switzerland is really a nice
[12:54] country if you want to have a a nice
[12:56] relaxed calm life uh with a lot of
[12:59] mountains and Hikes and lakes and and
[13:01] that kind of a life but yeah definitely
[13:03] it's it's the the calmness has the
[13:05] disadvantage of that there's not a lot
[13:07] going on there Latin America is is 100%
[13:10] way more lively in in in that regard if
[13:13] you value that but from a uh perspective
[13:16] of because I see it also I think
[13:19] yesterday I saw two different posts from
[13:22] two different people uh one from Germany
[13:25] I forgot the other country there saying
[13:27] like oh I just signed off from Germany I
[13:30] I'm never coming back let's see where it
[13:33] drives me I see like that that kind of
[13:35] shift of outside of the EU outside of
[13:37] Canada outside of the US to Asia to
[13:41] Latin America to even Switzerland to to
[13:44] countries like that like why do you
[13:45] think is that and why did you choose to
[13:48] go out of the EU and go to Latin
[13:51] America like the reason why it's
[13:53] happening is like uh European Union is
[13:56] becoming like over regulated and instead
[13:59] of leaving it like just on people on a
[14:02] society to solve issues that might
[14:06] happen like 90% of those issues can be
[14:09] solved even faster better cheaper like
[14:12] within the society instead of over
[14:13] regulating something because the
[14:15] Market's going to solve it the one way
[14:17] or the other so that's the problem with
[14:21] a with the EU if something's coming new
[14:24] so we are scared we are going to
[14:25] regulate it okay we need to have
[14:28] everything under control control uh uh
[14:31] also like with uh losing freedom in in
[14:36] European Union uh so all those issues
[14:40] are driving people outside and they are
[14:43] then okay maybe seeking for Asia or
[14:46] Latin America like I told you Asia for
[14:48] me is hard to grasp because of I can't
[14:50] like really get in there and not being a
[14:54] tourist uh so that's not my style I'm
[14:57] not saying it's not possible it's it's
[14:59] definitely possible but not my style
[15:01] Latin America is a huge continent and
[15:05] not maybe just a South America but also
[15:08] like a Caribbean so all that is Spanish
[15:11] speaking and you can just easily move
[15:13] from one country to another and if
[15:15] you're resident in mercosur you got a
[15:18] like kind of like a similar movement of
[15:21] individuals like in European Union so
[15:24] you're resident of one one mosur country
[15:26] so you can go to another America country
[15:29] like with the ID card only so you got a
[15:32] really like a huge optionality within
[15:35] Latin America where you can move live
[15:38] you don't like it there you can maybe
[15:39] like it in another one yeah so uh that's
[15:43] uh and it's more laidback like in terms
[15:47] of less stress and not saying that it's
[15:51] everything late but there is just a
[15:55] definitely lesser stress than in Europe
[15:58] and second thing what I can find in
[16:01] Latin America is that there is so much
[16:04] things that you can build because
[16:07] obviously it's not on the same level
[16:08] like in Europe uh Latin America has a
[16:11] long way to grow and there are like a
[16:14] lot of services that are Miss Missing
[16:17] there there are like a lot of uh
[16:19] products that are missing on the market
[16:22] so you're you're there that you can for
[16:24] example come up with your whatever
[16:26] startup idea and you can start
[16:28] implementing it in Latin America country
[16:31] and definitely you're going to have a
[16:34] success because there's not so much
[16:36] competition like in the US like or in
[16:38] Europe and everybody's going to be happy
[16:41] because like those countries are with
[16:44] those exports that want to do something
[16:47] and want to contribute to the country so
[16:50] those countries are growing up they are
[16:52] just having a better value for for other
[16:55] people like hey that that that wasn't
[16:57] here like before now was here okay like
[17:00] you know you you name it like now you
[17:02] can have whatever groceries delivered
[17:05] like with a bolt or Uber but there is no
[17:09] like a good e-commerce in many countries
[17:11] that might be delivering like
[17:13] Electronics or other consumer stuff that
[17:16] still waiting to be built I would say
[17:18] I'm not I cannot say it like generally
[17:20] because that's a huge country oh country
[17:23] it's a huge continent like I said but
[17:25] there are still countries that they are
[17:26] underdeveloped and have a potential
[17:29] so why not and I think there are
[17:32] probably a lot of uh things that you
[17:34] might see now in Europe or the USA that
[17:37] you can bring to Latin America and and
[17:40] and close the gap a little bit like as
[17:42] you said that the services and products
[17:43] that are missing really cool how are the
[17:46] the taxes there how is the tax system
[17:49] there is it as mad as in Europe or is it
[17:52] way better uh definitely not but that
[17:54] depends country country from country so
[17:56] it's hard to generalize everything and
[17:59] put everything into one
[18:01] basket uh but there are like countries
[18:04] two popular countries in Latin America
[18:06] for a lot of exports or Nomads are uh
[18:10] Uruguay and Paraguay so uh Uruguay if
[18:16] you move there you got like a tax
[18:18] holidays for like 11 years so you don't
[18:20] have to pay taxes for afforded period of
[18:23] time and in case of Paraguay uh there is
[18:27] a territorial taxation which means uh
[18:30] you pay taxes from a local income but
[18:34] all the income that comes from abroad is
[18:36] not taxed so it is uh like uh there are
[18:41] a lot of benefits for a lot of people
[18:43] that's why there are a lot of people
[18:45] moving there at least partially because
[18:48] they can spend what they earned in a
[18:52] abroad and spending it in the local
[18:54] economy for example or they can start
[18:56] building something on on top of it uh
[18:59] similar can be uh other other countries
[19:03] that they are also territorial taxation
[19:05] system but uh the thing is we would need
[19:08] to go country by country but if we put
[19:11] it like in in the perspective that we
[19:13] got a like us that is even ba uh
[19:17] citizenship citizenship tax based system
[19:21] which means that anywhere in the world
[19:23] you're liveing you need to pay taxes to
[19:25] the US which is the worst case scenario
[19:29] in Europe it's uh like a residency tax
[19:32] residency based system but on the other
[19:34] hand in Europe it's totally crazy you
[19:36] know like one of the highest taxes
[19:38] probably are in the Denmark when you put
[19:40] everything in in in one basket like a
[19:42] social security and uh you put health
[19:46] insurance which is effectively a tax uh
[19:49] when you put all the income taxes
[19:51] capital gain taxes property taxes and so
[19:53] on so Europe is under the heavy kind of
[19:59] like Taxation and like you know I'm just
[20:02] waiting for the moment where I don't
[20:04] know if you're aare of the laer curve
[20:06] laugher curve saying like when you reach
[20:08] a certain point of a taxation in
[20:11] percentage so even though you raise uh
[20:14] taxes higher you're going to earn as a
[20:17] government less money because more and
[20:19] more people like start start to leave
[20:21] the country so what's going to happen is
[20:24] that you got to a certain Tipping Point
[20:26] it's like a kind of Goan curve it goes
[20:29] in the middle on the top and then you
[20:32] you get the maximum income from taxes
[20:35] and when you reach the whatever from 40%
[20:38] to 50 then a lot of people say okay you
[20:41] know what f it I'm leaving and they are
[20:44] leaving away from the country and they
[20:46] are starting to pay taxes anywhere else
[20:48] so effectively what's happening is that
[20:50] the country is getting less taxes in a
[20:53] total value because a lot of uh High net
[20:56] worth individuals are leaving the tax
[20:58] system
[20:59] and uh and I believe that now in in
[21:02] Norway uh they put in effect uh exit tax
[21:08] for their tax residents so when you want
[21:11] to leave Norway you have to pay exit tax
[21:14] like certain amount of your assets just
[21:17] to be able to leave the tax system
[21:19] because they are scared of high net
[21:20] worth individuals leaving High teex
[21:23] Country so it's it's I I would say it's
[21:26] crumbling you know step by step Europe
[21:29] is like crumbling in that perspective
[21:32] yeah that's that's very true and it's uh
[21:34] it's interesting for me taxes because I
[21:36] never thought about taxes uh till this
[21:39] year and this year I thought about it
[21:41] because in Austria taxes always taken
[21:44] care of the uh of the employer side when
[21:47] you are employed but when you're
[21:48] self-employed or you have a business or
[21:50] something like that of course then you
[21:51] have to pay the taxes yourself you have
[21:53] to care that and just paying your taxes
[21:57] yourself question makes you question the
[21:59] tax and all of the sudden uh even though
[22:02] you pay less than an employee pays
[22:04] you're like oh [ __ ] no I don't want to
[22:06] pay that much taxes and it's like oh
[22:08] wait H how how can I avoid that like how
[22:10] how is there other other options out
[22:12] there so I think like a big part of why
[22:15] they are not repellant on the streets
[22:17] especially in Austria and especially in
[22:18] other countries is because they don't
[22:20] even know how much taxes they pay if I
[22:22] asking around in my family and friend
[22:25] Circle and ask oh what's your tax rate
[22:28] they don't know they they they guess
[22:30] maybe like ballpark numbers uh but they
[22:33] don't look every month on their salary
[22:36] slip they they just know what what comes
[22:37] to your what comes to their bank account
[22:40] that's what uh matters to them they
[22:42] don't know how much they they miss out
[22:44] on because they pay in a high tax uh
[22:46] residency that's it's it's it's crazy
[22:49] for me and this interesting thing that
[22:51] you said with the the point where people
[22:52] leave yeah and and another thing is like
[22:55] why they are not aware of that is
[22:57] because like a lot of taxes are not
[22:59] being called taxes so that's why you
[23:01] know like if you properly put words
[23:05] instead of like security like I got a
[23:08] health insurance okay it's effectively a
[23:11] tax that is like being among the whole
[23:14] nation living in that territory uh the
[23:18] same is with Social Security you're
[23:20] putting into the one basket everything
[23:22] and then out of that basket there is
[23:25] being paid when you are retired but it's
[23:27] effectively a tax you're paying a tax
[23:31] that maybe in the future you can benefit
[23:33] out of that obviously it's it's a scheme
[23:36] that's not going to work in 20 30 years
[23:39] uh it's no way to make that happen but
[23:43] uh because of not being called tax a lot
[23:46] of people don't see it as a tax so
[23:49] that's one reason and the second reason
[23:53] uh all people should ask okay if I'm
[23:56] paying that amount of taxes what you
[23:59] getting for it okay what you getting
[24:02] have that question okay that that I
[24:03] would say that's fair question if you're
[24:05] getting a like a fair amount of services
[24:09] or fair amount of support for
[24:13] those what dozens of percents you're
[24:16] paying and you say okay fine I I don't
[24:18] have a problem with that but if you're
[24:21] getting nothing or really low value and
[24:24] you paying a high percentage then it's
[24:26] not making a sense right so that's a
[24:29] good question you said okay I don't even
[24:31] know like okay I don't want to pay it
[24:32] how to avoid it exactly because probably
[24:34] you are not happy with the result what
[24:37] you're getting while what the amount
[24:40] you're paying right so there is like a
[24:43] discrepancy between between the payment
[24:45] and and the service there are a lot of
[24:47] things that I want to bring up the first
[24:49] thing because I just love that example
[24:51] so much in Austria you have to pay uh
[24:56] directly the local news stations uh a
[25:00] fee that you have to pay s since I think
[25:03] like a few months or like a half a year
[25:05] or something like that uh this was
[25:07] optional if you have a television that
[25:10] can have can uh get that signal you have
[25:14] to pay it but if you get rid of all your
[25:17] televisions and just watch online things
[25:20] you could you could opt out of that but
[25:22] since like a few months it's not
[25:25] optional anymore and you have to pay I
[25:28] don't know what is it uh 1520 EUR per
[25:32] month uh to to Austria to have a local
[25:36] news and the I I really don't like the
[25:38] local news because it's also really
[25:39] really really bad and I just got that
[25:42] mail that I have to pay that now like a
[25:45] week ago and like that that's how they
[25:47] promote it that's just like a really
[25:49] small example I mean it's 15 EUR per
[25:51] month it's not like 10% of your salary
[25:54] but that there are so many small
[25:57] examples of of that I mean Social
[25:59] Security and stuff like that is also an
[26:00] example of of that but uh it's it's it's
[26:03] crazy when you really look at it and
[26:05] what you pay in in in in Social Security
[26:08] there's like pension in there there's
[26:10] like Medicare in there and then I'm like
[26:13] okay pension I have Bitcoin as pension I
[26:16] don't need anything else I my pension is
[26:18] Bitcoin so I only need Medicare okay
[26:20] what what do I pay for Medicare in
[26:22] Austria it's depending on your salary
[26:25] then I was like oh that's a huge huge
[26:27] thing that I'm paying that I'm like
[26:29] searching like uh because like maybe
[26:31] also Nomad and stuff like that what are
[26:34] private insurances costing uh that are
[26:37] covering worldwide that's lower that's a
[26:41] better and and it's it's like what what
[26:44] are we what are we supporting here like
[26:47] a huge system that has just a water hat
[26:49] yes that's that's I guess it is I I I
[26:52] got a I can see it from both uh sides
[26:56] like your yourself and and my side
[26:58] because like of course like I I got some
[27:01] right relations to Europe and also
[27:04] living in Latin America so uh for
[27:07] example that your tax on TV it's the
[27:10] same BS uh in Czech Republic so it's
[27:14] obligatory it's mandatory to pay for a
[27:16] TV even though you don't consume that uh
[27:20] that
[27:22] information uh and I don't know what is
[27:24] the amount because like I don't live uh
[27:27] in Czech Republic so uh I I don't know
[27:30] what is the number but still it's a tax
[27:31] you have to pay it and now if I'm not
[27:33] mistaken what happened was that they put
[27:36] that tax also on a mobile devices
[27:38] because you can consume that information
[27:40] from from the TV these days on a mobile
[27:43] devices so anybody who has a mobile
[27:45] device needs to pay the tax from that TV
[27:49] whatever you call it so it's totally BS
[27:53] that I mean like if you don't want to
[27:55] consume that content so they don't pay
[27:58] for it right but this is exactly what I
[28:01] think many people hate about Europe
[28:03] because some stupid regulations are like
[28:07] telling you how to live your life the
[28:09] same is like you said with the with the
[28:11] healthcare it's the same same stuff
[28:13] you're paying not based on your health
[28:18] situation if you're training if you're
[28:21] eating good you're not smoking you're
[28:23] not drinking okay your body composition
[28:27] is in a good shape everything's uh
[28:29] topnotch so your health insurance should
[28:34] be based on your physical state right
[28:37] but instead of that you're paying your
[28:40] health insurance based on how much you
[28:42] earn
[28:44] which what how I mean it can't really be
[28:48] this way so you can be fat you can be
[28:52] whatever uh I mean like really be high
[28:56] uh probability that you're going to need
[28:58] need a medical care but you're earning
[29:00] almost nothing so basically you are not
[29:03] almost contributing into the system but
[29:05] you are taking everything from the
[29:07] system if it's based on your actual
[29:10] State I mean like everybody will be
[29:12] motivated to go to the gym everybody
[29:15] will be motivated to take care of their
[29:16] body everybody will be motivated to do
[29:19] it because their payments are going to
[29:21] be lower there are incentives if you
[29:24] don't have those incentives I mean it
[29:27] cannot work so look I I can I got like
[29:30] nine different uh like a global health
[29:33] insurance companies that can uh that can
[29:36] offer you a pretty good deal it can be
[29:39] worldwide it can be specific for certain
[29:41] countries you pay a fair share based on
[29:44] your health and your age and and so on
[29:47] and you're definitely going to get it
[29:48] cheaper than paying it in uh in
[29:51] Austria absolutely I I 100% agree with
[29:55] that um will Bitcoin then uh kind of
[30:00] like when we have now full Bitcoin
[30:02] standard and we don't have a feat
[30:04] monetary standard when we look at that
[30:06] World um will that change will we change
[30:10] more in a in a service-based government
[30:12] or will those kind of governments even
[30:15] if if Bitcoin is worldwide accepted is
[30:17] kind of a world Reserve currency um will
[30:21] that always be that there are some
[30:23] states that that have control like China
[30:26] or Europe or something like that
[30:28] look I yeah it's a pretty good question
[30:30] it's it's hard to predict what's going
[30:32] to happen honestly uh because like I
[30:34] would say in the last couple of years
[30:35] who would have been predicted like
[30:38] what's what's happening these days right
[30:40] I think that uh my experience so far is
[30:44] that uh world is not like a homogeneous
[30:49] like they're they're not uh in a good
[30:52] cooperation every single like there are
[30:55] 196 States or territor across the globe
[30:59] and I'm telling you one thing never ever
[31:02] going to happen that everybody will
[31:04] agree with everybody else on the same
[31:07] thing so which is good and bad uh I'll
[31:10] give you an example the good thing is
[31:13] that those States cannot agree on Tiny
[31:16] things and not even talking about like a
[31:19] fin financial status or or what kind of
[31:23] currency will be using the country and
[31:25] so on the good thing is that there is St
[31:29] in a standard way there is a competition
[31:31] between countries so the benefit you can
[31:34] take from it is that if one country is
[31:38] like starting to restrict uh regulate uh
[31:43] like creating obstacles for you so you
[31:46] always find in the world probably some
[31:49] kind of option where you can move and
[31:52] there will be another country saying ah
[31:55] we will have a benefit
[31:58] out of it because we can see that some
[32:00] countries are restricting X so we are
[32:04] going to allow X because when we allow X
[32:08] we are going to have more people in our
[32:10] country we can attract people in our
[32:12] country we will have them those benefits
[32:15] so this is something that you can for a
[32:18] future like work with that I'm doing it
[32:20] quite a lot so so trying to find
[32:23] countries where are benefits for myself
[32:26] where I can see the value
[32:28] and always you find some countries
[32:30] popping up and for example what one
[32:33] country is restricting the other one is
[32:34] allowing it h on the other hand from the
[32:37] Bitcoin perspective this is the I don't
[32:41] know maybe downside in terms of I'm not
[32:44] that big believer that it's going to
[32:46] happen in a close future it's going to
[32:50] be like all the world's going to be
[32:53] working on a Bitcoin I see it as like a
[32:56] parallel l parallel uh kind of a payment
[33:00] rail where we don't need to have a
[33:03] permission to do that and especially if
[33:06] you're self- custody if you're having
[33:08] really your own private keys and you're
[33:11] going to be doing peer-to-peer trades
[33:13] within you and me then uh we don't need
[33:16] to ask anybody so in that manner we are
[33:19] always going to have our freedom to
[33:22] transact but saying that I believe that
[33:26] there still will be big uh like uh
[33:29] Behemoth uh countries like you said
[33:31] China and uh like total totalitarian
[33:36] regimes that will not allow to have a
[33:40] Bitcoin as a currency because they will
[33:42] not have any kind of control over that
[33:45] system so you know what we have now ETFs
[33:50] hey nice it's a investment like kind of
[33:52] like I would say for Wall Street it's
[33:54] kind of like a speculation right hey we
[33:56] can make some per on bitcoin I my guess
[34:00] is like a lot of them they don't even
[34:02] care about it they don't even know maybe
[34:04] what is a self- custody and if they know
[34:06] it they maybe heard it a little bit but
[34:09] there is like a kind of speculation on a
[34:11] small asset that can grow in a total
[34:13] total market market cap value but seeing
[34:17] it as a
[34:19] currency I would say more like a
[34:22] parallel currency for maybe Millions
[34:25] maybe hundreds of millions people maybe
[34:27] maybe billions people but I think like a
[34:30] lot of governments are going to have a
[34:31] problem with that if you watch or listen
[34:33] to my podcast on a regular basis I guess
[34:36] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[34:39] the most important step is to keep the
[34:42] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[34:44] wallet my personal recommendation for
[34:46] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[34:49] secure it's simple to set up it's also

[35:41] in Bitcoin self custody and how to be a
[35:44] secure sovereign individual in general
[35:47] and last but not least I have something
[35:50] completely new for you guys I partnered
[35:53] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[35:56] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[35:59] saw created by anyone look at that
[36:02] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[36:05] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[36:08] the perfect subtle elegant way to go out
[36:11] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[36:14] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[36:17] make sure to check out the link in the
[36:19] description for this amazing coin
[36:21] vilante time pieces those watches are
[36:24] amazing I love them so much it was
[36:26] really hard for me to pick the one that
[36:28] I want to have because there are a lot
[36:30] of great options I went with the new
[36:32] transparency Edition they're all limited
[36:36] so grab yours those will not be
[36:38] available for a long time but there will
[36:40] come new models and new amazing designs
[36:43] along the way I also
[36:45] um I think if it ever happens that
[36:48] Bitcoin is a global standard in its only
[36:51] Bitcoin like there's a difference
[36:53] between uh oh Bitcoin is kind of
[36:56] accepted everywhere the world it's it's
[36:58] it's to a certain extent also now like
[37:01] you can go in almost every country uh
[37:04] exchange your Bitcoin for either goods
[37:06] and services or for a local currency and
[37:08] then get goods and services so Bitcoin
[37:11] is accepted worldwide today uh but to a
[37:15] certain extent where it's there are so
[37:17] many great products and services where
[37:19] you can instantly pay with your Bitcoin
[37:22] uh we will get there uh I think not that
[37:24] far but to an extent where there's no
[37:26] other current curency that will take
[37:29] either very long or will never happen uh
[37:33] I I I hope to believe uh that it's that
[37:37] lad that it's actually happens but it's
[37:39] just takes a while uh but it's it's hard
[37:42] to hard to for see because like there's
[37:44] really bad currencies like the Turkish L
[37:47] for example and it still exists people
[37:49] still use it uh because there's a really
[37:52] hard Network effect around that but yeah
[37:54] it's a it's a currency that is complet
[37:56] like everyone inas that that's a really
[37:59] inflated currency we don't need that
[38:02] that Turkish L but they don't change to
[38:05] US dollars for the same reason they
[38:06] don't change to bitcoin so it's it's
[38:09] like there there would be so many better
[38:12] ways uh and and it will be it will be
[38:14] interesting how how it turns out and and
[38:17] uh it it will be really interesting how
[38:19] this transition goes if if we get to a
[38:22] Bitcoin only world uh and if we get
[38:24] there I have I have no clue about that
[38:26] but I'm I'm right wrting my thoughts
[38:28] down and I'm I'm trying to figure out
[38:30] where it goes and that's why I'm asking
[38:31] always my my guests about it I look I
[38:34] think one more uh one more take on that
[38:37] uh is that like you said if you're
[38:40] bitcoiner and I can tell from my side if
[38:44] you go to a country even though it's not
[38:47] Bitcoin exception everywhere you can
[38:49] always find peer-to-peer uh it's going
[38:52] to take you even though you're new in
[38:53] the country you don't know anybody here
[38:56] uh you can easily within like one day
[38:59] find somebody who's going to do a
[39:01] peer-to-peer with you and you can uh
[39:04] just do swap for their Fiat shitcoin
[39:08] okay so that's not an issue if you're a
[39:11] bitcoiner it's easy if you're like
[39:14] having self- custody and and knowing
[39:16] this stuff it's even easier because
[39:18] you're doing peer-to-peer maybe in your
[39:20] in your city right and you go for a
[39:22] Meetup and and so on so that's not that
[39:24] big issue for us for normal people it
[39:28] still can be because they don't know how
[39:30] to approach it and
[39:32] uh besides having it as a parallel kind
[39:36] of economy it's good for you as a
[39:39] bitcoiner that's also another take like
[39:41] I mean if you're go mainstream and
[39:43] Bitcoin is going to make happen and
[39:45] become a mainstream and it's going to
[39:47] obviously be regulations applied on
[39:51] every single wallet that you can have
[39:53] and it needs to be custodial and it
[39:55] needs to have a proof of keys from this
[39:57] address and if it's not there so you
[39:59] cannot interact with the old traditional
[40:02] system and so on what you can already
[40:04] see in Europe right so uh you don't want
[40:08] to have just one option in the Bitcoin
[40:10] you want to have a parallel economy
[40:12] where okay you can do whatever you want
[40:14] you have a self- custody that's the this
[40:16] is what we cannot lose this is something
[40:19] what gives you the freedom what's
[40:20] maintaining your freedom so your freedom
[40:23] these days are not ETFs your freedom is
[40:26] not a Bitcoin on uh big exchanges right
[40:29] your Bitcoin in custodia wallet is not
[40:32] your Bitcoin effectively so the only
[40:35] option how to be Sovereign how to have a
[40:38] freedom when you know [ __ ] hits the fan
[40:42] so is that you have Bitcoin under your
[40:45] own control you take a plane you Bard a
[40:48] plane with a small like that device and
[40:51] you go 10,000 miles across the globe you
[40:55] set up there and you keep going because
[40:59] that's cool so this is like what we I at
[41:02] least see it from that perspective this
[41:04] is what we need because like regulations
[41:06] going to be regul uh governing bodies
[41:08] going to be here but you need to
[41:11] maintain and preserve a freedom yeah
[41:14] very true and it's uh I never heard that
[41:18] take that it it's might be better than
[41:22] not too many that it's not only Bitcoin
[41:25] so it's not hardly regulated it's
[41:27] interesting take and and yeah I
[41:29] definitely feel like Europe is going in
[41:31] that direction and that's also one
[41:33] aspect not only taxes not only other
[41:36] things because taxes there are solutions
[41:39] but the other things is like uh how how
[41:42] is Europe going to develop and how how
[41:45] is Austria um reacting to those
[41:47] developments in Europe uh that is also
[41:50] something that is on my mind that's why
[41:52] I'm uh watching politics uh Too Close
[41:56] yeah because uh we always say like
[41:59] politics don't matter that's true for
[42:02] Bitcoin but it's not true for yourself
[42:04] like you you a physical body in in that
[42:07] country uh and and and they can uh
[42:10] restrict you uh and that's that's why
[42:13] it's I think as as an as an Bitcoin also
[42:17] important uh to watch politics and what
[42:19] they're doing in your own country uh
[42:22] with the regulations with the concepts
[42:24] they're doing uh so yeah Bitcoin
[42:27] obviously doesn't care about politics
[42:28] because Bitcoin is global as you said
[42:30] before like when there's one country
[42:32] that has high restrictions on bitcoin
[42:34] there will be another count that say
[42:35] like oh yeah please bitcoiners come to
[42:37] me because there are no restrictions
[42:38] here there are no taxes on bitcoin so
[42:40] this will always be a balance and there
[42:42] will not never be a global thing against
[42:45] Bitcoin um but for you personally uh you
[42:50] should watch uh what your country is
[42:52] doing to you uh and maybe there are
[42:54] better options I think that's that's
[42:56] that's one learning for for bitcoiners
[42:59] definitely because I feel like they are
[43:01] too like ah I don't care about politics
[43:02] I have Bitcoin yeah yeah you have
[43:04] Bitcoin but on the other hand you have
[43:06] to realize that you're effectively are
[43:08] slave all right so what what government
[43:11] is taking care of is that we need to
[43:14] have enough slaves that are from the
[43:17] beginning from the day they they are
[43:19] born are being developed to contribute
[43:24] into the economy pay taxes taxes taxes
[43:28] taxes taxes and then you die okay so
[43:30] you're effectively slaved the whole life
[43:33] and if especially like you said with the
[43:36] politics uh governments they don't care
[43:38] about their own citizens basically it's
[43:40] the politics and and you needs to be I
[43:44] believe selfish in that mode and not
[43:46] saying like a selfish as an individual
[43:48] maybe you will see it from the family
[43:50] perspective okay this is still like in
[43:52] comparison to to the whole society it's
[43:56] selfishness so your selfish unit is
[43:58] let's say family okay this is where you
[44:00] need to put like kind of I would say
[44:02] boundaries and this is like your level
[44:04] and say okay so what I need to protect
[44:08] is the family unit and the family unit
[44:11] needs to have a freedom and the family
[44:13] unit needs to live a life like how we
[44:15] want and if we don't like something okay
[44:18] we can move somewhere else where it's
[44:20] totally fine so you trying to preserve
[44:24] your freedom for a family unit and
[44:26] that's why also what you need besides
[44:28] that Bitcoin is giving you one lack of
[44:31] that freedom in a
[44:32] transaction so you need to have also
[44:35] like a Mobility uh Freedom that's that's
[44:37] another problem so this is what I think
[44:40] about it quite a lot is I'm not relying
[44:43] on a one document from one country it's
[44:46] like if that again [ __ ] hits the fan so
[44:49] you're locked and then done so you need
[44:52] to have like a multiple options backup
[44:55] options how you can preserve your
[44:58] Mobility across the globe so ideally you
[45:01] want more citizenships and uh not
[45:04] relying on just one citizenship you
[45:07] never know what going to happen ideally
[45:09] you want those citizenships like a lot
[45:11] of like a part not being in the same
[45:14] basket like a European Union it doesn't
[45:16] matter if it's going to be uh German one
[45:19] and and Austrian one or Czech one or
[45:22] Spanish one it's going to be the same
[45:24] you need like from totally different
[45:26] part of the world world or at least uh
[45:28] some kind of like uh residency permits
[45:31] in multiple countries and having those
[45:34] backup plans okay so if something goes
[45:36] down bad here I have the option to
[45:38] maintain Mobility for the family or for
[45:41] you it doesn't matter but I think like
[45:45] that selfish look from that family
[45:48] perspective is really important to be
[45:52] ready for what's coming in future and I
[45:55] don't know what's coming I'm just saying
[45:57] if something bad's coming you should be
[45:59] prepared for that because later it's
[46:03] yeah too late I think that's a great s
[46:06] segue into the next question that I have
[46:09] for you it's like um what and I think
[46:13] you uh think you um thought about that
[46:16] well already um what are some
[46:18] operational security Basics uh
[46:21] especially when you want to secure your
[46:23] digital self and uh your physical self
[46:27] uh that that you know that you're like
[46:28] everyone should know about those Basics
[46:31] okay so that uh okay so that obite
[46:34] depends okay what you trying to protect
[46:36] against okay that's that's the first
[46:38] definition you should be uh clear about
[46:41] like it's going to be a definitely
[46:43] totally uh it's going to be totally
[46:45] different approach uh when you're trying
[46:47] to when your when your adversary is uh
[46:52] three digigit agencies it's probably
[46:55] there's not going to be a pretty good
[46:57] kind of upsite to that uh because there
[46:59] are like really like unlimited amount of
[47:02] resources uh they can get but if if it's
[47:06] like okay you want to
[47:09] be secure then depends if it's digital
[47:12] one and if it's uh what What's happening
[47:15] on the on the physical side of things so
[47:18] physical side of things I would say it
[47:20] depends on the country where you're
[47:22] trying to blend in I like kind of like
[47:26] the rule of thumb that works pretty well
[47:30] and because we would don't want to sit
[47:32] here like for three hours just about
[47:33] like upsc uh approaches are try to be a
[47:38] gray man it's gray man you blend in okay
[47:42] you don't want to pop up somewhere like
[47:44] with something that doesn't belong there
[47:46] so if we go in Latin America okay I've
[47:49] been living in Brazil and in Brazil uh
[47:51] the opsac is totally different from uh
[47:55] let's say opsac in Chile or or Paraguay
[47:59] or Uruguay these countries are safe
[48:02] Brazil in some certain cities are I
[48:06] would say more dangerous or I've been in
[48:10] in uh Johannesburg Johannesburg South
[48:12] Africa also not a safe City so different
[48:16] approaches to that but when you're
[48:17] trying to blend in you look like the
[48:19] other people you wear similar clothes
[48:21] you don't uh flesh uh you know expensive
[48:23] watch and and uh kind of like a
[48:27] trying to attract your your identity to
[48:30] others so then you're kind of cool
[48:32] you're trying to do whatever uh body
[48:35] else is doing I don't know normally in
[48:37] Latin America let's say in Brazil often
[48:39] times happening that when you got a
[48:41] phone in your hand it's definitely
[48:43] tourist locals not using much phones
[48:45] like let's say in a in a Subway or in a
[48:48] public transport uh because it's
[48:50] dangerous so nobody's doing it some
[48:53] countries for example they got to like
[48:54] curfew after after Sunset nobody's uh
[48:58] you know living outside a house so if
[49:00] you're outside you're probably not local
[49:02] and so on so you need to do your job
[49:04] identify threats identify the lifestyle
[49:07] identify what the locals doing and uh
[49:10] you put it into a sheet you okay
[49:13] orientate yourself in that and you try
[49:15] to blend into that so then you're pretty
[49:18] fine this is like a rule of thumb gray
[49:20] man in digital identity yeah like there
[49:24] are so many things you can do but but uh
[49:27] definitely like uh if we talk about
[49:29] Bitcoin I mentioned it uh good Hardware
[49:32] wallet with a good uh uh additional
[49:38] layers of security so I would say if you
[49:42] really want to be secure uh kind of like
[49:44] a Shamir backup or or having a multi-c
[49:48] uh solution to your Bitcoins depending
[49:51] okay what what what is the worth of
[49:52] bitcoin if it makes sense to put it in
[49:54] place or some sort of part passphrases
[49:57] that are creating another plausible
[49:59] deniable account and so on so this is
[50:03] like a Bitcoin side of things definitely
[50:05] don't rely on a custodial Solutions
[50:07] because you never know what's going to
[50:09] happen uh and apart from that I would
[50:13] say that's a good rabbit hole for
[50:15] everybody to start just studying okay
[50:17] how I can secure my digital uh identity
[50:22] so password managers okay two two otps
[50:26] like uh second layer Pro uh changing
[50:28] codes uh uh then uh you know like Harden
[50:33] browers maybe using like a Linux based
[50:36] system on a phone I would say a graphine
[50:39] OS with uh with everything hardened and
[50:42] so on so then then it's like another
[50:45] kind of like a rabbit hole where to dig
[50:47] in and how to be more secure and not a
[50:51] threat and trying to escape from all
[50:54] those fingerprinting and cookies and and
[50:58] identifying your devices and preserve a
[51:02] little bit more privacy uh it's not
[51:05] going to be 100% obviously but it's a
[51:07] pretty good step uh to have a better
[51:09] privacy in that sense and yeah from the
[51:12] security perspective use passwort
[51:13] managers and
[51:15] tops at least do do you have a an
[51:19] Emergency plan where you're like oh when
[51:21] when my country turns into [ __ ] I have
[51:23] an emergency pack and then I just leave
[51:25] or something like that I mean double
[51:27] residency something like that you
[51:28] already mentioned yeah like uh I think
[51:31] everybody should have that honestly so
[51:34] yeah okay I I okay I live in a backpack
[51:37] uh the whole life so I got a pretty good
[51:39] one uh I also got a article about
[51:42] backpack what I've selected and why I'm
[51:43] using it and what I have in my EDC okay
[51:46] so I got every carry and what I'm
[51:48] carrying in that and and it's kind of
[51:50] like a I would say crossover between
[51:52] emergency back and like a daily driver
[51:55] because sometimes [ __ ] Happ happens
[51:56] during the day so uh you know it can be
[52:00] something pretty stupid uh I mean I
[52:03] don't know you can be uh like uh in a
[52:06] car crash okay or somebody had a car
[52:09] crash for example so you need to stop
[52:11] okay so I got a like a emergency shears
[52:14] that can cut through clothes I can I got
[52:16] a gloves because something's going to
[52:18] probably sharp so I can just break the
[52:20] window uh uh I got a blanket like I that
[52:24] blanket is like size of 5 cm or so when
[52:27] you when you roll it together and it's a
[52:29] it's aluminium blanket so it's also
[52:31] Thermo blanket and so on so you I got
[52:33] Canada crossover but besides of that I
[52:35] got an emergency backpack the big one
[52:38] that I can leave my premises within like
[52:42] 30 yeah 30 40
[52:45] seconds oh that's that's an interesting
[52:48] uh interesting inside really cool I
[52:50] think the those things are really uh
[52:53] important uh to at least think about the
[52:56] the the situations like what what are
[52:58] what are you trying to protect from what
[53:00] are you trying to accomplish and then
[53:02] okay how can I solve that because like
[53:04] security is never 100% but you can do uh
[53:07] as as much as possible uh to prevent bad
[53:11] things from from happening there it's
[53:15] really really cool do you have um do you
[53:17] have an unexpected lesson or some
[53:20] unconventional tool for for OBC that you
[53:23] you found uh helpful that you kind of
[53:26] can share or is something that that is
[53:28] uh that is unconventional or is an
[53:31] unexpected that you that you had to
[53:32] enhance your freedom or or you have some
[53:35] or also from moving maybe to Latin
[53:37] America H there are there are so many
[53:40] things man uh but uh let me let let let
[53:43] me think about it a little bit what
[53:45] might be unconventional what I'm doing
[53:47] okay uh it's more about security uh so I
[53:51] don't think you are going to need it
[53:53] that much probably in Austria but uh I
[53:56] always we a small dagger it's a like
[53:59] really tiny dagger that is on my neck so
[54:03] this is like Last Resort of like you
[54:06] know you're being mocked or whatever so
[54:10] if you're being mocked so still it's
[54:12] much better okay uh First Step what what
[54:15] I'm trying to do always is when you're
[54:17] being mucked have like uh whatever like
[54:21] $50 in your pocket okay not in your
[54:25] wallet but in your pocket market so in
[54:28] many countries it's a substantial amount
[54:31] and and when you're being marked so you
[54:33] just take out those $50 and you know
[54:36] it's uh always a game of probability so
[54:39] even those eackers are playing against
[54:42] the time so when you're being Mark so
[54:45] when you have hey here's a $50 so
[54:47] normally they jump on a motorbike and
[54:49] they just leave so it's much safer
[54:52] honestly to deal this this way than
[54:55] trying to Pro protect and maybe in your
[54:58] backpack maybe on your body something
[55:00] else is something more valuable than
[55:03] those 50 bucks so this is like how to a
[55:07] like trying to get out of the like
[55:10] shitty situation
[55:11] easily but uh then you can like okay hey
[55:15] here more stuff if something goes wrong
[55:18] and if it's really go wrong and you have
[55:20] to you have no other options so I got a
[55:22] dagger because that's a really small
[55:24] dagger that can do a lot of damage and
[55:27] if you don't have any other option so
[55:29] better to have something than nothing so
[55:31] yeah using that and uh another thing is
[55:34] I got a belt and that belt is like
[55:36] double layer so you can stuff your Fiat
[55:39] cash in that double layer belt and uh so
[55:44] again you don't need it probably in
[55:46] Austria but uh in Latin America it's
[55:48] pretty good to have especially in some
[55:50] countries they are not that safe and uh
[55:53] nobody's normally stealing your belt I
[55:56] mean like they may might steal your
[55:58] shoes but I never heard that okay you're
[56:01] playing against some probability but
[56:03] normally nobody stealing
[56:05] belts G give me your belt never heard
[56:10] that that's a that's a great learning
[56:12] yeah thank you um before we come to the
[56:14] end routine of the podcast I always have
[56:17] one question that every one of my guest
[56:19] gets and the question for you is what
[56:22] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin
[56:25] opsac and all things that you already
[56:27] talked about
[56:29] H wow this is a tough one I don't know
[56:32] like yeah uh about Latin America about
[56:35] those uh like I'm I'm pretty Dig Down uh
[56:41] a lot of time in those optionality in
[56:45] Mobility so I'm trying to
[56:47] seek for where to have another
[56:51] identities like which countries where it
[56:54] makes sense where are low requirement
[56:56] ments on people to fulfill those
[56:59] requirements because this is what you
[57:00] want you don't want to have a lot of
[57:01] requirements as as as in another country
[57:05] or where it's making a like a good
[57:07] benefit for you as a okay this is it
[57:10] beneficial to be in that country as a
[57:12] resident or as a citizen okay what it
[57:15] brings me what it gives me and on the
[57:17] other hand what it uh requires from me
[57:21] that government let's say or that
[57:22] country so trying to find a routes uh in
[57:26] that manner and combine it with uh yeah
[57:29] other services across globe with uh to
[57:32] have more freedom so obviously if you
[57:35] can live just from Bitcoin it's from the
[57:38] payment perspective it's the best way
[57:40] you can do and just get rid of the Fiat
[57:42] standard payment rails some people
[57:45] cannot do that and for example for them
[57:47] they need to stick with the standard
[57:49] Fiat system and in that case searching
[57:53] for payment processors or Banks that are
[57:58] friendlier compared to let's say
[58:00] European ones that are pretty pain big
[58:03] pain in the ass and using in another
[58:07] jurisdictions banks that allowing let's
[58:09] say uh citizens from not just European
[58:12] Union but from from other countries to
[58:15] open a bank account or or some kind of
[58:18] crossover from crypto into the Fiat
[58:21] through like a fintech that is uh having
[58:24] easier policies because of uh not being
[58:28] regulated let's say in the European
[58:30] Union because they don't offer services
[58:32] in European Union so kind of like I
[58:35] would say it's like multiple steps in uh
[58:39] okay where is your Mobility do you have
[58:41] enough Mobility okay how you make
[58:43] handling payments like exchanging values
[58:46] with the other ones okay how you going
[58:48] to run the business uh globally or even
[58:51] in your country what is the best benefit
[58:54] to run the business uh from a tax
[58:57] perspective uh also like administrative
[59:00] perspective that you don't have to deal
[59:02] with so much
[59:03] bureaucracy uh okay what is your health
[59:06] insurance like you mentioned right uh
[59:09] okay what might be the best cell phone
[59:11] operator to use globally even though you
[59:14] might use it in Europe but there are
[59:16] definitely better cell phone operators
[59:18] outside Europe for Europe then they're
[59:20] from Europe for Europe so this is also
[59:24] also possible to Outsource from another
[59:26] jurisdiction and so on so you're trying
[59:29] to put like a puzzles together and it
[59:32] should create the whole picture right so
[59:36] and definitely Bitcoin is one big part
[59:39] out of it yeah the decentralizing your
[59:43] finances is I think the the first and
[59:46] most uh fundamental step towards it
[59:50] taking your the ability to take your
[59:52] financial energy over country borders is
[59:55] just amazing and and nobody can can stop
[59:57] you from that they they can try to tax
[59:59] you outside of their jurisdiction but
[60:02] the the physical moving is is is amazing
[60:06] it's like go go to a count go to any
[60:08] border H fly try to fly with like a Kil
[60:12] gold or or like suitcase with a cash a
[60:14] suitcase of cash yeah like they they
[60:17] will stop you they will assume that that
[60:20] cash is not belonging to you that they
[60:21] will assume that you did something
[60:23] illegal with it exactly uh so it's it's
[60:26] uh it's fascinating to see so like
[60:28] Bitcoin uh in worst case scenario you
[60:31] can even save it in your head uh even
[60:33] though I never recommend that but you
[60:35] can you can do that go over borders and
[60:37] and put it on a in a self custom
[60:40] solution a good one Bitcoin has a lot of
[60:42] options and it's it's great for freedom
[60:45] and and and for your own Prosperity I I
[60:48] like it a lot from that perspective
[60:50] honestly I feel safer like when you are
[60:52] enough time in Bitcoin and and you're
[60:56] I would say maybe you studied enough
[60:59] okay and you I'm not saying enough but
[61:01] let's say at least a certain amount of
[61:04] hundreds of hours and you're after years
[61:07] getting more and more comfortable with
[61:09] Bitcoin uh and you think about like a
[61:12] future what can really go wrong then
[61:15] having Bitcoin you feel definitely safer
[61:19] than having Fiat money in the bank
[61:21] honestly like in my perspective like you
[61:25] can have a sound sleep sleep because
[61:27] okay the protocol itself can have a buck
[61:30] the protocol itself can have some issues
[61:33] we know that because it's still a code
[61:35] that is running but on the other hand
[61:38] this is still a better uh kind of like a
[61:42] risk reward ratio than to just relying
[61:46] on a standard Fiat over regulated Banks
[61:49] where your Fiat money that is not even
[61:53] yours are sitting and you need to ask
[61:56] for permission to use them and or to
[61:58] withdraw them and when you're
[62:00] withdrawing them they are asking you why
[62:02] you need to withdraw it and maybe they
[62:05] will do something wrong that you bought
[62:07] a bottle of whiskey in a wrong time and
[62:11] they say okay we are not going to give
[62:12] you that cash because you did something
[62:14] you shouldn't have done before so from
[62:17] their perspective asking for permission
[62:19] to use your own money uh versus having
[62:23] it totally under control that giv me a
[62:26] better sleep and it's still better risk
[62:29] rward ratio and I think everybody will
[62:32] get into that point when you're in a
[62:33] time in big I truly think so too um I
[62:37] love it a lot and we already uh
[62:39] unfortunately at the end of the podcast
[62:40] and it was always already a pleasure
[62:43] talking with you uh last thing we have
[62:45] the endro tee of the podcast where the
[62:47] previous guest is asking a question for
[62:49] the next guest without knowing who the
[62:50] next guest actually is and your question
[62:53] is how do you see Bitcoin fit in in
[62:56] human history say it again how do you
[62:59] see Bitcoin fit in human history oh how
[63:03] do see Bitcoin fit in human history yeah
[63:05] wow that that is one of the most uh
[63:09] incredible
[63:11] inventions like we've we've had I mean
[63:15] like uh it's totally mind-blowing uh I
[63:19] think like uh in a future that's going
[63:22] to be in a history books uh and I mean
[63:26] it's not about market cap uh I don't
[63:29] honestly you need certain market cap to
[63:31] be uh using Enough by people but it's
[63:34] not about about that if it's a 1 billion
[63:37] two billion three billion whatever
[63:39] number it's about that freedom this is
[63:41] what struck me at first when I came into
[63:43] the Bitcoin it's still here it never
[63:46] changed so this is going to be in
[63:48] history books because of the first
[63:51] payment method that I don't need to have
[63:53] a permission that to transfer you value
[63:59] and uh I can do it even if you like it
