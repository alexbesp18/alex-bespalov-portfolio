[00:00] stocks are a pretty good inflation hedge
[00:01] it appears but yeah you're not really
[00:03] getting ahead the the whole financial
[00:05] Independence retire early or or the
[00:07] whole fire movement was based on this
[00:09] kind of old model this what we now know
[00:11] is like a Fiat model Bitcoin has
[00:13] completely shifted that Paradigm but I'm
[00:15] most interested in is separation of
[00:16] money from State saving for your future
[00:18] should be gratifying I'm always a really
[00:20] big believer in paying yourself actually
[00:22] first if I adop Bitcoin housing is
[00:24] getting affordable if everybody adopts
[00:26] Bitcoin housing is getting affordable
[00:27] for
[00:28] everybody what it does it mean for you
[00:31] to be completely financially
[00:34] independent yeah um this was kind of a
[00:37] big thing in America uh there's this
[00:41] movement called the fire movement which
[00:44] stands for financial Independence retire
[00:47] early and so what that basically means
[00:51] is you know that you can have passive
[00:53] income and how that was usually done is
[00:57] either through a business real estate a
[01:00] certain amount of rentals or index funds
[01:04] and so the the whole financial
[01:05] Independence retire early or or the
[01:07] whole fire movement was based
[01:09] on on this kind of old model this what
[01:12] we now know as like a Fiat model or as a
[01:15] bitcoiner I know that that's what that's
[01:17] what it is basically it's just this
[01:19] you're depending
[01:20] on monetary debasement and you're
[01:24] depending on the stocks going up over
[01:25] time at 8% a year and you're you're
[01:28] depending on a 4% safe with rate and if
[01:31] you can basically get we'll just say $2
[01:33] million in stocks then you can live off
[01:36] of 4% of that which is 800 sorry 880,000
[01:40] a year and so as long as you can fund
[01:44] those expenses inuti and your stocks
[01:47] keep going up 8% a year which is really
[01:49] just the flate of monetary it's just the
[01:51] rate of monetary debasement right so so
[01:54] that's kind of what it started as for me
[01:57] um but Bitcoin has completely shifted
[01:59] that Paradigm where I don't know if it
[02:02] even makes sense to be financially you
[02:05] know I don't even know how well Bitcoin
[02:07] works with it other other than the money
[02:11] just maintains its value ideally right
[02:14] so it's it's kind of hard to to to
[02:16] imagine and explain on a Bitcoin
[02:18] standard
[02:20] but uh one way to think about it is
[02:24] you'll hear Financial experts say that
[02:26] you should save 10 or 20% of your income
[02:28] right
[02:30] uh if you save 10% of your income and
[02:33] live off 90% it's going to take you n
[02:36] years to save up one year of money so if
[02:40] you save 20% of your income and live off
[02:42] 80 it's going to take you four years if
[02:44] you save 30% of your income it's going
[02:46] to take you about uh two years to save
[02:49] up your your income well two and a half
[02:52] roughly
[02:53] but anyway it's it's it's really a heavy
[02:56] focus on savings rate but with Bitcoin I
[02:59] think it's just different because in
[03:01] theory your money will maintain its
[03:03] purchasing power over time versus you're
[03:06] just buying stocks that go up and pay
[03:09] dividends and appreciate faster than you
[03:12] spend if that makes sense so there
[03:15] there's kind of there's two ways of
[03:16] looking at there's the Bitcoin side and
[03:18] there's the the stocks and real estate
[03:21] side and then there's this beautiful
[03:23] thing that we have right now with
[03:24] Bitcoin that we are so early so we don't
[03:28] only have the thing that Bitcoin just
[03:30] appreciates with overtime or does not
[03:33] depreciate overtime because it's a good
[03:36] store of value but also gets adopted so
[03:38] a lot of more people come into the game
[03:40] we now at like three eight % adoption
[03:44] depending on what number you are looking
[03:46] at uh but we are coming uh when Bitcoin
[03:49] actually comes This Global Reserve
[03:50] currency This Global Reserve estet that
[03:52] everybody uses as money as as most of us
[03:56] probably imagine that it will be then we
[03:59] go from those small adoption rates to
[04:02] like 50 60 80 70 maybe 100% adoption
[04:05] rate so this is where like a huge upside
[04:08] potential actually is so it's like a
[04:10] weird in savings and investment pair
[04:13] where Bitcoin is the savings thing but
[04:15] also an investment side of things
[04:18] because uh it has such a huge amount of
[04:21] investment is a it's it's a weird thing
[04:23] to be in because it goes up so quickly
[04:27] but we are saying oh it's just a savings
[04:28] technology how do you look at
[04:32] it yeah um that's the thing is is from
[04:38] 2009 to 2021 I was completely all about
[04:43] stocks and even though I was reading
[04:46] about stocks at the time all I did
[04:48] really was buy index funds like the S&P
[04:50] 500 and
[04:52] so when I started learning about Bitcoin
[04:56] I first got into it in 2017 and
[05:00] my my uh dad and my sister were were
[05:02] interested in it and they were telling
[05:03] me about it I read about Warren Buffett
[05:05] I was like well he doesn't like it I
[05:07] like Warren Buffett so I I don't like
[05:09] Bitcoin either I'm just going to side
[05:10] with Warren Buffett eventually I got
[05:12] some fomo and I I ended up getting some
[05:16] ethereum mostly I thought I missed the
[05:18] vote on bitcoin so I I went with
[05:20] ethereum I even mined it for probably
[05:23] six months and um and you know I quickly
[05:27] like I quadrupled the money I put in in
[05:29] December of 2017 I went from 2,000 to
[05:32] 8,000 and then 6 months after this is
[05:36] the bottom of
[05:37] 2018 everything had taken a a big dive
[05:41] my $2,000 I originally put in was now
[05:43] $500 and I just sat on it and then it
[05:47] kind of came back in two uh
[05:50] 2021 and at that point I was like maybe
[05:52] there's something here so I ended up
[05:55] buying a course and learning about
[05:57] Bitcoin and it took me about 6 months to
[05:59] to really feel comfortable and to get it
[06:02] but I I ended up eventually selling my
[06:04] ethereum for Bitcoin I I even borrowed
[06:06] against my house for Bitcoin it it just
[06:08] clicked for me so it's it's a little bit
[06:10] tough you know when we talk about being
[06:12] financially independent because really
[06:14] Bitcoin it's still in the 60s 60,000 US
[06:18] dollar roughly or 63,000 today and
[06:22] that's not far from when I got into it
[06:24] in
[06:25] 2021 uh four what three years ago 3
[06:29] years ago now so um I'm hoping that the
[06:33] number continues to go up like you said
[06:34] with the we with the adoption to me it's
[06:37] it's an asymmetric bet you know because
[06:40] we are
[06:41] early um but yeah hopefully as the
[06:44] adoption goes up and I think as we see
[06:47] the money printers turn back on I think
[06:49] we will see those those numbers continue
[06:51] to go up but uh anyway it it definitely
[06:54] looks different on a on a Bitcoin
[06:57] standard on a hard money standard I
[06:59] think uh as far as being financially
[07:01] independent it's it's really if you
[07:03] imagine living on a gold standard uh
[07:07] we'll just say 200 years ago or
[07:08] something
[07:10] and yeah it is as simple as if you want
[07:12] to if you're going to work from age 20
[07:17] to 60 for 40 years and you're going to
[07:20] live to be 90 and so you're going to
[07:23] retire from 60 to 90 then yeah you you
[07:26] essentially need to save a certain
[07:27] amount of money for those 30 years but
[07:30] prices shouldn't go up necessarily
[07:33] prices might even go down as things
[07:36] improve as technology improves So in
[07:39] theory over your working career you you
[07:42] might be fine saving you know 10 15% of
[07:45] your money um but I do think Bitcoin
[07:47] makes you more frugal over time so
[07:50] anyway I know I'm kind of going off on a
[07:52] rant there but let me know what you want
[07:55] to touch on with that yeah it definitely
[07:57] makes me more frugal and I want to get
[07:59] into
[07:59] uh Financial frugality also a little bit
[08:02] later um but before uh we go there I
[08:05] would love to dive into what you said
[08:08] where you got ethereum then you also got
[08:11] Bitcoin and then you switched actually
[08:12] to bitcoin only as I understood it and
[08:15] you even like borrowed against your
[08:17] house um what made you do that like what
[08:20] what was was there something that
[08:23] clicked for you that like oh Bitcoin
[08:25] actually has value from and I can relate
[08:27] to that a lot because I was also War
[08:30] buffer child and was learning a lot
[08:33] about him and how to invest in stocks
[08:35] and stuff like that and how to pick
[08:36] stocks and I did a lot of stocks picking
[08:38] even uh before I get got onto Bitcoin
[08:41] but what made it click for you to be
[08:44] then um primarily focused on
[08:48] bitcoin um what what made sense to me
[08:51] over time with Bitcoin is understanding
[08:54] meaf models and just the value of a
[08:57] network and I know Facebook is kind of
[08:59] an example their stock
[09:01] price uh tends to kind of mirror it's a
[09:05] metf model it's it's a the size of the
[09:08] network makes the company more valuable
[09:11] that the amount of users they have
[09:12] directly influences the amount of uh
[09:15] value the stock has had over time so so
[09:19] you can you can see this in multiple
[09:21] different areas I don't have any great
[09:23] examples off off hand but metf models
[09:26] made sense to me and bit Bitcoin being a
[09:28] network
[09:29] it made sense to me that the value
[09:31] should increase over time just off of
[09:33] that but
[09:35] uh what what made a lot of sense to me
[09:38] is that it's a feature that Satoshi is
[09:40] not around that the founder of Bitcoin
[09:42] is not around that it's a asset without
[09:44] an
[09:45] issuer it's truly decentralized
[09:47] everything every other cryptocurrency is
[09:50] is trading that decentralization for
[09:53] Speed and some other stuff um that may
[09:55] or may not be useful but uh really what
[09:58] I'm most in is separation of money from
[10:01] State and and just savings technology so
[10:04] to me that's kind of what Bitcoin is
[10:08] um yeah it's it's it's kind of hard to
[10:11] explain to a new person uh I feel like
[10:13] there's so many things that you have to
[10:16] kind of set the record straight on that
[10:18] inflation is bad that inflation is theft
[10:21] you know because we're told and and most
[10:23] people kind of have this idea that a
[10:25] little inflation is good because it
[10:27] encourage you it encourages is the
[10:29] growth of the economy because you want
[10:31] to spend before your money goes down in
[10:32] value two even just two or 3% so you
[10:35] might as well spend today but Bitcoin
[10:37] kind of flips that and says you know you
[10:41] should save your money because in the
[10:43] future it's going to be cheaper so I I
[10:45] like that um I'm not like an
[10:48] environmentalist uh climate change type
[10:51] of guy but but I
[10:52] do some of that appeals to me in the
[10:56] fact of I I hate waste I hate wasting
[11:00] stuff I hate throwing away something
[11:01] that I could fix or that I could you
[11:05] know basically find another purpose for
[11:08] so like I'll see I'll see people leave
[11:11] stuff on the curb on garbage day that
[11:13] still has life in it and I'll go pick it
[11:15] up and I'll I'll I'll use it until it's
[11:17] truly used up or I'll I'll fix it up so
[11:20] that it can be used for a long time you
[11:22] know but I I really uh Bitcoin has kind
[11:25] of made me more frugal I've already had
[11:26] that tendency in my life but yeah I just
[11:28] hate
[11:29] waste um but yeah uh sorry that's a
[11:33] random thing there but bar oh go ahead
[11:37] go ahead no I just want to quickly jump
[11:40] in and say like uh Bitcoin and sound
[11:43] money in general like hard money versus
[11:45] soft money as we have with the fat
[11:47] standard it incentivizes to be more um
[11:52] careful with our environment careful
[11:54] with our nature also so Bitcoin when it
[11:57] actually uh presses sound money onto the
[12:00] world uh with that the nature and the
[12:03] environment uh and all those
[12:06] environmental activists will actually
[12:09] benefit from Bitcoin because it brings
[12:11] that um care for things back and feared
[12:16] because money is so cheap and it
[12:18] incentivizes a high time preference and
[12:20] uh High consumerism uh actually is
[12:23] against uh the environmental list so
[12:26] this is kind of like my my VI isn't I
[12:28] just want like quickly add to this but
[12:30] go ahead no I mean it's true and and it
[12:33] something this is just a random thing
[12:36] but it blows my mind that it's worth it
[12:39] to go dig up oil and get it out of the
[12:41] ground and ship it around the world and
[12:44] process it and turn it into a plastic
[12:45] cup that you use once and throw in the
[12:48] trash you know it blows my mind that
[12:50] that is economically profitable and
[12:54] feasible but it is uh because we have
[12:57] low time preference or or our High Time
[12:59] preference you know we're we're all
[13:00] about consumerism so yes infinite money
[13:03] and
[13:05] consumerism does go against the
[13:07] environment um people will say that
[13:09] Bitcoin wastes energy but we waste a lot
[13:11] of energy with
[13:12] these these High Time preference
[13:15] activities and not being willing to put
[13:17] in the work to you know even just do
[13:19] dishes and stuff but uh yeah if it's if
[13:23] it becomes if stuff like that becomes
[13:26] disincentivized uh over time then you
[13:28] know I think Bitcoin can disincentivize
[13:29] a lot of this consumerism stuff and just
[13:32] the throwaway culture so
[13:35] anyway you you also wanted to say
[13:37] something with borrowing against the
[13:39] house at where I cut you off oh yeah uh
[13:43] you know you asked about that and I
[13:45] would not recommend someone do that but
[13:48] when it made sense to me it it it just
[13:51] clicked and I kind of felt this sense of
[13:53] urgency that I was behind and I will say
[13:56] this at the time Plan B was this big
[13:58] thing on Twitter in
[14:01] 2021 and basically I remember in 2021 we
[14:05] were we were expecting Bitcoin to be
[14:06] like in the 80,000 range in November of
[14:09] 2021 and then like eventually into the
[14:12] the six figures and of course we never
[14:14] got there uh FTX Voyager Celsius all
[14:18] that happened and uh I narrowly escaped
[14:22] uh those brokage is going down uh by
[14:24] getting into self- custody but but yeah
[14:27] I'm not really sure
[14:29] why the price didn't do what we thought
[14:30] it was I think a lot of it had to do
[14:32] with paper Bitcoin uh basically people
[14:34] were buying obviously on FTX Bitcoin
[14:37] that was not there and different
[14:39] exchanges like that
[14:41] um but yeah I uh I basically felt like I
[14:46] was about to miss the bus and that
[14:47] Bitcoin could go parabolic and so we we
[14:50] did borrow against the house and then we
[14:52] lost like 70% of it we almost lost it
[14:54] all on Celsius but I I self- custody the
[14:57] money and uh
[14:59] you know I got a hardware wallet took it
[15:01] off exchange and I was safe and then it
[15:04] came back and obviously we're we're in
[15:05] the green again not by a lot but I've
[15:08] dollar cost average the whole time but
[15:10] yeah I just had conviction the other
[15:12] thing is if is if we were a single inome
[15:14] household I would not have borrowed
[15:16] against my house but we are a dual
[15:18] income household you know we're we're
[15:21] very we're very frugal as I said we live
[15:23] on about 50% of our income and then we
[15:25] save and invest the other 50% and so if
[15:28] I was not in that position I would not
[15:31] recommend borrowing against my house but
[15:32] I I felt like it was a calculated risk
[15:35] we could live off of one income if we
[15:37] had to and we're just uh paying off the
[15:40] debt with the other income if that makes
[15:42] sense were you always a Frugal or is
[15:45] this something that developed over time
[15:48] it's it's always I've always been that
[15:49] way um and kind of just been Thrifty um
[15:54] I've always driven old vehicles uh much
[15:56] older than a lot of people still
[16:00] um but yeah I just uh it's just the way
[16:04] that my mind works that makes sense um
[16:07] part of it
[16:08] is uh I'll share this it's it might be a
[16:12] little bit strange but um there's a
[16:14] Pioneer
[16:16] saying I don't know if I'm going to get
[16:17] it right but it's it's like make it do
[16:20] do
[16:22] without you might have to edit
[16:25] this but it's it's something that I I
[16:27] heard that has has stuck with me uh
[16:31] forever and it's it's let's see it says
[16:34] use it up wear it out make it do or do
[16:38] without and that's something I heard as
[16:40] a as a young child and it stuck with me
[16:44] you know throughout throughout the
[16:47] years that's amazing I led it I loved it
[16:50] a lot I don't even like I heard it a
[16:52] feel like before somehow uh but I never
[16:56] connected with that uh it's it's really
[16:58] beautiful I love it um and a lot of I
[17:02] feel like it comes from the fat world uh
[17:05] but I also of ask myself maybe it is
[17:08] because it's human nature to spend money
[17:11] like you have something and you want to
[17:13] kind of spend it now uh and you like you
[17:17] only live once what if you die next year
[17:20] and stuff like that does it really
[17:22] matter to to save up a lot of money like
[17:25] um is there a case to be made like
[17:28] outside of being financially independent
[17:31] in the future uh that you should be
[17:34] financially Frugal is is there like
[17:36] something that even gives you I mean you
[17:39] when you always were like that maybe
[17:41] it's it's hard for you to to talk about
[17:43] that but is there something that even
[17:45] gives you something now being Frugal uh
[17:50] and even like is something good about
[17:53] being minimalistic or Frugal fralis uh
[17:55] even
[17:56] now yeah that that's a tough one when um
[17:59] even even my dad when he got me
[18:01] interested in stocks and he you know I
[18:04] got so obsessed with stocks and
[18:06] investing and I've always saved
[18:08] basically 50% of my income um since
[18:12] college and even in college I worked and
[18:14] and I was able to save a lot of money um
[18:17] I had some high-paying sales jobs in
[18:19] college uh doing summer sales door too
[18:22] and uh my dad would always say make sure
[18:25] you have fun now and I you know I didn't
[18:27] really
[18:30] do a good job following that I I really
[18:32] delayed gratification for years for for
[18:35] example I used to race dirt bikes and I
[18:38] loved that as a teenager um I gave up
[18:41] dirt bikes for college I mean in college
[18:44] I could have rode I had the money to
[18:46] ride um but I chose not to because it
[18:48] was expensive parts are expensive dirt
[18:50] bikes are expensive the maintenance of
[18:52] them and and the gear and everything and
[18:55] uh even though I I've always had enough
[18:58] money to write dirt bikes I I chose to
[19:00] give up my favorite hobby and I I kind
[19:03] of I still watch the pros I read you
[19:05] know I read about the pros and I I
[19:07] follow the series The Professional
[19:09] Series closely but um I'm actually just
[19:12] barely getting back into it after
[19:15] basically 12 or 13 years off of dirt
[19:18] bikes and uh it's it's a little bit
[19:21] tough actually I'm I'm spending thousand
[19:24] of dollars on motorcycles and getting
[19:26] gear again and getting my my kids into
[19:29] it um and part of it the why I want to
[19:32] now is is I have built that base because
[19:34] I took a decade of saving half my income
[19:37] and investing that money into stocks
[19:39] Bitcoin and real estate and so i' I've
[19:42] got a really good base compared to most
[19:44] people actually any age group in America
[19:47] I'm doing quite well on a comparative
[19:49] basis but um but yeah it's because I I
[19:53] sacrificed it for a decade or more and
[19:56] uh part of me wishes that I had done
[20:00] that stuff still and that I had more fun
[20:01] because it's hard getting back into it a
[20:03] little bit older but anyway that's uh
[20:06] not everyone's wired that way but I'm
[20:09] definitely the type that is willing and
[20:11] able to delay gratification but I'm I'm
[20:14] actually forcing myself to spend money
[20:15] now a little bit
[20:17] more and I feel like it's also like an
[20:20] age thing uh and I feel like when you're
[20:23] are young there is the time where you
[20:25] should actually discipline yourself as
[20:27] much as you can
[20:29] uh to be more like there's a lot of
[20:33] studies on that like there's scientific
[20:35] proof on that uh people that especially
[20:38] when they have like kids or even young
[20:40] people uh that are able to delay the
[20:44] gratification uh they are way more
[20:46] successful in later in life because they
[20:49] are willing to dive into mud a little
[20:52] bit now to have something bigger
[20:55] tomorrow like if this makes sense and
[20:57] this is like not even not even if you
[20:59] are conservative and you just like have
[21:02] a normal job and you like want to have
[21:05] like 20% or 50% savings rate uh but even
[21:09] like if you want to build a business
[21:11] sometimes you have to like
[21:13] really uh have a hard time uh growing
[21:16] something and building something out and
[21:19] then uh maybe you can see the the the
[21:23] rewards of that in like five 10 years
[21:25] and maybe you'll never see it because it
[21:27] does not work out but that delayed
[21:30] gratification allows you to accept the
[21:33] lower pay uh to accept like uh second
[21:37] job next to your business and something
[21:38] like that so there's a lot to um delayed
[21:42] gratification even Beyond just being
[21:45] Frugal and and saving money I feel like
[21:48] um is it something you think people can
[21:50] learn it's like being Frugal something
[21:53] that you you could imagine
[21:55] teaching yeah um I mean and kind of what
[21:58] you're talking about maybe you maybe
[21:59] you're familiar with this it's it's
[22:01] something called the marshmallow test
[22:03] it's a test that they did on kids um
[22:05] where they basically set a kid in a room
[22:08] and they don't know they're being filmed
[22:11] but they you put a marshmallow on a
[22:13] plate and say if you can wait 15
[22:15] minutes then I'll give you another
[22:17] marshmallow or you can just eat the one
[22:20] right in front of you now and the kids
[22:22] that waited and got two marshmallows at
[22:25] the end of 15 minutes those are the
[22:27] those kids actually went on to be a lot
[22:29] more successful uh they had less
[22:31] problems with like addictions as they
[22:33] grew up you know these these are like
[22:34] five or six year olds right that they're
[22:36] testing and and researching but uh you
[22:41] know there there was other factors of
[22:42] that test as well but um I've actually
[22:45] done that to my own kids and we we'll
[22:47] have them do the marshmallow test and
[22:49] see if they can last 15 minutes alone
[22:51] with the marshmallow so they can get
[22:53] that second one um but but yeah I'm
[22:55] trying to teach my kids that and the
[22:57] other thing is is that about delayed
[23:00] gratification is saving for your future
[23:03] should be
[23:04] gratifying and for some reason people
[23:07] don't think it is but I love when I get
[23:10] paid and I shave off half that paycheck
[23:13] and I put it I might put it into stocks
[23:15] or real estate or Bitcoin more likely
[23:19] nowadays um but that's gratifying to me
[23:22] that that buying of Bitcoin and and uh
[23:25] yeah that should be it should be
[23:27] gratifying
[23:29] today to save for your future in my
[23:31] opinion it's like paying yourself first
[23:34] like when whenever I feel like it um you
[23:38] have uh like bills coming the electric
[23:41] bill is to do maybe you have to pay rent
[23:44] maybe you have to pay for groceries
[23:46] whatever you have to pay like your for
[23:47] your daily life you always pay someone
[23:50] else the supermarket the the landlord
[23:54] something like that um for savings if
[23:57] you save in Bitcoin like 10% of your
[24:00] income goes directly to bitcoin um this
[24:04] is paying yourself like your future self
[24:08] and I'm always a really big believer in
[24:11] paying yourself actually first that's
[24:13] what I do since yeah years I don't even
[24:16] remember when I started probably like
[24:17] five six years ago or maybe like six
[24:21] seven years ago I'm pretty young with 25
[24:23] now um but it's it's it's fascinating uh
[24:26] for me what it does because whenever I
[24:29] get a paycheck uh and now I get
[24:32] multiples throughout the month whenever
[24:35] something comes in the amount that I
[24:37] don't need about that uh money and I
[24:40] know because I'm doing a strict project
[24:42] thing uh I know exactly what I need I it
[24:46] goes directly into Bitcoin I like I pay
[24:48] myself first I pay myself first in
[24:51] Bitcoin and then afterwards the electric
[24:53] bill comes uh this bill comes this bill
[24:57] comes uh and this is something really
[24:59] beautiful and extremely gratifying for
[25:02] me but I feel like I'm I'm special in
[25:06] that regard uh and you're also probably
[25:08] special in that regard I feel like most
[25:11] of my outside Bitcoin friend outside
[25:15] this financial bubble uh world uh when I
[25:18] talk with with let's say normous with
[25:20] like just random friends um they don't
[25:23] always see it like that uh most of them
[25:25] don't see it like that so where I'm I'm
[25:28] thinking I'm going with with the next
[25:30] question is like when we have switching
[25:33] now from a soft money to a hard money
[25:36] from like feed money to bitcoin could
[25:39] that actually change also Society could
[25:41] that actually like bring this low time
[25:43] preference uh to everybody uh and or not
[25:48] everybody but make it mainstream to be
[25:51] frugal I think it definitely could um it
[25:54] has the potential to because again if
[25:58] you it's like Warren not Warren Buffett
[26:00] but Charlie Munger he says show me the
[26:02] incentive and I'll show you the outcome
[26:05] and so if people notice that shift over
[26:07] time uh but we're still so early I mean
[26:10] there was someone at the Ohio State
[26:11] University maybe you saw the clip but
[26:14] that they mentioned Bitcoin in a
[26:15] commencement address at the end of a a
[26:17] College semester and they got booed and
[26:20] laughed at for mentioning Bitcoin so you
[26:23] know we're still very early but I think
[26:25] um if Bitcoin continues to do what we
[26:28] expect uh and go up in price and really
[26:31] it's I don't even see it as Bitcoin
[26:34] going up I see bit I I largely see it as
[26:36] the dollar going down in value over time
[26:39] but obviously Bitcoin should ACR that
[26:41] value because we are early it's an
[26:42] asymmetric bet and uh the the amount of
[26:46] users adoption over time should have it
[26:50] actually outperform the monetary to
[26:52] basement over time I think but but yeah
[26:55] it could definitely I think shift to to
[26:58] a more frugal even more like a
[27:01] minimalistic
[27:02] society um yeah I I could totally see
[27:05] that happening and I I feel like when
[27:08] when a lot of people ask oh I made like
[27:11] 5% in the stock market or 10% in the
[27:13] stock market what they often don't
[27:16] realize that they didn't made 5% or 10%
[27:20] in the stock market uh they uh just fell
[27:24] down with their debasement like the they
[27:27] calculate in currency that is debased so
[27:30] fast that the mountain is not growing
[27:33] they're falling off the cliff and the
[27:34] mountain is like Rising next to them
[27:37] because they're falling down uh to to
[27:39] the bottom uh and it's kind of this this
[27:42] picture where you are benefiting from
[27:45] Bitcoin um uh when when you get it and
[27:48] when you actually uh calculate in it and
[27:52] for me I'm trying to make this mind
[27:54] switch whenever I do something I'm
[27:57] trying to think of
[27:58] um what does this cost in in Bitcoin
[28:01] especially with big things obviously
[28:03] it's hard to do it with small things but
[28:06] uh if if I really want to maybe invest
[28:08] in this stock that I'm really passionate
[28:11] about does it really outperform Bitcoin
[28:14] in the next 10 years probably not it's
[28:17] really like even if it's outperforms it
[28:20] it does not outperform it by a large
[28:22] margin and why should I invest in it now
[28:25] like it has to be really freaking good
[28:27] like it has to be one of the best stocks
[28:29] in the stock market to outperform
[28:31] bitcoin over the next 10 years because
[28:33] we also have this adoption rate of
[28:36] Bitcoin so why should I invest in it or
[28:38] what should I invest outside of my
[28:41] Bitcoin and the only thing that I can
[28:42] think of is my own company that I'm
[28:44] starting now with content producing and
[28:47] and a lot more things coming the next
[28:48] few months but this is the only thing
[28:50] where I'm like okay I'm willing to
[28:52] invest in in my own company in my own um
[28:55] abilities in my own knowledge this is
[28:57] like the only investment I feel like I'm
[29:00] now comfortable doing outside of Bitcoin
[29:04] everything else is is basically Bitcoin
[29:08] yeah yeah I I I'm kind of on the same
[29:11] page
[29:12] um we you talked about how when you buy
[29:15] stocks and stocks go up 5% you know a
[29:18] lot of times that's almost in
[29:20] conjunction with how much new money is
[29:23] printed and uh you'll see these charts
[29:26] shared by bitcoiners and charts that I
[29:30] had not seen before when I was in the
[29:31] fire movement uh but but it it really
[29:34] shows how the amount of money in
[29:37] circulation directly ties to the stock
[29:40] market
[29:41] indexes and it's it's just a great way
[29:44] of treading water like stocks are a
[29:46] pretty good inflation hedge it appears
[29:49] but yeah you're not really getting ahead
[29:52] unless you're like me maybe if you save
[29:54] 50% of your income and use that money to
[29:57] tread water and you earn some dividends
[29:58] yeah maybe it feels like you're getting
[29:59] ahead and and maybe you picked a few
[30:02] individual stocks that might be winners
[30:03] that get you a little bit ahead but yeah
[30:07] I it's it's ruined Stock Investing for
[30:08] me because a lot of stocks in an index I
[30:11] don't want to own because they make
[30:13] processed foods and junky products and
[30:15] so it's it's really a struggle for me a
[30:17] lot of my stock Investments that are not
[30:20] easy you know I have to pay tax and
[30:22] penalty to get rid of so I'm mostly
[30:25] switched them all away from index funds
[30:27] into to spot Bitcoin ETFs I know that's
[30:31] kind of controversial as a Bitcoin I
[30:33] should hold it in self custody but it's
[30:34] just not easy for me to take a
[30:38] 10% tax haircut and a 10% you know
[30:41] penalty haircut on that and and buy 80%
[30:45] of the Bitcoin when I could pay a small
[30:47] fee for a little bit um so I'm still
[30:49] trying to figure out what to do with
[30:50] that stuff but yeah I've got that and
[30:53] micro strategy obviously is kind of like
[30:55] a
[30:58] you know a good Bitcoin play a leverage
[31:00] Bitcoin play in a way with a profitable
[31:03] uh software business on top so it's it's
[31:06] stock market is really tough for me
[31:08] right now uh to to know what to do and
[31:11] to
[31:12] justify um now that I understand Bitcoin
[31:14] I'm with you on the business my wife
[31:16] owns her business and I'm definitely all
[31:19] about helping her grow that business um
[31:22] and potentially starting my own business
[31:24] one day other than that I'm just focused
[31:25] on increasing my income and saving in
[31:27] Bitcoin
[31:29] and uh I guess in a way kind of getting
[31:32] rid of debt that I don't need which all
[31:33] I have is my mortgage at this point so
[31:36] yeah it's a it's a tricky situation with
[31:38] now with stocks for me if you are
[31:39] listening to this podcast you might be
[31:41] wondering what is actually the setup
[31:43] look like of Robin or how can I improve
[31:46] my Bitcoin setup and there's two things
[31:48] you have to buy Bitcoin from the right
[31:50] source and you have to store Bitcoin the
[31:52] right way let's focus on the first thing
[31:55] how to buy Bitcoin it's simple have a
[31:57] Bitcoin only exchange don't deal with
[31:59] the shitcoin exchanges don't deal with
[32:01] an exchange that has an own token or
[32:03] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[32:06] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[32:09] for me the best partner for that and now
[32:12] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[32:14] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[32:16] a self custody solution where you
[32:20] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[32:22] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[32:26] Solutions that's a bit box you just put
[32:28] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[32:31] fras and you are better than 95% of all
[32:35] Bitcoin hodlers if you have more than a
[32:37] th000 in Bitcoin it's an absolutely must
[32:40] have one last thing before we get back
[32:42] to the video I'm really passionate about
[32:44] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[32:47] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[32:50] in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's
[32:53] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[32:56] conference in whole of Europe for all
[32:58] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[33:00] this place in June for all europes it's
[33:03] a must go anyways you are so close to
[33:06] the Bitcoin PR conference you basically
[33:07] have to come I will do interviews there
[33:10] and I would love to meet you all there
[33:13] use code Robin for all my sponsors to
[33:16] get discounts and use the links down in
[33:18] the description and I hope that stocks
[33:20] get more interesting in the future again
[33:22] because I love the time when I picked
[33:25] stocks um I really love that and I had
[33:29] even great gainers in there and it was
[33:31] fun to stay up till 1:2 in the morning
[33:35] to to watch the the conference
[33:37] conference calls because they were all
[33:39] in America and and I was in Europe uh so
[33:41] this was a fun time honestly and it got
[33:43] me into investing and I hope this time
[33:46] comes back
[33:48] when investing is not about preserving
[33:52] uh the financial energy but actually
[33:55] investing in businesses you believe and
[33:57] you actually gain something from that
[33:59] and you can uh um yeah support the
[34:01] businesses that you think will change
[34:04] the future uh this is for me what
[34:06] investing is and not like oh I don't
[34:08] know what to do with my money and I just
[34:09] put it all in an uh ETF so I I don't
[34:13] lose it all and I can keep up with
[34:15] inflation that is kind of like misusing
[34:18] uh the investing side of things I feel
[34:20] like so Bitcoin is like savings and then
[34:22] investing is completely something uh
[34:25] different which also leavs me to my the
[34:27] next question um what what would you say
[34:31] does Bitcoin success look like when you
[34:35] go ahead and and think like 10 50 maybe
[34:39] even like 100 years into the future uh
[34:42] and and and you look back at at the
[34:45] Bitcoin history um when do we know
[34:49] Bitcoin actually succeeded is it the
[34:51] global Reserve currency status is it uh
[34:54] that feat is not no longer around is it
[34:57] that coin reached a certain massive
[35:00] market capitalization in a fear
[35:01] denominated currency or like how do you
[35:04] see uh the success of Bitcoin when you
[35:06] look back in in maybe like 50
[35:10] years that's a tough one it's hard for
[35:12] me to say
[35:14] um if we'll always have government
[35:16] issued currency side by side with
[35:19] Bitcoin if we eventually get to where
[35:22] every business is a Bitcoin company or
[35:25] or like basically accepts Bitcoin
[35:27] uh that that's a really hard question
[35:29] for me to
[35:30] even guess on or Envision there's a lot
[35:34] smarter people than me but
[35:38] really you know and and what one way I
[35:40] pitch Bitcoin to people though is is
[35:42] just like if you're if you have a
[35:45] prepper tendency if I don't know if
[35:46] you're familiar with Preppers it's kind
[35:48] of an American thing maybe it's in
[35:50] Europe too but people will get like
[35:51] bunkers and they'll get food storage and
[35:54] they'll get bullets and and guns and and
[35:56] coins and physical cash and just like if
[36:00] if things go bad you know they've got a
[36:03] garden they've got uh chickens and stuff
[36:06] and and they've got like supplies like
[36:08] they could
[36:09] live kind of in a broken down society
[36:12] and I I think Bitcoin is one of those
[36:14] tools that you could use in a broken
[36:16] down Society like that but um I I don't
[36:20] really know what it looks like or what I
[36:22] sh what it should look like what what I
[36:25] can say is that in my mind
[36:28] it will always go up like people will
[36:31] get mad at Bitcoin because it's volatile
[36:33] and it goes up and
[36:35] down but
[36:37] that's when you when you have something
[36:39] that's fixed in Supply like Bitcoin
[36:42] being measured against something that is
[36:44] always changing in Supply with like the
[36:47] dollars and every other currency in the
[36:48] world the Yen um pesos whatever whatever
[36:52] currency you want like it's always going
[36:54] to change because everything else is
[36:57] changed in around it so they're the
[37:00] thing is they're so indebted most
[37:02] countries they're going to print more
[37:03] money they're going to monetize their
[37:04] debt it's it's always going to go up
[37:07] it's always going to be volatile too
[37:09] because of these factors because some
[37:10] some countries might tighten their money
[37:13] supply at one point or another some
[37:15] countries might ease their money supply
[37:17] at one point or another so it's it's uh
[37:20] it's tough obviously there's narratives
[37:22] in Bitcoin there's sentiment there's
[37:23] whales there's Traders there's
[37:26] leverage people play different games
[37:28] it's same with the stock market you've
[37:30] got long-term holders short-term holders
[37:33] uh people that are selling options and
[37:34] and puts and stuff like that that I
[37:36] don't fully understand there's swing and
[37:38] momentum Traders people play different
[37:40] games in the stocks similar to how they
[37:43] play different games with currencies and
[37:45] Bitcoin so what does it look
[37:48] like I would love to be able to spend
[37:51] Bitcoin on a daily basis um even my
[37:56] wife's business I think is set up to
[37:58] take Bitcoin but they have not
[37:59] advertised that no one has done it
[38:01] because no one knows about it and even
[38:04] if people knew they took
[38:06] Bitcoin 99% of people don't have any or
[38:10] wouldn't even know how to spend it so I
[38:12] don't I don't know what it looks like um
[38:14] in 10 years other than I I hope I mean
[38:17] even 10 years out but I hope that it
[38:19] continues
[38:20] to to uh basically protect against the
[38:24] de basement and I would love to see more
[38:26] Merchant adoption there's a few
[38:28] Merchants near me And there there's apps
[38:30] that will have the maps showing places
[38:32] that take
[38:33] Bitcoin but yeah I'd love to see it be
[38:36] used as a medium exchange a bit more I
[38:38] think that will help its use case and I
[38:40] think maybe even square is moving that
[38:42] way because now with with square like
[38:45] anyone at the farmers market can convert
[38:46] some of their earnings to
[38:48] bitcoin and it you know it's owned by
[38:51] Jack dorsy so it may not be long before
[38:53] they're accepting Bitcoin as an option
[38:55] of for payment to every everyone that
[38:57] uses Square which is a lot of businesses
[38:59] so yeah that's that's really what I'm
[39:01] hoping for but uh it's hard for me to
[39:04] say 100 years out um other than I hope
[39:08] that it kind
[39:09] of you know I've got three kids and one
[39:11] on the
[39:13] way and I just look at America and I I
[39:17] think like what's it going to look like
[39:19] for them in 10 years when my my oldest
[39:22] is
[39:23] 18 and college costs $400,000 for an
[39:27] under graduate degree the average
[39:29] American house doesn't cost 400,000
[39:31] anymore now it costs 1.2
[39:33] million and right now I think the median
[39:35] household income in America is 75,000 or
[39:38] so 880,000
[39:39] and maybe it's 120,000 but but still
[39:42] like I just don't know how she's going
[39:44] to ever buy a house I don't know
[39:46] how it's going to look and uh it's it's
[39:49] a scary world
[39:51] so that's really what I care about the
[39:53] most is how does it look in the next
[39:55] probably 10 to 20 years is is what I'm
[39:58] focused on because um I plan on helping
[40:01] my kids I save Bitcoin for my kids so I
[40:03] went off on a few tangents there but
[40:05] it's it's hard to
[40:08] say yeah definitely and it's it's um I I
[40:12] mean My Hope Is that Bitcoin makes
[40:14] housing affordable uh when you save uh
[40:18] in Bitcoin and when you have your unit
[40:20] of account in Bitcoin uh I mean we
[40:22] already have seen that in the past 10 15
[40:25] years where when you calculate the house
[40:28] price in US Dollars all of the sudden
[40:30] everything goes up and up and up when
[40:32] you calculate it in Bitcoin every year
[40:34] it gets cheap and cheaper because of
[40:35] course Bitcoin gets adopted and Bitcoin
[40:37] appreciates in value uh long term uh and
[40:41] when more and more people adopt Bitcoin
[40:43] all of the sudden the The Narrative
[40:45] changes are like oh if I adopt Bitcoin
[40:47] housing getting is getting affordable if
[40:50] everybody adopts Bitcoin housing is
[40:52] getting affordable for everybody maybe
[40:54] not in 10 years maybe 10 years a little
[40:56] bit um too early for that um but uh
[41:00] definitely if you save in Bitcoin for
[41:02] your kids especially they will be able
[41:05] to to buy multiple houses probably with
[41:08] uh those Bitcoins uh because uh you
[41:11] saved in uh really sound money really
[41:14] early on and they can have the fruits of
[41:17] that uh wisdom of of of yours if if I
[41:21] can say say it like that um which also
[41:24] brings me to an interesting conversation
[41:26] because you mentioned it the future of
[41:28] Education I mean in Europe when you go
[41:31] to college it does not cost anything I
[41:33] maybe in some areas but in Austria for
[41:35] example you don't spend any dollars uh
[41:38] for Education here like you go to
[41:41] university uh you have to pay small fees
[41:44] this is like under1 EUR per per semester
[41:48] uh if you have if you take longer than
[41:51] normal uh you have to pay like a fine
[41:53] for like 300 or 400 per semester it's
[41:56] basically nothing compared to that what
[41:58] an America universi cost uh which I
[42:02] think is also resulting in higher
[42:06] quality universities in America because
[42:09] uh there is more money in there uh of
[42:11] course uh uh but in general even in
[42:15] Austria more and more people are opting
[42:17] out of that traditional University and
[42:20] education system and more like okay
[42:22] let's let's get to work and uh if I want
[42:25] to educate myself in some thing uh I can
[42:29] find that in a more decentralized way
[42:31] there's also like Michael sailor who
[42:32] wants to do like
[42:34] online uh University where how is it
[42:38] called sailor Academy or something like
[42:40] that yeah um where he even puts like MIT
[42:44] classes on there so like where do you
[42:48] see this this this future of of of
[42:50] Education with the internet and like
[42:53] this kind of more modern uh media and
[42:56] and where people like and kids can get
[42:59] educated in a more decentralized
[43:02] way H yeah I
[43:05] mean that's a tough one for me it's it's
[43:07] hard for me to to think about um I I do
[43:10] I do um know some private schools um
[43:15] where it's still possible there's
[43:16] there's places you can go um I know
[43:20] there's a college where every the the
[43:23] college um campus is ran and maintained
[43:26] by stud students so all the
[43:28] janitorial all of the Landscaping so
[43:31] every every student on campus has a job
[43:34] and they help maintain everything so
[43:38] that uh the cost of tuition is cheaper
[43:40] so I know there's places that you can
[43:41] get a good education get your
[43:44] undergraduate uh for your degree uh for
[43:47] for probably in the 40 to 50K range for
[43:51] you know that's not too bad about 10,000
[43:53] a year 12,000 a year um so I know that
[43:56] there's ways of doing it but uh I you
[44:00] know in America we have these 529
[44:02] accounts that are tax uh tax deductible
[44:06] they save you money on taxes uh and they
[44:08] they have to go towards education but
[44:11] I've I've uh I've actually foregone
[44:12] those I do I do do a uh sorry I use a
[44:17] custodial brokerage account actually for
[44:19] my kids and I'm a little bit torn on
[44:21] this but uh I'm just putting in 600
[44:24] bucks a year about 50 bucks a month for
[44:27] each kid uh and that's that's what I'm
[44:30] doing for them other than that I'm just
[44:31] saving in Bitcoin for my kids um so
[44:35] that's that's really my strategy is the
[44:37] custodial
[44:38] account depending on how old my kid is
[44:42] that $600 a year is going to you know if
[44:44] the stock market does its 8% on average
[44:47] and basically Treads water with
[44:49] inflation it's going to be something
[44:50] there for them it's going to have a
[44:52] decent little base to hopefully pay a
[44:54] year or two of college and and the cool
[44:57] thing about who I use it's it's a it's
[44:59] an app called early
[45:01] bird and grandparents can can contribute
[45:05] aunts and uncles can contribute um you
[45:07] can you also add moments you you add
[45:10] these pictures and and videos and
[45:12] memories you can leave them messages and
[45:14] advice and so it's kind of like this uh
[45:17] memory and
[45:19] money custodial brokerage Vault uh so so
[45:22] any it's kind of cool but like my oldest
[45:25] has about $1,500 in her account
[45:28] and projected value at 18 using Average
[45:32] stock returns is about
[45:33] $122,000 you know my next youngest kid
[45:37] started younger and so and he has longer
[45:39] to go it's going to be about $155,000
[45:42] and my youngest should get about
[45:44] $21,000 based on just historical stock
[45:47] returns and anyway that's uh that's what
[45:50] I do for them it with the custodial
[45:52] Brokers they can use that money to buy a
[45:54] house they can use it to buy real estate
[45:57] start a
[45:57] business um to travel the world to you
[46:02] know they could use it for anything they
[46:03] want really uh to buy a car so it's a
[46:06] lot more flexible it doesn't only have
[46:08] the tax advantage for either one of us
[46:11] but it is a way to give them flexibility
[46:14] so that's what I'm using is a custodial
[46:16] Brokerage in conjunction with Bitcoin so
[46:19] yeah that's that's how I look at it um
[46:21] and then part of me thinks that uh
[46:27] you know kids do so many
[46:28] extracurriculars these days that parents
[46:30] are just shuttling them around I'd love
[46:33] if my
[46:34] kids uh maybe did less extracurriculars
[46:37] and actually had jobs in high school is
[46:40] kind of My Hope and even jobs working
[46:42] for my wife's business if they can in
[46:44] some capacity um actually building
[46:47] skills potentially trying to get them to
[46:50] do apprenticeships on trades uh so they
[46:53] always have something that to fall back
[46:54] on or a side hustle like
[46:57] if if my kids could know a side hustle
[46:59] of uh of doing carpentry work or
[47:02] something like that I think that's
[47:03] always valuable they could again they
[47:06] could buy use Furniture Fix and Flip it
[47:09] but yeah basically I'm just trying to
[47:10] find any Avenue for my kids to
[47:13] build real marketable skills before they
[47:17] even go to college and if they end up
[47:19] getting a white color job and being a
[47:20] programmer or a doctor or a lawyer or
[47:23] whatever it is that's great but they
[47:25] also need to have a hard skill in my
[47:29] opinion and it's so important to uh
[47:32] teach them that and I'm really
[47:34] passionate about that I myself uh
[47:36] started working even in school already
[47:39] like before uh going to University uh I
[47:42] had like a school that was like uh 8 38
[47:46] 39 40 hours a week plus homework plus
[47:49] preparation for uh exams and stuff like
[47:52] that and on top of that I worked between
[47:55] five to 10 hours a week uh and all the
[48:00] all the money that I made because I was
[48:01] still living in my parents house
[48:03] obviously I directly invested like I had
[48:06] a savings rate basically of 100% because
[48:08] my parents paid for my um living
[48:11] situation and I worked so I had
[48:14] everything like I I say I basically
[48:17] saved in total Euros amounts probably
[48:20] more than the average Austrian with like
[48:22] 17 18 years old uh because uh I just say
[48:27] everything I did not buy anything with
[48:29] it I did not go on parties on with that
[48:31] anything and that's how I actually got
[48:34] ahead really early on because I invested
[48:36] in researched a lot got also in Bitcoin
[48:39] quite early uh so like this this this I
[48:43] only had this opportunity because I had
[48:45] money uh when I did not had the job I
[48:48] probably would have not gone into
[48:50] investing because I did not had any any
[48:53] money to distribute so if you don't have
[48:55] any money to save uh you don't look into
[48:58] savings uh and that's that's why I'm
[49:00] really passionate about uh getting
[49:03] getting kids as soon as possible at
[49:06] least a small side job it doesn't has to
[49:08] be like a 30h hour job or something like
[49:10] that but like 5 10 maybe 15 hours
[49:13] depending on how much they do uh that's
[49:16] that's great for them to learn uh like a
[49:19] hard skill how and to learn like what
[49:22] what is the world outside of school like
[49:24] what is the actual world like where uh
[49:27] outside of school where people actually
[49:28] work uh that's that's a really cool
[49:31] thing that you're trying also to to do
[49:34] that yeah even even just uh mowing the
[49:37] lawn um my my 5-year-old and my
[49:40] eight-year-old actually mowed the lawn
[49:42] part of it for the first time this last
[49:45] week and uh I don't expect them to do
[49:48] the whole yard but I try to give them a
[49:49] section to do and and I tell them like
[49:52] at some point you're going to do this
[49:54] whole thing and if if you want to make
[49:57] money you could actually go to a
[49:58] neighbor and probably make $30 you know
[50:01] that's enough money to go to the arcade
[50:02] twice and so that's kind of they they're
[50:06] you know they perked up when they heard
[50:07] that like oh I could go to the arcade
[50:08] twice and and play games and stuff if I
[50:12] work hard for one hour and mow a lawn
[50:15] you know so that that kind of gets them
[50:16] thinking even at a young age what they
[50:18] can do um you know and my it's tough
[50:21] because my oldest she wants to be an
[50:23] artist and you know I don't even try to
[50:26] plant ideas in their head of what to be
[50:29] when what they could be when they grow
[50:30] up I do try to point out interesting
[50:32] jobs like whenever I see a uh a person
[50:35] working on a power line after a storm
[50:38] and I I point out jobs like that you
[50:39] know just things that they would not
[50:41] even think about uh there there's a lot
[50:43] of different types of jobs that are not
[50:45] advertised um that that can be lucrative
[50:48] that can be technical that can be fun
[50:49] and
[50:50] challenging um but my oldest wants to be
[50:52] an artist so uh I don't know if you're
[50:55] familiar with Mark Rober
[50:58] um a YouTube guy but he's got uh he's
[51:01] got this thing called crunch labs and he
[51:03] teaches these kids engineering things
[51:06] and uh they they build these these
[51:09] little uh they basically build their own
[51:11] toys um that you know it's like a trip
[51:14] wire that shoots uh these little foam
[51:17] balls at you if you if you trip over the
[51:20] the string or it's a it's a dis launcher
[51:23] and there was one that was recently art
[51:25] focused so I'm trying to get my my
[51:28] daughter who's very interested in art
[51:29] she wants to sell paintings I'm trying
[51:32] to show her that you can do art in
[51:33] different ways um and I'd like to buy a
[51:37] 3D printer and like a laser etcher and
[51:40] and see like hey look you can do art
[51:43] with a laser you can do art with a 3D
[51:46] printer you can make something beautiful
[51:48] that people will buy or or something
[51:50] useful you can engineer and design a
[51:52] useful product that has you know artsy
[51:56] elements to it so I'm I'm trying to to
[51:59] leverage the interest in art to you know
[52:03] tie it into something more engineering
[52:06] focused so they can make something cool
[52:09] but uh it it's it's uh it's an
[52:11] interesting challenge that I'm working
[52:13] on I love it I love how you how how you
[52:17] approach this this topic and before we
[52:20] get to our end routine of the podcast
[52:22] and before we get to to the end of the
[52:24] podcast um I'm trying to ask all my my
[52:28] guests what are they currently really
[52:30] passionate about outside of Bitcoin and
[52:34] frugality and what we all touched on the
[52:37] in this podcast episode is there
[52:38] anything that you're really passionate
[52:39] about uh in in your life in in what
[52:42] you're maybe currently learning or
[52:45] currently pursuing that we did not touch
[52:47] on till now yeah I'm GNA I'm going to
[52:51] touch on three things um one thing that
[52:54] I'm really interested in that I
[52:55] mentioned is is dirt bikes that I gave
[52:57] up for so long um I follow the pro dirt
[53:00] bike racers one thing that's really cool
[53:03] about racing a dirt bike is that at the
[53:07] professional
[53:08] level it's very
[53:11] accessible uh most Motorsports car
[53:13] racing whether it's Indie Car
[53:17] F1 joeo off the street
[53:20] cannot they will never have a chance to
[53:23] to do any sort of Motorsport like that
[53:25] but one thing I like about dirt bike
[53:26] racers is you've got the professionals
[53:30] that are sponsored by a factory teams
[53:32] racing against um a guy that uh builds
[53:35] houses during the week and he shows up
[53:37] but he's he's a good Rider and he can
[53:39] buy a dirt bike and he can race it on
[53:42] the weekend and uh dirt bikes are
[53:44] getting more and more expensive I've
[53:46] actually uh charted out the price of a
[53:48] dirt bike in in dollars and in Bitcoin
[53:52] and so it's it's uh something I'm trying
[53:55] to there was actually a an exchange that
[53:57] sponsored American Supercross last year
[54:00] called smarty they were kind of a
[54:03] Celsius Celsius like they had their own
[54:05] token and they had loans and stuff and I
[54:07] don't know if they're still kicking or
[54:08] not but I I found it was interesting um
[54:12] that at least it kind of got crypto a
[54:15] little bit maybe Bitcoin in front of
[54:16] people uh although you know most cryptos
[54:19] I would say are scams but I do have this
[54:22] passion for trying to
[54:24] show people that ride dirt bikes and an
[54:27] expensive hobby that Bitcoin can help
[54:29] them that uh these Weekend Warriors that
[54:33] work a normal job but that can still go
[54:35] make a professional main event on the
[54:37] weekend that Bitcoin can make their
[54:40] lives easier if they save in Bitcoin if
[54:41] they if they uh are able to kind of
[54:45] build up up a cushion and over time save
[54:48] money in Bitcoin so that's that's one
[54:50] thing I'm passionate about um the other
[54:53] thing that Bitcoin has kind of done for
[54:55] me is it's given me a much bigger
[54:59] interest in my health and I've I've
[55:01] completely changed my diet um and not
[55:04] only just for me but for my kids but
[55:06] getting them off of
[55:08] cheit and and processed foods and snacks
[55:11] like that and into other things um even
[55:14] if it's just jerky you know there's it's
[55:17] still going to be processed to some
[55:18] degree my kids
[55:19] are unfortunately kind of used to you
[55:22] know some of those Fiat Foods you could
[55:24] say but there are some brands that don't
[55:28] have seed oils that don't have as many
[55:31] preservatives and so we've been Shifting
[55:33] the cereals that they eat away from
[55:35] cereals into more eggs and homemade
[55:38] sourdough toast and stuff like that uh
[55:41] instead of bread that has all this
[55:43] garbage in it so I'm also just learning
[55:46] to cook I've never cooked anything
[55:48] pretty much until this year and because
[55:50] of Bitcoin I've I've got this huge
[55:52] interest in cooking which is uh great
[55:54] for not just only our health but it's
[55:57] also great for my wife and taking that
[55:59] load off of her a little bit more so uh
[56:03] finally we we talked about this with
[56:05] frugality a little bit but I wanted to
[56:07] mention this concept that I don't think
[56:09] a lot of people have heard of they might
[56:12] um intuitively know about it but it's
[56:14] this concept that is it's vital to my
[56:19] frugality it's vital to my understanding
[56:21] of life it's called hedonic adaptation
[56:24] have you have you heard of that you
[56:25] familiar with that term
[56:27] uh no okay so maybe uh some people might
[56:30] hear it more in association in
[56:32] association with uh the honic treadmill
[56:36] which is kind of the idea of keeping up
[56:39] with the Joneses that your neighbor gets
[56:42] the new car and so you get the new car
[56:45] you get you make more money in your
[56:46] career and so you upgrade your house you
[56:49] kind of upgrade your lifestyle you got
[56:50] this lifestyle inflation this lifestyle
[56:53] creep over time where you just want more
[56:56] and more and more um but hedonic
[56:59] adaptation kind of flips it on its head
[57:02] and it's it's just a study of Happiness
[57:05] there was a a study on happiness
[57:07] conducted and it's been replicated many
[57:09] times but what it found is they had
[57:13] people rate their happiness over time
[57:15] and some of the people in the study won
[57:18] the lottery and other people in the
[57:20] study actually got paralyzed from the
[57:22] waist down and so they studied these
[57:25] people like
[57:27] I'm just saying I'm an active person I
[57:28] ride bikes I run I work out I I do all
[57:32] these things with my kids you know I'm
[57:33] the parent that's actually not sitting
[57:35] on the bench on my phone at the
[57:37] playground but I'm actually playing with
[57:38] my kids if I lost my ability to walk I'd
[57:41] be pretty devastated I think what they
[57:44] found in studying people is that when
[57:47] they were
[57:49] paralyzed you know their happiness was
[57:51] kind of at a certain level before and
[57:54] then it went way down but within 6
[57:57] months after their accident of being
[57:59] paralyzed they go back to their Baseline
[58:02] level of happiness that they had before
[58:03] the accident so basically you can still
[58:06] be happy when you're paralyzed when you
[58:08] have this big life tragedy you're going
[58:11] to go back to this everyone kind of has
[58:13] a baseline level of Happiness you're
[58:14] going to go right back to it within six
[58:16] months or less same thing for the
[58:18] lottery winners you think it's like this
[58:20] huge thing life is just going to be
[58:22] great you've got millions of dollars in
[58:24] the bank now not so you're going to have
[58:27] a spike in happiness and then you're
[58:28] going to go right back to the same level
[58:30] of happiness that you had before and so
[58:33] what that teaches me is that you can
[58:35] choose to adapt upwards or downwards
[58:39] either way you're going to be about the
[58:41] same level of happiness and so I can
[58:45] downgrade my car like if you were
[58:48] driving a Tesla and you downgraded to my
[58:50] car which is a six uh
[58:53] $600 uh junky old Chevy
[58:57] uh you're going to be bummed because
[58:59] it's not fast it's not as comfortable uh
[59:02] the door is kind of janky it's hard to
[59:04] close you
[59:05] know uh it it it doesn't even have um a
[59:09] USB port that you can plug in your phone
[59:12] and listen to music you have to use the
[59:13] radio still you're going to be bummed
[59:16] downgrading your car but within six
[59:18] months you won't even care you're your H
[59:20] your happiness level is going to be the
[59:22] same because you just get used to things
[59:25] up or down so I uh I intentionally
[59:28] choose to challenge myself and to
[59:30] downgrade My Lifestyle at times and not
[59:33] just upgrade it because I know I'll
[59:34] still be happy over the long term so
[59:36] that's a that's a powerful concept that
[59:38] people can experiment with you can
[59:40] downgrade your life and it might suck at
[59:42] first but eventually you'll you'll go
[59:45] back to the same level of Happiness as
[59:46] you had
[59:48] before and that's uh that's an amazing
[59:50] inside honestly and uh I can just uh add
[59:55] one personal note in there uh I because
[59:59] I made some some gains in in the stock
[60:01] market I made an mistake and bought a
[60:05] Tesla because I mentioned it and what I
[60:08] what I found was exactly that with six
[60:10] month uh it was amazing to drive this
[60:14] thing the first one two months uh it was
[60:17] really cool the first month it was
[60:18] amazing for me and in the second two
[60:21] three months it was amazing because I
[60:23] could um show it to my friends and it
[60:26] was like nice to share this kind of
[60:28] experience uh and then after like four
[60:32] five months and probably right around
[60:35] the six month period it's it just gets
[60:38] normal like you get used to that uh and
[60:42] then I decided it's actually not worth
[60:45] it like the extra money that it costs
[60:47] and the extra money you have to put in
[60:48] there it's it's just not worth it
[60:51] because it does not give you uh the
[60:53] happiness long term I mean if if you
[60:56] having a lot of money and you have a
[60:57] great business H there's nothing wrong
[60:59] with expensive cars if you can afford it
[61:01] and stuff like that like you enjoy your
[61:03] life uh but if like it it does not
[61:08] change anything like happiness does not
[61:10] come from money it might make things
[61:12] easier if you have a lot of money but it
[61:15] does not come from money yeah that
[61:18] that's that's the main point for me and
[61:20] I use cars as an example but you know
[61:23] I've also downgraded my life at one
[61:25] point Point uh where we lived in a nice
[61:28] house five-bedroom three bath bigger
[61:30] than we needed great place right next to
[61:32] a park you know we moved across the
[61:35] country for a job and downgraded to a
[61:38] two-bedroom apartment and uh with a lady
[61:42] that would you know hit the broom on the
[61:43] ceiling when my kids were too loud so uh
[61:46] we were still happy and then we ended up
[61:48] in a condo and now we're back in a house
[61:50] so we we
[61:52] downgraded so that we could upgrade
[61:54] later uh we did it knowing and it's just
[61:58] easier to do if you need to get a goal
[62:01] done if you need to get a business off
[62:02] the ground like we talked about earlier
[62:04] to to to delay that de gratification but
[62:06] just to know that you'll still be happy
[62:08] it's going to be hard sometimes at first
[62:10] but you just get used to it like you
[62:12] said up or down you get used to it
[62:15] amazing yeah it's uh great insights that
[62:19] you're sharing today with us um we're
[62:21] coming to the end routine where the
[62:23] previous guest is asking a question for
[62:24] the next guest without knowing who the
[62:26] next guest actually is uh and the
[62:29] question for you is and it's an
[62:31] interesting one and you can take it uh
[62:33] or interpret it however you you want to
[62:35] do it um what value do you find in what
[62:39] you are
[62:40] doing okay what value do I find in what
[62:43] I'm doing my is that in any aspect of
[62:48] life I mean uh I try to not limit the
[62:52] the question and also not limit the
[62:53] answer so like you you can interpret it
[62:56] uh as however you you want to take it
[62:58] like take it in the direction that you
[63:00] feel comfortable in sure
[63:04] um okay what what I would start with is
[63:07] that uh there's this quote that comes to
[63:09] mind that
[63:11] says no I'm probably going to butcher it
[63:14] but it says no success in life will
[63:17] compensate for failure in the home so
[63:20] the the biggest value that I can bring
[63:23] in my life is to my wife and kids and to
[63:27] basically teach my kids the right
[63:29] principles and let them make their own
[63:31] choices and set set an example for them
[63:34] and try to prepare them for life that is
[63:37] my my number one priority my number one
[63:40] focus in life is to provide not just
[63:45] provide the the needs of life for my
[63:47] family but to provide a framework and
[63:49] and be a leader and a guide for my
[63:51] family so that's that's number one
[63:53] that's that's my
[63:54] main value proposition that I need to
[63:57] focus on other than you know my career
[63:59] is secondary to that
[64:02] um but uh I definitely in my career I I
[64:06] try to build my skills to be valuable in
[64:09] the marketplace and I I try to um give
[64:12] more to my company I try to I try to be
[64:14] fair to the company I work for and make
[64:18] sure that I'm giving what I need to
[64:20] there and I I want to say giving my all
[64:24] uh but but some sometimes that's not the
[64:26] case um but uh you know I I need to I
[64:30] basically I don't want to cheat any
[64:32] company that I work for I want to have a
[64:34] fair value exchange if that makes sense
[64:36] but uh but yeah the biggest value I can
[64:38] bring in life is is number one to my
[64:40] family and friends and you know
[64:43] everything else is kind of secondary to
[64:45] that in my
[64:46] opinion it was great talking with you st
[64:48] it uh you brought a really nice and
[64:51] fresh perspective on the things that you
[64:53] usually talk about Bitcoin and frugality
[64:55] and and and life in general um before I
[64:59] let you go uh where can uh people reach
[65:02] out to you where can people reach you in
[65:04] the in the best way still like a a way
[65:07] they can get in touch with you yeah uh
[65:10] probably the best way is um I'm Stu
[65:12] Frugal on Twitter that's St F Ru I mean
[65:17] I think people know how to spell Frugal
[65:18] but Stu is what I go by on on there um
[65:23] and I've got my own little podcast
[65:25] called Bitcoin and financial
[65:26] Independence it's a solo show for the
[65:29] most part I rarely have guests we talked
[65:31] about this before the show a little bit
[65:33] but yeah I uh need to be a little bit
[65:35] more consistent in having episodes but
[65:38] it it is very hard with a a growing
[65:41] young family at this point in life so uh
[65:44] trying to trying to uh do that when I
[65:46] can U but yeah that's that's where you
[65:49] can follow me the most probably is on
[65:50] Twitter and Noster
[65:53] [Music]
