[00:00] over the last couple of years as it has
[00:01] gotten more and more inevitable, as it
[00:03] really has become money in a real way,
[00:06] the best savings technology ever
[00:08] invented. I believe that we're going to
[00:09] see something similar with Bitcoin
[00:11] itself, specifically around its utility.
[00:14] And I'm not talking about trading in and
[00:15] out. I'm talking about using it as the
[00:18] pristine collateral that it is. When you
[00:21] combine the two, whether it's debt or,
[00:23] you know, some sort of structured credit
[00:25] with Bitcoin, it makes the whole package
[00:27] much much stronger. The danger, I guess,
[00:29] would be borrow a ton of fiat to buy
[00:33] Bitcoin. But then the trick is how do
[00:35] you make those payments? And if you have
[00:36] a way to make those payments that's
[00:37] locked in so that people are going to
[00:39] come in and take your Bitcoin, that is a
[00:41] trade worth making all day, every day.
[00:43] It's going to be increasingly incumbent
[00:46] on you to secure your Bitcoin in the
[00:49] perfect way. It's easier said than done
[00:51] to take somebody's Bitcoin, right?
[00:52] You're transferring it from one wallet
[00:54] to the next. It's on the chain. it's
[00:56] going to get seen and getting it into a
[00:59] way where you can literally, you know,
[01:01] ride off into the sunset is easier said
[01:02] than done.
[01:05] [Music]
[01:08] Before we get started, um, who who who
[01:11] are you and and and why are you into
[01:13] Bitcoin? I am, let's what's the best way
[01:16] to answer that? Uh, I am a guy who got
[01:20] into Bitcoin a little bit in 2017. I'm
[01:23] in that class of 2017 when everybody was
[01:25] sort of dabbling. It was just as Bitcoin
[01:28] was sort of bursting into the public
[01:30] consciousness as I recall. Um, in
[01:33] America we have uh Thanksgiving in
[01:35] November and over Thanksgiving dinner
[01:37] like people's grandparents would be
[01:38] asking about Bitcoin. It was it was a it
[01:41] was a pretty popular um topic of
[01:43] conversation a couple of months before
[01:46] um before the entire thing uh collapsed.
[01:50] Um, but to get back to your question, I
[01:53] got into Bitcoin primarily around the
[01:55] technology of it. Not so much about
[01:57] sound money and what it's become in my
[01:59] mind since then. Um, I've been an
[02:03] entrepreneur. I've co-founded or founded
[02:06] several companies um, and have had
[02:08] several exits and so and they all have a
[02:10] technological element to them. not you
[02:12] know big tech certainly but have had a
[02:15] had a data or weboriented
[02:18] um aspect to them each of the pieces
[02:20] that um you each of those companies that
[02:23] I've co-ounded and so the technology of
[02:26] Bitcoin was what sort of captured my
[02:29] interest at the beginning um but then
[02:31] over the years and I've had a couple of
[02:34] um ups and downs just like so many
[02:36] people have in each of the last epochs
[02:39] um over the last couple of years and has
[02:41] it as it has gotten more and more
[02:43] inevitable as it really has become uh
[02:46] money in a real way. The best savings
[02:48] technology ever invented. Um I've
[02:51] started to think about it in a different
[02:52] way. So today what I what I am is um an
[02:56] executive and a consultant and an
[02:58] entrepreneur on the one hand and also uh
[03:01] an adviser specifically with the Bitcoin
[03:03] adviser which I know your audience is
[03:05] familiar with uh through some of your
[03:07] guests in the past. Um and specifically
[03:09] what the Bitcoin advisor does is help
[03:11] people um reduce or or eliminate the
[03:14] single point of failure for their
[03:16] self-custody. We help people um uh set
[03:20] up and manage multi-IG um multiig vaults
[03:24] basically. So that's a part of my
[03:25] business and then the other part is
[03:26] consulting um primarily to family
[03:29] offices and um and high netw worth
[03:32] individuals around film finance which is
[03:34] a big part of my background. Yeah. 2017
[03:38] was was was madness. I I I remember I I
[03:41] came into Bitcoin in 2020, but I got
[03:44] introduced in 2017 because there was a
[03:47] friend of mine that want to get me into
[03:48] Bitcoin, but not really into Bitcoin. He
[03:51] had a pyramid scheme around Bitcoin like
[03:53] or he was involved in a pyramid scheme
[03:55] around Bitcoin and I was that's why I
[03:58] was really convinced Bitcoin is a scam
[04:00] from that moment onwards because it
[04:02] connected those two things. And I
[04:03] remember one time and it's so funny. I
[04:06] remember I was sitting on a in a coffee
[04:08] in Austria and I was talking about that
[04:11] uh and I used the word Bitcoin and
[04:13] someone on the next table turned to me
[04:15] like oh don't get into that because it's
[04:17] a scam. So 2017 it was it was like
[04:22] everyone talked about it. I've never
[04:25] seen this amount of craziness around
[04:27] Bitcoin ever since 2017.
[04:31] Yeah. Well, I mean there's been there's
[04:33] been ups and downs, right? But there
[04:35] yeah there was something special about
[04:36] that era where it captured the public
[04:39] consciousness for the first time. I
[04:41] think um I had first heard about Bitcoin
[04:43] from the tech press. I remember Wired
[04:46] magazine was um uh back when it really
[04:49] still loved technology that magazine.
[04:51] They paid a lot of attention to Bitcoin
[04:54] itself as well as some of the other um
[04:57] the other blockchain technologies that
[04:59] were coming along the pike at that
[05:00] point. And it felt more like technology.
[05:03] Again, I sort of basically I started
[05:06] this the entrepreneurial path that I had
[05:08] I've been on now for a while in roughly
[05:10] 2009 10 11 somewhere in there. Um I'm
[05:14] not a developer or an engineer. It's
[05:16] just that by that period um the I think
[05:19] the iPhone had was either launching or
[05:21] had just launched and sort of this the
[05:23] the next wave the mobile internet was
[05:26] really sort of bursting into um or or
[05:29] was sort of flowering right and and
[05:32] Bitcoin came along around that same time
[05:34] um we had come through the dot crash and
[05:37] we're coming out the other side with uh
[05:39] Google and Meta and or Facebook at the
[05:42] time and a bunch of you know this giant
[05:44] you know Deca unicorns that we know now.
[05:47] That was all just starting to come
[05:49] along. Um, and that was what I was
[05:51] paying attention to at the time. And
[05:53] Bitcoin sort of fit into that. And then
[05:55] as the technology side of things went
[05:57] from web one web 1.0 to 2.0 and then
[06:00] what we called web 3.0 0 for a while.
[06:03] Um, that was really a part of how I was
[06:06] thinking about it because again, I I was
[06:08] sort of an entrepreneur in companies
[06:10] that were harnessing some of those those
[06:12] technologies and we were thinking about
[06:14] blockchain um and tokenization as
[06:16] something that we might be able to do at
[06:18] uh this company I worked at called
[06:19] Slated, which we can talk about if you'd
[06:21] like. Super interesting. I want to show
[06:24] you something. Uh, and I'm curious what
[06:25] what you say because uh for you 2017 was
[06:28] the the starting point and uh when you I
[06:32] mean you're well aware of Google Trends
[06:33] I guess. Um and you can see here at 2017
[06:36] we had this massive spike. We have
[06:38] another one at 2021 which was way
[06:40] smaller than than that and and now we
[06:43] are at like 8% where we were from 2017
[06:47] but we are 400% higher from the from the
[06:50] price around that that amount.
[06:52] specifically with the phrase buy
[06:54] Bitcoin. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. If you
[06:57] don't mind me ripping on these, go
[06:58] ahead. Go ahead. I I just wanted to say
[07:01] with buy Bitcoin, I I use buy Bitcoin
[07:04] more
[07:05] because it's it shows more the retail
[07:08] crowd. I think if you use Bitcoin
[07:10] generally, it can also show good data
[07:12] and and we can just just do that for
[07:15] comparisons. Uh but but I like buy
[07:18] Bitcoin because it represents how well
[07:21] the retail crowd comes in. So with bit
[07:25] Bitcoin the the term it's not at 8% it's
[07:27] at 24% which is a lot higher uh than 8%
[07:32] but still quite a ways down. Yeah. So
[07:36] these two main spikes and also it was
[07:38] represented on the previous graph um
[07:41] definitely aligns with my experience.
[07:43] Right. So, I came in at the 2017 spike.
[07:46] Um, I should hasten to add that, um,
[07:48] when I first got into it, it was really
[07:50] low lowkey. It was a few thousand that
[07:53] I, you know, I would have, I would have,
[07:55] maybe I wouldn't literally go up to a
[07:57] craps table in Las Vegas with a couple
[08:00] of thousand dollars. I have many friends
[08:01] who do that. That's just not my jam. Um,
[08:04] but it was a couple of thousand dollars
[08:05] that I didn't I didn't like I wouldn't
[08:07] lose sleep at night if I lost it. Um,
[08:10] and it was at a time when it was at the
[08:12] beginning of that first spike and I
[08:14] thought I was a genius and I was talking
[08:15] to not it wasn't my genius but I was you
[08:18] know thanking my lucky stars that I was
[08:20] getting in cuz I don't remember that
[08:21] first that first uh purchase price but
[08:24] it was probably I don't know 2,000 3,000
[08:27] something like that and it spiked way up
[08:29] to like 17,000 something like that 19
[08:32] maybe at the at the real peak but then
[08:34] crashed way down and suddenly and it
[08:36] wasn't just Bitcoin for me it was the
[08:38] shitcoins as Well, um, because again, it
[08:41] was more of a gambling thing. Which
[08:42] which coins do people think are going to
[08:44] go up and I'm going to try to get in a
[08:46] little early? That was the that was the
[08:48] ethos or the the mindset of retail at
[08:51] that point. And then just to skip to
[08:52] that next hump in 2021 when it spikes
[08:56] again, my experience of that was logging
[08:59] back into a bunch of these accounts that
[09:00] I had literally had not looked at in 4
[09:03] years, expecting that they were all
[09:05] dust, but just curious. And no, it had
[09:07] ramped up by four or 5x from the last
[09:10] time I looked at it, which is which is a
[09:13] a um it's a learning point for me. The
[09:17] the the low time preference lesson there
[09:19] was really interesting and I and you
[09:21] know I I liquidated my stuff and we you
[09:24] know bought some stuff. We took care of
[09:26] you know we took care of stuff. I wasn't
[09:28] in Bitcoin maxi mindset at the time. I
[09:31] wasn't thinking of it as savings
[09:32] technology. I just thought I had lucked
[09:34] into this little mini lottery winning,
[09:37] you know, bought a ticket and it turned
[09:38] out okay and took my stuff off the
[09:40] table. Um, and then I I got I got sort
[09:43] of sucked in like so many people into
[09:45] the, you know, buy Bitcoin on the on the
[09:48] exchanges, lever up and lever up and
[09:49] lever up and then got liquidated over
[09:52] the at the next time it um it crashed
[09:55] again. So, I learned from that thing,
[09:56] too. So, rule number one is you do not
[09:59] sell your Bitcoin. is definitely
[10:01] imprinted on my soul at this point.
[10:03] Yeah, you always regret. I I never I
[10:06] never saw a person that didn't regret um
[10:09] selling selling Bitcoin. Um it's really
[10:12] interesting because you were so active
[10:13] in the internet adoption also with the
[10:15] companies and and all that. What have
[10:17] you learned from the internet adoption
[10:18] that you kind of now see with with
[10:21] Bitcoin? Oh, that's an interesting
[10:22] question. Um well the thing that comes
[10:25] to mind when you ask that question is
[10:28] the parallel between the utility of the
[10:33] internet over time just increased
[10:36] exponentially. I don't know if that's
[10:37] literally the right term but probably
[10:39] right that that's a pretty steep spike.
[10:41] And I think that we're I believe that
[10:43] we're going to see something um similar
[10:45] with Bitcoin itself specifically around
[10:48] its utility. And I'm not talking about
[10:50] trading in and out. I'm talking about
[10:52] using it as the pristine collateral that
[10:55] it is. Um, I've been noodling around
[10:58] with a model to um to basically to
[11:02] finance independent films that uses
[11:03] Bitcoin in a similar way to uh the way
[11:06] Battery and New Market are are sort of
[11:09] experimenting with ways to include
[11:11] Bitcoin uh in commercial real estate
[11:14] loans. Um, and the point of bringing
[11:16] this up is that when you when you
[11:18] combine the two, you know, whether it's
[11:21] debt or, you know, some sort of
[11:22] structured credit um thing with Bitcoin,
[11:25] it makes the whole package much much
[11:27] stronger. And we don't have to dwell on
[11:29] this, but to to get back to your to your
[11:31] point, we're now, you know, from the
[11:34] beginning of Bitcoin until now, we're
[11:36] starting to see it become so
[11:39] um become become part of the
[11:42] infrastructure of the global financial
[11:44] system in a way that it the the risk of
[11:46] it going to zero is effective, you know,
[11:48] pretty close to zero. I would say zero,
[11:51] but I don't like to be, you know, I
[11:52] don't like to be binary that way, but I
[11:54] believe that it's here to stay. And if
[11:56] it's here to stay, then it's going to
[11:57] continue to grow. And if it continues to
[11:59] grow, the the asset itself, the utility
[12:02] of that asset will increasingly be um
[12:05] important both as collateral for stuff
[12:08] we want to do in uh in real life, in our
[12:11] lives, um as wealth for future
[12:15] generations, and also as a tool to stack
[12:18] more SATs. And that's the essence of
[12:19] that commercial real estate loan
[12:21] product. and and the thing that I'm
[12:22] thinking about with this um with this
[12:24] film finance product that I'm that I'm
[12:26] playing with right now, it it would be
[12:28] so interesting to see if there is
[12:31] because this is a part that that where
[12:34] real estate really shines. You have
[12:36] amazing possibilities to to get credits
[12:39] out and buy real estate for a little bit
[12:42] down payment and you get a 30-year loan.
[12:45] Imagine you could do the same thing with
[12:47] Bitcoin. take out a 30-year loan and buy
[12:50] like uh way more Bitcoin than you could
[12:53] ever buy. Like that that would be a no
[12:56] pray no brainer 100%.
[12:59] Well, and and the trick though is uh
[13:02] obviously to make payments against it,
[13:04] right? The magic of a mortgage, a home
[13:06] mortgage is that you break this pretty
[13:09] big this pretty big chunk into lots and
[13:11] lots of payments. Obviously, just to
[13:13] state the obvious. And so the risk I I I
[13:16] or the the danger I guess would be
[13:19] borrow a ton of fiat to buy Bitcoin. But
[13:22] then the trick is how do you make those
[13:24] payments? And if you have a way to make
[13:25] those payments that's locked in so that
[13:27] people aren't going to come in and take
[13:28] your Bitcoin, that is a trade worth
[13:30] making all day, every day. The the
[13:33] commercial real estate thing is
[13:34] interesting because it combines um in
[13:37] that case it combines rent coming in
[13:39] from tenants that services the loan but
[13:42] the loan itself includes the bitcoin
[13:44] that got bought at the beginning. So, so
[13:47] the Bitcoin is um is increasing in value
[13:51] while the loan itself is getting paid
[13:53] off. And at the end of the term, the
[13:55] borrower owns the Bitcoin and owns the
[13:57] property outright and the lender has
[14:00] been paid back in full plus interest,
[14:03] but also in this particular model that
[14:04] they put together has the appreciation
[14:06] on the Bitcoin. So it's a really elegant
[14:08] model to increase the stack for the
[14:12] lender to create a stack for the
[14:14] borrower and also create utility for
[14:16] that borrower. Their asset now can be
[14:19] refinanced again and you can rinse and
[14:21] repeat in ways that um are are
[14:24] accreative over time. Do do you think
[14:27] that will come also the the Bitcoin over
[14:29] time with with this borrowing against
[14:30] Bitcoin and and using Bitcoin as
[14:32] basically collateral and and then going
[14:35] ahead and using it as uh buying coffee
[14:38] with it? Buying coffee. Um that's a
[14:42] that's a really good question. I was
[14:43] thinking about that. I've been thinking
[14:45] about that a lot actually. you know, all
[14:46] the stories of the OG Bitcoiners, the
[14:49] whales who had literally hundreds of
[14:51] thousands of bitcoins, um, whether from
[14:53] mining or buying in at, you know, super
[14:56] early, um, where they're buying, you
[14:58] know, the classic one is the pizzas,
[15:00] obviously, um, or people buying houses
[15:03] or I heard a story today, it I think it
[15:06] was Natalie Brunell's podcast, um, she
[15:09] mentioned, I don't remember who it was
[15:10] she was referring to, but somebody
[15:12] really early on literally spent 180,000
[15:15] Bitcoin to buy a bunch of furniture for
[15:18] an for like the office that they were
[15:20] that they were building out for whatever
[15:21] his company was. And just the scope of
[15:23] that is staggering. Um I think that
[15:26] what's more likely is that the lightning
[15:29] network or things that are on the
[15:31] Bitcoin rails will be uh will be used
[15:34] for things like buying coffee. Um I
[15:37] think that's more likely. But I think
[15:39] even that where you're effectively using
[15:42] your Bitcoin to buy things, I think
[15:44] that's further out. I think as long as
[15:46] we're on a fiat standard, which I don't
[15:49] think is going to shift swiftly. I think
[15:52] it'll take some time. As long as we're
[15:54] on a fiat standard, it just makes more
[15:56] sense to mine fiat as it were and use
[15:59] that for that stuff and put your and and
[16:01] and buy Bitcoin and hold the Bitcoin. Um
[16:05] I think I think there'll be reasons to
[16:06] shift. And by the way, if you've talked
[16:08] to smart people that um that have a
[16:11] totally different take, I'm more than
[16:13] willing to listen. I, you know, I'm not
[16:14] an expert on this, but my guts from
[16:16] just, you know, living in the world
[16:18] right now, uh, says, you know, when I
[16:21] get a consulting, uh, payment in, I'm
[16:23] making a bunch of payments and socking
[16:25] some away in Bitcoin, and I'm not, then,
[16:28] you know, I don't I don't want to keep a
[16:29] ton in like a strike wallet just to go
[16:32] buy buy coffee. I like to do it when I'm
[16:34] talking to Bitcoiners. like there's
[16:36] there's something there's something sort
[16:37] of fun about using Bitcoin to interact
[16:41] with other Bitcoiners, but by and large,
[16:44] you know, going to the grocery store,
[16:45] going to uh the cafe, even going to
[16:48] dinner, I think I'd rather use the fiat
[16:50] because it's it's worth less than the do
[16:53] than the that amount of Bitcoin um
[16:56] that's sitting in a vault. Yeah, for for
[16:59] me, spending Bitcoin only makes sense if
[17:02] you are 100% already on Bitcoin. So if
[17:04] if if you're saying uh and and I I'm I'm
[17:08] almost quite there uh where I I get more
[17:13] and more paid actually in Bitcoin. So my
[17:15] uh the payments that I receive is more
[17:17] in Bitcoin than in fiat, but I still
[17:19] have fiat and I also pay now uh people
[17:21] in Bitcoin uh and uh in in fiat. So I
[17:25] have a fiat flow and a bitcoin flow. But
[17:28] the more and more I get into Bitcoin,
[17:30] the more and more I want to get to the
[17:32] point where I just have my Bitcoin
[17:34] wallet and I have maybe apps that are
[17:36] connected to that and I'm just 100%
[17:38] Bitcoin. And the interesting thing uh
[17:40] and the and the biggest thing probably
[17:42] that that happens there is it removes
[17:45] the emotional roller coaster of buying
[17:48] Bitcoin and trying to time the dip and
[17:51] then buy the dip or get for more when it
[17:54] runs up and stuff like that because I
[17:56] just like I just have 100% in Bitcoin
[17:59] and if it goes up or down it I I really
[18:01] don't care because if it goes down uh I
[18:05] it's like if it goes down I get more
[18:09] Bitcoin paid, but I also have to pay
[18:12] more Bitcoin. And if it goes up, I I get
[18:15] less Bitcoin paid, but I also have to
[18:17] pay less less Bitcoin. So, the emotional
[18:19] roller coaster around uh buying and
[18:22] selling Bitcoin, I haven't been to a
[18:24] Bitcoin exchange
[18:25] since four or five months now because uh
[18:29] the split between Bitcoin and fiat is so
[18:31] good. So, I didn't have to exchange one
[18:33] for another. uh which which is awesome,
[18:36] but uh it it's it's I I I realize I'm in
[18:40] a very special place and 99% of
[18:43] Bitcoiners probably aren't there yet.
[18:46] And uh it and and Bitcoin is in the
[18:49] store of value phase and the medium of
[18:51] exchange is far away, but it's important
[18:54] that we slowly get started with that, I
[18:56] guess. Well, I totally agree with you
[18:58] and actually that's a great point. it's
[19:00] a great addition to the to uh to that
[19:03] place. If if you're if you personally
[19:05] are on a Bitcoin standard and income is
[19:08] coming in in Bitcoin, then yeah, you're
[19:10] not you're not worried about the about
[19:12] the the arbitrage between those two at
[19:14] all. I'm still in this phase where most
[19:16] of the income is not coming from
[19:18] Bitcoiners who are paying in me in
[19:19] Bitcoin. Um I definitely have some
[19:21] sources and those are, you know, going
[19:23] straight in the vault. Um, but yeah, to
[19:26] the extent or until and unless I get to,
[19:29] you know, close to where you are, then
[19:31] yeah, you just have a fold card or or
[19:33] one of the apps that are is tied to
[19:35] some, you know, whichever part of your
[19:37] stack and then you just don't worry
[19:39] about it. you you need what you need and
[19:41] you you you buy what you need and you
[19:43] know you're you're thinking about I
[19:45] think I I think it'll I would well tell
[19:49] me if I'm wrong but I think when you
[19:50] since you're really close to being on on
[19:52] that fiat standard I bet it really
[19:54] impacts every time you buy something whe
[19:57] you know I would imagine that thinking
[19:59] do I really need this do I really want
[20:00] this is part of the thought process uh
[20:04] whether it's a latte or a new car or
[20:06] anything it's it's funny with me Because
[20:09] I I remember when I was a small kid, I
[20:12] actually was very saving. So when I got
[20:14] €5 as lunch money from my mom, I only
[20:18] spent €3 and already saved €2 because I
[20:21] was like, I can eat at home as much as I
[20:24] want and don't have to pay for it. I can
[20:25] keep the money. So I was always kind of
[20:27] a savings personality. But
[20:30] Bitcoin put it even more onto that. And
[20:34] maybe you can relate to that even more.
[20:36] uh since I have my company since one
[20:39] year now I'm doing it even more so so
[20:42] the company
[20:44] probably because if you're um uh if if
[20:48] the the moment I switched from being
[20:50] employed to being my own um company was
[20:54] a major switch for me because when you
[20:56] are an employee you have a salary coming
[21:00] each month no matter what like this just
[21:02] comes the the company pays you and
[21:05] there's even laws where they have to pay
[21:06] you three months even if they fire you.
[21:09] So, so, so you are pretty sure if you
[21:11] spend now, yeah, like next month there
[21:13] will come a paycheck. If you do your own
[21:16] business, there's no real guarantees.
[21:18] Yes, you have maybe contracts with with
[21:19] partners and stuff like that, but they
[21:22] are not long-term like this can go away
[21:24] and and and things can change. So, this
[21:27] actually probably impacted me even more
[21:30] than than Bitcoin itself. And you as an
[21:32] entrepreneur, I mean, you are on the on
[21:34] the back end. I I'm just getting
[21:36] started. So, you're on the back end of
[21:37] of of that. Uh you can probably relate
[21:41] to that a lot.
[21:43] 100%. Uh the first company that I
[21:45] started was just me and I bootstrapped
[21:47] it. I borrowed money from friends and
[21:49] family. Not a lot. Um you know, low low
[21:52] five figures and so I was very very
[21:56] aware that I was spending other people's
[21:58] money. Um I didn't pay myself. It was a
[22:00] side hustle when I started it. And yeah,
[22:03] 100% the your whole frame of reference
[22:06] around money
[22:08] um changes. I guess I guess it's I guess
[22:11] in theory you could sort of start from
[22:13] that place of I'm going to be a good
[22:14] steward of my family's money, of my of
[22:17] my own money, whatever. But I was very
[22:19] much not really motivated by the money
[22:23] that was associated with the with the
[22:25] businesses that I started. It was more
[22:26] about the problem that I was trying to
[22:29] solve. But yes, to your point, taking
[22:31] other people's money to allow that to
[22:34] happen made me really really um pay
[22:38] attention to every expenditure. Do I
[22:41] really need Well, I mean, it goes to an
[22:44] extreme, right? You know, do I really
[22:45] need to hire that person? this later,
[22:47] you know, that at other companies that
[22:49] I've worked with. Um, do we really need
[22:51] to hire a person or can we just figure
[22:53] out a way to um either get that done
[22:55] with the resources we have or make do
[22:57] without it or, you know, negotiating as
[23:00] hard a deal as you can with a vendor
[23:02] who's going to stand up a whatever a
[23:03] website or something. That was my first,
[23:05] you know, my first um goound. I hired
[23:08] developers to build the thing that I had
[23:10] in my head and negotiated as
[23:12] aggressively as I could and found the,
[23:14] you know, the least expensive high uh
[23:17] experienced developers that I could.
[23:18] This was back when that was not quite as
[23:20] easy as it is today. Um anyway, not not
[23:24] to sort of wool gather there, but yes,
[23:26] thinking about uh being a good steward
[23:29] of the capital is really really
[23:31] important. And that's true by the way
[23:33] whether you have a ton of capital just
[23:35] sitting there on the balance sheet not
[23:36] getting used or not. I'm really excited
[23:38] about people following maybe not the
[23:40] fullblown strategy strategy you know
[23:42] sailor strategy but the you know the
[23:45] more that corporate treasuries are
[23:47] allowed to hold Bitcoin and to the
[23:50] extent you have cash that is not getting
[23:52] utilized um I you know I you'd be
[23:55] hardressed not to store at least some of
[23:58] that treasury in Bitcoin. Like I think
[23:59] it's at some point it'll be obvious that
[24:01] it's irresponsible not to. It's so super
[24:05] interesting uh to think about that. Now
[24:07] the thinking is more like can can AI do
[24:10] this or do I have to hire someone?
[24:13] Yeah. Yeah. No, I mean that the AI
[24:16] revolution is definitely coming. I um I
[24:19] keep sort of dabbling around and mostly
[24:21] with um mostly with the LLMs, not around
[24:24] the co-pilots of of coding because again
[24:26] I'm not a coder. But um if the if if
[24:30] developers have a similar experience
[24:32] with the coding assistants that I am
[24:35] having with the chat assistants, I we're
[24:37] still we're still a ways away from that
[24:40] being where where you could effectively
[24:44] have an AI as an employee instead of an
[24:47] employee as the employee. I I I I'm not
[24:49] sure how far out that is, but like as a
[24:51] writer, I know that it's it's really
[24:53] dissatisfying to get the stuff back. I I
[24:56] it's not replacing me, let's put it that
[24:58] way. It can help me with the blank page.
[25:00] This is again specific to the to the uh
[25:03] to the to the writing style. And I would
[25:04] imagine that a developer who is very
[25:07] very skilled in the first place and is
[25:09] skilled with the AI tools could probably
[25:11] go faster and you know not do some of
[25:13] the grunt work, but you still have to
[25:15] rewrite everything and plug everything
[25:17] in the right way. Um so yes, it'll be
[25:20] nice when uh you know this idea of a one
[25:23] or two person billion dollar company.
[25:25] I'm really looking forward to that being
[25:26] a reality, but I don't think we're there
[25:28] in the next 12 months. Certainly. Yeah,
[25:31] it's it's right now AI is getting one
[25:35] person to from 100% efficiency to 150%
[25:39] efficiency. So that's how I look at it.
[25:42] And there will come a point where you
[25:44] can have EI agents that actually you can
[25:47] describe a task and they can do it
[25:49] themselves. They can log in things. They
[25:52] they they can browse around. they can
[25:54] operate Google Sheets. You can operate
[25:56] different things uh and you can actually
[25:58] do things. I'm really looking forward to
[26:01] to that because I'm already using AI as
[26:04] hard as I possibly can. I can I ask uh
[26:07] Chibly basically every day, oh, what can
[26:10] I do with AI on my work proc? Is there
[26:12] anything I can do? Like I I I want to
[26:14] really be hard on on AI and Bitcoin
[26:17] because those those are the the two big
[26:19] things right now. kind of as hard as
[26:22] possible on those ones. I think it will
[26:24] be really cool. But I wanted to ask you,
[26:28] how do you think Bitcoin will actually
[26:30] change the way businesses operate if if
[26:32] at all? Well, um how businesses operate.
[26:37] I
[26:37] think I think that as we as adoption
[26:43] becomes more and more common or even
[26:46] ubiquitous, as everybody starts to adopt
[26:49] it, I I think using again using Bitcoin
[26:53] as a tool to whether it's financing
[26:56] something or to just uh extend a runway.
[26:59] I can't I don't remember where I saw it,
[27:01] but I saw a model about uh probably a
[27:03] month or so ago where a startup that
[27:06] takes um it takes in say a million
[27:08] dollars from investors. Uh but that
[27:10] isn't you know they're not spend if
[27:12] you're at that level you're not spending
[27:13] a million dollar a month. Let's say
[27:14] you're spending $100,000 a month which
[27:17] actually is a little is quite a lot. If
[27:19] if you're taking in that million dollars
[27:21] and you buy and you store the bulk of it
[27:24] in Bitcoin and you spend it down,
[27:26] essentially what's happening you maybe
[27:29] not in one of those draw down years,
[27:30] you've got that problem. But let's
[27:31] assume that you're in you're in one of
[27:33] the you know 25% keer uh years. Um
[27:37] you're extending your runway. So instead
[27:40] of just 12 months of funding from the
[27:42] investor, you you now have whatever the
[27:45] math is, you've got another three or
[27:47] four months. So you're delaying um
[27:49] taking in additional capital and
[27:52] potentially never taking in more than
[27:54] one more round is sort of what that
[27:56] model sort of looked like. Anyway, to
[27:58] your question, how does how does how
[27:59] does it affect business? I think it's a
[28:01] tool for um helping grow faster, helping
[28:06] get to default alive faster. Um I think
[28:10] it it makes healthy companies stronger.
[28:14] Um, I don't I can't see a way that it
[28:16] would make a a unhealthy company weaker,
[28:19] I guess, unless you have people who
[28:21] don't know how to handle it. Um, but
[28:23] yeah, so I just think as a tool to help
[28:26] companies thrive and weather downturns,
[28:30] um, I think it's going to be really,
[28:31] really powerful. One thing I'm uh always
[28:33] looking at is is venture capital because
[28:36] I think there is if your default is USD
[28:40] and you uh have to spend that because
[28:43] you know it's going to melt away and all
[28:45] venture capitalist know like US dollar
[28:47] like it's it's going to be less in
[28:49] value. So they're trying to throw money
[28:51] at startups. So that might be where um
[28:56] we have less less foundings but maybe
[28:59] higher quality foundings because the
[29:01] hurdle rate of Bitcoin is higher than
[29:04] the hurdle rate of US dollar. So in that
[29:07] way it it could impact bad ideas but
[29:12] it's it's good it's good that we just
[29:15] throw money around it. It's good that we
[29:17] we look at is that the idea actually
[29:19] profitable? Can we make something
[29:21] happening in like 2 3 years? I mean
[29:23] obviously a startup doesn't need to be
[29:25] profitable day one. Uh but it should be
[29:28] profitable at some point. There should
[29:29] be a way to profitability. And uh if
[29:32] there isn't uh in in a fiat world it
[29:35] might still get funded and maybe die in
[29:37] two three years and there are millions
[29:39] of dollars lost. In a bitcoin world you
[29:42] you as a investor think twice or three
[29:45] times before you invest your hardearned
[29:47] bitcoin into into a company. I'm really
[29:50] looking forward to to that world without
[29:52] money printer. Yeah. Yeah. I think
[29:54] that's a really insightful point that
[29:56] the the with the hurdle rate that high
[29:58] because you you know that you know with
[30:00] with a I don't know if it's true of all
[30:03] limited partners into big venture funds.
[30:06] Um but they're just trying to get above
[30:08] what 10% 12%. If they could get above
[30:10] 12% that that venture capital firm is
[30:12] like blowing the doors off and the LPs
[30:14] are are super happy. But in a world
[30:17] where the hurdle rate is 20, 25, 30%
[30:20] because of the kegger of Bitcoin, it's
[30:22] actually kind of a double-edged sword,
[30:24] right? On the one hand, the idea has to
[30:26] be incredible and the potential has to
[30:29] be, you know, 10x in a really short
[30:31] period of time, but there aren't that
[30:33] many great ideas that are going to get
[30:34] there. And so you could you could you
[30:36] could you could make the argument that
[30:38] um at some level a bunch of good ideas
[30:41] that are worth doing don't find their
[30:43] sponsor because that hurdle rate is so
[30:46] high. I think practically speaking it
[30:48] would it would shake out differently
[30:49] where the really big checks still get
[30:52] written to the things that are already
[30:54] winning and you have the the seed and
[30:56] preede seed and angel step. um less
[31:00] concerned about, hey, I could have just
[31:02] bought Bitcoin and more let's figure out
[31:04] how to use Bitcoin as a tool to increase
[31:07] the likelihood that this company um you
[31:11] know achieves liftoff so to speak and
[31:14] and this problem I think Bitcoin
[31:16] companies already have because a Bitcoin
[31:18] company usually Bitcoiners invest and
[31:20] and they have to deliver hey like invest
[31:24] in me because I deliver something higher
[31:26] than than than Bitcoin. How can we how
[31:29] can we harness more Bitcoin companies?
[31:31] How can we kind of ma make that place a
[31:35] better place and in the Bitcoin company
[31:37] startup place? Well, I think we're still
[31:38] this is get gets back to your question
[31:40] about the parallels between Bitcoin and
[31:43] the internet itself. I think we're still
[31:45] in the picks and shovels stage where I
[31:47] mean the really early phase of the
[31:49] internet was laying down cable and
[31:52] having you know mo mobile cell towers
[31:54] everybody right the broadband capability
[31:56] that got built out in the 80s and '90s
[31:58] and into even into the 2000s maybe we're
[32:01] not quite at that early stage but that
[32:03] next phase of having the protocols get
[32:05] built and all of the interoper
[32:07] operability um getting built in so that
[32:10] you could start to actually build things
[32:12] that take advantage of
[32:14] um of you know high broadband and
[32:17] ubiquitous internet access that we've
[32:19] sort of been really enjoying for the
[32:20] last 10 or 15 years. I think we're not
[32:22] quite there yet. So to your question, I
[32:24] think Bitcoin companies are really still
[32:26] focused on infrastructure and laying
[32:29] down the the guard rails or the or the
[32:32] uh maybe not the guardrails, but
[32:33] basically the infrastructure so that you
[32:35] can build uh maybe not like the DGEN um
[32:40] like those old D apps stuff. Maybe we're
[32:42] not going back to full-blown web 3 land,
[32:44] at least in in in Bitcoin world. Um, but
[32:47] we still want to be able to build
[32:49] companies that are not just about
[32:51] transacting with each other. We want to
[32:53] build companies that um that have other
[32:56] purposes, but where Bitcoin is infused
[32:58] into it, whether it's part of the
[32:59] payments infrastructure or using a
[33:01] lightning um you know, using uh the L2
[33:05] and and the lightning network to
[33:07] interact with individuals within um a
[33:10] network. Um there's a bunch of different
[33:12] ways that you could use those techniques
[33:14] and those capabilities to um enhance
[33:17] what are technically Bitcoin companies
[33:19] that aren't just about, you know,
[33:22] borrowing and um and buying and
[33:25] transacting Bitcoin in and of itself.
[33:28] I'm excited about that. That's that's
[33:29] the phase that I want to see us get to
[33:31] soon. Yeah, I'm I'm so excit I do agree
[33:36] with you with with where we are
[33:37] currently. There's like there there are
[33:39] some people that say we are like 1990
[33:42] 1995 1998 where would you you draw that
[33:45] line but but but most people tell me we
[33:48] are in before 2000. How do you see that?
[33:51] Like if you had to overlay the internet
[33:54] adoption uh where we are right now with
[33:56] Bitcoin.
[33:58] Let's see. So I'll just think out loud.
[34:00] So I'm going to dox myself. I was around
[34:03] before the internet and then through the
[34:05] that early phase. So, um, so I we're
[34:08] definitely past the point where the
[34:11] where like the browser just gets, uh,
[34:13] gets introduced, right? Um I think
[34:17] we're maybe okay so there there's a
[34:20] couple of inflection points where
[34:22] highspeed internet access you know
[34:25] started to you know basically the
[34:27] penetration of highspeed internet access
[34:29] both for homes and for businesses
[34:31] happened I'm actually not a scholar of
[34:33] this but roughly 2000ish something like
[34:36] that it's like 5 years in may you know
[34:37] plus or minus a couple of years I think
[34:40] we're probably just now getting past
[34:42] that and I think maybe emblematic of
[34:44] that would the the the ETFs basically it
[34:47] gets adopted by institutions and now um
[34:51] the the likelihood that the whole thing
[34:54] sort of collapses under its own weight
[34:55] sort of goes away. And so if you sort of
[34:58] this is not a it's not a perfect analogy
[35:00] or parallel but once everybody has
[35:02] access to the internet and a a reliable
[35:05] stable access on a desktop then you can
[35:09] really do some interesting things. And
[35:10] then you know because you have an
[35:12] audience there you start to build uh you
[35:16] start to build things to do within that
[35:18] platform. The next phase again without
[35:22] sort of holding myself out as a scholar
[35:24] I think you could argue that the mobile
[35:25] phone and in particular the iPhone
[35:28] uh with the the you know that that
[35:30] harnessed the power of a mobile browser
[35:32] for the first time. I mean trying to get
[35:34] online in those early you know the
[35:36] Blackberry days before that was a huge
[35:38] pain in the ass. But the iPhone was a
[35:40] transformative device that opened up a
[35:43] ton of not just opportunity, but it made
[35:46] things possible that but that hadn't
[35:47] been possible before. And I think we're
[35:50] right on the cusp of that where I don't
[35:52] know how long it's going to be and I'm
[35:54] not exactly sure what it looks like, but
[35:56] I think that where the where the the
[35:59] ETFs and sort of the attendant other
[36:01] things that are happening, whether it's
[36:02] the strategic Bitcoin reserve or the the
[36:04] stuff that is making it here to stay is
[36:07] going to make people emboldened and
[36:09] empowered to start to build the stuff on
[36:13] top of that that we'll start to see in,
[36:16] you know, in the coming in the coming
[36:17] years. Let's take a break for a moment
[36:19] and appreciate the beauty that Coin
[36:22] Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[36:25] watches. Those watches are the most
[36:27] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[36:30] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[36:34] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[36:36] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[36:40] watch collections. You have the date of
[36:42] the first ever mined Bitcoin block in
[36:45] there and of course also the block
[36:47] height and which epoch we are currently
[36:51] in. I love the level of detail they put
[36:54] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[36:56] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[36:59] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[37:02] love those watches so so much. And now
[37:05] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[37:07] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[37:09] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[37:11] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[37:13] first way is you put it on a hardware
[37:16] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[37:19] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[37:22] BitBox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[37:25] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[37:28] if you check out the link in the
[37:29] description, you even get 5% off if you
[37:32] use the code Robin. And the second way
[37:35] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[37:38] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[37:41] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[37:44] They will personalize for you a
[37:46] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[37:49] your individual situation. They will
[37:52] show you how you can secure your own
[37:54] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[37:57] enough. You also have to keep all your
[37:59] devices secure. One topic that is
[38:01] overlooked often is the inheritance
[38:03] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[38:06] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[38:09] a plan for that in place already? And
[38:12] last but not least, if you're in a
[38:13] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[38:16] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[38:18] that, head over to the
[38:22] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[38:25] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[38:28] be for the first time ever speaking at
[38:30] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[38:33] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[38:36] really looking forward to seeing all of
[38:38] you there. You can get your ticket in
[38:40] the link down in the description of
[38:42] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[38:45] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[38:48] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[38:50] there. It's really a fun place to be
[38:52] right now because we have all the things
[38:55] in place. We have the ETFs, we have the
[38:57] strategic Bitcoin reserve flow. Like all
[38:59] the game theory things that we have
[39:01] hoped for the last 16 years that
[39:04] companies buy, high net worth
[39:06] individuals buy, uh countries buy, the
[39:09] the big ETFs are here. All of that we
[39:13] now have. And so now we just kind of
[39:16] wait and see how fast the those buckets
[39:21] will will fill. It's it's a point in
[39:23] time Bitcoin in 205 where it's so
[39:27] obvious if you educate yourself and
[39:31] still so many people don't get it. So if
[39:33] you look back at like 2012, it was not
[39:37] obvious. We we haven't gone through
[39:39] block size wars. There's not an ETF out.
[39:41] There's like the president is not
[39:42] talking about it. like 2012 it was way
[39:46] more a gamble because there was a lot of
[39:49] questions still in in the room that just
[39:51] wasn't weren't answered. Now we got 90%
[39:55] of all question kind of answered and uh
[39:59] still 97 98% whatever the number is of
[40:03] people have no clue about Bitcoin. Even
[40:06] a lot of Bitcoiners who hold like $1,000
[40:09] on on on Coinbase, they still have no
[40:11] clue. If if you only have $1,000 on
[40:13] Coinbase that you don't have a clue
[40:15] about Bitcoin. That's right. Yeah. I
[40:18] mean, I think the you know, we're still
[40:20] in a mode right now where, you know, on
[40:22] Bitcoin X like that in spaces and and on
[40:25] X, there's a ton of um let's call it
[40:29] noise about how few whole coiners there
[40:33] will ever be, right? There's only going
[40:34] to there's only 21 million coins. That
[40:36] literally means that there can only be
[40:38] 21 million theoretical whole coiners and
[40:41] it's way smaller than that obviously. Um
[40:44] and aren't we awesome for having a whole
[40:46] coin? Those people who do. Um I'm
[40:49] looking forward to getting on the other
[40:51] side of that discourse. It can't happen
[40:53] until what you just described goes away
[40:56] where most people don't even get it or I
[40:59] you know there's there's people who
[41:00] never heard of it and there's people who
[41:02] don't understand why it's important and
[41:04] don't get it even in the context of
[41:06] that. I think we do have to continue to
[41:09] educate and get and bring people along
[41:11] and and let them know why Bitcoin is
[41:14] special. Well, thing that popped in my
[41:16] head of two things to say. Um, one thing
[41:18] that popped in my head as you were
[41:19] talking a moment ago
[41:20] was, you know, appropo of the the how
[41:23] long we've come over those past 12
[41:25] years. I think we had to go through the
[41:28] shitcoin era, the pump and dump era. I
[41:30] don't think I think it was inevitable
[41:33] that those altcoins, those shitcoins
[41:36] would come up and pump and dumps would
[41:38] happen, rugs would happen, people would
[41:39] [ __ ] around with ordinals and NFTts and
[41:42] what have you. Uh, and you know, no
[41:44] judgment, it's just not my thing. For
[41:46] all of the reasons that we have seen
[41:48] over the past four or five years, they
[41:49] are not Bitcoin. There is no second
[41:51] best. Bitcoin is money. Those things are
[41:54] not money. Bitcoin is decentralized.
[41:57] None of those other things are
[41:59] decentralized. And on and on and on. And
[42:01] I think as those go from being mantras
[42:05] and slogans to being principles that
[42:08] everybody basically understands, then we
[42:11] can get to the other side of it and the
[42:13] people who 5 years from now will be
[42:16] hearing about Bitcoin for the first time
[42:17] and get educated. They're not going to
[42:19] be able to buy a whole coin. But it's
[42:21] not going to matter because pick one
[42:24] coin is going to be worth so much that
[42:26] even if you have a tenth of a coin if
[42:28] you have, you know, pick a number half a
[42:31] million sats, that's going to be a
[42:33] really meaningful thing for you and your
[42:35] family going forward. You just won't
[42:37] have taken advantage of the early days,
[42:40] certainly the early early days, let
[42:41] alone the
[42:42] 2024, five, six era. It's a super
[42:46] interesting conversation when we think
[42:48] about how how people actually get get
[42:51] adopted like how uh no not get adopted
[42:54] but how people actually adopt Bitcoin.
[42:57] So when we look at I don't know the car
[43:01] most people don't really understand how
[43:03] a car works and and what the engine is
[43:06] looking like. Most people know how to
[43:08] drive a car but not how the car actually
[43:11] works. Same with the internet. Most
[43:13] people can send WhatsApp messages, can
[43:16] post on Instagram and do a video call
[43:20] like most people in the internet can do
[43:22] that. But how many people can actually
[43:25] describe what's underneath with the CCP
[43:28] network with all all those things? And
[43:31] I'm wondering often how many people do
[43:35] do pe how many people really need to
[43:38] understand Bitcoin in order for it to
[43:42] work? Maybe 80 90 95% of people just
[43:47] have an app on their phone where they
[43:49] send money and they know like all this
[43:51] Bitcoin thing is is superior. They don't
[43:54] really know why. They they just they
[43:57] just know how to use it. and and that
[43:59] the same way people know, yeah, it's
[44:01] it's it's more efficient to drive a car
[44:04] than ride a horse, they don't have to
[44:06] explain why, it's just so much better.
[44:09] So, I I'm I'm wondering how how long
[44:13] this podcast even needs to be there
[44:16] before we hit a mass adoption where most
[44:19] people actually already get Bitcoin
[44:22] without really understanding the
[44:24] revolution behind it. I'm I'm I'm really
[44:27] curious. uh h how do how do you think
[44:29] about that? Yeah. Well, I definitely
[44:31] think that it like so many inventions uh
[44:34] or discoveries before whether it's
[44:36] electricity itself and then leading to
[44:38] the you know the electrical grid in the
[44:41] United States or to use your car example
[44:43] the first couple of cars you know there
[44:45] was you couldn't really go anywhere
[44:46] because the roads were full of horses
[44:48] right you literally didn't want to scare
[44:50] the horses um but then at some point you
[44:53] have the international highways in the
[44:54] United States and you know 65 70 mph um
[44:58] speed limits and nobody Nobody would
[45:00] even. Anyway, the point is it becomes
[45:03] adopted and at some point nobody even
[45:06] thinks about it. It just is. And I I
[45:08] don't know how long it'll take. Um but I
[45:11] don't think we're that far away. I think
[45:14] if you think about how complex if you
[45:17] just think about starting with the white
[45:18] paper itself and then what had to happen
[45:21] for us to get to where we are in 2025
[45:24] with all of the sort of milestones along
[45:26] the way. What's kind of I was thinking
[45:28] about this today as I was thinking about
[45:30] um chatting with you just how remarkable
[45:33] it is from the from when the when the
[45:36] white paper gets published to even just
[45:39] four years later. I mean the price of
[45:41] Bitcoin I I'm I'm not a scholar of it
[45:43] you but it stays relatively flat for a
[45:45] long time but four years later it was
[45:47] still going. And I'm I'm curious again I
[45:50] mean I'd like to see a history of this
[45:51] like where did those nodes pop up and
[45:54] how did uh whoever Satoshi was
[45:57] interacting with how did that group
[45:59] start to spread the word in a way that
[46:01] made people get interested even just
[46:03] interested to to you know to plug in a
[46:07] minor right like that process is really
[46:09] interesting but and now to come back to
[46:11] your point most people like you said 90
[46:15] 95 99% at of people at some point will
[46:19] just know that there's this thing that
[46:21] happens called mining and that more than
[46:24] 98% of all the Bitcoin that's ever going
[46:27] to uh exist has been mined already and
[46:31] now we're just using the Bitcoin and the
[46:33] miners are doing something something to
[46:35] make us secure and we can trust it. Most
[46:38] people are just aren't they're just
[46:39] going to accept it for what it is. um
[46:42] you know I and there's basically you
[46:45] just take it for granted not unlike
[46:47] taking the just back to the internet now
[46:49] we I certainly take it for granted
[46:51] unless and until I'm disconnected from
[46:54] it when at a time when I don't want to
[46:55] be disconnected from it whether it's on
[46:57] a plane or the damn cable modem goes out
[47:00] in the house um you know seems like you
[47:04] walk around like you just woke up from a
[47:06] nap or something for a bit and it's fine
[47:09] but my point is you just take it so for
[47:11] granted that it's always there. And I
[47:13] think we will definitely get to the
[47:15] point where not just Bitcoin itself is
[47:17] that, but how we use it and how it gets
[47:20] infused and and strengthens the
[47:23] financial system that we've are
[47:25] beholdened to now. Yeah. It's so funny
[47:27] when when you're all of the sudden
[47:29] somewhere and there's no internet or
[47:31] there's no electricity and all of the
[47:32] sudden you you're like, "What am I
[47:35] doing?" Like I I cannot look up on the
[47:38] internet what I should do now.
[47:41] No, exactly. Well, actually appropo of
[47:43] that, um, uh, I live in Los Angeles and
[47:46] we had a couple of really terrible fires
[47:48] a couple of months ago as we're as we're
[47:50] recording this. Um, and my house w is in
[47:53] a is not was not directly affected by
[47:56] one of the fires, but I was a couple of
[47:58] sort of areas over and we got evacuated,
[48:01] but it wasn't until like 12 hours later,
[48:04] but our power went out about 4 hours
[48:08] before the fire that was close to me
[48:10] started. And so my my uh my phone
[48:14] worked, but the entire house was dark
[48:16] and it was like dusk. So, the point is
[48:19] that I I I knew that a fire was
[48:22] happening because a couple of people
[48:23] called me and I even drove up to a hill
[48:26] and I could see it, but it was far away.
[48:28] I'm like, "Okay, well, I'm just going to
[48:29] go to bed. It's no big deal." And then I
[48:32] got a call from a friend at like 5:00 in
[48:34] the morning saying, "Your neighborhood
[48:36] is getting evacuated." And the point is
[48:38] not, you know, how scary that was,
[48:40] although it was, but yes, we we get so
[48:43] uh we we just take for granted the fact
[48:45] that, you know, we can just hop online
[48:46] or turn on the TV um or literally have
[48:51] lights on as I'm putting clothes and
[48:53] stuff in a bag to to, you know, bug out.
[48:56] Um yeah, I'm not a prepper, but that was
[49:00] as close to wanting to be a prepper as
[49:02] I've been. uh having a go bag and making
[49:05] sure that um I've got my I've got my
[49:08] cold wallets uh available and taking
[49:11] with me um was was kind of an
[49:13] interesting little experience experience
[49:15] for about half an hour that morning.
[49:17] It's it's super interesting because it's
[49:19] like you you
[49:21] you want to prep for those things, but
[49:24] usually you need one one big thing that
[49:27] happened to actually remind you how
[49:31] important this prep. Mo most people will
[49:34] not change if there's not like some some
[49:36] pain coming or something coming their
[49:38] way. Now all of a sudden they're like,
[49:40] "Oh, like I I should prep for that.
[49:43] Maybe it's a good good idea to to do
[49:45] that." And yeah, it's the same way with
[49:47] self- custody. Um, and you with the
[49:49] Bitcoin advisory, so so you're well
[49:51] aware of how how how few people actually
[49:54] do self custody and and and how people
[49:57] are scaring away from, oh, I don't I
[49:59] don't want to do self custody. H it's
[50:02] it's so it's it's so it's so so
[50:04] interesting. Do you think of custody is
[50:06] something that can or or will be will be
[50:11] mainstream? If we think about the car uh
[50:14] example, will there will there be is the
[50:18] car self custody or is it like oh like
[50:22] no people will not self custody and and
[50:25] the mechanic will do the work and stuff
[50:26] like that. Like how do you think about I
[50:29] mean maybe a better example is email
[50:31] servers in the early days of the
[50:32] internet. I hear from from from from pe
[50:36] from people that tell me about it
[50:37] because I was not I was just like a few
[50:40] years old. Um people thought everyone
[50:43] will run their own email servers and now
[50:45] everything is on on Google servers and
[50:48] and Apple servers and stuff like that.
[50:51] Do do you think self custody is like a
[50:52] wet dream of of Bitcoiners and then it
[50:55] will be like only a small amount of
[50:57] people that actually do it or is is
[50:58] there is that something that will be
[51:00] mainstream?
[51:01] Well, okay. Okay. So, first of all, I
[51:03] haven't thought about this question
[51:04] before, but I I think it's a terrific
[51:07] question and because it it is does touch
[51:09] on a couple of things that I have
[51:10] thought about lately. And so, just to
[51:12] start with the fire example, I wasn't
[51:15] worried about leaving my
[51:18] um my treasure or my ledger. I none of
[51:21] my keys, right? My my
[51:22] my cold wallets. I didn't worry about
[51:25] taking them with me because I have a I'm
[51:27] with the Bitcoin adviser and my stuff is
[51:29] in a vault and I wasn't worried about
[51:31] the house burning down in the first
[51:32] place. But if it did, my Bitcoin is fine
[51:35] because the uh you know I have I have a
[51:38] Thea vault and I also have an Unchained
[51:40] vault. Um and then the Bitcoin advisor
[51:42] has a key. So if I need to you know get
[51:45] I just go buy another treasure, another
[51:47] ledger or whatever and you know swap out
[51:50] the key. It's literally not a problem.
[51:53] And to build on that and getting back to
[51:54] what you were saying a second ago, um,
[51:56] yeah, when you first have a car, you
[51:58] feel like you have to be you have to be
[52:00] able to maintain the car yourself. That
[52:02] was when I was growing up, that was a
[52:03] pretty common thing, especially among
[52:06] dads and sons. You know, the idea of
[52:09] getting in, you know, under the hood and
[52:11] whether it's changing the oil or any of
[52:14] the other stuff that one does as a as a
[52:16] gear head. Um, that was really
[52:19] ubiquitous. But I don't know about you,
[52:21] but the I I wouldn't know where what to
[52:24] do if I had to change a carburetor or or
[52:28] even change the oil on the car that I
[52:30] drive. It's a it's a nice German car. I
[52:32] can put oil in and I can, you know, top
[52:34] up some fluids, but I'm like I'm going
[52:37] to a specialist to deal with it. And so
[52:39] to come back to Bitcoin, um, one of the
[52:41] things that I've been thinking about
[52:42] alongside all of this, actually one more
[52:44] anecdote, uh, associated with the
[52:47] fires, there were stories in the couple
[52:49] of weeks in both of those big fires in
[52:52] LA of, um, of basically robbers going
[52:56] around to the places where the houses
[52:58] had burned down and taking the safes
[53:02] that were in the houses under the
[53:04] assumption that there's valuables in
[53:05] there. And if you're a Bitcoiner, of
[53:08] course, you've got your your cphrase in
[53:11] there in some form,
[53:12] right? Um, essentially, you have to be
[53:15] your own bank if you're going to
[53:16] self-custody. And a lot of Bitcoiners
[53:19] think that's the only way to be, and
[53:20] more power to them. But I also know that
[53:24] I didn't have a single worry about
[53:27] having access to my Bitcoin when I left
[53:29] my house that day. I actually did come
[53:31] back in and grab it just in case the um
[53:33] you know my my two keys, but I wouldn't
[53:36] have had to. And then if the if the
[53:37] house had burned down, that would have
[53:38] been the least of my worries. I'd you
[53:40] know, call Peter or Andy at the Bitcoin
[53:42] Advisor and have them, you know, spin me
[53:44] up another, you know, I'd tell them, you
[53:45] know, get a new key and I'm ready to
[53:47] swap it out. It's no problem at all. And
[53:49] the Bitcoin adviser isn't the only
[53:51] service that does that, but it allows
[53:52] you to be your own bank, but without all
[53:55] of the attendant security problems where
[53:57] you've got to have, you know, the
[54:00] metaphorical guard strapped with, you
[54:03] know, with a Glock ready to take out the
[54:05] people who are coming to steal your
[54:06] Bitcoin. That is no longer a problem,
[54:08] let alone with time locking uh options
[54:11] and other things that are in the same
[54:13] category of things that keep you from
[54:15] being a single point of failure. So I
[54:17] definitely think that that is going to
[54:18] be more and more common whether it's
[54:20] with a key agent or with time locking or
[54:24] other techniques that people have
[54:25] developed for sure. Yeah. Self cast
[54:28] multi signature is um a gamecher for for
[54:32] for Bitcoin. Without that it would be
[54:36] such a hustle if you only have one key.
[54:38] How do you protect it? And if someone
[54:41] comes to your house, especially as
[54:43] someone that is known uh to to have
[54:45] Bitcoin, uh you don't want to be in a
[54:47] situation where you can even access
[54:49] those Bitcoin right there and then you
[54:52] you want to have you have some you want
[54:54] to have some layers of security of how
[54:56] hard it is. So So how I I I do it, it's
[55:00] like there are different strategies. You
[55:02] have to have like a world where maybe
[55:05] most of it is and there is like it's
[55:08] really hard to get to it. It's like you
[55:10] you you
[55:11] you really want to get in a position
[55:14] where you maybe even want to have it so
[55:17] locked away that you have to spend time
[55:20] and miles to really get to that. And
[55:23] then there's like a world where you can
[55:24] easily get to that because I have to pay
[55:26] Bitcoin. It's it's it's literally a very
[55:29] easily accessible world for me. Um but
[55:32] there's not a lot on there. It's just
[55:34] like working capital where like it goes
[55:36] around. Uh so it's super interesting um
[55:40] to to think about how how this will be
[55:43] adopted or and and now uh to to the to
[55:46] the to the question it's I I think it
[55:48] will be I I have a high hopes that
[55:51] Bitcoin self custody will be adopted. I
[55:54] have I have high hopes for it to be
[55:56] really mainstream adopted. Like when
[55:58] when we think about what what happens
[56:00] when Apple and and and Google discover
[56:03] Bitcoin and self-custody, they will
[56:05] develop amazing apps. Uh and and I
[56:08] always bring that example um up as as
[56:11] Sailor also brought it up in my podcast
[56:12] actually and I stole it from him. What
[56:14] happens if Apple actually encounters
[56:16] Bitcoin and self-custody? They want to
[56:18] have Bitcoin on their devices. So they
[56:22] develop the iPhones according to Bitcoin
[56:25] and they will make sure you can sign
[56:28] transactions when you hold I don't know
[56:30] your iPhone with your Apple Watch
[56:32] together and maybe if you want to be
[56:34] secure iPhone, Apple Watch and MacBook
[56:36] and if you hold those three things
[56:38] together and you sign with them on the
[56:40] same time then you can move your Bitcoin
[56:42] and they can u make basically a multi-
[56:45] signature with Bitcoin. They probably do
[56:47] multi- signature then with everything
[56:49] and and stuff like that. Uh maybe you
[56:51] can then sign in in your Google account
[56:53] with a Apple multi- signature. Just just
[56:57] thinking out loud now. But I I I think
[57:00] key management and that's my most
[57:02] optimistic thing. Key management will be
[57:05] something very easy and the same thing
[57:09] that is now with username and password
[57:11] basically. So uh I don't I don't know
[57:13] how how much you agree with that but
[57:15] that's how I hope it will be. Definitely
[57:18] agree with that. I mean I think the we
[57:21] have the fiat version of that now uh and
[57:23] not everybody uses it. Some people are
[57:25] don't trust Apple for example to uh to
[57:28] be secure or maybe it's not Apple so
[57:31] much but the actual device they worry
[57:33] about. My I'm not like I'm not an
[57:36] engineer so I could can't tell you
[57:38] exactly how the um that secure enclave
[57:41] inside the Apple devices works but I
[57:43] believe that it does work. I I believe
[57:45] it exists that it does work and that you
[57:47] can't no one can access it other than
[57:49] you via the tools that are built into
[57:52] the device. So my point is only that um
[57:55] well just to to connect the one dot that
[57:57] I haven't talked about. So I already pay
[58:00] my credit cards uh you know with through
[58:02] the apps on my phone. I have access to
[58:04] my bank account. I can I actually did a
[58:06] wire within the bank's app for the first
[58:09] time a week or so ago. um and it's
[58:12] capped out at a certain amount, but I
[58:14] that was something you used to have to
[58:15] go into the bank to do. So, we're
[58:17] already we're already in a mode of
[58:19] trusting our devices and having um let's
[58:22] call it multiffactor authentication
[58:25] whether it's your face or your thumb
[58:27] depending on your device or two-factor
[58:29] literally where you know you log in with
[58:31] your username and password and it you
[58:33] have to double check in a different app
[58:34] like those are ways to create friction
[58:36] and keep um keep a wrench attack from
[58:39] happening. you know, there are ways
[58:41] around that. Um, and to what you were
[58:44] saying a moment ago, creating literally
[58:47] some physical distance between keys so
[58:49] that, you know, it's one thing for
[58:50] somebody to steal your phone, you know,
[58:53] put a gun to your head and hold it to
[58:55] your face and then spend money out of
[58:57] some app, whether it's a fold app or
[58:59] literally your bank account, whatever,
[59:01] whatever it might be, right? That's one
[59:03] thing. But if you've got your your stack
[59:06] in a vault that requires multiple keys
[59:08] and you have to go whether it's you know
[59:11] um the Bitcoin adviser has to approve a
[59:14] transaction. By the way, there's a bunch
[59:15] of different ways to do this. You don't
[59:16] have to have your whole stack, you know,
[59:18] get approved. But the smart play with
[59:20] the bigger your stack or let's say the
[59:22] the more valuable your stack, the wiser
[59:25] it is to have the bulk of it basically
[59:28] sitting unavailable without some third
[59:31] party approving a transaction. And
[59:33] literally part of the part of the you
[59:36] know the protocol that we've set up with
[59:38] the Bitcoin advisor includes are you
[59:40] currently under duress and uh you know
[59:44] that's an important going to be an
[59:45] increasingly important thing. So anyway,
[59:47] back to what you were saying, having
[59:49] physic, whether you have a key agent or
[59:51] you just have separated your keys,
[59:52] having a small bit that is semi
[59:55] vulnerable to some, you know, some dude
[59:58] on the street, but most of it
[60:01] unavailable except if you go through,
[60:03] you jump through some hoops to get
[60:05] through. I think that will be
[60:07] increasingly common. And I think that'll
[60:09] be the like how would you who why who
[60:11] who if you've got a bunch of Bitcoin,
[60:13] why would you do it any other way is is
[60:14] the way I think most people will will
[60:16] think about it. And then back to what
[60:18] you were saying about the devices, maybe
[60:19] there's like you said, maybe there's
[60:21] multiple devices and you make it easy on
[60:24] yourself, but then you know, you still
[60:26] have that wrench attack problem. And I
[60:28] do believe that um you know, it's a it's
[60:31] a rough and tumble world out there. You
[60:33] got to keep that in mind as a thing to
[60:35] worry about as well. Absolutely. it it's
[60:38] it's really rare,
[60:41] but it's a rough world. So, keep in mind
[60:45] that it's a possibility, especially if
[60:47] Bitcoin becomes more popular, especially
[60:49] as Bitcom becomes if Bitcoin goes from
[60:52] what is it 93,000 or something like that
[60:54] today to uh let let's say it goes to
[60:58] 200,000 to 2 million to 20 million. And
[61:02] it's known that you have been in in
[61:04] Bitcoin since I don't know 10,000 2,000.
[61:06] Yeah, they just assume like, oh, you
[61:09] probably have a bunch of Bitcoin. Maybe
[61:11] it's not true because you made some
[61:13] mistakes along the way. Like there are a
[61:15] lot of OGs that have been in in since
[61:18] 2017, 2020 and and have made so many
[61:22] mistakes along the way with selling
[61:24] Bitcoin or losing Bitcoin or like trying
[61:28] fancy products with Bitcoin uh and and
[61:30] and getting burned and stuff like that.
[61:32] So they they might actually have not a
[61:35] very big stack, a very small stack
[61:38] actually. But even if that's the case,
[61:41] you still maybe get robbed because
[61:44] people assume that you have a lot of
[61:45] Bitcoin. So so so getting getting used
[61:50] to that. And I think there's also
[61:52] something interesting. If every
[61:54] Bitcoiner is really good on their
[61:57] security and people just know like, oh,
[62:00] like I will go there and break that in
[62:02] and I can even get Bitcoin because it's
[62:05] literally literally not possible. I
[62:07] would I would give it to you if I could,
[62:09] but it's not possible to give you any
[62:11] Bitcoin. I'll give you this key, but
[62:14] it's not worth anything to you, right?
[62:16] Like that's the conversation. and you
[62:19] know like there's nothing you can do and
[62:22] the minute they leave you're like hey
[62:24] Peter will you swap out my my key I just
[62:26] got rent attacked or whatever right
[62:28] whether it's a person that helps you or
[62:30] or what there's a bunch of different
[62:32] ways but I think you're right and I was
[62:34] thinking about this earlier as we were
[62:35] talking yeah whether you have a tenth of
[62:38] a of a coin or a whole coin or you're a
[62:40] whale with thousands of coins um it's
[62:44] going to be
[62:45] increasingly incumbent on you to secure
[62:48] cure your Bitcoin in the perfect way.
[62:50] And perfect will always sort of evolve a
[62:52] little bit, but it's no longer what's
[62:54] the Winklevoss thing. They they had
[62:56] their seed phrases on a piece of paper
[62:58] or something and tore it into, you know,
[63:00] different chunks and put the chunks in
[63:02] different banks or something like that.
[63:04] Um, you know, that's a little baroque
[63:06] now. You don't need to do that. You have
[63:07] a couple of devices. You have multi you
[63:10] have a multi-IG vault. You keep the you
[63:14] have copies of the keys and you store
[63:16] them in different places and you know
[63:18] that's the basics. There's other things
[63:20] one should do but that's the basics and
[63:22] that's sufficient for most people and
[63:24] worth doing. Yeah with the WLES we could
[63:27] even make a a movie out of it. There are
[63:29] so many movies where they have to break
[63:31] in different things and collect the
[63:33] pieces to to get to the treasure. I
[63:35] think I think Bitcoin will be
[63:38] implemented in a lot of movies, in lot
[63:41] of things like that because it just is
[63:44] such a unique asset and it it can be
[63:48] really nicely it it can fit really
[63:50] nicely in a story if there's some
[63:53] robbery going on and you know there's
[63:55] some really famous and rich guy that has
[63:58] his Bitcoin distributed over 12
[64:01] different banks and in each bank there's
[64:03] like one word or something like that or
[64:05] the two words uh and then you have to
[64:07] break in all in all those banks to get
[64:09] it like you can have I I think Bitcoin
[64:13] isn't there's like if you zoom back 5 10
[64:16] years Bitcoin isn't a lot in movies or
[64:19] series now actually if you watch TV all
[64:22] day long which I don't recommend but uh
[64:24] there's there's Bitcoin the word coming
[64:27] in almost every day no matter what you
[64:30] watch all the the big serieses have
[64:32] Bitcoin in at some point. I think this
[64:35] Bitcoin will become more and more more
[64:36] of a of a story. That's that's also
[64:38] something uh you're also coming from
[64:40] from from that industry, right? Yeah.
[64:43] The entertainment business. Yes. Yeah.
[64:45] And you know, without sort of belaboring
[64:48] it, I I I've had a bunch of different
[64:50] touch points in the entertainment
[64:51] business. I started off as an assistant
[64:53] at one of the big talent agencies. I
[64:55] represented screenwriters and was really
[64:57] sort of oriented around story and good
[64:59] writing and how the television business
[65:01] itself works. And then I had another
[65:03] stint several years. I left the business
[65:04] and then came back and then I
[65:06] represented feature screenwriters, movie
[65:08] screenwriters and uh as a manager. That
[65:11] job is very much uh very much about um
[65:14] interacting about the creative. And so I
[65:16] sort of got my got my fingers really
[65:18] dirty so to speak um with draft after
[65:22] draft with a bunch of my clients. Um and
[65:25] then one other touch point that has to
[65:26] do with story was one of the companies
[65:28] that I co-founded um the whole point of
[65:31] the company was to um was to basically
[65:36] assess screenplays to give analysis of
[65:39] what's working and what's not and there
[65:40] was a scoring system is the company's
[65:42] still around um there's a scoring system
[65:45] and you know the higher you are on the
[65:47] score the the better the script is. It's
[65:49] literally a quality measure. And to get
[65:52] back to your point, yes, I've read
[65:54] literally thousands of scripts, maybe
[65:56] tens of thousands over a long period of
[65:58] time. I'm I'm not that young. Um, and
[66:01] so, yeah, the hallmarks of storytelling
[66:03] are are really important. And I'm sure
[66:06] that increasingly, um, Bitcoin either as
[66:09] the the thing that everybody's after or
[66:14] just as part of a plot is are going to
[66:16] be more and more ubiquitous. it'll just
[66:18] be part of the way we think about money
[66:20] at some point. So rather than I what was
[66:23] it? I think it was Die Hard 3 where they
[66:26] were robbing uh the the Federal Reserve
[66:29] in New York of all of their gold uh
[66:31] because there's more gold there than
[66:33] Fort Knox I think was the was sort of
[66:35] the thesis there. You don't need to do
[66:37] that anymore. Like the you know yeah
[66:38] that's a lot of gold. It's worth a lot,
[66:40] but you know, if you can just, you know,
[66:42] figure out how to get somebody to give
[66:44] you their seat raises and transfer it
[66:46] over to um, you know, transfer it out of
[66:49] their wallet, you're, you know, you're
[66:51] off to the races.
[66:53] Easier said than done, though. Like,
[66:54] it's easy, you know, there like I've
[66:56] thought a little bit about this. Sorry
[66:57] to interrupt you, but just to finish
[66:59] that thought. It's easier said than done
[67:00] to take somebody's Bitcoin, right?
[67:02] You're transferring it from one wallet
[67:04] to the next. it's on the chain like
[67:06] you're going to it's going to get seen
[67:08] and getting it into a way where you can
[67:11] literally, you know, ride off into the
[67:12] sunset is easier said than done. Yeah,
[67:15] that the the buy bit story is is is is
[67:19] fun right now because they have what
[67:20] like 1.2 two billion uh dollars that
[67:24] they stole. And I just talked with
[67:26] someone that follows that story very
[67:28] closely that analyzes it and he's kind
[67:30] of detective in in in that regard
[67:32] because he he's done it with with
[67:35] smaller uh things and he has uh over the
[67:38] years uh recuperate millions of dollars
[67:40] uh from from Bitcoin thieves basically.
[67:44] And he we went deep on in that story and
[67:47] he said like maybe a$100 or $200 million
[67:51] they have now kind of secured of like
[67:54] getting away but they're working every
[67:56] day and they're only taking 10-minut
[67:59] break. So every day they're working
[68:00] three shifts just to wash out the
[68:03] bitcoin and get it undisclosed. Uh and
[68:07] by bit happened u some time ago already.
[68:11] uh and just just that like 10% of of the
[68:14] whole thing. So it is a lot of work to
[68:16] get that money in different places in
[68:19] like thousands of different addresses.
[68:21] So you cannot do it and then coin join
[68:23] it and then do all those those things.
[68:25] It's it's a it's a whole whole
[68:28] profession to to do that. So most of the
[68:32] e ones they they they get they get uh
[68:35] because they have done some touch point
[68:37] and all of the sudden they can connect
[68:39] the the address to an actual person and
[68:42] then you just go to the police, you show
[68:44] them the evidence, they get them to
[68:45] court, they transfer the money back. So
[68:48] it it's it's not that easy to just steal
[68:53] Bitcoin. You you really have to have
[68:55] skill also now. Yeah. Well, and
[68:58] specifically to get away with it, right?
[68:59] Like it's one thing to steal it like you
[69:01] just talked about it but you know the
[69:03] minute I've thought about it a little
[69:05] bit uh mostly in the context of trying
[69:09] to counteract on behalf of a client
[69:11] right so you have a client you know
[69:12] clients are think about this too like
[69:14] what happens if somebody steals the
[69:15] bitcoin
[69:17] well you can it's visible and so you
[69:20] want to just sort of have a sense of
[69:21] what what their option what are the what
[69:23] are the the bad guys going to do well
[69:25] the minute they get it into a wallet
[69:28] that has been seen elsewhere where
[69:30] they're maybe not going down, but you at
[69:32] least have a new thread to, you know,
[69:34] work back to them. So, like you said, um
[69:37] it's complicated and you got to really
[69:39] want to do it and u that isn't to say
[69:41] it's not going to happen. It obviously
[69:42] does and at scale. Um but but yeah, like
[69:47] get like getting it into a wallet that
[69:49] never gets touched um or when it does is
[69:52] completely anonymous is is a tall order.
[69:56] Um, yeah. I mean, I can there's probably
[69:59] a heist. Probably the most interesting
[70:01] part of a heist movie about this would
[70:04] be all of the shenanigans that you have
[70:06] to do to actually keep the Bitcoin. It's
[70:08] not getting the Bitcoin, it's keeping
[70:09] the Bitcoin at the end. Yeah.
[70:12] The series called Money Heist. I think
[70:15] that's that's a is a really good one.
[70:18] And the the really interesting part is
[70:21] when they flee from the I think it was
[70:23] Spanish central bank where they print
[70:25] their own money and then they get out of
[70:27] it and they kind of have to um confuse
[70:31] the police where they actually going and
[70:33] this is the the the real hard thing to
[70:36] do and if you already have that money
[70:38] and with Bitcoin it's even harder
[70:40] because you can track it forever. I mean
[70:43] you can coin join it and all those
[70:45] things. Um but the end of the day it's
[70:47] it's on the blockchain. You you see
[70:49] transactions going in, you see the
[70:51] transactions going out and uh you you
[70:54] have to be good and trained to actually
[70:57] hide that. Uh so yeah, but I remember
[71:00] the the one point that I I I was trying
[71:02] to to make that I kind of got toured by
[71:06] myself a little bit there. The point
[71:08] that I was trying to make is if every
[71:10] bitcoiner is making their bitcoins as
[71:14] secure as possible and if you come to
[71:16] their home you simply cannot get the
[71:19] bitcoin because they they simply cannot
[71:21] spend the bitcoin from their home
[71:22] because there's no bitcoin right there.
[71:25] If that's the
[71:26] default, there will be no more breakins.
[71:29] Like robbers are not stupid. If if right
[71:33] if if they they knock on the door and
[71:35] every time they get a key and they
[71:38] literally turn all the house upside down
[71:40] and there's nothing else there and he
[71:42] can he's like he's and all the people
[71:44] are like, "Yeah, you can shoot me, but I
[71:45] literally was I'm not able to spend my
[71:48] Bitcoin right here right now. Um so I
[71:50] cannot give it to you even if you
[71:52] torture my wife." like it's it's just
[71:54] not possible. Um they will learn from
[71:57] that. So I I think we should make it the
[72:00] default to make it really hard to get
[72:03] robbed. Even if you don't have a lot of
[72:05] Bitcoin, even if you're not famous, even
[72:07] if you're not an OG. Um because if
[72:10] you're now into Bitcoin, you will be at
[72:13] some point an OG. I think it's like we
[72:15] are so early that that you
[72:17] everyone will be in an OG. So that's
[72:20] right. Uh, get your get your Bitcoin
[72:22] security right. That's kind of my
[72:24] message. Totally. Well, right. I mean,
[72:27] speaking of security, there's always,
[72:28] you know, there's there's the current
[72:30] OGs are kind of obsessed with anonymity
[72:33] and security and making sure that nobody
[72:35] knows who they are and more power to
[72:37] them. That's a hard way to live and a
[72:39] hard way to go through the world. and an
[72:42] alternative to as you as you just
[72:44] pointed out I think as we get to the
[72:47] place where the default is uh whether
[72:49] it's multisig or some other similar um
[72:52] similar let's call it protocol security
[72:54] protocol when that becomes the default
[72:57] then making sure that other people know
[72:58] that that is the the protocol that you
[73:01] use one of those protocols I think does
[73:03] actually lower the likelihood that um
[73:06] that you get targeted specifically for
[73:08] your Bitcoin. It's it it's much more
[73:11] likely that you'll get caught in some
[73:12] sort of social um uh what's it called?
[73:16] Uh it's like a fishing, but also the um
[73:19] oh, social engineering. It's much more
[73:21] likely that someone convinces you to
[73:23] send your Bitcoin to them than somebody
[73:26] showing up with a gun in their hand.
[73:28] That we we see that all the time. I
[73:29] mean, it's really sad when it happens.
[73:31] And you know there's definitely people
[73:32] who get hoodwinkedked by um people that
[73:35] they think are their friends or trusted
[73:38] you know trusted partners who uh who are
[73:41] not who literally are are you know
[73:43] people on the other side of the world
[73:45] convincing them to send their Bitcoin to
[73:46] a new wallet. There's nothing you can do
[73:48] to get it back. It's it's so sad. It's
[73:52] it really is um a tragedy and and social
[73:55] engineering is is the one thing where
[73:57] where people really get uh get tricked.
[74:00] social engineering. Um I I I worked in
[74:03] IT security before actually. So I know
[74:06] for a fact that the biggest problems
[74:09] companies have, the biggest problems
[74:11] that uh people have be we always did it
[74:15] for companies. So when we worked with
[74:17] companies, the biggest problems they had
[74:19] is the baseline security and the people
[74:24] that were clicking on links and stuff
[74:26] like that. If you have a company with,
[74:27] let's say, 5,000 employees,
[74:30] you have to train them really good
[74:32] because there are um people in there
[74:35] that they get an email, they click on a
[74:37] link, and all of a sudden they're in the
[74:38] system, and they might get one, two,
[74:41] three other ones, and all of a sudden
[74:42] the systems are done. So, the social
[74:45] engineering aspect is the hardest to
[74:49] prevent because it's just they're just
[74:52] getting so good. And we've seen it with
[74:55] Larry La and Lin. They fell for for
[74:58] something like that. So, uh it's it's
[75:01] it's really hard to distinguish someone
[75:04] a scam from from something legit. It's
[75:07] actually funny after Sorry, just a small
[75:10] story on that. after that thing that
[75:12] happened with Larry and and Lyn all um I
[75:14] had two people that said like oh like
[75:17] sorry can can we because I always send
[75:19] out calendar links uh for people to
[75:21] click on and and and send it and that's
[75:23] literally the way the Larry and and and
[75:26] Lindol got scammed because scammers knew
[75:28] that this was a popular thing and uh two
[75:31] free guests of mine said like oh can can
[75:34] we please make the appointment normally
[75:36] uh because I'm so afraid right now to
[75:38] click on any link uh Oh, so it's it's
[75:42] unfortunate unfortunately. Well, just to
[75:45] pile on top of that with a couple of
[75:46] additional anecdotes, um, you know,
[75:48] there's so many people getting
[75:50] impersonated on X, for example. So, I'm
[75:53] sure you there's probably 15 different
[75:54] Robin Sarah out there um talking to
[75:57] people and if you are like we did if
[76:00] you're connecting through DMs and the
[76:02] person doesn't see that the name is
[76:03] spelled a little off or whatever they
[76:05] might actually think that they're
[76:06] interacting with you which I I think the
[76:08] Larry the Larry version is somebody
[76:10] posed as a Wall Street Journal um a Wall
[76:14] Street Journal reporter maybe not on X I
[76:16] can't remember some of the details but
[76:17] it was very much a like a person messing
[76:21] with Larry and I've had that happen to
[76:24] me and apppropo of what you're talking
[76:25] about not on X but um uh the version of
[76:28] mine was I started at a this is just a
[76:31] couple years ago so 20 2000 I guess it
[76:33] was 22 um and it was not a Bitcoin
[76:36] related thing it was just a you know
[76:38] scammer in general I started at a new
[76:40] company and the CEO of the company had
[76:45] recently had a profile of him in
[76:48] Bloomberg it was you know fairly well uh
[76:50] circulated article and it talked about
[76:53] how, you know, not to put too fine a
[76:56] point on it, how literally how wealthy
[76:57] he was. So he now becomes the target,
[77:00] but also the company becomes a target
[77:02] and any new person who works at the
[77:04] company is a target. And I it never even
[77:07] crossed my mind that that would be a
[77:09] thing that, you know, little old me, I'm
[77:11] just some guy that just got hired uh to
[77:13] do something, you know, super low level,
[77:16] but I'm I'm not, you know, anyway,
[77:19] whatever. I I got a phone scam, somebody
[77:22] posing as the CEO and I thought it was
[77:25] the CEO. I was like, it was day three or
[77:27] something like that. I had no idea that
[77:28] it wasn't him. Um and so they got me. It
[77:31] really sucked. And um going back to what
[77:34] you were saying a second ago, I think
[77:36] operational security when you're
[77:38] onboarding people um especially a
[77:41] company of any size or any notoriety is
[77:44] crucial. Next time I start a company of
[77:46] any size, it's going to be I'm going to
[77:48] say the same thing. Look, between all of
[77:50] the different touch points, like I'm not
[77:52] famous. Um, but I'm, you know, I'm out
[77:55] there talking to people on X about
[77:57] things that are targets. And so whatever
[77:59] company it is that I start, um I think
[78:02] every single new hire is going to get
[78:04] put through whether it's a half an hour
[78:07] or given a handbook plus a an actual,
[78:10] you know, face tof face conversation
[78:12] saying, "Look, you're going to get calls
[78:14] and emails from people pretending to be
[78:17] your colleagues. Here's how we're doing
[78:19] it. Do not trust it because it's too big
[78:22] a surface area." Um, I I hadn't I I
[78:26] hadn't talked to anybody who had gotten
[78:28] scammed like I had before. I just I
[78:30] literally had never heard of it uh
[78:32] happening before. Anyway, not that
[78:34] interesting except for me, but like yes,
[78:36] security is increasingly going to be a
[78:38] crucial component going forward. It it's
[78:41] super interesting at least for me
[78:43] because we had the policy every new hire
[78:47] the first thing before they get any
[78:49] access to any systems they have to go
[78:51] through a half day security um seminar
[78:54] basically they have to do that uh and
[78:57] it's I just want to put that on on uh
[79:01] how Larry happened because I've seen
[79:03] that a little bit close and it's it's
[79:04] it's really really great how they did
[79:07] that. It was right at the time where he
[79:10] came out with the book. So he booked
[79:12] right he he booked podcasts like every
[79:14] single day and it was always the same
[79:16] thing. Hey, do you want to be in my
[79:18] podcast? Here is the link. Click on it
[79:20] and booked. He does not have the time to
[79:23] like check the link and all the things.
[79:26] They did it so good. Um they asked like
[79:31] it was on Twitter and then on Twitter he
[79:34] got uh clicked on the link and then uh
[79:37] there was something coming up where the
[79:40] Google calendar was asking for the
[79:43] Twitter access which is a weird thing.
[79:46] Why would Google calendar use the access
[79:48] for Twitter? But they just granted it
[79:51] and it was not actually Google calendar.
[79:53] It was a the hackers uh uh um um
[79:57] software but it looked like Google
[79:59] calendar and then they got access
[80:02] through a third party to Twitter. It was
[80:04] not that the Twitter account got hacked
[80:06] actually just that they granted a third
[80:10] party access to their Twitter account
[80:13] and so then they could actually tweet on
[80:15] their name on their accounts and then
[80:17] this whole thing uh started where they
[80:20] they posted weird things. So Larry
[80:22] actually got uh banned from Twitter for
[80:25] for some time. Uh so it it is something
[80:28] if you like you click on a link and
[80:30] you're like, "Oh yeah, Google Canada
[80:31] needs the access. Okay, let's do it
[80:33] quickly and and let's let's let's book
[80:36] that." In a moment where you're not
[80:39] aware and you you just rush through that
[80:41] because as Larry, if you're like
[80:43] launching a book, it can be very
[80:44] stressful time and it can be a very busy
[80:46] time. U that's totally understandable.
[80:49] It this was it was one of the most
[80:51] sophisticated fishing um or however you
[80:54] you call it attacks that that I've ever
[80:59] seen it. It was really and I actually
[81:01] got it since then like five times from
[81:04] from people like, "Oh, we want to
[81:06] feature you on Bloomberg." And I'm like,
[81:08] "Yeah, no, sorry, not
[81:11] right." Yeah. That's a whole other level
[81:14] that that I I didn't realize. Like it
[81:17] there's a person who has decided to fish
[81:20] Larry. Like that's what kind of blows my
[81:22] mind. It's one thing like I'm sure you
[81:25] get um you probably get texts from
[81:27] Coinbase, Coinbase customer service,
[81:29] both calls and and texts. I get that I
[81:32] for the last like 3 or 4 months it's
[81:34] been not literally every day but several
[81:36] a week of both of those things. And I
[81:38] assume that a significant chunk of that,
[81:40] if not all of it is
[81:42] automated and my number that they're
[81:45] texting or calling is just in a list.
[81:49] But in the case we're talking about with
[81:50] Larry, some guy or girl, whatever, they
[81:54] decided to to attack him and it's just
[81:56] kind of it's mind-blowing that it's that
[81:58] that it's one to one like that. Kind of
[82:01] freaky a little bit too. Yeah,
[82:02] absolutely. They they get more and more
[82:04] detailed. But
[82:06] uh to to come back because we're already
[82:10] uh over one and a half hours and uh by
[82:12] the way, thank you so much for for being
[82:13] on the podcast. My pleasure. I I know
[82:15] it's it's it's late for you. It's
[82:17] cutting. It's It's midnight for you,
[82:19] right? Uh yeah, it's 11:30 p.m. as we're
[82:23] recording, but I'm like I said at the,
[82:25] you know, as we were just starting, I'm
[82:27] I'm a bit of a night owl, so this is no
[82:28] problem. Ah, yeah. I just want to It's
[82:30] my pleasure and thank you for having me.
[82:32] Um, we have one question that I ask each
[82:34] and every one of my guests. Uh, and the
[82:36] question is, what can we learn from you
[82:38] besides Bitcoin? Um, besides Bitcoin,
[82:41] wow. most of my lessons these days are
[82:43] or my wisdom is sort of related to
[82:46] Bitcoin or at least some of the first
[82:47] principles around Bitcoin. I guess maybe
[82:50] that's it. um the if there's a
[82:54] throughine of the things that I am proud
[82:57] of uh or I consider successful in my
[83:00] life from you know co-founding and
[83:02] starting companies or helping grow
[83:04] companies or joining a company like the
[83:07] Bitcoin adviser um or in my work with
[83:10] consulting clients um starting from
[83:14] first principles as often as possible is
[83:17] always the winning move. Um, not to
[83:20] sound like I'm, you know, coining a
[83:22] slogan or something, but whenever I have
[83:24] a whenever I have a hard question to
[83:27] answer or a thing that needs to get
[83:29] solved, um, you know, I just go back to
[83:32] those core questions of what are we
[83:34] trying to do here? What what do I know
[83:35] to be true? What what is the essence of
[83:37] this thing? And what are we trying to
[83:39] accomplish if it's a problem to solve?
[83:41] Um, and it's related to Bitcoin though
[83:43] as I as I alluded to a second ago in
[83:45] that um, Bitcoin is sort of embedded
[83:50] into first principles these days.
[83:52] Bitcoin is money. Bitcoin is the
[83:56] starting point for so many things and
[83:59] starting there with so many on, you
[84:01] know, on so many paths um, is a really
[84:04] smart place to be. So, I made it about
[84:07] Bitcoin anyway, but uh, there you go.
[84:09] Don't forget first principles. I I love
[84:11] the the first principle because I I
[84:13] think if you if you want to understand
[84:16] Bitcoin, you have to look at it from
[84:18] first principles. Otherwise, you will
[84:20] not understand it. Yeah, really good
[84:22] point. That's right. Um, thank you so
[84:24] much. We have an endine in the podcast
[84:25] where the previous guest is asking a
[84:27] question for the next guest without
[84:28] knowing who the next guest actually is
[84:30] and the previous guest asked you the
[84:32] question, what is the most important
[84:34] value Bitcoin taught you? Uh, low time
[84:37] preference. That is a really crucial
[84:40] one. And just to give an anecdote there,
[84:43] um uh the so when I was a when I was
[84:47] young in my 20s in particular before I
[84:49] became a father, I I've had this
[84:51] conversation with new dads a lot um over
[84:53] the past 10 years or so. Um I used to be
[84:57] able to see like I used to be able to
[84:59] plan out 6 months, 12 months, maybe a
[85:02] little bit beyond 12 months, but I
[85:04] literally just couldn't think much
[85:06] further than that. I could make plans
[85:07] and I could have a goal that's further
[85:09] but I just couldn't I couldn't sort of
[85:11] strategize that well beyond that and
[85:14] then I had my daughter and suddenly I
[85:16] could think in terms of 20 years
[85:18] something about that experience just
[85:20] extended my horizon but it didn't I mean
[85:23] and it and it sort of um it was
[85:25] meaningful in terms of how I approached
[85:27] business and relationships and I really
[85:29] sort of thought about long term but I
[85:31] didn't think about
[85:32] money in a long-term way. Oddly, you
[85:35] would think that that would be just an
[85:36] organic way and, you know, just part of
[85:38] it. Um, but Bitcoin taught me both, you
[85:42] know, because of the scar tissue from
[85:44] 2017 to 2021 and 2022 in particular,
[85:48] both of those, um, you know, that sort
[85:50] of cataclysmic era. Um, the low time
[85:55] preference is one of the strongest first
[85:57] principles you can bring to it. If
[85:59] you're not thinking about the next
[86:01] quarter or the next year or even the
[86:03] next four years, if you're thinking a
[86:05] full epoch or even 10 years or 20 years
[86:08] down the line and plan accordingly, it's
[86:11] a super powerful uh principle to bring
[86:14] to bear and and mostly mostly it's a
[86:17] Bitcoin thing for me these days. I I
[86:19] love that so much. Really really cool.
[86:21] Um before I let you go, where can people
[86:23] find you and ask you questions? Yeah.
[86:26] Uh, I'm happy to take emails at my
[86:29] Bitcoin advisor address, which is Jason
[86:33] the
[86:34] bitcoinadvisor.com. Advisor uh has an e,
[86:36] not an o. The the bitcoin advisor with
[86:39] an
[86:39] e.com. Um, and then I'm my DMs are open
[86:42] on X as well. So, my handle at X is Jco
[86:47] Scoggins and my last name is S O G I N.
[86:50] You probably could see it on the on the
[86:52] podcast here, but just in case, J.
[86:54] Scoggins. Um, yeah, thank you so much.
[86:57] I'm happy to interact with people about
[87:00] any of the stuff we talked about or or
[87:02] whatever. And uh and thanks again for
[87:04] having me. Awesome. Thank you so much
