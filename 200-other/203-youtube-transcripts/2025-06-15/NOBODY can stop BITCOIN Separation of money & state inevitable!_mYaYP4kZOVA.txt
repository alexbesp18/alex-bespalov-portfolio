[00:00] the separation of money and state it's
[00:01] inevitable it's impossible to circumvent
[00:04] the economic laws the law of Economics
[00:06] apply with the same strength as the laws
[00:08] of physics if you have some tool that
[00:11] better fits the human nature of this
[00:13] Thrive for prosperity and for the better
[00:16] future for the kids people will adopt it
[00:18] and there is nothing you can do against
[00:21] that North Korea will fall apart in the
[00:23] end as well because you cannot change
[00:25] the innate nature of people to want to
[00:27] be more prosperous to have better lives
[00:29] to societies that are already on the
[00:32] Bitcoin standard will be just so better
[00:34] off that people will just adopt it
[00:36] hyperbitcoinization will happen there's
[00:38] nothing anybody can do about it I'm very
[00:41] optimistic about Surinam with the
[00:43] presidential candidate Maya Barb they
[00:45] have the election next year and she's a
[00:46] hardcore bitcoiner so that might be the
[00:49] next country to ad up Bitcoin as a legal
[00:51] tender hyperbitcoinization in the first
[00:53] phase will be mostly about the global
[00:55] South Africa needs Bitcoin and Bitcoin
[00:57] needs Africa Bitcoin needs to succeed in
[00:59] Africa in the places where the internet
[01:01] coverage isn't as good the financial
[01:03] literacy isn't as good but these people
[01:05] need it the
[01:10] most how big is the the community in
[01:13] Czech you feel like it's uh in Germany
[01:16] like there's such a strong community in
[01:18] in the Germans speaking area is it the
[01:19] same in in in Czech MH yes uh I would
[01:23] say per capita uh Czech Republic is is
[01:27] maybe uh like the most hardcore Bitcoin
[01:31] Community but I can imagine a lot of
[01:34] people uh like have this impression like
[01:37] for their own country because uh for
[01:40] example from outside uh people don't see
[01:43] like what's uh the German content or
[01:46] what's the Czech content or what's the
[01:48] Italian content and usually the local
[01:51] content producers don't do that much in
[01:53] English so uh it's sometimes hard to
[01:56] estimate how the community actually how
[02:00] large it is from outside but uh to give
[02:02] you some some numbers uh the
[02:05] largest uh Bitcoin only YouTuber in
[02:08] check has almost 100,000
[02:11] subscribers uh and that's for basically
[02:15] 15 million
[02:17] speakers um because Czech and Slovak we
[02:20] understand each other it's very similar
[02:22] and that's 15 million people so 100,000
[02:25] uh and it's it's really Bitcoin only
[02:28] content so it's quite good
[02:30] and the Europe's largest uh Bitcoin
[02:34] conference that's BTC prag uh I believe
[02:37] it was around 8,000 people this year in
[02:41] June uh yeah so the community is very
[02:46] very large here and I would say quite
[02:50] well educated in terms of self- custody
[02:53] privacy vexel uh the non kyc
[02:56] peer-to-peer
[02:57] network uh that's that's from Czech rep
[03:00] repu a lot of ecosystem companies like
[03:03] treasure brains come from Czech Republic
[03:06] yeah so uh I would say Czech repu is
[03:08] quite important in the Bitcoin space I
[03:10] love the conference Also let's just jump
[03:13] into the podcast with with that as an
[03:15] entry um I think I I really L the the
[03:18] the conference there it was my first big
[03:20] conference that I ever was uh and there
[03:22] was the past two years there and I will
[03:25] 100% it's already in my calendar next
[03:27] year I will be definitely there uh and
[03:29] after now to other conferences also but
[03:32] I've never seen such a big conference
[03:35] where the crowd is such hardcore on
[03:38] bitcoin like I've been on on bitcoin
[03:40] magazines once I have been on other
[03:42] conferences uh but I feel like for the
[03:45] scale of it like of course they like
[03:46] local Bitcoin meetups where like 50
[03:48] people that's probably the most hardcore
[03:50] crowd ever uh but for like the scale
[03:53] like the 8,000 people there it's an
[03:55] extreme like Bitcoin privacy security
[03:59] Focus conference I I I really like the
[04:01] one in Prague and that's why I also
[04:02] partnered up last year uh for two months
[04:04] to to get some extra ticket sales for
[04:06] the conference and I love the the
[04:08] partnership there and I will definitely
[04:10] do it again if if if they open to it
[04:13] because I really like what they're doing
[04:14] in in prog there yeah it really is
[04:17] amazing uh the Kash Brothers uh the
[04:20] organizers um they really pulled it off
[04:25] and the story there is uh they've been
[04:27] doing uh like local uh check only uh
[04:31] Bitcoin conferences they started small
[04:33] scale like couple hundred people uh in
[04:37] ostrava which is like the third largest
[04:39] prag city so it's not even the capital
[04:42] uh they come from there and they've been
[04:43] doing uh this conference since 2020 it's
[04:47] called chain camp that conference grew
[04:50] to around 2,000 people and then uh they
[04:56] uh they have gotten like um ambition
[05:00] and they put it off with BTC PR so they
[05:03] scaled it up so they knew how to scale
[05:05] the conference already before and
[05:06] they've been running Bitcoin only events
[05:08] before uh and that's why BTC PR was uh
[05:11] like even the first year was quite a
[05:13] success around five to 6,000 people and
[05:17] yeah they just wanted to do
[05:18] International Event when they got the
[05:21] experience from local events and they
[05:23] really the best qualified uh guys to do
[05:27] that H in in general I think there's a
[05:30] lot of development and history of
[05:32] Bitcoin in uh Prague in Jack in general
[05:36] you mentioned already a lot of a lot of
[05:38] things there um how like why is why did
[05:42] so much crew in check like what what did
[05:44] maybe the the country uh Prime to to be
[05:47] so freedom and focused on on
[05:49] bitcoin yeah so I believe um part of
[05:53] that is like General Czech history uh
[05:57] because Czechoslovakia
[06:00] after World War I was one of the most
[06:04] developed countries in Europe and also
[06:07] like one of the 20 most developed
[06:09] countries in the world uh lots of um
[06:12] like heavy machinery was was made here
[06:15] like the automotive Industries has a
[06:18] large history in Czech Republic
[06:21] uh uh and so um like
[06:24] 1918 till
[06:27] 1938 uh Czechoslovakia was on a really
[06:31] good track it was basically the only
[06:33] country in central eastern Europe that
[06:35] didn't suffer from
[06:36] hyperinflation um our uh Finance
[06:40] Minister back then Alo rashin he was a
[06:43] sound money guy he wanted to return to
[06:45] the gold standard uh from the pre
[06:48] pre-war period and he mostly pulled it
[06:50] off Czechoslovakia back then msed around
[06:53] 100 tons of gold uh we had a period of
[06:56] uh deflation that was like government
[06:59] driven
[07:00] deflation um Al rashin the Finance
[07:03] Minister knew the austrians he uh quoted
[07:07] the Austrian School of Economics uh in
[07:09] his speeches so it was really amazing
[07:11] then he was assassinated by a communist
[07:14] activist so um he didn't like finish
[07:18] that job but still Czechoslovakia for
[07:20] this 20-y year period was really quite
[07:22] Advanced then uh we had the Nazi
[07:25] invasion uh World War II when we were
[07:28] under the Nazi but still checks fought
[07:31] back
[07:32] uh uh like the the the country manager
[07:37] was assassinated uh in in prag so we
[07:40] fought back uh but unfortunately after
[07:43] World War II uh we didn't get back on
[07:46] the right track anymore and uh
[07:48] Communists came to power in
[07:51] 1948 uh we had the Communist Regime for
[07:54] 40
[07:55] years and um still there was always some
[08:00] kind of opposition to uh to that so
[08:04] there's quite a lot of libertarian
[08:05] spirit in Czech people I would say and
[08:08] in the '90s
[08:09] uh when the Soviet Union fell and the
[08:12] the whole iron curton fell checks um
[08:18] managed to sort of get back on the right
[08:20] track in terms of free market economy
[08:23] Austrian economists were again quoted in
[08:26] the Parliament and in the official
[08:28] discussions so it was it was like a
[08:32] continuation of a very good
[08:34] tradition and uh I guess uh checks
[08:38] always remained kind of skeptical of the
[08:40] authorities after the Nazis and the
[08:43] Communists and so then I mean very early
[08:48] on in 2010 uh there were checks that uh
[08:52] understood Bitcoin what for what it is
[08:56] and uh to give some concrete examples
[09:00] uh Slash he founded the slash pool the
[09:03] world's first uh public mining pool that
[09:06] is still in operation as a brain spool
[09:09] uh then he went on to found uh or to
[09:13] invent uh the hardware wallet treasure
[09:15] the world's firstest Hardware wallet uh
[09:17] along with stick so slush and stick are
[09:19] the founders of treasure or
[09:22] sataps uh brains uh emerged as a company
[09:26] that started to manage the brain spool
[09:28] uh and and also General bites uh the ATM
[09:32] company Bitcoin ATM company that's also
[09:35] uh comes from prag and basically all
[09:38] these three companies are just close
[09:40] friends that know each other from from
[09:42] from um like a hackers lab um from
[09:47] before uh so a lot of I would say
[09:50] technical talent in prag in Czech
[09:52] Republic uh there's quite a good
[09:54] Technical University in BR uh that's
[09:57] also uh like well combined with u sort
[10:02] of like a Libertarian spirit and skep
[10:05] skeptical attitude towards authorities
[10:08] so Bitcoin took uh took on very early on
[10:11] in I love that a lot really cool it's in
[10:14] the middle of of Europe basically and
[10:17] it's uh I hope this big Bitcoin spirit
[10:20] that we have in Czech but also in the
[10:21] German speaking area there's like a
[10:23] German the biggest because we talked
[10:25] about before the biggest uh uh German
[10:28] YouTube channel channel uh has almost
[10:31] 200,000 subscribers now uh which is also
[10:34] massively impressive for me because it's
[10:36] just German content uh there are way
[10:38] more German uh speakers that not way
[10:41] more but some more than than than from
[10:43] Czech people but still uh really
[10:45] impressive so I feel like we have a a
[10:48] good Grassroots movement in Europe but
[10:51] the policies and the EU is is is kind of
[10:54] uh on the other side of that where we
[10:57] see politicians not talking about it I
[10:59] don't know is that in check also like
[11:00] the the politican and the regulatory
[11:03] framework is against or is just not
[11:05] talking about it yeah so that's a good
[11:08] question because right now there's a
[11:10] discussion about uh sort of uh
[11:14] implementing what do you already have in
[11:16] Germany where if you hold Bitcoin for uh
[11:19] in Germany it's 12 months I believe if
[11:21] you hold it hold it for more than 12
[11:23] months there's no capital gain stxs and
[11:26] right now uh in Czech Republic I believe
[11:29] it's it's a parliament uh there's a
[11:32] similar discussion that if uh like the
[11:35] test would be for three years so if you
[11:37] hold Bitcoin for more than three years
[11:39] there will also be no capital gain STX
[11:43] um it's evolving basically as we speak
[11:46] uh there's now like a campaign to
[11:49] contact your uh Parliament member your
[11:52] MP to push for that as I said the Czech
[11:56] Bitcoin Community is very strong there's
[11:58] uh hundreds of thousands of people I
[12:00] would say and uh so we'll see uh by it
[12:07] should be implemented by uh January so
[12:10] if everything goes well then uh since
[12:14] 2025 we will also have zero capital
[12:16] gains tax if you hold Bitcoin for some
[12:18] period uh there are of course some
[12:21] people um sort of opposed to that
[12:23] because it might mean that uh the
[12:25] Bitcoin you hold uh needs to be kyc uh
[12:29] and there's a strong non kyc community
[12:31] in Czech Republic but I see it as as an
[12:34] option if you if you uh want to you can
[12:37] have like a kyc stack and a non kyc
[12:39] stack and um if you understand what
[12:41] you're doing it's always better to have
[12:43] these options to have the kyc stack that
[12:46] can be taxfree after some period and the
[12:49] non kyc stack which is like more private
[12:51] and uh nobody needs to know about that
[12:54] so uh yeah from uh the like uh top down
[12:58] point of view this is the major
[13:00] discussion now also uh M the uh European
[13:05] uh regulation
[13:07] Mica and uh that actually might be a
[13:12] little bit uh of a help to check Bitcoin
[13:16] ecosystem because in Czech Republic
[13:18] there's a huge problem with uh Banks
[13:21] closing down accounts of uh the Bitcoin
[13:24] or crypto companies and I believe right
[13:28] now there's maybe one last bank standing
[13:31] that's uh that keeps the accounts open
[13:33] to the companies and with Micah uh one
[13:38] good outcome might be that if you have
[13:39] that license the banks won't uh be able
[13:42] to basically reject you or at least
[13:44] that's the idea but it's not my field of
[13:47] expertise I I just know from some
[13:50] podcast guests of mine that uh this is
[13:54] this is basically the two uh the two
[13:57] main Topics in the political sphere in
[13:59] Republic the capital gain STX and the
[14:01] new European uh
[14:04] regulation yeah in Austria they
[14:06] unfortunately had this period of like if
[14:09] you hold it longer than one year but
[14:10] they actually uh reverted that so since
[14:14] like February 2021 is not possible
[14:16] anymore but Germany still has it but
[14:18] Austria unfortunately not um yeah really
[14:21] cool um you also said you want to talk
[14:23] about the the the African Community uh
[14:26] which is really interesting for me
[14:27] because it's so different than uh we
[14:31] have it in Europe uh I I really like to
[14:34] compare like different communities in in
[14:35] in Bitcoin you also have the what is
[14:38] this Bitcoin easi I think it's the the
[14:40] shirt right yeah Bitcoin easi first of
[14:43] all like what what are you doing uh in
[14:44] in Africa and and what do you see there
[14:47] in the community yeah so um what I'm
[14:50] doing is running the treasure Academy so
[14:53] treasur is the hardware wallet company
[14:56] and um we came up with the nonprofit uh
[15:00] educational initiative that's focused on
[15:02] the global South so mostly Africa
[15:05] partially Caribbean and South America
[15:08] and the idea is idea there is uh to find
[15:12] local Bitcoin Educators uh that want to
[15:16] spread uh the awareness the knowledge of
[15:20] uh of Bitcoin and how how to use prop
[15:24] Bitcoin how not to fall for some
[15:26] scams and um
[15:30] uh to offer them some kind of support So
[15:33] treasure Academia is the program U it's
[15:37] uh it's a series of three physical
[15:40] meetups where it needs to be run by a
[15:43] local Bitcoin educator it's Bitcoin only
[15:46] uh there is an explanation of like
[15:49] onchain lightning self custle versus
[15:51] custle wallets um Hardware wallets
[15:55] versus software wallets uh and my job is
[15:59] to look for these local Bitcoin
[16:01] Educators uh find out whether they are
[16:04] like a real deal uh whether they really
[16:07] like are good at organizing uh people
[16:12] getting the group together that's really
[16:14] interested in finding more about Bitcoin
[16:17] uh and if they are like if they
[16:19] understand Bitcoin properly and uh yeah
[16:23] then they run the meetups we provide
[16:25] them with some merch some devices for a
[16:27] giveaway some fin Financial Resources uh
[16:31] the curriculum is fully like written by
[16:33] me and uh but there are some local
[16:38] flavors because uh for example I don't
[16:42] know in Jamaica uh the the the context
[16:45] is a little bit different than from for
[16:47] example in Nigeria so we have uh
[16:50] multiple curriculums already for
[16:52] different parts of work uh multiple
[16:55] languages uh so so that we have like
[16:58] French speak Africa covered and English
[17:00] speaking Africa uh Spanish as well we
[17:03] have run the program in Venezuela and
[17:05] Mexico several times and yeah um it's
[17:11] uh it's um like it's not scalable to
[17:15] millions of people because we want the
[17:17] meetups to be physical in person that's
[17:20] what I personally believe works the best
[17:22] it worked uh for sort of orange pink me
[17:25] and all like the Bitcoin ORS basically
[17:28] that I know uh you need some uh real
[17:32] contact uh with both teacher and the
[17:35] other students let's say because you
[17:38] have if you are a newcomer to bitcoin
[17:40] you always have plenty of questions and
[17:43] also it needs to be local because um
[17:47] learning about Bitcoin from the major
[17:50] podcasts let's say from Peter McCormack
[17:52] Stefan Nea and such um it wouldn't
[17:56] probably uh give you answers to your
[17:57] questions in terms of of how uh how can
[18:00] I use Bitcoin um in my in my community
[18:04] uh because the use cases for Bitcoin uh
[18:07] are really quite different from place to
[18:09] place uh in some places you need uh like
[18:13] the remittance payments to get money
[18:15] from your family members abroad in other
[18:18] places you're looking for uh lightweight
[18:22] Merchant POS
[18:24] systems uh and in in most places in
[18:28] global South it's it's not about store
[18:29] of value it's not about uh saving in
[18:31] Bitcoin it's more about uh getting some
[18:35] access to digital transactions because
[18:37] uh there's a huge unbanked
[18:40] population of the even if you have some
[18:44] digital payment Trails they usually
[18:46] don't work that well uh cross
[18:49] border um you have Flo shedding you
[18:52] maybe don't even have uh like a
[18:54] smartphone you have the feature phone
[18:56] and there are solutions for all of that
[18:58] but you won't usually find out about
[19:02] them from like the major Global podcast
[19:05] so you need like this local flavor and
[19:08] yeah that's what we do with treasure
[19:10] academy uh it's uh Bitcoin meetups by
[19:13] locals for
[19:14] locals I I love that a lot really really
[19:17] cool um and you also like you write that
[19:20] curriculum but you also wrote uh a book
[19:23] I think uh where you talk about the
[19:25] separation between money and state is
[19:27] that correct yeah yeah the the book is
[19:30] called Bitcoin separation of money and
[19:32] state and um yeah I first wrote that
[19:36] book uh just in check my
[19:39] language um because it's uh I sort of uh
[19:45] thought about it as
[19:47] a concise version of the Bitcoin
[19:50] standard by saine and uh there there
[19:53] wasn't any such book in in check at that
[19:57] time when I was writing it which was in
[19:59] 2020 uh it's translated into English uh
[20:03] people still find Value in it even
[20:05] though like uh it's like not that
[20:07] revolutionary in terms of Bitcoin books
[20:10] uh but yeah I have like a very good uh
[20:16] feedback on the book uh we send it to
[20:20] Africa or South America as part of the
[20:23] treasure Academy program along with with
[20:26] a book by C camunian auth that's called
[20:29] Bitcoin kits uh that's like a little bit
[20:31] of a cartoon take on bitcoin uh but to
[20:35] get back to my book uh so uh the content
[20:39] of the book is uh uh a little bit of an
[20:43] explanation of monetary history and why
[20:46] uh uh the government or the king or the
[20:49] ruler always the basis the currency it's
[20:52] not just the problem of fiat currency it
[20:54] used to be a problem uh with like the
[20:57] coin uh sound money currency let's say
[21:00] so with gold and silver you always had
[21:02] uh some debasement going on uh even
[21:05] though like uh the the coin U stayed uh
[21:10] unde based for hundreds of years there
[21:12] always comes some crisis uh some ruler
[21:15] that wants to uh get something for free
[21:18] so they debase the currency like couple
[21:20] of percent in terms of uh gold or silver
[21:24] content and then you always see how it
[21:27] falls off and within uh couple of years
[21:29] the currency is totally totally debased
[21:32] uh and destroyed and we have seen that
[21:35] in Greece in Rome in uh in the colonial
[21:39] period in in
[21:41] America uh and basically everywhere we
[21:43] look uh and Fiat is just like a
[21:47] logical um um like it follows logically
[21:51] from that because the ruler always looks
[21:54] for ways how to get some funds without
[21:57] direct taxation
[21:59] and uh the currency basement is the is
[22:03] the way how to do that uh and like from
[22:07] that basis I explain the concept of time
[22:10] preference how uh the
[22:12] currency uh in influences uh the
[22:16] individual and societal time preferences
[22:18] meaning how much we plan uh for our
[22:23] future both as individuals and families
[22:26] and
[22:27] societies and why we need sound money uh
[22:30] to uh have like a civilized prosperous
[22:33] society and why Bitcoin is that sound
[22:36] money or the best candidates for that
[22:38] type of sound money and so that's that's
[22:41] basically the the the the whole content
[22:43] of the book uh I really enjoyed writing
[22:46] that I believe u writing a book um
[22:50] usually it should be um the the author
[22:54] should be writing the book for himself
[22:56] that's that's what I found that uh I
[22:58] used to be into old coins as well like
[23:00] before I wrote the book even though I
[23:02] had like my suspicions that
[23:05] uh it's not all As It Seems and after I
[23:09] sat down to write the book uh about like
[23:12] one our historian Austrian School school
[23:14] of Economics I convinced myself that
[23:17] Bitcoin is the only way or is it's the
[23:19] best candidate for like a global sound
[23:21] money standard again uh so yeah I highly
[23:25] encourage anyone to try uh writing uh
[23:29] either articles or arguments or maybe
[23:34] even books because it's a it's a great
[23:37] uh learning uh experience for for you I
[23:42] I L it a lot because um I thought I know
[23:47] Bitcoin quite well before I started the
[23:49] podcast and I did it like 11 months ago
[23:52] something like that so I'm I'm soon
[23:54] hitting the one year mark and I'm quite
[23:57] aggressive with guests like I have every
[23:59] day a guest so I have now you a 280th
[24:02] guest uh and it's fascinating how stupid
[24:07] I was in regards to bitcoin like 11
[24:10] months ago how much I learned now that
[24:13] like because I interviewed so many
[24:15] people and because I gained that
[24:17] knowledge I started just like writing
[24:19] down some thoughts and some Inspirations
[24:20] that I had from each podcast and some
[24:22] learnings that I maybe had just to like
[24:24] organize my thoughts uh and this
[24:27] document is getting bigger and bigger
[24:29] and bigger and bigger and I'm actually
[24:31] right now in the process of like just
[24:33] ordering it and either I make a series
[24:35] of Articles or just like a small PDF
[24:38] book that I just like send everyone for
[24:40] free uh but it's it's really a nice
[24:44] process like just writing down your
[24:46] thoughts is a learning process which I
[24:49] didn't thought before like that I just
[24:51] discovered that like four months ago
[24:53] basically that writing is a really
[24:55] interesting thing to to just learn like
[24:57] just writing down thoughts is is a
[24:59] learning process I I like the way that
[25:02] you're thinking about that also um the
[25:05] the title was really interesting for me
[25:07] separating money from State I mean there
[25:09] there even some bitcoiners that are
[25:11] skeptical of like how fast we we get
[25:13] there or if we even get there that every
[25:16] state in in this world will get rid of
[25:18] Fiat money and that we completely live
[25:21] um on money that is not owned by the
[25:23] government is that the idea of like uh
[25:26] separating money from state that that
[25:28] there's no Fe currency and we have only
[25:32] uh Bitcoin or any other sound money I
[25:35] think there can only be Bitcoin but uh
[25:37] do do you think that yeah um so my main
[25:41] or argument or how I think about this is
[25:45] uh the economic laws always apply in the
[25:49] end it's uh impossible to circumvent the
[25:52] economic laws the law of Economics uh
[25:56] and in a very similar fashion how it's
[25:59] impossible to uh go around the loss of
[26:03] physics I believe the loss of Economics
[26:06] basically apply with the same strength
[26:08] as the law of laws of physics and we
[26:10] have seen time and time again that uh
[26:14] the politicians the bureaucrats or the
[26:16] voters try to circumvent that uh and
[26:19] imagine lots of economists like the Fiat
[26:22] mainstream economists imagine that uh
[26:25] loss of Economics are something that can
[26:27] be bent to their will and that it's just
[26:31] uh like some convention that can be
[26:34] changed but we have seen that like with
[26:36] the Soviet Union with the North Korea
[26:39] with Argentina Venezuela Kuba that uh it
[26:44] never works and it never works because
[26:46] people have some
[26:50] uh um they have this drive to be more
[26:55] prosperous uh than they were before and
[26:57] for their kids to have a better lives
[27:00] and uh you have this concept of time
[27:02] preference of course as well uh and uh
[27:07] so the argument there is uh if you have
[27:13] some tool that uh better fits the human
[27:15] nature of uh this drive for prosperity
[27:19] and uh for the better future for the
[27:21] kids uh people will adopt it uh and
[27:26] there is nothing you can do against that
[27:29] uh in the same way where uh I believe
[27:32] North Korea will fall apart in the end
[27:34] as well because you cannot change the uh
[27:37] innate nature of people to want to be
[27:40] more prosperous to have better lives so
[27:43] uh the separation of money and state I
[27:45] believe it's inevitable doesn't mean
[27:48] there uh it it will happen like in the
[27:50] next five or 10 years doesn't mean there
[27:53] won't be any uh fat currencies uh right
[27:56] next to bitcoin for for for some time
[27:59] just means that uh it will
[28:02] become uh it will become uh very hard to
[28:07] argue for the Fiat regime as something
[28:11] that uh is aligned with human Prosperity
[28:14] same as it was harder and harder for the
[28:17] Soviet Union to uh continue the fairy
[28:20] tale that Socialism or communism is uh
[28:23] something that brings prosperity to the
[28:26] people when the the Soviet or the Soviet
[28:28] citizens could see that in West Germany
[28:32] or in the US people were much better off
[28:35] much happier much more prosperous much
[28:38] healthier and I believe like with
[28:41] Bitcoin it's very similar to this clash
[28:43] between let's say Soviet Union and the
[28:45] western style of capitalism so the Fiat
[28:48] regimes and uh societies doesn't have to
[28:51] be nation states but societies that are
[28:55] uh already on the Bitcoin standard will
[28:57] be just so better off uh and even so
[29:02] much more civilized even in terms of
[29:04] let's say culture that uh people will
[29:07] just adopt it whatever they think about
[29:10] that because uh yeah people have this
[29:12] preference for leav leading Better Lives
[29:16] even if uh rationally they have
[29:20] some uh they have some like weird ideas
[29:22] about socialism and uh and stuff so yeah
[29:27] it's inevitable I'm very optimistic
[29:28] about that uh hyperbitcoinization will
[29:30] happen there's nothing anybody can do
[29:33] about it uh
[29:35] so uh yeah that's that's about it if you
[29:39] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[29:41] regular basis I'll guess you already
[29:43] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[29:46] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[29:49] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[29:52] personal recommendation for harder
[29:53] wallet is the bit box it's super secure
[29:56] it's simple to set up it's also a
[29:58] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[30:00] the Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[30:03] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[30:06] the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss
[30:10] robobin to get your bitbox and the next
[30:13] step is to really level up your
[30:15] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[30:18] have the most secure self- custody setup
[30:21] you have to secure your own devices you
[30:24] have to protect your privacy you have to
[30:26] set up an enh parenton plan and
[30:29] depending on where you live you even
[30:31] want to have a plan B a citizenship
[30:33] where you can move in case something
[30:36] goes really really wrong and through all
[30:38] those steps the Bitcoin way is guiding
[30:40] you through step by step and if you
[30:43] visit the Bitcoin way.com
[30:46] Partners robobin you even get a 30
[30:48] minute free call to find out how you can
[30:51] level up your sovereignty and last but
[30:54] not least I have something completely
[30:56] new for you guys I partnered up with
[31:00] coin vigilante this is the most
[31:02] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[31:05] saw created by anyone look at that
[31:08] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[31:11] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[31:14] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[31:17] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[31:19] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[31:23] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[31:26] new and amazing gen is edition of their
[31:29] watch collections you have the date of
[31:32] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[31:35] there and of course also the block
[31:37] height and which EPO we are currently in
[31:41] I love the level of detail they put in
[31:44] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[31:46] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[31:49] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[31:52] love those watches so so much I I I love
[31:56] I love the confidence in
[31:58] in that and it was fascinating for me to
[32:01] see how many bitcoiners actually don't
[32:04] believe in that like how many bitcoiners
[32:05] actually very skeptical of uh completely
[32:08] eroding feed away but if you just like
[32:10] think about it logically um at some
[32:13] point you don't want Fe like I'm already
[32:16] at that point where if I had the choice
[32:18] somehow I would just not use feed
[32:20] anymore uh and if that is not like 1% of
[32:24] the population but like 40% of the
[32:27] population or maybe even lower than like
[32:29] probably it needs like a small group of
[32:32] people uh to really push the the tide
[32:35] over over that how do you imagine that I
[32:38] think the transition time is the most
[32:40] fascinating one because we are now
[32:42] knowing okay we we are here with like a
[32:44] little bit of Bitcoin adoption but
[32:46] mostly everything is still in fear and
[32:49] what we will get to the point where
[32:51] there's only this High Bitcoin ised
[32:53] World um how do you imagine that
[32:55] transition time to there do you also see
[32:58] like some some not so peaceful
[33:00] transition there yeah um I think the
[33:05] Western countries basically have it
[33:07] worse because the Fiat money uh sort of
[33:10] works uh for us for Europeans or
[33:14] Americans um Americans maybe have it the
[33:17] very worst because uh the USD will be
[33:19] the last to fall and um they basically
[33:24] export the inflation uh to the rest of
[33:27] the world
[33:28] this Petro dollar regime is uh I would
[33:31] say very important to the
[33:33] US and uh so the hyperbitcoinization
[33:36] will happen in stages and the first
[33:40] countries or societies to to adopt
[33:43] Bitcoin are those that have basically
[33:45] nothing to lose now we've seen that with
[33:47] uh Salvador uh which was a dollarized
[33:50] country they didn't have their own uh
[33:52] like monetary sovereignty they didn't
[33:55] have their own uh Central Bank their own
[33:57] money inter so there's nothing to lose
[34:00] basically uh the African countries uh
[34:04] are in a similar position uh Surinam is
[34:07] in a similar position I'm very
[34:09] optimistic about Surinam with the
[34:12] presidential candidate Maya parb they
[34:14] have the election next year and she's a
[34:16] hardcore bitcoiner uh so that might be
[34:18] the next country to adop bitcoin as a
[34:21] legal tender uh we have seen in Bhutan
[34:24] uh mining Bitcoin heavily in recent
[34:27] years so these smaller countries that
[34:30] don't really have this uh monetary
[34:33] privilege
[34:34] uh they are The Logical Stepping Stones
[34:38] to hyperbitcoinization
[34:40] so uh hyperbitcoinization in the first
[34:43] phase will be mostly about the global
[34:45] South I believe and we can see in uh in
[34:50] Africa which I have some experience with
[34:52] that explaining Bitcoin is uh in some
[34:55] ways much easier to Ordinary People than
[34:59] in the western world because um these
[35:03] people don't need convincing that Fiat
[35:04] money sucks uh they understand it very
[35:08] naturally because they've been living
[35:10] that their whole their whole life uh the
[35:14] payment rails usually don't work uh a
[35:17] lot of times they don't have any access
[35:19] to uh to bank account or to financial
[35:22] services to mortgages to uh to like the
[35:27] classical
[35:28] Fiat Investments like the stock market
[35:31] um they suffer from double digit
[35:34] inflation for uh years and years and
[35:37] decades and decades you have the CFA uh
[35:40] system in Central and West Africa that's
[35:43] the colonial Frank uh where I believe
[35:46] it's around 14 countries that have their
[35:49] monetary regime still managed by France
[35:52] so zero Financial or monetary
[35:55] sovereignty there and it's a very
[35:57] exploit ative regime uh I recommend the
[35:59] listeners to uh search for the article
[36:03] by Alex gladin fighting monetary
[36:05] colonialism with open source code uh
[36:07] it's about the CFA regime in
[36:10] Africa uh so uh yeah hyperbitcoinization
[36:15] um is is a huge opportunity for these
[36:19] unprivileged places and unprivileged uh
[36:23] part of the human population which is
[36:25] actually the majority of the
[36:28] uh on on the earth to um sort of reap
[36:34] frog into a much better much more
[36:36] civilized system that just doesn't
[36:37] exploit them that doesn't steal from
[36:39] them uh yeah so uh that's that's also
[36:43] why I like working on Treasure Academy
[36:46] as such as much yeah this this is the
[36:48] article thank you um because
[36:53] uh because um it's much easier it's much
[36:57] easier to uh bring people to Bitcoin in
[37:00] places where there is no alternative to
[37:03] bitcoin everything else sucks and
[37:05] everything else doesn't work or is
[37:08] trying to steal from people to exploit
[37:10] them um so Bitcoin uh there there's a
[37:15] beautiful saying by Obin vosu is's the
[37:18] founder of fedi uh Africa needs Bitcoin
[37:21] and Bitcoin needs Africa uh Bitcoin
[37:23] needs to succeed in Africa in the places
[37:26] where uh
[37:28] uh you know the internet coverage isn't
[37:30] as uh as as good uh the financial
[37:33] literacy isn't as good uh but these
[37:36] people need it the most uh so uh I'm
[37:39] really excited that uh there's African
[37:42] developers there's African educational
[37:44] programs like brust Builders there's uh
[37:48] Africans building tools for Africans
[37:50] like uh machura where you can use
[37:53] lightning network over feature
[37:55] phones uh there's African Bitcoin
[37:59] conferences uh the afro Bitcoin and
[38:01] adopting Bitcoin Cape
[38:03] Town uh and yeah a lot of stuff has been
[38:06] happening in Africa in the past several
[38:08] years um not that people know about it
[38:12] yet I would say uh but what I see is
[38:16] just an ex exponential growth because uh
[38:20] the environment is really ripe for
[38:22] Bitcoin
[38:24] adoption I love that a lot is there I I
[38:28] often see in countries like Argentina or
[38:31] turkey where the inflation is higher uh
[38:33] that they also often flee to the US
[38:36] dollar and and do better feeld currency
[38:38] is that in Africa to the case or is is
[38:42] the this those bman R is not that good
[38:45] yeah yeah that's uh definitely what's
[38:47] happening uh yeah to be realistic uh
[38:50] there is Bitcoin adoption in Africa and
[38:53] South America but there's also like a
[38:56] huge stable coin adoption
[38:58] so uh yeah the global South is
[39:01] definitely hungry for USD for dollars uh
[39:04] but the conventional uh banking systems
[39:08] are not really able to satisfy that
[39:11] demand so a lot of countries in Africa
[39:13] have just uh US Dollar Cash which um has
[39:17] its issues so
[39:20] um that's one of the reasons why uh
[39:23] tether is one of the most successful
[39:26] companies in the world right now in
[39:27] terms of their profitability per uh the
[39:30] number of employees I believe it's one
[39:32] of the one of the most successful
[39:34] companies ever and that's because uh uh
[39:38] Africa and South America are really
[39:40] hungry for dollars and uh that there is
[39:44] like an like a euro dollar that doesn't
[39:46] need any banking system it's just a
[39:48] digital euro dollar so euro dollar euro
[39:51] dollar is like a dollar outside of the
[39:53] American banking
[39:54] system uh but like before that before
[39:57] stable coins you still needed some uh
[40:00] conventional Bank to access the USD
[40:02] accounts with the stable coins like the
[40:05] you have the option to hold on to like a
[40:09] synthetic dollar just with your phone so
[40:13] uh yeah we see that quite a lot uh in
[40:16] the global South and I'm also happy that
[40:19] there are um alternative takes on like
[40:23] the stablecoin product uh like blink
[40:27] that's uh the blink wallet used to be
[40:29] called Bitcoin Beach wallet uh they have
[40:33] U an Innovative approach how to get like
[40:36] the
[40:37] USD uh denomination uh with just Bitcoin
[40:41] it's called stable sets and uh I think
[40:45] it's U it's a little bit more Allegent
[40:48] than holding like a specific token uh
[40:51] that represents the dollar value like
[40:54] USD so stable sets it's uh
[40:57] what I usually recommend if somebody
[40:59] wants to have like the exposure to the
[41:02] dollar or wants to hatch the Bitcoin
[41:04] into the dollar value then the blink
[41:06] wallet with its stable sets uh feature I
[41:09] think that's the way to go oh really
[41:12] cool I never heard about that I I heard
[41:13] about Blink before but I never heard
[41:15] about that feature do you see kind of
[41:19] stable coins as a as a bridge to the to
[41:22] theit bitcoin standard as a like a as a
[41:26] gateway
[41:27] to the to the actual
[41:29] thing yeah possibly um because if you
[41:33] use stable coins um you basically have
[41:37] everything in terms of uh apps and ux to
[41:42] get onto
[41:43] Bitcoin uh you just need to make the
[41:46] final leap to accepting uh the
[41:49] short-term volatility which um is just
[41:52] the price we pay the price we pay for uh
[41:56] long-term appreciation and like The
[41:59] Sovereign Financial sovereignty because
[42:01] like usdt or stable sets it's still just
[42:04] Fiat it's a it's a digital Fiat but uh
[42:08] it will still rob you over the long
[42:11] term uh What uh Bitcoin doesn't
[42:15] do uh so yeah hopefully it is like a
[42:19] gateway drug to
[42:21] bitcoin
[42:22] um and yeah I believe um in the long
[42:27] term it might be the case that people
[42:30] use uh stable coins or stable sets uh
[42:34] for like their short-term needs but uh
[42:36] understand that for long-term savings if
[42:39] they have the capability to build some
[42:42] long-term savings and that's a big part
[42:44] of us as Bitcoin Educators to uh teach
[42:48] like the financial literacy so that they
[42:50] will uh put away the extra purchasing
[42:54] power into Bitcoin
[42:57] I love that a lot yeah it's I think I
[42:59] think we we will get there um one thing
[43:03] that is I think like besides the
[43:06] regulatory framework um like if I could
[43:09] now spend uh Bitcoin normally everywhere
[43:13] without paying capital gains tax I think
[43:15] that's one thing that that really holds
[43:17] a lot of people off but the second thing
[43:20] might be volatility where you can play
[43:22] this game of like having 99% of your
[43:26] wealth in Bitcoin but like having 1% of
[43:29] stable uh thing where you can pay with
[43:32] things in in there uh and with that not
[43:35] touching the Bitcoin it might be
[43:37] interesting but I think once we get to a
[43:40] state where you can freely spend your
[43:43] Bitcoin Regulatory and it's accepted
[43:45] everywhere uh and then the volatility
[43:48] maybe goes down that then I think we
[43:50] really go hardcore on the medium of
[43:52] exchange um uh phase uh do do you where
[43:57] do you think what do you think needs to
[43:59] happen to to get there is like the the
[44:01] regulatory framework or the volatility
[44:03] or is there something else that that you
[44:05] looking forward to uh Bitcoin
[44:07] accelerating from like store of value to
[44:08] the next stage of of medium
[44:11] exchange yeah again really depends where
[44:14] you look in the world uh so yeah us
[44:17] Europe uh store of value is uh like the
[44:21] the the use case number one because you
[44:23] don't actually need Bitcoin as such for
[44:27] the medium of exchange we have Apple pay
[44:29] Google pay we have uh debit credit cards
[44:33] in Czech Republic we uh already have
[44:35] like uh zero fee instant Bank transfers
[44:39] if you transfer in between check Banks
[44:42] so uh it's as fast as as a liink network
[44:46] which is really amazing that the banking
[44:48] system finally pulled that off uh so
[44:51] yeah uh then it's a it's uh it's a tough
[44:54] case to make uh if you educate like like
[44:57] like check middle class kind of uh
[45:00] people that they should pay in Bitcoin
[45:02] because it doesn't really serve any use
[45:04] case for them so so store of value is uh
[45:07] use case number one of
[45:08] course um in uh in Africa in South
[45:13] America uh and places like that it's the
[45:16] other way around you need uh Bitcoin or
[45:19] you need something as a medium of
[45:21] exchange so and you know uh the the
[45:25] value of transaction is so low and the
[45:29] uh tax authorities are so ineffective
[45:32] that people don't usually uh have this
[45:35] issue that they need to uh they they
[45:40] need to declare like the $ five uh daily
[45:43] spending or something like that so it's
[45:45] mostly this debate about uh how to uh
[45:50] use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and
[45:52] how to change this tax treatment that's
[45:54] really like a western problem and yeah
[45:57] it will definitely help uh sure uh and
[46:01] even in the western world uh Bitcoin has
[46:06] a very good uh use case as a crossborder
[46:09] transaction mechanism because it's still
[46:13] not easy to get uh money from Europe to
[46:16] us and and back or from Europe to China
[46:20] uh and so uh like crossb transactions
[46:23] are still an issue uh and it's not a
[46:27] technical issue it's it's a regulatory
[46:29] issue you need to declare everything and
[46:32] still your transactions can be frozen so
[46:35] I know like uh some businessmen that
[46:37] prefer Bitcoin even like in our part of
[46:41] world because it's just easier and it
[46:43] always works without any any hassle so
[46:47] yeah I mean uh it's good if um the
[46:51] regulatory environment
[46:53] improves um but if it doesn't
[46:57] still we will people will prefer Bitcoin
[47:01] uh as a store of value because Fiat will
[47:04] always degrade and it will accelerate in
[47:06] its uh in its uh
[47:09] degradation we see that in the US where
[47:11] the dep to GDP is
[47:14] 120% uh and the deficits are over 1
[47:18] trillion now annually which simply means
[47:22] that the uh zero that the interest rates
[47:24] need to be around zero so that the state
[47:28] and uh everybody else doesn't go
[47:30] bankrupt with uh like servicing this
[47:33] depbt so when the interest rates are
[47:36] near zero that means uh more uh currency
[47:40] units will come into circulation and the
[47:42] purchasing power will erode and people
[47:45] will look for Alternatives and Bitcoin
[47:48] is just such
[47:50] U such an obvious alternative that
[47:54] people like as I said the loss of econ
[47:56] iics will apply in the end even if you
[47:59] don't use Bitcoin as a medium of
[48:01] exchange it's like just using Bitcoin as
[48:05] a store of value in our part of world is
[48:07] I would say enough for it to
[48:09] succeed I think I think so too like it
[48:12] it is the the the thing how we vote like
[48:16] if if everyone starts like as I myself
[48:18] like I have 100% of my network
[48:20] completely in Bitcoin uh I only hold a
[48:23] little bit in in fear and usually like I
[48:25] play the the play a game of like I have
[48:27] a uh 10K credit line that I can use
[48:31] whenever I want and can pay whenever I
[48:32] want and the way I do it I try to keep
[48:35] it as at zero as much as possible and if
[48:38] I need payment I just like get a little
[48:40] bit in depth uh and then with the next
[48:42] salary or next payment in comes in I
[48:44] just like pay it off so I'm like
[48:46] literally always aiming for exactly 100%
[48:48] in Bitcoin uh to try to get an
[48:51] interesting Bitcoin standard and with
[48:54] that I never have to sell my Bitcoin uh
[48:56] but I'm was like maximum exposed to
[48:59] bitcoin as possible without getting
[49:01] crazy with leverage or something like
[49:02] that because I'm not I'm not a friend of
[49:04] that even though it can be very uh good
[49:07] strategy um the last segment I want to
[49:10] go in with you is what do you think is
[49:13] the the most important aspect of Bitcoin
[49:16] and is there something that uh you would
[49:18] change or you see that we might need a
[49:21] change in in the
[49:23] future yeah um so I think the most
[49:27] important aspect of Bitcoin is uh the
[49:29] monetary policy or the lack of any uh
[49:33] like let's say policy it's an it's a
[49:35] monetary algorithm where uh we'll have
[49:39] the 21 million limit in the end and uh
[49:43] that's the very Foundation of Bitcoin at
[49:46] The credibility of that monetary policy
[49:48] uh par L and gradually then suddenly
[49:51] wrote an very good article not sure if
[49:54] I'll remember the title of the series or
[49:57] the whole book is really amazing and uh
[50:00] he just he makes the argument for why
[50:04] the credibility of bitcoin's 21
[50:07] million is the most important aspect of
[50:11] Bitcoin everything else basically comes
[50:13] from that so yeah that's the most
[50:16] important uh we can never touch that I
[50:18] don't think there will be proposals of
[50:20] course I believe like in two or three
[50:22] hallings we will have uh serious
[50:25] proposals to change the monetary policy
[50:28] but it will never succeed because it's
[50:30] such an ingrained feature and again it's
[50:34] uh it touches on the very um incentives
[50:38] of uh everybody who holds Bitcoin or who
[50:41] earns Bitcoin that this monetary policy
[50:43] can never be changed it will will never
[50:45] be changed um and everything everything
[50:49] else follows from that everything
[50:51] competes to this monetary policy in
[50:54] terms of uh stort of value instruments
[50:58] so gold competes with that stocks bonds
[51:01] Fiat currencies altcoins everything
[51:04] competes with Bitcoins 21 million and
[51:08] nobody can beat Bitcoin in that because
[51:12] it has the most credible monetary policy
[51:15] that grows even more credible with every
[51:18] passing year and uh uh yeah the
[51:22] worldwide adoption even ETFs reinforce
[51:25] it uh adoption at all scales basically
[51:29] reinforce this monetary policy and this
[51:31] credibility so yeah that's also why I'm
[51:34] so optimistic about Bitcoin and why it
[51:36] will succeed because uh the incentives
[51:39] with Bitcoin are so well aligned with uh
[51:42] what the mankind is and what we need uh
[51:46] even like unconsciously that's there's
[51:50] no other
[51:50] way it's it's it's so great do do you
[51:53] think the that strong monetary policy
[51:56] and that like the hard cap of 21 million
[51:59] or anything like really C to that is
[52:02] could that ever be questioned is that
[52:04] ever from like uh that that can be
[52:07] question or like what has to happen that
[52:09] something fundamental like that could
[52:12] could be changed obviously that is
[52:13] always the event of a hard Fork but that
[52:15] probably will not successful yeah it was
[52:18] and will be questioned um definitely by
[52:21] two uh different types of uh people the
[52:27] first is uh like the Fiat economists the
[52:29] mainstream economists who uh strongly
[52:31] believe that you need some kind of uh
[52:34] monetary and price inflation to for
[52:37] economy to work properly uh I believe
[52:40] this has been disproved by uh Mis ha and
[52:43] the austrians long time ago it's just uh
[52:47] just nonsense so anybody can read up
[52:49] those arguments uh from m h rodar and
[52:54] such uh and that's precedes Bitcoin even
[52:57] so uh and even it's disproved by history
[53:01] by uh uh let's say 19th century America
[53:05] for example being the most prosperous
[53:07] time under the gold standard that wasn't
[53:10] debased uh so that's one group of people
[53:13] the Fiat economists but we don't have to
[53:15] pay too much attention to them because
[53:17] uh they have been disproved time and
[53:19] time again the second group uh is let's
[53:23] say the security budget
[53:27] uh type of people that are concerned
[53:29] about the so-called security budget
[53:32] which uh is the idea that uh as this
[53:35] Bitcoin subsidy tapers off um and we
[53:38] approach uh the zero Bitcoin per new
[53:42] Mind Block uh as a Bitcoin
[53:44] subsidy uh that the fees that the
[53:47] transaction fees simply won't be enough
[53:49] and Bitcoin will not be uh will not be
[53:54] uh safe and we will see 51% attacks and
[53:58] double spend attempts and such uh I
[54:01] would say that's probably a valid
[54:04] concern uh but the answer my answer to
[54:08] that is uh basically what what Satoshi
[54:12] said in 20 years there's either going to
[54:14] be plenty of transactions or there's
[54:16] going to be zero so if Bitcoin is
[54:19] successful uh and its success comes from
[54:22] this 21 million limit then people will
[54:26] use it and if people will use it the
[54:28] block space is so limited uh and that's
[54:32] it's a it's a good thing we didn't go
[54:34] like The Bash route with expanding the
[54:37] block space because we need that to be
[54:39] scarce uh precisely to have uh
[54:41] sufficient fee pressure to fill the
[54:44] so-called security budget so if Bitcoin
[54:47] is widely used uh if we go uh if you
[54:51] continue this hyperbitcoinization
[54:53] path uh which I believe is actually
[54:56] happening then there will not be any
[54:59] security budget uh concern
[55:02] because uh the onchain fees will be
[55:05] sufficient and we can debate what it
[55:08] means but it's going to be just uh
[55:11] plenty I would say and which means the
[55:13] onchain transaction fees are going to be
[55:16] quite huge I believe um but that's fine
[55:19] you you know uh the the block space the
[55:22] onent train section uh kind of uh moving
[55:26] money around it's more like Swift or uh
[55:29] AC it's these like uh huge uh settlement
[55:34] layers it's not something to pay coffee
[55:37] with that's why we have lightning
[55:39] network ecash uh Fint uh liquid we don't
[55:43] know yet but there there's going to be a
[55:45] solution for uh microtransactions but
[55:48] it's not it's not on chain of course
[55:51] absolutely yeah I think
[55:53] security the security thing is like
[55:57] already you can already see it a little
[55:59] bit and I think we will never run in a
[56:02] security budget problem and uh the
[56:04] Bitcoin mining algorithm even like with
[56:06] the the difficulty adjustment all those
[56:07] things as you also mentioned the other
[56:09] things uh it's it's it's quite obvious
[56:12] that it it will work and it's it's it's
[56:14] an extremely elegent solution and I
[56:17] think like if if you don't get it to a
[56:19] full extent it's it's mostly because you
[56:21] didn't study the the technical parts and
[56:24] the uh security parts of Bitcoin deep
[56:28] enough I I see that question a lot with
[56:30] with beginners that I know but how how
[56:33] can they even get a buchet when uh the
[56:36] the when the last Bitcoin is mined and
[56:39] most people like that's just like most
[56:42] people don't even know that there
[56:44] there's also transaction fees and the
[56:46] miners also get money from that so like
[56:48] I think we just have to do a really good
[56:51] uh work in educating people and I think
[56:53] you're doing an amazing part in that
[56:55] with with book with Academy I love what
[56:57] you're doing there so I think we we need
[56:59] more education and we need more
[57:01] Educators uh I I always call them like
[57:03] the digital soldiers for for Bitcoin
[57:06] education so I think we we need as many
[57:09] as
[57:10] possible uh and and I I hope we can push
[57:13] towards that really
[57:15] cool yeah really cool thank you um then
[57:18] we come to the tin uh there the first
[57:20] question of the end routine uh of two
[57:22] questions is always the same question
[57:24] what can we learn from you besides
[57:27] Bitcoin well yeah that's a that's a
[57:29] great one uh so I've become a sort of a
[57:33] stereotypical bitcoiner in that um I
[57:38] discovered the carnivore diet uh and it
[57:41] just helped me uh so much I used to have
[57:43] like a chronic eczema skin problem for
[57:46] 20 years and when I got rid of seed oils
[57:49] and started to go like the animal based
[57:51] diet uh it basically disappeared which
[57:54] is amazing I never thought that was
[57:56] possible and no doctor would ever
[57:58] recommend a change in a diet so uh it's
[58:01] really surprising how broken the the
[58:05] medical system actually is even in like
[58:07] our part of world uh so um yeah I
[58:11] recommend like uh trying that approach
[58:15] the animal based carnivore Paul saladino
[58:17] is is a sort of my hero in that and his
[58:20] book The carnivore code it's very much
[58:22] worth reading and also recently I
[58:25] discovered like the baref food uh bare
[58:28] food style like of wearing the bare food
[58:31] shoes or going really bare food on on
[58:33] grass in the forest and it really like
[58:36] uh helps um like move you forward uh in
[58:41] terms of your health so these are the
[58:43] two non-bitcoin things but we see quite
[58:46] a lot of alignment between bitcoiners
[58:49] and these approaches and I think uh it's
[58:53] it's a logical progression because
[58:55] bitcoiners are looking for the truth no
[58:57] matter what the mainstream narratives
[58:59] are and it seems to Simply Be TR that we
[59:04] work better with an animal based diet
[59:07] and uh well like providing some freedom
[59:11] to our feet so uh I uh that's two points
[59:14] of advice I have for people that want to
[59:17] try it I am I I fully accept there are
[59:20] people that for ethical reasons don't
[59:22] want to try the animal based diet that's
[59:23] fine but uh there might be con quences
[59:26] in terms of personal health interesting
[59:28] just really cool uh I like how often um
[59:33] the with the question a lot of family
[59:35] comes up but also like a diet uh uh and
[59:39] things that I think but the Barefoot
[59:41] actually never came up and I was shocked
[59:43] by it never coming up because I know
[59:44] it's a big one in the Bitcoin Community
[59:47] I also know some some friends that that
[59:49] are really big on that and it's it's an
[59:51] amazing experience like going going with
[59:54] your feet outside touching grass and I
[59:56] love I love that a lot really cool then
[59:59] yeah thank you so much uh we have
[60:00] another end routine uh where the
[60:02] previous guest is asking a question for
[60:04] the next guest uh without knowing who
[60:06] the next guest actually is and your
[60:08] question is an interesting one uh what
[60:10] is one question that you have never been
[60:12] asked before you wish you were asked uh
[60:15] and what is the answer to
[60:16] that uh I've been asked so many
[60:20] questions so it's hard to come up with
[60:23] one um
[60:26] yeah I imagine this takes some time for
[60:28] people to
[60:29] answer I think so too
[60:32] yeah I've never been asked maybe uh
[60:36] where Surinam is because nobody knows
[60:40] like uh about that little country and I
[60:43] discovered that country just recently
[60:45] and I think that's really beautiful
[60:46] about Bitcoin that you get connected
[60:49] with people from a totally different uh
[60:54] environment um so I now know that
[60:57] Surinam lies in the in the north of
[60:59] South America and uh their their
[61:03] official language is Dutch which uh was
[61:06] so mindblowing to
[61:08] me uh so yeah I recommend uh the
[61:12] listeners to look up Surinam and their
[61:15] presidential candidate Maya
[61:17] parh or sorry if I buture the
[61:20] pronunciation
[61:21] there uh and uh I really hope I I think
[61:27] that's the presidential race to watch
[61:30] not the American one but this one in
[61:33] Surinam in a tiny country nobody heard
[61:35] of so yeah uh that's that's one question
[61:39] I uh I would like uh to be ask maybe
[61:42] before because it's it looks like a
[61:44] lovely country I hope I will get a
[61:46] chance to visit it sometimes absolutely
[61:49] and for everyone that is uh curious
[61:51] about Surinam or Maya I have a podcast
[61:54] actually uh made a podcast with her like
[61:57] I think five months ago or something
[61:58] like that where we talked in the depth
[62:01] actually about Surinam what the country
[62:03] is what the country why the country is
[62:05] special and also uh what her involvement
[62:10] in politics were what she tries with
[62:12] Bitcoin and all the scandals around
[62:16] Surinam uh so I highly recommend people
[62:18] just like search Surinam or Maya bahi
[62:23] you you will find it easily on the
[62:25] channel and the other interviews also
[62:26] really good ones I really uh I'm I will
[62:29] meet her again in El Salvador in a month
[62:33] and we will probably make a second round
[62:35] of the podcast uh because it has been an
[62:38] amazing one and there were too many
[62:40] topics left out and we like let's do a
[62:42] second round of that uh so I like uh her
[62:46] and her Mission and she's really a
[62:48] bitcoiner and obviously she's way more
[62:51] be a Bitcoin as Donald Trump but but but
[62:55] the us obviously um is a little bigger
[63:00] than
[63:01] seram yeah but yeah really really cool
[63:04] thank you so much y for being on on the
[63:06] show uh before I let you go where can
[63:08] people find you ask your questions and
[63:10] read more about you yeah so uh I'm on
[63:13] Twitter or x uh as my name Yosef Chek uh
[63:18] so very easy to
[63:20] find and I'm also on um on Noster the
[63:25] same handle or my npop is I believe
[63:29] published in my Twitter bio so uh these
[63:32] these two places are the best really
[63:34] cool thank you so much for taking the
[63:36] time also thank you so much for everyone
[63:38] that is watching and listening for
[63:39] joining us today as always I'll be back
