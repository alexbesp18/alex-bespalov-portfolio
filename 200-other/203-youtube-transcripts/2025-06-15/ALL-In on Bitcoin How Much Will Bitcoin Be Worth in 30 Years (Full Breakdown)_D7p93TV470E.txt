[00:00] If you truly want fiat to accelerate and
[00:02] disappear, doing those kinds of things
[00:05] just accelerates it. I'm going to
[00:06] negotiate in the worthless fiat currency
[00:09] price because $5,000 today not only goes
[00:12] down in purchasing power, the Bitcoin
[00:14] actually appreciate. I really didn't
[00:16] know a lot about Bitcoin. When I decided
[00:18] I'm going all in, I just knew that the
[00:19] dollar was broken. I knew that I would
[00:21] feel better, sleep better at night
[00:23] regardless of the volatility dollar
[00:25] amount because I knew the dollar was
[00:26] worthless. The fact is I'm not going to
[00:29] lose over the next 30 years 90% of my
[00:32] energy and time. Life is too short.
[00:34] Bitcoin gave me just enough cushion to
[00:37] make that switch and feel that way to be
[00:39] able to decide how I spend my time, what
[00:41] I do, who I do it with, where I go. That
[00:44] sovereignty, that feeling that you
[00:46] control your monetary financial destiny
[00:49] is very rewarding. It's scary cuz you
[00:51] know you have to take responsibility,
[00:53] but who is it that said responsibility
[00:54] is freedom? It's not just uh plug in
[00:57] miners into power and print magic
[00:59] internet money, right? It's gotten a
[01:01] little more complicated than that now.
[01:04] [Music]
[01:07] Hi, David. How are you doing? Uh
[01:08] anything fine on your end there. Hey, uh
[01:10] good. Um again, just to tell you
[01:13] personally, you know, been following you
[01:14] for a long time. Love your work. Um
[01:17] haven't had a chance to meet you in
[01:18] person. Um, I think maybe we've been at
[01:20] a couple of the same events, but you
[01:22] know, just never got to connect
[01:23] officially. But, uh, thanks very much
[01:25] for for reaching out. Love what you do.
[01:27] And, um, the more, you know, yeah, it
[01:31] can get a little daunting, but I'm a
[01:32] firm believer that we need more Bitcoin
[01:34] education, more podcasts, more videos,
[01:37] more content. uh you know if it wasn't
[01:40] for the uh stuff that you and you know
[01:43] Nico simply Bitcoin and uh Breedlove and
[01:47] BTC Sessions you know if it wasn't for
[01:50] your content um the content creators I
[01:53] wouldn't know how to self-custody right
[01:55] I wouldn't know how to set up a a
[01:57] hardware wallet I'm a hardware guy but
[01:59] mostly on the infrastructure side so um
[02:02] whether it's finance or actual you know
[02:05] the technical side of the chain and the
[02:07] work. Uh, you know, I just really
[02:09] appreciate everything you guys do. So,
[02:11] thank you very much for that.
[02:13] Absolutely. Thank you so much. That's
[02:14] very sweet of you. It it's it's very
[02:17] important the education side of things.
[02:18] And uh some people say like, "Oh,
[02:20] there's too much already." I I honestly
[02:23] think and I encourage actually everyone
[02:25] on my podcast that um uh comes on here
[02:29] and he has no like no presence online
[02:34] because I have a few people I think like
[02:36] probably like 50 to 60 actually like
[02:38] quite a quite some amount of people that
[02:40] have never been on any podcast before.
[02:42] So they kind of got started with mine.
[02:45] Um, I always encourage them to just get
[02:48] started with something like if you don't
[02:51] have video, you can write something like
[02:54] education comes in so many different
[02:55] forms. You don't have to have a YouTube
[02:57] channel or anything like that. Um,
[02:59] because maybe you're not comfortable
[03:00] sharing your face. You can just have a
[03:03] anonymous account and and write stuff
[03:05] down. Like there's no exa there's no
[03:08] excuse for not educating other people.
[03:11] Yeah. Yeah. And I I was thinking the
[03:13] other day just someone asked me uh you
[03:16] know what kept me in Bitcoin, right?
[03:21] Because I did not have just there was
[03:23] some success right off the bat. I was
[03:25] working with a company that was already
[03:26] established. So that made it easy. Um
[03:29] but when I came in I wasn't even a
[03:30] Bitcoiner, right? They just assumed
[03:32] because I was working with some
[03:33] Bitcoiners through this company that I
[03:35] already knew everything. Um, it was
[03:37] really those people that orangepilled me
[03:40] and it had nothing to do with, you know,
[03:43] they they didn't target me and say,
[03:44] "Hey, Dave's not a Bitcoiner. Let's go
[03:46] work on him, right? Let's orange pill
[03:48] him." It was just them being them. And
[03:51] so a couple years ago when I thought
[03:53] about taking a a job outside and going
[03:57] back to kind of a nine-to-five kind of
[03:59] traditional uh job, the reason I turned
[04:02] it down, I didn't even have like a
[04:04] specific prospect ready to go in
[04:06] Bitcoin, another project to work on or
[04:07] anything. So it was like I the thing
[04:11] that made me turn it down was the
[04:12] Bitcoiners I was working with. U you
[04:15] know, Bitcoiners are the best part about
[04:17] Bitcoin. It's it's fantastic. It's an
[04:20] amazing invention, discovery, whichever
[04:22] you know you choose to argue on that
[04:25] side. But um really it's a tool and the
[04:29] Bitcoiners are the ones that are
[04:31] actually using it to do amazing things
[04:34] and so it's what you actually do with it
[04:36] that uh that is so important and the
[04:38] freedom that it gives you. So and and
[04:40] that comes specifically through
[04:42] Bitcoiners and and nothing else. So
[04:45] absolutely I could couldn't agree more.
[04:47] Uh is there something um that you're
[04:50] seeing like oh there's still a lot of
[04:53] work to do we have to do in in in the
[04:54] Bitcoin education sphere? Anything
[04:57] specific that you that you're looking at
[04:58] or is it some is it just we we have to
[05:01] get more of of of all of it? So well
[05:05] more of all of it is the easy answer. Um
[05:07] but if you dig it dig down into it I
[05:09] think there's kind of maybe three
[05:10] tenants that you should focus on. Um my
[05:14] goal is uh on the hardware side, on the
[05:18] network side, right? Um it's an
[05:20] education of miners on uh you know how
[05:23] the pools work, how templates work um
[05:25] and that you can actually you know take
[05:28] a hold of it. Ocean's done some
[05:30] interesting things with that uh
[05:32] especially the new datam you know uh
[05:34] program. So it gives you more self-
[05:37] sovereignty uh on the mining side is
[05:40] very important to me. That's just an
[05:41] education reason. And it's not just uh
[05:44] you know plug in miners into the into
[05:47] power and you know print magic internet
[05:49] money, right? It's gotten a little more
[05:50] complicated than that now. And um so
[05:53] that's one. Uh the second one is um just
[05:58] the overall general population in
[06:01] education, right? So like I love BTC
[06:03] sessions and what he does. Um, I had
[06:06] been working, believe it or not, I had
[06:08] been working in Bitcoin for probably a
[06:09] year and a half and had been stacking on
[06:10] exchanges before I realized, oh, this is
[06:14] not my Bitcoin, right? So, I I had I
[06:17] went through and found that's when I
[06:19] actually found him. Wasn't referred to
[06:21] him or anything. Just found him on
[06:23] YouTube by searching for um, you know,
[06:27] instructional videos. And I started at
[06:29] his very beginning and started kind of
[06:31] going through until I found what I
[06:32] needed. got a cold card, used his
[06:35] tutorials to get that set up, right? U
[06:38] that feeling is so freeing to the
[06:40] average person to understand that this
[06:42] is actually mine, right? It's like
[06:44] having uh cash in your, you know, shoved
[06:48] in your mattress at home as opposed to
[06:50] in the bank, only it's so much safer.
[06:52] It's so much more convenient. So that um
[06:55] sovereignty, that feeling that you
[06:57] control your monetary
[07:00] uh financial destiny is very rewarding.
[07:02] It's scary because you know you have to
[07:05] take responsibility, but taking that
[07:07] responsibility, who was it that said
[07:09] responsibility is freedom? I think it's
[07:11] might be Choco Willink or somebody that
[07:13] I read that said responsibility is
[07:15] freedom. Um or discipline is freedom,
[07:18] right? I think that's what he said. Um,
[07:20] so that's very important on that
[07:21] education side just so the more people
[07:23] that understand this uh the better all
[07:26] of the Bitcoin development in the entire
[07:28] ecosphere is going to be. Um, and then
[07:31] the uh my focus kind of the third is
[07:35] really
[07:36] just Bitcoiners are great at figuring
[07:39] out new things to do, how to do them,
[07:41] doing things that have never been done
[07:43] before, right? Uh and then you have a
[07:46] lot there's a lot of people that are out
[07:48] there from outside that are kind of
[07:50] bringing money and finance into the
[07:53] Bitcoin space. Uh but they're doing it
[07:56] on a massive level that's almost too
[07:59] big, right? like you all the pub codes
[08:02] that go public u you know whether they
[08:04] IPO or they go through a spa whatever
[08:05] the case may be um they have these these
[08:09] uh just massive organizations you know
[08:11] strategy right
[08:13] Micros all these people that are doing
[08:15] this um we need more what I'd call just
[08:20] family offices high net worth individual
[08:22] private equity to come into it and I'm
[08:24] starting to see that on the mining side
[08:26] the infrastructure side makes sense
[08:28] there's a lot of um uh accelerated
[08:31] depreciation people can take. So if
[08:33] you're worried about your tax burden,
[08:35] you can get into mining at a discount
[08:37] essentially, right? That's money that
[08:38] would go to uh the US
[08:41] government
[08:47] hardware. I think
[08:50] your recording has stopped for some
[08:52] reason.
[09:01] [Music]
[09:10] you. Am I there? Hey, Rob. Am I there?
[09:14] Oh, yeah. Yeah. I don't know what
[09:15] happened. Just got kicked off the
[09:16] network or something.
[09:20] Interesting. Yeah, it it it said it it
[09:22] stopped recording on your side, but
[09:24] yeah, it has sometimes it has hiccups.
[09:26] It's okay. Uh it's it's it's just uh
[09:29] I'll clue it together later. Google
[09:32] production, post-production. Um but uh
[09:36] so you're seeing all this. I want to
[09:38] bring in my focus for the last really 6
[09:40] months to a year has been bringing in
[09:42] private equity. Uh taking investors who
[09:45] want to be more vertical, maybe they
[09:47] even want to own the energy production
[09:49] up. um and uh walking them through the
[09:52] process, introducing them to the right
[09:54] uh people to help make that work. Um
[09:57] sometimes it's as simple as helping them
[09:59] find miners, but more often than that,
[10:01] it's helping them develop a site. So,
[10:03] we'll negotiate uh hosting agreements or
[10:06] joint ventures. Uh we'll go find power.
[10:10] Uh I'll we'll evaluate, you know, do we
[10:13] want to do air, do we want to do
[10:14] immersion, do we want to do hydro? um
[10:18] and just take a look at all of that and
[10:20] then uh I'll evaluate that with the
[10:22] investors and then we get a site set up
[10:24] and we get up and running. Um and uh
[10:27] those all of those things I think are
[10:30] very important to more decentralization
[10:33] of the network and making sure that we
[10:35] have more parties that have a say in uh
[10:39] the pools uh how we mine from an
[10:42] infrastructure, what type of energy we
[10:44] use, all of that should be evenly
[10:46] distributed and represented um to make
[10:50] sure
[10:51] that there's less single points of
[10:53] failure, right? uh there's always attack
[10:56] vectors that need to be uh that can be
[10:58] compromised, but the more spread out,
[11:01] not just the usage of Bitcoin and who
[11:04] uses it and how you and how you use it,
[11:06] but also on the mining side, what energy
[11:09] you use, where they're located, the size
[11:10] of the and scope of how they're mining,
[11:13] all of that plays a role in the uh in
[11:17] the success long-term success of the
[11:19] network.
[11:23] Do you think we currently have a kind of
[11:26] a problem with too much concentration at
[11:29] the mining pool level and and the
[11:32] templates? And you mentioned uh the the
[11:34] the ocean protocol in Ted.
[11:37] Um I I'm not as worried
[11:42] about not as worried about
[11:44] centralization maybe as a lot of others
[11:47] are uh itself. I'm I'm more worried
[11:50] about transparency. Um they the problem
[11:54] is a lack of transparency can lead to
[11:57] severe centralization. Um and vice
[12:00] versa, right? Uh
[12:02] so what I like about what Ocean is doing
[12:05] is for the first time I can
[12:08] know where my hash rate is going to. And
[12:13] I think this is this is kind of the key.
[12:17] So trying to think of an easy way to
[12:20] explain it, right?
[12:21] Um if if you consider the network to be
[12:25] like a body or the c, you know, maybe
[12:27] maybe uh the network itself is like a
[12:30] brain and a central nervous system,
[12:32] right? And it's built along the network
[12:34] and the bones and the structure is
[12:35] Bitcoin itself and the end users that
[12:38] use it, right? So we're moving Bitcoin
[12:40] from one area to another. The network,
[12:44] the central nervous system is what
[12:46] enables the signals to say, "Hey, we're
[12:48] going to take this over here and we're
[12:49] going to move it over here. We're going
[12:50] to do this work. We're going to move the
[12:52] body from here to here." Whatever the
[12:53] case may be. The hash rate is really the
[12:56] muscle that kind of allows that to
[12:58] happen, right? So, it's uh and up to
[13:01] this point um miners have just been
[13:04] providing the muscle and they haven't
[13:06] really concerned themselves. Well,
[13:08] that's not true. It's changing pretty
[13:10] rapidly, but in in the past it was just
[13:12] it was so new and the system was a
[13:15] little more rudimentary. So you would
[13:17] take and put your hash rate online, pick
[13:20] the pool that you think was most
[13:21] profitable as far as uh dollar, you
[13:24] know, amounts or currency goes and say
[13:27] this is where I'm going. And that was
[13:29] necessary because you're investing large
[13:31] amounts of money in a asset that had not
[13:34] yet proven itself. uh it was a very
[13:37] riskon asset and so if you couldn't
[13:41] handle the volatility you had to be as
[13:43] smart as you possibly could just with
[13:45] your bottom line what your costs and
[13:47] your P&L would be um and because it
[13:50] would just it could just completely put
[13:51] you under if you were overleveraged and
[13:53] we saw that happen a lot in the last
[13:55] three years three or four years um
[13:58] people would get overleveraged
[14:00] volatility would shake them loose they'd
[14:03] get margin called and and they'd be
[14:04] they'd be gone on right or out or they'd
[14:07] have to restructure whatever the case
[14:09] may be. Um now they're
[14:11] slowly these miners are taking a look at
[14:15] it and understanding that at the pool
[14:17] level we should be providing a lot more
[14:20] feedback as to how the muscles are used.
[14:23] Right? So it's like you had a nervous
[14:25] system that was one way sending to the
[14:27] muscle saying muscle move this way. But
[14:29] if I move this way and something's in
[14:31] the way and it stops my muscle or it's a
[14:34] problem, if I'm not feeding that back to
[14:36] my brain in the network, right, I can't
[14:39] improve the next time that I do that.
[14:42] this the transparency and the ability
[14:44] to, you know, and you've always have
[14:47] been able to to some degree,
[14:49] but Ocean's done a good job of making it
[14:52] readily available to the average minor
[14:54] uh even if they're not super technical,
[14:56] even if they're running a small uh a
[14:58] small operation to be able to manage how
[15:01] that muscle is used. And they get to
[15:04] they get to say they say, "Okay, let's
[15:06] move the arm over here." And then I'm a
[15:08] minor and I say, "No, no, no. There's a
[15:10] brick wall here. I'm not going to punch
[15:12] my fist into this brick wall. I want to
[15:15] include or exclude these kinds of
[15:17] transactions so I can go around that
[15:19] brick wall, right? It's kind of and it
[15:22] gives them much more control over how
[15:25] their muscle is used. And in my opinion,
[15:27] the more that's more of a consensus
[15:30] mechanism than just you know pools are
[15:32] right. that gives them uh if enough
[15:34] people 45 50% of the people decide hey
[15:38] we want to mine with this way we want to
[15:41] provide it for this okay um and the rest
[15:45] of it is spread out over a 100 different
[15:47] ways 100 different types of transactions
[15:49] etc um that gives us a much stronger
[15:53] consensus as to how
[15:55] uh what is and isn't included which
[15:59] ultimately I think um secures the to
[16:02] work for the masses outside of the
[16:04] actual mining side as well, right? So,
[16:06] it's a it's a challenge, but there's a
[16:09] lot of cool stuff happening with it.
[16:11] There's a big movement on the home
[16:13] mining side, you know, with the Bitax
[16:15] and and things like that. Uh Scott, I'm
[16:18] super jealous. Scott did a really good
[16:20] job with that. And um it's it was a
[16:23] brilliant move because it we're still
[16:25] getting the large scale stuff and mining
[16:27] and hash and network and and hash rate
[16:30] uh you know in these big pools and
[16:32] things. So blocks are, you
[16:35] know, blocks are consistently found,
[16:37] right? But at the same time, it further
[16:39] decentralizes it and taps into that
[16:41] original kind of cipher punk, you know,
[16:44] idea of, well, you know, I should be
[16:46] able to plug in this code and use my
[16:49] energy at home and use it however I want
[16:52] to. And so it we're we're getting the
[16:54] best of both worlds. Are they kind of
[16:55] lopsided right now? Yeah. But I think
[16:57] eventually those will kind of even out.
[16:59] that's part of, you know, a competitive
[17:02] capitalistic kind of uh business model
[17:05] and Bitcoin is nothing if not
[17:07] capitalistic. So,
[17:10] yeah, miners uh miners are super
[17:14] interesting. I had Scott on I had what
[17:17] uh want clue I think want clue is the is
[17:20] is the other part of it uh that is in in
[17:24] Bidex. Um, and they both talked about
[17:29] Bitco Bitex and the more I heard about
[17:32] it, the more I was like, "Oh, that
[17:34] that's so that's so brilliant. I I love
[17:36] that so much." Especially if you can
[17:39] plug it in and get like lightning
[17:41] payouts or anything like that. Like you
[17:43] because I think with Ocean, if you uh
[17:46] plug it in outside of the lightning
[17:48] payouts, I think you have to wait till
[17:49] the millions are torches till you get a
[17:51] payout if if I'm correct. Uh so uh
[17:55] mining payouts it that's really really
[17:57] cool to have and the the mining space
[18:00] just evolves so quickly. What do you
[18:03] kind of wait but uh one thing that I
[18:06] actually wanted to start with I think
[18:07] that's important for for people to to
[18:09] get your background. Um we already
[18:11] almost 20 minutes in but anyways I'll
[18:13] I'll get it now in um uh give the people
[18:16] a little bit of a background uh who you
[18:18] are and and what are you kind of doing
[18:20] in the Bitcoin space? Well, I mean in my
[18:22] as far as where I came from, um I've
[18:24] just kind of bounced around a different
[18:26] a bunch of different um kind of business
[18:28] development sales type positions with
[18:30] different companies um for about I did
[18:33] that for
[18:34] about 16 17 years. Um I've worked at
[18:38] large companies like Dell. Uh I've run
[18:41] my own companies uh doing like
[18:43] businessto business uh collections um
[18:46] which was an interesting uh interesting
[18:49] endeavor. Uh I worked with a startup, an
[18:52] infection control, infection prevention
[18:53] startup for a while. Um I really just
[18:57] like uh exciting, interesting projects,
[19:00] right? Things that are interesting that
[19:02] I hadn't done before. And uh during
[19:06] COVID, I had lost
[19:08] u a company uh had some weird things uh
[19:14] I guess regulatory things happen that
[19:16] knocked me out of my businessto business
[19:18] collections company. And so I lost that
[19:22] in
[19:24] March, April of 2019. And so and I had
[19:27] looked for a job but really hadn't found
[19:30] anything yet.
[19:32] Um and uh was really just kind of bored.
[19:35] And I and uh I looking back on it, I was
[19:38] just I wasn't willing to look for
[19:40] anything new. I just thought I needed to
[19:43] continue with the skills I had learned
[19:45] and and what I had done in the past and
[19:47] just rely on that being my age. You
[19:50] know, it's easy to make an assumption
[19:51] that you're like, "Hey, you're this far
[19:53] along in your career. You know, just
[19:55] stick with what you know. It's worked up
[19:56] to this point, right?" Um, but then it
[19:59] didn't work, right? Like nobody was
[20:00] calling me back. People thought I was uh
[20:04] too qualified. They were worried they
[20:05] were going to hire me and I was going to
[20:06] disappear. So, you know, when something
[20:08] else better came along, it was just like
[20:10] I just need something to do, right? Uh
[20:12] and then COVID hit and things were
[20:14] really difficult for a while and uh but
[20:17] that was the jar I needed. It made me uh
[20:20] I was just on YouTube most most days. I
[20:23] hadn't really I I had a little bit of
[20:24] Bitcoin, but I hadn't really discovered
[20:26] it. And then um I
[20:29] uh I just decided I wanted to build
[20:32] something or do something because I was
[20:34] so bored. I was like, I need to do
[20:35] something with my hands. And I have a
[20:38] koi pond in my backyard. So, I started
[20:40] learning about uh hydroponics,
[20:43] aquaculture, using a raised grow bed to,
[20:46] you know, to to grow food and things
[20:48] like that. And uh so I just started
[20:50] doing that and um it's it just led to an
[20:56] interesting series of events, right? My
[20:57] neighbor across the street asked about
[20:59] it. Um, it turns out he was the
[21:02] president or the CEO of Midas Immersion.
[21:05] Uh, they had just done their first deal
[21:06] with Riot, the publicly traded miner.
[21:09] So, I got into immersion cooling, went
[21:12] to work with him. Um, that led to me uh
[21:16] I did some things with them and then
[21:17] left and went out on my own and built a
[21:19] couple sites for some independent
[21:21] investors. I got to work on a couple of
[21:23] off-grid mining sites. Uh so I I kind of
[21:26] figured out learned about uh gas
[21:29] production and power or gas and power
[21:30] production and things like that. And so
[21:33] all of a sudden I was learning again,
[21:35] but it was literally that that one it it
[21:38] my aha moment was I'm really tired of
[21:41] sitting around my house doing nothing. I
[21:43] need to learn something and do something
[21:44] new that I've never done before. Um and
[21:47] I realized that was the catalyst that
[21:49] got me into this. It could have been
[21:50] Bitcoin. It could have been something
[21:52] completely different. But the problem is
[21:54] I had just locked myself into believing
[21:55] I couldn't learn anything or do anything
[21:57] new. I just needed to I was in a rut and
[22:00] I was just uh stuck there. So uh now
[22:05] it's like I I mean I want to talk to
[22:07] anybody and everybody who's working on
[22:08] anything who's come up with any idea at
[22:10] all uh and see if there's a way I can
[22:12] help. So if I can get involved and work
[22:14] with you, great. Even if I can't, let me
[22:17] know what you're doing and if I can help
[22:19] you find the right person, I'll help you
[22:20] find the right person. There's this um
[22:23] really great uh you know culture in
[22:27] Bitcoin of helping others especially
[22:31] those that you see working very hard who
[22:34] passionately believe in what they're
[22:35] doing and and you know they're genuine
[22:38] about what they're trying to accomplish.
[22:40] Uh you just want to help those people.
[22:42] Good people want to help those people.
[22:44] And so that is something that I was very
[22:47] um addicted to. And so a couple years
[22:50] ago, I didn't have a a project lined up.
[22:53] I wasn't sure what I was going to do.
[22:55] You know, the income stopped coming for
[22:56] a few months and I had a job offer to go
[22:59] back to kind of a traditional, you know,
[23:01] cubicle 9 toive sales job. I just
[23:05] couldn't do it. I was like, I I can't go
[23:07] back there. And so that's kind of where
[23:09] I am now. I've just I try to learn a
[23:12] little bit about every single thing I
[23:14] do, just enough to be knowledgeable and
[23:16] to make good decisions. and uh and then
[23:19] help bring all of the puzzle pieces
[23:20] together to get a site up and running or
[23:23] to make a new business happen or
[23:24] whatever the case may be.
[23:28] It's it's so funny when you talk to
[23:30] Bitcoiners, more more of them just
[23:32] become unemployable in the in the in the
[23:34] in the normal space of of of of working
[23:37] where most like let's say 80 90% of
[23:40] people work. They're like I'm not going
[23:43] back there like why should I do that?
[23:45] It's also so fun the coincidence to see
[23:47] in those Bitcoin stories. And I and I
[23:50] sometimes feel like it's so easy not to
[23:53] see Bitcoin. It's so easy to dismiss it
[23:56] as, oh, it uses too much energy or
[23:58] dismiss it as, oh, it it it won't work
[24:01] because of that and that and that
[24:02] because you always hear that in the
[24:04] mainstream media and there are so many
[24:06] people that doesn't know Bitcoin. But
[24:08] there's this one moment where you had an
[24:11] open mind and all of the sudden you
[24:12] discovered Bitcoin and you actually
[24:14] researched and like oh like it's
[24:16] actually a good idea. And I I think most
[24:19] Bitcoiners come through those moments. I
[24:21] mean there are some very early OGs that
[24:25] just waited for something like that. But
[24:27] the majority of them has really grateful
[24:30] and uh that they discovered Bitcoin and
[24:33] were open to the the idea. It's really
[24:36] cool. I mean I
[24:39] I I hear people say it's like, you know,
[24:41] Bitcoin saved me or Bitcoin saved my
[24:43] life or or whatever.
[24:45] And that's a that's probably about 90%
[24:49] true, right? It uh no matter who says
[24:51] what.
[24:53] Uh it's uh our our lives are so wrapped
[24:57] financially around money just because it
[25:00] is our medium of exchange. It's the way
[25:02] we get the things we need or want to
[25:04] live. And uh when it's so broken
[25:10] uh I mean I when I started dis doing the
[25:13] studying I started listening to someone
[25:16] recommended me to listen to uh Breedlo's
[25:19] first like 10 or 12 you know with
[25:21] Michael Sailor once I started listening
[25:23] to that and I read uh what's it called?
[25:28] Uh the creature from Jackal Island you
[25:30] know and and and started kind of
[25:32] understanding how broken money was. I
[25:34] realized it's like man I've been a
[25:36] Bitcoiner or looking for Bitcoin I guess
[25:39] for like I don't know the last 12 13
[25:44] years I just didn't know it because you
[25:46] know even before Bitcoin was around
[25:48] because you know uh got married in 2004
[25:52] had our first child in 2006 and I was
[25:54] like okay I' already always heard the
[25:56] rule of thumb six months of you know
[25:59] cushion if you lose your job that way
[26:01] you can give yourself six months to try
[26:03] to find another job. was like okay. So
[26:05] in addition to investments I had you
[26:08] know 6 months of bills paid in the bank
[26:11] and then two or three years later had
[26:14] another kid and I re-evaluated and I was
[26:16] like oh I don't have enough money for 6
[26:20] months if something happens. So I put
[26:23] more money in saved more spent less in
[26:26] investments and then 3 years later our
[26:29] bills hadn't changed. you know, the the
[26:32] boys weren't costing me any more money,
[26:34] but my bills kept going up. I was like,
[26:37] what is the deal? This is ridiculous.
[26:39] And I did it again, right? Well, it can
[26:42] take you 20 years before you realize
[26:45] what's actually happening if you're not
[26:47] actually looking for the solution,
[26:49] right? So, I do feel very blessed and
[26:52] very lucky to have been introduced to
[26:54] Bitcoin when I did. Otherwise, I don't
[26:57] know if how I would have actually found
[26:59] it because if you go to search for
[27:01] finance and investment books and stuff
[27:03] like nobody that I had read up to that
[27:06] point talked about inflation. Nobody
[27:09] mentioned it at all other than oh well
[27:12] inflation is 2% 3% so you need to
[27:14] outpace that. That was it. Nobody had
[27:16] ever said anything else about it or
[27:18] explained it right until I uh you know
[27:24] until I got into breed love is I know
[27:27] there's a few but I had never found them
[27:28] because they're not in wide circulation
[27:30] but in Bitcoin it's the focus right it's
[27:34] one of the key tenants is is a
[27:35] deflationary currency so um now you have
[27:39] you know lenolen you know you've got
[27:43] um uh what is that uh Williams, you
[27:48] know, hard money you can't [ __ ] with,
[27:50] right? You got like Larry Leard's book,
[27:52] which I just finished, which is great.
[27:53] Right now, you have all of these this
[27:55] library is growing. The education's
[27:57] growing. And I really didn't know a lot
[28:00] about Bitcoin when I decided I'm going
[28:02] allin. I just knew that the dollar was
[28:04] broken. I knew that I would feel better,
[28:07] sleep better at night regardless of the
[28:09] volatility dollar amount because I knew
[28:11] the dollar was worthless. I don't care,
[28:14] you know, what the price is of Bitcoin
[28:15] officially today, right? I just know
[28:18] that the dollar is going to be worth
[28:20] less and less tomorrow. So, it doesn't
[28:22] it doesn't matter to me. Bitcoin could
[28:25] stay at, you know, 100, you know, a
[28:28] purchasing value
[28:30] of a certain amount for a year that it
[28:35] will go up in value, right? So even if
[28:37] it just matches true inflation, that's
[28:40] still conserving my energy and my time
[28:43] and not allowing my time and energy to
[28:45] be stolen. So even if it doesn't moon,
[28:47] if it doesn't, you know, do that like
[28:49] crazy, it doesn't matter. The fact is
[28:51] I'm not going to lose over the next 30
[28:53] years, 90% of my energy and time that I
[28:58] uh that I save in the bank because, you
[29:00] know, $100 now in 30 years will only buy
[29:02] $3 worth of crap. So, it's it's it's
[29:06] just a complete mind shift. Uh, but
[29:08] that's why it makes us unemployable,
[29:10] too, right? Because we're not feeding
[29:12] into the the lies and the you see people
[29:16] rushing around in a sales office
[29:18] pretending to work just because they
[29:20] they need their money. They need their
[29:23] paycheck. You know what I mean? Now,
[29:25] it's it's very freeing to know I'm going
[29:27] to do something of value. I'm going to
[29:29] receive Bitcoin in exchange for that and
[29:32] nobody can steal my time and my energy.
[29:34] Nobody can take it away from me at that
[29:36] point. That's a very freeing uh a very
[29:41] uh just lifealtering feeling.
[29:45] And Bitcoin gives you a lot of options
[29:49] because all of the sudden if you're
[29:52] stacking
[29:53] consistently Bitcoin, you probably and
[29:57] for a long time you probably put some
[30:00] money to the side. So you could probably
[30:02] afford let's say 2 months, 6 months,
[30:05] maybe a year, maybe two years, maybe
[30:07] even like 10 years without income. This
[30:10] gives you the optionality to say, I'm no
[30:13] no longer willing to trade my life for
[30:15] for that work or for that whatever
[30:17] you're doing. I'm quitting that and I'm
[30:21] searching for a better alternative. I
[30:23] want to have a better life. And I think
[30:25] that's something really powerful because
[30:28] a lot of Bitcoiners like most Bitcoiners
[30:30] get in that I'm stacking. I have I have
[30:33] some savings plan set up and and all of
[30:36] those things and this gives you really a
[30:38] lot of optionality and freedom. It is a
[30:40] savings plan that actually works and
[30:42] it's growing up in the US. My parents
[30:46] were told the same thing, right? It's
[30:49] you
[30:50] just you go through the system, you get
[30:53] a degree, you get a good job, you do a
[30:56] good job, you save your money, right?
[31:00] And and invest a little bit of it, but
[31:02] be careful because investments are
[31:04] risky, right? But you do that and you'll
[31:07] be okay. And that was all a lie. It was
[31:09] all a lie because you're playing in a
[31:11] rigged system and nobody told you what
[31:13] the originally what the real rules were,
[31:16] right? Um I mean I there are people
[31:20] older individuals right like my parents
[31:22] age in their 70s late 60s early 70s that
[31:26] to some degree still believe that you
[31:28] know the US dollar is backed by all the
[31:30] golden Fort Knox. I'm like, wait, read
[31:35] read one book, right? And it's you you
[31:37] learn about, you know, Nixon and you
[31:39] learn about going off the gold standard
[31:41] and you learn about inflation, all this
[31:42] and you're just like, it's a rigged
[31:44] system. I I don't so I don't want to
[31:47] play in that system anymore. I'm done
[31:49] with that system. Right? And then you
[31:51] you have no respect for that system. You
[31:55] don't buy into the propaganda and you
[31:58] just go with what you know and you feel
[32:00] is right. And that yeah it's uh it just
[32:05] changes your life. It it can change your
[32:06] life if you let it.
[32:09] So you you said something interesting uh
[32:12] before you said something uh back in the
[32:15] days when Bitcoin was still
[32:17] risk. When did it for you or is it I I I
[32:21] presume for you now you you see Bitcoin
[32:23] as a riskoff asset. When did it became
[32:25] for you a riskoff asset? How how do you
[32:28] look at that?
[32:29] So yeah, I I'm definitely not that
[32:32] there's probably a lot of people out
[32:33] there smarter enough smart enough to
[32:36] say, you know, we're seeing that shift
[32:38] now and kind of saying economically. I
[32:40] guess it was it's more of a personal
[32:42] opinion and a personal decision, right?
[32:43] It becomes a riskoff for anyone once
[32:46] they get to a point where they
[32:47] understand it, right? So everybody's
[32:49] different.
[32:50] Um to me, it was in
[32:54] 2022. I had started in September of 21,
[32:57] I think. September 21 with this company
[33:00] and started working with these
[33:01] Bitcoiners and meeting them and uh and
[33:05] just spending time with them, working
[33:06] with them on projects. Started studying
[33:09] a little bit and I was like I I treated
[33:11] it like every other investment. I was
[33:13] like, man, these guys are dumping
[33:14] millions and millions of dollars into
[33:16] these sites, like tens and hundreds of
[33:18] millions of dollars into these sites. Uh
[33:20] they they must know something I don't.
[33:22] And so since they're all smarter than
[33:24] me, I'm going to start investing in
[33:26] Bitcoin. But I treated it like an
[33:27] investment. And so I started dollar cost
[33:30] averaging just a little bit in. But then
[33:32] I realized really quickly what little,
[33:34] you know, um, investments I had had in
[33:38] like a like an IR like a Roth IRA or
[33:41] something like in other investment
[33:42] accounts. Bitcoin was very rapidly
[33:45] catching up with that. It was outpacing
[33:47] outpacing it through even as a DCA and
[33:50] it was going down down down down. But I
[33:53] just kept reading uh kept listening to
[33:56] Sailor and doing more and more research
[34:00] and then but I was still kind of it's
[34:02] it's cool. I get it deflationary but
[34:04] it's still an investment. It's volatile.
[34:07] At the end of
[34:09] 22 it clicked. I was like, "Okay,
[34:14] um, if Bitcoin has more than a 0% chance
[34:19] of going up in
[34:21] value, I have there's a 100% chance the
[34:25] dollars I hold will go down in value,
[34:28] right? To
[34:30] me, that's better odds, right? Like I
[34:33] rather than holding something that is
[34:35] melting away, I want to hold something
[34:38] that is hard and is going to be there
[34:42] and is, you know, I can depend on,
[34:44] right? So, and I also but I was still
[34:47] looking at it from an investment
[34:48] perspective. So, I was like, okay, well,
[34:50] $20,000 it's gone down from 64,000 or
[34:54] 65,000. Man, I I think that's the
[34:56] bottom. And so, I went all in. Like I
[34:59] cashed out everything else and went all
[35:01] into Bitcoin and then I cried as it
[35:03] dropped to 16 because I was like, "Oh
[35:06] no, what have I done to our finances, to
[35:10] my family? I have ruined us. Bitcoin's
[35:12] going to die. It's going to lose."
[35:14] Right? I was one of those guys who's
[35:15] like, "Bitcoin died today." Right?
[35:18] So, so I cried through the holidays and
[35:23] got through to January and I just hadn't
[35:27] I just said, you know what? Uh, I give
[35:29] up if I I'm not going to win the fiat
[35:31] game. I'm not going to win with Bitcoin.
[35:33] I'm just not going to win. I'm just
[35:35] done. I give up. And so, I didn't make
[35:37] any changes. I didn't like liquidate it.
[35:39] I just let it sit. And, uh, it started
[35:43] creeping up. And then in January, it was
[35:45] like already back up to 20. It was a It
[35:47] was a really low 25% or really short dip
[35:50] and I I was like, "Oh, okay. Well, now
[35:53] I'm back at break even, so I feel a
[35:55] little better, but I was still very
[35:57] stressed and working." And then it just
[36:00] kept moving and kept moving up and kept
[36:02] moving up and kept moving up. And at
[36:04] that point, I realized it it clicked
[36:07] what it was. And it was not a matter of
[36:11] because of the scarcity built into it,
[36:13] right? that that is mathematically
[36:16] um a part of it. You you can't break
[36:19] that. You either play by the the
[36:20] mathematical rules of Bitcoin or you
[36:22] don't get to play. Um I couldn't put
[36:25] enough money into it. Like my paycheck
[36:27] would come in and I'd immediately I I
[36:28] had seen an interview with Jack Mers and
[36:31] he said, "I think it'd be great if
[36:32] everybody just put all their money in
[36:34] Bitcoin and then cashed out once a month
[36:36] to pay their bills." And I was like,
[36:37] "That sounds good. Let's try that." uh
[36:41] some months it worked out, some months
[36:42] it didn't, but more often than not, it
[36:45] was a positive move. I would put money
[36:48] in, it would go up and by the time a
[36:51] month later I needed to pay my bills, I
[36:54] had additional Bitcoin, right? Like I
[36:56] like I I was profitable technically. I
[36:58] was paying and I was like, "Oh, so this
[37:00] is what they mean by deflationary
[37:02] currency.
[37:03] uh any money I have now or I could spend
[37:06] the money now and pay my bill early or
[37:08] if I wait even 30
[37:10] days I'm paying less right so if Bitcoin
[37:14] went up 10% I was only paying 90% of my
[37:18] bills I had used money in the past to
[37:21] pay bills in the future but it my my
[37:23] cost average for those bills had gone
[37:25] down and so once that clicked I was like
[37:27] I'm in I'm just in so transacting in
[37:31] Bitcoin as much as possible getting paid
[37:32] in Bitcoin as much as possible. Paying
[37:34] with Bitcoin as much as possible. Uh you
[37:37] can still report your t, you know, your
[37:39] stuff to your taxes, right? Still do
[37:41] that. Whatever you want to, you can play
[37:43] it as however you want to do, right? It
[37:45] just gives you the freedom to decide
[37:46] that. And if it truly is a deflationary
[37:49] currency, which it is, then you know,
[37:52] the longer you hold on to it, the better
[37:54] it is. And so I saw that now as just
[37:57] playing the fiat game. I just had a
[38:00] better tool to play the game, right? I
[38:02] had the trump card. I was able to
[38:05] actually beat the system because I saw
[38:08] how it was broken and Bitcoin was the
[38:10] way out of it. And so at that point,
[38:13] maybe around late 23, early 24, you
[38:18] know, when I started making some good
[38:19] money, my paycheck would come in, I
[38:22] would immediately empty my bank account.
[38:24] I'd, you know, buy Bitcoin through
[38:26] River. Uh now I sometimes I buy some in
[38:29] uh in the Fold app, right? and just
[38:32] leave it there until I need to use my
[38:33] debit card to pay bills or whatever. Um,
[38:36] and it's some months, yeah, okay, it may
[38:39] look like I lost some money, right? But
[38:41] long
[38:41] term it's going to it's it's been it's
[38:45] been amazing. Timing for me was lucky
[38:47] too, right? I came in 22 and then had
[38:50] two years to build. Uh, so I got to
[38:53] experience all of that. Let's take a
[38:56] break for a moment and appreciate the
[38:58] beauty that Coin Vigilante has made with
[39:01] the Bitcoin watches. Those watches are
[39:04] the most amazing, the most eleigent way
[39:07] of showing that you are a true
[39:09] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[39:12] dropped a completely new and amazing
[39:14] Genesis edition of their watch
[39:17] collections. You have the date of the
[39:19] first ever mined Bitcoin block in there
[39:23] and of course also the block height and
[39:25] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[39:29] the level of detail they put in in this
[39:32] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[39:34] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[39:37] down in the descriptions. I love those
[39:39] watches so so much. And now if you have
[39:42] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[39:45] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[39:47] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[39:49] to deal with that. The first way is you
[39:51] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[39:54] entry for you to get into the
[39:56] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[39:59] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[40:02] super simple and secure way. And if you
[40:05] check out the link in the description,
[40:07] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[40:10] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[40:13] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[40:16] partner in terms of how to get the most
[40:19] out of your sovereignty. They will
[40:22] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[40:25] that is perfect for your individual
[40:28] situation. They will show you how you
[40:30] can secure your own devices. Securing
[40:33] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[40:35] have to keep all your devices secure.
[40:37] One topic that is overlooked often is
[40:39] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[40:42] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[40:45] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[40:47] place already? And last but not least,
[40:49] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[40:51] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[40:54] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[40:59] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[41:02] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[41:05] be for the first time ever speaking at
[41:07] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[41:10] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[41:13] really looking forward to seeing all of
[41:14] you there. You can get your ticket in
[41:17] the link down in the description of
[41:19] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[41:22] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[41:25] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[41:27] there. Interesting. So, you live on a
[41:30] 100% Bitcoin have $5,000 of cash at any
[41:34] given time loaded on my fold card and
[41:36] almost all of my other balances are
[41:38] zero. Wow. I love that. That that that
[41:41] that's that's shows the I always say and
[41:45] and I'm I'm very similar. I I might I
[41:49] don't have this $5,000.
[41:52] I'm I'm to totally on zero. Well, I have
[41:55] 5,000 just because like in the next week
[41:57] or two, right, I have bills coming up
[41:59] to. So, it's like I've decided that's
[42:01] just the number to always have there,
[42:03] right? But I think if there's a lot of
[42:05] Bitcoiners out there that they have a
[42:06] lot of Bitcoin, so they're not as
[42:08] worried about it. So maybe they have,
[42:10] you know, they may still have, you know,
[42:12] 30, 40, 50, $100,000 cash plus other
[42:15] investments. If every single
[42:18] Bitcoiner went to zero or as close to
[42:21] zero or maybe even like, you know, they
[42:24] were 2% 3%, right? They really did that.
[42:28] You would see a hu and and they did it
[42:30] with self- custody. you would see a huge
[42:32] shift in the amount available on
[42:35] exchanges. Some of these uh some of the
[42:38] paper Bitcoin Ponzies that I think are
[42:40] kind of kind of coming around and
[42:41] playing right now with some of the with
[42:43] some of the exchanges. I don't have any
[42:45] proof of that, but just a feeling that I
[42:47] think a lot of that would be exposed. Um
[42:50] things would rapidly rapidly change uh
[42:54] across all financial ecosystems. It
[42:56] would just happen almost overnight um if
[42:59] we were we were able to do that. So, and
[43:01] I realized that um listening to Mers
[43:05] talk about it, right? And I was like,
[43:07] yeah, it's like if you exit the system
[43:09] as soon as you possibly can, you're
[43:12] basically throwing your dollars back at
[43:13] them saying, "I don't need this crap.
[43:16] It's worthless. It's not worth
[43:17] anything." And I'd rather do that now
[43:19] before we go to hyperinflation, you
[43:22] know, uh and we have another, you know,
[43:24] Zimbabwe or Argentina or, you know, all
[43:26] this other all these other countries
[43:28] because that eventually will happen with
[43:29] the dollar. So, I just want to be on the
[43:31] right side of it. I don't know when it's
[43:32] going to happen, so I want to be on the
[43:34] right side of it regardless of when it
[43:37] happens. That's a good good way be
[43:41] because if you're still trying to time
[43:45] the market, which which you would do if
[43:47] you are uh not 100% there where you want
[43:51] to be. So let's say if you have like 20%
[43:54] of your portfolio in fiat cash, not
[43:58] because as a security
[44:01] uh to pay your bills, but as um a buying
[44:05] the dip opportunity down the road,
[44:08] you're basically timing the market at
[44:10] that point. If if if you don't if you
[44:13] get that you don't want to have uh fiat
[44:15] I mean maybe you have other investments
[44:17] that's fine but you are timing the
[44:19] market if if you have uh cash on on the
[44:21] side just for the sake of maybe being
[44:24] able to buy more Bitcoin with that and
[44:26] timing the market with Bitcoin is it's
[44:28] dangerous very dangerous and I think
[44:31] it's interesting because people will say
[44:33] that it's like well I want that as an
[44:34] emergency right well one of the biggest
[44:38] uh you know tools lopsided
[44:41] uh rules in the fiat system
[44:45] that you know people people who are rich
[44:49] and successful understand and people
[44:50] that are broke and poor may never get a
[44:53] hold of and that's debt, right? How to
[44:55] properly use debt. Um it is a tool that
[44:59] they're using
[45:01] um to keep people down. Well, if you
[45:05] have that much money cash available,
[45:07] it's pretty good safe bet that you've
[45:09] got a nice credit score of, you know,
[45:11] 700, 720, maybe higher, right? So, if
[45:14] you've got a good credit score, you can
[45:17] get a$25,
[45:19] $30,000 credit card tomorrow that just
[45:23] they're like, "Yeah, unsecured debt.
[45:24] Yeah, just take it, whatever." Right?
[45:26] And and you can take it. Um, I got and
[45:30] you can take it and use it and that's
[45:31] your emergency fund, right? And then if
[45:33] I have to liquidate Bitcoin later,
[45:35] great. But then I took it a step further
[45:37] after listening to Sailor. And this
[45:40] was it. By all other rules of investing
[45:45] and uh finance, it was the dumbest thing
[45:48] I ever could have done. But I took a
[45:52] $20,000 credit card and I bought Bitcoin
[45:55] down around like
[45:57] 2530,000, right? I just bought. So, it
[46:00] was like maybe 80% of a coin at the
[46:02] time, something like that. And I took it
[46:05] and I decided I'm going to cash out the
[46:08] Bitcoin I bought with this to make uh
[46:11] minimum or to make payments on this with
[46:14] the 20% interest rate and I'm going to
[46:17] do that for one year. Now, if I have to
[46:20] liquidate other Bitcoin, if things go
[46:21] crazy and I see feel like I'm I'm losing
[46:24] this battle, I'll liquidate and I've
[46:26] lost some Bitcoin. That's fine. that
[46:28] this is a risk I'm going to take. Um, I
[46:31] did that for 12 months and I still had
[46:33] half a Bitcoin by the time everything
[46:34] was said and done because Bitcoin went
[46:37] up. I was I timed the market correctly
[46:39] with that, right? But then I looked at
[46:42] it at looked at all my other stuff and I
[46:44] was like, "Oh, but my man, if you don't
[46:47] want that
[46:48] risk, just do a
[46:51] DCA, you know, dollar cost average
[46:53] weekly or paycheck stack." And it
[46:56] actually it it almost performed just as
[47:00] well, right? Because at the same time I
[47:01] was taking money from that I would earn
[47:03] every two weeks and or every month and I
[47:05] would put it into Bitcoin and just let
[47:07] it sit,
[47:08] right? Bitcoin is so strong a tool over
[47:12] a long enough time period. I did it with
[47:15] 12 months and I got lucky. But if you
[47:17] did it over five or six or seven months
[47:19] years or eight or 10 years, which you
[47:21] could do with a credit card, right? All
[47:24] you're doing is accelerating that
[47:26] collapse. You're taking more and more
[47:28] money out of that system. Uh every time
[47:31] debt is issued, it's not a bank that has
[47:35] like if I have a credit card and I do
[47:38] and I charge $5,000 on it, that's not a
[47:40] bank somewhere that has $5,000 that
[47:42] they're paying on my behalf and then oh
[47:44] well, you better pay us back. It's
[47:46] literally ones and zeros being created
[47:49] out of thin air, right? there's no real
[47:52] dollars backing that debt, right? If you
[47:55] truly want fiat to accelerate and
[47:58] disappear, doing those kinds of things
[48:01] just accelerates it, right? Um and so I
[48:06] I was very radicalized, you know, after
[48:09] after reading uh and studying to the
[48:12] point where I was willing to try that.
[48:14] To be fair, I don't take that much risk
[48:16] on anymore. Uh even though I think that
[48:18] Bitcoin is very close to uh uh is close
[48:23] to, you know, only upside, the very very
[48:26] little downside, um I think we're about
[48:28] to see a a switch flip hopefully. But uh
[48:32] even so, the nice thing about it is
[48:34] Bitcoin can help you regardless of what
[48:35] your personal risk
[48:39] um risk aversion is, right? If you just
[48:42] want long-term savings and don't want
[48:44] your time and energy devalued, just put
[48:47] it no more savings accounts, just put
[48:50] savings into Bitcoin. If you want, like
[48:52] Sailor said in his presentation, you
[48:55] want to get aggressive, you're going to,
[48:57] you know, leverage your house, you're
[48:59] going to leverage unsecured debt, you're
[49:00] going to sell everything you own, sell
[49:02] all your chairs, and you're going to go
[49:03] all the way back. You can do that,
[49:05] right? You can. Uh, but it I think
[49:09] whatever you do, you just get in as hard
[49:12] as you personally feel comfortable with
[49:14] and Bitcoin will meet you wherever that
[49:16] is. That's the great thing about it.
[49:22] Yes. Have you noticed outside of of
[49:26] financial things that Bitcoin since you
[49:30] are full on Bitcoin and and have like
[49:32] the the the Bitcoin sen uh found has
[49:36] that changed the way you you make
[49:38] decisions or any anything like that?
[49:40] Yeah. Um what my favorite part Well,
[49:42] there's a lot of good things, right? But
[49:44] my favorite part about about it probably
[49:46] is still the financial side. So, like I
[49:49] hired uh uh somebody uh to do to help me
[49:53] out with a project and uh you know, I
[49:56] can't remember what the amount was, but
[49:57] let's say it's like $5,000 for 30 days
[49:59] worth of work um or a couple weeks worth
[50:01] of work or something. And I I said I
[50:05] said, "Okay, well, yeah, here's my
[50:07] agreement with you, and I'll pay you
[50:08] 5,000 for this work once it's done." And
[50:11] he said, "Sure." And I had all my money
[50:14] in Bitcoin. And then I waited 30 days
[50:19] and that $5,000 in Bitcoin was now worth
[50:21] like $6,000. Like it had gone up like 15
[50:25] 20%. Right. And I realized at that point
[50:28] I was like, "Oh, okay. Uh I'm not I'm
[50:32] not agreeing even with Bitcoiners and
[50:34] they don't like this. I'm never
[50:36] negotiating in Bitcoin's price, right?
[50:39] I'm going to negotiate in the worthless
[50:41] fiat currency price because $5,000 today
[50:45] not only goes down in as little as a
[50:48] month in in purchasing power, the
[50:51] Bitcoin actually appreciates. So So I
[50:53] got a double whammy. I got an
[50:55] appreciation here and I got a
[50:56] depreciation on the currency. This
[50:58] spread right here is where I, you know,
[51:00] prosper, right? and that gap is become
[51:03] and that that that thing is becoming
[51:05] wider that those two trends line trend
[51:07] lines are getting further and further
[51:09] apart. Um and so that was a very big
[51:12] shift. It also made me in the past I had
[51:15] only used debt to like uh buy
[51:19] uh buy something if they offered me 0%
[51:23] interest financing. You know what I
[51:25] mean? It's like, well, why would I take
[51:26] an interest on something if, you know, I
[51:29] have the cash to pay for it and then I
[51:31] just pay for it and I have it and I
[51:32] don't have future bills, right? Well,
[51:34] you do. You take the interest on it
[51:36] regardless as long as it's less than
[51:39] Bitcoin. Bitcoin's appreciation. So, if
[51:41] you believe that your debt, Bitcoin's
[51:43] going to stay the same or go up in, you
[51:45] know, in the amount of time it's going
[51:47] to take you to pay that off, then you
[51:49] keep your money in Bitcoin, right? You
[51:50] take out the debt. So, just kind of back
[51:52] to that debt thing, the financial side
[51:54] decisions, it completely changed, um,
[51:57] the way that I operated my business and
[51:59] my general accounting and things like
[52:00] that. And then, um, I was incredibly
[52:04] lucky to go to, um, uh, Madera for
[52:07] Bitcoin Atlantis in 24 and had a brief
[52:12] opportunity to talk to Sailor for like
[52:14] 10 minutes and I just said, "Hey,
[52:16] thanks. Want to tell you thank you. I've
[52:18] taken a lot of your examples and I'm
[52:20] actually operating my small consultant
[52:22] business on the same standards. And I
[52:24] thought he would say, "Oh,
[52:25] congratulations. That's great." And he'd
[52:27] walk off because I'm a nobody. And he
[52:29] goes, "Really? How so?" Right? So I was
[52:32] like, he wanted he truly wanted to know,
[52:36] right, how I was doing this. And at the
[52:38] end of it, I stepped back and I
[52:41] realized, oh man, Sailor just
[52:43] workshopped my accounting ideas and he,
[52:46] you know, was nice enough to talk to me.
[52:47] And I was so dumb I didn't even take a
[52:49] picture with him. I feel bad. But super,
[52:52] you know, surprisingly down to earth for
[52:54] the type of guy that he is, right? But
[52:56] he truly was interested. And he said,
[52:58] "No, no, no." He said, "You're be
[52:59] careful with your percentages because
[53:01] you're, you know, operating at a much
[53:03] higher, you know, I take money at
[53:04] basically zero or nothing, next to
[53:06] nothing." He said, "But you're you're
[53:08] you're" He said, "I think your
[53:10] principles are correct, you know." And
[53:12] so once I heard that, you know, it was
[53:15] it was just just go just go just go
[53:17] whatever. Um, put it, you know, go on
[53:20] the standard as hard hard as you can.
[53:22] Um, but and aside from that, the the
[53:26] culture around Bitcoin is really
[53:27] interesting from a truth perspective,
[53:30] right? Don't trust uh but verify. Um,
[53:33] and so like you could say the whole cast
[53:35] iron versus, you know, stainless steel
[53:37] pans is kind of a funny one, right? But
[53:40] like there's a lot of people there's a
[53:42] strong correlation between Bitcoiners
[53:44] and going carnivore, right? Because we
[53:47] look at it and we feel like the truth is
[53:50] or even if it's not like truth truth,
[53:52] right? But uh but and I I I abhore the
[53:56] word the phrase my truth, right? Because
[53:59] that's false. Uh truth is truth. But uh
[54:03] for me personally, my you know what I
[54:06] the results I get on carnivore make me
[54:09] feel and look so much better than when I
[54:13] was trying to eat you know a mix of
[54:15] vegetables and fruits and I thought I
[54:16] could have a little bit of sugar every
[54:18] now and then and all that kind of stuff,
[54:19] right? It's like you get on carnivore
[54:21] and you figure out how to deal and
[54:22] you're like, "Oh, wow. Okay, here's
[54:24] results." Right? So it's it's that proof
[54:26] of work that transfers from Bitcoin to
[54:28] all those other aspects of life. So,
[54:31] relationships, you stop wasting time
[54:33] with relationships that you know are not
[54:36] good for you andor you're not good for
[54:38] that person, right? Um, and that's
[54:41] personal, work, uh, all of it, right?
[54:45] And so now it's like the the people I
[54:48] spend the most time with, whether it be
[54:51] work or personal now, are the people
[54:54] that I met through Bitcoin, right? Um,
[54:57] especially the miners that I've worked
[54:59] with and actually been in the trenches,
[55:01] been on site, you know, trying to get
[55:03] hash rate up and running, stuff like
[55:04] that. There's like a it's it's like a
[55:06] war. It's like that camaraderie you get
[55:09] when two guys, you know, go to war and
[55:11] they're in a foxhole together trying to
[55:13] survive, right? It's like that. Men need
[55:16] that, right? We all need it, but men
[55:18] especially, we need to know we're part
[55:20] of a team. um and that there's we're
[55:22] willing to put in the work especially
[55:25] and we can work harder if we know
[55:26] somebody is there that's got our back
[55:28] right and so um I like on the fiat side
[55:33] of my life right that's I've got a few
[55:35] close friends that I still truly love
[55:37] right and I've spent a lot of time and
[55:41] really prayer to some degree trying to
[55:43] get say when are they going to figure
[55:44] this out because I want them to have
[55:46] that uh but if they don't that's fine I
[55:50] still love them, but it's like there's
[55:52] less and less attachment to them
[55:54] personally. It's a very weird
[55:58] uh it's a very weird and strange
[56:01] um shift relationally, but it but it's
[56:06] it's important. you you naturally are
[56:08] drawn to people that make you a better
[56:13] person and um are willing to put in the
[56:16] time and the effort and the work with
[56:18] you uh to understand it. It's that it's
[56:21] that whole proofof work shift.
[56:25] I also saw that that
[56:28] Bitcoin I mean I don't know if if if
[56:30] Bitcoin makes you humble or if Bitcoin
[56:34] attracts humble people. I'm not sure
[56:37] maybe a mix of both of them. But I I I
[56:40] got to learn and and maybe just a quick
[56:43] story because this this podcast didn't
[56:47] exist like one year and like four or
[56:49] five months ago and I came from IT
[56:53] security sales and I was approaching the
[56:56] podcast similar. I was like, I will I
[56:59] will write 20
[57:01] people and maybe two of them say yes to
[57:05] to be on the
[57:06] podcast. So I was like, okay, let's
[57:09] write 50 so I have some some more
[57:12] people. And almost all of them said yes.
[57:16] Almost all of them. And I didn't even
[57:19] had a YouTube channel at back like the
[57:22] the podcast was non-existing. I was
[57:24] writing them, hey, I start a podcast and
[57:25] I would love to have you on as one of my
[57:27] first guests. And they're like, let's do
[57:29] it. And and not even
[57:34] like all the ranges. Even a Jeff Boof
[57:37] came on my podcast when my YouTube
[57:39] channel had like 200 subscribers. So
[57:42] that almost non-existing. And I've
[57:45] learned through starting this podcast
[57:47] how generous and humble and nice that
[57:51] the overall Bitcoin crowd is there.
[57:54] There's always a bad apple in in every
[57:56] community, but generally Bitcoiners are
[57:59] super humble and super nice. I'm I'm
[58:02] just curious how you discovered that.
[58:05] And and so let's step back and think
[58:07] about what you just said because I was
[58:08] thinking I it's a reoccurring theme that
[58:12] I mentioned when I was saying I felt
[58:14] like I was losing because I kept looking
[58:18] at my bank account, right? And my money
[58:20] would not cover the six months worth of
[58:22] emergency fund
[58:24] bills. The fiat system, you came from
[58:28] the sales background. I came from a
[58:29] sales background, right? So, uh, you
[58:32] know, the biggest thing I ever said that
[58:35] I was always told in sales is it's a
[58:36] numbers game. You know, you make a
[58:39] hundred phone calls a day. I I had a lot
[58:41] of like phone jobs, right? So, it's like
[58:43] a hundred phone calls a day. I had one
[58:45] job where I had to one call close a $500
[58:48] transaction on every single call, right?
[58:51] So, I would do like a hundred calls a
[58:54] day. I would maybe talk to 15 people and
[58:58] my goal was to close one of those 15
[59:00] people, right? And I was expected to do
[59:03] that uh five days a week, eight hours a
[59:07] day, right? It was brutal. Um and so in
[59:12] any kind of sales job, they always tell
[59:13] you it's like you got to be good with
[59:15] rejection, right? It's not personal.
[59:17] Sometimes it is. Sometimes everybody
[59:19] deals with [ __ ] but it's sometimes
[59:22] it's uh it's not personal. they just
[59:25] don't want it, they don't need it, it's
[59:26] not a fit. And you take that and you
[59:28] move on and you go to the next one,
[59:29] right?
[59:31] Uh, Bitcoin flips that, right? You were
[59:35] doing the same thing. You had that same
[59:37] concept that had been beaten into us by
[59:39] the fiat system, which is you invest in
[59:42] a 100 companies as a venture capitalist
[59:44] and maybe one of them will work, right?
[59:46] or or you you you buy you buy funds
[59:50] because you can't pick a certain stock,
[59:53] so you're going to let someone who's
[59:54] smarter than you just pick a whole bunch
[59:55] of them and hopefully it goes up, right?
[59:58] It's such a terrible system. It's just
[60:00] so broken and it encourages failure,
[60:04] right? It's like, oh, it's okay
[60:06] if 99 of these companies don't work
[60:09] because we're only going to we're going
[60:10] to have one that does. You know, that's
[60:12] that's terrible. Why are you okay with a
[60:14] 99% failure rate? That's what the dollar
[60:17] is, right? It's it's gone down. I mean,
[60:20] you know, on a long enough timeline, the
[60:22] dollar started out at, you know, would
[60:25] buy a dollar in 1931 or whatever it was,
[60:29] and now it buys three cents worth,
[60:32] right? It's like it's you're you're at
[60:34] that failure rate. Bitcoin flips the
[60:36] script on that. Bitcoin is no, no, no.
[60:39] We're going to be 99%
[60:42] uh we're going to win 99% of the time.
[60:45] How do you lose? Well, there's a 1%
[60:47] chance, but we've got 99% uptime. You
[60:50] know, there was one time when the
[60:53] Bitcoin network was going to go down,
[60:56] but core developers caught it and fixed.
[60:58] You know, it's like all this stuff. It's
[61:00] a different attitude, right? So,
[61:02] Bitcoiners have that attitude. It's um
[61:05] they see
[61:07] you trying to do something right and
[61:10] trying to be
[61:11] successful. It doesn't matter. Uh, you
[61:15] know, if you if you're, like I said, if
[61:18] your intentions are noble, right? You're
[61:21] like, "Well, I think Bitcoin's
[61:22] interesting. It's changed the lives of a
[61:24] lot of people and I I don't know what
[61:25] your first email was or your, you know,
[61:27] your message or whatever, but like it's
[61:29] changed the lives and I want to share
[61:30] that." People like, "Oh, yeah. I'm happy
[61:32] to. Let's do that." Right? For multiple
[61:35] reasons. People do like to talk about
[61:36] themselves. That's their favorite
[61:38] subject. But on top of that, Bitcoiners
[61:41] want to share that message because they
[61:43] want to others to have that same
[61:46] feeling. That's a different shift,
[61:48] right? It's not just like, "Hey, come
[61:50] work for me and you can make $100,000,"
[61:52] right? That guy wants you to come work
[61:53] for him to make $100,000 so he could
[61:56] make $20,000 off of you, right?
[61:59] Bitcoiners are just like, "Hey, man.
[62:01] This has changed my life and it's made
[62:02] my life better. Let me show you how it
[62:04] can make yours better." And Bitcoin
[62:06] gives you the means and the time and the
[62:08] energy to be able to do that. I'm not
[62:11] racing around 8, 10, 12, 16 hour days
[62:15] anymore just to pay my bills. I don't
[62:18] have to do that anymore. And so it
[62:21] completely changed. I love that story,
[62:24] right? Because you're like, "Oh crap, I
[62:26] got to do a podcast. I got I got to get
[62:28] a channel set. I got to get this stuff
[62:30] going, right?" And it but it gives you
[62:32] the motivation also to see the potential
[62:35] right. So seeing the potential in
[62:37] Bitcoin from a monetary perspective is
[62:39] probably what draws you know number go
[62:42] up technology is usually what draws
[62:43] people in first right but past that the
[62:47] opportunities to build on it the
[62:49] openness of Bitcoiners what other people
[62:52] are doing that's going to really change
[62:54] the world it's built around Bitcoin on
[62:56] Bitcoin as a base layer but really what
[62:58] they're doing is so much more important
[63:00] than that uh that
[63:03] is that is the shift that you're you
[63:05] just highlighted right there, right?
[63:09] What can I do to help you? And you're
[63:11] you're like every single one of them
[63:13] responded back. I think that's Yeah,
[63:15] that's a testament to kind of what
[63:17] Bitcoin can do for an individual as a
[63:20] person, right?
[63:24] It's it's it's it's fascinating the the
[63:26] Bitcoin community. I thought we talk a
[63:29] lot about mining today, but we actually
[63:30] talked a lot about uh Bitcoin in
[63:33] general. It's it's it's really really
[63:34] cool. Um I have one question that I
[63:38] asked each and every one of my guests
[63:39] and the question is uh always the same
[63:42] one. What can we learn from you besides
[63:44] Bitcoin man?
[63:47] Um man it's hard to say because when you
[63:49] go all in Bitcoin it's like it's it
[63:52] consumes your life a little bit. Let's
[63:54] see. Um I am a big fan. I've I've been
[63:57] playing guitar for since I was 14 years
[63:59] old. Um, it's going on, oh man, now that
[64:04] I think about it, it's going over 30
[64:06] years. And, uh, I thought for a while I
[64:08] was going to be a professional musician.
[64:09] That was one of the things I tried to do
[64:11] when I moved to Austin. I'm I'm based in
[64:13] Austin, Texas. Um, and it turns out I
[64:16] wasn't very good. So, I didn't get to
[64:18] become a I played a lot and had a lot of
[64:21] fun. Uh, but I didn't I realized it's
[64:24] like I don't really have what it takes
[64:25] to be a professional musician. But, I
[64:27] still play that play the guitar. uh
[64:30] fairly regularly, but it's just purely
[64:33] for fun and for me. Um and so I actually
[64:37] got a degree in art. Uh I I did some
[64:40] sculpture, some painting, uh ceramics,
[64:43] all that kind of stuff. And uh the
[64:45] reason I did it is because uh it was the
[64:47] only thing that sounded fun in college
[64:50] to me at the time. Uh I I was just
[64:52] getting a degree to get a degree because
[64:54] I was told that's what you were supposed
[64:56] to do. Uh but I ended up being um
[64:59] uh getting my degree in art because it
[65:01] was just um it was fun. I liked working
[65:04] with my hands. I like building things. I
[65:07] like taking shapes, moving them around.
[65:10] Representation, 2D and 3D space is very
[65:12] interesting to me. Uh and then the
[65:14] musical side, right? It's like it it's a
[65:18] whole other dimension, right? Music is
[65:19] like a different dimension. Um and it's
[65:21] interesting how different sounds make us
[65:23] feel differently, right? Regardless of
[65:25] the message or the lyrics. And so that
[65:30] those are things that are very
[65:31] passionate to me. I don't, you know,
[65:34] care what you're into, right? But I
[65:38] think we all need something that we do
[65:42] uh creative purely for the joy of doing
[65:46] it, right? Not actually building
[65:48] anything. It can be reading fiction. It
[65:51] can be art of some type. It can be
[65:54] music. It can be uh landscaping, it can
[65:58] be architecture, it can be whatever. Uh
[66:02] and the the and I've always enjoyed that
[66:05] when I could get to it because it's it's
[66:08] good for your soul. It just gives you
[66:10] kind of a break from all the mundane and
[66:12] gives you the ability to kind of refocus
[66:15] uh and and know that everything's going
[66:17] to be okay. But like I
[66:21] uh I I I always loved to do that in my
[66:24] life, but I've never been able to do
[66:26] that because I was always racing against
[66:30] uh you know against the fiat machine,
[66:33] right? I was always always felt like I
[66:35] was on a hamster wheel. Uh even if
[66:39] you're not 100% into Bitcoin yet,
[66:41] regardless, figure out something you can
[66:45] do that is just for you like that. Um it
[66:49] just it feeds it feeds the soul. It's
[66:52] very important.
[66:53] um you can't we I think we throw around
[66:57] the term self-care a little bit too much
[67:00] um in our current society, but uh if you
[67:04] don't take care of yourself physically
[67:06] and mentally, you're not able to take
[67:08] care of anyone or anything. So, take a
[67:12] little bit of that time um and find
[67:15] something to do. Uh I I don't know if
[67:18] that's something I can teach, you know,
[67:20] you can learn from me, but I feel like
[67:22] it's uh I'm happy to be that example and
[67:26] just kind of share that message and make
[67:29] sure people are doing that, right? U
[67:31] it's easy if you're uh a very technical
[67:34] person or developer to dive into Bitcoin
[67:37] and that may be your fun, right? It's
[67:39] not for me. Looking at lines of code is
[67:41] not for me, but um find something. some
[67:44] of the best projects in Bitcoin have
[67:46] actually come out of that which I think
[67:48] is amazing right like uh on the mining
[67:51] side gridless right and what they're
[67:53] doing uh in Africa is unbelievable right
[67:57] they were like well yeah we can we can
[67:59] mine Bitcoin on these tiny little hydro
[68:01] dams and then on top of that they're
[68:03] providing electrical infrastructure to
[68:05] people that have never had electricity
[68:07] before right that that it's it's one of
[68:09] the most amazing projects I've seen in
[68:11] Bitcoin um truly truly changing people's
[68:15] lives for the better. Uh Noster started
[68:19] out uh there's a company in Austin,
[68:22] Tramble Venture Partners, and they had a
[68:24] um they have like a once a a week sort
[68:27] of thing for their developers um that
[68:30] would say it was like, "Okay, if you
[68:32] have a a project that you've been
[68:35] working on that we can't monetize, we
[68:37] can't figure out how to monetize it, we
[68:38] just want to do it, let's just do it,
[68:39] let's talk about it." Well, one of those
[68:41] projects ended up turning into Noster,
[68:44] right? And Noster is a sovereign, the
[68:48] easiest way to explain it for anybody
[68:49] that's not on it is it's a decentralized
[68:53] uh sovereign Twitter basically, right?
[68:57] Uh the uh my signature, my keys like
[69:03] Bitcoin, the Bitcoin I own my messages
[69:06] is kind of the easiest way to say it,
[69:07] right? So if I post it, I can post it.
[69:10] people don't have to look at it, right?
[69:12] But they can't change it, they can't
[69:13] censor it, they can't take it down kind
[69:15] of thing. Um, and that's uh it's it's
[69:18] like my own private Bitcoin, but it's in
[69:21] messages, right? It's messages and files
[69:23] and things that I like to share, right?
[69:26] That was started just from
[69:28] somebody that's just like, "Oh, this
[69:30] would be kind of a fun project. I wonder
[69:32] if we could do this and use the same
[69:33] kind of protocol for sharing." Right?
[69:35] That was just a fun thing somebody was
[69:38] doing. Try to have try to do something
[69:41] fun for joy for yourself that has
[69:44] nothing to do with anything else because
[69:46] you'll be amazed at what kind of stuff
[69:47] can grow out of it. And worst case
[69:49] scenario is you just feel better when
[69:51] you go hit all the other stuff.
[69:56] And it's a it's a it's a great world. Um
[70:00] because now it's it's a little bit
[70:03] outside of Bitcoin, I think.
[70:06] But if you're really passionate about
[70:08] something, no matter what that is, you
[70:11] can probably make money with it on the
[70:13] internet somehow. There's probably
[70:16] there's probably a way you can monetize
[70:18] on that if you really enjoy that thing.
[70:22] But it's also good to sometimes have
[70:26] something and not thinking about the
[70:28] monetization of it. Like just just have
[70:31] something for the sake of it. So, I
[70:33] don't know. For example, I like to play
[70:35] chess. I'm not that good in it, but I
[70:38] really do like playing chess. And you
[70:41] you could we have ne next uh next
[70:45] podcast round we can do like one hour
[70:47] and have like a ch a chess game and talk
[70:50] to each other like a chess podcast. Love
[70:53] it. But the point I was trying to make
[70:55] is I'm not trying to
[70:58] make money with playing chess. I could I
[71:02] could whenever I play let's open my
[71:04] YouTube channel and and and talk with
[71:05] people on on chess like could be a
[71:07] successful format could make money uh
[71:10] and I could play in tournaments and get
[71:12] really good in it but I'm I'm not
[71:14] interested in that in it because I'm so
[71:16] competitive with everything else in my
[71:19] life and I'm still competitive when I
[71:21] play with other people in chess. Uh but
[71:24] I'm not obsessed with being the best in
[71:26] chess. I'm just like, oh, I have like an
[71:28] EL of like 8 900 and I'm okay with that.
[71:31] It's it's I'm I'm not I don't have to be
[71:33] a grandmaster in that. So, it's just an
[71:36] for me uh chess is almost like an art
[71:38] form. It's it's a weird way to describe
[71:40] it like that. I think I I watched um I I
[71:45] watched a [ __ ] how is it called uh The
[71:49] Queen's Gambit on on Netflix and and she
[71:51] also described bit Yeah.
[72:11] And she also described uh and she also
[72:13] described uh chess as an art form.
[72:25] Hey, sorry, Robin.
[72:28] Oh, no, no worries. No worries. You were
[72:29] saying you saw you were watching it on
[72:31] Netflix.
[72:34] Oh, yeah. Um I I just saw Netflix
[72:38] because she's also describing it as an
[72:41] as an art form. Uh I don't know how
[72:44] she's called. Beth, is that her name?
[72:48] The the the girl from the Queen Scam. I
[72:50] loved it. And and and it's it's it's
[72:53] really it's really great to to have that
[72:56] in your life. Um yeah, we have an endine
[73:00] in the podcast and it's kind of a an
[73:03] endine of the podcast
[73:05] that so we have the endine of the
[73:08] podcast where the previous guest is
[73:09] asking a question for the next guest
[73:10] without knowing who the next guest
[73:12] actually is. But the thing is uh we
[73:15] talked about that question actually
[73:16] today a lot but maybe you can add
[73:19] something to that uh and the the
[73:22] question from the previous guest is how
[73:24] has Bitcoin changed your life? Yeah. Um
[73:27] well I mean Bitcoin gave me
[73:32] uh
[73:35] really man so many ways I guess but
[73:38] um it kind of gave
[73:43] me my adventurous spirit back right like
[73:47] I had lost my willingness to do things
[73:50] learn new things go places all of it u I
[73:54] was just beaten down by the existing
[73:57] current system and
[74:00] uh
[74:02] Bitcoin magically uh literally pulled me
[74:06] into a job like a career that pulled me
[74:10] that I I was forced to do these things
[74:13] um which was great and then now
[74:16] Bitcoin by
[74:19] itself is has given me the means to do
[74:23] what I want. uh when I want, right? Um
[74:28] it's I'm not uh you know, I'm not to a
[74:31] point where it's just like, you know,
[74:32] I'm hopping in a jet and going all over
[74:34] the the planet yet. Uh maybe someday,
[74:37] but but I'm able to say, "Oh, no. Yeah,
[74:40] this is yeah, that's a fun project. I'm
[74:42] going to work on that." Or those are
[74:44] good people. I want to work with those
[74:46] people. or m I I really, you know, uh I
[74:52] I don't think I can make that a priority
[74:53] right now is my nice way of saying I
[74:55] don't want to work with you or I don't
[74:57] want to do that. Um and so giving me the
[75:01] ability to do that is
[75:03] probably really the the the lynch pin
[75:07] that the rest of my my life kind of
[75:10] revolves around, right? Um, most people
[75:13] don't have
[75:15] that that chance and Bitcoin G and I'm
[75:19] not, you know, super wealthy by any
[75:22] sense of the term, right? You'd probably
[75:24] be surprised at the amount of Bitcoin I
[75:26] actually have, but it is
[75:30] um that shift has given has made me
[75:34] realize, you know what, life is too
[75:36] short. Bitcoin gave me just enough
[75:39] cushion to make that switch and feel
[75:42] that way. Um to be able to decide how I
[75:45] spend my time, what I do, who I do it
[75:48] with, uh where I go, you know, whether I
[75:52] need to go or do something else, right?
[75:54] It's like um it's been interesting. Uh
[75:57] some of other people out there, maybe
[75:59] even, you know, close friends and stuff
[76:01] have been um they that they're like,
[76:04] "Oh, are you just are you getting rude?
[76:06] you know, are you get in your old age,
[76:08] are you getting crotchety and like angry
[76:10] and you know, you don't like to do? No,
[76:12] I and I'm not. Uh I just uh you know, I
[76:16] just no longer care to waste time with
[76:19] things that I feel are not important.
[76:22] And in the past, I hadn't been able to
[76:24] do that. uh in the past you you have to
[76:27] do I had to do so much just to keep um a
[76:32] job or keep the you know income or keep
[76:34] money flowing in to be able to pay for
[76:36] and all these things that kept coming at
[76:38] me and they're like oh you got to spend
[76:39] money on this spend money on this I I
[76:42] realized it was Bitcoin was the catalyst
[76:44] made me realize a I don't have to spend
[76:46] money on anything I don't want um and
[76:49] and I and it made me take a hard hard
[76:51] because of how valuable it is made me
[76:54] take a good hard look at what do I
[76:55] actually need? Right? I don't need
[76:58] everything that the world tells me I
[77:00] need. And then uh also looking at
[77:05] people, you're like, "Okay, well,
[77:07] Bitcoiners are great. Most, you know,
[77:08] most of them are great. Uh if someone
[77:10] comes to me as a Bitcoiner, I I will
[77:13] hear them out regardless of how
[77:15] ridiculous I think their plan or their
[77:16] idea is. I want to hear them out and see
[77:18] what they have to say. And then um if
[77:22] I'm going to work with them or or want
[77:24] to help them out, right, I know that
[77:27] we're already coming to the table with a
[77:30] certain
[77:32] shared value system uh because just
[77:36] because we're both in Bitcoin, right?
[77:38] That's a uh that's a
[77:40] huge
[77:44] uh I don't know precursor. say it's just
[77:48] it it completely weeds out it it it
[77:51] eliminates the requirements of weeding
[77:54] out all of the bad stuff. So much of it
[77:56] maybe about 80 or 90% of it is weeded
[77:58] out. You know, if you sit down with
[77:59] someone who is officially a Bitcoiner,
[78:02] the other 10% is you find out they're
[78:04] not a Bitcoin or Maxi, they're a
[78:06] shitcoiner also. And so you just got to
[78:08] be careful. But if they're in Bitcoin,
[78:10] then it's um
[78:13] uh you know, a lot of that those
[78:16] questions and red flags can
[78:18] automatically go away, which makes you
[78:20] more open to opportunities and more open
[78:23] to uh to uh learning and discovering new
[78:26] things. I think that's probably the
[78:28] biggest catalyst and that just filters
[78:30] out to all other parts of your life.
[78:33] I love that. I mean that that that's
[78:36] very true on so many different levels. I
[78:39] really love that. Thank you so much,
[78:41] David, for for being on the podcast
[78:42] today. It was was an honor. It was was
[78:44] really cool chatting with you. Um before
[78:46] I let you go, where can where can people
[78:48] find you and ask you questions? So I'm
[78:49] uh David Branskum uh on Twitter. Uh my
[78:54] handle there is uh Rebel in Texas with
[78:57] the B is a Bitcoin logo. So it might be
[79:00] kind of hard to find it that way if it's
[79:01] just David Bransk and find me. Um,
[79:05] that's probably the the best place. I
[79:07] haven't I haven't done any articles, but
[79:09] I need to start, you know, taking some
[79:11] of the things I've written down over the
[79:13] last three or four years, experiences
[79:15] and things, and starting to put that
[79:16] out. So, I hope to publish some of those
[79:18] things just through Twitter articles and
[79:20] and stuff like that. But, um, and then
[79:22] you can always, uh, email me directly.
[79:26] Um, I've got a pretty good filtration
[79:28] system. So if you want to if you want to
[79:30] email me directly
[79:32] davidhydropod h yd d r o pod.io
[79:36] um I opened up that domain. It's I don't
[79:38] think it's a functioning website but um
[79:41] I opened up that domain uh when I
[79:43] started doing hydro as well but you can
[79:45] always reach me directly that way if
[79:46] you've got you know a business idea or
[79:49] you want some help with a hydro or uh
[79:53] immersion mining project anything like
[79:55] that happy to help out.
[79:58] Really cool. Thank you so much, David.
[80:00] And also, thank you so much for everyone
[80:01] that is watching and listening for
