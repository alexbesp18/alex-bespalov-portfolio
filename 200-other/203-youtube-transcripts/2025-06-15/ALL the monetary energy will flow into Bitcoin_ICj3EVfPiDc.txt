[00:00] everything else is pretending to be
[00:01] money but Bitcoin is money we take over
[00:04] 80% of global debt all fiat currency a
[00:07] big chunk out of real estate big chunk
[00:08] out of stocks a good chunk out of gold
[00:10] Bitcoin is really good as a lens to view
[00:14] other Investments to understand kind of
[00:16] how money works you can look like a poor
[00:19] person going over a border and have
[00:21] millions in your head Bitcoin is number
[00:23] go up technology and houses our number
[00:26] go down
[00:28] technology Bitcoin is The Profit that's
[00:32] the kind of Paradigm that people come at
[00:35] me with all the time whenever whenever
[00:37] we do talk about money if that they're
[00:40] like so what's the profit what when are
[00:42] you going to sell how what price would
[00:45] it have to be for you to sell it's just
[00:48] they're used to this shortterm kind of
[00:52] where you have to sell something like I
[00:55] don't know like like when a stock has
[00:57] reached like if you bought it when it's
[01:00] early on and then it becomes in the
[01:02] Fortune 500 and then oh all the growth
[01:04] is gone now you have to sell it and now
[01:07] then you just buy the S&P at that point
[01:10] um Bitcoin I I think is that kind of
[01:13] index people don't view it as being that
[01:17] though and it's so big I can't even
[01:19] explain
[01:20] it but but over time you get that
[01:24] Paradigm Shift where it is it is like
[01:27] what you want to keep your profit in it
[01:29] is is the profit everything else you're
[01:32] selling for a profit and Bitcoin is what
[01:35] that
[01:36] is yeah Bitcoin is like the the exit
[01:39] strategy already like uh people ask me
[01:42] like oh what's your exit strategy
[01:44] because I came from a stock uh world I
[01:47] invested a lot in stocks before and
[01:50] there is like oh what's your exit
[01:51] strategy on the Tesla stock when will
[01:53] you get out and stuff like that and for
[01:56] Bitcoin Bitcoin is the exit strategy and
[01:59] and they also had I released yesterday
[02:02] the the the podcast with Duan and and it
[02:04] was an interesting one because he uh
[02:06] talked also about Bitcoin as a unit of
[02:08] account and that's basically the Mind
[02:11] shift that we are going through and he
[02:13] talked about the comparison oh um if you
[02:16] have a meter you also want to have a
[02:18] fixed length you don't want the meter to
[02:20] be from rubber and and change in length
[02:23] uh if you want to measure something and
[02:25] it's like Bitcoin is that measurement
[02:28] unit and is that kind of uh thing where
[02:32] we measure stuff in for people that are
[02:35] maybe newer like why is Bitcoin why can
[02:40] Bitcoin be that measurement thing why
[02:43] should like the world be in Bitcoin as
[02:46] the main store of value as the main unit
[02:48] of account like what what what does does
[02:51] it bring to to
[02:54] us I think Bitcoin is really good as a
[02:58] lens to view
[03:00] other Investments um to understand kind
[03:03] of how money works I don't think today
[03:06] is a great representation of the idea of
[03:09] what it could
[03:11] be or or just how you could use it to
[03:15] determine opportunity costs on other
[03:18] things like you have the fact that or
[03:21] the idea that it would last forever and
[03:24] everything else is losing scarcity
[03:25] against it so just that you could
[03:30] determine your opportunity cost on
[03:32] something like a house where you think
[03:33] it'll last a hundred
[03:36] years I don't know or like a business
[03:39] where you think it'll last 25 years so
[03:41] you have to that's like 4% opportunity
[03:44] cost per year just from
[03:47] that whereas you know the Bitcoin will
[03:49] stay and then you know that like every
[03:52] 20 years there's going to be a d the
[03:54] amount of businesses in the world is
[03:56] going to double the amount of homes in
[03:57] the world is going to go up by like 50%
[04:00] so that's another you add another few
[04:02] percentages and there's your opportunity
[04:04] cost so it's not super helpful to use
[04:08] bitcoin's price
[04:10] today the way it moves around as that
[04:13] kind
[04:14] of Baseline like opportunity cost for th
[04:18] other Investments but just kind of using
[04:20] it as a lens like of what it could be
[04:23] like just think as if your Fiat wasn't
[04:25] Fiat and it was Bitcoin like in a hyper
[04:30] Bitcoin isation post Society already
[04:35] yeah that's I think it's a great way to
[04:37] to look at it like Bitcoin as the lens
[04:39] for like a future unit of account uh I
[04:42] mean right now I talk with people from
[04:45] Salvador and it's interesting because
[04:47] they sometimes only have Bitcoin uh they
[04:50] are trying to keep dollars out and
[04:54] sometimes when they need it they just go
[04:56] to an ATM get some dollars and then uh
[04:59] they use it but it's like they are on a
[05:01] Bitcoin standard and they don't check
[05:03] the prices also I think uh when you are
[05:06] talking with Europe and American guys
[05:08] and like the Western world uh then
[05:10] you're like oh yes I check the price
[05:12] from Bitcoin and then we we talk about
[05:14] the the the pumps and uh the the Dums
[05:17] and bumps on the on the Bitcoin price
[05:21] every day on bitcoin Twitter and it's
[05:24] interesting to see that uh if you're on
[05:27] a Bitcoin standard and you make that
[05:29] mind switch to bitcoin it does not
[05:31] matter that much of course the price
[05:33] still fluctuates but longterm your
[05:36] purchasing bar is going up en norm and
[05:40] this shortterm swings is like you can
[05:42] manage it you can definitely manage it
[05:46] how did you actually find your way like
[05:47] you're young 24 years old uh and how how
[05:52] did you find your your way into into
[05:54] Bitcoin and how old were you
[05:57] then I was
[06:00] I just turned
[06:02] 21 um so it was right after Co I bought
[06:07] it in July 2020 it was like 9,000 it was
[06:10] just kind of a speculation I I just
[06:12] started investing period just started
[06:14] saving um I'd always worked a lot two
[06:18] jobs um but I I never like saved money
[06:22] or invested or anything so I was just
[06:23] like kind of spraying money everywhere
[06:25] at that time just working hard and um
[06:29] buying oil Futures buying like index
[06:33] funds Alibaba stock it was uh right
[06:36] after covid and I thought I I didn't
[06:38] know anything about investing but I
[06:40] thought it was just a good time to get
[06:41] in to Investments and I saw at that time
[06:45] Tesla stock was going way up and I saw
[06:48] Bitcoin was still below what it was in
[06:51] 2018 and I was like hey I don't know
[06:53] anything about this but this is probably
[06:55] going to rip since Tesla's ripping it
[06:57] just seems like the same kind of thing
[06:59] to me me and then it did and um I think
[07:04] so I bought it in July of 2020 and then
[07:08] kind of like the end of that year it hit
[07:11] hit all new all-time highs it was like
[07:13] 30,000 and I was like oh man well I
[07:16] guess that's it so I sold
[07:19] it and I as soon as I sold it Elon Musk
[07:22] bought and it went up to like 60 70 and
[07:25] I was like man I'm an
[07:27] idiot and I thought it would never back
[07:29] down I'm sorry did you then bought the
[07:32] top
[07:34] again
[07:35] uh no no I was I was uh I was buying
[07:38] like other stocks and I think I I did
[07:41] pretty well that year anyways without it
[07:44] it was just 2021 was just such like a
[07:47] crazy year for just speculative stocks I
[07:51] and then 2022 I just got crushed and i'
[07:54] read the Bitcoin standard listened to a
[07:56] bunch of podcasts um I would bought like
[07:59] physical gold and physical silver and I
[08:01] was like okay the systems [ __ ] so I
[08:04] mean I was really I actually had more
[08:06] precious metals than I did like Bitcoin
[08:10] and then then I had my a buddy of mine
[08:12] who was into all the cardos and the
[08:15] ethereums and stuff and he was getting
[08:16] me all into it in like
[08:18] 2022 and I I had like a physical
[08:22] precious metals so I'd learned about
[08:23] self-
[08:24] custody but not with like Bitcoin yet
[08:29] and um I think so
[08:32] 2022 uh Voyager collapsed it that was
[08:36] before like
[08:37] FTX right Voyager was my uh was my
[08:41] exchange my brokerage and
[08:45] um I had bought a ledger and I self-
[08:47] coded a bunch of my shitcoins and my
[08:50] Bitcoin um right before it collapsed and
[08:53] that was months before FTX so I got out
[08:56] just in time and I was trying to figure
[08:58] out how to stake all my all my ALT coins
[09:00] and I realized how stupid it was and how
[09:05] it like non-secure it was to try to
[09:07] stake all of I was trying to diversify
[09:10] in the crypto space and I was like wow
[09:12] this is really difficult to actually be
[09:14] Diversified and get my staking rewards
[09:17] for all these different things and I
[09:19] just like it just came onto Bitcoin then
[09:22] I sold all the stocks put it in Bitcoin
[09:24] sold the precious metals put it in
[09:25] Bitcoin and now I'm on a Bitcoin
[09:28] standard um yeah I've I've been totally
[09:32] Allin since like uh what the end of
[09:36] 2022 oh really so that was right right
[09:39] when FTX collapsed is when my right at
[09:41] the exact same time my um my
[09:45] uh confidence was at the all-time high
[09:48] it not yeah it was the perfect time
[09:50] actually yeah it was really good like
[09:52] end of 2022 now it's like up 100% if we
[09:56] measured in in US Dollars and I also
[09:58] think it's funny because uh a lot of
[10:01] people are like oh I want to diversify
[10:04] into more cryptos but what is
[10:07] diversifying really meaning like for me
[10:09] it's just uh diversifying you have to do
[10:13] because you want to delete internal
[10:15] risks for example you should not only
[10:18] invest in one company because that one
[10:20] company can go bad because of bad
[10:22] management of stuff like that um but you
[10:25] should also not like uh you can
[10:27] diversify like a five for 10 companies
[10:30] then then it's not that that all the
[10:33] companies will go down in one week or
[10:36] something like that if it's good stocks
[10:39] um but Bitcoin does not have those
[10:42] internal risks it has not there is no
[10:44] CEO there's no management team there's
[10:46] no exactly it's a commodity not a
[10:48] security so with the security you're
[10:51] always having to watch the earnings
[10:52] report it's like oh are they going to
[10:54] grow next one should I hold on is this
[10:57] going to be a good long-term one or they
[10:59] going to do something that was
[11:00] unexpected and now all the earnings are
[11:02] going to be going through the floor and
[11:06] now you have to sell this stock because
[11:07] now it's overvalued because they can't
[11:09] make profit anymore
[11:12] yeah I don't know
[11:14] man that's very true uh since you're
[11:17] young I guess you don't own a house
[11:21] now I don't own anything except for
[11:24] Bitcoin that's very good do you um plan
[11:28] to like uh in the future diversifying
[11:32] but not like a lot of bitcoiners still
[11:35] have this thing like I want to own my
[11:37] house and I think a lot of like they
[11:39] have Traditional Values they're like I
[11:41] want to also own my house and not only
[11:44] rent uh is it something that and I also
[11:47] think a lot about that because I'm I
[11:48] think I want to rent I don't I don't get
[11:51] the point of buying a house because for
[11:53] me it's more like a business and letting
[11:56] other people live in that house and
[11:57] getting the cash flow in in especially
[12:00] on a when we move out in a Bitcoin
[12:01] standard and there's like not that crazy
[12:04] appreciation in Bitcoin Bitcoin will
[12:06] outperform the the housing market um
[12:09] like how do you see investing in a house
[12:12] when you're like for 30 40 uh or you
[12:16] want to stay in Bitcoin
[12:19] only I mean it just doesn't make sense
[12:23] for I mean Bitcoin is number go up
[12:26] technology and houses their number go
[12:28] down technology relatively I mean it
[12:31] just does because they don't last
[12:32] forever they're all propped up with
[12:35] mortgages which are propped up with
[12:37] fractional Reserve
[12:40] banking
[12:42] um and then especially right now I mean
[12:45] I I look at the what it would be like to
[12:49] actually get a mortgage on a place and
[12:51] you're paying more for the mortgage than
[12:53] you are for renting the place I mean it
[12:56] just doesn't make sense at all I don't
[12:57] know maybe maybe someday but it wouldn't
[13:00] be for
[13:01] money yeah I also think like if if you
[13:04] want to buy a house it should be like an
[13:06] emotional value because like you want to
[13:08] own the thing that you live in uh and
[13:11] not because it makes financially sense
[13:14] uh I mean but that's not how people view
[13:16] it at all at all it's like it's a
[13:19] mandatory investment for the regular
[13:21] normal person it's like you have to have
[13:24] a home at some point or else you're just
[13:26] never going to have any
[13:27] money yeah I mean houses uh were a quite
[13:32] good investment back in the day but
[13:35] because we printed so much money and
[13:36] everything was a good investment except
[13:38] feat currency like you could have
[13:40] invested in ETFs in gold and in houses I
[13:43] mean you can could like I think houses
[13:46] are stupid investment because like most
[13:49] people cannot afford to buy their house
[13:51] really so what they're doing is making
[13:54] an a down payment and making the whole
[13:58] thing on based on credits and mortgages
[14:01] and then paying up those mortgages uh
[14:05] through like 30 4 years and they're
[14:07] basically like that dep slave uh in in
[14:10] the in the Fiat system where they have
[14:13] to work all the time to just keep up
[14:15] with the uh with the credit um paying
[14:19] and everything like it's it's it's a
[14:21] it's a it's a weird world to be
[14:25] in now houses houses are Commodities too
[14:29] just like Bitcoin is but what is in a
[14:33] commodity is the mortgage that props up
[14:35] the house
[14:37] value that's a
[14:40] security I think Commodities relative to
[14:44] Securities are going to do very well
[14:46] just because of the large amount of debt
[14:49] because I don't know I I can't even
[14:53] explain it very well I think I think if
[14:56] you're saving in gold or if you're
[14:58] saving in in Bitcoin houses are going to
[15:00] get cheaper to you the stock market's
[15:02] going to get cheaper to you
[15:05] because asset price
[15:08] inflation has benefited most where the
[15:12] credit can go and that's houses that's
[15:15] corporate debt and government debt so
[15:18] bonds I also noted down from from what
[15:21] you said like why you how did you find
[15:24] the way in Bitcoin um that you work two
[15:28] jobs
[15:29] uh and like you know 24 year old why are
[15:32] you working two
[15:34] jobs I just kind of always
[15:37] have I I did I knew I wasn't going to go
[15:40] to school I just had to make money and
[15:43] um
[15:44] I worked even harder when I started
[15:47] investing I was like oh okay I'm
[15:49] actually doing something this is my plan
[15:51] now I'm going to do something with my
[15:53] money and have it work for me and I
[15:54] didn't know how I was how I was going to
[15:57] invest at first I just I was really
[15:59] ambitious I learned a lot about business
[16:02] evaluations and like how to do uh
[16:06] discount cash flow models on stocks and
[16:09] stuff and then I was learning about gold
[16:12] and read the Bitcoin standard and now
[16:15] I'm all in Bitcoin but it just yeah I'm
[16:17] just very motivated to to retire
[16:21] early and I got a
[16:25] good I think bitcoin's the the best
[16:30] option biton is I think the best best
[16:33] retirement plan uh for for for people
[16:36] out there do you also run like a note
[16:39] and
[16:41] I mining
[16:44] Bitcoin no I'm not
[16:46] mining yes no I've never touched that I
[16:49] I run a node um I hold my own Keys I've
[16:52] orange pill my mom um very good so she
[16:55] she
[16:56] also she she does doesn't run a node but
[16:59] she has her own
[17:00] Keys
[17:02] um I haven't really done much about like
[17:05] with the interactions on the Note but
[17:07] yeah it's about it that's the extent of
[17:09] it got a few wallets different
[17:12] wallets utx home management important PE
[17:15] people don't talk enough about utxo
[17:17] management you shouldn't have utxos
[17:20] below a million sets I don't think
[17:23] because someday the fees are going to be
[17:25] that
[17:25] high yeah so consolidate
[17:29] consolidate but more and more people
[17:31] keep keep talking about it like I think
[17:33] it it CES up on it comes up to my my
[17:35] feet more more and also guests are
[17:37] talking about more and more I think it's
[17:40] it's slowly slowly slowly coming that
[17:42] people are talking about U or management
[17:45] uh and getting educated on it and get
[17:49] getting a little bit more into uh what
[17:52] is you take so management why do I have
[17:53] to care and stuff like that but what
[17:57] what is interesting for me because you
[17:59] said orange pill your mom is she like an
[18:02] actual Bitcoin or is she just holding
[18:05] Bitcoin as like oh I have an investment
[18:08] my son it's like a hedge for her not not
[18:10] like a not a maximalist like you or
[18:14] me but got a good amount how was your
[18:19] journey in Orange building her or maybe
[18:21] other people in your family and Frank
[18:23] group is it is it a hard hard uh thing
[18:26] to
[18:27] do
[18:29] um yes yes some people are easier than
[18:33] other people for sure there's so my mom
[18:37] I live with her right I pay her rent and
[18:40] I at a certain point I just stopped even
[18:43] like having any Fiat at
[18:45] all so I started um with strike I
[18:49] started getting direct deposits in
[18:51] Bitcoin so I literally just do not have
[18:54] Fiat um and I'm so I'm I'm paying my mom
[18:58] for the bills and stuff and I just don't
[19:01] have Fiat so I and I I talk about
[19:03] Bitcoin all the time so so you so she
[19:08] she started accepting it for the bills
[19:11] so and then I I got her I ordered her a
[19:14] Jade
[19:16] and that's amazing
[19:18] she's yeah and then she's just started
[19:20] buying on her own just cuz she does
[19:23] stocks and other Investments and stuff
[19:26] on her own anyway so she just added
[19:28] Bitcoin to that list of
[19:30] stuff I love it she has her own keys
[19:33] that you have your own circular economy
[19:35] uh in your family just like founded your
[19:38] own circular economy in your
[19:40] family that's amazing and um I don't
[19:43] know if you have cash app or you guys
[19:45] use cash app over there Jack dors yeah
[19:50] Jack dorsy cash app square block or
[19:53] whatever it is um most people here in
[19:57] the US use cash
[19:58] app and I think it's it's an amazing app
[20:02] because it's also lightning
[20:04] enabled so if I because I don't have
[20:09] dollars
[20:10] ever I I keep like 5% of my stack on
[20:14] lightning and um if I ever go out with
[20:19] other people and I cannot pay I I have
[20:22] them open up their cash app and I'll
[20:24] send them
[20:26] Satoshi to so that like a little orange
[20:30] pill um so where it's only with like my
[20:34] close friends that I have like already
[20:36] kind of been talking their ear off about
[20:38] Bitcoin it's because I love them they
[20:40] hate it but it's because I love
[20:42] them but but you live where do you live
[20:46] like America I guess uh Chicago Chicago
[20:50] and like can you live on a full complete
[20:53] Bitcoin standard uh is it is that
[20:57] possible
[20:59] yes so the way you do it is you have you
[21:05] keep what you need in
[21:07] um on lightning and you can use bit
[21:11] refill or the Bitcoin company which is
[21:13] even better because it's it doesn't
[21:15] support alt coins and you buy Visa gift
[21:19] cards and you you get a little bit back
[21:21] you get like 1% of your Bitcoin back it
[21:24] covers the lightning fee and then some
[21:27] and then you could put put that on your
[21:29] Google pay or your Apple pay and you can
[21:31] do tap to pay but it it takes like 5 10
[21:34] minutes whenever I want to do a
[21:35] transaction it's kind of a pain in the
[21:38] ARs so it stops me from spending but I
[21:42] don't now I if if I I was the one paying
[21:46] the mortgages and stuff here or paying
[21:49] the rent or whatever no I couldn't do it
[21:51] I would have to sell some Bitcoin for
[21:54] Fiat and then I would have to wait for
[21:55] that to clear it takes like business
[21:58] business days multiple business days so
[22:00] I would have to use a bank account for
[22:01] that but I just I you know I I send it
[22:04] to my mom on the main
[22:08] chain so I don't know I just I I'm able
[22:11] to get by but I don't think it's
[22:13] completely possible to be without a bank
[22:16] account yeah but that doesn't mean you
[22:17] have to keep your reserve your
[22:19] individual Reserve currency in Fiat you
[22:21] could just sell for what you need and
[22:23] then you can use that for your bills I'm
[22:26] super excited toing announced that this
[22:29] podcast got the first ever sponsor 21
[22:33] Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one and
[22:36] did teach and preach self- custody this
[22:39] is my goto exchange when someone asks me
[22:42] oh where can I buy my Bitcoin from this
[22:45] is the easiest entry for bitcoiners and
[22:48] if you want lower fees Plus at the same
[22:51] time support this podcast use code Robin
[22:54] and click the link in the description
[22:56] yeah I also think so like when you you
[22:58] have uh all your net worth in Bitcoin
[23:03] and just keep like maybe one month or
[23:05] two months of spending in a Fiat wallet
[23:09] uh that's basically living on a Bitcoin
[23:11] standard like if if you have 99% plus uh
[23:16] of your net worth in Bitcoin you cannot
[23:20] say that you're living on a US dollar
[23:22] standard you're living on a Bitcoin
[23:24] standard uh you're just using uh the you
[23:28] forced to use from the government it's
[23:31] like it's still a Bitcoin standard for
[23:34] me uh and it's not just the government
[23:37] forcing you it's also just the network
[23:39] effect that you don't have with Bitcoin
[23:42] there is the network effect that we
[23:43] don't
[23:44] have when will this come you've got the
[23:47] Euro I got the dollar yeah when do you
[23:50] think will will this network effect
[23:53] starting to really uh come like you now
[23:57] made a little circle economy with your M
[24:00] El Salvador is starting to to build
[24:03] something but even there you cannot pay
[24:05] everywhere with Bitcoin uh in this in
[24:07] Swiss there is Lugano where you can pay
[24:10] almost everything with with with Bitcoin
[24:13] in swis you can even pay some taxes in
[24:16] in some districts uh like that's sick
[24:20] yeah there's there's a lot going on in
[24:22] the world in in in Bitcoin uh and it it
[24:25] gets better and better like and know I
[24:28] think it's t the Cardon in in in Swiss
[24:33] but you cannot pay all the taxes in in
[24:36] Bitcoin but some of them are actually
[24:38] allowing it and it's like it gets more
[24:41] and more but it's still so early kind
[24:45] of uh like when do you think will this
[24:50] uh Point come where we are all of the
[24:53] sudden oh [ __ ] Bitcoin is uh coming
[24:55] close to being a unit of account and
[24:57] being being our standard medium of
[24:59] exchange or at least we can we have the
[25:02] option to uh in every city there are
[25:06] some stores I can get my haircut with
[25:09] Bitcoin I can get some drinks with
[25:11] Bitcoin not all the stores but like is
[25:13] in Salvador when you get uh when you
[25:17] know your way around you get things uh
[25:20] with
[25:21] Bitcoin I think the they it was the
[25:24] Intolerable minority thing where you
[25:27] have to have over 4% of a population be
[25:30] really intolerant about a certain thing
[25:32] and then every the whole population
[25:35] accepts it I heard about that on Robert
[25:38] breed love um so he says about
[25:42] 4% whatever that means 4% of all assets
[25:45] 4% of all money value maybe is a magical
[25:50] number um also it's just how much pain
[25:54] people will have to have people are are
[25:56] dumb man
[26:00] I don't know man it so the the more the
[26:03] the more the main chain gets adopted we
[26:06] need to see lightning and liquid and all
[26:08] these layer twos really build out from
[26:10] where it's at or the CTV or whatever is
[26:13] going to happen I don't know
[26:15] um I I don't know if that happens I hope
[26:20] it does certainly hope
[26:22] so but it even if if that scenario
[26:25] doesn't happen I'm still bullish I'm
[26:28] super bullish on
[26:30] it yeah I think uh even uh like right
[26:36] now we're in like the phase where we
[26:38] adopt Bitcoin as a store of value uh and
[26:42] this phase will is going on for a long
[26:45] time and will go on for so much longer
[26:48] and people will start to use it as a
[26:51] medium of exchange and unit of accounts
[26:53] slowly slowly but 4% also heard that
[26:57] that magical number but I think we're so
[26:59] far away from that 4% because uh even if
[27:04] let's say 2 3% of the world population
[27:06] is now holding Bitcoin somewhere around
[27:08] that uh how many people are actually
[27:13] bitcoiners how many people are actually
[27:16] running nodes being bitcoiners having
[27:18] the Bitcoin in s custody of global net
[27:22] worth maybe so what is that that's like
[27:26] a it's like a 400x from here no wait
[27:30] we're like
[27:32] 0.15% right now so 10 times would bring
[27:35] us to 1% no it's like a
[27:38] 40x yeah from
[27:40] here in in like in World in global
[27:44] wealth terms not in Fiat terms in global
[27:47] wealth terms which goes up faster than
[27:50] than the dollar goes
[27:51] down or whatever your Fiat goes down
[27:55] yeah we have had this this this I think
[27:57] it's 900 trillion uh US Dollars all over
[28:00] the the world where we have the All the
[28:03] Gold in there all the real estate all
[28:06] the financial markets in there and it's
[28:11] I always see that and I'm like there's
[28:13] no reason why Bitcoin cannot capture a
[28:16] significant amount of that of course he
[28:19] can capture everything because there is
[28:22] some value in companies there is some
[28:24] value in Gold there is some value in
[28:26] real estate of course so it will not
[28:28] capture
[28:29] everything but an really significant
[28:32] amount do do you have a number where
[28:34] like oh I think it's 40% or 30% just
[28:38] that like you have a number in mind
[28:40] you're like this is the number what I
[28:42] think Bitcoin can capture from
[28:46] everything I think the easiest ones are
[28:49] the the things that have no intrinsic
[28:52] value like uh like gold or
[28:56] bonds just your bonds are worth way more
[28:59] than just the physical currency
[29:01] itself bonds are like 95% of Fiat and
[29:05] then the last 5% is Bank Reserves and
[29:07] physical
[29:08] currency when whenever you do a
[29:11] transaction it's it's just it's already
[29:13] digital most of the time you're using
[29:14] your card or your Apple pay or something
[29:17] so I think that's like an easy place to
[29:20] start and once you start to understand
[29:22] that oh everything else is propped up by
[29:24] debt so half of Real Estate maybe a
[29:27] third of the stock market in the
[29:30] world
[29:32] um uh
[29:33] so
[29:36] bonds what you get historically you get
[29:40] paid like 5% over the last 100 years the
[29:43] average on US treasuries US Government
[29:46] debt you get paid about 5% but the the
[29:50] credit Supply is expanding 10% that
[29:52] whole time per year so it's like holding
[29:55] Bitcoin but you lose 5% if your Bitcoin
[29:57] every year that's exactly what the bond
[30:01] is it's just it's a worthless thing but
[30:04] the numbers it's like it's like an
[30:05] optical
[30:07] illusion it's it's a ledger where the
[30:10] the the supply is expanding but you're
[30:13] the amount you're getting is not keeping
[30:15] up with it the amount you're getting is
[30:17] like half of the expansion so I don't
[30:20] know I I think we take over if if Global
[30:23] debt is three or four times GDP
[30:27] it needs to be under GDP for it to even
[30:31] keep up with Bitcoin as an
[30:34] investment so I think we take over like
[30:37] 80% of global
[30:40] debt all fiat currency a big chunk out
[30:43] of real estate big chunk out of
[30:45] stocks maybe a good chunk out of gold
[30:49] think 30 30% of global assets
[30:53] 50% yeah I think that's like it's so
[30:56] hard to imagine those numbers it's it's
[30:59] like uh when you you when you think
[31:01] about it and we're now so small and and
[31:05] and Bitcoin is still so freaking early
[31:09] and coming to those numbers will be just
[31:13] crazy do you do do you think Fiat can
[31:16] survive or how long could it be Global
[31:20] wealth is going to last
[31:22] forever but individual currencies that
[31:26] are security because they have an issuer
[31:29] are going to
[31:30] die inevitably every single individual
[31:34] currency just like every business goes
[31:36] out of business over time so maybe Fiat
[31:40] a different Fiat will exist a thousand
[31:42] years from now but it won't be the
[31:43] dollar it won't be the Euro it'll be
[31:45] something else if it if it is even
[31:48] needed at that point I don't know but I
[31:50] think there's a good chance there's no
[31:52] more fiat
[31:55] currency I have uh um I thought about to
[31:59] they have something new on the podcast I
[32:01] don't know if I continue it or not um a
[32:04] small fire round where there's like free
[32:06] questions uh you can answer you can
[32:10] answer them with yes or no as like it's
[32:13] you can answer them with just one word
[32:15] you can
[32:17] also uh talk more about them if you want
[32:20] um and the first question for you is
[32:22] like is Bitcoin just money
[32:25] yeah I asked question a lot because uh
[32:31] it it changes sometimes people's life a
[32:34] little bit like it's like they have a
[32:36] mind shift with Bitcoin because then
[32:38] they start all of the sudden think about
[32:41] stuff critical like this the the the
[32:44] question oh what is the Federal Reserve
[32:46] doing what's the the the government
[32:49] doing what's what what's all this and it
[32:52] kind of starts some sometimes with
[32:54] Bitcoin but the end of the day yeah
[32:56] you're right it's just money it's just a
[32:57] tool I think everything else is
[32:59] pretending to be money everything else
[33:01] is pretending to be money but Bitcoin is
[33:04] money that's amazing
[33:08] line um second question could Satoshi
[33:12] stop
[33:14] Bitcoin no is he G to change change my
[33:18] node I already downloaded it I
[33:19] downloaded Bitcoin core he can't get me
[33:21] to change it what what do you think will
[33:24] happen like I think it's uh unrealistic
[33:26] and I think he will not come back but if
[33:30] or he she uh if he comes back what do
[33:34] you think will will happen for like the
[33:38] first year and like the next five years
[33:41] then a bunch of bunch of
[33:45] noise not the signal I'm he can't trick
[33:49] me into changing my node unless it'd
[33:52] have to be like really convincing I
[33:53] don't know it would be a lot of noise it
[33:55] would be hard the the last one is
[33:58] interesting it's uh I posted this about
[34:02] unit of account with satosi and and
[34:05] Bitcoins and there were like more and
[34:07] more comments coming up oh but bits
[34:10] should be used like not
[34:13] satosi are you on on team bits or
[34:17] SATs what is a bit that's 10 SATs H it's
[34:20] it's 100 sets apparently oh okay I
[34:25] whatever
[34:27] I mean someday I mean that's going to be
[34:30] the that's going to be the block subsidy
[34:32] someday in like a hundred years from now
[34:34] one set is going to be the block subsidy
[34:37] So eventually we're going to have to
[34:38] figure out how to make it even smaller
[34:40] and then after that even
[34:42] smaller and it's G it's going to
[34:44] accelerate how small that we're gonna
[34:46] have to keep making it it's going to be
[34:49] just it doesn't matter what unit it is
[34:52] because it's going to keep getting
[34:53] divided and it really what matters is
[34:56] you own a percentage of the supply and
[34:59] the supply is going to stay the same or
[35:03] Shrink yeah and it's it's I think unit
[35:08] bias is something that's holding bitco
[35:13] holding people a little bit back and
[35:14] they're like oh [ __ ] I only have
[35:18] 0.01 Bitcoin like it doesn't matter it's
[35:22] like it's it's just it's just uh you
[35:25] have the whole thing 100%
[35:27] and you have a percentage of that and
[35:29] then you lay units on top of that and
[35:33] could easily be also like 100 million
[35:35] Bitcoin or like 10 million Bitcoin uh
[35:38] this does not change anything just just
[35:41] keep stacking sets yeah for our
[35:44] lifetimes you shouldn't even I don't I
[35:47] don't think you should even be involved
[35:48] in Bitcoin if you can't have a million
[35:50] SATs because if it's not a million sets
[35:53] you can't self- custody it eventually
[35:56] it'll be frozen and um if if you're that
[36:00] if you're not even able to afford it I
[36:02] don't think you should even be in
[36:03] Bitcoin because it's just going to be an
[36:04] IOU maybe someday when we're if
[36:07] lightning gets better but if you do have
[36:10] less than a million sets and you and you
[36:13] pass it down enough Generations
[36:15] eventually it will be usable
[36:18] again and it will be a Hu even a huge
[36:21] amount a million sets I think at some
[36:24] point uh when you think about that
[36:27] uh the whole thing like 2.1 quillion
[36:31] sets I think it is when you calculate
[36:33] with the whole Supply uh and this
[36:36] divided this the whole world divided by
[36:39] that even a million sets will be
[36:41] something uh that will be an in crazy
[36:44] amount and I mean it's an interesting
[36:47] question like when you have not a lot of
[36:48] money uh and you you can maybe like save
[36:52] one or $ two dolls every month should
[36:55] you get involved in Bitcoin I still
[36:58] think you should like start your journey
[37:00] because uh it's it's better to have an i
[37:04] you Bitcoin then have nothing at all I
[37:08] think uh and just like keep stacking and
[37:11] maybe you're like improve maybe you
[37:12] learn about it maybe you have a higher
[37:15] skill and then you can have like maybe
[37:17] like some point like 500 to like 100 500
[37:21] to a, Euros or dollars in Bitcoin and
[37:24] then you can take the self cly of course
[37:26] when you have 10 10 10 euros in
[37:31] Bitcoin does it really make sense to do
[37:33] self- custody like probably they un
[37:35] spendable probably the yeah if that is
[37:39] you if if you're one of the few people
[37:42] that that that describes you should only
[37:45] use exchanges that support lightning and
[37:49] you should
[37:50] withdraw over lightning instead of the
[37:52] main chain whatever your small amount is
[37:55] and you should probably have a bunch of
[37:58] different wallets you should diversify
[38:00] across lightning wallets and then you
[38:02] can consolidate them once you have like
[38:05] like cumulative amount of a million SATs
[38:08] and then you can withdraw that to the
[38:09] main chain don't use exchanges that
[38:13] don't have lightning support lightning
[38:15] support's super
[38:17] important yeah
[38:19] 100% um now we're coming to our uh end
[38:24] routine uh in it's an interesting
[38:27] question I almost want to I will
[38:30] incorporate that question I think in
[38:31] future podcast in the beginning
[38:35] um the question from the previous guest
[38:37] for you is what's the situation in in
[38:40] your life where you felt Bitcoin made
[38:42] actually a difference or Bitcoin was
[38:44] really needed uh in in in your
[38:49] life uh just number go up I
[38:53] guess that's what it is it's number go
[38:56] up
[38:58] isn't it uh more like
[39:00] everything all the other numbers go down
[39:02] oh number go down yeah yeah yeah
[39:06] everything else is number go down
[39:08] technology it's like I'm not in it for
[39:11] the number Go technology I am out of
[39:14] everything else because the go down
[39:18] Technologies I mean the freedom part is
[39:20] also big I think a lot of people
[39:24] oh someday
[39:27] someday if everybody's on bitcoin you
[39:31] you can evade taxes and they can't take
[39:34] it from you you can just keep evading
[39:38] your taxes and you just have your words
[39:40] in your head you go to prison and they
[39:42] never get the Bitcoin from
[39:44] you they can't stop you I mean I mean
[39:47] how do you how do you have high taxation
[39:51] in a world where everybody's on
[39:53] bitcoin that's that's changing things
[39:56] things
[39:57] someday yeah that's crazy to think about
[40:00] you can just take your Bitcoin over
[40:03] every border with just remembering some
[40:06] words in your
[40:07] head like imagine how this is changing
[40:12] everything from like Wars and fleeing
[40:15] countries and where you like because if
[40:18] you uh flee a country usually you end up
[40:21] with nothing in the in the Final
[40:23] Destination because they take it from
[40:25] you from the borders you cannot carry it
[40:29] your bank is not working they froze your
[40:31] assets stuff like that uh so you
[40:34] basically only have the the things that
[40:36] you have on you but now you can have
[40:38] Bitcoin in your head and you can look
[40:40] like a poor person going over a border
[40:43] and have uh millions in your head that's
[40:47] that's a crazy thing to think
[40:49] about you can you can evade taxes and
[40:52] evade a bunch of different fines that
[40:54] you have and then come to the US and
[40:56] being a legal Citizen and you're good
[40:58] you're not going to get deported here
[41:01] and you got all this money it's it's
[41:03] crazy to think about um yeah thank you
[41:06] for being on and uh I love to chat with
[41:09] you sick dude thank you this is
[41:13] [Music]
[41:15] awesome
