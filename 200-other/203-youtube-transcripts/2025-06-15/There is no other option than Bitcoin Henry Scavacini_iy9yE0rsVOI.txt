[00:00] people will start to look into Bitcoin
[00:02] more and more because they'll have no
[00:04] option cash is devaluing exponentially
[00:06] and that's for the whole world do you
[00:07] think money printing is theft yes it it
[00:11] absolutely is theft is the definition of
[00:13] theft Bitcoin is the perfect ruler for
[00:15] humans to measure things it's giving the
[00:17] power back to the people humans deserve
[00:19] to live in Peace and Freedom Bitcoin is
[00:22] here to fix the problems of human manage
[00:24] it's akin to fire it's akin to
[00:26] electricity being discovered invented
[00:28] it's akin to Motor Vehicles it's akin to
[00:30] flight that interconnected the whole
[00:32] world memorize your seed so you can be
[00:34] truly
[00:35] Sovereign you told me before we we
[00:38] started recording uh about high school
[00:40] and you said something that is really
[00:43] really resonated with me you said High
[00:45] School felt like prison to you yeah when
[00:50] in fact when I have nightmares you know
[00:52] sometimes you have nightmares I wake up
[00:55] you know like oh I'm so relieved because
[00:57] my nightmare was a scenario where I was
[00:58] in high school you you know and it's not
[01:00] I love my friends I had so much fun with
[01:03] my friends after school I started
[01:05] skipping class hanging out with all of
[01:06] them playing sports but the boring part
[01:10] was the subjects that the teachers were
[01:12] teaching and God blessed them they did a
[01:15] good job but I felt like it wasn't
[01:17] something that I loved you know how did
[01:20] you come out of that like you said like
[01:22] you started then working in a roofing
[01:25] company yeah so my buddy's dad had a
[01:28] roofing company um that point of my life
[01:31] I was already doing kind of part-time
[01:32] work every other day in a little uh a
[01:36] little market where you know convenience
[01:38] store for Latinos and so one day my
[01:41] buddy's dad walks in and he's like hey I
[01:43] need someone to work because that's
[01:45] where people advertise in those bodegas
[01:47] you know and I told them huh ruie I
[01:51] think I want to work you know and the
[01:53] very next weekend I was up there in the
[01:55] roof with them nailing you know cleaning
[01:57] the ground and making much better money
[02:01] yeah I think we like we underestimate
[02:03] what freedom is and uh if if you find
[02:05] Freedom when we do something we love and
[02:08] I think we we talked about before we had
[02:10] the podcast with Gary Gary V uh Gary V
[02:13] Gary kadon uh uh recently and you talked
[02:17] about like if you just do it for the
[02:19] money if there's no nothing else on the
[02:22] purpose like you don't enjoy it uh you
[02:24] don't have a a greater fuel like you are
[02:26] basically just like a [ __ ] right it's a
[02:30] little bit uh rough to say but it's
[02:32] basic for me it's true when you only do
[02:34] it for the money I mean for a temporary
[02:37] state of time it's okay I think because
[02:39] if you like if you need the money if you
[02:41] have a temporary stuff but you should
[02:42] work towards something which leads me to
[02:45] my first actual question how free do you
[02:47] think we are like what what do you see
[02:49] is the current state of of of freedom
[02:51] and maybe in the western world where
[02:53] where we are living uh do you see also
[02:55] like a war on freedom a war on privacy
[02:59] uh with with the stuff going on for sure
[03:01] man I think as the states growing it it
[03:04] keeps increasing and it never decreases
[03:06] until a major catastrophe happens and it
[03:08] sucks to see but um with the new
[03:11] technologies I'm very hopeful because
[03:13] people you know information is all
[03:15] decentralized now you know we see the
[03:18] instead of people watching the major
[03:19] propaganda news channels where back in
[03:22] the 50s and 60s everyone sat down at
[03:24] night after school after work and they
[03:26] watched one channel and then there were
[03:28] three channels and everybody watched
[03:29] those channels and they talked about it
[03:31] the next day so the propaganda Outlets
[03:34] would say whatever the nation had to
[03:36] believe in and so that that's what they
[03:38] believed that now we have what a dozen
[03:41] or two dozen different uh platforms like
[03:44] YouTube Rumble Rock Fin and a bunch of
[03:47] different ones too and within those you
[03:49] have millions of channels really and you
[03:53] know such as yours and people consume
[03:55] what they love so people are happier so
[03:57] I think I'm very hopeful for the future
[03:59] future but to answer your questions
[04:01] about government um expanding I think
[04:06] that there is a general war on
[04:09] freedom because everybody want wants to
[04:12] impose their world view in other people
[04:14] and I was guilty of that myself and so
[04:17] you know when I was a Bible thumping
[04:19] Christian I my teenage years I started
[04:21] going to church and read the Bible every
[04:23] day was obsessed with Jesus and which is
[04:26] very good I'm very grateful because that
[04:28] gave me some morals to live by I got
[04:31] married when I was my teenage years with
[04:33] my wife you know we had her children
[04:35] within wedlock and yada yada all the
[04:37] stuff I don't I don't judge if you if
[04:39] you don't choose to live that lifestyle
[04:40] but everyone wants the political power
[04:44] to impose their worldview and other
[04:46] people when we could just Live and Let
[04:48] Live you know and that's what I think
[04:50] you know it's that's what it stems from
[04:52] I think how do you define Freedom like
[04:55] uh what what what is freedom for you wow
[04:58] that's an amazing question question um
[05:01] Freedom okay um it
[05:04] is you doing what you love without ever
[05:08] hurting other people you know that
[05:10] that's the main point of the American
[05:12] Constitution it is the only job of the
[05:15] government is to protect life and
[05:17] property everything outside of that is
[05:19] an
[05:20] unnecessary you know ministry as they
[05:23] call it um but it keeps expanding
[05:26] because people want to you know put more
[05:29] things in
[05:30] place and it's also interesting for me
[05:33] when uh when we talk about we want to
[05:35] protect you and I think the government
[05:37] always uses the excuse oh we have to
[05:40] protect there's some craphy there's
[05:42] something going on there's some crisis
[05:44] and they always are like we have to
[05:46] protect it but at some point we have to
[05:48] say also like oh it's okay if something
[05:51] fails in that regard like uh all like
[05:55] there's an interesting debate that I had
[05:57] recently with belts in in in
[06:01] cars like if you don't have your like in
[06:03] a I don't know where it is uh like how
[06:06] it is with with you uh in your country
[06:08] but when in Austria when you don't have
[06:10] the belt like the seat belt uh tucked in
[06:13] in your car and uh police officer stops
[06:16] you you get a fine for that every sorry
[06:20] goad yeah and and and and this is
[06:22] something where I'm
[06:24] like I can choose myself uh if I have
[06:28] the seat belt on or not
[06:30] because the only person that I can hurt
[06:32] is myself for me it's Freedom ends there
[06:36] where the other person's Freedom starts
[06:39] because of that I cannot drive like with
[06:43] 200 kilomet per hours through the city
[06:45] because chances are really high that I
[06:47] hit someone and murder someone so there
[06:49] is where Freedom that's why uh uh speed
[06:53] control makes sense in areas where there
[06:55] a lot of people you should not drive too
[06:57] fast because you will hit someone
[07:00] someone will die but if you don't have
[07:02] your seat Bel on it's just yourself like
[07:05] you will die maybe if if something
[07:07] happens but it's just your freedom and
[07:09] this is area where the government don't
[07:12] has to be in there but sorry what what
[07:15] what did you want us to say I agree with
[07:17] that man that's such an enlightening
[07:19] statement I um because you're not
[07:21] hurting other people that's exactly what
[07:23] freedom freedom is you know as long as
[07:25] you're not hurting other people
[07:27] destroying their property then it's it's
[07:30] ultimately your decision you know um
[07:33] here um in America we have different
[07:36] states that they make different
[07:38] legislations for each and the federal
[07:40] government overrides anything if they
[07:42] have to um if they want to or whatever
[07:45] reason um but in my state Connecticut
[07:48] for example is you have to have a seat
[07:51] belt they say click it or tick it you
[07:54] click at or ticket to incentivize people
[07:56] to wear their seat bels and um the one
[07:59] thing here in Connecticut is that you
[08:00] don't have to wear a helmet you know
[08:03] that's the only thing that you don't
[08:04] have to do like if you're riding a
[08:05] motorcycle and you want to be without
[08:07] your helmet you're free to do so but
[08:09] yeah there are little tiny examples of
[08:11] that all over the nation in every
[08:13] State's different U thankfully which
[08:15] makes me very happy about States
[08:18] legislating their own Bitcoin rules
[08:21] that's why I want the federal government
[08:22] out of Bitcoin if your state doesn't
[08:24] want it fine but for example Texas uh
[08:28] what was that state that just um
[08:31] embedded in in their state law that you
[08:34] have the right to mine and run Bitcoin I
[08:37] forgot the state uh was it Delaware
[08:40] anyway no it wasn't Delaware but anyway
[08:43] that
[08:44] state became the Trailblazer on making
[08:47] Bitcoin law to give to give the freedom
[08:49] to embed it in the their constitution to
[08:52] say that people are have a right to
[08:53] bitcoin and it's it's pretty obvious
[08:56] they shouldn't you know we shouldn't
[08:57] have to make laws about that because
[08:59] Bitcoin is speech it's code code is
[09:02] speech was deemed speech during the um
[09:05] the Clinton area era the American courts
[09:07] rule that Bitcoin is speech and that
[09:09] everyone have freedom of expression and
[09:12] speech so Bitcoin is is a constitutional
[09:15] right 100% And this is something that
[09:19] not a lot of people uh um think about
[09:22] when they say like oh but what if the
[09:24] government bans it if the government
[09:27] actually bans Bitcoin they are actively
[09:29] Banning Free Speech not that they did
[09:32] not try it like they they tried it I
[09:34] think the first time was 2013 with with
[09:37] China and since then we have every year
[09:40] some examples of some state or Nation or
[09:43] city or whatever trying to ban Bitcoin
[09:46] like this is We on constant a DEX now Al
[09:50] with with Samurai wallet uh and what was
[09:53] out Phoenix wallet which was taken off
[09:55] the US uh App Store so like we have
[09:58] constant small and bigger attacks on
[10:01] bitcoin on privacy on freedom but I
[10:04] think as long as we we stick together as
[10:07] a as a freedom group and and keep
[10:10] fighting for that and which also leads
[10:12] me to my next question it's it's it's
[10:15] will be great it will be good and I
[10:17] talked with that a few weeks ago also
[10:19] with someone even if we lose Bitcoin
[10:24] somehow we are connected digitally
[10:27] everybody and we know we want some money
[10:29] we know we want freedom we will find
[10:31] some other way we will spin something
[10:34] other something else up like it's not
[10:36] about Bitcoin it's about sound money and
[10:38] it's about Freedom uh and of course
[10:41] Bitcoin is perfect for that and I think
[10:43] Bitcoin will succeed but even if it's
[10:46] not we can still fight it for it like
[10:49] and and this is something why I'm so
[10:51] passionate about it because I made the
[10:53] mindset switch from it's about Bitcoin
[10:56] no it's about the principles of Bitcoin
[10:58] and Bitcoin is the Perfect Tool the
[11:00] perfect vehicle for that uh and that's
[11:03] why we are so passionate about Bitcoin
[11:04] this Bitcoin only conferences are not
[11:07] Bitcoin only conferences there are
[11:08] Freedom conferences for me yeah that's
[11:10] true and and that's that's something
[11:12] even way bigger than than than Bitcoin
[11:16] uh and it's it's it's really cool uh and
[11:18] I'm right now I'm planning in a book
[11:22] where I'm uh having like what I learned
[11:25] from Bitcoin uh and I write a lot about
[11:28] that also like about the freedom State
[11:30] and what what we can do in that H but my
[11:33] question for you sorry to talk so much
[11:36] uh my question for you is um you write a
[11:40] lot with like with Bitcoin fam under the
[11:42] comments uh uh you you obviously have
[11:45] this tribe and Community thinking a lot
[11:47] in you and which is which I find amazing
[11:49] and really cool how important is that
[11:52] like how important is that group
[11:53] thinking that that we are fighting in a
[11:56] tribe for freedom and what's the
[11:58] reasoning behind writing so much Bitcoin
[12:01] family on the on the post of of of us
[12:04] all yeah so what brought me to bitcoin
[12:08] was number go up you know I remember
[12:10] putting money in and then my money
[12:12] quadrupled I was like whoa what is this
[12:15] you know it even startled me which made
[12:17] made me want to learn more and more it
[12:20] it's ultimately to answer the question
[12:22] is what attracted me to religion you
[12:24] know a family you know um a community a
[12:28] sense of community of protection and of
[12:30] providing protection and encouraging
[12:33] edifying each other that's what religion
[12:35] does it's embedded in human genome and I
[12:38] feel like we're not fighting for a
[12:39] specific tribe but we're fighting for
[12:41] the entire human race that's my fashion
[12:44] humans are so beautiful humans deserve
[12:47] to be equal humans deserve equal
[12:50] opportunity I should say uh humans
[12:52] deserve to live in Peace and Freedom
[12:55] that's why I don't even like to talk
[12:57] about wars because it it re my inside
[13:00] it's so sad what what happens because of
[13:02] these tyrants and UL ultimately it's
[13:05] these tyrants trying to fight against
[13:07] Bitcoin try to pass anti- Bitcoin laws
[13:10] and yeah we also have tyrants here in
[13:11] America they keep trying to impose their
[13:13] worldview on other people that's why I'm
[13:15] very open to any Culture open to many
[13:19] civil to to any ideas you know I keep my
[13:23] open mind and I analyze what's good and
[13:25] what's bad and take the good from it and
[13:26] leave the bad
[13:27] aside what what made me not be so
[13:31] intense of a Christian anymore it was
[13:34] when I met a man called Abdullah um he
[13:37] became a very good friend of mine and I
[13:40] remember just you know chatting with him
[13:43] and learning you know listening his life
[13:45] to his life story and he is also an
[13:47] immigrant here um I remember I remember
[13:51] saying wait the they're human too you
[13:54] know and it's such a a terrible thing to
[13:57] say because sometimes when you're locked
[13:59] into one specific group or tribe you
[14:02] kind of you isolate the rest of other
[14:05] people so what I think Bitcoin will
[14:08] bring for everybody in the world is
[14:10] prosperity because it's a deflationary
[14:13] money that tyrants cannot inflate Banks
[14:17] can't manipulate it you know it's
[14:19] decentralized it's available 247 for
[14:22] everyone across the globe I could send
[14:25] you a Bitcoin transaction right now go
[14:27] like that especially in light right in
[14:29] the in the speed of light and so that's
[14:32] what the beauty of Bitcoin is it's
[14:33] bringing people together like music you
[14:35] know like religion religion brings
[14:37] people together and music and dancing
[14:40] and just you know Bitcoin is that Force
[14:45] that's bringing all of humanity together
[14:47] in Freedom liberty and prosperity that's
[14:51] so beautiful wow uh really really cool
[14:54] um you you said you you immigrated to to
[14:57] to America too yeah my mom yeah my mom
[15:00] brought me here when I was very little I
[15:02] barely remember Brazil um yeah so
[15:05] originally from Brazil I was born there
[15:07] but my ancestors are all Italian from
[15:09] both sides both sets of grandparents
[15:11] they're all Italian it's that's why this
[15:14] that's the last name is scavini but um I
[15:17] have family who goes there every year
[15:19] it's you know they they I I got to go
[15:20] some point but I've been focusing so
[15:22] much on work that uh you know I I never
[15:26] have time to go on vacations and stuff
[15:28] and it's expensive too man if you think
[15:29] about I'd love to go visit Europe I I
[15:32] want to go to the land of my ancestors
[15:34] that's Northern Italy you're not too far
[15:36] from there are you I'm really close to
[15:38] Northern Italy because Austria is above
[15:40] Italy and Austria is really small uh
[15:44] like I'm in Italy in maybe a 2hour car
[15:47] ride I'm Northern Italy oh nice that's
[15:50] awesome so yeah my my family is all from
[15:52] there and uh it's beautiful but on the
[15:55] other hand when my parents
[15:59] I don't want to it I want to leave a
[16:02] legacy for my children you know and
[16:04] Bitcoin is just a perfect vessel for
[16:06] that because it's only going to spread
[16:09] especially like new podcasters making
[16:13] new Bitcoin content I think from day to
[16:16] night one day you're going to have
[16:17] hundreds of thousands if not millions of
[16:19] listeners because everyone will come to
[16:21] bitcoin when they realize what it is
[16:24] it's so simple it's digital scarcity and
[16:26] people are going to flock to us so all
[16:28] the podcasters will do well Bitcoin
[16:30] number obviously is going to go up
[16:32] forever because it's perfectly or
[16:34] ultimately scarce it's even more scarce
[16:37] than gold so it's going to be great for
[16:40] everyone I think amazing and and and do
[16:43] you have like uh from Brazil I thought
[16:47] that you are from Italy because your
[16:48] name sounds Italian like I I can spot
[16:51] Italians really great already had a few
[16:54] Italians on the show and and you came
[16:58] from like did not came you like you were
[17:00] basically born in in America but you
[17:03] your your mother came from Brazil like
[17:05] how did this end
[17:06] up yeah so she she was a lawyer in
[17:09] Brazil and she once she grew up she
[17:11] realized what Brazil was and that's why
[17:14] I never have any kind of Brazilian hubis
[17:18] because I'm not it's not my culture
[17:20] ultimately I didn't grow up there I grew
[17:22] up here America is my culture but she
[17:24] came here for a better life you know
[17:25] Brazil is very poor it's not a proc
[17:28] prous countries like Europe America you
[17:32] know Canada Australia everybody wants to
[17:34] be in those countries because the
[17:36] economy is so great and you open any
[17:38] business it's amazing I have a side
[17:40] hustle with my wife you open any
[17:42] business and it booms especially if you
[17:45] focus your your your energy and your
[17:47] time in it did you business just grows
[17:50] here and just like Europe too Australia
[17:52] it's all it's all like that it's great a
[17:53] thriving Pro prosperous economies and
[17:56] Brazil the the the most important thing
[17:58] I think though she came here is because
[18:00] Brazil isn't safe it's murder rates
[18:03] through the roof uh drug trafficking the
[18:06] wars on drugs they have firefights all
[18:08] the time uh you know gunfights all this
[18:11] all the time in the streets it's not
[18:12] like close to Mexico at least in
[18:14] southern Brazil where where I was born
[18:16] it's mostly Italians and Germans there
[18:18] I'm 10% German too according to my DNA
[18:21] test but um I've always had a question
[18:24] sorry I don't mean to to deviate from
[18:26] the subject but so do austrians consider
[18:30] themselves Germans or I'm sorry please
[18:32] forgive my
[18:35] ignorance um austrians definitely don't
[18:37] consider themselves uh Germans it's like
[18:41] um I mean like Germans and Austrian are
[18:44] really similar people especially there
[18:47] is in Germany there's Bavaria which is
[18:50] really big it's bigger than Austria
[18:52] itself and they're really close to the
[18:55] culture of Austria also the further you
[18:57] go to the northern Germany the thir the
[19:00] culture difference from Austria I mean
[19:02] it's the same people it's it's they have
[19:04] a similar living standard they have a
[19:07] similar infrastructure they have similar
[19:09] laws they have uh almost the same
[19:11] language because German and Austrian
[19:13] German is the same language but but it's
[19:16] just a little bit dirtier I in a it's a
[19:19] little bit maybe maybe dirtier is the
[19:23] wrong word but uh it's it's a dialect
[19:25] it's it's a different version of the
[19:27] German uh so uh they're quite similar uh
[19:31] and I lived in in in Germany for one and
[19:34] a half years uh and yeah it's it's of
[19:38] course there differences but there's
[19:39] also differences when you live in
[19:41] different parts of Austria even though
[19:42] Austria is so small uh so people are
[19:45] different uh and uh I think it's it's
[19:48] it's it's uh it's a nice like I prefer
[19:52] Austria uh just because in general I
[19:55] think Austin is a little bit more chill
[19:59] uh you have this when it's a little bit
[20:01] nor to the more to the South uh people
[20:04] get a little warmer the weather gets
[20:07] warmer people is is are not so strict
[20:10] with stuff and uh and you can also see
[20:13] that uh constellation uh with North
[20:17] Germany and South Germany which is
[20:20] really interesting to see uh and yeah
[20:23] it's it's but in general like uh they
[20:26] are quite the same same people but of
[20:28] course they nuances to to that but yeah
[20:30] it's it's it's interesting and but if
[20:32] you're in Italy if you make the Europe
[20:34] CHP you definitely have to come to
[20:35] Vienna Vienna is the capital of Austria
[20:39] uh and some studies claim it's the best
[20:42] city on Earth I don't think it is I
[20:44] don't know but like I've heard that
[20:46] before yeah it's like the like they
[20:49] measure like infrastructure clean water
[20:51] stuff like that and and a Vienna is
[20:53] really good in that like Vienna has like
[20:55] really good infrastructure clean water
[20:58] stuff like that and I'm actually moving
[20:59] to Vienna in in one and a half months uh
[21:02] so like if you're ever in Vienna just
[21:04] hit me up we definitely can uh we can
[21:07] then actually make an inperson uh um uh
[21:11] podcast to do that yeah that'd be
[21:14] awesome man that'd be awesome I dream
[21:15] about going to Europe it's so beautiful
[21:17] the castles everything but the the
[21:20] similarities between culture too I I've
[21:23] done two DNA tests um 23 me and family
[21:25] tree DNA I remember when they gave me
[21:29] the results I was surprised because um
[21:32] they don't call it Genetically speaking
[21:35] with tribes and people they don't call
[21:37] it Portugal and Spain they call it
[21:40] Iberia because at some point they were
[21:42] one group of people and genetically
[21:44] they're identified as one group of
[21:45] people that's why they don't say you're
[21:46] either Portuguese or Spaniard you are
[21:49] Iberian you know when they give you the
[21:50] DNA test which is really cool to see how
[21:53] the world is merging man it it fills my
[21:55] heart with joy because when you look at
[21:57] it
[21:59] after the airplane was created invented
[22:02] by the brilliant R
[22:04] Brothers you can see the travel Maps now
[22:07] especially nowadays and you can see
[22:09] there's a website where you can see the
[22:11] increase of travel as more planes were
[22:13] built more routes were you know more
[22:15] routes were made with airplane travel
[22:19] it's beautiful now cuz you can't even
[22:21] see the globe with how many airplanes
[22:23] there are in the air you know when it
[22:24] comes to that that specific map it's so
[22:26] beautiful and people are visiting each
[22:28] other people are intermarrying I'm sure
[22:30] there's somewhere in someone in Asia
[22:32] right now saying hey I would love to go
[22:34] to Austria you know and then they get
[22:35] there they marry a beautiful alram
[22:37] person and or in the same way an
[22:40] Austrian or a German or an Italian say
[22:42] hey I would love to go to Asia you know
[22:44] somewhere random place it's a really big
[22:46] continent and then they do that and they
[22:48] get married that's you know people
[22:50] travel now and people are more
[22:52] intraconnected and thanks to the
[22:54] Internet it's amazing man this magical
[22:56] box right here I could talk to you my my
[22:59] Bitcoin logo right there I could talk to
[23:02] you you know at the speed of light and
[23:05] we can share ideas with each other edify
[23:07] each other you know I can take some of
[23:09] your Austrian culture you can take some
[23:11] of my American culture and it's really
[23:14] nice how the world is this is why War
[23:16] just wrecks my heart man it's something
[23:18] that we really need to end it and I I
[23:21] love Jason P Low's book about um soft
[23:24] War I know I'm sorry it's very um
[23:27] controversial some people don't like it
[23:29] some people say he's a spook that's fine
[23:31] you and you're entitled to he opinion
[23:32] God bless you but I think it's great
[23:35] because it more and more people are
[23:38] going to make war in Bitcoin with hash
[23:40] rate and it's going to be and we're
[23:42] watching that as we speak we can't see
[23:44] it because we're puny humans we're tiny
[23:46] and we don't see the grand scheme of
[23:48] things like we think in a 80 years
[23:50] lifespan you know 90 years lifespan
[23:52] because that's when we're born raised
[23:54] and pass away but Bitcoin is thing
[23:58] thinking well Bitcoin doesn't care but
[24:00] when we think about Bitcoin it's the
[24:02] grand scheme of things you know hundreds
[24:04] and thousands of generations that are
[24:06] going to come and go and benefit from
[24:08] Bitcoin and Bitcoin I think is going to
[24:10] cause World Peace too one of there's
[24:12] several reasons why Bitcoin is PE pure
[24:14] peace it's because people will hash it
[24:18] out you know as we say in America hash
[24:20] it out um they'll instead of fighting
[24:23] the the actual physical Force they'll
[24:25] fight with hash rate and also the
[24:27] Liberty Freedom that it provides for
[24:29] people it's Priceless it's completely
[24:32] Priceless because people can travel they
[24:35] can memorize 12 to 24 words and I have
[24:37] mind memorized I'm very proud of that
[24:39] and I encourage all I encourage if
[24:40] anything today that you're getting from
[24:42] this podcast I encourage that you
[24:44] memorize your seed so you can be truly
[24:47] Sovereign and the way I record my seed
[24:49] plate sorry sorry I'm going everywhere
[24:51] the way I record my seat plate is I
[24:54] record the first 11 words and the 12th I
[24:58] leave it out you know and I I put it on
[25:01] myself as my responsibility to memorize
[25:04] it and recite it every day when I'm
[25:06] working driving I'm I'm thinking full
[25:09] attention in the road but I'm also
[25:11] reciting my words you know very quietly
[25:14] and so that embeds your Bitcoin in your
[25:16] brain and now God forbid something
[25:18] happens I have nothing but my person my
[25:21] children my wife we could go anywhere
[25:24] and start fresh and new and that's the
[25:26] beauty of Bitcoin too so parents can't
[25:28] put a gun to your head and say hey give
[25:30] me your Bitcoin first of all that's
[25:32] anti-constitutional but second of all
[25:34] it's just impossible you can say hey man
[25:36] I was in a dirt bike accident in
[25:38] Nebraska in the cornfield I'm sorry I
[25:40] lost it all you know and it's true how
[25:42] can they prove that my reading that's
[25:44] the that's asite that's ridiculous so I
[25:47] think truly thank God for Bitcoin man
[25:50] yeah and you you touched on so many
[25:52] great things uh right there and I think
[25:54] with brain wallet I think the the most
[25:57] amazing but you still have it on a seat
[26:00] like on a plate or something like that
[26:02] like uh because I think this is
[26:05] important to mention because some people
[26:08] might say like oh great great I have it
[26:10] in a in my brain wallet uh then
[26:12] something happens to their brain or like
[26:14] they forget it or whatever and then they
[26:16] don't have it anymore so like it's it's
[26:18] really good to memorize your seat FR and
[26:22] you should definitely 100% do that like
[26:25] it's it's great that you doing that uh
[26:27] there are even like like I encourage
[26:30] people if you can make a story with it
[26:33] or kind there like so many great ways
[26:37] you can memorize your seed phrase um
[26:40] don't speak it out loud don't write the
[26:42] story down somewhere there are cameras
[26:44] everywhere nowadays cameras and and mics
[26:47] listening to people don't never say it
[26:49] out loud yeah and and and and definitely
[26:53] don't save it anywhere online like don't
[26:55] write it in like some drafts or like
[26:58] some some online Bo oh my God yeah that
[27:02] reminds me of that gentleman and and anx
[27:05] Twitter it broke my heart man when he
[27:07] told this his story you know I don't
[27:09] even want to repeat it it's awful but
[27:11] somebody basically hacked into the
[27:13] Google Drives or whatever and took more
[27:16] than 20 Bitcoin and it's heartbreaking
[27:18] heart-wrenching and he's just a champ
[27:20] man he goes to show how Bitcoin no
[27:21] matter what makes people hopeful joyful
[27:25] Blissful it makes people that's how
[27:28] we're meant to live you know according
[27:29] to religion we're supposed to be happy
[27:31] and be grateful to God and Bitcoin just
[27:33] helps you with that because it makes you
[27:35] truly joyful because you're self-
[27:37] Sovereign and you're free and you have
[27:40] true Liberty but yeah it's very
[27:41] important to write it down absolutely
[27:44] yeah 100% And you Al also mentioned
[27:46] softw War uh the book I I could not read
[27:50] it till now it it bother me that I did
[27:52] not read it actually uh but uh I I
[27:57] definitely plan to do it
[27:58] uh and what resonated with with that
[28:01] book with you like I uh I heard a lot
[28:04] about that I heard a lot about uh what
[28:07] different people think about it I think
[28:10] it's another great way to explain
[28:12] Bitcoin like definitely this is uh it
[28:15] definitely resonated with a lot of
[28:17] people but what did resonate in that
[28:19] book with you the most so that's the
[28:22] beauty of Bitcoin too Bitcoin isn't just
[28:25] one thing it's a million things to
[28:27] billions of of different people just
[28:29] like the internet you know for Me Maybe
[28:31] internet is for work for my daughter
[28:32] it's for school for my wife it's for
[28:35] work for you know it's for some families
[28:39] who are immigrants it's their means of
[28:41] communication with their family and it's
[28:42] beautiful that they communicate now but
[28:45] just like the internet Bitcoin is many
[28:47] things to many different people um I
[28:49] read only part of the book to be honest
[28:52] what I really enjoyed was breed Love's I
[28:54] I recommend everybody check out breed
[28:56] love the what is money show
[28:58] and I listen to the whole sailor series
[29:01] many times and sailor is brilliant he's
[29:04] amazing and I listen to the um Jason
[29:07] Lowry podcast the full series as well
[29:10] and I went back and actually played it
[29:12] back several times very slowly so I
[29:14] could capture everything and then um so
[29:18] my favorite part is basically Bitcoin is
[29:20] peace you know it's it's a kind of um
[29:23] it's an online War that's going to Quail
[29:27] the um human inclination for power so
[29:30] people are going to fight in the Bitcoin
[29:32] network instead of
[29:34] actually killing each other um
[29:38] physically so that that's the beauty of
[29:40] Bitcoin for me that's what I got from
[29:42] that book specifically there are many
[29:44] other things that don't come to mind now
[29:46] but it's it's really it's a great series
[29:48] and people should listen to it yeah and
[29:51] I think uh breed love sailor series I
[29:54] think he started his podcast with that
[29:57] that's an absolute M watch like this is
[29:59] something like that it's like the
[30:00] Bitcoin standard it's like one of those
[30:03] if you want a deep dive in Bitcoin like
[30:05] this is where you have to go uh and what
[30:09] I wanted to ask you like I think 10
[30:12] minutes ago or something like that where
[30:14] we drifted off uh we talked about the
[30:18] great countries with the Western
[30:20] countries like America Europe Canada
[30:22] Australia and stuff like that uh and you
[30:25] said that there's a lot of prosperity
[30:26] there and i' and I feel like it's still
[30:29] true but I also see a little bit of
[30:32] change there when we see for example as
[30:34] Salvador we see other countries that are
[30:37] coming slowly up and and giving people
[30:40] more safety there more freedom there uh
[30:43] do you see or even like we have more and
[30:45] more examples where also people in in
[30:48] big cities in in in prosperous countries
[30:51] are not safe because there's also um
[30:55] yeah there's also like crime going on of
[30:57] course not comparable to other ones and
[31:00] also like when we talk about salvad and
[31:02] stuff like that they they started from
[31:03] the bottom like started from the bottom
[31:06] now they fighting the way up but how do
[31:08] you see this this whole world Game
[31:10] Theory now uh playing out and and it's
[31:13] like where do you see it it going yeah
[31:16] it's funny that the lives of bitcoiners
[31:18] is actually better than TV it's better
[31:22] than Netflix because we're watching the
[31:24] world play out we're watching history
[31:26] and we know we're watching it and you
[31:28] can see it live every day that's why I
[31:30] like I love the fact that I speak
[31:31] several languages so I can listen to
[31:34] different channels a different time get
[31:36] gets different and get different world
[31:38] perspectives but um El Salvador is a
[31:42] perfect example right people they
[31:46] migrated here Mass migration from El
[31:49] Salvador here to America and now they
[31:51] found that people are staying there more
[31:53] after NAU actually made the street safer
[31:57] but that's the incentives when you know
[31:59] when you change in humans have a
[32:01] specific nature and there's no changing
[32:03] human nature that's what communism tried
[32:05] to do they pretend human nature isn't a
[32:07] thing human greed isn't a thing and they
[32:09] try to implement forcefully something
[32:11] terrible that ends up ends up in
[32:13] hundreds of millions of death so the
[32:15] beauty of Bitcoin is that it latches on
[32:18] to human nature and it makes the whole
[32:21] society better as an example naib buuk
[32:24] started imprisoning gang members now
[32:27] they have
[32:28] prisons filled with those gang members
[32:30] and the streets all of a sudden are safe
[32:32] for law-abiding people for good family
[32:34] people now they're walking more often in
[32:36] the street the kids are playing and the
[32:38] Commerce is way better there's no um
[32:40] racketing there's no you know um
[32:43] blackmail when it come there probably
[32:45] still is somewhere but for the most part
[32:49] I mean he made El Salvador go from one
[32:51] of the most dangerous country to the
[32:52] world of the world to the safest one of
[32:55] the safest countries in the world can
[32:57] you believe believe that it wasn't na it
[32:59] was the incentives of Bitcoin and um I
[33:03] think that's a a small example they're
[33:07] Trailblazers for what it's going to
[33:08] happen to countries in Africa countries
[33:10] in Asia you know there some places in
[33:13] Africa it's warlord after warlord and
[33:16] it's very sad people don't understand
[33:18] why Africans go to Europe on mass mass
[33:21] migration because Europe is beautiful we
[33:23] should be um flattered because we you
[33:27] know are
[33:28] our countries are much safer that's why
[33:30] they're coming here so I do have a lot
[33:31] of compassion to for people who get on
[33:34] boats and just go you know they put
[33:37] their lives at risk to to be somewhere
[33:39] beautiful safe where they can be happy
[33:41] but I think now with Bitcoin Bitcoin is
[33:43] going to change the incentives Warlords
[33:45] are not going to be able to have power
[33:47] because money is power and money is
[33:49] issued by said Warlords and money is
[33:51] issued by the banksters they're in bed
[33:53] with and the beauty of Bitcoin is that
[33:56] people it's going to be Grassroots it's
[33:58] going to be natural again playing with
[33:59] that human nature it's going to go from
[34:02] bottom to up for everybody it's going to
[34:04] be Grassroots that people are going to
[34:05] adopted there already are if you look at
[34:07] I just posted a um an image on X Twitter
[34:11] and it showed the um I think I got it
[34:14] from you actually that Africa map that
[34:17] has the um all the what do you call the
[34:20] Bitcoin ecosystem that's growing you can
[34:22] see it's booming everywhere now and um
[34:25] it's going to spread naturally and
[34:27] people are going to be safer because
[34:29] they can just leave with their Bitcoin
[34:30] you want to take my house fine you want
[34:32] to take my gold fine whatever I don't
[34:33] even have any gold anyways everything is
[34:36] in my brain you know they're not going
[34:37] to say that but expressing that and
[34:39] they'll just move and they'll leave so
[34:41] the tyrants will eventually be taken out
[34:44] of power and actual good people are
[34:46] going to be in leadership positions and
[34:49] that's what Bitcoin does it's beautiful
[34:50] because it's the opposite of Communism
[34:53] actually Bitcoin I say it's the antidote
[34:54] to communism because it's impossible for
[34:56] a state to come to at your money I love
[34:59] saying this and I posted it so many
[35:01] times like sound like a broke record but
[35:02] it's because it's true Bitcoin is
[35:05] uninflated by banksters Incorruptible by
[35:08] politicians it's decentralized Works
[35:11] 247 every single day for anyone in any
[35:15] geographical location of the world so
[35:17] people can just take their things and
[35:18] say all right goodbye man I'm going and
[35:21] they have everything in their brain and
[35:23] that's what I think Bitcoin is
[35:25] generating more a a safer world less
[35:28] less um Asylum seeking migration from
[35:32] dangerous places as those places become
[35:34] safer with Bitcoin and people who might
[35:37] not know or study Bitcoin they might say
[35:39] oh this is crazy he's saying uh Bitcoin
[35:42] is a cure all end all it's not that it's
[35:45] because when you actually know what
[35:46] Bitcoin is it's a decentralized ledger
[35:49] throughout the globe and that's pretty
[35:50] much what humans have been using for
[35:52] hundreds of thousands of years it was
[35:54] ledgers where it was the those large
[35:56] Stones where they etched things and who
[35:58] own what part of the stone that's what
[36:00] Bitcoin is and it's verified by hundreds
[36:03] of thousands of nodes
[36:05] worldwide and so it can't be it's
[36:09] immutable it can't be changed by or
[36:11] manipulated by anyone be it uh a hacker
[36:14] or be it a tyrant it's immutable that's
[36:18] the beauty of Bitcoin it it makes me so
[36:20] happy man H that's that's amazing and I
[36:23] think this is what Bitcoin solves like
[36:26] or like differently asked is that what
[36:28] Bitcoin uh is the main thing what B
[36:31] Bitcoin fixes is property rights
[36:33] bringing uh for 8 billion people the
[36:36] right to actually have their own
[36:38] Financial energy is that the main thing
[36:41] that Bitcoin fixes and all those other
[36:43] things are just consequences of it yes
[36:46] yes and the consequences of Bitcoin are
[36:48] all beautiful but that's yeah that's the
[36:50] main thing it fixes giving people their
[36:53] freedom and liberty back yeah amazing
[36:56] and I think this is uh this is very true
[36:58] and really really beautiful what you
[37:00] just said um and you mentioned I
[37:02] remember in the early that you also uh
[37:05] very passionate about religion and that
[37:07] you're passionate about religion and I I
[37:10] observed that with a lot of my podcast
[37:12] guest that they are in uh in religion a
[37:17] lot um what do you think is the
[37:20] connection there like why why are people
[37:23] um obviously not everyone in Bitcoin is
[37:26] religious not everyone in bit is
[37:27] Christian not every like obviously but I
[37:30] see a great value uh comparison there
[37:35] what where do you see the the connection
[37:37] between Bitcoin and religion or is there
[37:39] even one yeah I've I've pointed it down
[37:42] to and I've thought about this that's a
[37:44] great question man
[37:45] um basically what religion is doing is
[37:49] first of all it's embedded in the human
[37:51] DNA people who say that religion is bad
[37:54] no it's literally embedded in our DNA if
[37:56] we don't worship God we're going to
[37:57] worship the son if we don't worship the
[37:59] son we're going to worship our car if we
[38:00] don't worship our car we're going to
[38:01] worship a woman or vice versa and
[38:05] so the beauty of bit the beauty of
[38:08] religion is that it is a natural thing
[38:11] and the whole point of it this is where
[38:13] it connects to bitcoin religion is only
[38:15] trying to bring um harmony with Society
[38:19] so instead of fighting humans will be
[38:20] more united because we are a social
[38:22] creature after all religion just it's
[38:24] the glue that glues people together and
[38:27] if brings people together and you can
[38:29] see that in almost two billion Muslims
[38:31] and you can see that in almost I forgot
[38:33] how many billion questions is it almost
[38:34] three billion now I forgot um something
[38:37] like that but you can see it brings
[38:39] billions of people together as one one
[38:42] thought one mind and the beauty of
[38:44] Bitcoin it that's the next thing Bitcoin
[38:47] is gluing Hinduism Christianity Judaism
[38:51] Islam into one family that's why I say B
[38:55] BTC fam because we're one people we're
[38:58] all the same genetic sequence we're all
[39:01] the same species we're the same race
[39:04] that's the beauty of Bitcoin that's
[39:05] bringing people together and also if
[39:08] people some people want to be isolated
[39:10] by all means take your Bitcoin and go
[39:12] you know whatever but I I think that the
[39:14] world is merging and it's inevitable and
[39:16] Bitcoin is what bringing is what is
[39:18] bringing all religions together it's the
[39:20] ultimate Peacemaker it's the ultimate
[39:22] glue of society even though um some
[39:25] Christians might say oh you're not
[39:26] really a question
[39:28] I have Bible verses memorized I spent my
[39:31] my teenage years with my face in the
[39:33] floor praying for hours my mom remembers
[39:36] I met my wife she still goes to church
[39:38] four days a week she's a she prays every
[39:41] night we read the Bible together every
[39:43] single night without missing a heartbeat
[39:46] we read the Bible together I read it for
[39:48] my children so yeah I'm a Christian you
[39:50] could say but above all I'm a human and
[39:52] Bitcoin is just bringing humans together
[39:54] it's fixing the the issues of of the
[39:57] world when it comes to Warfare and
[39:59] fighting and uh building up on that how
[40:03] do you imagine then uh Bitcoin standard
[40:05] looking like if we are not like a
[40:07] special group an elite group where we
[40:09] have Bitcoin but it's like the whole
[40:12] world has Bitcoin in some extent like as
[40:15] a store value or they're using it for
[40:17] transactions whatever they're using but
[40:19] we are kind of in a Bitcoin standard is
[40:22] is is the world changing is the world
[40:24] coming closer together because of that
[40:26] or what what does it CH how do you
[40:28] imagine a Bitcoin standard looking
[40:31] like yeah um so and obviously I don't
[40:34] think it's going to change tomorrow you
[40:36] know people are not going to merge in
[40:38] within a generation or two I think it
[40:40] takes hundreds of years but Bitcoin is
[40:42] the is the great push you know it's the
[40:45] great um the great winner for Humanity
[40:49] it's the ultimate trophy that we will
[40:51] have to be able to when they expend to
[40:53] Outer State I know this sounds woooo but
[40:55] eventually Humanity wants to inoculate
[40:57] other habitable planets but for that we
[40:58] need to travel at the speed of light and
[41:01] but if people stop fighting they'll have
[41:03] more Leisure Time to invent to be more
[41:06] constructive when humans get together we
[41:09] construct beautiful things and so the
[41:11] way I think Bitcoin is going to play out
[41:14] in society I think it's very simple it's
[41:16] um it's going to be a ledger you know um
[41:20] let's say I go to Austria and I stay in
[41:22] your house I'll change the ledger to say
[41:26] hey um 1 million Satoshi the Bitcoin
[41:29] blockchain will change 1 million Satoshi
[41:31] will send from Henry's wallet to Robin's
[41:34] wallet and now you have 1 million
[41:36] Satoshi because you provided a service
[41:38] for me or a good whether you fed me or
[41:40] whatever but any you name the millions
[41:43] and trillions of examples that it could
[41:45] be people exchanging goods and services
[41:47] exchanging value Bitcoin is just going
[41:50] to be a ledger it's switching value here
[41:52] switching value there it's going from
[41:54] place to place without uh centralized
[41:58] middleman party like that we like to say
[42:01] here in America cut the middleman just
[42:03] cut the middleman go straight to the to
[42:05] the source that's what Bitcoin does with
[42:07] money it cuts off the tyrants it cuts
[42:10] off the people trying to control us and
[42:12] it makes humans be in harmony with each
[42:15] other it synchronizes the human race
[42:17] together wherever you want to live
[42:19] wherever you want to be it brings people
[42:21] together in a way that they're not going
[42:23] to fight over resources anymore because
[42:25] they can just Exchange it exchange uh
[42:29] goods and services with Bitcoin so it's
[42:33] that's the great equalizer I told you a
[42:35] lot about 21 Bitcoin the best place for
[42:38] me to buy Bitcoin directly on a Bitcoin
[42:41] only exchange but now let's talk about
[42:43] how to secure your Bitcoin once you got
[42:46] Bitcoin you don't want to leave them on
[42:47] Exchange you want to take self custody
[42:51] you want to take responsibility of your
[42:54] own Bitcoin that's why I recommend
[42:56] getting bitbox bitbox is an amazing
[42:59] wallet where you can not only keep your
[43:02] Bitcoin in a simple way very secure you
[43:05] can even create a passphrase with that
[43:08] passphrase you can basically create a
[43:10] hidden wallet on the device itself make
[43:14] sure to buy your bitbox in the link down
[43:17] in the description and with code Robin
[43:19] you even get a 5% discount when you
[43:22] think about your Bitcoin story and when
[43:24] you think about what what we all what
[43:26] what we talk talked about now in the
[43:28] last like 45 minutes when we are on the
[43:31] on the podcast what do you think Bitcoin
[43:34] taught
[43:35] you uh that we now did not talk about
[43:38] like what what do thing you get got from
[43:41] Bitcoin uh that we did not talk about
[43:44] till now yeah I'm so sorry my older one
[43:47] got home they're making noise now but
[43:48] yeah uh things that we did not talk
[43:50] about now um wow it's been 45 minutes
[43:54] already oh my God this is so fun I I
[43:56] didn't even I thought it was like five
[43:58] minutes that's beautiful man
[44:01] um what we did not talk about let's see
[44:06] it's it's taking power away from tyrants
[44:10] even though we already talked about that
[44:12] um there's so many things now I'm going
[44:13] to be working tomorrow and I'm it's
[44:16] going to come to M I'm going to be like
[44:17] oh why didn't I mention this in the
[44:19] Robin S podcast you know oh man things
[44:22] are going to go down in value you know
[44:24] goods and services are going to go back
[44:27] to uh how does Jeff Booth put it the
[44:29] Commodities go back to their um value of
[44:33] production how is it he says I forgot I
[44:35] forgot how he said about I think utility
[44:38] value you can say that everything is
[44:40] going down to the to the value they
[44:42] should be and this is something very
[44:45] true and I think especially with housing
[44:48] people will recognize that housing will
[44:50] be affordable once they start adopting
[44:53] Bitcoin because you have this beautiful
[44:55] chart where you see houses and then you
[44:57] see the different years they were in uh
[45:01] and then you see the dollar prices and
[45:03] then you see the Bitcoin prices and you
[45:05] see that houses obviously is a better
[45:07] store of value than dollars of course
[45:10] like dollars are printed so much houses
[45:13] cannot keep up with that printing uh and
[45:16] and even though they are getting worse
[45:18] even a bad house that gets worse over 10
[45:21] years will be worth more because of the
[45:24] excess excessive money printing but then
[45:28] we come to bitcoin Bitcoin is the
[45:30] scarcest asset the the best asset on on
[45:33] planet Earth the best place for your
[45:35] financial energy and in measured in that
[45:39] houses are crashing since 2009 and they
[45:43] keep crashing and keep crashing uh and
[45:46] this is something beautiful not because
[45:49] uh it it it boils down there the the
[45:53] investors of real estate or something
[45:55] like that it's just beautiful because it
[45:57] makes housing affordable it makes
[45:59] housing uh accessible for everyone again
[46:03] and this is I think this is the the the
[46:06] most exciting thing uh for the next like
[46:09] 10 20 years I'm looking forward that
[46:11] Bitcoin actually makes things uh
[46:14] affordable again if you adopt the
[46:16] Bitcoin standard if you don't adopt the
[46:17] Bitcoin standard you will see a bitcoin
[46:19] price you will regret it uh and uh it
[46:23] will be it will be interesting
[46:25] interesting to see yeah
[46:27] people it's going to come to the point
[46:29] where half of the world population have
[46:31] adopted Bitcoin that's going to be
[46:33] extremely exponential because people
[46:35] have no choice because they'll see oh my
[46:37] God my house is going down against
[46:38] Bitcoin my car is going down against
[46:39] Bitcoin every my gold is going down
[46:41] against Bitcoin I need to get into this
[46:43] before it's too late and it's going to
[46:45] be the fomo in the human nature of
[46:47] people because fomo is human nature I
[46:49] remember being a little kid and wanted
[46:51] to play outside my grandma wouldn't let
[46:52] me go for a reason for a reason or two
[46:55] and I remember watching the kids from
[46:56] the window and having that fomo so fomo
[46:59] is a is a natural human thing and I
[47:02] think that people will start to look
[47:05] into Bitcoin more and more because
[47:07] they'll have no option their family
[47:09] members are going to be talking about it
[47:10] their co-workers and it's crazy man um
[47:13] it's a heartbreaking you see new
[47:15] families that want to start their lives
[47:18] and they're paying triple of the price
[47:20] of the houses here in America for you
[47:22] know for a regular average American home
[47:24] for example in 2018 I first bought my
[47:27] house
[47:29] $98,000 it's not a big house it's about
[47:32] 1,200 sare ft my basement's finished um
[47:35] my neighbor bought for almost the same
[47:37] price and it's the same exact house
[47:38] except I have a carport so maybe has a
[47:41] little bit more value but it went from
[47:43] $98,000 my neighbor just sold his house
[47:46] for
[47:47] $260,000 so potentially I could sell it
[47:49] for 260 $280 and it's ridiculous you
[47:52] know their family their family now is
[47:54] starting a new fresh with the kids and
[47:56] they want to give them a good you know a
[47:59] good fun home safe home where they feel
[48:02] safe and play and make build Memories
[48:05] Forever and now people can't do that
[48:07] because prices are too expensive not to
[48:10] mention interest rates you know it's
[48:11] another thing about Bitcoin there's no
[48:14] there's no gimmicks or spells like that
[48:16] there's no magic tricks it's just
[48:17] Bitcoin is it just is and you follow the
[48:20] protocol it's a simple uh the white
[48:22] paper says it perfectly it's a simple
[48:25] 10-minute read you know um and there
[48:28] there's no gimmicks in Bitcoin and
[48:30] people you know when you look to the
[48:31] central banks they hike interest rate
[48:34] lower interest rate issue bonds and you
[48:37] know there's the stock market where you
[48:39] have to be an investor to save money if
[48:41] you want because you can't save cash
[48:42] because cash is devaluing exponentially
[48:44] and that's for the whole world even
[48:46] though the Brazilian Real is devaluing
[48:49] faster the Argentine payo is devaluing
[48:52] way quicker to the point of Bitcoin is
[48:53] like 36 million pesos which which is
[48:55] ridiculous reminding everyone that one
[48:59] uh in the 9s one Argentine peso was
[49:02] $1 and now it's like ridiculous hundreds
[49:05] and hundreds of of of dollars takes to
[49:07] buy I'm sorry hundreds and hundreds of
[49:09] pesos take to buy a dollar so um people
[49:12] are not going to save in cash you know
[49:14] you can't you have to save in stocks and
[49:15] it's a gimmick another gimmick of the
[49:18] society we live in that we need to have
[49:21] um a rule of sorts without a ruler you
[49:24] know rules without a ruler that's big
[49:26] coin and it provides a
[49:28] decentralized um solution for for all of
[49:31] society and people that are starting
[49:32] their lives now even rent a skyrocketed
[49:35] my friend he rented an apartment for $
[49:38] 13 $1400 and that's just a rent not he
[49:42] included not air conditioning including
[49:43] all electricity or water and so it's
[49:47] crazy because back in the day that
[49:49] apartment would be $850 900 and um so I
[49:53] think Bitcoin is especially for the
[49:55] Young adopters or I'm sorry the early
[49:57] adopters Bitcoin will be it people like
[50:01] to say oh he'll be a millionaire or
[50:03] he'll be a multi-millionaire he'll be
[50:04] rich don't value things in terms of
[50:07] dollars because the dollar is a bad rule
[50:09] or any fiat currency it's a bad ruler to
[50:12] measure things you have to measure
[50:14] things in terms of a commodity that is
[50:18] decentralized and that is um outside of
[50:20] the control of any one Tyrant so Bitcoin
[50:22] is the perfect ruler ruler to for humans
[50:25] to measure things in
[50:28] uh definitely I say that all the time
[50:29] when someone is like oh can I get a can
[50:32] I get be rich when I have Bitcoin and
[50:34] stuff like that I'm I'm like yes you
[50:35] will be a Satoshi millionaire you can be
[50:38] even if if you want to be you can even
[50:40] be a Satoshi billionaire depending on on
[50:44] on the the purchasing power you have
[50:46] right now uh and this is something
[50:48] powerful I think we have to make the
[50:50] switch to the unit of account but it's
[50:51] hard because we have those adoption
[50:54] phases of money like money is like
[50:56] collectible then store of value and
[50:58] we're now in this store of value phase
[51:00] and it will go on for a long period of
[51:02] time until we get to medium of exchange
[51:05] real adoption of medium of exchange
[51:08] where everybody is adopting Bitcoin and
[51:11] they're paying with with Bitcoin at the
[51:12] restaurants and everybody's doing that
[51:14] there there are certain uh areas of the
[51:17] world where this is already true uh but
[51:20] it's really small and Niche and and
[51:23] there's like in Italy the Bitcoin Valley
[51:25] there's in Salvador Bitcoin Beach Elon
[51:28] El Salvador in general there's Lugano in
[51:30] Swiss like there are small places where
[51:32] you can do that but it's nothing on the
[51:35] global scale it's so so tiny till now
[51:39] but back to the money printing um I
[51:41] think this is a point we have to uh
[51:44] hammer home so many times till everybody
[51:46] gets it um do you think money printing
[51:50] is
[51:51] theft yes it it absolutely is theft is
[51:54] the definition of theft or one of the
[51:56] many definitions of theft it's stealing
[51:58] from people it's a and the worst of all
[52:00] it's that it's a silent theft that
[52:02] people don't realize it you know all of
[52:04] the sudden you have $10,000 when I met
[52:07] my wife she was a um saver she is very
[52:12] frugal I got very fortunate I love my
[52:14] wife um she she's the one that made me
[52:18] an investor or or a Savor let's say um
[52:21] she's a saving cash and I One Day
[52:23] explained to her about inflation she was
[52:25] like oh my God really really I'm like
[52:27] yeah honey they print money willy-nilly
[52:29] out of thin air it's not backed by gold
[52:32] anymore it's not backed by silver it's
[52:34] not backed by anything they just print a
[52:36] paper and force you to use it you know
[52:39] so it's natural people are going to come
[52:41] into Bitcoin naturally it's not going to
[52:43] be you know underwater chess you know
[52:46] like you can see like you were saying
[52:47] it's so beautiful you see these
[52:49] communities now turning turning into
[52:51] cities adopting Bitcoin turning into
[52:53] States and within the next 50 to 100
[52:56] years maybe less it's going to be States
[52:58] turning into country as Bitcoin users
[53:01] you know you can see the the ecosystem
[53:03] in Africa it's beautiful so many uh
[53:05] peer-to-peer exchanges that you can use
[53:08] worldwide and now you can have vpns and
[53:10] say that you're in Switzerland when
[53:12] you're in when you're in Canada and you
[53:14] know websites that aren't allowed
[53:15] certain places are allowed in others you
[53:17] can use vvpn though I don't um advise
[53:20] anyone to break the law of your state
[53:21] obey the law anyways um you can see the
[53:25] growth live that's why I think it's
[53:27] going to be faster than people think
[53:29] because it's live happening life goes
[53:31] slow right life goes really slow to in
[53:34] our perspective but really everything is
[53:35] going very fast you know um I think that
[53:39] it's going to be faster than we realized
[53:42] the Bitcoin adoption and soon we're
[53:44] going to be seeing whole countries using
[53:46] it as a even as a settlement layer and
[53:48] people are going to start opting out of
[53:49] Swift because they seize Nations States
[53:53] money and they just take it and give it
[53:56] to whomever they want you know that's
[53:57] not fair it's literally not fair and so
[54:01] you know taking stealing somebody's
[54:03] things or or money or monetary value and
[54:05] giving to a whole person that doesn't
[54:07] belong to that's what Bitcoin fixes too
[54:10] like I say Bitcoin is so many things to
[54:12] so many different people it if I were to
[54:15] list them all we'd be here for you know
[54:17] 48 72 hours even more and it's so
[54:21] beautiful because it it's it's giving
[54:25] the the power back to the people and
[54:27] it's so it's so man I love it I love it
[54:30] yeah that's that's amazing um what do
[54:33] you expect from this EPO like we we
[54:36] think a lot about this EPO thinking in
[54:39] in Bitcoin when the Haring is coming and
[54:41] we recently had the Haring uh and now
[54:44] we're starting the fifth EPO of of
[54:46] Bitcoin uh basically like kind of the
[54:49] next uh uh four years or the next
[54:52] 210,000 blocks whatever time chain
[54:54] you're using uh uh what do you expect
[54:57] from uh this next fifth Epoch I think
[55:00] the last Epoch just to summarize it a
[55:02] little bit for the for the people is
[55:03] like we had the first publicly traded
[55:05] company with micro strategy coming in
[55:07] now we have like 60 or 80 or I don't
[55:10] know how many publicly traded companies
[55:12] are already in we have the Nations that
[55:14] uh that uh came in we have so many great
[55:18] things with the the ETF too ETF is also
[55:21] a big one uh like we have so many great
[55:23] things happening in one EPO how does
[55:26] this like what do you expect from the
[55:28] next EPO what's the next step to Bitcoin
[55:31] in the next like four years oh man I
[55:34] think it's beautiful which is why I'm
[55:35] telling people buy Bitcoin enter this
[55:38] Bitcoin Community because we're all
[55:40] humans we're the human Community growing
[55:42] more and more come in get off zero as
[55:46] Luke bral says just get off zero you
[55:48] know if you allocate 1% of your assets
[55:50] or investments into Bitcoin it's zero
[55:52] you got off zero and now if Bitcoin goes
[55:55] exponentially up you'll have a nice leg
[55:58] up on everybody but um what I think I
[56:01] expect for this specific ook now sorry
[56:04] about that just like the first EPO or
[56:06] I'm sorry just like the second EPO was
[56:08] better than the first the third epic
[56:10] better than the second the fourth epic
[56:13] better than the third I think this epic
[56:15] is going to be even better and that's
[56:17] what we call the bright orange future
[56:19] because it's always so beautiful and
[56:21] bright when it comes to bitcoin it's
[56:23] going to be things that surprised
[56:26] everyone you know in the last epic so
[56:29] many things that surprised people
[56:31] happened it happened it's possible with
[56:33] Bitcoin The Impossible is nothing with
[56:35] Bitcoin you know and
[56:37] so for example the ETF people don't
[56:41] understand this fact when when go gold
[56:45] ETF was approved in 2004 within the next
[56:48] decade it brought in more than N9
[56:51] trillion dollars into gold the market
[56:54] cap people don't understand this so now
[56:56] the Bitcoin ETF is approved what do
[56:59] people think it's going to happen it's
[57:00] going to happen exact that but it's
[57:02] going to be dozens of trillions 10
[57:04] hundreds of trillions going to come into
[57:06] Bitcoin and I think a lot of it is going
[57:08] to happen this epic so that's what I'm
[57:10] expecting for this epic it's going to be
[57:11] even beautiful than the first uh first
[57:14] epics amazing uh you you you were in
[57:18] Bitcoin the last EPO I think uh already
[57:21] like how did your did any way like when
[57:25] I think about like I started invest like
[57:28] getting into Bitcoin right of the start
[57:31] of the last EPO in 2020 uh and the first
[57:35] time I heard about Bitcoin it was so
[57:36] different that I thought about it than
[57:39] it is now and I'm always curious how
[57:42] people like when they along in the game
[57:44] they're thinking differently about
[57:46] Bitcoin and they evolving their uh
[57:48] thinking like can you maybe like get
[57:50] give us some some thoughts some
[57:52] imagination how you thought about first
[57:54] of Bitcoin and how this changed in the
[57:57] last like two three five whatever
[58:00] years absolutely man um you know when
[58:04] when everyone has a girlfriend or a
[58:06] boyfriend and there's that in love phase
[58:10] and everyone is you know they're
[58:11] euphoric they don't know what's going on
[58:13] around them all they can think about is
[58:15] each other that's you know the a human
[58:17] humans coming together to make little
[58:19] humans I remember um that time that in
[58:24] love time never ends with Bitcoin it it
[58:26] just draws you in deeper into the rabbit
[58:29] hole and it doesn't stop and all you can
[58:30] talk about is Bitcoin um so the the when
[58:34] I first got into Bitcoin it's around
[58:36] your time but you you adopted it faster
[58:38] than I did it's um April 2021 my friend
[58:41] my childhood friend Dogo shout out love
[58:43] you man my childhood friend Dogo came
[58:46] over with Stefan and his brother my
[58:49] childhood friends too and doo was like
[58:51] hey let's let's start investing because
[58:54] he has he's always been a very
[58:56] responsible guy for he was working when
[58:58] since he was 15 and I think like me he
[59:00] never really saved I don't know but he
[59:02] said you know what let's start now
[59:04] because in 30 years we can be
[59:05] millionaires and enjoy ourselves in the
[59:07] boat retire early etc etc so we made
[59:09] that packed in April 2021 and I remember
[59:13] being in Robin Hood and I remember
[59:16] finding this thing called Bitcoin and it
[59:18] had done
[59:19] this it had gone from $10,000 to
[59:23] $69,000 I'm like oh what is this you
[59:25] know a little bit and I remember it
[59:28] dipped to 64,000 and everyone says buy
[59:31] the dip buy the dip buy the dip and so I
[59:33] did I started buying increments of $100
[59:36] and I've posted it to Twitter X and I
[59:39] remember reading about what it was
[59:40] because many investors tell you never
[59:42] invest in something that you don't know
[59:44] so I started looking into Bitcoin and I
[59:46] I really love podcast and I really love
[59:47] audiobooks I listen to books all the
[59:50] time and so I remember studying Bitcoin
[59:53] and then I started to find sailor bre
[59:56] read law s sailor had already adopted
[59:58] the Bitcoin strategy for micro strategy
[60:01] um for those who don't know micro
[60:03] strategy was like um it is a software
[60:05] company a thriving a very good one it
[60:07] used to compete with Microsoft Microsoft
[60:10] then grew out grew everything else in
[60:12] the stock market but that's that's what
[60:13] micro strategy is it's a software
[60:15] engineering company and I remember
[60:18] listening to sailor and then I found
[60:19] breed love and then I listen to his
[60:21] podcast and then when you realize when
[60:24] like you said the Sailor series on the
[60:26] what is money show from bread love breed
[60:28] love is very important to listen to
[60:31] because it tells you exactly what
[60:32] Bitcoin is in about N9 10 maybe 12
[60:37] episodes but I remember falling in love
[60:40] with Bitcoin and that never ended by the
[60:43] way but so what I thought about Bitcoin
[60:46] then was something that was going to
[60:48] make me Rich you know ngu number go up
[60:51] and it kind of did you it kind of did
[60:55] but that's not why I'm in it anymore I
[60:57] mean it's such a tiny reason why I'm in
[61:00] it it's to give a better future for my
[61:03] children as you go along you know the
[61:05] way I think about now as opposed to back
[61:07] then is that I don't care anymore about
[61:10] the ngu even though it's nice and we
[61:12] make fun of it that's why when Bitcoin
[61:13] dips I don't care it just dipped from
[61:16] what 73,000 to 62 you know I'm like oh
[61:19] man nice I can buy more Bitcoin sweet
[61:21] you know and Friday comes and I buy some
[61:24] more but the way I think of it it now
[61:26] compared to the beginning is that
[61:29] Bitcoin is here to fix the problems of
[61:32] humanity that's what Bitcoin is here for
[61:34] it is to take away the power from
[61:37] tyrants Killers because that's what they
[61:40] are because they start wars all the time
[61:43] it's to take away power from their hands
[61:45] to destroy obliterate the bangster
[61:47] cartel because they're basically cartels
[61:50] and there's the bigger cartels and the
[61:51] smaller cartels one of the cartels just
[61:53] failed allegedly you know the I guess
[61:55] this best weekend another bank failed
[61:58] and got bought out by JP Morgan or
[62:01] something um don't quote me in that
[62:03] probably JP Morgan but um it's it's
[62:07] obliterating the the mafias you know
[62:10] it's it's taking power away from the
[62:13] tyrants and giv it back to whom it
[62:15] belongs that's the whole point of the
[62:17] Constitution you know a government by
[62:20] the people for the people of the people
[62:22] you know and that's what the Declaration
[62:23] of Independence was and Bitcoin is for
[62:28] Humanity it's it's a declaration of
[62:30] independence for Humanity without
[62:33] violence without blood you know I'm care
[62:37] being careful with my words because you
[62:38] know YouTube sometimes gets picky about
[62:40] that but um so yeah Bitcoin is pure
[62:43] peace it's it's packed peace and it's a
[62:46] way to channel energy at the speed of
[62:48] light across the globe anytime you want
[62:51] without
[62:52] middlemen 100% it's it's it's so
[62:55] beautiful and so cool to to listen to
[62:57] and how you describe it uh it's
[62:59] fascinating to to see like you you can
[63:02] basically pick on Twitter any real
[63:05] bitcoiner put in on podcast and he will
[63:07] be great to listen to
[63:09] like that's that's basically my idea of
[63:12] the podcast and uh it's I think we
[63:15] discovered so many great people already
[63:18] and thank you also for for being on I
[63:20] just wanted to say it because you really
[63:21] describe it really really cool and
[63:23] before we get to our end routine um
[63:27] where do you think Bitcoin will be in
[63:29] the end of the cycle and you don't have
[63:31] to have a price prediction uh because I
[63:33] don't think it's it's it's good to think
[63:35] in dollar terms if you have it's also
[63:38] good uh but is it like uh you have like
[63:41] oh for one Bitcoin you will have like
[63:43] certain amount of houses you can buy
[63:45] like we we like the the purchasing power
[63:49] of Bitcoin is kind of a an Health
[63:52] indicator at some like a indicator how
[63:56] many people already understand it and if
[63:59] you have more adoption and the ETF is
[64:01] coming do you have any model in your
[64:03] head where Bitcoin could be uh in the
[64:06] end of this cycle obviously there's like
[64:08] this Haring thing where the first Haring
[64:11] it was
[64:12] like only one number then two and three
[64:15] and now we like five and we probably
[64:18] will be at six when we measured in US
[64:20] Dollars do we have something like that
[64:23] yeah it's amazing that Bitcoin works
[64:24] like clockwork it's perfect it's it
[64:26] doesn't skip a beat every 10 minutes a
[64:29] new block is found um every 10 minutes
[64:31] it just keeps um auditing Itself by
[64:35] hundreds of thousands of people
[64:36] worldwide um so like clockwork the
[64:41] Bitcoin price the health indicator has
[64:44] um shown to go up exponentially after
[64:47] every having now the difference for
[64:49] those who don't know for this new having
[64:51] the number did a new all-time high
[64:53] before the having which makes me think
[64:55] that it it there's a chart I posted on
[64:58] Twitter x uh of four of four epics and
[65:02] showing exactly after the the block
[65:05] having reward or the yeah it went up
[65:08] exponentially like double triple the
[65:11] price and so this is going to happen in
[65:13] the greater scale in my opinion um it's
[65:16] usually happens uh months after like
[65:19] five 6 seven eight nine months after the
[65:22] having and it just grows exponentially I
[65:24] think this epic is not any different
[65:27] that's what's going to happen um I think
[65:30] potentially you know it could be um we
[65:33] were at
[65:34] 73 last month and I think Bitcoin could
[65:38] well well go it's gonna it's going to
[65:40] Skyrocket past 120 it's going to just
[65:43] keep going I don't know where it's going
[65:44] to stop and then come down a little bit
[65:46] again but I would be willing to say a
[65:49] $200,000 Bitcoin that's what's it's
[65:51] going to be and it's going to drive more
[65:52] people to buy Bitcoin because of fomo
[65:54] people are they see it in the news
[65:56] everywhere in every program every
[65:58] entertainment every Instagram or every
[66:01] YouTube influencer talking about this
[66:03] thing Bitcoin like uh like that dude
[66:06] that lost a Bitcoin or he he sold it
[66:09] when it went down and then he freaked
[66:11] out and he's angry now but it's going to
[66:13] be everyone that's going to be every
[66:15] influencer and they're going to be
[66:17] talking about it nonstop and that's what
[66:19] brings people to people are just going
[66:21] to fomo into Bitcoin here in America I
[66:23] don't know in Europe but here you can
[66:25] buy Bitcoin anywhere man you can buy it
[66:27] in VMO have you ever heard of VMO uh
[66:30] yeah it's I heard about it because I'm
[66:31] on Twitter but uh in Europe Europe I
[66:34] never heard it you probably have a
[66:36] different one my my family in Brazil has
[66:38] something called pix and you know we
[66:40] have venmo PayPal they already allow you
[66:42] to buy it for over a year now uh there's
[66:45] so many different options here every
[66:48] stock trading platform like Robin Hood
[66:51] Mumu Weeble you can buy Bitcoin so it's
[66:53] going to be very easy for people to just
[66:55] go in their phone again the magic little
[66:57] box they're going to go there and
[66:59] they're going to get you know what I'm
[67:00] just going to get some just in case
[67:02] that's what they think and then Bitcoin
[67:03] there's another exponential like oh my
[67:05] God you know um and then it goes down
[67:07] and people sell you know so the main
[67:09] thing with Bitcoin is if you're not
[67:12] looking to hold it for at least four
[67:14] years don't buy any don't get any if
[67:17] you're going to be trading that's not a
[67:18] good idea people get wrecked more than
[67:20] anything in Bitcoin because it's very
[67:22] volatile and just like life life is
[67:24] volatile my my heart's beating right now
[67:27] it could stop and I could die my heart's
[67:29] fall out everyone every single aspect of
[67:32] the universe that of the earth that has
[67:35] life is volatile you know a wind can
[67:37] blow a tree down the tree dies you know
[67:40] uh the the the the bird gets the fish
[67:44] from the water the fish is everything is
[67:45] volatile things that are
[67:47] living is volatile so Bitcoin is the
[67:50] same way it's it's going to be the next
[67:52] the next step in the evolution of human
[67:55] civil ation it's Ain it's if you want to
[67:58] compare it to Innovations it's thein to
[68:00] fire to big things like the wheel it's
[68:02] akin to electricity being discovered
[68:05] invented it's akin to Motor Vehicles
[68:07] it's akin to flight that interconnected
[68:10] the whole world so that's what Bitcoin
[68:12] is and um I think many people are going
[68:15] to start to understand that especially
[68:16] thanks to you people like you that you
[68:19] know you go on YouTube and you put your
[68:21] your content out there and that's
[68:23] getting referred to many different
[68:24] YouTube people and so they're like oh
[68:26] let me see what this is you know and
[68:27] they start listening they they learn
[68:29] about Bitcoin you know there's so many
[68:31] Bitcoin podcasts out there and I love it
[68:33] the more Bitcoin podcasts the better it
[68:35] is so people can hear the the truth and
[68:39] reality of money that money shouldn't be
[68:42] printed out of thin air it's thanks to
[68:44] you people you guys the podcasters that
[68:46] are spreading this message because
[68:48] podcasting is the future you can see
[68:50] here The Spectators or audience of the
[68:53] corporate media going went down and down
[68:56] and down and down and you can see
[68:57] podcasting going boom like I I used to
[69:00] listen to Joe Rogan podcast when it was
[69:02] like 2013 2014 his daughters were tiny
[69:05] they were running around the the bed the
[69:08] the living room and he had about like 10
[69:10] or 12 Spectators I was one of those and
[69:14] I remember just watching one day and
[69:15] hearing that he had 10 million downloads
[69:17] every single episode it's up to like 15
[69:19] million or something which is crazy Joey
[69:21] Rogan is just a small example or a big
[69:23] example of people or podcasts becoming
[69:27] more popular with people so that go back
[69:30] to I'm going back to the thing I told
[69:31] you earlier your podcast eventually is
[69:33] going to blow up just like every single
[69:36] Bitcoin podcast out there because people
[69:38] are going to be thirsty for for Truth uh
[69:41] I I definitely hope
[69:43] that I I can see that uh and it's
[69:46] already like growing really really
[69:48] quickly I started it basically this year
[69:50] in the starting uh I mean December was
[69:52] the official start but uh I didn't start
[69:56] growing till January in the middle uh
[69:59] and I had 200 followers back then now I
[70:02] had
[70:03] 3,200 time of recording do you think
[70:06] that coincides with the Bitcoin price
[70:08] because I feel like a lot of Bitcoin
[70:10] podcasts grow when bitcoin price grow so
[70:12] foro brings in people I have no clue
[70:15] because I just started right now uh I
[70:19] started Twitter when it was like end of
[70:23] 2022 which was really really good time
[70:25] of starting because it was like at the
[70:28] bare Market uh and since then since it
[70:32] started hosting and speaking publicly
[70:34] about Bitcoin Bitcoin was basically just
[70:37] going up of course there were like down
[70:38] terms crashes uh and I don't see any
[70:42] patterns with the price and my videos I
[70:45] see more patterns when I do a better job
[70:47] in the thumbnail in the title yeah
[70:49] course there are a lot of bitcoiners out
[70:53] there uh a lot more than fre th000
[70:55] bitcoiners out there that are thirsty
[70:57] for Bitcoin content even if the price is
[70:59] down 20% like even if the price is not
[71:03] crashing sometimes maybe it increases
[71:06] even the the viewership because people
[71:08] want to know oh it's Bitcoin still a
[71:11] thing is Bitcoin actually good maybe uh
[71:13] a crash down 20% uh is is good I think
[71:17] for for people uh like in the podcast
[71:20] and entertainment and Creator and
[71:22] education scene there's like you always
[71:25] have the the stand up people that just
[71:27] want to get educated want to listen to
[71:29] the show but you on top of that you have
[71:32] when the price swings a lot and it I
[71:35] think it doesn't even matter if it goes
[71:37] up or down but it just has to swing so
[71:39] it's in the news then new people come in
[71:42] because then they like oh Bitcoin is
[71:43] crashing let's check out Bitcoin let's
[71:45] Google Bitcoin on on on YouTube and
[71:48] stuff like that so I think uh as we say
[71:51] the price brings people in the price
[71:53] brings also people of course in the part
[71:55] and I I I I play a long game I started a
[72:00] podcast now and I will do it till I die
[72:04] this is this is a promise I can give
[72:06] everyone I don't know that's why you're
[72:08] gonna succeed that's why because you're
[72:09] going to be consistent yes 100% I don't
[72:12] know if I can do it seven times a week
[72:15] my whole life uh but I will do it every
[72:19] week and I will do every week uh podcast
[72:22] episodes I hope I can do it every day I
[72:24] hope I can get to this level where uh I
[72:27] can just do it every day record once
[72:30] maybe I have a production team that
[72:32] takes care of of the editing and the
[72:34] post production so I can focus on on new
[72:36] businesses and books and whatever I want
[72:38] to do in my life I'm still 25 like I my
[72:41] life is in front of me not behind me so
[72:44] I don't know what my life brings but my
[72:46] plan is to do it just the whole life I
[72:50] want to document my life and my thinking
[72:53] and my friends uh and and my environment
[72:57] with this podcast and right now I'm just
[72:59] starting with Bitcoin uh and I think
[73:02] Bitcoin will be this this podcast will
[73:05] probably be a Bitcoin Focus podcast for
[73:07] the next 10 years at some point Bitcoin
[73:10] will be boring it's like talking about
[73:12] email it's like talking
[73:14] about like the dcpip protocol every day
[73:18] nobody wants to hear it uh so at some
[73:20] point Bitcoin will be so boring that I
[73:22] don't want to talk about it and nobody
[73:24] wants to listen listen to it because
[73:26] everybody will have adopted it
[73:28] absolutely you're right and And when
[73:30] everybody adopts it and everybody uses
[73:32] it why should we talk
[73:34] about uh so there will come this point
[73:37] where I probably go maybe with freedom
[73:39] maybe something I don't know I have no
[73:41] what I will talk about that but I'm
[73:44] pretty sure the next 10 years this
[73:47] podcast will have the widest range of of
[73:51] Bitcoin guests on and it will be a
[73:53] Bitcoin Focus podcast and we talked also
[73:55] a lot about non-bitcoin stuff today but
[73:58] the theme is always Bitcoin and from
[74:01] there we get into Freedom politics uh
[74:04] geographically Game Theory like so many
[74:06] different uh uh so many different
[74:08] Avenues you can go through and it's
[74:10] fascinating for me to see and it's I'm
[74:12] feeling really humble and grateful that
[74:15] I am in the position that I can do it
[74:17] full-time I can I can speak fulltime on
[74:20] bitcoin and getting paid for that this
[74:22] is this is amazing for me and also thank
[74:25] like I got today some super chats
[74:28] because the the video of Gary Kone does
[74:32] great and I just want to take the
[74:34] opportunity now to say thank you to
[74:36] everyone that ever gave me any Satoshi
[74:38] any Euros with with the YouTube super
[74:41] thanks I hope YouTube in in the future
[74:44] allows Sates also to to give directly to
[74:47] to greaters but I think this will be
[74:49] further down the line because they also
[74:51] take a hefty cut but uh I'm thanking
[74:54] everyone that gives me anything uh for
[74:56] that because I'm still cannot fat I'm
[74:59] like it's like sometimes I'm like I'm
[75:01] just streaming I don't know what I'm
[75:02] doing here and you you know what too
[75:05] people need to understand I'm sure most
[75:07] people understand but when you donate or
[75:09] do a super chat to a podcast you love
[75:12] you're supporting them making sure
[75:14] they're in business you know if it
[75:15] wasn't the bakery wouldn't be in
[75:17] business if they didn't sell the bread
[75:18] or the pastries So you you're basically
[75:22] giving your energy to keep that business
[75:25] live or a podcast or whatever you you
[75:27] like you have to make sure you donate so
[75:30] you make sure that the the podcast can
[75:33] go on it's very very important it might
[75:34] be like not 10 not five maybe a dollar
[75:37] you know that's all you can donate that
[75:39] dollar you multiply that by many people
[75:42] and you're helping the podcast grow and
[75:44] get stronger and pushing the Bitcoin

[76:34] have said something I didn't know that's
[76:36] a learning moment so I always make sure
[76:38] folks that you support your the podcast
[76:40] that you love yeah and there will be
[76:43] like obviously I the when someone gives
[76:46] me just straight up money because they
[76:49] listen uh listen to it and they don't
[76:51] get anything in in return because they
[76:53] like received value from the and they
[76:55] want to give value back this is
[76:56] something huge like even if someone
[76:58] gives me two it's like wow that's like
[77:01] huge to me obviously I have sponsors uh
[77:04] so people also can like just use my
[77:06] codes uh indirectly also gets me money
[77:10] and and and things like that I will open
[77:12] a lot of uh indirect stuff also I want
[77:15] to make um Bitcoin clothing I want to
[77:18] have something with Bitcoin messages and
[77:20] freedom messages also writing a book
[77:22] like I'm I will open a lot of possib
[77:24] ities to to support that but in general
[77:27] I just want to push the Bitcoin
[77:29] narrative I want to just push the the
[77:31] Bitcoin education the next 10 years uh
[77:34] and the great thing is like if I if some
[77:37] viewers getting value and they give me
[77:39] value back in whatever way I can use
[77:42] those that energy to reinvest in Bitcoin
[77:46] I can uh have this podcast edit perhaps
[77:49] hire someone that gives me a more
[77:52] professional editing and stuff like that
[77:54] and and stuff like that so it reaches
[77:56] more people I can maybe reinvest my time
[77:59] in newsletters and can reinvest my time
[78:00] in other stuff so we can get bigger and
[78:03] I think it's uh it's important to
[78:06] support your cause and it's it's it does
[78:10] not has to be me like if you don't watch
[78:12] like if this the first podcast and you
[78:13] watch uh some other podcaster every day
[78:17] go ahead and support them like they are
[78:19] also doing the same job go ahead and
[78:20] support your favorite people uh that
[78:24] give value that educate people because
[78:27] they need to uh live on that at someh
[78:30] obviously like don't don't uh like you
[78:33] don't have to uh um sponsor Michael saor
[78:37] or something they they fig like you
[78:40] don't have like if you want to do that
[78:41] fine but like like even find small
[78:44] graders like find people that you like
[78:47] or even like that's what what I like
[78:49] about the idea of Nostra or like found
[78:52] the podcast there because you're just
[78:53] like oh this was really I want to
[78:55] sponsor them I want to give I love F
[78:58] Fountain is my favorite I can just zap
[79:00] people you know whatever value I I earn
[79:03] there for for those who don't know
[79:05] Fountain streams a little amount of
[79:07] Satoshi into your wallet and you can do
[79:09] whatever you want with it you can either
[79:11] withdraw or you can provide value to
[79:13] other podcasters and that's helping them
[79:16] absolutely and the beauty of Bitcoin is
[79:17] that Bitcoin pushes itself it's amazing
[79:21] how we Bitcoin sometimes I jokingly say
[79:24] tongue and cheek that I feel like
[79:26] Bitcoin is a living organism because it
[79:30] it has an immune system Bitcoin loves it
[79:32] when you attack it because it it not
[79:34] only adapts but it thrives from that
[79:36] information of the attack whatever
[79:38] attack it was like the China ban China B
[79:41] Bitcoin like four or five times and they
[79:43] still have a huge amount of the hash
[79:45] rate people are still using Bitcoin You
[79:47] Can't Ban code code is speech you can't
[79:50] bend speech people are going to find a
[79:51] way to express themselves so that's the
[79:54] beauty of Bitcoin it pushes itself and
[79:56] you can be a vessel for it and it's
[79:58] really beautiful because you do the main
[80:00] thing that different podcasters do is
[80:03] they they send it to different to
[80:07] different people with different walks of
[80:09] life and that's and podcasting is the
[80:11] future everybody listens to
[80:13] podcasts and I even encourage people uh
[80:17] if if they have a message and they want
[80:19] to spread it and they want to be
[80:21] outspoken about Bitcoin first of all
[80:23] just message me and I will love to have
[80:26] more and more bitcoiners on uh I can
[80:29] give you the the platform uh if you're
[80:32] through bitcoiners like I never like I I
[80:37] only reject people that are about crypto
[80:40] and some scams like I have people reach
[80:43] out I want to fill the that up but if
[80:46] you're a genuine bitcoiner uh I I 100%
[80:51] want you on my podcast and and and give
[80:53] you the platform to maybe start your own
[80:55] YouTube channel maybe start something
[80:56] else I had Julian uh boring on on my
[81:01] show he apparently also actually is
[81:03] called boring in his last name I know
[81:05] yeah it's a common last name in America
[81:08] yeah and and uh he uh was saying that he
[81:11] wants to be the voice of Bitcoin he
[81:12] wants to like uh um speak the audiobook
[81:15] because he is such an unique voice and
[81:18] and I loved it and he got after my
[81:21] podcast certain re outreaches from other
[81:24] people are like hey can you do this AUD
[81:26] book hey can you do this and this is
[81:28] something amazing this is what I want to
[81:29] do I want to lift up bitcoiners that a
[81:32] real bitcoiners because I feel I see too
[81:35] many [ __ ] coiners out there yeah man
[81:38] it's it like you said it's a it's kind
[81:39] of like a rising tide raises All Ships
[81:42] and that's what Bitcoin is doing and
[81:44] people say people say oh my God
[81:46] bitcoiners are so hateful they're toxic
[81:48] maximalist it's not that it's that
[81:52] cryptocurrencies and this is not
[81:54] according to me it's according to the to
[81:56] the to you know Securities Exchange
[81:59] Commission and to many other people who
[82:00] lost a ton of money
[82:02] cryptocurrencies are a vast majority are
[82:06] Ponzi schemes getrich quick um scams and
[82:09] unregistered Securities you know we're
[82:12] not technically against cryptocurrency
[82:14] it's because they're mostly scams and
[82:16] the only real asset that had Immaculate
[82:20] Conception is Bitcoin Immaculate
[82:22] Conception because nobody knows who
[82:23] Satoshi is or was nobody knows you know
[82:27] Satoshi released um released the white
[82:30] paper for many Cipher punks and then be
[82:32] and then he released the programming and
[82:34] people downloaded the program and
[82:35] started running it Satoshi wasn't
[82:37] allegedly Satoshi wasn't even the the
[82:40] first one to run Bitcoin he released it
[82:42] and then somebody started mining Bitcoin
[82:45] and then he went in and then that's when
[82:46] Halen tweeted posted running Bitcoin the
[82:50] iconic tweet that he did and I repost it
[82:53] all the time but
[82:55] if you're a Bitcoin or to please make
[82:56] sure to run your note it's very
[82:58] important you're you're basically
[83:00] auditing the Bitcoin Network every 10
[83:02] minutes 247 so run note is very
[83:05] important too amazing and uh we are
[83:08] already like past the time
[83:11] we it was fun it's super fun man yeah
[83:15] and let's come to the endro it was super
[83:18] fun and and I agree with that I I I
[83:20] would love to go like two hours more
[83:22] maybe I'm I'm converting
[83:25] wrong type of podcast where I'm going
[83:26] for four five hours I don't know and
[83:29] people listen to it believe it or not
[83:30] they listen to it they're construction
[83:32] workers their fishermen their ambulance
[83:35] drivers they listen to the podcast you
[83:37] know yeah and it's it's it's great I I
[83:40] love it and I think yeah maybe I will uh
[83:43] maybe do just like three four a week and
[83:45] just like do five hour blocks with
[83:48] people let's let's let's see how how it
[83:50] goes you know the podcast it would be
[83:52] really cool to go like a 5 hour block
[83:54] was shout out to Le Lisa Hughes her
[83:58] podcast with you was amazing I remember
[84:00] being amazed she was talking about
[84:02] untapped sources of energy that gets
[84:04] wasted that Bitcoin can mine and instead
[84:07] of wasting that energy whatever it is
[84:09] oil Natural Gas Propane anything you
[84:12] instead of wasting it or flouring up in
[84:13] the air completely destroying and
[84:16] wasting it you can use Bitcoin you can
[84:18] mine Bitcoin with it and then you can
[84:20] channel the Bitcoin energy throughout
[84:22] the world to exchange goods and services
[84:25] amazing I led it too and uh we said that
[84:27] we will 100% make a part two uh there
[84:30] are so many great topics uh she can uh
[84:33] talk about also like I think the topic
[84:36] that she would be also great to talk
[84:38] about is Raising uh uncon raising
[84:42] unconforming kids in a conforming world
[84:45] this is the thing that she I think
[84:47] talked about in bit but bit bit block
[84:50] boom uh and I think this would be also a
[84:52] great podcast with her so like uh yeah I
[84:55] will this also the next thing I already
[84:57] have 106 guests on with you now when
[85:01] will I do a second
[85:04] round because that' be nice yeah there
[85:06] are great people that I just like had
[85:08] one podcast and there's like 20
[85:11] different topics I want to talk with
[85:12] them so uh like this I appreciate that
[85:15] and uh it will be interesting so to see
[85:17] there many different directions uh we
[85:19] can go from from here but let's let's
[85:21] come to the end routine uh let's let's
[85:23] close this this one down and let's have
[85:25] a second round second round with you at
[85:28] some point I'm really looking forward to
[85:29] that if you don't mind before you close
[85:32] I just you mentioned kids and that just
[85:33] reminded me I'm so sorry I'll go fast be
[85:35] respectful of your time it's um the for
[85:38] those who doubt that Bitcoin is going to
[85:40] take swallow the entire world whole
[85:43] remember children are born raised
[85:47] educated and live online so even in
[85:50] schools now public schools All Over
[85:52] America they use tablets un University
[85:54] have they have always been using laptops
[85:56] to whether take notes and and learn and
[85:59] whatever children are the future like
[86:01] you were saying Lisa Hughes to learn to
[86:05] raise children who think for themselves
[86:07] that's what I'm trying to do with my
[86:08] children but also when you instill that
[86:11] hope in the future generation they're
[86:13] going to grow up with that hope and
[86:14] spread throughout the Earth and the
[86:16] Earth is going to be a better place so
[86:18] remember children are born educated
[86:21] raised online that's that's where they
[86:23] are everything's
