[00:00] had it not been for belli I don't know
[00:02] if I would have came back so that's what
[00:04] made me move now what made me stay was
[00:07] definitely the Bitcoin aspect where are
[00:08] you from what are you doing here and if
[00:10] you just tell them I I I I want
[00:12] experience with it's like they're going
[00:13] to show you they're going to invite you
[00:14] into their phone they're going to invite
[00:16] you into their favorite place you can
[00:17] get by just a single person with $1,000
[00:19] a month and live a very comfortable life
[00:21] live close to Beach have your basic
[00:23] necessities cover have great food that's
[00:25] the one thing the food here is fantastic
[00:28] how important do you think is Salvador
[00:30] in This Global Bitcoin narrative getting
[00:32] into El Salvador now is
[00:34] like are you actually originally from El
[00:37] Salvador or did you my family is
[00:39] originally from Al Salvador yeah they
[00:41] like very typical story they left during
[00:44] the Civil War which is a very dark time
[00:47] in sa history and they relocated to
[00:50] Canada which is where I was born and so
[00:52] I was born in Toronto Canada spent all
[00:55] of my young life with there started
[00:58] coming back to salad I you know my
[01:00] parents would bring me when I was a
[01:01] young child um then I there was about a
[01:03] 15-year Gap I want to say where I didn't
[01:07] visit in Sun you know there was a lot a
[01:10] lot of things going on in the country
[01:12] turmoil conflict gangs a whole bunch of
[01:14] stuff going on so I didn't really feel
[01:16] the need to to come back it it did call
[01:20] me and then as I got older um and I had
[01:23] traveled a little bit more I started to
[01:25] see a lot of similarities between the
[01:28] countries that I visited
[01:30] and you know being from Toronto there
[01:33] aren't that many big cities like that in
[01:36] the world you know Toronto is one of a
[01:38] few when you really think of the the
[01:41] architecture and and you know just the
[01:43] first world quote unquote and then you
[01:46] start to realize that really the rest of
[01:48] the world is not like that at all and
[01:51] the rest of the world has more
[01:52] similarities to each other than uh than
[01:55] Toronto does so when I would travel I
[01:58] started seeing a lot of you know those
[02:01] things that I missed about in Salvador
[02:03] so when I got older I decided I was
[02:04] going to start traveling to in Salvador
[02:06] a little bit more often and that's what
[02:09] brought me here and that's what brought
[02:11] me here to it Sund that's what brought
[02:12] me down to bitcoin Beach I really wanted
[02:14] to get back in touch with my roots
[02:17] really wanted to you know reach back and
[02:19] spend more time with the family that I
[02:21] had down here in nalone and connect a
[02:24] little bit more with you know with where
[02:26] my family came from it was something
[02:27] that I was missing and something that I
[02:28] was definitely curious
[02:31] would you have would do you think you
[02:33] would have moved back anyways even if na
[02:37] PUK and Bitcoin and all this stuff going
[02:39] on in El Salvador over the last three
[02:41] years was not there did when did you
[02:43] move back I don't know that's a funny
[02:45] that's an interesting question and and
[02:47] the way that you you've asked it is what
[02:49] makes it so interesting because had it
[02:51] not been for buelli I don't know if I
[02:54] would have came back you know I wasn't a
[02:57] bitcoiner to be fair you know part of my
[02:59] story was I I I from Toronto I have a
[03:02] financial background went to school for
[03:04] business and commerce and so very Fiat
[03:07] minded when you think of of big city um
[03:10] so I was into Financial tools and
[03:14] investment tools and things like that
[03:16] money markets and all that know the fun
[03:18] stuff bonds
[03:20] whatever but it was really during covid
[03:23] when all of that stuff happened that I
[03:26] was looking and comparing everything
[03:28] that the government in Canada was doing
[03:30] versus governments across the world plus
[03:33] me being from in noticing what Kelly was
[03:36] doing at the time in 2020 you know he
[03:38] had just won presidency um so he was
[03:41] maybe a year into the position and not
[03:44] many people were paying attention to
[03:45] what El saer was doing because it's a
[03:47] small country you know people most
[03:49] people can't even point out where El
[03:50] saer is on a map H but I'm paying
[03:53] attention to it because my family's from
[03:55] there my family would always watch the
[03:57] Salvadorian news on TV and so I was
[04:00] comparing everything that was happening
[04:02] during Co directly with the Canadian
[04:04] government and the Salvadoran government
[04:06] and you know four or five months after
[04:09] Co let's call it June
[04:12] 2020 I um I really started leaning more
[04:17] towards well I I I liked what Buell did
[04:21] in El Salvador um I think it was a fair
[04:24] and just system at least more fair when
[04:26] and I'm comparing the two governments
[04:28] this whole time and so that's at that
[04:30] point I had pretty much said to myself
[04:32] well this was a big test of where I want
[04:35] to spend some more time with more time
[04:38] in and so I made the move to come to a
[04:41] before I even knew about Bitcoin I
[04:43] didn't know there was I knew about
[04:44] Bitcoin but I didn't know there was the
[04:46] Bitcoin Beach project happening down
[04:47] here which started back in 2019 I didn't
[04:50] know I didn't know what Bitcoin later 2
[04:52] or lightning was I was just curious
[04:55] about El Salvador curious about getting
[04:57] touched back on my roots and I really
[04:59] really liked um when I compared what the
[05:02] governments were doing I enjoyed the
[05:04] approach that Kelly took to co and to
[05:07] the full pandemic um situation so that's
[05:10] what made me move now what made me stay
[05:15] I would say was definitely the the
[05:16] Bitcoin aspect of it uh the plan was to
[05:19] go to explore you know the country and
[05:23] maybe explore the rest of Central
[05:25] America kind of see where I could fit in
[05:28] and then you know as I'm here while I'm
[05:30] down here Kelly makes that big
[05:32] announcement at Bitcoin 2021 I think it
[05:36] was
[05:37] right Bitcoin conference 2021 and so I
[05:40] hear it and I'm like wow this is great
[05:43] um this is interesting to me you know I
[05:45] didn't really know what Bitcoin was at
[05:47] the time I hadn't really you know dive
[05:49] didn't take that dive that deep dive
[05:51] into the rabbit hole U but I'm like okay
[05:54] this is cool no one else has done this
[05:56] and then I'm starting to meet all these
[05:58] great mind all these intellectual people
[06:01] all these all these people with a
[06:02] mission and I'm starting to meet them
[06:03] here in and that's what really made me
[06:06] fall in love with the place that's Will
[06:07] May me stay you know meeting people and
[06:10] you've had them on your podcast Micki
[06:12] and James just that type of community
[06:15] honestly that's what made me stay I tell
[06:18] that to people all the time Bitcoin
[06:19] didn't bring me to El Salvador but the
[06:21] community and the bitcoiners that I've
[06:23] been able to meet here the opportunities
[06:25] the conversations that's why I'm here
[06:29] and that's was so
[06:33] special that's amazing and what did you
[06:35] then decide to do with uh Bitcoin like
[06:39] uh what did brought you into Bitcoin was
[06:41] it like the the wipe going on because
[06:43] you were inide because you heard about
[06:46] Bitcoin more and more so basically was
[06:48] it like the environment pushed you a
[06:50] little bit towards Bitcoin yeah
[06:52] definitely the environment projects the
[06:55] conversations I was having with people
[06:57] the proof work and you know that's let's
[07:00] not beat around the bush it was people
[07:02] were looking to solve real world issues
[07:04] not just make quick fck everywhere else
[07:07] I'd been to the rest of the world it was
[07:09] all about you know how can I make that
[07:11] Qui dollar whereas below it was well how
[07:14] can we fix these issues that we're
[07:16] currently having and so it was that it
[07:19] was that environment it was that just
[07:22] that battle know that willingness to to
[07:24] figure Solutions find solutions for
[07:26] these problems that's really drove me uh
[07:29] to to stick around and and to start my
[07:31] own project working with a couple of the
[07:33] projects here and discovering what they
[07:35] were doing I realized well this is a lot
[07:37] bigger than what I thought it was and I
[07:39] want a deep dive and I want to learn
[07:41] more about Bitcoin and I need to take I
[07:43] need to take this opportunity to learn
[07:45] from you know the best I want to say
[07:48] because the people here are doing
[07:49] fantastic job yeah it's amazing like you
[07:53] uh I search a little bit what you're
[07:54] doing and you're obviously that Bitcoin
[07:56] hardware store where you are actually
[07:58] right now sitting uh but you're also
[07:59] doing other stuff what what made you uh
[08:02] open this Bitcoin hardware store did you
[08:03] saw like a demand for uh Hardware
[08:06] wallets
[08:07] toall it it was my own it was my own um
[08:11] my own experience of learning about
[08:15] Bitcoin here in Bitcoin country and you
[08:18] know going through the my meid Bitcoin
[08:20] program understanding the importance of
[08:22] self- custody and then realizing oh it's
[08:26] not that easy to self custody you know
[08:28] you have to find a hardw wallet you have
[08:30] to order it you has to come through the
[08:32] border
[08:33] of um things are a little bit more
[08:35] expensive here technology wise for all
[08:37] the fees and I consider myself a you
[08:41] know a pretty good learner pretty
[08:43] resourceful I love going on YouTube and
[08:45] just searching things up you know I
[08:48] don't need anybody if I'm interested in
[08:50] a subject I'm GNA go and take that deep
[08:52] dive H and it was difficult for me even
[08:56] right starting up my own node doing a
[08:58] whole bunch of things so that's what
[09:00] made me realize well if I'm having this
[09:02] problem if this is an opportunity or an
[09:05] experience or a challenge that I'm
[09:06] having that it must be there must be
[09:08] other people and ultimately what I'm
[09:11] looking for is to help the Salvadoran
[09:14] help that person that when I look at a
[09:16] Salvador you know I see my grandmother I
[09:18] see my father I see my sister and this
[09:21] is where it's all starting now education
[09:24] is the key to everything and and I say
[09:26] this and I I you might have heard this
[09:28] in other places but the work that me
[09:31] Bitcoin is doing that you know the the
[09:33] Ministry of Education is doing focusing
[09:35] really on on education of Bitcoin is so
[09:38] important because without that education
[09:41] that's where you know people can get
[09:42] scammed people can get lied to miss
[09:45] information so that's the important
[09:47] aspect about all of this and that's
[09:49] really what drove me to start the
[09:50] project is we need to have we need to
[09:53] make people feel comfortable and the
[09:55] best way to make them feel comfortable
[09:57] is by actually having a physical place
[09:59] creating that reputation because when
[10:02] everything's online it almost doesn't
[10:03] feel it feels like something's missing
[10:05] that human connection right so I wanted
[10:08] to have a place where Salvadorans could
[10:09] come ask questions and learn how to self
[10:12] custody and really understand what
[10:14] Bitcoin is you know Bitcoin is not just
[10:16] Cheo wallet failing every time that
[10:18] they're trying to use it no Bitcoin
[10:20] doesn't go down when when I go to the
[10:22] supermarket and I'm trying to pay for
[10:23] food Bitcoin doesn't it's not that
[10:26] Bitcoin isn't working it's that maybe
[10:27] your system isn't working maybe the
[10:29] internet is down so just this all this
[10:32] all this
[10:33] misinformation and the ability to be
[10:35] able to solve for people is what allowed
[10:37] me and made me really want to start the
[10:38] store because I was coming across those
[10:41] projects it's interesting that you
[10:43] mention that I
[10:44] think in in our Western Civilization
[10:48] where the leaders are really skeptical
[10:50] about
[10:51] Bitcoin uh and then also the mainstream
[10:54] media is skeptical about Bitcoin
[10:56] probably the Bitcoin EF will change a
[10:58] little bit of that but but right now it
[11:00] is still like that and it comes the
[11:02] skepticism and the misconceptions in
[11:05] people's mind usually come from top down
[11:07] they come from mainstream media they
[11:08] come from governments they come from
[11:10] high officials they come from
[11:11] politicians that people trust and they
[11:13] have no idea what they're talking about
[11:15] about Bitcoin the interesting thing
[11:17] about Salvador is there's the highest
[11:20] man in the country highest man in from
[11:24] political stuff um he's talking so good
[11:27] about Bitcoin he's on bitcoin podcast he
[11:29] race Bitcoin he invited bitcoiners and
[11:32] Bitcoin to the country and still I think
[11:36] there are probably a lot of
[11:38] misconceptions uh in the in the
[11:40] community in El Salvador the adoption is
[11:42] not at 100% uh it's it's it's way lower
[11:45] than that probably um what do you think
[11:48] is are still the biggest misconceptions
[11:51] in in salador about Bitcoin and do you
[11:54] how do you see the progression going on
[11:55] like do you like how fast um for people
[11:59] that are outside of El Salvador how fast
[12:01] is the adoption growing how fast are
[12:03] people getting used to paying a Bitcoin
[12:05] or accepting Bitcoin as payment is
[12:07] probably also not uh possible in every
[12:10] store how how is the actual current yeah
[12:13] you know there's a lot of barriers to
[12:16] entry uh from the the local point of
[12:18] view right um and and the Bitcoin Beach
[12:22] project and what they did was is a great
[12:25] example and a great I think a microcosm
[12:28] of how everything across the world where
[12:31] if you look back into what they were
[12:32] trying to do when bigquint Beach program
[12:35] started they started by trying to teach
[12:36] the entrepreneurs business owners of the
[12:39] town and saying here's this new
[12:41] technology and this is how it can be
[12:43] used to benefit your business um let's
[12:46] move forward with it and the business
[12:48] owners fought back they're like no we we
[12:49] don't like this we don't know what this
[12:50] is we don't we don't really care to
[12:52] learn about this so then they went back
[12:54] to the drawing board and they're said
[12:56] and they said okay well let's start with
[12:57] the kids who are using phones every day
[13:01] understanding technology understanding
[13:02] social media works and and then so they
[13:05] went back to the drawing board started
[13:07] with the kids and that's how the Bitcoin
[13:08] Beach program actually started you know
[13:11] becoming what it is today and so there
[13:14] is a lot of misconceptions about Bitcoin
[13:16] within the community within the locals a
[13:18] lot of it is that oh it's from Bitcoin
[13:21] is from the government you know they
[13:23] they don't understand how to
[13:24] differentiate between Bitcoin and Cheapo
[13:26] wallet and the government they think
[13:28] Bitcoin is from from the government
[13:29] which is interesting when you're not
[13:31] from n you you know that it's completely
[13:33] different the government and Bitcoin are
[13:35] not related whatsoever and so it's just
[13:37] it's this misinformation which I think
[13:39] is what makes so many of sa DNE
[13:42] education projects so important uh
[13:45] because you start educating people and
[13:46] answering their questions and so there's
[13:49] the misinformation aspect of it that
[13:51] they don't trust the governments you
[13:53] know there there's been so many problems
[13:54] from the 1970s even before 50 years of
[13:58] conflict that it's going to be very
[14:00] difficult for them to just just go ahead
[14:02] and Trust the new government just like
[14:03] this now the belly Administration has
[14:06] done a great job of them trusting it
[14:07] which is why Bitcoin adoption is
[14:09] actually a lot higher than I even I
[14:12] sometimes I I'm surprised when I go to
[14:14] towns that I've never been to and I see
[14:16] Bitcoin signs up you it's not many but
[14:20] you'll find a few you know when I go to
[14:22] a random Town I'd say maybe about 5% of
[14:25] the businesses will inet Bitcoin if you
[14:27] go ahead and ask every single person
[14:29] about 5% of them will accept Bitcoin and
[14:31] that's to
[14:32] me that's way better than than even you
[14:36] think right I live in Enon so Bitcoin
[14:39] adoption here I'd say is about 70%
[14:41] pretty high I was having this
[14:42] conversation yesterday with uh with some
[14:44] other business owners of who accepts
[14:46] Bitcoin who doesn't and so when you're
[14:48] looking at the um the economy in terms
[14:53] of legal businesses businesses that have
[14:57] a a an actional actual legal
[14:59] representation versus the smaller guys
[15:02] big businesses most of them accept
[15:04] Bitcoin now we're talking about the
[15:06] Walmarts the McDonald's the hotels the
[15:09] restaurants they it's legally required
[15:13] for you to accept Bitcoin now not all of
[15:15] them do right so the adoption is
[15:17] actually going on a lot better than I
[15:20] assumed or a lot better than I think
[15:22] most people Su it's not used every day
[15:25] so there are sometimes where you know
[15:27] the POS systems are not charged there
[15:30] are sometimes when if the if it's the
[15:34] when it's the owner of the business and
[15:35] he's the only one to accept Bitcoin on
[15:37] his phone and if he's not around then
[15:38] they don't accept Bitcoin that that's a
[15:40] big one um or you know they say the
[15:43] Bitcoin network is down but it's just
[15:45] the internet is kind of slow so there
[15:47] are these obstacles that we're learning
[15:49] to use and that's where you know that's
[15:51] where we come in and we're like well
[15:52] listen if if the boss not being around
[15:54] is a problem for you to accept Bitcoin
[15:56] well we have this POS system you know
[15:58] you have the blink POS system you have
[16:00] the tan POS system where the boss
[16:02] doesn't need to be around to be able to
[16:03] accept big you can accept it and you
[16:05] don't have to worry about your employees
[16:07] sending Bitcoin out they're just
[16:08] receiving it so there are solutions it's
[16:11] about educating people on the solutions
[16:14] ultimately you leave elante where it's
[16:16] about 70% Bitcoin adoption I would say
[16:19] you go to the big city the big city I
[16:21] would say is about 10% Bitcoin adoption
[16:23] when you consider all the big players
[16:25] that are around you know I I go to the
[16:27] doctor I Pap with Bitcoin I go go to my
[16:29] dentist to pay with Bitcoin I um I'll
[16:32] pay for my food my stay I'm living on a
[16:35] Bitcoin standard now but I'm mostly
[16:37] between elante and S Sal and so in
[16:40] between those places I pay for my gas
[16:42] with Bitcoin I do my car rentals in
[16:44] Bitcoin anything that I need really at
[16:46] this point I've created this network
[16:49] around me where I'm always looking for
[16:50] new places to accept Bitcoin I still go
[16:52] visit new places and then ask and I and
[16:54] I do my part to ask every single
[16:56] business if they accept Bitcoin and if
[16:57] they say no I tell them
[16:59] well listen I I really would have loved
[17:00] to have tried your product but
[17:02] unfortunately I I live on a Bitcoin
[17:04] standard so and I'll tell you that a
[17:06] bunch of people that I'm with and I you
[17:08] know on the side I also do tours so when
[17:10] I take a whole bunch of Tours a whole
[17:12] bunch of tourists and I'm like well look
[17:14] five these 10 people behind me they all
[17:16] want your stuff but they can't pay for
[17:18] it unless it's a Bitcoin then it gets
[17:19] the brain working like oh man maybe I
[17:21] should and then next thing you know
[17:23] they're like oh no no you know what I do
[17:24] have my Cho here here you can pay with
[17:26] Bitcoin and so you know it's it's a work
[17:29] in progress and a lot of it is that
[17:32] they're not within the Salvadoran
[17:34] Community it's not used as much but just
[17:38] yesterday for example I had someone come
[17:40] into the store a Salvadoran I've never
[17:42] met him um never seen him at any of the
[17:44] meetups he lives about an hour and a
[17:46] half away from the store and he comes in
[17:49] and so salador comes in I'm like hey you
[17:51] know what are you looking for he's like
[17:53] I heard you have seed signers and so
[17:54] that first question kind of move me out
[17:56] of the water I'm like how how do you
[17:58] know about seed sign signers and he's
[18:00] like well I've been looking I've been
[18:02] looking to get the pieces and I emailed
[18:04] seed signer on their website and they
[18:05] said that you had them and then he just
[18:08] kept every question was was the perfect
[18:10] question he was asking and every time I
[18:12] made a a a suggestion he would he would
[18:15] rebuttle me with like you know good
[18:17] solid points and that's what makes me
[18:20] realize that there is some friction but
[18:23] it's this Young Generation he was he was
[18:25] young he was maybe you know 26 27 very
[18:27] young young kid
[18:29] and it just brings me hope because it's
[18:31] the younger generation ultimately that
[18:34] is the future right you know it sounds
[18:36] very cliche but it's the Young
[18:38] Generation that's the future we are
[18:40] trying to obviously have mass adoption
[18:42] and make sure that everybody gets on
[18:44] board that that that's a pipe dream
[18:47] you're never going to have a 100%
[18:49] adoption uh but with the Young
[18:50] Generation it's absolutely fantastic
[18:52] that the Ministry of Education is also
[18:54] taking um taking a big a big role in
[18:58] trying to ad ADT or trying to educate
[19:00] the kids here in which is not happening
[19:03] anywhere else and so you know technology
[19:06] can also be a big part of the barriers
[19:09] you know some people don't have phones
[19:11] some people don't know how to read
[19:13] actually can also be a problem some
[19:14] people don't know how to read right and
[19:16] so these are things that I think as we
[19:18] continue to grow as Bitcoin adoption and
[19:21] as as bitcoiners come to a we will
[19:24] figure out a way to solve these problems
[19:26] the Bitcoin Community will figure it out
[19:28] the Bitcoin community is very
[19:29] resourceful so I look forward to it and
[19:32] you know I do the one thing that I I I I
[19:34] hope bitcoiners out there are listening
[19:37] um
[19:38] please try and and do your best to learn
[19:41] to speak Spanish because that's a big
[19:43] one if people who are coming here want
[19:46] to help Bitcoin adoption speaking
[19:48] Spanish and being able to communicate
[19:50] with someone is is probably the biggest
[19:52] barrier right we you know bitcoiners
[19:56] understand the network understand NWS
[19:58] understands me of it you can't
[20:00] communicate that across to the person in
[20:02] front of you it becomes very difficult
[20:03] you know they're not they're not going
[20:05] to be super on board because they can't
[20:07] read they can't write so you need to be
[20:10] able to speak to them in a way that they
[20:12] understand um obviously being able to
[20:14] communicate with money is great but the
[20:17] the the the barriers right now are are
[20:19] very simple in my opinion to to overcome
[20:22] it's just
[20:23] education practice constant hearing of
[20:26] of bit do you accept Bitcoin do you
[20:28] accept you know blink has a fantastic
[20:30] shirt that says Bitcoin can I pay with
[20:33] Bitcoin it's these simple things just to
[20:36] get them it's like it's marketing you
[20:38] know when you take a marketing class
[20:40] they tell you that you need to hear a
[20:43] brand seven times before it actually
[20:47] gets stuck in and imprinted in your head
[20:49] so it's the same thing with Bitcoin keep
[20:52] pushing it eventually we will learn and
[20:55] I'm seeing I'm seeing that curve go up
[20:57] you know at first when when the
[20:58] government gave out $30 to everybody you
[21:01] know Bitcoin was the top of the town
[21:03] then it started going down with the bare
[21:05] market and people started forgetting
[21:06] about it but now I'm seeing that that
[21:08] Trend go back up more businesses are
[21:11] accepting Bitcoin the businesses that
[21:13] have stuck the entire you know 2019 or
[21:16] 2020 to now four years those businesses
[21:20] are there's I see a smile on their faces
[21:23] when people ask them if they accept
[21:24] bigco because they understand the value
[21:26] of their money now going up h b
[21:29] foreigners are coming tourists are
[21:31] coming to spend more money at these
[21:33] businesses and so the business across
[21:35] the street that didn't accept Bitcoin
[21:37] they might have not understand Bitcoin
[21:38] they might have been totally against it
[21:40] because of Education the disinformation
[21:42] because of the government and then not
[21:44] want to Aline themselves are not
[21:45] trusting but they're seeing all these
[21:47] people and and all these foreigners
[21:49] coming to spend Bitcoin at this place
[21:51] because they spend Bitcoin now they're
[21:53] starting to accept they're starting to
[21:55] put up signs yes we do accept because
[21:57] they want the business you know healthy
[22:00] competition and so there there are some
[22:02] barriers to entry but from my point of
[22:04] view things are getting better the
[22:06] education is there the products and
[22:09] services are getting better and as more
[22:11] bitcoiners come to El Salvador to
[22:14] experience this I think it's just going
[22:16] to continue to grow and so again the
[22:19] only the only the only tip I have is um
[22:22] do some dualingo before you come because
[22:24] it's it's that's the way that I see this
[22:26] really bit onein adoption accelerate is
[22:29] when we're able to really communicate
[22:31] with with the people that we're trying
[22:33] to do business with yeah it's amazing
[22:35] and this also leads me I mean uh I find
[22:39] it fascinating because in in Austria in
[22:42] Germany here in Europe I think in all
[22:45] the countries in Europe probably also in
[22:47] the in America Bitcoin is seen as this
[22:50] thing for criminals is this this shadowy
[22:54] thing still uh I think it's gets now
[22:56] better with the Bitcoin ETF and it's
[22:58] interesting that in El Salvador it's not
[23:01] seen as something for criminals I mean
[23:05] maybe for maybe there are someone that
[23:07] sees the government as criminals
[23:10] but but it's usually bitcoiners uh but
[23:15] uh they they don't see it for Grims they
[23:17] they con they conflicted with the
[23:18] government this is really interesting
[23:20] like how the uh just the few like where
[23:24] you live changes the few of of the
[23:26] things and also like this also perfectly
[23:29] shows that people are not critical
[23:31] thinking of the stuff they doing because
[23:34] uh someone in Austria should not think
[23:36] that's for criminals and someone
[23:38] Salvador should not think Bitcoin is
[23:40] from the government so like they should
[23:42] just uh study and educate that and I
[23:45] talked with a lot of of people how is it
[23:48] called like huan that also has the
[23:49] Spanish podcast uh in El Salvador that I
[23:52] think he's now living in in Spain but
[23:55] he's originally from El Salvador I think
[23:57] we need that I unfortunately cannot
[23:59] speak Spanish but I I will try when I I
[24:02] visit there to learn some Spanish but I
[24:04] think I cannot Master it completely I
[24:07] learned actually some Spanish in school
[24:09] maybe I can get some words out um and
[24:12] this leads me to tell you shadow shadow
[24:14] to the Germans lots of Germans out here
[24:16] and they they they try and they and they
[24:19] speak it very well so I want to say you
[24:21] know thank you to to the Germans out
[24:23] there um because that is going to break
[24:26] so many barriers you know think about it
[24:29] the the Salvador learning about Bitcoin
[24:32] they must feel a little uncomfortable
[24:34] and so the The Foreigner trying to
[24:37] explain it in Spanish also makes her
[24:39] uncomfortable and that that creates a
[24:41] real bond that creates a real connection
[24:44] whether we admit it or not and it's two
[24:45] people being out of their comfort zones
[24:48] but speaking a similar language and it's
[24:52] it's
[24:52] undescribable and so I that that that's
[24:55] just a little tip that I have you know
[24:58] if if we really want to focus on
[25:00] adoption here in Latin America which is
[25:02] is really needed when we look at
[25:04] countries like Argentina Venezuela
[25:06] Colombia you know of about over it's
[25:08] legal tender um I I think it's an
[25:11] important step for for us as bitcoiners
[25:13] coming around coming to visit these
[25:16] places because it just becomes easier
[25:18] then we can maybe accelerate that
[25:20] adoption really really cool and um you
[25:24] lived in Toronto you live now in El
[25:27] Salvador um um would you recommend for
[25:30] people that now don't know Spanish but
[25:32] they really like what Nuka is doing they
[25:35] are kind of frustrated what the
[25:37] government maybe in Germany maybe in
[25:38] London maybe where wherever it is are
[25:41] frustrated with their government and
[25:43] they're like when B is doing they like
[25:45] what's going on in bit in in Bitcoin
[25:47] land in El Salvador uh would you
[25:50] recommend for them to just like move
[25:52] there if they if they are able to and if
[25:55] if you recommend that like why and how
[25:58] yeah no 100% I mean everybody comes from
[26:02] different situations different
[26:03] circumstances so I can I can recommend
[26:06] it the way I see it and maybe you know I
[26:09] think this might resonate people
[26:10] listening to your podcast is when you
[26:14] when you hear about Bitcoin if you like
[26:16] if you're not technical the best way to
[26:18] learn is to just immerse yourself you
[26:20] need to understand when I started
[26:22] finding out and hearing about Bitcoin I
[26:24] didn't know the difference between a
[26:25] seed phrase a pass phrase a master none
[26:27] of this stuff
[26:28] but how did I learn well you just you
[26:31] you just deep dive you know you just
[26:33] start listening to the podcast you start
[26:35] hearing the words just repeated it over
[26:37] and over and over again and at first it
[26:39] feels uncomfortable maybe man am I dumb
[26:42] like I don't understand what any of
[26:44] these things are but you have to reverse
[26:46] yourself so that's the same thing I
[26:48] recommend if you want to come here to be
[26:50] in a you don't have to know Spanish but
[26:53] it definitely it helps but when you're
[26:55] down here you're going to immerse
[26:56] yourself and you're going to learn
[26:58] because because there there is no other
[26:59] option you want to communicate with
[27:00] people you're going to have to practice
[27:02] your Spanish uh and it's the same thing
[27:05] with Bitcoin you want to learn about
[27:06] Bitcoin you have to immerse yourself get
[27:08] into the technicals hear those those
[27:10] same words and messages over and over
[27:12] again because you're going to want to
[27:13] figure it out so I I would recommend it
[27:15] for anybody who who's tired of of it to
[27:18] come down to a Sone see what it's like
[27:21] find your place the great thing about in
[27:23] is you have the beach you have the
[27:25] mountains you have a few cities so you
[27:27] can kind of find you know what it is
[27:28] that you're looking for um you know the
[27:31] Bitcoin is concentrated mostly toon s
[27:35] salvad now there's Berlin Berlin in
[27:38] salvon which is on the east side of the
[27:39] country so there are little pockets
[27:41] where it's really concentrated but you
[27:43] can find kind of anything in between
[27:46] which is absolutely fantastic so I
[27:48] recommend you know if you have some
[27:50] friends that are already down here or
[27:52] you can always reach out to me get down
[27:55] here see it for yourself find a a Place
[27:58] physically geographically if you don't
[28:01] like the hot weather go up into the
[28:02] mountains a little bit um and then start
[28:05] you know start creating that Community
[28:07] start putting yourself into these
[28:09] situations that at first may not be
[28:11] comfortable but the one thing that I
[28:13] keep hearing and the reason that I came
[28:15] down here really is the warmth of the
[28:18] people how happy everybody seems to be
[28:21] how accepting everybody seems to be when
[28:24] you come into a new town let me tell you
[28:27] everybody knows you're not from there
[28:29] and when it's a small town of a few
[28:31] hundred people when you when I showed up
[28:33] everybody knew I wasn't from here and
[28:35] the first question was where you from
[28:37] what are you doing here and if you just
[28:38] tell them I I I I want experience what
[28:40] this is like they're going to show you
[28:42] they're GNA invite you into their phone
[28:44] they're going to invite you into their
[28:46] favorite places they're going to show
[28:47] you around they want you to feel
[28:49] comfortable and it's something that I've
[28:50] never not never because I have fell to
[28:52] traveling and travel to certain places
[28:55] where people are very inviting but
[28:57] that's the one un commmon thing I keep
[28:59] hearing about people that come to visit
[29:01] and s Everyone is very inviting everyone
[29:03] wants to invite you to eat everyone
[29:05] wants you to have a drink with them and
[29:07] and that's part of the culture that was
[29:09] the culture that I was missing out of
[29:11] Toronto was that family oriented culture
[29:13] of let's have dinner together let's
[29:15] share let's share around the dinner
[29:17] table that's that's that's normal here
[29:20] you know when you go to a restaurant
[29:22] when you go to aadia there aren't these
[29:24] tables that are separated it's kind of
[29:26] like one large table and you got to you
[29:28] want to eat there you have to find and
[29:30] and sit beside people that you've never
[29:32] spoken to before and unless you want to
[29:34] be that guy that doesn't speak at all
[29:36] during dinner conversations then you're
[29:38] going to have to make conversation with
[29:40] people that you never met before and so
[29:43] I would 100% recommend anybody who wants
[29:45] to come down here um you know do it
[29:48] there there's really nothing to be
[29:50] nothing to be afraid of other then maybe
[29:52] you just get lost and you lose your
[29:54] signal but we have technology Google
[29:58] translate it's it's gonna it's a lot
[30:00] easier to get around these days it's a
[30:03] much safer country so you don't have to
[30:04] worry about any of that anymore which is
[30:06] absolutely fantastic takes a whole load
[30:08] off people's shoulders um you land at
[30:10] the airport people do speak English so
[30:13] if you speak English you you should be
[30:15] okay um and then you just go and you
[30:18] look around it's absolutely fantastic
[30:20] I'd recommend you know getting a car
[30:23] using the the tools Google Maps doing
[30:26] some reading material before the Planet
[30:29] U lots of Bitcoin bloggers or or Bitcoin
[30:32] podcasters that speak about their
[30:34] experience come down visitting something
[30:36] they come down visit Bitcoin Beach lots
[30:38] of people with very similar stories and
[30:41] then you'll be able to pick up pointers
[30:43] from here so that that would be my
[30:45] recommendation you know if you if you're
[30:47] intrigued and you want to see what even
[30:51] if you want to see what is possible
[30:52] where you're from then it's necessary
[30:55] for you to come down to a come down to
[30:58] the Bitcoin Beach see what people are
[31:00] doing and see what you can what you can
[31:02] take from that what you can learn and
[31:04] maybe you go and you start your own
[31:05] circular economy whatever City you're
[31:07] from but it's very inspirational what's
[31:10] happening down here so I definitely
[31:11] recommend it to anybody who's interested
[31:14] how hard is it to get like a residency
[31:17] there it's like some countries it's
[31:18] really hard to get a a c there I notice
[31:23] it myself because I have an Indian
[31:24] girlfriend who she moved from India now
[31:27] here to Austria and I just know the
[31:29] hurdles like you have to comply with so
[31:32] many stuffs like you need so long and
[31:34] you you have to work with a company if
[31:36] you change the company there's like
[31:38] complicated stuff there but that's
[31:39] Austria Austria complicated I guess Sal
[31:43] is easier El is easier it is a
[31:46] commitment if you're looking to come
[31:48] down here especially a time commitment
[31:50] you have to spend uh I believe about
[31:52] eight months of the year in the country
[31:54] so it's it's it's a bit of a time
[31:56] commitment right so it's not difficult
[31:58] the the government definitely is looking
[32:00] to bring right people into the country
[32:03] uh and and offer incentives so it's and
[32:06] it's getting better you know with with
[32:08] people who are coming making noise and
[32:10] you know telling the government hey we
[32:12] think this is better the one thing that
[32:13] I do tell people is what makes this
[32:16] place great for me is that in the
[32:18] governments that I've seen and where I
[32:21] live it's almost like the government
[32:23] wants to shut down every idea that comes
[32:25] from the people it's like if it comes
[32:27] from the people we're going to shut it
[32:28] down we're going to make it super
[32:29] difficult for you to do this whereas the
[32:32] it's the opposite they may not help in
[32:35] the way that we'd like the great thing
[32:37] that they do is they don't try to stop
[32:38] you you know they'll they'll let things
[32:40] kind of happen and so that's what I'm
[32:42] seeing happening here in this a little
[32:44] so it's not easy but they're not going
[32:47] to make it hard on you if that makes any
[32:49] sense right so and it's just it's just a
[32:52] bit of a time you do have to have a time
[32:53] you have to have patience you know to
[32:57] want to be down here here uh and then
[32:59] you'll do it I I know many people who
[33:00] are on that path right now and I think
[33:03] it's few and far between the ones who
[33:05] come try it out and don't enjoy it and
[33:08] go back I don't think I've met anybody
[33:10] actually has come down here is in the
[33:13] process and then said no it's too
[33:15] difficult gone back everybody comes they
[33:18] start thinking do I really want to make
[33:20] this big commitment because it is a big
[33:21] commitment but once they're once they're
[33:23] in it I don't think I've made anybody
[33:25] who regrets that decision
[33:28] really really cool uh and just like for
[33:31] comparison uh in Austria you need around
[33:35] like 500 to ,000 for rent uh for normal
[33:39] place of course there are stuff to rent
[33:41] for like
[33:43] €300 but then you have a shared kitchen
[33:45] then you have like a really like a low
[33:48] quality of of of of Blaze uh then you
[33:52] need another like 200 maybe 300 to to to
[33:56] eat your that that you can eat and there
[33:59] like of course insurance and taxes and
[34:01] stuff like that but how how expensive is
[34:04] it compared to like the the western
[34:06] civilization Austria America London how
[34:10] much euros dollars would you say you
[34:13] need a month roughly to to live in to
[34:15] come by in in El Salvador yeah if you
[34:18] wanted to live in San Salvador in the
[34:20] city or or even some of the smaller
[34:22] places $ th dollar a month will catch
[34:24] you
[34:25] by US dollars um and so you know rent
[34:29] for a house can be small little place
[34:31] just for
[34:32] yourself3 $400 $500 a month but that's
[34:37] in you know we're talking just C certain
[34:39] parts of s it's all based depends on
[34:42] community when you're here Inon R just
[34:45] rent can be $ thousand a month so it
[34:49] really varies you know depends on where
[34:51] you want to live but you can get by just
[34:54] a single person with $1,000 a month and
[34:56] live a very comfortable life live close
[34:58] to close enough to the beach um have
[35:01] your basic necessities covered have
[35:03] great food that's the one thing the food
[35:05] here is fantastic and it's not as costly
[35:07] as the rest of the world is my point of
[35:10] view is a little different because I do
[35:11] come from Toronto which is one of most
[35:13] expensive cities in the world so for me
[35:16] it was it was it was great you know but
[35:18] for some people depending on where
[35:20] you're coming from they look at inste of
[35:21] a like it's not as cheap as I thought it
[35:23] was and I think it really depends on
[35:25] where you're coming from so kind of
[35:27] right in the middle you have access this
[35:30] this is what I tell people actually if
[35:32] you want to live a luxurious lifestyle
[35:34] you have access to that lifestyle but it
[35:37] is luxurious and it cost a lot of money
[35:39] if you want to have a basic lifestyle
[35:41] you also have access to that and it's
[35:43] not as costly you know you can grab
[35:45] yourself a nice small little motorcycle
[35:48] pay because you know there's no snow um
[35:51] pay you know $40 a month in gas um your
[35:55] your electricity could be $20 a month
[35:57] month your water $10 a month um your
[36:00] internet 20 $30 a month your cell phone
[36:03] $10 a month your rent four4 $500 a month
[36:08] and you're good you know and then your
[36:10] food so you're at about $1,000 a month
[36:12] and you're you're good so and and then
[36:17] you when you look at it that the minimum
[36:19] wage in s Lo is about $400 a month and
[36:22] people are surviving off of that then it
[36:24] means that you can you can as well if
[36:26] you want to live that way
[36:28] lifestyle so there there's a good
[36:30] balance just depends on what it is that
[36:32] you're looking for you you'll find it
[36:33] all I'll tell you that much you you'll
[36:35] find whatever
[36:37] lifestyle really cool I think is a place
[36:40] I have to visit in I think November is
[36:42] the Bitcoin conference uh I'm really
[36:45] close like from my point of view really
[36:47] close to Salvador When I visit the
[36:49] Bitcoin conference uh in I think July in
[36:53] America in Nashville yeah first time
[36:56] ever to be
[36:58] in America in that side of of the world
[37:00] I'm really looking for and I hope I can
[37:04] make it this year to Salvador I I made
[37:07] so many uh contacts already on the
[37:10] podcast I had so many on with James so
[37:13] many with f with so many people that are
[37:15] in Salvador and I'm really looking
[37:17] forward to meet you all um but this kind
[37:20] of brings me to the my next question how
[37:23] how important do you think is El
[37:24] Salvador in this whole global Bitcoin
[37:28] narrative because a lot of Bitcoin as
[37:30] are talking about it a lot of it comes
[37:32] up in a lot of conversations it's comes
[37:35] up in negative but also positive uh
[37:37] conversations uh um yeah there's there's
[37:41] so much going on like if you talk with
[37:44] people outside of the Bitcoin community
[37:46] in uh in the Western Hemisphere they are
[37:48] talking about El salador oh this is
[37:50] there is this this leader this is like a
[37:53] dictator uh but then I ask them okay
[37:55] what did he do what's what's
[37:57] what what's bad about it and they
[37:59] usually like the they just say oh it's a
[38:01] dictator but then I go into Bitcoin
[38:03] community and I talk with people
[38:05] actually having contact with El Salvador
[38:08] having actually contact with people
[38:09] there and they're like it's a much safer
[38:12] place now it's a place with more tourism
[38:15] place with more prosperity it's a place
[38:18] of hope and not of depression now uh so
[38:22] I really think El salv is really glowing
[38:25] but how is this El salvor St
[38:28] important or how important do you think
[38:29] it is in the whole Bitcoin Global
[38:32] adoption narrative I think it's very
[38:35] important um you know you mentioned it
[38:36] right off of that there was it's a it's
[38:39] a Beacon of Hope and there's not that
[38:42] many places like that in the world right
[38:44] now you know coming for where I'm coming
[38:46] from and and seeing people where they're
[38:48] moving from you know we have lots of
[38:50] people from KRA lots of people from the
[38:51] US UK Europe different parts of Europe
[38:55] and so I think it's very important this
[38:58] is Ground Zero SE being the first place
[39:01] in the world to make Bitcoin legal
[39:03] tender and to to answer your question
[39:06] and I know it might not be the answer
[39:07] people looking for but it takes time you
[39:10] know these things aren't going to happen
[39:11] overnight and you're not going to get
[39:13] the answer overnight either and is he a
[39:17] dictator knows definitely you ask the S
[39:20] dor we're definitely gonna say no 90%
[39:23] approval rating says he's not a dictator
[39:25] at least to the southern door hands to
[39:26] us in here
[39:28] uh but then the rest of the world who
[39:30] you know has different news outlets
[39:32] saying different things about him and
[39:34] using certain points as a negative so I
[39:38] think it's it's it's vital to where
[39:41] we're going and it's it's it's where
[39:44] everything's started so I think we look
[39:47] over the next 10 years I think that's
[39:49] really going to dictate how important he
[39:51] some is to to bitcoin and to the the
[39:55] global economy and to just what's
[39:56] happening all the world I I'm a big
[39:59] believer in the administration in the
[40:03] direction that it's moving in the
[40:05] direction of that Bitcoin and bitcoiners
[40:08] are taking it there's such a large
[40:10] concentration of super intelligent
[40:13] people very well off and with great
[40:17] projects and just great vision that I I
[40:22] really don't see a place right now where
[40:24] El Salvador fails at its mission
[40:27] the people that are here are putting in
[40:29] the work and it takes a while for that
[40:32] work to really flourish for it to become
[40:34] something and so I'm excited for what's
[40:36] to come I'm excited to see elabor in 10
[40:39] years where and I think Stacy and Max
[40:42] and Stacy have said this getting into El
[40:45] salador now is like getting into Bitcoin
[40:47] back in 2011 you know nobody knew where
[40:50] Bitcoin was going to be you know 10
[40:52] years 14 years later did anybody think
[40:55] Bitcoin was going to be at $70,000 give
[40:58] or take I doubt it right and so people
[41:02] were excited back in 2011 about it
[41:04] getting to
[41:05] $10 so I think the same thing and I
[41:08] agree with Max and Stacy when they say
[41:10] getting to El salador being here right
[41:13] now it's like getting into Bitcoin in
[41:15] 2011 it's it's just going in the right
[41:18] direction lots of people working towards
[41:21] you know a better future and I think
[41:23] it's very important because 10 years
[41:25] from now Al saer has been that example
[41:28] other countries that are going through
[41:30] similar difficulties similar challenges
[41:32] with crime you know with the depression
[41:36] and the economy just doing really bad or
[41:39] you know their their their dollar
[41:41] crashing El salador is going to be that
[41:43] Beacon of Hope and it's going to be if
[41:45] you can follow what El Salvador and what
[41:47] the administration has done then you're
[41:49] going to have an
[41:50] opportunity to better yourself you know
[41:53] it's up to you whether you take that
[41:54] opportunity and if you do good or bad
[41:56] but if it's going to be that that leader
[42:00] and I really look forward to seeing
[42:02] what's to come I look forward to being a
[42:04] part of it play my little part in what's
[42:06] going to happen here inone and I know
[42:09] many other projects are hoping for the
[42:10] same and we're just putting in the work
[42:13] we know that if we do that do the work
[42:16] then 10 years from now I can't even
[42:19] imagine what was going to look like at
[42:21] 10 years so I really you know I say that
[42:24] to everyone around here if you're
[42:25] looking to build if want to do something
[42:28] um you're tired of where you're where
[42:30] you're currently living come to and you
[42:34] don't necessarily have to stay here but
[42:35] it's a good place to get some
[42:37] inspiration and then bring that back
[42:39] because ultimately we want the whole
[42:41] world to be to have Bitcoin adoption we
[42:44] want 99% we want hyperbitcoinization and
[42:47] for that to happen you need to come to
[42:49] you need to see what's going on need to
[42:51] learn from the people here and then you
[42:53] need to go back to your place and and
[42:55] and then spread that word and know do
[42:57] the things in your way obviously because
[43:00] every every geographical place is a
[43:02] little different different cultures but
[43:04] it's a good place to come learn so I
[43:06] would I would say El Salvador is right
[43:09] now is going to lead by examp and I
[43:12] really I really I don't hope for the
[43:15] best I know that I'm going to and myself
[43:19] and I'm not speaking for other projects
[43:21] but we're doing what we can to make sure
[43:23] that the outcome is what we want it to
[43:26] be what we want to be is it's a better
[43:28] world as bin 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only
[43:32] from day one and they teach and preach
[43:35] self custody this is my goto exchange
[43:38] when someone asks me oh where can I buy
[43:40] my Bitcoin from this is the easiest
[43:43] entry for bitcoiners and if you want
[43:46] lower fees Plus at the same time support
[43:49] this podcast use code Robin and click
[43:51] the link in the description yeah I think
[43:54] um I had a podcast with Luke mage
[43:57] and he said something about uh in the
[44:00] last three years the only thing
[44:02] outperforming Bitcoin was real estate in
[44:05] El
[44:06] Salvador wow really he said that yes
[44:10] Luke mikage said that and he is making
[44:12] then an argument that uh Argentina is
[44:15] also on the way up and also really doing
[44:17] good and I think he thinks about
[44:20] investing in Argentina and El salvad
[44:22] Real Estate something like that uh but I
[44:25] did not go really deep in that but uh
[44:28] yeah Salvador is is a good place and if
[44:30] you like uh if if
[44:33] you massive Bitcoin OG Maxi with a lot
[44:36] of Bitcoin and you want to somehow
[44:39] invest in something related to bitcoin I
[44:42] think El Salvador is some a nice place
[44:44] it has a true potential of course it's
[44:46] not Bitcoin like El is still a country
[44:49] and a country is like a company when the
[44:51] leadership all of the sudden turns for
[44:53] the worse as Salvador can be also really
[44:56] bad in 10 years
[44:57] but as it as it goes now it seems really
[45:01] good it seems really positive uh and so
[45:05] it's it's it's it's like an investment
[45:07] you can make an investment in salador
[45:09] and in
[45:11] in um and it's you can do it but yeah
[45:15] the the basic basic thing is like
[45:17] Bitcoin is a savings device and maybe
[45:19] you find some really good investment
[45:21] outside and I think elav is an
[45:22] interesting interesting country to look
[45:24] at and this is why I also invite so many
[45:27] people from El Salvador to this podcast
[45:29] because it will be so interesting to see
[45:32] when we have El Salvador in 10 years and
[45:35] then I can look back at the podcast I
[45:37] did in 2024 2023 with the elabor people
[45:42] and say like oh this is how they talked
[45:44] about and now it's actually like that
[45:46] and then then I can clip that and make
[45:48] this nice content make a documentation
[45:51] all of that like I that's why I'm so
[45:54] passionate I'm doing every day a podcast
[45:56] and public every day I'm recording every
[45:58] day I just want to um grasp the Bitcoin
[46:02] adoption on this channel and El Salvador
[46:05] is an an extremely important part of
[46:07] that that's why I want to talk with
[46:09] everyone that is willing to talk Bitcoin
[46:11] in the salador uh even though the
[46:14] stories are really similar so it's like
[46:16] not something completely new but uh it's
[46:19] important and as you said before
[46:21] marketing you need to hear something
[46:22] more and more so like H it's it's we we
[46:26] we need to we need to like even with
[46:28] self custody I have people from self-
[46:30] custody uh every time on and on and on
[46:34] like I had like five six seven podcasts
[46:37] on the topic of self- custody why it's
[46:39] important what we should do so this is I
[46:41] will do it over and over again till
[46:43] everybody gets it it's the only way to
[46:45] learn you know you have to immerse
[46:46] yourself you have to hear the same words
[46:49] in terms over and over again that's how
[46:50] you're going to learn Spanish if you
[46:51] want to come down here and have to do
[46:53] the work and uh you know I think the
[46:57] people who are
[46:58] here I can speak for myself you know
[47:01] coming from a financial background in
[47:03] has a lot of upside right a lot of
[47:05] upside a lot of value so I'm betting on
[47:09] that but not only betting on that I am
[47:12] part of this of this world that we're
[47:14] living in and I can actually have a
[47:16] little bit of an impact and I feel like
[47:18] a lot of my peers here in this I to feel
[47:20] the same we're doing what we can to have
[47:23] some impact and then and then not really
[47:26] hope but we're just working towards that
[47:27] this will turn into something a lot
[47:29] bigger than it more than just a little
[47:31] country maybe one day the entire world
[47:35] now an an little bit more difficult
[47:37] question uh do you have any specific
[47:40] country in mind that might be the next
[47:43] El
[47:45] Salvador um that's a tough one I think
[47:49] it'll be another Central American
[47:53] country for sure just with the proximity
[47:55] to it um like a Mexico or Guatemala
[48:00] oras maybe not a nicwa but something
[48:03] close to it I think you know we have we
[48:06] have so many similar problems so many
[48:08] similar issues uh and I think they're
[48:12] going to see it firsthand because
[48:14] they're seeing you know the tourists
[48:16] going maybe to all the tourists that
[48:18] were going to Mexico maybe start
[48:19] diverging down to and then Mexico sees
[48:21] that as as as a challenge to to their
[48:24] status um so I do see one of the you
[48:27] know it's one of the Central American
[48:29] countries kind of being on board before
[48:30] anybody else maybe Argentina with the
[48:33] new regime that's there the
[48:35] administration so uh I definitely see it
[48:37] as a Latin American country just because
[48:39] I also see Bitcoin solving a lot of the
[48:42] problems there there's a lot of similar
[48:45] issues happening in the Latin American
[48:47] countries where they're just so reliant
[48:50] on the old system so that's uh I can't
[48:54] give you a perfect guess but it'll be a
[48:55] Latin America
[48:58] and what would you do if there was no
[49:00] Bitcoin like what would you what do you
[49:03] think you would work on or study on if
[49:06] there was no Bitcoin that's a great
[49:09] question uh if there was no Bitcoin oh
[49:13] man I don't know I probably just focus
[49:15] on traveling more and more of the world
[49:17] learning more um maybe trying to be more
[49:20] self-sufficient you know buying land in
[49:24] Sal and then just just disappear and
[49:27] trying to become as self-sufficient as
[49:28] possible build a little farm build a
[49:30] little Citadel if there's no Bitcoin
[49:32] then I want some cows some coconut some
[49:34] mango trees some lime trees some chicken
[49:37] stock and uh and then disappear and call
[49:40] it a day I could imagine you on those
[49:43] kind of farms I really love
[49:45] it uh we having an end routine on the
[49:47] podcast where the previous guest asked a
[49:49] question for the next guest H and uh
[49:52] your question is is Bitcoin for you
[49:56] Divine is Bitcoin Divine for
[50:02] you that's a tough question
[50:06] um I would
[50:09] say I would say yes I would lean towards
[50:12] yes because of its
[50:15] Purity and it really I think what brings
[50:18] all the bitcoiners together is is that
[50:22] we it brings us to a Level Playing
[50:24] Field and for all these people from all
[50:27] these different places to come together
[50:30] from Geographic places and just
[50:32] different backgrounds to come together
[50:34] then it's something special and to me
[50:35] that's what divine Divine to me means
[50:38] special authentic and pure um and so the
[50:41] fact that so many people that don't know
[50:43] each other grew up in totally different
[50:46] parts of the world and we can come
[50:48] together then to me that that that is
[50:50] divine so yeah I I will Le towards yes
[50:53] please yeah it's definitely like that I
[50:56] think it's uh it's it's a great thing
[50:58] it's I also lean towards it's a
[51:01] discovery and not it's not created uh if
[51:04] if so Nakamoto did not do it uh then it
[51:07] would have just came somewhere else like
[51:09] we were ready for that kind of
[51:11] technology for that kind of an idea so
[51:14] we kind of discovered it stumbled upon
[51:16] it and we did not create it of course
[51:18] there was someone creating the code uh
[51:21] but it's it's more discovery of than the
[51:24] creation yeah uh then uh thank you for
[51:26] your time Ronnie and I really thank you
[51:28] for for giving us insights and
