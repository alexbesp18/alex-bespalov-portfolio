[00:00] we are on the brink of major bull market
[00:02] engaging more with the Bitcoin only
[00:04] Community is where I really learned
[00:05] about you know Austrian economics and
[00:07] what makes sound money what is good
[00:09] money what is bad money that's why we
[00:12] went all in Bitcoin and also decided
[00:14] that we will not add any others we have
[00:16] also built a team around that all the
[00:18] investors that we have on boarded are
[00:20] really in that same mindset and are
[00:23] aligned with that Bitcoin only Vision
[00:25] when I see the adoption of Bitcoin we
[00:27] see El Salvador we see Argentina we see
[00:30] Nigeria we see so many poor countries
[00:32] that have to adopt Bitcoin because they
[00:34] frankly have no
[00:36] choice I triy to find one of the first
[00:39] tweets you you ever made you have to
[00:41] scroll for hours probably and second oh
[00:44] my God yeah yeah it's it's there's an an
[00:47] feature on on Twitter where you can
[00:49] search uh for dates like you can search
[00:52] every I want to see everything before
[00:53] 20120 and I just did that and there was
[00:56] like one tweet uh uh like December 2019
[01:00] where you talk about the future of cpto
[01:02] assets and the benefits of tokenization
[01:05] and it was interesting because you like
[01:07] it was like this not Bitcoin only
[01:10] mindset and I think in April first April
[01:14] of 2020 so like four five months later
[01:17] you founded a Bitcoin only company uh
[01:20] like what changed in the time or was
[01:23] really not intended to be Bitcoin only
[01:25] yeah I think that's something that a lot
[01:28] of people don't know is that we didn't
[01:30] start
[01:31] necessarily um consciously as a Bitcoin
[01:33] only startup we we started as a Bitcoin
[01:35] only startup just because we had to
[01:37] start somewhere but from the beginning
[01:39] we were actually then the team back then
[01:42] which was also a bit different than the
[01:43] team now uh thought that we just want to
[01:46] give easy access to crypto and uh so
[01:50] crypto you basically the biggest um
[01:53] thing was Bitcoin right so then we
[01:55] started with Bitcoin but we were already
[01:57] thinking about adding ethereum for sure
[01:59] because the two people I actually then
[02:01] worked with and Adam my co-founder who
[02:04] was also on this podcast previously who
[02:06] was not yet really involved then but
[02:09] these two guys one was a tech and one
[02:11] was more like a business guy they both
[02:14] were e not eth Maxis but like more eth
[02:18] than anything else so we just started
[02:21] with bit because was easy and it was the
[02:23] most well known Etc but we we are we're
[02:26] already thinking about adding others
[02:29] fortunately then um actually this was
[02:31] just also a learning process for me and
[02:34] for the team um and we got a lot of uh
[02:38] Community feedback that this this is not
[02:42] you know a good idea um and especially
[02:45] just bitcoiners and the Bitcoin Maxi
[02:47] crowd on Twitter Etc really liked what
[02:50] we did you know making it easy uh
[02:52] accessible for everyone from 10 bucks
[02:55] within a couple of minutes buy Bitcoin
[02:57] and set up a savings plan with a very
[02:59] nice userfriendly mobile app Etc so we
[03:01] just saw that this concept that we did
[03:04] worked really well with bitcoiners
[03:06] because also mostly also because of the
[03:08] sa savings plan right so Bitcoin savings
[03:11] technology digital gold Etc uh you don't
[03:13] see a lot of eth or tesos or cardano
[03:17] people who want to set up a long-term
[03:19] Savings Plan basically what they want to
[03:21] do is gamble you know speculate you do
[03:24] iOS and and you know just make a lot of
[03:28] money fast um by trading and speculating
[03:32] Etc but they are not really in this
[03:33] savings mindset but what I Al always
[03:36] wanted to do is you know have have a an
[03:39] easy way of long-term um saving and
[03:43] taking control of your own finances Etc
[03:46] and I was just first I I thought crypto
[03:49] in general could be the solution for
[03:51] this problem and only in this process
[03:54] also with starting a company and
[03:56] engaging more with uh the the different
[04:00] crypto communities and engaging more
[04:02] with the Bitcoin only Community is where
[04:04] I really learned about you know Austrian
[04:06] economics and what makes sound money uh
[04:10] what what is good money what is bad
[04:12] money and Etc and the the digital gold
[04:16] narrative and and all that I only
[04:18] learned B basically while I was starting
[04:21] the company and so that's why we
[04:24] probably a couple of months later then
[04:26] really went all in Bitcoin and also
[04:28] decided
[04:30] that we will not add any others but
[04:32] really stay Bitcoin only and focus on
[04:34] improving the feature set for Bitcoin
[04:38] but not adding all the other uh altcoins
[04:40] and to this day um we have also built a
[04:43] team around that all the investors that
[04:45] we have on board it are really um in
[04:49] that same mindset and are aligned with
[04:51] that Bitcoin only Vision this was not
[04:53] always easy of course to explain them
[04:56] but um I think now this this in
[04:58] hindsight was very very good decision um
[05:01] and we keep keep developing forward um
[05:05] with this Bitcoin only mindset of course
[05:07] yeah I remember some tweets you you sent
[05:10] out where you showed some slides and you
[05:13] said basically like oh I'm now at those
[05:16] investors and I try to explain to them
[05:19] why we're not adding ethereum why we not
[05:21] adding kadano and we're staying at
[05:23] Bitcoin only it's a it's a fascinating
[05:25] story that you started out with the mind
[05:27] like we are starting a crypto Exchange
[05:29] change and in the process and also with
[05:32] the feedback of of bitcoiners you
[05:35] focused on bitcoin only and then learned
[05:37] about Bitcoin it's fascinating story um
[05:41] it's also fascinating that that Swiss is
[05:44] so Bitcoin friendly like so because I
[05:47] always see uh when I see the adoption of
[05:50] of Bitcoin um we see as Salvador we see
[05:54] Argentina we see Nigeria we see so many
[05:57] poor countries that have the up Bitcoin
[06:00] because they frankly have no choice uh
[06:03] but then there's also Swiss where
[06:05] there's Lugano and there's other
[06:07] examples where like Swiss has a like the
[06:10] one of the most sound money systems in
[06:13] the whole Fiat realm if if you you could
[06:16] make an argument for that but still uh
[06:19] other richer countries don't get Bitcoin
[06:22] why do swis people get Bitcoin over like
[06:25] Germany over like uh America so much
[06:29] more as as I feel it like it's a
[06:31] subjective feeling I had from Swiss
[06:33] people I don't know if in general the
[06:36] data shows that Swiss people uh are
[06:39] adopting Bitcoin more than other similar
[06:42] countries um I know that around 15% of
[06:46] Swiss people own Bitcoin or have ever
[06:49] kind of touch Bitcoin or invested in
[06:51] Bitcoin that to compared to other
[06:54] European countries is not like huge it's
[06:57] maybe a bit more uh but I don't think
[06:59] that Switzerland is the European country
[07:02] with the highest uh ratio there I think
[07:05] Germany must be around 10 maybe 11 12%
[07:09] um so it's not like a huge difference
[07:11] where we do see a lot of bottom up
[07:14] adoption is the countries that you have
[07:16] um mentioned like El Salvador I don't
[07:19] know how much it is maybe 20 25% I know
[07:22] Nigeria is like 30 plus percent so these
[07:25] are the the countries that really need
[07:27] it are the ones that really also adopt
[07:29] it and use it not only the early
[07:31] adopters but also like later adoption is
[07:34] is moving
[07:35] forward in Switzerland is still I would
[07:39] say still you know early adopter phase
[07:42] um some Innovative people some nerds um
[07:46] and some you know people that like to
[07:49] invest Etc are uh touching Bitcoin um
[07:53] but mostly the the broader population is
[07:56] still very passive and also the media
[07:59] Etc is still you know they still write
[08:02] about the energy consumption of Bitcoin
[08:04] is still the old the old thinking so I
[08:07] don't think that there's a lot of
[08:09] differences in that area to Germany for
[08:13] example I think where there's a big
[08:15] difference is that our from a top down
[08:17] perspective like our government and our
[08:21] uh legislation regulatory system is very
[08:24] open uh to not only Bitcoin but also
[08:28] other innov Innovations in general and
[08:31] we're also quite of democratic and
[08:34] decentralized Country from an
[08:37] organizational point of view so we do
[08:39] let these things happen I think more um
[08:42] than other countries like for example
[08:44] Germany and that's why not only Bitcoin
[08:46] but also all the whole blockchain crypto
[08:48] ecosystem has started to settle in
[08:51] Switzerland um namely in zuk called the
[08:54] crypto Valley um so with the ethereum
[08:57] foundation the tesos foundation I think
[08:59] think the cardano foundation a lot of
[09:00] these foundations have settled in
[09:02] Switzerland just because the Regulatory
[09:04] and legal and compliance Frameworks are
[09:06] very good um for these kind of
[09:09] Innovations if you want to call it like
[09:10] that um and also there's great talent
[09:13] there's a lot of
[09:15] stability um the financial Market
[09:17] authorities are very open so you can
[09:19] actually discuss things with them um and
[09:22] they actually listen from time to time
[09:25] um there are a lot of sandbox
[09:27] environment things that you can do a lot
[09:30] of uh fintech especially fintech
[09:32] Innovation where Bitcoin blockchain
[09:34] crypto Etc is also on D roof um without
[09:38] you know having a banking license from
[09:39] the start but until you have a certain
[09:42] amount of users Etc you can just do
[09:43] stuff you can try things out so that's
[09:45] very good for Innovation um the
[09:47] regulatory system is is neutral to
[09:50] technology so it's they don't um
[09:54] regulate blockchain technology Bitcoin
[09:57] Etc differently than you know you know
[09:59] AI or whatever they just regulate these
[10:02] startup companies technology startup
[10:04] companies the same so it's very fair
[10:06] it's very open it's
[10:08] Democratic um so there are a lot of um
[10:11] positive things I think that led to a
[10:13] lot of this industry settle in in
[10:17] Switzerland and not elsewhere um that's
[10:19] why you have a lot of companies a lot of
[10:21] employees Etc here uh in that industry
[10:24] but I don't think necessarily that there
[10:26] are much more bitcoiners uh in the
[10:29] population in Switzerland than in any
[10:32] other uh countries in Europe interesting
[10:34] that that top down uh does not affect
[10:37] the bottom up too much uh it's an
[10:41] interesting perspective never looked at
[10:42] at it uh in that way also like I think
[10:45] in Swiss you can pay taxes in Bitcoin
[10:47] right somewhere is it
[10:50] everywhere so we also have 26 different
[10:53] canons right like you guys have
[10:54] bundeslander we have cant and every C is
[10:57] very different in terms of tax and and
[10:59] all kind of uh aspects so I think you
[11:02] can pay taxes partly I don't think you
[11:05] could pay like 20K in tax uh in in
[11:08] Bitcoin but partly up to a certain limit
[11:12] in zuk crypto valy thing but also a very
[11:15] small Canton you know other other than
[11:17] that it's not a very important Canton um
[11:20] and maybe now in Lugano where I live in
[11:23] Burn Canon of burn I don't think I'm I'm
[11:25] pretty sure you cannot pay your tax in
[11:27] Bitcoin so it's not a it's not a Swiss
[11:29] thing it's maybe one or two or three
[11:31] cents that's it yeah things are yeah
[11:35] even that they open to it I think it's
[11:37] fascinating I could never imagine
[11:38] Austria being open to that
[11:41] honestly yeah yeah Austria and Germany
[11:43] probably a bit the same uh did you uh
[11:46] you started business administration and
[11:48] psychology as I heard on Adam podcast
[11:51] right it's an and and you worked in a a
[11:55] bank also before yeah kind of yeah so I
[12:00] I did study psychology and business
[12:02] administration because Psychology was my
[12:04] major and uh business only my minor in
[12:06] in the bachelors and then I had to
[12:08] choose basically what I'm going to focus
[12:10] on in uh in the Masters and then I
[12:12] focused on business and while I was in
[12:15] my bachelors I did all sorts of small
[12:18] jobs but then I also did an internship
[12:20] in in a bank RIS Bank very traditional
[12:24] bank but uh the third biggest or fourth
[12:27] fourth biggest Maybe Bank nationally in
[12:31] Switzerland it's also big in in in
[12:33] Austria yeah and
[12:37] um and then I stayed after the after the
[12:41] internship which was I think three
[12:43] months over the semester you know
[12:45] vacation period and then they wanted me
[12:47] to stay so I stayed part-time over the
[12:49] over over the course of a year and then
[12:51] finished my bachelor went to Australia
[12:53] traveling Etc so I stopped working at
[12:55] them not it was more an internship or
[12:58] like train ship than really working at
[13:00] the bank and it was also enough I I knew
[13:02] after that that I didn't want to go back
[13:04] to banking anymore but you experience a
[13:07] little bit of the the feat culture I
[13:09] guess uh back then and
[13:12] like when you compare the the fear
[13:15] culture and the Bitcoin culture in
[13:17] general uh maybe also in the background
[13:19] with the psychology like how different
[13:21] is the mindset of of like fat workers
[13:24] and Bitcoin workers do you see in
[13:26] difference when someone is understanding
[13:29] sound money system where versus someone
[13:31] is just not understanding sound money
[13:33] system they rather invest the money in
[13:36] the local feed currencies do you see the
[13:38] major difference now also as a CEO of a
[13:41] Bitcoin company where they are like
[13:44] probably only almost only Bitcoin is
[13:46] working there I don't know all the stuff
[13:48] but I guess there a lot of bitcoiners
[13:50] working at relay yeah yeah definitely uh
[13:53] so I think one big difference is the uh
[13:56] entrepreneurial mindsets that that
[13:59] bitcoiners have as opposed to a lot of
[14:01] people in the Fiat system I mean
[14:03] especially in banking right where they
[14:05] are at the source of the whole Fiat
[14:08] system the heart of the whole Fiat
[14:09] system and they are not there to
[14:12] innovate they are there to manage what
[14:15] is there save cost maybe increase
[14:18] efficiencies a little bit Max optimize
[14:21] some things mainly also politics it's
[14:23] mainly also about just having meetings
[14:25] and making sure that you you lick the
[14:28] right ass to get you know a bit above
[14:31] the ladder or you know you can get up
[14:34] the ladder of hierarchy um so it's
[14:38] definitely very different than in in
[14:40] Bitcoin where we want to build a new um
[14:43] Foundation right we want to build a new
[14:45] technology new protocol a new comes to
[14:48] bitcoin has this kind of revolutionary
[14:50] you know entrepreneurial Spirit wants to
[14:53] change the world to the better wants to
[14:55] you know do stuff out of passion out of
[14:57] purpose um um and people have a lot of
[15:01] Drive uh they come from Tech or from
[15:04] other fields also from marketing
[15:06] whatever and they want to contribute to
[15:08] making this happen this revolution
[15:11] whereas you know it's very different in
[15:13] the Fiat system in the banks they just
[15:15] want to get by they want to work 9 to5
[15:17] and ideally five to five past five they
[15:20] are at home and watching Netflix or
[15:23] whatever they they do in their free time
[15:26] um that's that's definitely a big um
[15:29] differentiate why why I also wanted to
[15:31] you know move into such an industry and
[15:34] not I I could not you know be around
[15:36] these people this was for me like living
[15:40] living death
[15:41] situation um also I think bitcoiners
[15:46] tend to question things much more uh the
[15:51] Fiat people most of these people I
[15:54] worked with in this bank they didn't
[15:56] understand money or the the Fiat
[15:59] Financial system and they also didn't
[16:00] really care to understand they
[16:02] understood their job what they need to
[16:04] do um and they understood a little bit
[16:07] of what they read in uh probably the
[16:10] text books of their um Financial
[16:12] education Etc but they didn't really
[16:16] question you know whether it makes sense
[16:18] or not to just have a central bank you
[16:21] know printing as much money as they want
[16:24] since we got off the gold standard in
[16:26] the 70s like and why we need to have
[16:29] inflation and interest rates that always
[16:31] change why we have uh why the US has a
[16:35] depth of like 34 trillion that they will
[16:38] never ever be able to even come close to
[16:41] paying back all these things that
[16:44] bitcoiners are just always challenging
[16:46] and questioning Fiat people or Bankers
[16:50] would would not necessarily do that they
[16:52] were just they are just a one part of a
[16:55] big machinery and they just work they do
[16:57] their stuff but they would never
[17:00] question and then last but not least I
[17:02] think they mostly are more shortterm
[17:06] oriented they have short-term
[17:08] perspectives um they want to make as
[17:11] much money as quickly as possible and
[17:14] then spend it for their pleasure um uh
[17:19] and and to get a better life Etc they
[17:22] all they all want to buy a house they
[17:24] want to buy uh a car they want to go on
[17:27] holidays they want to do these
[17:29] short-term pleasure like hedonistic
[17:31] lifestyle things whereas I think
[17:34] bitcoiners are much more about building
[17:37] and preserving wealth over
[17:40] generations and um making things that
[17:44] last like also foundational Financial
[17:47] system that lasts over Generations um
[17:51] they're not in it for the quick Buck um
[17:53] get rich quick Etc uh these kind of
[17:56] mindsets uh are are more prevalent more
[18:00] long-term in in bitcoiners I think so if
[18:04] if a Fiat or Banker would um build a
[18:08] house for example or an apartment
[18:11] whatever they would do it as quickly as
[18:13] possible as cheap as possible so that
[18:15] they can with a high profit rent it out
[18:18] and then that's that's their goal right
[18:20] but they will it would maybe break in 10
[18:22] or 20 years whereas I think if if a
[18:24] bitcoiner would build a house then uh he
[18:29] would try to make it last forever so
[18:32] that he could even um you know his
[18:35] children could inherit it and it could
[18:38] just last decades maybe even
[18:41] centuries these are maybe the three uh
[18:44] biggest um differences I would I would
[18:48] see did you have those uh mindsets also
[18:52] when you started really out or what what
[18:55] or questioning other other way around
[18:57] what did drive you to like found a
[18:59] company not work in a company being that
[19:03] entrepreneurial mind uh uh was it
[19:05] something that was founded in your
[19:06] company in your family I mean or did
[19:10] this came from where did this like Drive
[19:12] came to like start a company with like
[19:15] it takes a lot of Bravery I think also
[19:17] if like there was nothing there there
[19:19] was no proven concept they have a
[19:21] Bitcoin only uh thing in in Swiss uh
[19:24] like where did this came
[19:27] from I'm not sure I never really to the
[19:30] end analyzed or reflected this but uh I
[19:33] think it's not it's not really inherited
[19:36] for my family I think my mom and my dad
[19:38] both are not entrepreneurs my grandpa is
[19:41] actually an entrepreneur he founded his
[19:43] own uh company small uh Enterprise but
[19:48] otherwise it's not we we cannot I cannot
[19:50] say I come from a from a family that was
[19:54] necessarily entrepreneurial or wealthy
[19:57] or you know cared about money at all my
[20:00] mom was a bit of a hippie um and she's a
[20:02] pharmacist and my dad is a is a teacher
[20:07] English teacher and and plays music and
[20:10] is is an artist as well so but it's not
[20:13] like not it never it never really was
[20:15] about a lot of discussions about money
[20:17] or building businesses or whatever this
[20:20] this was never a topic at all um when I
[20:22] was a kid and first I also wanted to go
[20:25] into more social you know psychology Etc
[20:29] but I think it's a lot about just my
[20:31] personality and personalities are
[20:34] usually you you are kind of Born Into
[20:37] but also you are um you depending on the
[20:41] experiences that you make as as a child
[20:44] and growing up this this forms your
[20:46] personality and I just I think I'm a
[20:50] personality that wants to start things
[20:53] um I have drive I have ambition somehow
[20:56] I want to I can't just do to a 9 to-5
[20:59] job a lot of people out there they're
[21:01] very happy with these given structures
[21:04] being one small part in a big corporate
[21:06] organization everything is taken care of
[21:09] you know every the structure is clear
[21:11] they know exactly what to do every
[21:13] minute of their day and every day is
[21:14] exactly the same that's all fine I'm not
[21:17] saying that's bad um most of the people
[21:19] are like that but I'm I'm not like that
[21:22] I'm also not very good with authority so
[21:26] I was in the Army uh wasn't very good as
[21:29] a soldier I was better as an off I then
[21:31] made my way to an officer and so there
[21:33] it was it was okay because I at least I
[21:36] had some some more freedom than a
[21:38] soldier because as a soldier you're just
[21:40] you know just basically every minute of
[21:43] the day is just planned for you and just
[21:44] need you just need to function like a
[21:46] machine and I can't do that I need to be
[21:48] I I'm more creative I you know I want to
[21:51] drive things move things forward push
[21:53] things think out of the box um be
[21:55] Innovative start new things I get bored
[21:59] uh quickly so I want to always you know
[22:01] work on new things but also I want to
[22:03] see things through so I I want to work
[22:06] on something for years but but grow it I
[22:10] would not want to um continue on the
[22:13] same level for for years I always want
[22:15] to change I want more I want growth and
[22:17] blah blah so that kind of this
[22:20] entrepreneurial Drive probably I I had
[22:23] um already when I studied psychology
[22:25] Without Really knowing it I always had
[22:27] projects I started an
[22:30] association um then I I I did organize a
[22:34] lot of events um I I traveled a lot uh I
[22:39] I tried different things out always
[22:41] different sports Etc so I was always V I
[22:44] was always like that um then there was a
[22:47] seminar when I did my master's degree in
[22:50] Business there was everything was about
[22:53] corporate business in in Burn where I
[22:55] studied because this uh city is
[22:58] basically it's not like surich where uh
[23:01] there's a lot of startup things going on
[23:05] Burn is very traditional um very you
[23:07] know stable and basically the University
[23:11] of burn when it comes to business they
[23:13] prepare you for a corporate job because
[23:15] you have uh the the Swiss Post in Burn
[23:19] obviously the government the Swiss
[23:20] National Bank and uh you know couple
[23:23] couple of insurance oh the Swiss
[23:25] Railways they're all in burn so all
[23:28] these big boring corporate companies are
[23:31] there so that's also why the University
[23:33] of burn is basically preparing you for
[23:36] for this kind of boring job and that was
[23:39] not for me but there was one seminar
[23:41] that was called uh being an entrepreneur
[23:44] so this was basically about you know
[23:46] entrepreneurship startup Venture Capital
[23:48] Etc and this was really like blowing my
[23:51] mind this really inspired me to and I
[23:54] was like okay now finally I know what I
[23:56] want to do I want to be an R preneur I
[23:58] didn't know until then I was maybe 20 21
[24:00] until I had this um seminar and then I
[24:03] really knew okay that's what I want to
[24:05] be I want to be an entrepreneur I don't
[24:07] want to be a psychologist or whatever
[24:08] else I thought I want to be before um I
[24:11] want to I want to do this I want to
[24:13] start my compan I'm super excited to
[24:16] announce that this podcast just got the
[24:19] first ever sponsor I just started the

[24:58] amazing story and also like I had Adam
[25:01] on before and I also had ason on like
[25:05] two days ago I will have also IMO on I
[25:10] think in in in March like a month from
[25:12] now uh and someone else involved in in
[25:15] rela with uh the ego death Capital Jeff
[25:19] poof will come on on on Tuesday wow so
[25:23] so so will be a whole picture of of Rel
[25:26] and on the The Players around relay will
[25:28] be interesting to see maybe I make a
[25:30] compilation for
[25:32] Relay nice there are a couple of more
[25:34] right we are 22 fulltime employees now
[25:37] so you can go on everyone Benjamin would
[25:40] also be nice he can talk about relay
[25:43] private and real life business and like
[25:44] the highet oh that would be actually
[25:46] interesting yeah the guys that invest
[25:48] half a million or one million into
[25:50] Bitcoin this would also be interesting
[25:52] that would be really interesting because
[25:54] I come from my like feed chob that I
[25:57] still have uh kind of also what uh
[26:01] Benjamin uh does for reala just for I'm
[26:04] I'm selling not Bitcoin though uh in
[26:06] high volumes I'm selling it Security in
[26:08] high volumes uh it's it's completely
[26:11] different it's also like there's a lot
[26:12] of feared mindset going on in in in that
[26:15] world and that I probably is different
[26:18] when you're selling High ticket
[26:21] price High Bitcoin to high Networth
[26:25] individuals so that would be an
[26:26] interesting one I think
[26:28] um but what I wanted to ask is when when
[26:30] Adam was talking about the first three
[26:32] months is he was like in a situation
[26:35] where like I think his his his daughter
[26:37] was also born uh and a son son was born
[26:42] and you got I think was 15,000 or 12,000
[26:47] in in the starting for the for the first
[26:49] month something like that uh like how
[26:51] was the first three months and uh how
[26:54] did it progress further and was there
[26:57] ever moment where like oh this is
[26:59] not working
[27:00] out oh several moments so many moments
[27:03] where we thought this not it's never
[27:05] going to work um so really where it all
[27:08] started was I had the idea I think back
[27:12] in 2008 end of 2018 not even the idea
[27:15] but like the desire of hey we need
[27:17] something like that and I want to I
[27:19] wanted to have an app like that where
[27:22] you can you know it's easy for everyone
[27:24] to download and with a low amount you
[27:26] can buy Bitcoin you can set up savings
[27:28] plan that's what I was looking for for
[27:29] me because I hate complexity I'm not a
[27:31] tech guy I want to you know easy couple
[27:33] of clicks buy Bitcoin and I want to set
[27:35] up savings plan to automate but also for
[27:37] a lot of my friends or family who
[27:40] started to ask more about Bitcoin and
[27:42] wanted to have something that I can
[27:44] recommend them so I was looking for it
[27:46] didn't find it um let's say in Q4 uh
[27:51] 2018 and so q1 2019 then um we decided
[27:56] to uh okay let's put a group of people
[27:58] together and start working with that
[28:00] just purely as a hobby um and there Adam
[28:04] was already kind of involved but very
[28:06] low level um he he was participating in
[28:10] a couple of meetings but mainly was
[28:12] these two other people that I mentioned
[28:14] before who were more like the eth hats
[28:16] and also by the way Adam was still kind
[28:18] of eth and crypto in general back then
[28:21] and so so was I we were all like that
[28:23] we're not like Bitcoin Maxis yet um but
[28:27] we started it as a hobby a little bit
[28:29] and then in Q2 2019 we did the hackathon
[28:34] uh the biggest fintech hackathon
[28:35] actually in Europe was in zich so for
[28:38] three days for a whole weekend you get
[28:40] together with a small group of people
[28:42] and you work on an idea on a prototype
[28:45] on business model on Pitch Teck Etc and
[28:48] then you present it to a jury and um and
[28:51] you can win prices uh it's really fun
[28:53] and a lot of startups are being born out
[28:57] of the these hackathon situations and so
[28:59] was ours basically so we did that with
[29:02] these people so the two Eads and Adam
[29:05] and also one uh other um team member
[29:08] that we met spontaneously there and then
[29:11] we did that and we made it quite far
[29:15] like in the top 10 of these I don't know
[29:17] 50 60 teams that were there um and from
[29:20] there on you know we we we kept going so
[29:23] that was already the kind of that's
[29:26] where it kind of started but it was
[29:27] still like a hobby maybe in after that
[29:30] hackathon it was kind of a project but
[29:32] still we didn't think that we actually
[29:34] you know create a business out of it an
[29:36] actual product that would thousands of
[29:38] people would use um so it's kind of hard
[29:41] to say how the first months were going
[29:43] because this was the whole year of 2019
[29:45] was still this finding process where we
[29:48] worked a bit more on it than a bit less
[29:50] and all in our free time at nights at
[29:52] weekends because Adam still had his um
[29:56] software agency development agency that
[29:59] he was running so he was already an
[30:01] entrepreneur then and I still had uh to
[30:04] finish my um studies and I was working
[30:09] part-time at as a as a consultant 60% in
[30:13] Zurich so only beginning of like q1 2020
[30:18] uh we reckoned that okay we want to
[30:20] bring this live because we had an MVP
[30:23] that was working with a couple of test
[30:25] users we had a website we had social
[30:27] medias and we got some traction some
[30:30] first uh one or 200 people that were
[30:33] interested in that following us Etc uh
[30:36] and we had quite good user feedback so
[30:38] we thought okay we can now put this live
[30:41] and bring this life and bring it to the
[30:43] next level but we need some money for it
[30:45] and so these first three months that
[30:48] Adam was referring to was basically
[30:50] after we got some money and it was
[30:52] really 15K it's it's nothing but these
[30:55] 15K were supposed to to uh help us um
[30:59] within 3 months to bring it live to the
[31:01] app stores and that's what we did so I
[31:04] somehow raised it was really hard I
[31:06] talked to dozens of investors no one
[31:08] wanted to give us money because we were
[31:10] very I was very inexperienced I I had
[31:13] never created a business I had never
[31:15] raised money I didn't know who to talk
[31:17] to and how but somehow then from two
[31:20] people we got uh 10K and 5K so 15K uh we
[31:25] didn't have a company we didn't really
[31:27] have a right a real contract it's more
[31:29] like a one pager that we signed that
[31:30] okay if this is going anywhere uh then
[31:33] you guys will get a percentage of the
[31:36] company for this money that's it and
[31:39] then we did get the money on our private
[31:41] bank accounts we didn't have anything
[31:43] and then from that we paid basically
[31:45] Adam uh 5K a month for three month so
[31:48] that he could fully focus on that I was
[31:51] still working part-time and then April
[31:54] May June we or mainly who's going all in
[31:58] uh from our MVP that we
[32:00] have creating the apps on IOS and
[32:04] Android and then in I think first or
[32:07] second of
[32:09] July one day after his son was also born
[32:12] we went live with the app we published
[32:14] it on the app stores and that's also the
[32:17] that was also the first day I was um I
[32:19] was out of my full-time job so I also
[32:21] quit my full-time job uh part-time job I
[32:24] mean and then from there I was all in to
[32:26] bit from from to relay so from June 2020
[32:31] I was all in relay and so was Adam but
[32:35] we were broke again because we had
[32:37] burned through the the 15K right and we
[32:40] both didn't have a lot of money uh
[32:42] individually back then so yeah that's
[32:44] that that was kind of the the story and
[32:47] um there were a lot of moments in these
[32:50] three months but also before and many
[32:52] many many afterward where we thought
[32:55] yeah this this is the end it's not going
[32:57] to it's not going to go anywhere but
[33:00] somehow we just always resisted to
[33:02] giving up that I think that's the the
[33:04] main thing like when you uh see people
[33:07] that are succeeding they fail so many
[33:09] times and just like they just kept
[33:11] trying to do stuff and obviously like
[33:13] you're really young to be successful and
[33:16] have a company with with 20 employees
[33:18] and uh this would be also interesting to
[33:21] talk about I think you have it also in
[33:22] your PIN tweet like now from the
[33:26] starting pH SP where you are you and
[33:28] Adam and you started out and you
[33:30] basically have no experience no money
[33:33] and it's just an idea that kind of
[33:35] catched on uh to like fast forward a few
[33:38] years later now you secured like a next
[33:41] funding uh from uh I think it was led by
[33:44] Jeff poof and ego def Capital uh and but
[33:48] there were like four or five other uh
[33:51] funds involved um where's really like
[33:54] right now and where do where does really
[33:56] want to to go like in the next next five
[33:59] years mhm yeah so from these humble
[34:03] beginnings where you know we had this uh
[34:06] period of where we didn't we didn't have
[34:09] any money so we couldn't really pay
[34:11] ourselves we could not pay for anything
[34:14] um so we had this period where we were
[34:16] then starting to uh raise money so we
[34:19] knew that okay we we need if this should
[34:22] work and if this should go from a hobby
[34:25] which it was in 20 19 to a project where
[34:29] it was in 20 uh 20 if it really should
[34:32] become a company and the full-time job
[34:35] for us in
[34:36] 2021 forward then we need to raise money
[34:39] and we need to keep raising money uh so
[34:42] we can grow Etc and so then I took this
[34:45] job basically on of being the fundraiser
[34:48] and I knew from there on one part of my
[34:51] time part time I would always be
[34:53] fundraising and talking to investors and
[34:56] selling company to the outside world Etc
[34:59] U so that Adam also could focus really
[35:01] on the building and uh improving and
[35:04] developing further developing um the
[35:06] project and produ product uh
[35:09] mostly um so uh now how we how we got
[35:14] here was I think that we made a couple
[35:18] of right decisions we made a lot of
[35:19] mistakes but also learned from that but
[35:21] we made a couple of good decisions and
[35:25] uh were able to build a culture that uh
[35:29] really um um appeals to users followers
[35:35] referers uh influencers ambassadors
[35:39] investors uh Partners um and and
[35:42] everything in between so the kind of a
[35:45] brand and a culture and the value set
[35:47] that kind of attracts great talents good
[35:50] investors uh and all that and really
[35:53] this mindset of you know never giving up
[35:57] always trying to become 1% better every
[36:00] day um not accept mediocracy always
[36:04] going for the next level always trying
[36:06] to think out of the box how can we make
[36:08] things differently and better um really
[36:11] with this desire of bringing Bitcoin to
[36:13] more people because we truly believe
[36:15] that Bitcoin is the best uh savings
[36:17] technology and the best money that human
[36:20] beings have ever created and we really
[36:22] all of all of us Rel layers want to
[36:25] bring more bit to more people um and so
[36:29] this helped us to uh always um even if
[36:33] the times were hard always endure and
[36:35] never give up and always keep going and
[36:37] just make the next step achieve the next
[36:40] Milestone um and and move on so it was
[36:44] never a linear uh development in these
[36:47] last three and a half years that we were
[36:49] on a market almost three and a half
[36:51] almost four um and it will also not be
[36:55] linear in the next next couple of years
[36:58] that's that's for sure but what's also
[37:00] for sure is that we will never give up
[37:01] and we always uh we always continue I
[37:05] think the success factors is is pretty
[37:07] much that and um yeah it's uh even
[37:10] though we have great investors now like
[37:12] Jeff Boo and EOD or Alex man from time
[37:16] chain or Mike jots with lightning
[37:19] Ventures and O mikowski with Fulgore
[37:22] Ventures so a lot of great Bitcoin only
[37:25] funds but also some other funds like
[37:28] cait Capital they're more crypto uh fund
[37:33] but also really understood the Bitcoin
[37:35] only narrative and red Alpine which is
[37:37] one of the biggest VC funds in in
[37:40] Switzerland and also in Europe um and
[37:42] there are General VC they invest in
[37:44] everything between mettech futte fintech
[37:47] Bitcoin crypto whatever
[37:50] everything um but it was definitely not
[37:53] easy and it was also never like okay the
[37:56] next round is bigger and the next round
[37:58] is bigger and the next round is bigger
[38:00] and in in the end it looks like a
[38:02] success story but in between there's a
[38:03] lot of ups and downs always and uh there
[38:06] were things that we didn't necessar that
[38:09] was didn't was not necessarily great
[38:13] considered great success um also in
[38:15] fundraising we sometimes thought okay we
[38:18] could have raised more at a higher
[38:20] valuation and we have lost a lot of uh
[38:23] investor negotiations or discussions uh
[38:26] so it's not that we can always just say
[38:28] okay next investor next we want you we
[38:31] want you no it's always super hard even
[38:34] though we are now um you know very close
[38:37] to profitability making great revenues
[38:40] we have 300,000 updown loads 100,000
[38:43] active users um you know 30 plus million
[38:48] monthly uh trading volume so more than a
[38:50] million a day it's really like it's
[38:53] these are great numbers we're growing
[38:54] fast Etc still it's very hard for us to
[38:57] fundraise it's always it's always hard
[39:00] from the outside it always looks easy
[39:02] but it's always much much harder and I'm
[39:04] sure the same will will apply for the
[39:07] next couple of years but to answer your
[39:09] question of what where I see relay going
[39:12] um I think we really can we really have
[39:16] the potential with what we have the
[39:18] foundations we have built so far that in
[39:21] the next let's say three to five years
[39:23] we can go public uh in in in
[39:27] Switzerland I think we can grow uh much
[39:31] faster I really believe that the the
[39:33] more we grow the more we grow it has
[39:35] been like that the last three years uh
[39:38] that we grew um several 100% every year
[39:41] and if that continues and I think it
[39:43] will continue then we will be at a size
[39:47] in like two to three years where we can
[39:49] go public where we can um be traded on
[39:53] on on a stock market and where we can
[39:56] also start making Acquisitions where we
[39:58] can also start growing um Beyond Europe
[40:02] as well where we can have different like
[40:05] expanding in terms of different
[40:07] customers which we've already started so
[40:09] from retail to affluence to now also
[40:11] private customers to also business
[40:14] customers hopefully later as well
[40:16] corporate customers Etc all with the
[40:20] idea of bringing more Fiat money and
[40:23] more people into Bitcoin right but then
[40:25] also expand in in other geographies and
[40:28] also expand in different products so
[40:31] which we've also started so we have the
[40:33] the relay app which is a Bitcoin onchain
[40:36] wallet and brokerage um soon it will
[40:39] also be a lightning wallet so onchain
[40:42] wallet and lightning wallet um with
[40:45] different more features and relay
[40:47] private which
[40:49] is service an OTC advisory service that
[40:53] also caters to many more needs of these
[40:56] privat clients High Network individuals
[40:58] and businesses in the future and so
[41:01] these are the three expansion uh
[41:03] categories that we see and that we just
[41:05] basically based on the feedback of our
[41:07] users
[41:09] will um will just you know expand and
[41:12] further develop whatever they are asking
[41:15] and um I think if we do such a good job
[41:19] as we did the last three and a half
[41:21] years and also in the next three years
[41:23] especially because the market will also
[41:25] become better now that DS are out the
[41:27] haling is coming Etc I think we are on
[41:31] on the brink of major bull market again
[41:33] in Bitcoin um and we will catch uh
[41:36] capture a lot of this growth and uh
[41:38] we'll grow to to much bigger company
[41:41] that probably we cannot even imagine uh
[41:44] at this point now and will be you know
[41:46] publicly traded and also start doing
[41:48] Acquisitions Etc and hopefully be a bit
[41:51] of a competitor to the big shitcoin
[41:53] casinos like coinbase binance bit fund
[41:55] ET
[41:57] that's I think it's just an amazing
[41:59] story and as you said with the ups and
[42:01] downs it's it's similar to it I compared
[42:05] it in my head with like the Bitcoin
[42:07] price itself like the Bitcoin story
[42:08] itself because when you look back the
[42:10] last like 15 years they like no brainer
[42:13] I invest there and it goes up like crazy
[42:16] percentages uh but when you're actually
[42:18] in holding Bitcoin and you see it going
[42:21] up and down and crashing 90% going up uh
[42:24] 5x uh like is a crazy uh huddling
[42:28] experience for everybody that's is in
[42:30] there for like more than 5 10 years
[42:32] especially it's like experience those
[42:35] highs and lows uh and like going up and
[42:39] thinking you're the best and then being
[42:40] humbled the next time with 80% down it's
[42:43] like this is experience I guess it's a
[42:46] similar experience I don't know but it's
[42:48] I guess it's similar to like founding a
[42:51] company and going through this wow we
[42:53] amazing we are so great we are doing the
[42:55] best we Conquering the world and next
[42:57] month it's like oh we're going
[42:59] bankrupt I don't know if if it's like
[43:02] kind of that but I I can imagine it's
[43:04] it's kind of like that feeling it's
[43:07] exactly that and it's exactly like we
[43:09] have been in several situations where we
[43:13] thought we need to give up um where we
[43:15] thought we need to look for another job
[43:17] because we could not pay ourselves where
[43:19] we were at the brink of bankruptcy where
[43:21] we thought that maybe we need to um we
[43:25] need to lay of half of our staff you
[43:27] know we were fortunately never we never
[43:31] had to do things like that so far we
[43:33] always found another way another
[43:35] solution and I think that's also our
[43:37] strength that we doesn't matter what
[43:39] happens we will always find a solution
[43:41] somehow that's our strong culture that
[43:44] we have built that's the with the team
[43:46] and the situation we are in now
[43:47] everything can happen and we will solve
[43:50] every problem uh that's that's the big
[43:52] asset we have but there will always be
[43:54] such situation there have in many of
[43:56] these situations um that are probably
[43:59] that were much more severe than um
[44:02] probably anyone from the outside can
[44:04] imagine because and and also I couldn't
[44:07] imagine to be in these stressful
[44:09] situations you know with several nights
[44:12] of um Sleepless uh sweating and
[44:16] Nightmares uh yeah but that's just part
[44:18] of the story and I think coming back to
[44:20] why would anyone do this why am I doing
[44:23] this uh you need to be a kind of
[44:26] personality that kind of likes that
[44:28] going up and down and that would get
[44:31] bored with um continuous you know happy
[44:35] uh um you know just a situation that
[44:39] always is the same but just continues
[44:41] and happy and bit boring but fine um but
[44:45] satisfied no I I'm a person that can
[44:48] never really be satisfied I always want
[44:49] more and I like these challenges and
[44:51] dramas Etc that come when you just build
[44:54] a startup out of nothing in such young
[44:56] industry as well and I think most of our
[45:00] um my co-founder for sure Adam and also
[45:03] most of our employees are like that um
[45:06] and I think you need to be a little bit
[45:08] almost born for this and bad things that
[45:13] come with it yeah I mean I can confirm
[45:16] with the three people I talked like four
[45:18] people I actually talked to like with
[45:20] IMO with you with Adam and with arson
[45:22] and we'll talk to more of the relay team
[45:25] it's it's it's an amazing culture you
[45:28] you see that uh spirit in in the
[45:31] conversations on Twitter in in the
[45:33] pictures when you see the real Summit I
[45:36] think you're also coming to Vienna I
[45:37] think in April uh will'll be really
[45:39] close uh to me and lince also cool we
[45:42] should meet we should meet for a coffee
[45:44] yeah definitely I'm actually moving to
[45:46] Vienna in in
[45:49] June so um I will be like two months
[45:52] later my home will be in in in in Vienna
[45:55] but 10th of April yeah come back coming
[45:59] back to reala and sometimes think about
[46:02] that I mean there always stuff to do but
[46:05] when you when you see real and other
[46:08] Bitcoin only exchanges they're like kind
[46:09] of the bridge from the feed world to the
[46:12] Bitcoin World they are taking fear from
[46:15] people and giving them Bitcoin back uh
[46:18] in in the most simplest
[46:20] terms uh so what what happens once
[46:25] people don't accept feed anymore because
[46:27] uh nobody wants feed anymore it's like I
[46:30] guess it's it's a far out future will be
[46:33] like I think there are tens of years
[46:36] where like fear is still a thing there
[46:39] are other people that say like five
[46:40] years and fear is De there other people
[46:42] like 100 years will live on for sure
[46:45] there are other people that will live on
[46:46] forever but if you imagine uh there are
[46:50] more and more people coming on Rel more
[46:51] and more people switching to a Bitcoin
[46:53] standard if you just think that thought
[46:56] through more there will come a point
[46:58] where fear is so small or just does not
[47:01] exist anymore uh what do you imagine I
[47:04] mean it's really far ahead but what do
[47:05] you imagine Rel will do in such a a
[47:08] Bitcoin standard
[47:11] world I think then um the question
[47:15] becomes what is what is really your
[47:17] purpose as a company because if your
[47:21] purpose as a company is only like very
[47:22] transactional and focus on one product
[47:26] then yeah once this um
[47:30] Innovation uh development has happened
[47:32] and the adoption of this product or
[47:35] technology has happened then you don't
[47:36] have a mission anymore and you die but
[47:39] if you H if you as a company have an an
[47:43] overarching mission that goes a bit
[47:45] higher than just delivering a product to
[47:47] people um then you become a lasting
[47:51] great company that will ever grow and
[47:54] ever be uh dominant and do good change
[47:57] in the in the world as well be very
[47:59] profitable so and I hope Relay can
[48:02] become this um so when all the Fiat in
[48:06] the world has been exchanged to bitcoin
[48:09] which by the way is 5600 trillion Fiat
[48:13] money uh in the world so that's a lot of
[48:16] exchange and a lot of transaction um
[48:19] commissions as well for for us
[48:21] to a lot of transaction fees here as I
[48:24] see a big re
[48:26] big profits to make that's great um but
[48:30] but even then um and I'm I'm with you or
[48:33] I'm the opinion that this will take
[48:35] decades uh this will not take five years
[48:38] will take several decades so in my
[48:40] lifetime let's say already that just
[48:43] exchanging Fiat to bitcoin I think is
[48:45] one of the best business models and um I
[48:48] think I will um until I get you know my
[48:51] my pension in 35 years I think that's
[48:56] that's going to be the main uh thing we
[48:58] do but also in comparing to other
[49:02] companies maybe that have the same
[49:04] problem um they have the great ones have
[49:09] figured out a way of serving uh the PE
[49:14] serving people um with the different uh
[49:18] Innovation and Technology phases um and
[49:21] and always also be adapting themselves
[49:23] so let's take Apple for example
[49:26] they started in the what was it 70s
[49:28] maybe 80s and they basically with with
[49:32] the mission of bringing personal
[49:33] computers to everyone now you know in in
[49:38] the 2000s maybe 20 30 years later pretty
[49:41] much everyone had a had a personal
[49:43] computer be a Macintosh or a or a
[49:45] Windows PC whatever but um personal
[49:49] computers have become a thing even
[49:51] though in the 80s no one would thought
[49:53] would think that's going to be a thing
[49:55] but then
[49:56] 2010 maybe I would say most of the
[49:58] households had um personal computer then
[50:01] you could say okay they just Apple goes
[50:03] out of business because that that was it
[50:05] right the the mission is complete but no
[50:07] then what they did is they also um
[50:10] created other gadgets that were uh in in
[50:14] on the internet and helping the people
[50:16] living better lives like um the iPod the
[50:20] iPhone then came the watch the the Apple
[50:23] watch now they are building the vision
[50:25] Pro uh virtual reality thing um they are
[50:29] also coming out with an electric car
[50:31] self-driving car by 2028 um they had the
[50:35] TV the Apple TV the airpods you know
[50:38] whatever whatever you can think of they
[50:40] have they have built um always with just
[50:44] the the overarching vision mission
[50:46] desire of you know making using
[50:49] technology and making the people's life
[50:52] better with this
[50:53] technology another uh maybe good example
[50:56] is Netflix so Netflix started with um
[51:00] just as a as a as a um DVD uh company so
[51:05] you can rent DVDs Etc and then when DVDs
[51:08] was not a thing anymore they switched to
[51:10] being becoming a streaming um service
[51:14] like they are now and they will always
[51:16] be switching just around um the the
[51:19] vision that they have of bringing great
[51:21] entertainment to people so their Vision
[51:24] was not or their mission was not not
[51:25] bringing DVDs to people like this was
[51:28] the product but when society and
[51:31] Technologies changed they also changed
[51:34] and so they had an
[51:35] overarching um vision and still have to
[51:39] bring great entertainment to people and
[51:42] independent of the products and
[51:43] Innovations Etc so coming back to relay
[51:46] I hope we are building the foundations
[51:48] for this company to last decades or even
[51:52] uh centuries because we don't
[51:55] necessarily bring Bitcoin to people or
[51:58] help people to exchange their dirty Fiat
[52:00] to sound money to bitcoin but maybe our
[52:04] overarching vision and that's not you
[52:06] know after three and a half years maybe
[52:08] we haven't really found yet the right uh
[52:11] uh Vision but it's maybe more to help
[52:14] people save their hard-earned
[52:18] money and keep it somewhere where the
[52:21] purchasing power you know stays and
[52:24] serve their future selves and also the
[52:28] Futures future
[52:30] Generations um to handle their personal
[52:33] finances whatever this will be maybe now
[52:35] it's Fiat money and I mean now it's it's
[52:38] becoming Bitcoin but then maybe in 100
[52:40] years is something else um so that's I
[52:43] think what in we're in the process of
[52:45] finding our big overarching goal and
[52:48] vision that will um also endure um these
[52:53] maybe even the hyperbitcoinization phase
[52:55] Etc that's a I think it's an amazing
[52:58] answer especially with with the Apple
[53:00] example and when you see what are they
[53:02] doing what what they started doing and
[53:04] what they're now doing um we're coming
[53:07] to the to the end of the podcast uh
[53:09] where we have
[53:12] an get the previous guest is asking a
[53:14] question for like the next guest and
[53:17] there's like this question and I have an
[53:19] and substitute question for that if if
[53:21] this an is this this an interesting
[53:23] question um
[53:25] he said I don't remember the exact word
[53:28] he said what Bitcoin is but if Bitcoin
[53:31] is kind of a converter where like
[53:33] you throw stuff in it and something nice
[53:36] comes out the other way uh what's the
[53:39] thing that comes out the other way who
[53:41] is that I am from questioning Bitcoin uh
[53:45] the rabbit hole story uh host one of the
[53:48] rabbit hole story I think the the
[53:50] co-host is even working at Rel right Jay
[53:53] uh from yeah true yeah I don't I I don't
[53:58] know if I understand the question right
[53:59] so if Bitcoin would be this
[54:03] converter
[54:05] con sh conter yeah like you throw
[54:08] at it in on one side and then what comes
[54:11] out on set cold making making to
[54:16] cold yeah I don't know because Fiat is
[54:19] basically and Bitcoin is gold or
[54:23] you know make just making something
[54:27] valuable out of something that is not
[54:29] valuable that's in my mind I have this
[54:32] machine I don't know how it exactly
[54:34] looks like and then uh someone is
[54:36] shoveling in in the first you know
[54:39] on the left side and on the right side
[54:41] just gold comes out of it yeah this this
[54:44] question are getting out of out of hand
[54:46] I think I have to like randomize the
[54:49] questions uh because Asen uh I think the
[54:52] social media leader relay uh he was
[54:55] asking oh who's the next guest and he
[54:58] and I said to him yeah it's Ian and he
[55:00] said like oh ask him how is it to be
[55:02] bold so I think I have to stop revealing
[55:05] who's the next guest
[55:06] is yeah yeah that that might help but in
[55:10] the case of arson I think whatever it
[55:12] would be a it would have been a strange
[55:15] and shitty and funny question independ
[55:19] next yes he's a funny guy AR is a very
[55:22] funny guy yeah he's he's a lot of fun I
[55:24] think it's talked with him even after
[55:26] the podcast over an hour so like he he
[55:28] was really fun to talk to yeah yeah then
