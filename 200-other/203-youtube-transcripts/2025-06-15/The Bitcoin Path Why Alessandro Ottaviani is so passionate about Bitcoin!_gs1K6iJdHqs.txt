[00:00] welcome my friend to the Bitcoin path
[00:02] where we uncover the transformative
[00:05] Journeys bitcoiners go through and their
[00:07] amazing insights they can share the
[00:10] following is a conversation with
[00:11] alesandro ovani he studied Bitcoin for
[00:15] hundreds of hours or maybe even
[00:17] thousands deeply educated and truly
[00:20] humbl did alesandro ovani also create
[00:24] hours of lectures on YouTube about
[00:27] Austrian economics sound money and biton
[00:30] education in general it was a great
[00:32] pleasure talking with him and I hope you
[00:34] enjoy Also listening to a completely
[00:37] underrated Bitcoin mind hello alesandro
[00:40] hi
[00:41] doin so uh you are as I saw from my
[00:45] research really focused on bitcoin uh
[00:48] you have hours on hours of videos on
[00:52] YouTube with Austrian economics lectures
[00:54] with the history of money with General
[00:56] Bitcoin education you have thousands of
[00:59] posts also on on X uh on you have a
[01:01] community on Facebook you have articles
[01:04] on medium you you will also share one of
[01:07] the Articles of the medium uh in the in
[01:10] the end with us why Bitcoin and my
[01:14] question would be not why Bitcoin but
[01:17] why are you so passionate about Bitcoin
[01:20] why are you doing the extra work the
[01:22] extra mile and not only learning about
[01:25] sound money but also talking and
[01:28] educating other people about sound
[01:31] money yes good good question good first
[01:34] question and I think it's part of the
[01:37] Bitcoin Journey uh first three you see
[01:40] Bitcoin at the beginning your skeptical
[01:42] then you go down in the rabbit hole as
[01:45] we say in the Bitcoin world and once you
[01:48] reach a certain level you understand the
[01:50] importance of Bitcoin then it become
[01:53] normal that you want to talk about
[01:54] Bitcoin and you want to reach also more
[01:57] audience and that is why and I had um I
[02:02] try to put post daily in ex with my my
[02:08] insights of how it's going in Bitcoin or
[02:11] educational videos in YouTube and
[02:13] article in medium I think it's part of
[02:16] the Bitcoin Journey oh great and was
[02:19] there something because you right now if
[02:22] I'm correct
[02:23] 38 yes correct and so you had a live
[02:28] before Bitcoin that you already remember
[02:31] quite nicely so when uh Bitcoin was
[02:33] created you were what 22 23 something
[02:37] like I I turned just turned one month
[02:39] ago 39 so till the day before I turned
[02:42] 39 I was saying 38 now I can should say
[02:45] 39 in 20 I think we should consider the
[02:49] third of January right not the end of
[02:51] October when they third of January I
[02:54] also consider the first uh date of of
[02:56] Bitcoin so 2009 I was 24 years old I was
[03:01] uh I finished I just was finishing
[03:02] University and starting um to work I was
[03:06] waiting uh look for the first job so yes
[03:09] it was a long time ago would you uh so
[03:12] for example 24 it was uh created but it
[03:16] was not not really there like it needed
[03:19] a long time to catch on when you were
[03:22] let's say 22 there was no Bitcoin at all
[03:25] um if you were 22 and Bitcoin was
[03:28] already uh like say let's say 10 years
[03:30] old 14 years old um would you have been
[03:34] in the right mindset at that young age
[03:37] to be ready for Bitcoin was there like
[03:40] did you already had money on your mind
[03:43] did you had already this this kind of
[03:46] mindset to to to critical think and
[03:49] research about that stuff at this age I
[03:52] don't think so uh that's why I think the
[03:55] best age uh where a person can be really
[03:58] interested in Bitcoin is during the 30
[04:01] years when he has finished university
[04:03] has some experience at work and uh he
[04:07] start also to look about savings where
[04:09] to invest and it will be more
[04:11] interesting topics about Bitcoin I see
[04:14] in case I was in the 20s as many other
[04:17] in the 20s now in case I would be
[04:19] interested in the technology will be
[04:21] more in Bitcoin and crypto uh I found
[04:24] more normal if someone who is 23 24 is
[04:27] more fascinated by the technology of
[04:29] crypto
[04:30] but when you are in the 30s you have
[04:33] started to have a say a good amount of
[04:36] savings and uh then you start to reflect
[04:38] where should I put the savings and then
[04:41] uh start the learning for sure maybe I
[04:43] would have been interested in Bitcoin
[04:45] but not at the level I will be in my 30s
[04:48] I what what would be your thought on
[04:52] this I also think so I mean I'm quite
[04:55] young I'm 24 right now so I discovered
[04:58] Bitcoin uh uh what say three years ago
[05:01] like with 21 and I went went all in when
[05:05] I was 2020 so with with 22 years old I
[05:09] was completely all in in Bitcoin and
[05:13] have been now ever since oh I'm actually
[05:16] also 25 forgot that my my my my birthday
[05:21] but is already a few months back so I'm
[05:25] 25 25 and so Bitcoin has been uh I've
[05:31] been investing in stocks before I've
[05:33] been investing in uh different kinds of
[05:37] ETFs and funds about uh before Bitcoin
[05:42] and this is how I saw Bitcoin then and
[05:48] for me once I understood it was really
[05:50] clear that it's Bitcoin and Bitcoin only
[05:52] I had a small shitcoin phase yes it was
[05:56] really fast the case where I was like it
[05:59] it's only Bitcoin for me and I always
[06:02] find it very interesting to see when was
[06:05] this moment in a person's life and what
[06:08] changed uh on this Bitcoin path um and
[06:13] maybe maybe you can share when you first
[06:16] encounter Bitcoin when you first had the
[06:18] moment oh Bitcoin is the thing I
[06:21] actually want to focus in really heavily
[06:24] and maybe what what changed in your mind
[06:26] or what what drove you to this decision
[06:30] okay yes firstly congrats there are not
[06:32] many people as young as you full in
[06:35] Bitcoin another is Dyan lir is also 23
[06:39] if you see most of the people who are
[06:41] promoting or only Bitcoin is under like
[06:45] above 30s so Congress to have reached
[06:47] this Bitcoin stage all Bitcoin only
[06:50] stage and I also I think every bitcoiner
[06:53] has also a shitcoin face it was I I
[06:56] always say there is Bitcoin then Bitcoin
[06:59] and Al coin then a time where you have I
[07:01] was also thinking web 3 blockchain
[07:04] metaverse and so on then you start to
[07:06] think okay this no this no this no then
[07:09] remain Bitcoin and something else and
[07:12] then it's like you know what all the
[07:13] rest could be a scam or the utility is
[07:17] very very limited versus Bitcoin so it
[07:20] makes the only thing it makes sense is
[07:21] just focus on bitcoin so Congress to
[07:24] have reached this phase so early for me
[07:27] the first encounter was in 2017 when I
[07:30] was uh it as most of the as most of the
[07:34] people I was interested because the
[07:35] price was going up and that is also why
[07:38] I think not many other bitcoiners are so
[07:40] focused on this but for me that the
[07:42] price is going up is very important to
[07:44] have new joiners because being and
[07:47] joining Bitcoin is most of the people
[07:49] are not doing for Freedom censorship
[07:51] resistance Austrian School of Economics
[07:55] or the economic World they are
[07:56] interested because the price is going up
[07:59] and they will be the best argument to
[08:02] convince a person at least getting
[08:04] interested and uh so I joined in 2017 I
[08:08] did small profit as always in the first
[08:11] it was just a small portion of my
[08:13] portfolio then there was the crash as
[08:15] you know in
[08:17] 2018 and uh I was h i was for one and a
[08:21] half two years I was not interested
[08:24] anymore checking every now and then how
[08:26] he was doing but not more and then as
[08:30] you uh in 2020 I became also more
[08:32] interested also because one thing the
[08:34] price was coming up again while many
[08:38] other people was declaring dead they say
[08:40] okay but then is not dead so maybe this
[08:42] is some value and second also Co came so
[08:45] it free up also more free time because
[08:49] we could not have done many things that
[08:51] otherwise we do so I Ed portion of the
[08:54] time to start learn about Bitcoin the
[08:57] book of saf um
[09:00] also Michael following Michael saor the
[09:03] nine the first interviews between
[09:05] Michael saor and breed love and then he
[09:08] start with X all the other podcasts so
[09:11] it was I can say from middle of 2020 and
[09:15] from end 2020 I'm regularly follow
[09:17] following bitcoin news
[09:21] daily did and did something uh change
[09:24] when you went into Bitcoin uh in your
[09:28] Maybe or career life was was there some
[09:32] I don't know principles you learned with
[09:35] Bitcoin you then adapted into your uh
[09:39] life without Bitcoin yes yes no in fact
[09:42] they say you don't change Bitcoin but
[09:45] Bitcoins change you and it is a path so
[09:49] it takes one or two years in fact I
[09:51] always recommend people to study Bitcoin
[09:53] 250 hours and staying in Bitcoin they
[09:56] have to hear podcast information for at
[09:58] least two years before they really think
[10:01] okay that's the thing and uh very
[10:04] important is Bitcoin is also economics
[10:07] so sociology and learning about the
[10:09] Austrian School of Economics I evaluate
[10:12] much more how Economics work and is the
[10:16] Human Action um how is the how we Define
[10:21] value and how important is our time and
[10:24] I think the most important thing the
[10:26] value then the economic economics is all
[10:28] about scarcity and scarcity is about the
[10:31] scarcity of our human time and we have
[10:34] to be very careful on how we use our
[10:39] time that is the only limited resource
[10:42] and obviously you are more interested in
[10:45] the future so you will also save more so
[10:49] what is maybe could be have been before
[10:51] luxury you still have a I still have a
[10:54] um for sure conduct a good life with a
[10:56] vacation dinner and so on but I keep an
[10:58] eye that I save every month because this
[11:02] is important for my future so it's even
[11:05] more that's a great learning that the
[11:08] the more minimal and the more um you
[11:11] value the money more because your time
[11:14] preference just lowers and this is a
[11:16] great learning I I I see it with every
[11:18] bitcoiner I never talked with a
[11:21] bitcoiner that had a high time
[11:23] preference yeah yes it's uh and it's
[11:27] also more important on the maybe the
[11:29] experience I still value experience like
[11:31] investing money in time for holidays
[11:34] it's a good thing but uh on luxury goods
[11:39] on just things that will decrease the
[11:41] value um is not in fact when I see a 30
[11:45] years old 32 years old guy who has a car
[11:48] who cost 60 80,000 I think the first
[11:50] thing will be oh you need to learn about
[11:53] economic yes um let's I I want to go
[11:59] back to um uh 20 yearold because you
[12:03] said in the beginning that it's really
[12:06] hard for people in their 20s to focus
[12:08] solely on
[12:09] bitcoin um because they're distracted
[12:12] they have they are more interested in
[12:14] crypto and it's only late in life when
[12:16] they know the value of saving when they
[12:19] know uh when they have more life
[12:21] experience when they have more uh work
[12:23] experience that they got get to that
[12:25] Bitcoin only stage and I totally agree
[12:27] with you here um if you go to any um
[12:31] real world meetups you mostly see 30
[12:35] year or older guys there yes um but how
[12:40] can you as a Bitcoin Bitcoin educator um
[12:45] maybe let's maybe imagine a young person
[12:48] in their mid 20s they never heard about
[12:50] Bitcoin they have little to known
[12:52] knowledge about um money and the history
[12:55] of money and sound money and the austan
[12:57] economics how do you raise the vess for
[13:00] them in Bitcoin why should they even
[13:03] care in their their young stage about
[13:07] Bitcoin or should they care about
[13:09] Bitcoin how would you explain it to
[13:12] them yes they they should uh um they
[13:15] should everyone should pay pay attention
[13:18] to bitcoin I see if I discuss with 50
[13:22] people from uh who are more than 30
[13:25] maybe the percentage of people who will
[13:27] be interested in Bitcoin will be higher
[13:31] than if I ask if I talk with 50 people
[13:34] or 100 people of who are 20 how I would
[13:37] address maybe more on the
[13:39] technology and because probably if you
[13:42] are 20 you are studying engineering as I
[13:44] studied you are also interested in the
[13:46] technology and then as always we should
[13:48] discuss about what is money what how
[13:51] money comes U how where money comes from
[13:56] and also what is helping now is that to
[13:59] have that we have high inflation in the
[14:02] last two years this is a a great
[14:04] narrative so I will also approach like
[14:05] this uh we don't that first it should be
[14:08] clear that inflation is coming from
[14:10] printing printing money and second that
[14:14] the system is broken is easier to see
[14:17] now than maybe three years ago because
[14:19] with the inflation of one or 2% unless
[14:22] you really deep dive on Austrian School
[14:25] of Economics is hard to grasp now people
[14:28] are seeing that inflation is a big hit
[14:31] so I will connect this inflation with
[14:34] the economic system that is
[14:36] broken for me the next question is
[14:39] totally clear but I get this question a
[14:40] lot so why is printing money actually
[14:45] causing inflation um and especially when
[14:49] people seeing Oh there's a lot of money
[14:51] printing there's covid but then the
[14:53] inflation only Rises a little afterwards
[14:56] and then you hear in the news oh we have
[14:59] War there we have this pandemic there
[15:01] and um when when you ask most people
[15:05] about um where is inflation coming from
[15:08] they are actually all telling you uh
[15:12] like most people uh oh it's because of
[15:14] War oh
[15:17] Supply you have you hear a lot of
[15:20] reasons that are not false but they are
[15:23] not the real reason that this is just
[15:25] symptoms so in fact I say yeah got it a
[15:29] very good point I so um yes it's true
[15:33] that it was coming also from the war for
[15:35] the energy price and some some topics
[15:37] some inflation for specific goods or
[15:41] services can be is also for the supply
[15:43] but overall
[15:44] inflation should uh it cannot come from
[15:48] a supply shock from a supply of a good
[15:51] it should come the only reason is pling
[15:54] of money for me is easy to see because
[15:57] if you have the same good and services
[16:00] at the end money is a ledger Ledger who
[16:02] owns what to who and uh if you have uh
[16:08] um a certain amount of money and then
[16:10] you double amount the amount of money
[16:12] it's natural that then the price H will
[16:15] start to go
[16:17] up because everything should be priced
[16:19] not double because it depends of what we
[16:22] value more uh but the price is going up
[16:27] I'm also saying in connection that
[16:30] Bitcoin is for everyone but
[16:32] understanding Bitcoin is very is not for
[16:34] everyone and is very hard so what is not
[16:37] there is also not an easy sentence where
[16:39] you can convince people and my goal is
[16:43] to bring if to ask people if they're
[16:45] interested and then showing the learning
[16:48] path and it takes a long amount of hours
[16:50] in order to understand this how really
[16:52] Economics work for me it was also not
[16:55] easy um I think for you as well and for
[16:57] many bitcoiners I read the Bitcoin
[16:59] standard the beginning and it was not
[17:01] okay then everything is clear I read
[17:03] other books on Austrian economics then
[17:05] now I'm reading I read book broken money
[17:07] then I read the principle of Economics
[17:09] from saf that was published this year so
[17:12] it's a long path important is people
[17:16] they who are curious they start to think
[17:19] okay then something can bro it should be
[17:21] is broken they grasp that something is
[17:24] broken let me dig on this if someone hop
[17:28] that in 10 minutes 30 minutes he can get
[17:32] how Austrian economics or how economics
[17:35] should work then it's unfortunate for
[17:38] him I say he didn't pass the test to
[17:41] understand Bitcoin um maybe we can take
[17:45] this uh into now get getting into your
[17:49] article and maybe um answering questions
[17:52] about why not gold why not an ETF why
[17:55] not something traditional why choosing
[17:59] Bitcoin right now good point why so
[18:02] Bitcoin in a short words is the
[18:05] opportunity of Our
[18:07] Generation The Generation before the
[18:09] invention of the generation before was
[18:12] the internet and it was clear 20 years
[18:15] after or 10 years after in the '90s no
[18:18] barely no one would have said and now
[18:20] it's clear that it was internet the
[18:22] invention or also we can also say the
[18:24] discovery because uh the absolutely
[18:26] absolute scarcity is at Discovery
[18:29] is uh the The Invention and discovery of
[18:32] Our
[18:32] Generation so H in March when there was
[18:37] the small bull run from 16 in January
[18:40] till 25 26 some people as as always some
[18:45] people ask me hey what about
[18:47] Bitcoin why so is increase and so on and
[18:51] instead to discuss with each of them I
[18:54] try to rationalize and u um say make my
[19:00] thoughts of what this person should know
[19:02] at first and uh after spending a few
[19:05] days some hours every day for few days I
[19:08] came out with an article that is 30
[19:11] minutes long now I think we should not
[19:13] go we cannot go in the deep but we can
[19:15] see um the the most important
[19:19] points firstly I look about the Bitcoin
[19:23] value
[19:25] proposition um people always ask is a
[19:27] good time to buy Bitcoin and my reply is
[19:30] always they should if they tolerate
[19:33] volatility and they know about Bitcoin
[19:36] then they can buy but it should be it
[19:37] should always be connected with the
[19:39] amount of education so my recommendation
[19:42] was always the only financial
[19:44] recommendation is spend maybe 1002 200
[19:47] EUR in Bitcoin because even if you think
[19:49] you lose it will not change your life
[19:50] but for the rest you need to study
[19:53] Bitcoin and um buy
[19:57] afterwards
[19:59] we can go so for me as I as I wrote in
[20:01] the article are three revolution in One
[20:04] Financial Revolution is for sure by far
[20:07] the best money that Humanity has ever
[20:09] had and I explain why technological
[20:13] Revolution after also is very important
[20:15] is not coming from nowhere but is a
[20:17] result of 40 Years of research and
[20:19] Innovation to find decentralized money
[20:23] and Satoshi Nakamoto made it join all
[20:26] this technology before most of the
[20:28] technology before Bitcoin he joined the
[20:30] he added the difficulty adjustment that
[20:33] made the system for the first time on
[20:35] human history work and third very
[20:39] important sometimes is underrated is the
[20:41] energetic Revolution now people think
[20:44] that Bitcoin is consuming too much
[20:46] energy or bad for the environment it's
[20:49] every this is very false very far from
[20:52] the truth the reality is is consuming is
[20:54] adding energy to the total
[20:56] energy and and uh more important he will
[21:01] by creating by validating the
[21:03] transaction and keeping the system safe
[21:06] it will also reduce the climate
[21:09] emissions especially methan emission
[21:11] that is the number one thread for our
[21:14] environment so this is kind of
[21:16] mind-blowing we will validate the
[21:18] transaction making the system safe by
[21:21] creating value Bitcoin and reducing
[21:24] metan emission at one point so this
[21:27] should be clear for the person and the
[21:30] biggest chunk of my article is why is so
[21:33] hard to understand Bitcoin as I said to
[21:36] you before in the interview
[21:38] understanding Bitcoin is very hard
[21:39] selection in terms of intellectual
[21:41] challenge first reason is why people why
[21:44] so hard because the price crashed from
[21:46] 2021 to 2022
[21:49] 77% and normally people are not
[21:51] interested when you see such a crash
[21:54] second is a very complex new technology
[21:58] and this is you see in the in the book
[22:01] The Internet of mon of
[22:03] antonoplos every time there is a new
[22:05] technology most of the world 99% of the
[22:08] world or plus is always skeptical as it
[22:11] happened with electricity with a car
[22:14] automobile telephone and wi the internet
[22:16] here we can see 1998 a Nobel Prize 1998
[22:21] said that by 2005 it will become clear
[22:24] that the internet impact on the economy
[22:26] has been no greater than the Fox
[22:28] machines now we are 25 years after I
[22:31] think everyone recognized that the
[22:34] internet had a a
[22:36] small only a small a bigger Impact
[22:40] versus the fax machine this is was an
[22:42] article against electricity so they
[22:44] should also know that every time there
[22:46] is a new technology is normal that the
[22:48] vast majority is against then includes
[22:51] very high numbers we we talk about
[22:53] quadrillion
[22:55] quintili and uh we need to know that we
[22:58] are not by default we are not good to
[23:00] understand these numbers we need to put
[23:02] effort in order to understand
[23:05] them then we move to very
[23:07] multidisciplinary topic here I put 12
[23:10] subject that it cover there is no other
[23:12] subject that includes another topic or
[23:15] asset that includes to understand it you
[23:18] have to be at least a good you have to
[23:21] have a good understanding of 12
[23:22] different subjects and no one by default
[23:25] has so much knowledge so you need to
[23:28] study at least something on each of them
[23:30] before understanding
[23:32] Bitcoin then very important on uh and
[23:35] this also Bitcoin not crypto it's a
[23:37] perfect almost perfect new technology I
[23:40] also put the example from MB where he's
[23:44] saying he was saying that he was trying
[23:46] to improve Bitcoin for six months and he
[23:49] didn't reach because whenever he was
[23:51] improving something the tradeoff was
[23:53] high higher than the Ben than the
[23:56] benefit so at then he conclude that you
[23:59] cannot really improve while we are used
[24:02] to have maybe the first airplane and
[24:04] then the airplane are improved then we
[24:06] are used to have cars the first car and
[24:09] then the cars are improved so people
[24:11] think okay Bitcoin is old technology so
[24:14] there will be a new coin tell me which
[24:15] is the new Bitcoin the new Bitcoin it
[24:19] doesn't exist and this is hard to
[24:21] believe for human being it it should be
[24:24] more considered to U related to a
[24:28] discovery of fire or the will you cannot
[24:31] reinvent the will the fire also we have
[24:34] the fire since tens of thousand of years
[24:38] so it should be close to that but uh by
[24:41] default people are very skeptical to
[24:43] think that something was discovered and
[24:45] this already the best
[24:47] technology then I think as you have seen
[24:49] also discussing with bitcoiners with the
[24:52] nor with nor people who don't know about
[24:54] Bitcoin the level of education and
[24:57] economics is very poor and this I'm also
[25:00] impressed among qualified and very
[25:02] qualified people question like what is
[25:05] money which properties makes money of
[25:08] good form of
[25:09] money when governments print money where
[25:12] does this money come from that are basic
[25:15] in if someone has a basic knowledge of
[25:18] Economics even very many qualified
[25:21] people are not able to answer that's why
[25:23] they think that money should come from
[25:25] the government 2% inflation a good
[25:28] inflation we need money to stimulate the
[25:30] economy nothing more far than the truth
[25:35] so people should learn the real
[25:38] economics then we have many
[25:40] misconception we can go this later and
[25:44] is very counter counter counterintuitive
[25:47] in many different aspects so bitcoiners
[25:50] we are used to say we should live in a
[25:52] deflationary economy or the energy
[25:54] channeled by Bitcoin mining is
[25:55] contributing to our development or
[25:57] Bitcoin mining will be good for the
[25:59] environment or I don't like Risk that's
[26:02] why I'm saving in Bitcoin and they are
[26:04] not only difficult to grasp but it's
[26:09] also difficult to think that they could
[26:11] even be true and this is another reason
[26:15] why it's very hard for the common person
[26:18] to understand Bitcoin here I explain why
[26:22] Bitcoin is not crypto and many people as
[26:25] especially at the beginning of the
[26:26] journey they think that is uh they are
[26:29] belong Bitcoin belongs to crypto very
[26:32] far from the
[26:33] truth here I also listed the the 20
[26:37] misconception and I also have a a video
[26:40] related to each of
[26:41] them I think you have heard many of them
[26:44] as well not backed by anything no
[26:46] intrinsic value the financial World Is
[26:49] Still skeptical um Bitcoin mining should
[26:52] move to proof of stake too volatile it
[26:54] doesn't have industrial value can be
[26:57] replace by another coin and so on and uh
[27:01] we I have one video in order to debank
[27:05] uh each of
[27:08] them do yeah maybe we stop do you have a
[27:10] can we sum C can we summarize all the
[27:15] reasons um that people don't grasp for
[27:19] Bitcoin in either a lack of trying to
[27:23] understand it so like kind of a laziness
[27:26] you don't want to put in the work and
[27:28] the other component is fear they are
[27:31] fearing for something new they are
[27:32] fearing for something they don't
[27:35] understand they have fear that too much
[27:38] change is are those the two main
[27:42] components H yes but yes yes
[27:45] firstly put firstly they should
[27:48] understand that it requires work and
[27:49] people want to understand Bitcoin in one
[27:51] hour later I said also that uh we need
[27:54] at least at least 250 hours if it was
[27:58] for me as I tell to everyone everyone
[28:00] who spend less than 250 hours should be
[28:02] considered as not having enough
[28:04] education to have a a validate op valid
[28:08] opinion on bitcoin and very few they can
[28:11] do and yeah you are right on the second
[28:13] is the fear I would say with connect
[28:16] with two things for me one curiosity not
[28:19] many have this curiosity to look for
[28:21] something new as you said they're mostly
[28:24] going to a standard path um
[28:28] where other people did the path and then
[28:31] they're following like now buying ETFs
[28:34] bonds stocks and so on and very
[28:38] important you have to think that you
[28:41] will give you have to question many
[28:44] things that you give for granted and I
[28:46] also included here for example for the
[28:49] expert it's very hard for an expert on
[28:52] economics of canes economics to
[28:55] understand Bitcoin because uh the more
[28:59] you are an expert the more is hard for
[29:01] you to understand that your knowledge
[29:04] that you give always for granted in
[29:07] reality is uh not true like you always
[29:10] this okay this is true not questionable
[29:12] for 20 15 20 years and it's very hard in
[29:15] the brain so you have to also be
[29:18] prepared to question things that you
[29:21] have always been G given for granted for
[29:25] the whole
[29:26] life
[29:28] here this we can connect with the expert
[29:30] the more you're an expert from the
[29:32] economics world the harder will be for
[29:34] your egoo for your ego and for your
[29:37] self-esteem to give uh to say Okay I I
[29:41] am 20 15 years in economics that was uh
[29:45] not true like it's not how economics
[29:47] should work it's much easier from an
[29:50] outsider perspective for example you see
[29:53] safy sailor sa I don't know but sailor
[29:56] breed love many other
[29:57] they studied engineering so they didn't
[30:00] work only in economics before there are
[30:03] also some people like Greg F James
[30:05] lavish um cus Jesse Myers also who are
[30:10] coming from economics investment world
[30:12] but many they're coming from
[30:14] Outsider so I think that's another
[30:17] important
[30:19] reason can you maybe for the people
[30:22] don't know it uh because you talked
[30:25] about the kanesan economics and the a
[30:27] economics um like we should not go too
[30:30] deep into that because it's a big topic
[30:32] but what is the main difference uh what
[30:35] is what is the signature of kesan
[30:38] economics and the signature of austan
[30:41] Economics to understand the difference
[30:43] and why are the atin economics bitcoiner
[30:47] and the kesan economics against Bitcoin
[30:50] Bitcoin yes so are making a short like
[30:54] in two sentences K's economics is about
[30:57] spending Austrian economics is valuing
[31:01] savings according to K economics to
[31:05] stimulate the economy we need more
[31:06] spending and if we have a problem with
[31:09] recession we need to print money to
[31:12] stimulate the economy that for the
[31:14] normal person sounds good like it sounds
[31:17] it makes sense while in reality the
[31:21] longterm tradeoff is much higher than
[31:24] the benefit in the short term according
[31:27] to Austrian economics the process of
[31:29] civilization is found is founded in
[31:33] savings savings not only in money but
[31:35] only in time so is when we were talking
[31:38] about the time preference when you value
[31:41] the F not the future not more than the
[31:43] present but the ratio between how you
[31:45] value the present versus the future it's
[31:49] less than another person so you lower
[31:51] your time preference you spend more time
[31:54] for the future this is when civil
[31:57] ization start for example we instead of
[32:00] to only produce cars we we stop and we
[32:04] try to invest money and time in making
[32:07] the process more productive or there was
[32:10] a classical example instead to go with a
[32:12] hand to fish to fish eight hours a day
[32:15] and you try to spend some times in order
[32:17] to build some tools to become more
[32:19] productive and uh then you you have some
[32:22] tools then you have a small ship then
[32:25] you have a bigger ship so you need much
[32:27] less time to catch the same fish and
[32:30] this is why and how Humanity progressed
[32:35] so it's very different U perspective
[32:37] because for canes for can's economics
[32:40] savings are really bad canes will stop
[32:43] economy and we will have a recession
[32:45] while nothing can be far from through
[32:48] but I admit if a person didn't study
[32:50] economics and is surrounded by this
[32:52] economic kind's economics they say 2%
[32:55] inflation is good it's very hard to
[32:58] understand that it doesn't the K
[33:00] economics doesn't make any sense and uh
[33:03] it will be more and more clear in the
[33:05] next years when the US depth will be
[33:08] higher and higher is in an unsustainable
[33:12] path there is nothing that can stop the
[33:15] US debt to increase and increase and
[33:18] also I always say reflect we say that we
[33:21] live in a capitalist Society capitalist
[33:24] is a capital accumulation
[33:28] in reality we are living in a society of
[33:30] depth where everyone is having Dept and
[33:33] even in us they have Dept for holidays
[33:36] for a TV for they have a credit card
[33:38] Dept on another credit card so the
[33:40] system you're are working is broken the
[33:42] economic system is broken the only
[33:44] economy that makes sense is the Austrian
[33:47] School of
[33:48] Economics maybe I was to bit too
[33:51] long that was great I think um austri
[33:56] like when when you have someone only
[33:59] being in that environment about Kanan
[34:02] economics and not ever seeing the a
[34:06] economic sides it's hard to grasp yes
[34:10] but but even for people that are not on
[34:14] either side they are just um not
[34:18] informed about uh a economics or KES and
[34:21] economics they are tending more towards
[34:24] The KES and economics I yes because
[34:29] it's is the is how we live we always
[34:32] hear from the media that 2% inflation is
[34:34] good we need we have a recession we need
[34:37] to stimulate the economy uh the problem
[34:40] is the the big depression or recession
[34:42] that have happened happened because we
[34:45] have K's economics otherwise they would
[34:47] not have happened but it's hard to grasp
[34:50] but I think one one very important
[34:52] things and um you want to have a
[34:55] question Robin
[34:59] I'm I'm just uh like you just said that
[35:03] the crashes are because of kanes and
[35:05] economics so you would say there would
[35:07] not be a financial crisis on a sound
[35:11] money system at
[35:14] all so um
[35:16] worldwide collapse they would never be
[35:19] in sounds economic economic system so if
[35:23] you study also economics you see that
[35:25] there are some business that cred some
[35:27] business are but some other business
[35:29] grow also because the economics is also
[35:32] human actions what we like and what we
[35:35] we value what we PR which price we give
[35:38] so it can happen that a business is
[35:40] decreasing but another is increasing the
[35:43] two
[35:44] biggest depression that we had were n
[35:49] 1929 no one know almost no one is very
[35:53] few people are alive to remember maybe
[35:55] they were born but they don't remember
[35:57] and
[35:58] 2008 and it's not a coincidence that uh
[36:02] people you should say I always say you
[36:04] remember the the 20s are called The
[36:06] Roaring 20s one of the reason is because
[36:10] they stimulate the economy and they
[36:12] increase the supply money supply 65% in
[36:17] four or five years while the the gold
[36:19] was increased only 10 12% so they
[36:22] created this
[36:23] bubble and this is a bubble burst once
[36:26] you create the Bumble the only way to
[36:30] reset you should be throw a burst and we
[36:33] saw the burst in
[36:35] 1929 the same 2008 if you remember the
[36:38] beginning of the 20 2000 they were
[36:41] giving credit loans to build uh to
[36:45] houses and many people there was no
[36:47] almost no interest rates and they
[36:51] increase uh many people took loans even
[36:53] if they didn't have any savings or no
[36:55] downtown paying so the increase also
[36:58] fractional Reserve banking getting loans
[37:00] from nothing from thin air is increasing
[37:02] the money supply and this create a
[37:04] bubble and in 2008 we saw the crash so
[37:09] I'm really convinced that in a sound
[37:11] monetary system with fixed or limited
[37:13] money supply there would not be any
[37:17] Financial uh crash worldwide financial
[37:23] crash that's a crazy concept and I think
[37:26] uh
[37:27] a lot of people would struggle a lot
[37:29] with compreh comprehending that and this
[37:33] goes back what you said you need a lot
[37:35] of time to learn about Bitcoin about
[37:37] sound money about the complete system
[37:40] because it's simply not an easy topic
[37:42] it's it's it's not something you can
[37:44] learn in in one hour and you're like oh
[37:47] now I get it yes you need to dive deep
[37:50] for at least I would say um 100 hours to
[37:55] really understand it if you want to have
[37:57] a general idea what Bitcoin is I think
[37:59] 10 hours of focused learning um give you
[38:04] the the surface
[38:06] View and but you should go deeper uh if
[38:10] you kind of have the time it it it
[38:14] really pays off to go deeper than the
[38:16] first 10
[38:17] hours and so you can really grasp what's
[38:20] going on um is there anything more you
[38:23] want to share from that article any
[38:26] learnings more uh you want to give uh
[38:30] the
[38:31] audience H the only thing is related to
[38:34] the path to understand Bitcoin I think
[38:37] for me 100 hours are to appreciate it
[38:39] and 250 hours is to understand it and uh
[38:43] I also had many conversation thinks okay
[38:46] but Bitcoin should be for everyone how
[38:49] we how we can make easy for a person who
[38:51] didn't study Bitcoin I say is not
[38:54] possible in
[38:55] 20222 3 or 24 to understand
[38:59] Bitcoin um without studying in 20 years
[39:04] people will save in Bitcoin without uh
[39:07] even knowing what it is but now while
[39:11] the general knowledge is okay it's very
[39:13] volatile it's very risky asset the only
[39:15] way there is no shortcut the the I want
[39:19] sorry I want to share only one thing and
[39:22] this about and I think this is the
[39:25] difficulty in understanding Bitcoin will
[39:26] go down with time so the more time we
[39:30] pass more brains can join us it's like a
[39:34] hard selection now I estimated only
[39:36] 100,000 people not more they really
[39:38] understood Bitcoin it could be 200,000
[39:40] or 300,000 but for sure not more and
[39:44] with time the entry level the barrier it
[39:48] will be lower so more people can join
[39:52] compare we should compare Bitcoin for me
[39:54] the best example understanding Bitcoin
[39:57] is running a marathon of under three
[39:59] hours to reach that goal you have to
[40:01] have a good trainer so the trainer will
[40:03] be the bitcoiner and you need to do the
[40:05] hard physical work to reach the
[40:07] condition needed to be able to run fast
[40:09] for that long so fast for that long the
[40:12] concept for Bitcoin is the same not we
[40:15] can be the trainers we can explain you
[40:18] the reasons why we believe in Bitcoin
[40:21] and we can also enlight for you the best
[40:23] path to understand as a trainer in
[40:25] saying you need to do this for two weeks
[40:27] this for three weeks we can say you need
[40:29] to study this this and this but we
[40:32] cannot do the work for you you need to
[40:35] do it obviously if you're passionate and
[40:37] curious on the subject as for the
[40:40] marathon without the training required
[40:42] you don't give a chance to your body to
[40:44] reach your goal without the 20 250 hours
[40:48] of deep study you are not giving your
[40:50] brain a Chan to understand
[40:52] it and bitcoiners for for us every we
[40:55] love to educate people in in any
[40:58] circumstances so we always like you can
[41:01] always find trainers but then you need
[41:03] to do the work I think that's also one
[41:05] topic that I I never see such a
[41:08] comparison but I think for me it fits
[41:12] perfectly that that's so great Alexandro
[41:15] I never um compared it with running a
[41:19] marathon and I also liked what you said
[41:22] earlier about um we are not now seeing
[41:27] it to be difficult uh that you
[41:30] understand Bitcoin but in 10 20 30 40
[41:34] years Bitcoin will be more and more
[41:37] normal at each step of the way so more
[41:40] and more uh Bitcoin will be uh just
[41:45] grained into our Liv as as a
[41:49] fundament so sorry please go
[41:54] ahead it I just wanted to continue that
[41:57] it's a fundament of our life and um
[42:01] right now people are saying okay savings
[42:05] account and ETFs is kind of normal like
[42:08] if you're saying to some random person
[42:10] on the street uh put your money uh a
[42:14] little bit on the side of your bank
[42:16] account maybe on a savings account and
[42:19] uh what you want to invest put it in an
[42:21] an S&P 500 in an ETF this is an
[42:24] uncontroversial opin opinion for most
[42:27] people I think for but this opinion when
[42:33] it changes slowly and slowly and Bitcoin
[42:36] is getting really to this mainstream
[42:39] adoption then Bitcoin will be part of
[42:42] that solution and I think it will slowly
[42:45] get to a part of the solution where
[42:47] people saying put uh 20% into Bitcoin
[42:50] and the rest in something else then 30%
[42:53] 40% I think the norm of having a Bitcoin
[42:56] stack will increase till it's uh your
[43:00] standard savings uh account and then on
[43:04] top of that savings account you can
[43:06] maybe invest in a stock that you're imp
[43:09] passionate about in your own project in
[43:11] your own company uh and and you take out
[43:14] the uh saving side of investing that the
[43:18] saving side should always be in Bitcoin
[43:20] and the investing side should only be
[43:23] about investing in new Ventures and not
[43:26] in Saving like ETFs is an we vehicle in
[43:32] our life we would not need when we would
[43:36] have Bitcoin I think yes I I totally so
[43:40] I totally agree with you that um the
[43:43] more we go the more Bitcoin will be seen
[43:47] as a savings account so they will start
[43:50] to have one two
[43:52] 5% and at the moment so far it doesn't
[43:55] reach the value of institutional is not
[43:57] only the best savings account it is also
[44:00] the best
[44:00] investment way because he on the path of
[44:04] monetization so it will increase the
[44:06] value and it I think will be I always
[44:10] also saw in the article it will be
[44:11] gradually and then suddenly at one point
[44:15] there will be this inflation inflection
[44:17] point where people start to realize okay
[44:20] real estate we have a high um interest
[44:24] rate is not anymore more so profitable
[44:28] stocks many people talk about um many
[44:32] people talk about recession so it could
[44:35] be risky bonds we see now that if
[44:38] inflation will be high is high bonds
[44:41] don't even catch up with inflation and
[44:44] on one side note macro mcro not next
[44:47] year I assume I'm following also
[44:49] microeconomics as every bitcoiner and um
[44:53] they will have to print a ton of money
[44:55] to keep keep the broken system running
[44:57] so inflation will be higher so there
[45:00] will be so many hundreds of million of
[45:03] trillions that are in bonds real estate
[45:07] stocks ETFs and Bitcoin will start to
[45:10] increase there will be the Bitcoin spot
[45:13] ETF uh approved so for those people who
[45:16] don't want to hold the asset itself they
[45:19] will have also a chance to start buying
[45:22] the ETF and maybe later on some of them
[45:24] will move to the real as
[45:26] first it might be in an exchange and
[45:28] then two on the real asset but there
[45:29] will be a global exposure to bitcoin and
[45:34] uh I always make the joke that I made is
[45:37] once we reach this inflection
[45:39] point we did a lot of work in the past
[45:42] to understand Bitcoin but we could also
[45:45] just lie on a beach and drink coconut
[45:48] from a coconut and we will outperform
[45:52] any financial advisor Investment Company
[45:55] who spend 40 60 80 hours per per week
[46:00] trying to research which is the best
[46:01] bond which is the best stock which is
[46:04] the best ETF we just buying and hold we
[46:08] will outperform very by far Mo any
[46:13] Financial advice or maybe 99% there
[46:16] could be someone who have a special
[46:18] stock but 99% we will outperform by far
[46:22] that said is not a financial advice the
[46:24] only advice I give is
[46:26] um study Bitcoin and the everything that
[46:30] you own in Bitcoin it should be in
[46:32] proportion of your
[46:34] convention you should also to to not to
[46:37] be stressed by the volatility you need
[46:41] to have convention I also I think also
[46:43] some bitcoiners say you you never check
[46:45] the price I think that's not true I also
[46:47] like to check the price also because
[46:48] firstly for selfesteem I want to know
[46:51] that I was right I think I'm right but
[46:54] this should be the prove and this will
[46:56] be the price going up and secondly it
[46:59] will allow many people more to join with
[47:02] a price higher the thing is that if the
[47:04] price is crashes it's not touching my
[47:06] strategy or my convention because I
[47:09] understand Bitcoin that's a big
[47:10] difference also a new Joiner is checking
[47:13] the price if Bitcoin goes out goes down
[47:15] 5% that is normal and they kind of get
[47:18] stress that is why they need to learn
[47:21] they need to study
[47:24] before yeah it's I think the US dollar
[47:28] or the Euro price like the feat price of
[47:31] Bitcoin is always first a great
[47:34] marketing tool and second it's just
[47:37] great to keep score uh of H how are we
[47:40] adopting right now uh but it's in the
[47:43] short term it's volatile uh and it does
[47:46] not matter but it's just fun and
[47:49] entertaining to look at and of course it
[47:51] brings people in and my next question
[47:54] would be about fat um do you think we do
[48:00] you think that Fiat money is surviving
[48:03] the next 50 years like we saw now a
[48:06] little bit over 50 years of feat money
[48:09] history when we see the real start of
[48:12] fat money at 9071 and we have now over
[48:15] 50 years do we see another 50 60 70
[48:19] years of feat money or is this a form of
[48:23] money that is just running out and uh we
[48:28] are not seeing it anymore in maybe 50 to
[48:31] 70
[48:33] years I also think no not even 50 I
[48:36] think will not survives in the next 30
[48:39] Years and this I think is a strong
[48:41] statement that a person who doesn't know
[48:43] economics would be like oh
[48:45] wow but uh this is also gradually and
[48:49] then suddenly it uh the US depth is now
[48:52] at
[48:54] 33.8 and it took maybe 200 years to
[48:57] reach one trillion or 150 then it took
[48:59] 10 years to reach another trillion in
[49:02] the last six months it or four months it
[49:07] was increased as if in one year it would
[49:09] be Six Trillion so like uh three
[49:12] trillion in four or five months so it's
[49:15] increasing
[49:17] exponentially and uh every Fiat money is
[49:21] a broken system that has only two
[49:23] outcomes there are only two the outcomes
[49:25] for every Fiat
[49:28] system hyper hper inflation
[49:30] hyperinflation or the fault of the
[49:33] government um that is creating this fat
[49:36] currency also we see Lawrence leopard is
[49:39] also famous in the Bitcoin World is's
[49:40] saying that we can see hyper
[49:44] inflation by the end of the decade I I
[49:47] hope also that we will not see so fast
[49:51] but uh we already um passed the
[49:53] inflection point we cannot go back now
[49:55] it doesn't matter what we do the the
[49:58] depbt will keep Rising H some
[50:02] inputs the interest of debt moved from
[50:05] 600 billion to almost 1 trillion so
[50:09] let's say us
[50:11] system is having 130% depbt versus GDP
[50:16] not only that but the expenses is 6.2
[50:20] trillion while the taxes are 4.4
[50:24] trillion so we have a debt a huge debt
[50:26] that is higher than our Revenue per
[50:30] year and we are running a deficit it's
[50:33] like we take a credit card to pay
[50:34] another credit card to pay another
[50:36] credit card so it and is also increasing
[50:40] because the interest of the depth is
[50:42] even higher than def fense so the and us
[50:45] is spending a ton of money in Def fense
[50:48] he spending I think 800 900 billions and
[50:51] now the interest is just one trillion
[50:53] just the interest to pay to repay pay
[50:55] the debt second with this High interest
[50:58] rate there will be less taxes because
[51:01] people will go out less and we have to
[51:04] spend less and secondly the next uh in
[51:07] the next third three years 45% of the
[51:11] depbt will be renegotiated not anymore
[51:14] at 2 3% but at 6 7 8% interest rate so
[51:19] we are already going fast and we will go
[51:22] faster and faster for the same Moto
[51:25] graph ually and then suddenly I think
[51:27] next years we will see high inflation
[51:30] five six 7
[51:32] 10% and they they print money they will
[51:34] print money not because they want print
[51:36] M to print money to stimulate the
[51:38] economy but because it's the only way to
[51:42] keep the system
[51:43] running plus there were also some issue
[51:46] kind of we can see already the first
[51:48] issues in the action bonds I'm following
[51:50] James leish lavish and he's also very
[51:53] knowledgeable of bonds there the last
[51:56] auctions on selling bonds they didn't
[51:58] see the same demand as before and at one
[52:00] point we may see something never
[52:04] happened that the go the state want to
[52:07] sell bonds and there will be no people
[52:10] uh wanting this
[52:11] months I think for the gradually and
[52:14] suddenly it will be before 20 25 years I
[52:17] only hope it will be not so hard but at
[52:21] one point it will escalate it takes it
[52:25] also US dollars is uh lucky because
[52:27] there is demand overall everything is
[52:29] based on US dollars I think there is a
[52:31] big percentage of all transaction in the
[52:33] world that are made in US dollars so
[52:35] this is slowing down the curve gradually
[52:39] and then suddenly but the the trend is
[52:42] clear it's unsustainable and we already
[52:44] passed the deflection
[52:48] Point wow I think that's an amazing
[52:54] point to
[52:56] uh stop uh the interview it's like I
[53:00] hear why we covered why Bitcoin is so
[53:02] important and why it's hard to
[53:04] understand and why it's important to if
[53:06] you want to go in Bitcoin right now to
[53:09] put in the work and put in the hours uh
[53:11] of education and then also the fear
[53:14] system why it's de bleeding so fast and
[53:18] why it's the bleeding um till it will
[53:23] just bleed out to death BAS basically
[53:26] and I just love your explanations you I
[53:29] don't have to interrupt you I don't have
[53:32] to ask you any questions after it
[53:35] because you are giving a really good and
[53:38] full explanation I I I love how you are
[53:41] you doing this I so you know that's
[53:45] actually my first episode of this
[53:47] podcast so I want to have an end routine
[53:52] uh to this podcast where the podcast
[53:56] guest asks the next guest a
[54:00] question um without knowing who will be
[54:03] the next
[54:04] guest and as this is the first episode I
[54:07] don't have a previous guest that has a
[54:10] question for you so I asked um in my
[54:15] house right now what question can I ask
[54:18] you and they didn't know you so uh it
[54:20] was a similar uh similar comparison and
[54:24] the question we came up in the house
[54:26] where what traditions or routines do you
[54:30] have in your life that you couldn't live
[54:33] without you that you cannot live
[54:37] without so good question and first thing
[54:41] I would say work out regularly I'm
[54:45] strong believer that our mind can be
[54:47] trained only if we have strong uh strong
[54:51] meaning not like full of muscul body but
[54:54] training of on cardio endurance so I'm
[54:56] doing sport almost every day and uh
[55:00] second always discuss also we come back
[55:04] also to kind of aan Economics value the
[55:07] time so I always reserve some time to
[55:10] discuss to spend for sure with my
[55:12] girlfriend and some with my friends but
[55:14] also some is also in learning and
[55:16] reading new thing so I think these are
[55:19] the my my weekly routine I don't have
[55:23] like something special that I do every
[55:26] morning a part of breakfast sometimes
[55:27] doing the training or when I go to sleep
[55:31] but it's most it's more evaluate like I
[55:34] have 120 hours per week um where I can
[55:39] where I'm awake for sure a por should go
[55:42] to work and then to decide what to do
[55:45] with the rest and try to Value it at at
[55:47] the top always also considering that
[55:50] some of the for sure some of the time
[55:51] should go in full Leisure so I also see
[55:54] serious in netx or having time where I
[55:58] just doing Leisure but it should be a
[56:00] balance oh perfect
[56:03] um thank you Alexandro for being on my
[56:06] show uh being my my first guest and uh I
[56:10] really hope we can do it uh in in the
[56:12] future again and uh I Lov your
[56:17] explanations and your uh
[56:20] insights uh thank thanks for you to
[56:22] invite me I also following you in
[56:24] Twitter and it's amazing to see your
[56:26] posts and also that's also you see that
[56:29] we have really similar minds not only
[56:31] from how that you post for about Bitcoin
[56:34] but your kind of posts and I think also
[56:37] we are a kind of similar uh path you
[56:40] have like five point more than 5,000 I
[56:43] will reach 5,000 followers soon so we
[56:46] are like growing together in X we are
[56:48] similar mindset on bitcoin so really
[56:51] happy to connect with other
[56:53] bitcoiners let let's grow together
[56:56] byebye yes bye bye Rob
