[00:00] The Bitcoin journey is deeply deeply
[00:02] individual. It's deeply personal. So
[00:04] it's like you and you know books,
[00:07] podcasts, content in general that you
[00:10] consume. Started my Bitcoin journey in
[00:12] 2017. And I've ride those waves and
[00:16] adoption cycles all the way to 2025 or
[00:19] mid 2025 where we are today. I I've
[00:21] never been more bullish on Bitcoin. If
[00:23] you ask somebody new to Bitcoin today uh
[00:26] about Bitcoin Talk, I would I would
[00:28] pretty confidently say that a majority
[00:30] of newcomers to Bitcoin today have never
[00:34] set foot, have never typed
[00:36] bitcointalk.org in their browser ever.
[00:38] The monetary properties, the predictable
[00:41] issuance, the cap and how Bitcoin is a
[00:44] savings technology, it's going to be
[00:46] life-changing. And I think the same
[00:47] thing when you scale up to, you know,
[00:49] Trafi, Legacy Finance, just the fact
[00:51] that they connect that they integrate
[00:53] Bitcoin is is going to make their
[00:55] services so much better and more
[00:56] efficient.
[01:01] So before we get started with all the
[01:04] topics, maybe give us some some quick
[01:06] overview of who you are and and why
[01:07] you're excited about uh Bitcoin. Um, so
[01:11] uh I'm Fernando. I'm the VP of marketing
[01:14] and communications at Blockstream and
[01:16] I'm also the founder of uh perception um
[01:20] which is well majority of people uh will
[01:22] probably know Blockstream uh it's the
[01:24] you know global leader in Bitcoin and
[01:26] blockchain infrastructure uh CEO Adam
[01:29] Bach uh legend in the game uh been
[01:32] around Blockstream has been around since
[01:34] 2014 and we're kind of like building uh
[01:36] the infrastructure uh for uh for Bitcoin
[01:39] um uh Bitcoin perception is the uh data
[01:42] intelligence platform that I founded
[01:44] last year. Uh essentially what it does
[01:47] is just gathers um data from 100 plus
[01:50] sources uh in terms of how Bitcoin uh
[01:53] stable coin tokenized finance those type
[01:55] of things are being covered uh in the
[01:58] mainstream media in legacy media crypto
[02:01] media but also Reddit stacker news
[02:04] Twitter uh and X and and yeah 100 plus
[02:07] sources and I take all of that data and
[02:10] uh you know have a trend discovery
[02:12] service and also sentiment analysis on
[02:14] whether certain topics, how they are
[02:17] being covered, and whether these things
[02:18] are covered in a negative or a positive
[02:21] way. Um, I'm originally from Argentina,
[02:24] so you know, back in 2017 when uh when
[02:27] um a friend of mine introduced me to
[02:28] Bitcoin, I was already uh I already knew
[02:31] about what inflation means. Um I grew up
[02:34] in Norway when I was uh when I was a
[02:36] kid. My mom immigrated from Argentina
[02:38] when I was uh 5 years old because of a
[02:42] hyperinflationary dumpster fire uh that
[02:44] happened in in Argentina in 1989. Every
[02:47] time when I went back to see my family
[02:48] cuz my dad and the rest of my family was
[02:50] in Argentina, uh inflation was always a
[02:53] topic of conversation again and again.
[02:56] So uh as as uh you know as a young uh
[03:00] student uh I try to understand what is
[03:02] this inflation thing that people are
[03:03] talking about and why aren't we learning
[03:05] about this in school. Uh that led me
[03:07] through you know uh just reading books
[03:09] on my own uh learning about you know uh
[03:13] gold learning about uh you know Milton
[03:16] Freriedman and and and all the classic
[03:18] Austrians. Uh so by the time Bitcoin uh
[03:21] came to my door in 2017 uh through my
[03:24] friend I I kind like understood the
[03:25] monetary properties of Bitcoin and that
[03:27] was the initial thing I kind of like the
[03:30] the thing that still gets me excited
[03:32] about Bitcoin are the monetary
[03:33] properties. So um that's that's my uh
[03:37] that's my background. I also before uh
[03:40] you know before Blockstream I started my
[03:42] career in the music business uh in
[03:45] Norway. I was a country manager for
[03:46] Universal Music Group. Uh, and I was in
[03:49] the middle of uh kind of like the uh the
[03:51] craziness around uh the Pirate Bay, if
[03:54] uh if you remember that. Um, torrenting,
[03:56] streaming was a thing that was very
[03:58] disruptive to the music business and I
[04:00] really wanted to get on top of that, but
[04:02] you know, I was uh too young to uh to
[04:04] have enough uh influence in the
[04:06] boardrooms. Uh so eventually I kind of
[04:08] like got frustrated with the music
[04:10] business and uh and quit. Um but I feel
[04:13] like my career has always been uh you
[04:16] know close to disruptive technologies
[04:18] and I think Bitcoin is kind of like
[04:20] doing the same uh for uh for you know
[04:23] legacy uh finance traditional banking
[04:25] and it's really exciting to be close to
[04:27] the action uh working at a blockstream.
[04:29] So uh yeah that's TLDDR on me. Ah that's
[04:32] awesome. when we talked about before
[04:34] that that we kind of want to talk about
[04:36] the the narrative wars and I think
[04:37] that's that topic is so interesting
[04:39] because I often describe ourselves like
[04:42] people that educate in the Bitcoin space
[04:44] and there actually from uh from people
[04:46] like Robert Pedlo, Michael Sailor like
[04:48] the the biggest ones in the space till
[04:50] like someone that just talks to their
[04:52] mother and Orange like one person. I
[04:55] think we all are digital or offline
[04:58] soldiers in in kind of the this Bitcoin
[05:00] narrative warfare. um what what do you
[05:03] kind of see in how the the narrative is
[05:06] shaping in in in Bitcoin? And I want to
[05:09] get into something a little bit later
[05:11] after that with internal and external
[05:14] wars uh in in narrative war because I
[05:17] think we have a lot of narrative uh
[05:20] fightings internally in in Bitcoin. But
[05:22] then like as a Bitcoin community outside
[05:25] to like
[05:27] 99.9% to the other uh people that uh
[05:30] aren't uh in the Bitcoin community yet.
[05:33] That's super interesting. I'm super
[05:35] happy that you want to bring that up as
[05:36] well. So we got a lot of lot of stuff to
[05:38] go through. Uh but yeah, I think just on
[05:40] a high level, my my personal
[05:42] understanding is, you know, looking
[05:44] around at where we are right now, it's
[05:47] obvious that we can all feel that
[05:49] Bitcoin is now at a at a pivotal moment
[05:52] when it comes to uh its adoption cycle.
[05:56] We're kind of like moving from the
[05:58] fringes of finance to the center of, you
[06:02] know, global uh economic narratives. And
[06:06] I think that as Bitcoin is
[06:09] maturing, it is maturing and kind like
[06:12] entering this new stage at the very
[06:14] moment where the media landscape is
[06:16] totally fragmenting. So I think it's
[06:18] super interesting because what once
[06:21] operated as like centralized gatekeepers
[06:24] of public opinion is now splintered into
[06:28] you know countless platforms and each of
[06:31] those platforms
[06:33] uh has its own agenda.
[06:35] bias, narrative, slant, uh you know, and
[06:40] and then within each platforms is all
[06:42] the outlets and all the influencers who
[06:44] also have their own agenda, their own
[06:46] bias, their own narrative sl. I think uh
[06:50] exploring how these shifts are shaping
[06:55] uh how the world sees Bitcoin is super
[06:59] interesting and it's also interesting to
[07:02] see while why some narratives are
[07:04] gaining traction and then why other
[07:06] narratives are kind of like getting
[07:07] buried and and then how the dynamics of
[07:10] this fragmentation
[07:12] uh could affect Bitcoin adoption in the
[07:15] years ahead because I do think
[07:17] that we all have our own personal orange
[07:20] pilling story. Uh I I personally think
[07:24] that um uh the journey the Bitcoin
[07:30] journey is deeply deeply individual.
[07:32] It's deeply personal. So it's like you
[07:35] and you know books, podcasts, content in
[07:39] general that you consume and then try to
[07:41] like get a get your own understanding of
[07:44] right and the people who are talking to
[07:45] you in that process. I mean, the
[07:47] podcasters that you're choosing to
[07:49] listen to, the books, the authors that
[07:51] you're choosing to read uh books from,
[07:53] they are all part of that journey and
[07:55] it's a very like one-on-one
[07:56] communication and you just like choose
[07:59] your influencers, your authors, your
[08:02] podcasters very carefully and then you
[08:04] kind of like stick around and you uh
[08:07] listen to more episodes or more content
[08:09] or more or read more books from the same
[08:11] authors and that shapes your world view.
[08:15] Now somebody else also interested in
[08:17] Bitcoin who have uh you know listened to
[08:21] completely different sets of authors,
[08:23] podcasters and and influencers might
[08:26] also like Bitcoin but for completely
[08:28] different reasons than your own and then
[08:31] you know when you are then orange peel
[08:33] and you know as as it's very common uh
[08:37] once you understand Bitcoin you kind of
[08:39] want to go to the top of the mountain
[08:40] and just shout it out right you now want
[08:42] to orange peel other people and you are
[08:44] now becoming the influencer, then that's
[08:47] just a cycle that just scales a lot. And
[08:50] I think um you now have influencers that
[08:54] are Bitcoin influencers, but there's a
[08:57] cohort that only cares about the
[08:59] technical side of things. Then there's
[09:01] another cohort that only cares about uh
[09:04] the energy, the environmental, and then
[09:07] there's another side that is only about
[09:09] regulatory policies and like the
[09:11] politics of Bitcoin. And then it's only
[09:13] the straight up number go up ETF uh more
[09:16] financial side and this goes from
[09:19] influencers to media outlets to TV
[09:23] channels to to everything. It's all
[09:25] fragmented in this little sections. So I
[09:27] feel like it's an interesting time to be
[09:29] alive because uh this fragmentation is
[09:32] kind of like here to stay and I think
[09:34] the next generation of new Bitcoiners
[09:36] that will understand Bitcoin and be
[09:38] Bitcoiners, I don't even know what that
[09:39] term means anymore. um they will just
[09:42] come in and purely understand Bitcoin
[09:44] from one perspective and then a whole
[09:47] another gang of group will understand
[09:49] Bitcoin from one perspective and then
[09:50] the some the total of all those
[09:53] splintered segments will be the Bitcoin
[09:56] community but they're going to be very
[09:59] different from each other and that might
[10:01] also you know turn into more narrative
[10:04] wars and and people disagreeing because
[10:06] they kind of like defend their own
[10:08] factions they defend their own beliefs
[10:09] and they it's kind of hard to move away
[10:12] from that established belief. So yeah,
[10:15] very interesting. Toby, what do you
[10:17] think uh about what I just said? Is is
[10:19] this somewhat aligned to to what you
[10:22] think? It it's super interesting because
[10:25] uh I've talked with uh almost 500 I
[10:29] think we have today 440 uh uh 493. So we
[10:33] are almost at 500 different guests and
[10:36] there are many different angles you can
[10:39] tackle Bitcoin. There is the as you said
[10:41] the economical. So like there's like two
[10:45] um very broad groups for like the more
[10:48] technical people that are really
[10:49] interested in in in in the technology in
[10:52] in mining in the sovereignty of it and
[10:55] the peer-to-peer aspect of it. And then
[10:57] there are uh people on the other side
[10:59] that are just really interested in
[11:01] number technic knowledge in the store of
[11:03] value. they often only have Bitcoin on
[11:05] ETFs or like just a part of it in
[11:08] selfcasio or maybe some exchange stuff
[11:10] like that. Uh and they they also more
[11:12] prone to uh buying micro strategy and
[11:15] buying derivative of of Bitcoin that
[11:17] might give them a leverage or yield on
[11:19] on top of Bitcoin. Um and then there is
[11:22] in those groups many different subgroups
[11:25] and you described this was a so
[11:26] wonderful um and it's it's one thing
[11:30] I've noticed that there's not a a one
[11:35] sizefits all solutions uh when it comes
[11:38] to orange building when it comes to
[11:39] narratives when it comes to anything of
[11:41] that because every person uh is is
[11:44] differently so for one person they are
[11:46] listening to Michael Sale they're like
[11:48] oh like he's so great like I now at
[11:50] Bitcoin. another person another person
[11:54] cannot even listen to him and they're
[11:56] listening to Peter Dot or or someone
[11:59] more technically Brown and they're like
[12:01] oh like now I get what Bitcoin actually
[12:03] is because we we have different
[12:06] perspectives and different angles and
[12:08] we're coming from a different uh
[12:09] background and we're needing um uh
[12:12] different uh those different properties
[12:16] uh of ourselves reflected in the story
[12:19] that we are being told and I think one
[12:21] thing we also touched on before we
[12:23] started recording is the
[12:27] decentralization of media houses. So
[12:29] like if you look back 20 30 years, it
[12:31] was a very different landscape. Now uh
[12:34] people like me that yeah I'm just alone
[12:36] with uh two free freelancers that help
[12:38] me part-time a little bit. Um uh and
[12:42] they all of the sudden have a voice and
[12:44] have uh sometimes hundreds of thousands
[12:46] of of listeners each month. So this is
[12:50] really big uh this this shift to
[12:53] individual smaller uh creators that all
[12:56] of a sudden have a pretty big voice and
[12:59] uh can be taken seriously. I I remember
[13:01] and I always bring the example up. Uh
[13:03] the early days of my Twitter journey was
[13:07] really cool because when I hit 300 400
[13:10] subscribers, a local newspaper reached
[13:13] out because one tweet got viral and they
[13:15] covered me with like a whole page in
[13:17] their uh economy um site and it was a
[13:20] nice article actually about Bitcoin
[13:22] which I didn't expect at all. Uh so
[13:26] there's just like you now have the
[13:28] possibility to be a random ple write one
[13:31] tweet a journalist sees it and they
[13:34] actually contact you and want to uh make
[13:36] a small article around that story that
[13:38] you tell. So the it's just amazing the
[13:41] the possibilities we have and how that
[13:44] impacts uh Bitcoin is is mind-blowing
[13:47] for me. Yeah. And you know this is
[13:50] something that has happened inside
[13:53] Bitcoin as well, right? like in the in
[13:55] the first few years of Bitcoin, I mean
[13:58] it was super centralized the
[14:00] communication it was Bitcoin talk and
[14:03] then a lot of if you ask somebody new to
[14:06] Bitcoin today uh about Bitcoin talk I
[14:09] would I would pretty confidently say
[14:11] that a majority of newcomers to Bitcoin
[14:14] today have never set foot have never
[14:17] typed bitcoin talk.org or in their
[14:19] browser ever. And from from that, you
[14:23] know, beginning then it started to
[14:25] spread out to to Reddit uh then to
[14:28] Bitcoin Twitter and now we have, you
[14:31] know, even even more stuff like Noster
[14:34] and uh so many other like French
[14:37] communities within the Bitcoin
[14:38] community. And then you have all the
[14:41] other non- Bitcoin outlets that have
[14:44] started to cover Bitcoin as well. And
[14:46] you know uh if you log into uh to the
[14:49] perception platform uh
[14:51] bitcoinperception.com and you start to
[14:53] look at just the volume you'll see that
[14:55] in the very beginning like my my
[14:58] platform goes all the way back to 2011.
[15:00] And it's just like a flat line. It's
[15:02] just like barely. And then you you you
[15:05] see the the Bitcoin price. You can in my
[15:07] platform you can compare the Bitcoin
[15:08] price with the volume and the the
[15:10] coverage um uh from from all these
[15:13] sources that I'm tracking. And it's just
[15:14] like the Bitcoin price
[15:17] helped the story and more outlets
[15:21] starting to pick up on that just just
[15:23] purely by price. So, you know, the meme
[15:26] of like, you know, you come for the NGU
[15:28] but you stay for the revolution is
[15:30] totally real because this is the story
[15:32] about Bitcoin that just keeps people
[15:34] coming back. And then, you know, if you
[15:37] heard a story about, oh, Bitcoin crashed
[15:40] 35%.
[15:41] uh you'll have a negative uh
[15:43] understanding of Bitcoin, but then a
[15:45] year later you see another story with
[15:47] Bitcoin just like you know up
[15:50] 230% and that might give you another
[15:53] chance to look at Bitcoin again. So it's
[15:56] like more of that decentralization has
[15:59] happened as the price has gone up and
[16:02] more and more outlets have started to
[16:04] cover Bitcoin as a result of that and
[16:07] then depending on the outlet that these
[16:09] people uh like what their ideology are
[16:13] or their their you know their their own
[16:16] beliefs are the kind of uh reporters
[16:18] that they
[16:19] employ their coverage will be a
[16:21] reflection of that. So you will see that
[16:24] the BBC has also picked up and started
[16:26] covering Bitcoin at at you know a very
[16:29] specific time when Bitcoin passed a
[16:31] certain price point. But their coverage
[16:34] has been extremely negative and almost
[16:36] exclusively negative since the very
[16:38] beginning and even in 2025 today their
[16:40] coverage is like insanely uh negative. I
[16:43] just did a Q1 report on bitcoin
[16:46] percepterception.com because I also do
[16:48] some research reports uh for my
[16:50] newsletter and uh in Q1 of this year in
[16:53] 2025 BBC had 40% negative uh coverage
[16:59] and zero positive in in in January,
[17:03] February and March of this year. You
[17:05] would think that Bitcoin has proven
[17:08] itself uh at this point, right? 16 years
[17:11] of uptime uh price is just you know is
[17:16] the best performing asset of the last
[17:17] decade etc etc. You would think they
[17:20] would at least consider another angle
[17:22] but they don't. So this is also
[17:24] something about the fragmentation that
[17:25] we're seeing is that uh a lot of new
[17:29] players uh or new outlets might start to
[17:33] cover uh Bitcoin but they have an agenda
[17:35] and their agenda is their bias. their
[17:38] bias is the reason that they have um
[17:42] accumulated an audience to begin with
[17:44] because their stories, their angles,
[17:47] their narratives attracts a certain type
[17:49] of people. So that when you get big
[17:52] enough, it's kind of like audience
[17:54] capture, you know, like when you get big
[17:55] enough, you need to keep telling these
[17:59] uh stories in order to keep that
[18:01] audience and maybe attract more of that
[18:03] audience that think the same. So at this
[18:05] point there are certain media outlets
[18:07] who can't ever publicly change their
[18:10] mind about Bitcoin because that would
[18:12] mean they will lose the audience or the
[18:14] readers or whatever that they have. But
[18:16] then what's interesting is that there
[18:18] are other outlets that are not that
[18:20] desperate I would say who have the
[18:22] luxury or the privilege to actually
[18:24] change their mind a little bit and start
[18:27] covering Bitcoin a little bit
[18:28] differently. And I see that with, you
[18:30] know, the financial outlets like
[18:32] Bloomberg, um, Forbes, uh, CNBC, stuff
[18:37] like that. Now, the interesting thing
[18:38] about those outlets is, okay, maybe they
[18:41] have a bad history. Like, if you look at
[18:43] their Bitcoin stories from 2016 or
[18:45] whatever, um, they're they're almost
[18:48] exclusively negative. And then you know
[18:50] once the ETF got approved and you know
[18:53] Larry Frink from Black Rockck all of a
[18:55] sudden became a Bitcoin proponent they
[18:57] started to change their tune as well.
[18:59] And Larry Frink also right like he was
[19:01] also he used to be negative about
[19:03] Bitcoin and then he became positive and
[19:04] started publicly uh you know uh doing
[19:07] the 180 uh saying that okay now Bitcoin
[19:10] is is is good in my opinion. And these
[19:13] are people who have the luxury uh to to
[19:16] pivot and to capture a new audience and
[19:18] maybe not think about uh like let's say
[19:21] in Larry Frink's uh position maybe they
[19:24] have a lot of like old school investors
[19:26] or just like investors who are like
[19:28] anti- bitcoin but they have enough
[19:30] volume they have enough size to be like
[19:34] hey we can take this pivot and attract
[19:36] an audience who is pro Bitcoin and then
[19:39] if these anti- bitcoiners who are part
[19:41] of our uh client list for example
[19:44] chooses to leave uh Black Rockck okay
[19:46] fine we can deal with that the upside
[19:48] the potential upside is bigger than
[19:50] whatever downside is but for the BBC for
[19:54] the the Guardian for these outlets who
[19:56] are really
[19:58] struggling they can't afford that they
[20:00] need to keep whatever little audience
[20:02] that they have left so that's why these
[20:05] narratives will never change and we
[20:07] should expect that and not be like oh
[20:09] man BBC again No, it's like you need to
[20:12] understand that these people will never
[20:13] change their their point of view because
[20:15] there's a deeper motivation behind it.
[20:18] And then uh the Bloombergs, the the
[20:20] Forbes, the CNBC's of the world who are
[20:23] now switching and covering Bitcoin
[20:27] positively, you need to be okay with the
[20:29] fact that they will only talk about
[20:32] Bitcoin in the terms of NGU and ETF
[20:35] inflows and stuff like that that maybe
[20:38] to you as a Bitcoiner is not Bitcoin
[20:40] enough, but we need to be acceptive of
[20:43] the fact that there will be fragments.
[20:46] will be factions of the fragmented media
[20:50] landscape who will cover Bitcoin
[20:52] positively but from a very narrow
[20:54] perspective and it's a narrow
[20:56] perspective because that's how they
[20:58] understand the world right like if you
[21:00] take a look at yourself and sorry for
[21:02] this rant but I have I have so many
[21:04] opinions about this feel free to just
[21:06] stop me if I go too long but in on an
[21:09] individual level you know we are busy
[21:12] people we got families we got jobs we
[21:14] got friends we got we got a lot stuff to
[21:16] do uh in the 16 hours a day that we are
[21:19] awake. So we can't really spend every
[21:23] single day learning new things and
[21:26] seeing things from a thousand
[21:27] perspectives to get a nuanced uh
[21:30] understanding of one topic, right? You
[21:33] do that with one topic and then you have
[21:34] to realize you need to do this with 50
[21:37] 60 topics. Uh you just your brain will
[21:39] explode, right?
[21:41] So us humans we we we we go into this
[21:45] like defense mechanism or like a
[21:47] survival instinct type of thing where we
[21:49] understand a few concepts enough for us
[21:52] to it makes sense to us. And then the
[21:55] combination of these like very simple,
[21:57] very narrow understandings of life is
[22:01] the lens that we will see life through
[22:04] that is making us able to uh live our
[22:10] life, take care of our family, have a
[22:12] job, build a career, whatever you want
[22:13] to do without going insane because
[22:16] there's just too much information.
[22:17] There's too much things to consider that
[22:19] you just can't. So you just have to pick
[22:21] your pick your side, pick your uh uh you
[22:25] know thought leaders, your influencers
[22:27] and just develop a very simple
[22:28] understanding of complex things at least
[22:31] to have some understanding of something
[22:32] and that is kind of like what these
[22:34] outlets are doing right so Bloomberg
[22:37] will be financial and that's their lens
[22:40] that they will cover Bitcoin through and
[22:42] we need to be cool with that. We can't
[22:44] be as Bitcoiners who've been in the game
[22:47] uh for a while. We can't say, "Ah, no,
[22:49] this is not how you're supposed to cover
[22:50] Bitcoin or this is not how you're
[22:53] supposed to use Bitcoin. No, this is the
[22:55] real Bitcoin. This is the fake Bitcoin."
[22:57] And I think this is something that one
[22:59] of my biggest problems with the Bitcoin
[23:01] community is is that we have all these
[23:04] pre preconceived notions of what Bitcoin
[23:07] is and what Bitcoin is not. And just
[23:10] because somebody else thinks differently
[23:12] about your beloved Bitcoin, uh, doesn't
[23:16] mean that they're wrong. They just
[23:17] they're just not aligned with your, uh,
[23:19] point of view. And that's okay. And I
[23:20] think we need to be okay with these
[23:22] things as Bitcoin continues to grow and
[23:24] adoption continues to grow. That is such
[23:26] a great point because um I I'm actually
[23:29] quite annoyed by that because I think
[23:32] Bitcoin is a mirror and we portray our
[23:35] own values onto Bitcoin and expect
[23:37] everyone else else also to have those
[23:39] values. Uh one very uh popular example
[23:43] is diet. Um, there are raw vegans in the
[23:48] Bitcoin community and there are raw
[23:50] carnivore people that eat like one meal
[23:53] a day, one steak a day. Uh, and they
[23:57] both uh love Bitcoin and they both
[24:00] completely are on a very different
[24:03] perspective on where where diet is. And
[24:06] I see it a lot like oh like the
[24:07] Bitcoiner has to eat meat, the Bitcoin
[24:09] like that's just not true. And you also
[24:12] said before like it's hard to um uh put
[24:16] a label on a Bitcoin and actually go
[24:18] ahead and always label a Bitcoiner the
[24:21] same way. A Bitcoin is someone who has
[24:23] Bitcoin or uses Bitcoin. Like that's
[24:26] that's it. All the other things is
[24:29] because we are humans and we put it on
[24:31] there and uh but it's it's not true.
[24:34] Like a Bitcoin is just someone that has
[24:36] or uses Bitcoin. I mean, we can even uh
[24:39] get it down to uses Bitcoin because if
[24:41] you just hold it, it's it's also a use
[24:42] case for me. So, uh Bitcoin is just
[24:45] someone that uses Bitcoin and nothing
[24:48] else. Everything else is just a
[24:50] narrative that we we spin in our head.
[24:53] Even though I know there is um and and
[24:56] there that might also be interesting.
[24:58] There's this how is it called Maya's
[25:01] personality uh tests and they have done
[25:04] it with the general population and with
[25:08] um bitcoiners I think like 3,000 or
[25:11] 4,000 bitcoiners or something like that
[25:13] um uh participated in and it's
[25:16] completely different. So those who in
[25:18] the general population aren't as uh
[25:20] common are very common in in the uh
[25:23] bitcoiner uh sphere. Uh so there are
[25:27] there is a certain personality type in
[25:29] Bitcoin but that doesn't mean that there
[25:31] are only those and it also doesn't mean
[25:34] that you have your values and then all
[25:36] of the other ones also have to behave
[25:38] the the same way. It's it's ridiculous
[25:42] for me. Yeah. No, it it is. And I think
[25:45] um it it it the fact that these like um
[25:49] stereotypes are still
[25:52] uh like clear in your mind and you can
[25:54] kind of like define it very well today
[25:57] goes to show how early we really are,
[25:59] right? Like if Bitcoin was way bigger
[26:01] than than it already is, it would have
[26:04] so many different people involved that
[26:06] all of these things would be blurred and
[26:08] not really that clear or not easy to
[26:10] define. But the fact that it is easy to
[26:12] define for you to for example break it
[26:15] down the stereotypes in terms of diet
[26:17] that means we're still early. this is
[26:19] still a very small small fraction of the
[26:22] global population in terms of like
[26:25] adoption, right? uh that we are still uh
[26:28] able to um uh to draw you know almost
[26:32] like caricatures of of different
[26:34] Bitcoiners uh stereotypical behaviors uh
[26:38] which is you know I guess it's good
[26:39] right because uh you know if you want to
[26:41] get into Bitcoin you know you want to
[26:43] get in as early as possible so it's a
[26:45] you know just another affirmation of how
[26:46] early we are in the in the entire uh
[26:49] adoption process uh in terms of uh
[26:51] having Bitcoin become a global a global
[26:55] asset Um but I do think that you know
[26:58] hey in the very beginning you are very
[27:00] susceptible to new information and
[27:02] there's there's a there's a there's a
[27:05] period in in the very in like the first
[27:08] touch points in your Bitcoin journey
[27:09] where you are very open for a lot of
[27:12] different information because at some
[27:15] point in the very beginning when you
[27:16] start to like get into Bitcoin you start
[27:18] to learn so many different things and
[27:20] you you start like realizing like holy
[27:23] man like there's a lot of stuff that I
[27:25] thought about the world that hm my
[27:27] worldview is kind of like getting
[27:28] crushed uh by the by the minute here. Um
[27:31] so you start asking questions about
[27:33] other things as well right like uh you
[27:35] know when you start realizing that you
[27:37] know you haven't really been taught
[27:39] about uh money um in the public school
[27:43] system you start asking okay what else
[27:46] haven't uh Ivy been taught about you
[27:48] know and you start to like distrust a
[27:50] lot of the previous narratives that you
[27:53] used to believe in and you kind like get
[27:55] into a you get into this cognitive
[27:59] vacuum where the old narratives that you
[28:03] used to believe in that was fed to you
[28:05] as a as a child, you realize now that
[28:08] it's not as valid anymore. But at the
[28:11] same time, we are humans and narratives
[28:13] is what drive us to make decisions to to
[28:16] move certain places to yeah make all the
[28:19] hundreds plus decisions that we have to
[28:21] make every day, right? So there's a
[28:23] vacuum of like old narratives I
[28:26] understand is it's a lot of stuff that I
[28:28] need to I need to replace but then what
[28:31] do I replace it with? So this vacuum
[28:33] becomes this like vulnerable state I
[28:36] would say where you might uh be
[28:40] convinced about Bitcoin's monetary
[28:42] properties by an influencers who also
[28:44] happens to be a carnivore and then
[28:46] you're like let me check out the
[28:48] carnivore stuff and then you know these
[28:51] kind of these things snowballs and
[28:52] that's the that's the power of
[28:54] influencers right because they get you
[28:56] through the door through one thing but
[28:58] then they might have other things that
[29:00] they are interested about right safe
[29:02] amuse one of you know sold you know over
[29:05] 1 million copies sold of the Bitcoin
[29:08] standard a lot of people understood
[29:10] Bitcoin through that book alone but then
[29:12] you start checking out say's Twitter and
[29:15] he's you know carnivore and there's a
[29:17] lot of other stuff that that is non
[29:18] Bitcoin related that he also keeps
[29:20] talking about and you're like okay maybe
[29:21] he has a point about this because he
[29:23] made a point about Bitcoin that I
[29:24] believe in so that's and and that's
[29:27] where I think personally this is
[29:30] something that I had to learn, you know,
[29:33] myself. I had to take myself out of that
[29:35] and say, "Listen, okay, things are going
[29:37] a little bit too crazy. You're starting
[29:39] to believe other things that are non
[29:42] Bitcoin by these other
[29:44] Bitcoiners, and you need to like really
[29:47] um you really need to be super critical
[29:49] to that new information flow because
[29:51] just because they're right about Bitcoin
[29:53] doesn't mean they're right about
[29:54] everything else." And I think that is
[29:56] very hard to do in the beginning when
[29:58] you're when you have this vacuum. like I
[30:00] said, and you and you want to like think
[30:03] differently, you want to see the world
[30:06] differently because Bitcoin has taught
[30:07] you so much. But there's a very I don't
[30:10] want to say dangerous, but yeah, it
[30:12] could potentially be dangerous if you if
[30:14] your body uh can't uh process eating uh
[30:18] meat for 30 straight days, then maybe it
[30:21] could be a a dangerous thing to do. So
[30:23] yeah, I think um it's easy to get
[30:25] carried away
[30:27] uh when it comes to uh Bitcoin because
[30:29] you have a lot of smart people saying a
[30:31] lot of smart things and uh but I think
[30:34] it's uh it's your own responsibility to
[30:39] uh to to create that filter and to uh be
[30:43] critical of new information that these
[30:46] influencers or these outlets are giving
[30:48] you uh and not and not not given the
[30:51] benefit of the doubt just because They
[30:52] they convince you about one thing which
[30:54] is Bitcoin. Does that make sense? Let's
[30:56] take a break for a moment and appreciate
[30:58] the beauty that Coin Vigilante has made
[31:02] with the Bitcoin watches. Those watches
[31:04] are the most amazing, the most elegant
[31:07] way of showing that you are a true
[31:10] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[31:12] dropped a completely new and amazing
[31:15] Genesis edition of their watch
[31:18] collections. You have the date of the
[31:20] first ever mined Bitcoin block in there
[31:24] and of course also the block height and
[31:26] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[31:29] the level of detail they put in in this
[31:32] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[31:34] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[31:38] down in the descriptions. I love those
[31:40] watches so so much. And now if you have
[31:43] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[31:46] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[31:48] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[31:50] to deal with that. The first way is you
[31:52] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[31:54] entry for you to get into the
[31:57] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[32:00] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[32:03] super simple and secure way. And if you
[32:06] check out the link in the description,
[32:08] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[32:11] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[32:14] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[32:17] partner in terms of how to get the most
[32:20] out of your sovereignty. They will
[32:22] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[32:25] that is perfect for your individual
[32:28] situation. They will show you how you
[32:30] can secure your own devices. Securing
[32:33] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[32:35] have to keep all your devices secure.
[32:38] One topic that is overlooked often is
[32:40] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[32:43] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[32:46] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[32:48] place already? And last but not least,
[32:50] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[32:52] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[32:55] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[33:00] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[33:03] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[33:05] be for the first time ever speaking at
[33:08] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[33:11] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[33:13] really looking forward to seeing all of
[33:15] you there. You can get your ticket in
[33:18] the link down in the description of
[33:20] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[33:22] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[33:26] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[33:28] there. Yeah, like Bitcoin is kind of uh
[33:30] an interesting intelligence test, but it
[33:33] doesn't it's not 100% uh quote like and
[33:38] you can still So just because someone is
[33:40] good in in in in discovering Bitcoin
[33:43] doesn't mean he's also good in all other
[33:45] aspects of of life. The the same way
[33:49] maybe an doctor is really good in saving
[33:51] lives, but he maybe doesn't understand
[33:54] Bitcoin. So uh like I think those skills
[33:58] don't transfer automatically which which
[34:01] is an interesting point. Um h how do you
[34:05] think as we are still a very small and
[34:08] early group and as we before uh uh said
[34:11] we can still do some kind of
[34:13] characteristics of what like the average
[34:15] Bitcoiner currently uh kind of looks
[34:18] even though it's not 100% but like if if
[34:20] we go with tendencies how do you think
[34:22] the general population will will look to
[34:25] um Bitcoiners that bought Bitcoin before
[34:28] 2026 in like 10 20 years and and and
[34:33] look back. I think like there's there's
[34:35] now an an shape of like real estate
[34:39] people that got like real estate for
[34:41] like free blueberries in 1950 and stuff
[34:44] like that. Um how do you think the
[34:47] general population will look at those
[34:49] early bitcoiners? I think uh my my
[34:53] my biggest wish is that they don't take
[34:55] a look and they just uh because I think
[34:58] it's kind of cringe. I think that and
[35:01] this is maybe because the the opera
[35:03] return debates is so fresh and it's
[35:05] happening right now and I am totally
[35:07] cringed out by the way these debates or
[35:11] discussion has happened. Um but I think
[35:14] that
[35:15] uh it all depends on where Bitcoin is in
[35:18] uh in 10 years from now because um if
[35:22] Bitcoin succeeds um all of us will be
[35:25] looked at uh pioneers. If Bitcoin
[35:28] doesn't succeed, we're going to be uh
[35:30] cast as naive ideologists who didn't
[35:34] know about the real world. So, it all
[35:36] depends on how this this thing
[35:39] eventually ends up being. But I think
[35:43] Bitcoin is going to win. I think Bitcoin
[35:46] is going to just keep continue to grow.
[35:49] Um but that's also I'm saying I'm
[35:52] confident and I'm saying this with all
[35:54] the information that we have up until
[35:56] today. I don't know what's going to
[35:57] happen in the future. I might change my
[35:59] mind about Bitcoin, but ever since I
[36:03] started my Bitcoin journey in 2017 and
[36:06] I've ride those waves and adoption
[36:09] cycles all the way to 2025 or mid 2025
[36:13] where we are today. I I've never been
[36:15] more bullish on Bitcoin. Uh a and I
[36:18] really see like you know my from my
[36:22] understanding of Bitcoin which is the
[36:24] monetary
[36:25] properties, the predictable issuance
[36:29] uh the cap and um uh how how Bitcoin is
[36:35] a savings technology and how savings
[36:37] technology
[36:38] uh is the catalyst for so many
[36:41] improvements in life. That's not only
[36:44] not not just because of Bitcoin, because
[36:46] of the the catalyst that Bitcoin
[36:49] represents in order for you know people
[36:52] who are poor who are forced to live
[36:54] dayto-day are now uh available are now
[36:58] um h they have now the possibility to
[37:00] plan ahead more than one day in the
[37:03] future. Just those things is extremely
[37:07] transformational and I don't think
[37:08] people realize the extent of how much
[37:12] that changes your whole perspective, how
[37:15] much that changes your life. You know,
[37:17] we're talking about stuff like you don't
[37:20] you can now earn money digitally and the
[37:23] hardest money ever
[37:25] created and you can be paid by anybody
[37:29] uh around the world, which means that
[37:33] you now have an appreciating asset that
[37:36] you can save in and plan for the future,
[37:38] but you don't have to leave your country
[37:40] or your family to go work in another
[37:42] country in order to get paid.
[37:46] So that is just insane. If that had
[37:49] existed back in 1989 when my mom had to
[37:52] make that choice, if Bitcoin existed at
[37:55] that time, we would have never left
[37:57] Argentina and Argentina would be more
[38:00] prosperous than it is today. Uh you
[38:02] know, this is just one example that I'm
[38:04] giving you. take that example and then
[38:06] extrapolate that into a thousandx
[38:09] uh across the entire world and just that
[38:13] is insane. Okay.
[38:17] Um and if things don't get drastically
[38:22] changed when it comes to the protocol to
[38:24] the consensus to to Bitcoin itself then
[38:28] yeah I I I truly believe we are going to
[38:31] be seen as visionaries as you know we we
[38:34] we we uh we were all playing a part in
[38:38] Bitcoin success and the world is a
[38:41] better place because of that in 2035 if
[38:44] things drastically change and all of a
[38:46] sudden, I don't know, there's a
[38:47] consensus around uh not having 21
[38:50] million uh as the cap, then you know, uh
[38:54] I'm going to stop believing Bitcoin and
[38:56] I think people looking back will will
[38:58] look at us as fools. So, yeah, I don't
[39:01] know if this is a a good question, but
[39:03] it was a really good question that
[39:04] you're posing though. It's uh it's a
[39:06] it's a it's a very interesting thought
[39:08] experiment.
[39:10] Do you see indicators uh from all those
[39:14] uh uh medias and narratives that that
[39:16] that you're seeing for the Bitcoin
[39:20] adoption going forward or is it is it
[39:23] like a leading or like more of a lagging
[39:26] indicator of like okay there's Bitcoin
[39:28] adoption happening and that's why media
[39:30] is is kind of reporting on it or is it
[39:32] maybe even the other way around where
[39:34] there's small media coverage and then
[39:36] this actually drives more adoption.
[39:39] Yeah, that's the that's the that's the
[39:40] whole reason I I created the Bitcoin
[39:42] perception platform because there's a
[39:44] big uh difference between what is being
[39:46] discussed in Stacker News on Reddit on X
[39:51] uh just take a few of the channels that
[39:53] I'm that I'm sourcing versus what is
[39:56] being covered in in the legacy media.
[39:58] two scenarios uh within that gap is the
[40:02] things that I get that gets discussed on
[40:04] Reddit, Stacker News X, whatever makes
[40:08] it to the legacy media. They're just not
[40:11] covering it. Nobody will know. It's just
[40:13] a fringe topic that stays within the the
[40:17] community of people who are more in tune
[40:21] uh with with what's happening at at
[40:23] Bitcoin on a daily basis. Uh but then
[40:26] the stuff that do get covered in the
[40:29] legacy media obviously comes way later
[40:32] than when it first started you know
[40:35] being discussed in in uh like the the
[40:38] base layer I would say of uh the the
[40:41] Bitcoin discussion which is the people
[40:43] which is which is the different players
[40:45] which are the the different founders of
[40:47] different companies and power users and
[40:49] influencers. That conversation is where
[40:51] it starts. And obviously in the middle
[40:54] you have crypto media, you have the, you
[40:57] know, the Cointelegraphs, the CoinDesk
[40:59] and stuff like that who constantly
[41:02] uh are looking at the conversations that
[41:04] are happening and they are obviously
[41:05] pretty good at picking up uh things that
[41:07] are getting momentum or things that are
[41:10] pretty interesting. Uh new proposals or
[41:13] uh new companies that are building
[41:14] something new, they cover that. in
[41:16] Legacy Media, they will never touch that
[41:18] unless uh these companies become
[41:22] public and or or raise a bunch of money
[41:25] or or or something like that. So, and
[41:28] that's okay. That's the flow. That's the
[41:30] information flow that goes between these
[41:32] like fragmented sets. Um they all have a
[41:37] they all have a connection to each
[41:38] other, but it's very fragmented. So,
[41:40] it's not very easy to see if you're only
[41:43] uh visiting uh uh your timeline on X or
[41:47] just visiting or like typing coindes.com
[41:50] on your browser and checking it out once
[41:51] in a while or uh uh I don't know uh
[41:54] seeing maybe some big influencer
[41:57] retweeting a video clip from CNBC about
[42:00] an interview that you might see. So
[42:02] that's why kind like I created uh the
[42:03] perception platform as well to just have
[42:06] everything in one place and to be able
[42:07] to see these uh these straight lines
[42:10] even though there's that line is going
[42:12] through a lot of fragmented sections of
[42:14] the overall uh discourse. Uh so yeah I
[42:18] and I think it's it's okay. I mean, you
[42:21] know, I think that the the the Bitcoin
[42:24] framing in legacy media, like mainstream
[42:27] financial outlets, uh, like I said, they
[42:30] see Bitcoin through a very specific lens
[42:33] that makes sense to them. So, it's going
[42:35] to be price, volatility, and then how
[42:38] Bitcoin is somewhat related to like
[42:40] macroeconomic trends. And I think just
[42:43] this narrow focus has actually helped uh
[42:47] with institutional adoption. Um but
[42:51] obviously it frames Bitcoin you know
[42:54] narrowly as a speculative asset. But as
[42:58] the media landscape overall continues to
[43:03] keep
[43:03] fragmenting, I think these narratives
[43:06] will diverge and some outlets will just
[43:08] double down on the oh, Bitcoin is risky
[43:11] or Bitcoin is volatile storyline to keep
[43:15] these legacy audiences engaged and then
[43:17] others will evolve to reflect Bitcoin's
[43:21] expanding utility. Now what what these
[43:24] utility like what these expanding
[43:26] utilities will be you know time will
[43:28] tell because things a lot of interesting
[43:30] stuff are being built and uh is going to
[43:33] be put to a test whether these things
[43:34] that are being built are actually being
[43:36] adopted right like I I talk if I put on
[43:39] my blogstream hat right now this is what
[43:42] we are doing in blogstream right like we
[43:44] are building what we believe is the
[43:47] future on Bitcoin rails and we are
[43:51] actively engaging people, prospects to
[43:56] uh integrate our technologies because we
[43:58] believe this is hyper bitcoinization
[44:01] looks a very certain way and you need to
[44:04] build a lot of the a lot of the utility
[44:08] that you see in traditional finance. You
[44:10] need to build that on Bitcoin rail but
[44:12] you got to make it better. So that's the
[44:15] bet, that's the risk, that's kind of
[44:17] like what we are building towards. And I
[44:19] it's it's it's a nice there's a nice
[44:22] relationship between adoption of new
[44:25] technology and the media who covers that
[44:28] technology and its users. So it's super
[44:31] interesting to be a marketer or
[44:32] communications person uh at Blockstream
[44:35] at this very moment as well because uh
[44:39] you need to know the institutional lens.
[44:42] You need to understand why financial
[44:43] outlets are covering Bitcoin as NGU. You
[44:46] also need to understand uh the
[44:49] fragmentation effect like how different
[44:51] audiences will see different narratives
[44:54] and be okay with that. And then you also
[44:57] need to understand like the
[44:59] inevitability of polarized Bitcoin
[45:02] narratives and why that's not
[45:04] necessarily bad.
[45:07] Interesting. Because you brought it up.
[45:09] H how do you think hyper
[45:11] bitcoinization looks like? How do how do
[45:13] you how do you see that? Does that mean
[45:15] that everyone is into bitcoin? Like is
[45:18] is that a requirement for for hyper
[45:20] bitcoinization? Uh I think hyper
[45:22] bitcoinization is kind of like hyper
[45:24] fiatization where you just do stuff and
[45:27] you don't really know or understand how
[45:29] fiat money works. It's just the value
[45:32] that you're transmitting and you have a
[45:36] understanding of that value and you have
[45:38] no idea whether the institution that
[45:41] are lending you money or the the the the
[45:45] the corporations that are uh custody of
[45:49] your money. You don't you don't
[45:51] understand like I mean 99% of people uh
[45:54] Bitcoiners excluded they have no idea
[45:56] about these things, right? Like uh
[45:59] people still to this day, they go to the
[46:01] bank and they ask, "Hey, I want to take
[46:03] out 2,500 bucks and they are shocked
[46:06] when they're like, "Oh, we you can't do
[46:08] that." Or uh they say, "Okay, we can do
[46:11] it in 48 hours. You just need to fill 17
[46:14] pages of paperwork first." They're
[46:15] shocked by that because they have no
[46:17] idea how the system works. And I think
[46:21] hyper bitcoinization
[46:23] um is still going to offer the same
[46:26] things. There's still going to be
[46:28] lending. There's still still going to be
[46:30] uh borrowing. There's still going to be
[46:32] um you know private loans being issued.
[46:35] There's still going to be equities being
[46:37] issued uh and people buying stock into
[46:41] um companies. So a lot of these
[46:44] financial instruments that have existed
[46:46] for a while, I don't think they're going
[46:47] to go away in a hyper bitconized future.
[46:50] The only difference is, which I think is
[46:52] the main difference, is Bitcoin is going
[46:54] to be the underlying technology. It's
[46:57] going to be the underlying protocol and
[46:59] it's going to be the underlying asset.
[47:01] So if you get a fiat loan, the
[47:04] collateral is
[47:06] Bitcoin. I like that collateral way more
[47:08] than other types of collateral. So,
[47:11] uh, it's just about it's not about like
[47:14] breaking down the system. It's about
[47:16] just making it more efficient and and
[47:18] improving on the things that needs to
[47:20] improve. And I think having the hardest
[47:23] money uh as the underlying asset and
[47:28] that can also serve as the protocol. I
[47:31] mean, that's going to change the world,
[47:32] man. It's the same example that I that I
[47:35] talked about 10 minutes ago about one
[47:37] person being able to charge uh a service
[47:42] in Bitcoin and just by the fact that
[47:45] this person is getting the hardest money
[47:48] ever uh now has a chance to uh plan
[47:52] ahead and actually save in Bitcoin. Uh
[47:56] that that makes a huge difference. It's
[47:58] a simple transaction done on Bitcoin
[48:00] with Bitcoin, but it's so
[48:02] transformational just because of the the
[48:04] nature the properties of the asset and
[48:06] the properties of the protocol that it's
[48:09] going to be life-changing. And I think
[48:10] the same thing when you scale up to, you
[48:13] know, Tradfy, Legacy Finance, just the
[48:16] fact that they connect that they
[48:18] integrate Bitcoin is is going to make
[48:20] their services so much better and more
[48:21] efficient. So, I think that's a that's
[48:24] how hyper Bitcoin looks to me at least.
[48:27] is super interest. It's it's uh there
[48:30] are so many um great narratives and you
[48:32] just brought us a really really good
[48:35] one. I like that narrative of the
[48:37] individual and what it brings him in the
[48:40] actual day-to-day life like not not just
[48:43] like some numbers and like oh like your
[48:45] inflation and and this and that like
[48:47] like what actually does it mean? Do you
[48:50] have and and maybe this is the the
[48:51] narrative that you just brought to us,
[48:53] but do you have a like a personal
[48:55] favorite Bitcoin narrative that that
[48:57] you're like, okay, if we all hammer that
[48:59] down, we'll will come quicker to the bit
[49:02] hyper bitcoinization. Yeah, I think um I
[49:05] think uh honestly I think we need to if
[49:08] I had to choose one thing and and it's
[49:10] going to be a little bit biased because
[49:12] um I I I I
[49:15] I have uh been uh stacking Bitcoin since
[49:19] 2017. So I have a survivor bias, right?
[49:22] It's not as easy to say what I'm about
[49:24] to say for someone who just entered and
[49:27] might go through a bare market in the
[49:29] next 6 to 12 months. Who knows? But
[49:33] savings, Bitcoin as a savings technology
[49:36] I think is the number one thing because
[49:41] um the the concept of saving money is
[49:45] somewhat easy to to understand. It's
[49:48] easy to understand why the money that
[49:50] you get today, you should not spend
[49:52] everything right away and try to save a
[49:55] portion of that every single day. So you
[49:57] you grow a bigger stack of money that
[50:00] you can then uh use in the future for
[50:05] any choices that you want to make. So
[50:07] you are not forced to make any choice.
[50:10] It's a choice that is deliberate and
[50:12] voluntary because you have the power,
[50:14] you have the opportunity through savings
[50:16] to make choices and not let someone else
[50:19] do make the choice for you. So I think
[50:23] that is way way more uh it's easier to
[50:28] teach than saying stuff about this is
[50:31] how peer-to-peer works. This is what
[50:34] decentral this decentralization means.
[50:37] Oh, this is SHA 256. This is space 58.
[50:40] Let me sit you down. Let's go and read
[50:42] the white paper together and let's talk
[50:45] about cryptography and why that is
[50:46] important. Let's talk about mining and
[50:48] why uh mining is so important. Um I
[50:52] think just savings. Bitcoin is a hard
[50:55] asset because it's um its
[50:59] circulation new units being made every
[51:02] day is uh predictable. You already know
[51:05] what's going to happen. there's no
[51:07] central committee that are deciding oh
[51:09] today we're going to just print 21
[51:11] million today and which in effect
[51:13] dilutes the value of the money that
[51:15] you're saving. So if we can get that, if
[51:19] we can get people to gro that, then
[51:21] that's a super important aspect,
[51:23] especially in Latin America or the
[51:26] global south or whatever you want to
[51:28] call it, the third world, where the
[51:30] concept of saving is almost non-existent
[51:33] because people are forced to just use
[51:35] all the money that they get in every day
[51:37] in order to cover basic uh basic needs.
[51:40] So in terms of like what is the easiest
[51:44] concept that also has the biggest
[51:46] transformational effect, I think Bitcoin
[51:49] as
[51:50] savings, cold storage and just hold it,
[51:54] keep accumulating and just do that for
[51:56] for years um is the one thing that will
[52:00] lead us the fastest to hyperconization.
[52:02] everything else. And I'm sorry, but like
[52:05] how to run a node, how um how uh proof
[52:09] of work works, uh
[52:11] cryptography, um all of that stuff is
[52:14] just not going to get people faster to
[52:19] having Bitcoin and believing in Bitcoin.
[52:21] So yeah, savings technology for the win.
[52:24] Absolutely. I I see that with the data
[52:26] on on my YouTube analytics also. That's
[52:28] what people uh that's what people like
[52:31] to to see and click on.
[52:33] Um especially um when we look outside
[52:38] because in in the western world
[52:40] sometimes it's it's almost seem outside
[52:42] of Bitcoin a little bit of a a luxury
[52:44] good Bitcoin. I hear that from my
[52:46] family. Oh, like you have to have a lot
[52:48] of money to get Bitcoin because like you
[52:50] have to have real estate and and stocks
[52:52] and then only then you can also
[52:54] diversify in in Bitcoin.
[52:57] um which is a really weird narrative but
[53:00] uh it it definitely exists. Uh and I see
[53:03] that a little bit less uh from people
[53:05] that that that come from Argentina,
[53:07] Latin America, Turkey, from from other
[53:10] parts of the world where inflation is
[53:11] just uh a lot more crazy. Um how does it
[53:16] how does it for for you
[53:19] you how have you been you've been born
[53:22] in in Argentina, right? How long have
[53:24] you been in in Argentina? No, I mean I
[53:26] my mom immigrated when I was a kid, but
[53:28] I I always went back to visit families.
[53:31] I've always maintained a good connection
[53:33] to uh to Argentina. Yeah. So, how was uh
[53:38] growing up there with and we we had
[53:40] actually I think one or two podcasts,
[53:43] probably two podcasts uh where we um
[53:47] brought down and and and broke down the
[53:50] how Argentina got a newer uh currency,
[53:53] then this broke down and then new
[53:55] currency and then all those those
[53:56] different iterations like in in a one
[53:58] two hour video really nicely. Uh uh but
[54:02] it's really interesting to hear from you
[54:04] how was it to to see that firsthand
[54:06] because I only saw it only from like
[54:08] other people explaining it to me. Well,
[54:12] it kind of like um accelerates a lot of
[54:15] bad decisions uh for the for the
[54:19] individual because if you have any
[54:21] savings, if you have any assets, uh you
[54:24] are essentially being forced to sell
[54:25] them off in order to cover expenses. If
[54:28] you are a business owner, for example,
[54:30] and you need to pay people a salary, uh
[54:33] you can only raise your prices on the
[54:35] menu for that much before you completely
[54:38] lose your your clientele and you need to
[54:41] try to get cash flow from elsewhere in
[54:44] order to cover all business expenses. So
[54:46] in my particular um situation, my dad
[54:50] who used to um the height of of his
[54:53] success, he had about five restaurants
[54:56] open at the same time, several cars and
[54:59] and and and and several properties. And
[55:02] you just sell one after one after one
[55:05] after one just to get cash flow to to um
[55:08] um to support all all your all your
[55:11] costs to to be in business. And then it
[55:13] goes to a point where as hyperinflation
[55:17] accelerates, you accelerate the sell off
[55:20] of these assets and then you spend all
[55:23] the money that that sell the the the
[55:26] selling of those assets gave you and you
[55:28] ended up with nothing as hyperinflation
[55:30] continues from that point on. And then
[55:33] you're just like, okay, I got to close
[55:34] up. I can't maintain a business and and
[55:38] you're done. And that's just one example
[55:40] from my family. Imagine all business
[55:43] owners that that had a business at any
[55:46] level, successful or not, uh during that
[55:48] time. And uh you didn't say the
[55:52] um you didn't say the period uh for your
[55:56] podcast episode, but I can imagine this
[55:58] was the period after 1983 to 1989 cuz in
[56:02] 1993 Argentina came out of a military
[56:04] dictatorship or like democracy came back
[56:07] uh after 1976 to 1983 of being like a
[56:11] centralized authoritarian military
[56:13] dictatorship where you couldn't have
[56:15] elections.
[56:17] 83 came and um uh the new president, the
[56:23] new government, they kind of like wanted
[56:24] to change a lot of things. So they did
[56:27] uh you know some very dubious obviously
[56:30] in in hindsight very dubious uh choices
[56:33] like moving the capital from Buenosidis
[56:35] to a place called Vietma um and then
[56:38] changing uh the the currency to
[56:41] something called Astral. They had no
[56:43] clue what they were doing essentially.
[56:45] And after introducing that currency, you
[56:48] started to see 5,000 uh bills, 10,000
[56:52] bills, 20,000 bills kind of just kept
[56:55] adding zeros to those uh notes just to
[56:58] keep up with inflation, right? And uh it
[57:01] came to a point where that currency uh
[57:03] crashed. Uh the capital was returned
[57:07] from Vietnam to Bonitis in that lapse of
[57:10] 1983 to 1989. those six years. Can't
[57:14] even remember how many zeros we added to
[57:16] the currency, but just like a bunch. And
[57:20] 1989 was essentially the the the year
[57:24] that my mom chose to to immigrate. So it
[57:26] was like she she had enough and at the
[57:28] very tail end she decided to uh to
[57:30] immigrate to Norway. Then in 1989, a new
[57:34] president came in and he he did uh he he
[57:38] he he essentially converted uh back to
[57:41] the peso and had a policy um that had
[57:45] some control controlled inflation at
[57:48] least didn't it wasn't as rampant. And
[57:51] then um they had a lot of reserve assets
[57:54] as well. And uh for the entire decade of
[57:57] the '90s, one Argentine peso was
[58:00] equivalent to one US dollar. And that
[58:03] stability just was enough for people to
[58:06] now be able to plan, go on vacation,
[58:09] enjoy life more, buy some assets, just
[58:13] essentially um the middle class felt
[58:17] like a real middle class. Um and people
[58:20] had more purchasing power and uh things
[58:22] were better. It was a better time
[58:24] looking back. Uh but then you know uh at
[58:27] at the at the millennia at at you know
[58:29] in 1999 2000 and 2001 there's a lot of
[58:32] different crisises in in the world you
[58:34] know and uh specifically in Mexico there
[58:37] was a crisis called the tequila crisis
[58:39] uh which was essentially a reserve
[58:41] currency crisis that started in Mexico
[58:43] and had like a ripple effect throughout
[58:45] Latin America that also broke this
[58:47] one-on-one peg uh down and that
[58:51] kickstarted more
[58:52] inflation. people who had um dollars
[58:56] saved in the bank, uh the the the bank
[59:00] essentially forced you to exchange those
[59:04] dollars into the local currency that was
[59:06] inflating away. So, if you had 10,000,
[59:08] let's say $10,000 in savings, you were
[59:11] forced to get it back in pesos and then
[59:13] at the end of this whole um this whole
[59:17] um uh process, it was maybe worth $3,000
[59:20] uh US. So again, you know, once again,
[59:24] the Argentine people had to become the
[59:27] victim of this unfortunate monetary
[59:31] policies that continued, I would say,
[59:35] all the way to when Malay became
[59:37] president. uh because apart of just you
[59:41] know bad market momentum or whatever you
[59:44] want to call it there's also a cultural
[59:45] aspect when it comes to
[59:47] Argentina where the political class they
[59:51] use the money spigot to buy favors to uh
[59:56] to pay off people to not riot um it's a
[60:00] very antiquated model uh that is very
[60:03] resemblant to how Europe was in the
[60:07] 1920s like right after the industrial
[60:10] revolution with like the ad the the the
[60:13] the advent of unions
[60:16] uh all these labor laws and and and um
[60:20] uh basically all these mafias all these
[60:22] like groups that were like so-called uh
[60:25] in favor of the workers interest
[60:28] uh essentially created these uh these
[60:33] scam
[60:35] essentially these these
[60:36] rackets um just to have power and to be
[60:40] aligned with uh politicians uh to remain
[60:45] in power and that is mostly um mostly
[60:50] something that was uh perpetuated by the
[60:54] Peranism uh
[60:56] movement and perinism is you know named
[60:59] after Peron which was is one of the most
[61:02] influential presidents in Argentine
[61:03] history. He was like a general very
[61:07] right-wing uh military general who took
[61:10] a lot of the communist ideas and
[61:12] socialist ideas kind of like made a very
[61:16] powerful package
[61:18] um to essentially take power in the
[61:23] 1940s all through the 70s and his legacy
[61:26] is still perpetuated as an ideology by
[61:30] today's uh leftwing of the Argentine uh
[61:33] government and They all have they just
[61:36] still use that formula. Print a lot of
[61:39] money, pay off all these syndicate this
[61:41] the syndicates and the and the unions
[61:44] and then have like this like power
[61:46] vacuum that nobody else from the outside
[61:48] can really can really penetrate because
[61:50] they you just have to be an insider in
[61:53] order to to uh you know enjoy the fruits
[61:55] of the power. And then you know until
[61:57] MLE came and and kind of like broke that
[62:00] vacuum uh through the use of internet
[62:03] and the use of narratives uh by becoming
[62:06] this like TV personality
[62:09] uh this guy who was able to distill a
[62:11] lot of complex ideas like Austrian
[62:14] economics who usually is a very academic
[62:17] thing and that is you know the reason
[62:19] why a lot of people don't really
[62:20] understand Austrian economics too much
[62:22] because it's all a bunch of academia uh
[62:24] lingo that people don't really
[62:26] understand, right? Mle took all of that,
[62:29] took the ideas and distilled it. He syn
[62:31] synthesized it into a way that was very
[62:33] easy for people to understand, became
[62:35] viral, all internet fueled them to
[62:38] really spread the message and eventually
[62:41] led him to be the president of Argentina
[62:43] and in power a year and a half later has
[62:46] curbed inflation. U right so um um well
[62:51] that is Argentina in a nutshell. there's
[62:53] a big cultural problem that is
[62:55] underlying all like political uh
[62:58] political flavors or political uh
[63:02] factions that gets created and
[63:04] ideologies that keeps on living. Uh but
[63:06] I you know I'm very I'm very positive
[63:08] that Malay is able to at least change
[63:10] the cultural thing because
[63:15] uh keeping up with a lot of political
[63:17] promises is difficult and takes a lot of
[63:20] time because you have to you have to do
[63:21] a lot of uh compromise and you need to
[63:24] broker a lot of deals essentially. But
[63:27] culture is something that you can change
[63:30] today if you start with the narratives
[63:33] that are easy to digest and you just
[63:36] repeat them over time and you make sure
[63:38] that you have enough distribution.
[63:40] uh then you know in a 4-year cycle which
[63:43] is the cycle that he will be uh
[63:45] president if he's able to turn the tide
[63:48] and actually have young people think in
[63:51] Austrian uh instead of thinking in
[63:55] socialist then I think that's a huge
[63:57] improvement for Argentine society as a
[64:00] whole because it starts with culture it
[64:03] starts with narratives everything else
[64:05] is is just um downstream from the way
[64:09] you think and the way you see the world.
[64:10] So hopefully Malay is going to change
[64:12] that in the three years that he has
[64:15] left. That's super interesting. So he
[64:18] has three years uh left and and he has
[64:20] been now two years in 3 years in what
[64:22] what was Yeah. Yeah. I mean maybe year
[64:24] and a half. So yeah he has two and a
[64:26] half uh years left something like that.
[64:28] Okay. Super interesting. Yeah. Mle is I
[64:32] mean uh he he went through uh the phase
[64:36] of being extremely popular in in the
[64:37] Bitcoin uh ecosystem. then with like uh
[64:41] some controversies but I think
[64:43] he at least I hope he really understands
[64:47] this uh free market dynamics and just
[64:49] wants to have a free competition between
[64:51] all currencies and I think in any free
[64:54] competition around currencies and assets
[64:57] bitcoin will win. Uh so for me I like
[65:00] that appro there's an argument to be
[65:03] made that that approach is better than
[65:06] what the US US is currently doing with
[65:08] uh buying Bitcoin for an individual
[65:10] person because I personally like uh ple
[65:13] and individuals have bitcoin and not
[65:15] nation states uh and I just want to have
[65:17] the nation state to make the rule that
[65:20] competition is possible and let the
[65:23] individual and free market decide what's
[65:25] best because they know what's best and
[65:28] Uh I I'm I'm really looking forward to
[65:30] how Argent Argentina
[65:33] um is setting up in the next few years
[65:36] is setting up then uh with a new
[65:38] president potentially. I don't know if
[65:40] he can be reelected or or he can Okay.
[65:44] So hopefully he gets reelected and if
[65:46] they continue this p path, how does
[65:49] Argentina look like in 10 20 years? They
[65:53] they they could
[65:54] potentially be a big
[65:57] country, a big big big one, and be a
[66:01] positive role model, positive example of
[66:03] how you get from bad to to basically
[66:06] good uh with some radical changes. But
[66:10] it's not as easy. So, I'm really looking
[66:12] forward if if Argentina can be that
[66:14] example. I mean, the the the arc of
[66:16] Argentina is from good to bad and then
[66:19] potentially good. So, it's not going to
[66:21] be from bad to good, but you have to
[66:23] step back and see how Argentina was when
[66:26] Argentina um you know was was really
[66:29] built, right? Like it's uh um you have a
[66:32] parallel history here with the US and um
[66:35] and Argentina uh in the sense of
[66:38] Europeans uh immigrating from Europe and
[66:42] going on boats and essentially going
[66:45] either to New York City or to Bonositis,
[66:47] right? And um and what's common for both
[66:51] countries at the same time is that these
[66:53] immigrants, they came uh with their
[66:56] families, you know, they spent all their
[66:58] money on that one ticket, one way. There
[67:01] was no turning back. And people were
[67:03] determined to actually make whatever
[67:05] country they were going to great, right?
[67:08] They were opening businesses. If they
[67:10] didn't open businesses, they were
[67:11] working. They were helping other people
[67:13] build their businesses. And all of that
[67:16] had like a a net positive effect because
[67:18] you essentially let the free market in.
[67:22] Uh you know you are kind of like uh
[67:24] trying to sell things on very fertile
[67:27] land but nothing is a guarantee. So you
[67:29] took a risk uh but it essentially paid
[67:32] off because everybody was like in on it.
[67:34] You know it was like here we are and we
[67:36] are here to build a nation type of
[67:39] mentality. And then you know the US just
[67:43] became a success based on that mentality
[67:47] and were able uh to keep that mentality
[67:50] going. And you can maybe see now that
[67:53] that idea of America being a little bit
[67:57] kind of like you know watered out or
[67:59] kind of breaking a little bit into
[68:01] pieces maybe. But in Argentina
[68:03] definitely broke into pieces and that
[68:06] and that was a cultural phenomenon,
[68:07] right? That was a thing where um all
[68:11] these how can I say all these ideas that
[68:15] the Europeans
[68:16] uh were escaping from because they were
[68:19] escaping you know the Spanish civil war,
[68:22] World War I and two was like a lot of
[68:24] political instability in Europe at that
[68:26] time, right? Uh which led to you know
[68:28] poverty and you know impossible working
[68:31] uh environments that led them to to
[68:34] leave. But all of that was because it
[68:36] was a big battle, a political
[68:37] ideological battle between left and
[68:40] right. It was fascism versus communism.
[68:42] And and unfortunately uh the immigrants
[68:45] who came to
[68:46] Argentina and the US, they took that
[68:49] with them. And you had the same
[68:51] communist versus fascist battles in the
[68:53] US in the early uh 20th century uh in in
[68:57] Argentina and the US. Now the what
[69:00] happened in Argentina is that the
[69:02] communists the the the leftist with
[69:04] Peron who had fascist tendencies but it
[69:08] was more uh he was
[69:12] more communist in terms of being a a
[69:15] very hardcore left-wing populist. Okay.
[69:19] He took over and laid the foundation for
[69:22] what you saw as the acceleration of the
[69:25] destruction of Argentina, which is you
[69:27] centralize power, you make the you make
[69:30] the government as big as possible, the
[69:32] government has to have a a a part in
[69:34] everything that happens in the economy.
[69:36] And when the culture is rotten from
[69:39] within, that centralized power means,
[69:42] hey, if you want to do something, you
[69:43] got to pay me. If you want to open up a
[69:46] business, you have to pay me. If you
[69:48] want to have your business kept open,
[69:51] you got to pay me every month, every
[69:53] year, every whatever. It's it's a
[69:55] racket. It's exactly like the mafia.
[69:57] It's like alapone just in
[70:01] systemized in a government uh package.
[70:05] And that culture has led Argentina down
[70:09] uh to this path. So, uh, uh, you know,
[70:12] hopefully, uh, uh, MLE again, uh, can
[70:16] can can fix this, but it's it's just so
[70:19] much easier to destroy something than to
[70:21] build it. So, uh, we looking at decades
[70:25] of
[70:27] destruction. And, uh, it's going to take
[70:29] double, triple the time to build it
[70:31] back. Uh, but you got to start
[70:33] somewhere. And hopefully, Melee is the
[70:34] is the start of that. I hope so, too.
[70:38] Um, and it it's the time flew completely
[70:41] by. We're already at uh 1 hour and 10
[70:43] minutes. That's fascinating. Um, I have
[70:46] a bunch of more topics, but I think with
[70:49] with the first round, we'll leave it at
[70:50] that. We have one question that I asked
[70:53] each and every one of my guests. And the
[70:54] question is, what can we learn from you
[70:57] besides Bitcoin? Oh man. Uh, nothing.
[71:00] Don't don't listen to me. Don't don't
[71:01] believe anything I say. Make up your own
[71:03] mind uh about about everything. But no
[71:06] um I think
[71:08] um somebody like me uh my experience in
[71:12] life is um again I've been working with
[71:16] disruptive technology. I've seen how
[71:19] technology can shape
[71:22] uh uh a whole society uh through
[71:26] cultural moments through uh ease of use
[71:29] of things that just make your life
[71:32] easier. And if I say that the the the
[71:36] the landscape
[71:38] today mirrors the music industry that I
[71:40] was part of when torrenting and
[71:43] streaming kind of upended legacy power
[71:45] structures. Believe me when I say that
[71:48] everything else is changing. It's not
[71:50] only about Bitcoin or anything like
[71:52] that. uh you will see so many
[71:54] institutions nowadays that are going to
[71:56] struggle to survive and they are going
[71:59] to attempt to buy up the smaller more
[72:04] agile players and this is like from
[72:07] businesses to influencers to small
[72:09] outlets to everything. um they're going
[72:12] to try to do that but because they
[72:14] understand that they can't reverse the
[72:16] shift uh right now. Uh media outlets,
[72:20] financial uh companies, uh governments,
[72:24] politicians, they're all facing the same
[72:26] crisis now. They're losing control of
[72:28] narratives as independent creators and
[72:32] decentralized platforms and niche
[72:34] communities are like gaining uh power.
[72:37] The difference this time is that
[72:39] creators can now monetize directly using
[72:43] Bitcoin. Uh, but it's also so easy to do
[72:47] everything yourself with AI, with tools
[72:50] that really can do a lot of stuff for
[72:52] you as one person. And I think that the
[72:55] difference now is that those people who
[72:57] want to be bought up are not going to
[72:59] want to sell because you can perfectly
[73:01] make $10,000 a month as a solo creator
[73:04] if you just figure out uh the variables
[73:08] where you have the combination of
[73:10] audience distribution and a very clear
[73:13] narrative that is a differentiator. and
[73:16] you solve a very important problem and
[73:19] that is extremely exciting for the
[73:21] future even though it can feel a little
[73:22] bit scary but I think one thing to learn
[73:26] from me is be grateful that you're
[73:28] living in 2025 and are able to sit at
[73:30] the front row uh seat for everything
[73:32] that is going to change drastically in
[73:34] the next few years. So yeah, that would
[73:36] be it. That that's that's a great one
[73:39] and uh I always say what a time to be
[73:41] alive in in 95 and what a time to be
[73:44] alive in the forefront of the Bitcoin
[73:46] revolution. It's it's crazy that we have
[73:48] the privilege to do that. Um we have an
[73:50] end routine in the podcast where the
[73:52] previous guest is asking a question for
[73:54] the next guest without knowing who the
[73:55] next guest actually is. And the previous
[73:57] guest asked you the question, what's the
[74:00] biggest Bitcoin related mistake you have
[74:02] ever made? believing in uh spending
[74:04] Bitcoin instead of saving it. Yeah, I I
[74:07] I guess I I make that mistake
[74:09] unfortunately a lot because I'm 100% in
[74:11] Bitcoin.
[74:14] Yeah. No, for sure. That is true. But as
[74:16] uh somebody from Argentina can tell you
[74:18] that everybody knows if you live in a
[74:20] hyperinflationary environment, the money
[74:23] that you spend is the weakest. You spend
[74:25] that first. You don't spend the
[74:26] strongest. The strongest you save. And
[74:29] that's that is how the mind shift
[74:32] happens. you know, the the the the the
[74:34] weakest money is the one that gets
[74:35] distributed first. That's just how it
[74:37] is. And I think a lot of people if they
[74:40] me myself included, I I was paid in
[74:43] Bitcoin back in 2017 and I paid my rent
[74:45] for it and stuff like that. Uh if I did
[74:48] not do that, I would be, you know, in in
[74:51] a in a better position today. So, it's
[74:53] just uh save for the future, spend the
[74:56] weak money for now. That's it. I love
[75:00] that. Really cool. Thank you so much,
[75:01] Fernando. Before we um uh before I let
[75:05] you go, where can people find you, ask
[75:06] you questions, and reach out to you?
