[00:00] I love Peter Schiff 99% of everything he
[00:02] says right but obviously we know he's
[00:04] wrong about Bitcoin either this guy is
[00:06] the best marketer in the world and he
[00:07] just wants to be the villain of Bitcoin
[00:10] or he's just an idiot he's done a big
[00:11] disservice to a lot of people whether
[00:13] he's doing it on purpose or not take a
[00:15] Bitcoin class go to bitcoin University
[00:17] there is just nobody that ever said oh I
[00:20] wish I would have bought less Bitcoin
[00:22] again you can see the evolution of money
[00:23] you got the seashells you got the salt
[00:25] you got the precious metals here then
[00:27] you have the cash then you have the
[00:28] credit cards and the final one the final
[00:30] boss would the be is Bitcoin there's a
[00:32] really big deflationary Force that's
[00:35] driving down prices without that
[00:37] deflationary Force we would have already
[00:39] inflation of like 50 60% probably higher
[00:41] than that another lie they told us is
[00:43] that our pensions are going to be there
[00:44] our social security is going to be there
[00:46] and a lot of these companies are not
[00:47] going to give you a pension a lot of the
[00:48] governments a lot of people are saying
[00:50] Social Security is going to run out in
[00:51] the 2030s for me the US dollar is like
[00:54] the mother of all fear coins they
[00:56] were cooking a slow and a pot of water
[00:58] like frogs we want to be the leader of
[01:00] the world we got to buy some more
[01:01] Bitcoin the first country to print money
[01:03] to buy Bitcoin
[01:04] [Music]
[01:08] wins you you're doing Satoshi Saturday
[01:11] and you're doing now really a lot of
[01:13] videos and I love love that and our
[01:15] video actually our interview comes
[01:17] together because one of one of my
[01:21] subscribers uh commented on my video hey
[01:24] you have to bring on Cherry uh loves
[01:27] freedom on your show and I let's let's
[01:29] see who who he is I was like ah perfect
[01:31] I love it saw one video and I was like
[01:34] uh reaching out to you uh what what did
[01:36] inspire you to like get started with
[01:38] content creation get started with
[01:40] speaking your mind on the internet and
[01:42] with satosi Saturday well first of all
[01:44] thank you to him for doing that to
[01:46] reaching out for you I really appreciate
[01:48] that and also thank you for looking at
[01:50] the videos and um reaching out to me and
[01:51] doing this for me but what's inspired me
[01:55] is um I used to do precious metal videos
[01:58] and I kind of through precious metals
[02:01] because I wanted to share my experience
[02:03] with uh the broken money and everything
[02:06] else what I learned in 2020 I started
[02:08] September 2020 I just wanted to tell
[02:10] everybody and show my love of precious
[02:14] metals uh the broken money that we're in
[02:17] and also the lies that we've been told
[02:19] because I used to tell people uh you
[02:22] know in person and stuff like that but I
[02:23] figured if I get on the internet it
[02:24] would be a little bit better to do that
[02:26] more efficient and so I started doing
[02:28] that and then during my research of
[02:31] broken money and everything else and
[02:33] more about precious metals I started
[02:35] learning about cryptocurrency right we
[02:39] always start with cryptocurrency and
[02:41] then um I started to notice that there's
[02:43] a little difference between Bitcoin and
[02:45] crypto in the beginning and then I
[02:46] started
[02:48] know there was a lot bigger difference
[02:50] between Bitcoin crypto and then after
[02:52] two months of having a little bit of
[02:54] crypto I sold it all put it all into
[02:57] Bitcoin and then my video started
[03:00] transitioning Into Gold Silver Platinum
[03:03] to oh do a little bit of crypto in Gold
[03:05] and Silver Platinum then oh maybe you
[03:07] should get some Bitcoin and gold and
[03:09] silver and platinum and then more
[03:11] Bitcoin less precious metals more
[03:14] Bitcoin less precious metals and then I
[03:16] sold everything into uh Bitcoin all my
[03:20] precious
[03:21] metals uh the black hole of Bitcoin got
[03:23] me and I sucked in and uh I just kept
[03:26] making my videos and now it's all
[03:28] Bitcoin and now Satoshi and Bitcoin I
[03:32] love it so much and it this the
[03:33] transition that a lot of people undergo
[03:35] I also was in stocks before and kind of
[03:37] shifted to like 50% stocks 50% Bitcoin
[03:41] and I'm like all in a little bit over
[03:43] all in even um but like when you make
[03:47] videos um you put in a work you put in
[03:50] your energy your time in
[03:52] it what is your main goal with it do you
[03:55] want to educate people uh do you want to
[03:57] make it a a full-time thing or is it
[04:00] already a full-time thing for
[04:01] you when I first started it was just a
[04:04] continuation of what I was doing with
[04:05] precious metals and no it's not a
[04:07] full-time thing it's just a a part-time
[04:09] thing for me um but my my main goal is
[04:14] I'm not a YouTuber to be to be
[04:15] completely honest with you you know I I
[04:17] I saw your video of your whole setup and
[04:19] stuff and that's not me I just have a
[04:21] phone and even us you know how we
[04:23] started off it started off a little
[04:25] rocky with us right as you can see I'm
[04:27] not technically uh you know the most
[04:30] soundest guy in the world so I just I
[04:32] just pick up a phone Robin honestly and
[04:34] I just hold it up and I talk to people
[04:36] and then I upload it to my either
[04:38] through my um editor on my MacBook
[04:41] sometimes especially for Satoshi
[04:43] Saturday I put little funny edits in or
[04:45] if I'm busy throughout my throughout my
[04:47] day I just record and then upload so I'm
[04:51] not reaching a lot of people right now
[04:53] but the main reason I do it is so I can
[04:56] reach some more people uh friends family
[04:58] uh somebody just happens if YouTube
[05:00] happens to uh you
[05:03] know reach out and put my video out
[05:06] there uh because you know we're we're a
[05:08] niche we're a niche little thing Bitcoin
[05:11] point I think it's like 0 five% of the
[05:13] population I believe that's what I've
[05:14] heard what what have you heard by the
[05:16] way yeah I mean it's it's it's it's
[05:18] really depends on what metrics you're
[05:20] you're looking at because if you look at
[05:22] like how many people own Bitcoin in some
[05:25] sort of like you can make an argument
[05:28] everyone that holds the S&P 5
[05:30] owns a little bit of Bitcoin because
[05:32] Tesla holds a little bit of Bitcoin so
[05:34] if you count that a lot of people have
[05:35] Bitcoin but if you actually count who
[05:38] actually understands Bitcoin and holds
[05:41] them and holds a significant amount in
[05:43] Bitcoin like over 20% of their total net
[05:47] worth then the number gets really small
[05:50] like we're really early on like even if
[05:53] a lot of people have like a a little bit
[05:54] of Bitcoin and there are different
[05:57] numbers in in Swiss it's like eight % in
[06:00] America it's maybe a little bit more
[06:02] then Nigeria we at like 10 20% Then
[06:04] other parts of the world we're more
[06:06] closer to 1% so it's it depends really
[06:09] on on what metrics you're using and on
[06:11] on what kind of thing you're looking at
[06:13] but in the end I mean there are like uh
[06:18] 200 million addresses uh or 150 million
[06:21] addresses above a certain threshold of
[06:24] of Bitcoins but then one person can have
[06:27] multiple addresses
[06:29] one address that could be like a
[06:31] coinbase where like millions of people
[06:33] are on one address so there are a lot of
[06:35] debates on that uh and it's it's really
[06:38] hard to pick an
[06:40] adoption what metrics is the the
[06:42] adoption thing I just like to look at uh
[06:47] Google Trends also and and more social
[06:50] things like what what are the biggest
[06:52] Bitcoin influences how many followers do
[06:54] they have what are the current views on
[06:56] that uh and I mean but maybe that's just
[06:59] because I'm coming from that area and
[07:01] I'm doing a lot of videos videos and
[07:02] researching that department it would be
[07:05] interesting for example to know how many
[07:07] Hardware wallets has been sold that
[07:09] would be an interesting uh statistics
[07:11] that I would like to know but we don't
[07:12] know because there Hardware companies
[07:14] don't give them out uh so yeah we can we
[07:17] can just guess yeah and it's hard too
[07:20] because people have multiple you know
[07:23] wallets and stuff like that but back to
[07:25] your question your original question the
[07:26] reason I do it is because um part two
[07:29] Parts I I like to document my life
[07:32] because I I really feel like Robin that
[07:34] um when we look back at these times you
[07:36] know the people back in the early days
[07:38] the early days of 2010 11 12 or whatever
[07:41] you know they got it at the crazy low
[07:43] prices but I believe that the gap
[07:45] between them and us is going to be
[07:47] minuscule uh compared to between the gap
[07:50] between us and people from 15 20 years
[07:53] from now I I believe that so I want to
[07:55] be able to show wouldn't it be cool to
[07:57] watch a video of your great-grandfather
[07:59] or something you know back in the days
[08:02] talking and being in real life because I
[08:03] believe
[08:04] that we're on a timeline that
[08:08] uh it's just unbelievable the prices
[08:10] that we're going to be getting and being
[08:11] an early adopter and um when Bitcoin is
[08:15] in the you know it's it's of course we
[08:17] measure it by dollars and stuff I don't
[08:19] like to do it but we have to do it
[08:20] because that's the measurement
[08:21] stick but it's going to be in the
[08:24] millions I mean it's it's going to be in
[08:26] the millions before obviously before it
[08:28] gets to Global adoption and Satoshi are
[08:31] the you know the standard of uh
[08:33] transacting with um it's going to be
[08:36] cool to that's why in every Satoshi
[08:38] Saturday video I do we'll get to that I
[08:40] guess in a minute I always talk about
[08:42] what the price is today the block height
[08:45] and how many Satoshi you can get for $1
[08:47] and I want my great grandkids to look
[08:49] back and say you got ,400 Satoshi for $1
[08:53] I mean people are not going to be able
[08:54] to get that in in a month or two months
[08:57] or whatever it is so I do it for that
[08:59] for documentation for my family and just
[09:01] for myself and all that stuff and I also
[09:03] do it uh for the little small little
[09:05] reach that I can do and just try to do
[09:07] my part to help uh on the internet to
[09:09] orange pill as many people as I can yeah
[09:13] the grandkids will ask what is a
[09:16] dollar why did you accept the government
[09:18] money like why why why is why is that a
[09:21] thing but maybe not I don't know how how
[09:24] fast are we with the adoption it really
[09:25] interesting yeah um maybe uh with with
[09:30] with that what you're doing in with the
[09:32] block height that's like a Time chain
[09:34] thing I love that topic when we get into
[09:36] the spit time trade thing uh and and
[09:39] also the price that you're mentioning
[09:41] that because it is important because
[09:42] most people still to this St measure
[09:46] everything in Euros in dollars in the
[09:48] Fiat currencies so I think we as
[09:51] bitcoiners as we also want to get away
[09:53] from this Fiat world but we have to
[09:55] adopt to the masses and uh tell them
[09:58] also okay
[10:00] this is the potential for Bitcoin and
[10:02] put it in a context so they understand
[10:03] it I don't like to talk about dollars
[10:06] and and Euros uh because I know the
[10:09] system is is riged and is is bad for us
[10:12] um but it's a reality of of most people
[10:15] and if we don't get to them where they
[10:17] are then we lose them anyway so and and
[10:21] it's still the best marketing tool I
[10:23] feel like of course there other Freedom
[10:25] marketing tools for example with
[10:26] Canadian trackers is always a great
[10:28] example where a lot of people came in
[10:31] because oh government can just freeze my
[10:34] money is the money that cannot be frozen
[10:37] yes there is Bitcoin that's a marketing
[10:39] tool but the biggest marketing tool is
[10:41] when the Bitcoin price all of the sudden
[10:43] in the I don't know in July shoots up to
[10:45] 150,000 then everybody's talking about
[10:48] it and a lot of more people will come
[10:50] into the scene uh that's still the best
[10:52] marketing tool and will be interesting
[10:54] how it shakes out but let's let's get to
[10:58] the like the underlying thing of of that
[11:01] all and you have coming from precious
[11:04] metal and now you're in Bitcoin and the
[11:07] one thing that people like gold people
[11:09] like P Shi and and also bitcoiners like
[11:12] we are having in common we kind of agree
[11:15] on the problem like we kind of agree
[11:17] like what's wrong with with with our
[11:20] monetary system so you probably got
[11:24] what's wrong with our system before
[11:25] Bitcoin because we were in precious
[11:27] metal uh what did you what's what's your
[11:29] a main thing what uh you thought is
[11:32] unfair or not good with our
[11:34] system good question well first of all
[11:37] before I answer that I want to say this
[11:38] too I forgot one part another reason I
[11:41] make the videos because I had a little
[11:42] bit of a following for precious metal
[11:44] stackers and I kind of want to be a
[11:47] uh a kind of a bridge between Bitcoin
[11:51] and uh cryptocurrency nonsense with them
[11:55] because a lot of my uh precious metal
[11:58] stackers that I that I even the guys I
[12:00] look up to still you know and the people
[12:02] a lot of them that follow me um you know
[12:05] they're they're very skeptical about
[12:07] Bitcoin because they think it's a
[12:08] cryptocurrency and I have actually
[12:10] transitioned uh quite a few people from
[12:13] precious metals not like all the way
[12:15] like to me like what you know with us
[12:17] with Bitcoin Maxis I have done a few of
[12:19] them but that's another reason why I'm
[12:21] making these videos so that I can um get
[12:24] precious metal stackers to understand
[12:25] that hey I I had a bunch of this
[12:27] precious metals and and again it's it's
[12:29] great it's way better than fiat currency
[12:31] precious metals it's hard money um but
[12:33] it's not finite scarce money finality of
[12:36] uh you know scarcity like like Bitcoin
[12:38] so I try to get them over that's another
[12:40] thing but as far as what was the
[12:42] question again
[12:43] sorry uh says made the comparison like
[12:46] oh you were in in precious metal you
[12:48] were in Bitcoin and what's the
[12:49] underlying thing is the monetary system
[12:52] is broken uh so I was like Curious what
[12:55] was your first touch point with like
[12:58] like I think like
[12:59] people when you get into Bitcoin or
[13:01] breast metal they're like unsatisfied
[13:03] with some part of the system uh and what
[13:06] is the main thing that was disturbing
[13:09] you with the financial system and then
[13:10] you probably got into rabbit hole and
[13:12] then you got into like what's the
[13:14] current system and stuff like that but
[13:16] like what was the first thing that you
[13:17] like oh that's that's that that should
[13:20] not be there yeah yeah well I my
[13:23] background is finance I went to school
[13:24] for finance and so I was the guy in my
[13:27] uh in my 30s I was reading about money
[13:30] and I wanted to be rich and this that
[13:32] and the third I remember Robert kosaki
[13:33] said this in a book I think or a seminar
[13:35] or something I loved I used to love
[13:37] Robert Kaki still do he said if you want
[13:40] to be rich you have to study money right
[13:43] just like if you want to be a cook you
[13:44] have to study food if you want to be a
[13:46] lawyer you have to study law so I went
[13:48] to finance school and a lot of that
[13:50] stuff I wanted to be a personal
[13:52] financial advisor to people and on the
[13:55] side I wanted to you know invest in
[13:58] different you know entrepreneurial
[13:59] things and real estate and you know
[14:02] different businesses and stuff like that
[14:03] you remember the ebsi four quadrants of
[14:07] uh you know the cash flow quadrants and
[14:09] everything else I learned all about that
[14:11] but one thing that really bothered me
[14:12] about uh being a personal financial
[14:14] advisor I didn't like the way the system
[14:17] was uh was built because I was reading I
[14:19] was learning about the traditional
[14:20] Finance through
[14:22] school but I was reading entrepreneurial
[14:25] stuff in Robert kosaki and I'm like this
[14:26] stuff is not adding up to what I'm
[14:28] learning in this book from this book
[14:30] right Rich Dad Poor Dad or this that and
[14:32] third and then I had a real life
[14:35] situation happen to me where I had some
[14:37] cash in the bank and I wanted to buy a
[14:40] car right and the person wanted you know
[14:42] we wanted cash you know so I wanted to
[14:44] get the cash out of the bank and the
[14:45] bank wouldn't let me take the money
[14:47] out and they would ask me all these
[14:49] questions I had to fill all this stuff
[14:50] and I'm just like this is my money why
[14:53] do I have to I mean they were literally
[14:56] grilling me like I was
[14:59] a terrorist or something or I was
[15:00] something you know bad and I'm like this
[15:02] is and I and I really thought about I
[15:03] was in there for half an hour talking
[15:06] about my money and getting my money out
[15:08] and that was the first Bell that went
[15:10] off and this happened in 2019 it was
[15:12] kind of later and then in 2020 of course
[15:15] when we all had to stay home and sit
[15:17] down for a couple of months that's when
[15:18] I started getting into precious metals
[15:20] and that's when I really learned what
[15:22] inflation really was I kind of knew what
[15:24] it was and I was right there with it but
[15:26] that just brought me over when I knew
[15:28] that um
[15:29] inflation came from one place and that
[15:31] was Washington DC here in America and
[15:34] for them to print money that we work for
[15:37] and they can just press a button and
[15:39] they can just dilute it and debase it um
[15:42] that right there that's when I knew the
[15:43] money was broken and that uh just
[15:46] brought me down a um a rabbit hole that
[15:48] I just haven't been out of like I just
[15:50] couldn't believe that all these years I
[15:51] was fooled to not only think that hey I
[15:55] was working hard and I I wanted to be
[15:57] rich but the only reason I wanted to be
[15:58] rich rich is because in 1971 August 15th
[16:02] 1971 when Richard Nixon took us off the
[16:04] gold standard and by the way Richard
[16:06] Nixon's not a bad guy he gets a lot of
[16:09] uh you know bad rep for that but he's a
[16:10] really good president but that's not for
[16:12] this video but um when that happened uh
[16:16] it's like wow you know WTF happened in
[16:18] 1971 and all everybody started think
[16:21] going from thinking about oh how life is
[16:23] good and blah blah blah now everybody's
[16:25] thinking about money and how I make more
[16:27] of it and that's when all the rich
[16:29] getting rich stuff came out and I'm just
[16:31] like that's that's why I think that way
[16:33] because they were cooking a slow and a
[16:35] and a in a pot of water like frogs right
[16:39] they were boiling us slowly but then in
[16:41] 2020 they turned to heat up so when I
[16:42] found that out I just been on the
[16:44] mission ever since to uh not only learn
[16:46] more but to wake as many people up as I
[16:49] can uh for the lies from the
[16:52] lies yeah and it's that frog example is
[16:55] really interesting because um it it's
[16:58] it's ly known that the the Frog sample
[17:01] he doesn't get it but what I found and
[17:05] made some some research on on that maybe
[17:07] I'm wrong but what I found is the Frog
[17:10] actually jumps out at one point like
[17:13] when you boil a frog he actually tries
[17:16] to jump out at some point when it gets
[17:17] too hot and I think um people with the
[17:21] monitary system are also not that stupid
[17:24] the pain is just not big enough now the
[17:27] the it sounds weird because we printed
[17:30] so much money but because we are really
[17:32] good in and efficient in producing stuff
[17:34] we're getting really good in computer
[17:37] stuff uh and and we getting really good
[17:39] with AI and that stuff like there's a
[17:40] really big deflationary Force that's
[17:43] driving down prices without that
[17:46] deflationary Force we would have already
[17:48] inflation of like 50 60% probably higher
[17:51] than that um and that's why the pain is
[17:55] not high enough and and the system still
[17:57] is running but I think I think if we
[17:59] keep on printing money at some point the
[18:02] pain will be high enough all the frogs
[18:05] not only us will jump out of the water
[18:07] and and we will we will get it at at
[18:09] some point I hope so I I feel like that
[18:13] I see the the even now like inflation uh
[18:17] is a topic I I see the right now the EU
[18:21] election American election off election
[18:23] all of that stuff is right now this year
[18:26] ongoing uh and I only watch it for one
[18:29] specific reason I want to know what
[18:32] topics they're talking about I really
[18:33] don't care what politicians saying what
[18:36] I don't want to get into this but but
[18:39] I'm interested in what topics are they
[18:40] talking about of course in the European
[18:42] Union Ukraine war is a big thing uh but
[18:45] also inflation and things are getting
[18:48] more expensive is act topic they're not
[18:50] talking about the solution they're not
[18:52] talking about Bitcoin but inflation is a
[18:54] topic and that's that's interesting us
[18:56] to me um but you also talked about
[18:59] like they fooled us uh the lies that
[19:02] they were telling us um is there
[19:04] something that like who do you mean when
[19:07] when you say like they're lying to us
[19:09] they're fooling us is is that like the
[19:11] mainstream media central banks like what
[19:14] are you addressing that all the
[19:17] above they all lied to us I mean every I
[19:21] mean think about this right you know I'm
[19:23] American I don't I don't know how you
[19:24] guys grew up but but you know we relied
[19:26] and and this is a spoiler alert for all
[19:28] the kids
[19:29] um got lied about Santa Claus we got
[19:32] lied about the Tooth Fairy the Easter
[19:35] the Easter Bunny right all all I mean
[19:37] even as a kid all these things you know
[19:40] are lies and then when we grow up in
[19:41] school what do they tell us they tell us
[19:44] uh you got to get good grades right all
[19:47] the way from elementary school to Middle
[19:50] School to high school they say good good
[19:53] grades so you can get into a good
[19:55] college and then when you get in a good
[19:57] college you'll get a good safe secure
[20:00] job right but now that's not that's not
[20:03] what it is that the world is changing
[20:05] you just brought up that thing with the
[20:06] technology I'm I'm I'm reading almost
[20:08] done with Jeff boo book um you know the
[20:12] what I'm talking about uh I got it on my
[20:13] phone the
[20:14] proc yes oh my God that's such a good
[20:17] book and and he's telling us he's like
[20:19] look man uh you know I always talk about
[20:22] being adaptable and stuff like that we
[20:23] have to adapt to the Future because the
[20:25] future is on its way and with these uh
[20:28] is coming out they're just getting
[20:30] exponentially and this book was written
[20:32] in 2019 I believe because he keep saying
[20:34] 2019 in the book and this was even
[20:36] before the pandemic started so this was
[20:38] five years earlier and when he's talking
[20:40] about these things I'm just like wow all
[20:42] the things that we grew up thinking
[20:44] because my grandparents they worked at
[20:46] you know they worked at factories and
[20:47] they worked somewhere for 40 50 years
[20:50] and then they retired and they got their
[20:51] pension another law they told us is that
[20:53] you know uh our pensions are going to be
[20:57] there our social security is going to be
[20:58] there there and a lot of these companies
[20:59] are not going to give you a pension a
[21:01] lot of the governments a lot of people
[21:02] are saying Social Security is going to
[21:04] run out in the 2030s somewhere um in in
[21:06] the United States so it's like what what
[21:09] are you what are you gonna look forward
[21:11] to you can't stay at a job more than 10
[21:13] plus years now right the whole system
[21:16] that we grew up with our parents and our
[21:18] grandparents you know the American dream
[21:20] about buying a house I mean you're a
[21:21] young guy man it's like people your age
[21:25] I mean they can't buy a house right now
[21:28] you know and they R Li to because nobody
[21:30] has any idea what the what the reason
[21:32] the underlying reason is and it's an
[21:35] inflation and nobody tell us is about it
[21:37] so the whole thing to me and the whole
[21:39] system is is just a big lie is it do you
[21:42] think it's um purposely lying or is it
[21:46] just an old system that cannot keep up
[21:48] with uh the the actual world uh I
[21:52] sometimes also think like the central
[21:54] banks um when you see the history there
[21:57] were maybe some people that were
[21:59] malicious with it uh and but there are a
[22:02] lot of people that just working at the
[22:04] central bank and working there and they
[22:06] truly believe that BS that they are
[22:10] telling and and they are really like I
[22:13] know clever people that have no interest
[22:15] in the Central Bank uh and they really
[22:19] believe in inflation is
[22:21] good because they don't know better
[22:23] they're not malicious they they just
[22:25] they just uh ignorant to to the truth
[22:28] and doing deep research um and this is
[22:31] something that I'm like I think the
[22:34] system just grew uh and is is really bad
[22:37] for us but there's no really like a
[22:41] person behind that has all the like puts
[22:45] all the strings and maybe it's like the
[22:46] the one malicious guy or I think the
[22:49] system just grew in a really bad way and
[22:51] we have to get rid of that toxic system
[22:54] now yes I believe it's a combination of
[22:56] both they're lying to us on purpose and
[22:58] it's also the system is old um people
[23:02] are uh blissfully ignorant because
[23:06] there's so many distractions here and I
[23:08] know they're not uh on accident you know
[23:10] I have I know people in their 40s that
[23:13] still play video
[23:14] games nights and weekends after after
[23:17] work again there's nothing wrong with
[23:18] playing video games but you know that
[23:21] watch stupid you know I know people that
[23:22] watch stupid TV shows they'll be on
[23:24] Instagram they'll be on Tik Tok and I
[23:27] believe that they do things in short
[23:29] burst with these social medias that
[23:30] you're always scrolling and they don't
[23:32] want you to watch long form things they
[23:34] want you to always constantly be
[23:36] bombarded with a short attention span
[23:38] things number one and then if you are
[23:40] watching a TV show they'll put little
[23:42] commercials in there that they want you
[23:43] to watch so I think that in itself is is
[23:47] a is part of the lie and also the old
[23:50] system that we were in they're just not
[23:52] going to come out and tell you hey that
[23:54] system is broken it's not good the new
[23:56] system is here because if you start if
[23:58] they start telling you that then they
[24:00] have to start telling you about the lies
[24:01] as well and they don't want to do that
[24:04] so I think the whole thing and my
[24:06] personal opinion is a scam I don't want
[24:07] to get too far down the uh the rabbit
[24:10] hole of my my theories on that but
[24:14] um being being my age I'm in my late 40s
[24:17] seeing the things that I've seen in my
[24:18] life and growing up with uh the silent
[24:21] generation I grew up with my my uh
[24:23] grandparents and growing up with Baby
[24:25] Boomers I'm a uh Generation X myself um
[24:28] I see uh the changes that are happening
[24:31] in this country or in the world excuse
[24:33] me and it's just uh it's not good man
[24:37] it's not good and there's so many lies
[24:38] in in the old system again
[24:41] um and these people need to wake up you
[24:45] know and it's hard I heard a quote from
[24:46] Dick Gregory the other day it says uh he
[24:48] says when the universe gives you goggles
[24:51] to see everything there two rules to
[24:53] this he said first rule is he said the
[24:56] first rule is once you see what you see
[24:59] you cannot unsee it you will always see
[25:01] these things and the second rule is you
[25:04] can't make people see what you
[25:07] see and that's the hard part because us
[25:10] as bitcoiners we're just like how do you
[25:12] not see this how do you not see this so
[25:15] that right there is the hardest part
[25:17] because like you said oh 2% inflation is
[25:20] good right you want to say something
[25:22] look like you want to say something yeah
[25:24] it's it's definitely like that when you
[25:27] have like uh so many people are saying
[25:29] like oh that inflation is good no no
[25:32] Bitcoin that's for criminals no Bitcoin
[25:34] that's for speculate for specul oh no
[25:37] Bitcoin is just for rich people like I
[25:38] heard so many crazy uh story about that
[25:42] and it's it's it's fascinating for me
[25:44] that they they don't get it because you
[25:47] all have that when you get Bitcoin you
[25:49] have that like oh tomorrow everyone
[25:52] gets it and I have to really buy
[25:53] everything now because soon everyone
[25:56] gets it and then the price shoots up to
[25:57] 50 million no that it takes time like
[26:00] it's like there's a process um even
[26:03] though we have not interet and
[26:04] information is getting distributed
[26:07] really fast now but the information has
[26:10] to come to brain that's still the same
[26:12] as 50 years ago 100 years ago the human
[26:15] brain did not get an update and an
[26:17] information thing maybe even like a
[26:19] downgrade uh we could we could AR argue
[26:22] because so many AI tools and so many uh
[26:24] internet things take so much of our um
[26:28] Havey lifting already down so like I I
[26:32] use AI I think probably like 20 30 times
[26:36] on a day because I do so much stuff with
[26:39] AI it's it's it's fascinating for me one
[26:41] year ago I did not use any AI purposely
[26:45] like I'm talking about interfaces like
[26:46] cgbd or other softwares that I directly
[26:49] use of course one year ago probably used
[26:52] AI with when I used YouTube because
[26:54] there's an algorithm behind that who
[26:56] serves content not talking about this
[26:58] but now I'm I'm using it so much so the
[27:02] point here is um people need to
[27:06] understand Bitcoin and it takes time and
[27:08] that's why I take the long approach I
[27:10] will do this podcast till I die because
[27:13] I think till I die I have to educate
[27:16] people on something I will I will not
[27:18] like in my lifespan I'm now 25 if I live
[27:21] 100 years old I will do this the next 75
[27:24] years you're a young man
[27:26] man and I I commend you for that
[27:29] seriously uh to do it every every day
[27:31] for the rest of your life CU you do it
[27:32] seven days a week we talked about that I
[27:34] make videos seven days a week too but
[27:36] you're right it does take time I I this
[27:38] is what I talk about on my channel I
[27:39] don't tell anybody to buy Bitcoin or buy
[27:42] Bitcoin or Satoshi it's all about your
[27:45] education right I don't want anybody
[27:47] just to buy it because like you said
[27:49] most people are going to buy it because
[27:51] the the price is going up you know the
[27:52] Fiat dollar so they want to make money
[27:54] and want to get rich that's anytime I
[27:56] talk to people about Bitcoin is a
[27:58] that's the first thing they say well I
[28:00] can't afford it how much is it how much
[28:03] money did you make I I did I went to the
[28:05] eye doctor yesterday I made a video
[28:07] outside the eye doctor too and when they
[28:09] were checking me out she I had to ask me
[28:11] about Bitcoin shirt on right I wear that
[28:13] stuff all the time and she goes this the
[28:16] first thing she says she says did you
[28:17] sell this time I said when she said that
[28:21] I'm just like sell this time what did
[28:22] she she's talking about when it went up
[28:24] to 70 something did I sell this time
[28:26] like the last time it went to 60 9 and
[28:28] I'm like no I did not sell this time I
[28:31] said did you because I want to see where
[28:33] her head is at she's like no no I got
[28:35] some from me and my kids and of course
[28:37] us as bitcoiners we're GNA say do you
[28:38] have it on the cold storage do you got
[28:40] it you know because because we know that
[28:43] they have it on an exchange obviously
[28:45] they don't own it when they do that but
[28:47] they talk about the Fiat price right and
[28:50] she says yeah I got something for me and
[28:51] my kids and everything and I tell people
[28:52] I go look you know on my channel and in
[28:55] person when I sit down with them I say
[28:56] look don't wor about the price just buy
[28:59] some here and there but the most
[29:01] important thing is before you buy you
[29:02] have to educate yourself you know and I
[29:05] tell them a list of things to learn
[29:07] about you know what is a Satoshi uh what
[29:09] is the difficulty adjustment or what is
[29:12] the block height or just just a couple
[29:14] things like that because once they have
[29:15] a little bit because I always zap them a
[29:17] little bit of some Satoshi maybe a
[29:18] thousand Satoshi 100 500 whatever and
[29:22] then once they got some skin in the game
[29:24] you know and I said listen don't worry
[29:25] about the Fiat price just learn about
[29:27] that I always tell them look at a
[29:29] Satoshi like a dollar that's what I tell
[29:32] people they go what what are you talking
[29:33] about and I talk about that on my um my
[29:35] Satoshi Saturday series you know look at
[29:38] Satoshi like dollars and again we'll
[29:40] probably get into that in a minute but
[29:42] um the main thing is you have to
[29:44] study but they and again it's hard to do
[29:47] that because what like we said before
[29:49] they want to keep you going like this
[29:50] scrolling on your phone they want you
[29:52] playing video games they want you being
[29:54] on all these different social media
[29:56] things and they don't want you to sit
[29:57] down and watch a 30 minute video and
[29:59] actually learn something they only want
[30:00] to teach you specific things about the
[30:02] Fiat school that they want you in or the
[30:05] college or whatever or whatever course
[30:07] but I said listen never work harder at a
[30:10] job or at school than you do on yourself
[30:13] that's what I think Jim Ron says I I add
[30:15] the school part but if you're going to
[30:17] work that hard and take all these notes
[30:18] for your boss and take all these notes
[30:20] at
[30:21] school take a Bitcoin class go to
[30:24] bitcoin University Matthew CR he's a
[30:26] great teacher right go there you know
[30:29] listen to Robin's uh interviews listen
[30:31] to these guys Grant cordor Len to these
[30:33] people and take notes just like you do
[30:35] with school just like you do at work and
[30:38] again work harder on yourself than you
[30:40] do any other job so my main thing is is
[30:42] not buying Bitcoin but studying Bitcoin
[30:45] if you are listening to this podcast you
[30:47] might be wondering what is actually the
[30:49] setup look like of Robin or how can I
[30:51] improve my Bitcoin setup and there's two
[30:54] things you have to buy Bitcoin from the
[30:55] right source and you have to store
[30:57] Bitcoin coin the right way let's focus
[30:59] on the first thing how to buy Bitcoin
[31:02] it's simple have a Bitcoin only exchange
[31:04] don't deal with the shitcoin exchanges
[31:06] don't deal with an exchange that has an
[31:08] own token or something like that be on a
[31:11] Bitcoin only exchange I use 21 Bitcoin
[31:13] 21 Bitcoin is for me the best partner
[31:16] for that and now where do you store
[31:19] Bitcoin Bitcoin should be stored on a
[31:21] hardware wallet on a self custody
[31:24] solution where you yourself hold your
[31:27] keys and it should be a cold wallet so
[31:30] that's my Simple Solutions that's a
[31:32] bitbox you just put your Bitcoin on
[31:35] there back up your seat phas and you are
[31:38] better than 95% of all Bitcoin hodlers
[31:41] if you have more than ,000 in Bitcoin
[31:44] it's an absolutely must have one last
[31:47] thing before we get back to the video
[31:49] I'm really passionate about meeting
[31:50] other bitcoiners and there's an amazing
[31:53] opportunity in middle of Europe in June
[31:56] the Bitcoin Brock conference it's the
[31:59] best and biggest Bitcoin only conference
[32:02] in whole of Europe for all Americans
[32:04] please visit Europe and visit this place
[32:07] in June for all europees it's a must go
[32:10] anyways you're so close to the Bitcoin
[32:12] PR conference you basically have to come
[32:14] I will do interviews there and I would
[32:16] love to meet you all there use code
[32:19] Robin for all my sponsors to get
[32:22] discounts and use the links down in the
[32:24] description amazing and you mentioned it
[32:26] Sates and what you want to talk about um
[32:30] still people right now think in Bitcoin
[32:32] terms and they're like oh how much is
[32:33] one Bitcoin but how how important is it
[32:37] that we start to think in satous how
[32:39] like what what what's the like what what
[32:42] is also the the motivation behind
[32:44] yourself to make a satosi journ not a
[32:47] not a Bitcoin
[32:48] thing great question it's so important
[32:52] right because the first thing when we
[32:54] look on TV right you look on TV and you
[32:56] look on Fox News Fox Business what do
[32:58] they see say see Robin you see Bitcoin
[33:01] 69,000 Bitcoin 71,000 Bitcoin 63,000 so
[33:05] what is a normal person gonna say I
[33:07] can't afford that who the right who can
[33:10] afford that
[33:13] so people don't know about satoshi's
[33:16] because they never talk about it in the
[33:17] mainstream I think I want to say it's on
[33:19] purpose I'm not I'm not going to go that
[33:21] far um you know but people can't afford
[33:23] it every time I talk to somebody about
[33:26] hey you know when they ask me about my
[33:27] shirt or have you ever heard of Bitcoin
[33:29] the first thing he say is oh yeah I
[33:30] can't afford that I missed a
[33:31] boat I heard about it when it was 10,000
[33:34] or 5,000 or 3,000 but it's too much now
[33:37] so my motivation in making Satoshi
[33:39] Saturdays because I make one every
[33:41] Saturday is I know that in the future no
[33:44] one's going to be talking about Bitcoin
[33:47] I think Satoshi is going to be the new
[33:49] Bitcoin because there's a 100 million
[33:51] Satoshi in every Bitcoin so how I
[33:53] describe it to people I say look you
[33:55] don't really have a dollar right you
[33:57] either got a 100 pennies four quarters
[34:01] 10 dimes 20 nickels it's all fractions I
[34:04] go right I say yeah okay I go that's
[34:06] what a Bitcoin is there is no such thing
[34:08] as a Bitcoin and literally there's
[34:10] there's no such thing as a Bitcoin we
[34:12] call it Bitcoin but it's a bunch of
[34:15] Satoshi so now the number is Big a 100
[34:18] million Satoshi that's like oh that's
[34:20] too big I know it sounds big but we're
[34:22] talking about eight billion people right
[34:25] so when we talk about the 2.1
[34:26] quadrillion Satoshi because that's all
[34:29] that will ever be and you and I know
[34:31] that there's not going to be that many
[34:33] right because some are lost and some
[34:34] people will never move them and
[34:36] satoshi's got you know 1.1 million or
[34:39] something like that
[34:42] Bitcoin so when I talked to people I go
[34:44] look buy a dollar $1 today will get you
[34:48] this many Satoshi 1400 and something
[34:50] Satoshi today and so I started that
[34:52] series Fe February 10th 2024 and the
[34:56] motivation behind that is honestly is
[34:59] for the documentation purposes that I
[35:01] talked about earlier but I believe that
[35:04] in maybe 10 years or less or a little
[35:07] bit longer I you know I'm not sure I
[35:09] don't have a crystal ball but I believe
[35:11] that uh we're going to be moving away
[35:13] from Bitcoin because once Bitcoin uh
[35:15] gets to uh you know in Fiat terms gets
[35:19] into millions and stuff like that once
[35:20] it hits a millionar I believe first of
[35:22] all I think that's just a layer that
[35:24] nobody can ignore it now nobody can and
[35:27] I just want to have have kind of like um
[35:30] like when the train when the Bitcoin
[35:32] train is coming and like me and you are
[35:34] doing every day we're laying down the
[35:36] tracks and even though it may may some
[35:39] somebody may not look look at our videos
[35:40] for maybe five six years I want to lay
[35:43] it down and say wow these
[35:44] Satoshi are the way to go so if they say
[35:47] what about Bitcoin what is bitcoin and
[35:50] the Satoshi start coming up and they
[35:51] start hearing Satoshi okay Satoshi what
[35:53] are that the Satoshi Saturday will come
[35:55] up and they'll say oh what's this
[35:58] oh 100 let me write that down 100
[36:00] million Satoshi in one Bitcoin oh I can
[36:02] spend $1 on bitcoin because everybody
[36:04] has a unit bias that's the reason why I
[36:06] used to buy cryptocur cryptocurrencies
[36:09] in the beginning I'm like oh man Bitcoin
[36:11] oh man I this Litecoin or this scoin or
[36:14] whatever I can get buy it for 50 cents
[36:17] and I and I had a specific video about
[36:19] that I said unit bu does not exist with
[36:21] Bitcoin because again you can buy $1 you
[36:24] can buy $10 you can buy
[36:26] $20 and get satosi Satoshi are the are
[36:30] the ones yeah yeah this is the thing
[36:34] that I always tell people when they
[36:36] because I get this question asked a lot
[36:39] when I come to my uh Normy friends uh
[36:43] and they talk like oh what's what's the
[36:44] next Bitcoin I'm like
[36:47] Satoshi that that's that's the next
[36:49] Bitcoin uh and they're like oh what is
[36:52] Satoshi what like what is the protocol
[36:54] like and then I'm telling them I'm like
[36:56] they're like oh there sounds like
[36:57] Bitcoin yeah bit like 100 million satosi
[37:01] is one Bitcoin and they're like what
[37:02] you're fooling us no I'm not fooling but
[37:06] it's it is interesting with the point
[37:08] you raised when
[37:11] um will like why are not people talking
[37:14] about Sosi they only talking about
[37:16] Bitcoin I think just because people are
[37:18] not ready for it I
[37:20] think if if CNN or like C like CNBC is
[37:26] is the big thing America I think we we
[37:28] talking a lot about Bitcoin also uh when
[37:31] they all of the sudden talking only
[37:32] about satosi and not Bitcoin they
[37:34] probably would get calls from from
[37:36] listeners and they're like oh why are
[37:38] you not covering Bitcoin I don't know H
[37:41] but so that the Bitcoin is right not a
[37:42] big thing uh I'm curious to know like
[37:45] what price do you think has Bitcoin to
[37:49] reach that we actually shift to Satoshi
[37:52] because right now I
[37:54] think as Satoshi is just not valuable
[37:57] enough on a euro dollar basis so people
[38:01] are like tending more towards the
[38:02] Bitcoin thing and and giving all the
[38:05] Bitcoin things out even uh Bitcoin
[38:07] influencers still when the price shoots
[38:10] up nobody talks about the toi price like
[38:12] nobody few always do but most of them uh
[38:16] post the Bitcoin price charts and the
[38:19] euros and the dollar bitcoin price
[38:21] charts not the Satoshi one uh I see it
[38:24] more and more that people actually do
[38:26] the satosi comparison
[38:28] uh but is do do you think there's a
[38:30] price like 100,000 or a million or 10
[38:32] Millions where people just ignore
[38:35] Bitcoin and just naturally tend towards
[38:38] uh uh sator because it's just more
[38:41] natural to do it yes that's a good
[38:43] question I think about that a lot but to
[38:45] go back to what you said about why why
[38:47] don't they talk about Satoshi on the
[38:49] news I think it's because like you said
[38:50] it's marketing right Bitcoin is the name
[38:53] that's why I tell people when you're
[38:54] talking about these cryptocurrencies we
[38:56] have the n Network effect right Network
[38:59] effect is so important and bitcoin's
[39:01] network effect I don't care if they came
[39:02] out with something even better than
[39:04] Bitcoin which we know is is impossible
[39:06] but let's just say an alien came down it
[39:08] can't catch up because of the network pH
[39:09] so you got to use the word Bitcoin
[39:11] because of the marketing but also that
[39:13] is a good question when do I think we
[39:15] will start talking about Satoshi I think
[39:17] like I said earlier and you just said I
[39:19] think it's a million dollars to be I
[39:22] think that's the global number because
[39:23] you know it's it's got so much you know
[39:26] meaning in ump to it you know being a
[39:28] millionaire How To Be A Millionaire is
[39:30] this guy a millionaire oh this person
[39:31] you know so I think a million dollars uh
[39:34] will Peak the global interest because
[39:37] you know obviously United States of
[39:39] America has the the United States dollar
[39:41] is the global Reserve currency obviously
[39:43] I'm talking about the United States
[39:45] dollar price because everybody goes by
[39:46] that when you when you look at the price
[39:48] real quick I'm ask you a question when
[39:49] you look at the price do you look at
[39:51] what's it in in Euros first or do you
[39:53] look at the US dollar price first uh I
[39:57] mean right now I'm I think like half a
[40:00] year something like I I don't I really
[40:02] don't look at the price I only get to
[40:04] know about it when it comes up in my
[40:06] Twitter feed uh and then I see like the
[40:10] the the EUR the dollar ones I don't see
[40:12] a lot of Euro charts uh and if someone
[40:15] ask me I always Google the the US dollar
[40:17] to bitcoin um because for me the US
[40:21] dollar is like uh the the mother of all
[40:25] uh F coins uh and and that's the
[40:29] the one to look at like that's the
[40:31] that's the end boss that's because what
[40:33] we're seeing now is like a lot of small
[40:35] fear currencies get dissolved and will
[40:39] dissolve into the US Dollars especially
[40:41] also with stable coins like this
[40:43] transition will go really quickly we see
[40:45] it Argentina has it on the plan El
[40:48] Salvador already did it they have US
[40:50] dollar standard with legal tender in in
[40:54] in in Bitcoin uh and Brazil had with
[40:57] with a Brazilian guy who also writes a
[41:00] coin
[41:00] Telegraph podcast he said also Brazilian
[41:04] has almost all of the reserves in US
[41:07] Dollars and US pressures and US bonds
[41:09] and stuff like that so uh it's it's
[41:11] interesting
[41:12] that weak countries will first go in the
[41:15] US dollar uh and even those who are
[41:18] aware like in Salvador they only have
[41:20] like four% of their reserves in Bitcoin
[41:23] and it it it feels like a lot they're
[41:25] like oh buying bit one Bitcoin day but
[41:27] that's not that's nothing for Salvador
[41:30] like that's not a lot they I made this
[41:33] post because I was like they are bearish
[41:35] like Salvador is not bullish on bitcoin
[41:37] they they they they are not bullish
[41:38] enough they they they should buy so many
[41:40] more Bitcoins if they really may want to
[41:43] advance uh into the future and want to
[41:45] make a bold move till now it's more
[41:47] marketing than a bold move in my
[41:51] eyes yeah is it still do they do one
[41:53] Bitcoin a day still yeah they're still
[41:55] doing it they have a public website
[41:56] where you you can actually track it it
[41:59] looks really good like when you because
[42:00] they're actually doing one Bitcoin a day
[42:02] it's like since a year this this this
[42:04] this up thing I I love it but it's
[42:07] honestly more marketing uh it's it's
[42:10] like I announcing oh I buy 10 Sates
[42:12] every day like
[42:14] wow it's it's great
[42:17] but but buto can do so much so so much
[42:21] better and it's it's it's interesting
[42:23] when people like oh it's Al Bitcoin yeah
[42:25] but why are they not buying buying more
[42:27] Bitcoin yeah I agree I agree and you
[42:29] know even though they're a small country
[42:31] because you know in comparison to our
[42:32] country they're small they could do
[42:34] better but back to the Satoshi thing in
[42:37] the million dollar Satoshi I mean I mean
[42:38] think about it like this Robin right
[42:40] today we can get 1,400 satoshi's 1,400
[42:43] Plus satoshis for $1 right I know we
[42:45] don't like talking about the uh the Fiat
[42:49] but if it goes up to
[42:51] $250,000 US dollar we get 400 Satoshi
[42:54] for a dollar if it goes to half a
[42:56] million we get 200 Satoshi for a dollar
[43:00] if it goes to a one million our number
[43:02] right when we really start talking about
[43:04] satoshis you get a hundred Satoshi for a
[43:07] dollar that's still a steal you know
[43:10] what I mean and and I and I tell people
[43:11] that they're like what are you talking
[43:12] about back in the bar market and I made
[43:14] a video about this yesterday back in the
[43:16] bar Market 2022 2023 I remember I had a
[43:20] goal I was trying to get at least
[43:22] 100,000 uh Satoshi every day at least
[43:25] right and it was so cheap back back then
[43:27] it was you know 20 something bucks
[43:30] sometimes 30 something because we were
[43:32] you know we were ranging from the low
[43:33] 20s to the high you know to the low 30s
[43:36] and somewhere in between and we got
[43:38] stuck in that range and we got a little
[43:40] bit uh complacent we got a little bit
[43:42] you know it was just you know the bare
[43:44] Market was just so long but we didn't
[43:46] realize you know I was getting 3,000
[43:49] 4,000 Satoshi for a dollar I mean if it
[43:52] crashed down today to that price I would
[43:55] be selling everything I could to to to
[43:57] buy that right why not do that now
[44:00] because it's all that those how how many
[44:03] satoshis you can get for $1 it's all
[44:05] relative and I said this in yesterday's
[44:07] video or whenever you do this my last
[44:09] Satoshi Saturday
[44:11] video price is relevant and and and the
[44:15] satoshis and the bare Market is relevant
[44:17] I believe being in the uh low 60s mid
[44:21] 60s high 60s low 70s is going to be uh
[44:24] pennies and pennies and pennies on the
[44:26] dollars of what it's going to be in the
[44:28] future so this is the bare Market but
[44:30] we're getting kind of low to sleep right
[44:32] now because we've been doing this for
[44:33] three plus months and it's has been in
[44:35] this little
[44:36] range but when we're in the six figures
[44:39] seven figures million dollar right we're
[44:41] going to be looking back at this and
[44:43] people GNA say I can't believe you got
[44:44] it for you know ,400 Satoshi for $1 I
[44:47] can't believe you bought under $100,000
[44:49] Bitcoin and all this other stuff so
[44:51] again it's all about uh relativity and I
[44:53] tell people just think about when
[44:55] Bitcoin is going to do what it's going
[44:56] to do and look at today like it's the
[44:58] bare
[44:59] Market there is just nobody that ever
[45:02] said oh I wish I would have bought less
[45:05] Bitcoin like I never heard that
[45:09] sentence and this is kind of like where
[45:11] I always go like um if you can afford
[45:14] more uh buy more and it's it's like when
[45:18] we're talking about someone that already
[45:20] understands and believes in Bitcoin he
[45:22] probably understands himself that he
[45:23] should get more involved and he's
[45:25] working more towards that higher
[45:27] allocation but for new people uh they
[45:31] should really get the education going I
[45:33] always say like first buy some then get
[45:36] educated and then figure out where your
[45:39] allocation is because your allocation is
[45:41] kind of Al of a a trust signal and of
[45:44] course you have to consider like
[45:45] somebody has maybe his own company uh he
[45:48] cannot sell his own company just because
[45:50] he wants to have more Bitcoin uh maybe
[45:53] he has his own house then it's a good
[45:57] argument to just keep the house and and
[45:58] have like there's maybe emotional stuff
[46:00] involved I still have a gold coin
[46:03] actually uh that was gifted to me from
[46:06] my father and has a symbolic emotional
[46:08] value for me uh I would love to
[46:11] liquidate it for Bitcoin honestly but I
[46:14] would never do that because it has
[46:15] emotional value for me uh so it's it's
[46:18] it's sometimes fair to have something
[46:20] else in Bitcoin but in 99% of the cases
[46:24] you should sell it for Bitcoin
[46:27] uh which which I never recommend because
[46:30] it's it's it's your money and you should
[46:32] do whatever you want with your money but
[46:34] uh I basically did that and I'm now I
[46:38] was 120% in Bitcoin now I'm 104% in
[46:41] Bitcoin because I'm I want to get off
[46:44] all the depths that I had uh and I'm I'm
[46:47] working towards like 95% allocation
[46:50] that's like my my my Golden Era where I
[46:52] want to get to it that's a good
[46:55] allocation anything in High 990s 100 or
[46:58] over 100 that's the best ucation I say
[47:00] this in my video I have two little
[47:01] sayings I say uh for Satoshi I say at
[47:04] the end of the video I say stack Satoshi
[47:07] today so you don't have to work for
[47:09] those same Satoshi tomorrow right
[47:11] because one day you'll have to work for
[47:13] those right but during the week during
[47:16] my my regular videos I always talk about
[47:20] uh Bitcoin being the best way to save
[47:22] and to me the only way to save and
[47:24] that's Bitcoin it is the only way to
[47:27] save right so when I had my precious
[47:29] metals and I had a big allocation of my
[47:32] my uh net worth in Precious Metals it
[47:34] was very encumbersome you know because
[47:36] it's stuck in one place it's like a
[47:39] Honeypot of all these physical Metals in
[47:42] one spot so when I went on vacation or
[47:44] left the house even though I have a lot
[47:46] of good security here I just didn't have
[47:48] that peace of mind right and then when I
[47:50] really started getting down to the
[47:52] Bitcoin rabbit hole because what do we
[47:53] do robin we buy Bitcoin and we put it on
[47:56] a hot wallet
[47:57] that's the first thing we do then the
[47:59] next step is oh let's get a cold storage
[48:01] I bought a ledger right had a ledger
[48:04] then I had a treasure Treasure's a
[48:05] little better than than all these things
[48:07] oh Ledger's not Bitcoin only Treasure's
[48:09] not Bitcoin only Ledger has you know
[48:11] this and that don't use that all that
[48:13] stuff that happened so then I got a cold
[48:15] card right then you got you know you got
[48:17] just Bitcoin of C oh I'm good like wait
[48:19] a minute it's only one place got to do
[48:21] some multisig right then you got to you
[48:23] keep moving up and up and up and when
[48:26] you're saving your money it's like I
[48:29] love Bitcoin because when I when I when
[48:31] I go travel somewhere if something
[48:33] happened right and I had to leave I
[48:35] could liquidate all my furniture and
[48:38] everything and put it all into Satoshi
[48:41] or
[48:42] Bitcoin put the words in my head and I
[48:45] can travel anywhere I want to and and I
[48:49] tell people this all the time Bitcoin is
[48:50] satoshis are everywhere and nowhere at
[48:52] the same time so what better SA ings can
[48:57] you have in that so when I tell people
[49:00] you know of course I I do I do have cash
[49:02] for the very very short term you know
[49:05] very like if something happens I'm not
[49:06] selling my satoshis I'm just not so I
[49:08] like to have a little tiny bit of cash I
[49:10] do have credit cards I don't like to use
[49:12] them if I don't have to but I will if
[49:14] it's if it's the amount that's over my
[49:16] cash I do like to have a tiny tiny
[49:18] allocation to that but other than that I
[49:21] mean like the great Michael sailor says
[49:23] there is no second best and there were
[49:26] that never will be probably um that's
[49:28] really cool and one topic I also want to
[49:31] get into with you because you said you
[49:33] you've done that uh already with
[49:35] precious metal stackers and converted
[49:37] them to to to bitcoin and and
[49:41] stackers how do you do that like how
[49:43] what's the the most common things that
[49:45] you have to go over with them what are
[49:48] they not understanding about about
[49:50] Bitcoin is it that digital aspect they
[49:53] they don't trust anything that's digital
[49:55] they think it's from the CIA
[49:57] some do yeah or the NSA yeah uh precious
[50:01] metal stackers are are very uh no
[50:03] offense guys okay I know some of you
[50:04] guys are going to listen to this they're
[50:06] very stubborn and they come from the old
[50:09] school they're usually older guys older
[50:11] gentlemen uh you know some of them are
[50:12] younger in their 30s and stuff like that
[50:14] because they learned from their fathers
[50:15] and their grandfathers and some of them
[50:16] got it passed down and not only did they
[50:18] get the medals passed down but they got
[50:20] the old ideals passed down too to them
[50:23] right because if you don't the the the
[50:26] uh the same in in gold and silver and
[50:28] precious metals is if you don't hold it
[50:30] you don't own it just like we have not
[50:32] your keys not your Bitcoins or not your
[50:34] keys not your cheese right so the
[50:37] biggest hurdle for them it's this is
[50:39] just fairy dust money magical fairy dust
[50:41] money it's not
[50:42] anything you want to say something oh no
[50:45] no no no soor okay okay and and it's
[50:49] like you know it's nothing it's it's
[50:51] it's it's made out of nothing there's no
[50:53] intrinsic value because you brought up
[50:55] uh Peter schift Peter shift to me uh I
[50:58] love Peter Schiff 99% of everything he
[51:00] says right but obviously we know he's
[51:03] wrong about Bitcoin and to this point
[51:05] and I made so many videos on this guy to
[51:07] this point I'm like either this guy is
[51:09] the best marketer in the world and he
[51:12] just wants to be the villain of
[51:14] Bitcoin or he's just an idiot and I know
[51:17] he's not an idiot so I'm just like what
[51:19] what is this guy doing or he's or it
[51:21] could be he's stubborn too he's just so
[51:23] stubborn but he's done a such a
[51:26] disservice for so many precious metal
[51:29] stackers you know what I mean so I'm
[51:32] just
[51:33] like what would you say to to Peter Shi
[51:36] like uh I mean he has been in contact
[51:38] with so many bitcoiners at this point he
[51:41] has been uh kind of has this luxury
[51:45] situation to be in-person interviews
[51:47] where they probably talked before and
[51:48] after the interviews of off the camera
[51:51] with really highly intelligent
[51:53] bitcoiners and really uh great people
[51:56] people that orange build
[51:59] masses why does like as you said like
[52:02] it's fascinating how you not see it but
[52:04] is this something that you like I I
[52:06] would tell him this or this he probably
[52:08] does not understand or is it just like
[52:11] he's a marketer
[52:12] probably the first thing I would say to
[52:14] him because obviously we're not supposed
[52:15] to ask people how much Bitcoin they have
[52:18] but I would ask him I'm like Peter
[52:19] listen I'd pull him to the side and go
[52:21] Peter we know you got Bitcoin
[52:24] man how how much you got bro you don't
[52:26] have to tell me the exact number BR how
[52:28] much that's the first thing I'll say to
[52:29] him and if he you know depends on how he
[52:31] acted to me oh no I don't have I'm like
[52:33] Peter come on man you know you predicted
[52:35] the' 08 crash you know about sound money
[52:39] you know about the fed you know about
[52:41] everything you know Bitcoin is way
[52:42] better than gold and silver so again
[52:44] come on man let's drop that your son has
[52:46] some you know come on man look at look
[52:50] at when you said he said in I think in
[52:52] um I think it was Daniel cambon thing
[52:54] when he says or or the other girl he
[52:57] says oh yeah I would have love to keep
[52:59] Bitcoin you know but I I missed out but
[53:01] he knows about the Habs he knows about
[53:03] the supply issuance he knows everything
[53:05] I mean he know it's not like he doesn't
[53:07] know it people think he doesn't know he
[53:08] knows more than probably a lot of new
[53:11] bitcoiners does some I would really ask
[53:13] him like what's your point here man what
[53:16] what are you doing you know what I mean
[53:17] are you just marketing yourself because
[53:20] you know you're GNA do this big like he
[53:22] did with the April fools thing remember
[53:24] he did when he came out and did all that
[53:25] stuff
[53:27] I don't know I don't know man but again
[53:28] he he's done a he's done a big
[53:29] disservice to a lot of people even if he
[53:32] uh whether he's doing it on purpose or
[53:34] not because there's still a lot of
[53:35] precious metal guys that just cannot get
[53:37] over all the talking points that he says
[53:39] and the reason why I know that they
[53:41] listen to him because when they tell me
[53:42] something they're saying ex the exact
[53:44] same things that he says either they get
[53:46] it directly from him or those big gold
[53:49] and silver influences they listen to
[53:51] that got it from him right so again I
[53:53] just think he's doing a big disservice
[53:55] but the main thing about precious metal
[53:57] stackers getting back to them is I they
[53:59] already know right they already know
[54:01] that the system is broken they know that
[54:03] the money system is just corrupt and
[54:06] everything they know everything but
[54:07] they're using the wrong tool right so
[54:10] when I did it I used to compare it to
[54:12] being like in an army we're fighting
[54:14] against the Fed so we're the Air Force
[54:16] you guys are the ground force and you
[54:18] know we need both right that's what I
[54:19] used to think but then the more and more
[54:21] I got into I'm like we we only need
[54:24] Bitcoin and satoshi's but I don't try to
[54:27] you know get them all they have to learn
[54:28] and and get go through that process and
[54:30] again it takes years to do it but at
[54:32] first you got to understand that there's
[54:34] a difference between the first thing I
[54:36] do is talk about the difference between
[54:38] crypto and Bitcoin crypto is not Bitcoin
[54:40] and and Bitcoin is not crypto that's the
[54:42] first thing I say then I try to move him
[54:44] into satoshi's try to teach them about
[54:46] the digital money how it's not a
[54:48] Honeypot how it is real how it's not
[54:52] only just scarce but it's finite I show
[54:54] them the difference between uh the
[54:56] supply issuance of hey this how many
[54:59] Bitcoins were mine today you know it was
[55:00] 900 today in the epoch 4 now it's going
[55:03] down to 450 a day and then this how many
[55:06] every 10 minutes
[55:07] 6.125 or 6.25 down to 3.125 every 10
[55:11] minutes can I ask you a question that's
[55:13] why I say to the precious metal stackers
[55:15] how many gold ounces are out there right
[55:17] now you may have a guess you know you
[55:20] could guess how many gold ounces were
[55:23] mined today how many going to be mind
[55:26] tomorrow and the day after and the day
[55:28] after they don't know right and I tell
[55:30] them I say look not for nothing
[55:31] technolog is getting better the only
[55:33] thing the reason why gold is scarce is
[55:35] because our technology is not up to par
[55:37] yet we have to once we get up to the
[55:40] technology where when the price starts
[55:42] shooting up because it has been going up
[55:43] a little bit gold and silver and
[55:44] congratulations to that by the way but
[55:46] when the price starts going up what's
[55:47] going to happen Robin more people are
[55:49] going to say we got to up this
[55:51] technology we got to get our gold right
[55:53] when the demand goes up when the when
[55:55] the price goes up that means their their
[55:57] technolog is going to start going up and
[55:58] the supply uh is going to start going up
[56:01] because they're going to find it in the
[56:03] sea they're going to find it in
[56:04] different Caverns they'll go on an
[56:06] asteroid belt here in the next couple of
[56:08] decades and that's the difference you
[56:10] can't do any of those things with
[56:12] Satoshi in Bitcoin you can't go under se
[56:14] you can't make any more of it and I when
[56:17] I explain that to them they'll look at
[56:19] me sometimes they go okay well let me go
[56:21] to the silver shop and get me some
[56:22] silver now I'm just like so it's tough
[56:25] you know what I mean but I've been I've
[56:27] been breaking them down I've been
[56:28] working on it so I got a long ways to go
[56:31] yeah and it's fascinating when you also
[56:32] look at people like Frank chra and and
[56:36] and Peter Schiff who are the like bigger
[56:38] gold guys they don't even have a lot of
[56:41] gold themselves like they they publicly
[56:43] say oh I own like five or 10% in Gold
[56:47] they other like gold stocks and and
[56:49] other things and it's like okay do you
[56:51] want to be in the camp where the the
[56:54] biggest gold guys have like five perc of
[56:57] of of the netw worth in in gold or do
[56:58] you want to be in Camp where almost
[57:00] everyone in Bitcoin who's really a maxi
[57:03] has like plus 80% or everything except
[57:07] their own company and their own house in
[57:10] Bitcoin they're like of the liquid net
[57:13] worth they 100% in there some some like
[57:16] lunatics like me are over 100% in there
[57:19] uh so it's like in which Camp do you
[57:21] want to want to beach us from that
[57:23] perspective but if you look at the
[57:24] fundamentals if you look at the facts
[57:26] then that it's also getting really soon
[57:29] really um obvious what you do and what
[57:32] what what you what you should
[57:34] do yeah and that's what I say all the
[57:36] time I go look Peter shf tells you to
[57:38] get 5 per. Frank juer tells you to get 5
[57:41] per. all these guys tell you to get 5%
[57:43] the first thing I say is what do you do
[57:44] with the other
[57:45] 95% like you said the mining stocks okay
[57:49] okay get some Mining stock then what
[57:50] else do I do if gold and silver is that
[57:53] good and I'm not saying it's bad because
[57:54] people think I you know talk bad about
[57:56] it that why do you always say 5 per.
[57:59] sometimes I'll say 10 per. but with
[58:01] Bitcoin and Satoshi again I don't tell
[58:03] anybody how much to get but once you go
[58:06] down that black hole and you start
[58:07] learning you're gonna you're G to up
[58:08] your game and put anymore and again
[58:10] there is no second best so when I had my
[58:12] precious medals and my Bitcoin and I was
[58:14] going back and forth all I know is as
[58:16] time went
[58:17] on precious medals got less Bitcoin got
[58:21] more and again they never say what's the
[58:24] other 95% we should buy they never so
[58:27] and and that's one leged reason uh that
[58:29] I find to own precious metal uh I don't
[58:34] do it because of that reason I told you
[58:37] because I hold the coin but there's one
[58:39] leged use case that I find it reasonable
[58:43] when people come up to L that's the
[58:45] reason why I hold gold or I hold a
[58:47] little bit of silver and that's for the
[58:50] same reason that you might want to have
[58:52] a little bit of food in your house uh a
[58:55] little
[58:56] a gun or something like that in your
[58:58] house uh like have something a survival
[59:01] kit when the whole electronical system
[59:04] maybe breaks down for like a week or
[59:05] something I don't have this uh I don't
[59:09] plan for this uh but it would make sense
[59:12] if you have like a house at home and you
[59:15] have like some room where are some gold
[59:17] coins in there there are like talking
[59:20] about really small ones where you can
[59:22] spend them and exchange them easily uh
[59:24] you maybe have like food where you can
[59:27] eat for like a week or something like
[59:28] that that that could make sense for me
[59:31] like if someone does that it's it's like
[59:33] it's okay but that should not be even 5%
[59:36] of your network there should be like
[59:39] 0.5% something like that that's the only
[59:41] use Cas that I found maybe there's
[59:43] another one yes yes I I do have that
[59:46] stuff you know a little bit of that but
[59:48] this book right here I bought this a
[59:50] couple years ago the dark secrets of
[59:52] shtf survival this book shows you what
[59:56] actually happens during HTF and the most
[59:58] important thing you need is that stuff
[60:00] you talked about the food the ammo and
[60:02] stuff like that and in this book I was
[60:05] looking for precious medals because a
[60:06] lot of these precious metal guys they're
[60:09] doomsdayers right they're always ready
[60:12] for shtf and stuff like that and I tell
[60:14] people I go listen I love Precious
[60:16] medals my favorite is constitutional
[60:18] silver you know the dimes the quarters
[60:20] the old stuff 1964 and and and before
[60:24] and they think they're going to be
[60:25] Trading back and forth gold and silver
[60:27] coins and all this other stuff in this
[60:29] book right here it'll tell you it does
[60:31] mean it means nothing nobody cares about
[60:33] it there's only a small percentage
[60:35] because everybody says what if the power
[60:36] goes out you you know the thing what if
[60:38] the power goes out I go if the power
[60:39] goes out then you know you got your food
[60:42] you need some cash because that's what
[60:43] gonna accept some cash that's why I have
[60:45] a little bit of cash too and all the
[60:47] things that buy cash or B cash buys with
[60:49] it you know the food you know the ammo
[60:52] and stuff like that nobody cares about
[60:54] gold and silver first of all if they
[60:56] know about gold and silver how they
[60:57] going to know it's
[60:58] real that that's what I say to people
[61:00] all the time so again I'm not you know
[61:02] trying to excuse me on uh on
[61:05] precious medals but you got to be real
[61:07] realistic man because the future's
[61:08] coming and um again you can see the
[61:11] evolution of money you got the seashells
[61:13] you got the salt you got the precious
[61:15] metals here then you have the cash then
[61:17] you have the credit cards and the final
[61:20] one the final boss with the be is
[61:23] Bitcoin I love it so much and we already
[61:25] over one hour and I'm I'm I have so many
[61:28] more topics that I want to go in with
[61:30] you but uh let's let's come to that uh
[61:33] topic for one of the last ones uh before
[61:35] we end it today um where do you see the
[61:39] near future of Bitcoin like what do you
[61:42] expect uh to come in the next like five
[61:44] years 10 years do you have like any
[61:47] predictions even outs like outside of
[61:50] the the price because like price is
[61:51] pretty impossible to predict uh other
[61:54] stuff is also hard to predict but do you
[61:56] have any predictions where uh you see
[61:58] like that's or or something that you are
[62:00] looking forward that is exciting for you
[62:03] yes here in the United States I'm a I'm
[62:06] a I'm a patriot man I love my country so
[62:08] I'm going to talk about the United
[62:09] States first and I'll talk globally so
[62:12] the United States we're very uh spoiled
[62:15] here because we are the world Reserve
[62:16] currency and I I honestly think and I
[62:18] know a lot of people don't like to talk
[62:20] about politics and stuff like that but
[62:22] the choice is clear to me who who we
[62:24] should vote for obviously um I'm voting
[62:27] for Donald Trump Donald Trump I believe
[62:29] he's not I I compare Donald Trump to
[62:32] Bitcoin in this aspect post first of all
[62:34] they're both they're both orange you got
[62:36] the orange man and the orange coin right
[62:38] right that's number one number two I
[62:41] believe they're both for freedom I
[62:43] believe Donald Trump is the guy that is
[62:45] going to because you know America no
[62:48] offense to anybody that's from another
[62:49] country America is the world leader of
[62:51] freedom and just the world leader in so
[62:52] many different things you know not just
[62:54] the global uh currency but just uh World
[62:57] Reserve currency just the the trends and
[62:59] everything else it's just you know you
[63:00] guys know and so I believe Donald Trump
[63:03] um voting him in within the next four
[63:06] years obviously and you know five years
[63:08] after that whoever takes over for him I
[63:11] believe I believe him when he says that
[63:14] uh not only is he gonna vote in or put
[63:16] on a Libertarian in his cabinet and I
[63:19] got a couple people in the mind he
[63:21] should do that for but I think he's
[63:22] going to really understand that Bitcoin
[63:25] is the only way to fix the system now
[63:28] Donald Trump did print a lot of money uh
[63:30] during his ten years especially during
[63:31] covid um and I I don't you know take
[63:34] that anything away from that I know he
[63:35] did that uh but Joe Biden did worse and
[63:39] red or blue it doesn't matter they all
[63:40] print money but I believe Donald Trump
[63:42] and his staff and his staffers along
[63:45] with v remas swame i don't think he's
[63:47] gonna be his vice president but I think
[63:48] he's going to definitely been a good
[63:51] advisor to him because I think all the
[63:52] stuff that Donald Trump is talking about
[63:54] right now he got that v v ramma swam he
[63:57] got the original you know Bitcoin is you
[64:00] know I'm not going to measure Bitcoin
[64:01] and crypto I'm not going to have a cbdc
[64:03] and he said that he said that V RIS
[64:05] swame told me this he's my guy I want
[64:07] him to be president in 2028 but I
[64:09] believe uh right now uh the United
[64:12] States has over I think 180,000 Bitcoin
[64:16] I believe I think we have the most
[64:17] either that I've heard 180 to up to 210
[64:20] but I think they might have sold a
[64:21] little bit I think if Donald Trump was
[64:24] smart and he listens to his advisor and
[64:26] he sees what's going on with our uh with
[64:28] our Treasury and how much we owe and
[64:30] stuff like that what I'm looking forward
[64:31] to the most in the next four or five
[64:32] years I'm looking forward to him getting
[64:34] sucked into the black hole like we have
[64:37] and once he learns more he's going to
[64:38] realize like oh my God even though he
[64:41] wants to protect the US dollar he can't
[64:43] because it's inevitable it'll die it
[64:45] just will and I believe he's GNA look
[64:47] and say you know what we have this much
[64:49] Bitcoin we want to be the the leader of
[64:52] the
[64:53] world we got to buy some more Bitcoin
[64:56] the first country and we know this the
[64:58] first country to print money to buy
[65:00] Bitcoin
[65:01] wins and I and I hope and this is a big
[65:05] hope that we do that and with Donald
[65:09] Trump that's the only way we can that's
[65:10] short term now long term that's for the
[65:12] United States now long term and then
[65:15] obviously more people because of
[65:16] inflation in the United States more
[65:17] people are going to start buying it and
[65:19] as's a price goes up people are going to
[65:20] start discovering and stuff like that
[65:22] and find our videos right but 10 years
[65:24] plus in the world I believe uh the poor
[65:28] second uh uh third world country second
[65:31] world third world countries I believe
[65:33] are going to be adopting Bitcoin because
[65:35] not because they want to or uh they
[65:37] think it's good it's because they have
[65:39] to they have no choice and there's
[65:41] countries that's doing that now but I
[65:43] believe um we are early early early in
[65:46] the adoption phase but I believe uh
[65:48] Bitcoin is going to not only change the
[65:51] world but save the world fix the money
[65:54] fix the world we all know that and I
[65:56] think and I believe that worldwide
[65:59] worldwide that Bitcoin will be the
[66:02] standard uh in the next few decades
[66:04] maybe 15 20 25 years or something like
[66:06] that I believe it's it's just going to
[66:08] be I don't know when when it's going to
[66:09] happen but that's my prediction 15 to 25
[66:11] years uh and I believe the world uh
[66:15] third world countries that are just
[66:16] absolutely desolate and just losing all
[66:19] their purchasing power and then these
[66:20] people sending money back and forth and
[66:22] with money Graham and Western Union and
[66:24] stuff like that they can actually start
[66:26] saving in a digital money on a on a
[66:28] little small phone if you have the
[66:30] connection to the internet anywhere in
[66:32] the world you combine crypto
[66:35] cryptography and the internet together
[66:38] and make the best uh man the best
[66:41] technology ever in Bitcoin in my opinion
[66:43] and uh not only to uh save people's
[66:46] lives but save the future Generations
[66:48] lives so that's what I'm looking forward
[66:49] to man I'm looking forward to the
[66:51] adoption of people learning about it and
[66:52] people more people like me and you just
[66:54] sprouting out out of everywhere
[66:56] and um just changing the world together
[66:58] no more Wars and everything else I love
[67:01] that so much it's a it's a great great
[67:04] way to to say it and a great way to to
[67:06] end the podcast but before we come uh to
[67:09] the end of the podcast uh we have to end
[67:11] routine uh with the first question being
[67:14] what are you currently passionate about
[67:17] which we did not cover in the podcast
[67:19] and uh besides Bitcoin like what are you
[67:22] outside of what you talked about and and
[67:24] outside of uh Bitcoin passionate about
[67:27] or deeply learning about and the
[67:28] background to that question is um I
[67:31] think bitcoiners are amazing people and
[67:34] they are deep thinkers and critical
[67:36] thinkers uh and it's and this is the one
[67:39] question where I'm like trying to give
[67:42] uh a stage to all the great things
[67:45] bitcoiners are doing so we can learn
[67:47] from each other yes well outside of
[67:51] Bitcoin I had to think about that for a
[67:53] seconds I'm so passionate about Bitcoin
[67:54] but as you as you can see I'm a I'm a
[67:57] patriot and I love my country and I'm
[67:58] very passionate about uh my country I
[68:02] have here uh the US
[68:04] Constitution um Declaration of
[68:08] Independence uh that's why when I read
[68:10] the white paper it was like that email
[68:13] that first email that came out reminded
[68:14] me of the Declaration of Independence
[68:16] and
[68:17] um in the Constitution you know with the
[68:20] with the white paper it's kind of like
[68:22] we declared our independence from the
[68:25] the the the monetary system and I
[68:26] believe uh you know Bitcoin is as
[68:29] American as American Pie but the thing
[68:32] that I'm so passionate about is uh
[68:34] having people in America combining
[68:36] Patriots here in America not only to
[68:38] wake up people from the lies and the and
[68:40] the and the propaganda and the
[68:42] mainstream media the state state
[68:44] organized media to wake them up from the
[68:47] lies uh but also to have them take a
[68:49] look at Bitcoin so I have to I have to
[68:51] know and understand that again I know
[68:54] that we have the goggles on and I have
[68:55] the goggles on and I can't unsee what I
[68:57] see and I have to be patient to try to
[69:00] wake these people up because they're not
[69:01] going to see what I see all the time so
[69:04] I'm very very passionate about my
[69:06] country my freedom Jerry loves freedom
[69:09] and
[69:10] uh the Tyranny here in the in the world
[69:13] and in our in our country I'm very very
[69:15] passionate about the United States and I
[69:17] want Donald Trump to win the uh win the
[69:18] election and take our country back yeah
[69:21] I think I mean from outside perspective
[69:23] I think he has great chances to
[69:25] uh I think he is uh I mean if that one
[69:29] guy got that question uh in in my
[69:32] podcast uh who who do who does he think
[69:35] that wins the US election he's like and
[69:38] he said like if Donald Trump gets to the
[69:40] election he will be voted in something
[69:43] like that so I I also think that he has
[69:47] the he he probably will be president of
[69:49] the United States again uh in what is it
[69:52] November
[69:53] December yes and one more thing about
[69:55] Donald Trump that I forgot to say is
[69:58] that another reason I compare him to
[70:00] bitcoin obviously the orange thing but
[70:02] also when people call because Bitcoin is
[70:05] technically a cryptocurrency and Donald
[70:08] Trump is technically a politician
[70:11] Bitcoin is not crypto and Donald Trump
[70:13] is not a politician you know he's a he's
[70:15] a multi-billionaire yes he became the
[70:17] president he became technically a a
[70:19] politician but just like Bitcoin they
[70:22] got so many similarities they want
[70:23] freedom you know they're both both
[70:25] orange they're not politicians they're
[70:27] not cryptocurrencies and I believe both
[70:29] of them can change the
[70:31] world amazing then we come to our last
[70:34] endro team where the previous guest is
[70:36] asking a question uh for the next guest
[70:39] without knowing who the next guest
[70:40] actually is and the question for you is
[70:43] what are you planning to do to level up
[70:45] in the Bitcoin Community just being
[70:47] consistent uh I have to start with me
[70:49] and I have to keep reading books every
[70:51] day uh learning listen to the podcast
[70:55] and uh making videos every single day
