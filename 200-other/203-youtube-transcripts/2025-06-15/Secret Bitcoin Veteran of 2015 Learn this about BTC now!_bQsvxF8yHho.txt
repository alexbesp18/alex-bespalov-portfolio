[00:00] since taking credit is a form of taking
[00:03] I'm writing under a pseudonym I bought
[00:05] nearly all my Bitcoin at the start of
[00:07] two 2015 and my cost basis was well
[00:10] under $300 a coin I'd known about the
[00:13] national debt and theat uh monetary
[00:16] systems for 30 years and knew that it
[00:18] was all a house of cards and all of a
[00:21] sudden I I'm like wow there is a new way
[00:23] of holding scarcity that is really pure
[00:26] Bitcoin is incredibly cool it's
[00:28] incredibly important
[00:30] it is the most important technology of
[00:33] our
[00:35] lifetimes and I should call you I think
[00:38] Donald you said on the
[00:41] website yeah yeah that that would be
[00:45] fine perfect or or Mr comply I don't
[00:49] know what any whatever you prefer then
[00:52] Mr comply I think that's that's an
[00:55] amazing
[00:57] name then uh hello Mr
[01:01] well hello there I love by the way you
[01:04] handle like do not comply because it's
[01:06] uh it goes in this whole thing of self-
[01:09] sovereignty of Bitcoin helping us being
[01:11] more free and you also have like an
[01:13] amazing pin tweet I want to get too
[01:15] because you said like Bitcoin does not
[01:17] fix everything but it's fix the
[01:19] foundation of everything um maybe let's
[01:22] start there like how does Bitcoin help
[01:25] us be more Sovereign be more free be
[01:27] more in our being and what can we do
[01:31] Beyond being uh in
[01:34] Bitcoin well gosh uh you know the topic
[01:37] that we're getting into that I mean
[01:38] you're really starting with the with the
[01:40] heavy artillery I think uh the um I I
[01:45] would say just to try to summarize My
[01:50] Views about what
[01:53] Bitcoin creates and encourages is the
[01:56] fact that um you know most systems
[02:00] you've ever been part of and most games
[02:02] you've ever played you can there's
[02:04] always an incentive and an ability to
[02:07] cheat in some way and there just seems
[02:11] to be something intrinsic to bitcoin
[02:14] where if you play by the by we're
[02:17] playing by the rules is the only way to
[02:19] go because you've got uh such an
[02:23] extraordinary amount of uh proof of work
[02:27] behind it that uh there's really no way
[02:30] to jump outside of the constraints of
[02:33] how the system is supposed to work so
[02:36] um you know I I I think there's just
[02:39] something about Bitcoin that shines a
[02:44] light on uh on behavior that is less
[02:48] than virtuous and especially if you've
[02:50] been part of the Bitcoin world for many
[02:54] years you just regularly see people
[02:58] become prominent and then like they do
[03:02] something that is just totally not cool
[03:04] and the community realizes it and those
[03:07] people just are
[03:10] unceremoniously uh uh uh you know their
[03:14] their star no longer continues to rise
[03:16] let's put it that way so um you know so
[03:21] it's just a remarkable thing that that I
[03:23] think Bitcoin is unique in rewarding
[03:26] virtuous behavior and spotlighting uh
[03:30] despicable Behavior or or behavior
[03:32] that's even uh less than honorable and
[03:35] and uh and the longer you're in it the
[03:39] more you see how true that is yeah um
[03:44] maybe before we get into your whole
[03:46] Bitcoin story and how did you discover
[03:48] it and how why it's meaningful to you in
[03:50] in in more ways why did you choose to
[03:53] stay Anonymous like I think it's an
[03:55] really honorable thing to do uh because
[03:57] basically you're putting out Bitcoin
[03:59] coin education you're putting Bitcoin
[04:01] out without uh taking credits on your
[04:04] person it's like an an an eag less thing
[04:07] to do um why did you do that in the
[04:09] first place well I I think I think what
[04:12] I wrote on the front page of my site
[04:16] actually answers that question better
[04:18] than I can do extemporaneously so let me
[04:21] if you don't mind let me uh read this to
[04:23] you that's just a couple of paragraphs
[04:26] uh okay so right now this site exists
[04:29] solely for the sake of Hosting my
[04:31] Bitcoin Basics essay eventually I might
[04:34] write about other things I care about
[04:36] such as privacy authoritarianism and
[04:39] other fun topics if when I do I'll
[04:41] revise this front page to feature my new
[04:43] stuff for now I'll just say that this
[04:46] site is all about giving and asks for
[04:48] nothing in return I'm running it in the
[04:51] most principled way I know how there are
[04:54] no popups no ads or affiliate links not
[04:58] even any cookies I even refuse to use
[05:01] Google analytics opting instead for the
[05:03] Privacy respecting and cookie free burst
[05:06] statistics plug-in for WordPress and
[05:10] since taking credit is a form of taking
[05:13] I'm writing under a pseudonym I pay for
[05:16] hosting out of my own pocket and make no
[05:19] attempt to monetize this website or any
[05:21] of its writing and then I say where you
[05:23] can find me on noer and on Twitter and I
[05:26] have a page for my podcast appearances
[05:29] of which
[05:30] uh this podcast will uh soon be added as
[05:34] soon as the show goes live so anyway I
[05:36] think that kind of explains my
[05:39] orientation and at least part of why I
[05:42] chose a pseudonym and of course the
[05:44] other part is that I'm a relatively
[05:47] early hodler I bought nearly all my
[05:50] Bitcoin at the start of two
[05:53] 2015 and my cost basis was well under
[05:56] $300 a coin so um I have enough things
[06:01] to worry in my life and I have kind of a
[06:04] an alternate career where I'm kind of
[06:07] known and and prominent so it's like you
[06:11] know just just not uh having my identity
[06:15] put out uh because I am a hodler and
[06:19] because i' I'm kind of early to the game
[06:22] uh just makes sense from an operational
[06:24] security point of view I think yeah it's
[06:28] an amazing ass saw it also with some uh
[06:30] people like Gigi in in Germany where he
[06:33] in the beginning he was uh normally on
[06:37] uh Con on meetups and everybody saw his
[06:41] face but at some point he chose to be
[06:43] completely uh private with like his suit
[06:46] on and and as we as we know him and I
[06:49] think different people choose different
[06:52] paths like um what like for example what
[06:56] can everybody do to like improve privacy
[07:00] like in how much privacy is is is enough
[07:02] for like the the the person that maybe
[07:05] does not who wants to get out there who
[07:08] wants maybe even put the face on like
[07:11] the Bitcoin story but still wants to
[07:14] protect the Privacy like do you have any
[07:16] recommendations uh for people like that
[07:18] I mean they cannot deny that they have
[07:20] Bitcoin kind of uh but do do you have
[07:23] any recommendation for for example
[07:26] me uh in in terms of establishing a
[07:30] little more
[07:32] privacy while having your actual name
[07:35] out there not not really because I think
[07:38] once once you you know once your name is
[07:41] out there it's you kind of have to go to
[07:44] some uh extreme lengths to to lock
[07:48] things down uh you know so it's I I you
[07:54] know I've
[07:55] been spending every day reading up on
[07:59] bitcoin for well over five or six years
[08:03] before I felt called to do anything in
[08:06] the Bitcoin space and uh you know so by
[08:11] then for me anyway I I kind of chewed on
[08:15] this for long enough that I realized
[08:17] that uh you kind of need to decide
[08:20] before you even start out are you going
[08:23] to put your name out there you know I'm
[08:25] sure I'm sure that it would take just a
[08:27] little bit of Googling
[08:29] based on the story you told me about
[08:31] Gigi for me to find his last name and to
[08:35] learn some you know stuff about him even
[08:38] though that that's something he clearly
[08:40] doesn't want and so like if if if you
[08:44] enter the public Bitcoin world as a
[08:48] pleed and you've divulged your first and
[08:50] last name I I think at that point it's
[08:52] kind of game over but um you know on the
[08:56] other hand uh you know somebody like you
[09:01] know somebody like you Robin you know uh
[09:06] that's probably not that big of a deal
[09:08] because the likelihood of you becoming
[09:11] you
[09:12] know comparably well known as people
[09:15] like Lynn Alden or Michael sailor or
[09:18] Trace mayor or uh Andreas Antonopoulos I
[09:23] mean the likelihood of that happening is
[09:25] is probably very small so you're very
[09:29] far down the line of uh I think having
[09:33] anything significant to to worry about
[09:37] um but you know having having said that
[09:40] you know I I think a little bit of
[09:42] operational security is always
[09:44] appropriate even if if you're kind of
[09:46] well known I mean I would never go out
[09:49] in public wearing a Bitcoin t-shirt are
[09:52] you kidding me it just it just makes no
[09:56] sense at all it's like you might as well
[09:58] go out and public with a with a Target
[10:00] on your back you
[10:02] know and the only uh Bitcoin merch I
[10:05] have are socks and you can only see that
[10:08] they are Bitcoin socks if I have uh if I
[10:11] put my jeans
[10:13] up and and the thing also I have is the
[10:17] the Bitcoin hat but I basically never
[10:19] wear it so it's just there for for the
[10:22] for the YouTube video and in public you
[10:24] you never see the D and um I mean also
[10:28] like I think as you said it I it's kind
[10:30] of you go under the flow of Bitcoin
[10:34] influences because more and more people
[10:35] are coming up and and and speaking about
[10:37] Bitcoin and there are more Bitcoin
[10:39] podcasts coming up there are more
[10:41] Bitcoin uh posters bloggers vloggers
[10:44] whatever coming up and you kind of in a
[10:47] sea of people but of course if if people
[10:50] really want to attack me like I have a
[10:52] lot of material online they can really
[10:54] look into me and they kind of find out
[10:58] stuff about me but yeah it's it's it's a
[11:00] risk I I took uh um kind of
[11:05] intentionally because uh I wanted to get
[11:08] my name out there and I wanted to uh
[11:11] associate myself also with Bitcoin but
[11:13] yeah it's something that we have to live
[11:15] with it it would now I need to say that
[11:19] uh I was pretty prominent in my regular
[11:24] lifetime uh career before I got into
[11:28] this
[11:30] and I think part of why I was willing to
[11:32] be anonymous is I've had all the I've
[11:35] had all the attention and all the paths
[11:37] on the back that uh a person needs for
[11:40] an entire lifetime so I really didn't
[11:43] care about whether anybody recognized
[11:47] that uh who I was or what i' done in the
[11:52] world in the world of Bitcoin because I
[11:54] you know I'm I I I've already got I've
[11:56] already received so much attention for
[12:01] other things I've done in life um the
[12:05] U let's see the the
[12:08] um the thing to be you know really
[12:12] focused on I think is is just to realize
[12:16] that you know there's there there's more
[12:19] people coming in and there's a real
[12:22] disadvantage to working under a
[12:25] pseudonym or working anonymously it's
[12:28] it's it for me it was all it turned out
[12:30] to be much much much harder to uh get
[12:35] initial attention for my work uh because
[12:38] I was starting out as a complete unknown
[12:41] I couldn't leverage my identity in my
[12:43] existing career and uh so I I kind of
[12:48] had to start from zero I very much feel
[12:51] like had I had my Bitcoin Basics essay
[12:55] had I been able to come out with
[12:56] something like that in 2016 I would have
[12:59] become one of the better known people in
[13:03] Bitcoin but the fact that I came out
[13:05] with it in
[13:07] 2023 uh and did it under a pseudonym it
[13:12] has taken me an enormous amount of work
[13:14] to get a relatively small amount of
[13:16] attention even now um only about 4,000
[13:20] people have read the piece and if it
[13:22] weren't for uh if it weren't for
[13:25] Gigi who was the first person to tweet
[13:28] about it if it weren't for John Bas who
[13:30] was the first person to have me on a
[13:32] podcast if it uh weren't for the uh Swan
[13:36] Bitcoin post uh people uh featuring me
[13:39] in their daily newsletter if it weren't
[13:41] for those things
[13:43] um the that piece would have just been
[13:46] dead and died on the vine so
[13:50] um I I am it it it worked out uh fine
[13:56] for me you know to have done this under
[13:58] a pseudonym but it took a whole lot of
[14:00] extra work uh to get this piece to have
[14:04] any attention uh I'm really delighted
[14:07] though that uh even though it's only had
[14:11] about 4,000 views it seems to have
[14:13] inspired a lot of passionate uh response
[14:17] I mean to the point that it has uh
[14:21] people have felt called to translate it
[14:23] into Spanish and into
[14:27] Italian and uh and into French so it's
[14:32] now in four languages uh and that's
[14:35] without my even trying to make that
[14:37] happen people just went out and did this
[14:39] because they felt like uh um you know
[14:43] the coverage for a Bitcoin introduction
[14:46] in those languages was insufficient and
[14:49] so they felt called to uh to translate
[14:52] my piece which was really an immensely
[14:55] rewarding thing to have happened it's is
[14:59] kind kind of a the biggest compliment
[15:01] you can make like oh it's in English I
[15:03] have to have it also in my local
[15:05] language to show it to uh my local
[15:08] community this is uh Beyond like the the
[15:11] first compl is like if someone reads it
[15:13] from front to back like if the whole
[15:16] thing from zero to to to down the line
[15:19] uh and then tweeting about it sharing it
[15:22] and then even uh translating it's like
[15:24] kind of the biggest compliment you can
[15:27] make someone um
[15:29] how did you discover Bitcoin in like
[15:31] actually the very end of
[15:34] 2014 um and uh uh what was funny about
[15:39] it is when I first discovered it the
[15:41] price of Bitcoin was around
[15:44] $325 and I was just sold I wanted to put
[15:48] uh you know the the overwhelming
[15:51] majority of my savings into Bitcoin and
[15:54] I got a coinbase account and I started
[15:57] putting orders in at the at the end of
[16:00] 2014 and what was really funny was that
[16:05] um I I put in this $5,000 order you know
[16:10] for uh gosh 13 or 14 coins whatever and
[16:15] and um I put the order in and I'm like
[16:18] okay now I'm gonna own you know 14
[16:21] Bitcoin and I was like very excited and
[16:24] the order was taken and then like three
[16:26] or 4 days later coin would email me and
[16:29] said that the order had failed to go
[16:31] through and I needed to try again and
[16:33] meanwhile the price of Bitcoin had
[16:35] dropped by 10 bucks so I tried again and
[16:38] another three or four days went by and
[16:40] it got rejected but the price of Bitcoin
[16:42] had dropped another 10 bucks and so by
[16:44] the time I was able to start placing
[16:47] orders my I I don't think I ever paid
[16:50] more than $300 for a coin and it kept
[16:53] dropping and over that month um I hate
[16:57] to say it but but
[16:59] um I I was running out of money I had
[17:02] the last $5,000 or so left and Bitcoin
[17:07] one evening in January of 2015 had
[17:11] dropped like $35 it dropped all the way
[17:14] down to like 230 bucks I put in I spent
[17:17] the last of my money on this order and
[17:20] that was the night that Bitcoin dropped
[17:22] all the way down to like
[17:24] $178 and by the time it was down there I
[17:27] had already my order and I was out of
[17:29] money I could have gotten a few more
[17:32] coins uh for the same amount of money
[17:34] had I only uh you know had I only timed
[17:38] things perfectly but I I actually bought
[17:41] Bitcoin on the day where it went to like
[17:44] I think it was a multi-year low by that
[17:47] point and then very quickly it it
[17:51] floundered back up and then it stayed in
[17:53] the 220s for an entire year like it just
[17:58] was
[17:59] it all of 2015 if you look at the chart
[18:02] it essentially stayed between $220 and
[18:05] $230 which was like $40 less than my
[18:09] cost basis so I was underwater with
[18:12] Bitcoin for an entire year and I
[18:15] remember during that time I met some guy
[18:17] who had bought in at
[18:19] $800 a coin and he was totally buming uh
[18:24] I don't know what I I only met him so I
[18:26] don't know if he had the fortitude to
[18:29] hold on but um I was underwater for well
[18:33] over a year um but I knew what I had and
[18:37] I really didn't care that I was
[18:39] underwater because as far as I was
[18:42] concerned
[18:44] um Bitcoin was either going to fail and
[18:48] go to zero or it was going to go to
[18:50] 10,000 like 10,000 was like the city on
[18:53] the hill at that point that was like the
[18:55] idea that Bitcoin could be $10,000 like
[18:58] I was convinced that it could be but I
[19:00] think that was as big as most people at
[19:03] that time could dare to could Dare To
[19:06] Dream um anyhow you asked me how I got
[19:09] into it and I had been staying in uh uh
[19:14] I had I have an old friend who who's
[19:16] divorced and who lives in Hawaii and at
[19:18] the time she had a couple of uh
[19:20] pre-adolescent children and her kids
[19:24] were uh uh with their dad in California
[19:28] and so she had her child's bedroom free
[19:33] and uh so I I said hey I really want to
[19:36] come back to Hawaii I'd lived there for
[19:37] a while so we worked out a deal that I'd
[19:40] pay her rent for a couple of months and
[19:42] and sleep in sleep in her kids room and
[19:46] um so one day I was uh I was just in the
[19:52] mood to I was hanging out I was like it
[19:55] was the middle of the afternoon I'm
[19:57] slacking off and I was in the mood to
[20:00] listen to podcasts and this was like uh
[20:04] Joe Rogan had was by then one of the
[20:08] biggest podcasters but he hadn't quite
[20:11] reached that you know uh inor enor the
[20:16] the uh you know the kind of Fame he has
[20:18] today but he was well known and I I'd
[20:21] like to show I've been listening to it
[20:23] from the beginning and um I want to I I
[20:27] decid I'd listened to a Rogan podcast
[20:30] and it had been a couple of months so
[20:32] there were at least 12 episodes that he'
[20:35] done since the last time I listened so I
[20:38] looked at the roster of different names
[20:41] and uh you know had I mean everybody
[20:46] from martial arts to m music to
[20:49] comedians you know trying to decide who
[20:52] I'm who am I going to listen to and uh
[20:55] among the recent guests was this guy
[20:58] with this uh crazy name Andreas
[21:02] Antonopoulos H you know what what kind
[21:05] of name is that just the name kind of
[21:08] grabbed my attention and I clicked on it
[21:10] and it's like oh wow this is about
[21:12] Bitcoin and I had known about Bitcoin
[21:16] for a few years by that point uh because
[21:19] I've been reading slash dot in 2012 2013
[21:22] I definitely thought it was kind of a a
[21:24] Beanie Baby novelty kind of thing and I
[21:27] could uh I I could see that it had the
[21:32] potential to get hot and I had Loosely
[21:35] followed it to a, bucks and then was
[21:38] really happy when it crashed because I
[21:40] figured maybe at some point I'll buy in
[21:43] uh but I really did not understand in
[21:47] any kind of deep
[21:48] way uh how Bitcoin worked I didn't
[21:51] understand proof of work I didn't
[21:54] understand that it was based on uh uh
[21:57] public and private key encryption I
[21:59] didn't understand you know really the
[22:02] essentials of uh what Bitcoin was and I
[22:07] certainly didn't understand uh the
[22:10] simplest and most important thing that
[22:12] there was a fixed uh supply of 21
[22:16] million
[22:17] coins and uh during this this podcast uh
[22:23] andreus I think
[22:25] masterfully explained some of the
[22:28] essentials and luckily for me um I had
[22:33] just enough of a
[22:35] background in a bunch of disciplines
[22:39] that I feel like I connected the
[22:42] dots uh right away like everything just
[22:46] snapped together for me like like a like
[22:50] a jigsaw puzzle uh
[22:54] and so um really by the end of that
[22:59] episode uh knowing knowing the things
[23:03] that that uh that Andrea said and and
[23:08] having having a background in some of
[23:10] these things and and knowing also that
[23:14] uh uh by this point I was around 50
[23:17] years old and I'd known that you know
[23:19] I'd known about the national debt and uh
[23:22] Fiat uh monetary systems for 30 years
[23:25] and knew that it was all a house of Cs
[23:28] and all of a sudden I I'm like wow there
[23:30] is a there is a a new way of uh of uh
[23:37] there there is a new way of holding
[23:40] scarcity that is really pure because hey
[23:45] there's only 21 million coins and I also
[23:48] have to say that that I
[23:51] realized uh how early I still was that I
[23:56] even though uh even though Bitcoin was
[23:59] by this point a few hundred a coin I
[24:01] could see right away that it was just it
[24:05] as long as it didn't go to zero it was
[24:08] insanely
[24:09] undervalued because uh you know at this
[24:14] point uh I I'll just say one thing
[24:16] there's 21 million coins and at $300 a
[24:21] coin uh you could you could buy one one
[24:26] millionth of the
[24:28] of of the world supply of Bitcoin you
[24:31] could buy 21 coins for barely
[24:34] $6,000 whereas at the time I think I
[24:37] think gold was like $1,500 or something
[24:40] and there's six billion pieces of gold
[24:43] or or there's six billion ounces of gold
[24:46] above ground gold so it's roughly one
[24:48] ounce per person around the world so if
[24:51] you just do a
[24:52] comparison uh you know you could buy 1
[24:56] one million this supply of Bitcoins were
[24:59] for barely 4 ounces of gold it was just
[25:02] like are you kidding me like like how
[25:04] can Bitcoin be
[25:07] $300 when when there's only 21 million
[25:10] pieces of this whereas a whereas an
[25:13] ounce of gold and there's s billion
[25:15] pieces of gold is $1,500 like I could
[25:18] see right away that it was just a matter
[25:20] of time that Bitcoin would be worth
[25:23] vastly more than an ounce of gold as
[25:26] long as it survived and I figured hey
[25:28] it's 2015 bitcoin's been around since
[25:31] 2009 it hasn't failed yet it seems like
[25:34] it's
[25:35] resilient um I suppose it could implode
[25:39] but I I think I readily understood that
[25:42] all the times that Bitcoin was thought
[25:44] to have failed Bitcoin itself had done
[25:46] exactly what it's supposed to do what
[25:48] had failed was a bunch of Ponzi schemes
[25:50] and M Mount gos which has nothing to do
[25:53] with Bitcoin itself and I think I think
[25:56] that you know things like that that were
[26:00] pitfalls to other people understanding
[26:03] Bitcoin I I just had enough background
[26:07] of
[26:08] cryptography of game theory of economics
[26:12] and uh just sort of critical thinking
[26:15] and common sense to just see
[26:17] through uh a bunch of the most common
[26:21] objections and as I said I think that uh
[26:24] Andreas offered such a masterful
[26:27] introduction C to the topic that uh I I
[26:31] kind
[26:33] of knew my way
[26:35] around uh enough to to make a to make a
[26:39] relatively informed decision that hey
[26:42] this is where I want to put the bulk of
[26:44] my assets and so really I I I did a few
[26:47] more days of research after that podcast
[26:50] listened to another one he had done
[26:52] earlier with Rogan and by that point I
[26:55] was uh uh by that point I was getting
[26:58] getting an account with uh coinbase and
[27:01] getting started uh uh uh moving my
[27:06] savings out of dollars and into
[27:09] Bitcoin it's fascinating because you
[27:12] said that you have like an backgrounds
[27:14] in like cryp in all those things that
[27:17] you need to understand Bitcoin and you
[27:19] all also have been like 50 years old
[27:22] when you went into Bitcoin how did you
[27:25] protect your savings before Bitcoin did
[27:29] you had a strategy before Bitcoin to
[27:32] counter the Feld monetary system and
[27:35] inflation did you wear in Gold did you
[27:37] wear in stocks what did you do before
[27:40] Bitcoin uh you know the work that I've
[27:45] chosen to do in my life is has never
[27:48] been lucrative uh for a while I was a
[27:51] tech writer but I just uh I I've just
[27:55] tried to do things in the world that I
[27:57] thought thought would make a difference
[28:00] so there's um to this day uh I have only
[28:06] there's only been one year that I made
[28:09] more than
[28:10] $50,000 so I uh I was uh I mean that's
[28:16] from my work obviously my Bitcoin
[28:18] investment has has done very well but uh
[28:22] as far as like earning money from my
[28:24] work I I have uh I I grew up I grew up
[28:29] very upper middle class but after I left
[28:32] College I uh uh really struggled
[28:37] sometimes I mean to the point that um
[28:41] um for a number of years
[28:44] I I you know to sort of save rent I
[28:48] lived out of a minivan and traveled
[28:51] around the country and kind of enjoyed
[28:52] myself and it was like um I suppose it
[28:55] was something like 50% homelessness and
[28:59] 50% uh just uh adventurous uh living but
[29:05] I mean it there was definitely a poverty
[29:08] component to uh to my decision making
[29:12] and
[29:14] um so uh I had
[29:18] done very well with my stock
[29:23] Investments uh I mean so I've been able
[29:27] to
[29:28] accumulate uh you know tens of thousands
[29:31] of dollars but that's that's not a heck
[29:34] of a lot of money when you're 50 years
[29:36] old uh and uh I just I think at the time
[29:41] I felt like uh I felt like this was
[29:46] Bitcoin was either going to go to zero
[29:49] or it would be uh a 50 or 100 to one
[29:54] return and I thought the odds were that
[29:57] it was not going to fail so uh it just
[30:01] seemed to me like um I won't say I yoed
[30:06] into it uh you know you only live once
[30:09] whatever I sort of did and I sort of
[30:12] didn't I I because I I thought that it
[30:16] was uh you know VJ VJ has this uh in the
[30:20] bullish case for Bitcoin he he has this
[30:23] wonderful term an asymmetric bet and
[30:27] long before I discovered Bitcoin and and
[30:29] heard that wonderful phrase uh or I'm
[30:33] I'm sorry long before I discovered his
[30:35] work and heard that wonderful phrase an
[30:38] asymmetric bet uh I may not have known
[30:41] the phrase but I recognized right away
[30:43] that it was an asymmetric bet that um
[30:47] you know this was something that if it
[30:50] as long as it didn't fail there would be
[30:52] at least a 50 to one payoff and so given
[30:57] the that was the case I I figured okay
[30:59] well I'm going to I'm going to just put
[31:02] what I have into this and I saw the
[31:05] logic of it and I uh whether it went up
[31:08] 50% or down 50% I didn't care I was
[31:12] going to huddle this thing and I was
[31:14] going to ride this thing either to zero
[31:17] or uh or you know to the moon and um to
[31:23] this day uh and it's now been uh it's
[31:26] now been seven years uh I have never
[31:30] parted with a single Satoshi I'm super
[31:33] excited to announce that this podcast
[31:35] just got the first ever sponsor I just
[31:39] started the podcast out like three
[31:41] months ago and now we have 21 Bitcoin as
[31:45] a partner for this podcast 21 Bitcoin is
[31:49] Bitcoin only from day one and did teach
[31:53] and preach self custody this is my Goto
[31:57] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[32:00] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[32:02] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[32:06] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[32:09] support this podcast use code Robin and
[32:12] click the link in the description I had
[32:15] already two guests on that were before
[32:18] 2015 2014 in uh Bitcoin and started
[32:23] really early on with their Bitcoin
[32:24] journey and they both said to me that
[32:27] they are now not buying anymore because
[32:31] they cannot uh um they cannot fedom that
[32:35] they bought at like so low prices and
[32:38] now they have to pay such a huge amount
[32:40] and they just like are you still buying
[32:43] Bitcoin are you uh what are what is your
[32:47] kind of setup now with with Bitcoin and
[32:49] buying and then holding on to
[32:52] it well I think I can give you a really
[32:54] good answer to that question uh and
[32:57] that's uh and that stems from something
[33:00] I cover in my essay there's an entire
[33:03] section in in my Bitcoin Basics piece
[33:05] where I talk about uh the phrase unit of
[33:10] account and so the idea the idea here is
[33:15] that um like I'm in Japan right now uh
[33:19] and let's let's just say Bitcoin did not
[33:22] exist let's just keep things really
[33:24] simple uh you know it might be
[33:28] convenient for me to just Shi shift all
[33:31] of my savings into Japanese Yen because
[33:34] that's the only money I'm spending but I
[33:37] know that the uh Japanese yen is likely
[33:42] to continue to depreciate against the
[33:44] dollar over time so even though I'm only
[33:49] spending Yen these days to the extent
[33:53] that I have uh fiat currency my unit of
[33:57] account is the dollar and I keep most of
[34:00] my I I only I only go and get Yen uh a
[34:05] few hundred dollars at a time when when
[34:08] I'm out of cash and I try to have as as
[34:12] few Yen as possible I try to never have
[34:14] more than a month or two's worth of
[34:16] Japanese Yen on me when I live in Japan
[34:21] in the same way though uh I
[34:24] also uh don't want to own
[34:28] and I try to keep my total amount of
[34:32] dollars between five and $10,000 I I
[34:35] don't like to I never want to have more
[34:38] than
[34:39] $10,000 because to me my my my true unit
[34:43] of account it's certainly not the
[34:45] Japanese Yen but it's also not the
[34:47] dollar my unit of account is Bitcoin so
[34:51] um what I can tell you is if uh is if
[34:56] you're appearance fee for this podcast
[34:59] was was $10,000 and I could expect a
[35:03] check in the mail tomorrow for $10,000
[35:06] for having me on this
[35:08] podcast you know what I would do with it
[35:10] of course I would cash it and I would
[35:13] put all of that $10,000 into Bitcoin
[35:16] because my unit of account is Bitcoin if
[35:19] I get if I get a
[35:22] windfall uh some unexpected wind
[35:25] windfall I'm still going to buy Bitcoin
[35:26] with it because it's my unit of account
[35:28] and I know that uh the
[35:31] dollar uh is is and and all the rest of
[35:35] the Fiat currencies like the the cliche
[35:38] that the dollar is the cleanest shirt
[35:40] and a drawer full of uh Dirty Laundry it
[35:43] is correct you know the dollar is the
[35:45] best fiat currency out there but it's
[35:47] still it's still going to Trend to zero
[35:52] and uh and that that reality gets
[35:55] clearer every day so um you know it
[35:59] doesn't matter that my cost basis was uh
[36:05] under $300 a coin my unit of account is
[36:08] Bitcoin so anytime I get a windfall it's
[36:11] going into Bitcoin and I I can I can
[36:13] continue this story uh because it always
[36:16] turns out to be a good move you know uh
[36:19] a year and a half after I bought Bitcoin
[36:22] Bitcoin had risen all the way to like a
[36:25] thousand bucks
[36:28] and I was uh lucky enough to get this
[36:31] really lucrative Consulting gig that uh
[36:36] was going to pay
[36:38] $2500 for just three days worth of work
[36:42] I was like okay you know I'm not going
[36:44] to turn that down that's the most money
[36:45] I've seen in in years so I took this gig
[36:50] and
[36:51] um I talked to the guy and we we were
[36:53] discussing Bitcoin and I was really
[36:56] urging him to get some of it and he said
[36:58] well do you want me to pay you for your
[37:00] consulting fee in
[37:02] Bitcoin and I was like yeah of course I
[37:05] do so so what happened was in two and a
[37:10] half days or three days in in uh
[37:15] 2016 I was I I earned
[37:20] $2500 which turned into 2.5 Bitcoin so
[37:25] in so now in hindsight in in three days
[37:28] I had earned
[37:30] $100,000 so even though the price was
[37:33] Triple what I bought my initial stash
[37:36] for it sure turned out to be a good
[37:38] investment um and I think right now like
[37:42] there is
[37:44] um I personally think there's a lot of
[37:47] upside right now I think this is where
[37:50] where price is concerned I feel pretty
[37:53] confident that we are at the start of a
[37:55] major bullet Market I think uh there's
[37:58] that um there's that guy Fred uh
[38:01] something or other uh who's been talking
[38:04] about uh Bitcoin ETFs and the impact
[38:07] they're going to have I'm forgetting his
[38:09] name but I hope you can put it in the
[38:11] show notes but he's um he has he has a
[38:15] really extensive background in finance
[38:17] and he's been talking about why the
[38:19] happening is is actually a relatively
[38:23] minor uh Factor this time around
[38:26] compared to the eventual impact of these
[38:29] ETFs and um I think we're at a point
[38:33] where there is a tremendous upside and I
[38:38] it seems like a lot of the conventional
[38:40] wisdom out there is that we're going to
[38:42] see $100,000 Bitcoin in the next year or
[38:45] so and I don't like I I don't really
[38:49] make price predictions but that I I
[38:53] think we're I I think we're on the brink
[38:55] of a really big runup I mean the only
[38:58] prediction that I really make and and
[39:02] certainly the only one I made in my
[39:04] essay is that you know price is set on
[39:07] the margins and we are going to have a
[39:12] supply shock with Bitcoin and I think
[39:15] the ETF and I think um a supply shock is
[39:21] a lot like drinking a milkshake you know
[39:23] you're you're sitting there with your
[39:25] straw and you're cont ly sipping away
[39:27] and every every sip you know it feels
[39:30] the same it tastes the same and you're
[39:32] sipping away and then all of a sudden
[39:34] you take one more Sip and it's gone it's
[39:37] gone your your milkshake has suddenly
[39:40] run out and I think that we're going to
[39:44] see that with Bitcoin where where um all
[39:49] the trading deviants have gotten rid of
[39:51] the last of their coins and there's just
[39:53] going to be there's always going to be
[39:55] Bitcoin available for sale but there's
[39:58] not going to be anybody to speak of
[40:00] selling entire coins at anything like a
[40:04] reasonable price and I think that um
[40:07] when the supply shock hits we're we're g
[40:10] to we I I I felt this for years that
[40:13] we're going to see a a a
[40:16] $10,000 day a $10,000 candle where where
[40:20] in one day the price of Bitcoin goes up
[40:22] 100 or or 10 10 grand and uh yeah I
[40:26] would
[40:28] uh if any of my close friends would like
[40:30] to bet a bottle of expensive scotch on
[40:33] that happening in the next five years I
[40:36] I would take that bet so um you know I
[40:39] think a supply shock is coming I think
[40:42] that it's really important that people
[40:45] think about unit of account and to
[40:48] choose your unit of account consciously
[40:51] instead of just making it whatever
[40:53] currency is uh is used in the country
[40:56] you were born in I think that's a crazy
[40:58] way to decide your unit of account you
[41:01] should that should be your decision not
[41:03] not based on where you were
[41:05] born um so yeah I hope I hope that's I'm
[41:10] I'm kind of rambling a bit over several
[41:12] topics but uh I hope this is responsive
[41:15] to some of what you're asking yeah
[41:17] that's that's amazing and it covers so
[41:19] many topics and you you also mentioned
[41:22] the the Bitcoin Basics articles and this
[41:24] was basically just the start of
[41:26] me contacting you to to be on the
[41:28] podcast because I I like the the article
[41:31] a lot and um you probably also orange
[41:36] pilled uh a lot of people along the way
[41:39] or at least you talked with a lot of of
[41:43] uh people along the way uh what is for
[41:46] you like the most effective way to
[41:49] explain someone Bitcoin like how how uh
[41:54] how does it make click for people the
[41:57] fastest or what what do you have as an
[41:59] an an experience or in Orange buing
[42:03] people okay so
[42:06] so I think I'm gonna give you an unusual
[42:10] response to this question and that
[42:14] is that um well it depends on your level
[42:19] of
[42:20] expertise like um I I think you know
[42:24] somebody like
[42:26] uh Andreas
[42:28] Antonopoulos somebody like Preston
[42:31] pish uh somebody like Marty bent uh
[42:38] could if they were sitting next to
[42:40] somebody on an
[42:42] airplane and had a couple of hours to
[42:45] just do it back and forth they could get
[42:47] into any topic that the person brought
[42:50] up and just give a personalized
[42:53] introduction uh that would be really
[42:55] effective I'd like to think that I could
[42:57] do that too but um but the truth is that
[43:02] I think that since Bitcoin is so
[43:05] profoundly multidisiplinary
[43:08] you know if you have if you have the
[43:10] technical skills you might not have the
[43:13] economic understanding if you have the
[43:15] economic understanding you might not
[43:18] have the communication ability to to
[43:22] sort of dumb it down and and say it in
[43:25] more accessible terms you know so
[43:27] there's it it really even even Satoshi
[43:31] himself herself itself once said uh that
[43:36] once complained that hey you know it's
[43:39] really hard to introduce somebody to to
[43:42] bitcoin because I have nothing to
[43:44] compare it to so if somebody is as
[43:47] brilliant as satosi had trouble
[43:51] introducing Bitcoin I I just want to say
[43:54] to most of your listeners you know hey
[43:57] what chance do you have I mean maybe you
[43:59] can maybe you have some gifts there but
[44:03] probably most people don't
[44:06] so what I would
[44:09] suggest is is is is instead of trying
[44:15] to uh trying to orange pill somebody
[44:20] through a series of uh uh through
[44:24] covering all these basic topics uh
[44:29] instead what makes more sense is to just
[44:32] use your Social Capital you
[44:34] know hey Robin I've known you since high
[44:37] school you know you you know we've we've
[44:40] been friends for a long time you know
[44:42] that I've done this this and this right
[44:45] you need to listen to me
[44:47] here it is worth investing five or 10
[44:51] hours of your time into Bitcoin and go
[44:54] and read this or go and watch this but
[44:58] but please you know we've been friends
[45:00] for this long and just take my word for
[45:03] it uh the very best thing you could do
[45:07] over the next week is to give Bitcoin
[45:10] five hours of your time oh here's a
[45:12] really good article and you know I would
[45:15] hope that some of your listeners after
[45:17] they read my Bitcoin Basics piece will
[45:20] make my article their default uh
[45:23] recommendation but you know
[45:26] my Bitcoin Basics piece uh is something
[45:30] you could read in a sitting but it took
[45:32] me uh about six weeks to write it is
[45:36] very very difficult to lay out all these
[45:40] complicated topics in a really simple
[45:43] way and and and also to
[45:45] choose uh what gets left in and what
[45:48] gets left out and and let me just say
[45:50] you know if you're talking to your
[45:52] grandma about the block reward you know
[45:56] uh you're going over her head probably
[45:59] uh you know your grandma may have
[46:02] attended MIT as a computer engineer so
[46:04] who knows but um it's just really easy
[46:07] to get too technical when you're talking
[46:10] to people and and I think that rather
[46:13] than try to I think I think that for
[46:16] most people it's it's h it's a mistake
[46:20] for them to try to explain Bitcoin
[46:23] because uh uh even if you do understand
[46:27] it you may not be able to explain it
[46:29] well and I think very few people
[46:31] understand uh all the essential topics
[46:35] well enough to explain them sufficiently
[46:38] and accurately and to be and to also
[46:41] know what what things are not worth
[46:43] getting into so in my Bitcoin Basics
[46:47] piece I made those hard choices about
[46:49] what to leave in and what to leave out
[46:52] and um yeah I'd be really happy if if uh
[46:56] if if more
[46:58] people uh adopted that as their default
[47:01] recommendation but whether you do or not
[47:05] uh I I feel strongly that the best
[47:08] strategy is to not try is for most
[47:11] people to to to never really try to go
[47:13] into the details about Bitcoin with
[47:16] anybody but instead to figure out what
[47:18] is my default recommendation for the
[47:21] best thing to read or to watch whether
[47:24] it's a a book or a YouTube video or an
[47:27] article whatever it is figure out the
[47:30] thing you're most comfortable
[47:31] recommending and then just to orange
[47:34] pill somebody just say hey you know
[47:37] Bitcoin is incredibly cool it's
[47:39] incredibly
[47:41] important it is the most important
[47:44] technology of of our lifetimes
[47:47] perhaps and there's really no better use
[47:50] of U of the next five or 10 hours of
[47:52] your time uh to to learn the very Basics
[47:56] as quickly as possible please go and
[47:59] read this please go and watch this and
[48:01] and just leave it at
[48:02] that I think it's a it's a great way
[48:05] because I I mean I have my name out
[48:08] there I'm on social media all my friends
[48:10] my family they all know I'm the the
[48:12] Bitcoin guy in the family I'm the
[48:14] Bitcoin guy in the friend Circle even
[48:16] though like most of my closer friends
[48:19] are also like have Bitcoin standard
[48:22] adopter like some of them are even 100%
[48:24] in like me but um I observed that it's
[48:31] best to like in the beginning I really
[48:34] wanted to orange pill everybody I was
[48:35] like talking with everybody I think this
[48:37] is the urge that everybody has
[48:39] especially in the beginning when they
[48:40] first get Bitcoin kind of uh and then I
[48:44] discovered that Bitcoin is coming no
[48:47] matter what I do like it Bitcoin does
[48:49] not me me in the in the sense and so I
[48:53] was just putting my stuff out there on
[48:55] the internet uh and putting it uh
[48:58] publicly available for everybody and in
[49:01] real life I don't bring Bitcoin up I
[49:04] wait till someone brings Bitcoin up it
[49:06] usually happens it happens now more than
[49:08] in one year ago and then if someone is
[49:12] interested then we can then I talk about
[49:15] Bitcoin so I my orange pilling advice is
[49:18] always orange pill someone that is
[49:20] interested in in it if it if he isn't
[49:22] interested it's hard to uh start
[49:26] interest in him like people maybe can do
[49:28] it like people are maybe really good
[49:30] Educators and good uh
[49:33] communicators um I tried it I'm I failed
[49:37] with some I succeeded with some but I
[49:39] usually just wait till interest is there
[49:42] and then I open them I welcome them with
[49:45] open arms and try to guide them oh
[49:48] there's a good article there's a good
[49:49] podcast there has a good book you can
[49:51] read uh and if you're interested in that
[49:53] and that uh it also depends like what
[49:56] his knowledge is like some are having
[49:58] the economical side because they're like
[50:00] a gold buck it was kind of the thing
[50:03] with my dad he always already understood
[50:06] gold so he he he needed more the
[50:08] technical side of it so that's uh that's
[50:12] always interesting to to see someone
[50:14] getting into Bitcoin and how they are
[50:16] getting into it um what I also see with
[50:19] people getting into Bitcoin is people
[50:22] are getting distracted by altcoins or
[50:25] shitcoins I refer to them um did you get
[50:28] uh distracted by it or why do you think
[50:32] people are getting distracted by it for
[50:34] me the same thing is with leverage
[50:36] people are like oh I have Bitcoin but I
[50:38] want to have like a big credit also now
[50:41] with with Bitcoin and they're getting
[50:44] 20x leverage all of the sudden what's
[50:47] your whole FS on this well I I cover I
[50:50] cover leverage uh in in the piece in in
[50:54] my Bitcoin Basics piece and I basically
[50:56] say don't do it and I I you know I think
[51:00] I quoted Caitlyn long in in my essay
[51:03] where um where she says like the
[51:06] quickest way for a fool in his Bitcoin
[51:08] to be parted is is leverage but um but
[51:12] uh as for shitcoins um I kind of fell
[51:16] into that trap in
[51:18] 2017 uh and that was during the but I
[51:21] think I had a better excuse than anyone
[51:23] would have now the block wars were
[51:26] happening uh secondary layers like
[51:29] Litecoin really hadn't been fleshed out
[51:31] or like I'm sorry lightning Network
[51:34] hadn't been fleshed out and um I could
[51:38] see that uh and and and I should say
[51:41] that uh I received a a you know uh the
[51:46] fork split of uh of Bitcoin the Bitcoin
[51:50] cash like this was something everybody
[51:54] received uh uh when when Bitcoin cash
[51:58] came out and to me this was like this
[52:00] really unwanted distraction because I
[52:04] wasn't sure which of the forks would win
[52:07] and I I was like it just seemed like it
[52:09] was just kind of felt like uh from what
[52:12] I could determine Roger ver was uh was
[52:17] uh not very bright and not and and he
[52:21] didn't strike me as terribly ethical and
[52:23] suddenly I had this coin that he and his
[52:26] uh cronies had created that I didn't
[52:29] want but I was afraid to sell because
[52:31] maybe it it wins out over Bitcoin I got
[52:35] rid of some of my Bitcoin cash and I
[52:38] felt like Litecoin was uh a better
[52:43] choice than Bitcoin cash for maybe good
[52:48] reasons uh I I but I I basically sold
[52:53] some of my Bitcoin cash and bought some
[52:55] Litecoin with it I I I never spent any
[52:58] of my real money on this uh in hindsight
[53:02] I wish I'd never purchased that Litecoin
[53:04] I wish I'd just gone and plunged that
[53:07] money into into purchasing more Bitcoin
[53:10] because I would have been way way way
[53:11] ahead like um had I done that any
[53:15] Bitcoin I purchased would have jumped
[53:17] six times whereas the Litecoin that I
[53:20] stupidly purchased fell by 50% and um
[53:24] you know whatever that was that that was
[53:27] probably my biggest mistake in Bitcoin
[53:30] but uh I never spent any of my own money
[53:34] on whitecoin I regret buying it and uh I
[53:39] certainly have never promoted it and I
[53:41] end my essay by acknowledging that I
[53:45] owned some and saying that it was a
[53:47] horrible mistake and uh yeah so I'm I'm
[53:50] very anti- shitcoin but I think that um
[53:56] I think to people who are kind of
[54:00] intermediate
[54:02] bitcoiners uh who who have you know a
[54:07] moderate amount of knowledge of Bitcoin
[54:10] the the uh altcoin argument was vastly
[54:15] stronger in 2017 during the Block siiz
[54:18] Wars than it is today like uh today we
[54:21] have the second layer Solutions and you
[54:25] know there's just there's just no reason
[54:27] for any altcoin out there the only thing
[54:30] I can think you can make any kind of
[54:32] case for is uh stable coins which have
[54:35] true utility but um then you always have
[54:38] to wonder are they really backed like
[54:40] they're supposed to be like I can
[54:42] totally I I don't think there's any way
[54:44] to argue that stable coins um do have a
[54:48] use case uh especially for people in in
[54:51] countries that have deflation um but
[54:56] as to all those other altcoins I I hate
[54:58] them all I think that they're cancer on
[55:01] bitcoin and uh one of my greatest Joys
[55:05] over the past year has been looking at
[55:07] the 12 month Bitcoin versus ethereum
[55:10] chart and just watching ethereum grind
[55:13] ever lower uh as uh ballic and his uh
[55:18] cronies try to come up with some shiny
[55:21] new use case for this uh coin that's in
[55:24] freefall
[55:25] um you know as I said as we said at the
[55:28] start of the show you know Bitcoin
[55:30] really points out the people who lack a
[55:32] moral compass and uh you know nobody
[55:36] lacks a moral compass more so than the
[55:40] people whove pre-mined
[55:43] shitcoins and are promoting them to
[55:45] enrich themselves U so I love to see
[55:48] those people
[55:50] fail it's a it's a a beautiful way to to
[55:53] to say it uh um for me I also went into
[55:58] altcoins and for me was the the block
[56:01] size War really important in bit Bitcoin
[56:04] histories uh and in the whole uh
[56:08] progress of Bitcoin becoming more um
[56:11] resilient also uh how was how important
[56:15] do you think was the the block size war
[56:17] in in the Bitcoin history and how did it
[56:20] U
[56:21] like guided Bitcoin through the to the
[56:24] re thing it is is now or was it
[56:27] resilient also before but it it just was
[56:29] kind of a thing that it has had to prove
[56:32] I think I think the the I mean so I I I
[56:36] know that there's one prominent book uh
[56:40] that's devoted to the blocksize wars
[56:42] that's supposed to be excellent I forget
[56:44] the the title of the book and I even
[56:46] forget the person who wrote it but uh no
[56:49] doubt that I mean this is not my area of
[56:52] expertise by a long shot I I don't know
[56:55] as much about the blocksize war as I
[56:57] should because I I don't I don't
[57:01] understand the technical underpinnings
[57:03] of Bitcoin as deeply as I should like I
[57:06] I really can't even tell you in any
[57:11] honest clear way what segwit does or you
[57:16] know I I know that it's it's part of
[57:18] what grew out of the blocksize wars but
[57:21] there's there's just a lot of technical
[57:23] things that uh that I'm not that
[57:25] interested in and that go over my head
[57:27] but um but I think I think uh in my
[57:32] understanding of the blocksize wars the
[57:35] the most important thing to come out of
[57:38] it was the fork split and the launch of
[57:41] Bitcoin cash and and then the later
[57:44] launch of
[57:46] bsv uh Satoshi Bitcoin satoshi's vision
[57:50] and watching these two coins pirate the
[57:52] Bitcoin name and claim to be the real
[57:54] Bitcoin and watching uh what was it
[57:57] Bitcoin was it bitcoin.com
[58:00] promoting Bitcoin cash as being the real
[58:04] Bitcoin in this really sneaky slimy way
[58:09] I I forget if it was bitcoin.org or
[58:11] bitcoin.com but you know there there was
[58:14] just what was done on one of those sites
[58:16] was just beyond the pale in terms of
[58:19] lacking Integrity uh basically tricking
[58:22] in people into thinking that uh bit coin
[58:25] cash bcash was the real Bitcoin but I
[58:28] think I think that that was
[58:31] um that that was the um in some ways the
[58:38] great attack on Bitcoin in terms of what
[58:42] we could ever uh hope to see in terms of
[58:46] a fork split and and so forth and just
[58:49] watching what happened both to bcash and
[58:54] to BS V over the next several years I
[58:57] mean there was a time I think I you know
[59:01] I think there was a week where bcash was
[59:05] was selling for about half the price of
[59:08] Bitcoin and for at least a year I think
[59:12] for a couple of years you could you
[59:14] could sell six bashes and get a Bitcoin
[59:18] like it you know it stayed as a very
[59:21] substantial portion of bitcoin's value
[59:24] for quite a while and um and I think
[59:28] that was largely because uh there were a
[59:31] lot of people like me out there who
[59:33] wasn't who weren't technically skilled
[59:37] enough to be 100% sure that uh bcash
[59:41] would would uh go down in flames and I
[59:44] think as the years passed and bcash
[59:46] ground ever lower I mean that that is a
[59:49] really satisfying chart to look at as
[59:51] well um you know I I definitely have
[59:55] this uh shot androy element of my
[59:57] personality where I just wish doom and
[60:00] destruction and uh uh you know I I hope
[60:04] all these old coins die in a fire and I
[60:07] just W like I just like watching them
[60:09] implode by one by one because you know I
[60:12] I just uh don't have U any respect or
[60:15] Mercy towards these these shitcoins uh
[60:19] but but yeah I think I think BOS and BSD
[60:22] were uh an un precedented form of attack
[60:26] on bitcoin that we will never see on
[60:29] that scale again I think there will be
[60:32] other attacks uh that I can't even begin
[60:35] to predict but watching how uh Bitcoin
[60:39] disemboweled these two
[60:42] competitors um is is at once immensely
[60:46] satisfying and immensely encouraging and
[60:49] instructive yeah it's it's the chart of
[60:53] especially bash and
[60:55] I I you use sometimes when like in in my
[60:58] replies there's sometimes actually
[61:01] people that still really heavily believe
[61:04] in in those coins and then it it just
[61:06] strikes me how someone can actually
[61:09] believe in that stories and it's it's
[61:11] still standing behind those coins even
[61:14] though it's so like in 2017 it's more
[61:17] understandable but now there's so much
[61:18] education on it there like so many also
[61:21] Bitcoin only podcast Bitcoin only
[61:23] education pieces really break it down
[61:26] why and not just saying it like really
[61:29] deeply breaking it down and also like
[61:32] just just a pure free market over the
[61:34] last years like the chart is like it's
[61:38] it's not even a close thing like it's
[61:41] it's for me really uh interesting to see
[61:43] that people are still believing and hang
[61:45] on to it um so heavily but yeah I think
[61:49] as you
[61:50] said but one one thing I I want to add
[61:53] also on top of all that is that uh the
[61:57] emergence the launch of bcash when that
[62:00] happened that was really before the rise
[62:03] of Bitcoin Twitter at that point the
[62:07] biggest online way to uh where where all
[62:11] the bitcoiners would communicate was the
[62:14] main Bitcoin uh Forum on Reddit and that
[62:19] ended up getting taken over by the
[62:21] Bashers so like you're one if if you
[62:25] were relatively new to the Bitcoin space
[62:27] and kind of only intermediate you would
[62:31] the bulk of the information you would be
[62:34] seeing about Bitcoin versus bcash would
[62:37] be leading in the bcash direction and uh
[62:41] you were essentially getting
[62:42] propagandized by the dominant um Forum
[62:46] channel on Reddit uh and and so it it
[62:50] made um I'm just glad there were people
[62:54] like Matt Odell out there uh who were
[62:58] who were uh being you know so direct and
[63:01] succinct and straightforward about why
[63:03] bcash was just an impostor coin and why
[63:06] it was destined to fail I uh I
[63:09] definitely uh want to buy uh Matt Odell
[63:14] the drink of his choice at some point if
[63:17] if we if i' ever lucky enough to meet
[63:19] him uh and there's there's other people
[63:21] of course I think Trace Mayer uh was
[63:24] really famous at that time for just uh
[63:27] kind of gloating about how any chance
[63:31] anytime there was a fork split with
[63:33] Bitcoin he would just sell the fork
[63:35] split and buy more Bitcoin and um you
[63:38] know so there's people who saw through
[63:41] the coinery even before the
[63:44] blocksize wars and were consistent all
[63:46] the way through but I will not say that
[63:48] in
[63:49] 2017 uh my knowledge was sufficient to
[63:52] to Really spot this and took it took it
[63:55] took an extra year or so before I could
[63:59] really look at bcash and and just feel
[64:02] in my bones that this coin had no future
[64:05] and was just going to grind down to zero
[64:08] um and uh you know it has I mean but it
[64:11] was not until
[64:13] 2017 I guess that I sold the last of my
[64:17] uh Bitcoin cash
[64:19] so it kind of speaks to the strength of
[64:23] of of Bitcoin that it went through that
[64:25] period and there was so many misinform
[64:27] out there there was so many as you said
[64:29] Bitcoin Reddit was was taken over by the
[64:32] p i I just don't know about the time
[64:35] because I went came into Bitcoin way
[64:38] later um so that that speaks to the
[64:41] strength of the monetary system
[64:43] basically for me um we having an end
[64:46] routine in the podcast where uh the
[64:49] previous guest asked a question for the
[64:51] next guest without knowing who who the
[64:53] next guest actually
[64:56] is and uh if if if you uh and your
[65:00] question is do you think circular
[65:02] economies are important for adoption and
[65:06] why and why not nah nah I don't think so
[65:09] at all um and uh yeah that's that's a
[65:13] hard no I mean it's it's nice in theory
[65:16] or whatever I guess but that's going to
[65:18] happen by itself when the time is right
[65:21] there's going to be technical advances I
[65:23] mean for Bitcoin to for Bitcoin I mean
[65:28] what matters now is is how good is
[65:33] Bitcoin at being a store of value uh now
[65:37] I mean if we're talking about countries
[65:39] like Venezuela and uh uh countries in
[65:43] Africa where the currency is is just
[65:47] collapsing uh then then yeah I mean as a
[65:51] day-to-day spending method then Bitcoin
[65:54] becomes truly important but um I mean
[65:57] for for people in in developed countries
[65:59] where the currencies are are stable week
[66:02] to week um it's it's frankly not a
[66:06] problem and you know the way I I have no
[66:11] doubt that if you and I go out for a
[66:14] beer in 10 years uh I I'll be able to
[66:19] whip out my phone and use use you know
[66:22] this really cushy excellent wallet and
[66:27] just pay for my beer at any at any bar
[66:29] we go to like that will happen but I
[66:32] think uh you know the thing that I see
[66:36] happening is that at some point like
[66:41] apple uses uh Apple introduces like its
[66:46] own Bitcoin wallet with some kind of
[66:49] secure element built into this in a way
[66:52] that you know Grant ma can use and and
[66:56] you know Bitcoin at that point is going
[66:59] to have its hot mail and AOL CD moment I
[67:03] I think you may be too young to remember
[67:07] when the internet really took off in the
[67:10] late
[67:11] 1990s uh but it all happened one year
[67:15] and that was uh like AOL America Online
[67:18] got really huge out of nowhere and this
[67:21] was like when people Subs subcribe to
[67:25] magazines and uh this one year anytime a
[67:28] magazine came in the mail there'd be a
[67:30] CD in it and and this was CD ROM was to
[67:34] get you on to AOL to Get You On To
[67:36] America online and and so like all like
[67:40] these discs were
[67:42] everywhere AOL just blanketed the
[67:45] country and everybody had at least five
[67:47] AOL discs you couldn't you know every
[67:49] time you turned around you'd have a new
[67:51] AOL disc in in in your latest magazine
[67:54] or whatever and um and so like the
[67:57] onramp to and granted it was shitty dial
[68:01] up uh internet or whatever but you were
[68:03] on the internet and AOL got you on and
[68:05] you were using a web browser and that's
[68:08] you know everything was uh you know uh
[68:12] something that your grandmother could do
[68:13] and get on the internet and then and
[68:16] then about a year or two later um you
[68:20] know hot mail came out and this was
[68:23] before it got purchased by Microsoft and
[68:25] for the first time somebody just using a
[68:27] standard web browser could get a free
[68:29] email address they didn't have to log
[68:32] into Unix and fire up uh Pine H you know
[68:36] the pine uh client or through the
[68:39] command line interface they could just
[68:42] open up a web page you know go to
[68:44] hotmail.com and uh have their free email
[68:47] account and uh yeah I mean Gmail turned
[68:50] out to be 10 times better eventually but
[68:54] it Hotmail was the first web-based email
[68:58] solution that was good enough and and
[69:00] suddenly you didn't have to be some
[69:03] dungeon Dungeons and Dragons computer
[69:06] science 17-year-old nerd to be on the
[69:09] internet you could you could be just a
[69:11] regular person and I and I think that in
[69:15] terms of your ability to walk
[69:19] around with a couple hundred dollars
[69:22] worth of bitcoin on your
[69:24] phone uh I mean I I I know there's
[69:27] wallets that can do that now and I I
[69:31] know it can be done but I think that
[69:34] Bitcoin is going to have like a hot mail
[69:36] moment an AOL moment where Apple like
[69:40] its biggest introduction for the iPhone
[69:44] in
[69:46] 2020x is is that it's going to be a
[69:49] Bitcoin enabled iPhone that is that
[69:53] inspires the same kind of confidence as
[69:55] a as a cold card uh because of
[69:58] breakthroughs and security and ease of
[70:00] use and at that point we can talk about
[70:03] circular economies and so forth but for
[70:05] now it's like much much more important
[70:08] than circular econ regular people to
[70:11] lock down some of their net worth into
[70:14] Bitcoin and to start thinking of Bitcoin
[70:18] as their unit of account that's getting
[70:20] easier by the day and and every month
[70:23] more and more people are shifting away
[70:26] from their fiat currency to bitcoin as
[70:30] their unit of account and and does it
[70:32] really
[70:34] matter
[70:36] whether the next beer that I buy you I'm
[70:40] I'm paying Bitcoin for it if both of us
[70:43] have 85% of our wealth stored in Bitcoin
[70:47] who cares about you know the the other
[70:49] 5% of currency or whatever who cares
[70:52] about how we're making payments I I I
[70:55] mean I'm not dismissing it totally but
[70:58] I'm saying that it's a problem that will
[71:00] solve
