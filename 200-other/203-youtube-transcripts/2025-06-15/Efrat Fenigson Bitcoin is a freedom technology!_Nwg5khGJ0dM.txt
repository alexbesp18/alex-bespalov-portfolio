[00:00] it's pretty crazy it's a [ __ ] show it's
[00:02] a pretty tough time is feat enabling
[00:05] this water it is heavily controlled by
[00:08] the fabric of society which is Fiat so
[00:11] it's like the oxygen we breathe is the
[00:13] fiat currency that we operate on and we
[00:16] don't stop to question how that system
[00:19] is designed how that system is operating
[00:22] whether it's for my benefit or not
[00:24] whether it's enslaving me or not whether
[00:27] it's serving a good purpose or not we
[00:30] just take it for granted you are going
[00:32] to be getting used to living an endless
[00:35] war because that's what the globalist
[00:37] powers want 70% of people in Israel are
[00:40] in favor of that war the state have made
[00:43] them feel like war is the best option on
[00:45] a Bitcoin standard we may not have
[00:47] central banks the power that the banks
[00:50] and the central banks hold will decrease
[00:54] Bitcoin startups have to be much more
[00:57] efficient and much more productive and
[00:59] much better at what they do than normal
[01:02] startups good and kindness exists in the
[01:04] world starting to see the broken
[01:07] incentive structure the way the doctors
[01:09] are behaving because of the incentive
[01:11] structures that they have towards the
[01:13] government towards the Ministry of
[01:14] Health towards the World Health
[01:17] [Music]
[01:20] Organization Hi afred how are you doing
[01:22] everything fine on your end everything
[01:24] is great on my
[01:26] end I mean considering the situation and
[01:30] where I live it's I'm all good I'm fine
[01:33] oh where do you live is uh I live in
[01:36] Israel oh man I didn't knew that how how
[01:40] is it uh over there right now it's uh
[01:43] yeah it's pretty crazy it's a [ __ ] show
[01:46] it's a pretty tough time for people yeah
[01:49] quite difficult for people who choose to
[01:51] live here and uh and and are aware and
[01:56] quite awake to everything that's going
[01:58] on in the world and
[02:00] and around here uh it's not easy because
[02:04] um yeah you see a lot you understand
[02:07] probably things that they're not saying
[02:10] but they're
[02:11] doing um and you're not falling to the
[02:15] propaganda so you can see through it and
[02:19] it's pretty difficult I mean I I am fine
[02:22] because I do a lot of work to kind of
[02:25] stabilize myself and and my close
[02:28] environment
[02:30] but many people around me
[02:32] are yeah suffering from various uh
[02:36] implications of this war this leads me
[02:39] uh perfectly actually to my first
[02:40] question is is fear enabling this Wars
[02:43] do you see it as uh something that is
[02:46] coming from Fiat or is war something
[02:50] human made well Fiat is
[02:53] human-made and uh and and the human
[02:58] nature if it is not contained and if it
[03:03] is not I think if if you don't as a
[03:06] human if you don't do work
[03:08] to try to improve yourself all the time
[03:11] it's very easy to be dragged down to the
[03:15] negative side of being a human with all
[03:18] the with all the incentives that you get
[03:21] out of doing things that are negative in
[03:24] life um and unfortunately I think that
[03:27] the modern society has been designed in
[03:29] such a way that the incentive structure
[03:31] for humans today is such that you get
[03:36] incentivized for doing things that are
[03:39] probably not good for Humanity and are
[03:42] better for corporations or for
[03:44] governments or for you know State
[03:46] control or even globalist
[03:49] organizations and I think that most of
[03:51] the people that
[03:53] are taking part in this uh negative um
[04:00] trajectory for Humanity are doing
[04:04] so while they are not bad people or they
[04:08] don't
[04:09] mean any evil intent or they don't have
[04:13] an nefarious goal behind how they behave
[04:17] or what they do most people I would say
[04:20] from what I'm seeing from what I'm
[04:22] researching and learning they're simply
[04:25] not engaged in any um sophisticated a
[04:30] deep conversation with themselves
[04:33] firstly and with the world secondly
[04:37] about the implications of what they do
[04:39] and how they behave in the world and
[04:42] they don't stop to think about the
[04:45] ripple effect that their existence has
[04:49] on the rest of humanity and so when you
[04:52] live like that in a way such s a little
[04:55] bit like an automatic pilot right you
[04:57] just operate without really thinking
[04:59] without really I mean you can think but
[05:02] you think about the easy things in life
[05:05] you don't stop to think about the harder
[05:07] things in life then it's very easy for
[05:10] you to fall prey to the traps that the
[05:14] modern Matrix puts in front of you right
[05:17] you you have an incentive to go work for
[05:20] someone you have an incentive to be a
[05:22] good citizen to pay taxes to participate
[05:25] in society in such a way that you will
[05:27] be a compliant citizen that um you know
[05:31] you won't Rock the Boat too much and
[05:34] create too much fuss because society
[05:36] would expect you to behave a certain way
[05:38] so there is an incentive for you to be
[05:41] aligned with Society with the state with
[05:45] the
[05:46] government uh W and with corporations
[05:49] and and so when you're so far down in
[05:53] the latter of decision making and
[05:58] actually um
[06:00] making creating any significant changes
[06:04] you're so far down the ladder that you
[06:06] don't really make a a real impact or a
[06:09] real difference in the world that you
[06:12] know that you can see tomorrow morning
[06:14] you'll say oh I'll change something
[06:15] small in my life that will create a
[06:18] significant change and therefore I'll do
[06:20] it like it's really hard to create a a a
[06:24] significant change immediately and so I
[06:28] think that it's way easier to just
[06:31] continue rolling with life the way
[06:33] they're designed the way it's designed
[06:36] without asking questions without trying
[06:38] to change things um as I said not not
[06:41] from a nefarious place but just from an
[06:43] easier place from a place of
[06:46] convenience and therefore you become you
[06:49] know just a small Pawn on the chess game
[06:52] of The Matrix and that Matrix the way I
[06:56] see it is heavily um controlled by uh
[07:02] the fabric of society which is Fiat so
[07:04] it's like the oxygen we breathe is the
[07:07] fiat currency that we operate on and we
[07:10] don't stop to question how that system
[07:14] is designed how that system is operating
[07:17] whether it's for my benefit or not
[07:20] whether it's enslaving me or not whether
[07:22] it's you know serving a good purpose or
[07:25] not we just take it for granted and just
[07:28] like the air we breathe it's the money
[07:30] we use right it's it's that very very
[07:33] basic fabric of life that is Fiat and so
[07:36] when we take it for granted you know so
[07:39] if if you take that as a first Principle
[07:41] as a basic assumption that everyone runs
[07:44] on the same oxygen the same Fiat without
[07:48] questioning anything and Fiat we know
[07:51] there is an equation that it
[07:54] incentivizes Wars because of the you
[07:57] know the the military industrial complex
[08:00] and the money that is being made when
[08:02] you go out to war when you conquer a
[08:07] land or an area but
[08:09] also when you have property rights over
[08:13] other
[08:14] areas and then after a war when you have
[08:18] to rebuild then you also get the Fiat
[08:21] machine working because you need more
[08:22] money to justify the building after you
[08:26] ruin something so the whole the whole
[08:29] system the whole structure is
[08:31] incentivized in such a way that war is
[08:35] like in a way something that stimulates
[08:38] the economy and it's a good thing and so
[08:41] I mean a good thing people know war is
[08:43] not a good thing but they they they are
[08:47] um naturally incentivized to go with the
[08:50] flow and to enable it because in the end
[08:53] of the day it's there are a lot of
[08:56] incentives to do it and so yeah so you
[08:59] know to cut a long story short I think
[09:02] that by taking Fiat for granted we
[09:07] also have grown to take Wars for granted
[09:11] and just like Julian Assange
[09:14] said you are going to
[09:16] be getting used to living an endless war
[09:20] because that's what the globalist powers
[09:23] want they want you
[09:25] to kind of think that it's normal to
[09:28] live and an end L war and when there is
[09:31] no war that is like your that is like
[09:33] the special time but you know your your
[09:37] normal life will be accompanied by some
[09:40] kind of a battle some kind of a war and
[09:43] I think many people got used to it it's
[09:45] not like we want Wars people know they
[09:48] don't want war but when it's here or
[09:52] when it's coming they are eating all the
[09:56] baits and falling for all the traps and
[09:59] believing all the excuses that they're
[10:01] being given for why this war is
[10:04] essential for why now we have to you
[10:07] know do this or participate in this and
[10:11] why they also have to sacrifice a lot of
[10:14] things in their lives to make it happen
[10:17] and and they do and so yeah I think you
[10:21] know if you look at the statistics now
[10:23] in Israel we are everyone knows you know
[10:26] we're like at the Casp of uh perhaps
[10:29] breaking another war with uh Iran or in
[10:34] the north of
[10:35] Lebanon and North sorry North of Israel
[10:38] with the south of Lebanon right on the
[10:40] border there with hisbah forces that are
[10:43] um that are funded by Iran so this could
[10:48] be a break of uh another um battle in
[10:52] this third world war that we're living
[10:54] right now I I just saw a statistic that
[10:57] is staggering for me that around about
[11:00] don't catch me on the exact number but
[11:01] around about 70% of people in Israel are
[11:05] in favor of that war of you know
[11:08] launching that battle with kisala and
[11:11] you think about it it's like 70% or
[11:14] maybe even more it's like most of the
[11:16] people in Israel are actually Waging
[11:20] War where when a lot of the people in
[11:24] that area in the North of Israel are
[11:26] uprooted from their homes for about 8
[11:28] months for nine months 10 months they
[11:30] don't have a normal life they are living
[11:33] in hotels or they're living in you know
[11:36] relatives house or whatever and their
[11:39] life is completely upside down and still
[11:42] they're like yeah bring on the war why
[11:44] because they feel unsafe and because the
[11:47] government and the and the state have
[11:50] made them feel like war is the best
[11:52] option and that's ridiculous in my eyes
[11:55] and it's not like I don't want Israel to
[11:57] protect itself I live here right I want
[12:00] protection but I you know I I look at it
[12:03] from a more zoomed out perspective of
[12:06] this whole War and who does it serve and
[12:09] why it's happening and yeah so it's it's
[12:13] very difficult and it's a very complex
[12:15] conflict and it's very hard to be
[12:17] deterministic about this whole situation
[12:21] um I have a lot of compassion for people
[12:24] on all sides uh that are being hurt from
[12:28] this conflict and there are many
[12:31] atrocities that are being done at the
[12:33] moment in the name of this holy war um
[12:37] so it's very sad and it's very hard to
[12:40] be living in such a situation such a
[12:43] place yeah so yeah I'm sorry that that's
[12:47] the opening for my interview but this is
[12:49] real this is the reality I live in I
[12:52] think it's a great opening actually for
[12:54] a Bitcoin conversation because it shows
[12:57] for me the the feared problem I'm not
[13:01] 100% sure if if we can stop Wars with a
[13:03] Bitcoin standard but we can get into
[13:05] this a little later um what I hear a lot
[13:08] when we talk about wars and when we talk
[13:11] about uh uh things like that um why
[13:15] people do that or why is it causing or
[13:17] what's the real reason for for for war
[13:20] is for me like um when when there's a
[13:23] leader uh in a country uh and there is a
[13:27] war coming out uh the people
[13:29] I think are more likely to follow this
[13:33] leader in a in a catastrophic situation
[13:36] because they are fearful they they they
[13:38] want protection they want a strong
[13:39] leader and for me I'm I'm asking myself
[13:44] or like I'm asking you the question do
[13:46] you think the real purpose of a war is
[13:48] just to keep that feared uh system or
[13:51] that that bigger system alive because
[13:53] otherwise people will like ah when when
[13:56] you feel safe you you have a different
[13:58] kind of life you you ask different
[14:01] questions yeah see you're you're asking
[14:04] that uh to a person that lives in Israel
[14:08] and has a slightly different view than
[14:10] most people in Israel right I have a a
[14:14] different View and
[14:16] I I'm embracing that and I'm standing
[14:20] behind my view because of my experience
[14:22] in the Army uh I sa served in the Army
[14:26] 25 years ago and because of the role
[14:30] that I had and what I've done and what
[14:33] I've seen and so my view about um this
[14:39] specific war and many other wars in the
[14:43] history of Israel is that they are
[14:46] designed to keep people in a constant
[14:50] state of fear in a constant state of
[14:54] trauma it's like even more than fear
[14:57] it's trauma because with fear yeah you
[15:00] can get a lot down done but when you
[15:03] actually inflict trauma on a person you
[15:06] have a very significant shock time frame
[15:11] after you do a certain event and you may
[15:15] have heard about the movie or the book
[15:17] the shock Doctrine by Naomi Naomi wolf I
[15:21] think her name is um it's a it's a
[15:24] really stunning book and and movie which
[15:28] I recommend people to see if they have a
[15:30] strong stomach because it's a tough one
[15:32] but it basically shows you how the US
[15:36] has uh you know started different types
[15:40] of wars and and um coups in in different
[15:46] places around the world kudas right to
[15:49] take over the establishment in a certain
[15:52] country uh by a tactic of a shock
[15:56] Doctrine you come into the country and
[15:59] you create some kind of event or
[16:01] emergency or um a very
[16:06] shattering event that will create a
[16:09] shock with the society with the
[16:12] population in that country and during
[16:15] that shock period people will be so
[16:19] overwhelmed that they will not think
[16:22] straight and they will essentially be a
[16:24] lot more prone
[16:27] to almost anything that the
[16:29] establishment or the government wants to
[16:31] do in that country will be very hard for
[16:34] them to resist because almost anything
[16:36] that the government or the state would
[16:38] do at that stage would be portrayed as
[16:42] we're helping you or we're helping solve
[16:45] that problem that we now have and so
[16:48] when you create that cycle of problem
[16:51] reaction solution or that shock that
[16:54] will be followed by you know a soothing
[16:58] calming down period of the society and
[17:02] then introduction of a solution to solve
[17:05] that problem that just happened then you
[17:08] are um in a way like um Stockholm
[17:12] syndrome when you have a uh you know
[17:16] someone that goes into
[17:18] um uh someone that has been kidnapped
[17:21] and the kidnapper is then being
[17:22] portrayed by the good guy because he's
[17:24] now helping you so it's a little bit
[17:27] like that like the state is
[17:29] often times
[17:31] the factor that had started initiated or
[17:36] enabled that crisis to happen to begin
[17:40] with and then the people fall prey to
[17:43] that not seeing that the state has
[17:46] anything to do with that but thinking
[17:48] that oh it's just happened by some
[17:51] coincidence or you know bad intent or
[17:55] mal intent of someone from the outside
[17:58] or it has has nothing to do with our
[18:00] beloved you know government or state
[18:03] they would never do this to
[18:05] us and they will embrace the tightening
[18:09] control of the state over them in the
[18:13] guise of protecting them you know it's
[18:15] for your own safety it's for your own
[18:18] betterment we will we will be there we
[18:20] will take care of you in this tough time
[18:22] let us do what we're here to do and
[18:24] everyone will allow it to happen and so
[18:27] I was one of the first people to stand
[18:30] up on October 7th when the massacre
[18:34] happened in Israel uh a few hours later
[18:37] I recorded a video talking about what
[18:40] has just happened and what I'm thinking
[18:42] about it and it was that the Israeli
[18:45] government has actually allowed this to
[18:48] happen I mean the is the state the the
[18:51] the security forces the intelligence
[18:54] forces they've enabled this because
[18:58] there is no hands from my experience and
[19:00] my knowledge that something like this
[19:03] can happen in a natural
[19:06] way and you know I still may be wrong
[19:09] but all the proofs that have been
[19:11] gathered until today since then are
[19:14] showing us that I was probably right and
[19:16] they knew about it and they chose or
[19:20] chose not to act or just simply did not
[19:23] act I don't know the reason exactly why
[19:26] I have my speculations but uh it doesn't
[19:29] matter the the point is that if indeed
[19:34] in this case and in many other cases in
[19:36] Israel's history and in the history of
[19:39] humanity in the modern history of
[19:42] humanity this is the pattern that is
[19:45] happen again and again that a state or a
[19:47] government would allow horrible things
[19:50] to happen to their people because they
[19:54] have zero value to human lives in my
[19:56] opinion they care about many things but
[19:59] not about human lives then if this is
[20:01] the case and that's the pattern then
[20:04] history is full of such examples of
[20:08] where things will happen around the
[20:10] world we would think that they are
[20:12] happening with no connection
[20:14] to to our government or to the state or
[20:18] to the higher powers above that the
[20:20] global powers above that we would think
[20:22] that it's just a coincidence or a Mal
[20:24] inent where really these things are all
[20:26] planned and are happening because
[20:28] someone has an interest in starting Wars
[20:32] or
[20:33] starting tough periods where they want
[20:36] to clamp down on human rights and and
[20:39] create a different order or a different
[20:42] you know structure in the country and
[20:44] they need the cooperation of the people
[20:49] in order to bring this change about and
[20:52] the easiest way to create change is by
[20:57] enrolling the people into the reason of
[21:00] why we need that change and so when you
[21:02] do something like October 7th obviously
[21:06] most of the people of Israel would go
[21:10] yeah bring on the war they just
[21:12] massacred 1,400 people including
[21:15] children and everything in in in our
[21:18] country let's let's go in and wipe out
[21:22] Gaza you know that it becomes it becomes
[21:25] like a an okay things to say whereas if
[21:28] you said that a week earlier it would
[21:31] sound a little bit crazy like why would
[21:33] I go go out there and and wipe out an
[21:36] area of like two million people H how is
[21:39] that even possible right so that
[21:42] becomes a possibility that you can
[21:44] actually think about a week later
[21:47] because of what happened right so yeah
[21:51] so that's my view unpopular view
[21:54] but popular for me
[21:58] um that and and you also mentioned
[22:01] something very interesting that you said
[22:03] like 70% uh of the people the in this
[22:07] example that you gave were in favor or
[22:09] are in favor of of Another War uh which
[22:11] also makes me a question to the original
[22:15] question coming back to that question um
[22:18] do you think when we have a Bitcoin
[22:20] standard let's let's make this example
[22:21] of like there is no central banks um
[22:24] governments have to basically uh for
[22:28] everything the are doing they have to
[22:29] raise taxes uh they have to get uh
[22:32] people to to pay for for the government
[22:35] services so there's a completely
[22:37] different world when when you cannot uh
[22:39] just print money and we all use Bitcoin
[22:43] like in a utopian world would that um
[22:46] stop Wars or do you think uh they will
[22:50] just be different because people will
[22:52] still have those conflicts and it's
[22:54] human nature to to have those conflicts
[22:57] I think it will not stop s entirely
[22:59] first of all to to your um to the
[23:02] landscape that you're portraying where
[23:05] on a Bitcoin standard we may not have
[23:07] central banks then obviously I pray with
[23:11] you that one day the whole institution
[23:14] of Central Banking will be abolished
[23:16] however I'm not sure that that would
[23:19] happen because I think that
[23:22] maybe we are entering a stage
[23:26] where the governments or the States will
[23:30] understand the value of Bitcoin so well
[23:33] that they would be relatively quick to
[23:37] adopt Bitcoin as Treasury and the
[23:41] treasury will then have I mean the
[23:43] central bank will have some role with
[23:45] managing the treasury I think so maybe
[23:48] the the the roles and the functions of
[23:50] the central banks will change I don't
[23:52] know if they will be completely
[23:54] abolished um but we may with witness an
[23:59] era or an Epoch at which Central Banking
[24:02] is holding reserves and there is no more
[24:06] fractional Reserve but there is like
[24:08] full Reserve you know like they they
[24:10] lend the money out to the banks the
[24:12] commercial banks at a one to one ratio
[24:15] and not a fractional reserve and maybe
[24:16] that will solve some of the problems and
[24:18] so I think we are going to see a grad
[24:21] wherever it's going to play out however
[24:22] it's going to play out I'm not an
[24:24] economist I don't have like enough
[24:26] knowledge and experience to know or to
[24:28] speculate on how exactly this will play
[24:31] out but whatever way whichever way I
[24:34] think we will see a gradual period of
[24:38] change in which the power that the banks
[24:42] and the central banks hold will decrease
[24:48] slowly
[24:50] and while this change will take
[24:54] place we will see an era that
[24:58] good behavior or a positive impact on
[25:03] society will be
[25:05] incentivized where today it's not being
[25:08] incentivized so much even
[25:12] when there is an emphasis on doing good
[25:17] in the world like doing a PO putting a
[25:20] positive impact on the world in the
[25:23] corporate world today which is the world
[25:25] I come from it's called corporate
[25:27] responsibility you want corporations or
[25:30] companies to develop some kind of
[25:33] corporate responsibility and decide what
[25:36] topics or what areas they are taking
[25:38] upon themselves in order to bring a
[25:40] positive change in the world whether
[25:42] it's the environment or a social justice
[25:45] of some kind or a cause like they are
[25:48] incentivized in a way to to participate
[25:51] in this game but that game is completely
[25:54] flawed as well because the ones that are
[25:56] setting the rules for that game are the
[25:59] globalist powers of the world economic
[26:01] Forum or the UN dictated by the um uh
[26:05] sdgs this
[26:09] um forgot the S the the development
[26:12] goals of the UN sdg stands for S
[26:16] Development Goal I forget what the S
[26:19] stands for you can check it up on Google
[26:21] but
[26:22] um sustainable development goals that's
[26:25] it okay sustainable development goals so
[26:28] each each company or corporation that
[26:30] wants to participate in this game
[26:33] is taking part in adopting some of the
[26:37] sustainable development goals and
[26:38] deciding that now they are implementing
[26:40] like an ESG uh structure ESG stands for
[26:45] environmental social governance right so
[26:47] you're bringing in climate agenda
[26:49] climate is the Environmental part or
[26:52] lgbtq which is a social agenda into your
[26:55] company or corporation which may be a
[26:57] private company and you're not you don't
[26:59] have to do it because it's a private
[27:01] company you can do whatever the [ __ ] you
[27:02] want as a CEO of a private company but
[27:05] you take on that because there is an
[27:07] incentive structure because you are
[27:09] being told that if you don't Implement
[27:11] ESG in your company you may not receive
[27:15] funding from investors anymore investors
[27:18] want to invest in
[27:20] companies that develop a corporate
[27:23] responsibility that is backed by ESG and
[27:26] by sdgs and all these acronyms and so
[27:29] and this is like an indirect coercion
[27:32] mechanism that has a a really flawed
[27:36] incentive structure why do I say it's
[27:38] coercion because you will simply not get
[27:40] money from investors Fiat money if you
[27:43] don't um create those social
[27:48] and and climate related causes in your
[27:52] company you may not care about these
[27:54] topics at all and you just may want to
[27:56] focus on what your company supposed to
[27:58] do but you have an incentive to actually
[28:01] bring in those political and social
[28:05] causes into your company and so the
[28:07] incentive structure today to participate
[28:10] in doing good is completely flawed
[28:12] because it's forcing you to focus on
[28:14] specific agendas and it's forcing you to
[28:17] do so in order to continue to live to
[28:20] receive money from
[28:22] investors and so back to your question
[28:25] if we are going to live in an era where
[28:29] the in incentive structure is
[28:33] changing because you're
[28:36] not you're not
[28:38] um stimulated by a coercion that if you
[28:43] don't do this you will not get funding
[28:46] but
[28:47] rather you
[28:49] have a sound money and an honest money
[28:52] called Bitcoin that in order to receive
[28:55] it you have have to actually do the
[28:58] proof of work and prove that you're
[29:01] giving actual value for people and for
[29:04] society otherwise you won't get you
[29:08] won't you won't succeed and you won't
[29:09] get the revenues and the and the profit
[29:11] that you're supposed to make if you're
[29:13] not in that game of earning sound money
[29:18] good money that is not coerced by Fiat
[29:22] that can just be created and then
[29:23] there's abundance of it and investors
[29:25] can just have it and decide what to do
[29:28] with it and who to give it to based on
[29:30] all these
[29:32] arbitrary agendas or
[29:34] politics then there is a lot more
[29:38] fairness in the
[29:40] system in a in a very um inherent way
[29:44] like sort of the DNA of the system
[29:47] changes right because the money itself
[29:51] dictates the level of fairness the level
[29:55] of corruption the level of uh you know
[29:58] you know the level of manipulation that
[29:59] you can put in it's it's way harder to
[30:05] earn Bitcoin than it is to earn
[30:08] Fiat you can earn Fiat very easily by
[30:11] doing almost anything earning Bitcoin I
[30:15] think it's going to be a different bow
[30:16] game and again I know that I'm not I'm
[30:19] not a an expert or or a an economist or
[30:22] fin Financial expert to explain this
[30:26] from a financial point of
[30:29] view but I do know enough about
[30:32] marketing and
[30:33] creating demand and Supply in a market
[30:37] for a good
[30:38] product and really good and I've worked
[30:41] in many many product companies right
[30:44] tech companies product companies that
[30:45] have created some value proposition to
[30:48] the world and and recruited a lot of
[30:50] customers and so I know that if your
[30:54] product is not good enough or Not Ready
[30:56] or Not There are many many vectors many
[30:59] um um parameters that need to align in
[31:03] order for you to succeed in business and
[31:07] so with
[31:09] Bitcoin you have all of these stars that
[31:12] have to align plus you have money that
[31:17] is more
[31:18] scarce that is harder to achieve and
[31:21] that you actually have to prove that
[31:24] you're working and giving value in order
[31:27] to created unless you're a scammer and
[31:29] you're going to steal someone's
[31:32] Bitcoin um then then it's a lot more
[31:36] fair and so I think even if I don't know
[31:39] to to paint the picture exactly of how
[31:42] it's going to look like I have a an
[31:44] intuition that the real the new reality
[31:48] that we will live under in a Bitcoin
[31:50] standard will force Society to become
[31:55] more fair and more
[31:58] um and also more capitalistic in a way
[32:01] like that the Good Will Survive and that
[32:03] the good ones will the ones that
[32:05] actually bring value to society will
[32:08] shine and succeed and and do better in
[32:12] in life and so there will be less room
[32:15] for mediocracy and less room for bubbles
[32:18] to be
[32:19] created speculative bubbles to be
[32:22] created I hope so too and it's a when
[32:26] when we changed incent structure I think
[32:28] this could even happen way before we
[32:30] have a Bitcoin stand up because when
[32:32] when Bitcoin comes up and all those
[32:35] great Bitcoin is hold all those uh
[32:37] wealth and all those uh um investors
[32:41] like you said like you don't get uh
[32:43] investors money when you don't have the
[32:45] ESG rules but what if all those
[32:47] investors are bitcoiners because the
[32:49] wealth is now in Bitcoin this changes
[32:51] the game completely and all of the
[32:53] sudden even before we have Bitcoin as a
[32:55] med of exchange and unitive account this
[32:57] could already flip the uh incentive
[33:00] structure way earlier uh way before we
[33:03] have an a Bitcoin standard uh however
[33:06] this Bitcoin standard will look like so
[33:08] I feel like the the future uh is is very
[33:12] pride and I'm very hopeful that the next
[33:16] 50 years like from I'm now 25 till I'm
[33:19] 75 are uh a great great era in in in all
[33:24] our lives look that makes me really
[33:27] hopeful what you just said the fact that
[33:30] we are building an ecosystem of startups
[33:34] and investors and um Innovation
[33:37] entrepreneurship in Bitcoin that is
[33:40] based on that um basic principle of you
[33:46] know Liberty fairness uh
[33:49] um sound money it it really makes me
[33:52] hopeful because you know I've I've been
[33:54] interviewing like you a lot of amazing
[33:58] people that are in this space that are
[34:00] either entrepreneurs or investors and
[34:03] and I already see the differences uh
[34:07] between the Fiat world the startup scene
[34:10] in the Fiat world that I come from to
[34:13] the startup world of Bitcoin that I'm
[34:16] now being exposed to and it's not only
[34:19] that you know these people
[34:22] are are good and have good
[34:25] intentions and obviously we all have ego
[34:28] so you'll get like you know ego bursts
[34:32] here and there for from everyone but the
[34:35] fact that these people have made it
[34:38] their life's mission to make a change in
[34:42] the world through Bitcoin says a lot
[34:44] about them and says a lot about the way
[34:47] that they are and will be managing their
[34:51] portfolio of
[34:53] companies and their choice like their
[34:56] portfolio of companies for invest vors
[34:58] and their choice of investors for the
[35:00] startups and so it's like a game where
[35:04] the powers are changing and the people
[35:07] that are playing that game are
[35:09] changing and you know I've seen for so
[35:12] long for so many years I've seen so many
[35:15] entrepreneurs and CEOs of startups that
[35:19] are
[35:19] creating businesses and companies um
[35:24] based on nice ideas or
[35:28] you know sometimes sometimes even boring
[35:30] or bad ideas but they get the money they
[35:33] get the funding because the investors
[35:35] have it and the money has to trickle
[35:37] down the waterfall of you know Society
[35:42] of of the economy so so the money is
[35:45] just there so it's going everywhere and
[35:48] I was like you know this is just such a
[35:51] waste of money such a waste of people's
[35:54] time such a waste of
[35:56] energy and so many of these startups
[35:59] failed most of them failed and they
[36:02] don't succeed and they don't go anywhere
[36:04] and people experience heartache and you
[36:07] know crisises in their lives and
[36:08] breakdowns because of these failures
[36:11] because of the broken
[36:13] system and now I'm like seeing and I'm
[36:15] not saying that Bitcoin startups will
[36:17] not fail obviously some of them will
[36:19] fail as well this is life it's just uh
[36:22] it's like that there are many reasons
[36:23] for a startup or a business to fail so
[36:26] that will continue happening but if the
[36:29] threshold is becoming higher and I've
[36:32] heard um I think it was two days ago
[36:35] I've listened to the podcast um one of
[36:37] my favorites tftc um Marty bent is
[36:41] interviewing Preston pich two of my
[36:43] favorite
[36:44] people listening to them speaking about
[36:47] the threshold for CEOs of startups today
[36:51] which is about
[36:52] 55% that you have to show your investors
[36:55] that you are making um
[36:59] annually this is very very high like in
[37:01] traditional startups it's normally like
[37:03] 10 12% 15% tops and that's high so now
[37:08] for Bitcoin companies it's like 55%
[37:11] because not only that you have to like
[37:12] win the market with your product you you
[37:15] also have to like win um the Bitcoin
[37:19] yield which is very high much higher
[37:21] than Fiat yield so you have to rise up
[37:24] to like 55% return on investment for for
[37:27] for um investors and that is a very big
[37:32] ask that is a very big task so Bitcoin
[37:34] startups have to
[37:36] be much more efficient and much more
[37:40] productive and much more and much better
[37:42] at what they do than normal startups
[37:46] like on the Fiat standard right so
[37:49] there's a b much bigger challenge for
[37:51] them to overcome and so if we are
[37:54] building right now that kind of industry
[37:58] that the threshold is so high the
[38:00] challenge is so high and they are
[38:03] successful in it then dude we are
[38:06] building a kickass industry like we're
[38:09] building a kickass
[38:11] ecosystem just based on these numbers
[38:14] that is that is phenomenal if if we
[38:17] succeed in that and I hope we do and I
[38:21] and that's why I always say to people
[38:23] smart people good people like whether
[38:25] they're in sales or Market or product or
[38:29] technology you know development where
[38:32] whatever come into the Bitcoin space
[38:35] there is so much to do it is such a
[38:38] young ecosystem it's is such a young
[38:40] industry that needs all this talent and
[38:44] all the best and brightest in order to
[38:46] succeed it cannot be a mediocre company
[38:49] it will just not have any excuse to
[38:51] survive it will fail very quickly okay
[38:54] but if you are a very smart person
[38:56] bright sophisticated good at what you do
[38:59] even if you're in a niche you'll find
[39:02] your place in the Bitcoin industry it
[39:05] may be harder because there is not much
[39:06] money at the moment in um in Bitcoin
[39:10] startups there is not much if I compare
[39:13] that to the startups even to the crypto
[39:16] space right crypto companies get so much
[39:19] more funding than Bitcoin companies it's
[39:22] ridiculous because we both you and I
[39:25] know like who's going to build better
[39:27] product or the more you know the more
[39:30] valuable product but it's we're still
[39:33] early days and that and people still
[39:34] don't get it like the big money is still
[39:36] not getting it fully and so it takes
[39:39] more time for the big money to come into
[39:42] the tech ecosystem and the tech industry
[39:46] but it will happen and I think it's
[39:47] starting to happen and so that's why I
[39:50] tell like good friends around me that
[39:52] come from the tech
[39:53] industry start building your own startup
[39:56] or start thinking about integrating into
[39:58] an
[39:59] existing Bitcoin startup because you're
[40:02] going to do really well because this is
[40:04] going to be this is a game
[40:07] Cher um yeah so I'm very hopeful and I
[40:11] love the I love thinking about what the
[40:15] Bitcoin ecosystem Tech ecosystem would
[40:18] look like in the next few years not just
[40:21] life not just you know War and Peace but
[40:24] also Innovation and Entrepreneurship I
[40:26] think that will flourish under a Bitcoin
[40:30] standard if you watch or listen to my
[40:33] podcast on a regular basis I'll guess
[40:35] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[40:38] the most important step is to keep the
[40:41] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[40:43] wallet my personal recommendation for
[40:45] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[40:48] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[40:50] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[40:53] the Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[40:56] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[40:59] the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss

[41:06] really want to bulletproof your self-
[41:08] custody setup your security setup and
[41:10] maybe even your citizenship setup you
[41:14] have to talk to the Bitcoin way if you
[41:16] go to the Bitcoin way.com
[41:19] Partners robobin you get a 30 minute
[41:23] free call where you can dive deep with
[41:26] them if you're self- custody setup is
[41:28] secure if your citizenship is secure or
[41:32] maybe might be improvable or your
[41:34] digital footprint in general is secure
[41:37] they are the experts in cyber security
[41:40] in Bitcoin self- custody and how to be a
[41:43] secure sovereign individual in general
[41:46] and last but not least I have something
[41:49] completely new for you guys I partnered
[41:52] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[41:55] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[41:58] saw created by anyone look at that
[42:01] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[42:04] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[42:07] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[42:10] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[42:13] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[42:16] make sure to check out the link in the
[42:18] description for this amazing coin
[42:20] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[42:23] amazing I love them so much it was
[42:25] really hard for me to pick the one I
[42:27] want to have because there are a lot of
[42:29] great options I went with the new
[42:31] transparency Edition they're all limited
[42:35] so grab yours those will not be
[42:37] available for a long time but there will
[42:39] come new models and new amazing designs
[42:42] along the way yeah and it's uh it's so
[42:45] interesting for me because when when you
[42:46] think about someone who wants to invest
[42:49] in a Bitcoin only startup he has to be a
[42:52] Bitcoin like there's probably no way
[42:54] around that um And he as a bit coin and
[42:57] he hel holds probably a lot of his
[42:59] wealth in Bitcoin and Bitcoin itself is
[43:03] quite a a rising star so you have to
[43:06] have an incentive to bring on an extra
[43:09] headache because investing in a startup
[43:12] is not just like ah put my money there
[43:13] you you have to care for that startup a
[43:15] little bit most early investors startup
[43:18] investors are active and not just like
[43:22] yeah they're involved so this uh keeps
[43:25] up the hurdle rate extremely which also
[43:29] brings up the quality of those startups
[43:31] if a Bitcoin startup survives for a few
[43:34] years this says way more than when a
[43:36] crypto or Fiat startup survives for a
[43:39] few years because it's way harder to
[43:40] survive in the Bitcoin landscape which
[43:43] uh improves the overall quality and
[43:46] that's that's something uh amazing to to
[43:50] witness one question uh because you
[43:53] mentioned uh your podcast and I think
[43:55] that this is always like learning from
[43:57] other bitcoiners learning from other
[43:59] people in general is is such an a great
[44:02] honor to have and you already have so
[44:04] many great podcasts um what is uh what
[44:08] would you say is your biggest learning
[44:09] or your like the the one takeaway that
[44:12] you have now from this I don't know what
[44:14] was it 40 episodes something around that
[44:16] almost almost 40 episodes what was your
[44:19] like the the biggest takeaway uh that
[44:21] you had from that I had a thousand
[44:23] takeaways it's like almost after every
[44:25] episode my mind is like blowing with
[44:28] like damn you know how in The Matrix
[44:31] they plug it in they plug Neo in in
[44:34] order to to learn new things I know G
[44:38] Jitsu it's like that like when I finish
[44:41] when I finish an episode it's like damn
[44:43] I just learned all that stuff about
[44:46] whatever you know Investments
[44:49] or yeah so you know one of the I I'll
[44:54] just say a few because it's hard for me
[44:56] to pinpoint
[44:57] .1 big takeaway right so when I did the
[45:01] episode with uh Mark Moss I think I
[45:04] understood how you can be and this is
[45:07] like it's funny because it's not related
[45:09] to like money or Bitcoin but it's
[45:11] related to like life I I understood how
[45:14] you can be really successful
[45:17] entrepreneur and small business on your
[45:21] own and keep your modesty and being a
[45:26] real human being and I mean Mark for me
[45:29] is such a an inspiration an example of
[45:32] someone that is constantly like teaching
[45:36] people and giving them from his
[45:38] knowledge and his
[45:41] expertise
[45:43] um very generous and still stays with
[45:47] like both feet on the ground very very
[45:51] humble very like eye level like you can
[45:53] start a conversation with him and
[45:55] straight away feel like any question you
[45:58] would ask would be a good question or a
[46:01] right question to ask like you'd feel
[46:04] very at home with who you are around him
[46:09] and many of my guests had that trait
[46:12] Like Larry leard for example you speak
[46:14] to him like you ask a question he
[46:16] validates you straight away like you get
[46:18] the right like like you ask a question
[46:21] he goes right right I yeah I have the
[46:24] same question then he starts answering
[46:25] you so it's like when you speak to
[46:27] people that
[46:29] you find that they are so humble and
[46:35] good to you no matter what your level of
[46:38] understanding he is or no matter what
[46:40] where you come from what your background
[46:42] is where you're from who you are they're
[46:45] just simply kind welcome and and
[46:49] welcoming and and and nice you just
[46:53] realize that you
[46:55] know good and kindness exists in the
[46:58] world and not all successful people have
[47:01] to be you know this
[47:04] snobbish
[47:06] um really condescending Superior people
[47:10] and I think that that's one thing that
[47:12] really is important for me in life in
[47:14] general that people stay humble because
[47:18] I think that one of the
[47:20] core reasons
[47:22] for the hardship and the conflict and
[47:26] you know the suffering the pain and the
[47:28] wars that we see in the world is a
[47:30] superiority is the fact that we think
[47:32] that we are better than other people and
[47:34] that we are superior in one way or
[47:37] another and that we don't see the unity
[47:40] we don't see how we are all the same
[47:42] really yeah so one has more knowledge
[47:45] than another one has more expertise in
[47:47] something than another but in the end of
[47:49] the day we're all human beings we have
[47:51] the same characteristics we have the
[47:53] same DNA we have the same you know we
[47:55] have a lot of potential some of us
[47:58] discover that potential more than others
[48:00] but we are all humans and we can all
[48:03] benefit from each other if we learn how
[48:06] to be kinder and and be better to each
[48:09] other and to ourselves and in some in
[48:14] some
[48:15] surprising uh bizarre way I feel like
[48:18] the Bitcoin industry has a larger
[48:22] concentration
[48:23] of those characteristics than other
[48:26] groups in the society and so it makes me
[48:29] very happy and very hopeful and very um
[48:31] motivated to keep doing what I'm doing
[48:34] and to by then Inspire other people to
[48:37] do what they want to do as well because
[48:40] I show them that you can you know be
[48:44] smart and successful and um and maybe
[48:48] you know funny and wise and still keep a
[48:53] very open mind and kind heart an open
[48:57] heart and so Mark Moss was one that gave
[49:00] me that and Larry as I said Peter S and
[49:05] you know ever so many of my of my guests
[49:08] obviously Jeff
[49:10] Booth and even Michael Sor when you know
[49:13] you interviewed him as well and when I
[49:15] interviewed him like the first question
[49:18] I asked him he answered me in such a
[49:22] graceful manner with with an analogy
[49:26] straight away way but the way he
[49:28] answered just his energy and
[49:30] communication if you take a look at that
[49:32] at that episode you'll see that that's
[49:34] the first question I ask him and he
[49:36] answers in such a theatrical way as if
[49:39] he actually cares and invests in how he
[49:43] is delivering the message not just the
[49:46] message itself because you and I both
[49:49] know that Michael had been interviewed
[49:51] hundreds of times by hundreds of people
[49:55] and often times he is being asked the
[49:57] same questions again and again and again
[50:00] right because you know as much as we are
[50:03] talented we still come up with similar
[50:05] questions because we want to know
[50:07] similar things and the fact that he's
[50:10] able to kind of recruit himself again
[50:13] and again and again and bring out that
[50:17] enthusiasm and excitement and you know
[50:21] dynamism in the way that he answers that
[50:24] makes all the difference that it shows
[50:26] that he really cares it shows that he's
[50:28] really having fun and and that I don't
[50:31] take that for granted so you know I I
[50:34] think you know so I think in the end of
[50:37] in the end of this long speech I did
[50:39] give you just one thing which is like
[50:42] people's kindness in communication and
[50:46] people's gracefulness
[50:49] in being with another
[50:51] person that really teaches me more
[50:56] humbleness more
[50:57] modesty and gives me inspiration to be
[51:01] who I am and to continue giving to other
[51:04] people and this comes I I think Jeff
[51:06] boof said that that Bitcoin is an ego
[51:08] killer I think he also has L ego death
[51:10] Capital uh and it's it's it's such an
[51:13] amazing way to to look at it because you
[51:15] you get humbled along the way so many
[51:17] times or you try to find you fix Bitcoin
[51:20] you invest in some shitcoin and then all
[51:23] of the sudden oh that was that was not
[51:25] better than Bitcoin and there so many
[51:27] small Avenues where you go through and
[51:29] then oh yeah Bitcoin humbles me again so
[51:32] yeah it's it's it's great to have have
[51:34] those thing and I think also the Bitcoin
[51:35] Community itself like I came as a a
[51:38] stock Pro and crypto Pro into the
[51:41] Bitcoin Twitter uh real and Bitcoin
[51:44] Twitter Made Me Do Bitcoin Maxi like
[51:46] Twitter wow really Twitter humbled me I
[51:49] just got so much feedback from my tweets
[51:52] and you can look back like the last two
[51:54] two and a half like five years or
[51:56] something like that all my tweets are
[51:58] public I never deleted anything so you
[52:00] can actually look through my history of
[52:03] of getting from a stock Pro to a Bitcoin
[52:06] Maxi uh which is fascinating I also had
[52:09] some small shitcoin thing there but
[52:11] that's actually not that public on on on
[52:13] on Twitter because I kept it to myself
[52:15] for the most part because Bitcoin
[52:17] Twitter was like really pushing uh and
[52:20] yeah I'm not only Bitcoin itself but
[52:22] also Bitcoin Community I feel like is is
[52:24] very cool and and very uh um humbling uh
[52:28] to begin with um I have seen one thing
[52:31] in I always am curious what what people
[52:33] write in their own bios and how they
[52:35] describe their things and you have two
[52:37] things uh written in in in the bit in
[52:40] the bio that uh is not directly related
[52:43] to to to bitcoin and I want to ask you
[52:46] what are the connections there and and
[52:48] what's the importance for you there the
[52:50] first thing is Health you you you put
[52:53] the word Health in there what's the
[52:55] connection for you uh from Bitcoin and
[52:58] health and do you think like a sound
[52:59] monetary system is also then
[53:02] incentivizing a sound body sound spirit
[53:06] and a Sound Health in
[53:08] general right I don't remember the exact
[53:12] wording I Ed there on the bio related to
[53:14] health what did I write I think I think
[53:17] uh on your podcast link tree there's
[53:19] just like Health written like like money
[53:22] that's right okay now I get it it's
[53:24] written as one of my topics yeah so when
[53:26] I when I introduce my podcast I say my
[53:29] podcast is called You're the voice and
[53:32] it's not just a Bitcoin podcast it's a
[53:34] podcast about health and politics and
[53:37] the changes that the world is going
[53:39] through
[53:40] digitalization mind control Health you
[53:43] know climate I cover many many topics
[53:46] and obviously money and Bitcoin and I
[53:48] cover a lot more money and Bitcoin
[53:51] lately um since I I'm deeper into it but
[53:56] health is a super important topic for
[54:00] me first of all because I started my
[54:03] Awakening process spiritual and
[54:06] informative Awakening
[54:08] process uh during covid in 2020 I think
[54:13] 2020
[54:14] 2021 where I experienced personally
[54:20] um a very hard time because I chose not
[54:25] to participate in the genetic experiment
[54:28] that was running around the world and
[54:30] actually it was more than a genetic
[54:32] experiment it was a social experiment
[54:34] and a psychological experiment on on the
[54:36] world on the world society that people
[54:39] don't really understand and they still
[54:40] think that Co was a health event and it
[54:43] was not a health event in fact there was
[54:46] no pandemic if you look at the numbers
[54:48] and you are a critical thinker and
[54:50] you're you go and you check things
[54:53] rather than trusting an expert you go
[54:55] and you validate yourself
[54:56] and that's what I've done during Co I
[54:58] became like a health fanatic uh in a way
[55:02] because I I went to do my own research
[55:04] on health and to understand what is this
[55:07] Mayhem and why do they want me to do
[55:10] things to my body that I may not want to
[55:13] do not for myself and not for my son and
[55:16] I decided not to participate in this uh
[55:19] experiment and I this was the one of the
[55:22] best decisions of my life but not just
[55:26] because of a health perspective but
[55:28] because it helped me wake up to a lot of
[55:30] the lies I wouldn't be in Bitcoin if it
[55:33] wasn't for health right so my way my
[55:36] rabbit hole into Bitcoin started with Co
[55:39] started with health starting to see the
[55:42] broken incentive structure the way the
[55:45] doctors are behaving because of the
[55:47] incentive structures that they have
[55:49] towards the government towards the
[55:51] Ministry of Health towards the world
[55:52] Heth Health Organization like all this
[55:56] structure of politics that is built
[55:59] around our health that is trickling down
[56:02] and impacting our individual lives in
[56:05] such a sophisticated way and the thing
[56:09] that helped me wake up to it was my
[56:11] experiences being a marketeer just
[56:14] seeing the marketing campaign that
[56:16] started taking place during covid on how
[56:19] they are brainwashing people's minds
[56:21] into believing that first of all that
[56:24] there is the end of the world pandemic
[56:26] and then that the vaccinations are the
[56:29] best Solutions out of it right again the
[56:31] problem reaction solution and seeing a
[56:35] propaganda forming so that like I
[56:38] started investigating and so a lot of my
[56:42] early interviews on my podcast are
[56:45] related to health and are with doctors
[56:47] and researchers and and people that are
[56:50] heavily involved into the covid uh
[56:53] period and still are doing a lot in in
[56:56] order to experience uh sorry in order to
[56:59] um expose uh the lies of the covid uh
[57:04] era and at one point when the government
[57:07] and the state came so hard and violated
[57:11] my my bodily autonomy and my rights over
[57:16] my health and my body I then understood
[57:20] that the next thing they're going to do
[57:22] is to violate in the same way my
[57:25] property rights and my rights over my
[57:27] money and what's mine and so I decided
[57:30] to start learning about money and that's
[57:32] how I I didn't transition but I just
[57:35] added to my portfolio the topic of money
[57:38] and economies and um financials and
[57:42] Bitcoin um I mean Bitcoin was the
[57:45] solution that I found down down the
[57:47] track but I started with investigating
[57:49] money out of investigating health and so
[57:53] I continue to talk about health because
[57:56] I believe I mean my my big thing in my
[58:00] podcast is sovereignty and how to push
[58:03] people to discover sovereignty in their
[58:06] lives whether it would be in their
[58:09] health or in their financials or in
[58:12] their nutrition or in
[58:15] their uh environment with the climate
[58:18] and everything like just finding
[58:19] sovereignty everywhere so you can become
[58:22] a sovereign human being and reclaim the
[58:25] power that you have given away to
[58:27] different entities like reclaim that and
[58:30] take ownership and responsibility over
[58:32] your your life and so with health we
[58:35] have completely given away our
[58:40] decision-making processes and our um our
[58:44] judgment to other people whether it's
[58:47] doctors or the state to decide things
[58:50] for us and so I push people to reclaim
[58:53] their sovereignty over their health just
[58:55] the same way I push people to or not
[58:58] push encourage people to reclaim their
[59:00] sovereignty over their financials and
[59:03] and and be introduced into Bitcoin so
[59:06] yeah health is super important I am a
[59:09] big advocate for Natural Health and um I
[59:14] have completely stopped consuming any
[59:17] Pharma product since 2020 not even
[59:21] paracetamol not even Advil nothing like
[59:25] zero I started
[59:26] using uh e etheric um oils and natural
[59:32] oils and and mushrooms so both
[59:36] psilocybin mushrooms for micro dozing
[59:39] and um and mushrooms without psybin just
[59:44] as a nutritional um additive so
[59:48] different types of mushrooms that are
[59:50] just amazing for different things um
[59:53] vitamins vitamin C in its raw raw
[59:56] form uh vitamin D like so I'm I'm very
[60:00] much into Natural Health um and and it's
[60:04] not something that I do I just consume
[60:06] it I learn it I read a lot about it I
[60:09] treat myself and my family if they allow
[60:12] me or or my my son uh in this way and I
[60:16] think that that's amazing because um
[60:20] yeah I've you know just this is for your
[60:23] female listeners I don't know how many
[60:25] you have but for example birth control
[60:27] like that's something we're all
[60:29] conditioned to think that it's so normal
[60:31] and okay to just take and I've been I've
[60:34] been taking birth control pills for like
[60:37] 20 years and my body completely
[60:40] forgot the female cycle how to create
[60:44] that cycle the menstrual cycle on its
[60:47] own and so when I got off those pills my
[60:51] body was like all over the place it
[60:53] didn't know how to do it on its own
[60:55] because it was so relying on external
[60:57] hormones to do it for it so I had to
[61:00] work in like re-educating my body on how
[61:04] to create that menstrual
[61:07] cycle again so I did that using
[61:09] mushrooms and and I managed to to
[61:13] succeed but it's not easy to teach your
[61:16] body again to walk on its own like to
[61:19] reclaim that sovereignty so yeah so I
[61:23] think you know that's that's what I care
[61:25] about but I care about people um taking
[61:30] sovereignty back to their own hands
[61:32] whether it's health or financials or any
[61:35] other topic that's that's amazing it's
[61:37] also um I just looked it up uh because
[61:41] I'm curious like it's it's it's slowly
[61:42] slowly creeping up my female listeners
[61:45] quote I think it was like when I started
[61:47] like uh like I think the first time I
[61:50] looked at the statistics was like four
[61:52] months ago then it was like 3% or
[61:55] something like that
[61:56] that that was really low and now it's
[61:58] like seven 8% so it's slowly slowly
[62:02] getting better so you know Robin the
[62:04] more female guests you'll bring the more
[62:07] female audience you'll have because a
[62:09] lot of the a lot of M my my audience is
[62:13] almost 5050 it's like around yeah 40 40
[62:17] 60 I think just because I am a woman and
[62:21] because you know women can identify with
[62:23] women more easily just like men can
[62:25] identify with men more easily and so
[62:28] it's like a natural thing there is no
[62:30] magic in it and so I think that the more
[62:33] and since I talk a about a lot about
[62:35] like manly topics like money then I do
[62:39] have a lot of male
[62:41] audiences relatively speaking I believe
[62:44] that if I wouldn't speak about money I'd
[62:46] have a lot more females than males
[62:49] listening to my podcast but I think that
[62:51] now you know PE my audience will be
[62:53] exposed to your podcast when I share it
[62:56] and a lot of my female audiences will go
[62:59] okay I want to learn more about money I
[63:01] want to learn more about Bitcoin this
[63:03] guy is producing and for my female
[63:05] audience if you don't know Robin is
[63:06] producing like Mega quantities of
[63:11] content and interviews how many it's
[63:14] like one a day or what what is it yeah
[63:16] it's it's one a day and I'm I think 200
[63:19] 15 or 20 now yeah that there you go so
[63:23] it's like my my female audience would go
[63:25] okay if I want to go deeper this is a
[63:27] good source for me and so I I can
[63:30] definitely use Robin and so I think that
[63:33] the the the only thing we have to cross
[63:35] is the first hurdle when you um
[63:39] intuitively are drawn to someone because
[63:42] of their sex or because of their the way
[63:45] they look or because something else that
[63:47] draws you in their energy or whatever
[63:50] but once you're in and you cross that
[63:53] hurdle you discover that certain topic
[63:56] interests you or a certain person
[63:58] interests you or whatever I know so many
[64:01] of my audiences have been thanking me
[64:04] and like writing to me in in person to
[64:06] tell me thank you for introducing all
[64:09] these interesting people to them that
[64:12] they can then go and continue learning
[64:14] from later so that's like a to me this
[64:17] is an awesome contribution that I can
[64:20] then con help them continue their
[64:22] Journey their learning process with
[64:24] other people that's great because I
[64:26] don't have all the answers and I I'm not
[64:29] you know I I'm just like one source you
[64:32] want to when you want to learn you want
[64:34] to you want to do it from various people
[64:36] and so I think yeah it's great if you
[64:39] bring more women and I think in the
[64:41] Bitcoin space there are so many talented
[64:46] women that are not getting Center Stage
[64:51] but not because people don't want to
[64:53] invite them but because of the nature of
[64:58] women that they're a little bit more shy
[65:00] and they don't push themselves and so
[65:02] they may be less seen and they don't
[65:06] position themselves as experts in
[65:09] something there is a like an innate an
[65:12] innate like a natural sense of uh
[65:17] modesty it's not humbleness it's modesty
[65:21] in women because they often times don't
[65:25] think that they're
[65:26] Worth right it's like self-worth thing
[65:29] with women so they don't even imagine
[65:32] they it doesn't even cross their minds
[65:34] to write something in their bio that
[65:37] would make people approach them to ask
[65:40] them to be interviewed or come to speak
[65:41] at an event right they will just like
[65:44] write something that will be very vague
[65:47] or you know their tweets will be about
[65:50] things that are happening out there and
[65:52] not necessarily their own opinion or
[65:54] something that the they want to push so
[65:57] women are generally less good at
[65:59] promoting themselves I see men can can I
[66:02] can I share something funny with you
[66:04] about that please please you know when I
[66:06] interviewed
[66:08] sailor I thought that what would happen
[66:13] after this interview is that I'd get
[66:15] like shitloads of male followers that
[66:20] love sailor right and I did get a slight
[66:22] increase in follower base it it was nice
[66:25] like I get more followers especially on
[66:27] YouTube it was nice A lot of them
[66:29] criticized me whatever like male love to
[66:32] criticize they were like why is she
[66:34] nodding all the time or stop talking
[66:37] when he's you I hardly spoke at this
[66:40] interview I was so quiet whatever so I
[66:42] got a lot of criticism I got some male
[66:46] audiences new male
[66:48] audiences but the one thing I got the
[66:50] most was males guys approaching me to
[66:56] ask me to interview them after the
[66:59] Sailor interview and that was in a
[67:03] totally different proportion or ratio to
[67:07] what I have received before so I have
[67:10] the podcast even before and I was you
[67:11] know interviewing like really cool
[67:13] people like Samson and Jeff and you know
[67:16] and Eric KAS and whatever like a lot of
[67:18] good people but after sailor it's like
[67:20] all these guys lining up knocking on my
[67:23] door can you interview me as well can
[67:25] can you interview me as well can you
[67:26] interview me as well it's like almost
[67:28] every day and I'm like what happened
[67:30] guys like you saw that I interviewed
[67:32] sailor and now I'm like interesting
[67:34] enough to interview you like you want to
[67:37] be on the same platform where sailor was
[67:40] what is it and the funny thing was which
[67:43] is which is legitimate it's fine it's
[67:45] good that they're doing it but not even
[67:47] one woman approached me to ask the same
[67:51] thing they could have I know many women
[67:54] in this space they did not approach me
[67:57] only the guys approached me why are they
[68:00] shy are do they not think that they're
[68:02] worthy do they not want to promote
[68:04] themselves what is it so you know it's
[68:07] an interesting statistic I think to to
[68:10] realize how much more uh courage and
[68:14] confidence Men have to go out there and
[68:18] put themselves out there and say hey I'm
[68:20] interesting enough can you put my voice
[68:22] out there I want my voice to be out
[68:24] there but we would not do it not in the
[68:27] same proportion so yeah so I encourage
[68:30] all women to approach all podcasters and
[68:33] tell them that you want to be
[68:35] interviewed it's fine you can do
[68:37] it that's so interesting I never looked
[68:39] at that but I can 100% uh confirm that
[68:43] because um I'm uh I'm taking often uh
[68:48] people on that have no following at all
[68:51] uh like I have uh even I had one guy on
[68:54] he just wrote me a lot of really
[68:56] interesting YouTube comments like really
[68:58] that long and I just like invited him
[69:01] and and then he was on the podcast
[69:03] because I found his replies were really
[69:05] meaningful and deep and long and really
[69:07] cool so I have a lot of um let's call it
[69:11] no names like not popular names on my
[69:14] show so now it gets more and more known
[69:18] that I do that and now I get a lot of uh
[69:21] people that have not no following at all
[69:25] that dite me randomly hey can I I have
[69:28] this amazing story can I be interviewed
[69:29] like I get this almost on a daily basis
[69:32] now I get on on a weekly basis I would
[69:34] say and I never realized there was not
[69:37] one woman doing that and I get it so
[69:40] often there you go and and obviously
[69:43] after sailor the the rate was increased
[69:45] of that I can also attach to that um but
[69:50] yeah it's it's like it's funny like a
[69:52] man can can say like oh sailor was
[69:54] interviewed on that I have no following
[69:56] I did not write a book I did not write
[69:58] an single article on bitcoin like
[70:00] there's people out there that have not
[70:01] written one single piece of on bitcoin
[70:05] and and then like hey I I saw a sale
[70:08] interview I also want to be interviewed
[70:11] and it's fine for me like I for example
[70:14] one guy approached me and it will be
[70:15] published soon and I he said like hey
[70:18] I'm this teacher I want to share this
[70:19] story and I was like really cool I would
[70:23] like to do it but I need to have some
[70:25] something and then he went on I created
[70:27] a YouTube channel and made a YouTube
[70:30] video over one hour long talking about
[70:33] Bitcoin and I watched the video and I
[70:35] was like oh that's really good like he
[70:36] he just created full application for my
[70:40] podcast that's amazing that's amazing
[70:43] yeah so but yeah I can totally attach to
[70:45] that like not one like every single uh
[70:49] woman that was on my show I approached
[70:53] and uh around probably 10 to 20% of the
[70:57] men that are on my show approach me like
[70:59] this is I think not a lot of people know
[71:01] that exactly even bigger ones like even
[71:04] with like 30 40,000 followers they're
[71:07] like hey I have a new book do you want
[71:08] to interview
[71:10] me exactly I get that from male females
[71:13] don't do that exactly so that's and and
[71:15] you know I've been teaching for the past
[71:18] nine years I've been teaching people
[71:21] personal branding how to build their own
[71:24] brand and I still do it today I do it
[71:27] mostly to organizations that invite me
[71:30] to teach their employees or their
[71:33] management or whatever and the first
[71:35] thing I say when I start teaching them
[71:38] is drop your humbleness or shyness or
[71:43] modesty it is not the time for it I mean
[71:47] it's okay that you continue to be humble
[71:50] in your life but when you want to build
[71:51] a brand when you want to be known for
[71:54] something when you want people to
[71:56] approach you with suggestions with
[71:59] opportunities with business
[72:00] opportunities with personal
[72:03] opportunities how the [ __ ] would people
[72:05] know what you want in life if you don't
[72:09] put yourself out there they are not
[72:11] reading your mind they are not in your
[72:14] head they do not know what your life
[72:16] looks like we are so self-centered that
[72:19] we think that the world knows stuff
[72:22] about us people know nothing people are
[72:24] so so egocentric they just care about
[72:27] themselves and they focus on themselves
[72:29] and they don't really bother to get
[72:32] interested in other people's lives
[72:34] unless it's really close friends or
[72:36] family so most people don't know if you
[72:38] want them to know something about you if
[72:41] you want to promote something if you
[72:42] want to get a new job offer if you want
[72:45] a new project if you want a
[72:46] collaboration if you want your if you
[72:49] want more followers you want more people
[72:51] to know who you are and what you do you
[72:53] have to do work the work is to First
[72:58] build your identity as a brand your your
[73:01] brand identity and then to start
[73:05] creating content and put it out there if
[73:07] you don't put it out there no one will
[73:09] know and the way to put it out there is
[73:13] diverse there are so many ways that you
[73:14] can do that and one of the ways is yeah
[73:17] go on podcasts you know write a book
[73:19] write an article there's so many things
[73:22] you can do today this is like endless do
[73:24] a little me heat up whatever but start
[73:27] building yourself and if you don't do
[73:29] the work no one will know and then
[73:30] you'll sit there and you'll go why this
[73:33] thing that I want to achieve in life why
[73:35] is this not happening like why isn't the
[73:38] world bringing me what I want to have
[73:40] happened you have to take action you
[73:42] have to be active about it you have to
[73:44] start putting yourself out there there
[73:46] is no room for modesty when you want to
[73:49] promote your brand
[73:52] so women wake up
[73:55] and and it's so um it it it's not it's
[74:00] not easy I would say but there there's
[74:03] like a clear pathway and you just have
[74:04] to do the work for that and it's really
[74:07] also like just saying yes to all
[74:09] opportunities like I was uh I get also a
[74:12] little bit more invited now to other
[74:13] podcast I never asked another podcast to
[74:16] be on on a show uh because uh uh yeah
[74:20] never crossed my mind that I actually do
[74:22] that uh but I have been on some
[74:25] podcasters who approach me but those
[74:26] podcasters are very small like some like
[74:30] some actually like I think three of them
[74:31] started their podcast with me like I was
[74:34] their first episode um and I have this
[74:37] thing where I just say yes to everything
[74:39] like I just like say yes to
[74:41] Opportunities uh even though in the end
[74:44] of the day it might turn out to be a
[74:46] waste of time but I think there is no
[74:48] such a thing of was like it's just like
[74:50] oh yeah I spent their time but I could
[74:52] have invested other things but maybe
[74:54] that would would have led to something
[74:56] way bigger led to something amazing so
[74:58] like I just try to say yes to almost
[75:02] everything uh that that I can do which
[75:06] also now filling up my calendar quite a
[75:09] lot but but that's that's a luxury
[75:11] problem to have um and just like saying
[75:14] yes to Opportunities and I say that
[75:17] because um when I approach women to be
[75:20] on my podcast I get way more often asked
[75:22] like oh why me
[75:25] I I think not as seriously yeah like
[75:30] like why because I approach people also
[75:33] that have not a big following so like
[75:35] people that have a big following don't
[75:37] question why you want me on a on a
[75:39] podcast like because they have been on
[75:41] so many other podcasts it's natural but
[75:44] but I have uh people on the podcast
[75:46] there it's like your their first podcast
[75:48] or second podcast or the fifth podcast
[75:51] uh and and then they see like oh they
[75:53] what see my channel and like the first
[75:54] thing that pops up with sailor and then
[75:56] they see like Jeff Po and 10,000 views
[75:58] and 30,000 views and 50 saor has like
[76:01] 150 or something like thousand views and
[76:03] then they intimidated and they're like
[76:05] oh why me like Why am the chosen one and
[76:09] I'm like yeah because you wrote that one
[76:11] article that I saw and it was really
[76:13] interesting or you you made that one
[76:15] appearance there and I thought it was
[76:16] really interesting and I just wanted to
[76:18] talk with you and I want to record that
[76:21] like why like that's pretty obvious why
[76:24] so but I get that uh I don't know
[76:27] there's probably like one two guys that
[76:29] also said why me but it's it's very like
[76:33] women it's mostly women yeah and that's
[76:35] that's a yeah now think this we're
[76:37] talking about podcasts now take it one
[76:39] step further and think about public
[76:41] speaking that's even harder right
[76:45] podcasting is even easier when you when
[76:47] you say to a woman go stand on a stage
[76:51] and speak or be on a panel or approach
[76:55] this event organizer and Pitch yourself
[76:58] to speak about something or they would
[77:00] go like what you're crazy like me what
[77:03] do I know who am I blah blah blah and
[77:05] the men would just go bring it
[77:09] on yes where do I sign up most men
[77:13] obviously we're generalizing but yeah
[77:15] it's like convincing women to pitch
[77:18] themselves to speak at events is hard
[77:22] they are very
[77:23] scared yeah I think
[77:25] I have 100% that that M like just for
[77:29] example if if a Bitcoin conference ask
[77:31] me to hey can you be tomorrow at the
[77:33] stage for like 2,000 people and I'm like
[77:36] H yes have no clue what I'm talking
[77:38] about but you ask me and I will do it
[77:41] because it's a massive opportunity I
[77:43] will just not sleep till tomorrow figure
[77:45] out what I'm talking about put some
[77:47] slides on there and then will do my best
[77:49] job
[77:50] possible uh yeah but I think uh when it
[77:53] comes to stage also like like more more
[77:55] males will be more frightened but I
[77:58] think yeah it's a general thing uh where
[78:00] where I see it also in in in the podcast
[78:03] and often times women wait to be invited
[78:06] uh instead of taking the initiative and
[78:09] pitching themselves so yeah and and I
[78:13] understand that as a like it's a natural
[78:15] thing but you as I said it's like you
[78:18] need to go one step back and think about
[78:21] your goals your business goals your
[78:23] personal goals your goals in life where
[78:25] do you want to reach and if a certain
[78:29] platform will promote that goal for you
[78:33] then you have to you have to take it you
[78:35] have to do things you have to take
[78:36] action and being on a stage being in a
[78:40] podcast writing something I don't know
[78:43] collaborating with someone these are the
[78:45] ways to do it so you gota women have to
[78:48] start thinking more in that very goal
[78:50] oriented way in order
[78:53] to progress in life and yeah I just
[78:58] realized that we already recording for
[79:00] almost one hour 20 minutes oh my God
[79:03] like this was like really quickly I had
[79:06] one Topic in my mind that I really
[79:08] wanted to cover but I think we we'll
[79:10] leave it for
[79:11] maybe another time because cbdcs is also
[79:14] really interesting and you made an
[79:16] presentation about that uh but we
[79:19] already had so many interesting topics
[79:21] and we have Anda with with two questions
[79:24] the one question is always the same
[79:25] question for every guest um what can we
[79:28] learn from you besides all the things
[79:30] that we already talked about in the
[79:32] episode
[79:33] spirituality so I am yeah I I
[79:39] love I love
[79:42] um understanding the
[79:45] human from other
[79:48] angles um my
[79:51] natural draw to marketing was because of
[79:56] the understanding of the human psyche
[79:58] and the way we think and the way we make
[80:04] decisions and in marketing I had this
[80:08] amazing combination of psychology and
[80:12] consumerism and business and it's like
[80:15] in that Crossroad of so many um so many
[80:19] topics like interdisciplinary
[80:21] area
[80:23] and one of the things that I started
[80:27] being exposed to learning more
[80:30] practicing training in my life in my
[80:33] daily life since like since I think 10
[80:37] years ago but it was very very slow in
[80:39] the first six years and the last four
[80:41] years it was accelerating is my
[80:44] spiritual um path and my Spiritual
[80:47] Awakening and
[80:49] by exposing myself more to spiritual
[80:53] teachers and trainers and mentors and
[80:57] and books and various ways I have
[81:01] another I have another angle or another
[81:03] lens to look at the human to look at
[81:06] myself to understand myself better and
[81:10] um I'm not a religious person I respect
[81:14] religions I respect people who who have
[81:17] faith and religion I think that faith is
[81:21] is an amazing thing because you actually
[81:24] get to expand your senses more than the
[81:28] five senses that we know you actually
[81:30] learn to trust in something or put your
[81:33] trust in something that you cannot see
[81:35] or hear or feel actually you can feel
[81:38] that's the only thing you can you can
[81:40] feel it because it's energy and so when
[81:42] you start developing trust in yourself
[81:45] or in a higher self or in a higher
[81:48] source and you start connecting back to
[81:53] who you are there is a whole world that
[81:56] opens up and you then understand that
[81:59] our that I'll speak for myself my goal
[82:03] in life my purpose is to clean and clear
[82:07] as much as as as I can of my [ __ ] that
[82:11] is out there my dialogues my limiting
[82:14] beliefs Etc and reconnect back to my
[82:19] very um
[82:22] Primal gift signature
[82:25] uh Essence purpose who I am why I came
[82:28] here what I came here to do what are my
[82:31] traits my uniqueness that I can
[82:34] reconnect to as a child we have that
[82:38] very naturally like children you see
[82:40] children they're like these bubbly
[82:43] creatures that is very easy to determine
[82:47] what they're all about what their strong
[82:51] strong suits are their characteristics
[82:53] the things that you you know that stand
[82:55] out their signature what is their
[82:57] signature because they're so connected
[82:58] to themselves there's no [ __ ] you
[83:00] know there's no there are no layers of
[83:02] complication of um trauma and and
[83:06] conditioning that have been created
[83:08] through the years for them they're very
[83:10] clean and so from round about like the
[83:13] age of seven to 14 this starts changing
[83:16] and then from 14 onwards it starts
[83:19] changing even more and we start
[83:21] accumulating all these um all these
[83:25] behavioral conditioning and and these
[83:28] meanings and interpretations that we
[83:30] give to life and to ourselves and we
[83:33] start a process of distancing ourselves
[83:37] from ourselves we're like separating the
[83:40] self from from life and so I'm in the
[83:44] inverse process now of like reconnecting
[83:47] back and coming closer in touch with
[83:50] myself and reconnecting to that child
[83:53] and understanding again my signature and
[83:56] who I am and uniqueness and I'm not
[83:58] trying to invent anything new I'm simply
[84:02] deciphering it's like in crypto right in
[84:05] cryptography I'm like deciphering my
[84:07] code again like reverse engineering back
[84:10] to the source to who I am to my
[84:12] signature and so spirituality really
[84:14] helps me in that and so in my podcast as
[84:17] well I interview some people uh that are
[84:21] on the spiritual path and I also go on a
[84:24] lot of
[84:24] uh podcasts that are about
[84:28] spirituality and um and I love talking
[84:30] about that I love like investigating
[84:33] that and it really helps me um do the
[84:37] work and and keep like a good mental
[84:42] stability and spiritual stability and um
[84:46] and res and create resilience in my life
[84:48] so yeah so I that's spirituality is is
[84:52] an aspect that most people are not
[84:53] familiar
[84:55] with I I love that question uh so much
[84:58] that I now give it every end of the
[85:01] podcast because it gives just something
[85:02] completely new and the reason why I
[85:04] asked that question always is um because
[85:07] we mostly talk about Bitcoin I mean we
[85:09] talked about uh Wars we talked about
[85:12] female versus male things we talked
[85:14] about social media also like a lot of
[85:16] different topics but it gives the stage
[85:19] to learning something different from
[85:21] bitcoiners and I think bitcoiners are
[85:23] such unique people that we can learn way
[85:25] more than just money from each other
[85:28] 100% And my my next episode is going to
[85:31] be all about Spiritual Awakening so the
[85:34] people that are interested in that topic
[85:37] yeah jump over and take a look it's
[85:39] going to be it's for dummies it's like
[85:42] Awakening for
[85:44] dummies I I love that a lot I will
[85:47] definitely check it out um perfect then
[85:50] let's come to the end routine where the
[85:52] previous guest is asking a question for
[85:54] the next guest without knowing who the
[85:55] next guest actually is and yours is an
[85:59] really really interesting one uh who who
[86:01] was the last guest the last guest was
[86:04] Scott uh si si okay he uh is said six
[86:09] years and he writes kids books and makes
[86:12] the shamur I don't know maybe you heard
[86:13] about
[86:14] shamur the the games where you play like
[86:18] a memory game for kids but like in a
[86:21] Bitcoin way it's it's really it's really
[86:23] cool and really nice
[86:25] that game yeah
[86:27] and suiting to that uh theme of his and
[86:31] him the question from him is if you
[86:34] could teach a kid one thing about
[86:36] Bitcoin what would it be I actually just
[86:38] did that two days ago with my niece and
[86:43] the first thing I taught her is
[86:47] inflation I taught her how money Works
[86:52] how how Fiat system works and she got it
[86:55] straight away she understood so that's
[86:58] the one thing I would teach kids I would
[87:00] teach them how money is being created
[87:03] because then they get Bitcoin really
[87:04] quickly this is also interesting because
[87:06] people ask me and and it's funny how
[87:08] this connects because people ask me oh
[87:10] how do you orange build and I'm like I
[87:12] asked first before I start any
[87:15] questioning I asked first like oh what
[87:17] do you think about
[87:19] inflation because depending on what the
[87:21] answer to that question is I know where
[87:23] to start and if he's like oh yeah
[87:25] inflation is is good it's we need uh
[87:27] inflation but it should not be too high
[87:29] then I know oh I have to start way
[87:31] before
[87:32] Bitcoin and the first like five hours is
[87:35] not about Bitcoin it's about the
[87:36] financial system so inflation is the the
[87:40] start I love that that point yeah
