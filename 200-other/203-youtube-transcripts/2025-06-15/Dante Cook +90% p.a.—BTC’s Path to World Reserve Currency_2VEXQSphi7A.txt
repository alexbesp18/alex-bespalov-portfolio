[00:00] I believe Bitcoin will be the reserve
[00:01] currency of the world that if you hold
[00:03] Bitcoin for any 4year period you have a
[00:06] 96.6% chance of a positive return if you
[00:09] hold it for 1 year your probability of
[00:11] positive return is 70.3% with the
[00:14] average return being 90% AI I believe
[00:16] could be the only thing that potentially
[00:19] kicks the can down the road of the
[00:21] dollar Fiat collapse for another 10 to
[00:23] 20 years as we move to the digital
[00:25] transformation of money and the exchange
[00:27] of value in a global World there is one
[00:30] asset class that does it better than
[00:31] others that happens to be Bitcoin you
[00:33] can be apathetic and yeah this is how
[00:35] the world's going to continue to go and
[00:36] you can also shake your fist buy Bitcoin
[00:38] and put it in self- custody the dollar
[00:40] becomes so big we have to protect the
[00:42] dollar in so many places that we just
[00:45] Gorge ourselves on dollars until we
[00:47] become a 500 lb person on the couch that
[00:49] can't move and that's what ends up
[00:50] killing us gold won't be the winner at
[00:52] the end of that Bitcoin will be the
[00:54] winner I'm really hopeful for this Level
[00:56] Playing Field this new economic
[00:58] Constitution being instituted by big
[01:00] coin where we all have the same rules
[01:02] that we play on it's the same playing
[01:03] field we have one referee and that is
[01:05] the Bitcoin protocol so when these
[01:07] resets happen we reset as a human race
[01:10] back down that triangle of our needs and
[01:12] what that does is it levels the playing
[01:14] field it removes the excess of all of
[01:17] the things that we don't need and that
[01:19] allows us to reset on a new standard
[01:21] when that new standard is Bitcoin we
[01:23] then begin to trade onto this
[01:25] foundational layer based upon our Merit
[01:27] and not upon our debt it's the great
[01:29] debt Jubilee it happens either we
[01:31] willingly choose this or it happens via
[01:36] War I want to talk about before we get
[01:39] into Bitcoin and all all the interesting
[01:41] stuff I want to talk with you about your
[01:44] journey from Swan to now simply Bitcoin
[01:47] but maybe also where you're coming from
[01:49] what's your background uh how did you
[01:51] get to Swan and uh how did you then get
[01:54] off of Swan and what what did you learn
[01:56] from that Journey yeah that's great um
[01:58] I'm happy to share about that and I
[02:00] recently saw you know a tweet from you
[02:03] about how you're kind of doing this now
[02:04] full-time and I think that's kind of the
[02:07] goal and the trajectory for me as well
[02:09] so let me just uh give a broad
[02:12] background of just me and who I am and
[02:15] uh my sort of experiences because I
[02:17] think it really shapes my worldview um
[02:20] my parents as uh I mentioned before um
[02:23] they were not college educated they
[02:26] joined the military when they were 17
[02:28] and 18 years old I was actually born in
[02:31] Germany during the Gulf War um in
[02:34] Frankfurt Germany and um so my my Early
[02:38] Childhood started off International and
[02:40] then we came back to the United States
[02:42] and then they worked uh bluecollar jobs
[02:44] they worked at the post office and um
[02:47] you know from there I was a pretty good
[02:50] athlete um and uh I I had this ability
[02:53] to learn and so I ended up going to this
[02:56] school called William and Mary which is
[02:58] the second oldest university to Harvard
[03:00] University um and there's a lot of
[03:04] really smart people there and I I wasn't
[03:06] one of them I I learned pretty quick um
[03:08] I could run fast uh hit people do that
[03:11] sort of thing on the football field um
[03:14] but these people were really bright and
[03:15] they really expanded the idea that I had
[03:18] around education and academics and so I
[03:21] learned to learn I got three degrees at
[03:23] way and Mary I completed one in
[03:25] marketing one in finance and then one in
[03:27] Process Management and Consulting and
[03:30] then I really had this passion for
[03:32] entrepreneurship one of the guys that I
[03:33] met there uh was a really gifted
[03:36] entrepreneur he was one of the creators
[03:38] of the Norton anti virus a former NASA
[03:40] scientist he created the first mobile
[03:42] app company called app Forge he sold the
[03:45] Oracle in 2007 I think he sold too early
[03:49] um but he said Dante while you're here
[03:50] like don't take any electives and then
[03:52] like really think about getting into
[03:54] something on the ground floor and so I
[03:56] just came out to Indiana with a bad knee
[04:00] my Honda Accord with 280,000 miles on it
[04:03] God bless Betsy she still has uh 320,000
[04:06] miles on her and she's still driving
[04:08] every day uh those 03 Accords they just
[04:12] don't make them like that anymore um and
[04:15] I came out to Indiana with a bad knee
[04:17] thinking I might play football and there
[04:18] was this guy who said you could work for
[04:21] me while you figure out what you want to
[04:22] do with your life and um he sold his
[04:24] company to Salesforce for $2.3 billion
[04:27] after taking them public and that's how
[04:30] I got started in the entrepreneurship
[04:32] game and so then I've been on the ground
[04:34] floor of startups for 11 years um
[04:37] venture-backed private Equity backed
[04:39] startups from co-founding one of my own
[04:41] to being an early employee and so I've
[04:44] been able to do everything there is
[04:46] Under the Sun at an early stage company
[04:48] from sales to growth to product to you
[04:51] name it fundraising and so I joined Swan
[04:55] uh pretty early on I was one of the I
[04:57] think I don't know the number four
[04:58] member of the Swan private team uh where
[05:01] I was working with high net worth
[05:04] individuals um privately to help them
[05:06] navigate their their journey and in
[05:08] buying holding and securing Bitcoin and
[05:11] then this opportunity came when we were
[05:13] at Swan we saw all of these businesses
[05:16] that were creating Swan accounts and uh
[05:18] there was no one really leading the swan
[05:20] business team even though we had the
[05:21] ability to onboard businesses and so
[05:24] that was kind of my last role in
[05:25] assignment for the last 18 months at
[05:27] Swan uh which was on boarding businesses
[05:30] and companies uh onto Bitcoin and so we
[05:33] have you know Swan we had a few thousand
[05:36] companies that had Bitcoin on their
[05:37] balance sheet um you hear about the big
[05:39] names like metap planet or micro
[05:41] strategy or similar scientific but
[05:43] there's lots of plumbers single member
[05:46] llc's people that hold you know Bitcoin
[05:49] in um a retirement account you know U an
[05:53] entity that's non- taxable um with real
[05:56] estate and other things and so I worked
[05:58] with a lot of these people to help them
[05:59] na navigate that and January 11th it was
[06:03] like hey let's start creating some
[06:04] content to be irrelevant around
[06:06] ETFs and um I just started to want to
[06:10] you know be me and have some fun with it
[06:13] uh with some of those videos and they
[06:14] kind of took off and so that was like my
[06:16] journey at Swan and so here here I'll
[06:20] give you this Robin the biggest Insight
[06:21] that I had at Swan was when I was doing
[06:24] The Daily Show and I would put out this
[06:26] email of hey send me an email uh with
[06:30] any questions you have about Bitcoin
[06:32] email daily Swan bitcoin.com and when I
[06:36] was doing that I was getting 30 to 40
[06:37] emails a day it was
[06:39] crazy um and so it was just so
[06:42] surprising to me that people would open
[06:44] up share their life
[06:46] story you know everything that was going
[06:48] on I'm like whoa opsc like you're you're
[06:50] giving away way too much information
[06:52] here but it was interesting to see that
[06:54] people had these needs some of them
[06:56] people buying their first Bitcoin ever
[06:58] to people who were really far down the
[07:00] rabbit hole maybe 10 figure net worth
[07:03] but didn't have a place where they felt
[07:05] like they could share and get real
[07:07] expertise and advice and so that's my
[07:10] thing with Columbus right now um I'm I
[07:13] have this community where people can
[07:14] connect and C collaborate and it's an
[07:16] online digital Community a third space
[07:18] between LinkedIn and Twitter and I'm
[07:20] creating videos again with the simply
[07:22] Bitcoin team which is awesome my show is
[07:24] called Bitcoin simply so hopefully that
[07:27] gives a breakdown of what I've been
[07:28] doing
[07:30] uh my journey to and through Swan and
[07:32] what I'm doing now really really cool I
[07:34] love that Al that there's so many
[07:36] questions I I get that a lot also with
[07:38] with the newb coming in um but as we
[07:42] discussed the first time we you coming
[07:44] on my show it was right at that time uh
[07:47] and you were not sure if you stay in
[07:49] Bitcoin as a remember um why did you
[07:52] ultimately decided to actually stay in
[07:54] Bitcoin and and commit to to the Bitcoin
[07:57] Community wow one it was um I think it
[08:02] was really just the outpouring of the
[08:03] community I think after making The Daily
[08:06] Show it just surprised me um how many
[08:09] people would reach out to me they'd find
[08:12] my email or they'd comment on YouTube
[08:14] posts from all around the world of like
[08:16] hey we miss you we miss what you're
[08:17] doing so that was a big piece of it as
[08:19] well but then when I think really long
[08:22] term about the Dynamics of
[08:24] Bitcoin and I think the shift that we're
[08:26] going into you know this digital
[08:28] transformation of money as Michael
[08:30] sailor calls it um I really think that
[08:33] this is an incredible platform to be in
[08:35] long term and it has so many
[08:37] implications with so many unrealized
[08:40] opportunities that can Branch off from
[08:42] Bitcoin moving forward one of my you
[08:44] know one of these great books that I
[08:46] love I have this bookshelf behind me
[08:48] everyone always looks at the books that
[08:49] I have here but it's the everything
[08:51] store by Brad Stone about Jeff Bezos and
[08:54] he goes to his boss at the time at De
[08:57] Shaw and uh when he was there cuz he was
[08:59] one of their best employees one of their
[09:01] best Traders and he goes to his boss and
[09:03] he goes hey boss I'm leaving he's like
[09:05] what are you doing he's like I'm going
[09:07] to sell books he's like why would you
[09:09] ever do that that's the dumbest idea
[09:11] I've ever heard he's like well there's
[09:13] this thing called the internet and I
[09:15] looked at the compound annual growth
[09:17] rates from the past three years and it's
[09:19] over
[09:20] 2,000% so I don't know like what's going
[09:23] on but I feel like this is a good place
[09:25] to be and I feel like books is a good
[09:27] place to start and so started with books
[09:30] and he told his boss hey I'm leaving
[09:32] left the best job was the best employee
[09:34] the brightest person at the firm uh and
[09:36] they actually created email they
[09:38] actually created the Gmail equivalent um
[09:41] and they created a lot of things like
[09:43] the browsers and de Shaw was really an
[09:44] innovator so Jeff Bezos was behind a lot
[09:47] of these Innovations uh that a lot of
[09:49] people don't even know about uh but he
[09:51] saw this thing on the internet that was
[09:52] growing so fast and it was so large and
[09:54] he said this is going to change the
[09:55] world so that's kind of what I think
[09:57] about Bitcoin
[09:59] yeah it's really interesting and as you
[10:01] also said you're really really good in
[10:03] in Breaking something down simply
[10:05] because it's I love that you know it's
[10:07] simply Bitcoin and and your show is also
[10:09] the simple signal I think it's called Uh
[10:12] really really cool um where do you see
[10:15] um concrete like where are we going the
[10:17] next decade like I am 100% with you
[10:20] that's why I also committed this podcast
[10:22] to do it the daily Bitcoin podcast the
[10:24] next 10 years because I just see the
[10:26] massive potential in Bitcoin uh and I
[10:29] want to be as deeply involved as
[10:31] possible in this community but what's
[10:33] your what's your vision what's your
[10:36] outlook for Bitcoin over the next 10
[10:38] years and what can we look forward
[10:41] toward yeah so I think we are at the end
[10:44] of these long secular Trends so you have
[10:48] these major trends that happen in the
[10:50] world that are hundred-year Trends these
[10:54] are trends like the Industrial
[10:56] Revolution or the introduction of power
[10:59] or light or these sorts of things into
[11:01] economies broadly and so since we've
[11:04] introduced you know power in the car and
[11:06] some of these sorts of things from the
[11:08] beginning of the Industrial Revolution
[11:10] these things have sort of been
[11:11] democratized and commoditized right so
[11:14] much so that like it's not a feat
[11:17] anymore when you get on a plane and you
[11:18] fly across the world in a few hours and
[11:21] you pay a few hundred dollars and it's
[11:24] seamless right we're we're sort of at
[11:27] the end of that IND Industrial
[11:29] Revolution that changed the world so
[11:31] that's kind of one large Trend that
[11:33] we're kind of nearing the end towards
[11:35] when you also look at currencies and the
[11:37] evolution of currencies from you know
[11:39] the French having the global Reserve
[11:41] currency to the UK uh and the Sterling
[11:44] having the global Reserve currency
[11:46] around 1915 to 1921 before World War I
[11:51] into the dollar becoming the global
[11:52] Reserve currency in
[11:54] 1921 and really being solidified in 1971
[11:58] and 72 to with Bretton Woods but you
[12:01] have this kind of hundred-year trend
[12:03] where Global currencies tend to run out
[12:07] of steam and these Global superpowers
[12:10] here's another
[12:11] Trend these last you know 300 to 500
[12:15] years when you go back to the Roman
[12:18] Empire um or uh let's go with the even
[12:23] the Russian Empires or the Chinese
[12:25] Empires or even now the the American
[12:27] Empire from the early you know
[12:29] 1700s these things all have a rise and a
[12:33] decline and it's interesting that we're
[12:36] we're hitting all of these sort of
[12:37] shifts at
[12:39] once and I think Bitcoin has a role to
[12:42] play in all of these but I think the
[12:46] major thing that people
[12:50] misunderstand as we move into uh the the
[12:54] physical transformation of the world to
[12:55] the digital transformation of world of
[12:57] the world is
[12:59] we need we need a medium of exchange to
[13:03] trade value as humans in society that is
[13:07] the number one creator of economic
[13:09] activities how quickly how easily can we
[13:12] transfer value and so when that value is
[13:15] not exchange physically it has to be
[13:17] done digitally and so when you think
[13:19] about all of the other Global Reserve
[13:21] currencies uh or potential Global
[13:24] Reserve currencies with bricks or energy
[13:27] or oil or commod modities or how people
[13:30] have stored this value in bonds or real
[13:32] estate or other things as we move more
[13:35] and more towards a digital world in a
[13:37] global world there's really one asset
[13:40] that does this better than any other
[13:43] asset and so I just like to in a simple
[13:47] way as we move to the digital
[13:49] transformation of money and the exchange
[13:52] of value in a global World there is one
[13:56] asset class that does it better than
[13:57] others and and uh that happens to be
[14:00] Bitcoin and so there's like a lot of
[14:02] shifts that are happening all at once I
[14:04] think they're all colliding it's too
[14:05] early to
[14:07] tell um where Bitcoin plays on that
[14:11] stage and then what Revolution it really
[14:12] picks up on but I think it's got a 20%
[14:15] chance of catching the tail end of one
[14:18] of those right and so I I I don't know
[14:22] where we are in a in a 10year cycle but
[14:26] in a 50-year cycle Bitcoin is going to
[14:30] be and play a major role in one of these
[14:32] large Transformations really cool yeah
[14:34] it's also interesting when we look at
[14:36] like always when I put something of long
[14:38] term of like 20 or 30 or 40 years I
[14:40] always get those comments back oh like I
[14:42] will be dead back then so I try to also
[14:47] focus on like 10 years oh people are so
[14:50] shortsighted you know that's true like I
[14:53] it's really interesting uh it's it's
[14:55] like the the one comment I like if I put
[14:57] in the title and the thumbnail 2015
[14:59] I can guarantee you there are a lot of
[15:01] people in there like oh what will I do
[15:02] in 2050 I need it now like that kind of
[15:06] thing like I get that a lot even with
[15:08] not that old people like if if he's like
[15:10] 80 or 90 years old I can
[15:13] understand but but they are not that old
[15:15] but um back to the point it's really
[15:17] interesting also when we now look at all
[15:20] this deflationary forces coming into
[15:23] this feared world with like AI like this
[15:25] podcast I do everything myself and I do
[15:28] it daily and uh I hope I have a good
[15:30] enough quality and this would not be
[15:34] possible just like three four years ago
[15:36] it's amazing that that same show would
[15:39] only be possible with like maybe two
[15:40] three four people that help me bring
[15:44] everything together but now I can do it
[15:46] myself so like AI remote work all those
[15:50] uh trends that actually bring costs down
[15:52] a lot and bring this competitive thing
[15:55] uh across the globe so you can like sit
[15:57] in a Argentina but work for an American
[16:00] company and all those things uh I think
[16:02] like Bitcoin is just like one of the
[16:04] really important puzles uh to that so
[16:07] like it's a really interesting time
[16:09] where we are in and it it could play a
[16:11] massive role and then when we also have
[16:14] a deflationary money and not just like
[16:15] inflationary money as Jeff poof says
[16:17] like where are you measuring from not
[16:20] from zero but you have to calculate the
[16:22] productivity grow in it's it's
[16:24] interesting to see that uh how do you
[16:27] see Ai and and all the other Trends uh
[16:30] moving into this well I think AI has a
[16:33] massive role to play in AI I believe
[16:36] could be the only thing that potentially
[16:39] kicks the can down the road of the
[16:41] dollar Fiat collapse for another 10 to
[16:44] 20 years because when you think about
[16:47] GDP um or growth of societies they're
[16:49] really measured in like a couple things
[16:51] it's like productivity it's the growth
[16:53] of the population overall and then just
[16:56] the you know I guess economic output or
[16:58] the amount of money that's stimulated
[17:00] through that economy those things like
[17:02] kind of all roll up into increasing GDP
[17:05] and so with population you know the
[17:08] they're kind of flat to down in almost
[17:10] everywhere in the world uh people just
[17:12] aren't having kids except like me and my
[17:14] neighbors I guess there's like 13 kids
[17:16] between our three houses um four my own
[17:20] it's just a wild wild life we live but
[17:24] um AI though one of the things that it's
[17:28] going to do
[17:29] is it's going
[17:31] to displace physical people in the labor
[17:34] force for digital workers in the labor
[17:37] force and the exponential cost of an AI
[17:42] worker I was listening to the open AI um
[17:46] uh CTO talk in the recent token 2049
[17:49] conference that they had and he said a
[17:53] million tokens when they started a few
[17:54] years ago cost um $36 per million tokens
[17:59] and he said now we're at 25 cents per
[18:03] million tokens and soon to be almost at
[18:06] a cent per million tokens and so when
[18:09] you think about that when you think
[18:11] about an
[18:12] employer that is trying to keep up with
[18:16] the cost of inflation or trying to meet
[18:19] the demands of producing output in um
[18:22] economic goods for their
[18:25] customers they almost have no choice but
[18:27] to hire
[18:29] this increasingly cheaper and more
[18:31] capable employee for their company and
[18:35] so I believe that that's going to have a
[18:37] massive impact on GDP depending on how
[18:41] it's regulated and how it gets
[18:43] incorporated into businesses and so I
[18:46] think that may be the last thing that
[18:49] keeps the dollar Fiat system from
[18:51] collapsing because one of the ways that
[18:53] you can grow out of your debt problem
[18:55] our $35 trillion debt problem is by
[18:58] inflating it away or becoming that much
[19:01] more productive so the a AI has the
[19:05] potential of kicking the dollar collapse
[19:07] down down the road I don't know that it
[19:10] happens um I I I'm like I'm holding my
[19:13] breath a little bit but then also on the
[19:17] AI side if we're smart if we regulate it
[19:21] properly um it has the opportunity to um
[19:26] cause us to um exponentially grow our
[19:31] energy
[19:33] Supply so that is um creating more
[19:37] infrastructure pouring in more dollars
[19:39] towards nuclear you just saw Three Mile
[19:41] Island with Microsoft and a big deal
[19:44] that they had to uh revive that nuclear
[19:47] plant um you're seeing other nuclear
[19:49] plants come back online you're seeing
[19:52] this um massive shift in um you know
[19:55] hyar hydrocarbon transformation if you
[19:57] listen to any of the doomberg
[19:59] podcast um you're seeing solar um you
[20:03] know the the cost for solar panels and
[20:05] solar energy is like diving off of a
[20:07] cliff battery storage isn't quite there
[20:11] um but AI could be the thing that pushes
[20:13] us over the edge towards getting those
[20:15] capabilities and kicking the Fiat can
[20:17] down the road but inevitably it all ends
[20:20] in the same place you you get too big
[20:23] like that's the whole dollar milkshake
[20:25] versus uh dollar obesity Theory like in
[20:29] a nutshell is the expansion of the
[20:33] dollar and the growth um of of of all of
[20:38] this money being in the system is going
[20:39] to be the thing that kills it inevitably
[20:41] what is we talked about that before and
[20:43] I saw it also that you have it as a pin
[20:45] tweet and I I heard that word uh already
[20:48] but I never really researched it what is
[20:50] the dollar milkshed Theory and what is
[20:52] the dollar obesity uh Theory and and how
[20:55] to they differentiate yeah they're
[20:57] they're kind of two in the same but with
[21:00] uh different outcomes or different
[21:02] proposed outcomes so the dollar
[21:04] milkshake theory was coined by uh Brent
[21:07] Johnson from Santiago Capital um in
[21:11] about 2018 he started coming on R Pal's
[21:14] podcast uh real vision and started
[21:18] talking about this idea that uh the
[21:21] dollar will only continue to strengthen
[21:23] over time because 87% of global trade
[21:27] happens in the
[21:29] dollar um you have a large majority of
[21:32] Institutions Banks um intermediaries
[21:35] that use the dollar to settle for trade
[21:37] and then they go to other currencies
[21:39] after and then you have the euro dollar
[21:42] market which all that means is the the
[21:45] Euro uh the euro dollar market is they
[21:48] can't actually create dollars themselves
[21:50] the fed's the only one that can do it so
[21:52] they post US dollar collateral in create
[21:56] dollars out of thin air so basically
[22:00] even the Euro Market itself is propped
[22:02] up by Dollar denominated assets and so
[22:08] when the dollar rises in price um or
[22:11] gets stronger uh this creates more
[22:14] pressure for everyone around the globe
[22:17] um because their dollar denominated
[22:19] debts um are
[22:22] increasing um and their payments towards
[22:25] the US
[22:26] increase but when the dollar
[22:29] decreases in strength or it's kind of
[22:32] deflationary well one it creates more
[22:35] inflation for our economy and then the
[22:39] FED tends to cut rates and do these
[22:41] sorts of things which causes our asset
[22:43] prices to rise our economy to rise and
[22:47] therefore it's rising faster than their
[22:50] Global economies so then more dollars
[22:52] come into the
[22:53] US and so it just creates this cycle of
[22:56] the dollar continues to get stronger as
[22:58] more and more people become relling on
[23:00] it and so all of that liquidity creates
[23:02] kind of this cocktail he calls the
[23:04] dollar milkshake theory he believes in
[23:07] in what I would say is that um a move
[23:10] away from the dollar is untenable unless
[23:13] we move to a gold
[23:14] standard overnight he believes that the
[23:18] G7 countries are going to um work
[23:23] together and just finger snap all of
[23:27] their debt away by saying the new price
[23:29] of gold is $20,000 an ounce and so no
[23:32] one has debt anymore that sort of resets
[23:35] the system gold goes to the moon and the
[23:37] players who have power now continue to
[23:40] be in power um I think it's a bit
[23:42] shortsighted I think that means that
[23:44] these G7 nations would have to trust
[23:47] each other they would have to coordinate
[23:50] with each other they would have to be
[23:51] able to settle they would have to be
[23:52] able to audit and confirm who has how
[23:54] much gold and I don't think that we're
[23:56] becoming friends with Russia or China
[23:58] any time soon I
[24:00] just uh I I don't think that's likely um
[24:05] but who knows maybe something crazy
[24:07] could happen and so the dollar obesity
[24:11] Theory coined by Preston pish says that
[24:15] these smaller countries in economies are
[24:18] realizing that they can't escape the IMF
[24:21] or the dollar and they're looking for
[24:24] ways out like Bhutan like El Salvador
[24:27] and they're adopting an alternative
[24:29] system that Jeff Booth talks about uh in
[24:32] Bitcoin and then all of these Sovereign
[24:35] Nations regardless of whether people
[24:37] believe it or not they're Sovereign
[24:39] because they they have the majority of
[24:42] energy resources so if it's Saudi Arabia
[24:45] if it's Russia um if it's India if it's
[24:48] the United States um the more likely
[24:53] situation would be for us to compete on
[24:56] an energy standard which would be Den at
[24:58] in Bitcoin versus an oil standard or a
[25:02] gold standard and so that's the dollar
[25:05] obesity Theory the dollar becomes so big
[25:08] we have to protect the dollar in so many
[25:10] places that we just Gorge ourselves on
[25:13] dollars we just we just until we become
[25:15] a 500 pound person on the couch that
[25:17] can't move and that's what ends up
[25:19] killing us and gold won't be the winner
[25:23] at the end of that Bitcoin will be the
[25:25] winner so dollar milkshake Theory gold
[25:28] dollar obesity Theory
[25:31] Bitcoin I love that I like how you break
[25:34] it down also um do do you think that
[25:38] money eventually like now we're in a
[25:41] weird state where there are so many
[25:42] different currencies uh so many
[25:44] different forms of money you could even
[25:46] like uh argue like oh like Bitcoin there
[25:49] is a currency then we have the US
[25:51] Dollars we have Euro then there's like
[25:52] bricks thing then there's also so many
[25:54] small currencies uh Egypt and all those
[25:58] those things um but is it eventually a
[26:01] vinner takes it all of of the whole
[26:03] whole earth it's like one uh money that
[26:06] that rules all or is there like a chance
[26:09] that there might be a second one or
[26:10] third one or like the the fat monetary
[26:13] system might actually stick around for a
[26:16] long time I think in some form or
[26:18] fashion it's going to stick around for a
[26:19] long time I don't think Bitcoin becomes
[26:22] the the thing that we trade in or we
[26:24] denominate things in I think it becomes
[26:26] the measuring stick behind
[26:29] um all of these different currencies I I
[26:32] believe that Bitcoin is the stable um
[26:36] nonf
[26:37] funable uh or or the fungible um non-
[26:42] manipulatable um thing that we determine
[26:45] as the Baseline for pricing all of these
[26:47] other currencies
[26:48] in um and I believe that there will
[26:52] still continue to be a lot of currencies
[26:54] I believe that there's like 120
[26:55] currencies out there or somewhere around
[26:57] that number that's just unfeasible and
[27:00] untenable um that number will shrink and
[27:03] that number will decrease um I believe
[27:07] that there is a real future and a real
[27:10] use case for stable coins I'm not like a
[27:13] huge fan um but they are being used
[27:17] worldwide it's just like
[27:19] undeniable um especially as you talk
[27:21] about this AI world and this AI future
[27:23] where a person Works in Argentina but
[27:26] they're a resident of another
[27:28] country um and they're paying a
[27:31] contractor in another country somewhere
[27:33] else along across the world like these
[27:37] things are not going to be interchanged
[27:39] across five currencies anymore we're
[27:41] just going to use one currency whether
[27:42] it's
[27:43] usdt um or some other thing in order to
[27:47] kind of stabilize transactions but I
[27:49] believe Bitcoin will be the reserve
[27:50] currency of the world I do believe that
[27:53] I don't believe it'll be the thing that
[27:55] we trade in or trade on what is uh this
[27:58] is the case and and Bitcoin is uh no
[28:00] matter when this this will happen but
[28:03] when this actually happens and Bitcoin
[28:05] is the world Reserve currency uh World
[28:07] Reserve asset that is behind it and is
[28:10] the measurement stick what does that
[28:12] mean for the world like what impact does
[28:14] it have is it then uh the whole world a
[28:17] little bit more capitalistic uh is the
[28:19] this this government overreach uh
[28:21] limited or how do you how do you see
[28:23] that uh I I really I'm like really
[28:26] hopeful for
[28:29] like this
[28:31] altruistic Level Playing Field like I'm
[28:33] an athlete right uh I'm a former
[28:36] division one football player uh my
[28:38] family uh my in-laws like we're all
[28:41] we're all athletes I'm I'm around Sports
[28:43] all the time um I'm really hopeful for
[28:47] this Level Playing Field um this new
[28:49] economic Constitution being instituted
[28:51] by Bitcoin where we all have the same
[28:54] rules that we play on it's the same
[28:56] playing field we have one referee
[28:58] and that is the Bitcoin protocol and you
[29:01] put up points by generating and creating
[29:03] economic productivity and you are
[29:06] rewarded through
[29:07] sets um like I really believe in this
[29:11] proof of work idea that the the the
[29:16] meritocracy in you just work hard you
[29:20] create value and you're rewarded for
[29:22] that um now here's where I think
[29:28] Humanity tends to lend itself um I'm a
[29:33] um I'm a Christian and so I've read the
[29:36] Bible and a lot of people have a lot of
[29:37] thoughts about the Bible and all of
[29:40] these things and whether they're true
[29:41] and what it promotes or what it doesn't
[29:43] what it says to me is when you look at
[29:45] all of the wars and all of the
[29:47] corruption and all of the greed and all
[29:50] of the dictators and all of the slavery
[29:52] and all of the oppression that happens
[29:54] around the world it feels like a pretty
[29:56] realistic recounting
[29:58] of human
[29:59] nature regardless of what you believe
[30:02] you can look it through any history book
[30:03] and overlay that against the Bible and
[30:05] go hm this actually looks like what
[30:07] people act like when they tend to get
[30:08] power when they tend to get resources
[30:11] when they tend to get a higher view of
[30:12] themselves and ultimately there are
[30:15] these Cycles where these nations are at
[30:19] War and now it's not tribe versus tribe
[30:24] it's Iran versus Israel and nuclear Wars
[30:27] It's China versus the United States
[30:30] right it's Muhammad Ali versus Joe
[30:33] Frasier right the the fights have just
[30:35] gotten bigger and the scale by which
[30:38] people can inflict damage has gotten
[30:41] greater and so I really hope that this
[30:44] world resets without a World War But
[30:47] ultimately whether it's Bitcoin
[30:49] happening through this
[30:52] meritocracy of the people that can
[30:53] harness the most energy and input it
[30:55] into the Bitcoin system um and we're all
[30:58] on a Level Playing Field or it happens
[31:00] via War which I think is probably more
[31:03] likely the case this hierarchy maslo of
[31:08] like the maso's hierarchy of needs like
[31:10] you have this triangle of of at the top
[31:14] there's all of these things that don't
[31:15] matter and I think that's where we're at
[31:17] as a society like 50% of people's
[31:21] discretionary income is not on like food
[31:24] and housing and other things anymore
[31:26] it's on like subscriptions to Netflix
[31:28] and door Dash and all of these things
[31:30] that like at the end of the day like
[31:33] I've got like 10 hoodies in here like 10
[31:35] Bitcoin hoodies right it's like I only
[31:37] need one or two and so when these resets
[31:41] happen we reset as a human race back
[31:45] down that triangle of our
[31:47] needs and what that does is it levels
[31:51] the playing field it it removes the
[31:53] excess of all of the things that we
[31:55] don't need and that allows us to reset
[31:58] on a new standard when that new standard
[32:01] is Bitcoin we then begin to trade we be
[32:04] we then begin to barter we then begin to
[32:08] um put new
[32:11] transactions onto this foundational
[32:13] layer based upon our Merit and not upon
[32:16] our debt it's the great debt Jubilee in
[32:19] my opinion um and it only and it happens
[32:22] two ways um it happens either we
[32:25] willingly choose this or it happens via
[32:27] War
[32:28] um but in that new world and in that new
[32:30] standard it's completely based upon the
[32:33] amount of value that you're able to
[32:35] generate and the amount of
[32:39] um the amount of I think people globally
[32:43] that you're able to connect with to
[32:44] exchange value with if you watch or
[32:46] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[32:48] I'll guess you already bought some
[32:51] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[32:53] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[32:57] in a hardware wallet my personal
[32:58] recommendation for hard wallet is the
[33:01] bitbox it's super secure it's simple to
[33:03] set up it's also perfect gift for friend
[33:06] who has still the Bitcoin on an exchange
[33:09] and you can get a 5% discount with the
[33:12] code Robin at the check out visit bitbox
[33:15] do Swiss robobin to get your bitbox and
[33:19] the next step is to really level up your
[33:22] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[33:24] have the most secure self custody setup
[33:27] you have to secure your own devices you
[33:30] have to protect your privacy you have to
[33:33] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[33:36] on where you live you even want to have
[33:38] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[33:41] move in case something goes really
[33:43] really wrong and through all those steps
[33:45] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[33:47] step by step and if you visit the
[33:50] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners SL Robin
[33:54] you even get a 30 minute free call to
[33:56] find out how You Can level up your
[33:59] sovereignty and last but not least I
[34:01] have something completely new for you
[34:04] guys I partnered up with coin vigilante
[34:08] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[34:11] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[34:14] look at that beauty I love it so much
[34:16] coin vigilante made in perfect Bitcoin
[34:19] watch that's the perfect subtle elegent
[34:22] way to go out there and show that you
[34:25] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[34:28] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[34:31] dropped a completely new and amazing
[34:34] Genesis edition of their watch
[34:36] collections you have the date of the
[34:39] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[34:42] and of course also the block height and
[34:45] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[34:48] level of detail they put in in this
[34:51] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[34:53] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[34:56] down in the descriptions I love those
[34:59] watches so so much and those two ways
[35:02] are really interesting uh when you look
[35:04] at them uh as you said like either we
[35:06] are just switching intentionally there
[35:09] or we have a war and I'm really
[35:13] conflicted with those two because both
[35:15] could be could be true but the more and
[35:18] more I see the difference between
[35:22] hardcore bitcoiners and the overall
[35:25] Society I'm like there's such a big
[35:28] difference and there are such big forces
[35:30] that want to hang on this feared world
[35:32] that it almost has to end up not
[35:36] peacefully or like some sort of War some
[35:38] sort of conflict it's it's really hard
[35:41] to uh imagine a world where we slowly
[35:44] dive into that and it's a peaceful
[35:46] Revolution even though we talk a lot
[35:48] about that but I have a hard time
[35:49] believing that it will be really
[35:50] peaceful uh to a certain to a certain
[35:53] extent I agree with that I mean and I
[35:55] think we wrestle between these two these
[35:57] two states right you have apathy and
[36:01] then you have people that are kind of um
[36:04] I would say controlled by the narratives
[36:06] and the media and what people are are
[36:08] told and so these are apathetic people
[36:12] in general which is nothing's going to
[36:14] change anyway or they're so blinded by
[36:18] maybe what they're told that they don't
[36:20] realize what's going on and then there's
[36:23] the complete opposite side which is
[36:25] full-on narcissism and full-on
[36:28] Rebellion which is I think some Maxis
[36:31] Bitcoin Maxis can get to the spot which
[36:32] I don't think is a bad thing but you get
[36:35] to this point to where you're always
[36:36] shaking your fist at the system and you
[36:39] know this isn't how things should work
[36:41] and it's not where it should go and you
[36:43] can get so far into
[36:46] narcissism that um it becomes
[36:50] unproductive and I think you have to
[36:52] have this balance in between and I think
[36:55] Bitcoin this is the thing that trying to
[36:57] get across to
[36:59] people it has the ability to help you
[37:02] accomplish
[37:03] both because you can get the
[37:07] life-changing
[37:09] returns of playing the game how it's
[37:11] traditionally been played when you look
[37:13] at the compound annual growth rates of
[37:15] Bitcoin you know Michael sailor says
[37:17] since 2013 it's what I don't know 46% or
[37:20] whatever he used in his last uh
[37:22] presentation the compound annual growth
[37:24] rate when you go back to 2013 if you
[37:26] look at any four-year period it's never
[37:27] gone below the low 20% rate and so you
[37:31] have this asset that is like a high beta
[37:35] stock like Nvidia or Amazon in terms of
[37:39] its returns you have the commodity
[37:42] profile of gold or copper or some of
[37:46] these other things that's actually
[37:47] designated as a commodity by the
[37:51] secc the cftc in the IRS if you live in
[37:55] the United States so they actually say
[37:57] it's a commodity and property and then
[38:00] you also have the ability to secure and
[38:03] store it for much cheaper than you could
[38:06] with
[38:07] gold and so I don't I I guess I don't
[38:11] understand the play for not getting
[38:13] Bitcoin because you can play the game
[38:17] better than the people who are playing
[38:20] the game with the
[38:21] returns but you can also get the
[38:25] sovereignty and you can get the benefits
[38:29] of being fully Sovereign and fully in
[38:33] control of your destiny with Bitcoin by
[38:36] writing down 12 or 24 words or multisig
[38:39] or you know uh geographical you know
[38:43] dispersed custody right these sorts of
[38:45] ideas that are not that hard to
[38:47] implement like we're not talking about
[38:49] rocket science where you could get all
[38:51] the benefits and beat them at their own
[38:53] game so I just don't understand for
[38:56] people like you you have all the options
[38:58] in the world now that you can own real
[39:01] Bitcoin and have greater
[39:04] returns and if you do enough study you
[39:06] do enough homework you run your own node
[39:09] you hold your own Keys you're ready for
[39:12] the bunker days
[39:13] too I don't know why it has to be this
[39:16] you know this fight back and forth you
[39:18] can be apathetic and yeah this is how
[39:20] the world's going to continue to go and
[39:22] you can also shake your fist buy Bitcoin
[39:25] and put it in self- custody as in just
[39:27] is also I feel like that some a lot of
[39:29] people uh that have problems coming into
[39:32] the Bitcoin world are frightened by this
[39:36] volatility this this like up and down
[39:38] volatility and it's it's so interesting
[39:41] uh I recently uh posted a chart of the
[39:44] four-year moving average bitcoin price
[39:47] and this completely Smooths it out and
[39:49] it's just like a straight line up and
[39:51] it's such a beautiful thing and you also
[39:53] said to me before I I don't remember if
[39:55] it was recorded or or before we recorded
[39:58] but you said you're also big on uh
[40:00] teaching people how to zoom out and and
[40:02] not being too much in the moment but
[40:04] zooming out with the Bitcoin price why
[40:06] is that so hard for people and why is it
[40:08] so important to to zoom out um well one
[40:11] I think it's because when you hear the
[40:14] narratives and some of it is intentional
[40:16] I want to be very clear the mainstream
[40:20] media uh the Ross sorens of the world um
[40:23] anyone who gets um a platform that is of
[40:27] the mainstream will always use the term
[40:31] speculative right so some of it is I
[40:35] think intentional training um against
[40:37] Bitcoin I don't think it's a coincidence
[40:39] that they all use the same word just
[40:40] like I don't think it's coincidence that
[40:43] um that you know KLA Harris says that
[40:46] she grew up middle class in every
[40:48] interview that she has right there's a
[40:50] message that she's trying to communicate
[40:52] it's like what what how's the weather
[40:54] today I grew up in the middle class it's
[40:57] like this has nothing to do with the
[40:58] question but so at some point it is
[41:01] intentional that they want to um I think
[41:04] create this narrative around Bitcoin as
[41:06] it's a speculative volatile Casino like
[41:10] asset and I actually ran some of the
[41:12] numbers on this uh I actually did this
[41:14] for one of my recent shows let me let me
[41:16] pull this up I'm not going to put on my
[41:18] screen but I just need to get it on my
[41:19] own notes um so I just wanted to like I
[41:23] always help people to think like don't
[41:26] think intry year think calendar year in
[41:30] multi-year in terms of the returns of
[41:33] Bitcoin and so when you look at this
[41:37] give me one second here I ran some
[41:39] numbers on the likelihood of winning in
[41:42] a particular game at the
[41:44] casino and so if you look at the numbers
[41:47] U your likelihood of winning in slots is
[41:51] 40% next is roulette at
[41:54] 44.7% the next is let it ride at
[41:58] 46.5% the next is poker at
[42:02] 46.6% the next is Blackjack at
[42:06] 48% and then the highest opportunity to
[42:10] beat the house uh is craps at 48.6% or
[42:13] backarat at
[42:15] 48.8% so almost a 50/50 Edge but the
[42:18] house still has the edge and so when you
[42:21] look at Bitcoin uh I ran the numbers and
[42:25] I pulled the daily price um returns all
[42:28] the way back to 2013 uh because the
[42:31] numbers would be even crazier and bigger
[42:32] if you go back past 2013 um so I just
[42:35] for people to not have their faces
[42:37] melted off uh I just stop at
[42:40] 2013 and so um for Bitcoin your odds of
[42:44] winning in the casino are 96.0 6%
[42:48] meaning that if you hold Bitcoin for any
[42:50] foure period within this time frame of
[42:55] 2013 through today you have a
[42:59] 96.66% chance of a positive return and
[43:03] so if you hold it for one
[43:05] year your probability of positive return
[43:08] is
[43:09] 70.3% with the average return being
[43:12] 90% this is going back to that time that
[43:14] time period the average returns right so
[43:17] we're not looking at the compound just
[43:19] the average the two-year holding period
[43:21] at
[43:22] 79% with the average return being
[43:24] 233% the three-year holding period
[43:27] period the probability of a positive
[43:28] return is
[43:30] 90% with the average returns being
[43:33] 565 and the four-year holding period
[43:36] again it's 96% with the average return
[43:38] being
[43:39] 1,100% so it's actually not like a
[43:43] casino at
[43:44] all uh and a lot of people get caught in
[43:47] these intraday returns and when you look
[43:50] at any five-day stretch it's it's
[43:52] actually really interesting between
[43:55] today October 1st 2014 or 2024 happy
[43:59] October everybody and going back to
[44:02] October 1st of
[44:03] 2014 you actually have at any 5-day
[44:07] period the highest amount of draw Downs
[44:10] that you see is like
[44:12] 48% but the 5-day upside volatility the
[44:16] number one ranking day or 5-day stretch
[44:18] is
[44:20] 61% so Bitcoin has a lot of these
[44:23] downward draw downs but the upward
[44:25] volatility is so much higher it's so
[44:28] much greater and it's so much faster and
[44:30] when you zoom out to these fouryear
[44:32] Cycles it's a pattern at this point
[44:35] right you call it luck once okay twice
[44:38] okay you've you're having a good day
[44:41] three times in a row where I see three
[44:43] down year or three up years one down
[44:45] year um it's it's a pattern and that's
[44:49] what we're seeing play out and so for
[44:52] all the people out there that think
[44:53] Bitcoin is a casino it's speculative
[44:57] and it's gambling well the data and the
[45:00] numbers don't suggest that
[45:02] whatsoever I don't understand how that
[45:04] could be the narrative if you want to
[45:05] take five minutes to do the
[45:07] effort it's also interesting most people
[45:10] who say uh Bitcoin is speculative then
[45:14] go ahead and inv invest in lottery
[45:17] tickets and then go ahead and and and
[45:20] play in casinos like that or invest in
[45:23] some extremely
[45:25] small uh start uh just like started up
[45:29] on on the stock exchange small startup
[45:31] because it's not the the main name and
[45:33] it's like sounds fancy and stuff like
[45:35] that it's it's I see it all over with
[45:37] with my friends maybe that's just
[45:39] subjective but I see it with so many
[45:41] people who are like oh no Bitcoin is too
[45:43] speculative to volatile and then they're
[45:44] doing all those things that are way more
[45:47] speculative way more risky way more uh
[45:50] volatile than Bitcoin ever was so that's
[45:54] that's that's one thing and and the
[45:55] zooming out is is important I love the
[45:58] fews with like comparing the numbers of
[46:01] like Blackjack I think was the the the
[46:04] highest return that I remember the other
[46:05] two games that were higher I I don't
[46:07] even know about them but Blackjack I
[46:10] know that that's really interesting and
[46:12] I think it it helps people to to think
[46:15] about Bitcoin not in that speculative
[46:18] way and to think about Bitcoin as what
[46:21] it actually is when you look at the
[46:22] numbers and not just like headlines and
[46:24] narratives that other people might want
[46:27] you uh to believe in I love that input
[46:31] of yours really cool I mean yeah I mean
[46:34] and one other thing too I think one of I
[46:36] mean you had uh Leon on your podcast a
[46:38] few episodes ago and I think people are
[46:42] now waking up to this idea that real
[46:44] estate is more speculative than they
[46:46] thought and and even in the United
[46:48] States like my mom lives in North
[46:51] Carolina and she hasn't had power since
[46:55] Wednesday night or Thursday day um from
[46:58] from the from the latest hurricane and
[47:01] entire towns um and again this is a
[47:04] threat of you know what Michael sailor
[47:06] calls an act of God or natural
[47:09] disaster but we have you know several
[47:13] cases of this within the last 20 years
[47:16] with Hurricane Katrina hurricane Ian and
[47:18] now hurricane Helen it's sort of like
[47:22] yeah this isn't a statistical
[47:24] improbability this is almost a
[47:27] statistical probability that if you live
[47:29] within a certain zone or a certain
[47:31] region that could be mountainous it
[47:34] could be completely detached from the
[47:37] ocean some of these places that have
[47:38] been wrecked like Tennessee or or these
[47:40] other places in in you know North
[47:42] Carolina on the on the western side are
[47:45] not close to the ocean what you would
[47:47] typically consider places to be in a
[47:49] hurricane flood zone and so people have
[47:52] to really begin to ask questions about
[47:56] is real EST State um as protected of an
[48:00] asset class or um resistant to um
[48:06] disaster or risk that I thought it was
[48:09] yeah real estate is is a big one it's
[48:11] also for me um people see it especially
[48:14] in Austra I don't know how it's in in
[48:15] America but also a lot of people see
[48:17] real estate as their personal savings
[48:20] account instead like oh like I just buy
[48:23] a house live in that pay the mortgage
[48:25] for like 30 years and and that's it
[48:28] that's my investment strategy for my
[48:29] whole life uh and it played out not that
[48:33] bad in in uh before Bitcoin uh because
[48:36] real estate was a good asset uh but you
[48:39] had to deal with a lot of things and
[48:40] then you had the risk of uh as you said
[48:42] like the natural disasters and stuff
[48:43] like that but for me real estate is a
[48:45] business like uh I don't know why we we
[48:49] even uh have to compare real estate with
[48:52] Bitcoin because real estate is not not
[48:53] an investment it's just a business that
[48:55] you have to where you get income uh the
[48:58] savings that we have with Bitcoin there
[49:01] is no income from that like there should
[49:03] not be a yield on that guy it's
[49:05] interesting for me how people can
[49:07] confuse those well I mean they say oh
[49:08] you can't spend your Bitcoin I mean I
[49:10] don't know if you saw this yesterday or
[49:12] two days ago the state of Ohio actually
[49:14] will allow people to pay their taxes
[49:15] their State uh state taxes in Bitcoin um
[49:20] but it's like you don't pay for things
[49:21] with your bedroom either uh no what
[49:24] people do is they take a home equity
[49:28] line of credit out in the United States
[49:30] a second mortgage and they get cash from
[49:34] the appraised value of this house which
[49:37] again is a subjective measure that they
[49:39] then take the cash out of and then use
[49:43] it to renovate or to update or to buy
[49:45] more stocks or other things and so the
[49:48] cash value or the appraised value of
[49:50] their house continues to go up and so
[49:52] it's it's kind of like a
[49:54] renewable this renewable C cash bounds
[49:57] that then they then withdraw to then
[49:59] using the real world in the economy and
[50:01] so it's stored up from their house but
[50:03] in Bitcoin that same Paradigm is coming
[50:07] you're going to be able to borrow
[50:08] against your Bitcoin just like you do a
[50:11] home equity line of credit because
[50:13] here's the thing the home equity line of
[50:15] credit has a quote unquote appraised
[50:17] value and when home prices come down the
[50:21] banks are going to come say oh we need a
[50:22] new appraisal because that value doesn't
[50:24] look the same and then those assets are
[50:27] risk um and then the kind of the last
[50:30] thing there from a bank from a
[50:32] collateral standpoint do you want to
[50:34] come to somebody's house with you know
[50:36] dog the Repo Man the Bounty Hunter he's
[50:39] a famous bounty hunter in the United
[50:41] States his name's Dog the Bounty Hunter
[50:44] um do you want to come to somebody's
[50:46] house with Dog the Bounty Hunter force
[50:48] their family out liquidate all their
[50:50] furniture on Facebook Marketplace or do
[50:53] you want to sign a transaction in a
[50:54] multisig that gives you the rights to
[50:57] that property if someone defaults I
[51:00] think every Bank in America from a cost
[51:03] in a ability to capture that asset value
[51:07] would say Bitcoin 10 times out of 10
[51:10] it's interesting why it's not already
[51:11] there it's like already uh the most
[51:14] pristine collateral Bitcoin I mean of
[51:16] course we need time to like get to the
[51:18] state where everyone gets it and do
[51:20] those products has have to develop uh
[51:23] but yeah it's it's it's a no-brainer for
[51:25] me to have Bitcoin as collateral you
[51:27] have a multi signature Solutions where
[51:30] you can do multi with the bank and third
[51:33] party and all those things like it's
[51:34] it's it's quite easy also to like not
[51:37] quite easy but it's it's it's relatively
[51:39] easy to set up H and and you don't need
[51:42] as you said with the house you don't
[51:43] have to force people out one thing that
[51:45] I want to get also in uh you you
[51:47] mentioned camela and then I thought like
[51:50] how big do you think it is that uh Trump
[51:54] and RFK and VI
[51:57] that kind of
[51:58] administration um that might even be the
[52:03] future Administration when Trump wins
[52:06] that there are actually bitcoiners in
[52:07] there I mean we can discuss how how much
[52:09] of a Bitcoin Donald Trump is but I think
[52:12] RFK is already way deeper in there and R
[52:16] Ramos maybe also how big is it for
[52:19] America and then also for the world that
[52:22] there are those bitcoiners or on the
[52:24] journey to being bitcoiners
[52:27] uh in the administration huge um I I
[52:31] personally don't think that um Donald is
[52:35] a real real big bitcoiner um he's got
[52:38] his uh his his Liberty dii token or
[52:41] whatever that's out and I'm like man he
[52:44] couldn't have waited like two weeks or
[52:46] three weeks um in order to launch this
[52:48] this just doesn't look very good but the
[52:51] people on his team and in his cabinet
[52:53] like you mentioned uh VC you mentioned
[52:55] RFK
[52:57] um you know JD Vance and others these
[52:59] people are are are serious about Bitcoin
[53:01] and Bitcoin Innovation and I think more
[53:03] importantly than just even Bitcoin
[53:05] energy dominance um removing ourselves
[53:09] you know you actually just saw um Donald
[53:11] Trump um with uh he did doing an
[53:14] interview with zalinski from Ukraine
[53:17] right kind of shrinking the size of the
[53:20] military industrial complex he's made
[53:23] comments and remarks out there about um
[53:26] decre ining the strength of the dollar
[53:29] um by not meddling in other places in
[53:31] the world in the country and like to his
[53:33] point his hat right make America great
[53:36] again I think it has major implications
[53:38] for the rest of the world um as as
[53:42] America sets the standard for what
[53:43] happens in the financial markets
[53:45] regardless of what people like to think
[53:47] like America our number one export is
[53:50] financial services right we are we are
[53:52] the financial engine of the world um and
[53:56] so I think it has massive implications
[53:58] for uh probably not like Bitcoin
[54:01] specifically but all of the things
[54:03] around Bitcoin are we going to start
[54:05] building nuclear reactors are we going
[54:06] to start investing into energy resources
[54:09] are we going to become the dominant
[54:10] player in chip manufacturing or is that
[54:13] going to kind of continue to live in the
[54:15] eastern part of the world those sorts of
[54:17] things for America specifically because
[54:19] that's the context I'm speaking from are
[54:21] really critical I I'm I have pretty
[54:25] strong feelings that
[54:27] the Democratic elected
[54:30] party does not believe the same
[54:33] things um and so we're going to probably
[54:36] see several different Futures kind of
[54:39] binary
[54:41] outcomes um in terms of energy dominance
[54:44] and
[54:45] Bitcoin um based upon which party is
[54:47] elected and um I don't think Donald
[54:51] himself is a real big
[54:53] corner he he he might be I think uh I
[54:57] think Max Kaiser was like this this
[54:59] stage model where you are on stage one
[55:01] and you want to fix Bitcoin and you have
[55:02] your own shitcoin it's like he's on on
[55:05] stage one and uh maybe maybe in the
[55:08] fouryear administration uh with with RFK
[55:11] with with jady van with maybe other
[55:14] people that come into the administration
[55:16] and Bitcoin is influencing him along the
[55:18] way uh maybe he gets to to the point but
[55:22] uh for Bitcoin not that important but it
[55:24] would be interesting for America as as
[55:26] as marus as you said all the financial
[55:28] services and they had yesterday I talked
[55:31] with uh Chris from coin shares about
[55:34] that that the Bitcoin ETF is such a huge
[55:37] thing in America uh and in the world
[55:39] actually like everyone paid attention to
[55:41] bitcoin ETF but in Europe since 2015
[55:44] there's a Bitcoin ETP which which is
[55:46] basically an ETF but they cannot call it
[55:49] ETF um and even like have a really nice
[55:52] product where you can take uh physical
[55:55] delivery of your Bitcoin directly and
[55:56] not cash uh which is not possible with
[55:59] the American one so it's it's
[56:00] interesting like when when America does
[56:02] something the whole world listens and it
[56:04] has actually a big weight on it so uh
[56:09] America being more and more Bitcoin
[56:11] friendly and more and more Bitcoin
[56:13] focused also in the political discussion
[56:16] is something that will influence EU and
[56:18] will influence all the other places as
[56:20] as I see it so I think it's a as you
[56:23] said like a huge uh impact I really love
[56:26] what you were saying about that um
[56:29] perfect then uh we we come closer to the
[56:32] end routine uh of of of our podcast uh
[56:35] one question that I always ask all my
[56:36] guests is what can we learn from you
[56:39] besides uh Bitcoin uh you guys want my
[56:43] life philosophies now
[56:45] um I would say um things so um I
[56:51] recognize um our society has put a great
[56:55] deal deal of weight importance and
[56:59] attention on content creators and
[57:02] influencers and it's very topheavy and I
[57:05] want to send a message to all of those
[57:07] folks out there um because I'm I'm kind
[57:10] of now one of those people one of the
[57:11] content creators the YouTube guys
[57:13] whatever that is I always tell people
[57:16] the people that comment um on your
[57:19] YouTube videos or your podcast online
[57:21] are not the same people that will make
[57:25] remarks at your fun feral and and I want
[57:28] people to understand that
[57:30] distinction that it's probably better to
[57:34] be more famous in your neighborhood than
[57:37] it is to be more famous on your social
[57:39] network and I I I um I want to ask
[57:43] people like you've listened to you know
[57:46] 100 hours of of Jeff Booth or or me or
[57:49] or anyone else you know do you know your
[57:53] neighbors um do you have a set of
[57:56] parents and and people if you're a
[57:58] parent um that you're you're so tight
[58:01] with that you can avoid what Jonathan
[58:05] height calls this anxious generation
[58:07] dilemma where the rate of suicide and
[58:11] the rate of depression and um anxiety
[58:14] disorders has kind of skyrocketed since
[58:17] 2013 and 2012 when Instagram came out
[58:20] and the lowest common denominator or the
[58:23] weakest link in your parent group or
[58:25] friend group is is going to be what
[58:26] causes your kids and your friends to go
[58:29] down that rabbit hole which we know
[58:31] isn't good for them do you know your
[58:33] community do you know your neighbors do
[58:34] they know you and then lastly you know
[58:38] how are we going to solve our future
[58:41] Generations problem if there is no
[58:43] future
[58:44] generation so um I I just want to like
[58:48] really encourage people if you're afraid
[58:51] if you're fearful maybe if you don't
[58:52] feel like you have the money or the time
[58:56] those are unfounded fears when it comes
[58:58] to having children because your children
[59:02] actually make you more economically
[59:04] productive talk yourself up you can
[59:07] listen to every horoi podcast every H hu
[59:11] hubman podcast out there get in a cold
[59:13] Tub Run five miles but there's nothing
[59:16] that gets you and force you to grind
[59:19] harder than a crying baby so those are a
[59:23] couple thoughts unfounded people can
[59:25] have them take reli him but that's kind
[59:27] of my thoughts outside of
[59:29] Bitcoin I love that a lot and it's
[59:32] interesting because if uh you just think
[59:35] like uh from from like the first thought
[59:38] it's like oh yeah like kids that they
[59:40] they cost that much like you have this
[59:42] figures like a kid cost half a million
[59:43] or a million whatever figure you're
[59:45] looking at and then people go ahead like
[59:47] oh I cannot cannot afford a kid but then
[59:51] you have all those examples of people
[59:54] that have kids and have family and have
[59:57] those values and they are super
[59:59] successful that there's like a
[60:00] correlation between them having kids
[60:04] family and and marriage and all those
[60:06] things versus uh them not having that
[60:09] and the other the first one is just way
[60:12] more successful I mean poster child of
[60:15] that is El musk with 12 kids I guess uh
[60:18] he he's super successful and he has 12
[60:20] kids uh and there there is a I think
[60:23] that this the this this having this
[60:26] inner urge to provide for some other
[60:28] human beings that is not yourself and
[60:30] that is something bigger than yourself
[60:32] it it's it's really interesting how this
[60:34] this drives you to to grind harder I
[60:37] cannot understand that because I don't
[60:39] have kids but I observe that with so
[60:41] many other people and I think that's a
[60:44] beautiful thing and as one of my other
[60:47] guests uh said make more babies this
[60:50] like one of the the slogans of
[60:52] bitcoiners I guess and I love that you
[60:54] brought it also in the podcast there
[60:55] thank you so much much for that Dante uh
[60:58] really cool um now we have an endro te
[61:00] where the previous guest is asking a
[61:02] question for the next guest without
[61:03] knowing who the next guest is and it's
[61:06] about digital identities what would the
[61:09] world look like if we can control our
[61:11] own digital identities uh I just so you
[61:14] have context to the question uh this was
[61:17] the guy who is right now in El Salvador
[61:20] and trying that with a hospital to put
[61:23] the identities on Nostra which is an
[61:26] really interesting uh uh starting
[61:29] project I forgot how this protocol is
[61:32] called I think salute protocol or
[61:33] something like that that's built on
[61:35] Nostra it's an interesting very very
[61:37] very very very early stage uh thing um
[61:42] but the general idea is like not the
[61:44] hospital and medical or any other
[61:46] institution has them has the data but
[61:48] you have your own data and you can give
[61:50] it to the institution if they want to
[61:52] what do you think about that I think
[61:53] it's really important we didn't get into
[61:55] this in the AI discussion but Jensen
[61:57] Wong from Nvidia Nvidia CEO said that
[62:02] the ability for AI Bots and agents to
[62:06] create fake data fake content fake news
[62:09] and fake information is going to
[62:11] increase at a rate that's exponential
[62:13] that we don't have the ability to
[62:14] believe his solution which I thought was
[62:17] ironic for someone who's selling chips
[62:19] was we need AI agents to defend against
[62:22] the other AI agents I'm like okay
[62:26] okay that's convenient for you to say
[62:29] but the reality of what Bob Bernett is
[62:32] talking about um with this uh you know
[62:35] Randomness engine um from Barefoot
[62:38] mining the the innovation of Bitcoin is
[62:41] digital costliness right there has to be
[62:44] a cost to create and maintain a digital
[62:49] record of what happened in the past and
[62:51] if there isn't a cost then we're in a
[62:54] world full of hurt and trouble
[62:55] especially with deep fakes and AIS and
[62:57] everything else so I think it's
[62:59] incredibly important for Bitcoin to be
[63:02] this foundational layer now I believe
[63:05] that there's going to be other protocols
[63:07] on top of it you know um layer twos
[63:10] different things that peg in and out of
[63:11] Bitcoin that are not you know taking you
[63:14] know space from you know the menle or
[63:17] the blockchain itself or block space um
[63:21] but it's incredibly important there need
[63:22] to be people who are thinking about it
[63:25] um how do we actually have a verified
[63:27] record that you are who you say you are
[63:30] this is what you said and this is what
[63:32] happened on this date and time not
[63:34] verified by the winners and who get to
[63:36] rewrite history but verified by this non
[63:41] you know judgmental third-party
[63:44] objective protocol called Bitcoin super
[63:48] important really really cool I love love
[63:51] that view um thank you so much dant for
