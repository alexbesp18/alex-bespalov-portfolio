[00:00] what is the Bitcoin Farmers Market the
[00:02] Farmers Market has B an opportunity for
[00:04] anybody to partake in the circular
[00:06] economy that's happening in Bitcoin
[00:08] beach now more and more people coming
[00:09] there and asking for hey do you accept
[00:11] Bitcoin small business owners have to
[00:13] accept it at some point in the Sal
[00:15] There's Something Beautiful happening in
[00:16] the last 2 years Al salor has changed a
[00:18] lot in terms of security and the ability
[00:20] to move around how much safer is Al it's
[00:23] kind of tricky because we arrived
[00:24] literally like 2 months before the mass
[00:27] murder weekend
[00:28] happened what does it mean for you both
[00:31] to be free and especially because you're
[00:33] in El Salvador you're living on a kind
[00:35] of a Bitcoin standard I guess it's not a
[00:37] full Bitcoin standard but it's like the
[00:39] closest thing people are now experience
[00:42] on a Bitcoin standard so like how does
[00:44] this all come to together okay wow all
[00:47] right Freedom it's a great question and
[00:52] I guess um I don't really have a desire
[00:55] to control other people and when other
[00:58] people try to control me outside of any
[01:02] sort of
[01:03] arrangement uh that's definitely
[01:05] encroaching on my freedom yeah so I
[01:10] think in New Zealand that was probably
[01:13] starting to happen and so coming to our
[01:15] Sor we felt like it was an opportunity
[01:18] to
[01:20] start start a new life with something
[01:22] that we thought was interesting and
[01:23] Bitcoin is
[01:26] a a tool it's been I've been in Bitcoin
[01:30] for quite a while and it's it's also a
[01:32] philosophy for me now and the ability to
[01:35] be able to take control and
[01:37] responsibility of my financial wealth is
[01:42] really empowering it's really
[01:44] interesting I enjoy the challenge of it
[01:47] and I enjoy the freedom of it and I'm
[01:51] also going to put in there the the
[01:52] chains of being with a mortgage and
[01:57] having to work um so many hours a day
[02:01] and you needing to earn a certain income
[02:04] so you can actually survive in the
[02:07] western
[02:08] world was a big to me was not Freedom so
[02:12] to to be able to come here um no we
[02:15] don't own our home we do rent but we
[02:18] have a lot more freedom without having
[02:21] you those those restrictions on us yeah
[02:25] and I grew upad I grew up in a family
[02:28] small family business
[02:30] and that gave me a lot of freedom to do
[02:35] things the way I wanted to do them which
[02:37] I think was quite interesting because
[02:40] the few times that I did go into a more
[02:43] structured
[02:44] job it didn't sit well with me so uh
[02:48] becoming a contractor was something that
[02:50] worked really well for me because I
[02:52] could work more often than not when I
[02:55] wanted earn income and it also gave me
[02:57] the the earn building skills that could
[02:59] earn an income online gave me the
[03:01] freedom to start working wherever there
[03:03] was internet so once you start to get a
[03:06] taste for that freedom it's hard to give
[03:10] it up yeah and I can yeah and we can
[03:13] also sort of move it forward a little
[03:15] bit by being up here in Berlin in El
[03:18] Salvador the freedom to say to walk out
[03:21] of a shop because they don't accept
[03:24] Bitcoin knowing that we can go to
[03:26] another store that will accept Bitcoin
[03:28] as as a great fre fre for us to be able
[03:31] to do that and we can do that here which
[03:33] is amazing that's a it's a crazy Freedom
[03:36] like I always try it also with like I'm
[03:39] in Austria and the adoption is not
[03:42] closely as far as in El Salvador I guess
[03:44] I never was in El Salvador I have to do
[03:46] it it's on my to-do list for this year
[03:49] uh and I always try to ask people uh do
[03:53] you accept Bitcoin and the answers are
[03:57] in like nine of 10 cases uh no what is
[04:02] that why should we what like like
[04:05] something rejecting like in in one of 10
[04:09] cases it's like a slightly positive
[04:11] answer or maybe even okay yes how can we
[04:14] do it like but it's in in smaller stores
[04:17] in like familyowned stores like they are
[04:19] more accepting of new stuff I guess and
[04:22] the big chains sometimes don't even have
[04:24] the the uh possibility to do it how did
[04:28] you first discover um like Bitcoin for
[04:31] for you did you just cover it together
[04:34] or like did someone of you orange bu the
[04:36] other one how did this skill I think
[04:39] well I'll start with my story so H
[04:43] growing up in a family business one of
[04:44] the things that was really important was
[04:46] how money worked I mean I'm putting all
[04:47] this time and effort into earn this
[04:49] thing called money and it's like how
[04:50] does that work and I learned quite early
[04:53] on that we used something called fiat
[04:55] currency and once I learned what fiat
[04:57] currency was and that there was some
[04:58] dude just standing there helping himself
[05:00] to it I realized that I needed to figure
[05:03] out a solution to this so I actually
[05:04] went into gold and silver and I bought
[05:06] lots of gold and silver to back my my
[05:09] wealth but what I started realizing was
[05:12] that game was also manipulated and
[05:14] rigged and then I I basically I was very
[05:18] fortunate to be able to grow up with a
[05:19] computer and when so when the internet
[05:22] came along I'd already played with
[05:24] bulletin boards and modems and I was
[05:26] like wow the internet this is pretty
[05:27] cool I could have a server on the inter
[05:29] and access it from anywhere in the world
[05:31] and for me this concept was really cool
[05:33] so when I was introduced to
[05:35] bitcoin I quickly saw the power of a
[05:38] decentralized money and you put the time
[05:40] in the effort in and start asking
[05:41] questions I'd already played with
[05:42] cryptography I'd already started using
[05:44] pgp for signing emails and things like
[05:47] that so when I came across Bitcoin I
[05:50] understood a number of the technologies
[05:52] that were behind it including like money
[05:54] and the internet and it made a lot of
[05:57] sense to me when I started the into it
[06:01] so
[06:03] the the when I saw it I I wanted it to
[06:06] be what it is if you know what I mean I
[06:09] think a lot of people are skeptical of
[06:10] it and I mean I've definitely had my War
[06:13] Stories and and learning to handle it
[06:15] and buy it and sell it and do all these
[06:17] crazy things you do with it lose it and
[06:19] get up getting scams and over the years
[06:23] it's just become more and more
[06:26] empowering and that's because the
[06:28] technology become better and more
[06:30] accepted and more understood and there
[06:32] are more people involved which makes it
[06:33] easier it's really good that's yeah okay
[06:37] and then for me I'm very much a quite a
[06:39] newbie when it comes to um Bitcoin uh I
[06:43] met
[06:45] James the first conversation James and I
[06:47] had was I said what are you into and he
[06:49] said Bitcoin I said sweet I need to talk
[06:51] to you that was um partly because I come
[06:54] from the financial background in New
[06:56] Zealand with mortgages so I was helping
[06:58] people get into de de and though the
[07:01] company I worked for were very focused
[07:03] on helping them pay their debt off
[07:04] faster than what the normal Banks
[07:07] were but we were all having to be
[07:09] retrained so all the financial advisors
[07:11] in New Zealand were having to be
[07:13] retrained and the triple CFA laws were
[07:16] coming in and we were having to pretty
[07:19] much manually analyze Bank St statements
[07:23] um and see what people were spending
[07:25] money on and and through that even
[07:28] though it was their ver spend so um it
[07:31] was money that they didn't you know that
[07:33] was theirs to me was their money that
[07:35] they could spend what they liked that
[07:38] was getting accounted for if they were
[07:40] spending too much on takeaways if they
[07:41] were spending too much um
[07:44] on alcohol or you know there was just
[07:48] all these things that we're having to
[07:49] take into account and I was going this
[07:50] is none about business and so it wasn't
[07:52] sitting well with me and I was getting
[07:54] very frustrated and I had people coming
[07:56] wanting mortgages and they're having to
[07:58] pay this tax on this profit they were
[08:00] making in their crypto or Bitcoin and I
[08:01] was like going okay I know we're not
[08:04] going to accept that as a form of
[08:06] income but then yeah I was able to then
[08:09] talk to James and it was really good so
[08:12] that's how I got caught up in this
[08:14] wonderful Journey that we're on and this
[08:15] was back in New Zealand and now you
[08:19] moved I think like what did you say two
[08:21] years ago uh to
[08:23] Salvador and you now even mov to Berlin
[08:27] which was confusing for me in the
[08:30] beginning because berin like I I in in
[08:33] Austria that like in Germany the capital
[08:35] of of of Germany is called also Berlin
[08:38] and I was like why are those Bitcoin
[08:40] dudes now all talking about
[08:42] Berlin what's so special about Berlin it
[08:45] was kind of the moment when I uh first
[08:47] got into Bitcoin and I heard about
[08:49] Austrian economics and I I'm living in
[08:51] Austrian and I'm like the economics in
[08:53] Austria is not that great so what's why
[08:56] why are those bitcoiners all braising
[08:58] Austrian economics then then I learned
[09:01] it's like Austrian School of Economics
[09:04] the haek and all those others and what
[09:07] the current current Financial system of
[09:10] AA um and it's also I think it goes into
[09:15] the question um how like if you're in
[09:19] Salvador you're spending Bitcoin you're
[09:20] probably also spending US dollar I guess
[09:23] it's not fully you cannot live fully on
[09:26] bitcoin um but you probably spend all a
[09:29] lot of Bitcoin in Salvador there are no
[09:31] capital gains taxes in Austria Germany
[09:35] there in Europe America this story is
[09:38] just a different one with taxes and you
[09:40] have to declare it and stuff like that
[09:43] um how important for like the Bitcoin
[09:46] adoption do you think is it that we
[09:48] actually spend the Bitcoin get in
[09:50] circular economy and then exchange it
[09:53] and and build something not even not
[09:56] just holding it but actually using
[09:58] Bitcoin
[10:00] wow okay it's a great question I know
[10:02] it's a hot topic for a lot of people so
[10:05] we're big Advocates of uh what I would
[10:08] call earn save a percentage and spend
[10:12] and then
[10:14] repeat so we're encouraging people
[10:17] because it's possible and I know it's
[10:20] not perfect
[10:23] but if you are serious about adoption
[10:26] just buying and holding and using it as
[10:28] a store of Val especially in these early
[10:30] stages I mean the the cost for people in
[10:33] the western world it's doable to uh to
[10:36] earn it and save it and spend it on the
[10:39] lightning Network and pay the network
[10:40] fees but I I really do believe that if
[10:42] we're to see like if people really want
[10:45] Bitcoin to be a tool that helps improve
[10:50] the monetary system in the world
[10:52] then I feel like I need to live it so I
[10:55] want to use it as a cash system and when
[10:58] we came to our elor and we started doing
[11:01] lightning transactions it was just like
[11:03] who this is this is amazing and then
[11:07] after one year at the beach we couldn't
[11:09] get enough Bitcoin transactions
[11:11] lightning transactions it was just
[11:14] frustrating when we came to Berlin and
[11:16] they had 20 businesses on board the
[11:19] first time we came up and we went around
[11:20] and we were using it and it it was
[11:23] really really great we that was when we
[11:26] knew we had to come and be part of this
[11:28] and now we've got 90 plus businesses on
[11:31] the map using or accepting Bitcoin
[11:34] lightning
[11:35] and it's uh it's it works it works it
[11:40] really does
[11:42] and I think what's happening is we're
[11:45] seeing
[11:47] people who have always used the US
[11:49] dollar never been big technology people
[11:52] so I'm talking about the the local
[11:53] salador and business owners that have
[11:55] started accepting it uh and thankfully
[11:58] with skip skepticism which is good I
[12:00] think it's healthy to be skeptical and
[12:02] then over the last six or seven months
[12:05] that they've been involved they're the
[12:06] really early adopters we have seen their
[12:09] attitude shift we've seen their interest
[12:11] shift we've we've uh we've been able to
[12:14] build relationships with them as well
[12:16] but in that time while we've been doing
[12:17] that seeing how they see hope and the
[12:22] technology that's coming and the ability
[12:24] to uh use another form of money that uh
[12:29] once because they start asking different
[12:30] questions right in the beginning money
[12:33] is money and they don't worry about it
[12:34] but then they're like why are you
[12:35] interested in Bitcoin and when you start
[12:37] talking about why you're interested in
[12:39] Bitcoin and the freedom that it gives
[12:40] and the the global Network and how it it
[12:45] can change lives uh that's really cool
[12:47] and honestly we can't really communicate
[12:49] it as well as we would like to in
[12:51] Spanish with people when they speak to
[12:53] us but thankfully the we have Evelyn and
[12:56] herado and Charlie who and a few other
[12:59] people who have great Spanish and great
[13:01] English and great Bitcoin understanding
[13:03] and they're doing a great job of being
[13:04] able to fill these gaps and one of the
[13:07] things that we're just doing here is um
[13:10] we're demonstrating that there are
[13:11] people from around the world that want
[13:13] to be part of this and they're as
[13:15] excited as we are because it's it's
[13:17] bringing attention to the little town so
[13:20] um I don't know that I think that I'm
[13:23] trying to I'm trying to express how I
[13:25] feel like it's not just uh the
[13:27] importance of using
[13:29] um lightning for the sake of proving the
[13:33] technology but there are greater social
[13:35] implications on on doing this yeah I was
[13:39] going to say the it it helps for people
[13:42] to understand it that much faster I
[13:45] believe with using the lightning Network
[13:48] um you've got because you've got the
[13:50] tender the store holders who yeah don't
[13:53] really maybe not have been to school or
[13:55] done much schooling and then all of a
[13:57] sudden they when they light bulb clicks
[13:59] that they've got this peer-to-peer
[14:01] transfer of um value that it's and it's
[14:07] not related to The Well I'm going to say
[14:10] not related to the government but
[14:11] there's no in between person it's um
[14:15] amazing and then they start using it
[14:17] more so they're now using it and and
[14:19] buying products that they need to on
[14:21] sale or products for their Cafe from
[14:23] local other local tenders around so the
[14:26] the the Bitcoin is actually getting
[14:27] circulated around and there some some
[14:30] businesses are now paying their staff
[14:32] part of their wages in Bitcoin So you
[14:35] you're seeing this this growth and and
[14:38] and it's the fact that they they feel
[14:40] empowered the fact that it is it is
[14:42] their money and it's their their choice
[14:44] to be spending it here with no you know
[14:46] there's no intermediary person or thing
[14:49] which is awesome it's a it's a great
[14:52] thing that all day long like we spend a
[14:54] lot of time saying on on the internet
[14:57] saying on Twitter are saying on on
[14:59] YouTube on all the platforms or Bitcoin
[15:02] is also Med of exchange you use it you
[15:04] transfer it like circular economy but
[15:07] we're seeing a lot on the internet but
[15:09] it's actually happening in Salvador in
[15:12] the world like there are places where
[15:14] people exchanging Bitcoin and I think
[15:16] it's a beautiful thing and I also heard
[15:18] uh I think you were both writing it to
[15:20] me uh that Nikki you are making soap uh
[15:24] and also selling it on the Bitcoin
[15:27] Farmers Market like first of all it's an
[15:29] amazing things to make Bitcoin soap and
[15:33] get probably also Bitcoin back for it uh
[15:36] and uh what is the Bitcoin farmers
[15:38] market in in in general uh well James
[15:42] and Kiki from uh down in alante Canadian
[15:45] and Australian Canadian um they've been
[15:49] in um El Salvador nearly the same length
[15:52] of time of us and they've pretty much
[15:54] stayed in alante the whole time and
[15:57] about
[15:59] it wouldn't have been a year ago uh I'm
[16:01] not sure how n months roughly yeah they
[16:04] um came up with an idea to start um a a
[16:08] Bitcoin Farmers Market down there and
[16:10] what's happened is because people we had
[16:13] beef back better um producing you know
[16:16] grass-fed good grass-fed meat here for a
[16:19] lot of people who wanted that Kiki uh
[16:22] makes um amazing butter uh James is
[16:26] interested in in pork and bacon and H
[16:28] and and so we had all these people who
[16:31] were creating things that they wanted to
[16:34] sell uh for Bitcoin and they wanted to
[16:36] get a Bitcoin income and they created
[16:39] the Bitcoin Farmers Market which is
[16:41] every second Sunday and the vendors now
[16:43] we've got Salvador and vendors we've got
[16:45] foreigners and we're all like there's
[16:48] one thing I I was really missing good
[16:50] soap here uh we came from a town where
[16:54] we went to our satday morning market and
[16:56] were able to buy handmade soap
[16:59] so when Owen from beef back better had
[17:02] created um that was doing the beef and
[17:04] all of a sudden he had this Tallow great
[17:07] I'm going to learn how to make Tallow
[17:08] soap and so that's what I
[17:10] did and um and it's going really well
[17:13] it's amazing
[17:18] yeah well it's uh I think it's put a
[17:22] it's put a a heart and a soul more heart
[17:25] and soul into Bitcoin Beach so Bitcoin
[17:28] Beach uh is a very small community and
[17:31] the businesses there it's it's saturated
[17:35] the it's hard to get more businesses on
[17:37] board uh
[17:39] and the Farmers Market has bought an
[17:43] opportunity for anybody to partake in
[17:45] the circular economy that's happening in
[17:47] Bitcoin beach now so you can turn up as
[17:50] just a person who wants to buy a good
[17:52] coffee on Sunday morning and catch up
[17:54] with a whole heap of bitcoiners or you
[17:56] can make something or offer for a
[17:58] service and you can go there and set up
[18:00] a store at the moment for free and say
[18:03] hey I would like to help you with your
[18:06] Bitcoin stuff or I've made these bags or
[18:08] I've made these jams and I I would love
[18:11] to sell them for Bitcoin and so people
[18:14] can participate on such a small level
[18:16] now in the circular economy uh a lot of
[18:19] people come and they share knowledge and
[18:21] they share products and they help each
[18:23] other out and it's like a giant uh meet
[18:26] up on Sunday afternoon
[18:28] where people just come and have a great
[18:31] time it's built a sense of community and
[18:34] it's bringing together the Salvadorans
[18:36] and the foreigners because in the
[18:39] beginning a lot of people were worried
[18:40] that it was only going to be the
[18:41] foreigners that turned up but we came
[18:44] and we started when I say we it's like a
[18:47] general a general we in terms of
[18:49] foreigners came and uh started selling
[18:51] things that we wanted we we were filling
[18:53] a gap that we needed in the marketplace
[18:55] or wanted in the marketplace and then
[18:58] Salvadorans who are making really cool
[19:00] products here realized hey these guys
[19:03] are the these guys are potentially the
[19:06] the marketing the market Gap that I want
[19:09] to sell to and then they started turning
[19:11] up and we've had people we've had sador
[19:13] who are selling high quality fruits and
[19:14] vegetables come we've got one guy who
[19:16] comes from Santa Ana which is like two
[19:18] and a half hours away and he brings down
[19:20] organic vegetables sometimes we got
[19:22] ladies there who bring down homemade
[19:24] tinctures for skin care and smellies and
[19:27] it's really cool um people who make jams
[19:30] and pickles and local yeah local
[19:31] salvadorians who make jams and pickles
[19:34] uh yeah we got people who bring things
[19:36] them from America then sell them so yeah
[19:40] the coffee is a a Big Brand um toot Cafe
[19:45] um and he's there yeah um every second
[19:48] Sunday and you know yeah it's great
[19:51] networking a lot of people come and and
[19:53] just want to it's funny because we're
[19:55] committed to going every second Sunday a
[19:57] lot of people people will come hoping to
[19:59] see us there because they want to meet
[20:00] us and say hello and say thank you for
[20:02] the channel so it's it's become a Meetup
[20:06] effectively it's a really cool meet up
[20:07] and it's it's a three-hour drive for us
[20:09] so it's not it's not it's not close just
[20:11] down the road we drive three hours in
[20:13] the morning and then come home that
[20:15] afternoon or that evening so it's a big
[20:17] day it's worth it so every second Sunday
[20:20] it's a big uh day there interesting but
[20:23] the biggest Farms market um what like I
[20:26] think Bitcoin Beach everybody heard
[20:29] because of El Salvador and the origin
[20:31] story and with Jack maros like I think
[20:34] everybody heard it but what exactly for
[20:36] those don't know it like what is it uh
[20:39] is it like just a beach that
[20:42] is do for Bitcoin uh what do you mean
[20:46] it's saturated uh what exactly is
[20:48] Bitcoin Beach wow it's a I would I to
[20:53] describe it it's a small surf town which
[20:55] is that you got to you got to travel
[20:57] there it's not it's not connected to the
[20:59] city so you actually have to go out of
[21:00] your way it's about 45 minutes no it's
[21:03] more than that from the city an hour
[21:05] hour yeah an hour 15 an hour 20 from the
[21:08] city and I'm going to say not a a it's a
[21:11] little village or a seaside village yes
[21:14] it's a very small town but in the last
[21:17] few years I mean it's it's got an
[21:19] amazing reputation for surf so it's been
[21:23] over over the years before Bitcoin it
[21:25] was actually attracting a few big hotels
[21:27] which have set up there for the tourists
[21:29] that go specifically for the surf and a
[21:31] lot of those hotels are the ones that
[21:33] are already accepting Bitcoin because
[21:35] the foreigners are coming in and they're
[21:36] quite happy to accept it and then Mike
[21:40] the founder of Bitcoin Beach he's lived
[21:42] there for I don't know how long he's
[21:44] been oh well he's been coming for over
[21:46] 20 years and he's he's the one that
[21:49] basically received the donation because
[21:51] he was already part of a charity that
[21:53] was happening in Bitcoin
[21:55] Beach and he did decided to move the
[21:59] integration of Bitcoin into the
[22:01] community which is how it got its name
[22:05] Bitcoin Beach which is really cool uh if
[22:08] you go to visit today I would have to
[22:10] say it's changed a lot from just the
[22:12] last two years from when we when we when
[22:14] we first arrived when we first arrived
[22:16] we were shocked we were literally
[22:17] shocked we were like wow this is this is
[22:19] the famous Bitcoin Beach and now when
[22:21] you go it just gets B and B every time
[22:24] uh it's becoming more and more of an
[22:25] icon and uh it's
[22:29] um I think more small business owners
[22:31] are starting to realize that it's
[22:33] becoming part of the culture of the
[22:35] beach and it's a good idea to accept
[22:36] Bitcoin yeah because it's becoming an
[22:38] icon for it and to say no I think
[22:41] yeah I think it's it's also popular
[22:44] around the world and if more and more
[22:46] people coming there and asking for hey
[22:48] do you accept Bitcoin uh people the
[22:50] small business owners have to accept it
[22:52] at some point it's like a Grassroots
[22:54] movement that slowly gets in the whole
[22:58] uh ecosystem and that's that's amazing
[23:00] thing I have two more questions maybe
[23:02] interesting for people that are
[23:04] considering also to like move to El
[23:06] Salvador um how accepted is English in
[23:10] El Salvador is it like uh can you speak
[23:13] with everybody in English or like do you
[23:15] or do you have to learn their language I
[23:18] mean Google Translate is is your friend
[23:21] definitely um you do yeah uh ideally um
[23:24] to be able to speak a little bit of
[23:26] Spanish is is great coming you know down
[23:28] at the beach there are a lot of tourists
[23:30] uh so there is a lot of a lot more
[23:32] English down there yeah but even then
[23:34] there's you know um a lot of the small
[23:37] stor holders will not speak English uh
[23:40] coming up to the mountains nobody speaks
[23:42] English or very very very few so um down
[23:46] at the beach you're in quite often a
[23:47] negated Community where there's a lot of
[23:49] foreigners so you don't necessarily need
[23:50] to speak as much English as what you
[23:53] yeah yeah so we no not as much that you
[23:57] don't speak Spanish yeah uh moving to
[23:59] Berlin has actually been really good for
[24:01] our Spanish yes because we're we're
[24:03] we're integrated into the community here
[24:05] more and we had a I I would recommend
[24:08] putting time and effort into learning a
[24:10] base set of Spanish if somebody's coming
[24:12] so uh just asking basic things like
[24:14] where is or how much is um things like
[24:18] that and politeness this good morning
[24:20] yeah being polite General greetings
[24:22] introducing yourself where are you from
[24:24] and then once you get here uh those
[24:27] basic things can get you most most
[24:29] things like you want to eat and you want
[24:31] to know where to go where's the
[24:33] bathroom and thanks to like nck said
[24:36] Google translate you can fill in a lot
[24:37] of gaps uh but for us being here in the
[24:41] community is really forced forced which
[24:43] is which is great because I mean that's
[24:45] what we wanted uh we really wanted to be
[24:47] able to communicate in Spanish and yeah
[24:51] and so now on a daily basis we're having
[24:54] to speak Spanish uh which is awesome
[24:56] yeah I mean my Spanish has improved a
[24:59] lot it's still got a long long way to go
[25:01] but I'm getting there I'm super excited
[25:04] to announce that this podcast just got
[25:07] the first ever sponsor I just started
[25:10] the podcast out like three months ago
[25:13] and now we have 21 Bitcoin as a partner
[25:16] for this podcast 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin
[25:20] only from day one and they teach and
[25:23] preach self custody this is my Goto
[25:27] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[25:30] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[25:33] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[25:37] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[25:39] support this podcast use code Robin and
[25:43] click the link in the description for I
[25:46] think in the Sala There's Something
[25:48] Beautiful
[25:49] happening uh and I I get the why from a
[25:53] lot of people that are going there and
[25:56] also they are living there
[25:58] and I get the vibe from people that are
[26:00] not living there and not being there and
[26:03] I get a really different kind of mindset
[26:06] something like it's it's almost kind of
[26:08] something new something like a a startup
[26:11] land is starting uh something new and
[26:14] exciting something was that wasn't there
[26:17] before uh and is it just from the
[26:20] outside or is like the mindset of the
[26:22] people really different how is the
[26:24] different mindset and Vibe and the
[26:27] overall feeling uh different from like
[26:30] in Salvador to when you remembered
[26:33] earlier in New Zealand or maybe you you
[26:36] probably have been to other places also
[26:37] like maybe I don't know if you have to
[26:39] been to like say how different is it in
[26:41] Salvador I was saying this morning to
[26:43] Nikki that the last two years has
[26:45] actually felt like one big massive
[26:47] ongoing Meetup here
[26:51] in so we we had some some Canadians that
[26:55] visited that they they visit visited two
[26:57] years ago when we visited and they came
[26:59] back uh recently and they've come
[27:01] straight to Berlin it was just cool to
[27:03] hang out with them and and talk about
[27:04] things and similar experiences between
[27:06] when we both first arrived and what's
[27:08] changed and things like that and that
[27:11] that Meetup culture is it's always quite
[27:13] exciting to be constantly talking to new
[27:15] people and sharing similar experiences
[27:18] and things like that so there's that
[27:21] aspect of it and which we definitely
[27:23] feel after being here for two years but
[27:25] at the same time I definitely think
[27:28] there's a mindset shift here it it we
[27:31] call it the filter and to make a
[27:33] decision to come here and live in our
[27:35] salador is like it's serious like it's
[27:39] uh you got to you got to make some
[27:40] really big changes in your life and
[27:42] commitments if you want to do this and
[27:44] be willing
[27:45] to accept other cultures and accept
[27:48] different ways of life and things like
[27:51] that so it's it is a mindset shift and I
[27:54] think the people that stay in a
[27:56] resilient uh
[27:58] really interesting people to talk to
[28:00] because they've got they've often got a
[28:01] can do attitude which I think is
[28:04] important and then here in Berlin I feel
[28:06] like it's another filter on top of that
[28:08] because it's even less easy than San
[28:11] Salvador or the beach where you have
[28:13] convenience of services and convenience
[28:15] of uh English but then in the last two
[28:18] years our Salvador has changed a lot in
[28:20] terms of security and the ability to
[28:23] move around and I think it's changing
[28:25] for the for the while I mean I hope I
[28:27] heard people believe it's changing for
[28:28] the better yeah and I think one thing
[28:31] well even look at is the salvadorians
[28:33] that left our Salvador you know they or
[28:37] they escaped our Salvador when there was
[28:39] the gangs or whether it was a civil war
[28:41] you know they are now looking at our
[28:43] Salvador they're coming back they're
[28:44] investing in our Salvador you know
[28:47] there's people coming back to live here
[28:49] um and so for them to have the courage
[28:52] to come back to what they left is
[28:55] massive and and so they can see a shift
[28:59] they can feel so much safer so much more
[29:01] comfortable to come back to their home
[29:04] um and I think that's incredible yeah
[29:06] because that again that's a that's a
[29:08] mindset you're getting people who are
[29:11] are curious and they're adventurous and
[29:13] they want to do something right they
[29:15] want to come back and they want to help
[29:16] they want to help their family they want
[29:18] to help their countrymen uh we met a
[29:20] local developer here who's come back
[29:22] after learning and and learning a lot in
[29:24] the states and earning money and he
[29:27] understands how this how the the the
[29:30] development cycle of buying land and
[29:32] building businesses and building cash
[29:34] flow and taking out debt to do those
[29:36] things he understands it and he's come
[29:38] back and he's like I want to build
[29:39] businesses here specifically in Berlin
[29:42] that help the community that will grow
[29:44] the community and yeah it's a
[29:46] entrepreneurial mindset it's an
[29:48] adventurous Frontier mindset
[29:52] yeah that's amazing it just confirms
[29:56] what I get from other people it confirms
[29:59] like what I see uh online um so you were
[30:03] also in the last two years there when uh
[30:06] the big actions Against The Gangs uh
[30:10] were made uh how did you all see that
[30:14] because I think in in in Central Europe
[30:16] like if you look through the lens of
[30:18] mainstream media you get a different
[30:20] kind of of look to to things and I'm I'm
[30:24] I'm glad there is social media where you
[30:26] can get sources directly like you can
[30:29] connect with YouTu you can connect with
[30:31] everybody directly living also there and
[30:34] getting some unfiltered uh news directly
[30:37] from from people and not only that but
[30:40] uh how how was that going and I heard
[30:43] some crazy stories where a father said
[30:46] like I can now feel safe when my
[30:48] daughter is going out so like those are
[30:50] the kind of stories that are like uh
[30:53] really really great um how do you how do
[30:56] you lift uh through through the time of
[30:58] the last two years how how much safer is
[31:01] salvad yeah it's kind of tricky because
[31:03] we arrived literally like two months
[31:07] before that that that weekend the mass
[31:10] murder weekend
[31:12] happened so we we we were definitely
[31:15] cautious in those first two months but I
[31:17] mean we largely been fed what the mass
[31:20] media had been putting out there which
[31:21] was fear and our family was promoting
[31:23] fear and uh so we were cautious but but
[31:26] rightfully so right like um I think
[31:29] coming to a country like this we should
[31:31] have been cautious yeah but then as and
[31:35] it's it's really hard to know if it's
[31:37] because because the country is being
[31:40] safer or we're more comfortable with the
[31:42] country it's quite tricky but we've
[31:46] definitely we've definitely heard
[31:48] similar stories from people where they
[31:51] they that they're thankful for the
[31:53] freedom that they can now feel about
[31:55] going for a walk at night like walk
[31:57] their dogs at night yeah just even the
[31:59] kids been able to play outside uh that
[32:01] was one thing in L retired when we were
[32:03] down at the beach and we'd go to the
[32:05] macardos once a week and all of a sudden
[32:08] you know the kids were moving a lot more
[32:10] Freer than what they had been earlier on
[32:13] and they're
[32:14] definitely felt um and again this is um
[32:18] maybe it is because we were more used to
[32:20] the people but the people felt like
[32:22] there was a weight off their shoulders
[32:24] yeah we definitely feel like we've
[32:26] observed that with people and the way
[32:29] because in the beginning
[32:31] uh people people weren't meant to be
[32:34] able to move between different zones
[32:37] even in their own City if they were in a
[32:38] big enough City they couldn't move from
[32:40] one District to another without
[32:41] basically crossing a gang border and
[32:43] being shaken down and things like that
[32:45] and we hear stories of people who are
[32:47] like yeah I used to carry two cell
[32:48] phones one to give to the gang members
[32:50] and one to keep and it was just a normal
[32:53] way of life for them and that I'm sure
[32:56] we I I don't feel like I'm imagining it
[32:59] but I'm sure we're seeing um different
[33:01] behavior in for
[33:03] example public settings people appear to
[33:06] be quite comfortable more comfortable
[33:09] over the over the two years with things
[33:12] like just letting your children run
[33:13] around crazy in in the public setting
[33:16] right I I feel like even in the West A
[33:18] lot of people are quite um cautious and
[33:21] keeping their children close to them but
[33:23] here the the community feeling of safety
[33:25] seems to be quite strong because in the
[33:27] Square where we go most weekends to
[33:29] enjoy at least one meal with our
[33:31] friends your kids just all over the
[33:33] place
[33:34] and yeah it's amazing it's really cool
[33:37] and then when we you know when we first
[33:38] arrived we were in s alador for 10 days
[33:42] um and we would walk up to the
[33:44] supermarket and every single store had a
[33:47] a guard with a
[33:48] shotgun and the razor wire and was
[33:51] coming from New Zealand was so so sort
[33:54] of foreign for us that um you know it
[33:58] took us a long time to get used to that
[34:00] but now you walk that street and you
[34:02] would maybe see one or two but that
[34:04] would be all and it's normally something
[34:06] that like a money oriented business that
[34:09] has a guard with it opposed to in the
[34:11] past it used to be almost anything it
[34:14] was the supermarkets it was the malls it
[34:16] was yeah and you don't see that now it's
[34:18] reduced significantly yeah I mean that
[34:21] is an an amazing indicator for that it's
[34:24] how much safe it is because like
[34:27] individual stories are always beautiful
[34:28] to hear but it's it's always like it can
[34:31] be subjective but if you go through the
[34:33] streets and the guards in front of the
[34:35] stores just getting a less uh that's an
[34:38] objective measurement where you can just
[34:40] say oh it's it's getting safer the
[34:42] stores own like we don't need the guard
[34:44] anymore we don't need to give money to a
[34:47] guard we we can keep the money reinvest
[34:49] in the business because it's safe now
[34:51] here like that's an never heard that
[34:53] actually it's that's an amazing uh St
[34:57] istics if you so will to measure like
[35:00] kind of
[35:01] Freedom yeah and the pride that the
[35:04] owners have of their stores now like you
[35:06] never used to see a sign outside so you
[35:08] never knew where whether you're at the
[35:10] right place to go and buy something
[35:12] because you actually had to go through
[35:13] normally through a gate to get to the
[35:14] shop or yeah and so now they're actually
[35:17] advertising they're painting they you
[35:19] know they're taking pride in their
[35:20] property and they're painting them up
[35:21] and they're putting signage outside and
[35:24] things that yeah so you're seeing that
[35:26] as well which is really great yeah
[35:28] because a lot of businesses were hiding
[35:30] where they were so you had to basically
[35:32] search the business online so you knew
[35:36] where to and then you'd communicate with
[35:38] them and say I'd like to come and buy
[35:39] something and they'd say okay this is
[35:41] our address and you would go there and
[35:43] there was no signage and we had that in
[35:45] one of our videos when we're doing the
[35:46] coconut sign actually yeah we were
[35:48] trying to find the sign business and the
[35:50] sign business didn't have a sign on the
[35:52] street telling you where they were and
[35:55] we were busy going up and down the
[35:56] street knocking on doors trying to find
[35:58] this business and when we found them and
[36:00] bought the sign it was like you guys
[36:02] need a
[36:03] sign but this is this is changing now
[36:07] where a lot of businesses they can
[36:09] advertise because they're not worried
[36:11] about being extorted by a gang member
[36:13] who finds
[36:14] them that's I love it
[36:18] um for the adoption I think uh Bitcoin
[36:22] is getting more and more into bit in El
[36:24] Salvador I think it's uh
[36:27] becoming more and more a circular
[36:29] economy uh I would love to be there once
[36:32] I think in November with the Bitcoin
[36:34] conference might be there I hope I can I
[36:37] can do it and experience myself how the
[36:40] Bitcoin adoption is is growing because I
[36:41] get different kind of reports from
[36:43] different kind of people and how how
[36:47] well can you pay everywhere with Bitcoin
[36:49] I mean I mean how how what would you
[36:52] like say like what's the percentage of
[36:54] stores have it and stores don't have it
[36:56] is Bitcoin in some restaurants a unit of
[36:59] account are the burgers written in
[37:01] satosi or like how how is that the whole
[37:06] uh adoption going in El Salvador and in
[37:09] Berlin and elante in San Salvador like
[37:12] what's what's going on there okay it
[37:14] depends on where you go so F first I
[37:17] just noticed you said you were going to
[37:18] come in conference if when when when you
[37:20] come when you come at conference make
[37:23] sure to book time like an extra week
[37:25] before and after highly recommend it uh
[37:28] some of the things that I'd recommend
[37:29] doing is definitely going to San
[37:30] Salvador and while you're there go to
[37:32] the my first Bitcoin Meetup and if you
[37:34] can go to a my first Bitcoin graduation
[37:37] it's a great experience like that's this
[37:39] is a tour that you can't like buy you
[37:43] it's a great experience to do then when
[37:46] when you go down to bitcoin Beach make
[37:47] sure you time it to go to a farmer's
[37:49] market because that experience is
[37:50] excellent also the Bitcoin
[37:53] Beach um Meetup is very good and it's a
[37:56] similar weekend to the my first Bitcoin
[37:59] Meetup so you can generally get those
[38:01] two meetups in the same one and then
[38:03] make sure you put time in to come to
[38:04] Berlin and check out what's happening
[38:06] because with 90 plus businesses on the
[38:08] map right now the the lightning
[38:10] experience here is fantastic yeah now in
[38:13] terms of the percentage of adoption it's
[38:16] going to depend on where you go and your
[38:18] luck is going to depend
[38:20] on um all sorts of
[38:23] factors there's definitely towns that
[38:25] still have got very little yeah Bitcoin
[38:29] adoption and it's only because you know
[38:31] they haven't had an Evelyn H come in and
[38:34] do what Evelyn her have done here you
[38:37] know and I think that's it's um I mean
[38:39] what's been amazing is we have had
[38:42] people salvadorians coming from other
[38:45] towns and going we want to create this
[38:47] in our town yeah and so we will be
[38:49] seeing more of these adoptions come up
[38:53] um but it's it's not just having an
[38:56] Evelyn har though so for example one of
[38:58] the challenges that I think Bitcoin
[39:00] Beach may have had is there was existing
[39:02] tourist business and this makes it
[39:03] challenging so a great example was here
[39:07] 5 kilm down the road there's a town
[39:09] called alria This Town it it attracts
[39:12] all all the local tourists from usan and
[39:16] San Miguel up the mountain to enjoy the
[39:18] cool a and this town is smaller than
[39:20] Berlin but on the weekend that town has
[39:24] is buzzing there are so many people the
[39:26] square is literally filled with people
[39:29] in stores selling Trinkets and food it
[39:33] is crazy it's like a party every weekend
[39:35] Berlin hasn't had that and I think
[39:38] what's happened is that in in
[39:43] alria they are spoiled with so much
[39:45] business they have no need to accept
[39:47] Bitcoin they they are happy to accept
[39:49] the US dollar when we ask if they will
[39:51] accept Bitcoin they're not interested
[39:52] they don't even want to hear about it
[39:54] they don't want to download a wallet
[39:55] anything but here in Berlin these guys
[39:58] they want more business they need more
[40:00] business and Evelyn and herado said to
[40:02] them would you like more business and
[40:05] they're like I love more business how
[40:06] are you going to do it download the
[40:08] Bitcoin Beach wallet and start accepting
[40:10] uh sorry the blink wallet download the
[40:12] blink wallet and start accepting Bitcoin
[40:15] and sure enough the tourists started
[40:17] coming we're here we go the after the
[40:19] conference more tourists came and what's
[40:22] happening is the people in Berlin are
[40:24] like Wow all I have to do is start
[40:26] accepting Bitcoin and people will come
[40:28] spend new new money will come into the
[40:30] economy and be spent with me and once
[40:32] they see how simple that is we've
[40:34] literally got businesses here that took
[40:36] it upon themselves to download the
[40:37] wallet print out their own sign put it
[40:39] out the front and we were just blown
[40:41] away and of course the first thing we do
[40:43] is we're like I got to eat here right so
[40:46] we go and spend money with them so
[40:49] the some business some towns in El
[40:52] Salvador are spoiled with tourist
[40:54] numbers or they don't want to change
[40:56] their way of life and that's okay but
[40:58] there are other towns that have a dream
[41:00] and and they have desire and they have
[41:02] motivation and they're willing to try
[41:03] something new with an open mindset and I
[41:05] think the people of Berlin were was were
[41:07] inspired they they saw an opportunity to
[41:10] have a little bit more and they grabbed
[41:12] it and ran with it and it it's paying
[41:14] off or I believe it's paying off for
[41:16] them the lots of them are very happy
[41:17] with what's happening the growth it's
[41:21] almost like uh the towns that need more
[41:25] do it more likely it's almost like salv
[41:28] itself because it was a country that
[41:30] needed the freedom in Bitcoin more than
[41:33] other count and now it's on the on the
[41:36] Takeover side it's like a counter that
[41:38] really on is growing and is is is
[41:42] developing really really good as I can
[41:44] see you're really deep into like
[41:47] circular economy and you probably use
[41:50] Bitcoin on almost a daily basis
[41:54] um what what kind of setup do you have
[41:58] like uh what lightning wallets do you
[42:01] found uh most useful uh what tools tools
[42:05] do you use daily how's your Bitcoin
[42:07] setup going I mean it's I know that's
[42:11] always
[42:13] a difficult question because some people
[42:15] also especially when it goes on oh how
[42:18] to self cust and stuff like that people
[42:19] don't want to tell because it could tell
[42:22] how you self cust and give hackers and
[42:25] attackers and Tech Vector so like you
[42:27] don't have to give anything up from your
[42:30] privacy but like what can you recommend
[42:32] for daily use especially as a medium of
[42:34] exchange daily usage uh well the blink
[42:37] wallet is probably one of the fastest
[42:40] easiest wallets out there and it's
[42:44] available to everybody other than North
[42:46] Korea China and people in the United
[42:51] States uh and what's great about it it
[42:54] has the stable step
[42:56] um option sets option which for people
[43:00] just new to bitcoin I want you know
[43:03] quite often were wanting to hold it in a
[43:05] like a US dollar currency type what you
[43:08] call yeah store Value Store store value
[43:10] so uh that's awesome they've also now
[43:13] just recently done a um where they can
[43:15] connect to their bank account if they
[43:16] have a bank account so blink for us and
[43:20] for a lot of the local Merchants is is a
[43:23] really good daily use wallet yeah and I
[43:27] know it's third party hosted I know that
[43:29] rubs a lot of people the wrong way and
[43:31] we had a we had a conversation with
[43:33] somebody one evening where we were
[43:34] talking about the the process flow we go
[43:37] through with people here in our Salvador
[43:38] when we're onboarding them a business
[43:40] and if they have a Cho wallet which is a
[43:42] government hosted wallet or we try to
[43:45] get them to Blink as soon as possible
[43:46] and with blink is one of the first ones
[43:48] we promote and I was having a
[43:50] conversation with a person and they that
[43:52] they looked had this disgusted look on
[43:53] their face and they were like it's like
[43:56] you have to teach them self custody and
[43:58] the thing is is I'm like the papoa lady
[44:00] over there who's selling papusas for 50
[44:02] cents each and she is worried about
[44:04] feeding her family tonight self- custody
[44:07] is the last thing she is thinking about
[44:09] and is the last thing she has money to
[44:11] invest in so right now blink being a
[44:16] third party hosted wallet is providing I
[44:19] think I think the best service out there
[44:21] and I say that because I've I've I use
[44:24] as many of these wallets as I can on a
[44:26] regular basis and I've got solutions for
[44:28] people who have different sort of
[44:30] situations and setups and things like
[44:32] that but the got like we we have been
[44:35] lucky enough to have direct
[44:37] communication with the blink team when
[44:39] we find a problem they're on it like
[44:41] they solve it and they're all about
[44:43] usability they're all about
[44:44] functionality they're all about
[44:46] protecting people's funds all of their
[44:47] code is open source if we were if we
[44:50] were technically skilled enough and and
[44:51] had enough money we could spin up all of
[44:53] our own versions of the blank software
[44:56] and run it on our own servers and be
[44:59] completely Sovereign in effect by
[45:00] running our own node and then um using
[45:03] their wallet as our own because it's
[45:05] open source as our own wallet in the
[45:07] community but these guys I mean when
[45:10] you've got that sort of Integrity that
[45:12] you're like man all of our stuff's open
[45:14] source and we'll help you spin it up if
[45:15] you want to make these circular
[45:17] economies work I mean it's a certain
[45:20] level of respect that I can't ignore and
[45:24] so there are other tools as well um I
[45:27] don't want to just rant on about Blink
[45:28] but if you want to go self custody
[45:31] Phoenix wallet is a fantastic wallet uh
[45:33] their self- custody service is probably
[45:35] one of the easier and cost effective
[45:39] ways to operate on lightning and self-
[45:43] custody at the moment there are other
[45:44] tools out there which are rapidly
[45:46] developing which is awesome for the
[45:48] people from the United States we have a
[45:49] lot of people coming from United States
[45:51] and they're going you know they're
[45:52] coming with moon um Moon which we it's
[45:56] not as easy to use on the lightning
[45:58] platform and it's expensive and it's
[46:00] expensive so uh they're going what can
[46:02] we use cuz they can't of course get W
[46:03] associate they can't get blink so the
[46:06] coin we've been just playing around with
[46:08] the coin feature support is excellent
[46:10] and one of the reasons I recommend
[46:12] Phoenix as a self- custody wallet and I
[46:14] know there's security issues but that's
[46:16] you know there's no perfect solution
[46:18] right now but with with Phoenix if you
[46:23] uh it's one of the best feature support
[46:25] self- custody wallets out there it
[46:27] supports a lot of the the features that
[46:29] blink supports in terms of scanning
[46:32] static QR codes and all sorts of like
[46:34] logins and things like that it's great
[46:37] uh another tool that I've started
[46:39] playing with is the liquid Network as
[46:42] the fees have started to get quite high
[46:46] and then the aqua wallet in that toolkit
[46:49] is quite useful and the aqua wallet
[46:51] pulls together tools like the bolts
[46:54] exchange and side swap which allow you
[46:56] to basically move your Bitcoin in and
[46:59] out of the lightning Network the onchain
[47:01] network and in and out of Aqua which is
[47:03] quite interesting I think that that's a
[47:05] really interesting tool as well when you
[47:06] start looking at Samson Ma and what he's
[47:08] doing and he is looking at nation state
[47:11] adoption which I mean that's a
[47:14] completely another topic but he spent a
[47:17] lot of time here in El Salvador and
[47:19] actually promoting a lot of things that
[47:21] are happening here which is really I
[47:23] think really important because I I want
[47:24] more than one nation I want more than
[47:26] one circular economy I I would love
[47:27] people to come and learn about what's
[47:29] happening here and do more of these in
[47:32] our sador do more of these around the
[47:33] world and the opportunity to do that is
[47:37] the tools the tooling that's available
[47:38] is getting better and better every
[47:40] day hope that helped that was like some
[47:43] crazy stuff went down there yes uh like
[47:48] I don't use lightning that much I should
[47:50] use it more but uh I just don't have a
[47:53] lot of possibilities to spend it uh and
[47:56] it's also a taxable event in in in my
[47:59] case so it's it's it's it's it's it
[48:01] comes with a lot of uh difficulties but
[48:04] I try to use it I try to play around
[48:07] with just with my different kind of
[48:10] wallets and and sending it from that
[48:12] wallet to another wallet uh then it's
[48:15] not a technically not a taxable event
[48:17] because I own it and there there are
[48:20] good tools out there and and I agree
[48:22] that there's not a perfect solution and
[48:24] I think there there's a a lot of
[48:26] developing still going on and there's a
[48:28] lot of to come on the lightning Network
[48:32] um as you need money to spend and you
[48:35] probably spend only on on the lightning
[48:37] Network to avoid High fees um how is
[48:41] your Ratio or do you only have it on
[48:44] Lightning Network or how is the ratio
[48:45] between like the base layer where you
[48:48] probably save the money and then then
[48:50] you have lightning Network where you
[48:53] spend it like this is how I imagine it
[48:55] and how I would imagine doing it like I
[48:57] have
[48:59] a a type or percentage which I save on
[49:03] my base layer which I will not only
[49:06] touch if I actually need it or I have a
[49:08] big um big spend and then I also have
[49:12] the lightning Network which for is for
[49:14] daily spin how's your percentage what
[49:16] like how is your setup going on in that
[49:19] direction I love this question we work
[49:22] as remote uh our job is all remote so we
[49:27] can do it all over the Internet and uh
[49:29] so when I invoice I invoice people I
[49:33] give them I use a service called bit
[49:35] wage and basically what they do is I
[49:38] sign up with them they say hey here's a
[49:40] bank account and a number of different
[49:42] countries and then when I invoice for
[49:44] example people in the United States they
[49:45] get a United States bank account they
[49:48] pay the US Dollars into that bank
[49:50] account and they just use a reference
[49:52] code that I give
[49:53] them we get Bitcoin
[49:56] so we then get uh you can split it
[49:59] however you like so bit wage allow you
[50:00] to split those payments into different
[50:03] currencies or wallets or whatever so we
[50:06] then receive Bitcoin onchain and then
[50:09] from that onchain setup we basically
[50:11] manage out into savings and lightning
[50:14] and and things like that so we know what
[50:17] we spend each month um our living
[50:19] expenses are reasonably
[50:22] consistent so when that money comes in
[50:24] we take uh a chunk to we actually take
[50:27] it to liquid at the moment and then we
[50:29] leave it in liquid in an onchain type of
[50:31] environment and then we dribble it out
[50:33] to lightning as we need it with a much
[50:36] lower fee due to the high fees on chain
[50:38] at the moment so that that enables us to
[50:41] pull like two $200 to our lightning
[50:43] wallet to be able to spend for the week
[50:45] and that way we can go around the shops
[50:47] and buy the water or the food or the the
[50:49] gas that we need
[50:51] and get some cash out to be able to buy
[50:54] vegetables and things like that
[50:56] so it's it's a mix of tools right now
[50:58] and as far as I'm concerned there are a
[51:01] lot of people that spend a lot of money
[51:02] analyzing the share market trying to
[51:04] figure out which which stocks they
[51:06] should be buying or selling to try and
[51:07] preserve their wealth and that's what
[51:09] I'm doing right now we we are learning
[51:11] the tools that we need to be able to
[51:13] manage our our our wealth uh we don't
[51:16] feel like we need to be invested in the
[51:18] stock market because we're invested in a
[51:21] sound money or a hard money and so to
[51:24] learn the tools that help us keep our
[51:25] fees down protect our savings and be
[51:28] able to be as liquid as possible under
[51:31] multiple different situations that's
[51:33] where we're now spending our time
[51:34] instead of analyzing random tech
[51:36] companies and seeing which one might win
[51:38] or lose and there's so many uh companies
[51:41] that are there to support So as James
[51:44] mentioned we've got bit wage but we also
[51:45] have bit refill so for any of our
[51:48] household um Power bows utilities bills
[51:51] we can use but refill um and we pay that
[51:54] through Bitcoin um through lightning we
[51:56] will then pay um all our household bills
[51:59] through that which is great and then of
[52:02] course there's the ditto Banks card
[52:03] which is a Salvadorian MasterCard and we
[52:08] transfer Bitcoin into it we change it
[52:11] over to USD see and then we can um we
[52:15] can buy we can literally spend it on
[52:17] Fiat rails yeah it's an amazing
[52:19] tool so there's there's a tool set that
[52:23] we have that gives us like the ditto
[52:25] Banks card was a game changer for us in
[52:27] terms of being able to operate here uh
[52:29] when we get really stuck which happens
[52:31] occasionally a lot of the big chains
[52:33] here like Supermarket chains actually
[52:36] accept uh lightning natively so you can
[52:39] go in and do a lightning transaction
[52:40] with these with these companies and then
[52:43] when we go to a hardware store not all
[52:45] of them except Bitcoin we use our ditto
[52:47] Banks card we only transfer the money
[52:49] that we need to at the time so if we
[52:51] need $100 we'll put $100 of Bitcoin on
[52:53] there they charge us 1% but basically it
[52:56] then gives us access to the Fiat rails
[52:58] basically in the store live which is
[53:00] amazing like the access we have to the
[53:03] tolling right now is really
[53:05] cool amazing um I I I love to have this
[53:10] this talk with you because the it shows
[53:13] that where Bitcoin can be all over the
[53:17] world in the future in the near future I
[53:20] think in the long-term future we will
[53:22] see even more than it's now in Salvador
[53:25] all over the world but uh that's another
[53:27] topic we're having an end routine at the
[53:29] podcast where the previous guest asked
[53:32] the next guest the question uh and this
[53:36] question is actually an interesting one
[53:37] because you touched on it a little bit
[53:39] before and you said to it that it's
[53:42] opens up a whole another topic let's see
[53:44] if we're opening it up now uh which
[53:46] which country will adopt Bitcoin next do
[53:49] you think oh man what a what a
[53:52] question I guess the question is is is
[53:55] is it as a legal tender because uh I
[53:59] guess one of the things that's
[54:00] interesting at the moment is people are
[54:01] doing a soft adoption so you have
[54:03] Guatemala where Bitcoin lake is and uh
[54:06] Argentina which have allowed the
[54:09] citizens of the of that country or the
[54:12] people of that country to transact in
[54:15] Bitcoin they they're allowed to transact
[54:17] in foreign currencies and Bitcoin is a
[54:19] foreign currency so they're allowed to
[54:22] uh transact there which actually changes
[54:25] like it's kind of like a soft way to add
[54:27] legal tender to those countries so do do
[54:31] they count
[54:32] already and then where else would we
[54:35] go that's a great question I would say
[54:38] if I was to narrow it down there's a
[54:39] good chance it'll be another Latin
[54:41] American country they seem to be a
[54:44] really uh good place to be I think
[54:47] follow sson
[54:49] M yeah I would I'd be watching watching
[54:52] Samson Mel quite heavily um
[54:56] but I if I was to have to put a small
[54:59] bit on it I would say that it will
[55:02] actually be a town inside Argentina I
[55:05] think there's a good chance we will see
[55:07] a specific Town inside Argentina that
[55:09] decides to go on a Bitcoin uh basically
[55:12] a Bitcoin standard effectively and try
[55:14] and encourage it as a legal tender we're
[55:16] already seeing towns inside Argentina
[55:18] that are going to try and create your
[55:19] own Fiat currencies which I mean you're
[55:21] just perpetuating the problem but go I
[55:24] guess that go to show the understanding
[55:26] of people's um understanding of money so
[55:29] I'm going to say a town inside Argentina
[55:31] I guess so I guess that means
[55:34] Argentina Argentina is an interesting
[55:36] one with chav M I don't know like how it
[55:41] how it will play out with him it's it
[55:44] looks good but let's see what what he
[55:46] can do um where can people find you the
[55:49] best uh where can people reach out to to
[55:52] you and get in contact with you T would
