[00:00] there is no way other people are not
[00:01] going to buy this asset if you've held a
[00:02] cash reserve for a few years that has
[00:04] not been touched that indicates to you
[00:06] that you have a significant amount of
[00:07] cash dwindling in purchasing power that
[00:09] could have been used as a Bitcoin
[00:11] treasury if you've got a profitable
[00:12] business and you can make the decision
[00:14] then you can use Bitcoin in two ways on
[00:17] your balance sheet one as an intangible
[00:19] asset and as basically a store of value
[00:21] on your balance sheet as a treasury item
[00:23] and two you can take payment in Bitcoin
[00:25] as well takes away a lot of headaches
[00:27] but take a lot of time with lawyers and
[00:29] take a lot of time with accountants and
[00:30] take a lot of energy from you running
[00:32] your business and allows you to just
[00:34] focus on organically growing your
[00:36] business in the manner that you know
[00:37] best you don't have to over complicate
[00:39] the matter the realization that your
[00:40] money will be worth more in the future
[00:42] than it is today that solves a lot of
[00:45] society's issues and it solves attitudes
[00:47] and it solves a lot of mental health
[00:49] issues for people that is a tough
[00:51] question to end
[00:52] on how did you get in bit in Bitcoin and
[00:56] how was your personal story in Bitcoin
[00:59] uh my personal story in Bitcoin I mean
[01:02] I'm I'm sure like everybody if I if I
[01:04] was to tell the entire story it would be
[01:06] would be quite a quite a long tale um
[01:09] and I did cover it recently on on a
[01:11] podcast on on uh Once Bitten with priny
[01:15] so without going into too much detail um
[01:18] my story with Bitcoin starts when I
[01:22] suppose of course when you when you're
[01:24] growing up and you're kind of learning
[01:26] about money and you're building what
[01:27] your Ambitions are and I I I I grew up
[01:30] in um quite a what you would just call
[01:34] Normal area um and had pretty normal
[01:37] upbringing very fortunate with you know
[01:41] great parents and all that kind of thing
[01:42] and and I went to the closest school to
[01:44] my house um but as a as a youngster I
[01:48] was always absolutely certain I wanted
[01:50] to run my own
[01:51] business um when I was probably a young
[01:54] kid I assumed that business would be
[01:56] buying and selling secondhand cars which
[01:58] would have been my passion as a like
[02:00] looking at at cars and then as I've gone
[02:02] to University I've still not known what
[02:04] I wanted to do in life and changed
[02:07] courses because quantity surveying
[02:10] wasn't for me and did quite a generic
[02:12] Business course along with playing sport
[02:15] so as I've left University I had the the
[02:18] choice really between staying or or
[02:21] going into a graduate scheme that was
[02:23] here's your guaranteed salary it's going
[02:25] to be a good salary here's your career
[02:27] path for the next 20 30 40 years and
[02:31] it's going to be steady or to take the
[02:34] risky route of going into like a really
[02:37] high sort of sales environment so
[02:41] recruitment which is low basic salaries
[02:45] High commissions and a a tough sort of
[02:48] end of the recruitment Spectrum
[02:50] permanent placement head hunting which
[02:52] might for those who who aren't familiar
[02:55] with the industry if you place one
[02:57] person every month then you're doing
[03:00] well in that Marketplace if you place
[03:02] two you're doing very well so it's not
[03:03] like um a high volume of sales and
[03:05] obviously because you're placing people
[03:07] that person might change the mind at the
[03:09] last moment and decide that they're
[03:10] staying in the company that they wanted
[03:12] to that they're already working for so
[03:15] you'll you have a very sort of roller
[03:17] coaster up and down in the one month you
[03:20] feel like a hero and the next month you
[03:22] are the person who lost the only deal
[03:25] that you had going on and you've blanked
[03:27] and you are sort of on the receiving end
[03:30] of of the sort of changing room chat in
[03:33] the office um but I chose that industry
[03:37] with a very low basic salary and a high
[03:40] risk which are kind which kind of when
[03:42] you when you look back at becoming a
[03:44] Bitcoin there is a bit of a reflection
[03:45] on everybody in Bitcoin has been through
[03:48] that period where they've not really
[03:50] known um the certainty of the outcome
[03:54] but they've started to become a Bitcoin
[03:55] and they've accepted that there is a
[03:57] high chance of volatility and there's a
[03:59] high chance of R So within the first two
[04:03] years of my career in that the first
[04:06] year I would I became very good at it
[04:08] after the first six months I was
[04:10] probably an office with say 25 really
[04:13] experienced consultants and the end of
[04:16] that six months I was doing pretty well
[04:17] and I was just a very overconfident 22
[04:20] or 23 year old um and I had a client who
[04:26] was um living the kind of fear lifestyle
[04:30] that I eventually wanted to get to at
[04:32] some point and that client um invited me
[04:38] out to his Villa took us out in his
[04:40] yacht with his wife and his son and
[04:42] wanted me to join his business basically
[04:44] so I had a weekend with the client and
[04:46] he took took me out in his boat that was
[04:49] called if you can think of a feat
[04:51] equivalent um well it was a very fat
[04:54] name um spare change would be the
[04:57] closest I could could give you to the
[04:59] boat with without docking him but that
[05:01] kind of he he owned a plane he owned a
[05:04] boat he had a business that was turned
[05:05] over probably about 15 million and
[05:07] making a couple of million profit so at
[05:09] the end of my first year in
[05:11] work albeit I was on probably
[05:14] 13,000 pounds a year at the time and
[05:18] earning good bonuses if I got good deals
[05:20] in I was being exposed to people and my
[05:23] Cent base were people who were very
[05:26] successful business owners so I had a
[05:28] really quick window a time where my
[05:32] skill set became just speaking to people
[05:34] who own
[05:35] businesses understanding what their
[05:37] business is understanding their story
[05:40] understanding where they want to take
[05:40] the business in the future and then
[05:42] helping to basically find good people
[05:44] who would assist that business in doing
[05:46] that so I joined him for a while and got
[05:50] all the trappings that came with it
[05:52] which was a basic salary that actually
[05:54] allowed me to cover my rent over a month
[05:56] and have a bit of money to go to a pub
[05:58] and go on holiday and that sort of thing
[06:02] but he also to to to secure me on
[06:06] board kind of let me use his little
[06:09] speedboat if I was on holiday in Spain
[06:12] or um part of the offer he made to me
[06:15] was to because I was 22 at the time and
[06:18] I was I was pretty confident um in my
[06:22] conversations with clients but the
[06:24] reality was I was living in a really uh
[06:28] sort of student type flat with a mate
[06:32] and we were we were we were I think I
[06:35] said this on everyone we were kind of
[06:36] sneaking through the um turn Styles at
[06:39] the training station every morning and
[06:41] and saving as much money as we possibly
[06:42] could just to go out on a Thursday night
[06:43] and a Friday night so I've joined him to
[06:47] acquire businesses for him for 12 months
[06:49] I didn't really know what I was doing
[06:51] but we managed to get a couple and at
[06:53] the end of that 12 months I thought I'm
[06:55] not enjoying the Safety and Security of
[06:58] of having a better basic salary but no
[07:01] hope for the
[07:03] future as in is the big payday ever
[07:06] going to come no it's not you're
[07:07] guaranteed to earn this amount every
[07:09] month until you get an increase of 10%
[07:12] or you know 20% if you're lucky
[07:15] but every year you're you're going to
[07:18] get an incremental salary increase and
[07:20] your life might get slightly better and
[07:23] without really understanding at the time
[07:25] I probably had a bit of an intuition I
[07:27] think a lot of bitcoiners have that in
[07:29] inflation is kind of put out in two
[07:32] baskets by the media or your government
[07:35] and one is CPI if you want to buy really
[07:38] average items that don't really change
[07:40] your life such as tins and beans bread
[07:42] fuel um Necessities to live and the
[07:45] other area of assets are appreciating
[07:48] assets so I was seeing the appreciating
[07:51] assets kind of get away from me and I'm
[07:54] trying to save for a house I'm thinking
[07:56] well every year I'm saving up for this
[07:58] house this house has coming further and
[08:00] further away from me so I'm sort of in
[08:02] my personal life I'm filling a bucket
[08:04] that's leaking and I don't really know
[08:06] what to do with the money so I I I
[08:08] decided to set up my own business and I
[08:12] was
[08:12] probably 24 by this point so i' done one
[08:15] year in
[08:17] the high sort
[08:19] of uh highly risky industry of
[08:22] recruitment where you're either going to
[08:23] be really good at it and you're going to
[08:26] succeed or you're not going to be good
[08:27] and a lot of people leave the industry
[08:29] pretty early if if they just can't sort
[08:32] of take to bad environment and I'd done
[08:35] one year with a good basic salary in a
[08:37] pretty secure role and I knew what I
[08:39] wanted to do I wanted the risk and I
[08:41] enjoyed the stress and I decided right
[08:43] okay I I'll set up by myself I sat by
[08:46] myself in the kitchen and within the
[08:49] first 24 hours I'd landed a deal that
[08:51] was like a a mediumsized deal and I
[08:53] thought well if if I can if I can just
[08:57] call good people who I know want to
[08:58] leave their position and put them in
[09:00] touch with good business owners who I
[09:02] know will want to hire them and want
[09:04] want them in their business and earn
[09:06] from that then that fits my skill set so
[09:10] I set up that business and in my first
[09:13] year it was glorious it was just me
[09:16] working for it I had no overheads it was
[09:18] just you're in the kitchen you've got a
[09:20] laptop you're making phone calls and you
[09:24] know if you have success you have
[09:25] success but the zero responsibility or
[09:29] risk in
[09:30] that within say the first 12 months had
[09:34] a client give me an office um as part of
[09:37] a deal instead of paying for the
[09:40] placement and as as I started um gaining
[09:45] liabilities I I was very conscious that
[09:47] I did not want to take on I I had this
[09:50] sort of vision that I wouldn't take on
[09:52] any debt in the business I would keep
[09:55] the business free from any liabilities
[09:56] so contracts on company cars
[10:00] um rent for offices people's salaries so
[10:03] in say let's say the
[10:05] second half of that first 12 months I
[10:08] had friends working for me on commission
[10:10] only that were earning quite highly I
[10:12] had an office for free and I had no um
[10:16] if I wanted to stop on that day I could
[10:18] stop on that day and as as they as the
[10:21] person who given me the office lost
[10:23] their business and I had to purchase um
[10:27] a rental agreement if you like for an
[10:30] office for 12 months and then I had to
[10:32] take business seriously and I had to
[10:33] start employing
[10:35] people on full-time
[10:37] contracts as I moved into that territory
[10:40] where I had Financial commitments I was
[10:43] starting to become aware of
[10:45] Bitcoin and let's say in that second
[10:49] year of the business I'm not great with
[10:51] times I'm not great with dates but let's
[10:52] say around about that second year of the
[10:54] business I started becoming aware of
[10:57] Bitcoin and there was only two aspects
[10:58] of it that that I really understood and
[11:00] I was just trusting the person who told
[11:02] me about it that these were facts and
[11:04] that they couldn't change and them two
[11:06] aspects where there's only 21 million of
[11:08] them and nobody can take it off you
[11:11] unless let's switch word seed phrase for
[11:13] password because I was rudimental in my
[11:15] understand at this stage unless someone
[11:17] has your password they can't take it
[11:19] from you they can't send it and it will
[11:21] sit there and it is publicly visible I
[11:24] didn't know where to to
[11:26] actually um see it publicly visible and
[11:30] I didn't really understand how the seed
[11:31] phrases worked or or or the level of
[11:34] security that that actually provided
[11:36] you and I didn't really understand why
[11:39] there could only ever be 21 million of
[11:41] them I just took them three points and
[11:42] thought well this is interesting and I'm
[11:45] going to get some
[11:47] personally so that's where I started
[11:50] being interested in Bitcoin it took me a
[11:51] long time to really understood how to
[11:53] out to send it to Cold
[11:55] Storage um I'm terrified of actually
[11:58] sending it anywhere else after I've sent
[12:00] it to that one cold storage device I'm
[12:02] not really sure whether I'm ever going
[12:03] to be able to get it out of this device
[12:05] thinking that it's inside it when it's
[12:07] it's obviously not and it's at that
[12:08] rudimental stage of um um the seeds are
[12:11] being planted for being a bitcoiner at
[12:14] the exact same time but my business is
[12:16] starting to get liabilities for rent in
[12:18] 12 months time um employment contracts
[12:21] with multiple people where they on
[12:23] notice periods and it's starting to
[12:25] become a real
[12:26] business um and over let's say over them
[12:29] next few years the
[12:31] only
[12:33] um sort of thoughts on bitcoin I had
[12:36] were for myself but I didn't completely
[12:40] understand the gravity of of what I'd
[12:44] been exposed to and how it would change
[12:47] the world forever if you like and I
[12:50] firmly believe it will in the future
[12:52] even if it's not as obvious to to the
[12:54] majority of people right now
[12:56] today so
[12:59] you have the ups and downs with with
[13:01] with business and I'm in a volatile
[13:03] business industry where one month you
[13:04] having an unbelievable month it's the
[13:06] best month you've ever had in the next
[13:07] month it's difficult and all this kind
[13:10] of thing and I wanted to move the
[13:12] business from what was a town in the
[13:15] north of England to a city in the north
[13:17] of England that I knew we could find
[13:20] better Talent better level of graduates
[13:23] and have sort of
[13:25] a um the opportunity to grow that
[13:29] company more and grow that
[13:31] company longer term for the better of
[13:34] the staff who we had at the time now
[13:38] I as my kind of Bitcoin story is going
[13:42] throughout that I'm I'm having
[13:43] conversations with friends and I I
[13:45] didn't discover I didn't discover any
[13:47] good podcasts like this I didn't
[13:49] discover any good stories of people in
[13:50] Bitcoin I didn't know anyone in Bitcoin
[13:52] I genuinely felt a bit like an island
[13:56] and I was trying to have conversation
[13:57] with friends about it to test my fear is
[14:00] and they weren't really giving me uh
[14:02] particularly good responses to it but
[14:05] would if you like
[14:08] um trigger the further thoughts that you
[14:10] have so for example I'm I'm speaking to
[14:13] to friends about Bitcoin and I said to
[14:16] them I said look if if if
[14:19] every um single Millionaire on the
[14:21] planet wants to buy this asset this
[14:23] asset is going up in value and then I'm
[14:26] thinking if every person who's ever
[14:29] needing to leave a partner in the future
[14:33] and doesn't want to disclose what assets
[14:35] they have they're going to buy this
[14:37] hasset um and then you're thinking at
[14:40] The Wider extreme if you're a Russian
[14:42] oligarch and all of a sudden you want to
[14:44] move from Russia to the Caribbean or the
[14:47] Cayman Islands or somewhere in Europe
[14:50] they're going to want to buy this asset
[14:52] too so I starting to think there is no
[14:57] other rational expectation for this
[15:00] asset than it goes up in value when
[15:03] priced in fat money so that thoughts
[15:07] them thoughts are going on in my head
[15:08] alongside running the business but I've
[15:10] not really put the two and two together
[15:12] yet and I'm speaking to friends about it
[15:14] and they're kind of just saying shut up
[15:16] Scott like stop going on about Bitcoin
[15:19] and and I I've I've mentioned it before
[15:22] but I I look at my WhatsApp messages
[15:24] from back in back in those years and I
[15:26] think it was probably
[15:27] 2018 which may have been after the
[15:32] crash um from sort of
[15:35] 177,000 UK pounds down to 5,000 or
[15:39] whatever it might be and I'm still
[15:41] trying to get friends to get their head
[15:42] around this asset and and I said look
[15:46] for these reasons which I've just gone
[15:47] through there there is no way other
[15:49] people are not going to buy this asset
[15:51] so I'm I'm starting to think about um
[15:54] tax I me people who are moving to
[15:58] jurisdictions got low tax bases are
[16:00] going to buy this asset to move it there
[16:02] that's an obvious thing and I'm writing
[16:05] all this out on WhatsApp and I've still
[16:06] got the a message now and then I put at
[16:08] the end of it something else have also
[16:10] been thinking about guys and these are
[16:12] non- bitcoiners in a WhatsApp group who
[16:13] used to play rugby with us something
[16:15] that something else been thinking about
[16:16] is a a dog Airbnb where you can just
[16:22] like Airbnb but you're dogging with
[16:24] people who like dogs who've got good
[16:25] reviews and they can pay to look after
[16:26] your dog and the group the the first
[16:30] response on it was I really like your
[16:32] idea about dog airbnbs and I'm sat there
[16:34] thinking I can't believe what I've just
[16:35] said to them all and that's fair
[16:37] response to it so I starting to think
[16:39] maybe I'm mad or everybody else is mad
[16:42] but I hadn't found Bitcoin Twitter and I
[16:45] hadn't really realized how many of the
[16:46] people were thinking way further down
[16:48] the line than I was um so I got to a
[16:51] point with the business where I was
[16:53] moving the business into a city center
[16:55] and and getting into a new office and
[16:57] looking to really launch for grow of a
[16:59] business now in that same week where I'm
[17:04] moving into a new
[17:06] office my mindset
[17:08] is by the time I'm 30 years
[17:12] old I want to be financially secure for
[17:17] my future children I don't have any
[17:19] children I still don't have any children
[17:20] yet but my mindset was always I want to
[17:22] make sure I'm F financially secure for
[17:23] my future children my future wife who I
[17:26] also hadn't kind of uh met in the early
[17:29] years of having the business I had met
[17:31] at this point um but I want to make sure
[17:34] my family are financially secure forever
[17:40] and the only way as a business owner and
[17:43] even when I was leaving University I
[17:45] believed that was possible was buying
[17:48] assets that would increase in value that
[17:50] could provide me income as well which
[17:52] when everybody who owns a business or
[17:54] everybody who's earning money and saving
[17:57] money prior to bit bit coin everybody
[18:00] looked at property quite often
[18:03] residential property in the UK anyway
[18:05] and I'm I'm sure that probably resonates
[18:08] further a field and it was okay well if
[18:10] I buy if I slowly build up a portfolio
[18:13] of 10 houses and we're all worth 00,000
[18:16] and I'm earning £5,000 a year from each
[18:20] of them houses and eventually I will
[18:22] have a portfolio of 1 million pounds
[18:24] worth of houses and I'll have an income
[18:27] but requires very little
[18:29] um energy of 50,000 perum and if I can
[18:34] get to there by the time I'm 30 years
[18:35] old I will relax and I'll feel
[18:38] better now just before i' move business
[18:42] into a city center I'd probably had had
[18:44] an experience of buying one property and
[18:46] renting it out and it was absolutely
[18:47] horrific and it still is to this day
[18:50] tenants going in tenants coming out
[18:52] things going wrong and the taxes and
[18:55] Council taxes and people tenants not
[18:56] paying them and then me being left with
[18:58] the l abilities of them and the um
[19:01] energy not being paid for me being left
[19:03] with liability I just thought this is
[19:04] the ultimate headache but I've still got
[19:07] Bitcoin at the back of my mind I've
[19:08] still not put everything together and
[19:10] then I moved into the office in leads
[19:13] and literally within seven days the
[19:14] whole country just shut down for covid
[19:17] and I thought well there we go uh right
[19:20] I need to get this I need to I need to
[19:22] adapt quickly and make this a scalable
[19:24] business get everything in place because
[19:27] this is probably going to last a few
[19:28] months and then out the back of that
[19:31] we're going to have a platform that I
[19:32] can scale a business on that's secure
[19:34] for all the staff and for me and my
[19:37] future going forward but lasted longer
[19:40] than expected but when you knew it was
[19:42] going to last longer than expected was
[19:44] the moment I really sort of went right
[19:46] now I understand Bitcoin is is is is the
[19:51] future because the price had been down
[19:53] for quite a few years and I just
[19:55] couldn't
[19:56] understand the outcome of a bitcoin
[19:59] price being rational I think if it's
[20:01] just not rational or logical that this
[20:04] is the
[20:05] price and much the same as I I assume
[20:07] you probably
[20:10] um saw throughout all the other
[20:12] countries in Europe UK you saw it in the
[20:16] USA and you saw it all around the world
[20:18] you had prime ministers and presidents
[20:20] standing up in front of the entire
[20:21] country and saying don't worry we are
[20:25] going to print as much money as as is
[20:28] necessary to ensure that you can all
[20:29] stay at home that you can all pay your
[20:33] debts your
[20:34] mortgages um all pay for your cost of
[20:37] living as you now call
[20:39] it that's all fine we can print as much
[20:42] money as we need to to look after you
[20:44] all and it was that moment when he was
[20:47] saying that speech and the whole Pub was
[20:48] sort of celebrating that I was just
[20:51] thinking that's it they've just opened
[20:53] the box and gone uh it was all a myth um
[20:58] but
[20:59] hope hoping we don't notice that that
[21:01] money is is free to to produce for
[21:05] central banks governments and private
[21:07] Banks as well um especially when the
[21:10] government back all the loans from the
[21:12] private Banks so that was a moment where
[21:13] I thought this is bitcoin's
[21:15] moment and it is it is going to be far
[21:20] bigger far quicker than I had
[21:23] anticipated having watched the slow
[21:25] adoption happen from 2016 onwards I
[21:28] thought the ad option is just going to
[21:29] ramp up at this moment and it did but I
[21:35] I noticed yesterday Robin that you were
[21:36] very fortunate to have
[21:38] um have a conversation with Michael
[21:43] sailor
[21:44] and I went from seeing this happening to
[21:48] watching Michael sailor with I think it
[21:50] was Ross
[21:53] Stevens um have a conversation where
[21:55] Michael sailor was being orange pilled
[21:58] and I don't know how I found this
[21:59] conversation I must have been vuring on
[22:01] bitcoin Twitter because at the time in
[22:05] in lockdown you had more time on your
[22:06] hands I started looking at what people
[22:07] were saying on Twitter so I had a feel
[22:09] for what the what the sort
[22:11] of um Community was like on there and
[22:15] I'd seen this video that's going to go
[22:18] on YouTube and I watched it on YouTube
[22:19] and I remember just thinking wow have I
[22:22] had blinkers on for the last few years
[22:24] this is going to be the asset that every
[22:27] company in the world has as its treasury
[22:29] asset every nation state has it has as
[22:31] its treasury asset and you can now solve
[22:35] the uh stranded energy problems in
[22:39] Africa and Canada and wherever you want
[22:43] in the world if you've got a dam or if
[22:45] you've got a solar farm or if you've got
[22:48] a wind farm you can now monetize that
[22:50] energy and transfer that energy from
[22:52] Africa to um me if you wanted to if if
[22:56] if I if I sent you my QR code
[22:59] and I just thought wow my my my sort of
[23:03] mindset on it opened up and I just
[23:05] started go that's where I went into the
[23:07] rabbit hole and that's where I I started
[23:09] thinking the the adoption has started
[23:11] from ground up with
[23:13] people and that started out with people
[23:16] with
[23:17] a low trust in
[23:21] institutions and a high IQ quite
[23:24] often and it is filtered slowly down to
[23:27] people who trust them a little bit a
[23:29] little bit more and a little bit more
[23:30] but still have low trust and the the
[23:33] people it's going to hit are the people
[23:35] like yourself is going to adopt it and
[23:39] and there's plenty of people from all
[23:41] different walks of life who've started
[23:42] adopting it individually over these
[23:44] years up to
[23:45] 2020 maybe
[23:48] 2021 and now you're going to see
[23:50] companies start adopting it and when
[23:52] when sailor adopted it on his balance
[23:54] sheet I thought well this is going to be
[23:56] really easy for me to adopt on mine
[23:58] because I'm a I'm a a small to medium
[24:02] Enterprise as you would call it in the
[24:03] UK
[24:04] anme and my business turns
[24:07] over um probably a couple of million and
[24:11] makes a few hundred thousand and at the
[24:14] time in in Co it was obviously making
[24:16] very little and turning over very little
[24:18] um but I thought I know where the
[24:20] savings need to be now because I've
[24:24] tried to grow this business organically
[24:26] and for the last 5 years I've been
[24:27] saving a number in a cash Reserve Bank
[24:30] or a cash Reserve account and then
[24:32] watching the purchasing power of that
[24:34] number devalue every single year and now
[24:37] I get it that's all you need to do is
[24:39] put your reserve savings into Bitcoin so
[24:42] it was really easy for me to start doing
[24:43] it um I I just opened up an account
[24:47] under the business
[24:48] name um with an exchange that was
[24:51] trusted in a a Bitcoin only exchange
[24:54] coin
[24:55] Corner um registered a special purpose
[24:59] vehicle to to hoddle it for me because I
[25:03] worried that if it was on my main
[25:05] operating business that what you
[25:07] wouldn't that if they changed the
[25:09] regulations it would make it really
[25:11] difficult
[25:13] to um well it risked the staff that was
[25:17] my main concern is I've got to make sure
[25:19] this business is secure and making best
[25:20] decisions possible for everyone who
[25:22] works within this business who is going
[25:23] to grow this business and if I put it on
[25:26] the main operating businesses uh balance
[25:28] sheet and the government changed
[25:30] legislation and say that it's illegal to
[25:33] own Bitcoin on your balance sheet then
[25:35] I've caused a real issue for my business
[25:36] so I needed to make a special purpose
[25:38] vehicle a separate entity that held the
[25:40] Bitcoin and could always transfer the
[25:44] fee amount back to my main business if
[25:47] that needed to use it so it was it was
[25:52] that was my orange pill Journey really
[25:53] and and it was them sort of three key
[25:57] moments for but brought me around to
[25:59] just being completely and utterly fully
[26:01] obsessed with Bitcoin and seeing it as
[26:03] the um future for for all aspects of of
[26:07] people businesses nation states life in
[26:10] general and I think we might be a few
[26:12] years away from that but it's slowly
[26:15] slowly coming uh love lovely you
[26:19] definitely have the the answer length of
[26:21] Michael C
[26:24] really I'm I'm I I probably don't put it
[26:27] across as Co cently but I yeah but I I
[26:31] saw it as simple simple owner managed
[26:35] small businesses are the ones who can
[26:37] just adopt it
[26:39] tomorrow and benefit from it the most
[26:42] long
[26:43] term whether that's somebody who owns a
[26:45] pub a restaurant a
[26:47] bar a logistics firm or a service Le
[26:51] business like me where you've just got
[26:52] good people in an office all wanting to
[26:55] work on me out for clients and and uh
[26:58] build a business if you want to build
[27:00] that business and we want it to be here
[27:02] in 10 20 30 40 50 years and we we want
[27:05] to stay involved in it forever that we
[27:06] need an asset that's going to live
[27:07] forever on my balance
[27:09] sheet you mentioned the the fear that
[27:12] you had that Bitcoin might be outlawed
[27:16] that's why you made that second uh
[27:18] company um is is that fear still here
[27:21] because I'm asking because I had that
[27:23] fear also when I came in in 2020 uh and
[27:27] right now I kind of don't have it
[27:29] anymore it's it's for me it's like the
[27:31] the we're kind at this point where it's
[27:34] really hard to imagine now that it gets
[27:36] banned but there are some ways or some
[27:38] scenarios or situation where I'm like
[27:40] okay if this and this happens they might
[27:42] do it do are you still afraid that this
[27:45] could be the case um no no not um not I
[27:53] wouldn't say not at all but that would
[27:55] just be dependent on what jurisdiction
[27:57] you're living in suppose I think I live
[27:59] in in in
[28:01] W um in the
[28:03] UK I think they will try and stifle the
[28:07] on onramps which they have and I don't
[28:09] necessarily believe they're doing that
[28:11] because they're evil and they don't want
[28:12] people to purchase Bitcoin I think that
[28:14] the people who are doing that the
[28:15] regulatory bodies uh just have such a
[28:19] lack of understanding and awareness of
[28:20] what Bitcoin is that they believe
[28:23] they're doing the right thing by
[28:24] limiting the amount people can buy and
[28:27] making it different ult to fill in
[28:29] quizzes but like I've I've sat with
[28:31] members of Staff who wanted to buy
[28:32] Bitcoin and said I'll help you sort of
[28:34] get set up to to do it and looked at the
[28:36] questions are being asked and
[28:39] gone um I don't know we answer to that
[28:42] that's a ridiculous question it's worded
[28:44] in a ridiculous manner so I think we
[28:46] might try and slow people purchasing it
[28:49] but I don't think there's any risk of
[28:51] Regulation now um Outlaw in a business
[28:55] having it on my balance sheet and I was
[28:56] never worried about it being outlawed on
[28:58] the balance sheet I was worried about
[28:59] changes to how it is um accounted for so
[29:04] at the time I was accounting for it and
[29:05] I still I'm now as an intangible asset
[29:07] on my balance sheet and I was strictly
[29:10] instructing my accountants that I do not
[29:12] want that publicly wrote down as this is
[29:15] what the asset is just just put the
[29:18] value of the asset and then it's an
[29:20] intangible asset on there because in the
[29:21] future you do you really want like
[29:25] Bitcoin is personal would never disclose
[29:28] that they own Bitcoin on a public I mean
[29:31] most of them people like yourself are
[29:34] pretty brave Pioneers who kind of put
[29:37] their name by what they do but a lot of
[29:39] bitcoiners live under pseudonyms and
[29:43] value their
[29:44] privacy so given that it given that um a
[29:48] lot of information is is publicly
[29:51] available in the UK I wanted to make
[29:54] sure my accounting gave me the least
[29:56] sort of attack surface for the
[29:58] government moaning and saying right
[30:00] we're going to cuz what I what I'm what
[30:01] I kind of thought might happen is uh
[30:05] taxation of unrealized capital
[30:08] gains and we know in Bitcoin that no
[30:13] capital gain is necessarily going to be
[30:15] the same six months later as it is right
[30:17] now and that could quite easily turn
[30:18] into a capital loss
[30:21] so if you're looking at accounting
[30:23] period you're like I just I just want to
[30:25] get this set up and I just want this to
[30:27] be
[30:28] signed off and compliant with the
[30:32] accountants and with our regulations as
[30:35] they are now but I want to make sure I
[30:36] give some protection for if The
[30:38] Regulators decide to change the rules
[30:39] where I have some
[30:41] negotiation in it and if you're going to
[30:44] change the rules this business is a
[30:46] separate entity you're going to have to
[30:47] have a real conversation with me and I'm
[30:48] going to have to explain why this asset
[30:51] is an ethical asset to hold on your
[30:53] balance sheet in 2020 2021 I didn't know
[30:56] whether they would come round to the
[30:58] sort of realization is an ethical asset
[31:00] to hold on your balance sheet you didn't
[31:02] know what kind of um push back you were
[31:05] going to get but now this year I have it
[31:09] on my main operating business and I talk
[31:13] about it pretty openly with banks and
[31:17] whoever I need to don't mention it to
[31:19] clients and I don't talk about it often
[31:21] with staff um I certainly haven't sort
[31:24] of gone through the process of letting
[31:25] them know how the um treasur is being
[31:28] run there there's no need to with an
[31:30] owner managed SM me but um yeah I I see
[31:33] that as dissipated significantly and
[31:35] when ETS were launched it felt like I
[31:37] dissipated
[31:39] forever yeah I also feel like that and
[31:42] and the unrealized skains I don't know
[31:44] why this this discussion comes up up
[31:47] again because taxes on unrealized gains
[31:50] is the biggest BS that I ever heard it's
[31:52] like you still have all the risk uh in
[31:56] one year and the tax you and then next
[31:59] year crash like there there's no sense
[32:01] in that at all I mean taxes in general
[32:04] could be discussed but on unrealized
[32:06] games I don't see it at all and this is
[32:09] actually a question that I wrote down in
[32:10] in my
[32:11] preparation um do you think that it's
[32:14] dangerous what I personally do and and a
[32:17] lot of other bitcoiners in the in the in
[32:20] the sphere do that that they disclose
[32:24] their full name there with
[32:26] the everybody know that I'm in Austria I
[32:28] mean I they don't know exactly where I
[32:30] am but they know that I'm in Austria
[32:32] Austria is not that big so you probably
[32:34] can find me if you really want to uh is
[32:37] is that is that do you find that
[32:40] dangerous um no I I don't necessarily
[32:43] think it's dangerous um I think it
[32:47] increases risk slightly for the
[32:50] individual um I I I'm wearing a pair of
[32:53] Shades now but anybody who knows me
[32:56] would would recognize me and anybody who
[32:58] knows me would recognize the the story
[33:01] The only reason I am
[33:03] half sort of pseudo I'm using my real
[33:05] first name with you is because my
[33:08] Bitcoin just not my Bitcoin my business
[33:11] lives in an entirely different world to
[33:13] bitcoin we work
[33:16] with um we work with about probably six
[33:20] different Industries none of which are
[33:22] related to
[33:24] bitcoin the clients we don't speak
[33:28] I don't speak to my clients about
[33:30] Bitcoin my staff don't talk about
[33:32] Bitcoin in the office so for me what I
[33:35] don't want to do is distract from my
[33:38] day-to-day most important
[33:40] Focus so on my Twitter account I might
[33:44] say stuff that I would certainly not say
[33:47] in the
[33:48] office or to a client so I've got a sort
[33:52] of half docked um setup for myself but I
[33:56] I wouldn't have these ation with clients
[33:58] and when it comes
[34:00] to um speaking as a business owner you
[34:06] kind of have your hands tied behind your
[34:08] back and you you can't
[34:11] really
[34:13] disclose your ex the extremity of of how
[34:16] much change you see Bitcoin driving and
[34:19] and your opinions like as a as a as a
[34:23] business owner I've never talked about
[34:24] the subjects that you would talk about
[34:26] in the pub with your friend friends you
[34:29] know you don't get into your your
[34:30] thoughts on politics and you don't get
[34:32] into your thoughts on world affairs and
[34:35] you don't give your opinion as a
[34:36] business owner your your job is to to
[34:38] allow the brand to work with all of your
[34:41] clients and I always sort of say when
[34:43] you when you're training staff ear
[34:45] stages you
[34:47] leave if you took politics for example
[34:50] which is a subject that drives emotional
[34:53] reactions in people that are not always
[34:55] logical and not always rational
[34:58] if you put your
[35:00] opinion in relation to any political
[35:03] topic on your work social media platform
[35:07] the likeliness is you're going to gain a
[35:09] zero benefit from it you're going to
[35:11] have 50% of your potential clients
[35:14] decide they don't like you and you got
[35:16] 50% of your potential clients decide
[35:18] they do like you which means you've now
[35:20] just shrank your potential client base
[35:22] by
[35:23] 50% by mentioning that and or be we were
[35:28] saying about the safety of a regulatory
[35:29] environment yes I believe that has
[35:31] massively changed in ctfs and I believe
[35:33] this is changing as well right now but
[35:35] it may take a few more months and it it
[35:38] might take a few more brave people like
[35:41] um I can't remember the name of the
[35:43] scientific firm that has just announced
[35:45] with the the shareholder or the
[35:46] Chairman's name on there saying we've
[35:48] just bought $40 million dollars worth of
[35:51] bitcoin take a few more Pioneers like
[35:53] that to do it on the big scale for it to
[35:56] not divide opinion
[35:59] so I now I attend business networking
[36:03] events and I always have conversations
[36:05] about Bitcoin I always bring it around
[36:07] that whenever I meet business owners I
[36:08] always bring the conversation around to
[36:10] bitcoin but this is business owners who
[36:11] are not clients these are business
[36:13] owners who are friends or at
[36:15] functions and I'm getting a really
[36:18] strong feel that the conversation is
[36:20] never gets the reaction it used to get
[36:22] which is quite an
[36:25] emotional response
[36:28] so that's the only reason I don't have
[36:29] my name associated with my Twitter or my
[36:33] company name associated with my Twitter
[36:36] if I wanted to build a career and if I
[36:37] had the opportunity to go back in time
[36:40] to my mid 20s and I was building a
[36:41] career I would want that to build that
[36:43] career within Bitcoin and I would use my
[36:45] real name and I would be
[36:47] absolutely all over using you know my
[36:51] real name and and really sort of um not
[36:53] worrying about the effects of course you
[36:55] invite a little bit of risk but you
[36:57] invite risk in all aspects of life if
[36:59] you are listening to this podcast you
[37:01] might be wondering what is actually the
[37:03] setup look like of Robin or how can I
[37:05] improve my Bitcoin setup and there's two
[37:08] things you have to buy Bitcoin from the
[37:10] right source and you have to store
[37:11] Bitcoin the right way let's focus on the
[37:14] first thing how to buy Bitcoin it's
[37:16] simple have a Bitcoin only exchange
[37:19] don't deal with the shitcoin exchanges
[37:20] don't deal with an exchange that has an
[37:22] own token or something like that be on a
[37:25] Bitcoin only exchange I use 20 21
[37:27] Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is for me the best
[37:30] partner for that and now where do you
[37:33] store Bitcoin Bitcoin should be stored
[37:35] on a hardware wallet on a self custody
[37:38] solution where you yourself hold your
[37:41] keys and it should be a cold wallet so
[37:44] that's my Simple Solutions that's a
[37:47] bitbox you just put your Bitcoin on
[37:49] there back up your seed fres and you are
[37:52] better than 95% of all Bitcoin hodlers
[37:56] if you have more than a ,000 in Bitcoin
[37:58] it's an absolutely must have one last
[38:01] thing before we get back to the video
[38:03] I'm really passionate about meeting
[38:04] other bitcoiners and there's an amazing
[38:07] opportunity in middle of Europe in June
[38:10] the Bitcoin BR conference it's the best
[38:13] and biggest Bitcoin only conference in
[38:16] whole of Europe for all Americans please
[38:19] visit Europe and visit this place in
[38:21] June for all europees it's a must go
[38:24] anyways you're so close to the Bitcoin
[38:26] PR conference you basically have to come
[38:28] I will do interviews there and I would
[38:30] love to meet you all there use code
[38:33] Robin for all my sponsors to get
[38:36] discounts and use the links down in the
[38:38] description yeah that's that's exactly
[38:40] what what I'm trying to do is I had the
[38:43] decision actually in my head like I it
[38:44] was something that I thought
[38:46] intentionally about do I go all in in
[38:49] social media or do I completely leave it
[38:52] or maybe the Third Way was like just be
[38:54] ponic like there are a lot of accounts
[38:57] out there that not that well known but
[39:00] you don't know who's behind them uh and
[39:04] I wanted I was like I want to be in the
[39:07] Bitcoin Community as deep as possible so
[39:10] I have to go to physical events I have
[39:12] to be with my name in there I have to be
[39:15] with my presence in there if you have if
[39:16] you really want to be in the industry
[39:18] you have to be fully in there and
[39:21] there's famous example Bitcoin Gandalf
[39:24] uh he has like 70 followers he
[39:28] from completely anous to he's now Daniel
[39:32] uh and he will be on the show soon
[39:35] also amazing account yeah an amazing
[39:38] account and he's now going from that
[39:40] thing and I will release tomorrow an
[39:42] episode with with um run an offer of a
[39:47] thousand years of inflation and he also
[39:50] is saying like if you really want to
[39:51] drive Bitcoin adoption we have to be
[39:53] proud of it we have to go out with it
[39:55] and and and and
[39:57] uh hide as little as possible uh but
[40:00] keep in mind the risk of the personal
[40:02] life because everyone has his uh has his
[40:04] things and I totally understand how you
[40:07] do it and and um I think you're brave
[40:09] that you're even doing the half doxing
[40:12] because yeah you we can see see you kind
[40:15] of so if you meet if you meet me at an
[40:18] event and so I I kind of go on a on a um
[40:23] looked into each other's eyes
[40:26] basis if I've met someone at an event
[40:28] they'll know my full name they'll know
[40:30] where what my business is called I'll
[40:32] I'm happy to to share them and introduce
[40:34] them to you know um introduce him to or
[40:40] bring people I know into the
[40:42] conversation and and let them know a lot
[40:45] about me but on Twitter I I I kind of
[40:49] keep it as you just don't know who's
[40:50] looking at it um and it just gives you a
[40:53] bit more freedom to say whatever you
[40:54] want to say as well if you're half doxed
[40:59] absolutely and and by the way semla
[41:01] scientific I think is the company name
[41:03] sem scientific yeah yeah exactly um just
[41:07] to just to if someone wants to look it
[41:10] up they they now have a name um you also
[41:12] mentioned something uh earlier I
[41:15] remember uh you said something that
[41:17] Bitcoin will change the world and you
[41:18] truly believe that Bitcoin will actually
[41:21] uh change a lot of the the fundamentals
[41:23] of the word this is a question that
[41:25] comes up a lot in my podcasts and I talk
[41:27] a lot about guests with them because
[41:30] there there there's those two sides of
[41:32] the arguments the first argument is like
[41:33] oh Bitcoin is just money it doesn't
[41:35] change change the the person it's just a
[41:37] tool but then there's also this other
[41:40] argument where like Bitcoin changes your
[41:43] time preference therefore it changes
[41:45] your incentives and when we one one when
[41:49] we know one thing for sure show me the
[41:51] incentives of a person and I will show
[41:53] you what this person will do I think
[41:55] Charlie manga was the one that uh coined
[41:57] it or was popularizing that phrase um
[42:00] how do you see it like first of all like
[42:02] you believe that Bitcoin will change the
[42:04] word and and how will how will this
[42:06] change look
[42:07] like um yeah I think Charlie M said show
[42:10] show me the incentive and I'll show you
[42:11] the
[42:12] outcome um and at the moment the
[42:16] incentives are upside down from the the
[42:19] the top of the institutions right down
[42:22] to to the individual in a lot of
[42:25] cases um which provides outcomes and you
[42:27] can see society's kind of on a slow
[42:30] decline at the moment and that's a
[42:33] decline in happiness decline in mental
[42:36] health a decline in Hope a decline in
[42:38] ambition a decline in the actual
[42:40] resources that we or services that have
[42:43] been delivered for a lot of people by
[42:44] governments and there are exceptions but
[42:46] generally speaking I think in if you
[42:47] look at the US and you look at the UK
[42:49] that's the feel you get from everyone is
[42:51] is seeing a social decline um where I
[42:54] see it change the world I I can't
[42:56] predict
[42:58] when it will be complete or if it will
[43:01] ever be complete but if the reserve
[43:04] currency is a sound money the
[43:07] incentives are more
[43:11] ethical um the outcomes for society more
[43:15] positive and there's more transparent
[43:17] accountability for the people who are in
[43:20] power within a country and they'll have
[43:22] far less power because the the subjects
[43:25] if you like and the and the the
[43:27] inhabitants of that country will have
[43:28] more choice to leave or stay in that
[43:30] country they'll have more choice to work
[43:33] with a sound money that's that's Global
[43:35] that's 24/7 they'll have more choice to
[43:36] work for anybody around the world and be
[43:39] paid in a currency that they
[43:41] will um have more control
[43:45] over
[43:47] um I
[43:49] suppose declaring and entering the
[43:51] contract with the
[43:52] government where they are residing at
[43:55] the time so you know when get your
[43:57] smaller sort of um your smaller states
[44:01] that that provide incentives for people
[44:03] to go and live there in in low tax low
[44:06] tax low government intervention high
[44:08] security jurisdictions and it gives
[44:10] people more Choice that's a long way
[44:13] away and there are people far more
[44:15] qualified to than me to to to paint the
[44:18] picture of what that looks like and
[44:19] anything I'm sort of aware of or
[44:22] discussing has has come out of a book
[44:25] written by somebody else or come out of
[44:27] a podcast with somebody more qualified
[44:29] to to um paint the picture of that and I
[44:33] think when you listen to Jeff Boo and it
[44:35] he kind of puts it simply when he's
[44:37] saying right now and into the future if
[44:42] if
[44:43] you're the the main incentive driver the
[44:46] lower level individuals and companies is
[44:48] if you're pricing everything in fat the
[44:53] prices are going up forever and if
[44:55] you're pricing everything in Bitcoin the
[44:57] prices are coming down forever that's
[44:59] sort of the Bedrock of where the
[45:01] incentives change how it would change
[45:03] the world if you look at people if you
[45:04] look at
[45:06] individuals uh people I speak to and
[45:09] friends I have in the UK who are at that
[45:11] level where they're hardworking people
[45:14] who are on what used to be a reasonable
[45:17] income and we've got a wife and we've
[45:19] got kids you can
[45:22] see the the the people say mental health
[45:26] is issues uh more prevalent in this day
[45:28] and age you can see where there'll be
[45:32] exceptions to what I'm about to say and
[45:34] there
[45:35] are um individual circumstances in every
[45:38] single situation I understand that but
[45:41] if you're working away for a salary
[45:43] Monday to Friday from 8 o'clock in the
[45:45] morning till 6 o'clock in the evening
[45:47] and seeing your kids for a couple of
[45:48] hours in the evening and your partner
[45:51] for a couple of hours in the evening
[45:53] when watching TV and you've saved
[45:57] hard to to buy the house and that's a a
[46:01] 10% um 10% of the house is yours the
[46:04] rest is mortgage you can't see your life
[46:08] improving dramatically in five years
[46:10] time 10 years time or 20 years time you
[46:13] are naturally going to have a mindset
[46:14] that says to yourself the next 10 to 20
[46:17] years things are slowly getting worse
[46:19] for me and there is very little I can do
[46:22] to correct
[46:24] that so if you start at that area of
[46:26] Society where it's people who are
[46:28] employed who are hardworking and earning
[46:32] good salaries with a fat currency all
[46:35] the hope and all the ambition and all of
[46:38] the sort of future
[46:41] plans are are are opaque and impossible
[46:45] to see like
[46:48] um I think Michael describes it best
[46:51] when he says
[46:52] hope but if you're saving that 100 to 00
[46:57] £500 whatever you can save if you're
[46:59] saving that in a sound money that you
[47:02] whether it increases forever or whether
[47:04] it doesn't whether it increases at 5% a
[47:07] year forever or whether it increases at
[47:09] 20% or whether it shoots up to you know
[47:13] 500% gain over the next four years and
[47:15] then drops to it drops down so it was
[47:17] only you know it's it's it's it's lost
[47:20] 50% of that 500% gain or whatever it is
[47:24] as long as you have the
[47:25] hope and the understanding the
[47:27] realization that your money will be
[47:29] worth more in the future than it is
[47:31] today that solves a lot of society's
[47:33] issues and it solves
[47:35] attitudes and it solves a lot of mental
[47:38] health issues for people and I think
[47:41] once you solve the sound money savings
[47:45] device for every
[47:48] normal working employed ambitious person
[47:53] in every country and around the world
[47:55] you solve a lot of issues
[47:58] they become happier more motivated more
[48:02] ambitious they start seeing a future for
[48:04] their family and not worrying about
[48:06] having more kids and all that kind of
[48:08] thing and not worrying about what the
[48:09] state of the world will be in 10 or 20
[48:11] years because it doesn't matter because
[48:13] they've got sound money and they know
[48:14] that that can help them move protect the
[48:17] family and provide a good future for the
[48:19] family and that goes from if you're in
[48:21] the the poorest areas of the world to
[48:25] the sort of mid classes of the the First
[48:28] World countries wherever that is as long
[48:31] as you know that the money you have
[48:33] today is going to worth more in the
[48:35] future then it solves a lot of your sort
[48:39] of
[48:41] um issues that you might have today yeah
[48:45] and it's it's also fascinating because a
[48:47] lot of people say oh what what do people
[48:49] do that don't have money left over and I
[48:52] also saying even if you can just do with
[48:55] 10 EUR a month or like 50 years a month
[48:58] that's a start like start some you have
[49:01] you have have to get your your the foot
[49:03] in the door with with saving and getting
[49:05] this mindset I will save in Bitcoin in
[49:08] sound money a little bit and then I can
[49:11] accelerate and this gives you hope this
[49:13] gives you something to look forward to
[49:14] and this is uh this is something that
[49:16] will completely change society as I also
[49:19] think and we we probably have zero to no
[49:22] idea how this what affects do those does
[49:27] those changes have I always like to make
[49:30] this example of running on Sand versus
[49:33] running on a solid Street on the sand
[49:35] you can still run but it's a really
[49:37] little bit harder to run it's a little
[49:38] bit harder to get a get forward and you
[49:42] more inclin to just like Lay Your Beach
[49:44] Tow out and lay flat on the sand relax
[49:48] uh on a solid Street you just
[49:50] incentivized to uh run and and it's
[49:53] easier to run and it's it's nicer to run
[49:55] on but you you still have to run like
[49:57] you still have to put your proof of work
[49:59] in and and and do something and that's
[50:01] that's for me the the biggest reason
[50:03] that I wanted to add here yeah it's it's
[50:05] so stressful to to start to own Bitcoin
[50:07] and that that's I think a massive major
[50:09] barrier for people in in that situation
[50:11] where that you're talking about and I
[50:13] I've spoke to like I've been really
[50:16] fortunate in my career and personal life
[50:19] I I've known people from all different
[50:21] sort of walks of life and all different
[50:24] levels of success so spoke to people
[50:27] who've set up and built Banks I've spoke
[50:29] to chairman of banks I've spoke to
[50:32] really successful lawyers I've spoke to
[50:33] entrepreneurs who've made ridiculously
[50:36] obscene sort of profits from businesses
[50:39] and selling and exiting
[50:41] businesses friends who who who were
[50:43] really sort of successful sports stars
[50:47] and then I've my friends who I grew up
[50:50] with who were very similar to me and
[50:51] that you know they they're ambitious but
[50:54] we've all been we've all been up against
[50:56] it throughout our lives and you kind of
[51:00] feel like you're filling a a a bucket
[51:02] that's leaking at all times whether
[51:05] that's in your personal life or whether
[51:06] that's in your business life the sort of
[51:08] in business for me the more I was doing
[51:10] the more holes are in my bucket the more
[51:13] contracts were attached to it and the
[51:14] W's leaking out the more um sort of
[51:17] rents the more taxes it was getting the
[51:20] more you're just just trying to conserve
[51:22] energy in in a in or conserve water if
[51:25] you like in in a bucket with got
[51:27] increasing amount of holes in it and
[51:29] when you're saying about it doesn't
[51:31] matter what it is it's all relative if
[51:33] you're if you're certain that your life
[51:36] is going to be improved next year and a
[51:39] year after and a year after and you've
[51:40] got a goal to go for then you're in a
[51:43] much better mindset and a much healthier
[51:45] mindset for your kids and for your
[51:47] family and for everyone you spend time
[51:49] with um and I had I had a friend who had
[51:52] a kid um few years ago and to orange
[51:57] pill him and he just got it straight
[52:00] away and it is is in a
[52:05] um a Tradesman type
[52:08] role and he's all he's always been
[52:11] stressed about money as we all always
[52:13] are when you're on a when you're
[52:16] thinking about money in a f World
[52:17] everyone stressed about it and he got
[52:19] Bitcoin and he rang me up and he said
[52:21] like I've got it I understand it all he
[52:24] said it I don't think it's going to
[52:25] change my life cuz I I I don't have
[52:27] enough money to put into this that's
[52:29] going to necessarily change my life but
[52:30] what I've done straight away is I've set
[52:32] up an account and I'm putting 50 a month
[52:35] in for my kid and I'm just going to
[52:37] leave it there until he's 18 what do you
[52:39] think of that I was thinking 50s a month
[52:44] for S of 16 years into
[52:49] Bitcoin that's unbelievable idea whereas
[52:52] people used to sort of put it in premium
[52:55] bonds or whatever it might
[52:58] you to do that there's an math example
[53:01] that a guest recently brought up if you
[53:05] were to invest € 10 EUR the last 10
[53:08] years every week in Bitcoin uh this
[53:12] would be an investment of 5,000 a little
[53:15] bit over 5,000 but that would be now
[53:17] over 300,000 EUR just 10 per week that
[53:22] that that's less than the 50 uh pounds
[53:27] per per uh per month actually so yeah
[53:30] Small Things add up uh this is I mean
[53:33] the the main point here and you
[53:36] definitely should do it if you have the
[53:38] possibility I was say the difficulty of
[53:41] moving from that sort of fear savings
[53:44] vehicle and saving up to buy a property
[53:46] to rent out or whatever it might be to
[53:48] being in a Bitcoin savings vehicle is
[53:50] for I don't think there's any way to
[53:52] necessarily do it without going through
[53:55] to to to move from saving in the Leaky
[53:57] bucket to bitcoin you've got to go
[54:00] through a baptism of fire and if if if
[54:03] anybody saved in Bitcoin 10 did you say
[54:05] 10 euros a week or yes 10 10 EUR a week
[54:09] for 10 years they would have seen their
[54:11] net worth going up to 50,000 down to
[54:15] 30,000 up to 200,000 down to 880,000 up
[54:19] to 300,000 now over that period of time
[54:22] and not everyone can sleep through that
[54:24] kind of draw down and not everyone can
[54:26] stay relaxed through that kind of draw
[54:28] down so I'll beat in the future I'm
[54:30] saying yes it does allow the opportunity
[54:32] for Hope and you know um solving a lot
[54:36] of issues in the short term you do need
[54:38] to prepare people and you do need to
[54:40] kind of make them allocate to the same
[54:43] level that we understand and give them
[54:47] the separate expectations that this is
[54:50] going to be stressful but over the next
[54:52] four
[54:53] years you're going to be rewarding
[54:55] yourself
[54:56] mentally with well done you've managed
[54:59] to get through that first four
[55:01] years yeah it's also when when someone
[55:04] is like oh it's so unfair that the early
[55:06] Bitcoin do have so much money and I'm
[55:07] like no if you seen if you're nobody
[55:11] have no money but you uh bought like a
[55:13] thousand Bitcoins back uh back there uh
[55:16] then you saw your net worth like oh it
[55:18] was like 10 EUR 20 EUR that all of was
[55:21] thousand Euros thousand Bitcoins now
[55:23] like a huge amount like if you really
[55:26] hold it to that Bitcoin
[55:28] amount could sold at any point you could
[55:31] sold at 50,000 you could sold at 500,000
[55:34] but you still did not sell uh and a
[55:37] thousand Bitcoin what is it like uh so
[55:40] that's a lot a lot of yeah so you go
[55:45] through that cycle and like no you you
[55:47] earned that if you actually still
[55:49] holding that oh yeah amount of Bitcoin
[55:52] because you did not sell it for a nice
[55:54] car you did not sell it for a nice house
[55:57] you hold it on you hold it on to your
[55:59] lifestyle you uh remained humble that's
[56:03] why we always say St and uh stay humble
[56:06] uh and he crew a Bitcoin uh Stag and
[56:09] this this is uh something remarkable uh
[56:12] and uh everybody and there are not a lot
[56:14] of people that uh hold it through the
[56:16] last like 10 10 15 years uh but the the
[56:21] few that did uh like kudos to them like
[56:24] that's that's a major few that did are
[56:27] usually
[56:29] extremely uh intelligent people who who
[56:32] had so much foresight most people you
[56:35] meet who bought for Silk Road will
[56:37] openly say most people you meet that had
[56:39] loads sold it all and then started
[56:42] getting it a few years later which is
[56:44] similar you know I I had a small amount
[56:48] 2016 I watched it go up I thought I'd
[56:51] made it I watched it drop all the way
[56:52] down sold some on the way down just
[56:55] thinking people are not going going to
[56:56] get this for years and it's okay I can
[56:58] buy some back later and it was only like
[56:59] 2020 where people really CAU on to what
[57:01] it was long term but when you're on
[57:04] about um brings us back round to
[57:07] incentives that hodling
[57:10] mentality of going through that kind of
[57:13] stress which everyone would have to go
[57:15] through your incentives in life change
[57:17] so what I'm saying a Bitcoin standard
[57:19] brings about a better world it doesn't
[57:20] have to necessarily be right now for
[57:24] Reserve currency for that to happen it's
[57:26] just is it your personal Reserve
[57:29] currency because if it is it'll change
[57:31] your incentives and the more people
[57:34] understand Bitcoin the more they um sort
[57:38] of match up that allocation to
[57:40] conviction and understanding the more
[57:43] their incentives improve so when when I
[57:45] first started a business I remember
[57:47] thinking in my head I I'll know when
[57:49] I've made it when I've made it will be
[57:52] when I have a really nice house
[57:56] couple of really nice
[57:58] cars and because I've been given a sort
[58:01] of luckily got a pilot's license with
[58:03] that that job off and thought I would
[58:05] like to buy a plane I would like to buy
[58:07] a boat so I was I was researching in my
[58:10] early 20s like what's the cheapest plane
[58:12] on the planet you can buy it's was like
[58:14] 30 grand like oh so I know I need that
[58:18] for that and like what's a good speed
[58:20] boat worth 25 30 so okay I need that for
[58:23] that and then what's the cars I want
[58:25] okay okay so I'll need to save that for
[58:27] that and then what's a house going to be
[58:29] well that just depends on deposit and
[58:31] mortgage so I need to start buying
[58:32] houses now and and sort of working my
[58:34] way up towards the house I want and if I
[58:36] can get back my m 30 is my life's dream
[58:39] and then when you understand Bitcoin as
[58:41] you go through that Journey that baptism
[58:42] fire of stressing midu now what do I
[58:45] want in life time just more time with
[58:49] friends more time with family more time
[58:52] doing things that they
[58:54] enjoy um and other than
[58:58] time and
[59:00] family um and Safety and Security and
[59:04] just happiness there's not much more I
[59:08] I'm bothered about
[59:11] owning I I want to own my own time and
[59:15] I'm sure like let's I um it doesn't
[59:19] matter how advanced Bitcoin is and how
[59:22] how ethical they all become and how much
[59:24] they preach robing they will always it
[59:27] will always boil down in some manner to
[59:30] what is the value worth in comparison
[59:33] with the goods or until F has
[59:36] disappeared what is the value worth in
[59:37] comparison with the B fat so don't get
[59:40] me
[59:41] wrong if if a if if a number went up
[59:45] dramatically the time I spent on
[59:47] holidays would
[59:49] increase the standard of those holidays
[59:51] would increase I might even rent a boat
[59:53] for a few days on one or you know what I
[59:55] mean like and you might rent a nice car
[59:59] through your business or whatever it
[60:00] might be so you you might rent the
[60:02] assets that you you enjoy and I'm sure
[60:04] plenty of people will but the mindset is
[60:07] completely changed from point of view of
[60:08] of looking at material things like that
[60:10] and thinking how I want
[60:12] that I've probably got one material
[60:14] thing that has lasted from before
[60:16] Bitcoin and it's just a watch that I
[60:17] bought just for a special occasion and
[60:19] that's
[60:20] it I mean everything else is I'm not
[60:24] sold on my chairs don't take my
[60:30] I I heard that story a lot like Bitcoin
[60:33] has value their time more and more when
[60:36] when they get Bitcoin and they value
[60:38] less than material things and they have
[60:41] like first of all it's completely uh up
[60:44] to everybody what they are spending
[60:46] their time with and what they are
[60:48] spending their uh Bitcoin with um
[60:51] because sometimes I get this argument oh
[60:53] but I want to spend my Bitcoin on my go
[60:56] for it I don't care H but I choose to
[60:59] huddle them uh as long as I can and um
[61:03] there also an interesting topic that I
[61:05] talked I think a few podcasts ago uh
[61:08] with retirement and we kind of came to
[61:10] that conclusion that the the best form
[61:12] of retirement is finding something you
[61:16] love to do that gives you the income to
[61:19] pay the bills that that's like that's
[61:21] the best form of retirement and then you
[61:23] can on top of that stack uh so Tes uh
[61:27] where you can live off them for yeah
[61:29] like a year maybe 10 years maybe even 20
[61:31] years maybe even unlimited years because
[61:34] you have a a low cost of living and a
[61:37] high stack then you're basically free
[61:39] you can do whatever you want if you want
[61:40] to make a one year V vacation and travel
[61:43] the world do it because you have the
[61:45] means to do it and that's that's the
[61:46] ultimate goal uh I guess in in in life
[61:49] have having freedom to to travel
[61:52] wherever you want uh have the freedom
[61:54] spend time with the family you want want
[61:56] and have the freedom to to do whatever
[61:57] you you want and uh that's that's a way
[62:01] better dream than yeah I want the
[62:03] Bugatti in my garage and there's nothing
[62:05] wrong with a Bugatti in your garage no
[62:08] that's where the money will distribute
[62:09] accordingly based on how how much
[62:12] conviction someone's got oh definitely
[62:15] sell your Bitcoin to buy a Bugatti go
[62:18] ahead but no people going to become less
[62:21] and less impressed with that in the
[62:23] future which is a a nicer future
[62:26] CU you sit outside a nice restaurant now
[62:29] and not necessarily the most likable
[62:32] person would probably pull up in a
[62:33] Bugatti or
[62:35] Ferrari not necessarily the one you want
[62:37] to sit with at the bar and talk to but
[62:39] they want to be seen and bitcoiners just
[62:42] don't seem to have that showy
[62:44] like iny face new money mentality that
[62:48] that that new money's tended to show
[62:49] over the last 30 40 years um and they
[62:52] have more of what you would probably
[62:54] deem old money mentality who tend to
[62:56] drive old Volvos or Land Rover Defenders
[62:59] and and and value their time or Bitcoins
[63:03] like new old
[63:05] money you know it's going to last yeah
[63:09] definitely and and I have so many
[63:11] questions prepared that we just did not
[63:14] cover
[63:16] it's um one last uh question I have it's
[63:21] like a double question in one thing
[63:24] um as you adopted a Bitcoin standard you
[63:27] probably know some some pitfalls that
[63:29] you went through and and some some tips
[63:31] maybe for other people um what are the
[63:34] reasons why someone should uh adopt a
[63:38] Bitcoin standard or put some Bitcoin on
[63:39] the Bal balance sheet in their own
[63:42] company and are there like reasons when
[63:45] Bitcoin when company should not do that
[63:47] like for example for unprofitable
[63:48] company starting out like do you have
[63:51] some some some reasons why you should do
[63:53] it why you should not do it some some
[63:56] maybe even common mistakes that you see
[63:58] people doing with when they're adopting
[63:59] a Bitcoin standard yeah um yeah um what
[64:03] what would say is if if it's an
[64:04] unprofitable business and and it's
[64:06] always going to be an unprofitable
[64:08] business then fat fat world does allow
[64:11] you to continue in some respects on that
[64:13] but it's not a good idea and if if we
[64:16] start this conversation on basis because
[64:18] there are unprofitable businesses that
[64:19] are scaling and trying to have got a
[64:22] road map to become
[64:24] profitable um but let's just take for
[64:27] example any profitable business ideally
[64:31] it's owner managed or is two or three
[64:35] shareholders who can make this decision
[64:38] have this decision so um the types of
[64:41] business I would say you want to look at
[64:43] it can go from the small business if you
[64:45] own a shop or you own a bar or you own a
[64:48] hairdressers or you're selfemployed
[64:50] individual then is simply a case of
[64:52] using it as a savings vehicle
[64:55] and a savings vehicle that you can keep
[64:57] within your limited company structure
[64:59] and you can borrow against in future if
[65:01] you're a slightly larger business and
[65:02] you're a business that's got staff and
[65:04] got significant responsibilities long
[65:07] term then what you probably want
[65:10] to I wouldn't recommend anybody's
[65:12] specific allocation I think if you've
[65:15] held a cash reserve for a few years that
[65:17] has not been touched that indicates to
[65:19] you that you have a significant amount
[65:21] of cash dwindling in purchasing power
[65:23] that could have been used as Bitcoin
[65:26] Treasury and you could probably switch
[65:28] that over over a sort of right now I'd
[65:32] recommend a pretty quick period of time
[65:35] but I would usually always recommend
[65:36] just treating Bitcoin as you would
[65:38] personally which is DCA
[65:40] in um but fundamentally if you've got a
[65:43] profitable business and you can make the
[65:45] decision then you can use Bitcoin in two
[65:49] two ways on your balance sheet one as an
[65:52] intangible asset and as basically a
[65:55] store of value on your balance sheet as
[65:56] a treasury item and two you can take
[65:58] payment in Bitcoin as well and then you
[66:00] can do both you can have it in your p&l
[66:02] or you can have it as a treasury item
[66:04] the reasons I would say as a business
[66:06] owner that you would want to to look at
[66:08] Bitcoin is owning a business is very
[66:10] stressful and you've got a lot of EX
[66:12] you've got a lot of responsibility to
[66:13] make decisions on behalf of other people
[66:16] and in order to grow that business
[66:18] people want to see
[66:20] growth so you you might be looking at
[66:24] like let's say it's a profit business
[66:26] most people are looking to grow and
[66:27] either take on debt to grow the business
[66:29] to increase the value of the business or
[66:32] they're looking to uh release Equity to
[66:35] private Equity Firm to bring in cash and
[66:40] increase the value of that business by
[66:42] growing that business what Bitcoin
[66:43] allows you to do is not to worry about
[66:45] either of them two
[66:47] things so as long as your business is
[66:49] profitable it can
[66:51] stay it can
[66:53] stay um
[66:56] good forever and become more
[66:59] valuable so what it what it means you
[67:02] don't have to worry about you don't have
[67:04] to worry about acquiring competitors in
[67:06] a race to to find growth as fast as
[67:09] possible and stretching your personal
[67:12] resources and your business's resources
[67:14] because acquiring companies is a
[67:18] headache and takes your eye off your own
[67:21] business you don't have to what what you
[67:23] previously used to have to do is you
[67:25] have to look for a store of value long
[67:27] term for your business so you don't have
[67:28] to necessarily look at if if you're
[67:31] worried about buying commercial property
[67:32] so you own your own offices or you're
[67:35] looking at buying commercial property
[67:36] through your pension scheme so you own
[67:37] some kind of commercial property so that
[67:40] you can sort of store value and gain
[67:43] some kind of income and makes it make it
[67:45] tax efficient that applies to the UK I
[67:47] believe it applies to a few other
[67:48] countries as well um you don't have to
[67:51] look at purchasing property but you
[67:53] can't liquidate fast and you can't and
[67:57] also brings about
[67:59] liabilities um you don't have to worry
[68:02] as much about you know when all
[68:05] businesses go through through ups and
[68:08] downs sometimes when you're when you're
[68:10] in them Downs you might need um cash
[68:14] flow and and you might look at debt and
[68:18] Loans but what you don't need to do is
[68:20] worry as much about how your balance
[68:22] sheet looks if you've got a Bitcoin
[68:23] balance sheet
[68:26] because the solution to that is there
[68:28] are now companies who will allow you to
[68:30] borrow against your Bitcoin and I
[68:31] believe over over time and over the
[68:33] future them companies intend it to be
[68:36] better but it will eventually become
[68:38] better when it comes to interest rates
[68:40] when it comes to loan to value and when
[68:41] it comes to Mark to market for value for
[68:44] a margin call on that borrowing against
[68:46] your own
[68:47] Bitcoin so what it does is it takes a it
[68:51] takes away a lot of headaches but take a
[68:53] lot of time with lawyers and take a lot
[68:55] of time time with accountants and take a
[68:56] lot of energy from you running your
[68:58] business and allows you to just focus on
[69:01] organically growing your business in the
[69:04] manner that you knows best you don't
[69:06] have to over complicate the matter so
[69:08] that's why I would say putting it on the
[69:09] on the balance sheet of a business like
[69:11] that
[69:13] um and and there the UK I can speak for
[69:17] from supplier perspective I know only
[69:19] ever really
[69:21] mention I try to only mention supplies
[69:23] when I've met them face to face and had
[69:25] a convers with them because as everybody
[69:27] who's ever run a podcast knows Robin you
[69:28] are at the whim of taking sponsors and
[69:31] if something goes wrong with that
[69:32] sponsor in a few years everyone's on you
[69:34] about it um so I've used coin Corner in
[69:37] the UK um to to allow me to purchase on
[69:40] the balance sheet and to talk you
[69:42] through how to do that you would open an
[69:44] account with them with your limited
[69:46] business whether you're doing that for
[69:47] your main operating business or whether
[69:49] you set up a special purpose vehicle to
[69:50] do so and you get an e-money account
[69:53] that means that you you risk of de
[69:55] banking has minimized quite a lot with
[69:57] that so you can send money to that
[69:59] e-money account without your bank
[70:00] necessarily questioning where it's going
[70:02] because it's an account in your own
[70:04] business's name that's within the coin
[70:06] Corner sort of
[70:09] platform and you can you can change the
[70:11] payments to DCA and you can set up
[70:13] automatic payments to start stacking
[70:15] within coin Corner coin Corner Great
[70:18] Exchange but don't leave you Bitcoin on
[70:19] an exchange you want to be thinking
[70:21] about the next step of cold storage and
[70:24] security
[70:25] so if you're an owner managed business
[70:27] owner you you want to be
[70:29] thinking I mean I I don't mind sharing a
[70:32] little bit about how I would manage
[70:34] security as a recommendation it doesn't
[70:36] necessarily mean this is my way of doing
[70:38] it but you then want to look at a
[70:39] company like an on an unchain or one of
[70:42] the multisig storage firms I think
[70:44] there's one in the UK but I can't
[70:46] remember name it right now and I've not
[70:47] used it um so you want to look at
[70:50] multisig and then you want to start
[70:51] researching how best to secure your
[70:54] assets which may mean multiple Safety
[70:57] and Security boxes in multiple
[70:59] jurisdictions and you might you might
[71:01] want to be vetting and
[71:03] meeting the Senior Management who own
[71:06] them businesses to make sure that you
[71:08] know how they operate and how they've
[71:10] dealt with um issues in the past or
[71:13] whatever it might be you want to know
[71:14] how many years that safety deposit box
[71:16] has been there without anybody getting
[71:17] into into the building so you got the
[71:21] Practical aspect of buying it cting it
[71:23] in uh multi and if you've got multiple
[71:26] shareholders then you might want a
[71:28] multisig where multiple shareholders all
[71:30] have a key um and then you want to be
[71:32] having a conversation with your
[71:33] accountants as well and trying to
[71:34] educate your accountants on how to
[71:36] account for
[71:37] it because your accountants and your
[71:40] solicitors might not understand the
[71:43] asset so you you you're kind of coaching
[71:45] them into understanding where they're
[71:46] going to account for it on your balance
[71:49] sheet and that probably sounds quite
[71:52] simple and it it is very simple but but
[71:55] like I say stick to the same principles
[71:57] you would as a a a individual investor
[72:01] you want to make sure you've got a
[72:02] healthy cash balance and that you're not
[72:03] putting the business at risk from a cash
[72:05] flow perspective you want to make sure
[72:07] ideally you're DCA in and you're
[72:09] matching your investment to your
[72:12] conviction and your strategy so if
[72:13] you're at the early stages of
[72:15] understanding Bitcoin be at the early
[72:17] stages of
[72:18] allocating because there is nothing more
[72:21] guaranteed than someone making a large
[72:23] size will purchase a Bitcoin in a price
[72:25] dropping in the next five minutes after
[72:27] we've done so that is a guaranteed
[72:29] Bitcoin law um so that that's that's
[72:32] putting on the balance sheet and the
[72:35] things you can do with that such as
[72:36] borrow against it just giving you a bit
[72:38] more
[72:39] freedom um you can also do things
[72:41] against it so if if you were let's say
[72:45] um you were looking to exit your
[72:46] business in in however many years or you
[72:48] want to stay in it I know personally I
[72:50] see myself being in my business
[72:52] forever um but I o see the staff being
[72:56] able to take shares in the business and
[73:00] the people who've built the business
[73:01] being able to take more of a control
[73:03] sort of have more control and more
[73:04] shares in business over the long term as
[73:06] I become more of
[73:08] a um hands off business owner what what
[73:13] having a Bitcoin balance sheet and
[73:14] having that kind of ass on there allows
[73:16] you to do is is effectively either Exit
[73:19] your business or allow a management
[73:21] buyout or something along their lines to
[73:23] happen and use for Bitcoin as a
[73:25] transferring species so you can you can
[73:29] realize um the sale value from The
[73:31] Business Without necessarily having to
[73:33] have saved it up in commercial property
[73:36] or other assets that are just difficult
[73:39] to hold difficult to liquidate and
[73:40] difficult to manage I I could I couldn't
[73:43] I couldn't sell um you couldn't sell 5%
[73:47] of a commercial property in 10 minutes
[73:50] if you needed to as a business owner and
[73:52] you couldn't borrow against it either
[73:53] but that tends to be the roote go down
[73:55] when it comes to adding long-term stores
[73:57] of value to the balance sheets so that's
[74:01] why I would say add it to the balance
[74:02] sheet Robin hope that covers the balance
[74:03] sheet aspect but if you want to take
[74:05] payment in it companies in the UK I
[74:08] don't know further field but musk it
[74:11] with the payment terminals at the
[74:12] opposite end of the spectrum you've got
[74:14] small bars restaurants all that kind of
[74:16] stuff if they want to take payment in
[74:18] Bitcoin and get used to it then then
[74:20] you've got companies like musket who
[74:23] allow you to do lightning payments
[74:25] immediately and the businesses can get
[74:27] used to to using Bitcoin and and I think
[74:30] to to sort of summarize and and wrap the
[74:33] business side of it up the more people
[74:35] like yourself and the more we all orange
[74:38] pill people and we
[74:40] bring your friends family relatives or
[74:43] businesses you come into contact with
[74:45] onto a Bitcoin standard in their
[74:47] personal lives and their business lives
[74:50] the more leverage the Bitcoin Community
[74:52] will have to bring about the more
[74:53] positive future that we all want for the
[74:55] world so if everybody's
[74:58] transacting en lightning in every shop
[75:01] in your city the changes that we need
[75:04] from reg regulators and legislators when
[75:07] it comes to recognizing it as a cash
[75:10] equivalent on business's profit and loss
[75:12] and balance sheet so you're not getting
[75:13] taxed for capital gains when you're
[75:16] transacting in a bit in in Bitcoin we'll
[75:19] all come about far quicker the more the
[75:21] adoption increases and especially from
[75:24] business is accepting payment in Bitcoin
[75:27] which is why I'll be I don't plan to
[75:29] ever sell I do purchase in Bitcoin if a
[75:33] business allows it and I do ask
[75:34] everywhere I go pretty much do they
[75:37] accept it now and I do always tip in
[75:41] Bitcoin if you're in a bar or a
[75:43] restaurant it's easy to orange pill
[75:45] someone when they're being paid to
[75:46] listen to you side of a
[75:50] bar it's a it's a great strategy and I
[75:52] think this is the Grassroots movement
[75:54] that we all need that we just go into
[75:56] restaurants we go go in bars we go in
[75:58] electronic shops whatever it is and ask
[76:01] hey do you also accept Bitcoin and if
[76:03] they say no then yeah it's card or cash
[76:06] but just asking the question um is a is
[76:10] a big contribution because then they
[76:13] like oh someone wanted to pay with
[76:14] Bitcoin and maybe next week there are
[76:16] someone coming that who also asked that
[76:19] question and and then then it compounds
[76:22] and at some point there will be so many
[76:24] people asking that he will be like hm
[76:27] maybe I should accept Bitcoin or maybe
[76:29] there's someone from a provider coming
[76:32] like hey do you want to accept Bitcoin
[76:34] uh in in your shop I have a service for
[76:36] you like yeah yeah those things
[76:40] accumulate and at some point the shops
[76:42] will accept Bitcoin it's just a matter
[76:44] of time matter of adoption and we right
[76:47] now we are not in a in a at a big stage
[76:49] on it I think the number was like we
[76:52] need around 4% of the world population
[76:55] uh being intolerant intolerant about not
[76:59] paying in Bitcoin like they have
[77:03] Bitcoin that kind of a point then we we
[77:05] come to a a bigger scale adoption cross
[77:10] casm on the adoption and that on on that
[77:13] note that there are businesses in in in
[77:15] Britain bridge to bitcoin that that that
[77:18] pretty much I think voluntarily just
[77:20] helps businesses adopt a Bitcoin
[77:23] standard usually I think they're they're
[77:26] quite often speaking to Merchants and
[77:28] small businesses and getting them on
[77:30] board um they're doing great work as
[77:33] well and and I think I should should
[77:35] rightly mention them alongside the likes
[77:37] some musket um and and when you're
[77:40] saying about people asking about Bitcoin
[77:44] payments um I was in a bar with a
[77:47] bitcoiner recently was saying why don't
[77:49] we ask other people to just randomly
[77:51] start asking behind this bar do we
[77:53] accept Bitcoin and just like
[77:55] even if they don't understand Bitcoin
[77:57] just go when you're at the bar just ask
[77:58] if you accept Bitcoin just to get the
[78:00] conversation happening
[78:02] more that that's what uh Red Bull uh the
[78:06] Austrian company actually did in the
[78:07] beginning when they started off they
[78:09] paid people uh to ask for Red Bull do
[78:12] you serve Red Bull yeah so that that was
[78:16] an amazing marketing strategy they just
[78:18] like send a bunch of people like the
[78:19] weeks before in the hey do you have Bill
[78:22] Red Bull Red Bull Red Bull and then
[78:24] after a month the Red Bull salesperson
[78:26] came in and like hey do you want to
[78:28] accept Red Bull in in
[78:30] your you might be on to something there
[78:32] Robin that might be uh that might be a
[78:35] pretty good
[78:36] idea we we we need an organized group
[78:39] that just like goes to all the rest for
[78:42] Bitcoin yeah yeah yeah perfect and yeah
[78:46] uh we before we come to the endro I have
[78:48] one last question that I ask all my my
[78:50] guests um because I think bitcoiners are
[78:53] extremely interesting people and I want
[78:55] to get to know them better um what are
[78:58] you currently passionate about besides
[79:01] Bitcoin like what besides Bitcoin is
[79:03] there any topic or activity that you're
[79:06] really passion about wow that is a that
[79:08] is a tough question to end on um is
[79:11] there anything I'm passionate about
[79:13] outside of Bitcoin it dominates my
[79:15] mindset quite a lot of the time the the
[79:17] the I'm passion about is obviously my
[79:20] business and the and the staff there but
[79:22] I'm I'm I'm trying to wonder
[79:26] um where the previous answers might have
[79:29] have gone there because everything comes
[79:33] back to Bitcoin in some manner or or or
[79:37] or in some way
[79:40] um you've got me what am I passionate
[79:43] about outside of Bitcoin I would
[79:46] say um there's nothing I am anywhere
[79:48] near as passionate about outside of
[79:50] Bitcoin other than obviously um
[79:54] my wife and uh my family and my friends
[79:58] and my time and I'm spending more time
[80:01] with my dog now in the morning because
[80:03] Bitcoin buys your time so I'm passionate
[80:05] about walking my dog I'm passionate
[80:07] about um using my leisure time to be
[80:12] happy and enjoy myself more but if I was
[80:16] to give you just what interest me but
[80:20] I'm technically not particularly minded
[80:22] I believe that AI is are pretty
[80:24] interesting topic to be looking into at
[80:26] the moment and I'm starting to read into
[80:31] and and and become passionate about
[80:33] understanding how that ties in with
[80:36] businesses and with open
[80:38] source um projects like in
[80:41] Nostra and and where that's going to go
[80:44] in the next 10 to 20 years but all of
[80:46] that ties back into AI is not going to
[80:49] take micro payments from another AI
[80:50] unless it's sell money because AI is
[80:52] going to be intelligent enough to know
[80:53] Bitcoin is the solution
[80:55] should
[80:57] absolutely yeah and it's an interesting
[81:00] question because there there are so many
[81:02] uh interesting answers coming up and and
[81:05] I I I I did it I think once in a podcast
[81:07] and I like the answer so much and I just
[81:09] keep going so like it's kind of my new
[81:11] end routine in the podcast but my actual
[81:13] end routine that I have since the first
[81:15] ever podcast and you my
[81:18] 137th podcast today
[81:21] um is is the previous guest is asking
[81:24] question for for the next guest and the
[81:26] question from the previous guest to you
[81:27] is uh do you think that Fiat Will
[81:30] Survive over the next 100 years and if
[81:34] so uh which one will be the biggest one
[81:37] I mean first off like that's an
[81:39] impossible to to answer question but
[81:40] it's it's interesting what you think
[81:42] about it I I I I my gut feeling is Fiat
[81:46] will still be here in 100
[81:49] years because quite a lot of be
[81:52] absolutely appalling
[81:55] currencies that have died in the last 20
[81:58] years are still here now and being
[82:02] inforced as legal tender even though
[82:04] they benefit nobody so I believe Fiat
[82:07] will still be here in a 100 years but I
[82:09] believe we'll have whittled it down to
[82:11] just a few that people will actually
[82:13] touch and which one do I think is going
[82:16] to be the one that that
[82:18] survives I'm not sure I could call that
[82:21] answer yet but I believe it'll be the
[82:22] first one to heavily back itself self
[82:26] with probably a combination of gold and
[82:28] Bitcoin cuz I don't think anyone will
[82:30] Rush any nation states will rush to back
[82:33] their currency with just Bitcoin because
[82:36] as soon as they do they open the
[82:39] floodgates for everybody understanding
[82:41] that this is a future and it doesn't
[82:43] matter if they back Their Fear With It
[82:44] people are just going to buy Bitcoin so
[82:46] I think they'll try and come up with a
[82:48] confusing way to back their currency
[82:51] with a variety of assets and they'll
[82:54] just slightly put Bitcoin in there and
[82:56] buy as much as he possibly can with a
[82:59] easy to print Fiat so I think the first
[83:02] one that does that'll be one that
[83:03] survives likely to be one that's that's
[83:05] around today and I think as much as you
[83:07] don't like to say I think US dollar is
[83:10] probably going to be
[83:11] the one that makes it out of all of them
[83:14] if any yeah US dollar is strong and even
[83:18] in the Bitcoin uh conversation they just
[83:21] further had than uh the than euris I
[83:25] watched the European election I watched
[83:26] the Austrian election there's not even a
[83:28] word of Bitcoin about crypto about
[83:31] anything like that and when you listen
[83:33] to Trump he's accepting Bitcoin he's
[83:36] talking about it even now I heard
[83:38] something with Biden that he's also now
[83:40] turning a little bit more crypto uh I
[83:43] heard some some something about that but
[83:44] I did not deeply research about that so
[83:48] you just have to like they are just a
[83:51] little bit further ahead again uh before
[83:53] the European Union I don't know about
[83:55] China how what they will do with Bitcoin
[83:57] obviously they try to get rid of it but
[83:59] obviously they failed until now since
[84:01] since 11 years it doesn't mean it
[84:03] doesn't mean that they're not stacking
[84:05] it um and and I think they will they
[84:09] will acquire a Bitcoin in SL roundabout
[84:11] ways so you look at the
[84:13] um the the confiscation is the way that
[84:17] nation states are securing Bitcoin at
[84:18] the moment I don't know whether the UK
[84:20] has the keys for the 61,000 that They
[84:23] confiscated
[84:24] um but obviously the US have the keys
[84:26] for the the Bitcoin They confiscated uh
[84:29] which is a Hot Topic at the moment but
[84:31] but Bitcoin is apolitical and they were
[84:33] all there's there's benefits to every
[84:37] single um subset of political opinions
[84:41] or social demographics Bitcoin benefits
[84:45] from all in some way so um all
[84:49] politicians will eventually have to come
[84:51] around to it um but yeah it's it's
[84:54] becoming a it's becoming a Hot
[84:56] Topic absolutely which is good to see
[84:59] the more people speak about it the more
[85:00] it comes up in normal conversation and
[85:03] the better it is for Bitcoin everything
[85:05] benefits Bitcoin in the long term
[85:07] perfect yeah totally totally agree with
[85:09] f um before I let you go before we can
[85:11] let you go um where can people find you
[85:14] where can people reach out to you ask
[85:16] you questions uh I'm on um
[85:20] x uh with the handle at Bitcoin only
[85:24] Scott which is BTC only
[85:27] Scott um so if you want to find me on
[85:30] there or ask me any questions or drop me
[85:32] a DM if you've got any questions then
