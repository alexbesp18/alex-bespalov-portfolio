[00:00] my allocation is 88% of my liquid net
[00:03] worth is in Bitcoin and I'm 66 you want
[00:05] to cancel me cancel me and that's why we
[00:07] need to do this work right now dude cuz
[00:09] we are going to be censored I think
[00:10] Bitcoin is an asset and I think real
[00:12] estate is a liability I would predict by
[00:14] December 31
[00:16] 2024 it's going to be extremely evident
[00:19] to everyone what the hell this whole
[00:21] Bitcoin thinks about I don't care if he
[00:22] keeps it on coinbase rock and roll bro
[00:25] take all those distributions that are
[00:26] coming into real estate and I buy
[00:27] Bitcoin every month with it freedom for
[00:29] me is really easy to Define man it is
[00:31] the ability to say to anything anyone
[00:35] any institution no and to be able to say
[00:38] yes to absolutely anything I want to do
[00:40] I beg everyone to follow
[00:42] Robin it's my 100th episode of the
[00:46] podcast I started it just four months
[00:48] ago so I'm doing everyday podcast and
[00:50] and getting really started with the
[00:52] podcast and I'm loving it and yeah I was
[00:55] like also have a new studio and stuff
[00:57] like that so I just wanted to get this
[00:59] out of the way and uh loving it that the
[01:02] 100th episode is with you Gary
[01:04] appreciate that's well done buddy well
[01:05] done on the 100 man celebrate the that's
[01:09] a hey you know how to get to 200 and
[01:12] doing you get to 100 first
[01:15] yeah perfect yeah um a guy a guy a guy
[01:20] that I uh this might kick our our little
[01:22] conversation off but a man that I work
[01:23] for once his name was Don and he did a
[01:27] deal I didn't like working for this guy
[01:28] he was really hard to work with
[01:30] uh he was bright freaking very smart he
[01:34] said Gary sometimes you just got to get
[01:37] on first so you can steal second base
[01:40] that's a baseball term maybe in Austria
[01:43] you don't know that but in order to
[01:44] steal second you got to get on first
[01:46] first so anyway
[01:48] congrats oh thank you thank you um yeah
[01:51] it's it's really cool to have have the
[01:53] podcast going and being full-time in
[01:55] Bitcoin now um talking about Bitcoin and
[01:59] this is the reason why I invited you
[02:01] I've seen a video I think on Twitter it
[02:03] was where you talked about real estate
[02:06] and you want to convert it to bitcoin
[02:08] and you are getting now really more and
[02:10] more involved in in into the Bitcoin
[02:12] space like let's talk first about real
[02:14] estate like where do you see the market
[02:17] going and uh why do you now get from
[02:21] Real Estate more and more into Bitcoin
[02:23] where where's the reason that you sell
[02:25] bit uh real estate and get more involved
[02:27] in the Bitcoin sphere
[02:30] so to be really clear I'm not the real
[02:32] estate card own uh the investing I do in
[02:35] the multi dwelling I do it through my
[02:37] brother that's the only business we do
[02:39] together we don't you know we have very
[02:41] very separate separate activities and
[02:43] the reason I do that with him is he is
[02:45] going to be able to locate deals much
[02:47] better than me could I go out and buy an
[02:49] apartment building I could but for what
[02:52] I pay him which is the same deal
[02:54] everybody else gets uh he picks he look
[02:58] he's on the you know he's the he's on
[03:00] the speed dial for some of these
[03:01] companies that are trying to sell some
[03:02] of these assets so uh you and I will
[03:06] never get that phone call because it's
[03:07] not what we do as a Core Business just
[03:10] like he's probably not going to get the
[03:11] phone call to do something in blockchain
[03:15] or Bitcoin that I'll get right so uh I'm
[03:18] not a big real estate guy never have
[03:19] been I find real estate to be
[03:22] very uh it's not a complicated business
[03:26] it would not hold my interest is a
[03:28] career it's a great way to make money
[03:32] but you know I think there is a myth on
[03:34] real estate how many you know
[03:36] millionaires have been made on real
[03:38] estate there are a lot of very very very
[03:40] very wealthy families that have
[03:43] Diversified or built their businesses on
[03:46] real estate but there are many
[03:49] billionaires that have been created
[03:52] through private equity which is means
[03:54] that you're building a company you're
[03:56] not building a an apartment building
[03:59] that you then leverage and and uh lease
[04:02] out you're building
[04:03] companies that aren't cash flowing very
[04:06] similar to bitcoin actually they're not
[04:09] cash flowing they're not producing cash
[04:11] they're not necessarily making enough
[04:14] money to pay the bills uh
[04:17] but uh one day five years eight years
[04:21] later they sell it for a billion dollars
[04:23] that that is what I've done my whole
[04:24] life so I build businesses and then I
[04:26] sell them um and and for me we could
[04:32] spend an hour on this conversation on
[04:33] the difference between real estate and
[04:35] Bitcoin and there are very few Sim there
[04:37] are very many
[04:40] similarities uh and I think I'm pretty
[04:44] well equipped at this point to talk
[04:46] anyone off the real estate cliff and
[04:49] move them over to bitcoin uh because
[04:51] you're not even comparing two things
[04:54] these are two completely
[04:56] different uh products or Comm you know
[05:01] assets I actually think real estate's a
[05:03] liability okay I think bitcoin's an
[05:05] asset and I think real estate is a
[05:08] liability um Bitcoin H Bitcoin held in
[05:12] self- custody is an asset with very
[05:15] little regulatory or liability risk and
[05:19] uh real estate is owned by the
[05:22] bank and I get to pay the bank the fees
[05:25] and if I pay the fees first I get the
[05:28] distributions and I get leverage from
[05:30] Real Estate that I do not get from
[05:32] Bitcoin and I build a case that housing
[05:36] there are three separate real estate
[05:38] well there's four but housing
[05:40] multi-dwelling housing is this is not an
[05:43] investment this house is not well it's
[05:45] probably an investment for me but homes
[05:48] that protect me from the rain and
[05:51] Boogeyman are not
[05:53] Investments it's a
[05:56] house okay it's just a house just like
[05:58] my car
[06:00] okay just like the plane I sit on just
[06:02] because I use planes doesn't mean I
[06:04] always buy the old Airline or I buy a
[06:07] plane right most people are never going
[06:09] to buy a plane because they don't use
[06:10] them enough so real the you know if real
[06:15] estate didn't allow you to borrow 70
[06:18] cents on the dollar tomorrow morning you
[06:21] could not borrow any money on real
[06:23] estate what is real estate price is
[06:25] going to do they're going to get cut in
[06:27] half in fact they're going to k cut
[06:30] between 50 and
[06:32] 75% because most people could never
[06:35] afford to get into a home call it
[06:37] ownership if they had to pay for the
[06:39] whole thing in
[06:41] cash same logic they're using on bitcoin
[06:44] I can't buy Bitcoin at 70 grand dude you
[06:47] just committed a
[06:48] $600,000
[06:50] house okay what are you talking about
[06:53] you bought a $600,000 house with money
[06:55] you didn't have that requires the roof
[06:59] to be fixed Insurance to be held uh you
[07:03] have to have cleaners windows need to be
[07:05] clean electricity bill paid the lawn
[07:08] needs to be mowed and the toilets get to
[07:11] be fixed and none of those things are my
[07:13] core
[07:15] business none of those things so think
[07:17] about you're working for me
[07:20] Robin it's your third day I'm paying you
[07:22] 150 Grand a year right you show up day
[07:27] three and go hey Gary uh I got to take
[07:29] off three hours to go fix the plumbing
[07:31] I'm going to say bro that ain't my
[07:33] [ __ ] problem I did not ask you to buy
[07:36] a house why don't you rent like the
[07:38] other guys or go hire a $400 plumber and
[07:41] stay at the house stay at the office and
[07:43] do your job th this is the piece I think
[07:46] a lot of wives don't understand hey you
[07:49] can't ask your husband to go out and
[07:51] kill the pigs and the bors and put food
[07:55] on the table and create protection and
[07:58] then ask them to go clean the fire
[07:59] toilet and fix the plumbing and clean
[08:02] the roof on the weekends why do you want
[08:04] to spend your life like like you've
[08:06] basically
[08:07] married a garbage collector I I mean
[08:10] like cool but like why would you you
[08:13] want that guy rested up so he can go
[08:14] kill Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday
[08:16] and Friday thus my reason for rent guys
[08:20] your age to 50 y'all should all rent man
[08:24] rent you hey roof's busted dude fix it
[08:27] it's it's it's like I I'll do a I'll do
[08:28] a 1 hour with you bring anybody on the
[08:31] planet it I'll destroy them because the
[08:32] math if you run through the math it
[08:36] makes no sense to own a home because the
[08:40] truth is you never own
[08:42] it if you don't pay the government the
[08:44] taxes to protect that land they will
[08:46] come and seize it so you never own it
[08:50] and and this is in America dude in
[08:51] Austria you definitely don't own it
[08:54] England you definitely don't own it they
[08:56] do 100e leases in in England the queen
[08:58] owns every
[09:00] everything right so and if you actually
[09:03] just thought about that okay Washington
[09:06] the federal government and the queen and
[09:09] the
[09:11] Austrian
[09:13] megalodons they own it all you get to
[09:16] pay to use it so all you're actually
[09:19] doing is renting anyway it's just one
[09:22] big lease Market I look at Bitcoin I go
[09:25] Nobody But Me owns Bitcoin it's sitting
[09:28] here in
[09:29] this system right here whatever whether
[09:32] it's in my hard wallet cool it's sitting
[09:34] here it has no roof to fix no Plumbing
[09:38] that can go wrong it actually had I I
[09:42] consider Bitcoin a monopoly One of a
[09:45] Kind finite never before seen in the
[09:48] history of mankind except you and me
[09:51] we're the only finite unique one-of aind
[09:54] creatures on this planet along with some
[09:57] other many organisms right and what do
[10:00] we do to all those things we don't know
[10:03] how to treat any of those things so my
[10:06] thesis is very philosophical almost
[10:08] religious Humanity has 7,000 year
[10:12] history of abusing oneof a kind finite
[10:18] unique creatures I'm quite certain no
[10:22] one including myself has placed the
[10:24] correct value on bitcoin because it has
[10:27] all the inherent qualities of a human
[10:31] Spirit I'm an identical twin we could
[10:34] not be more different okay like if you
[10:37] met I I could literally grab half of the
[10:41] people that ever seen Grant before in
[10:43] his life that don't like him the half
[10:46] that don't like him will probably like
[10:49] me um so isn't that interesting right we
[10:53] we as humans do not know how to
[10:57] Value unique we only know how to price
[11:00] things I I'll tell you a very
[11:02] interesting story I know people that
[11:05] will drive three more miles to get three
[11:07] cents off their
[11:10] gas okay okay three cents they know the
[11:14] price of
[11:15] everything but they do not know the
[11:18] value of anything and this is the point
[11:21] of oh wow Robin's Up Up on the Roof
[11:23] going to probably break his leg cleaning
[11:27] leaves I'm sure he's really enjoying
[11:30] himself sweating in cold Austrian
[11:33] weather when he should be having sex
[11:36] with his damn wife or his girlfriend
[11:40] communicating with his family
[11:42] man like it's like wow this is what
[11:45] being married like I get to clean the
[11:47] roof right and so you become a slave
[11:50] dude become a slave to these things that
[11:52] y'all say you own and you don't own it
[11:55] it's not
[11:56] ownership I totally in 100 100% full
[12:00] fully heartedly agree with that that's
[12:02] really really cool I also see like the
[12:04] Bitcoin is the I don't know if you see
[12:05] it also like that but I see Bitcoin is
[12:08] the only thing you actually truly can
[12:10] own it's like a monopoly it's it's a
[12:13] monopoly on money that people have to
[12:16] realize that it actually is a monopoly
[12:18] right now people don't realize it uh but
[12:21] it's a
[12:22] monopoly which nobody can manipulate
[12:26] like it's it's no no one state can
[12:29] interfere with it nothing can happen
[12:31] with it it's it's a fascinating
[12:33] technology yeah when I was 32 years old
[12:37] uh I built a maxim and the maxim goes
[12:41] like this because I was I have always
[12:43] competed with
[12:46] monopolies and the the there are three
[12:48] rules okay if you own a monopoly do
[12:51] everything you can to keep it man like
[12:53] pay every politician lawyer lobbyist
[12:56] whatever right if you own a monopoly you
[12:59] will do anything to keep it if you can't
[13:02] own a monopoly go partner with
[13:04] one buddy up to one right and use this
[13:08] big hammer to make your business if you
[13:10] can't do either one of those hire a
[13:13] bunch of young guys that want to take
[13:15] two three four million out of them
[13:17] there'll be teams of people that'll
[13:19] swarm on these freaking monopolies and
[13:21] just bust them up in the pieces that's
[13:24] the pl that's the role I've always had
[13:25] to play because I've never been invited
[13:27] to the club but now I have Bitcoin to
[13:30] your
[13:31] point this is an this is cannot be
[13:34] regulated
[13:36] Monopoly that is freaking heavy dude
[13:39] this is a monopoly that cannot be
[13:41] regulated and the only Monopoly like it
[13:43] in the world truly
[13:46] Global GL Google can get pushed out of
[13:50] China okay Visa Mastercard haven't made
[13:55] [ __ ] for progress in China and many
[13:58] other countries they say they're Global
[13:59] they are but really they're just carving
[14:02] out more and more margins from the same
[14:04] people over and over and
[14:06] over Bitcoin will be in every country
[14:09] everywhere every Speck of sand and piece
[14:12] of land on the planet legal or not legal
[14:15] right it's going to find its way into
[14:16] every crack and crevice that is truly a
[14:19] global market
[14:21] man no language
[14:24] barriers no letters to send no address
[14:27] to send a letter to if the CE a Visa
[14:29] gets killed in an airplane tomorrow
[14:31] morning price will be impacted
[14:34] Bitcoin this is why I don't like
[14:36] ethereum you tell me that vitalic gets
[14:40] killed on an airplane that the price of
[14:42] ethereum should get crushed don't don't
[14:45] tell me that oh well it's decentralized
[14:47] well really well who's second in command
[14:50] dude because that's scary okay we've
[14:52] seen the
[14:54] decentralized has massive problems
[14:58] everybody wants Bitcoin wants to talk
[15:00] about the the glory of decentralization
[15:03] decentralization is hyper inefficient
[15:06] hyper inefficient centralization is
[15:08] extremely efficient you bring everything
[15:11] in one pool you analyze it as long as
[15:13] you're
[15:14] neutral right and one person handles all
[15:17] the debris I was with Mark yuso a couple
[15:20] of weeks ago you probably know him
[15:22] margan Creek capital big Bitcoin guy he
[15:25] was going on about centralization he's a
[15:27] little bit younger than me and I went
[15:28] now Mark we're having a tequila One
[15:31] Night in Miami I said now Mark if your
[15:34] God and my God that we share the exact
[15:37] same God was running Central Finance for
[15:41] the globe we would say hey let's
[15:44] centralize because centralization makes
[15:46] a lot of sense the problem with
[15:47] centralization is the guy at the top
[15:49] always goes
[15:51] bad right and then they you know then
[15:54] then games start playing and then
[15:56] there's
[15:57] opacity opacity is the inability to see
[16:00] in through and into something it's dark
[16:04] as soon as you see uh Darkness you know
[16:07] there's Monopoly constructs in play
[16:10] right and that's the beauty of Bitcoin
[16:11] it should be all open source it should
[16:14] be transparent we are going to live in a
[16:16] world in the future there'll be one
[16:18] group of people that want to be ultra
[16:20] opaque and then there'll be a group of
[16:22] people that want to be transparent I
[16:24] choose to live in the transparent world
[16:26] that means open-source blockchain
[16:30] public blockchains not private
[16:33] blockchains uh and people are going to
[16:34] be able to make a choice but uh I I
[16:37] think you know we're going through this
[16:40] Chasm of change that people are going to
[16:42] now really begin to understand how the
[16:45] world
[16:46] works because they're going to have to
[16:48] they're going to see the difference
[16:49] between these two worlds there are very
[16:51] very big differences between these two
[16:53] worlds that we're trying to bridge the
[16:56] past analog into the future are
[17:00] digital and everything gets digitized
[17:02] this is not going to be just a little
[17:04] partial game dude it all gets digitized
[17:08] now this is the piece people are missing
[17:10] like my brother like you have to use
[17:12] really really really basic this is my
[17:15] beauty because I'm just such a simple
[17:18] human being I think in little simple
[17:20] pictures and draw things all the time we
[17:23] are never going back to the at track
[17:25] tape
[17:26] man never yes what's that thank you I
[17:30] was hoping somebody what the [ __ ] is
[17:32] that bro that's the way I used to listen
[17:34] to music in my in my 1966 Mustang
[17:38] looking all cool me and Grant are
[17:40] smoking a joint 17 years old going to
[17:43] high school 8:00 in the morning and
[17:46] we're listening to Grand Funk you know
[17:49] or some mtown on this tape that's this
[17:53] big dude that you stick into this box in
[17:55] the car that's about the size of a a
[17:57] large 12 V battery I mean a 12 12 I mean
[18:00] a car battery and we were totally cool
[18:03] dude now a 30 50
[18:07] 60,000 videos and audio what this is not
[18:10] going to get smaller dude I'm not even
[18:13] going to have this thing one day this
[18:15] thing's not this is now heavy okay our
[18:19] my hands are starting to change because
[18:21] the way I hold this goes away dude it
[18:24] compression everything's just going to
[18:26] get compressed Tighter and Tighter and
[18:28] Tighter it's massive packets of
[18:30] information look what we're doing right
[18:32] here I I I don't even have a a um a
[18:36] great camera on this deal this a this is
[18:39] high quality resolution okay like CNN is
[18:43] going to have a challenge beating this
[18:46] and they paid millions of dollars okay
[18:49] millions and millions of dollars for
[18:51] this equipment the equipment cost you're
[18:52] coming down $600 for a decent camera
[18:55] some lights 50 bucks right a couple of
[18:58] computers
[18:59] boom we're up and running we're
[19:01] digitized planet Earth right now we
[19:03] don't even know
[19:05] it amazing and and what do you imagine
[19:08] the I mean it's really amazing if if you
[19:11] think about uh just the podcast industry
[19:13] I run my podcast completely alone I do
[19:17] every day an episode every day a
[19:19] different guest every day an episode uh
[19:22] and it's and I even have time next to it
[19:26] because AI is doing a lot of the post
[19:28] produ production uh I just try to keep
[19:31] uh keep it good and do the the quality
[19:33] control but it does me does take me like
[19:36] maybe five hours the whole podcast
[19:38] episode with pre with the pre poost and
[19:41] the recording uh so this can be
[19:44] extremely efficient and I think it will
[19:46] be even more efficient in like five
[19:47] years and my my question is now like uh
[19:50] where do you see Bitcoin in this Digital
[19:52] World um well before we do that and I
[19:57] think it is important question
[19:59] but what you excuse me what you just
[20:01] said was hey in five
[20:03] years see see what you're doing you're
[20:06] spending five hours a day creating
[20:09] content I would have never ever known
[20:11] you had it not been for
[20:13] Bitcoin uh I would you and I would not
[20:16] be together but there's this Central
[20:17] kind of philosophy or thought process
[20:19] I've never done this in my other
[20:21] Industries natural gas and electricity
[20:24] credit card processing and real estate
[20:27] hey let's all get on on uh Skype or get
[20:30] on X or get on YouTube and talk about
[20:34] Finance 8,000 people show up a million
[20:38] people see a video your age demographic
[20:42] 22 to
[20:45] 62 whoa okay so imagine What's Happening
[20:48] Here we don't even have Bitcoin involved
[20:51] in this process and we are
[20:52] decentralizing our
[20:55] news it's already happened we have
[20:57] decentralized new I beg everyone to
[21:00] follow Robin in his footsteps become a
[21:05] podcaster Okay the reason for that I
[21:07] don't care if it's good if you talk
[21:09] about dirty
[21:10] underwear talk about whatever you want
[21:13] man there's going to be some people out
[21:14] there that share a common theme with you
[21:17] so one you can connect because I think
[21:20] currency is communication we forgot this
[21:24] okay currency is about communicating
[21:26] when I send you money dude I am
[21:27] communicating with you hey thanks a lot
[21:30] Robin I'm really happy with the service
[21:33] that you gave me and I'm going to give
[21:35] you something in exchange thanks dude
[21:38] exchange boom boom and we'll repeat it
[21:41] right it's currency I could send you a
[21:44] hug some people do the Emoji that's a
[21:47] currency man wouldn't it be cool Grant
[21:51] not used to play
[21:54] uh Command and Conquer or one of these
[21:57] games Halo you know I mean 35 40 year
[22:00] old grown men dude playing kill games
[22:02] for two hours I'm in London he's in La
[22:06] we're playing for $10,000 a game okay
[22:09] like he had to send me a Range Rover
[22:11] once because he lost so much money from
[22:13] a Halo game I ripped his face off a
[22:17] whole Hummer man that shows up he still
[22:19] had XM he still had a satellite radio I
[22:22] used that satellite radio for three
[22:24] years and he had to give me the car free
[22:27] my point was I told him this is 15 years
[22:29] ago I said dudee wouldn't it be cool if
[22:31] I could send you some money right now
[22:32] for losing the
[22:33] game but I can't see I can't with this I
[22:38] I can't I can't with dollar
[22:40] bills because this this stuff is
[22:44] awesome it's awesome when you and I are
[22:48] like within arms
[22:50] length it's what I call proximity okay
[22:54] proximity to your clients awesome for
[22:56] this but once it gets to be 500 ft I
[22:59] need to use a credit card or some or
[23:01] venmo or something
[23:03] else you're an Austria dude I got to use
[23:06] something and my opportunities to use
[23:09] something is okay I'm going to send you
[23:10] $1,000 Robin and you'll get it next
[23:13] Thursday or Friday and the bank will let
[23:16] you use it the following in Austria
[23:18] they'll let you use it the following
[23:19] week or two uh that's kind of slow
[23:25] considering we're doing a podcast and
[23:26] half a million people are going to see
[23:28] it right now now right so I I I don't
[23:31] think the question about where's bitco
[23:33] coin's role in the future you don't
[23:35] digitize the world and then not digitize
[23:39] the currency that's associated with that
[23:42] digitization event right this is why I
[23:45] keep saying hey let's quit talking about
[23:46] money let's talk about what's happening
[23:49] we are taking the internet and doing
[23:52] what it should have done 20 years ago
[23:55] but the idea was so big Google Apple
[24:01] Microsoft and every other swinging dick
[24:04] on the planet except we chat China
[24:07] understood that the internet was about
[24:09] communication so let's build in some
[24:11] money functions to it the entire
[24:13] Financial system has been untouched in
[24:16] fact it has
[24:18] been placed on steroids at aall and
[24:22] everything else they benefited greatly
[24:24] from the internet dude like you have
[24:26] card schemes like Visa MasterCard
[24:28] charging
[24:30] 8% to move a product that they have no
[24:34] transaction risk in
[24:36] whatsoever that goes away in a digital
[24:39] world okay you're not going to have one
[24:41] guy just going hey I don't like this
[24:42] particular product so we're charging 8%
[24:44] for it so they missed that and what's
[24:47] happening right now is web 3.0 is about
[24:50] making money work across this
[24:53] connectivity right it's making money
[24:56] work and it's not going to work with
[24:58] this and it's not going to work with
[24:59] wire transfers it's not even going to
[25:01] work with credit cards because these are
[25:04] going to be
[25:05] microtransactions okay these are going
[25:07] to be sub four4 doll transactions dollar
[25:10] I mean there's
[25:11] already like the US government and other
[25:14] countries going to have to even look at
[25:15] how they Define
[25:18] microtransactions and what shell
[25:20] companies are and like this is changing
[25:23] so radically I don't even think the laws
[25:26] are set up properly to to deal with the
[25:31] significance of the change we're
[25:33] encountering
[25:35] here and history shows us I'm sorry to
[25:37] go on so long but history shows
[25:40] us that we always underestimate
[25:43] change we under we overestimate how
[25:46] quickly it
[25:47] happens and then we underestimate the
[25:50] absolute colossal size of the
[25:53] ramifications the the uh unintended
[25:57] unthought of consequences of rolling out
[26:00] this typee of
[26:01] transparency will lead to war riots
[26:05] civil
[26:06] unrest and and and probably new laws
[26:09] being
[26:10] written I think we need it I think uh
[26:14] without them that it will be really
[26:16] really interesting where do you see
[26:18] actually politics and governments and um
[26:21] going when we have Bitcoin as actually
[26:24] the base layer and and and governments
[26:26] have a hard and harder time to in later
[26:28] occurrences and maybe even have a harder
[26:30] time to tax people um do you see change
[26:34] in the political system in the in the
[26:36] government systems uh coming in the next
[26:38] like 10 50 100 Years Years
[26:41] even well there's definitely change
[26:44] coming uh what it's going to look like
[26:48] um I think we have to really Define hey
[26:50] what is BAS layer because I think if you
[26:53] said bitcoin's going to become the base
[26:55] layer I think there's a lot of people
[26:57] that would have have different
[26:59] impressions of what that
[27:01] means right and I think this is one of
[27:04] the areas where
[27:05] decentralization has been a problem for
[27:07] Bitcoin because in fact there is no
[27:11] consistent message on what the that base
[27:15] layer means I mean most people that have
[27:18] been in Bitcoin for more than eight
[27:20] years two cycles plus Bas layer means we
[27:24] are the government we've taken over
[27:26] everything everything thing is built on
[27:29] B Bitcoin there is no war there's no
[27:32] poverty there's no cancer because
[27:35] Bitcoin solves absolutely every
[27:37] psychosis which I just think is a
[27:39] [ __ ] ridiculous comment it's too much
[27:42] man um like you're still going to have
[27:46] people whether I know rich people that
[27:48] don't have money problems and they would
[27:51] love to fight somebody okay they'd love
[27:52] to go to war they're unhappy people and
[27:55] they're going to be bent and unhappy
[27:57] till they die
[27:58] uh that's doesn't Bitcoin doesn't solve
[28:01] psychosis um and and quite frankly I
[28:05] wouldn't say any of this about Bas layer
[28:08] if it happens cool like if you believe
[28:12] Bitcoin is this this hot and I think
[28:15] she's a hot babe dude I mean like
[28:18] doesn't degrade doesn't get old doesn't
[28:20] [ __ ] I can sell a fragment of her and
[28:24] she doesn't even complain to me I can
[28:25] lease her out it's not even considered
[28:27] like I get no push back from this
[28:31] asset because there's nobody holding I
[28:34] can't do that with an apartment building
[28:35] I got to call my banker up for
[28:38] permission see see the difference
[28:40] between real estate even if I'm in
[28:43] apartment building do I got to call
[28:44] somebody up and get
[28:46] permission um so one I don't know why we
[28:50] would want to tell the IMF the Federal
[28:52] Reserve the bank of England and the rest
[28:55] of these creatures that we want to put
[28:58] poke them in their eyeball and take away
[28:59] their Monopoly ball like why you want to
[29:02] do that like let's just kind of Skittle
[29:04] in here get Black Rock to like the ETF
[29:08] once they see the returns do we we'll
[29:10] we'll do this thing if it's as good as
[29:12] it's supposed to be it will act like
[29:15] Mercury and find every
[29:17] Gap okay it'll
[29:19] just take over we are being like too
[29:23] reactive just stick to our knitting man
[29:26] we have an awesome product it's unlike
[29:29] no other
[29:30] product and uh let's get it to Institute
[29:34] look Satoshi said peer toer money right
[29:38] I think people
[29:39] misinterpret well they don't
[29:41] misinterpret they put into
[29:43] their into how they read what they
[29:46] understood PE peer-to peer is hey let's
[29:48] do it tomorrow we ain't ready for
[29:51] tomorrow bro okay you're just like Mr
[29:53] Satoshi you're like every other
[29:56] technologist you have a vision and you
[29:58] think you can make it work tomorrow
[30:00] morning what if he's wrong what if his
[30:02] vision was peerto peer but he forgot to
[30:04] tell everybody hey by the way you need
[30:06] to go contact Gary Cardone or somebody
[30:08] like him because there's a whole step
[30:10] process that you're gonna have to do
[30:13] before you go per appear on scale and
[30:16] what is that that's ETFs derivatives
[30:19] paper products institutional banking I
[30:22] mean look this industry [ __ ] up
[30:24] letting Bit Black Rock in and they
[30:26] [ __ ] up because they did did not
[30:30] self-regulate okay they did not call out
[30:32] y'all knew there were criminals playing
[30:34] in this [ __ ] pool okay and y'all sitting
[30:37] there going hey people are making money
[30:39] cool dude the toilet always gets
[30:42] flushed sooner or later you flush the
[30:44] toilet and the problem is if you're
[30:46] hanging near it even if you're a good
[30:48] actor you get flushed with it so I have
[30:52] zero empathy for anyone that lost money
[30:55] in this deal like bro ser
[30:58] seriously you went into Celsius they're
[31:01] paying 18% and the fed's paying
[31:04] zero and you thought that was going to
[31:07] last forever and by the way some of you
[31:10] Wall Street guys didn't call foul on
[31:13] that the regulator didn't know what the
[31:16] hell was the Regulator doing he must
[31:18] have been looking at some big crimes to
[31:20] miss that one okay and they're not
[31:22] looking at Big crimes they're looking at
[31:25] how they get reelected and they they
[31:27] they they they probably well like our go
[31:29] our SEC is falling apart dude there's
[31:31] [ __ ] coming out our SEC it's I think all
[31:34] governments are getting ready to lose
[31:35] their credibility just like Hollywood's
[31:37] losing their credibility see what's
[31:39] happening here man all the cartel all
[31:42] the constructs from the past and this is
[31:44] not about Bitcoin this is about a cycle
[31:48] all constructs from the past are being
[31:50] challenged now all the alliances all the
[31:53] deals all the rules what are
[31:56] rules me and you are EMP power and we
[31:58] decide hey these are the rules dude this
[32:00] is what we want and we create some rules
[32:03] and then we change
[32:04] them okay all of these rules and
[32:08] constructs there's going to be a day
[32:10] when I am not allowed to get my Range
[32:12] Rover on the highway because I will be
[32:16] the mo the biggest variable on the
[32:18] highway if there's a thousand robot cars
[32:21] and Gary's out there dud we're going to
[32:23] have a
[32:24] wreck right so who's the whole
[32:27] automobile the highway guys they're all
[32:29] going to want to hold on to their stuff
[32:30] right we're just going through this
[32:33] massive step change and it's going to
[32:35] impact everything man art real estate
[32:39] money opportunities for people like you
[32:43] bro the opportunities millions of jobs
[32:46] y'all should everybody should go talk to
[32:48] their politicians and don't mention
[32:50] Bitcoin say hey there's millions of jobs
[32:53] that people don't have to go to college
[32:56] to perform
[32:58] I could hire 10 people right now
[33:00] man with no skills just be willing to
[33:03] learn show up on time listen don't do
[33:07] any drugs like you just got to get your
[33:09] head clear and go hey I'm going to learn
[33:10] from a
[33:12] master and
[33:14] uh nobody else knows what's going on
[33:16] dude we've never seen this before okay
[33:20] so there's no skills really
[33:22] required uh it you have to be willing to
[33:25] study and learn
[33:28] uh so I was with Congress two Congress
[33:30] people this week I've never done
[33:32] anything in politics but I know that I
[33:34] am a good voice to be able to help
[33:36] educate them this isn't about Bitcoin
[33:38] this is about jobs okay this is about
[33:40] prosperity for the government prosperity
[33:42] for our country uh gives us an
[33:46] option uh if I'm if I'm a I mean I've
[33:49] got kids man I look at my kids my kids
[33:51] are going to be fine because they have
[33:53] good
[33:54] discipline but uh
[34:00] like I don't know what all these people
[34:02] are going to do they they don't have any
[34:04] basic core understanding of almost
[34:07] anything
[34:08] man really like like just
[34:12] the I mean I didn't embarrass you on the
[34:14] house thing right like I
[34:17] but when you hear me explain the house
[34:20] thing you're like whoa nobody's ever
[34:22] said it that
[34:23] way why not see I blame the teacher
[34:28] and the leaders this is why I'm doing
[34:30] this people are going hey why are you
[34:32] spinning up a media company I'm not I'm
[34:35] spining up I'm spining up an
[34:38] education
[34:40] company because I have been bitching
[34:42] about education since I can remember
[34:44] since probably the ninth
[34:47] grade I've been like I hate you people
[34:50] dude uphor High School uphor College
[34:54] uphor any type of leadership that that
[34:58] it's all authority with enforcement
[35:01] instead of
[35:02] practicality and today to me we got to
[35:05] get really practical okay like I don't
[35:07] know I'm not a smart guy but I can
[35:09] explain blockchain and Bitcoin extremely
[35:12] well now to almost anyone without them
[35:15] having to read a book or understanding
[35:19] blockchain or what a seed phrase is you
[35:22] imagine when you say that to a 52y old
[35:25] guy the first thing is you understand he
[35:28] doesn't really understand what that
[35:30] means right you just use
[35:33] terminology that I'm certain he has no
[35:37] clue what seed phrase
[35:39] means and I see this happen all the time
[35:41] dude 800 people in a room and people are
[35:45] so excited about their coding proudness
[35:47] that they forgot who the customer is and
[35:50] the customer is adoption of 8 billion
[35:53] people don't ask someone to be
[35:55] completely dirt poor to have to
[35:57] understand this
[35:59] product and then don't make a really
[36:02] rich person bad for being rich and
[36:06] thinking about custody different than
[36:08] you do let the guy come in the door dude
[36:12] without offending him well I don't care
[36:15] if he keeps it on coinbase rock and roll
[36:17] bro now what can I do to educate you to
[36:20] get more Bitcoin stick it in your IRA
[36:25] now hey by the way you know might be
[36:27] good for you to have half a million
[36:28] dollars on a wallet bro let me tell you
[36:31] why okay but you cannot talk to a guy
[36:33] and go hey I need you to put $800
[36:35] million on bitcoin because all your
[36:38] paper is going to be destroyed tomorrow
[36:40] morning he's got a billion dollars in
[36:43] other paper in Legacy assets like
[36:45] bro what are you talking about right
[36:48] you're you're and by the way none of
[36:51] those banks have ever stolen money from
[36:53] me like this this Ponzi game of printing
[36:56] money can go on for a long long long
[36:58] long long time you'll be dead dude
[37:02] so look the only way Bitcoin becomes
[37:04] first
[37:05] layer in the next 10 years and it could
[37:09] World War
[37:10] III massive Global un risk Mad
[37:14] Max okay and this is why I get upset
[37:17] with
[37:18] the the Pioneers because I'm like bro I
[37:22] know I know your [ __ ] cost you 10 cents
[37:24] and you got no loss here but for first
[37:27] off you need to be selling your coins
[37:30] that is healthy for the
[37:32] market secondly if I make a shitload of
[37:34] money in Bitcoin it will be all
[37:38] redeployed into Bitcoin blockchain
[37:42] education digital everything helping
[37:44] this planet I don't know who taught you
[37:48] guys that you're just going to make a
[37:49] bunch of money and go go on a saleboat
[37:51] that is not helping anyone it is totally
[37:53] against satoshi's like it's [ __ ]
[37:56] twisted
[37:58] man um and so maybe you guys need to
[38:01] read some books on how to deliver a
[38:02] proper message to large audiences and
[38:04] make this safer I'm sorry to go off but
[38:07] it's just a little it's it well it cost
[38:10] me a billion dollars okay I I I I saw a
[38:14] Bitcoin in
[38:16] 2016 and because of the the messaging
[38:19] was so bad I was like [ __ ] it dude I'm
[38:22] out it it's just a Mickey Mouse
[38:25] show um now I was wrong about that but I
[38:29] was also right and I wonder how many
[38:31] people walked away from this so so my
[38:34] job is to help explain this so we don't
[38:35] have guys like me walking away because
[38:37] quite frankly I think I've done a lot to
[38:40] help in a really really short period of
[38:42] time to bring a lot of really normal
[38:47] wealthy successful people into looking
[38:50] at this differently um and we don't need
[38:54] to take over the FED to win the game
[38:57] okay I I I remember when you guys were
[38:59] arguing whether it's going to be half a
[39:01] percent or not bro it's going to be
[39:03] three and a half to 10 per. okay I'm I'm
[39:06] telling you right now
[39:07] allocations will be 3 and a half% and
[39:10] this is going to happen in two and a
[39:11] half years you're going to see
[39:13] allocations that are crazy my allocation
[39:16] is 85
[39:18] 88% of my liquid worth is in
[39:21] Bitcoin okay and I'm
[39:24] 66 and other older people should be you
[39:28] you should be monly allocated you're
[39:32] young bro if it fails you can go create
[39:35] something I'll give you a job
[39:38] me I've got my kids taken care of when
[39:41] you see an opportunity like this you
[39:43] spank it out you don't put one or two
[39:45] perent the other thing is these people
[39:47] are not coming in
[39:49] for hey I'm going to put four four grand
[39:51] into it no dude these people that are
[39:54] coming in it's a quarter of a million
[39:55] dollar pop it's four Bitcoin a
[39:58] pop right that that that is so you guys
[40:03] are sitting there going man this guy's
[40:04] talking big money you're getting ready
[40:06] to compete with big money that's why I'm
[40:08] trying to tell you like you have to get
[40:11] out of this I can only buy one tenth of
[40:12] a Bitcoin that's [ __ ] dude go get a
[40:16] job man go make 4050 Grand okay I I've
[40:19] got some production I need to do right
[40:20] now I'd pay somebody $5,000 show up this
[40:23] weekend with some
[40:25] production like instantly
[40:27] so you need to go out make some money
[40:30] and turn and to me this is the best
[40:32] Bitcoin miner on the planet does this I
[40:35] go to work I create some Fiat
[40:40] [ __ ] uh dollars and I immediately
[40:43] take those dollars and stick them into
[40:44] Bitcoin that's Bitcoin
[40:46] mining okay trash turn into gold digital
[40:50] gold uranium Platinum perfect gold never
[40:53] goes away never erodes can't be ripped
[40:56] out of my hand so I I don't know I I I
[41:00] would get a job and I would get a job in
[41:02] the industry so that what you're doing
[41:04] is very very correlated to your own
[41:08] investment thesis if you're in the oil
[41:10] and gas business I guess you can invest
[41:11] in oil and gas I'm not sure that's the
[41:14] best investment but you should have some
[41:16] investment in the industry you're
[41:17] working in if you don't it kind of says
[41:20] a lot about the
[41:22] industry right you're investing your
[41:25] time and energy but won't invest money
[41:29] in that same industry it's and that is
[41:32] what we're talking about okay we're
[41:34] talking about two things really
[41:36] time and
[41:39] freedom time and freedom th those are
[41:42] the things that are important not how
[41:44] much money you're
[41:46] making once you start looking at things
[41:48] in time you're like oh there's only one
[41:51] money that makes up for my time
[41:54] Decay right
[41:57] and that that that is
[41:59] Bitcoin most people won't understand
[42:02] that but like I can take you through a
[42:03] chart and show you how that is
[42:06] absolutely real and then you got to just
[42:08] ask yourself with the if time and
[42:11] freedom are the two things that are
[42:12] really really really important what is
[42:15] freedom what is freedom I told you a lot
[42:17] about 21 Bitcoin the best place for me
[42:20] to buy Bitcoin directly on a Bitcoin
[42:22] only exchange but now let's talk about
[42:25] how to secure your Bitcoin coin once you
[42:27] got Bitcoin you don't want to leave them
[42:29] on Exchange you want to take self
[42:32] custody you want to take responsibility
[42:35] of your own Bitcoin that's why I
[42:37] recommend getting a bitbox bitbox is an
[42:41] amazing wallet where you can not only
[42:43] keep your Bitcoin in a simple way very
[42:46] secure you can even create a passphrase
[42:49] with that passphrase you can basically
[42:51] create a hidden wallet on the device
[42:55] itself make sure to buy your bit box in
[42:58] the link down in the description and
[43:00] with code Robin you even get a 5%
[43:02] discount I had um uh Community questions
[43:06] I asked the community if if they have uh
[43:08] questions for you and I plan to do it
[43:11] later but uh one of the questions is
[43:13] just fitting in there so nicely now and
[43:16] he was asking uh to in order as you
[43:19] described in order to save in Bitcoin
[43:21] you have to have disposable income like
[43:23] you have to have some feat mining job
[43:25] where you mine Bitcoin with it
[43:27] and get income and he asked the the the
[43:32] questions how do you uh level up your
[43:35] income game like what what is your uh
[43:39] advice for someone uh not um happy with
[43:43] his income and how do he does he level
[43:46] up his his
[43:47] game
[43:48] uh
[43:52] well first is I would like to ask your
[43:55] audience so if you got a post or however
[43:57] you're seeing those Communications Gary
[43:59] wants to know how you define Freedom
[44:02] okay this is extremely important most
[44:04] people don't even understand time
[44:06] dude and uh you know I ask most people
[44:10] hey hey like why are you working so hard
[44:12] what do you want right why why do you
[44:13] want to make a bunch of money to that
[44:15] guy hey wh
[44:16] why most people end up going hey I Want
[44:19] to Be Free dude so I'm just asking
[44:21] people what that means the first thing I
[44:23] would say to your friend is if he was
[44:25] asking me and he like I have people
[44:27] people that come to me and go hey I'd
[44:28] like you to help me you know do a
[44:30] weekend something the first thing I do
[44:31] is go show me what your debt is the best
[44:34] way to level your game up is get rid of
[44:36] the [ __ ] that's caus pulling you
[44:39] back okay and if you have 12 15 18% debt
[44:44] on a credit card you need to turn that
[44:47] credit card into plastic nothing burn it
[44:52] quit using it you clearly don't know
[44:54] what you're doing with it
[44:57] I have two credit cards I have a
[44:58] American Express card that always gets
[45:01] closed out and I have
[45:05] a uh maybe a another credit card that I
[45:09] bet I don't spend $20 a month
[45:12] on okay $20 I I don't have debt if I do
[45:17] have debt it's because a bank gave me a
[45:19] bunch of it and I'm doing something else
[45:21] right my debts never in the but it's 6%
[45:24] or three and it's not debt that I can't
[45:26] get rid of tomorrow morning if I want to
[45:28] but somebody holding $6,000 worth of
[45:30] debt on a car and you're paying 12% you
[45:33] need to sell the damn car
[45:35] dude you need to sell the car you're
[45:38] paying $800 a month 800 EUR a month for
[45:41] a lease on a car that's degrading in
[45:45] value and you only use it 4% of the time
[45:48] really that why don't you just go pay a
[45:51] pay a
[45:52] pimp right you'd be better off I mean
[45:55] imagine like
[45:57] there's so many middlemen in this deal
[45:59] okay because you wouldn't buy that car
[46:01] you can't afford the car dude you bought
[46:03] a car you can't
[46:05] afford and you're fighting with me right
[46:07] now your mind's like oh I don't like
[46:09] this cat bro if you could afford it you
[46:11] would have paid
[46:12] cash okay so you bought a car too big
[46:15] for you
[46:16] even can't have an $800 note dude
[46:20] because your note's not even 800 it's
[46:21] 800 plus the 150 on the
[46:24] insurance now it's 950 M oh that's not a
[46:28] lot 10%
[46:31] dude so first thing is you get your your
[46:34] own you know spending under control you
[46:39] start looking at how many times you go
[46:40] to Starbucks and buy $10 coffee you
[46:43] should be buying $10 worth of
[46:44] bitcoin [ __ ] that coffee bro first off
[46:48] the company's not even a good company
[46:50] okay it's like not helping people
[46:52] it's it's it's woke okay it's selling
[46:57] bad
[46:58] [ __ ] um sorry okay but it is I used to
[47:02] be a big client of theirs and I'm like
[47:03] man once you open the toilets up to
[47:05] everybody because you got so wokey I
[47:07] quit
[47:08] going like this isn't cool it's not okay
[47:12] just to open the doors up to everyone
[47:13] man you need to pay your way my God back
[47:18] to the toilet
[47:20] conversation
[47:22] right um so that's the first thing I
[47:25] would do man and I think most people
[47:27] undervalue who they are or they
[47:30] overvalue their who they
[47:32] are um I have never had a problem making
[47:35] money I I I have never ever had a
[47:39] problem making
[47:40] money I back to the real estate question
[47:44] if you are doing real
[47:46] estate and you're getting distributions
[47:49] like I get from Real
[47:50] Estate I take all those distributions
[47:53] that are coming into real estate and I
[47:54] buy Bitcoin every month with it
[47:57] and I will continue to do that and I am
[47:59] imploring you real estate people to look
[48:01] at this differently dude and if you
[48:04] don't if you're challenging me right now
[48:06] about hey real estate play what did you
[48:08] just say take the distributions in the
[48:09] bigcoin can reach out to me I will walk
[48:12] you through this and 20 minutes you'll
[48:13] be like wow that's that's freaking
[48:16] awesome uh and I'm going to predict that
[48:19] we're going to see in the next 18 months
[48:21] we're going to see some monster whales
[48:23] in Bitcoin do exactly that and I'm here
[48:27] to help him do it too it makes a lot of
[48:29] sense for a guy holding 40,000 Bitcoin
[48:32] at
[48:34] $7 okay uh okay if you guys like living
[48:38] in a
[48:39] jungle or you're creating a city or a
[48:42] country I got it okay you got to
[48:44] sacrifice something but dude I didn't do
[48:48] all this work to live in the jungle with
[48:52] WiFi
[48:53] 2.0 slow connectivity
[48:57] bad airports not clean water and maybe
[49:00] my children get stolen from me right I
[49:03] don't think that's back to Mad Max okay
[49:05] layer one who cares dude layer one's
[49:08] going to be my 45 Cal I mean I you know
[49:11] like that's not a world I want to live
[49:12] in I I would rather not have
[49:16] censorship and have a little bit of
[49:17] money broken because if we don't have
[49:20] censorship that's the real issue
[49:23] censorship the ability back to the
[49:25] freedom thing hey what's Freedom I'm
[49:27] going to just keep asking that question
[49:29] because nobody actually knows what it
[49:31] is and most certainly most people think
[49:34] it's
[49:35] free but one thing I am certain freedom
[49:38] is not
[49:39] free and everybody thinks it's free
[49:42] because I don't see anybody doing
[49:44] anything to risk anything like me hey
[49:47] dude visa and MasterCard are not good
[49:49] companies it's a massive duopoly
[49:53] structure and
[49:54] they're they're they're they're
[49:57] parasitic on small
[49:59] players okay that's my big problem with
[50:02] you're a big giant company and all you
[50:03] can do is go stick your beak Into the
[50:06] Heart of some middle inome
[50:09] family right or the banks like it's not
[50:12] cool come pick on me awesome I can I can
[50:15] take it but not don't pick on you dude
[50:18] like they're not even letting you get
[50:20] off the RAC trck right like you can't
[50:23] even get started the the gravity is so
[50:25] heavy this to your friend this is where
[50:28] the real gravity is right here you fix
[50:30] this dude and fix how many teachers and
[50:33] parents and uncles taught you the wrong
[50:36] thing about living Freedom how the world
[50:40] Works
[50:41] money your own beliefs of your own self
[50:44] and how you devalue yourself if you
[50:47] can't value yourself properly how the
[50:48] hell are you going to ever value Bitcoin
[50:50] right so 100 um I like up your game read
[50:56] some great books okay read the book uh
[51:01] um the greatest salesman in the world by
[51:03] a mandino it's this big man I mean it's
[51:06] a tiny little book it's a [ __ ]
[51:09] too okay it's an awesome book and it has
[51:12] nothing to do with
[51:15] sales nothing but it's called the
[51:17] greatest salesman in the world I
[51:18] actually it's a beautiful story about
[51:21] bringing value to the
[51:23] planet um money is not your problem
[51:27] whoever asks that question it is not
[51:28] about the money it's about right here
[51:32] okay and and the way you level up your
[51:35] game you quit treating zeros like
[51:36] they're so
[51:38] important okay you guys get so upset
[51:41] with me because you're like wow he's
[51:43] talking about million dollars man you
[51:45] know why I'm doing that first off that
[51:47] is the way I think okay I I look at
[51:49] million dollar swags of
[51:52] Investments uh I wish I could look at
[51:55] hundreds like ah I ain't looking at
[51:58] million-- Dollar Deals
[51:59] anymore the only difference between me
[52:01] and you is that you and your family
[52:04] agreed that you could only do a $1,000
[52:07] deal or you were only worth a hundred
[52:10] grand okay like I would never get out of
[52:13] bed for 100 grand dude not even CL for
[52:16] 100 grand for a year I would no chance
[52:19] I'm getting out of bed for 10 grand a
[52:22] month uh I am now beginning to place the
[52:25] correct value on my time
[52:28] okay so you guys do stuff for money I do
[52:31] stuff because I enjoy doing
[52:34] it and then when I enjoy doing it I
[52:37] don't really care how much money you're
[52:38] paying me man level up your game quit
[52:41] doing [ __ ] you don't want to do dude for
[52:44] and you're doing only because you're a
[52:46] prostitute at this
[52:48] point I know I know that's sounds harsh
[52:51] but think about it right a bunch of guys
[52:53] follow you so they'll be okay with this
[52:56] once you do a job that you are not built
[52:59] for and you know it dude you go to work
[53:02] every day and you're like I hate this
[53:03] [ __ ] job I don't like him I don't
[53:05] like him well you have become a
[53:08] prostitute because you're not
[53:10] leaving no no I'm going to stay one more
[53:12] day wh why you staying Bob you hate this
[53:14] job I need the money well you're a
[53:17] [ __ ] [ __ ]
[53:18] dude a [ __ ]
[53:21] [ __ ] I mean
[53:23] really right well you don't like that
[53:25] job sh go sell drugs
[53:26] dude go go fly to fly to Hollywood and
[53:29] go meet Diddy he'll pay you some
[53:32] money Diddy I said y y'all don't know
[53:35] what's going on in Hollywood y'all not
[53:37] hearing all this news in
[53:39] Austria no no I yeah okay that's a
[53:42] different story but some of your
[53:44] American audience will get it hey y'all
[53:46] call diddy go get a job you know level
[53:50] up it's so fascinating I I mean I didn't
[53:53] not know that we're going this direction
[53:55] but it's really cool uh because I
[53:57] actually quit my job like not even two
[53:59] months ago because I wanted to Value
[54:03] more time my time and I wanted to do the
[54:05] whole day something that I enjoy and I
[54:07] like and I like talking about Bitcoin I
[54:10] like doing something in the scene and
[54:12] I'm now working probably like 12 hours a
[54:14] day but I don't consider it working it's
[54:17] like I I I enjoy it so much and I made
[54:21] in this two months already the income
[54:23] level that I had before on the job so
[54:25] it's not about money I was so concerned
[54:28] before quitting and bought the money
[54:29] like I it was is breaking my head about
[54:31] I had sleepless nights it was amazing
[54:34] but once I made the step and now I'm in
[54:37] this game and I'm only two months in the
[54:38] game honest honestly it's not long uh
[54:41] and the money is not even uh it does not
[54:43] never come to my my mind it's just like
[54:46] I stand up at 5 in the morning because I
[54:48] love doing what I do and it's now 9:30
[54:52] p.m. so I will be like working from 5:
[54:54] to my maybe like uh 10 or 11 uh making
[54:58] some breaks in between but I I just love
[55:00] doing what I do and and that's that's
[55:02] that's Freedom kind of for me for like
[55:04] as a small example yeah see we're back
[55:06] to the free word what is freedom for you
[55:08] as you asked the question like what's
[55:09] what does freedom uh mean for you
[55:11] freedom for me is really easy to to
[55:14] Define man it it is the ability to say
[55:18] to
[55:19] anything
[55:21] anyone any
[55:24] institution no
[55:28] and to be able to say yes to absolutely
[55:32] anything I want to
[55:33] do I get to say yes and I get to say no
[55:37] and I don't I I am not a [ __ ] I am
[55:41] literally saying yes and no to what I
[55:43] want is a unique creature that has to be
[55:46] ultimate freedom and it has absolutely
[55:49] nothing to do with
[55:50] money because once you take that
[55:54] attack uh last business I
[55:57] had was with a partner of mine and her
[56:00] there is no client I have that is so
[56:03] important that I will not say call out a
[56:07] wrong and like n dude that's I don't
[56:11] want your
[56:12] money okay and there there are clients
[56:15] that will not do business with me
[56:17] because of my views who I vote on my
[56:21] statements
[56:23] um and and that that like see that's not
[56:26] about money because if you make it about
[56:28] money then that's going to be the client
[56:31] you go hey hey nobody say anything okay
[56:32] don't say don't talk about Co [ __ ]
[56:35] covid-19 that was a plan okay you want
[56:38] to cancel me cancel me but I need a big
[56:41] audience of people that go hey why'
[56:43] y'all cancel him dude he didn't say
[56:45] anything he's telling the truth and
[56:48] that's why we need to do this work right
[56:49] now dude because we are going to be
[56:51] censored believe me okay they have to
[56:55] try that
[56:57] they have to try that they cannot allow
[57:00] what the what we're doing here dude I
[57:02] can educate a million people like I have
[57:05] harow to educate large numbers of people
[57:09] in a really common basic way I do not
[57:11] need to have a calculus background I
[57:14] have I have to have good communication
[57:16] skills be authentic and be trusted and
[57:18] have a closet that's so clean nobody can
[57:21] come pick at
[57:22] it uh but yes and no to be able to say
[57:25] yes and no if you guys live your life
[57:26] that way I'm free that is the core to
[57:29] me um I could be worth a lot more money
[57:32] too a lot more money okay I never
[57:36] understood why it need to
[57:38] be like what I don't there's only so
[57:43] much money you can really spend first
[57:45] off um I mean Elon doesn't have a lot of
[57:49] liquid cash is sitting around he's
[57:51] creating things right so I I don't
[57:53] really get the whole holding a bunch of
[57:55] trophies
[57:57] out there uh I have two cars now instead
[58:00] of
[58:02] one and uh I don't need 47 lamborghin
[58:05] lambor Lambos
[58:07] man I don't need to own a
[58:10] house I mean have you ever have you ever
[58:14] walked up to a girl's door that you
[58:16] wanted to go out and have a date
[58:18] with hey Betty how you doing Betty Betty
[58:21] before we go on a date I just need to
[58:22] know do you own this house or do you
[58:25] rent it because if you rent it I'm not
[58:28] really going to take you out like what
[58:31] an
[58:33] [ __ ] does it matter
[58:35] dud because when you take if you're
[58:37] lucky and you take her to the Four
[58:39] Seasons hey knock it off if you take her
[58:42] to the Four Seasons what is she going to
[58:44] look at you and go hey by the way now
[58:45] Robin do you own the Four Seasons or are
[58:48] we renting
[58:50] this see it's so
[58:52] illogical rent of Four Seasons okay buy
[58:57] property lease property out to other
[58:59] people who believe that owning a house
[59:03] you know if they get it this right they
[59:06] want freedom they're going to go rent
[59:08] facilities from you let them rent from
[59:10] you and and you continue to rent and you
[59:13] this is the real estate play you own big
[59:15] pieces of real estate that generate cash
[59:18] flow and then that cash flow goes into
[59:20] Bitcoin uh you don't need to own a home
[59:23] I mean I don't think many people need to
[59:25] own much of anything quite frankly it's
[59:28] fascinating also for me because honestly
[59:30] I own Bitcoin then I own like a laptop a
[59:35] camera a microphone and that's pretty
[59:37] much it like everything else is rented
[59:40] and uh yeah only then other than Bitcoin
[59:43] I don't own anything like if if you take
[59:46] away the Bitcoin like I'm I'm I'm just
[59:50] I'm just me and also and stuff like that
[59:52] but obvious thing uh but other than that
[59:55] I just I just own Bitcoin and it's it's
[59:57] it's uh freeing to a certain extent even
[60:00] like it's really really cool I love that
[60:02] and I also love that that you are
[60:04] thinking uh in in that way um before we
[60:07] come to our end routine um where do you
[60:10] see uh like Bitcoin in the next like 10
[60:12] years what do you expect from Bitcoin
[60:15] from the community what do you expect
[60:17] happening uh with last four years cycle
[60:20] was amazing with like the first publicly
[60:22] traded company the ETFs happening with
[60:24] El Salvador happening uh what what do
[60:27] you anything expect anything from like
[60:29] the next four eight years that uh that
[60:32] is coming
[60:34] um I think it's going to be exciting I
[60:37] mean I think we're going to see
[60:39] adoption
[60:40] uh cool thing is I don't think anybody's
[60:43] going to have to wait four years uh I I
[60:46] would predict
[60:48] by December 31
[60:51] 2024 it's going to be extremely evident
[60:54] to everyone
[60:56] uh what the hell this whole Bitcoin
[60:58] thing's about I think you're going to
[61:00] see demand that even Satoshi didn't even
[61:03] imagine okay like it's the angles on
[61:07] this are so
[61:08] staggering um 48 years eight years it'll
[61:14] be continue to hold the title as the
[61:17] greatest investment in in history after
[61:21] that I'm not so
[61:23] sure um I would I would a look at this
[61:26] as a 4 to eight year hold if you're just
[61:29] looking at Bitcoin I would not come into
[61:31] Bitcoin thinking you're going to buy
[61:32] here and sell in three months the play
[61:35] here is to buy it put it away
[61:39] safely continue to buy it on a daily
[61:43] cost basis monthly cost basis okay this
[61:46] is a a very cool
[61:50] 401K pension retirement program that if
[61:54] you just put it away and let it do the
[61:56] work for you you then go out and do your
[61:59] day job whatever makes you really happy
[62:02] you sitting on a pile of Bitcoin is not
[62:06] your purpose and it is not going to make
[62:09] you free and it's not going to make you
[62:12] happy sitting on a pile of Bitcoin
[62:15] knowing you can say yes and no to
[62:18] helping change the world and have an
[62:20] impact to your buddy hey how do I level
[62:23] up stick your eyeball and your earbuds
[62:27] into this social media world and get to
[62:30] know people like Robin's doing you don't
[62:33] have to do a podcast to to like you can
[62:35] come on one of my ex spaces and join
[62:37] that's a dude there's a community of
[62:39] people why am I I don't even charge I'm
[62:42] trying to bring a community of people in
[62:44] here an army before we get
[62:47] censored okay if you believe game theory
[62:50] is hey they're going to try the censor
[62:52] we better group up really [ __ ] fast
[62:55] and list quit bitching about oh Gary
[62:58] owns Dogecoin I hate him bro I'm in
[63:01] crypto digital Bitcoin I'm a logical
[63:04] human being I have a very very tiny
[63:07] position on some of this other [ __ ] I
[63:09] tell everyone this is not the equivalent
[63:11] to bitcoin it's not the same term I have
[63:14] so much Bitcoin I have more Bitcoin than
[63:16] most of the people listening to this
[63:18] like I'm bleeding Bitcoin at this point
[63:20] so I get to go buy a Dogecoin if I
[63:23] [ __ ] want okay I'm Not An Enemy of
[63:26] the State Jesus Christ I still have US
[63:29] Dollars dude there's a lot of things I
[63:32] have from the analog world okay um
[63:35] Dogecoin I like my thesis on
[63:38] Dogecoin it's a freaking call option on
[63:42] Elon whether he hey if he dies the thing
[63:46] is probably going to be more valuable
[63:48] than if he
[63:49] lives
[63:51] okay like this is the way guys like me
[63:54] look at it [ __ ] [ __ ] do I don't care
[63:56] about the token dude it's it's a put
[63:58] call option it's a call option on his
[64:01] death or his
[64:03] success okay and and and ethereum if if
[64:07] vitalic
[64:08] dies ethereum is not going to have any
[64:10] memorability of
[64:12] value okay I don't I don't get that one
[64:15] okay I own xrp I mean I think it's a
[64:19] [ __ ] stock the price action has been
[64:22] terrible I don't have to talk about the
[64:25] code the stock is gross the price is
[64:28] grossly
[64:29] underperformed but at 56 cents I
[64:32] mean you know could Visa or somebody go
[64:35] in and do something interesting maybe
[64:38] like it's $5,000 position for me dude
[64:41] who cares right wealthy people like me
[64:43] are not going to buy those I'm doing it
[64:46] because I'm in this space
[64:48] man okay like I own some other things I
[64:51] own a million dollars worth of miners I
[64:53] think they've been horrible Investments
[64:56] horrible
[64:58] okay I mean horrible and I actually
[65:00] question hey why why did I do
[65:02] this okay so here I am a seasoned
[65:05] professional man and I'm telling you I
[65:07] am making mistakes well isn't it good
[65:10] that I'm telling you
[65:11] that instead of me hiding cuz I think
[65:15] there's whales out there than pushing
[65:17] the market around for eight years okay
[65:19] [ __ ] washing you guys out and then
[65:21] they talk about how pure they are and
[65:23] then they're lighting up tokens over
[65:24] here
[65:26] so I'm my job is to be transparent and I
[65:29] don't really care if people are total
[65:32] bitcoiners or not total I don't care
[65:34] dude I'm going to tell you what I think
[65:36] and how I deploy my Capital I know
[65:39] people that go into 7-Elevens and Tes go
[65:42] and buy lottery tickets every day okay
[65:46] what's the difference at least the
[65:48] lottery tickets uh got the backing of
[65:51] the United
[65:53] States okay I don't know what but let me
[65:56] pick a coin I don't know what hadera has
[65:59] okay or Richard Hart's coin has I'm not
[66:02] picking on
[66:03] anybody uh but I don't I don't know why
[66:06] I have to go by Richard Hart when he's
[66:09] under SEC perview and probably every
[66:13] other interpole related agency when I
[66:15] can buy Bitcoin and it doesn't have an
[66:18] address or a human being why would I do
[66:20] that man okay if you have been doing it
[66:24] doesn't make it
[66:26] right like it's just you know you I I've
[66:29] been in trades before I go hey this
[66:31] trade's wrong man I I I need to say this
[66:34] trade is wrong it's not performing I'm
[66:36] going to get out I'm not right every
[66:39] time oh what a heavy duty
[66:42] confront right so Freedom right to say
[66:45] yes right to say
[66:47] no we can't possibly be judging people
[66:50] if they're holding on to euros Sterling
[66:52] US Dollars and they're buying Bitcoin
[66:55] and maybe some XYZ coin I don't care
[66:58] let's get them off of the Fiat system
[67:01] okay let's get them in our camp and then
[67:03] we can educate it's hard to educate from
[67:05] outside if bitcoin's for everyone then
[67:07] it needs to be for everyone and we need
[67:10] to be nice to
[67:12] everyone and if bitcoin's really going
[67:14] to fix everything then why would you be
[67:17] worried about a little piece of [ __ ]
[67:20] Pepe coin dude if it's going to fix
[67:22] everything why you worried about a
[67:24] little gat
[67:26] that's going to actually go away one
[67:29] day okay it's going to go away this
[67:31] dominance with Bitcoin do the dominance
[67:34] on bitcoin will continue to go up I
[67:37] think it ends up in the 70s in four
[67:40] years back to your 4 day year Bitcoin
[67:43] ends up being
[67:44] 70 I actually have a higher number but
[67:47] people will say I'm just an idiot but
[67:49] it's in the mid or above 70s we're at
[67:52] 52% right now I know a bunch of sh
[67:55] Bitcoin guys that uh I think that's a
[67:57] horrible term by the way but other coins
[68:00] that they think it's going to be you
[68:02] know Bitcoins at 40% I'm
[68:05] like I don't think so bro Bitcoin has to
[68:08] take more if it's going to compete with
[68:12] gold uh unless that entire token Market
[68:15] goes up and by the way what is that
[68:17] token Market Does it include
[68:19] coinbase a micro
[68:21] strategy Does it include those it should
[68:24] because I'll tell you something if
[68:26] you're invested in some of these other
[68:27] companies and you didn't invest in micro
[68:28] strategy that was a [ __ ] horrible
[68:31] tradeit micro strategy was a great
[68:35] token right like really except it's not
[68:38] a token I I own a company called node 40
[68:42] people go hey what's the best project
[68:43] you see man what's dude node 40 is the
[68:45] best project I know of no that's not a
[68:48] token you asked me about the best
[68:51] project when did y'all start redefining
[68:54] the word project in business to oh it's
[68:57] got to be a
[68:58] token like wow
[69:01] hello I mean if this was a token
[69:03] business it'd be worth a billion dollars
[69:06] it generates cash it has some of the
[69:08] best Blue Chip customers on the
[69:11] planet I'm trying to raise money at 50
[69:13] to100 million and people are going oh
[69:16] nah I'm going to go buy this poopy coin
[69:19] uh launch it CU a bunch of idiots are
[69:22] going to buy it Pump It Up allow me to
[69:24] get out real quick
[69:26] and show a $3 billion valuation on a
[69:28] company that's never done
[69:30] anything like I I don't get that okay
[69:32] I'm building picks and shovels in the in
[69:35] in this industry picks and shovels that
[69:38] is things that the analog industry
[69:40] needed has always needed and just
[69:43] because they're going to digital doesn't
[69:44] mean they're not going to need all
[69:46] exactly those same tools reporting
[69:49] analytics views systems they need all of
[69:53] that and analog cannot
[69:55] deal with digital so we're gonna have to
[69:58] build it all from
[70:00] scratch and that is an awesome
[70:03] opportunity and and and you know eight
[70:06] years from now I mean I think it's
[70:08] pretty cool that Bitcoin that there are
[70:10] other solutions that are competing with
[70:13] Bitcoin because I don't think bitcoin's
[70:15] ready to go
[70:18] mainstream okay so what you need is I
[70:21] have never been first in any business
[70:23] I've ever built I actually would not buy
[70:26] invest in or build a business that was
[70:29] first I wouldn't do
[70:31] it very few companies that do first
[70:35] actually end up first
[70:37] last me meaning over a period of time
[70:39] they end up losing their Prime position
[70:42] because they were the target to hit see
[70:45] that's why I'm always like I want to
[70:46] become the gold standard because that
[70:49] makes everybody go pushed toward the go
[70:51] gold standard and most people don't have
[70:53] the they want to cut cut
[70:56] Corners so uh being first dude I mean I
[71:00] think Bitcoin however will be the only
[71:03] first that really makes this because of
[71:05] its
[71:07] unique qualities of which there's about
[71:09] 13 or 14 and we only are for here about
[71:12] two or three of those qualities some of
[71:14] the qualities of Bitcoin that are never
[71:16] mentioned for me are so
[71:19] valuable uh for whole different podcast
[71:22] show but uh when you really go through
[71:26] the characteristics of Bitcoin both
[71:28] positive and negative and you weigh it
[71:29] up again you do a SWAT analysis against
[71:31] other asset it become so clear have you
[71:35] ever seen anyone do it that
[71:37] way no just
[71:41] man immutable codes algorithms Satoshi
[71:47] there's four words I don't even
[71:49] understand okay instead of going hey
[71:51] let's just measure these two things
[71:52] pluses and minuses
[71:55] you know it's kind of hard to move 3600
[71:58] doors of real estate from one state to
[72:01] another I've never seen that happen it's
[72:04] really hard to do it without a sales
[72:06] agent involved that's 6%
[72:10] 3% near impossible to do without a bank
[72:13] so you just go through the whole thing
[72:15] right
[72:17] um I think it's an awesome time to be
[72:19] alive and anyone trying to level up
[72:22] their game they should read the white
[72:23] paper they should start following Robin
[72:26] follow me and then follow people that
[72:29] follow people that you
[72:31] trust okay and and like on the the heavy
[72:36] duty warning just because somebody's on
[72:38] TV doesn't make them nice or
[72:43] right okay it doesn't make them nice or
[72:46] right you don't know what their agenda
[72:47] is okay I would actually do some
[72:50] research and when you look at one of
[72:52] these influencers and you can't figure
[72:54] out has he ever made any
[72:56] money you might want to ask yourself why
[72:59] you're listening to someone where you
[73:01] can't go hey I'm quite certain he is a
[73:03] wealthy
[73:05] man okay or woman like he has made it
[73:09] dude or he's got 30 million followers I
[73:11] mean there has to be stats that you look
[73:13] at and go really dude is there's going
[73:15] to be a lot of
[73:17] fakers that pop up here okay they're
[73:20] predators and uh just be careful who you
[73:24] choose but there's a lot of resources to
[73:27] dig into man it's it's it's so
[73:31] exciting yeah I was saying in the
[73:33] podcast what a time to be alive it's
[73:35] like the internet Revolution the digital
[73:37] Revolution Bitcoin everything is just
[73:39] right starting right now this is this is
[73:41] a one and a century event man a one in a
[73:45] century okay like
[73:47] like this will never come across this
[73:50] this this will come and go and there are
[73:53] going to be massive amounts of people
[73:55] that are left out in the
[73:57] coal and it's because you refuse to get
[74:00] your head out of your ass okay like you
[74:03] have to be willing to look at some of
[74:04] this this is a massive massive step
[74:08] change and those that are exposed are
[74:11] 22 to 62 years old it is a large ban of
[74:16] people that I'm going to end with this
[74:19] and it let you do the closing but if
[74:22] you're if you're in a job and you don't
[74:26] know what value you bring to that job
[74:29] you should start looking for a new job
[74:32] it's a one or two sentences this is what
[74:34] I do and it's
[74:36] impart furthermore if you're working for
[74:38] a company and you cannot identify what
[74:41] it is you do that company does that
[74:43] brings value to the world not in a bunch
[74:45] of Cody Cody boo boo blah blah language
[74:48] but like hey this is what we do we're
[74:51] IBM and we solve you know trillion
[74:53] dollar M you know what whatever I'd
[74:56] start looking for another platform to
[74:58] work from man your platform must add
[75:00] value in the future there is not going
[75:03] to be any more parasites middlemen
[75:07] commissions
[75:09] pimps okay that's all they are do
[75:11] they're pimps okay agencies affiliate
[75:14] fees all the string of players getting
[75:17] sitting at the the food
[75:19] trough taking but not bringing
[75:23] delivering value uh um that that's what
[75:26] that's how you level up you figure out
[75:29] how do you bring value to someone and
[75:32] people that are really smart D like we
[75:35] don't care what we pay people we care
[75:38] where the value is and like I don't I do
[75:42] not get I do not Chase two cents a
[75:45] gallon discounts
[75:48] okay I mean I don't care about I
[75:51] actually would prefer to pay more like I
[75:53] I got on Twitter
[75:56] uh the day that Elon started charging
[75:59] for it the day he bought it he started
[76:02] charging I
[76:04] me um I would pay for everything too if
[76:07] you guys are in the system you should
[76:08] start paying for what you're doing pay
[76:11] Robin a dollar dude we've never had this
[76:14] conversation [ __ ] pay him three bucks
[76:16] a month okay like what do you think he's
[76:18] going to do that he you have to feed
[76:22] him okay like I want want to hire eight
[76:25] more people here like I'm getting ready
[76:27] to bring a comedian on my team because I
[76:29] think there's a lot of jokes to tell
[76:31] about finance and Bitcoin and lighten it
[76:34] up like I'm trying to use this
[76:36] technology to educate and the education
[76:39] has to be funner than what you and I did
[76:41] in school and it should be dude I don't
[76:44] know why they [ __ ] up education so
[76:47] badly like I would have been a great
[76:49] teacher you come to my chemistry class
[76:51] we're going to have fun dude we're going
[76:52] to blow [ __ ] up and and right it's going
[76:56] to be exciting man but there's going to
[76:58] be some rules you're two seconds late
[77:00] you're not coming in my room and if you
[77:03] don't do your homework get get the hell
[77:04] out of my my my room dude come on so
[77:08] give to Robin find people you can
[77:10] support man and then stop spending money
[77:13] with your [ __ ]
[77:15] enemy there's a lot of enemies you're
[77:18] supporting if you're not supporting
[77:20] Robin again we have never spoken okay if
[77:24] you're sitting there is taken from Robin
[77:26] there's a part of you that knows hey I'm
[77:28] taking more than I'm giving send the guy
[77:30] 50 cents okay like and the reason for
[77:33] that is you're gonna feel good about it
[77:35] oh wow Robin had Cardone on I'm a pro
[77:38] see I always go longer than people ask
[77:40] me to
[77:41] go I always ask hey what's your audience
[77:43] like man like you you heard me ask you
[77:46] that question because I'm interested in
[77:47] being relevant for your why are we going
[77:49] to waste an
[77:50] hour right
[77:52] um but but but and then and then just
[77:55] find people that you can get help
[77:59] from uh learn right and and and that
[78:02] Community will get bigger and
[78:04] bigger uh safer and safer and that's
[78:08] where your leverage comes from and for
[78:12] you know you you guys should be probably
[78:14] paying maybe eight different people on
[78:17] these
[78:18] podcast 20 bucks here five bucks there
[78:22] and get off of all
[78:25] media get off all other media man stop
[78:29] watching
[78:30] CNN okay the guy gets paid $6 million a
[78:33] year you think he's going to tell you
[78:35] the
[78:35] truth okay do I look like I have a
[78:38] script
[78:39] here okay Robin knows how to talk from
[78:43] something other than a
[78:45] teleprompter okay he's not being told oh
[78:49] he asked me hey man are there any
[78:51] questions that I can't ask you no bro
[78:53] whatever you need to ask you
[78:56] uh but if if if you're getting your news
[78:58] from sources that are making half a
[78:59] million dollars to 20 30 40 million
[79:03] dollars a year you got to kind of ask
[79:05] yourself hey what what exactly did those
[79:08] people
[79:09] do hold on one
[79:11] second Scott I'm just finishing up you
[79:14] are you here you get my point so so uh
[79:17] support Robin there's a lot of great
[79:19] people out there guys and and
[79:22] uh next five years a lot of wealth is
[79:25] gonna make be made and wealth is not
[79:27] just money it's like connections
[79:29] connections are more valuable to me than
[79:31] the
[79:32] [Music]
[79:33] Bitcoin 100% it's it's amazing it's it's
[79:38] a pleasure talking with you and it's a
[79:39] pleasure having the podcast with you we
[79:42] have end routine really quickly where
[79:44] the previous guest is asking a question
[79:46] for the next guest uh and your question
[79:49] uh from the last guest was about the
[79:51] lightning Network how do you see the
[79:52] lightning Network playing out uh and I
[79:55] always have those questions where the
[79:57] previous guest does not know who the
[79:59] next guest is so it's like like a Rand
[80:02] I'm not going to answer the lightning
[80:03] thing I actually find the light whole
[80:05] lightning conversation a little weird uh
[80:09] and and
[80:11] uh I could go both ways on it look
[80:13] there's going to be some some uh layers
[80:16] here I think and some of those players
[80:19] will work and some of them may or may
[80:21] not work and some of them will
[80:23] completely fail I don't know enough
[80:25] about lightning to light lightning does
[80:27] not have to work for Bitcoin to be
[80:30] important in fact I could say lightning
[80:32] could fall apart tomorrow morning and
[80:34] bitcoin's going to still be a
[80:36] monster so I don't even care 100% okay
[80:39] because I actually don't think the
[80:41] peer-to-peer look you guys I gotta tell
[80:44] you okay if you're using Bitcoin to buy
[80:46] potato chips you're an
[80:48] idiot I'll tell every Bitcoin on the
[80:51] planet you're a [ __ ] idiot no I'm
[80:54] reasing the skids I I I I'm helping move
[80:58] the system dude you do not help the
[81:00] system move a $1.95 by getting rid of
[81:03] Bitcoin and then they look at me and go
[81:05] hey by the way I went and bought it back
[81:06] that same moment well what exactly did
[81:09] you did except change your tax
[81:12] position like what are you doing dude
[81:14] okay I have never used a gold bar to do
[81:17] anything under

[83:00] these shall we call it entertainment
[83:03] education whatever we're calling this uh
[83:06] and it's it's it it has to be with
[83:11] respect okay I like I am not running
[83:15] these rooms that are full of drama I
[83:20] will rarely be talking about Israel and
[83:23] Palestine who's right and wrong you're
[83:25] both [ __ ] wrong okay everybody's
[83:28] wrong in the whole deal okay the US
[83:30] government's wrong on it any tax dollars
[83:33] that went to support either one of those
[83:35] [ __ ] groups is wrong I wish I didn't
[83:38] have any of my I it's all wrong okay so
[83:41] there is no Jews you are not right and
[83:44] Palestine you're not right I'll say now
[83:46] did everybody wants to hate on me
[83:48] [ __ ] hate on me okay it's not cool
[83:50] dude we're human
[83:52] beings okay I did not get
[83:55] birthed under the Catholic symbol just
[83:57] because I was Italian and I'm like some
[84:00] special human being I am a [ __ ] human
[84:03] being okay period I happen to own
[84:06] Bitcoin I belong to no religion because
[84:09] they've all let me down and it saddens
[84:12] me that they've all let me down okay I
[84:14] did not want to be let down by religion
[84:16] but I have been let down by multiple
[84:18] religions they all seem to go
[84:20] crazy and funny enough I end up in
[84:23] Bitcoin
[84:25] which is bringing together a very large
[84:28] population of people whether you like
[84:30] them or not from all walks of
[84:33] life that you and I are literally not we
[84:36] would not be having this podcast if it
[84:38] wasn't for this one
[84:41] conversation and it's Bitcoin and I
[84:43] think Bitcoin has some religious
[84:46] spiritual elements to it that very few
[84:49] people
[84:50] discuss and more importantly very few
[84:53] people can articulate in a way that's
[84:55] not
[84:56] weird so I actually look at Bitcoin as a
[85:00] little bit of my way of getting my
[85:03] spiritual needs met that are not
[85:07] received I can't find them in a church
[85:10] and dude I have tried some Churches okay
[85:12] like five or six of them I've studied a
[85:14] lot of
[85:15] religion um and there's something
[85:18] beautiful that's going on around Bitcoin
[85:20] especially if the people they're talking
[85:22] about it aren't psychotic
[85:26] um that that if we start thinking about
[85:30] hey what do you and I what can you and I
[85:33] agree
[85:34] on okay like I don't have a I don't have
[85:37] a beard and a
[85:38] mustache okay maybe I should not like
[85:40] guys with beards and mustaches okay
[85:43] instead I'm
[85:45] like you know he he's a Bitcoin guy dude
[85:49] what's oh wow he likes that freedom
[85:51] thing okay so we have those two things
[85:52] in common now I can worry about not how
[85:55] you're different how about hey how are
[85:58] we
[85:59] similar like what do we share in common
[86:01] that we can expound on expand on instead
[86:05] of going ah he's Jewish man and I'm not
[86:09] so [ __ ] him that's ridiculous we're
[86:12] human beings thank you sir very true
[86:14] perfect uh I mean that was amazing thank
