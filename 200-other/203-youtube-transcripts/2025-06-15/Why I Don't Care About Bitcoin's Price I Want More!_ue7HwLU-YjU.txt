[00:00] because I know that like my Bitcoin is
[00:02] it's not for sale and so the price is
[00:05] irrelevant to me. What people don't
[00:07] understand is I don't want to sell my
[00:09] Bitcoin because I want to hold on to it
[00:11] cuz I value it. So yeah, I'm just a a
[00:14] bluecollar fiat miner who saves in
[00:18] perfect money, buy Bitcoin on a a
[00:20] regular basis and told storage it and
[00:22] and that's and then I live my life. I
[00:24] got a friend of mine who ask me all the
[00:26] time. He's like, "Ed, when are we going
[00:27] to, you know, a 500k?" I'm like, "I
[00:30] don't care."
[00:33] [Music]
[00:35] Come on again. It's It's really cool.
[00:39] I'm happy to. I had fun last time even
[00:42] though I was like
[00:45] uh nervous and reluctant, you know. Uh
[00:48] obviously like whenever I'm I'm asked to
[00:51] do like any sort of public
[00:56] speaking with this speech impediment I'm
[01:00] always a little uh reluctant and nervous
[01:02] too. But then every single time at the
[01:05] end of it I'm like I got to do this more
[01:07] often. This was so much fun.
[01:10] Is it actually is it getting better if
[01:12] you you speak more or is it just
[01:14] something that like uh is is is not uh
[01:18] developing in any source? Um honestly
[01:22] it's like every day is different day
[01:25] like I get up some days and some days
[01:28] it's like really really hard to talk at
[01:31] all. Um uh other days it's like uh uh
[01:36] flowing uh smoothly and and you know
[01:39] some people would
[01:41] like question um if I was actually uh
[01:45] faking it or not. Um but no I think
[01:49] uh today's an okay day.
[01:52] So let's see what happens today. Yeah.
[01:55] You know so I mean like you know what
[01:56] like like last time too like we just
[01:58] yapped last time. last time we were just
[02:00] like we were just yapping about stuff
[02:02] and I think it's like interesting
[02:05] nowadays because I was like I was like I
[02:07] didn't really tell him like my story
[02:10] like of like how I I got
[02:13] into Bitcoin and like like like the
[02:16] journey of it. And I realize now I mean
[02:19] it was like a year ago right? And um I
[02:23] realize now like I was like still in the
[02:26] beginning phases of
[02:28] my a
[02:30] a journey and you know and now like I'm
[02:32] sure in like I 10 years I'll look back
[02:36] now and and uh feel the same way
[02:40] [Music]
[02:41] about where I'm at now. But like, but
[02:45] now I can I can look back with
[02:48] some perspective and say like I was
[02:52] convicted back then like I was um pretty
[02:56] I had 100% of my net worth in Bitcoin
[03:00] then or maybe like 95% but um but like
[03:04] my conviction rate has gone up
[03:07] tremendously
[03:09] uh since then you know I don't even
[03:12] think about Bitcoin that much anymore or
[03:16] I should say that I don't think about
[03:20] everything around it now. I I just think
[03:26] about the network like I don't know how
[03:30] much uh Bitcoin
[03:35] is trading for uh right now.
[03:39] believe it's in like the 80s or
[03:41] something like that, but like I don't uh
[03:44] actively look at the price all day
[03:46] anymore. Like I used to uh uh you know
[03:51] what I was going to ask you to, but I
[03:54] don't care what the price is to be
[03:56] honest with you. I've come so far like
[03:59] in the the beginning I was obsessed with
[04:03] the price and that was the only way that
[04:05] I could really value this thing was by
[04:08] how much somebody else who I didn't know
[04:15] was selling it for uh to somebody else
[04:19] who I didn't know. And like now I don't
[04:23] care about the the price anymore because
[04:26] I know that like my Bitcoin is not for
[04:29] sale. And so the price is irrelevant to
[04:34] me. You know, it's like if if if you had
[04:37] a Corvette in your driveway and and
[04:40] somebody came up to you and was like,
[04:42] "How much they're selling that for?" And
[04:44] you're like, "Oh, no. It's not for
[04:45] sale." Like I I love this car. He's
[04:48] like, "Okay, well if I gave you like a
[04:50] hundred grand for it." He'd be like,
[04:51] "No, it's not for sale." Like, "What if
[04:53] I give you a million for it?" Like,
[04:54] "It's not for sale, you know, and like
[04:57] you keep filling up with the price." But
[04:59] like what people don't understand is I
[05:02] don't want to sell my Bitcoin because I
[05:05] want to hold on to it because I value it
[05:09] that much now. And in the the beginning,
[05:14] even like a year ago, I would have sold
[05:17] it for, you know, a million bucks or,
[05:20] you know, something like
[05:23] that. It's super interesting. I I it's
[05:26] so funny because I had literally this
[05:28] thought today and I wrote a tweet about
[05:31] that today that will come out in a in a
[05:33] few days but I I I put it in my draft
[05:36] today because a lot of precoiners or
[05:39] even like uh bitcoiners that are in the
[05:42] first year they ask me or I see them
[05:46] asking other people oh like what what do
[05:48] you think the price will be or where is
[05:50] the bitcoin price right now or and for
[05:53] example I was at the doctor's today at
[05:55] the dentist. Uh and uh and he was asking
[05:59] me, "Oh, like what do you do?" And I was
[06:00] like, "Oh, like [ __ ] what what should I
[06:02] say? Should I say that? I have a podcast
[06:03] about Bitcoin. Uh this uh gives up a
[06:06] whole different vibes." But I said like,
[06:08] "Oh, I have a Bitcoin podcast." And he's
[06:10] like, "Oh, interesting. How is it going
[06:12] with with with Bitcoin now? I I heard
[06:14] Trump is not good with it now now
[06:16] again." H and and I was like, "Ah, it
[06:19] doesn't matter what Trump does for
[06:20] Bitcoin." And he's like, "What?" Uh, and
[06:22] he asked me about the price and stuff
[06:24] like that. And I said to him, I I I
[06:27] don't know exactly what the price
[06:28] actually is. I I just know it's probably
[06:32] around like 100k something something
[06:34] along those lines, but I don't know
[06:36] exactly. And this is what what people
[06:40] outside don't get. If you are if you
[06:42] actually get
[06:44] Bitcoin, the daily price doesn't matter.
[06:47] I might look it up. If a lot of people
[06:50] are talk about it and it shoots up to
[06:52] like 200, 300, 400,000, then like it
[06:55] gets interesting to to to check it. But
[06:57] also just for short term, but honestly,
[07:00] like right now, I don't know if I
[07:03] guessed it's probably between 80 and
[07:05] 90,000, but uh I didn't know. I I only
[07:08] check it if someone puts it on on
[07:10] Twitter on my Twitter feed. Me, too.
[07:13] Yeah. Yeah. I I only see the price when
[07:16] a friend of mine I sends me like a
[07:21] screenshot like look I b I got it at
[07:25] 76k. I'm like wow that's so cheap right
[07:27] now. That's crazy. Um but yeah it's like
[07:30] it's it's just like it's like like if
[07:32] you own a home you're not going to check
[07:36] the a value of your home. Also, it's
[07:40] like I can't check the value of my
[07:43] Bitcoin. I can only check the value of
[07:46] somebody else's Bitcoin that they've
[07:48] sold. It's not it's not actually
[07:51] reflective of the the value of my coins.
[07:58] I mean, like there's there's a
[08:00] fungeability here, right? Like it's not
[08:02] like houses where like if like if like
[08:04] you know your neighbor sells a house but
[08:07] like he doesn't have a garage so it's
[08:10] not exactly the same price as your house
[08:13] is with a garage. You know the the
[08:16] fungeability makes it seem like all the
[08:19] coins are the same uh value. But I know
[08:23] I know
[08:24] many many hodlers who uh who who
[08:28] understand that that their coins are
[08:31] like the they're all worth $100 million
[08:34] each. Yeah. It's there's also this those
[08:36] those huddle waves and and how long
[08:38] people already uh hold on to Bitcoin.
[08:41] And I'm so fascinated and so humbled by
[08:45] the people that you see on chain that
[08:48] held Bitcoin for 10 years and never
[08:49] moved it anywhere. I'm like, did he lose
[08:52] the access to it? So, like 10 years is a
[08:55] long time to to just be in Bitcoin and
[08:58] never move it. Don't do anything with
[08:59] it. The discipline to hodddle it's an
[09:03] it's an underappreciated skill to to
[09:05] have to not do anything fancy. Don't
[09:08] don't borrow it out. Don't don't don't
[09:11] try to trade it, sell it and and stuff
[09:13] like that. Like I I really I admire the
[09:16] OGs that are in for like 10 years plus.
[09:19] Yeah, absolutely. And you know what? It
[09:22] absolutely is a a deal too uh to hodddle
[09:27] it because I think it's just
[09:29] like kind of human nature to assume that
[09:33] we should be doing more. We should be
[09:36] being more productive with
[09:39] our our money, right? Like that's like a
[09:42] fiat mindset though is like I've got to
[09:44] put this money to work for me. I've
[09:47] gotta uh force this money to create a
[09:51] yield for me. And like that's like it's
[09:54] just it's just fiat thinking because
[09:58] that money's broken. And so like you
[10:01] need it to do more than it naturally
[10:06] does on its own. You know, I I'm like I
[10:10] was just talking to my girlfriend
[10:14] recently about how I'm so glad like I
[10:17] don't have to think about retiring from
[10:21] my current job and like opening up
[10:25] something else after
[10:28] this. Like I don't want to do that. I'm
[10:31] not like
[10:33] entrepreneurial. I don't want to build a
[10:36] business. I'm not like I just certainly
[10:39] don't want to stare at a screen all day
[10:43] and I trade assets. Like that's not what
[10:47] I want. Um and so like I'm just so
[10:50] grateful that I have
[10:53] this money that just that's more
[10:55] valuable over time and so I don't have
[10:58] to play these uh fiat games anymore. And
[11:01] so that that is really where if you
[11:04] understand that then like hodddling
[11:06] isn't really that hard because I am
[11:09] being
[11:11] productive by not doing anything at all
[11:16] you know and I you know what the other
[11:18] thing too where then you were saying
[11:20] that I was thinking about you know how
[11:22] people estimate that there's like uh 5
[11:25] million lost coins or so. I don't think
[11:28] so. I think there's a lot less because
[11:30] how many
[11:32] times do we see a coins move from you
[11:37] know
[11:39] 2011 2012 that we thought
[11:43] were lost and they consolidate their
[11:48] TXOs you know I I remember last year I
[11:52] think we moved $180 million worth
[11:56] consolidated through TXOs and they were
[11:59] all uh 50 block uh 50 coin mining
[12:04] rewards. Like I think there's a lot of
[12:07] that. I I think there's a lot of
[12:10] people hodddling coins from back in the
[12:13] day who are just who understand this
[12:16] thing like as much as you
[12:18] know anybody else does. I think it's a
[12:23] little shortsighted to assume that all
[12:26] of the OG
[12:28] hodddlers are selling at
[12:32] 100K. And it's that is super interesting
[12:36] because it's also there's a little bit
[12:39] of an echo in there. Is that an echo?
[12:41] No, no, there's no echo. Sorry.
[12:44] there there was some some small things
[12:46] and but it's super interesting when when
[12:49] we look at exactly the the the periods
[12:53] of where people sell and you're 100%
[12:55] right with the lost bitcoin because even
[12:58] if you declare something officially lost
[13:00] like what does that mean like someone
[13:03] can say yeah I lost my 25 bitcoin or my
[13:07] 100 bitcoin and maybe it also never
[13:09] moved but there's no proof that he
[13:13] actually lost like you can never prove
[13:15] that someone lost something because
[13:17] maybe he just save saves his uh uh
[13:22] backup keys, his seat phrases in his his
[13:25] mind and that's the only where place
[13:27] where it is. So the the 4 million, 5
[13:31] million, 6 million Bitcoin lost, it's
[13:33] just an estimate because we really don't
[13:35] know how how many of those are actually
[13:37] lost because someone could even claim
[13:39] they lost and then they aren't. So, uh
[13:42] maybe there's just like really hardcore
[13:45] really hardcore hodlers. Maybe
[13:47] interesting because you said like uh uh
[13:50] uh with with your feed m I think you're
[13:52] one of the really hard feared miners out
[13:55] there that that stacks really hard. Um
[13:57] maybe you can tell us a little bit um uh
[14:00] about yourself. What are you doing? And
[14:01] and and for the people that don't know
[14:04] know about you. Yeah, fiat mining means
[14:07] that I have a a job. Um, which used to
[14:13] be common place, but I guess nowadays
[14:16] most people are just podcast host,
[14:19] right? But that is a a job in itself.
[14:21] I'm sure I'm sure it is a job. No, but
[14:24] um yeah, I'm a
[14:26] uh a long shoreman. Um so we're
[14:30] responsible for all the uh marine cargo
[14:34] handling. So pretty much anything that
[14:36] comes on a ship that gets moved by a
[14:40] ship has to be carried on or off that
[14:44] ship by a long shoreman. Um, and so I'm
[14:47] a uh I'm a machine operator. And so I'm
[14:51] just responsible for moving containers
[14:53] around all day uh with
[14:55] my big old uh $4 million machine that's
[15:00] like a big Tonka truck. Um, so I like it
[15:03] because it's kind of like in between
[15:06] like a a skill craft and just a like a
[15:12] dumb man's, you know, do the same thing
[15:15] over and over and over again all day.
[15:19] Um, and I like that actually because I I
[15:21] like to get good at things. I like to
[15:25] become really proficient at things that
[15:28] I do. And so if I if I repeat the same
[15:32] task over and over and over again, which
[15:35] I have
[15:36] for 11 years almost now, um
[15:40] you you start to get pretty good at it.
[15:43] Um and so I, you know, I consider myself
[15:45] a like a skilled laborer um who does a
[15:50] job that very a few people uh can do
[15:53] anymore. Um and uh yeah, I I I you know,
[15:57] I'm I'm I do well there and I have some
[16:00] job security there. So I don't feel the
[16:03] the need to do all this uh financial
[16:06] engineering um that everybody else is
[16:09] like obsessed with now. So I'm I'm I'm
[16:12] very fortunate uh for that fact
[16:15] actually. Um I think that that like the
[16:18] like obsession with uh financial
[16:21] engineering and the like over
[16:23] financialization of of our our
[16:26] whole civilization at least in the
[16:29] western world um is just a result of the
[16:35] a fiat landscape and the corruption of
[16:39] our financial system. It's
[16:42] like the money is is broken and so
[16:47] everybody has to figure out a way to
[16:50] turn their money into more money. And uh
[16:53] that's not the way that that human
[16:55] beings were they're meant to live. Like
[16:58] they're not meant to like be on your
[17:01] your [ __ ] Robin Hood app all day long
[17:04] looking at [ __ ] docks and [ __ ] Like
[17:07] that's not how human beings are supposed
[17:08] to live. And like, you know, people
[17:11] always say like I'm like a fiat minor
[17:13] and like, oh, like Eddie has a job. Like
[17:16] that's how he he uh acquires his
[17:20] Bitcoin. And I'm just like that's how
[17:22] normal people live. They, you know, you
[17:26] go to work and and you save money.
[17:29] That's all I do. I'm not
[17:31] an investor. I'm not um I don't have a
[17:37] financial background. I don't I you know
[17:40] anything that I I understand about
[17:44] finances now which is you know so much
[17:46] more than I understood 5 years ago is
[17:49] all the result of like me going
[17:53] through the
[17:56] Bitcoin our journey you know and like
[18:00] just you know like oh like I don't know
[18:04] what this means like I don't know what
[18:07] bonds are. And so like now I have to
[18:10] learn about bonds. Like I don't know
[18:12] what this means. I I you know it's like
[18:14] just I only know this stuff because
[18:19] Bitcoin led me there, you know. So yeah,
[18:22] I'm just a a bluecollar fiat miner who
[18:27] saves in perfect money. I love that
[18:30] because
[18:32] it's I I probably talked about that uh
[18:36] um in in previous podcasts, but when I
[18:39] started, I was obsessed with stocks. So,
[18:42] I was I was coming from that stock
[18:43] world. I was coming I was one of those
[18:45] finance pros, those stock pros before
[18:48] Bitcoin and I did all the financial
[18:51] engineering that I could do with my
[18:53] small portfolio. It was like almost
[18:56] laughable what I had back back then. And
[19:00] um the funny thing is I was for my small
[19:04] thing kind of successful in the eyes of
[19:07] of my my friends and they're like oh
[19:09] like what are you doing there? And and
[19:12] uh and also for aunts and uncles they
[19:14] came oh like what are you doing there?
[19:15] And I and I actually started trying to
[19:18] teach people how to pick stocks, but
[19:21] what they actually just wanted is how to
[19:24] save money. Like that's what the the
[19:26] answers they did not wanted to hear that
[19:29] they have to listen to 10 cues and 10k
[19:32] reports on quarterly calls of conference
[19:34] calls of of companies and dig into that.
[19:37] Um it that that's not what they want to
[19:40] spend their free time on. They just want
[19:42] to provide value for a community.
[19:45] however you want to do that with like
[19:47] job with like feiat mining how we call a
[19:50] job nowadays and and and all those
[19:53] things. Um and then uh spend time with
[19:57] the family work out and and and and
[19:59] those things. And this is basically the
[20:02] the Bitcoin dream like we we uh we we
[20:05] talk about the American dream. I think
[20:06] like like that that could be called the
[20:08] the Bitcoin dream. You just provide
[20:10] value for the community. the value that
[20:13] you get back from the community, you
[20:14] save in Bitcoin and you live your life.
[20:16] Like it's so simple. I actually um I
[20:20] never told that on on the podcast. I
[20:23] thought a lot about this year because I
[20:25] have I I have because of my Bitcoin
[20:27] income, I have to either spend my
[20:30] Bitcoin or financial engineer my Bitcoin
[20:32] so I can spend fiat. And I decided to
[20:35] just spend my Bitcoin. I just decided to
[20:39] not do anything with with that. I I I
[20:42] have an bigger income than expenses. As
[20:45] long as this is the case, I can save
[20:48] every month. And so yes, I spend Bitcoin
[20:52] now. I sell Bitcoin now because I have
[20:54] to fuel my life. I have to fuel my
[20:56] business. So I don't do any depths. I
[20:59] don't do any credits. I don't do any on
[21:02] any of those
[21:03] things. And the simple reason was for
[21:06] me, I want to sleep at night and don't
[21:09] worry about that thing. I just I just
[21:11] want to do my podcast and and and that's
[21:14] it. Like I don't want to care about and
[21:16] I know a lot of people probably uh can
[21:19] can give me the calculation why it's a
[21:22] bad financial idea, but I don't care
[21:24] about that. I I just want to I just want
[21:26] to do a podcast.
[21:28] Yeah, the there's definitely something
[21:30] to be said about the the cost of like
[21:35] having to think about all this stuff,
[21:37] you know, and having to like look at a
[21:39] screen and like, you know, I know I know
[21:41] like, you know, for for some people who
[21:43] just enjoy that stuff, like if if you're
[21:46] like a a financial engineer and you
[21:50] enjoy this [ __ ] then like awesome, you
[21:52] know? But like I don't enjoy that at
[21:54] all, you know? I'm I'm I'm interested in
[21:58] it enough to like learn about it and to
[22:01] see
[22:02] like where the opportunities are and
[22:05] to pay attention to the space and as as
[22:11] certain products evolve over time like
[22:14] I'll be paying attention to it you know
[22:17] and you know and if the the right
[22:19] opportunity presents itself like I'll
[22:22] take advantage of it but like as of now
[22:24] like there's there's nothing out there
[22:26] now that I'm like oo that wow what a
[22:28] good good opportunity the only thing
[22:30] would be like you know when it's still
[22:33] something that I'm learning about but it
[22:35] would be like uh the micro strategy the
[22:38] uh the the fixed income product
[22:42] uh strike um you know I'm like
[22:46] oh that seems interesting that seems
[22:48] like a good play but again it's not
[22:50] something that like I understand enough
[22:52] to to to get into And it's, you know,
[22:56] and I'm like, I don't want to I don't
[22:57] want to to learn about this. You know,
[23:00] the other day when I was I was at my job
[23:02] and I overheard these guys talking about
[23:08] stocks and they were saying how you have
[23:09] to buy the dip. And I'm just sitting
[23:12] there like I'm just sitting there like
[23:14] I'm like I'm not going to say anything
[23:15] because I've learn I'm I'm past the the
[23:20] Bitcoin evangelist phase too where like
[23:23] you know I've got to tell everybody
[23:24] about this and everybody's going to
[23:26] learn about this and like anything else
[23:27] that you do is [ __ ] and like you've
[23:29] got to you got to put all your money
[23:31] into this right now. like the system's
[23:33] about to collapse and like all of that
[23:36] may still be true, but um I'm not the
[23:40] guy who's going to uh tell
[23:43] everybody that anymore. So, I'm just
[23:46] listening to these
[23:47] guys talking about, you know, about, you
[23:51] know, the one guy's like they're about
[23:53] Apple and he's like, "Yeah, Apple's
[23:55] good." And like the other guy's like,
[23:56] "What about Nvidia?" He's like, "Yeah,
[23:58] Nvidia is good. Yeah, yeah, yeah." He
[24:00] goes, "Oh, okay. Okay. How about Amazon?
[24:02] He goes, "That's a good one. Yeah, you
[24:04] should." I'm like, I'm like, and like
[24:05] I'm sitting. I'm like, just just get
[24:08] them all. Get all
[24:10] of the mag seven. They're all good to
[24:13] go. They're all the same thing. They all
[24:16] represent 90% of the gains in the S&P
[24:20] anyway. Like just Yeah. All of them.
[24:22] They're all good. It's all the same
[24:23] thing. But, you know, I'm just like,
[24:27] "Okay, guys." And then it's interesting
[24:30] how they're not uh talking about
[24:33] strategy, you know, like I wanted to say
[24:35] like how about like the number one
[24:38] performing stock for the last 5 years.
[24:40] You guys like interested in that one at
[24:43] all? Like and I'm just sitting I'm like
[24:45] we're so early, dude. Like we're so
[24:48] early. But yeah, it's like everybody's
[24:51] obsessed with this, you know? And like
[24:53] they have to be. And I I don't think
[24:55] that they they realize it's
[24:58] because their money is not getting more
[25:02] valuable and their money is losing
[25:05] value over time. Most people still most
[25:10] people who
[25:13] understand
[25:15] inflation enough to understand
[25:18] that prices are going up forever.
[25:24] in fiat terms don't understand that the
[25:27] value of their dollars the purchasing
[25:30] power of
[25:32] the their dollars is going down forever.
[25:35] they don't make that correlation and I
[25:38] you know and so instead of trying to
[25:42] like explain
[25:44] that I just I just sit there and go yeah
[25:48] get [ __ ] Apple's good Apple's good
[25:52] Alphabet that's a good one
[25:56] too I I would love to see that uh you're
[26:00] sitting in the in the in the corner yeah
[26:01] of course get it get it I only have
[26:04] Bitcoin
[26:06] Yeah, I mean I'm like I don't even think
[26:09] about stocks or anything. I don't think
[26:13] about that stuff at all anymore. I just,
[26:14] you know, I buy Bitcoin on a a regular
[26:17] basis and told storage it and and that's
[26:20] and then I live my life.
[26:22] How did you come to that piece? I I
[26:25] think a lot of Bitcoiners still to this
[26:27] day don't came to that piece. Uh, I
[26:30] think uh probably the majority of the
[26:33] Bitcoiners because it's not like the the
[26:35] podcast and Twitter bubble that we live
[26:37] in, um, the majority of Bitcoiners are
[26:41] the ones that have like $2,000 on on on
[26:44] Coinbase somewhere stored and they also
[26:46] have some some stocks and they have some
[26:48] meme coins and like like that's the
[26:50] actual majority of Bitcoiners in in pure
[26:53] numbers, not in how how much Bitcoin
[26:55] they have, but in in pure numbers when
[26:57] we uh have a head found. So, how did you
[27:00] come to that peaceful state that it's
[27:04] Bitcoin and Bitcoin only? Oh, yeah.
[27:06] Well, I would say gradually then
[27:10] suddenly uh for sure. Um, you know, I I
[27:14] was a shitcoiner. Um, in like
[27:20] 2018, 19, 20, in uh
[27:24] 20 I 20 I closed out all of my
[27:30] uh
[27:34] traditional investment accounts. Like I
[27:37] called up uh I called up my Charles Awab
[27:42] guy and I was like, "Close the account.
[27:44] I'm going all in on this crypto
[27:47] [ __ ] But the guy was the the guy even
[27:51] said he was like, "Are you sure?" I was
[27:53] like, "Yes, sir. I'm I'm sure." At that
[27:56] time, I would say I was probably
[27:59] like I would have told people that I was
[28:01] like 50% Bitcoin and then, you
[28:05] know,
[28:06] 30%, you know, top 10 coins and then
[28:10] 20%, you know, [ __ ] coins. not not
[28:14] understanding that like everything was a
[28:17] shitcoin cuz I thought like oh like
[28:19] Ethereum and XRP and Tardano like the
[28:23] these are solid projects you know like
[28:26] these are the long-term holds you know
[28:29] all you got to do is just keep holding
[28:30] these things
[28:32] um you know and I I you know eventually
[28:35] like I found a project way down the list
[28:41] way down the list that I thought was,
[28:43] you know, they're going to go to the the
[28:46] moon, you know, and uh, you know, like I
[28:50] got the the damned pretty hard. Um, you
[28:54] know, I like eventually moved like all
[28:58] my funds into that with that that one
[29:03] uh a token. And
[29:06] um so I like I sold my Bitcoin in
[29:11] 20 21 actually at at the top of the
[29:14] market actually sold for 68K and like I
[29:17] thought I was a genius but then I just I
[29:21] moved it into a shitcoin and so that
[29:25] was the the last time that I I sold my
[29:29] Bitcoin actually. And uh so I got like
[29:32] you know I just got scammed you know and
[29:34] I I lost like
[29:37] uh of my life savings essentially. I put
[29:41] into this this one Shitcoin project and
[29:44] uh you know it was a a very it was a
[29:46] very elegant a rug pole uh that went on
[29:50] for like uh two years. It was like two
[29:54] years of gaslighting saying it's coming,
[29:56] you know, we're going to launch soon,
[29:58] blah blah blah. You know, we've got this
[30:00] new investor coming in. We got a few
[30:04] million dollars that just got injected.
[30:06] We're going to do this, you know, we're
[30:07] going to do that. There was like a
[30:09] website, a podcast. Like these guys went
[30:12] to great lengths to, you know, solidify
[30:17] the scam that they they pulled on
[30:20] everybody, you know, and like and like
[30:21] they had scammed everybody within the
[30:23] the first couple weeks and like so for
[30:26] like two and a half years it was just
[30:28] like nonsense gaslighting whatever. So
[30:32] you know sometime in that process in
[30:36] that 2 and 1/2 years I learned enough
[30:41] about Bitcoin to understand that like oh
[30:46] the this one's not like the other ones
[30:49] that that you know
[30:51] the the differentiation here like
[30:54] largely is the
[30:57] uh counterparty risk and that there's no
[31:00] counterparty risk with Bitcoin. And so I
[31:03] learned that firsthand is that like I
[31:05] don't want to deal with a founder. I
[31:07] don't want to deal with a community that
[31:10] like I have to be a part of and I have
[31:12] to do all this [ __ ] for and I have to
[31:15] promote their thing. Like I don't want
[31:16] to do any of that stuff. And so I
[31:19] learned firsthand that like Bitcoin's uh
[31:23] lack of counterparty risk is like the
[31:25] the
[31:27] real attractiveness uh for me. And then
[31:30] I just learned about the
[31:34] properties of money. And then I got into
[31:37] Austrian economics. And then I got into
[31:39] game theory. And then I I learned about
[31:43] how fiat is like so is the most evil
[31:47] corrupt system of all time. And then I
[31:50] learned about central banks. I learned
[31:52] about Jackal Island. I learned, you
[31:55] know, and then I learned, you know, I
[31:57] just I'm I'm still going down the rabbit
[32:00] hole on everything and everything I do
[32:04] solidifies my conviction more and more.
[32:09] Um, and then, you know, I got into my
[32:13] like evangelist phase where
[32:17] like after that, like I just wanted to
[32:19] tell everybody I'm like, "Listen, guys,
[32:21] like our money's [ __ ] like we got to
[32:23] get out of this thing and like you know
[32:25] trying to convince everybody that like
[32:27] you know it's like us against the
[32:30] central bankers, the banks, the
[32:34] governments, you know, like everybody's
[32:36] in on this and like we actually have an
[32:38] opportunity right now to to to take back
[32:41] control of the world. um you
[32:46] know put the control back into the hands
[32:49] of the individual
[32:52] um you know and that's what
[32:54] decentralization is is a this is a
[32:57] decentralized movement um to to pull
[33:00] power away from centralized authorities
[33:03] and into the hands of the individual
[33:06] that is is what Bitcoin is the what the
[33:11] movement is you know and then there's,
[33:14] you know, there's a financial aspect to
[33:16] it as well that, you know, is also
[33:19] attracted to people. But so like I got
[33:23] into my evangelist phase and I wanted to
[33:27] tell everybody that and I think after
[33:30] like you know a year of that or so just
[33:37] getting beat down
[33:40] essentially by like me like
[33:44] explaining all of this stuff to
[33:46] everybody and then people going like,
[33:47] "Oh, cool. Did you touch the game the
[33:52] other day?" You know, I'm like, "Oh,
[33:54] man. You guys are fucked." Um, I
[33:57] think after that, I was just like, "All
[33:59] right, like I'm just going to like hold
[34:02] this in here more and like in
[34:07] internalize this more." And then I would
[34:10] say that like
[34:12] I reached a a stacking goal that I
[34:16] honestly like when I I lost everything
[34:19] in
[34:21] 2022, you know? I I was I was in a [ __ ]
[34:24] place, dude. Like I I was in debt. I was
[34:27] in like $90,000 worth
[34:30] of debt and um I had no money left and
[34:35] you know it it was a rough time uh for
[34:37] me and like I went oh man like I would
[34:42] have done it's like I did not do the
[34:47] responsible thing. I did not like pay
[34:50] down my debt and you know I focus on
[34:54] that first. like I I stayed at the
[34:58] margins
[34:59] for a year in order to establish a
[35:05] position in Bitcoin that like made me
[35:08] feel like I was like a part of this
[35:10] thing, you know, cuz I I just I was I
[35:13] was afraid this thing was going
[35:15] to I didn't want to get left behind, you
[35:18] know, and uh like I understood this as
[35:22] like a once
[35:24] a lifetime event. And um so I was like
[35:30] irresponsibly stacking and you know
[35:34] servicing my debt um just enough, you
[35:39] know, and like I didn't have a life
[35:42] outside of that, you know, like I I
[35:45] couldn't really afford to do anything
[35:48] else for a long time. And then, you
[35:51] know, I, you know, I started getting
[35:53] some some some headway there and then
[35:56] and then I, you know, I I reached a
[35:58] stacking goal and I paid down my debt
[36:01] enough and then, you know, we got back
[36:03] on track and then
[36:06] uh my job improved too. We got we got
[36:10] some uh we got a raise there last year.
[36:13] We actually negotiated like the best uh
[36:19] organized labor contract of all time
[36:21] recently. So, we're all we're all very
[36:25] happy with it. And
[36:26] um I hit a stacking goal that I'm like I
[36:30] have enough, you know, um to feel like
[36:34] that like like even if I never added
[36:37] another one, like I would feel like, you
[36:40] know, my retirement in 30 years or
[36:44] whatever is going to be okay. It's like
[36:46] I like like I consider that like as like
[36:51] like
[36:53] enough for me is like enough to
[36:58] avoid being old and poor. That's what
[37:03] enough
[37:04] is for me. Like I'm not not looking to
[37:07] buy a Lambo.
[37:10] Um, and so it's like the the like the
[37:12] combination of all of that and then just
[37:17] deciding on one day that like I don't
[37:19] want to keep checking the price every
[37:23] day like this. I don't want to keep
[37:25] staring at my screen. I don't want to,
[37:27] you know, I just I just don't it's like
[37:29] it's enough. And also like I just think
[37:32] like short-term price predictions are
[37:36] like the lowest form of vision.
[37:39] to be honest with you. I'm just like, I
[37:40] don't care. I got a friend of mine who
[37:42] asks me all the time. He's like, "Ed,
[37:45] when do we go into, you know, a 500k?"
[37:48] I'm like, "I don't care." Like, I don't
[37:50] care. It's not going to change my life
[37:52] anyway. It's not going to lead to like
[37:55] any sort of action anyway. And so I
[37:59] think just like realizing all of that
[38:00] like even if this thing goes to a
[38:03] million dollars tomorrow, I'm still
[38:05] going to get up and go to work. I'm
[38:08] still going to do all the things that I
[38:11] I could do now. And so I don't care. And
[38:16] I I think that like the the the process
[38:19] of all of that has just led me to be
[38:22] like here now, which is where I'm like,
[38:24] I don't care about the price. I don't
[38:26] care about anything anymore. Like, I've
[38:28] come so far. And so, it's like like the
[38:32] zen that it may seem like I have now.
[38:34] Like, I [ __ ] earned it, dude. Like,
[38:36] that's how like I earned it. Let's take
[38:38] a break for a moment and appreciate the
[38:41] beauty that Coin Vigilante has made with
[38:44] the Bitcoin watches. Those watches are
[38:47] the most amazing, the most elegant way
[38:50] of showing that you are a true
[38:52] Bitcoiner. and Coin Vigilante just
[38:55] dropped a completely new and amazing
[38:57] Genesis edition of their watch
[39:00] collections. You have the date of the
[39:02] first ever minded Bitcoin block in there
[39:06] and of course also the block height and
[39:08] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[39:12] the level of detail they put in in this
[39:14] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[39:17] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[39:20] down in the descriptions. I love those
[39:22] watches. so so much. And now if you have
[39:25] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[39:28] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[39:30] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[39:32] to deal with that. The first way is you
[39:34] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[39:37] entry for you to get into the
[39:39] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[39:42] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[39:45] super simple and secure way. And if you
[39:48] check out the link in the description,
[39:50] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[39:53] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[39:56] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[39:59] partner in terms of how to get the most
[40:02] out of your sovereignty. They will
[40:04] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[40:08] that is perfect for your individual
[40:11] situation. They will show you how you
[40:13] can secure your own devices. Securing
[40:16] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[40:17] have to keep all your devices secure.
[40:20] One topic that is overlooked often is
[40:22] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[40:25] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[40:28] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[40:30] place already? And last but not least,
[40:32] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[40:34] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[40:37] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[40:42] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30 minute
[40:45] free call. And just a quick side note, I
[40:48] will be for the first time ever speaking
[40:50] at the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[40:53] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[40:56] really looking forward to seeing all of
[40:58] you there. You can get your ticket in
[41:00] the link down in the description of
[41:02] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[41:04] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[41:08] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[41:10] there. A lot of people also feel like
[41:13] they never have enough Bitcoin. I think
[41:15] that's like one small nugget you gave in
[41:17] in there of like, hey, I reached a goal
[41:20] that I'm happy with
[41:23] and I don't have to do something above
[41:26] that. Like I'm I have enough. I keep
[41:28] stacking, but I feel satisfied with my
[41:32] my Bitcoin stack. A lot
[41:34] of I don't know. Like I'm I'm not yet uh
[41:39] um I'm not yet there. Like that's one
[41:41] thing where I'm like, "Okay, I'll I'm
[41:43] not satisfied at all. Maybe that's just
[41:46] my me saying like uh um maybe it's also
[41:50] the age. I don't know. Maybe with with
[41:52] 26 you you think differently. I don't
[41:54] know if um I how you look at that but I
[41:59] have not come to this to the s I've come
[42:03] to the s that um I know it's bitcoin
[42:06] only but I've not come to the s that I
[42:09] have enough as like oh like I I I really
[42:12] want to do way more I mean there's like
[42:14] 80 years in front of me so I I'm not uh
[42:17] rushing I I don't look out for for
[42:20] short-term gains uh but when I Just look
[42:24] at the stack right now. I'm like, nah,
[42:26] not enough. I If you could sell
[42:30] I each coin for $100 million, could you
[42:34] have enough?
[42:36] Yeah, probably.
[42:38] Then you have enough. It's just that
[42:40] simple. like you like
[42:44] you you
[42:46] only don't feel that you have enough
[42:48] right now because you're a valuing it in
[42:52] in the current uh fiat offering. And so
[42:57] that's what it feels like. also like
[42:59] enough is is subjective like enough for
[43:03] what you know and so
[43:07] like enough will change all the time
[43:09] like right now too like you might just
[43:12] want to have enough to to you know be
[43:15] able to live and fund your current
[43:18] lifestyle for uh 40 more or 60 [ __ ]
[43:22] you're you're so young like you don't
[43:25] have enough right you're
[43:26] right have enough yet. But um no, like
[43:30] if you wanted to, you know, it's
[43:33] like as I get older, I realize like I
[43:39] want more of money so I could take care
[43:43] of more people. like the that's where
[43:47] like anytime that I feel like I don't
[43:51] have enough yet,
[43:53] it's because like I want to help more
[43:56] people with it. And and I understand
[44:00] that any money that I save now can
[44:04] potentially help, you know, 10x 100x
[44:08] more
[44:09] in the future. you know, I I I know it's
[44:13] going to sound like I'm like, you know,
[44:14] like I'm super humble and like I don't
[44:17] uh think about myself or, you know,
[44:20] anything like that. Like I just want to
[44:21] help other people, but I don't I think I
[44:24] just learned about uh value and like I
[44:27] don't value like I like of course like I
[44:29] would love to have like a [ __ ] you
[44:31] know like a sweet luxury a vehicle and
[44:36] all that stuff but like at the same time
[44:38] like I [ __ ] man I don't I
[44:42] don't I value that stuff anymore because
[44:45] I
[44:46] like I view all of that as like
[44:48] untainted by uh fiat like I think all of
[44:53] that like luxury and a marketing and all
[44:57] of that. Like all of that is like a fiat
[45:00] extension and I just like I'm like I
[45:02] don't want to be a part of that, you
[45:04] know? I just uh it just makes me sick.
[45:07] And I think of what the the world would
[45:11] look like if we if none of us valued
[45:16] like status as much as as we all do now.
[45:20] Like everybody does, right? But it's
[45:22] like if we change the the perception of
[45:26] what status meant and and it's stopped
[45:30] meaning like oh that guy's
[45:32] rich and it's started meaning oh that
[45:35] guy's really smart or that guy's really
[45:38] helpful or you know that guy's a
[45:42] they're
[45:44] conversationalist a good friend he's a
[45:47] good mentor like if if we if we changed
[45:51] And
[45:53] I think we all
[45:55] still value that stuff. It's just that
[45:58] like the fiat system is
[46:01] constantly, you know, trying to convince
[46:05] you that unless you
[46:07] have an M5, you suck. And I think that
[46:12] that's just like the worst message,
[46:15] especially for like younger men, you
[46:18] know, because like we just need to get
[46:19] back to just having
[46:22] strong men in the world. And I and I
[46:24] think that like all of the the fiat
[46:26] nonsense
[46:29] just it just makes men into like
[46:33] cowards. That made me thinking of the
[46:36] last call I did with you and um with
[46:39] with the YouTube members. I think it was
[46:42] Michael who said it and and it it
[46:45] actually since then it stuck with me in
[46:47] my brain. He that's just one sentence
[46:49] that he said and I can't remember
[46:51] exactly but I remember uh the essence of
[46:54] it. He's like, "Oh, I I could afford
[46:57] uh a nice
[46:58] car, but I know this car, this money of
[47:02] this nice car could also help somewhere
[47:05] to build a school." Something along
[47:07] those lines, he he said. and he knows
[47:09] like if if I give that whatever amount
[47:13] of dollars it is to to a nice car,
[47:16] that's amount of dollars that I cannot
[47:18] give to something I truly care about.
[47:21] And so it it's it's it's like this
[47:25] discussion of what do you actually
[47:27] value? Do you value being there for for
[47:30] your people and caring for for your
[47:32] family, for your loved ones, for your
[47:34] neighbors, and maybe even like building
[47:37] schools somewhere and stuff like that?
[47:38] Like if going going beyond and beyond uh
[47:41] way beyond of that or do you care about
[47:44] your status and you want to Lambo so
[47:47] other people are jealous of you? Like
[47:50] what what do you want of that? Yeah. You
[47:53] know, and like I like like I know now
[47:55] like my mom is
[47:57] 65. Um, and like, oh man, like all I
[48:02] want like I like I will drive a a Toyota
[48:05] for the rest of my life if it means that
[48:08] like I can buy my mom a house like
[48:12] near the beach and just make sure that
[48:16] she's taken care of for the rest of her
[48:20] life. That's all I want. And so like the
[48:24] idea of me, you know, and like I
[48:27] can I always hate saying this, but like
[48:29] I can afford things like I don't have to
[48:32] live the the life that I live right now,
[48:36] but I do because I like what an [ __ ]
[48:39] I would would be if I was paying
[48:43] $1,400 a month to drive a car when like
[48:48] my mom, you know, needs that money. It's
[48:51] just it's just it's it's um you know I
[48:55] don't you know it's just this
[48:57] is the stuff that you learn when you
[49:01] like really dig into value and you
[49:05] understand what value is and like I
[49:08] never asked myself that like what is a
[49:10] is value
[49:12] like where does value come from? How is
[49:16] this valuable to me? you know, and like
[49:19] these are things that like I ask myself
[49:21] all the time before any purchase
[49:24] nowadays, you know, like how like why is
[49:28] this
[49:29] valuable? And um you know, Bitcoin is is
[49:34] the mechanism that really like enables
[49:36] us
[49:37] to to start asking those questions.
[49:40] That's that's really awesome. How do you
[49:43] define value? like do you have a
[49:44] framework to think about uh what what
[49:47] what value actually is? Well, whenever I
[49:51] I start to think about it, I like it's
[49:54] just like an immediate like
[49:57] subjectiveness, right? Like subjectivity
[50:00] is at the core of understanding value.
[50:03] So we know the the idea
[50:07] of intrinsic value which like whenever I
[50:10] hear somebody say like oh this person
[50:12] doesn't understand value but but they
[50:15] usually mean
[50:16] is utility value that that's usually
[50:19] what they mean and they're
[50:21] just conflating the terms
[50:26] like Peter Schiff does not actually
[50:28] understand that what he's trying to say
[50:30] is utility value but let's
[50:33] Let's not get into that one. But um uh
[50:37] so like understanding that a value is
[50:40] not something that's inherent within
[50:43] things. It's a thing that we place on
[50:47] things. So like so the source of all
[50:50] value is the individual. It's the human
[50:55] or or the collective as well because the
[50:58] collective can also value things as a
[51:01] whole too. But humans place value on
[51:05] things. A value does not
[51:08] exist
[51:10] innately within things. A shiny gold
[51:14] rock does not have
[51:17] value within it innately. We choose to
[51:22] apply that value onto it. And so all
[51:26] value begins in the human mind. So
[51:29] that's like the framework that like I
[51:33] consider it from always I always start
[51:35] value begins in here and it's always
[51:38] contextual and it's always dependent on
[51:42] the situation because a trillion dollars
[51:45] in cash does you no good if you're on a
[51:49] deserted island. I mean you could use it
[51:51] for you know to start a fire but that
[51:54] that's about it. maybe toilet paper, but
[51:57] you know if you're you but yeah uh so
[52:03] contextual
[52:04] subjective amorphice like it it to
[52:08] change at all times. I I don't think a
[52:12] lot of people understand that uh fiat um
[52:16] all fiat is subject to be turned off.
[52:21] the government can decide that any
[52:24] serial number
[52:26] uh dollar bill or you know whatever can
[52:31] all of a sudden by decree have no value
[52:35] anymore. they can just decide
[52:38] that and so you know
[52:42] when you understand that it's like it's
[52:45] like value only exists in our minds and
[52:48] I I think that that's like number one
[52:52] for people to to get across and then
[52:54] there's utility value is this other
[52:57] thing but it's it's still applies to
[53:00] human beings because it's like how can
[53:02] we utilize this for our needs and So
[53:06] that's what utility value is just a a a
[53:11] more
[53:13] defined less abstract form of a value is
[53:17] there and that's so profound. I love
[53:20] that and and it's it's something um
[53:23] something in the Bitcoin community is
[53:25] actually kind of well understood the the
[53:28] subjectivity of of value. But I think
[53:31] it's so important that we hammer that
[53:33] down more and more because whenever I go
[53:36] outside of the Bitcoin community there's
[53:39] this concept of like yeah there there's
[53:40] like value there's price but the value
[53:43] there's some kind of magic intrinsic
[53:45] value which there isn't and I love your
[53:48] desert uh example because I always bring
[53:51] that example up with with people that
[53:53] don't believe me. I'm like, "How much do
[53:56] you value?" If I give you the choice
[53:57] right now and I say, "Hey, I give you a
[54:01] Lambo or a bottle of water, what would
[54:04] you take?" You would probably take the
[54:06] the Lambo because water is pretty easy
[54:08] to to get. But if you're in the
[54:11] desert, most Lambos cannot drive in the
[54:14] desert. So, that that's the only thing.
[54:18] uh between those two choices, you would
[54:20] take the water because it means you can
[54:22] live a little bit longer. You can go a
[54:25] little bit longer because I I believe I
[54:27] I never drove my Lambo in the in the
[54:29] desert, but I I believe they they
[54:30] probably are pretty useless out there.
[54:33] Otherwise, my comparison is bad. But but
[54:35] you get what I mean. You look cool as
[54:37] hell, though. You would look cool as
[54:38] hell out there for sure. Yeah. But it
[54:41] would just like go into the sand.
[54:47] Yeah, you know, it's um Yeah, it's like,
[54:50] you know, and even even in Bitcoin, too,
[54:53] because I I had a hard time first
[54:55] because I was orange pill from Michael
[54:59] Sailor just listening to his podcast and
[55:03] uh specifically his agreed
[55:07] love is money episodes one through
[55:10] through nine, which if anybody hasn't
[55:12] seen like you should watch that, you you
[55:14] know um like that will help you a lot
[55:17] here. Um uh you know and his like
[55:21] analogy between energy you know and
[55:24] basically storing your a physical energy
[55:29] into a money form like that's what that
[55:33] we do. Then we
[55:35] trade labor for a money. we're we're
[55:39] we're storing our physical energy that
[55:43] we exert and it's going into the money
[55:47] that we then save as like stored
[55:50] productivity um or excess productivity.
[55:54] Um, but then like I thought that like
[55:58] objectively that my energy was actually
[56:01] in the Bitcoin. Like I I thought that
[56:04] for a few months and until I I you know
[56:08] dug into more um of the uh uh
[56:12] libertarians and I I you know understood
[56:15] this
[56:17] subjectivity of of value and then I was
[56:20] like this Bitcoin is not really worth
[56:23] anything and I went into that sort of
[56:26] thing like it it only is because we all
[56:30] agree on it, you know, because we all
[56:33] because of the value that we place on
[56:36] things. So like my
[56:39] Bitcoin is valued by me. Somebody else
[56:43] could also like value it, but that
[56:45] doesn't mean that I have to sell it for
[56:47] that price. Like I value my Bitcoin at a
[56:51] minimum of $100 million right now. You
[56:55] know, if the if everybody else had
[56:58] valued their Bitcoin at uh $50 million,
[57:02] I would no longer value mine at $100
[57:04] million. So, like I would increase it
[57:07] from there. It's not a for sale, but
[57:10] it's just an example of saying it like
[57:13] this,
[57:14] right? We value things. We place our
[57:17] value on things. Value is not inherently
[57:21] in things. And like I'll say that over
[57:23] and over and over
[57:27] because people will still attach
[57:30] themselves to this idea of intrinsic
[57:33] value. And this this leads me to an
[57:35] interesting one because we can't just
[57:39] take the open source code of Bitcoin and
[57:41] copy it. That's what basically shitcoins
[57:43] are all about. And this brings us to the
[57:47] idea of like okay what is actually the
[57:48] revolution behind Bitcoin? And this is
[57:52] the idea. I think Jeff Bof usually talks
[57:55] about that the most. The idea of we are
[57:57] Bitcoin. It's it's the social layer.
[58:00] It's the revolution. It's the story.
[58:02] It's the origin. It's it's the network
[58:04] effect. It's it's all those things
[58:06] combined that makes Bitcoin valuable.
[58:08] Not any single piece of it. It's the
[58:11] code. It's the social layer. It's the
[58:13] origin story. It's the network effect.
[58:15] It's it's the history. It's like
[58:17] everything combined is the value of
[58:21] Bitcoin and it's only valued because we
[58:23] all are valuing. It's it's the it's the
[58:26] Yeah. I cannot say it better than we are
[58:28] Bitcoin. It's the social layer. Yeah.
[58:31] The the the thing that that we value is
[58:34] is all of it comprehensively. It's not
[58:37] like we're we just value the network or
[58:41] we just value the origin story or we
[58:43] just value the utility of it. We value
[58:47] like the perfect storm of all of it
[58:50] coming together. And when you consider
[58:53] it like that, the idea of saying it's
[58:56] only worth a million dollars each is
[58:58] ridiculous. It's a ridiculous notion to
[59:02] to even attach a fiat a price to it to
[59:07] try to say that there is an a a
[59:12] equivalent number of pieces of paper
[59:17] that could equate to the value of this
[59:21] perfect network, this perfect monetary
[59:24] system. The idea that like that fiat
[59:28] could even come close to that is absurd.
[59:30] Which is why I say like
[59:32] mine's not up for sale in fiat terms.
[59:37] It's just not. And you know and like I
[59:40] would I always say like you know to
[59:42] Bitcoiners who are like obsessed with
[59:43] that like have some respect like have
[59:45] some respect for the thing that that
[59:48] you're holding. This thing is
[59:50] immaculate. We're never going to get
[59:53] another one like this. uh you should
[59:56] place the value on it accordingly when
[60:00] and and taking into account the entire
[60:03] picture of it and understanding that it
[60:05] will never be replicated again. I love
[60:08] that. I it's it's it really is. Is there
[60:12] for you or I I guess there is. What is
[60:16] for you the nonfinancial value of of
[60:19] Bitcoin that Bitcoin brought to your
[60:21] life? Bro, the the not the that that
[60:23] brought to to my life. Well, just the
[60:28] the understanding
[60:30] value, understanding understanding the
[60:34] the people, understanding like
[60:37] incentives, understanding that
[60:39] incentives drive everything and that if
[60:42] if you're not incentivized to do
[60:44] something that you can't do it. and that
[60:46] you could essentially predict human uh
[60:51] behavior if you understand what their
[60:54] incentives are. If you just understand
[60:56] what the the system that everybody's
[60:59] operating in incentivizes and and what
[61:02] it disincentivizes, you can pretty much
[61:05] predict human behavior. You can pretty
[61:07] much see like what's going to happen
[61:09] next. I think that's that's pretty
[61:11] valuable thing. But the the one thing I
[61:13] I did did want to touch upon was like
[61:16] the the value of Bitcoin outside of the
[61:19] financial aspect.
[61:21] Can I get into that real quick?
[61:24] Absolutely. So, I just I just want to
[61:26] say because like this is like a thing
[61:29] that I've only started really thinking
[61:32] about more and now that I'm
[61:36] not paying attention to the price
[61:39] anymore. It's like people don't
[61:41] understand how secure the network is and
[61:44] people don't understand how large and
[61:46] powerful this network is. And I I think
[61:49] it's like man do you understand what a a
[61:53] terraash is? Like I a terraash is a a
[61:59] per second every second a trillion
[62:04] computations. That's one terraash. An
[62:08] exahash is a million of those. We're
[62:12] already at a number that human beings
[62:15] can't like I could say that, "Oh, wow.
[62:17] Yeah, that sounds like a lot." Like, we
[62:20] can't even [ __ ] fathom how high that
[62:24] number is. It's a million
[62:27] trillions. And then the Bitcoin network
[62:30] has eight of those. We're approaching
[62:33] eight of those. 8 million trillions.
[62:37] It's a number that's like farcical. Like
[62:39] I'm certainly not not
[62:42] intelligent enough to visualize this in
[62:46] my head. I just know it's so far out of
[62:48] reach. And that's
[62:50] every second. Every second 8 million
[62:54] trillion computations take place on the
[62:58] network. And every single one of those a
[63:01] actions goes
[63:03] towards securing the
[63:06] network. This would be like like a like
[63:11] when people talk about there's
[63:13] no town of party risk, right? It's
[63:20] like then you drive to work every day
[63:23] and you go over a bridge, right? you
[63:27] risk that bridge collapsing on you. It's
[63:30] a very very low chance though, right?
[63:32] Because you understand that there were
[63:34] engineers that built this thing and the
[63:37] city approved it and there was all this
[63:40] financing that went behind this bridge,
[63:42] but that was just one time. Yeah, they
[63:44] they do some maintenance on a bridge
[63:46] every now and then, but it's not it's
[63:48] just the one time really. And you and
[63:51] you and you trust that, right? Like you
[63:54] trust that every day with
[63:57] their life. Imagine
[64:00] if that
[64:02] bridge had millions
[64:05] of engineers and builders and laborers
[64:09] and people working on that bridge every
[64:12] day. And every second there were 8
[64:15] million trillion actions taken to
[64:20] reinforce the security of that bridge.
[64:24] Would you ever think about am I safe?
[64:28] You don't think about are you safe now?
[64:30] You just drive over it now
[64:32] and none of that's going on. Imagine if
[64:36] there were 8 million trillion actions
[64:39] taken every second to
[64:42] ensure that bridge was was was safe and
[64:46] secure. You would drive over it would be
[64:48] the most safe and secure bridge ever.
[64:50] And that's what we we have here. That's
[64:53] why we say no counterparty risk. There's
[64:57] no counterparty risk at all be because
[65:00] of the fact that there's so much energy
[65:03] and financial energy and physical energy
[65:06] that's going into securing this network
[65:10] all day every day constantly. And it's
[65:12] only going higher, too. There's only
[65:14] more and more of an effort throwing in
[65:18] to secure this thing. When you when I
[65:21] think about that, I'm like, like, of
[65:22] course I would want to own a piece of
[65:25] that bridge. Why wouldn't you? That's
[65:29] the most That's the one. I love that
[65:31] one. I love that one, man. I never heard
[65:33] that. That That was so good. I I think
[65:37] we have to clip that one for for the
[65:39] clips channel as you sent me the the
[65:41] Jeff uh Jeff one, the Jeff Ross one. I
[65:44] would be honored. I would be honored.
[65:46] Wow. Yeah, I just I came up with that
[65:48] this morning, actually. I swear to God I
[65:50] got up this morning. I was like, "Oh, I
[65:51] should say that to him this morning."
[65:54] That that that's that's freaking
[65:55] brilliant because I think people cannot
[65:58] comprehend big numbers in their brains.
[66:01] So good. So we have to come up with
[66:04] comparisons to make it easier for the
[66:06] brain to
[66:07] understand because like there's a VAT,
[66:10] there's a terra like we we don't know
[66:13] what those numbers and and words even
[66:16] mean. They they are so big. If you look
[66:18] at the the hash rate over time of of
[66:22] Bitcoin, it just goes up straight in a
[66:24] line basically. It's it's it's way
[66:27] crazier even than than the Bitcoin
[66:29] price. And then you're like, okay, but
[66:31] what does that actually mean? And your
[66:33] bridge example is is um yeah, like the
[66:36] best explanation honestly that I ever
[66:38] heard on on that. Well, thank you. Thank
[66:40] you very much. Yeah, this is what
[66:41] happens when you don't obsess over the
[66:45] price all day.
[66:46] Z like I actually have an opportunity to
[66:49] to like examine the network to examine
[66:53] what actually Bitcoin is. And what
[66:56] Bitcoin is is this monetary system that
[66:59] produces
[67:00] new units of itself um at a a descending
[67:05] rate of inflation over time that halves
[67:09] every four years. But but the the new
[67:12] new units
[67:14] are produced every 10 minutes loyally
[67:20] faithfully. Um and that's it. Like
[67:23] that's it. Like it's just
[67:25] it's just this thing that makes more of
[67:29] itself with human interaction involved.
[67:32] I always think about Bitcoin as like a a
[67:36] waterfall. Um, I know that's like that's
[67:39] like a
[67:41] sailor's analogy, but I think about it
[67:44] as like it's just this thing that exists
[67:47] in nature. It's just like the digital
[67:50] nature, like the natural
[67:52] digital landscape, it's there. And like
[67:57] anybody who wants to participate in,
[68:00] anybody who wants to like jump in the
[68:02] water, spin under the waterfall, you
[68:05] know, play in it, like it's just there,
[68:09] you know, and you have access to it. And
[68:11] if you're I'm willing to provide energy
[68:15] and resources and capital, like you
[68:18] could you could capture some of it. Like
[68:22] that's it. But it's this thing that's
[68:24] always that's just
[68:25] in nature. It's a commodity like that. I
[68:28] just have one question um before we come
[68:31] to our our end routines, but is there
[68:34] any plans uh when you will start your
[68:36] own podcast? Oh, Robin on the spot. I
[68:40] don't know. I don't know. You know what?
[68:42] Um I do do want to start like
[68:46] a YouTube channel. Um um and just I
[68:51] don't know. Yeah. Yes, I have plans.
[68:55] Yes.
[68:56] I'm I'm really looking forward to to to
[68:59] that to that day. Um we we will
[69:02] definitely um uh we the soon as you
[69:06] start we will do a third round on the
[69:09] podcast. People people uh people love
[69:12] you. Um we have an end routine uh of two
[69:16] questions. Uh, and I kind of altered a
[69:19] little bit my first question for people
[69:20] that uh, have been on the podcast
[69:23] already. So, my first question is, what
[69:27] did you learn since you have last been
[69:30] on besides Bitcoin?
[69:34] Oh, no. No. Uh, it's like the first
[69:38] thing that popped into mind is probably
[69:40] something that would that would wreck
[69:43] your algorithm. Um I'm still looking
[69:45] into that too. Um I would say that like
[69:49] oh okay okay okay is that everything
[69:52] that we do in the traditional financial
[69:57] world we have to ask for permission for
[70:00] first. There is no action that you take
[70:04] that is a sus a
[70:07] sovereign action.
[70:10] Everything you do
[70:12] financially, you ask
[70:14] for permission first from either the
[70:18] bank or the government or your
[70:20] investment firm or whoever it is. You
[70:23] can't do anything on your own. That's a
[70:26] that's a profound thing to to
[70:28] to stumble upon because I'm not a fan of
[70:32] asking permission.
[70:33] Me either, Robin. Me either.
[70:37] Really cool. We have an endine as you
[70:38] know from uh in the podcast where the
[70:40] previous guest is asking a question for
[70:41] the next guest without knowing who the
[70:43] next guest actually is. And the previous
[70:45] guest asked you the question if Bitcoin
[70:48] would be a teacher what lesson do you
[70:51] think it's trying to teach humanity?
[70:54] Humility. That came quick. The easy one.
[70:57] I learned it from Bitcoin. Easy
[71:01] humility. Human beings are so we think
[71:04] so highly of ourselves as a result of
[71:08] the the fiat
[71:13] inspired
[71:14] status that we claim, right? Like people
[71:18] who make like a you know a if if you
[71:21] know somebody who like used to make a
[71:25] little bit of money and now they make a
[71:28] lot of money, you'll notice like they
[71:30] they like they think so highly of
[71:32] themselves, you know, and like or if if
[71:34] if you've been making a a lot of money
[71:38] for a long time, you think very very
[71:42] highly of yourself. I you know for not
[71:46] for everybody obviously but I think that
[71:49] fiat is this thing that leads us to
[71:54] believe that we're are more valuable
[71:57] than we actually are because fiat is a
[72:00] thing that we believe is more valuable
[72:01] than it actually is. And so
[72:05] Bitcoin is this thing that humbles you
[72:08] and makes you understand what your
[72:11] actual value is. It's like the only
[72:13] value that you really have is the value
[72:17] that you can provide other people. It
[72:21] it's not the value the the way that you
[72:25] value yourself in your own head, right?
[72:29] Because that's that's just like a
[72:32] fiat a mindset.
[72:35] You call it fiat mindset. I call it
[72:37] delusional.
[72:40] I like that one too. Yeah.
[72:43] really cool. Thank you so much, Eddie,
[72:45] for for being on. It was as always a joy
[72:48] and I'm I can't wait for the third round
[72:50] because that means you have a YouTube
[72:52] channel and you have your own podcast.
[72:54] Uh so I'm really looking forward to that
[72:56] one. Thank you so much, Eddie, for being
[72:57] on. Also, thank you so much for everyone
[72:59] that is watching and listening, for
[73:00] joining us today. As always, I'll be
[73:02] back tomorrow with another episode.
[73:04] Bye-bye.
