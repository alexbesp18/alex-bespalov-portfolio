[00:00] with Bitcoin we remove completely all
[00:02] the need for all the legal all the
[00:04] regulatory all the enforcement
[00:06] infrastructure that is super expensive
[00:08] and that is needed in order to to reach
[00:10] consensus on who owns what you realize
[00:13] that what people used to use where our
[00:16] sense stor used as self-coded wealth
[00:18] they used this as an insurance and what
[00:21] Bitcoin enables is just that in case
[00:23] things go crazy that it's very likely
[00:26] nowadays if you think about it internet
[00:28] is changing completely the trust in our
[00:31] [Music]
[00:34] institutions how do you in general
[00:37] foresee Bitcoin scaling and evolving in
[00:40] like the next decade or two decades uh
[00:42] because we have not a lot bit people in
[00:46] Bitcoin now and I hope we have a lot of
[00:48] people in Bitcoin in like 20
[00:50] years yeah um yeah I mean definitely
[00:54] liquid is one option but liquid is just
[00:56] an implementation of of the elements
[00:59] codebase so um even if liquid were not
[01:02] able to scale it all and even if by
[01:07] adding uh lightning Network on top of
[01:09] liquid it were not enough then we have
[01:12] anyone can spin up another Federation
[01:14] for a particular number of use cases for
[01:16] example and and others could Implement
[01:19] their own side chains for Bitcoin right
[01:22] and and depending on the tradeoffs there
[01:26] might be use cases for which a number of
[01:28] H trade trade-offs on the Chain would be
[01:31] preferable to those on liquid I don't
[01:33] know but if that were the case others
[01:36] have the elements code base right there
[01:39] you know available to spin up anything
[01:42] and um you know and uh cater to The
[01:45] Right Use cases so I think I think we'll
[01:49] see that happening I don't h i probably
[01:52] not one of the people that thinks that
[01:56] um everyone is necessarily going to be
[01:59] used
[02:00] Bitcoin for absolutely everything so
[02:03] that also decreases the number of you
[02:06] know the need or the requirements for
[02:08] those chains um but um but yeah I mean
[02:12] definitely there's Tech enough in there
[02:15] to you know to cater to a lot of
[02:17] people um maybe let's go in there like
[02:20] because it's interesting usually people
[02:21] like oh Bitcoin will scale to everyone
[02:23] and stuff like that but like what are
[02:25] the people that will not adopt Bitcoin
[02:27] or like who who will adopt Bitcoin like
[02:29] what's the differentiation here I um The
[02:33] View I have on on bitcoin and um and on
[02:37] liquid uh I mean in fact thanks to
[02:40] studying liquid and the use cases that
[02:42] it can enable I changed my mind with
[02:45] regards to bitcoin you know I used to be
[02:47] a person that as many others used to
[02:50] think that Bitcoin is going to be a hard
[02:53] money and um used by everyone and needed
[02:56] to scale to for everyone but I changed
[02:59] my
[03:00] mind just a couple of years ago probably
[03:04] and and the reason is that I think that
[03:07] what Cipher punks were trying to solve
[03:08] was basically enabling trust to scale
[03:12] right and and that and and I think that
[03:15] probably Satoshi made a lot of work to
[03:17] trying to to to enable a one of those
[03:20] rights the the ability to exchange with
[03:22] money but but without proper stability I
[03:27] I I changed my mind and I now think that
[03:29] it will be hard to to be used as a
[03:32] general means of of exchange so what I
[03:35] think now Bitcoin is is basically a
[03:38] digital private property without the
[03:39] need for loss right so so basically what
[03:42] Cypher punks were trying to enable was
[03:44] um our trust to scale by removing the
[03:48] needed parts that are in the in the
[03:49] middle right to enable our cooperation
[03:52] and and what what are what is needed in
[03:54] our cooperation is um institutions right
[03:57] is is basically and protocols that are
[04:00] in in the middle between you and I for
[04:02] example if we don't know each other if
[04:04] you and I are strangers in order to
[04:07] cooperate and Cypher punks by removing
[04:10] that the need for those institutions
[04:12] enable trust to scale in in the digital
[04:14] age right and and I think that one of
[04:16] those institutions is private property
[04:19] if you if you cannot own things in in
[04:21] the internet er er you know and you
[04:25] can't exchange them perhaps not at scale
[04:28] as if it were money but you can still
[04:30] exchange them then it it is hard for for
[04:33] trust to scale in the digital age if I
[04:35] want to make business with someone in in
[04:37] Argentina or Mexico Albania or wherever
[04:41] and and I'm more I follow more the the
[04:44] sub what I call the Nix Sabo School of
[04:46] Economics rather than the school of
[04:49] Economics of many other bitcoiners out
[04:51] there right and and that that this has
[04:53] changed my whole um let's say Bitcoin
[04:56] worldview and and but that's why in part
[05:00] I think that not that many I mean not
[05:03] everyone will need to adopt a
[05:06] Bitcoin with adopt Bitcoin you mean with
[05:10] uh putting it like as a medium of
[05:13] exchange and not the store of value
[05:15] aspect like adopting Bitcoin is not for
[05:16] you when when someone also just like
[05:18] holds it for a store of value uh reasons
[05:21] because it seems like you it store of
[05:23] value um is really good but you don't
[05:26] think it will be in meded exchange yeah
[05:29] I mean I think it's it's a great store
[05:31] of value but what I think Bitcoin is
[05:34] best for is basically enable enabling
[05:38] private property whenever you cannot own
[05:41] property otherwise and that happens in
[05:44] countries and in situations where a rule
[05:47] of law doesn't work you know where I
[05:49] mean basically if you think about it
[05:51] what makes money good is actually how
[05:55] good is the depbt in the asset side of
[05:58] of the Central Bank balance sheet right
[06:01] that is what makes the the rule of law
[06:04] in the US for example is really good
[06:06] compared to many other countries it's
[06:08] not great it's not the best it's not
[06:11] ideal but better way better than in many
[06:13] other countries as well in and it's in
[06:15] Switzerland and if you have proper rule
[06:17] of law that means that debts are likely
[06:20] to get paid back right and if debts get
[06:23] paid back the the balance sheet the
[06:25] asset side of the balance sheet of a
[06:27] central bank is basically
[06:30] mostly private and public debt and and
[06:33] and if that public and private debt is
[06:35] likely to be paid it means that asset
[06:38] balance sheet is is good is valuable and
[06:41] therefore the the liability part of it
[06:43] which is the currency is is valuable as
[06:46] well and that's why a countries with
[06:49] good rule of law enable good money but
[06:52] also private property you know people
[06:54] can be sure that their private property
[06:57] is is something that they can Count On
[07:00] You Know by you know using the courts or
[07:02] whatever disputes are typically
[07:04] solved and uh and with Bitcoin we remove
[07:08] completely all that you know we remove
[07:10] completely all the need for all the
[07:13] legal ER all the regulator all the
[07:16] enforcement infrastructure that is super
[07:18] expensive and that is needed in order to
[07:21] to reach consensus on who owns what you
[07:24] know reaching consensus on who is what
[07:27] is something that is is so f fascinating
[07:30] and and But but so extremely expensive
[07:32] that even nowadays in in the 21st
[07:35] century most countries cannot afford it
[07:38] and they have wars you know they have
[07:40] gas they have terrorism they have every
[07:42] single you know kind of thing and
[07:46] because the rule of law is not there so
[07:48] in those situations and also in Cy cyber
[07:51] space which is an a place where rule of
[07:54] law doesn't exist and it's impossible to
[07:56] implement where where laws don't work
[07:59] it's also an area where you need a a
[08:03] technology to enable private property
[08:05] without the need for those lws and
[08:06] that's where I think Bitcoin excels
[08:09] basically you know and and and and so so
[08:12] for me even if many people in
[08:14] Switzerland own um Bitcoin in my view
[08:18] probably Switzerland would be the
[08:19] country where people would need it the
[08:21] least right and and so that but that is
[08:24] the
[08:25] fundamental use case in my opinion it
[08:27] doesn't mean that many people will not
[08:30] be jumping on this ship in order to
[08:33] speculate with a potential uh you know
[08:36] increase in value right which is you
[08:39] know which is probably the most common
[08:42] use case at this point I think that
[08:45] eventually more and more people will
[08:46] realize that it is good to own an
[08:48] insurance if you if you look at the
[08:51] article and the at the shelling out
[08:53] article from Nick Sabo which
[08:55] is probably one of the best ones from
[08:58] him you you realize that what people
[09:01] used to use where our sensors used as
[09:04] self-coded wealth they used this as an
[09:07] insurance mostly right and and what
[09:11] Bitcoin enables is just that in case
[09:13] things go crazy which is also a use case
[09:16] that it's very likely nowadays if you
[09:18] think about it internet is changing
[09:21] completely the trust in our institutions
[09:23] in our existing institutions you know
[09:26] everything that we're seeing in the news
[09:27] nowadays is basically a com massive
[09:31] transfer shift a massive shift of trust
[09:34] in the institutions you know in
[09:36] governments in laws in contracts in in
[09:39] banks in in the police in you know
[09:41] whatever institution you can think of
[09:44] trust is basically shifting away from
[09:46] those and moving away to new ones and it
[09:50] was very interesting to see for example
[09:52] Elon mask's tweet recently challenging
[09:56] the EU you know I found it fascinating
[10:00] because it's a a new institution which
[10:02] is Twitter saying hey you cannot get in
[10:05] there in here right you you have to stop
[10:08] you know and I'm going to stop you it's
[10:10] basically a sovereign individual
[10:12] stopping the EU you know from getting
[10:14] into you from from censoring all our
[10:18] tweets so yeah it's a incredible part of
[10:22] incredible changes we're leaving and and
[10:25] I think that those that work in Bitcoin
[10:27] and and Technology say such as liquid
[10:29] are you know on the right side of
[10:31] History
[10:32] basically do you think then uh when
[10:36] Bitcoin will not be used as a mean of
[10:38] exchange uh from everyone we need
[10:40] something else like do you think that
[10:41] feat currencies then will always be
[10:43] around I think I think so but let me
[10:45] clarify something when I say means of
[10:48] exchange I don't mean money money for me
[10:51] is a generally a commonly accepted means
[10:54] of exchange so it means that whatever
[10:56] you're going to be paying it is very to
[10:59] be accepted right and that's what I
[11:02] think Bitcoin is not going to be but I
[11:04] think Bitcoin is a great means of
[11:06] exchange right it's going to be accepted
[11:09] as a means of exchange for I don't know
[11:11] how wide but a decent number of use
[11:13] cases you know so you and I will be able
[11:16] to exchange Bitcoin easily but it
[11:19] doesn't it doesn't mean that I'm going
[11:21] to go to a store down there and it's
[11:23] going to be easily accepted and chances
[11:26] are you know it's going to be accepted
[11:29] for sure you know other means of
[11:32] exchange that keep stability will be you
[11:35] know um more uh demanded by the market I
[11:39] believe right and that's that's why
[11:41] tether rocks you know it's it's
[11:42] basically killing it right and usdt is
[11:45] basically doing something that liquid
[11:48] enables which is connecting a reputed
[11:51] institutions like like the Central Bank
[11:54] in in the US with users worldwide that
[11:57] wouldn't have basically my opinion
[11:59] tether is exporting rule of law the the
[12:02] US rule of law to users worldwide you
[12:05] know and it's it's fascinating you know
[12:07] but so I think that I am very critical
[12:10] of the still very prevalent view with
[12:13] bitcoiners that um well I'm not very
[12:16] critical I'm I'm okay but what I mean is
[12:18] I don't agree with it any longer you
[12:20] know with a view that Bitcoin is going
[12:22] to be used to be used absolutely
[12:24] everywhere I think it's going to be used
[12:26] a lot for a for a while set of use cases
[12:32] but that is different than being a
[12:34] generally accepted or a common accepted
[12:37] means of exchange that that that is an
[12:39] entirely different uh story because the
[12:41] the lack of stability is not something
[12:43] that some anyone has figured out even
[12:46] you know if you think about it even Nick
[12:49] Sabo gave up with bit gold right he was
[12:51] trying to enable that kind of stability
[12:54] in the supply and and he gave up right
[12:58] so um yeah that's that's my view if that
[13:01] makes sense what do you mean with uh
[13:04] stability in in Supply do you mean price
[13:07] volatility or yeah what I mean is in
[13:10] order to be stable it needs to be stable
[13:13] with regards compared to um a basket of
[13:16] goods right the price of a basket of
[13:19] goods whatever size it is but a basket
[13:21] of goods and and if Supply is basically
[13:25] fixed then and and demand is variable by
[13:29] def fault the demand for money on
[13:30] liquidity is is very variable so the the
[13:34] chances that demand is going to match H
[13:37] Supply at you know continuous or very
[13:40] constant time is very unlikely in my
[13:43] opinion I don't I don't totally discard
[13:46] it to be honest I don't totally discard
[13:47] it there might be folks out there you
[13:50] know way mared than me that figure out
[13:52] ways in which you can enable some kind
[13:56] of Supply mechanism that adapts to
[13:58] demand you know which is what a
[13:59] centralized entity like a central bank
[14:01] does in when there are many things they
[14:04] do but one of them is this one and it's
[14:06] it's valuable but but I'm at this point
[14:10] way less I buy this idea less than I did
[14:13] a couple of years ago or and more I mean
[14:15] the volatility is interesting because
[14:16] for me it's like um right now it's
[14:19] highly volatile of course it's like a
[14:21] really young uh form of money like if if
[14:24] you look at the history of money like
[14:25] the those things needed like hundred
[14:28] some like thousands of years to actually
[14:30] develop uh and so like Bitcoin is like
[14:33] so young and and and like how many
[14:36] people actually have 50% plus of their
[14:39] net worth in Bitcoin like like that
[14:42] number has to be super low like a lot of
[14:44] people like I guess like 100 million
[14:46] maybe 200 million people have in some
[14:48] capacity Bitcoin but if you have just
[14:50] like 2% of your net worth in Bitcoin how
[14:52] much do you really have in in Bitcoin so
[14:56] so no let me let me clarify that this is
[14:59] is partly this change in opinion is
[15:00] partly based in my experience you know I
[15:02] have kids I have lots of expenses and I
[15:06] realize the cost of volatility is huge
[15:09] you you know I I used to before having
[15:12] kids and all these expenses I used to
[15:14] think it's okay to have to be 50 60% of
[15:17] my net worth in in Bitcoin wow it I
[15:22] totally changed my mind right because
[15:24] you
[15:25] know if you need if your demand for
[15:28] liquidity Happ when the price is in here
[15:30] it's going to hurt and and I've been
[15:33] really through a lot of pain right and
[15:35] so that that personal experience is
[15:37] mostly what made me change my mind a lot
[15:41] with this
[15:41] regard yeah I mean know like right now
[15:44] it's it's highly volatile like you you
[15:46] cannot really like it's hard right now
[15:49] to use it as 100% Bitcoin standard like
[15:51] if you do that uh you kind of you live
[15:54] in uh in El Salvador and you're doing
[15:56] that that's that that means that you
[15:59] have a stable income that you can rely
[16:01] on and that you can actually pay your
[16:04] bills even if it fluctuates like
[16:06] 50% um so as I do it like I have
[16:09] everything that I don't need for my
[16:11] monthly income in Bitcoin uh and I rely
[16:14] on that that income comes every month
[16:17] and I also said a lot of the times if I
[16:21] have would have kids if I would have
[16:23] employees if I had with like other
[16:25] responsibilities that would totally
[16:27] change like if I uh like right now I
[16:30] have the situation where uh if all the
[16:33] Bitcoin goes to zero tomorrow and at the
[16:36] same time all my income goes to zero
[16:38] tomorrow I still can live a few months
[16:41] yes I cannot live like uh with five
[16:45] people three months that's not possible
[16:47] because I'm so risky in there like I'm
[16:49] just 25 I can also still live with my
[16:52] parents and stuff like that like I have
[16:53] a personal situation this is always
[16:55] important but the point that I was
[16:57] before getting to is like what happens
[16:59] if like more crazy people like me um put
[17:04] like over 50% of their net worth in
[17:07] Bitcoin because then I guess it gets way
[17:11] more stable and I'm talking like really
[17:13] long term like I'm not talking like 10
[17:15] 20 years I think it needs way longer I
[17:17] think volatility is going to be a lot
[17:20] more crazy in the next years than even
[17:22] it was like the last years because like
[17:24] a lot of uh forces come into play but uh
[17:28] what if the volatility against Market
[17:30] Goods is stable because so many people
[17:33] actually adopted this as a store of
[17:35] value could it then be also me of
[17:37] exchange I've never I've heard this
[17:40] argument a few times but I've never
[17:42] really understood it to be honest I've
[17:45] I've never really understood why the
[17:47] fact that a lot of people own it that
[17:51] that would definitely create a very
[17:52] thick order book right and and therefore
[17:55] the the
[17:56] movements you know when a much is
[17:59] created should be shorter and smaller
[18:02] that's for sure but it wouldn't change
[18:05] the fact that if the demand of liquidity
[18:08] changes and and it has changed for me I
[18:10] have needed liquidity when the price was
[18:13] here H if the demand of liquidity
[18:15] changes for a number of folks at a
[18:17] particular number of uh you know a point
[18:20] in time then the demand of Bitcoin will
[18:23] change and and and that would mean that
[18:26] you know the price will go here but the
[18:27] supply will not move
[18:29] right and that will create a a spike in
[18:31] the price that will be very significant
[18:34] I I I'm not able to get around this fact
[18:37] you know I I'm not able to get
[18:39] around the fact that the supply is fixed
[18:42] um any longer even if many many people
[18:46] own it I I haven't been able to
[18:49] understand why having a lot of people
[18:51] owning it should change this again the
[18:54] order book idea yes I get it but the
[18:57] demand in in in liquidity is very
[19:00] changing you know it changes a lot and
[19:02] even for example in a in times of a
[19:05] crisis you know when when people start
[19:08] you know paying attention to to the fact
[19:10] that the economy is you know shaking and
[19:13] all that and they want you know
[19:16] liquidity right the liquidity will spike
[19:19] a lot and therefore the price should go
[19:21] very high and and and the change the
[19:24] opposite should should happen as well
[19:26] when when everything is stable people
[19:27] would gradually demand L liquidity and
[19:30] go after assets that would yield some
[19:34] interesting H profitability over time
[19:37] and or invest in businesses or whatever
[19:41] H that would change the demand as well
[19:43] and the demand would for liquidity would
[19:45] go downwards and therefore since the
[19:48] price doesn't move then you wouldn't
[19:50] have a stability any longer but again I
[19:52] don't
[19:53] mean I am right or I am wrong I just
[19:56] haven't been able to properly understand
[19:59] how the fact that so many people would
[20:01] hold it should change this Dynamic I I
[20:05] don't get it and and I haven't been able
[20:08] to find someone that really gives me an
[20:11] argument that I should H totally buy I
[20:14] haven't and and therefore I'm just a
[20:16] skeptical I'm I'm not either 100% either
[20:20] on one side or in the other I'm just way
[20:22] more skeptical than I was and also
[20:24] because of this personal experience that
[20:26] I told you H way more skeptical than I
[20:30] was just a few years back yeah I mean if
[20:34] Bitcoin always stays volatile it will
[20:37] never be a med of exchange and unit of
[20:39] account in a big way like that's I
[20:41] totally agree with fact that that's um a
[20:44] no brainer for me like if if Bitcoin
[20:46] changes like 10 20% in a month it cannot
[20:50] be a unit of account long term people
[20:52] will still transac in it uh people will
[20:54] still use it but it will not be a
[20:56] general accept the currency I I was like
[20:58] um my my thought was always like um it
[21:02] is right now volatile but when you look
[21:04] at gold for example um it's way less
[21:08] volatile uh what if what happens if like
[21:10] the like that's high pae and it takes a
[21:13] long time but if like we have the
[21:16] singularity of money coming to fruition
[21:18] where like at some point all the wealth
[21:21] is stored in in in in kind of one
[21:24] vehicle and Bitcoin actually sucks up
[21:26] like the financial energy of real estate
[21:29] and and gold and all that things which
[21:32] um I think but it's a long way and a
[21:35] hard way and nothing maybe not happens
[21:38] in my lifetime even though I'm very
[21:39] young um but what if that happens then
[21:43] there's like so much money in there so
[21:46] that it hardly moves when we look at
[21:50] bitcoin's history me we kind of already
[21:52] see that a little bit 15 years is not a
[21:54] lot of history um but when IL musk in
[21:57] 2021 came in
[21:59] uh it moved a lot like this was the
[22:01] richest man alive uh back then I think
[22:04] even now and he said like oh yes I want
[22:07] to buy uh Bitcoin I like it accept it
[22:09] for Teslas all that stuff and I think
[22:12] price moved up like 30% like something
[22:14] crazy and then like a few weeks later
[22:16] he's like ah I don't I'm not sure about
[22:18] that environment thing which was
[22:21] completely interesting uh to see uh and
[22:25] then the price actually moved back down
[22:27] to exactly where it was before him which
[22:29] was also very interesting to see but
[22:31] there you could see like Bitcoin is a
[22:33] very small asset still and one guy has a
[22:37] major impact on the price yeah even now
[22:40] I feel like the this impact is now less
[22:43] like even if like Jeff bz or ilas comes
[22:45] out and does something the impact would
[22:48] be less but I could be wrong maybe
[22:50] depends on like when Apple now comes out
[22:52] and says like oh 5% of our balance sheet
[22:54] tomorrow will be converted to bitcoin or
[22:57] was converted to bitcoin like the last
[22:59] quarter probably that's more realistic
[23:01] that would massively influence the price
[23:04] we talking like I think hundreds of
[23:06] percents of uh of of gains and also like
[23:09] volatility along the way um I'm I'm just
[23:12] thinking like uh it it could go to a a
[23:16] size that might change that fact but I
[23:20] agree with you like totally like as long
[23:22] as it stays volatile there's no chance
[23:24] that it gets a me of exchange well
[23:26] there's no way around the fact that uh
[23:28] many people are in Bitcoin simply
[23:30] speculating right and and we should be
[23:33] frank about this fact I am I am in love
[23:36] with The Cypher Punk vision of enabling
[23:40] trust to scale by removing these trust
[23:43] intermediaries right and and this is
[23:45] what I'm love with with with regards to
[23:47] bitcoin and what I'm in love with with
[23:49] regards to to liquid but it doesn't
[23:53] change the fact that many people are
[23:54] simply here because when the price goes
[23:57] up they want to be in the vagon right
[24:00] and and and and and that people change
[24:03] their mind with regards to an asset if
[24:06] Elon Musk gives them their their his
[24:09] endorsement or Jeff bethos or any of
[24:12] those folks H it doesn't change mine one
[24:15] bit you know my my view with regards to
[24:17] bitcoin if v m i don't I couldn't care
[24:20] less I have a Clear Vision on what
[24:23] Bitcoin is for me and how it changes the
[24:27] world and and I want to be that vum for
[24:29] those reasons so um in fact you could
[24:33] argue that the fact that they move so
[24:36] fast it is actually the consequence of
[24:38] so many people playing with a casino on
[24:41] bitcoin but it who who cares it's part
[24:45] of any new asset any new asset has
[24:48] speculation people looking forward
[24:51] specul right the specularity means
[24:53] looking forward some someone says said
[24:55] this in bitco in Spanish Bitcoin and I
[24:58] love the sentence because it means
[25:00] you're are looking into the future
[25:01] specul and and and and folks that think
[25:04] that they are on the right side are
[25:06] making bets and and you know hoping that
[25:09] it will increase in price that's okay
[25:12] those that are right will be gaining
[25:14] money and those that fail will lose it
[25:17] but those of us that are in here because
[25:19] they see value at owning Bitcoin I I I
[25:23] find it valuable to own Bitcoin right
[25:26] because it it it pro it enables
[25:28] exchanges for me that are not possible
[25:31] otherwise it enables exchanges when when
[25:34] I'm talking about exchanges I mean both
[25:36] person to person me to you but also with
[25:40] me and myself in the future right and
[25:42] and and therefore I'm I'm way super
[25:46] happy to own Bitcoin and I think that's
[25:48] where the value is and and um the fact
[25:52] that I think it is not generally
[25:54] accepted means of exchange or the fact
[25:56] that there are many people using it as a
[25:59] casino doesn't change that fact one bit
[26:01] right so yeah how how will Bitcoin
[26:04] change the world yeah it will change the
[26:07] world because again it will enable
[26:09] exchanges that are not possible
[26:11] otherwise and this is what I see with
[26:14] liquid and I find it fascinating with
[26:18] liquid if you think about it or let let
[26:21] me let me let me try to explain to you
[26:24] what I find awesome about liquid and and
[26:27] because it's a exactly the same idea
[26:29] that I described about Bitcoin if I step
[26:31] back I I would say yeah Bitcoin enables
[26:33] private property it enables us to to own
[26:36] something without the need for any loss
[26:39] which is an institution it removes the
[26:41] need for that institution and therefore
[26:43] I can own property here where I live I
[26:45] can own property in your country in any
[26:47] other country in the world and and
[26:50] nobody can H you know prevent that from
[26:54] from from happening prevent that from
[26:57] happening so a so what happens is that
[27:00] there are many other exchanges there are
[27:02] many other many institutions that we can
[27:04] get rid of and let trust scale and one
[27:08] of of those institutions is financial
[27:10] markets markets are also an institution
[27:12] because it's again a number of rules and
[27:14] protocols that enables strangers to to
[27:17] interact with each other and and
[27:19] financial markets are a very powerful
[27:21] one in fact it is extremely powerful
[27:25] because you could argue that in many
[27:27] emerging countries the lack of these
[27:30] institutions such such as financial
[27:32] markets with proper rule of law is what
[27:34] is preventing many of the very valuable
[27:38] assets that those countries have to
[27:40] connect with global liquidity and by
[27:42] being unable to connect with global
[27:44] liquidity there is no money flowing in
[27:47] and there they cannot bootst let's say
[27:49] their their economies right so so what I
[27:53] think liquid can enable is
[27:55] to make countries in emerg
[27:59] economies with very lean regulatory
[28:02] bodies to to enforce the right of an
[28:05] asset you for example I own land in in
[28:08] an emerging country and and I want to
[28:12] develop a real estate project and if if
[28:15] with very little loss you know with very
[28:18] the need for very little loss and a very
[28:20] lean regulatory body that does thing
[28:23] correct you can
[28:25] then connect the asset in a digital H
[28:29] form you know there would be an article
[28:32] is a trusted intermediary but it would
[28:34] be way less than what it's needed
[28:37] currently in Europe or the US to enable
[28:40] financial markets you know in order to
[28:42] to enable financial markets in the EU or
[28:43] the US you need a massive regulatory
[28:46] body you need a National Stock Exchange
[28:49] you need a Clearing House a a Central
[28:52] Security depositary a settlement system
[28:55] that includes the Central Bank and a a
[28:57] huge number of regulatory bodies
[29:01] supervision
[29:03] auditing lawyers anything a huge number
[29:06] of of things and that system is
[29:09] extremely costly and it's so costly that
[29:11] it's making all those emerging countries
[29:14] not being able to enable financial
[29:16] markets Advanced Financial markets so a
[29:20] a system like liquid that is secure
[29:22] because it uses bitcoin's codebase utxo
[29:25] model and a number of other things can
[29:28] enable a very lean regulatory body in an
[29:30] emerging country to connect the local
[29:33] assets with global liquidity you know
[29:36] with Global Investors and therefore let
[29:38] money get in and bootstrap truly
[29:41] economies and and we've seen this on
[29:44] liquid with a number of assets and it's
[29:47] fascinating because H lenders for
[29:50] example in Mexico uh you know
[29:53] non-banking financial institutions that
[29:55] that are lending to individuals and in
[29:58] in in Mexico H were not
[30:02] able to land any longer despite having
[30:06] owning a lot of collateral you know what
[30:08] is called promisory notes and and all of
[30:11] a sudden thanks to liquid these these
[30:15] assets can moved can be moved and used
[30:17] as collateral via token by being a token
[30:20] and this completely blew my mind because
[30:22] all of a sudden these non-banking
[30:24] financial institutions can lend way more
[30:27] way more more into the Mexican economy
[30:30] so so we're and and he thanks that to to
[30:32] US Banks and US funds lending money
[30:36] through liquid onto these non-banking
[30:38] financial institution so we are
[30:40] basically connecting very valuable
[30:42] assets thanks to a law in Mexico that
[30:44] makes them very H strong from the legal
[30:47] standpoint with global liquidity you
[30:49] know and it it really blows my mind so
[30:52] and it even made me change the focus of
[30:55] my work you know I I I was you know
[30:58] chasing traditional financial
[31:00] institutions in Europe and and and the
[31:02] us but I realized that what with a truly
[31:05] secure blockchains for financial markets
[31:07] where it really solves a problem is in
[31:09] emerging economies right so it that is
[31:12] the to respond your
[31:14] question if you want to buy the Assets
[31:16] in the in liquid you will need Li you
[31:19] will need Bitcoin you know so it will
[31:21] enable exchanges that are not possible
[31:24] otherwise it is already enabling
[31:26] exchanges that are not possible
[31:28] otherwise you know and it's enabling um
[31:31] many other use cases that we are seeing
[31:33] coming you know where ER the need H for
[31:37] trust laws are what makes you you know
[31:41] choose where where to put your trust you
[31:43] know if if if there is a law it will
[31:45] tell you you can trust this institution
[31:48] because it's supervised it's regulated
[31:49] you know blah blah blah all that you
[31:51] know but if there's no law you don't
[31:53] know who to trust so in order to reach
[31:55] consensus that's where a blockchain a
[31:57] secure block really solves a problem and
[31:59] that is needed in these kind of
[32:00] countries you know where there there's
[32:02] no such loss you know and and this is
[32:05] what blowing my mind because it's
[32:07] exactly matches the what I think Bitcoin
[32:09] is solving you know
[32:11] and yeah so so it's it's about I didn't
[32:15] use Liquid before H joining H
[32:18] blockstream but as I understood it I'm
[32:20] I'm a hardcore user right now you know
[32:22] and so I'm using already Bitcoin as an
[32:25] exchange a means of exchange for assets
[32:28] that are not possible otherwise this is
[32:30] this is what I mean by that thank you
[32:32] you already made it halfway through the
[32:33] video and I'm really really grateful to
[32:36] have you here two things make this
[32:38] channel possible you as a watcher and
[32:40] listener who keep supporting this
[32:42] Channel and another one is all the
[32:44] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[32:46] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[32:49] very start and where I personally buy my
[32:51] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[32:53] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[32:55] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[32:59] simplest and securest way to secure your
[33:02] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[33:04] only 2% of bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin
[33:07] in a hardware wallet how crazy is that
[33:09] don't be in that 98% bracket be in the
[33:13] 2% bracket and if you have self custody
[33:15] and you know your friend does not have
[33:17] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[33:19] he needs a birthday present and a small
[33:21] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[33:23] 5% off your order plus you support my
[33:27] channel and now let's get back to the
[33:29] video that's interesting um maybe for
[33:32] those who who don't know much about
[33:34] liquid how does it work what exactly is
[33:37] it and let's make it uh uh for them
[33:40] understandable sure liquid is a side
[33:42] chain of of Bitcoin right and H
[33:45] basically what um it means this means is
[33:48] that if a blockchain by by definition uh
[33:52] does shouldn't try to achieve uh
[33:55] security decentralization and ability on
[33:58] the same chain because that could and in
[34:02] fact does compromise the security of the
[34:05] Native token and if you are if you think
[34:08] that the security of that native token
[34:10] is very important as we all think with
[34:12] regards to bitcoin H then it's it would
[34:15] be a bad idea to enable that scalability
[34:18] and fancy functionalities for financial
[34:21] markets on top of the same blockchain
[34:24] where where the native token is is is
[34:27] stored and therefore that's why um H the
[34:31] founders of blockstream decided that the
[34:32] best way forward would be to to enable
[34:35] that kind of fancy features and
[34:37] scalability on our second layer the way
[34:39] it works is that you lock Bitcoins on a
[34:42] a address controlled by a number of
[34:45] companies which are the members of the
[34:47] Federation that that manages the liquid
[34:50] Network and then it gets unlocked on the
[34:53] liquid network with different protocol
[34:54] rules and different by different
[34:56] protocol rules I mean faster cheaper you
[34:59] know and with all these up codes with
[35:03] the the ability to program very
[35:05] interesting logic to the transactions
[35:08] you know that is not possible on bitcoin
[35:10] main chain but securely unlike on other
[35:13] blockchains and and uh liquid is again
[35:17] managed by currently around 80 companies
[35:20] 80 companies that are organized in a
[35:22] federation and this Federation has three
[35:24] boards and they vote in those uh boards
[35:27] whenever they want to propose you know
[35:30] the a new member joining um new rules or
[35:34] to change the technology road map of of
[35:36] liquid you know and they vote there and
[35:38] they make this decisions interestingly
[35:40] this consensus
[35:42] model has of course uh the disadvantage
[35:46] over Bitcoin that it's not entirely
[35:50] decentralized but on the other hand it
[35:53] is a proven model because it's exactly
[35:56] the way the con ens model that manages
[35:58] nationalized stock exchanges Clearing
[36:00] Houses depositaries and even central
[36:03] banks central banks are actually in fact
[36:05] many of them at least are Federation of
[36:07] members federations of members you know
[36:09] and those members are the ones that take
[36:11] the
[36:11] decisions H with regards to the central
[36:13] bank yeah that's the the way it works
[36:15] and and the the the goal of liquid is
[36:19] basically enabling these Advanced
[36:20] Financial applications that are not
[36:22] possible otherwise you know by removing
[36:23] all those trusted intermediaries
[36:25] intermediaries that I if you think about
[36:27] all those trusted intermediaries are
[36:29] nothing more than a recordkeeping
[36:32] companies you know they keep a ledger
[36:33] basically you know with lots of controls
[36:35] lots of supervision lots of but we can
[36:37] turn all those ledgers into just one you
[36:40] know and and all those federations into
[36:42] just one and that's what liquid does you
[36:44] know liquid enables just that and what
[36:47] we are seeing right now is to I would
[36:49] frame it as two categories mainly one is
[36:52] scalability use cases which is you know
[36:55] using Bitcoin to pay or or to buy things
[36:59] faster and cheaper or to balance payment
[37:01] channels for example or you know many
[37:03] other use cases that are part of the
[37:05] scalability category that I would call
[37:08] and there other use cases which are
[37:10] capital markets you know and most of my
[37:12] focus is capital markets and and it's
[37:15] basically enable you know that those
[37:17] interesting Assets in any country to be
[37:19] connected to Global Investors right and
[37:22] that's where I think liquid excels and
[37:25] and precisely if I may add the key
[37:28] differentiating factor of liquid of
[37:30] other over other
[37:32] blockchains is that if you if you want
[37:35] to need loss the least you need to have
[37:40] you know security paranoid approach to
[37:42] software development you know and that's
[37:44] what we have in in Bitcoin right and
[37:46] that's what liquid inherits by by using
[37:48] its code base so so yeah it is funny
[37:53] because I typically travel to these
[37:55] places in trafa in Europe or the US and
[37:57] then they say you know technology is a
[38:00] commodity technology the blockchain that
[38:02] is going to be used in financial markets
[38:04] is a commodity and they couldn't be more
[38:06] wrong in my opinion and the reason why
[38:08] they're wrong in my opinion is
[38:10] because they are used to regulating
[38:14] absolutely everything the the EU has the
[38:17] power to regulate anything right they
[38:19] have all the lawyers they need all the
[38:21] Regulators all the supervision that is
[38:23] needed could be needed to regulate
[38:25] anything and if you can regulate any
[38:27] anything you don't need security because
[38:29] whenever a smart contract is going to
[38:31] break there will be someone to regulate
[38:34] what happens when things break but
[38:36] instead in an emerging country if they
[38:38] don't have the legal enforcement and
[38:40] apparatus to to regulate what happens
[38:42] when things break that's when when they
[38:44] choose security paranoid blockchains you
[38:47] know and and that's where the value is
[38:50] in my opinion and that's also why in
[38:53] Bitcoin the security is totally paranoid
[38:56] you know the if you don't if you want to
[38:58] totally remove the need for any trusted
[39:01] intermediaries then security has been
[39:04] completely crazy and that's what in my
[39:07] opinion Nick Sab always means when he
[39:09] says trusted intermediaries are trusted
[39:12] third parties are security holes right
[39:13] it's really interesting and and I feel
[39:15] like when when we talk about uh side
[39:17] chains uh second layers and all all
[39:20] those scaling solutions to bitcoin um
[39:23] most people usually think about
[39:26] lightning first like they they have like
[39:28] the lightning apps and lightning is a
[39:30] really big name in the space how does it
[39:33] um how's it different to light how
[39:35] liquid different use cases are they
[39:38] complimentary to each other like how
[39:39] does this work yeah lightning is great
[39:43] for the means of exchange use case for
[39:46] for the usual one for payments you know
[39:48] but but but that's lining with regards
[39:50] to bitcoin but I see lightning nowadays
[39:53] as as simply a not simply but a great
[39:56] technology for any utxo based model ER
[40:00] model asset and and that is Bitcoin but
[40:03] it's also any liquid asset you know so
[40:05] for me right now even if you know we
[40:08] have a service that is green light that
[40:10] enables lightning Network as a service
[40:12] so if anyone doesn't want H to to run a
[40:16] lightning network node they they would
[40:19] hire us and they they can enable that
[40:21] non-custodial you know which is great
[40:23] and that serving that service is growing
[40:25] with regards to bitcoin but but now for
[40:28] me it's even more interesting to enable
[40:30] lightning on liquid for any asset that
[40:33] requires maximum throughput you know so
[40:36] for example H we have a number of stable
[40:39] coins there is particularly one I cannot
[40:42] talk about it yet unfortunately but uh
[40:44] there is one that
[40:46] is I think it's going to grow a lot you
[40:48] know over the next few months and and I
[40:52] expect hopefully to be a problem to
[40:55] become a problem in terms of throughput
[40:57] on liquid and that at some point will
[41:01] force us to implement a lightning
[41:04] Network for that particular asset and
[41:06] hopefully I I like that kind of problems
[41:09] right and and and for any other asset
[41:12] that grows enough to make the space in
[41:15] the blocks uh too expensive right and
[41:18] that's what liqu lightning is it's a
[41:19] great scalability solution for any
[41:22] situation where a throughput is a
[41:25] problem and and liquid is just a liquid
[41:29] You could argue that it is partially
[41:31] great for throughput but where it is
[41:33] actually great in my opinion is to
[41:35] enable different means of exchange use
[41:38] cases not only payments but also buying
[41:40] these assets that can yield a a profit
[41:43] that can make you enable you to own
[41:46] Assets in companies in in debt in land
[41:49] in whatever you know asset that can be a
[41:53] let's say tokenized interesting it's
[41:56] it's like this the this topic there are
[41:58] so many factors already in like it's
[42:00] it's uh even for someone like me like
[42:02] that's kind of involved in all all the
[42:04] things like it it kind of gets it's
[42:08] chaotic um then there's two other things
[42:12] uh that also come up sometimes on my
[42:14] podcast this is fediman and Arc how how
[42:18] different are though like fediman like
[42:20] the Federation system it sounds a little
[42:22] bit like liquid uh when you talk about
[42:24] it how does those
[42:27] compare to be honest I don't know much
[42:30] about ER fedy Min I haven't been uh
[42:33] looking at it but but simply because
[42:36] since I most of my work is with regards
[42:39] to Capital
[42:40] markets in regards to Capital markets ER
[42:44] fed Min is is not there what what
[42:47] capital markets are currently looking at
[42:49] is mostly other blockchains you know and
[42:52] and that's where I think we have a a
[42:55] huge market and a massive
[42:58] that is where we can grow the most so I
[43:00] haven't been paying attention to fine I
[43:02] have to be entirely honest with regards
[43:04] to Ark I think it's in very early stages
[43:06] but it's very promising you know and I
[43:08] think um it is Marco um from bpam that
[43:13] it's looking at it and I like Marco a
[43:15] lot you know and if he's putting his
[43:17] eyes into this I think it's it has great
[43:20] chances of being great and I certainly
[43:22] hope so but again I I haven't deep dived
[43:26] that much into our either I think it's
[43:28] still early stages it is promising
[43:31] simply because of the people that are
[43:33] are on top of it again not because I
[43:35] think I have a strong opinion but it's
[43:37] great and I hope that experimentation
[43:40] keeps happening and that we keep H
[43:42] finding er er the proper tradeoffs for
[43:45] each H use case you know I think that in
[43:49] blockchains is all about trade-offs and
[43:51] this
[43:51] is it is not about finding because for
[43:54] example some people ask me yeah you
[43:56] think that security is is Paramount to
[43:59] enable financial markets and all that
[44:02] but tether runs mostly on Tron you know
[44:05] and I'm like yeah but you know but
[44:07] Security on TR sucks but but for a
[44:09] payment of you know of $20 or $100 you
[44:14] know security is not really a big issue
[44:16] right I'm talking about really massive
[44:19] amounts of of value you know assets that
[44:21] are worth billions or or or trillions
[44:24] you know in liquid the total value lock
[44:26] right now is 1.7 billion already you
[44:30] know and many people in the Bitcoin
[44:31] space are not even aware of this you
[44:33] know and we have many kinds of assets
[44:35] already and is valuable assets that are
[44:38] being used as as collateral and and
[44:42] stable coins are way more than this but
[44:44] scattered across many different
[44:46] blockchains you know so every blockchain
[44:49] has a different H tradeoff and depending
[44:52] on the use case you need to enable you
[44:55] will need one tradeoff of or the other
[44:57] right and and that's where I think we
[45:00] will find use cases for Arc hopefully H
[45:03] we will find use cases for Fint and
[45:05] others and I think that we keep we need
[45:08] to keep exploring where each blockchain
[45:12] Act does actually solve a
[45:14] problem yeah and I think this is the the
[45:17] the main takeaway always for me like we
[45:19] have to keep innovating we have to keep
[45:21] uh uh trying to find new ways to do
[45:25] things uh because we are so early in
[45:27] that space with Bitcoin uh and uh nobody
[45:30] 100% knows what the future looks like
[45:33] and how we we will do it in like 20 50
[45:36] 100 years but it's always fun to to
[45:37] speculate about that and always fun to
[45:39] talk about that uh and my main takeaway
[45:42] is always like let's let's keep
[45:45] researching let's keep innovating Al
[45:47] like Mar
[45:49] a something like that uh he's also on
[45:53] the already was on the podcast so if you
[45:55] just like Ty in my my channel Marco you
[45:58] you will you will find it in my library
[45:59] for everyone watching and listening um
[46:02] we have before we start in the endro te
[46:04] uh one question that is always getting
[46:06] like all all my guests are getting um it
[46:09] aims for getting something else outside
[46:12] of of Bitcoin and outside of the things
[46:14] that we already talked in the podcast in
[46:15] the podcast um what can we learn from
[46:18] you besides Bitcoin liquid and all the
[46:21] things that we talked about for for me
[46:24] personally yeah whatever you want to
[46:26] talk about outside of that drum okay
[46:30] yeah you I I managed a weather company
[46:32] for six years uh so and most of our
[46:36] services were with regards to energy
[46:38] markets H because it's it's critical you
[46:41] know the weather for you know wind power
[46:44] and solar power and how it impacts the
[46:47] price at you know the wholesale price in
[46:49] the markets so and that's also the
[46:51] reason why I I very quickly and very
[46:54] early saw the the synergy is between
[46:58] Bitcoin mining and the energy markets so
[47:00] with regards to energy markets and
[47:02] weather uh I think I can hopefully be
[47:05] helpful for whoever wants to know a
[47:07] little bit more about
[47:09] that that's interest like a weather
[47:11] company what what do a weather company
[47:13] doing I never heard that but yeah yeah
[47:15] weather companies I mean weather affects
[47:18] any any outdoor activity right so we
[47:21] work with energy markets the most
[47:23] because it's where most money is but
[47:25] also with ship transport portation Road
[47:28] Transportation airports insurance
[47:31] companies agriculture you name it and
[47:35] and what basically you you do is you use
[47:38] weather models numerical models and H
[47:41] try to find correlations with h business
[47:45] variables right and in this case that I
[47:48] mentioned it would be power production
[47:50] for wind power for solar power and all
[47:54] these things but with regards to to AR
[47:56] ulture it would be for example things
[47:59] with regards to the soil the humidity of
[48:01] the soil the the variables the
[48:03] temperature in the soil the temperature
[48:05] you know centers certain sensors with
[48:08] Center sensors and many other things and
[48:11] that kind of mixture of different
[48:13] variables when you mix it with the
[48:16] production or for example with the
[48:18] ability to I remember a very funny use
[48:21] case which which was for example a
[48:22] retail company in Canada H they always
[48:25] run out of stock of barbecue stuff you
[48:28] know like sausages and all these things
[48:30] whenever the sun came out and decent
[48:32] temperatures you know and they wanted to
[48:34] be able to to keep in stock enough so
[48:38] that they could sell it all you know
[48:39] when when the time come you know when
[48:42] the weather is appropriate and therefore
[48:45] um they wanted our service to to be able
[48:47] to provide decision support systems what
[48:50] we provided the the deliverable for
[48:53] customers were was a decision support
[48:55] system so basically the person making a
[48:57] decision with regards to the price of
[49:00] energy the the insurance the price of an
[49:02] insurance or the the operations behind
[49:05] the back end the back office for
[49:07] insurance management and these kind of
[49:10] things all these people's these people
[49:12] that are making decisions need an easy
[49:14] support system that tells them hey do
[49:16] this within this time window don't do
[49:19] this with here use this price here you
[49:22] know so basically all kinds of web based
[49:24] or mobile based fun tools that enabled
[49:27] make them to make good decisions there
[49:30] were or even for example gas Traders I
[49:34] mean there's a myriad of people using
[49:36] weather information you wouldn't believe
[49:37] it but it's a tiny sector it's a very
[49:40] small industry so not that many many
[49:42] people know it that's that's really
[49:45] interesting uh that's that's almost
[49:47] worth a a full
[49:50] podcast so many questions around that
[49:52] but we we have to come to the endro te
[49:55] totally uh um our tin is where the
[49:57] previous guest is asking a question for
[49:59] the next guest without knowing who the
[50:00] next guest actually is H the question
[50:03] for you is what could the future of
[50:05] humanity look like when we have access
[50:07] to Limitless power on a Bitcoin
[50:10] standard wow what would be a what would
[50:13] Humanity look like if there is Limitless
[50:16] power but is it is the idea if we get
[50:19] for example fusion fusion power and and
[50:23] how we would I I don't see the
[50:25] relationship between the Bitcoin
[50:27] standard and the having Fusion other
[50:30] than it would we would have very cheap
[50:32] power prices but infrastructure would
[50:35] still need to be paid for right so it's
[50:37] very expensive to build a a nuclear
[50:39] fusion reactor so is it's not even
[50:43] possible yet but uh but um if we would
[50:46] get it well look I'm a optimistic I'm a
[50:49] rational optimistic so what I believe is
[50:52] that we humans H solve problems we are
[50:55] great at solving problems we are we are
[50:57] able to create explanatory knowledge as
[50:59] my favorite author David Deutsch always
[51:02] says and that means that whatever is a
[51:06] problem with regards to anything we will
[51:10] figure it out we will figure it out we
[51:12] only need to have good ideas and that's
[51:15] why I'm a great defendant of the West
[51:18] the ideas of the West you know of the
[51:20] Western countries and I think they are
[51:22] under threat right now you know and I'm
[51:25] and what I think that whatever the
[51:27] problem is you know expensive energy or
[51:31] cheap energy I think that what it's
[51:33] important is that we Prevail we keep um
[51:38] the error correction mechanisms and and
[51:41] in the west what what I think that has
[51:43] made us progress in within the last 300
[51:46] years is the tradition of criticism you
[51:48] know we are able to criticize we should
[51:50] be able to criticize and have free
[51:52] speech for that you know and and any
[51:55] kind of problem it that one or any other
[51:58] can be solved if we keep that in mind
[52:00] okay so let's keep Western values in
[52:02] place and let's protect them and let's
[52:05] keep any threat away from here because
[52:07] it's been good so far and let's H keep
[52:11] progress happening that's what I would
[52:12] say absolutely freedom of speech is so
[52:15] important it's it's it's very very
[52:17] important uh before I let you go where
[52:19] can people find you if they want to
[52:21] reach out to you and have questions I'm
[52:23] not very active lately I was very active
[52:26] before on on Twitter but I'm not any
[52:28] longer so you can find me on LinkedIn
[52:31] but also on the B2 community that blog
[52:34] stream enabl for both um Court lightning
[52:37] and and liquid uh so yeah both places
[52:41] perfect then yeah thank you for joining
[52:43] us today and also for everyone watching
[52:44] and listening thank you for joining us
[52:46] today I'll be back tomorrow with another
[52:48] episode bye-bye
