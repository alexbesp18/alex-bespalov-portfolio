[00:00] there are some customers that want to
[00:02] sell their homes and buy Bitcoin why my
[00:05] salary from one week to another just
[00:06] lost 30% of purchase power I think it's
[00:09] a great opportunity here because
[00:11] probably your sons are going to ask you
[00:14] why you didn't bought Bitcoin when it
[00:17] was 10,000 it's obvious that this going
[00:19] to be go up at the beginning it was one
[00:21] PES or $1 and the weekend later it was
[00:24] instead of one pesos it was four pesos
[00:26] it was a caros now actually 23 years
[00:30] years later is $1 is
[00:33] 1,230 pesos bitcoiners know that that is
[00:35] not the best solution but many in
[00:37] general people think that US dollar is
[00:39] the best solution I'm still crazy for
[00:41] many people because I I just still after
[00:44] 10 years they don't get it yeah you will
[00:46] have one headache every four years but
[00:48] then you will have many happy
[00:53] times you are I don't know like kind of
[00:56] a legend 10 years uh you're making
[00:59] Bitcoin cont content uh in in Spanish
[01:02] are you did you start with Bitcoin or
[01:04] like even or crypto and blockchain in
[01:06] general or how do do you start well at
[01:09] that time it didn't exist crypto so it
[01:12] was Bitcoin
[01:15] only so yeah um yeah it was I I started
[01:20] by by an error actually because I was
[01:23] looking for a job uh I I was graduated
[01:26] as Industrial Engineer and then I I did
[01:29] some entrepreneurs uh entrepreneurships
[01:32] and then I I started working on a
[01:34] company to develop uh as a product
[01:37] manager to develop uh content apps for
[01:41] for American uh clients uh and then I I
[01:46] was tired I want to change and I I put
[01:49] my profile
[01:51] in um I I just forgot uh the the the
[01:56] website uh to look for jobs you know um
[02:00] so there I receive after a few month
[02:04] weeks I receive an email saying he we
[02:06] are looking for a person uh to be the
[02:11] Latin American uh you know uh business
[02:16] de for our company and uh and when I
[02:19] start reading about the company it was a
[02:21] company that at that time wanted to
[02:24] connect wanted to let people buy Bitcoin
[02:27] by uh via a brick and mortar store on
[02:32] the street okay so uh they want me to
[02:36] talk to to talk to this networks and so
[02:40] the those networks can connect to the to
[02:43] the to the company to the app and people
[02:47] can buy Bitcoin with cash in those
[02:50] networks those Bri mortar stores that
[02:53] you know in in Latin America they are
[02:55] quite common so well that's when I said
[02:59] okay what is this is what is bitcoin and
[03:01] I started doing some research a few
[03:03] month before with some conversations
[03:06] with friends we said oh Bitcoin you know
[03:09] it's very expensive it's 300 $300 so it
[03:13] was really really expensive at that time
[03:16] uh but then I said okay I'm going to
[03:18] jump on this and start uh working
[03:21] connecting with people in the industry
[03:23] in Argentina um at that time we were
[03:26] very few but it was very very energetic
[03:29] and with lot of uh um you know uh vision
[03:34] of the future of the potential of the
[03:35] technology because of our history uh so
[03:39] yeah I joined um this company for a few
[03:44] months and then I realized that I wanted
[03:46] to learn more and I didn't find any
[03:49] content so in Spanish so a few month
[03:52] later I got co-founded bet in espanol
[03:55] with a partner at that time and we start
[03:57] creating content essentially based on
[04:00] the on the book from Master in Bitcoin
[04:02] from Andreas anop the first version so
[04:05] we started reading content from there
[04:07] some videos in YouTube and we create
[04:09] without wanting to be we created the
[04:11] first V videos in Spanish in YouTube
[04:14] about Bitcoin and I think at that time
[04:18] uh in general Bitcoin content was quite
[04:20] rare right there was not a lot of videos
[04:22] there were not a lot of thing like I
[04:25] think for people that come into the
[04:26] space now it's kind of hard to
[04:28] understand because there's so many
[04:30] Bitcoin only content creators Bitcoin
[04:32] only U podcasters and and back then
[04:34] there was like yeah there was this one
[04:36] book and there was some other things but
[04:37] it was quite empty right yeah yeah
[04:41] essentially yeah so it was U you know
[04:45] very lonely uh
[04:48] trip but but we we knew that we were
[04:52] that that that was important for for the
[04:55] rest of the few of the next years and
[04:57] after many many years um so so so
[05:00] essentially we create um 24
[05:03] videos uh and then uh we stopped
[05:07] creating content for five years because
[05:10] I started working on the on the industry
[05:11] in different companies uh and that
[05:15] actually you know those videos were
[05:16] generating views uh organically uh and
[05:21] at before restarting in 2019 because in
[05:24] 2019 I restarted to to publish more
[05:28] content about before just with only 24
[05:32] videos we had 10,000 followers and many
[05:35] many views um and also we I co-create
[05:40] bet in Portugues bet in Portuguese so we
[05:44] create a few few videos there and and
[05:49] there are only 10 videos that are
[05:51] published but at that time we recorded
[05:54] 20 videos but we couldn't sell it to the
[05:57] sponsors because you know Bitcoin was
[06:00] going down and and you know there wasn't
[06:03] many support at that time for for
[06:06] creating content so yeah it's been a
[06:08] wild ride uh since the beginning and
[06:12] after many years lot of people of the
[06:14] community that are already working on on
[06:18] bitcoin or or creating educational
[06:21] content or creating companies they said
[06:23] H oh oh yeah I remember that I watch the
[06:26] First videos that I watched were from
[06:28] BET and Espanol
[06:30] so that that's uh that's you know it's a
[06:34] it's very very good to hear that at some
[06:37] point we add value uh to
[06:41] them yeah really really cool and and at
[06:43] that time you also lived in Argentina or
[06:46] you were already in Spain no no I I
[06:49] lived in in Argentina yeah yeah so so so
[06:52] you lived in a time in Argentina where
[06:54] you discovered Bitcoin where you also
[06:57] discovered the big problem with with Fe
[06:59] currencies uh in in the Argentine well
[07:02] actually I discovered the the
[07:04] inflationary problems before that before
[07:09] Bitcoin so as as as living in
[07:13] Argentina uh for like many years I mean
[07:16] 30 30 when when I was 32 I I I moved
[07:21] from Argentina uh actually sorry uh 34 I
[07:25] moved from Argentina so uh at that time
[07:30] uh yeah I I suffer many um you know
[07:34] inflationary situations and it was for
[07:37] me was like why my salary from one day
[07:40] to another one week to another just lost
[07:43] 30% of you
[07:45] know H buy buying buying purchas you
[07:49] know um sorry purchase power so I was
[07:54] like why is this I just wanted to to
[07:56] learn more and and then when I I
[07:59] realized that Bitcoin was a solution for
[08:01] that I said oh okay this sounds very
[08:05] interesting and I can tell you a sory
[08:08] like you know I was
[08:10] like uh seven years old and I used to
[08:13] work my my grandparents had a
[08:16] um a bakery so I used to help go there
[08:21] and I help them and I just you know do
[08:23] clean some things and and help them and
[08:26] they pay me in pesos Argentinian Pesos
[08:30] so uh at that time I said Okay I want to
[08:32] buy like a little toy you know it was
[08:35] the rumo toy you know and and I just
[08:39] want to want to do that and and I went
[08:41] to the toy store and I said okay how
[08:44] much is this and one day it was like 30
[08:48] and I said okay uh one week later I go
[08:52] back to buy it and it was like 55 you
[08:56] know it was like wow what what is going
[08:59] on I just I mean I cannot buy it now you
[09:02] know uh so it was
[09:06] that those type of issues that you know
[09:09] you I was only seven years so it was
[09:12] like you know it was very
[09:14] painful so um yeah and and then we had
[09:20] other situations throughout our life in
[09:22] 2001 we have one one big devaluation of
[09:27] at the beginning it was like one PES or
[09:28] $1 in a few weeks or weekend later it
[09:32] was one pesos was sorry $1 was instead
[09:36] of one pesos it was four pesos so it was
[09:40] a Cs and now now actually 23 years later
[09:46] is $1 is
[09:49] 1,230 pesos so you can imagine and that
[09:54] and it's so so
[09:57] internally uh uh assume and and Vivid
[10:01] for argentinians that we that is one of
[10:04] the reason why Bitcoin it was so popular
[10:08] or is so popular in
[10:11] Argentina how how popular is AR is
[10:15] Bitcoin in Argentina right now is it
[10:17] like if you had to guess an adoption
[10:20] rate is like more than 10 20% or is it
[10:22] maybe even like around 50% no so it's
[10:25] very low low yet still it still is very
[10:28] low
[10:30] um so not not many people uh accept
[10:34] Bitcoin that's the truth
[10:38] um but it's been a a a change when
[10:43] stable coins arrive because we had also
[10:48] uh throughout many of the history many
[10:52] people or I would say most of the people
[10:55] think that the US dollar is like a good
[10:58] uh given to save their uh to store their
[11:01] their savings we we bitcoiners know that
[11:04] that is not the best solution but many
[11:06] in general people think that US dollar
[11:09] is the best solution um so they usually
[11:13] started to be more uh user users for
[11:19] stable coins instead of Bitcoin so but
[11:22] you know that's the that's part of the
[11:24] evolution uh of moving forward to go
[11:28] from stab to bitcoin and and I think the
[11:32] use just the use of wallets uh uh you
[11:37] know to be uh custodial out out of
[11:40] custodial
[11:42] wallets um or noncustodial wallet that's
[11:47] that's a big step ER moving forward from
[11:51] most of the people and probably the next
[11:54] Evolution step is going to be to just
[11:56] use Bitcoin but for that we need to wait
[11:59] if sometime I remember in
[12:03] 2014 in January 2014 I went to the North
[12:07] American Bitcoin conference that it was
[12:09] the conference where vitalic butterin
[12:12] presented ethereum it was just a paper
[12:16] and at that time the main sponsor of the
[12:19] event was P pay and I remember listening
[12:23] to people and on the stage that you know
[12:25] you know uh we're in 2014 by 2020
[12:29] everybody everybody is going to use
[12:31] Bitcoin you know so that was the
[12:34] expectation and we know that that didn't
[12:37] happen uh so yeah I I heard many many ER
[12:43] how would you say that many wishes to to
[12:48] start you know that it's very easy to
[12:51] wish something know to make it fast uh
[12:54] but
[12:54] unfortunately uh you know what what I
[12:58] think is that one of the
[13:00] main handbreak that we have uh for a
[13:04] technology to be implemented is the the
[13:08] the human ability to accept changes so
[13:13] that's uh B you know we know that the
[13:16] technology needs to improve is improving
[13:18] that's fine but what I think is the
[13:21] hardest part is that the
[13:23] human uh adaptation to a change and that
[13:26] is not so easy after so many many
[13:29] decades of using one or centuries using
[13:33] one other system you know yeah it's
[13:36] interesting for me um when when I talk
[13:39] with people from Argentina or turkey
[13:41] where like there's a really high
[13:42] inflation rate um and they usually don't
[13:45] flee to bitcoin they more flee to like
[13:48] stable coins on us usdc or something
[13:50] like that uh because for them US dollar
[13:54] is like really safe even though it still
[13:56] has quite quite a lot of inflation but
[13:59] like not compared to to the arent peso
[14:01] or the Turkish lra so that's that's
[14:03] really interesting for me to to see why
[14:07] people flee to the next better one and
[14:10] not to the best one so like they they
[14:12] kind of want to have a little bit better
[14:14] not not not the best form like what as
[14:18] as you're from Argentina like why do you
[14:20] think that is like why do people go to
[14:23] like oh let's let's go to the US US
[14:25] dollar and and not directly go to like
[14:27] oh maybe bit coin with US dollar like
[14:30] it's there can be an argument made like
[14:32] 90% in Bitcoin and maybe 10% with usdc
[14:35] to have like something
[14:37] shter yeah that's very interesting
[14:39] question and that is the same question
[14:41] that I asked to my
[14:43] parents because yeah you know why why
[14:46] are why are you doing that you know and
[14:50] again that is that is so inside the the
[14:53] the mind their mindset and it's very
[14:56] difficult for them to change because for
[14:58] many decades uh the best place was to
[15:02] buy bit US Dollars and to have the bills
[15:06] at
[15:07] home and and without even in the bank
[15:10] because they already didn't trust on the
[15:12] bank and so
[15:16] um yeah so that's be and and you know
[15:21] there is
[15:22] some uh for many years the US economy
[15:26] was like the biggest one uh is still is
[15:28] the big biggest one but we know that
[15:31] this is this might might change uh but
[15:35] um there is some some kind of um how do
[15:39] you say that sense of they are doing
[15:43] things the right way or they are doing
[15:45] things better than us and at some point
[15:48] it makes sense because you have the huge
[15:50] economy worldwide economy versus
[15:52] Argentina economy is very small you have
[15:56] uh you know uh you need to find
[15:59] something else that is stronger than you
[16:02] so uh and and also is accepted all over
[16:05] the world so and you can fly to Europe
[16:09] you can fly to anywhere to Brazil and
[16:11] they accept dollars everywhere they
[16:13] accept dollars so yeah and and if the
[16:17] doll the dollar you have the US dollar
[16:20] like a bill and you know is much better
[16:24] than having a pesos that go up that go
[16:26] down that go down and generally goes up
[16:29] because you need more pesos to buy one
[16:32] one Bitcoin one dollar sorry so yeah um
[16:38] that is something that uh it's
[16:41] complicated and and it's I I think over
[16:46] time is people are asking more
[16:50] questions and I also yeah I I'm still
[16:54] crazy for many people because I I just
[16:57] you know still after 10 years so they
[17:01] just you know they don't get it
[17:04] yet it's it's fascinating because
[17:06] especially if you see the purchasing
[17:09] power increase over 10 years in Bitcoin
[17:11] it's like it's pretty obvious the best
[17:15] choice against everything else um and
[17:18] you talked about how people in 2014 said
[17:22] like oh in 2020 we will have mass
[17:24] adoption and then everything like that
[17:27] obviously that turned out to be wrong um
[17:30] what do you think is an an realistic
[17:33] expectation of when we get to a point
[17:36] where most people have Bitcoin as a
[17:39] store of value and it's kind of getting
[17:42] more and more accepted in in in
[17:43] restaurant and bars uh I mean right now
[17:46] we the store of value aspect really
[17:48] plays out uh quite quickly now with like
[17:51] companies coming in ETFs coming in and
[17:53] and even countries with El Salvador
[17:55] coming in in buying Bitcoin um but what
[17:59] what would you say is like a realistic
[18:00] expectation of of when does this happen
[18:03] so I I I think it's about incentives uh
[18:07] so I don't know um I don't know I don't
[18:12] have a timing uh but if something really
[18:17] hurts on your business in your pocket to
[18:20] your pocket trust me that you're going
[18:22] to find whatever way you will
[18:27] have at your dis proposal to solve that
[18:31] problem so if you know you have a bank
[18:34] account you have money and the
[18:35] government just said okay you cannot
[18:38] take that money you just take uh I don't
[18:41] know 1% every week of that money trust
[18:44] me that you are going to start looking
[18:46] for other options okay so that that's is
[18:50] what what motivates Argentinian because
[18:52] that what happened in 2001 you couldn't
[18:55] take all your money off your bank
[18:56] account actually they said you had you
[18:58] Dollar in your bank account you don't
[19:01] you cannot take those
[19:02] dollars uh so it was really really uh uh
[19:09] complicated um so I I I think that if we
[19:14] have like a bad situations economical
[19:17] situation that is going to Open the Eyes
[19:21] of many many like regular people you
[19:23] know people that have a bar that have
[19:25] you know they don't understand Bitcoin
[19:27] yet and they don't care about Bitcoin
[19:30] because they are fine you know they
[19:31] receive the they earn money they are
[19:34] fine okay and when you have some uh
[19:38] governments or for some reason that they
[19:41] start having more uh restrictions on
[19:46] your
[19:47] money you are going to start thinking
[19:49] hey why this you know why this is
[19:52] happening is is there an option and then
[19:55] they are going to start uh you know
[19:57] thinking and Alternatives no so uh not
[20:04] all the people unfortunately not all the
[20:07] people are interested in learning about
[20:10] about Finance or economics things
[20:14] unfortunately and that is something that
[20:16] all of us that we are creating content
[20:19] we are trying to to learn ourself and
[20:22] also to teach and to explain why it's
[20:25] important Bitcoin uh why it's important
[20:29] to to have your own uh um you know uh
[20:34] custody of your funds and why it's
[20:37] important to to have privacy so uh I
[20:40] think it's it's a matter of time uh I
[20:44] think when
[20:48] something I I I I'm not trying to think
[20:50] to think like something like a big
[20:53] episode or catastrophic episode happened
[20:57] but when you know like like that's um
[21:01] analogy with the frog with the co the
[21:04] water that is getting cold and then it
[21:08] suddenly is dies and if if it jump to
[21:11] the hot water you know just realize that
[21:14] don't need to be there so when something
[21:19] um really uh start
[21:22] to uh decentivize people to use the
[21:27] current system then they will find
[21:30] Bitcoin it's really interesting with the
[21:31] Frog and uh it's interesting I I looked
[21:35] that thing up once uh if if it's
[21:37] actually true with the Frog if it
[21:38] actually stays in the water it turns out
[21:42] it's it's actually the Frog will jump
[21:45] out at some point like there was like a
[21:47] research group that actually tried that
[21:49] for some reason uh so that's also my
[21:52] hope that's also my hope that the people
[21:55] uh don't burn in fear but at some point
[21:58] just jump out and it's interesting when
[22:00] we think of like oh people now fleeing
[22:02] to the US dollar even in Argentina and
[22:05] other countries they flee there because
[22:08] they don't have a a choice somewhere
[22:10] else and US dollar seems to be the next
[22:12] logical thing but what if the US dollar
[22:16] is like the pce of the day what if the
[22:18] US dollar and the US dollar is still the
[22:20] best one but it has already this like
[22:22] 100% 150% of
[22:25] inflation then it's interesting where
[22:28] where will be people go will they go to
[22:30] uh buy gold will they go to buy s some
[22:33] meme coin some shitcoin uh I don't know
[22:37] I I don't think so I think they they
[22:38] will go to bitcoin because at that point
[22:40] Bitcoin is probably already very big and
[22:43] is probably way Stabler than any other
[22:47] fiat currency uh and uh I think that
[22:51] could be that frog moment of the frog
[22:54] jumping out of that hot water and
[22:56] hopefully people uh go to to the Bitcoin
[23:00] so I I like the the analogy with with
[23:02] the pain that you made like the pain uh
[23:05] is is not high enough for people when
[23:07] the pain get gets higher then people uh
[23:10] jump out but it's hard to say when when
[23:13] the pain will be that that B that big
[23:15] and yeah if what Bitcoin also then does
[23:20] to to the field currency because people
[23:22] a lot of people argue that Bitcoin
[23:23] actually will make uh the Fe currency
[23:26] medium term better uh
[23:29] they all of the sudden have serious
[23:31] competition with with Bitcoin and people
[23:33] have actually have an exit wealth with
[23:35] Bitcoin so that's that's interesting to
[23:37] to witness and I think the next 10 years
[23:39] will be funny let let me tell you one
[23:42] one story that for me was very
[23:44] surprising I I'm giv some um you know
[23:47] inperson courses and I had two people in
[23:52] the last course and those are from the
[23:56] real estate industry
[23:58] they have a you know a real estate
[24:01] company a small company but they buy and
[24:04] sell help buyers and sellers you know
[24:07] and I asked them why are you learning
[24:10] about Bitcoin and they said because uh
[24:13] there are some customers that want to
[24:16] sell their homes and buy Bitcoin so they
[24:18] want to know how to do that how how to
[24:21] manage that uh they want to know what is
[24:24] transaction how does it work so we are
[24:27] seeing some
[24:28] all uh you know um fact that this is
[24:36] slowly changing and there are some
[24:39] people realizing that um yeah some
[24:43] something different needs to be done
[24:44] absolutely and it's interesting um the
[24:46] comparison of like getting to real
[24:49] estate all of the sudden uh from Real
[24:51] Estate all of the sudden to bitcoin I
[24:53] had like I don't know probably like 20
[24:54] guests already on that came from Real
[24:56] Estate and actually then got to bitcoin
[24:59] because they were like oh Bitcoin is
[25:01] actually like real estate without the
[25:04] [Laughter]
[25:07] headache you yeah you you will have one
[25:10] headache every four years but then you
[25:11] will have many happy bad times lower you
[25:15] you know uh so yeah uh yeah definitely
[25:20] definitely we are seeing that that Trend
[25:23] and um yeah I I think it's slowly and
[25:27] then sudden these things are going to
[25:29] happen uh we we we I remember in 2013
[25:33] 2014 many people said oh no you know
[25:36] this is gonna we we're going to have a
[25:38] government buying Bitcoin our companies
[25:40] buying Bitcoin you know I was like I
[25:42] didn't understood at that time uh I
[25:45] didn't understand at that time so it was
[25:48] really uh I was amazed of those guys
[25:52] that at that time they they were just
[25:54] saying you know this is going to be huge
[25:57] and I was I wasn't 100% sure to be
[26:00] honest and but then you know learning
[26:02] more asking people going to conference
[26:04] all over the world and and yeah that
[26:08] that's I think it's it's been a very
[26:11] very interesting journey and and one of
[26:13] the things that I I wanted to to I don't
[26:17] know this happened to you but one of the
[26:19] most or I would say the most uh
[26:23] interesting things of this is the
[26:25] quality of people that you meet in all
[26:28] events uh and the the stories uh and why
[26:32] they are in Bitcoin and it's very
[26:34] interesting and and I I I've been having
[26:37] and I met many people all over the world
[26:39] very interesting people and always open
[26:43] to do business or have a conversation so
[26:46] I think the community the bitcoiners
[26:48] community I think is also one of the
[26:50] biggest strength of this
[26:53] technology and 100% the the the
[26:56] community is amazing I love it so much
[26:59] it's you meet really great people in
[27:02] there and one thing that I also want to
[27:04] touch on because I think that's that
[27:06] that's especially for new people that
[27:09] come now and this seen a really
[27:11] interesting Insight you said before when
[27:14] Bitcoin was at $300 us that you felt
[27:17] Bitcoin is
[27:19] expensive which from now from the
[27:21] perspective from now feels like that's
[27:24] ridiculous like $300 is like so cheap in
[27:27] Bitcoin terms um but it seems to be like
[27:31] everyone always feels that Bitcoin is
[27:34] expensive whenever they they join even
[27:36] it was like at $1 $2 they like those
[27:38] tweets are like oh Bo Bitcoin is already
[27:40] at like uh the US dollar level at $1
[27:43] like it it's it's always feels like
[27:46] expensive like first of all like why do
[27:48] you think that is and and why do you
[27:49] think that's that's not true
[27:53] yeah uh you know there's a say there in
[27:56] the community you deserve your the
[27:58] Bitcoin that you know the price of the
[28:00] Bitcoin that you deserve you know um so
[28:04] there are there are so many ways to
[28:05] think Bitcoin when you think it from the
[28:10] conver conversion of energy
[28:12] into something to Value uh so it's so
[28:19] profound uh and it's so big that we
[28:22] still don't realize that I remember uh
[28:27] to those same guys those
[28:30] friends uh I think it was in 2020 I uh
[28:35] and and the Bitcoin was uh around 10,000
[28:40] and I said you know but I think it's a
[28:43] great opportunity here because probably
[28:46] your sons are going to ask you why you
[28:49] didn't bought you didn't buy Bitcoin
[28:52] when it was
[28:54] 10,000 and uh and yeah and and they they
[28:58] didn't buy yet and you know it's 68
[29:02] today uh
[29:04] so um I
[29:07] think I I'm not the guy that I talk
[29:10] about pricing on my my channel because I
[29:12] I don't do an an price analysis I think
[29:16] is is obvious that this going to be go
[29:18] up
[29:20] um you know uh so and I don't I don't do
[29:25] that I I just teach people how to use
[29:28] use tools for using Bitcoin um so um
[29:33] yeah for me is right now Bitcoin is
[29:35] cheap
[29:37] also uh depends on your mindset and that
[29:40] I think that that's definitely what what
[29:43] changed uh What uh what those big big uh
[29:49] funds are doing they are buying tons of
[29:52] Bitcoins thousands of Bitcoins because
[29:55] they changed their mindset they they
[29:58] they Chang the they change their view of
[30:01] the technology or on the potential of
[30:03] this so to be honest I don't know why
[30:07] people that don't want to buy Bitcoin
[30:09] think that they are more clever than
[30:12] those guys you know at that time and
[30:16] they are really focused on that they
[30:17] have people teams of people studying
[30:19] things and and new things and you know
[30:20] say wow uh yeah so yeah we will see if
[30:27] you watch my podcast already for more
[30:29] than two times you know how extremely
[30:32] passionate I am about self- custody and
[30:35] the first very very very important step
[30:38] to self cust is always getting yourself
[30:42] a hardware wallet and I have one for you
[30:45] here this is the Bitcoin only Edition
[30:47] from the bitbox my favorite single
[30:50] signature Hardware wallet on the market
[30:52] another really important piece of self-
[30:55] custody if you have a hardware wallet is
[30:58] the backup of the seat phrase and bitbox
[31:01] made the perfect solution to back up
[31:03] your seat phrase they made a reusable
[31:06] steel wallet check out that beauty it's
[31:09] durable and extremely heavy if I put it
[31:12] on the desk I seriously feel for my own
[31:16] table it's so so heavy and durable I
[31:19] love it this is where my seed phrase is
[31:22] secure go to bitbox
[31:25] do/ robobin to get your bitbox box and
[31:28] if you use code Robin you even get 5%
[31:32] off of your complete order and the next
[31:35] step is to really level up your
[31:37] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[31:40] have the most secure self- custody setup
[31:43] you have to secure your own devices you
[31:46] have to protect your privacy you have to
[31:48] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[31:51] on where you live you even want to have
[31:54] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[31:56] move in case some something goes really
[31:58] really wrong and through all those steps
[32:00] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[32:03] step by step and if you visit the
[32:06] Bitcoin way.com
[32:08] Partners robobin you even get a 30
[32:10] minute free call to find out how you can
[32:13] level up your sovereignty and last but
[32:16] not least I have something completely
[32:18] new for you guys I partnered up with
[32:22] coin vigilante this is the most
[32:24] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[32:27] saw created by anyone look at that
[32:30] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[32:33] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[32:36] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[32:39] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[32:42] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[32:45] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[32:48] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[32:52] watch collections you have the date of
[32:54] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[32:57] the there and of course also the block
[32:59] height and which EPO we are currently in
[33:03] I love the level of detail they put in
[33:06] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[33:08] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[33:11] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[33:14] love those watches so so much absolutely
[33:17] that's that's an interesting thing like
[33:19] the the people always come into Bitcoin
[33:22] and they they think they can fix it they
[33:23] can think that oh it's not not that and
[33:26] they always think like oh yeah I
[33:28] discovered what's wrong with Bitcoin all
[33:29] the people before never discovered that
[33:32] they they are not as smart as me so
[33:34] that's that's a thing that most people
[33:37] when when they come into this thing um
[33:40] Al really interesting I think you uh in
[33:43] one video I I saw that I let transcript
[33:46] from from jvd because I don't understand
[33:48] Spanish I think you talked also about
[33:50] human rights and how Bitcoin is is a is
[33:52] a is a tool for that is that is that
[33:54] right or was there a translation error
[33:56] uh I I think I think I I talk about it
[33:59] yeah I I I honestly think that is yeah
[34:03] it's it's a good tool again Bitcoin is a
[34:07] tool uh to so I I think it's a tool that
[34:12] can be used for as a human right yes uh
[34:16] I don't remember where I said that to be
[34:18] honest on the video uh but definitely is
[34:22] is something that um
[34:25] allows a marginal
[34:28] people to live and we are seeing this in
[34:33] Venezuela Venezuela is a worst case or
[34:37] at least I don't know about uh turkey
[34:40] because I don't have connection but in
[34:43] Venezuela I know many many people that
[34:46] because of they live
[34:49] Venezuela and also I know stories about
[34:52] people living in Venezuela with Bitcoin
[34:54] and you know working receiving Bitcoin
[34:57] and paying stuff in Venezuela and they
[34:59] leave like rich people because that
[35:03] solve a
[35:05] problem um so yeah the Bitcoin solves so
[35:11] many problems that um yeah that that you
[35:16] can you can see it from many
[35:18] different aspects because um yeah you
[35:22] you can solve the problem of restriction
[35:24] to access to your money you can solve
[35:26] the problem of uh inflation o over time
[35:30] you can solve a problem to send money
[35:32] from one place to another so yeah you
[35:36] you you solve many many many problems
[35:38] that unfortunately we as uh as humans we
[35:43] already have I I I was reading to the
[35:45] human right foundation website the other
[35:48] day and they said that 50% of the of the
[35:52] population it's under
[35:54] authoritarian uh government right
[35:58] uh probably because of China or Russia
[36:01] you know population they are big I I I'm
[36:04] not sure about those statistics but it's
[36:06] a huge number I mean it's not 10% it's
[36:09] not 20 it's 50 uh so definitely the uh
[36:15] Bitcoin is a solution for for many of
[36:17] them and we probably we are seeing other
[36:20] use cases that we don't already don't
[36:22] know what is happening what what do you
[36:25] think is the the role that that bitco in
[36:27] place in that that sovereignty uh
[36:30] mindset and do you also have like um
[36:34] other things that you say like we if you
[36:37] have Bitcoin that's great for your uh
[36:39] for your money uh sovereignty but you
[36:42] also need like some other tools uh that
[36:44] that you uh kind of discovered oh yes
[36:49] that that's been a journey for me also
[36:52] because when you realized about privacy
[36:56] stuff um uh
[36:58] and yeah on security so your your rabbit
[37:03] hole is bigger bigger and many many uh
[37:07] so yeah I think I what what what I first
[37:11] of all uh you you know we we need to
[37:16] start with a very very essential things
[37:19] and many many people don't use this very
[37:23] very essential tools like a ER password
[37:28] admin or or password
[37:31] generator uh software for example you
[37:35] know
[37:37] um how this password is yeah
[37:42] um for example I use bitwarden oh yeah
[37:46] password manager password manager yeah
[37:49] so that is so essential for not only
[37:54] Bitcoin I mean Bitcoin is just a small
[37:55] part obviously you not going to put your
[37:58] seat on on a password manager but this
[38:03] digital
[38:04] uh environment that we are moving every
[38:08] day more and more and more you need some
[38:11] very basic things and you don't even
[38:13] have a password manager you know so I I
[38:17] think the the to be to have a a higher
[38:20] level of sovereignty and privacy you
[38:23] need to start doing layers and layers
[38:25] and layers of of things and and yeah
[38:29] what I what I suggest to people is to go
[38:32] to a password uh manager today don't
[38:35] waste more time at the beginning I was
[38:38] re I I didn't want it to change but then
[38:41] it was before and after for me and then
[38:44] um yeah start using TFA double Factor
[38:50] authentication to everywhere as much as
[38:52] you can without SMS just the uh you know
[38:56] authentication uh
[38:58] tools
[38:59] um and then in terms of the mobile
[39:03] phones I'm an Apple user uh so far but
[39:08] I've
[39:09] been you know I I need to make my time
[39:12] to migrate to some other stuff like uh
[39:16] graphen
[39:17] OS uh I don't know if you heard about it
[39:21] yes so I I think that's much better
[39:23] solution uh in terms of privacy so that
[39:27] is something that I I I have the phone
[39:29] here actually I have it here uh I have a
[39:32] pixel but uh I didn't I have it for a
[39:36] few months I I didn't have a time to do
[39:38] the tutorials but definitely uh you know
[39:42] that is something that I I I wanted to
[39:44] do it's not Bitcoin related but it's
[39:46] more privacy and self sovereignty uh
[39:50] tools and yeah so I I I think they are
[39:55] go hand in hand both topics and at the
[39:59] end what you want is to have a a human
[40:01] that is going to be able to do whatever
[40:04] he wants and without any limitation
[40:07] especially from
[40:09] governments yeah it's it's it's
[40:11] interesting how important like um I
[40:14] think most people are very convenient
[40:16] with their digital lifestyle and they
[40:20] use whatever like their OS is sorry
[40:26] their OS is suggest testing them so they
[40:28] use the password managers that Apple and
[40:30] Google provides for them uh they use two
[40:34] Factor on defination only if they are
[40:36] like asked to do that and and those
[40:40] basic things why do you why is that so
[40:43] important for someone to do uh the basic
[40:46] security to do the basic privacy uh and
[40:50] and why could it be very critical in the
[40:52] future so
[40:54] essentially uh because of History uh
[40:57] history tell us uh that those databases
[41:00] are stolen are being hacked and
[41:05] essentially uh for a hacker to access to
[41:09] that information to the password to an
[41:11] email is going to be easy it's
[41:15] relatively easy and it's going to be
[41:17] easier over time and and and for the
[41:19] hackers uh it's very very very
[41:22] easy uh to say okay if this user have
[41:26] this email in for this
[41:29] Bank probably what happen if we create a
[41:33] bot and instead of checking if this
[41:36] email and password goes to this Bank
[41:40] what happen if we try this in thousands
[41:42] of banks if we try this same combination
[41:46] into thousand of of social networks
[41:49] accounts what if we do this with
[41:51] thousands of exchanges all over the
[41:54] world and it's very easy to do it uh so
[41:57] so you program something and you take a
[41:59] database from thousands and millions
[42:01] probably of combination of password and
[42:03] emails and you just do that so that is
[42:07] very easy and if you repeat your
[42:10] password all over every time uh I think
[42:14] that is I used to do that in the past
[42:16] and and I just realized that that's the
[42:18] worst the worst uh um situation and
[42:24] because that that is really uh really
[42:28] easy and uh you know I have a family
[42:31] group and and some people say you know
[42:35] uh I created one uh one B One account
[42:40] here and you know I always remember the
[42:42] M the the password because the same that
[42:44] I use everywhere you know and it's a
[42:47] problem because I I I wrote it down in a
[42:50] note in a pencil in a pen and you know
[42:54] if I lose this h this book uh little
[42:59] book I you know you lose access to
[43:02] everything um and I and I actually sent
[43:04] them hey you know I did a tutorial about
[43:06] it so I just send it to my my own family
[43:10] you know and and then I said oh well
[43:13] well thank you thank you and I bet you
[43:15] that nobody did it yet because I didn't
[43:19] receive any question so for sure they
[43:22] didn't do it and they have the
[43:24] information and it's very very easy and
[43:26] it's free you don't have to pay for
[43:28] anything it's your time only so again uh
[43:34] it's about changing how the minds of the
[43:36] human work and and how they are they
[43:39] they just want to say oh you know
[43:40] nothing happened to me so far so you
[43:43] know everything is good as sometimes
[43:45] happen to me with other stuff but uh we
[43:48] need to fight those kind of uh tricks of
[43:52] our mind that you know wanted to autoc
[43:55] convince that everything is okay when
[43:57] definitely is not that's really
[43:58] interesting we we kind of have to like
[44:01] really get down the rabbit hole and say
[44:02] like oh my security my uh safety is
[44:06] really important uh and we have to do
[44:09] something for that I think that's that's
[44:10] really important to do um for for the
[44:14] for the podcast um we we have one more
[44:17] topic that I really want to to get into
[44:19] the the adoption curve of of Bitcoin
[44:21] moving forward we we did it already a
[44:23] little bit before um we talked about uh
[44:27] the what what adoption barriers could
[44:29] could be in in Bitcoin how how you see
[44:32] the future of it um one interesting
[44:35] question that I was thinking of like
[44:38] when you could design a world where like
[44:41] like you you could from scratch to
[44:44] society you can uh design something that
[44:46] is uh completely new around Bitcoin and
[44:50] maybe then we can also go into like oh
[44:52] how how can maybe in the future a
[44:54] Bitcoin world uh look like or like where
[44:57] more open source and more decentralized
[45:00] networks maybe even with Nostra can
[45:02] interact how do you envision that kind
[45:05] of future how do you see uh a world
[45:09] where Bitcoin already succeeded no
[45:11] matter like when this is probably some
[45:14] some years out uh and where like open
[45:17] source and privacy and security is like
[45:20] really on the Forefront of everyone's
[45:22] mind how how do you envision that uh
[45:26] that is very deep and and interesting
[45:29] question I never I never think about it
[45:33] um what I did is I participated in few
[45:37] some conversations of people that wanted
[45:39] to create like a community small
[45:42] community with bitcoiners that shares
[45:44] the same values so if I wanted to create
[45:48] that those kind of stuff uh I think uh
[45:53] there are kind of uh two topics to to to
[45:59] talk and and to set at the beginning one
[46:03] is going to be the values that you want
[46:05] to share within that community and that
[46:08] population I think that's uh that's the
[46:12] the the basic thing uh that allows a
[46:16] population to to have some stability and
[46:20] some common sense or some framework and
[46:23] the other thing is uh incentives
[46:27] how the incentives are going to work
[46:29] because you need to have incentives for
[46:32] people to invest in that
[46:34] community and and you need to have
[46:37] incentives
[46:38] for uh being governed in XY in in a way
[46:44] that everybody uh or not everybody or
[46:47] that makes sense for everybody and Bas
[46:51] essentially learn from other
[46:53] experiences um I remember when I I used
[46:56] to work at consensus you know consensus
[46:59] I that was my ER era in in ethereum
[47:04] ecosystem uh so I I used to work there I
[47:08] worked for a year uh developing the
[47:11] business in Mexico and Colombia and
[47:13] Central America and at that time I
[47:17] remember you know everybody let's do
[47:19] very decentralized company and let's do
[47:22] everything you know on your own with
[47:24] your team Etc and it was like ideal
[47:28] ideal dream or of the company and
[47:31] then uh I remember that that there was
[47:36] there there is a book I don't remember
[47:38] the name but there is a book that talks
[47:40] about decentralized uh
[47:43] organizations uh it was written by a
[47:45] French author author I don't remember
[47:48] the the name but I so I bad with the
[47:51] names but I remember that we were about
[47:54] to have a a call
[47:57] with this guy with the author of this
[48:00] guy and I I read the book and I learned
[48:04] of the of the experience of groups small
[48:08] groups or it was like AO organized and
[48:12] they achieved a lot of very very very
[48:15] very high standard things and it was
[48:17] very very
[48:18] interesting and we were about to have
[48:21] the the the call with this guy you know
[48:23] the week after uh you know one week late
[48:28] after that time uh and I confus yeah I
[48:31] want to participate and let's say that
[48:34] that that was in Monday or Tuesday and
[48:36] that weekend we had
[48:38] a um we had
[48:41] a an an event in
[48:46] Chile and I remember that we went to
[48:49] that event that was on Friday we set the
[48:53] the stage you know the we had our booth
[48:56] with everything thing you know and it
[48:58] was we were there talking with people
[49:00] projects Etc and then uh at the end of
[49:03] that day they told us okay tomorrow 9:00
[49:06] am we have a meeting I was like okay
[49:09] let's have a meeting we have a meeting
[49:11] essentially we were all fire from the
[49:14] company uh just like that and we had the
[49:18] booth there you know with the company
[49:20] and you know we said okay we are not
[49:22] part of this company and because they
[49:25] they just let people go from many many
[49:27] places all over the world the company
[49:29] was really big price of Bitcoin went of
[49:33] crypto in general went down and so they
[49:36] reduced stuff they did a huge reduction
[49:39] of stuff all over the world and
[49:41] unfortunately they couldn't go to that
[49:44] meeting with this guy of the the
[49:47] centralized organization because of this
[49:49] I I'm not sure that that meeting was
[49:52] done but um that was a huge um you know
[49:57] learning process because if if you want
[50:00] to have the ideal the ideal um Society
[50:04] idea
[50:06] Community it's not easy um but I think
[50:11] if you have like the those values that
[50:14] you share and you have the incentives
[50:18] correctly
[50:19] aligned um I think that that there are
[50:23] higher chances that you can make a
[50:25] community more uh
[50:28] free and and yeah and
[50:32] and with a higher level of of um you
[50:37] know happiness or fulfillment of the
[50:39] individual that lives there in that
[50:42] Community was that book uh Reinventing
[50:45] organization that you yeah like jbd is
[50:50] amazing there you go there you go I
[50:53] basically just like uh a book about
[50:56] decentralized organization by French
[50:59] offer and it's like Ah that's
[51:01] it thanks J
[51:04] gbd but yeah it's an interesting Insight
[51:07] uh I think uh the the future will be
[51:10] quite interesting I I love to um think
[51:14] about the the future generations and how
[51:16] how we will uh deal with stuff when
[51:19] Bitcoin and all those open source uh
[51:22] things actually succeed and we can move
[51:25] on from from the world that we live
[51:28] today to a completely new world but it
[51:31] will be a long transitioning time and
[51:32] let's see if I can even live in that
[51:35] time if I live that long really yeah
[51:38] yeah what I've learned is that we we we
[51:41] all imagine those situations or those
[51:45] Community ideal communities I think that
[51:48] is something that it been in the human
[51:51] brain throughout history uh and the the
[51:56] thing there is going to be that okay
[51:59] let's say that you create your ideal
[52:01] Community but definitely that ideal
[52:03] Community is going to be connected in
[52:05] some way with the rest of the world
[52:09] so yeah how do you do that and you you
[52:12] can see you can see those examples of
[52:15] those community of you know um I forgot
[52:20] the name of those small community
[52:23] religious communities that for example
[52:25] move from Europe to to Latin America and
[52:28] they have they work on on the land and
[52:32] they have their own thing and they are
[52:35] happy with that and and over time they
[52:37] are they learn that need to be open with
[52:40] the society to learn to to sell the
[52:43] their products everything but they they
[52:46] keep their those values and they keep
[52:49] the incentives align at some point so I
[52:53] think it's very interesting to to to
[52:56] learn from them and they are really
[52:58] successful in for example in Mexico they
[53:02] they started they they they told them
[53:04] hey you know get this land for free and
[53:07] it was very added added land over years
[53:11] decades one is one of the biggest land
[53:15] fertile land in in in Mexico because
[53:19] they work every day and you know and
[53:21] they they just wanted to have one
[53:23] objective and they uh and now they it's
[53:26] very very uh um very big uh you know
[53:31] business for them do you think uh on on
[53:34] that note of future civilizations is
[53:37] Bitcoin ready to be multiplanetary is
[53:39] Bitcoin ready to be uh a currency that's
[53:42] not only on Earth
[53:44] successful so I think it's going to be a
[53:47] matter of communication how do you
[53:49] communicate the
[53:51] blockchain you know how do you
[53:54] communicate between planetaries
[53:56] at some point uh maybe you can do uh
[54:00] like side chains in each planet planet
[54:03] planet uh I don't know and they
[54:05] communicat because you have the light
[54:08] the the Restriction there is going to be
[54:09] the light speed
[54:12] uh um so I guess I'm not a scientific
[54:17] but I think that that eventually is
[54:19] going to be a it
[54:22] uh in many years from now absolutely
[54:25] really cool I I just wanted to throw
[54:27] that in because we we talked about the
[54:30] future and it's it's it's a question I
[54:32] think that's really interesting to think
[54:33] about but not something that concerns us
[54:36] uh in in the near future a lot of people
[54:39] are outside of the earth uh really cool
[54:42] um before we go to the end routine I
[54:45] always have one question that is always
[54:46] the same for every guest what can we
[54:48] learn from you besides all the things
[54:50] that we already talked
[54:52] about well uh related to bitcoin or to
[54:56] other stuff whatever you want like uh
[54:59] outside of Bitcoin is is perfect oh okay
[55:02] okay yeah well so related to bitcoin
[55:06] um what you can learn from me I I mean
[55:10] if you
[55:11] have I I drop Mo most of
[55:15] my uh knowledge on naturally or it's a
[55:19] studying process into the YouTube
[55:22] channel with the many many hundreds of
[55:25] videos
[55:27] um and we learn how to use tools uh and
[55:32] tips for using Bitcoin in Spanish uh but
[55:36] naturally that is going to over over the
[55:40] next few month or years you know that is
[55:42] not going to be a restriction because
[55:44] you know it's everything is going to be
[55:46] translated into whatever language that
[55:49] you want to listen to it and So
[55:51] eventually the language is not going to
[55:54] be a barrier um um so if you want to
[55:57] have like high quality videos tutorial
[56:00] videos that would be an option some some
[56:02] people tell that uh I'm the BET sessions
[56:06] or in Spanish with asteroid I I heard
[56:10] about but I I don't consume asteroid uh
[56:14] and and I think Ben from BET session is
[56:16] doing a great job in English is he's
[56:19] great um so uh that that's regarding uh
[56:24] Bitcoin and well I my one of my other my
[56:29] passions outside Bitcoin is sailing so I
[56:32] love sailing so I I I can teach people
[56:36] to to sail and and yeah and do stuff on
[56:40] the water sailing is really uh it's
[56:44] interesting but not more with mot to
[56:46] like just with the wind right
[56:48] sailing sorry with with with the with
[56:51] the wind and not with the um motor yeah
[56:56] exactly yeah with the with the with the
[56:58] wind yes and that actually I didn't
[57:01] realize but that actually is an an
[57:04] expression of freedom because uh that
[57:10] you know 500 or many more years ago it
[57:14] was a technology that people used to to
[57:19] have freedom or it's escape from from
[57:21] stuff you know and I think Michael saor
[57:25] has has boat on the on the back on its
[57:28] office and he talks about that that was
[57:31] a
[57:32] technology uh so yeah um that's very
[57:37] interesting analogy uh and
[57:41] yeah having a boat in the backyard to to
[57:44] to drive away all the time that's that's
[57:47] a that's a good way to secure yourself
[57:49] yeah travel yeah you know you know you
[57:52] you you go sailing and then you lost all
[57:55] your Bitcoin because they fall to the
[57:58] [Laughter]
[57:59] sea but the this is the one thing I mean
[58:04] it it's kind of because that's the one
[58:07] argument I would not use like if I want
[58:09] to be a criminal if I want to say like
[58:11] Oh My My I don't have access to my
[58:13] Bitcoin anymore I think a really bad
[58:15] thing to say is like oh I lost them in
[58:18] in the C because then they cannot move
[58:20] anymore and if they actually move again
[58:22] then they're like oh why did they move
[58:24] again uh so then they have questions
[58:26] around that but uh yeah maybe a better
[58:29] thing is to say is like oh yeah they got
[58:32] hacked or something like that that's by
[58:34] way all the time when I see some some
[58:37] public story on bitcoin my Bitcoin got
[58:39] hacked and I'm like maybe he just like
[58:42] needs public ping for the story yeah you
[58:46] never know about it and and you know
[58:48] that that that is a huge thing for
[58:52] inheritance you know inheritance is a
[58:55] huge
[58:56] topic and I've been learning about it I
[58:59] recently published the video about you
[59:02] know three options and there are so many
[59:04] other uh things to
[59:07] consider and yeah so that's another
[59:11] thing for another
[59:14] topic we're already at at one hour but I
[59:17] think I think I saw that video you
[59:19] talked about cars Unchained and and
[59:22] third one right nuk yeah ANUK yeah yeah
[59:26] really Co I think they they're great
[59:27] options if you want to have
[59:29] collaborative multi uh and with
[59:31] collaborative multi uh then inheritance
[59:34] also gets easier I think that's a it's a
[59:37] great option to to consider if you if
[59:38] you want to do that
[59:41] yeah really cool perfect then thank you
[59:43] so much uh we have now our end routine
[59:45] where the previous guest is asking a
[59:46] question for the next guest without
[59:48] knowing who the next guest actually is
[59:50] um the question for you from the
[59:51] previous guest is what needs to happen
[59:54] that you change your mind on bitcoin and
[59:57] you sell it all ah very interesting very
[60:01] interesting one so uh yeah the only
[60:05] reason why I I would change or sell
[60:09] Bitcoin is because the
[60:11] energy is zero you know if the energy
[60:15] goes to zero okay I will say my Bitcoin
[60:18] the energy in the in
[60:20] the in the how do you say that in the
[60:24] existing
[60:26] uh space so that is going to
[60:29] be probably zero
[60:33] chances uh but essentially because of
[60:36] the energy if we have no energy we have
[60:38] no Bitcoin you you mean uh the the
[60:42] energy and electricity going off
[60:44] worldwide or nobody's mining anymore no
[60:47] no no no planets no no no stars bigger
[60:52] than
[60:53] that oh so like that oh yeah that's that
[60:58] that's
[60:59] fascinating
[61:01] yeah I I think then we have different
[61:03] problems
[61:06] right yeah you know interplanetary
[61:09] Bitcoin yeah uh so because essentially
[61:12] is energy so it's energy you can find
[61:16] not only in the world in our Earth you
[61:18] can find it in many stars if you want
[61:22] thousand millions of stars so we don't
[61:24] know the limits it's it's an indust
[61:26] question to think about yeah thank you
[61:27] so much joim for for being on the show
[61:30] where can people find you when they want
[61:31] to ask questions where can people uh
[61:33] watch this stuff yeah so you can you can
[61:37] search for bet in espanol and espanol
[61:41] and user in X Twitter bet in
[61:45] espanol and we are also in Tik Tok and
[61:48] in Instagram um but essentially if you
[61:51] want to have a conversation go to X or
[61:54] Twitter um
[61:56] and we can have a conversation there
[61:58] really cool thank you so much for being
[62:00] on also thank you so much for everyone
[62:01] that is watching and listening as always
[62:04] I'll be back uh tomorrow with another
[62:06] episode bye-bye bye
