[00:00] Bitcoin will bring peace to Earth I just
[00:02] see Bitcoin as the foundation layer for
[00:06] the monetary system to bring Integrity
[00:08] into that aspect of life we need sound
[00:11] money that is authentic and transparent
[00:14] and honest when we want to have a
[00:16] healthy economy we have Bitcoin when we
[00:18] want to have a healthy relationship we
[00:20] have nonviolent communication when I
[00:22] discovered Bitcoin and realized what it
[00:24] really was it was that moment of like oh
[00:27] my gosh this is truly lifechanging I
[00:31] think proof of work used to be common in
[00:33] our world everything only came by proof
[00:35] of work back in the day and now that we
[00:37] have the Disposable Society they're
[00:39] they're easy come easy go if I want to
[00:41] donate to a project or to something
[00:42] fantastic that I see happening in the
[00:44] world I can just do it with no middleman
[00:47] you know no intermediary no need to ask
[00:49] [Music]
[00:53] permission I just see Bitcoin as the
[00:57] foundation layer for the monetary system
[01:00] to bring Integrity into that aspect of
[01:03] life on Earth and then I see NBC as a
[01:06] foundational tech for a communication
[01:09] system to bring peace and Harmony
[01:12] amongst individuals and even amongst
[01:14] Nations as as a potential Way Forward
[01:17] for that for people don't know what is
[01:19] NVC I also heard it the first time ever
[01:22] when when when I researched about you
[01:24] and when you now right now told me about
[01:26] that okay yeah for sure um so NV C
[01:30] stands for nonviolent communication it's
[01:32] funny because we've got BTC for Bitcoin
[01:35] although I don't like saying that
[01:37] because that's like the mon you know the
[01:39] kind of the the asset class and I just
[01:42] think of it more as money but but yes so
[01:45] NVC um so there's a man named Marshall
[01:48] Rosenberg who grew up in Detroit in I
[01:51] guess the 50s and he experienced the
[01:54] race riots that happened there and then
[01:57] he himself so he was you know observed
[01:59] those he wasn't attacked himself but his
[02:01] family you know had to stay indoors
[02:03] during those few days that that was
[02:05] going on and then and he was a sort of a
[02:08] young boy at that point I guess I'm not
[02:10] sure like 10 or 11 or something and then
[02:13] later on in school he experienced a lot
[02:15] of um U attacks physical and verbal um
[02:20] because he was Jewish and he was not
[02:23] seen favorably by the other kids and so
[02:27] all of these things kind of really
[02:29] touched his heart as a kid and he just
[02:32] wanted to understand why people attack
[02:35] other people because they're different
[02:38] in some way and it led him on a long
[02:41] journey he ended up getting uh becoming
[02:44] a clinical psychologist thinking you
[02:46] know that would help him to sort of
[02:48] understand human nature and help people
[02:50] who are struggling he he sort of
[02:52] realized along the way that people that
[02:55] hurt people are hurt like hurt people
[02:57] hurt people right and I mean nowadays
[03:00] that seems sort of almost cliche and
[03:02] it's so obvious and we all know it but
[03:05] back then you know in the 50s and 60s
[03:07] that was still all being kind of
[03:10] unraveled and and sort of discovered and
[03:12] looked at and and thought about if for
[03:14] the first time really um or it was in
[03:17] the early days of all of that sort of
[03:19] exploration so he thought well if he
[03:22] could understand people and understand
[03:24] why they do the things they do and you
[03:27] know he could help them to heal and and
[03:29] there for they wouldn't hurt other
[03:31] people and and bring help bring sort of
[03:34] more peace to Earth which was really his
[03:37] underlying longing I suppose you could
[03:39] say and then through the work of being a
[03:43] clinical psychologist he kind of
[03:44] realized that labeling people doesn't
[03:47] necessarily help them and he just
[03:49] noticed some of the downfalls of that
[03:52] system and so at a certain point he he
[03:55] quit that that career you and he went
[03:59] and spoke to people I I believe all over
[04:02] the world uh or in many places I should
[04:04] say and he really looked for people who
[04:09] had been
[04:10] through very very dramatic
[04:13] trauma and had managed to stay connected
[04:17] to their heart connected to a sense of
[04:19] optimism and positivity as opposed to
[04:22] the people that he had observed either
[04:26] in his practice or in life that had been
[04:28] hurt and had had become very angry
[04:31] violent bitter and resentful as a result
[04:33] of it somehow like disconnected from
[04:35] their heart and their uh sense of
[04:38] optimism and hope and from Humanity in a
[04:41] sense and became more and more violent
[04:44] and he wanted to understand why those
[04:46] that stayed connected like how they
[04:49] could have like what was that sort of he
[04:52] wanted to see if there was a common
[04:53] denominator some sort of a magic touch
[04:57] that they' had or experienced or what it
[04:59] was that allowed them and and uh what he
[05:04] found was that just this is I suppose
[05:07] you could say empirical you know through
[05:09] talking through to many many
[05:11] individuals that the people who'd been
[05:13] through a lot of trauma and stayed
[05:15] connected had all had someone in their
[05:19] early Lives who had been able to hold a
[05:23] space of presence for them had just been
[05:25] able to be there and not judge them not
[05:29] try and fix them as such but like listen
[05:32] to them let them Express themselves and
[05:36] and just uh what he later developed was
[05:39] you know empathy like the way of being
[05:42] empathic to someone no matter what
[05:43] they're going through but without
[05:45] feeling like you've got to fix their
[05:47] pain or take their pain away but just
[05:49] allow them to experience whatever it is
[05:52] they're going through and be there for
[05:54] them and that that seemed to be that
[05:58] having had that experience
[06:00] had given people some like inner touch
[06:04] point I
[06:05] suppose um where they were able to stay
[06:08] connected and I'm just you know
[06:09] paraphrasing and of course you know um
[06:12] always do your own research and so on
[06:13] but like I've I've you know this is what
[06:16] I've learned and read and and I've and
[06:18] I've been in workshops and 10day
[06:20] Retreats and and things with with him
[06:22] when he was alive so we definitely heard
[06:25] a lot of stories and that was the
[06:27] General overview and so then what he
[06:30] continued to do then was just sort of
[06:32] develop this way of holding that sort of
[06:34] space of presence with people and I will
[06:36] say observing him do that was a very
[06:39] profound experience for me like he would
[06:42] invite people to come up um in the front
[06:44] of the room and sit with him and talk
[06:46] about anything that was you know going
[06:49] on for them and generally you know
[06:52] things that were difficult or
[06:53] devastating and he just had this way of
[06:57] being so absolutely present and
[07:01] connected it was it was profound to sort
[07:04] of observe and be in that space he just
[07:07] he didn't even say anything he was just
[07:09] there but it was so um it was deep I I I
[07:13] don't know how to really put it into
[07:14] words and the people often cried you
[07:17] know they
[07:18] often they made
[07:21] connections without him having to even
[07:23] say stuff they would
[07:25] just uh realize things and then
[07:29] occasionally you know he would he would
[07:31] act as the other party of uh like
[07:34] roleplay the person maybe that had hurt
[07:36] this person and he would say things from
[07:40] a more from a healed perspective right
[07:43] and yeah there was just very profound
[07:46] forgiveness connection understanding
[07:48] release relief and healing that happened
[07:51] in those spaces so yeah that was a big
[07:55] part of the process and then you know he
[07:57] actually developed a four-step process
[07:59] that is known as nonviolent
[08:01] communication but one has to always be
[08:03] careful not to get hung up on the four
[08:06] steps um I'll say what they are in a
[08:09] minute but it's just because they are
[08:11] like the formal version of nonviolent
[08:14] communication so you use them when
[08:18] you're struggling emotionally and all
[08:20] kind of messed up and just
[08:22] grasping and you come up for air and you
[08:25] can take yourself through the four steps
[08:27] but you don't want to sort of converse
[08:29] with other people in that formal way
[08:31] because it will sound weird and they'll
[08:33] think that you're just doing some psycho
[08:35] Babble but what it is is like you when
[08:38] you're struggling when someone's really
[08:40] upset you let's say or a situation or an
[08:43] event uh has happened and you feel very
[08:46] upset or angry or scared or frustrated
[08:48] about it um you can use these four steps
[08:52] so the first step would be you create
[08:55] you find the you look for the
[08:56] observation like what is it that you you
[08:59] saw or that you
[09:01] heard that that is the trigger for your
[09:06] your response or your reaction right so
[09:09] um you act like a video camera would
[09:12] what do you see or what do you hear
[09:14] without any opinions or judgments or
[09:17] labels or
[09:18] diagnosis and then once you've got that
[09:21] clear you ask yourself okay so how am I
[09:24] feeling and you name the feelings that
[09:26] you're
[09:27] experiencing and then you ask yourself
[09:30] what am I needing and so the needs are
[09:34] like the
[09:35] human values like our deepest needs
[09:38] there's a a list that we work with it's
[09:41] not definitive um but it is pretty well
[09:45] sort of agreed upon at this point by
[09:47] thousands of people who've been through
[09:48] the process and I've taught many many
[09:50] workshops and I always hand out the
[09:52] needs list and say can any of you say
[09:55] something on this list that you've never
[09:58] ever wanted or could never imagine
[10:00] wanting and I've literally never had
[10:04] anybody you know come up with anything
[10:06] so so we sort of agree that this is a
[10:09] universal list and I mean it includes
[10:11] things like everything you need for
[10:13] physical survival uh for physical
[10:15] well-being you know Comfort ease Choice
[10:20] autonomy you know under autonomy you
[10:22] would have choice you would have freedom
[10:24] Independence you we have a need for
[10:26] integrity authenticity honesty we have
[10:29] have a need for meaning you know
[10:30] challenge competence creativity
[10:33] Discovery we have needs for openness for
[10:36] reassurance for respect for um you know
[10:40] stability to hear and to be heard to be
[10:44] seen to understand we have needs for
[10:48] cooperation so all of these things are
[10:50] just very basic sort of human you can
[10:53] call them desires values needs and once
[10:56] you establish what needs were not met by
[11:00] what that other person or situation did
[11:02] or said then you can move on to making a
[11:05] request and that's the fourth step and
[11:08] the request is something that you can
[11:10] ask of
[11:12] yourself to do to meet your needs or you
[11:15] can ask it of the other person that's
[11:17] directly involved or sometimes you you
[11:20] might want to rather ask someone who's
[11:22] not involved to help you meet whatever
[11:24] need it is or needs so those are the
[11:27] four steps and you know they can get
[11:29] used in in different ways and yeah so I
[11:33] guess that was a long-winded but sort of
[11:36] an overview of what nonviolent
[11:37] communication is and then you know it's
[11:40] Chang it changed my life my husband's
[11:42] life our children you know raising them
[11:45] with this Consciousness was very very
[11:48] life-changing for us and has allowed us
[11:51] to have incredible
[11:53] relationships um yeah so I think I'll
[11:56] stop there because I know I've been
[11:57] going
[11:58] on well I I hope that gives you you know
[12:01] an overview and I'm of course happy to
[12:03] hear any questions or or clarifications
[12:05] or anything that you require I think
[12:07] it's a it's a really great method I
[12:10] never heard about it so I think I I will
[12:13] I will go down a a deeper rabbit all day
[12:16] later on um uh but it's it's it's
[12:19] something really interesting to think
[12:21] about having a process like obviously if
[12:23] you're any human being that is on Earth
[12:27] for any period of time probably
[12:29] encountered difficulties in your life
[12:31] you probably encountered anger or
[12:33] sadness whatever it is if someone else
[12:37] in your life uh and you developed some
[12:40] some things hopefully uh to cope with
[12:43] that and hopefully the deal you cope
[12:45] with that is something healthy for you
[12:47] I'm not destructive I think a lot of
[12:49] people have destructive behaviors if
[12:51] they in Anger sadness um and I
[12:56] definitely worked a lot on that topic
[12:58] with my girlfriend and being as uh
[13:02] constructive and good as possible in in
[13:04] in difficult times it's easy to be
[13:07] together if everything is fine but like
[13:09] the the hard times Define a character
[13:12] the most I feel like how strong it is
[13:15] and stuff like that the question I now
[13:18] have as we're on a Bitcoin podcast
[13:22] how how
[13:24] correlated uh is that sound
[13:27] communication that nonviolent
[13:30] communication with sound money with
[13:32] Bitcoin what's the connection what's the
[13:35] correlation there you see do and maybe I
[13:39] ask that later but just to note it here
[13:41] um would sound money also encourage more
[13:46] and better communication that's kind of
[13:48] where I I go with that question I love
[13:52] that question okay so I guess we can we
[13:54] can go to that one afterwards though
[13:56] like you said um and and I guess just to
[13:59] just to clarify uh for the listeners
[14:02] that that there will be an article
[14:03] coming out I don't know if you recorded
[14:05] that part at the beginning so I just
[14:07] will say you know the this log five of
[14:09] Stack chain magazine that's about to be
[14:11] shipped out there's going to be an
[14:13] article in there on this whole topic and
[14:16] then there'll be an expanded version of
[14:17] that article on my website as well um
[14:22] yeah so so the way so you know when I
[14:25] discovered uh noral and communication oh
[14:28] God
[14:29] 20 years ago now little more I felt the
[14:34] same way as when I discovered Bitcoin
[14:37] and realized what it really was right of
[14:40] course like everybody I didn't realize
[14:42] right away but when I realized it was
[14:44] that moment of like oh my gosh this this
[14:48] is truly
[14:50] lifechanging and and this is a
[14:53] technology that and and I mean
[14:55] technology even with regards to
[14:56] nonviolent communication because Lang
[14:59] anguage is a
[15:00] technology um that if the world could be
[15:04] on the standard so to speak we would
[15:08] have far far far more
[15:11] peace on Earth than we do now amongst
[15:14] individuals communities families um
[15:17] towns you know
[15:18] Nations so I guess you know there's been
[15:22] a part of me since I was a kid who's
[15:23] always really really longed to find and
[15:27] engage in ways that bring more people
[15:29] peace to Earth it's just been a very
[15:31] profound longing for me and when I
[15:33] discovered nonviolent communication I
[15:35] had that sense and then when I
[15:37] discovered Bitcoin I had that sense from
[15:39] you know obviously a different angle but
[15:41] but that same like oh my God this is
[15:43] foundational the world needs this and
[15:47] and like when you said sound money you
[15:49] know to me there sound money and there
[15:51] sound communication money is transaction
[15:55] between individuals it's agreements
[15:57] between us it's um
[15:59] you know offering my value for your
[16:01] value and sound communication is also
[16:05] communication and it is transaction of
[16:08] words thoughts and feelings between
[16:10] individuals and it's um ah yeah I see
[16:14] what you just pulled up that's great
[16:16] yeah I just wanted to give it as a
[16:17] context for for those who also have uh
[16:20] the visual in front of them or people
[16:22] that now just listen to it uh you you
[16:25] can pull out your phone and and maybe
[16:26] look at it uh to to see some of of the
[16:29] things there I'm a visual guy so I
[16:32] always need the visuals to it and I can
[16:34] better feel it but I just wanted to did
[16:37] not uh intend to interrupt you sorry no
[16:39] problem no I'm GL I'm glad this is
[16:41] fantastic yeah and it's perfect I I'm
[16:43] reading through it it's all absolutely
[16:45] on point so so yeah with um sound
[16:48] communication that's a transaction you
[16:50] know every time we speak or say
[16:53] something or listen to someone we're
[16:54] transacting with our energy with our
[16:57] attention and I think think that just as
[17:00] we need sound money that is authentic
[17:03] and transparent and um honest we need
[17:07] the same in our communication if we want
[17:10] to have healthy relationships so you
[17:12] know when we want to have a healthy
[17:14] economy we have Bitcoin when we want to
[17:16] have a healthy relationship we have
[17:18] nonviolent communication or some other
[17:21] form I mean there are others um I will
[17:24] say that when we found this it was
[17:26] because we were very much needing my
[17:29] husband and I were both um had you know
[17:33] spiritual sort of awarenesses I'll just
[17:36] leave it at that of how of of H of
[17:41] connection to higher power and we wanted
[17:44] to live that truth and that beauty with
[17:48] our children and then for anybody who's
[17:51] that children you realize like oh my
[17:53] this is a whole different ball game how
[17:56] do I do this how do I live the
[17:59] compassion and the love and the peace
[18:02] that I I want to live with my children
[18:05] when they're you know acting out or not
[18:07] doing what I want or just being their
[18:10] wonderful very extremely individualistic
[18:12] and individual
[18:14] selves and so that is what really drove
[18:16] us to look for something um and we did
[18:20] find other methods that I will say are
[18:22] great but they just didn't work for us
[18:25] and our family the way this did so I
[18:27] just want to say that because I'm not
[18:28] saying nonviolent communication is the
[18:30] only way whereas I do think at this
[18:33] point that Bitcoin is the only way
[18:36] personally um yeah
[18:41] so so yeah I think the crossover is is
[18:44] that that you know it's a foundational
[18:46] technology for humans to to uh interact
[18:50] with with regards to their communication
[18:53] and then like I said before there's
[18:55] which I'm not sure if you're recording
[18:56] there's a lot of different Sim arities
[18:59] like they're both born out of pain right
[19:01] you know Satoshi as far as we know he
[19:03] kind of told us what uh he was why he
[19:08] was creating Bitcoin in the first first
[19:10] paragraph of the white paper and also in
[19:12] the writing in the Genesis block and you
[19:15] know so it was clearly like out of this
[19:19] frustration with the financial system
[19:22] and Marshall created non-violent
[19:23] communication out of frustration with
[19:26] the communication system and article
[19:29] goes into some of the ways that we
[19:32] communicate and language that we use
[19:35] that leads to disconnection rather than
[19:38] connection like just an example is
[19:40] deserve the word deserve or deserve
[19:42] oriented
[19:44] thinking um when we think someone
[19:47] deserves punishment it actually makes it
[19:52] enjoyable to meet out that punishment
[19:55] because we think we're like doing this
[19:57] good thing and that can be very tragic
[20:01] because our thought about what someone
[20:04] deserves is like putting us in the
[20:06] position of God saying you deserve good
[20:08] and you deserve bad and we are not that
[20:11] that's not up to us now that's not to
[20:13] say we don't protect ourselves if
[20:15] someone is acting out and trying to hurt
[20:17] us Marshall never ever suggested just
[20:22] laying down and let someone hurt you
[20:24] know letting someone hurt you but
[20:26] protective use of force is very
[20:28] different than um than violent and
[20:31] aggressive use of force so yeah there's
[20:34] many many rabbit holes one can go down
[20:36] but I'll stop there so yeah being born
[20:38] out of pain it's both a system of rules
[20:41] not rulers you know with nonviolent
[20:44] communication and with Bitcoin you just
[20:48] um understand that we we transact on on
[20:52] a Level Playing Field here and that's
[20:55] you know very different than using
[20:57] language that powers over over somebody
[20:59] or using a financial system where you've
[21:01] got the candelon effect
[21:04] um they're both decentralized excuse me
[21:07] and they both rely on voluntary
[21:09] participation and
[21:11] collaboration interest yeah they're both
[21:14] in uh use proof of work and have lower
[21:16] time preference built in you know it
[21:19] takes a lot of time and energy to
[21:22] understand each of these systems to be
[21:25] willing to do the work for the rewards
[21:28] at the end
[21:29] and so like with big I mean sorry with
[21:33] nonviolent communication it's it takes
[21:35] honestly it takes well I'd say at least
[21:39] a couple years I mean unless you're an
[21:41] incredibly enlightened human being I
[21:44] considered myself pretty aware and
[21:46] conscious and I was
[21:48] astonished at how much we call it Jackal
[21:51] in NBC Jackal language Jackal thoughts
[21:54] judgments blame shame guilt was built
[21:57] into my World viw Without Me realizing
[22:00] it and and built into my language and
[22:03] into my thoughts about people and it
[22:06] took a lot of work and journaling and
[22:09] going through the book and the workbook
[22:10] and writing down the answers to like
[22:12] retrain my neural Pathways and to
[22:15] understand and and view things
[22:16] differently so yeah I can go on but I'll
[22:19] stop there because there are more um
[22:21] similarities and they will all be listed
[22:23] in the
[22:24] article it's it's also interesting when
[22:27] you think about the the judgmental
[22:30] judgmental thoughts that you have uh and
[22:34] the things that you then go ahead and
[22:36] actually say if you really want to clean
[22:38] out your thoughts that that's a whole
[22:40] another level it some you have thoughts
[22:44] in your head uh because maybe someone
[22:47] angries you or someone triggers you or
[22:49] annoys you but but then you're
[22:52] disciplined enough to still be nice to
[22:54] that person in that um in that situation
[22:58] uh just because it would you don't want
[23:01] to escalate it or like whatever the
[23:04] thing is so so some sometimes we have uh
[23:08] darker thoughts than come like there's a
[23:10] filter between our thoughts and the
[23:12] things that we actually say uh and uh
[23:16] filtering out what you say and what you
[23:18] do uh is great and it's al already very
[23:21] hard but then filtering out your
[23:23] thoughts uh and the judgmental things
[23:25] that you have in your mind is like oh
[23:27] like what what does he do here like like
[23:31] like if if he's doing something very
[23:35] small that isn't completely normal but
[23:38] it uh it's it's it's annoying you
[23:41] because it's not aligned with how you
[23:43] think the world is working uh but it's
[23:45] aligned with like law and moral things
[23:49] uh it's just like you thing you might
[23:52] think like you know like go away
[23:54] but that that that there's a discipline
[23:57] in there like you should not say that so
[23:59] having clearing out those thoughts I
[24:01] imagine being really really hard I I
[24:05] catch myself and I noticed that where
[24:07] I'm like saying in my head mean things
[24:10] about other people and later I'm like
[24:14] I'm so glad I never said that out
[24:17] loud yeah yeah yeah yeah and I would
[24:20] love I'm glad you brought that up
[24:21] because I'd like to clarify a couple
[24:23] things
[24:24] um with with non Okay so
[24:28] Marshall used the Jackal and the giraffe
[24:31] just as symbols and he actually used to
[24:33] use puppets he's he's amazing to watch
[24:35] in my opinion he's so um he had such a
[24:39] dry sense of humor and he he was someone
[24:42] that you could tell he had been through
[24:44] a lot you could tell that this was this
[24:46] was work for him to to do all of this it
[24:49] wasn't just look at this everybody just
[24:51] do this yeah yeah yeah no it was
[24:54] profound so he used the Jackal as a
[24:57] symbol for our judgments um uh you know
[25:00] our un Unleashed anger um frustrations
[25:04] that would our unconscious just habitual
[25:07] reactive side and then he used the
[25:09] giraffe as the symbol for our more
[25:12] conscious aware sort of using the
[25:14] prefrontal cortex our reason our empathy
[25:18] our compassion uh side
[25:21] and um with regards to what you're
[25:25] saying he never suggested that it was
[25:28] even
[25:29] possible to fully remove so I'm saying
[25:33] this sorry because I want to be clear
[25:35] that that that I'm not suggesting that
[25:38] we can completely remove the judgmental
[25:41] thoughts that they're just no longer
[25:43] there at
[25:44] all the the different and I actually
[25:47] said to him I asked him this question at
[25:48] one of the at one of the 10day Retreats
[25:50] I said Marshall are you telling us that
[25:53] you no longer ever have any judgments in
[25:56] your mind and he laughed and he's like
[25:59] oh no hell no he's like I still have him
[26:03] he said the difference and this is the
[26:06] profound part the difference is how
[26:08] little time I spend with those thoughts
[26:12] compared to how much time I used to
[26:14] spend with them so what he does now is
[26:18] he or did and taught us to do and I
[26:21] would say at this point I'm I I mean
[26:24] yeah with a lot it's been many years of
[26:26] practice I'm pretty it's pretty works
[26:28] for me this way now as well I spend very
[26:30] little time so I still have those
[26:32] thoughts but almost
[26:35] immediately I can find that place of
[26:38] compassion because what I what you do is
[26:41] you're like you try and guess what need
[26:44] that other person is meeting in this
[26:46] moment behaving the way they're behaving
[26:49] and what Marshall told us and what I in
[26:52] my experience agree with and understand
[26:55] is that everybody is always doing the
[26:57] best they can so that means that with
[27:02] their
[27:03] resources inner and outer whether that's
[27:07] education you know health wealth um
[27:12] environment family
[27:14] upbringing worldview everything that
[27:16] they've been programmed with by the
[27:18] society the the grace some people have
[27:22] had to do some inner work and not lash
[27:24] out whereas other people haven't
[27:26] received that blessing and
[27:29] you know it's hard because we can say
[27:31] well everyone could do it but if you
[27:34] don't know you have a choice then do you
[27:37] really have a
[27:39] choice you know so I don't know you know
[27:43] I I have compassion because I think a
[27:45] lot of people they don't have whatever
[27:48] it takes to do that in our work and so
[27:51] even if they're lashing out and doing
[27:52] horrible
[27:53] things I can hate their actions
[27:58] but I can still have compassion for the
[28:00] hurt human who's carrying out those
[28:04] actions as someone who doesn't know a
[28:07] better way right
[28:10] so I mean you know it's a big topic and
[28:13] I guess there's a lot of philosophical
[28:14] ways you could go with all that but but
[28:17] the bottom line to to respond to what
[28:19] you said yeah is that those thoughts
[28:20] don't just disappear but instead of
[28:23] harboring on them or or constantly in
[28:27] your mind mind seeing that person as an
[28:30] enemy or a bad person or labeling them
[28:33] as an idiot and then you still act nice
[28:36] because we're sort of social beings and
[28:39] we don't want to like you say escalate
[28:41] it but in our mind we continue carrying
[28:44] this label or what Marshall would call
[28:46] the enemy image of that other person we
[28:49] actually shift it within us so that we
[28:54] open up a different energy Channel
[28:57] between us and that person and it's
[28:59] quite remarkable
[29:02] actually you could try it sometime or
[29:04] the listeners if you're like at the
[29:06] grocery store or in line or in traffic
[29:07] somewhere and someone is you know taking
[29:10] way longer or they cut you off in
[29:12] traffic or whatever um well you know it
[29:15] helps I suppose if you can watch their
[29:17] reactions afterwards but so if you're
[29:19] somewhere and someone is doing something
[29:21] and they're just pissing you off and
[29:22] you're just super annoyed and calling
[29:23] them all kinds of
[29:25] names step back for a moment and just
[29:29] think I wonder like what need they're
[29:31] meeting or what they're going through
[29:33] right now like maybe they're having a
[29:35] really rough day maybe they just got
[29:37] like some of the worst news of their
[29:39] life like we don't know
[29:41] right and you'll notice both within you
[29:45] this like internal softening and this
[29:48] shift and often it's quite amazing but
[29:53] you'll notice a softening and a shift in
[29:55] the other person without even you saying
[29:58] a
[29:59] word and they might change their
[30:02] behavior they might like look up and
[30:04] look at you different or almost
[30:06] surprised because they feel something
[30:07] and they didn't even they don't know
[30:09] what's going on but something has
[30:11] shifted in the energy between you and um
[30:14] yeah so there's many profound ways and
[30:18] reasons to work with the judgments that
[30:21] we have of people in our own minds and
[30:25] uh and to also like Marshall said
[30:28] they're not going to go away he said if
[30:30] they're really bad what you could do is
[30:32] get a piece of paper and just write them
[30:34] all down use all your worst language all
[30:36] like just let it rip no filter you know
[30:39] give yourself license to just like fully
[30:43] lay it all down there and then go
[30:46] through the process of wow okay what am
[30:49] I really needing in this
[30:51] situation and usually you find feelings
[30:54] that are uncovered that are more
[30:56] vulnerable as well once you get through
[30:58] the anger anger usually is covering up
[31:01] more vulnerable feelings I partnered up
[31:04] with coin vigilante this is the most

[33:18] life hack yes like like like H how how
[33:24] in like I unfortunately don't do it on a
[33:26] regular basis
[33:28] uh but if I know I have like a hot face
[33:32] right now like that's like a bad month
[33:34] like a lot of things come together um I
[33:37] start to journal and just that one small
[33:40] action of like once a day you Journal
[33:43] you have like that routine in there it
[33:45] helps you a lot like it's just like the
[33:47] the same thoughts that in there just
[33:49] like writing it down uh that that's
[33:52] that's one thing that I I have found
[33:54] that helped me a lot with with those
[33:56] thoughts so also really really
[33:57] interesting when we think about all
[34:00] those interactions we we can have in our
[34:04] daily lives um where something comes up
[34:07] to you that you not you didn't wish for
[34:10] you you didn't plan for uh but you just
[34:14] I I just had that the other day I was in
[34:17] uh in the train uh and there is a guy
[34:21] coming in and he's taking all the
[34:23] magazines from the train uh and was uh
[34:27] very and politely speaking with everyone
[34:30] uh he might was just on drugs he might
[34:32] was alcoholic uh it was definitely um
[34:35] very far away from any normal Behavior
[34:39] Uh and the the the only thought that I
[34:42] actually had in my mind was like that
[34:45] first of all like I I I I will get my
[34:48] girlfriend next to me so like I'm
[34:50] between him because I'm two meters so I
[34:53] I'm less less likely to to be hit at
[34:57] like this physical protection thing
[34:59] going on but the the the main part
[35:02] because I never felt really threatened
[35:03] or anything I think he was not really
[35:05] violent he was just seeking for
[35:07] attention uh but the real feel was like
[35:10] I have a like I feel a lot of sadness
[35:13] right now for him I feel a lot of
[35:14] compassion for him because in for for a
[35:18] person to act like that means he he
[35:21] needs a lot of intention he might go
[35:23] through a really rough time yeah we
[35:25] always think we go through a rough time
[35:27] but then you see someone else who
[35:30] actually goes through a really rough
[35:32] time and you're like oh like my life is
[35:34] pretty good yeah yeah so that
[35:36] perspective helps a lot but yeah it's
[35:39] it's it's it's really interesting how it
[35:41] goes and and with that um maybe
[35:45] anchoring in um the the sound money
[35:49] conversation also is how do you think if
[35:54] we actually are on a Bitcoin standard if
[35:56] we actually are on a maybe just call it
[35:58] sound money standard I think it will be
[36:00] Bitcoin but let's just keep it at first
[36:03] principles sound money standard uh and
[36:06] everyone can save and all all the low
[36:08] time preference things that that we hope
[36:10] come from that how will it actually um
[36:13] make a difference in our communication
[36:15] in our everyday uh lives we all say also
[36:19] a lot like Bitcoin is UNF funding Wars
[36:22] like defunding Wars um is it also
[36:25] defunding aggression in communication
[36:28] and violence in
[36:29] communication I would say yes absolutely
[36:34] because because I think a lot of the
[36:37] disconnection the pain the anger the
[36:39] frustration that gets played out in
[36:43] people's lives and and then in their
[36:46] relationships and then between nations
[36:48] is because it's all a spectrum right
[36:50] violence is violence all the way from
[36:52] the personal to the the nation state and
[36:55] nation states are just made up of people
[36:57] anyway so so um I think that once we
[37:03] have sound money and oh sorry so to
[37:06] finish my my thought so a lot of that
[37:09] violence that gets played out is from
[37:11] literal stress and fear and that stress
[37:15] and fear is often because
[37:19] people do not know how they are going to
[37:23] survive sometimes next month never mind
[37:26] in their retirement
[37:28] so so whether it's the people that are
[37:31] living under the poverty line and
[37:33] literally don't know how to bring
[37:35] themselves up and also don't know how to
[37:37] pay rent next month that creates a level
[37:40] of stress in somebody's being that gives
[37:43] them a very short rope that when they
[37:46] are interacting with their Partners or
[37:48] their children they don't have much
[37:51] patience because that stress I mean
[37:53] stress is literally you know the amydala
[37:55] our our dinosaur brain you know at the
[37:58] base of the skull when that thing
[38:00] triggers and releases catac colomines
[38:03] and and um adrenaline and so on those
[38:06] are actual drugs they they're they're
[38:08] you know they're natural they're in our
[38:10] body but they have the effect of
[38:13] flooding our system and of cutting us
[38:15] off from our prefrontal cortex I mean on
[38:18] a biological level right and so people
[38:22] don't have the ability to communicate
[38:25] slowly clearly compassionately or in a
[38:27] connected manner because they're not
[38:28] even connected with themselves at that
[38:30] point and so I think having um a sound
[38:34] money system will just you know when
[38:36] when our savings mean something and when
[38:39] the value never mind deflation never
[38:41] mind prices going down how about just
[38:44] prices being stable and knowing that the
[38:47] money you earn is actually going to
[38:50] cover your bills next month and next
[38:52] year and then of course being able to
[38:55] plan for your retirements and so on
[38:57] these things are so fundamental because
[39:00] our core needs are our survival needs
[39:03] you know be before we have all those
[39:05] other needs that I was talking about
[39:07] earlier um just physical shelter food
[39:12] you know clean air clean
[39:15] water those are number one because
[39:17] without those none of the rest matters
[39:19] right so when we have those and then you
[39:22] can kind of extrapolate this whole thing
[39:24] into the Health Care system and and all
[39:26] of that which of course is big in the
[39:27] news right now in this country after
[39:30] what happened the other day but so
[39:32] People's Health you know and having the
[39:34] ability to know that if you get sick
[39:35] you're actually going to be able to
[39:37] afford your um your care will greatly
[39:42] relieve people and that relief will
[39:46] translate into the way people feel and
[39:48] the way they feel will translate into
[39:50] how they communicate so very basic stuff
[39:53] but I think it will make a massive
[39:55] massive difference
[39:57] and will greatly um enhance connection
[40:01] and and communication that's well I
[40:04] could stop there is more I would like to
[40:05] say real quick on that but do you want
[40:07] to say something first oh no like go go
[40:09] on go on okay so that all said I've been
[40:13] doing a little thought experiment with
[40:14] myself since writing this article you
[40:17] know if I had to choose one if I had to
[40:21] choose NVC or Bitcoin and I could only
[40:24] choose one which one do I think would
[40:26] ultimate itely be the most
[40:30] impactful and and have the biggest
[40:32] chance of bringing the most
[40:35] peace and I've I actually maybe you can
[40:39] can ponder this with me but I've gone I
[40:42] haven't I haven't found the solution
[40:44] because here or haven't chosen one
[40:46] because as I was just saying if we have
[40:49] sound money we will naturally have
[40:51] better communication I
[40:53] believe um because a lot of bad
[40:55] communication comes from stress right
[40:57] and fear
[41:00] and on the other hand if we have NVC
[41:04] spread throughout the world and people
[41:07] communicate with each other with respect
[41:09] with authenticity with um with
[41:13] compassion and Clarity and presence then
[41:16] I don't if if that was spread around the
[41:18] world I don't even think the Fiat system
[41:21] would even exist I think then we would
[41:24] naturally find another system to
[41:27] transact with because Fiat is such a lie
[41:31] and if you have a system of
[41:33] communication that's based on honesty
[41:35] and integrity you couldn't have a system
[41:37] of transaction that was based on
[41:39] lies and power over strategies and the
[41:43] candle on effect so I think honestly
[41:47] either one and that to me shows how
[41:49] profound both of these things
[41:52] are I think either one if you had to
[41:54] only choose one would actually naturally
[41:57] lead to the other one and the last thing
[42:01] I'll say on that is that I think nonv uh
[42:04] Bitcoin has a better chance at
[42:07] being the one that gets far furthest
[42:11] quickest
[42:13] because nonviolent communication has
[42:16] been around since like I mean I think it
[42:18] probably got popular in the 80s I would
[42:20] say you know Marshall started kind of
[42:23] formulating and working with it and
[42:24] spreading it sort of on by himself
[42:26] between the 6070s and then he slowly
[42:28] like he formed the center for nonviolent
[42:30] communication and then he started
[42:32] training other people to train people
[42:34] and so on and so forth and the center
[42:35] for nonviolent communication still
[42:37] exists and I highly recommend anybody
[42:40] checks that website out there's tons of
[42:42] free resources available um but it's
[42:47] been however many years what 40 years 50
[42:49] years and it's still very small in
[42:52] Niche whereas Bitcoin has been 15 years
[42:55] and it's already pretty much everybody
[42:58] knows the word even if they don't
[43:00] understand it yet and I think that's
[43:02] because um you know money is what we all
[43:06] use well I mean we communicate every day
[43:08] as well but I don't know we we we're
[43:11] sort of Addicted to Money in a sense an
[43:13] unhealthy addiction but it it is um it's
[43:18] a thing that I'm also curious with
[43:20] Nostra about if it actually has the
[43:22] power to to push through that because
[43:25] what what Bitcoin does is the most
[43:27] complicated thing on earth uh breaking
[43:29] up the central bank and financial system
[43:33] central bank system and financial system
[43:35] in general um but it will do that
[43:38] because every player has an incentive to
[43:42] join like the Larry think blackrook CEO
[43:47] one of the richest guys alive such an
[43:50] influential figure has the same
[43:52] incentive to join Bitcoin the network as
[43:56] um
[43:58] a struggling um uh mother of five kids
[44:03] without a man uh like like no matter
[44:06] what uh demographic you choose no matter
[44:09] what person you choose in this world
[44:12] everyone has a major incentive to join
[44:16] Bitcoin and a direct incentive like you
[44:19] join the network after 4 years you
[44:22] already see a lot of results you might
[44:25] even see the results after 4 months
[44:27] already and direct measurable uh success
[44:32] of that and that's where I think because
[44:35] NVC is longer there and I just
[44:38] discovered it I actually noticed that uh
[44:40] the when I saw the slides it looked
[44:42] familiar I think I learned about it uh I
[44:45] think a few years ago we made some
[44:48] courses outside of school but related to
[44:51] school uh where we learned about that
[44:53] actually we made a a one day trip and I
[44:56] think it was one part of that so when
[44:59] when I saw the slides when I saw that it
[45:02] it looked familiar to me again so that
[45:05] that's that's really interesting um but
[45:09] it's still like not everyone is in on
[45:11] there and I think Bitcoin already
[45:14] achieved so much in 15 years because it
[45:16] has an incentive like we are greedy
[45:19] people yes and we want more and more and
[45:22] we want more Bitcoin and and so we have
[45:25] the incentive to understand the
[45:26] technology and get really good in it so
[45:29] um I I I'm 100% agreeing with you where
[45:33] when everyone is uh communicating in a
[45:37] really good way like sound communication
[45:39] like NVC um I think that would um lead
[45:44] to bitcoin um but NVC lacks the
[45:48] financial incentive to spread like
[45:51] wildfire and and that's that's why I
[45:53] think Bitcoin um is already so
[45:57] uh far uh is already so far down the
[46:01] rabbit hole of getting breaking up that
[46:03] central bank system and getting into
[46:05] everyone's head like we we have
[46:07] countries now buying Bitcoin like it's a
[46:10] crazy time to be alive because there's
[46:12] this incentive there uh and that's why I
[46:16] tend towards Bitcoin being more
[46:19] important but um it's I I'm I'm
[46:25] cautiously saying that because um
[46:28] Bitcoin in the end of the day is just
[46:30] money and and money is a tool and a tool
[46:33] should not be the most important thing
[46:35] in your life so so well well well that
[46:39] and also because okay so now we've all
[46:42] got you know everybody's getting getting
[46:45] all their need that you know their
[46:47] financial needs met and they're having
[46:49] some Financial Freedom okay great but
[46:51] now you're still going to wake up next
[46:53] to that same person in bed if you're
[46:56] married or you know talk to your same
[46:58] kids every day and like yes so maybe
[47:01] there's some more ease in your family
[47:04] life because you're not stressed about
[47:06] how you're going to pay the rent but you
[47:09] still are having communication and when
[47:13] we've are when you start working with
[47:15] NBC and you realize or you maybe don't
[47:17] even need to work with it if you just
[47:18] think about yourself and your
[47:20] communication methodologies or the
[47:23] relationships you have with people
[47:24] around you even if because there's lot
[47:27] of very wealthy people they've got lots
[47:28] of money they've don't worry about how
[47:30] to pay the rent they don't have
[47:31] Financial stress and yet they've got
[47:33] horrible relationships so is that really
[47:37] and that's why people always say money
[47:38] you know doesn't buy happiness no
[47:41] because in the end what really brings
[47:43] you happiness is ultimately at the end
[47:46] of the day we always hear this from
[47:48] people looking back on their lives it's
[47:50] the relationships that you had and the
[47:53] the measure of like the levels of
[47:55] creativity you were able to bring to
[47:57] life and connection and and joy and and
[48:00] peace with the people around you every
[48:02] day so in that sense uh yes I think I'm
[48:07] back with you like it's cautious to say
[48:09] that okay if we had to choose one I
[48:12] think we just need both basically and we
[48:16] can have both and we can and that's the
[48:18] beauty we don't have to choose one and
[48:21] on the measure of incentives that's
[48:22] interesting what you were saying um I
[48:25] agree and I think what it is too as you
[48:28] were speaking something came up for me
[48:29] that I hadn't fully thought through yet
[48:31] and that's
[48:32] that another reason I think Bitcoin is
[48:36] is going to be more effective more
[48:38] quickly and is already being more
[48:40] effective more quickly is because uh
[48:44] hang on because
[48:46] we it gives you uh sorry I'm just losing
[48:49] my thread here I was like all in it a
[48:51] moment
[48:52] ago um I have that all the time yeah
[48:56] like sometimes I'm like I have that
[48:59] great question and then in the middle of
[49:01] asking a question I'm like where was I
[49:04] going with that I'm just like ending the
[49:06] questions somewhere
[49:08] else like you're talking to a guy that
[49:11] does that every day that happens to me a
[49:13] lot and it's inred impressive by the way
[49:16] yeah and sometimes like as I mean I
[49:19] don't I hope people don't notice that
[49:20] too much but sometimes the guest stops
[49:24] talking and I don't know where to stop
[49:26] hard and I just start somewhere and by
[49:30] the St of the sentence of the question I
[49:32] don't know where I end
[49:34] up usually I know it but there like
[49:37] those this one% of questions that I
[49:40] asked where I didn't knew in the
[49:42] starting where I will end up with where
[49:44] it just becomes a flow that's great
[49:46] that's like the flow in the moment and
[49:49] often that stuff is so valuable too
[49:51] right we we we go places that are
[49:53] unplanned and that ends up being where
[49:55] the gold or the or the Bitcoin
[49:58] and and I think that's what people
[49:59] really like the the authenticity of it
[50:02] where uh it's it's not scripted because
[50:05] yes I don't know maybe people don't know
[50:07] about that in the podcast but I don't
[50:09] share any questions before because I
[50:11] don't have any questions before that oh
[50:13] amazing okay I love it and and we don't
[50:17] like there's no script going on the I
[50:20] was um I had Michael zon and I thought
[50:23] he's always so well spoken and he's
[50:25] always so well prepared so I thought
[50:27] like maybe he wants to have questions
[50:29] before and asked his
[50:31] assistant does he want to have questions
[50:34] before should we talk about what's the
[50:36] topic on the podcast and she just said
[50:39] like
[50:40] no amazing he doesn't want to know what
[50:43] you will ask him he doesn't need to know
[50:46] you what will ask him uh he he can
[50:49] handle your
[50:50] questions and uh we we just went into
[50:53] the podcast and yes it was well spoken
[50:55] and extremely well prepared even though
[50:57] he had no clue who am I and no clue what
[51:00] I will ask and so I I approach every
[51:03] podcast like that um sometimes I I
[51:07] always write down like five to 10
[51:09] questions topics that I want to get into
[51:13] um but usually I never get to all of
[51:16] them anyway and I usually drift off
[51:20] somewhere like
[51:22] like so sorry sorry to interrupt so long
[51:25] but it's it's just like um I I really
[51:28] like conversations that that that's
[51:31] that's what I saw like a focus
[51:34] conversations between two people
[51:36] actually paying attention to each other
[51:38] is so rare these days that podcasting is
[51:41] the one place where I really like that
[51:44] yeah and I think that's what's so
[51:46] beautiful about your podcast is you can
[51:48] tell one can tell at least that's I
[51:50] could tell that there that there's a
[51:53] genuine conversation going on and yes I
[51:56] can verify it's totally unscripted I did
[51:58] not receive any questions
[52:01] either absolutely
[52:04] uh of further from the threet or did you
[52:07] catch it you know I did I caught it so
[52:10] so B I did so because um Bitcoin is
[52:14] about money and because our our it's
[52:16] because our core needs of survival are
[52:20] so critical before anything else we need
[52:23] the money to work and I think that's
[52:26] what it is because when the in the uh
[52:30] communication we all need that to work
[52:33] but it's not as critical to our literal
[52:36] survival it's critical to our what I
[52:39] call our thrival you know there survival
[52:41] needs and there's thrival needs is the
[52:44] way I see it and survival needs as I've
[52:46] said are food you know Water Shelter air
[52:49] warmth that's survival needs thrival
[52:52] needs is everything else Harmony love
[52:55] connection creativity joy peace you know
[52:58] challenge Fitness etc
[53:01] etc um I mean Fitness could be kind of
[53:04] go between both but yeah so so uh the
[53:08] survival needs because they're the most
[53:10] critical they relate in our world today
[53:12] for most people to money there's very
[53:15] few people out there surviving
[53:17] completely without any money very very
[53:20] very very few right and so I think
[53:23] that's it money just fulfills that um
[53:27] that so so so that's why people are
[53:29] going to be attracted first like you
[53:32] said we're greedy but I don't know even
[53:33] that's we greedy it's just an actual
[53:36] money is a strategy to meet the need for
[53:38] survival and because survival is the
[53:41] most core and most critical critical
[53:43] need before we can attend to any of the
[53:45] others money becomes the tool and the
[53:48] strategy that we're most interested in
[53:50] and there's another little piece to this
[53:53] is Bitcoin is actually we talk about
[53:55] proof of work and time preference and
[53:57] both of those are very true and very
[53:59] relevant at the same time if you're
[54:02] lucky and like you get into Bitcoin at
[54:04] the beginning or near the beginning or
[54:06] during a bull
[54:07] run it's not a lot of low time
[54:10] preference that's needed really the low
[54:13] time preference is needed during the
[54:14] bare market right and so for all the and
[54:19] and also because most people get in for
[54:22] the first time during a bull run right
[54:25] that's well known is that the masses
[54:27] always Jo the new masses come into
[54:30] Bitcoin during a bull run because that's
[54:32] when the excitement and the hype is
[54:34] there and that's when numbers going up
[54:36] and um so it actually doesn't take as
[54:40] much proof of work
[54:42] initially to get into Bitcoin whereas
[54:45] with nonviolent communication it takes
[54:48] proof of work from the very beginning
[54:51] and it's this is this was what I was
[54:53] actually trying to grasp earlier that I
[54:55] lost this fascinates me because I'd
[54:57] never thought about it before because
[54:59] one of the reasons I stopped teaching on
[55:02] an active in an active way nonviolent
[55:04] communication was because I got
[55:06] frustrated with having people come to a
[55:09] two or three day
[55:11] workshop and be so excited and so
[55:14] passionate and so into what we were
[55:16] doing and what they were
[55:18] learning and then that was it they just
[55:22] thought their life should change and no
[55:24] one wanted to put in the proof of work
[55:26] which which which can includes reading
[55:28] listening watching videos journaling
[55:32] attending weekly practice groups that
[55:34] are free like they didn't have to be
[55:35] with me my first Practice Group me and
[55:38] other people just formed together out of
[55:40] the workshop and and we didn't you know
[55:43] there was no one being paid or nothing
[55:44] was we just were obsessed and we wanted
[55:46] to learn more and we we used books and
[55:49] videos to teach ourselves and to discuss
[55:51] it amongst each other but that takes a
[55:53] lot of time and energy every single week
[55:56] for almost 10 years I was part of a
[55:58] Practice Group on a weekly basis before
[56:01] and then I was leading my own as well
[56:02] but but um so I'm just going like huh
[56:07] that's another reason that Bitcoin has
[56:09] been adopted more rapidly than
[56:11] nonviolent communication is because
[56:13] nonviolent communication actually
[56:15] requires immense amounts of proof of
[56:18] work right from the get-go um 97 because
[56:22] I studied this numbers when I started
[56:24] and did the podcast 9 7% of all podcasts
[56:29] stop after the third
[56:31] episode wow so like 97% of all podcasts
[56:36] start with one episode and never make it
[56:39] to the fourth episode wow and 99% of the
[56:43] podcasts stop after 20 episodes so if
[56:46] you are making a podcast with 21
[56:49] episodes you are already in the top 1%
[56:51] of all
[56:54] podast so um
[56:56] and I noticed that even in the Bitcoin
[56:59] scene I saw
[57:01] podcasts um that started after me and
[57:05] just for context I do it now one year uh
[57:08] they started after me they started with
[57:10] a lot of energy three times a week then
[57:14] uh after the first few weeks they're
[57:16] like oh wait sponsors are not coming
[57:19] from themselves and the guest is also
[57:21] hard work and and you have to put in
[57:23] consistent work every week and every day
[57:27] to keep it going and there are rough
[57:29] patches and it's all like stressful and
[57:32] it's not just like two people talking
[57:34] it's fun and you all get all that money
[57:38] um and then they see and then the proof
[57:41] of work is like not consistent anymore
[57:43] and you you get distracted and maybe you
[57:45] get a job offer and you get away from
[57:47] that or you get distracted in other
[57:50] sense or you just uh uh really bad with
[57:53] it and you're like I don't want to do
[57:55] that anymore so uh it it takes a lot of
[57:58] time a lot of work to actually build
[58:00] something that is sustainable over time
[58:02] and can build uh is sustainable for you
[58:05] and maybe even like a team behind you
[58:08] and the same thing I think applies to
[58:10] everything that's why I like proof of
[58:12] work and the Bitcoin eers and mindset so
[58:15] much because if you have nonviolent
[58:17] communication and you work on yourself
[58:20] uh for communication and everything else
[58:23] um you it's it's not like oh like I I
[58:25] visit that one seminar now I know how it
[58:28] is and I don't have to do anything even
[58:30] the best communicators always have to
[58:33] work on their communication and never
[58:35] have to stop with that like that the
[58:37] consistent like every week every day
[58:40] every month every
[58:42] year getting better and stuff like that
[58:45] it never stops like you always can
[58:47] improve something and if you if you if
[58:49] you're not enhancing if you're not
[58:51] improving you're stagnate you're
[58:53] stagnating and that might be fine some
[58:56] areas uh but if you talk about something
[58:59] so difficult like
[59:01] communication you you probably should
[59:03] work on it because maybe you fall back
[59:05] in bad habits and you fall back in in
[59:07] Old behaviors and stuff like that
[59:10] absolutely absolutely and you don't see
[59:14] the challenge with with especially
[59:16] nonviolent communication is you don't
[59:18] see the changes immediately and just to
[59:21] compare again to getting into Bitcoin
[59:23] during a bull run you immediately see
[59:25] number go within a day or within a week
[59:27] it's like yeah yeah it's working it's
[59:29] happening okay Diamond hands yeah
[59:32] Diamond hands are easy during a bull run
[59:34] but because that's when most people get
[59:35] in they they have that doping rush and
[59:39] the hit and the validation this is
[59:41] working this is good this is great and
[59:44] it's kind of easy they don't really have
[59:45] to put in the proof of work initially
[59:48] whereas with nonviolent communication
[59:49] there is no dopamine hit at the
[59:51] beginning it takes weeks months
[59:55] sometimes a year you you know it depends
[59:56] how consistent you are with your
[59:58] practice as to how quickly you will see
[60:01] the changes if you dive in and you do
[60:05] your daily journaling and your daily
[60:07] practice you will start to see some
[60:10] shifts I would say within
[60:12] weeks but to do anything daily for weeks
[60:16] like you were just pointing out with the
[60:18] podcasts that takes already so much
[60:21] proof of work that in general people
[60:25] don't for whatever
[60:27] reason you know I think we're part of a
[60:30] throwaway Society I think proof of work
[60:32] used to be common in our world
[60:34] everything only came by proof of work
[60:36] back in the day and now that we have the
[60:39] Disposable Society um things just come
[60:43] they're they're easy come easy go and
[60:45] proof of work has become the the Rarity
[60:47] in the world so so yeah fascinating okay
[60:52] thank you absolutely that's it's really
[60:54] interesting um maybe on that note how
[60:58] has Bitcoin impacted your life wow um
[61:03] well well like so much it's it's
[61:07] quite um mindboggling really for me I
[61:11] think teaching me I think even the
[61:14] concept of proof of work I had never
[61:18] fully even grasped that like I didn't
[61:20] use that term when I was doing
[61:21] nonviolent communication before I was
[61:24] just doing it and I was
[61:26] very incentive my incentive to do it
[61:30] like I said was my kids and and I loved
[61:33] them more than anything in the world and
[61:34] I wanted to communicate with them well
[61:37] and model good communication and and
[61:39] healthy relationships with them so I had
[61:42] a strong incentive but I didn't
[61:44] understand that that was proof of work I
[61:46] didn't understand sort of incentives in
[61:49] that sense I didn't understand first
[61:51] principles I didn't even understand
[61:54] private property I came it really helped
[61:56] me to understand the value of private
[61:59] property I was sort of this of this sort
[62:01] of idealistic uh egalitarian you
[62:05] know we can all be equal and we can all
[62:08] have the same stuff and and all of this
[62:12] complete you
[62:13] know mindset that I now understand is
[62:17] just so um kind of built in the clouds
[62:20] and not at all grounded in reality and
[62:23] so it's really taught me about proof of
[62:25] work it's Tau me about the value and the
[62:27] necessity to to understand and honor and
[62:31] um and how important private property is
[62:36] it's there's so many things I'm just
[62:38] trying to find words really um I mean
[62:42] it's it's taught me that I can have
[62:46] really great relationships and learn a
[62:49] lot from people that I would have never
[62:52] given the time a day to in my life
[62:55] before
[62:56] for because we share this fundamental
[62:59] understanding
[63:01] now about this the importance of sound
[63:06] money and integrity at the base layer of
[63:09] that and because we share that and the
[63:13] and you know decentralization
[63:14] immutability scarcity like these
[63:16] fundamental core um properties and we
[63:21] understand the importance of them it's
[63:23] like I can now trust you as a person not
[63:27] you but someone right who I well you
[63:31] too but like who I might have different
[63:35] political or social views or cultural
[63:38] views or thoughts and yet I can I so
[63:42] crazy to me but like I can honor and
[63:45] allow you to have all of that because I
[63:48] know that you are going to honor and
[63:51] allow me to have mine and we're not
[63:52] going to try and change each other but
[63:55] we're also we're not going to mess with
[63:56] each other
[63:58] either and um and we're just going to
[64:00] let each other be and we can still
[64:04] transact and I don't know to me that's
[64:07] really profound and so like I don't
[64:08] throw the baby out with the bath water
[64:10] like I used to you know even with NVC I
[64:13] was still J not yeah I was still
[64:16] judgmental in the sense of like oh no I
[64:19] don't agree with with your views about
[64:21] that so now I'm not going to give you
[64:23] the time of day or try and listen or
[64:25] understand and other things that you're
[64:27] saying I'm not talking about someone
[64:28] personal in my life no that I would do
[64:31] because I want to have those good
[64:32] relations but I'm just talking about you
[64:34] know people in the media or people in
[64:36] this case on Twitter spaces or you know
[64:39] um yeah it's it's really open me to be
[64:42] able to connect with a vast more huge
[64:46] segment of society which which actually
[64:48] I guess takes me to that point of
[64:51] where Bitcoin will bring peace to Earth
[64:55] in that way never mind just by defunding
[64:58] War
[64:59] largely but by allowing humans to
[65:01] communicate and learn from each other
[65:03] who before would not have been open to
[65:05] learning from each other so I think
[65:08] those are some of the biggest ways that
[65:10] are coming off the top of my head right
[65:12] now um you know obviously also just the
[65:16] the very basic things with Bitcoin like
[65:17] simply the ability to send money to
[65:20] anybody anywhere I mean that's just
[65:22] so incredible and that just brings a
[65:25] measure of ease to one's life on a daily
[65:27] basis when you need or want to do that
[65:30] that's profound or if I want to donate
[65:32] to a project or to something fantastic
[65:33] that I see happening in the world I can
[65:35] just do it with no middleman you know no
[65:39] intermediary no need to ask permission
[65:41] and it's instant and you know of course
[65:44] there's all of those you know properties
[65:46] that we we all love about Bitcoin but
[65:49] yeah I think those three things I
[65:51] mentioned before are some of the most
[65:53] profound for me that are coming right
[65:55] now
[65:56] it's interesting you also wrote a book
[65:58] uh it's it's super interesting I love
[66:01] the book title the simplest Bitcoin book
[66:04] ever
[66:05] written how did you come the bad
[66:09] conclusion you mean it to that
[66:12] title the title and maybe also what
[66:15] inspired you to to even write that that
[66:17] that book in the first place yeah the
[66:20] the book and I have mentioned this
[66:22] excuse
[66:23] me on a couple other pods um the so I I
[66:28] won't go into it too much but basically
[66:30] I decided a couple years ago that I
[66:31] needed to tell everybody that I knew
[66:33] about Bitcoin like more than I had
[66:36] before because I I'm not living in the
[66:38] same place I I lived for a long time and
[66:41] so I wasn't seeing the people that I
[66:43] knew well on a daily basis anymore and I
[66:45] thought well I should just write an
[66:46] email and just kind of explain
[66:48] everything to everybody and they can
[66:49] take it or leave it but at least I've
[66:51] done my part to kind of share what I've
[66:53] learned uh because I've been down the
[66:55] rabbit hole now almost 8 years so I I
[66:58] learned a lot you know I had learned a
[67:00] lot and I thought it was time to really
[67:01] share it and so I started the email and
[67:05] it just went on and on and on and on and
[67:07] I thought to myself nobody's going to
[67:08] read this I have to make this readable
[67:10] somehow so I went back and I made bullet
[67:13] points and try to break it into sections
[67:15] I thought okay well that looks better
[67:17] you know and then and then I kept
[67:18] writing and then I was just like Noah
[67:21] this is too long this is actually a book
[67:23] and that's literally how it happened and
[67:25] I just C copy and pasted that entire
[67:27] email that I never sent into a Word
[67:29] document and and just kept going so
[67:33] that's how it came about and then the
[67:34] title I don't know it literally just
[67:37] came to me in a Flash and I just thought
[67:38] okay that's it I'm just going to call it
[67:40] that because I just didn't I don't know
[67:42] it just it was literally that and of
[67:45] course my husband laughed when he read
[67:47] it he's like there's no way this is the
[67:48] simplest book ever written and he's like
[67:50] this is not simple and I'm like well
[67:52] okay you write the simplest book then
[67:56] to me this is pretty darn simple I feel
[67:58] like I'm just
[68:01] introducing all the all the different
[68:04] aspects angles Concepts some of the you
[68:06] know monetary history like some of the
[68:09] basic Tech um you know I I felt like I
[68:14] was doing it as simply as I could and
[68:17] then also part of the the title refers
[68:20] to the way the book is laid out you know
[68:22] which you can see is just bullet points
[68:25] and they're like orange little Bitcoin
[68:26] bees but so they they kind of make
[68:29] things stand out and there's not too
[68:31] many words on a page there's a lot of
[68:33] space I had this idea of making it like
[68:36] this once I started actually doing the
[68:38] book WR you know continuing that email I
[68:41] I had this idea of making it one of
[68:43] those books you could pick up you know
[68:46] and open onto any page and find
[68:48] something valuable find like a nugget of
[68:50] information that you could digest for
[68:52] the rest of the day without having to
[68:54] read like the whole chapter
[68:56] so that was my idea of of how I wanted
[69:00] to approach it and um yeah it's been
[69:02] downloaded probably like over 3,000
[69:04] times now because it's been always a
[69:06] free download available on the website
[69:08] it still is and then um yeah I've sold I
[69:13] guess almost 1,000 copies of and and
[69:15] given away two copies of the paperback
[69:19] yeah and it's on sale right now for this
[69:21] month really cool perfect um that that's
[69:25] that's super interesting to to have the
[69:27] simplest Bitcoin book ever
[69:30] written I like that idea I mean uh there
[69:34] there is we really have to make it more
[69:36] simple I think if we we Bitcoin is
[69:39] really good in complicated stuff uh and
[69:42] getting stuff working uh and I think we
[69:45] have to get better to explain Bitcoin in
[69:48] an easier way we we relied in the first
[69:53] 15 years on the financial incentives for
[69:55] people to get it we just like yeah I
[69:57] have fun staying poor and that strategy
[70:01] actually works like because if you say
[70:04] that to someone it's like hey you can
[70:06] adopt Bitcoin now or you buy it later
[70:08] for way more money if that person keeps
[70:11] that in his head and then three years
[70:14] later he actually sees the Bitcoin price
[70:16] running up like two three x he's like oh
[70:17]  like maybe he's right so we uh the
[70:20] financial incentives allows us to be be
[70:23] bad Educators but right I think we
[70:26] should be great Educators and should be
[70:29] better in it to even accelerate the
[70:31] trend and even accelerate that but even
[70:34] if we all bad Educators people Bitcoin
[70:36] will still exceed just because of the
[70:38] financial incentive that it h gives
[70:41] everyone so I I like the idea of
[70:43] simplifying Bitcoin of simplifying uh
[70:46] things and uh getting it to more
[70:49] people's hand that's that's what all
[70:52] good bitcoiners should try to do uh in
[70:55] at the end of the day get Bitcoin to as
[70:58] many people as as you possibly can
[71:01] because that's how you actually improve
[71:02] the world as we also said Bitcoin leads
[71:05] to um some do so many great things and I
[71:09] I wholeheartedly agree with that yes yes
[71:13] yes yep no I agree and I think I think
[71:16] fortunately there are many many
[71:18] Educators working you know tirelessly
[71:21] most of us just voluntarily on different
[71:24] types of
[71:25] education you know strategies platforms
[71:28] there's the plan B Network there's
[71:30] there's so many um and yeah to continue
[71:35] to simplify it
[71:37] absolutely we have to be on that that
[71:40] Journey yeah yeah I'm I'm actually
[71:42] working on I've just started sort of
[71:45] reaching out to some devs I'm going to
[71:48] start it's it's not really a podcast
[71:50] although I'll probably release it I'm
[71:52] going to start it as spaces on Twitter
[71:55] and then streamed on Noster and maybe
[71:58] zap stream and and so on and then I'll
[72:00] record them and potentially put it out
[72:03] as a podcast and my idea is to have um
[72:06] each week a developer from a project so
[72:10] whether it's Z app or blue wallet or or
[72:13] Phoenix wallet or or you know any of the
[72:16] hardware Sig signing devices the actual
[72:19] tools that we use to bitcoin with to to
[72:22] store and secure our Bitcoin um and have
[72:26] them walk us through like I will be act
[72:29] like a beginner and invite people who
[72:32] want to listen who have never used this
[72:34] tool before and we all go through it
[72:36] together so then like we download the
[72:38] app we open the app okay we click here
[72:40] we do this and and then I ask the
[72:42] developer questions as I go we go into
[72:44] the settings to kind of understand a
[72:46] little more about what's there because I
[72:48] think a lot of times people just you
[72:50] know download an app and they like use
[72:53] send and receive and they don't really
[72:54] know anything else about what the app is
[72:56] capable of or what would be useful for
[72:58] them to know so that's something that I
[73:01] want to do to contribute to the space is
[73:03] bring some more of the like information
[73:06] around the tech that's available and
[73:09] that we use what but some people use a
[73:11] lot of people don't yet and maybe
[73:14] they're intimidated you know make it
[73:15] very beginner friendly but also
[73:17] intermediate friendly so that's not
[73:20] necessarily simplifying what Bitcoin is
[73:23] but but it's simplifying the tool tools
[73:25] that we that are available to us so yeah
[73:28] I'm excited about that actually because
[73:31] um I don't think there's enough emphasis
[73:33] on that in the
[73:35] space 100% agreed with that uh really
[73:39] really cool um the FL time the fly the
[73:42] time flew by really quickly um and I
[73:46] think I have to think about maybe doing
[73:48] the podcast longer but I I try to keep
[73:50] it at like one hour but I scor that my
[73:53] podcast get
[73:55] longer sometimes um I have two I have
[73:59] one question that I always ask my guest
[74:01] is what can we learn from you besides
[74:04] Bitcoin and we we talked so much about
[74:08] something else than Bitcoin today I will
[74:10] flip that uh uh question today uh just a
[74:14] little bit um what can we learn from you
[74:18] uh on bitcoin which might be surprising
[74:21] or what was hard for you to to crash in
[74:24] the beginning like what what was like
[74:26] one thing that you want to share that
[74:28] you learned with Bitcoin uh uh about
[74:35] something I gosh I I think I've sort of
[74:38] said the things um yeah I'm not having
[74:44] something something that I learned about
[74:46] Bitcoin that was surprising to
[74:49] me I said well it wasn't you know I
[74:51] learned it from Jeff Booth I guess just
[74:53] the idea
[74:56] that when you have sound money that's
[74:59] scarce that has a hard Cap
[75:01] supply and you and that is in a world
[75:05] that is technologically advancing that
[75:08] prices will continue to go
[75:11] down I think for me that's some I'm
[75:13] still actually trying to wrap my head
[75:15] around that but that is just something
[75:17] that completely surprised and fascinated
[75:19] me that I had never thought about before
[75:21] could never have imagined was would be
[75:23] possible and I'm still working on
[75:26] actually understanding that in a way
[75:28] like I couldn't explain that to a
[75:30] 5-year-old yet and I feel like I should
[75:32] be able to but I
[75:33] can't it's a hard concept definitely
[75:36] yeah I I agree with that um really cool
[75:39] we have an end routine in the podcast
[75:40] where the previous guest is asking a
[75:43] question for the next guest without
[75:45] knowing who the next guest actually is
[75:47] and the previous guest asked you the
[75:48] question do you know what an npop is and
[75:52] what it is used for
[75:55] an
[75:57] npub in in
[75:59] Noster yeah he he was he was going for
[76:04] nost yeah it's your Noster public key
[76:07] for sure and it's you know it's it's the
[76:10] key that you use like in Bitcoin you've
[76:12] got your public and private key and the
[76:15] public key in Bitcoin generates your
[76:17] addresses your receive addresses and in
[76:19] Noster your npub is your um it's like
[76:24] your nost address that you can give to
[76:26] people to find you in the Noster Pro in
[76:29] the Noster
[76:30] ecosystem and so yeah did you uh include
[76:34] Noster into the book yes in the second
[76:38] edition there's a whole chapter on
[76:40] Noster that I think is a pretty simple
[76:42] overview I would love to hear your or
[76:44] anybody else's feedback on what you
[76:47] think of it but I I did that was one of
[76:49] the reasons I did a second edition uh
[76:52] which was released in July of this year
[76:55] and actually was the bestselling book at
[76:57] Nashville at the official merch Booth um
[77:00] so that was surprising to me and and
[77:02] lovely to hear but the reason I did it
[77:04] was to update all the numbers and stats
[77:06] and the inflation numbers and things
[77:08] like that because I have some some of
[77:10] that in the book and then was to add a
[77:13] chapter on Noster because to me Noster
[77:15] is to communication as big is to freedom
[77:19] of of communication as Bitcoin is to
[77:21] freedom of
[77:22] transaction so yeah that's that's
[77:26] a I I love that you included Nostra in
[77:29] in the book I think it's it's something
[77:31] that we we should learn with with
[77:34] Bitcoin it should not be the the first
[77:37] thing probably like it should be a
[77:38] little bit later than that but I love
[77:40] that you uh put it in there I think is a
[77:43] really important stepping stone in
[77:46] scaling Bitcoin to the masses and I hope
[77:49] that Nostra is successful I'm still not
[77:51] convinced that Nostra will be successful
[77:54] though and the same extent that I'm very
[77:58] certain that Bitcoin is successful and
[77:59] will be successful but uh I I hope that
[78:03] Nostra will be successful and is that
[78:06] future communication layer that that we
[78:09] can use online and then use to transact
[78:12] transact our thoughts with uh if you say
[78:15] so our thoughts and our Bitcoin I really
[78:18] hope it succeeds because if we don't
[78:20] have a free way to interact online how
[78:24] are we going to transfer our
[78:26] Bitcoin with people that we've never met
[78:28] oh yeah like I'm I'm totally sold on the
[78:31] idea that we will have a technology like
[78:32] that okay know like if if Nostra will be
[78:37] that like uh like um we the internet
[78:42] allows us for free communication and we
[78:45] kind of we kind of got away from that
[78:48] path in the past like few years and we
[78:51] have to get back on there and uh I have
[78:55] a lot of Hope for that like I'm very
[78:57] certain that that we will get there but
[79:00] I just don't like I I didn't research
[79:02] Nostra deep enough to have the
[79:03] conviction and say Nostra is the way to
[79:05] do that uh but I probably
[79:08] should I also got too late into Bitcoin
[79:11] with 2020 right that's I'm a I'm a late
[79:16] majority early majority I don't know
[79:19] early yeah absolutely it's very early
