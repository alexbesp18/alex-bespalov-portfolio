[00:00] I really did believe in
[00:01] hyperbitcoinization that this thing was
[00:02] going to be gravity that sucked all
[00:04] value into it you know Infinity over 21
[00:07] million these kinds of numberg go up
[00:09] ideas I don't think that's realistic
[00:11] anymore all those caveats in there are
[00:13] true like you can't just say lightning
[00:15] is strictly better um it's cheaper and
[00:17] everybody should use it and there's no
[00:19] trade-offs there's tons of trade-offs
[00:21] honestly the only political or White
[00:23] Market Behavior I can justify is
[00:25] fighting for Bitcoin rights in other
[00:27] words putting it into law that I can
[00:30] have a Bitcoin wallet that I can you
[00:33] know sell anything I want you know sell
[00:35] for Bitcoin instead of for dollars or
[00:38] things that I'm allowed explicitly
[00:40] allowed to do instead of rules about how
[00:44] I can do things it's meant to be a black
[00:47] market money which means operating
[00:48] without permission and the government
[00:50] there is to enforce you know laws
[00:52] permissions um and to enforce them with
[00:55] violence so like Bitcoin can't do
[00:57] anything about violence so we have to be
[01:00] careful with the power that we entrust
[01:01] in the government and how they interplay
[01:04] with
[01:05] [Music]
[01:08] Bitcoin before we get started with the
[01:10] Bitcoin topics uh a quick overview like
[01:13] what are you doing in Bitcoin and and
[01:15] and what is for you the the most
[01:16] important aspect of of Bitcoin um so
[01:19] I've been in Bitcoin since late 2012 so
[01:23] I don't know 12 13 years um the most
[01:28] important thing I do is synonym our
[01:31] company um and basically what I what I
[01:33] try to do both as a bitcoiner and as CEO
[01:36] at synonym
[01:38] is separate all of the kind of
[01:41] and narratives and claims into you know
[01:45] more realistic um perspectives and
[01:49] understanding of both Bitcoin to then be
[01:51] able to have more interesting things the
[01:54] least interesting to us to build um at
[01:57] our company synonym by process of elim a
[02:00] of the things that don't make
[02:01] sense you so you you're building uh
[02:05] solutions for Bitcoin or what what is it
[02:08] done so the vision of synonym is we're
[02:11] building something that we call the
[02:12] atomic economy which is just a concept
[02:15] and it's most similar to the concept
[02:17] that maybe some of your audience has
[02:19] heard as far as the concept of
[02:20] hyperbitcoinization this idea of a
[02:23] future where like everybody only uses
[02:25] Bitcoin and everybody pays for
[02:27] everything in Bitcoin and Bitcoin is the
[02:29] only money
[02:30] um that's the kind of extreme you know
[02:32] short version of the idea of
[02:34] hyperbitcoinization well Atomic economy
[02:36] is a more abstract idea that's related
[02:39] and simply just what is a way that we
[02:41] could actually design a society
[02:44] intentionally and tools that people
[02:46] would use to replace the systems that
[02:49] currently oppress us not just the money
[02:51] and Banks but also you know big state
[02:54] and big Tech so we try to basically you
[02:57] know create an ecosystem of software and
[03:00] open protocols that people can use to
[03:03] replace big Tech big state and big
[03:06] Banks so in a sense it's uh almost like
[03:09] a parallel economy that you're trying to
[03:11] do exactly yes really cool I like that
[03:15] um how do you look then at it seems like
[03:19] the the current system wants to
[03:21] integrate Bitcoin and not like the other
[03:23] way around how do you look at
[03:25] governments big corporations big tech
[03:28] and and all those things uh trying to uh
[03:31] incorporate and in in integrate Bitcoin
[03:34] in in their lives like the ETFs are so
[03:36] popular and stuff like that well it just
[03:39] depends on what the context of the
[03:41] conversation is right like a you can't
[03:44] fault a bank for trying to do Bank
[03:46] things or a a Wall Street investor for
[03:49] trying to do Wall Street investor things
[03:50] or an ETF company for doing ETF things
[03:53] Etc so I'm not saying anybody should or
[03:56] should not be able to do these kinds of
[03:58] things it's what they do but I don't
[04:00] consider um Legacy Finance adoption of
[04:04] Bitcoin to be scaling of Bitcoin in any
[04:08] sort of you know practical sense I
[04:10] consider it to be you know a scaling of
[04:13] banking or you know into you know new
[04:15] products and and new technologies and so
[04:18] when we talk about scaling specifically
[04:20] when it comes to bitcoin I don't include
[04:23] you know things like custodial growth or
[04:26] state growth um State growth
[04:29] particularly is one that's divisive
[04:31] because the state is like the worst
[04:33] enemy of Bitcoin and seeing people
[04:36] Embrace politicians and the states
[04:39] consider things like a a strategic
[04:42] Bitcoin Reserve or special regulations
[04:45] for Bitcoin I think that some bitcoiners
[04:47] may find that those things are less
[04:50] desirable than they thought they would
[04:51] be yeah especially now with the shitcoin
[04:55] Strategic Reserve that they're doing
[04:57] right like you're not going to qu
[04:58] they're politicians they're they're
[05:00] there to Pander to the people that are
[05:02] the most powerful near them they're not
[05:04] there necessarily to like make you rich
[05:07] and so you know if that's what you think
[05:09] is going to happen that somebody's going
[05:10] to make you rich then you have the wrong
[05:12] idea about it it's it's it's a weird
[05:14] concept uh of
[05:16] cheering for governments to be more
[05:19] powerful with adopting Bitcoin uh and I
[05:23] it's all almost like a good thing that
[05:25] they're also doing coining uh so so
[05:28] don't they don't accumulate too many
[05:29] Bitcoins uh so the government doesn't
[05:32] get to good of that yeah I see what you
[05:34] mean I don't know that I would word it
[05:36] that way but I do see what you mean and
[05:38] just that I I think that delaying
[05:40] government involvement and just ignoring
[05:43] government as much as you can is one of
[05:45] the better strategies only because the
[05:48] government is just antithetical to
[05:50] bitcoin it's it's meant to be a black
[05:52] market money which means operating
[05:54] without permission and the government
[05:56] there is to enforce you know laws
[05:58] permissions um and to enforce them with
[06:00] violence so like Bitcoin can't do
[06:03] anything about violence so we have to be
[06:05] careful with the power that we entrust
[06:07] in the government and how they interplay
[06:09] with Bitcoin do you think we we will
[06:12] come to a state where this like black
[06:15] market this Bitcoin hyper Bitcoin say
[06:19] hyper bized system will be the only one
[06:22] uh where we kind of get get rid of the
[06:24] other
[06:25] one no um I think that that's kind of a
[06:28] naive idea I used to subscribe to the
[06:31] idea myself in the early years of
[06:33] Bitcoin where I really did believe in
[06:35] hyperbitcoinization that this thing was
[06:37] going to be the gravity that sucked all
[06:39] value into it you know Infinity over 21
[06:42] million these kinds of numberg go up
[06:44] ideas I don't think that's realistic
[06:47] anymore I think that people you know
[06:50] treat Bitcoin like another option for
[06:52] money another option for you know uh
[06:55] speculation another option for quote
[06:57] unquote store of value medium Exchange
[06:59] currency whatever you want to call it um
[07:02] it can be any of those things to any of
[07:04] those people none of those things to
[07:05] most people whatever um so I think that
[07:08] there's always going to be like
[07:10] competition across monies and places to
[07:12] put your money and speculate so and it's
[07:16] an advantage like we want competition it
[07:18] it's a natural thing to have competition
[07:21] like the first thing that would happen
[07:22] in a world where only Bitcoin existed is
[07:24] somebody would invent another
[07:26] alternative like you know what I mean
[07:27] somebody would say oh you like Bitcoin
[07:29] well you could do this instead and then
[07:31] there would be an alternative so you
[07:33] can't really like force the vision of
[07:36] hyperbitcoinization so much as maybe uh
[07:40] modernize the idea of Bitcoin maximalism
[07:43] to be maximizing as many users doing as
[07:46] many transactions as possible in in
[07:49] Bitcoin and that's all you can really do
[07:52] this is going to be a limit though
[07:53] because Bitcoin doesn't scale very well
[07:56] interesting and and I want to get into
[07:57] the the scaling of of also because I
[08:00] think it's really interesting but first
[08:01] like staying on on on that topic a
[08:03] little bit how would you how would you
[08:06] determine if Bitcoin was successful uh
[08:09] in the future a lot of people say like
[08:11] oh like Bitcoin needs to be the money or
[08:13] like or Bitcoin needs to be at that
[08:16] adoption rate like how do we determine
[08:18] in the future if if Bitcoin is
[08:20] successful well I mean what is
[08:23] successful is subjective right like you
[08:25] define what the qualifications are they
[08:29] need to be met to whether you you define
[08:31] something as a success right it's your
[08:33] own outcome so you define whether it's
[08:35] successful I personally Define it it
[08:38] isn't something that we're all going to
[08:39] be able to look at and say yep we were
[08:41] all right it's successful I mean you can
[08:44] kind of do that in the sense that the
[08:45] price keeps going up over you know a
[08:47] 15year span and such but you know what
[08:50] it whether it's successful is simply
[08:53] whether or not it solved the problem
[08:54] that you intended when you got involved
[08:57] um if you owned Bitcoin to get rich it
[08:59] made you rich then it was successful if
[09:01] you owned Bitcoin to be able to
[09:03] circumvent you know border limitations
[09:07] with money in banking and it works for
[09:09] you on that day then it's successful you
[09:11] know if you're trying to evade some sort
[09:13] of censorship whatever it may be it's
[09:16] successful but if it doesn't live up to
[09:18] those things in your specific situation
[09:21] then it's not like if you end up getting
[09:23] caught because of you know onchain
[09:25] privacy isn't that great or you end up
[09:27] getting or or your real life privacy
[09:28] isn't that great or you end up buying
[09:31] the top and selling the bottom because
[09:33] you have no choice because of personal
[09:35] finances then it didn't work for you and
[09:37] so you know it's okay to be realistic
[09:40] about all of this the the idea is just
[09:43] simply that Bitcoin does have a limited
[09:45] amount Bitcoin is sens Su resistant and
[09:48] so if you want to focus on some of these
[09:50] qualities and bet in the speculate on
[09:52] the future that this will turn out that
[09:54] the way you hope go for it um so far
[09:57] it's working out you know in certain
[09:59] ways better than others and maybe it
[10:01] will continue to do that that's super
[10:03] interesting of of of defining the
[10:06] success uh on an individual basis
[10:09] because someone can hardle Bitcoin for
[10:12] 10 years and have great success by never
[10:14] selling and and and having kind of the
[10:17] vision that they had in the beginning
[10:19] played out and someone had maybe the
[10:21] same vision uh but they they
[10:25] continuously sold it at the the wrong
[10:27] times uh so they didn't
[10:29] connected Bitcoin with success uh so
[10:32] that's really interesting of like it's
[10:34] an individual basis and it's really hard
[10:37] to also for me to find I mean the price
[10:40] is one aspect of it uh to to Define one
[10:44] major metric of like okay how how big is
[10:47] Bitcoin now and the price is kind of an
[10:50] interesting one but they also more like
[10:51] how many notes do we have how big is the
[10:54] mining hash rate uh how how many wallets
[10:58] with more like I don't know like
[11:00] thousands of toes out there and stuff
[11:02] like
[11:03] that do you have any metric that you
[11:05] look at of of kind of tracking the
[11:07] adoption of of of Bitcoin the rate of
[11:10] adoption well I can see that for all
[11:14] qualities the price is probably the best
[11:16] metric we have um because if the price
[11:18] is healthy then it's because that
[11:21] there's a demand for it right like it's
[11:23] just supply and demand so as long as
[11:25] we're meeting you know supply and demand
[11:27] and demand is increasing you know then
[11:29] the price will continue to go up so it's
[11:31] a pretty good metric other things are
[11:33] much more difficult and unreliable to
[11:35] measure like we have some data that we
[11:37] can look at but you have to really infer
[11:39] a lot like you have all the blockchain
[11:41] data you can start looking at you know
[11:43] you know how much people are spending on
[11:45] fees how big the transactions they're
[11:47] sending are but you don't know whether
[11:49] people are just mixing their own coins
[11:51] or sending things to themselves like you
[11:54] don't know a lot about the context of
[11:57] the the transaction so to measure that
[11:59] Health through blockchain data isn't
[12:01] that useful you could try to measure it
[12:03] by the mining difficulty and the hash
[12:05] power going up but the problem with that
[12:07] is that there can be too much hash power
[12:10] there can be more hash power than the
[12:12] market can bear and so you can have a a
[12:15] correction if too many miners speculate
[12:17] that they can make money mining Bitcoin
[12:19] and so that's not a perfect measure
[12:21] either like it's not just a positive
[12:23] some thing where the more hash power you
[12:25] get the better um and doesn't mean that
[12:27] you can keep it so every kind of way
[12:30] that you could look at Bitcoin and and
[12:31] it statistics there's all these caveats
[12:33] and nuances to it um and I wanted to
[12:36] make a follow-up point to your earlier
[12:38] topic which is that one thing that's
[12:40] hard for bitcoiners to understand or or
[12:42] agree with is that there's no price in
[12:46] Bitcoin like there's no enforcement of
[12:48] the price there's no liquidity in
[12:50] Bitcoin there aren't even actually
[12:52] transactions in Bitcoin there's just you
[12:54] move the Bitcoin to one other address
[12:55] there's no peer-to-peer like you get
[12:58] this I get that there's no trade you
[13:00] know what I mean and so there's no
[13:02] guarantee that Bitcoin you'll be able to
[13:04] sell Bitcoin for the price that you need
[13:06] to sell it for when you need to sell it
[13:08] and so even though we can speculate and
[13:11] say oh it looks like Bitcoin continues
[13:13] to go up and up and up over time
[13:15] especially on the long term that that's
[13:18] just speculation like it could have a
[13:21] fiveyear sideways Behavior or a 10year
[13:25] you know getting getting stuck under
[13:27] $100,000 like you have noidea idea what
[13:29] it's going to do it's all based off of a
[13:32] sentiment of the people that own it and
[13:34] the people that are interested in own it
[13:35] and the actual supply and demand that's
[13:37] the the ultimate free market Bitcoin and
[13:40] it represents it kind of kind of
[13:43] perfectly and it's and it's great to to
[13:45] have that I feel like yeah I mean I
[13:47] don't know that so I think it's a free
[13:50] money and for lack of a better term in
[13:52] other words it's it's a market issued
[13:54] money and so thus it is a good component
[13:57] of a free market but having free markets
[14:00] is very difficult still um we can have
[14:02] to some degree free markets that are
[14:05] digital like where you have like black
[14:07] markets on on uh tour and things like
[14:10] this but in like the real world in meat
[14:13] space like you can't really run a
[14:14] business without being beholden to
[14:17] various laws and regulations and
[14:20] limitations being forced to censor in
[14:22] various ways and so there there's
[14:24] definitely a limit to this as well as to
[14:26] how we how much we can claim we have a
[14:28] free market and that's very much what
[14:29] we're trying to build with the atomic
[14:31] economy idea it's basically saying with
[14:34] all of the current Technologies and
[14:35] things that we could design what would
[14:37] be the optimal free market in digital
[14:40] system that we could have a peer-to-peer
[14:42] open market that's at least in the
[14:44] digital sense it's interesting it's also
[14:47] um like what does it mean to have a free
[14:50] market like like it uh if there's a
[14:53] system that's open but there are still
[14:55] taxes is that a free market like how how
[14:58] would you define free market is one that
[15:00] doesn't require intervention so like if
[15:03] if the government is governing the
[15:05] market it's not free um and so the free
[15:08] market is basically a market so a free
[15:11] market isn't a place without rules a
[15:13] free market is a place where only the
[15:14] people involved agree on the rules and
[15:17] then a white Market is one where you
[15:19] have this third party that's involved in
[15:21] everything and so that's that's the
[15:23] difference and so when you have a black
[15:24] market you and the person you're trading
[15:26] with make the rules um and when you have
[15:29] a white Market the host makes the
[15:31] rules that makes a lot of sense um do
[15:35] you see Bitcoin already as as money for
[15:39] for for that uh black market for that
[15:42] parallel economy is that already there
[15:45] needs to happen needs there to be happen
[15:47] a lot more um it could be better in the
[15:51] sense that while Bitcoin is inherently
[15:54] private on its own in other words
[15:55] there's no metadata about its users in
[15:57] there there's not even financial data
[15:59] right because the amounts are just you
[16:01] don't know what people are doing when
[16:03] they when they make a Bitcoin
[16:04] transaction they could be sending an nft
[16:06] they could be selling a utxo as an
[16:09] exclusive club membership and they just
[16:11] don't tell you how they're using that
[16:13] Bitcoin transaction so there's not a lot
[16:15] that you can infer necessarily it's it's
[16:17] literally just like moving moving things
[16:19] around and you don't know 100% what's
[16:21] going on um let's come to to the scaling
[16:24] part of of of Bitcoin uh as you with I'm
[16:29] also working in in that as I think um
[16:32] how do we scale Bitcoin without losing
[16:35] the decentralization and being aware of
[16:39] the convenience that people seek usually
[16:42] um I will say my my answers are probably
[16:44] different than most people um and not
[16:47] exactly popular but as far as how to
[16:49] scale Bitcoin just there's a few ways to
[16:51] look at it one just by design it
[16:54] literally does not scale in other words
[16:56] every single node has to run do the same
[16:59] amount of work there's no way to gain an
[17:01] efficiency by adding more nodes um so
[17:04] there's no efficiency gains that could
[17:05] be had in scaling with onchain Bitcoin
[17:08] now you can start to make these sort of
[17:11] like pseudo Credit Systems or pseudo
[17:13] Trust Systems or these kind of games on
[17:15] layers like lightning and things like
[17:17] this where you have two people sharing
[17:19] you know a utxo and trying to you know
[17:22] enforce the rules of that um but it's
[17:26] becoming clear that some of these things
[17:28] have lot of limitations and so my idea
[17:31] of scaling is that you have to try to
[17:35] find a sweet spot you have to try to say
[17:37] okay yes any amount of increase in cost
[17:42] is exclusive and any amount of exclusion
[17:44] is centralization and so if the fees for
[17:48] sending a Bitcoin transaction for
[17:49] example keep going up then Bitcoin will
[17:52] keep becoming more centralized because
[17:54] you're you're continually excluding the
[17:56] lower class of users by the higher the
[17:59] price goes up the same is true um if
[18:02] there's the cost to running a node to be
[18:04] able to use Bitcoin in a self- sovereign
[18:06] self- Sovereign way verify the
[18:08] transactions you're receiving a real
[18:09] Bitcoin um if the cost run a node goes
[18:12] up you can be excluded and so what we
[18:14] have to try to do is keep our our finger
[18:18] on the pulse of Technology what are what
[18:20] are the trends and costs in Hardware you
[18:24] know hard drive space uh connectivity
[18:27] how how fast our net works you know what
[18:29] what type of issues are people having
[18:31] with you know downloading data from the
[18:33] blockchain and initial block downloads
[18:35] and this kind of thing propagating data
[18:38] um you know what kind of latency are we
[18:39] having to propagate new blocks across
[18:41] the network and identifying where the
[18:44] safe spots are and so that way when
[18:47] blocks are full for too long we can make
[18:51] good arguments about whether or not to
[18:53] increase block size um and whether there
[18:55] are safe ways to do that without without
[18:57] a hard Fork you know like like we did
[18:59] with segue for example but generally we
[19:03] need any types of changes like this to
[19:05] be Market driven not engineer driven we
[19:07] needed to be where like it's just
[19:09] emergent that everybody is like
[19:12] everybody wants bigger blocks when that
[19:14] when that is the culture of things then
[19:16] you can do it we're nowhere near that
[19:18] right now most people are scared to even
[19:20] talk about the idea never mind actually
[19:23] research how to do it and propose it as
[19:25] a softwork and the blocks aren't full
[19:27] right now anyway so how are you going to
[19:29] convince anyone like it's just silly
[19:32] right the you can't really take risks so
[19:34] I would say you have to I think it's
[19:37] worth you know revisiting the idea of
[19:40] onchain scaling within a sweet spot but
[19:44] knowing that there's a limit to that
[19:46] that eventually we hit a limit or we
[19:47] come too close to limits and we start
[19:50] excluding people because of the cost of
[19:52] running a node or the the latency of the
[19:55] networks Etc and so there's only like a
[19:58] sweet spot we can hit and then we've
[20:00] done the best we can do and we have to
[20:02] wait till technology advances further
[20:04] and even if we get networks to be like
[20:06] the speed of light which would be the
[20:08] ultimate limit that's still a scaling
[20:10] limit there because the distance and the
[20:12] size of the Earth you know what I mean
[20:13] that the time it takes for the speed of
[20:15] light to travel across the Earth there's
[20:17] your your minimum latency for
[20:19] propagating a block so you have a lot of
[20:22] actual technical limitations to scaling
[20:24] but I do think that there's more that
[20:26] could be done in the future with onchain
[20:28] scaling and I also think that there's
[20:31] less reason to be overly confident in
[20:34] layered scaling there's a lot in there
[20:37] uh but layout is layout scaling still
[20:41] part of the solution uh depends how you
[20:43] look at it like for example what
[20:45] lightning does is it incorporates a
[20:47] little bit of trust and a little bit of
[20:49] self- enforcement like you have to
[20:51] defend your channel the Bitcoin
[20:52] blockchain doesn't do it for you um and
[20:55] it trades basically it trades this trust
[20:58] dynamic
[20:59] so you can have now the capability of uh
[21:03] doing many transactions offchain with
[21:05] one direct pier and you can also now
[21:08] indirectly do this with other peers that
[21:10] they're connected to but the main
[21:12] advantage the core advantage of it is
[21:14] simply if you plan to do many
[21:16] transactions with one direct party you
[21:19] know and you know that you're going to
[21:20] do those
[21:21] transactions and you trust them enough
[21:24] to have a lightning Channel with them
[21:26] then you could save a decent amount of
[21:28] money by doing that instead of on chain
[21:31] transactions but there's some C all
[21:33] those caveats in there are true like you
[21:35] can't just say lightning is strictly
[21:37] better um it's cheaper and everybody
[21:39] should use it and there's no trade-offs
[21:40] there's tons of trade-offs there's a lot
[21:42] of complexity there's a lot of there's
[21:43] chances that your channel will close
[21:45] when you don't want it to there's
[21:46] chances that you won't be able to afford
[21:48] the enforcement transaction because when
[21:50] you do have a clo a force close the fees
[21:53] are too high or the fees are higher than
[21:55] the value you have in the channel
[21:57] there's all kinds of weird dynamics that
[21:58] can happen but um I do think lightning
[22:01] will always have a place at minimum with
[22:03] busino business transactions so B2B you
[22:07] know transacting in Bitcoin is something
[22:09] that could be done instead of credit
[22:11] terms in sort of normal normal credit
[22:13] terms where like I buy something from
[22:15] your business and then every 30 days we
[22:17] settle and I actually pay for it you
[22:19] know what I mean instead of doing that
[22:21] you can dynamically settle with
[22:23] lightning and not have to worry about
[22:25] this like delay and so there's these
[22:27] there these Gam means that definitely
[22:29] exchanges will have large businesses
[22:32] that you know accept Bitcoin you know
[22:34] any type of merchant that is significant
[22:36] and doing business in Bitcoin with other
[22:38] businesses will definitely get an
[22:39] advantage out of lightning but that
[22:41] doesn't take us to millions of users you
[22:44] know what I mean that doesn't help us
[22:46] get to billions of users it just helps
[22:49] us have businesses which is probably
[22:52] more like in the thousands or at best
[22:54] tens of thousands that would be involved
[22:57] in this kind of thing it gives them an
[22:59] option so there is some scaling there
[23:01] but it is a trust tradeoff it's not just
[23:04] a pure thing and it's it's interesting
[23:08] how do you look at at smaller
[23:10] transactions of like okay we have that
[23:13] parallel economy and I just want to buy
[23:15] like a very small thing meaning being a
[23:18] coffee or like a small digital thing
[23:20] like something that is very
[23:21] inexpensive
[23:23] um would like those kind of use cases
[23:26] would then make more sense on on layer
[23:29] Technologies of like having because you
[23:32] don't need that much trust and you can
[23:33] park small amounts of of money in that's
[23:36] it that that way I kind of see of like
[23:39] the layer Solutions I have a lightning
[23:41] wallet where I I don't know keep a 100
[23:44] or something like that in there uh to
[23:46] pay every now and then for a restaurant
[23:49] a bill or something like that um not a
[23:52] lot of them accept it but uh those that
[23:55] do it's an really good experience um but
[23:58] it's all custodial and I I I use i w
[24:01] that was my question and and I use
[24:04] wallet of Satoshi for that because I
[24:07] don't uh currently it's like how even if
[24:11] they rock me I don't really care like
[24:13] it's I see it as like my wallet that I
[24:16] have in in my pocket uh someone can come
[24:18] up to me and and steal it and I would
[24:20] probably not even do something because
[24:22] there's nothing valuable in there and
[24:23] like before they they shoot me or put a
[24:27] knife in my gut I just let them take it
[24:30] um but where I never want to have the
[24:33] majority of my money there my majority
[24:35] of money should be on on the main layer
[24:38] so that's why I'm really interested in
[24:39] like um how will we deal with that and
[24:43] as you said like the main layer has
[24:45] limitations um even if we increase the
[24:48] block size there's only like so much we
[24:49] can increase and if we are really like
[24:52] Bitcoin is successful but if if a lot of
[24:55] people use Bitcoin we we probably run
[24:57] into limitations of like doing the big
[25:00] and important transactions on on on
[25:03] chain and maybe then coffee transactions
[25:06] on on on second layers or third layers
[25:08] or whatever we can do well there's some
[25:11] Nuance here I I think that what we found
[25:14] and what I've learned is that when you
[25:17] start getting to really small
[25:18] transactions and really high frequency
[25:21] you end up having to compare all
[25:24] solutions and so for example it's not
[25:27] just whether or not people can use
[25:28] lightning right in other words whether
[25:31] lightning is even cheaper than using
[25:32] onchain Bitcoin it's whether or not
[25:35] making that coffee transaction is easier
[25:37] and cheaper with a credit card or with
[25:39] wallet of Satoshi instead of running
[25:41] your own Lo lightning node you know what
[25:42] I mean these so this is what what these
[25:45] things these Solutions are competing
[25:47] against and right now what we see in the
[25:50] world is that the more quantity the more
[25:53] high frequency the smaller the
[25:55] transaction the more trust is typically
[25:57] involved in the transaction and so if
[26:01] the way to accomplish scale of micro
[26:05] payments is trust then Bitcoin isn't
[26:08] part of that solution right because
[26:10] Bitcoin is meant to be used in a
[26:11] trustless way and so if you're using
[26:13] Bitcoin and trusted
[26:15] situations why like you could use
[26:18] anything um and you could trust with
[26:20] anything why trust with something
[26:21] extremely valuable for example your
[26:23] wallet of Satoshi account why not just
[26:26] give them $50 instead of Bitcoin you
[26:29] know what I mean like if you have $50
[26:31] because that's you're less worried about
[26:33] losing the $50 than you are the Bitcoin
[26:36] um but in the end I think you do need
[26:39] trust to do these things because they
[26:42] they simply can't scale something
[26:44] especially Bitcoin to be used for every
[26:47] day every single tiny little transaction
[26:50] it will just never happen and it won't
[26:52] happen on Lightning either because it's
[26:54] limited by on chain in other words the
[26:57] cost to make a lightning channel the
[26:58] cost to close a lightning Channel what
[27:00] the costs of your lightning Channel
[27:02] closing by mistake the cost of locking
[27:05] up Bitcoin in those channels to provide
[27:07] liquidity to you and what will that
[27:09] eventual market rate be for locking up
[27:11] that Bitcoin and putting it at risk in a
[27:13] hot wallet and then you're comparing all
[27:15] those Dynamics to well I could just use
[27:17] wallet of Satoshi or I could just use my
[27:19] credit card or I could just use my bank
[27:22] and as long as you can still do those
[27:24] things you will and your bank isn't very
[27:26] interested in censoring your cost
[27:28] transactions right they're interested in
[27:30] censoring larger ones or more
[27:32] significant ones for different types of
[27:34] things and so most people most of the
[27:36] time are going to do just fine using
[27:39] trusted solutions for micro payments so
[27:42] do we want Bitcoin for coffee probably
[27:45] not do we want Bitcoin for as many
[27:47] transactions as many as people as
[27:49] possible yes and so another thing to
[27:52] think about is what will people use like
[27:54] I already mentioned they will consider
[27:56] all the solutions and so another thing
[27:58] Nuance in here is let's say they really
[28:01] do want to use Bitcoin they don't want
[28:03] to use bank they don't want to use uh
[28:06] you know a custodial solution what they
[28:09] might find is what you might ask is okay
[28:11] why do they want a blockchain so bad and
[28:13] will those people when they can't afford
[28:15] Bitcoin when Bitcoin doesn't scale to
[28:17] meet their needs will they not just use
[28:19] a worse blockchain and there's and maybe
[28:21] we'll have like a ladder of blockchains
[28:24] where it's like Bitcoin is the top it's
[28:25] the most secure it's the most reliable
[28:27] it's it's the most stable store of value
[28:29] and growing even and then everything
[28:31] below it is like a spectrum of how close
[28:34] does it come to bitcoin security
[28:36] censorship resistance and speculative
[28:39] value it's also like um for for the
[28:43] smaller transactions of like cofes and
[28:46] stuff like that um I mean bitcoiners
[28:49] that kind of live on a Bitcoin standard
[28:51] or like they uh have already income in
[28:55] Bitcoin like myself uh I think Jack m is
[28:58] also famous for for doing that and some
[29:00] others uh they just have a credit card
[29:03] and pay once a month the credit card off
[29:05] with with Bitcoin and and therefore they
[29:07] have like one Bitcoin transaction a
[29:09] month but do the smaller transactions
[29:13] and inact with the feat system right
[29:15] like channel right like they once a
[29:18] month they top it up or they make a
[29:19] channel and then when the channel runs
[29:21] out they top it up again it it's just a
[29:24] method of applying trust to be able to
[29:26] make things more affordable and
[29:29] faster yeah it's an interesting
[29:31] comparison of because it's like not it's
[29:33] not Bitcoin scaling yeah it's not
[29:35] Bitcoin SC I mean I mean in a sense uh
[29:38] you still use you don't really use
[29:40] Bitcoin that that's true like you you um
[29:43] it helps you spend your Bitcoin in an
[29:46] indirect way it's not really scaling
[29:48] it's Bank scaling in the end right like
[29:51] that's that's a tricky part when you
[29:52] have when you get into conversations
[29:53] with bitcoiners about the design of
[29:56] Bitcoin Etc is when you talk about
[29:58] scaling they often like change the
[30:00] definition of what they're scaling to
[30:02] suit the current you know topic and
[30:05] they'll just keep changing the
[30:06] definition like are we talking about
[30:08] scaling on chain are we talking about
[30:10] scaling the amount of people that hold
[30:12] Bitcoin with their own Keys the amount
[30:14] of people that use nodes the amount of
[30:15] people that use lightning the amount of
[30:16] people that use Banks you know at some
[30:19] point you make a leap and you're not
[30:20] talking about Bitcoin anymore
[30:22] right yeah that that's true like uh even
[30:26] even lightning um
[30:28] it's like you if we can build a lot of
[30:32] transactions on Lightning we didn't
[30:35] scale Bitcoin in in a definitional sense
[30:38] we we we allowed more transactions uh on
[30:43] on lightning and we're using Bitcoin so
[30:45] it's it's less it's more about using
[30:48] more about scaling the use case of
[30:50] Bitcoin and less about scaling Bitcoin
[30:52] in itself when we go to the definitions
[30:54] is that what kind going lightning isn't
[30:57] a nice sweet spot out there nice gray
[30:59] area like where at least lightning is
[31:01] made out of Bitcoin transactions right
[31:03] like every lightning transaction is
[31:05] literally a Bitcoin transaction that
[31:07] could be sent on chain if the user
[31:09] wanted to and so it is really Bitcoin
[31:12] it's just all unconfirmed transactions
[31:15] which most people don't consider to be
[31:17] real until they're confirmed right and
[31:20] so this still trust involved there's
[31:22] still uncertainty involved there's still
[31:24] self- enforcement required Etc but it's
[31:28] just that that Dynamic again of using
[31:30] trust to try to accomplish you know more
[31:33] efficient you know use of Bitcoin
[31:35] lightning is an interesting design also
[31:37] Arc as well which is kind of similar um
[31:40] in that it actually uses Bitcoin
[31:42] transactions whereas almost every other
[31:45] layer proposal um for scaling isn't that
[31:48] it's like using a separate blockchain
[31:50] like for example liquid which you know
[31:52] when you when you try to categorize it
[31:54] it isn't that much different than
[31:55] looking at an altcoin it's just saying
[31:57] it's a separate blockchain you convert
[31:59] your Bitcoin into the units of that
[32:01] blockchain and now you trust these
[32:03] middlemen to redeem your bit your real
[32:06] Bitcoin for their blockchain tokens
[32:09] someday and so that's not really scaling
[32:12] either right it's scaling liquid when
[32:14] you use it because every transaction on
[32:16] liquid will never happen on bitcoin
[32:18] let's take a break for a moment and
[32:20] appreciate the beauty that coin
[32:22] vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[32:25] watches those watches are the most aming
[32:27] amazing the most elegent way of showing
[32:30] that you are a true bitcoiner and coin
[32:33] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[32:36] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[32:39] watch collections you have the date of
[32:42] the first ever Min Bitcoin Block in
[32:45] there and of course also the block
[32:47] height and which Epoch we are currently
[32:50] in I love the level of detail they put
[32:53] in in this masterpiece make sure to
[32:56] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[32:59] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[33:01] love those watches so so much and now if
[33:04] you have Bitcoin I really do hope that
[33:07] you don't have it on Exchange but if you
[33:09] do have it on Exchange I have two ways
[33:11] for you to deal with that the first way
[33:14] is you put it on a hardware wallet
[33:16] that's the entry for you to get into the
[33:19] self- custody game I recommend bitbox
[33:22] Bitcoin only Edition for that it's a
[33:25] super simple and secure way and if you
[33:28] check out the link in the description
[33:30] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[33:33] Robin and the second way is the Bitcoin
[33:36] way the Bitcoin way is your Allin
[33:39] partner in terms of how to get the most
[33:42] out of your sovereignty they will
[33:44] personalize for you a self custody setup
[33:47] that is perfect for your individual
[33:50] situation they will show you how you can
[33:53] secure your own devices securing your
[33:55] Bitcoin is not enough you also have to
[33:58] keep all your devices secure one topic
[34:00] that is overlooked often is the
[34:02] inheritance plan what happens with your
[34:05] Bitcoin once you are no longer here do
[34:08] you have a plan for that in place
[34:10] already and last but not least if you're
[34:12] in jurisdictions where you don't feel
[34:15] safe it's better to get a plan B for all
[34:18] that head over to the Bitcoin way.com
[34:22] robobin to get a 30 minute free call and
[34:25] just a quick side note I will will be
[34:28] for the first time ever speaking at the
[34:30] Bitcoin Prague event in June it will be
[34:33] absolutely legendary and I'm really
[34:35] looking forward to seeing all of you
[34:38] there you can get your ticket in the
[34:40] link down in the description of Bitcoin
[34:42] brag and very important use code Robin
[34:45] to get 10% off your ticket I'm really
[34:48] looking forward seeing you there do you
[34:50] think will get a majority of uh of of of
[34:55] people on Earth to to use Bitcoin
[34:59] no um I think you get the majority of
[35:01] per people on Earth to know that it's
[35:03] there and know that it's an option for
[35:05] them if they need it and and as time
[35:07] moves on people will you know get a
[35:09] better understanding a better
[35:10] instinctive understanding of what it's
[35:12] for and when to use it and why but it
[35:15] simply can't be used by everybody and
[35:18] just by like we see how it's playing out
[35:21] you know what I mean we watched that as
[35:22] soon as Bitcoin was invented it caused
[35:25] more monies than ever to exist not L
[35:28] right like Bitcoin hyperbitcoinization
[35:29] didn't happen we got hypers shitcoin
[35:31] iation you know what I mean it just we
[35:33] just got more and more altcoins and so I
[35:36] think that we should look at reality and
[35:38] see how things have scaled how things
[35:43] have you know what where successes have
[35:44] come we saw we see a lot of success with
[35:47] tether and I think there's a lot of
[35:49] reasons for that as well and tether is
[35:51] covering a lot of the kind of areas that
[35:53] some bitcoiners wish Bitcoin would scale
[35:55] into like micro payment
[35:58] you know peer-to-peer Commerce this kind
[35:59] of thing so we we have to accept and we
[36:03] should try to understand why all these
[36:04] things became true not make up stories
[36:07] as to why they shouldn't be true it's
[36:09] like um I mean the the Dilemma of like
[36:13] you you cannot have the most
[36:15] decentralized and robust system and
[36:19] paying uh a coffee with it so like the
[36:23] like you can have one or the other
[36:25] basically and we we can integrate system
[36:27] so the the one system works really fine
[36:30] with the other one but we we cannot
[36:31] really scale uh the the decentralized
[36:35] system to also work in the most uh
[36:38] scaled way possible is that what you're
[36:41] kind of going to yeah like when you're
[36:43] trying to work in distributed systems
[36:45] you're always going to have a limitation
[36:47] for the the overall scope of the system
[36:49] you can't have a global peer-to-peer
[36:52] entirely system like it just doesn't
[36:54] work you end up needing to aggregate and
[36:57] index and coordinate and you have all
[37:00] these different network behaviors that
[37:02] you have to make happen in order for the
[37:04] use cases that people actually use
[37:05] networks for to be possible and you just
[37:08] can't you just can't scale Bitcoin in
[37:10] that way thing yeah um are you
[37:16] um there's a lot of the community that
[37:18] focuses now on on price that focus on
[37:21] like ETF on micro strategy on like black
[37:24] rock on like Bitcoin or shitcoin
[37:27] research of strategy um are we too
[37:30] focused on just the the the price going
[37:34] going up and and and not enough on the
[37:37] actual technology and and actual making
[37:40] Bitcoin a viable money uh maybe um again
[37:44] too much is subjective right so I don't
[37:46] know what is too much in my opinion too
[37:49] many people care too much about that to
[37:51] a degree where they accept a lot a lot
[37:54] of their own ignorance in other words
[37:56] they listen for the things they want to
[37:58] hear and then they learn weird
[38:01] understandings of Bitcoin and they try
[38:02] to build on those weird understandings
[38:04] and they end up having a pretty
[38:06] malformed you know vision of Bitcoin
[38:09] that just only fits the idea of number
[38:12] go up and it's just isn't that simple
[38:14] and it isn't that true so I do think
[38:16] that there's a bit too much focus on
[38:18] that especially the idea of White Market
[38:20] Bitcoin and other words stuff in ETFs
[38:23] stuff involved with the government um
[38:26] these things are are not going to work
[38:28] out well for people because in the end
[38:30] the the true core value of Bitcoin is in
[38:32] censorship resistance and when it comes
[38:35] time to to lever that and use that
[38:38] censorship resistance the government's
[38:40] going to counter and react the opposite
[38:42] way they're not going to be like oh yeah
[38:44] this is great you know we love uh having
[38:47] a strategic Bitcoin Reserve where all
[38:48] the bitcoiners just tell us to off
[38:50] and do what they want like that's not
[38:53] gonna be compatible and they're gonna
[38:55] end up trying to control Bitcoin or you
[38:57] know Define how you can or can't use it
[39:00] trying to make sure everybody every
[39:02] business entity out there is censoring
[39:04] to their liking miners lightning nodes
[39:07] whatever it may be what you know the
[39:09] more successful it becomes the more
[39:11] they'll behave that way and so I think
[39:13] we should be focusing more on how we can
[39:18] avoid that how we can avoid you know
[39:20] government being able to influence
[39:22] bitcoin's protocol influence its design
[39:25] influence how people use it influence
[39:27] the the rights and laws around it um
[39:31] honestly the only political like or
[39:34] White Market Behavior I can justify is
[39:37] fighting for Bitcoin rights um in other
[39:40] words putting it into law that I can
[39:42] have a Bitcoin wallet that I can you
[39:45] know sell anything I want you know sell
[39:48] for Bitcoin instead of for dollars or
[39:51] things that I'm allowed explicitly
[39:54] allowed to do instead of rules about how
[39:57] I can do things you know what I mean or
[39:59] whether I can do things these
[40:01] regulations basically like we don't need
[40:04] more regulations we really don't all of
[40:06] the crimes that have been committed
[40:08] around Securities and finance have been
[40:11] documented and dealt with and the
[40:13] Bitcoin ones aren't that new they're
[40:15] just a combination of existing you know
[40:17] crimes and so we don't need regulatory
[40:20] Clarity what we need is Bitcoin rights I
[40:22] have seen a little bit of that which I
[40:24] like but not nearly enough it's mostly
[40:26] about trying to find ways is to get the
[40:27] government to pump our
[40:29] bags yeah is that maybe even like a
[40:32] threat to bitcoin um if the the
[40:35] community is too focused on that and
[40:37] imple implementing change on bitcoin
[40:40] always requires consensus and PR uh
[40:43] thing of like if we are too focused on
[40:46] that it might uh lead to to something
[40:48] that we don't don't want with with black
[40:50] crog and governments and big
[40:51] institutions get behind that definitely
[40:55] um you know like there's a a bud an
[40:57] invisible budget for every idea and
[41:00] every industry and every you know
[41:03] project and when you're mental budget
[41:06] you know your attention your your actual
[41:09] budget you know how you invest money in
[41:11] startups and businesses and things like
[41:13] this when it starts getting distorted
[41:15] over to Legacy Financial interests
[41:17] political interests you know making
[41:20] politicians interested educating
[41:22] politicians educating you know uh
[41:25] Congress and when you start biasing
[41:27] yourself towards that you're biasing
[41:29] yourself to government dependence and so
[41:32] the more we bias as a culture as our
[41:35] money we become those things and so if
[41:38] we were to have a culture that was more
[41:40] biased towards privacy CIP resistance
[41:44] you know free markets voluntarism you
[41:48] know all these kinds of Concepts then
[41:50] people would be investing in different
[41:52] types of businesses they'd be building
[41:53] different things they'd be you know
[41:55] different types of people working on the
[41:57] protocol and yeah I think our culture
[41:59] will definitely affect what Bitcoin is
[42:01] because Bitcoin is people it's not just
[42:03] some sort of like magical you know law
[42:06] of physics that was invented it's just
[42:08] people running running computers and if
[42:11] those people decide to think differently
[42:13] and behave differently and they do it as
[42:14] a group things will change and so we we
[42:17] do have to be mindful about where we put
[42:19] our kind of mental and financial
[42:23] budgets very true absolutely um uh
[42:28] fun one do you is is a KC Bitcoin the
[42:32] same as a non KC Bitcoin depends who you
[42:34] ask right like Bitcoin doesn't decide
[42:37] the cool thing about Bitcoin is because
[42:39] it being sensor persistance it doesn't
[42:41] decide what's okay right but your
[42:44] counterparty has every right to decide
[42:46] what's okay in other words Bitcoin is
[42:48] perfect for a free market and when we
[42:50] Define free markets earlier it's just
[42:52] when you and your counterparty agree on
[42:54] the rules well if your counterparty says
[42:56] you have to show me your ID in order to
[42:59] pay in Bitcoin then that's the only way
[43:01] you're going to do business with that
[43:02] part counterparty whether he says it
[43:04] because the government told him to or
[43:06] because he needs that information to
[43:08] feel like he can trust you and so you
[43:11] know you can't stop that your
[43:14] counterparty can censor you or deny
[43:16] doing business with you and if you
[43:19] become somebody that nobody wants to do
[43:20] business with for some reason other than
[43:22] the government said then nobody will do
[43:24] business with you regardless of your
[43:26] Bitcoin so
[43:28] yeah I do hope that that non KC Bitcoin
[43:33] are are allowed in the wide Market than
[43:36] in the future but it seems like now it
[43:38] seems like they they mostly can um you
[43:41] do have like some people getting flagged
[43:43] when they're doing coin joins or when
[43:46] you know when you are touching an an
[43:48] ofac listed address like there are
[43:51] there's still some kind of censorship
[43:52] and things that get flagged in that way
[43:55] but for the most part there's not a lot
[43:57] of like really angling out anything
[44:01] that's not White Market Bitcoin um it's
[44:03] getting worse though things like the
[44:05] flight Rule MAA regulations these kinds
[44:07] of things get get us closer and closer
[44:10] and closer to White Market being Bitcoin
[44:13] being the only sanctioned Bitcoin and
[44:15] black market being portrayed as criminal
[44:18] um and remember Black Market doesn't
[44:20] mean criminal it just means not
[44:23] following the law and so just because
[44:26] you don't consider the regulations or
[44:28] laws when you use Bitcoin doesn't
[44:30] necessarily mean that you're doing
[44:32] something bad it doesn't even mean
[44:33] you're breaking the law it just means
[44:35] you're doing it without consulting the
[44:37] law without worrying about or
[44:39] considering the law yeah there's this uh
[44:41] difference between doing the right thing
[44:44] and doing the legal thing like there is
[44:47] yeah there often is a big
[44:49] difference does doesn't doesn't need to
[44:52] be the the same thing I shouldn't be too
[44:54] negative like all of that said like most
[44:56] laws exist for good reasons most of our
[44:59] most of the intent of humanity to get
[45:01] other humans to behave is a natural and
[45:05] organic and and meaningful or moral
[45:08] intent but we do get lost in this all
[45:11] this negotiating of telling other people
[45:12] what they should or shouldn't do yeah
[45:15] and and I get really frustrated when
[45:18] people try to explain like oh like we we
[45:22] we have to do it that way because that's
[45:25] the law and I'm like okay but
[45:27] why not go to First principles and ask
[45:29] ourself it's that the is that the right
[45:32] thing to do like is is is is that a good
[45:35] thing to do well it depends on the
[45:36] context right like if it's just a
[45:37] personal thing between two people you're
[45:40] a little more free to get away with just
[45:42] making your own rules but when you're a
[45:44] business you don't have as much freedom
[45:46] because now you have more scrutiny you
[45:48] have more reporting depending on the
[45:50] country you're in it will you know make
[45:52] could be worse or better but in the end
[45:54] like as a business you have a physical
[45:56] location they can find you they can hold
[45:58] you accountable they can hold all of
[46:00] your shareholders accountable and so you
[46:02] become more part of the state the bigger
[46:05] your business is the more money your
[46:06] business makes you know these kinds of
[46:08] things yeah you kind of have to be uh
[46:12] aware of where you start your
[46:14] business could make a different it's a
[46:17] big thing now I don't think there's any
[46:19] startup anymore that at least well
[46:22] American mens tend to be American
[46:23] Centric and they're just default to
[46:25] opening their startup in America but
[46:27] startups outside of the US definitely
[46:30] are like think you know asking their
[46:32] lawyer where should we form this
[46:33] business and because most of these
[46:35] businesses are like mostly remote or
[46:37] totally remote and so they can operate
[46:40] out of anywhere and yes for the most
[46:43] part many Bitcoin and crypto uh
[46:46] businesses are strategically choosing
[46:48] where to register their business based
[46:50] on
[46:51] regulations where would you open a
[46:53] Bitcoin business currently do you have
[46:55] like favorite locations where you look
[46:57] for that no I'll say that it's not my
[47:00] job to strategize and worry about that
[47:02] it's lawyers jobs and our lawyers uh
[47:06] initially had us in British Virgin
[47:08] Islands BVI um and recently moved us to
[47:11] El Salvador so yeah welcome
[47:16] to I mean we we don't work from there
[47:19] but yes our business is based out of
[47:20] there and just so the audience
[47:23] understands um our conon our our company
[47:26] synonym is uh majority owned by tether
[47:30] and so tether you know has been working
[47:32] more with El Salvador and is moving some
[47:34] of their companies to El Salvador so
[47:36] it's part of a wider strategic choice I
[47:38] think so I wasn't really too involved
[47:41] within it and I and I don't really care
[47:43] where the business is located as long as
[47:44] it's you know not worse than where we
[47:47] were before um so yeah I I I think it's
[47:50] interesting and I hope it'll turn into
[47:52] something you know of a benefit for us
[47:54] at some point really cool how do you
[47:57] look at uh El Salvador uh where you're
[48:00] already visiting uh yourself also I've
[48:03] been there three times all three to
[48:05] speak at conferences um I hadn't been
[48:08] there in two years until recently I went
[48:10] in January for the plan B conference
[48:13] um I I was I I was in Bitcoin through
[48:16] the whole thing right like I remember
[48:18] when you know Jack MERS went on stage
[48:20] announcing that El Salvador was making
[48:22] it Illegal Tender it was just like one
[48:23] of the biggest news moments for
[48:25] bitcoiners
[48:27] um you know for bitcoiners that you know
[48:30] have Bitcoin ethos you could say it was
[48:32] a big moment you know like a lot of
[48:34] people were really proud of that and
[48:36] really happy to see that happening um I
[48:38] think as it played out we saw that you
[48:41] know El Salvador's Bitcoin appetite was
[48:44] bigger than they could actually digest
[48:47] and so getting you know adoption through
[48:50] getting Cho working getting Merchants to
[48:52] use it getting Bitcoin off the ground
[48:54] there it looked like it was going to
[48:57] hold for a while but it kind of slipped
[48:59] and now with the IMF dealings it looks
[49:01] like it's going to totally slip um so I
[49:04] don't really know what the future of
[49:06] Bitcoin is in El Salvador I think there
[49:07] is still a special future there for it
[49:10] but it's obviously been dampened by
[49:13] their need for money from I mean it
[49:16] probably takes like they they Tred it
[49:17] from Top town and Bitcoin is not uh uh
[49:21] not made for that I I feel like it's
[49:23] like a Grassroots movement uh and need
[49:26] to be more extreme though like they
[49:28] would have had to like not use dollars
[49:30] and say use Bitcoin or have some sort of
[49:33] more much deeper plan for integrating it
[49:36] into the system and making it more
[49:38] natural but I don't it's too much work
[49:41] it's too hard a government is like not
[49:43] really good at anything you know like
[49:45] they're not agile they're not
[49:46] intelligent well they're not they're not
[49:49] agile let's just put it that way and so
[49:51] pulling something like this off was was
[49:53] destined to be unlikely and then they
[49:56] doubled down you know they wanted to do
[49:58] Bitcoin City and volcano Mining and they
[50:00] were just going to do all the dreams
[50:03] obviously they were never going to live
[50:04] up to that scope and so they had to they
[50:07] had to pull back um and now with the IMF
[50:09] stuff I think it's just even worse so I
[50:11] think there'll still be conferences
[50:13] there I think this still be Bitcoin
[50:14] Beach communities and this kind of thing
[50:16] there I just think it's going to be a
[50:17] much longer term you know adoption and
[50:20] interest but the the IMF uh from what
[50:24] IOD was basically
[50:27] they they don't enforce it anymore or is
[50:30] there more to that deal like they what I
[50:33] understand like they they don't enforce
[50:35] that Bitcoin is accepted anymore which
[50:39] for my understanding they never really
[50:41] did I mean they had the law but like
[50:44] most don't have accept it anyways did
[50:47] you see the latest news today or
[50:49] yesterday with the oh no probably not so
[50:53] in general what the IMF was trying to do
[50:55] with defining the deal was as politely
[50:59] and as as gray you know gray area worded
[51:03] as possible tell El Salvador that they
[51:06] just can't do Bitcoin stuff anymore in
[51:08] other words don't they they don't want
[51:09] them to be having a Cho you know trying
[51:12] to get people to adopt it they don't
[51:14] want to have them tweeting about how
[51:16] great it is and and buying it and
[51:19] tweeting all of their Bitcoin buys they
[51:21] would just what they were trying to do
[51:22] is get all of that to stop they don't
[51:24] want a country supporting coin that way
[51:27] and especially one that they can hold
[51:29] leverage over with their loaning and
[51:31] such and so the most recent update that
[51:34] came out to the requirements is they're
[51:36] explicitly telling them to stop buying
[51:38] Bitcoin um and so initially it was more
[51:42] I think they just wanted to get rid of
[51:43] the legal tender aspect because I think
[51:46] that was causing some complications in
[51:48] other conversations about what legal
[51:51] tender is and whether Bitcoin you know
[51:53] is money whether it should be taxed you
[51:55] know these kinds of things
[51:57] um and they didn't want to have you know
[51:59] that example out in the wild and so they
[52:00] wanted to squash that and now that they
[52:03] say that that that didn't stop El
[52:05] Salvador from being you know a Bitcoin
[52:08] evangelist they want to also stop the
[52:11] Bitcoin buying and they're trying
[52:13] they're telling El Salvador that
[52:14] basically to continue to get the loan
[52:15] payments they have to be make the only
[52:18] way that they acquire Bitcoin be through
[52:20] confiscation in legal matters in other
[52:22] words when somebody is a hacker gets
[52:24] caught or a thief gets caught whatever
[52:27] then they can have that they can hold
[52:28] that Bitcoin but they can't buy it
[52:30] anymore it's fun when uh America buys it
[52:33] but then the IMF
[52:35] tells well America hasn't bought it yet
[52:38] technically um so the IMF might not be
[52:41] happy with them either I don't really
[52:42] know the Dynamics between us and IMF but
[52:45] the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve doesn't
[52:47] exist yet it's just uh it's just a pump
[52:50] narrative at the moment it's like the
[52:52] opposite of like when China China bans
[52:54] Bitcoin it's like Trump buys Bitcoin
[52:57] like no like we we just saw they
[52:59] announced it they botched the
[53:01] announcement and then it it with totally
[53:04] Rec you know went back to the lower
[53:05] price again so it was just a total
[53:07] speculative move and we don't know maybe
[53:10] Trump and some people around him are
[53:12] interested in manipulating the Bitcoin
[53:14] price and not don't really care too much
[53:16] about you know making it an American you
[53:20] know dream in the the crypto capital of
[53:23] the world you know I just um uh because
[53:27] I think I saw it on on on on the feet
[53:29] and I want to pull it but pull it up
[53:31] because maybe you have more information
[53:33] on on that because uh is that Na's
[53:36] reaction to to to the IMF of like
[53:41] because now 16 hours ago literally he
[53:44] posted that was right before that was
[53:46] right before the IMF announcements so oh
[53:49] that was right before interesting it
[53:50] either came out last night or this
[53:52] morning where they were where the
[53:53] details came out I think it was today
[53:55] actually um but I wasn't following it
[53:57] closely enough to see when it actually
[53:59] was released but everybody's talking
[54:00] about it right now on X interesting
[54:03] interesting yeah um in ever since I have
[54:08] the the podcast I get my news from from
[54:10] the guests more more or less uh which is
[54:14] uh yeah
[54:18] calming my news at this point it's like
[54:20] I wake up in the morning and read my
[54:21] newspaper which is just basically
[54:22] reading my feed yeah it's it's
[54:24] definitely better than newspaper
[54:27] I I I also do that but I try to get off
[54:32] as much as as possible but yeah that
[54:34] that's super interesting uh when when we
[54:36] have a Salvador they they basically try
[54:38] to escape that that that Fiat system but
[54:43] it it's it's hard they they have a lot
[54:47] of um mechanisms to to capture salvad
[54:51] salv still has the dollar like they they
[54:53] still transact with the dollar almost
[54:55] every actions uh the most the most
[54:58] volume and the most transactions from
[55:00] Salvador is in in US Dollars and I was
[55:02] there in November uh where the law that
[55:05] they have to enforce Bitcoin was still
[55:08] there and I couldn't pay a lot with
[55:12] Bitcoin mostly just around the
[55:13] conferences but if you go outside and
[55:15] just go on your own and go somewhere
[55:17] they don't accept it and uh it's funny I
[55:21] I went to the volcano in s Salvador and
[55:24] I was like hey can I pay Bitcoin here
[55:25] and they're like no you can only pay
[55:27] with physical cash and I was like I
[55:28] don't have physical cash and they're
[55:29] like ah you can just go in there for
[55:31] free and I was like it was the entry fee
[55:33] for like $2 and I was like okay but can
[55:35] I gift you Bitcoins like I still want to
[55:38] pay you they're like no like you don't
[55:41] give it even take it as a gift uh but
[55:44] yeah like there's a lot of work to be
[55:46] done if you really want to be in a
[55:48] Bitcoin standard it probably takes way
[55:49] longer than anyone
[55:51] anticipated I don't think there's any
[55:53] reason to force it you know I think that
[55:55] like I said earlier like all they I
[55:57] think that making it legal tender was
[55:59] good they were giving people a right
[56:00] they were saying you know I think the
[56:02] way legal tender works as a concept is
[56:04] it just means that if you make a
[56:06] contract with someone that you are
[56:08] forced to accept Bitcoin as one of the
[56:10] payment methods um and so you know when
[56:13] you when you're at a merchant buying a
[56:14] coffee it's an implied contract but for
[56:17] real for real contracts it's interesting
[56:20] to say okay if I want to denominate this
[56:22] contract in Bitcoin I can and nobody can
[56:24] stop me um
[56:26] yeah I I think it was nice to have that
[56:28] gain but in the end like it didn't play
[56:31] out I would say it's easy as a bitcoiner
[56:34] to be unhappy and say oh this narrative
[56:37] is not there to pump my bags the way it
[56:38] used to be um or the dream of a country
[56:42] you know being on the Bitcoin standard
[56:44] is not working out but I also think we
[56:47] have to be reasonable and think the odds
[56:49] are pretty high that BK made a rational
[56:51] decision you know what I mean he
[56:53] probably looked at it and said well I
[56:55] can be I can make all of Bitcoin Twitter
[56:58] happy or I can make all of the El
[57:00] Salvadorian people have a better life
[57:02] and he probably made the decision he
[57:04] thought was best you know in All Odds
[57:07] it's just that bitcoiners are
[57:08] disappointed with that and that's life
[57:10] you know like I I think the odds are
[57:12] pretty high that that was the best
[57:14] option for him in El Salvador and that's
[57:17] that's the way it's going to be um I
[57:19] don't know maybe he could have gotten
[57:20] the money from tether or something and
[57:24] but what is what options you know if he
[57:27] has Grand plans for his country and he
[57:28] really wants to turn it around and make
[57:30] it into a relevant thing and increase
[57:33] the the standard of living for for all
[57:35] of his people maybe the IMF deal was the
[57:38] best option you know I I think people
[57:41] also they they assumed it's like all
[57:44] like they are now doing legal tender
[57:46] they're buying Bitcoin there will be a
[57:48] Bitcoin country in five years uh like
[57:50] even without the IMF news that takes way
[57:53] longer like even if the IMF deal wasn't
[57:55] there at all it's it's still reality
[57:58] that most people don't transact in in in
[58:01] Bitcoin in El Salvador today and also
[58:04] not in November or December so things
[58:07] things take longer than than than the
[58:10] hype R things like the Bitcoin City plan
[58:14] they had like that's something you talk
[58:15] about doing over decades not five years
[58:18] you know absolutely um I have one
[58:20] question that I ask each and every one
[58:22] of my guests and the question is what
[58:23] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin
[58:26] depends on the topic um I I've lived a
[58:29] uh interesting and very varied life so
[58:33] I've been uh various types of designer
[58:36] illustrator artist I've been uh in the
[58:39] music industry I used to run a record
[58:40] label I was in a punk band um I am very
[58:45] interested in topics related to bitcoin
[58:47] like the actual economics of how it
[58:50] works um yeah I mean I I can talk on a
[58:54] lot of topics but I try to avoid you
[58:56] know talking too much about topics I
[58:58] don't have a lot of experience in so
[59:00] yeah I would say you know I'm happy to
[59:03] to explain anything that I any
[59:05] experience that I have or anything that
[59:06] I've learned um on other in other areas
[59:10] but probably design or like you know
[59:14] peer-to-peer system architecture these
[59:16] things with that my current biggest
[59:18] interests um yeah I don't know I've been
[59:21] using AI a lot I'm working on a side
[59:25] project making uh using AI to make
[59:28] different kinds of fashion um so yeah
[59:31] just random things AI is a game changer
[59:35] it's like the the podcast wouldn't even
[59:37] be here without it at this
[59:40] point um there are three different
[59:42] things the first thing uh is just a
[59:45] research of the guest um I before I used
[59:48] AI I I I needed like 20 25 minutes to to
[59:54] figure out what the guest is about like
[59:55] just just like watching a little bit of
[59:57] video like doing those things um now I
[60:00] have a process where basically in in in
[60:02] like five to 15 minutes um I get like
[60:07] two three EXT information about the
[60:09] guest so I just put it in jbd have a a
[60:13] custom gdbd and I put in transcripts of
[60:18] recent video podcast he has done uh and
[60:21] it's literally just takes me 3 four
[60:23] minutes to gather the data and put it in
[60:25] the custom G
[60:26] and then I get um basically oneid of
[60:31] like okay those interesting topics he
[60:33] usually touches on those are his five
[60:36] most controversial topics uh that he
[60:38] usually talks those are five interesting
[60:40] question that he really talks about but
[60:42] could be interesting to talk about so uh
[60:45] just like um uh figuring out in what
[60:49] direction it might go uh and it dur my
[60:54] time of preparing for podcast from like
[60:56] half an hour to like now like 10 maybe
[60:59] 15 minutes depending on the guest uh I
[61:02] take for for doing that then uh with
[61:05] recording it uh it's in Riverside they
[61:08] do transcript they do summaries they do
[61:10] the the timestamps and all those things
[61:12] um automatically so I just like have to
[61:15] copy and paste it uh and and then in
[61:18] post- production uh now I have two
[61:21] employees that do the post production
[61:23] but uh like a week ago l actually I did
[61:26] it myself still uh and there I I use uh
[61:30] AI to figure out okay what are
[61:32] interesting sound bites of the podcast
[61:34] to put a trailer in front of or like a
[61:37] introduction in front of the podcast to
[61:38] make it more interesting uh even for
[61:41] thumbnail and title design I have custom
[61:43] gbds of like okay here's the
[61:46] introduction here's the transcript what
[61:48] could be an interesting thumbnail give
[61:50] me five variations just to get some
[61:52] ideas going uh and there are many more
[61:55] small ways where I use it um but I think
[61:58] those are like the bigger ones and I
[62:01] said it that without it it wouldn't be
[62:04] the podcast possible because I do I did
[62:06] a daily Bitcoin podcast like every day
[62:09] an interview like that with a different
[62:10] person uh and just TimeWise it wouldn't
[62:13] have been possible because I was alone
[62:15] and there was no post production and
[62:16] there's like clips and all the things
[62:18] that you have to do uh so now ai was
[62:21] making me way more efficient so I could
[62:23] actually do it in the time needed uh to
[62:26] do that uh otherwise I probably only
[62:28] could have done maybe three or four
[62:29] podcasts or maybe five if could but
[62:32] definitely not seven with a San mind
[62:35] also making the quality good no that's
[62:38] interesting it it sounds exactly like
[62:40] what you should be doing you know like
[62:43] uh I'm using AI pretty much every and to
[62:45] use it to do things like make a like for
[62:47] you like a script of questions based off
[62:49] of a bunch of data and based off of a
[62:51] specific context like that's that's
[62:53] really interesting I I feel bad for
[62:56] people that aren't using AI um because
[62:58] it's just like you're it's already at a
[63:01] stage where you're not really
[63:02] competitive if you're not using it and
[63:04] it definitely like can be an unlocker
[63:07] you know like when there when you have a
[63:08] Blocker on something like you don't want
[63:10] to write that blog post or you don't
[63:12] want to edit that video or you just
[63:15] don't want to have to figure something
[63:17] out you don't want to read that white
[63:18] paper whatever it may be like you can
[63:21] you can make your your job much more
[63:23] digestible um one interesting thing
[63:26] lately I realized is I don't remember
[63:28] it's I think brandolini's principle um
[63:31] the one where it takes 10 times more
[63:34] work to refute than to create
[63:36] it and I pointed out to uh Eric voso
[63:39] last week that that's not true anymore
[63:42] because with AI we can refute
[63:44] with AI so I can just take the whole
[63:45] conversation put it in the AI and say
[63:48] write a reply to this guy and refute
[63:49] everything stupid he said and then it
[63:51] will write it for me and then now he has
[63:53] to read my and so it's a nice
[63:56]  defense system um and and I and
[63:59] I've been using it that way too go I
[64:02] have something uh that I I when
[64:05] something in a software that I use I
[64:07] don't like or like there's a bug that
[64:10] that costs me money or time uh I was
[64:13] always too lazy to write a complaint
[64:15] email now I have jet gbd and say like
[64:18] hey this spck happened because of that I
[64:20] have a delay uh and I just like hey
[64:23] write a long email one that ask for a
[64:26] refund uh and actually I have a really
[64:30] high rate of getting a small refund
[64:31] usually not the full one of course but
[64:34] like a small one and it's just like
[64:36] giving a small task literally takes like
[64:38] one minute to put it in jity get the
[64:40] output send the email and then like five
[64:44] hours later oh sorry that that happened
[64:46] here $20 of refund and I'm like that
[64:49] cost me like a minute to do and it's a
[64:53] small refund I mean it's not a not I'm
[64:56] not making money with that but uh just a
[64:59] just a sheer of Mount of like you can
[65:01] put something in and it makes things for
[65:02] you also like responding to emails I um
[65:07] I caught myself using it more and more
[65:10] of of like I just put in the email put
[65:14] it in my my folder of of email responses
[65:17] that I have uh and then let the response
[65:20] be generated and and put the response
[65:23] there and just read over it and usually
[65:25] I change a little bit but also put the
[65:27] change in there so they learn from it uh
[65:30] and lately I I don't change a lot like
[65:33] they they nail how I write email like
[65:35] jgd nails how I write emails and yeah it
[65:39] sounds good like I I wouldn't change a
[65:41] word and just send it I was like that
[65:43] email was completely written by jbd and
[65:46] it's good it's probably better than me
[65:49] one thing I do it with it is like I'll
[65:51] ask I'll use AI to either make what I've
[65:53] written sound more or less like me and
[65:57] so like I I I've spent some time with
[65:59] like with it explaining like how I write
[66:01] what I like about how I write this kind
[66:03] of thing but also I know that I can be
[66:06] you know a little aggressive or
[66:09] offensive to people so once in a while
[66:11] when I'm like okay I I really want to
[66:13] say all this but I don't want to offend
[66:15] this person I'll say you know say this
[66:18] in a simpler way and be more
[66:20] professional and polite and then I'll
[66:21] have it rewrite what I was goingon to
[66:23] say or the opposite I'll say you know I
[66:25] really want to like take down something
[66:27] or like you know make an idea totally
[66:30] refute an idea and dunk on it and kill
[66:32] it and I'll be and I'll and I'll have it
[66:34] help me write something and I'll be like
[66:35] this is just not me enough it needs to
[66:38] be more witty more cutting more
[66:40] surgically precise like and then I'll
[66:43] have it rewrite it until oh gosh that's
[66:45] so funny uh literally today I I did the
[66:48] same thing uh the landlord of
[66:51] mine hope he doesn't watch but maybe he
[66:54] watches uh he he sent me in a text
[66:58] WhatsApp message and I was like oh that
[67:00] that that that really get gets me going
[67:03] like it really it made me angry and then
[67:06] I was writing all the things and like ah
[67:08] it's probably not a good idea to send it
[67:10] like
[67:10] that I took the text put it in chat and
[67:13] said like make it friendly and a little
[67:16] bit more professional so he doesn't kick
[67:17] me out
[67:19] tomorrow uh and and it's like oh yeah it
[67:22] actually reads nice like it's almost
[67:23] like a compliment it says the same thing
[67:25] thing but it almost complement the other
[67:28] one so and it's I do feel bad for the PE
[67:32] like the same way with Bitcoin I do feel
[67:34] bad for people that don't use uh Bitcoin
[67:36] or AI on all those great technologies
[67:39] that enhance your life so great like I
[67:43] like why don't you do that it doesn't
[67:46] matter what you do if you're a designer
[67:47] an artist a
[67:49] programmer uh a business developer
[67:52] whatever you do there's some way the AI
[67:54] could be enhancing what doing and and
[67:56] you kind of have to now because there
[67:57] are other people that are doing that and
[67:59] you won't be able to compete yeah and
[68:01] some people still argue if if it's a
[68:03] good thing or not a good thing and other
[68:05] people just use it to uh um make make
[68:09] life easier really cool thank you so
[68:11] much um we have end routine in the
[68:13] podcast where the previous guest is
[68:14] asking a question for the next guest
[68:16] without knowing who the next guest
[68:17] actually is um the question from the
[68:19] previous guest is uh one that actually
[68:21] came I think like two three times
[68:23] already for the tin question
[68:26] um if you couldn't if if you couldn't
[68:28] invest in Bitcoin or in a Bitcoin
[68:30] related asset or company where would you
[68:33] invest
[68:34] in probably a startup um I would
[68:37] probably start another business and you
[68:40] know try to leverage whatever savings I
[68:42] had that way to make profit by producing
[68:45] something that's probably more risky
[68:48] than uh then my answer should be but
[68:51] that's the first thing that comes to
[68:52] mind is yeah i' probably just take the
[68:54] money and invest it into to a business
[68:56] venture um otherwise maybe some real
[68:58] estate just because I don't own any
[69:00] property right now and it's been a
[69:02] relatively practical safe way to you
[69:05] know store your value for a long time
[69:07] absolutely and RK is going up um only if
[69:11] you denominate in Bitcoin then it's
[69:13] crashing
[69:15] down really cool thank you so much John
[69:17] for for for being uh on my podcast
[69:20] before I let you go where can people
[69:21] find you ask your questions and reach
[69:22] out to you sure yeah I'll just take a
[69:25] quick minute to because we didn't talk
[69:27] too much about our products and business
[69:29] so I'll just mention a couple of those
[69:31] um so the name of the company is synonym
[69:33] um if you want to learn about the
[69:34] company or what jobs we have open that
[69:36] kind of thing you can go to
[69:38] synonym.to do2 um we also have a mobile
[69:43] app called bitkit which is onchain
[69:46] Bitcoin and lightning it has a lightning
[69:48] node in the app so it's all entirely
[69:51] self- custodial um you can learn more
[69:54] about that at bitkit . to um we also
[69:57] have block tank uh which is block
[70:00] tank.to which is a place where you can
[70:02] buy lightning channels and it also
[70:04] Powers the lightning Channel purchases
[70:05] in bit kit um and then finally we have
[70:08] Pub Key which is kind of two aspects to
[70:11] that Pub Key protocol Pub Key core um
[70:14] and then the pub key app uh this is
[70:16] basically a new web protocol that we
[70:19] made where you can use Keys as a domain
[70:21] name like public keys and then from that
[70:24] derivative now you don't don't have to
[70:26] be censored or trusting I can in regular
[70:29] DNS you can use DNS that's based off of
[70:32] your own key and using a the largest
[70:35] most essentialized Network in the world
[70:37] to resolve that key to a website or or
[70:40] location in the internet um Mainline DHT
[70:43] which is the network that powers
[70:45] Torrance um and so we basically store
[70:47] your key signed DNS records in there um
[70:52] so if you're interested in building in
[70:53] peer-to-peer web Tech you can check
[70:55] pubkey core um that's at Pub key.org um
[70:59] and then at Pub key. apppp you can see a
[71:01] preview of an app that we're building to
[71:03] kind of interface with this whole new
[71:05] web Paradigm um and all of these things
[71:08] are kind of uh it works in progress that
[71:12] we intend to all integrate with each
[71:14] other to create this kind of atomic
[71:16] economy that we described earlier um and
[71:18] if you want to find me um I'm Bitcoin
[71:21] error log on Twitter and on telegram um
[71:25] and I do many interviews and say many
[71:28] provocative things if you're
[71:30] interested ah I think you'll say really
[71:32] reasonable things honestly it's I think
[71:35] so too but some people
[71:37] don't uh maybe I think on Twitter it's
[71:40] it's people like
[71:43] to be aggressive more it's like this
[71:46] meme of like two people on on Twitter
[71:48] they're like and then like in real life
[71:50] they're like puppies to each other uh so
[71:53] I I think it's it's more about Twitter
[71:56] and less about you yeah I think that
[71:59] social media really is like a
[72:01] Marketplace of ideas and they're all
[72:02] competing and being mutated by people so
[72:05] people get you know defensive and
[72:07] aggressive because every little thing is
[72:09] competing with every little thing and so
[72:11] it's it's just a real dopamine hit and
[72:14] everybody's just stuck there absolutely
[72:17] by the way but on py when you talked
[72:20] about I always have to think about the
[72:22] bar in New York City I never was there
[72:24] but uh I really want to go there someday
[72:27] yeah really cool um thank you so much
[72:30] John for being on also thank you so much
[72:31] for everyone that is watching and
[72:32] listening for joining us today as always
[72:35] I'll be back tomorrow with another
[72:36] episode bye-bye
[72:38] [Music]
