[00:00] But these people who are using Bitcoin
[00:02] to undermine authoritarianism, some of
[00:04] these other countries that are
[00:05] undergoing hyperinflation, they really
[00:08] need Bitcoin and you could wake up as
[00:10] them tomorrow. You probably want to wake
[00:12] up in the Bitcoin world. One of the
[00:13] reasons that we launched the Bitcoin
[00:15] Research Institute was as a an
[00:17] understanding of this phenomenon that
[00:19] there just aren't enough academics that
[00:21] are interested in Bitcoin. And despite
[00:24] being what now 70% or so of the market
[00:27] cap of all of crypto, we wonder whether
[00:29] maybe Satoshi looked at things like the
[00:31] World Cup and the Olympics and US
[00:33] presidential elections. If a having
[00:35] comes around every four years, people
[00:37] are going to be talking about it in the
[00:39] leadup to it. It's going to drive
[00:40] interest and and Bitcoin is going to
[00:42] have these cycles of interest that
[00:43] follow the having cycles. Kind of like,
[00:46] you know, I'm not watching any swimming
[00:47] right now, but when the Olympics comes
[00:49] around, I'm going to watch swimming. It
[00:51] only happens every four years. And it's
[00:52] interesting. That's sort of the
[00:54] philosophical framework that we suggest
[00:56] people use when they're thinking through
[00:58] Bitcoin and then go through all these
[00:59] steps. How does Bitcoin's monetary
[01:01] policy affect all these people? How does
[01:02] the privacy affect all these people?
[01:06] [Music]
[01:08] For the few people that don't know you,
[01:10] give us some background who you are and
[01:12] and why you're excited about uh Bitcoin.
[01:15] Sure. I'm Bradley Rutler. I teach
[01:18] philosophy at the University of Wyoming
[01:21] and as of July I will be the inaugural
[01:25] director of the Bitcoin Research
[01:27] Institute here. Um, and I also wrote a
[01:30] book with two co-authors, Resistance
[01:34] Money, A Philosophical Case for Bitcoin,
[01:37] which is a academic book, but is
[01:39] designed to be able to be accessible to
[01:42] anyone who who's interested in some of
[01:44] the philosophical issues related to
[01:46] Bitcoin and a philosophical framework to
[01:49] think it through. I'm also a senior
[01:51] fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute.
[01:54] And I mean, I think the thing that
[01:57] excites me about Bitcoin is the same
[01:59] thing that excited me about Bitcoin when
[02:00] I first heard about it um over a decade
[02:03] ago, which is just the potential of
[02:06] Bitcoin to remove middlemen in things
[02:10] like international remittances where
[02:12] Western Union and MoneyGram are are
[02:13] taking percentages or in
[02:16] over-the-counter transactions
[02:18] uh where credit card companies and
[02:20] payment processors are taking
[02:22] percentages and to even remove uh people
[02:25] playing other roles in in the monetary
[02:27] system like creating money and
[02:29] distributing it in whatever way they see
[02:31] fit and holding on to your money for you
[02:35] and and granting you access to it at
[02:38] their their whims. So I see Bitcoin as
[02:40] allowing people to take back the power
[02:43] that that has been grabbed by a lot of
[02:46] people in
[02:47] the related to or adjacent to money.
[02:51] interesting and and there that the
[02:53] resistant money term also is coming from
[02:56] uh from your book I guess. Yeah. Yeah,
[02:58] that's right. So, uh, the case in the
[03:01] book is that Bitcoin is primarily
[03:03] valuable, um, to people who don't have
[03:05] access to better money. And sometimes
[03:07] that's because the monetary rule that
[03:10] they live under is uh, corrupt. And
[03:14] Bitcoin allows you to resist that
[03:15] corruption. And sometimes it's just
[03:18] incompetent. And, uh, you don't have to
[03:21] trust people who you think are
[03:23] incompetent. Uh, you have this
[03:24] alternative. And if you think that your
[03:26] money uh is better than Bitcoin, then
[03:28] you can choose that and you don't have
[03:29] to get involved with Bitcoin. You don't
[03:31] have to use it or or hold any of it. Um
[03:34] but it is there as an option for people
[03:36] who think that it's better. And so
[03:38] because it's optin and allows you these
[03:40] different choices. Um it's good that
[03:43] it's super interesting that um and I I
[03:46] have the same conclusion that Bitcoin is
[03:48] best for the people that need it the
[03:49] most. But then it's interesting that USA
[03:53] is is now really steaming ahead with the
[03:55] national uh policies and then I'm like,
[03:59] oh, USA should be the last country to
[04:02] really really get Bitcoin for some
[04:04] reason. Yeah, I'm not sure that that a
[04:07] lot of people in the USA really get
[04:09] Bitcoin. Um, even the people that are
[04:11] that are pushing some of these Bitcoin
[04:13] bills and regulations. Um, one of the
[04:16] things that's interesting about Bitcoin
[04:18] is that there are so many different
[04:19] aspects of it that you can get. And so,
[04:22] a lot of books about Bitcoin just focus
[04:25] on monetary policy and it's like a
[04:28] better version of gold. It's gold, but
[04:30] it's more divisible and it's more
[04:32] transactable. And they don't understand
[04:34] the the censorship resistance and the
[04:37] privacy and peer-to-peer. None of that
[04:39] stuff even really matters to them. It's
[04:41] just gold was great and and so Bitcoin
[04:43] is great for the same reasons. Um so
[04:47] yeah, I think you can understand that
[04:49] and think that Bitcoin is valuable and
[04:50] still not get the full picture of what
[04:53] Bitcoin offers. If you tell the the
[04:55] story of Bitcoin through gold, you get
[04:57] that. If you tell the story of Bitcoin
[04:59] through cipher punks, then you get a
[05:01] very different understanding of Bitcoin
[05:03] that you might not even care that much
[05:05] about the supply cap, the 21 million,
[05:08] the the predictable issuance schedule.
[05:11] um you just see this native digital
[05:14] cache that you can transact peer-to-peer
[05:17] relatively privately and think, "Oh,
[05:19] that's great. I don't even care what the
[05:20] underlying asset is. It's it's this
[05:22] protocol that lets me do these
[05:24] transactions that that's really
[05:26] valuable." So, um it's fascinating to me
[05:28] how many different aspects of Bitcoin
[05:29] there are to understand.
[05:32] It's like there's there's so many
[05:34] different cases like you have the uh
[05:37] philosophical case for Bitcoin, but
[05:39] there's so many different cases and so
[05:41] many different perspectives on Bitcoin
[05:43] how you can compl uh explain it to
[05:45] someone else. And it also I I like I
[05:48] mean a good point just because there is
[05:51] now a president of in America that uh is
[05:55] talking about it and and doing some
[05:56] policies around that doesn't mean the
[05:59] USA has the the biggest grassroots
[06:01] adoption. I think Nigeria and and those
[06:03] places are probably higher especially
[06:06] when we look at Bitcoin from a medium of
[06:09] exchange side and not just from a store
[06:11] of value. Uh but yeah, it's it's it's
[06:14] that it's that bottom up uh approach
[06:16] that Bitcoin is is strong for. I mean,
[06:19] even even if a politician adopts it,
[06:21] it's it's still uh bottom up because he
[06:24] only adopts it because he sees that it's
[06:26] it's popular and and that that it's
[06:28] something that the people want. So even
[06:30] like if a politician does it like Trump
[06:32] didn't do it because he's like, "Oh,
[06:34] like I love Bitcoin." No, like people
[06:37] pushed the idea of Bitcoin to him, I
[06:40] guess. Yeah, I think that's exactly
[06:42] right. And and he started talking about
[06:45] it maybe for political reasons or
[06:47] electoral reasons, if he has any. He has
[06:49] it because he thinks that it's going to
[06:51] increase in value. But him having it
[06:53] helps the people in Nigeria who are
[06:55] using it as a medium of exchange. um the
[06:57] more people that want it, the more the
[06:58] value of it goes up and so the more
[07:00] valuable their Bitcoin is. I like that.
[07:04] I'm super interested because I I I don't
[07:06] see a lot of uh people from academia
[07:09] like professors, teachers uh coming in
[07:11] Bitcoin. I think we had I I I don't know
[07:15] the profession of all the 500 guests
[07:16] that have been on the show, but on top
[07:19] of my head, I know three teachers that
[07:20] have been on uh teachers or professors.
[07:23] Uh what is is that just me or is there
[07:26] like a lack of education in Bitcoin
[07:30] especially in academia?
[07:32] Yeah, I I it's not just you. Um there
[07:36] are some economists who are interested
[07:38] in it and and have been for a while. Uh
[07:40] I think Will Luther published an
[07:42] academic paper on Bitcoin in 2011. Um
[07:45] that's the earliest one that I know of
[07:48] or have cited. Um there's a lot in
[07:50] computer science. It's it's tapered off
[07:52] quite a bit as as Bitcoin gets less
[07:55] interesting and other crypto projects uh
[07:58] capture the minds of of people in
[08:00] computer science and also uh there's
[08:03] financial incentives to to work on other
[08:06] things. Any crypto project that has a
[08:10] foundation or a leader or a premine or
[08:13] an ICO or something like that can pay
[08:18] for graduate students. They can pay for
[08:20] posttos. They can even give grants to
[08:22] professors to work on their specific
[08:24] project. Um, so these more centralized
[08:27] projects are able to recruit more people
[08:29] to work on them because they can pay
[08:31] them to do that. Um, one of the reasons
[08:33] that we launched the Bitcoin Research
[08:35] Institute was as a an understanding of
[08:38] this phenomenon that there just aren't
[08:41] enough academics that are interested in
[08:43] Bitcoin. And despite being what now 70%
[08:46] or so of the market cap of all of crypto
[08:50] um Bitcoin gets much less attention in
[08:53] these academic journals and it's I think
[08:56] because of the structure. So we wanted
[08:57] to incentivize
[08:59] uh people to work on Bitcoin through
[09:01] offering article prizes and conferences
[09:03] things like that. There's also in
[09:05] addition to the monetary effects,
[09:07] there's I think two other aspects that
[09:11] mean that academics aren't getting as
[09:12] into Bitcoin. One is just inertia. You
[09:15] tend to work on what your supervisor in
[09:18] graduate school worked on and most
[09:20] supervisors uh for students who who are
[09:23] in grad school are in their 50s and 60s
[09:25] and they worked on what their supervisor
[09:27] worked on. And so it's hard for new
[09:29] things like Bitcoin to break in um and
[09:33] be something that you can write a
[09:34] dissertation on. A lot of advisers will
[09:36] just say I can't competently advise you
[09:38] on that. And so you can't find anyone
[09:40] even if you are interested in Bitcoin to
[09:42] work on it. And then there's almost a
[09:43] social stigma um at least in some fields
[09:47] against working on things related to
[09:49] money. And then especially something
[09:51] like Bitcoin which I think um its
[09:54] opponents has successfully labeled as a
[09:57] right-wing phenomenon. Um, there was
[10:00] this really bad book that came out um
[10:03] almost 10 years ago now called Bitcoin
[10:06] Software as right-wing
[10:09] extremism and it tries to trace this
[10:13] libertarian history of Bitcoin and and
[10:16] guilt by association Bitcoin with all
[10:18] these uh other figures. And you know
[10:21] anyone who knows about Bitcoin knows
[10:23] that there are probably an outsized
[10:25] percentage of libertarians who are
[10:27] interested in it compared to you know
[10:29] other things. Um on the other hand
[10:33] the story of the cipher punks is not a
[10:37] purely libertarian story. There were um
[10:40] some left-wing socialist uh radicals who
[10:43] were cipher punks who you imagine would
[10:46] la bitcoin for for different reasons.
[10:49] But um so I think because academia is
[10:53] traditionally left-leaning and because
[10:55] Bitcoin is successfully been painted as
[10:58] right-wing um people are scared to work
[11:00] on it because they don't want to be
[11:02] perceived to be uh a member of that
[11:05] political tribe.
[11:07] Yeah, it's it's it's super interesting
[11:09] how how Bitcoin itself isn't political,
[11:12] but of course the people involved in um
[11:15] and Bitcoin can be political and there's
[11:17] like a tendency towards uh different uh
[11:20] directions. But for me, I mean I'm a
[11:23] libertarian, but like Bitcoin can be
[11:25] such a social thing. It's like there
[11:28] there's no discrimination that like
[11:30] everyone can have the same access to to
[11:32] Bitcoin. There's a lot of social ideas
[11:35] in Bitcoin. If you take out the idea of
[11:38] of communism, like, hey, we need a
[11:40] central banks that controls everything.
[11:42] We have to plan the economy. But there's
[11:44] a lot of social fairness and and social
[11:46] ideas in in Bitcoin. And and one also
[11:49] interesting point is I I don't remember
[11:52] who's who coined it or who who said
[11:54] that, but um I I heard a lot Satoshi
[11:57] brought science back into money. Before
[11:59] it was just kind of soyo science money
[12:02] and now there's like real science like
[12:05] with proof of work and it connects to
[12:07] energy. It's engineered money. It's it's
[12:09] the engineering uh of of money. So from
[12:13] a logical perspective, maybe that's just
[12:15] my Bitcoin classes on from a logical
[12:19] perspective, academia and science should
[12:22] be super excited about u having
[12:25] something like Bitcoin where all of a
[12:27] sudden it's not five people that decides
[12:29] monetary policy. It's a uh it's a
[12:33] consensus is mathematics that's kind of
[12:36] decides what what money is. Yeah. Uh I
[12:40] mean I I have sat in on some monetary
[12:42] theory uh classes here at at the
[12:45] University of Wyoming and I think
[12:46] there's there's a lot of science and a
[12:48] lot of math involved in standard
[12:52] economics non- Bitcoin Keynesian. I mean
[12:55] it's all there was a shift at some point
[12:57] into this purely mathematical model. And
[13:00] in fact, the the Austrian school was was
[13:02] a a group who was trying to do less math
[13:06] and more sort of opriori thinking about
[13:09] what money should be and like te telling
[13:13] others you can't just go based on these
[13:15] mathematical models. You have to
[13:16] understand human psychology and how
[13:18] people think about money and how say
[13:21] creating new money not just affects the
[13:23] money supply which is a number but also
[13:25] affects um the way people think about
[13:27] money. So I mean there there's certainly
[13:30] a lot of of science and engineering that
[13:32] goes into Bitcoin. I think you know the
[13:35] solution to the Byzantine general's
[13:36] problem is a very mathematically heavy
[13:40] and and
[13:41] and computer sciency puzzle. Um but I
[13:44] think there's also an understanding of
[13:46] game theory and incentive structures and
[13:48] human psychology. Um, we wrote this uh
[13:51] my co-authors of of the book and I wrote
[13:54] an an op-ed on the having um where we we
[13:59] wonder whether maybe Satoshi looked at
[14:00] things like the World Cup and the
[14:02] Olympics and US presidential elections
[14:05] all of which happen every four years and
[14:06] get all this fanfare and and thought,
[14:09] you know, if a having comes around every
[14:11] four years, people are going to be
[14:14] talking about it in the leadup to it,
[14:16] it's going to drive interest and and
[14:17] Bitcoin is going to have these cycles of
[14:19] interests that follow the having cycles
[14:21] kind of like you know I'm not watching
[14:23] any swimming right now but when the
[14:25] Olympics comes around I'm going to watch
[14:26] swimming which I never do because it it
[14:29] only happens every four years and it's
[14:31] interesting u so in addition to all of
[14:34] this I think putting together of
[14:36] classical um computer science parts
[14:40] together in a in a brand new way um
[14:42] Satoshi also added a lot of
[14:44] understanding of social science and
[14:46] psychology and things like
[14:49] It's it's super
[14:50] interesting. I mean, uh it's an obvious
[14:53] question maybe for you, but what's what
[14:56] how how would you to describe the philos
[14:58] philosophy behind Bitcoin?
[15:01] Um that's a good question and I in the
[15:04] book we give a philosophical case for
[15:07] Bitcoin, but we don't try to give a
[15:09] philosophy of Bitcoin. Um, other people
[15:12] have tried to do that and I I think
[15:15] that there's just too much that you
[15:18] could um there are too many
[15:20] philosophical reasons that you could
[15:22] like Bitcoin um you know from from being
[15:25] right libertarian to being left
[15:26] libertarian um to issues about justice
[15:30] and um democracy, social cohesion.
[15:35] So what we try to do instead is give a
[15:37] philosophical framework for thinking
[15:39] about Bitcoin that also can be applied
[15:42] to other things. Um it's the
[15:44] philosophical framework offered by John
[15:47] Harani who's an economist and and then
[15:49] later John RS um who was a philosopher
[15:52] and they use it to think about
[15:54] governments um and economic principles
[15:58] and things like that. Um and it it's
[16:00] called the veil of ignorance. So the
[16:02] idea is that you
[16:04] imagine you go to sleep tonight and when
[16:07] you wake up in the morning, you have no
[16:09] idea which person on earth you're going
[16:12] to be. Uh and there's an equal chance
[16:15] that you could be anyone. Uh so there's
[16:17] a roughly a 1 in 8 billion chance that
[16:19] you wake up as you. There's a 1 in 8
[16:21] billion chance that you wake up as me.
[16:23] There's a 1 in 8 billion chance that you
[16:24] wake up as Donald Trump. there's a one
[16:26] in eight billion chance that you wake up
[16:28] as um a particular farmer in China. And
[16:34] the question is, if you didn't know who
[16:36] you'd be when you woke up tomorrow, um
[16:39] would you want to wake up in a world
[16:40] with Bitcoin or a world without Bitcoin?
[16:44] And this is supposed to get you past a
[16:47] lot of the self-interested reasons that
[16:49] you might be in favor of Bitcoin or in
[16:53] favor of a particular um political
[16:55] system that maybe you benefit from. Um
[16:58] and RS thought that this way of thinking
[17:03] uh promoted this idea of
[17:08] um making sure that the people who are
[17:10] the worst off still have enough to
[17:13] survive. So you'd want to make sure that
[17:15] no matter who you woke up as, you
[17:17] weren't going to die of starvation that
[17:18] day because you didn't have enough food.
[17:21] Um, and so you'd want, of course, people
[17:23] to be able to get really wealthy if they
[17:27] uh worked really hard and were really
[17:29] geniuses or or made good decisions or
[17:31] even got lucky. But you'd also want to
[17:34] make sure that everyone was taken care
[17:35] of. And so we sort of think a similar
[17:38] thing about Bitcoin. Um, the people who
[17:41] are benefiting from Bitcoin, especially
[17:43] as a medium of exchange, are people who
[17:46] don't have other options. They don't
[17:48] have access to the US dollar. They don't
[17:50] have access to stock markets. They don't
[17:52] have access to any store of value that's
[17:55] that's better than Bitcoin. And we've
[17:57] all seen Bitcoin, you know, crash 92%
[18:00] sometimes. U and so if you're in a
[18:02] position where that's the the best thing
[18:04] that you have, um then you're certainly
[18:07] going to want to wake up in a world that
[18:09] has it. Um and so there are a lot more
[18:11] people who would be harmed waking up uh
[18:14] in a non Bitcoin world than people who
[18:17] would be harmed waking up in a Bitcoin
[18:19] world. There are people who've lost a
[18:20] lot of money on Bitcoin. There are
[18:22] people who have staked their reputation
[18:25] on Bitcoin going to zero or being
[18:27] worthless. They're just a much smaller
[18:29] amount of people. Um, and they're not
[18:31] that harmed. You know, Paul Krugman is
[18:34] slightly harmed every day that Bitcoin
[18:36] succeeds because for 10 years he's been
[18:37] saying that it's worthless, but he's not
[18:39] that harmed. He's still very financially
[18:41] secure. Um but these people who are
[18:44] using Bitcoin to uh undermine
[18:47] authoritarianism in uh let's say
[18:50] Zimbabwe or
[18:53] um some of these other countries that
[18:55] are undergoing hyperinflation. They
[18:58] really need Bitcoin and you could wake
[19:00] up as them tomorrow. So you probably
[19:04] want to wake up in the Bitcoin world.
[19:06] That's sort of the philosophical
[19:07] framework that we suggest people use
[19:09] when they're thinking through Bitcoin
[19:11] and then go through all these steps. Uh
[19:13] how does Bitcoin's monetary policy
[19:14] affect all these people? How does the
[19:16] privacy affect all these people? And so
[19:18] that's I never heard that and that's so
[19:21] brilliant. I I really love that because
[19:24] it's it shows like it it takes out the
[19:28] ego and if you really have the choice of
[19:32] hey I want to wake up tomorrow and it's
[19:35] not sure who I wake up to like it's
[19:38] literally 8 billion people and I could
[19:39] wake up as anyone. Do I want to wake up
[19:42] in a completely feared world or do I
[19:45] want to wake up in a complete Bitcoin
[19:46] world? If I wake up maybe in a fiat
[19:49] world and if I'm the wrong person, maybe
[19:53] I don't have access to money because
[19:56] fiat not everyone has access to and how
[19:58] do how do I get by this day? But if I
[20:01] know I wake up in a Bitcoin world and I
[20:03] know 100% certainty I have access
[20:06] somehow to
[20:08] Bitcoin, that's a way better world. It's
[20:11] like like even if you start as the as
[20:15] the unluckiest uh worst off person from
[20:18] all those 8 billion people, you still
[20:21] know you have a chance if you work your
[20:24] butt off. You like you have you have
[20:26] something to look forward even of course
[20:28] if if it's like a full Bitcoin uh
[20:30] standard world. That's an interesting
[20:32] comparison. Uh why why did I never heard
[20:34] that?
[20:36] Good question. Um cuz philosophers
[20:38] aren't paying enough attention to
[20:39] Bitcoin, I guess. Um and and there are
[20:41] so we don't suggest that every single
[20:43] person obviously will be better off um
[20:45] in the Bitcoin world. There there are
[20:47] some people as I mentioned Paul Krugman
[20:48] and others who will be worse off. There
[20:50] are also some people who it just doesn't
[20:52] matter. They don't have enough at all.
[20:54] Um if if you're in a small village in uh
[20:59] you know some country where you don't
[21:00] have internet access, Bitcoin's probably
[21:02] not going to help you, but it's also not
[21:04] going to harm you. You're you're not
[21:05] going to be any worse off. And so you
[21:08] just take the number of people who will
[21:10] be better off, figure out how much
[21:12] better off they'll be, figure out how
[21:14] important they are, um, and then the
[21:17] people who will be harmed, how much
[21:19] they'll be harmed, how important they
[21:20] are, um, and then do some you can just
[21:24] do math with that and figure out um,
[21:26] whether Bitcoin is good for the world
[21:29] overall. And we think after going
[21:31] through all of the possible ways in
[21:33] which Bitcoin affects all these people,
[21:35] we we think it's pretty clear
[21:38] that Bitcoin is good for the world. Is
[21:41] it then
[21:44] ethically is it ethically good or not
[21:46] good to pay someone in fiat? Question.
[21:50] Um I paid many people in fiat yesterday
[21:53] when I went out to lunch and when I got
[21:56] coffee.
[21:57] Um, so it's complicated. It's good for
[22:01] them.
[22:03] Um,
[22:05] because maybe the best thing is to teach
[22:08] them about Bitcoin and, you know,
[22:10] suggest that they start taking Bitcoin,
[22:12] explain who Bitcoin is good for and who
[22:14] they would be helping by participating
[22:15] in this network. Um, but that takes a
[22:18] lot of work and it's hard to do that
[22:19] with everyone that you buy something
[22:21] from. I know some people do it. Um, good
[22:23] on them.
[22:25] Uh, but I'm not sure that participating
[22:29] in the the fiat system is ethically
[22:33] wrong as or is morally wrong. Um, I
[22:37] haven't actually thought that much about
[22:38] that. It seems like there are a lot of a
[22:42] lot of considerations that go in in both
[22:44] directions. Um, and you are in some
[22:47] sense off the hook because it was the
[22:50] system that you are born into and you
[22:52] can't change it by yourself. Um, that's
[22:56] consistent with it being morally better
[22:58] to transact in Bitcoin when you can.
[23:00] Yeah, it's just it's it's like for for
[23:04] me it's interesting because for just
[23:06] from first principles if I pay someone
[23:08] in Bitcoin obviously if he doesn't
[23:10] accept Bitcoin then there's nothing
[23:12] wrong with paying him in fiat because he
[23:13] he doesn't even want to get paid in
[23:15] Bitcoin. But if like both options are on
[23:19] on the table and you pay someone in
[23:22] Bitcoin theoretically this is the money
[23:25] that will gain in value over time. So
[23:28] the moment you he gets it h the longer
[23:31] he keeps it the gift keeps on giving to
[23:35] to him feared it it gets devalued from
[23:40] the first minute onward obviously it's
[23:42] it's not like a minute onwards but like
[23:45] theoretically every minute uh feat gets
[23:48] a little bit devalued with the money
[23:49] printing. So just from first principles,
[23:52] if both options are on the table, I feel
[23:54] like it's it's better to pay someone and
[23:57] more appreciating to pay someone in
[24:00] Bitcoin. And I've it's it's super fun
[24:02] because I I've completely switched I
[24:05] think the last few months uh to living
[24:08] in Bitcoin and they still have a bank
[24:10] account, but when I pay something with a
[24:12] bank account, I always keep it at zero.
[24:14] So if I go in the negative, I just pay
[24:17] off with with Bitcoin. what I've got in
[24:19] the negative I've got in the positive
[24:20] then I buy Bitcoin just keep it at zero
[24:23] and the interesting thing that happened
[24:26] is that I'm very like completely
[24:29] detached now from the Bitcoin price
[24:31] because I earn Bitcoin I I pay in
[24:33] Bitcoin it doesn't matter like I'm
[24:35] anyways 100% in it uh what do I care if
[24:38] it goes up or down and then uh the other
[24:41] interesting thing that happened that I'm
[24:44] really more looking
[24:47] for what I spend on it. It's it's it's
[24:50] that it's it sounds so cliche but it's
[24:53] really if you know if I spend that I
[24:56] have to spend from my Bitcoin. It's not
[24:58] coming from my bank account. It I have
[25:01] to spend that from my Bitcoin stack. And
[25:03] I know it's not
[25:05] logical to have that barrier just
[25:08] because it's a different money. Uh but
[25:10] it it it really feels different. So I I
[25:13] appreciate things more that I buy with
[25:15] Bitcoin than things that I buy with
[25:18] fiat, even though I'm anyways 100% in
[25:20] it. So it it it shouldn't matter, but
[25:23] there is something in my brain that says
[25:26] like, "Oh, don't don't get away your
[25:28] Bitcoin." And yeah, like spend your fiat
[25:31] fiat you can you can spend that. So it's
[25:34] super interesting to to think about the
[25:36] the those things. Yeah, I I think I I am
[25:40] slightly different in that it it's just
[25:43] really hard around here to pay in
[25:45] Bitcoin. Both from a merchant acceptance
[25:49] perspective, but also from the tax
[25:51] reporting perspective. supposed to for
[25:54] every Bitcoin transaction calculate the
[25:57] price at which I purchased that Bitcoin,
[25:59] the price at which I sold it for coffee
[26:02] or uh brisket or whatever, and then pay
[26:05] capital gains tax on that, which is just
[26:08] too difficult to do. Um, so I think for
[26:11] every purchase that I make, um, I could
[26:14] use this money to buy Bitcoin or I could
[26:17] use it to buy this other thing. Um, do I
[26:20] value this other thing as much as I
[26:22] value the Bitcoin that I could get? Um,
[26:26] and theoretically these two should be
[26:28] the same. Um, whether you already have
[26:31] the Bitcoin or whether you don't, um,
[26:33] the opportunity costs are still exactly
[26:35] the same. Um, psychologically, we know
[26:39] that it's different. there's this uh
[26:41] well-known cognitive bias called the
[26:44] endowment effect, which is that once you
[26:46] have something, you value it more highly
[26:48] than before you had it. And so already
[26:51] having the Bitcoin and having to trade
[26:52] the Bitcoin, you value the Bitcoin more
[26:55] highly than someone who is making the
[26:57] decision between buying Bitcoin and
[26:58] buying the thing that you're deciding uh
[27:01] whether or not to buy. So yeah, it's
[27:03] weird that that it does make a
[27:05] difference, but uh I totally believe
[27:07] that it does and that it's harder once
[27:09] you already have the Bitcoin to get rid
[27:11] of it than it is just to choose not to
[27:13] buy it in the first place. I made uh I I
[27:17] had I struggled really with with that
[27:19] bias of like I don't want to spend from
[27:21] my Bitcoin stack. I separated then uh my
[27:26] bitcoin setup for uh longterm savings
[27:30] and my bitcoin setup for or this those
[27:33] bitcoin I can spend and if from those
[27:35] bitcoin there's something u surplus I
[27:38] can go give that to the long-term
[27:39] savings setup uh and this allowed me to
[27:43] finally break through from oh I don't
[27:45] want to spend my bitcoin like if I I
[27:48] earn 70% of my income in bitcoin only
[27:51] 10% or something like that I can spend
[27:53] in bitcoin directly. So naturally I have
[27:55] to sell bitcoin to pay my fiat bills.
[27:58] Mhm. But I had I really struggled with
[28:01] that. And as soon as
[28:03] I said like okay there are two different
[28:06] buckets of bitcoin. I can spend that.
[28:09] It's still bitcoin but I I allow myself
[28:11] to spend that. I I it it was easier for
[28:14] me if if anyone was like how can how can
[28:18] I get over that? Yeah. And I mean it it
[28:21] is reminiscent of what my parents taught
[28:24] me growing up which is you have your
[28:26] savings account you have your checking
[28:27] account uh spend out of your checking
[28:29] account once something goes into your
[28:31] savings account it stays there you you
[28:33] don't take it out of that except in you
[28:35] know case of major emergency but in
[28:38] practice like it's on the same app and I
[28:41] can transfer from the savings account to
[28:43] the checking account in seconds. Um,
[28:46] with Bitcoin, right, you can make it so
[28:48] that your long-term stored Bitcoin. You
[28:51] have to physically travel somewhere to
[28:54] access, you know, one of the private
[28:56] keys to unlock this multisig to then
[28:58] spend it. So, you can you can actually
[29:00] force yourself to make it really
[29:01] difficult to spend your savings.
[29:05] Um, I think that our I mean I don't know
[29:09] if it's nefarious or not, but our
[29:10] financial system is not set up in such a
[29:13] way as to make it difficult to spend um
[29:17] the thing that you should be saving. Uh
[29:19] it's a very
[29:20] spendingoriented economy. And so one of
[29:23] the things that I think is really cool
[29:24] about Bitcoin is that you can actually
[29:26] do this geographically distributed
[29:28] thing. I can send Bitcoin to an address
[29:30] that would take me days to spend from.
[29:33] And I really like that. Yeah, there's
[29:35] even I mean you can even time lock it
[29:38] and say like oh like that stack I can
[29:40] only access after a year. Even if
[29:42] there's an emergency I literally can't
[29:44] access that stack. So there's like it
[29:47] it's really fun when uh money becomes
[29:50] programmable for for yourself and you're
[29:52] like you can really 100% individually
[29:56] say that's how I I I keep it. I mean if
[29:59] you uh like and and for for for self
[30:02] custody setups it's also interesting
[30:04] because people have fear of like wrench
[30:06] attacks and like what if someone comes
[30:08] to my house. Yeah. Like keep 80% uh of
[30:11] your money if you can do that in in a in
[30:13] a I don't know 6 months time lock like
[30:16] you literally can't give it to give it
[30:18] to anyone. So, uh, with with Bitcoin,
[30:21] you have all the possibilities and and
[30:23] and and I love that. And I'm really
[30:25] wondering a lot and and you probably are
[30:27] the best guest for that. I I I feel like
[30:29] what is Bitcoin really changing on an
[30:33] individual level outside of money? Yeah.
[30:36] Like of of course we we might get a
[30:38] little less spendy. We we have some
[30:40] money uh sovereignty rights and stuff
[30:42] like that. But do you think there's
[30:44] something changing on our social side of
[30:47] things?
[30:48] I think
[30:50] so. Social and political side of things.
[30:53] So I think on the political side of
[30:57] things, this is just starting, but but I
[31:00] think will increase dramatically as it
[31:02] gets easier and easier to access Bitcoin
[31:04] as more people have it and are willing
[31:06] to sell it peer-to-peer.
[31:09] uh the competitors to Bitcoin,
[31:13] specifically
[31:15] um fiat currencies issued by
[31:17] governments, uh and especially as we're
[31:19] as we're seeing now being developed,
[31:20] central bank digital currencies, have to
[31:23] reckon with the fact that people have
[31:25] other options and that one of these
[31:26] options, Bitcoin, is really popular and
[31:29] really good and does a lot of things
[31:30] really well. And they know that people
[31:33] can opt into Bitcoin at any time. And so
[31:37] if if you make your central bank digital
[31:39] currency not private, if you allow back
[31:42] doors to confiscate people's money from
[31:46] their accounts, you sort of uh put
[31:50] destruction times on the coins so that
[31:53] if the person doesn't spend them, they
[31:54] lose them. That sort of thing. People
[31:56] just aren't going to use it because they
[31:58] have another option that that's Bitcoin.
[32:00] And that option has proven impossible to
[32:02] root out and and get rid of. Um, on the
[32:05] social level, I think there uh it does
[32:08] allow this peer-to-peer
[32:11] transactions. In a lot of ways though,
[32:13] bit Bitcoin is like cash in that sense.
[32:16] You can still buy things at farmers
[32:19] markets in cash. I do I do that all the
[32:21] time. Um, so I'm not sure that aspect of
[32:25] of transaction is changing that much on
[32:29] an individual
[32:31] uh social or or psychological level. So
[32:33] I I'd have to think a little bit more
[32:35] about how I I mean clearly one thing
[32:38] that's happening is there are
[32:39] communities that are being built around
[32:43] their
[32:44] understanding and appreciation of
[32:46] Bitcoin. So you see these Bitcoin
[32:48] circular economies popping up in El
[32:50] Salvador, in Brazil, in Bangkok, uh, and
[32:54] other places where groups of people just
[32:56] agree to transact in and exclusively in
[32:58] Bitcoin. And that brings a certain
[33:00] amount of like social, uh, cohesion to
[33:04] those groups in ways that you'd
[33:06] obviously never see with government
[33:09] currencies. Nobody's like, "Let's start
[33:11] a dollar club and we'll all just pay
[33:13] each other in dollars and ah aren't we
[33:17] aren't we likely to be friends because
[33:18] of that." Um, but there's some aspect of
[33:23] um
[33:25] of being in interested and involved in
[33:27] Bitcoin that is different. Let's take a
[33:30] break for a moment and appreciate the
[33:32] beauty that Coin Vigilante has made with
[33:35] the Bitcoin watches. Those watches are
[33:38] the most amazing. the most elegant way
[33:41] of showing that you are a true
[33:43] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[33:46] dropped a completely new and amazing
[33:49] Genesis edition of their watch
[33:51] collections. You have the date of the
[33:54] first ever mind Bitcoin block in there
[33:57] and of course also the block height and
[34:00] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[34:03] the level of detail they put in in this
[34:06] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[34:08] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[34:11] down in the descriptions. I love those
[34:13] watches so so much. And now if you have
[34:17] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[34:19] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[34:21] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[34:23] to deal with that. The first way is you
[34:26] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[34:28] entry for you to get into the
[34:30] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[34:34] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[34:36] super simple and secure way. And if you
[34:39] check out the link in the description,
[34:41] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[34:44] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[34:47] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[34:50] partner in terms of how to get the most
[34:53] out of your sovereignty. They will
[34:56] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[34:59] that is perfect for your individual
[35:02] situation. They will show you how you
[35:04] can secure your own devices. Securing
[35:07] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[35:09] have to keep all your devices secure.
[35:11] One topic that is overlooked often is
[35:14] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[35:16] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[35:19] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[35:22] place already? And last but not least,
[35:24] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[35:26] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[35:28] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[35:33] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[35:36] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[35:39] be for the first time ever speaking at
[35:41] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[35:44] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[35:47] really looking forward to seeing all of
[35:49] you there. You can get your ticket in
[35:51] the link down in the description of
[35:53] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[35:56] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[36:00] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[36:01] there. It's also the um I live near
[36:05] Czech and and and in check there's a
[36:08] different currency than there is in in
[36:10] Austria, even though both are in in in
[36:13] the EU. So like not every EU state
[36:15] actually uses the euro. And it's it's
[36:19] really interesting when you drive with
[36:20] your car, let's say 3 hours, and all of
[36:22] the sudden you have to spend a different
[36:23] currency. And in Europe, you can drive
[36:26] um a few miles and all of the sudden you
[36:28] you spend another different currency. Uh
[36:30] you you can literally drive in one day
[36:32] through multiple different currencies
[36:34] and you have to pay different currencies
[36:36] as different gas gas stations. And it it
[36:41] it's just such a beautiful world when we
[36:43] all just use the same money. It's it's I
[36:46] I I really hate when things get
[36:48] complicated and I oh I go to the
[36:51] holidays and then like oh like what what
[36:53] currency can I can I use my credit card
[36:56] there and then and all all those things
[36:58] and how much do I get charged when I get
[37:00] now in an ATM? It's always a question. I
[37:02] don't know if you if you have
[37:04] experienced that if you go to an ATM
[37:06] outside of your country you're like how
[37:09] much are they going to charge me now
[37:11] that I got like $20 out of there? Um,
[37:13] oh, like they charge me now $5 just to
[37:16] get $20 out. That's that's a hefty fee.
[37:18] I don't know. I have to hope that
[37:20] Bitcoin kind of connects us more because
[37:22] we use all the same money uh and brings
[37:25] us closer to like
[37:27] a singularity of of of of the world.
[37:30] There's like um how is it called the
[37:32] type one civilization? Uh those those
[37:35] scales, I forgot the name of it. uh that
[37:37] brings us a little bit closer to that
[37:39] that we can use Bitcoin as the
[37:41] denominator of the world in this I hope
[37:44] and I I I think so that actually changes
[37:47] something socially uh because all of the
[37:49] sudden those border lines are getting a
[37:53] little more uh let's say little less
[37:56] important. You drive over a border, you
[37:58] have the same money. uh you could work
[38:01] there also remotely like all all those
[38:03] things uh kind of uh come to that uh
[38:06] come to that uh vision. I don't know how
[38:09] you look at that. Yeah, I I think that's
[38:12] exactly right. I just imagine that you
[38:15] could travel from your country to
[38:17] another country and you have two options
[38:19] when you get there. You can stay at a
[38:22] hotel and eat at restaurants and
[38:24] whatever that use the money that you
[38:26] already have or you can stay at a hotel
[38:30] and eat at restaurants and stuff that
[38:32] where you have to exchange your money
[38:34] first. All other things being equal,
[38:36] you're always going to just want to be
[38:38] able to come with what you have, use the
[38:40] credit cards you have, use the cash that
[38:42] you have, and then come back. You're not
[38:44] going to want to have to go through
[38:45] these extra hoops of exchanging. And you
[38:48] know there's not a lot of places that
[38:50] you can do that with US dollars uh
[38:52] outside of the US. There are some um
[38:55] imagine you have Bitcoin. There are
[38:58] going to be communities like this in
[39:00] every country in the world where you can
[39:03] have your your lightning wallet and
[39:06] travel there and pay for hotel, food,
[39:09] excursions, all that stuff. Um and never
[39:12] having to exchange your Bitcoin for
[39:14] anything else. never having to exchange
[39:16] your uh governmentbacked currencies for
[39:19] anything else. Given those options, uh I
[39:22] think everyone is going to pick to
[39:24] everyone who uses Bitcoin is going to
[39:26] pick to travel to the to the Bitcoin
[39:27] locations. And the more that that
[39:30] happens, the more other places see, you
[39:32] know, this area is getting all this
[39:35] tourism because they accept Bitcoin.
[39:38] Um it it's so easy to accept Bitcoin
[39:41] that that's going to incentivize more
[39:43] people to accept Bitcoin and so on till
[39:45] eventually you get to the point where
[39:46] anywhere that you want to go you can
[39:48] easily find uh places that accept
[39:51] Bitcoin. Yeah. And and the the whole
[39:54] vision of the sovereign individual is
[39:56] getting fulfilled where the nations all
[39:58] of the sudden have to compete for the
[40:01] the the brains and and the the people
[40:04] that they come there. Um you mentioned
[40:06] before previously I forgot to ask uh
[40:08] about the Bitcoin research in institute.
[40:11] What is that and like what are you doing
[40:12] there? Yeah the the Bitcoin research
[40:16] institute is something that is starting
[40:20] uh in July uh officially launching in
[40:22] July. So we announced it uh in Vegas or
[40:25] in Nashville Bitcoin Nashville last July
[40:29] and things in as I said things in
[40:30] academia move really slowly. So um we
[40:34] had the the gift in place. So it was uh
[40:38] it was started uh with a gift from Mark
[40:42] Casey. Um and the idea is
[40:48] to create, promote, disseminate um
[40:52] academic work on Bitcoin that appears in
[40:56] high impact academic journals that can
[40:59] be cited by journalists and policy
[41:01] makers and used to, you know, show
[41:05] people um what Bitcoin is like. One of
[41:08] the things that we found in writing the
[41:10] book um we have something like 600 uh
[41:14] works cited in the book and a lot of
[41:17] academic papers on Bitcoin we found just
[41:21] contained factual inaccuracies because
[41:23] they were written by people who spent a
[41:26] little bit of time studying Bitcoin and
[41:28] then thought that they had figured
[41:29] something out about it and then wrote a
[41:31] paper. And for some things you could do
[41:33] this. you can dip your toe into
[41:36] um certain certain topics and learn
[41:40] enough in a couple of months to write a
[41:44] paper and publish it. Um but it turns
[41:46] out Bitcoin is really complicated and a
[41:48] lot of these papers uh for example
[41:51] didn't know that there was a difficulty
[41:52] adjustment or didn't know what that
[41:54] meant. So they thought the more
[41:56] transactions there are, the more demand
[41:58] for Bitcoin there is um the more miners
[42:01] will be dedicating energy to it and so
[42:04] the faster that blocks will come. And
[42:07] it's like no, Bitcoin doesn't work like
[42:09] that. Um blocks can come faster. They
[42:12] can come faster for a little while. Um
[42:14] but there's going to be these
[42:15] adjustments. um or people didn't realize
[42:18] uh that there was a a reward for mining
[42:20] blocks outside of transaction fees or
[42:23] they didn't know um that Bitcoin digital
[42:28] signatures uh how they worked. They
[42:30] thought there was just private keys and
[42:32] u public addresses, things like that. So
[42:35] one in addition to producing research um
[42:39] and incentivizing people to produce good
[42:42] research, people who know about Bitcoin,
[42:44] who understand Bitcoin, um we also want
[42:46] to serve as a place where people who
[42:50] don't who understand that they don't
[42:52] know that much about Bitcoin can send
[42:54] their work and it can be evaluated and
[42:57] they can get comments from people who do
[43:00] understand Bitcoin. So if you're I mean
[43:02] this is exactly what happened with this
[43:04] uh this famous paper written by uh a
[43:08] bunch of undergraduate students at I
[43:10] think the University of Hawaii. Um and
[43:13] then signed on to by their their
[43:16] professor uh Camo Mora. So this paper is
[43:20] called Bitcoin mining alone will can can
[43:24] or will um increase global climates by 2
[43:28] degrees
[43:29] centigrade
[43:31] and they just they just missed the
[43:33] difficulty adjustment. None of them knew
[43:36] that it happened. So a person like that
[43:39] could send the paper to the Bitcoin
[43:41] Research Institute. Um I can look it
[43:44] over. Uh if it's too complicated, if
[43:46] there's too much math, right? I'm a
[43:47] philosopher. If there's too much math or
[43:48] computer science or something, I have a
[43:50] network of people that I can send it to
[43:52] that I trust to understand Bitcoin and
[43:54] understand the topic and say, "Hey, this
[43:56] person is looking for feedback on this
[43:58] paper. Um, can you just make sure they
[44:01] haven't missed anything?" Right? It's
[44:02] not it's not an attempt to keep negative
[44:05] papers about Bitcoin from being written
[44:07] or published, but it's an attempt to
[44:10] make sure that they're well researched
[44:12] and factually accurate, that they don't
[44:14] miss obvious uh things.
[44:17] So yeah, there there's kind of a lot of
[44:19] goals. The final goal is is just to
[44:21] provide a community for people who are,
[44:23] you know, grad students, junior faculty
[44:25] who are interested in Bitcoin, but
[44:28] haven't yet written anything about it
[44:29] because they don't see a reason to. So
[44:32] you can incentivize them economically
[44:34] by, you know, funding some of their
[44:37] research and things like that and we
[44:38] want to do that. But also I think people
[44:40] who are interested in Bitcoin as we
[44:42] talked about have community with other
[44:45] people who are interested in Bitcoin.
[44:47] Right? You and I have never talked
[44:49] before but we're getting along really
[44:51] well because we both find this this
[44:53] thing really interesting and you know if
[44:56] I was in the town that you live in or if
[44:58] you were here we we would look each
[44:59] other up and go out for a beer and talk
[45:01] about Bitcoin. So, if we provide a place
[45:04] where people can come and and talk about
[45:06] something they're interested in with
[45:08] other people who are interested in it,
[45:10] um we think that will be an incentive to
[45:12] to get them involved in the academic
[45:14] Bitcoin community. I love that. I I
[45:18] searched it but because I was like
[45:19] that's it that sounds really uh
[45:22] interesting. Is is that that paper but
[45:24] is is that Bitcoin that's the at paper?
[45:27] Yeah. Oh gosh. It's it's it it
[45:31] astonishes me that someone can publish
[45:34] something like that and doesn't know
[45:37] about the difficulty adjustment like
[45:38] like that that is that is lazy for me
[45:41] honestly. Yeah. And if you look at it so
[45:44] you see the publisher correction uh then
[45:46] you see three matters arising. So that
[45:49] was three people who within I mean
[45:52] before the article was even published it
[45:54] was published October 29th on August
[45:57] 28th. Oh, sorry. That that's a year
[45:59] later. So, a a year later, three
[46:02] distinct um papers came out criticizing
[46:05] various aspects of this paper. Um and
[46:08] yet, you look at the altimetric data, if
[46:11] you look at uh the citations, this has
[46:14] been cited hundreds and hundreds of
[46:16] times. Um and journalists who are
[46:18] looking to write about Bitcoin and and
[46:20] emissions and things like that, um they
[46:23] don't know that they need to look to
[46:24] these matters arising for for rebuttal.
[46:26] they just cite this provocative title um
[46:30] and and consider that good enough. So we
[46:33] think we think Bitcoiners owe it to the
[46:36] public, to journalists, to policy makers
[46:39] um to present them with factually
[46:42] accurate information about Bitcoin,
[46:45] especially at this time, Bitcoin mining.
[46:47] You know, at different times, different
[46:49] negative aspects of of Bitcoin have been
[46:51] seized on. So for a long time, it was
[46:52] criminals. U for a little while it was
[46:54] North Korea. Um the I think the the
[46:58] conversation is changing as more data
[47:00] comes out about just how um carbon
[47:04] neutral and green Bitcoin mining is. Um
[47:08] how it's balancing loads in various
[47:10] places, how it's electrifying villages
[47:12] in Kenya, you know, gridless. Um and so
[47:16] the conversation will switch and then
[47:18] there will be some other uh attack
[47:20] vector on Bitcoin. Um, but the more that
[47:24] we can publish accurate information
[47:26] about Bitcoin, um, the more that that
[47:30] can make its way into the the public
[47:32] consciousness.
[47:33] And it's so interesting because because
[47:36] of papers like this, it's really hard
[47:39] like when someone says, "Oh, studies
[47:41] shown uh or
[47:44] like according to that and like like who
[47:47] wrote that like and and and like why did
[47:50] he write that?" It it it makes the whole
[47:53] um field it it it sucks away the
[47:56] credibility from from all academia when
[47:59] like there's a few bad apples that write
[48:01] stuff like that that is is clearly lazy.
[48:04] Um uh then this this gets the
[48:08] credibility away from from from from
[48:10] most of them because then people say
[48:12] like oh like okay this is so wrong like
[48:14] like what else is wrong and and then I'm
[48:17] getting really critical if someone says
[48:20] oh because this study has shown this
[48:22] well like show me like what's in this
[48:24] study I don't trust any studies these
[48:27] days. Yeah. And in a lot of these
[48:29] studies, I'm I myself am not competent
[48:32] to judge the data set because I'm not
[48:35] schooled in in the methods to to
[48:37] understand it. But here at the
[48:39] University of Wyoming, we have a school
[48:40] of energy resources and there are people
[48:42] who are experts in uh let's say
[48:46] extraction of oil and oil wells and
[48:50] things like that. And so when I talk
[48:53] about Bitcoin um doing methane capture
[48:58] on oil wells um methane that was
[49:01] previously being vented or flared. They
[49:04] sort of know how to study how much
[49:06] Bitcoin is doing that what the effect on
[49:10] overall methane in the atmosphere is
[49:12] what the effect on uh climate change is.
[49:16] And I I you know I just didn't go to
[49:18] grad school for that. I don't I don't
[49:19] know the methods. I wouldn't be able to
[49:21] look at a paper and see, oh, this one
[49:23] missed something because they didn't
[49:25] account for this variable. I just don't
[49:27] know what all the variables are. So, the
[49:29] the bigger that we can build this
[49:31] network, the more academics that we can
[49:33] have getting interested in this and
[49:35] bringing their own areas of of
[49:37] specialization to bear. Um, I think the
[49:40] the more Bitcoin will benefit. Um,
[49:43] because I do think Bitcoin is good and I
[49:45] think ultimately the data will show
[49:47] that. I think Bitcoin mining is going to
[49:50] end up um contributing to a a major
[49:54] reversal in in climate change. And I
[49:57] think the data is already beginning to
[49:59] show that. And one of the reasons I
[50:01] think that is because, you know, I
[50:03] talked to Daniel Batton and I talked to
[50:04] Troy Cross and they explain it to me. Um
[50:07] I wouldn't be able to necessarily go
[50:09] find that out myself. Um, I think
[50:11] Bitcoin is preventing rolling blackouts
[50:13] in Texas because, um, major Bitcoin
[50:16] miners that are located in Texas are
[50:20] incentivizing grid buildout and then
[50:23] turning off in in periods of extreme
[50:26] heat or extreme cold and giving that
[50:28] power back to the network to power air
[50:30] conditioners and heaters. And fewer
[50:33] deaths in Texas, especially of children,
[50:35] will occur during these extreme weather
[50:37] events because of the Bitcoin miners.
[50:40] Um, so I think
[50:43] ultimately the data is going to show the
[50:46] positive effects that Bitcoin has. Um,
[50:49] but we need a lot of people who have a
[50:51] lot of different expertise to work on
[50:53] this. It can't it can't just all be
[50:55] economists and computer scientists who
[50:57] are working on Bitcoin. And I I have a
[50:59] Google alert uh a Google Scholar alert
[51:01] set for Bitcoin. So every day I get a
[51:04] digest of the Bitcoin papers that have
[51:06] been published uh in the previous day
[51:09] and I'll look at the most recent one um
[51:13] hedging Bitcoin uh Bitcoin and Ripple
[51:16] trading um Bitcoin performance Bitcoin
[51:21] deep learning models to estimate price.
[51:23] So, so much of it is focused on Bitcoin
[51:27] price. And that's really annoying
[51:30] because that to me, as you're finding,
[51:32] is one of the least interesting things
[51:34] about Bitcoin. It's like what its
[51:37] relation to the US dollar is at a point
[51:38] in time and what it will be next week.
[51:41] Um, I just I just don't care that much.
[51:43] Um, I think Bitcoin is far more
[51:45] important than that. And so, I want more
[51:47] papers about these other things coming
[51:49] out.
[51:50] I yeah I guess it's the it's a thing
[51:53] that precoiners that are interested in
[51:57] Bitcoin but not quite understand it look
[52:00] at it probably the most like what what's
[52:03] the price will will be I I know
[52:06] firsthand it it's just the best
[52:08] marketing tool but when you look inside
[52:11] of of of Bitcoiners they they then don't
[52:15] care about Bitcoin's price because they
[52:16] know like oh like they have gone through
[52:18] the cycles they they or the fundamentals
[52:20] and there anyways like many Bitcoiners
[52:23] that really fully understand Bitcoin
[52:25] have 50% plus of their portfolio and
[52:28] some lunatics like me 100% in in Bitcoin
[52:32] and then like what what does the price
[52:34] matter if you anyways 100% like what
[52:37] action can I take if if Bitcoin goes
[52:39] tomorrow at uh to down to like
[52:42] 10K I I cannot do anything I'm 100% in
[52:46] Bitcoin if it goes uh to 10 million then
[52:49] like I I can I can also not do anything.
[52:52] Maybe I can spend a little bit more but
[52:54] like what does this mean? Well, like
[52:56] maybe the the purchasing power is is is
[52:58] still the same. So, uh it it it does not
[53:01] really change anything that
[53:04] dramatically.
[53:06] Yeah. I mean, maybe if you if you like
[53:08] need a new car and you're thinking of
[53:10] spending half a bitcoin and then one day
[53:14] you wake up and you can get that car for
[53:18] 0.2 bitcoin, maybe maybe you buy, oh,
[53:20] the the car is a discount. On the other
[53:23] hand, you think, ah, maybe tomorrow
[53:24] it'll be 0.1 bitcoin. I mean, it's it's
[53:26] just exactly like using anything else
[53:29] except that um the purchasing power
[53:32] changes faster and changes in both
[53:34] directions, right? the the people always
[53:38] ask me when I give talks uh about
[53:39] Bitcoin, especially at non- Bitcoin
[53:41] audiences, they're like, "What about
[53:43] what about the volatility? Uh isn't that
[53:45] bad for people?" And in one sense, yes,
[53:49] it would be nice if it was more
[53:50] predictable um in terms of purchasing
[53:53] power. On the other hand, uh no, for a
[53:56] couple reasons. One is the only way to
[53:58] get stability and purchasing power is
[54:01] instability in supply. um as you know if
[54:04] you wanted the purchasing power to
[54:06] remain stable then as demand goes up
[54:07] supply has to go up as well in order to
[54:09] smooth all that stuff out but then
[54:11] supply becomes unpredictable and one of
[54:13] the cool things about Bitcoin is that
[54:15] the supply is completely predictable and
[54:17] then the other reason it's not bad is
[54:19] that um you might still prefer
[54:22] volatility to the up and downside versus
[54:25] just constant down which as you said is
[54:29] is how our our fiat currencies work from
[54:32] from the first minute that you get it,
[54:33] it's losing value. And for a time, it's
[54:37] small enough that you don't notice it.
[54:39] Um, but on the longer time horizons,
[54:42] it's not really much up and down. It's
[54:45] occasionally sideways, but with a goal
[54:47] of going down, right? The 2% inflation
[54:51] is a the pretty transparent goal that
[54:55] the US Federal Reserve has set. And if
[54:59] inflation is too low, if it's zero or
[55:02] even negative, um they're going to try
[55:05] to get it up. They're not going to be
[55:07] content with with no inflation. So, um
[55:11] yeah, people people might prefer
[55:14] volatility to um loss. I guess it's
[55:20] super interesting. Uh it's an
[55:22] interesting perspective change when you
[55:24] have Bitcoin and you want to save for
[55:28] house and let's say you have 0 uh 8
[55:32] bitcoin right now uh and and you want to
[55:35] uh don't you don't want to spend more
[55:37] than let's say uh 0.2 bitcoin. You can
[55:40] just wait till 0.2 bitcoin buys you a
[55:44] small house for yourself at some point.
[55:45] maybe 10 years, maybe 20 years, like
[55:47] whatever the the time frame is. In Fiat,
[55:51] if you want to save up to a house, you
[55:54] have to constantly get out and get more.
[55:58] So, you probably have to take over hours
[56:00] because you have to cover also the the
[56:01] the the cost of of of your living. And
[56:04] then the thing that you're saving is
[56:06] also getting diminished in value or like
[56:09] it doesn't get diminished in value but
[56:11] all the other things compared to that
[56:13] thing is getting higher in value. So
[56:16] you're constantly running behind
[56:17] something and in Bitcoin it's kind of
[56:19] like you can wait for something and this
[56:22] is this is an interesting perspective.
[56:24] If you already have like let's say 0.5
[56:27] Bitcoin and you're like oh let's wait
[56:28] till I can buy a house from it. Yeah.
[56:32] Yeah. I I'm content to wait.
[56:35] Yeah, that's I can I can wait for it.
[56:37] Um, how does this um all connect to uh
[56:42] the Bitcoin Research Institute and what
[56:44] are you doing to the upcoming Bitcoin
[56:46] policy summit uh that you have
[56:47] mentioned?
[56:49] Yeah. So, the the Bitcoin policy summit
[56:51] is this will be the third one. Um
[56:56] and the the first two years people kind
[57:00] of a lot of it had to be introductory um
[57:03] for everyone just not a lot of people
[57:05] who were attending knew about Bitcoin.
[57:07] The goal is to bring in people from
[57:10] relevant uh regulating agencies, SEC,
[57:14] CFTC,
[57:16] um consumer financial protection bureau,
[57:19] things like that, as well as uh Congress
[57:21] people, senators, staffers,
[57:25] um and educate them about Bitcoin. And
[57:29] so my co-authors and I have
[57:31] traditionally, I don't know if it'll be
[57:32] the same this year because we haven't
[57:33] totally settled in the schedule. We've
[57:35] traditionally gone first and talked
[57:37] about why there's a Bitcoin policy
[57:39] institute in addition to a um blockchain
[57:43] and a crypto and all these other think
[57:45] tanks. Um and our our job has been
[57:48] explain what sets Bitcoin apart. Uh and
[57:52] then once people understand why Bitcoin
[57:54] is special. It's not like these other um
[57:57] projects, then we sort of go into um
[58:01] things about regulatory frameworks and
[58:03] mining and and things like that. Um
[58:06] there will be, I'm sure, an increased
[58:08] focus this year on national security
[58:10] issues uh and and how Bitcoin relates to
[58:13] those and geopolitical tensions. Um, but
[58:16] we we've outgrown the venue that we've
[58:19] held it in the the last two years,
[58:21] partly because uh this administration's
[58:24] interest in Bitcoin has prompted other
[58:27] people to to get more interested in it
[58:29] to they they need to know what they're
[58:31] talking about. Um, and so yeah, June
[58:35] 24th and or 25th and 26th um will be the
[58:42] the Bitcoin Policy Summit in Washington
[58:44] DC at the Ronald Reagan um building
[58:47] hall, something like that, uh, in DC and
[58:51] we expect several thousand people to
[58:53] come and the goal is just to explain
[58:56] Bitcoin as well as we can explain why
[58:58] people use Bitcoin and what they're
[59:00] hoping to get out of it and how the the
[59:04] government can help people access the
[59:06] these individual liberties that come
[59:09] about as a result of Bitcoin. So, it's
[59:12] less an conference with Bitcoiners. It's
[59:15] more about an educational
[59:19] uh event for policy makers. Yes. Yes.
[59:23] Bitcoiners, people who are already
[59:24] Bitcoiners are not the audience. uh they
[59:27] are the the people up front and a lot of
[59:30] people who are who are are Bitcoiners
[59:33] come anyway because it's a chance to
[59:34] meet other Bitcoiners, talk to them,
[59:36] maybe tell your story to a senator or a
[59:40] staff member of a senator. Um so we do
[59:42] get a lot of people who come um just
[59:44] because they're they're interested in
[59:46] Bitcoin who are not, you know, part of
[59:48] the the policym side of things. uh a lot
[59:50] of journalists come because it's it's
[59:53] Washington DC and a lot of people who
[59:54] understand Bitcoin are converging in one
[59:56] place with the goal of explaining it.
[59:58] Yeah, I also saw uh the agenda and the
[60:01] the the speaker list for Bitcoin in Las
[60:04] Vegas. I will be there. It's pretty soon
[60:06] like it's it's just like uh two weeks or
[60:08] something like that. There are a lot of
[60:10] senators and a lot of politicians like
[60:12] of course Shady Vance the vice president
[60:14] and C Lumis those are kind of expected
[60:17] uh but like a lot of um uh politicians
[60:21] in general will be there. I was
[60:23] astonished by how many there are. Yeah.
[60:26] I I think Donald Trump's visit to
[60:29] Nashville last year showed
[60:33] politicians what can what good can come
[60:36] of talking to to Bitcoiners in in a
[60:39] language that they understand and
[60:40] appreciate. Um so I think some some of
[60:42] these people are clearly um just in it
[60:45] for the electoral advantages. Um Senator
[60:49] Lemus I I've now known for a couple
[60:52] years. Uh she wrote a very nice blurb
[60:54] for our book. Um, and I believe that
[60:58] that she believes many or most or maybe
[61:01] even all of of the same things about
[61:03] Bitcoin that I do. And so she's someone
[61:05] who I feel like actually understands it
[61:07] and was advocating for it long before it
[61:10] was politically advantageous. Um, in
[61:12] fact, when it was politically harmful,
[61:14] when it made her seem to to a lot of
[61:17] people to be crazy, why is she focusing
[61:18] on on this thing? It doesn't make any
[61:21] sense. Um, so yeah, I I have a lot of
[61:26] respect for how consistent she's been
[61:28] about her message around
[61:30] Bitcoin. I think it's the first time I
[61:33] heard her, was it 2023? Uh, the first
[61:36] time she's spoke out that I heard her. I
[61:39] don't know like when uh since when she
[61:40] is doing it, but yeah, she's she's been
[61:42] the longest one that I've known on on
[61:44] this political level. Yeah, I think it's
[61:47] it's at least been since 2022, and I I
[61:50] think even before that, that's when I
[61:51] first heard her talk about it. Um, and I
[61:54] think it's been even longer than that.
[61:57] Awesome. Wow. Uh, one one fun one last
[62:00] question. How much do you think Donald
[62:02] Trump understands Bitcoin outside of he
[62:05] needs it for for getting voted?
[62:08] I mean, I'm speculating, but sort of
[62:10] watching the video of him trying to uh
[62:13] buy a hamburger at Pupkkey in Bitcoin,
[62:16] um makes me think that he he doesn't
[62:18] really understand it at all. I think I
[62:21] think his kids might. Um Eric especially
[62:24] seems to. I think they also understand
[62:26] the value of being Bitcoin adjacent and
[62:29] using Bitcoin to then try to pitch World
[62:34] Liberty Financial and the Trump token
[62:36] and the Melania token. Um, I think they
[62:39] mostly see it as a place where money can
[62:41] be made, where votes can be gained and
[62:44] money can be made. Um I I'd love to be
[62:47] proved wrong about that, but that that's
[62:49] my suspicion um based on what I know
[62:52] about the Trump family and what they've
[62:54] said publicly. I mean, they're they're
[62:56] not weighing in on uh OP return limits
[62:59] and things like that. Um so I I I don't
[63:03] crazy. I love that. That would show me
[63:05] that they were actually intellectually
[63:07] invested in it. Um, and I I'm not
[63:10] convinced that they have lightning
[63:12] wallets, that they're running nodes at
[63:13] home, um, that they're in any way, you
[63:16] know, participating in the good of the
[63:19] Bitcoin network for the goods that it
[63:21] brings to other people. I think they're,
[63:23] at least so far, just interested in the
[63:25] goods that it brings to them. And
[63:26] they're not people who need it, right?
[63:28] They're people that can benefit from it,
[63:30] but they don't need it. They're they
[63:31] were doing fine before. They would be
[63:33] doing fine without. Imagine Donald Trump
[63:35] tweeting out like, "Keep the spam out"
[63:37] or something like that.
[63:41] Anti-ordin. That'd be amazing.
[63:44] Gosh, he he would Yeah, that would go
[63:48] wild in in Bitcoin. And outside of
[63:50] Bitcoin, nobody would understand what he
[63:52] actually means. Yeah.
[63:55] Um I have one question to ask each and
[63:57] every one of my guests and the question
[63:58] is um what can we learn from you besides
[64:01] Bitcoin? Well, I've I've written a book
[64:02] with uh one of my co-authors on the
[64:05] Bitcoin book that that's in philosophy
[64:06] of religion. Um so I write a lot of
[64:08] stuff in metaphysics and and philosophy
[64:11] of religion.
[64:13] Um I you know te teach a wide variety of
[64:18] uh courses uh teach philosophy and
[64:21] science fiction which is one of my
[64:22] favorite um courses to teach thinking
[64:24] about philosophical concepts like
[64:26] personal identity time uh time travel
[64:29] things like that through reading science
[64:32] fiction.
[64:33] Um,
[64:35] I roast coffee in my basement, so we
[64:38] could talk about coffee roasting uh
[64:41] profiles and things like that. Um, but
[64:43] yeah, mo most
[64:45] of you can go to bradleyer.com and I
[64:48] have links to to all the academic papers
[64:51] uh that I've written. Um, most of which
[64:53] aren't about Bitcoin. Um, really the the
[64:56] there's like two about cryptocurrency.
[64:58] Um, but then the big academic work on
[65:00] Bitcoin is is the book and then the
[65:02] podcasts and and things like that. Um,
[65:04] all my other academic stuff is is
[65:06] metaphysics and philosophy of religion.
[65:09] For me, Bitcoin is the closest thing
[65:11] that we can get to time travel.
[65:15] Yes. But always forward, never backward.
[65:19] True. Um, really cool. We have an end
[65:21] routine in the podcast where the
[65:23] previous guest is asking a question for
[65:24] the next guest without knowing who the
[65:26] next guest actually is. And the previous
[65:27] guest asked you the question, should
[65:29] people steer clear of Bitcoin treasury
[65:32] companies or and just buy Bitcoin? Um,
[65:36] so thinking of of Bitcoin treasury
[65:38] companies as companies um where the
[65:42] value proposition of the company is
[65:44] owning Bitcoin like uh I I can only
[65:47] speculate but I I would guess Bitcoin
[65:49] treasury companies uh companies that
[65:51] just have Bitcoin on their treasuries or
[65:53] balance sheet. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So,
[65:55] Micro Strategy, MetPlanet, things like
[65:57] that. Um, yeah, I mean, they offer
[66:00] different risk profiles, different
[66:02] return profiles.
[66:05] Um, I I don't have advice about that.
[66:08] Uh, all I would say is they're not the
[66:10] same thing. Uh, owning a Bitcoin
[66:12] treasury company is not the same as
[66:13] owning Bitcoin. Owning a Bitcoin ETF is
[66:15] not the same as as owning Bitcoin. Um,
[66:18] when you own Bitcoin, you can you can
[66:20] transfer it. you can uh transact
[66:23] peer-to-peer with it. You can audit your
[66:27] own amount of it and know that you have
[66:30] it. And none of these are are the case
[66:32] with Bitcoin Treasury companies or or
[66:34] with ETFs. So, um, on the other hand,
[66:38] uh, you don't have to worry about wrench
[66:41] attacks if you own these other things,
[66:44] um, and you're trusting someone else to
[66:47] to manage your access to the Bitcoin
[66:50] that they claim to have. So, um, I I
[66:54] would just say they're completely
[66:55] different things. That's like almost
[66:57] like asking, should I own a car or
[66:59] should I own stock in Toyota? Uh, it
[67:02] depends. do you need to drive or do you
[67:04] just want to make money? Um they're
[67:05] they're totally different to me. Uh and
[67:08] so if if you're just in it for uh number
[67:11] go up and increasing wealth, then you
[67:13] can think about it that way. U you know,
[67:15] nobody nobody in Zimbabwe is going to
[67:17] confuse these two things. Um owning
[67:20] Bitcoin treasury companies is not going
[67:21] to help them at all. Um same with people
[67:23] who are, you know, fighting
[67:24] authoritarianism in other countries. So
[67:27] uh I would just think of them as two
[67:28] completely different things.
[67:31] I like that answer a lot. Uh really
[67:33] really cool and I 100% agree with you.
[67:36] Um before I let you go, uh it was
[67:38] already really cool. Um where can people
[67:40] find you, ask your questions and and
[67:41] reach out to you? So I'm on Twitter,
[67:45] RettlerB. Um you can look up the the
[67:48] Bitcoin Research Institute. It's u
[67:52] wo.edu/bitcoin. Um the website for the
[67:55] book is resistance.money.
[67:58] The Bitcoin Policy Institute is
[68:01] btcpolicy.org and that's probably
[68:04] enough.
[68:06] There's a dot money. I love that. I
[68:08] didn't knew that. Interesting. Really,
[68:10] really cool. Thank you so much. Thank
[68:13] you so much, Pratt, for for taking the
[68:14] time. And also, thank you so much for
[68:16] everyone that is watching and listening,
[68:17] for joining us today. As always, I'll be
[68:19] back tomorrow with another episode.
[68:20] Bye-bye.
