[00:00] It's interesting. A lot of people in the
[00:02] Bitcoin space look at Mark Zuckerberg
[00:03] and Meta as perhaps the next to follow
[00:06] suit. And it's specifically because of
[00:07] what I mentioned where it's still a
[00:09] founder company and majority shareholder
[00:11] own companies and the individuals that
[00:13] find Bitcoin are the ones that are in
[00:15] the need to know. It's the companies who
[00:17] need a second chapter. They need a new
[00:19] way to fuel enterprise growth. Our goal
[00:22] is aligned with the company to grow
[00:23] their Bitcoin position and take the long
[00:26] time horizon view with them that that
[00:28] Bitcoin is going to appreciate over
[00:30] time. Early adopters of that get more of
[00:32] the love and appreciation from the
[00:34] Bitcoin community. And now it seems like
[00:36] every other day we're seeing a new
[00:38] company announce that they're adopting a
[00:40] Bitcoin treasury. And so some of the the
[00:42] marketing magic is wearing off. You can
[00:44] treat Bitcoin at fair value on your
[00:46] balance sheet. That's huge. That was
[00:48] only as of January 1st this year. So
[00:50] that that was a dealbreaker for most
[00:52] corporations to want to get into the
[00:54] space. These companies are basically
[00:56] looking to treat their entire treasury
[00:59] as Bitcoin as Bitcoin being their new
[01:02] hurdle rate for the incremental dollar
[01:04] that they would invest in a new line of
[01:06] business.
[01:09] [Music]
[01:11] Hi Chase, how you doing? Everything fine
[01:13] on your end? Yeah, doing great. Lovely
[01:15] to meet you. Really, really cool. Um may
[01:18] maybe before we get started um give the
[01:21] people some background who you are and
[01:23] and why are you excited about uh
[01:25] Bitcoin.
[01:26] So uh I'm kind of your entrepreneur
[01:30] operator. Uh my parents were serial
[01:32] entrepreneurs so I grew up helping them
[01:33] operate some businesses. Started a
[01:35] restaurant with my dad when I was 16.
[01:37] That that restaurant's now 19 years old.
[01:40] Uh got my degree in entrepreneurship,
[01:41] small business management. So background
[01:44] in economics, finance, accounting, all
[01:46] of that. Everything to do with starting
[01:48] and operating businesses from scratch.
[01:51] Uh ran a technology company that I
[01:52] founded out of college for about a
[01:54] decade called Critter that was in the
[01:56] online media space and have been kind of
[01:59] a a secret closeted Bitcoiner since
[02:01] 2016. Um, and you know, it was almost a
[02:05] distraction to running that business in
[02:07] a way cuz as you know, once the Bitcoin
[02:09] bug bites, it kind of uh takes over your
[02:12] intellectual curiosity. And then uh I
[02:15] reached out to the on-ramp and early
[02:17] riders folks in uh you know middle of
[02:20] last year and they were looking for
[02:22] somebody to come on as CEO for Acropolis
[02:24] where I am now the CEO which is a
[02:27] company that's helping simplify and
[02:29] scale corporate Bitcoin treasury
[02:31] adoption. Uh so that's the seat I'm in
[02:34] now and I'm helping get that business
[02:35] off the ground. Super interesting. Why
[02:38] why did you say secret Bitcoin or you
[02:40] you were you were not telling people or
[02:43] I was telling people near me of course
[02:45] because you don't want to have the
[02:46] survivor's guilt. You want to bring
[02:48] everyone along with you and and you know
[02:50] luckily a lot of the people around me
[02:53] and near near to me in my life uh
[02:55] followed suit and are pretty big Bitcoin
[02:58] and MSTR bag holders and so they're all
[03:00] very happy with me these days. But uh
[03:03] closeted in the sense that I was not
[03:04] public online. I was not tweeting about
[03:06] it. I was not posting about it. I I've
[03:10] been deep in the space for a while, but
[03:12] at the until I was working a job in a
[03:15] Bitcoin only company, it didn't make
[03:17] sense for me to be public facing. I just
[03:19] didn't want to worry about somebody
[03:21] knocking on my door, if you know what I
[03:22] mean. Interesting. So, you were worried
[03:24] that something happens uh when you're
[03:27] public persona and in Bitcoin also?
[03:31] Yeah, I was I'm always been pretty very
[03:34] easy to find and so I didn't want to
[03:36] also have that target on my head.
[03:39] Interesting. So, it was not about a
[03:41] business decision. You're like, "Okay,
[03:43] maybe I I lose a client or something."
[03:45] Uh or there's some other risk. You you
[03:47] were for your own security risk. Yeah.
[03:51] Just me and my wife and the family
[03:55] inside the house just not trying to call
[03:57] too much attention to ourselves at that
[03:58] moment in time. But now uh and and I
[04:01] think you're a fan of this form of
[04:02] custody as well. Now we use
[04:04] multi-institution custody. So you know
[04:07] most of our Bitcoin is held with three
[04:09] separate institutions that are all
[04:11] individual keyh holders. So no more kind
[04:14] of money at my fingertips per se, which
[04:16] puts uh a lot of us at ease.
[04:19] 100%. Uh it's it it's a thing that I
[04:23] always tell uh Bitcoiners that
[04:26] have an amount of Bitcoin that they
[04:28] really don't want to lose. Uh and could
[04:31] be an incentive for someone to take
[04:33] whatever the amount is. Uh maybe for
[04:36] someone at 0.1 Bitcoin, for someone it
[04:39] starts at one bitcoin, for someone it's
[04:40] maybe starts at 10 bitcoin. Whatever the
[04:42] amount is, you don't want that at home
[04:47] where you can access it.
[04:49] uh in in a short amount of time. You
[04:52] want to have it distant from you and as
[04:56] hard as possible but still available uh
[04:59] for you with some hoops. So if someone
[05:02] comes you can literally tell them I
[05:04] would love to give you your money but I
[05:07] physically can't. So you can kill me,
[05:10] you can torture me, but one thing I
[05:13] cannot do is give you my Bitcoin. I'm
[05:15] super sorry. Yeah. No, that's exactly
[05:18] right. With the Bitcoin that I do hold
[05:20] in self-custody, I have keys in
[05:22] different countries.
[05:24] Yeah, absolutely. That that makes a lot
[05:25] of sense. Um, but let's talk talk about
[05:28] Bitcoin as as a treasury asset for
[05:33] companies.
[05:34] Um, let let's start with a little bit of
[05:37] of of history. How did this get started?
[05:39] because I think like 2020 was was kind
[05:41] of the the starting point with with with
[05:43] Micro Strategy with the first public
[05:45] traded company and and how did did we
[05:48] come here? How early are we and and what
[05:51] kind of your is your understanding of of
[05:53] the state of Bitcoin Treasury uh that we
[05:56] are currently in? Yeah. So I actually
[05:59] had Bitcoin Treasury for um some of our
[06:02] family businesses dating back to 2018.
[06:05] So got into Bitcoin 2016, orangepilled
[06:08] my dad and and other family members
[06:10] sufficiently by 2018 so that we could
[06:12] take some of the family business and use
[06:15] a Bitcoin treasury. But at the time it
[06:17] was very difficult. Um, you know, if you
[06:20] don't have an avid and somewhat
[06:22] technical Bitcoiner in your life to help
[06:25] you with that, basically your own
[06:27] Bitcoin strategy officer, then it's
[06:29] really hard to execute on that in a way
[06:31] that is secure, responsible, in a
[06:34] riskmanaged way that doesn't risk the
[06:36] operating business. So, um, Mason
[06:40] Carter, my co-founder at Acropolis and
[06:42] principal at Early Writers, uh, he
[06:45] started Acropolis, uh, middle of last
[06:48] year with, like I said, the mission of
[06:50] simplifying and scaling Bitcoin
[06:52] corporate treasury adoption. And so,
[06:55] we've been at it since then. And uh and
[06:58] yeah, the reason why Bitcoin makes sense
[07:00] as a modern treasury reserve asset is
[07:03] because everything else, all the
[07:05] traditional treasury assets fail to keep
[07:07] pace with inflation. So if you're living
[07:09] amongst inflationary times, your your
[07:11] real rate of return is not keeping up
[07:14] with the, you know, stated CPI. And so,
[07:17] uh, there's all these other properties
[07:19] that Bitcoin represents on the balance
[07:21] sheet. Things like its 247 global
[07:23] liquidity. Um the fact that any holder
[07:26] who's held for four years or more is uh
[07:29] in the profit. Um the fact that there's
[07:31] no CEO, no marketing team, no product
[07:33] roadmap, you know, there's not going to
[07:35] be any scandals because the Bitcoin CEO
[07:38] got caught up in something. And
[07:40] companies themselves have this uh this
[07:43] regulation where they can't hold uh up
[07:45] to 40% of their balance sheet in
[07:47] securities or they'll be deemed an
[07:49] investment fund. And so it even things
[07:51] like the IBIT spot Bitcoin ETF doesn't
[07:55] make sense for a company that they're
[07:56] going to have to learn how to hold spot
[07:58] Bitcoin if they ever want to hold more
[07:59] than 40% of their balance
[08:01] sheet. That's an interesting insight. I
[08:04] never I didn't knew that that that you
[08:06] cannot hold more than 40% of securities.
[08:10] So, but you can hold 100% of of your
[08:13] treasury in Bitcoin if you hold them in
[08:15] in self custody. That's right. Yeah.
[08:18] because Bitcoin is a commodity. Uh you
[08:20] know, you can hold as much of it as you
[08:22] want and you can even go past 100% if
[08:24] you're somebody like Michael Sailor and
[08:26] Micro Strategy and you want to lever up.
[08:29] Absolutely. I want to come to Micro
[08:30] Strategy a little bit later because it's
[08:32] just so fascinating. I I remember those
[08:35] times when I was like, "Oh, they were at
[08:37] like 100,000 Bitcoin and I was like,
[08:39] will they ever get to 1% of the
[08:40] supplies?" So like 210,000 and now we're
[08:43] over 500,000. And it's it's not that
[08:46] long ago then. that that you talked
[08:48] about that like literally they started
[08:51] just 2020 so that's not even I think not
[08:54] not even five years in it's it's it's
[08:56] really fast how they did it um but first
[08:59] I want to talk about um maybe related to
[09:03] that why not more companies do that
[09:06] micro strategy has been around for
[09:08] almost 5 years now uh they have done it
[09:11] really good in the public eye uh then
[09:13] there are multiple companies that kind
[09:16] of followed suit that also doing really
[09:18] great. Then of course there are like
[09:20] private companies as you as you said and
[09:22] and as you done uh in in the private
[09:24] sector that have made that strategy al
[09:27] also already beforehand. So there are
[09:30] examples and playbooks and also the
[09:33] regulatory framework seems to be more
[09:35] and more favorable now. Why aren't more
[09:38] companies uh doing that now? Yeah, all
[09:41] the regulatory hurdles um are out of the
[09:44] way now. things like the Fazby rule
[09:46] changing where uh you can treat Bitcoin
[09:48] at fair value on your balance sheet.
[09:50] That's huge. That was only as of January
[09:53] 1st this year. So that that was a
[09:55] dealbreaker for most corporations to
[09:57] want to get into the space. But the
[09:59] reason that we can look at Michael
[10:01] Sailor and Micro Strategy or you know
[10:03] Simler Scientific and some of these
[10:05] other companies is ultimately that they
[10:07] didn't have to do the consensus building
[10:09] in the same way that a typical
[10:11] corporation does. Michael Sailor is
[10:13] still a founder, you know, he's leading
[10:15] a founder-ledd company at Strategy. He's
[10:18] majority shareholder. So, if he's
[10:20] sufficiently uh an orange pill in his
[10:23] own life, he can pull the company in
[10:25] whatever direction he wants. Now,
[10:27] obviously, there's some level of
[10:28] investor relations and corporate
[10:30] communication and and stakeholder
[10:31] engagement to get everybody aligned on
[10:33] the strategy so that you're not scaring
[10:35] folks out of your stock or or you know,
[10:38] running, you know, high highly talented
[10:40] employees out of your business. So, you
[10:42] do want to communicate the plan, but to
[10:45] some degree, you know, Michael Sailor
[10:46] could have executed on this without
[10:48] anybody else's input or approval. And
[10:52] the reason that we don't see more public
[10:55] companies doing that is simply there's
[10:56] not that many other public companies
[10:58] that are still founderled majority
[11:00] shareholder owned. Usually when you're a
[11:02] public company, the the shareholder base
[11:05] is become distributed enough that you
[11:08] know the founder is is more you know
[11:11] operating the business on behalf of
[11:13] shareholders and uh has to deal with a
[11:17] board of directors of you know seven
[11:19] nine people that they need to kind of
[11:22] have sign off on anything that would be
[11:24] this this kind of new from a strategy
[11:27] standpoint. So we see a lot more success
[11:30] with middlesized large private companies
[11:33] where the CEO is, you know, still
[11:36] basically uh the dictator within that
[11:39] organization and they're orange pill in
[11:41] their own lives, have Bitcoin on their
[11:43] personal balance sheet and those are the
[11:45] folks that can really take the decisive
[11:47] action and move the company into a
[11:49] Bitcoin treasury strategy in a matter of
[11:52] just weeks.
[11:54] Yeah, it's the it's super interesting
[11:57] with Micro Strategy and there aren't
[11:59] that many big companies that are found
[12:02] on that. I I always look at Facebook as
[12:05] an interesting example. I mean Mark
[12:07] Zuckerberg could be someone that is into
[12:10] Bitcoin and not be super vocal about it.
[12:13] He made some tweet I think like and not
[12:17] not tweet Facebook post in 2021 uh
[12:20] around his goats that he calls Maxi and
[12:23] and Bitcoin. Um so he he definitely has
[12:27] like there's no way he does not have
[12:29] Bitcoin and he could I think uh from the
[12:32] shareholder uh perspective probably move
[12:35] Facebook in that direction. I don't know
[12:37] how exactly it it it looks. Um, is that
[12:41] your best guess of what company will
[12:45] actually adopt will first adopt a real
[12:47] Bitcoin strategy or is there some other
[12:49] company that you look at? I mean,
[12:51] there's Tesla obviously with 10,000
[12:53] Bitcoin, but I don't know if that's a
[12:56] real Bitcoin strategy. It's probably too
[13:00] too The amount is not high enough for it
[13:03] to count in in in my eyes. I mean,
[13:06] 10,000 Bitcoin is a lot of Bitcoin, but
[13:08] but not for for Tesla. Yeah, it's
[13:12] interesting. A lot of people in the
[13:13] Bitcoin space look at Mark Zuckerberg
[13:15] and Meta as perhaps the next to follow
[13:18] suit. And it's specifically because of
[13:19] what I mentioned where it's still a
[13:21] founder company and majority shareholder
[13:23] owned because for example uh you have
[13:25] Tim Cook the CEO of Apple who's publicly
[13:28] stated that he owns Bitcoin and believes
[13:30] in its long-term potential but it you
[13:32] know he Tim Cook does not have the
[13:34] majority shareholder or founder ethos to
[13:38] kind of lead the company in that
[13:39] strategy. So, we don't hear many people
[13:41] talking about Apple even though they
[13:43] have the most cash on their balance
[13:45] sheet out of I think any company in the
[13:47] world. So, do I think Mark Zuckerberg
[13:50] will be the next to do it? Uh, I
[13:53] actually don't. I think that you're
[13:55] going to see more things like Micro
[13:56] Strategy and GameStop and companies that
[13:59] have essentially stalled out on growth
[14:01] and are hesitant to invest in new
[14:04] product lines, new markets because
[14:06] they're, you know, they they have cash
[14:08] on hand. they have a decent treasury,
[14:10] but they they don't necessarily believe
[14:12] that the next product line they're going
[14:14] to create is going to generate the
[14:16] return on that investment that, you
[14:18] know, they would like and definitely not
[14:20] one that would at least keep pace with
[14:22] Bitcoin's compound annual growth rate.
[14:24] So, and Michael Sailor says this a lot.
[14:27] Basically, the the companies and the
[14:29] individuals that find Bitcoin are the
[14:30] ones that are in the need to know. It's
[14:33] the companies who need a second chapter.
[14:35] they need a new way to fuel enterprise
[14:38] growth. Those are the companies that
[14:40] start looking for solutions to a
[14:42] problem. It's the the Mag 7 that, you
[14:46] know, they're doing just fine. You know,
[14:48] they're they're doing well with the
[14:49] strategy that's in place. They can kind
[14:51] of just keep operating on their existing
[14:53] road maps, not deviate from course too
[14:55] much, and they're they're doing quite
[14:57] well in the public market, so they don't
[14:59] need it.
[15:00] It's so interesting because they have
[15:02] such a huge pile of cash. They It would
[15:07] be so easy for them to really
[15:09] accelerate. Um, I mean, I guess they
[15:11] they they might just trigger some some
[15:14] real the I just have in my head, what if
[15:18] Apple really comes out of on an earnings
[15:20] call, yes, we will deploy 5% of our
[15:23] balance sheet into Bitcoin, which which
[15:25] would be so huge because 5% of the
[15:27] balance sheet is just like such a huge
[15:29] amount of cash. That ripple effect that
[15:32] all of a sudden everyone will ask the
[15:35] Alphabet uh board members, oh, like what
[15:38] are you doing? Then all of a sudden,
[15:40] Meta and and then Amazon and then all
[15:42] those those it seems like the the the
[15:47] big seven or like even let's can even
[15:50] say the big 50 or whatever companies
[15:53] that are in those pallets if like one
[15:56] solid one is really going after
[15:58] something uh and and announcing it in a
[16:01] in a real manner of like oh we we have
[16:04] 5% of balance sheet now for from now on
[16:08] into the future always in Bitcoin or
[16:09] let's say 10% or something like that.
[16:12] That that would be that would be huge.
[16:15] Yeah. And we saw GameStop, which you
[16:17] know is nothing compared to the balance
[16:18] sheet of an Apple or these other Mac 7,
[16:21] but the companies that are announcing
[16:23] Bitcoin treasuries are getting bigger
[16:25] and bigger. There's and they're getting
[16:27] uh more conviction around the percentage
[16:29] to allocate too, right? It's not just a
[16:32] one to two% allocation. These companies
[16:35] are basically looking to treat their
[16:37] entire treasury as Bitcoin. As Bitcoin
[16:41] being their new hurdle rate for the
[16:43] incremental dollar that they would
[16:45] invest in a new line of business. How do
[16:48] you look at actually GameStop? It's it's
[16:50] such an amazing story. A dying dying
[16:55] company that got saved by some meme kind
[16:59] of and and now maybe gets a second life,
[17:03] a huge second life of Bitcoin. It's
[17:06] funny. It's in a way it was the the
[17:09] short sellers who gave it life, right?
[17:11] because they shorted the company so much
[17:14] that there became this opportunity for
[17:16] the re retail crowd to kind of use that
[17:19] levered position against them and
[17:21] revitalize the stock. So, uh yeah, it's
[17:24] an interesting story. I'm not a holder
[17:27] of GameStop because um you know
[17:30] personally I think Micro Strategy kind
[17:32] of has the runaway network effects and
[17:34] they're going to have greater volatility
[17:36] and and I just don't think any other
[17:38] company is ever going to catch the
[17:40] number of Bitcoin that Micro Strategy
[17:42] holds. But it's um you know it's still
[17:45] yet to be seen. We we actually haven't
[17:47] seen GameStop announce their first buy
[17:49] yet. And I think it's kind of funny
[17:51] because uh I think a lot of the
[17:53] shareholders were hoping that they were
[17:55] in market buying during this recent dip,
[17:57] but you know, now we're back up to 93
[18:00] 94K. So uh it'll be interesting to see
[18:03] if Ryan Cohen and the team executed on
[18:06] the the Bitcoin purchase or if they were
[18:09] still trying to get their ducks in a
[18:10] line because that's the other thing. The
[18:12] larger the company you are, the longer
[18:14] it takes, the more boxes you have to
[18:16] check with compliance and and
[18:18] communicating the strategy beforehand.
[18:20] And and a public company has to
[18:22] communicate that they're going to go out
[18:23] and buy Bitcoin. And by the time that
[18:26] they go out to buy Bitcoin, the price
[18:27] might have run away. They might have
[18:29] signaled to the market like if you said
[18:31] like what you said with Apple signaling
[18:34] that they're going to have to they're
[18:35] going to go buy 5% of their balance
[18:37] sheet into Bitcoin. the second they make
[18:40] that announcement, the price might be up
[18:42] 50% and then it might take them two
[18:45] months before they can actually deploy
[18:46] capital. And so the price has been
[18:48] running away from them for 2 months when
[18:50] they finally actually start to put money
[18:52] into the into their Bitcoin position. So
[18:56] there's a real disadvantage in some ways
[18:57] to the public companies. If you're not
[18:59] going to issue stock to buy Bitcoin, if
[19:01] you're not going to tap the capital
[19:02] markets and you're just going to purely
[19:04] take the cash on your balance sheet to
[19:06] buy Bitcoin, there's almost an advantage
[19:08] to the private company who can do this
[19:10] quietly and accumulate a stack and then
[19:12] announce it after the fact. So, Apple
[19:16] and I have no rule no clue about the
[19:18] rules for public trading companies.
[19:19] Apples would have to announce that they
[19:23] will going to do that before they can
[19:26] actually do that. So they cannot buy 5%
[19:29] of the balance sheet with Bitcoin and
[19:31] then announce hey we bought 5% of the
[19:33] balance sheet with Bitcoin. You know
[19:35] it's it's a good question like do they
[19:38] technically have to signal that strategy
[19:42] change? I think so. But even if they
[19:44] didn't they would feel the need to
[19:47] communicate the plan to shareholders
[19:49] because what they don't want is to
[19:50] surprise shareholders. That's maybe one
[19:53] of the reasons that these companies like
[19:56] the Mag 7, which are basically treated
[19:58] like savings accounts for, you know,
[20:00] people's retirement income at this time
[20:03] at this point. Um, what they're really
[20:06] trying to do is not surprise the market
[20:08] because they understand that they're
[20:10] being traded they're they're being
[20:11] treated as the piggy bank for, you know,
[20:14] basically every retail investor, pension
[20:17] fund, etc. So their goal is not to shock
[20:20] the market because uh they don't want
[20:22] the volatility in the share price that
[20:24] Micro Strategy is is purposefully
[20:26] manifesting. It's so sad. It's so sad
[20:29] because the stocks are now treated as
[20:32] savings vehicles which shouldn't be
[20:35] there. And because of that dynamic now
[20:38] companies have to make decisions to not
[20:41] rock the boat. But as a business you
[20:43] have to rock your own boat to be be a
[20:46] business also in the future. not just
[20:48] now because business are always evolving
[20:50] and there's always something new coming
[20:52] and if you're not adopting a new
[20:54] strategy you you will be left behind.
[20:57] That's a I I never never looked at that
[20:59] way of the the company also having to
[21:02] look out for their shareholders because
[21:05] they treat it as a as a as a savings
[21:09] vehicle and they might be not okay with
[21:11] a 10% drop even though it's a great
[21:14] strategy for the long run.
[21:16] Yeah, it's it is sad and it's it's also
[21:19] really kind of a commentary on the
[21:22] quality of the savings technologies that
[21:24] we have in the market precoitcoin that
[21:26] we were treating companies as savings
[21:30] accounts, treating public company
[21:32] equities as if they can never go down.
[21:34] And then when you do see down days, you
[21:37] see the entire American voting public
[21:40] basically begging uh Washington DC to
[21:43] bail out uh or change course on tariff
[21:46] talks to make sure that their five or 4%
[21:49] dip in their savings account which are
[21:52] public equities uh that those can
[21:54] recover because they really treat they
[21:56] people are investing in the S&P 500
[21:59] today as if it is as if it can only go
[22:02] up and uh that's very scary in a world
[22:05] where Bitcoin automation and AI uh can
[22:08] disrupt these companies that are also at
[22:11] really really outrageous um price to
[22:14] earnings multiples. You know, I think
[22:17] Nvidia sometimes hits like 200 years
[22:20] worth of annual revenue as their
[22:23] valuation. So, you'd have to hold you'd
[22:25] have to hope that that company can
[22:27] maintain that level of revenue for 200
[22:29] years to pull in the value of its market
[22:32] cap. that seems unlikely. So interesting
[22:36] because you brought up tariffs. I I just
[22:38] want to show that uh to people quickly
[22:40] on the on on the screen and it's so
[22:42] fascinating also how the mainstream
[22:45] media not only in America I guess but I
[22:47] saw it from the Austrian uh and the
[22:49] European mainstream media. We basically
[22:52] that's the S&P 500 year to date. So from
[22:54] January 2nd to what we have here 23rd of
[22:58] of April. Um, and we had that short
[23:02] shock here. I mean shock like it's 11%.
[23:06] Yes, it's uh it's quite some quite some
[23:10] percentage for an S&P 500 which is
[23:12] supposed to be the savings vehicle which
[23:14] it isn't obviously. And I seen the
[23:18] mainstream media react as if there would
[23:21] be an an epidemic in America that is
[23:26] kind of rotting out 50% of the
[23:28] population. It's it's like the the world
[23:30] is going down. It's like everything is
[23:33] breaking down. Like the whole world is
[23:35] collapsing because Donald Trump is is
[23:38] putting tariffs on and the stock market
[23:40] is is like 10% down which is laughable.
[23:44] And it shows how uh how insecure people
[23:47] are about their finances because they
[23:49] haven't really
[23:51] investigated what money is and and how
[23:53] they should treat their own savings.
[23:56] Yeah. And these are 500 companies that
[23:59] all can dilute their shareholders,
[24:01] right? They can all issue new shares. So
[24:05] the world basically treats the S&P 500
[24:07] as their piggy bank, but it's not a hard
[24:10] asset. There is no true scarcity. uh you
[24:13] know these companies can print equity
[24:15] shares to do things like buy Bitcoin or
[24:18] you know make a uh a acquisition or
[24:21] merge with another entity. There's
[24:23] there's a lot of things that they can do
[24:24] and they're printing shares constantly.
[24:26] So uh it's it's kind of scary how much
[24:29] the world thinks that the S&P 500 is
[24:32] their piggy bank with the printing their
[24:34] own shares. I never 100% understood that
[24:38] because for me it's like they can only
[24:41] give out shares that are existing. May
[24:45] maybe I have not enough knowledge around
[24:47] that. It's like cannot can they have
[24:50] over 100% of of the company shares or
[24:53] like how does it work? So you would have
[24:56] kind of a in your articles of
[24:58] incorporation, you'd have a certain
[24:59] number of shares, call it a million
[25:01] shares, and then you would distribute
[25:02] those out to the founding team, maybe
[25:04] some advisors,
[25:06] uh you set them aside for investors,
[25:09] maybe even set aside a pool for future
[25:12] employees, but you can always issue new
[25:14] shares. So if you think of a startup
[25:16] that does, you know, a seed round,
[25:18] they're issuing new shares to new
[25:20] investors, right? And then they do a
[25:22] series A round. They're issuing new
[25:23] shares to new investors. Now, they're
[25:25] hoping that the total value of the
[25:28] enterprise is going up fast enough that
[25:30] the share price is maintaining its
[25:32] current price or increasing in price.
[25:35] But companies are constantly issuing new
[25:37] shares, diluting the existing holders uh
[25:40] in order to bring in more outside
[25:42] capital. This is one of the things that
[25:44] we find really interesting at Acropolis
[25:46] is the the startup use case for Bitcoin
[25:49] on the treasury. So if you imagine a
[25:51] company goes and raises a series A
[25:53] round, they raise $5 million, they need
[25:56] to deploy $1.5 million over the next 18
[26:00] months and the rest of it is really just
[26:02] kind of cash on hand. If they put that
[26:06] into Bitcoin and they run a lean
[26:08] operation, by the time that they would
[26:10] have otherwise needed to go out and
[26:12] raise a series B and dilute the
[26:14] ownership even further, which is also a
[26:17] huge time sync and distraction for the
[26:18] executive team to be fundraising, if
[26:21] instead they were holding Bitcoin and
[26:23] Bitcoin appreciated, they might never
[26:25] have to raise capital again. they get to
[26:27] maintain the ownership at the point of
[26:29] that last round and they get to get back
[26:32] to focusing on their operating business
[26:34] instead of you know constantly worrying
[26:36] about which milestone and story they
[26:38] need to create in the market so they can
[26:41] go successfully raise the next round of
[26:43] capital. So uh yeah it's uh you can
[26:47] always print more shares in the company.
[26:49] Um, and the only time that it maybe
[26:52] makes sense is if you are accreing, and
[26:55] this is something that's interesting
[26:56] about Micro Strategy, is it's what they
[26:59] kind of call accretive dilution. They're
[27:01] they're diluting their shareholders with
[27:03] more shares, but they are accreing more
[27:07] Bitcoin per share faster than the share
[27:11] increase. So, when they dilute the
[27:13] shareholders, those shareholders are
[27:16] actually getting more Bitcoin per share
[27:18] over time. That's what makes Micro
[27:20] Strategy's story so interesting.
[27:23] Super
[27:25] interesting.
[27:26] That's it's it's really weird that they
[27:29] can print down because I always thought
[27:31] like you you buy shares and you have a
[27:33] percentage of the business and then you
[27:35] just have the percentage of a business
[27:36] and they cannot dilute that percentage.
[27:38] But what you're saying is basically you
[27:40] don't really have that percentage and
[27:42] they can dilute your percentage with
[27:44] with making more shares.
[27:47] Uh that seems stupid. Yeah, there's only
[27:50] ever 100% of the company, but if you own
[27:53] 5% of the business and then I go you and
[27:56] we raise a a round of capital and a
[27:59] million dollars comes into the business.
[28:01] Well, you're dilution you you might have
[28:03] been diluted from 5% to 3 12% of the
[28:06] business because we had to give away
[28:08] some new shares to the uh the investors.
[28:12] Then then that that's why founders
[28:14] typically start with maybe 50% of their
[28:18] business and then if you look at most
[28:20] public companies CEOs, they end up
[28:22] owning maybe 7 to 12 15% of their
[28:25] business once they get all the way
[28:27] through the funding rounds into IPO.
[28:30] Uh that's uh that's interesting. Yeah.
[28:34] Makes stock investing even less less
[28:37] less appealing now. Well, and it tells
[28:40] you why there's so few Michael Sailors
[28:42] out there who are still majority
[28:43] shareholder owners of their business is
[28:45] because to get all the way through, you
[28:48] know, many years of operating the
[28:50] business, many funding rounds, all the
[28:51] way through to IPO, it's very hard for
[28:54] the founder to maintain the majority
[28:57] shareholder ownership of the business.
[29:00] Absolutely. Yeah. Um, you said something
[29:02] before um that that stuck with me. You
[29:06] said Bitcoin strategy officer. Is that
[29:08] is that a real thing in in a company
[29:10] already? Uh and and shouldn't that be
[29:12] the the CFO?
[29:14] Dylan has kind of pioneered that that
[29:17] role. Um and I think it makes sense. I
[29:20] you know ultimately I think every
[29:22] company will hold Bitcoin and so every
[29:24] company will either have an in-house
[29:26] Bitcoin strategy officer or a outsourced
[29:30] Bitcoin treasury team. Um, and so that's
[29:33] becoming a modern role for obviously a
[29:37] Bitcoin treasury companies only. If
[29:39] you're not holding Bitcoin, it doesn't
[29:40] make sense. But if you are, Bitcoin does
[29:43] have these unique properties that are
[29:44] different than the treasury bills or
[29:46] cash in your bank account. And so it
[29:47] does take somebody with some Bitcoin
[29:49] expertise. And believe it or not, you
[29:52] know, the only thing as scarce as
[29:53] Bitcoin right now are Bitcoiners with
[29:56] corporate finance backgrounds that want
[29:59] to help, you know, other companies move
[30:01] in this direction.
[30:04] That that that's true. Yeah. There's not
[30:06] I mean they they're getting more, but I
[30:08] think the demand for them is is getting
[30:10] faster and and and more than they
[30:12] actually getting more. Defin definitely
[30:15] the demand is outpacing the individuals
[30:18] because fiat world is also really
[30:20] attractive right a lot of these
[30:21] corporate finance professionals
[30:23] investment professionals they're making
[30:26] great money and they're converting that
[30:28] those paychecks into Bitcoin on in their
[30:30] personal lives. Um, so there's, you
[30:32] know, you have to really want to be
[30:34] full-time team Bitcoin to make the leap
[30:37] from fiat world into Bitcoin only
[30:40] because they couldn't make more money
[30:42] being in the fiat world and just or and
[30:45] just stacking Bitcoin. Yeah. Yeah. Doing
[30:48] it for their personal lives rather than
[30:49] for a startup or a business for example.
[30:52] Yeah. And you you could get paid like if
[30:55] you're a Bitcoin strategy officer, I'm
[30:56] sure to some degree, Dylan is being paid
[31:00] out in large part through equity, right?
[31:03] So he's probably getting paid out in
[31:05] shares of MetaPlanet to align uh the
[31:07] value that you know he's creating over
[31:10] there. Um, but you know, and that's
[31:13] probably a good use case for Bitcoin
[31:15] strategy officers in the future when
[31:17] they join a company, they get paid in
[31:19] stock, so they can go aggressive to try
[31:22] to grow the share price of that stock
[31:23] through Bitcoin acquisition. That might
[31:26] be a way that you can kind of
[31:27] incentivize people from the fiat world
[31:30] to join these smaller companies and and
[31:32] take on the Bitcoin treasury role. Let's
[31:34] take a break for a moment and appreciate
[31:37] the beauty that Coin Vigilante has made
[31:40] with the Bitcoin watches. Those watches
[31:42] are the most amazing, the most eleigent
[31:45] way of showing that you are a true
[31:48] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[31:51] dropped a completely new and amazing
[31:53] Genesis edition of their watch
[31:56] collections. You have the date of the
[31:58] first ever mined Bitcoin block in there
[32:02] and of course also the block height and
[32:04] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[32:08] the level of detail they put in in this
[32:10] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[32:13] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[32:16] down in the descriptions. I love those
[32:18] watches so so much. And now if you have
[32:21] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[32:24] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[32:26] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[32:28] to deal with that. The first way is you
[32:30] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[32:33] entry for you to get into the
[32:35] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[32:38] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[32:41] super simple and secure way. And if you
[32:44] check out the link in the description,
[32:46] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[32:49] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[32:52] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[32:55] partner in terms of how to get the most
[32:58] out of your sovereignty. They will
[33:00] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[33:03] that is perfect for your individual
[33:06] situation. They will show you how you
[33:09] can secure your own devices. Securing
[33:12] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[33:13] have to keep all your devices secure.
[33:16] One topic that is overlooked often is
[33:18] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[33:21] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[33:24] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[33:26] place already? And last but not least,
[33:28] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[33:30] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[33:33] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[33:38] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[33:41] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[33:44] be for the first time ever speaking at
[33:46] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[33:49] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[33:52] really looking forward to seeing all of
[33:53] you there. You can get your ticket in
[33:56] the link down in the description of
[33:58] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[34:00] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[34:04] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[34:06] there. I love when people get uh paid in
[34:11] what they actually delivering to the
[34:13] company. I I I love that model always. I
[34:15] was always a big fan fan of that getting
[34:18] paid by what you bring and not for your
[34:21] time.
[34:23] Definitely. Yeah. The eat what you kill
[34:25] model. What we do at Acropolis that's
[34:27] kind of interesting is when we custody
[34:29] Bitcoin for our clients, we charge basis
[34:32] points on the amount in custody. So our
[34:35] goal is aligned with the company to grow
[34:37] their Bitcoin position and take the long
[34:40] time horizon view with them that that
[34:43] Bitcoin is going to appreciate over time
[34:44] and we participate in the upside with
[34:46] the client. So so super aligned there
[34:49] and we're not actually adding any new
[34:51] overhead costs to the business.
[34:54] You also said something that is more and
[34:56] more in in the words of people that talk
[35:00] about Bitcoin and corporate treasury.
[35:02] It's Bitcoin per share. For the people
[35:04] that that don't know about it, what is
[35:07] it and why is it important? Yeah. So, we
[35:10] actually put out about a month ago the
[35:12] world's first Bitcoin per share
[35:14] calculator. So, it's a calculator where
[35:17] you can if you're a company, you can
[35:19] look at, okay, I raised if I raise, you
[35:22] know, X amount of debt and use it to buy
[35:25] Bitcoin, how will that change the amount
[35:28] of Bitcoin per share in my company? Or
[35:31] if I raise an equity round and I use it
[35:34] to deploy into Bitcoin, how will that
[35:36] change the amount of Bitcoin uh per
[35:38] share? So, for example, if you buy Micro
[35:42] Strategy, Yep, there it is. It's pretty
[35:45] pretty neat tool. Um the first of its
[35:48] kind there. And so if you buy Micro
[35:50] Strategy, you can actually work through
[35:52] the numbers and say, "Okay, Micro
[35:54] Strategy has so many shares and they
[35:57] have so many Bitcoin. So if I just
[35:59] divide uh you know those two numbers, I
[36:02] can find out how much Bitcoin is
[36:05] represented inside of each share. And
[36:08] then you can track that over time. As
[36:09] they create more shares, they're
[36:12] diluting you. But if they're acquiring
[36:14] Bitcoin more quickly than they're
[36:15] creating new shares, then you're
[36:17] actually getting more Bitcoin per share
[36:20] every time that they uh issue new shares
[36:23] to buy Bitcoin. So this is a yeah a neat
[36:26] tool where any company can basically say
[36:29] okay I'm thinking about raising an
[36:30] equity round or or a debt round but I
[36:33] want to make sure that I am making it
[36:35] accretive to the Bitcoin per share and
[36:38] that we're moving forward not backwards
[36:40] and uh this is a really quick free open
[36:43] source tool to do that.
[36:45] That's really cool. I I like that. And
[36:49] it's it's also basically um uh just so
[36:51] you know very easily to find. And I just
[36:53] put Bitcoin perch calculator out and it
[36:55] was like the fifth site or something
[36:57] like that. So you did a good job also
[36:59] the search engine optimization there.
[37:02] Yeah, we're getting better at that.
[37:04] Yeah.
[37:05] Really cool. Um what is Bitcoin yield?
[37:08] Is that how many more Bitcoin you've
[37:11] accumulated? Yeah. So that's exactly
[37:14] right. Um that's the metric that Micro
[37:16] Strategy likes to talk about the most.
[37:19] um because you can be accreating Bitcoin
[37:21] per share but what really matters is the
[37:25] Bitcoin yield gives you kind of a more
[37:27] holistic view at that so that you can
[37:29] create like an annual Bitcoin yield. So
[37:32] you can say hey shareholder base this
[37:35] year we grew Bitcoin yield by 15%. So
[37:39] you know every share got 15% more
[37:43] Bitcoin represented in that share by the
[37:46] end of the year. So it's similar
[37:49] to because individuals don't have
[37:51] individual shares. It's it's similar to
[37:54] saying hey I started with 1 million
[37:56] Satoshi and at the end of the year I
[37:58] have 2 million Satoshi then I grew the
[38:01] Bitcoin yield my personal Bitcoin yield
[38:03] 100% because I I I basically 2xed but
[38:07] for a company broken down per
[38:10] outstanding share. Yeah. Except the
[38:13] difference is that when you buy a share
[38:15] of Micro Strategy, you never you don't
[38:18] have to put more money in to get that
[38:20] Bitcoin yield. It's their operation that
[38:22] is creating that. So, they're basically
[38:26] creating more Bitcoin in your share for
[38:29] you. there that you can think of it as
[38:31] like a them buying the dips on your
[38:34] behalf or them dcaing more Bitcoin into
[38:36] your share uh on a weekly basis because
[38:39] they make their buys basically weekly at
[38:41] this point. And so yeah, you're getting
[38:44] more Bitcoin out of that share without
[38:46] ever having to put up more money.
[38:48] Whereas in as an individual, you know,
[38:51] one Bitcoin is one Bitcoin. So if you
[38:52] buy one Bitcoin and you want to get it
[38:55] to 1.06 06 Bitcoin. Uh the only way
[38:58] you're going to do that is by coming up
[38:59] with more cash to buy more Bitcoin with.
[39:01] Whereas when you buy Micro Strategy
[39:03] stock, the Bitcoin is actually
[39:05] increasing over time without you having
[39:07] to come up with more cash. Super
[39:09] interesting. I I I love that you open
[39:11] source that tool also and and put it out
[39:13] there for for free. Uh I also love that
[39:17] uh because some people like to do that
[39:19] like there's a calculator and then you
[39:20] have to put in your email to get
[39:22] results. You put it the other way
[39:23] around. So you you put in the things,
[39:26] you get the results, and you can choose
[39:27] to give the email on the I like that
[39:31] approach a lot. Yeah, thank you. Yeah,
[39:33] we're we're trying to do everything we
[39:34] can, like I said, I've probably said the
[39:36] mission three times now, but it's maybe
[39:38] worth repeating, to simplify and scale
[39:40] corporate Bitcoin treasury adoption
[39:42] worldwide. And the way to do that is to
[39:44] take the tools that we're working with
[39:46] our clients on and open source them as
[39:49] much as possible. So whether that's
[39:50] research, playbooks, calculator tools
[39:53] like this, on that same page, you'd
[39:55] actually see that there's a Bitcoin
[39:57] friendly convertible note and Bitcoin
[39:59] friendly safe. So these are the types of
[40:02] financing documents that a startup would
[40:04] use to raise capital. And what's on
[40:07] there is uh we basically give you the
[40:10] legal agreements that you need that
[40:12] provide you cover if you want to use
[40:14] some of the capital you raise in a round
[40:17] of funding to buy Bitcoin. so that you
[40:19] don't have to piss off investors or them
[40:22] come back to you later and say, "Hey,
[40:24] you never said that you were going to
[40:26] use any of these funds to buy Bitcoin
[40:28] with." Well, this kind of in a very
[40:31] subtle clever way allows you that wiggle
[40:34] room through uh an additional clause
[40:36] there in that we call kind of treasury
[40:38] management and use of funds.
[40:41] Awesome. Now, let's come to Micro
[40:43] Strategy because it's such an
[40:45] interesting uh company as we talked
[40:47] about it. They grew their own bitcoin
[40:49] balance sheet quite a quite some quite
[40:52] quite quite aggressively. What is the
[40:54] role of of micro strategy or sorry
[40:57] strategy? It will be very hard to to get
[40:59] that micro out. Uh what will be the role
[41:01] of strategy? What what is the role of
[41:03] strategy right now in Bitcoin and how do
[41:05] you think the the role will shift for
[41:09] strategy within the next 10 10 years?
[41:11] Obviously um only Mara can really answer
[41:14] that and he even to only to a small
[41:17] extent but what do you think will be the
[41:19] role in in the next 10 years? So today,
[41:23] and I I don't think that this has been
[41:25] totally appreciated by the Bitcoin
[41:27] community today, what Micro Strategy is
[41:30] doing is they are securitizing Bitcoin
[41:34] so that the rest of the market, these
[41:37] other pools of capital that are not able
[41:40] to buy spot Bitcoin can participate in
[41:43] Bitcoin exposure, in Bitcoin's upside.
[41:46] And so they do that through their common
[41:48] stock. They do that through kind of
[41:49] fixed uh fixed income securities. So,
[41:53] they're creating what I kind of think of
[41:55] as a menu of Bitcoin securities with
[41:59] different risk appetites so that all of
[42:02] these other pools of capital like the
[42:04] bond market or fixed income investors or
[42:08] um sovereign wealth funds, uh nation
[42:11] states, whoever can actually engage in
[42:14] the Bitcoin ecosystem at a risk
[42:17] tolerance and in a compliant way with
[42:19] whatever rules they have to follow
[42:21] within their organization. ization. So,
[42:24] they're securitizing Bitcoin,
[42:26] basically making it an easy on-ramp into
[42:29] Bitcoin for the rest of the world that
[42:32] doesn't want to hold spot Bitcoin,
[42:34] doesn't know how to, or has certain laws
[42:36] that keep them from doing so. Um, as far
[42:40] as what they will do, you know, maybe 10
[42:43] years from now or over the next 10
[42:44] years, I expect them to just keep
[42:46] creating more and more Bitcoin
[42:48] securities to go after more and more
[42:51] pools of capital. And as interest rates
[42:54] come down, these fixed coupons that
[42:57] they're providing on some of their
[42:58] securities, they're going to become
[42:59] incrementally more attractive to the
[43:01] market. Uh I think
[43:04] long-term Micro Strategies bonds will
[43:07] compete with government bonds because
[43:10] the US government, you can say it's
[43:12] backed by, you know, the world's largest
[43:14] military and the world's largest
[43:15] economy, etc. But when you invest in a
[43:18] Micro Strategy bond, you know that
[43:21] they're backed by actual digital
[43:24] realtime collateral in the form of their
[43:26] Bitcoin on the balance sheet. And I
[43:28] think that that seems less risky than a
[43:31] nation state that's $37 trillion in debt
[43:35] and, you know, all the political swings
[43:38] left and right and back and forth every
[43:40] four years. So, if I were a a bond
[43:42] investor, I would be looking at Micro
[43:45] Strategy because you're getting a higher
[43:46] coupon. You've got more collateral on
[43:49] the other side of it in a company that
[43:51] is not $37 trillion in debt. And so, I I
[43:55] do think, and Michael Sailor said so,
[43:57] that he wants to get to 1% of the $300
[44:00] trillion bond market. That would mean $3
[44:03] trillion worth of uh bond market capital
[44:08] into his stock, which he would convert
[44:10] those three trillion into Bitcoin buys.
[44:13] And at their premium, that would
[44:16] probably value the company at something
[44:19] like if you just put a 2x multiple on
[44:20] that and you were conservative, uh you'd
[44:23] say that Micro Strategy will be a $6
[44:25] trillion valuation company at the point
[44:28] when they achieve 1% of the bond market.
[44:31] And today they're worth somewhere around
[44:33] a hundred billion. So there's a lot of
[44:37] room to run and I think they have such a
[44:40] great strategy right now that they're
[44:42] basically operating this strategy with
[44:44] five to 10 people on their treasury
[44:46] team. Uh you know they're out they're
[44:48] we're actually putting out a report in
[44:50] the coming weeks uh Micro Strategy
[44:52] versus Nvidia. So these have been the
[44:54] two best performing stocks in the market
[44:56] over the last 5 years. U Micro Strategy
[44:59] has beaten Nvidia and they've done it by
[45:01] simply buying and holding Bitcoin or
[45:04] issuing shares and buying Bitcoin.
[45:06] Whereas Nvidia has all of this capex
[45:08] expenditure into chip factories and
[45:12] technology and they're affected by
[45:14] things like a trade war where there's
[45:16] tariffs on the goods and services moving
[45:18] in and out. And so people like to tease
[45:20] micro strategy that oh there is no
[45:22] product, you know, there is no nothing
[45:24] there. But when you're in the midst of a
[45:26] trade war and increasing tariffs, it's
[45:29] actually beneficial to that company to
[45:32] to not have these drags on their
[45:35] operations. So, Micro Strategy is
[45:37] beating Nvidia with basically five to 10
[45:42] people. Man, that that's so cool. uh
[45:46] hearing that and and and see and and
[45:48] seeing that uh comparison it I don't
[45:51] know if the comparison is is fair but
[45:53] it's almost like they're opening a black
[45:55] hole for all those
[45:58] feared assets and converting them
[46:01] directly into Bitcoin and then just
[46:04] opening that opening that hole a little
[46:06] bit more a little bit more to suck in
[46:08] more fiat to gain more Bitcoin at the
[46:11] end of the day. He he's basically doing
[46:14] what
[46:15] he's saying since 2020. He's like, "Hey,
[46:18] I discovered digital Manhattan and I
[46:21] will buy whatever I can."
[46:24] And it's so nice to see the consistency
[46:27] behind his strategy. Yeah. Or another
[46:29] way to visualize it would be like he's
[46:32] got a swimming pool and there's an ocean
[46:35] out there and he's kind of digging
[46:38] little channels so that the water from
[46:41] the ocean can start pooling and
[46:43] funneling into his swimming pool. And
[46:45] his swimming pool keeps getting bigger
[46:46] and bigger. And he keeps digging new
[46:49] trenches to pull in more of the the
[46:52] ocean water into his pool. He's finding
[46:54] new and creative ways to basically tap
[46:56] that giant pool of capital like the $300
[46:59] trillion bond market. Awesome. What What
[47:02] do you think will come to to treasuries
[47:05] overall for for Bitcoin treasuries and
[47:08] and for companies that that adopt
[47:11] Bitcoin? You said like you're really uh
[47:13] bullish on the companies that don't have
[47:17] something exciting. Do to invest kind of
[47:20] search for a second uh chapter? what is
[47:23] kind of your expectations over the next
[47:25] 5 to 10 years? So, I think uh the
[47:28] excitement around a company announcing
[47:31] that they're a Bitcoin treasury company
[47:32] is already starting to wear off. Um
[47:35] obviously the early adopters of that get
[47:38] more of the love and appreciation from
[47:40] the Bitcoin community. And now it seems
[47:42] like every other day we're seeing a new
[47:44] company announce that they're adopting a
[47:46] Bitcoin treasury. And so some of the the
[47:48] marketing magic is wearing off. And so I
[47:51] do think we're getting to the point
[47:53] where companies are going to do this and
[47:55] it and they're not even going to
[47:56] necessarily
[47:58] um expect a PR push around the
[48:01] announcement. It's just kind of going to
[48:03] be an obvious no-brainer. like back in
[48:06] the uh early '9s or something, if a
[48:08] company adopted a website, put up a
[48:11] website, you know, it would it might
[48:13] have been worthy of an announcement for
[48:15] the first few companies that created
[48:16] their a website, but after that, every
[48:19] company, it's kind of expected that you
[48:21] have a website and an email address. I
[48:24] think we're getting closer and closer to
[48:25] that here where that's not the exciting
[48:28] part. And I think that that's good
[48:30] because this is really just savings
[48:32] technology. Like this should not be
[48:34] treated as a marketing push. This should
[48:36] be treated as a way of protecting the
[48:38] value you've earned through your
[48:39] operating business into the future
[48:41] forever. So that you know maybe
[48:43] businesses never die. You can have
[48:46] companies that are built on on Bitcoin
[48:49] and theoretically if a company you know
[48:53] had a significant Bitcoin balance sheet
[48:55] and their operating business just wasn't
[48:57] working anymore. They they couldn't grow
[48:59] it anymore. they were, you know, costs
[49:02] have gone up too much because of
[49:03] inflation. These companies could
[49:05] ultimately scale all the way back and
[49:08] just sit on their Bitcoin positions and
[49:10] they could still be creating value for
[49:12] the founding teams and the shareholders.
[49:14] So, what's really interesting about
[49:16] Bitcoin is when you need to scale back
[49:19] the operation, you can scale it all the
[49:21] way back to just your Bitcoin holdings
[49:23] theoretically. And maybe in the future
[49:25] when you have an opportunity, a new line
[49:27] of business that's worth going after,
[49:29] you can scale back up the operational
[49:31] side using the Bitcoin on the balance
[49:33] sheet to invest in that opportunity. And
[49:35] so I see a lot more flexibility where
[49:38] sometimes companies are leaning in.
[49:40] Maybe there's a decade where they lean
[49:41] back and they're just kind of sitting on
[49:43] their Bitcoin waiting for that
[49:45] opportunity for them to jump back in in
[49:48] the operating business. Is there
[49:49] something um outside of bitting treasury
[49:52] treasuries what you kind of expecting
[49:55] for Bitcoin to to come? What what are
[49:57] you kind of excited for outside of the
[50:00] corporate world in in Bitcoin? Well,
[50:03] obviously the United States doing the
[50:06] strategic Bitcoin reserve and promoting
[50:09] the Secretary of Commerce and Secretary
[50:11] of Treasury to look for budgetneutral
[50:14] ways to acquire more Bitcoin for the
[50:16] reserve. It's uh you know it's really it
[50:20] can't be stated how bullish that is. Uh
[50:24] that is the starting flag to the race
[50:27] for nation state game theory and nation
[50:30] state adoption. And uh and I think it
[50:33] also killed the biggest piece of FUD
[50:35] that Bitcoiners often hear uh from
[50:37] people who are like, "Yeah, Bitcoin's
[50:39] too good to be true, so the government's
[50:41] going to ban it." Well, it's like, well,
[50:43] the government is now actively promoting
[50:45] it as an emerging store of value,
[50:47] digital gold, and creating a strategic
[50:50] reserve for the nation. So, are you sure
[50:54] that that's still relevant? Because it
[50:57] seems to me that Bitcoin's incentives
[50:59] have done exactly what every Bitcoiner
[51:02] thought they were going to do, which is
[51:03] that Bitcoin is for everyone. It's for
[51:04] your enemies. Nations are going to want
[51:06] it. Businesses are going to want it.
[51:08] Everybody's going to want it because
[51:09] it's just a superior form of savings
[51:12] technology and it solves one of the
[51:14] greatest problems in the world, which is
[51:16] long-term capital preservation. So, I'm
[51:19] really excited for the nation state game
[51:22] theory to play out. I I was actually
[51:26] optimistic that it would be happening at
[51:28] the speed that we're seeing it at. But
[51:31] um you know at the same time the
[51:33] election could have gone another way in
[51:35] the United States and we might have seen
[51:36] another four to eight years of
[51:39] suppression of this technology and uh
[51:42] and especially on the world stage. So
[51:45] I'm really excited for uh for what
[51:48] happens when you know the EU decides to
[51:51] embrace Bitcoin when Russia and China
[51:54] who are starting to settle trades
[51:56] amongst each other in Bitcoin when when
[51:58] a bigger percentage of that starts
[52:00] taking place when India and Pakistan and
[52:03] and all these other Brazil all these
[52:05] other large countries start to adopt
[52:07] even a small initial allocation because
[52:09] what we all know about Bitcoin is you
[52:12] know once you get a taste of it once
[52:14] you've been through a cycle uh once
[52:17] you've seen it appreciate and you
[52:19] realize that there's no maintenance
[52:20] costs and you can kind of just set it
[52:22] and forget it that you know I think this
[52:25] is really going to usher in what will
[52:28] ultimately become the new global reserve
[52:30] asset and unit of account and trade
[52:32] vehicle amongst nations and you know if
[52:35] if that comes to fruition it's just to
[52:38] the benefit of every citizen in those
[52:41] countries uh because if the nation is
[52:43] adopting the technology, it gives
[52:46] protection to the citizens of those
[52:47] countries and it also justifies
[52:50] um you know a personal investment for
[52:53] citizens in those countries and then you
[52:55] know we're really off to the races and
[52:57] Bitcoin starts to revolutionize you know
[53:00] the lives of everyone on the planet and
[53:02] people can start to own and keep the the
[53:06] value that they create in the world.
[53:08] What what a what an ending point to to
[53:11] the podcast. I I love that. Um, and I I
[53:14] couldn't agree more. I think Bitcoin is
[53:17] is is one heck of an an asset and it's
[53:20] just a matter of time till everyone on
[53:22] an individual level, on a company level
[53:25] and on a nation state level will come to
[53:28] the same conclusion. Uh, no matter with
[53:31] what incentives they're driven, uh, they
[53:33] will they will find uh, Bitcoin.
[53:37] We have a question that I asked each and
[53:39] every one of my my guests and the
[53:40] question is what can we learn from you
[53:42] besides Bitcoin? What can you learn from
[53:44] me besides Bitcoin? Uh I am kind of a
[53:48] student of startups. Uh I've spent so
[53:51] much of my life trying to learn how
[53:54] business works, how businesses can get
[53:56] off the ground. Um so entrepreneurship
[53:59] as a as a kind of form of study for me
[54:05] has been really foundational in my life
[54:07] and and I do think that the world is
[54:11] moving more towards entrepreneurship in
[54:14] general. Uh things like AI uh and all
[54:17] these software tools and working remote
[54:20] means you can have businesses get to
[54:22] hundreds of millions of dollars in
[54:23] revenue with one or two people working
[54:25] at them. So, I do think that we're
[54:27] moving to a much more distributed world
[54:31] instead of companies with hundreds of
[54:32] thousands of people working at them.
[54:35] You're going to see millions and
[54:36] millions of companies with, you know,
[54:38] two to five person teams. Um, so you're
[54:41] going to see a lot more nimble, small,
[54:43] lean businesses that are leveraging
[54:45] these tools and leveraging not having to
[54:48] pay for an office. um a and just kind of
[54:52] hiring who's needed and only who's
[54:55] needed and letting these tools do the
[54:57] rest. So I guess uh if you listen to me
[55:01] on like the new foundations podcast, our
[55:03] podcast at Acropolis, you're going to
[55:05] hear a lot about how businesses can
[55:09] adopt things like a lean startup
[55:10] methodology and how when you use your
[55:12] incremental dollar to buy Bitcoin,
[55:14] you're positioning the business with a
[55:17] lot of optionality in the future. So I
[55:19] guess anything to do with
[55:20] entrepreneurship, startups, small
[55:22] business, uh that's kind of my other
[55:24] sweet spot. Love that. I And it's I mean
[55:27] there are already the those small
[55:29] companies starting uh we see that more
[55:32] and more. And I I just talked I think it
[55:37] was just today in the morning where I
[55:39] talked with someone uh on on the podcast
[55:42] where he was like he's really excited
[55:44] for the
[55:46] first five person $1 billion company uh
[55:50] that is is literally like very small has
[55:53] some AI agents uh and the team is is
[55:56] basically just like the the founders and
[55:59] maybe one other person and like or just
[56:01] a collection of some small influ uh
[56:04] freelancers that work together and they
[56:07] leverage technology to the do the
[56:09] widest. Yeah, it's it's it's a it's a
[56:13] future that is coming closer and closer
[56:16] and is really hard to understand for
[56:19] those who are in big corporations and
[56:22] then think there has to be like uh
[56:24] meetings for everything and stuff like
[56:25] that. Um, and I'm I'm very much uh
[56:29] looking forward to that small
[56:31] decentralized nimble future of of
[56:33] companies. I like that you brought that
[56:35] in. Yeah, it's it's coming. It's already
[56:38] starting. And um whether people like it
[56:42] or not, that is what the future
[56:44] landscape is going to look like. It's
[56:45] going to be small teams leveraging AI
[56:48] and freelance workers in, you know, all
[56:50] over the world because now talent is
[56:52] global when you're working like, you
[56:54] know, we do most of the time just from a
[56:56] Zoom link or a Google Hangouts link. Um,
[56:59] everybody can work anywhere and you
[57:02] know, you can have a freelancer who's
[57:03] working five different companies almost
[57:06] like an Uber style and there's there's
[57:08] advantages and disadvantages to that,
[57:10] but uh it's never been a better time to
[57:13] start a business. Oh, awesome.
[57:15] Absolutely. I also
[57:17] have maybe too many but three
[57:19] freelancers uh working on the podcast uh
[57:22] on on the back end of it and it's it's
[57:24] just so amazing because everyone is is
[57:27] exactly there for uh one task and it's
[57:31] super efficient and and very very nice
[57:34] to work with all of them and and very
[57:36] like there there's no administration
[57:39] overhead really because like there's
[57:41] like those areas and they do the work
[57:43] and they do a fantastic job at it. It's
[57:45] it's really nice to to see that in
[57:47] action and they are like everywhere like
[57:49] Colombia, El Salvador, Austria, like
[57:52] it's basically all over the world which
[57:54] is which is amazing to see. Yeah. No,
[57:58] and it makes it better cuz you're
[57:59] getting the perspectives of people all
[58:01] over the world and um yeah, the business
[58:05] is going to bring people together now
[58:07] more than it it ever has. Absolutely.
[58:11] Um, we have an end routine in the
[58:12] podcast where the previous guest is
[58:14] asking a question for the next guest
[58:16] without knowing who the next guest
[58:18] actually is. And the previous guest asks
[58:20] you the question, what do you think will
[58:22] be the role of Bitcoin for human rights?
[58:25] I think Bitcoin has already done for
[58:29] human rights one of the most incredible
[58:32] things that it could possibly hope to
[58:34] achieve, which is providing property
[58:36] rights to all. Uh I think property
[58:38] rights is foundational in society. Um
[58:42] you you can look at the the founding of
[58:45] the United States of America. The
[58:48] founding fathers took property rights
[58:50] very seriously. Without the ability to
[58:53] own what you create in the world and and
[58:55] protect it, safeguard it, keep it from
[58:57] others who uh want to take it from you
[59:00] or feel that they have a claim to it. uh
[59:03] you really don't have an incentive for
[59:05] people to wake up in the morning and
[59:07] create value for society and make the
[59:09] world an incrementally better place for
[59:12] next generations. So to me, Bitcoin
[59:14] represents property rights for all and
[59:17] unconfiscable value and wealth creation
[59:20] for all. Um so property rights that
[59:24] would be my answer there. I love that.
[59:27] The that's that's really really really
[59:29] really cool. Um, before I let you go,
[59:33] where can people find you and and ask
[59:34] you questions? Uh, you can find me on
[59:37] Twitter, chasepier, all attached. Um, or
