[00:00] this is this is bad money look
[00:01] towards Bitcoin maybe what Bitcoin has
[00:03] done is just really enlightened my
[00:07] understanding of how the world actually
[00:09] operates and the way it works and what
[00:11] Fiat money is and what the you know
[00:14] Global Reserve currency means and IMF
[00:17] and the wef Bitcoin is hoping Bitcoin is
[00:20] an opportunity for us to really Take
[00:22] Back Control of our own autonomy we all
[00:24] come back to that one thing that's
[00:26] called freedom and hope and the
[00:28] prosperity of a new
[00:31] I was at the fat mine today and uh it's
[00:34] days like today that I think do you know
[00:36] what I wish I was full-time in Bitcoin
[00:39] but maybe that's just a dream but we're
[00:41] on the mission aren't we Robin because
[00:44] obviously we're create we're creating
[00:45] things like podcast to get the signal of
[00:47] Bitcoin out there so hopefully we're
[00:49] doing ourselves a favor by uh you know
[00:52] presenting ourselves and our and our
[00:54] personalities out there into the space
[00:56] so yeah this is definitely a really cool
[00:59] s are you planning to do it full-time
[01:01] like is there like a plan to do it at
[01:03] some point only like Bitcoin stuff or
[01:06] even like maybe working in a Bitcoin
[01:08] company and still having a feat pay or
[01:09] something like that I'm open to
[01:11] possibilities right and I think I have
[01:13] all my life I think you know throughout
[01:16] my life I was sort of keeping my eye on
[01:19] the horizon right to see what
[01:20] opportunities come up and um so yeah I'm
[01:24] always being one of those sort of
[01:25] Rolling Stones if you like of sort of
[01:27] thinking about what else could I do what
[01:30] else can I learn how else can I better
[01:33] myself and things like that sometimes
[01:35] motivated by wealth right or what is it
[01:37] I can do to get paid more to sort of
[01:39] actually for a change have some
[01:42] disposable income rather than just
[01:44] trying to pay the bills keep my head
[01:47] above water what else is it can I do at
[01:49] one stage I was work when I was working
[01:52] um a long time ago now in the police and
[01:55] we can discuss that if you want but um I
[01:58] was a police officer for 17 years and
[01:59] even then I you know I was struggling to
[02:02] pay the mortgage the bills and all that
[02:04] sort of stuff and uh I even enrolled on
[02:07] to uh a night College I was doing three
[02:09] evenings a week in some college in the
[02:12] town that I once lived in studying to
[02:15] become a qualified
[02:16] electrician and it took me three years
[02:19] to get that qualification uh work you
[02:21] know going three evenings a week at this
[02:23] college to do that all with the mindset
[02:27] that once I'm qualified maybe I can do
[02:29] an additional job in between my shifts
[02:32] on my day off as an additional income to
[02:36] help sort of um you know plug in a
[02:40] little bit of income that I can be a
[02:42] little bit more comfortable but all I
[02:44] was doing was just running faster on
[02:46] this
[02:47] hamsters real right of trying to obtain
[02:50] something that was essentially
[02:52] unobtainable because little did I know
[02:56] um as ignorant as I was until I jumped
[02:59] down the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole was this
[03:01] thing called inflation right and you're
[03:03] forever just chasing this
[03:07] unobtainable goal and even if you get
[03:09] there you still have to work in order to
[03:12] sustain it so yeah that's that's me
[03:15] going off in a bit of a rant of my life
[03:17] but you know that's I think that's where
[03:19] a lot of people get sort of stuck is is
[03:22] in this kind of pursuit towards
[03:24] something um that is very difficult to
[03:27] get to yeah it's like a moving Target
[03:30] like if if you chasing after dollars or
[03:32] after Fiat money in general it's it's
[03:34] definitely moving Target because 1
[03:36] million now is not that what what it was
[03:39] 20 years ago and it will definitely be
[03:41] different in 20 years from now so it's
[03:44] it's like if you're shooting for that
[03:45] one million yeah it's getting easier but
[03:48] the one million is not what it
[03:50] was 100% And um I don't know if you saw
[03:53] it I put a tweet out the other day um
[03:56] and it was um something along the lines
[03:58] of um when Bitcoin gets to 1 million how
[04:02] much will 1 million actually be worth
[04:06] you know it was it like when we get
[04:09] there what actually would it be able to
[04:11] buy in real life right and the the
[04:13] people's responses are as weird as
[04:16] wonderful as you might expect on on X
[04:19] but also like I was rewatching Breaking
[04:21] Bad recently and I came across the
[04:23] episode when I it Skyler his wife sort
[04:26] of showed him the warehouse where he had
[04:28] 8 million I think it was or was it 80
[04:32] million I can't remember he had like
[04:33] millions of dollars stacked up in paper
[04:36] money in this warehouse and she was
[04:38] saying something like oh this is enough
[04:39] for 10 lifetimes but really if you if
[04:43] you factor in inflation like Breaking
[04:45] Bad was 2010 right um and now we're at
[04:49] 24 so if you factor in the amount of
[04:52] inflation we've had since then he would
[04:54] have eroded 40% of his purchasing power
[04:58] already so if he
[05:00] kept it there for another 14 years that
[05:02] will buy him nothing yeah he better go
[05:06] out and keep cooking that that me right
[05:09] because it's just going to be worth
[05:10] nothing eventually right and I think I
[05:12] think people don't really understand
[05:13] that and I think that's the mission that
[05:15] we're trying to get out there as
[05:16] bitcoiners right is like this is
[05:18] this is bad money so um yeah look
[05:22] towards Bitcoin maybe yeah I love that
[05:24] you're diving down the rabbit holes and
[05:27] uh I always do before before I have a
[05:30] guest on I check if they were on your
[05:32] episode like I'm going on on YouTube
[05:35] usually and see which uh podcast they
[05:38] have been on and I always love to watch
[05:41] yours uh and learn more about the guest
[05:43] because when you go down the rabbit hole
[05:45] you learn a lot about the person in
[05:47] general uh and I usually keep it uh
[05:50] short the rabbit hole story and try to
[05:53] keep like a lot of different questions
[05:55] in in my mind uh but going down the
[05:58] rabbit hole changes a lot of people
[06:00] lives especially those that are young or
[06:03] have like an inflection point with
[06:05] Bitcoin in their lives there some of
[06:08] course that they understood like
[06:09] Austrian economics before Bitcoin austan
[06:12] economics was there before Bitcoin and
[06:13] if you're in that mindset and you're
[06:15] good in your life maybe Bitcoin was
[06:17] really natural for you and it it came
[06:20] natural but for most people it changed a
[06:22] lot uh and the first question I actually
[06:25] wanted to ask you is um from all those
[06:27] episodes people are going down the
[06:29] rabbit hole and and and telling you
[06:32] really cool stories sometimes what did
[06:34] you learn from from those those stories
[06:37] from the guests like what is the the the
[06:39] biggest takeaways of I think what what
[06:41] is it over 200 videos I saw on YouTube
[06:44] yeah so obviously being the host of
[06:47] rabbit hole stories and me and U my
[06:50] co-host Joelle who's uh also wasan like
[06:53] yourself Robin and um we met a London uh
[06:57] Bitcoin Meetup and uh after a few um
[07:02] times we we got into discussion about
[07:06] wanting to represent a little bit more
[07:09] about the represent the European voice
[07:12] more I think in in the space because
[07:13] obviously you got a lot of
[07:15] representation over in the states and
[07:16] things like that and there is a it's
[07:19] beautiful to see a growing uh podcast
[07:21] Community forming yourself being one of
[07:23] them and um you got Bitcoin for
[07:26] Millennials and others popping up as
[07:28] well so it's nice seeing this kind of
[07:30] natural sort of evolution of of
[07:33] different signals getting out there
[07:35] people like I've said to me before asked
[07:39] the question are there too many Bitcoin
[07:40] podcasts and I think you know there's
[07:43] been a little bit of that conversation
[07:44] on uh X and nosta um last year as well
[07:49] and honestly I don't think that you can
[07:52] ever have too many Bitcoin podcasts
[07:54] because the fascinating thing I think
[07:57] about and what one of the things I've
[07:58] learned to answer your question is
[08:01] everyone's got their own individual
[08:03] personality that they bring into the
[08:05] Bitcoin ecosystem right and every
[08:08] Bitcoin podcast that pops up whether
[08:10] it's the Bitcoin Source um over in
[08:12] America or uh it's your podcast or you
[08:16] know all the others they they've all got
[08:19] their own uh personalities and their own
[08:21] voice and their own sort of ideas or
[08:24] ideologies about Bitcoin right and
[08:26] they're putting that signal out there
[08:28] and they're resonating with a certain
[08:31] amount of people people that I can't
[08:33] resonate with and me and Joel can't
[08:35] resonate with right but obviously the
[08:37] more people and the more different
[08:39] personalities and the more kind of ideas
[08:41] there are that are forming and putting
[08:43] their voice out there the more people
[08:44] we're going to actually resonate with
[08:46] and that ripple effect hopefully will
[08:48] just signal in different frequencies to
[08:50] different people and the idea about
[08:52] rabbit hole stories is yes guests come
[08:55] on the show and we say mate what's your
[08:56] what's your Bitcoin origin story you
[08:58] know how did you get into Bitcoin how
[09:00] did you discover it and not only that
[09:04] what impact did it have on you and what
[09:06] is it you're doing now in the space so
[09:08] we we're trying to figure out and um
[09:11] we're trying to elevate voices um for
[09:15] people to hear that might resonate uh
[09:19] voices that you know so we want to get
[09:20] as many different people on from many
[09:22] different parts of the ecosystem just to
[09:24] tell us the rabbit hole story and we go
[09:27] in just like I have with you Robin
[09:29] there's no sort of pre-script or sort of
[09:32] pre-discussion about what we're going to
[09:34] talk about and that's what I love is the
[09:37] sort of flow of things right because I
[09:39] think then we can only then bring in our
[09:42] personalities our insights and have a
[09:45] discussion together right and that's
[09:48] what I think is great about what we do
[09:50] is because something might come up that
[09:52] the person says that will trigger off a
[09:54] question in my head a curiosity a
[09:57] question that I thought you know what
[09:58] that would be interesting to know and I
[10:00] just attach that to my own Rabbit Hole
[10:02] story because the whole idea of going
[10:05] down a rabbit hole for me anyway is to
[10:07] question everything reevaluate my
[10:11] understanding of the thing I once knew
[10:14] before I went into the rabbit hole
[10:16] because I've come in with the Barnacles
[10:19] of the Legacy system and ideas that
[10:22] they've indoctrinated in me in some way
[10:25] and it's great to have a
[10:28] community with um different insights
[10:31] different ideas and different
[10:32] understandings of things and I want to
[10:34] embrace that I want to sort of like take
[10:36] that on and sort of um validate that
[10:39] against my own understanding of things
[10:42] and I think that's what we we should be
[10:44] doing in the space and I think I've been
[10:47] quite vocal lately recently about uh
[10:50] maybe we should just be less on
[10:52] each other and sort of like more sort of
[10:55] engaging in actual debate and discourse
[10:58] rather than just blocking each other
[10:59] shutting each other down and I know it's
[11:01] the nature of social media right but I
[11:04] think we should be careful of falling
[11:06] into these traps of falling into like we
[11:08] should
[11:10] actually explore the rabbit hole um and
[11:14] sort of come together as as sort of like
[11:17] inquisitive if you like in some way but
[11:20] you know that's that's my own mindset of
[11:22] the rabbit hole and that's how Rabbit
[11:25] Hole stories is evolving I think yeah
[11:28] and that's uh that's it's a beautiful
[11:29] thing uh if you're working closer
[11:31] together and I think also on the Note as
[11:33] you said it in Europe there's not enough
[11:36] uh like it's it's the the Americans seem
[11:38] to be like strong on the podcast side
[11:40] there's more stories on there I think
[11:42] it's also because there are so many
[11:44] different languages in Europe uh in
[11:46] Germany for example I think we have a
[11:48] really cool Community with block trainer
[11:51] he only produces in German so people
[11:54] don't even know him when they don't
[11:56] speak German and I guess there are great
[11:59] great podcast in Spanish that that I
[12:01] never heard there are great uh podcast
[12:03] in any other language in the European uh
[12:06] in the European faere where I never
[12:08] heard from them but in America there's
[12:10] just like one language so you know all
[12:12] the podcasts there there's not there's
[12:14] nothing uh different going on there so
[12:16] it's I think sometimes maybe it it comes
[12:19] across stronger because they have one
[12:21] language and you hear about them more
[12:23] and they're really good also in
[12:24] marketing I think like Americans are
[12:26] really good in marketing themselves and
[12:29] uh marketing stuff in general so uh
[12:33] think we have a really strong community
[12:35] in Europe that has to be disc discovered
[12:37] uh and maybe uh when we have ai real
[12:41] time translation this will help I saw
[12:44] some scary videos well one of them being
[12:46] the uh recent speech by um uh what's it
[12:49] the Argentinian president yes like yeah
[12:53] obviously like that was translated in
[12:55] English using AI right and that was a
[12:58] little bit freaky watching that because
[12:59] obviously his mouth was moving as if he
[13:01] was speaking English but he was clearly
[13:02] not and um yeah but in in that in that
[13:05] same thread in that same point you're
[13:07] right in the sense that AI I mean
[13:09] there's a lot of criticism within the
[13:12] Bitcoin ecosystem about what AI is and
[13:15] uh the centralization of it and all that
[13:17] kind of stuff and yeah I get it and
[13:18] these are all valid points but I think
[13:21] we should also take on the fact that you
[13:22] know the advancement in technology um
[13:26] and the fact that we able to just
[13:27] communicate online live
[13:29] and record this and stuff like that is a
[13:31] way for people to it's a tool
[13:34] essentially right and we should use
[13:35] these tools to sort of simplify our
[13:38] lives in some way but also be conscious
[13:40] of the the dangers that you know can
[13:43] come about as a result of these tools so
[13:46] yeah but AI it could also be a good
[13:49] opportunity for us to sort of um
[13:52] communicate across different languages
[13:54] together I always I always remembered at
[13:56] one speech I forgot her name but there's
[13:58] German politician uh that spoke about
[14:01] Bitcoin in the German Parliament and it
[14:04] was translated with an AI tool and it
[14:06] was all over Twitter for like a week uh
[14:09] and I was also reposting it and people
[14:11] were replying to me it's like why are
[14:14] these speaking English in the German
[14:16] Parliament not it's
[14:19] AI yeah yeah but it also it raises the
[14:23] the the the point really as well is like
[14:26] there's so much
[14:30] confusing uh narratives out there the
[14:32] world is like I don't know the
[14:34] information agents brought about um
[14:37] obviously the abundance and immediate
[14:39] access to information but it's also
[14:40] brought about a confusing head spinning
[14:44] uh it's it's difficult to sift through
[14:47] what is the truth now what what is real
[14:51] and what narratives are you know
[14:54] misguided or um unilaterally uh
[14:59] understood right it's it's a difficult
[15:01] uh thing nowadays to sort of like sift
[15:03] through stuff so I think we should be as
[15:06] bitcoiners very uh Vigilant about um
[15:10] narratives and stuff and um that's part
[15:13] of why I'm questioning Bitcoin is
[15:15] because you know I want to now question
[15:17] everything I want to sort of check it
[15:19] against my own understanding of things
[15:21] like I said earlier and um it's very
[15:24] easy to fall into a trap I think of just
[15:28] seeking out only things that I agree
[15:31] with because that's the easy thing to do
[15:34] right it's easier for me just to sort of
[15:36] confirm my own
[15:38] bias rather than actually go through the
[15:42] difficult and sometimes painful truth of
[15:46] admitting to myself that I might have
[15:48] been wrong and I think that we should
[15:49] really embrace the fact that we should
[15:52] rearn and actually embrace that as an
[15:54] opportunity for us to see the world
[15:57] through a different lens and that's the
[15:58] Bitcoin lens right and that provides me
[16:01] the incentive to seek out um truth in
[16:06] some way um but I'm I'm curious Robin
[16:11] um I don't know if you experienced this
[16:13] and obviously you're the one questioning
[16:16] me right but I don't know whether you've
[16:18] agreed with with much about what I've
[16:20] said and I invite you to come back and
[16:24] tell me if you think in different ways
[16:27] and the reason why I'm saying that is
[16:29] because I think sometimes we're in
[16:31] danger when we're recording podcasts is
[16:34] like just agreeing or not actually
[16:36] challenging people and I think we should
[16:38] do more of
[16:39] that and you know rather than um going
[16:43] around and just agree hold a mirror up
[16:45] to them just as much as we should hold a
[16:47] mirror up to ourselves right um so I'm
[16:49] just wondering what you think about that
[16:51] yeah it's an interesting because I had
[16:54] already like at least five six guests on
[16:57] where they have raised a point in the
[17:00] middle of the discussion where I
[17:03] disagreed uh to a really big like
[17:06] usually with bitcoiners I'm agreeing a
[17:09] lot like I usually especially in the
[17:11] beginning I reached out to people that I
[17:13] already knew so uh when you know people
[17:17] and and you know what to ask them
[17:19] control the questioning part it's it's
[17:22] that there not usually not a big debate
[17:24] going on there but there are sometimes
[17:26] the point where I have to decide do I
[17:28] want to make it a podcast where I
[17:32] explore um this discussion where I want
[17:36] to challenge people or I think Lex
[17:39] Freedman you know the podcast he always
[17:42] also makes a disclaimer in front of the
[17:44] podcast where he says
[17:46] um sometimes the guest says something I
[17:49] disagree with but I want to explore his
[17:52] opinion and that's why I'm usually not
[17:55] challenging him like something along
[17:57] these lines he says is way better than
[17:58] me uh but he's saying basically he's not
[18:02] challenging them at the moment to
[18:06] explore what he is thinking because
[18:09] sometimes I also think that when we
[18:11] discuss too much as you said in the the
[18:14] in the early when the discussion is like
[18:16] too heated too much then we might have
[18:19] the Trap of like just proving each other
[18:21] wrong like just on each other
[18:24] like there's a balance to it where you
[18:25] have to question the guests so his his
[18:29] thinking comes out and The Listener can
[18:31] see for thems oh do I like this opinion
[18:35] or not and I usually take the more
[18:37] passive approach to be honest to be like
[18:40] I I want to ask them and there was the
[18:43] those few steps along the way I made a
[18:46] podcast with British hle if you saw it I
[18:49] disagreed with some points with him I
[18:52] made recently a podcast with a gold buck
[18:55] that also has Bitcoin like he yeah has
[18:58] like a hybrid version but he still has a
[19:01] little bit more gold than Bitcoin I
[19:02] disagreed with him a lot but I wanted to
[19:06] uh find out why they're thinking like
[19:08] that what what they are going through
[19:10] the other route is like questioning him
[19:12] a lot and debating him like there's a
[19:14] fine balance to find uh and coming
[19:18] through the truth but as you said it's a
[19:21] hard thing to do because um it's it's
[19:25] easy to fall in the Trap especially with
[19:27] the feet no matter where you are and it
[19:30] doesn't matter if you're on on Twitter
[19:32] Youtube Tik Tok or whereever there's
[19:34] always a feed that feeding you stuff
[19:36] which you interact with if you're not
[19:39] interacting with stuff you're not
[19:40] feeding it because it does not keep you
[19:42] on the platform so the algorithms are
[19:45] designed that way way that you interact
[19:48] with them so there's a confirmation bias
[19:51] programmed into those things and it can
[19:54] lead to a society that is completely
[19:57] asleep
[19:58] and is not questionings oh uh what is
[20:02] this Bitcoin thing
[20:04] actually is it actually wasteful for the
[20:06] environment is actually like all those
[20:08] FS that do you actually question them
[20:11] like and that's that's an interesting
[20:12] thing because
[20:14] uh that's maybe also one reason and I
[20:17] don't know if if you also see it that
[20:19] way uh one reason uh why so many people
[20:22] are asleep uh and and don't question
[20:25] money yeah I mean you make very inter in
[20:28] point and look with Rabbit Hole stories
[20:30] for example we we rarely challenge
[20:32] people because it's it's their Rabbit
[20:36] Hole story we we want to
[20:38] know you know how they see the world
[20:41] through this Bitcoin lens and we don't
[20:43] challenge much in that we've started to
[20:46] put out episodes that are just me and
[20:48] Joelle uh talking um we put one out
[20:52] recently and this is this is then the
[20:54] opportunity for us to you know give our
[20:57] sort of uh persp perspective on things
[20:59] and be a little bit critical and
[21:01] challenging of some of the things that
[21:02] we've seen as well and and sort of
[21:04] inject our sort of mindset into it as
[21:06] well so we're kind of wanting Rabbit
[21:09] Hole stories to evolve if you like not
[21:11] only just to become people's Rabbit Hole
[21:13] stories but then for me and Joel once
[21:16] we've been on these different Journeys
[21:18] to sort of take all that information in
[21:22] and then sort of like absorb it as and
[21:25] review that and then come out with our
[21:27] own kind of ideas about the sort of
[21:29] narratives in the space and what we
[21:31] think about that so I think you know
[21:34] that's that's that's what we're trying
[21:35] to focus on but you make you make an
[21:37] interesting point about algorithms and
[21:39] things like that and that's something we
[21:40] certainly should be mindful of and it's
[21:43] an easy trap to fall into with the stuff
[21:46] that you engage with because these these
[21:47] social media platforms want to keep you
[21:51] on their platforms for as long as
[21:53] possible right so in competition with
[21:55] other social networking platforms right
[21:57] so the algorithms are designed to keep
[21:59] you engaged and if you're engaged in
[22:02] constant arguments but that's what keeps
[22:03] you on there they're going to make sure
[22:05] you get fed that kind of stuff if you're
[22:07] you know you're it's trying to give you
[22:10] what it is that it thinks you want and I
[22:13] think we should uh be mindful of that
[22:16] when we're engaging on X for example or
[22:19] anywhere we go is because you know even
[22:22] on YouTube for example I might have
[22:24] watched a video and all of a sudden I'm
[22:27] getting sort of other videos that are
[22:29] similar kind of tone and threed to that
[22:31] and I'm like only just wanted to watch
[22:33] that one video why am I getting all this
[22:35] other stuff so it's it's it's definitely
[22:37] something we should be thinking about
[22:39] for sure I'm super excited to announce
[22:42] that this podcast just got the first
[22:46] ever sponsor I just started the podcast
[22:49] out like three months ago and now we
[22:51] have 21 Bitcoin as a partner for this
[22:55] podcast 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from
[22:59] day one and they teach and preach self
[23:03] custody this is my goto exchange when
[23:07] someone asks me oh where can I buy my
[23:09] Bitcoin from this is the easiest entry
[23:12] for bitcoiners and if you want lower
[23:15] fees Plus at the same time support this
[23:18] podcast use code Robin and click the
[23:21] link in the description an interesting
[23:24] experiment is also um going on the feed
[23:27] of I don't know your your girlfriend
[23:29] your one of your friends even that
[23:32] people that are really close to you they
[23:34] sometimes have completely different uh
[23:36] feeds already and it's interesting to
[23:38] see just like the same app with the same
[23:41] interface and the topics are completely
[23:44] different from uh from one of each other
[23:48] um maybe uh going back uh to the rabbit
[23:51] hole what do people usually find in the
[23:55] those rabbit holes besides the best
[23:57] money ever
[23:58] like what do you see as uh people are
[24:01] discovering in their Rabbit Hole stories
[24:05] uh and finding besides just Bitcoin
[24:08] itself like I think that sometimes bit
[24:11] uh Bitcoin is having interesting uh
[24:14] phases of their life when they discover
[24:16] Bitcoin and it's like this this stick
[24:18] where they find a new way one of the
[24:20] common questions I I ask is like what
[24:23] was the
[24:25] thing that was the light bulb moment for
[24:28] you what was it that sort of suddenly
[24:32] made you understand it and that was the
[24:35] thing that kind of made you fall down
[24:38] this rabbit hole and a lot of people
[24:39] struggle with that question and and
[24:42] often you get do you know what there
[24:44] wasn't that one just that one thing it
[24:47] was kind of this kind of wave that just
[24:51] kind of
[24:52] eventually hit them and then they were
[24:55] then they were down this rabbit hole and
[24:57] it's it's hard for people to grasp even
[24:59] for me for example there wasn't actually
[25:01] one particular thing I was like this is
[25:03] a light bulb moment now I'm down a
[25:04] rabbit hole it was it was a series of
[25:08] just Little micro things right of like
[25:10] oh that's interesting listen to this
[25:12] podcast or listen to this whatever it
[25:16] may be or this audio book and then you
[25:18] start sort of like putting these bits of
[25:21] the puzzle together and it's almost like
[25:23] I don't know if you ever saw it maybe
[25:25] I'm just showing my age here and
[25:27] obviously you know I'm over here in the
[25:29] UK but there was this TV show called
[25:31] catchphrase and it was about sort of
[25:34] like these things that came up on the
[25:35] screen and people used to then press the
[25:37] buzzer to give the catchphrase and in
[25:39] between these sort of um levels they
[25:42] used to do this thing where they used to
[25:44] press the buzzer and it used to reveal a
[25:46] little bit of an image and then as this
[25:50] little bit of an image came up they
[25:51] would see whether they can see what the
[25:54] catchphrase is behind this and the more
[25:57] bits that were being removed the more of
[25:58] the picture was being revealed until
[26:01] they can actually see enough of it to
[26:02] understand what it was that it was sort
[26:04] of being disguised right and I think
[26:06] that's the kind of thing that um happens
[26:09] in space there's enough of the
[26:13] veil of Legacy narratives that have
[26:15] slipped for you just to see enough
[26:18] behind it to realize there's something
[26:20] quite fascinating behind it and I think
[26:22] that's that's when people then start to
[26:24] sort of remove the rest of it and start
[26:27] to dismantle it so I think that's the
[26:30] common sort of
[26:31] overriding way that people then discover
[26:34] this this fascinating thing called
[26:35] Bitcoin and dedicate or it incentivizes
[26:39] them to invest quite a lot of time in
[26:41] this space to sort of really truly put
[26:44] it to the test and check their
[26:46] understanding and I went through a
[26:49] process of like you know what I must be
[26:50] wrong this is too good to be true and I
[26:53] think that is a moment for me where I
[26:55] was like okay now I need to sort of like
[26:57] really put it to the test and that's how
[27:00] this whole questioning Bitcoin on
[27:01] Twitter thing evolved for me because I
[27:03] wanted to put out questions into the
[27:05] community to see what came back and I I
[27:08] think that's how it sort of happened for
[27:10] me personally how did your like personal
[27:14] opinion change in the rabbit hole Story
[27:18] how was
[27:19] Theon before Bitcoin completely
[27:22] different from right now I would say
[27:25] completely different I think I just
[27:27] surrendered myself to what life was and
[27:31] that was you know just get up in the
[27:33] morning go to work was just work as hard
[27:35] as I can get back and just sort of like
[27:38] make sure that I'm not defaulting on
[27:40] anything and I'm paying the bills and
[27:42] just sort of like you know come back to
[27:44] my house with you know my wife and kids
[27:47] and just sort of live the the normal
[27:50] average life and I I think I just sort
[27:52] of surrendered to that as my life right
[27:54] I was thinking about like what age were
[27:56] I'm going to be my retire how much could
[27:59] I potentially save what would my
[28:01] retirement look like so that just as an
[28:03] average human battery in this world
[28:06] right but I think what Bitcoin has done
[28:08] is just really enlightened my
[28:12] understanding of how the world actually
[28:15] operates and the way it works and what
[28:18] Fiat money is and what the um you know
[28:22] Global Reserve currency means and IMF
[28:24] and the WF and like all these things
[28:27] start to sort of like come up and you're
[28:31] like holy this is actually a system
[28:36] that is designed to drain us as a
[28:39] resource for their benefit and gain and
[28:42] Bitcoin is an opportunity um Bitcoin is
[28:45] Hope if you like Bitcoin is a an
[28:48] opportunity for uh us to really Take
[28:50] Back Control of our own autonomy and and
[28:54] our own sort of ideas and mindset
[28:56] because I think we as human being has
[28:57] got such great potential that we have
[29:00] not previously had access to and Bitcoin
[29:03] provides that opportunity and that's why
[29:06] you know it's important for us to get
[29:07] that signal out there in ways that
[29:09] people can understand and at least sort
[29:11] of be curious enough about it to give it
[29:14] a look right and um hopefully there will
[29:17] be this point where people will enough
[29:20] people will see it enough to stand up
[29:23] against the system that sometimes just
[29:26] feels complet completely
[29:28] Unstoppable um at times so yeah that's
[29:31] what it's done for me really it's given
[29:32] me the energy uh to really try and sort
[29:35] of uh put the signal out there in as
[29:37] best way as I can yeah it just came up
[29:41] in my mind I sometimes see and hear
[29:44] people uh on in real life also on X that
[29:49] kind of woke up to the whole system to
[29:51] the field money system to uh what the we
[29:54] is doing what the IMF is doing to stuff
[29:56] like that and then they're saying at the
[29:58] same time H but Bitcoin is just a test
[30:01] object to to that it's like to trying to
[30:05] get the the uh people into digital
[30:08] currencies and it's just like an an
[30:11] thing that comes for the actual thing uh
[30:15] and uh it's it's it's interesting how
[30:17] people are waking up to some extent and
[30:20] not to all extents and at the same time
[30:22] like questioning yourself is like what
[30:25] are they right wrong like is like you
[30:29] have to question yourself but in general
[30:32] I think bitcoiners I never met a group
[30:34] of people is actually so curious about
[30:36] life have about in about life sometimes
[30:40] so different approaches like I was at
[30:43] one Bitcoin Meetup in in Austrian GRS uh
[30:46] where I sat in front of two bitcoiners
[30:49] and the one was carnivore like only
[30:51] eating meat and the other one was vegan
[30:53] raw vegan only eating eating non-animal
[30:56] products and it was such a lovely um
[31:00] encounter because they were completely
[31:01] nice to each other extremely respectful
[31:04] and they actually kind of come together
[31:06] and uh saw how many things they actually
[31:10] had in common like fresh food is better
[31:13] than processed food and stuff like that
[31:15] and so it's like Bitcoin has the the
[31:18] unit of account and now they are like on
[31:20] the same page even though they in such
[31:23] different connection like it it's an
[31:25] it's interesting to see the Bitcoin
[31:26] community how they question things how
[31:28] they have different approaches but we
[31:29] all come back to that one thing that's
[31:32] kind of called freedom and hope and like
[31:35] the prosperity of a new world I agree
[31:38] and there's there's a Bitcoin meet up
[31:40] tonight here in London that I I won't
[31:42] unfortunately be able to to get to but
[31:45] um it's great going along and yeah
[31:47] you're right seeing different people
[31:49] with different perspectives from all
[31:51] walks of life from all different a ages
[31:53] and I think partly um and I don't know
[31:56] what it's like out with where you are
[31:58] with your meetups but with London um
[32:01] it's a fairly Unique city in the sense
[32:03] that it's a it's a Melting Pot of
[32:06] different sort of um people from you
[32:09] know all Races religions and and and all
[32:12] walks of life and you start to see that
[32:14] now in the the London Bitcoin Meetup
[32:18] right there's so many different people
[32:20] there with so many different ideas uh
[32:23] and perspectives and it's great going
[32:25] along to sort of hear that and and
[32:27] respect the fact that they've got
[32:29] different uh ideas and opinions right um
[32:33] because they all understand the promise
[32:34] of Bitcoin and you know what some people
[32:36] have different ideas about what Bitcoin
[32:38] is as well and I I find that fascinating
[32:41] because obviously in my mind I might
[32:43] have you know an idea or vision for
[32:46] Bitcoin but that's also based on my own
[32:48] sort of upbringing my mindset and my my
[32:52] own fantasies right and the way I see it
[32:54] sort of going in the future and somebody
[32:56] when they come with a different
[32:57] perspective I'm like oh that's
[32:58] interesting how did you even get to that
[33:00] in the first place what where have you
[33:02] come from in order to get to that kind
[33:04] of idea and that helps me sort of like
[33:06] navigate myself in my own Rabbit Hole in
[33:09] some way
[33:12] yeah that's that's that's an amazing
[33:14] point in uh having like the questioning
[33:18] yourself and in in this like I think to
[33:21] be a bit corner you have to question a
[33:23] lot like you you have to uh like there
[33:26] are obviously a lot of people just came
[33:28] up because of the number up technology
[33:31] uh but they sticked around and
[33:33] especially the guys that are now Bitcoin
[33:35] only because the the people that are
[33:37] came into Bitcoin because of n Go up and
[33:41] St with number go up they're now all in
[33:43] crypto they in some shitcoin they are
[33:46] doing trading with Bitcoin they're doing
[33:49] all sorts of things because they still
[33:51] hunting for feeld and not hunting for uh
[33:54] Bitcoin so that's completely different
[33:56] for me andless and that's that's also
[33:58] raises an interesting question where
[33:59] like we having now more and more Bitcoin
[34:02] only podcasts this is like an era where
[34:05] uh 2017 if you go back there's not a lot
[34:08] of Bitcoin only content there's even
[34:10] like the Reddit Bitcoin uh uh sub
[34:14] subreddit is taken over not by the real
[34:17] bitcoiners as we say it it's like the
[34:20] the
[34:21] bsv guys and it's
[34:25] like how how far are we in Bitcoin is
[34:28] still still the stage where uh really
[34:32] big enemies could slow down the process
[34:35] of having Bitcoin adopted uh drastically
[34:40] it's like are enemies out there that are
[34:42] big enough for Bitcoin still I think you
[34:45] know you often hear bitcoin's
[34:48] inevitable and um I think I believe yes
[34:52] it is um but I also need to remind
[34:56] myself that it's not necessarily
[34:59] inevitable in the way I see it to
[35:01] be it's going to grow it's going to
[35:05] expand and it it might evolve into
[35:07] something that we can't quite yet grasp
[35:11] or fully comprehend and understand
[35:14] because Bitcoin has taught me if you
[35:17] like um that everything I once new is Up
[35:22] For Debate right I really need to think
[35:25] about what we I been taught as a child
[35:28] in school was there a motivation behind
[35:31] the narratives and the curriculum that I
[35:33] was taught as a kid what has the news
[35:36] told me about the way the world is and
[35:39] who's the enemy in the world and I think
[35:42] you know if I go in there with with that
[35:45] in mind I also need to embrace the fact
[35:48] that there's going to be something
[35:51] happening that might not be what I
[35:55] fantasize it to be and yeah you you've
[35:57] got uh things out there different
[35:59] shitcoins and stuff like that with huge
[36:03] budgets and marketing departments that
[36:06] you know we're up against if you like
[36:09] because we don't actually have a
[36:11] marketing department because you know
[36:13] they need to go into that but I think
[36:16] there's always going to be a
[36:17] counternarrative always no matter what
[36:20] even in a hyper Bitcoin IED World they
[36:23] are going to be counternarratives
[36:24] because people will still be motivated
[36:27] by their own agenda and their own ideas
[36:29] in the world right so I even think once
[36:31] we transition into that which I think
[36:33] you know one day we will probably not in
[36:35] my lifetime but I do feel that we are
[36:38] always going to be up against um you
[36:42] know
[36:43] other Temptations and and the uh
[36:47] direction of Bitcoin so I think that
[36:49] that's where we should sort of really
[36:51] embrace the idea of we actually don't
[36:53] even know what we're getting ourselves
[36:55] into in the future but
[36:57] I hope a good
[36:59] thing yeah and I think uh Bitcoin
[37:02] Embraces critical thinking and that
[37:05] alone is something that is so important
[37:07] for the individual level but also the
[37:10] the societal level um we having an
[37:13] Android yeah but so one thing I would
[37:16] sort of try to get out there if I can
[37:19] and if you can help me provide that as
[37:20] an opportunity to do that is but a
[37:22] message to my fellow bitcoiners if you
[37:24] like is sort of really sort of challenge
[37:27] yourself challenge your own ideas of
[37:29] things because I think sometimes
[37:31] especially on X I see people who seem to
[37:34] sort of attached Bitcoin to their
[37:36] pre-existing Legacy ideas or mindset or
[37:39] you know they haven't really they they
[37:42] they've discovered Bitcoin and then
[37:43] they're like oh yeah that fits and
[37:47] aligns with because Bitcoin will align
[37:49] with anything you want it to or those
[37:50] lead back to bitcoin right all
[37:52] narratives also lead back to bitcoin but
[37:54] if you stick to that same thing without
[37:57] exploring this fascinating Warren that
[37:59] is the Bitcoin rabbit hole then you're
[38:01] going to get stuck in this one place
[38:03] that I think ultimately will be your
[38:06] downfall so I think you know just by
[38:08] walking around exploring the different
[38:10] narratives and different perspectives is
[38:12] the only way that we can actually be
[38:15] critical um critically minded in the
[38:18] space and I think that's when we can uh
[38:21] really truly Embrace and uh Advance the
[38:25] adoption of Bitcoin but sorry I
[38:27] interrupted your question and that's a
[38:28] that's a really hard thing to do oh God
[38:31] like because you're the ego cuz you up
[38:33] against your ego right you're up against
[38:35] you're up against your own reality and
[38:37] it's it's so easy trust me I've done it
[38:39] in my past where I've actually sort of
[38:41] like in my peripheral I know there's
[38:43] something else but it's safer for me
[38:45] just to keep on this path even though
[38:47] there might be another way and uh but
[38:50] really what Bitcoin actually does it
[38:52] provides you the safety net and the
[38:54] strong Foundation to actually you know
[38:55] what look around
[38:57] because you know you can always fall
[38:58] back onto
[38:59] Bitcoin yeah that's uh that's very
[39:03] true um we're having an end routine and
[39:05] that's an interesting uh thing an end
[39:07] routine where the previous guest asked a
[39:09] question for the next
[39:10] guest uh and the previous guest was ason
[39:14] from the relay team
[39:19] you what's up Aron yeah what guy yeah we
[39:24] had on our show to check him out rabbit
[39:25] stories is one of our very first guests
[39:28] yeah I actually before I interviewed him
[39:30] I actually looked at the interview from
[39:32] the rabbit hole stories like I
[39:33] interviewed him yesterday it was it was
[39:36] a fun talk what he want to ask me what's
[39:37] he want to ask me go
[39:40] on I I I made the terrible mistake that
[39:44] I revealed that you are my next guest
[39:48] oh and and and uh he he wanted to ask
[39:52] you uh how is it to be bold do you know
[39:55] what I I hope hope Aron one day you'll
[39:57] find out for yourself my friend um but
[40:00] looking at that beautiful head of hair
[40:02] he has it's going to be highly unlikely
[40:04] but being bold is is you know what
[40:07] sometimes I wake up and like yeah
[40:09] actually it's all right then I See the
[40:11] Light bouncing off my head sometimes and
[40:12] I'm
[40:13] like but yeah all you can do really is
[40:17] Embrace what you can't change and that
[40:19] and that's all I can say right but what
[40:22] I what I you might see it now but now
[40:24] you can start to see I have it's it's
[40:26] maintenance people think oh to be bold
[40:29] it's right you don't have to worry about
[40:30] hairstyles and stuff like that yeah it's
[40:31] true but when you start to have a little
[40:33] bit of like two day grow flot I've got
[40:36] then all your sort of patchy head will
[40:38] will start to reveal itself so you have
[40:39] to constantly shave it it's it's proof
[40:41] of work trust me yeah I had uh in the
[40:46] corona time I needed to cut my
[40:49] hair and so I cut it myself and then it
[40:53] was so horrible that I decided to just
[40:55] cut my com head completely and it was
[40:58] going bold it was interesting to wake up
[41:00] and just have the hair done but it was
[41:03] not but you know what I held on I held
[41:06] on to my hair for far too long it got to
[41:08] the point where I was trying to grow it
[41:09] out into little bits and sort of like
[41:12] hide it and I just had to I just had to
[41:15] embrace the boldness and just go for it
[41:17] one day took a while to get used to uh
[41:20] where can people find you uh and like
[41:23] there's also the the podcast uh you have

[41:41] questioning Bitcoin and then you'll find
[41:43] me there you'll see me popping up just
[41:46] asking random questions that pop into my
[41:48] head now and again sometimes I don't get
[41:50] anything sometimes it blows up but you
