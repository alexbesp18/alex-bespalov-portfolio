[00:00] people are missing the importance of
[00:02] block space control in addition to
[00:04] focusing on building a strategic Bitcoin
[00:06] Reserve I would be building a mining
[00:08] model if as a country I do not have
[00:11] guaranteed access to the base layer
[00:14] owning the Bitcoin could be irrelevant
[00:16] the economic sovereignty of a nation of
[00:19] an individual or company is I believe
[00:21] dependent on them having access to the
[00:24] base layer Bitcoin is built a certain
[00:26] way on purpose and I believe it's the
[00:28] right architectural structure for
[00:30] Bitcoin you could say Bob I want to pre-
[00:33] buby space in the blocks you are going
[00:36] to produce in April the base layer
[00:38] access is a luxury it's not a right
[00:41] there'll always be a door open it might
[00:43] be very expensive and you might have to
[00:45] wait a long time but the door is is
[00:47] always
[00:48] [Music]
[00:52] open so many people talking about
[00:54] strategic Bitcoin Reserve which is great
[00:58] I think people are missing
[01:00] the importance of block space control
[01:03] and the geopolitics around all of that
[01:06] how important is that PL space and like
[01:09] what role will that PL space that scares
[01:12] infrastructure that scarce place in the
[01:15] Bitcoin ecosystem play in in the future
[01:18] so I I think we have to start with you
[01:21] know why is block space scarce how
[01:23] scarce is it and you know what you know
[01:25] what is it really mean and and
[01:28] so um
[01:30] as I think most people probably
[01:31] listening to the show show know um you
[01:33] know every 10 minutes there's a block uh
[01:36] roughly right but that block has got a
[01:39] finite size to
[01:40] it and that size is uh 4 million weight
[01:45] units but what that really means is
[01:48] typically you're going to see 3 to 4,000
[01:50] transactions embedded within that block
[01:53] now you could stretch that in probably a
[01:56] maximum scenario you could probably get
[01:58] north of 10,000
[02:00] but as a practical matter you're
[02:01] typically going to see in that range I I
[02:04] use 4,000 kind of as my typical
[02:07] barometer and I don't think there's a
[02:11] lot that can be done to practically
[02:13] switch that so if we know a block comes
[02:16] on average every 10 minutes and there's
[02:18] about 4,000 transactions in it then we
[02:22] can
[02:23] extrapolate to look at it on an annual
[02:25] basis and say there are about 200
[02:27] million transactions per year that can
[02:30] run through the Bitcoin base layer and I
[02:34] don't believe that there's a lot that
[02:36] can be done to change that number there
[02:39] are some people who disagree with me I
[02:40] want to be you know fair that there are
[02:42] other opinions uh some people think that
[02:45] some of the op codes and things that are
[02:47] being floated around might stretch that
[02:49] number a little more I I personally
[02:51] don't have much optimism for that
[02:53] changing that but so what that means is
[02:57] that at at the base layer you know you
[02:59] know that's really where all the action
[03:01] happens right if you want to if you want
[03:03] to take self- custody has to be a Bas
[03:05] layer transaction you want to
[03:07] consolidate utxos has to be a Bas layer
[03:10] transaction you want to open a lightning
[03:12] Channel Bas layer transaction so all of
[03:16] us around the world have to
[03:18] share those 200 million
[03:21] transactions but there are 8 billion
[03:23] people in the world and there are 330
[03:26] million companies in the world so if we
[03:30] if we look at that we'd say well that
[03:32] math doesn't work really
[03:35] well so um in fact one example I give is
[03:39] if I sat here today and I said I want to
[03:42] give every person in the world some
[03:45] Bitcoin let's say I had enough to do
[03:47] that just hypothetically it would take
[03:49] me about 40
[03:50] years to do to accomplish that using all
[03:54] of the block space and all of the blocks
[03:57] so um we have to do is understand that
[04:01] Bitcoin is built a certain way on
[04:04] purpose and I believe it's the right
[04:06] architectural structure for Bitcoin
[04:09] which
[04:09] is we have a base layer which is the
[04:13] most
[04:15] secure uh area of the network it's
[04:19] access to that is
[04:21] precious um that is you know the
[04:24] equivalent of the bank vault right it's
[04:27] like this is the this is the the thing
[04:30] armies would have to uh fight to get to
[04:34] right in in historical days it's the the
[04:36] central reserves in the US it would be
[04:38] the Fort Knox where all the gold is like
[04:40] this is this is our layer and access to
[04:43] it is very restricted and we we've built
[04:46] a structure or bitcoin's based on a
[04:48] structure of layers where you know
[04:51] things like lightning or liquid sit
[04:53] above it and and we could do side chains
[04:56] we can do all these other things that
[04:59] aot higher level trans higher uh volume
[05:03] of transactions to occur um but maybe
[05:06] with less security or less
[05:08] decentralization okay
[05:10] so the reality is though that we we're
[05:14] all seeing a lot of talk these days
[05:18] about strategic Bitcoin Reserves at the
[05:21] nation state level it's happening in the
[05:23] US I just saw this morning uh someone
[05:26] from France had given a a a a speech to
[05:29] the EU Parliament about you know
[05:32] prodding you know the EU to get with it
[05:36] and and start doing something
[05:38] similar I think that's great I I have no
[05:41] problem with
[05:42] it however I think if if I were the head
[05:46] of state doesn't really matter what
[05:48] country of the world it is if I was the
[05:50] head of state what I would be
[05:52] doing is at a minimum in addition to
[05:56] focusing on building a strategic Bitcoin
[05:58] Reserve I would be
[06:00] building a mining
[06:03] model and the reason is that if if as a
[06:09] country I do not have guaranteed access
[06:13] to the base layer owning the Bitcoin
[06:15] could be irrelevant so the and what I'm
[06:18] trying to get at is the economic
[06:21] sovereignty of a
[06:23] nation of an individual or or a CO
[06:26] company but we're talking nation state
[06:28] right now is I believe dependent on them
[06:31] having access to the base layer and the
[06:34] only way for them to do that is to have
[06:37] access and control of some of the block
[06:41] Spas via mining so just as a
[06:44] hypothetical if I was the uh president
[06:47] of Algeria say a small nation I would be
[06:52] actively pursuing e building a little
[06:55] mining infrastructure myself but also
[06:58] doing something to attract mining into
[07:02] my country a country of that size I
[07:04] might have the goal of owning one
[07:06] quarter of 1% of the world's hash
[07:10] rate and and the reason would be if I
[07:13] own one quarter of the world's hash rate
[07:17] there are um let's see what a little
[07:20] over a thousand blocks produced every
[07:23] week if we just look at it that way and
[07:26] if I own one quarter of 1% of those I'm
[07:29] GNA produce about three blocks a
[07:32] week so what that means is at the
[07:35] country of Algeria in this particular
[07:38] example by having control of that hash
[07:43] raate it means they can create what are
[07:46] called The Block templates they can
[07:48] decide what transactions go in to all
[07:52] the blocks they're trying to create and
[07:53] about three times per week it would be
[07:56] the transactions they selected that
[07:58] could get
[08:00] get included in the block and so even if
[08:03] there was an international ban on
[08:06] Commerce I was I was blacklisted as a
[08:09] country I was in disfavor with the west
[08:12] or with China or with Russia there's
[08:14] nothing any of them could do to stop me
[08:17] me and me from doing Commerce with the
[08:21] rest of the world and by extension I
[08:24] would what I would do is I would have a
[08:26] set of rules for the blocks I was
[08:28] creating Algeria that said first the
[08:31] business of the Algerian government
[08:33] those transactions get put in second
[08:36] probably the more significant
[08:40] corporations within the country I'm
[08:42] going to prioritize their transactions
[08:44] and then third the citizens of Algeria
[08:47] would would maybe be next and so it I I
[08:52] use the term economic
[08:54] sovereignty to kind of describe this
[08:58] that it's not really a form of warfare
[09:01] but I think it's a it's a way of
[09:03] Defending yourself um against economic
[09:06] persecution in the International
[09:08] Community and guaranteeing that you have
[09:12] um that you have access because if we
[09:15] take the opposite scenario let's say
[09:18] you're Algeria you have no mining but
[09:20] let's say you own 40,000
[09:22] Bitcoin well it may be difficult for you
[09:26] to get access to that Bitcoin
[09:29] and use it to your advantage um if you
[09:32] don't have access to block space
[09:35] especially if other countries join in
[09:38] and um by the way I I don't necessarily
[09:40] like this I don't love the idea as a
[09:42] bitcoiner of a bunch of nation states
[09:44] controlling a bunch of the hash power
[09:46] it's not a very bitcoiner thing to do um
[09:49] to a certain degree I I I've even had
[09:52] internal battles with myself about you
[09:53] know should I be talking about
[09:55] this but I think the reason I want to
[09:58] talk about it
[10:00] is that I do think there are things we
[10:01] can do about it and and we have to make
[10:04] sure that that we don't let all the hash
[10:08] rate go that direction that that we can
[10:11] as a community preserve some degree of
[10:15] individual freedom and in individual
[10:17] economic sovereignty by making sure the
[10:20] mining network doesn't get completely
[10:22] controlled by the nation state level
[10:26] that's super interesting there there are
[10:27] many directions uh want to go now but um
[10:30] maybe let's start with that we talked
[10:33] about Str strategic Bitcoin reserve and
[10:36] uh Donald Trump and uh the The Mining
[10:40] and he said one thing that we laughed at
[10:44] uh when he said we will mine all the
[10:45] Bitcoin in in America yeah but that's
[10:48] basically uh the thing that like what
[10:51] you are saying is like the the USA
[10:54] should fight for mining all the Bitcoin
[10:56] even they will not never get to all the
[10:58] Bitcoin but uh should fight to get as
[11:00] many Bitcoin miners as possible in into
[11:04] the USA real and maybe even like on a
[11:07] nation level is is that do do you think
[11:10] he got it that that game theory aspect
[11:12] of it or was just something that he
[11:15] said I doubt he got it but you know
[11:18] sometimes you get the right answer for
[11:19] the wrong reason so so I I don't think
[11:24] he understands uh what I'm talking about
[11:28] here but it but it would that that would
[11:30] be the result because I know this will
[11:32] this will
[11:33] probably uh sound controversial I guess
[11:36] it probably is controversial but I'll go
[11:38] back to the Algeria
[11:41] example if I was the president of
[11:43] Algeria and there was a a magic Genie
[11:47] and the magic Genie
[11:48] said you can
[11:50] have 40,000 Bitcoin right now just boom
[11:54] you own it here are your keys you have
[11:56] 40,000 Bitcoin or
[11:59] you can have one quarter of
[12:03] 1% of all the world's hash rate for the
[12:05] next Century which do you
[12:09] choose I would pick the hatch
[12:12] rate
[12:13] because just owning the Bitcoin does
[12:17] not protect the sovereignty of my
[12:20] country and its people but owning the
[12:23] hash rate does so like uh owning hash
[12:26] rate uh is is more important then owning
[12:30] the Bitcoin itself at the nation state
[12:32] level yes I think at the nation state
[12:35] level but individual level not because
[12:38] uh it's it's it's better it's it's a
[12:41] better decision to directly buy the
[12:43] Bitcoin yeah well I would still I mean
[12:45] if it were possible at the individual
[12:47] level to do that I would I would
[12:50] actually probably
[12:51] even then I'd have to think about it a
[12:54] little more but nation state level I
[12:56] think the answer is clear probably at
[12:59] the individual
[13:01] level uh I would still pick the hash
[13:04] rate because I I believe that
[13:07] um hash rate will be
[13:11] monetized it
[13:13] is when you think about so I am a minor
[13:16] I get you know just to preface it I
[13:19] don't know if we've talked about that
[13:20] but I am a minor um I'm sometimes I like
[13:24] to say like I am my mining operation is
[13:27] big enough to not be small but probably
[13:29] not big enough to be big so you know we
[13:32] we're a medium-sized commercial minor
[13:35] private minor we control hash rate um
[13:38] we're big enough that in the course of a
[13:41] year we will win blocks we'll win
[13:44] several blocks directly from my
[13:46] operations we publish that sometimes
[13:48] that we do because we use ocean which
[13:50] I'm also on the board of directors of
[13:52] which is a unique aspect of ocean it's a
[13:55] sidelight is that you know when you win
[13:58] a block with ocean like we know exactly
[14:01] what machine won the block no other pool
[14:03] offers that so I know when I won the
[14:06] block and I create my own templates too
[14:09] so I guess what I'm getting at is over
[14:12] over time I I believe when you are a
[14:15] hasher when you do create
[14:17] templates you have a certain
[14:19] responsibility there's a
[14:21] certain Bitcoin
[14:24] citizenship um that
[14:27] that I I take on when I do that I I I
[14:31] believe I must act ethically and act in
[14:34] the best interest of Bitcoin by by doing
[14:38] this
[14:39] um that
[14:41] said I believe there will be numerous
[14:44] ways for Block
[14:46] space to be
[14:49] monetized going forward and that those
[14:52] that control it will be the ones that
[14:56] get to monetize it so
[14:59] um the simple one is you know for
[15:02] instance a product that we're working on
[15:04] right now which is a block space forward
[15:06] idea which is it says um you know let's
[15:11] say we're we're here on uh in mid
[15:13] December of
[15:15] 2024 but let's say um you Robin are
[15:19] running a business and you know that in
[15:21] April of this year you're going to have
[15:25] to do a lot of Bas layer transactions so
[15:30] in the present world this means that you
[15:33] would um have this in today's
[15:37] environment you have this big
[15:39] unknown you don't actually know let's
[15:42] say you have to do thousands of them for
[15:44] for as an example you have to do
[15:45] thousands of Bas layer transactions in
[15:47] April you don't know what it's going to
[15:49] cost you to do those
[15:50] transactions and you actually don't know
[15:52] for sure whether or not you're going to
[15:54] be able to do them because um one as is
[15:58] obvious we don't know how big the
[16:00] backlog is going to be how many
[16:01] transactions are pending in the mempool
[16:04] and um we don't know what the quote
[16:08] unquote uh bid
[16:11] price for transactions fees will be to
[16:14] be at the upper end of the priority but
[16:17] what you also don't know and I think
[16:20] people forget is the people that create
[16:22] the block templates can choose any
[16:25] transaction they want they don't have to
[16:27] pick the most expensive ones that's what
[16:30] I was talking about in the Algeria
[16:32] example right maybe we reach a point in
[16:34] time I think we will where the people
[16:39] making block template creation decisions
[16:42] what transactions go in blocks aren't
[16:45] motivated by the block reward they're
[16:48] not motivated by how much they're being
[16:50] paid in transactions fees their
[16:52] motivation may be completely different a
[16:55] good example would be if um if if the
[16:59] country of Algeria was in a situation
[17:04] where uh they had been kicked out of the
[17:06] Swift system and they needed to
[17:09] buy uh wheat from Russia to feed their
[17:14] people well uh if if the
[17:19] the the global monetary system running
[17:22] the Fiat system the global Fiat system
[17:25] was not allowing that transaction to go
[17:27] through then
[17:29] they're going to prioritize that
[17:31] purchase of wheat from Russia on the
[17:33] Bitcoin Network and and it won't matter
[17:38] how much money if if you were at the
[17:40] same time trying to get into a block for
[17:44] at least their template it won't matter
[17:46] how much you're offering they don't care
[17:47] they need to get the wheat to their
[17:49] people so they're going to make that
[17:51] transaction go through so the same same
[17:55] thing applies I think at the individual
[17:58] level where
[18:00] um you you may want to guarantee that so
[18:02] me as a minor let's just keep it simple
[18:06] if if I own 1% of the world's hash rate
[18:09] that means on average I'm going to
[18:11] produce one and a half blocks per
[18:13] day so you could come to me now in
[18:17] December and you could say
[18:20] Bob I want to pre- buby space in the
[18:24] blocks you are going to produce in April
[18:26] and we will agree today
[18:29] on a price let's say of 25 SATs per
[18:32] Vite now I will be contractually
[18:36] obligated
[18:38] to honor that price for you when the
[18:41] time
[18:42] comes and I must prioritize your
[18:45] transactions above anything else in the
[18:48] blocks I produce in
[18:49] April so this essentially Futures
[18:54] Market um will allow both the producers
[18:59] of block space and the buyers of blocks
[19:03] space to now start looking forward and
[19:07] guaranteeing access to to to block space
[19:10] and guaranteeing revenue streams for
[19:12] Miners and cost structures for
[19:15] users and uh I think this is part of a
[19:19] healthy
[19:21] ecosystem that we can't I think we as
[19:24] bitcoiners will often talk about
[19:25] hyperbitcoinization and like these sorts
[19:28] of things well
[19:30] if if if we're in a hyperbitcoinization
[19:38] as an
[19:40] example to just accept that whenever
[19:44] they need to make a transaction they're
[19:46] going to go into an open realtime market
[19:49] and bid for a
[19:52] transaction they they they they won't
[19:55] hyper Bitcoin eyes until they know
[19:59] they can have predictability both on the
[20:01] cost and the availability of block
[20:03] space so um so anyway I I think when you
[20:07] start thinking about these types of
[20:10] things start realizing the
[20:13] [Music]
[20:14] implications of block space control like
[20:18] how important it can be and how not not
[20:22] having it could be existential to a
[20:24] company or a uh a nation
[20:28] and having control like we we need
[20:32] organizations and
[20:34] individuals controlling at least some of
[20:37] the block space that live within the
[20:40] Bitcoin ethos that that will
[20:43] Preserve at least the the spirit of the
[20:49] world we have today because um if we
[20:53] don't it I'm not saying next Tuesday but
[20:57] over time it will migr to them the the
[21:00] the the financial motivations and the uh
[21:04] Power
[21:06] motivations will drive them toward
[21:09] taking block space
[21:10] control that's super interesting I never
[21:13] heard about the possibility of like a
[21:15] future Market uh for Block space that's
[21:18] also super interesting um which brings
[21:21] us to an interesting topic where we have
[21:24] mining pool
[21:26] sensorization um basically two I think
[21:29] the two biggest ones control like 53% I
[21:31] think I looked a few days ago something
[21:34] like that and there's like a third
[21:35] fourth a really big one um H how will
[21:39] this develop who who will control that
[21:43] PL space in the future and especially
[21:47] also with like we often talk about big
[21:51] coroporation just being a longer arm of
[21:54] of actually the government uh which then
[21:57] if the mining operations centralized to
[22:00] like really big corporations and then
[22:02] they're basically just the government uh
[22:05] that could develop into a problem uh
[22:08] long term I guess
[22:10] absolutely so first you you are correct
[22:13] that we have over 50% controlled by the
[22:17] top two probably even more daunting and
[22:20] scary is that 90% is controlled by
[22:24] six so and of those six two are American
[22:28] Luxor and and Foundry for
[22:33] Chinese um so and and the chines
[22:37] collectively are over 50% so you have
[22:41] you know uh you have multiple ways in
[22:46] which the current construct of the
[22:50] mining pools could consolidate and cause
[22:54] problems I don't believe at this point
[22:57] that there are
[22:59] problems so it's it's a
[23:01] hypothetical situation most bitcoiners
[23:05] understand have heard of 51% attack I
[23:08] don't think 51% attack is really a
[23:11] legitimate concern um not saying we
[23:14] shouldn't ever think about it but I
[23:16] don't think it's really a legitimate
[23:17] concern it has more to do with control
[23:20] of the block space of censorship of like
[23:23] these sort of things happening and
[23:25] becoming more more real the real issue
[23:29] is I I mentioned it before and I I
[23:31] probably should reiterate block block
[23:33] template creation is really in my mind
[23:36] the issue
[23:38] so so each pool can pick what block it
[23:43] wants to try to M so the way to think
[23:46] about this is if there are like roughly
[23:51] 250,000 unconfirmed transactions right
[23:54] now hoping to get into a block and each
[23:56] block can only have roughly 4 ,000 there
[23:59] has to be some criteria upon which those
[24:02] 4,000 get picked right so um you know
[24:06] less than 2% of the transactions are
[24:08] going to get picked and put in the block
[24:10] so which which ones you going to pick in
[24:12] today's current world the formula used
[24:17] by almost all the pools is number one do
[24:21] they have any of their own transactions
[24:24] they need to include so they they put
[24:26] those in first okay
[24:29] um and those would typically be to pay
[24:31] out miners like so they they they may
[24:33] owe money to miners for previous work so
[24:36] they'll slap that in there um those go
[24:41] first and then for the most part they
[24:44] will look at those offering the highest
[24:48] fees and put those in until the block is
[24:50] full and that's what they will try to
[24:53] mine but as I mentioned before there's
[24:56] there are no rules about what
[24:59] transactions can can uh can be picked
[25:02] each individual Miner mining pool
[25:07] template Creator gets to make that
[25:08] choice so um I mentioned I'm on the
[25:11] board of directors of ocean and also an
[25:12] investor in Ocean I always want to be
[25:14] transparent with people about that um
[25:16] and we mine at Barefoot mining my
[25:18] company primarily with
[25:20] ocean ocean offer introduce something in
[25:24] September called datam and what it what
[25:27] datam does does is it it allows instead
[25:31] of the pool making the template choices
[25:36] it allows each individual minor the
[25:39] people that actually have the hash rate
[25:41] can make a template so I'm I'm mining
[25:45] with a template chosen by Barefoot with
[25:48] our
[25:49] criteria um and Robin if you if you were
[25:52] in the
[25:53] pool um and and you could create your
[25:57] own template we'd be mining together so
[26:00] if I win I get
[26:04] the percentage of the reward equivalent
[26:08] to my hash rate contribution and and you
[26:13] get and the same for you it doesn't
[26:15] matter who created the template we share
[26:17] the proceeds based on you know the pool
[26:20] so this is a um a big innovation because
[26:24] what it what it allows us to do is go
[26:27] from a world where there really are just
[26:30] primarily six companies in the world
[26:32] those pools I mentioned at the beginning
[26:34] that are creating the templates so now
[26:36] even though ocean is a pretty small pool
[26:38] we only control about one half a one% of
[26:40] the world's um hash rate right now but
[26:44] we're creating dozens of different
[26:47] templates today within that so the the
[26:50] the people in there there's dozens of
[26:52] different people who are creating
[26:54] individual templates so we've had an
[26:56] order of magnitude change with in the
[26:58] Bitcoin Network about how many different
[27:01] template choices are being made and
[27:03] that's very important because obviously
[27:06] we hope ocean grows I also hope other
[27:09] pool even though I'm I'm in Ocean I want
[27:11] other pools to come up I want other
[27:13] pools to offer template choice to miners
[27:17] because as a bitcoiner I know that what
[27:19] we need is we need hundreds if not
[27:23] thousands of different template creation
[27:26] points and we need to assume as you said
[27:29] these big
[27:30] corporations that are mining whether
[27:33] they're the US public mining companies
[27:36] or the um the the larger mining pools
[27:41] it's highly likely that either directly
[27:44] or
[27:45] indirectly they become arms of some
[27:48] nation state or or heavily influenced by
[27:51] some nation state and that's where we
[27:53] see what I would call true censorship
[27:56] coming in which means you know there are
[27:59] Blacklist addresses or wh list addresses
[28:02] like those sort of things that are are
[28:05] predicating the template
[28:08] choice and that's that's where the
[28:10] danger really comes
[28:13] in I think
[28:15] like what I usually hear is that we need
[28:18] way more pools uh and with more pools
[28:21] also more templates and and all those
[28:23] things as you just mentioned um in in
[28:26] general when we look at my mining there
[28:29] are really big and I think you actually
[28:33] uh it came up in in a recent podast but
[28:35] I think that model actually comes from
[28:36] you like with horses and rabbits like
[28:38] the different sizes of it that comes
[28:41] from you
[28:43] um we need more pools but is it also
[28:46] important to have different uh sizes of
[28:49] the mining operations and maybe also
[28:51] more smaller ones like home miners that
[28:54] have like a few miners at home I don't
[28:56] know heating up there their pools
[28:58] heating up their water uh and maybe
[29:01] heating up their their their Apartments
[29:03] is is is that important that we not only
[29:05] decentralize the pools but also
[29:06] decentralize the location of of the
[29:08] miners and how big they
[29:10] are yes for
[29:13] sure the what you're referring to is um
[29:17] uh several years ago I came up I was
[29:19] looking at kind of the landscape and I
[29:21] realize there were three in my mind
[29:24] three distinct classes of miners
[29:28] emerging um one I I labeled the rabbits
[29:32] and that's the individual home
[29:34] miners they might have one or two or
[29:36] three or something on that order and I I
[29:40] call them rabbits because while
[29:43] individually they don't have much power
[29:46] collectively they can they can be
[29:49] powerful right so it's like a if you
[29:51] think of a farmer who has a field of of
[29:54] cabbage if there's one rabbit in the
[29:56] field eating eating the cabbage is not
[29:58] really a problem but if he has thousands
[30:01] of rabbits eating the Cabbage you can
[30:05] suddenly realize that the rabbits can be
[30:07] very
[30:08] powerful if you're trying to if you're
[30:11] that that that farmer and you go out and
[30:14] you start trying to shoot the
[30:16] rabbits because they're eating your
[30:18] cabbage you'll hit a couple but you'll
[30:22] never hit them all and and the moment
[30:24] you start shooting they scatter and it
[30:27] gets really hard to find them they can
[30:29] hide easily and so so they're very
[30:32] they're very important part of the
[30:35] infrastructure because in a in a state a
[30:40] world
[30:42] state where mining has
[30:48] become very uh it may be illegal or
[30:52] frowned
[30:53] upon they can they can still provide
[30:58] this in a in a in a discreet way that is
[31:01] is very difficult to find on the other
[31:04] end we have what I call the elephants
[31:06] now that probably sounds obvious but if
[31:09] if you take let's say a riot and they
[31:11] have a a a site with 400 megawatt it's a
[31:15] big and powerful site
[31:17] clearly but it it's
[31:21] immobile right just like an elephant and
[31:24] if you if you decide you want to start
[31:26] hunting them it's pretty easy to find
[31:29] them and it's pretty easy to shoot
[31:31] them um so big and powerful and they
[31:35] take forever to grow so so the the the
[31:40] elephants they can't reproduce quickly
[31:43] they can't multiply and grow but the
[31:45] rabbits on the other hand they can they
[31:47] can multiply
[31:49] quickly in the middle are what I call
[31:52] horses it's where my company focuses
[31:55] horses are small to medium siiz
[31:57] commercial operations they might be a
[32:00] few hundred kilowatt to several
[32:02] megawatts in
[32:04] size but they may be all around you
[32:08] right now you still don't even know that
[32:10] they're there I give this example like
[32:13] we have a we have a site that operates
[32:16] in two containers in just outside the
[32:20] back of a Burrito Factory in South
[32:22] Dakota
[32:24] so the the people in that Community
[32:26] don't even know it's they just think
[32:28] it's part of the Burrito Factory it's
[32:31] you know and and we have we have many
[32:35] many sites like that almost all of the
[32:37] Barefoot sites are just like that
[32:39] they're a megawatt here and two
[32:42] megawatts there and half a megawatts
[32:43] there and and um they just blend in with
[32:49] everything going on um but obviously
[32:51] they're powerful you know we we can we
[32:54] can in any one of those locations have
[32:57] 10 tens of pah hases in current with
[32:59] using the current technology we can have
[33:01] tens of pah hases of mining power there
[33:05] and uh you know again they're they're
[33:09] they're kind of hard to hunt because you
[33:13] you can't find them you have to work
[33:14] really hard to even find where they
[33:17] are and if we hear that that we're being
[33:20] hunted like if there are Hunters looking
[33:22] for us in a given area we can pick up
[33:24] and move very quickly where we any of
[33:26] our sites probably within a matter in an
[33:29] emergency probably within a matter of 72
[33:31] hours we could be gone um so the the um
[33:38] I think the if we think of more of a
[33:41] dystopian kind of world right which
[33:44] we're not in today but I think we have
[33:46] to think about this we have to be um
[33:50] very
[33:51] judicious in being security
[33:55] conscious and just because the world
[33:58] seems to be
[33:59] blowing in with favorable winds toward
[34:02] Bitcoin right now it could
[34:05] change and and
[34:08] so uh so my my premise is we have to
[34:11] have these different parts there because
[34:14] if the elephants get
[34:16] hunted we we can you can destroy a
[34:21] massive piece of the infrastructure very
[34:22] very quickly and if there are no rabbits
[34:24] and horses left if we let only the
[34:27] elephants EX exist that's a huge problem
[34:29] from a hash power perspective but the
[34:32] other part is the template creation
[34:35] because if we can also have the rabbits
[34:37] and the horses being template
[34:40] creators that really provides us with a
[34:43] lot of security and
[34:45] so I I would feel best with well over
[34:48] 50% of the hash rate in the hands of
[34:51] horses and rabbits but I feel like
[34:54] 30% is kind of the bare minimum as a
[34:56] community should um we should allow and
[35:00] I hope like you you started this
[35:02] conversation talking about the rabbits I
[35:05] hope we see a return there was a there
[35:07] was a period of time early in Bitcoin
[35:09] when almost everybody mined at least a
[35:12] little bit and and I hope we have that
[35:15] again where we have millions of rabbits
[35:17] out there and some may just mine in the
[35:20] winter months when the electricity
[35:22] prices are right or they need the heat
[35:24] in their home and others may may uh like
[35:27] you said they they
[35:29] may do it to uh for for their pool
[35:33] heater or a small business that uses
[35:37] them to um dry beef jerky or or or
[35:44] create heat for a greenhouse we actually
[35:46] have a small operation that does that
[35:48] already um like the these are really
[35:50] important for the long-term security of
[35:53] the
[35:54] network what what is the I mean it's
[35:58] probably not you probably cannot
[36:00] pinpoint an exact number but how is the
[36:03] distributed uh distribution right now
[36:06] currently with like rabbits horses and
[36:08] and and elephants well we know that 30%
[36:11] of the hash rate is controlled by the US
[36:14] public
[36:15] miners so we start right there there are
[36:20] there are some other big
[36:22] organizations around the world that are
[36:24] private that are also have significant
[36:26] hash rates I think we're in the
[36:28] neighborhood of 45 to 50% that would
[36:31] probably fall into the elephant category
[36:35] today I think the rabbits are well under
[36:38] 10%
[36:40] today um I would really like to see that
[36:42] number increase you know so so but in
[36:46] crude terms maybe we could say 50% in
[36:48] elephants 40% in horses and 10% in
[36:51] rabbits something on that order I
[36:54] partnered up with coin vigilante this
[36:57] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[37:00] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[37:03] look at that beauty I love it so much
[37:05] coin vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin
[37:09] watch that's the perfect subtle elegent
[37:11] way to go out there and show that you
[37:14] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[37:17] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[37:20] dropped a completely new and amazing
[37:23] Genesis edition of their watch
[37:26] collections you have the date of the
[37:28] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[37:31] and of course also the block height and
[37:34] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[37:37] level of detail they put in in this
[37:40] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[37:42] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[37:46] down in the descriptions I love those
[37:48] watches so so much if you watch or
[37:51] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[37:54] I'll guess you already bought some
[37:56] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[37:58] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[38:02] in a hardware wallet my personal
[38:04] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[38:05] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[38:08] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[38:10] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[38:13] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[38:17] with the code Robin at the checkout
[38:19] visit bitbox Doss SL robobin to get your
[38:24] bitbox and the next step is to really
[38:26] level up your soft
[38:28] as an individual you have to have the
[38:30] most secure self custody setup you have
[38:33] to secure your own devices you have to
[38:36] protect your privacy you have to set up
[38:39] an inheritance plan and depending on
[38:41] where you live you even want to have a
[38:43] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[38:46] in case something goes really really
[38:48] wrong and through all those steps the
[38:50] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[38:53] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[38:56] way.com
[38:57] Partners SL robobin you even get a 30
[39:00] minute free call to find out how you can
[39:03] level up your sovereignty is it when
[39:07] when we look at how someone can get
[39:10] exposure to to Bitcoin mining uh there
[39:12] are now several options even uh you can
[39:15] just buy a Min yourself at home but
[39:17] there's a lot of technical stuff that
[39:19] that you have to do then there's um
[39:22] mining as a service providers um how you
[39:26] call SS Mining and abundant mines there
[39:29] there's some of those uh you can buy
[39:32] mining stocks but then you contribute to
[39:35] the elephants and and not to the other
[39:38] ones how how would you suggest someone
[39:40] that maybe has the financial capacity of
[39:44] like5 to
[39:46] 50,000 and they want to start mining uh
[39:50] what what is the best way to like get in
[39:52] there uh and and do you have to uh set
[39:56] it up yourself at home
[39:57] like what what are the options there
[39:59] okay so um it's a great question I'm I'm
[40:03] I'm really glad you asked this one I
[40:05] think that if if you have very limited
[40:09] funds let's let's go even smaller let's
[40:12] say you only have
[40:13] $500 um well if you have
[40:16] $500 I would suggest buying a used S9 or
[40:22] a bit ax or a future well a future bits
[40:25] a little more expensive but something
[40:27] like like that and
[40:29] just set it up to run it you're not
[40:32] going to make any money I want to be
[40:34] transparent with you're not going to
[40:35] make any money but what you will do is
[40:37] you will participate in the
[40:41] network and you're going to learn a
[40:44] tremendous amount by doing that it will
[40:47] you know you're I think mining is is
[40:50] this black box to most people but once
[40:54] you start mining you will understand and
[40:58] so much more about how the network
[41:01] works so um I I would suggest that to
[41:05] almost everybody if you if you consider
[41:08] yourself a
[41:09] bitcoiner then you need to at least go
[41:11] through the mining experience and do it
[41:13] for a little
[41:14] while so that's number one number two
[41:17] now if you have let's say
[41:19] $5,000 well if you have
[41:22] $5,000 my guess is most individuals do
[41:26] not have
[41:27] now now now you're more making an
[41:30] investment for financial return the
[41:31] first one was an educational return this
[41:34] this this next one is a financial return
[41:36] if you're investing
[41:38] $5,000 um I think you're going to be
[41:40] best off like you mentioned SAS I want
[41:42] to be I I am an advisor to that company
[41:45] as well but there are there are others
[41:46] there's several others you can go out
[41:48] and you can you can buy a minor the the
[41:53] the positive is you are contributing
[41:54] hash rate to the network you can make
[41:58] money doing it um if you pick the right
[42:01] company with the right relationship you
[42:02] can make money at it you're probably not
[42:05] going to be part of the block template
[42:07] creation thing though but you know
[42:09] you're at least contributing the hash
[42:11] rate if you have um like
[42:15] $50,000 which was the other end of the
[42:17] spectrum you said now you're getting to
[42:19] the point where I would
[42:21] suggest investing in a private mining
[42:24] company so like for instance bare mining
[42:27] we are constantly putting up new
[42:30] projects and we are bringing in
[42:33] investors from the outside and it's
[42:36] usually around 50 to $100,000 is usually
[42:39] the minimum investment level and what we
[42:42] do in that case is now you're part of a
[42:44] let's say we're bringing up a 2 megawatt
[42:47] site in uh
[42:48] Pennsylvania I'm doing a lot of work in
[42:50] Pennsyvania in the US right now so we
[42:53] bringing up that site you invest in the
[42:56] in the entity
[42:58] um you can at least have a voice about
[43:00] things like template creation you can
[43:02] talk to me you can say this is this is
[43:04] where I sit
[43:06] philosophically um and you get the and
[43:09] you get paid in
[43:11] Bitcoin
[43:13] so um you know and and then I guess the
[43:16] third thing is uh you could also invest
[43:20] in the miners in the in the public
[43:22] miners personally I don't really view
[43:25] that as in investment in mining I think
[43:30] you're because it's a it's a Fiat
[43:34] investment with a Fiat
[43:36] return um a lot of these
[43:40] companies I have philosophical issues
[43:43] with many of them because I I don't see
[43:46] them as very Bitcoin Centric companies
[43:50] often I see them making decisions that
[43:53] are not always in the best interests of
[43:55] Bitcoin
[43:57] so if you do do that I would say you
[43:59] know really do your research and and
[44:02] really ask yourself if What that
[44:05] particular company is doing aligns with
[44:08] your ethos and what you want um because
[44:11] it might not it might be that they're
[44:14] just things to look for are they mining
[44:15] shitcoins in addition to bitcoin are
[44:19] they um have they been financially
[44:24] responsible um in other words
[44:28] if if companies are mining at a loss
[44:32] they're creating pressure and and
[44:35] they're what they're doing is they're
[44:36] using the Public's
[44:39] money and cheap Fiat money to allow
[44:44] themselves to operate at a loss while
[44:46] paying themselves really high
[44:48] salaries then they're putting pressure
[44:51] on the private Miners and making it
[44:52] harder for the private miners who are um
[44:56] who who who who who must operate at a
[44:59] profit um so those are just things that
[45:02] I would say if you decide to invest in
[45:04] public miners you know obviously it's a
[45:06] it's a free world you go do what you
[45:08] want but make sure that they're
[45:10] philosophically aligned with
[45:13] you interesting um a for experiment
[45:18] uh when we're now having a world where
[45:21] everyone is into Bitcoin and we are
[45:24] using it every day and we actually have
[45:26] a a a lot of lot of competing people in
[45:30] Bitcoin mining for the block space and
[45:33] you have to pay high fees and all the
[45:34] all all those things that we currently
[45:37] don't have right now it's comparably
[45:40] cheap to make a Bitcoin transaction uh
[45:42] depends on how you how you uh compare it
[45:45] to uh but it's possible for most people
[45:49] um what happens once we have let's say a
[45:55] Bitcoin standard hper bitcon world uh
[45:58] with block space uh where only a limited
[46:01] amount of people can even transact on
[46:05] the base layer because they are priced
[46:06] out of that I don't know what the number
[46:08] is how many millions of Institutions and
[46:11] individuals will be priced in and how
[46:13] many is will be priced out but what
[46:15] happens in in that world and what also
[46:17] what what are you seeing in terms of uh
[46:20] who who has to move then upwards the
[46:23] layer with lightning and liquid and
[46:24] other things like that yeah that really
[46:27] is the the I think the big philosophical
[46:30] question right so we
[46:33] had we had the Block siiz Wars 2017 is
[46:38] time
[46:39] period and part of that was over this
[46:42] architectural decision how big should a
[46:44] block be should they should they grow in
[46:47] size with
[46:48] time and there's this balance between
[46:51] theoretically you could make blocks as
[46:52] big as you wanted and give everybody Bas
[46:55] layer access but then problem
[46:58] becomes as the subsidy goes away which
[47:01] it's getting very very small now will
[47:04] there be monetization opportunities for
[47:06] the miners
[47:08] to um to make enough money to have a
[47:11] secure network so that's that's the
[47:14] trade-off because if if you think of
[47:17] block space as let's say big enough to
[47:20] always
[47:22] accommodate anybody's needs instantly at
[47:25] close to free well then how does a minor
[47:29] make money we it it it it
[47:32] doesn't so in other words the scarcity
[47:35] of block space is very important and
[47:38] picking the right level of scarcity like
[47:40] we picked people think of Bitcoin and
[47:43] the 21 million they get that scarcity
[47:46] right away right and and nobody wants 22
[47:52] million or 100 million or a billion
[47:54] Bitcoin right we would all resist that
[47:57] very very strongly so we kind of have
[47:59] the same situation with block
[48:01] space was you could think of the block
[48:04] space
[48:05] wars as a fight
[48:08] about the scarcity the appropriate
[48:11] scarcity level for Block
[48:13] space and and and settling on the
[48:17] equivalent of the 21 million for Block
[48:21] space and the end result is 4 million
[48:25] weight units every 10 minutes that's the
[48:28] that's the scarcity level you can also
[48:30] look like if we look at the word subsidy
[48:32] most people I think think of the word
[48:34] subsidy as it pertains to bitcoin and
[48:38] they think of the subsidy as a reward to
[48:40] the
[48:41] minor right so so first it was 50
[48:45] Bitcoin per block and then it became 25
[48:49] and then 12 and now we're at
[48:51] 3.125 that's the subsidy level um but
[48:55] that's not completely
[48:58] true that subsidy also was to
[49:03] encourage users of the
[49:06] network so it was it was essentially a
[49:09] subsidy to the miners but to give
[49:13] users unfettered unrestricted access to
[49:17] the base layer for free whenever they
[49:20] wanted it right the early users got that
[49:23] luxury there's a there's a great saying
[49:27] um that I I use sometimes when I discuss
[49:29] this and it says a luxury once enjoyed
[49:32] becomes a
[49:34] necessity and so in other words like
[49:37] when you fly first class in an airplane
[49:40] you want to fly first class every time
[49:42] right when if you've written in a
[49:44] Rolls-Royce you go oh I think I'd like
[49:46] to write in a Rolls-Royce every time um
[49:49] well that's kind of what we've been
[49:51] doing is we've as a Bitcoin
[49:54] Community users of the
[49:57] Network have been riding in the r rolls
[50:00] rice of digital networks for free
[50:04] essentially for free whenever they
[50:06] wanted for 15
[50:07] years well now the subsidy is dropping
[50:11] to the
[50:12] point where it's not free anymore and
[50:16] the number of people wanting access to
[50:18] it were also competing there so um what
[50:23] I'm trying to say in a very uh
[50:26] roundabout way is
[50:28] that this is a luxury the base layer
[50:33] access is a luxury it's not a right it's
[50:37] not a um
[50:41] uh it's not something that we can give
[50:45] away and it's always available the door
[50:50] is always open especially if we if we
[50:53] keep the template creation the way I
[50:54] talked about they'll always be a door
[50:56] door open it might be very expensive and
[50:59] you might have to wait a long time but
[51:01] the door is is always
[51:03] open um but that's the way that that
[51:08] Bitcoin has been built like it or not
[51:12] it's what we have and the
[51:16] dream that I think we falsely
[51:20] profess
[51:21] of you know everybody should hold their
[51:24] own keys if it's if it's not your keys
[51:27] not your Bitcoin we we set a standard
[51:30] that isn't realistic for 8 billion
[51:32] people and 330 million companies it's
[51:35] just the base layer is not constructed
[51:37] that way um and if it were it wouldn't
[51:41] be scarce and we would have a really
[51:43] difficult time securing it like so this
[51:46] this is what the architectural
[51:49] tradeoff um I believe what so Satoshi
[51:53] created was genius in that finding this
[51:59] balance in the network is really really
[52:02] difficult and it got fine tuned a little
[52:05] with segwit although you could actually
[52:07] argue segwit was a mistake but it got
[52:09] fine-tuned a little bit with segwit but
[52:12] we still basically preserve this same
[52:14] balance we have the same subsidy
[52:16] schedule the same dependence on fees the
[52:18] same basic transaction capacity that we
[52:21] had um at this origin and I find that
[52:25] magical and as a technologist myself my
[52:29] my uh respect and admiration for what
[52:32] Satoshi created is um unlimited I just
[52:37] I'm I'm continually Amazed by what he
[52:41] did um but we are going to have to get
[52:45] used to people operating at second and
[52:48] third layers
[52:49] I I think that we shouldn't ostracize
[52:53] people that make the choice of of buying
[52:57] through an ETF
[52:59] or um using micr strategy St stock as a
[53:05] proxy because not only is self- custody
[53:08] still difficult for a lot of people when
[53:10] you start thinking
[53:12] about the future you think about people
[53:15] who are maybe thinking about really
[53:16] long-term planning they have to trade
[53:19] off their ability to maintain these Keys
[53:23] maintain access to the network
[53:26] and um pass this wealth on to Future
[53:32] Generations it frankly probably will be
[53:34] easier for most people to use
[53:37] non-custodial
[53:39] Solutions but I I would still recommend
[53:41] that if if you're in a world where where
[53:45] you can you can take custody now that
[53:49] you at least have some of it in a self-
[53:52] custody solution but probably not all of
[53:54] it yeah it's a it's a good part and it's
[53:57] it's really I was at in Abu Dhabi and I
[54:00] think I brought it up in the last three
[54:02] podcast episodes uh but but I would
[54:05] bring it up anyways um there was a room
[54:08] full of people thousands of people were
[54:10] there and the speaker asked in on the
[54:12] main stage how many of you have tried
[54:15] self- custody not even half the room uh
[54:18] raised the hands so like self custody
[54:21] even I think it's really important uh to
[54:23] use it right now as we have the luxury
[54:26] to to have the Rolls-Royce but it's also
[54:29] something uh that is a luxury and I love
[54:33] your Rolls-Royce example because it uh I
[54:36] I truly think it is something that we we
[54:39] we we we we should enjoy it and we
[54:44] should appreciate that and we know uh it
[54:50] will not be something everyone can do uh
[54:54] once we get to have a Bitcoin s world
[54:56] yeah just the the reality and I think
[54:59] sometimes we have to deal with reality
[55:01] right I I think that
[55:03] that's um I love the dream I I I I I
[55:09] wish somebody could create something
[55:12] that was like that but that's not what
[55:14] we have and I
[55:15] think um the miracle of Bitcoin has been
[55:18] presented to us it's a you know believe
[55:21] whatever you wish spiritually but I I
[55:24] believe it's a divinely inspired
[55:25] technology that that will create a lot
[55:28] of freedom for
[55:30] people um you know
[55:33] the the biblical thing you know money is
[55:35] the root of all evil like that sort of
[55:37] thing well I think this is a this is a
[55:39] chance for you to have money that's much
[55:44] more resistant to evil than anything
[55:48] else and whether whether you believe
[55:50] that spiritually or just you know human
[55:52] nature I think I think it it serves that
[55:55] purpose
[55:58] and uh so instead of complaining about
[56:01] it um embrace it be thankful for what we
[56:06] have I think we're at kind of at that
[56:07] time of year right we're in the holiday
[56:09] season it's a good time for reflection
[56:11] and those sort of things and okayy it's
[56:13] it's a amazing
[56:16] gift embrace it don't fight it um and
[56:22] and but but also I'll say this too
[56:26] don't don't
[56:29] allow these big centralized forces to
[56:32] have all the control at the base layer
[56:34] you know that was part of my messaging
[56:36] going kind of back to the beginning is
[56:38] like these whether it's the nation
[56:41] states big Banks central banks big
[56:45] corporations if you believe the world's
[56:47] going to hyper Bitcoin I they're coming
[56:49] along like like we're not going to stop
[56:52] them
[56:53] from being part of the Bitcoin
[56:56] Revolution and and if if it happens and
[56:59] I believe it will then they will want to
[57:01] be part of it and they'll be want to be
[57:03] a big part of it so we have to preserve
[57:06] as much as we
[57:07] can that's kind of pleb level ethos
[57:11] driven bitcoiners because they probably
[57:15] won't be they they they will be they
[57:18] will look at things
[57:19] differently um but as I I mentioned
[57:22] before I would I really hope we can keep
[57:25] like 30% of the network horses and
[57:29] rabbits
[57:30] plebs ethos driven people they're
[57:33] creating the templates they're helping
[57:36] each other get access to the base layer
[57:39] um
[57:41] uh they're not
[57:43] corruptible they're kind of anonymous
[57:46] like all these sorts of things I think
[57:48] are really
[57:49] important for the Bitcoin as we know it
[57:53] to always exist I think even if if that
[57:56] fails Bitcoin will still exist it'll
[57:58] probably still be massively successful
[58:01] but it'll it'll have a different
[58:03] Spirit the the the spirit of satosi
[58:06] might might have gone at this point then
[58:09] I love that um one more topic before we
[58:13] come to the end routines of the of the
[58:14] podcast um as we as you said we in the
[58:17] holiday season it's now the 17th of
[58:20] December when this comes out it's
[58:21] probably very close to New Year's Eve
[58:24] somewhere between Christmas and New
[58:25] Year's Eve this EP episode will drop uh
[58:27] so how how has this year been uh for
[58:32] Bitcoin there has been so much happening
[58:35] uh what are some of your highlights and
[58:37] how how do you look back at uh 2024 it
[58:40] seems like a long year doesn't it I I
[58:42] think back to uh the beginning of the
[58:46] year and you know where we where we were
[58:49] at that point and you know as a
[58:51] minor uh the very like this time last
[58:54] year it had been a really difficult
[58:58] period for for those of us in in
[59:02] especially in the mining Community um
[59:05] hash rate was too high price was too low
[59:08] like we were not doing well it was a
[59:11] struggle to survive the year started out
[59:14] gloriously though you know when when as
[59:17] we came into the first of the year and
[59:20] we saw the
[59:21] ETFs get announced and the having the
[59:25] reality of having became apparent I
[59:28] think to the general public or kind of
[59:30] to maybe to the mainstream plebs like
[59:32] and so we had I think we had just had
[59:36] that marvelous first part of the Year
[59:38] run it was was really really wonderful
[59:41] we kind of POS having though I think we
[59:44] fell into um almost like a post
[59:48] honeymoon phase like like the the
[59:52] honeymoon was over and I'm not just
[59:54] talking like price-wise I feel like the
[59:56] community kind of lost some of its
[60:00] enthusiasm like cuz we we just had such
[60:02] a great run in that first part of the
[60:04] year and the summer got pretty difficult
[60:06] again like I I wrote a a tweet that that
[60:11] um was somewhat popular about Dante's
[60:15] Hell and and um what had happened was
[60:19] hash rate continued to grow was
[60:22] skyrocketing but the Bitcoin price was
[60:24] falling and there were no feed
[60:27] and we had the H the having had occurred
[60:30] so um I had done this tweet about
[60:33] Dante's Hell about how the price every
[60:35] time it went down another thousand we
[60:37] went down another level of Dante's Hell
[60:40] and that that if if we went much further
[60:44] there would be nothing left but ashes
[60:46] because the the miners were it was it
[60:49] was an extended period like that could
[60:52] have been existential to a lot of the
[60:54] mining Community um
[60:57] and of course you know we had the uh the
[61:00] the German
[61:01] liquidation of Bitcoin suppressing price
[61:04] we had the uh Mount goau FTX stuff you
[61:08] know kind of flooding the market we had
[61:10] kind of a lot of these negative signals
[61:12] I think at that
[61:14] point um especially in the US you know
[61:17] we knew the elections were coming I
[61:19] think there was a lot of
[61:21] concern that the current Administration
[61:26] policies were going to continue that
[61:28] they might win um and you know that that
[61:32] would probably have a global uh
[61:34] impact I think things started to really
[61:37] turn um positively really with the
[61:41] election um that for me what happened in
[61:45] early November with the election of
[61:48] trump and also the Republican control of
[61:52] both houses and I'm not I'm not a
[61:54] republican by the way I'm I'm not a
[61:56] Democrat either but I think that I'm
[61:59] looking at through the Optics of Bitcoin
[62:01] what we found
[62:02] was the political
[62:06] Alliance was was forming and gaining
[62:10] power uh around a a pro
[62:14] Bitcoin um Pro Bitcoin platforms and
[62:17] that I think we really had an influence
[62:19] over the elections and I think now we're
[62:21] starting to see that Ripple into other
[62:23] places we mentioned earlier saw the spe
[62:26] in the European Parliament um this
[62:28] morning from the from one of the the the
[62:31] French members um
[62:33] yesterday again we're recording this on
[62:35] the 17th um the Canadian Finance
[62:38] Minister resigned there's rumors that
[62:40] Trudeau uh will be resigning in Canada
[62:43] there's a lot of these groups that have
[62:44] been very anti- Bitcoin we're sitting on
[62:48] $108,000 Bitcoin
[62:50] today uh I think the mood is very very
[62:54] positive um
[62:57] so I come into the year with a lot of
[63:00] optimism that said I think we always
[63:02] have to be careful that that in the
[63:05] midst of
[63:08] euphoria um which I think we're in the
[63:10] early stages of a Bitcoin Euphoria
[63:14] that's when you can let your guard down
[63:16] that's that's when you can become very
[63:18] exposed right it's it's when if you talk
[63:22] to anybody that's a security expert
[63:24] whether that's a network security or
[63:26] physical security what they'll tell you
[63:28] is it's when you feel
[63:31] comfortable that you're safe that you're
[63:33] the most
[63:35] exposed um so I think that's what we
[63:38] have to be careful of and as a
[63:40] minor it's something that that I think
[63:42] about it's why why I like coming on
[63:44] shows like this and I appreciate the
[63:46] chance to talk to people like you
[63:48] because I think things like these pool
[63:51] centralization hash rate centralization
[63:54] lack of template diversity lack of
[63:56] geographic diversity like these are
[63:59] things that in the midst of
[64:02] euphoria can perpetuate and get
[64:06] worse and then when the
[64:08] next threat comes when the next down
[64:11] turn comes they become very
[64:15] exposed so you know so now now is not
[64:19] the time to stop worrying about these
[64:22] things now is the time maybe to become
[64:25] hypervigilant
[64:26] about making sure that these things
[64:28] don't happen that is
[64:30] super interesting I I I said it's the
[64:33] last question but I I have some some
[64:35] more if you have time
[64:38] um I'm I was always fascinated by the
[64:41] connection between the Bitcoin price and
[64:45] Mining uh and you said in the beginning
[64:48] where we had this low price but hashd
[64:52] has been just hitting one Alum high
[64:54] after another altime High uh and it was
[64:57] fascinating to see sometimes where
[65:00] Bitcoin hash rate hit altime high after
[65:02] altime high but the price was down 50%
[65:06] sometimes I think even 60% from the last
[65:08] alltime High um what is the connection
[65:12] between price and Mining hash rate if
[65:15] there is even one oh uh it's an it's an
[65:20] age-old question does price lead hash or
[65:22] does hash lead price if you if you put a
[65:24] gun to my head you have to pick one I
[65:26] would probably pick hash lead's price
[65:28] but I think I think what we're talking
[65:32] about is actually a problem do you
[65:35] remember there's an issue with the
[65:38] elephants and the especially the public
[65:40] Miners And I think this is the problem
[65:42] let's let let's con let's talk actually
[65:46] we before we get to the elephants let me
[65:47] talk about the way like a horse or a
[65:49] rabbit let's say you decide you want to
[65:51] be a rabbit tomorrow Robin okay so so
[65:53] you're you're going to go order order um
[65:56] a bid ax let's say you make a decision
[66:00] today two days later it's going to
[66:03] arrive and a day after that you're
[66:05] hashing okay so so you made this
[66:07] decision to participate three days later
[66:11] you're hashing okay so in other words
[66:14] the Bitcoin environment that existed at
[66:16] the time you made the economic decision
[66:18] to get into mining is essentially the
[66:22] exact same environment in which you
[66:23] start mining now let's look at the horse
[66:26] like me I want to put up a new 1
[66:28] megawatt facility in
[66:30] Pennsylvania I need let's say a million
[66:32] dollar well I can raise that money
[66:35] pretty quickly so but from the time I
[66:37] decide to start raising the money to the
[66:40] time that I'm
[66:42] hashing let's say it's 12 to 16
[66:46] weeks okay pretty quick really right so
[66:49] again if that happened on January 1st
[66:53] then somewhere around a April 1st I'm
[66:56] mining again the likelihood that I made
[67:00] the economic decision uh is roughly
[67:03] consistent with when the hash comes
[67:06] online okay now I want to do an elephant
[67:10] you and I decide we're going to form a
[67:12] partnership Robin we're going to go
[67:14] we're going to raise big money we're
[67:16] going to put up a 200 megawatt facility
[67:19] it cost $200 million well it's going to
[67:22] take a little while to raise that money
[67:24] to come up with a business plan raise
[67:25] raise the money then we have you know we
[67:27] we find the site we have lots of
[67:30] permitting we have very long lead times
[67:33] for Transformers and hash huts and tens
[67:36] of thousands of mining servers and all
[67:38] that so we come up 15 months later now
[67:42] what are the odds that the economic
[67:45] conditions upon which we started this
[67:48] Venture
[67:50] match with our expectations they're
[67:53] pretty low so when
[67:56] so I took you through that because when
[67:58] you look at hash rate ripping when the
[68:01] hash rate is
[68:03] ripping and it's led by the horses and
[68:06] the
[68:07] rabbits it's a reflection of current
[68:10] economic conditions when it's being led
[68:12] by the elephants it's being led by
[68:15] expectations set one to two years
[68:19] earlier and so that's the
[68:23] problem is that and and what also is
[68:26] really difficult is that predicting
[68:30] where hash rate is going to go is hard
[68:33] so let's just
[68:35] pretend again we were doing this $200
[68:37] million project you and I are Executives
[68:41] in a in a big uh a big public Mining
[68:44] Company well sitting in other boardrooms
[68:47] of other big mining companies are other
[68:50] people who may be making a similar
[68:52] decision but we are unaware of it so we
[68:54] don't really know the future hash rate
[68:58] conditions very
[68:59] well um we didn't talk about it but I
[69:02] came from the personal computer industry
[69:04] that was my background um early early
[69:06] days of the personal computer industry
[69:09] and we face this problem sometimes in
[69:10] the personal computer industry and it
[69:13] would it would work this way I worked
[69:15] for a company called Gateway and at one
[69:16] time we were one of the top five PC
[69:18] companies in the world making like 10
[69:20] million PCS a
[69:22] year
[69:24] so um in an era like
[69:27] 1995 which was um a Heyday in the in the
[69:32] personal computer
[69:34] industry we would sit in a room on an
[69:37] annual basis um and we had we had very
[69:40] sophisticated models right we had a
[69:42] whole team actually that work team
[69:44] worked for me um to try to model what
[69:47] the growth of the P personal computer
[69:49] Market would be and what percentage of
[69:52] that growth would be ours
[69:55] but all of our competitors had the same
[69:58] thing so it it would what would often
[70:01] happen is something like this let's say
[70:04] globally in 1994 100 million PCS had
[70:07] been produced and we had had 10% of
[70:11] it now we look at the overall market and
[70:15] we think it's going to grow from 100
[70:16] million to 120 million and we think
[70:20] instead of 10% of the grow 10% of the
[70:24] the grow growth being ours we're going
[70:27] to pick up market share so we're going
[70:29] to get 20% of
[70:31] it okay so what that means is we go off
[70:34] to our suppliers and we order parts we
[70:37] did 10 million one year now we're going
[70:39] to order 12 million so we you know for
[70:42] hard drives and processors and
[70:44] motherboards and all these things so we
[70:46] order 12 million we get the supplying
[70:48] chain moving for us growing 20% but over
[70:53] at
[70:53] Dell which may had uh 18% market
[70:58] share they do the same thing they think
[71:01] instead of 18% they're going to get 18%
[71:04] of the growth they think they're going
[71:06] to get 30% of the growth so instead of
[71:09] buying 18 million in Parts they buy 23
[71:12] million in parts and they get the supply
[71:15] chain moving well it's very rare if you
[71:18] think about the psychology of people for
[71:22] people to
[71:23] forecast that they're going to
[71:26] shrink right but the reality is every
[71:30] year somebody shrinks in market share
[71:32] and somebody grows in market share so
[71:35] you what what happens is the we we we
[71:38] ran into this problem in the
[71:40] industry everybody would forecast
[71:43] growth and in both in the overall market
[71:47] and in their hash rate or in their um
[71:50] their production
[71:51] rate so so the market would get
[71:56] overproduced in these periods of
[71:58] euphoria it's partly what I was talking
[71:59] about before like these periods of
[72:01] euphoria everybody gets caught up in it
[72:03] and they overdo it like they go
[72:05] overboard and they
[72:08] overgrow um we're just by human nature I
[72:11] think we're optimists but it can be a
[72:15] fault so one reason the hash rate
[72:19] continues to rip is I think people being
[72:23] overly optimistic
[72:27] and that causes problems because I think
[72:30] at periods of time it pushes a large
[72:34] piece of the mining Community
[72:36] into economically disadvantageous
[72:40] positions that would not happen if this
[72:43] OV exuberance hadn't caused that growth
[72:47] so I think we have to be very careful
[72:49] like I think so that's a really
[72:51] long-winded way of saying I think it was
[72:53] a bad thing hash rate should not have
[72:55] grown as much as it grew and it was a
[72:58] bad thing for Bitcoin and it
[73:01] disincentivized some of the more
[73:04] financially responsible companies from
[73:07] growing and the
[73:11] more
[73:12] exuberant uh companies grow grew too
[73:15] fast and often they're the ones that are
[73:18] performing the worst so what you don't
[73:21] want is you don't want over a long
[73:23] period of time the people who are being
[73:26] funded with things like convertible debt
[73:29] and and and at the market stock
[73:31] offerings but losing
[73:34] money to take over and be the only ones
[73:37] mining we then we have no operational
[73:39] excellence in the market um and they're
[73:42] and they're highly subject to being
[73:45] captured so um I I probably answered way
[73:48] more than you wanted but but hopefully
[73:51] that helped I I I like that I you really
[73:54] G give full context to it uh to to the
[73:57] to the question so I like that uh but we
[74:01] we already very Progressive to time um
[74:05] but I think that's a great episode to to
[74:09] see where mining currently is uh and to
[74:13] see potential problems that arise and I
[74:15] think as you said it especially in those
[74:18] moments where there's a lot of euphoria
[74:20] a lot of
[74:21] excitement like USA will buy Bitcoin Eur
[74:25] will buy Bitcoin everything is going to
[74:26] have a Bitcoin isation tomorrow uh we we
[74:30] have to be aware of the fundamentals
[74:32] that's why I made today also an episode
[74:35] uh where I talked about self- custody uh
[74:37] why it's important what we should do
[74:39] with Utes o management uh and those
[74:41] episodes are really important to um
[74:45] stick to the basics and uh Al also no
[74:49] not just fly to the moon so there are
[74:52] really important episodes and I'm so
[74:54] glad you did it uh with me thank you so
[74:56] much thank you Robin perfect then we
[74:59] have an tin in the podcast with two
[75:02] questions the one question is always the
[75:03] same question for each guest uh and the
[75:06] question is what can we learn from you
[75:08] besides Bitcoin well um I think
[75:12] being I call it the 10th man you could
[75:14] think of it as a a devil's advocate is
[75:17] very important um and and it leads to
[75:20] this point we were just on like when the
[75:23] whole world is going one way
[75:26] make sure you step back and say is there
[75:30] a flaw in that can I can I
[75:33] find can I find a flaw maybe there isn't
[75:36] it's okay but make sure you've really
[75:38] stepped back I call it the 10th Man
[75:40] Theory it's something I stole from a
[75:41] movie called World War Z
[75:44] where um I won't tell the whole story um
[75:47] but
[75:48] but it's basically like hey when when
[75:52] everybody seems to be agreeing and
[75:53] thinking the same thing thing it's
[75:56] probably a good time to sit back and
[75:58] think about it and and I think it's in
[76:00] these periods of exuberance that it's
[76:03] very easy to just get caught up in that
[76:04] flow and so um so yeah be be critical
[76:10] think think outside the box think
[76:12] differently um and you might you might
[76:14] find opportunity in that by the way that
[76:17] that's you know I've spent my life as a
[76:19] technologist and I think try to think
[76:21] differently to look at um to to look at
[76:25] a
[76:26] problem in a new in a new way and you'll
[76:30] be shocked at at what you can create by
[76:35] doing that great I love that a lot uh I
[76:38] don't know where the 10th man comes from
[76:40] I think you have to do research that I I
[76:42] only know the the 12th man from from
[76:45] soccer that's the audience that's where
[76:47] my mind went well I can I can tell real
[76:49] I'll tell you there's anep I have a a
[76:51] show I call old manels people that want
[76:53] to go I I I have
[76:55] an episode all on this but the short
[76:57] version is in the movie World War Z
[76:59] which is a zombie movie right it's not
[77:01] some deep movie it's a it's a
[77:03] entertaining movie but there's a point
[77:06] where um uh the world is now being
[77:10] overrun by zombies except for in Israel
[77:14] and
[77:15] so um Brad Pit who plays a character in
[77:18] that movie flies to Israel and asks the
[77:22] head of security there like how how come
[77:25] you guys haven't been overrun what did
[77:27] you do and he said it's because of the
[77:30] 10th Man and and he explains that uh
[77:36] in uh Israeli history in in 1972 at the
[77:42] Munich Olympics that there had been a
[77:46] threat against the Israeli
[77:48] athletes um from a terrorist group and
[77:51] it had been
[77:52] ignored because it was it was not
[77:54] considered a viable threat well it ended
[77:57] up being real and they were overrun and
[77:59] then he goes through these other cases
[78:01] in Israeli history where they had had
[78:05] evidence signs that a bad thing was
[78:07] going to happen but the security Council
[78:11] had always unanimously agreed and their
[78:14] security Council has 10 people so they
[78:17] created a rule that
[78:20] says if presented with a
[78:23] threat if the first nine members of
[78:26] Security Council all agree it is not
[78:29] something to worry about it is
[78:31] imperative on the 10th
[78:34] Man to take the negative position and
[78:38] argue a case as to why they are wrong so
[78:41] I advocate for people to always be the
[78:43] 10th Man in Bitcoin and um you don't
[78:47] have to be but what you have to do if
[78:49] you're going to be the 10th man I call
[78:50] it like Devil's Advocate on steroids
[78:53] like you can't just
[78:56] you have to like take it like super
[78:58] seriously it's like if anybody that was
[79:00] did debate as a maybe when they were
[79:03] younger um you know the way they do a
[79:05] debate often is they they pick a topic
[79:07] and they tell you whether or not you
[79:10] have to debate the pro or the con of the
[79:12] topic right so you don't win the debate
[79:16] if if if you don't attack even if you
[79:19] personally disagree with the position
[79:22] you lose the debate if you don't attack
[79:24] it with Vigor so the 10th man has to
[79:26] take that
[79:27] attitude um in in in
[79:32] uh examining that
[79:35] position I love that I was in uh when I
[79:38] was like 15 16 17 years old I was in uh
[79:42] getting into politics now I'm not in
[79:44] politics at all and we made those
[79:46] evenings uh where we put out one topic
[79:51] and the topic was known before and then
[79:54] you came to the evening and this was
[79:56] like 10 20 people and then you randomly
[79:58] was designed a side of the topic and you
[80:02] didn't knew before the evening if you
[80:03] will argue for it or against it and this
[80:07] was amazing uh the the experience of
[80:11] arguing against your own opinion uh is
[80:15] something where you really get to know a
[80:17] topic uh and just like arguing against
[80:20] Bitcoin uh will that's actually how I I
[80:24] I Des red in the beginning ones uh
[80:26] that's actually how I got into Bitcoin
[80:28] because uh I was skeptical of Bitcoin
[80:31] and people were Bing me about Bitcoin in
[80:33] 2020 because I was in I was in investing
[80:36] and and people are like oh you invest in
[80:38] stuff like why not Bitcoin also I was
[80:41] like a Bitcoin is a scam that was my
[80:43] basic Assumption of it and I kind of
[80:46] acknowledged that I ran out of arguments
[80:48] against Bitcoin so I wanted to find more
[80:52] arguments against Bitcoin on a weekend
[80:55] uh and Friday I went in trying to search
[80:57] arguments against Bitcoin Sunday I came
[80:59] out and say like ah that Bitcoin thing
[81:01] might be
[81:03] something so with finding arguments uh
[81:06] against or for something you actually
[81:08] can discover something new and I like
[81:10] that a lot really cool yeah absolutely
[81:12] and you can apply to anything like
[81:14] should I own mining stocks or not should
[81:17] uh we be worried about how many pools
[81:20] there are um should we should nation
[81:23] states control block templates pick
[81:25] whatever topic you want but but um yeah
[81:29] absolutely yeah really cool perfect then
[81:32] we have another end routine where uh the
[81:34] previous guest is asking a question for
[81:36] the next guest uh without knowing who
[81:38] the next guest is uh and the question
[81:41] for you is what is the best analogy to
[81:45] explain Bitcoin you ever heard okay your
[81:48] uh your previous guest is evil but okay
[81:52] um it's hard to pick one right it's it's
[81:54] it's like that I'm trying I'm trying to
[81:57] not uh just cuz you know I leap to
[82:01] digital gold and like those sort of
[82:03] things but that's just kind of lame so
[82:04] let me see if I can come up with
[82:06] something a little a little better well
[82:09] okay I I'll say this I I came from the
[82:12] personal computer World okay and I think
[82:16] the personal computer
[82:19] was a way in
[82:21] which computing power
[82:25] moved from centralized forces to the
[82:30] individual and it was a marvelous thing
[82:33] I built the whole early part of my
[82:35] career on that and it might sound
[82:38] trivial to younger people or people who
[82:41] weren't aware of that but I'm old enough
[82:44] that in the 60s and 7s when I grew up a
[82:49] computer was not something that you
[82:53] owned and access to a
[82:55] computer was a privilege it was
[82:58] permissioned you only got access to
[83:01] computing power by being in a very
[83:03] privileged fortunate position when
[83:07] others um a big company or a university
[83:12] or a government gave you that
[83:16] access and and uh look how the world
[83:21] changed when we moved computing power to
[83:24] the
[83:25] individual and and and Bitcoin is the
[83:28] same thing bit Bitcoin is
[83:30] moving Financial sovereignty and you
[83:34] know uh Financial Freedom to the
[83:37] individual and um I don't know all the
[83:40] things that are going to happen just
[83:41] like I you know I I didn't know all the
[83:44] implications of the personal computer I
[83:46] think you could actually even argue that
[83:48] Bitcoin doesn't happen without the
[83:50] personal computer one of the side
[83:53] effects of
[83:55] the creation and decentralization of
[83:58] computing power was
[84:00] Bitcoin um in fact I haven't thought
[84:02] about this a lot before but I would say
[84:05] yes that's actually 100% true that
[84:07] Bitcoin does not happen without the
[84:09] personal computer it was you know part
[84:11] of the DNA of Bitcoin goes back so um
[84:16] that's that's probably the best I can do
[84:17] on on uh
[84:20] impromptu uh with an impromptu question
[84:23] but really good one really good question
[84:26] I like this it's it's interesting the
[84:28] best best questions come from the guest
[84:30] actually not from the host oh yours were
[84:33] great yours were great too uh perfect
[84:35] and thank you so much uh Bob for being
[84:37] on before I let you go where can people
[84:38] find you ask your questions reach out to
[84:40] you I'm I'm active on uh X or Twitter as
[84:44] Boomer
[84:46] BTC um you can find me on YouTube I have
[84:49] a show called Old manel's there um I do
[84:53] a show about once a month that's really
[84:54] just a monologue of of me so if you
[84:57] didn't get enough of me blabbering on
[84:59] here there's more there uh and my
[85:01] company Barefoot mining you can find at
[85:03] bareo mining.com I love that really cool
[85:06] thank you so much I just realized uh Jen
[85:08] C is talking to pomas i l the L the
[85:12] syner yeah thank you so much then thank
[85:15] you so much Bob for being on thank you
[85:16] so much also for everyone that is
[85:18] watching and listening for joining us
[85:19] today as always I'll be back tomorrow uh
[85:22] with another episode bye-bye
