[00:00] fix the money fix the world Bitcoin
[00:01] fixes everything I don't think so money
[00:04] that cannot be confiscated or stopped
[00:06] that's just part of the puzzle then what
[00:08] what as human can you do to be as free
[00:10] as possible we are all born free
[00:13] different entities start to restrict our
[00:15] freedoms Bitcoin is just money Bitcoin
[00:18] is a network Information Network just
[00:20] like email and it will become boring
[00:22] everybody will be using it everybody
[00:24] will be used to it a book like this like
[00:26] a paper book it's a platform of its own
[00:29] so you only need this you don't need any
[00:31] additional infrastructure maybe a candle
[00:32] light or sunlight to me masculinity is
[00:36] the urge the need to protect others to
[00:39] provide for others like Psychopaths and
[00:42] and are psychopaths and
[00:44]  and we should call them as
[00:46] such Bitcoin is just money Bitcoin is
[00:49] just money everyone uses money
[00:51] bitcoiners are not special Bitcoin is
[00:55] not virtuous the internet is not
[00:57] virtuous you go to have them on the back
[00:59] of your own actions you Damn
[01:02] Few um regarding this post and it's
[01:05] obviously from from you um when did you
[01:08] first discover Bitcoin why are you now
[01:11] publishing books about Bitcoin and what
[01:13] is bitcoin for you now right so it's a
[01:15] little bit of long story as it often is
[01:19] I discovered Bitcoin as early as
[01:21] 2010 purely from uh Tech perspective I
[01:25] didn't know anything about the money or
[01:27] or anything like that just like to play
[01:29] around with all kinds of different
[01:31] software I didn't really understand what
[01:33] it was and uh kept doing that for years
[01:37] every now and then it will pop up
[01:40] somewhere some in news you know it's
[01:42] going up or whatever but I didn't really
[01:44] pay attention to it
[01:46] until I think uh 2016 2017 started
[01:50] taking a little bit more more interest
[01:53] had started my own company so I got more
[01:55] interested in money and
[01:57] business and 2017 I read the Bitcoin
[02:00] white paper and then I realized it's um
[02:03] it's a protocol that has the possibility
[02:05] to solve all the major economic issues
[02:08] in the world so that blew me away and
[02:11] and I just decided
[02:14] that uh I need to help other people
[02:16] understand it because I was suffering
[02:19] from it for such a long time without
[02:21] understanding it and I don't consider
[02:23] myself especially a stupid guy but I
[02:26] still didn't get it even though it was
[02:28] like right there
[02:30] so there's um I think there's a lot to
[02:32] be done to explain Bitcoin correctly and
[02:36] not only technical side like I don't
[02:38] consider myself technical but uh the
[02:40] most important side is the possible
[02:45] socioeconomic um implications for
[02:48] humankind that have really a chance to
[02:50] take us to the next level so that's
[02:52] that's kind of like I want to work for
[02:55] the future generations and not just you
[02:58] know try to pump as much value from from
[03:01] this lifetime that I have left but
[03:02] rather build something that is lasting
[03:05] for the whole whole Humanity for my
[03:07] children and their children's children
[03:09] so that's why I've committed
[03:11] to um publishing books about the Bitcoin
[03:15] and not only Bitcoin of course Bitcoin
[03:17] is just a very powerful tool of
[03:19] Liberation but in about Liberty in
[03:21] general about being free and it's about
[03:24] uh your mindset you know uh try to leave
[03:27] the Fiat slavery mindset and come free
[03:30] like you don't really need Bitcoin for
[03:32] that like I became a digital Nomad
[03:35] before way before I became a bitcoiner
[03:39] so I guess my mission is to liberate as
[03:42] many people as possible from the trap of
[03:45] uh the prison of their own
[03:47] mind yeah I also saw that you one of the
[03:51] fewer bitcoiners or Freedom maximalist
[03:53] that don't have Bitcoin in the in the
[03:56] bio directly but it's obviously from the
[03:59] the the profile of of your Twitter and
[04:01] from your online profile that Bitcoin is
[04:03] a big part of your life but uh still you
[04:06] keep it out out of your bio you keep it
[04:09] out it's like not a Bitcoin publishing
[04:11] house it's consensus Network um is that
[04:14] all intentionally It's like because
[04:16] freedom is uh the the thing that goes
[04:20] above
[04:22] Bitcoin I think it's um it's a vector
[04:25] it's it's kind of like a path that that
[04:27] you're you put yourself on first I was
[04:30] really obsessed with Bitcoin in every
[04:32] way I used to think like many still
[04:35] think that you know fix fix the money
[04:37] fix the world you know Bitcoin fixes
[04:39] everything Bitcoin fixes this and that I
[04:41] don't think so strongly now like Bitcoin
[04:44] is just money that's what the Tweet is
[04:46] about it's it's just money and it's kind
[04:49] of boring really like nobody really
[04:52] everybody uses it it's like air um it's
[04:55] it's necessary but it's not really like
[04:58] your goal in life should not be
[04:59] breathing air I guess I mean you might
[05:02] as well not exist so if your goal is
[05:05] just to gather maximum amount of money
[05:08] so what like what's what's the good what
[05:10] what are you doing with that money how
[05:11] do you wield that power that stored
[05:14] energy that Bitcoin as as the
[05:17] quintessential hard money can enable so
[05:22] that's just you know part of the puzzle
[05:24] to be able to have store your energy in
[05:27] a resource in a money that cannot
[05:29] confiscated or stopped that's just part
[05:31] of the puzzle then what what what are
[05:33] you going to do with that and that's the
[05:35] part that I'm interested in and what's
[05:37] what's then like if if if you have okay
[05:40] you have a life you want uh to be a
[05:43] maximal freedom human and you figured
[05:46] out the money part you're like okay
[05:48] Bitcoin is my saving savings technology
[05:50] it's my money device um what's as a
[05:54] human can you do to be as free as
[05:57] possible and what does this mean to be
[05:59] free
[06:01] free well I would say that um to be free
[06:05] like we are all Born Free technically
[06:08] but then of course our freedom start to
[06:11] uh different entities start to restrict
[06:14] our freedoms from birth of course our
[06:17] parents are are obviously one but U you
[06:19] know maybe that's a little bit different
[06:20] they try to keep us safe for the most
[06:22] part but then we have another kind of
[06:24] entity the government which is sort of
[06:27] always going to be trying to parent us
[06:31] into doing the correct thing and they
[06:33] would
[06:34] set they will use kind of like a central
[06:38] power element to set what is the truth
[06:41] what is the correct way to
[06:43] behave and instead of market so so I
[06:46] guess free
[06:48] market and and free trade between
[06:50] individuals that's true freedom and
[06:53] without any stealing without any cour
[06:55] that's uh the kind of Freedom maximalism
[06:57] that I'm talking about you have freedom
[06:59] of speech you have freedom freedom of
[07:01] action but of course you have to
[07:03] remember every action has a consequence
[07:05] so if if your action is to initiate
[07:08] violence then usually that violence is
[07:10] met with violence so that's why
[07:12] non-aggression principle is so important
[07:14] for such an important part of being a a
[07:18] free human being so you can't really be
[07:21] free and then you know expect people to
[07:25] do uh what you want or use violence to
[07:28] make people do what you want so you
[07:30] should use market for that so providing
[07:32] better and better services so that
[07:34] people will give their money to you
[07:37] voluntarily that's the highest
[07:38] complement in the in the free
[07:40] entrepreneurial
[07:42] Market is giving money voluntarily do
[07:45] you mean with that uh value for Value
[07:48] principle uh and the the sphere for
[07:52] Content creation content creators it's
[07:54] quite popular also and do we still need
[07:58] a referee like I don't know how you can
[08:01] how you would call it like state or like
[08:03] government but it's kind of a a referee
[08:05] if someone uh exposes violence against
[08:09] someone else with with no reason or with
[08:12] a bad reason maybe like whoever says is
[08:15] a bad reason but it's like violence um
[08:17] do we need a referee still if uh in in
[08:21] in in a Ideal
[08:25] World I think so yeah I mean whenever
[08:28] there's a human human beings they're
[08:30] trading there's going there's bound to
[08:32] be a dispute at some point for sure and
[08:35] that's uh that's the maybe the biggest
[08:38] unsolvable problem that humankind has
[08:40] always had and I I don't know if it is
[08:43] solvable in the end like arbitration
[08:46] between two trading parties like
[08:48] everything is a trade everything you
[08:51] know like I I decide to use a part of my
[08:54] day to come to this podcast that's a
[08:56] trade because I get something from this
[08:58] and and the trade does not happen unless
[09:02] both of us think that there we are
[09:05] getting more than we are giving so
[09:08] that's That's the basis of the
[09:10] trade um there there's uh two concepts
[09:13] from Austrian economics that are called
[09:15] um uh exante and
[09:19] expost um referring to the trade so
[09:23] exante is before the trade you have a
[09:25] certain expectation of of return from
[09:29] the trade and then expost is after you
[09:33] done the trade you have data was it a
[09:35] successful trade am I happy with it then
[09:39] at that Mo moment your opinion might
[09:41] change okay this was not a good trade I
[09:43] wish I didn't do it but exante I I had a
[09:47] higher expectation for the trade so even
[09:51] if later you regret your trade at that
[09:53] moment when you made it your your value
[09:56] expectation was positive so Expo
[09:59] situation you're not happy your product
[10:02] uh doesn't match the your expectations
[10:06] or it was uh described poorly so what do
[10:09] you do then of course you can contact
[10:11] your trade partner and try to resolve it
[10:13] that way oneon-one that's the first step
[10:17] uh but unfortunately that doesn't always
[10:18] work especially with internet trade
[10:21] there a lot of lot of scammers so how do
[10:23] you arbitrate that and we have the
[10:27] courthouse in in the the modern world
[10:30] now but I think with the with the
[10:33] software that kind of solution could be
[10:36] possibly um solved with with some kind
[10:40] of a decentralized network solution
[10:42] which is something that I'm really
[10:43] interested exist yet uh from Austrian
[10:47] perspective it's uh usually private cour
[10:50] houses so the same thing as every other
[10:52] government Service uh free market would
[10:55] provide this service so there will be
[10:57] this trusted courthous say that um trade
[11:01] Partners can then hire to arbitrate the
[11:03] issues but again there's an issue of
[11:06] what if the other trade partner does not
[11:08] recognize this court that I want to use
[11:11] and then uh you know how do you arrive
[11:13] to without coercion without using
[11:16] violence how do you make both trading
[11:18] partners use the same arbitration system
[11:21] and that is um a difficult problem to
[11:23] solve and it it's currently being solved
[11:26] by violence so State Police will will
[11:29] uh impose the the justice system on on
[11:33] two parties that don't agree on a
[11:36] trade that's that's it's an interesting
[11:38] idea having private cour houses that are
[11:41] more locally involved but if then
[11:44] there's one party that says look I don't
[11:47] I don't want this Courthouse because I
[11:49] know I don't know you have a
[11:51] relationship with with one of the high
[11:53] UPS there you you can expose something I
[11:56] mean I guess it's the same with uh the
[11:58] currency system because uh if if two are
[12:02] standing and the judg has some thing
[12:04] like there are a lot of uh pitfalls in
[12:08] in even the system now and it's exposed
[12:10] with violence um coming back to
[12:13] consensus Network you started the idea
[12:16] like you started the company with a
[12:19] really really simple idea translating
[12:22] the Bitcoin standard in Finnish I think
[12:25] it was um what's the founding story all
[12:28] about out and and how did you go and uh
[12:31] build this bigger uh company with I
[12:35] think now 11 uh languages
[12:39] supported yeah so I read the Bitcoin
[12:43] standard in 2018 a little bit after it
[12:45] came out I think it was
[12:48] October and um it really spoke to me
[12:51] because it kind of outli all the issues
[12:55] that I thought that are there but I just
[12:57] couldn't really uh point a finger at it
[12:59] or put a name on it and it told me a lot
[13:02] about money and Austrian economics
[13:04] that's how I fell down the Austrian
[13:06] economics Rabbit Hole originally after
[13:08] reading Bitcoin standard cedan has great
[13:11] resources for that book so if you just
[13:13] go through the list of books that he use
[13:15] as references that's a great start to
[13:18] understanding uh you know economics and
[13:21] humankind in in general um so it was a
[13:25] really um mind-blowing experience
[13:27] reading that book
[13:29] so I just wanted to wanted my dad to be
[13:32] able to read it as well and he doesn't
[13:34] read English so immediately after I read
[13:37] the book I I contacted codan if I can
[13:40] translate it and that's how I kind I I
[13:43] found out that I need to buy the license
[13:45] and so on and and I have to start a
[13:47] company and that's why I I started
[13:50] consensus Network in
[13:51] January uh
[13:53] 2019 just to be able to translate that
[13:57] book and yeah I had no high expectation
[14:00] that it's going to do well or anything
[14:02] but then it was quite a popular in
[14:07] Finland so then I figured you can
[14:10] probably do it elsewhere so I just
[14:12] started replicating the kind of like the
[14:15] concept how we did it for the Finnish
[14:18] Market in other markets and it grew
[14:21] organically from there and you have now
[14:24] also owned
[14:25] books that you self uh writing uh the
[14:30] last one I saw is 21 Futures is this uh
[14:33] the is the is this the first uh
[14:37] book yeah this is the first one that is
[14:40] completely our own production like um
[14:44] we've launched kunun vanan homes books
[14:47] uh like praxiology and the very first
[14:50] original English work was the everything
[14:52] divided by 21 million so those were like
[14:56] our production in a in a way uh um but
[14:59] of course they're they're cot's books so
[15:01] we just his publisher 21 Futures is the
[15:04] first one that we we kind of created uh
[15:08] together with um with the lead editor
[15:11] Philip Charter was his idea so we we
[15:14] created from the market these uh 21
[15:18] authors with 21 stories we got over 50
[15:21] submissions and and then we curated um
[15:24] 21 stories into the book so in that
[15:27] sense it is our first like unique
[15:31] production but what is the stories about
[15:33] what are the the offers in it so there's
[15:37] U there's a couple of authors that you
[15:39] you probably know C Swan home is one uh
[15:41] yni appleberg is
[15:43] one
[15:44] um uh there's the the Bitcoin dog who
[15:47] let the Bitcoin dogs out that's a funny
[15:49] one uh so the I think the variety of the
[15:52] stories is is quite strong so you can
[15:56] just pick it up and read the stories in
[15:58] any order and you will be treated to
[16:01] like you know Thrillers and and know
[16:04] Mysteries dystopias horror comedy you
[16:09] know drama all all that kind of things
[16:13] um and the reason why I think this is an
[16:15] interesting and a good product is that
[16:18] Bitcoin is kind of like in the
[16:19] background and libertarian ideals it's
[16:22] not like we're not pushing them and
[16:24] that's that's by Design that's that's on
[16:26] purpose so the the main focus is on on
[16:30] the stories and the human interest and
[16:33] the character development and the world
[16:35] development just interesting stories and
[16:37] this I believe is the way to introduce
[16:41] these ideas these complex ideas to a
[16:44] wider audience by you know just telling
[16:48] better stories and not necessarily
[16:50] pushing any kind of an agenda like some
[16:52] of the stories things have gone really
[16:54] badly because of because of Bitcoin like
[16:57] it's not just that you know Bitcoin
[16:58] fixes everything we in the book we
[17:01] explore all kinds of different
[17:03] possibilities what may happen um in in a
[17:06] future that is colored by by this kind
[17:09] of Bitcoin um idea so a little bit like
[17:12] from Jeff poof the price of tomorrow
[17:14] where Bitcoin is I think mentioned once
[17:18] or twice in the whole book where the the
[17:21] whole concept is like telling a story or
[17:23] telling a problem or telling something
[17:25] and Bitcoin is just in the background it
[17:27] also goes back to what you said in the
[17:29] beginning that Bitcoin is basically just
[17:32] money and now I'm really into Bitcoin um
[17:35] I started my journey in in 2020 and uh
[17:39] but I already know that there will be a
[17:42] time where Bitcoin is quite boring
[17:44] because it's just adopted it's just
[17:46] money it's just uh in our ways um do you
[17:50] how do you see the Bitcoin story
[17:52] evolving like where do you where are we
[17:54] right now uh which phase are we in um
[17:58] how long will be Bitcoin so interesting
[18:01] that everybody talks about it kind of in
[18:04] the sphere and there are Bitcoin only
[18:05] podcasts coming out there are books
[18:07] about it um and this is there like is
[18:10] there like in 100 years time there is
[18:12] all this Bitcoin books and all this
[18:14] Bitcoin education but it's like nobody's
[18:16] interested anymore because it's just
[18:19] money I think we're already kind of ped
[18:22] that like from publisher perspective
[18:25] there's there's a a lot of people who
[18:27] want to publish Bitcoin books still
[18:30] right now but I think the the time has
[18:33] sort of passed on that already like I
[18:35] don't know if you remember a movie
[18:36] called you got mail which was made
[18:39] somewhere in the 90s it's a movie about
[18:41] email essentially now imagine somebody
[18:44] making a story about email like how
[18:46] boring is that like that's that's not
[18:48] really something that you would like to
[18:50] see so I think the same thing is going
[18:52] to happen like now we have we don't
[18:53] really even call it as Bitcoin fiction
[18:56] like I and the same reason why I don't
[18:58] Market consensus Network as a Bitcoin
[19:00] publishing house anymore it's Freedom
[19:02] Publishing House Freedom is a Evergreen
[19:05] uh never dying undying idea Bitcoin is
[19:08] not Bitcoin is just money Bitcoin is a
[19:11] network in Information Network just like
[19:14] email and it will become boring
[19:16] everybody will be using it everybody
[19:18] will be used to it and there is no need
[19:21] to write specific stories about Bitcoin
[19:24] Bitcoin will just be integrated just
[19:26] like anything else just like an internet
[19:29] is inter integrated right now into most
[19:32] of the stories it's just something that
[19:34] people use or smartphones you know
[19:36] there's no need to make smartphone
[19:38] fiction specifically it's just tool that
[19:40] people like to use they don't know how
[19:43] how it works or what the protocol is
[19:45] underlying protocol is and I think same
[19:47] thing is happening to bitcoin and of
[19:49] course for us bitcoiners is difficult to
[19:51] see because we live and breathe Bitcoin
[19:53] all the time we're interested in all the
[19:54] news all the developments we think it
[19:57] matters is the most important thing and
[20:00] it is an important thing but still Human
[20:02] Action is what dictates
[20:05] everything and uh in that way I think it
[20:08] is correct to say that Bitcoin has sort
[20:10] sort of already won uh the monetary in
[20:14] uh monetary Network War if there ever
[20:16] was was one I mean the competition is
[20:19] really only the Fiat Network there's no
[20:21] other competition so in that sense seems
[20:24] like it has one just just on the as
[20:28] assumption that you can keep using it uh
[20:31] voluntarily and nobody can force you to
[20:34] use it or nobody can force you not to
[20:35] use it uh that's that's very important
[20:38] if if that is taken away then then
[20:40] Bitcoin sort of has no value the value
[20:42] proposition comes from
[20:45] avoiding avoiding the uh coercive
[20:49] monetary
[20:50] system so it doesn't even matter so much
[20:53] if it's going to be like hyperb Bitcoin
[20:56] iation and everybody's going to be using
[20:57] it in fact I don't really believe most
[21:00] people will ever be using Bitcoin as we
[21:02] are using Bitcoin today uh you know
[21:05] maybe they're going to be using some
[21:06] layer two layer three layer 10 systems
[21:10] that are somehow tied to the Bitcoin
[21:13] blockchain and I don't think people care
[21:16] like I don't think people people don't
[21:18] care that they're using Linux when they
[21:20] use their uh smartphone operating system
[21:22] they don't they don't care they just
[21:23] want it to work same thing will be with
[21:26] money it will just be an app essentially
[21:29] applica application layer that they can
[21:32] use to get what they want and if it's
[21:35] Diamond points or if it's Bitcoin or
[21:37] SATs that doesn't really matter it will
[21:39] just be a protocol just the same way as
[21:41] using internet they don't really care if
[21:44] it's tcpip protocol or whatever is
[21:46] working underneath but it still be
[21:48] interesting for enthusiasts like us so
[21:51] there will be a place for for Bitcoin
[21:53] books for sure but it will be something
[21:56] similar to computer science books or or
[21:59] books on Austrian economics they will
[22:01] never be mainstream yeah I also think so
[22:03] like like how many people right now
[22:06] really understanding Bitcoin like how
[22:08] many people have really a hardware
[22:09] wallet uh doing the signing themselves
[22:11] doing running them a note themselves
[22:14] like I think there's not a lot of people
[22:16] uh that actually understand it's
[22:18] actually put like 200 400,000 2,000
[22:22] hours of learning into it and then
[22:24] there's also the number that hold
[22:26] Bitcoin this is way ler I know even in
[22:29] my friend Circle I have like at least 10
[22:32] 15 friends I know they have over 50% of
[22:35] the netw worth only in Bitcoin and
[22:38] they're really bullish on it um but if
[22:40] you ask them 10 Bitcoin questions on the
[22:44] second or third level they are blanking
[22:46] out because they did not uh do the um
[22:50] research that deeply so I completely
[22:53] agree that most people will not care
[22:57] about bit coin
[22:58] ever uh but they will use it without
[23:01] even knowing it on a layer two layer
[23:03] three layer four like layer 10 layer 10
[23:06] would be interesting a lot of building
[23:09] has to be be done du then um so I I have
[23:14] one interesting question also the first
[23:15] time Michael sailor came out and and
[23:17] spoke about um his Investments was with
[23:20] the mobile wave like he talked about the
[23:23] mobile wave how Amazon uh like apple
[23:27] Amazon on all those big uh players will
[23:31] dominate the next 10 years and he
[23:33] published a book about it and when he
[23:36] came into Bitcoin he chose to not
[23:38] publish a book about it he also I think
[23:40] he spoke on a podcast about uh this this
[23:44] idea that he is like it takes a long
[23:46] time to write a book and he decided to
[23:48] not do it instead he went on a tour of
[23:52] podcasts I think was a time in 2020 and
[23:56] beginning 2021 where you cannot find any
[23:58] Bitcoin podcast where Milla was not on
[24:02] and how do you how do you see the future
[24:05] of educating the next Generations uh
[24:08] there are more and more podcasts coming
[24:09] out more and more short videos more more
[24:13] engaging content and it seems like books
[24:17] and and and uh this low time preference
[24:21] uh vehicles are more unpopular
[24:25] especially outside of the Bitcoin world
[24:28] I think in the Bitcoin world it's still
[24:29] really popular to read books to dive
[24:31] deep into things um with a podcast you
[24:34] can also dive really deep into things
[24:36] but how do you see this progressing this
[24:39] uh teaching the new generation teaching
[24:42] the next Generations and getting
[24:45] information is
[24:48] documented I think I think the books are
[24:51] definitely less and less popular I would
[24:54] say that they they are never going to I
[24:56] don't I don't say that they're ever
[24:58] going to go away I don't think because
[25:01] well for one a book like this like a
[25:03] paper book it's a platform of its own so
[25:06] you only need this you don't need any
[25:08] additional infrastructure maybe a candle
[25:10] light or sunlight and you can you can
[25:13] read the information you don't need
[25:14] electricity for example so I think
[25:17] that's an unbeatable medium for storing
[25:21] informational
[25:22] value that being said of course with the
[25:26] smartphone and and the high bandwidth
[25:29] internet and subscription services and
[25:31] the convenience of audiobooks podcasts
[25:34] and T Tik Tok which is I find kind of
[25:37] unfortunate what it's what it's doing to
[25:39] our time preference and our attention
[25:41] span it is what it is and and I think we
[25:44] also need to lean into it as Educators
[25:47] and meet people where they are if if
[25:49] people want to watch one minute Tik Tok
[25:51] videos and we want people to be educated
[25:54] well I guess we're making one minute Tik
[25:56] Tok videos it does does like if we make
[25:59] two hour podcast they're still not going
[26:00] to watch it even if we chop it to like 2
[26:03] minute bits they're still too long so I
[26:07] mean we we can the the approach that
[26:09] I've taken is that I I'll build the
[26:11] library either way like I believe that
[26:13] the anyel begins with a library because
[26:16] you have the
[26:17] core uh sort of like U informational
[26:20] storage
[26:21] node that you can then use to propagate
[26:25] in the uh me space
[26:28] let's say that you know all the
[26:30] electricity goes down or the internet is
[26:32] is unusable for some reason which can
[26:34] happen at least locally so then you
[26:37] would still have the the library you you
[26:39] would still have means to educate people
[26:42] and I think that is immensely important
[26:44] especially in the Citadel when you when
[26:46] you're going to have kids you're you're
[26:47] going to bring the new generation how
[26:48] you're going to teach them uh you're not
[26:50] going to be able to remember everything
[26:52] so you're going to need a library one
[26:53] way or another and hard drives are not
[26:56] the best way to store information so I
[26:58] think paperbooks paperbooks are great
[27:01] plus there's a tangible element we are
[27:03] still physical human beings we are not
[27:06] ethereal um so just simply touching
[27:09] something and you know even the smell of
[27:12] the ink and the paper it's a different
[27:14] experience and I I would argue that um
[27:19] it will affect your learning experience
[27:21] as well whether you read it from the
[27:22] screen or you read it from the paper or
[27:25] you listen to it those are all different
[27:27] products and they're all complimentary
[27:29] and not
[27:31] exclusive but yeah to answer the
[27:33] question yes I do believe that the books
[27:35] are less and less popular they're not
[27:37] ever going to go fully away and uh we we
[27:40] just need to meet people where they are
[27:43] and adjust according to the preferences
[27:46] of the market as as entrepreneurs always
[27:49] do yeah I also decided because of that
[27:52] to like I just started out with the
[27:55] podcast but I also uh
[27:58] do because of that short clips of the
[28:02] podcast and they sometimes go really
[28:04] really good way better than the long
[28:07] format but the interesting part um time
[28:11] is additionally like when you calculate
[28:14] everything together time is more spent
[28:16] in the long part long format than in the
[28:18] short formats all together of course the
[28:20] short format is like I put from one
[28:23] podcast I put maybe five to 10 maximum
[28:26] 15 shorts out um so if you have 15 times
[28:31] I don't know 30 seconds uh you need a
[28:33] lot of people to uh compete with uh even
[28:37] 100 only 100 people listening to the
[28:40] whole whole for whole long format
[28:42] content do you see um this shorten
[28:46] attention span this higher time
[28:48] preference this the the dick ification
[28:51] of every platform as a as a big problem
[28:55] is it a trend or is it just something
[28:57] that is now and keeps will will reverse
[29:00] itself I don't know
[29:03] I I think it's just in a way it's
[29:09] Evolution
[29:11] um just like when TV came first like
[29:15] before TV people had to really if they
[29:18] wanted to be entertained they would go
[29:20] to plays or listen to concerts or read
[29:23] books and then TV came and you have the
[29:25] entertainment available in your living
[29:27] room room that was already a big
[29:29] change was it For Better or For Worse
[29:32] it's difficult to say it is what it is
[29:34] because we we can't really go back and
[29:37] and undo it so I I
[29:40] think the cat is out of the back I don't
[29:42] think we going to go back like there's
[29:45] there's really no no point in doing that
[29:48] I guess what's going to happen is that
[29:50] if people find that you know it's
[29:52] harmful to use this short form content
[29:55] only then we will naturally gravitate
[29:58] back towards different kinds of content
[30:00] sort of like you know when animals they
[30:02] physically they feel ill like they're
[30:04] missing fiber or something the cats eat
[30:06] some grass or the plants or dogs you
[30:10] know to balance their body and I think
[30:13] human beings are no different physically
[30:16] so if there's something that we're doing
[30:17] to hurt ourselves our our bodies and
[30:19] Minds will find a way to balance it
[30:22] out I I just this just came in my mind I
[30:27] watched uh Mr Beast video uh I think a
[30:30] week ago and I don't watch his videos a
[30:32] lot but my girlfriend watched it so I
[30:34] was like let's let's watch it together
[30:37] and uh there was an experience where two
[30:40] people were completely strangers were in
[30:42] a uh cell for 100 days and they got some
[30:47] options along the way do you want TVs
[30:50] stuff like that but they had to pay uh a
[30:52] price for that they like if they
[30:54] survived the 100 days they got half a
[30:57] milli million EUR and if they want to
[30:59] have like a bat they have to pay 50,000
[31:02] from that they if they want a TV they
[31:04] want they have to have stuff like that
[31:07] uh for this first 70 days they were
[31:10] really strong did not got uh seduced by
[31:13] any uh TV options or bad options did not
[31:16] spend any money and then on Day 70 they
[31:20] offered them everything like all the
[31:23] nicest food all the TV options all the
[31:26] best bad and stuff like that for like a
[31:29] low price of course they went for it and
[31:31] this was not bad it was a good decision
[31:33] I think and but the interesting thing is
[31:35] from Day 70 onwards they um got way more
[31:41] into fighting and way more uh in the
[31:44] hairs of each other than in the first 70
[31:47] days where they had almost nothing like
[31:49] shitty bats they could couldn't even
[31:51] turn down the
[31:52] lightings uh it was always just like
[31:55] really bright so they could not sleep
[31:56] nicely
[31:57] and sometimes I feel like with
[32:00] everything available all the time with
[32:02] like Tik Tok always there you can just
[32:05] open it and you can spend two hours in
[32:08] there be entertained and don't have to
[32:11] think yourself about what you're doing
[32:13] it just makes us I think uh less happy
[32:17] in general but that's just a random
[32:19] thought about what I came up to my mind
[32:22] do you have any thoughts about
[32:25] that yeah it is true that the scarcity
[32:28] in many many occasions is behind the
[32:32] subjective value because you tend to
[32:34] Value stuff that you don't have that's
[32:36] why people are interested in in chances
[32:38] to get rich quick um because they don't
[32:42] have money usually people who have money
[32:45] are I wouldn't say usually but often
[32:47] times people who have a lot of money
[32:50] they get quite unhappy and and you know
[32:53] OD on drugs or something like that even
[32:56] they have everything available or maybe
[32:59] that's because I don't know I wouldn't
[33:01] know but I suspect that it has to do
[33:04] with with having too much uh
[33:08] optionality in a way restriction
[33:11] especially if if you impose the
[33:13] restrictions on yourself and somebody
[33:15] else is not imposing them like somebody
[33:17] imprisons you or takes steals away from
[33:19] you that's not like that's artificial
[33:21] scarcity that's what government does
[33:22] essentially so that's not real scarcity
[33:25] real scarcity is like when you're born
[33:27] you're you're born naked to the world
[33:29] you have nothing and that's where you
[33:31] start to build your wealth upon and and
[33:34] you have nothing and you attain
[33:36] something you enjoy it fully because you
[33:39] know that you put your work in that and
[33:41] you deserve that and I would argue that
[33:44] at least for me um I enjoy watching TV
[33:48] or or playing video games way more after
[33:51] I feel like I've earned it like if after
[33:53] I worked hard and then I want to take a
[33:55] break instead of of if I if I play like
[33:59] five hours video game it gets worse and
[34:02] worse and worse it's uh the law of
[34:05] diminishing returns so the more I have
[34:08] something the more I the less I value
[34:11] it so I guess going back to the the self
[34:15] moderation or finding like the
[34:16] homeostasis of Mind and Body alike I I
[34:21] think we are self- adjusting it's just a
[34:24] matter of do we really listen to
[34:25] ourselves like do we see past the C
[34:29] cognitive dissonance that you know what
[34:31] what the governments and what TV and
[34:33] what the marketers and big corporations
[34:36] tell us that we want that we need and we
[34:38] need to get this and that uh to be happy
[34:42] but we don't feel it really so that
[34:44] creates cognitive
[34:46] dissonance so I think what what really
[34:48] is rewarding way to live is to work and
[34:52] and earn gather resources make
[34:55] investments and that way um Elevate
[34:59] yourself on the steps of Life towards
[35:01] the self-actualization which is the
[35:03] which is the top uh top shelf of life
[35:06] where you can really start to enjoy and
[35:09] and realize your Ambitions instead of
[35:12] just running in this Rat Race and
[35:14] getting this and getting that knee
[35:16] jerking into every impulse that is
[35:19] imposed upon you without looking inwards
[35:23] and thinking like what is it that I'm
[35:25] really good at what is it that I really
[35:27] enjoy doing and and just instead of
[35:30] taking it from somebody else yeah that's
[35:33] uh that's it's really beautiful and very
[35:36] true there are two things that just came
[35:38] up uh one thing I before I went into
[35:41] Bitcoin um I was into stocks I was into
[35:45] uh finding the new cash flow car and I
[35:49] also went into Tesla and it was since I
[35:53] like 19 a big dream of mine to have once
[35:55] a Tesla and I also put like an Instagram
[35:58] story out I want to have a Tesla one day
[36:00] and I got into the Tesla stock and it
[36:04] went crazy up so I just had I did a lot
[36:07] of research it went down before but uh
[36:10] still I did not know fully what I I I
[36:13] did there so I got I guess I was getting
[36:16] lucky and I got so lucky that I could
[36:20] afford a Tesla so I bought a Tesla and
[36:24] it was a really really interes
[36:27] experience for me because the first
[36:29] month is amazing you have the vehicle
[36:32] it's an really fast one uh every time
[36:35] you take uh friends or family or
[36:38] whatever uh with with you it's it's fun
[36:41] to see them um enjoying it with you but
[36:45] after like one or two month it's just a
[36:48] car and and now I'm having a niss and
[36:51] leaf it's it's just same experience for
[36:54] me it's like it's a it's a car it's a it
[36:56] drives me from A to B and uh it it
[37:00] teached me really soon because I was
[37:02] only like 21 or 22 that age teach me
[37:05] really soon
[37:06] that something that I dreamed so hard
[37:10] about and obsessed so hard about isn't
[37:13] that great when you have it then because
[37:15] it then you have it every day it's in
[37:17] the garage you can take it out every
[37:19] time you want so that's that was an
[37:21] interesting experience for me yeah I
[37:24] think that's an interesting one yeah in
[37:26] eneral things that are attainable are
[37:29] not great goals like what what then like
[37:33] once you attain it what then like what's
[37:35] the next thing you need a next thing you
[37:37] need the need a fix so I like to shoot
[37:40] for something that is unattainable like
[37:43] total freedom for example that's a good
[37:45] example you can always try to be more
[37:48] free um you know or or striving to be
[37:53] perfect you know you're never going to
[37:54] be perfect but you can always try to be
[37:57] a little bit better every day and that
[37:59] that's how you uh you find a reason to
[38:02] live every day because you always have a
[38:04] goal to strive for the next steps to
[38:06] strive forth and you know you're never
[38:08] going to reach it but it's not about
[38:10] reaching the goal it's not about getting
[38:12] your Tesla and then you're happy because
[38:15] we're never going to be happy we we are
[38:17] human beings we thrive on action and in
[38:20] action would lead to the you know the
[38:22] heat death of of the University nothing
[38:24] moves and there's nothing to strive for
[38:27] or if we would live forever we will be
[38:29] Gods then we would do nothing because we
[38:31] can always postpone it um to tomorrow so
[38:35] the scarcity of our time makes it
[38:38] valuable makes every action
[38:42] expensive and everything becomes an
[38:46] investment so I think running
[38:51] materialistic running after
[38:52] materialistic things can be extremely
[38:55] unsatisfy buying at least it was for me
[38:58] because I guess we realize that our time
[39:01] is way more valuable than like let's say
[39:04] I work for a year really hard and I get
[39:06] my Tesla or or I get a home theater
[39:09] system or whatever it is that I think
[39:10] that I need and want and once I wrap it
[39:13] up and and uh play play with it for a
[39:16] month I get bored with it again and I
[39:19] just wasted a year on it Without Really
[39:22] um advancing myself on the step of life
[39:26] I've Advanced myself on the material
[39:30] materialistic uh steps which is
[39:32] essentially just Gathering stuff that I
[39:34] now need to worry about and take care of
[39:36] and pay insurance on and you know buy
[39:39] gas for or
[39:41] whatever so it doesn't really increase
[39:44] my freedom it's the opposite in fact so
[39:47] then once I became a freedom maximalist
[39:50] I realized that I want less stuff not
[39:53] more I just want good quality stuff and
[39:56] as little as
[39:58] possible because that increases my
[40:01] freedom like this is something that I
[40:03] realized after I I I um burned out in my
[40:06] Fiat career and I sold everything I went
[40:09] traveling with with uh with no
[40:11] possessions like everything I owned fit
[40:12] in my backpack which was like 32
[40:16] lers and uh the level of freedom I
[40:19] experienced during that trip was just
[40:20] like a game changer for me I've never
[40:24] been so free and whenever I settle down
[40:27] somewhere I gradually start becoming
[40:30] less and less free by putting down these
[40:33] anchors you know getting a house getting
[40:35] a well I don't have a car but let's say
[40:37] I had a car you know all those things or
[40:39] a job they are anchors uh that diminish
[40:43] your
[40:44] freedom so I I to sum it up I would just
[40:47] say that everybody needs a goal so
[40:51] figure out what the goal is and make the
[40:53] goal unattainable so that you can always
[40:56] drive for it and you said that you're
[40:59] also a digital Nomad so you're also um
[41:03] still moving around a lot uh how are you
[41:07] doing it like are you staying one year
[41:09] in in or like half a year or just month
[41:12] or like longer or how is the Journey of
[41:15] digital
[41:17] NAD I used to do it like that like
[41:19] maximum one year in one place but uh I
[41:23] moved to Madera a little bit over two
[41:26] years ago and I like it so much that i'
[41:30] I've just stayed here instead and it's
[41:34] the first place that I really had the
[41:35] feeling that I don't really want
[41:37] to go somewhere I mean I still like
[41:40] traveling but it's just too damn
[41:42] comfortable here maybe I'm getting all
[41:43] old as well but uh yeah right now I'm
[41:46] staying staying in Mya maybe maybe we'll
[41:49] go
[41:50] traveling at some point again but right
[41:53] now I'm just focusing on work and moera
[41:57] is a great place for remote work the
[41:59] internet is fantastic I mean you have
[42:01] everything available it's small it's not
[42:02] too big and it's not too small either
[42:05] weather is
[42:06] perfect um lots of bitcoiners coming in
[42:10] nowadays so that's pretty cool I
[42:12] recommend everybody to check it out for
[42:16] the end of the podcast I want to read
[42:18] another post to you from you uh which is
[42:21] not related to bitcoin at all or maybe
[42:24] it is for you uh um one of the most
[42:28] widely accepted scams in fra framing
[42:31] weak feminine psycho man as masculine
[42:36] what is masculinity for you and and what
[42:39] what did trigger you to to writing uh
[42:42] the
[42:44] post what triggered me is that you know
[42:47] like to me masculinity is the The Urge
[42:52] the uh the
[42:54] need uh to protect
[42:56] others to provide for others usually for
[43:01] your family but also for other other
[43:02] people to stand up for something that
[43:04] you believe to hold standards not just
[43:08] um uphold somebody else's ideas and
[43:10] standards but have your own and and be
[43:13] your own man and be a freedom maximalist
[43:15] and of course masculinity is a is a male
[43:19] trait and the unfortunate thing about
[43:21] that is we have this concept called
[43:24] toxic masculinity which is basically
[43:27] something that came with with feminism
[43:29] late late stage
[43:31] feminism um and it doesn't really mean
[43:35] it has nothing to do with masculinity in
[43:36] my opinion it's it's more like these
[43:39]  guys who treat treat their
[43:42] family or their women
[43:44] poorly and and that is called like this
[43:47] kind of like ma Macho Man type of
[43:51] mentality that is that is now what
[43:53] passes as
[43:54] masculinity and and then that's just
[43:57] that's just plain wrong in my opinion
[43:59] like Psychopaths and and are
[44:01] psychopaths and and we should
[44:02] call them as such like if there is only
[44:05] one rule that I have the only only one
[44:07] standard that I derive all my morality
[44:09] from and that is do not steal so
[44:13] everything that is wrong in Human Action
[44:16] relates to stealing lying is a form of
[44:19] stealing because you steal the the
[44:22] everybody's right to
[44:23] truth um yeah there's of course other
[44:26] kinds of
[44:27] stealing taxation being one of the
[44:29] mostly W widely accepted
[44:32] ones but like um abusive relationship
[44:36] that's also stealing or taking away
[44:38] somebody's Liberty to be not under fear
[44:42] and not under aggression and that's also
[44:44] like this kind of toxic masculinity
[44:46] which is not really masculinity it's
[44:48] more like
[44:49] just um you know bad
[44:52] behavior is is rooted in weakness it's
[44:56] rooted in U inability to control
[45:00] yourself so you didn't want to control
[45:03] somebody else because you are somehow
[45:05] stronger or smarter or you have more
[45:07] resources and this is what governments
[45:09] do as well they're like abusive
[45:13] spouses so that they leverage their
[45:15] position to keep you under control to
[45:18] make themsel feel more powerful and
[45:20] that's that's exactly what toxic M
[45:22] masculinity is about but real
[45:24] masculinity is opposite of that it will
[45:27] Elevate people it will protect people it
[45:30] will um teach people guide people
[45:34] without initiating violence so it all
[45:37] comes down to the non-aggression
[45:38] principle and not stealing from people
[45:41] everything else is is just free game
[45:44] free
[45:46] market that's uh that's beautiful um we
[45:49] have an end routine at the podcast where
[45:51] the previous guest asked a question for
[45:53] the next guest and
[45:56] uh your question is from the previous
[45:58] guest what is enough privacy for you H
[46:03] that's a interesting and open-ended
[46:05] question enough
[46:07] privacy
[46:09] um I
[46:11] guess the best way to think about
[46:13] privacy in my opinion is the ability to
[46:17] selectively reveal yourself
[46:20] like I don't need absolute anonymity or
[46:25] I don't even want that like I I just
[46:27] want to be in control of to whom and
[46:31] where and how I'm going to expose myself
[46:34] and my life to right
[46:37] so yeah to be able to selectively reveal
[46:41] myself that will be
[46:43] sufficient um how to get there that's a
[46:46] a little bit complicated answer because
[46:49] there's not really it's not really well
[46:51] understood and well known how much
[46:53] surveillance technology is actually
[46:55] around us so i' rather not think about
[46:57] it so I I guess there's where sort of
[47:00] living in a world where you don't really
[47:02] have sufficient privacy but in an ideal
[47:05] world yeah that's that's how it would be
[47:07] like total control of when and where to
[47:10] reveal yourself there I think the
[47:12] optionality is really the the thing
[47:14] where the power comes from because when
[47:16] you can choose where and when uh you can
[47:19] reveal yourself because I also chose to
[47:22] reveal myself as a bitcoiner on every
[47:25] every social media platform with my real
[47:28] name with my real face uh without any
[47:32] obsc um I chose to do that uh but people
[47:36] should not be um like everybody should
[47:39] have the option to do what they they
[47:41] want with their personal data yeah very
[47:44] very true um where can people find you
[47:47] the best is X the best platform uh to
[47:49] find the consensus Network and yourself
[47:53] personally yeah X is the best and uh I'm
[47:56] also on telegram with the same tag so
[47:59] omn that's me and then consensus n is um
[48:03] is the company the Publishing House
