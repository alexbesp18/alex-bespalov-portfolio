[00:00] every single fiat currency has
[00:01] eventually collapsed normies who don't
[00:03] care about the technical stuff are not
[00:05] going to come in until they have a
[00:07] seamless user experience and it's
[00:08] Pleasant and easy to transact and use
[00:11] Bitcoins I've been in finance for 20
[00:13] years and I understood nothing about
[00:14] money I do look at it as a Time chain
[00:16] it's somewhere where you can record
[00:17] history in a way that it can't ever be
[00:19] erased there's a shift anyway away from
[00:21] the current payment networks which don't
[00:23] really work very well at all and are
[00:25] centrally controlled and become very
[00:27] political to A system that is completely
[00:29] a itical that anybody can join where
[00:31] anybody can transact so I think that the
[00:33] lightning network is going to be really
[00:35] important you don't have to go through
[00:36] all the faf putting in your credit card
[00:37] your name your address now all that
[00:39] stuff's on a database and it's a honey
[00:41] pot for someone to steal and approprate
[00:43] your identity no you just do a lightning
[00:45] payment bam done trade should just be
[00:46] free taxation shouldn't happen if you're
[00:48] doing business with people you shouldn't
[00:50] be taxed on it I'm happy to pay for
[00:52] things like roads and Sewer networks and
[00:54] things like that government should be
[00:55] service providers I just noticed that
[00:57] governments are becoming increasingly
[00:59] less relevant as a benefit like they're
[01:01] providing no benefit and they're
[01:03] actually causing more problems than
[01:05] they're they're solving you might not
[01:06] care about politics but politics cares
[01:08] about you I encourage people maybe to
[01:10] consider Bitcoin as the second coming
[01:12] I've ascribe a lot to the theory that
[01:13] we're living in a simulation so I think
[01:15] Bitcoin might be something that has been
[01:17] put into our Matrix to fix a program
[01:20] that is going
[01:24] wrong you told me in the in the
[01:27] preparation you have an unpopular
[01:29] opinion about about Bitcoin being too
[01:31] technical
[01:34] oh I was like what what what could there
[01:36] be unpopular uh what is what is
[01:40] that yeah well uh it's it's not so much
[01:43] about Bitcoin well it is about Bitcoin
[01:45] being too technical but okay so the
[01:46] unpopular opinion is um I think men are
[01:50] very good at building things like you
[01:51] know they're very good at kind of
[01:53] thinking about the engineering side of
[01:55] things and making something actually
[01:57] work I don't think they're very good
[01:59] about the aesthetic six um or the user
[02:01] experience and so my observation I'm
[02:04] class of 2021 for Bitcoin so my
[02:07] observation coming into this space was
[02:09] that you know the wallets and all of
[02:11] this kind of stuff I mean on paper they
[02:13] work like they do what they say they're
[02:15] going to do but they're absolutely
[02:16] horrible to use and
[02:19] so I think women tend not to be Builders
[02:22] and this is obviously like an a sweeping
[02:24] statement there are exceptions that
[02:26] prove that rule some women are Builders
[02:28] and some women are Co ERS and Engineers
[02:31] but typically they're not drawn to those
[02:33] kind of subjects as much um but I think
[02:36] what women are really good at is making
[02:38] a space or an experience uh Pleasant you
[02:42] know so that could be a living space it
[02:44] could be like ux of an app on your phone
[02:47] it could be you know I don't know events
[02:50] things like that so I think women are
[02:52] very good generally at like creating a
[02:53] very pleasant experience and ambian mood
[02:55] or whatever um and so I think the reason
[02:58] that we don't see a lot of women in
[03:00] Bitcoin in part is because the ux is so
[03:03] terrible so they come in and they start
[03:05] wanting to look at the tools and using
[03:07] them and they just find that the
[03:09] experience is horrible and they don't
[03:10] have time they can't be bothered they
[03:12] just get frustrated and I think a man
[03:15] again very generalizing here but
[03:16] responds to that differently so a man
[03:18] might look at it and be like this is a
[03:20] problem I have to solve it's a challenge
[03:23] I need to go fix this um and I think
[03:26] that that's part of the reason why we
[03:27] don't see as much of that and also why
[03:29] we don't see as much mass adoption to be
[03:31] honest I think normies who don't care
[03:34] about the technical stuff are not going
[03:36] to come in until they have a seamless
[03:38] user experience and it's Pleasant and
[03:40] easy to transact and use Bitcoin so
[03:44] that's my unpopular
[03:45] opinion I think I think it's not very I
[03:48] think it's just like factual opinion
[03:51] it's very it's very very true in my
[03:53] opinion um it's interesting I think I
[03:56] have an interesting uh comparison to
[03:58] that I lived single for like one and a
[04:01] half years in Munich uh and people came
[04:04] to my apartment like one year after I
[04:06] moved in and like oh you just moved in
[04:07] right no no lie I'm already one year
[04:09] living here because I had just my Bare
[04:13] Essentials like I had a kitchen I had a
[04:15] bath obviously uh and then I had a bed a
[04:17] couch and a and a desk that's it no
[04:19] plants no pictures Nothing Fancy no no
[04:23] living room and now I I'm in a living
[04:27] relationship and I I love it so much and
[04:29] my apartment actually looks like someone
[04:32] living here like it looks actually like
[04:34] it's a good place to hang out it's a
[04:36] good place to live so so I think those
[04:39] two pictures of my Apartments then and
[04:41] now I think that's the perfect
[04:42] definition of a single
[04:45] man household and someone living in a
[04:48] relationship where someone actually
[04:51] cares about if there's a plant or if
[04:53] there is the bed in that corner or that
[04:55] corner like that makes a huge difference
[04:57] and I don't care about it but I love it
[05:00] more when it's uh nice and when it feels
[05:03] good and when the environment is good
[05:05] but I'm too lazy to do it so I think
[05:07] that's a great uh comparison to what you
[05:09] just said because Bitcoin uh man like
[05:13] completely uh generalizing here but uh
[05:16] man are like oh it should work it like
[05:17] the Bitcoin should go from A to B but
[05:20] all yeah the user experience would also
[05:21] be nice there should be some animation
[05:23] there and stuff like that and do we need
[05:25] that that female energy more in the in
[05:27] the Bitcoin space um I think for Mass
[05:30] adoption yes I
[05:32] mean do you know Michelle Weekley um
[05:35] she's an American girl that's in the
[05:37] Bitcoin space but she made a my podcast
[05:40] oh she was oh she's amazing but I quote
[05:42] her a lot because she she put this post
[05:44] up on Twitter and this was way before I
[05:46] knew her um I think she said we don't
[05:49] need more women in Bitcoin we need more
[05:51] women with Bitcoin um and I would tend
[05:54] to agree in the sense that I think
[05:55] actually holding it and understanding it
[05:57] is the most important thing like it does
[05:59] doesn't really matter if I don't know I
[06:01] mean all this stuff of like seeing
[06:03] yourself represented like whatever you
[06:05] know I I don't know that that really
[06:06] matters that much but I do think that
[06:09] because we don't have more women in the
[06:11] space the mass adoption is harder um
[06:16] because we're not really meeting a wider
[06:17] segment of people's needs and I don't
[06:19] mean just meeting women's needs I think
[06:21] we're also not meeting many men's needs
[06:23] either so they're very technical men
[06:25] that very interested in like the
[06:26] engineering stuff and they're interested
[06:28] in the philosophy and they're quite
[06:29] disagreeable you know they're really
[06:31] drawn to the space but you know the
[06:33] other guys that may be not that way are
[06:35] not so much so I think for Mass adoption
[06:38] we do need to get more women in the
[06:39] space and get them more active and
[06:41] actually contributing to building things
[06:44] and running companies and you know just
[06:47] being a bit more
[06:48] prominent yeah and I think that more
[06:51] women in Bitcoin will bring more women
[06:53] with Bitcoin if you understand what I
[06:55] mean yeah like more
[06:58] people more people talking about that
[07:00] and more people that's why I'm really
[07:02] passionate about uh bringing everyone to
[07:05] to to the small stage that I created
[07:06] here in the podcast uh I'm famous for
[07:09] bringing people on that haven't been on
[07:11] a podcast before like 10 or 15% of my
[07:14] podcast guests are completely unknown
[07:16] some of them didn't even had a social
[07:19] media account before really uh they were
[07:21] completely completely no names in the
[07:23] digital realm how nice for them you
[07:26] ruined it
[07:31] I was I was C seeing them do the Bitcoin
[07:37] space but yeah that's an interesting way
[07:39] to look at it but yeah that that's uh
[07:42] that's what I I try to do and and I
[07:44] think the more different people and
[07:46] perspectives we get to bitcoin the more
[07:48] different people and perspectives do we
[07:50] get into Bitcoin so we we this role
[07:53] model thing is is is is real and it's
[07:55] not only like women and and and and and
[07:57] Men it's just like oh yeah like there's
[07:59] a science teacher and when he talks
[08:01] about Bitcoin uh that probably resonates
[08:04] with other science teachers like that
[08:06] there's those small things and we cannot
[08:08] just have Michael sailor doing all the
[08:10] Bitcoin podcasts we need all of them I
[08:13] still had him on because he's Michael
[08:15] sailor but uh we we we need so many
[08:17] different uh voice and and I think
[08:19] that's that's that's where we get into
[08:21] that it's interesting that you had him
[08:23] on because I I to be honest I get a
[08:24] little bit sick of seeing Michael sailor
[08:26] everywhere and I'm I'm not nearly as
[08:27] into him as everyone else is but there's
[08:29] one question that I would like to ask
[08:31] him that I don't think anyone has asked
[08:33] him which is why are you buying up all
[08:35] the Bitcoin so he's buying up all the
[08:37] Bitcoin as I understand it's all being
[08:39] custodi in uh coinbase and so you've got
[08:43] this giant Honeypot of a load of Bitcoin
[08:46] that he's borrowing money like it's
[08:48] going out of fashion to buy and I'm like
[08:50] why is he doing that wouldn't he want
[08:52] other people to be buying the Bitcoin or
[08:54] is he planning on buying it and then
[08:56] giving it to people that don't have it I
[08:58] don't I just I'm super confused about
[09:00] what his motivations are I don't know
[09:02] whether you had any inkling of that when
[09:04] you spoke to him I I don't
[09:06] know I feel like he might uh like that's
[09:10] I have no knowledge about that I didn't
[09:12] speak with him about that but I think uh
[09:15] he might give away a big portion of his
[09:18] Bitcoin when he dies or something like
[09:20] that because he he cannot spend it all
[09:22] like he has so many Bitcoin and there's
[09:23] also like a difference between Michael
[09:26] strategy having Bitcoin and him having
[09:27] Bitcoin uh because we don't know where
[09:30] his personal Bitcoin are but we know
[09:32] where micro strategy holds the Bitcoin
[09:34] like micro strategy holds like 210 or
[09:36] 220,000 Bitcoin I I I lost lost keeping
[09:40] track of of the huge number of Bitcoin
[09:42] they have and then there's also him
[09:44] personally and we know that he has at
[09:48] least 177,000 Bitcoin personally that's
[09:51] a huge number uh without even micro
[09:53] strategy um so where he has them maybe
[09:57] he has self custody maybe has some multi
[10:00] signature I don't know what what he
[10:01] personally does probably not that
[10:04] different to what he does with the
[10:05] company um but uh I I think if you have
[10:10] that huge amount of Bitcoin either you
[10:12] give it to your family or you might give
[10:15] it away or he does the ultimate thing
[10:18] that a lot of people say like just
[10:21] transfer to a wallet throw away the key
[10:23] and and give it to humanity back and
[10:25] burn the Bitcoin forever like that would
[10:27] be also something interesting
[10:30] yeah it's interesting actually because I
[10:31] I made a comment on somebody's thread
[10:33] the other day and nobody responded to it
[10:35] but I I was like what happens when all
[10:37] the Bitcoin is lost because the Bitcoin
[10:39] obviously can be lost and we've already
[10:41] lost a ton of it so what happens when
[10:43] all of it gets lost that's an
[10:45] interesting question right at some point
[10:47] that's going to happen I mean it has to
[10:49] even if it's like a 100 years 200 years
[10:51] at some point it's going to Trend
[10:52] towards 100% loss I mean I don't know if
[10:57] we ever get to the point where every
[10:59] thing gets
[11:02] lost if I mean because it's uh because
[11:06] it's uh digital you you can make a soft
[11:09] for and you can make one sets divided by
[11:13] a number of reasons you can actually
[11:15] make the whole thing work with just one
[11:17] set and just divide it in so many
[11:19] different uh smaller units that you can
[11:22] actually make the whole uh system work
[11:24] with just like a few units because 21
[11:28] million Bitcoin is just just just a
[11:30] random number it could well be also 50
[11:32] million or just 1 million or like 15
[11:35] million it doesn't really matter it just
[11:37] you have to divide it that everyone can
[11:40] use a little bit uh so but it's an
[11:43] interesting question what happens if
[11:46] everything gets lost like literally the
[11:48] last set getting lost I don't like I
[11:51] never thought about that like that's
[11:53] really interesting this never nobody
[11:55] ever brought that
[11:57] up what what's your thoughts around that
[11:59] do do you think uh Bitcoin will get to a
[12:02] point uh to if in Thousand or 100, years
[12:06] where every set is getting
[12:08] lost I mean it kind of has to I think
[12:10] logic would dictate that it has to like
[12:12] it would have to Trend towards zero
[12:14] because we've lost how many Bitcoin
[12:15] already is it six million five million
[12:17] something like that there was some like
[12:20] number my number is always six million
[12:22] that I use but it's obviously there are
[12:24] no no real official number but my
[12:27] estimation is around four to six
[12:29] Millions yeah I mean so if there's only
[12:31] 21 million and it's only taken us what
[12:33] 15 years to lose that many I mean if we
[12:35] keep losing them at the same rate which
[12:38] actually could very likely happen as you
[12:39] get Mass adoption you get more and more
[12:41] people making mistakes and then next
[12:43] thing you know um I don't know I don't
[12:46] know what would happen I don't know I
[12:50] mean sorry but uh but I think we're also
[12:54] getting better in ciding them because I
[12:56] feel like uh a lot of Bitcoin got lost
[12:58] because because people didn't knew or
[13:00] they they just like mened minded a lot
[13:04] of them in 2010 11 12 they left it on a
[13:08] laptop and there were like 100,000
[13:11] Bitcoin on there because they let the
[13:13] the laptop run for a few weeks or months
[13:15] even and then they throw out the the
[13:20] laptop because they didn't even think
[13:22] about Bitcoin and then like years later
[13:24] oh I threw I threw out a few
[13:26] millions or few billions uh worth of uh
[13:29] of Bitcoin and I think we are way more
[13:33] aware and I just think of my custody
[13:38] thinking like from from the first time I
[13:41] ever thought about custody I actually
[13:43] I'm I'm I think one of the few people
[13:46] that custody their Bitcoin in self
[13:48] custody on day one like the first time
[13:51] they I bought Bitcoin I directly went to
[13:53] to a leer back then in four years later
[13:55] four years ago but I think we're just
[13:58] getting way better
[14:00] I think I studied Bitcoin for about six
[14:02] months to a year before I actually
[14:03] bought any as well I just
[14:06] was yeah I just kind of wanted to
[14:08] understand it I was really more
[14:09] enthralled with the philosophy of it
[14:10] than than I think a lot of people think
[14:12] of it like a get rich quick thing and
[14:14] I'll be honest I wasn't terribly
[14:16] interested in that I was just kind of
[14:17] like me you know I don't think of like
[14:19] oh I'd retire because like why would you
[14:21] retire I mean I really like working so
[14:23] why would I why would I ever stop um so
[14:27] yeah I don't know I was just really
[14:28] fascinated by it um I I just kind of
[14:31] love the idea that it was something that
[14:33] could completely I I came from a
[14:35] background in financial markets I spent
[14:37] 20 years in financial markets and I
[14:40] could see that there was something not
[14:41] right with the system but when you're in
[14:42] it it's quite hard to identify what that
[14:44] is um and I tell people a story a lot as
[14:47] well of how like um I started my career
[14:49] at Bloomberg in finance I started in
[14:51] events organizing and then I moved to
[14:53] finance um and we they they invest a lot
[14:56] in training you there so we did lots of
[14:58] like training sessions lots of Economics
[15:00] Finance training that kind of thing and
[15:03] I remember asking one of the economics
[15:05] tutors she was we were doing Bond math
[15:08] and she was explaining to us how to like
[15:10] price bonds and I asked her about
[15:12] inflation and I said well why do we even
[15:14] have inflation like what what's the
[15:16] mechanism that creates it and I just
[15:18] remember she was scribbling on the
[15:19] Whiteboard and she turned around and she
[15:21] went well because people keep asking for
[15:23] higher wages obviously like that's the
[15:25] reason
[15:26] why and this was somebody who had like I
[15:29] think an like a a MERS in economics not
[15:32] just a a a degree and um and I was kind
[15:35] of like okay that doesn't really make
[15:37] sense because you know you get more
[15:39] experience in your job and therefore
[15:41] you're worth more as an employee so
[15:43] therefore you have a right to charge
[15:45] more older Generations are retiring so
[15:48] they're coming out of the workforce so
[15:50] you're basically replacing them as they
[15:51] retire as you move up the corporate
[15:53] ladder and then you've got Junior people
[15:55] coming in who are new who are
[15:57] inexperienced so obviously they get paid
[15:59] less because they bring less to the
[16:00] table so that explanation didn't really
[16:02] make sense but I never was able to get
[16:05] from anybody in financial markets a
[16:07] proper explanation as to why that was
[16:10] happening and it was actually a Jordan
[16:13] Peterson interview that he did with four
[16:14] bit Corners that I listened to so I'd
[16:16] left I was working at an investment bank
[16:17] and I left and I had a couple of months
[16:19] on gardening leave where I basically
[16:21] could just do what I wanted before
[16:22] moving I live in Canada so I was moving
[16:24] from New York to Canada and
[16:27] um and I was you know thinking what
[16:30] should I do next and I had a bunch of
[16:31] colleagues that had gone to crypto
[16:33] companies so it's was actually weirdly
[16:34] my mom who orange peeled me so I I said
[16:37] to her you know I'm like thinking I want
[16:38] to do something different with my life I
[16:40] don't want to work in finance and you
[16:42] know crypto looks quite interesting and
[16:44] she said oh you know she's really into
[16:46] Jordan Peterson she's like oh Jordan
[16:47] Peterson's just interviewed these
[16:49] bitcoiners you should listen to his
[16:50] thing and she hadn't listened to it but
[16:53] I was like that's weird like isn't he a
[16:55] clinical psychologist like why is he
[16:57] interviewing bitcoiners um and it was
[17:00] actually a Bitcoin book club that he had
[17:02] a conversation with and they were
[17:04] studying Jordan Peterson's book uh maps
[17:07] of meaning which is kind of like a book
[17:09] about I don't know how you describe it
[17:11] really I've actually just finished it
[17:13] three years later it's very heavy going
[17:16] um but they were basically listening to
[17:18] the the the or studying the book for
[17:20] their book club and asked Jordan
[17:21] Peterson if he would come and do a a
[17:23] talk with them and it was 90 minutes
[17:27] long and it just blew my mind I just
[17:28] listen to it and I was like oh my God
[17:30] like everything I've believed for 20
[17:32] years and this whole ecosystem I've been
[17:34] in is just a complete sham and my mom
[17:36] calls me up the next day and she's like
[17:38] oh Have you listened to it yet is it
[17:40] worth listening to and I was just like
[17:42] it's completely changed my life she's
[17:44] like
[17:45] what I was just like I've been in
[17:48] finance for 20 years and I understood
[17:50] nothing about money like I've learned
[17:51] more in those 90 minutes than I did in
[17:53] 20 years in finance and it was just
[17:55] mind-blowing so at that point I was just
[17:57] like down the rabbit hole and then I've
[17:59] read Jeff Boo's book I listened to
[18:01] actually his podcast series on on what
[18:03] is money and then I've read his book uh
[18:05] the price of tomorrow and I was just
[18:08] completely blown away I was like oh my
[18:10] God this is like the entire world I live
[18:12] in is not what I thought it was and I'm
[18:14] sure you can empathize with that because
[18:16] then you just go down this crazy Rabbit
[18:18] Hole so I was really kind of busy
[18:20] studying it and trying to understand it
[18:22] and figure out what it was um and then I
[18:26] went and volunteered for a Bitcoin
[18:28] Meetup
[18:29] in Toronto at the time I was living in
[18:31] Toronto and I was they were like the
[18:33] oldest Meetup in Toronto and you know
[18:36] they kind of taught me about wallets and
[18:38] how seed phrases worked and things like
[18:39] that so it was a big chunk of time
[18:41] really before I actually took the leap
[18:43] and thought yeah you know I'll try out
[18:45] but yes I was the same as you I self-
[18:46] custodi straight away um you
[18:51] know that's interesting uh that you
[18:53] brought up the salary thing I love that
[18:56] uh that how you got orange build but but
[18:59] uh do do you think
[19:01] we I I Tak now a little bit of my salary
[19:04] basically of my sponsorships in in
[19:06] Bitcoin so I'm prepared of getting less
[19:09] and less Sates for a higher value of act
[19:15] work work do are we ready for decreasing
[19:19] salaries like are are we ready for uh
[19:21] each year actually decreasing our
[19:23] salaries because the purchasing power
[19:25] goes up and if we don't keep up with
[19:28] like the purchasing power increase of
[19:29] Bitcoin that could be an interesting
[19:31] thing in the Bitcoin world I mean I
[19:34] would argue does a salary need to
[19:35] decrease I mean the because you're
[19:38] measuring it in well so I guess it
[19:41] depends what terms you're measuring in
[19:42] it in but if you if your Fiat salary
[19:46] stays the
[19:47] same
[19:49] then hang on a second if your Fiat
[19:52] salary stays the same well it depends if
[19:54] you buy Bitcoin with it or not right so
[19:56] if you if you keep getting paid in fat
[19:58] then you purchasing power will keep to
[20:00] keep decreasing but it's doing that
[20:01] anyway
[20:03] so I mean I I one thing that I've really
[20:07] struggled with a little bit and I still
[20:08] think about this a lot and I haven't
[20:10] really been able to kind of wrap my head
[20:12] around it
[20:13] is as as the purchasing power of money
[20:16] decreases or the value of money
[20:18] decreases you work harder so there's an
[20:21] incentive to do more and contribute more
[20:23] to society to the economy and you know
[20:25] we all hate our lives because we have to
[20:27] work too many hours and everybody's
[20:28] tired and you know overworked but
[20:31] everybody's producing so I keep asking
[20:34] myself what happens when the value of
[20:37] your savings keeps going up without you
[20:39] having to do anything your purchasing
[20:41] power increases what's the incentive to
[20:44] actually produce at that point you know
[20:46] so for example like I might produce food
[20:48] because I want to eat but you know
[20:52] what's my incentive to produce food for
[20:54] other people when I'm getting paid less
[20:56] and less and less for that same amount
[20:57] of Labor
[20:59] I think something very beautiful uh will
[21:01] happen where people don't have to work
[21:03] but actually find something you really
[21:06] want to do and like maybe I'm naive and
[21:10] maybe I'm just a dreamer but uh but even
[21:13] in that case I think that um people for
[21:18] example I get bored if I don't have
[21:20] anything to do like I sometimes take
[21:22] breaks they breaks are maximum like half
[21:25] a day a day um if if if I go on holidays
[21:28] maybe it's like two days but then on the
[21:30] second day I have to work something um
[21:33] so I think we are inclined to uh
[21:36] contribute something to community and
[21:39] something to uh society and we want to
[21:42] do something like just laying around on
[21:44] the beach and just laying around in
[21:46] front of the TV it's depressing after
[21:48] some time at least for me that's that's
[21:50] just my uh experience and there might be
[21:53] a small group of people that actually
[21:55] want to do that and they fine they can
[21:57] just scroll on their phone and watch TV
[21:59] all all day long uh they that's that's
[22:03] fine for me they they can watch the
[22:05] whole entire podcast of of of mine all
[22:08] day
[22:09] long at least they should watch
[22:11] something
[22:13] good but but um I think um people
[22:17] producing something will always be there
[22:21] because people want to be maybe
[22:23] meaningful they want they want more in
[22:26] in than money in life of course money is
[22:28] a big driver so maybe we come to a point
[22:31] where people actually think of like oh
[22:34] what do I actually want to do in life
[22:36] what what do I want to create in life
[22:38] and the basic things probably will be
[22:41] way more taken care of because of
[22:42] Robotics Ai and all those things and
[22:45] then we can think of more the bigger
[22:46] problems and more creative problems like
[22:48] oh how do we uh bring humans to other
[22:51] planets and what what what what uh other
[22:55] things and creative things should we do
[22:56] so that that's my positive
[22:59] way of thinking um I don't know if if
[23:02] actually I think it's actually in incend
[23:05] deves a good productivity and efficient
[23:08] productivity and kind of cuts out that
[23:11] oh I go to a job and be there eight
[23:13] hours just to be there eight hours so
[23:15] there this we have a lot of zombie
[23:18] companies I call them but I don't know
[23:21] what's what's your take on is oh yeah I
[23:24] mean I was going to ask you like who
[23:25] does the street sweeping but I guess in
[23:27] your in your vision the future would be
[23:29] robots which actually makes sense cuz I
[23:31] don't ho the house we have a robot that
[23:33] does it so I'm already I'm already
[23:36] partway there like I literally could not
[23:38] live without my ey robot it's the best
[23:40] thing ever
[23:42] invented I I think the free market will
[23:44] take actually care of that because if we
[23:47] didn't figure out um the the that robots
[23:51] can sweep the streets then we're not at
[23:54] a wealth status where everyone is so
[23:56] wealthy that they can just be creative
[23:58] and do whatever they want to do but if
[24:01] we at a status where everyone is as
[24:03] wealthy then this means we are already
[24:06] at the stage where we don't have to
[24:09] sweep the the streets and and do those
[24:12] things because we we figured out a way
[24:15] to do it more efficiently
[24:18] so I I think as long as we have um a
[24:22] free market as long as we can figure out
[24:25] a way uh uh to to keep competition
[24:29] alive then we will be will be fine in
[24:32] the long run so that's that's like
[24:34] that's why I love Bitcoin so much
[24:36] because it enables a free market and
[24:38] doesn't manipulate the the economy too
[24:42] much yeah it's funny because in some
[24:44] ways I wonder if we're living in what
[24:46] like future Generations will consider
[24:48] the Dark Ages like they'll look back on
[24:50] us and be like oh those poor people you
[24:51] know they had such miserable
[24:54] lives there had no meaning so so you're
[24:58] saying so you're saying we're living in
[24:59] a dark dark ages and the bright orange
[25:02] future is just coming around I mean I
[25:05] think so I think we are living in a bit
[25:06] of a Dark Age and I think we kind of
[25:08] think that we're not we're sort of
[25:09] deluded in thinking that we we kind of I
[25:12] don't know I mean it's funny I mean I do
[25:13] love a conspiracy theory and I do like
[25:15] going down some of these crazy rabbit
[25:17] holes but it is interesting sometimes
[25:20] when you look at things and you actually
[25:21] start to question things and you're like
[25:22] oh like are these things what I really
[25:25] believe them to be I mean I don't know
[25:26] if you've gone down the pyramid rabbit
[25:28] hole I was chatting to Tom Nelson about
[25:30] this on my podcast the other day um he's
[25:32] the guy that produced climate the movie
[25:34] he's if you haven't had him on by the
[25:35] way you should he's great he's so
[25:37] interesting um but he basically started
[25:40] researching climate stuff and realized
[25:42] it was nonsense and then he produced
[25:44] this movie with with a couple of other
[25:45] people about like the facts around
[25:47] climate change but I asked him because
[25:50] he's he goes down all these rabbit holes
[25:52] and I said to him have you gone down the
[25:54] Egyptian pyramid Rabbit Hill and he said
[25:56] no I haven't so I was like I'm going to
[25:57] send you a load of stuff um but it's
[26:00] interesting because the pyramids they've
[26:02] never found any tombs in the pyramid so
[26:04] they've never found any mummies any Toms
[26:06] or any kind of um uh Trinkets and stuff
[26:10] like they have in the valley is it the
[26:11] Valley of the Kings um and so there's a
[26:13] theory that those pyramids are actually
[26:16] energy producing mechanisms so they
[26:20] harness energy from the atmosphere um
[26:22] and I've seen lots of like posts about
[26:24] this and watched a few like YouTube
[26:26] videos and things like that but you do
[26:27] have to Wonder um because I remember
[26:30] reading when I was very young a book by
[26:32] Graham Hancock and he was talking about
[26:34] the pyramids and saying about how you
[26:36] know they say that they're like I don't
[26:37] know whatever it is four 5 thousand
[26:39] years old but actually they've got water
[26:42] damage on their base which could only
[26:44] have been created um during the last ice
[26:47] age so what what geologists say is well
[26:51] they can't they have to be older than
[26:53] the last ice age but what egyptologists
[26:55] will tell you is that they're like four
[26:57] or 5,000 years old which which they
[26:58] couldn't be um like it wouldn't have
[27:00] been possible for that water damage to
[27:02] be created so the question then is why
[27:04] would you go and build something like
[27:05] that and what was its purpose um and I
[27:08] always find it somewhat ridiculous when
[27:09] people talk about um sorry we're going
[27:11] way off the topic of Bitcoin here but I
[27:13] find it ridiculous when people talk
[27:15] about things like Stonehenge and they'll
[27:17] go oh that was a religious site where
[27:21] people woried and I'm like why do you
[27:23] always assume that every structure
[27:26] that's ancient has a religious
[27:27] connotation it' be like I don't know
[27:29] future people turning up at I don't know
[27:32] the Hoover Dam and saying yeah that was
[27:35] a place of worship where people
[27:37] worshiped water or you know I don't know
[27:39] even going into a modern art gallery and
[27:41] being like oh this was a place of
[27:42] worship no it wasn't you know we went to
[27:44] look at like cute things you know so I
[27:47] just I feel like we often have this kind
[27:48] of silly notion of History where we just
[27:51] imagine that people are these like super
[27:54] religious ritualistic people and that
[27:56] everything they built is is somehow has
[27:57] a religious purpose and nothing else so
[28:01] yeah I think we've forgotten a lot of
[28:02] our history and and maybe don't really
[28:04] know why those structures are there what
[28:06] they're
[28:07] for I also think we uh think of
[28:10] ourselves as uh way more advanced uh
[28:13] than than the past even though we might
[28:17] not be that much more advanced in the
[28:19] past depending on on on on how far
[28:21] you're going by the way are scheduled
[28:23] already with Tom Nelson so he will be on
[28:25] quite soon uh not not that long I think
[28:29] like I don't know the exact date but
[28:30] like I think one around one month he
[28:32] will be on uh like what is the
[28:36] conspiracy around pyramids I never heard
[28:38] up that well the conspiracy is that
[28:40] they're not actually tombs of pharaohs
[28:43] that they were just appropriated by the
[28:45] Pharaoh generation if you like um you
[28:47] know during that time but they weren't
[28:49] actually built by by those dynasties so
[28:51] that's that's kind of the conspiracy
[28:53] theory about them that they're um you
[28:55] know they have a completely different
[28:57] purpose and it's related to that
[29:00] particular dynastic people that we
[29:04] know
[29:06] interesting never heard it's a good
[29:08] rabbit
[29:09] hole I I I I will I will see if if I can
[29:13] get down
[29:14] there what do you think is the the main
[29:17] barrier for for Bitcoin to overcome to
[29:19] come to that Bitcoin world to come to
[29:21] like a mass adoption you said before
[29:23] like the UI is is a big one do you see
[29:26] anything else that you're like uh that's
[29:28] a main barrier that we have to
[29:30] overcoming Bitcoin gosh I think far too
[29:32] few people realize why they need it at
[29:35] this stage and I'm trying to think
[29:37] really why it resonated with me so much
[29:40] I think people don't realize how bad the
[29:42] monetary system is so I think for most
[29:44] people they kind of see the very
[29:46] superficial stuff like I go to the
[29:47] grocery store and it costs more and then
[29:50] they listen to a politician and the
[29:51] politician will talk about well yeah
[29:53] it's because of covid or it's because of
[29:55] like the war in Ukraine like there'll be
[29:57] a million one excuses for it um and so
[30:00] they don't really delve into it and they
[30:02] just accept that explanation at face
[30:04] value much like I did about inflation 20
[30:07] years ago I was like oh okay that's the
[30:08] reason why it doesn't make sense but
[30:10] okay you're the expert I guess if you
[30:12] say so I'll I'll take it a face value
[30:15] and so I don't think they realize um the
[30:19] kind of cataclysmic monetary train crash
[30:22] that's about to happen um I think they
[30:24] just don't get it they don't understand
[30:26] what's happening and and what's about to
[30:28] kind of fall apart so you know they
[30:31] don't understand I mean for example even
[30:33] people in finance to to give you an
[30:35] example during the lockdowns I remember
[30:36] chatting to a colleague and we were
[30:37] talking about the fact that the US
[30:39] government was printing so much money to
[30:41] fund lockdowns you know at the time I'm
[30:43] working in a bank and so we're sort of
[30:44] talking about it amongst ourselves and
[30:46] going you know what impact would that
[30:48] have and you know one of my colleagues
[30:49] that worked in research so bear in mind
[30:51] she's got like an actual research qualif
[30:55] like a CPA qualification or whatever um
[30:58] um what's it called that you do for res
[31:00] oh my God it's been such a long time now
[31:01] I've forgotten
[31:04] um there's like a formal qualification
[31:06] that you have to do to actually be like
[31:07] a a portfolio manager and a
[31:09] researcher and she was saying to me yeah
[31:11] you know but I was attending a session
[31:13] the other day and they were saying I was
[31:15] listening to an economist and he was
[31:16] saying the US government can print all
[31:19] the money it needs so it doesn't really
[31:20] matter like we're never going to go
[31:22] bankrupt because we can just print money
[31:23] and and pay ourselves off and with a
[31:25] reserve currency so it's fine um and
[31:29] that was kind of it and I was like hm
[31:31] okay that's interesting and you don't
[31:33] think about what the consequences will
[31:35] be because nobody explains to you well
[31:37] yeah but if you keep printing all this
[31:39] money the system's going to be a wash
[31:40] with money and everything's going to go
[31:43] up in price you just don't think about
[31:45] those consequences because it's on such
[31:47] a big scale it's like a geopolitical
[31:49] scale and so my the unfortunate thing is
[31:52] I think a lot of people will discover
[31:55] that they need to adopt Bitcoin and will
[31:57] get Mass adoption when it's pretty late
[31:59] for everybody and I don't mean late as
[32:01] in I think you can get on the Bitcoin
[32:03] bandwagon at any point and it's you know
[32:05] as Michael sailor says it's going up
[32:07] forever
[32:08] Laura you know so I I don't think that
[32:12] um you know I think you will benefit
[32:14] regardless of when you become a
[32:16] bitcoiner but I don't think people
[32:18] realize at this stage how critical it is
[32:20] for them to just hold a little bit like
[32:22] they don't have to hold a lot it can be
[32:24] $100 um but how critical that actually
[32:27] is to you know buttress themselves
[32:29] against against the economic crash
[32:31] that's coming so unfortunately I think
[32:33] Mass adoption will probably happen out
[32:35] of necessity rather than out of uh
[32:37] desire or some ideological reason if you
[32:41] watch my podcast already for more than
[32:43] two times you know how extremely
[32:45] passionate I am about self- custody and
[32:48] the first very very very important step
[32:51] to self- custody is always getting
[32:54] yourself a hardware wallet and I have
[32:57] one for you here this is the Bitcoin
[32:59] only Edition from the bitbox my favorite
[33:02] single signature Hardware wallet on the
[33:05] market another really important piece of
[33:08] self- custody if you have a hardware
[33:10] wallet is the backup of the seat phrase
[33:13] and bitbox made the perfect solution to
[33:16] back up your seat phrase they made a
[33:18] reusable steel wallet check out that
[33:22] beauty it's durable and extremely heavy
[33:25] if I put it on the desk I seriously fear
[33:28] for my own table it's so so heavy and
[33:31] durable I love it this is where my seed
[33:34] phrase is secure go to bitbox
[33:38] Doss robobin to get your bitbox and if
[33:42] you use code Robin you even get 5% off
[33:46] of your complete order and the next step
[33:49] is to really level up your sovereignty
[33:51] as an individual you have to have the
[33:53] most secure self custody setup you have
[33:56] to secure your own devices you have to
[33:59] protect your privacy you have to set up
[34:02] an inheritance plan and depending on
[34:05] where you live you even want to have a
[34:07] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[34:10] in case something goes really really
[34:12] wrong and through all those steps the
[34:14] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[34:17] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[34:19] way.com
[34:20] Partners SL robobin you even get a 30
[34:24] minute free call to find out how you can

[34:29] not least I have something completely
[34:32] new for you guys I partnered up with
[34:35] coin vigilante this is the most
[34:38] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[34:41] saw created by anyone look at that
[34:43] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[34:46] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[34:49] the perfect subtle elegant way to go out
[34:52] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[34:55] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[34:59] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[35:01] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[35:05] watch collections you have the date of
[35:07] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[35:11] there and of course also the block
[35:13] height and which EPO we are currently in
[35:16] I love the level of detail they put in
[35:19] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[35:22] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[35:24] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[35:27] love those watches so so much yeah it's
[35:31] it's it comes down to the that the pain
[35:33] is not big enough and they don't see
[35:35] that the train is crashing and they
[35:36] could now get out but uh they're like ah
[35:39] let's let's let's sit in the train chair
[35:41] and let's let's let's let's ride along
[35:43] so I also like to ask actually um normis
[35:47] that don't get it or they they are not
[35:49] in the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole yet they like
[35:52] when I ask them okay the the governments
[35:54] have so much St uh where is the money
[35:57] coming from
[35:58] uh what do you think this this will do
[36:00] what do you think of inflation like I I
[36:02] usually tackle the the Bitcoin education
[36:05] before with uh some General Financial
[36:09] education and even like Financial people
[36:11] as you said they they into that deep and
[36:14] they're like yeah the US can never
[36:17] default because they can always print
[36:19] money because they're the reserve
[36:20] currency but what if they stop being the
[36:22] reserve currency what if Bitcoin all of
[36:24] the sudden is the reserve currency then
[36:26] then they still can print money nobody
[36:29] will accept it for any real world good
[36:31] so uh it's there's a lot a big blind
[36:34] spot for for for the world I I feel like
[36:37] that yeah and I think all of us I mean
[36:39] we have sort of you know short shortish
[36:41] lives right so we don't really
[36:43] appreciate like what's come before many
[36:45] people don't really study history and
[36:47] much of History I've also realized is
[36:49]  like it's it's you get taught
[36:51] this very kind of narrow sorry am I loud
[36:53] to swear
[36:57] that bit out but um it's h you know it's
[37:00] talk like in a very narrow way so you
[37:02] learn the sort of prescribed things that
[37:04] you're allowed to talk about there's
[37:05] like an Overton window of like this is
[37:07] where the discussion is allowed to
[37:09] happen and you can argue within this
[37:11] window but you're not allowed to argue
[37:12] outside of it and so I think that's part
[37:14] of the problem is people don't really
[37:16] see see the kind of historical thing
[37:18] where every single fiat currency has
[37:20] eventually collapsed every single one
[37:22] like there's not one in the history I
[37:23] think the British pound is the longest
[37:25] running one um and that's trending to
[37:27] collapse anyway with uh a lot of help
[37:30] from the British government um so I
[37:32] think that's part of the reason and the
[37:34] other thing as well is I think there is
[37:35] actually a concerted effort to mislead
[37:37] people I mean you were saying about
[37:38] talking to normies about things that
[37:40] they can relate to like inflation and
[37:43] you know that kind of stuff and I'm kind
[37:45] of like sure but for example you know I
[37:48] have people neighbors that talk to me
[37:50] about how everything's getting so
[37:52] expensive and it's the Boomer's fault
[37:56] because they're all sit on these piles
[37:58] of wealth and these big houses that they
[38:01] refuse to sell and that's the reason why
[38:03] housing is becoming so expensive for
[38:05] everyone else because the boomers are
[38:06] sitting in their houses and not selling
[38:08] them and I'm like okay like the houses
[38:12] are not becoming more valuable the money
[38:14] is becoming less valuable so the boomers
[38:16] are not sitting on an expensive house if
[38:18] they sell that house they can only buy
[38:21] the same house like same value of house
[38:24] or same kind of house with that money
[38:26] it's not like they suddenly can afford
[38:27] something better than what they had and
[38:30] why should somebody who's lived in their
[38:31] house for 40 50 years sell it because
[38:35] you know I don't know the the what you
[38:36] call it the property taxes go up so high
[38:38] that they don't actually have the cash
[38:40] flow to pay for it I mean it's just so
[38:42] fundamentally moral and I hear this
[38:44] everywhere and I even saw quite a
[38:46] well-known Bitcoin I forget who it was
[38:48] the other day wrote a whole thread about
[38:50] you know basically bashing Boomers for
[38:53] sitting on piles of cash and being lazy
[38:56] and enjoying life and I'm like well
[38:57] these are people that kind of were born
[38:59] during the war or lived during the war
[39:01] you know they had a really hard time
[39:03] they didn't have nice things and now
[39:06] they've kind of worked and saved all
[39:07] their life I think it's kind of okay if
[39:08] they want to go on a cruise every now
[39:10] and then and live in their nice house
[39:11] that they've spent years you know
[39:14] maintaining and decorating and
[39:16] everything so yeah I think there's a lot
[39:17] of this stuff you get told these
[39:19] narratives that are not true and if you
[39:20] don't know how these things work you
[39:22] just accept them at face
[39:23] value and it's also interesting because
[39:26] I can imagine
[39:27] Bitcoin as being one day at that very
[39:30] position where because they saved so
[39:33] early in Bitcoin and they actually cared
[39:36] for their Bitcoin and they had it
[39:37] improper self- custody didn't lose
[39:39] anything uh because they could then
[39:41] actually be the those Boomers who have a
[39:43] lot of Bitcoin and just like live off
[39:45] like 1% of their stack every year and
[39:48] can live basically forever uh for free
[39:51] um they they they could be the same so
[39:54] like interesting do do you see um
[39:56] Bitcoin kind after like the the the the
[39:59] new real estate the new uh opportunity
[40:02] is as it was before for Real Estate not
[40:05] really because I think with real estate
[40:06] it was about making money and the yield
[40:08] is coming from somewhere if that makes
[40:10] sense so you know the it's like where's
[40:15] the yield coming from I mean you know
[40:17] the yield is basically coming from you
[40:19] know the the printing of the money so
[40:21] you're sitting on an asset you can then
[40:22] rent out the asset you can sell it for
[40:24] more money later on and you know that
[40:27] you you're basically a cantillon Aire
[40:29] essentially um whereas with Bitcoin I
[40:31] don't think it's the same structure so I
[40:33] think when
[40:35] people gosh I mean I guess what if
[40:36] people become extremely wealthy through
[40:38] Bitcoin I mean it's not because they're
[40:40] necessarily taking anything away from
[40:41] anyone else although actually you could
[40:43] argue that it is it is due to the fact
[40:45] that the money is being devalued the
[40:46] whole time so the Bitcoin becomes more
[40:48] valuable but it's not a utility in the
[40:51] way that a house is a utility and I
[40:52] think that's that's my issue morally
[40:54] with real estate and profiting of real
[40:57] estate is that you know it's a utility
[40:59] you need a house to live in so if that
[41:02] becomes um too expensive for you to buy
[41:05] there's a there's a moral issue there if
[41:07] Bitcoin becomes too expensive for you to
[41:09] buy oh W like you might not be a
[41:11] billionaire but you're still probably
[41:12] going to be able to buy food and and
[41:13] have a house and live and whatever you
[41:16] know it's not it's not kind of taking
[41:17] anything away from from people in that
[41:20] sense of something that's a utility so
[41:21] yeah I think it's a very different thing
[41:23] gosh it's really hard to it's really
[41:24] hard to Define Bitcoin when you start
[41:26] trying to define it can go down a 100
[41:28] different rabbit holes I mean what is it
[41:29] I mean I think of it as being money I
[41:31] guess primarily um I think of it as
[41:34] being a commodity so it's something that
[41:36] you store it has value but I also think
[41:39] of it as being a network I often think
[41:41] of Bitcoin as being this thing that you
[41:43] know we can create a historical record
[41:45] of what will happen I think I was
[41:47] talking to Tom about this as well and I
[41:49] was saying you know we hear so much now
[41:51] about history being Rewritten and things
[41:53] on the internet being deleted and
[41:56] history kind of being scrubbed and
[41:57] that's happened throughout history I
[41:59] mean people have burnt books for as long
[42:01] as books have
[42:02] existed and I look at Bitcoin and I
[42:04] think I know this is a bit controversial
[42:06] with the whole ordinal stuff and you
[42:08] know creating CH blockchain bloat but I
[42:11] do look at it as a Time chain it's
[42:12] somewhere where you can record history
[42:14] in a way that it can't ever be erased
[42:16] and I think that is actually one of the
[42:18] more fascinating use cases is actually
[42:20] being able to store knowledge in there
[42:22] such that we can pass that down and you
[42:24] know maybe in 20,000 years people don't
[42:26] have to wonder about the pyramids
[42:28] they'll have a record where they can go
[42:29] back and see exactly what it was and who
[42:32] did
[42:33] what don't trust
[42:36] verify that that's a really interesting
[42:39] thing I I I had oh gosh I forgot his
[42:42] name uh the guy who did in Guatemala I
[42:47] think it was the election on bitcoin the
[42:49] blockchain and he tries to do it also in
[42:52] in in other countries I forgot his name
[42:54] right now but it's it's really
[42:55] interesting I mean you have have the
[42:58] always the origin problem the Oracle
[43:00] problem where like okay who puts the
[43:02] data on the blockchain who puts the the
[43:04] things on on bitcoin but yeah of course
[43:06] once it's there you can verify that the
[43:08] that the document was there uh on that
[43:12] time and I think the the concept of time
[43:15] chain is an really underestimated one
[43:18] because all of the sudden we can
[43:19] actually pinpoint uh something and I
[43:24] weird personal example of that uh I made
[43:27] pottery with my girlfriend where we like
[43:29] uh painted the pottery and and stuff
[43:31] like that uh
[43:35] going not going too deep into why and
[43:38] everything like that but basically um
[43:41] she went ahead and she actually put the
[43:45] date in there like 11th of September
[43:48] like all those things uh and I just
[43:51] wrote the block block height in there
[43:54] because I was like the block heide is uh
[43:57] the best way to see when it actually was
[44:01] there is the time in there the date in
[44:03] there the time zone because if you write
[44:06] that you don't know which time zone that
[44:08] was in uh if you just write the date and
[44:11] it's it is to to um 10 or 50 or like
[44:16] it's it's not you can really see like
[44:18] what was that time frame in like maybe
[44:21] the time frame was 5 minutes or 10
[44:23] minutes or 15 minutes because the block
[44:25] could be longer like could even be like
[44:28] one hour long that block time of that
[44:30] but it is very specific to a certain
[44:33] time and you just have to write six
[44:36] numbers and then you're ah there you go
[44:38] you know where it is and that's a that's
[44:40] an amazing uh amazing way to do that so
[44:43] I just brought that example up because
[44:45] it was think I think people have a baby
[44:47] and they put like block height born
[44:49] block height and I'm like oh that's so
[44:51] sweet yeah I even saw like marriage
[44:54] rings where they on the back they wrote
[44:56] The Block heide yeah yes very nice
[44:59] sometimes sometimes they write on on the
[45:01] back the the start starting of like when
[45:03] when the marriage actually was uh and
[45:06] it's it's kind of if you really want to
[45:08] have all the information on there the
[45:09] Block C is probably the the most
[45:12] minimalistic way to get it on there
[45:15] because time zone and everything like
[45:17] that putting on there that's that's a
[45:19] major
[45:20] thing yeah there's another conspiracy
[45:23] theory that we we don't actually know
[45:25] what time we're living in that some of
[45:26] our history is being erased and the Dark
[45:29] Ages the so-called Dark Ages were not
[45:31] the Dark Ages and actually like we don't
[45:32] know even know what year we're in right
[45:34] now which is kind of interesting because
[45:36] I'm like yeah it's funny isn't it I mean
[45:38] like I I quite like holding Traditions
[45:40] like things like making a big deal about
[45:41] celebrating Christmas and things like
[45:43] that and my husband will say things like
[45:45] oh yeah but it's just a a random day you
[45:49] know in SpaceTime like you're just
[45:51] randomly selecting it for no particular
[45:53] reason and it's like when you go oh a
[45:54] year has passed what's a year it's just
[45:57] some subjective you know kind of time
[46:00] frame that we have and I suppose it
[46:01] follows the seasons but you know it is
[46:03] subjective and you kind of think yeah is
[46:05] and how do we even know what the actual
[46:07] dates are we don't really I don't know I
[46:10] mean if you go back far enough who can
[46:12] tell and and and everything is uh human
[46:16] M like the all the systems at some point
[46:19] someone thought about it and just like
[46:21] defined it it's not like uh nature was
[46:24] like oh like yeah the days and and and
[46:26] years of of course there's like we we
[46:29] try to put that whole thing in like to
[46:32] the seasons on the day of the of the of
[46:35] the time and and of the time of the day
[46:37] and all the things like it it it makes
[46:39] kind of sense uh but uh yeah we we could
[46:43] also divide the day in like 60 pieces
[46:46] and not 24 pieces like there could be
[46:48] other pieces but I I'm not too deep in
[46:52] that topic but yeah I think it's it's
[46:53] very random uh to put a lot of meaning
[46:57] do like one specific day because it's
[46:59] just not a random day yeah and you've
[47:01] got like the Mayan calendar you've got
[47:02] the Gregorian calendar like New Year's
[47:04] is celebrated differently in Asian
[47:06] countries versus Western countries I
[47:07] mean none of it's the same it's all very
[47:09] subjective so you're right if you had a
[47:11] block height we can all agree that this
[47:13] thing happened in a specific Moment In
[47:15] Time absolutely absolutely um what's
[47:18] your opinion on the on the lightning
[47:19] Network how important do you think that
[47:22] uh second layer uh is for for Bitcoin I
[47:25] think it's unbelievable ly important um
[47:29] I get really annoyed when people say
[47:30] that Bitcoin doesn't scale because I
[47:31] know the lightning work network has some
[47:33] issues but it does scale and people are
[47:34] using it every day to buy everything
[47:36] from coffee to books to holidays to
[47:39] everything so it's already a payment
[47:41] system um and it's certainly much more
[47:43] effective than like the Fiat system so I
[47:46] don't know if you know sinot um they're
[47:48] a company that's based out the us but
[47:50] they basically have created this system
[47:53] where you can pay your electricity bill
[47:55] with through the lightning net Network
[47:57] at the point of usage so you put the you
[48:00] put it behind the meter basically so
[48:01] that every time you're using electricity
[48:03] you're paying for it immediately and
[48:05] energy companies love this because they
[48:07] don't have to wait three months to get
[48:09] paid which means you're not a risky
[48:11] customer to them which means in theory
[48:13] that can start allow them to start
[48:14] lowering the rates that they
[48:17] charge um but it's incredible when you
[48:20] think about it because you have this
[48:21] like realtime payment system and one of
[48:23] the co-founders came and did so I ran a
[48:26] I ran a female found a training program
[48:27] last year which was basically to teach
[48:30] women who were running businesses about
[48:31] how to incorporate Bitcoin and Lisa who
[48:34] is one of the co-founders of sinot came
[48:36] and did a presentation on the payment
[48:38] system so she came and talked about what
[48:40] sinot was doing but she prefaced it with
[48:43] a whole kind of backstory of how the
[48:45] global payment networks work and she's
[48:47] got a lot of expertise in this area and
[48:50] I think most people don't know how
[48:51] payments work I mean it's insane they're
[48:53] so complicated it's ridiculous like the
[48:55] Swift system is unbelievably inefficient
[48:58] now you've got situations where Russia's
[48:59] obviously come off of Swift because they
[49:01] got kicked off um you know when they
[49:03] after they invaded Ukraine and so all of
[49:06] these systems are just not functional
[49:08] and countries are starting to say well
[49:10] we don't want to use them like the
[49:11] bricks countries are saying well
[49:12] actually we're going to establish our
[49:13] own Reserve currency like a bricks
[49:16] currency and we're going to have our own
[49:17] payments Network because we don't want
[49:19] to deal with this kind of us you know uh
[49:23] kind of bully bully sort of state that
[49:25] wants to control you know our access to
[49:27] the monetary system so I think there's a
[49:30] shift anyway away from the current
[49:33] payment networks which don't really work
[49:35] very well at all and are centrally
[49:37] controlled um and become very political
[49:40] to A system that is completely
[49:42] apolitical that anybody can join where
[49:45] anybody can transact so I think that the
[49:46] lightning network is going to be really
[49:48] important unless it gets replaced by
[49:50] something better um which is possible
[49:53] but I think for what we have now it's
[49:55] the most effective system for doing
[49:57] payments um and then there's the whole
[49:59] use case as well obviously about just
[50:01] like content creation um so I use
[50:04] substack to run my community and I
[50:06] subscribe to lots of substack writers
[50:08] but it's annoying when you have to pay a
[50:10] subscription to somebody's entire kind
[50:12] of uh content when maybe you read one
[50:15] article that they put out a month but if
[50:18] they adopted the lightning Network which
[50:19] I strongly substack listening they
[50:21] should adopt it um you know you could
[50:24] literally just pay at the point of
[50:25] reading so you just go you open an
[50:27] article if you want to read it you just
[50:29] click a button you make a lightning
[50:30] payment you get to read it same thing
[50:32] with consuming any media you if you want
[50:35] to put stuff on YouTube like a movie and
[50:36] you want people to pay for it you don't
[50:38] have to go through all the faf of
[50:39] putting in your credit card your name
[50:41] your address now all that stuff's on a
[50:43] database and it's a honey pot for
[50:44] someone to steal and you know
[50:46] appropriate your identity no you just do
[50:48] a lightning payment bam done you pay for
[50:50] that one piece of content and it's
[50:52] seamless and to anyone who's used the
[50:54] lightning Network it's EX exponentially
[50:57] easier than using a credit card like
[50:59] exponentially easier much quicker much
[51:01] more efficient
[51:02] instant um so yeah I think it's
[51:04] incredible kudos to to the people who
[51:07] invented
[51:08] it they did a great job um do you think
[51:11] it could as you said like disrupt the
[51:14] the subscription model because we can
[51:16] all of the sudden pay on the minute or
[51:18] on the second that we actually consume
[51:21] the things God I hope so yeah I really
[51:24] hope so I mean I think we're early
[51:26] because a lot of the technology is hard
[51:28] to integrate so I don't know if you know
[51:29] Justin um what's his name Justin Hilton
[51:32] who is the founder of shocket so he went
[51:34] through the wolf accelerator program and
[51:36] he's basically built like a YouTube but
[51:38] uh a kind of lightning enabled YouTube
[51:41] with exactly that where it has a
[51:42] lightning pay wall but you know if you
[51:44] talk to him about the technicalities of
[51:46] running that and setting it up we're not
[51:48] quite there yet in terms of having this
[51:50] Uber seamless technology for it but I
[51:53] think as we slowly get there it's going
[51:55] to become more and more of a thing
[51:57] because it also forces content creators
[51:59] to you know really create good content
[52:01] you can't just you know write a couple
[52:05] of good articles a month and then have
[52:06] the rest of the stuff be rubbish and
[52:07] then expect people to pay for the whole
[52:09] thing so you know we've gone so much to
[52:12] a subscription model with software and
[52:14] it's a pain because do you remember the
[52:15] days I don't know if you're old enough
[52:16] to remember but you'd get a little disc
[52:18] and you'd come home and you put it in
[52:19] your
[52:20] computer you'd actually own the damn
[52:22] software and now it's like you have to
[52:23] rent it which is really annoying and it
[52:26] gets upgraded all the time and you don't
[52:27] like the upgrade you want the old
[52:29] version so you know I just think if
[52:31] we're going to be in that subscription
[52:32] model then it should be on a usage basis
[52:36] and not on a on a kind of a download uh
[52:39] basis or sorry subscription basis I'm
[52:43] kind of old enough but it was like
[52:45] beginning of the days it was very
[52:46] shortterm here so I had some CDs and
[52:49] DVDs so like I I I get that world but uh
[52:52] I'm I'm not long in there it's also like
[52:54] one of the things like I I like canine I
[52:57] love Riverside I love all those great
[52:59] online tools but it's annoying if they
[53:02] change the whole ux every two three
[53:04] months and I'm like where is that one
[53:06] feature that I really need for that
[53:08] podcast where's this one feature where I
[53:10] really need for that picture to look
[53:11] like in the fun that it always looks
[53:14] like in the one side it's great that
[53:16] they innovate great that they bring new
[53:17] features but then they hide things or
[53:20] it's different like with Riverside I
[53:21] struggle a lot because they uh do a lot
[53:25] of innovating and they doing a lot of
[53:27] great stuff and fancy things which uh
[53:30] helps me also a lot but then I have to
[53:32] write them like how can I do that now
[53:35] like I did this all the time if that one
[53:37] button noted button is not there anymore
[53:40] is there another way to do the same
[53:42] thing because otherwise I can have to
[53:43] completely change my workflow so like uh
[53:46] it's it's great and and it's good and
[53:48] bad at the same time but I like the idea
[53:51] of you paying for something when I'm
[53:54] using it so that's uh I'm I'm I really
[53:57] love that that idea and you brought it
[53:59] up and even makoni also brought it up to
[54:02] me who was on the on the podcast really
[54:04] really cool and one last question um oh
[54:07] sorry you wanted to say something about
[54:08] it no I was just goingon to say if you
[54:10] combine that with nosta then I mean
[54:11] which which you know zaps I mean now you
[54:13] just have like this perfect perfect kind
[54:16] of platform of censorship free mostly
[54:20] sens censorship free you know
[54:22] communication and the ability to just
[54:24] pay people directly I think the only
[54:25] thing we've got now really is just I'll
[54:28] be honest just the parasitic Regulatory
[54:30] and government structure that sits above
[54:32] it because it's like oh you've got a
[54:33] file taxes or you've got to pay Capital
[54:35] Gains you've got to I mean all of that
[54:37] stuff is just it has become a complete
[54:40] uh just complete barrier to Innovation
[54:42] and to progress and I think we just need
[54:44] to get rid of all of
[54:46] that you know get rid of all of it trade
[54:49] should just be free taxation shouldn't
[54:51] happen if you're doing business with
[54:52] people you shouldn't be taxed on it I'm
[54:54] happy to pay for things like roads and
[54:56] you know sewer networks and things like
[54:58] that but government should be service
[55:00] providers and the tax should be
[55:03] literally limited to what services are
[55:05] you providing for me and how well are
[55:07] you doing it like when's the trash
[55:08] getting collected are the streets being
[55:10] swept you know all all of that kind of
[55:12] stuff fine everything else that falls
[55:14] outside of it just needs to be taken off
[55:15] of their remit it's um and if we have to
[55:19] legislate to say they cannot ever do it
[55:21] then that's what we'll have to do but
[55:23] it's just yeah I mean it's ridiculous do
[55:25] you think that bcoin will bring that
[55:28] future bring that service based
[55:30] government it's either that or we're
[55:32] living in a digital pan optican slavery
[55:34] I think we're at a Crossroads now where
[55:36] it's like you know which
[55:38] way um but yes I mean I think that
[55:41] absolutely would I just think I think
[55:42] what I notice generally I mean not to go
[55:44] too into politics but I just noticed
[55:46] that governments are becoming
[55:47] increasingly less relevant as a benefit
[55:50] like they're providing no benefit and
[55:52] they're actually causing more problems
[55:54] than they're they're solving and I just
[55:56] see this over my lifetime increasing
[55:58] exponentially I mean it's getting to the
[56:00] point where it's just like the whole
[56:02] bureaucratic structure is just pointless
[56:05] I don't even know why these people exist
[56:07] so yeah I think Bitcoin will take us
[56:10] there that's the
[56:12] hope that's the hope and the the other
[56:15] way is cbdcs and suffering and War and
[56:18] and complete uh digital control uh and
[56:21] and and I really hope that we we have
[56:24] that Bitcoin world where we live in in
[56:27] in peace and prosperity and and we have
[56:29] individual rights and we have Pro uh the
[56:32] the the individual and the human being
[56:34] is on the highest front and not like the
[56:37] collectivist stuff and the cbdc stuff I
[56:40] think that's that's the that's the thing
[56:42] that we we have have to choose do you
[56:45] think it's important to get into
[56:46] Politics as as a bitcoiner or will will
[56:49] that thing sort out
[56:50] anyways it's a hard thing to say really
[56:53] because it depends on what level you're
[56:54] looking at these things I think if
[56:55] you're looking at these things
[56:56] energetically then giving your energy to
[56:59] it allows it to grow like whatever you
[57:01] focus on grows um so if you sort of
[57:04] ascribe to this kind of spiritual view
[57:06] of the world then probably focusing on
[57:08] what's going on in politics is not ideal
[57:11] um the only thing I would say is that
[57:12] you might not care about politics but
[57:14] politics cares about you you know so
[57:15] it's like saying I don't care about
[57:17] government well you still have to pay
[57:19] your taxes you know you still get
[57:20] arrested if you break some law that
[57:22] they've invented unfortunately I had to
[57:24] restart the podcast with CHR two times
[57:27] this was now the second time we had to
[57:28] restart and unfortunately the overo to
[57:32] the next part was not as good as it
[57:35] should be so I wanted to just give you
[57:37] that as a context so you understand what
[57:40] we will talking about in the next few
[57:42] minutes because we talking about uh
[57:44] Riverside breaking and all those things
[57:46] and also some interesting talks with
[57:48] Jeff poof and I really wanted to let
[57:50] them in the podcast because I think
[57:52] that's kind of interesting uh and don't
[57:54] just cut them out so
[57:57] I hope this gives you context and by the
[57:58] way I also saw one thing um I saw that
[58:01] only a third of my regular listeners
[58:05] those people who listen to more than
[58:08] just one video that come back to listen
[58:11] again and again to a video only a third
[58:13] of those people are actually subscribed
[58:16] so this tells me two things first of all
[58:18] only 33% are actually subscrib to my
[58:20] channel who are actually enjoying the
[58:22] channel uh long term and that we could
[58:25] actually already be at 30,000
[58:28] subscribers that is amazing on YouTube
[58:30] so F first of all thank you so much for
[58:32] supporting me and if you could do me now
[58:34] the favor of just hitting the Subscribe
[58:36] button if you haven't done already uh
[58:39] that would mean the world to me and it
[58:40] also really boosts the channel so thank
[58:43] you so much and now enjoy the last part
[58:46] with Christa then uh then I will collect
[58:49] the free files and put it together
[58:52] somehow no worries I had it with uh
[58:56] I had a d actually with Jeff Bo and this
[58:58] was really funny we recorded with Jeff
[59:00] Bo and he was talking about the free
[59:02] market and then he used as an example
[59:06] Riverside and literally while he was
[59:08] talking about Riverside Riverside was
[59:10] failing and cutting out and we had to
[59:13] restart
[59:14] them he's so amazing I could listen to
[59:17] his podcast forever it's funny because
[59:18] everybody keeps saying they want uh
[59:20] Michael saor to go on Joe Rogan and I'm
[59:22] like I would so much prefer to have Jeff
[59:24] Booth on I just think it you know
[59:27] everyone's really into Michael saor but
[59:28] he talks about things I feel like from a
[59:30] very economic standpoint I feel like
[59:31] with Jeff Booth he almost takes it like
[59:33] a level higher you know it's really just
[59:37] outside of the realm of like what we
[59:38] really conceive I don't know I just find
[59:40] his his um his stuff like almost
[59:43] spiritual in some
[59:45] ways I think what Michael sailor has
[59:48] going for him is that he is like
[59:51] obviously he's really good in speaking
[59:53] and making metaphors and making
[59:54] comparisons to things like he is really
[59:56] good in saying the one thing buy Bitcoin
[59:59] now in so many different ways and
[60:02] compared to his like he's really good in
[60:04] that but context also really matters
[60:07] because he's a really successful uh long
[60:10] served publicly traded CEO no no longer
[60:13] now because now he's only the chairman
[60:15] and like for me it's context is really
[60:18] important because if if uh some random
[60:21] guy that is just like one week or two
[60:23] week on Twitter um says like oh like I I
[60:27] love to go and and play chess on on
[60:30] on the toilet that will probably not get
[60:33] a lot of Fus and a lot of excitement and
[60:36] a lot of interesting comments but if the
[60:38] same thing chogan tweets or IL musk
[60:42] tweets or like Michael S tweets that
[60:44] gets a lot of attention and I think
[60:47] Michael S is just like this has this
[60:49] kind of Pop level uh status um where the
[60:54] context as him as a person plays a lot
[60:56] in the role and then he also speaks
[60:58] really good uh and even though there
[61:01] might be better speakers and might be
[61:03] better metaphors might be better few in
[61:05] it the context is so important on a on a
[61:08] person uh that people really love
[61:11] Michael saor and I mean he was for me
[61:14] also the one that orange peed me Michael
[61:15] saor so for me was also really profound
[61:18] the interview of him but I agree like
[61:20] the the context matters and I think
[61:22] that's why people really want him to be
[61:24] on show but they should both be on
[61:27] chogan chogan should open his eyes and
[61:29] and and maybe get like five bitcoiners
[61:31] on I was astounded by the way did you
[61:33] know that uh what's his name Andrea
[61:36] soplos was on Joe Rogan years ago yeah
[61:39] yeah that's that's a lot of people don't
[61:40] know that and and it was like years
[61:43] later that Joe Rogan eventually bought
[61:45] Bitcoin and I'm like how did you have
[61:46] this guy on your show and not like
[61:50] straight up I'm just like oh my God I
[61:53] mean he's kind of gone off the radar now
[61:54] I think Andreas Antonopoulos is just
[61:56] like semi-retired or just wants to be
[61:57] left alone and doesn't want to be a
[61:59] public figure anymore but he was an
[62:00] amazing speaker absolutely amazing and I
[62:03] was just like wow it's crazy but it
[62:05] really goes to show because Joe Rogan's
[62:07] somebody that's very curious he's very
[62:08] interested in things but it just goes to
[62:11] show that you need like a lot of
[62:13] reinforcement with these things like
[62:15] repetition before they sink in like he
[62:17] only bought Bitcoin I think a year
[62:20] ago yeah and and and uh it's also
[62:23] interesting because he
[62:27] he's in a really good financial position
[62:29] so he's not in a position uh where he
[62:32] really needs Bitcoin right now like he's
[62:35] not struggling with it so he probably
[62:38] needs a lot more reminders of of that
[62:41] and he gets pitch so many ideas with
[62:43] talking with so many different people uh
[62:46] and he cannot adopt all ideas that get
[62:49] gets pitch to to him during out the
[62:51] podcast otherwise like he cannot he just
[62:54] cannot do that so that's that's that's
[62:55] an interesting thing with with
[62:57] chog but yeah like that that that kind
[63:00] of ends up our our podcast our third
[63:03] third third try of the podcast um thank
[63:07] you so much for for being on I have one
[63:09] question that I always ask each guest at
[63:11] the end of the podcast what can we learn
[63:14] from you besides all the things that we
[63:16] already talked about oh gosh my God you
[63:20] should tell me this one in advance I
[63:22] have to prepare what's to learn I'm
[63:24] going to say something probably bit
[63:26] controversial for the Maxis but I'm like
[63:27] don't don't necessarily believe or buy
[63:30] into Bitcoin entirely like do your own
[63:32] research and keep questioning it because
[63:36] I think it holds a lot of promise and
[63:38] I'm definitely seeing myself as a
[63:39] Bitcoin Maxi and I have a lot of faith
[63:41] in it as a technology but there are so
[63:44] many unknown
[63:47] unknowns that you just you shouldn't
[63:50] don't don't assume that it's the only
[63:52] thing that's going to save you you know
[63:53] don't rely on bitcoin as bitcoin's going
[63:55] to come save you I think you need to
[63:56] also think about practical things like
[63:59] rowing your boat making sure you've got
[64:00] enough food in storage making sure
[64:02] you've got you know safety plans things
[64:05] like that um you know all the usual
[64:07] things that you might do as a human to
[64:09] keep yourself alive and progress
[64:10] spiritually or whatever it is that you
[64:12] feel that you're here to do don't think
[64:14] that bitcoin's necessarily going to come
[64:15] to save you so I think that would
[64:17] probably be my advice um I think a note
[64:21] I'd leave on is i' I'd encourage people
[64:23] maybe to consider Bitcoin as the second
[64:26] coming so which might slightly
[64:29] contradict what I've just said um but
[64:31] I've I've mused about this a lot myself
[64:34] about whether it actually is if we are
[64:36] living in a simulation is this actually
[64:38] like the second coming is actually like
[64:40] an antivirus of code that's been
[64:41] injected in so I do wonder whether
[64:44] Bitcoin has I I ascribe a lot to the
[64:46] theory that we're living in a simulation
[64:48] so I think Bitcoin might be something
[64:50] that has been put into our Matrix to fix
[64:53] a program that is going wrong
[64:56] so that that's a thought I would maybe
[64:59] leave people
[65:00] with I I love it I love it a lot um and
[65:05] uh it's it's really interesting I have
[65:07] now endrine the second question of the
[65:10] tine the the the really the last
[65:11] question of of this podcast is always
[65:13] the question where the previous guest is
[65:15] asking a question for the next guest
[65:16] without knowing who the next guest is
[65:18] and it's uh it would have already the
[65:21] the answer of you from the previous
[65:24] question already would have fitted Maybe
[65:25] find something else what's the thing
[65:28] that you most dislike about the Bitcoin
[65:30] Community I don't really dislike
[65:31] anything about the Bitcoin Community per
[65:33] say but I think I was very attracted to
[65:36] it because of the ethics of it of sound
[65:38] money and and what I saw as a more
[65:41] wholesome environment than traditional
[65:43] finance and I think it's been
[65:44] disappointing to learn over the last Mo
[65:47] mostly I'd say maybe the last year or so
[65:49] because I've maybe been a bit more
[65:51] public and interacted with people a bit
[65:53] more but there's a lot of grifters and I
[65:55] think that was quite a sad thing for me
[65:57] to realize CU it's it's the public
[65:59] perception of it and I've always been
[66:00] very anti- that and felt that that
[66:02] wasn't really representative of people
[66:04] in Bitcoin but I have come across quite
[66:07] a lot of people of late um that I would
[66:10] say would fit that Griff of things so
[66:11] I'd say that's kind of I was a little
[66:13] bit disappointed in in seeing that in
[66:15] the Bitcoin Community but you know take
[66:18] the good with the bad I guess uh
[66:21] wherever there's money there are crypts
[66:26] we cannot get rid of them but yeah
[66:28] really good Insight thank you so much uh
[66:30] chista for for being on uh for taking
[66:33] the time before I leave you uh before I
[66:36] can let
[66:37] you before I can let you go where can
[66:39] people find you where can people reach
[66:41] out to you and ask you questions um well
[66:43] so yeah I've run a Bitcoin Community for
[66:45] women access tribe obviously so you can
[66:47] find me on uh at access tribe on Twitter
[66:52] accessor tribe on uh Instagram
[66:56] and I think it's access tribe Bitcoin on
[67:00] Facebook and then if you look up on
[67:02] LinkedIn it's just under the company of
[67:03] access tribe uh I have a YouTube channel
[67:06] as well which I don't really babysit
[67:08] very much because I send my podcasts all
[67:09] out on substack but it the stuff is
[67:12] there the talks and the various uh
[67:14] podcasts so that's at
[67:16] youtube.com access tribe um and I think
[67:20] that's it that's pretty much all the
[67:21] socials and obviously the website access
[67:23] tribe.com
