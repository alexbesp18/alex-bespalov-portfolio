[00:00] because that's usually what they do
[00:01] that's what they've done with a lot of
[00:02] the people I know that are active in
[00:04] politics and are you know against
[00:07] corruption they send uh robbers to break
[00:09] in the plan is to hold a referendum uh
[00:12] on November 24th so that's what I'm
[00:14] pushing for that changes governance and
[00:17] government at the core for for the
[00:19] interest of groups uh people to get
[00:21] income and Status uh and power out of
[00:24] this spending uh so I don't believe in
[00:27] politics at all since uh ethereum got
[00:29] started it was most of the other
[00:31] blockchains or shitcoin chains that uh
[00:33] seem to be getting most of the
[00:35] developers looking for profit more than
[00:37] they were actually looking for
[00:39] technological advancement right even if
[00:41] you say you take 10 million and you use
[00:43] half a million or a million to build on
[00:45] on hadera and the rest to build on
[00:47] bitcoin it would have still had its
[00:49] restrictions money doesn't come I mean
[00:52] we know the the main problem is money
[00:55] right now right money and greed all you
[00:57] can do is is maintain your your
[00:59] principles your Integrity your
[01:02] [Music]
[01:05] values let's quickly introduce Maya and
[01:08] Rahim even though both of you were
[01:10] already on my show before but I think it
[01:12] will really be good for the story and
[01:14] and what we are trying to tell and and
[01:16] the whole story behind it so maybe we
[01:19] start with Maya um who are you and and
[01:21] what are you doing in in Bitcoin and
[01:23] what are you doing in suram hi Robin uh
[01:26] my name is Maya paru um I started the
[01:29] circular economy here in Surinam about a
[01:32] year and a half ago and about 10 months
[01:36] ago after unfailing government
[01:38] corruption I announced that I was also
[01:42] uh going to run in these elections um
[01:45] and ever since I've been doing a bit of
[01:48] both so Grassroots and top down um and
[01:52] now we're in the midst of um you know
[01:54] campaigns really are are getting off the
[01:57] ground right now start just starting
[02:00] um and elections are in about three
[02:03] months interesting I love that Rahim R
[02:07] tan I'm an Austrian Economist I came
[02:10] over from Switzerland to Surinam it's
[02:13] my's
[02:14] invitation once to get some economic
[02:16] expertise to the country uh to help
[02:19] reform it it has its development
[02:21] challenges but a lot of potential uh I'm
[02:24] one of the very few Austrian economists
[02:26] who's also a bitcoiner and an early
[02:29] Bitcoin I followed that topic for a long
[02:32] time was the first one to teach and
[02:33] write about Bitcoin and academic setting
[02:37] and uh as for Maya Bitcoin is quite an
[02:39] important part of the story uh yeah
[02:43] seemed obvious that that's kind of mat
[02:46] here really cool I love the I love the
[02:49] pairing up here um for you Maya we last
[02:53] time spoke uh uh in in the podcast in
[02:56] the middle of the podcast where we
[02:58] talked about the the corruption and the
[03:00] examples that you gave us in the middle
[03:02] all of the sudden the internet broke
[03:04] down uh and I think we we we kind of
[03:07] maybe can connect there I think the
[03:09] podcast was nine months ago some
[03:11] somewhere along those lines I think
[03:13] April or May last year uh I don't
[03:16] remember exactly the date um maybe you
[03:18] can walk us through what happened since
[03:21] then uh what you have experienced so far
[03:24] in in suram and your fight against
[03:26] corruption and for Bitcoin well if you
[03:30] talking about May last year that's about
[03:32] the time when I went on the Dave podcast
[03:35] and revealed uh the corruption by the
[03:39] government advisor and you know why the
[03:42] legal tender law was being uh postponed
[03:47] constantly or not being uh dealt with or
[03:50] not you know being executed as the
[03:52] president had promised when Samson was
[03:55] here um and basically after that podcast
[03:59] I had a a couple of uh bouts of
[04:04] intimidation to stay out of the media so
[04:07] I uh I did for a while
[04:11] until you know the elections got closer
[04:14] and uh last October I started to go in
[04:16] the media a lot more uh we've been
[04:19] working I've continued working with
[04:22] dataless Labs on on building and with
[04:25] the circular economy of course on still
[04:27] Grassroots adoption
[04:30] um which I completely handed over to to
[04:33] Terren uh only I think two months ago um
[04:37] so it's been it's been quite the journey
[04:40] quite the challenge uh dealing
[04:43] with corruption here is not easy um it's
[04:47] not an easy path you know you're you're
[04:50] um fighting an uphill battle but I think
[04:52] that's that's all over the world if you
[04:54] look at the news right now right it's uh
[04:57] it's systemic everywhere so it feels
[04:59] feels like there's a global Purge
[05:02] ongoing um but yeah it's it's uh it's
[05:06] been quite the roller coaster ride since
[05:09] April to be honest uh but a a
[05:12] challenging um and exciting one I think
[05:17] um on the one hand uh and on the other
[05:20] hand of course it's uh it's it's
[05:24] difficult but I think if it if it was
[05:26] easy everybody would do would be doing
[05:28] it so
[05:30] it's uh it's it's been gaining a lot of
[05:33] momentum as well over the last couple of
[05:36] months so the the the the the closer we
[05:39] get to the elections the more momentum
[05:41] it gets the more um support it gets and
[05:45] it's it seemed you know it's a
[05:48] Countrywide problem we already know the
[05:50] entire population knows about corruption
[05:53] and if I entire population knows that
[05:55] the older politicians uh are corrupt
[05:58] have been corrupt for the last 50 years
[06:00] and everybody is aware of that and that
[06:03] is the main issue of these elections
[06:06] that that uh everybody is is talking
[06:09] about its
[06:10] corruption so it's
[06:13] um it's it's an interesting time in the
[06:17] country as well because these elections
[06:19] are crucial right it's uh we either go
[06:23] and for move forward into a future where
[06:27] we are a developed Nation with oil you
[06:31] know oil richness but also a diversified
[06:33] economy or we fall deeper into
[06:38] corruption right because it's it's only
[06:40] going to get significantly worse if the
[06:42] same leadership takes over and you don't
[06:44] have the right um legal Frameworks in
[06:47] place to to decentralize government
[06:50] governance because right now that is is
[06:53] an issue so one of the core um aspects
[06:56] of my program or the implementation plan
[07:00] that you know together with rahee we've
[07:02] been working on is the Constitution as
[07:05] well aside from other key
[07:08] focuses so it is it is a a nationwide
[07:12] issue that needs to be tackled which is
[07:14] quite the challenge but a very
[07:16] interesting uh challenge nonetheless I
[07:19] think that's why why Rahim likes it so
[07:20] much it's fun right just I I I just also
[07:24] saw uh your your Twitter posting about
[07:27] security uh is is that something that
[07:30] you just got because uh you for
[07:33] preventative things or you you actually
[07:36] was like uh you felt insecure in the
[07:39] country
[07:41] or are you secure in in Surinam and is
[07:45] is everything all right with that well I
[07:47] mean I've had I've I've been a political
[07:50] activist before I even you know when
[07:54] decided to go into uh these elections
[07:57] that was only 10 months ago right and I
[08:00] I keep saying I I keep repeating it's
[08:02] Samson's fault because Samson's the one
[08:04] that pushed me a little bit over the
[08:06] edge to actually do it um but me
[08:09] together with the other political
[08:11] activists in the country everyone
[08:13] everyone that's fighting against
[08:15] corruption whatever corruption is at
[08:18] play um for the past couple of years
[08:21] we've all received death threats we've
[08:23] all um received intimidation you know
[08:25] one of my closest friends uh John Hoak
[08:29] for example he's currently fighting a
[08:31] chinalco deal uh which is uh an aluminum
[08:36] uh Refinery project that the government
[08:38] has been pushing for I don't know two
[08:41] two months now suddenly they they want
[08:43] to push it very fast it's very negative
[08:45] for the country and he has been fighting
[08:48] that uh publicly for the last two months
[08:52] and he received that threats his
[08:54] children are afraid to go to school he
[08:56] has up to security as well so it is a um
[09:02] it is a constant threat if you're if
[09:04] you're fighting against corruption here
[09:06] so I had to flee the country 2022 I came
[09:09] back and after the the the last uh
[09:12] podcast in April you know I got a
[09:14] personal
[09:15] threat um from from previous uh a
[09:20] previous president of this country and I
[09:24] stayed out of the media for a while I
[09:27] think I mentioned it on one of the
[09:28] podcasts earlier not I don't think it
[09:30] was ours I think it was another one but
[09:33] um stayed out of the media until about
[09:35] October
[09:36] November and then at a certain point you
[09:39] decide okay you know I don't have the
[09:41] funding for security at least not at
[09:44] that at that level but um I feel like
[09:47] I'm on the side of good and I I feel
[09:50] that
[09:51] it's for my country it's it's a risk I'm
[09:54] willing to take
[09:55] so I just went back into the media and
[09:58] back into into the into the the the
[10:02] political campaigning
[10:04] basically um with within the NPS uh
[10:08] primarily and just in the media
[10:11] independently and I recently got
[10:14] security at home uh which is it's
[10:19] um it it I I didn't realize honestly how
[10:22] much of an impact it was having until I
[10:25] got
[10:26] security I would have um like moments
[10:30] where I was sleeping or trying to sleep
[10:32] I wouldn't sleep in my bedroom anymore
[10:34] uh upstairs I would uh sleep downstairs
[10:37] on the couch with the TV on uh just to
[10:39] to feel a bit safer and if I would sleep
[10:42] upstairs I would hear something fall uh
[10:45] in the backyard for example like a plant
[10:47] or a leaf or you know not knowing if
[10:50] it's if it's something but I would I
[10:52] would stay awake for an hour or two
[10:54] hours or three hours and not be able to
[10:56] fall asleep again and then I come
[10:58] downstairs so so it was having an impact
[11:02] and then when security came in that's
[11:05] when I kind of realized okay I don't
[11:07] have
[11:08] that that feeling anymore you know that
[11:11] someone can come in at any moment or
[11:14] someone can break in at any moment or
[11:18] because that's usually what they do
[11:19] that's what they've done with um a lot
[11:21] of the people I know that are active in
[11:24] politics and are you know against
[11:27] corruption they send uh Rob to break in
[11:31] you know that's the that's the way they
[11:33] work and that's the the fear I had so
[11:36] this is it helps 24-hour security uh
[11:40] just to know that at least that is not
[11:44] an option and they're not going to do
[11:46] anything publicly they at least
[11:48] historically they haven't so in that
[11:51] regard I feel safe and I mean you can
[11:53] mitigate risk as much as you want but
[11:56] it's not you know it's I I I think I'm
[12:00] I'm just putting faith in the fact that
[12:01] I'm on the side of good and I think that
[12:05] is
[12:05] important absolutely which uh especially
[12:09] when it when it gets hard you always ask
[12:11] yourself the question of like why am I
[12:13] really doing that like is if there's
[12:14] like an actual threat against my life
[12:16] you're always like uh why do I really uh
[12:19] do that um I don't know how deep we went
[12:22] into that last time um but it definitely
[12:26] makes sense to go into that a little bit
[12:29] Al this time why are you uh why did you
[12:32] decide to come back in the media why did
[12:34] you not stay silent why did you have
[12:37] this this big need of like okay let's or
[12:39] this big calling of like let's let's
[12:41] have let's have a better future for for
[12:43] Surinam well you know sometimes you get
[12:46] you get caught up in just work or your
[12:49] own life right and then
[12:51] you you forget why you're doing
[12:55] something like this for example and it
[12:58] was actually last year during the focus
[13:00] groups we were doing focus groups um to
[13:03] get an idea of what people their
[13:06] concerns were you know what the what the
[13:08] main issues were for for um just
[13:11] surinamese from from all walks of life
[13:14] in the
[13:15] country
[13:17] and then you're confronted with you know
[13:20] real stories again with reality again
[13:24] and there was a 17-year-old
[13:27] kid and and he's battling for his life
[13:30] he's in Colombia right now he couldn't
[13:33] be be um operated on here our hospitals
[13:37] are on the verge of closing they were
[13:39] going to close on on 15
[13:41] February um
[13:43] again and in December also on the verge
[13:46] of closing the situation isn't great at
[13:48] our hospitals um they don't have basic
[13:50] supplies so no needles no um no IV bags
[13:56] um a lot of operations can't be done
[14:00] and you know that is something we've
[14:02] known for the last couple of months
[14:04] already it's been getting systemically
[14:05] worse the Neo needle Department had to
[14:08] be closed um because babies had died
[14:11] there's not enough staff um not enough
[14:13] supplies but um hearing him talk about
[14:18] it and hearing his story and then him
[14:24] giving the EXP and he's a bitcoiner he's
[14:26] been he's been in the community for a
[14:28] while like he's been following me for a
[14:29] while he's also part of the camese
[14:32] community and this 17-year-old kid tells
[14:34] me that um if you're not one of the rich
[14:39] or Elite in Surinam then you get left to
[14:42] die right young kid his entire life
[14:45] ahead of him the super smart kid and
[14:47] then very you know even though he's
[14:50] facing all these challenges uh having to
[14:52] do dialysis every day he
[14:56] uh he still cares about Bitcoin and and
[14:59] helping us and and promoting education
[15:02] and coming to the education center to do
[15:04] the me premere courses right so it
[15:08] um that was a reality check that uh he's
[15:12] facing life and death every day
[15:15] so I love my country enough to that I
[15:18] can't leave for longer than three weeks
[15:20] I get
[15:21] depressed and I love my people you know
[15:24] I respect them very much and that's all
[15:28] the way to the indigenous tribes all the
[15:30] way to the interior to the ones in the
[15:32] city and I think you know people from
[15:35] come from outside and have this
[15:36] perception of who we are or how we think
[15:39] or how we should be but they don't I
[15:43] mean they don't know us you know we are
[15:46] we we're we should be an example for the
[15:49] world we are a diverse
[15:52] cultured multiethnic population that
[15:55] even while the rest of the world is
[15:57] fighting with immigration and and
[15:59] um you know religion we have a mosque
[16:02] next to a synagogue and we live in peace
[16:05] with each other and we're we we we we
[16:08] we we celebrate each other's
[16:11] holidays there is a beauty in this
[16:14] country and its nature and its people
[16:16] that others only see when they've been
[16:19] really really really been here you know
[16:22] and are open to actually seeing the
[16:25] beauty of our country and I I see that
[16:27] and I feel that and I feel it's worth
[16:28] fighting in for so I I made the decision
[16:31] after that to just to just go for it and
[16:35] trust you know trust in in the universe
[16:38] trust in God trust in whatever
[16:41] to that things would turn out right and
[16:44] if they didn't
[16:45] then I guess that's how it's meant to be
[16:49] super interesting uh um also interesting
[16:53] for for Rahim um why you now decided to
[16:57] to help uh Maya and also uh from someone
[17:02] that uh probably you haven't been to
[17:05] Surinam before I don't know how many
[17:07] touch points you had in your life before
[17:08] already that uh but how do you look at
[17:12] the situation there and and uh since
[17:15] since you there like what is kind of
[17:16] your feel for the country yeah indeed
[17:18] it's my first time here very few people
[17:20] had Surinam on their map before learning
[17:23] about Maya so she helped me see the
[17:26] beauty of the country is a TR truly
[17:28] unique country but uh what seems to be a
[17:31] blessing is actually a curse uh the
[17:33] richness in natural resources usually
[17:35] and that's paradoxical does not help
[17:37] with economic development because it
[17:39] means centralized control over wealth
[17:42] usually and that of course entices
[17:45] corruption uh and usually leads to kind
[17:48] of consumption uh so so far they haven't
[17:52] even made that much out of these natural
[17:54] resources so in a sense there's still
[17:56] hope it's not an entrenched oil
[17:59] oligarchy yet but uh they expect to
[18:03] receive a lot of money uh from oil uh
[18:06] findings and we can see in other
[18:07] countries how that can work out so I
[18:10] think it's that's why it's crucial to do
[18:12] something different here and that's why
[18:14] it's such a unique case it's like not
[18:17] all the harm has already been done it's
[18:19] in a sense an unspoiled country uh 90%
[18:22] is still jungle and rivers uh um it's a
[18:27] unique population where friendly
[18:29] peaceful diverse people uh but uh some
[18:33] of the best surinamese of course have
[18:34] left the country as in many places do
[18:37] lack economic development but that's
[18:39] also a huge potential I mean it's the
[18:41] only majority Dutch speaking country in
[18:43] the region so it has links not only to
[18:46] the Netherlands there are other Dutch
[18:47] speaking minorities in South Africa for
[18:50] example uh Belgium so it's quite an
[18:54] important cultural sphere to connect to
[18:56] and a lot of surnames of course live in
[18:58] the Netherlands and elsewhere uh and
[19:00] that makes it even more unique um I know
[19:04] a situation that's a bit similar from
[19:06] Lebanon that I know very well as a
[19:08] country that also has a diaspora that's
[19:11] larger than the population within the
[19:12] country uh that's also challenge if it's
[19:15] only means remittances from families
[19:17] that make more money than those left
[19:20] behind but if you can tap into that uh
[19:24] then uh it's it's it's a huge Resource
[19:26] as well the most important one not the
[19:28] natural resources the human resource and
[19:30] the creativity that abounds and the
[19:32] surinamese like the Lebanese and and and
[19:35] other people that live outside tend to
[19:37] belong the more to the more successful
[19:40] uh immigrants uh outside of the country
[19:42] so a lot of surinamese are impressive in
[19:45] what they've achieved outside of the
[19:46] country and if they realize that there's
[19:49] a reason now to put that country back on
[19:51] the map of the globe that's just a huge
[19:54] potential that to tap into and of that
[19:56] of course must trigger the interest of
[19:58] everyone who's into economics and cares
[20:01] about economics as collaboration as
[20:03] wealth creation as win-win relations
[20:06] between people that that makes it really
[20:08] interesting to me so I I needed some
[20:11] convincing in particular Philip BOS like
[20:14] pushed
[20:15] me to come here and I I'm still like
[20:18] trying to figure out I'm a very
[20:20] realistic person of course so I am very
[20:22] inquisitive here uh and and try to see
[20:25] what are the chances uh to put that
[20:28] country on the right TR I partnered up
[20:30] with coin vigilante this is the most
[20:33] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[20:36] saw created by anyone look at that
[20:39] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante

[21:23] love those watches so so much if you
[21:26] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[21:28] regular basis I guess you already bought
[21:31] some Bitcoin and now the most important
[21:33] step is to keep the Bitcoin keep them
[21:36] secure in a hardware wallet my personal
[21:39] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[21:41] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[21:43] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[21:46] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[21:49] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[21:52] with the code Robin at the checkout
[21:54] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[21:58] your bitbox and the next step is to
[22:01] really level up your sovereignty as an
[22:03] individual you have to have the most
[22:05] secure self- custody setup you have to
[22:08] secure your own devices you have to
[22:11] protect your privacy you have to set up
[22:14] an inheritance plan and depending on
[22:16] where you live you even want to have a
[22:19] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[22:22] in case something goes really really
[22:23] wrong and through all those steps the
[22:25] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[22:28] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[22:31] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[22:35] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[22:38] how you can level up your sovereignty uh
[22:41] where would you put the chances that
[22:43] that uh Maya gets an office the the
[22:46] country is getting in the right
[22:48] direction uh and and uh the things are
[22:51] happening to do do how high is the
[22:55] chance that this actually happens the
[22:56] chance when you start a startup
[22:59] and hope for it to become a successful
[23:01] Enterprise is about
[23:03] 10% uh so it's extremely low still
[23:06] people do it uh and it's crucially
[23:08] important to do it and that's what
[23:10] brings change uh so I can't assess the
[23:14] exact chances here I think if uh you
[23:18] have the right principles and you have
[23:19] the high passion and power then
[23:21] something that even may seem improbable
[23:23] at one point can change the world so I
[23:27] think it's very hard to ass uh the
[23:29] probabilities now it's much easier to
[23:32] assess the need the necessity the upside
[23:35] potential and that's I think how you
[23:38] would value an uncertain entt taking
[23:40] undertaking like that like that one like
[23:42] a really courageous Venture yeah and I I
[23:45] think the chances are higher than with
[23:46] most startups
[23:48] so I'm Taking My Chances
[23:51] here at least we're higher than a
[23:53] startup
[23:55] right I mean if you if you look at uh a
[23:58] I think risk to reward ratio you know um
[24:05] some of the things that we have do have
[24:08] going for us you know as I I think you
[24:11] remember from the last podcast I've you
[24:14] you you look for solutions to problems
[24:17] based off your own life experiences
[24:19] right and I looked for solutions for the
[24:22] country based off of my own experiences
[24:25] here not just with corruption but also
[24:27] the private sector the lack of uh
[24:29] Financial infrastructure online payment
[24:31] methods anything that that I'd
[24:34] encountered throughout my
[24:36] life and you know Bitcoin looking to me
[24:41] as as the solution to all these problems
[24:45] which is why I've been advocating for it
[24:47] here publicly you know conferences about
[24:51] eight years ago uh and working uh to
[24:55] build the Capital Market here about 8
[24:57] years ago
[24:59] so I've been publicly advocating for bit
[25:02] for Bitcoin now for quite some time in
[25:04] Surinam and I've gone to to conferences
[25:07] uh you know went to New York Early when
[25:10] coin I I think consensus uh was one of
[25:12] the first conferences at the time to
[25:14] lobby for Surinam to be the Bitcoin
[25:16] country or or for Bitcoin to be adopted
[25:20] here uh went to Salvador in 2021 to
[25:23] adopting Bitcoin when I heard that it
[25:25] was adopted there to try and convince
[25:27] them you know to to try and convince Max
[25:30] and Stacy that Surinam should do the
[25:33] same and we should fight to do the same
[25:35] in Surinam and uh I remember back then
[25:39] she told me to get elected so now here
[25:41] we are four years later by happen
[25:43] St um I am running in these elections
[25:48] and you know I I asked um I think it was
[25:51] Daniel uh winging from gooy like how do
[25:54] I get that here like I need I was trying
[25:56] to reach out to anyone I could uh I knew
[25:59] within the industry to get uh to get
[26:01] adoption here uh at a at a Countrywide
[26:04] you know Nationwide um level and he also
[26:08] told me like you need to speak to Samson
[26:11] or uh you need to convince to get you
[26:13] need to convince them to get on a plane
[26:15] and and and get here and that's I think
[26:18] how it how that got started so I've been
[26:20] trying every every possible approach uh
[26:24] for the last seven to eight years and
[26:26] they say usually a startup you know if
[26:28] you don't give up somewhere over a
[26:31] decade of time you you will be
[26:35] successful so the timing seems right for
[26:38] risk to reward absolutely really
[26:40] interesting um how is it for you to to
[26:43] run as a candidate uh you it's the first
[26:45] time you you run for for for something
[26:48] like that if if I'm right yeah so I I'm
[26:51] I'm not a politician right and and
[26:54] people know me as as not being a
[26:56] politician and or at least those that
[26:58] that know of know me or know of Me by
[27:01] some I'm just known as the Bitcoin lady
[27:03] don't even know my name so if you talk
[27:05] about Bitcoin they think of me um others
[27:09] uh have never heard of me um and see me
[27:12] right now for the first time for example
[27:14] on the news or in some
[27:16] podcast
[27:18] um it's
[27:21] um it's
[27:23] interesting right because I've I've been
[27:26] if if if in in the last eight years for
[27:29] example dealing with government from a
[27:31] different angle um developing the
[27:33] Capital Market the National Stock
[27:35] Exchange and pushing for Bitcoin
[27:37] adoption here you know speaking at
[27:39] conferences across from the governor of
[27:41] the Central Bank things like that you
[27:44] you have a different type of
[27:45] relationship working and dealing with
[27:47] government and it wasn't you know it was
[27:50] never uh easy never good and I I wasn't
[27:54] I'm not a big fan of the state anyway so
[27:57] you constantly have um you know problems
[28:01] basically with uh with government
[28:03] especially in such a corrup country and
[28:05] the last time I dealt with government
[28:07] was um
[28:09] 2020 I presented to this government uh
[28:13] the current
[28:14] president um at cabinet
[28:17] and I was working on the same you know
[28:20] the developing the Capital Market here
[28:22] and Bitcoin adoption and
[28:26] um it now you're seeing it from now I'm
[28:28] seeing it from the other side right now
[28:31] I'm seeing from the political parties
[28:33] and I'm
[28:35] seeing how how they work and how they
[28:39] operate and it it is there is so much
[28:44] bureaucracy in political parties it's
[28:47] it's it's worse than government it seems
[28:50] because the B the bureaucracy is insane
[28:53] insane and you know I wouldn't say that
[28:56] our government is very Democratic
[28:59] especially not at the moment it's very
[29:02] totalitarian um and within the political
[29:05] parties it's it's a little bit the same
[29:08] within all of them and it's I think just
[29:12] as corrupt as as
[29:14] Government so it's it's not any better
[29:18] right so when I go on TV for example or
[29:20] on the podcast I not only speak out
[29:24] against corruption or against existing
[29:26] government I actually say that it is you
[29:29] know it's a system that is broken it's a
[29:31] system that that that is at fault um and
[29:34] we really need to change the system all
[29:36] the way from the the corrupt core and
[29:40] and overhaul the the entire governance
[29:44] structure with a new Constitution which
[29:46] we've had um it was promised to us as a
[29:50] people since
[29:51] 1987 and no government has ever actually
[29:55] even tried to hold a referendum them
[29:59] because which government would want to
[30:01] relinquish power right so we just had
[30:04] Samuel Coleman here give a presentation
[30:06] and that was our national
[30:08] launch uh of you know fighting for this
[30:11] new
[30:12] constitution um So the plan is to hold a
[30:16] referendum uh on November 24th so that's
[30:20] what I'm pushing
[30:21] for um and which I'll be pushing
[30:23] publicly in in the media over the next
[30:26] uh couple of weeks as well is to push
[30:28] for a new constitution because that
[30:30] changes things that changes governance
[30:32] and government at the core and then it's
[30:35] an in an in a very extensive integral
[30:39] plan on how to change and restructure
[30:42] reform government and decrease the size
[30:44] of government and government overreach
[30:46] after that um which is basically rahim's
[30:51] responsibility so now it's his uh now
[30:54] it's his responsibility to fix the
[30:56] country
[30:59] but it's a it's a it's um it's it's a
[31:03] comprehensive plan with a lot of
[31:04] measures
[31:06] um uh partially you know similar to uh
[31:10] what's been done in Argentina a lot of
[31:12] the what's what's happening in the US
[31:14] what you can see that has happened in in
[31:15] El Salvador we're not the same countries
[31:18] of course we're a lot smaller we have
[31:20] 600,000 people the footprint of the city
[31:23] is very small uh it we can be a lot more
[31:27] agile we have some benefits but it's
[31:30] still a
[31:32] a systemic change right that that has to
[31:35] be implemented so there are a lot of
[31:38] different moving parts and lot that has
[31:41] to be
[31:42] done and a lot of people that are
[31:45] working uh collaboratively towards a
[31:47] common goal so it's quite a challenge
[31:50] but I think you know not not not not
[31:52] nothing like or
[31:54] unlike uh the other countries that are
[31:56] are moving in the same direction I mean
[31:58] if if it's been done somewhere else I
[32:00] see no reason why it couldn't be done
[32:03] here that's it's also maybe a question
[32:05] for for him really interesting what do
[32:08] you what do you think are the the things
[32:11] that uh Maya and Surinam could Implement
[32:15] uh as a role model from maybe other
[32:17] countries and maybe also how do you look
[32:19] at current developments like do in in in
[32:22] America not the coin the the government
[32:25] efficiency agency um and Argentina with
[32:29] Cher M and also mid with n p are those
[32:34] kind of almost Ro models of like how to
[32:37] cut back on on government spending or
[32:40] any other
[32:42] examples uh yes those are like the most
[32:45] positive things maybe in politics it's
[32:47] very rare that you have anti-political
[32:50] politics it only sometimes happens when
[32:53] like new interest groups emerge and they
[32:56] figure out that they don't control all
[32:58] yet enough of the resources so that led
[33:01] to Doge I think figuring out that there
[33:04] actually is a deep state that there is
[33:06] like uh undemocratic spending of uh tax
[33:11] money and that money for purposes that
[33:14] seem very odd but it's just there to for
[33:18] for the interest of groups people to get
[33:21] income and Status uh and power out of
[33:24] this spending uh so I don't believe in
[33:26] politics at all so I'm not a typical
[33:28] political adviser I would never have
[33:30] come if Maya sounded anywhere like a
[33:33] politician uh I despise most politicians
[33:36] I think the best way to help a country
[33:39] is get politics out of the way um and it
[33:42] means just take away the possibility to
[33:45] do harm uh and and that's like Do no
[33:48] harm principle but that of course means
[33:52] decentralization uh so trying to figure
[33:54] out how you can have a structural reform
[33:56] that decentralizes uh of course in
[33:59] countries like this you don't have a
[34:01] strong Civil Society you don't even have
[34:03] a strong private sector that could take
[34:05] over immediately so it makes it that
[34:08] much more challenging and the Temptation
[34:09] is very high to just like get the right
[34:11] person in power and fix everything I I
[34:14] don't think you can fix everything I I
[34:16] don't even think Bitcoin fixes
[34:18] everything so I'm I'm I'm very down to
[34:20] earth I'd say in that regard but it's an
[34:22] important part of the picture so
[34:25] countries like that really need
[34:27] money and brains and people from the
[34:31] outside uh that's the immediate thing
[34:34] everything else everything that leads to
[34:37] like a homegrown productivity increase
[34:41] uh is a cultural thing that may take a
[34:44] generation or more uh all the potential
[34:47] is here and and we've seen it that it's
[34:49] not dependent on a
[34:51] particular uh ethnicity or culture but
[34:54] it's certain habits certain mindsets uh
[34:57] certain openness to development that has
[34:59] to emerge over time and that you have to
[35:01] learn from positive examples that it's
[35:04] possible to like improve something about
[35:06] your life uh pass it on to your family
[35:09] uh that you are responsible for your
[35:11] environment uh around you and and
[35:13] yourself and your family um and then
[35:16] maybe even a company and so on that's
[35:19] the latest stage so Bitcoin may play a
[35:22] role here in uh it's the most mobile
[35:25] form of capital and attracting Capital
[35:29] to the country and it plays a role in
[35:32] allowing the population to save uh but
[35:35] the main challenge in savings is usually
[35:37] cultural it's just its habits uh of
[35:40] course they are not flourishing because
[35:42] if the political structure does not
[35:44] allow you uh to save uh and and it's
[35:48] usually like the Fiat system uh usually
[35:51] all the or a large part of the economic
[35:54] returns goes to the producers of money
[35:57] and here it's uh the local currency that
[36:00] of course is uh gradually replaced by
[36:03] the US dollar which doesn't make it
[36:05] fairer it's
[36:07] just a more stable version of the same
[36:10] thing
[36:11] gradual dispossession of purchasing
[36:14] power of the population so that why I
[36:17] think in places like that in particular
[36:19] Bitcoin it's much more than in other
[36:22] places uh of course there'll be more
[36:25] Bitcoin adoption in wealthier places I
[36:27] seen the the highest Bitcoin adoption
[36:29] I've seen is in Switzerland where I live
[36:32] it's like all the local banks around
[36:34] where I live offer Bitcoin and it's
[36:37] becoming normalized but as a wealth
[36:39] asset as a savings device uh as
[36:42] something you save in um and uh of
[36:47] course if the population most people
[36:49] here live from paycheck to paycheck if
[36:51] they live at all on a paycheck uh so
[36:54] that's that's why usually with
[36:56] development you need Capital come come
[36:58] in uh and for a long time Surinam has
[37:02] experienced brain drain and capital
[37:04] drain and if you can reverse that course
[37:07] uh that's I think the first step uh to
[37:10] do and a lot of it is now International
[37:13] competition you have to figure out how
[37:15] do you have to improve the context here
[37:17] so that people would come go to Surinam
[37:20] and not to Dubai or other places uh uh
[37:24] and what's the best context uh for
[37:27] invest investors for entrepreneurs for
[37:29] people who just need to discover the
[37:31] country to fall in love with it and and
[37:33] come back and and maybe stay here and uh
[37:36] uh invest in the country improve the
[37:38] country uh anything like that uh that's
[37:40] that's the way forward and there's a lot
[37:42] of interlocking pieces and that's why I
[37:45] think Maya is right that it's kind of
[37:47] constitutional change even that's needed
[37:49] so even more profound than the
[37:51] Constitutional change is a cultural
[37:52] change but that takes a long time so if
[37:55] you're very lucky you have a process
[37:57] where you can have a structural
[37:58] constitutional change within a lifetime
[38:01] that happens rarely but Surinam seems to
[38:04] be ready for de because very few people
[38:07] are happy with the structures existing
[38:10] there's like not a lot a lot of belief
[38:14] in the kind of constitutional setup of
[38:15] the country there's belief in the
[38:17] country and the people uh but it seems
[38:20] like kind of Taz as a green field where
[38:22] you can try out new things and and most
[38:25] people should see that there's not that
[38:26] much to lose but there's a lot to win
[38:29] interesting do do you see uh Switzerland
[38:31] as the kind of the role model with
[38:33] direct democracy and a little bit more
[38:35] decentralized uh
[38:37] structures no uh current Switzerland
[38:40] can't be a role model because it's
[38:41] already too wealthy uh so it's on the
[38:44] way downwards as most of Europe just way
[38:47] behind historical Switzerland uh is the
[38:50] example so that's the biggest mistake
[38:53] you can make is try to learn from rich
[38:55] countries wealthy countries as they are
[38:58] today that's not how they became Rich
[39:01] that's how they are getting poor and SS
[39:05] politicians are not much better than
[39:07] politicians elsewhere uh so I think
[39:09] generally that's why I don't believe in
[39:11] politics it's very easy to be as
[39:13] politician now because there's so much
[39:15] money to spend it's like endless
[39:17] opportunities to show how great you are
[39:20] and how much good you can do with other
[39:22] people's money uh and that of course
[39:24] leads to another kind of systemic
[39:26] corruption now the country my home
[39:27] country that I've left for Switzerland
[39:30] and that you're
[39:32] still staying in Robin until you figure
[39:35] out where where it's going and then
[39:38] maybe you skip Switzerland come to
[39:39] Surinam right away Austria is of course
[39:43] much worse in that regard it's a it's
[39:46] hugely corrupt Society very different
[39:48] corruption from Surinam so it's not this
[39:50] kind of
[39:52] openly uh and seemingly unfair
[39:55] corruption because just a small part is
[39:57] just a small political Elite uh and and
[40:00] a bit maybe cartel structures and so on
[40:02] in Austria is the majority of the
[40:04] population who believe that they are
[40:06] beneficiaries of the kind of corruption
[40:09] uh there just endless ways of spending
[40:11] other people's money and it's like the
[40:14] great saying of basa one of the
[40:15] forerunners of the Austrian School the
[40:18] government is the great illusion whereby
[40:20] everyone tries to live at the expense of
[40:23] our everyone else and that has been
[40:26] defining in way Western wealthy
[40:28] countries and they can do a lot of that
[40:31] because they are so wealthy and now in
[40:33] Surinam you feel the effects of that
[40:35] kind of corruption so even though it's
[40:38] like a smaller class it hampers a lot
[40:40] it's it's obvious I think to most
[40:42] peoples that they don't get their fair
[40:45] share of that but in in in Switzerland
[40:48] of course most people are satisfied and
[40:50] and feel always fine is one of the
[40:51] richest places it's a great place to
[40:53] live at right now um uh in 20 years from
[40:57] now I don't know it'll be worse probably
[41:00] I still have some hopes for Switzerland
[41:02] for Austria I know for sure that you can
[41:04] extrapolate and for sure in 10 years and
[41:07] 20 years from now it'll be a poorer uh
[41:09] worse off Society with a lot of internal
[41:12] divisions with a decreased quality of
[41:15] life and then I mean for now it would
[41:17] seem crazy to leave Austria Switzerland
[41:19] to go to Surinam everyone think you
[41:21] crazy to leave that behind uh but we are
[41:24] reaching a stage where more and more
[41:25] even Swiss people I know a lot of Swiss
[41:27] were leaving Switzerland just to seek
[41:29] more freedom elsewhere uh to build up
[41:32] something uh from a new and uh uh if you
[41:36] have like the wrong kinds of opinions
[41:39] the wrong kind of business ideas and
[41:41] stuff you feel the loss of freedom in
[41:44] the west uh in particular in Europe of
[41:47] course how we all regulated to death
[41:51] more or less and and Switzerland gets
[41:53] some of that unfortunately even though
[41:55] it's not part of the EU but I was pretty
[41:57] close pretty close
[41:59] shot and still it Imports a lot of that
[42:02] craziness and that's just other
[42:04] distruction of wealth and it happens
[42:06] when you're very wealthy you know when
[42:08] you're very wealthy and you haven't
[42:09] deserved it and you don't know where it
[42:11] comes from then it's just consumption
[42:13] spending and some part of that spending
[42:15] is uh kind of luxury beliefs now you can
[42:18] afford to have crazy beliefs that have
[42:20] nothing to do with realities like
[42:22] Illusions but you can entertain them
[42:25] because you have enough money it doesn't
[42:26] matter you can very crazy ideas
[42:28] everything fails that you touch but
[42:30] there is enough to try again and again
[42:33] and again and and that's where we get
[42:35] this like mind viruses from that destroy
[42:39] uh Western Civilization from inside kind
[42:42] of luxury beliefs uh and part of it is
[42:45] conspicuous spending that you see in
[42:47] countries like here and try to emulate
[42:49] and imitate and that's usually the wrong
[42:51] way so let's try to learn from Europe
[42:53] when it was getting wealthier and that's
[42:55] already a long time ago
[42:57] that's when the austri school for
[42:59] example emerged that was the Austria you
[43:01] should learn from is the Austria when
[43:03] the Austrian School actually emerged in
[43:06] 19th century Austria in Switzerland it
[43:08] started even
[43:10] earlier the kind of process of wealth of
[43:13] generating
[43:14] wealth yeah so we do see for
[43:18] example things
[43:20] that you know would be needed
[43:24] here for example our constitution right
[43:27] now gives way too much executive way too
[43:29] much gives too much executive power to
[43:32] the
[43:33] president um and that was because our
[43:37] constitution was written you know after
[43:40] a a a revolution where we had a dictator
[43:43] in place so it's it's very much in that
[43:46] similar Trend and a post
[43:48] Colonial um system and and mindset so a
[43:52] lot of our constitution is very
[43:56] centralized at the top so there is room
[43:59] to decentralize government uh governance
[44:03] bring it closer to the localities to the
[44:06] people and for example direct democracy
[44:09] that is something that even during uh
[44:11] Samuel's presentation speaks to to a lot
[44:15] of the politicians and and
[44:18] non-politicians um that I spoke to after
[44:21] after his uh
[44:23] presentation and also you know I've been
[44:26] speaking about it for the last month and
[44:29] a half or so in in media and it does
[44:32] seem to resonate with the people as well
[44:34] being able to more
[44:36] directly um decide determine
[44:40] what what happens you know within their
[44:44] their own area or their own
[44:46] District um and not only have to choose
[44:49] you know every 5 years and then
[44:51] basically every five years needing to
[44:55] select between the the between bad and
[44:58] worse
[44:59] basically
[45:00] um and I see contrary to to Rahim uh
[45:05] Bitcoin not as a uh just savings but
[45:10] actually you know money for the country
[45:14] so this is something we've been debating
[45:16] for the last couple of days as
[45:19] well to to if if if Bitcoin can be a
[45:25] national currency where you actually
[45:27] have it be money
[45:29] um you know I see in the circular
[45:32] economy for example the Grassroots level
[45:35] how easy it is to
[45:37] use um by even the most uneducated of
[45:41] people in the most remote areas of the
[45:44] country
[45:45] um and then at the government level how
[45:48] do you actually Implement you know how
[45:51] do you actually Implement Bitcoin as
[45:53] money then it comes with with economic
[45:55] challenges and and systematic challenges
[45:58] in the country um and it's a it's a
[46:00] weigh of of risk and risk versus
[46:04] rewards but I think our unique situation
[46:07] puts us in the right position to
[46:08] actually implement it so we've been
[46:11] having discussions even yesterday I
[46:13] think for
[46:14] hours uh about whether it can be or
[46:18] cannot be and I think that's a that's a
[46:22] sorry go ahead no I was just curious
[46:25] what what those those uh discussions
[46:28] about of like if Bitcoin is because it's
[46:31] uh it's I've been like for example in
[46:34] salador uh I've been there and I've not
[46:38] been able to pay a lot with Bitcoin uh
[46:41] it was like was not as as uh widely
[46:45] adopted as I thought it is um and
[46:48] obviously you have still a huge
[46:50] volatility like all those things but
[46:53] since um around six or seven months I
[46:55] get actually most my income now in
[46:57] Bitcoin and I would love for it just to
[47:00] be all in Bitcoin and I don't have to
[47:03] worry about capital gains taxes or
[47:05] anything like that and just like a live
[47:07] live on bitcoin like I earn Bitcoin I
[47:09] live on bitcoin that would be the the
[47:11] perfect State I currently don't do that
[47:13] I currently still uh try to figure out
[47:15] how to live off the field and just save
[47:18] in Bitcoin uh but I I would love that so
[47:21] like but but it seems maybe just too
[47:23] early what are your thoughts
[47:27] well I I'm mostly interested in what is
[47:30] uh what could be that's for me it's
[47:33] entrepreneurs and inventors and
[47:36] Innovation my task as an economist as as
[47:39] an Austrian Economist in the original
[47:41] meaning is to be the contrarian realist
[47:43] just look at things as they are uh and
[47:46] then Maya has a different task uh and
[47:48] that's that's fine I'm just I mean if
[47:50] you want to discuss with me you figure
[47:53] out you'll have a hard time
[47:55] usually just the contrarian I'm
[47:58] inquisitive I want to understand things
[48:01] and I want to see how things are now and
[48:03] understand why they are that way uh so
[48:06] I'm not selling hope I'm not a
[48:07] politician I do nothing of that I try to
[48:10] be competent and understanding what's
[48:12] going on I think that's very helpful uh
[48:14] to bring it to the table I think it adds
[48:16] a lot of value if it's done right I
[48:19] think it's very difficult to do that
[48:21] right uh and uh I think that's where
[48:24] most of the value of the Austrian School
[48:26] Li
[48:27] if you apply to practical aspects and
[48:30] one practical aspect could be politics
[48:32] in in very few situations that allow for
[48:35] that usually it's investing or
[48:37] entrepreneurship where if you imply it
[48:39] contrarian realism it adds value uh so I
[48:42] do what I can do best and of course if
[48:44] you look at bitcoin's history uh it
[48:47] would be foolish now to deny the
[48:49] importance of Bitcoin or to talk about
[48:51] it as if it was this new thing it's or
[48:53] it's just a fed or a tulip pubble or
[48:56] something that just shows you that
[48:57] people have no clue whatsoever and and
[48:59] no respect for what's been going on for
[49:01] 16 years and no interest even to figure
[49:03] out what's been going on so it's
[49:06] definitely a phenomenon to be taken
[49:08] seriously and I wouldn't take any
[49:09] Economist seriously who doesn't figure
[49:11] out that it's important as Maya says and
[49:14] sees it for a while and and that's
[49:17] that's unusual uh to see that uh uh
[49:21] interestingly because change takes a lot
[49:24] of time so we are still early as we tend
[49:27] to say in Bitcoin uh so and things are
[49:30] if you're early a lot of times
[49:32] frustrating and not there yet and uh uh
[49:36] so it takes a while and then of course
[49:38] you can do mistakes I I do think I mean
[49:41] po politics is the riskiest thing you
[49:45] can do because you want to decide for
[49:48] other people you think you can help more
[49:50] people than yourself and in most cases
[49:53] it doesn't work out so you got to be
[49:54] very careful uh with any kind of power
[49:58] you get because people believe in you
[50:00] what you tell them or they even trust
[50:03] you with changing the legal structure or
[50:06] the context how you look at things and I
[50:08] just say be very careful with that trust
[50:11] and so as long as most people have not
[50:14] understood how Bitcoin can be useful to
[50:17] them and why it's of value to them it'll
[50:20] always feel forced and uh human beings
[50:23] don't learn by being forced they learn
[50:25] by discovering things and that's a
[50:27] crucial Insight of the Austrian School
[50:28] that the important institutions need to
[50:30] be discovered like money is a discover
[50:32] it's not me saying as e as an economist
[50:34] it's now money or even more stupidly
[50:37] claiming no Bitcoin is not money it
[50:39] can't be money because my definition
[50:40] says it's never going to be money that's
[50:43] even more stupid but I still think as an
[50:45] economist you can just say it's it's
[50:48] money it's just it has an increasing
[50:50] money that's the right way to look at it
[50:53] uh which is very interesting very unique
[50:55] and we can figure out how to increase
[50:57] that money more and how to make it serve
[51:00] to people and help people discover that
[51:02] and how it can be helpful for that and
[51:05] in a lot of uh situations just means get
[51:08] out of the way for people to discover it
[51:11] um and increasing
[51:13] money so I yeah I I yeah she doesn't
[51:17] like the gradual part no I don't like
[51:19] the
[51:20] grad I don't I don't that's where we
[51:22] fight I don't like the the gradual
[51:25] approach or the gradual proc
[51:27] and I mean I've in the past eight years
[51:30] I've seen the industry evolve and I've
[51:33] seen you know Bitcoin transition from
[51:36] from basically unknown also ande as well
[51:40] you know from from relatively unknown to
[51:42] now being an an international topic
[51:45] discussed by multiple presidents and
[51:47] adopted at a nation state level and I do
[51:50] not believe that change needs to take
[51:53] Generations or decades because mobile
[51:56] phon did not take generations to to to
[52:00] uh be globally adopted as a consumption
[52:03] device they are adopted a tool well well
[52:08] well it also it also didn't take uh
[52:11] decades for buele to change El Salvador
[52:14] from the murder capital of the world to
[52:16] one of the safest in the Western
[52:17] Hemisphere and that's also um something
[52:20] that you would think you know would take
[52:22] Generations culturally to change uh some
[52:25] things take more more time and others
[52:27] take other time I'm not a gradualist in
[52:30] theory you know that's like the thing
[52:32] that's some learning from M roart so if
[52:35] you're a gradualist in theory then
[52:36] you'll always be a gradualist in
[52:39] practice but uh you can have very clear
[52:42] principles uh in theory and and and
[52:45] believe that something should happen
[52:47] quicker than they do happen but still be
[52:50] realist and see that some things need
[52:53] gradual change and then that that
[52:54] there's a risk in put pushing stuff uh
[52:57] you should only push stuff that you're
[52:59] absolutely certain about uh and even
[53:02] with entrepreneurs like even if it's
[53:05] only your money at risk that you're
[53:07] risking even there but I'm of course
[53:10] much less gradual in if it's my own
[53:14] money and my own
[53:16] responsibility then I I'm happy for risk
[53:19] I take
[53:20] risks any day and I'm happy for
[53:23] uncertainty I took a very long it's only
[53:27] like a past few years that I have been
[53:30] recommending Bitcoin it all it all
[53:32] depends on the situation like who uh so
[53:35] I followed Bitcoin from very early and
[53:37] studied very early but that it reaches a
[53:39] stage where you can for other people
[53:42] like what other people should do you're
[53:44] telling them what they should do and
[53:46] you've lame part of that responsibility
[53:48] because they look up to you and ask you
[53:50] what should I do where should I put my
[53:52] money uh and that just that's gradual
[53:55] unfortunately because you you have to
[53:56] talk to everyone at where he's at and at
[54:00] the uncertainty he's willing and ready
[54:01] to take and keep that in mind otherwise
[54:04] you're not helping someone you're just
[54:06] pushing as if he's not yourself he's not
[54:08] in your position uh so even though I'm I
[54:11] I I don't like gradualism neither in my
[54:14] life I'm not a very gradual person so I
[54:17] can like change 180 degrees if I think
[54:19] it's necessary the world changes and uh
[54:22] of course you change and you do it
[54:24] rapidly and it's better to be quick uh
[54:26] cut everything early and not to
[54:27] gradually like repeal your mistakes
[54:30] gradually no sometimes you cut
[54:32] completely yeah but just I mean and and
[54:35] there's a difference from The Economist
[54:36] is observing what's happening in reality
[54:38] then you describe things and you say
[54:40] okay well that looks more gradual than
[54:41] that I want to understand why and in
[54:44] many cases the natural developments are
[54:46] gradual and then suddenly that's just
[54:49] how things Happ we've had we've had
[54:51] three currency changes for example in
[54:53] this
[54:54] country um you know scratching zeros
[54:57] changing from suram Flor to suram Gilder
[55:00] to suram Dollar those are all Fiat
[55:02] changes Fiat changes so yeah but I see
[55:05] it as as the same Bitcoin
[55:10] being money you know the the distinction
[55:13] is is there's no Central Authority
[55:16] deciding what the value of your money is
[55:18] our Central Bank I've said this over the
[55:20] years and in multiple interviews as well
[55:22] our Central Bank does not really even
[55:24] function as a traditional central bank
[55:26] right it does not really control um the
[55:29] value of our money it doesn't really
[55:32] control the the economy even
[55:35] so I see no restriction as to if you
[55:39] were to say for example 100 million of a
[55:43] Bitcoin a satosi would be equal to yeah
[55:48] okay for the simplification one SRD for
[55:51] example or you know change it from SRD
[55:54] to SRT and
[55:57] suram Satoshi for example just thinking
[56:01] out loud here I see no reason why that
[56:05] conversion could not be accomplished
[56:07] though we haven't completely figured it
[56:09] out but that is usually how Innovation
[56:12] happens it's a matter of just figuring
[56:15] out the how or developing the
[56:18] how yeah I I try to help figure out ways
[56:21] here I just what quick remark there like
[56:25] a Fiat conv verions or Fiat definitions
[56:28] is I say I want it to be that way and it
[56:30] should that way and I Define something
[56:33] like that with Bitcoin and that's a
[56:34] great thing and the first digital thing
[56:38] that's not feat in that sense it has its
[56:40] own realities like it's costly and
[56:43] provably costly to produce it's not
[56:45] something you can Define you can't just
[56:46] say okay now I tell you you have that
[56:49] many Bitcoin everyone has to get Bitcoin
[56:51] the same way Y and that's a great thing
[56:54] about Bitcoin so it takes resource it's
[56:56] it's a more honest thing it's more
[56:57] honest asset uh and that makes it very
[57:00] difficult to just like get you away with
[57:03] Bitcoin so you have to be or you have to
[57:06] first assess that where does that value
[57:08] come from who does it go to and of
[57:11] course I try to gradually help Maya to
[57:15] then like suddenly have a positive
[57:17] change but unfortunately now I have to
[57:20] leave rather sudden then gradual because
[57:23] there is another appointment I have yeah
[57:25] so I'll be going and Maya is free to
[57:27] continue yes so will be leaving us
[57:31] unfortunately he has another appointment
[57:33] and we can uh continue the conversation
[57:35] amazing well good seeing you again thank
[57:38] you so much rim for for being
[57:42] on I I had one thing that uh I wanted to
[57:46] show Rahim about I think it's also
[57:47] really interesting uh because you said
[57:50] the uh smartphone and the tablet and I
[57:53] just want to show you that chart and and
[57:55] and one know what what you think about
[57:57] that um this actually a previous guest
[58:01] showed me this presentation where we
[58:04] actually yeah actually where we see the
[58:06] telephone how long it took electricity
[58:09] how long it took and then we see like
[58:11] the internet cell phones and this small
[58:15] small plip down here uh is is is is
[58:18] Bitcoin just starting out now uh and and
[58:22] this is really interesting of like okay
[58:23] what's possible actually when we have
[58:26] this technology improvements over time
[58:29] and it gets faster and faster seemingly
[58:31] but it's also an interesting to to see
[58:34] like okay the one thing is a protocol or
[58:37] but the other thing is a consumer or I'm
[58:40] that that's an interesting uh Point what
[58:43] what Rahim
[58:44] made how how do you look at uh those
[58:47] developments and how do you foresee the
[58:49] the Bitcoin growth and the Bitcoin
[58:51] adoption the coming years so I've I've
[58:53] seen this chart over the years and I
[58:56] even when uh I went to Oxford to lobby
[59:00] for our country to uh develop our
[59:04] Capital Market a new system you know
[59:06] with Bitcoin at its core uh this was one
[59:09] of the charts that they used in a
[59:11] presentation that was the chief
[59:12] compliance officer of Apple actually um
[59:15] chiali Roy giving that presentation and
[59:18] in her prese presentation she even said
[59:20] Bitcoin is dead first
[59:21] initially uh before I gave her like a
[59:24] two to three minute uh explanation on on
[59:27] why Bitcoin could never be dead um you
[59:30] know from from the whole process from
[59:33] mining um to met Cal's law Network
[59:36] effect right if you look at this chart
[59:39] and you look at how adoptions spread
[59:42] globally and how quickly technology
[59:44] develops it develops exponentially and
[59:47] spreads exponentially right and network
[59:50] effect also also spreads uh
[59:53] exponentially I think there is a shift
[59:56] as well in Bitcoin technology and and
[59:59] and the development of you know
[60:01] applications and certain use cases you
[60:03] have now for example RGB something that
[60:07] didn't exist five or six years ago that
[60:11] does exist now youve um you know a tap
[60:15] route that was enabled lightning now has
[60:18] uh has assets uh that increase um
[60:23] technologies that can be developed on
[60:24] top of it or um that where you can
[60:27] actually improve um certain assets that
[60:31] can be used using lightning so I think
[60:33] technology itself is is moving at a pace
[60:36] that
[60:37] is you know
[60:39] accelerating that will also accelerate
[60:42] adoption but I also think there is a
[60:45] certain moment of convergence right
[60:48] where new technologies are being
[60:51] developed on top of Bitcoin and I think
[60:53] a lot more Developers
[60:56] will pay attention to bitcoin and start
[60:59] developing more on on on the what should
[61:04] have gotten the most the most attention
[61:07] you know even since since uh ethereum
[61:10] got started there was most of the the
[61:13] the other blockchains or shitcoin chains
[61:16] that uh seem to be getting most of the
[61:19] developers um looking for for for profit
[61:23] more than they were actually looking for
[61:25] tech technology iCal advancement right
[61:28] so I do believe that go
[61:30] ahead I was just wanted I wanted to ask
[61:34] you about what do you think about chv M
[61:37] and Donald Trump and Milan Trump the
[61:38] coins that they launching it's so it's
[61:41] so frustrating for
[61:43] me so there you can see that you know
[61:46] they
[61:47] haven't they haven't been in the
[61:49] industry long enough or they don't
[61:52] really understand the technology or the
[61:54] difference between
[61:56] the two to them it's just yes but Ledger
[61:59] technology is going to be contined to to
[62:02] develop or blockchain technology is is
[62:05] they don't understand that one is
[62:08] something that cannot be replicated
[62:11] right anything that is
[62:13] centralized should just be a database
[62:16] and it's just VC paperware so they don't
[62:19] understand stand the the the difference
[62:22] between the two which I think is wider
[62:25] and and they're doing something that
[62:27] some advisor or some kid or um some
[62:30] developer is telling them to do because
[62:32] it's the next best thing or it's an easy
[62:35] way to to um attract Capital you know I
[62:39] could have launched the meme coin a
[62:43] thousand times over we have a technology
[62:45] development company I have a team I
[62:47] could have done an Ico in 2017 2018 I we
[62:52] had all of the the resources to be able
[62:55] ble to I could have done any of that you
[62:59] know uh we were in negotiations with
[63:01] binance to to to buy The Exchange we
[63:04] could I could have made a ton of stupid
[63:07] decisions over the past
[63:09] decade uh even building on hadera uh
[63:12] building uh dataless Labs you know for
[63:15] the last uh two years hadera offered us
[63:19] 10 million in a grant in funding you
[63:21] know to to develop on on on
[63:24] hia and I de and I I lost a good friend
[63:28] in the process and and a good
[63:31] relationship with my professor because I
[63:34] I didn't want to
[63:36] um I didn't want to diverge from the PA
[63:40] the path right because even if it's even
[63:42] if you say you take 10 million and you
[63:44] use half a million or a million to build
[63:46] on on hadera and the rest to build on
[63:48] bitcoin it would have still had its
[63:51] restrictions money doesn't
[63:53] come I mean we know that the main
[63:56] problem is money right now right money
[63:59] and greed which has gotten us where we
[64:02] are right now and I think the whole
[64:04] world realizes at at different levels
[64:08] right because corruption is it's
[64:10] ingrained and embedded into the
[64:12] traditional system the traditional
[64:15] Financial system but I just view it as
[64:17] the like the old
[64:19] system because it's it's in it's in
[64:21] everything it's in war it's in in in
[64:24] drug trade it's in human trafficking
[64:25] tring it's in Immigration it's the the
[64:29] the the problems that the world has
[64:31] right now are all they all they all
[64:35] somewhere come from from the financial
[64:38] system or or or money as as it has been
[64:40] and and government and governance as it
[64:43] has been right and Bitcoin changes the
[64:46] way we view governance and and
[64:50] centralization and and
[64:53] power and and the moment you
[64:56] you change from
[64:59] from Fiat thinking or and even in the
[65:01] industry I noticed there are a lot of
[65:03] people that still think very Fiat or are
[65:06] very you know interested in number go up
[65:09] I
[65:10] remember um it was I think 2015 in in
[65:15] whale poool and there's one of the
[65:19] admins of whale pools called SJ s
[65:22] AJ and he would constantly say you know
[65:25] the Fiat price doesn't matter um it's
[65:29] irrelevant right and and it is
[65:32] irrelevant because one Bitcoin will
[65:34] always be one Bitcoin and it feels like
[65:36] not everybody understands that but
[65:38] that's fine I mean we're early and even
[65:41] in the industry you're you're early if
[65:43] you actually do understand that and I
[65:45] think you also should um you know if you
[65:49] if you completely live on bitcoin you
[65:51] start earning in Bitcoin and you no
[65:55] longer
[65:56] longer care about income in Fiat or you
[65:59] no longer care about price or the amount
[66:03] of dollars that comes in or flows out or
[66:06] it all just doesn't matter in relation
[66:10] to you know your saving in what is
[66:13] eternity money right it's it's it's it's
[66:18] numbers on a chain but it's so much more
[66:20] than that so I I I think it changes the
[66:23] way you view the world and
[66:26] there over the the last couple of years
[66:28] I've I've realized that not everybody
[66:31] will understand and not everybody thinks
[66:34] the same way not even in the industry as
[66:36] I expected over the last couple of years
[66:39] and I think I was speaking to I think it
[66:42] was yes it was Jeff boo a couple of
[66:45] weeks ago two weeks ago I think and I
[66:47] keep asking him if I'm
[66:50] crazy sometimes I feel crazy I I I keep
[66:54] asking him like am I crazy because is
[66:56] this you know is this
[66:59] um is this is this actually possible is
[67:03] this rational because everybody else is
[67:05] talking about number go up and everybody
[67:08] actually cares about you know Bitcoin
[67:10] Reserve strategies I think Bitcoin
[67:12] Reserve strategies are are the opposite
[67:15] of what we wanted right if I if I think
[67:19] about um 10 years ago in in in in wh
[67:22] poool you didn't want government to have
[67:24] more power
[67:26] so adding a Bitcoin Reserve strategy to
[67:29] the mix isn't that contrary to what we
[67:31] want because that way government is
[67:33] getting more power and you're putting
[67:35] centralization um more into the hands of
[67:38] one leader
[67:41] versus you know relinquishing government
[67:44] control and government government power
[67:45] and making it more decentralized and I
[67:47] think this is where where Rahim and I
[67:50] especially you know he's the
[67:52] realist and I'm I'm the the
[67:56] ideologist I think and and
[67:58] and I don't know
[68:01] V I have these Visions or this this view
[68:05] of even 10 you know to 2018 when I said
[68:08] Bitcoin is just money in 10 years it
[68:10] will just be
[68:11] money um even the best in the industry
[68:16] still don't think that it is or can be
[68:19] money actually because you know there's
[68:21] no real adoption of it as money yet but
[68:26] Arthur laugher just said in an interview
[68:29] with Kathy Wood uh the Bitcoin
[68:32] brainstorm he says a government just has
[68:34] to accept it as money and actually it
[68:37] has to be money right so it feels like
[68:39] for over a decade everything has been
[68:42] aligning to where where we are going and
[68:46] where we're at in in this country and
[68:48] everything seems
[68:50] oddly like it like it is meant to be and
[68:53] like it is just happening so
[68:57] I really still believe that a Bitcoin
[69:00] Reserve strategy is not the strategy I
[69:03] don't think that giving a government
[69:06] more power more ways to print more money
[69:10] and more ways to increase its its um its
[69:15] control over its people is a way
[69:18] to um increase Bitcoin adoption in or of
[69:22] a country I still truly believe that it
[69:27] should be separation of money and state
[69:30] right so completely giving over control
[69:33] and it
[69:35] is look it has its risks right that's
[69:39] that rahim's constantly pointing out the
[69:40] risks me and you can't force and you
[69:43] can't do this and you can't do that or
[69:44] you know that but literally what has the
[69:48] cames dollar given us look at the chart
[69:51] look at the chart of the tunami dollar
[69:53] 50 to 60% inflation right it if you if
[69:57] you have weekly um weekly fluctuations
[70:01] we as a
[70:02] cames when people come here like Charlie
[70:05] from Bitcoin Berlin was just here and
[70:07] he's he's completely he calls me at 12 I
[70:09] think or 12:30 at night he's like Maya
[70:12] how do you live like this how can you
[70:14] live like this this is unfair and I'm
[70:16] like Welcome to My Reality Charlie right
[70:19] he's realizing that you have to you have
[70:21] to to spend 4% extra if you want to
[70:24] deposit money in the bank
[70:25] Bank uh you can't use a credit card just
[70:28] everywhere you can just go to an ATM and
[70:31] get money out of an ATM and to him it
[70:34] seems for and it seems strange and to me
[70:37] that is just how it's been and and how
[70:39] we live and you can't use payment
[70:41] processors there's no online payments
[70:43] it's it's it's just the reality here so
[70:46] I think our reality is something that is
[70:52] it's it's going
[70:53] to exactly look at it's devastating
[70:56] looks like a cliff so if you're used to
[71:00] living with
[71:02] volatility like that you know it's it's
[71:06] it's different you look at you look you
[71:08] look at money you look at Living from a
[71:10] different perspective so if I look at at
[71:13] Bitcoin as being money I see the
[71:16] opposite opposite of that chart right it
[71:18] it'll fluctuate in in in relation to
[71:23] foreign currencies but our own Nation
[71:25] currency over time will be worth more
[71:29] right people they're they they won't be
[71:32] seeing their in their their their their
[71:36] their savings disappear they won't be
[71:39] seeing their pension going from you know
[71:44] $1,000 to now
[71:46] $50 they'll be seeing an increase over
[71:49] time it'll be the the best performing
[71:54] currency or income situation in the
[71:56] world I think uh everyone in the rest of
[71:58] the world that wants to earn in Bitcoin
[72:00] will come to suram and that will attract
[72:02] a lot of talent and create a lot of
[72:03] production and a lot of
[72:06] prosperity and I don't know there's not
[72:09] many people that tend to agree with me
[72:11] or many people that
[72:14] um understand it in the same way or see
[72:17] it in the same way but that's the beauty
[72:18] of Bitcoin
[72:19] right it it is for
[72:22] everyone and I am fighting an uphill
[72:24] battle here it's not easy know being in
[72:27] the media for example I was just in the
[72:29] media for two police officers appearing
[72:32] at my front door and it's it's I have I
[72:38] I have people I know that are in jail
[72:42] and in Surinam you are guilty until
[72:45] proven innocent so the president can put
[72:49] you in jail and you will stay there for
[72:52] a year or two years and the fact that
[72:55] they can't find evidence is actually the
[72:58] reason that you'll be staying there
[73:00] longer until you
[73:03] comply right so I went to the media
[73:05] immediately the moment it happened and
[73:08] it went viral it's gotten over 61,000
[73:12] views so the entire country has seen it
[73:15] and that has saved me um but it doesn't
[73:20] come without its risk so I have a quite
[73:25] challenging way of of moving forward
[73:29] most of the world also doesn't even
[73:32] understand our political system right
[73:33] because they relate to the US system so
[73:36] they don't understand how why have you
[73:38] not been campaigning for two years I
[73:40] haven't been campaigning campaigning for
[73:42] two years because I one I haven't been a
[73:44] politician for two years so I've been in
[73:46] the media
[73:47] for for the the stock exchange I've been
[73:50] in the media about Bitcoin you know i' I
[73:52] have not been in the media as a
[73:54] politician
[73:56] uh except for the last couple of months
[73:58] so now I'm in the media and I'm getting
[74:01] the most traction but the there the
[74:04] campaign itself for
[74:07] example political party parties are only
[74:09] just starting and you don't campaign you
[74:12] know you don't put flyers or Billboards
[74:15] up and
[74:16] say me for president you campaign on on
[74:20] the party and you do you go out and you
[74:23] talk to people and you talk at rallies
[74:25] and you talk in the media and you don't
[74:27] say myf for president constantly right
[74:30] it's it's different that people hate
[74:32] that here I hate that when people do
[74:35] that I hate doing it and even as a you
[74:38] know it it doesn't feel right either but
[74:41] even even the chairman in my political
[74:43] party doesn't even do it they they say
[74:46] and you say if the people want me to if
[74:51] the people elect me to if the people
[74:54] give me me the authority to right and
[74:59] campaigns only start a couple of months
[75:02] before the
[75:03] elections candidates for Parliament and
[75:08] a president is elected in Parliament are
[75:11] only announced on March 25th so that is
[75:14] officially on March 25th and that's when
[75:16] everybody starts campaigning for
[75:18] themselves for more votes to get into
[75:21] Parliament and then seven members of
[75:23] parliament have to put you forward as a
[75:26] presidential candidate and then it's the
[75:29] the people with you know inherently the
[75:30] most votes of course that get put
[75:33] forward and it's a completely different
[75:35] system than you know from Europe or or
[75:39] the US and even now we have a new
[75:43] constitution where it's one man one vote
[75:45] which changes the Dynamics completely
[75:47] and I've done multiple podcasts on this
[75:49] this trying to explain it to the rest of
[75:51] the world but you only understand the
[75:52] world from your perception right
[75:55] so even me just running here I have a
[75:58] really G great team same team that uh
[76:01] supported the opposition in Venezuela so
[76:06] I am very proud of that you know at
[76:09] least I have a strong team supporting me
[76:12] and that gives me
[76:14] Comfort um but yeah it is it is it is
[76:18] it's just like how I how I believe in
[76:22] Bitcoin I I don't
[76:25] we do Grassroots
[76:27] adoption I've you know I have multiple
[76:30] projects that when people like Charlie
[76:33] came here and he hears this like hey
[76:35] this is what we have to do we have to do
[76:37] this and I've been telling him yes I've
[76:39] been having to do this for a year and a
[76:42] half right and convincing Bitcoin
[76:45] companies to actually support having to
[76:47] do this is difficult when all they care
[76:51] about is Fiat income right all they care
[76:55] about is making a profit they don't care
[76:57] about
[76:58] adoption and that's 98% of companies in
[77:02] this space they care about um the
[77:05] numbers of viewers they can attract to a
[77:07] certain tweet I'm sorry but I love my
[77:10] community and I love you know bitcoiners
[77:13] but I couldn't give less of a about
[77:18] Bitcoin Twitter to be honest like I love
[77:20] the people and I appreciate the support
[77:23] but if tomorrow I was cancelled and
[77:26] nobody followed me anymore seriously
[77:28] right Bitcoin doesn't care money bager
[77:31] doesn't care like I can continue to do
[77:33] what I do I if you don't get support for
[77:39] a year and a half to do simple projects
[77:41] in this country and then then I'm
[77:42] talking about adoption of a remote
[77:44] Village that uses gold right now to
[77:47] trade right and changing that from gold
[77:50] to
[77:51] bitcoin if you can't get support for
[77:54] people that I actually want it because
[77:56] they want it they they've asked for it
[77:59] but I don't have the the the team here
[78:01] or the technical
[78:02] skills you know it to actually roll it
[78:06] out now we are now we are I I I'll be
[78:09] completely honest now we are getting a
[78:10] lot more support um Bitcoin Beach Mike
[78:13] and Charlie from Bitcoin Berlin they are
[78:16] all amazing they they are helping now
[78:19] but for a year and a half I I I was
[78:22] coming on to podcast talking about these
[78:24] things po in it on on X and you know if
[78:28] if constantly dealing with with new new
[78:31] companies new people and a lot of
[78:34] prominent names in this industry a lot
[78:36] of prom prominent companies in this
[78:38] industry and if there's no
[78:41] dollar increase then it doesn't matter
[78:45] how much adoption happens if there's not
[78:48] a significant amount of profit to be
[78:50] made in
[78:52] dollars if there's no yet value or
[78:56] significant return Then adoption doesn't
[78:59] matter so and it doesn't matter if it's
[79:02] low cost right they they spend more at a
[79:04] Bitcoin conference than they spend than
[79:07] they would spend on doing adoption or
[79:09] don't don't send money to do the project
[79:12] send people send send send a project
[79:15] manager or send someone that actually
[79:18] has tried and tested this out in a
[79:20] different market and can bring it here I
[79:23] I mean I don't care it's not like I'm
[79:25] earning something off of it so it it
[79:29] it's it's um I don't know it's it's it's
[79:31] challenging on both sides it's
[79:33] challenging in the Bitcoin industry it's
[79:35] challenging you know I I didn't I'm not
[79:38] going ten conferences this year I'm not
[79:40] speaking in any conferences this year I
[79:42] spoke at almost all of them last year
[79:45] and I it has helped in some sense or
[79:48] well no no even last year I I reduced it
[79:51] a lot it it has some impact
[79:55] but then again not really as
[79:57] well you know not for what
[80:00] matters not for
[80:03] helping with a a decentralized solution
[80:07] to to healthcare Bitcoin um bit pooling
[80:10] Bitcoin for for insurance for example
[80:13] for the community that's an alternative
[80:15] to healthare or actually just adoption
[80:17] for a small village so that 5 to 6,000
[80:20] people right so that they can use it or
[80:22] NFC cards for for event organ organizers
[80:25] here so that they can use it for a 100
[80:28] people at a time at one event a
[80:29] thousands thousands of people at a time
[80:32] at one event that doesn't
[80:34] matter even to the developers of those
[80:37] things
[80:37] so it's
[80:40] um it's difficult to to see that that
[80:43] curve of
[80:45] adoption happen if not even the
[80:48] companies developing that technology
[80:51] actually care about it getting adopted
[80:54] like that right so I think similarly to
[80:56] to internet you have pets.com
[80:59] right pets.com
[81:02] over finan
[81:04] overfunded
[81:06] wasn't that was not the the best use of
[81:09] the technology or the the most
[81:12] beneficial to people you actually have
[81:14] to solve a problem and there are not a
[81:17] lot of companies in this space actually
[81:20] solving a problem for people or they're
[81:23] trying to solve it in a market where it
[81:25] isn't even a problem and you have so
[81:26] much Legacy income and financial
[81:28] infrastructure that they don't even care
[81:29] because they can just Apple pay instead
[81:33] so it's a challenge and on every front
[81:36] right but uh if it was easy everybody
[81:40] would be doing it I think don't you
[81:42] think absolutely it's uh it's
[81:47] the it's the harders of the industry but
[81:50] also the genius of Bitcoin of aligning
[81:52] incentive like people's still work all
[81:55] in Bitcoin even though there's no
[81:58] one there's no one that is saying like
[82:01] oh we have to do resources now there
[82:03] that that's the that's a beauty and
[82:05] still the hard thing of it like because
[82:06] we could say like oh like if we if
[82:08] Bitcoin is a company and there's like a
[82:10] CEO or something like that that would
[82:13] would be
[82:14] very would be very dangerous uh but
[82:17] let's let's make the good example of
[82:19] like there's a CEO that really cares
[82:21] about those adoptions he's like okay
[82:23] let's let's send a few people there
[82:24] let's send a few a little bit money
[82:26] there but it's not the case because it's
[82:28] all decentralized and everyone is kind
[82:29] of uh in the
[82:32] community but still on its own like
[82:34] there's not a uh there's not a social uh
[82:38] not a contract that binds someone to get
[82:40] it just a social contract um which is
[82:43] the beauty of Bitcoin and uh the magic
[82:46] of it even being possible after 156
[82:48] years uh being here and being stronger
[82:51] uh and this is kind of for me it's still
[82:55] unbelievable that it's that this is
[82:58] happening right now like this do do we
[83:00] actually having Bitcoin and it's working
[83:02] and presidents are talking about it uh
[83:04] and uh there's so much Grassroots
[83:06] movement happening and uh I actually can
[83:09] buy my my in Vienna in my restaurant I
[83:12] can buy food with Bitcoin like that
[83:15] that's it's just amazing for me um but
[83:19] it also has this disadvantages of like
[83:21] okay M maybe things are um maybe things
[83:25] are not as coordinated and we see this
[83:27] in crypto actually we see this in crypto
[83:29] where sometimes they are better in
[83:31] marketing sometimes they are better in
[83:33] in driving a project forward and
[83:37] and they they will be worse of the long
[83:40] run but short ter they have um uh some
[83:43] some advantages being centralized to
[83:45] organized uh but yeah there's a lot of
[83:48] things in the Bitcoin Community we like
[83:51] oh like okay because if you look at who
[83:53] who makes money Bitcoin it's uh largely
[83:57] exchanges and exchanges uh exchanges and
[84:00] uh miners those are the big companies
[84:02] usually and some of the hardware uh um
[84:06] companies that do it uh and then there
[84:08] are podcasters also make money about
[84:11] different different tier of of of money
[84:13] uh but uh yeah like it's a difficult
[84:17] thing of like where do you distribute
[84:19] those those resources and and what is
[84:21] incentive to do people have and then
[84:23] you're like do do they care about the
[84:25] feeld income or do they care about the
[84:27] adoption and it's it's it
[84:31] shows yeah I think
[84:34] um I think we've really
[84:36] been slacking or I wouldn't say failed
[84:40] because you know it's still we're still
[84:42] ongoing it's still young but you yeah
[84:46] you're you're right in that regard like
[84:49] shitcoin companies have been better at
[84:52] collaborating as a community you know
[84:55] versus how we actually have been
[84:57] collaborating I I see it
[85:00] improving you know you can see
[85:02] improvements now more than than it has
[85:05] been in the past
[85:07] but I think that there's still a lot of
[85:10] room for improvement there where we can
[85:13] actually collaborate and work more
[85:17] towards a common goal versus competing
[85:20] with each other or thinking that it's
[85:22] competition because
[85:25] I don't know
[85:26] like why would adoption of Bitcoin in in
[85:30] suram for example be competition to
[85:34] anyone wouldn't it
[85:36] improve other countries other other
[85:40] nations that have already adopted it
[85:43] wouldn't it
[85:44] improve you know the business model of
[85:47] of most of the comp the companies in the
[85:49] industry wouldn't they fix a lot of
[85:51] issues um
[85:54] have another country where you don't
[85:56] have a president that creates a
[85:59] coin um I don't know I think I think you
[86:02] know Max Kaiser has been screaming the
[86:04] do dominoes are going to fall since I
[86:06] think uh I was standing in front of him
[86:09] and when he was being interviewed by
[86:11] CNBC I think it was uh the Miami
[86:15] blockchain Conference in
[86:18] 2018 and you know he's been screaming it
[86:21] I think since then and isn't it time to
[86:24] topple those dominoes over and why
[86:26] wouldn't be we be working together to do
[86:29] it like why would
[86:30] you come here and try
[86:35] to like I don't I don't get people
[86:38] trying to sway me over with money either
[86:42] it's
[86:43] like if if if I were corruptible by some
[86:47] investment to do one person's bidding
[86:52] right or push one person's agenda
[86:55] then I could be bought by anyone and I
[86:58] think that it makes it more challenging
[87:01] because it does make it harder to to to
[87:04] raise funds to to run a campaign
[87:07] but I have a great team right now and I
[87:10] didn't have to compromise my Integrity
[87:12] so sometimes the road this is a lot more
[87:15] difficult
[87:16] but it's yeah I I don't know it there's
[87:19] a lot in the space that that we can
[87:21] improve and I think it's you know it's
[87:23] discussion like these where you and I
[87:25] just talk and we talk openly and we just
[87:28] talk about our experiences and and our
[87:31] struggles and what is good and what is
[87:34] bad and what is great because there's a
[87:35] lot that I love as well the fact that
[87:38] it's decentralized I could could be
[87:40] completely alone on the planet and you
[87:43] know find another Bitcoin or somewhere
[87:45] else in the world
[87:46] and still still have some
[87:50] someone um that is likeminded and
[87:53] understands
[87:55] you know so there's there's there's a
[87:57] beauty to it and it brings people
[87:58] together as well but there's there's
[88:01] some things that need changing that or
[88:06] could be better right it doesn't need
[88:09] anything like people people will be
[88:12] people I think the advice two weeks ago
[88:14] by Jeff boo was uh 90% of people will
[88:20] cheat right it's human nature so or two
[88:23] and a half half% might not 10% might not
[88:27] and just move forward with those that do
[88:32] not and all I can do is be the best that
[88:35] I am and and try the best that I can
[88:38] and
[88:40] see you know give it my best shot this
[88:43] may and leading up to
[88:45] May and hope for the
[88:49] best and even if I don't get elected
[88:54] there's still Grassroots adoption
[88:56] happening so they can't stop me there so
[88:59] I feel like either way you know it's
[89:02] happening seram is getting there either
[89:04] way and I'm not going to stop
[89:08] so either way serum will Inc adoption
[89:13] will
[89:14] increase it will take off more and more
[89:16] here and I will be pushing for it
[89:18] advocating for it I have been for almost
[89:21] the last decade so I see no reason why I
[89:24] would sh would stop at this
[89:27] point
[89:29] um so yeah honey bger doesn't give
[89:32] we keep going whether elections or not
[89:34] I'm not a politician you know
[89:36] so if I don't win I'll keep going but I
[89:42] have faith that because the people are
[89:44] so tired of corruption and they want
[89:46] change and in the existing system the
[89:49] existing leadership you you don't have
[89:52] it and
[89:54] I am fighting for what is important to
[89:57] the people you know I'm fighting for our
[90:00] health care System right now for the
[90:02] hospitals I'm helping fund raise for
[90:04] that not in the Bitcoin space but I'm
[90:07] helping fund raise for them we're
[90:09] organizing events
[90:11] fundraisers to help solve critical
[90:13] issues at um at hospitals I'm fighting
[90:17] to just we're feeding orphanages you
[90:21] know we're doing things that are
[90:24] different to how anyone would
[90:25] traditionally
[90:27] campaign aside from traditionally
[90:29] campaigning so I do think that people
[90:32] see that change and support is
[90:35] increasing and as as you know the
[90:38] campaign ramps up especially at the end
[90:40] of March that you will see significant
[90:43] increases
[90:45] in yeah how people think about what the
[90:49] what you know what can actually happen
[90:51] here I'm not selling hope I'm selling
[90:53] hey look this has actually happened in
[90:54] El Salvador we can do this this has
[90:57] actually happened in Switzerland we can
[90:59] do this
[91:01] the Constitution we need to change it
[91:05] we've been waiting since 1987 if we keep
[91:08] waiting we're going to keep waiting so
[91:09] we have to do something so I'm fighting
[91:13] for the things that
[91:15] matter and I think that's different as
[91:17] well which is why I'm getting more and
[91:19] more
[91:20] support and those that you know those
[91:24] that support join and those that
[91:27] don't they're still stuck in the old
[91:30] system
[91:31] and it's not my job to get them out of
[91:33] it I think that's why you're you're so
[91:35] popular because you so real and so uh
[91:40] transparent with with things and uh
[91:42] you're you're not trying to be liked by
[91:45] anyone you're just trying to be yourself
[91:47] and I think that's something uh uh super
[91:50] attractive uh in uh like for people it's
[91:55] like wow like I I I look up to that
[91:57] because most people are afraid to be
[91:58] themselves I feel like they really like
[92:00] the they they they they don't want that
[92:03] they they cannot get out of a v like I
[92:06] was I'm still maybe a little bit like
[92:09] that but especially two years before I
[92:11] started the podcast now I'm like okay I
[92:12] can find myself like I have the podcast
[92:15] and and I don't need a company I can get
[92:18] rid of the sponsors even and I would be
[92:20] fine um uh and this liberates you a
[92:23] little bit
[92:24] uh and but before you you have an
[92:27] employee or like you you're in some
[92:28] social structure or like you you are in
[92:31] some system and you're like oh like can
[92:33] I say that like like maybe I think twice
[92:36] before I say something it just obviously
[92:40] and so I think this is what resonates
[92:42] with people with with your message and
[92:44] with your
[92:45] mission yeah you know
[92:48] um they tried like I had a campaign c
[92:52] campaign manager that really wanted me
[92:54] to be you know more like yes in the Ard
[92:58] or more polished more um you know more
[93:02] in a
[93:04] suit I I don't know I I think I think
[93:08] we're done with with with old politics
[93:11] and and old politicians at least I am
[93:13] right and and what you say I I I think
[93:16] it's important to realize that we're all
[93:18] human like I'm not perfect I I I also
[93:21] make mistakes and
[93:25] I I try to to do what's best right you
[93:30] you all you can do is is maintain your
[93:33] your principles your integrity your
[93:35] values and give it the best shot you can
[93:38] and perform as as good as you can and I
[93:41] can't do any more than that you know I I
[93:43] also have my own
[93:45] health my
[93:47] baby to to think about
[93:51] um so I think yeah I I I do like to to
[93:55] to just be honest and I mean if if
[93:59] anyone has a question I I I'm happy to
[94:02] to to answer it and I don't mind
[94:04] answering it publicly either have
[94:06] nothing to hide
[94:08] so I think maybe the the fact that I'm
[94:11] not a a dieh hard politician or that
[94:14] I've even I wasn't even a politician
[94:17] before a couple of months ago helps you
[94:20] know it's not in my nature so that that
[94:23] probably helps yeah I am who I am with
[94:26] baby sorry to ask but are you pregnant
[94:29] or like what did you mean with baby I'm
[94:31] pregnant oh I didn't know you
[94:33] congratulations
[94:34] [Laughter]
[94:37] sorry yes I'm I'm there's a little bit
[94:41] Corner
[94:42] coming nice uh uh when are you
[94:46] du uh early
[94:49] May
[94:51] soon yes
[94:54] congratulations really
[94:56] cool thank you may and also around the
[95:00] elections if I'm
[95:03] right
[95:06] yes good good good good
[95:09] timing perfect timing to be honest you
[95:13] know uh uncle uncle always says you have
[95:16] to pick the hard way don't you why do
[95:18] you always have to pick the hard
[95:22] way yeah like uh the election itself is
[95:25] is already a big challenge but then yeah
[95:27] like let's get a baby in exactly that
[95:29] [Laughter]
[95:32] timing well you know it's been done it's
[95:35] been done before I'm not the first woman
[95:37] to to give birth a couple of weeks for
[95:41] the before the elections uh
[95:45] yes you know I'm not a I'm not a big fan
[95:47] of everything but um at least that she
[95:51] was able to do it so
[95:54] I have a good example of uh that it is
[95:58] it is
[95:59] possible absolutely really cool um we
[96:02] have a question that I asked each and
[96:03] every one of my guests and the question
[96:05] is uh what can we learn from you besides
[96:08] Bitcoin you
[96:10] know after 21 years of being an
[96:14] entrepreneur I've recently relinquished
[96:17] control of of all my companies because
[96:20] as a as a a politic here running for for
[96:25] president in particular um you know I
[96:29] have announced that I'm running for
[96:31] president you're not allowed to have
[96:33] income from companies so no no dividends
[96:36] no uh no salaries anymore so I've I'm
[96:41] transitioning out out of my my companies
[96:44] all of them
[96:45] and you know I've I've learned over the
[96:48] past 21
[96:50] years being an entrepreneur isn't
[96:54] easy with working a job isn't easy
[96:58] either um it's all a challenge and
[97:02] building a business is is even harder
[97:05] and keeping a business running for 21
[97:07] years or or a decade with my second
[97:09] company especially one at scale um isn't
[97:14] easy
[97:16] either but I think perseverance is key
[97:20] and I think that is something that I'm
[97:22] well known for I don't get give up I
[97:24] don't know how to quit even even when I
[97:27] quit I don't know how to quit right I
[97:30] quit and then I I I still go on the next
[97:32] day so if there's anyone anything I I
[97:36] can can teach anyone it would
[97:39] be there is power in in in not giving up
[97:44] and there's there is power in in
[97:45] persevering and staying the course
[97:48] following your north northern star as Dr
[97:51] laugher would say
[97:54] um so especially in these hard times
[97:56] when there's so many distractions and so
[97:58] many issues that you know everybody
[98:00] wants you to focus
[98:02] on
[98:04] um stay through to your Northern Star
[98:07] and keep focusing on your vision and
[98:09] your goal you know once you've set it
[98:13] longterm and I I do set long-term goals
[98:16] it's always 10 10 years in Into the
[98:18] Future 20 years into into the future 50
[98:21] years into the future um that I write
[98:24] out keep following that path because
[98:27] eventually you get there and and I can
[98:30] speak to that from 20 years 21 years of
[98:33] experience it may take longer than you
[98:35] think it may be harder than you think it
[98:37] may be harder or more challenging than
[98:39] you anticipated but if you keep
[98:42] following eventually you will get
[98:44] there so that would be my advice I love
[98:48] that it's really really cool um wow we
[98:53] have an end in the podcast um we haven't
[98:56] done it last time because the internet
[98:57] connection broke down uh but we can do
[99:00] it now uh the previous guest in this
[99:03] case Ben from PDC session actually was
[99:05] the previous guest he asked you so like
[99:08] the previous guest is asking a question
[99:09] for the next guest without knowing who
[99:10] the next guest really is and he asked
[99:13] you without knowing who who you uh who
[99:15] the next guest is what technical skill
[99:18] do you want uh to learn next hm that's a
[99:23] good question what technical skill do I
[99:26] want to learn next well I honestly I'm
[99:28] very much interested in
[99:30] RGB I've looked at it uh now where
[99:33] there's more documentation available
[99:35] online so I've looked at the developer
[99:38] documentation and uh what's available
[99:41] for building it my team's already
[99:42] working on it but those are experienced
[99:44] developers they they they didn't code
[99:47] for the last time 20 years ago so that I
[99:50] I I want to take a deeper dive into RGB
[99:54] actually if I had free time right now or
[99:56] actually maybe I should just make some
[99:57] free time um I'd want to learn more
[100:00] about that because it seems like it's
[100:02] something I've been waiting a decade for
[100:05] and now it's here so I'm very excited
[100:08] about that I love that really cool yeah
[100:11] time isn't uh time doesn't come down has
[100:15] to be

[102:43] here we need to figure it out there is a
[102:45] way there is a way you know and and you
[102:48] need to look at the economy and in so
[102:50] many angles so it's a very challenging
[102:51] but quite interesting
[102:54] uh problem to figure out a solution for
[102:55] it so it was fun to do that with him
[102:58] here um I'll be making his life
[103:01] miserable for the next couple of months
[103:03] to figure it out as well so uh no I I
