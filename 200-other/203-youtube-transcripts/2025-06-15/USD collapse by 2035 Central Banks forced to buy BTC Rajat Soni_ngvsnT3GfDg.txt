[00:00] it could take one cycle to get $2
[00:01] million why would you sell your Bitcoin
[00:03] it doesn't really make sense to get rid
[00:05] of your Bitcoin your pristine asset in
[00:07] order to buy something like real estate
[00:09] we could easily see the US dollar
[00:11] collapse by 2035 90% of people aren't
[00:14] going to have adopted Bitcoin by the
[00:16] time it's at a million dollar a lot more
[00:18] companies a lot more investors prominent
[00:20] investors are going to wrap their heads
[00:22] around Bitcoin they're going to try
[00:23] looking at it they're going to figure it
[00:24] out and they're going to get their
[00:25] companies to buy it or they're going to
[00:27] buy it for themselves I think cbdc are
[00:28] going to come they're going to flop not
[00:30] going to do as well as governments think
[00:31] they will central banks think they will
[00:33] and they're going to be forced into
[00:34] buying Bitcoin all roads lead to bitcoin
[00:36] cbdcs are going to eventually lead to
[00:38] bitcoin when people see that oh my money
[00:39] is being cancelled after 6 months or I'm
[00:42] getting a negative yield on my savings
[00:44] why would they want to continue holding
[00:45] their cbdc once there's 10% adoption the
[00:49] other 90% are going to adopt very quick
[00:51] you don't need to buy real estate
[00:52] because on a Bitcoin standard house
[00:53] prices will continue to go down
[00:55] [Music]
[00:58] forever Frieza about you what you have
[01:01] been up to the the last few months where
[01:03] you have not been on my channel so I've
[01:06] seen that you actually made a YouTube
[01:07] channel and that you are actually
[01:09] leveling up your uh Bitcoin education
[01:12] game you have the Twitter I think the
[01:14] Instagram you also have and now you also
[01:15] have a YouTube channel where there's a
[01:17] lot of great stuff there um what what's
[01:20] what's been like the last few months
[01:22] where you have not been on the channel
[01:23] what there some of your highlights
[01:24] personally and maybe also in Bitcoin
[01:26] honestly um part of the reason why I
[01:28] even made the channel was because of
[01:31] because of our because of our L our last
[01:33] podcast the last uh conversation that we
[01:36] had every conversation obviously it
[01:38] gives you it it leaves you with
[01:40] something I feel like our every
[01:42] conversation is very valuable I feel
[01:43] like our conversation really gave me
[01:44] that that push but I've been working a
[01:47] lot on uh educating myself learning more
[01:51] um reading more books uh I I read a
[01:56] couple of books I read um I read the
[01:59] internet of money back there I don't
[02:01] know if you can see it but it's back
[02:02] there um and I I've been just exploring
[02:05] deeper going going as far as I can I
[02:07] actually uh I used to post only uh I
[02:12] used to post Bitcoin content on my
[02:13] Instagram but now I separated them as
[02:15] well so a lot of tweaks going on a lot
[02:17] of small changes there uh massive
[02:20] changes going going forward too though
[02:21] so amazing I love it a lot and I I
[02:25] stumbled around your channel and I was
[02:26] like let's let's see what are the
[02:28] popular videos there and I think there's
[02:30] one video that really stood out to me
[02:34] and the title was I I have it here most
[02:36] people will ignore Bitcoin till it's
[02:38] reached 1 million or something like that
[02:40] it was uh and it was fascinating for me
[02:42] because when when we think about 1
[02:44] million there's a lot of money coming in
[02:46] there uh and also there's a lot of
[02:48] attention like when you think when you
[02:50] think about the attention that Bitcoin
[02:52] got when it reached over 10,000 and then
[02:54] it shot shot up to like 18,000 or
[02:56] something like that at 2017 a lot of
[02:59] people already talked about it we did
[03:01] not have that in 2021 I feel like that
[03:03] really big talking point um why do you
[03:07] think that most people will ignore it or
[03:09] like uh what what how do you define most
[03:12] people is it like 80% or
[03:14] 50% I would say uh I think 90% of people
[03:19] aren't going to have adopted Bitcoin by
[03:21] the time it's at a million dollars 90%
[03:23] of people are going to be forced into it
[03:25] cuz you have I mean it's like everything
[03:27] else right it's like every other asset
[03:28] 10% will own
[03:30] 90% of the asset it's like the par
[03:32] principle 20% own
[03:34] 80% uh the top 20% have 80% of the
[03:38] production or the top 20 C top 20
[03:41] customers out of 100 will give you most
[03:42] of your sales it's the same thing right
[03:44] the top 1% will own 99% of the Bitcoin
[03:49] top 90% will own uh sorry top 10% will
[03:53] own 90% of the Bitcoin top uh the the
[03:56] rest that 90% will the 10% and I don't I
[03:59] think it'll be even lower than that
[04:00] actually I think it'll be lower than 10%
[04:02] just because as the later you get the
[04:05] more coins are being locked away and
[04:07] they'll never come back to the economy
[04:09] again right both of us have our own
[04:11] Stacks you've had conversations with
[04:13] tons of people a lot of these people are
[04:16] V very educated on how Bitcoin works and
[04:19] why would you sell your Bitcoin unless
[04:22] you have something better uh I I kind of
[04:26] uh Dove a little deeper with micro
[04:28] strategy you had a great convers ation
[04:30] with uh with Michael saor by the way um
[04:32] I dove a little deeper into that I feel
[04:34] like maybe that's micro strategy and
[04:36] maybe another company that can print
[04:38] Bitcoin they're the only ones who may be
[04:41] worth investing in instead of Bitcoin
[04:45] right over time it doesn't really make
[04:47] sense to get rid of your Bitcoin your
[04:50] pristine asset in order to buy something
[04:52] like real estate where you have to rent
[04:55] it out where you have real estate values
[04:57] are going to decrease significantly over
[04:59] time right and I mean over time you can
[05:01] you can see that pretty easily so yeah
[05:04] it's it's uh it's so obvious when when
[05:06] you go deeper that um but let's focus a
[05:09] little bit on that one million uh it's
[05:12] it seems like when you really research
[05:15] Bitcoin H for me it's feels like 1
[05:18] million is easily reachable it's not
[05:20] that far away um when you already see
[05:23] like okay there's Michael Salen he's now
[05:25] kind of orange ping Michael Dell and
[05:28] this is just like one small example we
[05:30] don't know how many behind the scenes
[05:32] talks maybe even like Larry think has
[05:35] with really big companies or like other
[05:37] people have that we don't even know
[05:38] about who is our o ogs and don't want to
[05:40] be on the surface H like there are a lot
[05:42] of things that we don't know about who
[05:44] can really bring billions into Bitcoin
[05:46] will really drive up the price without
[05:50] any Mass uh adoption without any uh
[05:53] really retail adoption how do you think
[05:56] uh we get to this this 1 million uh
[05:58] thing is just like more of of the same
[06:00] that we have now uh we have thef thef is
[06:03] probably still going like it's it's just
[06:06] a starting of of that how do you imagine
[06:08] like to this one million price point I
[06:11] think uh I mean you've probably seen the
[06:14] tweets from Michael Dell where he's
[06:16] talking about Bitcoin um I actually
[06:19] wrote a thread about this today where a
[06:22] lot more companies a lot more investors
[06:25] prominent investors are going to wrap
[06:27] their heads around Bitcoin they're going
[06:28] to try looking at it they're going to
[06:30] figure it out and they're going to get
[06:31] their companies to buy it or they're
[06:33] going to buy it for themselves Michael
[06:34] Dell has $15 billion or something like
[06:37] that of his own and he's he's what the
[06:40] CEO the founder of Dell right and he can
[06:44] easily his goal is to earn his
[06:48] shareholders as much profit as possible
[06:50] as much as high returns as possible and
[06:53] he he gets a benefit out of that because
[06:54] he owns stock options he owns shares um
[06:58] so he benefits from it if he sees that
[07:02] micro strategy is tripling quadrupling
[07:05] 10 Xing in price then why wouldn't he
[07:08] follow the same strategy that micro
[07:10] strategy is following it doesn't really
[07:11] make any sense not to uh after I think
[07:14] after
[07:15] Dell once Dell actually starts to
[07:17] because Michael Dell on his own has what
[07:19] eight something like I was actually
[07:20] looking at his page today he has like
[07:22] 800,000 Subs uh followers so even if all
[07:26] of the people that are following him or
[07:29] the people that you've had on your
[07:31] podcast if all these people buy even a
[07:34] fraction of Bitcoin price is going to
[07:35] increase significantly because over time
[07:38] there's less coins available on
[07:39] exchanges there's less available to be
[07:41] bought um the the amounts that are the
[07:45] amounts that are available at the
[07:46] current prices are going to keep
[07:49] decreasing over time they're going to
[07:50] keep decreasing but the thing is that
[07:51] with Bitcoin you can buy fractions you
[07:54] can buy tiny tiny fractions if you want
[07:55] to so even if you buy one cent worth if
[07:58] you want to buy one worth if you want to
[08:00] buy one Nigerian naira's worth you can
[08:03] you can't do that with any other asset
[08:04] you can't do that with real estate you
[08:06] can't do that with stocks also there's
[08:08] the fact that um all these other asset
[08:11] classes real estate is worth $400
[08:13] trillion there are people who own
[08:15] hundreds or even thousands of properties
[08:17] if they even sell a fraction of their
[08:19] properties and they put it into Bitcoin
[08:21] we could see the price increase
[08:23] significantly right um and I think
[08:25] that's what's going to happen I think
[08:26] most people will keep ignoring Bitcoin I
[08:28] think most very very wealthy investors
[08:31] will continue to ignore Bitcoin until it
[08:33] reaches $100,000 and then at $100,000
[08:35] they're going to start studying it
[08:37] they're going to put a small fraction of
[08:38] their wealth into it and as they do that
[08:41] the fomo Rises fomo keeps increasing
[08:44] keeps increasing until we see aund I
[08:46] think it could take one cycle to get to
[08:48] a million dollar because from zero to
[08:51] 70,000 it's much harder it's much harder
[08:54] to start from zero 0 to 1 is much harder
[08:56] than it is to go from 1 to 10 or 1 to
[08:59] 100 100 right even when we start both
[09:02] when you started your YouTube channel
[09:03] you probably noticed it's harder for you
[09:05] to go from zero to 100 subscribers than
[09:07] it is to go from 5,000 to 6,000 right
[09:11] and you use you recently hit that but
[09:12] you you notice you notice that because
[09:14] that's just how compounding work so
[09:16] exactly the same thing with Bitcoin
[09:17] we're going to see um more and more
[09:20] people right now I think something like
[09:22] maximum of 5% of the world's population
[09:25] owns Bitcoin this 5% I I think it's
[09:29] significantly less than that most people
[09:30] don't understand it a lot of the people
[09:33] who own Bitcoin today are going to sell
[09:35] it they're going to sell early because
[09:36] they don't truly understand it so
[09:37] they're going to be part of the people
[09:39] who I guess lost out um but over time
[09:42] we're going to see that more and more
[09:45] people pile into it more and more people
[09:47] have 3040 $50,000 set aside they can
[09:50] just put all of it into it the ETFs has
[09:51] made it a lot easier and we're going to
[09:53] see that PR I I think we could see a
[09:55] million dollars by 2030 and I don't
[09:58] think by 2030 we're have 15 20% adoption
[10:02] yeah I think this this example is really
[10:04] good um just for context because you
[10:07] mentioned my podcast I needed one month
[10:10] to gain the first 20 subscribers like a
[10:13] whole month this is now what I get
[10:17] sometimes in an hour if if some video
[10:19] does good like when like when the Mich
[10:22] saor video was released I gained a
[10:25] thousand in like uh six days of five
[10:29] days or something like that like that
[10:31] that's are crazy like the compounding uh
[10:34] effects of like networking and stuff
[10:36] like that this is also for money and
[10:38] it's even more for money because money
[10:40] is like the most viral thing ever in our
[10:43] society uh and another thing that
[10:45] happens like when the price like you
[10:48] mentioned the 800,000 uh followers of of
[10:51] Michael Dell like not only if if this
[10:54] followers they they're buying something
[10:56] but he has a lot of buddies who also
[10:59] really really rich and have a lot of
[11:01] money and a lot of influence those are
[11:03] also influencing a lot of things and
[11:04] then when the price goes up all of a
[11:06] sudden the the Bitcoin content creators
[11:08] like a podcast like let's let's take
[11:10] this podcast for example uh when there's
[11:13] some uh pop star with like a million
[11:15] followers uh coming out and saying like
[11:17] oh Bitcoin is a thing and they want to
[11:18] be on a on bitcoin podcast and they're
[11:20] like oh let's see the five 10 best
[11:22] Bitcoin podcast and they're like hey
[11:24] contact them and they are on them of
[11:26] course this brings new people in like
[11:29] like this is a such an an amazing cycle
[11:31] from a social standpoint but also from a
[11:34] financial standpoint and uh yeah do you
[11:37] also think that 100,000 will will
[11:39] trigger a lot of this this this momentum
[11:42] I feel like 100,000 is like a thing a
[11:44] lot of people are waiting for to really
[11:47] make a huge impact in the societ it
[11:50] would be really interesting if we hit
[11:51] the 100,000 like Q end of Q3 something
[11:54] like that I'm I'm looking for for that
[11:56] kind of number yeah know that I think
[11:58] that I think that 100K will definitely
[12:01] um bring up some
[12:04] emotional investing it'll people will
[12:07] buy it because they're feeling emotional
[12:08] they they're feeling the fomo they're
[12:10] feeling the greed um but what I think
[12:13] what's going to happen is a lot of
[12:14] people are going to put let's say 1%
[12:17] towards
[12:19] Bitcoin uh at these prices for example
[12:22] and then at $100,000 they going to see
[12:24] oh this is not a joke maybe I should
[12:25] start learning more about this I think
[12:27] at $100,000 what's going to happen
[12:29] happen is a lot of people who are
[12:31] creating content are going to see their
[12:34] subscribers their videos blow up like
[12:37] crazy but
[12:39] then with it takes time to understand
[12:42] how Bitcoin works right you you don't go
[12:44] from let's say 1% to 100% overnight it
[12:49] takes a long long time it takes a very
[12:51] long time like for me it took like three
[12:54] years right it took me three years to
[12:56] sell my stocks up until I think August I
[13:00] I have a podcast I have a podcast with
[13:02] simply Bitcoin where uh I was talking
[13:05] about how real estate and Bitcoin don't
[13:07] compete they don't compete right now I
[13:11] created a video yesterday I just made a
[13:13] video yesterday that directly
[13:16] contradicts what I said in that last
[13:17] podcast because I figured it out I
[13:19] understood how it works and I think over
[13:21] time more and more people are going to
[13:23] see this but at that $100,000
[13:25] level it's going to open more people's
[13:27] eyes because right now they they see
[13:29] that oh it's five figures they think
[13:31] that 10,000 versus 990,000 is the same
[13:33] thing because it's still five figures
[13:34] right but when it hits six figures
[13:36] that's where that uh psychological
[13:38] impact happens and then at a million
[13:41] because what's going to happen is those
[13:42] people who are figuring it out at
[13:44] $100,000 they're going to buy those that
[13:46] 1% 2% I actually had a ton of people
[13:48] messaging me over the last few days uh
[13:51] because I've been posting about it
[13:53] regularly people telling me hey I
[13:55] started buying Bitcoin I wanted 60,000
[13:58] finally got it as I put I started my
[14:00] dollar cost average um more people are
[14:03] going to start doing that right people
[14:05] who I haven't touched people who your
[14:08] your podcast has touched over time
[14:10] you're you're probably uh how many views
[14:13] are you getting a month 100,000 200,000
[14:17] right think about it those 200,000
[14:19] whoever whoever's seeing those videos
[14:21] they're becoming more and more convicted
[14:23] every single video they watch every
[14:26] single video they see every single
[14:28] perspective every single opinion every
[14:30] single content creator has their own
[14:33] opinions to add all I think that's one
[14:35] of the important things about Bitcoin
[14:37] podcast right I I think the the
[14:39] important thing about some something
[14:40] like yours is that you have so many
[14:43] different people with different
[14:44] backgrounds on your conversations what
[14:46] Bitcoin did same thing Preston push same
[14:48] thing all these podcasts same thing but
[14:50] it's not it's not the same content I'm
[14:52] saying that the idea is that the more
[14:55] more people that you have exposure to
[14:57] the more people you can learn from the
[14:58] faster F you get to the end the faster
[15:01] you start accumulating to bitcoin I
[15:04] think having those different opinions
[15:05] because think about it there are a lot
[15:07] of people who can relate to me maybe
[15:09] they're Indian maybe they have the same
[15:10] background as me maybe they have a
[15:12] finance background maybe they're
[15:13] confused about Bitcoin same thing with a
[15:15] lot of your guests maybe there's people
[15:16] who are doing one thing or another they
[15:18] can relate to this guy this guy changed
[15:21] their opinion and now they're now
[15:22] they're a bitcoiner right it just
[15:24] happens over time as as more people
[15:27] understand it more content creators it
[15:29] compounds it it's going to keep
[15:30] compounding the network is going to keep
[15:32] growing it's going to keep getting
[15:33] bigger and in that in that time you also
[15:37] have to see that the US Dollars the US
[15:39] government is going to keep printing
[15:41] dollar borrowing dollars the Federal
[15:42] Reserve is going to keep printing
[15:44] dollars adding into the economy at some
[15:47] point I wouldn't be surprised if the
[15:49] Federal Reserve starts printing dollars
[15:51] to buy Bitcoin and I wouldn't be
[15:53] surprised if that happens before 90% of
[15:56] the mass the the public owns Bitcoin
[16:00] right and that's when we see that
[16:01] massive increase that's when we see that
[16:04] I don't know if we're gonna have an
[16:05] Omega candle I think they're smart
[16:06] enough to just do it over time but there
[16:08] could be something it's all Game Theory
[16:10] right somebody could come out you never
[16:12] know how what China is planning to do
[16:14] tomorrow what Russia is planning to do
[16:16] tomorrow um you you don't know what
[16:19] Japan's going to do what if Japan goes
[16:20] and sells all their treasuries because
[16:23] the yen
[16:24] is getting wrecked they sell all their
[16:27] treasuries they exchange it all for
[16:28] Bitcoin
[16:30] right they have something like a
[16:31] trillion dollars worth of treasuries if
[16:33] they did that what would happen to
[16:34] bitcoin it's not like bitcoin's price is
[16:36] going to double if they put a trillion
[16:38] dollars into Bitcoin right the bitcoin's
[16:39] price is going to 10x 15x because if
[16:42] they put it all in at
[16:44] once it changes everything it is is this
[16:47] the final straw that has to happen when
[16:50] uh central banks especially the big ones
[16:52] like the Federal Reserve the ECP are
[16:55] printing fat currencies to actually buy
[16:58] Bitcoin and put it on their balance
[16:59] sheet even if it's just 105% or
[17:02] something like that yeah I think that's
[17:04] probably going to happen after cbdcs I
[17:07] think cbdcs are going to come they're
[17:09] going to flop nobody's going to want to
[17:10] I mean people are I think there's always
[17:12] going to be a lot of people who end up
[17:13] using them but I have a feeling that
[17:16] they're not going to do as well as
[17:18] governments think they will central
[17:20] banks think they will and they're going
[17:22] to be forced into buying Bitcoin it's
[17:24] it's it's a common phrase right all all
[17:28] roads lead to bitcoin coin cbdcs are
[17:30] going to eventually lead to bitcoin when
[17:32] people see that oh uh my money is being
[17:35] cancelled after 6 months or I'm getting
[17:38] a negative yield on my savings why would
[17:41] they want to continue
[17:43] holding their cbdc and then again our
[17:46] podcasts our channels all the content
[17:49] that we're putting out all the content
[17:50] that everybody else is putting out Bram
[17:53] uh what's his name alesio um Fred Fred
[17:58] Krueger all the all this content it is
[18:00] just leading to one road right no matter
[18:04] how far out on the shitcoin route you
[18:06] are it always leads to
[18:09] bitcoin right it always leads to I I
[18:11] think uh even math you know Matthew
[18:13] Crowder Bitcoin University yeah Bitcoin
[18:16] yeah he posted a video today about Caspa
[18:19] uh how Caspa is a a shitcoin essentially
[18:23] and I hadn't done the Deep dive he did
[18:26] the Deep dive he did a great job on it
[18:27] and over time we're going to see more
[18:29] and more people calling out the scam
[18:31] coins right we're going to see this over
[18:33] time and more and more people will be
[18:36] forced into buying Bitcoin because
[18:38] nothing else is worth anything nothing
[18:40] else is worth buying a lot of people
[18:42] like I always encourage people to create
[18:44] content like uh every guest that comes
[18:47] on and he does not create content I'm
[18:49] like hey you have such a great voice go
[18:51] out and create content uh and I even
[18:53] inspired like right now fre people that
[18:57] actually are in the process of starting
[18:58] own podcast and starting their own
[19:00] congration Journey uh and a lot of
[19:03] people ask me then like like why are you
[19:05] doing that you're a greatting
[19:07] competition for yourself because there
[19:08] are other content creators and I don't
[19:10] see it that way I think we we have a a
[19:13] greater mission to do and I like to have
[19:16] as many soldiers on my side as possible
[19:19] like we we we in the same boat we are
[19:23] all doing the same thing if if other
[19:27] Bitcoin podcasts get more views we we
[19:29] all gain from that and that's the great
[19:31] thing with with Bitcoin voices and
[19:32] that's like I always try to push as many
[19:35] Bitcoin voices as possible I have 10 or
[19:38] 15% of my guests are people that never
[19:40] have been on any podcast before like not
[19:43] not on any podcast I reached out to a
[19:46] subscriber who leaves great comments and
[19:49] said to him hey I would love to get your
[19:52] perspective on the podcast and he was
[19:55] amazing I loved it us because he he
[19:58] really left like that much of comments
[20:00] like on every second video or something
[20:02] like that I was like he has such
[20:04] insights I want to get him on the
[20:05] podcast I I want to Trav with him and it
[20:08] wasn't a great podcast and that's why
[20:10] I'm really bullish on uh what you just
[20:12] said and I wanted to highlight that with
[20:13] like getting more voices out there
[20:15] because he is someone uh uh that someone
[20:20] else relates to because if I only have
[20:22] like the same 50 people over and over
[20:26] again on my podcast uh this is just like
[20:29] a how can you say like we're only in a
[20:32] bubble and we never expand outside and
[20:34] never get new voices so I always will
[20:36] have uh round twos with people like with
[20:39] you now and round three with people but
[20:41] I always want to have completely new
[20:44] people on my podcast because this first
[20:47] like expands my my view but this leads
[20:50] to bitcoin adoption because when we get
[20:51] new voices out there this this creates
[20:55] something uh even if it's a Michael S in
[20:57] 2020 he became a popular new voice or
[21:01] someone else on a smaller scale like
[21:03] that's that's amazing because uh we are
[21:05] on a mission here and then I love that a
[21:07] lot that uh that we can do this all
[21:09] together and and spread Bitcoin as Micha
[21:11] saor says it with love and not not hate
[21:15] oh yeah I I feel like um I feel like
[21:17] thinking of it as as competition isn't
[21:19] the right way I think a lot of people
[21:21] think of it that way but that's not the
[21:22] right way I like how you think of it I
[21:24] actually feel like uh if you tell people
[21:27] to create content it actually makes your
[21:30] content do even better
[21:32] because when there's more people who are
[21:35] talking about Bitcoin they get
[21:36] recommended to people in their feeds and
[21:38] then when they get recommended in their
[21:40] feeds the Al I mean the YouTube
[21:43] algorithm is smart enough to know that
[21:45] this person likes this person's content
[21:48] so maybe we'll push this maybe we'll
[21:50] push Rob's content
[21:52] to this person maybe we'll push it to to
[21:55] this Mutual connection so I I feel like
[21:56] it just the network just gets bigger
[21:58] right it's not like anybody loses right
[22:01] as you as you increase the as you
[22:04] increase the the amount of content
[22:05] available on YouTube more and more
[22:07] people want to watch it more and more
[22:09] people get bored and they want to find
[22:11] new YouTube accounts that can talk to
[22:13] people and everybody has their own story
[22:16] everybody has their own skills everybody
[22:19] has their own perspective their own
[22:21] biases there's always GNA be somebody
[22:23] who can relate to you right there's
[22:24] always gonna be somebody there there's
[22:25] never going to be somebody who can't
[22:27] you're you're never I think that's the
[22:29] problem with with a lot of social media
[22:31] people think that oh I posted two three
[22:33] times why am I not going viral doesn't
[22:36] work that way uh like my first if you go
[22:40] through my old videos man they were
[22:42] terrible because I didn't know how to
[22:44] edit I didn't know how to I didn't know
[22:47] how to create a script I didn't know how
[22:48] to uh speak
[22:51] confidently my videos like I'm
[22:53] stuttering in half of videos It's it's
[22:55] so bad but then over time you get better
[22:57] you just get better over time as you get
[22:59] better more and more people want to see
[23:00] your content and like like like with
[23:02] what you did maybe out of those 10% 15%
[23:06] there's going to be somebody who creates
[23:08] the next what Bitcoin did and maybe they
[23:10] discover something brand new right they
[23:12] discover a brand new way of looking at
[23:14] Bitcoin and it changes more perspectives
[23:18] love it a lot um back to the the the one
[23:22] thing that I uh forgot before when we
[23:24] talked about bitcoin price um
[23:29] it it's it's price targets are always
[23:31] interesting for me because like one it's
[23:33] it's it's important I think to talk
[23:36] about a little bit because this is how
[23:39] people outside of Bitcoin measure the
[23:42] success of Bitcoin how how high the
[23:45] price goes and they also want to grasp
[23:48] the potential of Bitcoin in like 10
[23:51] years 20 years 50 years uh so bitcoin
[23:55] price is a tricky one for me because I
[23:57] myself I would not even know what I
[23:59] would sell for so why would I create a
[24:02] price Target but I also have in mind
[24:05] that I'm in a small bubble and 99.9% of
[24:09] the world wants to know what the price
[24:13] one day will be in Bitcoin even
[24:15] bitcoiners and that's why I think it's
[24:17] even important as a bitcoiner to talk
[24:19] about the US dollar because the US
[24:21] dollar is still the reality for most
[24:23] people and they are thinking about that
[24:25] even I live in Austria in in a Euro
[24:29] country and still US dollar is kind of
[24:32] seen as like the the main unit of
[24:34] account um what kind of price Target uh
[24:39] would you put on on Bitcoin in like
[24:41] really 20 years maybe 30 years outside
[24:44] of this 1 million prise Target so the
[24:46] way that I look at it I think um I think
[24:50] once there's 10%
[24:53] adoption n the the other 90% are going
[24:56] to adopt very quick because the 10% are
[24:58] going to adopt because they have certain
[25:00] incentives so let's say uh okay so let's
[25:04] say I bought uh the Bitcoin standard I
[25:06] thought I had it with me but let's say I
[25:07] bought the Bitcoin standard and I wanted
[25:09] to read this book and I'm buying it from
[25:12] safine am's uh publishing house and
[25:15] safine is giving me a discount for
[25:17] buying Bitcoin for buying with Bitcoin
[25:19] for paying with Bitcoin what that does
[25:22] is it saves him money for transaction
[25:24] fees and if I don't have Bitcoin already
[25:27] I'm going to buy Bitcoin to use it and
[25:28] I'm going to send it to him and he's
[25:30] probably never going to sell it again
[25:32] right so over time I think what what's
[25:34] going to happen is that 10% they're
[25:36] going to see the benefits of receiving
[25:39] Bitcoin as payments a lot of the I think
[25:41] a lot of the I think part of the reason
[25:44] why um a lot of bitcoiners are very
[25:48] productive is because they have that
[25:50] entrepreneurial mindset if you're an
[25:52] entrepreneur you're trying to decrease
[25:53] your costs right and part of decreasing
[25:56] costs as a business is to decrease the
[26:00] expenses that you have to pay for
[26:01] payment processing right so with with
[26:05] those first 10% I think what's going to
[26:07] happen is uh a lot of these people are
[26:09] going to be Merchants who are giving 5
[26:11] 10 15% discounts for buying products
[26:13] with Bitcoin because first of all they
[26:15] don't have to pay credit card fees
[26:18] secondly they don't have to invest the
[26:20] money so they can just get more money
[26:23] and then they can keep it in that in
[26:25] that form they can put it on a lightning
[26:27] wallet just leave it on lightning or
[26:28] they can uh move it from lightning after
[26:30] they get to a certain amount they can
[26:31] move it to their wallet and they have to
[26:32] pay that transaction fee once but that
[26:35] transaction fee is a flat fee they're
[26:37] not paying a percentage so that makes a
[26:39] massive difference I was actually uh I
[26:42] was looking into how much money Visa
[26:44] makes from uh from credit card
[26:47] processing Visa makes more in profits
[26:50] than Walmart right so when you think
[26:52] about that what does visa do Visa is
[26:55] literally just a uh a payment processor
[26:59] that's it they're datab exactly that's
[27:03] that's literally it they're all they're
[27:04] doing is they're uh helping us process
[27:08] transactions they're giving us a way to
[27:11] move our wealth from one place to the
[27:13] other so if you want to pay Amazon
[27:14] without Visa how would you do it you'd
[27:16] have to go to their head office you'd
[27:17] have to go to their uh headquarters to
[27:19] make a payment if you if we were using
[27:20] gold you'd have to go to their
[27:22] headquarters to give them that piece of
[27:24] gold because you can't send it over over
[27:26] the Bitcoin Network right so what's
[27:27] going to happen
[27:28] is I think payment Pro I think Merchants
[27:32] are going to see the benefits of this
[27:33] they're going to see the benefits of
[27:34] just getting Bitcoin not having to deal
[27:36] with all these payment processes a lot
[27:38] of people think that oh it's because
[27:39] they're trying to avoid taxes I don't
[27:41] think that I don't think that's it when
[27:42] you have when you have Bitcoin I think
[27:44] eventually at a point you're going to be
[27:45] so far in the green that you don't give
[27:47] a about taxes right taxes don't
[27:49] matter because that point you have so
[27:50] much money that you can live your life
[27:53] comfortably you can pay your taxes you
[27:55] can get the government off your back it
[27:56] doesn't really make a difference you're
[27:57] not going to try to avoid taxes if you
[27:59] have a a few hundred, dolls right or a
[28:03] few a few maybe a few million dollars
[28:05] you don't you don't care about taxes for
[28:06] a couple Bitcoin but I think what's
[28:08] that's what that's going to do is it's
[28:10] going to trigger a lot of people to buy
[28:15] Bitcoin to pay their favorite Merchant
[28:17] with
[28:18] it right and what that's going to do
[28:20] again is it's going to concentrate
[28:23] wealth with the people who are producing
[28:24] value and the people who continue to
[28:26] produce value over time and then those
[28:28] people like me and you uh if you have an
[28:31] employee for example and we're on a
[28:33] Bitcoin standard you're probably going
[28:34] to pay them with Bitcoin you're going to
[28:36] save your time you're going to use them
[28:37] to instead of editing your own videos
[28:39] maybe you're going to pay somebody to
[28:40] edit your videos instead of spending 10
[28:42] 20 hours to do it you're going to pay
[28:43] some editor a little bit of Bitcoin
[28:45] because of the value that they're giving
[28:46] you because of the time that they're
[28:47] saving you you're going to give them
[28:48] Bitcoin you're going to redistribute it
[28:50] that way I think that's what's going to
[28:51] happen
[28:53] and we're going to go from 10% to 90% to
[28:56] to maybe not 90 maybe like 70 80% very
[28:59] quickly I think we're it may take up
[29:02] until maybe 2030 to get to that
[29:05] 10% and then maybe 20 35 to get to 90% I
[29:09] don't know if that's going to happen
[29:10] let's see what happens could be
[29:12] completely different but price we we
[29:14] went into this tangent because of the
[29:15] price so I think by 2030 we could see a
[29:20] million but maybe I'm being too bullish
[29:23] here I don't know I mean there's a
[29:25] possibility that we could see a million
[29:26] by the end of 2024
[29:28] for all we know right nobody has any
[29:31] clue nobody knows how much Bitcoin will
[29:33] be on the market at
[29:35] 100K what if fewer people want to sell
[29:38] their Bitcoin at 100K than they want to
[29:39] do than they want to sell
[29:41] now right we don't know we don't know
[29:43] what the supply side is going to be like
[29:45] all we know is that new suppli is
[29:47] decreasing we know that the majority of
[29:49] people don't own any and we know that
[29:52] these people eventually will very likely
[29:55] have to own Bitcoin and if they don't
[29:58] they can't participate in the economy so
[30:02] with just those factors in mind I mean
[30:04] we could easily see the US dollar
[30:06] collapse
[30:07] by
[30:09] 2035 right I mean that could be way too
[30:11] bullish on bitcoin but then the thing is
[30:14] that once you understand how Bitcoin
[30:15] Works once you understand Game Theory
[30:17] once you understand how money Works once
[30:19] you understand the the economy once you
[30:22] understand price
[30:23] signals it's very difficult not to see
[30:26] it that way it's it's fascinating me
[30:28] when when we think about do do you think
[30:30] with when when you say the fear is
[30:32] collapsing are you saying we switching
[30:35] the whole system to bitcoin or the the
[30:38] Bitcoin price just vents up parabolic
[30:40] but we still use this to pay taxes the
[30:43] use dollars we we still uses the US
[30:45] dollar as a currency I don't honestly I
[30:47] don't think the US government is going
[30:49] to want to take US dollars in taxes it
[30:52] won't make sense for them right why
[30:54] would they I mean I mean this seems so
[30:57] abstract it seems so crazy it doesn't
[30:58] even seem like it's a real like we're
[31:00] having a we're talking about a real
[31:02] future here to most people they don't
[31:03] even think of it that way right but if
[31:06] you I I've I've been I've actually been
[31:08] thinking about this for for a while now
[31:10] but why would it make sense for the US
[31:12] government to keep getting taxes in US
[31:15] dollars if the rest of the world is
[31:17] saving if all the other central banks
[31:19] are saving in
[31:22] Bitcoin why wouldn't they want to get
[31:24] that wealth it's like the um
[31:28] I forgot gresham's law is that what it
[31:30] is good money chases out bad
[31:33] money money or something like that but
[31:36] basically the bad money is being used
[31:38] people are getting rid of it as quickly
[31:40] as possible and the good money is being
[31:42] hoarded it's being stored so the US
[31:44] government has that power they have that
[31:47] Monopoly over violence where they can
[31:49] force people to pay in Bitcoin they can
[31:52] threaten them with violence they can say
[31:53] if you don't pay your taxes in Bitcoin
[31:55] we don't want dollars anymore if you
[31:57] don't pay P your taxes in Bitcoin then
[31:59] we don't we don't accept accept your
[32:00] payment right because at that point
[32:02] maybe dollars will be worthless like I
[32:04] said this could be such an a a crazy
[32:07] abstract situation maybe it's not even
[32:09] going to happen this way maybe it's not
[32:10] even going to be close to this but I
[32:12] mean there's there's always a
[32:14] possibility right there's a possibility
[32:16] that the US government adopts Bitcoin
[32:19] just to avoid giving bricks any steam
[32:24] right any any of that compounding like
[32:25] we're talking about compounding the
[32:28] the reason why we even use a currency is
[32:31] because everybody else uses it if the US
[32:34] government keeps printing they keep
[32:36] printing maybe they're maybe they are
[32:37] this arrogant who knows maybe maybe they
[32:39] do think that they're the only ones who
[32:41] can create that that world Reserve
[32:42] currency but they keep printing keep
[32:44] printing they're giving more people an
[32:45] incentive to move move to something else
[32:48] they're probably not going to push
[32:50] bricks why would they push a currency of
[32:53] a country that or not country countries
[32:56] that are directly competing with them so
[32:58] to them I think because Bitcoin is that
[33:00] neutral currency we're going to see the
[33:02] US government adopt Bitcoin much sooner
[33:05] than people expect people think that
[33:07] Bitcoin is going to get banned by the US
[33:08] government but but that doesn't really
[33:10] make any sense because I feel like the
[33:11] US government has smart enough people on
[33:13] its
[33:14] payroll that they will figure out what
[33:16] Bitcoin is and maybe maybe this election
[33:19] will will be the trigger for that how do
[33:21] you see the the election to be the dgg
[33:24] of that it's possible yeah yeah yeah
[33:26] it's possible it's definitely possible
[33:27] as if uh there's a lot of people who are
[33:31] single issue voters right A lot of
[33:33] people I'm not American I know you're
[33:34] not American uh a lot of people who are
[33:38] in America they understand Bitcoin and
[33:39] they're only going to vote for whoever
[33:42] wants to wants to promote Bitcoin right
[33:46] and they're not going to vote for the
[33:48] other party if there's one party that's
[33:51] completely against Bitcoin and the other
[33:53] party is completely for Bitcoin they're
[33:55] obviously going to vote for the people
[33:57] who are for it and apparently there's
[33:58] something like 50 million people in the
[33:59] US who own Bitcoin or who are in
[34:02] cryptocurrencies who own
[34:03] cryptocurrencies and that's 50 that's
[34:06] what maybe
[34:07] 20% maybe more than 20% of the voting
[34:11] population yeah I think they have like
[34:14] 300 million population is that wrong but
[34:19] there also under under 18 who can't vote
[34:22] people like people just people in
[34:23] general who can't vote but then that's
[34:25] like 20 30% of the voting population
[34:29] right that's crazy like when when you
[34:30] put it in that perspective like like you
[34:32] said 300 million so we let's say we get
[34:34] rid of 20% for people who can't vote uh
[34:37] 240 million 50 million out of 240
[34:40] million that's like 23 22% thank you you
[34:43] already made it halfway through the
[34:45] video and I'm really really grateful to
[34:47] have you here two things make this
[34:49] channel possible you as a watcher and
[34:52] listener who keep supporting this
[34:54] Channel and another one is all the
[34:56] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[34:58] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[35:01] very start and where I personally buy my
[35:03] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[35:05] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[35:07] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[35:10] simplest and securest way to secure your
[35:13] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[35:16] only 2% of bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin
[35:19] in a hardware wallet how crazy is that
[35:21] don't be in that 98% bracket be in the
[35:24] 2% bracket and if you have self- custody
[35:27] and you're your friend does not have
[35:29] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[35:30] he needs a birthday present and a small
[35:32] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[35:35] 5% off your order plus you support my
[35:38] channel and now let's get back to the
[35:40] video I just Googled
[35:42] 244 million Americans probably will be
[35:45] eligible for vote to uh for this for
[35:48] this election and uh usually that's also
[35:51] one thing usually uh oh no no this is
[35:54] something else but then like from from
[35:56] those uh 20 44 not everyone going to is
[35:59] going to vote so if you really can Mo
[36:01] mobilize bitcoiners who who have Bitcoin
[36:04] or have crypto to say like hey I'm that
[36:07] Pro Bitcoin and crypto candidate if you
[36:09] want to uh have that in the politics you
[36:12] have to votee for me and you have to
[36:13] vote also you really like this is a
[36:16] major power if you have this 50 million
[36:18] voters and of course of those 50 million
[36:21] people not everyone the number one
[36:23] priority is Bitcoin but if you actually
[36:27] have Bitcoin and you get Bitcoin then
[36:28] Bitcoin is like for me single issue
[36:30] voter I am Austria and there's actually
[36:33] Austrian election coming up in September
[36:36] uh I mean it's so small like nobody in
[36:38] the world gu about AUST because it's
[36:40] really small but there is no real party
[36:42] for Bitcoin like I read all the
[36:46] political parties but there there's not
[36:48] really one in there but for what you
[36:51] said before this was also really
[36:52] interesting um when you said about Game
[36:55] Theory and and us will not push the
[36:57] bricks because this will be the major
[37:00] advantage of Bitcoin because us is not
[37:03] trusting anyone else and like in general
[37:07] trust is not so much there between
[37:09] countries we see with so many wars when
[37:11] we see Russia Ukraine when we see other
[37:14] countries there's not too many trusts
[37:16] inside even in in even inside of the
[37:19] European Union there's so much conflicts
[37:21] happening and so much tension between
[37:23] those countries that are in the same
[37:25] Union so when nobody trusts each other
[37:30] what what are they going to choose
[37:31] something that they don't have to trust
[37:33] it's like that that makes so much sense
[37:36] yeah it's money for enemies right it's
[37:38] money when people say oh why are you
[37:40] supporting Black Rock uh buying Bitcoin
[37:44] it's because we understand that this is
[37:45] money for everyone you can't stop Black
[37:48] Rock from owning Bitcoin you can't stop
[37:51] the wealthiest people in the world from
[37:52] owning Bitcoin all you can do is buy it
[37:55] yourself you can't you can't uh prevent
[37:58] somebody else from buying a Bitcoin all
[38:00] you can do somebody I don't know who
[38:01] said this but you can only ban yourself
[38:03] from buying Bitcoin You Can't Ban
[38:05] anybody else it's not my quote but great
[38:07] quote excellent quote because it makes a
[38:09] lot of sense right you can't stop
[38:11] someone from memorizing 12 words if
[38:14] somebody wants to own
[38:15] Bitcoin they can own it if they want to
[38:18] memorize these 12 or 24 words they can
[38:20] do it nobody can stop them nobody can
[38:23] prevent them from doing that you talked
[38:25] before that uh in the beginning of the
[38:28] podcast about that you uh had the
[38:31] opinion that Bitcoin is not competing
[38:33] with real estate but then you changed it
[38:35] and you had the podcast interview with
[38:37] or the podcast with simply Bitcoin TV
[38:40] what what changed it what made you think
[38:42] like oh Bitcoin is actually sucking up
[38:43] the financial energy of everything why
[38:47] why is the value lost in in real estate
[38:49] and stocks and other uh things wise
[38:51] Bitcoin they are so Superior and what
[38:53] made you change that
[38:55] opinion so I used to work at as a uh as
[38:58] a realtor I used to work as a as a real
[39:00] estate agent um I I used to work so I
[39:03] used to work at UH TD uh TD Bank as a
[39:06] bond analyst I hated that job so I left
[39:10] it uh I wanted to see what you can do as
[39:12] I thought I was a good salesperson I
[39:14] thought I'd find it interesting so I
[39:15] thought okay maybe I'll do real estate
[39:16] so I started selling real estate but I
[39:17] realized that a lot of Realtors don't
[39:20] actually know why their customers are
[39:23] buying real estate they have no idea
[39:25] right so they're telling these people
[39:27] that oh you can buy this property I've
[39:29] heard conversations with uh Realtors
[39:32] like well-known Realtors and their
[39:34] customers they've told them oh the
[39:36] property value is going to go up no
[39:37] matter what it's going to go up forever
[39:40] it's going to keep going you're always
[39:41] going to be able to get rent you're
[39:43] there's always going to be some sucker
[39:44] out there who's willing to pay you three
[39:46] four five 10 15 $20,000 whatever the
[39:48] rent is at the time there's always going
[39:50] to be somebody out there that can do
[39:51] that
[39:52] but uh I think once you zoom out once
[39:54] you really look at what they're doing
[39:58] you see that's a Ponzi
[40:00] scheme right it's pretty easy to see and
[40:03] the Ponzi scheme uh the bottom layer of
[40:05] that Ponzi scheme the uh the bottom
[40:08] layer of that Ponzi scheme is renters
[40:10] above that is landlords above that is
[40:14] Banks and above that is government
[40:17] government is earning property taxes so
[40:18] they want property values to go up banks
[40:21] are earning interest and they can give
[40:23] out bigger loans so they want property
[40:25] values to go up landlords
[40:28] uh want property values to go up so they
[40:29] make more money but then at the bottom
[40:33] there's people who are renting those
[40:35] properties they can't buy the property
[40:37] so what they're doing is they're renting
[40:38] the properties they're paying whatever
[40:39] the rent the market rental rate is and
[40:41] eventually those people won't be able to
[40:43] afford it anymore it's just you can't
[40:47] you can't increase minimum wage by 2% a
[40:51] year when rent is going up 12 13 15% a
[40:55] year so all these people people what if
[40:58] I don't know if you've noticed this
[40:59] trend but there's a lot more people who
[41:00] are camping in their
[41:02] cars they can't afford to buy a house
[41:04] they can't afford to pay rent because
[41:07] they don't want to work in they don't
[41:08] want to work 80 hours to pay for rent
[41:11] when they can just live in their car
[41:12] they can live a minimalist life I know
[41:14] they're not doing it by choice but thing
[41:16] is that they're doing it and what this
[41:18] is going to do is it's going to make
[41:19] more and more people want to avoid
[41:22] having to pay rent because rent is
[41:24] killing their lives it's taking their
[41:26] entire life away right
[41:27] and what I see is so the the main thing
[41:31] that I see here is that real estate
[41:33] prices are going to decrease because the
[41:36] only reason why you have to buy real
[41:38] estate is because the US dollar doesn't
[41:40] work once the US dollar is
[41:42] replaced you can use Bitcoin as a
[41:46] savings tool you don't need real estate
[41:48] anymore you know you don't need to buy
[41:50] real estate because on a Bitcoin
[41:52] standard house prices will continue to
[41:53] go down forever uh I don't know if you
[41:55] want to maybe you can share the price in
[41:57] Bitcoin 21 um you know the price in
[42:00] Bitcoin 21 the charts uh bit the Bitcoin
[42:03] price was in 21 or what yeah yeah so
[42:06] actually let me share it let me share it
[42:08] I'll I'll share it quickly it's the
[42:10] actually let me send you it's this
[42:12] priced in Bitcoin 21 I don't know if
[42:14] you've seen this website so priced in
[42:15] Bitcoin 21 you can actually use this for
[42:17] a lot of your your content maybe a lot
[42:19] of I don't know if you've seen this
[42:20] before but basically shows you the
[42:21] prices for everything so the price of a
[42:24] house in terms of US Dollars has
[42:26] decreased by
[42:28] 99.9% right and if you own that house a
[42:32] house was worth in 2011 a house was
[42:35] worth
[42:36] 64,000 Bitcoin today that same house is
[42:40] worth seven Bitcoin regardless of how
[42:42] much rent you got regardless of how much
[42:45] uh tax benefits you got regardless of
[42:47] how many tax breaks you got from owning
[42:49] that real estate you're never going to
[42:51] be able to get back 64,000
[42:55] Bitcoin I I think you I think you're
[42:59] muted oh sorry is that that
[43:02] website this is
[43:04] it go uh uh go to yeah housing yeah and
[43:09] then you can see UK housing and then you
[43:11] can see us so if you go to
[43:13] us and then you just hit all at the top
[43:16] there and change the at the bottom you
[43:19] see those orange uh those orange tabs
[43:21] just change it from SATs to turn that
[43:23] off just so it's a little easier to see
[43:26] but now if if you go to August 2011 so
[43:29] right at the beginning of this
[43:32] chart uh and then go to the line hover
[43:34] over yeah there you go so you can see
[43:35] here 26,000 Bitcoin for one
[43:38] house if you go if you go a little bit
[43:41] further to the to the right just go to
[43:43] the very top there uh move to the sorry
[43:46] move to the move to the
[43:49] left oh sorry you're left move to the
[43:51] right that's what I should have
[43:53] said okay what what whatever it is but
[43:56] at a point a house who was worth 64,000
[44:01] Bitcoin at the very top there yeah yeah
[44:03] right there 64,000 Bitcoin that's
[44:07] crazy right and now there's a lot of
[44:09] people who are arguing oh you can get
[44:11] tax benefits um you can get rental
[44:15] income cash flow whatever the whatever
[44:18] the excuses are but the rental income
[44:21] the cash flow the tax benefits are not
[44:24] going to get you to the 64,000 Bitcoin
[44:27] that you could have had right so right
[44:29] now one house costs 6.8
[44:33] Bitcoin I was doing the calculations on
[44:35] this there's something like 150 million
[44:37] houses in the
[44:39] US and out of those 100 million or 150
[44:42] million 10% are
[44:46] unoccupied meaning if if somebody sold
[44:50] if those 10% of houses were sold for
[44:53] Bitcoin what would happen to the price
[44:55] of Housing and what would happen to the
[44:56] price of of
[44:57] Bitcoin price of Bitcoin would Skyrocket
[45:01] price of housing would drop like crazy
[45:03] because like I said there's 15 million
[45:06] unoccupied houses just in the US but
[45:08] then there's also 2.4 billion houses in
[45:11] the entire world and right now you can
[45:14] barely find a place where you can buy a
[45:15] house for less than one
[45:17] Bitcoin if this is the global money if
[45:20] this is the form of money for the entire
[45:22] world why would you want to hold real
[45:24] estate that I think that's just putting
[45:27] all that together why would you want to
[45:28] hold something that's going to
[45:29] depreciate what why would you want to
[45:31] hold something that you know is going to
[45:33] decrease in value over time is it you
[45:36] you said uh renters are on the downside
[45:40] of of the pyramid but it's still better
[45:43] to own actual Bitcoin so you would also
[45:45] suggest to like just pay rent uh if you
[45:48] have the choice like there might be a
[45:50] lot of people in the audience who like
[45:52] well I would have the financial means to
[45:54] go ahead and buy a house for for myself
[45:56] just to use it or an apartment uh but I
[46:00] rather pay the rent and Own 100% of of
[46:04] my Bitcoin and and be all in would you
[46:07] also Suess that or would you even go
[46:08] ahead okay like your own house you can
[46:10] own but the majority of your netork
[46:13] should be in
[46:14] Bitcoin I personally I personally own my
[46:17] own house so I can't tell people to that
[46:19] they should rent I think it's more of a
[46:21] personal uh decision so if somebody
[46:23] wants if somebody feels like renting is
[46:25] right for them they should rent if some
[46:27] feels like uh owning is right for them
[46:29] but event but you know for a fact that
[46:31] the value of your house is going to
[46:33] decrease over time so if if it were me
[46:35] if I were to do it again if I knew about
[46:37] Bitcoin because we bought this house in
[46:39] like 2019 or something like that um but
[46:42] if I were to do it again if I knew about
[46:44] Bitcoin back then maybe Bitcoin would
[46:45] have been my choice and maybe I would
[46:48] have been able to
[46:49] buy uh instead of buying this house buy
[46:52] 20 Bitcoin right and then that 20
[46:56] Bitcoin
[46:57] is now worth 10x what the house is worth
[47:01] and I can just pay off the house I can
[47:03] just buy the house I can just buy it out
[47:04] right for maybe 10 or five Bitcoin or
[47:08] something like
[47:09] that get get a loan against the house
[47:11] and buy Bitcoin and then uh with with
[47:14] one tenth of the Bitcoin get get the
[47:16] house back there you go that see that
[47:19] works too exactly however you do it I I
[47:21] feel like it I feel like everybody has
[47:23] their own risk tolerance like if you're
[47:25] okay with taking that risk
[47:27] then that's smart I don't know if most
[47:30] people are willing to take that risk
[47:31] that's the only thing I think housing is
[47:33] great uh if you're using it as a primary
[47:35] residence because you have some
[47:37] stability right you know for a fact that
[47:39] your cost of living won't increase
[47:41] dramatically overnight um on the other
[47:43] hand a rent a landlord could increase
[47:46] your rent give you 60 days notice 90
[47:48] days notice tell you you have to pay
[47:50] $400 more or you're out and if you can't
[47:54] afford that $400 what are you going to
[47:56] do yeah
[47:57] right it's it's it's so it's so easy
[47:59] than you think about it yeah and then I
[48:02] think one of the other things is when we
[48:04] use housing as uh as an investment
[48:08] anybody who's
[48:09] renting their cost of living is
[48:13] proportionately with needs and wants
[48:16] their cost of living is their their cost
[48:18] of living going towards their needs
[48:19] their Necessities so they can't even
[48:21] enjoy life right more of their income is
[48:23] going towards their needs meaning that
[48:25] let's say if your rent up 20% but your
[48:28] income only went up by 2% you have to
[48:30] cut something out there's something that
[48:32] you have to cut out what is it that
[48:34] you're going to cut out you're going to
[48:35] cut out entertainment are you going to
[48:36] cut out healthy foods are you going to
[48:38] start eating processed junk are you
[48:41] going to get rid of
[48:44] um what you what do you can get rid of
[48:46] that's that's pretty much it right you
[48:47] have to get rid of entertainment there's
[48:48] something you have to cut out but then
[48:50] on the other side of it the people who
[48:52] own these houses they're able to
[48:57] excessively be entertained excessively
[49:00] consume right so I think the once once
[49:04] you just put the pieces together you see
[49:06] that housing being an
[49:08] investment is one of the main reasons
[49:11] for the wealth Gap right it sounds crazy
[49:14] it it sounds absolutely insane to
[49:16] somebody who doesn't understand Bitcoin
[49:18] to somebody who hasn't seen Bitcoin from
[49:20] this lens from but for somebody who just
[49:22] sees the world from that us lens it
[49:24] sounds just nuts it it's it sounds like
[49:27] you're just insane but then once you
[49:30] study it it's like okay it makes a lot
[49:33] of sense I fully agreed do do you see a
[49:35] risk that um
[49:38] the and we have now only a small amount
[49:41] of people actually in Bitcoin and then
[49:44] even smaller amount of people have a lot
[49:47] of Bitcoin I mean a significant amount
[49:50] of their own net worth in Bitcoin uh
[49:52] it's like a really small amount I feel
[49:54] like um do you see a risk where
[49:57] the there's a smaller group of people
[50:00] have a lot of wealth in the future and
[50:03] those will be the New Elites and the new
[50:06] uh kind of what we are now uh seeing
[50:09] that's bad black rock and all those
[50:11] things like do you feel like that at
[50:13] some point bitcoiners will be that at
[50:15] lead and that a new revolutionary group
[50:17] is fighting against that or is is wild
[50:20] because we have now Fair money and it's
[50:22] not a pyramid scheme it's not it's it's
[50:24] proof of work and not proof of stake uh
[50:26] that that this actually is is
[50:29] changing I think there's a difference um
[50:32] so when Black Rock owns all of these
[50:34] stocks when it owns these stocks for on
[50:36] behalf of its customers Black Rock can
[50:40] vote on things it can choose to invest
[50:43] in certain companies I think there was I
[50:45] was watching a video at some point where
[50:48] uh they were saying how Black Rock
[50:50] actually threatens companies to do
[50:52] certain things or they'll pull their
[50:54] investment or like ESG and Investing For
[50:57] example they tell them do this or we'll
[50:59] take our money out um you can't really
[51:02] do that with
[51:04] Bitcoin right because people aren't
[51:07] forced to invest they don't have to in
[51:09] they can literally take self- custody
[51:11] and they don't have to give it they
[51:12] don't have to give their Bitcoin to
[51:14] anyone if they die their Bitcoin goes
[51:16] with them if they don't share it with
[51:17] anybody right their Bitcoin goes with
[51:19] them so I think it's a little different
[51:21] there's also the the aspect of if you
[51:25] want to spend your Bitcoin you actually
[51:26] have to give away your
[51:27] Bitcoin on the theat currency system you
[51:30] can keep your assets forever you can
[51:32] like oh there was there was this uh
[51:34] there was this video that I saw where it
[51:38] was I think it was a host from Saturday
[51:40] Night Live from SNL he was saying how
[51:43] Elon Musk doesn't have to pay capital
[51:45] gains taxes on his Tesla shares but then
[51:49] he can use his Tesla shares as
[51:50] collateral to buy
[51:52] Twitter so they're not there when he has
[51:55] to pay capital gains tax but then
[51:57] they're there when you can use them as
[51:59] collateral so it's it's kind of a it's
[52:02] just a weird way to do things you can
[52:05] use this as collateral but you don't
[52:06] have to pay taxes on it so you don't
[52:07] have to contribute to
[52:09] society but you can use it to keep
[52:11] getting wealthier and wealthier and
[52:12] wealthier that again that's part of the
[52:13] the reason for the wealth Gap same thing
[52:15] with houses right um You can borrow
[52:17] against a house you don't have to pay
[52:19] taxes but
[52:22] then you you can you don't have to sell
[52:25] that house you have to pay tax taxes
[52:26] when you sell it so what people are
[52:28] doing is instead of having to pay those
[52:29] taxes they're just borrowing against
[52:31] their houses they're keeping this house
[52:33] forever because they know that housing
[52:36] is a basic human need and they'll be
[52:38] able to exploit someone to pay them rent
[52:42] forever right
[52:44] but that's I think that's one of the
[52:46] things the people at the bottom are only
[52:48] going to take it for so
[52:50] long eventually there will be so many
[52:53] people at the bottom that there will be
[52:54] better Solutions more Entre rurs I
[52:57] guarantee you somebody who's been
[52:59] renting for the last 30 years is going
[53:01] to find a way to build houses faster I
[53:05] had a conversation with someone who um
[53:08] he he wants to build modular homes he
[53:10] actually has a company um and the reason
[53:12] why he wants to do it is because housing
[53:14] is so expensive and his family was never
[53:17] able to own a home they were never never
[53:19] able to they always rented and because
[53:21] of this he wants to increase the supply
[53:22] of houses and he's working on it he's
[53:24] actually going to make it happen so I
[53:26] think he's he's also a bitcoiner which
[53:27] is really cool so I think eventually
[53:31] these people who are bitcoiners people
[53:33] who are seeing these problems they're
[53:35] going to change how the world Works
[53:37] they're going to change how real estate
[53:38] is used instead of using real estate as
[53:40] a savings tool as a bank account we're g
[53:42] to start using real estate for what it
[53:44] is a living
[53:46] space yeah I think every anyone that
[53:49] says a real estate is limited or like
[53:52] the supply of real estate is limited uh
[53:55] never went to the to some like Dubai for
[53:59] example there was no nothing and they
[54:02] just built a city where so many people
[54:04] are now living I just drive through
[54:06] Austria and there are like even such a
[54:09] small area there are places where
[54:11] there's like two houses and then there's
[54:13] like 10 minutes of Drive no no house and
[54:16] like there's so many expansion
[54:19] possibilities and then we have the
[54:22] possibilities of even going to another
[54:24] planets I mean this is far in the future
[54:26] but if like we have so much space on
[54:28] Earth so so much that we can build so
[54:31] many new things there then we can go
[54:34] above and a little bit be Beyond even
[54:36] there uh and then we can go even to
[54:39] other planets so like real estate is not
[54:43] scarce in in that sense it's it's it it
[54:46] feels logical because you you know the
[54:49] world and you're like oh it's a limited
[54:50] space and it's like oh I know there
[54:52] cannot be more I think the normal people
[54:55] can rap the head around that but it
[54:57] actually does not make sense really
[54:59] interesting
[55:01] yeah then um before we end we have a new
[55:06] end routine uh that I think last time
[55:09] with with you I did not had till now
[55:11] which is interesting maybe I had it I
[55:13] cannot actually remember but I will ask
[55:16] you anyways um we have a new Android
[55:19] team before the actual Andro te where I
[55:21] asked every guest on my podcast now what
[55:24] are you currently passionate about
[55:26] besides Bitcoin like what are you doing
[55:28] or learning uh or activity wise uh
[55:31] besides Bitcoin uh so this is a
[55:33] conversation that we were talking about
[55:35] this before something that I'm
[55:36] passionate about right now is creating
[55:38] content on uh on YouTube creating long-
[55:40] firm content I I was never able to do
[55:43] that before I feel like it's when you
[55:45] start doing it you realize how much time
[55:47] goes into it how much work goes into it
[55:48] to create something that people will
[55:50] actually watch it's proof of work right
[55:52] again that's that's exactly what it is
[55:54] but I'm very passionate about that and I
[55:55] watched your video on the camera setup
[55:59] found that very helpful that was that
[56:01] was an awesome video I I link it here if
[56:04] you can link it somewhere here if you
[56:05] can just so people can watch
[56:07] it I will definitely like uh it's um I
[56:11] don't know you know I think I said it
[56:13] new studio or something like that new
[56:16] studio on two or I don't know I think
[56:18] new studio or something was in a title
[56:20] if if people want to see it I will try
[56:22] to link it uh if I think about it when I
[56:24] edit but yeah it's
[56:26] I we talked about it before when I
[56:28] recorded but the amount of messages and
[56:31] DMs I got from that one video Even
[56:33] though I did not get a lot of fuse it
[56:34] got less fuse than usual um because I
[56:38] think people actually got something like
[56:40] they saw something behind the things and
[56:42] then you're like oh this this this video
[56:45] that you see there's actually a lot of
[56:46] work behind that and a lot of thoughts
[56:48] behind that how this this things look
[56:50] and and people that um also do content
[56:54] creating they they like it because they
[56:55] get value from to other people that
[56:57] don't do content they even also got
[56:59] value because they see a little bit
[57:00] behind the scenes what's going on so I
[57:02] like this kind of a style of a video and
[57:04] I'm I'm really glad that you also now in
[57:06] the YouTube and and video grading format
[57:08] I think it's the best best kind of a
[57:11] content and you have the best kind of a
[57:13] connection with people uh and I enjoy
[57:16] Twitter but it's a little short like
[57:19] it's it's just a lot of short things
[57:22] Instagram I never figured out I don't
[57:23] know how to how to do an Instagram I
[57:26] think I'm not I'm just not made for
[57:27] Instagram Twitter and YouTube I enjoy a
[57:29] lot and and the these days I really
[57:32] enjoy YouTube like it's a it's a great
[57:34] place H and yeah podcasting then in
[57:37] general you can also upload it there and
[57:39] stuff like that really cool um perfect
[57:42] then let's come to the end routine where
[57:44] the previous guest is asking a question
[57:45] for the next guest uh without knowing
[57:48] who the next guest actually is and your
[57:50] question from the previous guest is do
[57:52] you think that somewhere out there in
[57:54] the universe are aliens which are more
[57:57] intelligent than humans
[58:00] yeah if there's if there's an outer
[58:02] space then definitely uh there has to be
[58:06] right the US I mean not the US the the
[58:09] Earth can't be the only country that or
[58:11] sorry not the only country the only
[58:12] planet that can support life I'm sure
[58:14] there's uh another country another
[58:17] planet that can support life somewhere
[58:19] in the in the universe in the uh solar
[58:22] system whatever however far we go I'm
[58:25] sure there's at least one country I
[58:27] wouldn't I wouldn't be surprised if
[58:28] there's another copy of
[58:30] earth right just another another exact
[58:33] same thing as the Earth may be slightly
[58:35] slightly different but if there are
[58:37] aliens maybe they're able to survive
[58:40] with different resources right maybe
[58:42] they can use different resources from
[58:43] humans humans uh I think we have very
[58:47] specific needs we can't really survive
[58:49] on other planets but maybe the other
[58:51] maybe the other the other forms of life
[58:53] can survive without oxygen without water
[58:56] maybe they have their own way of
[58:58] survival right what are your thoughts on
[59:00] this I I that's actually a really good
[59:03] question though I never even thought of
[59:05] that um there's a lot of interesting uh
[59:08] thoughts in my head around the topic
[59:10] because first of all like I'm 100%
[59:13] certain that there is something out
[59:14] there I I I refuse to uh think that the
[59:19] human species is the most advanced
[59:21] species on on whatever we are like the
[59:24] solar system the planets and everything
[59:26] I think there's something more advanced
[59:27] out there probably I could be wrong of
[59:30] course um the scary thing is when does
[59:34] like we are exploring planets we are on
[59:37] the moon and stuff like that uh and
[59:40] hopefully we do in the next 50 years
[59:41] more of that but then when we look the
[59:44] other perspective if there's actually
[59:47] something more advanced than humans out
[59:49] there and they are the ones who are
[59:52] actually have great technology what if
[59:55] they are already seeing earth like they
[59:59] already like forms of that on Earth and
[60:01] and just before like before you really
[60:04] come to Planet maybe they just send like
[60:05] one rocket or like one few people or few
[60:09] whatever they they call them they it's
[60:12] like it it's not completely out of the
[60:14] realm that there are aliens already on
[60:16] Earth uh it's I I don't think it is but
[60:18] it's it's not out of the possibilities
[60:21] so it's it just explodes your mind when
[60:22] you think about it a lot uh and uh
[60:25] hopefully we get to the species before
[60:27] them because it means like whoever gets
[60:30] before to the other planet is probably
[60:31] more advanced than the other species
[60:34] yeah uh so so there are a lot of
[60:36] interesting thoughts I I have no clue
[60:39] about aliens I have no clue about other
[60:41] planets like I'm really bad educated on
[60:44] that stuff yeah I just refuse to thought
[60:47] that we are the only intelligent like
[60:50] when you even like when you see animals
[60:54] uh uh when you see them
[60:56] uh how how far they sometimes are close
[60:59] to to human beings uh and and I mean
[61:02] you're coming from them then you're like
[61:05] maybe there's something out there than
[61:07] that is way far superior than than
[61:10] humans because humans also have a lot of
[61:12] mistakes in in in them uh so maybe
[61:15] that's something really great out there
[61:17] and and we just don't know it yet like
[61:19] there's I love that kind of a talk and
[61:22] we're kind we're constantly discovering
[61:23] new things right we're constantly
[61:25] discovering things that we we never even
[61:26] thought of um like let's say uh when we
[61:30] discovered the Internet it's not like it
[61:32] didn't exist before that it existed we
[61:34] just didn't know it was there right
[61:37] there's going to be a point where even
[61:38] with electricity it existed we just
[61:41] didn't know it was there we didn't know
[61:42] how to use it fire we didn't know how to
[61:45] create it it existed it's not like it it
[61:47] didn't exist same thing with I same
[61:49] thing with Bitcoin right we it would
[61:50] have already it would have always
[61:51] existed I think what Satoshi Nakamoto
[61:54] did was he just put together certain
[61:56] inventions and he used those inventions
[61:58] to show us that it
[62:01] exists right not not now interesting
[62:04] question um do you think it's possible
[62:07] that satos Nakamoto is an
[62:10] alien see this is something that I've
[62:12] I've uh I've thought about I I don't
[62:16] know if it's I don't know if it's an
[62:17] alien maybe it's an AI right maybe it's
[62:21] uh general
[62:22] intelligence uh I think that's what it's
[62:24] called the is that what it's called um
[62:27] but basically where computers can think
[62:29] for themselves they can have emotions
[62:31] and all that stuff maybe it's maybe it's
[62:32] some kind of uh AI nobody has nobody
[62:36] knows what it
[62:37] is but then there could also be the fact
[62:39] that it's heal maybe it's heiny
[62:43] right yeah I mean it's it's it's way
[62:45] more likely that's halin or some some
[62:47] actual human it's way more likely it's
[62:50] fun though it's fun to think about these
[62:51] things it's it's really fun to to see
[62:53] where where where your mind could take
[62:55] you
[62:56] H definitely and uh I had an episode uh
[63:01] I don't you probably don't know him it's
[63:03] he's called
[63:04] rosi I I saw it Oh you saw the episode
[63:07] really cool and and he has this Vision
[63:11] that like rat like this is just sci-fi
[63:14] like fiction movie but he is also
[63:17] writing like actual what could happen
[63:19] and he has the the thing that Bitcoin
[63:21] mining will be 99% of all the energy use
[63:26] and he says that not because Bitcoin
[63:28] will eat up everything but we will be
[63:30] really good in abstracting solar energy
[63:33] when we have like solar panels on
[63:35] Mercury and basically um mining directly
[63:40] from the Sun uh and this will still be
[63:42] in a 10-minute vide I mean I'm really
[63:45] uneducated what the planet system and
[63:46] that is so like I'm always feeling
[63:48] unsecure when I'm insecure when I talk
[63:50] about that topic but it's really
[63:51] interesting what the EA like in this
[63:53] episode I feel like expanded my mind
[63:56] what's possible and he he said something
[63:58] like uh he can imagine because when we
[64:02] we talked about before the price
[64:04] predictions but what we don't like
[64:07] almost nobody factors in what if we find
[64:11] other planets and other planets also use
[64:14] Bitcoin and all of the sudden it's not 8
[64:17] billion people it's maybe 80 billion
[64:19] people or 200 billion people and we all
[64:23] kind of agree still the Bitcoin is the
[64:25] thing Bitcoin is the uh the currency of
[64:29] the small planetary system where like
[64:31] two three planets are there uh one zosi
[64:35] could be buying uh Like Houses uh but
[64:39] it's like really far off and he and he
[64:41] has this famous I think it was even in
[64:43] the title you will be able to buy with
[64:45] one Bitcoin b space station a solar
[64:49] system or yeah space station that's what
[64:50] it was but see there could also be okay
[64:53] let's look at this from a different
[64:54] perspective this can be fun um what if
[64:58] you know how we have
[64:59] shitcoins what if somebody came from
[65:02] another another planet and they have
[65:03] their own form of Bitcoin and they
[65:06] brought Bitcoin to this planet and it's
[65:09] just a copy of something that's already
[65:10] existing
[65:12] and they're getting us to I mean again
[65:16] this this it's so fun to think about
[65:18] these it's so abstract it's so
[65:20] interesting because I don't know if it's
[65:22] even possible but maybe there's
[65:25] something here we don't know maybe this
[65:27] is a bad note to end on but maybe
[65:29] Bitcoin will fail because of that
[65:32] right in this is this is the the thing
[65:36] like there's always a black one event
[65:39] but you should not just because of the
[65:41] Black Swan event then uh uh diversify in
[65:46] shitcoins and diversify in in in in DP
[65:50] assets that will not hold anything
[65:52] because guess what if a Black Swan comes
[65:54] and alien comes and they have the better
[65:55] money and then we have to uh dump
[65:59] Bitcoin because now Bitcoin is a
[66:00] shitcoin and we have to adopt their coin
[66:03] that did not exist on Earth because it
[66:05] was not on Earth before your house and
[66:07] your stocks are also going to zero it's
[66:09] all worth anyways yeah so so you always
[66:12] have to find the best money and if
[66:14] there's a better species coming and and
[66:16] and bringing in like an even better form
[66:19] of money however like this this looks
[66:21] like yeah then then we just late and and
[66:24] we we up but
[66:26] exactly right but at least we that's the
[66:29] thing at least we took the chance right
[66:32] very the chances of that happening are
[66:33] what
[66:35] 0.00001% maybe even less
[66:39] 0.00001%
[66:41] but I think I'm okay with that
[66:44] risk so you're okay if if aliens come
[66:48] and and forces us in a new monetary
[66:50] system I mean if we have to do it we
[66:52] have to do it right I'd rather not go to
[66:55] space prison right I think it's a it's
[66:58] it's a fun and and good note to end on
[67:00] our podcast uh it's it's been a pleasure
[67:03] we come from uh what how many people
[67:06] will be in Bitcoin when we reach 1
[67:08] million to what happens if another
[67:11] alation forces us a new monetary system
[67:13] on uh it's been a fun conversation uh
[67:16] thank you rard for for being on when
