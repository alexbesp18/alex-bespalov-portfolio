[00:00] I'm a huge proponent of circular
[00:01] economies because that's how Bitcoin
[00:03] spreads you can't sustain a functioning
[00:06] civilization without something that
[00:08] allows you to transport that value over
[00:11] great distances almost instantly that is
[00:13] the beauty of Bitcoin you control the
[00:15] money you control Society we advocate
[00:17] for just making up your own mind using
[00:19] your own proof of work validate
[00:21] everything that you come across if
[00:22] you're going to decentralize your money
[00:24] if you want to be a sovereign individual
[00:25] you have to get your kids out of school
[00:27] when you have a monetary system that is
[00:30] sound and hard and true and and has
[00:33] integrity and requires proof of work and
[00:35] it requires those values from its users
[00:38] what kind of culture could that
[00:41] [Music]
[00:43] bring I understand Tiana that you have
[00:47] written more books before that book
[00:49] already actually this is my first book
[00:52] although I do a lot of writing I've um
[00:54] written a dissertation I'm going to be
[00:57] turning the book that we just wrote sh
[01:00] Toshi the story of money and the rise of
[01:02] Bitcoin uh Joel is a co-author on that
[01:05] and I'm going to be taking that material
[01:07] and turning it into children's books to
[01:09] teach them about the story of money and
[01:12] Bitcoin but on a level that they can
[01:14] understand I will eventually have a lot
[01:16] of books and I have about six other
[01:17] titles on the story of series that I
[01:19] want to write education being the next
[01:21] one but this is my first full length
[01:24] book that I've published oh really cool
[01:27] perfect really cool uh and Trel you it's
[01:29] also your first book like that a
[01:31] co-author uh as a co-author yes but um I
[01:34] also uh have Ambitions to write other
[01:37] things though I'm my background is in um
[01:41] entertainment and film uh so my um my
[01:46] goals are to be more in the fictional
[01:48] realm so um so I'm just helping out with
[01:52] Deanna and helping her tell her story so
[01:55] while we both have writing Ambitions we
[01:58] we're not writing exactly the same thing
[02:00] that we do share a common love for
[02:03] Bitcoin really really cool Dan what what
[02:06] what do you think is is like what's the
[02:08] main goal of of that book like what what
[02:10] do you want to accomplish with it so my
[02:13] um I was a professor for a long time a
[02:16] professor of humanities history and
[02:18] anthropology so I took that approach to
[02:21] the book um telling the stories that
[02:23] I've been sharing with students for
[02:24] years about um history and specifically
[02:29] about econom IC history and how we go
[02:32] from Barter systems and even as you know
[02:35] recent as the 1950s there were still
[02:38] cultures on the planet that were using
[02:40] solely a barter system so not everybody
[02:42] had adopted money and so and there are
[02:45] still some really um kind of um off the
[02:49] beaten path of remote indigenous
[02:51] cultures that still use a lot of barter
[02:53] today and so I wanted to tell the story
[02:55] of how humans have invented and then
[02:59] broken and then reinvented money and
[03:01] even banking over time through history
[03:04] and these anthropological examples so
[03:07] it's really mostly a history slash uh
[03:11] telling book telling the stories of
[03:13] different groups of humans and their
[03:15] relationship with money and what how
[03:17] they've dealt with it and what they've
[03:19] done oh really um and it I think the
[03:24] goal like the purpose of my writing was
[03:26] to explain why we need Bitcoin um as
[03:29] someone who teaches and who um I teach
[03:32] reading and writing but I also teach
[03:34] history and literature and if you don't
[03:36] explain the why we need something then
[03:38] it's just some new fad shiny new object
[03:41] toy you know something that you kids ask
[03:44] for Christmas and then they're going to
[03:45] you know re forget about it a month
[03:47] later type of thing and if you don't
[03:49] understand that why and you hit people's
[03:51] pain points then it's not going to catch
[03:54] on and this is like my mission is to
[03:57] orange pill the world the best I can and
[04:00] particularly as a teacher I want to help
[04:04] orange pill younger like the next
[04:05] generation of bitcoiners but you have to
[04:08] have that why because if they can't
[04:09] relate to it in their own lives then
[04:11] it's not going to be um they're not
[04:13] going to integrate it the way that it
[04:15] should be integrated interesting and and
[04:17] for those who I feel like in the in the
[04:19] Bitcoin Community the history of money
[04:21] is way more understood than in any other
[04:24] usually audience that that you usually
[04:27] speak um but for those who didn't didn't
[04:30] uh fully uh understand what the history
[04:33] of money is maybe as a beginning
[04:36] question what is the history of of of
[04:38] money and why does the history of money
[04:41] make Bitcoin so clear as a solution
[04:43] going forward it's it's actually quite
[04:47] complex um and so you go from Barter
[04:50] where you just have this you know Mutual
[04:52] needs um and once you realize that I'm a
[04:57] farmer and I am growing you know maze if
[05:01] you're in the new world or corn or grain
[05:03] or Elmer or um incor wheat if you're in
[05:07] Mesopotamia and that's all you're
[05:09] growing and as civilizations get more
[05:11] complex the need for some sort of um
[05:15] intermediary to exchange something that
[05:18] shows some sort of value that becomes
[05:20] more and more necessary because when
[05:23] you're doing barter system you can keep
[05:25] mental ledgers and those work for really
[05:27] simple and small societies where
[05:29] everybody knows everybody there's
[05:31] typically some sort of familial
[05:34] relationship and they you don't have
[05:36] that complexity but once you start
[05:38] interacting or trying to exchange with
[05:40] strangers you don't have that trust and
[05:43] things get more complex and so the
[05:46] Mesopotamians they didn't have coinage
[05:49] but they would like take little bits of
[05:51] metal called shekels they would melt
[05:53] these down and they had a certain value
[05:56] that was um measured with grain a bushel
[05:58] of grain once you get that then you're
[06:01] going to start having Banks because
[06:02] you're going to have to have someone
[06:03] who's going to distribute that metal
[06:05] there's going to have to be known
[06:06] weights so they have these weight Stones
[06:08] so they can measure the metal and it
[06:10] gets that alone gets very complicated so
[06:13] when you start having people live in
[06:16] sedentary societies there becomes a more
[06:20] complex need for exchange and really
[06:23] money is just a you know it's a medium
[06:25] of exchange right so um that's that's
[06:29] the what where it starts and then as
[06:31] banking gets more complex and then the
[06:35] you know the sort of Rise of some sort
[06:37] of centralized Authority overseeing
[06:40] banking or money whether it's individual
[06:43] Bankers or if it is um you know the
[06:48] state or the government that is in
[06:50] charge of it if um in Mesopotamia the
[06:53] banks were in the temple so that was
[06:55] very much tied to the religion and so
[06:57] once you have that centralization then
[06:59] you get into power and control you
[07:01] control the money you control Society we
[07:04] know that right especially in the Fiat
[07:06] world that we're living in now um so I
[07:08] think it's a really interesting story
[07:10] and by spending time I mean the book is
[07:13] um 16 chapters with an epilogue and
[07:16] there's only two chapters on bitcoin but
[07:18] by spending time and really focusing in
[07:20] on what Rome what was going on in Rome
[07:23] in the banking system and what these
[07:25] Emperors were doing and how these law
[07:27] codes evolved over time I I'm a
[07:29] historian so there's a lot of links or a
[07:33] lot of mentions of primary sources on
[07:35] our web page um Shela Satoshi decom I
[07:38] have a whole thing about primary sources
[07:40] relating to money going all the way back
[07:42] to the first lock codes and I'm always
[07:44] adding more and more sources to that
[07:47] repository so people if they want to see
[07:49] what actually was written what is in the
[07:51] history not interpreted by somebody else
[07:53] they can go there and those are the
[07:55] documents that we use to write this the
[07:58] book to tell that story
[08:00] H it's really interesting if I could
[08:02] just add to that in helping shape the
[08:05] book and and reviewing it um as TI was
[08:08] working on it uh it struck me how often
[08:11] the same story played out over and over
[08:13] again um the society that used the
[08:17] monetary medium would um run into some
[08:21] kind of Roadblock that was limited by
[08:23] the nature of the medium and have to
[08:27] reinvent it in order to get pass that so
[08:30] that Society could continue evolving and
[08:34] um and we would see that um as uh you
[08:37] know Indiana's example of the um bits of
[08:41] metal that the early civilizations like
[08:44] the Mesopotamians Mesopotamians used for
[08:49] um for um a an intermediary of
[08:53] exchange had to evolve into standardized
[08:57] weights so that the money money could be
[09:00] used um at greater distances with
[09:03] greater population and greater societal
[09:06] complexity and it happened over and over
[09:09] again and uh it's and when you see it
[09:13] happen over and over again you realize
[09:14] that there's some basic um uh and and
[09:18] fundamental ways that human beings
[09:19] relate to each other that are Timeless
[09:21] and so the lessons that we can draw from
[09:24] Mesopotamia Rome and uh even China and
[09:29] further as human societies evolved we
[09:32] see the same um the same Dynamics at
[09:35] play today and that's what leads to
[09:38] bitcoin do you think Joel that uh all
[09:42] that what de said but also you said and
[09:46] history of money that we kind of melt
[09:48] all those different fear currencies all
[09:50] those uh different sorts of monies that
[09:53] we have melting in Bitcoin as a
[09:56] singularity of of of money at some point
[09:59] I I love the word Singularity because it
[10:02] it does um imply a certain kind of
[10:06] Apex uh to the evolution of money we we
[10:10] touched on andiana specifically touched
[10:13] on um the the need for an intermediary
[10:18] that facilitates trade transactions and
[10:22] relationships between human beings right
[10:24] so that was the initial use case of
[10:27] money but then as Society evolved and
[10:30] became more complex the trade
[10:33] relationships not only grew more complex
[10:36] in the kind of Trades that were made you
[10:39] know like um uh if you if you're a
[10:42] farmer and you're not just going to take
[10:44] your your Harvest and sell it at the
[10:48] moment you harvest it you're going to
[10:50] need to plan for the future so you're
[10:52] going to have to invent some ways to get
[10:54] paid so that you can put your um uh you
[10:58] know invest in farm so you have to
[11:00] develop some kind of a like even a
[11:02] Futures market so you could defer um the
[11:07] the initial investment at the time of
[11:09] till the time of your Harvest so it gets
[11:11] really complicated and that's where more
[11:14] complex money comes in but the the the
[11:18] other story that keeps coming in is that
[11:23] um throughout human history in order to
[11:26] have the money be accepted by um
[11:31] audiences that are far off and complex
[11:35] they had to imbue the money with some
[11:37] kind of trust they had to trust that the
[11:41] money was good and initially with
[11:44] something like gold um some kind of
[11:47] precious metal we it could be trusted
[11:49] because it was rare it was hard to dig
[11:51] out of the ground but um but over time
[11:56] that kind of money uh showed its
[11:59] limitations and then um money had to
[12:02] evolve so it could be um used and and
[12:07] validated by authority figures and and
[12:10] people who could legitimately apply
[12:13] trust to the money and people had to
[12:16] believe that which also leads the uh it
[12:19] opens the door to corruption and that's
[12:21] the new Dynamic that plays as the trust
[12:24] level increases the opportunity for
[12:27] corruption also increases
[12:30] and this this played out in increasing
[12:33] complexity which is a story that we tell
[12:36] throughout the last thousand years from
[12:39] the emergence of paper money in China
[12:41] all the way to central banks and uh and
[12:44] that's where Bitcoin comes in because
[12:46] it's the first non-material instantly
[12:49] transportable money that can deal with
[12:52] all kinds of complex economic
[12:54] relationships but doesn't need to be
[12:56] trusted doesn't have an opportunity for
[13:00] it to be
[13:01] corrupted so that was kind of a Scenic
[13:03] root approach to answering your question
[13:06] um and I I hope that helped a little
[13:08] yeah definitely it it it I think when we
[13:12] when we talk about money and you touch
[13:14] on it with with trust a little bit uh
[13:16] trust is involved the money so deeply um
[13:21] and maybe to Diana like what makes uh
[13:25] trusting in money good like why are
[13:28] people Trust in one sort of money and
[13:31] not in other forms money and why will
[13:33] will they then choose just Bitcoin I I
[13:36] get that all a lot from from especially
[13:38] people that are kind of thinking about
[13:41] Bitcoin in a good way they want to get
[13:43] Bitcoin in their heads and they're like
[13:45] oh I I get that Bitcoin is a new form of
[13:47] money they don't only see it as an
[13:49] investment as a gambling thing uh and
[13:51] they're like but but people still have
[13:53] to trust things uh why should I trust
[13:56] Bitcoin and I'm like yeah you can verify
[13:57] it and then they're like ah but not a
[13:59] coda I cannot verify
[14:02] Bitcoin yeah so um the trust issue is
[14:05] really interesting and even to look at
[14:07] that factor across um the spectrum of
[14:10] what we talk about in the book from
[14:12] Mesopotamia we talk about the lydians
[14:14] and the Greeks and the Romans the
[14:15] Chinese the mediche in Italy central
[14:18] banks that start um you know in Sweden
[14:21] we talk about you know a lot of
[14:24] different cultures and the the trust
[14:27] varies depending on the time period um
[14:30] who is in you know the sort of the
[14:32] ruling class if there is trust if there
[14:34] isn't trust and I think um in the modern
[14:38] world what we're seeing with Fiat is
[14:41] that because I'm an educator this is
[14:43] something that I spend a lot of time
[14:44] thinking about I think there's a
[14:45] breakdown in education to where students
[14:49] are really and this is particularly in
[14:51] the west um I'm American and so that's
[14:54] what I'm you know can really speak to
[14:55] but also in places in Europe but I I've
[14:59] you know I'm I've taught kids um that
[15:02] are even like their parents are from
[15:04] China or they're living in Taiwan so I
[15:07] have you know kind of across um a
[15:10] spectrum of you know it's all anecdotal
[15:13] from my own experience but I've also
[15:14] done research that the education there's
[15:17] a breakdown and so students are told
[15:20] what to think not how to think and
[15:23] there's a a sort of a dumbing Down of
[15:25] the curriculum globally that we're
[15:28] seeing if you look at a textbook from
[15:31] 1850 or even 19 you know 20 versus what
[15:35] we see today what they were doing in
[15:37] fourth grade then is almost High School
[15:39] level now and so there's this sort of
[15:42] dummying down of the world there's this
[15:46] lack of interest in
[15:48] curiosity and when curiosity is
[15:51] extinguished then you just kind of live
[15:53] blindly I mean there's a whole category
[15:55] of literature dystopian literature and
[15:58] where people just kind of like in 1984
[16:00] for example by George Orwell they just
[16:02] blindly follow the state and of course
[16:04] you have a few of the heroes that are
[16:06] going to you know kind of push against
[16:08] that and I think in the modern world
[16:09] it's the bitcoiners that are the heroes
[16:12] um but if you kind of get people
[16:16] complacent where they don't have to
[16:17] think about certain things and they
[16:19] don't have the Curiosity or even the
[16:22] will or the drive because it's all been
[16:24] kind of just pushed out of them their
[16:26] whole life then that's that's where
[16:29] we're at with the culture and um you can
[16:32] you know I can pinpoint different part
[16:36] you know things that have happened in
[16:38] the history of education of what how we
[16:40] get here however um we're here so what
[16:44] do we do well that's one reason I'm a
[16:46] homeschool advocate so I think that's
[16:48] where the trust issue comes in is that
[16:50] people have just learned to trust they
[16:53] trust the schools to teach their kids
[16:55] for six to eight hours a day and they
[16:57] don't even have to think about them in
[16:59] America in some um cities they don't
[17:01] even have to feed them breakfast or
[17:03] lunch and sometimes a a snack after
[17:06] school so there's two to three meals
[17:09] that the families don't even have to
[17:10] think about anymore because it's being
[17:12] taken care of so they don't have to
[17:14] worry about nutrition they don't have to
[17:15] worry about education they leave the
[17:18] moral education or morality up to other
[17:21] people so basically you are completely
[17:25] trusting of the system and that's been
[17:27] ingrained in the culture
[17:29] and how they do that is by controlling
[17:31] the money inflation reducing the value
[17:34] of money over time and then you have to
[17:35] have two parents working outside of the
[17:37] home and it's just it seems very you
[17:40] know this kind of sinister there's some
[17:42] Dr Evil in the background and I don't
[17:44] know if it was always that intentional I
[17:47] think there have been nefarious players
[17:48] over time but this is the state of the
[17:50] reality so people have to trust because
[17:53] they have to just figure out how to work
[17:54] to pay their bills everybody's just
[17:56] hustling to make a living for the most
[17:58] part
[17:59] and that you just don't have the brain
[18:02] space or the time or the energy or even
[18:05] the mental wherewithal of how to do
[18:07] things on your own do you see the the
[18:10] education system in a in a sense also
[18:12] decentralizing with with homeschooling I
[18:14] also see a lot of Bitcoin as our
[18:16] homeschoolers like as a big Community
[18:18] around that absolutely and that's my
[18:21] that's really my um crusade in this
[18:24] lifetime is bitcoiners if you're going
[18:28] to decentral ize your money if you want
[18:29] to be a sovereign individual you have to
[18:31] get your kids out of schools I
[18:33] understand like in Germany for example
[18:35] it is illegal to homeschool however I
[18:37] argue you can deprogram and you can
[18:40] still educate your children you can take
[18:41] their brains back and I try to help as
[18:45] many people um with that I always tell
[18:48] on Twitter contact me I can help you
[18:51] with curriculum I you know where to find
[18:53] even free
[18:54] resources the legalities what you can do
[18:57] to take back your child's Minds because
[19:01] that's really the future right this is
[19:02] the next generation and it's not even
[19:04] just about learning Bitcoin it's about
[19:07] saving the minds of the Next Generation
[19:10] we do have uh an entire chapter actually
[19:12] devoted to the issue of centralization
[19:15] versus decentralization and we provide
[19:18] many examples of of this conflict that
[19:22] happened over time in history and one of
[19:24] the uh examples that we used was in fact
[19:27] education and how in the early part of
[19:30] the um American
[19:32] history um education was much more
[19:36] decentralized which is to say that it
[19:38] did not have a governing Authority that
[19:41] imposed a a uh a particular um method
[19:47] and um and system upon the populace but
[19:50] was rather um more uh uh it it rather
[19:55] left decisions about education to
[19:57] individuals and that's the heart of what
[20:00] um centralization versus
[20:01] decentralization means it's actually the
[20:04] topic of the next book in this series
[20:06] that I'm writing is education so I'm
[20:08] going to tell the story of Education
[20:09] going all the way back to ancient Greece
[20:12] to the modern world and kind of How It's
[20:14] evolved and what's changed and how
[20:17] things have gotten where they are I want
[20:19] to tell that story because it's
[20:20] something I've researched and it's been
[20:21] really close to me for a long time I
[20:24] think that could be a really good book
[20:26] for the Bitcoin community
[20:28] I I feel like uh Bitcoin Community is
[20:31] striving for um kind of Bitcoin related
[20:35] content that is not really Bitcoin
[20:37] content uh and I think decentralizing
[20:40] education the history of education what
[20:42] has been wrong with education uh that
[20:44] could be a hit I told you I'm hoping I'm
[20:49] really interested in it and um I got my
[20:52] Doctorate in Education in uh
[20:55] 2016 um I went back to get that because
[20:58] I thought I could fight the corrupt
[20:59] system of colleges and Academia in the
[21:02] States from the inside realized that it
[21:05] wasn't possible and six months later I
[21:06] walked away to become a homeschool
[21:08] Advocate and curriculum um builder for
[21:11] hom school and then a private teacher so
[21:14] um I researched it a lot while getting
[21:16] my doctorate and unpacking it and I
[21:18] continue to do it um and it's just it's
[21:22] like you know watching a train wreck you
[21:26] can't like take your eyes away not that
[21:27] anybody would want to watch a train
[21:29] wreck but you just can't peel your eyes
[21:30] aways it's really scarily and
[21:34] horrifically fascinating so I can't wait
[21:37] to tell that story be interesting so you
[21:40] are correct in oh I'm sorry uh I was
[21:42] just going to add that you you are
[21:44] absolutely correct in saying that
[21:45] bitcoiners are looking for non-bitcoin
[21:48] specific material that still aligns with
[21:50] your values and we all live under this
[21:52] umbrella of values that attracted us to
[21:55] Bitcoin in the first place namely uh
[21:57] independent
[21:59] um all these virtues that used to be Tim
[22:02] honored civilizational values like
[22:04] honesty and integrity but also proof of
[22:07] work doing your own work to validate
[22:11] information uh these are all values that
[22:13] we live by or um or contemplate as
[22:17] bitcoiners that attract us to each other
[22:19] now it would be great if there was um
[22:21] information that spoke to that and uh
[22:24] not just information but cultural
[22:25] artifacts like art and um uh and film
[22:29] and uh you know all these other things
[22:31] that make up a culture but that's what
[22:33] we're striving to do I guess and uh our
[22:35] book is just uh one way to add to that
[22:39] pile um but I would actually like to um
[22:42] emphasize the the point about trust from
[22:45] earlier that um the trust is uh in the
[22:50] context that we speak about it is an
[22:52] economic um
[22:54] Concept in which people t uh they def
[22:58] the validation of the money that they're
[23:00] using to some other entity um it could
[23:04] be another person it could be uh a
[23:06] centralized Authority it could be a bank
[23:09] um it could even be someone you take out
[23:11] a loan from but what you're saying when
[23:13] you give your trust to a monetary system
[23:16] or a piece of money is that this
[23:18] represents value that someone else
[23:20] vouches for and so I don't necessarily
[23:23] need to validate or vouch for it myself
[23:26] I just accept that someone is doing it
[23:29] for me and that um that issue that that
[23:33] those choices that people have made for
[23:36] now going on
[23:38] Millennia uh was uh an it's it's an
[23:42] absolutely crucial component of the
[23:44] story that we're trying to tell because
[23:47] by deferring your your own personal
[23:50] responsibility to validate um the money
[23:53] that you use it leads to other entities
[23:57] taking advantage of that and getting and
[24:00] and corrupting the system and then the
[24:02] value that you place in that money is no
[24:04] longer valuable it's it's um it's
[24:07] something that is now out of your
[24:09] control but it it's important to realize
[24:12] that it had to be that way in order to
[24:17] have complex societies where you have
[24:19] trade that takes place across oceans you
[24:22] have to be able to trust the money that
[24:24] you use or else you're not going to be
[24:26] able to make the transaction you can't
[24:28] take a ship full of gold and over to the
[24:32] new world and with all the risk that
[24:34] that involves like shipwrecks or just
[24:37] not or the time involved in transporting
[24:40] that that
[24:41] value uh you can't uh sustain a a
[24:46] functioning civilization without
[24:48] something that allows you to transport
[24:51] that value over great distances almost
[24:54] instantly but that's that is the beauty
[24:56] of Bitcoin we've come to the a point now
[24:59] where we can have those transactions and
[25:02] um and have it be trustless because now
[25:05] we have a way to validate it like we
[25:06] couldn't do before with um with money
[25:10] that had the value of portability but um
[25:13] but could easily be corrupted if you
[25:15] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[25:17] regular basis I guess you already bought
[25:20] some Bitcoin and now the most important
[25:22] step is to keep the Bitcoin keep them
[25:26] secure in a hardware wallet my personal
[25:28] recommendation for harder wallet is the
[25:30] bit box it's super secure it's simple to
[25:33] set up it's also perfect gift for a
[25:35] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[25:38] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[25:41] with the code Robin at the checkout
[25:43] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[25:47] your bitbox and if you really want to
[25:50] bulletproof your self custody setup your
[25:52] security setup and maybe even your
[25:55] citizenship setup you have to talk to
[25:58] the Bitcoin way if you go to the Bitcoin
[26:00] way.com
[26:02] Partners robobin you get a 30 minute
[26:06] free call where you can dive deep with
[26:09] them if your self- custody setup is
[26:12] secure if your citizenship is secure or
[26:15] maybe might be improvable or your
[26:17] digital footprint in general is secure
[26:21] they are the experts in cyber security
[26:23] in Bitcoin self custody and how to be a
[26:27] secure sovereign individual in general I
[26:30] love that a lot and and maybe also to
[26:32] the to the point before on what you just
[26:35] said with with uh centralization and
[26:38] decentralization plus that what you just
[26:40] said is is there any Alo with educating
[26:44] a little bit is there any realm where
[26:46] like centralization makes sense is is
[26:49] there like uh particular things where
[26:51] you like centralization actually does
[26:54] make sense and do you also touch on that
[26:56] in in the book um yes yes we do uh I
[26:58] know de wants to jump in on that right
[27:00] okay all right so um yeah we we actually
[27:03] do talk about some of the values of of
[27:06] centralization um because and we do have
[27:09] a couple examples in the book um where
[27:13] it it can make sense ultimately um we we
[27:18] come down on the side of
[27:19] decentralization because and but not in
[27:22] every single circumstances um one thing
[27:26] that centralization can do is provide
[27:28] standards that um that are imposed by
[27:32] one entity and it could be a government
[27:35] it could be a um a company for example
[27:38] um it sets the ball rolling so that we
[27:41] can then exist in that ecosystem but
[27:43] then we still have to make up our own
[27:45] minds and say okay that's those are
[27:47] valuable standards so we will continue
[27:49] to play by those rules um so the initial
[27:53] centralized entity started it but from
[27:58] our perspective as individuals we'll
[28:00] still need to validate it on our own to
[28:03] say that it is good but if we don't do
[28:06] that that's where it gets easily
[28:08] corrupted because now we're
[28:10] delegating our own independent Minds in
[28:13] judging those uh those systems that were
[28:17] um uh conferred to us and um and now
[28:22] that can be taken advantage of by
[28:24] nefarious actors so um so I I think
[28:29] ultimately I think we advocate for just
[28:32] making up your own mind using your own
[28:34] proof of work validate everything that
[28:36] you come across but understand that it's
[28:39] um something sometimes it's not easy to
[28:43] do or get the ball rolling
[28:45] with it's interesting yeah one thing if
[28:48] that's okay Robin what I want to say
[28:49] about centralization also is context we
[28:52] think of centralization like the United
[28:54] States government the massive massive
[28:56] entity but centralization go even down
[28:58] on the family level right so maybe you
[29:00] have a family or a family with an
[29:03] extended family and maybe it is the
[29:05] patriarch who is the centralized figure
[29:08] in the family or maybe the matriarch the
[29:10] mother and she keeps the household
[29:11] running and there's a division of labor
[29:13] so you can look at it sort of this macro
[29:17] these huge entities that want to control
[29:20] but all of us in some way or another
[29:23] have some centralization in their life
[29:25] even the most sovereign individual if
[29:27] you look at it is there's one person
[29:30] making decisions for others right and so
[29:32] that's kind of the idea it's just on how
[29:36] you want to do that and what you're okay
[29:39] and that again that goes back to that
[29:40] trust thing right you would trust your
[29:42] family well hopefully you would trust
[29:44] your family with those sort of that
[29:46] level of centralization and that you
[29:48] know potra Familia is a thing that goes
[29:51] back to the Roman Empire or the Roman
[29:53] even Republic this idea that the father
[29:55] is the head of the household and that
[29:58] that the emperor would become Head of
[30:00] the State and it would mirror that role
[30:02] and that's how you get kind of past this
[30:05] idea that we will never have another
[30:07] king in Rome is that the emperor is p
[30:10] ptra Familia um to the entire Empire and
[30:14] so you can kind of think of
[30:15] centralization in a lot of different
[30:17] ways and it doesn't always have to be
[30:19] these huge corporations or massive NOS
[30:23] or state governments you can have it and
[30:26] it can be okay so there's um I think a
[30:29] lot of it is mindset and just really
[30:31] being present and making
[30:34] those rational decisions in your own
[30:37] life what works and what doesn't work
[30:39] and then being able to say I was wrong I
[30:41] messed up that's okay I've learned
[30:43] something and as long as you're learning
[30:45] something then you move forward and you
[30:47] find another way it's it's an
[30:49] interesting concept this idea of
[30:51] centralization and decentralization one
[30:54] interesting point that I I think I wrote
[30:57] it uh like last week or week before that
[31:00] where it was about how many people work
[31:03] in companies and how many people are
[31:05] Freelancers and how many people are on
[31:07] their own and stuff like that and it was
[31:09] I think about I think it was a US study
[31:12] uh where 35% around that number are
[31:16] currently Freelancers or have an one
[31:19] person company or something like that uh
[31:21] and the starus show like in the next
[31:23] like few years uh this will rapidly grow
[31:26] and I also see it already now in my
[31:28] friend Circle uh more and more people
[31:31] actually uh just work for like one two
[31:34] companies or three companies uh they can
[31:36] set their own schedule it's more um uh
[31:40] it's more based on an actual work and
[31:43] less on oh you spend time in work uh
[31:46] also a concept that we have in in school
[31:48] a lot like oh you sit in school to sit
[31:50] in the school and not to learn something
[31:52] um but but do do you also see that the
[31:55] decentralization of of the workplace and
[31:57] this also related to to the money and
[31:59] all the things that we already spoke
[32:01] about definitely I mean I'm Joel and I
[32:03] are both living it I used to work in a
[32:05] centralized system in a public college
[32:07] system in California and I don't work
[32:10] that I left and then we had a company we
[32:13] had a small family company of um
[32:14] creating homeschool curriculum based on
[32:17] the great books and um then we shut that
[32:22] down because we moved um to Florida
[32:24] during covid and then we've moved to El
[32:27] Salvador since year ago from Florida and
[32:30] so um I have been pretty much a gig
[32:32] worker in education I work as a
[32:35] consultant uh for a Writing Center in
[32:38] the United States I have my own tutoring
[32:41] that I do um I you know I'm writing my
[32:43] Bitcoin books I'm you know I'm working
[32:46] with Bitcoin Beach on an education
[32:48] project right now you know this idea of
[32:49] gig worker and it's really there's the
[32:52] stress of you know trying to figure out
[32:54] how you're going to pay your bills
[32:55] because you don't have that check but
[32:57] it's it's it's also very empowering
[32:59] being able
[33:01] to follow what you want to do and being
[33:04] able to shift on a dime in case that
[33:07] that vision changes which I have had
[33:09] happen since I left Academia in 2017
[33:13] I've shifted several times on what I
[33:15] thought I wanted to do when I grow up S
[33:17] to speak so I think it it allows for a
[33:20] lot more flexibility which I think
[33:22] allows for a lot more individual
[33:25] happiness well I think it's also
[33:28] important to know that um the Fiat
[33:30] system has so many incentives in place
[33:33] that not only make it easier for you to
[33:36] get sucked into uh the standard
[33:40] employment situation uh where you clock
[33:43] in and clock out but it also sets up
[33:45] barriers to people who want to escape
[33:47] the system and uh you know there's
[33:51] there's all kinds of incentives against
[33:54] going to um your building your own
[33:56] business for example
[33:58] having to uh spend so much time energy
[34:02] money and resources on on Regulatory and
[34:07] um and other um uh other requirements of
[34:13] law like providing health care for your
[34:16] employees um these are all things that
[34:19] make it so incredibly different uh
[34:22] difficult to be independent but that is
[34:24] a function of the incentives that are
[34:26] put into place by by high temper High
[34:29] Time preference system um and that the
[34:33] the Fiat uh system imposes so it's it's
[34:37] unfortunate and harder but uh but the
[34:42] reward is your own sovereignty so it's
[34:45] so such an interesting topic for me uh
[34:47] the decentralization and also with
[34:49] Workforce and and with money um there's
[34:52] one uh topic that that I had in my mind
[34:55] because someone brought it up in a
[34:57] podcast I don't remember his name
[34:59] unfortunately a few podcasts ago we
[35:01] talked about that I'm not sure which one
[35:03] it was um where he talked about Bitcoin
[35:08] will be the final uh development of
[35:11] money till we might end up in an energy
[35:14] abundant uh system where we just have so
[35:18] much AI robotics energy it's everything
[35:22] in an abundant flow that we don't really
[35:24] need the concept of money anymore is
[35:26] that something that that is is even
[35:29] possible to think about that we we live
[35:31] in a system where where money uh is not
[35:34] an not not even there because the
[35:37] everything is in in in overflow there
[35:40] anyways okay so I want to preface this
[35:43] because I'm ready to pounce on this
[35:44] because that I'm I'm just going to
[35:45] preface this by saying that that is um
[35:48] communist wish wish fulfillment um but
[35:53] to be
[35:54] specific um the nature of human beings
[35:58] is uh basically an alternative between
[36:01] life and death a choice that human
[36:04] beings have to make between life and
[36:06] death and because human beings have a
[36:08] choice about this and they have a
[36:11] conceptual ability the ability to think
[36:13] in in conceptual
[36:15] terms the manner in which we pursue
[36:18] values that uphold our life um can be
[36:22] practically infinite because of the who
[36:25] we are as distinct individuals so that
[36:28] means that there's a as human beings we
[36:31] will still want for things regardless of
[36:36] abundance and if that is the case and we
[36:39] still produce values we are still able
[36:41] to produce values that we can trade if
[36:44] we produce values in a surplus that
[36:46] allow us to trade between human beings
[36:48] we will still need a um an intermediary
[36:53] that allows us to create effective and
[36:55] efficient trade and so so that money um
[36:59] that whatever that money is has to at
[37:03] its root be it has to serve the
[37:05] functions of money and those functions
[37:08] as we all know are a medium of exchange
[37:11] and a store of value as well as a unit
[37:14] of account the ability to to to use that
[37:18] monetary element to be the thing that we
[37:21] use to count value with so that means
[37:24] that uh if if that is uh if we still
[37:28] have to have that it still needs to be
[37:31] valuable to be used as money and that
[37:34] means it has to be hard to produce it
[37:36] has to be scarce it has to have all
[37:39] these these qualities of money which we
[37:41] talk about in our book by the way uh and
[37:44] we have it so if we as human beings will
[37:48] still want for things because of the
[37:50] basic alternative we have between life
[37:52] and death and we're still conceptual
[37:54] human beings we are still going to need
[37:56] money because our want for things is
[37:59] going to be infinite I think this topic
[38:01] is interesting and it always brings to
[38:03] me
[38:05] malthusianism where um there was a um he
[38:09] was actually a cleric somebody from the
[38:11] church um Thomas malus and in the late
[38:14] 1700s early 1800s and he um wasn't the
[38:18] first with this idea I mean some of
[38:19] these ideas go actually back to the
[38:20] ancient Greek um you can see
[38:22] philosophers even from the East and the
[38:24] West that have had this idea that the
[38:26] that there's only like humans will go
[38:28] extinct at something something is going
[38:30] to happen and then there there will be
[38:33] no longer either a need or an ability
[38:36] for humans to continue well malus had
[38:39] this idea that it's in anthropology we
[38:41] call it carrying capacity or in biology
[38:43] that the planet can only sustain so many
[38:46] humans to feed so many humans and he
[38:49] argued in the late 1700s almost 1800
[38:53] that within a 100 years humans would go
[38:55] extinct because we would outgrow what we
[38:57] would be able to produce agriculturally
[38:59] to feed ourselves this I mean diet for a
[39:02] small planet in the 1970s was another
[39:04] case of this and we keep seeing this
[39:06] over and over and over again and
[39:08] everyone talking about how AI is going
[39:10] to replace humans I just see it as this
[39:12] sort of another wave of malthusianism
[39:15] although they're not dealing with you
[39:16] know the planet and being able to be fed
[39:19] but it has to do with the human mind
[39:21] that humans are no longer going to be
[39:23] needed and somebody that interacts with
[39:26] AI who tries to teach my students
[39:29] positive ways to use AI to enhance their
[39:32] thinking as opposed to replacing their
[39:34] thinking we still need human Ingenuity I
[39:37] mean we are problem solvers and so one
[39:40] thing I've thought since I even
[39:42] understood this whole um idea that the
[39:46] planet can only feed so many people is
[39:47] that we are Innovative humans will
[39:50] figure this stuff out and we will solve
[39:52] problems in order to figure that out and
[39:54] I don't in least in this moment and
[39:58] again show me something I'll read it
[40:00] I'll research and I can be changed my
[40:02] mind can be changed but in this moment I
[40:05] don't
[40:06] anticipate the human brain at least
[40:09] within my lifetime being able to be
[40:11] replaced because we still need that
[40:14] Ingenuity and I don't know how you
[40:15] program that I don't know how you
[40:17] program free will I don't know how you
[40:19] program and maybe there are ways to do
[40:21] it but I haven't I have yet to see you
[40:24] know proof of that and I tend to be
[40:26] quite Aristo Ian I I want to see the
[40:29] proof I am a researcher I'm a scholar
[40:32] and I need the proof is in the pudding
[40:34] sort of speak in order to think and we
[40:37] can speculate that's interesting that's
[40:39] fun it's a great discussion but until I
[40:42] see something that's going to change my
[40:44] mind it's hard for me to imagine because
[40:47] being a historian I've seen so many
[40:50] examples over history of this sort of
[40:53] Doom and Gloom for Humanity and it's
[40:55] really it's like the boy who cried wolf
[40:57] it's hard to believe at this point at
[40:59] least for me cool I I love those answers
[41:01] a lot they are really going deep and I
[41:04] think we explain it very well thank you
[41:06] um one other question a little bit
[41:09] change of pace uh who did orange pill
[41:12] whom um well Joel orange peed me um we
[41:16] were actually before we were married
[41:18] this was in
[41:20] 2011 we were in Los Angeles area we were
[41:23] sitting in a Botanical Garden on a bench
[41:26] having a lovely afternoon
[41:28] and he told me about this crazy internet
[41:29] money and my head
[41:31] exploded and um so I have been hearing
[41:34] podcasts in the background and have been
[41:36] hearing about Bitcoin for that long um
[41:40] but I wasn't all in until I'm
[41:42] embarrassed to say more recently than I
[41:45] would want to admit but we all have our
[41:47] journey right and I was in the Fiat
[41:49] world I grew up and I didn't know about
[41:51] money money wasn't talked we didn't have
[41:52] allowance um like for doing household
[41:55] chores it was just responsibility so we
[41:57] didn't get like paid as children so I've
[41:59] never had a healthy relationship with
[42:00] money um I didn't have a lot of money
[42:03] growing up I didn't have a lot of money
[42:04] most of my life and then I got this
[42:06] really cushy job as a tene professor
[42:08] making six figures and I went down that
[42:10] Fiat Rabbit Hole like there's no
[42:12] tomorrow right very very um for the
[42:16] moment spending whatever and now I kick
[42:18] myself because I had heard about Bitcoin
[42:20] for part of that and you know I could
[42:22] have been stacking STS once we you know
[42:24] we early on it was hard to joble tell
[42:26] his story about um trying to get Bitcoin
[42:29] but that's okay I'm really okay with it
[42:32] now which is that fuels my crusade to
[42:35] help the Next Generation to make sure
[42:38] kids don't grow up with that naive or
[42:40] even unhealthy relationship about money
[42:44] and economics that I had so it Spurs my
[42:47] life's work now so I I'm I don't
[42:49] begrudge myself we always have regrets
[42:51] you know if I could go back in time blah
[42:53] blah blah but that's my journey and I
[42:56] you know okay with it and that and I can
[42:58] tell that story and be like yeah so I
[43:02] wasn't all in for a very long time and
[43:04] that's okay because that in itself has
[43:08] given me more conviction today than it
[43:11] would have if I would have just said oh
[43:12] yeah cool and then been all in like my
[43:14] conviction comes from a lot of my own
[43:18] experiences and it's not wavering
[43:20] because of that I just um I'll just add
[43:23] to that that uh you use the word that I
[43:26] use often when we talk about Bitcoin and
[43:29] that's
[43:29] conviction um knowledge isn't something
[43:33] that you attain that's an like an on or
[43:36] off switch it's not something like you
[43:38] ascend the Ivory Tower and now you know
[43:41] everything as if it's bestowed to you by
[43:44] a deity no it's it's a process you go
[43:47] through it like a spiral and you you
[43:51] learn a little bit here and you learn a
[43:53] little bit there and the more you learn
[43:55] about a thing if it's actually real
[43:57] knowledge you gain conviction and the
[44:00] truth was as much as I I I can look back
[44:03] on my journey and say I knew about it
[44:06] early I got it early I knew what the
[44:09] propositions were I knew they were sound
[44:12] what I didn't have was conviction and it
[44:15] wasn't really as much a matter of
[44:17] knowledge it was um a matter of
[44:21] context and and then having the strength
[44:25] of the conviction that drove me to
[44:28] action and so I um and deian and I have
[44:32] often have these conversations about uh
[44:35] forgiving ourselves for not having the
[44:38] conviction earlier enough to to take
[44:41] action and I struggle with that
[44:44] sometimes because I knew about it early
[44:46] enough for it to make a substantial
[44:48] difference in my life but I didn't have
[44:50] the conviction to take action and I
[44:52] think that's something that every
[44:54] bitcoiner is if they're not if they
[44:56] haven't struggled with it yet they will
[44:59] so is is the is this conviction building
[45:03] um uh a time thing and a knowledge thing
[45:07] where it comes from do and and how did
[45:09] you build it it's it's all of those
[45:12] things but I I think at the root of it
[45:14] all is your personal context because we
[45:18] all come from a a history that makes us
[45:23] biased toward certain ideas um or even
[45:27] we are faced with circumstances where we
[45:29] may be too distracted to put in the
[45:32] proof of work to understand what we
[45:34] should do so you know and this is
[45:37] particularly the case if you're in a
[45:38] Fiat job U as Dean and I both were you
[45:42] know we we spend all of our energies
[45:46] trying to exist within that world and we
[45:48] have very little mind space left to to
[45:51] focus on um something that could be
[45:55] beneficial not now but like a decade
[45:58] later so it's absolutely a personal
[46:02] contextual issue but you still in in
[46:07] order to get conviction you have to do
[46:09] proof of work you have to put effort and
[46:13] focus uh and then reach that stage where
[46:16] you can take action and sometimes you
[46:17] can take action without having real
[46:20] knowledge or conviction but this is
[46:22] where people lose their Bitcoin because
[46:23] if they don't really understand it
[46:25] enough to have the conviction they they
[46:27] will not have the conviction to hold on
[46:28] to their Bitcoin or they will be um they
[46:32] will be terrified when they have an 80%
[46:35] draw down and then they'll sell at the
[46:36] bottom that's what it to have conviction
[46:40] is to have enough knowledge to hold on
[46:43] to it even in the worst of times how
[46:47] would you say if if at all uh did
[46:51] Bitcoin impact your your lives did did
[46:54] Bitcoin have some some some impact in I
[46:56] mean of course financially is is is
[46:59] always there because all of the sudden
[47:01] you have the hardest money ever on on
[47:02] your balance sheet that's always good
[47:04] for financially but did it impact
[47:06] something else
[47:07] also U well we're in El Salvador and we
[47:10] wouldn't have chosen El Salvador um so
[47:14] little over a year ago in the states
[47:16] there's been I don't know if anybody's
[47:18] actually seen a news story about this
[47:20] but there's been a lot of political
[47:21] stuff going on in in the states sorry
[47:24] sarcasm um Soh they um when they started
[47:30] going after Trump whether you like him
[47:31] or not that's not the American that's
[47:34] not what our founding fathers um have
[47:37] what they fought for and I've said this
[47:40] before but my family goes back to the
[47:41] Mayflower so I on one side of my family
[47:44] I I am a member card caring member of
[47:46] the Daughters of the American Revolution
[47:47] meaning I have family many family quite
[47:49] a few family members that fought in the
[47:51] revolution I love the Constitution it's
[47:53] the first time in history and since that
[47:57] time that there's been a nation founded
[47:59] on ideas not on war or nepotism or any
[48:04] of these other things where we get
[48:05] nation states that are founded this is
[48:07] was actually founded on ideas this is a
[48:09] principled founding of a country and
[48:11] that means something to me because I try
[48:13] to be a principled person in my life and
[48:16] I grew up with a father who was very
[48:18] deeply um steeped in love of country not
[48:21] because of what it is now but because of
[48:23] that that founding and so when the last
[48:26] for me was when they went after their
[48:28] political rival and I don't care what
[48:30] side you are it's going back and forth
[48:32] and I said I cannot live in this country
[48:33] and watch it fall I love what it was
[48:36] founded on too much to stay so Joel and
[48:39] I decided to move to El Salvador because
[48:41] we're bitcoiners because we saw what we
[48:44] Kelly was doing um last year and we
[48:48] wanted to be in a place where we could
[48:50] live a more Sovereign Life there's more
[48:53] opportunity this is the most OP
[48:55] optimistic place that I on the planet
[48:58] and I hear that from a lot of expats and
[49:00] a lot of people that come to visit El
[49:01] Salvador and that are saying that same
[49:03] message the Salvadoran people are
[49:07] they're responsible they're not going to
[49:08] just want handouts from the government
[49:10] they're out there on the side of the
[49:11] street selling coconuts or little inner
[49:13] tubes down here by the beach and they're
[49:16] all about the hustle and having proof of
[49:18] work to show value they want to put
[49:20] their time and energy into receiving
[49:22] money not just get a handout and there's
[49:26] happiness and joy and optimism here so
[49:29] we came down here to try to live on a
[49:31] Bitcoin standard which we're doing the
[49:33] best we can we pay our rent in a
[49:35] roundabout way we pay our rent but we
[49:37] get our groceries um we pay as many
[49:40] Ubers as we can or or rides because we
[49:43] don't have a car and so we hire drivers
[49:45] but we try to live on a Bitcoin standard
[49:47] and I'm a huge proponent of circular
[49:50] economies because I think that's how
[49:52] Bitcoin spreads is actually using it not
[49:55] just a store of value because most
[49:58] people in the world aren't in a place
[50:00] where they can actually save money yet
[50:03] because of the Fiat system so Bitcoin is
[50:06] our entire world is Bitcoin now um so
[50:10] it's had a huge impact on our lives
[50:11] really cool and when you see um also now
[50:14] El Salvador in you recently with one
[50:16] year move there what what will the
[50:19] impact on on creater Society be when we
[50:22] have this Bitcoin standard I mean in
[50:24] Salvador it's the beginning of the
[50:26] Bitcoin standard it's not a full-blown
[50:28] Bitcoin standard till now uh but you
[50:31] probably can see a window in the future
[50:33] a little bit more than in other in other
[50:35] countries already um what what do you
[50:37] imagine uh the the will look like on a
[50:40] on a Bitcoin
[50:41] standard you mean as a as a whole or
[50:44] just here in El Salvador oh no as a as
[50:47] as a whole like when when the the world
[50:49] is actually getting like oh Bitcoin is
[50:51] the thing and and we live on on bitcoin
[50:53] standard kind of okay so um and I'm
[50:56] really glad you asked this question
[50:58] because uh it's a proposition that just
[51:00] fills me with joy uh there's a lot of uh
[51:03] attempts to characterize El Salvador and
[51:06] I'm just going to use El Salvador as an
[51:07] example I know you mean a larger context
[51:09] but uh in El Salvador they liken it to
[51:12] where Singapore was 40 years ago uh
[51:15] given how um the uh the the for
[51:21] sidedness of the leaders of Singapore at
[51:23] the time led to an economic Renaissance
[51:27] um this little Backwater um you know uh
[51:31] tip of uh an archipelago that no one had
[51:35] thought about suddenly turned into a
[51:38] financial Hub and um and created immense
[51:43] opportunity and and prosperity for its
[51:46] citizens here's the thing though um I I
[51:49] think in that comparison misses the boat
[51:51] uh it it's underselling the potential of
[51:54] what Bitcoin can do and um what we're
[51:57] really talking about here is uh
[52:00] Renaissance Italy Florence in particular
[52:04] the um the economic Revival led to a
[52:09] flowering of of culture is really what I
[52:14] think the um what the ambition should be
[52:18] and I think what the actuality will be
[52:21] because when you take away all the the
[52:24] incentives and and really restrictions
[52:27] that the Fiat system puts on a culture
[52:30] you get all these crazy schizophrenic
[52:35] sociopathic behaviors because the system
[52:38] itself is schizophrenic and sociopathic
[52:41] so that is what the culture results in
[52:45] when you have a monetary system that is
[52:47] sound and hard and true and um and has
[52:51] integrity and requires proof of work and
[52:55] requires um it requires those values
[52:58] from its
[52:59] users what kind of culture could that
[53:02] bring to our planet that is really the
[53:06] um what we should be striving for but I
[53:08] think what will um happen if we
[53:12] succeed and and that's where I think
[53:14] it's going to happen that's that's the
[53:16] direction I'd like to see it's
[53:18] definitely extremely beautiful Direction
[53:21] uh I I have to think um we have in the
[53:25] in the podcast usually endro te uh with
[53:29] two questions the first question is
[53:30] always the question that is same for
[53:32] everyone uh and the second question is
[53:35] coming from the previous guest uh as we
[53:38] have now two guests I thought I give uh
[53:41] the question is always the same one uh
[53:44] to Diana and the second question the end
[53:46] te question uh to Trel uh but feel free
[53:49] to add something if if you want to add
[53:52] something on the other question also so
[53:54] di your question that I asked all my
[53:56] guests uh now is what can we learn from
[54:00] you besides Bitcoin so I'm a teacher so
[54:03] I think that there's a lot you can learn
[54:05] but I would say the impact of reading um
[54:09] and what that can do for you know humans
[54:13] reading um stories classic literature
[54:16] reading all different types of genres
[54:18] because what it does is that it teaches
[54:20] us how to react to other humans it
[54:22] teaches us how to be human and in this
[54:24] world of AI where we start seeing more
[54:26] and more digital where we're just
[54:27] interacting on our phones but not really
[54:29] with face-to-face humans reading these
[54:32] stories we can learn like um I'm having
[54:35] a conflict but I read this book and this
[54:37] is how they dealt with it and I didn't
[54:39] like that outcome so now I know not to
[54:41] do that I can do something else um so
[54:43] for me it would be the impact of stories
[54:46] and trying to connect with them and I
[54:48] know not everybody wants to just read
[54:49] books but even you know some of the
[54:52] greatest works over time whether it's
[54:54] philosophy or reading primary sources
[54:56] history but just um expanding your mind
[54:59] outside of your comfort zone to um
[55:03] become a more robust thinker and even a
[55:07] more robust human in a way really cool I
[55:10] like it a lot reading and even also
[55:13] writing it helps uh like I have writings
[55:17] that I just have for me privately
[55:19] because I like to gather my thoughts and
[55:22] clear them up and writing helps a lot
[55:24] with that uh and I
[55:27] probably never publish them maybe I do
[55:29] some some compilation of that but uh I
[55:31] have to have more time for that if I
[55:33] actually want to publish the things also
[55:35] uh but until now like it just helps to
[55:37] to write things down it's really cool um
[55:40] for you uh dra the Andro te as I said
[55:43] before the end is usually the previous
[55:45] guest is asking a question for the next
[55:47] guest without knowing who the next guest
[55:48] actually is and the question is an
[55:50] interesting one uh how could Bitcoin
[55:52] transform the music and movie industry
[55:55] and how could they use their uh broader
[55:58] audience to Orange peill the world you
[56:01] really um this question actually touches
[56:03] on something that is actually quite
[56:05] personally interesting and um and
[56:08] important to me because I have a uh a
[56:11] film background I went to film school I
[56:14] used to live in Los Angeles uh worked a
[56:16] little bit in the film industry nothing
[56:19] major but I do have IMDb
[56:21] credits and um and so the the the deeper
[56:26] question is how Bitcoin can influence
[56:30] culture and and culture is you know
[56:33] music and film is part of the things
[56:35] that drive culture with film i' I've
[56:38] actually given this quite a bit of
[56:39] thought um Bitcoin does have um some
[56:43] really useful application to um uh to
[56:48] funding the creation of art the problem
[56:52] currently with uh with not just film
[56:55] making but a lot of creative Endeavors
[56:57] is that there are so many Financial
[57:00] barriers to entry it's and with film
[57:02] it's an incredibly expensive medium so
[57:06] you end up having a lot of really
[57:08] passionate people uh choosing to work in
[57:11] that industry for nothing and and you in
[57:14] order to make any kind of impact in that
[57:16] world you have to work for
[57:19] nothing um for at least you know 5 10
[57:23] years before you get anything off the
[57:25] ground
[57:27] how do how can people like that get um
[57:31] get uh a benefit from a Bitcoin ised
[57:35] world and I think
[57:37] that one of the um and perhaps the first
[57:41] use case for Bitcoin is a store of value
[57:43] so if you can um can create uh or if you
[57:48] can save in Bitcoin and be able to live
[57:51] off that for a while you'll be able to
[57:54] pursue your art like you never would
[57:56] have been able to uh have uh pursued it
[57:59] in the past under a Fiat system uh but
[58:02] that's just one way on a personal level
[58:04] I think it also opens up the door to
[58:06] funding mechanisms that we haven't even
[58:08] dreamed of yet uh the ability to um to
[58:13] pitch your ideas outside of the the
[58:18] current system to make what you have to
[58:22] offer open to um to and get past the
[58:28] Guardians of the gate the The
[58:30] Gatekeepers is that is dis
[58:33] intermediating and and that can have a
[58:35] profound change upon the uh um upon that
[58:39] I've got specific ideas I've got broad
[58:41] ideas I think it's a great question I
[58:44] think it will make an important
[58:46] difference in the future wow really cool
[58:49] I love it uh an an unexpected deep deep
[58:53] answer to to that question it was UN
[58:56] Bitcoin touches so many things you know
[58:59] so you can talk about any corner of the
[59:01] universe and that has human value
[59:04] attached to it and find a way that
[59:05] Bitcoin has a connection very very cool
