[00:00] This always happens with any disruptive
[00:02] technology. And part of my research was
[00:04] researching what has happened
[00:06] historically to other disruptive
[00:07] technologies through history. And so I
[00:09] studied the bicycle, the radio, the
[00:12] internet, the automobile. And I found a
[00:14] very recurring pattern. They've shown
[00:16] evidence where it stabilizes grids,
[00:18] where it's mitigating methane, where
[00:20] it's decarbonizing heat by using clean
[00:24] electrical exhaust heat from Bitcoin
[00:26] mining rather than fossil fuel driven
[00:28] heat. Not a single media outlet took up
[00:31] the study. In theory, yes, but in
[00:33] practice, stable coins are highly
[00:35] centralized, so it's much easier for
[00:38] regimes such as Nigeria to clamp down on
[00:40] stable coins, um, as they did. I have to
[00:42] deal with a lot of, let's just say,
[00:44] uneducated takes on Bitcoin a lot of the
[00:46] time. And it's very easy to get
[00:48] frustrated, exasperated, angry even. But
[00:51] the moment you've done so, you've
[00:53] actually lost the most important form of
[00:55] sovereignty, which is sovereignty over
[00:57] your own
[00:58] [Music]
[01:01] mind. You're one of the uh most
[01:04] important figures when it comes to like
[01:06] uh fighting the environmental f
[01:07] especially when in 2021 uh that we that
[01:10] we had. Um now it's seems to be a little
[01:13] bit more silent around that that topic
[01:15] from from outside of the the Bitcoin
[01:17] world and and it's shifting really to
[01:18] the to the positive side. But for the
[01:21] few people that might not know you or
[01:23] unfamiliar with with what you're doing,
[01:25] can you give us a quick overview of like
[01:27] who you are, what you're doing, and why
[01:28] you're excited about Bitcoin? So, I'm a
[01:30] late come into Bitcoin. I really only
[01:33] got involved in
[01:36] 2022. I was a climate tech investor at
[01:38] the time and I started to ask the
[01:42] question about how much impact our fund
[01:44] was having and concluded it wasn't very
[01:47] much. Uh so we went looking around for
[01:49] other technologies that could have a
[01:51] deeper climate climate impact and much
[01:54] to our surprise we found that Bitcoin
[01:56] mining could have a really positive
[01:58] climate impact. But that was not my
[01:59] impression when I first looked at it. Uh
[02:02] because like a lot of people I looked at
[02:04] it and thought it uses too much energy.
[02:06] And it's not doing anything useful other
[02:09] than a speculative asset. it.
[02:11] Thankfully, I uh paused and took a deep
[02:14] breath and decided to do some research
[02:16] and challenge my initial reflexive
[02:18] negative impression of it. uh and as a
[02:22] result I found some counterintuitive
[02:23] truths and ready for my own edification
[02:27] started uh researching it more deeply
[02:30] but shared the research results of what
[02:31] I've been finding and much to my
[02:33] surprise I found a whole whole community
[02:34] of Bitcoiners who I think had been
[02:38] maligned for a long time particularly
[02:40] the Bitcoin mining community who were
[02:42] very grateful that someone from the
[02:44] outside I mean I'm not on the outside
[02:46] now but I was at the time was doing uh
[02:49] independent research looking at the true
[02:51] environmental impact in a datadriven way
[02:54] and coming up with some very different
[02:56] conclusions to a lot of the mainstream
[02:58] narratives at the time which were based
[03:00] on to be frank some pretty shoddy
[03:02] studies and
[03:04] assumptions. How yeah it's it's super
[03:06] interesting. There was this famous um I
[03:09] I forgot how it was called um but
[03:11] basically there was a study that forgot
[03:13] to include the difficulty adjustment and
[03:15] they just made the assumptions without
[03:17] the difficulty adjustment in mind where
[03:18] I'm like that's just lazy if you if you
[03:20] don't even include that or you have an
[03:22] agenda.
[03:23] Yeah, one one or the two. It's always
[03:25] one of those two. Usually it's it's just
[03:27] lack of knowledge, but I would say in
[03:29] maybe one out of five cases there is an
[03:31] agenda. Uh but all you need is one
[03:33] person with a gender and then a whole
[03:35] lot of people who don't do the research
[03:37] who assume that original piece of
[03:39] research was good quality where it
[03:40] wasn't and that's how you get
[03:41] misinformation spreading becoming very
[03:43] prevalent which is exactly what
[03:45] happened. How did you come over that? If
[03:47] you have the impression that that
[03:49] Bitcoin is bad for environment and
[03:51] you're like okay looking at that how did
[03:53] you overcome that? like what what
[03:55] datadriven things that you see that
[03:57] you're like, "Okay, that that actually
[03:58] is not true and it actually is the the
[04:00] the counterintuitive thing." Yeah, I've
[04:03] been wrong about things a lot in my
[04:06] life. Uh and a lot of the times I've got
[04:09] it wrong is when I had an initial
[04:11] impression and I formed a judgment. So,
[04:13] I think just over time and having made a
[04:15] lot of mistakes, I've learned uh that
[04:18] sometimes our initial impressions about
[04:21] things are are not accurate. Some things
[04:25] have counterintuitive truths. I'll give
[04:27] you an analogy. So imagine can imagine
[04:30] if you're at the time of the Capernac
[04:33] revolution and this crazy person is
[04:37] claiming that the earth revolves around
[04:40] the sun. And you say, well, that's
[04:42] obviously nonsense. I can I've got my
[04:44] own senses. I can see visually uh
[04:48] clearly that it's rising in the east
[04:49] every morning and it makes a circuit and
[04:51] it sets in the west. So clearly it's
[04:52] revolving around u the sun is revolving
[04:55] around the earth because our senses tell
[04:57] us this. Um but the counterintuitive
[05:00] truth of course that we discovered or
[05:02] rediscovered was that there are two
[05:04] revolutions. Uh it's revolving around
[05:06] the sun at the same time as it's
[05:08] revolving on its axis therefore creating
[05:10] the illusion that the sun revolves
[05:11] around the earth. So some things in life
[05:14] are counterintuitive and it's only on
[05:16] deeper investigation that that
[05:18] counterintuitive truth emerges and
[05:20] sometimes they're not. Sometimes you do
[05:21] that at deeper analysis and you find
[05:23] out, well, my initial impression was
[05:24] right. But you have to suspend that
[05:26] disbelief. And uh, as I say, I've been
[05:29] wrong about things a few times. And so,
[05:32] I've just learned over time uh not
[05:37] to place too much credence on an initial
[05:40] appraisal of anything. Um, and so my
[05:44] tendency these days, if I haven't looked
[05:46] into something deeply, uh, I'll just I
[05:48] won't make a judgment on it. Uh for that
[05:51] reason I don't make a whole lot of
[05:52] people ask me on my opinion a whole
[05:54] bunch of things and most of the time
[05:56] answer is I don't know because my
[05:58] opinion isn't informed. I haven't looked
[06:00] into it deeply. Uh but when I have then
[06:03] I'm happy to say well this opinion is
[06:05] informed uh by some data and I'm happy
[06:07] to share it. So I think it's just a
[06:10] radical process of um of uh self
[06:13] scrutiny
[06:15] uh and and learning through mistakes
[06:16] over time. And if we can be good at
[06:19] learning from our own mistakes and
[06:21] acknowledging when we make them, uh,
[06:23] then I like to think that it makes us
[06:25] more curious people who are at least
[06:28] less likely to repeat the same
[06:31] mistakes. I I I love that we and it's so
[06:34] hard because we have to
[06:36] normalize saying I don't know. And
[06:39] people sometimes even get upset if you
[06:41] say I don't know because they think
[06:43] you're on the opposite side and you
[06:44] don't want to upset them or whatever is
[06:46] going on. Like if if you for example in
[06:48] the beginning of the Ukraine war I I had
[06:51] no clue about that. I did not look
[06:53] anything up like nothing at all. And
[06:55] people like oh like what was your stand
[06:57] on on the Ukraine war? And I'm like no
[07:00] clue like haven't looked at anything. Um
[07:03] and and they thought like oh like I use
[07:05] some Russian like no like I I really
[07:08] just like never looked at it. And uh I
[07:11] don't know. It's it's this this saying
[07:13] like I don't know. I haven't formed an
[07:15] opinion on that is is seeming not to be
[07:19] something that most people are
[07:21] comfortable doing like it's something
[07:22] unnormal.
[07:24] Yeah. Knowledge of ignorance is also
[07:26] knowledge. And so knowing where you have
[07:29] gaps in your understanding is a really a
[07:31] a precondition to being able to avoid
[07:34] more mistakes, avoid unnecessary
[07:36] judgment, avoid getting into arguments
[07:38] that are unnecessary. uh but also in the
[07:40] context of the work that I do as a coach
[07:42] for example it it's absolutely critical
[07:45] but so if you're CEO of a company you
[07:48] have to know yourself and you have to
[07:49] know your gaps and your areas where you
[07:51] don't know stuff really well because
[07:53] then you can recruit people who know the
[07:55] stuff that you don't know it was exactly
[07:57] the same when I formed CH4 Capital
[07:59] that's our infrastructure investment
[08:00] fund which is doing Bitcoin mining
[08:03] specializing in using landfall gas as
[08:06] the power source to turn it into
[08:07] electricity use it to mine Bitcoin and
[08:09] remote places. Um, do you think I knew
[08:11] about landfills? Do you think I knew
[08:13] about carbon credits? Do you think I
[08:14] knew about Bitcoin mining at any deep
[08:16] degree? And I certainly didn't know
[08:17] about infrastructure financing. So,
[08:19] there really four pretty major areas
[08:21] that I didn't know. But knowing that I
[08:23] didn't know it, uh, meant that I could
[08:26] embark on the task of saying, well,
[08:29] there's two paths. Either I learn about
[08:31] it, that's going to be long and hard, or
[08:33] better, I find people who know the stuff
[08:36] that I don't know. And that's normally a
[08:39] lot shorter and easier. Um, and and
[08:41] that's what I did. And we formed a
[08:42] company who now have those incredible
[08:45] skills plugged. And and my job is not to
[08:49] be the expert on anything. Uh, but to
[08:51] know the people who are and to know when
[08:53] to ask which person the right question.
[08:56] There was an anecdote about Henry Ford
[08:58] which really inspired me and also made
[09:01] me laugh. Apparently, there was a time
[09:03] when the US government was trying to
[09:05] break up Ford Corporation for being too
[09:07] monopolistic. And so, there was a big uh
[09:10] antitrust inquiry and Henry Ford had his
[09:14] three top advisers and he was being
[09:17] scrutinized by some US Senate committee,
[09:19] I imagine, and they were asking all
[09:20] these questions and Henry Ford wasn't
[09:22] answering a single one. He had his three
[09:25] top experts and he just deferred to one.
[09:27] John, Charlie,
[09:29] Fred, and those were pretty much the
[09:31] only three words he said were the three
[09:33] names. And after about 10 minutes of
[09:35] this, this US
[09:37] senator got quite iate and said, "Excuse
[09:41] me, Mr. Ford, I don't mean to be
[09:42] forward, but do you actually know
[09:44] anything about
[09:45] anything?" And to which Henry Ford said,
[09:49] "Sir, it is not my job to be the expert.
[09:52] it is my job to know the people who are
[09:55] and ask them the right question. And I
[09:57] always remember that and I thought
[09:58] that's really good advice because to try
[10:00] to be the expert on everything, you're
[10:02] going to uh crash and burn. And Bitcoin
[10:05] is a
[10:07] uh not just a monetary system, but it's
[10:10] really a I think a Troy Cross describes
[10:14] it as a an epistemological humility test
[10:18] because you have to acknowledge that
[10:19] there's so much about it that you just
[10:21] don't know. And if you pretend you know
[10:25] or you pretend to yourself that you know
[10:26] about it, um you'll be found out pretty
[10:29] soon. And so continuing to be curious in
[10:33] Bitcoin, not just in Bitcoin, but in
[10:35] anything, but Bitcoin is a good test
[10:36] case is really important in terms of uh
[10:40] being able to further your
[10:41] understanding, deepen your
[10:42] understanding, and make a contribution.
[10:45] Yeah, it's it's it's like I've I've now
[10:48] over 500 my 56th podcast and only on
[10:51] Bitcoin like Bitcoin only and I still
[10:53] have every week something like oh like I
[10:55] never thought about that perspective or
[10:57] that I didn't know about that Bitcoin
[10:59] like when does the point come when
[11:01] there's like no new things coming I
[11:03] don't know probably never coming new
[11:05] things coming yeah knowledge is infinite
[11:07] and even within a very very very small
[11:09] subsector of knowledge you're
[11:10] discovering that even that's infinite
[11:12] and even if you could know everything uh
[11:15] then the next minute it would be
[11:16] different because the world would have
[11:18] changed. Absolutely. Uh real quick, I
[11:21] didn't know know that you were coaching.
[11:22] Uh who are you coaching and and what is
[11:24] what is that uh doing? Oh, that's
[11:26] something I've done for a little while
[11:28] now. So my background was with
[11:29] technology companies and then after
[11:31] stepping down from when I'd founded
[11:33] I really worked out that the biggest gap
[11:37] in the whole technology ecosystem
[11:40] was the ecosystem does a pretty good job
[11:43] in training you in the business side uh
[11:46] and training you on the product side and
[11:49] the hyperscaling side. That's pretty
[11:51] good. Um but where it's not so great is
[11:54] really scaling the human side. And
[11:57] sometimes we forget that it's humans
[11:59] that build companies. It's humans that
[12:01] build products. It's humans that create
[12:03] business models and uh the reason for
[12:06] business models being successful or not.
[12:09] And so we don't optimize the potential
[12:11] of the humans both as individuals but
[12:15] also the communication and connections
[12:18] between them. Uh then we're failing to
[12:21] optimize the most important thing in the
[12:23] success of a technology company. So I
[12:26] spent about a decade specializing in
[12:28] training founders um in a bunch of
[12:31] things that I felt were incredibly
[12:33] important based on my own experience as
[12:35] a founder and then branched out and
[12:37] started working with other leaders uh
[12:39] more generally and uh you recently I've
[12:42] been working with some Bitcoiners um who
[12:44] are founding new ventures u some
[12:47] exciting stuff that I can't say too much
[12:49] about right now um but very exciting
[12:51] stuff um and again working on the same
[12:54] thing working on the combination of the
[12:56] skill set, the
[12:57] mindset, a little bit on the strategy
[13:00] and tactics, but that's that's not as
[13:02] important. Um, if you're an athlete, if
[13:05] you're in a football team and you want
[13:08] to win, um, you having the right game
[13:10] day strategy is important. Uh, but
[13:13] having a whole bunch of people who have
[13:15] the skills to be able to execute that
[13:17] strategy is 99% of what's important. So,
[13:21] so I focus on the stuff about the actual
[13:23] ability to execute upon a strategy. Um,
[13:26] the having the right mindset, the right
[13:28] skill set, the right behaviors, the
[13:30] right things you're doing, the actions
[13:31] you're taking on a day-to-day basis.
[13:34] Super interesting. I did not know that
[13:36] about about that uh about you that at
[13:39] all. Um, one thing uh I've I've uh
[13:43] wondered with with the environmental
[13:46] things uh to to come back to that a
[13:48] little bit. Um when we look at uh the
[13:52] the numbers that usually people portray
[13:54] in the mainstream media and now it's
[13:56] getting a little less like that um
[13:58] they're like oh like looking at
[13:59] transaction um costs and they're looking
[14:02] at what energy is consumed per
[14:04] transaction or and then they scale it
[14:06] up. Um what data did you focus on when
[14:09] you first kind of focused on like if if
[14:12] Bitcoin is actually bad or good for the
[14:14] environment and what impact does it had?
[14:16] like what did you see like where Bitcoin
[14:20] is in the environmental impact?
[14:23] Well, the first thing I noticed and this
[14:25] wasn't me noticing it for the first
[14:26] time. Many people had noticed it before
[14:28] and commented on it before is that
[14:29] Bitcoin's energy use doesn't come from
[14:31] its transactions. Uh so this was a
[14:33] madeup metric and to give an idea of how
[14:35] you can make up a metric um let's
[14:38] imagine that you have a car and through
[14:42] the course of a year you like to play
[14:43] your radio in the car. Okay, so you can
[14:47] work out how many emissions your car is
[14:50] creating per year if it's a
[14:52] petrol-driven car. You can work out how
[14:54] many songs you're playing during a year.
[14:56] Therefore, based on this, you can work
[14:58] out the emissions per song that you play
[15:01] on the
[15:02] radio. Right now, you can see the flaw
[15:07] in that. It is very obvious that playing
[15:10] more songs on the radio doesn't cause
[15:12] you to emit more emissions in your car.
[15:16] and and that's obvious and and you smile
[15:18] because everyone knows that. However,
[15:22] with everyone knows how radios work,
[15:24] everyone knows how cars work and
[15:26] everyone knows that the two are
[15:27] independent. Uh but not everyone
[15:29] understands how Bitcoin works. And so
[15:32] because people don't understand that the
[15:34] way the transactions work, that's like
[15:36] playing songs on the radio. And the way
[15:38] that mining's working, that's like
[15:40] driving your car. Um when you say
[15:43] Bitcoin energy use per transaction,
[15:45] people don't go, "What? That's stupid.
[15:47] That's crazy." Uh because into that
[15:49] knowledge gap, uh then all sorts of
[15:51] perversions of of logic and of
[15:54] statistics are possible. And so it's a
[15:56] completely madeup statistic. Now, we can
[15:59] smile at it. Uh but the ironic thing is
[16:01] that that's misinformation is very
[16:04] pervasive. And so right now in the EU,
[16:06] the EU is trying to regulate based on
[16:09] energy use per transactions, a
[16:12] completely madeup, speurious metric. Um,
[16:16] and you don't have to take my word for
[16:17] it. This has been debunked four times in
[16:19] peer-reviewed literature. Anyone who
[16:20] knows anything about Bitcoin mining will
[16:22] tell you the whole thing, the same
[16:24] story. And of course, we know that
[16:25] through the Lightning Network, you can
[16:26] have uh millions, if not billions of
[16:29] transactions, and it doesn't add a
[16:31] single bean to energy consumption. And
[16:34] so that's the first thing that I
[16:35] discovered. But the second thing is that
[16:38] we've kind of got into this pattern of
[16:40] thinking energy consumption bad less
[16:44] energy consumption
[16:45] good. Uh which is just not so because
[16:49] not all forms of energy consumption are
[16:51] the same. So just in the same way
[16:54] imagine if you were overweight you're
[16:56] not. You look in good shape but imagine
[16:57] if you were and you went to a health
[16:58] practitioner said hey I want to lose
[17:01] weight. And the health practitioner
[17:02] says, "Well, that's simple. Eat less
[17:04] food." Now, it's not great advice. And
[17:08] the reason it's not great advice is it's
[17:10] not that for one thing, food's only one
[17:12] component, but put that to one side. U
[17:14] the type of food you eat, I'm sure you'd
[17:17] agree, is more important than the
[17:19] quantity. So, if you're eating a large
[17:21] quantity of lettuce each day, it's
[17:24] actually taking more energy to consume
[17:25] that lettuce than that than the energy
[17:28] you get from the lettuce. So in other
[17:29] words, the more lettuce you eat, the
[17:31] more weight you will lose. Um, so you
[17:33] don't need to decrease your lettuce
[17:35] consumption. You don't need to decrease
[17:37] your consumption of of fruit or
[17:40] vegetables. Um, you may want to decrease
[17:44] your consumption of other forms such as
[17:45] chocolate cake. So in the same way when
[17:48] it comes to consumption of so food's
[17:51] just a form of energy and not all energy
[17:53] sources are the same. They have
[17:54] different impacts. And similarly with
[17:56] energy on the grid, not all forms of
[17:59] energy consumption are the same. If you
[18:02] have a very inflexible type of energy
[18:04] consumer such as an AI data center, uh
[18:07] in fact that's worse than inflexible
[18:09] because it's not only inflexible, but
[18:10] it's energy pattern spikes
[18:13] unpredictably. Uh which makes it very
[18:15] hard for a grid operator to
[18:17] counterbalance. And it also means that
[18:19] because they have very high energy
[18:23] requirements and they can't be down,
[18:26] then you tend to have to back it up with
[18:29] base load sources of electricity which
[18:31] is going to be hydro, nuclear or fossil
[18:33] fuel. And if you don't live in a place
[18:36] which has a lot of rain or gravity
[18:38] combined, you won't have hydro. And if
[18:40] you don't live in a place which has had
[18:41] a lot of investment in nuclear energy,
[18:43] you won't have nuclear, which means your
[18:44] options are limited. So it basically
[18:46] means fossil
[18:48] fuel and there's been a lot of studies
[18:50] that have been done that show that more
[18:52] AI data centers means more fossil
[18:55] fuel-based energy generation is
[18:57] necessary on the grid. So AI data
[19:00] centers that's kind of like your
[19:01] chocolate cake as an energy consumption.
[19:03] Uh Bitcoin mining that's more like your
[19:05] fresh fruit and vegetable. That's
[19:07] exactly the thing you want more of. Uh
[19:09] and again we have a lot of peer-reviewed
[19:10] studies that back this up. the more
[19:12] consumption you have coming from
[19:14] flexible users of energy and there is no
[19:17] more flexible user of energy than
[19:20] Bitcoin mining. Sean Connell calls them
[19:23] the Rolls-Royce of uh flexible load. Of
[19:26] course, you can shut them off and and
[19:28] back on again uh in less than 500
[19:31] milliseconds. Uh they can be shut off
[19:34] for days and they can deliver that power
[19:38] back at a very modular level. you can
[19:41] shut off exactly the amount that you
[19:43] want uh to balance grids which is
[19:45] tremendously valuable. And when you have
[19:48] more flexible energy consumption on a
[19:51] grid, the more you have that means two
[19:53] things. Number one, it means you can
[19:55] reduce the need for gas PA plants, which
[19:58] is these plants you have that just sit
[20:00] and idle all year just for that one peak
[20:03] event where they need to fire up and
[20:05] supply more energy. So you can actually
[20:06] get rid of them. And that's exactly what
[20:07] happened in Texas. uh they didn't need
[20:09] to make a an $18 billion investment in
[20:12] gas PA plants to counterbalance their
[20:14] proliferation of solar and windbased
[20:16] energy. They use Bitcoin mining instead.
[20:19] So that's the first
[20:20] thing. Second thing is that you can
[20:22] build out your grid using more renewable
[20:25] energy because you have this load
[20:26] balancer. So if the sun goes behind a
[20:28] cloud, the wind stops blowing, you can
[20:31] instantly ramp down power consumption.
[20:34] And people say, well, you know, you can
[20:35] use batteries to do that. Well, you you
[20:36] can to an extent, but batteries can only
[20:38] discharge for so long. They like to be
[20:40] discharged the same day. And often
[20:42] battery operators don't have an economic
[20:44] incentive um to do it until the price is
[20:48] really high. In other words, until
[20:49] there's already an emergency, whereas
[20:51] Bitcoin mining companies are much more
[20:53] price sensitive. So the moment wholesale
[20:55] electricity price moves up even a
[20:56] fraction, which is a reflection that
[20:58] demand is increased, they will power
[20:59] down instantly. So they tend to exercise
[21:03] their delivery of power back to the
[21:05] grid. uh much sooner. And the other
[21:07] thing is that sometimes people say,
[21:09] well, that's all very well. They can
[21:11] stop using energy. Is that really their
[21:12] only function? Well, no, it's not. Uh
[21:15] because there's more variable renewable
[21:17] energy on the grid in the first place
[21:19] because they have incentivized the
[21:21] buildout of renewable energy. How? Uh
[21:25] two ways. As I mentioned, by
[21:27] counterbalancing its intermittency, but
[21:28] also being by being a first customer. So
[21:31] in other words, a solar operator, a wind
[21:33] operator, before they even get grid
[21:34] interconnected, they can have a Bitcoin
[21:37] mining company colloccated even before
[21:39] they're grid interconnected, paying them
[21:41] money, which means they're more
[21:43] economically viable. And because they're
[21:45] more economically viable, um they're
[21:47] more likely to get financed. And because
[21:48] they're likely to get financed, then
[21:50] it's a going proposition, which will get
[21:52] grid interconnected. And also because
[21:54] they get profitable sooner, that
[21:56] renewable generator can do what any
[21:58] prudent business operator does, and
[22:00] that's plow their profits back into
[22:02] expanding their renewable operation. And
[22:05] that's exactly what has been happening
[22:07] at scale. And this is no longer theory.
[22:09] We hypothesized about this, but now
[22:11] we've seen evidence of this um around
[22:14] the world. It's one of the reasons that
[22:16] TCO in Japan, uh Japan's largest utility
[22:20] is using Bitcoin mining. It's the reason
[22:22] that Deutsch Telecom is using Bitcoin
[22:23] mining. It's the reason that Kango,
[22:25] who's got into renewable energy, has got
[22:27] into Bitcoin mining. And it's the reason
[22:29] that Urkot is been using more than 3 GW
[22:33] of Bitcoin mining. Uh, and the reason
[22:35] that it's been able to increase their
[22:37] variable renewable energy from 80 gawatt
[22:39] up to 140 gawatt within 3 and a half
[22:41] years. Um, we got 20 scientific papers
[22:45] that back up its numerous climate
[22:46] benefits. We got seven independent
[22:49] studies that do that as well. now. So,
[22:51] the narrative really has shifted. Um,
[22:53] when I was first researching this, I
[22:56] suspected these things were true, but I
[22:57] couldn't really see a lot of evidence in
[22:59] terms of case studies and documented
[23:00] studies uh that were showing it. And so,
[23:04] people said, "Well, that sounds like
[23:05] greenwash." Well, we know now it's not.
[23:07] It's uh it's happening. It's happening
[23:09] at scale and it's happening in many
[23:12] jurisdictions around the world and it's
[23:14] only increasing.
[23:15] So, not only is Bitcoin mining not an
[23:18] environmental problem, we've actually
[23:19] realized that it's a key part of many
[23:22] environmental solutions.
[23:25] That's super interesting. I love how you
[23:28] make it super easy to understand also
[23:30] all those things. Why do you think and
[23:32] the narrative completely shifted in in
[23:34] in in my view it's it's it's light and
[23:37] day from let's say 2021 where I think
[23:41] the peak of it was like El Musk saying
[23:43] he stops the payments because it's it's
[23:45] it's so um uh bad for the environment
[23:49] after he bought Bitcoin like 2 weeks
[23:51] later or something like that. Uh that
[23:53] was kind of peak of the environment uh
[23:56] but then then it just continued from
[23:57] there. Um, and since, I don't know,
[24:00] since Black Row came in the game or like
[24:03] since the last like one one and a half
[24:04] years, you don't hear a lot of that in
[24:06] the mainstream media. Uh, you sometimes
[24:08] hear it with with with uh I I sometimes
[24:11] hear it in my uh friend environment
[24:14] outside of of Bitcoin, but very rarely,
[24:17] honestly. Um, why do you think the
[24:19] narratives actually have shifted? Is it
[24:21] just because now we have evidence of
[24:23] everything and it's like really hard to
[24:24] argue against the evidence or is like
[24:27] Black Rockck and like maybe bigger
[24:29] players like that coming in the game
[24:30] also helping maybe like with America.
[24:33] Yeah, it's not Black Rockck. Um the the
[24:35] change started to take place before so
[24:38] Black Rockck's ETF that was what um
[24:41] early Q1 2024. that the shift really
[24:45] started to happen in Q4
[24:49] 2022 and then Q1 2023 really gained pace
[24:53] and we can actually track this. There's
[24:54] a great organization called uh Bitcoin
[24:57] perceptions that's tracked the change in
[24:59] the narrative so we can pinpoint exactly
[25:01] when the reporting changed. Uh the the
[25:03] big hit piece in the New York Times was
[25:05] really the last major piece of FUD. And
[25:08] I think what happened after that was a
[25:10] few things. So one thing you got to
[25:12] understand is is that this always
[25:14] happens with any disruptive
[25:16] technology. Uh and part of my research
[25:19] was researching what has happened
[25:21] historically to other disruptive
[25:22] technologies through history. And so I
[25:25] studied the bicycle, the
[25:28] radio, the internet, the automobile, a
[25:31] whole range of other technologies that
[25:33] disintermediated not one but multiple
[25:36] different industries. And I found a very
[25:39] recurring pattern which is for the first
[25:42] 15 years or so, the media reception is
[25:45] extremely strong,
[25:48] unbalanced,
[25:49] non-evidence-based, often relying on
[25:52] authority figures uh who are espousing
[25:56] an opinion which is not empirically
[25:58] validated. And then that becomes the
[26:02] common perception. And if we look back
[26:04] through history, we can see some
[26:06] laughable instances of what people
[26:08] claimed um about different technology.
[26:11] So the radio for example when that first
[26:12] came in, so that disintermediated live
[26:14] entertainment, the telegraph, the print
[26:17] media, and records. So four major
[26:21] industries. Now, do you think those four
[26:23] major industries just kind of stood back
[26:24] and said, "Well, here's the radio now,
[26:26] so we'll kind of go out to pasture and
[26:28] we'll accept lesser revenues." Of course
[26:29] they didn't. They wanted to enjoy their
[26:31] incumbency. So they used every tool at
[26:33] their disposal to attempt to put out
[26:36] misinformation about the radio which was
[26:38] widely circulated through the media. And
[26:40] so we got stories such as radio
[26:43] responsible for jailbreaks, radio
[26:46] responsible for birds dying, responsible
[26:48] for snowstorms, uh responsible for
[26:50] antisocial behavior, responsible for
[26:52] suicides. These are actual news
[26:54] headlines we can point to. There's a
[26:55] site, if you don't believe me, look at
[26:57] the uh the pessimist.org, I think it's
[26:59] called, which has documented a long list
[27:02] of how people have responded to
[27:03] different disruptive technologies
[27:05] through time. So, Bitcoin's um you know,
[27:07] ridiculous headlines such as uses a
[27:09] swimming pool of water per transaction.
[27:11] Um you know, we'll look back at them in
[27:13] a few years time, some people looking
[27:14] back at them now and already laughing.
[27:16] Uh it's like, how do we get it so wrong?
[27:19] Again, have we've learned nothing
[27:20] through history? So irrespective of what
[27:24] your opinion is of the media and how
[27:27] reliable you think it is, we can all
[27:29] agree based on historical evidence that
[27:32] when it comes to reporting on disruptive
[27:35] technologies for the first 10 to 15
[27:37] years, it's very
[27:39] unreliable because it's that combination
[27:42] of
[27:43] um disintermediating multiple different
[27:47] industries plus the general human
[27:51] psychological tendency
[27:53] to treat something which is unknown and
[27:56] not well understood with suspicion. And
[27:59] that's just something about human nature
[28:00] which is there for survival reasons.
[28:02] It's not going to change. But it takes
[28:04] time to understand nent technologies.
[28:07] And it takes more than a decade for the
[28:09] media to even start to stop misreporting
[28:13] let alone correctly reporting. So that's
[28:15] a big part of it. And the other part is
[28:18] simply that unfortunately um positive
[28:20] news stories don't make such good
[28:22] headlines. Um the Cambridge report came
[28:24] out a few weeks ago saying that hey
[28:27] Bitcoin mining and by the way to put
[28:29] this in context Cambridge's report on
[28:31] Bitcoin mining is widely regarded by
[28:33] policy makers and regulators the world
[28:36] over as the gold standard of Bitcoin
[28:38] mining. It's independent data driven. Um
[28:41] they go through rigorous scientific
[28:42] methods. They've been out of date for
[28:44] about 3 years. Um, but they've finally
[28:47] updated their data and what this shows
[28:51] is that Bitcoin mining is 52% backed by
[28:54] sustainable energy. They've shown
[28:56] evidence where it stabilizes grids,
[28:59] where it's mitigating methane, where
[29:01] it's decarbonizing heat by using clean
[29:06] electrical exhaust heat from Bitcoin
[29:08] mining rather than fossil fuel driven
[29:10] heat. Not a
[29:11] single media outlet took up the study.
[29:15] Not one. When the Cambridge report, the
[29:17] same report back in 2021 was showing
[29:20] that it was only 37% fossil fuel uh
[29:23] rather 37% renewable
[29:26] energy. Every major news outlet was
[29:29] picking up those reports. So there's
[29:31] also just a tendency in the media the
[29:34] world over that negative news sells
[29:36] better. Um so that creates this
[29:39] phenomenon where you don't have positive
[29:42] reporting at large. You have some and
[29:44] there have been some good positive
[29:46] reports in the media but they just been
[29:48] a vacuum uh where it's just it's Bitcoin
[29:50] and energy is just not a topic that's
[29:52] widely reported on because you don't get
[29:54] the same u sensational headlines anymore
[29:57] that you used to. It's it's opening new
[30:00] fossil fuel plants which it never did.
[30:03] Um, it's giving life to fossil fuel
[30:05] industry, which it never
[30:07] did. It's taking renewable energy away
[30:10] from other people. You could be using
[30:11] it, which it never did because it's a
[30:13] non-rival user of energy. Um, we're just
[30:16] not seeing that sort of headline
[30:18] anymore. Let's take a break for a moment
[30:20] and appreciate the beauty that Coin
[30:23] Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[30:25] watches. Those watches are the most
[30:28] amazing, the most eleigent way of
[30:30] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner.
[30:33] And Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[30:36] completely new and amazing Genesis
[30:38] edition of their watch collections. You
[30:41] have the date of the first ever minded
[30:44] Bitcoin block in there. And of course,
[30:47] also the block height and which epoch we
[30:50] are currently in. I love the level of
[30:53] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[30:56] Make sure to check out those amazing
[30:58] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[31:01] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[31:04] much. And now, if you have Bitcoin, I
[31:07] really do hope that you don't have it on
[31:09] exchange. But if you do have it on
[31:11] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[31:12] deal with that. The first way is you put
[31:15] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[31:17] entry for you to get into the
[31:19] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[31:23] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[31:25] super simple and secure way. And if you
[31:28] check out the link in the description,
[31:30] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[31:33] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[31:36] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[31:39] partner in terms of how to get the most
[31:42] out of your sovereignty. They will
[31:45] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[31:48] that is perfect for your individual
[31:51] situation. They will show you how you
[31:53] can secure your own devices. Securing
[31:56] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[31:58] have to keep all your devices secure.
[32:00] One topic that is overlooked often is
[32:02] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[32:05] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[32:08] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[32:11] place already? And last but not least,
[32:13] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[32:15] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[32:17] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[32:22] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30 minute
[32:25] free call. And just a quick side note, I
[32:28] will be for the first time ever speaking
[32:30] at the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[32:33] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[32:36] really looking forward to seeing all of
[32:38] you there. You can get your ticket in
[32:40] the link down in the description of
[32:42] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[32:45] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[32:48] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[32:50] there. It's super fascinating. It's like
[32:53] it's because um I also try to write
[32:56] headlines with a podcast. Um and I've
[33:00] seen
[33:02] uh especially Bitcoin mining is is
[33:04] always usually a flop. It's it's really
[33:06] hard to sell Bitcoin mining also to
[33:08] Bitcoiners as an exciting topic. Uh
[33:11] mostly number technology or something
[33:13] that points indirectly to number
[33:15] technology obviously is the the thing
[33:17] most are are clicking on. Um and it's
[33:21] it's that sensationalism that is kind of
[33:25] hard to to get through. So So like on
[33:27] the one hand we always complain about
[33:29] that. We're like, hey, we want to find a
[33:31] signal and we want to find things, but
[33:33] then we're all humans and we click on
[33:35] the things that like, oh, like, oh,
[33:36] shock and and things. And I think like
[33:38] if you are these things, we we can't
[33:40] fight that. We just acknowledge that
[33:42] certain things are true about human
[33:43] beings and that's unlikely to change.
[33:45] And we just look at it and say, okay,
[33:47] well, that's that's the way things are
[33:48] and um let's not waste energy trying to
[33:51] uh you know, rewire the way that humans
[33:54] have functioned over um hundreds of
[33:56] thousands or millions of years of
[33:58] evolution. um let's just work within
[34:00] those constraints, understand what they
[34:02] are and seek about trying to re-educate
[34:04] people.
[34:05] I I I like that approach a lot. Um how
[34:08] do you think Bitcoin because has such a
[34:11] unique properties for Bitcoin mining has
[34:14] such unique properties for the energy
[34:15] market. How do you think it will impact
[34:17] the overall energy markets long term?
[34:21] Uh now this is a fascinating
[34:23] topic because coming back to your point
[34:26] around uh why should people be
[34:28] interested in Bitcoin mining? Energy and
[34:30] finance two pretty major systems and in
[34:34] order to have uh a functioning society.
[34:38] We need money that's not broken and we
[34:40] need energy that's not broken. And right
[34:42] now both are broken. Our financial
[34:43] systems are broken but also our energy
[34:45] systems are broken. I think a lot of
[34:48] people understand the bit that money is
[34:50] broken, but fewer people in Bitcoin
[34:52] understand that energy is broken and
[34:54] understand the consequences of that.
[34:56] With me, it was the other way around
[34:58] because I came into Bitcoin mining
[34:59] first. I understood that energy was
[35:00] broken. And then by association with a
[35:02] lot of other Bitcoiners, I was like,
[35:03] "Hang on, what does this Bitcoin thing
[35:05] do anyway?" And that came a good year
[35:08] after my foray into Bitcoin mining. And
[35:10] then I was like, "Hey, this system's
[35:11] also broken. Bitcoin solves a problem
[35:13] here."
[35:15] But coming back to how it's going to
[35:16] change energy markets and why is energy
[35:18] broken at the moment. Uh there's really
[35:21] five things. Bitcoin's highly
[35:24] centralized, fossilized, subsidized,
[35:27] uh politicized, and wasteful. I'm not
[35:30] going to go through all of them in
[35:31] detail, but let's just pick on one or
[35:32] two. When I say fossilized, I don't mean
[35:34] that it's fossil fuel dependent,
[35:36] although it largely is. I mean grid
[35:38] infrastructure is fossilized. It's
[35:40] really old. It's really broken. And you
[35:42] and I right now, uh, which part of the
[35:44] world are you in right now? Uh, Austria,
[35:47] Vienna. You're in Austria. I'm in Costa
[35:49] Rica. Now, we're able to communicate
[35:51] without wires. This is occurring
[35:53] wirelessly. So, I can exchange an idea,
[35:56] a thought, uh, a soundwave, and it
[35:58] reaches
[35:59] you. Now, I can't do that with energy. I
[36:03] can't send you energy wirelessly. I
[36:05] can't say, "Hey, here's um, 52 kwatt
[36:08] hours of energy." And maybe in the
[36:10] future I'll be able to, but not right
[36:11] now. So energy requires wires to move
[36:15] around. And so it's like the landline
[36:18] system was before we had cell
[36:21] phones. If a landline gets cut, it's not
[36:24] going to work. If there's too much
[36:25] congestion on the network, it doesn't
[36:26] get through. The the network gets
[36:27] overloaded. And so around the world, you
[36:30] have these really aging bits of wired
[36:32] infrastructure delivering energy around.
[36:35] tremendously inefficient, tremendously
[36:38] congested, very
[36:40] old, large transmission losses as it
[36:43] transports energy
[36:45] around. Uh, and unfortunately, the way
[36:49] that governments have encouraged
[36:52] renewable energy onto the grids through
[36:54] subsidies has been creating the wrong
[36:56] incentives. because the subsidy and the
[36:58] incentive has not been to deliver energy
[37:01] to people who use it, but to simply
[37:04] build
[37:05] stuff. So, okay, that's great. If I'm
[37:08] going to get a big subsidy of building a
[37:09] solar generation, I can build it
[37:11] somewhere. And where am I going to build
[37:12] it? Where land's cheapest. So, I
[37:13] maximize my returns. Now, what happens?
[37:16] Now, I look at where I built it, where
[37:18] the land is cheap. Now, why is land
[37:19] cheap there? Because no one's there. So,
[37:21] where are the people? Well, not where my
[37:23] solar plant was, because otherwise the
[37:25] land would have been expensive. So
[37:26] they're somewhere else. Okay. Well, how
[37:28] do I get my solar energy from where the
[37:30] land was cheap to where the people live
[37:32] or through the wires through the grid?
[37:34] But the grid's fossilized. The grid's
[37:35] old. The grid needs a substation
[37:37] upgrade. And so you have this problem
[37:39] around the world where subsidies have
[37:41] caused people to build these big
[37:43] renewable energy projects where people
[37:46] cannot access that electricity, they
[37:48] cannot benefit, where it gets congested
[37:50] on the highway of energy transmission
[37:53] through the grid. massive problem. And
[37:56] so then what's happened? Then you've had
[37:58] this backlash where people said, "Well,
[38:00] renewable energy is bad. It's wasteful.
[38:02] It's you it creates white elephants. Uh
[38:05] it's putting power prices up because the
[38:07] grid operator has to pay to cail that
[38:10] renewable operator and we have to use
[38:12] the backup energy anyway. We should have
[38:14] just had more um gas or whatever."
[38:18] Now, those arguments are partially true,
[38:22] but they're not true at a root cause
[38:24] because there's nothing that's not a
[38:25] problem with renewable energy. That's a
[38:27] problem with how renewable energy
[38:29] generation has been subsidized and the
[38:31] type of uh locations that it's created
[38:34] for renewable energy without any thought
[38:36] about upgrading the grid. So, Bitcoin
[38:39] mining comes along and it and this is
[38:41] exactly what happened in Texas. Same
[38:42] thing. All the cheap land and the best
[38:47] wind and the best
[38:49] sun, West Texas. All the people live in
[38:52] East Texas. Aging grid, most of it got
[38:55] curtailed. Backlash was starting to
[38:58] occur. Bitcoin miners came in and they
[39:00] said, "We will take that excess energy
[39:02] that no one else can use. We will
[39:04] colllocate in West Texas." What then
[39:07] happened is it meant that suddenly those
[39:09] renewable facilities that were in the
[39:11] process of getting a backlash against
[39:13] them suddenly they became profitable.
[39:15] They became useful. They didn't have to
[39:16] tell their load. They didn't create grid
[39:18] congestion problems anymore. In fact,
[39:21] because they helped to attract Bitcoin
[39:24] mining operations to them, you now had a
[39:26] benefit which was this amazing load
[39:28] balancing capability and that allowed
[39:31] more renewable generation to be built.
[39:34] Uh so at the point where it would have
[39:36] started to taper off, it's been able to
[39:40] continue and accelerate and proliferate.
[39:42] So it's fundamentally changing energy
[39:44] markets. I say it's politicized because
[39:47] you tend to get these debates and you
[39:49] see this a lot uh where a centerright
[39:52] administration will come in, they'll
[39:54] abandon all the clean energy projects,
[39:56] they'll abandon the subsidies and
[39:58] they'll say we're going to drill baby
[40:00] drill, right? And that people are happy
[40:03] because then you get supposedly cheaper
[40:05] energy and supposedly energy security.
[40:08] And then there's a change and people
[40:11] say, well, that's creating that's
[40:13] contributing to climate change. It's
[40:15] actually more expensive that sort of
[40:16] energy the renewables. We're going to go
[40:18] back to renewables. But they do it in
[40:19] the wrong way. Build them in the wrong
[40:21] places. Give massive subsidies. Use
[40:23] central bank money printing to subsidize
[40:25] them. And so you get this backlash. But
[40:27] then Bitcoin says, "Well, hang on. You
[40:28] can have cheap energy. You can have
[40:29] energy security. and you can have a
[40:31] decarbonized grid all at the same time,
[40:33] but you're only only going to have
[40:35] three. You're only going to have what
[40:36] the political left and right want
[40:37] together if you use Bitcoin mining to
[40:41] counterbalance the variability of this
[40:43] renewable energy sources. Uh, and that
[40:46] way you actually get cheaper energy
[40:48] because yes, renewable energy is cheaper
[40:50] than fossil fuel, but that's only true
[40:52] when it's being used. It's actually more
[40:54] expensive if it's sitting there idle in
[40:56] the middle of some desert um not
[40:58] transporting its electrons to people.
[41:00] Then it's more expensive. So Bitcoin
[41:03] allows renewable energy to deliver on
[41:04] its promise to be cheaper. That's good
[41:06] because it means more energy
[41:08] affordability. Um it means that you
[41:10] always have energy supply, so that's
[41:12] good for energy security. And it means
[41:14] that you can continue to decarbonize a
[41:16] grid, so that's good for
[41:17] decarbonization. So it hits all three.
[41:20] And so irrespective of what your
[41:21] priorities are and what you care about
[41:23] with energy, um, Bitcoin really is the
[41:26] enabler which stops us from this
[41:29] backwards and forwards divisive
[41:31] politicization of energy to be able to
[41:33] look at it much more rationally and say,
[41:35] well, we can have everything. We don't
[41:37] have to make these
[41:39] sacrifices. Um, and that's incredible
[41:42] because it's going to result in more
[41:43] energy abundance, more energy
[41:45] affordability,
[41:47] uh, and cleaner energy for everyone.
[41:49] wondering like like why Bitcoin is so
[41:53] renewable and other industries kind of
[41:54] lack that and if other industries have a
[41:59] disadvantage in that they are not
[42:01] location agnostic. So if you're a a
[42:04] steel factory or an aluminium smelter
[42:07] you can't just colllocate a small
[42:10] operation next to a solar farm. So you
[42:12] will have had that built many years in
[42:15] advance and you're basically limited.
[42:17] you can only use whatever the grid
[42:19] happens to be using. So, same with the
[42:21] banking sector. If you're the banking
[42:23] sector, uh you can only have as much
[42:26] clean energy as the electrical sources
[42:28] you're using, which is the grid that
[42:30] you're using. So, if you're in Paraguay,
[42:32] then yeah, you'll be 100% renewable. If
[42:34] you're in New Zealand, you'll be 83%
[42:36] renewable. If you're in Kazakhstan,
[42:38] you'll
[42:39] be 89% fossil fuel. Uh if you're in the
[42:44] US, you'll be about 40% renewable. So,
[42:47] you're limited by what the grid is
[42:49] using, but as Bitcoin mining companies,
[42:52] you don't have to be on the grid. You
[42:53] can be off the grid. And most of these
[42:55] off-grid operations favor the cheapest
[42:57] form of energy, which generally, not
[42:59] always, but generally is sustainably
[43:01] sourced. So, that's what's enabled
[43:03] Bitcoin to be using way more. It's not
[43:06] that they're trying to do the right
[43:07] thing by the environment. They're trying
[43:09] to do the right thing economically by
[43:10] themselves, which is to source cheap
[43:12] energy, which just happens
[43:14] coincidentally most of the time to be
[43:15] sustainable. Uh but because of this
[43:18] wonderful confluence, um it's driven it
[43:20] to be accidentally uh much more
[43:23] sustainable energy base than any other
[43:25] industry in the world, any other major
[43:28] industry certainly.
[43:30] Is the same true for AI computing or
[43:32] like any sort of cloud computing that is
[43:35] also location independent?
[43:37] Well, that's location independent.
[43:39] However, it needs a much more constant
[43:44] source of electricity because it's not
[43:46] flexible load for the most part. Now,
[43:48] it's becoming more flexible and certain
[43:50] types of AI such as training AI is more
[43:53] flexible, but inference AI isn't. Um,
[43:56] and it's not completely location
[43:57] agnostic because you still need a really
[43:59] good internet connection. You still have
[44:00] latency issues. So, it's not as location
[44:03] agnostic. it's not as modular and it
[44:07] needs a much more steady flow of energy.
[44:09] So you can't, for example, uh put a big
[44:12] Amazon um data center on a landfill or
[44:15] in an oil field or on a renewable energy
[44:19] generation farm or on a solar farm
[44:21] because it's just not going to deliver
[44:23] that consistency of supply. Uh but
[44:25] Bitcoin mining companies, you can. So
[44:28] the the equation is quite different.
[44:29] Interesting. Having said that, you what
[44:31] you can do is you can use Bitcoin
[44:34] mining. And here's the key thing. The
[44:37] key difference between an AI data center
[44:39] and Bitcoin mining, yes, of course,
[44:41] there's var there's differences because
[44:43] one's more location agnostic, but the
[44:45] real difference is actually economic.
[44:47] The real difference is that a Bitcoin
[44:49] mining
[44:50] company, 80% roughly of your operational
[44:54] budget is spent on
[44:55] electricity. AI data center, you're
[44:57] lucky if it's 30%. So the economic
[45:00] incentive for an AI data center to
[45:02] source cheap electricity is much much
[45:04] less than it is for a Bitcoin mining
[45:06] company. So that's why Bitcoin mining
[45:08] companies will be prepared to invest all
[45:10] this capex to chase cheap electricity
[45:13] which may come from an oil field or from
[45:14] a landfill. Whereas an AI data center is
[45:16] not going to do that to start
[45:18] with and then the question comes well
[45:20] hang on a minute but Kruo Energy they do
[45:22] have AI data centers that are operating
[45:24] on oil fields and that's the whole
[45:26] point. they had to do Bitcoin mining
[45:28] first. So, Bitcoin mining comes along,
[45:31] they invest the capex, they act as the
[45:33] catalyst that catalyzes the building out
[45:36] of the the gas collection systems and
[45:39] the generators, which is capital
[45:41] intensive. And then once they've done
[45:43] that and they've fully amortized,
[45:45] they've made their profit, then you can
[45:46] say, well, what else could we be doing
[45:48] with this? Well, we can move these
[45:49] Bitcoin mining rigs onto the next
[45:52] project, the next oil, the next
[45:53] landfill, and we can put in an AI data
[45:55] center now. Or we can have AI data
[45:58] centers in Bitcoin mining in parallel.
[46:00] And rather than having to have two
[46:02] generators for AI data centers because
[46:05] we need a fully redundant generator, um
[46:07] we'll be using the redundant generator
[46:09] for Bitcoin mining whenever it's not
[46:11] being used. But when it's needed, then
[46:13] we'll prioritize it for backup for AI.
[46:16] So there's all sorts of either synergies
[46:18] or catalytic actions where Bitcoin
[46:20] mining comes in first and then helps
[46:22] other users of energy come in second.
[46:24] that would not have happened without
[46:26] that catalyst. So you're seeing um AI
[46:29] and Bitcoin actually having some
[46:32] synergies and not being competition to
[46:34] each other of like uh fields of where
[46:38] where they can do it. Tremendously
[46:40] synergistic potential. It's not to say
[46:43] that sometimes they won't compete to get
[46:45] the same energy.
[46:46] Um, but I think what's likely to happen
[46:49] is that you're going to see AI data
[46:51] centers start to become Bitcoin mining
[46:54] companies because if you, and this
[46:56] happened recently, this happened in
[46:58] Ireland where a large AI hyperscaler
[47:01] wanted to get a contract with the grid
[47:03] operator. They were turned down. And not
[47:05] cuz the grid operator didn't want the
[47:07] money, but they looked at how much money
[47:10] they'd earned. And then they looked at
[47:11] how much it would cost them to upgrade
[47:13] the grid to be able to deliver that base
[47:16] load power and it was going to cost a
[47:19] lot. And then they looked at what their
[47:22] decarbonization goals were and they
[47:23] realized the AI data center would
[47:25] actually stand in the way of them being
[47:27] able to deliver. And so they said no.
[47:28] However, what AI data centers are now
[47:31] looking at is if they use even just 3%
[47:34] of their power for Bitcoin mining,
[47:36] suddenly that entire energy consumer is
[47:39] reclassified as a flexible load consumer
[47:41] because now it can power up and power
[47:43] down. And that little bit of flexibility
[47:46] means that the cost to upgrade the grid
[47:49] is not nearly as much and possibly
[47:51] there's no cost at all. Number one. And
[47:54] number two, it means that the grid
[47:56] operator is able to build out the grid
[47:58] using more variable renewable
[48:00] energy. And that's enabled simply
[48:02] because that AI hyperscaler is using a
[48:04] very small amount of Bitcoin mining as
[48:07] part of its overall load, which means it
[48:10] can win more contracts, but also means
[48:11] that when it has energy that otherwise
[48:13] it wouldn't be using, it can use it for
[48:15] something productive. Interesting. I
[48:17] love the I love the connection between
[48:20] AI and Bitcoin. It's it's two such uh
[48:22] amazing revolutions going on that will
[48:25] change the world in so such an uh
[48:27] impactful way. How do you see the AI
[48:29] actually impacting Bitcoin if at all in
[48:32] in some way? I think just the ways that
[48:34] Michael Sailor has already outlined uh
[48:37] and that people will use AI in order to
[48:39] make inquiries about how you structure
[48:41] your Bitcoin treasuries and how you
[48:43] design new products so you can acquire
[48:45] more Bitcoin. Now probably it's already
[48:47] having impact to trading algorithms. So
[48:50] there will be a two-way impact.
[48:52] Interesting. Um the last topic uh that I
[48:55] want to get into today is kind of the
[48:57] social benefits of of Bitcoin and what
[49:00] are kind of the impacts that that
[49:02] Bitcoin has on us outside of number
[49:06] technology uh or like Bitcoin mining
[49:08] with grid balancing but what does what
[49:10] what is the impact that you're seeing
[49:12] that Bitcoin has on on society on a
[49:15] social level? So when I first looked at
[49:17] Bitcoin, my impression was uses too much
[49:20] energy, useless apart from speculative
[49:22] asset. Turns out I was wrong on both
[49:24] takes. And the reason I was wrong on the
[49:26] second take about it not having any
[49:28] use was not that it didn't have any use,
[49:30] but it didn't have any use that was
[49:32] being reported in media outlets that I
[49:36] was reading because a lot of that use
[49:39] was in areas which the Western media
[49:42] doesn't generally cover such as Nigeria
[49:45] or Argentina or
[49:47] Afghanistan. Uh but if you're in one of
[49:51] those areas where you are
[49:55] unbanked, 1.6 million 6 billion people
[49:58] worldwide are, or is living under high
[50:02] or hyperinflation as quarter of a
[50:03] billion people are, or if you're living
[50:07] in an autocratic regime or
[50:08] semi-automatic regime as 5 billion
[50:11] people are, then the use case for
[50:14] Bitcoin is even more pronounced than it
[50:16] is in the West. Now, it's not to say it
[50:18] doesn't have utility in the west, too.
[50:19] It absolutely does. Uh, I'd be unable to
[50:22] collaborate with a writer in Kenya with
[50:26] my newsletter if we weren't able to
[50:27] transact in Bitcoin and I wasn't able to
[50:29] pay him effectively because try doing
[50:31] that uh translating US dollars or uh
[50:35] Costa Rican colonis
[50:37] into shillings in Kenya. Uh, when you're
[50:41] talking about small regular payments,
[50:43] it's a nightmare and you pay such a lot
[50:45] in remittances. So it removed that
[50:47] friction. So it has tremendous utility
[50:49] in the west. But in the developing world
[50:52] socalled uh it's often survival. If you
[50:56] want to protest against a corrupt
[50:58] government and not have your campaigns
[51:02] uh funds frozen, then Bitcoin's an
[51:05] answer. If you are in Afghanistan and
[51:08] you want to be able to pay women or you
[51:12] are a woman, you want to set up a
[51:13] business uh where 80% of women are
[51:15] unbanked and you have state level
[51:17] discrimination against women saying you
[51:19] cannot open a bank account without your
[51:20] husband's
[51:22] permission then it allows you to bypass
[51:25] that state level um gender
[51:28] discrimination. And if you're in Nigeria
[51:31] and you're seeing political unrest,
[51:33] you're seeing high inflation, high fuel
[51:35] costs, you're seeing the currency value
[51:38] um against the US dollar just
[51:41] tank within 2 years and you want to
[51:44] preserve
[51:45] wealth, then again, Bitcoin provides you
[51:48] a means to do that. And then a lot of
[51:50] people say, well, hang on, don't stable
[51:52] coins do the same thing? Um in theory,
[51:55] yes, but in practice, stable coins are
[51:58] highly centralized. So, it's much easier
[52:00] for regimes such as Nigeria to clamp
[52:02] down on stable coins um as they did to
[52:05] have regulations which say that if
[52:07] you're a stable coin trader, we're going
[52:09] to sue you if you're unlicensed. Uh but
[52:12] then make it almost impossible for
[52:13] anyone to get a license. So, you're
[52:15] effectively suing everyone. You're just
[52:16] making it very frictionfilled to trade
[52:18] stable coins and then you attack the
[52:21] exchanges. Uh whereas Bitcoin doesn't
[52:23] require exchanges in order to be able to
[52:26] transfer Bitcoin from person to person.
[52:28] is peer-to-peer. So because of this
[52:30] decentralized architecture, whilst a lot
[52:33] of authoritarian regimes want to cail
[52:35] its use, they're much more readily able
[52:37] to do that with stable coins. There's
[52:39] always someone you can ring up and
[52:40] pressure. There's a CEO of the company.
[52:42] Um there's all sorts of instruments by
[52:45] which you can still seize and freeze
[52:47] there. There's no CEO of Bitcoin. You
[52:49] can say, "Hey, we want to seize this
[52:51] person's transactions." Uh and that's
[52:53] the beauty of it. It is dictator proof.
[52:55] So we've known this for a while. The
[52:57] Human Rights Foundation has been saying
[52:58] this for a while. Alex Gladstein has
[53:00] been a champion of this message for a
[53:02] while. And so part of my work has been
[53:05] to say, well, to what extent is this
[53:06] happening? And taking some of the my
[53:09] approach, which is to quantify things,
[53:12] saying, well, how often is this
[53:13] happening? How many people are we
[53:15] talking about who are able to preserve
[53:18] their wealth who weren't before because
[53:20] of Bitcoin? How many people in
[53:22] Afghanistan have been able to receive
[53:25] payments as women or set up bank
[53:28] accounts being your own bank using
[53:30] Bitcoin who weren't previously? How many
[53:32] people who were refugees have been able
[53:34] to flee from one country to another and
[53:37] they couldn't take cash across borders.
[53:39] They couldn't take gold across borders,
[53:40] but they could take Bitcoin across
[53:42] borders. And how many people are we
[53:44] talking about who've been positively
[53:46] affected, who've been able to set up
[53:47] their lives from scratch? So, these are
[53:49] the sorts of questions that I'm starting
[53:51] to dig into now. Uh, and it's important
[53:54] that we do because otherwise these
[53:56] stories can get dismissed as one-off
[53:58] anecdotes. Uh, but what we're starting
[54:00] to find is these are not just one-off
[54:01] anecdotes. through every anecdote, every
[54:04] story of every war refugee who flees
[54:07] across the border from Ukraine sets up
[54:09] in Hungary who had
[54:12] $3,000, $2,000, $4,000 in Bitcoin and
[54:16] was able to reestablish their lives.
[54:18] We're finding that there may be hundreds
[54:19] and thousands of other people whose
[54:21] stories are untold. So part of the work
[54:24] I'm doing is to start to quantify how
[54:26] many people we talking about who are
[54:28] already being benefited at an
[54:30] existential level because of the
[54:32] existence of Bitcoin. It's an really
[54:34] interesting one. You you're just at the
[54:36] starting point of that or you already
[54:37] have some some numbers.
[54:40] Well, I can give you kind of a a sneak
[54:42] preview. Um, when it comes to refugees,
[54:44] the early indications, we're talking
[54:46] more than 100,000 people already who
[54:48] have been able to move across borders
[54:50] who because of the existence of Bitcoin
[54:53] have not had to reestablish their lives
[54:54] with nothing financially, but have had
[54:57] something and would not have been able
[54:59] to do this with stable coins, gold or
[55:01] cash of that. I also love um the word
[55:04] you said dictate the proof. It's it's
[55:08] it's a space term and it's a great term.
[55:10] I can't take credit for that but it's
[55:12] that's exactly what Bitcoin is. That's
[55:15] amazing. Um I have one question that I
[55:17] asked each and every one of my guests
[55:18] and the question is what can we learn
[55:20] from you besides Bitcoin?
[55:24] One thing that I I always try to be a
[55:28] good example of
[55:29] myself and that and don't always
[55:32] succeed. Uh but I try
[55:35] is as you can imagine I have to deal
[55:39] with a lot of let's just say uneducated
[55:41] takes on Bitcoin a lot of the time and
[55:44] it's very easy to get frustrated,
[55:46] exasperated, angry
[55:48] even. But the moment you've done so,
[55:52] you've actually lost the most important
[55:54] form of sovereignty, which is
[55:55] sovereignty over your own mind. And so
[55:57] by example, I always attempt, even if
[56:01] I'm responding to something which is
[56:04] nonsense,
[56:05] um, to direct the critique at the logic,
[56:10] not the person, and to make sure that I
[56:13] myself am in a calm state of mind when
[56:15] I'm doing so. And I find by doing that
[56:17] that some people will actually engage
[56:20] with me, some people will change their
[56:22] minds. Uh but at least it allows a
[56:26] conversation rather than a debate. And I
[56:29] think that's been partly why uh a lot of
[56:33] the rebuttals that I've had have been
[56:35] effective has been not getting caught up
[56:38] in debates, not making it personal,
[56:41] sticking to the
[56:42] data, staying emotionally detached as
[56:46] much as possible, and having respect
[56:49] that I'm talking to just another human
[56:51] being who's wrong on this point. I've
[56:54] been wrong, too. And there but for the
[56:57] grace of God go I. I love that like not
[57:00] attacking the person but uh debating the
[57:03] or arguing about the the thing the logic
[57:06] the the the object that we actually do
[57:08] and it's I think a lot of in a lot of
[57:10] debate it's too quickly just about
[57:14] personal attacks all of the sudden and
[57:16] not about the actual thing. So debates
[57:19] are really it's more about entertaining
[57:21] at this point and less about uh actually
[57:24] getting to know a topic. I I like a good
[57:28] debate, but it's it's really hard to
[57:29] find really good debates where you
[57:31] actually learn something and not just
[57:33] getting entertained to root for a person
[57:35] or something like that.
[57:37] Yeah, it's kind of intellectual MMA in
[57:39] many cases, isn't it? Yeah, that's
[57:42] that's a good good comparison. Um, I
[57:46] have an entertaining podcast where the
[57:48] previous guest is asking a question for
[57:49] the next guest without knowing who the
[57:51] next guest actually is. And the enter
[57:53] and the question for you is, "What's the
[57:55] one thing you wish you knew when you
[57:58] first got into Bitcoin that you would
[58:00] like to tell your former self that's not
[58:02] related to buying more Bitcoin?"
[58:06] You you've you've correctly anticipated
[58:08] the answer most people will give if you
[58:10] don't add that caveat. Um, you know,
[58:13] there's actually nothing. Um
[58:15] because whilst there's some things I
[58:17] could say, some mistakes I might have
[58:19] made, some assumptions I might have
[58:21] made, you know, it's all been a process
[58:23] of learning and and I don't regret any
[58:26] of it. Um this whole journey, it's led
[58:29] me to leave New Zealand to live in Costa
[58:32] Rica uh for Bitcoin mining. It's it's
[58:36] completely left a complete pivot in what
[58:40] I've done in my life. But I think if I'd
[58:42] known that from scratch, it might have
[58:43] freaked me out and caused me not to go
[58:45] down that path. So I'm kind of happy
[58:47] that I didn't know. So in the theme of
[58:50] uh sometimes knowledge of ignorance is
[58:53] knowledge. There's some things you're
[58:55] not supposed to know. So I don't think
[58:56] I'd change anything. That's beautiful.
[58:58] Letting the journey unfold how the
[59:00] journey is supposed to be unfolded. Uh
[59:02] really cool. Thank you so much uh Daniel
[59:04] for for for being such a great guest
[59:07] today. Um before uh I I let you go,
[59:10] where can people find you, ask you
[59:11] questions and reach out to you? Yeah, X
[59:14] remains probably the best way at
[59:18] DSbatton. And we have a fund CH4 Capital
[59:22] which is going to be doing some more
[59:23] methane mitigation on landfills. Um
[59:26] that's ch4
[59:28] capital.com. Those would probably be the
[59:30] best two places.
[59:32] Thank you so much for taking the time
[59:33] and also thank you so much for everyone
[59:35] that is watching and listening for
[59:36] joining us today. As always, I'll be
[59:38] back tomorrow with another episode.
[59:40] Bye-bye.
