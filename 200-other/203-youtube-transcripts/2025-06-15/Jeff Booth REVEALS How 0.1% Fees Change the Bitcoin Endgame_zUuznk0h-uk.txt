[00:00] Now take money. It's been the ultimate
[00:02] hot honeypot all of history because if
[00:04] you control money, you control everybody
[00:06] else. The we've never lived in a global
[00:08] free market where you could trade with
[00:10] people all over without an
[00:11] intermediator, right? And the output of
[00:13] that trade was deflation. And if all of
[00:15] your trade is in that system and you
[00:17] were not self-custodying, not not
[00:20] running an economic node and all of
[00:22] these trade, then that system will stop
[00:24] Bitcoin in time because not enough
[00:25] trade. So the little tiny fees from
[00:28] lightning and such that then move down
[00:30] to the miners. So you are an active
[00:32] participant. We trade with each other to
[00:34] achieve more value. That's what the
[00:35] global free market looks like. So if
[00:37] you're going to distort that and stop
[00:38] that from happening through your
[00:40] financial instrument, there's going to
[00:42] be consequences. All of those people
[00:44] become the network. And when I say we
[00:45] are Bitcoin, we really we are that
[00:48] social layer of Bitcoin is the thing
[00:50] that keeps it decentralized and secure.
[00:53] [Music]
[00:56] Hi Jeff, welcome back on the show. Hey
[00:58] Robin, great to see you. Thank you so
[01:00] much for coming back on. It was it was
[01:02] so great. You you were my first big
[01:04] guest and it's almost it's almost always
[01:06] an emotional moment for me because it's
[01:08] like I have 400 episodes between the the
[01:11] first one and now and now you. So thank
[01:13] you so much for for doing that. It's
[01:14] really cool. Well, huge congrats on what
[01:16] you're doing. Thank you so much. Um I
[01:19] know often um when you talk I hear and I
[01:24] often notice that you say we are Bitcoin
[01:27] very often uh and I think it's a really
[01:29] interesting topic the social revolution
[01:31] behind uh Bitcoin. What do you mean by
[01:34] we are Bitcoin? That's pretty deep talk
[01:37] topic and and for Bitcoiners who have
[01:39] spent a lot of time here they'll they'll
[01:41] know what I mean. But when you actively
[01:45] participate run a node um uh spend in
[01:50] Bitcoin, you are the social layer that
[01:52] actually keeps that decentralized and
[01:54] secure. So when you you w I watch the
[01:59] world centralizing makes and measuring
[02:02] Bitcoin and fiat and and all of these
[02:05] things and all of these risks that they
[02:07] think um about Bitcoin when the risk is
[02:11] really about them, what are they going
[02:14] to do? Um because nobody can nobody can
[02:18] force you because Bitcoin is
[02:19] decentralized and secure in the way that
[02:21] nodes are set up. You can actively
[02:24] participate in the honest system and
[02:27] expand the honest system with what you
[02:29] do with what you choose to do. So I like
[02:32] to say that Bitcoin um understanding
[02:35] Bitcoin or once you understand Bitcoin,
[02:37] if you choose the other system, it
[02:39] doesn't say anything about
[02:41] Bitcoin. Says something about you. Um
[02:44] and and once you make that choice and
[02:46] once you commit to that that choice um
[02:50] like you were doing like
[02:52] like you you know all of the people I
[02:55] could name them for it would take me all
[02:58] this podcast to name all the people that
[03:01] are whether Michael Sailor calls them
[03:03] cyber horsets all of the
[03:07] uh fights and um or a bunch of the
[03:10] fights about Bitcoin are in in order to
[03:14] keep its essence that we are it. This is
[03:17] the first time in human history that
[03:19] we've got a chance
[03:21] um to have something decentralized and
[03:23] secure and in other words not live in an
[03:25] exploitive system, live in a a
[03:28] competitive one but cooperative for all
[03:31] of humanity. Um, and it's such a big
[03:33] deal, and I understand when I'm saying
[03:36] this, the vast majority of the world
[03:38] doesn't understand what I'm saying and
[03:40] and will push back because there of of
[03:43] fear and and their existing cognitive
[03:46] dissonance of what this is, what this
[03:48] state change looks like. But once you do
[03:50] understand it, you you can be an active
[03:52] participant. that active participant in
[03:55] the network is the same thing that
[03:59] through the nodes, through the economic
[04:00] nodes, through the through the looking
[04:03] for attack vectors and and being in
[04:07] front of those attack vectors way before
[04:09] they even happen. Um, and building
[04:11] building kind of freedom tech. All of
[04:14] those people what you're doing, teaching
[04:16] other people, starting their journey
[04:19] down, all of those people become the
[04:21] network. And when I say we are Bitcoin,
[04:23] we is really we are that social layer of
[04:26] Bitcoin is the thing that keeps it
[04:27] decentralized and
[04:29] secure. So super interesting. Is is that
[04:32] social layer the the biggest and the
[04:35] most important part of of Bitcoin which
[04:38] keeps it different from any other crypto
[04:40] asset, any other stock, any other real
[04:43] estate, like any other asset basically.
[04:46] Um, you could say lots
[04:49] of I'd get caught in a trap because
[04:51] other people would say, well, the social
[04:52] layer of Twitter or the social layer of
[04:55] this. What what what is different here
[04:57] is is because because of the you you
[05:02] know this, many of you use many of your
[05:04] viewers do, some of your viewers might
[05:06] not because of the way the mining is set
[05:09] up for rewards. Um, and then how they
[05:12] how you can run a node and audit that
[05:15] system and and hold them accountable for
[05:18] the open- source software that you
[05:20] download and you can check everything
[05:22] and you can hold them accountable and
[05:23] audit that time chain every 10 minutes.
[05:26] Um, and then you can spend in it and you
[05:28] can increase the kind of economic nodes
[05:31] that are um uh driving it uh in this.
[05:36] All of those things make you an active
[05:38] participant or not. Um, if you if you
[05:43] buy Bitcoin on an exchange, and I'm not
[05:45] I'm not
[05:47] throwing sand at or darkness or shade at
[05:51] somebody else that is doing that because
[05:53] that might be the first step into the
[05:55] journey. But if you're buying it on an
[05:57] exchange and you're measuring it in US
[05:59] dollars, you're measuring Bitcoin from
[06:01] the system that's centralizing. So
[06:03] you're you're you're giving your power
[06:05] to the centralization because and you
[06:08] you know I've talked about this lots
[06:09] before but if the natural state of the
[06:11] free market is deflation then all prices
[06:13] should fall forever forever. Anything
[06:16] that's stuck anything that creates extra
[06:19] margin anything that feels like isn't
[06:21] abundant will create a swarm of
[06:24] entrepreneurs attacking it with
[06:26] different ideas because of the margin
[06:29] opportunity. So there can't be any
[06:31] monopoly in a free market.
[06:33] can't look like all of the all all of
[06:36] the view of people's world today is a
[06:40] reflection of the system we live
[06:42] in. And what a lot of people are scared
[06:45] of in Bitcoin is it just repeats that
[06:47] system. But it can't as long as it stays
[06:50] decentralized and secure. When I say we
[06:53] are Bitcoin, once you understand that,
[06:56] um, you're never going once you really
[06:58] understand that. I I don't know very
[07:00] many people who have really understood
[07:02] this and then made a choice to go back
[07:04] to the dishonest
[07:06] system and and and because that's what
[07:09] it would have to do. That's what I would
[07:10] have to do. I am not going back no
[07:12] matter what. This is and I know many
[07:16] many people that aren't that aren't. And
[07:19] so on one side people would say well
[07:22] what if Bitcoin goes to zero? Okay, then
[07:24] it goes it goes to zero. But the only
[07:26] way it could go to zero is if everyone
[07:28] chose to go back because so let's talk
[07:31] about some real potential risks to
[07:34] Bitcoin. And I would say that there's
[07:36] two uh two major uh risks to Bitcoin
[07:40] that both of what I what I'm saying here
[07:43] solve. One would be quantum. At some
[07:46] point you could say quantum is never
[07:49] going to happen and that might be true
[07:51] but I would say that that's more of an
[07:52] edge case now that at some point whether
[07:57] through what Microsoft's doing with
[07:59] hardware to be able to make uh
[08:02] uh and and then uh software we will we
[08:06] will likely get to quantum might be 10
[08:08] years might be 5 years might be 20 years
[08:11] um might be never but but I think In
[08:15] something that's this
[08:17] profound, we should take the case that
[08:19] we should take the case that we will get
[08:22] there
[08:22] someday. And we should do the work to be
[08:25] able to um to make the protocol quantum
[08:28] resistant. How do you make the protocol
[08:30] quantum resistance resistant? A whole
[08:33] bunch of people do the work to make sure
[08:34] the best solution is done and it and
[08:37] that solution is f with all of these
[08:39] people going through this consensus
[08:42] mechanism and then you roll out change
[08:45] and who rolls out the change the people
[08:47] that vote for the change that's in best
[08:49] interest of Bitcoin the social layer. So
[08:52] the so uh and and we're doing at ego
[08:56] death we're doing a lot of work on this
[08:57] right now looking at all of the various
[09:01] uh different proposals. So you see okay
[09:04] there's a risk way out here right what
[09:08] should we actively participate in making
[09:10] sure that risk uh uh doesn't
[09:14] materialize. You can imagine there's a
[09:16] whole bunch of other people, not just
[09:17] ego death. A whole bunch of individuals
[09:20] same same as us because of the social
[09:22] layer that are doing the very same
[09:24] thing. What's another risk? Another risk
[09:26] is us. The risk is most people are
[09:30] measuring Bitcoin in the fiat
[09:33] instrument. And if they're measuring
[09:35] Bitcoin in the fiat instrument, they're
[09:37] actually contributing to the
[09:39] centralization. and they don't realize
[09:41] it because and they will get rich
[09:43] because Bitcoin will go up a lot in the
[09:46] fiat
[09:47] instrument and they will probably sell
[09:49] trade their Bitcoin for the fiat
[09:52] instrument and they will they will
[09:55] likely not run nodes. They will likely
[09:57] not part be part of this and at some
[09:59] point that fiat system which is an
[10:01] inflationary system has to attack the
[10:04] honest
[10:05] one has to. So you could just go through
[10:09] a thought experiment. What would you do
[10:12] to to enable that attack? What you would
[10:15] do if you were a government? What you
[10:16] would do is if you were you
[10:19] would be on side with Bitcoin. That's
[10:22] super interesting. And there's this this
[10:24] this
[10:26] increasingly bigger crowd that comes in
[10:28] and only cares about number technology.
[10:31] Uh and then there's the hardcore as we
[10:33] call it the freedom technology. Uh, and
[10:36] I mean I would argue probably 99% of of
[10:39] Bitcoiners or maybe like all of them
[10:42] come in first like because they see
[10:44] number go up and then they learn about
[10:46] Bitcoin. Hopefully most of them actually
[10:48] see the revolution and and what's so
[10:51] fundamental about Bitcoin then later on
[10:54] and then all of a sudden start taking
[10:56] self-custody running their own nodes and
[10:58] and doing actually the hard work of like
[11:00] what it takes to be sovereign on on
[11:02] Bitcoin. That's at least my my hope.
[11:05] And and and that's what people like you
[11:07] are doing with your podcast. That's
[11:10] what we're doing through Ego death and
[11:13] investing in all of the things that
[11:14] protect this and make it make and build
[11:18] functionality on on top of this. we
[11:20] think about this as a as a real
[11:23] revolution where we're building on an
[11:25] honest world and um and and so so it
[11:30] doesn't actually take if you just think
[11:32] about why it feels like that um why it
[11:35] feels like most people aren't like us
[11:38] most people are a number go up and many
[11:40] will be a number go up and and you also
[11:43] some people will make decisions and sell
[11:45] all the Bitcoin and do really well for
[11:46] their families and that's
[11:48] that's okay they don't want the uh that
[11:51] spend the time and go to the next step.
[11:54] Um this is going to be a massively
[11:57] chaotic
[11:58] transition because it has to be a
[12:00] massively chaotic transition to move
[12:02] from a system that we've lived in for 3
[12:04] to 5,000 years that's always been
[12:07] exploitative to a cooperative one. Our
[12:10] most of our minds can't grapple what
[12:12] that means. But now now think about
[12:15] what's happening. what why it feels like
[12:17] what you would say is especially if
[12:19] you're on Twitter, right? It doesn't
[12:21] feel like that as much on Noster, but it
[12:24] feels like that on Twitter because
[12:27] because the majority of people aren't
[12:30] Bitcoiners yet. The majority of the 8
[12:32] billion people on this planet have no
[12:35] idea the first stage the number go
[12:38] up. So they enter they they enter
[12:43] through government saying it's okay now.
[12:45] they enter it, removed a bottleneck. Now
[12:47] they're not fearful of it. And so they
[12:50] start in that giant funnel um way up the
[12:54] top and many of them will move down to
[12:56] where you are where I am today and
[12:58] contribute. It doesn't take 8 billion
[13:01] people contributing to this network to
[13:03] keep it decentralized and secure. It
[13:05] only takes it only takes a small
[13:09] percentage of those people um ensuring
[13:13] that this doesn't this doesn't break and
[13:16] the rest will have to follow. This is
[13:18] actually a question that I have have a
[13:19] lot because we know um most people use
[13:23] things and don't understand how they
[13:25] work like you you drive a car uh you
[13:28] know how to drive a car but most of them
[13:30] don't know how this actually works or
[13:32] the TCP IP protocol I think that's also
[13:34] something we discussed in the first
[13:36] episode uh with you um how many if you
[13:40] had to guess uh if we have like 100% of
[13:42] people in in or on Bitcoin how many how
[13:46] many do we
[13:47] need that truly understand uh Bitcoin
[13:51] and the implications of that. So I did a
[13:54] I put an article on Noster um about a
[13:58] month ago or maybe a little longer than
[14:00] that ago and somebody reach shared it on
[14:02] on Twitter as well and I talked about
[14:04] this from a game theory
[14:06] perspective. Um and and I used the uh
[14:10] and I used the example tied to money. I
[14:12] I'll just share the example here.
[14:16] So, so about 10% of people can't be
[14:20] bought. Um, they I've seen the number as
[14:22] low as 2 and a half% and as high as 20
[14:25] 20%. I actually always I've seen the
[14:28] number more often at 2 and 1/2%. So,
[14:31] let's just use 2 1/2%. And when I say
[14:34] can't be bought, what I mean by that is
[14:36] if you design a playoff matrix payoff
[14:40] matrixes within game theory and and the
[14:43] person cannot get caught, they won't get
[14:45] caught and the reward you just keep on
[14:48] increasing the
[14:49] reward 1 million, 2 million, 10 million,
[14:52] 20 million and you keep on increasing
[14:54] the re reward.
[14:56] Most people 97.5% or 90% will say I have
[15:01] to do it for my family or I have to do
[15:03] it for this. Their their internal
[15:04] dialogue will make a reason to be able
[15:06] to cheat. 2 and a half to 10% of people
[15:09] will will not cheat. What their internal
[15:12] uh dialogue say says uh their um their
[15:17] accountability in themselves won't let
[15:20] them. Right? They're uh and I and I want
[15:23] to be careful here. I don't want to say
[15:25] better, worse, or any anything else.
[15:27] It's just those are the numbers and
[15:29] they've always been the numbers in
[15:31] humans. And so those ask pretty deep
[15:34] fundamental questions. Who are you? Not
[15:37] who is everybody else? What would you do
[15:39] in that exact example? Now take money.
[15:42] It's been the ultimate honeypot for all
[15:45] of history because if you could control
[15:48] money, you control everybody else
[15:51] through cheating, cheating money. And
[15:53] and because people don't notice it, you
[15:56] don't get
[15:58] caught. So So what would the world look
[16:01] like if 97.5% of people wouldn't get
[16:05] caught and they can cheat money and they
[16:06] can create all of our history books
[16:09] about what the world looks like. Look
[16:12] exactly like it has through this control
[16:14] system. And what it would also look like
[16:17] is the 2 and 12% of people would been
[16:20] would have been killed by the cheaters,
[16:23] right? And who do you now when you think
[16:26] about who the 2 and 12% of people that
[16:28] are killed by the cheaters? Who are
[16:30] they? They're actually probably of most
[16:32] of our religious figures. They're
[16:35] probably Gandhi. They're probably Martin
[16:37] Luther King. They're a bunch of bunch of
[16:39] people who stand out as different from
[16:41] everybody else. Really scarce, right?
[16:44] Um, and we celebrate them even today
[16:48] because we want to be like them. It's
[16:52] talking about a higher it's talking
[16:53] about what what humans are reaching for
[16:56] a higher um
[16:59] frequency that they can't that they can
[17:02] they can evolve to but they don't get
[17:03] there. So we celebrate those same people
[17:06] today but we go back to the system that
[17:08] always cheats.
[17:11] Um now two and a half percent of people
[17:15] in Bitcoin running nodes running
[17:17] economic nodes creating creating value
[17:20] is way more than enough people to keep
[17:23] this decentralized and secure way more
[17:25] than enough people. And so what will the
[17:28] most of the people do that have
[17:30] always just gone with whatever they're
[17:33] going to cheat because if they don't
[17:35] somebody else will before them. What
[17:36] will they do in the honest
[17:38] system? They uh they'll be more
[17:42] inclined to be one of the 2 and 12%.
[17:46] be more inclined to and you can see this
[17:48] through Bitcoin's early like this is
[17:51] only 16 years but you can see you can
[17:54] see it through its early evolution to uh
[17:56] today every single person who's cheated
[17:58] the network and by cheated the network
[18:01] tried to accumulate more through a
[18:03] different coin or done this or done this
[18:06] would have been better off if they were
[18:08] just an honest participant the the the
[18:11] truth that that Bitcoin rewards and the
[18:13] the holding and the perseverance of of
[18:15] of just not being fancy with your with
[18:18] your stack and just uh doing the boring
[18:22] accumulating of of of Bitcoin which is
[18:25] really hard for humans to do apparently
[18:27] of just sticking on a stack. So look at
[18:30] look at Roger Ver like charged like he
[18:33] would have been one of the he'd been
[18:35] wealthier than Michael Sailor. They
[18:37] called him Bitcoin Jesus. He he was on
[18:40] the other side of of of the of the 2017
[18:45] trying to centralize uh Bitcoin and he
[18:48] talks about it today and he had to write
[18:50] a book because he's broke and um he's
[18:53] trying to uh to matter again and he
[18:57] talks about it today um and he's
[18:59] rewriting history
[19:02] um because uh
[19:05] imagine having all that and and and and
[19:09] and all of that ability and just side
[19:11] with the honest network instead of
[19:14] trying to consolidate more. Imagine what
[19:17] it would look like him, what what would
[19:19] be going on in his brain when his life
[19:22] looks like it does now compared to what
[19:25] compared to what just being on the
[19:26] honest network would look like. And it
[19:28] would it would create this uh
[19:31] derangement
[19:32] syndrome because and and you'd hate the
[19:35] honest chain just like what's happening.
[19:38] You'd have to tell yourself something
[19:40] that that I was I was the hero trying to
[19:43] say save this. You'd have to create a
[19:45] different narrative um to be able to
[19:48] kind of live with that massive change in
[19:51] what you did. Um and and over and over
[19:55] over and over again you see this you see
[19:58] the FTX you see and we'll see just
[20:01] because 90% of that 97% 97.5% of people
[20:06] will
[20:07] cheat what why this will be chaotic cuz
[20:10] you have to expect it something
[20:12] interesting do you think there will come
[20:15] again a point in Bitcoin's history
[20:18] something like a block size war 2.0 No.
[20:22] Uh not not just uh
[20:26] possibility guaranteed guaranteed.
[20:29] There'll be there'll be all sorts of
[20:31] chaos there. There has to be and there
[20:34] has to be because the systems are
[20:36] incompatible and and most people by most
[20:41] 99.9% are
[20:44] measuring. You've never seen the world
[20:46] that I describe, right? When when I when
[20:48] I keep saying Bitcoin isn't going up,
[20:51] prices are falling against
[20:54] it. That is the free market. And Bitcoin
[20:57] is measuring the first global free
[20:58] market that's ever
[20:59] existed. So, so all of the other why
[21:04] you'd see Trump today and and many
[21:06] people are giving that strength more
[21:08] strength, right? Elon Trump better than
[21:11] Biden uh uh Biden and the
[21:15] globalists in the well that might be
[21:17] true kind of on the surface of it. Um
[21:21] and um because you want to rip out all
[21:23] of the the deep state and everything
[21:26] else. That whole infrastructure
[21:29] apparatus came as a result of a control
[21:33] system printing money. How could it
[21:35] change from that system? he just has to
[21:38] cons consolidate power to somebody
[21:41] else because when when when Elon um rips
[21:46] out a whole bunch of the money the GDP
[21:50] that is all waste
[21:52] today you'll tip the world into an
[21:55] economic spiral a deflationary spiral
[21:58] because all of those people have jobs
[21:59] and all of those people pay for other
[22:01] businesses all their private businesses
[22:03] that also carry jobs and as you do
[22:07] that you'll you'll see the natural state
[22:10] that was there all along and that and
[22:12] and and you'll tip to a deflationary
[22:15] spiral and the US will have to print so
[22:18] much money. Why and and what you're what
[22:20] you're seeing right now is you're seeing
[22:22] why they want Bitcoin is cuz they want
[22:25] to print into Bitcoin and Bitcoin will
[22:28] go up a lot in that. But that system is
[22:30] an inflationary system and that system
[22:32] why they also need their security
[22:35] borders and they need to potentially let
[22:37] go of Europe or or Japan or and they
[22:40] have to they have to control other
[22:42] countries in Canada, me, right, US or
[22:45] Greenland or Panama. They have to have
[22:48] their they have to it has to be a
[22:50] control system. That control system has
[22:53] to centralize more and more. It has to
[22:56] instead of to in in the world we've
[22:59] lived in in the last 20 years where
[23:02] you've had a control system but it's
[23:03] felt like
[23:05] um it's felt like a nice control system
[23:08] because of where you live, right? The uh
[23:11] now now you're just seeing it for what
[23:13] it is. We are going to impose our
[23:15] military might or you're going to do
[23:17] this or you're not going to trade with
[23:18] us. that all that that trade because all
[23:22] humans do
[23:24] um we trade with each other to achieve
[23:25] more value. That's what the global free
[23:28] market looks like. So if you're going to
[23:30] distort that and stop that from
[23:32] happening through your financial
[23:34] instrument, there's going to be
[23:36] consequences. Those consequences are
[23:38] going to to continually to continually
[23:42] accrete and there is no solve from that
[23:45] system. a system that system that
[23:47] inflationary system must be a control
[23:49] system. So that inflationary system has
[23:52] to sometime attack
[23:53] Bitcoin. Um how I would do it. So I
[23:57] would do exactly what's happening right
[23:58] now. I'd convince a whole bunch of
[24:01] people that I'm on side. I love this
[24:02] technology. It's the the best thing
[24:04] ever. You can trust Uncle Sam with it.
[24:07] You can trust us. We're going to do the
[24:09] right thing. Um you can trust co
[24:12] Coinbase with your with your coins. You
[24:14] could do all of this. And then as more
[24:16] and more people did this and more and
[24:18] more of the economic nodes the
[24:20] transmission of this was on top of this
[24:22] I sure wouldn't make the attack anytime
[24:25] soon. But as that happened and more and
[24:27] more people were transacting on my
[24:30] system and and many of the hardcore
[24:33] Bitcoiners of today if if they then sold
[24:39] into that okay I'm out I'm
[24:42] free that I would I would launch the
[24:44] attack later that would that would look
[24:46] like a that would look like a chain
[24:47] split. It's there there's there's so
[24:50] many questions coming up. Uh but but the
[24:53] the biggest one that I always have is
[24:56] what implications and I'm not sure if we
[24:58] actually touched it on the in the first
[25:00] episode uh but what implications Bitcoin
[25:03] in general has on governments because in
[25:06] my head it has to shrink them
[25:09] dramatically.
[25:10] You just na you just nailed it and
[25:12] that's what's that it's what has to
[25:14] happen because so so governments our our
[25:18] whole idea of a government
[25:20] today the we are the map and the to
[25:23] territory I find this fascinating
[25:28] because I think why people have such a
[25:31] hard time one of the reasons why they
[25:33] can't they they visualize the present
[25:37] forward rather than the future
[25:40] And why they do that is they take one
[25:42] aspect AI or something or and they keep
[25:46] every other variable the
[25:48] same and and what they can't see is
[25:50] their own changes from the change and
[25:53] how everything changes from from those
[25:56] from uh from those.
[25:58] So, so if you said that that change from
[26:01] this the the world we live in today is
[26:04] an exploitative control system and it
[26:06] it's a mirror reflection of the world we
[26:10] give our energy
[26:11] to which has theft at the base layer. So
[26:14] of course it would look like that. Of
[26:16] course, the people of of course the
[26:19] people at the top, the greater and
[26:20] greater control structure wouldn't have
[26:22] to provide value to you because they
[26:24] would be sucking the value from you
[26:27] because all humans providing value is
[26:29] faster
[26:30] deflation, faster abundance. So, so you
[26:34] could say one system has to be like
[26:36] this. It has to get worse and worse and
[26:38] and we're measuring that system thinking
[26:40] that that's how government should look.
[26:42] It didn't look like that in the in uh in
[26:44] in the early US. Um a government was way
[26:48] smaller, more free markets, more
[26:51] powerful markets. What what created the
[26:53] the US was the move from from control
[26:57] structures of Europe to open and free
[27:00] markets where there were more ideas shot
[27:02] more more pucks shot on net, more ideas
[27:04] from entrepreneurs that that people took
[27:07] advantage of because they could build
[27:08] their freedom and life in the US. That
[27:11] is what created the US empire that then
[27:13] got captured and that's what creates all
[27:15] more freedom to
[27:17] humans, faster output because of more
[27:20] ideas, faster abundance and then those
[27:23] systems always get
[27:25] controlled. So we're measuring today
[27:27] exactly what you said like this is
[27:29] normal. It's it's completely not normal
[27:32] in a free market. Normal in a free
[27:35] market is a government gets way smaller.
[27:38] It's it has to it's because the free
[27:41] market imposes a discipline and the
[27:43] government has to be in service of you
[27:46] rather than prey on you. And so so that
[27:48] that state change is so
[27:50] massive and we're measuring and and and
[27:53] so in it's interesting and if you pick
[27:56] up on what you're saying and what this
[27:58] is because this is a a whole bunch of
[28:00] people in Bitcoin where you opened the
[28:04] conversation are scared of going to
[28:06] Bitcoin because of the same big
[28:08] government that they're feeding with all
[28:10] of their
[28:11] energy. It's crazy. It's crazy. They're
[28:15] they're they're essentially scream
[28:17] screaming
[28:19] um from a jail cell, right? You better
[28:23] not save
[28:24] yourself because because the big the big
[28:27] guy that we make stronger is going to
[28:30] stop you. It's a super interesting way.
[28:33] How do you h how does then the strategic
[28:36] bitcoin reserve uh and uh countries
[28:40] buying bitcoin is is is that uh
[28:43] basically an attempt to make their life
[28:46] longer.
[28:49] So let's argue just from from both
[28:52] sides. If you were a government, if you
[28:54] were a municipality, if you were a a
[28:57] city and you had an opportunity to not
[29:02] debase your citizens and said you could
[29:05] put some money here and you could buy
[29:07] more services for your citizens forever,
[29:10] wouldn't you want to do if you were a
[29:11] hardcore Bitcoiner? You would probably
[29:13] want to do that because because if you
[29:16] were elected by your citizens and you
[29:17] really cared about your citizens instead
[29:19] of your own
[29:20] power, you would probably want to help
[29:23] the uh help help the citizens because
[29:26] that's what you were elected to do. I'm
[29:28] not saying everybody looks like that,
[29:30] but that would be uh that would be
[29:32] normal. And so that wouldn't be a bad
[29:35] thing at at all because you could you
[29:39] could create that um that
[29:42] value. There are also some people we
[29:45] have to assume there are some people
[29:47] that know exactly what I know exactly
[29:48] what you know and these two systems are
[29:50] incompatible and there's some people
[29:52] inside that apparatus that would try to
[29:54] control it. Why? Because 97.5% of people
[29:59] will. Right? So, so when we're going
[30:03] through this, we can't we we have to
[30:06] look around at our friends. We have to
[30:07] look around at people. And we have to
[30:09] realize everybody is going to make their
[30:11] choices here. That's why it's going to
[30:13] get chaotic and and it's going to be so
[30:16] confusing because we're living at the
[30:18] end of a system that is is grappling for
[30:21] power and it's trying to take more and
[30:22] more control under the optics that it's
[30:25] helping you. and that there's a evil
[30:28] villain on the other side that's trying
[30:31] to trying to hurt you and the optics of
[30:34] that are creating the fear and and that
[30:38] keeping people locked in their jails
[30:40] hell when they could realize wait the
[30:43] doors unlocked I could just walk over
[30:46] here right I could move to the new
[30:48] system and take all my power back and
[30:50] nothing can stop me so so that is bound
[30:54] to be and then inside that there's going
[30:56] to be a whole bunch of other people that
[30:58] say, "Oh, on the new system, I can I can
[31:01] have control." It can be if I was a US
[31:04] and that then um then I could create
[31:07] imperialism 1.0 on gold, 2.0 on on the
[31:11] petro dollar system and 3.0 on Bitcoin.
[31:16] And I could extend the life of an
[31:18] extractive
[31:19] system by by going to Bitcoin. And it
[31:22] would work for a while. It it would
[31:24] work. It would be the right thing to do.
[31:26] But if they if if the U and some of
[31:29] those people will try to control it some
[31:31] of those people because because humans
[31:34] cheat. So the question isn't what they
[31:36] will do. Question is what you will do.
[31:39] Let's take a break for a moment and
[31:41] appreciate the beauty that coin
[31:43] vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[31:46] watches. Those watches are the most
[31:49] amazing, the most eleigent way of
[31:51] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner.
[31:54] And Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[31:56] completely new and amazing Genesis
[31:59] edition of their watch collections. You
[32:02] have the date of the first ever minded
[32:05] Bitcoin block in there. And of course,
[32:08] also the block height and which epoch we
[32:11] are currently in. I love the level of
[32:14] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[32:17] Make sure to check out those amazing
[32:19] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[32:22] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[32:25] much. And now if you have Bitcoin, I
[32:27] really do hope that you don't have it on
[32:30] exchange. But if you do have it on
[32:31] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[32:33] deal with that. The first way is you put
[32:36] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[32:38] entry for you to get into the
[32:40] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[32:44] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[32:46] super simple and secure way. And if you
[32:49] check out the link in the description,
[32:51] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[32:54] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[32:57] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[33:00] partner in terms of how to get the most
[33:03] out of your sovereignty. They will
[33:06] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[33:09] that is perfect for your individual
[33:12] situation. They will show you how you
[33:14] can secure your own devices. Securing
[33:17] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[33:19] have to keep all your devices secure.
[33:21] One topic that is overlooked often is
[33:23] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[33:26] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[33:29] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[33:31] place already? And last but not least,
[33:33] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[33:36] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[33:38] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[33:43] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30 minute
[33:46] free call. And just a quick side note, I
[33:49] will be for the first time ever speaking
[33:51] at the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[33:54] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[33:57] really looking forward to seeing all of
[33:59] you there. You can get your ticket in
[34:01] the link down in the description of
[34:03] Bitcoin Prague and very important use
[34:06] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[34:09] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[34:11] there. Your own personal choice in in in
[34:13] what system and it is actually uh super
[34:16] interesting and I think uh uh I want to
[34:19] touch on that uh because
[34:22] just let's make it on my example like 5
[34:25] years ago I didn't had any Bitcoin. I
[34:27] had no no clue about Bitcoin. Then I
[34:29] started talking about Bitcoin uh and I
[34:32] started to understand the the freedom
[34:34] revolution side of things with with
[34:36] Twitter and podcast and all those all of
[34:38] that. Then I started a business in
[34:40] Bitcoin. Then I said decided to like go
[34:42] all in on on on that uh small podcasting
[34:45] business. Then I got Bitcoin uh
[34:48] companies as sponsors. So I now get paid
[34:51] in Bitcoin. Uh so I have part Fiat and
[34:53] part Bitcoin salary. Uh the next step is
[34:56] like okay I I have now uh two
[34:58] freelancers working for me. Uh one is
[35:01] choosing to get paid in bitcoin and I
[35:03] want to offer that. So so that circular
[35:05] economy is already uh coming that and
[35:08] and I'm I'm seeing how actually my bank
[35:12] account is is getting less and less
[35:14] important in in my life. And I'm like
[35:17] okay I have my Bitcoin wallets. have my
[35:18] setup and I'm just wondering like that
[35:22] transition was really quick and probably
[35:23] I'm I'm I'm I'm not normal because I'm
[35:26] doing like all my life in Bitcoin. Uh
[35:29] but there are so many more people that
[35:31] that do that and and that transition is
[35:33] just fascinating of like uh taking
[35:36] Bitcoin to medium of exchange and uh
[35:38] almost like unit of account uh uh level
[35:42] uh and I'm I'm I'm just fascinated by by
[35:44] how how quick this this goes sometimes.
[35:47] So, Robin, you should tell that story
[35:48] more often because because replicating
[35:51] that story, I I find that probably the
[35:54] number one thing I'm asked is, okay, um,
[35:58] how do I start? What do I do? I all of
[36:00] my energy is in this other
[36:02] system and and I'm and I'm stuck. I need
[36:06] the money and and there's no way I can
[36:08] commit the time. And I think what what
[36:12] your story just uh described Peter
[36:16] McCorbick's story is the same. Natalie
[36:18] Bernau's story the same. Preston Pitch
[36:20] story the same. Lyn Alden's story the
[36:21] same over and over and and and these are
[36:24] just some of the educators and other
[36:26] podcasters other people who have built
[36:29] compelling products on Noster or
[36:31] compelling um on on the entrepreneurial
[36:34] creating more value on top of Bitcoin.
[36:36] This is happening at a at a rate that's
[36:39] hard to describe. And and when you when
[36:43] we're feeding back and we're seeing the
[36:45] results of just moving our time, it's
[36:48] cuz it's happened for me, too. Moving my
[36:50] time from the system that is is
[36:53] exploitative and and and was controlling
[36:56] me. And moving to this, I don't pay any
[36:59] attention to the nonsense in in the
[37:01] other system. I'm I'm aware it's there.
[37:03] I have empathy for the people who are
[37:06] still stuck in jail, but I'm not. And
[37:09] and and and life gets better and better
[37:12] and better because you're in the honest
[37:15] system working with those people in the
[37:17] h on a system and it's a mere reflection
[37:19] of where you're spending your time. So
[37:21] now, how do you start? Because you what
[37:24] you just described is is a perfect
[37:27] example of a process in a free market. A
[37:30] perfect example. One thing's creating
[37:32] scarcity and a whole bunch of pain and
[37:35] you decided to move out of that system
[37:38] to solve that pain for other people to
[37:40] help them because there'd
[37:42] be 7.9 something billion people still
[37:46] stuck in the other system. So that would
[37:48] make podcasting and teaching those
[37:50] people and walking them through kind of
[37:52] because it's complicated. It's it's a
[37:54] state change from system to system and
[37:56] it takes a while to understand. So
[37:58] people like you, people like that that
[38:00] are that are helping people understand
[38:03] uh understand that are helping people.
[38:06] And why are you getting uh why you're
[38:09] getting paid and why you be able to move
[38:10] this is because you're providing value
[38:12] in the free
[38:14] market. Um and we're so early in that
[38:17] value creation. There's tons of
[38:19] opportunities. There's so many
[38:21] staggering opportunities
[38:23] inside the the free and open market
[38:26] that's decentralized and secure and
[38:29] and now I've always been an
[38:32] entrepreneur. So my my bias has has
[38:35] always been to question structures and
[38:38] how could I provide more value. So, so
[38:41] it seems easy for me, but um and and and
[38:46] I I want and maybe it's not easy for
[38:49] everyone, but if you understood kind of
[38:52] the structure of the worlds that you're
[38:54] living in, and one is going to get
[38:56] worse, a lot worse, and and you know,
[38:59] look back 20 years, look back 30 years,
[39:02] and what's happening is are is life
[39:04] getting better and better, or is it
[39:05] getting worse? And you could decide
[39:08] which which and and and on the structure
[39:11] it's going to get way bit worse in the
[39:14] in the existing because it's built on
[39:16] theft because it's built on control
[39:18] because it's built on on that um you
[39:21] won't be able to find place safe enough
[39:24] in that system.
[39:27] um unless you're at the top of that
[39:28] system and I don't think even at the top
[39:30] of that system you're uh you're going to
[39:32] find yourself safe enough from what's
[39:34] what's going to happen which creates all
[39:36] of the value in the other system. So go
[39:39] help like when I watch when I see what
[39:42] you've done in a very short period of
[39:43] time. Um, I think about so Natalie
[39:47] Brunell, I met her at a conference where
[39:50] she had to sneak in on a press pass at a
[39:53] Bitcoin conference, one of the early
[39:54] ones, and she um she couldn't get into
[39:59] one of the parties. Um, and I'm I'm
[40:02] thinking, how am I allowed in the party
[40:05] and she isn't? Um, because because they
[40:08] didn't know her. She was she was early
[40:09] in her journey. And she used that and
[40:12] she said, I'm going to create a podcast.
[40:14] I'm going to teach people what this is.
[40:16] She moved from old
[40:18] media to creating her own uh her own
[40:21] just like you've done. And and look at
[40:23] the value she's both created and and
[40:27] delivered to audiences around around the
[40:30] world. Look how many people she's
[40:32] helped. And so her business is is just a
[40:35] testament to her making a choice. And
[40:38] that's I I see over and over and my
[40:41] entire network is filled with those
[40:43] people. So when people ask me, "How do
[40:45] you do this?" And I'm I'm watching all
[40:48] of these people do it. There's there's
[40:51] there's abundant opportunity. Start a um
[40:56] start a Meetup group. Start meeting
[40:58] people locally who also have shared
[41:00] similar interests. Find what else needs
[41:02] to be built. Find out where people are
[41:04] having pain understanding on this.
[41:06] either teach or build something, use AI
[41:09] to build something on top that provides
[41:11] value to people, you'll find tons of
[41:13] opportunity. That's uh I I can do 100%
[41:16] agree to that. Um is there something um
[41:20] still feared in your life that you would
[41:22] like to get rid of?
[41:24] I think so where I am in in BC um I
[41:29] can't be 100% uh and I don't think I'm
[41:33] not saying and that's catching myself um
[41:39] it's hard to be 100% Bitcoin in in
[41:43] everything. So buy houses, buy
[41:44] groceries, my grocery store doesn't uh
[41:47] doesn't accept Bitcoin yet. And so how
[41:49] can I accelerate that? I can give a nod
[41:52] to businesses that do accept Bitcoin and
[41:55] I can and I can spend my money there. So
[41:57] I do that. I spend in Bitcoin every day
[41:59] but I can't spend all in Bitcoin every
[42:02] day. I um in Ego death it's because of
[42:07] the fund dynamics and probably this is
[42:08] probably through regulation. I can't
[42:12] accept salary yet in in in Bitcoin. It's
[42:14] a fiat fiat and then a lot of those
[42:17] companies then convert the fiat we give
[42:20] to bitcoin and then then as they get pro
[42:23] more
[42:23] profitable they accrete bitcoin on the
[42:26] balance sheet um so this transition uh I
[42:30] think also takes time when I said we're
[42:32] the map and
[42:33] territory we influence the things that
[42:36] we want to win and that's what I'm doing
[42:38] I'm influencing the things that I want
[42:40] to win I'm giving it giving a nod to
[42:42] businesses that take Bitcoin and I would
[42:44] prefer to spend Bitcoin every day. And
[42:47] then and then I'm also helping in places
[42:49] like if you said Pierre Poliov in in
[42:52] Canada who have helped
[42:54] understand the this this process a lot.
[42:58] So he um uh a lot um Ken Sim is a friend
[43:03] in Vancouver who's just tried to or is
[43:06] trying attempting to make Bitcoin
[43:08] Vancouver the um on the map as a as both
[43:12] on their balance sheet and kind of a
[43:14] real Bitcoin city which helps
[43:18] me spend more in Bitcoin. How do you
[43:20] look at um credit? Because when
[43:25] you I'm now at a point where I'm like uh
[43:29] spending bitcoin and as I said I'm I'm
[43:31] I'm I'm uh also paying uh a freelance in
[43:35] bitcoin. Um and I don't like to use
[43:38] borrowing against bitcoin or credit or
[43:40] anything like that. I I actually like to
[43:42] use bitcoin as it is. But sometimes uh
[43:46] it almost feels foolish not to use
[43:48] credit and and that feared games uh on a
[43:52] high degree to maximize in the end of
[43:56] your Bitcoin stack. And I mean there are
[43:58] multiple that that do that uh companies
[44:01] I mean strategy is is one famous example
[44:04] uh but also individuals that do that. Uh
[44:07] but it but credit is also a fiat thing
[44:10] or is that something that also could be
[44:12] on Bitcoin? So it's more of a fiat the
[44:17] system is a credit based system. So the
[44:19] a credit based system can't allow
[44:21] deflation because the deflation would
[44:24] that deflation spiral would collapse the
[44:27] credit based system. So when people
[44:29] think about credit today um they they I
[44:32] think they conflate
[44:35] uh those two things. Um so if the system
[44:38] is a credit based system then everything
[44:40] has to be credit it has to be more and
[44:42] more credit or the and you have to
[44:44] increase the amount of credit or debt um
[44:47] or the whole thing collapses and that's
[44:50] where we are in the system problem
[44:51] today. Um so then individually and how
[44:55] would that system operate? So how would
[44:58] the existing system operate? It would
[45:00] mean that
[45:01] um in inflation is wage deflation. So
[45:05] your wages are going down. But the other
[45:08] side of that is if you had debt, it's
[45:10] also going
[45:11] down because the inflation makes the
[45:14] debt cheaper over
[45:16] time. And that has to so taking massive
[45:19] bets loans against that. That's why
[45:21] houses have created so much value
[45:23] because they've become value. Instead of
[45:27] being a utility value, they're a hold um
[45:30] they've become a money and you have to
[45:32] hold your wealth and money because you
[45:34] can't hold your money and money your
[45:36] wealth and and and money. So you take on
[45:40] more debt and if you have massive
[45:42] amounts of debt, if you have if you're
[45:45] the backbone of the system and the
[45:47] government will always press a button to
[45:49] be able to make you resolve your problem
[45:51] like in JP Morgan or any any bank any
[45:54] financial institution that's a then then
[45:57] if you if you create this massive you uh
[46:01] back on the system and you own all of
[46:02] these
[46:03] assets and they'll always press a button
[46:06] to inject more liquidity.
[46:08] you extract everything from everybody
[46:10] else. So that's what that system looks
[46:13] like. And then then what you're talking
[46:17] about here is in the other system
[46:21] uh deflation is natural because the
[46:24] natural state of the free market is
[46:26] deflation. And as more people enter that
[46:29] as as as we do more with AI, as we do
[46:32] with more with robotics, you'll have
[46:34] faster and faster deflation. That means
[46:36] any debt if you're using the mental
[46:39] model you used to
[46:41] use to that debt that debt it'll get
[46:43] cheaper over time because of inflation.
[46:46] In the new model that debt will get more
[46:48] expensive over
[46:49] time and and somebody is going to
[46:53] pay, right? If you actually if you lent
[46:57] it out your Bitcoin and and they
[46:59] couldn't pay, right? you're going to
[47:02] have to either take their business, take
[47:04] their assets, take their um and so many
[47:08] people are going to get confused by this
[47:09] because it's a really complicated topic
[47:12] measuring that system change from the
[47:14] system you're measuring from because
[47:16] it's exactly
[47:17] opposite. Um, credit cannot look like it
[47:21] does in the new system
[47:24] um the way it does. It it look it
[47:27] eviscerates most of the credit. I'm not
[47:29] saying credit isn't here. It's just way
[47:32] smaller because as a as a user of
[47:34] credit, you have to decide. Um, can I
[47:38] pay this back in a in in something where
[47:42] prices are falling faster and faster and
[47:44] faster, making that debt more expensive?
[47:47] Now, if
[47:49] you're there's all sorts of tricks and
[47:52] Micro Strategy is one of them, and I
[47:53] think they're going to do a good job of
[47:56] using the existing system as an attack
[47:59] against the
[48:00] new. But be very careful. Um, if you're
[48:04] if you're levering your Bitcoin, be very
[48:06] very or if you're trusting somebody else
[48:08] to leave your your bitco bitcoin, be
[48:11] very very careful because this is going
[48:13] to this is going to wreck a lot of
[48:14] people.
[48:16] Yeah, I I I try to stay in in in in
[48:19] Bitcoin and just as a savings tech
[48:21] technology and don't don't do with
[48:24] credits. Thinks it's a a safe and great
[48:26] strategy.
[48:28] Um think think about what you just said
[48:30] is so you have a you have a 45% IRR for
[48:34] the last 15 years. So So and
[48:38] non-counterparty risk. So, holding in
[48:40] self- custody, um, if you if you just
[48:43] hold for any length of time, you have a
[48:45] 45% IRRa. If you're if you're buying a
[48:49] house, you have maybe an 6 or 8%. Um, if
[48:54] you're uh if you're any other, so you
[48:57] cannot get a compound. The only thing in
[48:59] the world that is that rate of return is
[49:02] Bitcoin. Um, and it's not counterparty
[49:05] risk. It has zero counterparty risk to
[49:06] the existing system. So what are people
[49:09] doing? It's which seems crazy. I'm
[49:11] trying to increase my IRRa from
[49:14] 45%. To take risk inside the other
[49:18] system that has all of the it has all of
[49:20] the
[49:21] risk. So So how you're thinking about it
[49:24] as savings technology is I think the the
[49:26] the best thing you could teach. Um, it's
[49:30] the um it's this it's the the risk-free
[49:35] rate of the world today is
[49:38] 45%. If I don't think I can beat that,
[49:41] right? Um I wouldn't invest and in fact
[49:44] we use this calculation at ego deathath
[49:47] um in in the only because the only way I
[49:50] think I can beat that is either what
[49:52] micro strategy is doing lever this and
[49:55] and play that game through through uh
[49:58] shorts longs um and and hedge out my
[50:01] risk
[50:02] um or uh or build companies that provide
[50:06] value in the free market and accumulate
[50:08] Bitcoin on their balance sheet um uh by
[50:11] by doing so and then you're having
[50:13] essentially venture returns on top of a
[50:15] venture asset.
[50:18] H that's that's super interesting uh
[50:21] because because I look at that and like
[50:24] why why would I take any any any
[50:26] additional risk as long as my Satoshi
[50:29] number goes up uh every month or every
[50:32] quarter or every year that that that's
[50:35] the best I can do.
[50:37] Totally. Um uh I want to go uh back one
[50:42] more time to to the medium of exchange
[50:44] uh side of things. Um do do you think
[50:47] med exchange and and unit of account uh
[50:51] is required for the the Bitcoin story
[50:56] and and for the store of value story?
[50:57] because I I asked that intentionally
[50:59] because I make community polls polls a
[51:02] lot uh um on on my YouTube channel and I
[51:07] see a lot of people still struggling
[51:11] with using Bitcoin outside of uh just
[51:16] just as a savings technology. So if
[51:18] Bitcoin isn't a medium of exchange, it
[51:21] will fail as a store of value. So if you
[51:23] are not using as a medium of exchange
[51:27] then you're relying on somebody else or
[51:28] a lot of other people to use it as a
[51:30] store of value
[51:32] um to be able to protect your wealth and
[51:35] it so if so again it come back it comes
[51:38] back to you what are you making the
[51:40] decision may maybe you get away with it
[51:43] because a whole bunch of people already
[51:45] made the same call that you are Robin
[51:47] that I am and using it as medium of
[51:49] exchange maybe you get away with it and
[51:50] that's just Okay. Um, but you have to
[51:55] because the systems are
[51:57] different, right? The we've never lived
[51:59] in a global free market where you could
[52:01] trade with people all over without an
[52:03] intermediate area. Um, and the output of
[52:07] that trade was deflation. And think
[52:10] about why that output of that trade has
[52:12] to be deflation. You are part of the
[52:14] network. You only, and I'm not saying
[52:16] Bitcoin here. I'm saying you're part of
[52:18] any trade. You're part of the fabric.
[52:20] And you only choose things that give you
[52:22] more
[52:23] value. And all
[52:25] entrepreneurs have to compete with and
[52:27] provide more value. So, and they have to
[52:30] compete with what was there before
[52:32] otherwise you won't use them. So, that
[52:35] global trade has to be
[52:37] deflation. So, you're a node in that.
[52:40] Now, if you take your power and you give
[52:42] your power away to somebody else and
[52:44] say, "I'm not going to I'm just this
[52:46] network and this other one is
[52:48] inflationary and it stops that from
[52:51] happening, then that system has to stop
[52:54] Bitcoin at at some point." And if all of
[52:57] your trade is in that
[52:59] system and you are not self-custodying,
[53:02] not not running an economic node and all
[53:05] of these trade, then that system will
[53:07] stop Bitcoin in time because not enough
[53:09] trade, not enough. So the little tiny
[53:12] fees from from lightning and such that
[53:15] then move down to the miners. What if
[53:18] all of those fees are in the centralized
[53:20] system? What will the miners choose? So
[53:23] you are an active participant in this.
[53:25] So when people like the simplest thing
[53:28] you could just repeat repeat if Bitcoin
[53:30] fails as a medium of exchange it fails
[53:32] as a store of value
[53:34] period it will be captured say it over
[53:37] and over and over again for anybody
[53:39] who's not listen and eventually
[53:40] hopefully enough people will get it and
[53:43] why just like in Bitcoin running a
[53:46] node they should contribute or they they
[53:49] they ought to contribute to the network
[53:52] that's also providing them their store
[53:55] of value. It makes uh it makes a lot of
[53:58] sense. Uh and and once you are in in
[54:01] that deep, you're like, "Oh, like it's
[54:03] it's
[54:05] almost a no no."
[54:07] This is this is why specifically if you
[54:11] think about what what Roy is doing at at
[54:13] Breeze um what what Obie is doing at
[54:17] Fetty what uh Cashew as well but if you
[54:20] um if you look at all of these
[54:22] technologies that allow more payments in
[54:25] this in a way that doesn't centralize
[54:29] um you know you pro people really need
[54:31] to understand the tech to understand how
[54:33] it doesn't centralize but if they use
[54:35] breeze open source and how the routing
[54:37] nodes are done and how it uses lightning
[54:39] or liquid or or eventually arc. It
[54:42] becomes a layer that that you can just
[54:45] plug in and optimize your business for
[54:49] payments. Um and and and by doing by by
[54:54] doing that you contribute to the nodes
[54:57] that are you contribute to the network
[54:59] that's that's decentralizing. And
[55:02] there's a bunch of other
[55:04] companies that will centralize like if
[55:07] you said
[55:09] like I'm not going to name them here but
[55:11] they uh but some of the big big tech
[55:13] companies will have to will try to
[55:15] centralize some of the big Bitcoin
[55:17] companies will try to will try to
[55:19] centralize and you could um so for
[55:22] people who understand this deeper and
[55:24] and people who are making decisions on
[55:26] which tech stack to
[55:28] use it would be I think it's an
[55:31] important
[55:32] uh part of the the criteria in in them
[55:36] thinking through the decisions of the
[55:37] the tech stack they're using to accept
[55:39] payments and then and people using
[55:42] payments similar I I have one more topic
[55:45] uh before we come to the end team today
[55:47] um uh and it's an interesting uh
[55:51] hopefully an interesting one uh you give
[55:54] a lot of calmness and confidence to a
[55:57] lot of people uh and we were both
[55:59] together also on the on the uh PDC
[56:02] sessions live stream with with Ben and
[56:04] uh and and Ken uh as you mentioned the
[56:06] the mayor uh was also there and Ben said
[56:10] something interesting always when he has
[56:12] doubts he he he calls you and and and
[56:15] and gets a lot of calmness also from
[56:18] you. Um uh do you have sometimes doubts
[56:23] uh around your theory? And uh second one
[56:26] is like what how did you get so so
[56:30] confident or what makes you so so so
[56:33] convinced of it? A lot of work. Um a a
[56:37] lot of work. And then um to to be able
[56:41] to essentially try to kill this. So some
[56:44] of the examples I'm using are are are
[56:48] work that I've done for a lot how I look
[56:51] at this is the system has to be chaotic
[56:54] to transition. It must be cuz we've
[56:56] never lived in this system. Nobody has a
[56:58] mental framework for what I'm talking
[57:00] about. And so what I'm but but what I'm
[57:02] talking about is true, right? Is we know
[57:06] that the natural state of the free
[57:08] market is deflation. We know that
[57:10] productivity um should accelerate. We
[57:13] know that that that means we should be
[57:15] living in an abundance. All of those
[57:17] things are true. They're just not from
[57:18] the existing system. Then I go to then I
[57:21] go to okay if we've never lived in this
[57:25] system but many bright lights throughout
[57:27] time Nola Tesla Henry Ford um
[57:32] Buckminister Fuller many others talked
[57:36] about how this would work but couldn't
[57:39] get there from from the technology that
[57:41] we we we used to have and we always fell
[57:44] back into our worst
[57:47] selves. we um then what would make me
[57:50] believe that this time what could be
[57:52] different. So my bar on this time is
[57:55] different is probably way higher than
[57:57] most people's bar and it forces a con
[58:00] and it forces me to attack every one of
[58:02] these problems because the problem isn't
[58:04] everyone else the problem is
[58:06] us problem isn't everybody says those
[58:09] people those people and they're giving
[58:10] their strength away and it's there is no
[58:13] they it's just
[58:14] we so we we make choices and I've
[58:18] already made I guess what makes me
[58:20] confident in this I've made my choice
[58:24] I know what system I'm going to and and
[58:27] I don't I don't begrudge other people
[58:29] for their choices. I don't need to get
[58:31] mad at it. Just is. It's going to be
[58:33] chaotic and confusing. It just is.
[58:35] Right. But I've made my choice and
[58:39] nobody can take my choice from me. Um,
[58:42] that's what that's what gives me conf
[58:44] and and every day my choice feeds back
[58:47] to me in feeling like it's the right
[58:50] choice and and hopefully a whole bunch
[58:52] of other people you um all of the other
[58:55] people you know who have made the sim
[58:57] similar choice are making the similar
[58:59] similar choice be um because they know
[59:03] what the choice means. And so now once
[59:06] you understand
[59:07] that you you don't have to be mad at
[59:09] other people like I I think I really
[59:11] honestly the humility and and I think
[59:14] about myself 10 years ago
[59:16] or 9 years ago before I knew that all of
[59:19] this and I think about the choices I
[59:21] made then and if somebody told me what
[59:22] they're what I'm saying now I probably
[59:25] have a hard time seeing it from that per
[59:27] who that person was at that time too.
[59:30] So my mind has changed through through
[59:32] this and my mind is deep and and and
[59:35] then my life has gotten it's not my life
[59:38] was great before before but what I see
[59:41] and and and how much uh that's
[59:44] reflecting back and how much fun I'm
[59:46] having and what it looks like in my life
[59:49] as it imp it hopefully impacts other
[59:52] people positively too and then their
[59:53] lives possibly too and their family's
[59:55] lives. It makes me feel like I'm on the
[59:58] right path.
[59:59] So, so, so, so why um why is
[60:06] it I don't think there's anything that
[60:09] can shake that. Like, I just don't think
[60:11] like because I'm ready for all the
[60:14] chaos. I'm ready for everything that
[60:15] else that that that happens. I know it's
[60:18] part of it. Um but but that chaos can't
[60:22] drag me back into it. It can it can
[60:25] attack me but only I can I control my
[60:29] own mind. I control what I give energy
[60:31] to. I love that. And I usually ask uh
[60:34] two Andrew question. The the uh the one
[60:37] comes from the previous guest. One comes
[60:39] from what we can learn from you besides
[60:41] Bitcoin. Uh and I think this was already
[60:44] a good answer to to the last one. What
[60:46] what we can learn from you besides
[60:47] Bitcoin. Do you want to add anything
[60:49] here? No. No. I I feel like for for some
[60:53] people, and I'm sorry, it it feels like
[60:55] I it for me it it feels like I say the
[60:58] same thing over and over again. Um but
[61:00] uh but I guess you almost have to in a
[61:05] in in a world that's 8 billion people
[61:07] that don't misunderstand what's what's
[61:09] happening.
[61:11] Absolutely. Um we have the the question
[61:14] the last question of today um from the
[61:16] previous guest. So the the previous
[61:17] guest asked a question for the next
[61:18] guest without knowing who the next guest
[61:20] is and your question is what do you
[61:22] think is your most valuable contribution
[61:24] to Bitcoin?
[61:26] Uh I would say the uh the work I do now
[61:30] with uh with helping entreprene
[61:33] entrepreneurs achieve their dreams in in
[61:36] in creating value on top of it on top of
[61:39] this uh uh protocol or I'd hope that's
[61:43] uh that's so a lot of the things that we
[61:46] will see develop and use every
[61:49] day came out of ideas that were in ideas
[61:55] and brains. s that then had lots of risk
[61:57] and and and
[61:59] uh and and challenges that then were
[62:02] funded and created not just funded but
[62:05] kind of working shoulderto-shoulder with
[62:07] entrepreneurs who are are trying to
[62:09] bring their their value to society.
[62:12] Interesting. Yeah, I I think that's
[62:14] really really really great. Um one uh um
[62:18] asked all my guests like where they can
[62:20] find you. It's it's usually uh Twitter,
[62:23] but I think with you it's it's now
[62:25] primarily already NOS, right? Yeah. I'm
[62:28] only uh I haven't been on Twitter
[62:31] in almost a year, actually over a year.
[62:34] Uh so so I I still I have my account. I
[62:38] don't check it very often. I I check I
[62:40] account for for spaces uh and and such.
[62:43] Uh but but most of my time is on Noster.
