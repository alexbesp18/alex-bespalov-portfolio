[00:00] Bitcoin is the only Fu money right and
[00:02] actually without Bitcoin you can never
[00:03] have Fu money an amount of well so big
[00:05] then you can basically do whatever you
[00:07] want you can say what you want total
[00:09] freedom I think he was one of the first
[00:11] guys that kind of like looked at this
[00:14] whole thing of inflation as being like a
[00:16] direct violation of property rights and
[00:18] that every time a king did such a thing
[00:20] the citizen had the right to cut the
[00:22] king's head and you know the day money
[00:24] is a tool right it's not the end goal
[00:26] fortunately what I think the money does
[00:27] to our brains as well is that kind of
[00:29] like reinforces this idea that money is
[00:32] the end gold rather than than tool it
[00:34] gets more and more difficult to do any
[00:36] kind of attack on bitcoin and you you
[00:38] need to take into account as well the
[00:40] fact that if you fail to do that Bitcoin
[00:42] will become even stronger whatever
[00:44] actions put more money in people's
[00:46] pockets the better at the end of the
[00:53] day what are you doing in Bitcoin and
[00:55] and like kind of what excites you the
[00:57] most in Bitcoin so in right now I work
[00:59] in
[01:00] new Bitcoin mining pool called demand
[01:03] it's a stratum V2 um and um I can give
[01:08] you my history my background in NHL
[01:12] after the economics and finance so here
[01:14] in
[01:15] Portugal um
[01:18] basically I I learned a lot of that
[01:22] kesian crap um so I was told that
[01:26] inflation was good that uh you needed in
[01:29] order for the for the economy to work
[01:31] all that kind of stuff and um back in
[01:34] 2020 so the first time that I heard
[01:36] about Bitcoin was actually back in
[01:40] 2017 uh back then I was working on a
[01:42] broke on a financial brokerage uh firm
[01:46] and um
[01:47] basically uh we had a lot of clients
[01:50] asking us like how does how does this
[01:53] work why is Bitcoin like Rising it
[01:55] actually I think back then 2017 was the
[01:59] so not the previsible market the one
[02:01] before the the last one so we had a lot
[02:04] of clients that were that wanted to know
[02:07] and wanted to to understand what was
[02:09] going on with with Bitcoin but back then
[02:11] uh I of course I didn't have the
[02:14] knowledge that that I have today so um I
[02:19] I was just like what's what's the use
[02:22] case of this what's what's the the issue
[02:24] what's the problem that this is solving
[02:26] because I think
[02:27] that's that's the main reason why people
[02:29] cannot figure it out or cannot
[02:31] understand why why Bitcoin is important
[02:34] why it plays a role right because it's a
[02:37] solution for a problem for a problem
[02:38] that most people don't don't know that
[02:40] they have um and yeah back then I I had
[02:43] a bank account everything worked fine uh
[02:46] so uh like I said I studied in in in
[02:49] University that inflation was necessary
[02:52] in order to to have a healthy economy so
[02:55] um yeah never I I just um I just didn't
[03:00] care about it I remember I I I did some
[03:02] research in order to once again clarify
[03:05] my my client Styles but um yeah just
[03:10] just didn't didn't look very very into
[03:13] it and um three uh so yeah this was 2020
[03:20] um I was working in um Financial
[03:23] basically an investment bank here in
[03:26] Portugal and um one of the guys that I
[03:28] was working with uh there was one day
[03:31] that he came and he was like guys you
[03:34] have to check this out Bitcoin is going
[03:35] to change the world and um when once I I
[03:40] hear that I was like all right I need to
[03:42] give this another try I need to to study
[03:44] this better um so I decided all right
[03:48] I'm gonna I'm GNA read a book about it
[03:51] and I I ordered the Bitcoin standard and
[03:53] I remember that um yeah I was reading it
[03:56] and it it all started like clicking in
[03:59] my head because during my University
[04:00] days I I kind of like had some Neo
[04:02] moments per se where I kind of like felt
[04:05] that everything that I was being taught
[04:07] was kind of like uh a light in a sense
[04:11] or or very super superficial in a sense
[04:14] because I remember um when I was like 16
[04:18] 17 my my family has a small business and
[04:21] I remember my my dad used to being do
[04:25] being um used to do like these types of
[04:28] experiments kind of like the research
[04:29] and development let's say program within
[04:32] a company uh and um he was doing like
[04:36] all these experiments with the goal of
[04:39] saving costs for the company of course
[04:42] and in my head um that would turn out
[04:45] into one of three things either more
[04:48] profits for the company more wages for
[04:52] uh bigger wages for for our workers and
[04:55] uh lower prices for for our our final
[04:58] customers so this whole thing about um
[05:02] prices rising as as time goes by didn't
[05:06] never kind of like clicked in my head um
[05:10] I remember as well like during the
[05:12] lectures like un the the professor
[05:14] talking about the potential GDP like the
[05:17] natural uh employment unemployment rate
[05:21] and um these uh we're talking about
[05:25] abstract Concepts it's not something
[05:27] like it's not something um like physics
[05:30] right like uh like a heart science that
[05:33] you can like you that you know that what
[05:36] you're talking about actually is
[05:38] happening in the real world so I I had a
[05:40] lot of these NE moments and when I was
[05:42] reading the Bitcoin Center it kind of
[05:44] like started clicking on me and remember
[05:45] that it was during the the war passage
[05:49] so kind of like understanding that it's
[05:52] so much easier for governments to fund
[05:53] Wars with with Fiat money that I was
[05:55] like all right this is going to change
[05:58] the game completely this is going to
[05:59] change the world and I need to to
[06:02] understand this better and uh I felt
[06:05] like I need I I had to play a a role on
[06:08] it on this transformation on this
[06:10] revolution that that that is basically
[06:12] happening so in a nutshell I would say
[06:15] maybe a quite a long
[06:17] introduction I I love that but it it's
[06:20] one one aspect I I loved the most was
[06:23] when you talked about the economics
[06:25] being like almost like a fake science
[06:27] department because I see it
[06:30] I see like Satoshi put put the science
[06:33] back into economics and put it like like
[06:36] as a real thing in there before it was
[06:39] kind of like a pido science thing where
[06:41] we people just trying to figure out what
[06:43] to do and um they all just made it worse
[06:46] over the time and Satoshi kind of
[06:48] brought science and and math and the
[06:51] real uh uh things back into economics I
[06:56] I like that approach yeah we always had
[06:59] like
[07:00] good economics right we're talking about
[07:02] uh Austrian economics and even before
[07:06] them with the Scholastics and uh um
[07:09] forgot the name of the school but um
[07:12] yeah um you know there was a a school
[07:15] that kind of like initiated this this
[07:17] this type of thought but um the kesia
[07:20] the kesian ideas actually just um kind
[07:23] of like uh went mainstream after the the
[07:27] great uh the Great Depression before
[07:30] then yeah actually there there was no um
[07:35] there was no let's say um kesian
[07:39] economics per se so it was it was mainly
[07:43] the Austrian economic thought and um
[07:47] like more RI rism economic thought that
[07:50] kind of like dominated back then so um
[07:53] yeah it's it's not like we're we're
[07:57] living of course if if those guys that
[07:59] lived back in the 19th century uh kind
[08:02] of like um managed to to to come to to
[08:08] 2025 and see what we are um I think they
[08:12] they would they would they would go back
[08:14] in into their um into their sorry I
[08:20] forgot the the name of it but not into
[08:23] the into their graves yeah because they
[08:25] couldn't they wouldn't they wouldn't
[08:26] manage to they couldn't believe what
[08:30] they were seeing it's super interesting
[08:33] um
[08:34] also I just I just Googled it next to it
[08:37] I never heard about it is it the school
[08:38] of Salam monka yeah yeah School of
[08:40] salanka you have ju
[08:43] Marana I think it was one of the first
[08:46] guys that kind of like looked at this
[08:48] whole thing of inflation as being like a
[08:50] direct violation of property rights and
[08:53] that every time a king um did such a
[08:56] thing the citizen had the right to cut
[08:59] the king's head so yeah so very very
[09:05] different thoughts let's say uh I love
[09:09] that I'll uh I can uh I can it's like
[09:15] the long before Kanga scholar like Louis
[09:20] de molo and Diego
[09:25] deos Kos I don't know how to pronounce
[09:28] that name uh argu that value is
[09:30] determined by individuals not by in
[09:32] intrinsic properties that that's like
[09:34] it's really cool I never heard about
[09:36] this the school of salaman why why why
[09:39] did I never heard about that yeah that's
[09:41] basically the origin of the Austrian
[09:43] School of Economics so this this this
[09:47] whole idea of like money being uh stable
[09:49] and something that nobody no one can
[09:52] control uh it's not something that uh
[09:55] came with the ostrin so it it it has
[09:57] been present for uh um all all history
[10:01] and um yeah unfortunately with with
[10:03] kanes and kan's
[10:05] ideas um they kind of like disappeared
[10:09] uh especially because of the the role
[10:11] that acade Academia plays in our society
[10:13] unfortunately um what happens is that
[10:16] anyone that wants to study economics at
[10:19] least let's say in the the major
[10:21] universities the only thing that they
[10:22] are taught is is kesian economic so it's
[10:25] kind of like you have like you're only
[10:27] taught half of the story right
[10:30] um and uh when you're 16 or 16 17 18 you
[10:34] don't have a very critical view of of
[10:37] society so you kind of just like look at
[10:38] the professor and you swallow everything
[10:40] that that uh he says um and uh you you
[10:44] never ask yourself wait a second is this
[10:48] is this correct um is this like really
[10:52] correct what what what my professor is
[10:55] is saying you just assume that because
[10:57] he's he's kind of like I'm not to say
[10:59] got but he's like the it's like a the
[11:03] reference point for you right when
[11:04] you're 17 18 you don't have any life
[11:06] experience you're just absorbing
[11:08] everything that he says because you just
[11:10] assume that he's the one that kind of
[11:12] like owns the the truth interesting do
[11:15] you know why the austan school of
[11:18] Economics is kind of got more
[11:20] popularized around that and the salaman
[11:23] one is like uh more in the background
[11:25] now and I never it's super interesting
[11:28] for me to hear
[11:29] it principles are very similar so I'm
[11:32] not an expert per se in economics
[11:34] history but I I know that like I said
[11:39] the the austrians thought is is is very
[11:42] inspired and based on what um Sala
[11:45] School uh on on Sala School principles
[11:50] and their their their thoughts probably
[11:53] also because it's um more recent like
[11:55] manger and stuff like that they came
[11:59] after that and maybe that's why really
[12:01] interesting um yeah thank you for for
[12:03] really interesting introduction I
[12:05] learned something new today um which
[12:07] gets more and more um rare in a on a
[12:10] daily Bitcoin podcast with now 400
[12:12] episodes the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole never
[12:14] ends man
[12:15] that's that's something that I've been
[12:18] learning that's something that I've
[12:20] learned for for these past
[12:23] years gu you yeah yeah like I I've been
[12:28] complete
[12:29] I've I thought I understand Bitcoin well
[12:32] before I started the podcast now 14
[12:34] months before I started this daily
[12:36] podcast uh and I've interviewed now over
[12:40] 400 people on this podcast uh um and I
[12:45] learned so much like my like I I I I got
[12:48] to know that I didn't knew anything
[12:49] before and and now I'm like every week
[12:53] stumbl on on a new topic and like School
[12:55] of Salam Mona never heard about that
[12:57] like it it seems like it's a no braer
[12:59] that I should know about it uh but I
[13:01] never heard about it uh so that's that's
[13:03] interesting um what I wanted to ask is
[13:06] like what are some some interesting
[13:07] rabbit holes that you are currently
[13:09] looking into in Bitcoin or like that you
[13:11] stumbled upon like in 2094 2025 I mean I
[13:14] would say definitely the Bitcoin mining
[13:16] per se that's I mean this yeah Bitcoin
[13:20] mining so um there's a lot of things
[13:24] that most people don't know about
[13:25] Bitcoin mining uh for instance um
[13:29] I would
[13:30] say that actually the the biggest
[13:33] concern that we have right now in
[13:35] Bitcoin the biggest problem that we need
[13:36] to solve is the fact that um miners are
[13:38] not the ones actually building the block
[13:40] templates so probably already had a
[13:43] couple a couple of guests that talked
[13:45] about this but uh in a sense uh what is
[13:48] happening right now in the Bitcoin
[13:50] network is that miners are kind of like
[13:52] more like employees of the pools rather
[13:54] that than being like employees of the of
[13:57] the network directly
[13:59] um and that's of course uh a problem the
[14:04] that's an issue and why is is that the
[14:06] case because the major or one of the
[14:09] major value propositions of Bitcoin is
[14:10] being censorship resistance right you
[14:12] want to send your money and nobody can
[14:15] basically stop you right even if there's
[14:16] like a minor that is uh censoring
[14:19] transactions you know that for sure that
[14:21] uh the guy that mines with the next
[14:23] block is going to include it so even if
[14:26] if he if you don't if a transaction
[14:29] doesn't get included in the next block
[14:30] you have to wait a little bit longer but
[14:32] it's going to get included it's going to
[14:34] get included um in in a few
[14:37] blocks um and um why why is this a big
[14:43] issue because in a sense pools are the
[14:46] ones that have the power to to select or
[14:50] to determine which transactions going to
[14:52] the
[14:53] block uh So currently there's like I
[14:58] don't know five six pools then represent
[15:00] 85% of the total hash rate so once again
[15:06] if there's like let's say a government
[15:09] like the US government that wants to I
[15:12] don't know due to some reason let's say
[15:15] that uh yeah they suspect that a certain
[15:18] that there certain address belongs to
[15:22] someone from Iran or North Korea or
[15:25] something like that they can just uh
[15:27] basically Force f which is the biggest
[15:29] pool right now to say all right
[15:32] transactions from this address you you
[15:35] want you want include them in your
[15:37] blocks in your in your blocks and what
[15:39] happens is that for that person in
[15:40] particular he will only have like 60% of
[15:43] the the block space available for for
[15:46] that transactions to get to get included
[15:49] so yeah I would say that's
[15:53] definitely um something that for what
[15:56] I've seen and for what I've been uh
[15:58] talking with with other bitcoiners most
[16:00] people are not aware and we need to
[16:02] solve that uh and that's actually what
[16:05] what I'm working on uh right now
[16:09] um uh I would say that besides the the
[16:13] Bitcoin mining like ravit Hall I've been
[16:16] digging into uh libertarian philosophy
[16:19] and libertarian books so I've been
[16:22] reading actually I'm reading the ethics
[16:24] of Liberty by muray roart and um it's
[16:27] it's a really funny exercise to kind of
[16:29] like um study on your own and try to
[16:32] figure out how uh fully um anarco
[16:36] capitalist system would work so and uh
[16:40] yeah it's it's it's quite it's quite
[16:42] interesting to to to look into this
[16:44] because for instance people assume let's
[16:47] say for instance taxes and Social
[16:49] Security and all of that you just assume
[16:51] that um you have you have to pay your
[16:55] taxes right because that's like the only
[16:57] way for you to to help some went out um
[17:01] but what happens in the sense when you
[17:03] when you when you pay taxes is that you
[17:06] you are Outsourcing that responsibility
[17:08] of helping um other people to the state
[17:12] so we are social we are social persons
[17:15] right we're social people we we like to
[17:18] to belong to we like to to belong to
[17:21] groups and be part of a community so
[17:26] what ends up happening is that
[17:29] probably if you didn't have taxes you
[17:31] kind of like felt that it's my duty to
[17:34] help others right so if if I'm working
[17:37] and let's say that I I I provided value
[17:40] to the market I've I've managed to to
[17:43] produce wealth for myself or to
[17:45] accumulate weal for myself since I I I
[17:49] did that and there's someone that like
[17:51] next to me that I feel like um needs
[17:54] help probably uh I mean I I cannot I
[17:57] cannot speak for everyone right but I I
[17:59] would say that most the vast majority of
[18:01] people would would help that person so
[18:03] what happens in a in a in a system where
[18:06] you have taxes in where you where you
[18:09] basically have a government that is
[18:10] saying all right you just pay me and I
[18:11] take care of that responsibility in
[18:14] society people in a in a sense end up um
[18:18] being more more uh more selfish because
[18:21] they're like yeah I I have that
[18:24] responsibility I have that duty to help
[18:25] someone else but since I paid taxes to
[18:29] the government so now if you need help
[18:32] you have to talk with the government
[18:34] because I already did my part you know
[18:36] what I mean so there's kind of like a a
[18:38] disconnection
[18:40] between um yeah
[18:42] between between all members of society
[18:45] regardless of you like being with having
[18:48] more wealth less wealth because the
[18:49] government kind of like Steps between
[18:51] steps in and uh inserts itself like
[18:54] between us and uh what what ends up
[18:57] happening as well is that the
[18:58] relationships between us are not as as
[19:02] close as as they as they should be so
[19:06] that's that's uh another rabbit hole
[19:08] that I've been digging that I I find
[19:10] that I find very very interesting as
[19:12] well I partnered up with coin vigilante
[19:16] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[19:19] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[19:22] look at that beauty I love it so much

[21:21] out how you can level up your
[21:23] sovereignty that's super interesting the
[21:25] the thought of uh when there's a bigger
[21:28] government and their individual
[21:30] relationships are more unstable and
[21:34] smaller and they because people are
[21:37] already like okay like I I I have the
[21:41] police I have the I I pay for social
[21:43] insurance I pay for all the hospitals
[21:46] with my taxes so if someone falls down
[21:49] and and and I want to help them like
[21:50] yeah like let's call police like let
[21:52] them let let them deal with that kind of
[21:55] exactly so basically what you're doing
[21:57] when you're paying tax is that you
[21:59] Outsourcing like your personal
[22:00] responsibilities that should belong to
[22:02] you and when that happens of course that
[22:05] social social relationships on on in
[22:09] society will will not be as strong as as
[22:11] they would be you can you can say the
[22:13] same thing for instance about the family
[22:15] per se because what happens right now is
[22:17] that with with the the pension system
[22:20] that pretty much every every Western
[22:23] Government has um has Implement has
[22:26] implemented yeah right now what happens
[22:29] is that all right you get uh you GIC you
[22:32] basically get um a
[22:35] retirement um no yeah you get a wage for
[22:39] your retirement right it's guaranteed so
[22:43] actually I'm can't remember the exact
[22:45] word right now but uh you know when you
[22:47] retire you get you get a payment from
[22:49] the government right I like the pension
[22:52] yeah pension yeah thanks so what what
[22:55] happens is that actually what
[22:59] what would happen without the government
[23:00] is that you you you had to have kids
[23:03] right um because if you didn't during
[23:08] the last days of your life you wouldn't
[23:09] have um you wouldn't have anyone I mean
[23:13] you would have friends right but
[23:15] possibly you wouldn't have like someone
[23:17] that would be like close by that could
[23:20] help you in on a daily basis so that was
[23:23] one of the reasons why you had kids kids
[23:25] as well so but once the the government
[23:29] steps in is just saying all right never
[23:32] mind about that we'll just pay you a
[23:35] pension in the future regardless of of
[23:38] what happens um but of course that if
[23:41] this is the case you you're going to be
[23:44] less um you're going to be less
[23:48] motivated um to B to to have
[23:51] kids right
[23:54] because if you can get that help in the
[23:58] future future
[23:59] regardless of of of producing um in this
[24:03] case the the human capital that is
[24:06] resources that is that is necessary in
[24:09] order to to provide that help in the
[24:11] future people are just less incentivized
[24:14] to to to have kids and then in the end
[24:17] of the day uh fertility rate goes down
[24:21] and uh society as a whole um yeah it's
[24:27] it's I mean uh
[24:28] society as a whole collapses uh because
[24:31] without without any people right Society
[24:34] will of course go go down there there's
[24:38] there's no Society without people like
[24:40] that's and it's it's super
[24:43] interest also never thought about uh the
[24:47] governments helping elderly people gives
[24:50] an
[24:51] incentive for Less kids and we have seen
[24:55] this steady uh decline of fertility
[24:59] rates where people get less and less
[25:01] kids I mean we only have to look at like
[25:04] my grandma got six kids my mom got only
[25:07] two kids I currently have zero kids but
[25:10] I I intend to have a lot of kids uh but
[25:12] like that that that's a super
[25:14] interesting uh thought of like we we see
[25:17] that we get less and less kids but in
[25:20] fact we actually get need to have more
[25:22] kids uh to to keep that whole system
[25:25] like without that we get extinct at some
[25:28] point
[25:29] another thing that explains this
[25:30] phenomenon is of course the the whole
[25:33] time preference thing right I'm pretty
[25:34] sure that you're familiar with that
[25:36] concept so fat money yeah in a way so we
[25:40] we are already we already have a
[25:41] positive time preference right that's
[25:43] something that the kesian also don't
[25:45] understand right because if your time
[25:47] preference is positive assuming that
[25:49] you're a mortal being that you know that
[25:51] you're going to die
[25:53] the your your capability of of taking
[25:57] advantage of all the wealth that
[26:00] you that you that you accumulate as life
[26:04] goes by um diminish diminishes right as
[26:08] as you get closer to death so of course
[26:12] that you
[26:14] are well incentivized you are more than
[26:16] incentivized to consume today compared
[26:20] to tomorrow and of course that you you
[26:22] you can also throw in the fact that you
[26:25] cannot you you you don't have 100% %
[26:28] Assurance is that you're going to be
[26:29] here tomorrow so of course that everyone
[26:32] is going to prefer to consume today
[26:35] versus um tomorrow right so there's no
[26:38] need for for for money to get to get
[26:41] inflated away in order for people to
[26:43] want to consume right now right because
[26:44] that's that probably already heard that
[26:47] deflation fot um where people are like
[26:51] okay so if people stop consuming the the
[26:55] economy will basically collapse because
[26:57] aggregate demand will will just shrink
[26:59] and then uh basically companies will
[27:01] make less money and will make less money
[27:04] they will hire uh less people and if
[27:07] less people less people have a job uh
[27:11] consumption will will diminish again and
[27:13] then this you have this virtual cycle
[27:16] but what what happens is that you it's
[27:20] not what what is happening right now is
[27:23] the the consumption level the economy is
[27:25] like overextended beyond what would what
[27:28] would be what would happen in a in a
[27:30] natural free free economy and people
[27:32] just think that this overextended level
[27:35] is like the natural rate of consumption
[27:36] in the economy you know what I mean so
[27:39] the the the reference point is like
[27:41] biased
[27:42] towards um the right what what the the
[27:45] big issue with deflation it's not it's
[27:49] not consumption it's it's the fact that
[27:52] we have an over leverage an over
[27:55] leverage system of course and when when
[27:57] they economy is based on thatb of course
[28:00] that you need money to to lose value as
[28:04] as time goes by for it to be for it to
[28:07] be sustainable otherwise everything
[28:08] collapses so it has nothing to do with
[28:10] consumption so I don't know if I if I
[28:13] was clear it's kind of it's kind of hard
[28:14] to explain these all these thoughts and
[28:17] all these things in in in a foreign
[28:20] language yeah but yeah you're you're
[28:23] doing good I at least understand it very
[28:25] well I hope hope the viers also um that
[28:28] that's super interesting uh the the all
[28:31] the aspects of like bigger governments
[28:33] time preference uh then the fertility
[28:35] rate of of that uh the spending behavior
[28:39] and yeah like obviously like it's it's
[28:41] such I I I hear actually that argument
[28:45] from people of like oh but if the money
[28:47] is hard nobody spends I'm like of course
[28:50] people spend like like I have all I'm
[28:53] I'm all in Bitcoin I I I only do Bitcoin
[28:57] uh I I of course receive payments also
[29:00] in in Fiat but actually most of my
[29:02] income is already in Bitcoin uh I try to
[29:04] spend uh Bitcoin as much as I can uh I
[29:07] have to spend Bitcoin because most of my
[29:09] income is is in Bitcoin uh and and still
[29:13] I spend money like I I buy lights for my
[29:16] studio I buy food for my home I I travel
[29:21] I I I live live because like what what
[29:25] do I have from a lot of Bitcoin if I
[29:27] never use them and just die like
[29:29] obviously I can I can give them my kids
[29:31] and stuff like that but every person has
[29:33] a positive time preference uh but if we
[29:36] can lower it it makes quality of life
[29:39] actually better and not worse and this
[29:41] is a really hard concept for people to
[29:43] understand um of like okay you you spend
[29:46] less you you uh you value the future
[29:50] more but you have a better life now I I
[29:52] I truly believe uh that that's the case
[29:55] at least that's was what was the case
[29:57] for me uh uh once I started lowering my
[29:59] time preference and doing that it's a
[30:01] it's a foreign concept to a lot of
[30:03] Economist
[30:05] unfortunately yeah at the end of the day
[30:07] money is a tool right it's not the end
[30:08] goal and uh unfortunately what I think
[30:11] Fiat money does to to our brains as well
[30:14] is that it kind of like reinforces this
[30:17] idea that money is the end goal rather
[30:20] than than a tool because what what ends
[30:23] up happening I don't know if you're
[30:24] familiar with the concept of Fu money so
[30:29] money F your money Fu money a level of
[30:32] Fu money yeah didn't yeah absolutely so
[30:35] I would make I would make the argument
[30:36] that with Bitcoin is the only Fu money
[30:40] right and actually without Bitcoin you
[30:41] can never have Fu money because yeah you
[30:44] have a your money or I mean I'm
[30:45] saying have you money but we can swear
[30:47] in this podcast right um
[30:50] absolutely so the whole idea of of
[30:53]  money for those that are not
[30:55] familiar with with this concept is uh an
[30:58] amount of wealth so big that you can
[31:00] basically do whatever you want you can
[31:01] say what you want you can yeah total
[31:04] freedom that total absolute
[31:06] freedom but why do I make an argument
[31:09] that on a Fiat regime you can never have
[31:12] Fu money because an inflationary regime
[31:15] the cost of living keeps going up so
[31:19] even if you have let's say let's say
[31:21] that you are someone that started a
[31:24] company and you were like super
[31:25] successful you sold it for like 10
[31:27] million EUR or10 million now you have
[31:30] that money on your bank account on an
[31:32] inflationary regime you can never rest
[31:35] assur that that money is going to be
[31:37] enough for for your life or for for your
[31:40] kids why because you look around and for
[31:44] instance you go to I don't know Lisbon
[31:47] let's say the Portuguese capital or
[31:49] Berlin or Paris or any City what
[31:53] Whatever Whenever in the world wherever
[31:56] in the world sorry and what you see is
[31:58] that for instance house prices keep
[32:00] increasing 10% every year so you you
[32:03] canot you can never be uh 100% sure that
[32:09] the 10 million that that you have in
[32:11] your bank account is going to be enough
[32:13] in order to basically buy a house or to
[32:15] provide for your children let's say that
[32:17] your children you want to to give them
[32:19] you want to offer them a house when he
[32:21] or she turns 18 if you look around and
[32:24] everything is rising 10 by by 10% you're
[32:27] like is my 10 million are my 10 million
[32:30] going to be enough right is like Fiat
[32:33] the inflation like they what what it
[32:37] ises to your brain is like it keeps
[32:38] inserting this question into in your
[32:40] head you and you you never have like
[32:42] true peace of mind that uh true Fu money
[32:47] should uh would bring or should bring
[32:49] you know what I
[32:50] mean yeah it's kind of like the the the
[32:54] true strength of May maybe uh one
[32:57] example of even my life uh that that
[33:00] podcast would probably not existed if I
[33:04] haven't started saving a Bitcoin because
[33:06] I was in a feat job and uh I was like ah
[33:09] I don't know if if I want to do a
[33:11] Bitcoin podcast and I'm like all in or
[33:14] or nothing guy so I wouldn't had to do I
[33:16] wouldn't done the podcast just on a side
[33:19] project um but because I saw in the
[33:22] first one two months a little bit of a
[33:23] results I was like okay let's go all in
[33:26] this Bitcoin podcast I I was like I had
[33:29] 500 subscribers like I I had no success
[33:31] I had no money I had no sponsorship
[33:34] contracts I had no contacts in Bitcoin I
[33:36] just like let let's jump into it and I
[33:40] only took that decision out of Courage
[33:43] and the courage came uh mostly from
[33:47] having Bitcoin savings because I was
[33:49] like okay I I can live off Bitcoin for
[33:51] one two years maybe uh depending on how
[33:53] the price goes but uh I I I can live off
[33:56] my Bitcoin savings for a little while
[33:58] and I was prepared to live off my
[34:01] Bitcoin savings luckily and never had to
[34:02] do that I always had a a positive cash
[34:05] flow each month uh but because Bitcoin
[34:10] uh gave me that Financial Security and
[34:13] the savings of Bitcoin give me the
[34:14] Financial Security I could take a PRI a
[34:18] brave decision uh and and and follow
[34:21] more of my what I really wanted to do uh
[34:24] even though my my job before and that
[34:26] was the hurdle rate of like my job
[34:28] before I liked it it it was not a bad
[34:30] job but nobody was bad to me like it was
[34:33] a good environment good thing it was it
[34:34] security uh but I just wanted to have
[34:38] this basically a similar thing but in
[34:41] Bitcoin and because of the Bitcoin I I
[34:43] could actually do that and I think
[34:45] that's where it also comes in the
[34:47] decision making I think that's what a
[34:49] lot of bitcoiners feel as well is that
[34:51] once you you start positioning yourself
[34:54] on a Bitcoin standard you kind of like
[34:57] know that your your your financial
[35:01] future is is secure right and if your
[35:03] financial future is secure if your
[35:05] financial wealth per se is um you have
[35:09] it like guaranteed you know that you
[35:12] have more control over your time right
[35:15] um and in a sense that's that's what
[35:17] this is all about in the end of the day
[35:19] once again tool money is a tool is not
[35:22] goal so I think the the best thing that
[35:27] we coin can can give us um in the end of
[35:30] the days of course the the freedom to
[35:32] pursue our our dreams and uh everything
[35:36] that we want to do with with our lives
[35:39] um yeah I I would say that that's that's
[35:43] the case absolutely that's that's the
[35:45] most important thing of of Bitcoin um
[35:48] but the the thing that we from the
[35:50] starting actually wanted to talk about
[35:51] is uh how we can make Bitcoin more
[35:54] decentralized and what you're working on
[35:56] with with stratum uh I'm really looking
[35:58] forward to to what you I unfortunately
[36:00] didn't have time to to read the paper
[36:02] that you sent to me uh today but I'm
[36:05] really looking forward to like what
[36:07] you're working on there
[36:08] so basically like I said uh we have this
[36:12] issue in Bitcoin right now so blocklets
[36:14] are being created by the pools not by
[36:17] the miners of course that is goes
[36:19] completely against what Satoshi
[36:21] envisioned um back back in 2010 when he
[36:25] was talking um on on the forums so um
[36:30] once again the major one of the major
[36:32] value propositions of Bitcoin is being
[36:34] sensorship resistant and we cannot
[36:36] guarantee that uh if we have six or
[36:39] seven players deciding what goes in
[36:42] those those BLX um so the Innovation
[36:46] that stratum V2 brings so just just to
[36:50] to
[36:51] clarify uh for everyone that is not
[36:53] familiar with with these mining Concepts
[36:56] um there has
[36:58] been um several mining protocols several
[37:01] mining protocols were were used by by
[37:04] miners uh uh across bitcoin's history
[37:08] and uh the one that is uh being used
[37:11] right now or that is Mo mostly commonly
[37:14] used is stratom V2 strm V1 sorry and um
[37:18] on stratom
[37:20] V1 the the Str V1 protocol doesn't allow
[37:23] for for miners to to create the the
[37:27] blockchain templates and basically to to
[37:30] build the blocks and to to choose
[37:31] whatever transactions they want to to to
[37:34] put in them and uh Str
[37:37] mv2 um I think it started being
[37:40] developed back in 2021 by the brains gu
[37:43] together with Matt Corell a Bitcoin core
[37:45] developer and uh it solves a lot of
[37:47] issues but the main the the the main one
[37:51] is is is this issue with B input
[37:53] creation so basically with shm V2 miners
[37:55] have the option um
[37:58] uh running a node and uh
[38:01] basically uh on their own terms build
[38:03] build the blocks and select your
[38:05] transactions that they want to to to add
[38:08] to it uh that's something else that I
[38:10] actually didn't know uh and most people
[38:13] are not aware that most miners right now
[38:16] they don't run noes
[38:18] so they they just have a connection
[38:20] straight to the pool right and um once
[38:23] again that's why I was saying that in to
[38:25] this's configuration miners are like
[38:27] more like an employee of the pool rather
[38:29] than employee of the network as um which
[38:33] is probably something that most people
[38:36] are not are not aware of so um yeah
[38:40] stratom V2 fixes this issue um other
[38:43] isues that it fixes for instance uh
[38:47] empty blocks I don't know probably
[38:49] already seen right sometimes there's
[38:51] blocks that are m without transaction
[38:53] fees that's due to a a technicality that
[38:57] uh basically Str V2 works I I I think
[39:00] it's it's not appropriate to go into
[39:02] technical details right uh but uh but it
[39:06] fixes that uh sv2 is encrypted as well
[39:09] so it prevents any m in the middle
[39:11] attacks um uh a man build attack is
[39:14] basically uh someone hijacking your hash
[39:17] rate so uh they could like steal your
[39:19] shares like your work so the the the
[39:22] minor submits shares submits work to the
[39:25] pool and what what can happen on this
[39:29] strm V2 let's say framework right now is
[39:33] that someone can come in um and
[39:35] basically steal a portion of your share
[39:37] of your shares without being
[39:40] noticed um so yeah that's something that
[39:44] affects minor profitability um and
[39:46] that's something that strm V2 works as
[39:49] well um in terms of other features uh it
[39:54] consumes less CPU less pend wig so um
[39:57] miners uh end up with with less T shares
[40:03] um so yeah you know not shell overall I
[40:07] think I think this is it I don't know if
[40:09] yeah I I threw I I threw in like some um
[40:14] some mining line Concepts that probably
[40:16] are not um very well known amongst
[40:21] everyone in the Bitcoin Community I
[40:22] don't know if you want me to to dig a
[40:25] little bit deeper into into into them or
[40:30] yeah it's it's uh for me it's also
[40:32] interesting to know like where how deep
[40:35] on certain parts the the the knowledge
[40:38] of of of the fers are and I I always try
[40:41] to like make it really beginner friendly
[40:44] so like even if someone just comes
[40:46] around uh they they kind of can can
[40:48] consume it um but with with those mining
[40:50] topics it's it's hard because there are
[40:52] many Concept in there that are uh uh
[40:56] like not no like we talk a lot about
[40:59] where bitcoin's future is going the
[41:01] adoption like the economic size of it a
[41:04] economics we also talk a lot about uh
[41:06] but I think mining the technicalities of
[41:09] those um it just doesn't get as much
[41:12] attention I feel like and and that's why
[41:15] we have more knowledge gaps in the
[41:18] community around mining um the average
[41:21] Bitcoin I can way better describe why of
[41:24] an economic standpoint it needs a
[41:26] decentralized currency like Bitcoin that
[41:29] is Fu money uh but they cannot the the
[41:34] average Bitcoin I can not as good
[41:36] explain the mining process and What
[41:38] needs in mining and why we need more
[41:42] decentralized uh uh mining network uh
[41:45] why we need smaller miners why templates
[41:47] or like what even a template is I think
[41:50] that's something uh that that people
[41:52] don't know like ocean what ocean is
[41:54] doing and stuff like that that's all
[41:56] really interesting uh Concepts but we
[41:58] need to close those gaps of
[42:01] like I think I would say for for any
[42:03] beginner that is listening to this the
[42:06] most important thing that they need to
[42:07] know is that right now once again pools
[42:09] are the ones that build the blocks okay
[42:12] they and since they are the ones that
[42:14] build blocks they are the ones that
[42:15] choose the transactions that go in them
[42:17] and since there are only six or seven um
[42:20] major pools that represent the vast
[42:22] majority of hash rate this means that
[42:24] these six seven entities have right now
[42:26] the power to select what goes in the
[42:28] those blocks so censorship in a in a in
[42:30] a sense at least partially is possible
[42:33] right now in Bitcoin and what Strat and
[42:36] V2 uh brings to the table is that it
[42:39] transfers That Power from the pools to
[42:41] the miners therefore if the miners
[42:45] individually are the ones selecting
[42:47] transaction are the ones building blocks
[42:50] this sensorship trap this censorship
[42:52] threat sorry uh gets eliminated
[42:55] basically internet shell that this is
[42:57] like the most important thing that
[42:58] people need need to know and of course
[43:01] uh I would also add that since on in in
[43:05] Strat V2 miners will build their own
[43:09] blocks they of course need to run a node
[43:12] so and as I was saying right now the
[43:15] vast majority of miners I would say more
[43:17] than 90% for sure they don't run a not
[43:20] so they're not directly connected to the
[43:22] network so what Strat V2 is going to
[43:24] bring as well is that basically
[43:27] hopefully we're going to see a huge
[43:29] search in Bitcoin nodes all over the
[43:32] world uh which of course will will help
[43:36] enhance be uh the network
[43:37] decentralization in the end of the day
[43:40] absolutely really cool um is is another
[43:43] thing also the the miners itself that we
[43:47] get more individual miners versus uh in
[43:51] institutional miners that are just
[43:53] haveing huge farms that are I I I like
[43:57] how bobet calls them like the rabbits
[43:59] versus the horses versus the elephants I
[44:02] think he calls them I don't know if how
[44:04] big one the big ones are
[44:05] called yeah I think it's it's important
[44:08] although we've seen with the China band
[44:11] that U network is is able to withstand
[44:14] right um a huge drop being hash but
[44:17] let's say if let's say we're talking
[44:20] let's talk about like the the worst
[44:23] scenario of all so let say that 90% of
[44:26] the hash rate is on these these public
[44:29] miners what can happen is that if that's
[44:33] the case the government has access at
[44:36] least indirectly to that hash rate right
[44:38] so in theory they can like shut it off
[44:40] and uh if that was the case you would
[44:43] have like a 90% drop on the ash rate so
[44:46] then until the diff the difficulty
[44:49] adjustment kicks in it would take uh not
[44:52] two weeks it would take way much longer
[44:55] so um yeah a lot of chaos could could
[45:00] ensue if if such a scenario um happen
[45:03] and what can we do um to like prevent
[45:08] that or or at least to kind of like
[45:09] diminish the probability of such a
[45:11] scenario is of course to run as much as
[45:13] much ba axes and home miners as possible
[45:16] because it might not seem a lot right
[45:18] individually but if we get a million um
[45:22] for instance be axes or yeah 1 million
[45:25] theashes so it's a million Terah hases
[45:28] we're talking
[45:29] about uh one ex aash right
[45:33] so it might not not not seem a lot but
[45:37] it's if if everyone does this we it it
[45:43] might it might be important right for
[45:45] for such a scenario because let's say
[45:47] 800 uh ex aash is right now a 90% drop
[45:50] in the hash rate in the scenario that I
[45:52] was describing so one two% we're talking
[45:55] about at least like
[45:57] three four% of the hash rate uh on in
[46:01] home miners that of course not Su
[46:03] susceptible to this pressure from the US
[46:05] government to do whatever they want they
[46:08] want them to do so yeah it's definitely
[46:12] it's definitely important um to keep
[46:14] that in mind as
[46:16] well yeah it's the I would just sorry I
[46:19] would just add that of course that what
[46:22] we what we end up relying on at the end
[46:25] of the day is of course the incentive
[46:26] structure
[46:27] because what kind of like gives me um a
[46:31] pece of mind that the scenario will not
[46:33] play out is that governments they are of
[46:36] course motivated to to contribute to the
[46:40] network and to actually to contribute
[46:42] with hash power and to mine as much as
[46:44] possible so it's the game theory right
[46:47] aspect of it so in a sense Bitcoin is
[46:49] based on on math right and math energy
[46:52] proof of work physics and then you have
[46:54] the incentive structure that makes sure
[46:56] that everyone um keeps using their
[46:59] energy their effort to contribute to the
[47:01] network rather than attacking it uh and
[47:04] and at the end of the day that's what
[47:06] gives me the the the Assurance at least
[47:10] in theory that such a scenario like that
[47:13] won't happen even let's say even in in
[47:15] the case that there's like a a huge
[47:18] amount of of of asash rate on on public
[47:21] miners on public miners hands that's
[47:23] that's that's super interesting of like
[47:25] the the game feel
[47:27] of we need many many smaller ones
[47:31] because they are not as easy to to to
[47:33] kill um they're easy to kill but like
[47:37] you cannot kill them all like because
[47:38] there's so many and like you need the
[47:42] the mix of that and and I think the best
[47:45] defense of the of the Bitcoin net Market
[47:47] itself is that every time that someone
[47:49] eventually thinks about attacking
[47:50] Bitcoin they are never 100% I mean they
[47:54] are not 100 100% sure of course but they
[47:57] can never be assur that they will
[47:58] succeed and they know that if they don't
[48:00] succeed Bitcoin in that process will
[48:02] become will become stronger right is the
[48:04] anti fragility process that that Nim Tob
[48:07] talks about so that's that's like the
[48:09] the big issue for anyone that wants to
[48:11] to do harm to bitcoin as well because
[48:13] the time goes by its resilience it it it
[48:16] increases right it has been increasing
[48:18] as for for these past few years right
[48:21] has rate has gone through the roof and
[48:23] uh it gets more and more difficult to do
[48:26] any kind of attack on bitcoin and beyond
[48:29] that or moreover you you need to take
[48:31] into account as well the fact that if
[48:33] you fail to do that Bitcoin will become
[48:36] even stronger
[48:38] because it just got proven that Bitcoin
[48:41] is able to resist to to attack like like
[48:44] yours interesting do you think that
[48:46] Bitcoin at that point is is over the
[48:49] point of no return is over the point of
[48:51] inavailability like it it's like almost
[48:55] impossible to kind of get get it back in
[48:58] in in in get get it destroyed I think
[49:01] there's a lot of things that we have to
[49:03] be concerned about this issue with uh
[49:06] pools creating block inputs is one of
[49:09] them uh a lot of hash rate on public
[49:12] minor hands is is another one for sure
[49:15] however if you like once again if you
[49:18] take into account uh the incentives of
[49:20] all the participants uh in let's say the
[49:23] economic game we we kind of know that
[49:27] Bitcoin has reached a a strength level
[49:30] that basically not even a government can
[49:33] can bring it down so um because we we're
[49:37] talking about like the we're not in the
[49:39] physical space right we're we're in the
[49:41] cyber space and in in the physical space
[49:43] even if you have the biggest army in the
[49:45] world you cannot do that you cannot do
[49:47] anything about it um that's that's
[49:50] that's the magic of Bitcoin right yeah
[49:53] and it it it makes me think about the
[49:55] implications of that like if we have uh
[49:58] the the biggest force of Bitcoin and it
[50:02] kind of goes into that and it kind of
[50:04] forces itself onto all of the other
[50:07] things because game theory is so strong
[50:08] and the network effect is so strong what
[50:11] kind of implications do you see coming
[50:14] in a world that was there 20 years ago
[50:18] world is is kind of now there and
[50:19] especially if bitco becomes more more
[50:21] mainstream and more more adopted what do
[50:23] you think is the implications of that I
[50:26] think what's going to play out is uh the
[50:29] sovereign individual thesis I don't know
[50:30] if you read that book already but uh
[50:33] once again since both central banks and
[50:36] governments are are incentivized to to
[50:38] survive right um they will they will
[50:42] eventually by by Bitcoin right they will
[50:45] bend the knee of course and they'll say
[50:47] all right you manage to to take the
[50:51] power of of money out of our hands but
[50:54] we want to to to remain
[50:57] at least with uh as the mo the most
[51:00] amount of power possible and uh there
[51:04] there will come a day where they will
[51:06] say all right I'll just buy Bitcoin in
[51:08] order to achieve that goal that I that
[51:10] that I
[51:11] have um so I think we will live in a
[51:15] world with smaller States you will have
[51:17] a lot of city states for instance um
[51:20] those regions that have been fighting
[51:22] for Independence such as Catalonia um I
[51:27] actually I don't know uh is is that the
[51:30] the correct term in in English yeah
[51:32] Catal no I think I I at least know what
[51:35] you know
[51:36] but maybe basically um but yeah you have
[51:41] also that area on the north of Belgium
[51:44] uh I forgot its name so all those
[51:47] regions I think eventually in the next
[51:49] like 30 to 40 years will manage to to
[51:51] gain their their
[51:53] independence and uh there will be more
[51:55] competition between um between
[51:58] governments between states and uh people
[52:01] will start looking at them more like
[52:03] service providers rather than this the
[52:06] Behemoth that everyone needs just to to
[52:09] comply and do whatever they want I I I
[52:12] do think so I hope so what what do you
[52:14] think is will the EU then necessarily
[52:17] fail like as a as a con a
[52:21] concept I think so it's inevitable it's
[52:24] kind of sad in one end because
[52:27] it was European Union that brought peace
[52:29] right to to to our continent um it's
[52:32] kind of it's kind of painful to see it
[52:34] go go away but we know that the way
[52:36] things are structured right now it's are
[52:39] it's basically unsustainable we have
[52:42] very different uh people very different
[52:44] cultures different views of doing things
[52:47] and uh although of course we are
[52:49] Europeans we are brothers but uh yeah uh
[52:54] that doesn't mean of course that uh we
[52:56] need to have like this big Union with
[52:59] all this bureaucracy and then everyone
[53:01] is doing like the same thing and I think
[53:03] it's inevitable that in in the next the
[53:07] next few decades um European Union will
[53:10] just disintegrate itself I love how elen
[53:14] said it recently we don't live in a
[53:15] democracy we live in a
[53:18] bureaucracy yeah unfortunately it is
[53:22] what it is how do you how do you look at
[53:24] uh things like Doge obviously not the
[53:25] coin the the government program of like
[53:28] cutting government spending and bringing
[53:30] maybe even like a little bit more
[53:32] liberal Force into that I think it's
[53:35] great for me I'm a ha guy I've once
[53:40] again I'm I'm reading Mur roart and uh
[53:44] whatever
[53:45] actions put more monies in people's
[53:48] pockets the the better at the end of the
[53:50] say um because the smaller the
[53:53] government the smaller the PO that
[53:55] everyone is just incentivized to to try
[53:57] to get their hands on right so it's it's
[54:00] a it's a it's a fairer it's a fairer
[54:03] system in the end of the day with with
[54:05] less taxes because what the government
[54:07] does in today's world is just playing
[54:09] this role of God right because you had
[54:12] like some voluntary interactions between
[54:14] all members in society someone provided
[54:17] value uh they got this this wealth as a
[54:21] reward for it right and then the
[54:23] government is saying no because in my
[54:25] view in my in a view that of course is
[54:27] subjective no you don't deserve that
[54:29] amount of wealth someone else deserves
[54:31] it because I don't know they they did
[54:35] they they were not burn in in in a
[54:38] certain condition but of course that
[54:39] that's a subjective that's a subjective
[54:41] opinion right it's nothing objective so
[54:45] you you you cannot you cannot put things
[54:47] like that right and of course what what
[54:50] what end up happening in in such a in
[54:52] such a society is that people in the end
[54:56] of they become less incentivized in
[54:59] order to produce wealth in order to to
[55:01] to provide value to others and they
[55:03] become more incentivized to just come as
[55:05] close as possible to to the government
[55:08] to get that money that that the
[55:10] government collects from the private
[55:11] sector and from the wealth creators but
[55:14] if that happens of course wealth stops
[55:17] being produced and then in the end of
[55:18] the day is everyone ends up in property
[55:22] right and that's a that's a socialist
[55:25] dream of everyone is going to be uh poor
[55:30] that's I think I don't think they they
[55:32] think right they think that uh at the
[55:34] end of the day regardless of your
[55:36] economic views or your political views
[55:38] uh you just want everyone to to live a
[55:41] good life at least that's that's that's
[55:44] what I I I believe uh the issue is that
[55:48] of course there's a in terms of
[55:50] Education there's a there's a huge huge
[55:54] gap um for in the in the vast majority
[55:59] of the of the population in in in
[56:00] today's world and people cannot think
[56:03] critically about things and of course
[56:05] that when you have an educated
[56:09] population um you as a government you
[56:12] you can do whatever whatever you want
[56:15] and uh I actually I would argue that
[56:18] besides of course that the power over
[56:21] money is the most important power that
[56:23] that you can have on a society but after
[56:25] that definitely the the monopo on
[56:28] education is is definitely the the the
[56:32] second most important one for sure
[56:35] because if you if you manage to to get
[56:38] people thinking that all right this is
[56:42] the way to go and this is the the thing
[56:45] that we need to do and it cannot be the
[56:48] other way around and there's no other
[56:50] way to do it and it's uh then it it gets
[56:54] it gets very very trick freaky
[56:58] um yeah absolutely we we talked about a
[57:01] lot of topics today actually but uh I
[57:03] have one question that asked each and
[57:05] every one of my guests and the question
[57:06] is what can we learn from you besides
[57:09] Bitcoin what can oh that's a good
[57:11] question I
[57:13] wasn't expecting but uh I mean I I would
[57:16] say that uh in a more philosophical lens
[57:21] just um yeah remember that uh in the end
[57:25] of the day uh there there's a famous
[57:27] quote by confusius that says you only
[57:29] have you have two lives the second one
[57:31] starts when you when you understand you
[57:33] only have one
[57:36] so of course that Bitcoin is fine yet
[57:38] but the end of the day your time is
[57:40] really the the most uh precious asset
[57:43] that you have so just don't waste it on
[57:46] stupid things just be sure that um you
[57:50] take advantage of like every moment in
[57:51] your life and don't take um today to
[57:56] today for granted or or tomorrow or
[57:58] whatever just of course that you need
[58:00] some balance you cannot leave like uh
[58:02] today easier less day in the world right
[58:04] because that was the case probably you
[58:07] would you would sell all all your
[58:08] Bitcoin and you you would you would take
[58:12] advantage of it on on on on these last
[58:16] on your last 24 hours but just try to
[58:19] have that presence like the fact that we
[58:20] are mortal beings that that um life life
[58:24] goes fast and and enjoy it as much as
[58:27] you can and uh have that in mind um
[58:31] always absolutely yeah that's that's
[58:33] that's very true I love the quote of
[58:35] like uh you you have two lives and the
[58:37] second one starts once you realize you
[58:40] only have one that that's that's a
[58:42] that's a heck of heard I never heard
[58:45] that actually it's a really good one I
[58:47] like it really cool perfect then uh we
[58:49] have an tin in the podcast where the
[58:51] previous guest is asking a question for
[58:52] the next guest without knowing who the
[58:54] next guest actually is and and your
[58:56] question from the previous guest is what
[58:59] year will the hyper pitalization
[59:03] be that's a tough question so I I would
[59:07] put my money on uh probably in like 30
[59:11] years so 20 20 55 something like
[59:17] that yeah
[59:19] 2025 2025 20 2055 yeah so 30 years
[59:24] 2055 nice very conservative now my
[59:27] question
[59:29] right uh really cool uh yeah like the
[59:31] the question uh you can think a little
[59:33] bit more about because I usually just
[59:35] put it offline uh but if you have
[59:37] already won you can uh scream it out but
[59:40] you you have more time to think about
[59:42] the question for the next guest um yeah
[59:44] thank you so much Francisco for for
[59:46] being on the show it was it was really
[59:47] great to have you um Before I Let You Go
[59:50] um where can people find you ask your
[59:52] questions and reach out to you yeah the
[59:54] easiest way to reach out for me is is
[59:56] through my Twitter I can send send my
[59:58] link I'm at shiku
[60:01] D21 and uh feel free to to DM me if you
[60:05] have any any questions about like these
[60:07] Strat and V2 things like uh what's going
[60:10] on on mining or anything else for that
[60:12] matter actually just um yeah feel free
[60:15] to to shoot me a message really cool
[60:17] thank you so much franisco for being on
[60:19] also thank you so far much thank you
