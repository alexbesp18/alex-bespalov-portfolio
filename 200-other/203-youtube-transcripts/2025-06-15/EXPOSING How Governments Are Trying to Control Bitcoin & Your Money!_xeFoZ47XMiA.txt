[00:00] I self custody, you self-custody. We go
[00:03] through our own proof of work to ensure
[00:06] that we are strengthening the network.
[00:08] And who's going to be responsible for
[00:10] that in government? Uh I'm a class of
[00:12] 2020 just like Michael Sailor. Is
[00:15] Bitcoin money? Yes, because I've used it
[00:17] as money and I interact with people who
[00:19] see it as money. So it may not be the
[00:22] global reserve currency, may not be on
[00:24] that standard. I'm against uh printing
[00:26] fiat to buy Bitcoin. That's just a
[00:28] ridiculous notion to me. As a boomer and
[00:30] as somebody who's lived a pretty long
[00:32] time and had a lot of experience around
[00:34] the world, I guess the message that I
[00:36] bring is don't rely on the government
[00:39] for any of it because they're going to
[00:41] manipulate whatever they do with Bitcoin
[00:43] and they're going to make it difficult.
[00:45] The first time I saw the memp pool and
[00:47] the first time I saw the structure of
[00:49] the time chain, it blew my mind because
[00:52] I done all this reading. I understand
[00:53] the philosophy. I understand the
[00:55] economics, the finances behind it. But
[00:57] until I actually saw that, that's why I
[00:59] was like, "Ah, that's it."
[01:03] [Music]
[01:05] Before we get started, maybe you can
[01:07] quickly uh tell us who you are and and
[01:10] why you're into Bitcoin.
[01:12] Yeah, my name is uh Darren Epstein and I
[01:15] go by my public persona is uh on X as
[01:20] the American Exile. Um, and I got into
[01:24] Bitcoin
[01:25] because uh I'm a class of 2020 just like
[01:29] Michael Sailor and uh it was around that
[01:33] I had been of course there's all I have
[01:35] a lot in common with guys like Larry
[01:38] Leard and um some others in the space
[01:42] who are older guys like me. I'm 60 and I
[01:45] had invested fairly successfully all my
[01:48] life in the stock market and then when
[01:51] we saw I'm in Japan and when we started
[01:55] to see the
[01:57] first inclination that the COVID
[02:01] pandemic was going to take place and
[02:04] that was around January here because
[02:06] there was the Diamond Princess ship in
[02:08] uh
[02:09] Tokyo where the first cases really
[02:11] started to publicly develop. M and then
[02:15] some friends and I at the office were I
[02:19] have I have one other friend who's a
[02:20] libertarian and is a gold bug. I was a
[02:23] gold bug as well but we were mainly in
[02:24] the stock market. We were looking at how
[02:26] can we I didn't know at the time that I
[02:29] was looking to reduce my time
[02:31] preference. Um but we had invested
[02:34] successfully in the stock market and we
[02:36] had done pretty well. We're both in the
[02:38] Department of Defense and we'll get into
[02:40] that later as to how that um I'm not too
[02:43] excited to admit that, but that's how I
[02:45] made my money. Uh and we invested mainly
[02:49] in stocks. Around that time, uh we
[02:52] anticipated that there was going to be a
[02:54] drop off in the market. So, I went and I
[02:57] switched into gold. And around 2019,
[02:59] maybe the later half of 2019, I had
[03:03] already read the Bitcoin Standard
[03:05] because a friend of mine was a
[03:06] libertarian and he was familiar with
[03:09] Hans Herman Hoa and Livic Van Mises and
[03:11] Rothbart.
[03:13] So after I read the Bitcoin standard and
[03:15] I was already going down the road to
[03:17] putting my resources in a sounder money,
[03:22] uh, Bitcoin instantly made sense to me
[03:26] because I was already dealing when we
[03:29] look at what the stock market is and I
[03:31] know you talk about this with a lot of
[03:32] guests. We're already dealing with a
[03:34] digital currency. I don't get paid
[03:37] in shekels. No one comes up to my house
[03:40] and brings me stacks of paper. I get
[03:42] digits in my uh inbox, you know, in my
[03:47] bank every month. And when you think
[03:50] about how those digits get created, and
[03:52] I know you've talked about it ad
[03:53] nauseium, that there's no proof of work,
[03:56] it's just somebody sitting on a
[03:57] keyboard. I was intrigued by this notion
[04:00] that there is a system. There's a
[04:02] protocol that accounts for uh a a a
[04:07] custody chain throughout its inception
[04:11] to its delivery to you. And and I knew
[04:14] nothing about how exchanges worked or
[04:17] how wallets work, but I learned and I
[04:18] went through the first steps of I did
[04:20] Coinbase and I think I had a treasure at
[04:22] the beginning. Um, but I put a little
[04:25] bit into Bitcoin and at the time, uh, a
[04:30] little bit of ETH because that was the
[04:32] whole everybody was talking about
[04:34] blockchain, right? You know it well.
[04:37] And, um, but and and again, I'm 60 now.
[04:41] I was, you know, 54, 56 at the time. Um,
[04:45] it instantly appealed to me because it
[04:48] just made sense in because nothing else
[04:51] made sense. and gold makes sense to me,
[04:55] but there's I'm sure you've talked about
[04:57] adnauseiums. There's all the problems
[05:00] associated with gold. So, after getting
[05:02] into gold for a while, I took everything
[05:06] out and then mainly got back into
[05:09] Bitcoin after I sold out of the market
[05:11] in March of 2020.
[05:15] Interesting. And um I mean, we can get
[05:18] in into everything, but first, when did
[05:21] you leave the USA? Was this already?
[05:23] Were you still in in America when when
[05:25] this happened? Oh, no, no, no. My We
[05:28] have to talk about my life a little bit.
[05:30] So, I I I've been um I enlisted in the
[05:34] US Army in 1988 and I've basically been
[05:38] out of the States since then for the
[05:40] most part. So, I spent uh three years in
[05:44] Europe uh in Germany. Um went to the
[05:47] first Gulf War. I spent uh five years in
[05:50] Korea, almost 20 years in Japan. So I've
[05:54] been uh outside the United States for
[05:57] the majority of the last 36 years.
[06:00] Interesting. So but in in from the US
[06:05] military. So you were sent here or on
[06:09] your own? Yeah. So I was in the US
[06:12] military from 1988 to 2010 and I was in
[06:16] Korea at the time and I retired. I
[06:18] entered so I dropped out of uh I was
[06:20] going to university and uh and and we
[06:23] can talk about you know how people get
[06:25] on their own journeys like you were
[06:27] mentioning before you know uh how old
[06:29] are you Robin? Do you mind me asking? Uh
[06:31] just 26. 26. Okay. So um as a
[06:35] 60-year-old I can't even remember what
[06:37] happened when I was so when I was 26 I
[06:39] was I would have been a lieutenant in
[06:43] the army in Germany. I probably would
[06:44] have been a first lieutenant. It would
[06:46] have been after I was in the first golf
[06:47] war I think when I was 24 or 25. And so
[06:51] uh the army was my life from 1988 to
[06:55] 2010. Um my wife's Japanese. We met in
[06:58] Japan around 2000 around 1999 and then
[07:02] we got married and and we've had kids.
[07:04] Uh we were stationed in Korea together.
[07:06] I decided to get out of the army from
[07:08] Korea and then I took a a a defense
[07:10] department of defense civilian job in
[07:13] Japan from 2010 till uh last year when I
[07:18] was kicked out. And you said you said
[07:20] previously you were in the defense
[07:23] department and you weren't proud of it.
[07:25] Why? Why that? Well, no. It it's just
[07:27] that
[07:29] uh you know and then this is we may have
[07:32] some you know um uncomfortable
[07:34] discussions today about uh where uh we
[07:39] are in the in the Bitcoin journey. I
[07:42] think a lot of times I I' I've been on a
[07:44] few co uh podcasts and and like you, you
[07:47] know, Robin, I I think most I I have
[07:52] problems with terms like the Bitcoin
[07:53] community
[07:55] because we are desperate people with
[07:58] different backgrounds of different races
[08:00] and different belief systems and there's
[08:02] uh uh uh and and and all those people
[08:04] got into this money, right? And of
[08:08] course we could approach it a ton of
[08:10] different ways and people could disagree
[08:11] with me. You know, I I just look at it
[08:13] and I had listened to a excellent
[08:15] podcast the other day on radio Rothbar
[08:17] between Ryan McMakin and Pier Band who
[08:20] wrote an excellent book called How to
[08:22] Think About the Economy and their their
[08:25] discussion was is gold and Bitcoin money
[08:28] and so because I'm older and I don't
[08:31] need any
[08:33] uh kind of
[08:35] philosophical uh accutrants to the thing
[08:39] that I think is going to have a certain
[08:42] use, right? I I don't have to me Bitcoin
[08:45] doesn't have to be energy or I know it's
[08:48] a protocol, but but I I'm 60. I have
[08:51] like what 20 years left on the planet.
[08:53] So whether it's an artist may look at it
[08:56] or a musician may look at it a different
[08:58] way based on their background. An
[09:00] engineer may look at it. Michael Sailor
[09:02] looks at it differently because of his
[09:03] background because he went to MIT. So he
[09:05] can describe it as energy and I'm not
[09:07] going to refute that. It can be all
[09:08] these things. Uh to me it's money. And
[09:13] um and when you're young or when you're
[09:16] older, as we go through life, we all
[09:19] have to figure out how we're going to
[09:21] make money, right? How we're going to
[09:24] gather the resources to live the type of
[09:26] life that we want to live. And so for
[09:30] me, when I was I'll start at 26, but I
[09:34] think I entered the army at
[09:35] 24. Um, I had left university uh because
[09:39] I didn't really know what I wanted to
[09:40] do. Uh, I had no real positive outlook.
[09:44] And then I decided for some reason that
[09:48] I would just enlist in the army cuz
[09:50] that's just something that Americans do.
[09:52] And my friends thought I was crazy
[09:54] because I was going to university and I
[09:55] was studying English and political
[09:57] science and and you know, good
[09:59] university students, right? like you
[10:01] have you may have your system like in
[10:03] Germany, you know, people go to
[10:04] gimnazium and people go to you go on the
[10:06] university
[10:07] track. Um probably the expectation is
[10:10] that I was going to be either a lawyer
[10:11] or a college professor or something like
[10:13] that. Um but I decided I just wanted
[10:16] some adventure. Uh, and so I enlisted in
[10:19] the army and I decided to go uh infantry
[10:23] and just do basic soldier stuff and go
[10:27] to airborne school and do all the things
[10:29] that uh to me at the time were not
[10:31] really associated with what my lifestyle
[10:33] was like. I wanted
[10:35] adventure. Um, and I never thought I
[10:37] would stay in to make it a career. I I
[10:39] had dropped out of I entered the army as
[10:41] a private a private first class because
[10:44] I had college. But then uh I applied
[10:46] myself and did well. I was a good
[10:49] soldier. I liked soldiering and um and
[10:53] then was able to go to university, was
[10:54] able to go to grad school, was able to
[10:56] to live all over the world, was able to
[10:58] save money. Um and I think around the
[11:01] time that I was yeah, when I was a young
[11:03] lieutenant, uh captain taught me about
[11:06] investing. So I invested in the stock
[11:08] market early on and I invested almost
[11:10] all of my disposable income into the
[11:14] market. And I did that since
[11:16] 1995. Um, the reason why I say that I'm
[11:18] not really proud of it was you don't
[11:21] really know that you're a tool of the
[11:23] empire when you're if you look at it
[11:25] that way, right? You don't know where
[11:26] you fit in historically into what your
[11:30] belief system will become.
[11:32] So, you know, being a soldier um in, you
[11:37] know, so I started to just have a bunch
[11:39] of questions that that led to me having
[11:41] my moniker on X, which is the American
[11:43] exile. I really don't feel like I fit in
[11:46] anywhere, fit into any country, fit into
[11:48] any system. I've lived so much overseas
[11:51] that somebody once said, I think it was
[11:53] Colonel Doug McGregor said that a senior
[11:55] NATO commander said to him that the
[11:58] United States isn't a country, it's a
[12:00] planet.
[12:01] And it's like it's it's just this
[12:03] separate entity from Europe when you
[12:06] look at how the United States thinks
[12:07] about things and thinks about the world.
[12:10] And when we look at especially from the
[12:11] perspective of uh of Bitcoin when most
[12:15] people arrive at this place where and I
[12:18] did it well before that philosophically
[12:20] I had these misgivings much pri prior to
[12:22] finding Bitcoin. That's that's why
[12:24] Bitcoin made sense. It didn't take a
[12:26] thousand hours. It didn't take a hundred
[12:28] hours. It took reading the Bitcoin
[12:30] standard. It took reading the bullish
[12:32] case for Bitcoin. Um, and then of
[12:34] course, you know, you just start going
[12:35] down the rabbit hole and you read
[12:37] everything. Um, but it instantly
[12:40] appealed to my sense that
[12:43] uh when a nation state controls money,
[12:47] it controls resources, it controls
[12:49] everything. It controls freedom. It
[12:51] controls speech. It controls and in our
[12:54] case in the United States, it controls
[12:56] the empire. And the empire isn't good.
[13:00] It's not a force for good. Um, and so
[13:03] the fact that we have 800 bases
[13:05] overseas, that's, you know, you heard
[13:06] the American national anthem, 5:00 every
[13:09] day. The bass is 2 miles away. They
[13:12] blare it loud so that every person,
[13:15] every Japanese per maybe 20,000 Japanese
[13:17] people in the surrounding area get to
[13:20] listen to the US national anthem at 5:00
[13:23] every day whether they like it or not.
[13:26] Um, and I don't think that's a good look
[13:29] uh for the United States. And that's way
[13:31] that's prior to Trump. And so Americans
[13:34] have, the way I see it, because I've
[13:36] been out of the country for so long, um,
[13:39] not all Americans, but many Americans
[13:41] have this sense that it's very Trumpian
[13:45] that we can do whatever we want to do,
[13:46] that we're we're great. Uh, we're going
[13:49] to have these bases whether you like it
[13:51] or not. We're going to project force
[13:53] from those bases whether you like it or
[13:54] not. We're going to bomb people whether
[13:57] you like it or not. Um, and for most uh,
[14:02] you know, nice uh, people who don't want
[14:06] the normal person that doesn't want to
[14:08] make any waves, it's not even put on the
[14:10] news. And that's what we do uh, with our
[14:13] empire. And we and we've been doing it
[14:15] for, you know, way before uh, 1945, you
[14:19] could say 1898 after the SpanishAmerican
[14:23] War. The United States continually
[14:25] expanded. And I was having this
[14:27] discussion with my son. We homeschool.
[14:30] Uh they're orange pe you that's the and
[14:32] that's another we can get to that
[14:34] discussion about you know h what's the
[14:37] future look like and what are the things
[14:38] that we can do in the future to to mold
[14:40] the future. But the reason why I'm not
[14:43] uh uh look I had a great time in the
[14:46] army and I don't I wouldn't change a
[14:48] thing because it made me who I who I am.
[14:51] But uh when we look at what our empire
[14:55] has become, it's not a force for good in
[14:57] the world. And I have misgivings about
[15:00] having been associated with it. Does
[15:02] that answer that question in a way?
[15:05] 100%. And I'm just curious. You you said
[15:09] the
[15:10] empire. Do you mean the US government or
[15:12] like the whole construct? Like what what
[15:14] do you mean by that? Well, the United
[15:16] States is an empire, right? So, however,
[15:20] however you want to construct it and and
[15:23] it's beyond the scope of the of the
[15:26] podcast. I don't want to give a history
[15:27] lesson but um and my my son and I were
[15:30] discussing this um and and so if we just
[15:33] do a really brief you know quick uh
[15:35] timeline from the beginning of the
[15:38] United States um and then this is a
[15:40] question that I had that we can pose at
[15:43] the end of our discussion is like right
[15:46] now in the Bitcoin community do we
[15:48] anticipate that we're going to go
[15:50] through an evolutionary change to a
[15:52] Bitcoin standard or will there be
[15:53] revolutions right there'll be some sort
[15:55] of spark arc that requires um inter
[15:59] inter unfavorable uh kinetic
[16:02] interactions, war revolution to convert
[16:05] to a bitcoin standard in 1860 1763
[16:09] rather if you had asked the average
[16:11] American who was British right there
[16:13] were British colonists the uh French and
[16:16] Indian war 7 years war had just ended if
[16:19] you had asked the average colonist what
[16:21] they thought about the British Empire
[16:23] they they they would have looked at you
[16:25] like you were foolish English. They were
[16:26] just colonists and they were in the
[16:28] colony colonies. Um, and they had
[16:31] participated largely in militias in the
[16:34] French and Indian war. After the end of
[16:36] that war, the British Empire was looking
[16:39] to uh recoup on the financial losses
[16:43] that it undertook fighting France for
[16:45] seven years in Europe. All it was a
[16:47] global conflict, but in Europe and in in
[16:50] the Americas.
[16:52] So that's where we get that whole
[16:53] timeline of the, you know, the stamp tax
[16:56] and and um the the coercive acts and all
[17:00] of those things that led up to what we
[17:02] call the American Revolution. Lexington
[17:04] conquered that battle uh in uh 1775
[17:08] occurred uh 250 years and two days ago.
[17:13] Um, and so we can learn a lot from that
[17:16] experience when when the colonies were
[17:18] going through a transition where they
[17:21] would then break away from Great Britain
[17:23] and become a republic. Right? So we went
[17:25] through this whole republican democracy.
[17:28] We don't really have to talk about the
[17:29] the evolution from the Articles of
[17:31] Confederation to the to the
[17:32] Constitution. But then very rapidly from
[17:35] that moment on, the United States
[17:37] started its expansion. So he went from
[17:40] 13 colonies then we went moved west and
[17:44] took whatever land we wanted from
[17:46] whoever was there and couldn't fight the
[17:48] fight. Michael Sailor talks in great
[17:50] deal about this and you can look at it
[17:53] uh scientifically germs, guns and steel
[17:56] uh that the superior
[17:58] um technology allowed the settlers to
[18:02] move west and displace the natives. But
[18:06] it's the same thing that we do today all
[18:08] around the globe and it doesn't make it
[18:10] morally or ethically defensible. So, but
[18:13] this idea that you know, so the United
[18:16] States is not this uh altruistic
[18:20] um you know uh unique uh republic that
[18:25] seeks to do good around the world. we we
[18:28] never have been and from our outset and
[18:30] it's only if you read you know Mario
[18:32] Rothbart's conceived in liberty
[18:34] something again that sailor recommends
[18:36] or um Patrick Newman's uh cronyism and I
[18:41] think the first one was from the uh
[18:43] right from the beginning of the colonial
[18:45] settlement this you know the early 1600s
[18:48] through maybe the mid700s I think he's
[18:51] written a part two um but this whole
[18:54] idea of the oligarchs of the time the
[18:56] landed
[18:57] gentry uh taking over the land as they
[19:01] moved west. And then 1803, we buy the
[19:04] Louisiana purchase. We keep moving west,
[19:06] take whatever land we want, we
[19:08] eventually buy Alaska from Russia. Um
[19:11] that's why what I marked in 1898, United
[19:14] States fights the SpanishAmerican War.
[19:16] We get the Philippines, Guam, Puerto
[19:18] Rico,
[19:20] uh you know, later on we take, you know,
[19:22] Hawaii for good measure. And so this the
[19:25] United States has been on this
[19:27] progression of moving
[19:30] outward, excuse me. Um so when the
[19:35] current narrative is that the US saved
[19:38] Europe in two world wars, nothing could
[19:40] be further from the truth, right? The
[19:43] the the European powers and and you
[19:45] know, are you're in you're in Vienna? Uh
[19:48] yes, I'm in Vienna. So I mean we could
[19:51] talk about that for forever. just the
[19:53] history um you know Austrohungarian
[19:56] Empire, the the Ottomans laying siege,
[19:59] you know, to Vienna. Um Napoleon
[20:02] conquered Vienna, the Russians, Sourov
[20:06] um on their way to Paris. Uh so these
[20:09] you know these historical epics and all
[20:12] of those especially Great Britain and
[20:14] France had their global empires and they
[20:16] maintained the those global empires
[20:19] through the Second World War. Right? the
[20:21] Netherlands were occupied, right?
[20:23] Austria went through the onloo and
[20:26] um and all of the European powers
[20:30] um had extensive
[20:33] empires and the United States was going
[20:35] to liberate Europe so that the Europeans
[20:37] could go back and take over their
[20:39] empires again. And in the United States
[20:42] is the same. You know, why why does the
[20:43] United States fight Japan? It's really
[20:46] because we're in their neighborhood.
[20:47] we're in the Philippines and we're
[20:49] competing over resources. Um, so this
[20:53] idea that
[20:55] uh and Patrick Buchanan wrote a great
[20:57] book called a republic not an empire,
[20:59] controversial figure in American
[21:01] politics. Um, but it's um really pre
[21:05] proposes the theory that you can either
[21:07] be a republic or you can be an empire.
[21:10] And right now we are an empire because
[21:12] we have, you know, we're on the um the
[21:15] dollar is the global reserve currency.
[21:17] We have 800 bases around the world. Um
[21:21] you see how we dictate trade policy. Uh
[21:24] and it's not, you know,
[21:26] by quiet negot I'm sorry, quiet
[21:30] negotiation. It's through coercion based
[21:33] on this
[21:34] idea that you can use force if you have
[21:37] to because we're so used to doing it.
[21:40] and we no longer follow our constitution
[21:42] which says the Congress has to declare
[21:44] war and we haven't declared a war since
[21:46] 1945. We went to to to Korea, we went to
[21:49] Vietnam, we went to the Middle East, you
[21:52] know, everywhere. Grenada, Panama,
[21:54] Haiti, the Balkans.
[21:57] Um a and th those are the things that we
[22:01] know
[22:02] about. The United States is conducting
[22:04] military operations all over the globe
[22:06] all all the time. And so um when you
[22:11] live in that environment and that's one
[22:13] of the things that as as you know people
[22:16] who believe in a sound currency that
[22:18] that's why it's very hard for me to buy
[22:20] into notions like fix the money fix the
[22:23] world right I understand the sentiment
[22:26] and I really want it to be true and I
[22:29] really respect Lawrence Leard and the
[22:31] work that he does and and other people
[22:33] who use that term. Um, I want to be on
[22:36] that
[22:38] team, but there's a lot of things that
[22:40] we're going to have to do that might be
[22:42] uncomfortable that have to prevent the
[22:46] current powers in charge of the current
[22:49] system from taking over the system that
[22:52] we want to replace it with. It's is it's
[22:54] it's exactly where I actually wanted to
[22:56] to ask a question. If you think Bitcoin
[22:59] has a chance or has an or will maybe
[23:04] bring those empires down or not down but
[23:08] change how they are structured, make
[23:09] them uh less appealing because a lot of
[23:12] power comes from printing money and then
[23:16] being able to uh afford wars, afford
[23:19] military actions, afford those things.
[23:21] Um, do you think if we move slowly
[23:24] slowly towards a Bitcoin standard, which
[23:26] I think will take a very long time, that
[23:30] those big empires get decentralized long
[23:33] term and get a little
[23:36] bit less
[23:38] empiry.
[23:41] Um, that's a great question. Uh, and I
[23:44] and I
[23:46] don't I don't really have an answer, but
[23:48] like I I think the answer lies in what
[23:50] you said, which is you think going to a
[23:53] Bitcoin standard will take a very long
[23:56] time. And if that's the case, then, and
[23:59] I agree with you, then the answer is
[24:02] it's going to take a very long time. And
[24:05] so, um, and that's why I don't favor,
[24:10] um, I'm against a strategic Bitcoin
[24:12] reserve.
[24:14] I don't favor
[24:16] um government to do anything. So I am
[24:21] not a socialist. I am the ultimate
[24:24] capitalist. Um I don't believe in public
[24:27] education. I don't believe in public
[24:29] health. Uh I don't believe in any of
[24:32] these things only because I don't trust
[24:34] someone else to do it. I want to be
[24:36] involved face to face.
[24:38] Now that being said, um you know there's
[24:42] what is it gradually then then suddenly
[24:46] um is Bitcoin money?
[24:48] Yes. Because I've used it as money and I
[24:52] interact with people who see it as
[24:54] money. So it may not be the global
[24:57] reserve currency. It may not be uh we
[24:59] not may not be on that standard.
[25:02] Um I in fact because I interact with one
[25:05] of your uh sponsors uh uh the Bitcoin
[25:08] way uh couldn't recommend them more.
[25:11] Fantastic.
[25:12] um
[25:14] and um they take Bitcoin and so they're
[25:18] only in and and and so anything that I
[25:20] say any aspersions that I cast on
[25:23] Bitcoiners and if you see my ex-p
[25:25] profofile I'm always attacking
[25:27] Bitcoiners because I'm the harshest on
[25:30] our own team because I I expect more not
[25:33] you um not Brahm Kston not you know
[25:36] there's a whole bunch of people out
[25:37] there that are just doing you know
[25:38] Daniel Prince and uh Bitcoin way guys
[25:41] I'm friendly with those guys and I often
[25:44] tell them, hey, this isn't towards you.
[25:46] Um, I I just I'm not a number go up guy.
[25:51] Uh, does it make me feel, you know, I
[25:52] wrote a little joke today to you, you
[25:54] know, oh yeah, I arranged for Bitcoin to
[25:55] go
[25:56] up. I don't care. What really impresses
[26:00] me more about Bitcoin, uh, is what we
[26:03] just went through with the tariff shock
[26:05] and how well it stood up. That's what
[26:08] that is proof of work right there.
[26:12] Um, and so people can look, you know,
[26:16] we're sorry. Uh, you know, we're at
[26:20] 87,000 somewhere around there. If you
[26:22] had told me that a few years ago, I I
[26:24] take that any day, right? When we were
[26:27] below that 64 dip and and and I don't
[26:29] want to get into price because I don't
[26:31] price in fiat. I price in the amount of
[26:33] Satoshi's that I have. And I know I
[26:35] agree with Jeff Booth that we're going
[26:37] to we're going to get in a deflationary
[26:39] environment eventually. That's going to
[26:41] be good. And the amount of Satoshi's
[26:44] that we have, right, in 10, 15, 20
[26:46] years, you're not going to know anybody
[26:47] who talks in terms of Bitcoin. It's
[26:50] going to be talking in terms of Satoshi
[26:52] because who could imagine having a whole
[26:54] Bitcoin in in the future? That's going
[26:55] to be pretty rough. Um, but I don't
[26:59] support a strategic Bitcoin reserve. I
[27:01] don't support really getting in bed with
[27:03] government.
[27:04] um because that's the system we have to
[27:06] at some point overthrow and
[27:10] replace. And so
[27:13] um for whatever good that Michael Sailor
[27:15] does, I'm against uh printing fiat to
[27:19] buy
[27:20] Bitcoin. That's just a ridiculous notion
[27:22] to me. Um and that Americans get and
[27:26] then America wins and then what does
[27:27] that look like? We maintain the empire
[27:29] for another 200
[27:31] years. I don't want that. I don't want
[27:34] the emp empire. I don't think of myself
[27:38] primarily as a as an American as much as
[27:40] I do as a human being. And so if we look
[27:44] at things like the Hanziatic League,
[27:46] right, in in northern Germany or the
[27:49] German principalities before 1870
[27:52] um and the consolidation of what we now
[27:55] call Germany,
[27:57] um it's these principal I think we're
[28:00] going to go to that model eventually.
[28:02] I'd like to see the empire break down.
[28:04] I'd like to see secession in the United
[28:06] States and people start to identify
[28:09] politically with economic zones with uh
[28:13] lifestyle zones um that reflect a lack
[28:19] of interference in the free market. And
[28:22] so when I think of how a free market
[28:25] works, uh, and that's why I like to do
[28:28] podcasts with people like you is
[28:32] that how the hell did we arrange this,
[28:36] right? How is it that some guy living in
[28:40] Tokyo communicates with a guy in less
[28:44] than half his age in Europe and they
[28:47] work out somehow without coercion or
[28:51] interference or a
[28:55] mandate to have a
[28:57] discussion about serious
[28:59] issues. And
[29:01] um that's to me that's the free market
[29:04] at work, right? It it didn't take any
[29:07] interference. We have similar ideas
[29:10] maybe about Bitcoin. Maybe some
[29:11] differing
[29:12] ideas. Um I know you because you are on
[29:17] a mission to engage with as many people
[29:20] as you can in this space and you've been
[29:22] on that mission for some time and I
[29:24] followed it and and I appreciate the
[29:27] work that you do. You're the hardest
[29:28] working man in show business. Um, and
[29:32] it's a fascinating thing to listen to
[29:34] and I listen to people that I agree with
[29:35] or don't agree with, but that's the
[29:38] market developing and and that what you
[29:40] do, Robin, and what others in the space
[29:43] do. That gives me hope because that
[29:46] shows that the market will
[29:48] develop and and I'm 60 years old and I
[29:53] should be a boomer, right? I am a
[29:55] boomer. I should be in this category of
[29:58] people that don't get it.
[30:00] But somehow I
[30:01] do. And if I can get it, anybody can get
[30:05] it. But as a boomer and as somebody
[30:07] who's lived a pretty long time and had a
[30:11] lot of experience around the world, I
[30:13] guess the message that I bring is don't
[30:16] rely on the government for any of it
[30:20] because they're going to
[30:22] um manipulate whatever they do with
[30:24] Bitcoin and they're going to make it
[30:27] difficult. And it may
[30:28] seem like it's very positive what Trump
[30:31] is doing right now. Trump doesn't
[30:32] understand Bitcoin. He
[30:34] doesn't he doesn't understand
[30:36] anything. He's being
[30:39] fed
[30:41] information. And um and the next person
[30:45] might not be that friendly towards
[30:47] Bitcoin. Um and and if that's where we
[30:50] are, we know when we have a saying that
[30:52] we have the saying that Bitcoin doesn't
[30:54] care. I want Bitcoiners to get more
[30:58] aggressive, right?
[31:01] And act like people who are involved in
[31:05] something that can't be
[31:07] manipulated, right? That we as a
[31:10] community can manage and can control and
[31:13] that we will get together uh and fight
[31:16] for
[31:17] it, however that looks. It's super
[31:21] interesting
[31:22] because I'm very split on the strategic
[31:25] Bitcoin reserve.
[31:26] Obviously, more buyers in the market is
[31:29] is usually good for an asset, but at the
[31:32] same time, we are mostly for freedom go
[31:36] up technology and not
[31:38] for number or money go up technology.
[31:41] And if we really want freedom freedom go
[31:44] up technology as you said it can can
[31:47] prolong that government standing I don't
[31:50] think it can save them but I think it
[31:53] can massively extend the life of a money
[31:56] printer. I think even central banks if
[31:59] they buy Bitcoin um officially or or
[32:03] indirectly or inofficially they could
[32:06] prolong the their life a lot especially
[32:09] the the the Fed or the US Federal
[32:12] Reserve and they they already are in
[32:15] what I think 60 countries um with the US
[32:18] dollar where the country itself does not
[32:21] have any other currency which is is an
[32:24] amazing stance to have from the
[32:26] perspective of of of the Federal
[32:28] Reserve. So the strategic Bitcoin
[32:30] reserve is is interesting. There are
[32:32] people that describe it as a Trojan
[32:34] horse against governments. But then also
[32:37] the the dangerous uh aspect of it of
[32:40] like, hey, maybe they can prolong or
[32:42] extend life longer than we we wanted to
[32:47] and and kind of have the division of a
[32:49] Bitcoin standard later because the
[32:52] government is is buying it. It's I think
[32:56] Jeff Boo as you mentioned Jeff Boof he's
[32:58] I think he made that term famous. He got
[33:01] asked what is the the worst thing about
[33:03] Bitcoin. He said that it's
[33:05] permissionless so also our enemies can
[33:08] buy Bitcoin. So that that's I think a
[33:11] good good angle to look at it. Yeah I I
[33:15] think that's that's right. And look this
[33:17] is an art. It's it's not a science. I I
[33:19] just I have because I spent 36 years in
[33:22] the government. I have zero faith in the
[33:24] government.
[33:25] And my fear is what they'll do is um
[33:31] they'll buy up whatever a million
[33:33] Bitcoin and so they say.
[33:36] Um look, I self-custody, you
[33:40] self-custody. Uh we go through our own
[33:43] proof of work to
[33:46] ensure that we are um strengthening the
[33:51] network. We run a node. we defend it
[33:55] publicly. Um, and who's going to be
[33:58] responsible for that in
[34:00] government? Is it going to be on coin at
[34:04] Coinbase? Is it going to be in the same
[34:06] place where the Fort Knox gold is, where
[34:07] nobody knows where it is?
[34:10] And I think it's going to be too
[34:13] convenient to say, well, we're going to
[34:16] hold this as a store of value and then
[34:19] we're going to issue a US stable coin
[34:20] off of it, and there's your CBDC. M and
[34:24] so the CBDC is
[34:26] concerned my thoughts are we already
[34:30] have
[34:30] it and the reason why I say and it's
[34:33] this isn't a leap I'm sure other people
[34:36] have said it you don't get paid in paper
[34:38] or gold you get paid in digits right so
[34:42] they can shut my bank account off now if
[34:44] they want they did it in Canada
[34:47] um look I can I can work on Bitcoin but
[34:52] it's
[34:53] not that's not going to pay my mortgage
[34:56] and I'm in Japan, right? So my life is
[34:59] Japan, United States. Japan is a vassel
[35:02] of the United States. The yen is based
[35:04] on the US dollar. It's favorable for me
[35:07] right now, the exchange rate, but
[35:09] everything here is done in
[35:10] yen. So
[35:13] um the the hard work of building a CBDC,
[35:17] same thing with Bitcoin.
[35:19] Computers have been developed, networks
[35:21] have been developed, all the the the
[35:23] pipes are are there. Bitcoin was I'm not
[35:27] gonna say it's easy, but it's easy to
[35:29] understand because if you've been in the
[35:31] digital world and you receive, you know,
[35:34] you've got mail, you got money. If you
[35:37] see your bank account go higher because
[35:39] the Department of Defense has given me
[35:42] money.
[35:43] Um, I know that for any reason they
[35:46] could shut that off if they wanted to.
[35:48] So, I'm in the CBDC. Now, when somebody
[35:51] says, "Well, we're just going to use a
[35:53] stable coin." What if they didn't even
[35:54] say it's a stable coin? They just go
[35:57] with what they're what they're doing
[35:58] right now. It's not really a leap to get
[36:01] to some sort of stable coin. And they
[36:02] say that we're going to base it off of
[36:04] Bitcoin. Then, um that gives me concerns
[36:08] about what they're going to do to zero
[36:10] out the debt and some other things that
[36:12] I'm sure that um people like Jeff Booth
[36:14] consider. uh really smart smarter people
[36:17] than me. Um consider uh what the
[36:21] problems are. And and then we get to the
[36:25] um the most important question that we
[36:28] never talk about, which is the spending.
[36:32] And so, and like you said, Bitcoin under
[36:35] or like I said, Bitcoin underwriting a
[36:38] stable coin could perpetuate the system
[36:41] so that we can continue to spend. But
[36:43] Robin, whether they do that or not,
[36:45] they're not stopping spending. And by
[36:48] they, I mean the United States in
[36:50] particular. So we just said we're going
[36:51] to have a hundred, we're gonna have a
[36:52] trillion dollar defense
[36:54] budget to defend against what? I don't
[36:56] know. The European Union is going to
[36:58] spend what, 800
[37:01] billion so that uh Russia doesn't
[37:04] invade. They're going
[37:06] to spend what you don't have and and the
[37:10] the quality of life is going to continue
[37:12] to go down. Life is going to get more
[37:14] challenging. inflation is going to we we
[37:16] know the
[37:17] story and we are not at the point yet
[37:21] and I think until there are people in
[37:22] the streets saying
[37:25] marching and revoling in some way and I
[37:27] I know some people don't like that uh
[37:30] but at some point you have to shut the
[37:34] spigot
[37:35] off and for some reason Americans were
[37:38] foolish enough to believe that Trump was
[37:40] going to come in and be more responsible
[37:43] and he's not was like on day two he
[37:44] announced ounced the $500 billion to
[37:46] Larry Ellison and Sam Alman to do the
[37:48] cancer AI vaccine thing, the $1 trillion
[37:53] defense budget. Um money going left,
[37:56] right, and and for and and the whole I
[37:58] don't want to get on the whole Doge
[38:00] thing which is a complete
[38:03] um
[38:04] scam. Uh it's not going to cut anything.
[38:07] And then the way the US government works
[38:10] is any and they know this anything that
[38:12] gets cut will go into litigation. And
[38:16] there's an entire system in thei United
[38:18] States called administrative
[38:21] law. And the administrative system is
[38:24] where the where civilians go to make
[38:26] their grievances through the office of
[38:28] office of professional management. I was
[38:30] in this system and they will go and they
[38:33] will make claims and it will get
[38:34] litigated and the administration will
[38:37] lose and all of those civilians will get
[38:39] hired and USAD will be turned back on
[38:42] and they'll all get back paid and that
[38:45] and they know that that's the way the
[38:47] system is. If you want to cut
[38:50] government, you don't bring in some
[38:52] external agency to do this band-aid
[38:55] measure. You tell Congress and you tell
[38:59] your Congress men and women to stop
[39:02] spending and to cut it. That's a
[39:04] function of government. But our system
[39:08] doesn't work. Right? And the EU is a
[39:11] collection of unelected members to a
[39:14] parliament that European citizens in
[39:16] their individual nation states get no
[39:19] vote in. And so when they make these
[39:21] pronouncements now that are getting more
[39:23] and more aggressive and are going into
[39:25] the military realm
[39:27] now, people are have no connection with
[39:30] that. And at some point
[39:33] um that's got to come to an end to turn
[39:36] it back to a discussion on
[39:40] Bitcoin. To turn it back to a discussion
[39:42] of Bitcoin, Bitcoin gives us the option
[39:46] that we didn't have before. I believe
[39:48] and you believe that there there is an
[39:51] out there is a superior alternative. But
[39:54] if we're going to go down that road,
[39:56] every one of us in the system in that
[39:58] new system, whether you're somebody in
[40:01] Nigeria who doesn't have a bank account
[40:04] and and is able to get through a cell
[40:07] phone, able to use Satoshi's to buy
[40:10] something, or you're Michael Sailor,
[40:13] everybody gets an equal vote in that
[40:15] system. and and and from the bottom up
[40:19] from the
[40:20] localities through the states or the
[40:22] prefixures or the or or or wherever it
[40:24] is that you live, it's going to be from
[40:27] the bottom up that these markets form, I
[40:29] believe. Uh based on communities and
[40:32] community priorities that's going to
[40:34] give Bitcoin that chance. But between
[40:36] now and then, what that looks like, I
[40:38] don't know. Let's take a break for a
[40:40] moment and appreciate the beauty that
[40:42] Coin Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[40:46] watches. Those watches are the most
[40:48] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[40:51] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[40:54] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[40:57] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[41:00] watch collections. You have the date of
[41:03] the first ever mined Bitcoin block in
[41:06] there and of course also the block
[41:08] height and which epoch we are currently
[41:11] in. I love the level of detail they put
[41:14] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[41:17] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[41:19] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[41:22] love those watches so so much. And now
[41:25] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[41:28] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[41:30] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[41:32] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[41:34] first way is you put it on a hardware
[41:36] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[41:39] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[41:42] Bitbox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[41:45] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[41:48] if you check out the link in the
[41:50] description, you even get 5% off if you
[41:53] use the code Robin. And the second way
[41:55] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[41:58] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[42:02] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[42:05] They will personalize for you a
[42:07] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[42:09] your individual situation. They will
[42:12] show you how you can secure your own
[42:15] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[42:17] enough. You also have to keep all your
[42:19] devices secure. One topic that is
[42:22] overlooked often is the inheritance
[42:24] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[42:27] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[42:30] a plan for that in place already? And
[42:32] last but not least, if you're in a
[42:34] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[42:36] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[42:39] that, head over to the
[42:43] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[42:46] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[42:48] be for the first time ever speaking at
[42:51] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[42:54] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[42:56] really looking forward to seeing all of
[42:58] you there. You can get your ticket in
[43:01] the link down in the description of
[43:03] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[43:05] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[43:09] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[43:11] there. It's a two question that that we
[43:14] we still have. Like mo most Bitcoiners
[43:17] are very like I'm very um convinced that
[43:21] we will get to this Bitcoin standard
[43:22] eventually or to a sound money standard.
[43:25] I most likely think it's it's probably
[43:28] Bitcoin and then to the on the way there
[43:32] there's a lot of question do we come
[43:35] peacefully there uh do we come through
[43:38] civil wars other wars uh there um and
[43:42] how quick is this going to be? like is
[43:44] it like and uh uh slowly then gradually
[43:48] then suddenly or is it like this
[43:50] gradually till we'll get there? Uh is
[43:53] there like some some peak moment in
[43:55] there where all of the sudden it makes
[43:57] sense and and we uh have one year that
[44:02] where we go from 1% 5% adoption to like
[44:05] 50 60 70% adoption. I think it's
[44:09] probably longer. It's probably more
[44:10] organic. Um but yeah, I could be wrong
[44:13] on that. um history will teach us what
[44:16] you but we mentioned it right in the
[44:19] beginning uh where we are in in the
[44:22] Bitcoin journey. How how would you
[44:24] describe it where where we are currently
[44:25] in in the Bitcoin journey? How far we
[44:27] are along and and and and and how how
[44:31] innovatable do you think it already is?
[44:35] I think and this is where
[44:38] um I think as we go along this
[44:44] timeline we are going to discover that
[44:47] there is
[44:48] um less in common amongst us because at
[44:53] the beginning of the
[44:55] journey we all had one thing that we
[44:58] believed in and it's Bitcoin and then as
[45:01] we go through the journey we find out we
[45:03] start asking more questions about each
[45:05] other and we start finding out. You may
[45:07] find out things about the person
[45:10] that end that relationship. Ju just like
[45:13] in life, right? I
[45:15] don't I don't keep in touch with anybody
[45:18] from my high school or from university.
[45:21] I have some army friends. Um you may end
[45:24] up having more Bitcoin friends or
[45:26] depending on I have more jiu-jitsu
[45:27] friends. I have more
[45:30] um armies probably the most.
[45:34] Um,
[45:35] but one of the things that I kind of get
[45:38] frustrated with in the so-called
[45:40] community is that look, and this is one
[45:43] of the reasons why I say, you know, fix
[45:45] the money, fix the world is a little bit
[45:46] problematic. It
[45:48] um, you can have Bitcoin, but you could
[45:52] beat your wife, right? You could have
[45:54] Bitcoin and be a drunk. You could have
[45:57] Bitcoin and be
[45:58] obese. You could have Bitcoin and and
[46:00] all sorts of different things. And and
[46:02] one of the things that I see most
[46:05] um flagrantly is you could think that
[46:10] Bitcoin is the thing that you need to
[46:12] know about and do research about. Right?
[46:14] What I tell my kids is life is like
[46:17] imagine you have a table and you have
[46:20] all these a bunch of cylinders like this
[46:22] on it. say a hundred
[46:25] cylinders and right you only have so
[46:29] much time, right? We talk about that
[46:31] time preference or whatever and you can
[46:33] choose to go
[46:34] down these some of into some of these
[46:37] cylinders which represent
[46:41] journeys and you could decide like my
[46:44] kids do jiu-jitsu, they do
[46:46] weightlifting, we do homeschooling. You
[46:48] could go down and there are people that
[46:50] go all the way down, right? You can call
[46:52] it the rabbit hole if you want. And
[46:55] there are people that live in that
[46:57] Bitcoin right in in the in the Bitcoin
[47:00] tube. I don't I I I I I understand what
[47:05] it is and I think I get how it work, you
[47:09] know, uh and this is this has nothing to
[47:11] do with anything, but because I still
[47:13] map out things in my mind, but the first
[47:15] time I saw the memool and the first time
[47:18] I saw the structure of the time chain
[47:22] and and blocks form, it blew my mind
[47:27] because I done all this reading. I
[47:29] understand the philosophy. I understand
[47:32] the economics, the finances behind it.
[47:34] But until I actually saw that, that's
[47:37] why I was like, ah, that's it. There was
[47:39] there was an emotional moment. And I
[47:40] think it's an emot an emotional moment
[47:43] for a lot of folks. Same thing when you
[47:44] set up your own wallet or you know,
[47:47] um, but uh, we have to be aware that at
[47:52] least these other things exist and that
[47:55] those things may be
[47:57] impeded, right? there may be something
[48:00] going on in one of those tubes that
[48:02] affects your life more than you being in
[48:04] the Bitcoin tube, right? So, if you're
[48:08] not paying attention, if you're not
[48:10] reading geopolitics, and my my space is
[48:12] the geopolitical world, not Bitcoin, uh
[48:15] it's conflict zones,
[48:18] it's where my government is spending
[48:21] money and resources to kill people
[48:23] today.
[48:25] Um, and as a matter of policy, sending
[48:29] its troops all over the world or naval
[48:33] forces to bomb Yemen. Right? That's what
[48:35] the United States does right now. We
[48:36] haven't declared war. I have nothing. I
[48:39] don't wake up in the morning and go,
[48:40] "Damn, those Yemenes. I hate them. I
[48:43] don't hate the Chinese. I don't hate the
[48:46] Russians. I don't even hate the
[48:47] Austrians." Um, and so, uh, but my
[48:51] government takes my tax resources and
[48:55] does these things with them. So, if I'm
[48:56] not aware, at least tangentially, of
[49:00] what's going on in some of these other
[49:04] cylinders, I shouldn't be
[49:06] surprised when at some point, well, I
[49:10] think I'm doing everything right. I'm
[49:12] homeschooling. I eat healthy. I'm
[49:15] retired. I'm lowering my time
[49:17] preference. I've figured out Bitcoin.
[49:20] Um, and somebody knocks on my door and
[49:24] they put me in handcuffs and throw me in
[49:26] jail because I made an unpopular
[49:29] statement about the
[49:31] government, whether that's in the UK,
[49:34] whether that's in the United States. And
[49:36] the difficult thing for Bitcoiners is
[49:42] um it gets very much to be a gray zone
[49:46] when they take somebody off the street
[49:49] and they ship them off to El Salvador
[49:51] and they put them in a
[49:54] notoriously violent prison that's run by
[49:58] one of the Bitcoin heroes. And to me,
[50:03] because I'm a human being before I am a
[50:06] Bitcoiner, that all look I don't I don't
[50:10] get into this uh Bitcoin beach and using
[50:13] the nightlighting network and all that,
[50:16] you know, and interviewing people in
[50:17] front of the volcanoes. That's great. If
[50:18] that's your thing, do it. It does
[50:20] nothing for
[50:21] me because I've realized in my life
[50:24] there are no heroes, right? Everybody
[50:26] that they told me was a hero, like
[50:28] Abraham Lincoln, turns out to be a
[50:31] psychopath. So when Boule goes to visit
[50:36] Trump and he wouldn't have got asked if
[50:39] he didn't agree to the prison deal,
[50:42] um you have to start being able to
[50:45] question who your allies are. And if he
[50:49] went on X and because he speaks perfect
[50:52] English, um, and said,
[50:55] "Hey,
[50:57] uh, I know this is a bad look and, um,
[51:01] I'm reviewing all everybody that we put
[51:03] in prison. Uh, I don't want to have
[51:05] this, uh, I don't want to appear to be
[51:06] some sort of typical Central American
[51:08] thug." Uh, but it's not a good look at
[51:11] the very least. And so the problem is is
[51:15] if you're going to be in a photograph
[51:17] with anyone, so now there's Trump and
[51:21] Boulli. And whatever any of those people
[51:24] are associated with, and I don't mean to
[51:25] just pick on them, they're two of the
[51:28] most egregious. I think
[51:31] um everybody has to
[51:33] associate with what their historical
[51:37] narrative
[51:38] is. whether you know people in popular
[51:41] American
[51:43] uh media like RFK Jr. or any of these
[51:47] people when they say certain things when
[51:49] they do certain things when they're in
[51:51] photos with certain people they have to
[51:53] be scrutinized. I don't care if they say
[51:55] positive things about
[51:57] Bitcoin, right? And
[52:00] so in the military we um would do
[52:06] analysis, right? intelligence
[52:08] preparation of the battlefield, IPB.
[52:10] It's what DOT is notorious for. It's
[52:12] what the NS NSA does. It what CIA does.
[52:15] When I was in graduate school, my mentor
[52:18] was a CIA
[52:19] analyst. And he taught us how to analyze
[52:23] information that would be pertinent to
[52:25] the leadership. And then we would write
[52:27] up reports and send them up. And so if I
[52:31] took somebody and didn't scrutinize
[52:35] their entire life, right, RFK Jr., he's
[52:40] got a pretty sorted background. And if
[52:43] you're going to ignore that and just
[52:44] say, "Well, he said positive things
[52:46] about Bitcoin or he said positive things
[52:49] about vaccines cuz it's my thing." I'm
[52:51] gonna come back. Like if you were if you
[52:53] were the CEO of our company and you
[52:55] said, "Darren, I need I'm going to make
[52:58] an investment in a company run by these
[53:02] people. I need some background." Okay,
[53:05] I'll go and I'll do it. And if I come
[53:07] back and I give you the dossier on RFK
[53:11] Jr. or somebody
[53:13] else, you're probably going to go
[53:15] through it and go, I don't want him
[53:17] watching my kids, let alone making a
[53:20] multi-billion dollar investment that
[53:22] involves him. And I'm not implying that
[53:25] towards RFK Jr. I'm using an example
[53:28] because he's an egregious example of a
[53:30] public figure who's been out there for
[53:32] many years. There's a lot of information
[53:35] on him and it's out there. Same thing
[53:37] with Elon. Same thing with Trump.
[53:40] And so when we're going to get to the
[53:44] point as people
[53:46] who appreciate this money where we're
[53:50] going to say,
[53:52] um, I don't know. I got to take a look
[53:54] at the Trump tariffs and see if they're
[53:55] good or bad. If you haven't worked out
[53:58] ahead of time, if you're somebody that's
[54:01] into Bitcoin and you haven't worked out
[54:03] that tariffs are a bad idea, that
[54:06] they're a drain on the economy. I know
[54:08] that as a first principle, right? And
[54:10] then I'll just go through and I'm on
[54:12] misuses.org right now and I'll read all
[54:15] that stuff and I've I've read it over
[54:17] and over and over. And when we talk
[54:20] about the free market or the free market
[54:23] of ideas, um we are talking about a
[54:28] paradigm where there aren't external
[54:31] negative forces that impact the freedom
[54:35] of entities to interact. Right? So
[54:40] ultimately what we are talking
[54:42] about with Bitcoin the vision my vision
[54:46] for Bitcoin is
[54:48] um end to end peer-to-peer right it's a
[54:54] peer-to-peer electronic cash system and
[54:57] that if I want to buy something from you
[54:59] I go online I go click I buy it I send
[55:03] you my SATs you send me the thing and by
[55:07] word of mouth
[55:08] we build out and say I did it with uh
[55:12] when I bought um my node uh wherever it
[55:16] was and they DHL comes to my my house
[55:20] end to end we don't need governments
[55:23] sorry we don't need governments we don't
[55:25] need interference we need the
[55:28] market Bitcoin can do that governments
[55:32] are rapacious because they add nothing
[55:34] they don't make the product they don't
[55:38] put the desire in me to to separate with
[55:41] my money to buy that product. Um, and
[55:44] they have to they want to get involved
[55:46] in the marketplace because they have to
[55:50] extract their resources so that they can
[55:53] go spend a trillion dollars on the
[55:56] Department of Defense so that they can
[55:57] go bomb people. That I don't
[56:00] know. I know it was a little bit of an
[56:02] aside, but kind of interconnected.
[56:08] I I love the last last line how they do
[56:11] it. It's it's so interesting because
[56:13] there are a lot of Bitcoiners that uh
[56:16] that clearly just want number. They they
[56:19] clearly is like, "Okay, I love an ETF.
[56:22] Uh I don't care if I custody it myself."
[56:25] They even say like, "Oh, I diversify.
[56:27] have some self custody or like some some
[56:30] ETF and stuff like that. Uh and and if
[56:32] we look at the numbers, most Bitcoiners
[56:34] don't even have self custody. If we
[56:36] actually look at like if we declare
[56:39] everyone a Bitcoiner who has
[56:41] Bitcoin, then most Bitcoiners by far
[56:45] never touched an hardware wallet or did
[56:47] anything uh close to self- custody.
[56:51] So, it's an interesting question like
[56:54] what are the what is a Bitcoin and and
[56:57] how do we get to a Bitcoin standard? How
[57:00] how does this Bitcoin standard look like
[57:03] and and will it be an I think you said
[57:06] revolution or evolution? So, with h how
[57:09] how peaceful
[57:11] uh will that transition be? How do you
[57:14] look at those two different paths
[57:17] towards uh towards Bitcoin standard?
[57:22] Yeah. And I think that you know what
[57:24] what you said um really made me think
[57:27] because I didn't really think about it
[57:30] until you said it. Of course, I've heard
[57:31] it. But the fact that people don't self
[57:36] custody,
[57:38] maybe that's why I look at it or we look
[57:42] at it the way that we do and and because
[57:46] I bought into this whole notion that
[57:50] um Bitcoin doesn't care, right? Tik Tok
[57:53] next block. And then when I get right
[57:56] and and I'm not, like I said, I'm a
[57:58] boomer. I'm 60. I don't I'm not supposed
[58:00] to understand this
[58:01] stuff. But um but if I can understand
[58:05] UTXO
[58:06] consolidation, right, and if I can
[58:08] understand
[58:11] um how I'm going to manage my own bank,
[58:17] be my be my own bank. Then I start to
[58:20] question, why do my resources have to go
[58:23] anywhere? I already paid taxes on the
[58:26] money that I earned to buy the Bitcoin,
[58:29] right? I pay income tax. So, I paid
[58:32] taxes on that and I chose it's the same
[58:34] thing in um in investing. So, rather
[58:38] than buy cocaine or um you know do
[58:43] something unproductive with my money
[58:46] since I was young, I invested it. I put
[58:49] it in
[58:50] IAS and then the government charges me
[58:55] income tax and if I want to use it out
[58:59] of a take it out of an IRA I've got to
[59:01] pay capital gains tax. I've got to pay
[59:04] you know or if I have a nonretirement
[59:07] account and I have I have to pay
[59:09] short-term or long-term capital gains
[59:11] because I chose to invest it and I made
[59:13] money off of it and I'm not a
[59:15] multi-billionaire and I can't hide it in
[59:17] a tax structure. Although I can to an
[59:20] extent, but it's not
[59:22] cost-effective. Like Safe talks about in
[59:25] the Bitcoin standard and like he talks a
[59:27] lot on his podcast, once I have this
[59:29] thing where I can be my own bank, then
[59:32] it opens up all these possibilities. But
[59:35] what frustrates me, it's just like what
[59:36] you said. I'm I'm indifferent about an
[59:40] ETF.
[59:42] Um, probably I would prefer that it not
[59:45] be there because it's the same old these
[59:48] Larry Frink is not a good
[59:51] guy. It he's just so um and and like I
[59:56] said, there are no heroes. Michael
[59:58] Sailor's not going to jump in to pull
[60:01] you off if you fall into the ocean. He
[60:03] ain't jumping in. I'm just telling you.
[60:05] He's he doesn't have the moral character
[60:08] or five. That's just my I know people
[60:09] are going to get all pissed off. Um I
[60:12] like Michael Sailor because I invested
[60:15] in Micro Strategy. Why did I invest in
[60:17] Micro Strategy? because my money was
[60:19] trapped in a US um tax deferred uh uh
[60:25] like a 401k system and I can't buy spo
[60:29] spot bitcoin and although Charles Schwab
[60:30] just announced you can buy spot bitcoin
[60:33] but if I buy spot bitcoin there unless I
[60:35] can export it to a hard wallet and it's
[60:38] all KYC anyway I know
[60:41] that you know you're you're you're
[60:43] dealing with um compromises and so I
[60:48] like Michael Sailor because his company
[60:50] did very well. I bought it like two and
[60:52] a half years ago and it went on a pretty
[60:55] good run and
[60:57] um um I like that he is an evangelist
[61:02] and he makes number go up for Micro
[61:05] Strategy. That's fine with me. But um I
[61:10] don't expect anything from billionaires
[61:12] other than them wanting to improve their
[61:16] bottom line. And that's okay. Hey,
[61:17] that's the responsibility. He's not
[61:19] going to come out and speak out against
[61:21] Bouetle. He's not going to talk about uh
[61:24] them shutting down free speech on
[61:26] college campuses. He's not going to be
[61:28] that guy. But we're going to have to
[61:30] have those people and those because
[61:33] ultimately that's how you defend the
[61:36] network because what's the point if
[61:38] we're sitting on a pile of the perfect
[61:40] money and we can't speak freely and we
[61:43] can't educate our kids the way we want
[61:46] and we can't expect
[61:48] uh to have a free life so
[61:51] that you know that that that our that
[61:54] our time preference goes down and that
[61:56] our that our lives improve. So, and then
[62:00] back to this kind of idea of the
[62:02] cylinders. You might say, "Hey, all I'm
[62:04] going to do is I'm just going to do
[62:06] Bitcoin." I'm not talking about you,
[62:07] Robin. You got You have to It's your
[62:11] job. But I'm going to ignore this
[62:15] militarism in Europe, right? And then in
[62:19] two years, right, you get conscripted
[62:22] and now you're in the front lines in
[62:24] Ukraine going, "What the hell? I'm a
[62:27] podcast host. What am I doing here?
[62:30] That's what happened in 1914 in Austria.
[62:33] Right? And then the world just caught
[62:36] flame. So,
[62:40] uh there's going to be external forces
[62:43] that maybe control your life if we don't
[62:47] take the opportunity at some point to
[62:50] speak out against the things that we
[62:52] disagree with that our current
[62:54] government is doing. So when I talk
[62:57] about it's not going to be fix the
[62:59] money, fix the world, I'm just saying
[63:00] that can't be the broomemide that we use
[63:02] for everything. Well, I'm going to sit
[63:04] around and I'm just going to buy Bitcoin
[63:06] coin and I'm going to hodddle and I'm
[63:08] going to do my thing and I'm just going
[63:10] to let the world do whatever it does and
[63:13] then and that's
[63:16] fine. But let's not preach that we're
[63:19] better than any other normie because
[63:21] we've got a better money. We can't say
[63:23] it then. At some point, we have to back
[63:26] it up. At some point when people are
[63:28] getting thrown in jail for freedom of
[63:30] speech of or for violating
[63:34] uh speech codes or laws or um when
[63:37] people are getting bombed with our tax
[63:40] dollars in the current fiat system,
[63:43] let's not
[63:45] uh uh
[63:47] conclude that what we have to do is to
[63:50] strengthen that system with Bitcoin.
[63:54] That's the reason
[63:57] why I was into politics before um I was
[64:01] in Bitcoin uh and I was basically on a
[64:04] in a in a y organization of a of a
[64:08] political party the more and more I got
[64:11] into bitcoin the more and more I got out
[64:13] of that um funny enough and now
[64:17] basically the last like let's say half
[64:19] year to a year I started to again pay
[64:23] attention to politics ics not because
[64:25] it's fun but because I see that politics
[64:30] very much can not control my life but
[64:33] yeah they they could control my life but
[64:36] definitely they have an impact an
[64:38] influence on my daily life. So if I
[64:42] because I live in in Austria I have to
[64:44] pay attention to what is the Austrian
[64:46] government doing and what is the EU
[64:49] doing. Those are the b those two things
[64:52] above me. So the same in America if you
[64:54] live uh in in I don't know Arizona I
[64:58] don't know Florida wherever you live you
[65:01] have to state level and then also
[65:03] federal level and you've seen what are
[65:05] the politics things and then if you want
[65:07] to go beyond you see a little bit geop
[65:09] politics like what are what are the
[65:11] things but you I think you also have to
[65:14] be careful to not just consume politics
[65:16] all day long because I think uh then
[65:18] then you forget that you actually have
[65:20] to do that you do something with your
[65:22] life. So, but I think it's important to
[65:25] pay attention what's going on in the
[65:27] world, especially to those things that
[65:30] impact your life. For example, in
[65:31] Austria, we have every few weeks a
[65:34] parliament session where all the
[65:36] parliament comes together and discusses
[65:38] what's what's changing in the law. I
[65:41] always listen to all all of those uh
[65:44] sessions. First of all, it's not a lot.
[65:46] It's just like every few weeks there's
[65:47] like uh and one day in and session it's
[65:51] it's it's a quick listen and you can
[65:53] skip through through it. You you don't
[65:55] have to listen like 12 hours. You can
[65:57] basically listen to like probably takes
[65:58] me 2 hours to to get through the whole
[66:00] thing with 2x speed and stuff like that.
[66:02] And there are a lot of Bitcoiners that
[66:04] actually say um I have
[66:07] Bitcoin. I don't have to care about
[66:09] politics.
[66:10] Yeah, maybe you don't have to like you
[66:12] don't have to go on the on uh you don't
[66:15] have to make your own political party or
[66:17] or like call every senator. Maybe it is
[66:21] a good thing to do that, but you don't
[66:22] have to do that. But at
[66:25] least at least see what's going on so
[66:29] you can react because Bitcoin will
[66:31] probably be fine. like Bitcoin doesn't
[66:34] care about uh politics long term, but
[66:37] you should and you might care what's
[66:40] going on with politics and maybe Austria
[66:43] is a bad place to be for for Bitcoiners
[66:46] and if it turns out that way and if I
[66:48] listen to the news, I I might catch
[66:50] catch it early enough so I can move to I
[66:53] don't know Tokyo, America, wherever
[66:56] where I'm treated better as a Bitcoiner.
[66:59] So I do think uh listening to the
[67:03] [Music]
[67:04] news is something that can hurt you your
[67:08] health because it's like there always
[67:10] negative news and stuff like that. I I
[67:12] don't like that part but it's important
[67:14] if you want to defend yourself if you
[67:16] defend uh your wife you if you want to
[67:19] defend your family and and if you want
[67:21] to see where where the world is going.
[67:23] So, I very much agree with that message
[67:26] of it's not just Bitcoin. And actually,
[67:28] that's why I have the last question uh
[67:31] of of the the last question from me in
[67:34] the podcast. What can we learn from you
[67:36] besides Bitcoin because I want to put
[67:38] more and more out and that's also the
[67:40] reason why I don't call it um what
[67:43] Bitcoin did, Bitcoin for millennials.
[67:44] Like all the Bitcoin podcast usually
[67:46] have Bitcoin in the name as it's better
[67:48] for marketing. I I decided not to do
[67:52] that. It's just a Robin Sire podcast.
[67:54] First of all, maybe I speak about
[67:56] something else and then people cannot
[67:59] say, "Oh, this whole podcast you didn't
[68:01] talk about Bitcoin." Yeah, it happens. I
[68:03] I had a podcast with Lisa Huff and we
[68:06] talked about parenting and
[68:07] homeschooling. We mentioned and I I can
[68:10] search in a transcript. We mentioned
[68:11] Bitcoin three times when I had Sale on.
[68:15] We mentioned Bitcoin what was it 150
[68:18] times or almost 200 in like one and a
[68:20] half hours.
[68:22] So, uh, yeah, I think it's I think it's
[68:25] important to have interests outside of
[68:28] Bitcoin. And second, it's very important
[68:30] to see what's going on with your local
[68:32] news in a local um jurisdiction and then
[68:35] also the the water heads above it, be it
[68:38] the Federal Reserve, be it the EU. Yeah,
[68:40] I agree. And I didn't even realize that
[68:42] about your podcast. And so I think
[68:45] that's um very wise because I think uh
[68:49] say we do reach a Bitcoin standard or
[68:51] something, there's going to be a lot
[68:52] less to talk about at some point. I
[68:54] mean, you might be my age. Um but
[68:58] uh and I'm mostly active, you know, on X
[69:01] being just a, you know, sometimes I'll
[69:04] go back and read some stuff and I'm just
[69:06] like this angry old man and a lot of it
[69:08] is just because I watch the things play
[69:10] out. uh violence being committed around
[69:13] the world and and that's why I don't
[69:17] really buy into this notion of America
[69:21] first. I just I just have never been
[69:23] maybe it's because I've lived all over
[69:25] the world, but like you said, you use
[69:27] the term, you know, go where you're
[69:29] treated best.
[69:31] Um, and
[69:33] um, and and and I've I've always liked
[69:36] that sentiment and and um, uh, I I
[69:40] believe that's why I ended up in Japan
[69:43] where Japan's got its own problems. It's
[69:45] got their government is just too big and
[69:48] bloated. Um, they uh, have too much
[69:52] public debt. Uh, the population is
[69:55] crashing because no one can afford to
[69:58] get married and have kids.
[70:00] Um, but it is a
[70:03] fantastic place to live and for me in
[70:06] particular where I retired with a decent
[70:09] amount of money. Um, Bitcoin allowed me
[70:13] to retire. You know, I was forced out of
[70:15] DoD because of my I was on a COVID task
[70:17] force. I refused the vaccines. Um, and
[70:22] Austrian economics believing Bitcoiner
[70:25] is not going to go very far in the
[70:27] Department of Defense. and eventually
[70:30] um your opinions about everything about
[70:32] war. I'm anti-war
[70:34] um I'm anti-state
[70:36] um and
[70:39] um you know at some point we as you know
[70:45] what I'll say about people who have
[70:48] arrived at Bitcoin as being money have
[70:51] gone through some sort of metamorphosis.
[70:54] they've gone through some sort of
[70:56] thought
[70:57] process and most are fairly thoughtful
[71:01] people. So I I will, you know, I'm very
[71:03] guarded and careful to say things about
[71:05] the community or whatever. But, you
[71:08] know, when you run into people, it turns
[71:09] out that a lot of people are carnivores
[71:11] or a lot of people like jiu-jitsu or a
[71:13] lot of people homeschool. You know, Lisa
[71:15] Hoffen, um, and I've listened to her on
[71:18] several podcasts. I think I listen to
[71:19] her on on your show. Um, we have
[71:22] differences. We have similarities. Um,
[71:25] you know, mainly because I have sons and
[71:27] we lift weights and do jiu-jitsu and do,
[71:29] you know, uh, manly things. Um, but, um,
[71:34] but going where you're treated best, you
[71:36] know, Japan is, uh, and you may see
[71:38] there's a lot of,
[71:40] uh, videos on X about Asia now with
[71:44] especially Chinese trolling Americans
[71:47] for, well, you know, you want the
[71:48] tariffs, you want, you know, you know,
[71:49] you want to do these miserable jobs that
[71:51] we've been doing.
[71:53] Um, and in Japan, it's a high trust
[71:57] society. I live in Tokyo, kind of a
[72:00] more, you know, suburban area. I could
[72:03] leave my doors open
[72:05] 24/7. Um, you know, if you leave
[72:07] something on the train, somebody will
[72:09] you'll you'll you'll get it. You'll go
[72:10] to Lost and Found and it will be there.
[72:13] There's no public violence. People
[72:14] aren't yelling on the trains. They're
[72:16] quiet. You know, sometimes the trains
[72:17] are crowded. Um I I don't know the last
[72:21] time I've seen a policeman. You know,
[72:23] they have them in certain air like in a
[72:25] coban or whatever, but it's not like in
[72:28] the States where it's militarized. They
[72:31] don't have police SWAT teams here. Um
[72:35] just, you know, you can drink beer
[72:36] publicly or, you know, it's pretty
[72:38] chill. And um and you know, say and and
[72:43] I think that's a perfect way to
[72:45] encapsulate it. um Robin in that um I'm
[72:49] not I don't spend American politics
[72:51] sickens me so I can't spend a lot of
[72:53] time listening to because everybody in
[72:56] the legislature is a
[72:58] loser. Um Trump
[73:01] is, you know, I'm I'm just not aligned
[73:04] to any political party, but Trump's been
[73:07] a bozo throughout my entire life. And
[73:10] I'm not I'm I am more conservative than
[73:13] Aillaa the Hunt. He is not conservative.
[73:16] I am an arch capitalist. Meaning in the
[73:19] traditional sense, in the safe moo sense
[73:22] and that capitalists are people that
[73:24] take money and invest it in capital and
[73:26] then develop businesses and products
[73:29] like capital goods to create consumer
[73:31] goods that we all use and that
[73:34] eventually over time uh if you're not uh
[73:37] if you don't have a rapacious
[73:39] government, you get into what Jeff Booth
[73:41] is talking about. you get into a
[73:42] deflationary cycle and the currency that
[73:44] you're using, especially if it's not um
[73:47] or the money rather, not the currency
[73:49] because it's not it's not issued by a
[73:51] central government,
[73:53] uh that that that we can survive off of
[73:55] that and then we can figure out what we
[73:58] need in that
[73:59] marketplace. And so I'm going to go to
[74:01] you and and say, "Hey, you know, I've
[74:04] got a I got a back problem. Do you have
[74:07] a good chiropractor?" Or, "No, but I
[74:09] know a guy who knows a guy." And in the
[74:11] private market, you're going to find
[74:12] you're not going to be set up with
[74:14] somebody that's going to try to get you
[74:17] to take a vaccine that you don't want to
[74:19] take. You're outside of this alipathic
[74:22] system, right? If I go over your to your
[74:24] house to eat, I'm probably expecting
[74:27] that I'm going to eat something that is
[74:28] not going to kill me. Um, and so I keep
[74:33] up with politics as far as I understand
[74:37] what the threats might be. So, if you
[74:39] decide that you want to go where you're
[74:41] treated best and I decide where I I want
[74:43] to go where I'm treated best and that
[74:45] happens to be Panama and we communicate
[74:47] with each other and then you do this
[74:50] like plan B like Bitcoin Way has and you
[74:53] go through that process and you're like,
[74:55] "Okay, well, I know Robin's here. I know
[74:57] a few other people are here um in that
[75:00] society depending on what your belief
[75:01] system is. My belief system is to be
[75:03] armed. You can be armed in Panama." And
[75:06] then we look out for you. You have to go
[75:07] to Austria. You have to go to a Bitcoin
[75:09] conference. Darren, can you watch my
[75:11] place? I got it, man. And you know you
[75:13] can trust me. And so you've got this
[75:15] community of people. Can you teach my
[75:17] kids English? Sure. Can your wife teach
[75:19] my kids German? My wife teaches my kids
[75:22] Japanese. That's just going to work
[75:24] itself out. And and I do believe at the
[75:27] end of the day that we're going to get
[75:29] to that type of system and that we can
[75:31] build out those
[75:33] communities. But at some point we may
[75:36] have to have some sort of at least
[75:38] political confrontation with the powers
[75:41] that be to ensure that the empire is not
[75:44] going to come knocking on your door.
[75:46] We've all seen Star Wars, right? It's
[75:48] not good when the empire arrives. And so
[75:51] Panama that runs on the dollar that's
[75:54] really, you know, you can see the United
[75:56] States, you know, Trump says, "I want
[75:57] the Panama Canal back and Trump says I
[76:00] want to send prisoners to El Salvador."
[76:01] That's how the Western Hemisphere has
[76:04] been for, you know, 150 years. And so
[76:08] that's going to affect every one of us.
[76:10] We're not going to be able to run away.
[76:12] At some point, we might have to make
[76:13] some sort of commitment. And I don't
[76:15] know what that looks like. I don't know
[76:17] if it's violent or nonviolent, but at
[76:18] some point, you know, people like us, or
[76:23] rather people older than you, you know,
[76:25] my generation, um, especially, let's
[76:28] say, Republicans always used to say,
[76:30] "Well, this isn't the hill to die on."
[76:32] Right? So, abortion isn't the hill to
[76:33] die on. Yeah, but I'm against it. But
[76:36] it's not the hill to die on. Gay
[76:37] marriage is not the hill to die on.
[76:39] Whatever your belief system is, if
[76:41] you're a Republican, you're probably a
[76:43] Christian conservative. Maybe not. But
[76:46] if you have similar belief systems and
[76:47] you say this is not the hill to die on,
[76:50] don't be surprised when you find
[76:51] yourself 15 hills back and you're
[76:54] overrun because you've given up all the
[76:57] terrain. And if what we've decided is
[76:59] that our hill to die on is this
[77:03] permissionless
[77:05] uh perfect uh decentralized
[77:08] um uh money that we all agree as money
[77:12] and that we're going to use to exchange
[77:14] with each other. If we decide that's the
[77:16] hill to die on, damn it, at some point
[77:18] we've got to defend it. I think that's a
[77:20] perfect way of of of ending the actual
[77:23] podcast. Um, we have two more questions.
[77:25] The first question, as I already teased,
[77:27] is the question that uh I asked each and
[77:30] every one of the guests, and the
[77:31] question is, what can we learn from you
[77:33] besides Bitcoin? Um, what can you learn
[77:36] from me besides
[77:38] Bitcoin?
[77:40] Uh, don't trust the government. I love
[77:44] that. Maybe maybe there are some some
[77:47] Bitcoiners that also learn that from the
[77:50] from Bitcoin. Yeah. And you know, for
[77:52] Americans, um it would be
[77:55] uh you know, there's just so many
[77:57] things, but in particular, I always tell
[77:59] people, don't let your kids join the
[78:01] military. Um for the in the United
[78:04] States, I think you learn a lot of great
[78:06] things in the military, and I think it's
[78:08] it was a wonderful experience for me.
[78:11] Uh, and my kid my kids won't. They they
[78:14] just I've just trained them uh too well.
[78:17] Um, and and then something else is is uh
[78:21] to be as self-sufficient as you can. And
[78:24] I know you probably are. Uh, Robin, you
[78:27] look fit. Um, you know, that means
[78:29] eating right. That means uh exercising.
[78:33] That means uh taking care of your
[78:35] health. Your health is number one. Look,
[78:38] your health, your family, whatever your
[78:40] relationship is with God,
[78:43] um your morality, your sense of ethics,
[78:48] love, loving your fellow man, having
[78:50] respect for your fellow man. Uh the Ten
[78:54] Commandments are probably a pretty good
[78:55] guide, but maybe they've been too
[78:57] politicized. Um the non-aggression
[79:00] principle. I I don't wake up any day.
[79:03] I'm a lifelong soldier. The life of the
[79:05] soldier is not to kill people. But the
[79:06] life of the soldier should be in a
[79:08] republic to defend the
[79:11] population. And unfortunately, my
[79:13] population, my my military doesn't do
[79:15] that anymore. It spreads pain pain and
[79:18] grief around the world. And um I I wish
[79:21] nothing but um good tidings for my
[79:24] fellow man. That's all. I love that.
[79:27] Really cool. Um we have the second
[79:29] question is the end routine question
[79:31] where the previous guest is asking a
[79:33] question for the next guest without
[79:34] knowing who the next guest actually is.
[79:36] The question from the previous guest to
[79:38] you is what do you believe the deeper
[79:41] philosophical purpose of Bitcoin is?
[79:44] Yeah. I think the deeper philosophical
[79:46] purpose of
[79:48] Bitcoin is that at least it gives me the
[79:52] opportunity
[79:54] to live a freer life. And so despite
[79:59] everything that we said about
[80:01] government, about
[80:03] um uh external forces and powers
[80:07] actively trying to limit our freedom, um
[80:10] if I'm
[80:11] allowed to and that even if we have a
[80:15] fight for the freedom of Bitcoin and if
[80:18] I'm allowed to go where I'm treated
[80:20] best, I know that bit we don't have to
[80:24] go through using seashells and barter,
[80:26] etc.

[80:32] free in the future and it gives me hope.

[80:48] Exile. Uh, you'll either love it or hate
[80:50] it. Um I I just I I I'll eventually I
[80:54] want to do a podcast uh which is kind of
[80:56] a anti-government
[80:59] um freedombased type of um uh thing. But
[81:04] I've been very busy and I think even on
[81:06] other podcasts I said I'm the producer
