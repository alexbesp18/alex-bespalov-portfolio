[00:00] you got to admit you're stupid that's
[00:01] the hardest part for gold bugs I thought
[00:03] Bitcoin was a scam for so long it's like
[00:06] going to you know your grandad and
[00:08] asking them can you teach me how to set
[00:10] up this brand new iPhone 15 that I just
[00:12] bought why is it so important for people
[00:14] to get to one Bitcoin one Bitcoin is the
[00:17] North Star that everybody should be
[00:19] living with I'm not a happy hippie right
[00:21] I'm not sitting here going oh you're
[00:22] going to hold Bitcoin and now the trees
[00:24] are going to be hugging you back how did
[00:26] you start out that [ __ ] looks easy I'm
[00:28] not on the camp that thinks that happens
[00:30] I don't I don't see an environment
[00:32] with British hotle buy Bitcoin shut the
[00:36] [ __ ] up get fabulously wealthy you need
[00:39] to put a little bit more emphasis on the
[00:41] [ __ ] get it right shut the [ __ ] up there
[00:45] you go now we're talking this is the
[00:48] first thing I saw when I saw your ex
[00:51] profile and I just fell in love
[00:52] instantly I appreciate that I appreciate
[00:55] that which country are you in where you
[00:57] from I'm from Austria actually uh so aan
[01:00] economics is a stuff I know about but
[01:03] actually aan economics has nothing to do
[01:04] with the economics in Austria now yeah
[01:07] now it doesn't for sure no it does not
[01:10] have anything to do with it um how does
[01:13] it you were in Gold before before you
[01:15] went into Bitcoin right yeah how does a
[01:19] gold guy come from having gold
[01:23] to buying Bitcoin directly and being
[01:26] focused solely on bitcoin yeah step one
[01:29] you got to admit you're stupid um and
[01:32] that's the hardest part for gold bugs
[01:36] for me I I thought Bitcoin was a scam
[01:38] for so
[01:39] long and you know it was one day where I
[01:44] read the Bitcoin standard and I just
[01:47] realized that I was stupid um and that
[01:51] started my journey to
[01:55] basically getting on board with Bitcoin
[01:57] and pivoting my gold portfolio to bit
[02:00] coin what's the main thing the main
[02:02] property maybe of of of gold bucks that
[02:05] still don't get it um what they should
[02:08] learn about Bitcoin it's the phys I
[02:10] think it's the physicality of it I think
[02:12] every gold bug I speak to it's like
[02:14] Gold's real I can hold it in my hand and
[02:16] and I always tell them that's the that's
[02:17] the illusion that's been played on gold
[02:19] bugs because you know you've been
[02:22] convinced that gold is real because you
[02:24] can hold it in your hands without
[02:26] understanding that the the realness of
[02:29] an asset is truly the scarcity of the
[02:31] asset not the uh the the physical
[02:36] presence of it you should judge an asset
[02:38] based on its scarcity the scarcer it is
[02:40] the more real it is not the you know the
[02:43] harder it is because if that's the case
[02:45] why are you not holding steel steel is
[02:47] more physical than gold but people don't
[02:50] hold steel right yeah that's that's
[02:53] amazing I also I heard this one argument
[02:56] I think it was all also from bitter
[02:57] shift uh if few you hold gold uh or if
[03:01] you hold Bitcoin it's not scarce because
[03:03] there are 20 out of thousands of of
[03:06] altcoins so it cannot be scarce it's
[03:09] like uh that's the same thing saying
[03:11] that gold is not uh um scarce because
[03:14] there's also silver there's also copper
[03:16] there's also so many other metals
[03:19] it's any of Peter schiff's uh opinions
[03:22] at this point after this many years on
[03:23] gold especially as a big gold proponent
[03:26] especially as a huge you know pet ship's
[03:28] biggest contribution is educating people
[03:30] on how screwed the system is and I don't
[03:33] understand how someone that can educate
[03:35] people so well on how screwed the system
[03:37] is can get Bitcoin so wrong so therefore
[03:40] Peter Schiff at this point is completely
[03:42] irrelevant and I don't think needs to be
[03:44] his opinions need to be considered it's
[03:46] like going to you know uh your granddad
[03:49] and asking them can you teach me how to
[03:51] set up this brand new iPhone 15 that
[03:53] just bought right I don't even
[03:56] understand why people even consider
[03:58] Peter shi's opinion is I think it's
[04:00] strictly because of the the size of the
[04:02] following that he has um I I don't think
[04:05] there's you know any validity to it so I
[04:08] don't I I don't even speak about Peter
[04:10] Sher I don't have time
[04:12] to yeah that's uh very good um you speak
[04:17] a lot about getting to want Bitcoin aroo
[04:19] in your uh very Merry Christmas uh
[04:22] message why is it so important for
[04:25] people to get to one Bitcoin or like how
[04:27] do they how do they come there
[04:31] what what's the one Bitcoin Mark for
[04:35] you I think the one Bitcoin is the mark
[04:40] for is the North Star that everybody
[04:43] should be living with and I'm talking
[04:45] about people with up to a $10 million
[04:47] net worth because those are the people
[04:49] who are going to be priced out of one
[04:51] Bitcoin in this upcoming cycle because
[04:54] even if you've got a $10 million net
[04:55] worth you're not going to liquidate $3
[04:57] to $500,000 from that that portfolio if
[05:00] it's in real estate for example to buy
[05:03] one Bitcoin an asset that you know
[05:04] nothing about so I find my purpose on in
[05:08] you know in Bitcoin is basically helping
[05:10] people understand the urgency of
[05:11] actually owning Bitcoin and then
[05:13] focusing them on that North Star of
[05:15] getting to one Bitcoin but there's no
[05:18] real objective you know there's no real
[05:21] reason as to why it's one and only one
[05:23] etc etc but I think it's a good North
[05:25] Star to to to help people focus what
[05:29] will one Bitcoin if you zoom out like
[05:32] next 20 years what will it mean for
[05:35] someone to hold one Bitcoin what Freedom
[05:38] does it bring what does it bring to the
[05:40] the personal level if you hold one yeah
[05:42] I mean listen I'm not I'm not as you've
[05:45] probably seen in my videos right I'm not
[05:46] a happy hippie right I'm not sitting
[05:48] here going oh you're going to hold
[05:49] Bitcoin and now the trees are going to
[05:51] be hugging you back um that's not what
[05:55] that's not what I that's not what I'm
[05:56] talking about what I'm talking about is
[05:57] this if you at all in your life and in
[06:02] the life of your progeny that follows
[06:03] you want anyone to have an opinion that
[06:07] matters having one Bitcoin just like
[06:10] having a bunch of real estate just like
[06:11] owning a bunch of equities just like
[06:13] owning you know in the past a
[06:15] significant amount of gold it basically
[06:17] entitled people to an
[06:19] opinion and I don't think everyone
[06:22] deserves an opinion I I think you have
[06:23] to earn your opinion that's the that's
[06:25] the crowd that I came from those the
[06:27] mentors that I came from I don't think
[06:29] just because you're breathing means you
[06:31] deserve an opinion right I I certainly
[06:34] had to earn my opinion when I was
[06:36] starting out negotiating in the in the
[06:38] property space and and this that and the
[06:40] other in London I didn't have a an
[06:43] opinion granted to me and the mentors I
[06:45] had would would treat me as such uh
[06:49] until I earned my
[06:50] opinions and I think if anyone wants to
[06:53] solidify the future of their and their
[06:56] family's opinions I think you have to
[06:59] own one
[07:01] Bitcoin how did you start out like what
[07:03] what did your mentors teach you and what
[07:06] maybe brought you also to be open-minded
[07:08] and being there for Bitcoin when it was
[07:12] ready and also it's a big step also for
[07:16] you personally if you if you have if
[07:18] you're being a big gold guy and then go
[07:20] going to all in on bitcoin like you have
[07:24] a lot of teachings that you can so I was
[07:27] wrong and now I have no information n
[07:29] going on the Bitcoin path yeah I mean
[07:31] that's always been my that's always been
[07:33] my always been my journey because um
[07:38] when I first started I I started off
[07:40] negotiating property deals and my dad
[07:43] used my dad's was in property and I was
[07:46] watching him negotiate a deal and one
[07:48] day I I looked at him after he got off
[07:50] the phone and he said what are you
[07:51] looking at and I said that that [ __ ]
[07:53] looks easy that's exactly what I said
[07:55] that [ __ ] looks easy and you know
[07:57] instead of telling me to take a hike he
[07:59] told me well show me if it's that easy
[08:01] and I was you know approaching 16 years
[08:03] old at this point so I had to learn my
[08:06] ego got tested and I had to learn um at
[08:09] a very young age what a mortgage broker
[08:12] was what a developer was what a lawyer
[08:14] was and how to structure a deal and how
[08:17] finances work and all this other stuff
[08:19] to do that work and in those early days
[08:21] I I didn't I didn't have a granted
[08:23] opinion about anything until I proved
[08:26] you know what I could do and luckily I
[08:28] was I was pretty good at that uh at
[08:30] negotiating deals now I was the the
[08:33] luckiest part of my life was starting
[08:36] that around
[08:38] 2005 because obviously two years
[08:40] later the world stopped right in 2007
[08:45] 2008 the credit crunch first and then
[08:47] the and then the recession and what that
[08:49] taught me was that the real estate game
[08:52] was just about credit it wasn't about
[08:53] houses a lot of people get confused
[08:56] thinking that real estate is actually
[08:58] about property it's it's not real estate
[09:00] is actually about the credit surrounding
[09:02] the property market and so when I
[09:05] understood that and I learned that
[09:06] everything else became easy because now
[09:09] I realized oh it's not about real estate
[09:11] it's about the assets underlining it
[09:13] which is why that allowed me to Pivot
[09:16] nicely from you know or be open-minded
[09:18] to Pivot from Real Estate to equities to
[09:20] gold and then to bitcoin I'm I'm I
[09:23] understand that I follow the capital I
[09:25] don't I don't follow my own ideals and
[09:28] even more with Bitcoin
[09:29] you follow the capital you follow where
[09:31] the capital energy is going to go and
[09:33] and and you know the answers are are all
[09:36] in front of you you talked about in one
[09:38] of your videos in 2021 that you followed
[09:41] the capital because of Black Rock and
[09:44] they are going into Bitcoin can you talk
[09:47] about that yeah so in
[09:49] 2021 this uh no it was 20 at some point
[09:54] right end of 2020 it was the CIO of uh
[09:59] Black Rock was on CNBC and he said we
[10:02] think that Bitcoin could be gold 2.0
[10:05] this is before anyone has ever you know
[10:07] heard about Black Rock getting into an
[10:08] ETF and all this other stuff and again
[10:10] following Capital Trends is very very
[10:12] important preceding that GLD which is
[10:15] the biggest gold ETF had 17 days of
[10:21] outflows 17 days of out consistent
[10:24] outflows that's no joke right um and so
[10:28] I realized like this guy who is the
[10:30] chief investment off a chief investment
[10:33] officer of black crub just said that
[10:35] Bitcoin is gold 2.0 and now Capital was
[10:37] moving from gold so
[10:39] therefore at that point it emboldened my
[10:42] opinion about it uh because I was
[10:44] already in Bitcoin by then and that you
[10:48] know emboldened my opinion to basically
[10:50] sell my entire gold position by November
[10:52] of 2020 and pivoted into
[10:55] Bitcoin this video will come out in the
[10:58] middle of January I think I think so
[10:59] today it's the 28th of December and so
[11:03] it might be interesting to see this
[11:05] question um will the Bitcoin spotf be
[11:09] approved in January and what will happen
[11:12] once it gets approved yeah I think you
[11:14] know I'm I'm not an ETF expert right a
[11:19] legal ETF expert so I lean on uh James
[11:23] and Eric the Bloomberg analyst uh guys
[11:26] and they're putting this at a 90%
[11:28] probability that it gets approved in
[11:30] January and and that's what I lean on uh
[11:32] I think they're experts I think they're
[11:33] studying this every single day they're
[11:36] in touch the beautiful thing about
[11:38] having a Bloomberg badge is that you can
[11:39] call Black Rock and get an
[11:41] opinion um and so I have to lean on on
[11:44] their thoughts and I think there is a
[11:46] 90% probability that that will
[11:49] happen and what could happen once that
[11:52] gets approved like what what do in terms
[11:55] of price action do you mean what of
[11:57] price action marketing action event
[11:59] action salesperson actions a lot I think
[12:02] there's a lot going on once it gets
[12:04] approved it's already we starting
[12:06] already to see it but what what what
[12:09] will in a broad sense happen once
[12:12] the yeah the the securitization of an
[12:15] asset which is basically what the ETF is
[12:17] for Bitcoin basically makes the asset a
[12:21] valid asset in the eyes of Institutions
[12:23] and big investors so they'll turn around
[12:26] and they'll start marketing it there is
[12:28] an F now you won't be able to you know
[12:32] you won't have to worry about buying the
[12:33] Bitcoin going in and storing it and cold
[12:36] storage and any of this other stuff
[12:38] you'll basically be able to go in and
[12:40] buy the ETF and they'll store it for you
[12:43] uh and that in essence is a process of
[12:45] securitization of of Bitcoin when that
[12:48] happens Black Rock Bit Black Rock
[12:50] Fidelity grayscale everyone can now
[12:52] Market to the general public the ETF
[12:55] product uh in addition to having their
[12:57] advisors and every fund manager on the
[13:00] earth calling their clients up and
[13:02] saying we need to get an allocation into
[13:04] this asset that's got a 70% ker over the
[13:06] last 10 years um and that's that's what
[13:10] happen every single person that has
[13:12] Capital with black rock Fidelity
[13:15] grayscale and all of their subsidiaries
[13:18] and all of their product sales teams
[13:20] will be calling their clients and
[13:21] pitching them this new product because
[13:23] number one they make a fee on it and
[13:25] number two as the price of Bitcoin goes
[13:27] up the value of the assets and the fun
[13:29] go up and therefore the value of those
[13:30] fees go up so not only will it be the
[13:33] best performing asset that their clients
[13:35] have had it will also be the best
[13:36] performing asset that they have had
[13:38] because every four years the Val the
[13:40] dollar value of their fees are going to
[13:41] go up so the share price of those
[13:43] companies start going up because their
[13:45] fees are compounding in Bitcoin and over
[13:47] the first five years I think you could
[13:49] see a trillion dollars uh of fresh
[13:51] Capital go into Bitcoin as a result of
[13:53] the ETF now it won't be going in through
[13:56] all through the ETF but the the fact
[13:59] that you've got the marketing around the
[14:01] ETF will mean that Bitcoin uh will see I
[14:04] think a trillion dollars of inflows and
[14:06] that uh could take us to a bitcoin price
[14:09] of depending on how you you know
[14:11] understand the market of somewhere in
[14:13] the region of four to5 million a coin um
[14:15] you're talking about uh which year again
[14:19] I'm talking about within the next let's
[14:20] say five to eight
[14:22] years five to eight years yeah that's
[14:26] pretty that's pretty big I think and
[14:30] it's can actually happen I think 100K
[14:33] Cas for the January or like next year in
[14:36] in I mean shortterm short-term targets I
[14:39] already put a video out about this I
[14:40] think we get to 280k without the ETF and
[14:44] somewhere around 450,000 with the ETF in
[14:46] this next cycle that's um amazing um
[14:50] it's not actually it's actually not
[14:52] amazing um 450k would be would be an
[14:56] underperforming uh ETF marketing plan um
[15:01] because there's you know $130 trillion
[15:03] doar of capital in the world that's
[15:05] managed by the top 500 asset managers
[15:08] who are directly you know connected to
[15:12] to Black Rock and its sub subsidiaries
[15:15] so you know you could I'm talking about
[15:18] maybe a
[15:19] 0.25% allocation across that Capital
[15:22] within the first cycle um the you know
[15:25] it's an underperformance as far as I'm
[15:26] concerned at what time do we not price
[15:30] Bitcoin in US Dollars
[15:32] anymore I'm not on the camp I'm not on
[15:35] the camp that thinks that happens okay
[15:37] so like feeld will live on for yeah it
[15:41] will just be
[15:43] repurposed what do you mean we've
[15:45] repurposed like you know one day you'll
[15:47] wake up and now the US dollar is back
[15:49] 30% by Bitcoin and it becomes the
[15:51] strongest currency in the world again
[15:53] you have a 70% uh you know ability to
[15:56] fractionally lend out against it but but
[15:58] it's still the strongest currency in the
[15:59] world I I I I don't see an environment
[16:02] where there is a Bitcoin only uh world I
[16:07] may be completely wrong but I I don't
[16:09] see
[16:10] that yeah it's interesting I I think in
[16:13] the Bitcoin Community everybody agrees
[16:16] on the amazing store of value side but
[16:18] when it comes to unit of account and
[16:20] medium of exchange the um the opinion
[16:24] seems to differ a little bit um
[16:29] but when we come back to an individual
[16:32] uh and the the chances there for like
[16:35] you said no hippie what do you say happy
[16:38] hippie uh guy that is not in there for
[16:43] like Bitcoin will not solve everything
[16:46] Bitcoin will not free everything and
[16:48] just because you have Bitcoin everything
[16:50] will be perfect and i' I'm a big
[16:51] proponent of that because it's just an
[16:54] asset you own and of course maybe your
[16:57] market value your netw worth goes up a
[16:59] lot but this does not mean that
[17:01] everything is perfect now in your life
[17:03] um but when you have an inflationary
[17:06] system and then for me inflation is a
[17:09] tool to keep people uh smaller and and
[17:13] steal purchasing power what can it can
[17:16] do for like the majority of of of people
[17:20] and do you see future where everybody
[17:22] has Bitcoin as a standard savings device
[17:25] or it will be just for people that are
[17:28] know and people that are uh
[17:30] knowledgeable about stuff like that yeah
[17:32] I mean you know you're you're in Austria
[17:34] so you know the father of rustrian
[17:36] economics mises didn't even talk about
[17:38] 100% Reserve back system right they
[17:41] people think he did but he didn't
[17:43] actually uh talk about 100% Reserve Bank
[17:46] system so yeah I mean I I think Bitcoin
[17:48] allows the the normal what Bitcoin does
[17:50] is it
[17:51] democratizes savings right it
[17:54] democratizes investing and that's hugely
[17:56] important for example when I'm buying a
[17:59] bar of gold I'm buying an ounce of gold
[18:01] which means I've got a 1 to 3% premium
[18:03] that I'm paying on the price of gold to
[18:05] get that big brick a poor person that's
[18:08] trying to save you know $50 $100 a month
[18:11] into gold is paying a premium of 40 to
[18:14] 60% on that one gr bar break what that
[18:17] means is is that I need the price of
[18:19] gold to go up 1 to 3% for me to break
[18:21] even and start making money and the poor
[18:24] person needs the price of big the price
[18:26] of gold to go up 40 to 60% in order for
[18:29] them to break even and start making
[18:30] money that's the that's the biggest
[18:32] issue with gold Bitcoin doesn't have
[18:33] that issue anyone if I hand over a
[18:36] million dollars and get it converted
[18:38] into Bitcoin I'm probably going to pay
[18:40] 0.7% 0.79% whatever it is and someone
[18:44] else whose hands over $50 is probably
[18:46] going to end up paying 2.9% right so
[18:48] it's the it starts to
[18:50] democratize uh the the fee element uh on
[18:54] on bit on on savings really um and so
[18:57] that's what I think think we have and I
[18:59] think ultimately we have you know
[19:01] Bitcoin is savings and uh a a government
[19:05] issued currency to activate those
[19:07] savings into the world when you need
[19:10] to you said also that you were in in
[19:13] property and real estate you read into
[19:15] Equity so like stocks um what is how is
[19:19] Bitcoin different to all those
[19:23] uh equities and real estates uh did you
[19:26] also went into altcoin at some point did
[19:29] you have a shitcoin phase no I didn't
[19:31] have a shitcoin phase now that doesn't
[19:33] mean that I didn't buy shitcoins I
[19:35] certainly did because as an investor
[19:37] when you're coming into it you got to
[19:39] try out all these different things so
[19:41] I'm sure there's an account somewhere
[19:43] with a couple thousand dollars in in
[19:45] whatever whatever the hell but no I
[19:47] didn't have a shitcoin phase I didn't I
[19:48] never thought shitcoin was better
[19:49] shitcoins were better than Bitcoin I
[19:51] understood the true purpose of Bitcoin
[19:53] immediately as soon as it clicked uh and
[19:56] I've stuck with it since then I've never
[19:58] ever thought that something else was
[20:00] going to be better than better than
[20:01] Bitcoin or anything like that I also you
[20:04] know with my unique life experience I
[20:06] have the ability to generate liquidity
[20:08] without trading shitcoins so therefore
[20:10] I've never had the the the need or the
[20:13] desire to to do that um as far as all
[20:16] these other assets the way I look at
[20:17] assets is very simple you have to look
[20:19] at an asset like a battery uh and I
[20:21] think saor talks about this as well how
[20:24] money works is this you go out you put
[20:26] your physical labor out and that physic
[20:28] phal labor gets converted into currency
[20:30] which is what they pay you for that
[20:32] physical
[20:33] labor now that currency which is your
[20:35] energy representation of your energy
[20:37] needs to be stored inside of a
[20:39] battery and so the battery options that
[20:42] most people have are real estate
[20:43] equities and gold and so you know now
[20:47] you have Bitcoin so now if we analyze
[20:49] the the qualities of that those
[20:51] batteries of real estate for example you
[20:54] know a good quality is is that it's hard
[20:56] to build a house so there therefore the
[20:58] capacity of the battery is increasing uh
[21:01] at a very very slow pace which is good
[21:04] right then you look at equities right
[21:06] one of the one of the good things about
[21:08] about equities is that you know there's
[21:11] all these people that are trying to
[21:13] build companies and create value and all
[21:14] this other stuff so the quality of the
[21:16] battery is always refreshing it's always
[21:18] a healthy battery that's that's
[21:20] remaining uh much faster than real
[21:23] estate then you look at gold and you go
[21:25] okay well the fact that I can actually
[21:27] own some physical gold without going
[21:28] through a centralized process is of good
[21:30] quality to the to that battery too and
[21:33] then you look at the negatives right one
[21:34] of the negatives of of real estate is
[21:36] that it's geographically dependent so
[21:38] even though we're all putting our our
[21:40] energy into the same battery the quality
[21:43] of the battery dep uh differs based on
[21:46] the geographical location of your choice
[21:49] of investment which is a huge negative
[21:52] right so if the UK property Market or
[21:54] the London property Market goes to goes
[21:56] to [ __ ] I can't do anything about that
[21:59] because my energy is in that battery
[22:00] it's in the battery of real estate but
[22:02] it's now geographically dependent to
[22:04] London if for example in in equities if
[22:08] uh the companies that I'm invested in
[22:10] turn out to have a CEO that's a
[22:12] scandalous CEO I can't control that no
[22:14] matter how good quality the battery is
[22:16] that's a flaw that is available in that
[22:19] battery and with gold the fact that you
[22:21] know I can issue as a government permits
[22:24] to increase the supply of that gold
[22:26] whenever I want to that's also a
[22:28] negative feature of that battery so you
[22:30] analyze all of those things and you go
[22:32] right now we have Bitcoin Bitcoin has a
[22:34] finite Supply um you cannot regulatorily
[22:39] say Okay I want more Bitcoin so
[22:40] therefore I'm going to issue regulations
[22:42] to do that um and you know when you
[22:45] think about the negatives of of the
[22:47] Bitcoin battery so to say I would say
[22:50] that the only negative of the Bitcoin
[22:52] batter is the learning curve it takes
[22:53] from hearing about it to actually
[22:56] learning how to hold that Bitcoin
[22:57] especially if someone who's you know
[23:00] been focused on traditional assets so
[23:02] you factor all of that in and you go
[23:03] wait a second so Bitcoin is the only
[23:06] battery that doesn't
[23:07] expand right because real estate is
[23:09] always building more houses companies
[23:11] they're always having new companies and
[23:13] gold I can I can you know basically
[23:15] print more gold by issuing more permits
[23:18] to to to mine gold and and do gold
[23:20] Discovery and increase Investments and
[23:22] increase tax incentives whereas Bitcoin
[23:25] I can't do that so Bitcoin is the only
[23:27] bat where the supply lever of the asset
[23:30] is completely fixed and that's what's
[23:31] unique about it and that's what's very
[23:33] very special about it on the demand side
[23:35] it's going through an adoption curve
[23:36] which is also special so therefore
[23:39] Bitcoin is the best battery to store
[23:41] that currency and store that energy and
[23:43] that's the one that people should choose
[23:45] or choose more of will they come a time
[23:48] for you uh where Bitcoin hits a certain
[23:51] Milestone or certain price where Bitcoin
[23:53] is not the best battery
[23:56] anymore um no Bitcoin will always so
[23:59] there's assets and then there's business
[24:00] opportunities right there might be a
[24:02] time where Bitcoin is now compounding at
[24:04] a let's say a 20% Kar over the last five
[24:07] years at that point I might have other
[24:09] business opportunities where I could
[24:11] generate higher than 20% Kar but as far
[24:13] as a battery goes someone's got to find
[24:15] a battery that has the network effects
[24:17] of Bitcoin the ability to scale like
[24:19] Bitcoin and uh a supply level that's
[24:22] fixed and something else um so and that
[24:25] doesn't really come around too often you
[24:27] know how long is human it been around
[24:29] and mo mostly we have you know three or
[24:31] four battery options that's about it so
[24:33] it doesn't come around too often that
[24:35] those battery options change you got
[24:36] real estate equities gold and for the
[24:39] institutional clients more bonds uh and
[24:41] that's really it for most people what do
[24:44] you think about cbdcs how does this uh
[24:47] come into play with fat money with uh
[24:51] bitcoin's trajectory is cbtc is
[24:54] influencing anything uh about Bitcoin is
[24:58] cbdc is
[25:00] influencing um people's
[25:03] freedom yeah I mean yeah I think cbdcs
[25:06] are bad uh but do I think they're coming
[25:08] I absolutely think they're coming um I
[25:10] don't know when they're coming I think
[25:12] there will probably be a wave of cbdc
[25:14] news like what we've seen then it will
[25:16] die away and then there'll be another
[25:17] wave to make it more serious etc etc and
[25:20] I think it takes a little bit of time
[25:21] before that actually comes to pass but I
[25:23] think they are absolutely coming uh and
[25:26] I think most people will operate a
[25:28] wallet or a wealth portfolio which is
[25:31] you know on the one side you have your
[25:32] cbdc on the other side you have your
[25:34] Bitcoin uh and then you you know
[25:36] transfer between the both when you want
[25:38] to save and and
[25:39] spend so it will not change a lot for I
[25:43] think it will change a huge amount if we
[25:45] want to talk about behavioral economics
[25:47] I think that's a whole different
[25:48] discussion you know the fact that you
[25:50] can I can influence somebody's Behavior
[25:53] Uh through a cbdc is quite important but
[25:56] that's a completely different
[25:57] conversation to you know how how does it
[26:00] interact with Bitcoin you know if I want
[26:02] a populist to spend more money on a
[26:04] certain thing I can make that happen
[26:06] with a cbdc where I can't with
[26:09] cash but but will they be able to to do
[26:12] that with cbdcs Once Bitcoin is kind of
[26:16] mainstream will Bitcoin be that
[26:19] mainstream and can okay yeah no most
[26:22] people most people don't hold assets
[26:24] right most people don't hold their
[26:26] stocks no one really holds their stocks
[26:29] right most people don't hold their real
[26:31] estate they think they do but if the
[26:33] government walks in and puts a yellow
[26:34] tape around it and you breach it and get
[26:35] arrested are you really holding it I
[26:37] don't think so um gold is probably the
[26:40] one asset that people actually hold now
[26:41] Bitcoin has the benefits of everything
[26:43] else and the ability to hold it yourself
[26:45] so I think that's a huge Advantage but I
[26:47] think most people will be more
[26:48] comfortable with using a proxy product
[26:50] like uh an
[26:53] ETF that's an very interesting view um
[26:57] there the saying then like first they
[27:00] laugh at you then they first they ignore
[27:02] you then they laugh at you then they
[27:04] fight you then they join you are we with
[27:07] the Bitcoin spotf with good news coming
[27:10] out with even mainstream media now
[27:12] starting to having more and more
[27:15] positive things to say about Bitcoin it
[27:17] seems at least for me like that are we
[27:20] coming in the join you part or did did
[27:22] they give up to fight Bitcoin or did he
[27:25] even fight Bitcoin I don't think they
[27:27] have F Bitcoin the fact that black rock
[27:29] is you know CIO Black Rock was saying
[27:31] this in 2020 I think people have to
[27:33] understand that there is a difference
[27:34] between marketing uh and really hating
[27:37] something right um I think a lot of it
[27:40] was marketing I think they saw which way
[27:42] the the wind was turning and they you
[27:44] know basically had to protect their own
[27:46] position which they did and now it is
[27:48] their own position so uh they can now
[27:51] jump jump behind it so you know do I
[27:55] don't really think of it in those terms
[27:57] I know a lot of people like to think of
[27:58] it in those terms but that's just you
[28:00] know if you want to feel Vindicated go
[28:02] for it but you know I was saying in 2020
[28:05] that this is an ETF is coming this is
[28:07] going to happen etc etc so you know it's
[28:11] it's it doesn't this none of this is new
[28:13] to me it's it's it's exactly what I said
[28:16] was going to happen it's
[28:19] happening I heard about maybe like on on
[28:22] a personal note for you I heard about
[28:24] your VC funding and the story about
[28:27] pretty H uh can you talk about how did
[28:30] you start this journey on documenting
[28:33] and speaking about publicly about
[28:36] Bitcoin about uh the British hle and
[28:40] your YouTube and X Channel how did this
[28:42] start yeah so I uh I joined
[28:46] Clubhouse uh to start with during the
[28:48] during the flu season that we had
[28:50] worldwide over a couple years and you
[28:53] know I was completely Anonymous people
[28:55] didn't know who I was built an audience
[28:57] on there there then went to Twitter and
[28:59] built an audience on there and then this
[29:01] year I sort of just there's a part of me
[29:04] that was feeling bad because a lot of
[29:06] this information was out there but no
[29:09] one's really parsing it
[29:11] correctly um and I'm just sitting here
[29:14] going if people don't get to one Bitcoin
[29:16] they're going to miss this opportunity
[29:17] is you know and then they're going to
[29:19] complain about the fact that they missed
[29:21] it and I felt really bad because people
[29:24] like my parents for example who I you
[29:27] know I had to educate into owning
[29:29] Bitcoin and holding
[29:30] Bitcoin and only did it because of me
[29:34] right they they're in real estate but
[29:35] they they didn't realize that their
[29:36] property portfolio actually has to be
[29:38] worth a lot more money than it is to
[29:40] keep up with the amount of pounds that
[29:42] they that that have been
[29:43] printed and so I just felt this desire
[29:47] to actually do this uh and get the
[29:50] message out as far as the VC funding
[29:52] goes that was a joke um it was a
[29:55] self-funded tri OD that I bought and I
[29:58] said I it was a series a VC funded round
[30:02] for a $80
[30:04] tripod and the reason for this is very
[30:06] simple it's like you know right now
[30:10] there's a lot of there's a lot of
[30:11] Bitcoin YouTubers but a you know it's
[30:13] like it's like hearing the [ __ ] news
[30:16] right like everyone's just reading the
[30:17] damn news well what what I really want
[30:20] to see and it's now starting to happen
[30:22] is that people with genuine life
[30:24] experience genuine actual ability to
[30:27] parse out what's going on in the markets
[30:29] are now coming out uh and talking about
[30:32] Bitcoin and I think that's more valuable
[30:34] for for a lot of people right podcasts I
[30:36] think are extremely valuable but just
[30:39] people sitting there being paid to read
[30:41] the news to people I don't I don't I
[30:43] don't see that as valuable there's
[30:45] certain people that are doing it really
[30:46] in a really entertaining way and a
[30:48] really smart way and that's great um but
[30:52] overall I think just reading the news to
[30:55] people that already get it is is is
[30:57] valueless right my my YouTube channel is
[31:00] not for people who already get Bitcoin
[31:02] yeah people watch it because they they
[31:04] already get it and they see the value in
[31:05] it to understand what's going on but
[31:07] really I'm trying to talk to people like
[31:09] my parents who are sitting who have
[31:11] earned the right to have an opinion and
[31:13] that opinion has still been stolen from
[31:15] them that's who my YouTube channel is
[31:16] for everything else is is irrelevant to
[31:19] me I don't care whether anyone that
[31:21] already understands Bitcoin is a cipher
[31:23] Punk is this that and the other gives a
[31:25] [ __ ] likes or hates anything that I do
[31:28] as long as I keep getting messages from
[31:30] people who own traditional assets and
[31:32] they have as a result of watching
[31:34] anything I put out decided to Pivot some
[31:37] of that to bitcoin I will continue
[31:38] speaking there will be a moment where
[31:40] everything I say is completely
[31:42] irrelevant and at that point I'll just
[31:43] stop making
[31:45] videos it's a great Mission there it was
[31:48] wondering me because I just saw it
[31:50] quickly and it just came into my mind
[31:52] and uh yeah that's I I only need to I
[31:58] don't need to raise any capital I mean
[31:59] we got you know it's uh it's a it's a
[32:02] it's a it's a [ __ ] YouTube video like
[32:04] I don't need to raising in capital what
[32:06] I needed was the desire to actually do
[32:09] it you know and this is what this is
[32:11] what we need I love the fact that
[32:13] there's more younger people there's more
[32:15] older people there's people getting
[32:16] involved trying to share the message and
[32:18] the idea that this is extremely
[32:21] important that's why I put a video out
[32:22] saying if you think any of my talking
[32:24] points have any value and you can say
[32:26] them better take the talking points
[32:28] because a lot of people would message me
[32:30] say hey can I do a video on this or can
[32:31] I talk about this I'm like don't even
[32:33] ask me the message is more important
[32:35] than the messenger at this point um and
[32:38] I'm blessed you know we've got you know
[32:41] we grew from 1,800 subscribers that were
[32:43] just there from over two years to almost
[32:47] uh you know 23,000 in a space of five
[32:50] months it's it's been unbelievable and I
[32:52] and I'm also you know one of the things
[32:54] I'm happy about is that I seem to be
[32:57] able to speak to the crypto crowd as
[33:00] well as the Bitcoin crowd and that's the
[33:02] goal here is to help people understand
[33:04] what is the opportunity because I think
[33:05] Wall Street is lied I think when they
[33:07] tell you that Bitcoin is gold 2.0 it's
[33:09] because they want you to believe that
[33:11] the maximum opportunity on bitcoin is
[33:13] $500,000 and it doesn't have any value
[33:15] beyond
[33:16] that when they understand that even if
[33:18] they paid $500,000 per Bitcoin it's
[33:21] still worth many more millions of
[33:23] dollars and therefore they'll take your
[33:25] Bitcoin at that level
[33:27] so I want to try and get that message
[33:29] out try and get people to not sell their
[33:31] Bitcoin at the time that Wall Street
[33:33] wants them to sell it so that's that's
[33:35] all I'm trying to do here you know and
[33:36] it's been it's been a blessing that
[33:38] people have resonated with the message I
[33:39] keep getting messages from people who
[33:41] finally got got to their one Bitcoin
[33:44] that's what I'm doing one day I just
[33:45] will stop doing it it's a it's a it's a
[33:48] great Mission
[33:51] um what do you think about the whole
[33:54] thing with X with mainstream media with
[33:58] the more and more the shift to social
[34:00] media to podcasting to uh from
[34:03] journalists that are getting paid to
[34:06] journalists that are individual and
[34:08] independent on act
[34:11] um is is that all um good for you is it
[34:17] what's your thoughts on like e mask
[34:21] saying go [ __ ]
[34:22] yourselfers the the the I think it's
[34:25] kind of a a strength
[34:27] and um um different decision and a
[34:31] different direction we are going now
[34:33] what do you think about the I think it's
[34:35] great I think it's great and it's also
[34:37] bad because one way that you can you
[34:40] know if you're in a misinformation game
[34:42] one way to do that is to control the
[34:44] information that's coming out and the
[34:46] second way to do that is to flood it
[34:47] with so much information that the person
[34:49] gets confused and then seeks the point
[34:51] person of authority right so I think
[34:53] there's two sides to it um so far I
[34:56] think it's I think it's fine but you
[34:58] know one of the things I've noticed that
[35:00] the populace generally in the world has
[35:03] gotten stupider at parsing information
[35:06] and if you don't know how to parse
[35:07] information you don't know how to read
[35:09] between the lines you don't know how to
[35:10] do these these basic things then I don't
[35:13] care whether you're getting your
[35:14] information from the government or
[35:15] whether you're getting it from Twitter
[35:17] you're still going to be stupid right so
[35:19] I think that's really the the main
[35:21] problem that we have here is uh we
[35:23] haven't educated the populace and young
[35:25] people on how to actually parse
[35:26] information
[35:27] and find what's useful so whether it
[35:31] comes from Twitter or the government
[35:32] doesn't really matter because either way
[35:34] they'll be
[35:35] confused will this ever will this always
[35:38] be the case no there will be a point
[35:41] where governments realize that they've
[35:43] messed up and in order to stay relevant
[35:45] everyone will follow their own
[35:46] incentives and the government's
[35:47] incentive is to stay relevant is to stay
[35:50] voted in stay in power and if they find
[35:52] that the best way to do that is to help
[35:54] people realize that they need to
[35:57] get smarter better make the schools
[35:59] better etc etc that's what they'll do
[36:01] but the pain hasn't got there yet um
[36:04] Hungary is doing this right so in Europe
[36:06] hungary's realized that Europe is facing
[36:09] a demographic crisis and so what they've
[36:11] said is is that any woman that has four
[36:13] children never has to pay income taxes
[36:15] ever again and I believe it's the only
[36:17] country in Europe where the birth rate
[36:18] is actually going up so the once the
[36:22] incentives are line Humanity adapts very
[36:24] very quickly but the incentives are not
[36:26] there right now yeah it's a it's a great
[36:29] way to end it um we have an Android team
[36:32] uh in the podcast where we are having
[36:35] the previous guest asking a guest for
[36:38] the next ask a question for the next
[36:42] guest the question is an interesting one
[36:44] uh how much 100% free Bitcoin do you
[36:47] earn meaning reward programs referral
[36:50] bonuses anything like that or do you
[36:52] have any advises for people who want to
[36:54] earn free
[36:58] Bitcoin I don't I don't use uh like the
[37:02] Bitcoin um rewards programs because I
[37:06] think American Express Platinum gives me
[37:08] better rewards programs with better
[37:10] reward percentages so I don't do that I
[37:12] was talking against that in
[37:14] 2021 I don't have any recommendations to
[37:17] any uh trading platforms on my YouTube
[37:21] even though I've been offered up to
[37:22] $5,000 a video if you can believe it or
[37:25] not to do that just put a link in the in
[37:28] the description column I don't do that
[37:31] uh because they trade other [ __ ] um and
[37:33] I I would never I don't want anyone that
[37:36] is associate I would much rather promote
[37:39] a black rock Bitcoin ETF than some
[37:42] stupid exchange that's going to give me
[37:44] $5,000
[37:45] uh per video you know I would much
[37:48] rather support Fidelity or Black Rock
[37:51] etc etc because at least I know that
[37:53] anyone who's listening that their
[37:54] capital is going to be safer than one of
[37:57] these stupid
[37:58] exchanges um I I I don't really try and
[38:01] mon I haven't monetized my my reach uh
[38:05] at all so you know I don't I guess I
[38:10] don't I think that's the answer I know
[38:12] that's probably not the answer that the
[38:13] guest
[38:14] was hoping to get but I don't I I don't
[38:18] see the value in promoting [ __ ] to my
[38:20] audience that I don't use or I don't do
[38:23] my first email I actually put the emails
[38:26] out when I get them uh on my telegram so
[38:29] people can see it like as soon as I get
[38:32] an advertising offer my first question
[38:33] is are you Bitcoin only or you you trade
[38:35] other [ __ ] too and most every single one
[38:38] of them has come back with we trade
[38:40] other [ __ ] too and then the answer is
[38:42] well this is not uh this is not a fit
[38:45] um so yeah I don't I don't do
[38:49] that oh interesting that Ser you know
[38:52] this is Robin look this is this is my
[38:54] point and I said this on Twitter while
[38:56] back before I started making YouTube
[38:58] videos I can make a YouTube video
[39:01] drumming home the point of people
[39:03] getting to one Bitcoin for the next
[39:06] eight years day in day out without
[39:09] earning a single penny extra I don't
[39:13] need to earn a single penny does that
[39:15] mean I'm not going to monetize the
[39:16] audience at some point no that doesn't
[39:18] mean that but my point is this I don't
[39:20] have to take any money if I don't want
[39:22] to and that is the type of spirit of
[39:25] Bitcoin uh people that I would like to
[39:27] see more of and I think that's extremely
[39:30] important and they're coming now which
[39:32] is which is extremely great for Humanity
[39:35] in the world I don't need a single penny
[39:39] from anyone I'm
[39:41] good and I guess that's a very very
[39:43] powerful position to be in that's an
[39:46] amazing position to be in and I guess
[39:48] there are a lot of Bitcoin only
[39:50] companies also that uh would would
[39:52] happily sponsor I would listen look even
[39:55] Bitcoin only companies I I it would
[39:59] bitco a bit having a Bitcoin only
[40:01] company approach me to do any
[40:03] advertising would take them to stage
[40:06] number two and stage number two that
[40:08] that's as far as it would get them
[40:10] because at the end of the day most of
[40:12] these Bitcoin only companies are VC
[40:13] bagged by the same VCS that promote the
[40:16] shitcoins they've got burn rates of $10
[40:18] million a year while they're only making
[40:20] a million dollar a year Revenue they're
[40:22] lying to people saying we sell $500
[40:24] million a Bitcoin and not realiz not
[40:26] people don't realize that that $500
[40:29] million they only have a 1% fee which
[40:32] means their actual gross revenue is $5
[40:35] million not $500 million they're trying
[40:38] to position themselves now for an exit
[40:41] and if they don't exit which I don't
[40:43] know why they would considering
[40:44] institutional demand for Bitcoin has
[40:46] been sucked out because it's gone to
[40:48] coinbase and Retail demand is going to
[40:50] about to go straight to the ETF they'll
[40:52] be lucky if they're sold off for the
[40:55] value of the customer list nobody wants
[40:58] to take them public because it doesn't
[40:59] make any sense they're making less
[41:01] they're making more money doing
[41:03] ancillary projects than actually selling
[41:05] the Bitcoin that they have the best
[41:08] thing about Bitcoin only companies is
[41:10] the fact that they at least say get your
[41:11] Bitcoin off the exchange because I don't
[41:13] know how they survive past the next
[41:14] cycle it's a great way to to end the
[41:18] podcast um where can people find you I
[41:21] guess on a and and YouTube uh they can
