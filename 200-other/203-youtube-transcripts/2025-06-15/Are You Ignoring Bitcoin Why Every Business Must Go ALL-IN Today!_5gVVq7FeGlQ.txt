[00:00] It's not just holding Bitcoin on balance
[00:02] sheet. What we have here is a new money
[00:04] that's coming along and it's better than
[00:06] everything else. It was hard to imagine
[00:08] run the companies and how they ran 25
[00:11] years ago compared to now. The
[00:12] internet's changed so many things.
[00:14] Transferring value is even more than
[00:15] transferring information. I've been
[00:17] particularly excited about Bitcoin the
[00:18] last maybe uh 4 years or so partly
[00:22] because I felt I finally understood it
[00:25] and that can make things very exciting.
[00:27] Every company should be even only from a
[00:29] defensive point of view should be
[00:31] looking at how they do business and how
[00:34] Bitcoin can affect them in so many
[00:37] different ways. Obviously, there's a
[00:38] store value. You can put so many balance
[00:39] sheets. That should be pretty much a
[00:41] no-brainer for a lot of companies with a
[00:43] long time horizon. I think we're at the
[00:44] stage now where if you're not seriously
[00:47] at least considering Bitcoin, it's
[00:49] questionable whether you properly
[00:51] fulfilling your fiduciary duty. The true
[00:53] value is all in Bitcoin.
[00:57] [Music]
[00:59] Before we get started with all the
[01:01] topics, um maybe quickly give uh the
[01:03] viewers an overview of who you are and
[01:06] and why you're excited about uh Bitcoin.
[01:08] Yeah. So, um so Sam Roberts, I'm
[01:12] director of investment consulting at
[01:14] Cultright, a UK based uh consultancy
[01:19] adviser uh for institutions.
[01:22] And I've been particularly excited about
[01:26] maybe we can dip into some of the
[01:27] history, but uh I've been particularly
[01:30] excited about Bitcoin the last maybe uh
[01:33] four years or so. Um partly because I
[01:38] felt I finally understood
[01:40] it and that can make things very
[01:42] exciting and then you start to see how
[01:44] it can affect everything around you for
[01:47] the better. Interesting. How does uh
[01:50] what does Katride uh do currently? So we
[01:53] advise institutions
[01:56] um different types of institutions um on
[02:00] particularly on their uh investment
[02:02] strategy for their assets right so if
[02:04] they've got pool of assets so p pension
[02:06] trusts charities corporate treasuries
[02:10] um are the three key areas really
[02:12] interesting in that area I think there's
[02:14] there's a lot of uh lot even quite
[02:16] simple changes that don't include
[02:18] bitcoin um and then you include bitcoin
[02:20] and it supercharges
[02:23] Yeah. Like how did you like it's it's
[02:26] from from the traditional space if if
[02:28] you do uh anything that is with finance
[02:32] since long and you haven't discovered
[02:36] Bitcoin. I think the the jump to getting
[02:39] towards Bitcoin and discovering it is
[02:41] actually not that easy because you so so
[02:43] deep in this traditional financial
[02:45] space. How was how was that for you? Uh
[02:48] you're right. there's quite a lot of
[02:50] stuff that you need to unlearn and then
[02:52] learn it um properly, which is a real
[02:55] shame that because it means it's slowing
[02:57] so many people down um to to really
[03:00] understanding Bitcoin. For me, I suppose
[03:03] I've always been someone that's been
[03:06] inquisitive
[03:08] um not feeling I have to go along with
[03:11] the herd for the sake of it. I would
[03:14] like me to give a little bit of history
[03:16] on my journey and that might then put
[03:19] this into context rel to that. Okay. So
[03:23] my journey probably started back in
[03:26] 2008 and that was following the global
[03:29] financial
[03:30] crisis and my sort of uncomfortableness
[03:35] at that point was that this doesn't make
[03:37] sense. This contradicts the what I've
[03:41] learned in the past about how economics
[03:44] works, how finance works. Something
[03:46] isn't right. There's a this
[03:49] uncomfortable feeling, urge to um find
[03:52] the real answer, underlying answer. So
[03:55] that took me on a little bit of a
[03:57] journey which meant that I found
[03:59] Austrian economics
[04:01] um and dove deep into that. And I think
[04:02] that naturally takes a lot of people
[04:04] certainly used to a lot of people to
[04:06] gold um and sound money and the concept
[04:09] of sound money and all the benefits of
[04:12] sound money and so on. Um and so that
[04:16] was probably 2010
[04:18] 2011. I'd have probably called myself a
[04:20] gold bug back in those days. And then
[04:24] 2013 came around and Bitcoin was
[04:27] particularly I think the second half of
[04:28] that year was uh price was shooting up
[04:31] dramatically and took my notice and I'd
[04:35] heard about it a few times but I thought
[04:36] what is what is this? Um and I dabbled a
[04:39] little bit just to try and understand
[04:41] what it was. That's the way that my mind
[04:43] works. I'm not interested really in
[04:45] whether something works in theory. I'm
[04:47] more interested if something works in
[04:49] practice. And so dabbling is the way to
[04:50] do that. So, it was 2013. I didn't
[04:54] understand it. I mean, it was
[04:55] interesting. I thought, "Oh, there's
[04:57] maybe there's something there, but I
[04:58] didn't really understand it." Um, and
[05:01] parked it for a few years, focused on my
[05:03] career. Came back in, uh, 2021 really.
[05:08] Um, and then deep dived again,
[05:12] and through a couple of key things, felt
[05:15] that I understood things a lot better.
[05:17] So, one was the Bitcoin standard.
[05:19] great book, highly recommended obviously
[05:21] by lots of people quite rightly too. Um,
[05:25] but for me in particular, it was the key
[05:27] that opened the door because it brought
[05:28] together the building blocks that I
[05:30] already had deep dived into Austrian
[05:32] economics, gold, etc. and put them
[05:34] together in the context of Bitcoin. So,
[05:38] it's really for me personally, it was a
[05:39] really helpful book. The other thing
[05:41] that I did at the same sort of time was
[05:44] I said what is all this what all these
[05:47] altcoins and NFTTS and stuff like what
[05:50] what is that all about? How does it
[05:51] work? Doesn't make sense to me. So I did
[05:53] the similar sort of thing. I sort of
[05:55] dabbled a little bit in in that to see
[05:57] what does it actually mean in practice.
[06:00] And what that helped me to realize was
[06:02] that the value the true value is all in
[06:06] Bitcoin. There may be some technology
[06:10] things that come out of the rest of the
[06:12] rest of the space. Maybe good luck
[06:14] finding it but the real
[06:17] value is is is in Bitcoin and we can
[06:20] talk more about that. Uh so that was
[06:22] that was an important part. Um there
[06:25] that important period for me and so by
[06:26] the end of
[06:27] 2020 I was you know firmly said okay
[06:31] bitcoin is where the focus should be and
[06:34] then it came out to February 22 and this
[06:36] is where then it goes from being
[06:37] something personal to something uh
[06:40] business related. February 2022 Russia
[06:42] invaded Ukraine
[06:44] and Russia had $300 billion worth.
[06:47] You'll be familiar with this already,
[06:48] I'm sure, but as with your listeners,
[06:51] $300 billion worth of other government's
[06:53] bonds come frozen. And that then from an
[06:56] institutional point of view, that then
[06:59] reintroduces counterparty risk into
[07:02] government bonds. We used to in all our
[07:04] models and so on talking about
[07:06] government bonds as being risk-free. Um
[07:09] well, depends which risks you're
[07:10] concerned about, I suppose. But this
[07:13] this was um it it was a big moment, I
[07:16] think. I'm not sure how many people
[07:17] actually realized it um outside of the
[07:20] Bitcoin world but uh it was a big moment
[07:23] I thought and
[07:25] therefore you're then moving the world
[07:28] is then moving to assets which now is
[07:30] talked about quite regularly but it
[07:31] wasn't really 3 years ago how
[07:35] governments and companies and
[07:38] organizations need to move to assets
[07:40] which don't have that counterparty risk.
[07:42] So, gold and Bitcoin being the obvious
[07:45] uh options
[07:47] there. Um anyway, I'll pause there for a
[07:49] moment. Yeah, it's super interesting the
[07:52] institutional money um really coming
[07:55] into Bitcoin now. The institutional kind
[07:58] of wave of seeing, hey, this this asset
[08:01] is not just something that nerds like to
[08:03] speculate with like uh cy cyber nerds,
[08:07] but also like Austrian economic nerds or
[08:09] gold bucks. uh it's it's actually
[08:12] something really valuable and I guess
[08:14] Micro Strategy kind of started that
[08:17] whole thing uh of institutional buying
[08:19] for for Bitcoin. was the first first
[08:21] publicly traded company and then
[08:23] afterwards um more and more pe more and
[08:26] more companies came but honestly it's
[08:27] it's even a little slower than I expect
[08:31] that those institutions have a lot of
[08:33] processes and uh runway of saying hey we
[08:37] need to do do speak with this person and
[08:39] this person and there might be actually
[08:41] CFO out there that really likes Bitcoin
[08:45] but he is afraid that if he now goes all
[08:48] in Bitcoin also with the company he
[08:49] might lose his job like because maybe
[08:51] all around him people uh don't get
[08:54] Bitcoin yet. So there's a really
[08:56] interesting dynamics going on with
[08:58] institutional money and in in connection
[09:01] with with Bitcoin these days. And I feel
[09:04] like that that career risk might flip a
[09:07] little bit in the other direction where
[09:09] we are still still now in the in the the
[09:12] phase where it's a little bit risky and
[09:14] and people are a little bit afraid of
[09:16] that. Um, but at some point it will be
[09:18] risky not to have a to not have a
[09:21] Bitcoin strategy. How do you look at how
[09:23] do you look at that? Oh, I think you're
[09:25] spot on. I think
[09:27] where both those key points. So one is
[09:30] um career risk. It holds people back
[09:34] which is a real shame and but also at
[09:36] some point that will that will flip
[09:39] um and it will be a career not to have
[09:42] seriously considered it. And I think
[09:44] that will be um and you mentioned um
[09:47] essentially Bitcoin treasury companies
[09:48] there. Um it's it's not just it's not
[09:51] just holding Bitcoin on balance sheet.
[09:54] It's we we have what we have here is a
[10:00] um a new money that's coming along and
[10:02] it's better than everything else.
[10:05] And now all that sort of salability
[10:07] across time which is the store value but
[10:10] also salability across space and how
[10:14] does that then integrate itself to each
[10:18] company which each company does things
[10:21] in a different way obviously got tons of
[10:23] different industes industries it's going
[10:24] to affect some more than others but this
[10:27] is this is big this is huge uh and one
[10:31] the best analogy I can think of which
[10:33] even in itself isn't enough is the
[10:35] internet. And 25 years ago, possibly 30
[10:39] years ago, when uh people were starting
[10:42] to talk about the internet and the
[10:43] adoption rate was, you know, sharply
[10:45] moving up, but still from a very very
[10:47] low
[10:49] base, we can't even it was hard to
[10:51] imagine run the companies and how they
[10:54] ran 25 years ago compared to now. The
[10:56] internet has changed so many
[10:58] things
[11:00] and money is even bigger
[11:04] than transferring values even more than
[11:06] transferring information. Let's say it's
[11:08] even more impactful and influential. And
[11:11] so every company should be even only
[11:14] from a defensive point of view should be
[11:16] looking at how they do business and how
[11:20] Bitcoin can affect them in so many
[11:23] different ways.
[11:24] Um, so obviously there obviously there's
[11:27] a store value. You can put so many
[11:29] balance sheets. That's that's that
[11:30] should be pretty much a no-brainer for a
[11:32] lot of companies with a long time
[11:34] horizon. But then you've got okay, how
[11:36] you going to accept Bitcoin? Are you if
[11:39] you're a retailer, for example, then
[11:42] you've got that um you got the
[11:45] shopfront, you're taking money from from
[11:47] individuals, customers. How do you do
[11:50] that? How do you do that more
[11:51] effectively? How do you stand out from
[11:53] the crowd? Um, what do you then do with
[11:55] the Bitcoin when it comes in? How do you
[11:58] um how do you pay your staff? At the
[12:02] moment, it will be in the local
[12:03] currency, I suspect, but how do you
[12:06] transition that towards towards Bitcoin?
[12:08] Are there other things in the company
[12:10] that happen? The way that you maybe
[12:12] incentivize staff in other ways that
[12:14] actually incorporating Bitcoin could
[12:16] make a huge difference and really uh
[12:18] supercharge your business as we move
[12:21] over I mean who knows how long it's
[12:23] going to take let's say 20 years to move
[12:25] from a substantially fiat economy to a
[12:29] substantially Bitcoin economy.
[12:32] Um there's a going to be a lot to think
[12:34] about and a lot of processes within
[12:36] companies and organizations are going to
[12:38] need to change. I 100% agree and I also
[12:41] like the point that you made there. I
[12:44] mean you the that money is such a big
[12:46] market and and I think that's a that's
[12:49] what a lot of people kind of miss and
[12:51] they they say oh like we even with
[12:55] altcoins even if if there's as you said
[12:57] there there might be some technical
[12:59] interesting thing going on I don't think
[13:00] so but maybe just say like let's say
[13:03] there is something even if there's merit
[13:06] to an alcoin it might actually have
[13:09] utility if that's the case the
[13:12] opportunity of that altcoin uh might be
[13:17] um like what what what can it be like a
[13:20] few few hundred million maybe a billion
[13:23] or like whatever the the the opportunity
[13:25] of of that market of of that one project
[13:27] is because there also competitions
[13:29] coming to that and and those things um
[13:32] for Bitcoin it's what that 400 trillion
[13:35] 500 trillion whatever the the the money
[13:38] uh market the money opportunity is
[13:41] whatever the number is I also heard like
[13:43] 800 trillion, 900 trillion. Uh I guess
[13:45] every year this this number will
[13:47] slightly grow depending on how much we
[13:50] how much we um uh uh print. So even if
[13:56] you see like oh there might be some
[13:57] other projects you're like but this is
[13:59] the real thing like bit Bitcoin is the
[14:02] the the actual paradigm shift the the
[14:04] actual game changer in in in this
[14:07] generation in this civilization that we
[14:09] are currently in like why use any brain
[14:12] cells for something else currently is
[14:15] what I thinking about yeah the market is
[14:18] so huge for money as you say and not
[14:21] only yeah maybe there Maybe someone can
[14:24] find some a particular thing in an old
[14:26] coin that is a oh that's a neat piece of
[14:29] technology, but one it's probably going
[14:31] to get diluted because the supply of
[14:33] that old coin is is probably infinite.
[14:36] Uh and secondly, someone else can just
[14:38] take that idea and it could be built on
[14:40] Bitcoin or it could be built in some
[14:41] other way. There's no moat particularly
[14:44] around that altcoin. So you've got two
[14:47] huge problems and from an institution
[14:50] point of view we want to buy assets
[14:55] strategically. So you might have a
[14:57] little bit of rebalancing and so on
[14:59] around you know operating the portfolio
[15:01] but essentially you're often looking for
[15:03] what can I do for the next 10 years?
[15:05] What's my plan? What what strategic
[15:08] allocations
[15:09] uh make sense to me given the objectives
[15:12] we've got etc. And
[15:15] so if you know if you look across and we
[15:18] call them the the uh regulator over here
[15:22] in the UK likes to talk describe them as
[15:24] crypto assets. If you look across you've
[15:27] got Bitcoin, you've got everything else
[15:30] and hand on heart the everything else.
[15:34] Can I be confident they'll be around in
[15:36] 10 years? Nope. Can I be confident that
[15:39] Bitcoin is around in 10 years? Yes,
[15:41] absolutely. So, um there's a big
[15:44] difference. Um and I find it I find it
[15:49] difficult I would find it incredibly
[15:50] difficult to um um to advise clients to
[15:54] use the the the altcoins and and and go
[15:56] into there because you just it's just uh
[15:59] much more
[16:00] um fluid for one of a better word. Um
[16:05] where where institutions need to be a
[16:07] lot more strategic. I think when you
[16:09] combine that with a lot of institutions
[16:12] are quite rightly thinking about the
[16:15] effect that their company has on their
[16:17] staff and on the world wanting to do the
[16:20] right things from an environmental and a
[16:22] social point of
[16:24] view. Well, having a sound money
[16:29] ticks so many if not all of those boxes.
[16:32] Um, yes, not all of it may be happening.
[16:35] It takes time for it to happen. But
[16:37] having a sound money enables and gives
[16:41] primarily because it gives people longer
[16:42] time horizons um or low time preference.
[16:46] Um
[16:48] so that is a very strong reason why
[16:50] institutions should focus on Bitcoin and
[16:54] that's why you also played a crucial a
[16:58] crucial role in getting Bitcoin into UK
[17:02] pension funds if if I understand in the
[17:04] if I understood that correctly. Yes. So,
[17:07] so the way that we looked at it was that
[17:10] we because we advise across all types of
[17:13] assets. Um, and each of our clients has
[17:16] got different objectives and we need
[17:20] to a key starting point is saying, okay,
[17:23] you've got certain objectives, we
[17:24] figured out what they are. We've got
[17:25] this range of assets that you could use
[17:29] in some way to achieve those objectives.
[17:31] Let's work through the list and see
[17:33] which ones are relevant and which ones
[17:35] aren't. So from a Bitcoin point of view,
[17:38] what we did is we added all we did was
[17:40] we added Bitcoin to that list of
[17:44] assets. And when you start then applying
[17:48] it to the same analysis that trustes of
[17:52] pension schemes have been doing for for
[17:54] years and years and years, it's going to
[17:55] be relevant for some, not for others.
[17:57] And a key filter is what's their time
[18:00] horizon.
[18:02] Um, and some pension schemes over here,
[18:04] they're looking to pass the entire
[18:06] pension scheme over to insurer pretty
[18:08] damn quick, you know, maybe within the
[18:10] next year or two, three years, in which
[18:13] case
[18:15] uh, from I mean, we're expecting Bitcoin
[18:18] who who knows, but we're expecting
[18:20] Bitcoin to be short-term, very volatile,
[18:22] long-term to have huge potential. That's
[18:25] the the the the headline, I suppose. If
[18:28] you've only got two or three years,
[18:29] you've no idea whether Bitcoin's going
[18:31] to be up, down,
[18:33] sideways, where you be a lot more
[18:34] confident the further out you go. Um,
[18:38] and so this particular pension scheme
[18:40] has got a 10-year time
[18:42] horizon. Um, so that's comfort, you
[18:44] know, well, probably four or five is is
[18:46] probably a threshold where it starts to
[18:48] make sense uh as a small allocation
[18:51] within a portfolio.
[18:54] Yeah, it's it's like if you're in
[18:57] Bitcoin under four years, you you you
[19:01] can also not be in Bitcoin. Like it's
[19:03] it's like under four years if that's
[19:06] your time horizon. It's it's it's kind
[19:07] of hard to to be in this asset. You
[19:10] probably are good. Like you probably
[19:13] make money even if you're under four
[19:15] years in Bitcoin. And you probably
[19:17] should still do it because uh chances
[19:19] are if you get into Bitcoin all of a
[19:21] sudden you get educated and probably you
[19:22] stay longer than 4 years. Uh that's why
[19:25] I always say to individual people they
[19:26] say like oh like maybe I I only want to
[19:29] have a few years in Bitcoin like oh go
[19:30] ahead and do it. I I think you will stay
[19:32] longer if you get educated. Uh because
[19:36] this one thing that I I see constantly
[19:39] with individuals once they tip the dose
[19:41] in and they're like oh like I have a
[19:43] little bit of Bitcoin. all of the sudden
[19:44] they're paying attention a little bit
[19:45] more and they're getting educated.
[19:47] They're buying Bitcoin books and all of
[19:48] the sudden they they really transform.
[19:50] But the realistic time frame on Bitcoin
[19:54] is 10 years, 100 years, forever. that
[19:57] that's kind of my uh and it's super
[20:00] funny because I in Austria we have a
[20:04] pension fund that you cannot really
[20:06] choose like you have free options but
[20:08] you cannot choose outside of those free
[20:10] options and none of those options
[20:11] include any bitcoin and so I just said
[20:15] okay this money that goes to those
[20:17] pension funds I never see again if I see
[20:19] it again I'm I'm happy but I I just like
[20:22] write it off as a special kind of tax
[20:25] and Um, I focus on my Bitcoin and and
[20:29] Bitcoin directly like 100% is is is my
[20:32] pension fund. And I'm I'm I'm astonished
[20:36] how little Bitcoin plays currently a
[20:39] role in in pension funds even as a small
[20:42] diversifier. like they they they can put
[20:45] like 0.5% in in in Bitcoin and it might
[20:49] make like that 0.5 Bitcoin might make um
[20:53] an a difference if this goes crazy up in
[20:57] the next uh 5 to 10 years. But if it
[21:00] goes to zero, it's also not that bad.
[21:03] It's just 0.5%. you know, like the this
[21:05] is a I think Black Rockck called it a
[21:08] unique diversifier with really unique
[21:10] properties uh for an asset allocation
[21:13] standpoint. Even if you're not a Bitcoin
[21:16] maxi like myself, I think a small
[21:19] Bitcoin allocation uh from from a
[21:22] portfolio allocation standpoint makes
[21:24] makes sense for for for people. How how
[21:26] do you look at the allocation and and
[21:28] and why so so so few of them actually
[21:31] understand that? Yeah, I think you're
[21:33] right. um in principle on that. So um I
[21:37] think there's a big difference well
[21:39] there can be a big difference between
[21:41] individuals and what they do with their
[21:42] own money and institutions. And one of
[21:46] the things with individuals is that uh
[21:49] we've got normally our time horizon is
[21:52] decades unless we've you know we're
[21:53] we're a certain age or we've had some
[21:55] bad news. We we've got a long time
[21:57] horizon, right? So we're we're looking
[21:59] decades ahead in which case that's what
[22:01] we're that's what we're focused on. Um
[22:04] institutions there's a lot of
[22:07] different flavors or objectives um that
[22:10] different institutions have. So some
[22:12] have really short time horizons. You
[22:14] know they almost literally they've got
[22:16] they got £100 they need to pay out £100
[22:19] in a year's time. um they don't have the
[22:23] flexibility the capacity to to to have
[22:26] lots of uh volatility within that um and
[22:29] also a lot of
[22:30] institutions they're taking in in the UK
[22:34] anyway taking in
[22:35] pounds sterling and they're paying out
[22:37] pound sterling and maybe that pound
[22:39] sterling is sort of fixed so they're
[22:41] aiming to have you know they need to pay
[22:43] out £1,000 per year to a particular
[22:46] person that might be the the sort of
[22:49] contractually effectively what is
[22:51] happening with that particular pension
[22:52] scheme. In which case
[22:56] they there's effectively a limit on how
[22:59] much money they need in the scheme in
[23:01] the pension scheme to be able to pay
[23:03] that
[23:03] £1,000 a year to that particular person.
[23:07] Once they got enough, they got enough.
[23:09] They don't need to take
[23:11] um infinite amounts of uh risk. They
[23:14] don't need infinite amounts of return.
[23:17] So that's there I'm describing defined
[23:19] benefit pension schemes which is uh
[23:22] we've got 5,000 of them in the UK.
[23:24] There's some other there's a select
[23:26] number of other countries around the
[23:28] world uh Netherlands uh Ireland some in
[23:31] the US uh that have these but most
[23:33] countries have what we call defined
[23:35] contribution or money purchase and
[23:38] that's
[23:39] where the employer the employee similar
[23:41] to what you've got although yours sounds
[23:43] like a state operated enterprise. So you
[23:46] employee and employer put in some money
[23:49] and then whatever it buys at the end in
[23:52] you know whenever you retire that's what
[23:54] you get. It's whatever it is. Um there's
[23:57] no promise or guarantee made in terms of
[24:00] what the purchasing power would be or
[24:03] what it would be able to buy um or in
[24:06] terms of fiat currency amounts or
[24:08] anything like that. So they're two very
[24:11] different types of pension scheme
[24:13] operate in um in very different ways. Um
[24:17] and so it's critical that whoever's in
[24:22] charge of that pool of assets is
[24:25] thinking very carefully through whether
[24:26] they can justify uh that not only
[24:30] Bitcoin allocation but an equity
[24:32] allocation or some other kind of a
[24:34] volatile asset. Um and then it's a case
[24:37] of putting them together so that they
[24:41] uh they get the right overall balance of
[24:44] risks. And that's one of the beauties of
[24:47] of Bitcoin is because as soon as you
[24:49] start adding it to portfolios, even at
[24:51] only small amounts of so this pension
[24:53] scheme in October was 3% of the assets.
[24:57] Um but you know if it's 2 3 4% of of the
[25:00] of any portfolio like this, it's going
[25:03] to be
[25:07] posit but the expected return the
[25:10] potential the growth potential is much
[25:12] higher. And so that's the trade-off that
[25:15] you that institutions should be looking
[25:17] at. What how much could I gain versus
[25:20] how much could I lose? Um and what we
[25:24] did as well for this pension scheme was
[25:26] we put it in the context of their
[25:28] specific objectives. So ideally they
[25:31] want to be able to get to a position
[25:34] where they get hand everything over to
[25:35] an
[25:35] insurer may and maybe that'll take 10
[25:38] years. And the analysis we did which I'd
[25:42] encourage every pension scheme in the
[25:43] land to to do something like this um
[25:47] which is say okay if we put 3% Bitcoin
[25:50] allocation in and it immediately forces
[25:53] this is worst case scenario immediately
[25:54] forces zero never recovers what's the
[25:57] impact on the overall objective well
[26:00] before you expect it to get to your
[26:02] objective in 10 years now we rerun the
[26:05] analysis you expect to get there in 10
[26:06] years 3 months so It's obviously worse
[26:09] because you've just lost some assets,
[26:11] but it's not that bad. It's not that
[26:13] material um in the big scheme of things.
[26:16] And then we looked at the other scenario
[26:18] which isn't which you know which I think
[26:20] we looked at the last 5 years which was
[26:22] 40 50% returns and if they applied for
[26:25] the next um 5 10 years what's the impact
[26:29] on you over objective and that brought
[26:31] the 10 years down to eight years. Right?
[26:33] So you got 10 years to three 10 years 3
[26:34] months 10 years to 8 years. And so what
[26:38] that highlights really well is the
[26:40] asymmetry of uh of returns um that that
[26:45] could come through and why it makes
[26:47] sense to have a little bit of Bitcoin if
[26:49] you've got a long-term portfolio. That's
[26:52] super interesting because it it can make
[26:54] a a huge difference even like a small
[26:57] allocation the symmetry of it makes a
[26:59] lot of sense. What what what is what
[27:02] would you say is the current state of of
[27:05] like pension funds and and those in big
[27:07] individ in institutional players um of
[27:11] understanding Bitcoin or thinking about
[27:14] adding Bitcoin uh to portfolio to
[27:17] balance sheet uh and and how many uh do
[27:20] you think will maybe go ahead with some
[27:23] Bitcoin strategy in the next like 5 10
[27:25] 15 years? Well, I mean, I think 5 10 15
[27:28] years a lot will be forced to to think
[27:32] about
[27:33] it. Um, it's one of those if Bitcoin
[27:36] survives, which I expect it to be, but
[27:38] obviously depends on it. You know, as uh
[27:41] Jeff Booth frequently says, if it
[27:42] remains decentralized and secure, so if
[27:45] it survives, then it's going to force
[27:48] people to to to look at it over that
[27:51] kind of period of time. If we look at
[27:53] shorter periods say over the over the
[27:55] next year then I think it's going to
[27:58] come down to that career risk point. So
[28:02] the level of knowledge in the
[28:05] industry is I it's very different
[28:08] between different people but you've got
[28:11] some people who maybe for whatever
[28:13] reason maybe it's their personality
[28:15] maybe it's because they got to a certain
[28:16] point in their career they don't feel
[28:18] the career risk as much as they maybe
[28:20] used to. They're more open-minded.
[28:24] They're willing to say okay it's not
[28:27] dead yet. Maybe there is something in
[28:29] it. uh it doesn't mean they're
[28:30] necessarily buying it for their clients,
[28:32] but it means that they open their mind
[28:34] and they uh explore it
[28:36] further. We then have a a big a large
[28:40] number of people who are either um uh
[28:45] they've got a little bit of knowledge,
[28:46] you know, they say about a little bit of
[28:48] knowledge can be a dangerous thing
[28:50] because the little bit of knowledge that
[28:51] they might have is based on newspaper
[28:53] headlines from 10 years ago. you know,
[28:56] it's going to destroy the planet and all
[28:57] this this nonsense. Um, it's quite
[29:01] difficult them particularly if they're
[29:02] busy in their day job or they have that
[29:04] career risk because they're just there's
[29:08] no incentive for them to to explore it
[29:10] further. Um, and that's a real shame and
[29:12] I think it's a shame for them, it's a
[29:15] shame for their clients. I mean arguably
[29:18] arguably and this is why we sort of
[29:20] talked about in terms of just putting
[29:21] Bitcoin on the asset list and then we we
[29:23] explore it in the same way explore
[29:24] everything else every other asset. I
[29:26] think we're at the stage now where if
[29:30] someone is whether it's a trustee or a
[29:33] treasurer or or a charity
[29:36] trustee if they're looking after someone
[29:38] else's
[29:39] money we talk a lot in our industry
[29:42] about a fiduciary duty. What are the
[29:44] what are what are trustees or other
[29:46] institutions what are they required to
[29:48] do to make sure that they are
[29:51] appropriately looking after someone
[29:52] else's money. I think we're at the stage
[29:54] now where it's if you're not seriously
[29:58] at least considering
[30:00] Bitcoin doesn't mean you have to buy it.
[30:02] If you're not considering it it's
[30:04] questionable whether you are ful
[30:06] properly fulfilling your fiduciary duty.
[30:09] Let's take a break for a moment and
[30:11] appreciate the beauty that Coin
[30:13] Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[30:16] watches. Those watches are the most
[30:18] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[30:21] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[30:25] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[30:27] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[30:31] watch collections. You have the date of
[30:33] the first ever mined Bitcoin block in
[30:36] there and of course also the block
[30:38] height and which epoch we are currently
[30:41] in. I love the level of detail they put
[30:44] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[30:47] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[30:50] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[30:52] love those watches so so much. And now
[30:55] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[30:58] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[31:00] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[31:02] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[31:04] first way is you put it on a hardware
[31:06] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[31:09] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[31:12] Bitbox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[31:16] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[31:18] if you check out the link in the
[31:20] description, you even get 5% off if you
[31:23] use the code Robin. And the second way
[31:25] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[31:29] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[31:32] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[31:35] They will personalize for you a
[31:37] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[31:40] your individual situation. They will
[31:43] show you how you can secure your own
[31:45] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[31:48] enough. You also have to keep all your
[31:50] devices secure. One topic that is
[31:52] overlooked often is the inheritance
[31:54] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[31:57] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[32:00] a plan for that in place already? And
[32:02] last but not least, if you're in a
[32:04] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[32:07] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[32:09] that, head over to the
[32:13] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[32:16] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[32:19] be for the first time ever speaking at
[32:21] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[32:24] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[32:26] really looking forward to seeing all of
[32:28] you there. You can get your ticket in
[32:31] the link down in the description of
[32:33] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[32:35] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[32:39] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[32:41] there. It's a good point of of because
[32:43] if I ask someone else to take care of my
[32:47] money, uh then then I want him to
[32:50] consider all options and then he should
[32:53] have a good answer why he didn't do the
[32:55] Bitcoin strategy and Bitcoin is now I
[32:58] guess because like there's always
[33:00] argument oh like a person cannot look at
[33:02] all assets like there's too many assets
[33:04] in in the world but Bitcoin is at that
[33:07] point where it's too big to ignore.
[33:11] So what we are now bigger than silver
[33:14] and we are on like I don't know like top
[33:16] six assets in in in in the world. Uh
[33:18] some companies gold and and and some
[33:21] things that are still in front of
[33:22] Bitcoin but it's
[33:24] just do you you cannot dismiss Bitcoin
[33:28] like you could dismiss it like 5 years
[33:30] ago. 5 years ago you could say like oh
[33:33] may like this might go away. It's is
[33:36] like some random internet thing like
[33:39] 2019 maybe. But now with Black Rockck
[33:42] big institutional money uh now with with
[33:45] Coinbase in in in the S&P 500 with Tesla
[33:49] in the S&P 500 which also holds Bitcoin.
[33:51] I I think strategy might uh soon be in
[33:54] the S&P 500. We literally have the US
[33:57] president talking about Bitcoin. It's
[33:59] now at the point where you can't ignore
[34:02] it anymore. So you have to consider it
[34:05] and if you don't consider it do do you
[34:08] really fulfill your duty to at least
[34:12] give it a fair shot and then you might
[34:16] look uh also you might have a career
[34:20] risk and I we literally talked about
[34:22] that uh in two episodes before that. Um
[34:26] there's this career risk right now of
[34:29] when you are now aggressively in Bitcoin
[34:32] uh as a CFO of a company, you might say
[34:36] like, "Oh when Bitcoin now goes
[34:38] down for a year because like 2096 maybe
[34:40] is a down year and then your company has
[34:43] to report losses or whatever." uh you
[34:46] might be in a little bit of a uh you
[34:49] have to explain yourself and you have to
[34:50] defend Bitcoin and if they're not
[34:52] Bitcoiners maybe you lose your job and
[34:53] and those kind of risks but if you are a
[34:58] Bitcoiner as a CFO right now and you
[35:02] really believe in that and you have so
[35:05] much fear uh to come out of that and and
[35:08] you don't do that with the company if
[35:10] you now get rich from Bitcoin in the
[35:12] next 5 years and the company is saying
[35:14] to you oh you got it privately 5 years
[35:17] ago like why did you never pursue that
[35:20] uh on the company level why did you not
[35:23] bring out Bitcoin for us and the company
[35:26] is like hey you you knew about Bitcoin
[35:30] you did it privately but as a CFO on our
[35:33] company side you did not even bring it
[35:35] forward as an idea or you did not really
[35:37] pursue it so there's this uh different
[35:40] career risk uh of of now already
[35:45] starting that in the future they might
[35:47] look back at at the CFO and it's like oh
[35:50] it was obvious like 205 even the
[35:52] president was talking about it why why
[35:54] why haven't you not done anything with
[35:56] Bitcoin like at least like a small
[35:58] position like 0.5% cannot hurt right so
[36:00] that's that's an interesting uh
[36:03] perspective in the future yeah and I
[36:05] think um yeah that's made me think of a
[36:07] few things there actually so uh one was
[36:10] that um I do have I do have a lot of
[36:13] sympathy
[36:14] for trustees or you know treasurers,
[36:17] finance directors that are coming coming
[36:19] at this and the first thing that
[36:22] Coinbase is obviously um an example of
[36:24] that of an exchange there's lots of
[36:27] others but that's sort of uh very you
[36:31] know people see that very quickly and
[36:33] they look at that and say well but
[36:34] there's I don't I don't even know how
[36:36] many coins there are now but let's say
[36:37] there's there's I don't know 100,000 or
[36:40] something
[36:42] um they look How am I meant to
[36:44] distinguish between the 100,000 and
[36:47] therefore it's too complicated. Let's
[36:48] park it. Um where I think so that's why
[36:52] I think um distinguishing early on
[36:56] between Bitcoin and everything else is
[36:58] so critical because not only is it which
[37:02] one can you um you know be confident
[37:05] will be around in 10 years. It's not
[37:07] just that. It's it's also
[37:11] um the way in which you allocate it
[37:14] within a portfolio. So if you are if
[37:18] you've got um a cash fe fi currency cash
[37:24] allocation a traditional way to try and
[37:26] protect against some of the debasement
[37:28] would be to have a bit of gold. Um so
[37:30] maybe there's a bit of that there.
[37:32] Bitcoin naturally fits into that uh into
[37:36] that allocation in some shape or form.
[37:38] So that's the way that that sort of cash
[37:41] allocation should be should be thought
[37:43] about over here in a completely
[37:45] different part of the portfolio. Maybe
[37:47] there's a technology um allocation
[37:51] um exposure in which case I think you
[37:55] could legitimately say okay if we are
[37:58] going to consider crypto in general not
[38:02] Bitcoin
[38:03] crypto then that's the context in which
[38:06] we could do it and then you should be
[38:08] comparing as an institutional investor
[38:11] comparing crypto
[38:13] against technology companies that you
[38:16] know your Googles, your Microsofts and
[38:17] so on. It bends those companies against
[38:21] a footsie technology index or you know
[38:25] those kind of companies. Um and I think
[38:28] very quickly from an institution point
[38:30] of view, you look at that and you'll say
[38:33] I've got these companies over here that
[38:34] are listed on the stock exchange. They
[38:36] disclose huge amounts of information in
[38:38] terms of what they're doing, why they're
[38:40] doing it. They're not all going to
[38:41] survive. No, they're taking risks,
[38:44] company risks.
[38:46] Um, but at least I can understand and
[38:49] get information on what they're doing.
[38:50] And then over here I've got crypto where
[38:52] it's a lot of work to try and work out
[38:54] where the where any benefit could be,
[38:57] where any value is. And even then, not
[38:59] so sure. So I imagine through that
[39:02] analysis, we end up with people saying,
[39:05] okay, my technology allocation, I'm just
[39:07] going to buy a fund which buys listed
[39:11] stocks. my money allocation, I'm going
[39:14] to have some kind of split between my my
[39:17] fiat currency, gold, and Bitcoin. And
[39:19] that so that makes that makes a big um I
[39:21] think a big difference. And I think one
[39:23] of the things that helped there, you
[39:24] mentioned it actually, was Trump's
[39:26] executive order on the strategic Bitcoin
[39:28] reserve and the crypto um
[39:31] stockpile distinguish between the two.
[39:34] Um so separated, but also we're going to
[39:37] try and buy some Bitcoin. We're not
[39:38] going to sell any. we're gonna look to
[39:41] manage or sell and certainly not buy any
[39:44] any crypto. So, um I think that was very
[39:47] helpful. So, um the another point I
[39:50] thought of was from a corporate treasury
[39:52] point of view for many years. Well, the
[39:54] last 40 years really we've had reducing
[39:57] interest rates in the market. Um we've
[39:59] had some points at which inflation has
[40:01] flared up. Um but generally speaking,
[40:04] inflation has been coming down or it's
[40:05] been fairly low. So, you know, if you
[40:07] look over the 90s, the 2000s,
[40:11] um, and so from a corporate treasury
[40:14] point of view, if the focus is on
[40:17] increasing the nominal value of the
[40:20] corporate treasury and therefore being
[40:24] ready at a moment's notice to support
[40:27] the business in the way that the
[40:30] business decides it needs to be
[40:31] supported, that was, I think, a
[40:33] legitimate way to to a simplified
[40:35] version, but legitimate way to look at
[40:37] managing that corporate treasury. The
[40:40] problem we have now, why that model
[40:42] doesn't work anymore is because we're
[40:43] now in in an inflationary environment,
[40:46] not a um well, a low inflation
[40:49] environment which we have been
[40:50] previously. And so the problem there is
[40:54] that even if you're increasing the value
[40:56] of that corporate treasury in nominal
[40:59] terms, you're not increasing it in real
[41:01] terms. And there could be sudden spikes
[41:04] in inflation which means suddenly the
[41:06] value the real value of of that
[41:09] corporate treasury you know could drop
[41:10] you know 10% or 20% over a year or two.
[41:14] That could have really big implications
[41:16] for being able to support the business
[41:18] because the business itself is going to
[41:20] need to employ real people. It's going
[41:22] to need to buy real resources and
[41:25] they're going to cost according to
[41:28] whatever you know is happening in the
[41:30] economy. If those prices have shot up
[41:32] that corporate treasury is then a drag
[41:34] on the business, a cash drag if you like
[41:36] rather than supporting and um supporting
[41:39] that business. So I think that's a I
[41:42] think that's should be increasingly
[41:44] talked about um topic uh and the natural
[41:48] things to do. It's quite difficult for
[41:52] um corporate treasuries to buy some of
[41:55] the sort of the weird and the wacky uh
[41:57] investments that other institutional
[41:58] investors can do. But that's fine. They
[42:01] don't need to, you know, for a lot of
[42:02] time they'll have maybe a really pretty
[42:05] large allocation to um to the local fi
[42:09] currency, a little bit of interest on
[42:10] that just to hopefully not lose too much
[42:13] ground. And then at the other end of the
[42:15] portfolio, they could have a little bit
[42:16] of Bitcoin to uh and then you don't need
[42:19] huge amount to have a really big impact.
[42:21] So that barbell type of approach. So
[42:23] that might be something that we see
[42:25] coming through for a lot of companies as
[42:26] a as a starting point. companies don't
[42:29] have to do what Micro Strategy are doing
[42:33] um and issue lots of equity and issue
[42:35] lots of debt to to buy more Bitcoin.
[42:38] That's that's extreme on the spectrum.
[42:40] For most companies, it's just saying how
[42:42] do we protect what we've got, how do we
[42:45] continue to support the company. The
[42:47] third point I was thinking of is that
[42:49] not only does a company um have a
[42:55] fiduciary duty on behalf of the
[42:57] shareholders to look after the assets of
[42:59] the company but it also has a duty to
[43:01] its
[43:03] staff and we are in a economic situation
[43:09] where there's a lot of
[43:11] uncertainty we are
[43:14] seeing the way I think about it is that
[43:17] there's a lot of there's a big bubble.
[43:18] There's a lot of stresses and strains
[43:20] within the economy within the monetary
[43:23] system. We no one knows the exact
[43:26] timing. It's like when does the last
[43:27] snowflake land on a snow drift to turn
[43:30] into an avalanche? No one knows exactly
[43:32] when that's going to be, but we know we
[43:34] can see the big snow drift and we know
[43:37] that if it keeps snowing, it's going to
[43:39] turn into an avalanche. And
[43:42] so with that in mind, companies should
[43:45] not only be looking to look after their
[43:48] shareholders from a maintaining value of
[43:50] the business point of view, but they
[43:52] should also be looking at how do they
[43:54] help their staff, how do they support
[43:56] their staff through what could be an
[43:58] extremely difficult time. Um and there
[44:03] may be a need now even if it's only a
[44:05] plan B if we go through some kind of
[44:08] monetary reset or high inflation period
[44:11] which is uh I see it as essentially
[44:15] inevitable. We just don't know the
[44:17] timing. Um then what is it what is each
[44:20] company going to do? How are they going
[44:22] to continue to pay their staff um in a
[44:24] way that mean supports their staff? And
[44:28] so a plan B could be to get the
[44:31] infrastructure set up so you can pay
[44:33] people in Bitcoin
[44:35] um even if they still take the vast
[44:37] majority of their salary in the in the
[44:39] local fiat currency. And one of the um
[44:43] one of the things that that can help
[44:44] with as well is if if they let's say
[44:47] they're just paying 20 pounds a month of
[44:49] Bitcoin to to their
[44:52] staff then that does what you mentioned
[44:55] earlier which is it means those people
[44:56] suddenly they after a few months they've
[44:58] only got 100 qus worth of
[45:01] Bitcoin but it's still more than zero
[45:04] and it's it being more than zero means
[45:06] that normally people start what is this
[45:08] thing that I've been given? what and
[45:11] they start reading and they start
[45:12] watching podcasts and they start uh you
[45:16] know studying this area and that can
[45:18] then change uh minds very quickly once
[45:21] they understand the benefits. It's super
[45:23] interesting when we think about the
[45:27] hurdles that might come for for
[45:29] institutions coming forward and there's
[45:32] like more and more hurdles going to get
[45:35] out of the way and those hurdles
[45:38] are differently perspected differently
[45:41] uh looked at the catalysts for adoption
[45:45] and we're seeing now what's what's kind
[45:47] of standing in the way and and for me it
[45:50] comes a lot down to time and
[45:53] education. It it's it's like we we need
[45:56] more time for things to process and then
[45:59] we also need education in all the right
[46:02] parts because even if there's like a
[46:04] regulatory thing that stands in the way
[46:07] uh like we had in in in America with the
[46:10] SA 21 or like many other different
[46:13] things that that kind of was like hard
[46:15] for for people to to to do it because of
[46:18] that. That's also kind of just comes
[46:20] down to educating the regulatories and
[46:22] and then then changing the rules and
[46:24] then there's like a lot of educational
[46:27] hurdle um coming before we get into real
[46:31] and real adoption. I mean we we have
[46:34] been in really an fast speed adoption
[46:38] wave since the starting. There's always
[46:40] this talk each cycle like oh is it a
[46:43] super cycle or is like how how fast is
[46:45] now I think since 16 years we're in a
[46:48] extreme fast super cycle. If you look at
[46:51] we are 16 years old. Uh it's it's a
[46:54] teenager and we already are uh one of
[46:57] the biggest assets in the world and we
[46:59] already are uh talked about by everyone
[47:03] like like everyone heard about Bitcoin.
[47:06] Everyone has sometimes not a good but at
[47:08] least they have an opinion on Bitcoin.
[47:11] Uh maybe not always an informed or
[47:12] educated one but they have one. Uh so
[47:15] that that that's really interesting. Is
[47:17] there anything uh that that we might
[47:19] have not uh mentioned till now that
[47:22] you're really looking forward as an
[47:24] catalyst for for institutional adoption
[47:27] going forward? Any any hurdles that
[47:29] you're like, oh, like if that gets away
[47:31] or if that gets better, uh we really
[47:33] could accelerate that. I mean, I think
[47:36] there's been I think there's been a few
[47:37] hurdles and I think we've solved some of
[47:40] them. Um, so for example, we had, so
[47:45] custody would have been a good example
[47:47] of that. So I can't imagine that you'd
[47:51] have, you know, a company board or a
[47:52] trustee board a few years ago, you know,
[47:54] having 12 words on a piece of paper to
[47:56] maintain. It's just not not workable
[47:58] from an institutional point of view. Um,
[48:02] at least for the time, at least for now.
[48:05] Um, so there needs to be other custody
[48:07] options and now there are, but that's
[48:09] only of It's only of a year ago or so
[48:12] that that that has actually been
[48:14] available. And so people are still
[48:16] transitioning. If they only thought
[48:19] about custody uh you know a couple of
[48:21] years ago, they need to update their
[48:24] thinking in terms of what's now now
[48:25] available. Um another one is um ESG
[48:30] environmental, social and governance
[48:32] factors. It's quite big in
[48:35] institutional in the institutional
[48:36] world. Um there's still a general
[48:40] surprise about how ESG friendly Bitcoin
[48:45] is. Um but I think that will that
[48:48] that'll take a bit more time but that is
[48:50] that message I think is slowly getting
[48:52] through and once people look into it
[48:56] um they realize how how relevant Bitcoin
[48:59] is to to to those to having clean air,
[49:02] clean water, clean um you know good soil
[49:06] um you know to to helping people out of
[49:09] troubled war zones and um oppression um
[49:13] around the world and so and how a sound
[49:16] uh can can help with all of that. So, um
[49:19] I think that's that's still that's still
[49:21] happening. Um one of the um one of the
[49:24] we've touched on it earlier about how if
[49:28] you grew up in the institutional world,
[49:31] unless unless you're a little bit crazy
[49:33] like me, then you're, you know, you're
[49:35] on a um you feel quite comfortable on a
[49:39] uh treadmill through a career, you know,
[49:41] and this you join as a junior analyst.
[49:43] You then get promoted to a certain level
[49:45] then so on and then you're client facing
[49:48] and then you partner of a firm or
[49:49] something and you you go through that
[49:51] process and then you retire right and
[49:53] that is your expected career. There's
[49:57] nothing fundamentally wrong with that.
[49:59] But if the the issue is if you try and
[50:03] talk to someone in the middle of that
[50:05] journey on the treadmill on that career
[50:08] treadmill, you're asking them to step
[50:10] off the treadmill or at least to think
[50:13] about stepping off the
[50:15] treadmill. Um, and that is way too risky
[50:20] for many people. Also, you know, I
[50:22] remember doing the actual exams and
[50:25] there was one on economics and it was
[50:27] essentially canes versus monitoriism.
[50:29] That was it. And I said, are you sure
[50:31] that this is all there is to economics?
[50:33] All we're doing is drawing a few lines
[50:35] on a few charts. Um, and well, do you
[50:38] want to pass the exam? Well, yeah,
[50:39] obviously I want to pass the exam. I
[50:40] just want to get it out of the way. Um,
[50:43] but then when you're looking back, you
[50:45] realize you just wasted loads of
[50:46] people's time with economics that
[50:48] doesn't actually make any sense. Um, and
[50:52] so a lot of people will have to go back
[50:54] and unlearn things like that. And the
[50:56] problem is it just takes time even for
[50:58] those that are willing to do so. So
[51:02] we're in a we're in a process. Um, we're
[51:04] in a I think it's the process is um
[51:08] helped and
[51:10] encouraged by things like the price of
[51:13] Bitcoin going up, things like then
[51:16] people keep thinking why isn't it
[51:18] digest? In theory, it's meant to have
[51:20] died. In practice, it hasn't. And at
[51:23] what point do they then challenge
[51:24] themselves to say, "Maybe there's
[51:27] something here. Maybe there's something
[51:29] I need to to dig in a bit deeper. Maybe
[51:30] I'm missing something." So, I I think
[51:33] that will all help. I think the
[51:36] newspapers seem to be turning in terms
[51:38] of the ESG messages, which is positive.
[51:41] Daniel Batton does some great work in
[51:43] terms of digging out stories and and
[51:45] looking at studies and so on. So, um,
[51:49] he's someone that's worth worth checking
[51:51] out. Um, stuff that's happening in
[51:54] America with Trump. Um, I mean, I'm not
[51:58] saying it's all good. I mean, I winced
[52:01] when Trumpcoin came
[52:03] out, but,
[52:06] uh, you know, that aside, um, some of
[52:08] the stuff on Bitcoin should be very
[52:10] helpful and that gives a solid
[52:11] foundation. You've got lots of different
[52:12] things that happening and you've got
[52:14] lots of also lots of different things at
[52:16] a sort of global level. You got lots of
[52:18] things that happen at a grassroots level
[52:21] and it's a case of as they come together
[52:24] it's not a linear impact that they'll
[52:27] have because they'll be um reacting with
[52:30] each other along the way. Um it's it's a
[52:33] form of network effect I suppose. And so
[52:36] that's where I think the gradually event
[52:38] suddenly probably comes from or or at
[52:40] least should apply because at some point
[52:43] we will get that suddenly but we've no
[52:45] idea just like that snowflake landing on
[52:48] a on a snow drift to Tony Ambrod. We've
[52:50] no idea of the timing.
[52:52] Yeah, it's
[52:54] you you have now this interesting
[52:57] opportunity of Bitcoin and you know it's
[53:00] kind of coming. Um, nobody can really
[53:02] tell you when exactly or how fast or
[53:05] like how rocky the the way to there will
[53:08] be, but you know, you know it's coming.
[53:10] Uh, and this is the exciting part. It's
[53:13] actually uh you said it previously, you
[53:15] said uh early on, I think Bitcoin makes
[53:18] things better or something along those
[53:20] lines. Um, how do you expect um a
[53:23] Bitcoin world to look like? How do you
[53:25] imagine uh a world looking different
[53:29] because we use a different better sound
[53:32] money in ways that I'm not sure I can
[53:34] even imagine. So but I think the I think
[53:37] that's the thing when you start looking
[53:39] into when I for me when I started
[53:41] looking into the
[53:44] um the problems with fiat currency and
[53:49] all the different ways in which it can
[53:50] affect things that we see around us.
[53:53] What we need to do is we need to
[53:55] separate out cause cause and symptoms.
[54:00] The problem is that for vast majority of
[54:03] people understandably you know it's not
[54:04] not a criticism understandably you look
[54:06] around you and you see lots of symptoms
[54:08] you think I don't like that I don't like
[54:10] this why is you know whether you're
[54:12] talking about the food quality or um you
[54:15] know architectural quality or um whole
[54:18] range of different things um or what
[54:21] feels like society getting frustrated
[54:23] and fed up and and and and getting
[54:26] angry all those things are symptoms and
[54:29] And then you drill down. It doesn't mean
[54:31] nothing else affects has an influence,
[54:34] but you drill down to the
[54:36] core of what like the original the
[54:39] original sin if you
[54:41] like and that's the ability to print
[54:45] money out of thin air and distribute it
[54:48] politically where and and and that
[54:50] creates an unlevel playing field. Um,
[54:54] one of the wealth inequality gap is
[54:57] something that a lot of people quite
[54:58] rightly are unhappy with. There'll
[55:00] always be some wealth inequality because
[55:01] some people would deliver more value to
[55:03] society than others. That's inevitable.
[55:05] But what we're talking about here, what
[55:06] I'm talking about is the artificial
[55:08] wealth inequality gap. That that
[55:12] shouldn't exist. It only exists because
[55:14] we have a money which creates a uh an
[55:18] unlevel playing field.
[55:21] um what Bitcoin is, what gold was sort
[55:24] of. Um gold did gold gold's done a
[55:27] bloody good job for 5,000 years. So um
[55:30] you know, we should give it the respect
[55:32] that it's due. Um it's just that
[55:35] Bitcoin's better. Um and Bitcoin
[55:37] provides a level playing field for
[55:40] everyone. And that I think affects so
[55:44] many areas of our lives. If if if when
[55:47] anyone listen to this as they're walking
[55:49] around and they get frustrated with
[55:51] something that's going on in the news or
[55:53] whatever and think if there was a level
[55:54] playing
[55:55] field, would that issue exist? Nine
[55:58] times out of 10, no it wouldn't. I love
[56:00] that. Yeah. And and and gold was an
[56:03] amazing and it's is the best solution
[56:06] till electricity and internet came
[56:08] along. Then all of the sudden this was
[56:09] useless.
[56:11] It's like all of the sudden you're like,
[56:12] "Hey, I can send messages to my friend
[56:15] in America." Like, "Why can I not send
[56:17] gold to my friend in America?" Oh, yeah,
[56:19] that's Bitcoin. I suspect we'll go
[56:22] through a transition period where gold
[56:23] will still, you know, will still be will
[56:26] still provide a lot of value for a lot
[56:27] of people.
[56:29] Um, but given enough time, and we don't
[56:32] know what time that means, given enough
[56:34] time, then Bitcoin will shine through.
[56:37] um it's got better qualities from a
[56:39] money perspective um not least it's not
[56:42] physical
[56:44] um and so those will shine through over
[56:46] time. How do you actually look at uh uh
[56:50] this is one more topic I want to get
[56:51] into with you is is circular economy and
[56:53] and we talked a little bit about it
[56:55] before. Um it's super interesting. the
[56:58] someone brought that point up I think
[57:00] also uh a few days ago in in a podcast
[57:04] of mine um where he said uh gold now is
[57:09] kind of a store of value but it failed
[57:13] as a mean of exchange and therefore it
[57:15] cannot capture the full potential as a
[57:18] store of value because it's kind of hard
[57:20] to like spend around and and so you like
[57:24] you you rather just go to like a bitcoin
[57:26] that you can already spent a little bit.
[57:29] And then we have uh and you mentioned
[57:31] him also before, Jeff Bof, who said on
[57:34] the last podcast I had him on um uh that
[57:37] if Bitcoin fails as a minimum exchange,
[57:39] it will also fail as a store of value,
[57:42] which got me thinking of like, okay,
[57:44] gold clearly failed as a minimum of
[57:47] exchange. So it but it is still the
[57:50] biggest asset. So it I don't know if it
[57:53] it failed already as a store of value,
[57:55] but it might fail longterm as a store of
[57:57] value. If all the store of value also
[58:00] goes to to Bitcoin and gold kind of gets
[58:02] to a utility value, just just for the
[58:05] record, I think that's a long ways out
[58:06] that gold gets demonetized. Uh the the
[58:10] uh many other things probably get
[58:12] demonetized beforehand. Um but Bitcoin
[58:16] has that store of value mean exchange
[58:18] side of things. how how important is the
[58:22] medium of exchange actually for store of
[58:25] value when you look at what Jeff said
[58:28] and and and how those things
[58:31] correlate. So um I think Jeff's amazing
[58:34] by the way. So I'm not sure exactly of
[58:37] the context of that comment, but I
[58:39] suppose what one thing I'd say is that
[58:42] store of value it's like it's still a
[58:44] medium of exchange. It's just a medium
[58:46] of exchange with my future self.
[58:49] So it's already acting as a medium
[58:51] change in that sense. Um having said
[58:54] that I do think uh we can't expect it to
[58:57] happen as quickly as store value store
[59:00] value happens first then medium exchange
[59:02] obviously some overlap then medium
[59:03] exchange and finally we'll all be
[59:04] talking in terms of how much is a pint
[59:06] of milk milk in sats rather than in um
[59:10] pounds dollars euros. So it needs to go
[59:13] through that process. It needs to be
[59:14] given time. That's what often a lot of
[59:16] people don't factor into their thinking
[59:19] is is things need time to develop. Um,
[59:23] but I do think we're at the start of
[59:25] that medium of
[59:27] exchange adoption curve if you like.
[59:29] We've had it for store of value and that
[59:32] has got a long way to run. Um but we
[59:35] need to get it going for medium exchange
[59:37] and therefore I think it's important
[59:39] that we we support you know I mean one
[59:44] approach is just just to get out of fiat
[59:47] entirely
[59:48] um just hold Bitcoin just um spend
[59:52] Bitcoin
[59:54] um saving Bitcoin uh that's a lot that's
[59:57] that's a a purest way I suppose of
[60:01] really taking it um to its logical
[60:04] conclusion and I I think is aligned with
[60:07] Jeff's view that if you're still using
[60:10] the local f currency, you're effectively
[60:12] supporting that. Um so why not support
[60:16] the system that you believe in and that
[60:20] has your values rather than the one that
[60:22] doesn't. So I think I think that makes
[60:24] makes a lot of sense to me. Um but we
[60:26] need to we need to keep pushing that
[60:28] medium exchange. Um, and as people build
[60:32] up enough Bitcoin themselves, then
[60:33] they'll feel more comfortable um,
[60:36] spending it uh, locally. And we're
[60:39] seeing um, I don't know, need to check
[60:41] the numbers. I think we're up to about 4
[60:43] 500 places in the UK that accept
[60:45] Bitcoin. So, it's still quite
[60:47] small, but it was probably zero three or
[60:49] four years ago. Maybe not quite zero,
[60:51] but close to zero. So, um, that number
[60:55] of places growing exponentially.
[60:58] Um, so I'd encourage everyone
[61:00] to to spend some of their Bitcoin. It's
[61:03] a good point of if you use voluntarily
[61:06] feared, you're supporting it. I mean, if
[61:10] you are forced to use it to pay taxes,
[61:13] to pay at a restaurant because they
[61:16] don't accept anything
[61:18] else. What what choice do you have?
[61:20] Maybe you can only also go really pure
[61:22] and say, "Hey, because even in Vienna,
[61:26] there are restaurants that accept
[61:27] Bitcoin. So, I only go to restaurants
[61:29] that accept Bitcoin, but that shrinks
[61:32] down your restaurants to like five
[61:35] uh or
[61:36] like so you could be um so you're
[61:40] supporting a particular money if you
[61:43] have a positive value of that currency.
[61:47] If you have a negative value, then
[61:48] you're you're you're doing the opposite.
[61:49] If you have zero, you're not supporting
[61:51] it at all. Um, if you're, yeah, it's
[61:54] negative balance, then you're
[61:55] unsupporting it, if you like. So,
[61:59] uh, you know, some people, uh, might, so
[62:02] they go to a restaurant that doesn't
[62:03] accept Bitcoin, but they pay on a credit
[62:04] card, so they're negative fiat, and then
[62:08] they may pay that off with, uh, their
[62:10] next pay packet or their, you know, from
[62:12] their from their Bitcoin. Um and so that
[62:14] is a way of um essentially getting
[62:17] around
[62:19] uh that not everyone accepts Bitcoin
[62:20] yet. But then if you can if you can if
[62:23] you can send your business to places
[62:25] that do then you encourage more
[62:27] businesses to accept Bitcoin and um the
[62:30] snowball effect will uh will take
[62:33] place%. That's actually how I did do it.
[62:36] I try to stay at 0% fiat and 100%
[62:39] Bitcoin and uh whenever I spend um it's
[62:43] it's from overdraft and then I just uh
[62:46] pay that off with with Bitcoin. If I get
[62:48] more feared in then I'll uh buy Bitcoin
[62:52] with that. Um but my my income is
[62:55] already like 70% in Bitcoin. Uh and uh
[62:59] my expenses are let's say 10 maybe 10
[63:02] 15% in in Bitcoin. Uh, so I do have to
[63:05] sell some Bitcoin to to to pay the
[63:08] bills. It's a hu ever since I decided
[63:12] that and it's not that long ago
[63:13] actually. It's like a couple of months
[63:15] ago that I decided I'm just 100% in
[63:17] Bitcoin because I had that thing. Do I
[63:20] go 100% in Bitcoin or do I borrow out my
[63:25] Bitcoin and get feared? I had I had that
[63:28] I have both those strategies in in mind,
[63:31] but I wanted to go with the one where I
[63:34] can sleep sound at night and where I
[63:37] have no worries at all. I just have
[63:40] Bitcoin as my savings device and when I
[63:43] spend I have my fiat bank account and I
[63:46] just pay it off with Bitcoin. It's super
[63:48] easy. I there are providers where you
[63:50] can go from your Bitcoin wallet to fiat
[63:54] bank account in under five minutes. It's
[63:56] it's it blows my mind from like an real
[63:59] Bitcoin wallet like not an exchange like
[64:02] an actual Bitcoin wallet with your own
[64:04] seed phrase and everything like that.
[64:06] You directly do your own uh wallet. Uh
[64:09] it's uh do your own uh bank account. So
[64:12] there's no excuse. And people say like
[64:14] oh taxes and stuff like that. Yeah, but
[64:18] you only pay taxes if you made a profit
[64:21] while holding Bitcoin. So if you held
[64:23] fiat instead of Bitcoin, you wouldn't
[64:26] had make the profit. So you wouldn't had
[64:28] to pay the taxes. So holding the Bitcoin
[64:33] only gives you the tax taxes if you
[64:35] actually are in profit in that way. So I
[64:38] don't know. It's it's kind of a
[64:40] no-brainer for me to be as allocated as
[64:42] possible in Bitcoin. I don't know how
[64:44] you look at that. Yeah. Um increasingly
[64:47] so. Um uh I mean I'm not saying anyone
[64:50] should rack up big credit card bills
[64:52] that they shouldn't pay. Pay it off
[64:53] every month I think is the is is the
[64:56] right advice from those people that that
[64:58] can give that kind of advice but um it's
[65:00] just a way of of sort of managing the
[65:02] transition um over the next few years. I
[65:06] mean one thing that will help actually
[65:07] is that the so our financial conduct
[65:10] authority the regulator is over here in
[65:12] the
[65:13] UK has got a road map um to essentially
[65:18] put regulations in place and exactly all
[65:20] the implications of that is not yet
[65:22] clear but it means that it's got it
[65:24] means you got a framework it means that
[65:26] people are you know they're not they're
[65:27] not banning it because they put a
[65:29] framework in place and so and there
[65:31] regulations around it and how you
[65:33] operate and so on um And so I think
[65:35] that'll give a lot of people more
[65:37] comfort um and actually hopefully helps
[65:41] uh some people avoid uh some of the you
[65:44] know some of the some of the altcoins
[65:46] which are you know some of them are just
[65:48] pure scams as far as I can tell. So just
[65:50] avoiding them entirely hopefully
[65:51] focusing on Bitcoin. Um they're worried
[65:55] about people taking a lot of credit card
[65:56] debt out to buy crypto assets as they
[65:59] call them sounds a legitimate concern to
[66:03] me. what um people should be uh saving
[66:06] in Bitcoin. They shouldn't be um it
[66:09] feels too much like gambling if you're
[66:10] taking out expensive debt to to buy
[66:13] stuff that you don't know what's going
[66:14] to happen in the next few months.
[66:17] Yeah. And it's just I think even if you
[66:20] borrow against I mean it's a hard
[66:23] argument to make but I think if you use
[66:25] the feed system if if you're not forced
[66:28] to use it you are supporting it in a
[66:32] way. So using the fiat system to get
[66:34] more Bitcoin or to borrow against your
[66:37] Bitcoin, I'm I'm just not a fan of it.
[66:39] It just feels
[66:40] wrong for me. But uh maybe I'm just too
[66:43] pure for that. Um I have one question
[66:46] that I ask each and every one of my
[66:47] guests and the question is what can we
[66:49] learn from you besides Bitcoin? Oh,
[66:52] okay. That's an interesting question. Um
[66:55] you mean about me or
[66:58] it is uh entirely up to you. I I I let
[67:01] the question open. So like you uh about
[67:04] you personally or like a skill or like
[67:05] something you have learned or like and
[67:08] wise sentence you want to share with us
[67:10] like whatever you want to share you can
[67:12] share. Um okay I I'll I'll mention
[67:14] something that um they did a couple of
[67:17] years ago and um was
[67:20] uh incredibly enlightening I think on
[67:22] the oval um journey. uh which so I took
[67:27] my teenage son to
[67:29] Tanzania and it was uh I mean it's quite
[67:32] a long way from UK to Tanzania and it
[67:35] was a fascinating experience and we were
[67:37] helping out a a charity and we're doing
[67:40] things like we're on a building site
[67:42] building a classroom and uh planting
[67:44] trees and things like that so trying to
[67:46] be as useful as possible and um one of
[67:50] the things there was there was two
[67:51] things that I I picked up which were of
[67:53] particular
[67:54] interest to me. So, one was um uh one
[67:59] one was that there's motorbikes all over
[68:02] the place in
[68:03] Tanzania and they load them up
[68:08] ridiculously, right? So, one had a
[68:10] trailer on that I saw or one was they
[68:12] were hold literally holding a pane of
[68:14] glass. The guy two guys, one was driving
[68:17] guy behind him on the motorbike was
[68:18] holding a pane of glass like this.
[68:20] Absolutely ridiculous. So they're piled
[68:22] up, tipping over left, right, and
[68:24] center. And it's But what I loved about
[68:27] it was that it gave it a buzz. And
[68:30] apparently that's really only in the
[68:31] last few years that that it's been there
[68:33] been as many motorbikes as there have.
[68:35] And it shows um economic progress. It
[68:39] shows um I guess some kind of
[68:42] entrepreneurial spirit and the way that
[68:44] you they're using the motorbikes. So I
[68:45] do I quite like that from
[68:47] a different perspective point of view.
[68:50] The other perspective that I I picked up
[68:53] was around how they approach money. And
[68:56] I have to sort of dig deep to try and
[68:58] remember some of those those principles,
[68:59] but they they look at money um very
[69:03] differently to how we look at o over
[69:05] here. Um so they uh essentially if you
[69:09] have money in your pocket, it seems to
[69:11] this is obviously general rule. There's
[69:13] going to be different people have have
[69:15] varants of this. if you have money in
[69:18] your pocket, it doesn't really belong to
[69:19] you. It belongs to whoever is the most
[69:22] in
[69:23] need. Um, and that was quite
[69:26] interesting. I guess it was it was
[69:28] understandable because you have a
[69:30] continent there that's had havoc wreaked
[69:34] whether it's through different types of
[69:36] a disaster whether it's
[69:38] um whether it's natural disasters um
[69:42] whether it's um you know the western
[69:45] nations going over and invading and
[69:47] colonizing
[69:49] um whether it's internal political
[69:51] struggles or tribal struggles you don't
[69:55] know from one day to the next um whether
[69:59] you know how much whether whether
[70:00] someone will come along and you still
[70:01] have that money in your pocket and
[70:02] therefore you might as well give it do a
[70:03] favor for someone now because tomorrow
[70:05] you might need the favor back. Um and I
[70:08] thought that was that was interesting to
[70:10] me around the sort of you know the high
[70:13] time preference I suppose idea and that
[70:16] there seems to be a very high time
[70:17] preference because they don't know
[70:19] what's happening from one day to the
[70:20] next. Um there was quite a bit more on
[70:23] that, but that I found that particularly
[70:26] um interesting and uh well some point
[70:30] I've got no plans to yet, but at some
[70:32] point I'd like to like to go back and
[70:34] and and see how things have changed. Um
[70:37] that's interesting. I've I've seen that
[70:41] there's in Austria you cannot think of
[70:44] that but loading trucks as you said with
[70:47] the this glass thing uh it's I mean my
[70:50] my my girlfriend is is coming from India
[70:53] so she's she she saw that a lot in in in
[70:57] the in the world and I saw it the first
[70:59] time ever in El Salvador actually when I
[71:03] was for the Bitcoin conference and it
[71:06] was so unbelievable for There was just a
[71:09] bus where you can stand on the truck pad
[71:14] uh on on the bus behind and and people
[71:17] were just jumping on it while it was
[71:19] still like driving and they were jumping
[71:21] off it and and and there was like no
[71:23] guard rails, nothing. And uh it it was
[71:27] Yeah, it is really unbelievable. In
[71:29] Vienna, we have uh at some stations
[71:32] already the class in front of the Yuban.
[71:34] So you cannot jump in into
[71:36] into the yuban and then then in some
[71:40] countries like El Salvador like probably
[71:42] like even even bigger in India and other
[71:46] other parts of the world uh you have
[71:48] just like huge uh um huge trucks where
[71:52] you can just jump on and off. Uh and
[71:55] also the
[71:57] uh the thing of having just a motorcycle
[72:01] is is really big and and
[72:03] transporting bigger than you think
[72:06] things with that small motorcycle is is
[72:09] apparently a thing and and I've I've
[72:11] seen that also some sometimes. So that
[72:14] that's super interesting. Uh so
[72:16] different different cultures uh deal
[72:18] deal with those. I became a bit addicted
[72:21] to taking pictures of motorcycles while
[72:23] I was out there cuz so many crazy ones.
[72:27] Yeah, they are they are really crazy
[72:29] ones. Um I have an end in the podcast
[72:32] where the previous guest is asking a
[72:34] question for the next guest without
[72:35] knowing who the next guest actually is.
[72:37] And the previous guest asked you the
[72:38] question, do you think borrowed dollars
[72:41] are the best layer 2 aka the best way to
[72:45] spend bitcoin? It's a we already talked
[72:47] about that a little bit. What do you say
[72:50] the what to dollars? Uh yeah, borrow
[72:53] dollars. So um what we talked about is I
[72:57] think I think you just spend the
[72:58] bitcoin. Stay unleveraged. Don't put the
[73:01] rest of your stack at risk. It's money.
[73:04] It's there to be spent um when you need
[73:06] it. Hopefully, you've already uh got
[73:09] into your mind that you're only going to
[73:12] spend money on things you really need.
[73:13] So, if you really need it, you should
[73:16] just spend spend your money.
[73:18] I love that. I agree with that. Thank
[73:21] you so much, uh Sam, for for for being
[73:23] on the show. Before I let you go, where
[73:25] can people find you and ask questions?
[73:28] So the two two best places are so one is
[73:30] go to our website
[73:34] cartrides.co.uk. You'll be able to uh
[73:37] find me through there somehow. Uh and
[73:39] also LinkedIn is probably the other best
[73:41] place to to find me. Really cool.
[73:43] Perfect. And thank you so much for your
[73:44] time, Sam. And also thank you so much
[73:46] for everyone that is watching and
[73:47] listening for joining us today. As
[73:48] always, I'll be back tomorrow with
[73:50] another episode. Bye-bye.
