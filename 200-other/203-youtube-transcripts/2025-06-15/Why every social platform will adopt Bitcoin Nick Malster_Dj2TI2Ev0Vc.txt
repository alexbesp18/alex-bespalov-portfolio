[00:00] seeing the number of Satoshi is a much
[00:02] better signal than the number of likes
[00:04] because it is a true signal of value
[00:06] only if you really like something and
[00:08] you're going to send some SATs like my
[00:10] thoughts on nosta is that it's very
[00:12] difficult to you know challenge the
[00:14] network effect that an app like Twitter
[00:16] has right because of its scale because
[00:17] of the size of the community and you
[00:19] know the Habit creation that's formed
[00:20] with millions of users around the world
[00:22] where do you see content creators
[00:24] getting the money in like 10 years value
[00:26] for value is going to be a very popular
[00:28] way for creators to man Iz that's a
[00:30] great thing because it really encourages
[00:32] podcasters to optimize for creating
[00:34] value for their biggest fans and that
[00:36] value will be returned we think of
[00:38] Fountain as a bit of a trojan horse for
[00:40] Bitcoin of course it's powered by
[00:41] Bitcoin the experience is you know made
[00:43] possible because of Bitcoin what would
[00:45] YouTube be worth without Mr Beast what
[00:47] would spotify's position in podcasting
[00:49] be without Joe
[00:51] Rogan what did you do before the before
[00:55] you entered the whole space with Bitcoin
[00:57] and the fountain
[00:58] app yeah uh so before I started Fountain
[01:02] I was working in advertising in London
[01:04] so I started out in different creative
[01:08] digital design agencies um did that for
[01:11] a number of years that was a lot of fun
[01:13] you know working in an agency you get a
[01:15] lot of experience to different things
[01:17] working with different people high
[01:19] pressure environments um and yeah but I
[01:22] got I got to the point with it really
[01:24] where you know it was it was it was hard
[01:27] work and I basically burnt out and and I
[01:30] kind of said to myself you know what
[01:32] maybe you should work client side
[01:34] instead of working in agencies so that's
[01:36] what I did I went to to Nike and I
[01:38] worked there for three years uh working
[01:40] in brand marketing which was a great
[01:42] experience you know Nike is a amazing
[01:45] company I love sport so it was the right
[01:47] place for me to be um to be honest most
[01:49] of my time there was during the lockdown
[01:51] so it was a little bit limiting but it
[01:54] was it was in that time really where I
[01:56] had you know particularly in lockdown
[01:57] had a bit more time to think about what
[01:59] ultim it is I wanted to do and I always
[02:02] wanted to start my own business and and
[02:04] be an entrepreneur so that was a great
[02:06] opportunity to to start exploring that I
[02:09] think it's funny that in the co time a
[02:12] lot of people uh started thinking and
[02:14] started pursuing their dreams even
[02:16] though we were in complete lockdown
[02:18] because I did that myself I started my
[02:21] social media back then um and how did
[02:24] you find uh Bitcoin then after
[02:27] that yeah so I was I was aware of
[02:29] Bitcoin for a long time you know I had
[02:31] people close to me telling me about it
[02:33] and uh yeah I guess I just wasn't really
[02:36] curious enough to um to to explore it
[02:39] further at that point and it was it was
[02:42] in 2020 maybe 2021 when you know price
[02:47] of Bitcoin was going up interest was
[02:48] going up in in Bitcoin itself and yeah
[02:53] it kind of It kind of um crossed over
[02:55] with the with the beginning of Fountain
[02:57] really uh we started Fountain it wasn't
[02:59] always the podcast app it didn't always
[03:01] have Bitcoin integrated but it was
[03:04] really a case of right place right time
[03:06] you know we saw what was happening with
[03:07] podcasting 2.0 the new specification
[03:10] that allowed you to to send you know
[03:12] micro payments in in Bitcoin and yeah
[03:15] that's where I started and from then on
[03:17] you know it was really uh well it was I
[03:20] started really by reading the Bitcoin
[03:22] standard that's obviously a lot of uh a
[03:25] lot of bitcoiners have the same
[03:26] experience but that was that was mine
[03:28] also and um from there just started to
[03:31] listen to bitcoin podcasts but I think
[03:33] most importantly you know actually
[03:35] working in Bitcoin having a Bitcoin
[03:38] product which is what we quickly uh
[03:40] arrived at with Fountain that's the best
[03:42] experience you can get because your
[03:44] hands on you're talking to bitcoiners
[03:46] every day um and you kind of grow to
[03:50] understand how the Bitcoin thinks and um
[03:54] yeah your your mind expands from there I
[03:55] guess yeah in the beginning you said on
[03:58] another podcast I think it was like a
[04:00] voice messaging can send voice memos to
[04:05] each other Fountain right how did it
[04:07] start yeah it was it was uh nothing to
[04:09] do with podcasting it was um it was just
[04:11] a way to record short uh voice messages
[04:14] and share them with your followers but
[04:16] we we struggled really because we we uh
[04:19] yeah at this stage we were very early
[04:20] just exploring the idea um but we didn't
[04:23] have anyone to make content found it
[04:24] very difficult to persuade people to
[04:26] make content for us which is why we
[04:28] decided to launch a podcast instead
[04:30] because we can just bring all the
[04:31] content in that exists already and then
[04:33] just kind of create new tools to uh to
[04:36] to share that and and support it and and
[04:39] also discover content that's relevant to
[04:41] you and why was then Bitcoin integrated
[04:44] in in
[04:46] Fountain yeah so like I said it was a
[04:48] case of right place right time um we saw
[04:51] what Adam Curry was doing with
[04:52] podcasting 2.0 um just a a a brief
[04:55] background on podcasting 2.0 it's
[04:58] essentially a um a movement that's uh
[05:02] really designed to um you know firstly
[05:06] protect um the the aspect of free speech
[05:09] in podcasting by having a decentralized
[05:11] index of podcasts so an index which the
[05:14] likes of apple or Spotify or any other
[05:16] kind of major player in the podcasting
[05:19] industrial complex can't mess with and
[05:21] remove content because it doesn't meet
[05:23] their requirement so that was the the
[05:25] first part of the project and then the
[05:27] second part was really about creating
[05:29] new um I suppose language for developers
[05:32] to build uh new features and tools on
[05:35] top of the RSS feed in a way that was
[05:36] compatible across every different app
[05:39] and one of those features was value for
[05:41] Value um you know value for value is not
[05:44] a new idea in fact it was Adam Curry
[05:47] many years ago along with John Dvorak
[05:49] who I suppose pioneered it in podcasting
[05:52] with their Show No Agenda so previously
[05:54] they were taking checks in the post they
[05:57] were taking donations through payer pal
[06:00] the show was always 100% audience funded
[06:03] and the the audience kind of in
[06:05] instinctively knew that to keep the
[06:08] content coming and uh you know to keep
[06:10] the the quality of the content good to
[06:12] support the show was necessary um Adam
[06:15] and John obviously did a lot of
[06:16] messaging around that to to listeners to
[06:18] to let them know but this really caught
[06:21] our attention because uh you know we
[06:24] identified that initially as a as a
[06:26] problem that we could solve for
[06:27] podcasters you know an easy way for you
[06:30] to get paid by your fans and it
[06:32] definitely serves that purpose still
[06:34] today um and it's continually improving
[06:37] as a um I suppose an income or Revenue
[06:40] Source but I think that it was after
[06:43] playing around with value forv value
[06:45] payments a little bit more that we
[06:46] really discovered their true potential
[06:49] we realized that you know firstly not
[06:53] every listener wants to pay for
[06:55] something that is already free right so
[06:59] we had to think about how what is what
[07:01] is really in this for the listener you
[07:03] know there's obviously um listeners out
[07:06] there who who want to support the things
[07:08] they love because they want to see them
[07:09] succeed but you know it's not the whole
[07:12] of your audience but really and I think
[07:14] this you know relates to you and your
[07:16] podcast as well you know the listeners
[07:18] who do really care and you know are
[07:20] really true fans would do anything to
[07:23] help you succeed and grow the podcast
[07:25] and expand the community and bring it to
[07:27] New listeners and so we decided to
[07:30] actually make the boosts public and a
[07:32] boost is just a a comment with a payment
[07:34] attached right so you're sending a
[07:36] payment from one lightning address to
[07:38] another and we made those comments
[07:40] public so that you could actually use
[07:43] the Boost as a discovery tool and based
[07:46] on you know the existing infrastructure
[07:48] we had with the early version of the app
[07:50] where you could follow other people we
[07:51] had that same functionality in Fountain
[07:53] as well so if I'm following you Robin I
[07:56] can see when you boost a podcast that
[07:58] for me is an amazing signal that uh
[08:00] helps me understand the value of the
[08:03] thing I'm seeing you know seeing the
[08:05] number of Satoshi is a much better
[08:07] signal than the number of likes because
[08:09] it is a true signal of value only if you
[08:12] really like something and you're going
[08:13] to send some STS um and then from there
[08:16] we just kind of realized that value for
[08:18] value is is really much more of a
[08:20] community it's not just a you know one
[08:22] directional payment from from listener
[08:24] to podcaster it's um about surfacing
[08:27] those payments across a community to
[08:29] Drive Discovery uh and ultimately create
[08:32] a a better experience for podcasters and
[08:34] I think that is a a bigger problem than
[08:37] the problem we were trying to solve
[08:38] initially for podcasters which is
[08:40] there's so many podcasts out there
[08:42] there's not enough time to listen to
[08:43] them all like how can I see the podcasts
[08:47] that are really valuable to the people
[08:49] um that I follow to decide what to
[08:51] listen to next yeah and I think it also
[08:55] erodes the problem of like Bots because
[08:57] you can maybe found a bot machine but if
[09:01] you have to pay like five sets for
[09:04] millions of bots it becomes really
[09:06] really fast really expensive like there
[09:09] are a lot of things uh in like I was in
[09:13] the early days also with the the Nostra
[09:16] apps and other apps and right now I'm
[09:18] more on like fountain on Twitter and not
[09:21] a lot on on Nostra and other apps that
[09:24] are value for value and I would love to
[09:27] have all the apps like also Twitter like
[09:29] integrate the like button but maybe like
[09:31] an additional button where I can like
[09:34] tip satosi with a few clicks that would
[09:36] be such an amazing experience uh but
[09:40] it's not there and I think that would be
[09:42] an amazing future but I don't know if we
[09:45] we we come there because it's like you
[09:47] have to pay for it and and Nostra how do
[09:50] you see Nostra and and the Twitter thing
[09:53] like I found find myself always coming
[09:55] back to Twitter always finding the
[09:57] content more on Twitter and and less on
[10:00] Nostra uh or do you have stats for like
[10:04] Fountain versus other podcast platforms
[10:07] like Spotify and and YouTube do you see
[10:09] like how long are people on the fountain
[10:11] La uh like do you have any stats you can
[10:14] you can
[10:16] share well I think just firstly like my
[10:19] thoughts on nosta is that you know it's
[10:21] it's very difficult to um you know
[10:24] challenge the network effect that an app
[10:26] like Twitter has right because of its
[10:27] scale because of the size of the
[10:29] community and um you know the Habit
[10:31] creation that's formed with millions of
[10:33] users around the world um that being
[10:35] said though it does um it does offer a
[10:39] great alternative way to talk to people
[10:41] and I think what nosta has that Twitter
[10:44] doesn't have is the interoperability you
[10:46] know to be able to you know which
[10:48] regardless of which Noster client you're
[10:49] using to be able to hold those
[10:51] conversations across different apps and
[10:54] that's something that we're really
[10:55] excited to leverage with Fountain as
[10:57] well um because we obviously see
[11:00] podcasters post their latest episodes on
[11:02] Twitter there's a certain amount of
[11:04] conversation there but it's not really
[11:07] optimized towards the listening
[11:09] experience you know because you have
[11:10] this balance of okay I'm watching a
[11:13] YouTube video but I also want to look at
[11:14] the comments and actually I don't
[11:16] necessarily want to be listening to a
[11:18] full podcast on Twitter I want to just
[11:20] be using a podcast app how can I have
[11:22] The Best of Both Worlds where I can
[11:24] consume the podcast on the go in the car
[11:26] when I'm walking but then also see all
[11:28] the engagement the activity with with
[11:30] the community there and so quite soon
[11:33] we're going to be um launching the next
[11:36] iteration of our nosta integration
[11:38] whereby um you know if someone sends a
[11:41] boost on Fountain that will automate
[11:44] automatically propagate as an activity
[11:46] event in nosta so you know if you're on
[11:50] nosta you would see the booth sent from
[11:52] Fountain you could actually reply to it
[11:54] from nosta and your reply would then
[11:57] populate in Fountain so you can actually
[11:59] have conversations not only between
[12:01] Noster apps but also um other products
[12:04] and services like Fountain and I expect
[12:07] other you know lightning enabled um you
[12:10] know mobile applications to to start to
[12:12] look at a similar thing because that
[12:14] solves the problem of like cross app
[12:16] comments how can we talk to each other
[12:18] uh across these different apps um and
[12:21] then yeah as for stats for listening
[12:25] um yeah I think that you know typically
[12:29] for for your standard podcast you know
[12:32] it's a pretty much 50/50% 50/50 split on
[12:35] listeners on Spotify and listeners on
[12:38] Apple podcasts of course there's a few
[12:40] other smaller independent podcast apps
[12:43] there um and and we're really trying to
[12:45] break that because you know we just
[12:48] don't think these apps are really
[12:49] optimized towards you know a modern
[12:51] podcasting experience um you know that's
[12:54] enabled through the features that
[12:55] podcasting 2.0 U gives us so things like
[13:00] chapters transcripts and by the way
[13:02] these are also built in an interoperable
[13:04] way as well so as a podcaster you know
[13:07] if you're uploading chapters or
[13:08] transcripts or anything else to your
[13:10] hosting platform when you publish your
[13:12] podcast you know that um listeners on
[13:15] any app are going to be able to interact
[13:16] with those features in the same way
[13:18] that's not true of things like Spotify
[13:20] and apple podcasts you know they have
[13:21] their own proprietary tools don't work
[13:23] in that interoperable way so yeah we see
[13:27] podcasters who really get behind
[13:28] Fountain you know seeing as much as 30
[13:31] or 40% of their listeners on Fountain
[13:33] and I think ultimately that's the best
[13:35] place for their listeners to be you know
[13:37] I often see podcasters post on Twitter
[13:40] or nosta saying hey latest episode of my
[13:43] podcast is available um here are the
[13:45] links to like listen to it on Apple and
[13:48] Spotify and I always wonder like you
[13:50] know people people know instinctively
[13:53] that when a new episode's out it's going
[13:55] to be on those apps so you don't need to
[13:57] tell them and send them the link but
[13:59] really if you're directing your
[14:00] listeners to Fountain um that is much
[14:02] more beneficial for you and I'm not just
[14:04] talking about monetization either like I
[14:06] said Fountain is a tool for you know
[14:09] audience growth and engagement as much
[14:11] as it is for monetization too and I
[14:13] think our Theory really focuses on you
[14:16] know as a podcaster your biggest fans
[14:19] would do anything to kind of help you
[14:21] grow and succeed like I said and
[14:23] Fountain it you know gives you the tools
[14:24] to be able to do that so directing
[14:26] people to Fountain really maximize is
[14:29] your exposure to to new audiences and uh
[14:32] you know allows those conversations with
[14:34] listeners to happen that's a great point
[14:37] and uh I mean I can share my statistics
[14:40] uh 50% of my lists are actually on
[14:42] Fountain uh if I exclude uh Twitter and
[14:46] exclude YouTube like I also upload the
[14:49] video version of on on Twitter and and
[14:52] and YouTube but on just the podcasting
[14:56] apps like most of them come actually
[14:57] from from found I think this also a
[15:00] reason because of the the Bitcoin focus
[15:02] of my my podcast and it's it's it's
[15:06] still really small M like I have like
[15:08] maybe 50 plays per episode in in total
[15:11] just on the podcast adding platforms and
[15:13] on Twitter like 500 thousand because I
[15:16] have just my main account is there but
[15:18] uh it's it's it's great to see that
[15:20] there is growth there and then you can
[15:22] just start posting I did not promote it
[15:25] at all and it still gets fused like it
[15:28] people find it on Fountain without me
[15:31] ever directing anyone from any other app
[15:34] to Fountain that's like it's like really
[15:36] organic and natural growth inside of the
[15:39] fountain La without
[15:41] anything uh I have to do better on the
[15:44] clip side I have to create Clips I I
[15:46] want to also get people to listen on
[15:49] Fountain as you said but till now like
[15:51] my first month basically I did not do
[15:54] anything and I still have organic growth
[15:55] there it's like it's a it's really cool
[15:57] an app
[15:59] um maybe another question where do you
[16:02] see in general monetization in like 10
[16:05] years for Content creators I I have
[16:08] there are a lot of different
[16:10] possibilities for Content creators to
[16:12] make money there's ad share revenue from
[16:14] Twitter and YouTube there is brand deals
[16:17] there is value for Value uh there are so
[16:20] many different possibilities now where
[16:22] do you see uh content creators getting
[16:25] their money in like 10
[16:27] years yeah yeah it's a good question I
[16:29] think that what we see now is a range of
[16:32] different options available for not just
[16:34] podcasters but content creators more
[16:37] broadly to you know get paid for their
[16:39] work and I think that will still be the
[16:42] case in 10 years time you know it's
[16:43] important that creators do have options
[16:46] because um you know certain creators are
[16:49] comfortable with certain things and some
[16:50] aren't and also some creators will have
[16:52] the opportunity to monetize through
[16:54] certain channels and some won't an
[16:56] example of that would be you know ad
[16:58] advertising if you don't have a
[17:00] significant audience you're not going to
[17:02] make any significant Revenue through
[17:04] advertising because the cpms are so low
[17:07] right average CPM for for podcasts is
[17:10] like between 20 and $30 so you need a
[17:13] thousand listeners to to to get that
[17:15] money and that's that's you know it's
[17:17] very difficult um and yeah same thing as
[17:22] well for like you know more sponsored ad
[17:23] reads as well you know you have to be
[17:25] able to go to potential clients
[17:27] customers and say hey look at this
[17:28] audience I have look at the traction I
[17:30] have the engagement is amazing there's a
[17:32] perfect fit between your brand and the
[17:34] audience that I have and I have you know
[17:37] however many downloads per week and you
[17:39] know that's that's quite a a significant
[17:42] goal for for someone in their early
[17:43] stages to get to um it's really
[17:46] interesting to see what's happened with
[17:48] you know the the bigger deals in in
[17:51] particularly podcasting in the last year
[17:53] or two um you know Spotify as we know
[17:56] have been throwing lots of money at the
[17:58] content creators um to you know create
[18:02] content exclusively exclusively for
[18:04] their platform and it's going to be
[18:07] really interesting to see when Joe
[18:08] Rogan's deal which I believe is actually
[18:10] up for uh renewal or renegotiation this
[18:13] year you know are there any metrics that
[18:16] come out which really expose whether his
[18:19] you know audience has actually grown
[18:20] through the deal that he's done with
[18:22] Spotify um I'd say that it probably has
[18:25] but it won't have grown I think at the
[18:26] same scale as it was growing before uh
[18:29] when he didn't you know he wasn't tied
[18:30] to a single
[18:32] platform um so yeah that that's really
[18:35] interesting and you can see as well that
[18:36] Spotify have really um dialed back on
[18:38] their investment into those type of
[18:40] deals just because so many of them have
[18:42] you know failed really badly um so yeah
[18:47] and I I do believe that you know value
[18:50] for value is is going to be um a very
[18:53] popular way for creators to monetize and
[18:56] I think the great thing about that is
[18:58] it's it's accessible for anyone you know
[19:00] you don't have to have a large audience
[19:02] to be making money and people often ask
[19:05] like you know how many what percent of
[19:07] your listeners actually are going to
[19:09] support and I think Adam Curry's got
[19:10] some interesting stats here he reckons
[19:12] it's around 4% of your total listeners
[19:14] will support you um which doesn't sound
[19:17] like a lot but you know it's it comes
[19:20] back to you know there's no ceiling on
[19:23] how much you can send to a podcaster
[19:25] it's not like buy me a coffee where you
[19:27] can set hey look it's $5 or $10 or it's
[19:31] patreon where it's like hey I've got a
[19:32] monthly subscription it's like $10 for
[19:35] this $20 for that you know it's
[19:37] completely optional and it's Limitless
[19:39] so I think that that's a great thing
[19:42] because it really encourages podcasters
[19:44] to optimize for creating value for their
[19:46] biggest fans and that value will be
[19:48] returned as long as you ask in the right
[19:50] way and you do it
[19:52] consistently um and I I do believe also
[19:55] that value for Value will be integrated
[19:56] in in many other different types of um
[19:59] products and mobile applications Beyond
[20:01] podcasting as well you know we're
[20:02] already seeing that with with writing
[20:05] with video um there's so many different
[20:07] areas it can be applied in I also
[20:10] believe that we're going to see a lot of
[20:11] democratization in value for Value in
[20:13] the next few years you know when we
[20:15] started uh you know you had to have
[20:18] Bitcoin you had to have SATs in a
[20:19] lightning wallet in order to be able to
[20:21] partake in this economy uh you know we
[20:23] introduced you know the listen to earn
[20:25] idea ultimately to uh give people some
[20:28] sets give people some liquidity to start
[20:31] um supporting a podcast and have that
[20:33] experience of it particularly for those
[20:35] you know who are newcomers uh who don't
[20:37] have any Bitcoin experience and I think
[20:40] the fountain app you see today of course
[20:42] like sats are still the standard where
[20:44] you look across the app all the payments
[20:46] are Den denominated in Satoshi we are
[20:49] slowly changing that um we we believe
[20:52] that Fountain will always be powered by
[20:54] Bitcoin like we're not going to
[20:55] compromise on that because Bitcoin like
[20:58] lightning allows us to do things with
[20:59] money that traditional Fiat money can't
[21:01] do such as streaming payments you know
[21:03] micro payments um being able to split
[21:06] payments to multiple recipients all of
[21:08] these things you cannot do with a credit
[21:10] card you cannot do with PayPal um the
[21:13] the question is how do we open that
[21:15] experience up to as many kind of like
[21:18] you know new bitcoiners or non-b
[21:20] bitcoiners as possible by making it
[21:22] really easy to be on boarded into this
[21:24] ecosystem so that all you need is to
[21:26] like tap the side of your phone to
[21:28] deposit uh from your bank account or
[21:30] from Apple pay you know into your
[21:32] fountain wallet and start supporting I'm
[21:35] super excited to announce that this
[21:37] podcast just got the first ever sponsor
[21:41] I just started the podcast out like
[21:43] three months ago and now we have 21
[21:46] Bitcoin as a partner for this podcast 21
[21:51] Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one and
[21:54] they teach and preach self custody this
[21:57] is this is my goto exchange when someone
[22:01] asks me oh where can I buy my Bitcoin
[22:04] from this is the easiest entry for
[22:07] bitcoiners and if you want lower fees
[22:10] Plus at the same time support this
[22:12] podcast use code Robin and click the
[22:15] link in the
[22:17] description interesting so you will keep
[22:21] the default value Sates or will it be
[22:25] some other U default unit of account and
[22:29] you can choose whether you come whether
[22:31] it's coming from a Bitcoin wallet or
[22:33] it's coming from an an field
[22:36] wallet well yeah that that Still Remains
[22:39] to be seen you know that that part of
[22:41] the work has not been done yet in an
[22:43] ideal world upon you know First
[22:45] downloading Fountain you can just choose
[22:47] whether I want to see payments uh or see
[22:49] currencies in Satoshi in dollars and
[22:51] pounds and euros and Yen whatever you
[22:54] choose But ultimately on the back end
[22:56] those payments are still going to be
[22:57] powered by bit bit
[22:59] coin that that's uh interesting what
[23:02] like maybe you can share like what role
[23:05] uh did you see by now Fountain playing
[23:08] in Orange pilling uh people because uh I
[23:12] think most people that find a fountain
[23:16] are bitcoiners but probably not all of
[23:19] them probably some found Fountain
[23:21] without having uh the Bitcoin head going
[23:24] on in in the fountain do you see
[23:26] podcasters from
[23:28] not the Bitcoin World also being on
[23:30] Fountain and becoming friendlier to
[23:32] bitcoin or how do you do you have some
[23:35] stories or experience to share in that
[23:38] regard yeah for sure I think that in the
[23:40] early days of Fountain you know going
[23:42] back two years or so um we saw you know
[23:46] the idea of value for Value spread
[23:49] organically because it was being passed
[23:50] on from the podcast to The Listener um
[23:53] and it started I'd say mostly with
[23:56] podcasts which were about Bitcoin right
[23:58] because the hosts were already
[24:00] passionate they were already believers
[24:02] they did not need to be convinced and
[24:03] they were excited about the application
[24:05] of this new technology and wanted to
[24:06] share it with other people um we have
[24:08] seen that change over time I think that
[24:11] the most important thing is that you
[24:14] know we're not we're not necessarily
[24:16] relying on podcasters or listeners to
[24:20] orange pill other people on bitcoin
[24:22] right because you can actually orange
[24:24] pill someone based on hey there's a much
[24:26] better podcast app you could be using um
[24:29] or you know hey there's a podcast app
[24:31] where the things that you do whether it
[24:33] be listening to podcasts creating Clips
[24:36] creating playlists you can get rewarded
[24:39] for those things and I think those those
[24:41] promises are things that resonate with
[24:43] people who aren't bitcoiners so it's
[24:45] almost like I suppose we we think of
[24:48] Bitcoin as a as as a or Fountain as a
[24:50] bit of a trojan horse for Bitcoin you
[24:52] know um we're we're not primarily
[24:55] marketing ourselves as a Bitcoin app
[24:58] um of course it's powered by Bitcoin the
[25:00] experience is you know made possible
[25:02] because of Bitcoin but the way that
[25:04] people discover Fountain is is is not
[25:06] necessarily for that reason it's for the
[25:08] things I said you know a better app a
[25:10] way to be rewarded for your your time
[25:12] fairly um so yeah that's been really
[25:15] cool to see and I think you know in the
[25:17] particularly in the last year or so
[25:18] we've seen a lot more podcasters um I
[25:21] suppose join Fountain and start getting
[25:23] behind it as a platform that aren't in
[25:26] the Bitcoin space and initially we saw
[25:28] this in let's call it Bitcoin adjacent
[25:31] categories things like Finance
[25:34] technology trading um you know there's a
[25:37] lot of those types of podcasts which are
[25:39] you know popular on Fountain but I think
[25:42] we're also seeing that spill over into
[25:44] to other categories as well like you
[25:46] know Sports and gaming you know in a
[25:48] sense those are categories that are also
[25:50] connected to uh to Bitcoin in some way
[25:53] because there you know of the cultural
[25:55] spillover of Bitcoin into those um those
[25:58] genres and categories um but yeah that
[26:01] we're definitely seeing seeing more of
[26:03] that yeah I mean in some way everything
[26:06] is uh kind of connected to bitcoin if
[26:08] it's true money and it will like I have
[26:11] on my BIOS standing that I will not stop
[26:15] tweeting about Bitcoin till it's the
[26:17] base layer of our financial system so
[26:19] then it will touch just everything and I
[26:22] think also this uh having satous for
[26:26] listening and creating clips and then
[26:28] all the experience on Fountain could be
[26:29] a way to
[26:31] incentivizing Breaking the Habits Like I
[26:34] think there are people that like oh I
[26:35] listen to all my podcast only on YouTube
[26:37] I listen to all my podcast only on
[26:39] Spotify they are doing it for years and
[26:42] they're so used to it and breaking that
[26:44] habit needs some sort of incentive there
[26:47] like if if either they are having a bad
[26:50] experience with the platform and YouTube
[26:52] and Spotify I think they are doing a an
[26:56] hard job of not giving them a reason to
[26:58] leave their platform and with a bad
[27:01] experience uh so they need some
[27:03] incentive to leave it and I think
[27:06] getting paid for listening even if it's
[27:09] just a few sets and this few sets can be
[27:11] worth a lot a lot of money in like 10
[27:14] years and 20 years of time uh can break
[27:18] this network effect of of this uh big uh
[27:21] Network apps and podcasting
[27:24] apps um yeah I just on that I'd say as
[27:27] well that people people I think resonate
[27:31] with the idea that um you know the big
[27:33] tech companies are essentially you know
[27:36] buying and trading our attention without
[27:39] our permission you know through the the
[27:42] advertising uh businesses that are built
[27:44] on platforms like Twitter and Tik Tok
[27:46] and Facebook you know you know our
[27:48] attention is bought and sold and we
[27:50] we're not party to that at all you know
[27:52] we just we're kind of we're just given
[27:55] the ads um we're expected to to I guess
[27:58] put up with them you know we're even
[28:00] asked on Twitter to to pay to not see
[28:02] the ads which is I think going to be
[28:04] more common across more Platforms in the
[28:06] future and I think that's just not the
[28:07] way it should work you know I understand
[28:10] that you know advertising is kind of
[28:12] like a necessary evil for um for
[28:14] creators to get paid and some of these
[28:15] platforms to get paid but it shouldn't
[28:17] come at the expense of The Listener and
[28:19] I think listeners are or users more
[28:21] broadly are are frustrated with this and
[28:23] you know they see the opportunity to you
[28:25] know use a podcast app like Fountain
[28:28] which you know we openly say you know we
[28:31] you know we value your time you know the
[28:33] more time you spend listening on
[28:34] Fountain contributing to the community
[28:37] by you know sharing clips and playlists
[28:39] and things like that providing value for
[28:41] other listeners you should be rewarded
[28:43] for that yeah I hope we're going in the
[28:46] kind of the future Direction where it's
[28:49] uh Centric to the users where um the
[28:53] atttention is not sold as you said and
[28:55] that we are having a value for Value
[28:58] economy plus maybe uh brands are making
[29:01] directly deals with the content creators
[29:04] that suit like for example Bitcoin
[29:06] podcast with a Bitcoin Hardware wallet
[29:08] like uh like that's just is with YouTube
[29:11] and also Twitter and also other
[29:13] platforms you just throw ads around the
[29:16] platform that uh is kind of suiting and
[29:19] kind of not suiting depending on how how
[29:21] much data they are gathering and it's
[29:24] like just trading the data trading the
[29:26] attention and uh I think it's great if
[29:28] you have value for Value economy um on
[29:33] the future of content creators I have
[29:35] one more question for you uh I heard it
[29:38] the other day a snippet where they
[29:39] saying like oh it was the first wave
[29:41] with Microsoft and Apple for building
[29:44] the platforms the hardware to to make it
[29:46] possible Then There came the the apps on
[29:48] top of it and it was what the the me
[29:50] next big wave of of companies like
[29:53] Facebook Twitter and all the big social
[29:56] media apps and and Tik Tok and now the
[29:59] the next stage is where content creators
[30:02] are in the center because if you have
[30:04] all the pl um the the outlet where do
[30:08] content creators how does the future for
[30:10] Content creators look like in the ne
[30:12] next 10 20 years can they be the next
[30:15] Googles and Facebook because I see for
[30:18] example Mr Beast like having an amazing
[30:21] great audience beating Netflix with
[30:24] viewership numbers having an amazing
[30:27] economy and Empire around him I mean he
[30:30] is just one example and there like Joe
[30:32] Rog basically is also one one example as
[30:34] you mentioned before where content
[30:36] creators are more and more in the center
[30:38] of those economies and uh they are
[30:41] getting to be all of the sudden billion
[30:43] dollar companies just creating content
[30:46] how do you see that coming the next
[30:49] years yeah it's a good question I think
[30:53] you know an interesting question to
[30:54] think about is what would you be be
[30:57] worth without Mr Beast you know what
[31:00] would spotify's position in podcasting
[31:02] be without Joe Rogan um like you said
[31:05] these businesses have put these creators
[31:07] at the at the heart of their business to
[31:10] um to to drive growth and and to
[31:13] increase their revenues and they're
[31:15] going to have to continue to do that um
[31:18] but the stakes are getting so much
[31:19] higher you know I think creators
[31:21] intuitively know at least the ones on
[31:23] the larger scale that actually they are
[31:24] important and they do have sway over
[31:26] these um kind of policies or kind of
[31:29] features or the way that these apps work
[31:32] and you know that's good in a sense
[31:34] because it it kind of forces these
[31:36] bigger platforms to be more creative
[31:38] focused and I think in being more
[31:40] creative focused that hopefully means
[31:42] that they are um you know relying more
[31:45] on creators for their income instead of
[31:48] advertisers but advertisers are part of
[31:50] this ecosystem as well they're part of
[31:51] the formula um so yeah it very difficult
[31:55] to say um you know I think that I think
[32:00] that value for Value uh is a is a remedy
[32:03] for this um I do think that value for
[32:06] Value maybe uh takes a bit of time to to
[32:09] build the momentum that it needs to be
[32:11] able to challenge some of these bigger
[32:12] platforms and persuade some of the
[32:14] bigger creators to come over um but I
[32:17] think ultimately you know it's it's not
[32:20] a this one or the other one choice you
[32:22] know I think that that's what we're
[32:25] seeing at the moment is creators are
[32:26] existing across multiple platforms at
[32:29] least the ones you know without these
[32:31] kind of exclusivity deals are using
[32:33] multiple platforms and they need to
[32:34] right because they can they can drive
[32:36] reach and they can drive engagement in
[32:38] different ways across different channels
[32:40] um so yeah it's you know going deciding
[32:44] to you know put value for value at the
[32:46] heart of your strategy as a Creator is
[32:48] you know you're not compromising and
[32:49] you're not limiting yourself anywhere
[32:50] else you're just giving yourself another
[32:52] uh Avenue another opportunity to to grow
[32:54] and to learn and it's also like the idea
[32:59] of having a standard A single standard
[33:02] in between and having apps built on that
[33:05] standard and can like being able to
[33:08] follow a Creator wherever you want just
[33:12] having the best client for your
[33:14] experience but the creator has Nostra as
[33:17] the single source of like the protocol
[33:19] layer and can contribute there and can
[33:23] spread it everywhere that's an amazing
[33:25] thing also as a
[33:28] as a perspective from a content creator
[33:30] because I have tools that allow me to
[33:32] spread my content all over and sometimes
[33:35] those tool fail those tools are
[33:37] expensive it would be just way better if
[33:40] there's like one protocol one layer one
[33:43] uh one way to upload it and then it
[33:45] spread all over and the best client wins
[33:48] the the people over uh that would be
[33:50] basically the idea that uh I would love
[33:53] the most um in that sense what what is
[33:57] next for like Fountain and uh for the
[34:01] the great economy on
[34:03] Fountain I think that you know the the
[34:07] top priority for Fountain always has to
[34:09] be focusing on doing the the basics
[34:11] brilliantly well um you know we we have
[34:13] to deliver the fundamentals we can't get
[34:16] ahead of ourselves and um you know kind
[34:19] of get lost in all these new Innovative
[34:21] new features if we can't do the basics
[34:23] right so that's always going to be
[34:24] number one um I think secondly what I
[34:27] mentioned before about you know making
[34:30] value for Value more democratic more
[34:32] accessible for people um almost you know
[34:34] like debitcoin ising it on the front end
[34:38] um so that uh you know it does resonate
[34:40] with a larger audience is great um
[34:42] that's something we're going to continue
[34:43] to do once the you know once the
[34:46] technology is there for us to do it in a
[34:47] compliant way um the other thing too is
[34:51] um yeah just really focusing on that
[34:54] goal of like how can we help podcaster
[34:57] and creators more broadly grow
[34:59] organically um by getting them to really
[35:02] power their content um through their
[35:04] Community through their fans um so
[35:07] building more tools and features that
[35:09] allow that organic growth to happen um
[35:12] and I think the last thing as well is
[35:14] looking at how value for Value can be
[35:16] applied to uh other uh mediums so you
[35:20] know we've not been quiet about Our
[35:22] intention to go into audio books um I
[35:24] think that audio books are you know an
[35:27] area where it's kind of uh ripe for
[35:31] Innovation uh if you look at what
[35:33] audible is doing what other kind of
[35:35] audiobook um apps providers are doing is
[35:39] quite limiting um again they have like a
[35:42] very utilitarian purpose where you go
[35:45] onto audible you buy your audiobook you
[35:47] listen to it and then you close the app
[35:49] there's no kind of Engagement there's no
[35:52] social sharing there's no community and
[35:55] there's just kind of I guess no Spirit
[35:57] at all to it and we want to change that
[36:00] we've kind of already started that
[36:02] process with podcasting and we're seeing
[36:03] that start to happen now podcasting is
[36:06] like you know started to come alive
[36:08] through through what we're doing or at
[36:09] least we hope so and yeah we want to
[36:11] apply that to audio books and
[36:13] potentially other mediums in the future
[36:14] too a that's great uh before we go uh to
[36:18] our end routine um what's your take on
[36:20] Bitcoin in like the next few years uh do
[36:23] how do you see the Bitcoin ETF playing
[36:25] into the role do you see uh Bitcoin
[36:29] adoption growing do you see any uh uh
[36:33] countries following El Salvador what's
[36:36] your general take on the future of
[36:38] Bitcoin in like the near-term five
[36:42] years yeah so I think that the the ECF
[36:45] is is you know it's a good thing for
[36:47] Bitcoin um I think we maybe over
[36:50] anticipated the shortterm impact of the
[36:52] ETF particularly when looking at price
[36:54] but obviously price is not everything
[36:57] um I think as well like as we kind of
[36:59] come towards the harving in uh you know
[37:01] spring this year we should also see that
[37:04] kind of upward price momentum but again
[37:06] price is not everything I think actually
[37:07] the best advert for Bitcoin is is
[37:10] adoption of Bitcoin by nation states
[37:12] like El Salvador so I think if there's
[37:14] other you know countries who are going
[37:16] to follow their lead um you know that is
[37:19] brilliant for really uh authenticating
[37:22] Bitcoin um in in a way that price can't
[37:25] or an ETF can't right
[37:27] um so yeah that that's my hope that's
[37:29] what I hope to see and there are
[37:31] obviously economies around the world who
[37:33] are in desperate need for Bitcoin we
[37:34] know that very well um so yeah that that
[37:38] would be my hope um but yeah I think you
[37:41] know more broadly you know thinking
[37:43] about you know adoption of Bitcoin
[37:45] lightning this is also something that we
[37:47] hope to see uh spread rapidly and of
[37:50] course you know um you know nation
[37:53] states adopting Bitcoin as a standard
[37:55] has a massive impact on adoption of
[37:57] lightning too you know we've seen that
[37:58] in El Salvador if you look at like the
[38:00] number of like transactions or like
[38:02] adoptions on uh adoption of uh lightning
[38:05] wallets and the volume of payments uh in
[38:07] that time it it spiked massively and um
[38:11] you know that's that's definitely a
[38:12] great thing um and I I also just think
[38:14] that you know hopefully there are going
[38:16] to be more big companies that build
[38:19] Bitcoin into their strategy um I'm
[38:21] personally a massive fan of what cash
[38:23] app are doing because they ultimately
[38:24] have you know a money app which is you
[38:27] know is really built on bitcoin but uh
[38:30] you know is is not necessarily um you
[38:33] know you might not think that you might
[38:35] be using cash app but not as you know
[38:37] not using it for its Bitcoin properties
[38:39] at all but you know you also have the
[38:41] option to kind of make payments um over
[38:43] the Bitcoin lightning Network you know
[38:45] which is amazing there's layers to that
[38:47] product that I think people will
[38:49] discover over time and uh yeah I hope we
[38:52] see more of that in in the world of tech
[38:55] oh great um we have an end routine in
[38:59] the podcast where the previous guest
[39:00] asked a question for the next guest uh
[39:03] and it's it's it's an interesting one I
[39:06] could not even uh answer it myself
[39:10] uh what what would make the central
[39:13] banks sell gold and buy Bitcoin yeah
[39:17] it's a big question um it's a big
[39:21] question yeah I don't know it's very
[39:24] difficult one to answer I think um
[39:28] um yeah I'm kind of stuck on that I mean
[39:31] the the bigger thing is also when when
[39:34] when central banks realize oh
[39:37] Bitcoin is so coming that they realize
[39:40] they have to sell gold and and have to
[39:42] buy Bitcoin it's kind of are they really
[39:44] giving up control because why do we need
[39:46] a central bank if if we have a Bitcoin
[39:50] standard in that sense it's also an
[39:52] interesting question as it's the the
[39:55] background is it comes from a previous
[39:57] guest and but that time the the episode
[39:59] will already be out and he is also big
[40:03] gold guy like he's a gold and Bitcoin
[40:07] and we had some some debates and I asked
[40:10] him in the end what would what would
[40:12] make you go Bitcoin only and sell all
[40:15] your gold and he said if central banks
[40:18] uh start selling gold in buying Bitcoin
[40:22] uh and then he gave the questions to to
[40:24] the next guest like what
[40:27] what needs to happen in order to for
[40:29] that to to to to happen but I like
[40:32] that's that's an interesting question to
[40:34] think about but in in in some sense if
[40:38] Bitcoin is really s money it will come
[40:40] eventually I think but yeah let's
[40:43] see um where can people find you the
[40:46] best uh where can people get in touch
[40:48] with
