[00:00] why do we benefit so much when we focus
[00:02] on bitcoin and Bitcoin only no stocks no
[00:06] cryptos altcoins no real estate nothing
[00:09] else like that we focus completely and
[00:12] only on bitcoin and why do we actually
[00:15] really benefit from that why isn't it a
[00:18] good idea to diversify your time and
[00:20] your financial energy maybe the stocks
[00:23] maybe the real estate maybe do I don't
[00:25] know Solana ethereum or any other
[00:27] altcoin out there and that's what it
[00:29] really got into with Danny She
[00:31] interviewed me a few months back where I
[00:33] was at my old studio and I hope you
[00:35] enjoy this interview where Danny was an
[00:38] amazing host and you hopefully get some
[00:41] value out of this let me know what you
[00:43] think in the comment section don't
[00:44] forget to like don't forget to subscribe
[00:47] let's get to
[00:51] it welcome to the heartbit podcast where
[00:54] we delve into the heart of Bitcoin and
[00:56] uncover the sweet sport for enthusiast
[00:58] worldwide I'm Danny your fellow Bitcoin
[01:01] Explorer and today we will be joined by
[01:04] Robin sire a Bitcoin podcast host who
[01:08] has been in the scene for quite a while
[01:10] now he's had an opportunity to interview
[01:12] a lot of people and today we're going to
[01:14] talk with him a little bit about his
[01:16] journey how are you hi Dan I'm I'm
[01:20] really really good it's it's it's
[01:22] amazing to be on the other side like I
[01:23] have a daily Bitcoin podcast show as you
[01:26] mentioned and I usually interview every
[01:29] day tomorrow I have a weird schedule
[01:31] with three podcasts in a row with like
[01:33] half an hour in between so this will be
[01:36] Challen challenging for me uh but
[01:38] usually like uh I'm doing every day a
[01:40] podcast interview and I have people on
[01:42] from like uh Jeff Bo Natalie Brunell
[01:45] even Gary adone recently uh the the the
[01:48] bigger guys on on on social media but
[01:51] also the everyday kind of a guy like
[01:54] just like if if someone replies to my
[01:56] tweet and I'm like oh that's an
[01:57] interesting reply uh I just I don't do a
[02:00] lot of checking I'm like dming him like
[02:02] hey do you want to be on my show let's
[02:04] record and this these are usually the
[02:06] the episodes that I love the most
[02:07] because there I get to know someone new
[02:10] there I get to know someone that is not
[02:13] the not not on every podcast because
[02:16] like a jef boof Michel sa Natalie
[02:18] Brunell they on every podcast and I
[02:20] heard them like 20 30 times uh saying
[02:24] Bitcoin stuff and so I love to have the
[02:27] new guys the someone that was ever on a
[02:30] podcast I had I think I made now 106
[02:35] episodes uh and I think 10 or 15 of of
[02:38] those were the first time ever on a
[02:41] podcast with me so this is really really
[02:43] cool to have have completely new faces
[02:46] in the Bitcoin Community to have to
[02:47] spread the world a little bit further
[02:50] that's really interesting you mentioned
[02:52] that because uh over the weekend I was
[02:54] thinking that I was interested in
[02:57] interviewing people who maybe don't know
[02:59] know that much about bitcoiner Bitcoin
[03:01] like the actual users to get a better
[03:04] sense of where people get lost where
[03:06] people get
[03:07] apprehension and kind of like to
[03:10] basically orange pill people on
[03:13] camera and and you have to get them as
[03:16] and and when you explain Bitcoin like if
[03:19] you get Bitcoin explained by someone you
[03:22] want someone that is relatable to you uh
[03:25] and this is where we have to get really
[03:28] diverse with with our uh with our guests
[03:31] uh if we if we have someone sitting in
[03:34] India uh someone that is Indian and
[03:38] explains in Bitcoin is way better and
[03:41] way more relatable as some American
[03:44] guy definely so like I I'm trying to
[03:47] just have the widest range of of of of
[03:50] uh people on my Bitcoin uh show that is
[03:53] is possible I cannot do more than one a
[03:56] day like one a day is my my upper limit
[03:59] uh it's maybe maybe too much but uh I'm
[04:02] trying to keep up with the schedule that
[04:04] I set myself uh but it's a really really
[04:07] cool thing to do yeah and we we need
[04:09] more people in the Bitcoin uh scene like
[04:12] we are so so small and so early uh
[04:14] everyone that starts a podcast everyone
[04:17] that starts speaking about it everyone
[04:19] every voice is so important that speaks
[04:22] up earlier you said 106 episodes but
[04:26] this morning I was looking at your
[04:27] YouTube again and it said exactly 100
[04:30] episodes I was wondering if maybe some
[04:32] have not become available but because of
[04:36] that I was uh thinking of celebrating
[04:38] this as like your 100 episode retrospect
[04:42] since it like kind of coincided and with
[04:45] like you being interviewed there there's
[04:48] two aspects to it first of all like I
[04:50] pre-record stuff uh so like I have
[04:53] episodes that are not have been uploaded
[04:56] till now but there is also the aspect
[04:59] where I already deleted two episodes uh
[05:03] which is not because of me it's just
[05:06] because they said oh they don't want it
[05:08] anymore uh someone said it uh right
[05:12] after I released it and then I just took
[05:14] it off uh because he said he's involved
[05:17] in investment stuff and in investment
[05:19] series and he doesn't want to have any
[05:22] thing that gets in the way of getting an
[05:24] investment right now um I don't like if
[05:27] someone says like delete my episodes I'm
[05:29] the leading of course like I don't I
[05:31] don't care like the the the my shows are
[05:33] for the guest uh and someone uh was
[05:37] wanted to delete it because he wants to
[05:39] be more private uh and I respect that
[05:42] decision and uh it's it's it's totally
[05:44] fine I mean the the later one was on for
[05:47] like a few months so I I looked at the
[05:50] statistics this episode did not get any
[05:51] Fusion last week anyway so but uh still
[05:55] like I respect this uh so there could be
[05:57] a a difference there uh but the bigger
[06:00] difference is because I pre record and
[06:04] pre-record everything uh and then
[06:07] release it like a week later two weeks
[06:09] later a few days later depending on on
[06:12] how far I'm ahead in the schedule and
[06:14] yeah I I released my 100th
[06:17] episode I think on Saturday uh so today
[06:21] was my 1002nd release or 100 first
[06:24] release something like that so we we can
[06:26] definitely make a 100 episode retrospect
[06:28] because we are right around the the 100
[06:30] episodes right now yeah I think it's
[06:32] still a great opportunity to celebrate
[06:34] the 100 episodes and like the trajectory
[06:36] and the path like the things you have
[06:38] learned and what you've discovered on
[06:40] the way so I have a couple questions
[06:43] related to that the first question I had
[06:45] is who has taught you the the most in
[06:48] these 100 episode who taught you the
[06:53] most uh wow that's uh that's really hard
[06:57] to pinpoint uh
[07:01] there there are uh a lot of different uh
[07:05] that that learned me a lot um I think
[07:09] Jeff Bo was the most influential on my
[07:11] life honestly uh because uh I
[07:14] interviewed him in a very interesting
[07:16] point in my life where I just was in the
[07:20] in the transition uh to being from
[07:23] parttime working in in uh sales for an
[07:27] IT company and doing part-time the
[07:29] podcast to going full time to podcast
[07:32] and doing only this uh and he said like
[07:36] I I did not speak with him about that
[07:39] but he just said in the end of the
[07:40] podcast even like live while we were
[07:43] recording he said that
[07:46] um you benefit massively if you spend
[07:50] all your time right now in Bitcoin not
[07:53] only your financial energy but also your
[07:56] time in Bitcoin uh and he explained your
[07:59] himself that he even though he was
[08:02] invested in Bitcoin he spent all this
[08:05] time with this feared system money and
[08:08] stuff like that in the field system
[08:10] where he was involved and he one time
[08:12] stood up and was like I'm I'm like
[08:15] benefiting the Fiat system he speaking
[08:17] about Bitcoin he had the book already
[08:19] out but he was not really outspoken uh
[08:23] um not really spending his time in
[08:26] Bitcoin and then he decided to do the
[08:28] the what is it called ego def Capital uh
[08:32] and spending his time really on uh
[08:35] Bitcoin uh and this kind of uh was one
[08:38] of
[08:39] the major reasons why I also like took
[08:43] the step like there are a lot of reasons
[08:45] why I took the step and I wanted to took
[08:47] the step take the step this year I had
[08:50] it planned way later like I wanted to do
[08:52] it like September October at this range
[08:55] but I ended up doing it already in
[08:58] February uh which was a surprise to me
[09:01] because things were just happening way
[09:04] faster than than I expected this is also
[09:06] part to 21 Bitcoin believing in me and
[09:09] sponsoring me really early on um making
[09:12] it happen for me the transition so I
[09:15] think uh this was uh I think I didn't
[09:18] learn the much um the most from Jeff
[09:21] poof uh but from Jeff poof the had the
[09:25] most influence on my life maybe um the
[09:28] most learnings I think I this is this is
[09:32] really hard to pinpoint it's a really
[09:33] good question I didn't thought about it
[09:36] and actually um I'm planning on doing a
[09:39] book on on my podcast episodes because
[09:41] I'm interviewing so many people uh a
[09:43] book that is like what Bitcoin taught me
[09:46] uh where I also uh have the learnings
[09:49] from my guests in uh so if I started
[09:52] with the book I probably had a better
[09:53] answer already but this is this is an an
[09:56] interesting uh thought about
[10:00] yeah I have a question that is similar
[10:03] but I was curious if you would say the
[10:05] same person or not because the other
[10:07] question I had is who surprised you the
[10:10] most or who or what surprised you the
[10:13] most who gave you the piece of
[10:14] information that was like the most the
[10:17] most unexpected or who came on your show
[10:20] and was the most
[10:23] unexpected those are definitely this is
[10:25] definitely not Jeff poof because I knew
[10:27] him before quite good and and uh this is
[10:30] what I was talking a little bit earlier
[10:33] because the the bigger guys you already
[10:35] know what they're saying like when you
[10:38] ask Jeff poof a question you kind of
[10:40] know where he's going like what he's
[10:42] saying and stuff like this because he's
[10:44] he's on so many podcasts um but one that
[10:49] was really fascinating for me was Luke
[10:52] that I interviewed recently as a
[10:54] basketball uh player professional one uh
[10:58] and uh he was just really good in
[11:02] speaking about Bitcoin and about his
[11:04] passion and it was his first podcast it
[11:06] was fascinating for me because if you
[11:08] interview people that are the first time
[11:10] on a podcast uh it's also a little bit
[11:13] uh like like a gamble because they could
[11:17] be really nervous they could be really
[11:20] um yeah it's the first time maybe
[11:22] they're not uh um not as good in
[11:26] articulating uh things uh as might be
[11:30] like a Michael saor Jeff Po and stuff
[11:31] like that uh so it's a little bit of a
[11:34] gamble so the host like me has to do
[11:37] more work on making them comfortable uh
[11:40] if someone is completely new I usually
[11:42] spend more time before the podcast like
[11:45] 10 15 something in 20 minutes speaking
[11:47] with them uh and then just starting the
[11:49] recording and and keeping really
[11:51] friendly uh with Jeff po I like yeah
[11:54] he's in press record let's
[11:57] go like definitely taking notes from
[12:00] your
[12:02] techniques yes I think a host uh has the
[12:06] the job of of getting the best out of
[12:08] the guest like this is uh like get get
[12:11] getting um like it's not it's it's easy
[12:14] to get the best out of like a really
[12:16] good speaker because he's prepared like
[12:18] he did it so many times he know what he
[12:20] is doing uh he he already said the
[12:23] things he want to say like 50 times
[12:26] before he he says it's on the podcast or
[12:28] maybe like hundred times uh and someone
[12:31] that is new like I had one guy on uh
[12:34] that I will not say his name but uh he
[12:37] was on and we took two uh two sets like
[12:41] we we did did the podcast like 30 hours
[12:45] 30 minutes half an hour and then we said
[12:48] okay let's delete it uh let's do the
[12:50] same thing just over again and then we
[12:53] did 45 minutes and it was actually a
[12:55] really good performing podcast because
[12:57] he had extremely good things to say and
[13:00] I was loving his opinion uh and uh it
[13:04] was it was amazing to see when when
[13:07] people are coming over this this hurdle
[13:10] of oh I can actually freely speak I can
[13:13] that that's what in my that's what in my
[13:15] what is in my mind I can actually
[13:17] pronounce and put it into the world and
[13:19] it is something that resonates with
[13:21] people and every episode is resonating
[13:24] with other people like sometimes I think
[13:26] like oh this episode is not as
[13:27] interesting and then it performs really
[13:30] good because I'm just one person maybe
[13:33] the the the episode or the guest was not
[13:36] as interesting for me personally but it
[13:38] could be really interesting for someone
[13:40] listening uh so I don't try to judge my
[13:44] my my own episodes or my own guests and
[13:47] I just try to uh do like one hour of of
[13:51] pre uh um preparation before the guest
[13:55] comes on so I'm prepared uh what his
[13:58] life is about what he's doing obviously
[14:01] with people that are more on the
[14:03] Internet it's easier because you find
[14:04] stuff if if someone is not active then
[14:06] it's really hard to find stuff and he
[14:09] only has 200 followers and he is not
[14:12] doing a lot but even those I have on and
[14:15] those are the the most cool the most
[14:17] amazing episodes usually as as with Luke
[14:21] it's not released until now but probably
[14:23] when this is released it will be
[14:25] released uh so it was really really cool
[14:28] to just like talk with with random
[14:29] people uh and and yeah get the get the
[14:33] interesting the new uh point of views of
[14:36] of Bitcoin out yeah because I do feel
[14:39] like there's been a shift in society
[14:42] because before like uh it would maybe be
[14:45] uncomfortable to talk about Bitcoin in
[14:47] certain social environments or if you
[14:49] brought it up they make all those memo
[14:51] about bringing it up at The Family Table
[14:53] and all that stuff but like now I feel
[14:57] it's like uh even in my own on social
[14:59] environment I'm okay talking about
[15:02] Bitcoin talking about working in Bitcoin
[15:04] because everything has become more like
[15:05] formal and it's becoming normalized
[15:08] every day more we are growing up this is
[15:11] this is the thing that uh we we I see
[15:13] more and more in the Bitcoin world we
[15:15] are actually growing up and the Bitcoin
[15:17] Community is now ready to be in all the
[15:21] get togethers in all the restaurant
[15:24] discussions and all the bar discussions
[15:26] like everybody knows Bitcoin and those
[15:30] FS that we usually have to deal with
[15:32] they are getting smaller like the the
[15:34] environment fud is at least in my austan
[15:37] environment is still big but it gets
[15:39] smaller and people are like oh yes it
[15:41] uses a lot of energy but people are like
[15:43] kind of yeah we have to deal with it uh
[15:45] but it's like they don't understand why
[15:47] Bitcoin is useful so they still have
[15:49] those those Fs in their in their head
[15:52] but it it gets better like it gets way
[15:54] better and also when I see it in the
[15:56] family when I first adopted it in four
[15:59] four years ago I was the only one in in
[16:03] Bitcoin I was the only weird one in in
[16:05] in Bitcoin and it was for the family
[16:08] totally okay and they knew it because I
[16:09] was only the also the only one that was
[16:11] investing in stocks that were unusual uh
[16:15] and I always put like big bets on on
[16:18] stocks I had a lot of uh money uh like
[16:22] lot of my money not a lot of money but a
[16:25] lot of like a high percentage of my
[16:27] money in Tesla stock uh before I had it
[16:30] in Bitcoin uh so they they were like oh
[16:34] Robin he is like having really high risk
[16:37] stocks and really high risk bets which I
[16:40] always disagreed with but with Tesla the
[16:43] kind uh what right I mean I made a a
[16:47] huge amount of money because I was lucky
[16:50] honestly because I did not really
[16:52] understand the stock market back then uh
[16:54] but this pushed me to bitcoin uh and
[16:59] yeah so like my my environment reacted
[17:02] really good to bitcoin like nobody like
[17:05] was like Bitcoin uh but uh this is also
[17:08] like this is a point where I'm also um
[17:11] I'm always really healthy I'm trying to
[17:14] to look out for myself uh and so I'm I'm
[17:18] looked up to in in my family sometimes
[17:21] uh and this is where I'm really
[17:23] passionate about like when you are um in
[17:26] in your life really good like you are
[17:29] kind and nice to everyone and you're
[17:31] happy with your life and you're doing
[17:33] good this is the best orange building
[17:35] you can do people uh driving towards you
[17:38] like if if you are just doing really
[17:40] good in life you're happy you're giving
[17:41] to society you're a kind nice person and
[17:44] then you are also the bitcoiner then
[17:47] they're not as ah this Bitcoin thing and
[17:50] they they're kind of lowering their
[17:52] barriers and they're more open to the
[17:55] idea of it and that's why I'm like when
[17:57] someone ask me what's the best Orange
[17:59] Building uh strategy be really good in
[18:03] life be kind be the be the Town Hero The
[18:06] Village
[18:07] Hero like whatever you're doing try to
[18:11] give back to people uh live healthy work
[18:15] out uh look like you're a healthy happy
[18:19] human being and be a healthy happy human
[18:22] being uh and I'm trying my best to be uh
[18:25] that person I'm not always perfect but
[18:28] I'm I'm trying to do it and I think
[18:30] people notice that like people realize
[18:32] that oh he's he's actually genuinely
[18:35] happy or not like if if people are happy
[18:37] they they notice that and that's the
[18:39] best orange building because when then
[18:41] Bitcoin comes up in their head and they
[18:43] are curious about it uh they are taking
[18:46] your advice seriously if you are um U
[18:51] not good in your life you're like in
[18:52] another good of place on on in your life
[18:55] they're not as um open or welcoming your
[19:00] your um opinion even though the opinion
[19:03] is as as valid from as from any other
[19:06] person no I I hear what you're saying
[19:09] because I was basically debating with
[19:11] the same idea recently which is that you
[19:14] know the best way to like for I'm a very
[19:18] private person so it's difficult for me
[19:20] to like to create this show was a big
[19:24] like personal obstacle for me to like
[19:27] commit to being in the public guy and
[19:30] with that also comes like the the the
[19:33] more I would like like the more I share
[19:37] my lifestyle with the community the more
[19:40] clear like I could be sharing those
[19:43] Concepts but it's a huge struggle for me
[19:46] like how much do you reveal of
[19:48] yourself and how much do you keep
[19:51] private but at the same time like if you
[19:54] reveal because there's also that whole
[19:56] thing because in social media like
[19:58] there's so much like sharing and envy I
[20:01] don't like how like to create fomo in
[20:04] other people that causes me unrest but
[20:08] what you're talking about is so much
[20:10] more elegant because it's it's like the
[20:12] same ideas that I was debating but it's
[20:15] not about the jealousy and the Envy it's
[20:17] about like you are po you are like you
[20:20] have a high quality of life which like
[20:23] reaffirms that Bitcoin is a good thing
[20:26] for yourself and for society because it
[20:29] allows you to have a happy stable like
[20:32] long-term pref long time preference calm
[20:36] life yeah
[20:39] definitely so I like how you worded it
[20:41] because I was really struggling with
[20:43] this concept the last couple of
[20:46] weeks and and people love it when you
[20:49] share your life by the way like this off
[20:51] topic but as you mentioned it like um if
[20:55] if if you share stuff on your podcast
[20:57] and I in the First episodes I did not
[21:00] share a lot about me but I tried to
[21:03] share more more about my story also uh I
[21:05] mean I always um make the episodes about
[21:10] my guests but sometimes it's uh really
[21:12] cool to like get in some some personal
[21:15] stories and get in like I have people
[21:18] watch my episode every day uh and they
[21:22] are curious about the guests of course
[21:24] but they are um really also curious
[21:28] about myself so uh if if you share small
[21:32] stories of yourself like I shared a lot
[21:34] that I'm a swimmer I shared a lot about
[21:36] that I shared a lot about my personal uh
[21:39] investment uh Story how uh I did also
[21:43] shitcoins and then came back to bitcoin
[21:45] only I shared some of those stories and
[21:49] this is the stuff that actually people
[21:51] remember and I had people on that watch
[21:54] also a lot of my podcasts before uh
[21:57] those people that are the first time on
[21:59] a podcast uh they wanted to prepare
[22:02] themselves and they like Watch the
[22:03] episodes and when I went with them on
[22:07] the podcast then for example as with L
[22:10] or with other people um I had the
[22:13] feeling that I already best friends with
[22:16] them because they knew so much about me
[22:19] and it felt it's it's it's um sharing
[22:23] stuff online um like for me it's like
[22:26] you have to make either decision either
[22:28] you compl completely off grid your your
[22:30] face is not shown you you you don't show
[22:32] yourself um or you're online uh once
[22:35] you're online you you people will know
[22:38] you people if if someone wants to find
[22:40] out who's stany and is she related to
[22:43] bitcoin they are now able to do it
[22:46] because you put yourself out there and
[22:48] then I always recommend like share what
[22:50] you're comfortable sharing uh and the
[22:53] more you share uh the the better or uh
[22:56] relationship you can make with your um
[23:00] yeah viewers because it's like with with
[23:02] in real life also like if you have
[23:04] friends uh the best friends know the
[23:07] most of you because you shared the most
[23:09] with with you with them and it's it's
[23:11] the same way in in uh in in social media
[23:15] the only important thing with that is
[23:18] you have to set like your like complete
[23:20] boundaries where like okay this is where
[23:23] I'm not talking about um um stuff like
[23:26] that for example I I talk a lot about uh
[23:29] my girlfriend also in in the podcast
[23:31] show but I never share her name I never
[23:33] share other stuff about her uh because I
[23:36] want to respect her privacy uh and even
[23:40] though she's herself online she has more
[23:43] YouTube subscribers than
[23:44] me but but uh I don't want to talk her I
[23:49] don't want to uh make this connection uh
[23:52] so I just talk my girlfriend so there
[23:55] need to to say her name so like is there
[23:57] is uh things where you just have to be
[24:00] like okay these are the things that I
[24:01] want to keep private this is what I not
[24:03] want to share and the rest I'm open and
[24:06] I'm I'm I'm feeling like I this is up to
[24:09] you how you do it but this is how how I
[24:11] done it and I think uh having having
[24:14] this distance remote relationship with
[24:17] the viewers is really cool uh and I get
[24:20] the comments section I love because they
[24:23] getting better and better because the
[24:25] relationship is getting better and
[24:26] better besides the few scam comments
[24:29] that I have to delete all every day I
[24:31] think there's some I don't even know the
[24:34] names there some am something token
[24:37] going on that I have to delad now I'm
[24:40] uploading a video first five minutes I
[24:42] have 30 comments of of that's spot bot
[24:45] things uh it's it's it's quite annoying
[24:48] but I I try to keep my comment sections
[24:51] clean yeah used to work for Tony V and
[24:55] the spammers are always commenting
[24:57] eventually
[24:59] we gave up on like uh micromanaging all
[25:02] the scams because it was like every week
[25:06] it was a different coin and a different
[25:08] scammer I did I did actually end up
[25:10] writing a code for a bot to help manage
[25:13] the comments I have it time somewhere so
[25:16] if one day you need it I will hook you
[25:18] up with
[25:20] it I mean in the end it would have it
[25:23] would be the job of Twitter Youtube to
[25:25] deal with the stuff yes
[25:28] I feel like on Twitter even though I
[25:30] have the more followings and they get
[25:33] more comments there it's better I feel
[25:36] like I don't get a lot of it maybe I'm
[25:38] not seeing it I don't know I have I have
[25:39] a quality filter in in
[25:42] Twitter activated so maybe in twiter
[25:44] it's better but in YouTube I I activated
[25:47] that I see all the comments uh so like
[25:50] it's it's weird but yeah definitely I
[25:53] I'm I'm I'm really passionate about
[25:54] sharing my my stuff online I'm also
[25:56] seeing like the podcast that I do now uh
[25:59] is not a short-term thing like I will do
[26:02] my podcast till till I die because it's
[26:06] it's fascinating for me to having this
[26:09] uh out out this yeah this this
[26:14] broadcasting of my current uh beliefs of
[26:19] my current uh friends and and and
[26:21] circles that I have uh and document it I
[26:25] see it also uh this this I saw it in a
[26:28] random speech and this resonated a lot
[26:30] with me has nothing to do with Bitcoin
[26:32] by the way but this resonated a lot with
[26:33] me um the he said like he's really
[26:37] passionate about content created
[26:39] creation because he thinks about his
[26:41] Grand grandson that is now able to watch
[26:45] his his grand grand grand Grandpa uh how
[26:48] he was in life what he did what he uh he
[26:52] did and and stuff like that and this is
[26:53] something where I'm like this is really
[26:55] cool how much money would I give to see
[26:58] my grand grand Grandpa not only on a
[27:01] picture like how how amazing would be to
[27:04] have like two hours of podcast with him
[27:06] where he explained His World Views this
[27:08] would be something I would actually pay
[27:10] a lot of money to get uh and uh putting
[27:13] this out and and showing if if a grand
[27:15] grand grand grand grandson is interested
[27:17] in it he can look look at it that's
[27:20] amazing well I I already have a daughter
[27:23] so I can resonate very much with your
[27:25] idea I have more questions about the
[27:27] actual hand episodes but I do want to
[27:30] talk about like since we're on the
[27:31] personal ground I wanted to talk about
[27:33] that a little bit more like where do you
[27:35] live do you go to your local conferences
[27:38] do you interact with the community in
[27:39] like real life what what how do you feel
[27:42] about that stuff I'm trying to be more
[27:46] uh physical involved also in Bitcoin if
[27:49] if I can say it like that um I was last
[27:52] year in Prague and will be this year in
[27:53] Prague Prague is amazing because it's
[27:55] such a huge conference so everybody is
[27:58] there everybody that is really involved
[28:00] in Bitcoin will be there I'm also moving
[28:03] to Vienna uh I'm probably going to um
[28:07] meetups also there uh right now I'm
[28:10] close like one two hours away from
[28:12] Vienna in a smaller City uh which I have
[28:16] not been to any meetups there are
[28:18] meetups some uh time but not a lot and
[28:21] every time it was I did not have time uh
[28:24] so it was like a weird weird thing uh
[28:27] and I was I'm only one year now here and
[28:30] before I was in Munich in Munich I was
[28:32] also at some meetups which I love
[28:35] honestly um getting to know uh
[28:37] bitcoiners like actually in person it's
[28:40] a different feeling I always encourage
[28:42] everybody to go to conferences if you
[28:44] never have been to a conference or
[28:46] Meetup go to some something like that
[28:48] maybe start with a local Meetup there
[28:51] is no matter where you live uh in like
[28:55] one two hours uh reach there some
[28:58] Bitcoin Meetup if you look it up like
[29:01] there like I don't know if there's any
[29:03] place on the world where there's no
[29:06] Bitcoin Meetup in not two hours range or
[29:09] something
[29:11] like you probably find it somehow uh so
[29:15] I encourage everybody to to go to
[29:17] bitcoin meetups to local meetups and
[29:19] meet people there and then uh if you're
[29:22] ready go to a Bitcoin PR conference uh
[29:24] it can be uh intimidating if there like
[29:27] 8,000 people there
[29:28] but 8,000 people is also good because
[29:30] nobody will notice you anyways like you
[29:32] can go in there and be basically a ghost
[29:35] because if nobody knows you you you you
[29:37] will be unnoticed because there are so
[29:38] many faces around so you can really go
[29:41] to the booths uh check out the companies
[29:43] uh you can meet uh people I got a
[29:46] picture with marichel saor and sa Mo on
[29:48] the same picture with me which looks
[29:51] hilarious because I'm 2 meters and
[29:53] Michael saor is small and cerine is even
[29:56] smaller than him which which looks like
[29:58] kind of like that
[30:00] uh uh so I'm I'm loving this this this
[30:04] uh picture uh so we meet Jimmy song
[30:08] Jimmy song is super tall he doesn't look
[30:11] it but super
[30:12] tall I I've never met Jimmy song in in
[30:16] in real life I think I don't know if he
[30:19] he was not at Bitcoin prag last year or
[30:21] I just missed him uh but I he's tall you
[30:25] say yeah so you get the opposite effect
[30:29] when you take a photo well will be
[30:32] even so so the next I I do agree with
[30:35] the conferences one thing that also
[30:37] happens is that you'll be in you you can
[30:39] be a ghost but also you'll find other
[30:42] people who will be open to talking to
[30:43] you and what you will quickly discover
[30:45] is that most bitcoiners have gone on
[30:47] very similar Journeys like you discover
[30:50] it you go shitcoin for a little bit
[30:52] while you like find your pudding and
[30:56] then when you start like maturing and
[30:57] real realizing what this really is about
[31:00] then you you stop participating in all
[31:03] the scams and all the money Printing and
[31:06] you focus your energy back on bitcoin it
[31:08] just takes a moment to like take to make
[31:10] that realization that's why I think that
[31:12] they do the Hing graduations like what
[31:15] gen like what um uh graduation you're
[31:18] from because you have to kind of go
[31:20] through a haling to really become a
[31:23] maximalist unless you're extremely smart
[31:26] you have to go through like these little
[31:27] journey
[31:29] it's fascinating to see michor because
[31:31] he has been from the beginning Bitcoin
[31:35] like once he got Bitcoin he uh never
[31:39] looked at any altcoins he probably
[31:41] looked at altcoins but privately and he
[31:44] researched about it I'm 100% certain
[31:46] like it's it's fascinating for me how
[31:49] how amazingly he entered the the space
[31:52] because most do some alt coining you
[31:54] also see it with Gary Cardone right now
[31:56] I interviewed him and he is definitely a
[31:59] Bitcoin Maxi like when you talk with him
[32:02] his mindset that's a Bitcoin Maxi
[32:04] mindset that just did not discover the
[32:06] Bitcoin Maxi thing uh so he will be I
[32:08] think right there where he is but he did
[32:11] the interview with the gadano guy I
[32:14] think was a Lana I think one of the two
[32:17] things I I don't even know which which
[32:19] shitcoin he was
[32:23] on I had a question under these lines
[32:26] which was like would you ever bring on
[32:27] the show to interview like your enemies
[32:30] in the sense of like keeping your
[32:32] enemies close or learning what they're
[32:33] thinking about or would you like trying
[32:36] to strive away from diverging
[32:39] opinions um I have a close friend in
[32:42] Munich that begs me always to bring some
[32:46]  going on and I I'm always saying I
[32:50] am curious about stuff but I don't want
[32:53] to promote um scams and for me all the
[32:59] altcoins uh are in some sense a scam um
[33:04] maybe they are not intended as a scam
[33:05] maybe they don't want to scam people
[33:07] they just like really want to improve on
[33:09] something and they really think there's
[33:11] utility value and innovation in in there
[33:14] uh but in the end of the day I think
[33:16] there is no real value um I could be
[33:20] wrong honestly I'm I'm I'm I'm getting
[33:23] through my podcast I actually am more
[33:26] open uh and more more free market
[33:29] maximalist than than saying more toxic
[33:33] stuff because I'm thinking like okay
[33:35] there is like someone pays millions of
[33:38] dollars for some picture I don't get it
[33:40] like I don't get art like why someone is
[33:42] paying so 16 Bitcoin for the buy Bitcoin
[33:47] sign are you talking about
[33:49] thein 16
[33:51] Bitcoin this
[33:53] is yeah this is what I also don't get
[33:56] but um I'm a free market maximalist
[34:00] where I'm like if someone pays a price
[34:02] for that it's okay like if like I would
[34:05] not do it I would not recommend it uh
[34:08] but if someone does it it's okay like
[34:11] the the if if if nobody was forced to do
[34:14] it or nobody was lied to uh this is
[34:17] where uh most altcoins fail when I see
[34:21] their website and they're like oh we is
[34:23] at this
[34:24] decentralized uh ding ding ding ding
[34:26] ding no no you're not you're not
[34:28] decentralized there's one person that
[34:30] can alter the the protocol there's one
[34:32] point even with etherium there's vitalic
[34:35] that truly owns and controls this whole
[34:39] thing he can uh get the thing from proof
[34:42] of work to proof of stake he can reverse
[34:44] transactions he he clearly is in control
[34:46] of the protocol there's no question
[34:49] about it but they're like oh we are
[34:51] decentralizing apps no you're like uh uh
[34:55] not decentralized you're decentral more
[34:57] centralized and a centralized database
[35:00] but there is a single point of failure
[35:02] that's a company what you running and
[35:05] this is where I have most of my problems
[35:08] but I also had people on um the gold guy
[35:12] not Peter Shi but someone similar to him
[35:16] but uh someone that has actually Bitcoin
[35:19] but he only has like five or 10% of of
[35:22] of Bitcoin and the rest is in Gold uh
[35:25] and and he was really
[35:28] also good about altcoins and shitcoins
[35:31] uh he was like they have some value uh
[35:35] and also he was like Goldie Superior and
[35:37] stuff like that he but he admitted in
[35:39] the end of the podcast that it's very
[35:41] likely that Bitcoin is outperforming
[35:44] gold uh he was probably the most anti-
[35:48] Bitcoin Maxi guy I had on uh but even
[35:52] though the the episode was great
[35:55] performing and people liked it I think I
[35:58] think it's it's not bad uh if you bring
[36:01] on other guests um but right now like I
[36:05] like to speak with
[36:07] bitcoiners and that's why I have the
[36:09] bitcoiners on yeah and I meant it more
[36:12] in the sense that like it's education
[36:14] through debate I I didn't mean it so
[36:16] much as like uh giving them a space to
[36:19] advertise their own product but more as
[36:21] in like how much you learn from debating
[36:24] these Technologies and actually
[36:26] explaining why they're not Bitcoin and
[36:28] why they're not that like the VA that
[36:31] the value that they're trying to propose
[36:32] or the arguments they're trying to make
[36:34] are not there but like but then I
[36:37] realized that that would make more sense
[36:38] if you have two guests one who is in
[36:41] favor of it one who is against and they
[36:43] can debate the technology together that
[36:47] like a hosting yeah I would definitely I
[36:51] would definitely do that I don't know if
[36:53] if um someone is willing to do that
[36:56] because I'm clearly on the Bitcoin camp
[36:58] and I would have to be the moderator
[37:00] that's neutral I it would be really hard
[37:02] for me to be that neutral host but I
[37:06] think I would be not not as bad in this
[37:08] as as some might think uh but right now
[37:13] I'm just like really curious about
[37:15] bitcoiners uh and I I am booked till I
[37:19] think like middle of may like I'm always
[37:22] like at least two sometimes even four
[37:24] weeks in advance completely booked every
[37:26] day with with guests
[37:28] uh so I I have absolute no problem in in
[37:31] getting guests on the podcast uh and so
[37:34] I'm like before I ran out of Bitcoin
[37:37] maybe I think of like he is really
[37:40] interesting maybe let's get a debate or
[37:42] something like that but there's so many
[37:45] great people out there that I want to
[37:48] interview before I I get into altcoins
[37:51] or stuff like that uh and then there's
[37:54] already this thing where I'm like okay
[37:56] this episodes getting uh a few months
[38:00] old now half a year old maybe soon like
[38:02] a year old I started in in December
[38:05] December is still far away but at some
[38:07] point it's getting one year old uh what
[38:10] do I do do I release great episodes
[38:13] again because it was a great episode and
[38:15] I can release it again or do I invite
[38:17] him back uh and have a second round with
[38:20] him uh and then there are those
[38:22] questions where I'm like Curious like I
[38:25] think I will not run out of of cool
[38:28] bitcoiners to interview uh this is a
[38:30] thing that I actually feared when I
[38:32] started it but there are so many great
[38:35] people in Bitcoin and also there's
[38:37] always a new thing happening so my my
[38:40] opinion it would be to just invite them
[38:43] again because there's always something
[38:44] new happening in Bitcoin and they'll
[38:46] have a new perspective about this uh new
[38:49] bip or this new the wallet who's doing
[38:53] things wrong or is doing things really
[38:55] right you know there's always something
[38:57] new to talk about so I'm sure you will
[38:59] have plenty of opportunities to come but
[39:03] I actually but I actually had this this
[39:05] fear where I'm like who will come on my
[39:07] podcast like like now 100 episodes later
[39:10] it's it's it's it seems
[39:12] irrational but I had to like who who
[39:15] will who is willing to come on my
[39:17] podcast like who is willing to talk with
[39:19] me turns out people uh like to talk
[39:22] about themselves and people like to be
[39:24] interviewed uh I rarely get some one to
[39:28] say no to an invitation even bigger ones
[39:31] like I actually nobody uh that's only I
[39:36] think three or four people that said no
[39:39] uh but they are not because they're big
[39:41] they just said no because they never
[39:43] went on an interview and they said like
[39:45] ah they want to stay private and stuff
[39:47] like that and I even have P people on
[39:50] completely Anonymous like their the
[39:52] voices they they uh yeah
[39:57] yeah well no image and with the voice um
[40:01] muffled or like no I just blend in like
[40:06] a black screen uh like they're not shown
[40:08] at all uh and it's just their voice so
[40:11] like I'm the only one seen in the screen
[40:14] and I was just blend in their their
[40:16] profile photo usually uh and that's also
[40:20] like that's I'm like I'm open that like
[40:22] if someone doesn't want to share his his
[40:24] face it's it's it's fine for me like
[40:27] this there's no problem and even it's
[40:29] funny it has no impact on the average
[40:31] fuel duration I thought like people want
[40:33] to see faces but it that's not like the
[40:37] people still watch it usually normally
[40:39] no and then there's also some very
[40:41] important players in the big Bitcoin
[40:43] industry that will be willing to
[40:46] participate in the conversation but want
[40:48] to remain anonymous because I I've uh
[40:51] been like when we were doing the Tony
[40:53] Bas podcast that also happened that we
[40:55] would have guess he would have guessed
[40:57] that were Anonymous with the voice
[41:01] Distortion as
[41:03] well voice Distortion actually did not
[41:05] had I think I have can I do it wait now
[41:09] you hear me differently
[41:12] right could you hear me differently now
[41:15] a little bit just a little bit yes okay
[41:18] then not not really okay but now it's in
[41:21] back monom yeah it was just a little
[41:23] subtle like a little deeper but it
[41:24] wasn't like but who knows who knows it
[41:27] that is enough to like do the trick yeah
[41:31] I I I I played around with my new mixer
[41:34] because because of the new microphone I
[41:35] need a mix and I was like I played
[41:38] around a little bit with that uh but I
[41:41] was like yeah you could do it like that
[41:43] and just go in interview with with that
[41:45] but it's more for me it's more a gimmick
[41:48] and uh not not a voice Distortion my
[41:51] voice is pretty nor
[41:53] now so I have another question for you I
[41:56] mean I have another question about the
[41:58] 100 episodes but before I get to it I
[41:59] want to ask you um what's your fav
[42:02] favorite Bitcoin
[42:07] book I mean uh the one that I actually
[42:11] still give out to Orange P people is the
[42:13] Bitcoin standard uh it's it's it's
[42:17] really boring to say it because it's so
[42:21] such an obvious choice but it there's a
[42:23] reason why it's so obvious um it
[42:27] explains the the thing how I see it the
[42:32] best way and I was orange build a lot by
[42:35] C moose I was orange built also by
[42:38] Michael sailor a lot in in my early days
[42:42] for like right around four years ago um
[42:45] probably that's why like this book
[42:48] helped me the most to get Bitcoin when I
[42:52] uh first got into Bitcoin I was in the
[42:55] stock mindset so I was like
[42:57] asset has to have a cash flow other if
[43:00] it doesn't have a cash flow I cannot
[43:02] value
[43:03] it and I really needed Michael S and C
[43:07] Mo explaining me the value of money what
[43:11] is money uh and it did does not has to
[43:14] be a a cash flow and cine does this
[43:17] great because he can explain the history
[43:19] of money so great especially in his book
[43:22] uh and I'm I'm now uh trying to read
[43:26] also his his uh second and third book uh
[43:29] and I think he co- readd even a fourth
[43:32] book or something like that about food
[43:34] which I'm curious about but it there too
[43:36] many books to read honestly in the
[43:39] already there so many great things going
[43:41] on and I love it h and uh Michel saor
[43:44] was great because he is the longest
[43:48] serving publicly traded CEO public the
[43:51] CEO of a public Trad company uh so he
[43:54] knows how to speak to an investor and I
[43:57] was an investor in stocks so his
[44:00] articulating things his way of speaking
[44:03] really resonated with me uh so I would
[44:06] love for him to write a book I would
[44:08] have really really really liked it but
[44:11] he did not write a book he just uh
[44:13] decided to go on on on podcast which I
[44:15] respect the decision uh but cerine the
[44:18] way he explained it in the biton
[44:21] standard is still for me uh the favorite
[44:24] uh favorite book and I think it's really
[44:27] cool also that the forward of the
[44:29] Bitcoin standard is now with Michael
[44:31] sailor uh after the how was his name tal
[44:36] thalis the other one that was before the
[44:39] the forward of of of the Bitcoin
[44:42] standard and now it's Michael S and I
[44:44] love that they they two have like
[44:46] partnered up for for that book and it's
[44:49] it's still my number one book for orange
[44:52] peing people and giving it to people I I
[44:55] meet an ex colleague in like three weeks
[45:00] uh and when I went uh from from my work
[45:03] I gifted her this book so I'm really
[45:06] curious if she uh has read it and I will
[45:10] interview her about it not interview on
[45:12] on on on the podcast but I will speak
[45:14] with you about it so this was the book
[45:17] that was also the most successful in
[45:19] Orange Building people because when I go
[45:22] ahead and and try to speak with people
[45:23] about Bitcoin in in real life and orange
[45:26] buing them I'm really defensive like if
[45:29] they are interested in it they can come
[45:31] to me and I will Point them to to
[45:33] resources and I'm if they then invested
[45:36] time in being in a book being in that
[45:39] and that and that then I'm I'm willing
[45:41] to debate them a little bit more and
[45:43] willing to speak with them more I
[45:46] completely uh stopped speaking with
[45:49] people that did not spend time learning
[45:51] about Bitcoin it's I found it maybe
[45:55] it's maybe it's controvers but I found
[45:58] it's a waste of time to speak with
[46:00] people that are opinionated about
[46:03] Bitcoin but have no clue about yeah like
[46:07] if if they're neutral or don't know then
[46:09] there's still like a way of like having
[46:11] a dialogue but if someone is negative
[46:13] but also doesn't want to study it it's
[46:15] difficult to then find Common Ground
[46:17] definitely
[46:19] actually sorry go ahead and even people
[46:23] that uh are neutral about it or like
[46:26] even positive about it I put them on
[46:30] like you should study this you should
[46:31] study this you should study this and
[46:34] then after that uh I will will talk with
[46:37] them because I think you have to bitcoin
[46:40] is not something you you can spark an
[46:43] interest in someone in like a one two
[46:45] hour conversation uh but you have to sit
[46:48] down and really understand it it's
[46:49] something that's for most people most
[46:52] people think inflation is good most
[46:54] people think uh um that this this this
[46:58] whole concept of Bitcoin and
[46:59] deflationary money uh is is is not as
[47:03] great inflation is good we need
[47:05] inflation a little bit of it maybe we
[47:07] have now too much inflation but a little
[47:09] bit inflation is good uh most people
[47:11] still think that because it's teached in
[47:13] the schools uh then blockchain nobody
[47:16] knows what actually blockchain is and
[47:18] then uh I also try never to introduce
[47:22] too many words they don't understand
[47:24] like if you talk with someone uh and you
[47:27] mention one two words they don't
[47:29] understand they're gone so that's why
[47:32] I'm like not even mentioning blockchain
[47:35] or any like blockchain is like a really
[47:38] uh like when you say blockchain to a
[47:40] bitcoiner they think that you are in
[47:42] crypto world uh and then you mention bit
[47:45] blockchain to a newb he does not know
[47:48] what you're speaking about so like
[47:49] blockchain you can basically completely
[47:51] delete from your from
[47:53] your uh way of of speaking uh and yeah
[47:57] it's like I'm trying to to to make it
[48:01] really easy like go out in the world go
[48:04] in some places where a lot of people
[48:07] pass by and ask them what the Haring is
[48:11] like if you interview 100 people maybe
[48:13] one guy knows it because he got in he
[48:17] got he saw it in the news and he read
[48:20] something about it like not a lot of
[48:21] people know what what what the things
[48:23] that we are taking for granted are uh so
[48:27] we have to be the Educators we have to
[48:30] make education really really good and
[48:33] accessible for everybody and this means
[48:35] not talking too much technical there
[48:38] there if if you have a technical podcast
[48:40] this is fine uh but this is a podcast
[48:43] probably for bitcoiners that all India
[48:45] and they want to dive deeper for
[48:47] programmers and stuff like that but if
[48:49] you uh wanting to have the newer guys
[48:52] the newer people uh in the in the
[48:55] Bitcoin sphere you cannot talk uh in
[48:58] those technical terms you should also
[49:00] like delete some some trigger words from
[49:03] your language and I always try to do
[49:04] that in my podcast and it gets really
[49:06] hard um like if if there's something in
[49:09] the podcast that is uh hard to
[49:12] understand or like a word that is not
[49:14] commonly used I always ask the guest
[49:17] okay can you expand like please
[49:19] summarize quickly what what you're
[49:20] talking about I had someone on uh he he
[49:24] was talking about why lightning the
[49:27] lightning network will revolutionize the
[49:29] workforce and and he had some articles
[49:31] in the the Bitcoin magazine even about
[49:34] that and the first thing I did in the
[49:36] podcast I asked him okay can you please
[49:38] in simple terms uh explain what is the
[49:41] lightning Network how does it work uh
[49:44] and uh and yeah he he he had a great he
[49:48] had a great explanation for that but I
[49:50] think this is always important to lay
[49:52] the groundwork because there's some guy
[49:55] that is completely new to bitcoin that
[49:57] watches now the second video of of of of
[50:00] Bitcoin and then there's someone talking
[50:02] about the lightning Network and he's
[50:04] confused he's like what is it like is
[50:06] this something else than Bitcoin does it
[50:08] belong to bitcoin is it integrative like
[50:11] people don't know that and so you have
[50:13] to be really back to the basics uh and
[50:16] this is the the the the most important
[50:20] stuff you have to stick to the basics
[50:22] you have to speak in a simple language
[50:25] people can understand uh otherwise they
[50:28] will just turn off like they they're
[50:29] sitting in front of their laptop uh and
[50:32] there are like 50 other things they can
[50:34] do right now and there is Netflix
[50:36] popping up they can relax now they can
[50:38] go to bed they can play a video game but
[50:41] they're choosing to watch this video
[50:43] about Bitcoin they're giving us their
[50:45] time and getting educated on stuff so we
[50:49] should not like uh being in have make
[50:53] inside jokes or like being uh some
[50:56] something excluded like if if you make
[50:58] an inside joke and someone new comes in
[51:01] he does not get it and if you're not
[51:03] inside you're outside and then he clicks
[51:05] away and he's he's gone uh so that's
[51:08] really uh important for I think for for
[51:12] bitcoiners for educators for podcast
[51:16] hosts um if you're not specific
[51:19] Technical and specific for pro
[51:21] bitcoiners that are already in there and
[51:23] want to dive deep in some technical
[51:24] terms then I understand it but if you
[51:26] are
[51:27] someone that has like Jeff poofs and the
[51:29] Michael Sailors on and then has people
[51:32] on that more aim to the new people keep
[51:35] it really really simple like there's no
[51:39] need to scare someone away with weird uh
[51:42] financial terms this is what uh the the
[51:45] financial planners in the bank always do
[51:47] like they they tell you so many
[51:49] financial terms that you're like and
[51:52] then you're like okay here my money and
[51:53] deal with it but we are not that like we
[51:56] want to uh have them take care of their
[52:00] own Financial uh future and that's why
[52:03] we have to educate them and this is
[52:05] something that I'm really passionate
[52:06] about that uh education uh of of of new
[52:11] people or like the newer folks in
[52:13] Bitcoin and yeah I think it's really
[52:16] important to speak in a simple
[52:18] language yeah actually that like goes
[52:20] into one of my questions that I wanted
[52:22] to ask you earlier but I we got carried
[52:25] away like why Bitcoin what was your
[52:28] Bitcoin Journey how did you like this
[52:31] you kind of told me like what your
[52:32] journey was but how did you discover it
[52:35] and how did you like how did it capture
[52:39] you and why important yeah that's a
[52:43] really cool story um I was before I
[52:46] talked about like let let's start from
[52:49] the beginning um when I was 18 years old
[52:52] or maybe let's start even earlier I was
[52:53] always a extremely saving person like
[52:56] even when my mom gave me like three
[52:58] Euros uh to to school so I can get some
[53:02] bread in the school I always took away
[53:05] at least one Euro so I was like even
[53:07] when I was really small and really
[53:09] little I got the point where I'm like if
[53:11] I Sav that money I can buy my own stuff
[53:15] from that like I'm not depending on my
[53:17] mom then so like I I got the in in
[53:21] initially this thing like if I save
[53:24] Financial energy despise me Freedom that
[53:27] what that I can do whatever I want with
[53:29] that money obviously you don't get rich
[53:31] if you save one a day from Mom's pocket
[53:34] money when you're like 10 years old uh
[53:37] but uh this was really like early on and
[53:40] there's even this this one thing in in
[53:44] that I this is funny I never shared the
[53:47] story but I think it it stuck in my head
[53:49] and I was like in school I don't know
[53:51] how old I was like really little maybe
[53:54] 11 or 12 years old or something like
[53:55] that and I was extremely saving like and
[53:58] when the other people and it's I'm not
[54:00] like from a a poor family like I was
[54:02] from a middle class normal family uh my
[54:06] dad struggled a lot because he built a
[54:09] company uh but then when he built a
[54:11] company he did really good because he
[54:13] sold the company and stuff like that uh
[54:15] so we yeah struggled financially till I
[54:18] was like five years old but then it was
[54:19] like middle glass and it was really good
[54:22] um but so I I I didn't had to save ccie
[54:25] like I I did not had to like save every
[54:28] scent and watch everything because
[54:30] everything has been given to me um but
[54:33] the funny thing is that I was the saving
[54:35] personality and it's probably because of
[54:37] my dad because he also like is like that
[54:40] and when my it was like in one lunchtime
[54:44] in school it was like 11: um a.m. and it
[54:47] was lunchtime I was in the the spa in a
[54:49] local supermarket uh and my mom was by
[54:53] accident also there and she saw that I
[54:56] only like got a really small bread
[54:59] because I know when I come home I have
[55:01] the whole fridge for myself and I don't
[55:02] have to buy anything so why eat now a
[55:05] lot when I can eat later for free uh and
[55:08] I had this small bread and my mom was
[55:11] like here five years buy something
[55:15] more she she she she could not see it
[55:19] and uh this is uh some some stories that
[55:22] like stuck with me and having this
[55:25] savings mind which is then into also
[55:27] important for the latest story when you
[55:30] when you then get to 18 years old you
[55:32] all of the sudden I even next to school
[55:35] I worked because I got it that I have to
[55:38] work and and and start earning my money
[55:42] uh so I earned my money and I had an an
[55:44] IT job like a software developer because
[55:47] I was in a software developing school so
[55:49] I had like some small projects even with
[55:51] 18 years old uh going on and uh I saved
[55:55] just money and 18 years old then you can
[55:58] invest because before 18 years old
[56:00] you're not allowed to invest without
[56:02] your mom and dad at least in austri I
[56:04] don't know how it's is around the world
[56:06] which is funny for me you can vote with
[56:09] 16 years old you can drive a car with 17
[56:11] years old but investing your in your
[56:13] future you're not allowed till till 18
[56:16] years old but it's okay uh so I open my
[56:19] my account I got into uh ETFs FS stuff
[56:25] like that nothing special I think I made
[56:28] like a few Euros in a year and yeah lost
[56:32] it all because I had to pay fees and
[56:34] stuff like that I saw first year of
[56:36] investing it was like leveling out uh
[56:39] and uh I had this
[56:42] moment uh where where I invested then uh
[56:45] in individual stocks also and the funny
[56:49] thing is like I had no clue about stock
[56:51] picking I had no clue about what it is
[56:53] but I knew I want to do more with my
[56:55] money like the savings account I had I
[56:57] had the ETFs but it was not it not
[56:59] enough like it was like I put it there
[57:01] because then my money was not in the
[57:03] bank account so I I don't know why I
[57:06] knew initially that it's not doing good
[57:09] if it's just sitting in a bank account
[57:11] I'm really grateful that I just had this
[57:14] feeling always that if it's just in a
[57:16] bank account it's not doing anything I
[57:18] did not understand money like but I just
[57:21] in like from my heart I knew if it's
[57:24] just sitting there not doing anything
[57:26] uh which is fascinating for me that I
[57:28] understood that without any knowledge
[57:30] about it like there was no guy in my
[57:32] family explained it to me like was just
[57:34] something that came to my mind uh and
[57:38] then uh yeah savings account ETFs and
[57:40] stuff like that uh and then I was like
[57:43] yeah let's pick individual stocks I had
[57:45] no clue about it but let's let's get
[57:47] into it and the moment where I was
[57:49] deciding let's go into individual stocks
[57:52] I was sitting at McDonald's uh as yeah
[57:55] as a 19-year-old uh boy and I was like
[57:58] yeah let's let's buy McDonald's stocks
[57:59] so I bought McDonald's stocks and funny
[58:02] enough from that McDonald's stock I got
[58:05] a lot of motivation because all of the
[58:07] sudden they were like I don't know 500
[58:09] 600 or something like that in the stock
[58:12] and because of that I learned a lot
[58:14] about Stock Investing PE ratios stuff
[58:17] like that management even got some
[58:19] courses online do really deep the good
[58:23] thing I was bored at school so I had my
[58:26] headphones on and learned while learned
[58:28] about investing while I was sitting on
[58:31] School uh I may I make this story maybe
[58:34] a little too long hopefully it's not bad
[58:36] for you and it's uh you
[58:41] know around bitcoiners or I mean when I
[58:44] started uh into Bitcoin I learned that
[58:47] in children one of the signs that
[58:49] they're going to be successful in life
[58:51] is if they understand delayed reward so
[58:55] like if you do an exercise is like I can
[58:56] give you one cookie now or two cookies
[58:59] when you get back from school which do
[59:00] you pick and the children who pick two
[59:02] cookies when you get back from school
[59:04] tend to have a a a higher chance to
[59:08] succeed in life so so those are very
[59:11] like the trades that you're talking
[59:12] about go very are very aligned with the
[59:14] Bitcoin culture yeah
[59:17] 100% yeah and moving on with the story I
[59:21] like uh I then started to learn a lot
[59:24] about individual stock picking and I was
[59:28] quite successful with it uh I made
[59:31] my H actually quite huge gains with it I
[59:35] lost also a lot of money was a really
[59:39] interesting ride for like three years or
[59:40] something like that and because I was
[59:43] extremely successful and I was outspoken
[59:45] about it I even had a YouTube channel
[59:46] with Stock Investing I talked about uh
[59:49] Tesla stock because this was my most
[59:51] successful stock that I had also I had
[59:54] Apple Facebook I had all the tech stock
[59:56] because I was a software developer uh
[59:58] and because I was so outspoken about uh
[60:01] my investing strategies and how much I
[60:04] even shared exactly how much money I
[60:06] made I now deleted all those videos
[60:10] because it was uh then you could figure
[60:12] out how much Bitcoin I have now and I'm
[60:14] trying to hi this a little bit more uh
[60:18] but yeah I guess you can kind of find it
[60:20] out online if you if you really dig deep
[60:22] I don't know if it's possible still uh
[60:24] but maybe it's somehow possible
[60:27] uh and even small amount of Bitcoin will
[60:30] be coveted
[60:32] so um once you're in the public eye what
[60:35] really matters is that you you follow
[60:37] your own advice in the sense that we we
[60:40] follow our own advice in terms of
[60:42] security safety
[60:45] privacy and just be meticulous with your
[60:47] cold storage and all that stuff because
[60:49] even yeah I don't know if you knew about
[60:51] that hack where one of the Bitcoin
[60:52] developers he's even like a Bitcoin core
[60:55] developer and he got robbed because
[60:57] someone I mean recently they sent this
[61:01] disclosure that the FBI had collected
[61:05] the names of all the people who had
[61:07] bought tickets to some developer
[61:09] conference so it's s It's seems like
[61:12] someone from there was the person who
[61:14] robbed him so you just have to be very
[61:16] careful yeah 100% I think in self-
[61:19] custody um there are those points where
[61:23] you have to hit like if you have over a
[61:25] thousand uh Euros or dollars in Bitcoin
[61:28] you have to have self custody there's no
[61:30] way around that under 1,000 uh there's
[61:34] might be like okay let's let's
[61:36] accumulate them on Exchange and then
[61:38] move them over to self custody once it
[61:40] hits that but even then you can have
[61:43] like an an Mobile wallet or something
[61:45] like that but there can be this argument
[61:47] made that
[61:49] uh Bitcoin on Exchange might be even
[61:52] safer than some some Mobile wallet when
[61:54] it's like broken and then you can not
[61:56] not find it anymore but uh but even
[61:59] above thousand EUR there's no discussion
[62:01] about self- custody you have to have
[62:02] self- custody uh and I'm thrilling my
[62:05] friends about it because I have a lot of
[62:07] friends that are in Bitcoin and they
[62:09] have a lot more money than a thousand
[62:11] EUR in in Bitcoin and they keep it on
[62:13] Exchange and they even had it on in
[62:16] Celsius and they lost money but now they
[62:19] got it back and then it's not that bad
[62:22] because they actually got like I don't
[62:23] know 70 80% or something like that from
[62:26] is back so now they're like playing it
[62:28] down again and I'm like
[62:30] yeah you will lose it again thank you
[62:33] you already made it halfway through the
[62:35] video and I'm really really grateful to
[62:37] have you here two things make this
[62:39] channel possible you as a watcher and
[62:41] listening who keep supporting this
[62:43] Channel and another one is all the
[62:46] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[62:48] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[62:50] very start and where I personally buy my
[62:52] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[62:54] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[62:57] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[63:00] simplest and securest way to secure your
[63:03] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[63:05] only 2% of bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin
[63:08] in a hardware wallet how crazy is that
[63:10] don't be in that 98% bracket be in the
[63:14] 2% bracket and if you have self- custody
[63:17] and you know your friend does not have
[63:18] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[63:20] he needs a bir of present and a small
[63:22] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[63:24] 5% off your order plus you support my
[63:28] channel and now let's get back to the
[63:30] video I really liked a lot of the things
[63:32] you were saying because for the Spanish
[63:34] podcast like I'm Colombian originally
[63:37] and so I want to do a version of the
[63:40] podcast in Spanish but I had been like
[63:42] struggling to like how to get started
[63:46] and I think that a lot of what you said
[63:49] helped me in the sense that it might be
[63:51] easier to start the Colombian podcast
[63:54] with the stuff that to me is kind of
[63:57] trivial but I think it's it's not
[63:59] actually trivial it's just trivial to me
[64:01] because I've heard it so many times I've
[64:03] had it so internalized that I don't like
[64:05] give it the worth and the value that it
[64:07] has which is to start with the
[64:08] philosophy and the culture and more like
[64:11] what is money and why do we like but in
[64:13] this but relating it back to events in
[64:15] South America or Latin events because
[64:18] it's very difficult for Latin people
[64:20] they don't relate to like um um like uh
[64:25] um you know how the money goes to the
[64:29] bankers and we uh how do you call it
[64:31] when
[64:32] you uh bailout the bailouts like the
[64:36] like a lot of Latin people don't have a
[64:38] strong relationship to this idea of
[64:40] bailing out the banks or what because
[64:42] that's not not happening so much in some
[64:44] of the Latin countries as it happens in
[64:46] the developed countries so we have to
[64:49] like relate it back to economical
[64:50] factors that are happening locally in
[64:52] those communities but without using big
[64:54] words oh my dog that reminds me I think
[64:58] the book I think um when when safan book
[65:03] was coming
[65:04] out um that was right when I was getting
[65:07] into Bitcoin and I think that I got that
[65:09] book for free because I took a photo
[65:12] with my dog and the mastering Bitcoin
[65:14] book and it was like a little
[65:15] competition so safe Dian sent me uh what
[65:19] is uh no
[65:22] um uh the the Bitcoin standard he sent
[65:26] me the Bitcoin standard because I had
[65:27] won this little photo competition when I
[65:29] first got into Bitcoin so I read this
[65:32] book a long time ago and a lot of the
[65:35] things that you talk about the book were
[65:37] the things that resonated with me a lot
[65:38] like he he has a very good ability to
[65:41] explaining what is money very clearly
[65:43] and like why why that whole structure is
[65:47] falling apart why and and he makes it
[65:49] less like we're so attached to to the
[65:53] coins that we use today because it's
[65:55] become normal so just the idea that like
[65:57] you would be switching from shells to
[66:00] gold is like no why we have shells like
[66:03] why would we use gold you're crazy so
[66:06] like uh it allows you to understand like
[66:08] the evolution and kind of become less
[66:09] attached to to and and being more
[66:12] capable of letting go of this idea that
[66:14] we need Fiat and become more comfortable
[66:17] with the idea that this can evolve and
[66:19] become that like our money can become a
[66:20] new thing it doesn't have to be the same
[66:22] thing we've been using because this
[66:24] isn't what we have used forever
[66:26] so I I do think that that's a great
[66:28] choice even though it's an obvious one
[66:31] yeah and it's it's so important that we
[66:33] hmer home this uh Basics uh and I just
[66:37] discovered that I was I I did I did want
[66:41] off in my story I was I did not even
[66:43] come to my Bitcoin part of the story how
[66:46] I discovered Bitcoin I just oh yeah then
[66:48] what happened tell
[66:50] us I'm sorry I'm I'm all over the place
[66:53] usually when I speak that's why when
[66:55] when I have like U my my interviews
[66:58] lined up uh and I have the guest on I I
[67:01] have to have like a document on where
[67:03] I'm like okay I wanted to talk about
[67:05] this and I have this question still on
[67:07] stuff like that then I'm organized then
[67:09] I can dig deep but if I'm like
[67:11] interviewed I'm have not no notes or
[67:13] something like that I'm just like going
[67:16] I'm going which is more chaotic but I
[67:20] was successful investing and people kept
[67:23] asking me about Bitcoin and I was for
[67:24] three years saying it's it's a scam and
[67:26] that's why I'm saying we have to get
[67:28] those Basics right I was saying from
[67:31] 2017 to 20 20120 that Bitcoin is a scam
[67:36] uh and then a friend a colleague of mine
[67:38] actually asked me oh what do you think
[67:40] of Bitcoin and he was not even in
[67:41] Bitcoin like he was just asking me about
[67:44] it uh but he was asking so great that I
[67:48] discovered that I don't have good enough
[67:50] arguments and I went on this journey on
[67:54] Friday Saturday Sunday like weekend
[67:55] Journey I'm like I don't have a lot of
[67:58] plans and I had this um I I didn't have
[68:02] as much to do as I have now so I had the
[68:04] time to like really block out just three
[68:06] days and dive really deep into one topic
[68:10] uh like Friday coming home uh from I
[68:14] think it was work back then uh yeah for
[68:18] civil service I had then it was work on
[68:20] Friday midday I came home got to my
[68:23] computer and was diving deep into
[68:25] Bitcoin till Sunday to prove to my
[68:29] friend that was not even in Bitcoin why
[68:32] Bitcoin that that a
[68:35] scam yes I I want to prove I want to
[68:38] find the arguments why Bitcoin is a
[68:40] scam and I'm always really open to
[68:44] everything like I'm I'm I'm not someone
[68:46] that wants to find his arguments I want
[68:49] really want to dive deep and I
[68:50] discovered the Bitcoin Community back
[68:51] then uh in this in this weekend I
[68:55] discovered interviews podcast and I was
[68:56] like oh this could be something
[68:58] that that this could this could be not a
[69:01] scam uh so on Monday I opened my
[69:04] coinbase account on Tuesday I bought uh
[69:07] my ledger uh this was yeah I I obviously
[69:11] don't have my coinbase account anymore I
[69:13] obviously don't have a ledger anymore
[69:16] um I I still have I I had this and then
[69:21] I like this is also something I don't
[69:23] know why but I did not even get Bitcoin
[69:27] but I got self custody on the second day
[69:30] and I still kind of thought that Bitcoin
[69:32] is a scam but I already got self custody
[69:34] like I never had custody Bitcoin like
[69:37] from the first Euro that I invested in
[69:39] Bitcoin I always had self custody uh I
[69:43] don't know why actually I just like I
[69:44] watched the video and he's like y get
[69:46] self custody uh and I was like okay
[69:48] let's get self custody then I didn't
[69:51] understand what it is I I think I I
[69:53] thought it's the only way to hold
[69:55] Bitcoin I thought you cannot even hold
[69:57] it somewhere else uh because the
[70:00] exchange that I used to buy my stocks
[70:03] did not offer Bitcoin back then so I was
[70:07] like oh I have to get to uh and like how
[70:10] to buy Bitcoin and then there was like
[70:12] some video I don't even remember who
[70:13] made it but he's like oh get a coinbase
[70:16] account then put it on your Ledger and
[70:17] then I was like okay let's get a
[70:19] coinbase account buy a ledger put it on
[70:21] there so like there was never the
[70:22] question if I leave it on coinbase
[70:25] and yeah this was basically my Bitcoin
[70:28] story it was 2020 and from there onwards
[70:31] I just learned every week a little bit
[70:33] more and funny enough from 2020 to one
[70:37] year later I went from having all those
[70:40] stocks all those properties uh and
[70:42] getting completely only in Bitcoin one
[70:45] year later like 2021 was the point where
[70:48] I was only in Bitcoin because I got
[70:50] educated on on it and I was like at some
[70:54] point I was 5050 50% Tesla 50% Bitcoin
[70:58] then I was like one day it does not make
[71:01] sense that I hold Tesla Tesla can be
[71:03] crashing tomorrow because IL musk makes
[71:06] some something stupid I still
[71:08] tweet yeah some tweet or something I
[71:11] think the company is great uh but
[71:15] holding so much money in just one
[71:17] company is a big risk because with every
[71:20] company they can all the time something
[71:22] happening so I was just like yeah I
[71:25] don't want to have this centralized risk
[71:27] uh and I don't know when some somewhere
[71:30] around 2021 I decided to ditch all my
[71:33] Tesla stocks and and got slowly slowly
[71:35] more and more in Bitcoin and I had 5%
[71:39] 10% 20% in Bitcoin and then yeah one
[71:42] year later around that time after I got
[71:44] my my first Bitcoin uh then I got all in
[71:47] in Bitcoin I only have Bitcoin now I
[71:50] like I I own my microphone laptop camera
[71:53] computer and and my Bitcoin that's it
[71:56] nothing else like I I live rented I live
[72:00] I don't own anything else not even a car
[72:02] or something like that I I I I I try to
[72:05] own nothing except Bitcoin and things
[72:09] where it does not make sense to rent it
[72:10] I I saw like some phone renting and
[72:14] laptop renting but this does not make
[72:16] sense for me financially so I the things
[72:20] that are small like under th000 like
[72:23] microphone phone
[72:25] kebo and stuff like that I buy but other
[72:28] than that and cloves of course and stuff
[72:31] but other than that I just have
[72:33] Bitcoin yeah I actually watched an
[72:35] episode of somebody who has been in
[72:37] Bitcoin for a long time now and he was
[72:39] talking about how he didn't own real
[72:41] estate anymore or anything because that
[72:44] way he was uh free move who could move
[72:47] and move around the only part that I
[72:49] found Difficult about that concept or
[72:51] that approach is my trust for the food
[72:54] sources the thing is that like in Europe
[72:56] you don't you're not at such risk but
[72:58] living in the United States like I don't
[73:00] trust the steak I can buy at the store I
[73:02] don't trust the eggs I don't drust the
[73:03] milk it's you you have to be very
[73:05] careful how you Source your food if you
[73:07] don't own
[73:09] anything I have chickens at home oh yeah
[73:12] I mean this is like I also have a small
[73:15] dog but but I don't
[73:17] I when I S don't have assets I I don't
[73:20] consider my my dog
[73:23] asset you have to kind of have land to
[73:26] be able to have chickens and oh yes yes
[73:29] like
[73:30] that definitely and I like the approach
[73:34] that Jack MERS said like I think Jack
[73:36] MERS uh and I want to get to this level
[73:39] I me even a tweet about it uh he said
[73:41] like I own my company my house and uh my
[73:47] Bitcoin and I think this is a good
[73:49] approach like if you have a company
[73:51] obviously it's good to own it uh and
[73:54] then uh the next thing is a
[73:56] house I would if if you have uh not
[74:01] enough money uh so like if if you're in
[74:04] a situation where when you buy a house
[74:06] it would be all your financial energy
[74:09] that you need to buy this house I would
[74:11] definitely not recommend buying a house
[74:13] because then all your financial energy
[74:14] is tied into that then you have to pay
[74:16] back a credit maybe over 40 20 years
[74:19] this is like really um hard to overcome
[74:21] and it binds you into one place but if
[74:24] you really want to like it's emotional
[74:26] an emotional decision you can still do
[74:28] it uh I I personally don't choose to do
[74:32] that because I don't I want to be a
[74:33] little bit more free if you're in a
[74:35] situation where like when you buy a
[74:37] house it would only be like a few
[74:39] percent of your net worth then like go
[74:42] ahead and don't have a problem with that
[74:44] uh but I would not pay to put all my
[74:48] financial energy in a house and then
[74:50] don't have any Bitcoin or stuff like
[74:52] that because uh I think real estate
[74:55] could uh become let let's let's frame it
[74:58] more positively real estate will become
[75:00] way more affordable in the future I
[75:02] think well and the thing is that the
[75:04] trick is that you buy the house then
[75:07] you're in debt then you have to have a
[75:09] job so you become a slave to the Fiat
[75:11] system because you need that income in
[75:14] order to pay for the house so the the
[75:17] objective of this Bitcoin Community is
[75:19] to try to help you strive away from
[75:21] those like money money uh time stealing
[75:25] IES yeah and this is something that I'm
[75:28] actually uh I mentioned my my I mean I
[75:32] keep mentioning my book but it's not
[75:34] even like not even
[75:36] written let let's see how it it was but
[75:39] this is kind of also the idea uh where I
[75:41] want to go because uh I learned a lot by
[75:45] interviewing people and by uh like just
[75:48] being on my own and being way more free
[75:52] because Bitcoin in the end of the day is
[75:53] just money but money can teach you
[75:56] something uh and uh I'm now in the
[75:58] position where I'm totally uh free of
[76:02] time and location like I can choose
[76:06] whenever I want to uh work and I can
[76:08] choose wherever I want to work because
[76:10] it's all like online uh the thing that I
[76:14] did not uh succeed at if completely uh
[76:16] is is Financial Freedom uh for me
[76:19] Financial Freedom is when you have so
[76:21] much Financial energy that you can stop
[76:24] doing any work tomorrow and you will be
[76:27] fine for the rest of your life this is
[76:29] when you uh have complete Financial
[76:32] Freedom in in my in my definition other
[76:35] people have other definitions of of that
[76:37] uh so I try to value my T my financial
[76:41] energy actually in time I like when when
[76:44] someone ask me oh do you value your net
[76:47] worth in in in in Bitcoin or in Euros
[76:50] I'm like I value my net worth in time
[76:53] like when I
[76:55] stop doing everything
[76:57] tomorrow how many years can I possibly
[77:01] live of my Bitcoin stack that that's
[77:04] that's how I like I value my net worth
[77:06] in in in kind of a time obviously I'm
[77:08] not paying with like oh I I bought
[77:12] bought McDonald's for five minutes of my
[77:14] life now or something like that well
[77:16] it's just that's why some people say
[77:18] that there is never enough money because
[77:21] uh
[77:22] um uh the definition of what it means to
[77:26] be like so so I can get by for the rest
[77:28] of my life it changes from person to
[77:30] person like one person is going to want
[77:32] to have a yacht to travel around the
[77:36] ocean so they need a lot to get by for
[77:39] the rest of their life but if you I mean
[77:42] when if we're talking just the basics
[77:43] you know have a decent home have a uh
[77:47] like good access to good quality food th
[77:51] those things are not so expensive and if
[77:53] you live humble and you appreciate those
[77:56] little things in life then then that
[77:59] number goes down quite drastically and
[78:01] it becomes more feasible and
[78:03] accomplishable and I think uh when you
[78:05] get to this point where you're
[78:08] completely free like you lowered your
[78:10] life standard and this sounds always bad
[78:13] lowering your life standard but I think
[78:14] it's something good lowering your life
[78:16] standard to something that you like a
[78:19] minimalistic life where you can live off
[78:21] comfortable for a long period of time
[78:23] then you have all those three time and
[78:26] if you are a decent human being which I
[78:29] think 99% of the people are uh then you
[78:33] will do something with that time maybe
[78:34] not on the first week but at one month
[78:37] you will get bored I'm 100% sure like
[78:41] there are so many stories about young
[78:43] millionaires that try to retire at 23 uh
[78:47] then they retired till 24 and then they
[78:50] started companies at 25 again because
[78:52] yeah doing nothing is boring
[78:55] yeah is difficult you you have to like
[78:59] like okay you achieve that and then what
[79:01] you just spend it on a beach or you
[79:03] gonna travel or you go to bitcoin
[79:05] conferences like what do you do with
[79:07] that time you know and then there's this
[79:09] interesting point when you're completely
[79:11] free uh you don't have to spend any time
[79:14] where you don't want to spend it you can
[79:16] spend on the whole topics that you
[79:18] really are passionate about and then all
[79:20] of the sudden you're thinking of ways
[79:22] how you can contribute to that community
[79:25] then you're free of like I don't have to
[79:26] have money from that you can just
[79:28] contribute freely to it and I think then
[79:31] there's the point because you are
[79:33] contributing and because you are doing
[79:35] so many great things uh in this
[79:38] community that you're actually getting
[79:40] the money that you actually can buy
[79:41] maybe a yard someday or something like
[79:43] that because you're free you're you're
[79:45] thinking in another way and this is what
[79:48] I basically discovered I was really
[79:50] worried about finances I was like
[79:52] because I I'm always like I want to have
[79:55] more income than like expenses every
[79:57] month uh and I was like if I drop my
[80:01] normal job can I hold myself over water
[80:04] with having more income than expenses uh
[80:08] answer short is yes I can and I'm even
[80:11] like close to the level than I was
[80:13] before even though I just started out
[80:15] with with that uh but the amazing thing
[80:18] is that I don't worry about money like I
[80:20] was so worried before I took the step to
[80:22] become uh self-employed about money and
[80:26] it was completely senseless I I'm not
[80:28] worried about money at all in my I just
[80:31] stand up at like five six in the morning
[80:33] and I work the whole day to right now
[80:35] it's like 10 10:30 at my time so I'm
[80:38] like up like I don't even want to
[80:40] calculate how many hours I'm already
[80:41] working but it doesn't feel like it
[80:44] doesn't feel like work it doesn't feel
[80:46] like a burden to me uh and it's it's
[80:49] it's something so amazing if you can
[80:51] just stand up and and do what you like
[80:53] do what love I'm I'm feeling so grateful
[80:56] that I can H talk about the thing that
[80:58] I'm most passionate about in my life
[81:00] right now every day and this every day
[81:03] with a different human being uh that is
[81:06] uh amazing and does great things in his
[81:09] life and and I can learn from them and
[81:11] this is back to your original first
[81:13] question what who who did I learn the
[81:15] most from it I learned from every guest
[81:18] that comes on something new and this is
[81:21] fascinating you see because you if
[81:23] you're actually uh researching about the
[81:25] guest and you're actually listening to
[81:28] the guest because if you're host you
[81:30] kind of have to listen to the guest and
[81:32] you have to think of new questions and
[81:34] stuff like that and then post production
[81:36] you have to edit it you you listen to it
[81:38] twice like you listen to it three times
[81:41] before you published and maybe a fourth
[81:43] time uh you really learn a lot like I uh
[81:47] still um I'm having every day audio
[81:49] books and I'm I'm trying to learn more
[81:52] but even if I did not learn any anything
[81:55] just my guests are great source because
[81:57] we talking about social media we're
[81:59] talking about branding we're talking
[82:00] about businesses we're talking about
[82:02] Bitcoin we're talking about life we're
[82:04] talking about food we're talking about
[82:05] so many different things even just for
[82:07] my guests I think I would benefit so
[82:10] much from all those conversations and
[82:13] then I'm also getting uh invited to
[82:15] other podcasts this week I have uh this
[82:18] one and another one next week I have
[82:20] another invitation to podcast uh so this
[82:24] it's it's it's just great to being able
[82:26] to live off something that you really
[82:30] love and I can just encourage everybody
[82:34] to do exactly that I'm not as aggressive
[82:37] as Gary Kone says it if you are just
[82:40] working for money you're
[82:43] but but but I I truly think that if you
[82:47] are not happy with the things you're
[82:49] doing you you should at least try to to
[82:52] find something you love and find a way
[82:54] how you and uh um uh also get
[82:57] financially rewarded from that I think
[83:00] we have very similar Journeys like not
[83:02] not in everything but we have had
[83:04] moments where we've had very similar
[83:06] Journeys because right now I've like
[83:08] chosen to start this podcast and um the
[83:13] way it works for me is that if I'm
[83:15] having fun doing it like this can this
[83:18] can last for a very long time because I
[83:20] I enjoy the actual doing which is which
[83:24] is kind of like what you were saying
[83:26] like when I'm here and I'm shooting and
[83:28] I'm putting together the gadgets and I'm
[83:30] putting together the technical episodes
[83:32] like I knew a lot about Bitcoin before
[83:34] starting the podcast but I but I
[83:36] understood it like in a generic way but
[83:38] the podcast forces me to go from the
[83:41] generic to the specific and because I
[83:43] need to communicate these ideas and be
[83:46] very secure of like the technical
[83:47] Concepts and communicating so it's like
[83:50] forced me to go from like generic
[83:53] understandings to to completely specific
[83:55] like down to the code uh understandings
[83:58] and it's been really really fun I really
[84:00] connect with you on on the fact that you
[84:03] have to enjoy what you're doing and when
[84:04] you do enjoy it and the irony is that
[84:07] when you do enjoy it and you find
[84:09] something that you're passionate about
[84:10] you're very likely to make a lot of
[84:11] money from it yeah do do you have uh two
[84:15] different podcasts where you have like
[84:16] technical things and where you just like
[84:18] have this conversation like this it's
[84:20] more like a series uh so we have a
[84:22] technical series we have a gadget Series
[84:24] so the technical I'm just like talking
[84:26] about the actual technology in the
[84:28] gadgets it goes like complementing the
[84:31] technical Series so if I've been talking
[84:32] about Keys then I talked about uh like
[84:35] uh key sto key storage systems now I'm
[84:38] going to do the what is a wallet episode
[84:40] where I'm going to talk just technical
[84:42] then I'm going to do the Keystone I'm
[84:43] going to do the Jade then I'm going to
[84:45] talk about what is a node then I'm going
[84:47] to do like running a node so so I'm
[84:49] doing the technical like Hand by hand
[84:51] with the gadgets and then on the other
[84:53] side we're doing like news and
[84:54] noteworthy and cultural which is like I
[84:58] do I covered like the Copa case or like
[85:01] these interviews are more like the
[85:03] cultural section because bit Bitcoin has
[85:06] so many facets I couldn't really like
[85:08] narrow it down to like one thing so I
[85:11] just had one podcast with multiple
[85:13] series and and and the fifth one is
[85:15] going to be in Spanish but in Spanish
[85:16] it's weird because you kind of have to
[85:18] do all four right we're still going to
[85:19] have technical talks we're still going
[85:21] to have philosophical talks so we'll see
[85:24] we'll see see how it plays out I'm not
[85:25] totally sure but going back to your show
[85:28] I do have a couple questions before we
[85:31] finish which is uh what have been your
[85:34] top 10 or top five favorite interviews
[85:37] that's one one and the other one is what
[85:40] is your wish list or like a couple names
[85:42] on your wish list that you still haven't
[85:44] gotten to
[85:46] grasp um I think I start with the wish
[85:48] list uh I made it publicly that I want I
[85:52] have this goal to have 300 interviews
[85:56] this year at least uh I might go over
[86:00] 300 because I'm doing it daily now I
[86:03] think if I'm continuing daily and I'm
[86:06] exceeding like I'm will end up at like
[86:08] 310 320 or something like that uh I'm
[86:11] really passionate about doing over
[86:13] 300 uh and I would love the 200th guest
[86:18] to be cyer mo and the 300th guest
[86:21] Michael saor uh but I did not even reach
[86:23] out to that so like they could not even
[86:26] they did not even have the chance to say
[86:28] yes to me but I will do it soon with s
[86:31] Mo and then a little later with with
[86:34] with Michael sailor and I would love to
[86:36] have them on the podcast uh just because
[86:40] like Michael sailor and and C Mo are the
[86:44] one one of the most influential guys in
[86:46] the early days on my Bitcoin fing and I
[86:50] got it uh right now I'm not listening to
[86:52] them because I consumed them so much
[86:56] that uh I kind of when I listen to
[86:58] Michael S interview it kind of gets
[87:00] boring nowadays for me uh that's why I
[87:03] like to listen to new guys that's why I
[87:04] also invite a lot of new guys in uh my
[87:08] top five that's like really hard uh of
[87:12] of the current interviews I love the
[87:14] interview of Gary cordone uh not because
[87:17] of the Bitcoin aspect because he's just
[87:21] a 66 year old guy who has a lot of life
[87:24] experience and you you you you get the
[87:27] Au authenticity and this I don't care
[87:30] about anything kind of a wipe uh which
[87:33] is uh really really uh interesting to
[87:36] see and it was like a fun experience uh
[87:40] uh to to have then uh the the second I
[87:44] would put a lot of guys and and
[87:48] unfortunately I don't have too many
[87:50] girls on I would love to have you on my
[87:52] my podcast because if if I scroll
[87:54] through my my guest list it's
[87:57] like girl girl it's like I try to I try
[88:01] to have as many uh women also on as
[88:05] possible but uh coming back to the
[88:08] question two I would get um like the the
[88:12] the people like Luke uh the people uh
[88:16] from I forgot his name this he was my
[88:19] third guest and he said Bitcoin is a
[88:22] system based on love I never heard that
[88:24] before and I really yes love okay and I
[88:29] led it and how and how he explained it
[88:31] also and he was never on other podcast
[88:34] than mine and I Lov his explanation I
[88:37] loved how he he's talking about like on
[88:39] the second place I would put like two
[88:42] three of of them who just like really
[88:46] had an an amazing few and I didn't knew
[88:50] it before like because they don't don't
[88:52] put out a lot of tweets
[88:55] uh they don't have any YouTube channels
[88:57] they were never on a podcast so like
[88:59] what do you know about this the the
[89:00] persons like nothing and I was just
[89:03] going onto those podcasts with not a lot
[89:05] of questions because how do you prepare
[89:09] for a podcast where there's nothing
[89:10] online and I just like open like hi how
[89:13] you doing uh let's go through your
[89:15] Bitcoin story and then it goes in the
[89:18] directions that that you see uh and
[89:21] those are the the stories and those are
[89:23] the podcasts that actually like like the
[89:25] most honestly because they are
[89:27] completely
[89:29] um they are so new and they're so like
[89:33] they have some sometimes opinions they
[89:35] like really have to think about them if
[89:38] if Jeff Bo is saying something I don't
[89:40] really have to think about it because I
[89:42] heard it 20 times before uh even even
[89:45] with Gary Kone it was nothing new I I
[89:48] listen to a lot of podcast of his before
[89:50] what he does and what he thinks uh it
[89:52] was a little more interesting because
[89:54] he's really early n the Bitcoin
[89:56] community and he he he's not fully there
[90:00] as as as Jeff boies and as as marich and
[90:04] all the other bigger ones and natal Li
[90:06] pronel natal Li pronel I also want to
[90:08] highlight because she has a different
[90:11] kind of energy I love it I love how
[90:13] she's talking H but she's a lot on like
[90:16] Fox News and all those channels and I
[90:19] think she's really used to having like
[90:21] only like five minutes time or like 2
[90:23] minutes time time to talk about
[90:25] something and it it was overwhelming for
[90:27] me her amazing energy where she's like
[90:30] straightforward really good in speaking
[90:33] really good in speaking in a high energy
[90:36] way I'm like was overwhelming for me I
[90:41] felt a little bit uh the the
[90:43] overwhelming it I L the interview I I
[90:45] watched it already twice even though
[90:48] twice after it came out because her was
[90:51] amazing uh before I watched it like
[90:53] three times for editing and stuff like
[90:55] that uh so Jeff poof I already mentioned
[90:59] uh this was a big one for me because it
[91:02] personally impacted me even though
[91:04] content wise I did not learn a lot of
[91:06] new stuff uh but personally it was
[91:09] really really really cool for me uh
[91:11] let's see if I can find another example
[91:15] that was amazing I mean okay I have to
[91:18] men like the first one that I ever did
[91:21] uh the story of the first podcast is
[91:22] always amazing because
[91:24] you don't like I
[91:28] think Mr Beast says it the first 100
[91:31] videos you're doing you don't have any
[91:33] clue what you're doing H and I I I feel
[91:37] like that is really true because with
[91:39] every like 20 episodes I'm doing I'm
[91:41] feeling so dumb what I did like 20
[91:43] episodes ago uh and and I'm I'm slowly
[91:48] getting to point where I'm like okay I
[91:51] know a little bit like I know 2% what it
[91:54] takes to be a good host of a a podcast
[91:57] maybe 2% I know when we have like 100%
[92:00] we have like CH Rog Lex Freedman uh from
[92:03] outside of Bitcoin inside of Bitcoin P
[92:05] mccom that has has done a lot of
[92:08] interviews Preston Bish is I think also
[92:10] really good natal Brunell is also really
[92:12] good like when those are like between 80
[92:14] and 100% I think I'm like at 2% of of of
[92:17] skill level and I have to learn a lot
[92:20] more and that's why I'm also doing it
[92:21] like whole my life and when we talk
[92:23] about like 300 episodes a year about in
[92:27] the next like 80 years a lot of episodes
[92:30] a lot of really looking forward to my
[92:33] episodes when I'm like 90 years
[92:35] old it was good that you like picked a
[92:38] very precise like Focus to do it with
[92:41] interviews because then like
[92:44] um it it keeps it very like uh channeled
[92:48] you have a
[92:50] very like focused mindset and so you can
[92:53] like Barrel towards that goal very
[92:56] coherently for me it's harder because
[92:59] like for example technical episodes
[93:01] don't perform very well because um
[93:03] they're for like a very
[93:05] educational
[93:07] sweetheart thank you they're for
[93:10] educational purposes so it like um it
[93:14] takes time for people to catch on or
[93:16] it's just a resource for people the ones
[93:18] that perform the best are when you're
[93:19] talking about what's happening at this
[93:21] moment with the controversy of like
[93:24] what's happening at the moment so like
[93:26] any interview with anybody who's
[93:27] involved in
[93:29] any situation that is unfolding as
[93:32] you're going is going to be a huge
[93:35] success and I'm 100% I love uh doing the
[93:38] podcast and uh doing like every day the
[93:42] podcast having new people on it's it's
[93:46] something that I'm really grateful to
[93:48] have and I'm wondering why I did not
[93:51] start it earlier now uh but yeah I
[93:54] needed time like I went into Bitcoin I
[93:57] think um when we go into how I grew like
[94:01] how I came into Bitcoin in the Bitcoin
[94:04] Community like in 2023 I started my
[94:08] Twitter account uh where I'm like really
[94:11] every day I'm I will I publish something
[94:13] I had back then I think 300 followers or
[94:16] maybe 400 or something like that now I'm
[94:19] at 11,000 something uh one year later
[94:22] and and now I'm like like since December
[94:24] I'm also starting the podcast I had like
[94:27] 200 followers on on YouTube in January
[94:30] now I have like over 3,000 and it's it's
[94:33] uh just overwhelming for me that people
[94:35] are actually deciding to listening to me
[94:39] it's it's it's still like I cannot I
[94:43] can't I I just don't get the point like
[94:46] people deciding and also I don't know if
[94:48] you look to the YouTube statistics a lot
[94:50] but you get the metric how many hour was
[94:54] in toal people inside of your video uh
[94:59] and uh when I released the last episode
[95:02] with Gary Kone it was like first four
[95:04] hours 800 hours were spent in my videos
[95:07] in the first four
[95:10] hours a a lot of hours spent in the in
[95:13] the videos and I think the best episodes
[95:15] with Jeff PO with Peter D with Gary Kor
[95:19] with other people they like thousands of
[95:21] hours in this video alone
[95:24] uh and even uh Bad episodes get like 500
[95:27] 400 700 uh total watch time hours and
[95:31] I'm like I'm feeling so humbl that
[95:34] people give me that time and that's why
[95:37] I'm really passionate about making the
[95:39] video as good as I possibly can with the
[95:41] trailer with the edits I try to if if
[95:45] there's something weird in the voice of
[95:46] the guest I'm trying with adob enhanced
[95:49] speech with with getting the speech a
[95:51] little bit better and enhancing the
[95:52] audio uh because if people are willing
[95:55] to invest so much time in me I should
[95:58] invest like money in my resources to
[96:00] make it as good as I possibly can and I
[96:03] try to get better with every episode
[96:05] that's why I last week just bought a
[96:08] camera to look uh make it a little bit
[96:10] more uh soing it's not as bright it's a
[96:14] little bit more dark I have like a LED
[96:16] light there I have now
[96:19] the best microphone I could find the the
[96:22] the the short
[96:24] from what Jo Joe Rogan I think almost
[96:27] every big podcast users and these are
[96:30] all Investments that I make for
[96:33] basically because people are willing to
[96:36] invest time in my podcast I have to pay
[96:39] back the the this trust and this uh time
[96:43] that people are paying me forward so
[96:46] like I'm I'm also my sound proofing my
[96:49] sister I don't know if you saw a tweet
[96:50] of mine yesterday the day before I have
[96:53] egg boxes standing here and
[96:57] uh think blanket is coming down here so
[97:01] my voice is not like a Reverb because my
[97:04] room is like a Artic and so the the the
[97:09] the voice is really bad if I don't have
[97:11] those things and um I'm trying to invest
[97:13] more and more into the quality of the
[97:15] content because when people invest the
[97:17] time I should invest in in the quality
[97:20] of the content and bitcoiners have 10
[97:23] tendency to be to reward uh hard work
[97:27] like proof of work is a big thing in the
[97:29] medium so if if you invest your time
[97:33] into producing a high quality product
[97:36] and this is recognized by the community
[97:38] then the community will offer a lot of
[97:40] support back so uh I think your success
[97:44] is also a reflection of the fact that
[97:46] you're the that the community is
[97:48] appreciating what you're doing that the
[97:50] that there is an audience for your work
[97:54] that it is like high quality so I
[97:57] wouldn't worry too much about the little
[97:59] technical
[98:00] details in the at the end of the day
[98:02] what the reason people are following you
[98:04] is because they respect like the content
[98:07] and the people you're bringing on board
[98:08] the effort you're making you know
[98:10] they're very low time preference so
[98:12] they're okay with things taking a little
[98:13] bit longer if in the end you're going to
[98:15] deliver something that that's worth the
[98:18] wayn yeah definitely and I think it's
[98:21] important to note that I'm really just
[98:24] getting started like I'm um the podcast
[98:26] is not even four months old or is it now
[98:28] four months old I think it's now exactly
[98:30] four months old because I started on
[98:32] 28th of November December January
[98:36] February
[98:39] April Yeah March I'm I lost March it's
[98:43] five months old actually right now I
[98:45] forgot the march to to count uh yeah
[98:48] it's five months old exactly now and I'm
[98:51] I'm I'm really like I'm I'm humbled by
[98:53] by by the feedback I got from the
[98:55] Bitcoin Community uh but I'm just
[98:57] getting like started it's it's it's
[98:59] fascinating for me that people are like
[99:01] signing up for channel memberships on
[99:03] YouTube uh to pay me monthly uh people
[99:06] are giving me money on value for value
[99:08] for Fountain uh and and all all those
[99:11] weird stuff for me that I cannot really
[99:14] comprehend but people are actually
[99:16] paying for a free product that is out
[99:18] there uh after the fact so it's it's
[99:21] fascinating to see the Bitcoin community
[99:23] the rewarding as you said hard work and
[99:26] the proof of work and I'm doing my best
[99:28] but um I'm not even a half year in so
[99:31] like I'm I'm a a Bitcoin podcast newbie
[99:33] and and I'm I'm trying to to pay my way
[99:36] I have one last question for you before
[99:38] we go so it's similar to what you do so
[99:42] you at the end of your episodes you ask
[99:43] your guests to uh ask a question for the
[99:47] next guest so my question for you was
[99:51] like what question has been the most
[99:53] interesting or what question would you
[99:56] wish they asked that they haven't asked
[99:58] something about the questions you asked
[100:00] because I found that really endearing I
[100:02] I like that one um f first of all I
[100:05] stole that from the Diary of a CEO like
[100:07] this was not my idea uh D see also a
[100:12] podcast outside of Bitcoin that I really
[100:13] like to listen to um now there's a
[100:16] little less but I really love to to
[100:18] listen it last year uh and uh he just
[100:23] make the same thing that I'm making he's
[100:25] making I just copied it 100% and I loved
[100:28] it so much that I was like I have to
[100:30] copy that I tried to put my own spin on
[100:33] it but I did not like my own spin on it
[100:37] so I just copied it uh and I also
[100:39] thought it is amazing for the Bitcoin
[100:41] Community because it goes back to this
[100:43] blockchain thing where the guests are
[100:46] interconnected to each other where the
[100:48] guest is pointing with the next with a
[100:51] question to the next guest like in the
[100:53] blockchain they're pointing to the next
[100:55] blocks so I I love that uh that it's
[100:59] it's suiting so well uh and yeah but I
[101:03] just want to noted that I just copied
[101:05] that and I love it uh um uh what what
[101:09] the question uh what's the most
[101:12] interesting question yeah uh what that
[101:15] you wish people would ask but they
[101:16] haven't or so yes which question would
[101:19] you like to highlight from that from
[101:22] that I love the the rudimental questions
[101:26] like what is freedom that came up or
[101:30] even the outside of Bitcoin questions I
[101:32] always like for example um the question
[101:36] that I liked a lot is like what is the
[101:38] daily habit that you love and would not
[101:42] live without that one daily habit that
[101:44] you do uh this also an interesting thing
[101:48] that Sparks interesting conversations
[101:50] like basically I actually like when they
[101:52] ask asking uh questions a little bit
[101:55] outside of Bitcoin because Bitcoin is
[101:58] well well covered in in my my podcast
[102:01] usually and uh usually like when it's a
[102:05] Bitcoin question uh it's it's covered
[102:08] already before that like a little bit
[102:11] even so when I see the question
[102:13] obviously I know the question before we
[102:16] get in the interview uh so I try to get
[102:19] around that question so it's not covered
[102:21] in the podcast but sometimes it's hard
[102:23] because the the guest gets where the
[102:25] guest gets like I I don't try to to
[102:27] guide the guest I just try to be like
[102:29] the get the best side of out of the
[102:32] guest as as
[102:33] possible uh and yeah it's fascinating
[102:36] for me to see that uh uh more and more
[102:40] questions are getting outside of Bitcoin
[102:42] uh and then there are some questions uh
[102:45] that are really technical uh that's
[102:48] sometimes interesting I think one
[102:49] question I also want to highlight uh
[102:52] that's why I now started to like not
[102:55] reveal who the next guest is to the
[102:57] guest like I having like asking a
[103:01] question for the next guest without
[103:02] knowing who the next guest is uh
[103:07] because the it it was it was already
[103:10] misused as a as a question that that
[103:15] Asen from from uh the relay the social
[103:19] uh he's the social media lead leaders
[103:21] from relay he knew that the next guest
[103:24] uh and he was like I was asking for the
[103:27] next like why are you
[103:29] bold and I I loved it because they knew
[103:32] each other really good like they had a
[103:33] really friendly thing going on they
[103:36] loved it and it was uh we made a clip
[103:38] about that uh but for me I I that's why
[103:42] I started not reveal who the next guest
[103:46] is to to get it like fresh because when
[103:49] I reveal who the next guest is uh then
[103:52] people think of this person and try to
[103:55] tailor a question to him and this is not
[103:58] like where it should go it should like
[103:59] be like completely completely new like
[104:02] why is uh uh like what is freedom what's
[104:06] your daily habit like um what else was
[104:09] in there but there like um a question
[104:12] that nobody asked till now uh um nobody
[104:15] asked till now why Bitcoin for some
[104:19] reason uh why why Bitcoin never nobody
[104:23] ever asked on on the podcast why are you
[104:26] actually in Bitcoin but it's it's fair
[104:28] because I I usually cover that in the
[104:31] podcast uh and the thing that I like to
[104:36] have like I started asking that a lot of
[104:37] my guests uh and nobody ever asked that
[104:41] in the in the in the the end of the in
[104:45] the end routine of the question uh I
[104:47] started to ask the guests what are you
[104:49] currently really passionate about
[104:52] besides Bitcoin
[104:54] uh because I think Bitcoin is doing so
[104:56] many great stuff and we can learn from
[104:59] that as a Bitcoin Community what they
[105:01] are doing outside of Bitcoin uh and from
[105:04] that so that's like to the end I'm more
[105:08] and more getting this question in not
[105:10] with every guest uh but with more and
[105:12] more nobody ever asked that because I
[105:14] think it's an interesting question to
[105:16] think about okay right now what are you
[105:18] learning what your audiobooks your
[105:20] podcasts what are they about because
[105:22] this is changing for me all the time
[105:24] like like one year I had a whole
[105:26] different thing that I'm currently right
[105:29] now because right now I'm starting a
[105:30] podcast obviously I'm I'm listening a
[105:32] lot to like uh what is important for
[105:34] podcast how do I make like a brand out
[105:38] of a podcast how can I scale it what is
[105:40] personal branding like because I I have
[105:42] to know all about that to get the
[105:45] Bitcoin message out there uh the BET be
[105:48] coming back to the the earlier things
[105:49] that we said about the the the best way
[105:52] to P people the best way for me to get
[105:55] the the Bitcoin message out there is if
[105:57] my podcast is really
[105:59] big like as long as like I would not
[106:02] care too much about that my podcast is
[106:05] really big but that's the best way for
[106:07] me to get the Bitcoin uh message out
[106:10] there and maybe even so big that it's a
[106:12] little bit outside of of of Bitcoin
[106:15] that's why I I started uh this also
[106:17] didn't cover a lot I started naming the
[106:21] podcast the Bitcoin path
[106:24] uh and then I decided after like 10 or
[106:27] 20 episodes to not give it any name just
[106:31] name the podcast nothing like it's just
[106:34] Robin S it's like just my name and I
[106:37] made this decision really uh consciously
[106:41] because I want to talk about anything
[106:43] I'm currently passionate about I think
[106:45] the next 10 years will be about Bitcoin
[106:47] the next 10 years of the podcast will be
[106:49] primarily about Bitcoin uh but even if
[106:52] it goes Beyond Bitcoin because at some
[106:55] point uh it's sometimes hard to think
[106:58] about that but at some point Bitcoin
[106:59] will be boring because everybody will
[107:01] use it it will be the base lay of our
[107:03] financial system uh and it will be like
[107:06] we are talking about the tcpip protocol
[107:09] who cares what the
[107:11] TCP everybody uses it everybody when you
[107:14] send like messages on on on on on the
[107:17] phone when you send anything uh there is
[107:21] always the TCP P protocol somewhere
[107:25] connected with it but nobody has a
[107:28] podcast about it because it's boring and
[107:30] Bitcoin will also be
[107:32] boring I I I actually asked this myself
[107:35] this question like a similar question
[107:38] and it comes to that this idea that
[107:40] Bitcoin is just money so like sometimes
[107:42] I struggle with this idea because my
[107:44] daughter is like Mom why are you always
[107:46] talking about Bitcoin are we going to go
[107:48] see your Bitcoin
[107:50] friends so
[107:53] I'm like okay what's going on but then I
[107:57] but it is a little bit because it's a
[107:58] new technology we're like redefining
[108:01] what money means so it's kind of fair
[108:03] that it's about Bitcoin because I do
[108:05] wonder sometimes like Bitcoin is just
[108:08] the Bitcoin is just the tool that we are
[108:10] going to use to do all kinds of other
[108:13] things so right now we're really like
[108:15] focused on the tool but really like what
[108:18] is the tool allowing us to then go and
[108:21] do so I you're taking that approach
[108:24] that's a great U take on that whole
[108:26] situation yeah I just could not decide a
[108:29] name and I was like then let's not name
[108:31] it at
[108:33] all my YouTube is just Robin S my thing
[108:37] is also Robin S like you can find it
[108:39] with Robin sire uh there's actually when
[108:42] you uh Google Robin sire podcast there's
[108:46] another Robin S podcast coming up it's
[108:48] called
[108:49] robcast uh it's it's not my current
[108:52] podcast it was a podcast of my past it's
[108:55] in German uh and I cannot delete it for
[108:59] some
[109:00] reason that one of my questions but I
[109:03] didn't like kind of there there we still
[109:04] have a minute to maybe discuss it why do
[109:07] you choose to do English instead of uh
[109:09] German for
[109:11] example uh that's uh I get that ask a
[109:14] lot in the comments uh people even say
[109:17] like you I should do German because for
[109:20] some reason they want to to have it in
[109:22] German
[109:23] but I don't care for that uh and I don't
[109:27] care for that a specific reason because
[109:29] I think we have a lot of great content
[109:32] creators in the German area we have blog
[109:35] trainer we have S degree we have really
[109:38] like I think five six Bitcoin only
[109:41] podcast in German I don't know how it is
[109:43] in Spain and other languages but in
[109:46] German we're really great represented
[109:50] there is no need that that everybody
[109:53] like there's always a need for more
[109:54] stuff and we can always saturate the
[109:57] market more and there can always be
[109:58] another Bitcoin podcast in that language
[110:01] and it's the more the better but there
[110:04] is not like oh there's not one we even
[110:08] have Nico y I completely forgot about
[110:10] them he's he's Austrian he's doing a
[110:11] great job uh and uh there's so many
[110:15] great Austrian German withs content
[110:18] creators that doing only German content
[110:22] uh where like it's not like there's a a
[110:25] hole in the market and there's no
[110:27] Bitcoin podcast like niiko yil he
[110:30] invites really cool people he has an
[110:32] in-person Studio he's doing extremely
[110:35] professional he's now partnering up with
[110:37] a football team in Austria he's like a
[110:39] whole another level he's really good
[110:41] block trainer I love him he's on the um
[110:45] Bitcoin stage also in brag uh like there
[110:48] are really good people in Germany in
[110:51] German and
[110:53] there are also a lot a lot more uh in
[110:56] English than in German but there there
[110:59] are really great people in English also
[111:02] so for me uh I got to take this decision
[111:07] freely because I know there are a lot of
[111:10] great Bitcoin podcasts in English there
[111:12] are a lot of great Bitcoin podcasts in
[111:13] German so there is no need for me to
[111:16] fill any hole in any Market really I
[111:19] just can find my own space and uh I
[111:23] worked in the company where I primarily
[111:26] uh talked uh English uh with my clients
[111:30] because my client was in in in France uh
[111:33] I have an Indian girlfriend uh which uh
[111:36] she does not know German like she
[111:39] understands some German but she cannot
[111:41] really speak German so I talk with her
[111:44] every day in English because I also
[111:46] don't know
[111:47] Hindi uh even though I'm trying to learn
[111:50] a little bit but it's not an easy
[111:52] language for me
[111:53] uh so we talk every day in English I
[111:56] have like 50% of my friends are from
[111:58] like America England from wherever so I
[112:02] talk with them uh English and not German
[112:05] like even like some of my friends are
[112:07] English and not German so for me English
[112:10] it's not mother language level but I can
[112:13] speak it without thinking about it and I
[112:16] even uh went on a kind of an English
[112:19] Standard in my private life where when
[112:22] when I set up a new system when I set up
[112:25] new phone everything is English like
[112:27] everything that I set up is is in
[112:29] English uh and then I only was like um
[112:34] what what what do I want to do because I
[112:36] can speak in German and I can speak in
[112:38] English that there's no difference for
[112:40] me in there and then there are two
[112:43] aspects that are now was we deciding for
[112:46] me the first aspect is not all German is
[112:50] German uh if I speak in the Austrian
[112:53] dialect some German don't even
[112:55] understand this uh and it's
[112:58] uncomfortable for me to speak in the
[113:00] high German
[113:02] language uh the high standard of of
[113:05] German it's like the the German that the
[113:08] German speak and the German that the
[113:10] Austrian speaks is a little different
[113:12] even though the basis is the same H I
[113:15] feel more comfortable in English than
[113:18] the high standard of German and if I
[113:20] have a German speaking podcast I br
[113:22] probably have to speak in the high uh
[113:27] High language of of German because then
[113:30] like Germany doesn't understand me the
[113:31] Swiss does not understand me then it's
[113:33] just an Austrian podcast and it's really
[113:35] small uh and this was one of the smaller
[113:39] aspects but the bigger aspects is um I
[113:43] want to talk with people all over the
[113:46] world I don't only want to talk with a
[113:50] and this is the most uh important part
[113:54] because if I have a German uh um podcast
[113:58] we're not uh there yet with AI
[114:01] translation where we can real time
[114:04] translate it really good so English is
[114:07] the kind of the middle standard uh and
[114:09] when you only talk with German austrians
[114:11] like Germans Austrian Swiss they are in
[114:13] like the western civilization they think
[114:15] the same way kind of they have a similar
[114:18] way of living obviously people are
[114:20] different but uh you get where I'm going
[114:23] like they're in a similar region so I
[114:25] had Indians on I had Africans on I had
[114:29] people from America on Australia on
[114:31] Canada on I had so many different parts
[114:35] of the world already on my podcast that
[114:37] I did not wanted to miss out and only
[114:40] 10% right around that number of my
[114:43] podcast are actually German speaking
[114:46] people that I forced to speak English
[114:48] with me even though some of them did not
[114:50] like it uh but uh I forced them to do it
[114:53] because I want to have this Bitcoin
[114:56] standard I might I might uh if I uh if I
[115:02] have a great Bitcoin English podcast I
[115:04] might do a second channel uh and either
[115:08] if AI translation is good translate all
[115:10] my podcast episodes in in in German with
[115:14] AI so people can easily get it because
[115:16] there are some bitcoiners that are not
[115:19] comfortable with hearing English uh or
[115:22] just don't know English that well and I
[115:24] want to uh get them access to my English
[115:26] FES or even if AI translation is not
[115:30] good I might just start interviewing
[115:32] some of the Germans again in German for
[115:36] a second Channel but I probably don't do
[115:39] that I probably do the AI translation uh
[115:41] but it's it's a possibility but right
[115:43] now I'm just focused on the English
[115:45] podcast and doing that and the biggest
[115:47] reason is for me speaking with the guest
[115:50] uh all over the world
[115:52] yeah your decision process was a little
[115:54] bit different for
[115:55] me uh from mine I think it's very
[115:59] interesting how you came to that
[116:01] decision and uh because you're focused
[116:03] in interviewing people and English is
[116:05] like a more universal language that you
[116:07] can use to communicate with different
[116:09] people I think for me it's a little bit
[116:11] different
[116:12] because with Spanish it's a little it's
[116:14] not like with German there isn't so much
[116:17] high quality content specifically about
[116:20] Bitcoin in Spanish there are some like
[116:23] good
[116:24] Bitcoin um podcasters and BTC sessions
[116:28] just put out a little seminar in Spanish
[116:30] I was quite uh
[116:32] impressed but I I think in when it comes
[116:36] to Spanish there is kind of a hole in
[116:37] the
[116:38] market um and it's not just for money
[116:42] reasons it's more so for educational
[116:43] reasons like there is a void that isn't
[116:46] being failed in terms of providing a
[116:47] service to these communities that they
[116:49] can access like some resources and get
[116:51] informed about the tools and the culture
[116:54] and the technology in Spanish the the
[116:57] part that is like hard for me that is
[117:00] kind of why You Picked English is that
[117:02] it's very hard to bring people on your
[117:04] podcast to interview them in Spanish
[117:07] because there isn't that many
[117:08] Spanish-speaking people who are like at
[117:10] that level that will be like a a Natalie
[117:13] Brunell in Spanish you know so I've been
[117:16] thinking of ways of delivering this
[117:19] information to the ibera American
[117:21] community
[117:23] different like to make it I think EI
[117:26] translation will be soon really good and
[117:29] I think it will be uh consumable and it
[117:32] will be really good like maybe in a year
[117:34] maybe in five years I don't know what
[117:35] the time span is I even saw some some
[117:39] bigger podcast already experimenting
[117:41] with that and offering the English
[117:43] podcast in two three other languages on
[117:46] different channels with AI translations
[117:49] uh I mean you have to spend money on
[117:52] that there are tools they're working a
[117:54] lot they usual utilizing a lot of
[117:57] processing power so they are not
[117:59] inexpensive uh but I think at some point
[118:03] it doesn't matter what language you're
[118:05] uploading the user of let's say YouTube
[118:08] can just choose oh I want to consume
[118:10] that in my local language in Spanish I
[118:12] want to use it in French in in in German
[118:15] in whatever and YouTube does from the
[118:19] source to every other language I know if
[118:22] we're there in 10 years 20 years or five
[118:24] years or probably not one year uh but I
[118:27] think at some point language does not
[118:31] matter that much because AI translation
[118:34] and Innovation tools are just that good
[118:37] with in with translating to every
[118:39] language yeah and I think it's also
[118:41] about speaking the person's language
[118:44] like not their actual language but their
[118:46] language culturally and their language
[118:48] financially because I think the reason
[118:50] why it's easy for you to speak English
[118:52] or German is because between the
[118:55] Americans or the British or the Germans
[118:57] or the austrians there's going to be a
[118:59] huge overlap in terms of the tools that
[119:01] are available the resources that are
[119:03] available the points of view are going
[119:05] to be similar similar life experiences
[119:08] and that doesn't translate very well for
[119:09] South Americans South Americans don't
[119:11] feel like represented sometimes in those
[119:15] discussions and those experiences so I
[119:17] think more so than the literal language
[119:20] the reason why AI can't really fill that
[119:22] Gap it can at a technical level but it
[119:25] it can't really fill the Gap because you
[119:28] need the the person to be communicating
[119:32] in terms of life experiences that those
[119:34] audience members can also relate to but
[119:37] yeah it'll be very interesting to see
[119:38] like where this whole AI future
[119:41] goes yeah yeah I was I was just talking
[119:44] obviously about the language itself like
[119:48] just like the words translated so like
[119:50] the same thing that basically the
[119:53] American series are doing with all the
[119:55] different languages where they just have
[119:58] someone speaking over them uh so like uh
[120:02] I don't know the Big Bang Theory for
[120:04] example from
[120:05] America there a German German Voice
[120:08] version of that where some actual German
[120:10] person is speaking over that and and
[120:13] doing the jokes also differently and
[120:15] stuff like that so I think we will get
[120:17] to that kind ofal level where AI uh can
[120:22] do it as good as a human I can translate
[120:25] it uh because I'm also like fascinating
[120:28] when I I switch sometimes with j gbt in
[120:32] Austrian dialect and he's like speak
[120:35] with me as you would be someone from
[120:38] this Austrian small region and I'm like
[120:40] what he's actually texting exactly as an
[120:44] Austrian would do uh so I think just at
[120:47] an language level will be uh there then
[120:51] it will be interesting if AI can also
[120:53] like translate jokes and stuff like that
[120:56] because as you said a joke in America is
[121:00] different than a joke in India and is
[121:02] different than a joke in Austria is
[121:04] different than a joke in in Latin
[121:06] America so that will be interesting to
[121:09] see if they can uh have a similar choke
[121:13] that also Latin Americans uh and see but
[121:17] I have no clue honestly I just I just
[121:20] hope that at one point I press release
[121:22] and my English podcast gets to everybody
[121:24] and everybody understands it but I'm
[121:26] just
[121:27] hopeful all right um why don't we close
[121:31] since we didn't um answer the question
[121:33] why Bitcoin why don't you we close with
[121:35] a little statement of why you think
[121:39] people should Bitcoin why
[121:40] Bitcoin there are two aspects to it the
[121:43] first one is the one that people in the
[121:46] west are really concerned about is
[121:48] number gr technology they want to have
[121:51] more financial gain from it uh and yes
[121:54] you will have this 100% uh Bitcoin will
[121:57] rip all other assets apart in the next
[122:00] 10 years it will be not funny uh people
[122:04] people will attack Bitcoin because they
[122:06] will be envy of it uh people will attack
[122:08] bitcoiners because they will be envy of
[122:10] bitcoiners uh and people will be EXT
[122:14] Bitcoin will be extremely high before
[122:15] forming asset over the next 10 maybe
[122:17] even 20 years uh because we are just
[122:20] seeing like we have this
[122:22] 3% uh adoption rate and once we hit may
[122:26] maybe like a five six% uh number can
[122:29] vary depending on what metrics you use
[122:31] but once we hit this 10% Like This S
[122:34] curve adoption uh it will take maybe 10
[122:37] years from 10% till we hit to to the 80
[122:41] 90% so uh this complete fomo this
[122:44] complete uh price appreciation level uh
[122:47] will hit sooner than most people think
[122:51] and harder than most people think and
[122:54] even bitcoiners I think even me we are
[122:56] not ready for the enorm price
[122:59] appreciation that's why I'm saying so
[123:01] much get self- custody be ready for it
[123:04] uh exchanges will be rck pulled uh try
[123:07] be be as self- soverign as you possibly
[123:09] can and then the second aspect to this
[123:11] is freedom go up technology H this is
[123:14] for
[123:15] everybody uh this is for everybody that
[123:18] is concerned about uh their government
[123:21] Maybe uh trying to limit their freedom
[123:25] uh in financial transactions uh maybe
[123:28] they are concerned about uh institutions
[123:30] uh trying their freedom in in some sort
[123:34] this is the part where you should really
[123:36] get passionate about the first part you
[123:38] can also do with with Stock Investing
[123:41] maybe picking some stocks or investing
[123:43] in your own company or something like
[123:45] that but what you cannot do is the
[123:48] second part Freedom go up technology uh
[123:51] it's it's something that is freeing so
[123:53] many people uh from uh from from
[123:57] different countries where they obviously
[124:00] all of the sudden they can give money to
[124:02] someone uh I think a big part was also
[124:05] Canada the Canadian drug this was a a
[124:08] huge uh part of the Bitcoin history for
[124:11] me because this showed people that
[124:14] crowdfunding only works if you do it
[124:16] with Bitcoin tools if you do bit
[124:19] crowdfunding uh so these centralized
[124:22] crowdfunding with Fiat tools they will
[124:25] freeze the assets if they do it with
[124:28] Bitcoin with privacy in mind with self-
[124:30] custody in mind they cannot do anything
[124:33] from it and they even froze bank
[124:35] accounts from people that just gave uh
[124:38] those Canadian truckers money and I I
[124:41] don't care what you think about the
[124:43] Canadian truckers on what side you're
[124:44] politically on I don't care but it
[124:47] should never be an attack on the person
[124:51] that just wants to support financially a
[124:54] political group uh they should never be
[124:56] Frozen from the assets like this the the
[125:00] the financial energy of a person is
[125:02] their life's energy to a certain extent
[125:06] and you should never as a political
[125:09] group attack that but they will attack
[125:12] it and it's just a matter of time they
[125:14] they you are on the wrong side of
[125:17] government or you in the in the on a
[125:19] country where you are on the wrong side
[125:21] of government
[125:22] so why not protect yourself from that if
[125:25] you also get the free number go up
[125:27] technology like you get both in one
[125:29] thing uh and I think this is the the
[125:33] short uh short elevator pitch that I
[125:36] usually give to people if if they ask me
[125:39] why Bitcoin and then there's usually
[125:42] like 20 things that they think that
[125:44] Bitcoin isn't working on coming and then
[125:47] I'm saying okay uh if if if you're not
[125:50] convinced uh go
[125:52] verify yourself go study yourself I
[125:55] don't care if you get Bitcoin if you
[125:56] don't get Bitcoin it benefits me because
[125:59] then the adoption is slower then I can
[126:01] buy more I'm 25 I want to buy a lot I
[126:04] want to buy a lot of Bitcoin I don't
[126:05] want to be rich now I want to be rich
[126:07] when I'm 65 years
[126:09] old yeah give us more time to stack
[126:11] stats and also there's this phrase where
[126:14] it's like people buy Bitcoin at the
[126:17] price that they deserve so if they
[126:19] reject it now and have to buy it later
[126:21] at a higher price it's kind of like you
[126:22] brought it upon yourself so that that
[126:25] creates a little friction but it's a
[126:27] very hard truth to
[126:29] swallow 100% And yeah I said like three
[126:32] years long I said Bitcoin is a scam I
[126:34] could picked up so many Bitcoins I don't
[126:38] even want to think about how many more
[126:40] Bitcoins I would had till compared to I
[126:43] have now I'm like always looking at my
[126:45] stack I'm like a this is this is
[126:48] too small I have not enough Bitcoin
[126:51] everybody celebrating the hobing and I'm
[126:52] over here like why are you celebrating
[126:55] [Laughter]
[126:59] gos cancel them let's have it in 10
[127:01] years only people who have too much
[127:03] Bitcoin are celebrating the
[127:06] hobing
[127:07] exactly well I'm really glad we ended
[127:09] with that question because I love this I
[127:11] had never heard it put in the in the
[127:13] words of Freedom go up technology I
