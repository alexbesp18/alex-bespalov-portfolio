[00:00] sooner or later it's going to be bigger
[00:01] than fiet and replace fiet there's
[00:03] nothing bad about the free market it
[00:04] will rise it will go to 250k there's a
[00:07] reason why you musk or M are rich not
[00:09] because of socialism because of
[00:10] capitalism all socialistic and
[00:12] communistic regimes and dictatorship
[00:13] Stalin ma North Korea Venezuela it
[00:16] doesn't work Germany has like 80 taxes
[00:18] why do we need all those taxes like
[00:20] where's that money even going to where
[00:21] are we are we in a communistic
[00:23] socialistic regime or are we in a
[00:25] western World which has democracy
[00:31] you are I think we talked about it
[00:33] before uh we talked about all my guests
[00:35] and I think you're actually my youngest
[00:37] guest ever on the podcast guest maybe we
[00:39] find someday someone under 19 you're 19
[00:42] years old and you accomplished something
[00:44] that a lot of podcasters already wanted
[00:46] to accomplish that are like 30 40 years
[00:48] old but they never had Michael saor on
[00:51] their show uh and you actually had
[00:53] Michael sa on your show right yes that's
[00:55] true
[00:56] um it was funny uh so originally I
[01:00] planned to interview like let's say 15
[01:03] people 13 people maybe maybe 16 and then
[01:06] I had the idea and also julan the CEO of
[01:09] relay that told me let's do 21 right and
[01:12] I interviewed 21 people in prog like
[01:14] short interviews like 10 minutes the
[01:16] longest was with julan that was like 17
[01:18] minutes because we talked a lot so uh um
[01:21] and I had Sailor Jack MERS Adam Beck all
[01:24] those people on my list which I wanted
[01:26] to and I knew s is going to be the
[01:28] hardest because know it's my M like
[01:30] people are always around him whenever he
[01:33] comes out of a a panel or a show or
[01:37] whatever they it's like it's like really
[01:39] like 10 people around him and he can't
[01:41] really escape and you have no there's no
[01:43] way that you can get to him and I was a
[01:45] little bit sneaky um I first asked his
[01:48] manager or one of his managers I think
[01:51] um if I could interview him like 5
[01:53] minutes that's all I need like short
[01:54] intervie right and he was like how old
[01:56] are you well I'm 19 I have a podcast
[01:59] then he and he looked at his other um
[02:02] the other managers and his uh PE and the
[02:04] other people and was like and you're 19
[02:06] and you have a podcast yeah okay let's
[02:08] do it Go and ask him maybe if he says
[02:10] yes you're lucky if he says no it's fine
[02:12] at least I tried right and I then went
[02:15] to Sor asked him and he was like yeah
[02:18] well what you going to want to talk
[02:19] about and I'm like Bitcoin obviously we
[02:22] we're in a Bitcoin conference what else
[02:23] should we talk about and you know and
[02:26] that was basically then he was like uh
[02:29] well he was thinking and then I was like
[02:31] unless you're afraid to and you don't
[02:32] want to it's fine if you don't want to
[02:35] I'm okay with no because no is no like
[02:37] like right it's it's a it's a it's a
[02:39] single single word it's no and um he
[02:42] then said you know what no let's go
[02:44] upstairs let's do it because he had like
[02:45] a room upstairs right um like where he
[02:48] could relax CU people were around him
[02:50] all day um yeah we went upstairs I did
[02:53] the interview like 5 minutes I didn't
[02:55] ask him like hard stuff I just asked him
[02:57] like uh why do you think we need Bitcoin
[02:59] now and you always say Bitcoin is for
[03:00] everyone is it truly for everyone those
[03:02] questions right and yeah that was
[03:05] basically that was basically it and I
[03:08] also had Jack MERS Adam Beck I had as I
[03:11] said Julian from the C of relay I had
[03:14] Cho Nakamoto or Jo Hall as he's called
[03:17] in in the normal British world
[03:21] uh yeah I had Isabella I had I had tons
[03:24] of people I don't even remember all of
[03:25] them but really cool what what did you
[03:27] take away from bitco brag and all those
[03:29] in views uh that everyone is
[03:32] different and that there's so much that
[03:37] you can cover now in the Bitcoin space
[03:38] there's not just Bitcoin itself and all
[03:41] the technical stuff and financial stuff
[03:43] and you have a rich guy called tler
[03:45] which tells us the 21 Rules right it's
[03:47] it's it's it's a whole Spectrum it's you
[03:49] can do arts with Bitcoin you can have a
[03:51] podcast with Bitcoin like like you have
[03:53] and I have um there's there's so much
[03:56] stuff now in the Bitcoin space it's not
[03:57] just I mean you do you remember remember
[04:00] like the videos and pictures of the
[04:01] first official conference like like like
[04:04] just one guy and then like three guys in
[04:07] like just listening to this one
[04:08] professor and now look at where we are
[04:10] like Nashville was a uh yesterday I
[04:13] think or two days ago yeah two days I
[04:16] mean yesterday it also was I started I
[04:18] think four days ago first day I mean
[04:22] thousands of people are like coming to a
[04:24] conference talking about one single
[04:26] thing and that's Bitcoin not Fiat not
[04:28] not shitcoins not ethereum not the Teter
[04:31] or whatever just Bitcoin right so um
[04:34] that that's what I would take away which
[04:36] there's like a whole Spectrum now with
[04:38] Bitcoin when I look at my audience I see
[04:41] the average age of 45 I see
[04:45] 12% are between 55 and 65 and 7% over
[04:51] 65 uh and when I look at other channels
[04:54] they are doing crypto things they're
[04:55] doing altcoin things they're doing mcoin
[04:57] things they usually have the younger
[04:58] crowd mhm so I feel like younger crowds
[05:01] especially 25 and under that so like I'm
[05:03] 25 you're 19 so we are uh kind of in the
[05:07] same generation um they this crowd is
[05:10] usually more in the altcoin sphere they
[05:12] are doing some meme coins some shitcoins
[05:15] as we call it why didn't you do that
[05:18] like why did you stick with
[05:21] Bitcoin the number one thing I learned
[05:23] in my family so my mom was an ex- Banker
[05:25] right uh so I kind of grew up in a
[05:28] capitalistic way although I look
[05:30] socialistic I mean you can Pro I mean
[05:32] the haircut tells you everything about
[05:33] me um no but I grew up in a capitalistic
[05:36] way and I grew up in a way that we
[05:39] learned there's a free market and the
[05:40] ones who work more and work smarter in a
[05:44] sense get you know they get what they
[05:46] want right and we always had those rules
[05:49] um if something costs like €100 you have
[05:52] €300 on the side so one for two for R
[05:55] right and that's how I grew up and I
[05:57] think maybe because of that I was was
[05:59] not attracted to those scams and I'm I'm
[06:02] going to call it a scam I mean if for me
[06:03] it's a scam because it's it's not a
[06:06] decentralized it's a centralized
[06:07] institution uh the guy behind it viik
[06:10] I'm not sure what's wrong with him he
[06:11] looks like a zombie to me but um so yeah
[06:15] I would say because I grew up in a
[06:17] capitalistic way maybe that's the reason
[06:20] but I just think nowadays my generation
[06:23] and maybe also your generation they're
[06:24] just stupid they're greedy they they
[06:26] want everything fast in life and that's
[06:29] also so funny all the elderly people
[06:32] like let's say above 30 40 50 I
[06:34] understand them I can talk to them so I
[06:36] can integrate myself into their View and
[06:39] perspective of how life is supposed to
[06:42] be and is you know I mean a guy who
[06:44] worked 50 years just you know to get
[06:49] where he is now like has a minimum rent
[06:51] has
[06:52] a I would say not a good life I mean
[06:54] Germany for example people um have to go
[06:57] on the streets and get like garbage from
[06:59] the street to make money with that right
[07:01] and I can I can understand those people
[07:03] and talk to those people so
[07:05] um that's what I would say people might
[07:07] actually are greedy and stupid
[07:10] so but you know it's it's life it's also
[07:13] interesting you brought up uh before we
[07:15] started recording a topic with Bitcoin
[07:17] and socialism and you definitely not a
[07:20] fan of socialism and you also said like
[07:22] you look a little bit like a socialist
[07:24] and I have to say yes you do yeah so but
[07:27] but let's like there so much to uncover
[07:30] there because uh first of all uh you
[07:33] said the Bitcoin Community is too
[07:36] socialist like why do you think that
[07:38] well um they always say tax are rich and
[07:41] uh
[07:42] uh they say eal Bitcoin is for everyone
[07:45] right um or equality or we also have
[07:49] some Bitcoins which are like into gender
[07:51] equality and you know that whole hbtq
[07:54] [ __ ] and I it trust me I I love math I
[07:57] love physics I love science and if you
[07:59] have a dick between your legs sorry for
[08:01] saying like that you're a man and if you
[08:02] have a [ __ ] between your legs you're a
[08:03] woman just I'm gonna I'm gonna stick
[08:06] with that statement sorry for saying
[08:07] like that and we have certain people
[08:09] which are socialistic because they
[08:11] always say tax rich and I'm like no
[08:12] don't tax rich I mean there's a reason
[08:14] why you mask for example M say are rich
[08:17] not because of socialism because of
[08:18] capitalism it's a free market and they
[08:20] got what they deserved and they worked
[08:22] hard for it right so
[08:23] um I just
[08:26] think maybe it's the space itself
[08:28] because we have satos Oto who created
[08:30] something that is fighting back against
[08:33] the system which for some people is
[08:35] capitalistic but for some people it's
[08:37] also communistic I mean look at ferine
[08:41] with am I'm not sure if you have heard
[08:42] about that but uh like it's like am is
[08:44] like a secret Finance police the U and
[08:47] vland wants to push AKA a
[08:51] digital I would say a digital
[08:53] communistic regime and so many people in
[08:57] the space are too socialistic because of
[09:00] Bitcoin and I think that Bitcoin
[09:05] nowadays isn't what it has been like
[09:08] let's say 10 years ago because 10 years
[09:09] ago was really this this jump on the
[09:11] train or you have lost and nowadays it's
[09:13] like yeah jump on the train but you have
[09:15] already lost because you have a system
[09:17] which already pushes digital IDs digital
[09:19] currencies digital [ __ ] cbcs whatever
[09:23] and because of that people are like oh
[09:25] no [ __ ] the government [ __ ] the
[09:27] institution [ __ ] capitalism be
[09:29] socialistic everyone has to have equal
[09:31] rights uh
[09:33] equality and I think that's the problem
[09:36] that Bitcoin is nowadays
[09:38] um because of the system sorry I'm I'm
[09:41] I'm I'm talk I'm making like a whole
[09:43] thing now but uh because of the system
[09:46] that we are now in it wasn't the same
[09:48] like it used to be from 10 years ago and
[09:50] I think that's the reason why we have
[09:52] socialism in the Bitcoin space right now
[09:53] because the system is so riged the
[09:55] system is
[09:56] so communistic that and capitalistic
[10:00] that people think are socialism
[10:01] socialism is a way out of that and they
[10:03] also use this false miscon uh
[10:06] misconception of equality and everyone
[10:08] gets equal rights equal money and that
[10:10] no that's not true cuz yeah Bitcoin is
[10:12] for anyone but is it truly for everyone
[10:14] is it for a let's say 85 year old who
[10:18] hasn't been great with technology all
[10:20] his life who still knows the old ways
[10:22] the uh I would argue the better ways you
[10:25] know planting your own food uh being
[10:28] decentralized you you know stuff like
[10:29] that so um sorry I'm I'm I'm making like
[10:32] a huge thing out of this but um I I
[10:34] think it's important to to talk about
[10:36] that because socialism is not great you
[10:38] can ask I mean I asked tons of people in
[10:40] prog how was for you how was it for you
[10:43] to live in a socialistic communistic
[10:44] regime and they said no it's [ __ ] it
[10:46] didn't work capitalistic was capitalism
[10:48] was the only way out of out of that so
[10:50] um why is that like uh and I I agree
[10:53] with you first of all uh but but why and
[10:57] first of all I'm I'm really impressed I
[10:58] feel like everyone under 20 uh
[11:02] especially in that age under 20 has a
[11:04] hard time grasping capitalism I think
[11:07] like capitalism is something that
[11:09] usually comes a little later in life
[11:11] where you grasp it uh and usually people
[11:14] between like 15 and 20 I mean between 15
[11:16] and 20 is a huge jump but they usually
[11:20] uh tend more towards socialism and more
[11:22] towards those ideals and then all of the
[11:25] sudden they have to make their own money
[11:27] and have to grow up and actually live in
[11:29] the D and they like oh yeah it's it
[11:31] makes sense that we have a free market
[11:34] social capitalist system so why does it
[11:38] make sense for you it just makes sense
[11:40] for me because um look at all look at
[11:43] history all socialistic and communistic
[11:46] regimes and dictatorship Stalin ma North
[11:48] Korea
[11:50] Venezuela it's [ __ ] it doesn't work
[11:52] I mean look how how rck the system is
[11:54] look
[11:55] how how should I call it uh poor the
[11:58] people are in those in those countries I
[11:59] mean North Korea it's like the I mean
[12:01] they have like the cheapest Subway which
[12:03] is like crazy when you think of it that
[12:05] that actually Subway is cheap and in
[12:08] Vienna it's like it's like not cheap or
[12:10] in in the UK it's also not cheap so uh
[12:14] but that's why I think I mean the fact
[12:18] is communism has never worked CU when
[12:20] you look at communism and socialism um
[12:23] they always so car marks basically the
[12:25] idea of Communism and socialism came
[12:27] from capitalism and people don't like
[12:29] that when I say that or generally people
[12:30] don't like that when you say that but um
[12:33] he took the bad things of capitalism or
[12:36] bad things and made them into socialism
[12:38] communism which is a abstract idea
[12:42] because what is so bad about capitalism
[12:44] what is so bad about the free market
[12:46] there's nothing bad about the free
[12:47] market just the ones who work hard who
[12:51] who do what they do they they get that
[12:53] they get rich at the end of the day and
[12:55] those who are lazy and don't want to
[12:56] work they don't get rich at the end of
[12:57] the day and I think that's why we have
[12:59] socialism that we have because we have
[13:01] lazy people who think it's unfair that
[13:03] some people are rich and some people are
[13:05] poor which I get it it's not nice that
[13:07] we have poor people in this world
[13:10] but maybe you also have to look at why
[13:12] we have poor people at this world I mean
[13:14] we have a system like the state which
[13:16] finances Wars prints money to finance
[13:19] Wars I mean the US for example they they
[13:21] have been involved in a war for like
[13:23] over decades now Afghanistan Syria Yemen
[13:27] Libya uh certain countries in Africa I
[13:29] mean uh what else should I call it
[13:31] Vietnam was like the biggest flop for
[13:33] the US government especially after they
[13:35] got rid of the gold standers in 1971 so
[13:40] um I think that's that's the main reason
[13:43] that people are too lazy and that
[13:45] capitalism for them is like a enemy
[13:48] because they don't want to because they
[13:49] want to make money out of laziness which
[13:51] doesn't works I saw that most people
[13:54] that are afraid of capitalism and are on
[13:57] the Socialist side they usually are
[13:59] afraid of taking responsibilities yes
[14:01] they usually are people who blame things
[14:04] on other people and not on themselves
[14:06] because I truly think when once you
[14:08] start U putting yourself uh in in the
[14:11] responsibility seat and you are like I'm
[14:13] responsible for things then you are more
[14:16] capitalistic in itself like you have to
[14:18] all of the sudden uh look out for for
[14:21] all the consequences and you have to be
[14:23] the better person so that's uh one one
[14:26] major thing for for me and it's it's
[14:29] also one reason why it usually comes
[14:31] later in in in life and for me it also
[14:34] came like I think around like 18 19
[14:36] actually when I made that shift and like
[14:38] oh actually yeah socialism does not
[14:40] really make sense for me I mean also the
[14:42] perfect example is with the green party
[14:44] the um they the most socialistic uh
[14:48] parties I oh party I actually know I
[14:50] mean we always talk about fire uh far
[14:52] right extremism or or uh I mean in
[14:55] Austria it's the FP that they always
[14:56] claim it's like far right I'm like is it
[14:58] truly far right or is there also far
[15:00] left wied parties I mean socialism and
[15:03] communism is far left and we never talk
[15:05] about those because we always say oh
[15:07] it's good but uh nationalism is bad or
[15:10] being a populistic guy who loves his
[15:12] country and wants the best for his
[15:14] country is like a bad thing and that's
[15:16] like the Spectrum and the double
[15:17] standard that I see in sometimes also in
[15:19] the Bitcoin space that we have people
[15:21] like Sager who are capitalistic who off
[15:24] their country or just I mean Trump is
[15:26] the best example I'm just U Mr orange
[15:28] guy as I always call him um Mr orange
[15:31] guy Trump who is capitalistic who is who
[15:33] loves his country then we have oh then
[15:35] we have socialism and um communism and
[15:38] those people are the lazy ones which
[15:40] don't like Trump or don't like
[15:41] capitalism because they think it's
[15:42] unfair that he's Rich right and that's
[15:45] the thing socialism communism always
[15:48] take examples of capitalism make them
[15:50] worse or think they make them good but
[15:53] and actually it's it's like it's like
[15:54] worse it's like it's like horrible and
[15:56] they even take profit from capitalism I
[15:58] mean look at Vienna Vienna is like like
[16:01] the city is like really socialistic and
[16:04] and we have like so many leftwing
[16:05] parties
[16:07] here that that say like oh yeah we have
[16:10] to be left we have to be good we have to
[16:12] be not right but then they take cap
[16:14] capitalism and rightwing ideas to to
[16:16] fuel their politics to fuel their
[16:19] ideology to to even fuel themselves I
[16:21] mean if in socialism what you going to
[16:23] live of I mean you of course you're
[16:26] going to use capitalistic ideas and
[16:28] ideologies to to make money to make a
[16:30] living so uh that's that those Tye of
[16:32] standards and I sometimes see those in
[16:34] the Bitcoin space as well so sorry I'm
[16:36] I'm I'm talking I'm not I'm like I'm
[16:38] talking like a whole thing here but it's
[16:39] it's what I love so um I I I love it a
[16:42] lot what you're talking about and it's
[16:44] it's refreshing to hear it like you
[16:46] really unfiltered and you're just going
[16:48] straight so uh but
[16:51] yeah look what else can you do it's h
[16:55] the world is crazy it's not what it used
[16:57] to be like 50 years ago would say but um
[17:01] there's how I mean maybe also technology
[17:04] is a problem nowadays cuz we have too
[17:06] much technology we have too much
[17:08] uh uh phones computers TVs I mean I I
[17:13] remember as um my grandpa told me that
[17:16] once when the first TVs came out you
[17:19] didn't said you didn't I mean the first
[17:21] thing that they did when they TV came
[17:23] out every day 7:00 in the morning TV on
[17:26] watch the news right and what what's the
[17:29] news financed by by the government by by
[17:32] those parties by I mean best example is
[17:34] CNN is financed by the Democrats right
[17:36] so uh or Fox News is financed by the
[17:38] Republicans right and then they they
[17:40] those news are going to push their
[17:42] ideology and and we have more left
[17:44] winged uh um mainstream Medias right so
[17:48] there're not really far a lot of farri
[17:50] rnged uh uh media Outlets but they're
[17:53] more leftwing but uh and I think that's
[17:55] also a problem that we have too much
[17:57] technology nowadays I mean I have phone
[17:59] I mean you have a phone as well right so
[18:01] you even have two with you yeah have two
[18:03] one is my finance phone one is my like
[18:05] my social media phone so I'm kind of
[18:07] kind of separating it but um but I stop
[18:10] uh being on on I mean I'm Twitter I use
[18:13] Twitter I use YouTube I use social media
[18:16] right but I I also stopped it and
[18:17] reduced it for U because sometimes just
[18:20] [ __ ] and propaganda right so um but
[18:23] I feel like with social media it uh it
[18:26] it it's a hard topic because like before
[18:28] before social media uh it was just like
[18:31] a local newspaper and it was even easier
[18:33] to manipulate uh now you have a lot of
[18:38] uncensored kind of sources like we have
[18:40] Rumble and nostro uh that are really I
[18:44] think kind of the gold standard of
[18:45] uncensoring but then there's also
[18:47] mainstream uh like ax it's it's not
[18:50] perfect but it's like really close to
[18:52] being uncensored it does still sensoring
[18:54] going on uh there's still algorithm but
[18:56] it's it's it's way better than other
[18:58] platforms then there's like YouTube
[19:00] there's podcast platforms there your own
[19:02] websites which is also an interesting
[19:04] topic then Facebook I feel like it's
[19:06] it's the worst worst of Tik Tok is is
[19:09] definitely also not good it's a mind
[19:11] viruses I think uh but uh I feel like in
[19:15] a sense it's also a free market like you
[19:17] can definitely also get yourself a
[19:19] YouTube feed that's really good yeah
[19:21] because when you search for the right
[19:23] accounts it just you have to put in the
[19:27] work yeah well yes
[19:29] I
[19:31] think I want to go back to um to freedom
[19:35] of speech because freedom of speech
[19:37] nowadays isn't what it used to be 50
[19:39] years ago because 50 years ago as you
[19:40] said there was no way to double check if
[19:42] it's true either was true or it wasn't
[19:45] and back then you would have been like a
[19:47] conspiracy theorist like with you know
[19:49] the aluminium head foil thing and
[19:51] nowadays it's not it's not it's not that
[19:53] anymore because we have so many sources
[19:55] we have Wikileaks with
[19:57] trange and
[20:00] I think his case especially proved how
[20:03] we can fight back against corruption
[20:05] against lies and um I mean Rumble is the
[20:08] best example I mean I upload all my
[20:10] podcast videos on on Rumble because I
[20:12] know that certain things on YouTube are
[20:14] censored like I I told you before the
[20:16] episode how they even um I mean my
[20:19] number one end question always was how
[20:22] what how are you fting Christine lard or
[20:25] and then everyone was like oh yeah that
[20:26] [ __ ] or [ __ ] it and then YouTube One
[20:29] Day wrote me I can't I can't ask that
[20:31] anymore it's too it's too political it's
[20:34] not nice I'm like oh well there you go
[20:35] that's why I'm uploading on Rumble right
[20:37] and and nowadays we have that so um
[20:40] that's one positive side of having
[20:41] technology that you always have multiple
[20:44] opportunities but it's still technology
[20:47] they they they they track you
[20:49] they it's not decentralized you know
[20:51] it's it's if if I would have a
[20:53] decentralized system or my own server or
[20:56] my own laptop or computer because
[20:58] certain people know how to do that stuff
[21:00] then it's something else but if you have
[21:02] like a Macbook which is own by a company
[21:04] right which is which has its own service
[21:06] Software System and all that stuff on it
[21:09] and you use that it's more of a tracking
[21:11] tool than um I mean my phone is also my
[21:13] tracking tool right but you know what I
[21:16] mean it's
[21:18] it's it's just like you have that thing
[21:21] which tracks you and then then you have
[21:23] that thing which doesn't track you and
[21:24] then you're like in the middle and you
[21:26] use both of them so it's it's
[21:29] it's a little bit like a when when you
[21:31] talk to people about that they think
[21:33] you're n like you're a crazy guy or like
[21:36] or like okay yeah which Rabbit Hole did
[21:38] you go down I'm like well it's a fact
[21:40] the NSA and CIA buies on us every day
[21:42] and things that we say on the internet
[21:44] they you can't get rid of those anymore
[21:46] I mean if if I would say uh I think uh I
[21:50] don't know Michael sers is uh not nice
[21:53] it will be on the internet for forever
[21:55] or or if I would say Donald Trump is a
[21:58] great guy will be on the internet
[21:59] forever and people will charge you based
[22:01] on that so um it's a little bit it's a
[22:03] hard topic when we when we talk about
[22:05] the internet because it has changed like
[22:07] so much in past 30 years I would say so
[22:12] do do you think that uh it is about to
[22:15] get better or is it not getting better
[22:18] like the internet free speech uh we have
[22:20] some some like ill mask and X for me was
[22:23] a step in the right
[22:26] direction I think yes and no because es
[22:30] in Europe no in the US and I would argue
[22:34] the UK maybe also because UK for me UK
[22:36] was never part of Europe although they
[22:38] were in the Europe in the European Union
[22:40] once but um UK is more like
[22:42] International because Europe is like a
[22:44] thing of his own and you know including
[22:46] all the the EAS countries like Russia
[22:49] Poland Ukraine and all those there I
[22:51] think no because especially with stuff
[22:54] like amla or with their lost digital IDs
[22:56] or I mean I mean El musk even said
[22:58] himself the other day on Twitter that do
[23:00] you try
[23:01] to um centor him by making a deal which
[23:05] Instagram Facebook and all those
[23:06] companies have made with the U which
[23:09] when you say something against the you
[23:10] against politicians they delete your
[23:13] account and they probably arrest you or
[23:15] or send you like a notice from the
[23:17] police that hey you can't say that again
[23:19] right and and musk doesn't do that
[23:20] because he's International so I would
[23:22] say him and Twitter it's like a yes it's
[23:26] heading in a good direction but on the
[23:28] International System not on the European
[23:31] system because Europe they they want to
[23:33] keep us mod they want to destroy its own
[23:35] people for some reason they they don't
[23:37] like their own people so um it's kind of
[23:40] it's kind of Europe no but the
[23:42] international level yes so uh
[23:44] it's it's sad but it's the truth you
[23:47] know so um Europe is not the thing that
[23:49] it used to be like 20 years ago so so we
[23:52] should get out of the of the European
[23:54] Union yeah definitely I mean with amra
[23:55] especially the finance police which by
[23:57] the way if you if you own 3K a month
[23:59] let's say like that and you buy a bag
[24:02] for 4K they're going to call you and
[24:03] check your transaction and and going to
[24:05] say Hey you bought a p for 4K how can
[24:07] you own a p for 4K when you only make 3K
[24:10] for a living right where did that extra
[24:12] K came from and that's how far we have
[24:14] gone in the EU that we point fingers at
[24:18] countries like China North Korea Russia
[24:19] for being dictatorships right but then
[24:21] we do the same tactics like they do or
[24:24] we did this or we we use the same
[24:25] tactics like uh certain people didn't in
[24:27] were in Germany so uh I'm not going to
[24:30] say his name because I don't want to I
[24:32] don't want you to get in trouble but
[24:34] um yeah it's just it's use just a for me
[24:38] you heading into a digital communistic
[24:41] regime AKA CBC AKA social credit system
[24:44] so it's hard but
[24:47] um once you understand it and once you
[24:50] go deep down the rabbit hole uh it's
[24:52] like no way back so uh I mean I left
[24:54] Europe a few years ago three four years
[24:56] ago because it was just enough
[24:57] especially with Co
[24:58] and uh the vaccines and all that [ __ ] so
[25:02] um so I would say Europe Europe is a
[25:05] thinking ship currently and uh countries
[25:08] that join the EU um they're on the verge
[25:11] of uh getting uh bankrupt I mean look at
[25:14] Germany for example Germany's Germany is
[25:16] like a it's going bankrupt in my opinion
[25:19] and it already is if you watch or listen
[25:21] to my podcast on a regular basis I guess
[25:24] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[25:26] the most important step is to keep the
[25:29] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[25:32] wallet my personal recommendation for
[25:34] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[25:37] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[25:39] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[25:41] their Bitcoin on an exchange and you can

[25:54] really want to bulletproof your self

[25:59] even your citizenship setup you have to

[26:05] Bitcoin way.com

[26:11] free call where you can dive deep with
[26:14] them if your self custody setup is

[26:22] digital footprint in general is secure
[26:26] they are the experts in C Security in
[26:29] Bitcoin self custody and how to be a
[26:32] secure sovereign individual in general
[26:35] how bad was the Germany sold the Bitcoin
[26:38] and now a few weeks later it's very
[26:42] clear that the US is not selling their
[26:44] Bitcoin at
[26:45] all rather they are buying probably more
[26:49] yeah and uh I
[26:50] mean Germany itself is like stupid you
[26:54] know they they have stupid I mean the
[26:55] thing with 12 months owning crypto or
[26:57] Bitcoin and then if you if you own them
[26:59] 12 months you can sell them or keep them
[27:01] like like imagine that rule it's it's
[27:03] your money and the state tells you what
[27:06] to do with your money like that's why I
[27:08] say Germany and are falling thinking
[27:10] ship because they have so many laws so
[27:13] many stupid things they they want to tax
[27:16] you on I mean Germany has like 80 taxes
[27:18] like I mean I have friends calling me
[27:20] hey dude look at that I mean look on
[27:23] your bills um I'm not sure how it is in
[27:25] Austria but look on your bills the like
[27:27] the a few days um a few days ago I
[27:29] looked on a pill like tax on this on
[27:32] this and this and this and I'm like why
[27:34] do we need all those taxes like where's
[27:36] that money even going to it's go to it
[27:38] goes to the state it's not even going to
[27:39] the company it goes to the state right
[27:41] so um I would say the you and the loss
[27:45] with taxes and it's just it's just too
[27:47] much for people and I think people are
[27:49] getting annoyed by that as well do taxes
[27:52] in general makees sense or is every tax
[27:54] even a small one uh unnecessary look I'm
[27:58] not against taxes because historically
[28:00] taxes have been invented for a greater
[28:03] good to to to found a community I mean
[28:05] if I pay a tax into a community or into
[28:07] a um it's say uh in into a state like
[28:11] like say I live in Texas and I play and
[28:13] I pay like taxes for the State of Texas
[28:15] right then it's fine for me because I I
[28:18] pay the taxes for the State of Texas
[28:21] which is a community which everyone
[28:22] takes care of right but if I pay like
[28:25] not just that tax if I also pay income
[28:27] tax
[28:28] tax on my uh source of flavoring tax on
[28:31] uh on what I own you know there's where
[28:34] I think there's there there that's too
[28:37] much right that's like like sorry I mean
[28:40] why should I pay income tax why should
[28:42] pay why should I generally pay taxes if
[28:44] they just print money out of f air right
[28:46] so um I would say if I pay taxes for for
[28:50] um the community or like a account then
[28:52] it's fine for me but if I have to pay
[28:54] tax on like to the state which then uses
[28:57] that money to send weapons to Ukraine
[28:59] for example then for me it makes no
[29:01] sense at all then it's just a scam and
[29:03] especially the climate change scam you
[29:05] know how they since 50 years they told
[29:08] us uh all the com is going to rise the
[29:11] sea level is going to rise but the
[29:13] Statue of Liberty in New York is is it's
[29:16] still not underwater right so still
[29:18] above water sea levels haven't rised for
[29:20] like a decade I mean if sea sea levels
[29:22] would rise half of California would be
[29:24] gone and I know that Banks like J Morgan
[29:28] they would also have like insurances for
[29:30] that which I don't like all the central
[29:32] banks don't have insurance for that I
[29:33] mean we we even had um that we think the
[29:37] co of blackw work saying that climate
[29:39] change is like a scam like I saw an
[29:40] interview the other day where he said
[29:41] it's a scam it we don't have insurance
[29:43] with that because it's never going to
[29:44] happen right so um and it resulted in
[29:47] one more thing taxes over 50 years they
[29:50] have been saying that and look how more
[29:52] taxes we got look how uh more laws we
[29:55] have I mean they even in certain States
[29:58] in the US you have to have like a
[30:00] electric vehicle AKA Tesla otherwise uh
[30:03] the state of California comes to you and
[30:05] says oh if you don't buy a Tesla now
[30:07] we're going to take away your car like
[30:08] like where are we are we in a
[30:10] communistic socialistic regime or are we
[30:13] in a western word which has democracy
[30:15] and I'm doing that because we don't have
[30:17] democracy it's a it's a false ideology
[30:19] so um but
[30:22] yeah is Bitcoin here to uh save us
[30:26] yes uh just what I'm not going to say I
[30:29] just say yes so because I talk too much
[30:32] so but yes it's here to save us and here
[30:34] to stay I love it so much um and we
[30:37] already have a lot of Bitcoin history we
[30:39] have a lot of like 15 years and it's
[30:41] already a lot of things happened we all
[30:43] kind of have all the buckets that we
[30:45] need like the countries that are in the
[30:47] nation levels that are in institutions
[30:49] that are in um where do you think
[30:52] Bitcoin is going in the next 20 years do
[30:54] we see a global Bitcoin standard in in
[30:57] 20 years I mean you're now almost 20 so
[31:01] when you're like 40 which is like middle
[31:03] of the life like 50 is not the middle of
[31:05] the life for right now like 40 is is
[31:07] kind of the middle of the life do you
[31:08] see yourself living on a Bitcoin
[31:11] standard um yes but the only problem is
[31:15] I'm going to expand on that that we
[31:17] still live in a fat world and I'm not
[31:19] I'm not mad at someone who changes his
[31:21] Bitcoin for Fiat because we live in a
[31:22] Fiat standard we have to make a living
[31:24] we have to pay rent right we have to pay
[31:26] taxes of Al scam we have to pay certain
[31:29] bills so um but I think in 20 years
[31:32] especially now with what Trump announced
[31:34] that he's going to use it as a
[31:36] reserve if he does that and I think he
[31:40] will because Trump has always when he
[31:41] said something that he will do he always
[31:43] did it um I think when it comes to that
[31:45] he's always a good guy in a sense
[31:48] because he he does what he says um I
[31:51] think if P if Bitcoin continues its path
[31:54] like that and if we have countries like
[31:56] El Salvador the US taking it as a
[31:59] reserve um using it as a reserve sorry
[32:02] uh then it will rise and it will
[32:04] continue to rise maybe they will be some
[32:06] years where it falls down again because
[32:07] people will sell it people will buy some
[32:10] more right uh but um I think it will
[32:13] rise it will maybe go to 150k who knows
[32:16] 250k especially when countries like the
[32:19] US uses it as a uh reserve and prints
[32:22] money to buy Bitcoin maybe then they
[32:24] will get higher I don't know but um I
[32:27] think here to stay and I think it will
[32:29] have a big impact on our lives might not
[32:32] replace the dollar because the dollar is
[32:33] like a huge thing and which by the way
[32:36] the Americans Push by their Wars in in
[32:38] the Middle East in around the world
[32:40] that's that's typical American they go
[32:41] to countries they push their agenda they
[32:43] dollar and then if they don't accept it
[32:45] they they finance Wars but um and and
[32:48] start wars I mean we have seen it in
[32:50] Iraq for example um but yeah uh that's a
[32:53] different topic but yeah I think it's
[32:54] going to rise and continue it's its way
[32:57] of grow and making our lives easier and
[32:59] better but you don't think that the Fiat
[33:03] system will be it will always be there
[33:06] when you are here on the world um maybe
[33:09] in 200 years it will be gone but people
[33:11] in the Bitcoin space especially think
[33:13] that in 20 years there will be no Fiat
[33:15] money anymore which is [ __ ] it will
[33:18] always be there I mean at the moment
[33:20] there's no Fiat money families like the
[33:22] Rockefellers uh vanguards uh Rell all of
[33:26] those families will be bankrupt and
[33:27] basically also the whole world because
[33:29] if they go bankrupt the whole world is
[33:30] go is going bankrupt and maybe that
[33:34] isn't a bad thing because then we have
[33:35] Bitcoin as alternative right but um I
[33:38] think 200 years maybe we Bitcoin will be
[33:41] bigger than Fiat but right now like in
[33:42] 20 years 60 years maybe no because Fiat
[33:46] is just oh sorry Fiat is a everyday
[33:48] thing nowadays and we still have jobs we
[33:50] still have to make a living right I mean
[33:52] there are people in the Bitcoin space
[33:54] which pay the um their employees with
[33:57] Fiat right
[33:58] which buy Bitcoin every month sell those
[34:01] Bitcoin for Fiat and then pay their
[34:02] employees in Fiat right and that's not
[34:05] going to replace uh I I think bitcoin's
[34:07] not going to replace Fiat soon but maybe
[34:10] in 200 years maybe once we we maybe I'm
[34:14] I'm I'm going to be dead by now so how
[34:16] should I know but um I think not soon
[34:20] but sooner or later it's going to be
[34:22] bigger than Fiat and replace Fiat
[34:25] amazing uh one question that I have in
[34:27] my mind a lot of the times when I I go
[34:29] with with Bitcoin podcasts uh especially
[34:32] when we talk about Bitcoin and freedom
[34:34] uh there's always this concept of having
[34:36] freedom and there's different kinds of
[34:38] freedoms like there's time Freedom
[34:39] there's Financial Freedom there's
[34:41] different concept of Freedom
[34:43] um H how do you define freedom for
[34:46] yourself and would you say you are free
[34:50] yes um for me freedom is if I don't have
[34:53] to do what do what people tell me
[34:55] because I don't like that I I never
[34:57] liked it when people told me what to do
[34:58] especially during the pandemic people
[35:00] told me to wear a mask I didn't wear a
[35:01] mask I was not vaccinated so I'm I'm
[35:03] going to be open about this because
[35:05] that's why am right so
[35:07] um I think
[35:10] that I think I'm free because I can do
[35:13] whatever the [ __ ] I can do whatever the
[35:15] [ __ ] I want because of Bitcoin so I can
[35:16] even swear I I I I guess I couldn't do
[35:19] that in the old system because people
[35:21] like oh don't swear it's so rude I'm
[35:22] like no it's not rude it's a it's a word
[35:24] it's like uh it's like [ __ ] is a word
[35:26] it's it's nothing bad to say [ __ ] right
[35:28] so
[35:29] um I I guess um I'm free and I have a
[35:34] certain amount of freedom because of
[35:36] Bitcoin and because um me and my family
[35:38] got off a system which is corrupt which
[35:41] as I said uses tax money to finance Wars
[35:43] sending weapons to Ukraine potentially
[35:46] starting a nuclear war AK World War I
[35:49] for some reason at all because they have
[35:50] money in Ukraine or or I don't know
[35:52] what's going on there but uh I would say
[35:55] certain amount of freedom is there
[35:56] because of Bitcoin and I am free because
[35:58] of Bitcoin what steps are you taking to
[36:01] protect this
[36:04] freedom I guess if I want to be honest
[36:08] um my way to protect my freedom is to be
[36:12] decentralized yes I have a phone yes the
[36:14] government can track me but I would
[36:17] argue if you have your own server if you
[36:19] have your own uh note running that's the
[36:23] best way to protect your freedom and if
[36:24] you also plant your own food because now
[36:27] days we are being poisoned with the
[36:29] supermarked food which they claim to
[36:32] be biion neutral carbon neutrum like
[36:35] since when does an apple have to be
[36:36] carbon neutral or or has to be I mean
[36:38] it's an apple you eat it it's it's
[36:40] delicious it's uh it's sweet it's nice
[36:43] and I grew up in a way that I always
[36:46] planted my own food I grew my own food I
[36:48] grew my potatoes I grew my strawberries
[36:50] my onions my tomatoes uh Tomatoes sorry
[36:53] I have to I have to say Tomatoes I can't
[36:55] say the I can't I can't say say it in
[36:58] the American way I grow my own Tomatoes
[37:01] strawberries um I think that's a way to
[37:04] protect your freedom being decentralized
[37:06] being not REI reliable on a system which
[37:10] uh poison us with with food and uh and
[37:14] with stuff that's not good for our
[37:15] bodies so um and our minds also as well
[37:19] so so what are you currently doing uh
[37:22] you're probably in school University or
[37:24] is out um I finished school
[37:29] um it's funny I when I grew up I always
[37:32] wanted to be like a lawyer or doctor or
[37:34] like a like a lobbyist or politician but
[37:36] nowaday I'm like no I'm not going to do
[37:38] that anymore it's like it's like those
[37:40] areas like the most corrupt areas areas
[37:42] in the system where where people get
[37:44] paid like daily I mean the UK government
[37:47] especially like the the the parliament
[37:49] is like one of the most corrupt corrupt
[37:51] corrupted corrupt most corrupted there
[37:54] is in the world sorry um so I always
[37:57] like politician but nowadays I'm like no
[38:00] no politician no no lawyer no lobbyist
[38:02] no doctor nothing um so yeah I finished
[38:05] school and I'm free I can do whatever I
[38:08] want so uh currently I have a podcast
[38:10] called Nora podcast together with my mom
[38:12] and we have an English show and German
[38:13] show so um I'm more focused on that but
[38:17] currently I'm also working on my own
[38:18] fashion brand which I will try to
[38:21] implement Bitcoin as a payment system
[38:23] and I'm currently working on the
[38:25] websites and all that stuff so it's
[38:26] still and the clo as well this design
[38:29] and that's like my hobby and what I love
[38:32] um so yeah but um not in school not in
[38:34] University not in a system which uh
[38:37] pressurizes its people and tells them
[38:39] what to do so I'm free I'm I'm a nomad I
[38:41] can travel wherever I want to and I have
[38:43] the benefit because I'm half Swiss half
[38:45] Austrian I have both passports right so
[38:48] I'm not restricted to traveling to
[38:49] certain countries so I can just travel
[38:51] and that's cool so you have swiss
[38:55] Austria you have B UK uh was what's your
[38:59] favorite or any other countries in there
[39:01] um UK is my favorite because UK is like
[39:03] it's like the for me the UK especially
[39:05] London is like the coolest City there is
[39:08] um people in the UK are open-minded for
[39:11] me the UK is the is the everyone always
[39:14] says Ah the UK its Financial Market is
[39:17] like not big I'm like no it's it's like
[39:19] I mean city of flon runs the UK and TI
[39:22] ofon tells the the the PM the the banks
[39:25] what to do and I feel safe if when I'm
[39:28] whenever I'm there because it's it's
[39:30] a stable they have a stable or stable
[39:33] economy I mean I'm not sure if everyone
[39:35] has a stable economy nowadays but
[39:37] uh I prefer the UK from then I would
[39:40] argue Vienna and Austria because um you
[39:44] austrians are always you're always so
[39:45] loving and caring and for me it's home
[39:47] because I have roots from austri so but
[39:49] Switzerland H Switzerland is like I I
[39:51] stop with uh being friends with
[39:53] Switzerland I oh free no
[39:58] it's always funny when I talk about this
[39:59] because I I say it a lot but Switzerland
[40:02] is always in the middle you have good
[40:05] guys and you have the bad guys and
[40:06] Switzerland is always switching in
[40:07] between um they did it with the with
[40:10] with a German guy in World War II they
[40:12] financed him they gave him weapons and
[40:14] then suddenly they were like anti-s when
[40:16] the US came in and freed everyone in
[40:18] World War II so um twitz land always
[40:20] financed the the terrorism in this world
[40:23] and then also the good guys you know so
[40:25] uh that's why I left switzland that's
[40:27] why I'm I'm done with switzland uh maybe
[40:29] I will go back one or two times to visit
[40:31] friends or my grandparents but
[40:34] um switzland is not neutral let me tell
[40:37] you that they always claim they are but
[40:38] they're not they always financed both
[40:40] sides of Wars so um it's also
[40:42] interesting I didn't think about it but
[40:44] UK like left the U do you think it was a
[40:47] really good step yes because uh the U
[40:50] just when the UK was in the EU they had
[40:52] so many restrictions they had so much uh
[40:55] wrong going on and and now that they're
[40:58] out of the UK yes brexit was Bloody it
[41:00] was messy but it was the best step to
[41:03] get out of the U because look at the you
[41:05] now it's a falling sing ship right
[41:08] everything in the U goes like that
[41:10] everything in the U that you touch is
[41:12] not it's not good anymore but when you
[41:14] touch something on International level
[41:16] or in the UK there you go it's much more
[41:19] Freer and people always think are you
[41:21] but the UK rainy uh um are not so nice
[41:25] you know British food is [ __ ] said
[41:27] I'm like have you been to UK have you
[41:29] seen their numbers have you seen how
[41:31] life is better than ever before before
[41:33] they were in the U it was like not good
[41:35] it was like uh I mean I don't even need
[41:39] to talk about this like in more detail
[41:40] but it's just I see it with my eyes
[41:43] every day it's better for for certain
[41:45] people especially For the Working Class
[41:46] People cuz before they were in the U was
[41:49] like horrible for them the the just also
[41:52] taxwise it was horrible for them but now
[41:54] but now it's better I'm not sure how it
[41:56] is with star now and with labor taking
[41:58] over because I'm not a big fan of labor
[42:00] but they're my opinion I mean we they
[42:03] replaced one WF puppet with the another
[42:06] I mean riak and and uh kir starm are
[42:09] both uh in the world economic forum and
[42:12] both controlled by Co Rob but um that's
[42:14] a different story so uh but yeah it's
[42:16] it's much more better nowadays
[42:18] especially because of city of London
[42:19] said so because city of London back then
[42:21] and [ __ ] farash um they they were the
[42:24] ones pushing for brexit because
[42:25] especially the the compan in the UK that
[42:29] are there there's a reason why they are
[42:30] there because of the taxes they can
[42:32] avoid because of the all these laws that
[42:34] you has implemented and it's like it's
[42:37] like a a I would I would say um the UK
[42:41] is a way to get around of taxes you know
[42:43] especially in the EU I mean many many
[42:46] companies that are based in the EU are
[42:47] now moving towards the UK because of the
[42:50] taxes because of the laws because of
[42:52] amra the finance police uh so sorry for
[42:55] for talking so much but
[42:57] it's a it's an important thing to know
[43:00] why yeah it's really interesting also if
[43:02] if UK uh I mean there's also a a great
[43:05] thing like Swiss is for me like the
[43:07] Austria that is outside of the EU but
[43:10] you're also saying it you don't like
[43:11] Swiss that much and you like UK more
[43:13] yeah because the the Switzerland has
[43:15] always been
[43:17] um a black sheep although they're not in
[43:19] the U they have laws with the youu they
[43:22] have uh contracts with the you they I
[43:25] mean also the thing with where the
[43:27] finance police thing they they're part
[43:30] of this because they are in the EA State
[43:32] I think you call it so um Switzerland
[43:35] has always been on both sides no matter
[43:37] what left and right or middle up and
[43:39] down they have always been either good
[43:41] or bad or find at both of them so
[43:44] uh it's that's why I left it because
[43:47] it's it's not the what they always claim
[43:49] it to be did they try to be uh The Best
[43:52] of Both Worlds or it might be the the
[43:55] the the worst of Both Worlds I don't
[43:57] know Switzerland is an interesting topic
[43:58] for me but yeah let's uh it's
[44:02] not because I also now think more and
[44:05] more about like oh where I actually want
[44:07] to live because my life could be movable
[44:11] like I have work that's movable I have a
[44:14] girlfriend that's open to move uh yeah
[44:17] of course I want to visit all the time a
[44:19] family but I don't have to be 12 months
[44:21] here I can be two months here I can be
[44:23] three months here no matter is a big
[44:25] thing and you live up in the family that
[44:28] was normal or did your family while you
[44:30] were born already decided to be nor so
[44:33] we left in Switzerland until 20 2020
[44:37] yeah 2021 so 3 four years ago no wait 20
[44:40] yeah 2021 and then there was the point
[44:43] especially during the pandemic where we
[44:45] decided so enough is enough we're going
[44:46] to travel we're not going to be in a
[44:49] system any longer that doesn't like us
[44:51] that poison us uh that sells us a
[44:53] solution and creates a problem at the
[44:55] same time right um um that's what they
[44:57] did they created a problem that then
[44:59] sold us the solution uh without even
[45:01] thinking if it might harm people but um
[45:04] so yeah so we used to live in
[45:06] Switzerland it was it was lovely for me
[45:08] it was nice growing up there but
[45:11] essentially I I seen enough I had enough
[45:13] of the the neutral aspect
[45:16] um uh the the financing of terrorism on
[45:19] both sides and yeah so 20121 we decided
[45:21] to travel around the world being a being
[45:24] Nomads is it's it gives you more freedom
[45:26] it's hard because you don't have a
[45:28] garden where you can plant your own food
[45:29] or or stuff like that but I mean if I if
[45:32] I know where the farmer gets his food
[45:34] from or how he plants his food then I'm
[45:36] I'm I mean I never bought stuff in the
[45:38] supermarket I always go uh directly to
[45:40] the farmer because decentralized right
[45:43] buying stuff that's grown by itself or
[45:46] by someone not uh not in a a lap or in a
[45:49] I don't know Bill Gates Farm which
[45:51] uh I'm not sure what it does to those
[45:54] stuffs there but um but yeah that was
[45:57] 2021 was the was the year where we
[45:59] decided to with a nomadic lifestyle so
[46:02] and now you are all around the world or
[46:04] is there like any countries where you're
[46:06] like oh I'm for a few months here a few
[46:08] months there like how does it work I'm a
[46:10] lot in the UK because um because it's
[46:13] for me I love the UK so sometimes a lot
[46:14] of there but most of the times I'm also
[46:16] here in Austria then a lot a lot in
[46:19] Spain and the cool thing with the UK is
[46:22] you can stay up to 6 months but if
[46:24] you're over 6 months you have to uh
[46:26] register you have to pay tax right in
[46:29] austa no is it not is it six months is
[46:31] it not three months because of the EU oh
[46:34] it's interesting uh I thought I mean I
[46:36] know that with taxes because I have been
[46:40] um in Austria and Germany last two years
[46:43] and both of the times I was more in
[46:46] Germany than in Austria uh and that's
[46:49] why I paid even taxes in Austria but got
[46:52] everything of the taxes back because it
[46:54] was only uh in in Germany that's why I
[46:57] say like half a year I don't know with
[46:59] registering because I just registered uh
[47:02] in the country we I lived in uh
[47:04] basically but there's like this this tax
[47:06] thing where when you are under half a
[47:08] year there uh you don't have to pay
[47:11] taxes uh so especially when there's like
[47:13] a a state like Germany where they have
[47:16] um um agreement with those stes where
[47:20] you only have to pay there okay yeah but
[47:23] you know that that's a cool thing you
[47:24] can only stay up to 3 months or 6 months
[47:26] and there you go you're back on the move
[47:28] again and I think if more people would
[47:31] do that I mean the state always says
[47:34] it's to avoid taxes and I don't see it
[47:36] that way yeah maybe I'm maybe I am
[47:39] avoiding taxes when I live a nomadic
[47:41] lify but I am free I can I can seek I
[47:45] learned so much through traveling and
[47:48] through talking to people because you
[47:50] experience culture and that's how we
[47:52] should do it you you should experience
[47:54] culture you should experience different
[47:55] views different opinions in different
[47:57] religions uh and I think that's the
[48:00] coolest thing about being a nomad um I
[48:03] can do whatever I want I can I can I can
[48:06] be here for a month and then go back to
[48:08] UK be there for five months and then go
[48:10] from there to the US be there for two
[48:12] months again I think I have to apply for
[48:14] a Visa though but uh that's a different
[48:16] story with the us
[48:18] but um I would definitely argue uh as
[48:22] long as you're under those six or 3
[48:24] months you're fine you don't have to pay
[48:26] any taxes but if you're above that then
[48:28] you're [ __ ] so so because I mean in
[48:31] Germany if you're above three months
[48:32] they really they they or if you even
[48:34] have a key to a apartment they're going
[48:37] to they're going to ask you oh you have
[48:38] a key for an apartment or you're longer
[48:40] here than 3 months you have to pay tax
[48:41] now you have to register then there you
[48:43] go then you then you're back in the
[48:45] system again so um it's like it's like a
[48:47] whole it's like a whole uh thing that's
[48:50] like [ __ ] is it three months in a row or
[48:53] is it three months in a calendar year I
[48:55] think it's three three months in a
[48:57] calendar year I feel like uh I think so
[48:59] was H I'm not sure actually I think so
[49:03] but I have friends which have been like
[49:08] two months in Germany and then went
[49:10] around the world like for a month and
[49:12] then came back and then those three
[49:14] months started again over yeah I like
[49:17] for all my viewers now I go right now
[49:20] down this Rabbit Hole MH okay uh and uh
[49:24] once I'm down there once I'm in informed
[49:27] about all the stuff like where can you
[49:30] uh live and how can you kind of Escape
[49:33] physically um how can I say it the the
[49:36] nation state uh um decentralization like
[49:40] if if you have Bitcoin you decentralized
[49:42] your own finances your own money but
[49:45] that's not enough like if you're still
[49:46] like completely in the system in in one
[49:48] country all the time they can still uh
[49:51] do a lot of things to you so like that's
[49:53] the next step for me being there also Al
[49:57] um let's say maybe a weird word for that
[50:01] but Untouchable like just being a free
[50:04] bird like I think who said it uh Fred
[50:06] Krug was on my podcast and he said like
[50:08] if a bird flies over a country border he
[50:12] doesn't pay taxes no he doesn't go to
[50:14] tall be that bird and exactly and the
[50:18] thing even with borders is why do we
[50:19] even have
[50:20] borders I mean I mean if I want to
[50:23] travel to a country why can't I just
[50:24] travel there I mean even even I I I hate
[50:27] it every time you know pass passport
[50:29] controls or TSA and all that [ __ ] when
[50:32] they when then you scan the password and
[50:34] then or you give them the pment then
[50:35] they look at you like you're some
[50:37] criminal because it's like like like I
[50:40] sorry why you I even ask one is there a
[50:42] I even ask one uh like a few years ago
[50:44] is there a I was like 16 around that so
[50:46] uh I I asked him is there a problem sir
[50:49] and he was like no no no no no problem
[50:50] at all it's like yeah why are you
[50:51] looking my passport what what what are
[50:53] you looking for in my passport just scan
[50:55] the damn passport and give it back to me
[50:56] say have a nice trip what's the problem
[50:58] I'm allowed to travel it's a free Road
[51:00] it's a free country right and he was so
[51:02] mad at me he turned red and looked at me
[51:04] oh oh okay okay here he let me you know
[51:06] but I I just feel like nowadays you you
[51:10] get treated like some sort of criminal
[51:12] if if you even travel or if you even
[51:14] want to go to a country and stay there
[51:16] for a few months um it's like TR try to
[51:20] go over the borders with more than like
[51:23] a th000 in cash or 10,000 in cash or
[51:25] like just a little bit of gold they will
[51:28] assume that you have stolen it and you
[51:30] want to smuggle it through the countries
[51:32] uh they don't even consider that it's
[51:35] your money they consider like oh no no
[51:37] you have stolen that money definitely uh
[51:40] and like that's why like if if you don't
[51:42] have your uh finances in Bitcoin like
[51:45] you are screwed yeah and uh how how can
[51:48] I mean they could
[51:50] potentially if you buy Bitcoin they
[51:52] could potentially lock in on me poool
[51:54] you know where you see the blockchain
[51:55] and all the transactions and
[51:57] probably see oh yeah that guy bought
[51:59] like 50 Bitcoin but how are they even
[52:02] going to know it I it was me that bought
[52:04] Bitcoin they're not going to know and
[52:07] with gold or with fiia they can double
[52:10] they can double check that right but
[52:11] with Bitcoin no and I think that's why I
[52:14] being a nomad and being a Bitcoin Nomad
[52:16] especially
[52:18] um it gives me sort of Freedom that the
[52:21] state can't take away and for me it's
[52:25] it's like the cool thing to be a big
[52:27] corner so so because there's no uh age
[52:32] Gap I mean you're 25 I'm 19 and we're
[52:34] here sitting and talking in your podcast
[52:36] and that's how it should be right that's
[52:37] not there shouldn't be a gap between
[52:41] U Generations there should be the
[52:44] highest generation like let's say a guy
[52:47] from Generation X teaching the
[52:49] Generation Y or said uh how life is
[52:51] supposed to go so uh that that's cool
[52:53] for me yeah that's really really cool I
[52:56] had also yes no no not yesterday last
[52:58] week on my oldest guest and now you're
[53:00] my youngest guest and and in between the
[53:03] two of you there are 56
[53:07] years uh between the the two 75 and 19
[53:11] so it's like a huge like even with me
[53:13] like there's 50 years in between he's
[53:15] three times older than me and for you
[53:17] it's a little bit more than three times
[53:19] older it's it's it's fascinating four
[53:20] times yeah oh wait no three three times
[53:24] no for me he's four times older right
[53:27] four times oh five times doesn't matter
[53:29] doesn't matter uh oh yeah it's it's five
[53:32] times maybe four yeah four times for
[53:34] them it's the math is always wrong yeah
[53:37] math is always wrong math is always
[53:39] wrong um all your models are wrong some
[53:42] are useful yeah but but that's how it
[53:44] should be it should be the older
[53:45] generation teaches the younger
[53:47] generation the younger generation
[53:48] teaches the older generation that's
[53:50] absolutely and you have that in Bitcoin
[53:52] you don't have that in a field world so
[53:53] um absolutely perfect then that's I
[53:56] think the best uh way to introduce our
[54:00] first outine uh what can we learn from
[54:03] you besides the things that we already
[54:05] talked about in the podcast what can we
[54:07] learn from you that even youngsters can
[54:10] be in the Bitcoin space and can be free
[54:12] I mean because my generation always
[54:14] thinks our life is so hard working is
[54:17] hard or how I mean I I I can tell you
[54:20] multiple times I was awake at night fing
[54:22] what I'm what what I'm going to do like
[54:24] how should I make money how should I
[54:25] make Liv should I pay tax bre and all
[54:27] that stuff which I don't or still don't
[54:30] know with
[54:31] 19 or actually starting to know a little
[54:34] bit but um I think what people can learn
[54:37] from younger people like me is that
[54:39] everything is possible even at a very
[54:41] young age I mean uh it's not just that
[54:44] you have to work and buy a house or or
[54:48] uh work in a country for 30 years and
[54:50] then you're free now you can even be
[54:52] free now and I mean I was in an online
[54:54] school so for me I always was capable
[54:57] capable of traveling and having school
[54:59] at the same time so uh I think one thing
[55:03] that should people take away from young
[55:05] people like me is everything is possible
[55:07] at a very young age so uh that's what I
[55:09] would say I I love that a lot really
[55:12] really cool perfect then let's get to
[55:15] our actual andrine I've written down the
[55:17] question from the previous guest like my
[55:18] Andro is uh the question from the
[55:20] previous guest asked you a question uh
[55:23] without even knowing you so the question
[55:26] from you from the previous guest is what
[55:28] is the most important educational value
[55:30] for you uh to be a sovereign individual
[55:34] educ oh oh gosh that's a good question
[55:37] um education and value to be Sovereign
[55:41] okay um I would
[55:44] say learning what it means to be
[55:47] decentralized that's for me the most
[55:49] important thing learning what it means
[55:51] to grow your grow your own food um I
[55:55] would even argue if you have to go
[55:57] hunting go fishing you know cuz cuz what
[55:59] did uh men do a thousand years ago when
[56:03] we still had like uh caveman and cave
[56:05] woman or they didn't have like a
[56:07] supermarket they went out themselves and
[56:09] did their own work proof of work don't
[56:11] trust verify so um I would say being
[56:13] decentralized and learning what it means
[56:16] learning what proof of work means and
[56:18] don't trust verify that's that's my
[56:21] that's what I would say amazing uh thank
