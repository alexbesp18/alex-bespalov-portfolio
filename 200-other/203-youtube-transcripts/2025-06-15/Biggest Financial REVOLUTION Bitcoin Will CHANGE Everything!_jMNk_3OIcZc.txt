[00:00] I focus on the final boss which is the
[00:01] US dollar Stacks hats and just keep
[00:03] huddling I get the impression that it's
[00:04] almost like a bottle of champagne that
[00:06] we've shaken up but we haven't yet
[00:07] popped the CT once you've taken the
[00:08] orange pill you kind of step away from
[00:10] mainstream how do I decentralize
[00:11] education well I suppose I need to
[00:13] decentralize money first the most
[00:15] skilled people the most talented people
[00:18] the most useful people the most
[00:20] Innovative people have all been
[00:21] self-talk they love to increase their
[00:23] tuition fees they love to fill their
[00:24] courses up with garbage classes and why
[00:27] is it that you know you needed 5 years
[00:28] of education years ago and now you need
[00:31] like 8 9 10 years of education to be
[00:33] able to like get a regular job it
[00:35] basically keeps people longer in that
[00:36] system and it does shape mindset as a
[00:38] guy who's been through University twice
[00:40] if I'd been given certain tools and role
[00:42] models and examples and a bit of
[00:44] encouragement I think I could have
[00:45] selftaught twice as much in half the
[00:47] time what's happening to the families
[00:48] families are getting smaller there are
[00:49] fewer and fewer people having children
[00:51] so that means fewer and fewer families
[00:52] they train us to basically follow orders
[00:55] and not question too much and they're
[00:57] forming us to pay taxes so you don't
[00:59] need to work away like crazy overtime
[01:01] burning out over spending over consuming
[01:04] you'll actually have a higher quality of
[01:05] life with a Bitcoin standard so you will
[01:07] have time to pick up that book you've
[01:09] wanted to read Bitcoin will help us get
[01:10] our time back and with our time back we
[01:13] can delve into things that are more
[01:14] stimulating than spread sheets and
[01:16] traffic and keeping the boss happy
[01:18] scarcity is its beauty its scarcity is
[01:22] its uniqueness and the type of scarcity
[01:25] it has hasn't existed before
[01:28] [Music]
[01:31] I I take a good pride in getting people
[01:34] on that have never been on a podcast so
[01:35] like you being one that already has two
[01:38] podcasts in there like it's the thir
[01:40] like you have more experience than than
[01:42] like some of the some of the people that
[01:44] I have on but I like that I I like
[01:46] people having people on that are not on
[01:50] every podcast because I think it gets
[01:52] boring after after a while yeah I mean
[01:54] there's like there's a lot of repetition
[01:56] at the moment unfortunately with
[01:57] podcasts uh in Bitcoin like uh you know
[02:00] if we haven't got any scandals or
[02:01] anything like FDX blowing up or like
[02:03] some major war going on with ordinals
[02:06] there's not a lot more to say really at
[02:08] the moment CU it's the same Talking
[02:10] Heads you know I kind of got a little
[02:11] bit saturated personally with podcasts
[02:13] as well there's not many I listen to
[02:14] nowadays I listen to other stuff outside
[02:16] of of Bitcoin you know when you work in
[02:19] Bitcoin when you finish your shift at
[02:21] the end of the day you don't want to
[02:22] delve back into Bitcoin all the time so
[02:25] uh these are the things happening in the
[02:26] world so politics and economy and um
[02:30] politics mainly man is crazy at the
[02:32] moment how um how everything's shaping
[02:34] up and it's next week the elections so
[02:37] I've just been keeping my eyes on that
[02:38] is like better than anything on Netflix
[02:39] is the US election story and the
[02:41] campaign so I've watching it's like such
[02:44] a such a epic episode every 24 hours
[02:48] there's like a new event to follow so
[02:50] I've been following it quite a bit Yeah
[02:52] I think uh I mean I think that's always
[02:54] happens with the US election it's such a
[02:57] big event and the Americans make make it
[03:00] also really big and and uh when when El
[03:03] musk the the richest guy on Earth says
[03:04] like oh if Donald Trump doesn't get in
[03:08] uh the office uh democracy will vanish
[03:11] in the next four years like that gets a
[03:13] lot of excitement and a lot of trauma I
[03:15] think it's overdone like I think it's
[03:17] too dramatic because uh literally the
[03:21] the the camela Harris was the last four
[03:24] years vice president and Trump was
[03:26] already president so I don't know if we
[03:29] have a
[03:30] huge change no matter who comes into
[03:32] office because they both kind of were
[03:34] already in the
[03:35] administration uh but it's it's funny to
[03:37] see yeah it definitely takes a lot of uh
[03:39] eyeballs off Bitcoin into politics yeah
[03:43] I think I think that's kind of like uh
[03:44] not a not a bad thing like it for the
[03:47] moment I just can't wait for it to be
[03:48] over I'm wondering what's coming next
[03:49] you know because everything's been
[03:50] building towards this next Tuesday and
[03:52] then obviously it'll be from November
[03:54] till about January until they get sworn
[03:56] in whoever's next but then after that I
[03:58] can't wait to just like you know change
[04:01] the channel like it's like it's like the
[04:03] final series of Game of Thrones you know
[04:05] like you watched it and watched it and
[04:06] watched it and by the end you were just
[04:07] like just finish this
[04:09] now and they did a horrible job at
[04:11] finishing Game of Thrones like the last
[04:12] season was just garbage um but I was
[04:15] just happy it was over I was like I can
[04:16] do other stuff with my life now so but
[04:19] obviously we're all we're all kind of
[04:20] following it and we're all watching
[04:21] what's going on but there's nothing we
[04:22] can do you know I'm not in the US so but
[04:25] we're really close we're really close
[04:27] being in Canada so there's a lot of
[04:28] dependency on
[04:30] on us politics US economy it kind of
[04:33] interesting we hit an all-time high in
[04:35] the Canadian dollar versus Bitcoin on
[04:37] the Bitcoin pairing but they haven't hit
[04:39] an all-time high on the US dollar
[04:41] Bitcoin pairing which just show sorry no
[04:45] sorry go ahead no so uh it just goes to
[04:47] show you know how the the currencies are
[04:50] how how we're losing out the Canadian
[04:52] dollar is losing out on the US dollar
[04:54] I'm not sure how you're in Europe at the
[04:55] moment you in the Euro Zone uh yes uh
[04:59] I'm in the euro Zone and I think we also
[05:01] hit in in the Euro and all-time high I
[05:04] mean in the US dollar we also almost hit
[05:06] it like it's very close to hitting it uh
[05:10] so it's it's it's it's not that much but
[05:12] yeah Euro I think Euro hit it like I
[05:15] honestly I track US dollar more than
[05:18] than Euro because I right that's that's
[05:22] who we competing against like you know
[05:24] some people ask me how much is a Bitcoin
[05:26] and Canadian dollars I'm like I don't
[05:27] really know I don't I you know I focus
[05:29] on the final boss which is the US dollar
[05:32] that's true yeah I I like for the last
[05:36] uh two months I've been tracking the US
[05:38] dollar price in Bitcoin before that
[05:41] there was like a year you asked me what
[05:43] the Bitcoin price is I didn't I didn't
[05:44] even know like because it was so um so
[05:47] boring there was not not a lot of price
[05:49] action uh there was this Autumn high in
[05:52] April with the Haring and stuff like
[05:53] that uh but it it was not really
[05:56] interesting for me for some reason but
[05:58] now I feel like there is more excitement
[06:00] coming like it feels like the start of
[06:02] of of some new excitement the start of
[06:04] something maybe bigger in Bitcoin and
[06:06] all of the yeah we have the election and
[06:08] it's like now also the season for
[06:10] Bitcoin to go up let's see if it
[06:11] actually comes uh but for some reason
[06:13] now I'm been tracking it again yeah yeah
[06:16] I'm looking at it because there's a lot
[06:18] of uh it's a harder the price is even
[06:20] harder to understand now it was always
[06:22] very hard to understand if it's going to
[06:23] go up or down which is why you know the
[06:25] best approach is just to stack SATs and
[06:27] just keep hodling and regardless of
[06:30] price if it goes down you buy more if it
[06:31] goes up you maybe share a meme but um
[06:34] but at the moment with the the ETFs and
[06:37] all of the the huge industry that's
[06:39] packed in and with with the political
[06:41] climate as well it's really hard to know
[06:43] okay what what is controlling the price
[06:45] at the moment I get the impression that
[06:47] it's almost like a bottle of champagne
[06:48] that we've shaken up but we haven't yet
[06:50] popped the C I get that impression but
[06:52] it's just an impression you know
[06:54] anything could happen but I kind of feel
[06:56] like there is some kind of suppression
[06:57] of price going on I feel like there's a
[06:59] lot of people talking about it a lot of
[07:00] people looking at Bitcoin but it's not
[07:03] really moving yet I think we're waiting
[07:05] on on certain things to kind of take
[07:07] place and even historically you know
[07:09] with the having having happened we're
[07:11] right on track you know we where it
[07:12] should be like it's it's it's just a
[07:16] number at the end of the day Bitcoin
[07:17] keeps winning Bitcoin is still running
[07:19] like the the Network's still there and
[07:23] and that's that's what we should be
[07:24] focusing on but obviously yeah price
[07:25] action around this time of year always
[07:27] is always quite interesting but um yeah
[07:29] but I mean it's kind of fascinating
[07:32] actually that we are that high I want to
[07:34] show you this with the interest because
[07:37] like there's there's this first of all
[07:39] like this um personal feeling of of
[07:42] being in Bitcoin and seeing uh what
[07:44] what's going on in in the world of of of
[07:47] Bitcoin uh and then you talk with normas
[07:50] you talk with family members you talk
[07:52] with your colleagues uh and and you're
[07:54] like oh like nobody really cares about
[07:56] Bitcoin right now and we're almost at
[07:57] the alltime high and then I always I go
[08:00] ahead and and I will pull this up uh
[08:04] quite quickly here let me see um the
[08:07] Google Trends chart I always like to
[08:09] look at because this kind of indicates
[08:11] for me uh how many people are Googling
[08:14] it how many how much interest from a
[08:16] retail kind of perspective is in Bitcoin
[08:19] and if you see that like we are so
[08:23] low right now and the price is and is
[08:27] higher than uh it was like around here
[08:30] so it's it's it's fascinating for me to
[08:32] to see that we actually uh having that
[08:35] high price without a lot of excitement
[08:38] it might be just institutional money
[08:40] yeah also I don't know like from
[08:42] following the elections like you realize
[08:44] how many people have plugged into
[08:45] mainstream media and how many people
[08:47] won't even get access to the price you
[08:51] know like people aren't going to just
[08:52] search sporadically like pre-o coiners
[08:54] no bit non- bitcoiners whatever I'm
[08:56] going to be like hey let's check on the
[08:58] Bitcoin price you know people who kind
[08:59] of know what's going on because we're in
[09:01] a subsection of of society you know
[09:03] we're in like a marginal section um but
[09:06] we don't realize it because we spend a
[09:07] lot of time in it you know what I mean
[09:09] it's kind of like an echo chamber a
[09:10] little bit and it's kind of uh once
[09:12] you've taken the orange pill you kind of
[09:13] step away from mainstream stuff um so I
[09:17] kind of forget that like all my well my
[09:19] neighbors my family my friends are all
[09:21] still uh surfing around in what I where
[09:24] I used to be maybe like four years ago
[09:26] so it's a long time that I've just kind
[09:28] of been like okay I'll open up Telegram
[09:29] and Twitter and check my group chats and
[09:32] listen to some live streams but I don't
[09:36] read the newspaper I don't hang out in
[09:38] the in the coffee room at work like
[09:40] talking about like I don't even know
[09:41] what the weather's going to be like
[09:43] anymore like just I just tuned out from
[09:45] like so much stuff just to put all my
[09:47] energy into something that I care about
[09:49] and I think it'll make a difference but
[09:51] then when when when you meet people
[09:53] who've who've not taken that step like
[09:55] you know on falling down whatever you
[09:56] want to call it the rabbit hole the
[09:58] orange pill and you realize like oh my
[10:00] gosh like there's people who we're
[10:04] Worlds Apart I think is is the way to
[10:06] see it so like as an educator in Bitcoin
[10:08] it's it's I'm having to go back and kind
[10:10] of position myself at that part of the
[10:14] journey which is step one step two but
[10:16] it's it's hard to go back to those steps
[10:18] when for myself it was like something
[10:20] that I started on like four or five
[10:22] years ago seriously so um so yeah just
[10:26] kind of working things back because if
[10:29] if if we want to help people get on
[10:30] board with Bitcoin we got to realize
[10:31] that there's there's changes that we've
[10:33] made in our lives that give us a certain
[10:36] perspective and it's not everybody who
[10:39] shares that perspective because they
[10:40] haven't taken those steps yet so you
[10:43] know you you don't want to kind of um
[10:45] radicalize people straight away between
[10:47] having toxic Maxis that just have you
[10:49] know Matrix and Nostra and but at the
[10:53] same time we've got to realize that's
[10:54] where we are right now so if we're
[10:56] talking from that place it's stuff isn't
[10:59] going to land like people aren't going
[11:00] to get what we're talking about like
[11:03] people just think I'm crazy most of the
[11:04] time but like my Bitcoin friends know
[11:06] exactly what I'm talking about did you
[11:08] see the video where they walked around
[11:11] and asked people on the street what the
[11:13] current bitcoin price is yeah who was
[11:16] doing that was that um I think it was
[11:18] like Joe Nakamoto did it a while ago as
[11:20] well and like there's another person
[11:22] being like what do you think the prices
[11:23] and people are just way out you know so
[11:26] completely way out like the the guesses
[11:28] were like yeah like what is it 10 EUR I
[11:30] was like what like that's like not even
[11:32] a little bit close so I think uh to your
[11:35] point I think we actually in uh a time
[11:39] where we are so plugged into this new
[11:42] system already but we kind of forget
[11:45] sometimes that 99% of the world still
[11:48] somewhere else and I started this like a
[11:53] while ago now that I listen again to
[11:56] mainstream media for like two three four
[11:58] minutes and see like the Highlight shows
[12:00] every day uh from Austrian news uh this
[12:03] is quite interesting to see to be honest
[12:06] because I was pluged into this this uh
[12:09] watching mainstream media like also like
[12:11] maybe four or five years ago uh and
[12:14] comparing it now is like wow like I I
[12:17] have a whole different viewpoint on on
[12:19] all those topics now but I think it's
[12:21] important that
[12:23] we um go back like even if we go if we
[12:28] make the Matrix like they break out of
[12:30] the Matrix but they also go in back back
[12:33] in and and fight the evil people in The
[12:36] Matrix uh so I I think it's we kind of
[12:39] have to also fight in the regular system
[12:42] that's why I also don't like when people
[12:43] say like no let's go all to nostal no
[12:46] like we we have to also be on normal
[12:48] platforms and fight there uh for Bitcoin
[12:51] we cannot hide and make like a small
[12:54] parallel uh universe that might work but
[12:57] it probably works better if we uh if we
[13:01] are the digital soldiers that that like
[13:03] are for Bitcoin in those Normy places Al
[13:06] in our family in our neighborhood it's
[13:08] it's so important I feel like yeah I
[13:11] think like the soldiers is like a good
[13:12] example right so like um I've always had
[13:15] this kind of questioning about you know
[13:17] the the Bitcoin Citadel mentality you
[13:20] know like you know the bitcoiners will
[13:22] live up on this hill with their Citadel
[13:24] protected by the walls we'll have
[13:25] everything we need but the Citadel isn't
[13:28] the battle ground right you know the
[13:30] soldiers need to leave the Citadel to
[13:32] March down the hill to meet the the
[13:34] allies and the enemies and the foes and
[13:36] the challenges on the Battleground and I
[13:39] I think that's part of it is is is
[13:41] realizing that we're already very well
[13:44] sheltered from a lot of the [ __ ]
[13:46] that goes on but 99% of the people ain't
[13:49] so you've got to work out that hey if we
[13:51] want to actually do this job of what I
[13:53] still call evangelizing people you know
[13:56] helping them wake up to to what Bitcoin
[13:58] can offer you got to leave the Citadel
[14:00] and it doesn't mean you have to
[14:01] compromise on everything you've built up
[14:03] over the past few years you know as a
[14:04] bitcoiner you can still stay resilient
[14:07] to all of these uh these Normy all like
[14:11] mainstream ways of of kind of moving
[14:14] through information you can go back to
[14:15] the Citadel at the end of the day but if
[14:17] you want to meet people you got to you
[14:19] got to leave that kind of protected
[14:21] gated community that is the Bitcoin
[14:23] Twitter sphere or the the nostr Realms
[14:26] or the the podcasts and the Articles
[14:28] because
[14:29] it's uh it's not what the people who I
[14:32] want to talk to uh are tuned into the
[14:34] people who I want to talk to are the
[14:36] people who are like what wait how how
[14:38] does this work what what's this concept
[14:40] like um those are the interesting
[14:42] conversations for me and that's I
[14:44] suppose why I've tuned out a little bit
[14:46] of of listening to non-stop but Bitcoin
[14:48] podcasts because um and I think that's
[14:51] kind of like what uh you know there was
[14:53] um Peter mccac you know he's he's
[14:55] pivoted recently with his with his
[14:58] podcast which is nice you know I think
[15:00] he's kind of worked it out as well that
[15:03] bitcoiners talking to bitcoiners talking
[15:05] about Bitcoin is kind of very
[15:07] one-dimensional um and it is necessary
[15:10] because you know like uh there'll be
[15:12] people listening to this now who may be
[15:13] listening to their very first Bitcoin
[15:15] podcast and it'll help give them an idea
[15:18] of of what's going on and it's always a
[15:20] good entry point or people can delve
[15:21] people have very like certain guests
[15:23] they really love to listen to I have
[15:25] like some top bitcoiners whatever they
[15:27] make any content I'll tune into
[15:29] but um a lot of the time like my my job
[15:32] here at B Bitcoin is is evangelization
[15:34] and and helping people understand
[15:36] Bitcoin and people who've listened to
[15:38] like you know they've done the 10,000
[15:40] hours they they're probably like Way
[15:43] Beyond what I can tell them right you
[15:45] know so um I'm just trying to leave the
[15:48] Citadel a little bit and get out of the
[15:49] comfort zone I think it is a bit of a
[15:51] comfort zone when it comes to Orange
[15:54] billing people and I think like Bitcoin
[15:56] educators are kind of stepping out now
[15:58] and it's nice to see like more and more
[16:00] Educators like reaching out and making
[16:01] public events and risking a bit of their
[16:04] uh reputation Maybe by being like hey
[16:06] I'm going to put on an event but I don't
[16:07] know if anyone's going to show up and
[16:09] you know everybody I talk to it does
[16:11] meetups or like uh me Premier bit coin
[16:14] courses or um presentations like they
[16:18] all get back to me being like yeah there
[16:20] was like zero people showed up or like
[16:22] yeah there were three people showed up
[16:24] but they tweet it anyway and they ad
[16:26] advertise it anyway and they'll say like
[16:28] yeah I'm here and no one's here and it's
[16:30] okay like I I think that's necessary now
[16:33] that's the next step because we can't
[16:35] control The Narrative of the mainstream
[16:37] but we
[16:38] can't withdraw completely from
[16:41] mainstream discussions with with people
[16:43] who are in that sphere it's got to be
[16:45] something that uh that we can kind of uh
[16:49] yeah that that we can kind of like
[16:51] challenge people on and I think that's
[16:53] where the battlefield is at the moment
[16:54] for me absolutely and I always think
[16:57] back of like this video of Andreas
[17:00] andopolis staying in this like half
[17:02] empty room in front of like a few people
[17:05] and explaining Bitcoin uh and at that
[17:08] time if someone watched it it probably
[17:11] looked even sad like oh like oh this is
[17:13] this new thing but nobody cares about it
[17:15] and and he's talking about it and now 10
[17:18] years later we all say like oh that was
[17:20] a legendary moment like he got it so
[17:23] early
[17:24] on no that's totally right like um
[17:28] looking it's always the question and it
[17:30] doesn't matter if it's about buying
[17:31] Bitcoin like you know if if you look
[17:33] back to when you bought Bitcoin for the
[17:35] first time it was the smartest thing you
[17:37] probably did I know that's how I see it
[17:39] but like hindsight is always 2020 like I
[17:41] love that expression I use it a lot but
[17:43] the way we look back on the past is like
[17:44] wow like for the Antonopoulos example
[17:46] you just gave perfect one those are like
[17:48] classic moments those are like wow like
[17:51] that was such a pivotal moment exactly
[17:53] the way it was explained at that point
[17:55] in time was super important to the
[17:57] evolution of of learning about Bitcoin
[17:59] but at the time if you were in the room
[18:01] you'd be like what's this guy talking
[18:02] about you know like if if it's the time
[18:05] that makes a difference so I'm hoping
[18:08] that eventually you know I can look back
[18:09] on the stuff that I'm doing and be like
[18:10] yeah you remember that Meetup where no
[18:12] one showed up that was awesome like one
[18:14] of my buddies always tells me he's like
[18:16] we'll look back when we're old men and
[18:18] we'll be like these were the good old
[18:20] days you know like um I don't want to
[18:23] get too comfortable by just being like
[18:24] hanging out with bitcoiners and talking
[18:26] Bitcoin all the time I want to be a
[18:27] little bit uncomfortable and
[18:29] and uh try and try and meet some people
[18:32] who who don't agree with me and try and
[18:34] try and have the discussions and and
[18:37] make it work or show up to empty rooms
[18:38] and hand out flyers that people throw
[18:40] out you know I think it's it's what we
[18:43] got to
[18:44] do absolutely and I think uh to to the
[18:47] earlier point that we made I think it's
[18:49] also important for us to get an identity
[18:52] outside of Bitcoin like like bitcoiner
[18:55] like right now it's leged if you are
[18:58] Bitcoin coer uh because it's just such a
[19:01] huge topic and there's such a huge
[19:03] interest in it but at some point Bitcoin
[19:06] will be quite boring uh itself there
[19:09] might be interesting stuff happening on
[19:11] top of Bitcoin uh but Bitcoin the
[19:14] protocol it will be like everyone is
[19:16] like ah of course Bitcoin like it's like
[19:18] the TCP protocol like everyone agrees on
[19:20] it kind of fine to the Future I'm
[19:22] talking uh so like we have to have to
[19:26] get an identity outside of of being a
[19:30] bitcoiner and and have other interests
[19:32] also so I think it's a healthy thing
[19:35] where bitcoiners that are already long
[19:37] in the in the game that get like
[19:39] saturated of of Bitcoin content and they
[19:42] might like oh like I want to find out
[19:44] about new stuff I want to listen to
[19:46] other things I want to I don't know
[19:47] learn how to play
[19:49] guitar something and but there's at the
[19:52] same time new people coming that just
[19:54] like start in year one and they have to
[19:56] learn all those things that their
[19:58] experience Bitcoin Has the Last 5 Years
[20:00] heard so I think it's great that we have
[20:02] so much Bitcoin only content uh but yes
[20:05] I also see like new people coming slowly
[20:08] and Aller people maybe saying like oh
[20:11] like I I I grow out a little bit of that
[20:14] uh I I I listen to a few and fewer
[20:17] podcast for me when I started the
[20:19] podcast this was kind of the moment
[20:20] where I stopped listening to other
[20:22] podcast because I do it daily so my
[20:24] Bitcoin podcast is kind of dead so I
[20:27] understand uh if you work 100% in
[20:30] Bitcoin um you're kind of like you like
[20:33] I I want to be uh outside of Bitcoin
[20:36] like the last two hours of my day yeah H
[20:39] but for but for people that like have
[20:41] the whole day and they're doing
[20:42] something else they really look forward
[20:45] maybe to a Bitcoin podcast and and tune
[20:47] in out from the out out of the feat
[20:50] world but in the Bitcoin world with
[20:52] those podcast so so I think the it's
[20:54] it's a great place to to be in and I
[20:57] think it's great that we have so many
[20:58] options also yeah when like um I totally
[21:01] agree with that I think it's like the 80
[21:03] 20% ratio like um you know before I was
[21:06] working in Bitcoin before I was lucky
[21:07] enough to to find my place in Bitcoin I
[21:09] was probably like 80% was Fiat job and
[21:13] you know regular life and punching in
[21:15] punching out and talking with colleagues
[21:17] and and then 20% was like getting home
[21:19] and like putting on podcasts and making
[21:21] food and just trying to like uh like tap
[21:23] into something different and over the
[21:25] last few years I've managed to flip that
[21:27] ratio so now it's like 80% of my time is
[21:30] is doing all of the Bitcoin stuff and
[21:32] talking with my colleagues about Bitcoin
[21:34] and and about everything around Bitcoin
[21:37] as well we have some really awesome
[21:38] conversations as bitcoiners and then the
[21:40] 20% is like okay end of the day I'm just
[21:42] going to watch some garbage or tune back
[21:44] in or like listen to the the radio or
[21:46] play some music or you know do other
[21:48] stuff but I think like um I'm not sure
[21:51] how many people in Bitcoin actually are
[21:54] in bit Bitcoin cuz they they want to do
[21:57] something else later on
[21:59] and they see that Bitcoin is the way to
[22:00] get there I think there's a lot of
[22:02] people like for example it's true for
[22:04] myself a little bit of history about
[22:05] myself I used to like my first jobs were
[22:08] um were working in finance I used to
[22:10] work in trfi and I realized they
[22:12] couldn't change anything in trfi you
[22:13] know I wanted to change like the
[22:14] allocation of Assets in mutual funds I
[22:17] was like man we should like we shouldn't
[22:18] fund these garbage companies we should
[22:20] have like really awesome Investments for
[22:22] our clients and and I realized quickly
[22:25] like buddy you work on the phones and
[22:27] customer support you no one's going to
[22:29] listen to you about which assets the
[22:31] fund manager should select so I was like
[22:34] okay I could spend my entire life trying
[22:35] to climb that ladder to be an important
[22:37] Guy where I can make decisions that
[22:39] would would kind of change finance and I
[22:42] was like I don't want to do that because
[22:44] involved doing a lot of things that a
[22:46] lot of time and I'm put putting a lot of
[22:48] time and energy into something that you
[22:49] don't believe in to eventually try and
[22:50] make the change at the end um which I
[22:53] think is what a lot of people try and do
[22:55] in careers you know you're like hey I'll
[22:56] just put in 20 years of my life and when
[22:57] it's my turn I'll make everything better
[23:00] I was like man that's such a a bad way
[23:02] around to do things so then I pivoted
[23:04] and I I left finance and I went to work
[23:05] in education because I was like I can
[23:07] make a difference straight away right
[23:08] you know I'll be like in a classroom
[23:10] I'll have students and uh we'll have fun
[23:13] and we'll learn together and you know I
[23:15] can make a lot of decisions immediately
[23:17] you know like they they frontload you as
[23:19] a teacher you have to decide everything
[23:20] straight away about how you run your
[23:22] class but then I actually realized that
[23:24] it's not that true you know as a teacher
[23:27] there are there are core things that you
[23:28] still can't change and it's to do with
[23:30] the curriculum and it's to do with um
[23:32] you know I I was becoming a student
[23:34] teacher during Co so just just the way
[23:37] that um there were so many rules
[23:39] restrictions and requirements and and I
[23:43] was like wow this is really as
[23:45] institutionalized as Finance but it's
[23:47] public versus
[23:49] private I was like man what's the
[23:52] problem with both of these
[23:54] things and then I was learning about
[23:56] Bitcoin and I learned that magical word
[23:58] d centralization I was like okay so
[24:00] bitcoin's
[24:02] decentralized but that's kind of what
[24:04] the issue is with education and that's
[24:06] kind of what the issue is with Finance
[24:07] as well right I was like okay so
[24:09] everything I suppose needs to be a
[24:10] little bit decentralized we liveed in a
[24:12] post globalist world and governments
[24:15] have got bigger and bigger and control
[24:17] more and more spheres of our lives and
[24:18] so do the corporations and the dots so
[24:22] it's like hey like this decentralization
[24:24] concept is
[24:25] amazing but I want I still want to
[24:27] return to teaching right you know I
[24:29] still see myself as a teacher first and
[24:30] a bitcoiner second but I don't want to
[24:33] teach in centralized
[24:35] education because it's not my way of
[24:37] teach it's not it's not what I believe
[24:38] in right and that's why I had to leave
[24:41] so I was like well how do I decentralize
[24:43] education I was like well I suppose I
[24:45] need to decentralize money
[24:47] first so that so this was like a long
[24:50] way and it might take my entire life I
[24:52] might never get there but eventually I
[24:53] want to move back into the classroom
[24:55] once we've separated money from State
[24:58] then will be able to separate education
[25:00] from State and have a lot more like
[25:02] local based curriculums and like I do a
[25:05] bit of homeschooling at the moment as
[25:06] well but it these are like some of the
[25:08] core values that you learn as a
[25:09] bitcoiner and then you want to implement
[25:11] them into the rest of your life but you
[25:13] work out real quickly that you can't do
[25:14] until we've fixed the
[25:16] money
[25:17] so your your your kind of call to action
[25:20] is like well if you want to do this
[25:22] thing later in life you got to fix the
[25:23] money first it's it's like it's like the
[25:25] the point of that you can't skip past
[25:29] like you know I could go back into
[25:31] Finance I could go back into education
[25:33] but if I thought about it enough the
[25:34] problem of the broken money that we use
[25:36] and the way it's used against us rather
[25:38] than for us would would become a problem
[25:41] I think that's why I work in Bitcoin you
[25:42] know is not because I want to like be an
[25:45] old man at 85 still working in Bitcoin
[25:47] you know like I want to fix the things
[25:50] that Bitcoin proposes to fix and then go
[25:52] about doing other things you know I want
[25:54] to teach I love teaching especially
[25:56] working with young people like I think
[25:58] their imaginations the way they pick up
[26:00] information the way they have enthusiasm
[26:02] is awesome but I can't do that until
[26:04] like we have a slightly better Bitcoin
[26:06] standard maybe not hyperbitcoinization
[26:08] but until you know there are enough
[26:10] families that are like hey we don't need
[26:12] to put our kids through the government
[26:13] public system there's all these other
[26:15] schools and school boards and
[26:18] cooperatives where we can decentralize
[26:20] education decide what our kids are
[26:21] learning and help our kids learn and
[26:22] play a better role in their education
[26:24] and that's what I'd like to do
[26:25] eventually and I'm not sure if that's
[26:27] true for a lot of bitcoiners out but I
[26:28] think it is like I think when I talk
[26:31] with my colleagues like everybody has
[26:32] these later on projects like oh after
[26:34] we've won the war about sound money I'll
[26:36] do this right um I'm not sure how many
[26:39] people are bitcoiners because they just
[26:41] want to be forever bitcoiners I think
[26:43] it's just we see it as a necessary step
[26:45] to get to where we want to
[26:48] go I love that view I think I never had
[26:50] that like that on on the podcast and uh
[26:56] I loved it a lot it's one of the reasons
[26:58] why I renamed my podcast from a Bitcoin
[27:01] brand to just my name because I was like
[27:04] I will not talk about Bitcoin all my
[27:07] life if Bitcoin becomes boring for me
[27:09] because it's already so successful I
[27:11] will stop talking about it on the
[27:12] podcast like because uh it then the
[27:16] podcast will suck if if I'm not
[27:18] generally interested in in the topic
[27:20] obviously uh I don't know when this
[27:22] happens because I think the next like
[27:24] three to five years will be super super
[27:26] interesting maybe even like 10 years but
[27:28] beyond 10 years I don't know if it's
[27:31] still uh interesting uh to
[27:34] be talking about Bitcoin every day uh
[27:38] but yeah for the next five years I'm I'm
[27:40] fairly certain that it will be super
[27:43] interesting uh to be in that space and
[27:46] maybe beyond that not that much one
[27:49] interesting point also for for what you
[27:51] said is
[27:52] decentralized um education I mean I got
[27:57] from like age 17 or 18 I kind of
[28:01] discovered online education if it's like
[28:04] audiobooks podcasts YouTube online
[28:06] courses s academy uh stuff like that
[28:09] there's a lot of on there on there that
[28:11] kind of educated me a lot like I I mean
[28:15] I I consumed a lot I was like consuming
[28:19] me too much and and not doing enough
[28:22] about it but it was really good uh and
[28:25] the rest of that what I learned was
[28:26] maybe in the job uh from from what I
[28:28] know now and a little bit was from the
[28:30] education system so I think we are um if
[28:33] you really want to get educated
[28:35] decentralized it's already possible uh
[28:38] but homeschooling and especially the
[28:42] education before age 16 I would say
[28:46] that's a huge part and that's the
[28:48] influential part I think what you also
[28:50] talking about yeah no I think like your
[28:53] path is like totally um totally the
[28:56] perfect example of where we're at at the
[28:58] moment you know the the most skilled
[29:02] people the most talented people the most
[29:04] useful people um the most Innovative
[29:07] people have all been self-taught pretty
[29:09] much right I mean like um everybody
[29:12] who's running some type of interesting
[29:14] projects there's been yeah a kind of
[29:17] foundational base of of institutional
[29:19] education but then to become the person
[29:21] they are like the most interesting
[29:23] people out there they're all self-taught
[29:25] you know um information has been
[29:28] decentralized but education hasn't yet
[29:30] so we're at this kind of friction point
[29:32] where we have access to all the
[29:34] information we need right now so for the
[29:37] motivated and for the driven and for the
[29:39] intellectual folks like that's great
[29:41] like you know the the valves are open
[29:43] you have access to all information go
[29:45] ahead and devour it and synthesize it
[29:46] and process it and integrate it and get
[29:49] out there and use it but then uh then
[29:53] for the people who aren't on that side
[29:55] of the bell curve right you know it's
[29:57] it's still like no well I I'll just go
[29:59] to through the through the system and
[30:01] they'll give me a good education and
[30:04] that's less and less true like the
[30:05] system's giving you a worse and worse
[30:07] education like and I'm not sure if it's
[30:09] worse and worse but it's becoming like
[30:11] um I had a term for it the other day
[30:13] basically we're seeing like Fiat
[30:15] education because you know we are
[30:17] getting slightly better competencies and
[30:19] skills but I remember like in my um in
[30:22] my uh if you look back across
[30:25] Generations you see like what was
[30:28] essential to have as education like my
[30:29] dad dropped out of secondary school and
[30:31] that was like you know you needed your
[30:33] Secondary School to get a job good job
[30:34] he went into trades and he picked stuff
[30:36] up and he was more manual so he lived a
[30:38] good life and he went from there into a
[30:40] master's degree like out of nowhere as
[30:42] as you know when he was 40 years old but
[30:45] in his in his growing up period in his
[30:48] generation like you needed secondary
[30:50] school that was like the requirement and
[30:53] then you go a little bit further down
[30:55] the road and you needed like some kind
[30:58] of secondary education so in the UK we
[31:00] have like a college and in Canada they
[31:02] have like a CP and things so you needed
[31:04] that that became like the new
[31:06] standard and nowadays young people have
[31:09] to get a job at a university a a diploma
[31:12] through a university to get get the
[31:14] chance of having any type of
[31:15] bureaucratic admin whatever Fiat job
[31:18] they want to get so I'm not sure if it's
[31:20] like they're inflating education you
[31:23] know what I mean because you have to
[31:25] spend longer and longer in the system to
[31:27] get a a workable
[31:29] education so you know people are
[31:32] becoming long more and more dependent on
[31:35] the educational system for a lot longer
[31:36] of their time to be able to be released
[31:39] into society as de you know fit citizens
[31:43] who can then go out and get a job and
[31:46] I'm not sure if like the job I do today
[31:48] is a lot more complicated than the job
[31:50] that say my dad would have done in in
[31:53] the 50s or 60s like you know I do work
[31:55] with a computer but it doesn't take like
[31:59] um all of these like critical theory
[32:02] literature analysis courses or like
[32:04] philos you know you can self te all of
[32:07] the stuff you want to do to make
[32:08] yourself grow as an individual but in
[32:11] terms of like um the requirements to get
[32:14] a job I think they've inflated that so
[32:16] much now that and the institutions like
[32:19] the universities absolutely love it they
[32:20] love to increase their tuition fees and
[32:22] they love to extend with they love to
[32:24] fill their courses up with garbage
[32:26] classes and
[32:28] I think we are seeing like an inflation
[32:30] of Education as well and it's probably
[32:32] related to the money I mean everything
[32:34] is so why is it that you know you needed
[32:37] five years of education 50 years ago and
[32:40] now you need like pretty much like I
[32:42] don't know eight nine 10 years of
[32:44] education to be able to like get a
[32:46] regular job working for the a company or
[32:48] a government I'm not sure but um it
[32:51] basically keeps people longer in that
[32:53] system and it does shape mindsets it
[32:54] stops it actually instead of broadening
[32:57] Horizons like the self-learned
[32:59] homeschooled or you know the people who
[33:01] are out there traveling or just picking
[33:02] up experience or working I think it
[33:05] actually blinkers your experience the
[33:07] longer you spend in the in in the
[33:09] education system the more you get
[33:10] blinkers so I don't know I just I just
[33:13] see it as like a a kind of centralized
[33:15] Force that's becoming more and more
[33:18] required but less and less relevant
[33:21] because information's been released so
[33:23] why not release the students you know
[33:25] set them loose give them a work if they
[33:28] want to but um I don't see why we should
[33:31] be clinging to this thing as like a must
[33:33] and an essential you know if you want to
[33:35] be a doctor in engineer fine you need to
[33:36] go through those levels but um as a guys
[33:39] who as a guy who's been through
[33:40] University twice like I could have
[33:42] selftaught everything in half the time
[33:44] if I'd been given certain tools and role
[33:46] models and examples and a bit of
[33:48] encouragement I think I could have
[33:50] selftaught twice as much in half the
[33:52] time I partnered up with coin vigilante
[33:56] this is the most beautiful
[33:58] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[34:00] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[34:03] love it so much coin vigilante made in
[34:06] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[34:09] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[34:12] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[34:15] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[34:18] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[34:21] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[34:24] watch collections you have the date of
[34:27] the first ever Mind Bitcoin Block in
[34:30] there and of course also the block
[34:32] height and which Epoch we are currently
[34:35] in I love the level of detail they put
[34:38] in in this masterpiece and make sure to
[34:41] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[34:43] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[34:46] love those watches so so much if you
[34:50] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[34:52] regular basis I'll guess you already
[34:54] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[34:56] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[35:00] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[35:02] personal recommendation for Hardware
[35:04] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[35:07] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[35:09] gift for a friend who has still their
[35:11] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[35:14] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[35:17] checkout visit bitbox do Swiss robobin
[35:21] to get your bitbox and the next step is
[35:24] to really level up your sovereignty as
[35:27] an individual visual you have to have
[35:29] the most secure self custody setup you
[35:31] have to secure your own devices you have
[35:34] to protect your privacy you have to set
[35:37] up an inheritance plan and depending on
[35:40] where you live you even want to have a
[35:42] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[35:45] in case something goes really really
[35:47] wrong and through all those steps the
[35:49] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[35:52] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[35:55] way.com SLP partners Robin you even get
[35:58] a 30 minute free call to find out how
[36:01] you can level up your sovereignty I see
[36:05] that a lot actually um in in theit in in
[36:08] the bit Community less and less but even
[36:10] from them uh who are maybe older and
[36:13] didn't discover Bitcoin first but also
[36:14] like in in the normal Community where
[36:16] people come out of with like 28 32 from
[36:20] University and never really worked for
[36:22] anything like they they just studied all
[36:25] their lives basically uh and then they
[36:27] come to know like oh yeah like this
[36:29] degree is kind of required for like a
[36:31] high level job but they don't know they
[36:34] don't know what's going on in in in the
[36:36] actual job market and then uh they might
[36:39] be in like a big Fiat company where uh
[36:44] they they they're like just like stuck
[36:46] with that what they actually wanted to
[36:48] escape with with the university like
[36:50] there's a um intellectural Gap there and
[36:53] it it's really interesting for me to to
[36:55] look at um that that field education Sy
[36:58] I never thought of uh the education
[37:00] system being inflated but it's true like
[37:03] more more people need longer and longer
[37:05] it also delays uh people having kids uh
[37:09] um uh later and later because they're
[37:13] like yeah I'm done with my studies with
[37:15] like 28 I need a good income for my kid
[37:18] then it's like 32 and then it's like oh
[37:21] I have kids with 35 or 40 uh previous
[37:25] like uh in my mom's and dad's generation
[37:28] it was like yeah you have kids with like
[37:29] 25 or like something like that or like
[37:31] maybe even it was not abnormal to have
[37:33] kids with like 23 or something like that
[37:35] so it's really interesting how this
[37:37] money and centralized education and this
[37:40] feeld system and then on the birth rates
[37:42] and like this all kind of somehow is
[37:46] connected and this this old saying fix
[37:48] the money fix fix the world it it it
[37:52] might actually be true yeah yeah no I
[37:55] think so and I think like that example
[37:57] that used of like the
[37:59] family as a key metric like if we see
[38:02] that the family is the smallest unit of
[38:05] society you know um and then a family
[38:08] you know includes children and children
[38:10] are sent into the education
[38:12] system then they spend long you know
[38:16] what's happening to the families
[38:17] families are getting smaller families
[38:18] are being less and less you know um
[38:22] there are there there are fewer and
[38:23] fewer people having children so that
[38:25] means fewer and fewer families so if
[38:26] we're measuring Society is like if we're
[38:29] taking family as the measurement of how
[38:31] successful a society is then actually
[38:33] Society is not doing as well as it used
[38:35] to be because families are getting
[38:36] smaller and people are struggling to
[38:38] have families uh economically and just
[38:40] just in terms of time preference but you
[38:42] know if we look at education and the
[38:44] impact it has on
[38:45] families then that's huge right and if
[38:47] you were to decentralize education then
[38:50] the decentralization process and that's
[38:52] what you see with homeschools
[38:54] homeschools is like you know the
[38:55] opposite end of that decentralization
[38:57] process it it essentially puts the
[38:59] family at the center of the
[39:01] education and you know I think that
[39:05] there is kind of uh you know
[39:07] there's there's a spectrum of what you
[39:09] can do between like Allin for the public
[39:11] system and then Allin for the home
[39:13] school there's there's Hybrid models and
[39:15] there's different ways that parents use
[39:16] resources locally and in in local
[39:19] communities but um I suppose what you've
[39:21] got to do is put the family back in the
[39:23] education system you know so the family
[39:25] has a bit more control because if we
[39:27] want a successful Society we need to
[39:29] have successful families and if the
[39:32] families are being removed from
[39:33] education then we end up that the
[39:36] education decides a lot of things and
[39:38] the negative impact is on the family
[39:39] like you know if you go through the
[39:41] basic education system of like secondary
[39:43] school then post education you get a
[39:44] bachelor's and then you leave and you
[39:45] get a professional job and like you said
[39:47] you have to work a few years to get a
[39:49] good revenue and a good income that you
[39:50] can have a family with then that's yeah
[39:52] it's it's becoming quite late and it's
[39:54] becoming later and later but if you want
[39:56] to be a specialist like I have certain
[39:58] friends who you know they do the
[39:59] Bachelor then the Masters then the doct
[40:01] the
[40:02] PHD and like that lifestyle like um you
[40:06] know it's it's very much in the brain
[40:07] but then when you finish and you're like
[40:09] okay I've got my PhD then when shows up
[40:12] the family because that's quite late in
[40:14] life you know that's uh that's late 20s
[40:16] early 30s um and and then like you just
[40:20] need to Pivot like that and be like okay
[40:22] career and family let's go um I don't
[40:25] know but uh it they never teach you how
[40:27] to work really the educations I always
[40:29] found it really funny they never really
[40:30] I remember the first time I got a job I
[40:32] was like maybe 12 years old I was too
[40:34] young to work but anyway I worked in a
[40:35] local pub in the UK and um I just stood
[40:38] there like waiting to be told what to do
[40:41] and like I lasted a week in this job and
[40:43] I got fired they had to let me go they
[40:46] were like you're way too young you don't
[40:47] know how to work and I was like that's
[40:49] right I learned that at 12 I was like I
[40:51] don't know how to work and like all the
[40:53] way through the my following education
[40:55] like I knew how to respond to s that
[40:57] were given to me and I knew how to wait
[41:00] and for exam season and study and cram
[41:03] and write a paper because they told me
[41:05] what they require and when it's due by
[41:07] and what I should be approaching it you
[41:09] know they give you a lot of structure
[41:11] but then in the work space you don't get
[41:14] that structure all the time spoonfed to
[41:16] you like the education system does so
[41:18] you become quite dependent and this is
[41:19] this it's hilarious when people leave
[41:21] whatever whether they leave at secondary
[41:22] school or like after University or even
[41:25] like as a postdoc whatever
[41:28] then they arrive in the workplace and
[41:30] it's like okay they wait to be given
[41:32] work to be done and a deadline and
[41:34] sometimes you just got to get out there
[41:35] and hustle and and find work and create
[41:38] work and collaborate and and all of
[41:41] these things that have to be from
[41:43] yourself you have to be quite driven in
[41:45] a different way and I think the
[41:46] education system you're always waiting
[41:48] for them to tell you what to do um and
[41:51] how to do it and then you're waiting for
[41:53] their approval which is the way you
[41:56] measure your success in education but
[41:58] work doesn't really work like that you
[41:59] have to just get out there and sometimes
[42:01] not care what people think if you want
[42:03] to innovate and sometimes if there's
[42:05] nothing to do you have to find something
[42:06] to do and sometimes if it's not clear
[42:09] you have to sculpt a we at a project
[42:10] that's you're not sure where it's going
[42:12] yet but you sure it'll work out and
[42:14] driving towards those type of solutions
[42:16] is something that I think they kind of
[42:17] shy away from in the traditional
[42:18] education system as well so it doesn't
[42:20] really create the best habits um and
[42:23] again self-taught people don't have
[42:26] those those backs because they've driven
[42:28] themselves they will read books that
[42:30] they're not sure why they're reading it
[42:32] but eventually down the line it becomes
[42:33] really useful and they're like wow okay
[42:35] I'm forming this sense of of my
[42:38] intellectual identity myself rather than
[42:40] getting spoonfed it and those people are
[42:42] are great assets and I think that's
[42:45] that's something that like um countries
[42:46] like El Salvador are working out they
[42:48] were like we need these people to come
[42:49] in you know and that's why they're
[42:51] handing out they had a great passport
[42:53] program and they were like if you
[42:54] studied philosophy like we're going to
[42:55] bring you in or like if you're like
[42:58] an entrepreneur and you have businesses
[42:59] we're going to bring you in they can
[43:00] tell who the self-driven people are and
[43:03] I I think like education system isn't
[43:05] really the self-driven
[43:06] people do do you think with with a
[43:09] Bitcoin standard uh on a global world do
[43:12] you think we we get to a place where
[43:14] more of those people actually exist like
[43:17] we we have a higher percentage of the
[43:19] self-driven self-taught people and less
[43:22] of like uh yeah I'm in this line and I
[43:25] will will do exactly as I told like this
[43:27] factory work mentality I think so I
[43:31] think so and that's mainly because like
[43:33] um it's mainly not going to directly
[43:35] affect the education system but maybe
[43:38] indirectly affect well there'll be
[43:40] there'll be two aspects right so the the
[43:41] government's role and how they control
[43:42] the money and how they formers to
[43:44] basically pay taxes later on they're
[43:46] kind of incentives
[43:48] to you know where they call the the the
[43:51] department like human resources right
[43:53] when you go to any big company they have
[43:55] a human resources team so that kind of
[43:58] approach of like we're just resources
[43:59] for them I think that's like really
[44:02] ingrained in the education system as
[44:03] well like you know they they trainers to
[44:05] basically follow orders and not question
[44:09] too much and basically get the job and
[44:13] you know they they're forming us to pay
[44:14] taxes that's that's the government's
[44:16] main interest in education is to make
[44:19] good citizens and good citizens pay
[44:21] their taxes and don't question too much
[44:23] right so you know that's that's one
[44:25] aspect so if you separate the state from
[44:27] money they're going to have less power
[44:29] over us to to manipulate us that way for
[44:31] sure and less less fear to install and
[44:34] less violence to inflict through the tax
[44:37] system but also on the flip side of
[44:39] things you know you're going to have a
[44:40] higher quality of life like your money
[44:42] in the future is worth money more than
[44:44] your money in the present so you you
[44:45] know your time preference changes so you
[44:47] don't need
[44:48] to work away like crazy overtime burning
[44:51] out over spending over consuming like
[44:55] you know you'll actually have a higher
[44:56] quality of life with a Bitcoin standard
[44:58] so you will have time to pick up that
[45:00] book you've wanted to read you won't
[45:02] have to sit for hours in traffic you
[45:04] know you can you can tune back into what
[45:08] is more essential and you can take care
[45:10] of your family and spend more time you
[45:11] know I think we'll get our time back
[45:14] essentially is what I'm saying we'll get
[45:16] a bit more of our time back and then
[45:17] it's it's it's something that you hear
[45:19] in technology and I've heard it like you
[45:20] know I'm I'm like 37 at the moment but
[45:22] I've heard it maybe like every 5 years
[45:24] there'll be something in technology that
[45:26] comes about and it'll be like oh we'll
[45:27] get our time back again you know like it
[45:29] was like oh the computer is going to do
[45:31] all these calculations for us so we'll
[45:32] get our time back and then they put the
[45:34] internet on the computer and it's like
[45:35] ah the internet's got all the
[45:36] information we'll get our time back and
[45:38] AI comes out and it's like hey AI come
[45:40] out and we'll get our time back and so
[45:43] far it's never worked we just spend more
[45:45] and more time on that technology you
[45:47] know I like I come from a region in in
[45:50] in the UK where you know the Industrial
[45:52] Revolution was was pretty much birthed
[45:54] in the area that I grew up in
[45:58] and uh when the first machines came out
[46:00] they were like ah this is great like
[46:01] we'll be able to like weave so much more
[46:03] like textiles we'll get our time back
[46:06] and it's never been true and I've always
[46:09] had like uh they call them the Lites you
[46:11] know the people who fought against the
[46:12] machines when they were first created of
[46:14] it's ironic I work on a computer I'm
[46:16] talking to you via a computer I work in
[46:18] Bitcoin and I work you know I have like
[46:20] four screens around me at the moment but
[46:23] I've always had something deep down
[46:24] which is a bit of like a lite kind of
[46:26] like Rage Against Against the Machine
[46:27] like we don't need the machine
[46:29] eventually the machine will give us our
[46:31] time back and I I think it wasn't even
[46:34] ever about the machine I think it was
[46:36] more about the money you know the the
[46:39] the the the capital incentives were
[46:42] implant technology
[46:44] and increase our our Reliance on
[46:47] technology rather than technology doing
[46:49] its own thing like and it's nice like
[46:51] Bitcoin just does work right it it
[46:53] doesn't take for me anyway it doesn't
[46:55] take I don't need to like
[46:57] crank up Bitcoin every morning like it's
[46:59] just working for me in the background
[47:00] and I don't trade it you know I I don't
[47:02] have to like stop loss and take profit
[47:05] and try and outsmart it like I just let
[47:07] it do its thing um and it does its thing
[47:10] with with my time and energy that I've
[47:12] saved and I've banked it and I've put it
[47:15] into Bitcoin so slowly but surely I am
[47:17] actually getting my time back I can feel
[47:19] it like you know in the last four years
[47:21] like my time preference is changing it's
[47:23] not just a concept it's uh you know you
[47:26] start slowly thinking hey like that
[47:29] maybe this this is the technology that
[47:31] will give us our time back it's it's not
[47:33] going to be like the and you know I
[47:36] could look back in this in 10 years and
[47:37] be like we were wrong but right about
[47:39] now where I'm sat Robin like and and
[47:41] everything I've learned about Bitcoin I
[47:43] I do believe I do believe I believe I
[47:46] hate saying I do believe I believe that
[47:49] Bitcoin will help us get our time back
[47:51] and with our time back we
[47:53] can we can delve into things that are
[47:56] more stimulating than spreadsheets and
[47:58] traffic and keeping the boss happy you
[48:01] know we can actually live we can learn
[48:02] the guitar like you were saying we can
[48:04] read that book that's been on our
[48:05] shelves for a long time and we can spend
[48:07] more time with family and friends I
[48:09] honestly think the way that money is is
[48:11] the base measurement of our time and
[48:13] energy if the money's broken then we're
[48:16] debasing our time and energy but if we
[48:17] fix the money then we can get our time
[48:20] back and and dedicate our energy to more
[48:22] things that are that please us a bit
[48:24] more so I I think that's where like
[48:27] um Bitcoin and education
[48:31] crossover because there's so many people
[48:33] there who do deep down have the
[48:35] potential to or the the drive to just
[48:38] self- te and or create it doesn't even
[48:40] need to be about like what you know it's
[48:42] about what you do like I have a lot of
[48:43] friends who are artists but the Bitcoin
[48:45] artists are the ones who are getting
[48:46] their time back so they're spending more
[48:48] and more time on the rod and I know a
[48:49] few full-time Bitcoin artist but if I
[48:51] know I talk to anybody else that was an
[48:53] artist that tried doing the artist thing
[48:55] it didn't work out cuz they
[48:57] they couldn't get the time they needed
[48:59] to to just do that thing but the
[49:00] bitcoiners are working it out and the
[49:03] bitcoiners are learning to sale and
[49:04] we'll be building houses and we'll be
[49:06] looking after families and we'll be um
[49:09] you know that's amazing
[49:12] yeah yeah I think that's such an amazing
[49:15] point because if if if you just like
[49:19] increase your earning capability of
[49:23] course at some point you will also be
[49:25] financially free and and be have more
[49:27] time but what's way more powerful is
[49:30] than the capital accumulation so like if
[49:33] if you save your money in US dollar
[49:37] which is still the the best out of the
[49:39] worst uh and then uh you lose your time
[49:45] o over time like you lose it's a funny
[49:48] you lose your financial energy over time
[49:50] so for example my podcast um is is is
[49:54] great like it it it it grows and and
[49:57] with AI and with all those tools that I
[49:59] have I'm actually able to do that daily
[50:01] even though I'm alone uh so like with
[50:04] with time it it will bring more and I
[50:08] might be more efficient because of the
[50:10] technology uh but the the biggest
[50:13] advantage that I have is that I myself
[50:17] adopted a Bitcoin standard in in in the
[50:21] personal treasury if you if you call it
[50:23] like that I think that will be the the
[50:27] the major advantage I think I will not
[50:30] beat like the revenue counted this year
[50:34] from the podcast in Bitcoin will
[50:37] probably be more than uh in 10 years
[50:40] time I don't know maybe I'm wrong but uh
[50:43] I think it will be very hard to to to
[50:45] beat that uh Bitcoin uh Target and so
[50:49] it's really interesting when you look at
[50:52] when you create something you get value
[50:54] it really matters where you save that
[50:57] value it really matters where you put
[50:59] that uh because otherwise you're just
[51:02] like in a better hamster wheel you're
[51:04] just in a in a
[51:06] better hardworking mode and uh yeah in
[51:10] the past you had to do all with like
[51:12] real estate you had to do stocks you
[51:14] have to do all those things to be also
[51:16] good off like it wasn't it was also
[51:18] possible before Bitcoin but it required
[51:20] a lot of work and a lot of attention uh
[51:22] towards that and now it's just like
[51:25] saving Bitcoin
[51:27] and concentrate all your time in
[51:29] providing value and I love that so much
[51:31] that we are able to do that and this
[51:34] also um activated a lot in me and then
[51:37] probably also with you right yeah I I I
[51:39] think that's the thing that's that's the
[51:41] other side of it like Bitcoin it's
[51:42] potential to to to outperform pretty
[51:45] much any asset that you mentioned like
[51:47] stocks and real estate and the US dollar
[51:49] and gold is is the kind of like you know
[51:52] up and to the right way we see things
[51:54] but you mentioned something that's super
[51:55] important as well which is like what is
[51:58] the required maintenance time of holding
[52:00] Bitcoin like how much like upkeep how
[52:02] much how much time per day do me and you
[52:05] dedicate to keeping our Bitcoin like you
[52:08] know zero like I wake up it's cold
[52:11] stored like I go to sleep it's still
[52:13] there I wake up the next day and it's
[52:15] still there like the other models that
[52:18] we have are like you
[52:19] know you get a good job but it never
[52:22] pays enough and your salar is going down
[52:24] because of inflation so then you get a
[52:25] side hustle you know like everybody's
[52:27] got this gig economy so you'll have a
[52:28] Shopify and you'll sell stuff or you
[52:31] know if you're a bit more trfi you'll be
[52:33] like hey I'm going to do stocks and like
[52:35] I'll have like these platforms and these
[52:36] Bots and you delve into that or if
[52:39] you're a bit more you know like I want
[52:41] something physical bricks and water
[52:43] you'll buy a real estate but all of
[52:46] those three things whether it be a side
[52:47] hustle whether it be stocks whether it
[52:49] be like real estate you're going to have
[52:51] to fit that into your already busy week
[52:54] right so you're just committing even
[52:56] more time to assets that won't even
[52:58] perform as well as Bitcoin so at what
[53:00] point is that a good exchange of Time
[53:02] Versus future potential and future
[53:05] freedom and finance it's not like you're
[53:08] giving in the present like Bitcoin isn't
[53:12] asking much of you as an investor or a
[53:14] bitcoiner or a hodler or whatever you
[53:16] want to call
[53:17] is I think cognitively and like
[53:20] psychologically and and and in terms of
[53:22] like yeah there are some core basics of
[53:25] how to transact with Bitcoin that you
[53:26] need to master and there's some key
[53:28] Concepts economically that you need to
[53:30] understand so you you have the
[53:32] conviction to hoddle throughout the the
[53:34] drops and and not freak out when it hits
[53:37] an all-time high and you know just
[53:38] behaviorally just learning to become a
[53:40] bitcoiner but that doesn't actually take
[53:43] that long and then once that's been done
[53:46] you just sit back like it's super easy
[53:49] and with its performance and the zero
[53:53] amount of upkeep it requires it's that's
[53:56] how how it gives you a time back I think
[53:58] I think yeah that's a that's a good
[54:00] point there are two sides to being a
[54:02] Bitcoin other one is it's got huge
[54:03] potential for for growth and two it
[54:07] requires zero upkeep pretty much um you
[54:11] can be a really lazy Bitcoin or but
[54:12] still very successful and I think that's
[54:15] why
[54:17] um that's why I think we will slide in
[54:20] the singularity of Bitcoin a singularity
[54:22] of money where we only have Bitcoin
[54:25] because it will be
[54:26] so much better than anything else out
[54:29] there obviously we will still have
[54:31] companies and stocks and venture capital
[54:33] and we will have a financial Market uh
[54:35] but but they will be extremely
[54:38] demonetized and the monetary premium
[54:41] will be in Bitcoin and I hope we also
[54:44] get to a point where we don't have
[54:47] hundreds of currencies all around the
[54:49] world that are different exchange rates
[54:52] and yeah a foreign Forex market and
[54:54] stuff like that like I hope all those Fe
[54:56] things that kind of fall away and
[54:59] distract Humanity from providing value
[55:02] to each other uh and uh I hope really we
[55:06] get to a point where where this all gets
[55:08] gets away and we slide in this
[55:10] Singularity of money which is Bitcoin do
[55:12] you also see it like that that we long
[55:14] term there's no way there's like this
[55:17] Bitcoin we go through and it will all
[55:19] consolidate to towards that end boss of
[55:23] of money yeah I think the key word you
[55:26] used value you know like uh taking the
[55:29] example you used about all these
[55:30] different currencies like having worked
[55:32] in trafi like that's where these
[55:34] companies exist they they exist on the
[55:37] friction between the diversity so if you
[55:39] want to move from Australian dollars to
[55:42] Euros like there's a friction you know
[55:44] so the company jumps in there they'll
[55:45] charge you a commission and and they'll
[55:47] they'll do all of these uh these
[55:49] mechanisms or if you want to move from
[55:51] one cell phone provider to the other
[55:53] they'll charge you exit fees and if you
[55:54] want to have like some streaming
[55:56] subscription to listen to your movies
[55:58] like you'll have to have a lot of
[55:59] different ones every time there's
[56:02] diversity of those types of things where
[56:04] we lose a little bit of value in what it
[56:06] is right you know and I think finances
[56:08] is the best one like I suppose it's like
[56:10] people like strike and like like uh Jack
[56:13] males that are doing things about
[56:14] International remittances but you've got
[56:16] people uh living on different sides of
[56:18] the world that grew up in other parts
[56:20] and they're sending money from one place
[56:21] to the other that's the best example is
[56:23] like you know the Western Unions of the
[56:25] world where they exist on the
[56:27] friction and they take a huge cut and
[56:30] they make
[56:31] things they make them um they make you
[56:34] as dependent as possible like that
[56:35] friction they love it because that's why
[56:37] they can enter into the marketplace and
[56:40] and make a profit off of the friction
[56:42] and the frustration and the challenges
[56:44] of you not being able to do that but if
[56:46] you remove that friction by just having
[56:48] the singularity of Bitcoin then
[56:50] everything you don't lose the value you
[56:52] know if if I send Bitcoin from Canada
[56:55] where I am to
[56:58] Brazil it's not going to lose as much of
[57:00] its value as if I was to move Canadian
[57:04] dollars over to to yourself in Euros I'd
[57:07] lose on the spread right but Bitcoin to
[57:08] bitcoin is is pretty much frictionless
[57:11] you know there's a miner fee but you're
[57:12] supporting the
[57:14] community so you don't lose value when
[57:16] you have like single levels of protocol
[57:19] I think uh I think that's it really I
[57:21] think yeah it would help deliver like
[57:23] more consistency and and again uh
[57:25] getting the time back because we're not
[57:26] losing value on on the
[57:28] friction how do you think we we we get
[57:32] there because obviously Bitcoin is
[57:36] extremely Bitcoin has such a huge uh
[57:40] potential that it is right now really
[57:42] really small compared to what's the
[57:44] potential for Bitcoin and also not a lot
[57:46] of bit peoples are in Bitcoin compared
[57:48] to how many people could potentially be
[57:50] in Bitcoin um and I'm always really
[57:53] fascinated of like how how how are we
[57:56] starting from like this what we have
[57:58] built in the last 15 years uh to getting
[58:02] in the next like 15 20 30 50 years to to
[58:06] scale up to 8 billion people uh how do
[58:09] how do you envision that like what are
[58:11] the challenges that that that we will
[58:14] face along along the line I kind of have
[58:17] two ways of thinking about it like
[58:18] number one is there are huge
[58:21] challenges and that's that's where I
[58:24] operate at the moment and number number
[58:26] two there are very few challenges
[58:28] because Bitcoin will just continue to be
[58:30] awesome and do its thing and you know it
[58:32] has this magnetism that people will be
[58:33] drawn to it uh the way it's antifragile
[58:36] the way it plays out through Game Theory
[58:38] it'll become more and more present in
[58:39] our everyday lives um just because of
[58:42] its design so the second part is is kind
[58:45] of quite easy to just throw off saying
[58:47] like it'll just happen like it's already
[58:49] in in process and Bitcoin Tik Tok next
[58:51] block but the first part is like U is
[58:54] kind of where I want to make an impact
[58:55] about you know how we how can we uh how
[58:57] can we move things forward how can we
[58:59] help people get on board as quick as
[59:01] possible and um within that there's
[59:03] always like a couple ways of seeing
[59:05] things and there's like is Bitcoin
[59:07] adoption top down or bottom up so like
[59:10] one of one of the best pieces of news as
[59:13] far as I can remember in terms of
[59:15] Bitcoin
[59:16] adoption the biggest news was El
[59:19] Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin right you
[59:21] know a nation state took on bitcoin it
[59:23] was everybody talked about it you know
[59:25] the newspaper front page has become like
[59:27] a collector's item and buelli became
[59:30] like a you know a figure head of Bitcoin
[59:32] adoption but at the end of the day that
[59:34] was a top down
[59:36] adoption and I'm looking forward to
[59:38] seeing what it's like I'm actually
[59:39] heading out to El Salvador soon for the
[59:41] very first time and I'm going to see
[59:43] what it's like um because personally as
[59:47] as a self-titled and it might be lame
[59:50] now 3 years after it was first coined
[59:52] but as like a Bitcoin evangelist I still
[59:54] do see that Bitcoin adoption should be
[59:56] bottom up rather than top
[59:58] down um and being able to get into that
[60:02] sphere which is what I was saying about
[60:04] marching out of the Citadel and meeting
[60:06] people in the battlefield and pulling
[60:08] them out of the the melee that that is
[60:10] the mainstream culture is kind of how it
[60:13] should be happening and and that's where
[60:14] some of the challenges are right you
[60:16] know it's in and that's what I like to
[60:18] do at the moment what I'm doing is with
[60:19] my background in finance my background
[60:21] in education and my frustrations with
[60:23] both of those sectors bitcoiners gave me
[60:26] this amazing ability to understand that
[60:28] you know you can you can hack things so
[60:31] what I'm trying to do is is hack my is
[60:33] is hack Bitcoin education by finding out
[60:35] different ways we can help people
[60:36] learn because not everybody's a
[60:39] self-taught person it kind of circles
[60:41] back to everything we were just saying
[60:43] about you know the people who are
[60:44] self-taught and curious about Bitcoin
[60:46] are already in Bitcoin so we've got to
[60:48] stop thinking that everybody will
[60:49] self-learn and is curious about Bitcoin
[60:51] it's it's not the case we're already
[60:53] here right we're talking to each other
[60:54] all the time
[60:56] but um for the people who are not on
[60:59] that side of the velro well what can we
[61:00] offer them that will help Bitcoin
[61:02] adoption and that's what I'm trying to
[61:05] design at bu Bitcoin is like um I call
[61:07] it evangelization 2.0 instead of like
[61:10] telling them that macroeconomics and
[61:12] Austrian economics and like yeah but the
[61:15] white paper and like here's the code and
[61:17] this is what open source is like people
[61:18] actually need to grasp basic
[61:21] concepts through different means than
[61:24] like white papers and in-depth podcasts
[61:26] and I'm trying to make like activities
[61:28] and workshops and interaction and role
[61:30] plays and games and you know all of
[61:32] those teacher tools that that we use in
[61:34] the traditional educational system to
[61:36] help help people understand complex
[61:38] things we should be rolling those tools
[61:40] out across Bitcoin um so that's kind of
[61:43] the way that I see Bitcoin education
[61:45] looking like and adoption going um it's
[61:49] you know I still believe that you know
[61:50] political lobbying and hoping that you
[61:52] know more and more higher ups adopt
[61:55] Bitcoin companies bring it onto their
[61:57] balance sheets and politicians bring it
[61:59] onto the onto the political
[62:02] debate onto the political debates but um
[62:05] I I'm not in that I'm not a CEO of a
[62:07] huge company um I sit here at 6: a.m.
[62:11] and editing the podcast and I just
[62:14] realized I cannot really because in this
[62:16] podcast the internet and VPN and things
[62:20] like that and his camera fall out
[62:23] multiple times and we had to restart the
[62:25] recording and this was the last time
[62:27] where it actually fell out uh and the
[62:30] previous times the the uh the overlays
[62:32] were okay and now I was like yeah they
[62:35] cut this so hard and we did not start
[62:37] the conversation where we ended it so I
[62:39] wanted to just uh
[62:41] clarify uh that that yeah we we had
[62:44] technical problems but I still wanted to
[62:46] have the last part of the conversation
[62:48] also in uh because I think it's
[62:50] interesting and that's why I'm here
[62:52] editing in my uh gym clothes and just
[62:56] wanted to record this quick video so you
[62:58] know uh where you are thank you so much
[63:00] for watching thank you so much for
[63:01] watching that far already I really
[63:03] appreciate that and if you haven't done
[63:05] so uh please subscribe it really helps
[63:07] me out to find bigger guests to find
[63:09] more guests and to hopefully orange peel
[63:11] the world a little bit more thank you so
[63:13] much and it's recording perfect fine
[63:16] very good cool man yeah this is going to
[63:19] cause you a few headaches and post but
[63:21] I'm sure this isn't the first time you
[63:22] have to do with stuff like this no uh
[63:24] you are my yeah you're my
[63:27] 299th podcast so like tomorrow I have my
[63:30] 300th
[63:32] congratulations yeah that's wild that's
[63:33] a lot of time in uh how long how how
[63:36] many uh how many months and years is
[63:38] that when did you first start uh I
[63:41] started uh 28th of November last year so
[63:45] it's like 11 months now man you've been
[63:47] doing a lot of
[63:48] podcasts yeah I do it now I do it daily
[63:52] uh I started with like once a week then
[63:54] twice a week and three times a week I I
[63:57] was like the the short story of that is
[63:59] like I just put out like the calendar
[64:00] link that you also got uh and I was
[64:03] coming from sales so I was like oh I
[64:05] will just message 50 people and maybe
[64:09] free come on my podcast but I messaged
[64:11] 50 people and like 45 people came on my
[64:15] podcast that's man that that that that
[64:18] was kind of like my mistake in the
[64:20] beginning and then I had like this queue
[64:23] of people that I have to interview and I
[64:24] still had like a full-time job uh but I
[64:27] was like yeah let's let's stick to it
[64:28] let's do it let's let's hustle uh and
[64:31] then I had like two months in advance
[64:33] recordings and I was like that's that's
[64:35] like weird like I I record now and say
[64:38] like yeah I will publish it in two
[64:40] months that's that seems to be very fine
[64:42] in the future and then I was like just
[64:44] moving up the the the weekly uploads to
[64:48] yeah basically then in the end every day
[64:51] and I still have like two weeks worth of
[64:53] recordings now and uh some even do two
[64:56] recordings per day so it's fascinating
[64:58] how many people there are in Bitcoin
[65:00] that are willing to talk on a podcast I
[65:02] thought I will run out of people but I
[65:05] barely scratched the surface I feel like
[65:08] no I mean you can you can talk with
[65:10] everybody on the on the bu bit Bitcoin
[65:12] team pretty much everybody's very
[65:14] uh I think like podcasts it's nice to
[65:17] get the time to sit down and and have
[65:19] the long format conversation this is
[65:21] like uh like for example with like
[65:23] Donald Trump who sat down with Joe Rogan
[65:25] the other day
[65:26] um I listened to like the whole three
[65:28] hours and I was like wow it took took a
[65:29] bit of effort to listen to the whole
[65:31] three hours but at the same time like
[65:33] the subjects that come up and the way
[65:35] that the conversation flows and the
[65:37] things that you can kind of reach
[65:39] together throughout conversation is much
[65:41] more natural to how we used to engage
[65:44] you know we used to sit down for an
[65:45] evening over food and discuss things now
[65:47] we're all over the world so we we do
[65:49] podcasts but I think the result is the
[65:51] same in terms of like the processing of
[65:53] ideas and the sharing of experiences and
[65:57] so so I think that's why a lot of
[65:59] bitcoiners are very willing to join your
[66:01] Bitcoin podcast as well is because it it
[66:04] helps everybody you know like I I love
[66:07] talking about Bitcoin and like some of
[66:09] the the questions make you think
[66:11] differently and at the end of it you
[66:13] level up like I feel that both people
[66:15] like guest and host after a podcast do
[66:17] level up rather than like a five minute
[66:20] interview on Fox News like in between
[66:22] two like articles you don't have time to
[66:25] to connect so yeah I can understand why
[66:29] there's a lot of people want to be on
[66:30] the podcast absolutely yeah it just
[66:32] strued me that so many people were want
[66:34] to be wanted to be on a podcast before
[66:37] there was even like a podcast like I
[66:39] literally like there was none podcast
[66:41] existent I just had like a small like 6K
[66:44] uh Twitter following and I was like okay
[66:46] like it's it's some following so uh
[66:48] people know I'm actually a bitcoiner I'm
[66:50] not like some [ __ ] coiner I'm not a
[66:52] scammer like they they kind of knew like
[66:55] I was
[66:56] in the space from my Twitter history but
[66:59] still like it was a non-existing Bitcoin
[67:01] podcast and and Jeff bu was the biggest
[67:04] surprise he really gets on every small
[67:06] podcast he is so humble uh like he like
[67:09] he really doesn't have to do that uh but
[67:13] he really wants to do that and he does
[67:15] that to promote smaller people uh
[67:18] smaller podcasters also and it's it's
[67:20] it's h I think I like I'm surprised with
[67:23] the humbleness and the kindness of the
[67:25] the Bitcoin Community to be honest that
[67:27] that completely shocked me and learned
[67:29] about the Bitcoin Community how humble
[67:31] and kind uh every everyone is in in in
[67:35] here yeah I think that's a nice thing
[67:37] that you find once you do take that move
[67:38] to surround yourself with bitcoiners is
[67:40] like uh you know we always say like um
[67:43] like don't trust verify was like a core
[67:46] belief in in Bitcoin and still is in
[67:48] terms of the protocol and like securing
[67:50] stuff and your devices but then when you
[67:52] start hanging out with Bitcoin as on a
[67:54] social level like these are some of the
[67:56] people that I would trust the most
[67:57] because you know the base protocols have
[68:00] already been established when I show up
[68:01] to an event for example and I've never
[68:03] really met people in real life but uh we
[68:05] know each other it really doesn't take
[68:07] long to become like like friends with
[68:09] people because there's a lot of stuff
[68:11] that's been done separately and you can
[68:13] connect a lot quicker and and some
[68:16] people that I know through Bitcoin now I
[68:17] I trust way much more than if we were
[68:19] just colleagues or friends or neighbors
[68:21] it's because we're bitcoiners like
[68:22] that's that's something that's really
[68:24] cool about
[68:26] I hate the word Community because
[68:27] everybody over uses the word Community
[68:29] but um but it is part of like that that
[68:32] sense of belonging like opens people up
[68:34] like oh right okay let's let's share
[68:35] more let's collaborate more let's uh
[68:37] let's help each other more because uh
[68:40] you know we're all in it together I
[68:42] suppose it is a movement without it
[68:44] sounding like a a sect or anything but
[68:46] uh you know there is a part of like the
[68:48] movement that we all help each other
[68:50] out absolutely yeah and I had uh a
[68:54] discussion with people who actually we
[68:56] in sects like like actual sects and they
[68:59] said like yeah I get where people
[69:01] compare it but if you were actually once
[69:04] in a SE it's nothing like that Bitcoin
[69:07] Community is such a open welcoming
[69:10] non-toxic Community I mean we we kind of
[69:13] seem toxic when you just look at
[69:15] Twitter but but that's not a
[69:17] representation of the actual Bitcoin
[69:19] Community go out there on a Bitcoin
[69:20] conference uh uh watch some Bitcoin
[69:23] podcast that's more the CRA of what
[69:25] Bitcoin Community actually is I feel
[69:27] like on Twitter and social media on like
[69:29] this short form especially text form uh
[69:32] we we came across way more toxic but
[69:34] it's such a yeah nice Community as you
[69:37] as you said and yeah completely
[69:39] overlooked the time we are actually
[69:41] quite Advanced already
[69:44] um one question that I ask all my guests
[69:47] is what can we learn from you besides
[69:49] Bitcoin and that's actually uh kind of
[69:52] closing the loop to one of the uh first
[69:55] topics that we discussed having identity
[69:57] outside of of Bitcoin um so we talked a
[70:00] little bit about it but is there
[70:02] something that uh you really want to
[70:04] share outside of Bitcoin uh about you or
[70:06] a skill or whatever like you can go in
[70:09] any direction yeah I I think that is um
[70:12] maybe the reason why I am in Bitcoin is
[70:14] because I it's kind of funny I don't
[70:16] want to be in Bitcoin but I I I know I
[70:19] need to go through Bitcoin to get to
[70:22] where I want to go which which is uh I
[70:24] always see myself as an educator first
[70:26] and a Bitcoin a second and it is
[70:28] something that you know that's that's my
[70:29] final like when we won that's where I'll
[70:32] be going I know where I want to go
[70:34] already which is which is back into
[70:36] education and uh that kind of vision
[70:38] also fits in with bull bitcoin's kind of
[70:40] vision like we we exist as an exchange
[70:43] so that eventually one day we won't be
[70:45] relevant you know we we work so we'll
[70:48] eventually no longer exist because if we
[70:50] no longer exist it means people don't
[70:52] need to exchange Fiat for Bitcoin they
[70:54] just have Bitcoin so when a Bitcoin
[70:56] standard exists The Exchange doesn't
[70:58] need to stay open so it kind of kind of
[71:01] fits with where I uh where I place
[71:04] myself with bull Bitcoin as well like
[71:06] we're all working towards eventually
[71:07] being able to hang up the uh the the
[71:10] bull Bitcoin uh well the the kind of
[71:13] Bitcoin uh uniform and then going about
[71:15] doing what we really always wanted to do
[71:18] but um we're here this is the
[71:20] battlefield you know we have the Citadel
[71:22] where we go and rest between each uh
[71:24] each podcast and each event and each
[71:25] Meetup uh we talk between ourselves over
[71:28] Twitter and stuff but uh we always March
[71:30] out onto the battlefield but eventually
[71:32] the battle will be one and then we can
[71:34] uh we can move on to other things so for
[71:36] me it's always education I always like
[71:38] the way of like I think the human brain
[71:39] is wonderful and being able to
[71:42] understand it and find new ways of pre
[71:43] presenting information so that people
[71:45] understand it that type of connection is
[71:46] something that's magic to me I always
[71:48] like the UA moment um in education and
[71:51] if you can be the person who helps hand
[71:53] that Eureka moment over to somebody
[71:55] it's like uh it's everything to me so I
[71:59] I I found that there's so much things
[72:01] people don't know about Bitcoin that I
[72:02] can deliver those Eureka moments but
[72:04] eventually when everybody's learned
[72:05] Bitcoin and everybody gets it or they
[72:07] don't even need to get it it just exists
[72:09] um I I'll go on to other things and and
[72:12] help help hand over those Eureka moments
[72:14] again and again again because it's
[72:15] something I really live for uh that's
[72:18] that's extremely uh beautiful i l it a
[72:21] lot really really cool um perfect then
[72:23] let's come to the end routine of the
[72:24] podcast where the previous guest is
[72:26] asking a question for the next guest
[72:27] without knowing who the next guest
[72:28] actually is um and I honestly I usually
[72:32] have an answer for the questions that I
[72:34] get for my next guest but I wouldn't
[72:37] have an answer for that question but
[72:39] maybe you have one um is scarcity a fund
[72:43] fundamental feature of Bitcoin or is it
[72:46] a consequence of bitcoin's fundamental
[72:49] features I think it's fundamental the
[72:51] scarcity thing because I think one of
[72:54] the a moment for me um was when I was
[72:57] talking with Francis about like some
[72:59] some work we were we were we were
[73:01] putting together and he's like I think
[73:03] you're missing the key point and I was
[73:04] like what is it he was like well because
[73:06] on the supply and demand curve like
[73:09] Bitcoin is the first ever economic asset
[73:12] where you can't increase the supply like
[73:14] that's how that's what makes it so
[73:16] robust and you know like you know
[73:19] everything we've used in the past like
[73:21] uh you know Fiat but pre Fiat like gold
[73:23] and and diamonds like
[73:25] even though these things are scarce to
[73:28] some degree you can increase
[73:30] Supply you can go and mine more you can
[73:33] even fake diamonds nowadays by
[73:35] synthesizing them so you know you can
[73:37] flood markets it might take a while but
[73:39] you can flood markets if the demand's
[73:41] High Enough by increasing Supply but
[73:43] Bitcoin doesn't ever increase the supply
[73:46] and that's the thing that we agree on
[73:47] that's the 21 million you know or
[73:48] Infinity divided by 21
[73:51] million so I think it's part of its
[73:53] design and I think it's what's
[73:54] fundamental to it and it's it's scarce
[73:56] in a unique way as well it's not that it
[73:58] has scarcity it's that its scarcity is
[74:03] its beauty its scarcity is its
[74:05] uniqueness and the the type of scarcity
[74:08] it has hasn't existed before um so I
[74:11] think it's fundamental and I think it's
[74:13] a core design even when you look at it
[74:15] in other ways it helps you to explain
[74:16] the volatility of Bitcoin like when
[74:18] you're you know sometimes people like
[74:20] yeah but Bitcoin is really volatile it's
[74:22] like it is volatile but it's a feature
[74:25] not a bug because of the scarcity right
[74:27] you know usually if you have a different
[74:29] Market that's and they go through
[74:31] volatility well they can smooth
[74:32] volatility byre increasing Supply um but
[74:35] you can't increase Supply on bitcoin so
[74:37] it does play into its volatility it
[74:39] doesn't help smooth volatility but it's
[74:42] uh like I said it's it's a feature not a
[74:44] bug because in the long term you don't
[74:45] want to debase assets for the sake of
[74:48] short-term volatility smoothing you want
[74:51] long-term growth so it's built on that
[74:54] scarcity so I think I think it's it's a
[74:55] it's a core thing that 21 million is
[74:57] like right a die you know so I love it
[75:01] yeah that's I love that too really
[75:02] really cool um that was a beautiful one
[75:05] also really cool thank you so much uh
