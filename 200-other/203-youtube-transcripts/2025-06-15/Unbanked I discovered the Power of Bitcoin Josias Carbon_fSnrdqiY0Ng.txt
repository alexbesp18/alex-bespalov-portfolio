[00:00] the whole system is corrupt they've
[00:01] shown their true colors I was unbanked
[00:03] by a bank I banked with for since I was
[00:05] 10 years old it went on for a 12 week
[00:07] period where I literally couldn't access
[00:09] any money I threatened two things I said
[00:12] I'm either going to go into the store
[00:14] with a baseball bat or I'm going to step
[00:15] out in front of a lorry because you guys
[00:17] give me no choice the whole system needs
[00:19] to be burnt to the ground and we're not
[00:21] physically going to burn it to the
[00:22] ground so we're going to create a
[00:23] parallel system with the market is going
[00:24] to decide who the winner is and I
[00:26] believe Bitcoin is the
[00:27] winner I think uh I never covered the
[00:30] topic on on my podcast about sports and
[00:32] Bitcoin so I was like you're the perfect
[00:34] man for for doing that uh and you're
[00:37] also like on bitcoin conferences in
[00:38] madira I think you were also on stage I
[00:41] think uh so this was really really
[00:44] cool yeah yeah well first of all thank
[00:46] you for inviting me on um yes I was up
[00:49] with daa recently I had a a side um talk
[00:53] it's part of the educational um event
[00:56] that they had there we also did some uh
[00:58] satellite events with football or soccer
[01:00] some people we call it so we had the
[01:02] Bitcoin Atlantis football cup I did some
[01:04] skills training sessions with the young
[01:06] children that were at the festival so
[01:07] yeah it was really good and um and then
[01:10] upcoming next week shout out to the
[01:12] Bitcoin Fest in the UK it's going to be
[01:14] H at Carter NFC and notam another
[01:17] Bitcoin football team taking on the
[01:19] Bitcoin standard holding a festival
[01:21] before the game on next Saturday for
[01:23] people to come and learn discuss Bitcoin
[01:25] and and watch some football afterwards
[01:27] so there's a lot lots of synergies
[01:28] between football and Bitcoin lot with
[01:32] other other passions that people have um
[01:35] with the sport but also with creative
[01:37] creative skill that people have you can
[01:39] align Bitcoin with it really cool and
[01:42] what are those synergies like what are
[01:43] the connections of of sports football
[01:46] and and Bitcoin how does Bitcoin
[01:48] influence in the future also Sports and
[01:51] and football how do you imagine that
[01:53] yeah well ultim ultimately it's about
[01:55] proof of work so how you perform on the
[01:59] pitch on the field or whatever sport
[02:01] you're doing the results that you get
[02:04] are going to be directly correlated with
[02:05] with the work that you put in so if
[02:06] you're not training if not doing your
[02:08] own research and not doing your due
[02:09] diligence then your performance will
[02:11] show so those that are out week and week
[02:13] out performing showing that they are the
[02:15] best of the best they've put in the work
[02:17] outside of outside of the field on the
[02:20] training ground and it it show them the
[02:26] pitch amazing I just uh pled my Earp
[02:29] pods in so I think now I can hear you
[02:31] better sorry for that okay thought
[02:34] thought a
[02:35] l perfect then this is really cool I see
[02:39] a lot of uh bitcoiners uh doing the
[02:42] proof of work doing the training doing
[02:44] the fitness stuff uh it's like
[02:46] interesting for me if you go to bitcoin
[02:48] conferences obviously there are also
[02:50] people that don't work out there's
[02:51] obviously people uh uh that that are on
[02:54] their journey to becoming fitter uh but
[02:57] in general Bitcoin is a pretty uh fit if
[03:00] you go to bitcoin conferences you go to
[03:02] bitcoin meetups you're like you're
[03:03] seeing usually pretty healthy people
[03:06] because they fix their money and then
[03:08] this influences kind of their lives how
[03:10] do you see this uh uh connection going
[03:13] and did you have the same experience
[03:15] like did Bitcoin com into your life
[03:17] after you you're fit probably
[03:20] right yeah so I I've been on a journey
[03:23] of rabbit holes and like many people
[03:26] dismissed Bitcoin um had various touch
[03:29] points for but didn't really have time
[03:31] to look into it or understand it I went
[03:33] on a rabbit hole journey through health
[03:35] and wellness back in
[03:37] 2018 and funly enough so my former life
[03:40] I was a construction project manager and
[03:42] as I started to look into health and
[03:44] wellness and fitness my site manager
[03:46] asked me one day can I bring in my GPU
[03:49] into the office I went yeah that's fine
[03:50] just keep him happy and I came one day
[03:53] and he told me he was mining Bitcoin and
[03:54] I totally dismissed it so the reason why
[03:57] I'm so passionate about talking about
[03:58] Bitcoin now is cuz I feel like I want to
[04:00] be the person I thought I should have
[04:01] had at the time but also I want to
[04:04] encourage people to be inquisitive to to
[04:08] ask questions because I didn't ask any
[04:09] questions about why he was minding
[04:11] Bitcoin and what it was I'd seen it on
[04:13] the news a little bit but didn't really
[04:16] have again have time to look into it but
[04:18] yeah during that that journey of Health
[04:19] and Wellness I'd learned about fighting
[04:23] the fud self belief I learned about
[04:24] delay gratification um that then led me
[04:27] to an position when Co happened
[04:30] uh to make the decision to leave my job
[04:32] as a construction project manager I
[04:34] didn't feel happy I wasn't happy didn't
[04:36] feel fulfilled I didn't feel like I'd
[04:38] providing value um at all yes I was
[04:40] completing projects um on time the
[04:43] clients were happy but for me like what
[04:45] am I provide into the world so yeah when
[04:47] Co came around I took
[04:51] redundancy um I then started to FOC from
[04:53] wellness and at that time A friend of
[04:56] mine said to me who wants to discuss
[04:58] crypto or in in a friends group trat and
[05:00] I said yeah hey why not I have the time
[05:02] to do it the first thing he said that
[05:04] I'll never forget was uh do your own
[05:06] research so I did a month Deep dive and
[05:08] because I had the free time spent about
[05:10] 8 to 10 hours a day of listening reading
[05:12] watching YouTube by the end of the month
[05:15] I was like whoa this is it this this is
[05:17] what I want to learn more about um and
[05:20] I've been on a a deep dive Rabbit Hole
[05:23] Journey since as you you all appreciate
[05:25] so three and a half years um coming up
[05:28] to my first full cycle I say to people
[05:31] now if I was doing a degree I'll be
[05:33] doing my Master's year so it's funny
[05:36] because if you were doing a degree and
[05:38] your Masters people would say you're
[05:39] well educated I appreciate that people
[05:42] in the space uh we are probably in the
[05:44] 1% of the of the population with our
[05:46] knowledge but there's still so much that
[05:48] I don't know and don't understand that
[05:49] I'm really excited to learn about so
[05:51] it's a it's an ongoing evolution of my
[05:53] sou of Coach carbon uh last week was H
[05:58] was was four years where I decided that
[06:01] I'm going to be a coach and try to make
[06:03] the world a better place make people
[06:05] healthier and happier I now
[06:08] understanding how money Works through
[06:10] health wealth and lifestyle coaching
[06:12] that's my mission to to make the world
[06:14] healthier wealthier and happier one
[06:16] person at a time if we can all each one
[06:18] Each one teach one it's a mission that
[06:20] that's worthwhile it's not going to
[06:22] happen probably In Our Lifetime um it
[06:24] might take a generation or two but if we
[06:26] all if we're all learning and bettering
[06:28] ourselves and helping others do the same
[06:31] it's going to make the world a better
[06:32] place so yeah I found the health and
[06:35] wellness first but then that primed me
[06:37] for Bitcoin and as you say people that
[06:40] understand Bitcoin then discuss time
[06:42] preference delay
[06:44] gratification understanding your
[06:46] yourself better mind and body so it's a
[06:48] whole encompassing of becoming the best
[06:50] the best version of yourself that's
[06:52] amazing and and what do like uh I see a
[06:54] lot of people getting more in health and
[06:57] wellness I think we're progressing as a
[06:59] society in general especially with so
[07:01] much information out there and it's it's
[07:03] it's getting easy and easier to do that
[07:06] but at the same time we have really big
[07:09] comparations doing uh a lot of sugar a
[07:13] lot of processed foods a lot of stuff
[07:15] and people are lazy just going to
[07:17] McDonald's and stuff like that so like I
[07:18] see see like two Trends going out people
[07:21] that are uh doing the research doing the
[07:24] uh the harder stuff and actually doing
[07:26] their own work and as you do did your
[07:28] own research but also the people that
[07:30] are just like on autopilot going to
[07:32] McDonald's St to all the stuff and and
[07:35] just eating what they trying figure out
[07:37] what ah Supermarket just take this this
[07:39] this this and just do something uh which
[07:42] is not completely bad but it's just not
[07:45] unaware of of what your potential could
[07:47] be I think uh so how do you see uh like
[07:52] health and wellness going like what what
[07:54] do you usually recommend people like
[07:56] because I think it's it's it's it's
[07:58] pretty not good to just give them like
[08:00] this you should do is better to like
[08:03] push them towards the direction and then
[08:05] get them on a journey like what how do
[08:07] you do that it it definitely goes hand
[08:09] inand um health and wealth so it's never
[08:12] been easier to learn about your health
[08:15] and to learn about wealth but the easy
[08:18] option is to let the state do it for you
[08:22] so listening to the the food pyramid
[08:24] that that state give you it's not going
[08:26] to make you healthier uh with with your
[08:28] money oh yes you can just use our fear
[08:31] or use our cbdt that's coming that's
[08:33] easy that's the easy option it's harder
[08:36] to actually say actually I'm going to do
[08:37] my research I'm going to find out what
[08:39] lifestyle is like for me in terms of
[08:41] nutrition um in terms of my money how
[08:43] can I make my money work for me going
[08:45] down that rabbit hole you might start
[08:47] looking at stocks and shares and then
[08:49] actually seeing that's how manipulated
[08:51] well what what is the definition of
[08:52] money and that will lead you to bitcoin
[08:54] and understand that Bitcoin is the best
[08:55] form of of money that we've ever had
[08:57] that takes work but once you've done the
[09:00] work it's easy or as say this
[09:03] says just DCA you buy a little and often
[09:07] just have one basket and watch that
[09:08] basket very carefully so you don't need
[09:10] to diversify and myself and many other
[09:13] Bitcoin plebs around the world
[09:15] outperforming all these money managers
[09:18] asset managers just by
[09:20] DCA it's so easy but you have to do the
[09:22] work to get there and it's same with
[09:24] your with your your health and wellness
[09:26] it's easy sorry it's never been easier
[09:28] to find out information information out
[09:30] there YouTube books but you have to
[09:33] obviously do your own research find out
[09:35] what works for you and do it
[09:36] consistently day in day out and now I'm
[09:38] not saying you have to be a monk and not
[09:40] have any say Pleasures you are allowed
[09:44] to have the the food and drink that not
[09:47] the best for you because we are are
[09:49] allowed to live but if you have a
[09:51] consistent lifestyle continuously week
[09:54] after week month after month year after
[09:56] year it's going to take time but then
[09:57] you get to a position where
[10:01] yeah you're becoming the best version of
[10:02] yourself and it's easy easy to maintain
[10:04] once you have those habits in
[10:06] place interesting this is there anything
[10:10] that was coming up on your journey in
[10:12] Bitcoin that you learned about finances
[10:15] outside of Bitcoin like personal finance
[10:18] habits stuff like did of course DCA is
[10:21] the obvious one but did you learn
[10:22] anything above that with budgeting
[10:24] anything like that I've learned so much
[10:28] I thought I knew money before um I was
[10:31] into stocks and shares I I had I had
[10:33] small Holdings but the more I learned
[10:35] about Bitcoin the more I learned about e
[10:37] economics Austrian economics things I
[10:40] talk about discuss now for the four
[10:42] years ago me would look back and look at
[10:43] myself in the future think who is this
[10:45] guy but it's a quest it's a quest for
[10:47] knowledge I I love learning about all of
[10:49] this stuff and there's been lots of
[10:52] touch turn turning points in my journey
[10:54] um that have happened because of Bitcoin
[10:57] but if I hadn't understood Bitcoin I
[10:58] wouldn't really know where ago so um
[11:01] long story sure I was unbanked by a bank
[11:03] I banked with for since I was 10 years
[11:06] old um just for the fact that I
[11:09] interacted tried to interact with
[11:10] Bitcoin um as it happened it went on for
[11:13] a 12we period where I literally couldn't
[11:16] access any money but because obviously
[11:19] I've been down myall journey I
[11:21] understood Bitcoin I was able to survive
[11:23] but the bank didn't know that so I was I
[11:26] was prepared for what happened but in my
[11:29] back on mind I think I was thought I
[11:30] need to learn more about Bitcoin and
[11:32] tell people because someone else could
[11:34] end up in this situation and not know
[11:36] what to do and not know where to turn it
[11:37] could be life ending for them um and
[11:40] that's
[11:41] how i' I managed to resolve the issue
[11:44] because it was just dragging on dragging
[11:46] on again I mentioned I had free time so
[11:48] I could go to the bank and sit there for
[11:50] three hours people on the front line the
[11:52] nicest people in the world but they're
[11:54] not the decision makers it was literally
[11:55] them on the computer sorry so computer
[11:57] says no day in Day Out but it got to the
[12:00] point where I thought you guys are
[12:01] absolutely taking the mick now we need
[12:03] to sort this out um I'm not recommending
[12:05] this to people but I threatened two
[12:07] things to on the phone to one of the
[12:10] fraud team I said I'm either going to go
[12:13] into the store with a baseball bat or
[12:15] I'm going to step out in front of a
[12:16] lorry because you guys give me no choice
[12:19] within 10 minutes the issue was resolved
[12:21] please sir come into the bank to to
[12:23] remove your funds you were we no longer
[12:25] want you to back with us but the issue
[12:26] is resolved it's like this has gone off
[12:28] for 12 weeks you could done this ages
[12:29] ago but until they see like a need
[12:32] because they don't want on the front of
[12:34] a newspaper uh a father um a husband
[12:37] sorry with two children two young
[12:39] children took his own life or went in
[12:41] and smashed up a bank because we
[12:42] couldn't give him his money they didn't
[12:43] want that publicity it's like yeah the
[12:45] whole system is corrupt they've shown
[12:47] their true colors the fact that they
[12:49] have shown their hand to me personally
[12:52] but also to the world in terms of what
[12:54] happened dur covid we saw what happened
[12:56] with the game Street Saga what's going
[12:58] on now SBF the fact that he only got 25
[13:02] years in prison but you get Ross orri
[13:04] still prison Ser two life sentences like
[13:06] now the the whole system without sound
[13:09] sounding too radical and anarchistic
[13:11] needs to be burnt to the ground and
[13:13] we're not physically going to burn it to
[13:15] the ground so we're going to create a
[13:16] parallel system and like true true
[13:19] markets with the market is going to
[13:21] decide who the winner is and I believe
[13:22] Bitcoin is the winner saying the says
[13:24] there is no second best and we have the
[13:27] best people that the best Minds bringing
[13:30] our best the other side don't seem to be
[13:33] sending their best and I I question why
[13:35] maybe they have ultimate boss that we
[13:38] need to defeat at the end but I think
[13:39] that we are becoming antifragile and we
[13:42] will assume be ready for that ultimate
[13:43] boss whether it is in in terms of a
[13:46] major cbdc or all the governments coming
[13:49] coming together but I can't see all the
[13:51] governments coming together as one so
[13:54] you talk about incentive structures if
[13:56] they can't beat us they're going to have
[13:57] to join us you have Salvador now' be
[14:00] Kelly flying the flag who's going to be
[14:02] the next one it's in their interest to
[14:05] join us rather than fight it so it might
[14:07] be a slow slow battle slow War but I
[14:10] think we will win ultimately well
[14:13] there's a lot in there what you just
[14:14] said
[14:16] uh sorry that was really really cool um
[14:20] before like ju just to give some
[14:22] background to the story where was this
[14:24] Bank when was this uh just for people
[14:27] that can I I wait name them but i' call
[14:30] them shle Bank they're a wellknown bank
[14:33] worldwide um but I think they have
[14:35] improved apparently on Twitter they have
[14:38] a someone told me they have a DED
[14:40] dedicated crypto fraud team now that are
[14:42] very helpful which unfortunately didn't
[14:44] help me a few years ago but it seems
[14:46] like they are again they are learning
[14:48] they are changing their methods so Sim
[14:51] had an issue in the Bitcoin space and he
[14:53] said it was resolved within a couple of
[14:54] hours rather than 12 weeks so yeah they
[14:57] have improved
[14:59] it's it's it's amazing for me that this
[15:01] happens I mean I uh tried to get a loan
[15:04] uh once because I just wanted to try it
[15:06] out because I heard it's really hard to
[15:08] get a loan when you're a bitcoiner and I
[15:10] was like okay let's let's try it out I I
[15:11] did not need a loan I was just getting a
[15:13] loan for for fun basically uh I just
[15:16] wanted to try it out and I went to 20
[15:19] different uh
[15:21] Banks and the 20 gave me one I was like
[15:25] yes I succeeded but it was taking taking
[15:27] me like okay it took me eight months
[15:29] obviously I could do it in a short
[15:31] amount but I did not had stress I just
[15:33] wanted to try it out so like I was not
[15:35] depending on the money so I was like
[15:37] let's try it out but in the end of the
[15:40] day I got it uh and it's it was
[15:42] interesting but every bank before was
[15:44] like we we see some uh unusual
[15:48] activities on your bank account I was
[15:50] like what's unusual what what do I buy
[15:52] that's unusual what what what's
[15:53] happening did I got scammed or something
[15:55] like no there's this you you you
[15:58] invested Bitcoin right it's like what
[16:00] the and how cautious they
[16:04] like yeah well it's the unknown is it
[16:06] they they don't know what it is so
[16:08] they're scared of it we've done our
[16:10] research we we understand it a lot more
[16:12] than them um so yeah that's I think
[16:16] that's difference they haven't spent the
[16:17] time but there are those within the
[16:19] space though I say the Fiat world that
[16:21] maybe have spent the time but know it's
[16:24] not in their interest for Bitcoin to
[16:25] work so those that speak Illy of it
[16:28] either are ignorant have work all they
[16:30] they have alterior mes yeah definitely
[16:33] and it's it's it's fascinating because
[16:35] if you have uh if if you come with a
[16:38] bank statement there and you can barely
[16:39] make it with the bank statement uh and
[16:42] you say oh I want to go on a two weeks
[16:45] holidays please give me 5,000 they
[16:47] probably give it to you f if you have a
[16:50] good balance sheet a good bank statement
[16:53] with a few Bitcoin transaction with it
[16:55] no no no no no that's too risky that we
[16:57] cannot give you're not you're not
[16:59] attractive to them you're a Savvy
[17:02] investor uh which leads me to the next
[17:06] uh topic um when when we have this
[17:08] Bitcoin and you talk about how Bitcoin
[17:10] like influenced your life and how
[17:12] Bitcoin can influence other lives how
[17:15] where do we go like where where's the
[17:17] society ending up in like 50 hundred
[17:19] years when Bitcoin is a standard like do
[17:21] you see changes on a broader scale on
[17:24] society yeah without sounding too
[17:27] optimistic I believe we have that the
[17:30] Renaissance As Stacy Herbert and Max
[17:31] Kaiser talk about we've seen what's
[17:33] happening in Al Salvador what we looking
[17:35] at just over two years of Bitcoin
[17:38] Bitcoin is legal tender and it's not
[17:40] just a fact that Bitcoin is legal tender
[17:42] that has caused a change but it allows
[17:45] people to come and invest it opens up
[17:48] for investment people then want to them
[17:50] visit and spend money people on on the
[17:52] island then are accepting uh Bitcoin
[17:55] they're seeing how it works how it works
[17:57] as a unit of account as a store of value
[17:59] mindsets change already they've seen a
[18:01] change in their GDP um the approval rate
[18:05] of B has gone up because they've seen
[18:06] change in in their their society and
[18:08] safety so the safety of the country has
[18:10] gone up that is just a small example um
[18:13] you can look at individuals in the
[18:15] Bitcoin space that have changed their
[18:16] Lifestyles who created businesses but
[18:19] again you are incentivized to deliver
[18:21] value and be the best version if you
[18:24] don't the community or the network will
[18:26] will will soon ostracize will push you
[18:28] out because you're not providing value
[18:30] so it changes people's mindset and if
[18:33] you look on on a m micro scale you can
[18:35] see the change so we open out and think
[18:38] okay we've had coming up to the fourth
[18:40] cycle in two three more Cycles we're
[18:43] just going to add more people to the
[18:44] network more people bringing their best
[18:46] more value being created it has that
[18:49] Network effect of of creating the world
[18:51] making the world a better place I
[18:53] believe um it's not just me that thinks
[18:55] that now many others people have written
[18:57] books about it they've been on podcast
[18:58] so don't just listen to me look into
[19:01] Bitcoin see what you can offer as value
[19:04] with with your skills with your
[19:06] creativity um just Just Go With It Go
[19:09] learn about it for just leave at least
[19:11] one cycle uh people talk about doing 100
[19:13] hours of research of Bitcoin and and not
[19:16] being an as being positive bullish about
[19:18] it I would argue the same do your 100
[19:20] hours of of research go through one
[19:22] cycle and see how you feel afterwards
[19:25] and I think this this hours even come
[19:27] down a little bit with with time when
[19:30] you were in like 2015 you needed a lot
[19:33] more hours to actually understand it
[19:34] because information was so hard to find
[19:37] nowadays there's so many great uh
[19:39] Educators in the space where you can go
[19:41] there you can listen to videos listen to
[19:44] podcasts you can uh read books you can
[19:46] do so many different stuffs in in
[19:48] Bitcoin to get educated so I nobody has
[19:51] any excuse not to get
[19:52] educated exactly there is no excuse if
[19:57] if you don't get Bitcoin you either lazy
[19:59] or
[20:00] arrogant one of those two things mostly
[20:04] it's a mix of both of them how do you
[20:06] see actually um adoption growing like
[20:10] you were in did you were in El Salvador
[20:13] already did you saw the adoption there
[20:14] no I haven't been I would love to go I
[20:17] do plan to go this year um later on of
[20:19] the year but um yeah adoption for me
[20:23] it's going to just be ease of use um
[20:25] there are many bitcoiners who
[20:28] have been in the space longer than me
[20:30] who are me that don't really understand
[20:32] use cases of lightning for me Lightning
[20:34] has always been around in the space
[20:36] since since I started learning about it
[20:38] so I just see that as as a natural
[20:40] natural step in four years time there
[20:42] are people there are people that will
[20:43] join the space that will probably look
[20:44] at stuff I'm doing think that's so old
[20:46] and dated this is what we're doing now
[20:47] so just adoption ease of use if you got
[20:50] a mobile phone that can scan a QR code
[20:52] you can use Bitcoin people are already
[20:54] using their phone for payments so that
[20:57] is not a massive step for them to take
[20:59] before if you were trying to do a
[21:01] transaction on chain and waiting 10
[21:02] minutes that might be a bit alien to
[21:04] some people who are used to instant
[21:06] transactions now we have lightning we
[21:08] have the Len URLs the like email address
[21:11] that you can pay you can scan QR code
[21:13] there's so much more you can do even
[21:15] this time that I've been understanding
[21:17] of Bitcoin it's like yeah the next cycle
[21:20] there there's going to be a lot more
[21:21] adoption we've got gaming now you could
[21:22] earn sets by Gaming um Smiles app by by
[21:27] walking you are rewarded people
[21:29] understand reward structures they have
[21:30] Loyalty cards with their supermarkets
[21:32] these things are now happening with
[21:34] Bitcoin on lightning um and a lot
[21:36] there's lots more development going on
[21:38] so I think adoption I think there's a
[21:40] name the curve I can't remember the name
[21:42] of the curve but adoption happens faster
[21:45] over a period of time so for me I've
[21:47] seen massive change in the last three
[21:50] and a half years so I'm really excited
[21:51] to see what happens the next four years
[21:53] when we're on board in the Next
[21:55] Generation young or old but the class of
[21:57] 202 for onwards it's going to be so easy
[22:00] for them to understand it because they
[22:02] are already using that the technology
[22:05] with money or fear shall I say yeah I
[22:07] mean the theory is like right there this
[22:09] S curve adoption uh where you have like
[22:12] to a certain point it goes quite low uh
[22:17] and it's like usually around a decade 15
[22:19] years something like that and we are
[22:22] coming closer and closer to this point
[22:24] where Bitcoin hits this S curve adoption
[22:26] craziness and then it just takes a
[22:29] decade from like this 10% of adoption to
[22:31] like 90% adoption and uh I mean at
[22:35] madira Michael saor also talked about uh
[22:39] the gold rush in the next 10 years then
[22:41] we have now the Bitcoin ETFs in in the
[22:44] game we have a lot of public Trad
[22:46] companies we have countries in the game
[22:49] uh and pan have talked about uh
[22:51] Structured Products products that he
[22:53] expects to to come there's uh so much
[22:57] amazing things happening in Bitcoin
[23:00] right now that we can actually imagine
[23:03] or could imagine the next 10 years being
[23:06] crazy bullish on bitcoin and even maybe
[23:09] I don't know what you think about that
[23:11] maybe even breaking this fouryear cycle
[23:13] thing where we have three years up and
[23:15] one year down uh this this could break
[23:18] when we hit this like 10% and then go
[23:21] through like maybe it's coming like like
[23:24] not not now but maybe later I don't know
[23:27] uh but I think we will hit at some point
[23:29] this crazy cycle where like it's it's
[23:31] the es esve adoption is so crazy and
[23:35] people are like oh we have to take
[23:36] Bitcoin and there's so many people
[23:38] coming in it's like a flood of people uh
[23:42] because yeah fear is is is madness and
[23:44] then we have
[23:46] to take care of that definitely I keep
[23:50] quoting Michael S but s once said your
[23:52] all your models are broken we are
[23:54] looking back on data for for like the
[23:56] last three cycles and yeah they this
[23:58] cycle does look similar but going
[24:00] forward we haven't been in this
[24:02] situation as you mentioned countries um
[24:05] big corporations getting involved and
[24:08] just the the plebs on the ground the
[24:10] network has grown a number of users it's
[24:12] like yeah we can try and predict where
[24:13] it's going but I wouldn't put money
[24:16] money on that because it's just yeah
[24:19] there's so much going on it'd be hard it
[24:21] be hard to predict exactly how the cycle
[24:24] will work so again do your own research
[24:27] DCA if if you're going to invest in
[24:29] Bitcoin and just keep just keep learning
[24:31] every day definitely and one thing is
[24:33] actually different about this cycle we
[24:35] hit the alltime high before the Haring
[24:37] uh if I'm correct this never happened in
[24:39] the history before that we hit the
[24:41] alltime high before the Haring happen
[24:43] usually it's afterwards so I don't know
[24:44] if it's a sign I I I really don't care
[24:46] about that actually it's just
[24:48] interesting you talk about but my DCA
[24:51] plan is going no matter what's happening
[24:53] anyways I'm all in Bitcoin anyway so I
[24:56] don't care really but it's fun to talk
[24:58] about
[24:59] and I want to take one step back uh to
[25:02] you are professional football player you
[25:04] speak at Bitcoin conferences you do a
[25:07] lot of stuff you help people excel in
[25:09] life um what drives you like why why why
[25:14] do you do that ju just a correction I
[25:17] wasn't a professional I played sem Pro I
[25:19] I call myself a nearly man um I didn't
[25:22] quite make it I played SE Pro for a few
[25:24] years after being at a professional Club
[25:26] as as a traine um so probably was as
[25:28] close as I was ever going to be but U
[25:31] what yeah that that is exactly what
[25:32] drives me how I understand myself now my
[25:36] mindset my body um if I had this
[25:39] knowledge when I was younger I would
[25:41] have given myself a greater chance I
[25:43] never say to people I would have made it
[25:44] because who knows but my mindset now I
[25:47] would have given myself a better chance
[25:48] and that's my driver now for the next
[25:50] Generation I said I'm my father I have a
[25:52] young son who's in a similar situation
[25:54] where I was at his age at 18 where he's
[25:56] on the cuss of being a professional
[25:58] now I want to instill the values that I
[26:00] have now and habits that I say to him
[26:04] just do this again for maybe four to
[26:06] eight years between four to eight years
[26:08] and see where you end up but why I'm so
[26:10] passionate now about incorporating
[26:12] Bitcoin is because Bitcoin can offer you
[26:16] the time um again I don't want to put
[26:19] price um attach attach price to bitcoin
[26:23] at certain point but if you are dcing
[26:25] and learning about it from a young age
[26:26] where it gets to the point where you may
[26:28] decide actually I need to get a
[26:30] full-time job which then takes time away
[26:32] from your training the football you
[26:34] might be able to with your holding to
[26:36] live a Frugal lifestyle for a few more
[26:38] years so you can dedicate a bit more
[26:39] time um again doing your own research
[26:42] doing own diligence in football terms
[26:44] you can spend a bit more time Hing your
[26:45] skills that will give you that best
[26:47] opportunity and it happens to so many
[26:49] people who they come to a fork in life
[26:51] where they make decision do I
[26:52] concentrate on my craft and my passion
[26:54] or do I go into the the rat race as I
[26:57] call it I
[26:59] at one at one point went on the rap race
[27:01] route 15 years into my career I realized
[27:04] I shouldn't be here I'm a construction
[27:05] project manager and I wanted to be a
[27:06] professional footballer I had a great
[27:08] lifestyle had a family but like I didn't
[27:11] pursue my dream now I'm able to pursue
[27:13] my dream in terms
[27:14] of half and wellness that I love get
[27:17] paid for how helping people keep fit I
[27:20] get to talk about Bitcoin and I get to
[27:22] incorporate my two passions Bitcoin and
[27:24] football with my Bitcoin Ballers Academy
[27:26] training and educating young people on
[27:27] football and Bitcoin it's just yeah I'm
[27:30] happy where I am right now but I want
[27:32] have a message um that I believe should
[27:35] be passed on to young people obviously I
[27:37] speak to lots of people but for me
[27:38] specifically it's the Next Generation
[27:39] coming through trying to free that
[27:42] mindset from the fear World um which we
[27:46] are
[27:46] indoctrinated in at Birth we have no
[27:48] choice we live in that world but just
[27:50] like the Matrix you have the choice to
[27:52] take the orange pill or the or the blue
[27:54] pill and what if you have that knowledge
[27:57] you can choose actually I'm going to
[27:58] exit exit The Matrix and yeah live live
[28:01] this lifestyle that's going to create
[28:03] the best version of myself or I'm just
[28:05] going to be like everyone else it's
[28:08] amazing and I see also in the background
[28:10] the the Bitcoin Ballers shirt what
[28:13] actually is the Bitcoin Ballers what are
[28:15] you doing there so uh Bitcoin Ballers
[28:18] that was a project I started almost
[28:20] three years ago so April in 2021 and
[28:24] that was after a a few months of going
[28:27] down the rabbit Hall meeting networking
[28:29] with people I joined a learning group
[28:31] that was hosted by Daniel Prince from
[28:33] Once Bitten podcast there's about 12 of
[28:35] us on call each week U all around the
[28:37] world all different levels of
[28:39] understanding of Bitcoin just discussing
[28:41] what Bitcoin meant to us and what we
[28:43] wanted to do uh one week got a surprise
[28:45] guest on it was John bis I tell this
[28:48] story to people and some people who know
[28:50] about Bitcoin think oh my gosh John bis
[28:51] others who don't know about Bitcoin
[28:53] think who's this guy but for him I'm
[28:55] forever grateful um I introduced myself
[28:58] said I'm Jas um I'm new in Bitcoin but I
[29:01] want to provide value back CU I've got
[29:02] so much for the community uh but I'm not
[29:04] a software engineer or developer and
[29:06] then John just said why don't you
[29:08] provide value in your community then
[29:10] that moment the penny dropped it's like
[29:12] it's football and Bitcoin I'm going to
[29:13] bring the two together I I understand
[29:15] the principles and fundamentals that
[29:17] that crossover so I launched that night
[29:19] I I made made the Bitcoin bers brand on
[29:21] Instagram and we officially launched on
[29:23] the 21st of the 4th 21 so those are are
[29:26] into Bitcoin and 21 ISM would appreciate
[29:28] the date and it just so happens the
[29:30] third year birthday um coincides roughly
[29:33] with with the haran so I didn't plan it
[29:35] that way but it just just happened so
[29:37] with the Bitcoin borderers Academy or
[29:39] Bitcoin bers club brand I help educate
[29:42] young people on bitcoin through football
[29:45] but I say to people just like Bitcoin we
[29:47] have the similarities we are a
[29:49] decentralized team so you see the shirts
[29:51] behind me they are the new shirts that
[29:52] should be coming out shortly we had
[29:54] another strip that was sponsored by coin
[29:56] corner and that was funded through Gea U
[29:59] through the Gea platform uh but the
[30:01] premise is we put teams together we
[30:04] enter them in tournaments so we have
[30:05] young girls teams boys teams we had
[30:07] adult teams play or if you're just an
[30:10] individual and you want to put on a
[30:11] Bitcoin Ballers shirt you are by
[30:13] definition a Bitcoin baller um I have
[30:15] numerous skills competitions that people
[30:17] could partake in uh 21 seconds to Glow
[30:20] which is your keep yuppies so you're
[30:22] doing your football tricks how many
[30:23] skills can you do in 21 seconds we have
[30:25] a game called peer-to-peer see how many
[30:27] times you can keep the ball up between
[30:28] you and your partner and another game
[30:31] called getting off zero where you're
[30:32] shooting five balls into a Target net um
[30:36] but with with this game there is no time
[30:37] limit so you can shoot from Far Away
[30:40] really quickly the five shots but you're
[30:42] highly unlikely to get a high score or
[30:44] you can take the ball really close and
[30:45] put it in low get a low score but um to
[30:48] get a low score in a long time and this
[30:50] is talking about your time preference so
[30:52] over time the more you practice you can
[30:54] then start to shoot from a little bit
[30:55] further away and possibly hit those High
[30:56] targets so you're get in a high score in
[30:58] a quicker time liking that to your
[31:00] Bitcoin Rabbit Hole journe I wouldn't
[31:02] advise discovering Bitcoin one day and
[31:05] going all in with with with your
[31:07] investment what I suggest is take your
[31:09] time do your own research do your own
[31:11] diligence and over time you get a bit
[31:13] more confidence have your confidence
[31:14] your conviction and then taking those
[31:16] long shots from from um from far away
[31:19] getting a quick time will be it's down
[31:22] to your your proof of work and your
[31:23] conviction so people that take part in
[31:26] the games who have played in the teams
[31:28] may not understand Bitcoin to a level
[31:30] yet but I've dropped the seeds I've used
[31:32] the terminology so if they do eventually
[31:34] come across it they have an anergy oh I
[31:36] can relate that to this game that coach
[31:38] played or this game that I played with
[31:39] Bitcoin borders yes I it make sense to
[31:41] me so I'm using Bitcoin so I'm using
[31:44] football other people are using art
[31:47] literature music whatever your passion
[31:50] is link it with Bitcoin and help educate
[31:52] people because not A's going to
[31:54] understand it from the same point of
[31:56] view so if I meet someone now who not
[31:58] into football I I know I could find
[32:01] their passion and direct to someone in
[32:03] the space who's utilizes Bitcoin say oh
[32:05] check out this person Prim example
[32:08] Victoria kette she wrote truth de cage
[32:10] is's a dentist a good friend of mine is
[32:12] a dentist she's not going to understand
[32:14] bit Bitcoin through me talk about
[32:15] football but she will by reading
[32:17] Victorious book truth de Cas so it's all
[32:20] about finded meeting people where
[32:22] they're at but also incorporating your
[32:24] passion into Bitcoin and helping people
[32:27] understand understand it that way and
[32:28] having fun as well you must you got to
[32:30] have fun with it yeah that's why I'm
[32:32] also so bullish on for example like
[32:34] because we're talking about Sports
[32:35] football and Bitcoin uh there are so
[32:37] many football clubs are now putting like
[32:40] Bitcoin sponsors on there or getting
[32:43] directly Bitcoin sponsored and there's
[32:45] an Austria Club there like few other
[32:47] clubs around the world there's even real
[32:49] badford from P mccorney the I think he
[32:52] posted yesterday also a tweet that he
[32:55] wants to get in the Premier League with
[32:57] with real bfot which is an a high Target
[33:00] but let's let's see how how they can
[33:03] pull it off as I'm really I'm really
[33:05] passionate about having uh Bitcoin
[33:08] connected with the passions of people
[33:11] and then we can actually meet the people
[33:13] where they are as you said and and and
[33:16] get them to understand the power of
[33:18] sound money right yeah definitely said
[33:22] he's a headdress who was interviewed by
[33:24] Daniel Prince When your passions coll
[33:26] with your incentives amazing things
[33:28] happen and that's what Bitcoin is are
[33:29] doing we are incentivized to be the best
[33:31] versions of ourselves and to talk to
[33:33] people about Bitcoin to help them
[33:34] understand it um fight L that with your
[33:37] passion the Bitcoin Community is going
[33:39] to support you if you're a scammer
[33:40] frauder you will soon get found out and
[33:43] you will get you get push aside as I
[33:44] said but if you're creating value and
[33:47] people people can see that the bit will
[33:49] support you I know people that have
[33:51] supported me and send me SS through guys
[33:53] that don't even like football but
[33:54] because they can see my passion um they
[33:56] they know it's for a good I'm working
[33:58] with young people they want to support
[34:00] because they want to see Bitcoin
[34:02] adoption but they also want to see
[34:04] people work in the space and and follow
[34:07] their passion so yeah if you have
[34:09] something that you that you that you
[34:11] really love and you could think of a way
[34:13] to to link Bitcoin with it do it but
[34:16] don't expect results straight away I'm
[34:19] so I said three and a half years into my
[34:20] journey Bitcoin Ballers happened
[34:23] overnight but it's taken three and a
[34:25] half years to get where we are um in
[34:27] terms of
[34:28] putting teams together entering
[34:30] tournaments I've hosted my own
[34:31] tournaments we're now hope well working
[34:34] to get um registered into the world's
[34:37] biggest 7v7 tournament in car North
[34:39] Carolina which happens uh next June we
[34:43] we search for a sponsor so you can see
[34:45] uh See the space there there's space for
[34:47] sponsorship if anyone wants to put their
[34:49] logo on the front a Bitcoin company and
[34:52] the TST the soccer tournament they're
[34:53] announcing teams at the moment so
[34:54] there's 48 teams taking part with a
[34:56] chance to win $1 million
[34:58] I think they've announced 30 today so 18
[35:00] spaces left left each day that goes by
[35:03] when they announce a team we have we
[35:04] have less chance to get in but all hope
[35:07] is not lost yet um we we are in contact
[35:09] with them they are waiting for us to say
[35:10] we have the the sponsorship to get in so
[35:13] as Satoshi says you mentioned Peter
[35:15] McCormack's dream of winning the Premier
[35:16] League my dream is to take a team to the
[35:19] tournament win the million dollars get
[35:21] Bitcoin out there and show people what
[35:23] Bitcoin is about um the mainstream media
[35:26] will tell you if a drug deers criminals
[35:28] but I'm telling you no it's for
[35:30] everybody um anybody that wants
[35:33] Financial Freedom or or sovereignty we
[35:35] are a collective group of people from
[35:38] all different walks of life with shared
[35:39] belief shared understanding so as
[35:41] Satoshi says if enough people think the
[35:44] same way it becomes a self-fulfilling
[35:45] prophecy so if anyone wants to check out
[35:47] what I'm doing follow me on Twitter
[35:49] check out my web page um my YouTube
[35:52] channel because I believe this is a
[35:54] great way to help adoption across the
[35:57] the world again football is a universal
[36:00] language of a sport Bitcoin is a
[36:02] universal money for the world bringing
[36:03] bringing the two together I think it's a
[36:05] great opportunity we we have as Bitcoin
[36:07] is and we'll be playing not as Bitcoin
[36:09] bers Academy but as Bitcoin so everyone
[36:12] everyone get involved if one wins we all
[36:14] win is a ter off Co 21 Bitcoin is
[36:18] Bitcoin only from day one and they teach
[36:21] and preach self custody this is my goto
[36:25] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[36:27] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[36:29] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[36:33] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[36:35] support this podcast use code Robin and
[36:38] click the link in the description it's
[36:40] an amazing project like it's it's it's a
[36:42] tournament where you can win a million
[36:44] dollars and it's like uh with a lot of
[36:46] attention there right yeah yeah so they
[36:49] will get I think they forecasting over a
[36:51] million viewers that's what they had
[36:53] last year on by their their channels
[36:55] they've just linked with ESPN as well I
[36:57] think um on site it's like 70,000 plus
[37:01] people that would attend the tournament
[37:03] you can imagine the Winwood and tennis
[37:05] tournament um it's like that but for
[37:07] soccer or for football so it's it's an
[37:09] incredible incredible tournament it
[37:11] would be incredible if we get there and
[37:13] anyone
[37:14] listening this started as a project for
[37:16] just me on an Instagram page so this is
[37:18] just three and a half years almost
[37:20] almost one
[37:22] cycle no one knows where you're going to
[37:24] be in 3 four years time so yeah have if
[37:26] you have that idea have that project run
[37:28] with it work on it put your pral work in
[37:30] day and day out and you never know where
[37:31] you can end up it's amazing it's amazing
[37:35] and speaking of like inperson uh events
[37:38] and meetups and conferences uh I think
[37:41] it's amazing that we have all those
[37:43] Bitcoin only conferences and Bitcoin
[37:45] only meetups where where people can go
[37:47] um do do you also attend them like of
[37:50] course you were M do you also like visit
[37:53] Bitcoin meetups locally stuff like that
[37:55] and and what role do you think is is
[37:58] community in general playing in in
[38:01] Bitcoin yeah so for the big conferences
[38:03] I've been to Amsterdam twice had tickets
[38:06] to Miami twice but had to sell tickets
[38:09] because of the Restriction getting into
[38:11] the country
[38:14] me we won't talk too much more on that
[38:16] but the people that I sold tickets to
[38:18] message when they got there said it was
[38:20] easy got straight in but no in my luck I
[38:22] would have got there and got to the W I
[38:24] think some people actually did um but
[38:26] locally host of Meetup called oxit I
[38:29] just my actually drinking Al so oxit
[38:32] Meetup uh in in
[38:35] Oxford um in terms of what they provide
[38:38] for me it's just an opportunity for
[38:40] people to come and talk
[38:42] uh I joke to the last I event I had a
[38:45] couple of weeks ago there used to be
[38:47] internet meet talks people used to get
[38:48] together at cafes and talk about the
[38:50] internet we may look back when day think
[38:51] oh there were Bitcoin mebs that's crazy
[38:53] what how why would people talk about
[38:55] Bitcoin but we're out that stage where
[38:57] it's not really known so if we create
[39:00] spaces that people can come and ask
[39:01] questions we are helping the network and
[39:03] we're also helping the community so
[39:05] wherever you are you can use orange pill
[39:08] app shout out orange p app they've
[39:10] supported Bitcoin bers as well Bitcoin
[39:11] bers if you get download the app you can
[39:14] see people who are are close by with you
[39:16] arrange a meet up talk about Bitcoin
[39:18] because you might meet someone that's
[39:20] locally that that you don't know is into
[39:23] Bitcoin and have discuss ideas but also
[39:26] it's just that that convers ation you
[39:27] can have the conversation we're having
[39:29] now you might be understand I'm quite
[39:31] excited we don't really speak get the
[39:34] opportunity to speak to bitcoiners all
[39:35] the times when we do like oh my gosh I
[39:38] get to talk to someone that understands
[39:39] something similar to what I do so yeah
[39:43] it's many times as you can meet up with
[39:44] Bitcoin and have a conversation and just
[39:47] spread you're going to sound like
[39:49] Evangelical but it's like say spread the
[39:51] message spread the message that there is
[39:52] hope for me when I was in my old
[39:56] lifestyle on and on the rat
[39:59] race there wasn't much hope for the
[40:01] future I was I was hopeful for a better
[40:03] life but I couldn't really see I knew
[40:05] something wasn't quite quite right and
[40:07] it's going to sound crazy but Bitcoin is
[40:09] say all the time Bitcoin fixes this fix
[40:10] the money fix the world we' seen what's
[40:12] going on in the the world at the moment
[40:14] with all these endless Wars we believe
[40:17] we have a technology that can fix this
[40:20] so why would we not tell people about it
[40:22] and try to get them to understand it I
[40:24] believe it's our duty because we we
[40:26] understand something to to tell people
[40:28] what what good would we doing to the
[40:30] world what value would we be providing
[40:32] if we understood Bitcoin as a monetary
[40:35] policy but also has technology and
[40:37] didn't speak to one about it it doesn't
[40:39] make sense so for us if we believe that
[40:41] it can help the world we must tell the
[40:42] world about it and create those
[40:44] opportunities create those spaces for
[40:46] people to learn yeah definitely and
[40:49] it's those Bitcoin only meetups and
[40:52] especially the conferences also where
[40:53] you can meet so many people uh for me
[40:55] it's extremely uh important uh and
[40:58] that's why I also make uh advertisement
[41:01] for the Bitcoin PR conference uh I
[41:03] usually only take like sponsors on that
[41:05] I really want to work with uh Bitcoin
[41:08] brag is not a sponsor of this podcast I
[41:10] still have like a link down below where
[41:12] I can just buy tickets uh and I just
[41:15] love to bring the message out like meet
[41:18] other people in Bitcoin it's it's it's
[41:21] it's because there most bitcoiners I
[41:24] think uh that are not on bitco meups and
[41:26] not having a podcast and stuff like that
[41:28] they don't know a lot a whole lot of
[41:30] other bitcoiners but getting to know
[41:33] other bitcoiners getting in in the
[41:36] conferences in the local meetups in like
[41:37] Bitcoin prag is in Europe a big event so
[41:39] like that's it's like will be a lot of
[41:42] people there but you can also like just
[41:43] go to a local Meetup you don't have to
[41:45] spend the money to travel there you
[41:47] don't have to spend the money to get the
[41:48] tickets for that obviously you meet more
[41:51] people there but there's local meetups
[41:54] in Austria almost everywhere in Germany
[41:56] everywhere I don't know where it's how
[41:58] it's in America how it's in where you
[42:00] are based uh but uh it's there's always
[42:03] a local Meetup you can go and just speak
[42:05] with them and just connect with other
[42:07] like-minded people and it's it's so it's
[42:10] such an important thing to do if you're
[42:13] bitcoiner and and you are like because
[42:17] we are really early on and as you said
[42:20] internet there were internet meetups and
[42:23] now there's Bitcoin meetups in the
[42:24] future there will Bitcoin will at some
[42:27] point boring Bitcoin people will be like
[42:31] why did you went to a Bitcoin Meetup
[42:32] it's like have Fe fear meetups I'm go to
[42:36] Great British CR
[42:38] Meetup so uh use that opportunity now to
[42:42] meet like such curious and like-minded
[42:44] people and I just can I can anybody just
[42:47] encourage to just meet people uh for
[42:50] that are
[42:51] bitcoiners um I like what you say you
[42:53] keep talking about Bitcoin only as well
[42:55] um we live in a world of freedom of
[42:59] choice and I say to people um but the
[43:03] cat can't dismiss the internet do you
[43:04] have you heard of that saying before the
[43:06] the what the cat the cat can't dismiss
[43:10] the internet oh yeah it's um do you know
[43:13] it yeah oh oh you don't know so there a
[43:17] term an analogy I heard from Russell
[43:18] Brand the comedian um and he said I have
[43:22] a cat that I really love we have fun uh
[43:25] I feed my cat my cat lives in my house
[43:27] but I let the cat out and it goes off
[43:29] and does what it does in the world the
[43:31] cat comes home sits on my nap and I'm on
[43:33] the internet but the cat who has
[43:35] knowledge of the world has no idea what
[43:38] I'm doing on the internet but the cat
[43:39] cannot say that the internet doesn't
[43:40] exist but it has no understanding of it
[43:42] but you can't dismiss it so I say to
[43:44] people I tell you to learn about Bitcoin
[43:47] and Bitcoin only or learn about Bitcoin
[43:49] first you have the freedom of choice to
[43:52] learn about altcoins or other
[43:54] Investments um I'm not dismissing that
[43:57] you can make money on altcoins and other
[43:59] Investments what I'm saying to you
[44:02] is it's manipulated it's scammed you're
[44:04] highly likely to get rug pulled but I
[44:07] can't tell you you must do Bitcoin only
[44:10] so I'm not dismissing the fact that you
[44:12] can make gains or whatever you want to
[44:14] call it and have fun or as Peter M says
[44:16] go and gamble you're free to do that for
[44:18] me I'm focusing focusing on a technology
[44:21] that I believe can out of the world um
[44:24] but I'm also having fun doing it you may
[44:26] not see it as fun you is slow and waren
[44:28] um but I'm having my my delay
[44:31] gratification my low time preference so
[44:33] yeah Bitcoin only um meetups reading
[44:38] listening you are what we shouldn't do
[44:41] is dismiss everything that's going on
[44:43] and not learn about it because you have
[44:44] to know what's going on in the world of
[44:46] space and be able to have a uh critical
[44:49] have critical Ence on what's going on
[44:51] but yeah ignore the the noise just
[44:54] concentrate on the signal which is what
[44:56] Bitcoin is and I
[44:59] appreciate especially young people now
[45:01] we live in a a world of fast money um
[45:05] get things easy learning about crypto
[45:07] and altcoins because some promoter is
[45:10] telling you about it making fun making
[45:12] easy I'm I'm asking you to do something
[45:14] that's gotot harder I'm asking you to do
[45:17] maybe two hours of research a day I'm
[45:19] going to send you a link to read I'm
[45:21] going to send you a book to read that's
[45:23] a lot more work but I think you'll get a
[45:25] lot more value and benefit and more
[45:27] Overlook the long term so that's my
[45:29] message to people follow the the signal
[45:31] don't listen to the noise bitco yeah
[45:34] it's it's it's sometimes I was in 2021 I
[45:38] was uh on Tik Tok I made Tik Tok videos
[45:41] uh which I still regret but it's it is
[45:45] what it is I learned a lot of stuff from
[45:47] there and I got a lot of comments I also
[45:50] went back then I made about Bitcoin uh
[45:53] Bitcoin videos also about other stuff
[45:55] like there was not so focused on on on
[45:58] bitcoin as I now but the comment I got
[46:02] on bitcoin because I was only focusing
[46:03] on bitcoin and other Investments but not
[46:05] cryptos like I was focusing on Tesla and
[46:07] other stuff but never altcoins and the
[46:10] comments I got the most was like but why
[46:13] do you focus on bitcoin you can make
[46:15] 100x more money on the altcoins on Shino
[46:18] on saon all those coins that are
[46:21] just scamming people and I'm not saying
[46:23] all the ALCS will go to zero but they
[46:26] will be really close to zero compared to
[46:29] bitcoin because there might be some
[46:32] collector's value I don't know I don't I
[46:34] cannot say they are all going to zero uh
[46:37] they're definitely not money they're
[46:38] definitely not what Bitcoin is they're
[46:40] definitely completely something else uh
[46:42] I think they at best inefficient what
[46:44] they're doing and at worst a complete
[46:46] scam and shitcoin uh but yeah it's it's
[46:50] it's it's for me that's why I want to
[46:52] put out the the high signal Bitcoin only
[46:55] like if I see something in the bio of a
[46:58] guest like crypto or web web free or
[47:02] blockchain
[47:03] technology he's not on my podcast I have
[47:07] bit I have people on that are 5% in
[47:10] Bitcoin and the rest is in gold and they
[47:12] have some other stuff that is okay for
[47:14] me gold is in leged investment I don't
[47:17] only want to have full 100% bitcoiners
[47:19] on but I'm not going to invite
[47:22] scammers yeah yeah it it that's a signal
[47:25] isn't it it it tells you about that
[47:27] person um so for me I have friendship
[47:31] groups um we talk on WhatsApp and the
[47:34] the most recent comment was oh which
[47:36] coin are we going to back this cycle and
[47:38] they know me as the the Bitcoin only guy
[47:40] they call me sailor carbon and somebody
[47:42] said oh wait for wait for Jas to comment
[47:45] and their reasoning was which I can
[47:47] totally understand oh Bitcoin is not
[47:48] going to 10x in in this cycle so I just
[47:51] sent in the video of saor saying it's
[47:53] going up forever Laura now are you
[47:55] looking for quick fat gains for to 10x
[47:59] because you you tolerate lar of money
[48:01] now or do you want to invest in
[48:02] something that I believe will be
[48:04] generational wealth for your children
[48:05] and your children's children so got to
[48:08] look at your your time scales I totally
[48:11] again I'm not dismissing why you want to
[48:12] make lots of money now but for me i' say
[48:14] but that's a risk I don't want to spend
[48:18] my time and my energy trying to find one
[48:21] out of 20,000 plus coins that may 10x or
[48:25] 100x or whatever
[48:28] I'd rather just focus on on on the one
[48:30] thing and be comfortable and not worry
[48:34] at night and be up all night and a
[48:36] friend of mine I'm not going to do any
[48:38] names but has come to that realization
[48:41] where they were spending all night up
[48:44] watching charts but then not spending
[48:46] time with their family and then thinking
[48:47] about it at work and at this point I was
[48:50] then we've just understanding Bitcoin
[48:52] and I like yeah what are we trying to
[48:54] achieve here we want time Freedom now
[48:58] you're searching for that one that may
[48:59] give you time freedom but in this
[49:01] process of doing so you're damaging
[49:03] yourself your the time your family
[49:05] you're damaging yourself your your
[49:07] Wellness in terms of your health and
[49:09] mindset but yeah just lower your time FR
[49:12] and sit back focus on the one thing
[49:15] enjoy your family and there are no
[49:18] guarantees in life but I'm there UNC can
[49:21] say Bitcoin it will outperform as you
[49:24] said every single altcoin that's been
[49:26] being marketed to you right now by
[49:28] somebody that has just copied the uh the
[49:30] Bitcoin code and added their own little
[49:32] thing but just just trying to make
[49:34] making money for
[49:36] themselves and I think it's a mind virus
[49:39] if you have this uh Gamble mindset this
[49:43] um Lottery mindset is like I have a
[49:46] strict rule I will never spend money on
[49:49] anything that's based on luck uh based
[49:53] on Gamble based on uh like uh just just
[49:57] pure Lottery stuff uh I never
[50:00] participated in any giveaways like
[50:03] comment here maybe you get something
[50:06] never not because the investment of me
[50:08] typing in and liking something is so
[50:10] high just because I don't want to
[50:13] participate in those games because it's
[50:15] not it's it's it's it's it's a think
[50:18] starting of a mind virus first it's a
[50:20] small giveaway then you play Lottery all
[50:23] of the sudden you're spending €20 per
[50:25] month on something that you might get a
[50:28] big shot but you're actually losing
[50:29] every month money because those those
[50:32] games are riged from Arts point of view
[50:35] uh and the same thing is with with with
[50:38] altcoins with shitcoins um of course you
[50:41] can make a lot of money if you are lucky
[50:44] but you can also go in a casino and bet
[50:46] on on green and bet on on on red I'm not
[50:50] dismissing that you can make a lot of
[50:51] money I'm just saying whereas like you
[50:55] have a choice like do you want to play
[50:57] lottery or do you actually want to
[50:58] provide value for other people and be um
[51:02] provide value basically so and I tend to
[51:07] just make like Bitcoin is my savings
[51:10] technology and I will provide value for
[51:12] other peoples and that way I get value
[51:15] from other people back and can save it
[51:18] and can spend the rest of my time with
[51:20] family with friends uh and with stuff I
[51:24] want to do like this is uh yeah sorry
[51:27] for this small ramble but this is had to
[51:29] go no no totally appreciate it and this
[51:31] conversations I have in my mind daily
[51:33] and have with friends and family um so
[51:36] it's always nice again to speak to other
[51:37] B cies you understand it because if you
[51:39] didn't have this opportunity to speak
[51:41] with other people it can become draining
[51:45] but also um ex yeah it can become
[51:48] exhausting because you have an
[51:50] understanding or think a certain way
[51:52] others around you aren't and you're
[51:54] constantly battling it's like
[51:57] where where where are my people uh so
[51:59] yeah with the with the hoodies that I
[52:00] I've started to make I found I had one
[52:02] called f tribe um I met somebody again
[52:05] through orange forap who lived locally
[52:07] to me who I thought Liv Million Miles
[52:10] Away but we were able to link up we've
[52:12] met we've met numerous times but we are
[52:14] able to have conversation we don't we W
[52:16] agree on everything but we come in from
[52:18] the same start point and yeah find your
[52:21] trbe we are out there um to bitcoiners
[52:24] that are listening don't be disheartened
[52:26] if you are the only bit Corner in the
[52:28] village maybe someone else someone else
[52:30] lurk it amazing amazing and maybe for
[52:34] that like OHA moment and this uh Bitcoin
[52:37] are getting um what was for you like an
[52:40] absolute massive like oh this is
[52:42] Bitcoin like did you had this light bulp
[52:45] moment uh in Bitcoin where like oh
[52:48] Bitcoin is actually changing the world
[52:50] uh I mean you talked a little bit
[52:51] beforee had about your rabbit holes
[52:53] story uh but did do you have like one
[52:56] thing where like oh I learned this about
[52:59] Bitcoin and all of a sudden it makes
[53:00] sense for me now yeah I mentioned at the
[53:04] start I always felt like there wasn't
[53:06] something quite right I couldn't put my
[53:07] finger on and I like it it to Neo in The
[53:09] Matrix where he knew the world around
[53:11] him was wasn't quite real um for me i'
[53:14] started the my rabbit hole Journey learn
[53:15] about Bitcoin and in the same month
[53:18] another friend of mine told me to watch
[53:20] Z
[53:21] gist have you heard of the
[53:23] film uh like um yeah it's like a
[53:27] documentary but it talks about the
[53:28] history of the world um been talk about
[53:30] religion and money but it was I won't
[53:32] give too much away but it was the final
[53:33] scene uh so this this movie was made I
[53:37] believe in
[53:38] 200 S I probably got that wrong but it
[53:41] was before Bitcoin was was released for
[53:44] released Bitcoin so this was an orange
[53:47] called aha moment when at the end of the
[53:50] film they talk about shutting people's
[53:52] money off in cbdcs and it was then
[53:54] they're like that's it this is isn't
[53:56] plann this is the place this is going to
[53:58] happen Bitcoin is the
[54:00] antidote this is this is what's going to
[54:02] save us up until that point yes I I
[54:05] could see how it works but yeah is that
[54:08] point in the film thought yeah this this
[54:09] is what Bitcoin is for this is what it's
[54:11] about amazing uh before we end up the
[54:14] podcast um I have to ask you who's your
[54:17] favorite football player who's your
[54:18] favorite
[54:20] team my favorite player and and T they
[54:23] probably coincide they come together it
[54:25] was Ian right and Arsenal so I started
[54:28] started supporting Arsenal because of
[54:30] Ian Wright um and I believe he hasn't
[54:32] the typical Bitcoin of story he never
[54:34] gave up he became a professional
[54:36] football player late um but continued to
[54:38] to to to show his prer work when he
[54:40] played long League got a chance at
[54:42] Crystal Palace and then played for
[54:44] Arsenal became what the highest goal
[54:45] scorer still involved with with the club
[54:47] now and yeah never really conformed to
[54:53] what I thought should be so I always
[54:54] spoke as this true opinions um which is
[54:57] what we want to do as bitcoiners we want
[54:58] freedom of speech and how he played on
[55:00] the pitch he played played with freedom
[55:02] in Flair um I think that's what Bitcoin
[55:05] should do live your life how you want to
[55:06] live it as long as you're not harming
[55:08] anyone intentionally harming anyone or
[55:11] as long as you're creating value for
[55:12] people he created value on the pitch by
[55:14] scoring great goals and being
[55:15] entertaining so yeah I I right is my my
[55:18] football hero and Arsenal are my
[55:20] football team amazing amazing how about
[55:23] you do you have a team do do you have a
[55:24] football team I have team yes it's it's
[55:27] Red Bull salsburg it's an Austrian
[55:30] football uh Team I'm not watching a lot
[55:33] of
[55:34] football but I have this I have this
[55:36] routine where I go uh once a season or
[55:41] all two years or something like that uh
[55:43] do a Champions League match from Red
[55:45] Bull salsburg uh with my dad it's more
[55:48] about the moment with my dad and less
[55:50] about uh the the game itself uh I was
[55:54] for like a few years big Red Bull
[55:56] salsburg fan uh was in like I watched
[56:00] like regularly every second week or a
[56:02] football game now I almost never watch
[56:07] it probably it will change a little bit
[56:09] with the the World Cup uh because then
[56:11] all of the on everybody's watching again
[56:14] uh but I'm I'm I'm always saying like I
[56:17] I don't play games I I don't uh do a lot
[56:20] because now I'm like really focused on
[56:23] on building this podcast and building so
[56:25] much stuff uh I I really enjoy watching
[56:28] maybe I'm starting again when like
[56:30] retired with like 17 years old or
[56:32] something like that because I I totally
[56:35] understand yeah so you speak about in a
[56:38] Bitcoin space bread and circuses don't
[56:40] we so I totally understand that you
[56:41] people may see Sport AS bre and circuses
[56:44] I don't watch a lot of football now
[56:45] because whenever I'm doing something
[56:48] Bitcoin probably like you in the back of
[56:49] your mind how can what what is bitcoin
[56:52] how can it relate to this situation or
[56:54] all I've thought about this about
[56:55] Bitcoin um but I appreciate football is
[56:57] a great medium for people to understand
[56:59] it so that's why I use football but um
[57:02] yeah I I don't watch football as much as
[57:04] I used to um because like you dedicating
[57:06] your time to something that you believe
[57:08] is more more valuable for for the world
[57:10] yeah I mean I have also this like
[57:12] whenever I spend time just watching
[57:15] stuff uh and not spending with family
[57:19] girlfriend U friends or something like
[57:21] that or being productive uh I don't know
[57:24] if this is healthy or not
[57:28] but I always have this like oh I could
[57:31] do uh now edit the video I could do
[57:33] something else I could do some some
[57:35] better tweets I could do something
[57:37] productive with my life or something
[57:39] else maybe I can I can finally start my
[57:41] newsletter that I'm talking about like a
[57:43] few weeks now I did not do it now I
[57:47] could I want to um write a book next
[57:50] year uh and and I still like I could
[57:54] just start it now like why wait till
[57:56] next year so like always like when I'm
[57:59] laidback and not eating something not
[58:02] doing something that I have to do or
[58:03] spending time with family and friends
[58:05] and have this like oh I could do
[58:07] something productive now so like why I'm
[58:09] not doing it well it's a a call it
[58:12] should we call it a healthy Obsession so
[58:15] it's good it's good for the mind and
[58:16] body it's definitely an obsession uh I
[58:19] don't I don't want to be the charge of
[58:21] if it if it's
[58:23] healthy but it it makes about your time
[58:26] preference doesn't it so which whatever
[58:28] you choose to do you take responsibility
[58:30] for that and if it doesn't benefit you
[58:32] immediately or in the future you have to
[58:34] ask yourself the question why why am I
[58:36] doing yeah and the the the good thing is
[58:39] like everything I'm doing is will
[58:41] benefit me as I think really greatly in
[58:44] the future so I'm I'm do I'm doing it
[58:46] for future Robin that future Robin can
[58:48] relax and watch
[58:50] TV ex exactly that delay gratification
[58:54] yeah definitely uh we're coming to the
[58:55] end routine of our podcast where the
[58:58] previous guest uh that was on my show is
[59:00] asking a question for the next guest
[59:02] kind of the blockchain uh is where every
[59:05] guest is connected to each other um and
[59:08] the question for you is what do you see
[59:09] as the biggest challenge for uh Bitcoin
[59:13] adoption in the coming
[59:15] years um for me it's just the
[59:17] understanding of it um most recently
[59:21] think there's an influencer that's come
[59:22] out that said he's doing interviews with
[59:24] people Al the har is coming which there
[59:26] will be only 10.5 Bitcoin 10.5 billion
[59:29] Bitcoins available like no no you
[59:32] haven't understood it and you now you're
[59:35] giving people misinformation so for me
[59:37] it's education that's the biggest
[59:38] challenge we spoke about adoption how
[59:41] it's becoming easier but with that we
[59:43] need to make sure people are educated
[59:46] um either you're doing educating
[59:49] yourself yourself with the podcast by
[59:51] sou for the Bitcoin Ballers or if you're
[59:53] just finding information out intending
[59:55] people
[59:56] podcasts to read to listen to books to
[59:58] read YouTube videos to
[60:00] watch um yeah we need to
[60:03] be do our due diligence with the
[60:06] information that we're providing to
[60:07] people and not just telling them learn
[60:09] about Bitcoin and leaving them to their
[60:10] own devices they may F end up following
[60:13] this you this influencer taking his
[60:15] advice and end up getting scammed rug
[60:19] pulled or having a bad experience of
[60:21] Bitcoin which I know people have had
[60:22] this cycle just because they've heard
[60:26] has heard about Bitcoin they bought some
[60:29] watched it go down sold in their
[60:31] experiences oh bitcoin's a investment I
[60:33] lost money okay but did you learn about
[60:35] it did you read did you listen did you
[60:39] ask questions or did you just follow
[60:41] somebody so yeah biggest barrier will be
[60:44] the education but I believe we're making
[60:46] fantastic strides in doing so there's so
[60:48] much out there as we said there's no
[60:51] excuse definitely and I'm I'm looking
[60:54] forward to the this years uh this this
[60:57] cycle is noise because I think always in
[60:59] the the bull runs the noise is getting
[61:02] bigger and this is why I like I really
[61:05] like 2022 and even last year because it
[61:07] was kind of low on the noise and this
[61:10] year you can already see like the first
[61:13] months it's like there's there there's
[61:15] this influences as you mentioned uh
[61:17] coming up there's so much noise coming
[61:19] up in the Bitcoin Community it's fun to
[61:21] document it's definitely gets me more
[61:23] View for the podcast uh but but honestly
[61:26] I prefer the bare markets there are
[61:29] where all the bitcoiners are in there
[61:31] and all the bitcoiners that are building
[61:33] stuff in Bitcoin are in there and where
[61:35] the hard grind is really and this is the
[61:37] this is the stuff I'm really passionate
[61:38] about and the bull market is fun I I
[61:42] document everything I will interview
[61:44] over 300 people this year on this
[61:46] podcast wow uh I have to also this plan
[61:50] to have Michael saor as a 300s guest in
[61:53] in the end of the year on I did not ask
[61:54] him by now but let's see if he says yes
[61:56] if I'm asking put it put it out there he
[61:59] he's he's done so much for so many
[62:01] people online just by retweeting and
[62:03] commenting so again if if enough people
[62:07] believe it it becomes a self-fulfilling
[62:08] prophecy if you share this clip I'll
[62:10] share it it may get back to him
[62:12] somehow yeah he actually um uh there was
[62:16] a time last year where a lot of people
[62:19] made this AI pictures of Bitcoin uh and
[62:22] I also like did it every day like eight
[62:24] of them and actually Michael saor
[62:26] reposted and tagged me on those uh uh
[62:30] bit uh photos like every third day or
[62:32] something like that he definitely is in
[62:34] my like he definitely saw me but it's a
[62:36] different story but yeah I will I I will
[62:38] do everything in my power to to get in
[62:41] as a the 300th guest on my podcast
[62:44] because this is my goal for the year and
[62:46] I think what better way to end it as
[62:48] with Michael saor yeah definitely
[62:51] perfect then I I hope it happens it will
[62:53] happen put it
[62:54] into manest it it will happen I I I try
