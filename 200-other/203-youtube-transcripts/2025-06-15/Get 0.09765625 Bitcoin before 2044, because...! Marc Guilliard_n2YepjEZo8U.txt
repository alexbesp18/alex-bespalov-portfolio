[00:00] if you divide 8 billion people and let's
[00:02] say we have like 450 Bitcoin a day this
[00:04] means you need six satoshis a day we
[00:06] have like more Bitcoin than the average
[00:08] guy the concept of retirement is stupid
[00:10] because we want to do what we love and
[00:12] if when we do what we love we don't
[00:14] retire 2044 it's the first year we have
[00:17] like a BL block subsidy with less than
[00:19] 0.1 Bitcoin it's 0.0
[00:22] 9765 625 Bitcoin so if you buy today for
[00:26] €7,000 you weigh 20 years then you have
[00:28] a full block subsidy and this is so
[00:30] awesome because in 20 years the hash
[00:32] rate will be way higher so there will be
[00:33] miners all around the world mining for
[00:36] this 0.1 Bitcoin and you today can with
[00:38] €7,000 buy one block subsidy in 20 years
[00:42] everything is yeah more abundant Bitcoin
[00:44] is scarce the price has to go up forever
[00:46] we really have to go back to the source
[00:47] of the problems and not just fix like
[00:49] symptoms the half life of Fiat is like
[00:52] 35 years and the half life of Bitcoin is
[00:54] Forever at some point your Bitcoin stack
[00:55] is growing faster then you as an
[00:57] individual can earn Revenue SOI was
[01:00] engineer of the star of value
[01:02] [Music]
[01:05] problem hi Mark how you doing everything
[01:07] fine hey Robin I'm super good I am yeah
[01:11] glad to be in your podcast I love it
[01:13] yeah really looking forward I'm doing so
[01:15] many podcast and uh it's my only my
[01:18] third podcast that is in no my yeah my
[01:21] fourth podcast is in person so like I'm
[01:23] glad that you have you on and uh a
[01:25] background story also for maybe
[01:27] interesting for my viewers Mark was the
[01:30] first one that ever interviewed me on
[01:32] his channel so uh it isn't German
[01:35] otherwise I would have linked it but
[01:37] might still link it so that people can
[01:39] check it out so thank you first of all
[01:41] like to for you trusting in me that I
[01:43] have something to say it's like really
[01:45] cool then I had like almost no followers
[01:48] and had like nothing to offer but yeah
[01:51] it was it was great uh how is PR so far
[01:54] uh pretty good pretty good I mean it's
[01:56] like the biggest Bitcoin conference in
[01:57] the world and I pretty fast realized
[02:00] this that you're like really into
[02:02] Bitcoin because you can almost smell
[02:05] this I mean if you just talk like two
[02:06] minutes with a guide and you see okay is
[02:08] he like deep into Bitcoin or is he like
[02:10] just like blah blah but I pretty fast
[02:14] realized that you're pretty deep into
[02:15] Bitcoin and therefore I'm super glad for
[02:17] your success and it's well deserved uh
[02:20] thank you Mark and today I wanted to
[02:22] talk about with you like you you're
[02:24] pretty broad guy like you can cover so
[02:26] many topics uh but we talked about the
[02:29] upcoming bull
[02:30] there's definitely something coming in
[02:32] 2045 at least I would be really
[02:34] disappointed if nothing comes at all um
[02:38] what do you expect and what do you say
[02:41] like how much should we at least stack
[02:44] mhm yeah so before we start so just
[02:47] small introduction so I'm Mark and I
[02:49] also have like a German YouTube channel
[02:52] so we have we are actually one of the
[02:54] most feed Bitcoin only channels of the
[02:56] world even though we are in German it's
[02:59] super impress impressive because block
[03:00] trainer is like the most watched and
[03:02] he's also in German and then like there
[03:04] are some other channels but then like we
[03:06] are pretty much on somewhere on the top
[03:09] this is super interesting because the
[03:10] German yeah Society or the German crowd
[03:14] is really really strong and yeah there's
[03:16] always like this discussions of how many
[03:18] Bitcoin do you need and I'm also like
[03:21] doing lots of content and there are like
[03:22] different approaches to this so some say
[03:25] okay one Bitcoin so this is like the
[03:28] British hotle aspect so get it at least
[03:30] one Bitcoin then there is like 0.1
[03:32] Bitcoin because people say okay the
[03:34] price appreciation will be so great that
[03:37] even 0.1 Bitcoin will be like super
[03:40] great in the future but there is like
[03:44] yeah some pretty nice mths going on so
[03:48] if you look like okay we have like 8
[03:50] billion people in the world and if you
[03:52] divide like 8 billion people through 21
[03:55] million Bitcoin then you get like
[04:00] 0.265 Bitcoin so this is like the
[04:03] average ratio you need to be at least
[04:07] like to have at least more Bitcoin than
[04:09] the the average Joe than the average guy
[04:11] than the average guy right now what what
[04:13] does the average guy like is it like
[04:15] 8,000 or what is the average net worth
[04:17] right now I'm not so sure I'm not so I
[04:20] mean it depends a lot it depends a lot
[04:21] it depends a lot but let's say we in a
[04:23] Bitcoin standard and you have
[04:26] 0.265 Bitcoin then you have more than
[04:29] the average
[04:30] and now now comes the crazy thing if you
[04:34] divide like 8 billion people and you see
[04:38] and and let's say we have like 450
[04:40] Bitcoin a day this means you need six
[04:44] satoshis a day to have like more Bitcoin
[04:47] than the average guy so you just need
[04:49] six satoshis a day so if you buy like a
[04:51] coffee then you have like a whole ratio
[04:53] for like one year of Bitcoin and you
[04:56] have more like the average guy can buy
[04:59] Bitcoin to accumulate six satosi a day
[05:02] well repeat it again yes yes you have
[05:04] you have to buy Six satoshis a day and
[05:07] just buy this like over a long time and
[05:10] then you have like more than the average
[05:12] person can buy because at the at at yeah
[05:16] right now we produce like 550 Bitcoin a
[05:19] day and we have like 8 billion people
[05:21] and if you just uh sum up the the
[05:23] numbers then you get to the six satosi
[05:26] amazing yeah so lots of people think you
[05:28] need like uh huge number you need like
[05:30] 10 Bitcoin you need like yeah 20 Bitcoin
[05:34] and also like it depends like how is the
[05:36] price appreciation going on so if you
[05:39] let's say in 10 years we are like let's
[05:41] say we are like at a million okay then
[05:44] probably one Bitcoin is pretty much
[05:46] let's say if we have like 10 million in
[05:48] purchasing power I mean this would be in
[05:51] real value this would be like 20 million
[05:54] price or 50 million price I'm not sure
[05:56] but let's say in 10 years we have like 1
[05:58] million in today's purchase power then
[06:00] one Bitcoin can be pretty awesome and
[06:03] even like super super small allocations
[06:05] in the case we get to a Bitcoin standard
[06:07] like
[06:08] 0.265 Bitcoin can be like probably not
[06:12] to have be like the richest man in the
[06:13] world but to at least have something
[06:16] pretty good and it also depends on what
[06:18] your time frame is because if like uh if
[06:21] you want to retire on Bitcoin in the
[06:23] next five years you probably need a lot
[06:25] more than 0.1 Bitcoin uh but if you're
[06:28] like as me I'm 25 years old I'm pretty
[06:31] stoked with my uh Bitcoin stack because
[06:33] I can still stack on a lot uh and even
[06:36] in the future like I I don't even want
[06:39] to retire because I still just want to
[06:41] work and and do something for society
[06:43] but even if I want to retire I have a
[06:46] pretty long uh go where I can go it's
[06:48] really interesting what else do you
[06:50] expect for like the the 2024 and 2025
[06:54] hopefully Bull Run yeah wait wait before
[06:55] we come to the bull run there is there
[06:57] is a good way to like think about this
[07:01] because it's always like about time and
[07:03] about like what's your living cost so
[07:06] there's like people okay when can you
[07:08] retire I mean it's a stupid idea because
[07:10] we don't want to retire actually the the
[07:12] concept of retirement is stupid because
[07:15] we want to do what we love and if when
[07:17] we do what we love we don't retire and
[07:19] also we always get more money than we
[07:21] need for our living consume so the
[07:23] retirement concept is in my opinion
[07:25] [ __ ] but let's say you have like a
[07:28] time horizont let's say or 20 30 or 40
[07:30] it doesn't matter but to think about
[07:33] okay maybe it's a cool achievement to at
[07:37] least get a whole PL subsidy so the
[07:41] plock subsidy is getting smaller smaller
[07:43] smaller smaller and here comes the time
[07:44] frame in so let's say you want to have
[07:47] like for example there is like let me
[07:49] check the numbers so I don't I don't say
[07:52] anything
[07:54] wrong so let's let's say you have like
[07:57] 20 years so in
[08:00] 2044 the block subsidy of like every
[08:04] every 10 minutes what the miners are
[08:05] like mining is like
[08:09] 0.976
[08:11] 5625 Bitcoin it's almost 0.1 Bitcoin so
[08:15] if you buy now 0.1 Bitcoin and right now
[08:18] 0.1 Bitcoin is like $7,000 US and if you
[08:22] wait 20 years then you have like a whole
[08:25] block subsidy so your goal should be to
[08:28] get at least one block subsidy and then
[08:30] have the time frame to at least wait as
[08:33] long as yeah to be at the place where
[08:36] this block subsidy is like the reality
[08:38] and then you have like a good
[08:41] measurement of yeah maybe that's a
[08:43] that's a nice goal and depending on how
[08:45] long you can
[08:46] weit lesser and lesser Bitcoin are yeah
[08:50] how did you come up with the block sub
[08:52] like where's this uh coming from yeah
[08:54] the block subsidy I mean there's like
[08:56] Bitcoin is open source and Bitcoin is
[08:58] like a a transparent leer and I mean
[09:01] every four years the block sub subsidy
[09:03] half so we have like 50 Bitcoin 25
[09:05] Bitcoin 12.5 Bitcoin then 6 point and so
[09:08] and so on and in
[09:10] 2044 it's the first year we have like a
[09:13] BL block subsidy with less than 0 one
[09:15] Bitcoin it's
[09:17] 0.0
[09:18] 9765 625 Bitcoin and so if you buy today
[09:22] for 7,000 EUR you wait 20 years then you
[09:25] have a full block subsidy and this is so
[09:27] awesome because in 20 years the hash
[09:30] rate will be way higher so there will be
[09:32] miners all around the world mining for
[09:35] this almost this 0.1 Bitcoin and you
[09:38] today can with €7,000 buy one block
[09:41] subsidy in 20 years and this is so
[09:43] awesome because in 20 years I mean yeah
[09:46] it's not a fair comparison because
[09:48] miners also get like transaction cost
[09:51] yeah but to to think how mind-blowing
[09:54] this is and you can even top this if you
[09:56] think like I'm buying today like a
[09:58] coffee and if you like 80 years in the
[10:00] future the whole black subsidy will be
[10:02] the satoshis you pay today for a coffee
[10:05] and this is like ultimative mind-blowing
[10:07] and then you really start to realize
[10:09] Bitcoin scarcity is not a joke Bitcoin
[10:11] scarcity is like the most brutal thing
[10:13] in the world and the mathematical
[10:16] numbers are so mind-blowing and this is
[10:18] like just yeah Po mindblow and it's
[10:21] fascinating for me because uh today I
[10:24] was at the waterproof where I can buy
[10:27] water and like she call she said like
[10:29] credit card or Sates and I said like
[10:33] wait I don't want to spend my Sates like
[10:35] it it feels so so so much worse to spend
[10:38] satosi than just spending Euros even
[10:41] though it's the same because I can also
[10:42] like spend the satosi and instantly buy
[10:45] back the Sates spend and replay it would
[10:47] not make a really huge difference
[10:50] despite that then I have tax
[10:51] implications and all that stuff uh but
[10:54] uh that it does something with your
[10:55] brain living on a Bitcoin St it does
[10:57] something with your brain oh there only
[10:58] 20 1 million uh if I give this thousand
[11:01] Sates away I have to work to get it back
[11:04] it doesn't hurt if you dump so if you're
[11:06] just like trashing your Bitcoin and
[11:07] let's say here is your Bitcoin and give
[11:09] me the Satoshi then it does not hurt but
[11:11] if you really like realizing okay today
[11:14] I'm like for example today I'm buying
[11:16] like a car for 0.1 Bitcoin but on the
[11:21] other side I could just weigh 20 years
[11:23] and I have a block I have a full block
[11:25] subsidy I mean then really comes the
[11:27] pain in and this is like this this the
[11:30] thing because you always have those
[11:31] opportunity costs you always have the
[11:33] choice between okay I buy car now or in
[11:36] 20 years I have a whole block subsidy I
[11:38] can buy a cappuccino now or in 80 years
[11:41] I have a full block subsidy and this is
[11:43] like and this is like a crazy comparison
[11:46] which lets you realize how scarce and
[11:48] how awesome Bitcoin is and I mean it's
[11:51] like Michael saor says in
[11:53] 20134 99% of all Bitcoin are mined and
[11:57] then over a period of 100 years or not
[11:59] even yeah 100 years it's like 1% new
[12:02] Supply and that's it and Bitcoin SC gets
[12:05] scarcer scarcer scarcer everything else
[12:08] gets like yeah spread more spread around
[12:12] it's easier to produce gold it's easier
[12:14] to produce silver it's easier to produce
[12:17] houses everything is yeah more abundant
[12:19] Bitcoin is scarce the price has to go up
[12:22] forever I love it a lot um when we now
[12:27] put that even like a little bit more in
[12:29] the future and I always like to ask a
[12:31] question it's kind of like an routine
[12:33] question that almost everyone asked and
[12:36] even including Mich today um we have
[12:39] Bitcoin uh we kind of could imagine
[12:42] living on a Bitcoin standard Bitcoin
[12:43] could become actually money uh it's a a
[12:46] lot of debates on like could it actually
[12:48] be money or is it just a store value but
[12:50] besides that uh we have a sound system
[12:53] where we can save our financial energy
[12:55] when we keep that in mind um that's do
[12:59] you think that changes something in
[13:02] society so if we have like sound money
[13:05] if this changes something in society I
[13:08] see it always like um if you run on Sand
[13:11] you can still run it's okay uh it's a
[13:13] little bit muddy uh the Sand Drags you
[13:16] down but you can still run but if you're
[13:19] on a solid Street uh you can run way
[13:21] faster it makes way more fun to to run
[13:24] on a solid Street and then you're faster
[13:25] and you can do stuff uh and there's no
[13:28] no force that drag you down but right
[13:30] right now we are one of the few people
[13:32] that have Bitcoin I mean it's even worse
[13:34] we're not running a society on Sand we
[13:35] are R we are like building a society on
[13:38] dog
[13:40] [ __ ] yeah imagine they're running on dog
[13:42] [ __ ] and people are wondering why are
[13:44] there problems why is it not working
[13:46] because that's the thing most people
[13:49] forget we really have to go back to the
[13:51] source of the problems and not just fix
[13:54] like symptoms and I mean it's like just
[13:56] we have like this this stem and it's
[13:58] cracking everywhere and then people are
[14:00] okay here a little money they put their
[14:02] money we put everything full of money
[14:04] but it doesn't work it's like yeah it's
[14:06] like you're you're like super ill the
[14:09] body is super ill and you just give yeah
[14:11] here's your medication and here's some
[14:13] drugs and more drugs more drugs and we
[14:15] need more and more trugs we are addicted
[14:18] we are addicted to money and then we are
[14:20] wondering okay we're building a society
[14:22] on dog [ __ ] because Fiat is actually I
[14:25] mean dog [ __ ] is probably a bit a good
[14:28] compar
[14:30] because I mean it kind of works from the
[14:32] payment aspect and everything else but
[14:34] it's like the the invisible side of the
[14:36] Fiat money is like so absurd because
[14:39] your like purchasing power really gets
[14:42] like dried out of you so it's like
[14:45] really dying slow it's like not like
[14:48] dying fast it's not like okay I take the
[14:51] pistol and you're you're dead it's like
[14:53] I'm killing people slowly and that's
[14:55] actually happening right now I mean
[14:58] probably not killing but at least like
[14:59] hurting pretty much the the people and
[15:01] people start to realize oh life gets
[15:03] harder and I need two jobs three jobs
[15:05] four jobs but they don't realize okay
[15:08] maybe the the the foundation of our
[15:10] society is just broken we have broken
[15:12] money and if we have broken money how
[15:15] can we build a prosperous
[15:17] Society it's it's fascinating for me
[15:19] because if if you have inflation and and
[15:21] and the thing is inflating it actually
[15:24] does not really matter if it's like 2 12
[15:27] 20 because it is inflating and you
[15:29] losing purchasing power every and
[15:31] compare that to bitcoin where it's not
[15:33] inflating I mean technically there are
[15:35] new Bitcoin coming in but we have a
[15:37] limit uh and and it's this inflationary
[15:40] uh to use the right term and that's
[15:43] fascinating for me I mean even if you
[15:45] have 2% then your purchasing power is
[15:47] DED out in 35 years so the half life of
[15:50] Fiat is like 35 years if you have like
[15:53] in a good case yeah in a good case if we
[15:55] have like 10% and also there's like
[15:57] there's like inflation and there's like
[15:59] real inflation and there's like asset
[16:01] price inflation so if we have like the
[16:04] the real inflation let's say 10% 15% I
[16:06] mean then your purchasing power is gone
[16:08] in 15 years and 10 years so the half
[16:10] life is more like 10 or 15 years and the
[16:12] half life of Bitcoin is forever what
[16:15] would you say is the most accurate way
[16:16] to actually measure inflation I I really
[16:19] like to use like an S&P 500 or something
[16:21] like that yeah I mean there is not I
[16:23] mean you can do it but I mean if you
[16:26] measure something in in a US dollar
[16:29] terms it's always like distorted so you
[16:33] can kind of you can it's like okay you
[16:35] can try it you can try it but you can
[16:37] never really measure it if you really
[16:39] want to measure inflation then you have
[16:41] to be on a Bitcoin standard and then you
[16:42] can measure how is the Bitcoin inflation
[16:44] I mean it's easy to measure because you
[16:46] know how's the inflation in 100 years
[16:48] how's the inflation in 50 years how's
[16:49] the inflation in 20 years but if you try
[16:51] to measure what's the inflation with
[16:54] Fiat money I mean there is no chance I
[16:56] mean the most accurate way would be to
[16:58] just measure like the the M2 money
[17:00] supply so if you just look like okay
[17:04] today we have like let's say 20 billion
[17:06] dollar notes I mean not dollar notes but
[17:09] let's say we have like 20 billion Let's
[17:11] uh money supply and tomorrow we have
[17:14] like 30 billion money supply then the
[17:16] inflation would be the difference
[17:17] between the 20 and the 30 billion in the
[17:20] money supply so this is probably the
[17:22] most accurate way but what they do like
[17:24] with consumer price in index and then
[17:26] they just take out coffee because coffee
[17:30] is now getting too expensive so we take
[17:31] out the coffee so the numbers look
[17:33] better I mean that's just like
[17:35] gaslighting people uh absolutely and you
[17:38] also uh you you mentioned it before a
[17:40] little bit uh but I really want to get a
[17:42] little bit deeper in that because you
[17:44] took a hotel this was already uh
[17:47] existing it's like you did not found a
[17:49] new Bitcoin Hotel you you took an
[17:50] existing business model uh similar to
[17:53] micro strategy and Michel saor but uh on
[17:56] a different scale of course uh you took
[17:58] a hotel and put put it on a Bitcoin
[17:59] standard uh and I asked you that before
[18:02] but I never covered that on the podcast
[18:04] and I think it would be really
[18:05] interesting what was the main thing that
[18:09] happened I mean uh today uh i l what
[18:11] Michael saor said on the podcast and it
[18:13] is like two episodes back at this point
[18:16] uh and he said like what what changes in
[18:19] society when we have Bitcoin what
[18:21] changes for for companies they like they
[18:23] are getting Immortal because they have a
[18:25] sound monetary uh base where they can
[18:29] actually uh secure the finances and you
[18:31] don't have to struggle they can really
[18:33] build on that and he thinks that
[18:35] companies then will not live uh an
[18:37] average life uh expend of a company
[18:40] right now is 10 years uh if they get
[18:42] over that startup phase uh and uh what
[18:46] what happens when companies all of the
[18:47] sudden get 100 years thousand years
[18:49] because they have a sound money uh
[18:51] really good foundation what what
[18:53] happened in in in Bitcoin Hotel princess
[18:55] blocking I mean that's an interesting
[18:57] question I don't think there will be
[18:59] companies in future which I mean there
[19:02] will always be companies 100e companies
[19:04] 500y year companies we even have this
[19:06] those those today those 100 years
[19:08] companies there will be more but there
[19:11] will not be a lot because at a company
[19:13] you still have like a CEO who can [ __ ]
[19:15] up the company your your business model
[19:17] can run out of yeah can be like poor or
[19:21] or not working anymore so there won't be
[19:24] like a lot of companies which exist like
[19:26] more than 100 years but at least you
[19:29] have the possibility to thrive better
[19:32] because it's like the comparison with
[19:34] like fasting it's like realizing oh I
[19:37] don't have to eat every day because I
[19:39] have so much things stored in my body
[19:41] like in fat cells and everything so I
[19:44] don't have to eat every day I can like
[19:46] go for 30 days I can go for 40 days
[19:48] without eating and it's like the same
[19:50] with Bitcoin when you realize okay I
[19:52] have so much Bitcoin stacked up so even
[19:55] though I don't work today and it's not
[19:57] like for comp not just for a company
[19:59] it's like for an individual it's for a
[20:01] country it's for a company if you have
[20:04] like a Bitcoin stack and the Bitcoin
[20:06] stack gets more and more valuable over
[20:08] the time and even if it's just like one
[20:10] Bitcoin two Bitcoin 10 10 Bitcoin I mean
[20:14] at some point your Bitcoin stack will
[20:16] grow faster than the company is building
[20:21] Revenue at some point your Bitcoin stack
[20:23] is growing faster then you as an
[20:25] individual can earn yeah Revenue or can
[20:29] earn your earnings so this is like the
[20:32] the the game theory of Bitcoin that at
[20:34] some point probably your portfolio makes
[20:37] more gains in one day than you make like
[20:40] uh on a on a month when you when when
[20:43] you go working and then at some point
[20:44] you start to realize oh yeah now I can
[20:47] probably focus on what I really love I
[20:50] don't have to focus so much on what I
[20:52] have to do I have don't have to do 10
[20:53] shops I mean that's like a it depends a
[20:56] lot on your living cost on your yeah how
[20:59] efficient is your company and everything
[21:01] but in theory if Bitcoin goes up forever
[21:03] then at some point there will be like
[21:05] the flippening where your Bitcoin Stak
[21:07] outperforms your company's yeah Revenue
[21:10] stream or your individual Revenue stream
[21:13] or the revenue stream of a country I
[21:15] mean this is like pretty crazy to think
[21:17] about if a country I mean salvad has now
[21:20] 6,000 Bitcoin but imagine if we have
[21:23] like in 20 years and 30 years if we have
[21:25] like a Bitcoin standard I mean the
[21:27] prices will be so high that we don't
[21:29] even have probably Fiat anymore I mean
[21:31] 6,000 Bitcoin I mean that's that's a lot
[21:34] that's a a lot a lot and probably El
[21:37] salador will out compete with other
[21:40] countries and the same goes for
[21:41] companies I mean Michael sailor has now
[21:44] 1% of the Bitcoin Supply with micro
[21:46] strategy imagine in 20 years a Bitcoin
[21:49] standard I mean that's so [ __ ] much
[21:53] Bitcoin I mean even though if they don't
[21:55] work any work anymore I mean they will
[21:57] still out compete other companies even
[22:00] though they don't work anymore yeah
[22:01] Bitcoin becomes a new hurdle rate yeah
[22:04] like when you have an investment I there
[22:05] was a stock investor before we we talked
[22:08] about that and I really loved it like I
[22:10] Lov picking stocks but once I got to
[22:13] bitcoin I was like there there is
[22:15] nothing else like as Mich always said
[22:18] like there is no second best and it's
[22:19] like uh do I really trust that company
[22:22] and even if they're doing what I project
[22:25] them to do there's a CEO that can [ __ ]
[22:27] up anytime there like you you really
[22:29] have to sleep with that and that's why
[22:32] the all the stock people like you have
[22:33] to diversify like of course when you
[22:35] only bet on one company that's that's
[22:37] ridiculous uh especially if you really
[22:40] don't own the company and maybe you're
[22:42] the CEO then it makes sense or you're
[22:44] the found it then then it's like one
[22:46] company uh but uh it's just an
[22:48] individual stock all in in Tesla as I
[22:51] also was uh it's
[22:53] ridiculous at this point now like uh
[22:55] it's interesting to see I mean
[22:57] diversifying is a good idea when there
[23:00] the technnology is not built yet so
[23:03] right now we have like a chair it makes
[23:05] no sense to diversify because we know
[23:06] the chair is working I'm not having like
[23:08] two or three chairs I having like one
[23:10] chair and it's like if you if we look
[23:12] like how technology develops so we can
[23:15] take for example we can take lightning
[23:18] so at first we had like fire we have
[23:20] like candles and this was kind of okay
[23:23] but it was not really perfect because
[23:25] fire was careful and candles were all Al
[23:28] not optimal and so we have like for
[23:30] lightning we used like candles we used
[23:32] fire and at some point there was an
[23:34] engineer and he developed like the
[23:36] electrical light and this was the
[23:38] solution for all the problems and the
[23:40] the the candles and the the fire was
[23:43] like not actually designed for lightning
[23:46] it was like just we took something out
[23:48] of nature which kind of fitted in the
[23:51] probabilities of yeah having light but
[23:53] it was not like the perfect solution but
[23:55] electrical light was the perfect
[23:56] solution because we I mean I mean sure
[23:59] we need electricity but I mean it's way
[24:01] way better than candles and way way
[24:02] better than fire and nowadays everyone
[24:04] uses electrical light no one uses
[24:06] candles I mean some people still but
[24:08] they just use it like more for fun and
[24:10] not like for real use case like most
[24:12] people use electrical light and the same
[24:14] goes for example for information so if
[24:17] you want to transport information I mean
[24:19] we use like uh we use like birds for
[24:22] example we used Birds to transfer
[24:24] information or we used horses or we used
[24:26] letters or we used like yeah fire signs
[24:30] and this all kind of worked but also it
[24:31] was not perfect and in some point there
[24:33] was an engineer and he designed the
[24:35] internet and then we had like the
[24:37] perfect solution we can transfer
[24:39] information immediately always in an
[24:42] instant and this now everyone for Trans
[24:45] transferring information uses the
[24:47] internet because this is just the the
[24:50] perfect solution for this problem and
[24:52] people are problem solvers and at some
[24:55] point there was like Satoshi and Satoshi
[24:57] was the engineer of the store of value
[25:00] problem so we used other things to store
[25:02] our value because the right solution was
[25:05] not developed yet so we used like stocks
[25:07] we used real estate I mean it makes no
[25:09] sense to save your purchasing power in
[25:11] real estate because people use it to
[25:13] living but it was like we took just
[25:16] something out of nature which kind of
[25:17] works but which had not all
[25:20] probabilities of a good store of value
[25:22] so we need like durability scarcity we
[25:25] need like yeah uh it has to be
[25:27] transparent it has has to be uh 24/7
[25:30] available it has to be transferable
[25:32] instant and like all this all this yeah
[25:35] all this
[25:36] probabilities and then Satoshi came and
[25:39] he developed Bitcoin and Bitcoin was
[25:41] just the perfect solution for the store
[25:43] of value problem so the light the
[25:46] electrical light was the solution for
[25:48] like the lightning problem the the
[25:50] lighting problem then where like the
[25:53] internet was the solution for the
[25:55] information problem and Bitcoin is the
[25:57] solution for the store of value problem
[25:59] thank you you already made it halfway
[26:01] through the video and I'm really really
[26:03] grateful to have you here two things
[26:05] make this channel possible you as a
[26:08] watcher and listener who keep supporting
[26:10] this Channel and another one is all the
[26:12] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[26:15] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[26:17] very start and where I personally buy my
[26:19] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[26:21] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[26:23] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[26:27] simplest and sec securest way to secure
[26:29] your Bitcoin and I heard a crazy
[26:31] statistics only 2% of bitcoiners hold
[26:34] their Bitcoin in a hardware wallet how
[26:36] crazy is that don't be in that 98%
[26:40] bracket be in the 2% bracket and if you
[26:42] have self- custody and you know your
[26:44] friend does not have maybe he needs a
[26:46] Christmas present maybe he needs a
[26:47] birthday present and a small life hack
[26:49] if you use code Robin you get 5% off
[26:52] your order plus you support my channel
[26:55] and now let's get back to the video
[26:58] I love it a lot what you're saying it's
[27:00] really cool um and and for me it's like
[27:03] when you get into Bitcoin it's like
[27:05] you're so excited about Bitcoin and
[27:07] you're doing so much stuff in Bitcoin
[27:09] and I'm like why do not more people get
[27:11] it like it seems like we're in a in a
[27:13] bubble and and everything is so great
[27:15] and then you get out like I know I don't
[27:17] want Bitcoin it's for rich people and
[27:19] and you get all this this weird stuff is
[27:21] there um as you have also a lot of
[27:24] experience in in in in speaking with
[27:26] with people and and orange peing people
[27:28] and you have probably also a lot of
[27:29] experience in the hotel also when other
[27:31] people come that are not in Bitcoin uh
[27:34] and then see the the Bitcoin Hotel um
[27:36] what can bitcoiners do to like
[27:39] accelerate Bitcoin adoption like what's
[27:41] the what would you say is like a a good
[27:44] strategy a good uh thing to do as a
[27:46] bitcoiner uh to like not hinder um the
[27:50] the the Bitcoin adoption but accelerate
[27:52] the Bitcoin adoption I think Bitcoin is
[27:54] like a idea and ideas and ideas and and
[28:02] the IDE it's like the perfect IDE in the
[28:04] perfect time and you can't stop an idea
[28:06] which like occurs at like the perfect
[28:09] time so you can do something we can do
[28:10] podcasts but also we could chill at at a
[28:13] beach because the idea is so powerful I
[28:15] mean even though we are not doing
[28:18] anything right now it's like not that
[28:21] Bitcoin needs us but we need Bitcoin so
[28:23] of course I mean it's always
[28:25] interdependent and if we if everyone
[28:27] thinks like that maybe then it won't
[28:29] work but I really think even though if
[28:32] we don't do anything then still the IDE
[28:34] is so powerful that in 50 years 100
[28:38] years I don't know how long it takes but
[28:40] at some point Bitcoin will be like the
[28:42] solution and people will realize Bitcoin
[28:44] is the perfect solution for dollar value
[28:46] Bitcoin is our yeah the best form of
[28:49] money we have and Bitcoin is not just
[28:51] the first cryptocurrency Bitcoin is the
[28:53] last type of money we have like as human
[28:56] Humanity so you can do something but
[28:59] it's more like for your own your benefit
[29:02] so if you live like on a Bitcoin
[29:05] standard then you will benefit if you
[29:07] yeah study Bitcoin then you will benefit
[29:10] if you are around with Bitcoin people
[29:11] then you will benefit if you do a lot of
[29:14] Bitcoin things then you will benefit so
[29:16] if you do something for Bitcoin you will
[29:18] benefit so it's your personal benefit
[29:21] but if you don't do something for
[29:22] Bitcoin then you won't benefit or the
[29:24] benefits will be like way way less but
[29:27] still the idea will like find its way
[29:31] into mainstream and the point of
[29:33] stopping is like over now this was like
[29:35] 10 years ago or something like that or
[29:37] seven or six years ago but nowadays the
[29:39] point of no return is like yeah crossed
[29:42] we're not crossed like the chessum so
[29:45] this is like a concept okay so if we
[29:47] cross the chess then Bitcoin really gets
[29:49] into mainstream that's not happening
[29:51] right now maybe in the cycle maybe next
[29:54] cycle the the the mainstream adoption
[29:56] but the ideas like yeah just just the
[29:59] game T is just in play uh I love it a
[30:03] lot I question myself like you're now
[30:06] having the hotel uh obviously you're not
[30:08] alone in the hotel you're not running
[30:10] your hotel alone but what drives you do
[30:12] like all all those uh Bitcoin content
[30:16] things and it's like like you have a
[30:18] really big YouTube channel and you're
[30:20] doing a lot of videos I I see how much
[30:23] work you actually put in the videos how
[30:25] much work you actually put in the title
[30:26] and the thumbnail and everything is
[30:28] really um um great and you put in a lot
[30:31] of work and love in in the details uh
[30:34] and as you said before we could also
[30:36] just not do anything like Bitcoin
[30:38] doesn't need us um what what still
[30:40] drives you and maybe other bitcoiners to
[30:43] like still do something for Bitcoin I
[30:46] mean it's just Bitcoin is what is super
[30:49] inspiring and it's like fulfilling me
[30:51] completely and it's like everyone has
[30:53] like this inner calling and for me it's
[30:55] like Bitcoin because Bitcoin is really
[30:57] the place where I really see like the
[31:00] possibility to really give Humanity
[31:03] something back I mean I could also do
[31:05] music or I could do other things but I
[31:08] think Bitcoin is the thing which has the
[31:10] biggest lever so I could do for example
[31:12] I could do yoga with the people or could
[31:14] talk about yeah eating healthy or
[31:17] something like that but the lever is not
[31:19] there I mean there is some lever I mean
[31:22] if you talk about healthy living or
[31:24] healthy eating I mean there is some
[31:25] lever but the biggest lever and the
[31:27] thing that really changes humanity is
[31:30] Bitcoin and therefore like this is like
[31:32] yeah because also did other things but
[31:35] it was never so fulfilling because if
[31:37] you don't have sound money then also we
[31:39] don't have sound food if you don't have
[31:40] sound money we don't have a a good
[31:42] school if you don't have sound money
[31:44] then we don't have like uh yeah a good
[31:47] Society if we don't have sound money
[31:48] then we don't have sound or good uh
[31:51] relationships so I could do things about
[31:54] relationships I could do things about
[31:57] health I could do think about yeah
[31:59] living together better or something like
[32:02] that but it makes no sense if there is
[32:05] no sound money and so why not focus on
[32:07] the sound money thing first and if this
[32:10] is fixed then we can go back to living
[32:13] healthy and things like that I mean it's
[32:15] all always important that we also have
[32:17] like other people who have are in other
[32:18] rabbit holes but for me like this makes
[32:22] like that it makes no sense to focus
[32:24] your time and your energy on something
[32:26] else if this is like the solution for at
[32:29] least 50% of the problems we have for
[32:32] Humanity right now
[32:35] uh it's when you said healthy food and I
[32:39] also know you're vegan uh uh are you
[32:42] still yes yeah yeah it's interesting for
[32:44] me because uh I talked with Dan about
[32:47] that in the podcast like bitcoiners are
[32:49] putting too much their own values
[32:52] putting them on bitcoin and then
[32:54] expecting that every Bitcoin is like
[32:56] that it's like oh you have to be kind of
[32:57] were only eating meat otherwise you're
[32:59] not a bitcoiner and I'm like no you can
[33:03] eat whatever you want and then there's
[33:05] like I think we even talked about that
[33:06] when you first interviewed me in in
[33:08] German we're like we should agree on
[33:11] stuff we should like we should focus on
[33:13] the commonalities uh in the Bitcoin
[33:16] Community do do you think that the
[33:18] Bitcoin Community sometimes especially
[33:19] on Twitter is too toxic and too uh
[33:23] frightening especially for normous the
[33:25] big problem is we're not focusing on
[33:27] what unites us we're focus is FOC
[33:30] focusing us on what's separating us and
[33:33] this is like every happening everywhere
[33:36] not just in the Bitcoin space in other
[33:38] spaces it's way way worse so that's also
[33:40] like a strategy to yeah to govern people
[33:43] I mean if you don't can yeah if you
[33:46] don't have like good Solutions then just
[33:48] like let the people fight against each
[33:50] other so they don't fight against the
[33:52] government so and this is like happening
[33:54] everywhere and I mean you know we have
[33:56] so much in common so we all hairs we are
[33:58] all human beings we are all like yeah we
[34:01] have all blood we have all like our
[34:03] organs there is like 1 million like
[34:06] things who are pretty similar and then
[34:09] we focus on the one thing so you eat
[34:11] beef and I eat like plants I eat like
[34:14] fruits or vegetables or whatever and
[34:16] another guy eats like meat and then we
[34:18] focus okay what separates us and it's
[34:20] like one point out of million points who
[34:23] separates us and we're focusing on this
[34:25] one point this is this makes no sense
[34:27] and this is like like this this the
[34:29] monkey brain we we are really like uh
[34:32] yeah caught in our monkey brain so we
[34:34] lose the yeah the the connection to our
[34:38] inner self and when we lose the
[34:40] connection to our inner self we also
[34:41] lose the connection to our neighbors to
[34:42] our friends to our best friends because
[34:45] in the end it's all an illusion there is
[34:48] no you and I there is like one yeah
[34:52] great I don't know how to say I mean
[34:54] some people say like there is like one
[34:56] Universe We Are All One you can say
[34:58] whatever you want but there is no
[35:00] separation the separation is just in
[35:02] your in your head and this is what
[35:05] people don't realize and then they focus
[35:06] on the on the on what separates us
[35:08] instead of reminding us okay what
[35:11] connects us and this is also what's
[35:13] healing if we realize hey we are
[35:14] connected if your life is better my life
[35:17] is better if my life is better your life
[35:19] is better and if we use Bitcoin both of
[35:21] our Lives is better is is that a thing
[35:23] that could actually happen and and unite
[35:25] the global uh sphere a little bit more
[35:28] when we have all the same money or the
[35:31] same way of storing money I mean even
[35:34] like we're now in Czech you're from
[35:36] Germany I'm from Austria uh and we use
[35:39] different currencies like Austria and
[35:41] Germany the same currency but in Czech
[35:43] we use a different currency uh even
[35:44] though we are so close to each other uh
[35:47] and is is that something that Bitcoin
[35:50] could actually unite us again yes
[35:52] exactly or otherwise you could say fat
[35:54] is separating us I mean for example for
[35:57] example
[35:58] I mean if you look like what type of
[36:01] countries are making War I mean there is
[36:03] always like religion type of Wars but if
[36:05] we look like there is like religion Wars
[36:08] and there is currency Wars and it makes
[36:10] no sense that Germany is attacking
[36:12] France because they have the same
[36:14] currency they AR like in the same in the
[36:16] same currency room it also makes no
[36:18] sense that Italy Italy attacks Spain or
[36:21] Germany fights against yeah Spain or
[36:24] something like that but when we see like
[36:26] War happening it's always okay the US
[36:28] the US dollar is attacking the Euro or
[36:31] the euro is attacking the the ruble or
[36:33] the ruble is attacking the chin H the
[36:35] ruble is attacking the dollar so it's
[36:37] always like those different currency
[36:39] rooms fighting against each other and if
[36:42] you realize that and also like in a
[36:43] world scenario it's always about which
[36:46] type of currency is inflating the
[36:49] slowest so you're buying weapons you're
[36:52] fighting against each other you have to
[36:54] inflate your currency and the biggest
[36:57] room
[36:58] the biggest currency room can yeah has
[37:00] the big biggest benefit of like the the
[37:03] money the money monopol and so the side
[37:07] wins which has like the yeah sometimes
[37:10] the biggest currency room and the side
[37:13] wins inflates the money the yeah
[37:16] actually the slowest and then this is
[37:19] like the question okay in a Bitcoin
[37:21] standard maybe it makes no sense that
[37:23] China attacks the us because they all
[37:26] have like the same Curren room and okay
[37:29] there could be like some religious type
[37:31] of fights but I mean also it's like
[37:34] super hard in a in a Bitcoin standard to
[37:37] finance War because there is no money
[37:39] printer and how do we Finance Wars
[37:40] without money printer do do you think
[37:43] that Bitcoin bring peace brings peace uh
[37:45] Bitcoin does not bring peace Bitcoin is
[37:48] peace Bitcoin is like the freedom
[37:50] technology we waited like all the way I
[37:52] once heard Max kaon it's going a bit too
[37:54] far but he has kind of a point in what
[37:57] he's saying he's saying uh God brought
[37:59] us Jesus and it this did not solve peace
[38:03] in the world this did not bring peace to
[38:05] the world now Satoshi brings us Bitcoin
[38:07] Miners and Bitcoin notes and this will
[38:09] bring us peace I mean it's a bit too far
[38:12] I know I know but there is some truth in
[38:14] it because this is like the freedom
[38:16] technology which unites us and which
[38:19] does not separate us it's like slay Your
[38:21] Heroes and we have transparent money
[38:24] with have decentralized money there is
[38:26] no Governor there is no no lagard
[38:28] there's no cheron Paul there is just
[38:30] like transparent rules and if you want
[38:32] to play with the rules then join Bitcoin
[38:36] and if not then have fun staying poor
[38:38] it's also interesting how uh people
[38:42] connect uh Bitcoin and religion so much
[38:45] like I I hear that so many times and I I
[38:47] interviewed people like uh the the guy
[38:49] from the Bitcoin Bible who connects
[38:52] Christianity with Bitcoin and and and
[38:54] says that all all that stuff um do you
[38:57] you also like uh see it sometimes as a
[39:00] is there connection or do you see like
[39:02] ah it's money and the religion is it
[39:03] doesn't make sense people just put the
[39:05] value into that I mean yes and no I mean
[39:08] it depends like how you how the
[39:10] definition of a religion is I mean in my
[39:13] definition a religion is you trust
[39:16] something which you did not
[39:22] uh how do you say how do say
[39:25] which yeah you trust something you
[39:28] cannot verify so there is like and it
[39:30] religion can be like everything religion
[39:32] can be science so nowadays the religion
[39:35] is Not Like Jesus Anymore or something
[39:36] like that it's like the science and you
[39:38] have to trust the science and this is
[39:40] like the religion or religion can also
[39:42] be like there is like one guy and he's
[39:44] saying like do this and this and this
[39:45] and just believe and if you do this and
[39:47] this then you go to heaven and if do bad
[39:49] things then you go to hell and it's like
[39:51] believing into
[39:53] something and Bitcoin is not believing
[39:56] into something Bitcoin is like don't
[39:59] trust verify it's like you can verify
[40:01] like how are the rules how is the the
[40:04] inflation going on how is the money uh
[40:07] yeah how is the money inflating how is
[40:09] how is everything going how is it's a
[40:12] completely transparent system you can
[40:13] even check the the source code you can
[40:15] check everything and in a religion to
[40:18] some point you can check things but at
[40:20] some point you have to start believing
[40:22] and in Bitcoin you can come to the place
[40:25] where you don't have to believe anymore
[40:28] you can come to a place where you can
[40:30] realize and this is also like the the
[40:33] next thing so if you're like into uh
[40:36] awareness or into spir spirituality I
[40:38] mean you can believe in a God you can
[40:40] believe in you can believe in a in Lions
[40:43] or you can believe in cats or in animals
[40:45] or you can believe in everything you can
[40:46] believe in science or whatever but at
[40:49] some point if you make like inner work
[40:51] you can come to a place where it's not
[40:54] like believing that I believe we are all
[40:57] not separate and we are all one it's not
[41:00] about believing it's about realizing you
[41:02] can come to a place where you realize
[41:03] hey it's really not a separation there
[41:05] is no separation We Are All One Piece we
[41:08] are all together one yeah Humanity
[41:11] family or whatever you want to call it
[41:14] and the same goes for Bitcoin at some
[41:16] point you don't have to trust or you
[41:18] don't have to believe anymore you can
[41:21] just realize and this is like the big
[41:22] big change and also like I'm not really
[41:25] so much a fan of religion because I mean
[41:28] it's a good tool to like to like govern
[41:32] like whole groups of people because I
[41:34] mean that's all almost or not always
[41:37] what we did with religion but a lot a
[41:39] big part was like how can we govern like
[41:42] a lot of people we just give them like
[41:44] some things and we just spread them to
[41:46] the people you have to do this and this
[41:48] and then that is good and if you do this
[41:49] and this then that this is bad and so
[41:52] you can govern a lot PE of people and
[41:53] then you you make them yeah you you make
[41:56] them get get yeah uh frightened because
[42:00] they think okay if I do the bad things
[42:01] then I will go to hell and if I do the
[42:03] good things then I will go to to heaven
[42:05] and you just it's like in media it's
[42:07] happening right now if if you do the bad
[42:10] things then you will bad things will
[42:12] happen to you and if you do good things
[42:14] good things will happen to you and
[42:15] that's like how yeah people are governed
[42:19] it's like about fear and it's about yeah
[42:22] giving them like like like morality and
[42:25] then saying okay that's not moral and
[42:27] that's good that's bad and but actually
[42:30] there is in my opinion there is no need
[42:34] for
[42:35] this is is that uh sometimes I think
[42:38] like is that in human nature and will
[42:41] like because when you see the media is
[42:43] like always like this really bad things
[42:46] are really blown up uh and then when you
[42:48] look at the facts okay yeah it's it's
[42:49] not that bad uh and and I mean it
[42:52] happens also on YouTube it it's not just
[42:54] mainstreaming like things uh uh you make
[42:58] things worse or better uh to make some
[43:01] excitement around it uh and and and and
[43:05] I think that's just in in in human
[43:06] nature but is there some some intention
[43:08] behind that you think that there like
[43:10] this this divide and conquer kind of a
[43:13] thing whereas like do you do you do you
[43:15] see that in any way shape or form to be
[43:17] honest I don't know I mean I don't think
[43:20] that human beings are like Evil by
[43:23] default I think human beings are just
[43:26] neutral and then that there are like
[43:29] different layers like just like first
[43:31] layer second layer third layer the first
[43:33] layer in my opinion is always like we
[43:35] are Divine beings we are just poor love
[43:37] we are just poor peace but at some point
[43:40] our ego gets involved and then we think
[43:43] like we are separated and then then we
[43:44] think like we have to steal from other
[43:46] people so our lives get better but this
[43:48] is like nonsense but really the core is
[43:51] like not evil but lots of people are
[43:54] like really drifted away from their
[43:56] source and they're they're not connected
[43:58] with their inner peace anymore so that's
[44:00] like where the chaos comes in and then
[44:02] we have like other Egos and then the
[44:04] egos killing each other and this is just
[44:07] the surface of the universe so if you
[44:10] just go all the way back then there is
[44:12] no killing or there is no war or
[44:15] something like that there is always
[44:17] peace and yeah so I'm not so sure if
[44:21] like the politicians if they are Super
[44:23] Evil I mean some of them probably are
[44:26] but lot of them are always yeah they're
[44:30] incentivized by wrong incentives so we
[44:33] have like a really bad incentive
[44:35] structure because nowadays politicians
[44:38] they can just print money and your
[44:41] children my children or whatever
[44:42] children they have to pay like for the
[44:45] debt they're making now so it's just
[44:47] like the incentives are so bad that
[44:51] politicians are Al all almost
[44:54] incentivized to do bad decisions because
[44:56] also so they don't have to I I don't
[44:59] know the English word they don't have to
[45:01] uh
[45:03] hon uh they don't have to um wow I also
[45:08] don't know they don't they don't have
[45:10] there there is no judgment for the
[45:11] decisions so if there no consequences
[45:13] yeah there's no consequences exactly
[45:15] there's there's no consequences I mean
[45:16] you can print money and then in two
[45:19] years you're not on power anymore and
[45:21] the society has to live with the
[45:23] consequences but you don't have to live
[45:25] with the consequences or you're a big
[45:26] bang you can do whatever you want and
[45:28] then you get a bailout and you don't
[45:30] have to live with the consequences if
[45:31] you're a small business you have to live
[45:33] with the consequences if you're in in
[45:35] wiow will you have to live with the
[45:36] consequences but if you're too big to
[45:38] fail you don't have to live with the
[45:40] consequences and this is like not a good
[45:42] incentive this is a really really bad
[45:44] incentive structure and this also makes
[45:47] people evil I mean they are not evil by
[45:50] default but the incentives make them
[45:52] evil and that's like the the the
[45:55] actually that's probably the whole
[45:57] magic it's uh it's a fascinating topic
[46:01] when when we go get in in in this whole
[46:03] thing uh but to come closer to the end
[46:06] now I have uh always two things in the
[46:09] end I have one thing that is kind of in
[46:11] the new end routin and then the the
[46:13] question from the previous guest uh the
[46:15] first question for me is and I always do
[46:17] that because I want to learn I want to
[46:19] give a platform where we can learn from
[46:21] other bitcoiners not about Bitcoin
[46:24] that's why I'm always asking what are
[46:25] you currently deeply passionate about uh
[46:28] deeply learning about which has nothing
[46:31] to do with Bitcoin or it's not Bitcoin
[46:33] because everything has a little bit to
[46:34] do with Bitcoin mhm I mean what's super
[46:37] interesting for me is always like
[46:39] awareness so lots of people think like
[46:42] okay this type of being like in a hustle
[46:46] and working and yeah surviving this is
[46:49] life but there is so much more to life
[46:52] there is I mean your awareness can just
[46:54] open up and this is like just
[46:57] super inspiring to just go within and
[47:00] realize okay what is actually reality
[47:04] about so is it like just about surviving
[47:06] is it just about like paying bills is it
[47:09] just about Bitcoin is it just about
[47:10] money is it just about getting rich or
[47:12] is there m to it and also like health is
[47:15] a big thing and this is connected if
[47:16] you're not healthy then also your
[47:18] Consciousness will not open up and the
[47:20] next thing is also like Longevity if
[47:23] you're not living like a healthy
[47:25] lifestyle then you're not living long
[47:28] you're not living a good life quality
[47:30] and probably also your awareness will be
[47:32] bad so everything is interconnected if
[47:35] you're living healthier you're making
[47:37] better decisions you have a better life
[47:38] you have a better lifestyle you have
[47:41] better habits uh you will live longer
[47:44] you live better and you probably have a
[47:47] more open awareness and things are just
[47:50] yeah better for you and this is like the
[47:52] biggest rabbit hole in the world not
[47:54] money but like to ask yourself so who is
[47:58] the person experiencing experiencing
[48:01] every Everything who's the person
[48:03] talking here with you who's the person
[48:05] thinking who's the person experiencing
[48:08] who's the person feeling and if you
[48:10] don't have answers to this basically
[48:13] your whole you're missing the point of
[48:15] life because if you work the whole life
[48:18] but you don't
[48:19] realize who is working if you talk the
[48:22] whole life but you're not realizing who
[48:24] is talking if you're thinking the whole
[48:26] life but you're not realizing who
[48:28] thinking then I mean probably it's not
[48:30] missing the point completely but at
[48:33] least if you're come to the conclusion
[48:35] okay now I I probably at am at a point
[48:38] where I I realize hey I'm Not My
[48:40] Thoughts I'm not my emotions I'm not my
[48:43] job I'm not my money I'm not the Bitcoin
[48:45] I mean then life gets just pretty
[48:47] awesome because then you're not attached
[48:49] to bitcoin anymore you're not attached
[48:50] to your living experience here anymore
[48:53] you're not attached to your body anymore
[48:54] and if you're not to attached to your
[48:56] body to your emotions to your feelings
[48:58] then you're Al also not suffering
[48:59] anymore because suffering comes when
[49:02] people attach to things which are by
[49:05] Nature impermanent because everything is
[49:07] impermanent here the chair is
[49:09] impermanent your body is impermanent the
[49:11] house is impermanent everything will die
[49:13] at some point even Bitcoin Mich saor
[49:15] says Bitcoin is forever this is not true
[49:17] Bitcoin has an end at some point at
[49:19] least if the Sun implodes or something
[49:21] like that at some point there is an end
[49:23] everything is impermanent also your
[49:26] human exper appearence is impermanent
[49:27] but if you cling to things if you attach
[49:29] to things which are by their
[49:31] nature impermanent then suffering is
[49:34] guaranteed and why suffer if you can be
[49:36] free that's why I love that question so
[49:38] much it brings so many new topics on um
[49:42] I have for the end routine unfortunately
[49:44] I think I was overwhelmed with the Mich
[49:46] interview because I always ask my guest
[49:48] for like the next question but I forgot
[49:50] to ask maror that question and I forgot
[49:53] also m z the the treasure C to ask the
[49:57] question that you would have gotten now
[49:59] so I want actually for today like just
[50:02] as a uh to turn this a little bit around
[50:05] uh do it while we're recording do you
[50:08] already have a question or like do you
[50:10] have a question that you would like to
[50:12] ask the next guest uh and then we can
[50:14] quickly discuss that and and wrap the
[50:16] podcast up yeah so the question would
[50:19] be do you think it's possible to I mean
[50:24] okay we are I mean it's a it's a
[50:26] question of my position I'm now 32 years
[50:28] old and for me the question the
[50:31] interesting question is because people
[50:32] say okay you can live like 80 years 100
[50:35] years but I think you're Al always like
[50:39] uh yeah you're always like creating your
[50:41] own life and if you think like okay 80
[50:43] years is like a lifespan 100 years is a
[50:46] lifespan I think you're limiting
[50:48] yourself so the question would be is it
[50:50] possible to live until you're until the
[50:54] last Bitcoin is mine this is 2,130
[50:57] and and this is like lots of people
[50:59] think I'm crazy when I say like I can
[51:02] live till I'm till the year 2002
[51:06] 2,140 but in my opinion this is not
[51:08] crazy it's just about yeah opening your
[51:12] mindset and also like lots of things
[51:15] will develop I mean longevity there is
[51:17] so much things happening and everything
[51:19] and also like it's about creating a life
[51:23] with good habits and I think it's not
[51:25] it's not a stupid stupid idea to live
[51:27] till the year
[51:29] 2,140 and even if you're just born today
[51:31] I mean 2,140 this would be like 120
[51:34] years living horizont and in my opinion
[51:38] this is not something crazy this is
[51:40] probably something achievable so the
[51:43] question would be is it possible to live
[51:45] till the last Bitcoin is
[51:47] mind
[51:49] that's I think actually yes like I think
[51:52] uh probably as a human nature we
[51:55] probably figure out uh at maybe at some
[51:58] point to extend the
[52:00] life further and further because like
[52:04] people when the life expectancy was uh
[52:07] 30 people was like I never someone lives
[52:10] till 100 but people actually now live
[52:13] till 100 and it gets more and more
[52:15] normal and I think we just expand I
[52:18] don't know if we can expand till uh
[52:20] infinity at some point or can like I
[52:22] don't know upload our brain in in some
[52:24] virtual reality and it's like I
[52:27] this a whole another topic of discussion
[52:30] uh but I I think we we we we could make
[52:35] it this would make me uh 142 years old
[52:40] uh at at that point that that would make
[52:42] me uh definitely an old man uh and yeah
[52:47] I'm I'm glad that I'm even 25 years old
[52:49] because a lot of people uh never get to
[52:52] that point if you think about that kind
[52:53] of stuff I never actually like had the
[52:56] thought in my head of I want to live as
[52:59] long as I can like I never have this I
[53:01] mean also like don't get confused it's
[53:03] not about living as long as you can
[53:04] because if you're living a [ __ ] up
[53:06] life and you're like living 200 years in
[53:08] a [ __ ] up life I mean there's no point
[53:10] about living I mean it's always about
[53:12] improving the quality of your life and
[53:14] if you're improving the quality of your
[53:16] life the side effect will be you're
[53:17] living longer if you're healthier you're
[53:19] living longer if you're having like
[53:20] better habits you have a better life
[53:22] right now but the side effect will be
[53:23] you're living longer if you have better
[53:25] relationships you're having a better
[53:27] life right now but the side effect will
[53:28] be you're living longer yeah and if you
[53:30] Bitcoin if you have Bitcoin you have a
[53:33] better life right now but the side
[53:34] effect will be you're living longer
[53:36] because Society also I mean we never
[53:38] thought about what happens to society if
[53:40] we're like on a good hard money standard
[53:43] if we have like sound money I mean even
[53:46] just having like Bitcoin sound money I
[53:48] mean this could probably just extend
[53:50] like our life expectancy 10 years 20
[53:53] years whatever I mean if you don't have
[53:55] wars anymore if you're not killing each
[53:57] other anymore if we're more united I
[54:00] mean life expectances goes
[54:06] up life will be expended to Infinity
[54:08] that's the title yeah yeah probably not
[54:11] probably not I'm not sure yeah but yeah
[54:14] because I mean everything is impermanent
[54:16] there is nothing nothing
[54:18] infinite I mean there is some in some
[54:21] infinity points I mean stupidity is
[54:23] probably infinite and also like some
[54:26] people would say the the universe is
[54:28] infinite and money printing is infinite
[54:31] at least right now but at some point
[54:33] probably it will end hope but that's
[54:35] things also we don't know and also I say
[54:38] okay I don't know everything and but I
[54:40] don't I know that I don't know
[54:41] everything and therefore I know
[54:43] stupidity is infinite uh that's an
[54:46] amazing point to end the podcast Before
[54:49] I Let You Go uh where can people find
[54:51] you where can people find your podcast
[54:53] where can people find uh and where
[54:56] actually can people also ask you
[54:57] question like and reach out to you yes
[54:59] so you can check out our Bitcoin yeah
[55:03] YouTube channel Bitcoin hotel in YouTube
[55:06] but it's a German channel so maybe you
[55:08] have to translate something or you just
[55:11] yeah skip it if you can't can't
[55:13] understand but probably in one or two
[55:15] years AI will be like so far that
[55:17] probably it's like Auto translated or
[55:19] something like that I'm pretty sure so
[55:21] therefore I'm also probably not
[55:23] switching on English content because I
[55:24] think at some point AI will just do it
[55:26] yeah yeah and then you can check out in
[55:29] X you can check out Bitcoin Hotel there
[55:31] you will find everything and also if you
[55:33] want to visit a bit Hotel on a Bitcoin
[55:35] standard with like we have lots of
[55:37] Bitcoin conferences there we have like
[55:39] lots of Bitcoin things happening over
