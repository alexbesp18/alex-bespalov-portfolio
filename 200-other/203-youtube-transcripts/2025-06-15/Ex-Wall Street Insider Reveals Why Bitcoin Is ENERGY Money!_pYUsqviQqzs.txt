[00:00] when you think about everything is
[00:01] energy and frequency we are
[00:02] bioelectrical beings so everything is
[00:05] energy and frequency and Bitcoin it's
[00:07] energy money this neutral Global money
[00:10] is going to enable and promote the
[00:12] cooperation and peace that is coming in
[00:14] this new period so I had that whole
[00:16] financial Tech financial background and
[00:18] then I had a lot of intuitive energetic
[00:21] bioenergetic training and experience in
[00:24] my private practice and if you expand
[00:26] that into even a more Global or even
[00:29] more Cosmic perspective we are in the
[00:31] midst of a massive Global transformation
[00:35] a really a radical paradigm shift and
[00:37] it's more of like an evolutionary leap
[00:40] as humans so decentralization equality
[00:43] individual sovereignty Global borderless
[00:46] truth transparency all of the qualities
[00:49] of Bitcoin are also totally in alignment
[00:51] with where we're
[00:52] [Music]
[00:56] headed how did you get get started with
[00:58] Bitcoin and also um you you wrote the
[01:02] note uh to me like how Bitcoin relates
[01:04] to how did you say like the the
[01:06] transformation of Consciousness or
[01:08] something like that uh which is super
[01:10] interesting how did you get started with
[01:12] Bitcoin and how did you find the
[01:13] connection there also yeah exactly well
[01:16] as as we were just talking about in the
[01:18] little bit of an intro you know most
[01:20] people are talking about the financial
[01:21] aspect of Bitcoin the price predictions
[01:24] you know how to accumulate it how to
[01:26] live or retire on it you know what uh
[01:28] you know what going all in on it means
[01:31] and like you know how much of the $900
[01:32] trillion doll asset Market will it
[01:34] capture and selling your house or your
[01:36] real estate portfolio and you know
[01:38] liquidating Financial portfolios and the
[01:40] collapse of Fiat and all this kind of
[01:43] you know first world uh focuses focusing
[01:46] on bitcoin of you know of number go up
[01:48] and of course energy optimization human
[01:51] rights you know Global Financial Freedom
[01:53] but I really look at it from I look at
[01:55] it from that perspective and I'll tell
[01:57] you a little bit of my background in a
[01:58] minute and I also look at it from a very
[02:00] different perspective and Bitcoin is
[02:03] truly a change agent for growth inner
[02:07] growth and external growth many people
[02:09] have experienced that you know that
[02:11] moment that changed
[02:13] everything uh the realization of what
[02:15] Bitcoin is and they're kind of you know
[02:17] blew the top of their head off and what
[02:19] it means for you personally but also
[02:21] what it means for the
[02:22] planet and for those that experience it
[02:25] kind of at the personal level it
[02:27] frequently moves them into a time
[02:30] preference right and they gain Clarity
[02:33] around and make new choices around
[02:35] health and lifestyle and relationships
[02:38] and family and home and education and
[02:41] even Community the people they want to
[02:43] be hanging with and they end up um
[02:46] valuing or clarifying their values
[02:49] around generosity and integrity and um
[02:55] collaboration and communication and
[02:56] realizing the importance of personal
[03:00] sovereignty on nearly every level in
[03:03] their
[03:04] life and if you expand that into uh even
[03:08] a more Global or even more Cosmic
[03:11] perspective we are in the midst of a
[03:15] massive Global transformation a really a
[03:18] radical paradigm shift and it's more of
[03:21] like an evolutionary leap as humans and
[03:24] I'll talk a little bit more about the
[03:25] specifics of that later um but Bitcoin
[03:29] is going to provide a financial a social
[03:32] and also a spiritual Foundation of a
[03:35] radically new era that we are
[03:39] entering people talk about how um you
[03:42] know will this be like the development
[03:44] or the adoption of the internet and this
[03:46] transformation that we're in is going to
[03:48] be way bigger and way more profound so
[03:53] you asked me how did I how did I get
[03:55] into this and let me kind of back up a
[03:57] little bit and explore a little bit of
[03:59] how I got that
[04:01] realization I think I've been I don't
[04:03] know if it's orange pilled twice but
[04:05] like red pilled and then orange pilled
[04:06] in my life so I have had a I've had a
[04:10] life that's that's contained a really
[04:12] broad range of um different careers and
[04:16] experiences big zigs and zags throughout
[04:19] my life I mean when I was younger I was
[04:21] in the arts dance and and the Arts and
[04:25] living in New York I realized I couldn't
[04:26] live on that kind of salary so I had to
[04:28] get into something that was going to be
[04:30] a little more lucrative so I uh I joined
[04:33] a a primary dealer and uh became a fixed
[04:37] income Trader on Wall Street for several
[04:40] years and then I wasn't you know when
[04:42] you've got 50 hundred million doll
[04:44] trades on you know I wasn't sleeping at
[04:46] night so I ended up teaching myself
[04:49] computer languages and moving into
[04:51] technology and developing Trader
[04:53] workstation software and the things that
[04:55] I needed and I ended up U as head of
[04:58] tech support for one of the hottest
[05:00] computer companies at the time that was
[05:02] just coming into Wall Street Sun
[05:04] Microsystems uh some people have heard
[05:06] of that so I ended up as as head of tech
[05:08] support for Manhattan for sun
[05:10] Microsystems and I got hired away of as
[05:12] um by American Express as director of
[05:14] corporate technology strategy so that
[05:16] was kind of like my you know Tech and
[05:19] finance corporate
[05:21] career and I had this red pill moment
[05:25] where I realized what the Matrix was
[05:27] that is Corporate America and had an
[05:30] event that a personal event that just
[05:31] really woke me up to what is reality and
[05:34] it did a little bit of a rad pull for me
[05:37] on on what's real what is real and I
[05:41] realized through this event that
[05:43] everything is energy that we Are
[05:46] Spiritual Beings having a human
[05:48] experience and we are way bigger than
[05:50] this three-dimensional Human Experience
[05:54] and I just I started exploring I started
[05:57] meditating and you know exploring a
[06:00] whole bunch of different options and I
[06:02] just couldn't continue in my corporate
[06:03] job so I ended up leaving it and really
[06:07] that was that event kind of did a 180
[06:09] degree shift in my life and I started
[06:12] exploring new directions that were much
[06:14] more in the energetic and spiritual
[06:17] Realms so for the last few decades what
[06:20] I've really been focusing on is um
[06:23] supporting deep personal growth for
[06:26] clients through a private Consulting
[06:27] practice making use of uh Advanced
[06:30] bioenergetic therapeutic methods and you
[06:34] know for my clients and then for me
[06:35] exploring spirituality and Consciousness
[06:37] at many many different levels so and
[06:39] that route has led me way far out beyond
[06:42] the Leading Edge of the normal
[06:44] three-dimensional reality
[06:46] Paradigm so I ended up getting certified
[06:49] in seven different seven different seven
[06:51] it's like the the uh seven dos I can
[06:54] never remember all seven of them
[06:57] but um but I got certified sever
[07:00] different um growth and healing methods
[07:02] and systems um and did a lot of Zan and
[07:06] S yoga meditation multi-day Retreats
[07:08] over you know and contributed chapters
[07:11] to two books and had a nationwide radio
[07:13] show Nationwide online radio show um
[07:16] that interviewing thought leaders in the
[07:19] space at the time around creativity and
[07:21] energy medicine
[07:22] epigenetics and throughout my life I've
[07:26] had this unique ability to access kind
[07:29] of both sides of my brain really easily
[07:31] the left linear analytical logical side
[07:34] and the right holistic creative
[07:36] intuitive mind it's almost like a bridge
[07:39] brain you know that that I can move
[07:41] easily between the two and it allows me
[07:44] to kind of recognize nonobvious
[07:46] connections quickly and intuitively so I
[07:50] had that whole financial Tech financial
[07:51] background and then I had a lot of of
[07:54] intuitive energetic bioenergetic um
[07:57] training and experience in my private
[08:00] practice so Bitcoin how does Bitcoin
[08:03] come into all
[08:05] this um I was introduced to bitcoin by a
[08:09] friend of mine in 2017 and I I swear
[08:12] because I think people who have a Tekken
[08:15] a finance background have a harder time
[08:17] actually accepting it I totally
[08:19] dismissed it right I just said you know
[08:22] I know what money is this isn't money
[08:24] right this can't be money uh I totally
[08:26] discounted it because of that Financial
[08:29] Training an experience and then um
[08:32] nearly almost exactly four years ago
[08:34] February of
[08:36] 21 I heard um the Michael sailor Ross
[08:40] Stevens hourlong interview um was
[08:43] Michael sailor interviewing Ross I think
[08:44] during the uh Bitcoin for corporations
[08:48] conference that sailor was putting on
[08:50] and um I assume you know who Ross
[08:52] Stevens is are you fam yeah you know
[08:55] chairman of executive chair of of [ __ ]
[08:57] New York digital Investment Group and
[08:59] CEO of Stone Ridge brilliant he's This
[09:01] brilliant to sailor PhD in
[09:04] finance and I I saw this hourlong
[09:07] interview and all of a sudden like just
[09:11] all of a sudden all the pieces just fell
[09:13] into place you know the tech the finance
[09:15] the spiritual the the energetic like
[09:17] where this whole thing was going like a
[09:19] strong intuitive hit on what Bitcoin was
[09:22] and where it was going so I got the tech
[09:25] piece I got the financial piece I got
[09:27] the energetic spiritual aspects of it
[09:29] and and I got this huge intuitive hit
[09:31] about the role it was going to play in
[09:34] the global change that was emerging I
[09:37] mean it wasn't it wasn't the kind of
[09:39] lifechanging Awakening that so many
[09:41] bitcoiners have when they're orange
[09:44] pilled it's it's almost more like um the
[09:48] last puzzle piece fell into place to
[09:51] support the massive Global
[09:53] transformation that I was already aware
[09:54] of that we were already on the brink of
[09:57] so internally I had this feeling of like
[09:59] oh yes that's the piece that was missing
[10:03] so I kind of came at it you know from
[10:04] another from the backside right rather
[10:06] than having the orange pill moment going
[10:08] Bitcoin it was like almost like I was
[10:10] hunting for this piece and then that
[10:11] last piece that was Bitcoin fell into
[10:13] place and I went oh got it so I had the
[10:16] kind of U it's like i' been living the
[10:19] same realizations that bitcoiners get to
[10:21] about personal sovereignty and what's
[10:23] important and their values for years um
[10:26] and I've been living my life from that
[10:28] level of clarity
[10:30] um and I'm still learning and releasing
[10:32] old patterns and you know growing and
[10:34] understanding of how the cosmos is
[10:36] evolving but I basically been on that
[10:38] path for quite a while so discovering
[10:41] Bitcoin was like was like the Capstone
[10:45] you know on something rather than a door
[10:47] opening so it was like a mini orange
[10:49] pill experience uh rather than the big
[10:52] one that most people get because I'd
[10:54] already been living a lot of the the uh
[10:56] values you know that bitcoiners uh move
[10:59] towards as they get into
[11:01] Bitcoin so since 2021 I've you know
[11:05] stack of books stack of books back there
[11:08] thousands of hours of podcasts thank
[11:10] goodness for podcasts my goodness
[11:12] they're amazing and you know in 21
[11:14] hundreds of hours in clubhouse were you
[11:16] ever on clubhouse so listening to you
[11:20] know American hodle and I mean just all
[11:22] the folks that were on clubhous you know
[11:23] during those days and um I kept getting
[11:27] the same questions
[11:29] um from people I would I would try an
[11:32] orange pill so I ended up developing an
[11:36] online class called Bitcoin curious and
[11:38] you know in 75 minutes covered what is
[11:41] money how is it broken you know how does
[11:44] Bitcoin fix this what's the fud you'll
[11:47] encounter where's Bitcoin headed and how
[11:49] do it get safely started with it and you
[11:52] know did that for a couple of years and
[11:53] then a little over a year
[11:55] ago I was invited to join the Bitcoin
[11:58] adviser and I know you're familiar with
[12:00] them because you have had a number of
[12:03] we've got 40 Global advisers and you
[12:05] have had dab and and Luke BRS and Peter
[12:08] dunworth and SE Bunny and you know
[12:10] Freddy new I think you know on your on
[12:13] your podcast it's it's a phenomenal team
[12:15] we got hot onnut and new Sanol and
[12:18] Christa Edmonds you know of access tribe
[12:20] Surfer Jim everybody knows Surfer Jim
[12:22] right teren Michael who wrote uh proof
[12:24] of money so it's a phenomenal team and
[12:28] we're helping folks purchase manage and
[12:31] secure their Bitcoin get it off
[12:33] exchanges and eliminate themselves as
[12:35] the single point of failure uh through
[12:39] multi- collaborative custody and uh
[12:42] Estate Planning and Tax Strategies and
[12:45] education so you know I've been really
[12:48] involved in that over the past year in
[12:50] addition to you know my private private
[12:52] orange pilling of
[12:54] folks um it's interesting how um a lot
[12:59] of people talk about you have to have an
[13:01] ego death to really hoddle Bitcoin you
[13:03] know you have to just get your ego out
[13:04] of the way and it's almost like I
[13:07] experienced that ego death years and
[13:09] years ago during my whole transformation
[13:12] you know a couple decades ago and I have
[13:14] such utter confidence in what Bitcoin is
[13:18] huddling it is like the easiest thing in
[13:19] the world I mean I love watching or the
[13:21] prices what is it you know 845 right now
[13:24] I'm like Yay let's stack some more you
[13:27] know it's just it's so easy just to hold
[13:30] it I've never been tempted at all to
[13:32] sell any and this and when I joined in
[13:35] you know joined when I started hodling
[13:37] in 21 it's like I think I started at
[13:40] like 29 it went up to 68k and then you
[13:43] know tanked back down to 15 the next
[13:45] year but I have not sold a SAT aside
[13:47] from little little bits and pieces for
[13:49] folks you know through hot wallets and
[13:52] stuff like that so that's kind of how I
[13:55] got into it all and now there's another
[13:58] piece I want to talk about just in terms
[13:59] of how Bitcoin intersects with this
[14:01] Global uh transformation that we're in
[14:03] but I just want to kind of open up the
[14:05] door and see if you have any particular
[14:06] questions because I realized I've been
[14:08] just you know rattling on here there's
[14:11] there's a lot of interesting things um
[14:14] first of all like yeah the the Bitcoin
[14:15] advisor was already very um present on
[14:19] my podcast uh I they're probably like 10
[14:22] plus people from the from the from the
[14:25] list that you uh said I think only hle n
[14:28] was not on like I think all the names
[14:30] that you named I I think I had them all
[14:32] on uh so like the they have been very
[14:36] present already on the podcast some even
[14:38] like twice for example Peter dunworth uh
[14:40] Peter dunworth is actually uh with his
[14:43] two videos in the top 22 times of my
[14:47] podcast he's amazing he's just brilliant
[14:49] and he's so articulate I mean I love
[14:51] pulling him into you know to client
[14:52] sessions um just kind of a little backup
[14:55] and and and have him give his
[14:56] perspective because he's so articulate
[14:58] and incredibly knowledgeable with his 20
[15:00] years of being a financial adviser to
[15:02] high net worth individuals and family
[15:04] offices yeah he's
[15:07] fantastic and there's a lot of
[15:09] interesting things in there that you
[15:10] said um I mean obviously what what I
[15:13] thought about like your uh red pilling
[15:16] moment and then the final cover with the
[15:18] orange pill it's it's what usually as
[15:20] you described Bitcoin has go through
[15:22] after they they realized with Bitcoin
[15:25] and there's this meme that Bitcoin is
[15:27] are unemployable
[15:29] so like they they they they don't want
[15:31] to uh do the normal standard 9 to5 they
[15:35] usually try to to find some some other
[15:37] arrangement I mean that probably most
[15:40] Bitcoins are still employed uh but there
[15:43] there's like this there's a waking
[15:44] moment of like oh like my time is
[15:46] actually my most valuable thing and I
[15:48] don't want to waste it uh working for
[15:51] for someone else's stream uh and what
[15:54] what I also found interesting um before
[15:57] we start going with like what's the new
[15:59] eror um you talked about inner growth
[16:01] versus external growth uh and uh left uh
[16:06] and right pre which is super fascinating
[16:09] because those are two things that I
[16:10] think actually have never been on the
[16:12] podcast uh and something that I have
[16:15] been researching a little bit I'm not
[16:17] super deep into that but uh maybe let's
[16:20] start with the inner and the external
[16:22] growth what what do you mean by by that
[16:26] um so uh we have a lot of you know
[16:29] external growth in terms of how we're
[16:31] trained how we're socialized how we're
[16:33] educated you know all these external
[16:35] influences um that they kind of make an
[16:38] imprint on us they condition us you know
[16:41] we we create beliefs we create uh kind
[16:44] of sense of what is true for us I call
[16:46] it the small T truths not the capital T
[16:48] truths of you know the larger truths in
[16:50] the universe like you know gravity or
[16:52] whatever um but they condition us to
[16:55] think a certain way to be a certain way
[16:57] um and so kind of that external imprint
[17:01] and sometimes we have to um well so
[17:05] there there's external uh growth through
[17:07] that learning education those kinds of
[17:10] things but the internal growth comes
[17:13] from when you start to question that who
[17:15] am I really really who am I without
[17:18] these imprints without these uh you know
[17:21] the conditioning social conditioning
[17:23] religious familial cultural um even
[17:27] sometimes from trauma you know we can
[17:29] have we can have inference from trauma
[17:30] that have happened to us so when we
[17:32] start uh looking at those and really
[17:36] kind of questioning who am I at the
[17:37] really at the core of me what is my
[17:39] Essence without all of the stuff that's
[17:41] kind of layered on top and we start
[17:44] exploring kind of that inner perspective
[17:46] and figuring out who we are um over
[17:49] these last few decades I've done a
[17:50] boatload of my own kind of personal
[17:53] growth work that I do with clients now
[17:55] with um you know entrepreneurs and
[17:58] Business Leaders
[17:59] Advanced personal growth I call it
[18:00] graduate school for personal growth
[18:02] because we're using really Advanced
[18:03] bioenergetic uh methods and tools and
[18:06] I've done all of that myself to kind of
[18:08] clear out all of the conditioning that
[18:10] may not have been so helpful um I grew
[18:13] up with a a military and engineer father
[18:17] and you know and that uh the standards
[18:19] were very high and you had to meet them
[18:22] and so I grew up kind of like type
[18:24] doublea personality which is I think is
[18:26] why I ended up in Tech and on Wall
[18:27] Street it's like you know I'm going to
[18:29] be really successful in the big hard
[18:32] areas and that wasn't actually really
[18:34] good fit for my nature you know so
[18:37] clearing out the beliefs that I had to
[18:39] be a certain way um that I had to
[18:42] achieve in a certain way what success
[18:44] looked like um you know Finding kind of
[18:48] what was true for me so that inner
[18:50] growth peeling away those layers I call
[18:53] it Success Through subtraction right
[18:55] peeling away those those layers that
[18:57] weren't me to begin with and really kind
[18:59] of figuring out what my true Essence is
[19:03] and being able to express that which is
[19:05] kind of how I've ended up here it's
[19:07] super interesting it the first time I
[19:10] thought about things like that is the um
[19:14] I call it the Olympia winner depressions
[19:17] uh they have this this external thing
[19:20] that have got them motivated for so long
[19:23] um of like okay winning that one medal
[19:26] uh and once it got it they they like
[19:30] okay like now I reached it now I'm there
[19:32] where I always wanted to be and now like
[19:36] like what what what else is there to
[19:37] achieve and and and they they don't have
[19:39] that inner component they don't have
[19:41] something sustainable like sustainable
[19:43] but uh they they just reached at one
[19:46] point and uh they they enjoyed the the
[19:49] journey and now the journey is uh came
[19:51] to a came to an
[19:53] end exactly and it can be really CH it's
[19:56] like I see this all the time with um
[19:58] with people who retire and you know no
[20:00] matter what age they are it used to be
[20:02] you know 60s whatever but with
[20:03] bitcoiners it's even earlier and they're
[20:05] like what do I do with myself what's my
[20:07] purpose you know why like why am I here
[20:12] um who am I and one of the things I
[20:14] really um focus on I don't have goals
[20:17] with clients but if I had an overarching
[20:19] goal it would be helping them um have
[20:22] the clearest fullest expression of who
[20:24] they are in the world you know that full
[20:26] creative expression of who they are in
[20:27] the world that's really in alignment
[20:29] with who they are it's the the hardest
[20:30] to find out um one thing also with maybe
[20:34] it touches on that a little bit if the
[20:35] left versus the right brain what do you
[20:38] think is more present with with Bitcoin
[20:41] as probably the the right
[20:44] one well you know it's it's I mean I
[20:47] think people who you know have a science
[20:49] and and you know a tech background are
[20:51] attracted to it they get it um a little
[20:54] quicker I think than some folks who may
[20:57] be more on the artistic side the
[20:59] creative side the intuitive you know
[21:02] holistic side but I'm starting to see
[21:04] more and more folks showing up in my
[21:06] Twitter feed you know who are artists
[21:08] who are musicians um who are in that in
[21:12] that realm who who get this who get um
[21:16] Bitcoin not just as a Financial Freedom
[21:18] number grow up technology but a a global
[21:22] Freedom you know a human rights support
[21:25] all of these kinds of things that are
[21:27] much more kind of right brain than they
[21:29] are left brain so I'm starting to see
[21:32] more showing up in that realm um in
[21:34] terms of people who are understanding
[21:36] what Bitcoin is and we you know we're so
[21:38] early I mean I was seeing the charts
[21:40] recently that were coming out on Twitter
[21:42] of like you know 3% adoption and we're
[21:44] just at the beginning of the curve and
[21:45] there's the big curve that's coming you
[21:47] know so many more people as they
[21:49] understand what Bitcoin is will be
[21:51] attracted in and you will see a a
[21:53] broader spread of you know the right
[21:55] brain left brain if you will populace um
[21:59] understanding what it is 100% And it's
[22:02] super interesting when you think about I
[22:04] I get actually get that question a lot
[22:06] when I'm on other podcasts because I
[22:08] interview so many bitcoiners and they
[22:10] ask me like oh like what's the average
[22:11] Bitcoin like how how would you describe
[22:14] Bitcoin what have you found
[22:18] it's that there's not really um the the
[22:22] the typical bitcoiner but there are some
[22:25] things that align with most of them
[22:29] um uh because we are so early in an
[22:31] extreme big revolution so uh when you
[22:35] actually look at um uh what the
[22:38] mainstream is looking like the whole
[22:40] population and you try to categorize
[22:42] them which is really hard but if you try
[22:44] to do that uh the average bitcoiner is
[22:47] the opposite of that so what what's rare
[22:49] in the uh uh general population is
[22:52] really common in the in the Bitcoin
[22:55] population because we are so early and
[22:56] and it's a it takes a special kind of a
[22:59] uh person to to come early in Bitcoin it
[23:02] gets less the effect gets less and less
[23:04] because we're getting more and more and
[23:05] there's more facets of of that coming in
[23:08] I think sovereignty or freedom however
[23:12] you want to describe it is one thing
[23:13] that is really important like the
[23:15] individuality the independence like
[23:19] whatever the overall uh um word for that
[23:22] is is something really important and
[23:25] then you see the thing with food you see
[23:27] the thing with educ
[23:29] like that thing is just getting into all
[23:31] the the pockets in there so do you think
[23:34] do you think people come to bitcoin
[23:35] because they value sovereignty or do you
[23:37] think they're they get awakened to
[23:39] sovereignty after their is it it's a
[23:41] chicken and egg thing isn't it it's like
[23:43] ask myself that all the time it's
[23:46] because it has a really big implications
[23:49] like let's say um Bitcoin like they they
[23:53] come to bitcoin and they actually get
[23:56] awakened to the sovereignty thing if
[23:58] that's true what happens if Bitcoin is
[24:03] mass adopted like what happens to
[24:07] humanity if all of humanity go through
[24:11] that Awakening and maybe that's uh a
[24:14] perfect transition into what you were
[24:17] talking about the new era ex that is and
[24:20] it's you know a perfect question and
[24:22] that is where we're headed um and just
[24:25] just on the sovereignty part I mean
[24:28] um I don't I don't think I realized it
[24:30] until a little bit later but sovereignty
[24:31] has always been incredibly important to
[24:33] me I mean I tell people I'm on my fifth
[24:34] career you know so when I said it's been
[24:36] a real zigzag you know because way back
[24:38] when I was a dancer and then I was in
[24:40] the Arts and doing art restoration and
[24:41] working for Christies in New York and
[24:43] you know and then it was Tech I mean
[24:45] finance and then Tech and then you know
[24:47] all this um energetic stuff um and
[24:50] personal growth things
[24:52] um I was going somewhere with that and I
[24:54] just blanked on it I no no I was I I was
[24:59] um we were talking about the the average
[25:02] Bitcoin and you were asking s has always
[25:05] been like very important to me but I
[25:06] didn't realize it until kind of you know
[25:09] some of the Bitcoin things came up and I
[25:11] realiz it kind of concretized it for me
[25:14] I've lived it in my life making choices
[25:17] you know that that were aligned with
[25:19] what I felt I wanted next um not just
[25:21] following the straight and narrow path
[25:24] um so I've lived it but I didn't I
[25:25] didn't really have the word for it until
[25:27] later and and realized oh that's really
[25:30] what it is and why that's been so
[25:31] important to
[25:32] me yeah interesting that that's that's
[25:36] that's a interesting point also when you
[25:39] when you think about the the the Bitcoin
[25:42] and and and what's this journey I'm
[25:44] really not interested what you think of
[25:46] like um where are we headed in in this
[25:49] new era uh of like this new
[25:51] consciousness of like what happens if we
[25:55] go this this Bitcoin world that you can
[25:58] maybe you see at some conferences or
[25:59] like meetups and stuff like that or in
[26:02] podcasts uh and what if that becomes the
[26:05] mainstream thing so yes um I would love
[26:09] to share how Bitcoin intersects with
[26:11] this Global transformation this human
[26:13] metamorphosis that I've kind of been
[26:16] referencing um there are a number of
[26:19] significant time Cycles um it's kind of
[26:23] hard to know how to describe them but
[26:24] time cycles that have reached completion
[26:27] simultaneously so there's a 24,000 year
[26:30] it's called the K Yuga cycle and we're
[26:32] ending the age of darkness and you can
[26:34] kind of feel how dark things have been
[26:36] you know um in Corporate America
[26:39] political you know geopolitical kinds of
[26:41] things and that's actually that is
[26:43] completing believe it or not in March of
[26:45] this year we're moving into what's
[26:47] called Satya Yuga which is the Golden
[26:49] Age there's a 12,000-year photon belt
[26:52] cycle and that has to do with heightened
[26:54] awareness and deeper insights and um a
[26:57] collective shift in perceived reality
[27:00] there's a Thousand-Year solar cycle
[27:02] which means you know it's twice as
[27:04] strong solar activity and we're seeing
[27:06] much much bigger solar activity
[27:08] happening and that impacts and affects
[27:10] our physiology our DNA a lot of things
[27:13] and then we have like a 248e planetary
[27:16] cycle um that's kind of uh bringing up
[27:19] revolutionary energies if you think back
[27:22] to where we were you know 250 years ago
[27:25] approximately you had the American
[27:27] Revolution you had the French re
[27:28] Evolution so these revolutionary
[27:29] energies are coming back up again so all
[27:32] of these Cycles are completing
[27:34] simultaneously which is never happened
[27:37] before usually they're kind of staggered
[27:39] out so we have new Cycles now launching
[27:42] if you will and many spiritual leaders
[27:46] past and present have described this
[27:48] time that we are in I used to say we're
[27:51] heading we know we're heading towards
[27:52] but now we are in it um as a Great
[27:55] Awakening of the consciousness of
[27:57] humanity
[27:58] so it's a it's a um expansion of
[28:01] capabilities past how we have known
[28:03] ourselves as three-dimensional humans
[28:05] with just our five senses so it's an
[28:07] upgrade to our DNA leading to psychic SE
[28:12] sensitivities um expanded Consciousness
[28:15] multi-dimensionality awareness of
[28:17] ourselves as multi-dimensional beings so
[28:20] we're shifting from really just being
[28:22] mind focused into heart awareness I
[28:24] don't know if you know but there are the
[28:26] same kind of neurons in your heart that
[28:27] are in your brain brain and there are
[28:29] more signals going from heart to brain
[28:30] than there are from brain to heart so
[28:32] this is kind of like a wisdom Center and
[28:34] has the capacity to collect to connect
[28:36] in with the entire Collective
[28:38] Consciousness this doesn't this is like
[28:40] playing little you know computer
[28:42] programs over and over but this has the
[28:44] capacity to connect into a much larger
[28:47] sense of Consciousness and awareness and
[28:49] then that awareness of the part that we
[28:51] play in the greater Cosmic or even
[28:53] Galactic family we are not just little
[28:55] three-dimensional beings Here We Are
[28:57] Spiritual beings we are actually
[28:58] connected to a larger Cosmic and
[29:02] Galactic family so what will we in this
[29:05] big shift that's happening what will we
[29:07] be what will we be observing moving
[29:10] forward so we're moving from top- down
[29:15] uh power over you know corporate poit
[29:18] political and governmental structures so
[29:20] the elites having power over everyone
[29:23] else um severe uh financial and rights
[29:28] inequality that we've seen and the
[29:31] qualities of of Separation division
[29:34] manipulation austic you know all all of
[29:37] the things that are kind of coming to
[29:38] the surface that you're seeing the
[29:40] shattering truths that are coming up so
[29:42] we're moving into a higher Octave of
[29:46] Consciousness and the qualities that are
[29:49] um that that holds are cooperation
[29:54] collaboration power down to the
[29:56] individual so we're talking about
[29:58] sovereignty uh personal sovereignty
[30:02] transparency um learning how to be
[30:05] energetic co-creators because we really
[30:07] are co-creators in this universe and
[30:10] coming together as Humanity in
[30:13] compassion in unity
[30:15] Consciousness and what we're going to
[30:17] see out in the world in this period are
[30:20] rapid leaps leaps and breakthroughs in
[30:24] science in Tech in aviation in genetics
[30:30] healing Technologies plasma physics um
[30:34] Energy Systems like free energy you know
[30:36] for individuals in throughout the planet
[30:39] and a a greater recognition of and
[30:43] contact with non-human entities and
[30:47] Technologies galact or Galactic family
[30:49] if you will and you're already starting
[30:50] to see a lot of the you know it's
[30:52] already been there it's just been hidden
[30:53] from us for a long time that you know
[30:55] we've had visits visitations and um you
[30:59] know uh off-planet technologies that
[31:02] were not allowed to be seen by the
[31:04] public um so we're we're moving from you
[31:08] know as I said uh mind thought into the
[31:11] wisdom of the heart wisdom of the heart
[31:12] awareness and the qualities of Bitcoin
[31:16] totally align with the values and
[31:18] qualities of this new Earth that's
[31:21] emerging so decentralization equality
[31:24] individual sovereignty um glob Global
[31:28] borderless truth
[31:31] transparency all of the qualities of
[31:33] Bitcoin are also totally in alignment
[31:35] with where we're headed and um when you
[31:39] think about everything is energy and
[31:40] frequency we are bioelectrical beings we
[31:43] are energy beings if you kind of you
[31:46] know get all the way down to the you
[31:47] know subatomic level it's just it's just
[31:50] a not it's space in there not a lot
[31:52] there's no real matter right when you
[31:54] get into quantum
[31:56] physics so everything is energy and
[31:58] frequency and Bitcoin is digital money
[32:02] whatever you want to call that store of
[32:03] value you know those three things right
[32:05] medium exchange it's energy money it's
[32:08] energy money so this neutral Global
[32:12] money is going to enable and promote the
[32:15] cooperation and peace that is coming in
[32:17] this new period so there are two there
[32:20] are two broad timelines it's almost like
[32:22] two trains that are leaving the station
[32:25] you know based on an energetic Focus
[32:27] here and one is kind of the the old
[32:29] school fear-based mainstream Tech
[32:33] synthetic giving kind of energetic life
[32:35] support to the old systems that are
[32:37] crumbling and the other is conscious
[32:40] aware you know heightened Consciousness
[32:42] love-based residing in the frequencies
[32:45] of love and joy and gratitude and
[32:47] compassion and peace and feeding the
[32:50] timeline of this new this new Earth that
[32:52] we are moving into and these trains are
[32:53] kind of they're still they're still
[32:55] going uh parallel but they're starting
[32:57] to Di Verge you know there will be folks
[33:00] who still stay on that three-dimensional
[33:01] you know I'm operating out of fear and
[33:05] all of those kinds of qualities and the
[33:07] ones who are really saying this is where
[33:09] I want to be in my life and you see a
[33:10] lot of bitcoiners attracted to
[33:13] compassion peace love all of those kinds
[33:16] of things you're seeing that in that
[33:18] realm 2025 this year hang on one second
[33:22] here got a frog in my
[33:23] throat all it happens that's why I have
[33:26] my very big class of water do with me
[33:29] got a Stein yeah have have a Stein and
[33:32] it usually it gets out of the way very
[33:35] soon yeah now it gets I know I have a
[33:38] big water bottle too I partnered up with
[33:41] coin vigilante this is the most
[33:43] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[33:46] saw created by anyone look at that
[33:49] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[33:52] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[33:55] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out

[34:42] the most important step is to keep the
[34:45] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[34:48] wallet my personal recommendation for
[34:50] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super

[35:51] 2025 is is a real Tipping Point when I
[35:53] talked about all of those um um
[35:56] timelines
[35:58] can you tell I have a dog in here um I I
[36:01] thought so yeah yeah uh usually he's
[36:04] quiet so um 2025 is a real Tipping Point
[36:07] because of all of these these timelines
[36:10] uh completing a new one's beginning so
[36:12] it's a real Tipping Point it's a
[36:13] paradigm chattering time and this has
[36:16] been predicted for eons um seriously
[36:20] this has been you know uh Mayan
[36:22] calendars and you know very Ancient
[36:24] Ancient predictions of this is the time
[36:26] when everything's going to shift
[36:28] and it's um this year is going to be
[36:31] very Dynamic very eventful even more
[36:33] than 2024 was hey come
[36:38] here he wants to be in the podcast he
[36:40] wants to be in the podcast he does
[36:42] indeed um so it's going to be a really
[36:45] Dynamic eventful year and the Matrix as
[36:48] we have known it you know we talk about
[36:50] being in the Matrix and stepping out of
[36:51] the Matrix and being orange pilled right
[36:54] is falling away and it's that Matrix is
[36:57] bigger than and the financial the
[36:59] governmental the political structures it
[37:02] really is reality as you have known it
[37:05] on all levels so it's a time of um
[37:09] Awakening and shattering truths being
[37:12] revealed and we're starting to see this
[37:14] I mean even just in the last you know
[37:16] six weeks you know the truths they're
[37:18] coming up about just where money is
[37:21] being spent and who's doing what and
[37:23] who's hiding what and all of these kinds
[37:25] of things um so it's it's a time of of
[37:30] disillusion of the old paradigms and the
[37:32] emergence of new paradigms and the
[37:35] themes of this time are basically death
[37:39] transformation and
[37:41] rebirth um if we look at it from
[37:45] numerology it's a ninee and the nine
[37:47] year is a year of endings you know and
[37:49] you have endings and you have
[37:51] Beginnings from the Chinese uh excuse
[37:56] me from Chinese calendar uh it's a snake
[38:00] year hang on yeah they they good Z of
[38:06] water so it's the snake snake year and
[38:11] that's about shedding old skins old
[38:12] beliefs old paradigms paradigms that are
[38:14] no longer working um and I said these
[38:18] revolutionary energies are very present
[38:21] it's the same as 250 years ago the same
[38:23] kind of energy and you're seeing it in
[38:25] Germany in France you know the
[38:26] governments Germany France UK Canada
[38:29] here you're seeing things start to U
[38:34] fall apart you know dissolve populace
[38:36] rising up saying no more of this right
[38:39] and if we go even further back to the
[38:42] mid 1500s the same energies um
[38:46] Copernicus was developing his
[38:48] heliocentric theory right that we go
[38:51] around the
[38:52] Sun um you know the sun doesn't go
[38:54] around us so we're in this true
[38:58] metamorphosis State and it's it's a
[39:00] strange place to be because you know the
[39:03] caterpillar before it gets to be a
[39:05] butterfly it goes through this uh
[39:07] intermediate state where it's literally
[39:09] goop I mean there's just like nothing
[39:11] there right it's not a caterpillar
[39:13] anymore and it's not a butterfly it's
[39:15] just goop right we are in that kind of
[39:18] goop stage and it's a you know things
[39:21] are just going to be dismantling falling
[39:24] apart and it's not going to be a linear
[39:26] process not going to be a nice even you
[39:29] know well we're just going to change and
[39:31] gradually you know things it's no this
[39:34] is jumps in state instantaneous
[39:36] dimensional shifts um really big shifts
[39:40] happening specifically this year and a
[39:42] little bit into 26 and 27 but this year
[39:44] is going to be massive and and
[39:47] ultimately at the very personal level
[39:49] we're being guided to step into the
[39:51] trest highest versions of ourselves
[39:54] Bitcoin kind of ask that asks that of us
[39:59] um and this Pro this metamorphic process
[40:02] is also uh asking that of us encouraging
[40:06] supporting us in our own personal
[40:09] metamorphosis as well as what's
[40:10] happening in the
[40:12] planet
[40:16] so um so I was aware of this timeline a
[40:19] number of years ago I've been kind of my
[40:21] friends call me a Tracker because I
[40:23] track you know I track things from a
[40:25] bunch of different trajectories
[40:27] um in a bunch of different ways and I'm
[40:29] always kind of tracking different energy
[40:30] Pathways and shifts and what's happening
[40:32] at a bunch of different levels Tech
[40:33] levels energy spiritual bioenergetic all
[40:36] sorts of things like that so I've been
[40:38] tracking this for a while but I couldn't
[40:41] see how this big massive transformation
[40:43] was going to play out given the super
[40:46] powerful entrenched you know financial
[40:49] and geopolitical systems that are Global
[40:52] right and then Bitcoin when I said
[40:54] Bitcoin was like the puzzle piece that
[40:55] fell into place it's like Bitcoin is is
[40:58] providing not only a key to the
[41:00] disillusion of the old but it's
[41:02] providing the foundation for the new so
[41:05] it's creating a new not just a new
[41:07] Global Financial system but it's going
[41:10] to act as a vehicle to um support a new
[41:15] Social and energetic construct like
[41:19] imagine eventually eliminating National
[41:22] borders so there are no more countries
[41:25] while still keeping and appreciating
[41:26] unique cultural differences you know of
[41:29] different areas but having one Global
[41:33] unified Planet rather than all of these
[41:35] separate countries you know so I'm
[41:37] calling Bitcoin like conscious money it
[41:40] has like
[41:43] Consciousness
[41:44] and sorry but I think it is also the
[41:48] like Bitcoin in a in a way already
[41:50] dissolves a little bit of those borders
[41:53] absolutely we're already seeing that
[41:55] where um I I my my my video editor is in
[42:00] in Colombia so uh we I try doing the
[42:05] Fiat and the Bitcoin payments and it's
[42:08] possible like you can do the Fiat
[42:11] payments it's just expensive and it
[42:13] takes a while but also the the the the
[42:17] Bitcoin payment it's like you just need
[42:19] an address you just need an account and
[42:21] you can send it there uh and it's not
[42:23] like oh like I have to type in his name
[42:26] his address uh his routing number his
[42:29] account number like there's literally a
[42:31] list that didn't even fit on the screen
[42:35] of my phone I had to scroll down to get
[42:37] the whole list uh with like country
[42:40] address and everything that you have to
[42:42] fill out to make one transaction and I'm
[42:45] like okay why do I need all those
[42:47] informations to send Financial energy I
[42:51] just need an address like like who why
[42:54] why do they care who's behind that
[42:55] address and Bitcoin kind of makes that
[42:58] whole thing brings the globe already
[43:00] together and dissolves that National
[43:01] bords already a little bit absolutely
[43:04] and you know with the Bitcoin advisor we
[43:05] have we have 40 ad advisors all the way
[43:07] around the world if we were doing
[43:08] separate you know we were doing euros
[43:10] and Australian dollars it's like we do
[43:12] everything in SATs because it just it
[43:14] makes it easy right so it is it is
[43:17] already dissolving that's what I'm
[43:18] saying it's like it's going to support
[43:20] where the planet's already headed in
[43:21] this in this significant metamorphosis
[43:23] and uh I also you said something that
[43:26] you you don't think it's gradual but uh
[43:29] you think that will be re jumping or
[43:31] something like you said it's basically
[43:32] the P Louis theory of gradually and then
[43:36] thenly point right exactly and it is you
[43:40] know there will be really instantaneous
[43:42] dimensional shifts State changes this is
[43:45] not going to be a linear process that's
[43:47] why when you look at it you go huh okay
[43:49] I could see that over the next decade
[43:50] it's like no no no no you know things
[43:52] are going to happen over the next 12 to
[43:53] you know 24 months that are going to
[43:55] radically change things and we can't
[43:56] even anticipate it from where we stand
[43:59] it's going to be so significant so
[44:01] profound if if you had to anticipate it
[44:04] how would you say is like is the the
[44:07] average average life
[44:09] changing um so how do I even describe
[44:13] this let's see imagine an event
[44:16] happening that would
[44:18] instantaneously um allow you to have
[44:20] higher level um Consciousness capacities
[44:23] have you have you heard of the telepathy
[44:25] tapes are you familiar with that uh no
[44:28] not at all okay so um there's a a woman
[44:32] who I don't want to go deep down that
[44:34] rabbit hole but basically
[44:36] um let's see how do I want to describe
[44:40] this there's a podcast series I think
[44:42] it's 10 um 10 episodes where she is um
[44:46] exploring autistic kids who we think of
[44:50] them as and these are nonverbal autistic
[44:53] kids and we think of them as being
[44:54] diminished in their capacities but
[44:56] they're diminish in their phys
[44:57] physicality of being able to to convey
[44:59] words but they're all in there and so
[45:01] these kids are are conversing
[45:04] telepathically with each other over time
[45:06] and
[45:07] space and it just opened up this whole
[45:10] new realm and their teachers realize it
[45:12] and their parents realize it so this
[45:13] idea of of of um being able to
[45:16] communicate telepathically uh we won't
[45:19] have to have iPhones you know um but
[45:22] when you are be able to read someone's
[45:23] energy and read what their thoughts are
[45:25] lies will not be possible
[45:27] you know so it's going to shift the
[45:30] entire you know Paradigm and when
[45:32] everybody's Consciousness is raised
[45:34] that's just one example of it when the
[45:36] entire planet's Consciousness is raised
[45:38] very very quickly and this through an
[45:41] event that happens I don't know what
[45:43] form that's going to take but I'm
[45:45] hearing it from a number of different
[45:46] directions that will shift it uh
[45:49] radically and so we'll have a very
[45:50] different awareness of each other and
[45:52] that sense of there's a spiritual
[45:55] concept of basically We Are One
[45:57] you know we're just one Spirit having
[45:59] these different human experiences right
[46:02] and when you realize that you and I
[46:04] really are one how could I do something
[46:06] that was going to hurt you how could I
[46:07] not you know give you food if you're
[46:09] hungry so when you have this awareness
[46:11] of that we really are all one it's not
[46:14] possible to hurt someone to murder them
[46:16] to not feed them to not care for them so
[46:19] it shifts the entire um sense of who we
[46:22] are as humans and it's it's all in that
[46:25] theory of like we we have to level up as
[46:28] as Humanity of having one communication
[46:31] layer one money layer one I forgot the
[46:35] name but there's like this this scale uh
[46:39] where where we just move up those the
[46:41] those levels and we are far down right
[46:45] now because we have like we are not that
[46:47] many in the but we have so many
[46:49] different currencies we have so many
[46:51] different languages we have so many
[46:53] different um uh and in the cultural
[46:56] differences a good like it's it's great
[46:58] there's even like within Austria there
[47:00] are like nine
[47:02] different ways of speaking the Austrian
[47:06] dialect and the Austrian dialect is
[47:08] different from German uh well German is
[47:11] speaking and it's basically the same
[47:12] language and then the Swiss it's
[47:14] something completely different and and
[47:16] Germany Austria Swiss in itself it's not
[47:19] that big and we have so many diverse
[47:22] places of uh what you can speak uh and
[47:25] how you say it and how you pronounce
[47:27] things and and just words that um an an
[47:31] an Austrian in the vest doesn't
[47:33] understand but the eastone speaks it
[47:35] every day so there there there's those
[47:39] uh uh interesting things of like we we
[47:43] we kind of come to the point of where
[47:46] the whole planet is having one
[47:48] communication layer however this looks
[47:50] and and one monetary layer and one like
[47:53] we we're coming closer together as as as
[47:56] Humanity
[47:57] and there's like social media playing
[47:58] into this the internet is playing into
[48:00] this Bitcoin is playing into this as a
[48:02] technology uh so that that's really
[48:05] interesting to to to to to look at and
[48:08] seeing that transformation uh at the
[48:10] Consciousness level we're calling it
[48:12] Unity Consciousness right because it's a
[48:14] unified Consciousness you know with all
[48:16] of these delightful different cultural
[48:18] differences right but you don't have to
[48:19] have separate monies and separate you
[48:21] know borders and things like that so
[48:24] yeah it's it's a very different it's
[48:27] almost hard to wrap our head around
[48:28] because we're just so used to what we've
[48:30] known right and to imagine what that
[48:33] would be like but yeah it it makes total
[48:36] sense because now all of the sudden um
[48:39] it's
[48:40] like even if you bring it down to
[48:42] practical level now because we have the
[48:46] internet the communication layer um we
[48:49] now can consciously see okay what's
[48:52] going on in America just go back like
[48:56] 100 years that was very hard to do and
[48:58] now we have uh an clear flow of ideas
[49:03] Now with uh like Google search was one
[49:05] one major Innovation where all of the
[49:08] sudden you could search for things and
[49:09] you're like wow I don't have to go to
[49:11] the library uh and now ai is
[49:15] just blow my mind every day right
[49:18] exactly and just just the technology
[49:19] that has made you know the the Earth one
[49:22] where you can get information from
[49:24] anywhere you can talk to anyone so that
[49:27] part is happening but you know if you
[49:29] take that and add in a Unity
[49:32] Consciousness where you know there's
[49:33] there's peace and love and harmony and
[49:35] cooperation and compassion and
[49:37] collaboration and all those wonderful
[49:38] things you know create it's like it's
[49:41] like an even better better better
[49:42] version of just the technology right
[49:45] yeah technology I think is is the tool
[49:48] uh and a tool for that if feel like it's
[49:51] it's like you uh and and there's like
[49:54] this this Unity uh and and kind of need
[49:57] some sort of of of of tools for that or
[50:01] like some kind of manif manifestation
[50:03] for for that and uh for me it's just
[50:07] great like the closer Humanity gets to
[50:09] each other the the better it is and uh
[50:11] if if we get further away from each
[50:13] other it's it's it's probably not as as
[50:15] good like the this Division and this uh
[50:18] things is usually usually not productive
[50:21] exactly exactly have you ever heard of
[50:23] of maso's hierarchy of needs are you
[50:25] familiar oh yeah yeah that's that's a
[50:27] popular one so kind of we're we're
[50:29] really moving towards that that very top
[50:30] of the pyramid the self-actualization
[50:32] part of that you know not at the bottom
[50:34] it's just kind of like um uh you know
[50:37] survival and then you know just basic
[50:39] needs and belonging and self-esteem but
[50:42] self-actualization that's kind of where
[50:44] we're we're headed as Humanity as humans
[50:47] on this planet amazing uh that that was
[50:50] that was really cool um thank you so
[50:52] much already for for sharing that with
[50:54] uh with us um we have one question
[50:56] question that I ask each and every one
[50:58] of my guests will be interesting to to
[51:00] see uh what you do that um I usually ask
[51:04] what can we learn from you besides
[51:06] Bitcoin um but I would I I would add uh
[51:11] besides Bitcoin and all the things you
[51:13] already talked about like what what else
[51:16] is to learn about uh from you um I guess
[51:19] there are there are three things I would
[51:22] really love to you know leave listeners
[51:25] and viewers with
[51:27] um and the first one is that this the
[51:30] you know when I talked about the the
[51:32] stage between the caterpillar and the
[51:34] Butterfly we're in the goop stage we're
[51:35] in the dismantlement stage and that
[51:38] stage is going to be very turbulent and
[51:40] very chaotic and it's really important
[51:42] to um support yourself through that
[51:45] stage through staying in peace and love
[51:47] and Stillness staying grounded
[51:50] maintaining what I call the Observer
[51:51] perspective you know you're just
[51:53] watching the drama play out like a bird
[51:55] on a branch right uh without engaging in
[51:58] it without getting caught up in it
[52:00] ignoring the distractions in Bitcoin we
[52:02] say focusing on signal right not not you
[52:05] know the fluff and the other stuff and
[52:07] taking care of yourself and others and
[52:09] connecting to like-minded people
[52:12] communities to share and collaborate and
[52:14] holding a Clear Vision of this Ideal
[52:16] World that you want to see manifested so
[52:18] that you know during this dismantlement
[52:21] that's one thing that's really important
[52:23] the second thing is following your
[52:26] intuition in your heart that heart
[52:28] wisdom um
[52:31] and making decisions not based on what
[52:34] you think you're supposed to do what
[52:35] everyone else thinks you're supposed to
[52:37] do when I talked about that straight and
[52:38] narrow you know uh uh life path don't be
[52:43] afraid to make what can feel like a
[52:45] drastic change or a course correction
[52:47] because following a non-traditional path
[52:50] uh while it can have its challenges I
[52:52] mean that's for sure um it can create a
[52:55] really juicy life filled with a broad
[52:58] array of experiences that you'll look
[53:00] back on with appreciation and Delight so
[53:03] that's the second thing follow your
[53:04] intuition and your heart and the third
[53:07] is you know I would really recommend and
[53:10] it can make this whole time and process
[53:12] easier is to find an experienced guide
[53:15] um Mentor who can teach you who you are
[53:18] beyond the human physical form um and
[53:21] help you kind of expand your awareness
[53:23] beyond the five senses that we're
[53:24] familiar with and can in with that
[53:27] higher knowing that non-physical
[53:29] guidance we all have guides that can
[53:31] that are constantly there to assist us I
[53:33] call it our staff in the sky um and
[53:36] connecting in becoming more familiar
[53:38] with our personal and the global energy
[53:40] Fields so those those three things you
[53:43] know take self-care during this this
[53:45] really goopy stage the dismantlement
[53:47] stage following your intuition and heart
[53:50] and finding an experienced guide to
[53:52] support
[53:53] you there's something else that was
[53:55] coming up specific spefically because
[53:57] you're in your mid 20s right yeah
[54:00] exactly mid 20 26 so genz have this
[54:03] opportunity through Bitcoin to really to
[54:05] create financial and soul sovereignty
[54:08] you know not just Financial sovereignty
[54:10] but Soul sovereignty this is some of the
[54:11] things I really been talking about here
[54:13] much earlier in your life than was
[54:16] possible for prior Generations you get
[54:18] to redefine what success means for you
[54:22] that's an amazing opportunity that a lot
[54:24] of us I'm I'm basically a boomer you
[54:26] know and we didn't really I mean I've
[54:29] made my own way and my own zigzag way
[54:31] through life right but you know defining
[54:34] what success means and you know when you
[54:38] have that sense of sovereignty what can
[54:40] that create for you I mean spaciousness
[54:44] creativity the freedom to fully express
[54:46] your core nature that essence of who you
[54:48] are in whatever form you know it wants
[54:51] to take Arts business living globally
[54:54] family you know it's like what do you
[54:57] really want to do with the long Runway
[55:00] that that is available to you because
[55:02] you're not in your 50s 60s you're in
[55:03] your 20s right what do you really want
[55:05] to do with that long Runway that's
[55:07] available to you when you have Financial
[55:09] Freedom when you have the opportunity to
[55:13] create your own kind of personal
[55:15] Renaissance you know uh be in that
[55:19] place yeah that's amazing and that's
[55:24] something actually that people
[55:26] uh tell me I should write about um
[55:29] because I made exactly that shift
[55:31] because of Bitcoin I had the traditional
[55:34] career six years already um uh in a
[55:38] company that I actually liked uh the the
[55:40] people were there I liked I liked what I
[55:43] was doing uh so I was not frustrated uh
[55:46] depressed or anything like that I I was
[55:48] kind of happy in the in the job the only
[55:50] thing that I didn't like was it was
[55:53] about it security I was not crazy about
[55:55] it security
[55:56] uh I was always talking about Bitcoin
[55:59] like in I was the Bitcoin guy in the
[56:02] company so that was uh within my job my
[56:05] passion it was in my free time passion I
[56:07] really want to talk about Bitcoin and
[56:09] and uh because I think it's it's the
[56:11] biggest Revolution going on in our
[56:13] lifetime so I want to talk about
[56:16] that when I first got some money from
[56:19] Twitter which is crazy because Twitter
[56:22] is now not even a real income source for
[56:24] me but that gave me hope that gave me
[56:26] some signal uh it it it was almost
[56:29] nothing but I was like I'm talking about
[56:31] Bitcoin on the internet and I get paid
[56:34] for that uh is is is there more of that
[56:39] all of the sudden I saw like I saw the
[56:41] green grass on the other side and I was
[56:43] like oh I all I saw for the first time
[56:48] ever I saw that my grass is not that
[56:49] green or I can be greener it can be
[56:52] better uh and I just jumped uh I had I
[56:55] think like three four 400 YouTube
[56:57] subscribers I didn't had income I had
[56:59] like one sponsor that sponsor that said
[57:01] like okay let's try it out for two
[57:03] months and that didn't even work out so
[57:06] I had no uh uh security no experience in
[57:09] what I was doing I was just jumping
[57:11] honestly uh I I have an amazing family
[57:15] that's that's why I could also do it
[57:16] because they were not saying like oh I'm
[57:18] crazy I think they fought it all but
[57:22] they kept it do themselves uh which I
[57:24] highly appreciated because gave me some
[57:27] of the the graciousness to actually do
[57:29] that and the major thing that actually
[57:31] made that happen is I was always saying
[57:35] if if it actually doesn't work out I can
[57:39] do it for two years and I can live off
[57:40] my Bitcoin and then my Bitcoin also um
[57:44] that that's basically the fee that I
[57:45] have to pay for learning that lesson
[57:48] that I will learn in the next two years
[57:50] and luckily I never had to touch them I
[57:53] had every month a positive cash flow
[57:55] which which surprises me to this day by
[57:59] just jumping and now it's more about
[58:02] like just just just doing more of the
[58:04] things I really enjoy and finding
[58:06] finding the things that I really enjoy
[58:08] and doing less of the things that that I
[58:10] don't enjoy uh which the sponsors make
[58:13] possible which uh the community makes
[58:15] possible which all the things make
[58:17] possible because now I can hire people
[58:20] for for the things that I don't like
[58:22] that much and they like more and I can
[58:24] focus on the things that I like more uh
[58:26] and all of those great things uh and and
[58:29] starting to be a little bit more uh
[58:32] entrepreneurial uh but honestly it's
[58:35] more about
[58:36] the H what do I want to do with the time
[58:40] that is there from like in the morning
[58:42] till the
[58:43] evening and uh what can I do that I
[58:48] can't wait to get up that there are days
[58:51] where I stand up 2 hours before the
[58:53] alarm because there's a thought in my
[58:55] head that I just have to execute and I
[58:57] cannot sleep anymore and and those days
[58:59] are not that rare uh because I really
[59:02] want to tackle the day and that's the
[59:05] feeling I really enjoy I don't know if
[59:06] that's the life goal I have no clue what
[59:08] what life wisdom is uh but I I do like
[59:12] that I enjoy so much right now and I do
[59:14] like that um because of Bitcoin I had
[59:17] the courage to actually take that jump
[59:19] and I think that that could be something
[59:22] really encouraging for a lot of
[59:23] bitcoiners I love that and you know
[59:25] there's there's the thing I call Red
[59:27] carpeting if when you are aligned with
[59:29] you know what your soul wants for you
[59:31] and you don't even have to know the
[59:32] details you just like I have this
[59:33] intuitive hit I have to go do this I'm
[59:35] compelled to do this right and it's
[59:37] aligned with what your soul really wants
[59:40] the universe just I call it it just
[59:41] rolls out the red carpet for you you
[59:43] know and things just drop in that you
[59:45] couldn't possibly have orchestrated and
[59:48] it's just easy right you have that sense
[59:49] of it's just easy I love that red
[59:52] carpeting I've had so many experiences
[59:54] in my life where you know I made it
[59:56] decision I moved cross country from New
[59:58] York to California and I moved to a tiny
[60:01] little town where I didn't know one
[60:02] person I you know had to shut down my
[60:04] business here started up there I mean I
[60:06] started from scratch right but that move
[60:09] was the easiest thing I've ever done I
[60:11] mean it was just like the perfect mover
[60:13] came in and the perfect Packer came in
[60:15] and I found the perfect place to live
[60:16] and right across the street was an
[60:17] office I mean the universe just said oh
[60:19] we can help you with this boom boom boom
[60:21] boom boom so if you are in a lined and
[60:24] it sounds like you know that's what I
[60:26] was encouraging people to like take
[60:28] those jumps take those leaps trust your
[60:30] heart trust your you know your intuitive
[60:32] impulse to kind of head in a direction
[60:35] because if it's aligned with you you
[60:36] will be so well supported just like
[60:38] you've been
[60:39] describing yeah it's really fascinating
[60:42] because um I I got that question
[60:45] actually yesterday from a fellow Bitcoin
[60:47] podcaster that is kind of starting out
[60:49] now and is a little bit earlier to the
[60:51] game uh and she asked me oh uh how did
[60:54] you how did you reach out to the
[60:56] sponsors and I said I never reached out
[60:58] to a sponsor they all reached out to me
[61:01] and that that's I mean I reached out to
[61:03] the first one a little bit uh but like
[61:07] this is the first one that didn't work
[61:10] uh and and before it the the the kind of
[61:14] period we work together was ending a new
[61:17] one already showed up and then a new one
[61:18] showed up and a new one showed up and
[61:21] so I just put in my best effort and
[61:24] proof of work and and um I'm always a
[61:27] little bit um always a little bit
[61:30] careful because if I say like oh like
[61:31] the universe really really will take
[61:34] care of it then people sometimes take it
[61:35] as an excuse of not doing anything I see
[61:37] some people even proof of uh even the
[61:40] low time preference I see some people
[61:42] taking it as an excuse to be lazy yeah
[61:45] uh and and that that's where I always
[61:47] have a little bit of problem of like um
[61:50] yes there's a lot of things going on
[61:52] above you but and things take
[61:56] have a have a tendency to to really work
[61:59] out for you if you are following your
[62:02] true passion and you actually take
[62:04] action on it absolutely like if you just
[62:06] lay on the couch and and play
[62:08] Playstation um even if everything aligns
[62:12] nothing will happen for you not
[62:14] happening so you have to take the proof
[62:16] of work uh and actually do the things uh
[62:19] and yeah I've worked on the podcast
[62:21] since the starting like 70 80 hours now
[62:25] it's actually slowing enough down a
[62:26] little bit and I focus a little bit more
[62:27] on reading and and finding other things
[62:29] again because uh I did so much and now I
[62:33] can afford to Outsource some of the
[62:35] Small Things uh so uh that that's the
[62:38] always the really important point that I
[62:41] want to lay there because I see someone
[62:42] like oh like the universe will come to
[62:44] me and everything no yes but you also
[62:48] have to take action and and that's what
[62:51] uh you have been doing and and I just
[62:54] wanted to to give that small C people
[62:57] absolutely you know there's there's um
[62:59] you know giving um having an intention
[63:01] and then putting your attention on
[63:03] taking action so intention important
[63:05] attention both of those you know man
[63:07] create
[63:08] manifestation yeah really cool um
[63:11] perfect I think that's the perfect uh
[63:13] point for us to to go to the end routine
[63:15] of the podcast um we have an end routine
[63:18] where the previous guest is asking a
[63:20] question for the next guest without
[63:21] knowing who the next guest actually is
[63:23] uh and uh the previous guest ask you the
[63:26] question what will be the next country
[63:29] to officially announce a strategic
[63:31] Bitcoin
[63:32] Reserve oh my goodness it's a hard it's
[63:34] a hard topic it's an impossible question
[63:36] to answer I wish I knew the answer to
[63:38] that if I knew the answer to that man I
[63:40] could just be doing all sorts of things
[63:41] in the background to to uh you know take
[63:44] advantage of that I have no clue I
[63:46] really have no clue and I don't think
[63:47] anybody does I mean there are so many
[63:49] countries that that I fully believe are
[63:52] stacking in the background right and
[63:54] nobody wants to come out and admit that
[63:56] because then the whole game theory you
[63:58] know uh is activated so I think there
[64:01] are all sorts of countries stacking in
[64:02] the background you know yeah only it
[64:05] seems like only small countries can
[64:07] announce that because the game theory
[64:10] like if Russia says like oh like we are
[64:12] buying a thousand Bitcoin b day now
[64:15] right then all of a sudden everything
[64:16] shifts right and everybody's going ah we
[64:18] haven't stacked enough you know so yeah
[64:20] I think there's so much happening
[64:22] underneath the water line there you know
[64:24] and I I personally I can't wait to see
[64:25] see when that happens because I think it
[64:28] will be a domino effect if you know all
[64:30] the other countries will start uh being
[64:32] public about what they're
[64:34] doing yeah and especially because it's
[64:36] Al such a competition of like imagine
[64:38] like America like Donald Trump is like
[64:40] oh we're stacking Bitcoin then Putin is
[64:42] like oh like we are stacking more
[64:43] Bitcoin and then the European Union is
[64:45] like oh like we have to stack even more
[64:48] to protect the European Union look at
[64:50] look at the Arab Emirates I mean you
[64:52] look at at you know the Middle East you
[64:54] I mean it's like oh my goodness you know
[64:55] doing it so yeah absolutely um it was a
[64:59] pleasure talking with you uh it was
[65:01] really really cool uh I think I hope the
[65:04] the viewers and the listeners appreciate
[65:06] that uh change of pace in the podcast
