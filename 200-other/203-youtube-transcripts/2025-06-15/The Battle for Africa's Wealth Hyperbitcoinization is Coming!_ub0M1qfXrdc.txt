[00:00] the Malawi government decided to devalue
[00:02] their currency by 40% overnight no
[00:04] explanations were given you just wake up
[00:07] and your wealth has gone down by 40%
[00:09] Bitcoin helps us to have Financial
[00:12] Freedom Independence and autonomy it
[00:14] doesn't really equate us to westerners
[00:16] but it gives us a leveled playing field
[00:19] where everybody can start from zero
[00:21] Bitcoin helps us to pass wealth across
[00:23] borders the dream of having
[00:25] hyperbitcoinization is very possible we
[00:28] import inflation from Western countries
[00:30] it's basically like sending out our
[00:33] wealth and then getting back poverty in
[00:35] return Bitcoin does not discriminate
[00:37] against your race your gender your
[00:39] geographical location we have to drive
[00:42] the Bitcoin adoption we we should not
[00:44] wait for any authority to allow us that
[00:48] we can transact in Bitcoin that's not
[00:50] the Bitcoin e for Bitcoin is the
[00:53] greatest educational tool that we have
[00:55] had in that it has opened our eyes to
[00:58] the financial injustices that have been
[01:00] done to us as the human race right by
[01:02] our governments by the authorities that
[01:05] are above
[01:06] [Music]
[01:09] us why do you think is Bitcoin important
[01:12] for you uh and in Africa especially um
[01:15] so first things first I would say in
[01:18] Africa we kind of have a very um broken
[01:21] monetary system uh first of all we have
[01:23] over 40 types of currencies and trading
[01:27] inter trading in Africa becomes very
[01:30] difficult because some of these
[01:31] currencies are either based on the US
[01:35] dollar or the Fran ofone sorry not
[01:38] frankophone what is called them the
[01:41] France dollar right is that how we call
[01:44] it so it becomes challenging every time
[01:46] you want to make maybe the inter trade
[01:48] you have to first convert your currency
[01:51] which has no value across border into
[01:55] either the dollar right and then the
[01:57] person that you're trading with has to
[02:00] also convert the dollar to the fiat
[02:03] currency to actually make the trade
[02:04] possible so trading becomes difficult
[02:08] remittances becomes difficult as well
[02:11] and then we have issues such as
[02:12] devaluation of currency I don't know if
[02:14] you know this but um a couple months ago
[02:17] uh the Malawi government decided to
[02:19] devalue their currency by 40% overnight
[02:22] so this was done overnight um no
[02:25] explanations were given you just wake up
[02:27] and your wealth your whatever you have
[02:30] saved has gone down by 40% so if you're
[02:34] making an income of probably $200 or
[02:36] $100 um on a monthly basis then that
[02:39] means your salary has been slashed off
[02:42] right because that doesn't mean that the
[02:44] prices of goods will go down so it
[02:46] becomes challenging for actually people
[02:48] to get out of that Loop of poverty
[02:51] because of such things we also have
[02:53] issues such as inflation um which
[02:57] affects our lifestyle as well and
[03:00] Bitcoin comes in where Bitcoin
[03:04] definitely is a deflationary asset right
[03:07] and the fact that one Bitcoin is one
[03:10] Bitcoin anywhere that makes that makes
[03:12] it even easier for us to actually do
[03:14] start doing trading across borders when
[03:17] it comes to sending value across borders
[03:20] it becomes less expensive there's less
[03:22] bureaucracy you know you don't have
[03:25] anyone overlooking what you you're doing
[03:27] as well so it makes
[03:30] um sending information sending data
[03:33] sending value across border very easy in
[03:35] Africa for us and then it gives us a
[03:38] platform where it doesn't really equate
[03:40] us to West standers but it gives us a
[03:43] Level Playing Field where everybody can
[03:45] start from you know zero if you if you
[03:48] wish to start from zero it's fascinating
[03:50] that there are so many different
[03:51] currencies in there is the because I was
[03:55] in Egypt once and I was fascinated that
[03:59] every everyone was accepting Euros like
[04:02] I I didn't have to exchange uh I don't
[04:04] know what the the currency is their name
[04:07] but I could uh go there and buy
[04:10] everything I want with Heros like there
[04:12] was no not one shop or not one thing
[04:14] where they don't didn't accept it is the
[04:16] Euro and the US dollar like the uh
[04:18] Stronger feied currencies they also also
[04:21] big exactly exactly and you know that's
[04:24] the most unfortunate part is that some
[04:27] countries in Africa they um their fat
[04:30] currency is actually really bad that
[04:32] they would rather accept dollar or the
[04:34] Euro uh so you have Egyptian Egypt
[04:37] there's also Zimbabwe as well they would
[04:39] rather trade in the dollar other than
[04:41] their own fat currency because um it has
[04:44] lost value over time and there's no
[04:46] point in actually uh doing trades with
[04:48] it so you find a lot of people accepting
[04:51] foreign currency as opposed to theirs
[04:53] and when you're in such an economy what
[04:56] happens is you really don't grow as a
[04:58] country right because you have based
[05:01] your value on a Foreigner's currency
[05:04] interesting what would you say is the
[05:06] biggest challenge out of those for
[05:08] Africa is it the the the saving the
[05:11] value or is the remittance uh
[05:13] transferring the wealth what is the
[05:15] biggest challenge in Africa that Bitcoin
[05:17] is
[05:18] solving I think probably um it's
[05:22] wholesome right when it comes to store
[05:24] of wealth um if you're looking to
[05:26] probably save your wealth uh in the next
[05:28] 10 years and you're having um a
[05:31] government that can wake up and devalue
[05:33] your currency or inflation happening
[05:36] then the best option for you would be to
[05:38] save in Bitcoin right and then the other
[05:41] thing if you're doing trades or if
[05:42] you're sending for example if you're um
[05:45] in the states and you're sending money
[05:47] back home which is a huge way it's a
[05:50] huge income when it comes to African
[05:52] countries so if you're sending money
[05:54] back home then you need um a currency
[05:56] that will not maybe probably have the
[05:59] most most um expenses attached to it
[06:02] fees rather attached to it so I would
[06:04] say Bitcoin is really wholesome there's
[06:06] no one specific use case for Bitcoin in
[06:10] Africa but people and individuals use it
[06:13] as per their utility cases and as per
[06:15] their challenges interesting you're also
[06:17] really big on uh putting Bitcoin for
[06:22] African women uh because you said like
[06:25] they have specific um challenges also uh
[06:29] what are those and and and how did you
[06:32] how do you try to encounter them okay so
[06:36] the biggest challenge that we faces
[06:38] African females is the inability to
[06:41] actually um get on board in financial
[06:44] decision makings right and this has been
[06:47] brought about by long-standing
[06:48] traditions and culture and how does this
[06:51] look like it manifests in forms of lack
[06:54] of education for the girl child which um
[06:57] at the end of the day causes you to miss
[06:58] out on opportunities as well we have
[07:01] issues when it comes to property rights
[07:03] as a female you're not allowed to
[07:05] inherit property so which makes it even
[07:07] hard for you to get uh probably credit
[07:10] from the bank if you want to get maybe a
[07:13] loan it becomes hard for you as a female
[07:16] um and this again like I said it comes
[07:19] it's just about traditions and cultural
[07:21] norms and I guess this might also apply
[07:24] in other countries outside of Africa but
[07:27] for us it's truly a problem I feel it's
[07:31] a problem
[07:32] because if we want to change the African
[07:35] narrative our financial um um our
[07:39] financial system that we need to have
[07:42] everybody on board that's what I
[07:44] normally say we need to have everybody
[07:46] on board everybody involved and so for
[07:49] me training or teaching um or onboarding
[07:53] African females is not just about
[07:55] individuals it's me looking at the Next
[07:58] Generation bit coin helps us to pass
[08:01] wealth from one person to the other
[08:03] Bitcoin helps us to pass wealth from one
[08:05] from across borders Bitcoin helps us to
[08:08] have Financial Freedom Independence and
[08:11] autonomy and if we can have everybody on
[08:14] board then this the dream of having um
[08:18] hyperbitcoinization world is very
[08:22] possible that's that's crazy so you are
[08:25] saying that women in Africa aren't
[08:29] allowed inherent property yes um again
[08:33] this is tradition and I get where
[08:36] probably our ancestors were coming from
[08:38] because when you're married off then
[08:39] that would mean you're taking your
[08:41] property with you to a different family
[08:43] so that was the thinking behind it right
[08:47] but then moving forward in this economy
[08:51] it's not a practical tradition that
[08:53] should be should actually be continuing
[08:56] to work right so one because we seeing
[09:00] cycles of poverty because half of the
[09:03] population of Africa you know which is
[09:06] the female are depending on a very
[09:08] minority who actually are capable of
[09:12] standing on their own so Africa as a
[09:15] whole does not have um let me say
[09:18] economic wise we're not we're the
[09:20] richest continent when it comes to
[09:22] resources right but our economies are
[09:24] really doing badly off so the men that
[09:28] we should be depending on already
[09:31] struggling and if we have like probably
[09:35] we are about 1.4 billion people in
[09:37] Africa so if you have half of that
[09:38] population depending on a already
[09:40] struggling population then what happens
[09:42] we continue to see these cycles of
[09:44] poverty so for me having everybody on
[09:48] board someone everybody chipping in on
[09:50] the table makes us have more resources
[09:53] which will lead to um access to better
[09:56] education which will lead to access to
[09:59] uh better medical assistance leads to
[10:03] homes you know better homing environment
[10:06] and so on this leads me to a question
[10:09] that I've never really asked before but
[10:12] how do you think Bitcoin will influence
[10:15] romantic relationship and Trust in
[10:18] marriage when all of the sudden you can
[10:20] actually
[10:21] verify uh like inherence is like um a
[10:25] government thing but with Bitcoin it's
[10:27] yourself like you can program that this
[10:29] Bitcoin will go to that person no matter
[10:32] what which which could like take the
[10:35] trust out of finance and could like
[10:37] enhance like a romantic relationship to
[10:39] a sense like did you ever thought about
[10:41] that so from my point of view this is
[10:44] how it helps in most uh the cases that
[10:48] I've dealt with so one of the issues
[10:50] that we have when it comes to marriages
[10:53] is either Financial abuse or uh physical
[10:57] abuse and we've had cases in our
[10:59] Community where we've seen ladies who
[11:00] are being both abused in either ways and
[11:05] when they start earning in Bitcoin they
[11:07] can start preparing their way out of
[11:09] these situations right so it kind of
[11:12] helps in some level the other thing I
[11:14] would say because Bitcoin is Broad right
[11:17] it's a technology and it brings also
[11:20] opportunities and we really don't have
[11:22] to wait on getting the traditional form
[11:25] of work right you can work online and
[11:27] get paid so Here Comes um a situation
[11:31] where a housewife can actually work
[11:34] online and earn in Bitcoin and thereby
[11:36] helping their partner so for me Bitcoin
[11:38] really makes uh marriage flourish as
[11:41] opposed to you know the kind of thinking
[11:44] we might have that if you have Bitcoin
[11:46] then it's you you'll kind of keep it
[11:48] secret from your partner and all that so
[11:50] I think Bitcoin makes everything else
[11:53] flourish around us of that few a lot
[11:55] it's really cool to think like that it's
[11:57] also interesting when we think of the
[12:01] hundreds of different of power shifts
[12:03] that Bitcoin will do between uh let's
[12:06] say America and Africa there's a power
[12:08] shift happening with Bitcoin but also
[12:10] between husband and wife is a power
[12:12] shift happening
[12:14] uh with Bitcoin that that's quite
[12:17] amazing to see honestly I I think a
[12:19] Bitcoin world could be a a very nice and
[12:22] trusting World obviously uh Bitcoin will
[12:26] not uh prevent that you will be
[12:29] physically abused so like Bitcoin does
[12:31] not help you protecting against physical
[12:33] abuse but it gives you the financial
[12:37] tools to have an escape patch so I think
[12:41] that's it's a a really powerful thing
[12:44] exactly exactly and I don't really feel
[12:47] that Bitcoin uh sort of shifts the power
[12:51] in couples I feel it actually gives them
[12:54] more you know a a reason to bond so for
[12:57] example if you one of you decides to
[13:00] save in Fiat the other one decides to
[13:02] save in cuz at the end of the day you
[13:04] need to pay your bills in your local
[13:06] currency right and the other one decides
[13:08] okay let's put money in Bitcoin then 10
[13:11] years 20 years from now your kids will
[13:14] have the possibility of going to
[13:15] University because the price of Bitcoin
[13:19] mostly goes up right so I think it
[13:22] brings couples together uh it makes them
[13:26] more as partners rather than one being a
[13:30] slave to the other or completely
[13:32] independent of the other yeah I love
[13:35] that feel a lot really cool um let's
[13:37] come to that power shift that I thought
[13:40] uh told you about with American Africa
[13:42] and other countries how do you see in
[13:44] general Bitcoin empowering um countries
[13:48] that are relying on other currencies and
[13:52] US dollar is is or the Americans are
[13:55] exporting their inflation into other
[13:57] current in other countries I think
[13:59] there's like 66 countries that are
[14:01] relied only on the US dollar uh don't
[14:04] have their own currency and there are
[14:07] then more countries like in Egypt where
[14:10] I paid with Euros uh where they have
[14:12] their own currency but still like the
[14:14] the Euro the dollar is is quite popular
[14:16] there um how will that uh shift for
[14:21] Africa go once we are in this utopian
[14:25] Bitcoin standard world what do you think
[14:27] will will happen there I think you've
[14:30] clearly stated it one of the problems is
[14:32] they infl they actually export we import
[14:37] inflation from you know uh Western
[14:40] countries and if you're using Bitcoin
[14:42] then that stops that means a more
[14:45] flourishing economy right because the
[14:48] value is being transa is is being um
[14:53] transferred within and also can be kept
[14:56] within the African countries as opposed
[14:58] to to exporting our value outside and
[15:01] importing inflation for us so it's
[15:03] basically like sending out um our wealth
[15:07] and then getting back poverty in return
[15:10] so I think for me that's the biggest the
[15:12] biggest win for us as Africans if we do
[15:14] adopt Bitcoin and we go to we get to
[15:17] that utopian level where everybody
[15:19] actually accepts and uses Bitcoin as a
[15:22] whole what are some challenges that uh
[15:25] that African faces in adopting Bitcoin I
[15:28] I I always hear as answer scams I feel
[15:32] like there's a lot of a lot of scams
[15:34] going on but besides the scams maybe
[15:38] what what what are some challenges that
[15:39] that you see in adopting
[15:41] Bitcoin so probably infrastructure um
[15:45] when it comes to internet
[15:47] penetration um I would say that is one
[15:50] of the biggest challenges that we have
[15:52] you know electricity as well which
[15:55] matters when you want to you know be
[15:57] able to be 24/7 online right um but
[16:01] luckily we do have projects and
[16:03] innovators such as um Kat of machura who
[16:07] came up with this really cool tool that
[16:10] uses um we can be able to send value
[16:13] that is Bitcoin using a ussd platform so
[16:16] whether you have the internet or not you
[16:18] can actually be able to send and receive
[16:20] Bitcoin which is really cool but then uh
[16:23] there are some countries in Kenya we are
[16:25] lucky because you are considered as um
[16:27] the technology hub of Africa um so when
[16:31] it comes to certain infrastructure we
[16:33] actually luy but when you move outside
[16:35] and that is just Nairobi when you move
[16:37] outside of Nairobi then that becomes a
[16:39] problem right so I feel that would be
[16:42] the biggest challenge the other
[16:43] challenge would be
[16:45] education um we have been and I feel
[16:49] this is like Global it's not just
[16:51] African countries most of us and all all
[16:54] of us have this Bank mentality where we
[16:58] we rather trust somebody else with our
[17:01] money other than ourselves so the
[17:03] biggest thing is to you know help people
[17:07] and learn that that you can actually you
[17:09] know have Financial sovereignity by
[17:12] keeping your keys by keeping your own
[17:14] money right so education is is is is one
[17:19] of the things that I would say is a big
[17:21] problem getting to the Grassroots level
[17:24] and actually meeting people at their own
[17:27] level other than imposing our own ideas
[17:30] and that is one thing I feel that as
[17:33] Bitcoin bitcoiners we need to we need to
[17:36] change meeting people at their own level
[17:38] as opposed to you know trying to push
[17:41] your own opinions or on how you should
[17:44] people should actually use Bitcoin so
[17:47] allowing people to you know use Bitcoin
[17:51] as per their utility yeah it's it's yeah
[17:55] a lot of uh now with with Michael saor
[17:58] that the debates coming up with like
[18:00] self- custody and and how you should use
[18:02] Bitcoin but yeah I think the the the the
[18:05] great thing with Bitcoin is that you
[18:07] have the option to leave it on Exchange
[18:10] to buy an ETF to have it in self-
[18:12] custody you can have your uh I don't
[18:15] know 12 multi signature custody solution
[18:18] or like your free multi signature
[18:21] collaborative custody solution like
[18:23] there are so many options and you can
[18:25] choose yourself and I think that that is
[18:27] really powerful that we have to options
[18:29] um but I want to highlight one thing you
[18:33] said I think uh a lot of the countries
[18:36] that I know that are listening to this
[18:38] because I know uh the the biggest one is
[18:41] America then UK Canada uh Germany and
[18:44] all those those countries that are
[18:45] listening to this podcast uh they have
[18:49] like almost 100% electricity in Internet
[18:52] penetration and you said like you you
[18:54] have in Africa challenges even with like
[18:56] internet and electricity penetration
[18:59] so I think that's a very um a challenge
[19:03] that most of my listeners probably don't
[19:04] even think about when they think about
[19:07] Bitcoin education um how big of a
[19:10] problem is like how what do you know
[19:13] some numbers like what what percentage
[19:15] of the the country or like uh don't have
[19:18] electricity and don't have internet and
[19:20] and then cannot even um access uh
[19:24] Bitcoin I also heard about matching Kura
[19:27] the the service that is really cool
[19:29] to send Bitcoin without an internet
[19:30] connection just with your
[19:32] SMS yeah yeah yeah so yeah you're right
[19:36] uh I some people in this world don't
[19:39] even know how the struggle of having not
[19:41] to have electricity or internet right
[19:45] and I would say one of the countries
[19:47] that suffers from that is Nigeria and
[19:50] also South Africa as well but I feel
[19:52] South Africa they could be improving
[19:55] right now with the new Administration
[19:58] but that is something I would have to um
[20:01] maybe confirm later on um and I won't
[20:05] say I have a specific number but it's a
[20:09] huge problem right it's a it's it's a
[20:12] huge problem the majority of people who
[20:14] have electricity are the ones in urban
[20:17] centers and even those of us who are in
[20:19] urban centers it's not like guaranteed
[20:22] that you're going to have 247
[20:24] electricity or Internet throughout the
[20:26] month or throughout the year who knows
[20:29] um the power could decide to go off
[20:31] right now as we're doing this with this
[20:33] interview right so the numbers are huge
[20:37] I would say that uh the numbers are huge
[20:40] and um yeah that's that's a really big
[20:42] problem for us I just asked uh meanwhile
[20:45] jbt it's not always the best source but
[20:48] it usually gives me some some number
[20:50] better than
[20:51] nothing uh and uh and they're saying 40
[20:55] to 45% of the population uh has no or
[21:00] almost no access to electricity is is
[21:03] that something that that seems
[21:06] reasonable I say I think it's
[21:08] more I I definitely feel it's more um
[21:12] maybe so I say CH GPT might say 40 to
[21:16] 45% because some people have access to
[21:20] electricity but it's not like certain
[21:22] it's not guaranteed right so you might
[21:24] have days that you have electricity you
[21:27] might have days that you don't so that's
[21:28] why I'm saying it can be more than 40 to
[21:31] 45% if you watch or listen to my podcast
[21:34] on a regular basis I'll guess you
[21:36] already bought some Bitcoin and now the
[21:39] most important step is to keep the
[21:41] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware

[22:47] not least I have something completely
[22:49] new for you guys I partnered up with
[22:53] coin vigilante this is the most
[22:55] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[22:58] saw created by anyone look at that
[23:01] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[23:04] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[23:07] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[23:10] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[23:13] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[23:16] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[23:19] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[23:23] watch collections you have the date of
[23:25] the first ever mined Bitcoin block in
[23:28] there and of course also the block
[23:30] height and which Epoch we are currently
[23:34] in I love the level of detail they put
[23:36] in in this masterpiece and make sure to
[23:39] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[23:42] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[23:45] love those watches so so much
[23:48] interesting yeah it's it's so
[23:50] fascinating and that's why I made the
[23:51] podcast in English um a lot of people
[23:54] think that I'm make it in English to
[23:55] reach a bigger audience which is uh
[23:58] really
[23:59] weird argument because there are so much
[24:01] bigger challenges so much bigger um uh
[24:05] channels in German out there than I am
[24:08] so a lot of growth potential in the
[24:10] German Market yeah but the interesting
[24:12] thing is when you get out of this
[24:14] Austria Germany bubble you really see
[24:18] other uh you see a better perspective on
[24:21] on the world and I know it's a big thing
[24:25] in Austria if the electricity isn't
[24:28] there for just a day like it's like oh
[24:31] we don't have electricity I cannot do
[24:33] any like there's like a big outrage when
[24:35] they like for one day in the year
[24:37] there's no electricity uh and I'm always
[24:40] like there are countries where people
[24:42] live they don't have electricity even
[24:44] one day in in a year we we are freaking
[24:49] out if we have one day no electricity
[24:51] exactly exactly and and probably that is
[24:55] why I would say I think more coiners and
[24:59] more people should have um an open mind
[25:03] to understanding how Bitcoin can be used
[25:05] by other people as opposed to imposing
[25:08] their own ideologies right because I've
[25:11] I've seen a lot of fights on Twitter on
[25:13] how people should actually use Bitcoin
[25:16] don't sell your Bitcoin I've seen that
[25:18] don't sell your Bitcoin don't spend your
[25:20] Bitcoin but what happens if I want to
[25:22] send value to somebody in Nigeria and
[25:25] they have a limit to what they can
[25:27] actually withdraw via ATM right so what
[25:31] happens then I would have to use Bitcoin
[25:34] right so like I said the issue with
[25:38] bitcoiners you know always trying to
[25:40] impose their own ideologies you're in
[25:42] your own country you're in your own
[25:44] bubble your probably your monetary
[25:46] system is working perfectly um and then
[25:50] you hear other people are using probably
[25:53] Bitcoin in trades and you're like why
[25:54] the hell are they using Bitcoin they
[25:57] should it for the next 50 years or so
[26:03] right that's really fascinating for me
[26:05] because uh I see it all the time people
[26:08] have their own beliefs completely
[26:10] outside of Bitcoin and put it on bitcoin
[26:13] and then think that everyone else also
[26:15] has to think like that for example about
[26:19] carnivore uh there's a lot of health
[26:21] benefits uh I I get it carnivo is
[26:25] great but we should not expect that
[26:27] every Bitcoin
[26:28] now only eats
[26:31] meat and and and and the same with
[26:34] everything else like there are so many
[26:36] bitcoiners out there with such a strong
[26:38] opinion on things that have nothing to
[26:40] do with Bitcoin and they're like okay
[26:42] now uh like for example weightlifting I
[26:45] do it myself and I think it's great for
[26:47] your body but we it's not a Bitcoin of
[26:50] thing like like if you don't you you you
[26:53] can be a Bitcoin without lifting L
[26:56] weights even even even though it's great
[26:58] to make Sports and even though it's
[26:59] great to lift weights but I think we
[27:01] should stop putting our own beliefs on
[27:04] bitcoin and think that everyone has to
[27:06] have those same beliefs exactly and I I
[27:09] normally say and I tell my community
[27:12] this the reason why I fail the Bitcoin
[27:14] Community isn't growing as much as the
[27:17] crypto Community it's because of these
[27:20] sort of like gatekeeping ideas you know
[27:22] for you to be a bitcoiner you have to be
[27:25] you know go through the carnival diet
[27:28] plan you have to lift weight you have to
[27:31] you know store your wealth in Bitcoin
[27:33] for the next 50 years you have to act a
[27:36] certain way and it
[27:39] actually uh it it brings fear and doubt
[27:43] To None you know non bitcoiners because
[27:46] they're like is this a
[27:48] cult you know why why would I need to do
[27:52] all this like it's crazy it gives them
[27:54] fear why should I get into this if these
[27:57] are the terms and you know it's like we
[27:59] have certain terms and conditions that
[28:01] we have to follow as bitcoiners which is
[28:04] actually not helping us um in actually
[28:08] bringing more people into the Bitcoin
[28:10] space and I would say this if we do want
[28:13] to get to that level of
[28:14] hyperbitcoinization I don't know when
[28:16] this will be but we need to be more
[28:18] open-minded we need to you know allow
[28:21] people to use Bitcoin and have their own
[28:25] lifestyle outside of Bitcoin as they
[28:27] deem fit
[28:29] I I 100% agree I think we have to be uh
[28:33] way more open as a as a community and
[28:36] yes it sometimes seems like a cult I
[28:38] totally understand that but it's but
[28:40] it's also maybe a feature of it because
[28:43] uh we really uh holding together
[28:46] strongly like the the strong Community
[28:48] aspect even it it seems like gatekeeping
[28:50] and it it's it's it's interesting for me
[28:53] to to have this discussion because it's
[28:56] we have so many big uh bitcoiners in the
[29:00] scene uh that have really strong beliefs
[29:03] and put it on bitcoin and I think that's
[29:05] wrong but at the same time it's it's
[29:08] things that unites us for for some
[29:10] reason uh and then uh I was actually at
[29:13] Bitcoin Amsterdam and was asked by
[29:15] Isabella uh what you because I
[29:18] interviewed almost now 300 Bitcoin as
[29:20] and she asked me oh you inter
[29:22] interviewed now almost 300 bitcoiners
[29:24] what is a bitcoiner and I gave this long
[29:27] long speech
[29:28] about what bitcoiners think and then I
[29:30] ended my my thing with like oh Bitcoin
[29:33] is a human being like that's that's the
[29:36] only thing that unites all bitcoiners we
[29:39] are all human beings that that's the
[29:41] only thing that actually unites us
[29:44] exactly and I feel for one thing uh one
[29:47] thing that actually Satoshi Nakamoto
[29:49] really thought about is the human race
[29:53] as opposed to a specific niche of people
[29:56] because Bitcoin does not discriminate
[29:58] discriminate against you know your race
[30:00] your gender your geographical location
[30:03] even your own econom um your social
[30:06] status it gives everybody a platform to
[30:09] start from wherever they can and um you
[30:12] know grow from wherever they can so for
[30:15] us to come with these strong ideologies
[30:19] then it beats the point um of what
[30:23] Satoshi nakamoto's dream was which is
[30:25] bringing humans together to get that one
[30:28] goal which is Financial Freedom and if
[30:30] you don't have Financial Freedom then
[30:33] you're basically a slave to the system
[30:36] and the system is the enemy not the next
[30:39] person that's that's really cool um what
[30:42] do you think with with that keep with
[30:44] keeping that in mind what do you think
[30:45] is the biggest impact that Bitcoin will
[30:48] have on the world once it's successfully
[30:51] really there I think Bitcoin is the
[30:54] greatest educational tool that we have
[30:57] had in that it has for those people
[31:00] whove actually tried to understand what
[31:02] Bitcoin is and the benefits of actually
[31:05] using it um it has opened our eyes to
[31:08] the injustices financial injustices that
[31:11] have been done to us as the human race
[31:13] right uh by our governments by the
[31:16] authorities that are above us and um if
[31:19] we do get to that level then we would
[31:22] not have enemies unless you're just dumb
[31:25] or just thickheaded and you've decided
[31:28] you know this group of people these ones
[31:31] are not supposed to be using Bitcoin
[31:33] right I feel um unifying people would be
[31:38] the biggest the greatest um uh benefit
[31:41] of using Bitcoin and I have seen this
[31:45] while attending conferences you know uh
[31:48] Bitcoin conferences normally bring
[31:49] people from different um conents and
[31:53] when we come together in such conf
[31:55] conferences I have felt people leaving
[31:58] you know their own perception of which
[32:01] click I should be in with and actually
[32:04] they have tried to understand people
[32:07] from the level of hm how do you see
[32:09] Bitcoin how do you view Bitcoin how do
[32:11] you use Bitcoin in your world how do you
[32:14] use Bitcoin for the challenges that you
[32:16] facing so it's a unifying Factor that's
[32:19] a very big deal for me it's a unifying
[32:21] factor and that said I would like to
[32:23] just put this in there we have the
[32:25] African Bitcoin conference so it's a
[32:27] chance for anyone out there who's never
[32:30] been to Africa it's going to be in Kenya
[32:32] at the prestigious hotel which is JW Mar
[32:36] from the 9th to the 11th of December
[32:39] it's a great opportunity to meet African
[32:41] bitcoiners look at the innovations that
[32:43] we've had you know connect and network
[32:46] and just you know uh enjoy Kenya as a
[32:52] country I I love that a lot yeah it's h
[32:55] I think we we have to get to more
[32:57] Bitcoin conferences I think exactly
[33:01] that's something so valuable just like
[33:03] meeting on a local meet up or like on
[33:06] conferences or like however you you do
[33:08] it there are so many different ways meet
[33:11] Bitcoin as in real life it's it's a life
[33:14] hack exactly exactly and you get to
[33:17] collaborate you know you get to exchange
[33:20] ideas you get to learn from others even
[33:23] get to understand wow like I'll I'll
[33:25] give you an example when I attended um
[33:28] Global Bitcoin Summit we had human
[33:30] rights activists so the GBS is done by
[33:33] the Bitcoin Park and hrf and I was
[33:35] fortunate enough to be um to be part of
[33:38] that and listening to the stories by
[33:41] human rights activist I was like wow you
[33:45] know I thought we have problems there
[33:48] are people who actually facing bigger
[33:51] problems and using Bitcoin to actually
[33:54] help you know uh the situation at they
[33:58] facing absolutely uh what are you
[34:00] currently working in in Bitcoin you have
[34:03] the data on uh so what are you doing
[34:06] okay so let me start by explaining what
[34:09] Bitcoin data is so essentially Bitcoin
[34:11] data is um a nonprofit organization that
[34:14] focuses on empowering the African female
[34:17] through financial education and we
[34:19] leverage on bitcoin to do that um mainly
[34:22] because it's decentralized so we do not
[34:24] need the permission of anyone to
[34:26] actually do what we we are doing right
[34:29] um so under Bitcoin daada we have
[34:31] several programs we have like the shirt
[34:34] that I'm wearing Dada devs so that dat
[34:37] devs is um the latest program that we've
[34:40] started and the reason why um I felt
[34:42] this was important is because we have
[34:46] the technically inclined students in our
[34:49] community developers so what we are
[34:51] trying to do is giving already existing
[34:55] African female developers the know to be
[34:58] able to contribute and even build on the
[35:02] Bitcoin ecosystem um we have other
[35:05] programs such as the DAT entrepreneurs
[35:07] so dat entrepreneur basically helps
[35:10] female entrepreneurs in Africa uh
[35:12] integrate Bitcoin into their businesses
[35:15] so it helps them um how does it help the
[35:18] businesses it helps them in expanding
[35:21] their you know expanding their reach to
[35:24] other outside of their communities to
[35:26] other other countries I would give you a
[35:29] very good example of a female who's been
[35:32] able to do this her name is Sarah she's
[35:35] from the community and when she joined
[35:37] Bitcoin Dada it was because she had a
[35:40] client from Nigeria um and she wanted to
[35:44] you know send her some products and the
[35:46] lady was willing to pay her in Bitcoin
[35:49] but Sarah did not have any information
[35:51] about Bitcoin she could not understand
[35:53] what it was and she missed that
[35:54] particular opportunity so couple of
[35:58] months later she came across Bitcoin D
[36:00] and she joined us and she started using
[36:03] Bitcoin so she's been able to expand her
[36:06] business not just in Kenya but also in
[36:09] another country which is Uganda so it
[36:12] helps the students actually or the
[36:13] female entrepreneurs expand their Market
[36:17] Outreach um we have things like um the
[36:22] charma program where we one of our main
[36:25] goals is to ensure every lady in the
[36:28] community owns some percentage of
[36:31] Bitcoin and the reason why this is is
[36:34] important as much as we use Bitcoin to
[36:36] send and receive value we are also
[36:39] trying to you know create wealth for the
[36:41] Next Generation so we do this by dcing
[36:45] you know every week we have some amount
[36:48] of money that we purchase Bitcoin and
[36:51] they're able to do this from as low as
[36:53] $1 so you're given the opportunity to
[36:55] start from whatever amount of money that
[36:57] you want to start so you can start
[36:59] stacking $1 $500 that really depends on
[37:03] you um the other program that we have we
[37:07] do community outreach um so Bitcoin dat
[37:11] essentially is not really like I said
[37:12] it's not for individuals we're trying to
[37:14] make our communities better as well and
[37:16] we are working with underprivileged kids
[37:19] uh specifically in Kenya we work with um
[37:22] a a school in one of the biggest uh
[37:24] slums in Africa which is called kibera
[37:27] and uh what you're trying to do is to
[37:30] eradicate um period poverty so talking
[37:35] about even uh period in in Africa is
[37:38] like a taboo and I think this is across
[37:40] everywhere it's it's it's a topic that
[37:43] people share away from right so what
[37:45] happens with these underprivileged kids
[37:47] they tend to run away from school uh
[37:50] because they cannot afford things like
[37:52] hygiene products such as sanitary towels
[37:55] so we come in by purchasing these
[37:58] sanitary towels and just you know
[37:59] engaging these girls giving them advice
[38:02] and ensuring that they actually stay in
[38:04] school uh we also work with offence of
[38:07] Uganda um which is led by our community
[38:10] manager in in Uganda her name is um EDI
[38:14] P so for Bitcoin data is is more of
[38:18] creating an inclusive environment where
[38:20] everybody can Thrive and succeed at
[38:22] their own
[38:25] level it's a it's a great mission uh a
[38:28] love that we that we have like um almost
[38:33] this it's interesting when we compare
[38:36] it's maybe an interesting question uh it
[38:38] has not not too much to do with that now
[38:41] but when you would have put uh Bitcoin
[38:44] in the polit political corner where
[38:47] where would you put it because I I have
[38:49] I struggle with that question a lot I
[38:51] think I think it's too PR to put it
[38:53] somewhere do you have like an a
[38:55] framework to think about that in what
[38:58] sense I mean there's like a liberal
[39:01] political corner there's a communist
[39:03] political Corner a socialist Corner uh
[39:06] and and for me um it just came up in my
[39:08] mind because we when you talked about
[39:10] that it's like everyone deserves the
[39:13] same chance and this like this debate
[39:15] between like liberals and and and
[39:17] Communists but like Liberals are saying
[39:18] like oh everyone deserves the same
[39:20] chance and communist is more like oh
[39:22] everyone is the same which is not not
[39:24] true for me uh and it and it seems like
[39:27] um Bitcoin is a very liberal but at the
[39:31] same time very
[39:32] conservative um uh thing at the same it
[39:36] was just in my head I'm sorry but it's
[39:38] maybe you have think that I think uh
[39:42] Bitcoin doesn't have like a specific
[39:44] area because I can say we have both
[39:46] extremists you know we have extremists
[39:49] in Bitcoin as well who like I said I
[39:52] just focus on you know stacking stacking
[39:54] stacking stacking stacking stacking the
[39:56] others who believe that you should not
[39:59] even have like Bitcoin in your wallet
[40:02] you should be able to send and send and
[40:03] send and send and send so it has both
[40:06] ends um but I would say the beauty about
[40:08] Bitcoin again it gives us the platform
[40:11] where you can actually use it from your
[40:12] own point of view so you can decide to
[40:14] follow the extremists probably the crazy
[40:17] ones and you can also decide to follow
[40:20] the rest but at the end of the day um I
[40:23] feel if we probably read the Bitcoin
[40:27] white paper and follow satoshi's dream
[40:30] which was peer-to-peer you know currency
[40:34] to bring us hum the human race our
[40:37] Financial Freedom back then we will not
[40:39] have such debates at all love that a lot
[40:41] really cool h on that note um do you
[40:45] think Bitcoin will change something in
[40:47] in our culture in our uh living
[40:51] together I think it it already is um it
[40:56] already is um in terms like I said in
[40:59] terms of unifying people and it not
[41:02] might be for everybody because again we
[41:04] come from different backgrounds
[41:06] different environments um we we've grown
[41:08] from different cultures as well but I
[41:11] feel it's a unifying tool for those who
[41:14] are open you know open-minded or
[41:17] openhearted and it has brought people um
[41:22] whove actually in the normal world in
[41:25] the Fiat system would not even consider
[41:27] working together right so yes it has
[41:31] already started changing the perception
[41:33] of how we see each other as a human race
[41:36] and understanding that um it's not a
[41:39] specific race that's the problem but
[41:42] it's actually the system that is the
[41:44] problem and if there's some a bitcoiner
[41:47] who doesn't see it that way then I don't
[41:49] think they actually understand Bitcoin
[41:50] absolutely very cool um we come to our
[41:53] end routine of the podcast uh where I
[41:55] always ask my guest what can can we
[41:57] learn from you besides Bitcoin what can
[42:00] you learn from me as an individual or
[42:03] from Bitcoin Dada from from you
[42:07] individually um what can you learn from
[42:09] me as an indiv individual
[42:14] resilience I would say and the reason
[42:16] why I'm saying this is I started Bitcoin
[42:19] daada with a group of 20 females who are
[42:22] just friends of my friends I wasn't sure
[42:26] where I would be
[42:28] um probably where we are at now I wasn't
[42:32] sure but I had a goal in mind and that
[42:35] was to bring Financial Freedom and
[42:38] Independence to Africans and I do that
[42:43] by including the African female so if
[42:47] you're out there as a bitcoiner and
[42:49] you're not sure at what capacity you can
[42:51] actually contribute I would say this
[42:54] learn from my story you know start with
[42:57] whatever you have that small idea that
[43:00] you keep on pushing you're like I'm not
[43:01] sure you know I'm not technical you
[43:04] don't really need to be and this is what
[43:05] I normally say you don't have to be
[43:07] technically inclined to actually
[43:09] understand and use Bitcoin and to start
[43:11] contributing there are a lot of ways
[43:13] that you can contribute in this space
[43:15] I've seen artists I've seen lawyers I've
[43:18] seen developers you know I've seen
[43:21] creators I've seen leaders there are
[43:23] very many areas that you can actually
[43:26] contribute at your own capacity and you
[43:29] can even do that not by deciding to
[43:32] impact the lives of millions of people
[43:35] but just by starting with you and your
[43:37] own family start spreading your love uh
[43:40] within your neighborhood and uh with
[43:42] your L ones I think that's a great one
[43:45] exactly and the other thing that I would
[43:47] add I had this conversation um with a
[43:51] friend yesterday and we were talking
[43:53] about the idea of hyper baniz like I
[43:56] said I'm not sure if this is going to
[43:57] happen in uh within this Our Generation
[44:01] could be the next generation or maybe
[44:03] not but if we do want to get to that
[44:06] level as bitcoiners we have to start
[44:08] from the grassroot level we have to
[44:09] start with the next person I mean if you
[44:12] want to come to Kenya and spend Bitcoin
[44:15] then there has to be somebody in Kenya
[44:17] who's actually doing the work right
[44:19] there has to be somebody in Kenya who's
[44:21] actually speaking to their shopkeeper
[44:23] and giving them giving that information
[44:26] that hey why don't you start accepting
[44:28] Bitcoin right so it starts from us as
[44:31] individuals um and not waiting for the
[44:33] governments to actually start accepting
[44:35] Bitcoin it could happen which would be
[44:37] great if the governments would wake up
[44:39] and say okay we are ditching the fiat
[44:41] currency or we are actually
[44:43] incorporating Bitcoin but then it starts
[44:46] from us love that a lot really cool we
[44:49] we have to drive the the Bitcoin
[44:51] adoption we we should not wait for any
[44:54] authority to allow us that we can
[44:57] transac in Bitcoin that's not the
[44:59] Bitcoin EOS uh we should just do it and
[45:02] we should drive the the Bitcoin
[45:04] Innovation I love that a lot really
[45:06] really cool exactly perfect then yeah
[45:08] let's come to the other end routine the
[45:10] last end routine where the previous
[45:12] guest is asking a question for the next
[45:13] guest without knowing who the next guest
[45:15] actually is and the question for you
[45:17] from the previous guest is what is the
[45:19] most unexpected challenge you think we
[45:22] would face in a hyper Bitcoin as world
[45:25] most unexpected change
[45:27] would
[45:29] be um I don't know how to put this but I
[45:32] would say breaking down the borders
[45:35] opening up the borders it would make it
[45:38] easier you know traveling sending
[45:41] information sending data uh sending
[45:44] value would actually make it
[45:46] easier so that's like unexpected change
[45:50] that we should be able well at least for
[45:52] us as Africans it should be one of the
[45:54] biggest change that we'll be able to see
[45:58] absolutely yeah really cool thank you so
