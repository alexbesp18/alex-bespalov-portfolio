[00:00] the Golden Age of any human civilization
[00:02] is predicated on advancments in
[00:04] technology bitcoiners will be the 1% of
[00:07] Economic and political power in the
[00:09] future you our governments simply don't
[00:11] get smaller like they are designed to
[00:13] grow the state needs to be drastically
[00:15] smaller all these governments are in
[00:17] like debt crisises you know they're
[00:19] they're kind of like zombies Walking
[00:20] with the federal rate plus the state
[00:22] ends up being like 50% and so it's like
[00:24] the government's literally taking half
[00:26] of what you earn
[00:29] [Music]
[00:32] fix the money fix the world we we always
[00:34] say that in in Bitcoin and to a certain
[00:36] extent it's true so certain then it
[00:38] might not be true what are your thoughts
[00:40] around
[00:41] that yeah no thank you so much for
[00:43] having me on Robin honored to be here
[00:46] and so I wrote a Blog piece really kind
[00:49] of digging into to what that means you I
[00:51] think that phrase was really kind of
[00:52] popularized by Larry leard and he
[00:55] definitely played a major inspiration in
[00:58] this piece uh you know addition to to
[01:00] Lyn Alden I really kind of pull on those
[01:02] two works like
[01:04] predominantly and yeah this is just kind
[01:07] of like my attempt to contribute back to
[01:09] the Bitcoin ecosystem a little bit you
[01:11] know it's one of the best things about
[01:13] bitcoiners you know they're so generous
[01:15] with their time their knowledge you know
[01:17] pulling people onto the the life raft if
[01:20] you will and
[01:21] so when I sat down to to wrote this
[01:24] piece I had a lot of different you know
[01:26] thoughts kind of on you know based like
[01:29] I said on Lyn and in Larry's work and so
[01:31] really just try to sit down and identify
[01:33] some of the you know Trends I was seeing
[01:36] or elaborate on some of the trends like
[01:38] they've kind of made mainstream and I
[01:42] work in finance my background is in
[01:44] finance and I have an interest in macro
[01:47] specifically you know macroeconomics but
[01:50] I'm certainly not an
[01:51] expert and I'm hesitant to you believe
[01:55] anybody who says they are expert because
[01:57] we're talking arguably about like one of
[01:59] the most
[02:01] elaborate and complex systems in the
[02:03] world right like the global economic
[02:06] order and so I think a lot of times the
[02:09] mistake with macroeconomics is like it's
[02:12] very easy to pick a data point and
[02:15] correlated to data point B you know
[02:17] which you know then equals c and because
[02:20] there's so much data and data points out
[02:22] there you're almost able to like paint
[02:24] your own picture right and so I think
[02:26] you know it's a little bit of a a false
[02:28] prophecy because you know if you
[02:30] correlate enough points like you can you
[02:33] know form your your or your bises come
[02:35] out in those points and you a lot of
[02:38] times there's just too many moving
[02:39] pieces where that that could be lead to
[02:41] lead to air so what I just try to do is
[02:44] like break it down a little more simply
[02:46] like any pleb I think in the you know
[02:48] description of your your show it's like
[02:50] interviewing you know Bitcoin
[02:52] celebrities with plebs I definitely fall
[02:54] on like the pleb side of things right so
[02:56] it's just like try to keep things simple
[02:58] and so you you like any good bitcoiner I
[03:01] try to think of this you know take a
[03:02] first principles approach here and you
[03:05] humans like we thrive on truth and I
[03:10] think structure and you know formality
[03:12] and because of that like we tend to be
[03:14] like creatures of habit and so kind of
[03:17] like the overlying trends and you know
[03:20] philosophies of this article is kind of
[03:22] like the fourth turning thesis uh which
[03:25] Brandon quidam talks a lot about in the
[03:27] Bitcoin space and it's kind of like
[03:30] every you know 80 years or so there's
[03:32] like a turning and this is kind of like
[03:34] most simply I think Illustrated in like
[03:37] kind of the the Trope you it's like
[03:38] strong men create good times good times
[03:40] create weak men weak men create hard
[03:42] times like that's kind of like an easy
[03:44] simple way to think about it and then I
[03:47] kind of overlay Ray doio Doo's like 250
[03:50] year sovereign debt crisis like on top
[03:53] of that so it's like those are kind of
[03:55] like the two macro Trends as opposed to
[03:59] you identifying data specific data
[04:01] points within the macro environment like
[04:03] looking at like the trends and trying to
[04:04] identify where things are moving so
[04:07] taking a little bit more of a 30,000
[04:10] foot View and applying this and so you
[04:13] know in in doing
[04:15] so the hypothesis or thesis for this
[04:18] work is Humanity's fatal flaw is when
[04:20] the superior techn technological
[04:22] civilization centralizes the money right
[04:26] I think there's been a couple empires in
[04:28] the past you know kind of most you know
[04:29] famously Rome became like the
[04:31] technological power de centralizing
[04:33] money and as you can kind of you know
[04:36] see if you kind of overlay the Roman
[04:39] dinari over the course of like a
[04:41] timeline of the Roman Empire as it's
[04:44] failing as it's falling you know the
[04:46] dinari is getting smaller it's less pure
[04:49] and so when that technological
[04:52] civilization centralize the money they
[04:55] introduce all these skewed incentives
[04:56] right and this is kind of like that
[04:58] pattern
[04:59] highlighted or explained through the
[05:01] fourth turning lens rayo's 250 year
[05:05] sovereign debt crisis where we can kind
[05:06] of explain or start to see how history
[05:10] and humans repeat themselves that's a
[05:13] interesting do do you think those Cycles
[05:16] are kind of innevitable we we cannot
[05:18] stop those like rising and falling of
[05:21] the empires of like this uh Hard Times
[05:24] great uh um strongman and stuff like
[05:27] that or I I mean this goes back to what
[05:31] what s is also talking about a lot when
[05:34] you adopt Bitcoin for your company it
[05:37] has a chance to make your company
[05:38] Immortal because it grows uh faster and
[05:42] it it has this amazing core uh which can
[05:46] feed your company forever uh or almost
[05:49] forever um then the question becomes if
[05:53] like there's an Empire now Rising on
[05:56] bitcoin uh and they can kind of Fe beat
[05:59] themselves
[06:01] forever is those are those Cycles ending
[06:05] or is that just like then they will lose
[06:07] the Bitcoin out of laziness and
[06:09] arrogance and the Bitcoin just comes to
[06:12] someone else like the it will not change
[06:14] a
[06:14] lot yeah yeah no it's a it's a very
[06:18] interesting question and probably the
[06:20] question to your credit and so I think
[06:23] it's a little bit of both you know I
[06:25] certainly didn't think it would be
[06:26] possible before a decentralized money
[06:30] like Bitcoin now that a decentralized
[06:32] money exists I think you know we have
[06:35] the potential but you know it kind of
[06:36] comes down to our our human flaws right
[06:39] and so I think the Golden Age of any
[06:41] human civilization is predicated on
[06:44] investments in technology right and the
[06:47] PS I kind of use a simple example it's
[06:49] like Roman Masons created the arch which
[06:51] enabled the aqueduct which led the
[06:53] creation of large cities where people
[06:55] congregated and you know they created
[06:57] like beautiful art right so it's like
[06:59] very you have simple explanation it's
[07:01] like how technology can kind of lead to
[07:03] all these third fourth fifth sixth order
[07:06] effects right and to your point this is
[07:10] like the creatures of habit like humans
[07:12] are technological beings right like I
[07:15] think that is innately you know our our
[07:19] god-given you know gift right so there's
[07:22] never been a human civilization that has
[07:25] flourished in perpetuity but there's
[07:28] always one that starts up after you know
[07:29] the next one fails right so it's like
[07:32] that is you know I think like I said
[07:34] inherent within us right so there tends
[07:36] to be I think you have similar
[07:40] patterns to achieve a golden age right
[07:44] I've kind of laid them out here so kind
[07:45] of like the first phase where it's like
[07:47] the discovery which a technological
[07:49] advancement creates like a Schism in the
[07:51] Paradigm and once there's a Schism
[07:54] ambitious you men usually can like take
[07:56] advantage of that right and now we're
[07:57] kind of Off to the Races we're Ed like
[07:59] the rise where um the civilization you
[08:03] moving fast and breaking things with
[08:05] like the proverbial Tech wisdom goes and
[08:08] while you're on the rise this tends to
[08:09] be like when markets are the most
[08:12] free and in particular you know we look
[08:15] at money which I believe you know is
[08:17] like the base market right money and
[08:20] energy touch everything and so if we
[08:22] just simply think of money as a unit of
[08:25] account or an economic measuring stick
[08:29] when markets are most free capitalists
[08:33] you know I'd love to you know kind of
[08:35] get into capitalism itself on a Bitcoin
[08:37] standard a little more too but
[08:40] capitalists are using markets to
[08:42] organize Capital deploy capital and
[08:45] create more capital or value so the
[08:48] price signals are very clear like in the
[08:50] rise and so while price signals are
[08:53] clear and markets are functioning as
[08:56] they should without skewed incentives or
[08:58] like you know a weight on the scale
[09:01] that's ultimately how we reach like the
[09:02] Golden Age and this is like when the
[09:05] civilization reaches like their
[09:06] technological and moral hype which is an
[09:09] important aspect of this but to your
[09:11] point you know it's like well will
[09:13] bitcoiners get lazy it's like you know I
[09:16] would like to think not but there hasn't
[09:18] been you know human civilization in the
[09:19] past has proven us otherwise and so
[09:22] while humans have great strengths I
[09:24] believe our you know this innate
[09:25] technological being is like arguably our
[09:29] strongest but we you know we also have
[09:31] weaknesses and you know we're F fallible
[09:33] beings and so there there's becomes like
[09:35] this weird social and moral dilemma and
[09:39] again like there's nothing technically
[09:41] wrong with like being technological
[09:43] beings or the technology itself it's
[09:45] like this human aspect that like erods
[09:48] like you know all things good and so
[09:50] when wealth and power they they tend to
[09:53] create like the centralizing effect
[09:55] which I think attracts like the worst
[09:57] type of people on just kind of like
[09:59] broadly categorize these people as like
[10:01] the bureaucrats and that's how I think
[10:03] like a lot of these systems and
[10:04] civilizations like fail over time it's
[10:06] like bureaucrats know this that's why
[10:08] like they are attracted to wealth and
[10:10] power like they don't create you know
[10:12] wealth and power they just try to
[10:15] harness it once it's already been
[10:18] created right so this is kind of where
[10:20] if they can't compete in markets they
[10:23] need to compete in law fair right so
[10:25] it's like once this happens like we
[10:28] we're past adult golden age and like we
[10:30] kind of enter I call it like the
[10:32] debauchery phase where welfare is now
[10:36] the
[10:37] main mechanism for competition among the
[10:40] bureaucratic class has you know
[10:42] congregated around the wealth and power
[10:45] and so if you can't compete in a free
[10:48] and open market you need to make
[10:50] restrictions around the market well one
[10:54] restriction leads to another restriction
[10:56] leads to another restriction we have
[10:57] like this snowballing effect you know
[10:59] specifically in the west I think you
[11:01] know we've been plagued with this where
[11:02] you our governments simply don't get
[11:04] smaller like they are designed to grow
[11:08] uh which you know as a conservative you
[11:10] person myself I appreciate and respect a
[11:13] lot of libertarianism like I'm very
[11:15] antithetical to this idea like I just
[11:17] straight up don't like it right and a
[11:20] lot of the problem tends to be here is
[11:23] when you
[11:25] introduce legislation or laws or
[11:28] anything really to
[11:29] skew markets well you're now skew
[11:32] skewing Market signals right so it it
[11:35] becomes like much more difficult for not
[11:37] only you know capitalists and you know
[11:39] the times of Industry to deploy Capital
[11:43] it becomes harder for everybody to
[11:45] deploy Capital because there's no clear
[11:48] and functioning feedback loop of what
[11:51] real value is right so you're almost
[11:53] kind of forced into like this gambling
[11:55] Society where it's like okay Market
[11:57] signals are so skewed I can't make sense
[12:00] of them there's all this you know
[12:01] regulation you know I kind of commonly
[12:04] refer to like the feds or most like the
[12:08] the Federal Reserve kind of specifically
[12:09] in a lot of situations as like this 800
[12:11] pound gorilla in the room so if they're
[12:13] putting like their finger on the scale
[12:15] and distorting price signals it's like
[12:18] well then you you you simply can't make
[12:20] sense of them and it's like to the point
[12:22] earlier I was making about economic
[12:24] systems like being complex like there's
[12:25] a lot of moving pieces and there's a lot
[12:27] of ways to like put the finger on scale
[12:29] where it's like it just becomes murkier
[12:31] and murkier and murkier and so you end
[12:34] up just like gambling at this point like
[12:35] you're just full on debauchery and
[12:37] you're Cruis into like the fall you know
[12:40] so this is kind of like the the hard
[12:42] times right where it's like the
[12:44] unproductive Manero class has been in
[12:46] charge for so long they've eradicated or
[12:50] nearly eradicated every aspect of the
[12:52] rise like the most true technology the
[12:55] freest markets I think the only way
[12:58] technology comes markets comes to Market
[13:02] is if the market itself has clear price
[13:05] signals because you're ultimately
[13:07] betting some sort of capital making
[13:09] investment that's like what I'm doing
[13:11] now in the present day will be worth
[13:13] more in the future well it's like if you
[13:15] can't accurately make that economic
[13:17] calculation for yourself well you're
[13:19] just betting you know and so that's
[13:21] really no way to to live and the
[13:24] unfortunate thing I think about it too
[13:26] is like you know uh I kind of use like
[13:30] you heard the saying you know the bigger
[13:31] they are the harder they fall yeah
[13:34] absolutely well it's kind of like I
[13:36] think in the the idea or you know
[13:39] applying that to theocracies and
[13:42] civilizations where it's like kind of
[13:43] the bigger they are the longer that can
[13:45] keep the facade going it's like if you
[13:47] have unfettered access to the money
[13:49] printer you really can print over you
[13:51] know a lot of these problems so to kind
[13:53] of what I'm worried about or you know
[13:56] war is probably like too strong of a war
[13:58] but I'm like being cognizant of it's
[14:00] like I'm as bullish on you know Bitcoin
[14:02] as anybody but it's just like you have
[14:05] such an entrenched US dollar system
[14:08] where it's like how long can they keep
[14:09] the music going like it generally takes
[14:12] like a long time for like these
[14:13] organisms to just like die out naturally
[14:16] and certainly you know there are
[14:17] different catalysts that might you know
[14:20] provoke or you know prevent that
[14:22] ultimate you Decay but it generally
[14:25] takes a long time
[14:27] so that's why you know I believe believe
[14:30] Humanity's fatal flaw is when the
[14:31] superior technological civilization
[14:34] centralizes the money because it wasn't
[14:36] the problem with the technology in the
[14:38] first place it's once a power became so
[14:42] great because of the technology
[14:44] bureaucrats came in and started
[14:46] centralizing everything specifically
[14:48] money the base Market that's super
[14:50] interesting also the the inside of like
[14:53] uh the higher the influence of the state
[14:55] is the bigger the state gets the the the
[15:00] big the more likelihood it also has then
[15:03] to disrupt the free market and therefore
[15:07] kind of went go in a different direction
[15:10] that is not good it's really interesting
[15:12] right now we have uh we become we got a
[15:14] new government in Austria and they are
[15:18] proposing uh a lot of expense cuts from
[15:22] the government and I app blot that so
[15:26] much like they are cutting all those
[15:29] climate uh bonuses and climate
[15:32] substitutions that the more left leaning
[15:36] government had uh and introduced in the
[15:38] last five years uh for example you could
[15:40] get very cheaply public transport
[15:43] tickets uh you could uh you actually get
[15:46] a climate bonus which is just like
[15:49] everyone gets money every year uh
[15:53] ranging from like €200 EUR per per
[15:57] person to like I think up to like
[15:59] thousand EUR per person or something
[16:00] like that I'm like how how does this
[16:03] help the climate again if if you just
[16:06] give money to everyone it is was
[16:08] supposed to like the the less uh access
[16:12] you have to public transport the more
[16:14] money you got so I have no clue how this
[16:17] helps the climate uh but yeah uh anyways
[16:20] the point is um we have now government
[16:23] in place that actually understands oh
[16:25] like we are giving way much way more
[16:27] money uh we we have way bigger expenses
[16:30] than income from the taxes so we have to
[16:32] cut expenses of like six billion or
[16:35] something like that like a huge number
[16:36] for such a small uh country and now
[16:39] everyone is like oh I'm don't I don't
[16:41] get that money anymore oh my train
[16:43] ticket will get uh higher and all I'm
[16:46] like that's good like gr like we should
[16:49] not all pay for the train tickets the
[16:51] people that use the train should pay for
[16:54] the train ticket like that like if I
[16:56] don't use the train like we also don't
[16:59] pay everyone for the cars of everyone's
[17:01] so like it does not make sense we should
[17:03] not make like a huge mother and father
[17:06] State out of our state so I actually
[17:09] think it's a very nice direction we're
[17:11] going right now in austa gives me a lot
[17:12] of Hope what the government is proposing
[17:15] honestly like they're very conservative
[17:17] uh and making really good decisions
[17:19] right now um even though they con uh
[17:22] very controversial right now but I love
[17:24] what they're doing um but I guess people
[17:28] don't like if you give them money first
[17:30] and then
[17:31] get put it away again is that kind of
[17:34] also the the difficult thing of like if
[17:36] you make the state bigger and bigger
[17:38] it's kind of hard to scale back because
[17:40] people get used to that big state of
[17:43] that no absolutely thank you for the the
[17:45] background there there's a a couple
[17:47] really good points I want to double
[17:48] click into a little bit there and so
[17:50] it's like I mean we kind of have
[17:51] something similar happening you know in
[17:53] the the US with like Doge and stuff
[17:55] which is like you know on face value I'm
[17:58] excited about that obviously I think
[18:01] like the state needs to be drastically
[18:03] smaller you know probably like a small
[18:05] government maximalist if you will so
[18:07] it's like I'm excited to see some of
[18:10] these things don't get me wrong but when
[18:12] it comes to politics I I kind of like to
[18:15] think of myself more as a student of
[18:17] like the the Whitney web you know School
[18:19] thought on this where it's like
[18:21] specifically in the west I think we have
[18:22] a tremendously bad habit I'm not sure if
[18:26] it's like this in Europe as much but
[18:29] it's like we just like we think like
[18:31] we're going to like these political
[18:32] saviors are coming and it's like oh if
[18:34] we just get the right guy office and you
[18:36] know it's like Trump where it's like
[18:39] like him more than I don't but he has
[18:41] like this cult like you know following
[18:42] where it's like he's just gonna fix
[18:44] everything it's like I just don't think
[18:46] that's that's true right I don't think
[18:48] that's that's true of like any
[18:49] politician and
[18:51] so I I just like say that as to put like
[18:56] maybe some expectations or like let's
[18:58] let's measure how we're like feeling
[19:00] about these things like appropriately
[19:01] because like while that is exciting to
[19:03] see things heading in what I believe is
[19:05] the the right direction like I also love
[19:09] Lyn alden's Mee where it's like you know
[19:10] nothing stops these TR this trend you
[19:12] know it's like all these governments are
[19:13] in like dead cres you know they're
[19:15] they're kind of like zombies walking so
[19:17] it's like I don't know how successful
[19:20] like the Austrian government is going to
[19:21] be cutting I don't know how successful
[19:23] doge is going to be
[19:25] cutting but a little bit helps but it's
[19:28] like the fact of matter is like we
[19:30] probably need like way more Absolut like
[19:32] the US de situation is getting like
[19:35] drastically out of control and then you
[19:37] know we have all these unfunded
[19:40] liabilities through our welfare you know
[19:42] system Social Security Medicare Medicade
[19:45] and to your point about like once you
[19:48] know you've kind of you know the
[19:51] proverbial like given in just take a
[19:53] mile it's like once you kind of have
[19:55] people like dependent on the government
[19:58] it it is very hard to you know pull that
[20:01] away and I actually think like this is
[20:04] like more evil than like what bitcoiners
[20:08] want to give a credit for I think
[20:10] there's you know a lot of great
[20:11] bitcoiners that you know help educate me
[20:14] and you know the the whole ecosystem on
[20:17] you know the money is you know
[20:17] structurally broken and all that is good
[20:19] but I think we need to do a little bit
[20:21] better job of like calling a spade a
[20:23] spade because kind of like what I was
[20:25] saying you know earlier it's like when
[20:28] you sort markets and you
[20:31] remove somebody's individual agency from
[20:34] them I think that is inherently evil
[20:36] because our Free Will is like a gift
[20:37] from God right so you
[20:40] removed and denied a market participant
[20:43] which is a human from the ability to
[20:46] make you know clear conscious data
[20:49] driven you know decisions because you've
[20:50] made like the market so Murphy and I
[20:54] think like a lot of our social problems
[20:56] today you know specifically across the
[20:58] West like deatha to spair at least in
[20:59] the US I I find it hard to imagine if
[21:02] like Europe's not on a similar Trend was
[21:04] like drastically Rising so it's like
[21:07] suicide alcohol drug
[21:09] overdose and I think a lot of this kind
[21:11] of comes from like those distortions of
[21:14] markets and like I was saying like the
[21:15] debauchery and fall because when you
[21:18] like when somebody has to just like
[21:20] guess and they can't make
[21:23] decisions on some sort of like factual
[21:25] or truth based you know decision
[21:29] mechanism they lose their individual
[21:31] agency and that that's like very
[21:33] humiliating you feel like your rights
[21:35] have been like stripped from you and
[21:36] that's why I think like it creates like
[21:39] this sense of Despair right and that's
[21:42] just like really corrosive over a long
[21:45] period of time especially when it's
[21:47] really hard to articulate like what
[21:49] exactly is the problem here right it's
[21:52] like it's not very obvious on the
[21:54] surface that you have the money is
[21:56] broken especially like if you aren't in
[21:58] Bitcoin and so yeah it's like climate
[22:01] this public transportation that it's
[22:03] like the more you've like influenced the
[22:06] market the act and like to your points
[22:08] like the more despair you actually
[22:11] created absolutely that's why I I always
[22:14] try to figure out when I have a voting
[22:17] decision and election I always try to
[22:18] figure out who who's that person who's
[22:20] that party that argues for Less
[22:23] government for cutting expenses for
[22:27] lowering taxes for like who's that guy
[22:30] and I voted for already four different
[22:32] parties in Austria because it's not
[22:35] always the same like it's not that like
[22:37] that one government and not that one
[22:40] party that wants have less uh government
[22:42] it's like it it's changing a little bit
[22:44] which is frustrating but right now it's
[22:46] actually the the biggest party in
[22:48] Austria wants to lower taxes and cut
[22:51] expenses at the same time which is
[22:53] amazing to see uh other par is because
[22:58] other part is it's so funny how it goes
[23:00] like we we saw uh and I think it's
[23:03] probably in a lot of counts right now we
[23:05] saw that the depth is growing so uh the
[23:08] socialist government uh parties said oh
[23:11] yeah like we have a bigger Dept uh so we
[23:15] have to increase our
[23:17] income as a company yes you're right
[23:21] like if if you if your costs are rising
[23:24] and you don't have enough income you
[23:26] should make more marketing or whatever
[23:28] to increase your income but as a
[23:32] state that's not good because uh I mean
[23:36] first of all there's like a point where
[23:38] if you hire I forgot what's the name is
[23:41] maybe you know it if you hire the taxes
[23:42] more above that point you actually lower
[23:45] your total income as a state because
[23:48] people are fleeing or taking other
[23:50] routes and and don't pay all the taxes I
[23:52] forgot how this point in in the tax
[23:54] thing is called but it's around like 40%
[23:56] of tax uh rate overall where like if you
[24:00] raise it to like 50 60 70% it doesn't it
[24:03] actually uh your in tax income and total
[24:06] tax income even though they high taxes
[24:09] goes down because people don't pay that
[24:11] much of taxes they either move or they
[24:14] cheat there a lot of interesting studies
[24:16] on on that do you know how that point is
[24:18] called buing ex chance yeah I don't I
[24:21] don't I know what you're you're
[24:22] referencing the Name Escapes me as well
[24:24] but yeah this like Capital flight you
[24:26] know it's kind of like the the trend
[24:27] that there is like very famous you know
[24:29] example of this happening in France and
[24:31] they end up actually like reversing it
[24:33] but you're totally right and this really
[24:36] is kind of like my main beef with you
[24:38] know Central planners and you know
[24:40] specifically you know socialism is like
[24:43] the worship of man right so it's like
[24:45] I'm Catholic that guides my moral
[24:48] worldview so it's like when you have
[24:51] this growing government these growing
[24:53] bureaucratic classes they enact Central
[24:56] planning you know as much as they can
[24:58] it's like we are better allocators of
[25:01] capital and your wealth than you are
[25:04] which is like never once been true I
[25:07] would say in like the hist history of
[25:09] humanity it's like and this is you know
[25:11] kind of the correlation to to Bitcoins
[25:12] like markets and people thrive when
[25:14] there's like most peer-to-peer
[25:16] interaction and there's not like some
[25:18] third party Tyrant injecting themselves
[25:21] into the equation and so it's like we
[25:24] just have like this continuous worship
[25:25] of man it's like socialism it's like
[25:27] nothing is above the state you know it's
[25:30] like that's nothing is above you know
[25:32] man like worship us we will continue to
[25:34] grow we will continue to look out for
[25:35] you and it's like no there's never been
[25:38] like a socialist society that has has
[25:40] thrived they always end up creating or
[25:43] leading to human suffering which is kind
[25:46] of my point earlier about calling a
[25:47] spade a spade like that's evil you know
[25:49] it's like it's Bitcoin it's like well
[25:51] social it's like antithetical to bitcoin
[25:54] thank goodness but it's like we need to
[25:56] Marty Marty bent has has this great line
[25:59] is like we need to bring back like
[26:00] standards and taboos where it's like if
[26:03] you understand Bitcoin and free market
[26:07] you know kind of like the Austrian
[26:08] School of Economics you know free market
[26:10] principles that enables you know I'm a
[26:13] firm believer like capitalism has
[26:15] influenced like or is responsible for
[26:18] like the most human flourishing like
[26:20] known to man the opposite of that system
[26:23] is socialism which you I think we can
[26:26] clearly point to like the most suffering
[26:28] it's like Communist Revolution in China
[26:31] hundreds of million people you know
[26:33] killed the you know Stalin and communist
[26:36] regimes in Russia it's like hundreds of
[26:40] thousands if not millions of you know
[26:41] people killed so it's like there's just
[26:44] such a clear line to me and I think
[26:46] because you know I have a moral view
[26:49] rooted in truth it's like it's very easy
[26:52] for me to identify good and evil and
[26:55] it's like if we just kind of like frame
[26:57] it through that context you know Michael
[26:59] shamberger was recently on Tucker
[27:02] Carlson podcast and they were just
[27:03] talking about like the fires in
[27:04] California and like this bloated
[27:07] bureaucratic like government the
[27:10] socialist government like not actually
[27:12] performing the functions they are paid
[27:14] to do or to serve the people and it's
[27:17] like nobody looks at this through like a
[27:18] theological end or lens was like their
[27:21] point and so I think if you kind of
[27:22] apply that to this instance it's like
[27:25] it's it's very clear to me it's like
[27:27] what is good what is bad and clearly we
[27:29] shouldn't support the bad we should
[27:30] propagate the good I just wanna yeah
[27:32] totally a great Point um I I just want
[27:35] to give that to people uh so people know
[27:38] what what we were talking about it's
[27:40] really interesting the concept of the
[27:42] laa curve uh uh where when you hit a
[27:46] rate um you actually get lower tax and
[27:49] they're still really high I I asked then
[27:52] also what the rates are and it it shows
[27:54] like around 50 to
[27:56] 70% where 50% of income tax it's it's
[28:00] like for corporate debts 20 to 30%
[28:03] obviously because corporate uh
[28:05] corporations uh move quicker and overall
[28:09] taxes uh shouldn't exceed 30 to 40% of
[28:13] GDP which is if you look at the uh tax
[28:16] rates actually all over the world this
[28:18] is usually the rate right like the
[28:20] highest income tax rates in austri I
[28:22] think is like
[28:24] 55% um and corporate tax rate I think
[28:27] right now is like like 10 102% I think
[28:29] it's probably similar in in America if
[28:31] I'm not mistaken is it is it like that
[28:35] so the the top federal tax bracket is
[28:37] 35% and then you have state income taxes
[28:40] as well and so a little bit different in
[28:43] the the us and this could be a good
[28:46] segue to some of the other things I want
[28:48] to chat with you about but you know it's
[28:49] kind of like you know United States
[28:53] sometimes referred to as you know kind
[28:54] of a conglomeration of like 50 little
[28:56] countries and you know inside of once so
[28:58] each state has different tax laws
[29:00] California specifically with you know
[29:02] the federal rate plus State yeah ends up
[29:04] being like 50% and so it's like the
[29:07] government's literally taking half of
[29:09] what you earn and they can't they it's
[29:12] just time and time again you know we've
[29:13] been failed so like when they've been
[29:15] called on you the fire is kind of being
[29:16] like the latest example you they
[29:19] consistently don't fulfill or hold up
[29:22] like they're under the bargain so again
[29:24] in kind of the the spirit of calling
[29:27] spade a spade that's theft it's like
[29:29] that money is taken from you and you
[29:31] didn't get what was promised in return
[29:33] absolutely um is now uh to bring it back
[29:37] to bitcoin is Bitcoin now kind of
[29:39] enforcing more capitalism uh smaller
[29:42] States is is that kind of the system
[29:44] which if you take away or highly limit
[29:49] the amount of money that you can bring
[29:51] or maybe completely take away that power
[29:53] for governments is that automatically
[29:56] and organically then forcing small small
[29:58] states and more
[30:00] capitalism I think so and like I said
[30:04] earlier know I just try to think of
[30:06] things in like markets as much as I can
[30:09] just because that makes most sense to me
[30:11] right or it's like we have two
[30:14] participants they're each taking you
[30:16] know like a side of trade Bitcoin you
[30:20] know is the most sound money man has
[30:23] ever known right and a lot of like the
[30:26] problems in our current Society occur
[30:29] and like we mentioned because like the
[30:30] base Market money is manipulated Bitcoin
[30:34] is you can't can't manipulated like
[30:36] there's no Central party no Central
[30:39] Authority that you know can come in and
[30:43] skew this market so you know it's a
[30:46] decentralized open source protocol you
[30:48] know if there's any changes to the
[30:50] protocol like that has to be agreed upon
[30:52] by you know consensus of the network and
[30:55] so I think if we just start from a more
[30:58] solid foundation we're going to keep
[31:01] like reaping the benefits you know as
[31:03] Society scales on top of that of
[31:07] more transparency and so Market
[31:09] participants at that that point will
[31:11] just have like that economic Clarity you
[31:14] know back in their lives where it's like
[31:15] okay if the base Market isn't
[31:18] manipulated I can as a market
[31:20] participant make a more informed and
[31:23] data driven economic
[31:25] betet there's somebody ultimately on the
[31:28] other side of that bet that's what all
[31:29] markets are to down to so it's like you
[31:32] very well could be be wrong and that's
[31:34] fine like there's nothing wrong with
[31:36] that moral story is you could take in
[31:39] information and make the decision
[31:42] without the with uh with more
[31:46] transparency and like without all the
[31:47] the murkiness that exists in our current
[31:50] base Market the money interesting is
[31:53] that kind of where um what do you mean
[31:58] what what you mean with Bitcoin urbanism
[32:00] is is like what what is the concept
[32:02] behind that because I never heard about
[32:04] Bitcoin urbanism yeah yeah no this is
[32:06] like kind of a a big pass for M I'm like
[32:08] a hobbyist city planner which just means
[32:11] I've watched like a bunch of YouTube
[32:12] videos on like City Planning and stuff
[32:14] and like building um so I think Bitcoin
[32:18] is much of a monetary and economic tool
[32:23] for change is is a or instrument of
[32:25] change is a social instrument of change
[32:28] and so I've only been to Europe once but
[32:31] I just like have this great reverence
[32:32] for the cities over there because we had
[32:36] this really bad idea in America where
[32:38] it's like kind of post World War II kind
[32:41] of like the global economic power year
[32:43] we have the rise of automobiles and
[32:46] America you know it's a very large
[32:48] country right so we thought it'd be like
[32:50] a really good idea to literally bulldo
[32:53] our cities and create highways and you
[32:58] we went from can I share my my screen
[33:00] with you I have a couple pictures that
[33:02] might hey you should be able to
[33:04] screenshot if if not you can uh send it
[33:07] to me and I will uh screen share this is
[33:09] uh from the I partnered up with coin

[35:19] how you can level up your
[35:22] sovereignty uh Bitcoin urbanism
[35:25] presentation I did at the
[35:29] CU Boulder Bitcoin Club here let see if
[35:34] I can get this a little bigger but you
[35:35] know moral story it's like cities are
[35:38] designed for humans right that's where
[35:40] you we've always shown a you know
[35:42] propensity to trade to grow the exchange
[35:46] of ideas exchange of goods like we're
[35:48] we're social beings you know as well so
[35:50] it's like I think you humans inherently
[35:52] like to be you know around other humans
[35:55] like the unfortunate reality is like
[35:58] this is Kansas City in 1955 like this is
[36:00] Kansas City in 2014 so you can see like
[36:02] we literally destroyed the urban core of
[36:05] Kansas City to build a series of
[36:09] Highways and
[36:10] so couple perverse incentives here and
[36:13] why you know I think
[36:14] Bitcoin is going to help us here
[36:18] so this is like a side effect of unsound
[36:21] money I believe it's Jeff boo that said
[36:23] that but it's like when the money isn't
[36:25] scarce it will flow to scarce assets a
[36:27] majority of the time in America that's
[36:30] real estate most Americans hold a
[36:32] predominant amount of their wealth in
[36:34] their home right well that that's it's
[36:36] not really the point of a home like a
[36:38] home is supposed to you know serve as
[36:40] utility and place to live and raise your
[36:42] family so when it's turned into a
[36:45] financial instrument you get the exed
[36:47] incentives to like build more cheap
[36:50] crappy homes because at like the money
[36:54] is
[36:55] constantly increasing so cost of
[36:58] production it was constantly increasing
[37:02] and so you have to try to find ways you
[37:04] know if you're a builder of homes to you
[37:06] know cut corners and you know most homes
[37:08] in America I think are like this
[37:10] compilation of like glue and plastic
[37:13] like new homes so it's like you know we
[37:15] don't have copper piping anymore it's
[37:17] literally just flexible plastic tube so
[37:19] the quality has gone down and the the
[37:22] prices gone up so we because the the
[37:25] money isn't scarce like we've been forc
[37:27] to invest in scarce things which is real
[37:29] estate and then again kind of circling
[37:32] back to like the central planning
[37:34] Point like my second favorite Central
[37:37] planners to like bag on besides the
[37:39] Federal Reserve are like city planners
[37:42] and so there's like a lot of layers in
[37:43] the US there's like cities local mun
[37:47] municipalities counties States and so
[37:49] you just get like bureaucrats like
[37:51] layered on top of bureaucrats and you
[37:53] there's different like zoning laws here
[37:56] you know so it's like you can only build
[37:58] xire Z you know in this specific
[38:00] District as opposed to like the free
[38:02] market you know determining in it itself
[38:06] so we destroyed our cities to build like
[38:10] the sprawling network of you know
[38:12] Suburbia which is like I said blue and
[38:14] and plastic homes and but people want to
[38:17] buy those homes because they you know
[38:19] see as like the American dream you know
[38:20] like the white picket fans like let me
[38:22] buy this home build equity and you know
[38:25] I'll ultimately be able to sell it for
[38:27] more than I did you go 30 years down the
[38:29] road mortgage markets are obviously like
[38:32] really you know manipulated by the
[38:34] federal government as well this is like
[38:36] post all you know 2008 after the great
[38:39] you know financial crisis where you know
[38:42] the government stepped in and um you
[38:45] know bought up all like these these
[38:47] mortgage companies and so it's like you
[38:49] don't get like the market rate on a
[38:51] mortgage and real estate itself is like
[38:53] a hyper local market as well like it
[38:55] pays to be on one side of the track as
[38:57] opposed to the others so again like you
[38:59] just layer all this like levels of
[39:01] bureaucracy on it but there's also
[39:03] something um
[39:06] morally you're wrong with this I have
[39:08] like this antisocial Behavior so it's
[39:10] like in cities and like I think you see
[39:13] this really well in Europe like there's
[39:15] some sort of like Central Town Square
[39:17] like where people are meant to interact
[39:19] with each other it's like well if you
[39:21] destroy that build a highway you sit in
[39:23] a steel box for an hour driving into
[39:25] town to work you work in your down
[39:27] office from 9: to 5 you get in your
[39:29] steel box you drive back to the suburbs
[39:31] like you actually interacted with like
[39:33] hardly anybody besides maybe your
[39:35] co-workers and the guy who bought a
[39:36] sandwich from at lunch it's like well
[39:39] you're just constantly isolating people
[39:41] and like this is like a very sad
[39:44] statistic where it's like 68% of people
[39:46] you know Drive alone to work and that's
[39:49] not actually how I think Bitcoin works
[39:52] you know while it is an internet native
[39:53] protocol so you know you and I don't
[39:55] need to know each other to you know
[39:57] interact with the Bitcoin protocol it's
[39:59] actually you know a very important and
[40:02] useful point of the protocol but the
[40:04] fact of the matter is it's a
[40:05] peer-to-peer
[40:06] protocol so it's like people are meant
[40:08] to be interacting with each other I
[40:10] think in all aspects of life and not so
[40:13] so isolated Alan so kind of a
[40:15] combination of ways you thought where
[40:17] it's like Bitcoin can fix the incentive
[40:20] problem and like store values like your
[40:22] home should be like the store value but
[40:24] it also like in inherent with within
[40:27] like the ethos and kind of like the
[40:29] characteristics of Bitcoin it's like
[40:31] actually meant to pull people together
[40:33] and this maybe like a good Segway into
[40:35] like the space and like third spaces and
[40:37] like America you know many of our third
[40:39] places were destroyed so we're kind of
[40:40] leading leading to like this low trust
[40:43] society as opposed to like a high trust
[40:45] society which I think you know Bitcoin
[40:47] can help
[40:48] facilitate I love that it's it's
[40:52] something I mean in Europe it's a whole
[40:54] different situation uh uh it's very
[40:58] if you for example live in Vienna I live
[41:02] uh since like like eight months now in
[41:05] Vienna I had a car before uh and I was
[41:10] like I don't need a car right now like
[41:12] if I want to go somewhere far I anyways
[41:15] take the plane uh and I'm quite close to
[41:17] the the airport even not quite close but
[41:20] like in like 30 40 minutes with the
[41:22] public transport I'm there like which is
[41:24] really convenient uh if I want to go
[41:27] somewhere in Austria to my family
[41:30] there's a train always going and the
[41:32] train is usually uh
[41:35] faster and more convenient because I can
[41:38] sit in a train I don't have to drive
[41:41] myself there I can actually work and
[41:43] like I mean if then self drive car self
[41:47] driving cars come maybe that's a
[41:49] different story maybe that's the more
[41:51] convenient and you have like your kind
[41:53] of office space on roads and in Vienna
[41:56] uh most of the things anyways I go just
[41:59] by fo foot like just going there I don't
[42:01] even take any transportation which is
[42:03] really nice I'm going a lot I can go to
[42:06] my swimming uh in in in a pool there I
[42:09] can go to my groceries there's like in
[42:11] in five minutes walking distance uh what
[42:14] is it uh six different
[42:17] supermarkets so like it it's really like
[42:20] there's a lot going on uh and like
[42:22] coffees and restaurants and everything
[42:24] like that and if I want to go a little
[42:25] bit further the um underground uh trains
[42:31] uh I don't know how how are they
[42:32] actually called yuban in in German but I
[42:34] have no clue how they are called in in
[42:36] English uh they're going everywhere in
[42:38] the city and it's super fast you you
[42:41] within the city you you have to do never
[42:43] go to a car because it's it's slower and
[42:47] you stay in traffic all day long so um
[42:51] that's kind of the the thing what you
[42:52] meant with like you walk more in in
[42:56] urban areas there's like a a space where
[42:59] only humans are allowed to walk you're
[43:02] not allowed to drive with the bicycle
[43:04] you're not allowed to drive with the the
[43:06] C there it's just like a walking area
[43:08] huge walking area which also where the
[43:10] the stores usually at is that kind of
[43:13] the the vision you you're talking with
[43:16] like on a Bitcoin standard it would look
[43:18] like with like more closeness uh to
[43:22] people also public transport is like
[43:23] where people are closer together because
[43:26] you literally in in a
[43:29] trainera yeah absolutely I'm actually so
[43:32] envious of that man like you have no
[43:33] idea um my kind of like urbanist like
[43:36] hot take you know for the US is like
[43:39] there's a lot of conversation like
[43:40] High-Speed Rail like connecting cities
[43:42] to cities I actually don't think that's
[43:45] extremely feasible or very feasible in
[43:48] the US just because it is like so
[43:50] physically big and it's like these are
[43:51] very long distances to travel but within
[43:55] a city I can be more Pro public
[43:58] transportation and what I got on the
[44:01] screen here is like this is Spokan
[44:04] Washington so it's like a small City you
[44:06] know in the US like all these colored
[44:08] squares are either surface parking lot
[44:10] or garage parking for cars it's like
[44:13] again cities are supposed to be for
[44:14] people we've destroyed our cities to you
[44:17] know be for for cars and what I think
[44:19] this really is is like these are
[44:22] economic like these are economic scars
[44:24] right so we've took economically viable
[44:27] land and destroyed it and then rebuilt
[44:31] again for depreciating asset you know
[44:34] that to me doesn't make much sense I
[44:37] don't think that's a smart economic
[44:39] calculation while everything takes some
[44:42] level of Main and like you know a coffee
[44:45] shop with you know two or three stories
[44:48] of Apartments is much more economically
[44:51] vibrant than a surface parking lot why
[44:55] is this entire city surface parking lots
[44:58] so I think you know just given kind of
[45:00] the Low Time preference of Bitcoin like
[45:04] this I think these decisions were made
[45:07] under a Fiat mindset I think all of this
[45:09] is Fiat where it's like we build all
[45:12] this very expensive infrastructure like
[45:15] it takes a lot of money to upkeep a
[45:18] sprawling network of Highways like these
[45:21] are and cars and car infrastructure like
[45:23] these are all depreciating assets so
[45:25] it's like the for further you stretch
[45:29] the or you know expand past the economic
[45:31] core like the greater physical distance
[45:35] you are
[45:36] expecting economic return and so you're
[45:39] really kind of like squeezing everything
[45:42] out of that equation and it's like your
[45:45] Roi your return on the investment
[45:47] becomes lower and lower and ultimately
[45:49] you know a lot of times it's just
[45:51] straight up negative and you know these
[45:53] are very expensive projects they keep
[45:56] getting Bor more expensive so it's a lot
[45:59] of this is actually just facilitated by
[46:00] you know printed money so I think on a
[46:02] Bitcoin standard like we're going to be
[46:04] forced to be better stewards of our
[46:06] resources and make investments that have
[46:08] a positive Roi which you know I think
[46:11] will just lead to Greater human
[46:15] prosperity and to touch you know again
[46:17] on your point about people being
[46:19] together I think that's extremely
[46:21] important to a high trust Society I
[46:23] think like inherently a Fiat Society
[46:27] Trends towards like no trust because you
[46:30] know every like I was saying earlier
[46:32] everybody's feeling kind of the sense of
[46:34] Despair they understand there's a
[46:36] problem but they can't pinpoint it and
[46:39] because they can't like pinpoint it
[46:40] articulate it those frustrations end up
[46:43] getting uh I think you know
[46:47] unfortunately uh you know shown or like
[46:50] put out on our neighbors like we're
[46:52] frustrated with like somebody else
[46:53] because we we can't identify like where
[46:55] the problem is is coming from so I think
[46:57] if you just like bring people together
[47:00] almost I don't want to say Force but
[47:01] they just like inherently spend more
[47:03] time together you in
[47:06] increase the level of trust within a
[47:08] society and like Bitcoin facilitates
[47:10] this better than anything else right
[47:12] because there's no Central planner or
[47:14] Central authority to bitcoin it all
[47:16] relies on you know it's like you don't
[47:19] trust verify right so if we have a
[47:21] single source of truth it's like we can
[47:23] build trust you know on top of that and
[47:25] have more you know confidence and a
[47:27] higher trust Society like with our
[47:29] neighbors and and interacting with each
[47:31] other and uh funny you mentioned Vienna
[47:36] because I mean we got to talk about this
[47:38] Fountain man it's like what is this you
[47:41] know it's like this is like I think the
[47:43] most perfect representation of like a
[47:45] high time preference Society in a Fiat
[47:48] Society versus a low time preference
[47:50] society and you know a more sound money
[47:53] Society or it's like why did we stop
[47:56] building you know beautiful things I
[47:57] think it's a little bit of a humiliation
[47:59] ritual specifically in the US you know
[48:01] it's like you see all these government
[48:02] buildings that were built with NE know
[48:05] tax dollars you know you could argue
[48:07] sold money printed money and they're
[48:10] just like brutalist ugly things and it's
[48:13] like demeaning you know it's like why
[48:16] aren't our hard-earned economic
[48:19] resources going to build beautiful
[48:21] things that Inspire hope and so I think
[48:25] there's like kind of little more
[48:27] esoteric and philosophical but just such
[48:29] a beautiful Bitcoin you know analogy in
[48:31] that is that wait uh I is that
[48:36] Shun in in Austria I'm almost postive
[48:39] it's in in Austria I thought it was
[48:41] Vienna but no I I I'm I think uh wait
[48:46] wait can you stop sharing Then I then I
[48:48] quickly can can share that I think
[48:50] that's actually where my running route
[48:54] is let me
[48:58] like so that's Shan Brun Shen Brun the
[49:02] and and that's exactly that one and uh
[49:06] let me see I think here's a good picture
[49:08] so this is the okay no like now it's a
[49:12] website this here is shim Brun the
[49:15] palace and I actually live from here
[49:19] like if you run like 15 20 minutes away
[49:21] from here and I usually run in here and
[49:24] run to the side and then uh run in here
[49:27] and run up there and then down again so
[49:30] like that's usually my my my roote for
[49:33] people live in VI can now see I run here
[49:36] right at the center there where the the
[49:39] small hill starts there's a fountain and
[49:43] and when you show up the fountain I was
[49:44] like that that that seems to be a very
[49:46] familiar Fountain and that's actually
[49:48] this Fountain here uh maybe there is
[49:50] there some closeup picture like I think
[49:53] here this is it yeah uh and this is
[49:56] right that fountain that is I I live
[49:58] from that Fountain uh with with foot
[50:02] like maybe 30 minutes away and with the
[50:04] car like like 10 minutes away or
[50:05] something like that uh so yeah that's
[50:08] very close so if you ever in in in in
[50:11] Vienna let me know uh you have a guest
[50:13] room here in Vienna with me and I I'll
[50:17] I'll take you with my in in my running
[50:19] round there yeah and it's it's really
[50:22] nice there is a small restaurant over
[50:25] there and it's so lovely it's super
[50:28] expensive but it's so lovely to to sit
[50:30] there and and have something and yeah
[50:32] like uh there in Vienna honestly the
[50:36] more I the more I travel the more I love
[50:39] Austria and living in Vienna uh yes we
[50:43] have a lot of problems like taxes and
[50:46] bureaucracy and stuff like that but you
[50:48] can really see almost like that Austrian
[50:50] economics Bitcoin standard in the city
[50:53] uh if you if you see those amazing
[50:55] buildings those
[50:57] uh amazing um places where you can only
[51:00] walk and it's it's so impressive to see
[51:03] all those huge buildings and those old
[51:06] uh buildings that are really nicely
[51:08] intact or even renovated yeah it's it's
[51:12] a beautiful beautiful ra of it's so
[51:15] funny that is exactly Vienna Shimon that
[51:19] it's very close to to my home uh so I
[51:22] was like yeah like that that's like
[51:25] that's a almost too good to be true that
[51:28] you used that one yeah that I I love
[51:30] that here so I also took one or two
[51:32] podcast guests already here uh that came
[51:35] to my home and then I took them there
[51:37] and it's like oh like because the the
[51:39] street before that doesn't look that
[51:41] good and then they come to that street
[51:44] and then you're like oh that's quite
[51:45] good and then you uh then you don't see
[51:47] when you walk here that there's a whole
[51:49] new thing under here and that Garden is
[51:52] huge and it looks small now but that's
[51:55] that's so long and so huge and it like
[51:57] looks so Monumental uh when you're there
[52:00] uh just for references this is smaller
[52:03] this part than this part uh there like
[52:06] this is so much longer and it looks uh
[52:09] gigantic H so sorry for nering out on on
[52:12] on on Vienna and how beautiful it is
[52:15] here that's exact point I'm trying to
[52:19] make and that's just you know fantastic
[52:20] the things that you strikes me about
[52:22] this like yes you know this is so
[52:24] beautiful like this inspires you know
[52:25] greater optimism and you know we I I
[52:29] don't know it's like kind of romantic
[52:31] but it's like okay you there's no like
[52:35] nothing like humans can't achieve right
[52:37] like we've shown we can do like these
[52:38] beautiful awesome things and then it's
[52:40] just kind of like we stopped you know
[52:43] because I think we got you know
[52:44] discouraged because of like this you
[52:46] know symptom like these symptoms of yeah
[52:50] mindset and so when you're able to
[52:51] actually spend time with people in like
[52:53] these beautiful places like it gives you
[52:56] sense of hope and you know I think
[52:58] Bitcoin is going to you know enable that
[53:00] more and you specifically on this idea
[53:03] of Bitcoin third places which I've been
[53:05] really involved with and kind of
[53:06] obsessed with you as a see that
[53:08] beautiful palace with the beautiful
[53:09] square like we used to have places like
[53:13] that you know all over the the world you
[53:16] speciically like the Western World you
[53:17] know because we would want to facilitate
[53:19] people coming together and unfortunately
[53:21] I think this is more of a US problem
[53:23] where it's like we've just straight up
[53:25] destroyed them you maybe not as used as
[53:28] much in you know Europe or you know it's
[53:29] like the the trust and the high trust
[53:31] Society it's like been slowly degrading
[53:32] so it's not actually as pable to spend
[53:34] time you together with people but uh
[53:37] specifically what I'm doing with at the
[53:39] the space Denver dospace is the the
[53:42] website we formed our own Bitcoin
[53:45] Citadel so this is the third Bitcoin
[53:48] Citadel in the United States America
[53:51] behind Bitcoin Park and Bitcoin Commons
[53:54] there's a handful of like really
[53:56] wellestablished
[53:58] like incubators I'm thinking like ple
[54:00] lab or um some really good meetups y
[54:04] that's that's the the website like U you
[54:06] know Bitcoin Bay and they've all been
[54:08] you know extremely instrumental in
[54:11] helping us you know get to this point as
[54:13] bitcoiners are extremely generous but
[54:15] you know the whole idea of the space is
[54:17] like we're bringing back Community like
[54:19] we're bringing back third Places third
[54:22] spaces and Bitcoin is facilitating that
[54:25] and so the space is a combination of
[54:28] Social Club meets co-working meets
[54:31] events space and so we have a lot of
[54:34] events open to the public are we're
[54:36] educational nonprofit and the whole
[54:38] point of this is to you know educate and
[54:40] bring more people into the Bitcoin
[54:43] ecosystem and then inherently when you
[54:46] do that you attract people and you rally
[54:49] them around a common cause like you
[54:51] actually create a community right and so
[54:54] we have like a community of people that
[54:57] are extremely talented and want to be
[55:00] around each other it's like people from
[55:02] the space have helped me set up you my
[55:04] Bitcoin not they've helped me become
[55:06] more Sovereign they've helped me learn
[55:07] more about open- Source software about
[55:10] mining you know it's like people chip in
[55:13] to help clean we cook meals together we
[55:15] spend time together it's like in doing
[55:17] so it's like Bitcoin is facilitating us
[55:20] like from a Grassroots effort like
[55:22] Bitcoin is Bitcoin is a Grassroots
[55:24] effort it's one of like the most
[55:25] important aspects of Bitcoin so we're
[55:27] just applying those characteristics in
[55:30] our in real life and you know it's like
[55:33] it's amazing like the fruits that can be
[55:35] you know born from that you know it's
[55:37] like bringing back the place people can
[55:39] come and congregate and just be with
[55:41] other people specifically around a
[55:45] centralized you call and rallying flag
[55:47] like
[55:48] Bitcoin I love that yeah it's also um uh
[55:53] you you said then where you are from
[55:54] right correct and that's where I
[55:56] currently live from
[55:58] Wisconsin Midwest yeah how satisfied are
[56:01] you with with the Denver structure in
[56:03] the in the
[56:04] city oh sorry what was that how how
[56:07] satisfied are you with the Denver City
[56:10] Planning and structural design of
[56:13] Denver you know on a scale one to 10 I'd
[56:16] probably score it like a five my wife
[56:18] and I were one car household so I really
[56:20] try to drive as little as possible I try
[56:23] to take the train everywhere and I would
[56:26] a lot more if it ran on time like it
[56:30] it's actually extremely frustrating
[56:31] because I try to be like an advocate
[56:33] like hey let's take the train let's you
[56:35] go here and you know public
[56:37] transportation and then it just doesn't
[56:38] show up or it doesn't work and it's just
[56:40] like it drives me crazy and it's
[56:42] unfortunate because specifically for
[56:45] Western cities in the US public
[56:47] infrastructure tends to just be straight
[56:49] up bad because a lot of their growth was
[56:52] like post car so a lot of them were just
[56:55] built for car
[56:56] as opposed to some of the older cities
[56:58] out east where they were larger more
[57:00] established cities before the creation
[57:03] and proliferation of cars and so like
[57:06] New York kind of being like the most
[57:07] obvious example like they have the best
[57:09] public transit system in the US whereas
[57:13] I think Denver for a western City it's
[57:14] good it's not good by like European or
[57:17] Eastern American Standards but it it's
[57:20] trying they have great bike
[57:21] infrastructure which I do love and I do
[57:22] appreciate very you know outdoor you
[57:25] know community in city so it's like very
[57:27] active to a lot of young adults so
[57:29] that's kind of like inherent ethos which
[57:32] I do love obviously the mountains and
[57:33] the just in nature have a a great pull
[57:36] on that but you know it would just be
[57:39] much better and much easier if it was
[57:41] like rant confidently you know it's like
[57:44] that's another thing that kind of
[57:45] perplexes me in the US you know it's
[57:47] like all big cities you know in America
[57:50] are you know Democrat this isn't
[57:52] necessarily like a political statement
[57:53] even though I know it sounds like it but
[57:55] it's like a lot of them suffer from the
[57:57] same issues you know it's like lack of
[57:59] public transportation High Cost of
[58:01] Living homelessness you know whatever it
[58:04] may be and they just keep trying like
[58:06] the same philosophy over and over again
[58:08] and there's like literally no
[58:09] willingness to try anything different
[58:11] and so that that's very frustrating it's
[58:13] why I have to as much as I do love
[58:15] living here and there's like great
[58:16] aspects you know of it like specifically
[58:19] kind of like the transportation design I
[58:22] kind of lean around that five or six not
[58:24] that they inherently did anything
[58:26] wrong from like the foundation of it all
[58:29] it's just that it's ran so poorly it's
[58:32] like what are we
[58:33] doing interesting yeah it's it's gives
[58:37] gives a lot to think of like City design
[58:39] and and stuff like that didn't they
[58:42] didn't thought that we talk about that
[58:44] too so long but I think it's it's super
[58:47] interesting to think about how Bitcoin
[58:50] can or will influence our lives and and
[58:52] I hope we come to the world where it's
[58:54] more uh connected as you said and it's
[58:58] maybe more of the European living style
[59:00] and and less about that that car driving
[59:03] style I mean cars could be still
[59:05] relevant and important in the future I
[59:07] don't know how we we transport in the
[59:09] future but even if like even if we go to
[59:12] a future where cars are self-driving
[59:15] then we don't need we probably need like
[59:17] 10% of the parking space because the
[59:19] cars are not all the time sitting like
[59:21] if you own a car most likely it will sit
[59:24] around for like 90% % of the time or
[59:27] like 98% of the time uh and then it's
[59:31] like yeah like how much do you really
[59:33] use it how how useful is that car
[59:36] actually and and and I like to I like to
[59:40] own things that I use a lot uh obviously
[59:43] there are things that I barely used for
[59:45] example my
[59:46] shower maybe a weird thing to say but I
[59:49] I swim four times a week so I shower and
[59:53] do my hair like uh use my my my my clean
[59:58] my hair and shampoo my hair always in in
[60:00] in in the swimming pool and their
[60:02] showers so I the home show I never used
[60:05] but it's hard to get rid of it and and
[60:07] uh monetize on
[60:09] it but yeah like you should you should
[60:11] own things that that kind of make sense
[60:14] and uh you you you you can maybe
[60:17] monetize things that uh you don't use
[60:20] and the car is one of the things where
[60:21] I'm like yeah like there sometimes two
[60:23] three cars in standing in front of a
[60:25] house all the time like do you really
[60:28] need that many cars like maybe you can
[60:29] get it with one and then if you have
[60:32] because it's always the edge cases maybe
[60:34] there's like one point where everyone in
[60:35] the house needs needs a car if we then
[60:38] have come to the point where it's like
[60:39] self-driving and you just like get it is
[60:42] like and now a car to drive me there and
[60:44] it's comes in like two minutes it's like
[60:46] it's like a CH a cheap Uber basically
[60:48] and I think um yeah just going on off on
[60:51] the Tang but I think future will be
[60:54] Pride exactly
[60:56] exactly and that's why it's like I
[60:59] always like remind myself try to remind
[61:01] myself every day you know it's easy to
[61:03] get down it's easy to be like pessimist
[61:05] but you know it's like it's much harder
[61:06] but much more fun being an optimist you
[61:09] kind of classify myself as like a
[61:11] technical Optimist and yeah that's
[61:13] really kind of like my call to action to
[61:15] bitcoiners it's like a lot of these
[61:17] problems do seem very big and very big
[61:19] problems are kind of like sometimes
[61:20] doting but it's like we are the ones
[61:23] that believe in individual agencies so
[61:26] it's like literally like proverbial pick
[61:28] yourself up by your bootstraps like we
[61:30] can do this we have a sound monetary
[61:32] system it's a savings technology you
[61:35] know I a firm believer you know
[61:37] bitcoiners will be the 1% of Economic
[61:39] and political power in the future so we
[61:41] have to build the world we want to live
[61:43] in and you know this is a process it's
[61:45] it's baby steps that's why you know I
[61:48] frequently reflect on bology work and
[61:51] you know like Network States I'm a
[61:52] network State Enthusiast and I believe
[61:55] he was on a podcast episode Upstream
[61:58] with um I can't remember Eric something
[62:01] I can't remember the the host name so
[62:03] he's just like in that episode he's
[62:05] talking about it's like how do you take
[62:06] back San Francisco you know I commonly
[62:08] refer to San Francisco as like Gotham
[62:11] City was like The Shining City on the
[62:13] hill and it's like it imploded on itself
[62:15] from like bad management you know they
[62:17] like had everything they could ask for
[62:20] and they you ruined it so it's like how
[62:22] do you his you know you was plaining how
[62:24] you take back San Francisco just like
[62:26] block by block you it's like you have to
[62:28] get people together that align with your
[62:31] moral worldview and plant your flag so
[62:33] it's like that's why I think what we've
[62:35] done with the space is you know we got a
[62:37] physical building a physical you know
[62:40] Gathering Spot we have a community we've
[62:42] planted our orange flag in the ground
[62:44] you know this has been like a
[62:45] peer-to-peer movement you know we don't
[62:48] the space isn't like corporately owned
[62:50] or run this is a member run and operated
[62:53] organization and we are trying to
[62:56] Outsource as much as possible um on like
[62:58] a resources tab in there you know we we
[63:00] want to make you know the next Citadel
[63:03] that much easier to start there's
[63:05] already one starting in San Francisco in
[63:07] the US we've talked about Bitcoin Works
[63:09] in Edinburgh there's proof for work that
[63:12] space in lagano there's another one in
[63:14] Italy so it's like the more bitcoiners
[63:16] are willing to interact with each other
[63:19] and this is actually something you know
[63:20] I think interesting or maybe like a
[63:22] weakness of bitcoiners which I think
[63:24] stems from like
[63:26] libertarianism where it's like the left
[63:28] and kind of just like broadly like
[63:30] socialist to be like really good at
[63:32] organizing I think you like you see this
[63:33] a lot in like crypto and like all the
[63:36] altcoins like it's very easy for them to
[63:38] organize and like get a project spun up
[63:40] like very quickly where it's like
[63:41] bitcoiners are a little bit
[63:43] more like I said libertarian you know
[63:46] like don't tread on me and whatnot a
[63:49] little more individualistic so it's like
[63:50] we kind of need to move past that and
[63:53] like organize you know together and and
[63:55] plant the you know it's like there's you
[63:56] know many examples now we're trying to
[63:58] make it easier for anybody to take
[64:00] action on this but you do it in baby
[64:02] steps and so it's like you just have to
[64:03] take action and get off the ground
[64:05] because if we don't do that what are we
[64:07] going to do with that political 1% of
[64:10] Economic and or that 1% of political and
[64:12] economic power absolutely and it's it it
[64:16] brings up so many topics but one thing
[64:20] I'm I'm curious uh around uh I mean I
[64:24] think maybe we should do a second round
[64:25] like like there are so many more uh
[64:27] things I want to get into with you and I
[64:29] thought about like oh if like open that
[64:31] we we're going probably for like a two
[64:32] three hour
[64:35] episode but maybe we can close it
[64:38] actually and it would be interesting uh
[64:40] for you with with with tradire because
[64:42] you wrote it also in the text that you
[64:44] all want to talk about traditional
[64:46] finance and and how you see it entering
[64:49] uh that I think that would be a great
[64:51] ending point to the to the podcast um
[64:53] how do you see it dreadfire entering to
[64:55] the Bitcoin space with the ETFs maybe
[64:58] like with the institutionalizing of
[65:01] Bitcoin mining more and more uh with now
[65:04] nation states uh also entering the game
[65:07] with micro strategy and meta planet and
[65:10] so many uh traditional Finance players
[65:13] that are now into Bitcoin totally no
[65:15] thank you for the the question I like I
[65:18] you mentioned earlier it's like my
[65:20] background degrees in like Finance
[65:22] traditional Finance I always joke now
[65:23] it's like a lot of good that did me you
[65:25] know I had to unlearn all the stuff and
[65:27] you relearn Bitcoin but I really just
[65:29] identify more as a entrepreneur and I
[65:31] founded basilic wealth management where
[65:33] Bitcoin wealth management firm and so
[65:37] you this is something like I work a lot
[65:40] with obviously my day job but do a lot
[65:41] of thinking and and research on and you
[65:44] know kind of just like a fun statistic
[65:46] is there's about like 300,000 financial
[65:49] advisors in the United States I'm part
[65:51] of the Bitcoin financial advisors
[65:53] Network and there's nine of us you know
[65:56] so it's like a very almost a niche of a
[65:58] niche you know uh propagating like the
[66:01] the Bitcoin message and you know in the
[66:04] US this is a highly regulated you know
[66:06] industry so it's like I'm a fiary which
[66:08] means I have to act you know always act
[66:10] in the best interest of my clients and I
[66:12] believe it's my fiduciary duty to talk
[66:15] about Bitcoin you know it's the best
[66:17] performing asset over the last 10 years
[66:20] kind of where you know we differ as a
[66:21] firm as we focus on Sound cuty Solutions
[66:24] you know so this isn't just exposure
[66:26] price exposure via the ETF this is you
[66:29] know how do we self- custody the bare
[66:31] asset itself and become sovereign
[66:33] individuals U so that's what you know I
[66:35] focus a lot of my my time on you know
[66:38] dayto day but if you just move it up one
[66:41] level from that and again you know of
[66:42] course not Financial advice but in
[66:45] acting as a duty my duty as a fiduciary
[66:49] you know a lot of times that comes down
[66:50] to understanding each client's
[66:52] individual financial needs right because
[66:55] everybody you know
[66:57] different so there's the financial
[67:00] planning aspect of that there's like
[67:01] portfolio management aspect of that
[67:03] there's this
[67:05] psychological aspect to that and I think
[67:09] up until recently even if you wanted to
[67:12] be you know you were like a Bitcoin
[67:14] wealth manager you wanted to you know
[67:16] fulfill your fiduciary duty to your
[67:18] clients it was it was actually very
[67:20] challenging because there's a lot of
[67:22] controls and regulations like around
[67:25] Bitcoin in the United States and so
[67:28] fortunately and one of the things that
[67:30] you know is not only happening currently
[67:32] in the market but I've kind of expanded
[67:35] on in some of my other writings is like
[67:37] the Bitcoin financial service industry
[67:39] is really growing in in some fantastic
[67:42] ways and I'm a Bitcoin only firm I only
[67:45] work with Bitcoin Partners that's you
[67:46] know companies like River unchain and
[67:50] you know what these companies are doing
[67:52] is building out the capabilities for
[67:54] people like me to service our clients
[67:57] and I'll just kind of give an example
[67:59] build Asset Management as a US asset
[68:01] manager they're built um they're out of
[68:04] Seattle and they've created a private
[68:06] credit fund where they buy Bitcoin
[68:09] collateralized loans in a private credit
[68:12] fund and then they sell that so they're
[68:14] kind of
[68:15] securitizing which a lot of times is
[68:17] like a bad word in Bitcoin but that's a
[68:20] tried and true traditional Finance
[68:23] product and strategy that's been applied
[68:25] to Bitcoin so unchain originates alone
[68:30] so they give dollars to a customer that
[68:33] customer uses their Bitcoin as
[68:36] collateral build buys that loan packages
[68:40] up in a private credit fund and then my
[68:43] clients can buy that private credit fund
[68:46] and then get the yield from the interest
[68:48] paid on the Bitcoin loan so this is how
[68:51] we could fulfill like the fixed income
[68:54] exposure that a particular client may
[68:56] need maybe they're older in retirement
[68:58] they need consistent income but build
[69:00] has built a financial product using you
[69:03] know like I said traditional Financial
[69:05] tools and applied it to bitcoin so that
[69:07] client is now getting their fixed income
[69:10] requirement with exposure to bitcoin and
[69:12] so there's just more and more stuff like
[69:15] this coming out which makes me extremely
[69:17] excited most recently strive Asset
[69:19] Management they've announced an ETF
[69:21] where they're buying the micro strategy
[69:23] of the world the metap planets you know
[69:25] companies that have issued debt to buy
[69:27] Bitcoin putting that into um mutual fund
[69:31] or ETF I can't remember what
[69:32] specifically they're doing with that and
[69:35] now that's like a publicly traded
[69:37] security that I can advise on or clients
[69:40] can you know buy and we are
[69:42] fulfilling some of those traditional
[69:44] Finance needs in the Bitcoin ethos and
[69:47] so you again I still think this is you
[69:50] know emerging there's a lot of work to
[69:52] be done but this is how it kind of you
[69:55] know evaluates you know opportunities
[69:57] like this I mean there's a lot of these
[70:01] I think Shenanigans in defi I really try
[70:05] not to use that word I don't like it
[70:07] because it's like association with
[70:09] crypto or shitcoins at large right and
[70:13] you know it's kind of like specifically
[70:14] around that yield point where it's like
[70:16] if you don't know where the yield is
[70:17] coming from like you are the yield well
[70:20] that is like defi degenerate
[70:23] debaucherous crypto games what I just
[70:26] describe with build like that is like
[70:28] Bitcoin games you know that's like tried
[70:31] and true you just applied a try strategy
[70:35] you know to bitcoin and so I always look
[70:38] at it's like you know is this multisig
[70:41] you know building on chains like they
[70:43] you go to their websites with more
[70:44] information but it's like this is all
[70:47] multisig infrastructure there's no
[70:49] rehypothecation proof of reserves you
[70:52] can verify that your collateral you know
[70:54] hasn't been move there's no ability for
[70:57] that collateral to be moved without you
[70:59] know the proper uh majority of keys and
[71:03] so while it's exciting that a lot of
[71:06] these traditional Financial strategies
[71:08] are being applied and brought to bitcoin
[71:11] I like to be little provocative with
[71:13] this I think this is like the
[71:14] financialization of Bitcoin just like
[71:16] poke bitcoiners in the rib a little bit
[71:19] um these are ultimately good things
[71:22] now kind of again you pulling my like
[71:25] libertarian beliefs I don't think this
[71:27] is should necessarily be regulated I
[71:30] actually like to some extent obviously
[71:32] like there's a lot of Regulation
[71:34] financial markets depending on what type
[71:36] of products or strategies you're talking
[71:38] about that can vary what I'm like
[71:41] specifically talking about at a high
[71:43] level here is like I would rather be the
[71:47] responsibility of Bitcoin companies to
[71:50] prove to me they hold true within
[71:53] themselves the Bitcoin ethos were there
[71:55] just going to set this product or
[71:56] strategy up with multisig from the
[71:58] beginning because they know that's the
[72:00] right thing to do because that's like
[72:01] the Bitcoin way right so it's like how
[72:03] are we holding some of these you know
[72:06] existing companies or inspiring you know
[72:08] the companies of tomorrow to just do
[72:10] things like the right way from the
[72:12] beginning yeah and and I think it's so
[72:14] funny with defi because you mentioned
[72:16] that it's like Bitcoin is the only
[72:21] defi like defi is decentralized finance
[72:24] and there like Bitcoin is the only one
[72:27] that can call itself defi like the other
[72:31] defi is just CI that calls itself defi
[72:35] it's really
[72:36] frustrating oh it's so true it's so true
[72:39] that's like literally one of like my
[72:41] main talking points you about that as
[72:44] well and you know just some I think kind
[72:47] of like the the bigger Trends to you I
[72:49] see in like this you know
[72:51] financialization of Bitcoin where you
[72:54] know bringing you not all of trafi is
[72:58] inherently you know bad or what I was
[73:00] classifying it was before is like evil
[73:02] like there's nothing wrong with like an
[73:04] option contract inherently or derivative
[73:07] right that is just like two Market
[73:09] participants taking you know one side of
[73:11] the BET like one will be wrong one will
[73:13] be right there's nothing wrong with that
[73:15] so it's like I don't think there's
[73:16] anything wrong with applying these TR
[73:18] five products and strategies to bitcoin
[73:21] we just want to take the best of try and
[73:23] not the worst of try and we need to be
[73:25] cognizant of that but as like these you
[73:29] know ecosystems products and strategies
[73:31] like keep develop like I think this is
[73:34] going to actually increase
[73:36] diversification this is something like
[73:38] funny with bitcoiners uh because I while
[73:41] I do think it's like your pristine asset
[73:44] like black hole like again like I'm as
[73:47] bullish as anybody on bitcoin how I'm
[73:50] thinking about this through my fiduciary
[73:52] lens like my responsibilities to clients
[73:55] is like what I mentioned you know
[73:57] earlier it's like well how are we
[73:58] getting like Bitcoin exposure through
[74:00] different you know products and
[74:01] strategies like okay I'm satisfy my
[74:03] fixed income requirements through a
[74:05] Bitcoin strategy and a trafy strategy I
[74:08] think you know as the derivatives and
[74:10] hedging markets you know get built out
[74:12] this is really just you know risk
[74:14] management I don't think there's
[74:15] anything inherently wrong with like a
[74:17] corporate professional Finance team
[74:19] applied to a Bitcoin standard right I'm
[74:24] really bullish on like uh loans and
[74:26] collateral I think coinbase just
[74:28] announced today they're offering Loans
[74:31] To Us customers and again like I think
[74:33] this an exciting development but we got
[74:36] to hold them to like our Bitcoin
[74:38] principles and Ethos you Multistate cold
[74:40] storage now re hypoth I haven't seen the
[74:42] exact details on how they're doing that
[74:44] but this is just an example of
[74:47] more uh opportunities or you know more
[74:50] options coming to to Market and as
[74:53] specifically like loan Market
[74:55] get built out me it's like I don't want
[74:57] to sell my Bitcoin either like how can
[74:59] we use that as collateral I don't think
[75:01] there's anything inherently wrong with
[75:03] lending or loans you know it's just
[75:06] where a lot of the shenanigans and trafi
[75:09] have come from it's like if you have
[75:11] free money you know this is like the Zer
[75:13] zero interest rate you know phenomena
[75:15] you just like again like we were talking
[75:17] about earlier like you skewed you've
[75:19] murky these markets because there's no
[75:21] cost of money well there will inherently
[75:22] be a cost of money in Bitcoin like I
[75:24] don't think there's way around that so
[75:26] when you have institutions you know
[75:29] using unchain example here they you know
[75:32] underwrite alone what they're really
[75:35] doing there is like they're kind of
[75:37] assigning like a market signal on the
[75:40] perceived risk of Bitcoin volatility
[75:43] with their interest rate as more Market
[75:45] participants enter like they will be you
[75:47] know competed down to the markets
[75:52] perceived a risk of Bitcoin volatility
[75:55] so if you have a lot of
[75:57] Institutions that
[75:58] issue you know loans using Bitcoin as
[76:02] collateral that interest rate will serve
[76:04] to the rest of the market market
[76:06] participants like a perceived risk of
[76:08] Bitcoin volatility so I just think
[76:10] that's like particularly an interesting
[76:13] Dynamic that's evolving in the Bitcoin
[76:15] ecosystem because like what we're really
[76:17] doing here is we're deepening the
[76:20] Bitcoin Capital markets and we're
[76:22] allowing more Market participants to
[76:24] enter it dependent on their own
[76:27] individual needs like a multinational
[76:29] corporation you know let's take an
[76:30] airline for example they might need to
[76:33] hedge like the price of fuel in the
[76:36] future so if they're using a Bitcoin
[76:38] standard they would need those classic
[76:40] risk management tools and products
[76:43] available to them and the res of the
[76:45] market can see that as another data
[76:47] point to make economic debad driven
[76:50] economic decisions for themselves and so
[76:53] ultimately I think as the Bitcoin
[76:55] Capital markets deepen we have improved
[76:57] price stability which will just kind of
[77:00] be like the natural maturation of
[77:03] Bitcoin that uh and it's it really I
[77:06] think it's an amazing episode already um
[77:11] really really nice we have one question
[77:14] that asked each and every one of my
[77:15] guests as you might know and the
[77:17] question is what can we learn from you
[77:19] besides Bitcoin we talked already some
[77:21] some things besides Bitcoin but is is
[77:23] there something else also that you will
[77:25] like to
[77:25] that yeah well I
[77:28] really you I I think this is kind of
[77:31] like a a good like symptom of of Bitcoin
[77:35] one thing I really try to be cognizant
[77:36] of my myself and I try to like instill
[77:40] uh you know in my clients is like as
[77:43] bitcoiners like I mentioned like I
[77:45] believe we're going to be like the
[77:46] political one% of econ or excuse me the
[77:50] 1% of Economic and political power so do
[77:56] you have like a moral world viw have you
[77:58] adopted a moral worldview that will
[78:02] incentivize you to be a good Steward of
[78:04] your wealth and the resources you have
[78:08] amassed right and so I like to really
[78:11] dig into like this like social level of
[78:14] of Bitcoin I really you know encourage
[78:16] everybody to you know adopt a more
[78:18] worldview like that because you
[78:20] ultimately will be responsible for
[78:22] building the world we want to see and
[78:25] you know if we're good stewards of our
[78:27] wealth and you know our resources that
[78:30] will be you know much more you know
[78:32] feasible I think you know ultimately not
[78:35] only in the interest of bitcoiners but
[78:37] Society at large absolutely I love that
[78:41] really cool perfect then uh we come to
[78:44] our end routine and I think it's a
[78:46] really good point because uh sorry Sor
[78:48] to interrupt you again but I think the
[78:51] the thing of um we
[78:55] bitcoiners uh maybe some actually
[78:59] stumbled upon them because some friend
[79:01] forc them into it or like some were like
[79:04] oh okay let's try this Bitcoin thing
[79:06] without really understanding the eepas
[79:08] and then all of the sudden they got a
[79:09] lot of wealth but I think most of the
[79:11] bitcoiners actually um got into Bitcoin
[79:14] because they researched they understood
[79:16] it they adopted the EOS they adopted the
[79:18] mindset so a lot of Bitcoins I think
[79:20] will be very great with resource
[79:23] allocations and with like like uh uh
[79:26] good going good around that resources
[79:29] and going good around that wealth and
[79:32] those who don't anyways will lose it
[79:34] quick
[79:35] so that doesn't really matter like the
[79:37] free market kind of sorts out but we do
[79:40] have an interesting responsibility to to
[79:43] form uh the the new world and and I like
[79:46] that idea I think Alex Alex swety also
[79:49] talks about that idea a lot in in his
[79:51] new book I completely blank on the on
[79:54] the name of
[79:56] what the Bushido of Bitcoin yes the
[79:59] Bushido of Bitcoin I think that that's
[80:00] also kind of the where where where this
[80:03] is going yeah but yeah thank you so much
[80:05] uh we have an end rtin in the podcast
[80:07] where the previous guest is asking a
[80:08] question for the next guest without
[80:10] knowing who the next guest actually is
[80:12] and the previous guest uh asked you the
[80:14] question what's the role of
[80:16] decentralization in Bitcoin and how far
[80:19] can decentralization go oh that's fun
[80:21] that's a that's a a great question you
[80:25] actually kind of I think touched on it
[80:26] beautifully before I think what's
[80:30] imperative for bitcoiners to know and
[80:36] kind of like evangelize with you know
[80:39] like this is a tool in our tool belt
[80:41] it's like we are actually the only
[80:42] decentralized protocol and that's like
[80:44] very important and it's a shame that
[80:47] like the marketing Departments of all
[80:49] these crypto projects have like just
[80:51] really kind of like I think belittled
[80:53] that word like it's it's really kind of
[80:55] like a buzzword I think or reduced to
[80:57] like a buzzword most times but that's
[80:59] actually like the most important thing
[81:01] or like certainly one of the most
[81:03] important things because like the whole
[81:04] point of like a
[81:06] free market and a sound money is that
[81:10] there's no Central controller as far as
[81:12] I know Bitcoin is the only protocol that
[81:16] supports it and this just is all credit
[81:19] to you know Satoshi because he is just
[81:22] like I love like the design of Bitcoin I
[81:24] think it's like so beautiful and well
[81:26] thought out where it's like the asset
[81:28] incentivizes the network but the network
[81:31] protects the asset and that can only be
[81:33] done in a decentralized open- source
[81:36] protocol
[81:38] where Market participants have a vested
[81:42] interest without any particular loyalty
[81:45] or allegiance to a nation state or any
[81:49] sort of you know other type of group
[81:50] they might identify with absolutely yeah
[81:54] um I love that answer also really cool
