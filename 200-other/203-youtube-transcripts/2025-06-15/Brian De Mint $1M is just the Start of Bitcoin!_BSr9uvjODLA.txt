[00:00] bitcoin's going to go to $1 million
[00:01] someday or even if it's 10 million it's
[00:03] just going to get to some big number and
[00:04] then it's just going to tap out that is
[00:06] not how Economics work every day is
[00:08] election day when my supplier the people
[00:11] that sell soap and toilet paper and
[00:13] paper towels and all that kind of stuff
[00:14] as soon as they start to accept Bitcoin
[00:17] now my business can get paid in Bitcoin
[00:19] and not have to get out of Bitcoin
[00:21] that's when we will see this absolute
[00:23] hockey stick there's nothing more
[00:24] powerful than an idea whose time has
[00:26] come and I firmly believe that bitcoin's
[00:28] time has come everything in the world
[00:30] world will be priced in Bitcoin people
[00:31] who accept Bitcoin are far more likely
[00:34] to then go and spend Bitcoin Bitcoin
[00:37] represents the first time in human
[00:39] history where the parallel economy is
[00:42] not being built in response to the
[00:44] collapse of Empire it has a head start
[00:46] it has been built before the collapse of
[00:48] Empire Bitcoin economy may be the
[00:51] economy of the world if we start to
[00:53] worship Bitcoin as God and we've lost
[00:55] track of of what money does cbdcs would
[00:57] be the blight of humanity they would be
[01:00] the most tyrannical tool in human
[01:01] history if Bitcoin didn't already exist
[01:04] Bitcoin is a giant middle finger it's a
[01:06] giant no to
[01:09] [Music]
[01:12] cbdc hi Brian how you doing everything
[01:14] fine on your end things are good over
[01:16] here it's actually Labor Day here in the
[01:18] United States and so it's uh I'd
[01:20] scheduled a bunch of stuff you and I had
[01:22] scheduled months out for this and I I
[01:24] just did that with my schedule so my my
[01:26] schedule's booked today but it's nice
[01:28] cuz I'm in the office and nobody's here
[01:29] so it's peace and quiet and it's
[01:31] actually a good environment to to work
[01:33] in so we call it Labor day but it's
[01:35] actually a pretty good day to put put in
[01:37] some
[01:37] labor interesting I I actually I had
[01:41] three podcasts today I just got to know
[01:44] about it now like I'm sorry for my
[01:45] American friends that unfortunately H
[01:48] got a podcast in labor day it's not a
[01:51] real holiday it's like one of those ones
[01:53] where you know people get it off because
[01:55] it's a it's a it's a Federal holiday
[01:56] it's a national holiday but I mean it's
[01:59] good I guess it's good for the for the
[02:01] for the employees and stuff every once
[02:03] in a while to get a day off and you know
[02:05] just go recharge the batteries but you
[02:07] know three-day weekend didn't never hurt
[02:08] hurt anybody but for me to me yeah it's
[02:11] it's a good day to get stuff in and I
[02:13] think it's the perfect start to talk
[02:15] about parallel economy and price
[02:17] controls because like it's a a
[02:18] government holiday so kind of
[02:21] governments addicted when people uh
[02:24] having holidays which is an very
[02:26] interesting concept especially in
[02:28] Austria I think there's not one nation
[02:30] that has as many public holidays as
[02:33] Austria I think there's not one H one
[02:35] nation that has more than that didn't do
[02:37] a research but I think we have a lot um
[02:40] uh how does price like maybe uh before
[02:43] we get actually to price controls and
[02:45] parallel economies do you see uh also
[02:47] like actually like a a a comp um the
[02:51] government trying to get uh when you
[02:54] have holidays also some sort of of price
[02:57] control not price control but
[02:58] controlling the free market
[03:00] well yeah it is I mean it it it just
[03:02] clearly is like why why is that the
[03:05] position of the government to say when
[03:06] people can and cannot work now that's
[03:09] generally viewed as positive but but
[03:12] stimulus checks during covid were
[03:13] generally viewed as positive you know
[03:15] just just because people generally like
[03:17] something doesn't mean that it's not
[03:19] centrally planned Fiat government um
[03:21] unfortunately that's much that's that's
[03:23] much more akin to to socialism um than
[03:27] it is to a free market it just clearly
[03:29] is not free market Basics when the
[03:32] government is telling you days that
[03:34] should be working and then days where
[03:36] you should not be working um for example
[03:38] in my company we are a big believer in
[03:40] taking time off and having time to to
[03:42] rest and recover um we we are closed in
[03:45] a in my Wellness Studios we're closed
[03:48] every Sunday we we're not open on
[03:50] Sundays um part of for me part of that
[03:53] comes out of a of a religious conviction
[03:55] of of having a day of rest but for my
[03:57] employees that aren't religious it's
[04:00] it's a just a much needed day off and so
[04:02] we know and my my employees if you work
[04:04] for me you can count on the fact that
[04:06] you're not going to get calls you're not
[04:08] going to get texts or emails or any of
[04:09] that kind of stuff on on Sundays now
[04:12] sometimes I will work on Sundays and I
[04:14] make sure that that if I'm if I'm
[04:15] sending my store managers emails or
[04:18] anything like that I schedule it so that
[04:19] it doesn't go out and doesn't hit their
[04:21] inbox until Monday morning because I
[04:23] don't want them to have to be dealing
[04:24] with stuff that that I as the
[04:26] entrepreneur I have the burden of always
[04:28] being on the clock always always always
[04:30] ready to take a call or something like
[04:31] that but if you're an employee of a job
[04:34] then I think that's one of the benefits
[04:36] of the free market is as an employer I
[04:38] can make my B place of business more
[04:40] appealing by structuring our schedule
[04:43] structuring our our compensation all of
[04:46] that's part of the free market if I want
[04:48] to outdo my competitors then it's not
[04:50] just my prices and it's not just the
[04:52] level of service we have it's also the
[04:54] type of people we attract and so if I
[04:56] can attract better people because I
[04:57] offer better in incentives for working
[05:00] for me that is the free market at work
[05:03] that's how you that's how you
[05:04] incentivize competition amongst
[05:05] businesses now when the government steps
[05:07] in they say this this is the day you
[05:09] work these are the days you don't work
[05:11] it's not we we it's not uh it's not the
[05:14] end of the world and and it's not it
[05:16] sounds like we're splitting hairs here
[05:18] but it just shows that government is
[05:19] creeping their way in and then I think
[05:22] the more Insidious part of it is that it
[05:24] it instills in the in the minds of
[05:26] people uh who don't consider these
[05:28] things it it instills this idea that
[05:32] government is supposed to be the one
[05:33] that dictates those things and and so
[05:36] that's the problem is that the average
[05:38] person thinks that oh well let me look
[05:41] to the government's lead on when I
[05:42] should be working let me look to the
[05:44] government's lead on what is the minimum
[05:46] amount amount of money I should be
[05:47] making per hour what is the what is the
[05:49] government's uh take on how much paid
[05:51] time off I should get when I'm when I'm
[05:53] sick right all of those things people
[05:56] act like if the government didn't do
[05:57] those things that that the free market
[05:59] Market wouldn't have an answer for those
[06:01] guess what paid time off same thing the
[06:04] government here in California says that
[06:06] we have to provide a certain amount of
[06:07] paid time off it's actually pretty
[06:10] generous what the what the state of
[06:11] California does it's not generous on
[06:12] their part because they're just using
[06:14] other people's money to do it but as a
[06:15] business owner we always try to exceed
[06:18] like if uh one of my employees just had
[06:20] a just had a baby she's a single mom we
[06:22] gave her more time off with more pay
[06:26] than what the state of California offers
[06:28] and we intentionally did that even
[06:29] though that's a sacrifice of our
[06:30] business because we want to outdo what
[06:33] the government does because we want to
[06:35] attract better and brighter people to
[06:37] our business um and we also want to
[06:39] reverse engineer this idea that the
[06:41] government's the one that gives this to
[06:42] you no your company the one who who's
[06:45] got your back because you you come in
[06:46] you work 40 hours a week you get our
[06:48] back we are going to get your back when
[06:49] you need it that's how you attract
[06:51] really good people the free market could
[06:53] do that if my if my competitor down the
[06:55] street is offering really good paid time
[06:57] off incentives well if I want to attract
[06:59] better people and beat him I need to
[07:02] offer better paytime off incentives so
[07:04] the free market would actually be more
[07:06] generous to employees than the
[07:08] government the government just sets a
[07:09] minimum threshold um and that that
[07:12] creates again this idea that people look
[07:15] to the government for their next what's
[07:17] my next step what is the next thing I
[07:19] should do with work if we look to the
[07:21] free market we'd have a lot better
[07:22] Solutions and it's so interesting do you
[07:25] have in America also supermarkets closed
[07:27] on Sundays
[07:29] uh supermarkets are not closed on
[07:31] Sundays so the supermarkets are are open
[07:34] yeah yeah the supermarkets actually if
[07:36] you if you're a supermarket employee you
[07:38] better be prepared to work because that
[07:40] is one thing where where uh those people
[07:43] those they're open early in the morning
[07:44] they're open late at night and they're
[07:46] open on holidays I mean they're open on
[07:47] Christmas they're open on New Year's
[07:49] they're open on whatever whatever
[07:50] holidays supermarkets are are kind of
[07:52] one of those exceptions it's the same
[07:54] thing with Co though you saw even with
[07:56] Co supermarkets were open I mean you got
[07:58] to have food I guess is is the
[08:00] government's take on it so uh yeah that
[08:02] is that is one of the exceptions but if
[08:03] it's a bank if you're a bank employee I
[08:06] mean you're you're getting off every
[08:08] random holiday that that you that you
[08:10] could possibly imagine and now again as
[08:12] a business owner to me that's
[08:13] frustrating because it's uh it's Monday
[08:16] morning here in the United States and
[08:18] this goes back to how awesome Bitcoin is
[08:20] all the payments I got last week in
[08:22] Bitcoin which we don't get a ton of
[08:24] payments in Bitcoin but we do accept
[08:25] Bitcoin payments in my businesses um I
[08:28] got them with in 4 seconds you know so
[08:31] if I sold something on Thursday morning
[08:33] we got that payment within 4 seconds
[08:34] because we we you we use lightning uh
[08:37] anything in Fiat where somebody swiped a
[08:39] credit card I still have not gotten paid
[08:42] for that here we are Monday morning I
[08:44] still haven't gotten paid for it I'm
[08:45] going to get paid for it tomorrow
[08:46] morning Tuesday morning for things that
[08:48] I sold on Thursday so we put out the
[08:51] time the expense the labor the utilities
[08:53] to air conditioning our building all
[08:55] those all those expenses accured for us
[08:57] but we still haven't gotten paid for all
[08:59] those things and we won't get paid until
[09:01] at least tomorrow because these bank
[09:03] holidays again the government says Banks
[09:05] get to close what does that mean for
[09:07] businesses means you're taking an extra
[09:08] 24 hours where's that money that money
[09:10] is somewhere somebody's making interest
[09:12] on that money it sure isn't me it's not
[09:15] the person who spent that money with me
[09:16] it's not the customer it's not me the
[09:18] the merchant these Banks they get to
[09:21] close down limiting their expenses and
[09:23] this is government government ordained
[09:24] the government said hey you get to close
[09:26] so so none of your employees have to
[09:28] work and you get to hold on to this
[09:30] money for another 24 hours well 24 hours
[09:33] holding on to this money doesn't sound
[09:35] like a lot but when you're talking
[09:36] about100 billion dollars of of money
[09:39] that's sloshing around just a a few
[09:42] basis points of interest for that day
[09:44] that you're going to earn it is a ton of
[09:46] money over a year over a year
[09:49] period it's a an amazing business model
[09:52] for the banks it is interesting also for
[09:55] me because I uh first only took payments
[09:57] in in Fiat because it was afraid of
[09:59] taxes and stuff like that for my podcast
[10:02] now two out of my free podcast uh
[10:04] sponsors actually pay me in Bitcoin and
[10:07] one uh we did actually yesterday it was
[10:09] a Sunday uh and we just uh set
[10:12] everything up it was really quick and we
[10:14] had it in like 10 minutes and it was on
[10:17] a Sunday and it was amazing and with
[10:19] with uh Fiat we would have not gotten it
[10:22] because also different continents like
[10:24] you need routing numbers and all that
[10:26]  and a lot of fees uh and it it was
[10:29] such such a such a pleasure doing that
[10:31] like it was such a nice experience I
[10:33] love it but I brought the Sunday
[10:35] Supermarket question up because here in
[10:36] Austria and I think that's a great
[10:38] example of government intervention here
[10:40] in Austria Sunday supermarkets are
[10:42] closed except those on uh train station
[10:47] or gas stations because they said like
[10:50] people that drive through Austria they
[10:52] have to have something for food but the
[10:54] people that live here apparently not wow
[10:56] so what happens is in a big city for
[10:59] example in Vienna uh I live close to
[11:01] train station and here you can go to the
[11:04] supermarket a very small uh train
[11:07] station supermarket and there's a line
[11:09] in front of it like like 15 people
[11:12] waiting to get into the supermarket uh
[11:15] just because the government doesn't want
[11:17] supermarkets to be open except in a
[11:19] train station where I'm like that's that
[11:22] shows when the government intervenes in
[11:24] the free market disres inefficiencies I
[11:27] always bring that example up because I
[11:29] think it's a great one to show uh the
[11:31] government intervention inefficiencies
[11:34] yeah can I can I ask why do this do they
[11:36] say why things are closed Sunday yeah
[11:39] it's a religious thing uh Christian
[11:42] Christian as a as a Christian I
[11:46] vehemently am opposed to the government
[11:48] mandating Sundays being closed we're
[11:50] closed Sundays I don't think the
[11:52] government should do that especially for
[11:54] for things like groceries like holy cow
[11:57] wow yeah it's uh and it's it's it's so
[12:00] irrational because for example
[12:02] restaurants are open of course so like
[12:04] why why is the restaurant waitress not
[12:07] getting off but the the supermark uh
[12:10] like it's it's it's so irrational and
[12:12] the the train station supermarkets are
[12:14] the same brand like the same company
[12:17] that have the normal Supermarket like it
[12:19] it has absolutely there no no reason but
[12:22] uh sorry for for bringing that outage I
[12:24] think that's a that's fascinating I'm
[12:26] I'm genuinely intrigued by that wow
[12:30] well and and soorry not to make this
[12:31] like a religious thing but that's like
[12:34] Jesus the these you know these these
[12:35] politicians are saying they're
[12:36] Christians well like Jesus repeatedly
[12:40] talks about the Sabbath like as one of
[12:42] the things that him and the Pharisees
[12:44] conflict conflicted over like he
[12:46] actually did work on Sundays because he
[12:48] said the heart of the message is well
[12:49] it's this time to to restore and recover
[12:52] and and you know have some prayer time
[12:54] and stuff like that but when there's
[12:55] meaningful work that needs to be done
[12:57] I'm going to go ahead and do it like
[12:59] that that's that's it's the antithesis
[13:02] so they're they're guilty of the
[13:05] legalism the very legalism in which
[13:07] Jesus came and spoke against and yet
[13:09] they're creating this legalism in terms
[13:12] of codifying it in terms of the
[13:13] government I mean it's it's the highest
[13:15] form of hypo of hypocrisy and it's based
[13:19] in misunderstanding which is quite
[13:22] frustrating yeah it's it's frustrating
[13:24] sometimes as an entrepreneur in
[13:26] Austria but uh back to the topic of of
[13:30] parallel economies I think that's a
[13:31] great Gateway um first of all you wrote
[13:33] a book on that so first question what is
[13:36] your main takeaway from from the book
[13:39] what what are you hoping that people get
[13:40] from it the main point of the book I can
[13:42] give you I'll give you the thesis of the
[13:43] book in a second but the the takeaway I
[13:46] hope is the last chapter it ends on a
[13:49] really bright note and um it's really
[13:51] easy to get jaded as bitcoiners to think
[13:53] and Jad it in a negative way or like
[13:55] kind of become nihilistic of um because
[13:57] we're we're so aware of the way Fiat
[13:59] system works and it feels like the
[14:00] government and the the cartel and all
[14:03] these powers that be um they just have
[14:05] so much power and they do but Power
[14:07] structures rise and fall all the time
[14:10] and the last chapter of the book it's
[14:12] it's actually not a very political
[14:14] chapter um not not at all the last
[14:17] chapter is called every day is election
[14:19] day and what I mean by that is that
[14:22] everything you do is a vote for either
[14:25] the old system or like I guess the
[14:27] existing system or the new system um the
[14:30] comparison I make is uh election votes
[14:34] versus economic votes and and everything
[14:37] you do is economics when you turn on
[14:38] Netflix that's economics and you say oh
[14:41] I already paid for that at the beginning
[14:42] of the month so me watching this show
[14:44] versus that show that's not economics no
[14:46] that is you're telling Netflix where to
[14:48] put their
[14:49] dollars because this show people like to
[14:52] watch people don't like to watch this
[14:53] show everything you do you can't do
[14:56] something that's devoid of Economics you
[14:57] say well I'm not even going to eat a
[14:59] meal right now because that's I don't
[15:02] want to make an economic decision I'm
[15:03] going to try and disprove Brian no you
[15:05] made an economic decision there's now
[15:06] more money in your bank account you're
[15:08] maybe more hungry but you made an
[15:10] economic decision the restaurant you
[15:11] were going to go to now is devoid that
[15:14] money that you were going to get so
[15:15] everything we do is economic decisions
[15:17] and so the reason why I say economic
[15:19] decisions are more important than
[15:20] elective decisions or electoral votes is
[15:23] because say there's a there's an
[15:25] election with a 100 million votes and
[15:27] we're talking about a political election
[15:30] and candidate a gets 51 million votes
[15:33] and so he gets 51% of the votes
[15:35] candidate B got 49 million you got a lot
[15:37] of votes I mean 49 million is a lot of
[15:39] people but politics is a zero sum game
[15:42] so the day after the election those 49
[15:46] million votes have all the value of zero
[15:49] they literally mean zero the very next
[15:50] day because the guy that got 51% of the
[15:52] votes now gets 100% of the power now
[15:55] that doesn't mean your vote doesn't
[15:56] count I I believe that we should vote I
[15:58] I I do believe that we should but it
[16:00] just shows your vote has limited power
[16:02] now let's imagine that there's there's a
[16:04] company that last year they did a $100
[16:06] million in sales this year because they
[16:09] did something that people don't like and
[16:10] people start to boycott that company now
[16:13] that company only does $51 million in
[16:15] sales they get 51% of the sales that
[16:17] they got last year but the $49 million
[16:22] of votes that they didn't get this year
[16:25] every single one of those 49 million
[16:27] hurts them it hurts their bottom line
[16:29] it's not a zero sum game you've stripped
[16:32] 49% of their power away whereas the
[16:35] political official gets 100% of the
[16:37] power no matter what you did so it
[16:39] doesn't mean that we're going to take
[16:41] back the majority right away by making
[16:43] good decisions but you're you're
[16:45] stripping away the power of the existing
[16:47] structure in a different way than you
[16:49] can with politics and so as bitcoiners
[16:53] we inherently understand this to some
[16:55] degree right because instead of putting
[16:57] $100 in Fiat we saving $100 in Fiat we
[17:00] put $100 in our Cold Storage in Bitcoin
[17:03] you've just made a hundred votes you've
[17:05] taken a hundred votes and actually every
[17:07] economic vote we
[17:09] have against the old system has the
[17:12] power of two because not only are we
[17:14] taking one vote away from the existing
[17:17] system we're adding one vote to the new
[17:19] system so it's minus one on the on the
[17:21] existing system Ledger and plus one on
[17:24] the new system Ledger and so we don't
[17:26] need to change everything overnight
[17:28] increment change changing a few things
[17:30] per day um if you go through and you
[17:33] like audit your day you'll find that you
[17:35] make hundreds literally hundreds of
[17:37] decisions every single day you don't
[17:39] need to change everything you do um I
[17:41] still watch a lot of YouTube I'm I'm
[17:43] becoming more compelled to start
[17:45] watching Rumble and watch more things on
[17:47] X because YouTube's becoming a bigger
[17:50] and bigger problem right and so I can't
[17:53] I I I there's a lot of things I like on
[17:55] YouTube so I don't go I don't cut out
[17:57] YouTube cold turkey but I Tred to find
[17:59] more of the shows that I like on
[18:01] alternative sources that that places I
[18:04] like to to give my business and I'm not
[18:07] I'm not a hero because I'm not cutting
[18:09] out something overnight and going to the
[18:11] new system what I'm doing is I'm phasing
[18:13] those things out just like you start to
[18:15] stack SATs most people don't live 100%
[18:18] in Bitcoin they still have a little bit
[18:20] in the Fiat world and a little bit in
[18:21] the Bitcoin world that's fine if every
[18:23] human on earth was still a little bit in
[18:25] Fiat but they were kind of adding more
[18:27] to their Bitcoin stacks every day the
[18:29] Fiat world would slowly be deprived of
[18:32] oxygen and the the the Bitcoin world
[18:35] would would be built and so that's the
[18:37] hope at the End of This Book Is we walk
[18:40] through what the Fiat social layer is
[18:41] and how propaganda works I mean it's a
[18:43] deep dive if you're curious as to how
[18:45] propaganda works and how we got to where
[18:47] we are um this was my background this is
[18:49] my field of study in college is human
[18:51] Behavioral Science and how do how do we
[18:54] use propaganda to manipulate you um I
[18:57] have a couple videos coming out my my
[18:58] YouTube and Rumble channels pretty soon
[19:01] about the 11 ways that your politician
[19:03] uses propaganda so we're going to do uh
[19:05] 11 ways that uh candidate Harris is
[19:08] using propaganda and 11 ways that
[19:09] President Trump is using propaganda to
[19:12] manipulate voters even if whe and I'm
[19:14] I'm actually going to vote for Trump
[19:15] unless something changes um but I'm I'm
[19:18] releasing a video on the propaganda that
[19:19] he uses because I think it's important
[19:21] that we understand how people manipulate
[19:24] us because yes Trump is trying to
[19:25] manipulate my vote um and it's important
[19:29] we we understand that so that I can hold
[19:31] my political candidate accountable so
[19:34] yes we go through this murky stuff
[19:36] throughout parallel of um the way that
[19:39] the Fiat social layer works but at the
[19:41] end of the day I firmly believe the
[19:43] Bitcoin social layer the people that are
[19:45] adopting a new and better system are
[19:47] going to win because like you've heard
[19:50] before there's nothing more powerful
[19:51] than an idea whose time has come and I
[19:53] firmly believe that bitcoin's time has
[19:55] come it's fascinating really really cool
[19:58] um is it then also really important that
[20:01] we start living in the Bitcoin economy
[20:04] try to like accept Bitcoin payments try
[20:06] to maybe even pay for things in Bitcoin
[20:08] if we can like to to root with our
[20:11] economic power yeah I I I think so and I
[20:15] think that's very difficult we I have a
[20:16] whole uh section on hoddle versus spend
[20:19] um because that's contentious I I I've
[20:21] lost more followers on on Twitter over
[20:24] saying hey you should spend your Bitcoin
[20:26] um because bitcoiners don't like that
[20:28] they said oh you're that's a sell order
[20:30] every time that you're doing that and
[20:32] which which sometimes I guess you spend
[20:34] it at a business and the business might
[20:35] sell it so I understand that argument
[20:37] but we go through this we go through the
[20:39] Nuance of it um what I would say is if
[20:42] you don't want to spend your Bitcoin
[20:44] that's fine all you need to do to plug
[20:46] into the parallel economy is start
[20:48] accepting Bitcoin don't spend it just
[20:51] accept it so if you're a barber put in
[20:53] your Twitter profile that you're the
[20:54] Bitcoin Barber or sign up for orange
[20:56] pull app because orange pull app helps
[20:58] you find a Shameless plug right here
[21:00] orange bill app helps you find local
[21:03] bitcoiners and so the the reason why I
[21:05] say Barber is because I just found my
[21:06] barber on orange pull app I I I travel
[21:09] 30 miles I go way further for my barber
[21:12] than I would because he accepts Bitcoin
[21:14] I pass literally probably dozens of
[21:17] Barbers to go to my barber maybe even a
[21:19] hundred Barbers because it's so far away
[21:21] and in Southern California traveling 30
[21:23] miles it takes me 90 minutes to get to
[21:25] my barber I go to him specifically
[21:27] because he accept
[21:29] Bitcoin so my barber is doing better
[21:31] business now than ever because he gets
[21:33] all of his Fiat customers from those
[21:35] around him but because of orange pill
[21:37] app he's made all these other social
[21:39] connections of people in Southern
[21:40] California that he would have never
[21:42] gotten because nobody's going to travel
[21:44] 20 or 30 miles just to pay money to a
[21:46] Fiat Barber because at the end of the
[21:48] day good my barber gives good haircut
[21:51] there's other Barbers that I've gotten
[21:53] very close to me they also give good
[21:54] haircuts I want to participate in the
[21:57] parallel economy and so he doesn't do a
[22:00] lot of spending of Bitcoin but what he
[22:02] does do is he accepts Bitcoin and he
[22:04] gives a place for people like me to
[22:06] spend our Bitcoin same thing if you're
[22:07] the Bitcoin plumber if you're a graphic
[22:09] designer whatever you do put it in your
[22:11] orange pill out profile put it in your
[22:13] Twitter profile put it in your Noster
[22:15] profile do that and guess what all of a
[22:18] sudden you'll be having SATs trickle in
[22:21] for the work that you're providing and
[22:22] what I found is people who accept
[22:25] Bitcoin are far more likely to then go
[22:28] and spend Bitcoin there's this weird
[22:30] psychological phenomenon that comes with
[22:33] oh I bought these and so this is my
[22:35] savings versus I earn these from the
[22:38] parallel economy and you see that that's
[22:40] why we call it a circular economy you
[22:42] see the reality of this circular economy
[22:44] oh it came in so I don't have to worry
[22:46] that I'm never going to get these stats
[22:48] back right if I spend these back into
[22:49] the economy it actually gives me more
[22:51] connections to more people who spend
[22:53] SATs so what I found is when I started
[22:57] spending SATs I started Ed earning more
[22:59] sets right isn't that the whole premise
[23:02] of a business in Fiat in in the Fiat
[23:04] world I I invest money in my business
[23:07] why would I invest $10,000 to start a
[23:09] business because I have the inherent
[23:11] belief that that's going to be Capital
[23:13] well used and I will earn more than
[23:15] $10,000 by starting this business nobody
[23:18] starts a business to just have that
[23:20] money go away but when you spend SATs in
[23:22] the economy it's like investing in a
[23:24] business I spend a thousand SATs in the
[23:26] economy but that gives me more social
[23:28] connections and more economic
[23:30] connections until now there's more
[23:31] people that want to buy my stuff so I
[23:33] spend a th SATs but for whatever reason
[23:35] I earn three set 3,000 SATs because I
[23:38] provide more value than I'm taking in
[23:42] and that's the basis of any good
[23:44] economic actor in a in a in an economy
[23:46] so if you want more STS spend more SATs
[23:49] but if you don't want to spend SATs on
[23:50] day one just start telling people you'll
[23:53] accept SS yeah and I think if you're
[23:55] actually a person that lives on 100%
[23:57] Bitcoin
[23:59] um that's that plays out like we I think
[24:02] two or three days ago we went through
[24:04] the calculations of like having a little
[24:08] bit of a feat stack versus having
[24:10] everything in Bitcoin and spending those
[24:12] Bitcoin with apps that sell the Bitcoin
[24:15] and then spend it uh and it actually
[24:17] kind of works out even with the capital
[24:19] gain taxs because you only make capital
[24:21] gain taxs on on things that rise and we
[24:24] we made this calculations and it
[24:26] actually can work and there are also a
[24:27] lot of different other methods how you
[24:29] can do it I personally choose not to do
[24:32] it like I have my Bitcoin stack and I
[24:33] have a uh almost z% uh feat stack but so
[24:39] just enough that I can pay my bills uh I
[24:41] I choose to do it like that so I don't
[24:43] have to uh do a lot with my with my tax
[24:47] confirms but it it works you can work
[24:49] live on bitcoin right now and be 100% in
[24:51] there and that would be the best case
[24:53] scen area I guess for uh what you are
[24:56] seeing the par Bitcoin economy because
[24:58] then you really vote with all your
[25:01] economic power for Bitcoin even those
[25:04] places where you spend with Fiat because
[25:07] you cannot spend the Bitcoin you have a
[25:09] Bitcoin transaction uh with that like
[25:12] that's a little bit better than only
[25:13] having the Fiat uh transaction which is
[25:16] really really cool yeah and you know I
[25:19] it's a great point and everybody can go
[25:20] around about this a different way if
[25:22] you're contributing to the parallel
[25:23] economy if you're just holding and and
[25:26] storing Bitcoin that's you're do doing
[25:28] you're doing good work right we're
[25:30] contributing to
[25:31] this those who are like you said you
[25:35] accept it for your show and things like
[25:36] that those that are interacting with it
[25:38] on on an economic level are creating the
[25:41] the wheels of that industry a little bit
[25:43] better there will be a point where if
[25:46] enough businesses start to accept bit or
[25:49] not even accept Bitcoin hold Bitcoin on
[25:51] their balance sheet I think this is what
[25:52] Michael sailor is trying to do I think
[25:54] by him telling everybody how to keep a
[25:56] Bitcoin Treasury it then is step one for
[26:00] a lot of these bigger businesses to say
[26:03] okay at some point we could accept
[26:05] Bitcoin because we now hold it as a
[26:07] treasury asset and so we can just keep
[26:08] profits in Bitcoin um think about the
[26:12] impacts of this people don't want to
[26:14] spend their Bitcoin in the parallel
[26:15] economy right now because they're
[26:17] worried that businesses are going to
[26:18] sell like if you spend it with me I've
[26:20] got to sell it into Fiat because you
[26:21] know my my my business needs supplies
[26:23] and so to buy paper towels and toilet
[26:25] paper and soap and all that kind of
[26:27] stuff for my business I'm going to need
[26:29] to sell my Bitcoin which is going to you
[26:31] know put a suppression on the price and
[26:33] then I'm going to get into Fiat so it's
[26:34] it's not really helping anything well
[26:37] think about when my supplier the people
[26:40] that sell soap and toilet paper and
[26:42] paper towels and all that kind of stuff
[26:44] is soon as they start to accept Bitcoin
[26:46] now my business can get paid in Bitcoin
[26:49] and not have to get out of Bitcoin in
[26:51] order to buy my supplies that's when we
[26:53] will see this absolute hik uh hockey
[26:56] stick of Bitcoin parallel economy
[26:59] adoption because
[27:00] now Merchant excuse me uh customers
[27:04] won't have to be worried that the
[27:05] merchants are going to have to sell
[27:07] their Bitcoin to get out of it and I
[27:09] think we're just a few clicks away from
[27:11] that but all this stuff it's like
[27:12] building a plane while flying it Michael
[27:15] sailor has to do his stuff he has to get
[27:17] businesses excited about holding a
[27:18] treasury position and we the plebs have
[27:21] to get people excited about spending it
[27:23] in this micro parallel economy that's
[27:26] happening right now we get the macro
[27:27] parallel econ eom if we develop the
[27:29] micro parallel economy um and I mean
[27:32] there's just there's just so many things
[27:34] I know we were talking about price
[27:35] controls we kind of dabbled in that a
[27:36] little bit um there's things that the
[27:39] governments are doing that make parallel
[27:42] economies emerge 100% of the time or
[27:45] nearly 100% of the time um price
[27:47] controls being one of them and so it's
[27:50] better to have an organized parallel
[27:52] economy ahead of time because in the
[27:54] past every time this is the thesis I
[27:56] told you I'd get to the thesis of the
[27:58] book this is my long roundabout ways of
[28:00] doing it the thesis of the book is that
[28:03] every time Empire collapses whether
[28:05] you're talking about the Roman Empire
[28:07] the the Persian Empire the Soviet Union
[28:09] whatever it is at any point in history
[28:11] every time Empire collapses a parallel
[28:14] economy always Springs up in its wake
[28:17] now it's always in response to the
[28:18] collapse of Empire think about it the
[28:20] supply chains the the government who
[28:22] used to give you everything that
[28:24] collapsed and so the people need to fend
[28:26] for themselves and so either a barter
[28:27] system emerges or they they they resort
[28:29] to to Old Coins or metal coinage or
[28:32] whatever it is like local currencies and
[28:34] things like that a parallel system
[28:35] always reemerges but that only lasts
[28:38] four to 12 to maybe 15 years it lasts
[28:42] like half of a generation because it's
[28:44] it's decentralized which is great but
[28:46] unfortunately it's also highly
[28:48] disorganized
[28:50] decentralization is inherently
[28:52] disorganized and so when the new state
[28:54] power comes along like the Soviet Union
[28:56] collapses and then the state of Russia
[28:58] kind of re centralizes power it
[29:01] inevitably reabsorbs the parallel
[29:03] economy because it's so disorganized and
[29:05] so people go back to the state economy
[29:07] that happens 100 100% of the time Empire
[29:09] collapses parallel economy emerges state
[29:13] gets powerful and then the parallel
[29:15] economy gets
[29:16] reabsorbed Bitcoin represents the first
[29:19] time in human history where the parallel
[29:23] economy is not being built in response
[29:26] to the collapse of Empire it has a start
[29:28] it has been built before the collapse of
[29:30] Empire so the one thing that made it so
[29:33] that the that that the economy got
[29:36] reabsorbed the parallel economy got
[29:37] reabsorbed back into the state economy
[29:39] was the disorganization if we can create
[29:42] an organized enough decentralized
[29:44] economy we may never go back to a true
[29:48] State economy the Bitcoin economy may be
[29:52] the economy of the
[29:53] world so you're saying that we we might
[29:57] have the final money the the final end
[30:00] boss of of money the final end boss is
[30:04] Bitcoin I I love that a lot what can we
[30:07] do as plaps to to get their their faster
[30:10] well I mean I I really think spending
[30:13] Bitcoin is is or and like I said step
[30:15] one accept Bitcoin just try to find
[30:17] things to accept Bitcoin my kids get
[30:20] paid in their chores or for their chores
[30:23] in Bitcoin like my kids are highly
[30:25] incentivized if you want to it sounds
[30:27] stupid it sounds like you're
[30:28] participating in this this parallel
[30:29] economy you are if I'm not paying my
[30:31] kids in a few dollars of Fiat but my
[30:34] kids are now transacting in Bitcoin um
[30:36] doing it I'm like doing I'm
[30:38] participating in this right my kids are
[30:40] much more incentivized by a thousand
[30:42] SATs than $1 like to a kid unit bias is
[30:46] is very important um not only because
[30:49] the Thousand sat sounds like a lot but
[30:50] they do ask me well what's the dollar
[30:52] value of this and all of my kids we keep
[30:54] a spreadsheet of of of each of their
[30:56] wallets so they can see it at any time
[30:58] they can see the dollar value of their
[31:00] Bitcoin going up they're like wow I I
[31:02] haven't done anything for for two weeks
[31:05] and my my money increased in value you
[31:08] teach kids that and you you are setting
[31:10] up the Next Generation for the parallel
[31:12] economy why do the Communist why do the
[31:14] C the the centralized power the status
[31:16] whatever you want to call them why do
[31:18] they try to hijack our education systems
[31:21] because they know generational Warfare
[31:24] is how you win the game if we can train
[31:26] our kids to think in terms of a Bitcoin
[31:28] standard we will win the generational
[31:31] Warfare that is being waged and the way
[31:33] we do it in the immediate term is just
[31:36] by finding all the small ways to opt out
[31:38] if you're going to go to the grocery
[31:39] store and buy meat in Fiat well consider
[31:43] maybe trying to find a local Rancher um
[31:47] again orange pill app is an app that
[31:48] facilit it helps facilitate local
[31:51] connections so you might be able to find
[31:53] that person on Twitter but I can
[31:55] guarantee you it's a lot easier to find
[31:56] local bitcoiners on P because that's the
[31:59] that's the whole point of the app is to
[32:00] help you find people close to you find a
[32:02] local Rancher find somebody that will
[32:04] accept Bitcoin so instead of doing that
[32:06] transaction in Fiat you're now doing it
[32:08] in Bitcoin if you want to just buy
[32:11] Bitcoin for that transaction you know
[32:13] you don't want that to come out of your
[32:15] stash do that spend and replace or or
[32:18] replace and spend however you want to do
[32:19] it you might say well the exchange C The
[32:22] Exchange charges me you know 1% or two%
[32:25] to buy that Bitcoin well guess what when
[32:28] you swipe your credit card do you know
[32:30] how much the bank's charging you they're
[32:31] charging you a 3% Merchant fee now you
[32:35] think that the business is paying that
[32:37] because you don't see it on your credit
[32:38] card where do you think businesses
[32:41] charge the fees the taxes the fees all
[32:44] the the the expense that they have they
[32:46] charge it to you in the price of the of
[32:48] the meat or the unit so you will
[32:51] actually save money by spending 2% to
[32:54] buy Bitcoin and then to send that
[32:56] transaction even if you pay a th000 s
[32:58] for the transaction fee or whatever even
[32:59] if you're not using lightning if you're
[33:00] paying a few thousand SATs for that
[33:02] transaction fee you're probably going to
[33:05] save money by transacting in Bitcoin if
[33:08] you consider the true cost of what your
[33:10] Merchant fees are paying for for credit
[33:12] card processing and things like that so
[33:14] people say at the end of the day well
[33:16] you know what that's you're kind of
[33:17] splitting hairs here yeah I am splitting
[33:19] hairs because you want to talk about the
[33:20] Nuance what is my real answer my real
[33:22] answer is shut up and just do it right
[33:25] like kind of tongue and cheek it's like
[33:27] who freaking cares just start doing this
[33:29] stuff like let's not think about the tax
[33:31] implications and the this and the that
[33:33] and what if I lose a little bit of value
[33:35] on this transaction or whatever yeah I I
[33:38] get all those things and if you want a
[33:39] long exhaustive kind of nuance
[33:41] discussion then read parallel because
[33:42] that's what we go through but my podcast
[33:44] answer for this is if we want to build a
[33:46] better future let's just go out and
[33:47] build a better future it's like again
[33:48] being an entrepreneur and saying I want
[33:51] a really successful business but man
[33:53] that's going to be a lot of work and
[33:55] it's going to be really expensive to do
[33:57] that um and I'm not I'm not sure if the
[34:00] outcome is going to be what I want well
[34:02] then you're not cut out to to start a
[34:03] business like business to start a
[34:06] business or a podcast or any kind of
[34:07] entity you need to have vision of what
[34:10] the end goal is and you need to be
[34:12] willing to sacrifice in order to get
[34:14] there so if that's not your cup of tea
[34:16] then stack SATs and shill that is
[34:18] awesome that still helps bitcoin's price
[34:21] and and and perhaps adoption and all
[34:23] those things so God bless you but if you
[34:25] really care about the parallel economy
[34:27] then just start doing it just just start
[34:29] participating in it um it's like you
[34:31] know people say oh you know I come I
[34:34] come from a family that of of meager
[34:36] means and so I'm never going to be
[34:38] successful shut up like who cares like
[34:41] you because of the situation that
[34:44] doesn't dictate the outcome like you
[34:46] should be motivated that there's
[34:48] obstacles in your way if there's
[34:49] obstacles in your way the story that you
[34:52] get to tell your grandkids is 10 times
[34:54] better because if if if a generation
[34:56] from now we're telling everybody about
[34:58] oh I was I was there when the parallel
[35:00] economy was born of Bitcoin and it's
[35:01] like oh were the roadblocks Grandpa it's
[35:04] like no the government just gave us a
[35:06] free pass they said there was no tax on
[35:08] the transactions and actually you got a
[35:10] lollipop every time you spent Bitcoin
[35:12] they'd be like okay well Grandpa that's
[35:14] not cool but if you said you know what
[35:16] there was a parallel system and it was
[35:18] kind of like this kind of murky thing
[35:20] and it was it was it was expensive and
[35:21] it was hard to it was hard to find
[35:23] people where to spend my Bitcoin and you
[35:25] know what I thought I was going to get
[35:26] in trouble and you I didn't know what
[35:28] the government was going to say those
[35:29] are the stories that you tell your
[35:31] grandkids so if you want to be a
[35:33] freaking Legend then start start
[35:35] building this thing with us right like
[35:36] we're here for this like Get on Board
[35:39] and let's get the mission done I mean
[35:41] it's it it's honestly it's GNA make for
[35:43] a good story someday if you watch or
[35:45] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[35:47] I'll guess you already bought some
[35:49] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[35:52] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[35:55] in a hardware wallet my personal
[35:57] recommendation for harder wallet is the
[35:59] bit box it's super secure it's simple to
[36:02] set up it's also perfect gift for a
[36:04] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[36:07] exchange and you can get a 5% discount

[36:59] and last but not least I have something
[37:01] completely new for you guys I partnered
[37:05] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[37:08] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[37:11] saw created by anyone look at that
[37:14] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[37:16] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[37:19] the perfect subtle elent way to go out
[37:23] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[37:25] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[37:29] make sure to check out the link in the
[37:31] description for those amazing coin
[37:33] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[37:36] amazing I love them so much it was
[37:37] really hard for me to pick the one that
[37:40] I want to have because there are a lot
[37:41] of great options I went with the new
[37:44] transparency Edition they're all limited
[37:47] so grab yours those will not be
[37:50] available for a long time but there will
[37:52] come new models and new amazing designs
[37:55] along the way ah I I love that a lot and
[37:58] especially lot of also the part where
[38:00] you talked about the kids and having
[38:02] them directly on a Bitcoin standard
[38:03] because I think they have an major
[38:06] advantage they don't have to unlearn all
[38:08] the feat things like they don't have
[38:10] like a a 50 or 55 year old man who has
[38:14] lived through the whole fat game since
[38:16] 1971 for example uh he is has learned
[38:21] the fat system all his life and someone
[38:24] them comes up now with I don't know 14
[38:26] years old or 13 years old he comes up
[38:29] and there was always Bitcoin in his life
[38:32] uh and he has the advantage of maybe
[38:34] never really knowing about Bitcoin I
[38:36] mean never really knowing about Fe as I
[38:39] even me like I I got I'm all all in
[38:44] Bitcoin since I'm 21 years old so that's
[38:47] an amazing now I'm 25 so that's that's
[38:49] really cool to to be so young in in in
[38:52] Bitcoin um what do you think um what do
[38:55] you think can happen when a society that
[38:57] only has Bitcoin let's let's go a little
[39:00] bit out this parallel economy is
[39:02] actually the full economy how different
[39:05] uh is is that world I I think it changes
[39:08] spending Behavior to some degree I I
[39:10] think that you're really going to
[39:11] consider your purchases before you make
[39:12] them um because right now you're kind of
[39:15] incentivized to make impulse impulse
[39:17] decisions and impulse spends because my
[39:20] money's devaluing and so I might as well
[39:22] spend it now um we're not trained to to
[39:25] make or the average person isn't trained
[39:27] to make good economic decisions because
[39:29] you're holding a melting Ice Cube but
[39:31] when you have something that's growing
[39:34] and you know I don't think it's going to
[39:36] make it so people don't want to spend
[39:37] their money um but you will just say
[39:40] that is this thing worth it is it adding
[39:43] value to my life people ask me all the
[39:45] time when you know especially when I
[39:46] like I used to work in crypto years ago
[39:49] back in like 2017 and I'm a Bitcoin Maxi
[39:52] now so but like I have great stories
[39:54] from the crypto days because that that
[39:56] was that was the Wild West and man holy
[39:58] cow that industry is corrupt um but but
[40:01] people because they they knew I worked
[40:02] in crypto they always ask what what was
[40:04] the perfect time to sell what's the
[40:05] perfect time to sell your Bitcoin and I
[40:07] get regular people normies that say
[40:08] what's the perfect time to sell your
[40:09] Bitcoin the perfect time to sell your
[40:11] Bitcoin is to buy something in Bitcoin
[40:13] that's going to add value to your life
[40:16] um I'm a firm believer I don't want to
[40:18] spend my Bitcoin but if there's
[40:19] something that I can do to better my
[40:22] kids life better my wife's life have you
[40:25] know better my relationship with with
[40:26] anybody body I will spend my Bitcoin as
[40:29] much as I love to hold it because I
[40:32] value what money is for if we start to
[40:35] worship Bitcoin as God then we've lost
[40:37] track of of what money does now I hope
[40:41] that I was prudent in that that I
[40:43] acquired that Bitcoin and then it gained
[40:45] value so I was able to buy more with it
[40:47] than I would have if I had just held
[40:49] Fiat um but you think about what is a
[40:52] and we have a whole chapter of parallel
[40:54] that covers this and I think it's very
[40:56] exciting to think about
[40:58] what does an economy look like when you
[41:00] have a fixed supply of money what
[41:03] happens to the value because I think
[41:04] what people think is going to happen is
[41:06] bitcoin's going to go to $1 million
[41:07] someday and then it's going to stabilize
[41:09] and it's never gonna it's never going to
[41:11] increase in value because that's just 1
[41:13] million dollar is such a crazy number or
[41:14] even if it's 10 million it's just going
[41:15] to get to some big number and then it's
[41:18] just gonna it's gonna it's GNA tap out
[41:20] that is not how economics works if you
[41:23] have 21 million units of currency or 2.1
[41:26] quadrillion or whatever amount of SATs
[41:28] is um what is it 210 quadrillion or 2.1
[41:32] quadril I can't remember uh 2.1 2.1 yeah
[41:35] sorry there you go um you have 2.1
[41:38] quadrillion SATs in the world people
[41:40] think that that okay that's that's
[41:42] that's enough for the entire world well
[41:45] once all of those sats are being held if
[41:48] you have a fixed money supply and you
[41:50] have increasing productivity in your
[41:52] economy that means the value of each
[41:56] certificate on that that that economy
[41:58] which is your your your monetary unit
[42:01] every unit of currency you have
[42:03] increases in value it's like holding a
[42:05] stock in a company what happens when you
[42:07] have one share of a company and that
[42:09] company is now more productive they have
[42:11] more profit they're doing more business
[42:13] that one stock you have increases in
[42:16] value that's how claims on an economy
[42:19] work that's what money supposed to be
[42:21] it's supposed to be a claim on that
[42:23] economy and the productivity and so
[42:25] what's going to happen in this next in
[42:27] this next 10 years do we think
[42:28] productivity is going to go down or up
[42:30] well I think AI is going to make
[42:33] productivity absolutely explode I think
[42:36] you and I are going to have three AI
[42:39] models working for us at any given time
[42:41] to do all of our emails and to do all of
[42:43] our you know tedious tasks and stuff so
[42:46] it's going to free me and you up to do
[42:48] all sorts of other big picture things to
[42:50] expand our productivity so I'm going to
[42:52] become 40 times more efficient my my
[42:55] employees are going to become 40 times
[42:56] more efficient you're going to become 40
[42:58] times more efficient and so we're going
[42:59] to have an explosion of productivity in
[43:02] our economies and a fixed money supply I
[43:06] think the value of Bitcoin is going to
[43:08] things that you would have never
[43:10] expected I mean you're talking about a
[43:12] billion dollars per unit of Bitcoin per
[43:16] whole Bitcoin in a in an economy that's
[43:18] growing because again 21 million
[43:22] everything in the world divided by 21
[43:23] million is this astronomical number you
[43:27] think of like drive through a city look
[43:30] at every building you're talking about a
[43:31] $400 million building a $500 million
[43:34] building a $40 million building on the
[43:36] corner there just like a little building
[43:37] on the corner $40 million when
[43:40] everything in the world is priced in
[43:43] Bitcoin the Bitcoin like I I don't want
[43:46] to call it a bubble but that like that
[43:47] that that container that thing that's
[43:49] trying to hold all the air in we'll just
[43:50] call it we'll call it a balloon for this
[43:52] example that balloon that's trying to
[43:55] trap all that economic value in it as
[43:57] those things inside the balloon increase
[43:59] that balloon has to get bigger Bitcoin
[44:02] is going to be absolutely massive and
[44:05] we've never seen one currency trap all
[44:09] the economic value of the world in it
[44:10] the US dollar has pretty much done that
[44:12] to some degree but there is still a lot
[44:14] of value in the world that is valued in
[44:16] other currencies and I don't I don't
[44:18] think that little Sovereign currencies
[44:19] and stuff won't exist I don't think the
[44:21] US will clearly have their own Sovereign
[44:23] currency to some degree but Bitcoin will
[44:25] everything in the world will be priced
[44:27] in Bitcoin and that balloon is going to
[44:29] be absolutely massive it's going to be
[44:31] so difficult to keep all that value in
[44:34] and unfortunately or fortunately that
[44:36] balloon doesn't pop that that balloon
[44:39] expands because Bitcoin doesn't break
[44:41] right just because you put more economic
[44:43] value into Bitcoin it doesn't mean the
[44:45] miners can't process or the nodes can't
[44:47] process it it's like the infrastructure
[44:49] for Bitcoin is infinitely scalable and
[44:52] so we can trap all of the the economic
[44:54] value of today and all of the EC
[44:57] economic value of 50 years from now
[44:59] which is going to be exponentially more
[45:00] than we have right now will be trapped
[45:02] in that 21 million unit base currency
[45:05] which is called
[45:06] Bitcoin all right that's a beautiful uh
[45:09] explanation I love it a lot um you
[45:12] brought up I think one to times uh the
[45:14] Bitcoin socially I think that's a word
[45:16] or a phrase that gets thrown around a
[45:19] lot um how do you define it like what's
[45:22] the Bitcoin social layer yeah the
[45:24] Bitcoin social layer simply put is any
[45:27] that is furthering the mission of
[45:28] Bitcoin if you you stack stats you're
[45:31] you're on the Bitcoin social layer if
[45:33] you are tweeting uh to the you know to
[45:36] to some billionaire Fiat Maxi have fund
[45:39] staying poor you're part of the Fiat or
[45:41] you're part of the Bitcoin social layer
[45:43] like you're you're doing a podcast
[45:44] you're part of the Bitcoin social ler
[45:46] you're you're part of this
[45:46] interconnected group that is furthering
[45:48] this Mission um like who would you call
[45:51] I all my references are like uh American
[45:54] references sorry but it's like who would
[45:57] call an American revolutionary it's like
[45:59] anybody that contributed to the American
[46:01] Revolutionary War right were the were
[46:03] the revolutionaries were they only the
[46:05] guys that marched out onto the
[46:06] battlefield and and and shot their
[46:08] musket no I think it was the people that
[46:10] that were the regular people that were
[46:12] also contributing to the war effort
[46:14] maybe they were they were furthering the
[46:15] propaganda message of the of the
[46:17] Revolutionary cause or they were
[46:19] contributing um funds and resources to
[46:22] the cause or whatever it was there was
[46:24] there were so many people in a
[46:26] revolution that never fired a musket and
[46:28] so we might say that well Michael
[46:30] sailor's that he's the Revolutionary or
[46:33] uh Peter McCormack or Robin S or these
[46:36] any one of these people that's like out
[46:37] there in the public eye those are
[46:39] revolutionaries for sure you guys are
[46:41] revolutionaries but the guy that just
[46:45] again my barbar who accepts some SATs
[46:47] for a haircut he's a revolutionary he's
[46:49] part of the Bitcoin social airer and
[46:51] guess what when you're a part of a
[46:52] network that Network becomes we also we
[46:55] all understand met C law and how Network
[46:57] affects work every time somebody plugs
[46:59] into the Bitcoin social layer the
[47:01] network becomes exponentially more
[47:02] valuable so we're we're creating more
[47:06] value every time somebody comes on and
[47:09] the good news is I I don't think there's
[47:11] ever been a day where the Bitcoin social
[47:13] layer has gotten smaller nobody gets
[47:16] into Bitcoin and then gets out of it
[47:17] people get into crypto and then get out
[47:19] of it because they got burned they held
[47:20] their money on FTX or something like
[47:22] that nobody gets into Bitcoin and then
[47:26] gets out of bitco coin so today there
[47:28] are more people in Bitcoin than there
[47:30] were
[47:30] yesterday yesterday there were more than
[47:32] there were the day before tomorrow
[47:34] there's going to be more than there are
[47:35] today so the trend is your friend the
[47:39] trend is that the Bitcoin social layer
[47:41] is growing and it's growing fast and
[47:43] every time there's more people connected
[47:44] to it there's more people that I have in
[47:47] my social network that gives me more
[47:49] influence it gives you more influence it
[47:50] gives them more power and influence and
[47:53] guess what it's taking power and
[47:54] influence away from the existing system
[47:57] because that network is losing people it
[47:59] is losing nodes from its Network there
[48:01] are less people plugging in or there's
[48:04] there's less people connected to the
[48:05] Fiat social layer than there were
[48:07] yesterday so if it's about who's running
[48:10] up the scorecard the Bitcoin social
[48:12] layer is winning and I'm betting and you
[48:15] are as well I'm betting everything I
[48:17] have on it um and this isn't this isn't
[48:20] a decision we made easily we probably
[48:22] made this decision kind of begrudgingly
[48:24] the old way of life was was easy but we
[48:27] saw that there was going to be a clear
[48:28] path to Victory and so we adopted the
[48:30] Winning Side really really cool I also
[48:32] feel like um I think with niik when I
[48:34] spoke with simply Bitcoin uh we we kind
[48:37] of brought that comparison up with um
[48:40] content creators podcasters people that
[48:42] are just outspoken about Bitcoin not not
[48:45] even only in in social media but also
[48:47] like uh uh offline I spoke yesterday
[48:50] with someone who is out there every day
[48:54] going around the city and speaking with
[48:56] random people about Bitcoin with his
[48:57] Bitcoin shirt like he that those uh with
[49:01] the content creators with the podcast
[49:02] with everyone those are the soldiers of
[49:05] the new information Warfare I feel like
[49:08] when when people ask me oh can can
[49:10] Bitcoin create the new war new world war
[49:13] no we are already in there like it's a
[49:15] information Warfare like it's a cyber
[49:16] warfare we we have to be we have to
[49:19] stick up for for for what's right and
[49:21] for what's what's good and I think your
[49:24] explanation goes really really nicely in
[49:25] there now
[49:27] what role do you think Nostra and
[49:30] decentralized social media uh plays into
[49:33] that or maybe even places like Rumble
[49:37] and a by the way my podcast I because of
[49:40] Simply Bitcoin I was finally also uh
[49:42] getting off my ass and also put my sh on
[49:47] Rumble finally I did it it's a lot of
[49:50] work uploading all the episodes on on
[49:52] Rumble also but I finally also did it
[49:55] how do you see the role of uh completely
[49:57] decentralized like Nostra but uh a
[50:00] little bit more centralized but uh a
[50:04] little bit more freedom of of speech
[50:06] than other players like Rumble like
[50:08] Twitter or X so couple a couple things
[50:11] there I think it's awesome that you're
[50:13] you're switching it over to rumble or
[50:14] not switching over but you're adding
[50:16] you're creating that content for rumble
[50:18] right it's creating that Marketplace so
[50:20] anybody if I want to as a viewer go over
[50:22] to rumble I now have more content it's
[50:24] the same thing with the Bitcoin parallel
[50:25] economy it's the same thing with this I
[50:27] would actually consider Rumble and what
[50:29] you're doing with that part of the
[50:30] parallel economy it's all part of the
[50:31] same thing but it's it's providing now a
[50:34] place for me to go it's giving me those
[50:36] options so it makes it easier for
[50:37] viewers to make that switch as well so
[50:39] you making the switch makes it easier
[50:40] for somebody else to make the switch
[50:41] just like me spending stats makes it
[50:43] easier for somebody else to spend stats
[50:45] same idea um but you're doing that as an
[50:47] investment you're not going to get a
[50:49] return on your on your investment for
[50:51] putting putting those videos over there
[50:52] there's just not enough viewers for that
[50:54] to be your sole income like you couldn't
[50:57] switch over to rumble entirely you're
[50:59] doing it as an investment you're you're
[51:01] doing it knowing you're not going to get
[51:02] a return on investment now but three
[51:05] years from now what all the time that
[51:07] you took to put your videos on over on
[51:08] Rumble that could be the greatest move
[51:11] you've ever made as a podcaster because
[51:13] again you saw ahead of the curve you put
[51:15] the time in when it didn't make sense
[51:17] you know it it's not going to give you
[51:18] any financial gain right now it's a
[51:20] long-term it's a long-term uh bet you're
[51:22] making on that I think that's the right
[51:23] bet I I actually I I I believe that
[51:25] firmly um the sorry the the second part
[51:29] of your question or the the main part of
[51:30] your question can you repeat that for me
[51:32] it was uh about oh Noster right yes
[51:35] decentralized and first decentralized
[51:37] Noster absolutely critical for what
[51:40] we're doing we need to have
[51:41] decentralized communication platforms
[51:43] that's that's a massive piece of this we
[51:46] need to have a check I actually don't
[51:47] think we're going to ever have to go
[51:49] over to Noster entirely you know why I
[51:52] don't think we're going to have to do
[51:53] that because Noster exists if Noster
[51:57] didn't exist we would have to go to
[52:00] something like Noster and it just
[52:01] wouldn't be there but because Noster
[52:04] exists that acts as a check on
[52:07] centralized for social media they can
[52:09] only get so bad because there's an exit
[52:12] the most powerful thing any human being
[52:15] can do and this is certainly true in
[52:17] business so I'll just say but it's it's
[52:18] it's true for every element in life the
[52:20] most powerful thing you can do in
[52:22] business to somebody is say no when you
[52:25] say no you you have all of the Power and
[52:28] so when you tell Facebook no I don't
[52:30] need you because I can go to Oster
[52:32] Twitter Elon I I like you right now but
[52:35] hey you want to get crazy guess what no
[52:38] I will not use Twitter anymore I will
[52:39] not use x I'm going to go to Noster but
[52:42] elon's smart he knows that Noster exists
[52:45] he he again I think he probably shares
[52:47] the Miss mission to some degree it's
[52:48] kind of Elon I feel like is like the
[52:50] enemy of my enemy as my friend I don't
[52:52] trust Elon but I do think I don't think
[52:54] there's an evil cabal out there I think
[52:56] there's a hundred evil cabals and
[52:58] they're all fighting each other and so I
[52:59] think that Elon is uh is definitely
[53:01] doing war and some of those things align
[53:03] with us right now but again Elon could
[53:05] switch or somebody else could come in
[53:07] and buy Twitter and take that over and
[53:09] all of a sudden that platform is H is a
[53:11] problem as well we would desperately be
[53:14] wanting Noster and if we're not building
[53:17] Noster then then that would be that
[53:19] would be a huge problem if we're not
[53:20] putting content out there or whatever
[53:22] like I think that that that's that's
[53:23] very critical um it's just like the
[53:26] cbdcs I think when cbdcs come around
[53:30] cbdcs will not be nearly as bad as they
[53:32] would have been had Bitcoin not existed
[53:35] cbdcs would be the the blight of
[53:38] humanity they would be the most
[53:40] tyrannical tool in human history if
[53:42] Bitcoin didn't already exist Bitcoin is
[53:45] a giant middle finger it's a giant no to
[53:48] cbdc so cbdc will come out they're not
[53:51] going to be great they're going to be
[53:52] worse than what we have right now but
[53:53] they're not going to be as bad as they
[53:55] would have been because bitcoiners and
[53:57] everybody in the world even people that
[53:58] aren't on bitcoin are aware of Bitcoin
[54:01] we have this no ready to go if you get
[54:04] too crazy and so the presence of Noster
[54:07] is like a preemptive attack on
[54:09] censorship um but if the if the
[54:13] establishment if the people that are you
[54:14] know Facebook and those people if they
[54:16] don't see that becoming a more thriving
[54:19] robust uh Network then then they're
[54:22] actually going to stop caring that it
[54:24] exists they're going to start to get
[54:25] worse they're going to encroach on our
[54:27] freedoms even more because they said
[54:29] well people actually don't want to use
[54:30] Noster um so we can actually just stick
[54:33] it back to these people because
[54:35] ultimately they're going to use our
[54:36] platforms so it is important that we go
[54:38] over and that we that we use those
[54:40] things and build out those things so in
[54:41] the same way I'm making a a case for
[54:43] spending your SATs we need to start
[54:46] dabbling in those types of things um my
[54:48] worry with Noster is that it doesn't
[54:50] have the economic incentives of Bitcoin
[54:53] um where like to run a node um or to
[54:56] relay for for Noster you you're not
[54:58] getting like mining Rewards or or or
[55:00] anything like that um it's kind of more
[55:01] similar to node operators for Bitcoin
[55:03] you run a node because well actually
[55:05] with with Bitcoin there is there there
[55:07] is that because then you're you can
[55:09] validate your own transactions and all
[55:10] that kind of stuff so so there is kind
[55:12] of an economic incentive to running even
[55:13] a Bitcoin node or certainly to be a
[55:15] minor there's an economic incentive so I
[55:17] hope that some economic incentives kind
[55:19] of get built into Noster so that um it's
[55:23] not all Mission driven people now that's
[55:25] the great thing is that there's enough
[55:26] people that care about their privacy and
[55:28] their free speech that they will
[55:29] contribute it to this network so perhaps
[55:32] voluntary uh interaction with the
[55:34] network is going to be enough but I do
[55:36] think that that's why that's why we need
[55:39] a balance of central entities like
[55:42] Rumble um or we need Central entities
[55:45] like orange bill app where like it's
[55:46] terrible to say oh we're a central
[55:47] entity no we're a company that has the
[55:50] same Mission as something like Noster
[55:52] we're we're we're trying to connect
[55:53] bitcoiners we're trying where where
[55:55] nosters for your online connections
[55:57] orange pill apps for your offline
[55:58] connections do we think that orange pill
[56:00] apps the solution for everything in the
[56:01] Bitcoin social layer no it's literally
[56:04] just this this one piece to meet other
[56:06] bitcoiners in real life I think that's
[56:08] very very important we also have a
[56:09] really good spam filter and and a filter
[56:11] to to filter out Bots I think that's
[56:13] going to be one of the biggest problems
[56:15] we have in the future going forward our
[56:17] AI Bots it's going to be very convincing
[56:19] um somebody's going to be talking on the
[56:21] other end of a text message or even a
[56:23] video call like this and and you might
[56:25] not be able to tell if it's a real
[56:26] person or not proving somebody's a human
[56:28] is going to be incredibly valuable in
[56:31] the next few years and so orange app is
[56:33] probably one of the only apps in the
[56:34] world that's going to help you do that
[56:35] you're going to know who's a human so
[56:38] orange pill app by being able to verify
[56:40] hey I shook hands with his people this
[56:42] person or hey I shook hands with Nico
[56:44] from Simply Bitcoin and then he shook
[56:46] hands he met Robin at a conference
[56:48] somewhere I now know Robin is real
[56:51] because I have social connection social
[56:53] proof to know that Robin is real that
[56:56] also
[56:58] validates Robin on Noster I know he's a
[57:00] real person I know he's not just a CI a
[57:02] c CIA bot somewhere that was created to
[57:06] you know OB you know be be controlled
[57:08] opposition or something like that right
[57:10] it it also validates and it verifies and
[57:12] it helps reinforce the Noster Network
[57:14] because uh orange bill app has helped
[57:16] validate that person in real life so
[57:19] these things have this Synergy and
[57:20] that's how any revolutionary any
[57:23] Revolution works you need to have
[57:24] Synergy amongst different Technologies
[57:26] and that's that's one of the three
[57:29] necessary components for a paradigm
[57:32] shift this is one of the things I cover
[57:33] in parallel is in order for a paradigm
[57:36] to shift meaning the way the world
[57:38] operates in order for it to shift you
[57:40] need to have three things and if you
[57:41] don't have those three things you won't
[57:43] have a paradigm shift there's been all
[57:45] sorts of movements that tried to change
[57:47] history and they didn't it's because
[57:49] they didn't have these three things they
[57:51] didn't have a will for change okay there
[57:54] there's a problem and people wanted to
[57:55] change that's that's all the time people
[57:57] always want change so how come the
[57:58] world's not always changing well it's
[58:00] because there has to be a social layer
[58:02] that connects those people right because
[58:04] who cares if a million people want
[58:06] change but those million people don't
[58:07] know each other okay the social layers
[58:09] what the glue that holds all that will
[58:11] for change together but the third thing
[58:13] is technology the people want change
[58:16] there's a social layer but they they
[58:18] need a technology so that they can play
[58:20] on an even playing field with the big
[58:22] boys right the that the powers that be
[58:24] have incredible power when well now
[58:26] technology evens the playing field
[58:28] Noster orange p app Bitcoin those things
[58:32] are Rumble those things are absolutely
[58:34] necessary for a paradigm shift we have
[58:36] to have all three of those components
[58:38] the good news is that the table's set
[58:41] the stake is ready that that like the
[58:43] you got your your Ruger like you you're
[58:46] ready to
[58:47] go we have everything in place it's just
[58:50] now we need to act that's that's a a
[58:52] beautiful description it's also uh it
[58:54] reminded me when you said uh it's
[58:56] important that we have uh Nostra in
[58:59] place also for places like ax and Rumble
[59:02] um do you think that Bitcoin then could
[59:06] even benefit the US dollar because they
[59:09] all of the sudden see there's a aent
[59:11] that can actually uh really G get get uh
[59:15] way more powerful or we have to be a
[59:17] little bit more careful with spending
[59:19] money and a little bit more careful with
[59:21] printing money do you think that's a
[59:23] possibility or is the system already on
[59:26] a projectory with the feat system where
[59:28] they have to print so they can keep it
[59:31] one year or two years more alive yeah I
[59:34] mean
[59:35] yeah there's just no chance that the
[59:37] Fiat system survives it's it's literally
[59:39] a downward spiral that that nothing can
[59:42] plug that hole there's a very
[59:45] interesting caveat to that and if
[59:48] Trump you know if he has Robert F
[59:50] Kennedy in his C cabinet who actually
[59:53] does seem to understand Bitcoin a little
[59:54] bit Trump seems to very much be
[59:57] uh appealing to the Bitcoin base but not
[59:59] know much about Bitcoin but if they do
[60:03] adopt a treasury position of Bitcoin not
[60:07] even backing the US dollar I don't think
[60:08] they're ever going to say oh bitcoin's
[60:09] backing the US dollar but there is a
[60:12] cheat code here that can happen one time
[60:15] in history and and Humanity can shoot it
[60:18] shot this one time or it never will
[60:20] could be the only time in history that a
[60:22] fiat
[60:23] currency gets a little bit of life to it
[60:26] beyond what it should have because you
[60:28] can infinitely print dollars and Bitcoin
[60:31] is scarce they and and when you have a
[60:33] big pool of economic value versus called
[60:37] Bitcoin a relatively small pool of
[60:38] economic value $1 out of the big pool
[60:42] doesn't change the big pool but $1 into
[60:44] the small pool has a much bigger effect
[60:47] and so you could drain funds print money
[60:50] out of the big pool of theat and every
[60:53] billion dollars that comes out of that
[60:55] pool isn't going to affect the value of
[60:57] the dollar inflation is not going to go
[60:58] up very much because of that billion
[60:59] dollars coming out but every billion
[61:00] dollars going into Bitcoin is going to
[61:03] make the value of Bitcoin go up at a
[61:05] faster Pace than you devalue your
[61:07] currency so the US government
[61:09] theoretically could use the sheet code
[61:12] to buy so much Bitcoin they could buy
[61:14] enough Bitcoin they could buy 50
[61:17] trillion dollars worth of bitcoin
[61:18] legitimately buy $50 trillion worth of
[61:21] bitcoin and then pay off the US debt and
[61:24] so that downward spiral of having to
[61:26] borrow more money in order to pay off
[61:30] the existing debt that that that in that
[61:33] it's like somebody that has a credit
[61:35] card balance that's maxed out and then
[61:37] they get another credit card to pay that
[61:38] initial credit card they don't have
[61:39] enough money in their account that's
[61:41] what's happening we just keep borrowing
[61:42] more we keep getting more credit cards
[61:44] to pay our existing debt if we had a way
[61:47] to buy
[61:48] Bitcoin to where we could pay off all
[61:50] our credit card debt theoretically yes
[61:53] the value of the dollar would have gone
[61:54] down quite substantially in that period
[61:56] but the the debt would be erased and so
[61:59] the cycle could kind of be reset yes
[62:02] your minimum the smallest type of US
[62:05] currency wouldn't be a dollar any more
[62:06] than maybe a $100 bill might be the
[62:08] smallest unit of currency yes we would
[62:10] have devalued our currency but it would
[62:12] then be stable for a relatively uh
[62:14] relatively long period of time the thing
[62:17] is once the US has done that I don't
[62:20] have a lot of faith that they won't go
[62:22] back to borrowing money going forward
[62:24] that's the only other problem is yes we
[62:26] would have reset the clock we would have
[62:28] yes we would have devalued our currency
[62:29] but we have no debt and so we can let
[62:32] the the US dollar can live on for
[62:33] another 75 years but sure enough a
[62:36] socialist will come in and say guess
[62:38] what now we can afford to give everybody
[62:40] free college and we can give everybody
[62:42] free healthcare and we can give
[62:43] everybody all so all the promises will
[62:45] start over again the cycle will start
[62:46] again but it will be the longest
[62:48] currency to to live in human history if
[62:52] somebody does that yeah it could
[62:55] basically
[62:56] uh prolong in the life of feed but not
[62:59] uh prevent it from its death eventually
[63:03] I agree a lot um now we have one
[63:07] question that every guest uh gets uh
[63:10] what can we learn from you besides all
[63:12] the things that we already heard from
[63:14] you I am a father of four um I have
[63:18] three biological girls and I have my son
[63:20] is adopted um I growing up I always
[63:23] thought I'd have like two kids and
[63:25] that's it I'm at four kids I'm 38 years
[63:27] old I probably shouldn't be having more
[63:28] kids I would I would have 10 more kids
[63:30] if uh if if if that my my perspective on
[63:35] leaving a legacy and a family Dynasty
[63:38] and not saying a dynasty and like oh
[63:40] wealth and prosperity all that but like
[63:41] leaving a dynasty of people of children
[63:44] who have good values that are providing
[63:47] for their families and making the world
[63:48] a better place I really like producing
[63:51] humans that that do that kind of thing
[63:53] and so whether I'm done it for or
[63:55] whether we adopt some more children or
[63:57] my wife and I you know we get pregnant
[63:59] again I I would I would have you know
[64:00] more children um and I think that uh my
[64:04] perspective on that has changed quite a
[64:06] bit so that that's actually something
[64:07] that that I'm kind of not wrestling
[64:09] through but it's just something that's
[64:10] on my mind a lot in life and so I'll
[64:12] share that with you guys here
[64:13] today uh wonderful have more kids guys
[64:16] amazing I love it a lot uh perfect then
[64:19] we come to the endro of the podcast
[64:20] where the previous guest is asking a
[64:22] question for the next guest without
[64:23] knowing who the next guest actually is
[64:25] uh um we have the question from previous
[64:27] gu it is a really cool one what was your
[64:30] F what was your worst feat experience my
[64:33] first Fiat experience was was was
[64:35] probably what oh no uh worst sorry my my
[64:39] worst Fiat experience yeah yeah I don't
[64:41] know if I said best sorry my worst Fiat
[64:43] experience I think led to it would
[64:47] eventually lead to me becoming a
[64:48] bitcoiner but it was years before um
[64:50] when my wife and I when we graduated
[64:52] from college we had saved up we knew we
[64:54] were going to get married cuz we were
[64:55] College sweethearts we both worked
[64:56] full-time we saved a ton of money we
[64:58] saved we saved enough money to to put a
[65:01] down payment on a house but I graduated
[65:03] from college in 2008 so that was the
[65:05] great financial crisis and I walked into
[65:07] the bank with my wife um like hey look
[65:10] at we have this big big down payment for
[65:12] 22 years old I thought this was this
[65:14] huge amount of money and of course the
[65:16] bank's going to give me a loan for a
[65:17] house this is like the American dream
[65:19] come true the banker laughed us out of
[65:23] the bank he because this is again
[65:25] Financial crisis and you're 22 years old
[65:27] you don't have any credit history he
[65:28] literally laughed at my credit history
[65:29] he goes you have two years of he credit
[65:31] history you think we're going to loan
[65:32] you a house wait you only made this much
[65:34] money he laughed me out of the bank so I
[65:37] remember I remember thinking I graduated
[65:39] from college early I worked full-time my
[65:42] wife worked full-time she graduated from
[65:44] college early man we are hard workers I
[65:46] I went in thinking we we've done the
[65:49] work to buy a home and yet this guy
[65:53] standing between me and this house and
[65:54] is laughing in at my work I just
[65:56] remember thinking that that was so
[65:58] disrespectful um and I remember at that
[66:00] point being like you know Screw the
[66:02] banks like I don't I don't I don't need
[66:03] them and I don't want them that that's a
