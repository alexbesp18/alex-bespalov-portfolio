[00:00] we reached the alltime high before the
[00:02] Haring event this never happened in the
[00:04] history of Bitcoin the whole world will
[00:06] adopt it tomorrow no this takes time I
[00:09] have my 12 words my feet phrase in my
[00:12] head and I can just go away and start
[00:14] from the beginning anywhere in the world
[00:16] I'm not anymore willing to work for
[00:18] someone who's not appreciating my time
[00:21] you will not need a exit strategy for
[00:23] anything because Bitcoin will be this
[00:26] exit strategy Bitcoin respects your time
[00:29] nobody will force you to understand it
[00:32] to use it it's totally up to you I see
[00:34] the biggest problem and danger and
[00:37] censorship happy Haring day grais yeah
[00:40] also happy Haring day um I have to say
[00:43] uh I didn't celebrate uh yeah the Hing
[00:45] event um this night because of course
[00:49] it's a it's a unique event and I think
[00:52] we all know what this um yeah what what
[00:55] is the meaning for the Bitcoin Haring
[00:58] and also for the future
[01:00] and um I think it has really more like a
[01:03] long-term impact than a shortterm impact
[01:07] but I didn't celebrate because um yeah I
[01:09] knew um we had uh we have this podcast
[01:12] um near episode this morning so um yeah
[01:16] yesterday in the evening I just watched
[01:18] a film on Netflix and then I went to bed
[01:21] like at 11:00 p.m. and yeah so
[01:24] everything was fine that that's very
[01:26] good yeah it's like interesting what to
[01:28] I think you even wrote I saw on the the
[01:30] blog an article about the the Haring uh
[01:32] so like everything we we need to know
[01:34] about the Haring I did not read it but I
[01:36] just saw a headline uh maybe for people
[01:39] and I'm always aware for the audience
[01:41] because there's always someone that's
[01:43] quite new in the space um maybe let's
[01:45] just quickly summarize what's the Haring
[01:48] uh did everything run as as you expected
[01:50] it to to run it's the fourth Haring in
[01:53] in Bitcoin uh and what's the
[01:54] significance of
[01:55] it yeah well if we talk about the Haring
[01:59] um well this is like um I always say
[02:02] like a feature which um Bitcoin has and
[02:05] this Bitcoin housing event is happening
[02:08] um yeah every two two 200,000 10 blocks
[02:13] so every every four
[02:15] years and um what I really like about
[02:19] the the housing it's like the fact that
[02:23] you know at every time what is going to
[02:26] happen so it's not like in the fiat
[02:31] currency system for example um yeah you
[02:34] don't know um how money how much money
[02:37] they will print in the future and with
[02:39] Bitcoin and especially with this Bitcoin
[02:41] Haring event you you always know like
[02:44] every four years this event is is going
[02:47] to happen it's inevitable it's going to
[02:50] happen and uh yeah the the block rewards
[02:54] are are going to cut um in half so
[02:56] before before yesterday we had like a um
[03:01] reward for the miners um in an amount of
[03:04] six um six um comma 2 two five Bitcoins
[03:10] and now with this event this night um
[03:13] yeah the block reward was splitted into
[03:16] the half so into um
[03:20] 3.125 and I think um yeah also for the
[03:24] future you you you you can see and you
[03:26] know already right now what is going to
[03:30] happen in the future of course then for
[03:32] example when we talk about the Haring in
[03:34] the in the future we will get to some
[03:37] point maybe in if we have a little a
[03:39] little look further in 2090 or 209 and6
[03:44] when the when when the halvening at this
[03:47] um point is happening for example it
[03:49] will take uh much more time to to to
[03:53] mine like one Bitcoin and it may will
[03:56] take up to one year but um yeah it's you
[04:01] you know to every Point what will happen
[04:04] and I think this is a it's a great
[04:06] feature
[04:08] and I might get this wrong but I think
[04:10] even like the last Bitcoin will take
[04:12] like a 100 years or something like that
[04:15] yeah the really last one yeah yeah yeah
[04:18] that's that's uh that's amazing yeah and
[04:21] what do you because this this Haring for
[04:22] me is a special one because we for the
[04:24] first time ever we hit the alltime high
[04:26] before the Haring right now we are not
[04:28] there but we hit it before for the
[04:30] Haring uh which was not there before uh
[04:33] and also interesting for me is that we
[04:35] have a major Bitcoin ETF launch which
[04:38] has major inflows uh and now even the
[04:42] Hong Kong ETF got launched which also um
[04:46] it's it's not a nothing Burger but it's
[04:48] it's it's small compared to the American
[04:51] one um what do you is there anything
[04:55] special about this cycle is there
[04:57] anything that you see like uh this could
[05:00] this could potentially impact the price
[05:03] and the adoption in an even creative way
[05:07] uh and I don't like to to use the word
[05:10] super cycle uh but this is what the
[05:13] discussion is with every cycle and I
[05:15] think Michael saor also talked about the
[05:18] the 10year gold rush and he basically
[05:21] avoided the word super super cycle but
[05:23] 10y year Gold Rush is kind of the theory
[05:26] about a super cycle uh so what's your
[05:28] thoughts on on this of like the next
[05:30] next years and the trigger of ETF and
[05:33] cycle yeah well I think um definitely
[05:36] the situation in which we are right now
[05:40] it's a it's a completely different
[05:41] situation than in the past because right
[05:45] now um yeah the the ETF started in the
[05:49] US and also for example with the fact
[05:52] that we reached the old alltime high
[05:55] before the harving event this never
[05:57] happened in in history and the history
[05:59] of Bitcoin and I think this is a really
[06:03] good um yeah proof and this is showing
[06:07] to me that um you cannot always take the
[06:11] the the facts and the datas from the
[06:12] past and um yeah because with this
[06:16] actions with uh the the the reaching the
[06:19] all all-time high um it's it's never
[06:22] happened so um things can go um in a
[06:25] different way in the future and I think
[06:27] we all have to be aware of it right now
[06:30] um the the ATF started in in the US and
[06:33] it seems like also in in Hong Kong there
[06:35] are um yeah they are going to to provide
[06:40] them to their clients and to their
[06:41] customers and I think this is a is a
[06:44] it's a really big game changer because
[06:47] not only in terms of what kind of um or
[06:52] what what what amount of money will will
[06:54] will go in into into the
[06:57] NTFS but I think it's I see it more like
[07:00] a a really big game changer in terms of
[07:04] um yeah um education and to show to the
[07:09] um
[07:10] publicity okay Bitcoin it's here it's
[07:13] it's not disappearing and Bitcoin is
[07:16] growing day by day month by months year
[07:19] by year and uh either you accept it and
[07:23] you go with it and you are open to the
[07:26] topic or or not so I think yeah for the
[07:29] future for for long term it will it will
[07:31] have a huge
[07:32] impact but I would also say we have to
[07:35] wait for the following two to three
[07:38] years to make like a real and profound
[07:41] summary to to have a further look and to
[07:44] say okay this happened uh the last two
[07:47] three years and um it's not happening um
[07:50] or the change will not be like huge from
[07:54] today till tomorrow so um we have to be
[07:57] still patient but it's it's a really big
[08:00] game changer yeah definitely and the low
[08:03] time preference we always have to keep
[08:04] because without the low time preference
[08:06] we get frustrated and I think um the
[08:09] adoption is fast but it's not as fast as
[08:14] we thought because every time someone
[08:15] comes in Bitcoin you're like oh that's
[08:17] amazing the whole world will adopt it
[08:19] tomorrow no this takes time uh people
[08:22] have to educate themselves I've myself
[08:25] needed three years to go from uh Bitcoin
[08:28] is a scam do I might look into it a
[08:32] little bit more and then I needed a
[08:34] weekend of deep research to go from okay
[08:37] it's a really scam to uh okay I will buy
[08:41] a little bit of it let's let's see it a
[08:43] little bit more and then it took me from
[08:45] there once I researched it once I had an
[08:47] skin in the game it took me a year to go
[08:50] all in I sold all my stocks I sold all
[08:53] my other properties and assets and went
[08:55] all in in Bitcoin slowly but surely like
[08:57] one year is not too much of a time so
[09:00] it's really interesting what what
[09:02] Bitcoin does for you and if you have a
[09:03] low time preference you will benefit
[09:06] from it greatly and you also moved from
[09:10] uh Germany to the Canary Islands As I
[09:13] understood it right yeah correct correct
[09:16] uh so my my first question and I
[09:19] think I know some of the anwers because
[09:21] I'm quite I was also in in in Germany
[09:24] but what's bad about Germany like why
[09:26] did you move yeah the the thing although
[09:29] the reason why I moved it's first of all
[09:32] since when I was a
[09:33] child I always had this desire deep in
[09:36] me to to go away and to live somewhere
[09:39] else to live abroad because um of many
[09:42] different reasons because of the climate
[09:44] because of the weather and also because
[09:47] of the culture because what I didn't
[09:49] like at Germany at all I felt like
[09:53] especially when I when I finished school
[09:56] and when I started um to study and when
[09:59] I uh work for the first time I felt like
[10:03] um in my personal um friend cycle that
[10:08] if you have a good job for example you
[10:10] ask someone and if you don't have a good
[10:13] job or if you are not earning so well
[10:17] you are nobody and this is like like a
[10:20] kind of a
[10:22] mentality I I don't like because for me
[10:24] like um human being for me a person it's
[10:29] not defining herself by by her job so
[10:32] for example um I respect for example um
[10:36] a person who is working in the
[10:38] government or in a bank um in the same
[10:43] way for a person which is I don't know
[10:45] working in a hotel or working in a bar
[10:47] in a restaurant and this is like um yeah
[10:50] like kind of um a culture and the
[10:52] mentality I don't I don't like so for me
[10:55] it was always clear to to go somewhere
[10:57] abroad where the cult
[10:59] um is more open and um yeah of course
[11:04] you know in especially in Europe or
[11:05] especially in Germany the weather and
[11:07] the winter it's it's not so good um we
[11:11] have some quiet um yeah month during the
[11:14] winter and in Germany where you see no
[11:17] sun and also this affects your vitamin D
[11:21] level and um mayor mentality and um yes
[11:25] so therefore I I was always had this
[11:28] desire to live abroad and on top of this
[11:31] my father lived also when he was younger
[11:34] he worked for a company which is called
[11:36] tusen cro I think in Germany it's quite
[11:38] um yeah common or or famous this company
[11:42] and for this company when he was younger
[11:44] he worked in Venezuela and um South
[11:47] America so I think maybe from my father
[11:49] I have it a little bit in my veins you
[11:51] know this desire to to explore the world
[11:55] to see new things and U yeah H that's a
[11:59] that's a amazing and uh the obvious
[12:01] question to ask is like why not move to
[12:03] El Salvador
[12:04] now well this is right now I have to be
[12:07] honest and right now I am in a point at
[12:10] my life where I'm really
[12:13] thinking what will be my next steps
[12:16] because right now here in the Canary
[12:18] Islands in Grand Canaria I live since
[12:21] almost 9
[12:22] years and actually it was always always
[12:26] in my life my goal to go to um Central
[12:29] America to South America and um but of
[12:33] course um when I went earlier back in
[12:36] the days to the Canary Islands um this
[12:39] was a move um I made it because of the
[12:41] job and because for example the Canary
[12:44] Islands or Spain in generally is is the
[12:47] most nearest like in in terms of culture
[12:50] to to to Latin America so um I think
[12:54] more and more times my journey here in
[12:57] the caner islands will
[13:00] yeah this journey will will end May soon
[13:03] and um it was like um like um step in
[13:08] between and I had here of course I
[13:10] enjoyed the time I had here so far so
[13:13] much I'm so thankful for everything the
[13:16] the culture the people gave to me but
[13:20] right now I'm really thinking about to
[13:22] to go away and um to start a new
[13:25] adventure and to start and to begin from
[13:27] zero again and and this will be May in
[13:30] El Salvador or May in Costa Rica or in
[13:33] Panama but um yeah I'm really thinking
[13:35] of it and already um planning a little
[13:38] bit to to realize this step um yeah
[13:43] hopefully at the end of the year or
[13:44] maybe next year really cool and I think
[13:48] when we talk about Bitcoin and uh having
[13:51] a personal savings account a personal
[13:55] account in Bitcoin helps a lot with
[13:57] those life decisions how did this help
[14:00] you to be like a little bit more free
[14:02] maybe Al like have the mindset like okay
[14:05] I can move with my whole Capital
[14:07] wherever I want because Bitcoin is quite
[14:08] movable I don't have to worry about oh
[14:11] how do I sell my stock portfolio can I
[14:13] take this and that into a new country
[14:15] where do I have to pay taxes with it um
[14:19] how did Bitcoin uh help you in that
[14:22] regard yeah Bitcoin helps me um
[14:25] regarding this a lot it's really it's
[14:28] really insane when I think about it
[14:30] because right now not only me we all
[14:32] have the chance to to to make uh faster
[14:36] decisions and to say if I'm not happy
[14:39] where I'm living I'm taking my my seat
[14:42] phrase I have 12 words in my head and
[14:45] I'm going away and um I think this is
[14:49] this is really mindblowing it's it may
[14:52] seems like a like a simple fact but if
[14:54] you think about it um and when I when I
[14:58] look at my person personal
[14:59] situation um I can sell here my car um I
[15:03] can sell my three four things I have I I
[15:06] have my 12 words my th phrase in my head
[15:10] and I can just go away and start from
[15:12] the beginning um anywhere in the world
[15:15] and uh this is really insane that with
[15:18] Bitcoin you have this power to to take
[15:21] all your wealth and to take it with you
[15:24] wherever you want it's it's it's unsane
[15:26] and and of course I think for all the
[15:30] people who who wants to go away it's
[15:33] it's also like a feature which which
[15:36] helps you and um which makes things a
[15:39] lot easier uh in terms of to take such
[15:42] important decisions so um yeah it's it's
[15:44] really insane and I love it is really
[15:48] cool and it helps a lot and uh you also
[15:51] agreed on before we started the show
[15:53] that we talk about uh that you got a
[15:56] month ago laid off uh and I'm really
[16:00] curious like did did Bitcoin like
[16:03] mentally as you have then a stable
[16:06] savings account did this help you uh and
[16:08] and how did this whole transition and
[16:11] and this uh period was for you yeah
[16:14] Bitcoin helped me in this situation um
[16:16] definitely um I would say in this
[16:18] situation Bitcoin is definitely my my my
[16:22] Lifeboat so um I'm so
[16:25] thankful yeah for to having the luck to
[16:28] to understand Bitcoin like a few years
[16:30] ago and um as you mentioned earlier a
[16:34] few years ago I also went crazy when I
[16:36] really understood Bitcoin I sold all my
[16:38] properties my car my motorbike and um
[16:42] because I knew um this is the the right
[16:45] way and thanks to to my actions in the
[16:50] past right now um it doesn't matter to
[16:53] me if my company fired me because I made
[16:56] my my homework in the sense you know and
[17:01] um right now um thanks to this I can
[17:04] sleep I can sleep um I am free and so um
[17:11] yeah uh I would say this is It's I'm
[17:14] really thankful to for the way I I have
[17:16] taken the last years and um right now it
[17:20] doesn't matter to me um if a company
[17:22] fires me because also I understood and
[17:26] I'm not I'm not anymore um willing to
[17:29] work for someone who's not appreciating
[17:32] my time because this is the most
[17:34] valuable thing I think we all have in
[17:36] our in our life our our lifetime our
[17:39] energy and it's either it's it's even
[17:41] more scarcer than Bitcoin our own
[17:44] lifetime because you never know when
[17:45] this journey here on this planet will
[17:48] will end so um yeah but the firing was
[17:52] not uh about Bitcoin that you have
[17:54] Bitcoin right I heard some stories that
[17:56] they got laid off because they talk too
[17:58] much about Bitcoin in the
[18:00] workplace well actually in the workplace
[18:02] I didn't talk about Bitcoin but of
[18:04] course um in my or at my LinkedIn
[18:08] profile um May as you know I'm posting
[18:11] almost every day like um yeah facts and
[18:15] new postings so in my private life
[18:18] everything is about Bitcoin and what I
[18:21] have to mention and right now I remember
[18:23] I can remember that my chef told me once
[18:25] in the past months Chris if you had this
[18:29] passion for for which you have for
[18:31] Bitcoin if you have this passion for for
[18:33] your job then you would be the best
[18:36] worker and uh it would be it would be it
[18:40] would be really nice if you if you could
[18:42] get this Pion or transmit this P passion
[18:45] which which you have for Bitcoin into
[18:47] your job so maybe it was also like um a
[18:51] fact uh that they didn't like it that I
[18:54] talked so much about um Bitcoin but for
[18:56] me I have one thing clear
[18:59] um when and I don't care about if it's
[19:02] my employer or if it's my boss if
[19:06] somebody would tell me um please don't
[19:08] do this on LinkedIn or please do not uh
[19:11] talk about Bitcoin um I will not do this
[19:14] because Bitcoin for me it's like it's
[19:16] like a life mission and uh it's for me a
[19:19] tool to help others so I don't really
[19:21] care what um what my boss uh would tell
[19:25] me about Bitcoin because it's it's
[19:27] Bitcoin is my passion it's my Mission
[19:29] and um I want to help the people to
[19:32] understand Bitcoin so yeah is it then
[19:35] also like Bitcoin kind of like a freedom
[19:37] Catalyst uh on a on a even personal
[19:41] level yeah definitely definitely because
[19:44] um you you embracing you're learning
[19:47] you're educating yourself and I always
[19:49] say Bitcoin it's like the you can
[19:52] compared with the spider bite in the
[19:54] film Spiderman so for example you get
[19:57] this bite from the spider and right now
[19:59] you have this power and now it's up to
[20:01] you to use this power or not but nobody
[20:06] will force you to understand it to use
[20:09] it it's it's totally it's totally up to
[20:12] you and I all always say also um to the
[20:17] people I only can show you the door I
[20:21] only can try to to to show you the truth
[20:25] but when I'm showing you the door it's
[20:27] by yourself to go through this store and
[20:30] to take your own actions so yeah
[20:33] definitely it's you cannot force anyone
[20:35] into this and it's um I discussed a lot
[20:39] with people how to orange peill one and
[20:42] the most effective way I came to know I
[20:44] think we even talked about it on a on a
[20:45] Twitter space together uh I don't know
[20:48] if it was on that one uh but the most
[20:50] effective one is just like living a
[20:52] great life and saying that you are a
[20:54] bitcoiner then people will associate
[20:57] that you are a great person you're like
[20:59] happy you're giving in the society stuff
[21:01] like that and then you're also like a
[21:02] bitcoiner so I think that's is always
[21:05] the best way to the orange PE orange
[21:07] peill people and I'm I'm getting really
[21:09] defensive about orange peing someone uh
[21:12] when someone comes up to me and wants to
[21:14] know something I'm gladly helping
[21:16] everybody uh but I'm not going around
[21:20] except from the internet on the internet
[21:22] I'm doing that because it's just just a
[21:24] room where I can throw in stuff and
[21:26] people that don't want to know it they
[21:28] can just block or mute me pretty easy
[21:31] but in in real life with family friends
[21:34] and uh yeah now work in Bitcoin so in
[21:38] Bitcoin with co-workers I only have good
[21:41] interactions uh and but with family and
[21:44] friends uh I I never press the Bitcoin
[21:47] topic and it's so funny for me when
[21:49] people like oh now the price is going up
[21:51] now you're talking more about it no no
[21:53] no now I get asked more about it I never
[21:57] bring up Bitcoin as a topic but nobody
[21:59] asks me when it's 18,000 and everybody
[22:01] asks me when it's 70,000 so uh that's
[22:04] that that's seems to be the difference
[22:06] here yeah yeah well I I've met also my
[22:09] own experience in in terms of orange
[22:12] pilling and uh to give you an example my
[22:15] best friends here on the on the Canary
[22:17] Islands um it's a couple they are they
[22:19] have also the same age like me um 33
[22:22] years old and it's a couple and um I try
[22:25] to to to explain them Bitcoin how it's
[22:29] working and uh it was one evening we
[22:31] were in the bar we had some drinks and
[22:33] then after it I decided or I I I told
[22:36] them well let's go to my home um I will
[22:39] show you like I will turn on like a
[22:41] quick Bitcoin doco and um I wanted to
[22:44] show them the advantages and like a
[22:46] small small documentary in Spanish
[22:49] language and you know how it ended up we
[22:52] started the doco like I don't know at 12
[22:56] midnight and we ended up uh um yeah
[22:59] discuta so we discussed until 5: in the
[23:03] morning because they didn't understand
[23:05] that they're supporting the government
[23:07] and all their actions and since then I I
[23:11] understand and now I know um yeah to to
[23:15] Really to try to convince someone it's
[23:17] not the right way if someone wants to
[23:19] ask you and wants to know something of
[23:22] course everybody can ask me and I'm
[23:24] lucky to help and um to to to recommend
[23:28] them some things and to help them but um
[23:32] like a really aggressive orange pilling
[23:34] I made bad experience with this and um
[23:38] yeah so why do why do you think people
[23:41] don't get it like what are the
[23:42] misconceptions that people still have uh
[23:45] when uh trying to understand
[23:48] Bitcoin well I think uh it test to do
[23:51] something with the mindset and also with
[23:54] the psy psychology it's like a
[23:57] psychology
[23:59] because if you want to understand
[24:01] Bitcoin you have to be open you have to
[24:03] be open against something new and I
[24:07] think it's it's our nature when
[24:10] something appears which is new and
[24:12] something appears which we don't know
[24:15] much about it we are trying maybe to
[24:18] avoid it because we try to to to live
[24:22] our lives in a in a in a comfort zone we
[24:26] are feeling good in this comfort zone
[24:28] and we we want we don't want to leave
[24:30] this comfort zone because this may can
[24:33] be a risk to leave this comfort zone so
[24:36] I think it's it's really up uh to to to
[24:39] the
[24:39] mentality and um also depending on the
[24:42] character so we have people which are
[24:46] generally from nature like really
[24:49] open-minded and um they're questioning
[24:51] some things and also they're trying to
[24:53] make their own opinion but I think most
[24:57] of people
[24:59] yeah there when there's something new
[25:01] they they don't they don't trust it and
[25:03] they don't make the effort to to to make
[25:07] their own opinion and to make their own
[25:09] research in order to understand um a
[25:12] topic or Bitcoin a little bit better so
[25:16] um yeah I think that's uh also like a
[25:19] reason why you founded Bitcoin Mastery
[25:21] right yeah exactly because it's like a
[25:24] small project um where I am writing a
[25:27] Blog articles and I'm also active on um
[25:30] social media like um Twitter X or
[25:33] LinkedIn and my main goal with this
[25:36] little project with this little blog or
[25:38] homepage I have is only to to provide
[25:42] people who want to learn to provide
[25:45] informations um in a free form because I
[25:48] am feeling like I want to give something
[25:51] away um I think right now it's the time
[25:54] for me has come to to help other people
[25:58] and
[25:58] um to give something a to give something
[26:01] back because for
[26:03] example I am living my life like I think
[26:06] I have to give more than I take from the
[26:09] people and it's not always easy to live
[26:12] like this but I always trying to remind
[26:15] myself day by day to give more than I
[26:18] take and with Bitcoin Mastery it's like
[26:20] my own small project where I'm trying to
[26:23] provide informations absolutely for free
[26:26] and um yeah everyone who who wants to
[26:30] inform theirselves they they um yeah
[26:34] invited to for example to read my blog
[26:36] articles or to follow me on social media
[26:38] but my main goal is to provide
[26:40] informations and not to force anyone
[26:44] anyone to to learn Bitcoin because I
[26:48] think not all or everyone has to
[26:50] understand Bitcoin and not everyone has
[26:52] to get it um and I'm I'm also confident
[26:57] or I know that
[26:58] that not all the whole world will
[27:00] understand Bitcoin and it's it's okay
[27:03] I'm fine with this but uh for for the
[27:05] people who are yeah open-minded and um
[27:09] wants to learn new stuff um I want to
[27:12] give them like free informations really
[27:15] cool and and for like new people
[27:16] listening that they want to check out uh
[27:19] more more Bitcoin content they want to
[27:21] read books they want to listen to stuff
[27:23] watch videos uh is do you have like um
[27:27] um Library do you have like an a list of
[27:31] of things that you usually recommend as
[27:33] an educational material for for new
[27:36] bus um yeah of course I think in these
[27:39] days uh thanks to God we have like a lot
[27:41] of yeah um information either in the
[27:44] internet or either when it comes to book
[27:46] so um the book I always would um
[27:50] recommend for for for a newbie for
[27:53] example one of them is is of course the
[27:55] Bitcoin standard but also I would may
[27:59] say for absolutely beginner the Bitcoin
[28:02] standard can be a little bit
[28:05] overwhelming so maybe it can be a lot
[28:08] for example there's also another book um
[28:12] well in Germany which is called the
[28:14] tranic Horse so
[28:17] that's I think um this is also like a
[28:21] really good um Bitcoin um book and it
[28:23] shows you the different use cases um for
[28:27] Bitcoin in many different um countries
[28:31] all over the world and this is something
[28:34] where you see well okay Bitcoin has
[28:36] already an impact in many different in
[28:40] many different countries and uh it
[28:43] empowers people it helps
[28:45] people so yeah I think I'm not sure if
[28:49] it's the same one uh from Alex cladin
[28:52] it's exactly exactly yeah stand uh check
[28:55] your financial privilege I don't know if
[28:57] it's just if the English one is check
[28:59] with financial privilege and the German
[29:01] ones is then the Trojan Horse uh but uh
[29:05] maybe yeah when you check out books by
[29:08] Alex glatstein check your financial
[29:11] privilege Trojan Horse uh and the little
[29:14] Bitcoin book he has a lot of interesting
[29:16] material just for people that want to
[29:17] like Wonder now what exactly this book
[29:20] is yeah yeah yeah um yeah really really
[29:23] cool uh that's that's amazing and we
[29:25] also talked about uh I think uh on a on
[29:28] a space together Bitcoin as the exit
[29:31] strategy uh and uh like first of all
[29:35] like what what do you mean with Bitcoin
[29:37] as the exit
[29:39] strategy well Bitcoin um yeah is the
[29:43] exit strategy or can be for everyone
[29:45] exit strategy
[29:47] because as I said earlier Bitcoin gives
[29:51] you the power back so Bitcoin gives you
[29:53] the power of money back for example
[29:57] Bitcoin respect is respects your time
[30:00] you you have invested in your work and
[30:04] um Bitcoin it's like uh the most and the
[30:08] greatest saving tool we we have
[30:11] discovered so far and I think in our
[30:14] human history so with Bitcoin and what I
[30:17] want to say with this if you if you have
[30:20] Bitcoin and uh even if you have like um
[30:24] simple saving plan uh I'm I'm really
[30:27] confident if you have like a low time
[30:28] preference and um like a longtime
[30:31] Horizon you you will not need a exit
[30:35] strategy for anything because Bitcoin
[30:37] will be this exit strategy but of course
[30:40] it's Al also to to very important to
[30:43] understand that you need um patience
[30:47] that you need patience and um when you
[30:49] think about Bitcoin it's not about
[30:51] getting rich uh from from over overnight
[30:55] it's it's not about this definitely not
[30:58] but um if you're trying to to understand
[31:00] Bitcoin and you got to the point where
[31:02] you understand Bitcoin I think also then
[31:05] you will get to the point really fast
[31:07] where you understand um what huge impact
[31:11] Bitcoin can have for your own future and
[31:15] how it can give you back the power and
[31:17] how it can
[31:18] Embrace um yeah a lot of a lot of areas
[31:22] in your personal life I told you a lot
[31:24] about 21 Bitcoin the best place for me
[31:27] to buy Bitcoin directly on a Bitcoin
[31:29] only exchange but now let's talk about
[31:32] how to secure your Bitcoin once you got
[31:34] Bitcoin you don't want to leave them on
[31:36] Exchange you want to take self custody
[31:40] you want to take responsibility of your
[31:42] own Bitcoin that's why I recommend
[31:45] getting a bitbox bitbox is an amazing
[31:48] wallet where you can not only keep your
[31:51] Bitcoin in a simple way very secure you
[31:53] can even create a passphrase with that
[31:56] passphrase you can basically create a
[31:59] hidden wallet on the device itself make
[32:03] sure to buy your bitbox in the link down
[32:06] in the description and with code Robin
[32:08] you even get a 5% discount yeah 100% And
[32:11] it's also lets me think of like the the
[32:15] future the adoption that we are coming
[32:17] to we have the deaths we have like when
[32:19] we just think of like four years ago we
[32:21] had the first publicly traded company
[32:23] that went into Bitcoin we did not had
[32:25] any countries like El Sal that embraced
[32:28] it so publicly now we have ETF launch
[32:31] like there are so many steps of adoption
[32:34] that come into the in into Bitcoin and
[32:37] and really drive the adoption in a major
[32:40] way um what do you think are the the
[32:43] major adoption barriers like the the
[32:45] things that we have to overcome uh to
[32:48] get to even a a bigger Mass adoption
[32:52] because right now we are still like kind
[32:54] of Niche like when you talk with the
[32:56] general population people don't don't
[32:58] understand what Bitcoin is uh what what
[33:00] what do you think are the catalysts that
[33:03] we actually come to Major uh uh Mass
[33:07] adoption is it just the price action do
[33:09] we have to do something
[33:12] else well I I would go so far and I
[33:15] would say the the biggest thing would be
[33:18] is for me it's like education it's it's
[33:20] all about um
[33:22] education we we have to try to educate
[33:25] to people um we have to try to provide
[33:28] more informations to the people and I
[33:31] think this in a very very in the easiest
[33:34] way
[33:35] possible
[33:37] because um yeah I think in these days um
[33:41] you have if you want to inform yourself
[33:43] about Bitcoin you have some some really
[33:46] good YouTubers um for example people
[33:49] like you who are making like a podcast
[33:52] you have other YouTubers um either in
[33:54] Germany or all around the world which
[33:57] are pro providing some really Val
[33:59] valuable informations so I think um a
[34:02] huge adoption will come with education
[34:06] of course also with price but I think
[34:09] it's it's so important to educate the
[34:11] people because I would go so far and I
[34:13] say um in these days it's it's totally
[34:17] it's it's it's not easy to it's not
[34:20] totally easy to understand
[34:22] Bitcoin in these days and um it's it's
[34:26] either not so hard to to to understand
[34:29] Bitcoin but yeah for me it's like for
[34:31] absolutely newbi or for a person for a
[34:34] human being who wants to trying to Lear
[34:36] Bitcoin it's it's it's not so easy may
[34:39] as we think so um there there is like
[34:43] for me um there there is like May a
[34:45] small barrier for the people to get into
[34:48] this Rital and um to try um to to get
[34:52] more about Bitcoin so I think um
[34:55] education it's it's so
[34:58] important and um I see the biggest um
[35:01] threat or danger in terms of Education
[35:05] or in terms of um adopting Bitcoin all
[35:09] over the world this planet um I see the
[35:12] biggest problem in danger and
[35:15] censorship um as we all know for example
[35:17] this year um Mrs uh lion um Mrs fine and
[35:24] dor she said um it's all about
[35:28] misinformation and disinformation so and
[35:32] I think um I I I can May imagine like um
[35:37] a point in the future where we are not
[35:40] anymore allowed to to speak about
[35:43] certain things and um and even if we if
[35:47] we talk about the truth or even if we
[35:50] provide uh like um like true datas and
[35:55] statistics if the government or
[35:58] who whoever doesn't want that we talk
[36:00] about the truth that they are trying to
[36:04] to to put us down and and there I really
[36:06] think there there is a biggest danger
[36:08] because Bitcoin Bitcoin you cannot um
[36:12] forbidden Bitcoin Bitcoin is there
[36:14] Bitcoin in my opinion will not disappear
[36:17] so I really see the biggest danger in a
[36:20] in a certain censorship that we're not
[36:22] anymore able to to say what we want to
[36:25] say and especially when when it comes to
[36:28] the
[36:29] truth yeah it's uh I mean when we see
[36:33] now especially Twitter with e mask um we
[36:37] are kind of seeing a reverse of that
[36:39] Trend uh we having possibility with
[36:42] Nostra but even Twitter is a tool which
[36:47] not the masses use like YouTube is so
[36:50] much bigger than Twitter Instagram is so
[36:52] much bigger than Twitter uh it's like 5x
[36:55] 3x of that Twitter is along and they're
[36:58] trying really to to be mainstream and be
[37:00] like an a platform for a lot and still
[37:03] Twitter is not the the Holy Grail of
[37:05] free speech it's just way better than
[37:07] the other platforms the other big
[37:09] platforms then we have nostro that's
[37:11] obviously really really cool but not too
[37:13] many people use it like it's uh it gets
[37:16] along it's it's the UI improves a lot
[37:19] but censorship is um an important topic
[37:24] uh that especially yeah what's to say
[37:27] saying America is the Innovation uh
[37:30] Power and The Innovation Force then we
[37:33] have China that drives to copy
[37:36] everything and then the EU is regulating
[37:38] it uh so we are just like trying to put
[37:41] on restraints uh to to all the stuff
[37:44] that's happening and it's it's sad to
[37:46] see but I think uh Bitcoin is like a
[37:49] hope for for kind exactly that because
[37:52] it's not possible to censor Bitcoin you
[37:54] can just regulate yourself out of
[37:57] Bitcoin
[37:58] and really make the EU hunger in a in a
[38:02] big way if if they don't adopt Bitcoin
[38:05] but yeah that's that's the only thing
[38:06] they can do right yeah yeah exactly
[38:09] exactly and I think for example in these
[38:11] days we have like so many so many um
[38:15] valuable podcast and I think day by day
[38:17] also a new podcast or new a new YouTube
[38:20] channel is um is created and and rising
[38:24] and for example today for example in the
[38:27] in the D area or in Germany we have some
[38:30] really great podcast and YouTube
[38:32] channels and they're speaking about
[38:35] topics where I think the government they
[38:37] don't want that we speak about this
[38:39] topic and the government they don't want
[38:41] that the people are listening to it so
[38:42] for me I see it's such as a powerful
[38:45] thing because day by day people are
[38:48] watching podcasts and especially in in
[38:51] this situation for example it doesn't
[38:54] doesn't um care if we look about Germany
[38:57] or Europe Europe or about the global
[38:59] situation people know something is
[39:01] happening they they they feeling it they
[39:04] know something is is going to wrong and
[39:06] and people are always questioning more
[39:08] and more and with these podcasts and
[39:12] YouTubers who are providing this
[39:13] informations and who are willing to
[39:17] speak about dangerous topics uh people
[39:20] will see this day by day and um yeah
[39:24] they they are waking up m step by step
[39:28] and I and this I really see like like
[39:30] also like a big danger but um yes thanks
[39:34] to God and in Europe or in Germany it's
[39:36] still possible to to watch these
[39:38] podcasts and thanks to all these
[39:41] podcasts and YouTubers who are providing
[39:43] who are talking about such important
[39:46] topics they are helping I think um the
[39:49] society um yeah to see the truth and to
[39:52] start questioning theirselves and um to
[39:55] start questioning what is happen
[39:57] happening here and to try to understand
[39:59] what is really happening and U yeah yeah
[40:03] amazing i l it and it's really really
[40:05] cool and I try to always like get uh the
[40:09] guests also to speak about what they are
[40:11] currently really passionate about I
[40:13] think as bitcoiners we always evolve and
[40:15] we always like at at uh different angles
[40:19] or different perspectives in in the life
[40:21] or different stages also in the Life uh
[40:24] and uh you're also in a really
[40:25] interesting situation right right now
[40:27] and that's why I'm asking like what are
[40:29] you currently really passionate about
[40:31] like what what are you studying besides
[40:33] Bitcoin besides uh doing something in
[40:36] that regards is there any topic that
[40:38] stands out for you like that's really
[40:40] one that I'm extremely passionate about
[40:42] and that is where my most learning time
[40:45] goes in
[40:46] now well I would say um beside Bitcoin
[40:50] it's in terms um I'm really interested
[40:52] and I was always interested in to yeah
[40:56] when it comes to my mindset when it
[40:58] comes to my to my own character to my
[41:00] own person I always trying to improve
[41:03] myself in in any way I can because I
[41:07] think yeah this the whole life is a
[41:10] journey and I think we always have to
[41:12] try to improve and we always have to try
[41:16] to see our our errors our mistakes and
[41:20] um I would say beside Bitcoin um I don't
[41:23] I don't really have like a like um yeah
[41:27] big passion like for I have like for
[41:30] Bitcoin for for another thing but um I'm
[41:33] always trying to to improving myself and
[41:36] to learn yeah more about me to getting
[41:38] to getting me better my my yeah my my
[41:42] own cor and the only thing what I really
[41:46] want and this is what I'm working right
[41:47] now is I want to I want to improve this
[41:51] world I want to make the world a better
[41:53] place and um I know for me it's not
[41:56] possible to change uh the world uh by
[41:58] myself and um but I also know for me for
[42:03] myself I have like I can have a small
[42:05] impact and that's totally fine I'm
[42:07] totally fine with it and um my my
[42:11] biggest passion beside Bitcoin is to
[42:13] help other people to help other people
[42:15] and with Bitcoin I have this tool and
[42:18] now it's possible for me to help other
[42:20] people because earlier back in the day
[42:22] and also like a small child I always
[42:25] knew and I felt it
[42:27] that something that something in this
[42:30] world is is is not going well something
[42:33] is going wrong and um but uh I always
[42:37] wanted to help people but I didn't know
[42:39] how to help people for example I always
[42:42] was thinking about going uh abroad maybe
[42:45] to South America Central America to work
[42:47] like in a school or in a project where I
[42:50] help people or CH childrens who lost
[42:53] their childrens but um right now with
[42:56] people I have this tool this piece what
[42:59] was actually missing for me the my
[43:01] entire life and with this it's possible
[43:04] for me to yeah to change the world to
[43:07] make the world a little better place um
[43:10] by my own actions and yeah uh very cool
[43:15] and we have an endrine in the podcast
[43:16] where the previous guest is asking a
[43:18] question for the next guest kind of the
[43:20] the blockchain from from guests um and
[43:24] the question for you is an interesting
[43:26] one with touched on it a little bit um
[43:29] what would be the most influential thing
[43:32] that could happen to bitcoin as a
[43:34] positive
[43:36] Catalyst well as a positive Catalyst I
[43:39] think really if more
[43:42] governments are are accepting Bitcoin
[43:46] and if more governments are
[43:48] communicating like uh in a very
[43:51] transparent and open way that they're
[43:53] for example already um accumulating
[43:55] Bitcoin that uh will maybe Implement
[43:58] Bitcoin as a legal
[44:01] tender I really I'm really convinced
[44:03] that this will be like a huge um
[44:06] catalysis to um to improve the adoption
[44:09] and to make it much more faster because
[44:12] right now at the moment we only have um
[44:14] or El El Salvador it's like a Pioneer in
[44:18] in this way but uh I'm totally convinced
[44:22] that it's only a matter of time till
[44:24] other countries other governments uh are
[44:28] opening themselves for Bitcoin and they
[44:30] will communicate it for me it's it's a
[44:33] matter of time it's just a matter of
[44:34] time so um yeah yeah definitely I love
[44:38] it uh before we let you go is there
[44:41] anything uh that you want to speak about
[44:44] is there anything you want to shout out
[44:45] or where's the best way for people to to
[44:48] reach out to
[44:50] you um well I don't want to to talk for
[44:53] example it's uh where it's the best
[44:55] where they can reach out to me I I think
[44:57] um Bitcoin mastery. de it's my it's my
[45:01] um homepage my domain I'm active on on
[45:04] Twitter and on LinkedIn but what I want
[45:07] to shout out or what I want to say uh at
[45:09] the end is um really for maybe for
[45:12] people who are seeing this podcast and
[45:15] um who are still at the beginning I just
[45:18] want to tell um for the people if you
[45:20] don't know Bitcoin or if you're not yet
[45:23] so deep into it just give yourself the
[45:26] chance to to explore it be open and be
[45:30] curious and try to be open and after
[45:34] studying in Bitcoin after some few hours
[45:37] or you can always decide and make your
[45:40] own decisions and say this is nothing
[45:42] for me I don't want to deal with it it's
[45:44] totally fine but uh and this advice I
[45:48] not only want to give regarding Bitcoin
[45:50] because I think it's very important for
[45:53] all aspects and in all areas in our
[45:55] lives to be open to something new
[45:58] because I think if we are not open we
[46:00] are closing so many doors so doesn't
[46:03] matter if it's Bitcoin or something else
[46:05] but yeah always be open stay curious and
[46:09] try to make your own opinion and try to
[46:12] make your own research because this is
[46:14] really important and if a person or if
[46:16] you are able to do this then um you can
[46:20] always make your own opinion and um take
[46:23] further actions
[46:24] so that's excellent the one advice I I
[46:27] love it a lot um so thank you Chris for
