[00:00] it was the thing that made me able to
[00:02] retire at 35 if I started my life in the
[00:06] rat race and the hamster wheel rolling
[00:08] and rolling and rolling I would end up
[00:10] like everyone retiring at 65 retiring
[00:14] for me is not not working anymore is not
[00:17] having to work anymore whenever I input
[00:19] this amount in any retirement calculator
[00:22] it says dude you're okay you're free but
[00:24] in 4 years even the worst predictions
[00:26] are telling us we're going to be
[00:28] somewhere around 500 okay if you don't
[00:30] have you know like volatility to the
[00:32] downside you won't have it to the upside
[00:34] you can retire even if Bitcoin is at 60k
[00:37] 100K or half a million the first thing I
[00:40] did when when I started this plan was I
[00:42] need to be with no debt I need to have
[00:45] no Mortgage in fact I sold my house for
[00:47] Bitcoin in 2020 I'm fine not having a
[00:49] house it was one of the best decisions
[00:51] I've ever made I moved from the city to
[00:54] the middle of the mountainin and legs
[00:56] I'm having much more contact with nature
[00:58] I'm eating health here my life changed
[01:01] from being what I have to do to what I
[01:03] want to
[01:07] do I'm amazed how low the Google Trends
[01:11] and all those those metrics are right
[01:14] now like it we we not we are not that
[01:16] far away from an alltime high uh and
[01:19] there's so much happening but it seems
[01:21] like the retail uh folks and also I
[01:23] don't get any calls like it's it's
[01:25] fascinating it's really calm I feel like
[01:28] well maybe I think it's for us at least
[01:32] that we're in the space for a couple of
[01:34] years right now uh it's a good sign you
[01:37] know like uh I entered Bitcoin just
[01:41] before
[01:43] 2021 and sorry I discovered Bitcoin uh
[01:47] yeah in the last month of
[01:50] 2020 um and I Remember by that time
[01:54] everyone was you like you know very
[01:57] hyped about bitcoin bitcoin's price
[01:59] mainly
[02:00] and I didn't get to see you know like
[02:03] the from nowhere to somewhere I already
[02:07] arrived in the middle of the hype so uh
[02:11] everything right now it's like uh even
[02:14] if it's like been like for years in the
[02:16] space is like you know everything's new
[02:19] because I I this is was my first bare
[02:21] Market it's going this is my first preb
[02:24] market so uh and I think lots of us are
[02:28] somewhere in the same you know moment of
[02:32] our Bitcoin Cycles
[02:35] so I'm really sure they will get trendy
[02:39] again uh we we need to remember also
[02:42] that um by that time uh mainly in the
[02:46] last cycle uh people were at home bored
[02:50] not working all day you know like
[02:52] watching Netflix and Googling and
[02:55] watching YouTube videos so I think
[02:58] that's
[03:00] you know maybe an explanation of why
[03:02] we're a bit lower in Google Trends but
[03:06] still you know like more money than ever
[03:08] is coming in the space
[03:11] so absolutely yeah I think this
[03:13] institutional wave is is now coming like
[03:16] the the really the the company money is
[03:18] coming but today I want to really first
[03:20] off start with you about the topic about
[03:23] retiring and you told me that you set
[03:25] the goal when you were 20 years old to
[03:27] retire with 35 uh and you also achieved
[03:30] that and Bitcoin kind of helped you with
[03:33] that is that right yeah I mean help me
[03:37] would be being a
[03:39] bit uh
[03:41] underestimating it was the thing that
[03:45] made me able to retire at
[03:48] 35 um I've always been a person who had
[03:53] very clear goals you know I wanted
[03:56] something I you know like fight for that
[03:59] something even if it took me years and
[04:01] years
[04:03] and I mean since I finished high school
[04:07] when I was starting my uh University
[04:11] career I started to understand the
[04:14] problem not yet the solution because the
[04:17] solution was you know like a newborn yet
[04:21] so nobody was talking about it I had no
[04:23] idea I didn't actually understand how
[04:27] money work by that time so it was really
[04:31] hard for me to you know like get on this
[04:34] train earlier but I knew that the only
[04:39] way I could uh achieve what I wanted is
[04:44] uh was you know if I could get like 100%
[04:48] of my time at my
[04:50] disposal and I understood that if I you
[04:54] know started my life in the r race and
[04:57] the hamster wheel rolling and rolling
[04:59] and roll in uh I would you know like end
[05:03] up like everyone uh retiring at 65 or I
[05:08] don't know
[05:10] 70 and I knew that that by that time my
[05:15] body and my mental health wouldn't be
[05:18] near as close as you know like what I
[05:21] need them to be in order to enjoy life
[05:25] uh so I mean it's not that I'm a lazy
[05:29] person in fact I'm a very hardworking
[05:31] person I but I knew that I wanted to
[05:35] work on what I wanted and spend my spend
[05:39] my time on on what I wanted
[05:43] and even if I knew I I wouldn't I would
[05:47] be you know like quite W even if I uh
[05:51] you know need money every month income
[05:54] every month uh to keep my standard of
[05:57] living I wanted to be free from the that
[05:59] you know I wanted
[06:01] to I only knew about money that the only
[06:05] problem that money solves is stop
[06:07] thinking about money you know I never
[06:10] wanted you know like uh big private
[06:12] flights and my yachts and you know like
[06:15] big mansions I only wanted to be free
[06:19] you know
[06:20] so as you can guess when I discover big
[06:23] Bitcoin you know like my mind was
[06:25] completely blown out even if I didn't
[06:27] fully understand it at first it took me
[06:29] me like two or three long years reading
[06:33] every book available watching every
[06:36] podcast every YouTube video reading uh
[06:40] you know like uh mises reading Hayek
[06:44] reading you know fredman and all those
[06:49] uh Austrian economic guys who really
[06:53] understood and thought with logic you
[06:55] know I I I could never understood why
[06:58] the world was running the way it was you
[07:01] know like uh math tells us 1+ one is two
[07:06] and the world was telling us it's three
[07:08] or it can be whatever we want you know
[07:10] so I never could uh live that way so I
[07:15] went through the process
[07:18] of understanding uh and even if I didn't
[07:21] study economics or Finance uh I'm from
[07:25] the art Branch I'm a musician but I knew
[07:30] that I was used to some kind of living
[07:34] standard I didn't want to get below that
[07:37] I didn't want to uh you know being on
[07:40] the 25th of the month
[07:44] and I don't know uh not knowing if I'm
[07:47] going to uh be able to P my pay my rent
[07:51] to buy my groceries to afford my medical
[07:54] bills
[07:56] so I thought okay this has to be
[08:00] something uh that Set Me Free from all
[08:03] this and luckily for me uh a few years
[08:08] later I I got introduced to bitcoin um
[08:12] and well once I understood it there's no
[08:16] way I could unsee you know what I have
[08:19] seen and after that all my life has been
[08:24] you know uh used for accumulating as
[08:27] much Bitcoin as I could uh work as hard
[08:30] as ever even if my body uh
[08:34] wasn't letting me do it as hard as I did
[08:38] um I mean just as a background check I
[08:42] studied music and uh I have a degree on
[08:45] classical music
[08:47] composer uh but after that I uh I always
[08:51] always had you know like good skills
[08:54] with uh woodworking on all the stuff and
[08:57] I have a few Tools in my house and I
[09:00] started building
[09:02] guitars
[09:04] and after I think maybe one or two years
[09:08] after making my first guitar without
[09:11] even noticing it was my full-time job so
[09:14] I had to stop playing in gigs and had to
[09:19] stop giving concerts and recording with
[09:21] my bands and producing my studio and I
[09:23] had to end up all day and all night
[09:26] building guitars
[09:28] for uh all over the world luckily so
[09:32] once I understood Bitcoin uh I mean
[09:35] every single penny that came to me went
[09:38] to stack moreat you know H really cool I
[09:42] love a lot that you're building um uh
[09:45] guitars yourself it's a really cool
[09:47] thing but first I want to also um get
[09:51] into like how did Bitcoin actually uh
[09:55] retire you or help you retire that like
[09:57] how was that process of of bit was it
[09:59] just the price appreciation of Bitcoin
[10:02] or was it more than that well I mean
[10:05] once I understood what Bitcoin was I
[10:09] start making my math you know like I
[10:12] said I Want to Be Free by
[10:16] 35 uh and by free I mean retiring for me
[10:20] is not not working anymore is not having
[10:24] to work anymore uh which I finally
[10:28] achieved this year year um so I mean I
[10:32] started like anyone you know like uh I
[10:36] bought my first few sets and after that
[10:39] I set my goals to a few more and then a
[10:41] few more
[10:43] and I always thought
[10:46] okay as everyone does you know like if
[10:49] Bitcoin get gets to this price I will be
[10:52] able to unfortunately we still keep you
[10:56] know like Translating that amount of
[10:58] Bitcoin in US Dollars just to have a
[11:00] reference because I mean the the world
[11:03] didn't wake up yet that we have a a new
[11:06] standard and a new unmovable un molest
[11:10] thing um
[11:13] so in the I think it was like two years
[11:19] ago I've been like two years tacking and
[11:22] I have reached a goal that I mean
[11:26] almost no one around me or no one I knew
[11:30] uh was even close you know but it wasn't
[11:34] enough for me so I put a goal and I said
[11:38] you know like uh I'm going to work two
[11:42] years uh in two years more I'm going to
[11:46] quit wherever I am on my stacking goals
[11:50] but I have to you know like make the
[11:52] biggest effort in my life even if my you
[11:55] know if my back was hurting and my neck
[11:58] was hurting and I was really stressed
[12:00] out because I had a you know like very
[12:03] very stressful job uh I made made that
[12:07] last effort and I reach a goal uh where
[12:12] I said okay whenever I input you know
[12:16] this amount in any retirement calculator
[12:20] in the world it says dude you're okay
[12:23] you're free I didn't want it to believe
[12:25] it at first because you know when when
[12:28] you get that kind of
[12:30] information um you know mainly in in the
[12:34] very short frame time frame uh at first
[12:38] you don't believe it you know you think
[12:40] like there must be something wrong I
[12:43] mean I can't retire
[12:46] 35 there's something I'm missing there's
[12:48] some some input in my Excel sheet where
[12:51] I put a wrong number and well no it
[12:55] didn't so I mean
[12:59] I don't know the future I can't predict
[13:02] any price in the future I know that uh
[13:06] you know even if we stay at this price
[13:09] for four years uh I will be okay so and
[13:14] what people tend to misunderstand when
[13:18] when they're trying to you know
[13:19] calculate the retirement age with
[13:21] Bitcoin is they say for
[13:24] example uh you need let's say $1 million
[13:28] to retire okay so today I need
[13:31] around 14 15 Bitcoins no uh but they're
[13:37] missing to
[13:39] calculate the potential price in the
[13:41] future you know they they are thinking
[13:44] okay today 15 Bitcoins or somewhere
[13:46] around that are $1 million okay
[13:51] but I won't spend that million doar
[13:54] today not tomorrow not in one year not
[13:56] in two and in two years maybe we get to
[13:59] a better Market maybe not who knows but
[14:02] in four years even the worst predictions
[14:07] are telling us even the power LW is
[14:09] telling us we're going to be somewhere
[14:10] around I don't know 500k
[14:15] so even if we don't reach that high
[14:17] numbers in this
[14:19] cycle I need to put like the the lower
[14:23] range of the power low or or the maybe
[14:26] even the structure flow
[14:31] and math Chelsa and Scar City Chelsa
[14:34] that it can't go wrong you know unless
[14:38] something really really really bad
[14:40] happens in the world and in that case
[14:42] Bitcoin won't matter uh money won't
[14:45] matter we only thing that matter will be
[14:48] food and water you know
[14:49] so uh I mean I prepare for every
[14:54] scenario uh I'm prepared for being wrong
[14:58] I don't know if I'm I'm wrong I think
[14:59] I'm not and I know if I am
[15:03] wrong most of the smartest people in the
[15:06] world are wrong too so that gives me
[15:10] quite a bit of comfort and SEC and you
[15:13] know confidence that I'm heading in the
[15:16] right
[15:17] direction
[15:19] um but in case everything goes wrong I
[15:22] mean I could easily go back to work you
[15:25] know retirement is not like a Eternal
[15:28] thing I wish it was and I'm trying it to
[15:32] be but uh if I don't make it uh it's it
[15:37] was just like a good life lesson you
[15:40] know absolutely and you you learned
[15:43] something with that I'm really cool if
[15:45] someone now sits at home and is like
[15:48] okay maybe I also could retire or if I
[15:52] want to work towards retirement at like
[15:55] whatever age like 35 45 50 whatever um I
[15:59] noticed that most of my subscribers are
[16:00] around like 45 to 50 uh so for them it's
[16:04] like okay what if I can retire in like
[16:07] 10 years when I'm 55 or 60 um
[16:11] or even if 65 maybe reti ring better
[16:16] than the average person with Bitcoin how
[16:18] do you look at like that like what what
[16:21] what do you what did you do in the
[16:23] calculations what models did you use
[16:25] what what you also said you prepared for
[16:28] what if I I'm wrong how do did you
[16:30] prepare for that like what are your like
[16:32] worst case scenarios what are your like
[16:35] thinking of like how do you approach it
[16:37] what do I put in like an Excel sheet and
[16:40] how do I even think about that I mean
[16:43] the first thing
[16:45] I I mean it's not advised but I would
[16:48] tell anyone who's trying to escape the r
[16:52] race with Bitcoin is you need to be with
[16:56] an asset that is as SP as as Bitcoin is
[16:59] right now which in my opinion is a very
[17:02] good thing I embrace volatility and I
[17:05] want volatility because if you don't
[17:07] have you know like volatility to the
[17:09] downside you won't have it to the upside
[17:11] either so if we want to go to the Moon
[17:14] we have to be prepared to not you know
[17:17] like going sideways and having bare
[17:19] markets which I think it's totally be
[17:22] acceptable with this kind of you know
[17:25] asset
[17:27] um but the main
[17:29] thing that led me to the idea of
[17:33] retiring is I can
[17:36] adapt I'm easily adaptable with my
[17:39] current situation you know I
[17:43] till last year I lived in a much smaller
[17:46] house with just one bedroom and I lived
[17:51] in the in the middle of the city and uh
[17:57] I mean sorry
[18:01] I need
[18:03] to sorry I live in the middle of the
[18:06] city and I was okay with that you know
[18:10] uh I didn't have a problem with not
[18:12] going on holidays I didn't have a
[18:14] problem with not having a new car every
[18:18] year I mean I could afford it but I knew
[18:23] that if I wanted to be free in the
[18:25] future I needed to make a sacrifice in
[18:28] the present
[18:29] that's what in the Bitcoin standard it's
[18:32] called you know like low time preference
[18:36] so if you can switch from low time
[18:39] preference to High Time
[18:41] preference according to the Bitcoin
[18:43] price of the moment you can retire even
[18:47] if Bitcoin is at 60k 100K or half a
[18:51] million you know cuz for example I'm
[18:54] setting on my spreadsheets you know like
[18:56] numbers when I where I put for example
[19:00] if Bitcoin is at this price at this time
[19:02] of next year I will be able to spend
[19:05] this amount of money okay but there's a
[19:08] minimum amount where I'm comfortable
[19:10] with spending that if I go below that I
[19:14] won't be comfortable you know like uh I
[19:17] don't want to stop being able to pay my
[19:20] private medical insurance I don't want
[19:23] to have to sell my car I don't want to
[19:25] go back and live in the city in a small
[19:27] apartment you know
[19:30] so there's a minimum standard that I
[19:33] want to be or there or above that you
[19:36] know right now where the price is right
[19:39] now it will let me live forever and a 3%
[19:42] withdrawal
[19:44] rate the standard of living I'm leing
[19:48] today everything that comes after that
[19:50] it's a bonus you know I thinking like a
[19:52] like a bonus if I can sell my car and
[19:54] buy a new one or luxury car it's okay I
[19:57] don't care about cars as long as it
[20:00] turns on and takes me to place B from
[20:03] spot a it's okay for me
[20:06] so if you aren't able to adapt to those
[20:11] price
[20:12] fluctuations it would be very hard at
[20:14] least for the
[20:17] next four to six years to
[20:20] retire
[20:22] um but even though if you decide to do
[20:25] it you know there's a base price
[20:29] were you know anything above that it
[20:33] would be okay for you so I'm not
[20:35] planning my retirement like the Trinity
[20:38] study where okay I need to this amount
[20:40] of dollars per month and after that I'm
[20:43] going to spend that exact amount per
[20:46] month uh plus
[20:48] inflation I mean that made sense in the
[20:51] past I think that if you're trying to
[20:54] retire uh with Bitcoin you could think
[20:57] that way but you will have to wait much
[20:59] longer you know if I want 100%
[21:04] certainty I couldn't be able to retire
[21:06] right now but I'm okay with uncertainty
[21:10] I'm okay with spending a bit more next
[21:14] year and being a bit more frugal than
[21:17] year after that you
[21:20] know so as long as I have that base
[21:23] price that for me is x amount I'm okay
[21:29] that is possible for me because of
[21:31] course I don't have
[21:33] children uh my partner she works uh and
[21:37] I mean she has no problem with me you
[21:40] know like taking these risks I
[21:43] understand that some people uh can't
[21:45] afford to take this I wouldn't call it
[21:49] risk this
[21:50] adventure because maybe they're paying
[21:53] uh mortgage maybe they are in debt uh
[21:58] the first thing I did when when I
[22:00] started this plan was I need to be with
[22:03] no debt I need to have no Mortgage in
[22:06] fact I sold my house for Bitcoin in
[22:09] 2020 so I
[22:11] rent now and I don't care I'm fine not
[22:15] having a house and in fact was if I
[22:19] think it um today it was one of the best
[22:22] decisions I've ever made uh I was scared
[22:26] maybe yes uh uh I was advised by
[22:30] everyone not to do it sure yeah I did it
[22:35] anyways hell
[22:38] yeah I love it yeah I think uh
[22:41] financially it's actually right now an
[22:44] amazing decision uh to not have a home
[22:48] but rent a home and instead put that
[22:51] money into Bitcoin I think in 5 10 years
[22:55] you will be looking back at the decision
[22:57] like oh that that was one of the best
[22:58] financial decision I take obviously that
[23:01] I could be wrong here but that's my
[23:04] personal opinion I could also go ahead
[23:07] now I'm 26 I could also go like oh let's
[23:11] build a house let's build some some some
[23:13] Roots but first of all that's not my
[23:15] lifestyle because I don't know if I want
[23:17] to end up in uh being the whole life in
[23:19] Austria Austria is beautiful but maybe I
[23:20] want to move around but second of all I
[23:24] think a house would be a financially
[23:27] devastating decision right now now so I
[23:29] like that you took that R also you told
[23:32] me that you had or have a business uh
[23:36] where you only accepted uh Bitcoin first
[23:39] of all like what what kind of a business
[23:42] and what did you do there was it the
[23:43] guitars that you
[23:45] build uh I think it was since last year
[23:51] or the year yeah last year uh all
[23:55] 2023 uh knowing that I was very very
[23:58] close from you know rearing from that
[24:01] job uh I always had a
[24:06] very cliche phrase that I liked a lot
[24:10] that it's be the change you want to see
[24:12] in the
[24:13] world and I see all the time on the
[24:17] internet even at bit Bitcoin conferences
[24:20] where people talk about Bitcoin and
[24:22] Bitcoin and Bitcoin and when they when
[24:24] the time comes to pay they only accept
[24:27] fear money so so I
[24:30] mean don't don't get people for what
[24:33] they say get them for what they
[24:36] do okay what people do is the truth what
[24:39] people say can be a lie or the truth
[24:43] so I wanted to set an example I wanted
[24:47] to make an unprecedented move because
[24:49] here in
[24:50] Argentina uh I mean I think
[24:55] almost no business yeah I mean I'm
[24:58] almost sure zero businesses here accept
[25:00] Bitcoin as payment method so I started
[25:04] on 2022 accepting Bitcoin and making a
[25:10] big discount by paying with Bitcoin I
[25:13] didn't care about the difference because
[25:14] I I knew I was going to make it much
[25:17] better in in a few months or at most in
[25:21] a year and uh last year I said okay I
[25:26] need to be the change that I want to see
[25:28] in the world I need to set an example I
[25:31] need to you know put my actions where my
[25:35] words are so I started accepting only
[25:40] Bitcoin and you know like after I made
[25:44] that public uh lots of people came after
[25:47] me like hey I only got Fiat or I can
[25:50] wire you or I can send you a check or I
[25:52] can send you usdt or whatever and I was
[25:55] like no only Bitcoin if if not I won't
[25:59] sell it for you and I won't build that
[26:01] castom guitar for
[26:03] you of course I I was in a financial
[26:06] position where I could afford to do that
[26:09] I mean if I had to do that four years uh
[26:14] before that uh I couldn't have you know
[26:18] like that uh you
[26:21] know
[26:23] possibility um but given it it was going
[26:27] to be my last year in in that business
[26:30] at least for now I don't know in the
[26:32] future but at least for now I've been
[26:34] retired for half an year and I said okay
[26:39] I don't know screw it if nobody buys
[26:41] from me anymore I'm okay with that and
[26:44] it's a good way to see how real adoption
[26:48] is going mainly in a country like
[26:51] Argentina that just changed from like a
[26:54] very uh leftwing uh socialist government
[26:59] which is another topic to discuss about
[27:01] uh to a very libertarian uh government
[27:05] and lucky for me uh I got enough orders
[27:11] to fill the full
[27:13] year uh it wasn't easy at first but I
[27:16] knew it wasn't going to be easy so uh
[27:20] yeah I ended up
[27:21] like keeping my word and and taking
[27:24] orders only at Bitcoin knowing it it
[27:27] going to be like
[27:29] my you know big
[27:31] goodbye so at least I could do something
[27:35] for the network you know if you watch or
[27:38] listen to my podcast on a regular basis

[28:52] not least I have something completely
[28:55] new for you guys I partnered up with
[28:58] coin vigilante this is the most
[29:01] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[29:04] saw created by anyone look at that
[29:06] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[29:09] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[29:12] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[29:15] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[29:18] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[29:22] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[29:24] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[29:28] watch collections you have the date of
[29:30] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[29:34] there and of course also the block
[29:36] height and which EPO we are currently in
[29:39] I love the level of detail they put in
[29:42] in this masterpiece and make sure to
[29:45] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[29:47] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[29:50] love those watches so so much that
[29:54] that's amazing I think uh sending the
[29:56] signal that um only accepting Bitcoin uh
[30:01] most won't do it and most cannot afford
[30:04] it to do it also um uh it's it's it's
[30:08] really for example for me it's just not
[30:10] possible because one of the paychecks
[30:12] that I get is from YouTube I I cannot
[30:16] convince them to pay me in Bitcoin I can
[30:18] convince them to not pay no not yet not
[30:21] yet I I hope I can do it but my sponsors
[30:23] pay me not all of them but but some of
[30:25] them pay me in Bitcoin maybe soon all of
[30:28] them uh so like it's it's slowly slowly
[30:31] converting just a um five months ago not
[30:35] one single sponsor paid me in Bitcoin
[30:38] now uh the majority of the sponsors
[30:41] money is in Bitcoin uh and uh maybe I
[30:45] can even switch to uh within the next
[30:48] few months to all the money that I
[30:50] actually get from the sponsors is
[30:52] completely only in Bitcoin I think that
[30:54] would be a a great step also also for me
[30:57] in the business
[30:59] yeah I mean I it would make perfect
[31:01] sense you know given like most of your
[31:04] sponsors are you know biton related
[31:06] products maybe a hardwood wallet or
[31:09] maybe an exchange or I mean if we don't
[31:12] set the example we can't pretend the
[31:15] world to follow us you know so uh as I
[31:19] said before it's easy to speak and to
[31:21] say fancy words and saying yeah
[31:24] bitcoin's going to the moon but for that
[31:27] to happen we need actions and actions
[31:30] are the
[31:31] one thing that lead to another action so
[31:36] I mean now you're having you know part
[31:39] of your paycheck in Fiat and part of
[31:41] your paycheck in Bitcoin and you are
[31:44] probably spending your Fiat and not your
[31:46] Bitcoin and holding till the end so it's
[31:49] like
[31:50] a the problem is when you are alone
[31:55] doing something you know for example I
[31:57] was the only
[31:58] uh business unen I think or as far as I
[32:02] know accepting only Bitcoin and maybe
[32:06] that's strange and that's weird and
[32:08] maybe that's why people didn't hold
[32:10] Bitcoin in the wallets um but as long as
[32:15] enough people do
[32:18] it other people will have to follow
[32:20] through no matter what they like you
[32:22] know so I think someone has to start
[32:28] the revolution it already started but I
[32:31] think we're halfways there and the only
[32:35] way to get to the next level where we
[32:38] start uh changing from you know like
[32:42] store of value to medium of 15 chain to
[32:46] finally end up you know like in unit
[32:48] unit of account is uh by doing these
[32:52] small actions you
[32:54] know absolutely and it's possible
[32:58] uh to to to live on a on a Bitcoin
[33:01] standard and to set that example as much
[33:04] as possible maybe um maybe for someone
[33:08] then it has to be like there's so much
[33:11] accountable things to to do um it's a
[33:14] big burden maybe they can move as slow
[33:16] as but as as much as we can we we should
[33:18] move to uh that um I also want to talk
[33:22] about Argentina and and and and what you
[33:25] hear about that versus what what's maybe
[33:27] going on what we hear online but first
[33:30] one more question on the retirement
[33:32] thing um how long have you been now uh
[33:36] retired and what did you notice of
[33:40] change uh in in you and your behavior
[33:43] and uh in in your interaction with with
[33:45] the
[33:46] world well that's I think ironically one
[33:51] of my favorite questions to be asked uh
[33:55] and it hasn't to do with Bitcoin because
[33:57] because uh Bitcoin starts the change and
[34:01] the one that ends up changing is
[34:04] yourself uh I've been retired for six
[34:08] months right now
[34:11] uh I started having so much free time
[34:16] for myself that I even get pretty bored
[34:21] sometimes uh luckily for me with this
[34:25] whole lifestyle change of retiring I
[34:27] moved from the city to the middle of the
[34:29] mountaines and the lakes so I'm having
[34:32] much more contact with nature I'm eating
[34:36] healthier uh I'm trying to finally move
[34:39] to a carnivore diet with I which I can't
[34:42] yet because the second day I I am off
[34:46] carbs you know like I start like
[34:47] trembling and shaking and cold sweating
[34:50] I think my body is so used to you know
[34:54] like not knowing anything about
[34:56] nutrition uh even though I tried to eat
[34:59] healthy all my life and you know like uh
[35:02] train and do Sports uh I never try you
[35:05] know like full carnivore and it's quite
[35:09] tough man at least for me um I started
[35:15] uh meditating I started taking care of
[35:18] all my back pain and neck pain that I
[35:21] accumulated over the years because of my
[35:24] work uh I started doing uh
[35:28] you know like cold showers ice baths all
[35:32] those things that make you more uh
[35:35] strong resilient I mean strong not in a
[35:37] physical way but strong in a mental way
[35:40] uh I'm much more resilient I'm I stopped
[35:44] having panic attacks I stopped having
[35:49] anxiety uh I mean everything just
[35:54] changed for good for me um
[35:59] I'm still a bit afraid
[36:01] of the amount of free time I have which
[36:05] I shouldn't be really because we are
[36:07] used to and we are educated to be all
[36:10] the time being productive
[36:14] which in some sense I think it's okay to
[36:17] be productive we need to give something
[36:19] back to the world we need to have our
[36:21] time in our lives when we you know like
[36:24] create and live our Legacy but I think
[36:28] that being productive it's so so you
[36:32] know like misunderstood that people work
[36:35] work all their lives just to be able to
[36:38] afford their medical care when they are
[36:42] retired when they were old with the
[36:44] money they saved when they were working
[36:47] hard so it's like a complete irony that
[36:51] I never understood really and I I'm not
[36:55] afraid of being B I'm not afraid of not
[36:59] knowing what to do I'm not afraid of
[37:03] even someday over sleeping or not
[37:06] sleeping at all and I'm not afraid of
[37:10] you know like staying till 3:00 a.m.
[37:12] reading a book or studying or playing
[37:16] guitar because the next day I don't have
[37:18] to go to
[37:20] work so my life changed from being what
[37:24] I have to do to what I want to do
[37:28] and that was for me the most important
[37:30] thing to achieve in
[37:33] life that's beautiful I love it a lot I
[37:37] think it's a it's a great uh great
[37:39] experience and I I mean I love also the
[37:43] mindset that you have that uh you aware
[37:47] that that might even fail and that
[37:50] you're okay with that I think that's
[37:52] something that you really have to do
[37:54] because if you are not okay with that
[37:58] maybe feeling then you cannot really uh
[38:03] have that experience I feel like then
[38:05] you are just like really afraid oh
[38:07] like what what happens when Bitcoin is
[38:09] something not not true like then you
[38:11] live in fear it feels like just
[38:14] accepting that uh uh that you have a
[38:18] plan or you have something that that you
[38:21] you believe in yourself that you still
[38:23] figure it out even if if you are the
[38:25] thing I think that gives you
[38:27] good thing or is it wrong yeah I
[38:32] mean I have a my theory that you only
[38:35] have there only Ex two assets that exist
[38:40] in the world for each of us one is our
[38:44] time and the other one is our head
[38:46] ourselves you know like who we
[38:49] are that's my asset Bitcoin is a way to
[38:53] measure those assets Bitcoin is not the
[38:56] asset Bitcoin is the standard is the
[38:59] ruler that is not flexible it's not
[39:02] elastic it's not you know like Fiat
[39:05] money that's why we can't measure
[39:07] nothing in Fiat money because it's a
[39:10] ruler that keeps changing its distances
[39:13] all the time so once you understand the
[39:16] only two Assets in the world are your
[39:19] time and who you are you
[39:22] won't lose those assets but you can keep
[39:27] the energy of those two Assets in
[39:30] Bitcoin you know so I'm not afraid of
[39:35] being wrong and I'm not afraid
[39:37] of let's say failing because it's not
[39:40] failing if you're trying and you have an
[39:42] idea and a plan and you execute it it's
[39:45] not failing failing is not trying
[39:48] so if I did try and
[39:51] I at least got let's say one two years
[39:55] of free time of being retired 5 years
[39:59] and then I have to go back to
[40:01] work would you call that a fail or would
[40:04] you call that
[40:05] a man he got five free years to enjoy
[40:11] whatever he wants to do in the middle of
[40:13] his life when he's in his you know like
[40:16] physical and mental
[40:18] Peak and if I do have to go back to work
[40:21] I know I'm going to do just as well as I
[40:23] did before because the thing
[40:27] that didn't change when I retire is who
[40:30] I am and what made me succeed and what I
[40:33] was doing is who I am not what I was
[40:37] doing it took me a while to figure that
[40:39] out I mean it's like a much more
[40:43] philosophical you know like uh approach
[40:47] but I ended up you know getting to that
[40:49] conclusion that's why I'm not
[40:51] afraid I love that uh it it's really
[40:57] it's it's not has almost nothing to do
[40:59] with Bitcoin but it has everything to do
[41:01] with Bitcoin I feel like yeah because
[41:04] it's where you measure that energy and
[41:06] who you are you
[41:09] know plus we need to plus we need to be
[41:12] very very very thankful to the universe
[41:15] or to whatever God you believe in
[41:18] because
[41:20] 99.9999% of the people whoever lived in
[41:24] this world and the people who will live
[41:26] in this world will not be able to do
[41:28] what we are able to do
[41:30] now so we are a very very very
[41:35] fortunate micro space in time where we
[41:40] can understand
[41:43] Bitcoin be in the age where you can work
[41:46] to earn dollars to buy Bitcoin I mean
[41:50] people who today are 70 80 90 or dead
[41:55] they didn't know Bitcoin because it
[41:56] wasn't
[41:57] discovered when they were Al people that
[42:00] are not born today won't be able to buy
[42:03] Bitcoin with fat money so we are in this
[42:06] very very very small window and I think
[42:09] it's morally and ethically wrong not to
[42:13] take advantage of that you
[42:15] know absolutely true um maybe a hard
[42:19] topic uh change now but let's talk about
[42:23] Argentina so you live in Argentina um
[42:27] chavier M I think tries to do amazing
[42:31] work to make a free competition between
[42:34] Curren is possible how did you see
[42:37] Argentina uh developing in the past few
[42:41] uh years uh and you also told me that
[42:45] sometimes you think that the
[42:47] representation what you see online on
[42:49] Twitter is not really the the the what
[42:52] what you actually see in Argentina how
[42:54] how is that coming yeah about two T and
[42:58] some tweets we all read I know you read
[43:01] I read and every bit coin reads every
[43:03] day because that's what we do uh I think
[43:09] they're not completely true and when I
[43:12] know for sure that something is not true
[43:15] I'm afraid that everything else
[43:18] is as a lie as the one I know it's a lie
[43:21] you know for example I I read on the
[43:24] main you know like Bitcoin Twitter
[43:26] accounts like like hey Javier mle is
[43:28] talking about you know making Bitcoin
[43:30] legal tender H it's going to be
[43:33] Argentina the next El Salvador it's
[43:35] going to be Argentina the next country I
[43:38] don't know mining Bitcoin and the real
[43:41] truth as harsh as it may sound it's I
[43:46] live here I read the news every day I
[43:48] watch
[43:50] the amount of TV that it's hell you know
[43:54] healthy for for your mind but uh I
[43:58] mean nobody here is talking about
[44:01] Bitcoin as they are you know like in the
[44:04] states or in Europe or you know like
[44:07] some other countries I know people that
[44:10] buy
[44:12] Bitcoin I know fewer
[44:14] people
[44:17] that understands
[44:19] Bitcoin and I know nobody I mean nobody
[44:24] who lives or thinks in a Bitcoin
[44:26] standard you know
[44:27] like whenever I talk to anyone about
[44:29] Bitcoin or when I trying to Orange Bill
[44:32] a friend or you know like a whoever I I
[44:36] start talking about this because I I get
[44:37] very passionate about it which I don't
[44:40] know if it's good or bad you know for
[44:42] the one listening but it's what I am um
[44:46] they always are thinking about just the
[44:49] price and the you know like price
[44:52] movements and uh the the their first
[44:55] question is always like hey hey how you
[44:57] doing with your Bitcoin I heard it it
[45:00] went up you
[45:01] know which I mean I have to be realistic
[45:05] and I know that it's very important
[45:07] because you know like it's the measure
[45:10] against our current unit of
[45:13] account but they don't see Bitcoin as
[45:17] you know like the the new standard that
[45:19] a new paradigm shift they don't see
[45:22] Bitcoin as uh you know they they just
[45:25] talk about you know crypto
[45:27] I don't I don't know if there's a word
[45:29] that I hate more than
[45:31] crypto you know like whenever somebody
[45:33] says crypto I'm like they drive myself
[45:36] crazy and I have to start the
[45:38] conversation about why Bitcoin and not
[45:41] crypto um but they are always thinking
[45:45] of it like a number go up asset which it
[45:50] is but it's not only that you
[45:53] know it's your tool to reach of Freedom
[45:58] it's the only way where you can you know
[46:01] like keep your hard earned time and
[46:04] energy in somewhere nobody can mess up
[46:08] with you know mainly in Argentina where
[46:10] we lived in the last 30 or 40 years to
[46:15] hyperinflations we live through
[46:17] confiscation of assets we live through
[46:19] you know like uh lots and lots and lots
[46:23] of economical crisis where our money our
[46:25] currency is completely dead you know
[46:28] like right now it's stabilizing a bit
[46:31] more but what I and what you and I
[46:37] think uh for Bitcoin against the dollar
[46:40] they
[46:42] think about the dollar against the peso
[46:44] you
[46:45] know most argentinia argentinians their
[46:49] Bitcoin is the dollar because you know
[46:53] like when I got some dollars the third
[46:55] thing I do is exchange them for such
[46:58] when people here earn
[47:00] pesos uh as their you know like income
[47:04] the first thing they do in order not to
[47:06] get you know like liquidated is like
[47:09] they go and buy dollars so we still have
[47:12] that mentality from 50 years ago where
[47:15] the dollar is a stable thing that
[47:17] doesn't Lo lose value over time that it
[47:20] has a reason to exist because it comes
[47:23] from our parents and our grandparents
[47:26] where they have a very conservative way
[47:29] of you know like investing where they
[47:31] were like okay go buy dollars and
[47:33] whenever you have enough money go and
[47:35] buy uh
[47:37] house or as we call it here bricks
[47:40] bricks is like anything related to a
[47:43] building or a construction or an office
[47:46] a house an apartment so Argentinian
[47:49] mindset is still completely and directly
[47:53] uh related to dollars and Bricks dollars
[47:58] and Bricks
[47:59] so I think the newer Generations are
[48:03] start starting to awake just a little
[48:06] bit you know we are not quite still
[48:10] there but I think there's no chance at
[48:12] all that you know like
[48:14] the 50y old generation you know like the
[48:18] ones that today are in power and the
[48:20] Senate and congressman and all our
[48:23] politics um I don't think they
[48:27] understood it enough
[48:29] to uh to make the change unfortunately
[48:33] because I read all these tweets about
[48:36] can be Argentina the next can be
[48:38] Argentina adopt the Bitcoin and whenever
[48:42] I read that as I told you before it
[48:45] scares me
[48:47] that every other tweet I read about you
[48:50] know like uh let's say Gary gansler
[48:52] saying this or Cynthia Lumi about to do
[48:55] that or uh I don't know the European
[48:59] bank it's about to unban or you know
[49:02] like adopt uh Bitcoin friendly
[49:07] regulations I really uh start doubting
[49:10] everything you know because if
[49:12] everything I read about things I know
[49:14] it's not true how can I know if the
[49:17] things I don't know about are true you
[49:20] know that's my M main fear yeah I mean I
[49:25] think there's always a a level
[49:28] of um you have some underlying truth to
[49:32] it and then the internet is blowing that
[49:36] small thing up like
[49:38] crazy uh so this this I think that it's
[49:42] a it's a I don't know if it's a huge
[49:45] problem but it's definitely reality like
[49:47] it's if there is a president like
[49:51] chavier Mal is saying like oh yeah I
[49:53] want to have free competition uh around
[49:57] all currencies then people are like oh
[50:00] Argentina will be the next Bitcoin
[50:01] country that's an extreme like that that
[50:04] that just not true um and if there's
[50:08] like maybe in the EU there's some small
[50:11] regulation coming uh where they are like
[50:14] saying oh we we don't like uh self-
[50:18] custody or it has to be now KC then it's
[50:22] like you is Banning Bitcoin like no it's
[50:25] not so like there's this media thing
[50:28] where it's it's blowing things up uh but
[50:31] that's probably just the um that's just
[50:35] because people really want to have those
[50:37] big headlines and they want to click on
[50:39] those big headlines um and there's
[50:42] always some truths to it and there's
[50:44] always some lies or some uh exaggeration
[50:48] some some some blowing up to
[50:51] that uh and I think like I mean it's
[50:55] true that our president right now is uh
[50:59] trying to force like uh currency
[51:01] competition free currency
[51:03] competition uh which I think it's great
[51:06] because uh if people in Europe and in
[51:10] the states are thinking their money is
[51:14] worthless I invite them to join us for
[51:17] one or two months to really know what to
[51:20] be uh worthless is uh but the good thing
[51:25] about that is that uh every little
[51:29] change that's you know for better for us
[51:34] right now that we're in the bottom of
[51:35] the sea it's like like a v-shaped
[51:41] correction that's you know like if you
[51:43] talk about the microeconomics of the
[51:46] country but the good thing about Bitcoin
[51:48] is I don't know if I can swear in your
[51:51] channel but I don't give a you know uh
[51:55] I'm free I don't my economy doesn't
[51:58] depend anymore on on my country on my
[52:02] you know like uh politics uh decisions
[52:08] uh on nothing you know my economy only
[52:11] depends on how good I keep my SE wordss
[52:16] and my pass phras and that's it you know
[52:18] so when I was saying before being free I
[52:22] really meant free you know like I'm
[52:26] leaving Argentina right now because I
[52:28] want to not because I don't have another
[52:30] option I can go and leave on any other
[52:34] country and I could afford uh you know
[52:36] like um a passport a citizenship or you
[52:40] know
[52:42] but I choose to live here because of all
[52:44] the good things that we have that we do
[52:47] have them even though bad news are
[52:50] always you know like uh they
[52:53] go uh far and good news news they are
[52:57] usually you know uh not that known about
[53:02] but right now I'm living as I told you
[53:05] in the middle of you know the mountains
[53:07] and the lakes and with snow and with the
[53:10] you know in the woods where I can go and
[53:12] take a long walks alone and being in
[53:16] nature and apart from that the cost of
[53:20] living here is so much cheaper than in
[53:24] Europe and in the states I mean I don't
[53:28] know if I could reach out if I live in
[53:32] Europe right now for
[53:33] example but everyone has to make their
[53:36] numbers according to the life they
[53:39] choose right so uh the life I chose is
[53:43] being here which I love where is uh
[53:46] where my family is where my friends are
[53:48] where uh my girlfriend is where you know
[53:51] my whole life is I'm not scared of
[53:53] moving if I have to and one one thing
[53:56] that lets me sleep at night it's that uh
[53:59] if I have to I can take my my 24 words
[54:04] with me so I mean that's real Freedom
[54:08] you know so if they want to ban the
[54:11] dollars fine by me if they want to buy
[54:14] ban Bitcoin fine by me they want to ban
[54:18] free currency exchange fine by me I
[54:21] don't
[54:22] care I transcended all that you know uh
[54:27] human stupidity not because I'm better
[54:30] or or I I reach any kind of Nirvana it's
[54:33] just because I chose to keep my energy
[54:37] and my time and my Assets in Bitcoin
[54:41] that's the only thing and the only
[54:44] reason of why I I just don't
[54:48] care I L it a lot and uh that one hour
[54:52] that we already are now it really flew
[54:55] by really cool uh I liked it a lot um
[54:59] you may might know my end routine I have
[55:02] always two questions uh the one question
[55:03] is always the same uh the one question
[55:06] is what the same is what can we learn
[55:09] from you um besides Bitcoin and I would
[55:13] add with you besides Bitcoin and all the
[55:15] things that we talked about retirements
[55:16] and stuff like that uh what else uh um
[55:20] could we learn from
[55:21] you well uh that's a tough question um
[55:27] I
[55:28] think what I've learned from me that
[55:31] maybe someone else can learn from me is
[55:34] being able
[55:37] to be in the permanent search of
[55:42] becoming a better
[55:44] person uh even when life you know throws
[55:48] stones at you even when your body hurts
[55:53] even when things go to trash you you can
[55:56] still you know be that change you want
[56:00] to see in the world as I said before and
[56:03] you
[56:04] can you know uh put your actions where
[56:08] your mouth is because as I as I already
[56:11] said it's easy to say something it's not
[56:14] that easy to do that something
[56:17] so I think uh yeah
[56:21] that constant try to be a better person
[56:26] and and and trying to leave according to
[56:30] what I
[56:32] say yeah that's really cool I think
[56:34] that's a great learning perfect then
[56:36] let's come to the end routine uh let's
[56:38] see what the previous guest like the end
[56:40] routine of the question uh the podcast
[56:42] is always thought the previous guest is
[56:44] asking a question for the next guest
[56:45] without knowing who the next guest is a
[56:47] very interesting one for you does fixing
[56:50] the money really fix the
[56:54] world yes definitely yes fixing the
[56:57] money it's not what we think it it is
[57:02] fixing the money is not fixing the
[57:04] dollar bills or the Euro bills or how we
[57:07] transact with each other fixing the
[57:10] money is putting a hard cap
[57:15] on how people in power can steal from us
[57:20] and being owners of our true owners of
[57:24] our time and energy so what you do with
[57:28] that time and energy it's up to
[57:30] you but it's but no one no one and no
[57:35] one ever will be you know like uh able
[57:40] to take that away from you if we fix the
[57:43] money so yeah I think fixing the money
[57:47] will not end death will not end poverty
[57:52] will not end uh you know income
[57:55] inequality
[57:59] because those things will exist even on
[58:02] a you know hard money Bitcoin standard
[58:05] because it's a full
[58:07] meritocracy but um yeah but I think
[58:11] if we fix the money we will solve 99% of
[58:16] the problems of the world right
[58:18] now yeah absolutely it's it's sometimes
[58:21] I feel like we can take take it too far
[58:25] because money is not everything but it's
[58:28] massively changing a lot of those things
[58:32] like it it really um is a fundamental of
[58:34] things but we still are humans like
[58:37] humans will still be have the humans
[58:39] problems as as as humans will have uh
[58:42] but yes it's I I do think also that it's
[58:46] fixing a lot of of the things perfect
[58:49] then yeah thank you so much uh Francisco
[58:52] for for being on my show um before I let
[58:55] you go where can people find you ask
