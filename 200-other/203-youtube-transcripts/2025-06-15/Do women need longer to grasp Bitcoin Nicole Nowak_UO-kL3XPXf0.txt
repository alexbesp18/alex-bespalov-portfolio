[00:00] it takes much much more time for women
[00:03] to really practice how to use Bitcoin to
[00:06] actually make their first transaction we
[00:08] have this gender pay Gap day every year
[00:12] and it makes me really angry because the
[00:14] even bigger issue is the gender wealth
[00:17] Gap and if women don't start investing
[00:20] in Bitcoin and then this Gap will
[00:22] increase over time it's weird that we
[00:25] just create money out of nowhere like
[00:27] will not experience this during your
[00:30] your lifetime that women will own 50% of
[00:34] Bitcoin you're full-time in Bitcoin or
[00:36] are you still working something else
[00:38] also yeah that's that's a great question
[00:41] because uh I heard the rumors about
[00:43] myself that I uh quit my my Fiat job and
[00:46] work 100% in Bitcoin that's uh not true
[00:50] uh not yet unfortunately but I'm working
[00:53] hard on it so I made my next step I I
[00:56] told my uh my manager that I will quit
[00:58] this year so uh yeah I'm almost
[01:03] there so you uh are planning to quit you
[01:07] already told your manager that you will
[01:09] quit this year but you did not like take
[01:11] the leap till till now that's that's not
[01:16] why why do you think is the there are
[01:20] the rumors that you already quitted I
[01:22] don't know I don't know how how this
[01:24] happen so people tell me all the time
[01:25] I've heard you you already qu I don't
[01:27] know maybe it's
[01:28] because I don't know I know I I I don't
[01:31] have an answer maybe it's because I I I
[01:33] plan it I talk about it I I was talking
[01:36] about it last year actually so uh maybe
[01:40] that's causing it um but yeah I I'm
[01:43] still uh waiting for a few events to
[01:46] happen but uh I I set a deadline I have
[01:50] to uh to quit I want to do Bitcoin
[01:52] education uh I already do and uh I I
[01:56] just feel I need more time for all the
[01:59] ideas I have for all the projects I W to
[02:02] yeah I want to do in the near
[02:05] future I love it I myself like qued on
[02:08] end of February like still till March
[02:11] since March I'm all in in Bitcoin like
[02:14] this year 2024 this year okay yes Cong
[02:17] year like I I I I get this year like
[02:20] it's now my it's the third month right
[02:23] it's it's March yeah it's third March
[02:26] fulltime in in Bitcoin and it's amazing
[02:28] honestly a lot and December I said to my
[02:32] girlfriend I want to quit next year
[02:35] probably around November December next
[02:37] year but it was then February that I
[02:39] quitted so it came way faster than I
[02:41] thought uh but uh I love that you you
[02:44] took that that that you planning to take
[02:46] this step what inspired you like why why
[02:48] are you doing
[02:50] that yeah so I fell into the riverol um
[02:53] more than 3 years ago and uh yeah it was
[02:58] uh a coincidence of
[03:00] um let's say uh yeah lucky coincidences
[03:05] one after the other um my little brother
[03:07] told me uh yeah let's have a look at at
[03:10] Dogecoin it's pumping could you please
[03:12] invest he was too young back then so I
[03:16] did that for him or yeah I did it
[03:19] instead of him and then I saw okay
[03:21] Bitcoin is kind of pricey what happened
[03:25] what did I miss in the past and uh yeah
[03:29] then I watch a lot of YouTube videos I
[03:31] mean you know the story right and then h
[03:34] two weeks after that I met a colleague
[03:37] uh at my previous employer and he told
[03:39] me to read the Bitcoin standard and that
[03:41] made all the difference it really
[03:44] changed my life because um I studied uh
[03:47] business mathematics so I also took
[03:49] economics courses and like more than 10
[03:53] years ago or so I or around about 10
[03:57] years ago uh when I did I start to it's
[04:00] it's a while ago um I thought okay
[04:03] that's weird that we just create money
[04:06] out of nowhere like helicopter drop and
[04:09] all these terminologies I remember them
[04:12] from my uh macro
[04:14] courses and I wanted to start
[04:16] discussions with my um yeah with my
[04:19] friends at University but they were not
[04:21] so interested so I thought okay maybe
[04:24] I'm just too stupid and understand how
[04:27] how uh a proper system works I don't
[04:30] know and then I did not think about it
[04:32] anymore but when I read the Bitcoin
[04:34] standard many years after after I had
[04:38] these thoughts about money I thought
[04:41] okay I was not that stupid so people are
[04:45] really discussing money and they discuss
[04:49] it from a very different perspective
[04:52] they they say uh things like um our
[04:55] money is broken uh like Lyn Alden is is
[04:59] is uh or named her book uh broken money
[05:02] right and that really changed my life
[05:05] because I thought okay I can maybe maybe
[05:08] I should trust myself more often than
[05:10] trusting others or the system uh this
[05:14] was the first lesson and also I thought
[05:17] okay I I might have a very different
[05:19] future I don't need to be stuck in this
[05:22] hamster wheel so I really felt like
[05:24] being stuck uh I was working um yeah in
[05:29] in in analytics uh for uh different
[05:32] companies also in the um for it
[05:36] consultancy and I felt okay if I get
[05:39] promoted maybe I get more money maybe I
[05:41] get the chance to I don't know afford um
[05:45] um yeah a house or afford um a flat but
[05:49] then I have to work even more I have to
[05:52] uh work at the weekends what I did back
[05:55] then and it was just H the future I I
[05:59] was seeing for myself was really
[06:01] exhausting so with Bitcoin I thought
[06:04] okay maybe I can do something different
[06:07] I didn't know what to do back then but I
[06:10] saw okay there's
[06:11] a yeah there's the chance for a brighter
[06:16] future for myself but also for many many
[06:19] people on this planet and yeah after
[06:23] months and years of studying Bitcoin
[06:26] intensely I I really feel this is is a
[06:31] very
[06:32] very I don't know crucial
[06:35] opportunity
[06:37] and it's it's it's a powerful tool
[06:40] Bitcoin is a powerful tool but we need
[06:42] to use the tool and I want to teach
[06:46] people how to use it and this is what I
[06:48] want to do and hopefully I can do it for
[06:51] a living uh starting this year latest
[06:55] the end of the
[06:56] year I I love it so much and I I
[06:59] interviewed so many people already with
[07:01] with Bitcoin and there are some people
[07:03] that are older some people that are
[07:04] younger in in Bitcoin and they always
[07:07] have like there are two types like there
[07:10] those types that already understood like
[07:11] sound money they're already like kind in
[07:13] a low time preference mindset and then
[07:17] they got to bitcoin and then all of the
[07:18] sudden like it made sense Bitcoin but
[07:20] Bitcoin did not really change their life
[07:22] because they already like kind of in
[07:24] that Austrian economics mindset before
[07:27] rarely but there are people that got a
[07:30] economics and sound money before Bitcoin
[07:33] um but then there are the people that
[07:34] were not in that mindset
[07:36] and those people got their life changed
[07:39] a lot uh with Bitcoin because all of the
[07:42] sudden they asking questions that they
[07:44] did never asked before uh and what I ask
[07:48] myself is are we now just in a really
[07:51] early adopter group and that's why we
[07:53] have so many changes in lives or is
[07:56] Bitcoin actually technology that will uh
[07:58] change the on a broader scale like
[08:01] what's your thoughts on
[08:02] this I mean it's difficult because uh
[08:06] many people they yeah they face
[08:08] different challenges have different
[08:10] mindsets Etc uh but I think it's a
[08:13] letter um I I experienc it myself so uh
[08:17] yeah when I started looking into Bitcoin
[08:20] suddenly everything felt so interesting
[08:24] so I I I really had the impression I was
[08:28] uh looking at a bright star and I wanted
[08:30] to know everything about this and uh
[08:33] Bitcoin is
[08:34] so so multidisiplinary so you you need
[08:38] to look at so so many topics and since I
[08:41] experienced okay um the way I was
[08:45] looking at economics is different now so
[08:49] I thought this was true and now I think
[08:52] this makes more sense and maybe I I I I
[08:57] live in a different truth than before
[08:59] for and uh yeah and you
[09:02] can think about or think in this way in
[09:07] terms of many other subjects for example
[09:10] uh or yeah what what is true what is
[09:13] Truth uh what is reality it's it's yeah
[09:16] you can really um yeah dive deep in
[09:21] these topics and I think if people
[09:24] experience this for the first time and
[09:28] experience okay
[09:31] the world I see it or I saw it it is
[09:34] maybe different then this might um yeah
[09:39] be the first piece of a new puzzle and
[09:42] then you you continue um yeah going this
[09:45] journey and just question
[09:47] everything um yeah and I I and I see it
[09:51] uh with um yeah peers
[09:54] around uh
[09:56] yeah even uh colleagues uh at work I I
[10:00] work for uh a pretty conservative
[10:02] company at the moment at least um four
[10:05] days per week and um of course it's
[10:08] different for everybody but it's WR her
[10:11] orange pill if it makes sense I mean I
[10:14] cannot talk about a bitcon all day long
[10:16] even though I would like to but uh I
[10:19] experienced the same so uh one of my
[10:21] colleagues uh he he read the Bitcoin
[10:23] standard uh because I I I told him it
[10:26] made a difference for me and then after
[10:28] two weeks or so he came back to me and
[10:31] he had also this uh bright eyes looking
[10:34] at me uh like uh yeah his his world
[10:38] seemed to be very different and and I
[10:40] think Bitcoin can be that first piece of
[10:44] a new puzzle this new picture um yeah or
[10:49] this new new pair of glasses uh you can
[10:52] look
[10:53] through it's it's wonderful and I hope
[10:56] that's the case I I always hope that
[10:59] Bitcoin will change a part of society or
[11:02] maybe a major part of society uh there's
[11:05] the possibility that we are just like in
[11:06] an early uh group and then people will
[11:08] just use Bitcoin as as as money H and
[11:12] we'll go on but one thing that will
[11:15] Bitcoin definitely change as I think is
[11:18] the incentives because when we have feat
[11:20] money you have the incentive to spend it
[11:22] faster because it's devaluing at the
[11:25] rapid Pace when you have Bitcoin it's
[11:27] appreciating actually on on on uh on a
[11:30] large scale so you have the incentives
[11:33] to not spend it right now and think of
[11:35] spending twice which lowers your time
[11:38] preference which is confusing for new
[11:40] people but lowering your time preference
[11:42] means that you have a longer time
[11:44] Horizon uh which is I feel like we
[11:47] should change those things lower time
[11:49] preference means a longer time thing uh
[11:52] and it could actually change something
[11:54] in society because incentives are
[11:56] everything uh in today's world in all of
[11:59] the world because who was it Charlie
[12:01] manga was it to say I mean he's not a
[12:03] Bitcoin uh Bitcoin person but Charlie
[12:06] manga said show me your five biggest
[12:08] incentives and I show you what we you
[12:10] will do so when we change with Bitcoin
[12:13] the incentives this will change uh in a
[12:17] fundamental way society as at least I
[12:19] think so um let's go back to the what
[12:23] you did um you said you studied business
[12:26] ma mathematics what actually is that
[12:31] yeah um I think it's different uh at
[12:34] different universities but the way it
[12:36] was um yeah designed uh at the
[12:39] University where I studied was uh in
[12:41] Manheim in uh Germany uh you have
[12:45] mathematics classes it was I think 55%
[12:48] of the uh curriculum and economics
[12:52] classes and business classes and a
[12:54] little bit of computer science so
[12:57] programming basics um and I you have you
[13:01] can choose at least in Manheim it's it's
[13:03] it's the case uh if you would like to go
[13:06] deeper into economics or go deeper into
[13:09] business and I chose economics so I also
[13:12] had a game theory classes and I also
[13:15] wrote my um Master thesis about uh Game
[13:19] Theory actually and I read the um PhD
[13:23] thesis uh of uh John Nash so he's yeah
[13:28] he he he's kind of the father of of Game
[13:31] Theory and actually game theory is a
[13:33] mathematical uh discipline uh many
[13:36] people think it's it's a pure economics
[13:38] but it's actually mathematics and it's
[13:40] used in economics yeah but so this was
[13:45] before Bitcoin
[13:47] right uh yes so so I I was
[13:51] done um in
[13:55] 2015 uh but one of my uh uh peers
[13:59] um she wrote her Bachelor thesis about
[14:02] Bitcoin in 2012 but I didn't take it
[14:05] seriously back then no I I I knew okay
[14:08] Bitcoin exists and it's uh it's it's
[14:11] it's purely uh technical it's uh purely
[14:14] made up working in the internet but uh
[14:17] it's it didn't catch my interest it it
[14:21] my interest was caught by by the Bitcoin
[14:24] standard interesting interesting and
[14:27] when you say the feces was about game
[14:29] Theory uh like what's game theory in
[14:31] general like outside of Bitcoin and
[14:33] maybe then let's dive into like how does
[14:35] this apply to
[14:37] bitcoin yeah so uh like I mentioned game
[14:40] theory is a mathematical discipline so
[14:43] you kind of have um yeah you design a
[14:47] framework um and then you you have uh
[14:51] yeah certain uh agents in this uh
[14:55] framework called players and they
[14:57] interact with each other and There Are
[14:59] Rules uh how they can interact and there
[15:01] are
[15:02] strategies uh that these agents or
[15:05] players uh use and then you can see okay
[15:07] given these circumstances and given
[15:11] these rules what will be the outcome and
[15:14] you could also a design or um yeah a
[15:17] chess for example is a uh could be
[15:19] designed in a game theoretical way you
[15:22] have players player one and player two
[15:25] and you have the strategies and the
[15:27] rules and you can see uh yeah given um
[15:33] maybe a certain strategy uh from player
[15:35] one what is the best um answer of player
[15:39] two yeah and you can uh yeah use these
[15:44] uh models or Frameworks and uh game
[15:48] designs to to answer uh many questions
[15:52] or you can kind of Model Behavior
[15:55] people's behavior uh G given they
[15:59] rational what people of course don't uh
[16:02] at least not
[16:04] always um yeah but that's basically
[16:07] it and then like for for me game theory
[16:10] in Bitcoin is like uh you play all the
[16:14] the the the things that will happen and
[16:16] the natural incentives that people have
[16:18] like you basically bet on people being
[16:21] greedy when you bet on bitcoin and it is
[16:24] like a pretty safe bet uh is that the
[16:27] the game theory around one from Bitcoin
[16:29] or like how do who does how does that
[16:31] apply now yeah so actually um it is
[16:36] extremely beautiful to to to look at
[16:39] Bitcoin from a game theoretical
[16:41] perspective because uh what we have or
[16:46] at least what I experience in let's say
[16:48] everyday life there are conflicts for
[16:52] example
[16:53] [Music]
[16:55] um yeah let's assume uh we have an issue
[16:59] with our climate right and you would
[17:02] like to to to behave in a certain way
[17:05] not to damage your environment but then
[17:09] um you come across conflicts because if
[17:12] a uh if it's uh cheaper to use the plane
[17:15] than the train then one heart maybe
[17:18] beats for using the train and your other
[17:21] heart beats for uh go for the cheaper
[17:24] price right so you have this inner
[17:27] people in yourself figh with each other
[17:29] so what are you going to do who's going
[17:32] to win your inner Economist or uh your
[17:35] inner business person or your I don't
[17:38] know um
[17:40] altruistic uh world uh lovingness I
[17:44] don't know how to how to say and with
[17:47] Bitcoin this is so different because you
[17:50] don't have these conflicts so if you're
[17:52] greedy Bitcoin is fine for you if you
[17:55] love the planet and you would like to
[17:56] change your world I think Bitcoin is
[17:58] fine fine for you if you're a stupid and
[18:00] you forget your keys it's great for
[18:03] everybody like it's it's it's so perfect
[18:06] in terms of incentives it's not causing
[18:09] our inner conflicts and that's why I I
[18:11] love Bitcoin so much and I love working
[18:13] for Bitcoin so
[18:15] much I I I love that explanation from
[18:18] you extremely um
[18:21] that's for for me it's always like the
[18:24] one question before we get into also
[18:26] Fage and and what you Al also doing in
[18:29] in uh Bitcoin um what was like the you
[18:32] said the Bitcoin standard was like
[18:34] really key for you to to understand
[18:36] Bitcoin yeah was there some key concept
[18:38] or some key property or key Moment In
[18:41] the book or something around that we
[18:43] like this this made you click it or was
[18:46] it more gradually then like you get that
[18:49] you didn't get that and the puzzle came
[18:52] together was the something that was like
[18:54] oh this this was really interesting and
[18:56] that's why I'm now like really into
[18:57] Bitcoin
[19:00] um yeah I think the book is uh yeah is
[19:04] really perfect and Brilliant it explains
[19:06] uh the concept pretty well so I I don't
[19:09] know if there's a if there's one key
[19:11] moment uh there were many key moments so
[19:15] first of all the necessity of a scars
[19:19] asset to make money work I was not aware
[19:22] of it and why was it a key moment for me
[19:25] I mean I studied economics I took econom
[19:28] e omics courses and I I uh I also um
[19:33] yeah did well in the exams and still I
[19:35] did not think about it so this was
[19:38] really crazy in my head I thought okay
[19:42] how can this happen you you you you go
[19:44] to university you kind of trust the
[19:47] trust Academia
[19:49] right what how can this be that it's the
[19:53] first time you read this and you did not
[19:55] read it 10 years back then so this was
[19:57] one key moment
[19:59] and uh yeah also saamus uh was
[20:04] explaining why uh all the buildings are
[20:07] so ugly the new ones we we we we uh
[20:12] create right and many years back um you
[20:16] had nice buildings with nice I don't
[20:19] know ornaments around around and uh I
[20:22] was also wondering so all these little
[20:24] questions I had in my mind why are um
[20:29] uh yeah why are why is housing so
[20:32] expensive uh why do we need to work
[20:35] harder why do people need to have uh two
[20:38] jobs or even more like these little uh
[20:41] questions um so this book had nice
[20:44] answers maybe you can criticize the
[20:46] answers I'm also fine with that but this
[20:50] was the first time that um yeah that I
[20:54] was thinking about money and yeah all
[20:57] these little
[20:59] uh stuffs that uh yeah that you had to
[21:02] think about when um yeah when you you
[21:05] look into look into the world and all
[21:08] the issues like housing Etc uh there was
[21:11] an
[21:12] answer with this so fascinating for me
[21:15] that uh like first of all we don't learn
[21:18] about money in the school like when we
[21:21] like 10 12 15 years old or like maybe 16
[21:24] 17 year old it's fascinating that we
[21:27] don't learn about money at all at least
[21:29] I did not in school Nei but then when
[21:32] you go to university and you actually
[21:35] study economics you still don't get the
[21:38] full picture is like why do you know why
[21:42] this
[21:44] is yeah I mean you you could you could
[21:47] argue the system doesn't want us to know
[21:50] and but I think it's it's it's too easy
[21:53] to say the system I mean the system
[21:55] consists of many many people and people
[21:58] who
[21:59] act and make decisions Etc I think it's
[22:02] a really huge blind spot I think
[22:06] teachers aren't aware even if they teach
[22:09] economics uh at school I
[22:12] think maybe PhD students who teach
[22:16] courses at University are not really
[22:18] aware and of course maybe there's a
[22:20] small group of people who don't want
[22:23] people to be aware who are aware
[22:25] themselves but I think it's a small
[22:27] group I think the the bigger issue is
[22:30] that um it's a it's a blind spot and I
[22:34] think in maybe in 100 years uh people
[22:37] will look back look at the way we are
[22:41] using money the dollar and the Euro and
[22:43] they will say how could they be so
[22:47] stupid how could they have why did they
[22:51] accept this money it's it's it's
[22:55] designed uh so badly uh how how could
[22:58] they
[22:59] how could they use it why did they not
[23:01] fight it um I think this will will come
[23:05] I don't know if it's in 100 years or in
[23:07] 200 years but I think this
[23:10] realization will be there in in humanity
[23:13] in h hum um and human DNA one
[23:17] day uh yes I'm also really the believer
[23:21] that my grandkids like I'm now 25 so my
[23:24] grandkids will be born like in a lot of
[23:27] years uh long long time um I think they
[23:31] will ask me why did your generation
[23:36] accept uh money that was printed from
[23:39] the government and why did you accept
[23:42] being stolen from yeah I hope and I
[23:46] think that we will be at that point at
[23:48] some point in the future probably with
[23:50] my grandkids maybe with my grand grand
[23:52] grand kids I don't know uh how how fast
[23:55] this transition goes but we will be at
[23:56] that point we like of course money has
[23:59] to be uh decentralized of of course
[24:02] money has to be scarce of course all
[24:04] those properties of Bitcoin of course
[24:06] money has to be that way it was always
[24:09] that way and we know it from history
[24:10] it's not like that all of the sudden we
[24:12] know the properties of perfect money
[24:15] those were discovered a long time ago we
[24:17] know them not because of now we know
[24:19] them because of a long history so yeah I
[24:23] I hope that that we learn from that and
[24:25] I hope that uh also our education system
[24:28] learns from that which also like uh is
[24:31] an interesting um part how how do you
[24:34] look at the education system when
[24:35] there's more and more YouTube coming up
[24:38] more and more podcasts coming up more
[24:39] and more online courses coming up uh
[24:43] also Michael sailor has some online
[24:45] university where you can listen to MIT
[24:48] uh classes for free um what what does
[24:51] that with with the education system when
[24:53] you basically have everything in like
[24:55] small tablet and you can just like let
[24:58] your kids um learn that way and maybe
[25:01] like make a group I saw it a lot of
[25:04] times where like a neighborhood made uh
[25:07] like a small homeschooling group where
[25:09] like 10 uh kids come to one house and
[25:12] the next time it's another house and
[25:14] they they they make in a more
[25:17] decentralized sense uh the education for
[25:20] their kids which is also like kind of
[25:23] beautiful I think in Austria it's not
[25:24] even possible uh but uh what will like
[25:27] what will tion be like and do you think
[25:30] that you as like a future Bitcoin
[25:32] educator could be like kind of a new
[25:35] school and kind of a new education
[25:37] system that we
[25:38] building yeah I mean I hope so um I have
[25:41] to admit I was usually fine with the
[25:45] education system so I like going to
[25:47] school I like going to kindergarten I
[25:49] liked uh also going to University uh but
[25:53] I I was kind of blind so I
[25:56] trusted um let's
[25:59] say yeah the infrastructure I trusted uh
[26:03] good intentions I I I assumed that
[26:06] people have good intentions Etc and now
[26:09] um I see many many young people suffer
[26:12] they don't want to go to school they
[26:15] don't like the content they learn and I
[26:18] know or I'm I'm convinced that everybody
[26:21] wants to learn and everybody wants to
[26:23] contribute but
[26:25] not but not that way so
[26:28] not sitting in a small room together
[26:33] with I don't know 30 other uh people
[26:36] learning about stuff that is not
[26:39] relevant for their uh future or not
[26:42] relevant for for their everyday life so
[26:47] um I
[26:49] think it's always best if you can follow
[26:52] your interest and our world is becoming
[26:55] more and more complex and of of course
[26:58] you cannot learn everything so uh we
[27:01] should strengthen young people or um
[27:05] children
[27:06] to uh understand their abilities to
[27:11] understand what their interests are and
[27:13] then go for it and then learn in a more
[27:16] Dynamic way I I mean I experience with
[27:19] my uh uh Bitcoin Journey so I was
[27:23] interested in a certain topic and then I
[27:26] was looking for Content then I exch
[27:28] change with people who who were kind of
[27:30] expert in this sub subject and the same
[27:35] should should be the case also with
[27:37] children they have interests so if
[27:40] there's someone interested in I don't
[27:43] know in in computer science topics uh
[27:46] then there should be a way of course in
[27:49] combination with um um yeah the internet
[27:54] and maybe I don't know YouTube videos or
[27:58] or whatever uh there could be many
[28:01] Concepts but but a way a flexible way to
[28:05] meet that the content meets interest and
[28:08] it doesn't make sense to to to have 30
[28:11] children 30 different children with
[28:14] different interests and abilities uh to
[28:17] make them learn the same and then uh put
[28:20] grades on their heads and say you're
[28:22] good and you're not that it does not
[28:24] make any sense not anymore our world is
[28:27] complex and so should be our way to to
[28:30] to learn or at least the the um the
[28:33] tablet of or yeah the plate of
[28:36] opportunities should be much
[28:39] bigger I totally 100% agree with that uh
[28:43] it's it's like putting I mean to some
[28:46] extent it makes sense for every uh human
[28:49] to to learn how to write and stuff like
[28:50] that but uh those like the basics and it
[28:53] should be really fundamental and it
[28:55] should be way more diverse really early
[28:58] on and when does the diversity in school
[29:00] start
[29:01] like like uh
[29:05] never when I think about it like you of
[29:08] course you have certain things where you
[29:09] can go to but it's also like a really
[29:11] fixed Lane it's hard to change that uh
[29:15] once you're in there but yeah let's
[29:17] let's let's come to what you wanted to
[29:19] say something yeah it's very limited so
[29:22] of course you can choose at least in
[29:24] Germany between do you want to go more
[29:25] into the science direction or language
[29:27] Direction but then you're you're again
[29:29] limited uh in your
[29:31] choices yeah yeah definitely this the
[29:35] The Limited option makes it
[29:37] uh it's just a really uh constrained
[29:40] system uh which doesn't uh leave a lot
[29:44] of room for creativity and and uh
[29:47] expansion yeah um let's come to what you
[29:49] are also doing in in in Bitcoin you are
[29:52] in Les farm orang and Terra has as as I
[29:55] saw it um I love the the concept of Les
[29:59] f marage um maybe and I want to make it
[30:02] a little bit more known I think like in
[30:04] Germany in Austria is really well known
[30:07] um when I speak with with people from
[30:09] from all over the world
[30:12] they sometimes don't know it sometimes
[30:14] actually know it um what is the concept
[30:16] behind it and and why it's important
[30:19] yeah so Le is basically um yeah founded
[30:24] by a small group of women um and the
[30:27] idea was was given by by Rachel Rachel
[30:29] Gia she's she has um English Roots uh
[30:34] but she's actually a living in Germany
[30:36] at the moment so she's also um yeah yeah
[30:41] bringing lean zange International in
[30:44] yeah International context U we also
[30:46] have a a get together uh in Prague
[30:50] actually on uh Thursday before the
[30:52] conference so if anybody's interested uh
[30:55] feel free to ping me or to Ping Rachel
[30:58] um yeah so the idea is or let's say the
[31:03] the reason why leam exists is because uh
[31:07] we uh from the the point of view uh from
[31:11] a women's perspective found that the
[31:14] Bitcoin space is super great there are
[31:16] many many brilliant people but why are
[31:20] there yeah not so many women we're we
[31:23] miss more women I would like to have
[31:26] more women going to conference
[31:28] conferences uh meetups and also more
[31:31] women creating um I don't know inventing
[31:34] projects or a start building a business
[31:37] on top of of Bitcoin and that's not the
[31:40] case so we ask ourselves why is that the
[31:42] case and uh we found or from our
[31:46] experience um it's because of two things
[31:49] uh Bitcoin is related to Tac and Bitcoin
[31:52] is related to finance and these two
[31:55] topics are in general of course there
[31:58] are exceptions uh in general not so
[32:01] interesting for women or at least I
[32:03] experience it it work I experience it um
[32:08] among friends uh women tend to say oh
[32:11] it's I don't know stocks that's not
[32:14] interesting for me I don't understand it
[32:15] it's not for me and so the conclusion is
[32:19] the same uh with Bitcoin and we try to
[32:23] build an offer for
[32:25] women to yeah to start
[32:29] educating themselves or with other women
[32:33] um that comes from a different
[32:35] perspective so we we want
[32:38] to yeah teach or we want to
[32:43] make yeah we want to explain that
[32:46] Bitcoin is important for society so we
[32:49] answer questions or start answering the
[32:52] question why is Bitcoin important for
[32:54] you for your family for for society as a
[32:57] whole
[32:58] but also next to education we want to
[33:02] offer to let everybody experience bitco
[33:06] themselves so most of the
[33:08] time or many times women are scared that
[33:12] they don't understand it that it's too
[33:14] difficult that it's too
[33:17] tag yeah and they they they're not made
[33:21] for this and we want to show them if you
[33:23] are able to to use a computer you are
[33:26] able to own Bitcoin you are able to um
[33:30] yeah to to to use a hardware wallet and
[33:35] um it's it's I think it's easier for
[33:38] women to learn from women or it can be
[33:42] easier
[33:43] because I think we use a different
[33:45] language we we look at things from a
[33:48] different perspective and I I don't want
[33:50] to generalize too much but um yeah I
[33:53] think for a certain group of women this
[33:55] is um maybe the way to go and to to to
[33:59] to understand and to feel that Bitcoin
[34:03] is important and can change their
[34:06] lives 100% and and and for me it's like
[34:10] um I know my statistics like I when when
[34:14] I kind of started out I had like 4% of
[34:16] female listeners of my podcast I worked
[34:19] my way up to 7% now
[34:23] so I'm getting more uh but uh then you
[34:27] can say oh okay okay yes it's a a male
[34:29] host it's it's like uh most speakers are
[34:31] male I'm trying to fix that but uh M
[34:35] male speakers are just easier to find
[34:37] than than female speakers but then even
[34:40] uh Natalie prunell who's the one of the
[34:43] biggest podcasters ever and I think the
[34:46] biggest one especially for as a female
[34:49] host um she shared this uh uh statistics
[34:53] and she also only had 20% of female uh
[34:56] listeners so like there's definitely uh
[34:59] a big gap like a big uh um difference I
[35:03] mean you just have to go to you
[35:05] mentioned Bitcoin Prague by the way get
[35:07] your tickets in Bitcoin prag it's so
[35:09] important to meet other bitcoiners in
[35:10] real life and there will be many women
[35:13] at least from Germany because uh I know
[35:16] that many uh Li visitors or uh yeah uh
[35:21] women uh joining our meetups and also
[35:25] our event and summer they will come to
[35:28] to Prague and they also gathered uh or
[35:31] um yeah exchanged uh ideas where I don't
[35:35] know which hotel to book or uh where to
[35:38] meet Etc so I think it's it's also great
[35:41] for for women especially going to prog
[35:43] this year if you are listening to this
[35:46] podcast you might be wondering what is
[35:48] actually the setup look like of Robin or
[35:50] how can I improve my Bitcoin setup and
[35:53] there's two things you have to buy
[35:55] Bitcoin from the right source and you
[35:56] have to store Bitcoin the right way
[35:59] let's focus on the first thing how to
[36:01] buy Bitcoin it's simple have a Bitcoin
[36:03] only exchange don't deal with the
[36:05] shitcoin exchanges don't deal with an
[36:07] exchange that has an own token or
[36:09] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[36:11] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[36:14] for me the best partner for that and now
[36:18] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[36:20] should be stored on a hard your wallet
[36:22] on a self custody solution where you
[36:25] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[36:28] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[36:31] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[36:34] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[36:36] phas and you are better than 95% of all
[36:40] Bitcoin hodlers if you have more than a,
[36:43] Euros in Bitcoin it's an absolutely must
[36:46] have one last thing before we get back
[36:48] to the video I'm really passionate about
[36:50] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[36:52] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[36:55] in June the Bitcoin br conference it's
[36:58] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[37:01] conference in whole of Europe for all
[37:03] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[37:06] this place in June for all europs it's a
[37:08] must go anyways you're so close to the
[37:11] Bitcoin PR conference you basically have
[37:13] to come I will do interviews there and I
[37:16] would love to meet you all there use
[37:19] code Robin for all my sponsors to get
[37:21] discounts and use the links down in the
[37:24] description yeah it's always like
[37:26] meeting other Bitcoin is in real life is
[37:28] a game changer uh it's it's last year
[37:32] Bitcoin spr conference is why I am uh
[37:36] here right now this gave me the energy
[37:38] and gave me the momentum for me
[37:41] personally to like okay that's it like I
[37:43] love Bitcoin and I want to work in this
[37:46] field because I was not working last
[37:47] time this year last time at this uh last
[37:51] year at this time in Bitcoin uh but I am
[37:55] now and I'm I'm I'm super
[37:58] glad that this conference is there
[37:59] because it gives you a lot of energy
[38:01] like I can encourage just everybody go
[38:03] there come say hi to Nico come say hi to
[38:06] me uh and and let's talk there I'm
[38:10] 100 I'm looking forward to to that event
[38:12] a lot um one question on on that topic
[38:16] uh is did you had any thoughts of going
[38:21] into the Bitcoin uh industry because it
[38:24] was like did you had any challenges
[38:26] where like oh maybe should not go in
[38:28] there because it was so male dominated
[38:30] is is there anything that you like um
[38:32] you were first not Andre or was was Les
[38:35] less Fage helping you in that regard or
[38:37] like how did this how did this go no
[38:40] actually my first uh Bitcoin conference
[38:42] was uh the one in insbrook in
[38:47] 20
[38:50] 22 Yeah
[38:52] so more than two years ago no more than
[38:56] one year ago
[38:58] I don't know so so much happened uh in
[39:00] the past three years um yeah and I went
[39:04] there all by myself so there was nobody
[39:07] from my friends or group of friends
[39:09] nobody wanted to join me uh neither
[39:12] women nor men so I went there all by
[39:15] myself but I thought okay uh
[39:18] yeah no matter what I will I will um
[39:22] probably uh experience many great things
[39:26] and it was like that and I mean
[39:28] bitcoiners are really open open-minded
[39:31] and also open to meet new people so it
[39:33] didn't take too too long to to get in
[39:36] touch with people to talk to exchange
[39:39] ideas uh Etc it was an amazing
[39:43] conference um so for me it was not the
[39:45] case but uh I mean I'm used to to be in
[39:48] male
[39:49] dominated context so studying
[39:53] mathematics implies uh studying with a
[39:56] lot of males um working for an it
[39:59] consultancy implies working with a lot
[40:01] of males um so for me it was actually
[40:04] not not an issue but it was an issue for
[40:07] me to convince other women to to follow
[40:13] me or to uh to find Bitcoin interesting
[40:17] so uh that was the bigger challenge or
[40:19] also to
[40:21] explain uh to my mother why I do all
[40:24] this she she didn't understand why I
[40:26] would take all my my vacation days to go
[40:28] to bitcoin
[40:30] conferences so that was that that was my
[40:33] Challenge and this also um yeah made me
[40:36] uh uh start my own podcast um yeah it's
[40:41] it's a German speaking uh podcast but
[40:44] what I do there is I explain in very
[40:46] short episodes every episode is only 21
[40:49] minutes I explain Bitcoin without using
[40:53] English words if if possible um I'm
[40:57] using uh simple words um and I I I I
[41:02] take one topic and then focus on this
[41:05] topic and try to to make it as easy to
[41:09] follow as possible and since my mom is
[41:12] uh listening to this podcast she she
[41:15] finally understands why I'm so excited
[41:19] um yeah why why Bitcoin makes me uh yeah
[41:24] feel so so positive why it makes me uh
[41:27] look uh into the future in a positive
[41:31] way Etc and I think we just need more
[41:34] women
[41:35] to yeah to attract more females and uh
[41:40] yeah that's why why I'm um I'm
[41:42] passionate about Liam but personally I I
[41:45] would also be fine uh or I was fine uh
[41:48] going to to to a Bitcoin conference
[41:51] where uh yeah there's there are many
[41:55] many more um guys than women
[42:00] yeah yeah and it's it's I think it's
[42:03] just natural because Bitcoin will be
[42:05] owned by everybody anyways so uh at one
[42:09] point it will be like
[42:11] 50/50% yeah I don't know I had I had
[42:14] this discussion with uh others
[42:17] especially with
[42:18] males and many say forget about it 50/50
[42:23] uh no wealth is not distributed in that
[42:25] way and you will not
[42:27] experience this during your lifetime
[42:30] that women will own 50% of Bitcoin and
[42:35] uh probably from a rational point of
[42:37] view this is true but still uh this does
[42:41] not stop me from um trying to work on
[42:44] this issue uh we have this gender pay
[42:48] Gap day every year and it makes me
[42:50] really angry because the the even bigger
[42:54] issue is the gender wealth Gap and if
[42:58] women don't start investing in Bitcoin
[43:01] or buy Bitcoin Hollow Bitcoin uh then
[43:04] this Gap will increase over time because
[43:07] we know uh Bitcoin is uh growing um
[43:11] exponentially yeah and this makes me uh
[43:14] kind of angry and motivates me to to
[43:18] continue yeah it could be a a big
[43:21] problem actually um what I meant is
[43:24] because everybody will own it like uh
[43:27] not not the the wealth of the the
[43:29] peoples uh but the Bitcoin will be
[43:32] distributed with everyone but they will
[43:34] have uh different amounts of Bitcoin
[43:37] definitely was also interesting that
[43:39] came up in one of my podcasts because I
[43:41] always say like adoption rate is so good
[43:43] in in the uh in in the third world
[43:47] countries with like Nigeria El Salvador
[43:49] like the the Western world is kind of
[43:51] arrogant to bitcoin uh and don't
[43:54] understand it um but then I got a
[43:55] comment on my YouTube Channel we like
[43:58] but I guess most Bitcoin are still owned
[44:01] by the Western world like the adoption
[44:03] rate is probably higher in Nigeria but
[44:05] most of the Bitcoin are actually
[44:07] probably in the in the western world
[44:08] because the purchasing power is just so
[44:10] much uh bigger which is an interesting
[44:13] thought um but yeah it's it's it's
[44:16] interesting um because when you have now
[44:19] this this whatever it is like maybe it's
[44:21] like 10% females and 90% males in in the
[44:25] in the Bitcoins fee I don't know what
[44:26] the exactly the the rate is maybe it's
[44:29] like 8020 maybe it's like
[44:31] 955 um and then you extrapolate that out
[44:34] in the future when everybody wants have
[44:37] Bitcoin and everybody has Bitcoin and
[44:38] every everything is uh made with Bitcoin
[44:43] then uh this wealth Gap could actually
[44:45] increase a lot as you said like it could
[44:47] be a big problem it is for every uh uh
[44:51] woman watching this now this should be
[44:53] like the biggest motivation to go to all
[44:56] your uh female friends and say hey we we
[44:58] need to to buy
[45:00] Bitcoin like wealth gate we can go on
[45:02] the streets and and demonstrate with
[45:05] because of uh uh that we don't get paid
[45:08] that much but most effective thing like
[45:10] buy a lot of Bitcoin then you you get
[45:12] ahead also and also one interesting uh
[45:15] fact we experience from our Le
[45:19] meetups um we experience that especially
[45:24] women that are a bit older
[45:27] they tend to be interested much more
[45:29] than young women because they see an
[45:32] issue for their own lives they look at
[45:35] their um what is it called
[45:37] rent so they retire in a few years maybe
[45:41] in 10 years or maybe 15 years and then
[45:44] they already know okay I will have an
[45:46] issue when I'm old when I retire so I
[45:49] need to do something so there's a
[45:51] problem that these women see and they
[45:54] want to solve it and Bitcoin is for them
[45:57] uh one solution or can be a solution and
[46:01] um since that's at least that's my
[46:04] experience young women have different
[46:07] types of problems and they don't look at
[46:09] the future when they retire but they
[46:11] look at I don't know maybe growing a
[46:13] family or something or I don't know uh
[46:15] buying um a house or I don't know uh
[46:19] plan big trips vacation don't know it's
[46:22] just different a different perspective
[46:25] and um and not so interesting for them
[46:29] unfortunately I I wish we had many more
[46:33] uh younger women also um joining leam I
[46:37] mean there are a few yes uh but I wish
[46:42] um more young women would think about
[46:44] Bitcoin um read one book watch YouTube
[46:48] videos uh content whatever um yeah much
[46:54] more what I also I mean this is
[46:57] 100% my subjective uh experience and and
[47:01] no studies involved here um what I found
[47:04] is women are more risk at wor like they
[47:06] are usually more um conservative and
[47:11] they don't want uh the risk associated
[47:14] with Bitcoin which we know that there is
[47:16] not uh but the mainstream media is is
[47:20] picturing Bitcoin as this big risky
[47:24] speculating thing uh and this is what
[47:27] most people think of Bitcoin and what I
[47:30] found is most of my male friends are
[47:33] okay with that and most of my female
[47:36] friends are not they are conservative
[47:38] they they don't they they they are
[47:41] collectors they like they don't want to
[47:44] have this risk of something speculating
[47:46] and this is just like my my personal
[47:48] experience when I walked up to a male
[47:51] friend of mine and do hey Bitcoin and
[47:53] they're like oh okay let's try it and
[47:55] with females they they have way more
[47:57] questions uh they're way more uh
[48:00] cautious when it comes to the topic uh
[48:01] this is just purely on on my uh
[48:04] subjective experience but uh is is is
[48:07] that something that you also think is is
[48:09] is true or is that something that could
[48:11] be the topic yes we experience it uh
[48:14] yeah in our workshops so we also teach
[48:18] hands on how to uh set up um a hardware
[48:22] wet for example and then of course we
[48:25] get into discussion with with uh women
[48:27] Etc and we find that it takes much much
[48:31] more time for women to really uh yeah to
[48:37] to to Really practice how to use Bitcoin
[48:41] to actually make their first transaction
[48:44] so the need for information before doing
[48:47] so is much higher in in our personal
[48:50] subjective experience um also no no
[48:53] statistics involved here um and for man
[48:57] it's like okay let's try then Bitcoin
[48:59] yeah okay how how can I where can I buy
[49:02] it okay I just do it what is it a
[49:03] hardware wallet okay how how can I set
[49:05] up I watch a YouTube video okay I I do
[49:07] it easy for for women it's more like
[49:11] what could happen like the risk aversion
[49:14] and then it takes just much more time
[49:17] but we also
[49:18] find um if you learn from each other if
[49:22] you learn from other women if you see
[49:24] okay she's a woman she can do it I can
[49:26] do it as well so um it's it's easier if
[49:29] you have a role models uh also female
[49:32] role models showing them it's easy you
[49:34] can do it you can run a computer you can
[49:36] use a computer you can use a hard
[49:41] wallet that's
[49:43] why 100% yeah 100% And I that's that's
[49:48] one reason why I also try to give uh
[49:51] every woman that I find in the Bitcoin
[49:53] space uh a stage here I mean I try to
[49:56] give every BL that wants to talk about
[49:58] Bitcoin a stage on the podcast because I
[50:01] think like there are so many great
[50:02] stories around Bitcoin uh and yeah like
[50:05] just like putting uh people on top of a
[50:08] stage and this is even a broader broader
[50:11] thing
[50:13] because maybe sometimes people don't
[50:16] recognize or don't have um Michael is
[50:20] not good for some portion of of
[50:22] bitcoiners maybe cerini MO is not the
[50:25] best person for some uh bitcoiners so
[50:28] that's why we need to have a lot of
[50:30] different speakers uh to speak about
[50:33] Bitcoin on on big stages uh and uh I I
[50:38] have seen when I see in my YouTube feed
[50:41] and when I see my overall feeds I mostly
[50:44] listen to other men like for twice for
[50:47] stuff like that uh and I probably uh
[50:51] with with most of the females is
[50:52] probably also like when they lose try to
[50:55] as you said before when they I want to
[50:57] get to know about Bitcoin they are
[51:00] tending to first look at other woman
[51:02] what are they saying about it and so
[51:05] when we get to a stage where there are
[51:07] more um women involved in the stages and
[51:10] speakers and stuff like that and we're
[51:12] trying to go do a good job here then we
[51:14] have like a better chance in like
[51:16] evening that out because then they not
[51:19] did it but yeah when you look at my
[51:21] YouTube then you look scroll down it's
[51:24] like woman Wom but it is like that so I
[51:28] I I try to keep it uh fresh but it's
[51:31] it's not that easy like the speakers are
[51:33] definitely more on the on the male side
[51:36] but I'm trying to do my best in in
[51:39] giving more and more females a stage
[51:41] yeah thank you very much for this uh
[51:43] also from um our um impression or our
[51:48] impression is that mostly for example
[51:50] conferences are built by man and I mean
[51:54] that's that's then not
[51:57] natural let's say evolvement then that
[52:01] also the topics that are visible on
[52:05] stage Etc are or tend to be bit more
[52:10] interesting for men and I I would love
[52:14] that uh yeah women and men team up and
[52:18] exchange ideas and yeah try to to also
[52:24] put topics on stage that are more um
[52:27] attractive for women and just have a
[52:29] women in the team when designing
[52:31] conference uh might help here so this
[52:34] will be my um yeah my wish for future
[52:38] conferences is there Les conference in
[52:42] Bland that would be I think awesome oh
[52:45] uh I mean we have a lot of plans for the
[52:49] future uh time is is just an issue um
[52:54] but we have an event uh in Germany
[52:56] uh the Bitcoin Hotel uh close to
[52:59] stutgart end of July so if you're uh if
[53:04] you're around and if you know a little
[53:07] bit of German then then you're of course
[53:10] uh warmly invited and let's see what the
[53:13] future brings uh so um when I when I
[53:17] quit my Fiat job there's much more room
[53:19] for um yeah for Bitcoin education also
[53:23] much more room for Le fs orang and uh
[53:26] really excited about next year um I mean
[53:29] of course Bitcoin is not only about the
[53:31] price but um attraction comes with
[53:34] higher prices and um yeah I just hope
[53:38] that we can just yeah use the moment and
[53:42] uh yeah try to to make it bigger try to
[53:46] um reach many more women especially of
[53:49] course uh men are also um invited by the
[53:53] way we don't uh we don't close doors for
[53:56] for men it's just we we just make it
[53:58] more women
[53:59] friendly um yeah so maybe there will be
[54:03] a Le
[54:05] conference in the
[54:06] future and that's a big thing honestly
[54:09] because um that the last
[54:12] f i i still still cannot pronounce it
[54:16] even though I said it so many times uh
[54:19] that it's not closed only for women is a
[54:22] big thing and uh I don't know who who uh
[54:26] was was a big support of that inside of
[54:28] the team but it's a really great thing
[54:31] to do because when you close it down uh
[54:34] then it's like this this fear kind of uh
[54:38] woman empowerment you're like oh we have
[54:40] to keep them in the thing but I feel
[54:43] like that the fact that it's open makes
[54:45] it 20 times better because then it's
[54:49] actually like we want to give them a
[54:51] female friendly environment and don't
[54:53] want to separate these things like this
[54:55] is kind of like the thinking like we are
[54:57] separating stuff but that's yeah that's
[54:59] just my opinion yeah it was actually
[55:02] Lena Lena sa the mother of the little
[55:04] hodler uh she was also involved in our
[55:07] debut event uh end of when was it
[55:12] 2023 uh when we had our uh first first
[55:16] event uh or no J January 2023 oh I just
[55:21] mixing up uh uh times but uh yeah we had
[55:25] the discussion because there are pros
[55:27] and cons and there are really women um
[55:30] asking for women only events I mean they
[55:33] they are there um but we we now gained
[55:37] more experience we uh gathered feedback
[55:40] from females Etc and we found that uh
[55:45] sometimes it's the other way around
[55:47] there are females and um they want
[55:51] to to get their husbands involved or
[55:55] their sons and uh they they like the
[55:57] opportunity to to take to to bring them
[56:01] uh to meet up or to bring them uh to our
[56:04] um weekend events yeah and we found that
[56:08] uh it really uh yeah it's it's just the
[56:10] market decides uh we had have the
[56:12] impression that we also attract
[56:14] different types of men it's it's the
[56:17] more I know it's cliche and it's uh
[56:20] there are exceptions but it's more the
[56:23] maybe the more introverts uh type of a
[56:26] guy who um yeah just likes to have a
[56:30] more let's say calm environment because
[56:34] uh you know yourself there are also uh
[56:37] meetups and conferences uh um yeah
[56:41] mainly run by by men and then there's
[56:43] also sometimes uh a hidden fight who who
[56:47] um yeah who explains it best who knows
[56:50] the best like you know this uh I mean
[56:55] there's nothing bad about it but uh I
[56:57] think there are people who like to have
[56:59] it a bit more I don't know the community
[57:02] like the everybody should feel uh fine
[57:04] it's not
[57:05] about um yeah about explaining it the
[57:09] best or being the best or knowing it
[57:12] best it's just uh yeah it's
[57:16] just yeah it's just a community so the
[57:19] the growing together like this kind of
[57:22] atmosphere and you have it more a bit
[57:24] more at least we feel it um during our
[57:28] events uh it it's
[57:31] more yeah being together learning from
[57:34] each other it's really a really nice um
[57:39] yeah
[57:41] environment yes it's it's definitely
[57:44] true and um even though uh in in the
[57:47] Bitcoin Community it's
[57:49] actually way better than in most other
[57:52] uh I was I was in it security and I was
[57:55] in other fields
[57:56] um there it's like 10x from from that
[58:00] even even if you're in a um I was at the
[58:04] privacy and security event uh in in also
[58:07] in the Bitcoin hotel in Blan uh in uh
[58:10] and there was a really high uh
[58:13] percentage of of men because it's
[58:16] Bitcoin and then it's the special topic
[58:17] of privacy and security um and even
[58:20] there like it's it's a it's a nice
[58:22] environment still it's a kind a friendly
[58:24] environment but I know exactly what you
[58:26] mean but uh the the the contrast then to
[58:30] other communities and to other fields
[58:33] that I experienced outside of Bitcoin is
[58:35] then even 10x 20x different uh and it's
[58:39] it's interesting and I feel like uh in a
[58:43] way Bitcoin is like this humbling thing
[58:45] where the ego is less there where like
[58:48] you you have to learn like when you have
[58:51] big characters that got a little little
[58:54] bit overshot ego like when we talk about
[58:57] Roger V who was really good in the
[59:00] Bitcoin Community but at some point he
[59:02] drifted off and it was probably an ego
[59:04] thing that got him on on the wrong track
[59:08] it can humbles you because who who now
[59:11] listens to him nobody and when uh no no
[59:16] it does not matter who how big he is and
[59:20] whatever he's saying if he's saying
[59:22] something wrong on he's on a ego trip
[59:25] the Bitcoin
[59:26] Community uh will cancel him but they
[59:30] they will uh they will humble him the
[59:32] Bitcoin itself will humble him uh
[59:35] because uh it's the first thing that
[59:37] does not work like everything else
[59:39] there's no hierarchy in Bitcoin it's
[59:41] just like Bitcoin is its own thing of
[59:44] course in Bitcoin there are speakers
[59:45] that are more well known and they have
[59:47] probably more influence in the community
[59:49] that's definitely a thing but there's no
[59:51] hierarchy in Bitcoin and that's a that's
[59:53] a beautiful thing and but I definitely
[59:55] know what you mean
[59:56] uh and and I I love how you also
[59:59] explained it
[60:01] um what else before we get to the end
[60:05] routine because you're already at the
[60:06] one hour Market it flew by really
[60:09] quickly what else are you doing in
[60:11] Bitcoin in the Bitcoin Community I think
[60:13] Terra space is also something uh what
[60:16] else are you doing yeah so Terra has is
[60:19] a I would say in the German speaking
[60:21] space a well-known company focusing on
[60:24] bitcoin and energy um um yeah uh yeah
[60:29] researching how um Bitcoin mining could
[60:33] also
[60:34] helping um in the European Union for
[60:37] example um to change the way energy is
[60:41] or um yeah electricity is generated so
[60:46] uh this is uh yeah one thing there I'm a
[60:49] representative and this means that um
[60:52] yeah I help the team uh whenever it's
[60:55] needed for example going to um
[60:57] conferences explaining uh Bitcoin to
[61:00] others so last year for example I went
[61:02] to the uh famous invest Trade Fair um
[61:07] and there we were kind of the Bitcoin
[61:10] Advocates yeah and besides that I'm also
[61:12] a mentor and a speaker for Bitcoin
[61:15] talents it's an International Education
[61:18] Program run by the Frankfurt School of
[61:20] Finance it's a private university in
[61:23] Germany and the program is for free it's
[61:26] a kind of mentoring program it's um it
[61:30] it lasts 18 weeks and every second week
[61:34] uh you
[61:35] exchange uh what you learned last time
[61:39] um with your peers and there's also um
[61:42] uh one guest speaker every time so this
[61:44] is also uh what I do
[61:48] um yeah and I think that's it and maybe
[61:50] there are many more projects to come
[61:53] currently most of the the the biggest
[61:56] part of my of the time in the Bitcoin
[61:58] space I use it for the podcast because
[62:02] um it really takes uh much time to put
[62:07] valuable information into 21 minutes I
[62:11] uh yeah I didn't expect that to be a
[62:14] such a big a challenge uh but um I want
[62:17] the podcast to
[62:19] be um yeah something that you can also
[62:22] start in a year so I don't put um the
[62:26] latest information inside I don't do
[62:28] interviews at the moment um I just
[62:31] explain content in a way that it's
[62:34] digestible by everybody without uh any
[62:37] knowledge in terms of Finance or without
[62:40] any economics background without any
[62:42] Tech background
[62:45] um yeah but let's say let's see what the
[62:50] future will bring once I'm out of the
[62:52] Fiat Fiat
[62:54] game it does a lot to your brain when
[62:57] you have a full-time commitment to to
[62:59] one thing and especially if it's Bitcoin
[63:02] uh it I'm I'm already looking forward to
[63:05] what you will do in the in the in the
[63:07] coming uh years once you are free and
[63:10] out in the wild let's say like
[63:13] that um is there anything uh you you
[63:16] look forward to to this year except uh
[63:20] you you making the the jump to the
[63:22] Bitcoin
[63:23] World wow yeah I mean this is such an
[63:26] exciting year right we have the
[63:28] elections in the United States we have
[63:31] many
[63:32] geopolitical uh issues but since it's
[63:35] the the first uh the first so-called
[63:39] Bull Run that um I actively experien
[63:43] because I just
[63:44] started yeah during the peak of the last
[63:47] one right I'm really excited to talk to
[63:51] to newbies so people who really fell
[63:54] into the rabit are really excited cannot
[63:57] stop talking about the topic um I really
[64:01] uh hope first of all that it happens and
[64:04] uh yeah that I get to uh get in touch
[64:07] with these people and I I I yeah I'm
[64:10] really yeah happy to see how the space
[64:13] evolves and this is kind of uh just
[64:16] around the corner so um yeah I think
[64:19] this this will be uh the most exciting
[64:22] part this or next
[64:24] year our end routine today is also kind
[64:27] of in in that direction but before we
[64:29] have one more question um what are you
[64:32] currently passionate about or learning
[64:35] deeply uh besides uh the things that we
[64:38] already covered in the podcast is there
[64:39] anything that you learning or are you
[64:43] passionate about that we did not cover
[64:44] in the podcast till now yes there are
[64:47] many things actually so uh first of all
[64:50] I try to learn how to create reals and
[64:53] social media and stuff because if I do
[64:56] Bitcoin education um of course I have to
[65:00] to cover social media in in a digital
[65:02] space right or in a digital world uh and
[65:06] I have to admit it's really hard for
[65:08] bitcoiners on Instagram so if anybody
[65:11] has uh um yeah figured out how to um
[65:15] yeah how to increase content Etc on
[65:19] Instagram please reach out I would be
[65:21] happy uh about that and uh what I also
[65:24] learn is related to more spiritual
[65:28] topics so um yeah like I said once I I F
[65:35] found out okay the way I I was looking
[65:37] at economics is different now so what is
[65:40] true uh how can I define truth is truth
[65:44] uh accessible for humans at all these
[65:47] kind of things uh these led me
[65:50] to yeah to to get yeah to to yeah to to
[65:55] read read a lot
[65:57] about uh where where are we coming from
[66:02] what are our Origins uh what is meaning
[66:05] of life uh these kind of things but I'm
[66:08] uh still in the process and there's so
[66:11] so much more to learn uh so maybe this
[66:13] is um in five years or so when there's
[66:17] no not so much education needed anymore
[66:20] because everything will be on the on
[66:23] yeah on the table uh maybe this will be
[66:26] the next
[66:27] project the the small questions like the
[66:29] meaning of life you're trying to answer
[66:32] small questions you're
[66:34] right amazing we have an endro te in the
[66:37] podcast where the previous guest is
[66:38] asking a question for the next guest uh
[66:40] without knowing who the next guest
[66:42] actually is uh and your question from
[66:44] the previous guest is how high do you
[66:47] think Bitcoin will go till the end of
[66:49] the year
[66:51] oh yeah that is so difficult and I think
[66:54] I'm super biased because I read all
[66:57] the
[66:59] um uh statements by Adam back and Samson
[67:03] Ma and
[67:05] Etc uh but oh this is also what I'm
[67:08] learning at the moment to understand the
[67:10] Bitcoin power law uh because I learned
[67:13] it's not a model it's actually the
[67:15] growing uh DNA of Bitcoin so this is
[67:17] also what I learned in the Bitcoin space
[67:20] so uh and according to to power law I
[67:23] think oh is it this
[67:26] by the end of the year next year it
[67:27] should be um
[67:32] $200,000 if it exactly follows the model
[67:36] but of course
[67:38] um it might be higher or lower um this
[67:43] year I hope we really make it to
[67:46] 100,000 and this would be the
[67:49] guess yeah I I have two uh mentions for
[67:52] the guests uh for for the listeners we
[67:54] mentioned for Lina SAA quickly and I
[67:57] actually have an episode with her which
[67:59] was amazing and I also have with javani
[68:02] who is like the kind of the greator of
[68:04] the power law uh and advocate for it uh
[68:07] and over two hour episode with him like
[68:10] two hours and 15 uh where we dive deep
[68:14] into the power law really deep in the
[68:16] power law then I need to watch that yeah
[68:20] it's it's deep one like um he prepared
[68:23] um a presentation
[68:26] and I wanted to before we start the
[68:29] presentation I wanted to clear up some
[68:31] questions before and have him uh discuss
[68:34] a lot of uh like the the things that we
[68:36] have to discuss before and he started
[68:39] the presentation around minute 55 or
[68:42] something like that so it is like there
[68:45] a lot there was a whole podcast before
[68:47] the actual topic which was interesting
[68:50] and it was like for me it was like a
[68:52] Monday evening and we recorded till 1:00
[68:55] a.m. in the morning my time and I loved
[68:59] it so much but it was a lot and there's
[69:02] a lot of discussions around the power uh
[69:05] if it it makes sense or not and stuff
[69:07] like that but I encourage everybody to
[69:09] just like check it out and make their
[69:11] own opinion on that and I have a episode
[69:14] with him uh over two hours it's in my
[69:18] opinion a cre overview of the topic uh
[69:21] and from there you can go deeper uh and
[69:24] uh it's it's also one of my more
[69:27] successful episodes I think it got over
[69:29] 10,000 uh uh views only on on YouTube uh
[69:33] people really liked it and I wasn't
[69:35] astonished I think like 25 or 30% of the
[69:40] listeners actually watch it till the end
[69:42] like a two hour episode which is which
[69:45] is fascinating for me uh but yeah uh
