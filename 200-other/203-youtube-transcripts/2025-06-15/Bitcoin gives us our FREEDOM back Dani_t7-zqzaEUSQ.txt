[00:00] when you're on the exchange you're not
[00:01] using Bitcoin when you're not self cting
[00:04] you're not using Bitcoin because that's
[00:06] just a table on somebody's computer
[00:07] there is no such thing as a Bitcoin
[00:09] Bitcoin is not what matters Bitcoin is
[00:11] your vehicle for you to provide for
[00:13] yourself what matters a whole coin
[00:15] should be called as Satoshi Colombians
[00:17] are still oppressed because we are
[00:19] oppressed by corruption and we are
[00:21] oppressed by physical threat and uh it's
[00:26] a society where the criminals have
[00:30] Advantage I really liked Bitcoin 4 was
[00:32] the idea that nobody could mine your
[00:35] financial data anymore but the problem
[00:38] is that this is only relatively true and
[00:40] the more that you trust third parties in
[00:42] Bitcoin the less true it is around the
[00:45] world there is many people who are in
[00:47] disagreement with their government and
[00:49] are not able to take action or to take a
[00:52] stand because the government has too
[00:54] many tools to oppress them
[01:00] hi Danny how you doing everything fine
[01:02] are you on yes I'm very excited to be
[01:04] here it's been uh this is my second day
[01:06] though because I was at the um death day
[01:09] yesterday oh so it's been really fun how
[01:12] was it the death day did was there
[01:14] something interesting that stood out to
[01:15] you well I was particularly excited
[01:18] because Ben Arc was there and I like
[01:21] tinkering with gadgets and so we built
[01:25] this thing where like he built & bits
[01:29] and using that we have a small Hardware
[01:32] device which is a switch and then we
[01:35] connected a light to it and you
[01:37] configure the switch to the Wi-Fi and so
[01:42] we were able to turn on the light uh by
[01:45] making a payment on lightening nice I
[01:49] love it I love it so much are you are
[01:51] you in technical stuff in in Bitcoin or
[01:53] more like on the fundamental stuff and
[01:55] the economic stuff no I don't know e
[01:58] economics I think that that's one of the
[02:00] areas that I wish I understood better
[02:03] because my dad started economics and so
[02:07] I've always being given a hard time
[02:09] about that my whole
[02:12] life but no so I'm more more technical I
[02:15] went to school for computer science so
[02:18] um I love that
[02:20] um side of the business it's what I
[02:23] enjoy the most I'm not really a very
[02:24] good business person I'm more of a
[02:28] technical person and um yeah I really
[02:32] enjoy building things I think it's my
[02:34] favorite part uh so hopefully one day I
[02:38] can do kind of like what Ben AR does
[02:41] because that's um what I have the most
[02:45] fun doing so you want to build on top of
[02:48] Bitcoin yeah like iot devices but on
[02:51] bitcoin I love it a lot do you are doing
[02:54] uh uh right now the podcast with
[02:57] heartbeat yes I just started a podcast
[03:02] um and well the podcast is called
[03:06] Bitcoin Nando because I'm branching out
[03:08] on my own I love George and honestly I'm
[03:12] really grateful for George if I hadn't
[03:14] worked with him I wouldn't have had the
[03:16] courage to kind of step out of
[03:19] my uh my rules I I used to have very
[03:23] strict rules about social media and it
[03:25] was very adamant about being a ghost oh
[03:29] but um I don't know I don't know why I
[03:32] decided to step out of that that rule
[03:35] set and I started doing this
[03:37] podcast and the podcast is mostly
[03:40] technical although we did take like um
[03:43] like a little side side road where where
[03:46] I was doing a lot of interviews but I do
[03:49] want to focus mostly on teaching people
[03:52] how to be self- Sovereign and
[03:54] specifically for low no budget because
[03:57] like right now I think a lot of people
[03:59] believe believe that if you don't buy
[04:01] the like
[04:02] $250 full Noe and if you don't buy the
[04:07] the
[04:07] $200 Hardware wallet then you then you
[04:11] can't Bitcoin and I mean I know you can
[04:14] do it in the wallets for free and I all
[04:16] that but
[04:17] like you can you can run a node for no
[04:20] money you just need a hard drive and
[04:22] some reliable internet and you can use
[04:27] um open source
[04:30] technology to do the wallet portion of
[04:33] it so you don't really need to spend one
[04:35] cent in order to get on boarded onto
[04:38] Bitcoin so that's really my my love is
[04:43] going to be in that micro sector but I I
[04:46] am going to do um tutorials of all the
[04:49] regular devices because I do enjoy
[04:51] tinkering so I'm still going to do
[04:54] like tutorials with the mainstream
[04:57] devices and the ones that you buy for
[04:59] money and that work in America and work
[05:01] in Europe but but I'm always thinking
[05:03] about the people in South America and
[05:06] how they can participate of the Bitcoin
[05:09] economy so that's why I kind of trend
[05:12] that in that direction you you are also
[05:15] from there right yes I'm Colombian oh
[05:17] amazing H so I understood it right that
[05:20] you are now on your own not with
[05:21] heartbeat or is heartbeat the thing mm-
[05:24] so on your own nice I don't even knew
[05:28] that well I mean just happened like so
[05:30] recently that I kind of uh yeah I forgot
[05:35] to BR bring it up but love it yeah it's
[05:39] uh it's better to be on my own
[05:43] because uh being part of a team that is
[05:47] involved with marketing puts pressure on
[05:49] me to do certain things and honestly one
[05:51] you want to know one of the really
[05:52] strong reasons was because I kept on
[05:54] having this feeling that I wanted to say
[05:56] on my podcast that I didn't get paid to
[05:58] promote any of those products because
[06:01] that was that's the truth and that I
[06:02] pick the products because I think that
[06:04] they are uh
[06:06] technologically uh sound and and a good
[06:10] thing to to share with other people so
[06:14] uh it was kind of stressful that being
[06:17] in that situation was holding me back
[06:19] because ultimately that's a marketing
[06:21] company and they do receive money to
[06:23] promote products only that because I was
[06:26] just in a branch like it was true for me
[06:28] that I wasn't receiving to promote
[06:30] products but because I was a branch of
[06:31] the company it wasn't totally understood
[06:34] by the audience so I have to be on my
[06:37] own so that so
[06:40] that I can have more freedom to to have
[06:44] developers and other people trust that I
[06:48] have very neutral intentions and a
[06:51] neutral point of view I love it I love
[06:54] that you're on your own I always think
[06:56] that's that's a great choice I also like
[06:59] I do my podcast all by myself like I do
[07:02] every day a podcast and I do it all by
[07:04] myself all the podcast uh post
[07:06] production uh preparation everything and
[07:10] it's a lot of work yeah but I love the
[07:13] control like when I want to have a
[07:15] specific segment of the podcast featured
[07:18] in the trailer he has no second opinion
[07:21] on that it's just me and and I love that
[07:24] autonomy I love that control and
[07:26] ownership about that so I'm I'm really
[07:28] looking forward what you can do and
[07:30] uh it it might trigger something really
[07:32] great and that I feel like when when you
[07:34] take away constraints mhm you really get
[07:38] the full potential all of the S what you
[07:40] can do and I love to see that and we
[07:42] talked a little bit before before we
[07:44] started the podcast um what are your uh
[07:47] great Bitcoin topics uh and what are
[07:49] your things you want to talk about and I
[07:52] had one thing in there it's I had
[07:54] another guest on that said there is no
[07:56] such a thing as a Satoshi mhm and new
[07:59] said now there's no such thing as a
[08:01] Bitcoin what do you mean by
[08:04] that well what I said earlier was
[08:07] there's no such thing as a bitcoiner but
[08:10] what you just said is also true there is
[08:12] no such thing as a Bitcoin uh in fact uh
[08:16] on the network we all the denominations
[08:19] are in Satoshi so really every time you
[08:23] transact Bitcoin like Bitcoin doesn't
[08:24] exist every time you transact you're
[08:26] actually transacting in Satoshi and at
[08:29] some point the price of Bitcoin is going
[08:31] to get so high that we're not even going
[08:34] to talk about Bitcoins anymore so I
[08:37] don't know if we made a mistake with the
[08:38] naming conventions maybe one a whole
[08:41] coin should be called the Satoshi and
[08:44] then the Satoshi should be called
[08:46] Bitcoin because pretty soon we're not
[08:48] even going to talk about Bitcoin
[08:50] anymore that's also the unit buys right
[08:53] that's that's completely grabbed from me
[08:54] the the whole unit bias thing yeah
[08:57] exactly and it would like mitigate a
[08:58] little bit the unit bias but now that
[09:00] the industry is like so um developed
[09:04] it's kind of hard to change those
[09:06] standards yeah yeah but um what I was
[09:09] saying earlier is that I was saying that
[09:12] there is no such thing as a
[09:14] bitcoiner because the people who are in
[09:18] the Bitcoin ecosystem come from every
[09:22] corner of the world
[09:25] and like there is no like
[09:29] Bitcoin is for everybody just Bitcoin
[09:33] doesn't care it's just money and I say
[09:36] just with care because that being just
[09:39] money is a big deal but um but um
[09:43] Bitcoin is just money in the same way
[09:45] that the dollar is just the dollar the
[09:47] dollar doesn't care if you're corrupt if
[09:48] you're a criminal or you're a good
[09:50] person it's just there for you to use
[09:52] and for you to like get what the the
[09:56] goods and services that you want so in
[09:59] the same way bit Bitcoin is the same so
[10:01] you within the ecosystem you're going to
[10:03] have people with very strong and diverse
[10:07] beliefs um even though like some of the
[10:09] people who are in the ecosystem we like
[10:12] to think of ourselves as bitcoiners
[10:14] because we use
[10:16] Bitcoin the Bitcoin ethos is something I
[10:20] think there's some components that are
[10:22] flexible and then some components that
[10:24] are less flexible and the closer you
[10:27] stick to the actual char characteristics
[10:30] of the technology then the than the more
[10:33] really grounded those ethos are so like
[10:36] low time preference is definitely one of
[10:39] those like almost immovable ethos that
[10:42] does that does come with Bitcoin but you
[10:45] also have the gamblers on the exchanges
[10:47] trading like crazy people leveraging
[10:50] their lives away so and they are also
[10:54] bitcoiners so it's difficult to define a
[10:58] like the character istics of a true
[11:00] bitcoiner and
[11:03] sometimes it instead of being inclusive
[11:06] it's an exclusive term which
[11:09] marginalizes people out to be to be
[11:11] Outsiders of the Bitcoin Community when
[11:13] the Bitcoin Community We Are The
[11:16] Outsiders
[11:17] so it's a it's a delicate it's a
[11:20] delicate concept the thing about being a
[11:22] bitcoiner and what ethos and values
[11:25] you're supposed to follow yeah and
[11:27] that's that's something very true talked
[11:29] about that before and I loved it so much
[11:31] because um when I go on on Twitter and I
[11:34] see like oh bitcoiners has to eat meat
[11:36] no there's weans like I I experienc I
[11:40] myself experienced that like I tried
[11:41] weeg I tried only meat I I just like try
[11:44] a lot of things because I want to
[11:45] experience those things and the
[11:47] advantages and disadvantages of
[11:49] that but that's not a bit corner just
[11:52] just just because you eat meat and you
[11:55] think it's a great idea it's not because
[11:58] of that that all bitcoiners should be
[12:00] like that I think that's because uh kind
[12:02] of Bitcoin is like a mirror and I
[12:04] thinkal enry uh the who make the nice uh
[12:08] things they make the nice new piece art
[12:11] where it's just a mirror and that's what
[12:13] Bitcoin is like you project your values
[12:15] onto that and then you think whole
[12:18] Bitcoin is like
[12:19] that yeah I think the underlying like
[12:24] ethos that is true about Bitcoin is that
[12:27] it it encourag you to search the best of
[12:32] things so because like look in in the
[12:35] United States the meat is terrible so
[12:36] like if if we're talking about
[12:38] McDonald's meat then meat then eating
[12:41] just meat is not a good idea and and
[12:44] also it depends on your body type for
[12:46] some people eating meat is a great idea
[12:49] for others like me I love my veggies I
[12:51] love my potatoes and I'm still going to
[12:53] be a bitcoiner and I'm going to eat my
[12:55] veggies when I go to
[12:57] the to the meat up because I love them
[13:01] and so I think uh I people get
[13:05] intimidated by like how social media
[13:07] works and so it does become a little bit
[13:11] intense but I think in terms of your
[13:13] nutrition every person should find what
[13:15] makes you feel the best but what is true
[13:18] is you want to find the best meat or you
[13:21] want to stick to like the high quality
[13:23] oils or you want to
[13:25] like it's not necessarily that you
[13:28] should eat just meat is that you should
[13:30] try to find the best within that like a
[13:34] striving in the same way that the money
[13:36] is hard then the work should be like
[13:39] hard work but not in the sense that
[13:41] you're going to overexert yourself but
[13:42] in the sense that the work is worth
[13:45] something and so you want your meat to
[13:47] come from a good place and be correctly
[13:49] sourced and you want like your your cold
[13:53] storage to be from a open source like
[13:56] good technology and you want your
[13:58] children like the the family values I
[14:00] think that that's amazing I think it's
[14:03] amazing that Bitcoin because people like
[14:05] like from the outside see Bitcoin like
[14:09] as greed and
[14:10] capitalism but like when you're here
[14:12] it's such a different experience I was
[14:14] um at a at like the women's Gathering
[14:17] earlier today and their talk was
[14:22] about like how welcoming Bitcoin is to
[14:25] families and how like Bitcoin tries to
[14:28] support support the idea of having a
[14:31] strong family nucleus because Bitcoin
[14:34] wants your children well educated and
[14:37] they want your children to be like
[14:39] Sovereign and they want your children to
[14:41] not be part of the educational system
[14:45] that indoctrinates us to be submissive
[14:48] and to be compliant and to be um yeah
[14:54] willing to to participate in this so
[14:57] like the structure that our societ has
[15:00] this designed for to be good employees
[15:03] to be good employees and so like Bitcoin
[15:07] is a is a path like who would have
[15:09] thought that Bitcoin would be like
[15:11] encouraging people to to
[15:15] homeschool so it's a weird thing right
[15:18] yes all of the sudden all bitcoiners are
[15:20] homeschoolers mean Austria is not even
[15:23] possible it's illegal to home I think in
[15:25] Austria it's
[15:26] illegal it's just not possible yeah uh
[15:29] and it's it's it's weird but there's one
[15:31] thing that I feel like there's
[15:33] underlying uh on all of that and every
[15:36] Bitcoin I spoke to till now likes
[15:39] Freedom it's like freedom is that
[15:42] technology freedom is that one common
[15:45] theme that most people agree on we want
[15:47] more freedom but the thing is everyone
[15:51] interets Freedom differently everyone is
[15:53] like oh that's freedom for me that's
[15:55] freedom for me uh and there was even one
[15:57] guest on Gary Kon was he said um Robin
[16:01] give me the do me the favor and ask
[16:04] every guest of yours what is freedom for
[16:07] you I did not do that still now like I
[16:09] rarely ask people that but uh the you I
[16:12] think it's an interesting conversation
[16:14] so what is what how do you define
[16:16] Freedom what is freedom uh for you
[16:18] personally yeah well I'm Colombian so I
[16:21] have been exposed to what it's like to
[16:25] be living because in Colombia we had a
[16:29] very short dictatorship so so the
[16:32] oppression doesn't really come from the
[16:33] dict
[16:35] dictators but I would say that
[16:37] Colombians are still oppressed because
[16:39] we are oppressed by corruption and we
[16:41] are oppressed by physical threat
[16:46] basically and uh it's a society where
[16:50] the the criminals have the advantage and
[16:55] basically you you're always scared and
[16:58] looking over your shoulder which it
[17:01] which is strange because at the same
[17:02] time Colombians like for many many
[17:04] decades had like the ranking of the
[17:06] happiest country in the world and that's
[17:09] because in Colombia you can be very
[17:12] free and Colombians we love to dance and
[17:15] you can go and like hang out in a park
[17:18] and then you're dancing till 6:00 in the
[17:19] morning and you're like just hanging out
[17:21] with your friends and you experience
[17:24] like a strong sensation of Freedom while
[17:27] being
[17:29] like oppressed by fear and
[17:34] danger so for me freedom is not just
[17:38] like the
[17:40] ability to I to like buy stuff or go
[17:45] places to me freedom is also the ability
[17:48] to feel well-being to feel peace to feel
[17:51] safe the freedom especi I think to me
[17:55] the biggest correlation to Freedom or
[17:57] what Freedom means to me is to feel safe
[18:00] with who you are with what you do to
[18:02] feel safe to like express yourself to
[18:05] feel safe to engage in the activities
[18:07] you want to
[18:08] engage yeah does does Bitcoin make the
[18:11] world um a more freedom loving uh world
[18:15] or is it as you said in the beginning
[18:17] just money that basically we because I
[18:21] think about that a lot we when now when
[18:23] when we're now in the Bitcoin Community
[18:25] extremely Freedom loving extremely
[18:26] critical thinking really strong opinion
[18:29] I love being on the conference M uh
[18:31] there are only rare exceptions to that
[18:34] only rare exceptions to that um but
[18:36] sometimes I think about is that because
[18:38] we in an early special group early
[18:40] adopters because they think differently
[18:43] or is it because Bitcoin actually
[18:45] changes something in your brain and
[18:47] actually changes something in society
[18:49] because it fixes the incentives you
[18:51] think more longterm than than shortterm
[18:53] do you think that Bitcoin could actually
[18:56] on a society level on on like a human
[18:58] being level not Financial at all change
[19:01] something I'm going to take a side route
[19:05] before I get to the answer to your
[19:07] question because that because of
[19:10] this in Bitcoin people don't like to
[19:13] talk about fud which stands for fear
[19:17] uncertainty and
[19:20] doubt and things that cause f are like
[19:24] uh the idea that Bitcoin doesn't scale
[19:27] the like bitcoiners like to think of it
[19:31] being uh fully inclusive so
[19:36] like that it's available to everybody
[19:38] and to bank the unbanked and the truth
[19:41] is that Bitcoin can't Bank the unbanked
[19:44] because the unbanked are broke or not
[19:46] all of them many are unbanked because of
[19:48] because they're engaged in illegal
[19:50] activities but let's focus on like the
[19:52] the population that is has a low uh
[19:56] income or
[19:59] who have no savings or that live on the
[20:01] day-to-day like they are excluded from
[20:05] participating in Bitcoin because of high
[20:08] fees or they're excluded because uh the
[20:11] lightning network is still difficult to
[20:13] use or difficult to understand it's just
[20:16] for someone in the countryside in
[20:17] Colombia who may maybe has a phone it
[20:21] would be like a challenge to understand
[20:24] what you're talking to them about like
[20:25] paying with a lightening with a
[20:27] lightening wallet they're not going to
[20:29] they're like still we're not still at
[20:31] the place where we can Bank the unbanked
[20:34] hopefully it I mean it's only been 15
[20:37] years Bitcoin will evolve into being
[20:40] able to actually service these
[20:42] communities because when when Bitcoin
[20:44] first originated like they it could have
[20:48] they served the these communities
[20:50] because it was simpler to use uh back
[20:52] then when in the sense that it was just
[20:55] on chain and it was cheaper so you could
[20:58] like transact for very small amounts for
[21:02] micro payments which is now not really
[21:05] possible and also not all Bitcoin is
[21:08] fungible the majority of Bitcoin is
[21:10] fungible but the other day like a couple
[21:12] of Satoshi from the the first Satoshi
[21:15] from the first reward from them from
[21:18] after the haling got sold for like $20
[21:20] million something
[21:22] ridiculous so so I mean there's a lot of
[21:27] things that bitcoiners don't like to
[21:28] talk about because they can like detract
[21:32] people from from wanting to be involved
[21:35] in Bitcoin but the thing is that even
[21:38] though I don't I don't understand why we
[21:40] don't talk about them because we need to
[21:42] have these difficult conversations in
[21:44] order to grow to educate the audience
[21:47] like like mining centralization is a
[21:49] little bit scary and we should talk
[21:51] about it because that will encourage
[21:53] people to go and like figure out self-
[21:56] mining instead of hiding it because
[21:58] hiding it doesn't lead to like the
[22:01] solutions and um the thing is that even
[22:05] though all these obstacles exist or all
[22:08] these like challenges still uh are
[22:12] things that Bitcoin is going to have to
[22:13] overcome over time it's still the best
[22:16] hope that the PO that us as people have
[22:20] for freedom like even though all these
[22:23] challenges exist we shouldn't be afraid
[22:25] of them we shouldn't be afraid of the
[22:27] fud because despite all of the F even if
[22:30] half of it is
[22:32] true it's still the best option that we
[22:36] have to become more free and why is that
[22:39] well because before the the government
[22:43] needed kind of like your consent in
[22:45] order to to engage in like in like
[22:49] making policies and taking actions but
[22:52] now the governments around the world are
[22:56] quite autonomous with respect to their
[22:57] people for one because they can print
[23:00] money also because the way they raise
[23:03] the funds like because if you if if you
[23:06] don't agree with how the government is
[23:08] doing politics then you could uh like
[23:11] not pay taxes because you don't agree
[23:13] with what they're doing but nowadays if
[23:16] you do that you will your funds will be
[23:19] confiscated and you will go to prison so
[23:22] what I the way that I feel that Bitcoin
[23:25] brings the most freedom and empowerment
[23:27] to us the general population is because
[23:31] it it gives us back the power of H of
[23:36] getting the government to get our
[23:38] consent to establish policies for the
[23:43] community amazing how is this I get that
[23:46] ask uh a lot uh especially from outside
[23:49] of of Bitcoin people because what do you
[23:52] do when you're not able to save in
[23:54] Bitcoin like uh in Colombia or in other
[23:57] parts of the world where maybe the best
[23:59] thing you can do is like save 10 $10
[24:02] equivalent every month um do you think e
[24:06] every even for the person that has
[24:10] almost no savings or is living from day
[24:12] to day is Bitcoin doing something for
[24:15] them I guess it's in Colombia also a big
[24:18] topic I
[24:20] think it it will be I think it's still
[24:24] in a stage where the people in the
[24:28] develop countries are more quick to to
[24:32] to adopt because they have more access
[24:35] to like the technology and to education
[24:38] but the people who would benefit the
[24:40] most who are in like South America or
[24:43] developing
[24:44] countries will adopt it last because
[24:49] it's harder for them to get included in
[24:52] the infrastructure like getting Hardware
[24:54] wallets in South America is really
[24:56] difficult because they don't have
[24:57] distributors
[24:58] so it's going to be a much slower
[25:02] process for them to be able to get the
[25:05] benefits of the Bitcoin ecosystem but
[25:08] the Bitcoin ecosystem growing and and
[25:12] absorbing every day more people will
[25:15] eventually uh Foster an environment that
[25:18] will allow them to also participate in
[25:21] the ecosystem and I mean for me the most
[25:24] important thing is
[25:27] political and I think I mean political
[25:30] and economical because and I and in a
[25:34] sense we know that it was for Satoshi
[25:36] also because of what he engraved in the
[25:40] in
[25:41] the Genesis blog because he was
[25:44] basically calling out the fact that the
[25:47] way that the
[25:51] fiduciary economy works and how Banks
[25:55] can get into these horrible situations
[25:57] and the way bail them out is by diluting
[26:00] the the time of the middle and lower
[26:03] classes and and that's like for me
[26:07] that's very stressful because it's like
[26:10] the elites are stealing the time like
[26:13] literally your life force from
[26:16] you by impoverishing you and
[26:20] impoverishing your work so I think right
[26:24] now it's hard to see I mean there are
[26:27] places where it is happening like El
[26:29] Salvador and like in smaller communities
[26:31] around the world where Bitcoin is
[26:34] already like taking a foothold and it's
[26:36] starting to flourish they are seeing
[26:39] some of the benefits but I think at a at
[26:41] a larger scale it's going to take time
[26:44] for them to be able to experience the
[26:48] empowerment that comes from Bitcoin I
[26:50] love it so much and it ties back to to
[26:53] bitcoin and what's the actual mission of
[26:56] Bitcoin and just gets lost of feel like
[26:59] um I wanted to ask you that before I
[27:00] forgot it um when we talked about that's
[27:03] that's not a bitcoiner or like what is a
[27:05] bitcoiner because is there something or
[27:09] when you have to point at one thing in
[27:11] the Bitcoin Community what does annoy
[27:13] you the
[27:14] most what annoys me the
[27:19] most well
[27:21] yesterday there was no line in the
[27:24] girl's bathroom which was wonderful
[27:29] but it also makes me a little sad it
[27:32] also stresses me out a little bit but I
[27:35] think it also has to do with like being
[27:37] tolerant because ER it when I said it
[27:41] was kind of overwhelming and kind of
[27:43] threatening the social Bitcoin social
[27:45] media is a little bit rough yes and a
[27:48] little bit harsh and I don't know if a
[27:51] lot of women are willing to to tolerate
[27:54] that kind of brutal Behavior
[28:00] but like I I do wish I could see more
[28:04] women or female like
[28:07] um I don't know like female energy or
[28:10] female power within Bitcoin
[28:13] because uh we're great Educators and uh
[28:18] we're very compassionate we could do
[28:21] good I agreed to 100% I had even a
[28:24] podcast on uh uh where we talked about
[28:27] that specific topic which was really
[28:29] fascina not the topic not the The Talk
[28:31] itself uh but the reaction was so
[28:35] interesting uh because I put like a
[28:37] really like we need more women in the in
[28:39] Bitcoin and the reaction was like oh we
[28:43] don't like really aggressive even uh
[28:46] nothing really bad but that was really
[28:48] like an interesting uh push back push
[28:51] back to to see I'm like no Bitcoin
[28:54] should be growing organically we don't
[28:56] have to like do this uh which is also uh
[29:00] interesting for me now do do you see a
[29:02] way where we could because right now
[29:06] it's Undisputed there are so many more
[29:08] guys than girls in the in the community
[29:11] like I have on my YouTube channel 95% uh
[29:15] male audience uh and even uh the biggest
[29:19] I think uh Bitcoin YouTuber uh uh female
[29:23] bitco YouTuber Nat prell she has 20%
[29:29] audience like even a woman only has 20%
[29:32] of females listening of course when I'm
[29:34] a guy even on a split split basis in a
[29:38] community probably have more guys than
[29:39] girls listening to me but is there any
[29:42] way that you can imagine like this being
[29:45] better like you imagine like oh how can
[29:48] we what can the Bitcoin community and
[29:50] content creators as myself and other
[29:52] content creators too to be more
[29:54] welcoming I don't want to promote only
[29:56] the wom of course but I want to be
[29:58] uh that everyone can listen to my
[30:00] podcast and not be like that's that's
[30:02] not from uh
[30:05] woman I was the only woman in every
[30:07] single room that I sat down yesterday
[30:09] except for one who was a
[30:11] [Laughter]
[30:13] speaker
[30:15] um the thing is that like I feel uh torn
[30:21] because I'm a single
[30:23] mom
[30:25] and it wasn't really a until I became a
[30:29] single mom that I realized that I
[30:31] disliked some of the values that I had
[30:33] grown up with I don't think men and
[30:36] women are equal I don't think either one
[30:40] is
[30:41] better
[30:43] um we we just have differences that
[30:46] should complement each other I mean if
[30:49] you're not going to have a family then
[30:51] it's simpler but in in a family the
[30:55] children are the one who pay
[30:58] if there isn't like a balance in the
[31:01] dynamic
[31:03] so for me I
[31:06] think
[31:08] um the role of the woman in the home is
[31:13] undervalue so it's hard for me to push
[31:17] for women to be like the
[31:19] lead when I kind of agree that someone
[31:23] needs to nurture the children very
[31:26] strongly so so I do wish there were more
[31:30] women in Bitcoin and like two weeks ago
[31:33] I was talking to George about making
[31:34] Amendment but normally the memes in
[31:37] Bitcoin are like the wife is like why
[31:39] are we buying more Bitcoin but this m
[31:42] was the wife like old school wife uh
[31:45] chasing the husband with the broom and
[31:47] saying like why haven't you put it in
[31:49] cold
[31:50] [Laughter]
[31:53] storage because like that's that's the
[31:56] kind of women that we could also have in
[31:58] Bitcoin she doesn't have to be at the
[32:01] Forefront of like handling the family
[32:04] economy but she could be like a healthy
[32:07] advisor which is what women I mean I'm
[32:10] not saying that's their only role and
[32:11] then the man has the life I I totally
[32:13] believe that women should have a life
[32:15] and a career because that's also what I
[32:18] have done and I do and I think the
[32:21] reason you have the right to do that is
[32:23] because it's really fun and really
[32:24] exciting and really super rewarding to
[32:26] have like
[32:28] your so like a social and intellectual
[32:33] development but like it it's also super
[32:36] rewarding to being at home with my
[32:38] daughter and sharing with her and seeing
[32:39] her grow so I just think that women um
[32:43] how could they be is that I agree with
[32:46] the men that say that I don't think that
[32:49] the information should be presented in a
[32:50] different way because in my opinion the
[32:53] information is out there and it's just a
[32:55] matter of curiosity but we do live in a
[32:57] society that encourages like that
[32:59] Dynamic where the man should be like
[33:01] solely responsible and the leader of the
[33:05] whole situation where really the the
[33:07] most successful couples come from people
[33:09] who work together and and can advise
[33:13] each other and protect each other and
[33:14] like have joint dreams so I just think
[33:19] it's a matter of women being curious
[33:21] and and I don't know I just I wish I
[33:26] knew cuz I want them to come
[33:29] too if you are listening to this podcast
[33:32] you might be wondering what is actually
[33:34] the setup look like of Robin or how can
[33:37] I improve my Bitcoin setup and there's
[33:39] two things you have to buy Bitcoin from
[33:41] the right source and you have to store
[33:43] Bitcoin the right way let's focus on the
[33:45] first thing how to buy Bitcoin it's
[33:47] simple have a Bitcoin only exchange
[33:50] don't deal with the shitcoin exchanges
[33:52] don't deal with an exchange that has an
[33:54] own token or something like that be on a
[33:56] Bitcoin only Exchange I use 21 Bitcoin
[33:59] 21 Bitcoin is for me the best partner
[34:02] for that and now where do you store
[34:05] Bitcoin Bitcoin should be stored on a
[34:07] hardware wallet on a self custody
[34:10] solution where you yourself hold your
[34:12] keys and it should be a cold wallet so
[34:15] that's my Simple Solutions that's a
[34:18] bitbox you just put your Bitcoin on
[34:21] there back up your seat phas and you are
[34:23] better than 95% of all Bitcoin holders
[34:27] if you're you have more than a th000 in
[34:29] Bitcoin it's a absolutely must have I
[34:32] hear um when we talk about male versus
[34:36] female for me it's always like um when I
[34:39] see men they are more interested in
[34:41] things mhm like when I talk with my
[34:43] friends we usually talk about things we
[34:45] don't talk about other persons uh and
[34:47] and women seem to be more interested in
[34:50] uh other
[34:51] persons I I don't think it's necessarily
[34:53] other people but it's definitely like in
[34:55] their emotional world and so the
[34:58] emotional world does have a lot more to
[35:00] do with humans than it does with things
[35:02] so yeah I mean I'd say that's a fair I
[35:05] also think men uh have a larger capacity
[35:08] to focus on a single thing and women
[35:10] have a larger capacity to think about
[35:13] the big picture so it's
[35:18] just it when you can have like that
[35:20] tunnel vision which Bitcoin requires a
[35:23] little bit because you kind of have to
[35:25] go through this like rabbit hole and
[35:27] like dive and search and research and
[35:30] and then after a couple days then you
[35:31] come out and you're like okay okay okay
[35:33] okay this is the thing I want to do
[35:36] this it for women it might be like what
[35:39] is this like why am I going to do this
[35:41] my life is good how I am and like this
[35:43] is so complicated like what is this
[35:45] gimmick uh I'm not an investor I try
[35:48] trading I have to say trading is for for
[35:50] people with a very special character and
[35:54] I don't know if a lot of women if we
[35:56] have that character I
[35:58] think because you have to be very calm
[36:02] even when you're losing it's very
[36:05] stressful so I'm not saying women can't
[36:07] be good Traders I'm just saying I don't
[36:10] know if most of us are designed to do
[36:13] that kind of job and I think we have to
[36:15] when we whenever we talk about that
[36:17] stuff we always have to say um we are
[36:19] generalizing because there are uh
[36:22] females that are way more male than uh
[36:25] some males oh yeah yeah yeah for sure so
[36:27] always Outsiders of that but in those
[36:29] conversations uh it's it's like general
[36:31] terms and I wouldn't even see say women
[36:34] who are way more males I just say like
[36:37] women who have personalities that have
[36:41] like certain traits that men that come
[36:43] easier to men yes yeah so it's just I
[36:48] mean and
[36:50] nowadays a lot of men also lack like
[36:53] that
[36:54] Alpha energy and that like so it just
[36:58] goes both
[37:00] ways
[37:03] absolutely I I love it a lot where like
[37:06] you you start to talk about Bitcoin and
[37:08] you
[37:09] go you get some one Bitcoin topic I
[37:12] wanted to also talk with you is um as
[37:15] you said before you are in the technical
[37:17] stuff and you want to build on on on
[37:19] bitcoin is there
[37:21] something uh first question is there
[37:24] something that you would change on a
[37:27] fundamental layer on on on bitcoin core
[37:30] uh and
[37:31] second type of question is like what
[37:34] would you what do we still have to build
[37:37] on on on on bitcoin what what is the
[37:39] things that we need uh to build on on
[37:41] bitcoin uh or how satisfied are with
[37:45] lightning how satisfied with liquid f
[37:47] with all all
[37:49] that layer two stuff okay how how do you
[37:53] see that I mean on principle no on
[37:56] principle I wouldn't change anything
[37:58] about Bitcoin core
[38:01] um well Bitcoin core is the
[38:03] implementation but there are multiple
[38:07] implementations
[38:08] um there there is a bug in Bitcoin
[38:12] people like to say that there is never
[38:14] going to be any more hard Forks but
[38:17] there is at least one more hard Fork
[38:19] that is going to happen for sure because
[38:22] there is a integer overflow and like uh
[38:25] in a 100 years if we don't fix the code
[38:28] it's going to go
[38:30] crazy uh so when that
[38:34] happens there might be an introduction
[38:36] of other consensus changes the question
[38:39] is whether whether by the time that that
[38:43] bug gets fixed there will be consensus
[38:47] on changing anything else which is very
[38:50] unlikely it's unlikely that bitcoiners
[38:52] that the actual consensus rules will
[38:55] ever change because
[38:58] there's the the E the ecosystem is
[39:01] growing every day and with time it's
[39:03] only going to get bigger and it will be
[39:04] very hard because when you do a hard
[39:08] Fork if you change the consensus rules
[39:09] that causes a hard fork and what that
[39:11] means is that if everybody doesn't
[39:13] upgrade kind of at the same time the
[39:15] chain can split and and then some people
[39:18] will like just like a just like a
[39:20] Bitcoin cash it'll be two forks so
[39:24] that's dangerous the more that the
[39:27] Network grows so we'll see how that
[39:30] develops I do sometimes
[39:33] wonder like in
[39:36] 2140 when the reward well the like new
[39:42] minted coin coin from the coinbase the
[39:45] emission and finishes and all the supply
[39:48] of Bitcoin is in
[39:51] flow whether it would
[39:55] be considered to to change the block
[39:58] size or the intervals I mean people
[40:00] don't like to talk about block size but
[40:04] it's not I mean it doesn't need to be
[40:06] demonized it's very simple the reason
[40:08] people don't like to talk about blog
[40:10] size is because they want the size of
[40:14] the hardware to grow at the same rate as
[40:17] the
[40:18] technology the the for storing memory
[40:23] because they don't they want it to be
[40:25] inclusive and for people to to be able
[40:27] to run a full note because the the like
[40:30] let's let's call it the radical
[40:33] bitcoiners and
[40:35] maximalists are very adamant on the fact
[40:38] that everybody should be able to have a
[40:41] full note so that you can verify your
[40:43] own transactions and not trust any third
[40:45] parties and all those arguments are
[40:48] totally
[40:50] valid um but the if technology if there
[40:54] is a jump forward in techn te ology and
[41:00] and that's no longer a feasible argument
[41:03] for not to have larger blocks then
[41:05] things could
[41:07] change but it depends on the technology
[41:11] evolving excuse
[41:13] me on the technology evolving faster
[41:17] than is mathematically like understood
[41:21] that's an interesting I never heard that
[41:23] actually before uh when we have uh
[41:26] Bitcoin
[41:28] the argument against the block size
[41:30] increase uh but do we have water there's
[41:33] a I think there there's something in
[41:35] there so what what is very important
[41:38] when you
[41:39] speakin I always have it with me uh and
[41:43] when I was coming up I was like already
[41:45] checking is there
[41:47] enough so for people that just listened
[41:50] we we we we got something to
[41:53] drink thank you uh where was I like this
[41:57] I never heard that actually in the block
[41:59] size debate because I was like no we
[42:01] cannot increase the block size because
[42:03] then we need more space to operate a
[42:05] full node so then it gets more less
[42:08] inclusive and then we uh push people
[42:11] outside of Bitcoin but when the
[42:13] technology is just getting cheaper and
[42:15] cheaper every day uh because we're
[42:17] getting more efficient in developing the
[42:19] storage possibilities on here maybe at a
[42:22] point where uh what is now uh maybe
[42:26] costing 5050 100 to buy a storage device
[42:29] maybe costs in 100 years 5 compared to
[42:34] will be costing in EUR way more because
[42:36] the EUR will inflate a lot or will not
[42:37] be there anymore but let's let's use
[42:40] that as an example it will be so cheap
[42:42] compared to now that it might be an
[42:45] interesting idea to open up the block
[42:48] size debate on say like okay maybe a
[42:50] little bit more the only thing that I'm
[42:53] afraid of like let's let's always
[42:55] increase it a little bit a little bit
[42:57] and then in the end it gets to a massive
[42:58] thing where the block is uh like you
[43:01] open the the the box of bandora and and
[43:03] all of the sudden you have every five
[43:05] years an increase in Block size uh will
[43:08] be interesting to see you can also
[43:11] shorten the
[43:13] interval of 10 minutes but then you're
[43:16] also playing with the time spent for
[43:18] relaying the blocks across the network
[43:21] and you would be at higher risk of
[43:23] having orphan blocks and like other
[43:26] stuff happening
[43:27] but uh but have in mind that every time
[43:30] that you change the block size you would
[43:32] have to have a hard Fork so I don't
[43:34] think it's feasible for it to ever be a
[43:37] situation where it would change often or
[43:39] even in a like even every 5 years uh I
[43:43] think if if it was to be done it would
[43:46] have to be
[43:48] like like it would have to be like
[43:51] chunky because I think you would only
[43:54] get to do it once
[43:57] so I think if that was a choice what
[44:00] because like there could be breakthrough
[44:02] in data storage with like if somebody
[44:04] learns how to store the blockchain on a
[44:06] piece of DNA then who knows what's going
[44:08] to
[44:09] happen but like for now it's totally
[44:13] understandable why the people like the
[44:16] bitcoiners uh shot that topic down so
[44:19] harshly I'm curious to understand like
[44:21] before why did you think that the block
[44:24] size because it's such a hashash subject
[44:27] why did you what did you feel was the
[44:30] reason before we spoke
[44:32] today uh the the block say why it should
[44:35] not be increased yeah uh for me was uh
[44:38] told a little bit before it was like
[44:40] when you increase it then the total
[44:43] storage uh that you need for full node
[44:45] will increase also yeah uh and therefore
[44:49] when you have a higher cost of operating
[44:52] a full node when you need more storage
[44:54] and the second reason was like if you if
[44:56] if you increase it once maybe you
[44:59] increase it twice uh and this is
[45:02] like why why should we increase like I'm
[45:06] always like I I'm a software developer I
[45:09] was a software developer myself I'm not
[45:11] a great one uh just that like when
[45:13] someone asked me a specific question on
[45:15] the Bitcoin code or some like I'm I'm
[45:16] I'm opting
[45:18] out I'm not the most technical person
[45:20] but I was soft develop in front and and
[45:22] back end for three years uh and for me
[45:26] always the thing was especially the
[45:28] senior developers were always really
[45:30] cautious with change they're
[45:32] like there might be a small change that
[45:36] might be innocent but then all of the
[45:38] sudden it changes something completely
[45:40] else that you didn't even notice so I'm
[45:43] always a little bit on the front like
[45:44] don't change too much on the main base
[45:47] layer as with the tcpip protocol as with
[45:50] the other protocols and then we can go
[45:52] on to Second layers third layers
[45:54] whatever this is and push something for
[45:57] for example also the debate on utxos at
[46:00] some point we will have the
[46:02] possibilities that not everybody can
[46:05] afford um uh main layer Bitcoin
[46:07] transactions because the transaction
[46:09] will be costing so much that's why you
[46:11] also have to manage your utxo in a in a
[46:14] a good manner so they don't get
[46:17] stuck that is a dangerous uh area
[46:21] because recently I interviewed John
[46:24] carvalo and he made me aware of the fact
[46:27] that the lightning Network requires for
[46:31] you to be able to settle on chain for
[46:34] you to be able to enforce the correct
[46:36] incentives for good
[46:38] behavior so the Bitcoin fees on chain
[46:42] can never be so high that it
[46:47] disables the second
[46:49] layer users from settling on chain and
[46:53] what what I heard with uh Wicked he was
[46:57] saying he he doesn't see lightning as an
[46:59] everyday thing he sees lightning
[47:02] actually between uh figer institutions
[47:04] and between other layers which like this
[47:07] is a topic where I'm like really feeling
[47:10] uh from my knowledge base
[47:11] uncomfortable I'm basically repeating
[47:13] what other people said here um but I'm
[47:16] really interested in how scaling Bitcoin
[47:18] works and that's why I'm asking it more
[47:20] and more on my podcast if people are
[47:22] think I have have a good opinion that
[47:24] like you so how do you how do you see
[47:26] that
[47:27] uh yeah cuz like basically the bottom
[47:29] line is that Bitcoin on chain doesn't
[47:32] scale and so um and people don't like to
[47:37] talk about that too much because it it
[47:39] causes
[47:40] stress no no no my Bitcoin is perfect
[47:44] yes but the but it's fine it doesn't
[47:47] mean it doesn't mean the end for Bitcoin
[47:49] you had asked me about lightning earlier
[47:51] and I didn't answer you so we this is
[47:53] the perfect opportunity to talk talk
[47:55] about it hopefully I mean like I said
[47:56] it's only been like how many years are
[47:59] we into 12 years 12 years no 24 no we're
[48:04] it's been 15 years 16 years now on the
[48:07] 16 yes we are 16 years okay so we're on
[48:11] the 16th year so I mean that's nothing
[48:15] we so many more new amazing things are
[48:18] going to happen that we haven't even
[48:20] thought about maybe lightning is going
[48:23] to be the the second layer that lasts
[48:25] the test of time but maybe other thing
[48:28] comes around that we haven't even
[48:30] considered that uh brings a new way of
[48:34] using Bitcoin and settling on chain that
[48:37] kind of uh continues to solve this
[48:40] problem for
[48:41] everybody yeah I mean it's um lightening
[48:45] is not ideal because it's difficult to
[48:46] use and you have to have channels
[48:48] between people but it's still peer-to
[48:50] peer it's still uh I mean
[48:55] relatively PR
[48:58] private like this is why it's hard to
[49:00] have like one Bitcoin Community with one
[49:02] ethos because like one of the things
[49:04] that I really liked Bitcoin for was the
[49:07] idea that nobody could mine your
[49:10] financial data anymore but the problem
[49:13] is that this is only relatively true and
[49:15] the more that you trust third parties in
[49:17] Bitcoin the less true it is so for me
[49:22] like I don't want to just have a have a
[49:26] a wallet that is self- custodial for me
[49:29] that's only like half of the equation it
[49:31] has to be self- custodial and it needs
[49:34] to be connected to your own node because
[49:36] you should not be trusting third
[49:38] parties so
[49:41] so but all those demands are quite
[49:46] stringent and the m and the and the like
[49:50] uh like common consumer might not care
[49:53] about these things as much as I do and
[49:57] might be willing to have their Sovereign
[50:00] the their financial D data exposed in
[50:03] exchange for EAS of
[50:06] use
[50:08] so if if we sa when we sacrifice our
[50:13] privacy a little bit we can get cheaper
[50:16] and ease of use that's an interesting
[50:20] discussion because now we're pushing for
[50:22] self- custody and everything and then
[50:24] I'm going to my Nori friends
[50:29] and and then they're like I have pre
[50:30] coiners pre coiners no no they half
[50:32] Bitcoin oh okay my normally friends that
[50:35] have Bitcoin but not are deep in the
[50:37] Bitcoin comp they're like what I have to
[50:39] buy some like1 device again to like do
[50:43] the self custody then what happens when
[50:46] I screw up they're like I trust them
[50:48] more than I trust
[50:50] myself I he it a lot but I feel that way
[50:54] a lot as well to me I think that the
[50:56] biggest obstacle for for Bitcoin
[50:58] adoption is self- custody because with
[51:00] the power comes the responsibility yes
[51:03] and the responsibility freaks everybody
[51:05] out it's like I do not want to be
[51:07] responsible for my money and and I
[51:09] empathize I empathize because I feel the
[51:12] same way it is scary and like you're
[51:14] freaked out that you're going to
[51:16] mismanage your keys and you're going to
[51:17] lose them and you're not going to write
[51:18] them down and you're going to and then
[51:20] you're going to like send your money to
[51:23] like some scam and like oh my God you're
[51:25] going to make a typo the address and and
[51:28] and and you always hear that stories
[51:31] it's it's not like that it's never
[51:32] happening you always hear those stories
[51:34] like oh uh he lost two Bitcoin there he
[51:37] lost 25 Bitcoin there he lost 400
[51:39] Bitcoins there I'm like that happens to
[51:42] people and possibly because and that's
[51:44] what I mean by privacy POS people might
[51:47] be willing to hold their money in a
[51:49] Bitcoin
[51:50] bank that is insured so like if
[51:54] something happens like if the bank gets
[51:56] hacked
[51:57] the insurance will pay you back your
[51:58] money you know but
[52:02] but you that's not
[52:04] Bitcoin that's no Bitcoin like if if if
[52:08] your Bitcoin are not there anymore it's
[52:11] it's it's gone no what I mean is like
[52:14] not your seats not your not your keys
[52:17] not it it's not just not your Bitcoin
[52:19] it's not even Bitcoin like if it's not
[52:22] your keys that what you're using is not
[52:24] Bitcoin
[52:27] actually it's paper pit digital it's a
[52:30] someone's Excel sheet so like when
[52:31] you're on the exchange you're not using
[52:33] Bitcoin when you're not self- cting
[52:36] you're not using Bitcoin when you
[52:38] because that's just a table on
[52:39] somebody's
[52:40] computer uh so yeah so that th those
[52:45] things aren't really Bitcoin and I think
[52:47] earlier you asked me about if I thought
[52:49] that like why the people who are
[52:51] bitcoiners are interested in Freedom so
[52:55] I think part of the answer to your
[52:57] question is what we're talking about
[52:58] right now because the PE the only people
[53:01] who are willing to endure self- custody
[53:03] are the ones who are interested in
[53:07] Freedom the other people are just not
[53:10] motivated enough to escape the system
[53:12] like I have nothing to hide I have
[53:15] nothing but gratitude for the United
[53:17] States I like uh I don't know like I I'm
[53:21] not in a situation where I have to fight
[53:23] my
[53:23] government well the Colombians I hate
[53:26] the most a little bit but I love I love
[53:28] my Colombian
[53:29] people um so like but that doesn't make
[53:34] me blind to the fact that around the
[53:36] world there is many people who
[53:39] are in disagreement with their
[53:41] government and are not able to take
[53:44] action or to take a stand because the
[53:47] government has too many tools to oppress
[53:49] them so that's I do I do all that effort
[53:54] because I never want to see myself in
[53:56] the issues of the people who I see
[53:59] suffering around us I love it so much I
[54:03] love it so much it's always with podcast
[54:06] the longer it goes the better it
[54:08] gets I don't know if you also uh
[54:10] experienced that yeah at the end it's
[54:13] like oh but now I want to ask four more
[54:15] question four more
[54:17] question it's like the the second half
[54:19] hour is always better than the first
[54:21] half hour and then then it goes on and
[54:23] on yeah it's it's it's it's it's really
[54:25] cool um so the one thing uh that I
[54:28] always ask my guests now it's kind of a
[54:31] new endro tee to my podcast uh before we
[54:34] come to the actual end routine is what
[54:36] are you most uh passionate about besides
[54:40] Bitcoin like besides that all Bitcoin
[54:42] stuff that we talked about right now is
[54:44] if any anything else that you're really
[54:46] passionate about deeply learning about
[54:48] and I always like to also give the
[54:49] reason why I'm asking that is because
[54:51] Bitcoin is an extremely diverse group of
[54:53] people and we can extremely we can learn
[54:56] a lot from each other and I want to give
[54:59] with that question the platform so we
[55:01] can learn something else than all the
[55:04] money stuff that you always learn from
[55:05] each other I mean I have to I mean as a
[55:08] mom I have to say that my number one is
[55:13] my daughter cuz
[55:15] like so like everything that has to do
[55:18] with being a child and like their
[55:20] development like how to support her so
[55:24] that I'm super grateful for the school I
[55:26] went to like I I I thought my school
[55:30] gave me an amazing education but it
[55:33] comes with a whole baggage of horrible
[55:35] things so what I try to ask myself all
[55:39] the time is how how can I ever manag to
[55:43] provide my daughter the level of
[55:44] Education that I received without
[55:47] totally like
[55:49] subjecting her to the whole ethos and
[55:52] the whole indoctrination that comes with
[55:54] being in a in a official school yes so
[55:58] that's that's what I kind of like to
[56:00] think about the most is how to that's my
[56:03] passion is to be there for her to learn
[56:07] how to be there for her because you also
[56:10] like I think the parents who get to like
[56:14] when their children are teenagers and
[56:17] then the teenagers are crazy it's not
[56:19] because the teenager didn't change
[56:22] correctly and grow correctly into the
[56:23] right person is because the parents
[56:26] were not able to evolve correctly so
[56:29] that by the time that they were te their
[56:31] children were teenagers they could get a
[56:33] healthy relationship with their
[56:36] children so for me it's like about a lot
[56:38] about like personal development and it
[56:42] it makes you such a better person when
[56:44] you have a child because
[56:46] you you have to become more patient and
[56:49] more respectful and more uh uh present
[56:54] and you have to do everything you had
[56:57] already done for yourself like twice as
[57:01] hard because like it's your child so you
[57:03] want them to like do good and be happy
[57:07] Al so like yeah it's just um that's what
[57:11] I most passionate about I think I think
[57:14] even more than
[57:15] Bitcoin it's good that it's more than
[57:18] Bitcoin like Bitcoin does not has to be
[57:20] the the number one thing in in your life
[57:23] for me right now it's kind of Bitcoin
[57:25] right now
[57:26] uh I mean I do a lot of like uh how to
[57:29] do the podcast how to grow it like
[57:31] that's like number two thing maybe uh
[57:34] and the the other thing that I do in my
[57:36] freedom when I don't do something
[57:39] productive I just love spending time
[57:41] with my girlfriend that's that's your
[57:43] grandfather uh my girlfriend oh oh
[57:46] grandfather also me that would be super
[57:48] sweet I actually have a sweet story that
[57:51] I never told about my grandfather on the
[57:53] podcast um I was living in alberg that
[57:57] is a really small place a town where I
[58:00] was growing up uh and there my
[58:03] grandfather uh was the one that always
[58:07] um was there for me after school mhm and
[58:10] they had a farm okay and I was the one
[58:13] weird child because I was tall also
[58:16] everyone I saw oh wow you so tall um I
[58:20] was also tall when I was like 8 nine
[58:21] years old oh my God and I was actually
[58:24] driving in tractor with 8 n years old MH
[58:28] myself like my my uh Grandpa was next to
[58:31] me and learned me everything but with 8
[58:33] n years old I was driving a tractor and
[58:35] one day like my my dad saw like what are
[58:38] you doing I'm doing so were there
[58:42] animals on the farm or was it a crop
[58:44] farm animal like it was cows pigs horses
[58:48] it was it was a dream come true for
[58:50] every child I only notice it now because
[58:54] I see now what amazing environment this
[58:56] was actually for me how deeply rooted
[58:58] the self-confidence I got from there is
[59:01] because I got so many animals I got the
[59:04] I got the drust from a grandpa with 9
[59:07] years old to operate a massive Machinery
[59:11] uh um most most parents are uh like so
[59:15] protecting of the child that they forget
[59:17] to they also have to make mistakes mhm
[59:20] they also have to do something uh on
[59:23] their own and cannot always be protected
[59:25] and then a lot of insecurities are
[59:27] created I think as I have no clue from
[59:29] parting but as I see it no and the city
[59:33] is super strange I mean and like imagine
[59:36] uh growing up always in the city and
[59:39] never experiencing like I think that
[59:42] that's why uh like the young Generations
[59:45] have such a problem with social media
[59:47] because it's not just social media it's
[59:49] social media and being in the city all
[59:52] the time you know cuz like if you were
[59:55] if you're in the Countryside you can
[59:57] tell the difference between the real
[59:59] world and social
[60:02] media but when you're in the city it's
[60:04] like it's consuming you it's all over
[60:06] you it's like I don't know how to
[60:08] explain it and when you're in the
[60:10] countryside you're more in contact with
[60:12] nature you're like going and you're like
[60:14] riding a horse and you're like touching
[60:16] a flower and you're seeing a Sunset and
[60:19] it's like okay this is life this moment
[60:21] here is life and then like what's
[60:23] happening on that computer is just like
[60:24] what people are saying and it's not that
[60:27] that's not life because when it like
[60:30] sometimes if you get too absorbed in
[60:32] social media like I don't even know like
[60:34] at the extreme what it feels like but I
[60:37] think yeah I a lot of the younger
[60:41] generation that are like in school and
[60:42] they just go from the school and then
[60:44] they're on the computer is just really
[60:46] like how can you not become like full of
[60:49] anxiety and stress and like be depressed
[60:51] about what your friends say on social
[60:53] media if that's your real if that's real
[60:56] instead of like the horse the sunset the
[60:58] flow the milk the chicken absolutely and
[61:02] that's why I like uh having the focus on
[61:05] the family and the close friends is
[61:08] really important because that's the real
[61:10] world not the the social media not the
[61:12] the random stranger out there and by the
[61:15] way I'm super thankful that I have that
[61:17] social media thing MH because it gives
[61:19] me so many connections real world
[61:21] connections there are like so many
[61:23] people running around the BR and the
[61:25] behind uh behind us behind you and I'm
[61:28] like uh I know he I know him I like it's
[61:32] such a great experience I love it so
[61:34] much and I got to know so many people
[61:36] already I'm just like a few hours here
[61:38] that I never saw in person just like you
[61:40] I never saw you in person but we know
[61:42] each other from the podcast we know each
[61:44] other from Twitter and telegram so now I
[61:47] see you in person and that's all the
[61:49] real world uh but you have to set set it
[61:52] apart like that's not only your world
[61:54] that's that's some other thing and we
[61:57] have to have to put real world and you
[61:59] can use the social media world to expand
[62:03] your real
[62:04] world yeah and there's obviously part of
[62:06] social media is real in the sense that
[62:08] like the support from your like fan base
[62:11] and them being able to access the the
[62:13] resources and the education and the
[62:15] information that you put out there like
[62:18] that's like that's actually like a real
[62:20] like solid
[62:22] exchange it's more yeah it's more like
[62:26] the clicks and
[62:27] the yeah yeah it's it's fascinating
[62:31] topic it's funny how where we
[62:34] are and like what's really interesting
[62:37] is that Bitcoin like Bitcoin is not what
[62:39] matters Bitcoin is your vehicle for you
[62:42] to provide for yourself what matters but
[62:44] it does kind of consume your whole um
[62:47] thinking because you just kind of get
[62:49] sucked into this rabbit hole but yeah
[62:51] Bitcoin is Bitcoin is not even Bitcoin
[62:54] is not Bitcoin is our number number one
[62:56] just cuz it's obsessive but really
[62:57] Bitcoin is not your number one your
[62:59] number two your number three Bitcoin is
[63:00] your number 10 so just so that you can
[63:02] get number one through nine and like and
[63:06] ho hopefully those things are supporting
[63:09] your family having like healthy access
[63:12] to good source food access to education
[63:17] that you think like your child can grow
[63:19] up with being a a critical thinker you
[63:23] know yeah amazing uh uh I love it a lot
[63:27] um now let's come to our actual end tee
[63:32] okay um where the previous guest is
[63:34] asking a question for the next guest uh
[63:37] and the previous uh guest had the
[63:40] question for you uh how do you imagine
[63:43] the future of self- custody especially
[63:47] and we talked even a little bit about
[63:49] that especially when most people are too
[63:51] lazy to the to do the work we covered it
[63:55] a little bit but maybe you have uh
[63:57] something that you want to add to
[64:03] that well it's cuz yeah there's that
[64:05] difference between self- custody and
[64:07] running your own node and trusting th
[64:10] third parties in a different way which
[64:12] is running your own
[64:13] node um like we just talking about self
[64:17] custody from like you have it on
[64:19] Exchange while now you have it on uh
[64:22] some other device you have it on a bit
[64:24] box you have it on some multi signature
[64:26] uh set up you have it on something that
[64:28] where you control the keys there's no
[64:30] noes there's then it that node I think
[64:33] it's the next level but I'm self cust
[64:35] just like having your own Keys yeah but
[64:38] even beyond that like that's going to be
[64:40] like I'm not even thinking about the
[64:43] self C like the technology and the te
[64:46] technical difficulty of it the part that
[64:49] con makes me not not not know what
[64:53] decision to make is because
[64:55] what concerns me more is the cost I
[64:58] think that the fees like you'll still be
[65:00] able to settle on chain but the fees are
[65:03] going to go up to a point where it's
[65:05] going to outprice people from being on
[65:08] chain like on chain is going to be a
[65:10] very that's going to be for very few
[65:14] even if even if the like yeah I think
[65:17] that that's a very touchy subject
[65:20] because I don't have a very confident
[65:24] opinion on what's going to happen
[65:26] I always consult uh people that I really
[65:29] respect when I don't have that much good
[65:32] of an opinion uh that much great of a
[65:35] knowledge on a specific subject in
[65:38] Bitcoin for me uh you Tak oh management
[65:42] and how many people will be able to
[65:44] actually transact on the base layer for
[65:47] me number one guy he is wicked I also
[65:49] had it on the podcast he makes great
[65:51] analysis on Twitter uh do you do you
[65:54] know him M uh he like he's really really
[65:57] a base guy like have him on the podcast
[65:59] oh wicked wicked yeah yeah yeah yeah
[66:01] yeah yeah yeah I know who you're talking
[66:02] about so what what did he say and he
[66:04] said uh that um on the base layer he
[66:09] thinks that not more than five to 10
[66:11] million institutions individual persons
[66:14] whatever the the thing is will be able
[66:16] to transact on a monthly Bas basis with
[66:19] each other M it's hard to exactly point
[66:22] the numbers it's 5 million or it 10
[66:23] million or 50 million how many
[66:25] institutions and people will be there
[66:27] but at some point the lowest person will
[66:31] be priced out because it will cost more
[66:34] to transact with it on the base layer
[66:37] than the actual value like we had to you
[66:40] have to pay thousands a toes to move
[66:42] move like 900 for S something like that
[66:44] like just to take a random example yeah
[66:47] so at some point people will be priced
[66:49] out of the base layer and will have to
[66:52] move to other Solutions is that thing
[66:54] about it excuse
[66:57] I'm not sure how this is going to happen
[66:59] but at some but yeah I mean it's just
[67:04] it's hard to think about it without
[67:06] compromising your privacy yes yeah so a
[67:09] lot of like what the system is going to
[67:12] rely on is some like traditional
[67:15] structures we're going to have like new
[67:17] Finance with some traditional structures
[67:20] and loss of privacy
[67:22] because um the high I mean unless we
[67:26] come up with a better second layer than
[67:28] the one we
[67:30] have that second layer like what he was
[67:32] saying is going to be the like interface
[67:36] between you and main chain and and
[67:38] onchain yes and and they are going
[67:42] to almost run a separate like
[67:46] transaction history and then settle that
[67:50] every so often on chain yes unless we I
[67:53] mean I hope we can find
[67:56] something that
[67:59] works more with the ethos of Bitcoin
[68:02] because the Bitcoin the big the of the
[68:05] onchain has some ethos that are really
[68:09] beautiful that so hopefully we can find
[68:11] something that doesn't step away from
[68:13] that as much as Lightning does cuz
[68:16] lightening it's not lightening that that
[68:19] does that but it's the fact that if the
[68:21] fees get high people won't be able to
[68:22] settle on chain so
[68:26] so hopefully we find a solution for that
[68:29] situation that allows people to still
[68:31] transact Because the actual Bitcoin
[68:34] ethos is is worth fighting for and I
[68:36] think that's why we're all here because
[68:38] that underlying technology or the the
[68:41] potential that each one of us sees in it
[68:44] like super makes us want to see it
[68:46] succeed and we're all just trying to
[68:48] figure out how we're going to overcome
[68:50] this and make it happen so it does
[68:52] happen because we want it to happen so
[68:54] bad
[68:56] yeah and uh it's interesting how how the
[68:59] Bitcoin Community evolves and it's
[69:02] amazing thank you for for being on these
[69:03] touched so many great subjects and it's
[69:06] such an amazing podcast where we could
[69:08] like make an own podcast about some
[69:10] subjects that we talk so thank you for
[69:13] being on uh for the people listening for
[69:15] the people watching now where can def
[69:17] find you where can def find your own
[69:18] podcast that you now started where can
[69:20] people reach out to you where can people
[69:22] ask you questions so we're on Twitter
[69:25] and Instagram and obviously on YouTube
[69:27] we're going to be putting the podcast
[69:29] out on Fountain as well I mean I'm I'm I
[69:32] just started so I still haven't built
[69:33] all the infrastructure but I do think
[69:35] we're going to do a Geer fund so that
[69:37] people can support the project and um
[69:41] the podcast is called
[69:43] Bitcoin which is bit coining in Spanish
[69:46] because I like the idea of uh learning
[69:49] by doing so I think uh so that's what
[69:51] the podcast is kind of oriented towards
[69:53] it's kind of like teaching thing people
[69:55] how to do the stuff so that they will
[69:57] get excited and uh have the initiative
[70:00] to kind of dive in and um yeah and on
[70:05] Twitter we're and on social media we're
[70:08] Bitcoin y with the number 21 at the end
