[00:00] once you realize about this whole
[00:02] situation you cannot unsee it they think
[00:04] El Salvador is a death trap like you go
[00:06] in you don't come out that's the whole
[00:08] the whole story this country was not fun
[00:11] before I literally live on a Bitcoin
[00:13] standard like every single day it's
[00:15] amazing now because of the fact that I
[00:19] realized this huge thing that I had no
[00:21] idea about it just opened the
[00:23] possibilities of well maybe there's a
[00:25] ton of other things that you haven't
[00:27] realized yet
[00:32] I haven't started the podcast in that
[00:35] way for a long time like in the
[00:37] beginning I always started like what's
[00:39] your Bitcoin story and why are you in
[00:41] Bitcoin uh but I think I did not do it
[00:43] for like 60 or 70 episodes but I was
[00:46] like maybe it could be interesting with
[00:48] you um why are you in Bitcoin why am I
[00:52] in Bitcoin yes why whoa that's like the
[00:56] biggest question ever like why
[01:01] what are you even doing here yeah
[01:03] exactly what do you even do here so um
[01:07] okay so long story short I was not a
[01:10] bitcoiner two years ago like I I you you
[01:15] know him so my my boyfriend Quenton
[01:17] right you I think you you know who he
[01:19] was on the podcast I think 70 episodes
[01:22] ago something like that yes because I I
[01:25] have like a daily podcast so he's
[01:28] probably like
[01:30] if you go like two three months back in
[01:31] my library you you probably can find him
[01:33] and maybe I think about it when I
[01:35] release it and and I put it somewhere
[01:37] here okay so people can also see the
[01:40] side perfect that would be good yeah
[01:42] because so he he's basically like he is
[01:46] basically what got me here so before
[01:49] before him I had heard about
[01:52] Bitcoin and but it was not like it was
[01:55] anything but a but a word to me really
[01:58] like Bitcoin was just award and I didn't
[02:00] know what it was and I had no idea um so
[02:04] yeah when when we met we met in Mexico
[02:07] he of course he's a bitcoiner like
[02:09] hardcore and everything but he he kept
[02:11] it pretty much to himself I want to say
[02:15] like he was not like oh let's like you
[02:18] should do this and you should do that
[02:19] like he was just I guess he was kind of
[02:23] like letting me figure it out by myself
[02:25] with the all the hints that he was
[02:27] giving me you know what I mean like he
[02:30] was not
[02:31] like yeah what I did the same thing with
[02:34] my girlfriend I think I the the I even
[02:38] didn't get got her hints like the first
[02:40] hints I dropped like at the second or
[02:42] third date or something like that
[02:44] because I don't want to scream everyone
[02:46] with Bitcoin because if if we get along
[02:49] then they will know about it anyways and
[02:52] and that's the way to go like seriously
[02:54] if if you know if someone tries to like
[02:57] impose something on you it's never going
[02:59] to work work like it's it's not or it
[03:02] probably it's going to work probably but
[03:04] it's not the same feeling of like oh I
[03:06] kind of want to do this it's more like
[03:08] oh well he wants me to do that and I'm
[03:10] with him so I'm just going to do it
[03:12] right like it's completely different so
[03:15] so yeah basically he got me into it kind
[03:18] of like
[03:21] indirectly and um and yeah and now so
[03:25] little by little I started just
[03:28] realizing uh how lost I've been before
[03:31] and how crazy the whole situation with
[03:34] money is that I had no idea about that I
[03:37] was just completely lost in this
[03:40] beautiful bubble of mine and it was good
[03:42] like I'm not complaining about it it was
[03:44] perfect but once you realize about this
[03:47] whole situation you cannot unsee it
[03:51] right so it wouldn't be it wouldn't be
[03:55] um how to say maybe it wouldn't be just
[04:00] easy for me to try to go back to my life
[04:04] before knowing about this whole
[04:06] situation economics social everything
[04:09] that Bitcoin kind of like entitles so
[04:13] that's why I'm here I'm here because I
[04:15] cannot unsee what I've seen and I don't
[04:19] want to like I refuse to take part in
[04:23] not doing anything so if if that means a
[04:28] better future for myself and probably my
[04:31] family because of course like I got them
[04:33] into it and everything so yeah that's
[04:36] that's basically the reason why I I
[04:38] would I would
[04:40] think what is um wrong with the this
[04:45] this thing where you lived in before in
[04:47] that bubble that you described the the
[04:49] thing where you once you un once you see
[04:52] it you cannot unsee it what what is what
[04:56] is the main thing that bothered you once
[04:58] you saw what is actually bothering you
[05:01] the one thing that made me gasped when I
[05:05] realized is the fact that there is no
[05:09] connection whatsoever with the printed
[05:11] money and the gold or whatever value
[05:15] they we used to have before like that
[05:17] there was a connection right you you had
[05:19] paper in the um how to say proportion to
[05:23] gold or whatever it was but um yeah when
[05:27] I when I learned and I realized that
[05:30] that was not true anymore and it hasn't
[05:33] been for quite some time that's what got
[05:35] me like what play are we playing like
[05:39] what is this how how does everyone
[05:44] keep um not realizing this and just
[05:48] silent about it because we don't really
[05:49] know so my bubble uh what I mentioned
[05:53] earlier was was basically that like I
[05:55] would just earn money um invest some
[05:58] money and like I have
[06:00] a friend of my mom she she works for
[06:02] like
[06:03] ASAP um insurance or something like that
[06:05] and they have like some um they have
[06:09] some I don't even know what's called I'm
[06:12] not sure what it is but anyway they can
[06:14] just invest your money and they give you
[06:16] revenue and blah blah so I had some
[06:18] money there and I just had this idea of
[06:22] well like you know I you you don't
[06:25] realize it's just paper you don't
[06:26] realize it's just the number on a on
[06:29] screen for example in digital numbers in
[06:32] my in my Mexican bank account you know
[06:34] like you don't realize all this and so
[06:37] once I realized I just cannot unsee
[06:43] it what is why do you think uh you did
[06:47] not see it before like for me it's
[06:48] always interesting how people actually
[06:50] got the Bitcoin and and what made them
[06:52] switch in the mind because this is also
[06:54] for me then a realization that maybe is
[06:57] a point where we should focus more in in
[07:00] educating like you always try to figure
[07:02] out like what what gets them to bitcoin
[07:05] because once they're in it they kind of
[07:07] find themselves like I'm also really
[07:10] passionate about uh learning people how
[07:12] to self custody how to do the utx O
[07:14] management and everything like that but
[07:17] there's a lot of material already out
[07:18] there and I feel like once they're in
[07:21] the Bitcoin room they will find their
[07:23] way do the uto management bar do the I
[07:26] don't
[07:28] know do the Sal Lot B like there s
[07:31] custody um because they see all the the
[07:34] content um but what's I think will
[07:37] trigger the masses like is is the entry
[07:41] point and for for most people it's like
[07:44] they hear Bitcoin over and over again
[07:46] and then they get get into this this
[07:48] Rabbit Hole um and and for you probably
[07:51] it was uh because someone that was
[07:55] really close to you kept uh like was was
[07:59] engaging with Bitcoin and it doesn't get
[08:01] really closer than the boyfriend
[08:03] but so so so that's that's that's the
[08:07] thing that but why do you think most
[08:10] people don't see it still it's kind of
[08:13] so obvious once you're in it yes um
[08:16] definitely is very obvious once you see
[08:18] it but then
[08:20] before so I am not sure why I kind of
[08:24] want to say it's just lack of lack of
[08:27] information and well maybe it's not the
[08:30] lack of information but it's just the
[08:32] lack
[08:34] of I don't know how to say it so when
[08:37] you live without realizing that the
[08:40] whole economic system is a scam you
[08:43] don't really W to dig into that rabbit
[08:47] hole right like you you're because
[08:49] you're fine or at least I was I was fine
[08:52] I I lived with my parents um before
[08:56] before coming to El Salvador I I I
[08:59] didn't have you know a greater worry and
[09:03] I think like most people my age for
[09:06] example they have a similar situation
[09:09] where yeah probably they need to pay I
[09:12] don't know probably college or I don't
[09:14] know a rent or whatever but it's not
[09:17] like oh I'm you know I'm in depth for uh
[09:21] 50 years like it's not it's not
[09:23] something crazy like that and so before
[09:29] um you it's kind of just comfortable to
[09:32] stay in that bubble and not seek for the
[09:37] truth or or just a a different theory
[09:41] about life or you know just anything
[09:43] like that because if you if you don't
[09:46] have the need for it then you're never
[09:49] going to seek for for anything else
[09:51] you're going to stay in your comfort
[09:52] zone and because it's just easy it's
[09:54] just it's just fun to to to keep living
[09:57] the life if it doesn't bother you but
[10:00] once it starts bothering you then you're
[10:03] going to seek for answers and probably
[10:06] like I said it's not lack of information
[10:09] because there's a lot of information out
[10:11] there but it's not in maybe it's in
[10:15] front of you but it's not something that
[10:17] you seek so it's not something that you
[10:18] see you know how there's like this I
[10:21] don't know if it's a theory or or what
[10:23] what is it but it's like when you for
[10:25] example say you want to get a car and
[10:28] you say like oh I kind of like this car
[10:31] and it's like the Toyota whatever I
[10:32] don't know I don't know about cars but
[10:34] whatever and so now that you decided you
[10:36] want that car you see it everywhere and
[10:39] it's like oh like there it is and there
[10:41] it is and you've never seen it before
[10:42] but you see it everywhere now in your
[10:44] neighborhood and in the street like
[10:46] everywhere and it's because your mind
[10:48] literally
[10:50] Focus uh like your mind focuses on that
[10:53] thing that you want and that thing that
[10:54] you're seeking so it's the same thing so
[10:57] like now I just see this scam
[11:00] everywhere and I cannot unsee it right
[11:03] that's that's the thing yeah man is I
[11:06] mean this say nothing to do with Bitcoin
[11:08] but our mind is really spectacular
[11:09] because most of the things we're doing
[11:12] is completely blacked out uh and there's
[11:16] this popular video where you see people
[11:19] dancing and in then was like Hey focus
[11:21] on the people that are dancing yeah uh
[11:23] and then there's an elephant going
[11:26] through that video and then like did you
[11:29] saw that elephant and then you replay
[11:32] and like oh [ __ ] there's an elephant
[11:33] like where did he come from I did not
[11:36] see him the first time uh and the same
[11:39] is like uh with awareness and and that
[11:41] that's where what I think also that
[11:43] where it's coming from because if you
[11:45] don't have and and saor puts it so good
[11:47] like it's really hard to not quote
[11:50] him he says like if you have a need to
[11:53] know about Bitcoin then you will know
[11:55] about Bitcoin like the pain is not high
[11:57] enough for most people
[12:00] um El Salvador had a need to know about
[12:02] Bitcoin because they had a major major
[12:04] problem that's why they needed to know
[12:06] about Bitcoin uh Donald Trump Even Now
[12:10] with uh the election he had a need to
[12:12] know about Bitcoin not financially but
[12:14] he needed the votes of the Bitcoin and
[12:17] that's why he discovered Bitcoin I'm
[12:20] fairly certain if Donald Trump was not
[12:22] candidating for the US Presidency he
[12:25] probably would not discover Bitcoin
[12:26] because he doesn't need it financially
[12:29] exactly uh and that that's where I think
[12:32] awareness comes in and that's the car
[12:34] example is also amazing because once you
[12:35] buy one car you see it
[12:38] everywhere or or once you're like
[12:40] thinking of a car or a friend of you
[12:42] gets a car and and then you see it
[12:44] everywhere it's just the awareness uh
[12:46] that that that all of the sudden comes
[12:48] in but you also told me that you are uh
[12:51] teaching English uh so so so what are
[12:54] you doing uh or maybe let's back up a
[12:57] little bit where are you actually coming
[12:59] from from because you did not grew up in
[13:01] Salvador no I I grew up in Mexico my
[13:04] family is Mexican I grew up in Mexico I
[13:09] that's basically my whole life until I
[13:11] was 18 I moved to Canada for a year and
[13:16] a half something like that and that was
[13:19] Co time so I mean like right when Co
[13:23] started I went back to Mexico and um and
[13:26] that's it I kind of stayed for the whole
[13:28] pandemic and everything and
[13:30] then and then back in
[13:33] 2021 I believe that's when I met my
[13:36] boyfriend and we started traveling
[13:38] together and that's when we arrived to
[13:40] elabor there was a lot of time in
[13:43] between actually staying and kind of
[13:45] moving to El Salvador we are now we are
[13:48] here now um but there was yeah a couple
[13:51] of years but um yeah so that's that's
[13:55] where I come from I I always like my
[13:58] whole home because it's my parents house
[14:01] where I always lived that's in in
[14:04] Mexico okay how did you decide I mean I
[14:07] think uh I talked a little bit uh with
[14:10] Quenton about it but why did you move uh
[14:14] then D Salvador so basically we were we
[14:19] were traveling so he came from France
[14:22] and he was just traveling around Mexico
[14:24] he didn't have uh any intention of
[14:28] working or anything like that so he was
[14:29] just traveling for like 6 months and
[14:32] after 6 months passed he decided he
[14:34] wanted to stay so we kept traveling and
[14:36] we went all the way to Guatemala we
[14:39] discovered Guatemala it was beautiful
[14:41] country and then um so this is around
[14:44] the time where I was not a bitcoiner at
[14:48] all yet like he kept telling me that we
[14:51] should go like keep going back to
[14:53] Salvador because he wanted to know what
[14:56] what what it was like what was happening
[14:57] in El Salvador and and I almost killed
[15:01] him when he told me that he wanted to go
[15:03] to Salvador because I was like bro like
[15:05] do you know what you're going to like
[15:07] because like before and and today even
[15:11] like everybody in Latin America and
[15:14] probably the rest of the world too they
[15:16] think El Salvador is a de trap like you
[15:18] go in you don't you don't come out
[15:21] that's that's the whole the whole story
[15:23] like it's it's horrible the story and so
[15:27] when he told me like no but like there's
[15:29] there's bit like something happening
[15:31] around Bitcoin blah blah and I'm like
[15:33] yeah um I don't know like I don't think
[15:36] so and it took a while for me to to
[15:39] decide that I that okay I kind of want
[15:41] to go with you and let's let's see what
[15:44] we can
[15:45] find and so when we yeah we arrived and
[15:49] yeah I like it just it was right in
[15:52] front of my eyes like the the country is
[15:55] so safe it's uh it's beautiful it's so
[15:59] new and everything is just developing
[16:03] for for uh for becoming a great country
[16:05] and so we we did some back and forth we
[16:09] didn't move right uh right then we just
[16:12] uh we were visiting we traveled around
[16:15] El Salvador and then we kept going back
[16:18] to Mexico uh and coming back so few
[16:20] months in Mexico few months in El
[16:22] Salvador and so finally um John from my
[16:26] first Bitcoin he offered Quenton the the
[16:29] project of taking charge of laaya Island
[16:31] which is what the first like our first
[16:35] project to say like okay we're moving to
[16:37] salad because it was a six-month project
[16:40] so it was like okay so we need to be
[16:41] there at least for six months um but we
[16:44] didn't really think about going back to
[16:47] Mexico after we were just like okay so
[16:49] we're starting there and we'll see we'll
[16:50] go from there and so yeah that that
[16:54] project or we left the island back in
[16:57] October last year and we moved to Berlin
[17:01] uhan
[17:03] now and the first time you arrived you
[17:06] still kind of thought I might die here
[17:09] or um let's see let's let let me
[17:13] remember a little bit so first time I
[17:19] arrived not really I was definitely
[17:22] skeptical so we arrived uh by bus from
[17:27] Guatemala
[17:30] yes we crossed the border by buz and we
[17:32] arrived to the region that's called
[17:35] Santana in
[17:36] Salvador and I remember that so we we
[17:41] booked an Airbnb or something I don't I
[17:44] don't really remember how we got it
[17:46] because there's a a lack of of social
[17:49] media like you cannot do like in Mexico
[17:51] I just did everything from my phone like
[17:53] I just book this place book that place
[17:55] whatever BL that and here it's it's it's
[17:57] getting there but some work to do um so
[18:01] anyway we we found a place to to stay
[18:04] and I remember that I would like we
[18:07] would go out at night to to grab dinner
[18:10] or whatever and I would be so nervous
[18:13] like I remember walking on the streets
[18:15] like holding his hand just being like
[18:17] please like just praying like nothing's
[18:20] gonna happen to us because I had that
[18:22] idea of pH Salvador and I think like if
[18:26] I was nervous my mom back in Mexico she
[18:28] was dying like she couldn't believe I
[18:32] was in El Salvador discovering this new
[18:34] country and she crazy but yeah so
[18:37] basically I I was still very skeptical
[18:40] about this whole thing and uh not
[18:42] Bitcoin like I really didn't have much
[18:45] idea about what was going on with
[18:47] Bitcoin but the fact of like it's safe
[18:50] now like you can be okay um and I was
[18:53] not I didn't want to believe it until I
[18:56] actually saw it so so so yeah I was a
[19:00] little skeptical first in Santana like
[19:03] at night especially but I mean nothing
[19:05] ever happened of course um there was
[19:08] this one time where we were in Santana
[19:11] and we we went for dinner or something
[19:14] at night and we had to go back to the
[19:16] house and we were supposed to cross like
[19:19] this street market so I don't know if
[19:22] you know about this or if it's if
[19:23] there's anything like that where you
[19:25] live but in El Salvador and most Latin
[19:28] America there's a lot of mercados so
[19:30] like this like big Market that they are
[19:32] there all the time and just people you
[19:34] know wrap their things up and they leave
[19:36] and they come back the next day and they
[19:38] sell their stuff but usually the markets
[19:42] at night they're very
[19:45] scary because it's just like tense and
[19:48] like old uh and this is everywhere not
[19:51] just here like in Mexico I I would never
[19:54] cross like go walk by a market at night
[19:56] because I just like give me Goosebumps
[19:59] but um so anyway we had to cross like
[20:03] literally go inside the market to to
[20:06] arrive home the fastest way and I
[20:09] remember I was C like I was cursing the
[20:12] whole time I was so scared that
[20:15] something was like someone was going to
[20:17] jump on on us like I knew we were gonna
[20:20] get robbed something like I just knew
[20:22] that it was not going to be okay but I
[20:25] mean nothing happened it was just a
[20:27] scary looking market and that's it but
[20:29] there was yeah there was no danger
[20:31] whatsoever and that just kept going uh
[20:34] all the way so we we traveled around El
[20:37] Salvador we I don't want to say we know
[20:41] every place because we don't but we know
[20:43] a bunch of them and yeah we we I felt
[20:47] very safe uh most of the time so yeah it
[20:51] was it was okay how long are you now in
[20:54] total in Salvador sorry how how long are
[20:58] you in El Salvador now uh we've been
[21:01] here so we
[21:02] arrived in oh my God I don't know we've
[21:06] been here for a year uh like stayed like
[21:10] moved a year ago and then before that it
[21:13] was like I don't know we traveled for
[21:15] six months or something around
[21:18] Salvador how did this uh how did this
[21:21] Salvador because there was a big shift
[21:23] when uh he announced Bitcoin then there
[21:25] was a big shift when he kind of got rid
[21:28] of the game
[21:29] um how did this after the gangs and
[21:33] after they did the Bitcoin thing uh prog
[21:37] when was this with the gangs I think it
[21:38] was last year or the day the year before
[21:41] I don't remember exactly uh but how did
[21:44] Salvador now evolve because it's like
[21:47] they're doing also the the passports now
[21:49] he got re reelected I think what what I
[21:53] what I see it's it's fascinating how
[21:54] much information I actually have about
[21:56] El Salvador even though it's such a
[21:58] small country uh except for for Bitcoin
[22:01] of course but how how does how did sa do
[22:04] you think progressed in in the last like
[22:07] year where where you were here did you
[22:09] noticed any differences I heard from
[22:12] other people like when they first came
[22:14] there were still a lot of security
[22:16] guards at the supermarkets then the
[22:18] security guard guards got less because
[22:20] it got safer and and those kind of
[22:22] things did you did you notice uh
[22:24] anything honestly no um I I think we
[22:29] arrived when all that had already
[22:32] happened uh when Bitcoin happened and
[22:35] with uh the getting R getting rid of the
[22:38] gangs happened so I don't have anything
[22:43] specific that I noticed in the past year
[22:46] or two um but what I can say is that
[22:51] ever since I arrived I remember I just
[22:54] keep asking people about like local
[22:56] people about their life and how has that
[22:59] changed and I always get the same answer
[23:02] and it's it's crazy because for example
[23:04] back in San Salvador we we never lived
[23:08] there we just we were there for a week
[23:10] or so uh several times but back in s
[23:13] Salvador we would take like an an Uber
[23:16] or like a taxi or whatever and and I
[23:19] remember I I would ask the the driver
[23:22] like how how do you feel now like what
[23:25] has changed like I just wanted to know
[23:27] the the local perspective because we
[23:29] always hear foreigners and how amazing
[23:32] this this uh new country is and Bitcoin
[23:35] blah blah but I mean I kind of want to
[23:37] know the the local story right so they
[23:42] yeah most of them they would tell me
[23:44] that they feel happy and it's so good
[23:47] that it's uh you know it's safe and it's
[23:50] amazing but most of them don't really
[23:53] know what to do with it with their time
[23:56] because before
[23:59] they would try and work and work if they
[24:03] can and then just go back and literally
[24:05] lock themselves in their houses because
[24:08] you you were not like I mean you could
[24:10] go out but then I mean good luck right
[24:13] like it was not it was not a thing you
[24:15] do um back back in the day so now they
[24:20] the Uber driver I remember he he was
[24:22] telling me like yeah like now I I'm just
[24:24] working more hours like he was Uber
[24:27] right he that's job so he's like I'm
[24:29] just picking up more more um more rides
[24:34] cuz before like I don't know it was
[24:36] sunset and I needed to rush home and not
[24:39] get out and now it was like 9:00 p.m.
[24:42] when when we took this ride and and he's
[24:44] like now I just stay on the street I
[24:46] make more money and like I don't really
[24:48] know what to
[24:49] do so so yeah that is something that
[24:53] definitely needs attention I would say
[24:57] because uh cuz yeah this country
[24:58] country was not fun before you know and
[25:02] and we need the fun now they need the
[25:06] fun now so I think it would be amazing
[25:10] and and of course it's it's happening
[25:12] like little by little it's gonna it's
[25:13] going to grow and it's going to develop
[25:15] a little more but I think the the
[25:18] leisure activities are going to go wild
[25:21] because people need that they they they
[25:24] haven't had that for 30 plus years you
[25:26] know so that's going to I think that's a
[25:29] good opportunity for them and for us if
[25:33] you know foreigners that we want to come
[25:35] and live here will then at least try and
[25:38] make it good for for
[25:40] locals so good opportunity to go down
[25:43] there side I would then open my Bitcoin
[25:44] bar yeah exactly well you know like in
[25:47] this little town where we live in Berlin
[25:50] um there's there's a bunch of young
[25:54] people so there's a lot of kids I mean
[25:56] and and kids and and um teenagers and
[25:59] just young and they don't have a a disco
[26:05] like a disco Tech or a bar I mean not
[26:07] that they could drink or anything but
[26:09] they don't have anywhere to actually
[26:11] spend their time with their friends like
[26:12] it's there is not a a a how to say like
[26:17] a yeah common hangout place yes yes a
[26:20] place to hang out exactly I mean there's
[26:22] coffee shops some of them but I mean you
[26:24] kind of want to have fun with your with
[26:26] your friends right when you're that age
[26:28] and um so every I don't know once a
[26:32] month or maybe twice a month if if it's
[26:35] a busy month there's like
[26:38] the the discos that's how they call they
[26:41] call it uh how do they call it oh my God
[26:45] I forgot well it's it's this like
[26:48] removable disco Tech so it's like a tent
[26:51] like a very big one it depends of course
[26:53] on how much budget you have so they have
[26:56] like this tense with like a music like a
[26:58] DJ and music and crazy um speakers and
[27:03] all these things and so it's because if
[27:05] there's a party if there's a celebration
[27:07] well then someone's gonna hire this I
[27:09] don't know what the what their name is I
[27:11] forgot but anyway it's just like the
[27:13] Disco thing and and you would see it
[27:18] crowded like everybody goes because of
[27:21] course that's your only chance to go and
[27:24] dance and have fun and that's it there's
[27:28] no other place so once a month or twice
[27:30] a month or whatever whenever that the
[27:32] Disco comes it's like a full thing so it
[27:36] is it is very funny because yeah they
[27:38] don't have that other
[27:41] opportunity I love it are there
[27:44] playgrounds for kids like where where
[27:46] they they have like an an slide or
[27:48] something like
[27:50] that
[27:51] um because I'm I I I see it now I was
[27:55] before in a village in Austria where
[27:58] there was a playground but you could
[27:59] have like you you went there like 3
[28:03] kilometers 2 kilometers or something
[28:04] like that to the next playground because
[28:06] it was so upside from from all the the
[28:10] rest of the village but now I live in
[28:12] Vienna with my girlfriend here and there
[28:15] is literally a playground everywhere
[28:17] like I have probably four or five
[28:20] playgrounds in reach of like seven or
[28:23] eight minutes of walks uh it's it's
[28:25] beautiful because there you can like
[28:27] there
[28:29] kids really young kids playing on the
[28:32] slides then they are like a little bit
[28:34] older teenager 20 25 with the table
[28:37] tennis with the basketball courts and
[28:39] everything like it's a really nice place
[28:41] and I love it and and I also spend a lot
[28:43] of the time there some like oh I just
[28:45] want to go out and I go to the
[28:47] playground
[28:50] slide yeah I'm two meters so like the
[28:53] slides
[28:54] is it looks funny when I'm on a slide
[28:57] because like I did not
[28:59] leave there but I'm already down so like
[29:02] you're actually wait how high like
[29:04] what's your height I'm I'm 2 meters
[29:06] actually yeah like seriously like I'm
[29:10] I'm 2 cm under 2 meters so like
[29:13] 198 what I'm like 160 or
[29:17] something
[29:19] whoa then a inperson podcast would be
[29:22] way more fun of course I'll be like well
[29:25] Robin
[29:29] absolutely yeah so uh to answer your
[29:32] question there are some places for kids
[29:36] to hang out so I'm gonna talk about
[29:38] Berlin only because s Salvador it's a
[29:41] big city I'm sure there's a lot of
[29:43] things but I don't know anything about
[29:45] it but um
[29:47] Berlin um there's for example in the
[29:49] main Square so like the you have the
[29:52] church and you have the main square of
[29:54] the town and that's like the the city
[29:56] center let's say um um there is a a
[30:00] small playground there's like some
[30:01] slides and like some things for kids and
[30:04] then also there's two um so there's like
[30:09] some basketball courts down down the
[30:13] well whatever it's just here in the city
[30:15] but it's somewhere downwards and
[30:19] somewhere up so this is a m mountain
[30:21] town I don't know if you if you knew but
[30:23] we're like up in the mountain so
[30:25] everything is like uphill downhill and
[30:27] that's how you kind of get the grasp of
[30:29] of where you are so downhill there's the
[30:32] basketball courts and Uphill there's a
[30:34] very big um soccer court and it's like
[30:38] three or four there's a basketball court
[30:40] too and yeah there's there's places
[30:42] there's definitely places and and I'm
[30:44] happy there there's some places because
[30:46] um yeah that's that's so good and
[30:49] they're like most of um most of the time
[30:53] are there's there's people there so
[30:55] there's like kids playing or like team
[30:57] teenagers just uh you know bouncing the
[31:00] ball whatever so yeah it's it's really
[31:02] nice but um I still I still think that
[31:07] there there's a need for more of these
[31:10] places and and different kind of places
[31:12] like that
[31:14] absolutely it's so important
[31:17] for for place to have those hangout
[31:21] places to have those playgrounds uh bars
[31:25] coffees like uh I don't know if you know
[31:28] Vienna's history and culture but there's
[31:31] a lot of coffee and uh sitting in a
[31:35] Coffee Culture like there is probably
[31:38] like but in El Salvador it's also big
[31:40] right it's because I think El Salvador
[31:43] also like kind of connect with coffee
[31:45] yes this is a coffee country uh coffee
[31:49] and caca a little bit too and uh corn of
[31:54] course that's like their main Cacao is
[31:57] not the main
[31:58] the main crops or anything but coffee
[32:00] and corn for
[32:02] sure I'm I'm famous for uh when when
[32:05] everyone has a coffee I have the caca
[32:08] I'm I'm I'm that small kid it's like oh
[32:11] please a hot chocolate for me yes for
[32:13] sure every time every time well you know
[32:16] Cacao is is so good for you like it has
[32:19] so much uh it has so many properties of
[32:23] um to your like nutritious properties
[32:25] for your body so of course if you mix up
[32:28] with like tons of sugar well then you
[32:30] kind of you kind of
[32:32] lose yeah that that's always the thing
[32:35] like the the normal cacao would be
[32:38] really good but then you get it in this
[32:41] processed thing and there's so much
[32:43] sugar in there and I still I love it
[32:46] like but it's it it it it's it's tasty
[32:49] it's a sweet but it's not something uh
[32:52] healthier I would say for sure yeah no
[32:56] that's that's something that we
[32:57] definitely Ely um like we we have we can
[33:01] relate to because the other day um my
[33:06] boyfriend he so we have access I have
[33:10] access to this lady that has some cacao
[33:13] farm and it's like she grows she grows
[33:16] it them uh herself and it's really nice
[33:18] it's really nice and so I got some I
[33:21] toasted it in like in the gal thing so
[33:25] like in a little pan you want to say
[33:28] um and I I I did the whole process for
[33:31] me to be able for us to be able to eat
[33:33] it and just have it you know in our
[33:35] pantry so the other day uh Quenton he
[33:39] and we also have access to raw milk it's
[33:43] a local milk or local cows here in the
[33:45] town and a lady sells raw milk so I
[33:49] usually walk up there and I get some and
[33:51] I come back and so one day I was
[33:54] teaching a lesson and Quenton comes with
[33:56] a with with a with a glass of something
[33:59] like it looked like a milkshake or
[34:01] something and I and I was like okay I
[34:03] tried it and it was this amazing drink
[34:07] so it was like raw milk organic cacao
[34:12] like pure cacao and honey and so it was
[34:16] this like thick
[34:19] amazing delicious drink and it's like
[34:23] sweet it was not bitter or anything
[34:25] because of the honey and it was so good
[34:27] it was that good that we decided to
[34:29] start selling it at the farmers market
[34:31] when when we have it here in Berlin and
[34:35] that's actually tomorrow so I'm gonna be
[34:37] roasting some cacao today um but yeah it
[34:40] was so good and and it's it's our it's
[34:43] the perfect substitution for a hot choco
[34:47] or a cold uh choco milk you know like
[34:51] it's so good thank you you already made
[34:53] it halfway through the video and I'm
[34:55] really really grateful to have you here
[34:57] two things make this channel possible
[35:00] you as a watcher and listener who keep
[35:02] supporting this Channel and another one
[35:05] is all the Bitcoin brands that I partner
[35:07] up with like 21 Bitcoin who support me
[35:10] from the very start and where I
[35:11] personally buy my Bitcoin from with code
[35:13] Robin you even get a discount when you
[35:15] buy Bitcoin with them and now also
[35:18] bitbox bitbox is the simplest and
[35:20] securest way to secure your Bitcoin and
[35:23] I heard a crazy statistics only 2% of
[35:26] bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin in a
[35:28] hardware wallet how crazy is that don't
[35:30] be in that 98% bracket be in the 2%
[35:34] bracket and if you have self- custody
[35:36] and you know your friend does not have
[35:38] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[35:40] he needs a birthday present and a small
[35:42] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[35:44] 5% off your order plus you support my
[35:48] channel and now let's get back to the
[35:50] video with no I really want to try it
[35:52] now unfortunately now now I really
[35:55] regret that it's not an inperson podcast
[36:00] yeah you well you know that's that's
[36:02] another reason for you to
[36:03] visit that's it yeah there there's
[36:06] always like when have not I probably
[36:08] done like 10 or 15 podcasts at this
[36:11] point with with people from El Salvador
[36:13] or people who move to El Salvador and
[36:16] the one thing that I always come out is
[36:19] like oh [ __ ] I I actually have to visit
[36:21] El Sal at some point um there's the
[36:24] conference in in November so I might go
[36:27] there um but it's it's not like I I will
[36:30] do it probably really spontaneous like I
[36:33] will say like oh two weeks to the
[36:35] conference let's let's let's go take a
[36:37] plan let's take a plane tomorrow and and
[36:40] you know that's the way to go like if
[36:41] you're not if you're not really planning
[36:44] on like moving or anything just just
[36:46] come for like a week or two weeks I mean
[36:49] it's a it's a long flight so maybe two
[36:51] weeks would be would be best but um but
[36:54] yeah on on on November for example
[36:56] there's going to be a ton of different
[36:59] events happening around El Salvador not
[37:01] just the adopting Bitcoin conference but
[37:03] like there's going to be a festival here
[37:06] in Berlin there going to be the in
[37:08] elante like Bitcoin Beach they have a
[37:10] whole I think they have a conference
[37:13] they have parties and stuff in Salvador
[37:15] and everywhere like seriously it's going
[37:17] to be a busy busy week and um and yeah
[37:21] if you if you ever found yourself here
[37:24] just make sure you visit and I'll make
[37:26] some kak drink for you oh amazing I I
[37:31] already love it I I just saw I want to
[37:33] see now how how long it actually the
[37:35] flight is I'm just looking it up look it
[37:37] up I'm curious It's probably like 10
[37:39] hours around that time you said you were
[37:41] in Austria Austria yes it's like middle
[37:44] of Europe so like Germany it's GNA yeah
[37:47] I know where Austria
[37:50] is really I mean I I don't know Austria
[37:53] is such a small country it is it is very
[37:56] small yeah I've never
[37:58] I but but what do you know about Austria
[38:00] no I just I just see it on the map
[38:03] that's
[38:05] it maybe you have some some knowledge
[38:08] that I don't even have yeah I know about
[38:11] Vienna and the song I Love the song
[38:13] that's it
[38:15] that's yeah Vienna
[38:17] has Austria in has actually a lot of
[38:21] history a lot of really good history
[38:23] also connected with son money austan
[38:25] economics uh High and and and and so on
[38:29] they are from Austria so like it's it's
[38:32] really
[38:33] interesting uh I got that reest already
[38:36] for like two three people that I go to
[38:39] Old buildings from Austria that are
[38:43] there for like so many hundreds of
[38:44] thousands of years and then make some
[38:47] history about that connected with
[38:49] Bitcoin connected with some money
[38:50] connected with a gold standard and stuff
[38:52] like that that would be really fun but I
[38:54] I think I need like a solid one two days
[38:57] for one video about that because I have
[38:59] to do so much research I have to find
[39:00] the places and everything um but Austria
[39:04] is fascinating and and and Vienna is a
[39:06] really good except taxes and bureaucracy
[39:12] and all the things that coming from the
[39:13] state is really nice like uh the
[39:15] infrastructure is amazing you can go
[39:17] with the public transport everywhere uh
[39:20] and it's really quick you have clean
[39:22] water everywhere and you don't have to
[39:24] buy the water from the store because
[39:25] there's actually clean water and
[39:26] everything coming out from from the
[39:28] normal water things and from the tap
[39:31] yeah and there's a lot of things I
[39:34] travel a lot and when I go outside of
[39:36] Austria um I never been to Salvador but
[39:38] when I go outside of Austria even to
[39:41] other European countries I miss some of
[39:44] the amazing FRS from Austria even like
[39:47] the train system for example is really
[39:49] good like all the trains are really nice
[39:51] then I go to a train in some other
[39:52] countries I'm like oh yes it smells bad
[39:56] it's it's like it's hot in the summer
[39:58] and cold in the winter like Austra has
[40:01] some amazing features to itself but B
[40:05] way too high taxes and a lot of
[40:07] bureaucracy that you have to fight for
[40:10] yeah no I I completely understand I
[40:13] completely understand because I have the
[40:15] same feeling with Mexico um a complete
[40:18] different things so I don't miss a train
[40:21] I don't miss any of those things I don't
[40:24] miss the Clean Water uh but I for
[40:26] example when I go out and I travel I
[40:29] just I just cannot wait to go back and
[40:32] eat Mexican food like real Mexican food
[40:35] and I'm talking like my grandma's
[40:37] Cuisine you know like that that type of
[40:38] food and and it's just yeah it's just
[40:41] the way it is like I I completely
[40:43] understand how you can
[40:45] appreciate your country so much more
[40:48] when you're not in there
[40:50] right yeah definitely and Mexican food
[40:53] is really good also like I can
[40:55] understand that
[40:58] yeah no it's really good I love it
[41:00] that's that's the one thing I do miss uh
[41:02] being here in Salvador like here you
[41:04] know it's great like I there's I have
[41:07] the the safety and the the access to
[41:11] just not having dollars at all like I
[41:14] literally live on a Bitcoin standard
[41:16] like every single day it's amazing but
[41:19] um yeah I miss Mexican food um it's it's
[41:23] something that I cry for every day
[41:28] but that that's uh that's a good uh
[41:31] thing because you said you live on a
[41:32] Bitcoin standard so like you earn also
[41:34] in
[41:35] Bitcoin uh no actually no that's the
[41:38] that's the one thing so I um I've been
[41:42] an English teacher I work on a platform
[41:45] that's called preply and I've been doing
[41:48] that for like four years and um that's
[41:51] like Fiat money that's it I I tried so
[41:56] some people here in Berlin that I know
[41:59] Evelyn and hero oh Evelyn right you know
[42:01] her yeah I had herard and Evelyn uh and
[42:06] your boyfriend already on so it's like
[42:10] my broadcast is also the the family
[42:11] gathering of El Salvador yeah right we
[42:15] have to make one with all of them it
[42:17] would be so good yeah actually um but I
[42:21] want to visit a Sal it's just a matter
[42:23] of time and it would be so amazing
[42:26] because also that you have podcast
[42:27] Studios to get like all of you maybe
[42:31] it's not possible because we need a lot
[42:32] of microphones then but get all of you
[42:35] in in a room and make like one one big
[42:38] uh family gathering yeah that would be
[42:40] so much fun like even we could do like a
[42:43] girls podcast and then boys or something
[42:45] like that would be so much fun I would
[42:47] love that would be that would be a lot
[42:49] of fun and there was already yeah only
[42:53] the only the girls are already like five
[42:56] like yeah what I have yeah yeah because
[42:59] I don't know if I can I have to make I
[43:01] will do it uh because I want to do my
[43:03] Bitcoin uh podcast as a library I want
[43:06] to collect it better because I have not
[43:08] cread any playlists till now except like
[43:12] the inperson playlist with Bitcoin prag
[43:14] and stuff like that but uh I did not do
[43:17] a topic playlist and it would be great
[43:18] to just have like an El Salvador
[43:20] playlist and you can watch all my
[43:22] podcast interviews that I have done with
[43:23] people from El Salvador uh and then like
[43:26] oh there's takes be careful you're
[43:29] saying it so you have to do it now
[43:31] people are going to expect this from
[43:34] you so so I have till I uploaded like a
[43:37] week time so
[43:40] yeah exactly no but that's such a good
[43:43] idea I would I would actually love to
[43:46] participate or even just watch that that
[43:48] would be amazing it would be so good I
[43:50] mean participating uh you def definitely
[43:53] because your podcast will be in the in
[43:56] the the
[43:59] playlist uh and yeah it would be Oh you
[44:01] mean the inperson podcast yes uh that
[44:03] would be really fun I would love that
[44:06] yeah but we probably would have to break
[44:08] it up in like two or three different
[44:10] sections yeah I think
[44:12] so it's a bunch of us here so that's
[44:14] gonna be interesting or or make like
[44:16] rabbit uh rabbit uh how is it called I
[44:21] only know that where where you have like
[44:24] um there's like a special format where
[44:27] you have like a hot t hot uh one chair
[44:31] and there's someone in there for like 5
[44:33] 10 minutes and then the next one comes
[44:35] um oh my God it's like for dating you
[44:38] would call it like I oh no no a
[44:41] different uh it's not speed dating oh
[44:44] okay that was thinking about because uh
[44:47] uh the for me the the thing for Speed
[44:50] Dating is like there are like two sides
[44:51] of the tables and they all move the
[44:54] whole time and everyone has a different
[44:56] one uh the the one I thought is like
[44:58] there's one chair and then you come in
[45:01] have like five minutes of interview like
[45:03] a really quick one and then the next one
[45:05] and the next one I forgot like hot chair
[45:09] it's there there's some concept around
[45:11] that it would be interesting but uh I'm
[45:14] I'm not a fan of of um quick
[45:17] conversation that's why I do a long form
[45:19] podcast that is defin yes of course you
[45:21] would be like so trivial like it's it's
[45:25] not doesn't have the juice of a long
[45:27] conversation right yeah it's it's the
[45:30] podcast usually gets better after 20
[45:34] minutes like the first 10 20 minutes I
[45:38] try to make it as good as possible
[45:40] that's why I also don't ask my guest oh
[45:43] hello yeah Sam please introduce yourself
[45:46] like I think that's so boring yeah like
[45:50] come up come up with an interesting
[45:51] question I agree to totally agree yeah
[45:55] but do you remember like 20 minutes ago
[45:57] when I I wanted to ask you about English
[46:00] teaching English teaching and then I
[46:03] kind of went on a different
[46:04] route because of my note uh note uh apps
[46:08] that I also have open I did not forget
[46:11] um so you are teaching English and
[46:13] that's what you also teach with with
[46:15] your feat pay is is that the only thing
[46:16] that you are doing currently no so
[46:19] that's the that was my main job for the
[46:22] past four years but now um I just
[46:27] launched a Spanish course so now I am
[46:31] doing Spanish as well we I did this 21
[46:35] lesson course and it's it's it's funny
[46:39] it I really enjoyed crafting it and
[46:42] making it because it is very focused on
[46:46] Salvadorian Spanish which is not my
[46:49] Spanish so I speak Mexican Spanish and
[46:53] for like it's not a different language
[46:56] or anything
[46:57] but it has so many different words and
[47:01] different expressions and just things
[47:03] that we don't use in Mexico for example
[47:07] uh or me things that we use in Mexico
[47:09] they're not used here
[47:12] so wait is it just the spoken language
[47:15] for example in Austria and Germany they
[47:17] both have German as a
[47:19] language and but the written form is the
[47:23] same thing but when we speak it there is
[47:26] a dialect and there's also more words to
[47:29] it there different words to it and
[47:32] sometimes we speak words so differently
[47:35] that you even don't even know that the
[47:36] word is actually from there like is the
[47:39] Mexican and the Salvadorian Spanish just
[47:43] the the speaking different or is it
[47:45] actually like a there different words
[47:47] also when you write it there's
[47:49] definitely a ton of different words but
[47:53] these are like slang words you know so
[47:57] so uh for example if like with me like a
[48:02] Mexican girl who comes to El Salvador
[48:04] everybody's gonna understand what she's
[48:06] saying and she's gonna understand
[48:07] everything that everybody else is saying
[48:09] it's not like a like a to totally
[48:12] different language or anything like that
[48:13] but um when when you pay attention or
[48:17] when you've been here for quite some
[48:19] time you realize a lot of words that you
[48:22] have said they have no idea what they
[48:24] are and a lot of words that they have
[48:26] said you don't understand whatsoever
[48:28] because it's different words words that
[48:30] I never heard before so when making this
[48:34] course so this this whole thing like
[48:36] this whole Spanish course the idea um
[48:40] started with everybody in Berlin uh
[48:44] foreigners in Berlin just coming and
[48:47] trying to learn Spanish that um they
[48:50] would always like just ask me for like a
[48:53] like come here and like uh help me in
[48:56] the mark Market with this you know like
[48:58] I just want to buy some things and like
[49:00] can you be my translator or whatever so
[49:02] I just um I realized that it would be a
[49:04] good opportunity for me to craft a
[49:07] Spanish course that targets like
[49:10] situational Spanish like you actually
[49:14] the things that you actually use it's
[49:15] not the same thing to take Spanish
[49:17] course or take Spanish class and yeah
[49:19] it's going to be good it's G to give you
[49:20] the basics or whatever but my my course
[49:23] it's uh it's that it's 21 lessons and
[49:27] each lesson is a situation so like
[49:30] literally shopping at the market like uh
[49:32] getting food and paying in Bitcoin uh
[49:35] traveling around like discovering and
[49:38] those things so it is uh it is very fun
[49:42] like it was very fun doing it because I
[49:46] at at the end of each lesson I included
[49:50] one Salvadorian word and these words
[49:55] were were the ones that I had to ask
[49:58] around and and really know in which
[50:01] context you will use them like exactly
[50:04] what they what do they mean um like all
[50:06] these things and uh and so yeah it's
[50:08] it's really funny and now because I I've
[50:12] I've um just you know crafted my way
[50:16] around Salvadorian Spanish now I
[50:19] improved my Salvador in Spanish so
[50:23] people would like for example emelyn or
[50:25] Charlie or like uh people here they
[50:28] would hear me say an expression or
[50:31] something that is very Salvadorian and
[50:34] they would go like Sam like
[50:37] whoa so I'm
[50:41] proud amazing yeah it's a uh it's it's
[50:45] so interesting how we have the same
[50:47] language but uh there are so small uh
[50:50] differences even in the small locations
[50:53] in Austra like even Austra is really
[50:55] small it's I mean it's a little bit
[50:57] bigger actually than El Salvador but uh
[51:00] similar size actually than El Salvador
[51:02] but inside of Austria they different
[51:04] dialect so if if people talk like they
[51:07] talk in the dialect and don't talk to
[51:09] the high standard of of German you don't
[51:12] the the the East German the East uh
[51:15] Austrian don't understand the West uh
[51:18] Austrian which is really interesting to
[51:20] see and uh I'm really cool to see that
[51:23] uh that you're doing that and and uh I
[51:26] like to see it um perfect
[51:31] then yeah then uh let's come to the uh
[51:34] end routine of our podcast where we have
[51:37] two questions the first question is for
[51:40] for everyone the same question and then
[51:42] the second question is question that
[51:44] comes from the previous guest and I'm
[51:47] really I'm looking forward to the to the
[51:49] last question because an interesting one
[51:50] could open a new topic uh but first AR
[51:54] one um what can we learn from you
[51:56] besides Bitcoin what can I learn from
[51:59] what besides Bitcoin uh what can we uh
[52:04] me and audience learn from you uh
[52:07] besides Bitcoin and besides uh
[52:12] Spanish okay okay I like that question
[52:16] so I'm gonna take advantage and and and
[52:20] invite uh especially girls to know about
[52:26] to
[52:27] be interested in their Cycles So lately
[52:32] I've been really
[52:35] into
[52:39] feminine
[52:41] wholeness
[52:43] so um yeah I I guess my my answer to
[52:48] this question would be just be curious
[52:51] as a as a man be curious about your
[52:54] girlfriends your moms your sisters
[52:57] the the woman that's beside you about
[52:59] how her body works and only BEC and as a
[53:04] girl be curious about how your body
[53:06] works and only
[53:08] because um all all this time for for I
[53:14] don't know years and years and years and
[53:15] I don't think ever until now we've been
[53:19] cons we uh women we've been considered
[53:24] as the small version of a man right so
[53:27] we're like we're not as a stronger we're
[53:30] not as tall we're not like everything is
[53:32] like the the small vers and this is not
[53:34] a bad connotation or anything it's just
[53:36] the way it has been and uh and now I now
[53:41] I literally went into the rabbit hole of
[53:44] femininity and and and woman's body and
[53:49] I am learning that this is not the case
[53:52] and that we are not a version of a man
[53:55] but we are just our our own version when
[53:57] it comes to literally every system in
[54:01] our body
[54:03] so I don't want to uh take a lot of of
[54:06] the time for this but just very quickly
[54:10] a very easy example to understand this
[54:12] is that you know uh for example our
[54:15] circadian rhythm right like this is
[54:17] something that we all have we all heard
[54:19] about it probably but the difference is
[54:23] that man they their their body their
[54:26] whole system is ruled by their circadian
[54:30] rhythm so their whole energy level sex
[54:34] drive uh hunger everything is related
[54:38] and is ruled by the 24 hours of the
[54:42] light and the night so like when the
[54:45] sun's up you've got your energy you want
[54:47] to do your things you're so productive
[54:49] you're like you you go right as the
[54:52] evening starts you start whining down
[54:54] probably you're socializing you're you
[54:56] have less energy and during the night
[54:59] just go to your man cave watch TV
[55:01] whatever and sleep and that's that's the
[55:04] that's how days are with men and that's
[55:07] how they should be because their their
[55:09] bodies is ruled by their circadian
[55:12] rhythm which lasts 24
[55:14] hours and that's good and we women also
[55:18] have a circadian rhythm we also work
[55:20] with light and with the sun and
[55:22] everything but our bodies are ruled by
[55:28] our infradian Rhythm and this Rhythm
[55:32] lasts 28 in approximate 28 days so this
[55:39] is not a 24hour thing this is a 28 day
[55:44] thing so your energy levels your sex
[55:48] drive your hunger your ability to focus
[55:50] your everything is going to be related
[55:54] on your cycle so so this whole thing is
[55:58] mindblowing for me and and for the girls
[56:02] that I've been talking to about this
[56:04] because um yeah it we we have a Mis a
[56:07] very big misconception about about women
[56:10] and and and in relation to men and why
[56:12] are we not so productive and and and you
[56:15] get or at least I I did like I would get
[56:18] angry with myself because I cannot focus
[56:20] and I just feel like I don't want to do
[56:21] anything but I need to go to the gym and
[56:22] I need to work out and I need to do all
[56:24] these things and if you start learning
[56:26] about how your how your body works you
[56:29] start feeding what your body needs in
[56:32] terms of everything right so this is my
[56:37] my um I don't know how to say like my my
[56:40] sharing just be curious and start Pro if
[56:45] you can and if you want to start
[56:48] investigating about infradian Rhythm and
[56:50] how does it work for girls and circadian
[56:53] rhythm and how does it work for boys
[56:54] because it's very interesting and and I
[56:57] have some books recommendations but you
[56:58] can leave them before or after the the
[57:02] podcast no please uh please what's when
[57:06] we start um because I think this is
[57:08] really interesting I think um a lot of
[57:12] people deny that there are or try to
[57:16] deny that there are differences between
[57:17] male and female and there are a lot of
[57:21] differences uh and and they are natural
[57:23] and they are good and they are it's not
[57:26] the one is better than the other it's
[57:28] they complement each other so uh that's
[57:30] that's the thing that I'm I'm always a
[57:33] little bit uh angry about when people
[57:36] are like
[57:39] no yeah yeah it's like you deserve the
[57:43] same chances everyone deserves the same
[57:45] chances but we're not all the same and
[57:48] that's the big thing always like uh no
[57:50] matter if it's like with age groups or
[57:52] with races or with gender or with
[57:55] whatever it is
[57:57] we're not the same yeah every everyone
[57:59] is unique because everyone comes with a
[58:02] different human capital in the world
[58:04] like we're coming with a different
[58:06] Capital because our parents financially
[58:08] and stuff like that but we come with a
[58:10] different human capital with it and then
[58:12] there are also like and of course there
[58:14] are men that are more closer to being
[58:17] female than some females are there there
[58:21] are exceptions to that but just because
[58:23] there exceptions doesn't mean that there
[58:24] are no differences uh so I think that's
[58:27] extremely important to note um what
[58:31] would you recommend like when you have
[58:33] like one book to start with like in
[58:35] Bitcoin the Bitcoin standard or
[58:37] something like that uh what would you
[58:38] recommend uh people and I have uh a very
[58:43] very large majority of my audience is
[58:46] male so I think the last time I looked
[58:49] it was like
[58:51] 97% or something like that uh of male a
[58:57] uh so not a lot of females in there but
[58:59] I will wait I will I will quickly look
[59:02] uh right now uh let's let's get the last
[59:06] three months in and let's see what the
[59:09] result actually is okay oh it got better
[59:13] 92% a male okay so like it's it's it's 9
[59:20] 92.4% male and
[59:22] 7.5% female and
[59:25] 0.1 % is uh something specific
[59:30] so they put something else than those
[59:33] two just interesting um what what is the
[59:37] one book that you could recommend us all
[59:39] right so to be completely honest I'm
[59:43] sure there's a better recommendation of
[59:47] books especially for men to understand
[59:50] all this I'm sure uh I don't have it I
[59:53] I've I've never really thought about
[59:55] that as like oh if I were a man like why
[59:57] would I read like I honestly I I didn't
[60:00] but I do have the re like books book
[60:03] recommendations for for this topic in
[60:06] general but they're definitely designed
[60:11] more for female readers uh and and yeah
[60:15] that's just that's that but yeah one one
[60:18] of the of the books that I really
[60:20] recommend is the fifth Vital sign
[60:24] by uh uh By Lisa Hendrickson Jack that's
[60:29] her name that's her the author and the
[60:32] other one that I really recommend is
[60:34] woman code by Alisa bitty that's her
[60:39] really cool thank you thank you so
[60:43] yeah amaz the fifth Bible Code it's
[60:47] interesting because Vital sign and then
[60:50] the other one is woman code oh okay okay
[60:53] okay okay perfect then uh we got that uh
[60:56] I will I will search it and and maybe
[60:57] put it in the in the in the show notes
[61:00] uh and then people can directly see it
[61:02] um it's it's so like I have uh 50 more
[61:07] questions just around that topic because
[61:09] really interesting to talk about but I
[61:11] also saw that non-bitcoin related
[61:13] podcasts that I do I mean everything
[61:15] starts with Bitcoin but sometimes I go
[61:18] off in a whole different uh direction
[61:22] for example do you know Lisa
[61:24] Huff uh lisaa and U uh I mispronounced
[61:29] the last name 100% I don't think so and
[61:33] and they're both in Bitcoin they're
[61:34] really both uh not not they're quite
[61:38] known and and and she has her daughter
[61:42] elaha also in Bitcoin and she made an
[61:46] presentation at bit block Boom at a
[61:48] Bitcoin conference about parenting how
[61:50] to raise um a kid to be a critical
[61:53] thinker and actually think for
[61:55] themselves and like just falling in line
[61:58] and this was so an interesting topic
[61:59] that I was like Hey can because she was
[62:02] already on my show but I wanted to have
[62:03] a second time on with that topic
[62:05] specifically before we talked about
[62:07] Bitcoin and energy markets and all that
[62:09] stuff and then I was like hey let's try
[62:11] it out and we did not talk about Bitcoin
[62:15] at all like and maybe a little bit uh
[62:18] but 99% of the podcast was like how to
[62:20] raise kids how was her uh experience
[62:23] with that and how and parenting and
[62:25] stuff like that and that's the only and
[62:28] this is a really interesting point the
[62:30] only podcast format where it's about
[62:35] money where you can talk about parenting
[62:38] is when you talk about Bitcoin yes when
[62:41] when I would have a stock uh investing
[62:45] podcast or real estate podcast no chance
[62:49] that anyone would watch an episode with
[62:52] me about parenting yes the views will be
[62:55] lower that that's for sure but people
[62:57] are in interested in that uh and uh it's
[63:01] it's it's fascinating for me so that's
[63:03] why um we can talk about something else
[63:07] also because Bitcoin touches everything
[63:10] uh and Bitcoin is like it comes in every
[63:14] uh topic a little bit in there and uh we
[63:17] can get really far with with our topics
[63:20] and yeah also thank you for for bringing
[63:22] that up and and and bring that to the
[63:24] table my pleasure my pleasure because
[63:27] this is so um so true uh what you're
[63:30] saying right just now so with the first
[63:33] book that I recommended when I when I
[63:35] was reading that book this was uh I
[63:38] don't know maybe a year ago like it it
[63:40] wasn't that long ago but I was already
[63:42] here I was already full into B Bitcoin I
[63:45] was I was the full thing and I was
[63:48] reading that book and of course Bitcoin
[63:51] like being with you know uh interested
[63:53] and around Bitcoin nurse and Bitcoin uh
[63:57] didn't just give me the financial uh
[64:00] part of Bitcoin it gave me the
[64:02] nutritional and carnivore and and Seed
[64:05] oils and food and everything that comes
[64:08] with the whole pack right so I was
[64:10] already into all that and when I was
[64:12] reading this first
[64:14] book I realized that everything that she
[64:18] was saying uh in in the in the food
[64:22] section let's say in the in the
[64:23] nutritious aspect I was not already
[64:27] doing but I had the idea of do it
[64:31] because of Bitcoin because of the way
[64:34] and the mindset that we have when when
[64:37] we are in this side of of the of the
[64:40] world let's say so uh it was very
[64:43] interesting for me to to realize like
[64:45] wow like if if this knowledge had to
[64:50] come to me one way or the other you know
[64:53] like it's it's insane how how life works
[64:58] for you to like you said like if you
[65:00] really need it it's going to come for
[65:01] you like Bitcoin or whatever it is so
[65:04] with me it was this new information
[65:07] about the feminine body and and and
[65:09] femininity and feminine energy and all
[65:11] these things and um that I kind of
[65:15] already knew but not in that way because
[65:19] of Bitcoin so yeah it was it was really
[65:23] interesting i l that a lot and yeah then
[65:27] now actually come to our end routine of
[65:30] our podcast um where the previous guest
[65:33] is asking a question for the next guest
[65:35] without knowing who the next guest is
[65:36] okay uh it's an amazing thing that I
[65:39] discovered that I copied that from the
[65:41] Bitcoin the uh Diary of a CEO okay with
[65:46] stepen Bartley um and I found it so
[65:49] interesting because Steven Bley diary Z
[65:51] is a non-bitcoin
[65:52] podcast uh but the concept of connecting
[65:56] each guest with the next guest it's like
[65:58] the blockchain pointing to the next
[66:00] block and stuff like that I I I I love
[66:02] it a lot um the question for you from
[66:05] previous guest is do you think Bitcoin
[66:08] brings you closer to
[66:12] God
[66:16] whoa
[66:18] okay yeah I this was also my uh reaction
[66:22] to that uh I mean there is when you make
[66:26] as as I do every day a Bitcoin podcast
[66:28] you hear a lot of stuff with Bitcoin um
[66:32] and I hear it more and more that people
[66:34] are connecting Bitcoin with
[66:38] spirit Spirit let's see if I can
[66:40] pronounce it yeah exactly uh and and and
[66:43] with the Bible and God and and with
[66:46] everything uh I mean there are books
[66:48] about that like Bitcoin and the Bible uh
[66:50] from Pastor coin that there there's
[66:53] actually uh a lot of material on on that
[66:56] topic um but so far Bitcoin did not
[67:00] bring me close to to
[67:02] bitcoin okay but but uh did something
[67:06] like that happen to you or was like did
[67:07] you yeah what do you think about that
[67:10] question okay
[67:12] so a yes or no answer would be no that's
[67:16] my quick easy answer but I am going to
[67:21] say
[67:23] that Bitcoin
[67:26] has brought me closer to my
[67:31] spirituality because I am curious
[67:35] because I want to know more because
[67:37] I'm like like literally this is back to
[67:41] where I was so in my when I when we
[67:44] started the podcast that I was talking
[67:45] about the bubble and how comfortable you
[67:47] are and you don't seek for more and you
[67:49] don't seek for anything else but the
[67:51] things that you know already
[67:53] so doing that and that happening to me
[67:57] with Bitcoin so like realizing there's a
[68:00] whole other thing that I had no idea
[68:02] about and all these things it had made
[68:05] me
[68:06] question basically everything about my
[68:09] life and and myself and and my you know
[68:13] the way I'm living and everything
[68:16] so with in terms of
[68:19] spirituality I said no because
[68:23] I don't see God as the god that's it I
[68:29] so that's why my answer is just no
[68:31] because it hasn't brought me closer
[68:34] to
[68:35] God but um it has
[68:40] definitely helped in opening my mindset
[68:46] into seeking and being curious for more
[68:51] so or for for for anything really so
[68:55] yeah when it comes to spirituality like
[68:57] I I I want to feel more I want to to
[69:02] investigate and to seek and to and to
[69:05] yeah just to to search for for things
[69:08] that before Bitcoin I didn't I was just
[69:11] like no I I'm good like I'm not like I
[69:14] don't I don't practice religion I'm fine
[69:16] I don't care it's good and now like I'm
[69:19] curious I'm just
[69:21] curious It's fascinating for me would
[69:23] you say that Bitcoin made you more open
[69:27] to topics that you would have otherwise
[69:30] dismissed
[69:31] quicker probably I don't have any
[69:34] examples in my like on the top of my
[69:36] head but probably because it's def it's
[69:39] the same thing like before I would be
[69:43] not that I would I would be um
[69:45] close-minded maybe I don't know I don't
[69:47] I don't think so but uh but now because
[69:52] of the fact that I realized this huge
[69:55] thing that I had no idea about is just
[69:58] it just opened the possibilities of well
[70:01] maybe there's a ton of other things that
[70:03] you haven't realized yet right so yeah I
[70:07] would say probably yes it's fascinating
[70:10] it's it's really really really
[70:12] fascinating for me because when you look
[70:16] at for example I when someone brings a
[70:20] topic up uh let's let's make it specific
[70:23] um Ukraine Russia War I have almost no
[70:29] clue about that I have not researched
[70:32] the topic I only heard some things from
[70:35] some people I never researched myself I
[70:38] never even Googled Russia versus Ukraine
[70:41] something like that I never watched a
[70:42] video about it I never heard like really
[70:44] long opinions about that and uh people
[70:48] asked me hey what like how do you think
[70:51] about like people like it's a friendly
[70:53] situation like family situation and they
[70:55] like talking about the Ukraine war and
[70:58] then I just sit there and and say
[70:59] nothing and they're like hey Robin
[71:00] what's what's your take on this uh and
[71:03] uh I usually say one of two things
[71:08] either I try to steer the conversation
[71:10] to bitcoin okay and and H or I say I
[71:14] have no opinion on that yeah and people
[71:17] are crazy when I say that you have to
[71:19] have an opinion on that you have like
[71:22] you you you have to do like and I think
[71:24] it's really bad
[71:25] when we have a society where we pressure
[71:29] people into having a opinion even though
[71:33] maybe they don't want to have an opinion
[71:34] or they did not do the research because
[71:36] I said I don't have an opinion on that I
[71:38] did not do my research on that so I
[71:41] cannot really join the conversation here
[71:43] I can join the conversation about
[71:44] Bitcoin everywhere like Bitcoin is like
[71:46] I have is so so in my mind that I can
[71:49] con can join a conversation almost in
[71:53] every Bitcoin conversation because I
[71:54] talked with so many bitcoiners but with
[71:57] the war like I'm really bad in history I
[72:00] cannot compare it to anything I I'm
[72:02] really bad with politics even though I
[72:04] was in politics before but it's I think
[72:08] we have to get to this point where we
[72:09] just say like it's okay to say I don't
[72:12] have an opinion on that I have to dig
[72:14] deeper I'm curious about it I I am open
[72:17] about it I want to learn more about it
[72:19] but I would not say just because the
[72:21] mainstream says uh that we have to
[72:24] attack the Russian back now I could not
[72:26] say that because I don't know the full
[72:28] picture yeah definitely totally agree I
[72:31] think we as a society and not forget
[72:35] about Society ourselves like each person
[72:39] we have to
[72:42] normalize saying no and saying or like
[72:47] or keeping quiet just if you don't have
[72:50] anything to say it's okay not to say
[72:53] anything like we are
[72:56] so used to just talking and just saying
[73:00] [ __ ] all the time because like you said
[73:03] like probably anybody else but you would
[73:06] have said oh yeah you know I think about
[73:08] BL and they just spayed out something
[73:11] that they don't even understand what
[73:12] they're saying and they and everybody's
[73:13] going to be like nodding because because
[73:15] you have to nod right like and and it's
[73:19] like that is that is something that I've
[73:22] I've trying I I've been trying to uh
[73:25] Implement more in my life like if I
[73:26] don't have anything to say I can keep
[73:28] quiet and it's okay it it's not going to
[73:31] hurt me to keep quiet you know and if I
[73:34] don't have an opinion I can say I don't
[73:35] have an opinion if I don't want to do
[73:37] something I can say I don't want to do
[73:39] something we're just sewing to
[73:41] everything being yes and everything
[73:43] being let's go and and do right like
[73:46] like the the masculine
[73:51] energy but yeah it's
[73:53] true and and Dad is also uh wait I with
[73:58] the masculine energy now I forgot what
[74:00] the wanted to say the what uh I I forgot
[74:04] what I want to say wait

[75:04] the first um it's my first podcast
[75:08] really well no um I did I think my first
[75:11] was with Mike uh Peterson with Bitcoin
[75:16] Beach that's but this is my first
[75:19] podcast alone that's that's the thing
[75:22] I've always been with Quenton or with
[75:25] someone else in Bitcoin Berlin like in
[75:27] the podcast Studio there there but yeah
[75:30] this is my first podcast alone that's
[75:32] why it's
[75:34] it's I do only to get a podcast if uh
[75:38] the guests want it uh because I feel
[75:41] like oneon-one on podcast is is so
[75:46] nice um other than it's a debate if you
[75:50] have a debate then it should be a
[75:51] moderator and the two sides other than
[75:54] that I really prefer the one in ones
[75:57] because uh there are clear roles there
[76:00] are clear because then you have to like
[76:02] ask them and then and then it's it's I
[76:05] feel like it's it's a better experience
[76:08] for everyone involved if it's one-on-one
