[00:00] how if we are looking to ensure the
[00:02] Bitcoin how can we make it more robust
[00:05] to loss damages theft any other asset
[00:09] you know Fine Art gold Collectibles
[00:11] anything else would have an insurance
[00:12] market and the idea ultimately with
[00:14] insurance is that you come to an
[00:15] agreement with someone and that in the
[00:17] event something goes wrong they'll be
[00:18] able to step in and adify you this was
[00:21] much more directly akin to a bar of gold
[00:23] I have a coin it has information on it
[00:25] it needs to be safe and not kept not
[00:27] destroyed so you're kind of like locking
[00:29] it away in a traditional of all right
[00:30] cuz you're still dealing with like a
[00:31] physical token we leverage um multi sigs
[00:34] of multi sigs so actually for the length
[00:36] of your insurance contract anchor watch
[00:38] is a required co-signer it's an
[00:40] interesting concept too cuz at no point
[00:42] ever can the money be moved by anchor
[00:44] watch by ourselves basically any
[00:47] individual who self- custody what
[00:49] they're doing is called self-insuring
[00:51] and all that means is that you bear all
[00:54] the
[00:54] [Music]
[00:58] risk we can the start into with with
[01:01] Bitcoin insurances a little bit because
[01:03] that I think that's a topic that is
[01:04] rarely discussed on any top on any
[01:07] podcast it's also something that's
[01:08] that's pretty new uh so that's what
[01:11] you're currently focused on with with
[01:13] anchor watch and and yourself as I
[01:15] understood it yeah absolutely yeah so uh
[01:19] the base premise I me anchor watch is
[01:20] coming up on three years old the initial
[01:22] premise was ultimately the way Bitcoin
[01:25] is kind of managed today um you think
[01:28] about it in the sense of risk man
[01:29] management you have uh and that it
[01:33] relates with insurance the way Bitcoin
[01:35] really works today is if you're an
[01:37] individual basically any individual who
[01:41] self- custody what they're doing is
[01:42] called self-insuring and all that means
[01:44] is that you bear all the risk if
[01:47] something goes wrong there's no refunds
[01:48] in Bitcoin if something gets mismanaged
[01:50] you lose your Bitcoin right and
[01:53] bitcoin's had a long history of this
[01:57] practice and it takes in different forms
[01:58] right because at first maybe it was uh
[02:02] use a a computer that's offline or save
[02:04] multiple backups right just have
[02:06] multiple backups of your keys in case
[02:07] something goes wrong you don't want a
[02:08] single point of failure uh the next
[02:10] probably like step would be um having
[02:13] all of your keys never touching the
[02:15] internet however you execute that
[02:17] whether it's a computer that's offline
[02:18] or a hardware wallet right thinking
[02:20] about it that way and then you start
[02:21] thinking about ways of Distributing risk
[02:24] of uh a multi- signature right you have
[02:26] a single signature you go to a multi
[02:28] signature your further kind of
[02:31] unbundling single points of failure and
[02:34] maybe you use different Hardware wallets
[02:36] for each key right so now you're kind of
[02:38] Distributing risk across all of these
[02:39] different um technical Stacks that kind
[02:41] of do the handling of transaction data
[02:43] the keys and the you know the signing of
[02:46] transactions all of this is in the
[02:47] bucket of risk mitigation and risk
[02:50] distribution uh the one in the umbrella
[02:53] of risk management the one thing that's
[02:54] been really missing up to this point is
[02:55] risk transference which is insurance and
[02:58] with that looking at the larger
[03:00] ecosystem if you look at the larger
[03:02] custodians and exchanges the ETFs and
[03:04] everything there is a massively
[03:07] underserved Market where coinbase has
[03:09] hundreds of billions of dollars of
[03:10] assets under management and they maybe
[03:12] have a $300 million insurance policy
[03:15] right so thinking about it from a market
[03:16] opportunity standpoint it's something
[03:18] that has not really been uh fleshed out
[03:21] yet in the maturation of Bitcoin as a
[03:23] financial asset I think as Bitcoin
[03:25] continues to grow our thesis and I think
[03:28] this is just manifestly going to be true
[03:30] is that there's going to be a more
[03:31] robust Insurance Market that begins to
[03:32] develop around it right um any other
[03:35] asset you know Fine Art gold
[03:37] Collectibles anything else would have an
[03:38] insurance market and the idea ultimately
[03:40] with insurance is that you come to an
[03:43] agreement with someone and that in the
[03:44] event something goes wrong uh they'll be
[03:47] able to step in and indemnify you right
[03:49] um repair you for the damages right uh
[03:51] today our policy is settled in US
[03:53] Dollars we can get into a long
[03:54] conversation about that but the this
[03:57] presented a unique opportunity for us
[03:58] thinking about
[04:00] how if we are looking to ensure the
[04:02] Bitcoin how can we make it more robust
[04:05] to loss damages theft right ways that
[04:09] you could possibly lose the Bitcoin
[04:11] because you have an arrangement with an
[04:13] insurer where you're all risk aligned
[04:16] every no one's looking for a loss right
[04:18] if everyone's an honest actor everyone
[04:19] wants everyone to be happy and the coins
[04:21] to be kept safe and secure so this is
[04:23] where we went to the other side of
[04:26] attacking the problem not just from a
[04:27] financial contract of insurance but
[04:29] thinking about technically how can we
[04:31] improve how Bitcoin is custodi on layer
[04:33] one today to be able to offer that risk
[04:35] distribution and kind of like fail safes
[04:36] and guarantees uh as much as the tech
[04:39] can enable right uh of how to actually
[04:42] execute this and that kind of goes into
[04:43] what we've built with the Trident Vault
[04:45] and leveraging miniscript and doing more
[04:47] advanced Bitcoin native smart contracts
[04:49] uh which pair nicely with insurance and
[04:51] I I'll leave it there because I think
[04:52] there's a lot of places we can take the
[04:54] conversation whether it's on the
[04:55] insurance side or on the tech side yeah
[04:57] there's a lot I mean uh
[05:00] you have been long in Bitcoin As I
[05:01] understood it from from previous podcast
[05:04] uh so you have probably lived through a
[05:05] lot of Innovations and cycles of like
[05:07] how to cust the Bitcoin and and the mxes
[05:10] the exchanges the the things that go
[05:12] bust uh even in the last uh like four
[05:15] and a half five years where I was in the
[05:17] space A lot has happened um and it's so
[05:20] so interesting that the insurance is not
[05:23] as I understood it this is something
[05:25] completely new like insurance is
[05:27] basically like this last year developing
[05:30] what I heard from from Chris like that
[05:32] that's something that that is just now
[05:34] developing right yeah absolutely so
[05:36] insurance has existed for some time um
[05:39] actually someone recently linked me when
[05:42] Andreas Antonopoulos went on Joe Rogan
[05:44] in
[05:45] 2014 um I forget the Red Band the guy
[05:49] who uh was on with uh Joe that was
[05:51] interviewing Andreas and they're talk
[05:54] and the guy ask like hey can you like
[05:56] Ure Bitcoin and sure enough um if you
[06:00] remember so I got into Bitcoin in 2013
[06:02] and end of 2013 if you know like the
[06:03] cash Asis coins in 2014 Lloyds of London
[06:07] was offering Insurance on those cash
[06:08] ases coins and Andreas talks about it in
[06:11] that podcast but right think about this
[06:13] mentally though this was much more
[06:15] directly akin to a bar of gold I have a
[06:17] coin it has information on it it needs
[06:19] to be safe and not kept not destroyed so
[06:22] you're kind of like locking it away in a
[06:23] traditional Vault right because you're
[06:24] still dealing with like a physical token
[06:26] um when you're thinking about larger
[06:28] like insurance over the years what you
[06:30] would typically get is at custodians you
[06:32] would get uh an insurance policy which
[06:35] would be uh crime the bucket of crime
[06:38] right so when you think about insurance
[06:40] there's many different kinds of
[06:41] insurance there's homeowners insurance
[06:42] there's car insurance there's life
[06:44] insurance there's health insurance right
[06:46] there's many different buckets of things
[06:48] um most of the insurance coverage that's
[06:51] existed up to this point um when it
[06:53] involves Bitcoin is crime insurance and
[06:55] what that means is that okay I leave my
[06:57] money at an exchange in the event they
[07:00] do some sort of internal theft and crime
[07:02] I want to make sure that I can pay on my
[07:03] customers typically how this is works is
[07:06] It's usually the hot wallets that get
[07:07] insured because that's those are the
[07:08] ones that are most actively touched and
[07:10] managed um but when you even those that
[07:14] extend into the cold wallets um they're
[07:16] narrowly covering a specific thing maybe
[07:18] it's like the destruction of the keys
[07:19] being held by the custodian or crime
[07:21] right um this idea of what we brought to
[07:25] Market I would say is new and novel in
[07:28] that one we are are what's called a
[07:30] Lloyds of London cover holder meaning we
[07:32] are direct agents of Lloyds of London
[07:33] and that when we sell you an anchor
[07:35] watch insurance policy uh it is a Lloyds
[07:38] of London contract right so today we're
[07:41] available in the United States only
[07:43] working on larger Ambitions and
[07:45] expanding globally but for today we're
[07:47] live in the United States um if you were
[07:49] to be insured by us it's a Lloyds of
[07:51] London policy up to this point this was
[07:53] not readily accessible to the random
[07:55] person walking off the street we're the
[07:57] first um able to offer this to retail
[08:00] non-commercial entities we also can use
[08:02] commercial entities our policies
[08:04] minimums start at
[08:05] $250,000 and we can actually write up to
[08:07] $100 million of coverage uh per customer
[08:12] and this is from an accessibility
[08:15] standpoint way more straightforward
[08:17] where you talk to us and we can curate
[08:18] and like build you out um your fault and
[08:20] your policy and get that on the road
[08:22] whereas before you had to go through
[08:23] many intermediaries and trying to like
[08:25] broker one-off deals so that's kind of a
[08:27] new Innovative thing and what we're kind
[08:29] offering uh to that uh it really has
[08:33] developed in the past year I know Chris
[08:35] is working on some stuff as well at bit
[08:36] Insurance like this is something that in
[08:38] the past year being able to kind of
[08:40] provide this rapper more directly has
[08:41] been out there there have been some
[08:44] predecessors um I know there's a company
[08:47] called coin cover uh that had wallet
[08:50] Insurance um I think they discontinued
[08:53] that product because they were also
[08:54] offering Insurance on coins held at
[08:57] Celsius and FTX which which as you can
[08:59] imagine not not not not something from a
[09:02] risk appetite standpoint uh you want to
[09:04] be underwriting risk for uh so when you
[09:06] think about it there's been versions and
[09:09] forms of this there's like crypto defi
[09:11] versions of like you lock up tokens and
[09:14] then the token if the loss happens right
[09:16] um but really it's something that I
[09:18] think the whole ecosystem has started
[09:20] paying attention to over the past one to
[09:22] two years uh we were kind of a little
[09:24] bit skating to where the puck was going
[09:25] when we started three years ago uh and
[09:28] ultimately I just this Bitcoin maturing
[09:30] as a financial asset ultimately I view
[09:32] like the biggest risk of the ETFs or
[09:35] even micro strategy or any of these
[09:36] large like Bitcoin companies that like
[09:38] companies that have a lot of Bitcoin on
[09:39] their balance sheet is not like oh the
[09:41] Bitcoin price is going to zero right
[09:42] because that's usually how it's framed
[09:43] it's like well Bitcoin over time we're
[09:45] all directionally long Bitcoin we think
[09:47] it's going to go up so like there's no
[09:49] like like that's not a problem here the
[09:51] biggest risk is that the coins go
[09:52] missing right they get lost they get
[09:54] stolen whatever have you and if you look
[09:57] at the ecosystem today all of the ETF f
[09:59] s primarily are using coinbase I believe
[10:03] well so one Fidelity the ETF at Fidelity
[10:06] is managed by their own team right so
[10:07] anyone who's getting ETF exposure I
[10:09] recommend at least throwing some in
[10:10] Fidelity because it's at least an
[10:12] uncorrelated risk to uh it being held at
[10:15] coinbase it's a different team I think
[10:17] bito has one of them uh there's a couple
[10:19] like like a small longtail but most of
[10:21] the aggregation risk for all of these
[10:23] Financial products are sitting at
[10:24] coinbase whether those are the retail
[10:25] wallets coinbase institutional the ETFs
[10:28] and there isn't incremental insurance
[10:31] coverage to my knowledge on top of any
[10:32] of those right um and so as if you're
[10:36] paying management fees you're paying
[10:38] like you're paying fees to be able to
[10:39] secure Bitcoin when you're using these
[10:40] institutions to us at anchor watch it
[10:43] just makes sense to have a risk aligned
[10:45] relationship where you're paying for
[10:47] something that if something were to go
[10:49] wrong you still have your exposure like
[10:51] you still have your wealth at the end of
[10:52] the day as opposed to maybe becoming an
[10:54] unsecured creditor or having uncertainty
[10:56] in how um incidents would get Unwound
[10:58] and what percent you would get back like
[11:00] you want to avoid those incidents like
[11:02] FTX where they made 100% back but it was
[11:06] denominated in dollars at like the cycle
[11:08] low of $16,000 Bitcoin so they ended up
[11:10] like marking it it was like you know a
[11:11] 20% something recovery for the actual
[11:14] value at the time the loss happened um I
[11:17] just think insurance is just a very
[11:18] natural market fit for working with
[11:20] inter intermediaries and also just like
[11:23] long-term asset wealth and management
[11:25] right Insurance typically is something
[11:26] that uh people who have wealth
[11:30] get because they're trying to protect
[11:32] their wealth right they're trying to
[11:33] make sure that if something were to go
[11:34] wrong I want to make sure that I have a
[11:36] certain amount of wealth the end of the
[11:37] day and just honestly goes to kind of
[11:39] like the maturation of the ecosystem
[11:41] that we're just getting to a point now
[11:42] where uh people are starting to consider
[11:44] that longer time Horizon of uh making
[11:47] sure that they can keep that Bitcoin
[11:48] safe and be uh protected against many
[11:50] risks super interesting and and if you
[11:53] ensure something you probably also have
[11:56] like okay this is how the custody set
[11:59] set up should look like like you you you
[12:01] probably have like a checklist where
[12:03] it's interesting you also train kind of
[12:05] the the client of like uh this is the
[12:09] security standard or this is where we we
[12:11] want to do do you have like a a
[12:13] checklist and like okay you have take
[12:15] those boxes yeah so there's specific
[12:18] they're called insured like duties like
[12:19] your responsibilities in entering the
[12:21] contract the first thing is if today our
[12:24] our Flagship product as we call it uh
[12:26] you're using trid inv vaol which is our
[12:28] kind of uh custody technology stack that
[12:31] we built out which is leveraging these
[12:33] more advanced Bitcoin native smart
[12:35] contracts um just at a very high level
[12:37] what that means uh is that we're using
[12:40] Bitcoin as programmable money and we're
[12:41] able to do things that other providers
[12:44] in the market have not done yet um these
[12:46] are operations that don't require
[12:48] softwork or any changes today uh and
[12:51] there's a couple key premises here one
[12:53] we leverage um multi sigs of multi sigs
[12:57] so actually for the length of your
[12:58] insurance contract um anchor watch is a
[13:01] required co-signer it's an interesting
[13:03] concept too because at no point ever can
[13:06] the money be moved by anchor watch by
[13:09] ourselves right and so that's an
[13:11] interesting concept of what we like to
[13:13] call negative control so um at a very
[13:16] high level just to walk and then the
[13:17] second thing we use is time locks and
[13:18] I'll get into that now so at the start
[13:20] of your policy uh you have a vault which
[13:24] is a two of three multisig and a two of
[13:27] three multisig the first two of three is
[13:29] managed by anchor watch the second two
[13:30] of three is managed by you the customer
[13:32] that means that both of us have to sign
[13:35] on the transaction and you can think
[13:37] immediately this does a lot of
[13:38] interesting mitigations of risk right if
[13:40] someone uh broke into your house like
[13:43] like got into um your keys have to be
[13:45] stored in safety deposit boxes or actual
[13:48] vaults right like um like safes um
[13:51] physical ones and because of that you're
[13:53] in a dynamic where uh if you if you were
[13:57] just doing a two3 multi if the attackers
[14:00] get the keys your keys then that means
[14:01] the bitcoin's moving with us uh we have
[14:05] to also coign the transaction before
[14:06] money can move which allows us to be
[14:08] able to kind of slow things down in the
[14:10] protection of your interest to making
[14:11] sure is this an agreed upon withdrawal
[14:13] right um we're able to Institute two
[14:16] different kind of concepts of one
[14:17] enforcing a white list right making sure
[14:19] that it's a pre-approved address that
[14:21] you already like authorize and sign off
[14:23] I want to send Bitcoin to this address
[14:25] and then additionally we're also able to
[14:26] have things like velocity controls so
[14:28] hypothe Al um this this is actually an
[14:31] interesting point too as it interrelates
[14:33] with the risk of the policy is that um
[14:37] many of our customers are opting into
[14:39] What's called the Huddle discount
[14:40] meaning hey this is my deep Cold Storage
[14:42] I'm not going to touch it all year I
[14:44] don't want to spend it at all and
[14:46] because of that we're able to evaluate
[14:48] and say hey the risk is materially
[14:50] lowered if they're not regularly
[14:51] transacting with the Vault and we're
[14:53] able to offer better pricing because of
[14:55] that right because there's lower risk
[14:56] right so you can start seeing how us in
[14:59] the insurance role are able to actually
[15:01] incentify behaviors that are risk
[15:03] aligned saying if that you are going to
[15:05] engage in lower risk activities we can
[15:07] offer you cheaper coverage because of
[15:09] this like now like that's that first
[15:11] layer right the 203 from the customer
[15:12] and the two3 from anchor watch six
[15:14] months into the
[15:15] policy um you're actually in a position
[15:18] where we leverage time locks to say you
[15:20] know what maybe if you've lost two of
[15:21] your keys for whatever reason it's only
[15:22] one of your keys as the customer as well
[15:24] as a two of three from us at anchor
[15:26] watch now this provides you some more
[15:28] flexibility and just being able to know
[15:29] that hey if I have one of my keys
[15:31] accessible I can still move funds six
[15:33] months in now the next step is at month
[15:36] 11 roughly basically when you're getting
[15:39] to towards the end of the policy there
[15:41] is a window where you're still insured
[15:43] where it actually goes to in the event
[15:45] you lost all of your keys right um Home
[15:47] Fires disasters thefts robberies what
[15:50] have you it goes to an anchor watch two
[15:52] of three as well as we use our recovery
[15:55] partner uh coin Corner based out of the
[15:58] is ofand been in business for 10 years
[15:59] as a Bitcoin exchange I'm sure many of
[16:01] your audience knows them uh they can
[16:03] also have a key to be able to move the
[16:05] funds and this allows us to again anchor
[16:08] watch can't unilaterally spend the funds
[16:11] and additionally uh multi- like
[16:13] multi-jurisdictional right they're based
[16:14] over in the ISA man and we're able to
[16:17] act in the event that something were to
[16:19] go wrong we can still help you recover
[16:20] your funds which is kind of
[16:21] fundamentally different than how other
[16:24] arrangements work today where maybe uh a
[16:26] partner has a minority of keys and you
[16:28] still still need to have some key
[16:29] material this additionally is really
[16:31] interesting because we've gotten a lot
[16:33] of initial feedback on this is a really
[16:34] handy inheritance protocol where if your
[16:37] heirs your beneficiaries um don't have
[16:39] to have Bitcoin knowledge and they don't
[16:41] have to manage key material to be able
[16:43] to return funds to you right so this is
[16:45] like a fundamental like difference in
[16:47] how other recovery systems work today
[16:49] final step though is that after the
[16:51] insurance policy expires we don't have a
[16:53] contractual relationship with you
[16:54] anymore it goes to your sole two of
[16:56] three custody right which is a different
[16:58] Dynamic than working with a custodian
[17:00] where um maybe you have a one-year
[17:02] contract the contract ends and you're
[17:03] like hey can I please get my Bitcoin
[17:05] back you have to ask them to get it back
[17:07] whereas in this the default state it
[17:08] goes back to your sole unilateral
[17:10] control um and this is all done on chain
[17:14] um leveraging as I mentioned earlier
[17:16] before miniscript which came out of
[17:17] block stream in 2019 from uh Peter will
[17:20] um Andrew polston sanet gandar like that
[17:23] team put this together and it U we don't
[17:26] have to go into the technical details
[17:27] unless you wish um it's a very um Clean
[17:31] safe way to be able to do these more um
[17:33] arbitrary ways of securing your Bitcoin
[17:36] in a safe
[17:37] manner yeah I think the minus scripts
[17:39] are something that uh not too many are
[17:43] actually aware of that I mean it's it's
[17:45] it's uh it's getting it's I see it more
[17:48] and more developed and I see it more and
[17:50] more discussed about uh but it's
[17:52] actually is something that I also just
[17:54] got aware of like I think six months ago
[17:57] or something like that where first at my
[17:59] touch point with manuscripts uh so it is
[18:03] definitely something that that uh we we
[18:05] should talk a little bit about sure um
[18:08] maybe not to too deep in in technical
[18:10] details but like uh give us some give us
[18:13] some overview of like what minis scripts
[18:15] are and and how they can be leveraged
[18:17] yeah absolutely so I would even just
[18:19] take a super step back right because we
[18:21] are using miniscript for our use case
[18:24] and application but let's just super
[18:26] zoom out to the general audience here
[18:29] Bitcoin uh and one of the strengths that
[18:31] many of the proponents of Bitcoin
[18:33] believe is that it's very um narrow in
[18:36] what it can do right it doesn't do
[18:38] arbitrary smart contracts that are
[18:40] turning
[18:41] Complete because of this um there is um
[18:45] a very set few things that can be done
[18:47] in Bitcoin now typically up to this
[18:50] point we have gravitated as an industry
[18:53] towards either single signature or
[18:55] multi- signature another example of
[18:57] something that's different would be like
[18:59] a lightning Channel like a bolt 3 um
[19:01] like like the actual way that the smart
[19:04] contract on chain is a two of two that
[19:06] falls back and then you can do ad
[19:07] Justice transaction all of that uh
[19:10] there's a lot of technical overhead when
[19:12] it comes to this right you have to think
[19:14] about okay I need to be able to know
[19:17] what the format is I need to have it be
[19:18] reliable I want to make sure the only
[19:20] way I can spend it is the way I'm
[19:22] intending it can be spent right if you
[19:24] if you yourself like Bitcoin script is a
[19:26] full programming language of itself it
[19:28] may be not turning complete but you can
[19:30] do many things in there right I think
[19:32] there's like 150 or so op codes um that
[19:35] can do different things and you could
[19:37] just write a program yourself I want to
[19:39] do op if if this else that right and
[19:42] then but one of the immediate problems
[19:43] is is are you sure the way that you
[19:45] coded that is the only way you can spend
[19:47] it right if you're just like casually a
[19:49] computer like like you you you set up an
[19:51] address and you like uh set up your
[19:54] contract there's no refunds so if you
[19:56] deposit money maybe the first problem is
[19:58] oh no did I set this up in a way that it
[20:00] actually can't be spent and I just sent
[20:01] Bitcoin in there it's locked forever
[20:03] that's totally a possibility right um
[20:06] other ones are being hey I C it up this
[20:08] way but uh a minor can actually
[20:11] rearrange how I'm broadcasting the
[20:12] transaction and steal the money from me
[20:14] right there's all of these like
[20:15] contingencies and Corner cases that get
[20:18] really prickly and thorny and when
[20:20] you're trying to actually do it uh
[20:21] additionally when it's time to broadcast
[20:23] the transaction you have to actually
[20:25] arrange the script in such a way where
[20:27] you're providing the signatures in the
[20:28] right order and stuff and that gets a
[20:29] little complicated uh what miniscript
[20:32] does it allows it remove I call it
[20:34] bowling with bumpers where you can't
[20:35] throw a gutter ball like if you program
[20:37] it as long as you have the key material
[20:39] that you're supposed to have you're able
[20:40] to kind of execute and spend the money
[20:42] uh and this is a really helpful way for
[20:46] also Hardware wallets to be able to
[20:47] arbitrarily interface with these more um
[20:50] Advanced spending policies to be able to
[20:51] provide signatures and verify yes I'm
[20:53] sending the funds in the way I intend
[20:55] them to um it's in that sense I would
[21:00] say a really broad canvas for people to
[21:03] start thinking about how you can use
[21:04] this here's a really simple example on
[21:07] how you could leverage Min script uh you
[21:09] as an individual let's say you have a
[21:10] two of three multisig um you may want to
[21:13] have and say if the money has not moved
[21:15] in a year maybe make it a one of three
[21:18] multisig or maybe make it a two of four
[21:20] you could have a buddy who on the normal
[21:22] day-to-day operations of the Vault can't
[21:24] do anything with the Bitcoin but they
[21:27] can come step in and co-sign with you as
[21:29] a fallback contingency uh really great
[21:32] project that's kind of like fleshed this
[21:33] out is lyanna wallet over at wizard
[21:35] sardine those guys um it's a really
[21:38] handy way of starting to think about
[21:40] using uh these tools in a self-
[21:42] sovereign way you can run the software
[21:43] it's free open source on your own node
[21:45] um and it provides a lot of flexibility
[21:47] in many different ways you can spend the
[21:49] Bitcoin um other ones that like I the
[21:52] this goes into a conversation too about
[21:54] time locks I think the idea of adding
[21:55] time locks to your Bitcoin security is a
[21:57] massive Improvement to what we have
[21:59] today because with time locks you can
[22:01] actually have contingencies baked into
[22:03] how the money can be spent and that
[22:05] gives you more flexibility and more
[22:07] Disaster Recovery right because the way
[22:08] Bitcoin works is you kind of set up your
[22:10] rules you deposit the money and then it
[22:12] sits there um you can have many
[22:14] different ways you can spend that
[22:16] Bitcoin over the course of time which
[22:18] gives you risk mitigation risk
[22:20] distribution contingencies right you
[22:22] don't have all of your eggs in your two
[22:24] of three basket um and these are just
[22:26] really just powerful Concepts when
[22:27] you're thinking about how you want to be
[22:29] able to spend your money across time
[22:31] that give you even on today for like a
[22:33] self- sovereign user a lot more
[22:35] governance like control and confidence
[22:37] and understanding that they have many
[22:39] different ways that they can make sure
[22:40] their Bitcoin is safe at the end of the
[22:42] day I think it's an amazing thing of
[22:45] like hey like if if I didn't move my
[22:47] Bitcoin for a certain period of time
[22:49] there's a key unlocked and I I can still
[22:51] do it in case I I lose some some of some
[22:54] of my keys uh and hopefully with that
[22:57] also the stories of like oh lost my keys
[22:59] and now I don't have access to my
[23:00] Bitcoin get less and less over time
[23:02] because there were a lot of stories like
[23:03] a few years ago and I hope in a few
[23:05] years we have less and less of those
[23:07] stories exactly right uh and that's you
[23:10] know that's why we attack it like the
[23:11] way we're using it um for this risk
[23:13] distribution right reducing the ways
[23:14] that you could possibly lose the coins
[23:17] um even having contingencies of in the
[23:19] event everything is lost uh for you as
[23:22] the customer that you're were still able
[23:24] to recover I think this is just a really
[23:26] robust design space of being able to
[23:28] offer support right and over the past
[23:30] two years we've had many of the hardware
[23:32] wallets um you have The Ledger you have
[23:34] the cold card the bitbox O2 the Spectre
[23:37] DIY the blockstream Jade they're all
[23:40] kind of coming to step in and like be
[23:41] able to provide that infrastructure
[23:42] because that was kind of part of The
[23:43] Last Mile friction in understanding okay
[23:46] technically I can run this on my command
[23:48] line and I can do a couple things but
[23:49] like how can I actually have my
[23:52] traditional signing experience that I'm
[23:53] used to and comfortable with to be able
[23:55] to run with this so I think it's a
[23:58] really great Improvement and it's really
[24:00] interesting in that it doesn't require a
[24:01] fork at all right this is just using
[24:03] Bitcoin as it exists today um that's
[24:06] kind of the Hat I wear as an
[24:07] entrepreneur of there may be things I
[24:09] want to change Bitcoin in the future
[24:11] like there are features like like
[24:12] vaulting um you know being able to
[24:14] restrict outputs so that I can kind of
[24:16] do my own native velocity controls and
[24:18] all that stuff but I'm building a
[24:20] company today and I'm not going to build
[24:21] my company on the assumption that I'm
[24:23] going to get something in the future so
[24:25] uh I think this is just a really ripe
[24:27] design space for uh not just myself but
[24:29] anyone who's thinking about building
[24:31] applications in Bitcoin I think there is
[24:33] a massive amount of opportunity for
[24:35] being able to build in this and the way
[24:37] I view this too is that Bitcoin as
[24:39] programmable money the more that we
[24:41] leverage those native programmable
[24:42] functions we're going to be able to
[24:44] build better Financial applications
[24:46] across the board um and it's a really
[24:49] interesting way of being able to think
[24:51] about how you can provide values to
[24:52] customers uh by kind of having ways that
[24:55] maybe they can still be self- Sovereign
[24:57] you're not dealing with AUST zodan and
[24:59] you're able to kind of improve that uh
[25:01] you know just ultimate like that store
[25:03] value use case because this is a layer
[25:04] one solution it doesn't unlock
[25:06] inherently new layer 2 scaling
[25:07] Technologies on its own uh but for me
[25:11] and kind of what I chose to tackle with
[25:12] in starting this company was that store
[25:14] value long-term holding use case and
[25:17] this just seems to be U it's very
[25:19] apparent to me uh a very great way of
[25:21] being able to offer more to kind of
[25:23] service that use case today that really
[25:25] has not been explored up to this point
[25:27] in the larger industry
[25:28] it's an interesting point that you
[25:30] brought up a minute ago uh with like
[25:32] changes to the Bitcoin uh protocol what
[25:36] are because you have have seen already
[25:38] so so lot so much in the in the past
[25:41] couple of years what do you think are
[25:42] the changes that we have to do or should
[25:45] come to the Bitcoin protocol in in the
[25:47] coming years yeah so um the lens I view
[25:51] this through is I mean and there's many
[25:53] different cohorts in Bitcoin that have
[25:56] all different things they want to work
[25:57] on right my my main you like focus is
[26:01] layer One Security right and there's
[26:04] kind of a spectrum of like small baby
[26:05] steps and kind of like a grander vision
[26:07] to start I think looking at something
[26:10] like uh CTV being able to restrict
[26:12] outputs and being able to do kind of
[26:13] Vault schemes with that is a great way
[26:16] to start uh and being able to say hey
[26:18] once it's in this Vault I only can send
[26:20] it to this address maybe have a time
[26:21] lock against it and it kind of gives you
[26:22] like an intermediary staging area before
[26:24] funds can go out to like the larger
[26:27] ecosystem
[26:28] uh with this too I think there's been
[26:30] some conversation recently around CTV
[26:32] and cig from stack um cig from stack
[26:35] allows you to do kinds of like key
[26:37] delegation um I was watching some posts
[26:40] yesterday with cig from stack Jeremy
[26:42] Ruben was talking about how you could
[26:43] actually prove that a key only signs
[26:45] once and it won't sign again uh like
[26:47] like you can do interesting security
[26:49] models and trade-offs as it relates to
[26:51] that uh I think that's like a small step
[26:53] in the sense that the code has been
[26:55] around for five years there hasn't
[26:57] really been a bug or an issue found yet
[26:59] I think there's a large like five coin
[27:00] Bitcoin Bounty for anyone to find a bug
[27:02] in it it's been sitting there um I think
[27:04] that's a good like initial step if we're
[27:06] talking like the grander vision of what
[27:08] I would love to see um I'd love to be
[27:11] able to do 64bit math and the reason why
[27:14] is that uh you actually could start
[27:16] doing core velocity controls of how much
[27:18] and with with transaction introspection
[27:20] like looking at the details of what
[27:21] you're sending I could say like hey if
[27:23] I'm sending over a Bitcoin you have this
[27:26] security Arrangement if I'm sending less
[27:27] than a Bitcoin it's this like lower
[27:28] security threshold and start thinking
[27:30] about all of these products and services
[27:33] that companies offer today for like
[27:35] helping secure your coins with wh list
[27:37] and velocity controls and how much you
[27:38] can spend you could in theory bring that
[27:42] to a state where it exists on chain
[27:44] right I'm talking to uh like uh nvk from
[27:47] coin kind he's like I just want to get
[27:49] to a point where you don't even need the
[27:50] cold card anymore right I want to
[27:51] obsolete myself out of business I want
[27:52] all of the security and all of the like
[27:54] the ways that you can kind of control
[27:55] and manage your funds with an HSM I just
[27:57] want to have that on chain um those
[27:59] transactions would be larger um that's
[28:01] kind of a a much more further out like
[28:04] ambiguous like larger goal but I think
[28:06] there's small incremental steps that we
[28:08] can take between now and then uh to be
[28:11] able to kind of marginal like
[28:13] incrementally improve that security like
[28:14] an OP Vault construction where I was
[28:17] just having a conversation this morning
[28:18] with uh Matt Caro and a couple and James
[28:20] o bur on Twitter um the way Bitcoin
[28:23] works today it's it's entirely proactive
[28:26] security right you set up the way on how
[28:27] the money can be spent and then you kind
[28:29] of like you have your your drawbridge
[28:31] and your moat and you have like your
[28:34] like all of your defenses but if someone
[28:36] gets through that and they send the
[28:37] Bitcoin out you have one block to be
[28:40] able to try and send it somewhere else
[28:42] and then and then otherwise you're just
[28:44] done uh that's worked really well up to
[28:48] this point I would love to have reactive
[28:50] security where uh after a fund like
[28:53] funds get broadcasted you have a window
[28:55] and opportunity to be able to pull those
[28:56] funds back so you go from
[28:58] I have less than a block to try and fix
[29:01] this issue to maybe I have hundreds or
[29:03] thousands of blocks on the orders of
[29:04] days or weeks where I can have deep cold
[29:07] storage and say okay I'm going to do a
[29:10] withdrawal but it's not going to be able
[29:11] to go out of the Vault entirely until
[29:16] you know two weeks have gone by and that
[29:18] allows an opportunity for me to realize
[29:20] oh no something has happened and they
[29:22] try and pull those funds back you have
[29:23] to manage a different set of keys to be
[29:25] able to do that to be clear all layer
[29:27] one Bitcoin security is assumptions
[29:28] though or that your private keys are
[29:29] kept private um I would love though to
[29:32] be able to take that window of you have
[29:33] less than a block to you have hundreds
[29:35] if not thousands of blocks to be able to
[29:37] Institute a recovery let's take a break
[29:39] for a moment and appreciate the beauty
[29:42] that coin vigilante has made with the
[29:45] Bitcoin watches those watches are the
[29:47] most amazing the most elegent way of
[29:50] showing that you are a true bitcoiner
[29:53] and coin vigilante just dropped a
[29:56] completely new and amazing Genesis
[29:58] edition of their watch collections you
[30:01] have the date of the first ever mined
[30:04] Bitcoin Block in there and of course
[30:07] also the block height and which EPO we
[30:10] are currently in I love the level of
[30:13] detail they put in in this masterpiece
[30:16] make sure to check out those amazing
[30:18] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[30:21] descriptions I love those watches so so
[30:24] much and now if you have Bitcoin I
[30:27] really do hope that you don't have it on
[30:29] Exchange but if you do have it on
[30:31] Exchange I have two ways for you to deal
[30:33] with that the first way is you put it on
[30:35] a hardware wallet that's the entry for
[30:38] you to get into the self- custody game I
[30:41] recommend bitbox Bitcoin only Edition
[30:44] for that it's a super simple and secure
[30:47] way and if you check out the link in the
[30:49] description you even get 5% off if you
[30:52] use the code Robin and the second way is
[30:55] the Bitcoin way the Bitcoin way is your
[30:59] Allin partner in terms of how to get the
[31:02] most out of your sovereignty they will
[31:05] personalize for you a self custody setup
[31:08] that is perfect for your individual
[31:11] situation they will show you how you can
[31:13] secure your own devices securing your
[31:16] Bitcoin is not enough you also have to
[31:18] keep all your devices secure one topic
[31:21] that is overlooked often is the
[31:23] inheritance plan what happens with your
[31:26] Bitcoin once you know no longer here do
[31:29] you have a plan for that in place
[31:31] already and last but not least if you're
[31:33] in a jurisdictions where you don't feel
[31:35] safe it's better to get a plan B for all
[31:38] that head over to the Bitcoin way.com
[31:42] robobin to get a 30 minute free call and
[31:46] just a quick side note I will be for the
[31:49] first time ever speaking at the Bitcoin
[31:51] prog event in June it will be absolutely
[31:55] legendary and I'm really looking forward
[31:57] to seeing all of you there you can get
[31:59] your ticket in the link down in the
[32:02] description of Bitcoin brag and very
[32:04] important use code Rob Robin to get 10%
[32:07] off your ticket I'm really looking
[32:09] forward seeing you there it's also an
[32:11] interesting conversation of like um now
[32:14] we are a small group of people uh we are
[32:19] basically in a very early stage of a
[32:21] very early early Revolution how will
[32:24] this look if we have all of the sudden
[32:26] four or five billion people
[32:28] wanting to interact with Bitcoin um how
[32:32] do you imagine that it's probably most
[32:35] not onchain I I guess like the most
[32:38] applications will be something above
[32:41] Bitcoin yeah so this goes I would say
[32:43] one step outside of my passion and my
[32:46] deeper intimate knowledge when it talks
[32:48] about scaling but you're going to In
[32:51] This World um I think ultimately you're
[32:54] you cannot have 5 billion people
[32:56] interact with Bitcoin on lay one it's a
[32:58] non-starter right that's just the nature
[33:00] of the size of the block space and uh
[33:04] the utxo set just the natural forcing
[33:07] function of um scarcity of the Bitcoin
[33:10] blocks themselves that you can achieve
[33:12] that so then you get into different
[33:14] models uh where you have different
[33:17] protocols that kind of act on top of
[33:19] layer one to be able to do this uh I
[33:21] think an example of what's working on
[33:22] this today is Arc right the idea that
[33:25] you can kind of uh have a virtual utxo
[33:27] that gets shared within a pool of people
[33:30] and then on occasion if you have a large
[33:31] enough balance you're going to be able
[33:33] to sovereignly withdraw at no point ever
[33:35] if I have 100 SATs is it ever going to
[33:38] make sense for me to unilaterally
[33:39] withdraw the layer one because you're
[33:41] going to below the dust limit right and
[33:43] you're gonna have to pay transaction
[33:44] fees when you claw it out of a system to
[33:46] be able to move it again on your own so
[33:48] there's going to be a natural floor
[33:49] that's going to be a combination of uh I
[33:52] would say basically the block space
[33:54] right at zero SATs at one sat per Vite
[33:56] right now you have lot of uh ability
[33:59] where it's only maybe a couple hundred
[34:01] STS to move a single signature
[34:03] transaction um in this world where we're
[34:05] thinking that more and more people we're
[34:07] talking billions of people interacting
[34:09] that those fee rates are going to be two
[34:12] if not you know eventually three orders
[34:13] of magnitude higher right you're talking
[34:14] like hundreds of SATs per Vite like we
[34:16] saw during a couple spikes last year
[34:18] while people were doing a lot of layer
[34:19] one speculation um designing these
[34:22] systems to be able to support that is
[34:25] going to come with just natural
[34:26] trade-offs for layer One Security in
[34:28] that not everyone's going to have layer
[34:29] one so how can you design systems at
[34:32] Layer Two to be able to kind of
[34:34] distribute uh it's less so Distributing
[34:36] the risk but making sure that um you can
[34:40] have natural Game Theory and kind of um
[34:42] evolution of these like layer two
[34:44] solutions that are going to be able to
[34:46] uh protect users at the end of the day
[34:47] right um it's something that like I said
[34:51] before is not my core area focus and
[34:53] expertise so it's definitely not
[34:54] something that I'm going to have a more
[34:56] prescriptive model of how that get
[34:58] accomplished uh I would say though that
[35:00] that's naturally the course of Bitcoin
[35:02] as it kind of permeates the Global
[35:04] Financial system in the world for
[35:06] payments yeah it's it's really
[35:08] interesting this question of like
[35:09] scaling Bitcoin it's also like it's so
[35:12] fun to watch the adoption uh moving
[35:14] forward in in life I just had uh two
[35:17] days ago or three days ago a
[35:19] conversation with someone that came into
[35:21] Bitcoin I think 2013 or 14 and he told
[35:24] the story of how he first bought Bitcoin
[35:26] he literally had to go to someone
[35:28] locally uh and he felt like a truck
[35:30] dealer because he was dealing with
[35:32] someone that he never know like and it
[35:34] felt illegally at that point and now we
[35:37] have come so far with like edfs with the
[35:39] exchanges with all those great services
[35:41] and and products around it uh and now I
[35:45] I mean maybe tomorrow for for the
[35:46] viewers that I listen to this probably
[35:49] like one two weeks old already uh uh the
[35:52] Strategic Bitcoin reserve and Nations
[35:54] buying it uh it it's kind of
[35:56] unbelievable where we are how do you
[35:58] look at um the the speed of of the
[36:01] adoption that that we currently
[36:03] witnessing are you kind of surprised of
[36:05] how fast things actually
[36:07] moving yeah it's interesting in the
[36:10] sense of like I mean there's that line
[36:12] we like to use gradually then suddenly
[36:14] right because you know what 2017 I
[36:17] thought it was inevitably like this is
[36:18] now it's happening we've arrived um
[36:21] we've definitely gone up a tier in kind
[36:23] of the level in the attention economy in
[36:25] global politics in macroeconomy like you
[36:29] know the focus of Bitcoin
[36:30] specifically um it's to
[36:34] me I I I think this is just part of
[36:36] natural hyperbitcoinization right more
[36:39] and more people are paying attention to
[36:40] it more people are interested in it I
[36:42] think over time too it's really
[36:43] interesting we're seeing is that Bitcoin
[36:45] dominance is also creating to like I
[36:47] think we're over 60 uh percent at the
[36:49] moment uh the larger ecosystem is also
[36:53] starting to be able to disambiguate and
[36:55] understand Bitcoin is something special
[36:56] I'm not if you saw um uh Jesse Pal from
[36:59] Kraken Brian Armstrong from coinbase and
[37:03] I forgot the third but like three us
[37:05] exchangers were basically saying yeah it
[37:07] should be a Bitcoin only reserve and
[37:09] it's funny because everyone's like oh
[37:10] look at this like all of these companies
[37:13] that list all these other coins are
[37:14] talking about you know uh it all has to
[37:17] be uh Bitcoin only I think they
[37:20] understand right and the reason why they
[37:22] understand is that if they're if they're
[37:23] at the adult table right you're talking
[37:25] with world leaders the last thing they
[37:28] want to do is have them as the
[37:30] Proprietors of the exchanges have them
[37:32] be bag holders for these random coins
[37:34] they know that Bitcoin in the long run
[37:35] is going to a crew value right they have
[37:37] extremely high confidence in their
[37:38] business is built on that most of their
[37:40] revenue
[37:42] though is is happening because of the
[37:44] buy and sell of all of these other coins
[37:46] right or you have maybe like a coinbase
[37:48] where they're they now have a lay or two
[37:50] of base right so they're trying to
[37:51] collect the transaction fees for kind of
[37:52] like this larger crypto economy they
[37:55] don't have as much confidence in the
[37:57] long-term acral value of that right
[38:00] there the way I view it is like they all
[38:01] have casinos and they collect a good
[38:03] rake when you uh do that um it's funny I
[38:08] have to think about that casino metaphor
[38:09] more because I used to play a lot of
[38:10] Poker and the thing with poker is that
[38:13] you're playing against other people
[38:14] you're not playing against the house so
[38:15] the house just takes a small little fee
[38:16] and they kind of just go about running
[38:18] their business whereas if you go out and
[38:19] play Slots there's a massive Edge where
[38:20] you're just dumping money into the house
[38:22] that's running the casino they know that
[38:24] Bitcoin is going to be the long-term
[38:25] winner so they know that if they're
[38:28] getting the adults sitting at the table
[38:29] they want those guys to be uh really
[38:32] happy in the long run over the course of
[38:34] like a decade or two that they made the
[38:35] right decision which would in in turn
[38:37] kind of give them more political
[38:39] Prestige and power and they're not going
[38:41] to get that if they have the random
[38:42] longtail of all these small coins that
[38:44] are in there that are going to be down
[38:46] and so uh I think it's effective
[38:48] branding I think it's total uh on the
[38:50] narrative the mimic narrative Wars
[38:52] capitulation that Bitcoin is a deao
[38:54] store of value you can just look at the
[38:55] eth BTC trading pair over the past
[38:57] couple years right in the increasing
[38:59] Bitcoin dominance um it's exciting times
[39:02] I think like a lot of things that we
[39:04] were saying in our little corner of
[39:06] bitcoiners that were seen as uh
[39:09] heterodox to the whole like crypto
[39:12] industry we've had years and years of
[39:14] playing these narratives out this point
[39:15] and over time our thesis has being shown
[39:17] to be
[39:18] correct that's an interesting as
[39:20] perspective of like the game theory of
[39:23] people that understand Bitcoin and
[39:25] crypto they also understand and that if
[39:28] they say all like we have to do those
[39:30]  coins and if if if president
[39:33] actually acting on that and they go to
[39:34]  it's it's it falls back on them so
[39:38] they don't want to recommend anything
[39:40] else in Bitcoin because they can rely on
[39:42] the value of Bitcoin I never thought
[39:44] about that actually it's an interesting
[39:46] INF aspect of of uh Casino
[39:50] leaders yeah because right like they're
[39:52] making money on Dogecoin CU Dogecoin is
[39:55] not going up it's CU people are buying
[39:56] and selling Dogecoin all the time
[39:57] speculating but a strategic Reserve is a
[40:00] long-term held asset so the exchanges
[40:02] don't even have an opportunity to make
[40:04] money as it relates to buying and
[40:05] selling because it's not like you're
[40:07] going to have a daily like portfolio
[40:08] manager who's like longing one and
[40:10] shorting the other it's supposed to sit
[40:12] there and do nothing right which is
[40:14] Bitcoin superpower is sitting there and
[40:15] doing nothing uh so you have a total
[40:17] different Divergence where they're
[40:19] retail facing business and kind of their
[40:21] Enterprise facing businesses getting
[40:23] people to speculate for a long-term held
[40:25] asset the performance metric is does the
[40:27] price go up over time and for everything
[40:29] else the answer is no right you have
[40:31] volatility and spikes and up and down
[40:33] but they're long and if you zoom out
[40:35] it's down and to the right on the price
[40:36] charts for all of those whereas Bitcoin
[40:37] is up and to the right uh it just makes
[40:39] sense there for sure what does the um
[40:44] ETF paired with like the ETF second year
[40:48] paired with a possible strategic Bitcoin
[40:51] Reserve now mean for how how close we
[40:53] are to this hyperbitcoinization this
[40:56] this suddenly moment that you said
[40:58] before I still like if you ask me I
[41:01] still think we're a decade out at least
[41:03] uh this is Bitcoin is a$2 trillion doll
[41:06] asset right now that's a puddle in the
[41:09] ocean of global Capital markets it's
[41:11] still so early and we could have a 10x
[41:13] and still be on the early side of that
[41:14] conversation right so for me this is
[41:16] just kind of climbing like B basically
[41:20] Bitcoin gets promoted and gets to sit at
[41:21] a larger and larger table um and this is
[41:25] just the beginning of that it's it's the
[41:26] beginning of the next stage of the game
[41:28] the next level of the game is just
[41:29] starting uh and it's going to take a
[41:31] longer time Horizon for it to all play
[41:33] out um I think it's validation of the
[41:35] thesis and that if you were having this
[41:38] conversation you know in 2017 you said
[41:41] you've been around Bitcoin for five
[41:42] years if five years ago you got in
[41:43] you're like oh in five years you're
[41:46] going to have World governments that are
[41:47] going to be coming in and buying Bitcoin
[41:49] and thinking about that and they'll be
[41:51] accessible to all all traders in the
[41:52] world through stock
[41:54] wrappers you'd uh you'd be like wow
[41:56] that's like that's amazing like that's
[41:58] huge progress right so like we're just
[41:59] validating like the next step that our
[42:01] thesis 5 years ago is we're on the
[42:03] trajectory of being more right than
[42:05] wrong so we're gonna have to do another
[42:06] round or two of this you know it's going
[42:08] to take time still I don't uh think it's
[42:10] happening tomorrow uh if it is I'm ready
[42:13] for it but uh I think it's just going to
[42:16] naturally we're going to keep riding
[42:17] volatility and we're going to keep on
[42:19] climbing and growing uh and it's going
[42:22] to be really exciting kind of seeing how
[42:23] this next level plays out I I do agree
[42:26] with that a lot and I see it like that
[42:28] and that's why it's actually surprises
[42:31] me so much that the USA is now moving in
[42:34] like I expected when I think about uh
[42:38] the Nations Game Theory uh El Salvador
[42:42] was kind of expected that like a country
[42:44] like that tries things out like that and
[42:47] then maybe like a um a smaller country
[42:51] like Budan is basically doing that they
[42:53] have for their size of their country a
[42:55] massive amount of of of Bitcoin if you
[42:57] compare the the size of the country with
[42:59] with how many Bitcoin they have uh but
[43:02] America is just surprising me so much if
[43:05] like why are they moving they have no I
[43:08] mean they have the biggest
[43:11] feat bag to secure but they
[43:15] have the I thought they will be at the
[43:18] end of the adoption cycle and not at the
[43:21] beginning of the adoption cycle well
[43:23] it's funny right um I'm an American
[43:27] right I'm uh I would say a proud
[43:29] American I think uh the many of the
[43:31] great things about America are you know
[43:33] it's free and open markets and I
[43:36] actually think the I tweeted this the
[43:38] other day the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve
[43:39] is not the US government holding it it's
[43:42] families holding it right it's
[43:43] businesses holding it right and from a
[43:45] capital Market perspective it is
[43:47] interesting to see that the US is trying
[43:48] to like lead the way on this where you
[43:50] would have thought they'd be at the end
[43:51] because they have the most to lose with
[43:53] the you know the losing of the Petro
[43:55] dollar and the like the global dollar as
[43:57] like the world Reserve
[43:59] currency I think the the problem with
[44:03] that is unless we get an act of Congress
[44:05] the next Administration can come in and
[44:07] undo everything that's being done right
[44:08] now right so you very well could have
[44:11] some strategic Bitcoin Reserve set up
[44:13] and then in four years it's being
[44:15] Unwound um and that's why I think in the
[44:18] long run the actual strategic Bitcoin
[44:19] Reserve are the people the individuals
[44:21] the businesses Capital allocators who
[44:24] are holding in Bitcoin they've held
[44:25] Bitcoin for a very long time and they're
[44:26] not looking to sell anytime soon um I
[44:30] think in the it's interesting and I
[44:32] think this actually goes to a bit of the
[44:34] natural disruptive nature of America the
[44:36] culture of America right where um you
[44:39] have Elon Musk you have David saak you
[44:41] have all these like entrepr serial
[44:42] entrepreneurs that are now kind of like
[44:44] in the administration they're trying to
[44:45] move fast and break things and try and
[44:46] disrupt themselves this is like the
[44:48] innovators dilemma the idea that if
[44:50] you're like the market leader it's
[44:51] harder for you to be able to come in and
[44:52] figure out the next new thing because
[44:54] you're incentivized in the way your
[44:56] corporation operates
[44:57] to uh not kind of really ultimately
[45:00] break the mold um but the flip side of
[45:03] that coin in American dynamism is that
[45:05] you have all these startups and you have
[45:07] all these companies and people that are
[45:08] thinking about how do we kind of uh
[45:10] attack the incumbents in a way that we
[45:11] can provide more value to end users and
[45:14] you can just that as Bitcoin Bitcoin is
[45:15] a better value proposition to the end
[45:16] users that are actually holding
[45:17] currencies for the long run uh and so
[45:20] with that like I think it's interesting
[45:22] to see that the US is dabbling in there
[45:24] I'm I'm going to have medium to low
[45:26] confidence until it's an actual act of
[45:28] Congress and that's just the nature of
[45:29] just how America and our judicial and
[45:31] our legal system and the whole process
[45:33] of our Constitution and how laws
[45:35] actually get created if you want
[45:36] something to be sticky you need Congress
[45:38] to actually be there because anything
[45:39] that a president unilaterally does the
[45:40] next one can just unilaterally
[45:42] undo yeah it's it's also interesting the
[45:45] concept of like Grassroots adoption
[45:47] versus institutional and government
[45:49] adoption uh where you as a bitcoiner you
[45:53] actually want the the families of
[45:55] America to hold as many Bitcoin as
[45:57] possible and not the government again
[46:00] that that that like the I'm I'm way more
[46:03] happy if someone and the family adopts
[46:06] Bitcoin then uh the government adopting
[46:08] it and holding it in kind of like for
[46:11] the citizen like that's is a an almost
[46:14] an anti- Bitcoin
[46:17] thing yeah it's uh you know like I said
[46:20] it's part of that culture just in
[46:22] America of uh the cowboy the
[46:24] entrepreneur the businessman like
[46:25] whatever you want to say like uh
[46:27] and what I also love about that too just
[46:29] thinking about from the risk side it's
[46:30] distribution of risk all the coins
[46:31] aren't sitting in one place right
[46:33] distribution of keys is good for the
[46:34] health of the
[46:35] network absolutely I have an interesting
[46:38] question that uh that I recently uh got
[46:41] myself and I was like I want to bring it
[46:43] into a podcast and I think maybe with
[46:46] you it's the it's perfect guest um if
[46:49] Satoshi return today what do you think
[46:53] he would critique the most about Bitcoin
[46:55] huh
[46:58] if Satoshi were to come back today what
[47:00] would be his biggest critique it's a
[47:01] hard question to answer
[47:04] because I think anyone who would answer
[47:07] this question would basically be
[47:09] smuggling their own opinion into the
[47:11] answer and be like well Satoshi would
[47:13] agree with me obviously right so like
[47:15] the question the question's a hard one
[47:17] to try and answer honestly like I never
[47:20] spoke to Satoshi I've read his email
[47:21] posts and stuff it's hard for me to have
[47:23] a read on what his thoughts were um it's
[47:26] a tough question and and now that I've
[47:29] kind of uh revealed the thought process
[47:31] of trying to not smuggle my own opinion
[47:33] into what I think Satoshi would say um I
[47:37] think if if I were to say in the
[47:39] evaluation of Bitcoin I think just being
[47:43] more open-minded to how other people are
[47:45] using it right um when he disabled a
[47:49] bunch of op codes back in 2011 right
[47:50] before he left the project he was
[47:52] concerned not of people using Bitcoin
[47:55] for use cases that everyone wouldn't
[47:57] agree on but it was a concern of it
[47:59] would literally crash the network right
[48:02] um it's hard to say too because Satoshi
[48:04] had such limited information when he was
[48:06] a steward of the project right in 2011
[48:08] when he left like mining pools were like
[48:11] not really a thing like like Central
[48:12] like it was still mostly like CPU and G
[48:14] it was GPU miners right that's why he
[48:16] actually chides llo for uh doing the GPU
[48:20] mining at first because he and I think
[48:22] this is actually if I were to speculate
[48:24] like probably had some familiar toi had
[48:27] some familiarity with Hardware he
[48:28] probably understood that you could use a
[48:30] GPU to kind of mine faster but it was
[48:32] good for the health of the network if
[48:33] any random computer could get turned on
[48:35] in mind Bitcoin and so because of that
[48:38] um he kind of chides llo for kind of
[48:40] opening up Pandora's Box and then you
[48:42] kind of go down the rout of as6 and
[48:43] Mining pools and this kind of
[48:45] concentration um and maybe that's
[48:48] actually a safe one kind of the stuff
[48:49] that people are doing at Ocean for being
[48:51] able to disambiguate between mining
[48:53] pools and the actual person who creates
[48:54] the block template it's good for the
[48:56] network that you don't have like
[48:57] basically nine people n nine entities
[48:59] who that pick blocks maybe less if you
[49:01] look at how they're aggregating under
[49:02] the hood I think that's a I think that's
[49:04] a good one that I think that's actually
[49:05] a really good safe one that he would
[49:06] want to have more because that's
[49:08] something that has a market Dynamic that
[49:10] evolved after he left he would probably
[49:12] want to have a strong critique on the
[49:13] fact that um we need to have more
[49:16] distribution in who's proposing block
[49:17] templates for the mining pools yeah like
[49:20] stratum V2 stuff I think that's actually
[49:21] a really safe one that isn't really kind
[49:23] of talking my own perspective in POV and
[49:26] something that developed entirely after
[49:27] he left would be that organization of
[49:29] block
[49:30] propagation yeah probably like the all
[49:33] the things that go in the in the
[49:35] direction of like let's make this thing
[49:37] more decentralized more robust uh and
[49:40] that's is a really good one like the
[49:41] ocean topic comes up the last couple of
[49:44] months more and more in the podcast I
[49:47] really like it um we have one question
[49:49] that I ask each and every one of my
[49:50] guests and the question is uh what can
[49:53] we learn from you besides
[49:55] Bitcoin what could you learn from me
[49:57] besides Bitcoin interesting um I have
[50:00] some fun answers I'm trying to think uh
[50:02] through a couple of them I mean learn as
[50:04] if like you and I spent a couple hours
[50:06] together we learn or like like a lesson
[50:07] or something that isn't uh that isn't
[50:10] just Bitcoin like like I I usually is it
[50:13] like if you sat down for six hours I
[50:15] could teach you something or is it like
[50:16] a parting thought of something you can
[50:17] learn that isn't related to bitcoin it's
[50:20] interesting because those are the two
[50:21] things you could go down and I see
[50:23] guests answering in in in both Direction
[50:26] but I my
[50:27] original attention was more of like an
[50:30] an in skill and and something like an an
[50:34] area like what what are you also
[50:37] passionate about outside of Bitcoin is
[50:39] is probably like a a different way to
[50:41] say it so I I have a couple I'll list
[50:43] off like um I've been working a lot with
[50:45] um I mean I was previously a data
[50:47] scientist and a programmer before
[50:48] getting into Bitcoin fulltime so
[50:50] understanding how to like
[50:52] architect big big cloud Enterprise
[50:55] systems being able to do data analysis
[50:58] uh automating tasks um but maybe a fun
[51:01] one I'll just go for is uh I'd teach you
[51:03] how to count cards it's actually not
[51:05] that hard I used to uh my favorite
[51:07] professor in math professor in college
[51:09] was what part of the MIT card counting
[51:11] team so I'd go to his office hours and
[51:13] it's actually very simple arithmetic of
[51:14] plus and minus um but the actual fun for
[51:17] me whenever I was doing it was it wasn't
[51:19] the mathematical like I'm going to make
[51:21] money it was the social game you had to
[51:24] play to not uh draw attention to
[51:25] yourself and understanding how to behave
[51:27] in a in in a controlled environment to
[51:30] not come off as someone who's trying to
[51:32] account cards uh and that's a fun
[51:34] activity that you could probably you
[51:36] know with a couple thousand dollars you
[51:37] could um make some positive EV bets and
[51:40] uh come out with a little bit before you
[51:41] get put into a database it's a fun you
[51:43] know it's just like one of those fun
[51:45] things yeah it's I also love I never
[51:49] talked about that on my podcast but I
[51:51] actually love doing small magic tricks
[51:54] like like the just like learning a small
[51:56] all uh um C trick to to see if we can do
[52:00] because it's it's mostly just about um
[52:03] not not bringing attention to the small
[52:06] trick that you do within like a five
[52:08] minute presentation uh so people are
[52:10] like oh like he actually that did that
[52:12] because there's always like some small
[52:13] thing that you have to do like a double
[52:14] lift or something like that uh so I I I
[52:18] do like that a lot out outside of
[52:20] Bitcoin and actually someone asked me
[52:22] recently what would you do if if you
[52:24] couldn't talk about Bitcoin I was like
[52:26] uh yeah I sounds interesting but maybe I
[52:28] just go down a fun Rabbit Hole of magic
[52:30] tricks and open YouTube channel nice
[52:35] yeah I have one more uh question because
[52:38] of data scientist what is the what are
[52:41] the the the the metrics that you're
[52:44] looking into when you look at Bitcoin of
[52:46] like are you looking at the hash rate
[52:48] are are you looking at uh at some
[52:50] metrics of Bitcoin uh regular to to see
[52:53] where where Bitcoin is going no I I
[52:55] don't actually it's funny enough with my
[52:57] background I don't look too much at the
[52:59] onchain analytics of things um I think
[53:01] the most interesting ones just matter of
[53:03] factly are like the hoddle waves that
[53:05] the unchain team puts out are just very
[53:07] clear concrete observable patterns on
[53:09] how the velocity of coins and how long
[53:11] people are holding them for um I think
[53:13] it's a great visual too to be able to
[53:14] tell a story uh that's a great one that
[53:17] to be able to show and it's also the
[53:19] nature of it isn't requires a lot of
[53:22] time as opposed to like oh hash rates up
[53:24] hash rates down coins are moving to and
[53:26] from changes like it's kind of like this
[53:28] chaotic frenzy all the time uh getting a
[53:31] larger sample size reducing variance and
[53:33] seeing the long-term trends I think are
[53:35] more interesting so like the hotle wave
[53:36] stuff for sure really cool uh I do like
[53:40] that also I think the last time talk M
[53:43] check made it that was uh the onchain
[53:45] stuff is really fascinating but uh it's
[53:48] it's also not my world totally but I
[53:51] thought maybe you're into it because of
[53:53] the data science background no yeah um
[53:56] really cool we have one uh last end
[53:57] routine in the podcast where the
[53:58] previous guest is asking a question for
[54:00] the next guest without knowing who the
[54:01] next guest actually is okay uh we
[54:03] touched on it today already but uh what
[54:05] is the most exciting thing about
[54:07] lightning most exciting thing about
[54:09] lightning for me I think it's what I
[54:11] love about lightning is that it they
[54:14] can't like the the Bitcoin Community
[54:16] came together to leverage Bitcoin script
[54:19] into a way that you can do a new scaling
[54:21] solution right lightning got three soft
[54:24] Forks to get enabled it got two time
[54:26] lock op codes thatr 2014 2015 and it got
[54:29] segt in 2017 and I think it's a really
[54:31] powerful use case of showing that when
[54:34] the community comes together in
[54:35] understanding different use cases that
[54:37] you can actually enable whole new design
[54:39] paradigms on how Bitcoin can function uh
[54:44] with that that that was not part of the
[54:45] original Vision right you can kind of
[54:47] like over time kind of expand the
[54:49] perception of what's possible and I
[54:51] think lightning up to this point is the
[54:52] best possible use case for that I also
[54:54] love that it's um Anonymous payment for
[54:56] the sender I think it's a great way to
[54:58] be able to do instant settlement I you
[55:00] know going to bitcoin Park and buying my
[55:02] Seltzer every day and just like throwing
[55:03] a thousand SATs into the BTC pay
[55:05] terminal like it's it's an amazing
[55:07] experience like I'm using Bitcoin all
[55:09] the time and it lowers that friction to
[55:10] be able to kind of spend with it
