[00:00] price predictions they're quite
[00:01] fruitless because you're pricing a
[00:03] finitely scarce asset and an infinitely
[00:06] printable currency so then you're
[00:07] talking about Infinity divided by 21
[00:09] million infinity divided by any number
[00:11] is infinity Bitcoin has proven to be
[00:13] over its first 15 years the best
[00:15] transfer value across time in the long
[00:17] run and because Fiat falls short in the
[00:20] area of transferring value effectively
[00:22] over time that makes it vulnerable to
[00:24] being replaced the final Domino would be
[00:26] Global unit of account so everything is
[00:28] priced in Bitcoin about Bitcoin reaching
[00:31] 100K which I view as an imitability
[00:33] within the next 12 months and then
[00:34] you're talking about Bitcoin reaching
[00:36] you know 250k or so to where Satoshi
[00:39] Nakamoto owner of about 1.1 million
[00:41] Bitcoins then becomes the richest person
[00:44] in the world their lives are literally
[00:46] being stolen from them because of the
[00:48] inflationary nature of US dollar and all
[00:51] Fiat currencies it breaks the chain
[00:53] between central banks and citizens and
[00:55] it free citizens as a result then you're
[00:57] talking about the free market being
[00:58] Unleashed because we you United on free
[01:01] money we're United on a standard
[01:02] measurement of value that can never be
[01:04] manipulated and that can be understood
[01:05] anywhere in the world on a global
[01:07] digital immutable level and that's
[01:09] protected from any manipulation or
[01:10] centralized evil
[01:12] [Music]
[01:15] authorities I've noticed in the past
[01:18] couple of weeks or months the the price
[01:20] predictions got more I feel like I don't
[01:23] know if you also noticed that um but
[01:26] I've also seen that you had I just
[01:28] researched quickly and I saw like some
[01:30] articles I didn't even know if this is
[01:31] an a recent article of yours um but
[01:34] there a general questions do you think
[01:36] that um price predictions in itself is
[01:40] is just a good marketing tool or do you
[01:42] think that uh price predictions also
[01:44] like the power law we have the plan uh
[01:46] the stuct to flow like there are so many
[01:48] different models to go there is it does
[01:50] this serve a bigger picture bigger
[01:53] purpose or is it just like
[01:55] marketing yeah it's a really good
[01:57] question I think price predictions
[02:00] ultimately are fruitless but I think
[02:02] price also is the ultimate signal for
[02:06] bitcoiners and not not necessarily
[02:08] bitcoiners but Bitcoin adoption and
[02:10] people coming onto the market and
[02:13] becoming
[02:14] bitcoiners like if you were to take the
[02:16] Bitcoin price completely out of the
[02:17] equation how would you even value it
[02:19] then and then what would be the signal
[02:21] of bitcoin's value and how would it be
[02:23] represented okay this is the best
[02:24] performing asset ever if there wasn't
[02:26] any price to represent that then we
[02:28] would have really no sign for it price
[02:31] predictions again I think they're quite
[02:33] fruitless because you're pricing a fin
[02:37] nightly scarce asset and an infinitely
[02:39] printable currency so then you're
[02:41] talking about Infinity divided by 21
[02:43] million and infinity divided by any
[02:46] number is infinity so I think and I've
[02:49] written about that before on Twitter
[02:50] that's really the
[02:51] ultimate mathematical price Model is
[02:54] just Infinity divided by 21 million and
[02:56] then you get out of okay stop pricing
[02:58] Bitcoin in US dollars or Euros
[03:01] argentinan pay sales whatever it is and
[03:04] you start pricing it in all the world's
[03:07] productivity well that number is also
[03:09] infinite and as any hardcore Bitcoin
[03:12] knows then you're talking about the true
[03:14] value of Bitcoin which is infinity
[03:17] divided by 21 million because Bitcoin
[03:20] will be Global money and'll price in all
[03:21] of the world's productivity and then you
[03:23] get an infinite value assigned to all
[03:27] the Bitcoin what about pricing Bitcoin
[03:31] in how many houses you can buy or how
[03:34] many ounces of gold you can buy is that
[03:37] make does it make more sense yeah I
[03:39] think it makes more sense what can I go
[03:41] out and exchange my Bitcoin for at the
[03:43] end of the day that's what we're using
[03:46] Bitcoin for it's great to hold it but if
[03:47] we can't go out and exchange it for
[03:49] anything it's not serving its purpose as
[03:51] money it can store value over time great
[03:55] but if then we have to go and exchange
[03:56] it for something else then becomes a
[03:58] little bit vulnerable to being replaced
[04:00] because then it doesn't transfer value
[04:02] over space or scales which is what
[04:05] money's used for which is what bitcoin's
[04:07] main aim is so if you can price Bitcoin
[04:10] in houses and say well this house was
[04:13] worth 20 Bitcoins five years ago and
[04:15] it's worth two Bitcoins today and let's
[04:18] say you had 20 Bitcoins five years ago
[04:20] and you saved up well now you can buy 10
[04:22] houses or you can just buy the one and
[04:24] have Bitcoin left over and this is
[04:26] getting into actually what savings is
[04:29] swich to be used for it's allowed it's
[04:32] supposed to allow you to plan for your
[04:34] future effectively which I've written
[04:36] about recently on
[04:38] Twitter ah interesting do do you see uh
[04:42] I mean obviously you see Bitcoin as as
[04:44] the best store of value do you also see
[04:46] it as as longterm as like the best
[04:48] currency as the best med of exchange
[04:51] yeah certainly I think really the space
[04:54] and scales part because money is the
[04:58] good asset whatever ever you want to
[05:00] call it that transfers value the most
[05:02] effectively across space scales and time
[05:06] and space would be okay I take it from
[05:07] Puerto Rico to Austria I take it from
[05:10] the United States to Africa wherever it
[05:13] is I want to take my money with me so
[05:15] that I can participate in the economy no
[05:17] matter where I'm at okay and then scales
[05:19] is okay I want to buy a house but I also
[05:21] want to buy a pack of go can I use money
[05:22] to group it together to buy the house
[05:24] and I divide it down to buy the packing
[05:26] bill we've really solved the space and
[05:28] scales part already with digital money
[05:31] in its current form in the US dollar we
[05:33] can divide it just with you know a
[05:35] couple of Taps on a
[05:37] keyboard with with uh Fiat but the issue
[05:43] with Fiat is transferring value over
[05:44] time and that's where Bitcoin comes in
[05:47] and Bitcoin is proven to be over its
[05:49] first 15 years the best transfer value
[05:52] across time in the long run and because
[05:55] Fiat fall short in the area of
[05:58] transferring value effectively over time
[06:00] that makes it vulnerable to being
[06:01] replaced by a currency a good a monetary
[06:05] asset that does transfer effectively
[06:08] over time because logically any Market
[06:10] participant wants to transfer their
[06:13] value effectively over time if they go
[06:14] out and expend 40 hours in a week and
[06:17] they get paid let's say $100 then that
[06:19] $100 becomes worth $90 next year or they
[06:23] can get paid in $100 worth of bitcoin
[06:25] let's call it one Bitcoin for
[06:26] convenience sake and then the Bitcoin
[06:29] appreciate to $110 worth well you're
[06:32] going to take the one that appreciates
[06:34] your value more over time logically and
[06:36] so we're seeing that play out and
[06:38] because Bitcoin is digital it solves the
[06:41] space and scales problem and it's also
[06:44] you know decentralized and there's many
[06:46] other factors to it as well that
[06:47] protects those
[06:49] properties but it's really solving the
[06:51] transfer of value over time and that's
[06:55] ultimately why it'll replace the dollar
[06:58] and any other currency because it is the
[06:59] best transfer value over time because of
[07:03] its finite scarce properties and because
[07:06] of the decentralized secure properties
[07:09] of the network that protect those
[07:12] properties I I I like a lot those um
[07:15] comparisons the historical comparison
[07:17] with like how new technology um replaced
[07:23] uh old technology when we have like from
[07:26] landlines to cell phones when we have
[07:28] like from horses to cars like all those
[07:30] things they all kind of follow this
[07:32] similar S curve adoption uh and I mean
[07:36] everyone is well aware of that like the
[07:37] internet also um do do you see that like
[07:41] the timing is always really interesting
[07:43] and it's also the hardest to predict uh
[07:46] and to look out in the future when you
[07:47] look out like maybe five years then okay
[07:49] look out like 10 15 years uh on the one
[07:53] side we have like this this is this feat
[07:56] monster this feat thing that's kind of
[07:58] really bad but like everyone still uses
[08:00] it and it's there's still a monopoly on
[08:02] it um what's your current uh status of
[08:07] of fear when you would like maybe let's
[08:09] do this um if you think of fear as a
[08:12] human being and a human being at at some
[08:14] point just dies um how far how far is
[08:18] that human being is it like 50 years old
[08:21] is like 70 years old what what do you
[08:23] say is the the current mental and health
[08:26] status of of fear well let's say well
[08:30] the way I like to try to predict quote
[08:33] unquote Bitcoin adoption is with a
[08:35] normal distribution curve because you're
[08:37] talking about Fiat that's existed
[08:40] officially for 53 years now but really
[08:43] the manipulation of money has existed
[08:46] for much longer FAL Reserve officially
[08:48] enacted in 1913 but money was still
[08:51] being manipulated prior to prior to that
[08:54] plenty so you're talking about a
[08:55] monetary system that's been entr
[08:57] trenched for quite some time versus a
[08:59] monetary system that started from
[09:01] literal zero with Bitcoin 15 years ago
[09:04] in 2009 so it's not going to happen
[09:06] overnight but again the way I like to
[09:09] think about when the kind of shift plays
[09:12] out in terms of Bitcoin becoming Global
[09:15] money and replacing the dollar as a
[09:16] reserve currency and really replacing
[09:18] all Fiat currencies is with that normal
[09:21] distribution curve and
[09:23] so my far left tail end which would be
[09:28] the quickest for Bitcoin to be adopted I
[09:30] would put as
[09:32] 2027 I think you're starting to see some
[09:35] political discussions already with us
[09:38] presidential candidates I.E Trump that
[09:41] are supporting Bitcoin
[09:44] because you know Trump Bitcoin doesn't
[09:46] need Trump but Trump needs Bitcoin and
[09:48] you're going to see political candidates
[09:51] start to increasingly understand that
[09:53] they need Bitcoin if they want to get
[09:55] elected to office which is the name of
[09:57] the game for politicians they like
[09:58] getting
[09:59] so they're going to continue to Pander
[10:01] to bitcoiners and especially because
[10:03] bitcoiners are single issue voters I.E
[10:06] they want money separated from state
[10:08] which is what Bitcoin
[10:09] does they're only going to vote for the
[10:11] candidates that support their beliefs
[10:14] and so you're going to see an increasing
[10:16] amount of politicians that do that
[10:17] already so you're already seeing that
[10:19] and it could be as quick as 2027 again
[10:22] that's far left tail end for me I would
[10:24] say far right tail end in terms of the
[10:27] slowest would be something like
[10:30] maybe 25 years from now we'll call it
[10:32] 2050 I'd be really really stunned if it
[10:35] took basically 40 years for Bitcoin to
[10:38] be adopted because technology is
[10:41] compounding
[10:42] exponentially and the
[10:44] internet took much less longer to reach
[10:47] basically 60% adoption and and that's
[10:49] really most of the Civilized world and
[10:51] as Technologies continue to spread and
[10:54] the internet becomes more accessible in
[10:56] remote locations then people have a
[10:58] greater access to bitcoin which is
[11:01] leveraging the internet so if it took
[11:04] another 25 years that would really stun
[11:06] me but my kind of middle third of the
[11:08] distribution which is where I think the
[11:11] most likely chance most likely time
[11:13] frame is for Bitcoin to be adopted would
[11:15] be about 10 to 15 years so I'd say 2034
[11:19] to
[11:19] 2039 is kind of that time frame which
[11:23] would put Fiat as a human being let's
[11:26] say the average life expectancy well the
[11:28] average life expectancy F I believe is
[11:30] about 50 years somewhere around that
[11:32] number and we're at 53 right now so
[11:35] technically it's already past de but
[11:39] under the normal distribution Curve
[11:41] Model that I that I like to use it gives
[11:43] it about a 10 15E lifespan but it could
[11:46] all happen so quickly because you're
[11:48] talking about a debt spiral that we're
[11:49] in right now that's in a immensely
[11:52] negative feedback loop it's only
[11:54] continuing to get worse and that's not a
[11:59] United States issue it's a global issue
[12:01] with all these debt based currencies so
[12:03] it could happen you know overnight some
[12:05] people like to say it could happen the
[12:07] way you fall asleep slowly then all at
[12:09] once I think that makes sense too it's
[12:12] interesting because 2035 would also be
[12:14] the moment when I'm not mistaken where
[12:17] 99% of all Bitcoin Supply would be mine
[12:19] so like there's like some significance
[12:22] there would be interesting to see then
[12:23] the last 1% takes like 100 years yeah um
[12:27] it's uh would been interesting time what
[12:30] do you mean with like when Bitcoin gets
[12:32] adopted like what what does this mean is
[12:34] like fi and we all use Bitcoin to
[12:36] transact or what does it mean that
[12:38] Bitcoin is fully adopted yeah fully
[12:40] adopted for me the the final Domino
[12:44] would be Global uni of account so
[12:46] everything is priced in Bitcoin houses
[12:48] cars gallons of milk food whatever it is
[12:53] that you're paying everything is priced
[12:55] in Bitcoin everything's denominated in
[12:56] Bitcoin all over the world that would be
[12:59] the
[13:00] final unit of that would be the final
[13:02] dominant would be the unit of account
[13:04] and that would come shortly after
[13:06] becoming the global Medi exchange and I
[13:08] think I came across this idea I believe
[13:11] on Twitter a few weeks ago where someone
[13:14] mentioned the possibility or maybe they
[13:16] were clamoring for the idea for
[13:20] countries and really the world as a
[13:23] human species to come together and kind
[13:24] of sign on to a constitu esque style of
[13:30] document that just declares Bitcoin is
[13:32] money for the world and everyone kind of
[13:35] signs on to that which I thought was
[13:37] interesting something that kind of it's
[13:39] akin to the Declaration of Independence
[13:41] we're we're separating from King George
[13:43] the manipulators the scammers the ones
[13:46] that are debasing our money and taxing
[13:51] us to Oblivion etc etc and so we kind of
[13:53] declare away from that and unite along
[13:56] this monetary standard which I think is
[13:57] it's a cool idea
[14:00] that's really cool idea I mean 2035 uh
[14:04] it seems very aggressive for me but at
[14:08] the same time I'm like this this this
[14:10] feed system is like it it it it existed
[14:14] so long already like this 50 year um
[14:17] like every year we're not in
[14:19] hyperinflation and we're not at uh
[14:22] people in the street demonstrating
[14:24] against the Federal Reserve it it
[14:26] fascinates me that we are still not
[14:28] there like when I thought when I saw
[14:30] everything coming together in in like
[14:32] 2020 where with Co and everything I was
[14:34] like oh yeah like in one two maximum
[14:36] three years we we have massive uh
[14:39] strikes on the streets and we will have
[14:42] massive hyperinflation I'm I'm kind of
[14:44] amazed that we don't have it till now
[14:47] well I think a big part of it
[14:49] is because the dollar is the Kingpin and
[14:53] it is the global Reserve currency they
[14:56] being the US let's call the US us
[14:59] monetary system they have the benefit of
[15:02] exporting their dollars and their
[15:04] inflation to other countries and that
[15:06] really is the greatest export of the
[15:07] United States is the dollar whereas you
[15:09] take a country like
[15:11] Argentina that prints their country to
[15:13] Oblivion prce their country Prince their
[15:16] money to Oblivion that that all of those
[15:18] pesos we'll call them dollars they stay
[15:21] within that country they don't get
[15:22] exported out and used elsewhere and so
[15:24] they feel the effects uh much harder
[15:27] than American citizens just in the
[15:29] country because those dollars in the
[15:31] states are sent to Honduras they're sent
[15:34] to Mexico they're sent all over the
[15:37] world Cayman Islands wherever it is and
[15:41] because of that we don't necessarily
[15:43] feel it as much but if you go to other
[15:45] countries their their economies are
[15:49] getting destroyed by inflation because
[15:51] they can't circulate their printed money
[15:54] outside of their country so it's it's a
[15:57] harsh reality for the states but it's
[15:59] the best reality of all the Fiat
[16:00] currencies but it's harsh all the way
[16:03] around really it's it's um and and
[16:07] there's also like uh there's a lot of
[16:10] interesting things here because um
[16:13] that's it's very true that for example
[16:15] in the states or even like in Europe
[16:17] it's it's kind of inflation is kind of
[16:19] in control like uh I don't go into the
[16:22] supermarket and I'm like oh [ __ ] the
[16:24] prices are massively Rising like you
[16:25] don't notice it if you don't look
[16:27] exactly in there but then there are also
[16:29] countries like not that far away from me
[16:31] like turkey uh turkey has like an
[16:34] official inflation rate of over 100% so
[16:37] inofficial is probably like 200% or
[16:39] maybe even above that depends on on what
[16:41] metrics you're looking at um and they
[16:44] are still not like I mean they're
[16:46] probably more inclined to bitcoin and uh
[16:49] but uh I I talked with I think like two
[16:51] or three people already from Turkey on
[16:53] the podcast uh and and they're going
[16:56] towards like gold and and and land
[17:00] whatever like those kind of things why
[17:02] even in in those countries
[17:04] too what do we need to do that that
[17:07] people get Bitcoin like is is it just
[17:09] like time and and and will will that
[17:11] actually be done because there's like
[17:14] two hearts in me like the one heart is
[17:16] like oh it will be so quick like we have
[17:18] the internet and it's so obvious once
[17:20] you get it you really quickly me it took
[17:23] me like one year from Bitcoin is a scam
[17:25] to I'm all in Bitcoin like this
[17:27] transformation took like one year from
[17:28] me
[17:29] um and it's just like a bunch of
[17:31] podcasts books anything like that so I'm
[17:34] like yeah we I can see it in like 5 10
[17:36] years that we are really quick at this
[17:38] adoption rate but then I also look at uh
[17:41] friends and families and and even like
[17:44] people in turkey that I talked to that
[17:46] they hear about Bitcoin since like five
[17:48] six years all over again and they always
[17:50] like ah it's expensive and all all those
[17:53] weird things um it's there are a lot of
[17:56] thoughts around that like what what do
[17:58] you think about that
[17:59] yeah there are a lot of thoughts there I
[18:01] think time is
[18:02] certainly the greatest tool for adoption
[18:05] in terms of it's just going to take time
[18:07] like it just like the internet was
[18:10] around in the early 90s and many people
[18:11] weren't aware about it and still even 15
[18:14] years later 2005 2006 it's around but it
[18:18] compared to today it looks completely
[18:21] Antiquated so it'll take time and that's
[18:24] when it comes back to price being the
[18:26] ultimate signal we talk about Bitcoin
[18:29] reaching 100K which I view as
[18:31] inevitability within the next 12 months
[18:34] okay that's that's a signal and then
[18:36] you're talking about Bitcoin reaching
[18:38] you know 250k or so along with the
[18:41] increase in other asset prices to where
[18:43] Satoshi Nakamoto the ownership the owner
[18:46] of about 1.1 million Bitcoins then
[18:48] becomes the richest person in the world
[18:52] well that's pretty significant as
[18:54] well along with the continued Calamity
[18:57] of theat currencies and their
[19:00] governments let's
[19:02] say let's say Trump adopts Bitcoin as a
[19:07] treasury Reserve asset to any amount
[19:10] literally buys 10 Bitcoins with it well
[19:13] then you're talking about Game Theory
[19:15] other countries like El Salvador have
[19:16] already gotten there and they've reaped
[19:18] the benefits and are continuing to and
[19:21] then other countries will start to adopt
[19:23] so this is where you get that gradually
[19:25] then suddenly that really hockey stick
[19:28] moment
[19:30] and then a country starts printing their
[19:31] own money to buy do to buy Bitcoins and
[19:35] you're talking about things that can
[19:36] happen really fast and then it becomes a
[19:37] scramble but it's all theoretical and
[19:41] it's it's hard to know for sure how it
[19:43] plays out but ultimately people will end
[19:46] up fom moing in for better for worse and
[19:51] they don't want to miss out and and then
[19:52] it'll continue it'll eventually just run
[19:55] away and because viat is a runaway train
[19:57] that's about getting stopped anytime
[20:00] soon as is
[20:02] Bitcoin they're going to crash into each
[20:04] other and because one of those runaway
[20:07] trains is infinitely devalued and one of
[20:11] them is infinitely more valued over
[20:15] time then the one that's more valued
[20:17] over time is just going to logically win
[20:20] and that's the train that's going to
[20:22] continue to run and people are going to
[20:23] hop on and some people won't and they'll
[20:25] go to gold and whatever you know people
[20:27] will face the consequences of their
[20:29] Market decisions as is the case with
[20:32] economies for centuries and thousands of
[20:35] years but it's not going to happen
[20:36] overnight as we've talked about and it's
[20:38] not going to reach 100% even in the next
[20:41] 30 Years it'll take long yeah it's
[20:43] interesting I also think that the major
[20:47] adoption if we want it or not will
[20:50] come because big institutional people
[20:53] and countries will come in and then priz
[20:56] will rise and then all of the sudden the
[20:59] guys is like oh [ __ ] it's 100,000
[21:01] 200,000 now I have to get in uh and I
[21:05] had like Rog son on and he said
[21:07] something really interesting that's
[21:08] still still then stuck in my head he
[21:11] said like um even if we had one million
[21:14] US dollar per coin 90% of Bitcoin 90% of
[21:18] people will still not adopt a Bitcoin
[21:20] 90% of people will still be in in a feat
[21:23] world because they will still say the
[21:25] same [ __ ] they are saying since like one
[21:27] year or uh and and uh it's like yeah I I
[21:31] believe that like I like what's the
[21:34] price point when start like wondering
[21:37] themselves oh maybe I'm wrong
[21:40] yeah what is definitely true is that
[21:42] across each market cycle with Bitcoin
[21:44] each having cycle so every four years
[21:47] you get more and more people that become
[21:50] hardcore bitcoiners I.E I'm a single
[21:52] issue voter all my savings are
[21:54] denominated in Bitcoin and I would only
[21:57] vote for any for somebody that appeals
[22:00] to my
[22:01] beliefs so as price continues to rise as
[22:04] as the world discovers the first
[22:07] digitally verifiable
[22:09] immutable scarce asset immutably scarce
[22:13] asset then you're going to continue to
[22:15] see people jump on board and adopt those
[22:19] beliefs of okay I want money separated
[22:21] from State I want all of my payments to
[22:26] be in Bitcoin I want to receive my salar
[22:28] bcoin there's a growing number of those
[22:31] people and as they become louder and
[22:33] louder and louder then the effect they
[22:36] have is greater and greater and greater
[22:38] especially in the political space and
[22:40] that's the one that for better for worse
[22:42] rules over us right now so it's slowly
[22:46] making its way in it's slowly
[22:48] infiltrating as I as we touched on it's
[22:51] already being discussed with
[22:53] presidential candidates in the United
[22:54] States with Trump he's speaking at
[22:56] Nashville in a few weeks and you're
[22:58] going to see senators and and
[23:02] congressmen and women continuing to run
[23:04] on platforms of high support bitcoiners
[23:07] and their beliefs and I support the use
[23:09] of Bitcoin in the states and maybe they
[23:11] don't necessarily understand it fully
[23:13] but you know over each cycle I think the
[23:16] the main point is that you're going to
[23:18] see more and more people become hardcore
[23:21] bitcoiners and really just bitcoiners in
[23:23] general that that see the Merit of
[23:26] Bitcoin and see the failures in short of
[23:29] Fiat and how their lives are literally
[23:32] being stolen from them because of the
[23:35] inflationary nature of the US dollar and
[23:37] all Fiat currencies and so as more and
[23:39] more people wake up the the adoption
[23:42] number increases and then you're you're
[23:44] just talking about a technology getting
[23:47] adopted that's really cool um do you
[23:49] think um uh last one on this topic uh
[23:53] because it's really interesting for me
[23:54] when I think about right now there's
[23:56] like different kinds of bitcoiners there
[23:58] those who only care about the numberr
[24:00] technology speaking those are on
[24:03] exchanges on ETFs on on those kind of
[24:06] things which is the the vast majority of
[24:09] people like the vast majority of
[24:11] bitcoiners don't have a hardare wallet I
[24:15] talked with the treasure CEO he said
[24:16] like 2% roughly of Bitcoin holders have
[24:21] a hard wallet themselves do you think
[24:23] that uh like that that the whole world
[24:27] will benefit from Bitcoin or is it only
[24:30] those people who actually get Bitcoin
[24:32] and the properties of Bitcoin and what
[24:34] Bitcoin will actually do for for you
[24:37] personally I think absolutely the whole
[24:39] world benefits from it even if you don't
[24:41] hold it money being separated from state
[24:44] in that you don't have a central Banker
[24:47] or a politician or a government able to
[24:51] obliterate your life savings at the
[24:53] stroke of a pen I mean that's huge for
[24:56] yourself even if you don't own the thing
[24:59] of course what would you own in that
[25:00] sense if you want to participate in
[25:02] economy where money is separated from
[25:04] State that's a whole another topic but I
[25:07] think I think all of humanity has to
[25:09] benefit from it because the main problem
[25:13] with money over time is its
[25:16] centralization in that people can
[25:17] control and manipulate it create it
[25:20] whatever whether it's R Stones whether
[25:23] it's Agri beads in Africa there's plenty
[25:24] of stories that we could go through but
[25:28] the the core value with Bitcoin is that
[25:30] no one is able to manipulate it no one's
[25:32] able to create it no one's able to
[25:34] debase your life savings that you've
[25:36] rightfully earned and no one can take it
[25:39] from you can't be censored it's
[25:42] permissionless and that you don't need
[25:43] to go to a government or a bank to sign
[25:46] off on you joining the network you can
[25:48] just go and pay somebody and so it helps
[25:51] everybody
[25:53] again if of course it helps you more if
[25:55] you own if you own the thing and you
[25:57] participate logically it's like how much
[26:00] does an iPhone do for you if you don't
[26:01] own an iPhone but I think it still
[26:04] benefits people because it separates
[26:06] money from State perfect really cool I
[26:09] love that f a lot that it will benefit
[26:11] like even the last person that comes in
[26:13] and even the last person that kind of is
[26:14] on that like it benefits from from the
[26:17] social thing and from everything uh and
[26:20] from the monetary aspect I was actually
[26:22] your your journey into Bitcoin how did
[26:24] you came in and and what are you
[26:25] currently doing in Bitcoin yeah my
[26:29] journey is from the investing realm I
[26:33] got into equities in the stock market in
[26:35] August
[26:36] 20120 shortly after they printed
[26:39] trillions of dollars so it was quite
[26:41] lucrative and the ultimate case of
[26:43] beginner's luck and then I rode that way
[26:46] for about five or six months until start
[26:50] of 2021 when I heard about crypto from a
[26:55] friend and I started looking into it and
[26:58] and really just sent some money into
[27:01] Bitcoin not really knowing what it was
[27:03] purely for the number to go up
[27:05] technology and I held it for two weeks
[27:08] and I was sweating my balls off the
[27:10] entire time because I had no idea what I
[27:13] was holding I was I just hoping it would
[27:14] go up so anytime I went down I would
[27:16] scare I I would get
[27:18] scared which is the case as these bull
[27:21] markets happen which leads to volatility
[27:23] but that's another topic so I held that
[27:26] Bitcoin for two weeks I made a little
[27:27] bit of profit on it I bought it in at
[27:29] like 48,000 I think was the price for
[27:32] one Bitcoin and I sold when it was about
[27:35] 55,000 then I moved into an altcoin
[27:38] called Theta token and rode that way for
[27:41] a little bit Ro rode kind of the bull
[27:42] market and
[27:44] then I invested at the end of the year
[27:47] in a crypto def5 project called Olympus
[27:50] da
[27:51] 33 which was basically dog water so I I
[27:58] put my money in dog water and you know
[28:00] anybody that's drank dog water knows
[28:02] doesn't taste very good it's not good
[28:04] for your body so so I quickly lost some
[28:08] money and realized I was playing the
[28:10] whole investment game
[28:12] completely
[28:13] incorrectly not optimally so I reset
[28:16] went back to square one and just
[28:18] reevaluated my entire investment
[28:20] strategy sold everything in the market
[28:22] went straight to cash and just started
[28:25] looking and analyzing at all the
[28:27] different Mone monetary investment asset
[28:29] and investment assets out there stocks
[28:32] bonds
[28:34] artwork
[28:35] cars gold crypto Bitcoin and I came
[28:40] across this guy's model on Twitter his
[28:43] account is defiore initiate and he
[28:46] posted this model built around the
[28:48] having
[28:49] cycle and that's really what put me on
[28:52] to bitcoin and started that's really
[28:54] what made me ask the first question
[28:56] about it and once you ask the first
[28:57] question question that's your first step
[29:00] and you you really never come back but
[29:01] my first question is why does
[29:04] Bitcoin appreciate in these fouryear
[29:06] intervals right after this whatever the
[29:09] having is 2013 bull market 2017 bll
[29:13] Market 2021 bull market okay why is that
[29:16] and then 2014 bare Market 2018 bare
[29:19] market and then it was February March
[29:21] 2022 and it already kind of drifted that
[29:24] way into 2022 being another bare Market
[29:27] was like shoot
[29:29] there might be something here so I
[29:30] continue to look more and more into it
[29:32] and and that kind of 2022 four-year
[29:35] habing cycled type of thesis continue to
[29:38] play out over the year and obviously it
[29:41] kind of reached the peak with FTX going
[29:43] under which is right around the time
[29:45] when I read the Bitcoin standard in the
[29:48] fall of that year and that was that was
[29:49] my orange pill moment where I realize
[29:52] what money was and the significance of
[29:55] Bitcoin as the hardest money in the
[29:59] universe and how it was basically a
[30:03] runaway train because of that hard money
[30:06] property and because of course it's
[30:08] secured as well through its
[30:10] decentralized
[30:11] nature among other things but then that
[30:15] led me to ask even more questions and I
[30:16] hopped on bitcoin Twitter and started
[30:18] following more and more people started
[30:20] reading more books listening to podcasts
[30:22] and I was so far down the rabbit hole
[30:24] even a year and a half ago and I'm
[30:26] infinitely further down it
[30:28] now but that's kind of how I got into it
[30:30] was realizing this is the best place to
[30:33] put my money period but now you also um
[30:36] working in Bitcoin or doing something in
[30:38] Bitcoin yeah right the second part of
[30:39] your question yes so I'm on bitcoin
[30:41] Twitter and writing and I have a
[30:44] newsletter and produce some content on
[30:46] there and then I'm writing a book as
[30:48] well called the Bitcoin thesis about 60%
[30:52] done and that's it's almost a book for
[30:55] myself in the sense of I wish this is
[30:58] the book that I had right when I got
[31:00] into investing when I was 18 or even
[31:03] anybody that's first getting
[31:06] into the question of what is bitcoin
[31:09] this is the book that I would want them
[31:11] to have this is the book that I would
[31:12] want to have that at that
[31:15] point and it's also a great way to teach
[31:18] as well great way to learn sorry because
[31:20] the best way to learn is to teach so
[31:23] writing is a great way to encode
[31:24] information into your brain and so doing
[31:27] this research paper thesis book process
[31:31] has helped me learn immensely about
[31:34] Bitcoin and Fiat pre-market economics
[31:37] etc etc and even you know the book gets
[31:40] into some things like the rise of Hitler
[31:42] and how that's actually connected to
[31:44] Central Banking and the
[31:46] removal of the gold standard and how
[31:49] that had a trickle down effect which led
[31:51] to again Hitler Rising the power which
[31:54] really isn't discussed all that often
[31:56] and it's quite significant if that is
[31:57] true
[31:58] that it stems from monetary issue that's
[32:01] still in place
[32:02] today uh but yeah and then I am running
[32:06] an investment fund right now as well
[32:07] that's built around Bitcoin of course
[32:11] and yeah it's been a lot of fun thank
[32:12] you you already made it halfway through
[32:14] the video and I'm really really grateful
[32:17] to have you here two things make this
[32:19] channel possible you as a watcher and
[32:21] listener who keep supporting this
[32:23] Channel and another one is all the
[32:25] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[32:28] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[32:30] very start and where I personally buy my
[32:32] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[32:34] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[32:36] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[32:40] simplest and securest way to secure your
[32:43] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[32:45] only 2% of bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin
[32:48] in a hardware wallet how crazy is that
[32:50] don't be in that 98% bracket be in the
[32:54] 2% bracket and if you have self- custody
[32:56] and you know your friend does not not
[32:58] have maybe he needs a Christmas present
[32:59] maybe he needs a birthday present and a
[33:01] small life Heck if you use code Robin
[33:04] you get 5% off your order plus you
[33:07] support my channel and now let's get
[33:09] back to the video really cool I I love
[33:11] the um I'm I'm myself like I'm I'm
[33:15] writing art uh I'm writing articles for
[33:17] me and I might turn it into book I don't
[33:20] know if if if if there's enough coming
[33:22] because I kind of want to get all the
[33:25] thoughts that I get from the podcast and
[33:28] like just clean it out from myself
[33:30] because I get asked when I'm a guest on
[33:32] a podcast like oh what are your favorite
[33:34] takeaways from a podcast and stuff like
[33:36] that and I have like 20,000 answers in
[33:38] my head and I canot figure out what's
[33:40] the best one and that's why I kind of
[33:43] just like want to clean my head and then
[33:44] want to research like what has been said
[33:46] on the podcast and order it everything
[33:48] so I think writing is is amazing for
[33:50] your own brain and for your own thoughts
[33:53] um what did you learn about Bitcoin
[33:54] while while writing the
[33:56] book yeah I mean that's that's a huge
[33:58] question but it's hard to pinpoint one
[34:00] thing again there's 20,000 different
[34:02] answers that can pop up of course but I
[34:05] think just writing about it for me I
[34:09] felt it basically poured out of me in
[34:12] the sense that I was filled up so
[34:15] positively with Bitcoin and what it
[34:16] could do and I had so many questions
[34:18] about it and so many things that I
[34:20] wanted to learn about it that I couldn't
[34:21] just keep it within myself and I had to
[34:23] actually express it in some
[34:25] capacity and the book writing and me
[34:27] going on Twitter coincidental and
[34:29] timing and it's a great way just to
[34:32] explore and you kind of answer the
[34:34] questions for yourself and I find that's
[34:35] a great way to write is to write so that
[34:39] you understand it yourself and you're
[34:41] kind of writing for the audience of one
[34:43] which is yourself and when you
[34:45] understand it then you're you're
[34:46] teaching yourself and that's a great way
[34:48] to do that what's one thing that I've
[34:50] learned from Bitcoin I learned about the
[34:52] IMF in in the World Bank for the first
[34:54] time and how just Savage disgusting
[34:59] those organizations are and the global
[35:03] extraction process that they perform to
[35:06] the global South and and all the
[35:10] disgusting effects that stem from that
[35:12] that was something that really open my
[35:13] eyes especially the work of Alex
[35:15] gladstein he's just fantastic on the
[35:17] subject and it was something that I
[35:19] heard a little bit about on bitcoin
[35:21] Twitter but never
[35:22] really Dove too deep into and once I did
[35:26] it was
[35:28] it's about as sickening as anything I've
[35:30] ever looked into so I just gotta forgot
[35:33] my phone to turn off no
[35:36] worries uh that's an interesting topic
[35:38] and uh for me it's also like um we we
[35:43] talk in Bitcoin of not like so much
[35:45] about the future like I had a podcast
[35:47] episode where we talked about how we
[35:49] mine a Mercury and and use use like the
[35:52] this sun's energy to you really get
[35:55] Bitcoin mining going and and get Bitcoin
[35:59] across space and stuff like that but I'm
[36:01] then I'm like we have a lot of problems
[36:03] on earth like let's let's let's clean up
[36:05] first here uh before we think about
[36:08] going to to to other planets just
[36:10] quickly on on that uh topic on that uh
[36:13] and that uh IMF topic what is the for
[36:17] people that don't know about it who did
[36:19] not research about it um what is a good
[36:22] way to get in this topic uh and why
[36:26] should we talk about
[36:28] can you hear that by the way in the
[36:30] background yeah but it's
[36:32] uh is it a phone yeah there's there's a
[36:35] landline at the property I'm at right
[36:37] now which is Ian it's like finding a
[36:39] dinosaur but oh it's nice landline
[36:42] because we talked before about that
[36:44] landline cell phone it's still there
[36:46] like it's also in austa like landlines
[36:49] are are still a thing in Austria um but
[36:53] less and less for example I in my
[36:55] apartment not no landline but I my
[36:58] grandma still has a landline I don't
[37:00] know if it's still available uh and
[37:03] there are even some new houses they just
[37:05] wanted to have a landline because it
[37:06] wasable there and they they just put it
[37:08] in it's like a house form that's always
[37:11] reachable um exactly yeah it's it's
[37:14] something interesting but I think like
[37:18] now it's like
[37:19] 0.01% or something like that it's still
[37:22] there and it it it will be extinct at
[37:25] some point probably yeah I think I like
[37:28] I said it's already becoming more and
[37:30] more Antiquated and even being here I've
[37:33] never picked up the phone once but it is
[37:36] it is quite interes it's a full circle
[37:37] moment as we talked about at the start
[37:39] but to answer your question about the
[37:41] IMF I would say if you really want to
[37:44] research it look into the work of Alex
[37:47] gladin and he has a couple of great
[37:49] articles on bitcoin mag magazine as well
[37:51] as a book at least one book that he's
[37:53] written dive deep there or wait for the
[37:57] book to be published uh but other than
[38:00] that I am going to be posting some
[38:02] content soon about it on Twitter as well
[38:06] because the world needs to understand
[38:08] what's going on there because right now
[38:11] there I think the majority of people
[38:12] view these organizations AS Global Aid
[38:16] and what Richard Nickerson said is let
[38:18] us remind ourselves that the purpose of
[38:20] Aid is not to help others but to help
[38:22] ourselves of course Richard Nixon was
[38:24] the US president that changed the brenon
[38:28] Woods gold standard to the full-fledged
[38:30] Fiat standard the one that formed the
[38:32] monetary system that we have today and
[38:35] he was the one that said the GU part out
[38:37] loud and that these global economic aid
[38:40] organizations are not helping others
[38:42] they're really extracting resources from
[38:44] these other
[38:46] countries and bringing it to the
[38:47] developed Nation developed Nations and
[38:49] so what's happening
[38:51] is the developing countries are actually
[38:54] developing the developed countries not
[38:57] the other way oh man that's that's some
[38:59] some some deep TRS right
[39:02] there I think it would completely um
[39:06] flipped out like four years ago when I
[39:07] would have heard that uh but now I'm
[39:09] like yeah it makes to total sense like
[39:12] it's even if you look at like history of
[39:14] money like um there was this time where
[39:17] like Europeans already figured out and
[39:19] they were already kind of on a gold
[39:20] standard uh the Africans not and then
[39:23] when you have not the global Reserve
[39:25] currency when you don't have the the
[39:27] best monetary
[39:28] standard your value will be extracted
[39:32] and especially with the us right now
[39:34] it's like 66 countries or something like
[39:36] that outside of the US half the us as as
[39:40] currency and it's it's a massive good
[39:43] business model they can print money of
[39:45] course they also have inflation in their
[39:46] own country but they can export the
[39:48] inflation uh and and Export it in other
[39:51] contest that's like uh it it's it almost
[39:55] seems unreal when you really think about
[39:57] what's going on with Fe and then you
[39:59] think about like how many people judge
[40:01] Bitcoin as like a pyramid scheme or like
[40:03] a some something weird and then you're
[40:06] like no but everything else is kind of a
[40:09] pyramid scheme is kind of like this this
[40:12] yeah and the further and further you get
[40:14] down into it the more obvious it becomes
[40:17] it's just that most people don't even
[40:19] bother asking the questions or looking
[40:21] further into it past what they hear from
[40:24] often times mainstream media and so
[40:28] you know a quotee that I like is forget
[40:31] what they tell you if you want the truth
[40:33] follow the money because that that's
[40:34] where the truth lies and if you follow
[40:36] the money in the IMF you'll see that
[40:38] these countries for every dollar of
[40:40] quote unquote Aid that goes into
[40:42] countries on average $14 comes out of
[40:46] those countries and so they're just
[40:48] getting they're just getting their
[40:49] resources extracted from them no
[40:51] different than when West Africans had
[40:54] their resources extracted from them in
[40:56] the and 16th century with European
[40:59] settlers coming in and printing Agri
[41:01] beads and enslaving them because they
[41:03] had all the power the monetary power and
[41:06] that is that is the greatest power for
[41:07] better for worse is monetary power
[41:10] because that's what underpins Society
[41:13] our economy and so when you have the
[41:16] ability to print money at will and
[41:19] thrust it upon people and enslave them
[41:21] with debt which is what I get into the
[41:23] book and what Alex Glon does a really
[41:25] good job of covering then become
[41:28] enslaved and then they have to abide by
[41:30] your terms your standards and so what
[41:32] often come what often happens is the IMF
[41:35] will give terms to one of these
[41:38] countries and you'll start to see
[41:39] multinational corporations from
[41:41] developed countries come in and they'll
[41:43] start building roads but what would
[41:45] those roads lead to they'll lead to
[41:47] mines for scarce
[41:49] resources Platinum copper whatever it is
[41:53] and they'll go in and extract those
[41:55] resources and then they'll send them out
[41:57] to the developed countries at lower cost
[42:00] because they debased the currency in the
[42:02] process by enslaving them with debt that
[42:04] they have to pay back with more money
[42:06] it's a whole it's a really sick cycle is
[42:09] what it is do you think that um coming
[42:13] coming back to to this social aspect and
[42:17] this fairness This Global fairness that
[42:20] which is not there yet is not there now
[42:24] um do you think this will be the most
[42:26] impact
[42:27] impactful thing that Bitcoin will bring
[42:30] as a change to uh the world as because
[42:34] when you have like actual Global money
[42:36] with with Bitcoin nobody can manipulate
[42:38] it of course there are people that have
[42:40] more Bitcoin there are bigger countries
[42:42] there are small counters and all that
[42:44] things but um will this will this be the
[42:48] biggest change that Bitcoin will bring
[42:50] besides the monetary aspect this being
[42:54] the what what specifically do you mean I
[42:57] mean the when we talk about the IMF and
[42:59] extracting other countries and basically
[43:01] enslaving them when we when you get $1
[43:04] in and 14 out uh that's kind of like
[43:07] enslavement for me um and will Bitcoin
[43:10] stop this and will this be the the most
[43:12] impactful thing on a on a global scale
[43:15] not just like getting good money yeah I
[43:18] think that when I discussed the IMF and
[43:21] the World Bank in the book is in a
[43:23] chapter called why Bitcoin matters and
[43:26] why Bitcoin matters in one word is
[43:28] freedom and when you are enslaved by a
[43:32] central bank or a government as all US
[43:34] citizens are that hold US dollars for
[43:35] met Force much less people out in West
[43:38] Africa or Bangladesh that are bow into
[43:41] the structural adjustment terms of the
[43:44] IMF and the World Bank the fact is that
[43:46] anybody that owns money and earns money
[43:48] and has to pay taxes in money that can
[43:51] be manipulated and debased at will by a
[43:54] select group of Elites you are
[43:58] you are enslaved by those people because
[44:00] they control your life savings as they
[44:03] please you have no say in the matter
[44:05] it's not
[44:06] Democratic and so it's not just the IMF
[44:09] people or the IMF developing countries
[44:12] that are enslaving even though it's much
[44:14] worse in those cases it's everyone
[44:17] that's under Central Banking and Fiat
[44:20] currencies that hold money earn money
[44:25] and pay taxes in money that can be
[44:27] debased to Oblivion just because the
[44:30] central bank will says oh that's that's
[44:32] what we should do we'll print $6
[44:34] trillion doll in
[44:35] stimulus because we feel like it and
[44:37] there's no there's
[44:39] no Democratic vote across the country
[44:41] and so
[44:43] what what Bitcoin does is it breaks the
[44:48] chain between central banks and citizens
[44:52] and it free citizens as a result because
[44:55] with Bitcoin nobody can control the
[44:58] system nobody can manipulate it nobody
[44:59] can create new Bitcoins at will there's
[45:01] not a select Corporation or government
[45:04] or group of Elites Bankers politicians
[45:06] whatever it is that can control the
[45:08] system and that's the entire idea with
[45:11] Bitcoin and that's the entire problem
[45:14] with money over the course of humanity
[45:17] is it's control by centralized powers
[45:19] and that's why it's so
[45:21] significant and that's why Bitcoin frees
[45:23] the world and that's why Bitcoin matters
[45:25] because it frees the world because it
[45:28] solves the problem of centralization so
[45:30] now we have a decentralized money that
[45:31] nobody can use it can be sent in
[45:34] instantly anywhere in the world it can
[45:35] be divided down smaller than a penny and
[45:38] it can never be inflated past 21
[45:40] Millions which mean 21 million Bitcoins
[45:42] which means your value can never be
[45:44] debased which is what happens when
[45:46] monetary currencies are inflated your
[45:49] money gets devalued as a result so now
[45:52] you're talking about a monetary standard
[45:55] that can be used across the globe
[45:56] everywhere that everyone can unite on
[45:58] that everyone can adopt as a standard
[46:00] measurement of value and that okay a cow
[46:03] is worth or let's say a pound of beef is
[46:05] worth half a Bitcoin in the United
[46:07] States and it's worth a quarter of the
[46:08] Bitcoin in Australia well then what you
[46:11] would see happen is by the nature of the
[46:13] free market because cow producers can
[46:15] earn more for their beef in the United
[46:18] States they ship more beef out there and
[46:21] because Supply would increase there then
[46:24] the demand to supply Rel relationship
[46:27] would fall and the price would fall as a
[46:28] result and so you'd reach this kind of
[46:31] collective Global equilibrium to where
[46:33] price would fall there and then you're
[46:36] talking about the free market being
[46:37] Unleashed because
[46:39] we're because we're United on free money
[46:43] we're United on a standard measurement
[46:45] of value that can never be manipulated
[46:47] and that can be understood anywhere in
[46:48] the world on a global digital immutable
[46:51] level and that's protected from any
[46:54] manipulation or centralized evil
[46:56] authorities
[46:58] I love that a lot I had one thought in
[47:00] my mind when you were speaking um do you
[47:03] think it's a
[47:04] possibility short and medium term maybe
[47:07] even long term that central banks figure
[47:10] out that they need Bitcoin as Black Rock
[47:13] figured out that they need Bitcoin As
[47:15] Trump figured out that he needs Bitcoin
[47:18] that they are just starting to buy them
[47:20] and and try to back feeld currencies to
[47:24] a certain amount with Bitcoin and
[47:26] therefore kind of safe feed currencies
[47:30] right I think that that thought goes
[47:31] through my mind a good bit and it's
[47:33] certainly a possibility in the infinite
[47:35] range of
[47:36] outcomes I think like what's the point
[47:41] of doing that though is AR they're going
[47:44] to save Fiat so that they can still then
[47:47] manipulate the US dollar because that's
[47:49] the
[47:50] only point of having the US dollar for
[47:53] central banks is because they can
[47:54] manipulate it and change interest rates
[47:56] and try try to affect the economy which
[47:58] enriches those at the top well if you
[48:00] back it by a certain amount of Bitcoin
[48:03] well then you can't do what Central
[48:05] Banking is designed to do so then you're
[48:08] completely eradicated the point of
[48:09] Bitcoin unless then you change the the
[48:13] fixed exchange rate which then you're
[48:15] just manipulating currency and we're
[48:17] back at the same problem again which
[48:19] would then say well let's just get rid
[48:22] of f currencies Al together which is
[48:24] what we're doing right now so there's
[48:26] doesn't it's kind of antithetical to
[48:28] adopt for a central bank to adopt
[48:31] Bitcoin and you could have it in your
[48:33] reserves but then are you still able to
[48:34] manipulate money that's backing it and
[48:37] again it goes back to what I just talked
[48:38] about you either can have a fixed
[48:40] exchange rate which then there's no need
[48:41] for a central bank or you have a
[48:43] non-fixed exchange rate which means we
[48:45] should get rid of the central bank
[48:47] because they can manipulate money so
[48:49] that's that's how I like to think of it
[48:51] I think that's uh the simplest Solutions
[48:54] and the the simplest explanation of that
[48:56] that I ever heard really cool I loved
[48:58] how you how you put it um before we get
[49:00] to the end and before we uh come to the
[49:02] closer end to the podcast um how do you
[49:05] see a AI coming into this thing like AI
[49:10] impacting or maybe even integrating with
[49:13] with Bitcoin it's like for me like when
[49:15] when when AI with all the information
[49:17] out there which which money will it
[49:19] choose for me it's pretty obvious like
[49:21] how do you see that whole thing with AI
[49:23] and and Bitcoin the integration and the
[49:25] impacting
[49:27] yeah I'm certainly not the most
[49:29] technical computer programmer person so
[49:31] I I probably wouldn't be the best person
[49:34] on this subject but I think AI much as
[49:39] I'm sure you've come to the conclusion
[49:40] would choose Bitcoin because it's
[49:43] permissionless right they don't have to
[49:44] go to a bank to sign up to use it it's
[49:46] instantly sendable and it's verifiable
[49:50] so you know when an AI pays an AI we can
[49:52] see it we can understand that Bitcoins
[49:54] have been sent from one place to another
[49:57] from one address to another and you
[49:58] don't need to be an actual person to
[50:01] have an address you can be in quote
[50:03] unquote AI you can be a form of
[50:04] artificial intelligence that just
[50:06] communicates with each other and I think
[50:08] that really starts diving into the the
[50:12] futuristic Brilliance of Bitcoin and
[50:14] we're kind of just really getting to the
[50:17] edge of that
[50:19] water interesting um before we start to
[50:23] the end um I have one question that
[50:26] always asked my my guest uh before the
[50:28] end to the the aim of the question is
[50:31] like kind of getting something else
[50:33] outside of Bitcoin outside of money and
[50:36] outside of those topics in um so what
[50:39] can we learn from you besides
[50:41] Bitcoin yeah great great
[50:44] question something I very much plan on
[50:48] talking about on Twitter especially is
[50:50] this movement
[50:52] system that I often say and do say and
[50:55] would say and will say say that is the
[50:58] only thing that I would put in the same
[51:00] tier as Bitcoin in terms of Priceless
[51:03] information that I've learn and to put
[51:05] anything in that tier with Bitcoin is
[51:08] astronomically significant for me and so
[51:12] what I what I've learned and it was
[51:14] about two years ago now is this mve
[51:16] movement system called Goa and it's
[51:20] spell go a
[51:22] TA they don't do a great job of
[51:24] advertising or marketing it online
[51:27] and and uh there's some things down the
[51:29] line that I have visions about but
[51:32] essentially there's a movement pattern
[51:34] of injury and there's a movement pattern
[51:38] of security and durability so these
[51:41] people at Goa they looked at four
[51:44] different tribes of humans and analyzed
[51:48] them they looked at newborn babies
[51:51] straight out of the womb they looked at
[51:54] multi-decade athletes with little to no
[51:56] injuries they Tom Brady's or Michael
[51:59] Jordan's Ed
[52:01] Reeds then they looked at
[52:04] untouched indigenous tribes all across
[52:08] the world that have been basically
[52:09] unaffected by modern society and the
[52:11] lifestyles that come with that and then
[52:13] they looked at basically Centennial
[52:16] athletes like your Ida keing hurricane
[52:18] Hawkins that are for example Ida killan
[52:22] is 105y old track athlete and she's
[52:24] still running painf free and she loves
[52:27] every minute so they looked into all of
[52:29] these groups of people and they started
[52:31] asking questions well why what
[52:33] commonalities do they have and so they
[52:36] found there's actually a pattern of
[52:38] movement that actually aligns with
[52:41] nature because if you look at all forms
[52:43] of natural energetic movement think of a
[52:47] hurricane think of a tornado think of
[52:50] sacred geometry think of a galaxy like
[52:53] the Milky Way they all come in what they
[52:54] all spiral they all have these spirals
[52:57] to them so they move around this Center
[52:59] force and they spiral around them and
[53:01] they found that all four of these groups
[53:04] had those same spiral like patterns and
[53:07] it's really difficult to talk about over
[53:08] a podcast visuals is really the best way
[53:10] to describe it but then they looked at
[53:13] the other side and they said okay what's
[53:15] going on when we tear an ACL what goes
[53:18] on when we rupture an aili why is
[53:21] plantar fastis a thing why do we have
[53:24] low back pain and so they then they
[53:26] started getting further into the weeds
[53:28] and they found there are patterns in
[53:29] movement there as well where every
[53:32] single non-c cont ACL shred happens
[53:35] because the foot collapses and the arch
[53:38] that supports the foot collapses and
[53:41] then the pressure gets thrown up the
[53:43] chain into the knee and because you're
[53:45] you know very few people tear their asol
[53:47] when walking but happens a lot in
[53:50] football players with cuts right that's
[53:52] a lot of force being driven into the
[53:54] ground so when your arch collapses all
[53:57] that Force gets driven up into the knee
[53:58] and then your ACL takes the front of
[54:01] that Force as it's not designed to and
[54:03] then it tears but the idea there is that
[54:07] the our feet are our foundations for
[54:11] movement through time and space and
[54:13] specifically the arches in our feet
[54:16] arches in and of themselves are
[54:18] weightbearing structures right an arch
[54:20] you would never support an arch with
[54:23] another weight or another structure
[54:25] that's anti thetical to what an arch is
[54:28] but yeah we have arch support shoes
[54:31] right so anytime we collapse the arch
[54:35] which happens when our foot SPS out from
[54:38] that straight position think about it
[54:40] like two columns your feet and your
[54:43] knees your hips shoulders all the way up
[54:45] there are two columns on both sides of
[54:47] your body if your feet are straight
[54:50] those columns are in their position if
[54:52] you spay your feet out like a duck
[54:54] imagine the bottom of that column going
[54:56] outward and the other column going
[54:58] outward well then everything above that
[55:00] column would just collapse under it
[55:01] because there's nothing supporting it so
[55:03] when you playay your feet you're
[55:05] collapsing your arch and all of that
[55:07] weight gets thrown up to your lower back
[55:09] to your hip to your knee to your spine
[55:12] to your neck whatever it is and then
[55:14] those things that are not designed to
[55:16] absorb and load energy and force then
[55:19] they start atropine they start seeing
[55:22] chronic pain issues and so a longwind to
[55:26] answer but essentially they they
[55:29] advocate for straight feet and the
[55:31] strengthening of arches not
[55:34] using not using modern day shoes right
[55:38] barefoot shoes for me for example I had
[55:42] flat feet growing up and I started
[55:43] wearing barefoot shoes I retrained to
[55:47] become a go to mover and now I have
[55:50] arches in both of my feet which sounds
[55:53] it's almost backwards why would not
[55:55] having anything supporting my arches
[55:57] help me build an arch well it's because
[55:59] I'm actually strengthening the muscle
[56:01] and consistently developing it in the
[56:03] pattern as I was designed to move so
[56:05] what's significant with go is that they
[56:08] discover that every single human being
[56:09] and animal every single wild animal
[56:11] moves the same as every single newborn
[56:14] human they all have this same pattern of
[56:16] movement but we get codified into this
[56:19] woda
[56:21] realm through three things we get
[56:24] codified through the shoes that we wear
[56:26] that constrict our toe boxes support our
[56:28] arches heels raised backwards through
[56:32] the way that we sit in modern day chairs
[56:34] which it's almost like peeing in a
[56:37] urinal where your your pelvis and your
[56:40] hips get tucked forward and you sit in
[56:42] this front chain dominant which then
[56:45] pushes which externally rotates your
[56:47] hips which then what happens there is
[56:49] your femur gets externally rotated and
[56:50] then your hips and then your feet have
[56:52] display as a
[56:53] result and then you get Arch collapses
[56:56] in then the force comes right up the
[56:58] chain as well and then the third is the
[57:00] way that we train so anything that
[57:02] trains in that front chain dominant that
[57:04] pushes the hips forward and spays the
[57:06] feet out think of like a an Olympic
[57:08] squat or a deadlift with those feet
[57:11] splay their wide outside of the columns
[57:13] anytime you're outside of the columns
[57:15] you're driving force up the chain as it
[57:17] should not be
[57:19] so they found that all newborn human
[57:22] beings move Goa but we get woodified by
[57:26] modern lifestyle and so we have to
[57:28] retrain become Goa again to ReDiscover
[57:31] our true nature in line with how nature
[57:33] designed us to move how nature designed
[57:35] everything to move again if you look at
[57:37] wild animals like tigers lions dogs cats
[57:41] they all move in this go to pattern they
[57:42] all move the same way and that's how
[57:44] we're supposed to move as well and so
[57:46] when we move backward this is when well
[57:48] back pain becomes an issue This Is Why
[57:50] hip and knee Replacements are up 125 and
[57:53] 150% over the last 15 years it's because
[57:56] we're continuing adopt these modern ways
[57:58] of living that are backwards to how
[58:00] we're designed to move and exist through
[58:03] time and space and so we're suffering as
[58:07] a result so I'm glad you asked and
[58:09] there's much more to the go to thing and
[58:10] there's visuals that help explain but
[58:12] that's certainly something that I really
[58:14] feel called to share and express online
[58:17] and help people with and there's
[58:18] actually somebody right now that I'm
[58:20] helping to recode into becoming Goda and
[58:23] live and exist painfree because that's a
[58:26] birth right and being able to live and
[58:29] exist and move painfree is as Priceless
[58:32] as
[58:33] anything amazing how is it spelled again
[58:36] g o a t a oh amazing I will I will look
[58:41] it up maybe put some some resources in
[58:44] in in the description yeah uh maybe you
[58:46] can send me some some articles or books
[58:48] or something like that if if someone
[58:49] wants to check it out and and go deeper
[58:52] um this one's uh it's uh I had at a
[58:56] Twitter space with another bitcoiner um
[58:59] and he like just randomly had a story
[59:03] about Bitcoin and then he talked about
[59:06] on on an adventure in his thought train
[59:09] uh that he always runs without shoes
[59:12] like he just runs Barefoot all the time
[59:14] and I'm like how do you do like how do
[59:16] you do that and he's like how do you do
[59:18] it with shoes like they they are really
[59:21] bad for you and I'm like okay
[59:24] interesting and uh I I've seen more and
[59:26] more uh Bitcoin like Bitcoin um there's
[59:30] like small Bitcoin conferences like in a
[59:32] hotel with like 500 people uh I see
[59:36] there more and more people like they're
[59:37] just going outside with bare food or
[59:39] with just socks or something like that
[59:41] it's it's uh it's it's
[59:43] definitely a Bitcoin thing going back to
[59:46] to to the roots where and and and don't
[59:49] manipulate the the nature too much I
[59:51] mean that's that's what Bitcoin is all
[59:53] about like leaving nature as it is and
[59:56] don't in and don't manipulate things
[59:59] with the human hand yeah I like to say
[60:02] that Fiat is to bitcoin as WOD is to Goa
[60:07] and Bitcoin is Goa and Goa is Bitcoin
[60:10] they're abiding by the laws of nature
[60:11] the laws of physics the laws of energy
[60:13] and that's why they work and that's why
[60:16] there are
[60:17] solutions amazing perfect then let's

[60:38] meaning of life to be

[60:43] the meaning of life is to be alive right
[60:45] if you're not alive then you're dead and
[60:48] there is no life so there's there's many
[60:51] things that go into that right like what
