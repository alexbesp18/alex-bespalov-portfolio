[00:00] everyone was forced to bend the knee to
[00:01] the wheel and everybody will be forced
[00:03] to bend the KNE to bitcoin with the
[00:04] Bitcoin you are actually protecting your
[00:07] labor and they come knock on your door
[00:08] and they're like we're going to take
[00:10] this Bitcoin or we're going to you know
[00:12] arrest you and imprison you in the end
[00:13] they can only take it from you if you
[00:15] give it to them that's never existed
[00:16] before Bitcoin becomes the end all Beall
[00:19] money at some point if I can control
[00:21] your money then you always going to have
[00:23] to obey me and follow what I want but if
[00:26] I take away those shackles and give you
[00:28] the freedom to control your life and
[00:31] control your financial
[00:34] reward let's start with a small
[00:36] introduction of of a few guys I'm Trey
[00:39] um I came up small town South Carolina
[00:44] got into Bitcoin um after I entered the
[00:46] IT world in the civilian world I was in
[00:48] the Marine Corps for a little while but
[00:49] once I once I got in the civilian world
[00:51] I entered the it field and sometime
[00:54] around 2017 is I got interested in
[00:58] Bitcoin um I bought some and then sold
[01:01] it I made like 30 bucks I think I bought
[01:04] like $300 worth at the time had no idea
[01:06] what I was doing was buying I started
[01:08] buying other cryptos between 2017 and
[01:11] 2020 on and off like I had periods of
[01:14] time where I would buy a lot of crypto
[01:16] and then I wouldn't do anything for
[01:17] months and then I'd come back to it my
[01:19] interest kind of came and went but then
[01:21] sometime
[01:22] around 2020 2021 I had like my Bitcoin
[01:26] Epiphany moment and just went down the
[01:29] rabbit hole from there ended up uh
[01:32] working in crypto um not Bitcoin
[01:35] specifically for a while and learned a
[01:37] lot about crypto and kind of some of
[01:39] what that looks like realized that I
[01:41] didn't really like that and moved into
[01:43] Bitcoin specifically and we do a little
[01:45] Bitcoin mining uh we do we help people
[01:48] with like Bitcoin point of sale stuff uh
[01:50] from time to time and uh yeah that's
[01:54] me amazing and and before we get to to
[01:58] Tom um what made you understand Bitcoin
[02:00] like I'm always like interested it seems
[02:02] like that uh when you have Bitcoin and
[02:05] you have crypto and like first you get a
[02:07] little into it because n Go up
[02:08] technology then you get into the other
[02:10] cryptos and then you start slowly slowly
[02:13] to actually understand Bitcoin like what
[02:15] made you understand and then like what
[02:17] made you what made it click for
[02:21] you well at first the kind of the first
[02:25] inkling that I had that something was
[02:26] different about Bitcoin was when I read
[02:29] a Bitcoin I read a book called The bit
[02:31] the promise of Bitcoin or the Bitcoin
[02:32] promise I can't remember it was the
[02:34] first Bitcoin book I read and that one
[02:37] kind of laid the framework for why why
[02:40] Bitcoin was different and kind of how
[02:42] the author had seen different people
[02:43] come and go in Bitcoin and why they were
[02:45] always wrong how they should have always
[02:47] stayed they shouldn't have sold their
[02:48] Bitcoin they shouldn't have taken
[02:49] profits so on so forth and that one kind
[02:52] of opened the door but what really got
[02:53] me was when I started working in crypto
[02:55] and I saw behind the behind the scenes
[02:57] of crypto and what goes on not
[03:00] necessarily in like a negative light but
[03:02] just what goes on behind the doors and
[03:04] realistically I kind of classify all
[03:06] cryptocurrencies to include Bitcoin into
[03:09] one of three categories
[03:11] either it's it's a business trying to
[03:14] solve a problem that isn't money right
[03:16] it's not they might be trying to make
[03:18] money but they're not trying to solve
[03:19] the money problem so they're trying to
[03:20] solve a smaller problem that's driven
[03:22] towards profit one way or another
[03:23] everybody's in it just for the profit
[03:25] and eventually they'll take profits and
[03:27] go back to the dollar uh or it's a scam
[03:31] or it's Bitcoin and it's trying to solve
[03:34] the biggest problem therefore everything
[03:37] else is a business or a scam but Bitcoin
[03:39] is is completely separate and different
[03:41] it's it's actually just money and it's
[03:43] trying to solve a problem that it's very
[03:44] difficult to even see whereas everybody
[03:46] else is trying to solve something like a
[03:49] like a um like a business related
[03:51] Problem whatever that may be uh you know
[03:56] like an alternative currency because you
[03:59] think you have a better currency isn't a
[04:00] business problem but for the most part
[04:02] people are in that currency to make
[04:04] dollars not to replace currency or be
[04:06] something different so once I kind of
[04:08] figured that out it became bitcoin's
[04:12] important but how important what can it
[04:13] actually do and I just kind of fell down
[04:16] that rabbit hole and really when I
[04:17] really got orange pilled was when I was
[04:18] on a long drive one day and I read the
[04:20] Bitcoin standard or listened to the
[04:22] Bitcoin standard once that happened uh
[04:25] everything else was just like super fast
[04:28] like I I was almost completely converted
[04:31] um I I had this idea that one day I'd
[04:33] become like the the southern baptist
[04:36] Revival preacher of the South for
[04:37] Bitcoin we'd have like this great
[04:39] Bitcoin Revival but I couldn't figure
[04:41] out how to phrase it because it's not a
[04:42] Revival it's an introduction so I didn't
[04:44] want to be like oh we're going to do the
[04:45] great Bitcoin the Great Southern Bitcoin
[04:47] introduction you know it's like growing
[04:49] up in the South I'm used to like big
[04:50] preaching events and big big religious
[04:53] you know Gatherings from time to time in
[04:55] small towns and I kind of felt like
[04:57] Bitcoin was in the same category but you
[04:59] can't present it religiously but I kind
[05:01] of had that idea that one day I would
[05:04] I'd uh I'd run the south in
[05:06] Bitcoin that's uh that's interesting and
[05:09] and I see a lot the connection between
[05:11] religion and and Bitcoin it's it's
[05:13] fascinating for me but before we get
[05:14] into more topics uh Tom please uh
[05:17] introduce
[05:18] yourself yeah uh good afternoon um I'm a
[05:23] tax accounting prepare a tax return
[05:26] provide um monthly bookkeeping and
[05:28] payroll in fact that's how I met Trey uh
[05:31] he's a client of mine for tax
[05:33] preparation and I became attracted to
[05:36] bitcoin when Trey begin to explain to me
[05:39] the cost of the point of sales and of
[05:42] course with a lot of my small business
[05:43] clients they're dealing with the
[05:45] escalating credit card charges and the
[05:48] fees from uh the different credit cards
[05:50] or PayPal or what have you and so I
[05:53] became attracted to the to the whole
[05:55] process there that this will be a way
[05:57] for small business to to do business and
[06:01] to keep their cost down and also by the
[06:04] fact that Bitcoin is really true money
[06:08] uh of course as we all know that as it
[06:10] goes up your value goes up in in your
[06:14] account as opposed to when you look at
[06:16] when you put money in the bank um
[06:17] depending upon what's going on with
[06:19] inflation that $100 tomorrow could be
[06:21] $99 or it could be $95 whereas with
[06:25] Bitcoin that $100 the next day of course
[06:27] it could go the opposite way go down but
[06:30] right now of course it's going up that
[06:32] $100 could turn into $103 $110 so I saw
[06:37] Bitcoin as a means for small business to
[06:40] really to level the plan field and also
[06:43] to protect the value of the service that
[06:45] they
[06:47] provide and this is a big one like the
[06:49] the laying the BL uh uh leveling the
[06:52] blame field is like the the one of the
[06:54] biggest things in in in Bitcoin because
[06:56] it gives like a fair chance and fair
[06:57] rules to to everybody in the L that
[07:00] aspect so much um before we get more
[07:02] into Bitcoin like how did your podcast
[07:05] actually came together it's it's really
[07:06] interesting also the name Bitcoin is
[07:08] dead because we have like this website
[07:10] also probably aware of like how how many
[07:14] times Bitcoin is is is declared that in
[07:16] in the mainstream media how did this
[07:19] name come come together so I'm I'm glad
[07:22] you asked because I've been waiting on
[07:23] somebody to ask because I wanted to say
[07:25] this next phrase um so there's one time
[07:28] I was dressed up like George Washington
[07:30] behind a bowling alley and um what I was
[07:33] trying to do was there's a gun store
[07:35] nearby this bowling alley and we were
[07:37] hosting an event where we wanted to
[07:40] bring together the Second Amendment gun
[07:42] Community with the Bitcoin Community
[07:44] because I think there's a lot of there's
[07:45] a lot of overlap there
[07:47] uh our goal was to try to bring
[07:49] bitcoiners into the gun store and the
[07:51] gun store is also at the same time
[07:53] hosting their uh their grand opening so
[07:56] it was a combo effort for me to say hey
[07:59] like bitcoin's a thing you should pay
[08:01] attention to it and this gun store is
[08:03] accepting Bitcoin as well as just being
[08:06] pro Bitcoin overall right like they
[08:08] they're here we're here to preach each
[08:09] other's message together and so I
[08:12] dressed up like George Washington to uh
[08:14] attract the attention of passerbys so
[08:16] like if you're driving down the road and
[08:17] there's a guy dressed like George
[08:18] Washington you know with the hat and the
[08:19] shoes the coat the whole nine holding up
[08:22] various Bitcoin signs and things like
[08:24] that you might notice that and pay
[08:26] attention to it so leading up to this I
[08:29] would dress up in that same outfit and
[08:30] go into different towns and just walk
[08:32] into businesses and offer tell
[08:34] businesses like hey come see us on this
[08:36] day we'll help you understand what a
[08:38] Bitcoin point of sale is uh how it works
[08:40] and we're going to do some transactions
[08:42] you know live right there in front of
[08:43] everybody so you can see it and I walked
[08:46] into a coffee shop in a small town near
[08:47] me called Graham and there was a older
[08:50] gentleman at the cash register and I'm
[08:52] dressed up like George Washington so I
[08:53] look like a you know a pretty big maniac
[08:56] and I walk up to the lady behind the
[08:58] counter kind of explain what's going on
[08:59] she's interested and she's open and
[09:01] she's friendly and then the guy the
[09:03] older guy who was standing on the other
[09:04] side of the counter looks at me and says
[09:06] you know Bitcoin is dead they they they
[09:09] arrested that Sam bankman freed guy so
[09:12] the government's already canceled
[09:13] Bitcoin I don't know what you're doing
[09:15] and he's an older gentleman you know
[09:16] like he's probably in his 60s or 70s he
[09:18] didn't understand and I tried to explain
[09:20] to him and the only thing he really kept
[09:21] saying was a paraphrase of some some
[09:24] phrase like Bitcoin is dead and when it
[09:28] came time for me me and Tom we do a
[09:30] radio show every once in a while on the
[09:32] golden oldie station uh in my local town
[09:35] so it's a lot of times like I'll be
[09:37] talking about Bitcoin and somebody will
[09:38] call in uh because they want to like
[09:40] they want to try to sell off an antique
[09:42] furniture piece that they have or
[09:44] something like that like it's there's a
[09:45] very big disconnect between Bitcoin and
[09:47] the golden oldies Community when you
[09:49] talk about like people who listen to
[09:51] music from the 1940s 50s something like
[09:54] that um but it was my first it was the
[09:57] first place that allowed me to come and
[09:59] talk
[09:59] and so me and Tom have been doing that
[10:01] he does it for the tax doing the taxes
[10:04] when people have questions about the
[10:06] taxes and of course would they would
[10:07] change in tax laws and but I I keep
[10:10] running into this thing no matter where
[10:11] I speak because I spoke with a with um
[10:14] one of the Austrian groups here in my
[10:17] area like in the southern region I spoke
[10:19] with them twice and kind of the same
[10:20] thing I run into is either gold is
[10:22] better Bitcoin is dead or the
[10:23] government's going to shut it down and
[10:24] it will be dead and so I just decided
[10:26] that if everybody keeps telling me
[10:27] Bitcoin is dead that seems like a
[10:29] popular phrase I'll pick that up and so
[10:32] here we are it is a popular phrase and
[10:35] it's it it seems like I feel like most
[10:38] of it is just because uh the heavy up
[10:41] and downs because like once you get into
[10:44] Bitcoin or like once you see Bitcoin
[10:46] you're like oh what is this I don't
[10:47] believe it but government will shut it
[10:49] down then it goes up like crazy and
[10:51] you're like oh what's that then it goes
[10:53] down like crazy you're like okay it was
[10:54] just volatile it this de now then the
[10:57] second time it goes up then you're like
[10:59] okay okay let's let's investigate a
[11:00] little further then it goes down you're
[11:02] like okay it's actually now it's that
[11:05] and then it goes up again and you're
[11:06] like oh [ __ ] this this still is this
[11:08] thing is still alive uh so it's it's
[11:11] it's probably just because the like the
[11:13] the price is is is falling down but it's
[11:15] it's fascinating how much this phrase is
[11:17] still used uh even though this thing
[11:19] lives now for 15 years is getting
[11:22] stronger every year when you look at
[11:24] mining hashd when you look at other
[11:26] stuffs not just the price because the
[11:28] price is the least interesting thing in
[11:30] Bitcoin in my opinion but it's important
[11:33] to get new users in I'm aware of that
[11:36] but let's talk about that um uh
[11:38] mainstream and and and social media
[11:40] thing a little bit um do do you do you
[11:43] both still like uh read like newspapers
[11:46] and and and the let's let's call it
[11:48] traditional news versus uh the new news
[11:51] with like podcasting with Twitter with
[11:53] with other stuff are you still using
[11:55] like traditional media
[11:59] I do some I um when you made that
[12:03] comment out um it took me back a few
[12:05] years I used to work in a news stand
[12:08] back in the 80s when I was in college
[12:10] and um and of course uh love to read the
[12:13] different magazines in fact Sunday was
[12:15] my favorite day to work because you had
[12:17] the New York Times H The Washington Post
[12:19] you had the Atlanta Journal and of
[12:21] course here in North Carolina the
[12:22] Raleigh paper the Charlotte paper and I
[12:24] would try to read as many of those
[12:26] papers as I could in that 45 our shift
[12:30] there that I work um but over the last
[12:34] five to six years uh with availability
[12:37] of the internet on your telephone what
[12:39] have you um I can't remember the last
[12:42] time I read a newspaper uh because of
[12:45] course with the telephone makes
[12:47] everything so much more convenient there
[12:50] boom you just tap tap tap and then
[12:53] you've got whatever you want to read and
[12:56] I say that's more of a reflection of
[12:58] what's taking place um I got grandkids
[13:02] and they're anywhere from 16 to 7 so of
[13:06] course their whole world is on the
[13:07] telephone and that's the other thing
[13:09] that attracted me about the whole
[13:11] Bitcoin concept is very very convenient
[13:14] and of course older people are going to
[13:16] be somewhat more resistant I remember
[13:18] when you had the old dialup telephone
[13:20] years and years ago but of course now
[13:23] again going back to my grandkids they
[13:25] would know how to use a dialup telephone
[13:27] even though it has a dial on it they
[13:29] would be like what is this but you give
[13:31] them a cell phone and so of course
[13:33] that's the other thing again about the
[13:35] whole Bitcoin concept is it's so
[13:38] convenient it's there on your telephone
[13:40] and as we all know as long as the
[13:42] internet's there the Bitcoin is going to
[13:44] be there and of course everybody has
[13:45] their own
[13:46] prediction about the future of Bitcoin
[13:49] what's going to take place you know what
[13:51] future will it what will it role will it
[13:53] have in the future and the fact of it is
[13:55] as long as people have cell phone and
[13:57] have internet Bitcoin is going to be
[14:00] here D I'm really interested in uh
[14:04] because you have said you have grandkids
[14:05] you're probably then over 60 years old
[14:08] slightly
[14:11] 63 um and I'm amazed because like young
[14:15] people that are like 25 30 maybe like 35
[14:18] 40 around that uh that age they usually
[14:22] get the digital thing faster they get
[14:25] the digital thing quicker because they
[14:27] used it in like video games with skins
[14:30] like if you ask like a 15year old uh if
[14:32] something digital has value there of
[14:34] course because I I buy my skins of video
[14:36] games and stuff like that and what I
[14:38] often encounter is with with people like
[14:41] over 50 55 is like the the the the limit
[14:44] that I see um they often understand
[14:47] better why gold has value they often
[14:50] understand better the austan economics
[14:51] and the this kind of a thing better but
[14:54] they have the the digital uh digital um
[14:57] let's see digital hurdle to to get over
[15:01] um how do you how did you came over this
[15:03] and and was it also for you like the the
[15:05] AUST economics and and and gold value
[15:08] proposition was was faster there than
[15:11] the digital
[15:13] thing it was a combination of all of the
[15:16] above of course in the field I'm in in
[15:18] the world of accounting everything is
[15:21] done now by the internet everything is
[15:23] done digitally there uh I can remember
[15:26] um in the 80s when I first got into
[15:29] field of Taxation uh you had to do it
[15:31] with old paper you had to use the pencil
[15:33] and of course you had to have the carbon
[15:35] and so of course I've seen that whole
[15:37] Evolution going from doing it by hand to
[15:40] where now you you type it in and of
[15:43] course uh old habits di hard and a lot
[15:46] of it for me was Again by the fact that
[15:49] I'm in the world of technology I had to
[15:52] learn to adapt I remember having a
[15:53] conversation with someone at a tax
[15:55] agency uh back in the 90s and I think
[15:59] think I just got my email account and
[16:00] anyway I was telling her I said well I
[16:02] don't have my email account set up
[16:04] completely and she made the comment to
[16:05] me she said if you want to do business
[16:07] with us you got to have email so I begin
[16:10] to realize okay it's no longer to think
[16:13] that the internet's not going to survive
[16:15] no longer no need to think the email is
[16:17] not going to survive in fact I remember
[16:19] when the fax machine first came out and
[16:22] I can remember people saying oh it's not
[16:23] going to work oh it's not going to last
[16:25] you know blah blah blah blah blah blah
[16:27] you know here we are what 40 years later
[16:29] and the fact machine is still around not
[16:31] as much though of course with the
[16:34] technology and the email and the
[16:35] scanning so it made me really adapt to
[16:39] the technology and then I have of course
[16:42] having grandkids I got children and I
[16:44] just look uh especially at that 20ish
[16:47] there which is my daughter's age her
[16:49] life is on her cell phone everything
[16:51] there so I begin to realize okay if you
[16:54] want to stay in the game you need to
[16:57] change your strategy and learn to use
[16:59] the tools that are available and of
[17:01] course try's been a big asset to helping
[17:04] me with the whole internet and uh and
[17:06] again I guess you could say really
[17:08] giving me a higher level of confidence
[17:11] in taking away the fear I think fear
[17:13] holds people back when you talk about
[17:15] the internet and the email and what have
[17:17] you and of course once you overcome that
[17:19] fear you're like hey you know this is
[17:21] pretty
[17:22] convenient and it is for me imagine
[17:26] imagine if like talking about how like
[17:28] the internet Bitcoin or whatnot might
[17:30] die imagine you had like a 15-year-old
[17:32] kid and you introduced them for the
[17:33] first time to like your cousin you know
[17:35] or like to your uncle or somebody and
[17:37] you were like hey this is my son Tommy
[17:39] he's 15 and then your cousin was like
[17:41] well he might not make it to 16 I'm not
[17:43] going to put much effort into that kid
[17:44] he might die sometime soon like that's
[17:46] that's like what I hear when people tell
[17:47] me like bitcoin's going to die it's like
[17:49] at what point if it was 30 would you be
[17:51] like well it's getting close to middle
[17:52] age I reckon it might be around like no
[17:55] like this is a thing that's going to
[17:57] exist because we know how to create it
[17:59] if you if you outlawed V8 engines V8
[18:01] engines wouldn't go away because people
[18:03] still know how to use and make them you
[18:05] just wouldn't be able to necessarily buy
[18:07] new ones but the the concept that we
[18:09] know how to make them we know how
[18:10] engines work we it don't that that idea
[18:13] doesn't die and that's the same thing
[18:14] with Bitcoin like you can kill it in a
[18:15] region you can stop your citizenry from
[18:18] using it you can do all kinds of things
[18:20] to your people but you can't actually
[18:22] stop the Bitcoin process itself unless
[18:24] you can collectively control most of the
[18:27] world's resources either through energy
[18:28] your internet so I mean like it's it's a
[18:31] very difficult thing to kill so I don't
[18:32] really understand people perspective on
[18:34] that a lot it it i a lot of it is fear
[18:37] yeah I mean I think it's a I think it's
[18:39] fear and then also then once you accept
[18:43] that Bitcoin is going to be here then
[18:45] you also got to realize okay even though
[18:48] I've been programmed to believe and
[18:50] think of gold silver diamonds what have
[18:53] you US dollar Mexican peso what have you
[18:56] at the British pound then you have to
[18:58] change way you look at money and that's
[19:00] the other thing that Bitcoin has made me
[19:02] do it's made me change the way I look at
[19:04] money and also do a lot more research
[19:06] because once you begin to research you
[19:08] begin to realize wait a minute the US
[19:10] dollar is basically almost worthless now
[19:13] it's gone from the value that it had
[19:15] 1913 1914 what have you um maybe one or
[19:20] two cents now so that clearly tells you
[19:23] and explain to you what happens when you
[19:26] have um corrupt players in the game to
[19:30] what they would do to currency and if
[19:32] you look at the history of currency you
[19:35] begin to realize well you always got
[19:37] somebody behind the scene like in The
[19:39] Wizard Of ozs The Man Behind the
[19:41] curtains you always got somebody that is
[19:43] doing something to manipulate the value
[19:45] their currency not for the everyday
[19:48] working people but for their own selfish
[19:52] gains I I love it so much uh what you
[19:55] just said because um especially what
[19:58] what Trey also said with the idea even
[20:00] if Bitcoin the the vehicle dies off at
[20:03] some point maybe like there's a bug
[20:05] maybe there's some black SW that we
[20:06] don't know about I put it at 000000
[20:10] .1 uh possibilities but uh still if it
[20:15] happens the idea of sound money the idea
[20:17] of digital scarcity is still there and
[20:20] this is something where like more and
[20:22] more people uh more and more bitcoiners
[20:24] are coming together they're meeting in
[20:26] Bitcoin conferences they're meeting in
[20:27] local meetups this idea of sound money
[20:30] in the digital world is now on the table
[20:32] is now here and it will not go away even
[20:35] if Bitcoin goes away which I don't think
[20:37] it will but even if this goes away it's
[20:40] just a matter of time till we figure out
[20:43] why did Bitcoin die let's figure
[20:45] something out how does it how does it
[20:47] not die so it will be will be very
[20:50] interesting to see a future where where
[20:51] this is going and I think as as as your
[20:55] podcast is I think not that don't think
[20:58] that bitco will ever die uh but which is
[21:00] also interesting um uh when when you Tom
[21:03] you you lived through the the internet
[21:05] thing and you made also this comparison
[21:07] with um uh the the fat around the
[21:11] internet thing where like oh the
[21:12] internet will not be around the fax
[21:14] machine will not be around um is it
[21:17] similar now to bitcoin like do do you
[21:19] see the the the lines in the
[21:22] newsletters newspapers uh the lines in
[21:25] in in media Outlets is this like really
[21:28] compared because I there's this one
[21:31] really popular meme in Bitcoin uh where
[21:33] it's like internet might be just a fat
[21:37] passing by something like that New York
[21:39] Times probably made it I don't remember
[21:42] uh exactly but something like that and
[21:44] we have the same thing with with Bitcoin
[21:47] uh and everybody underestimated internet
[21:49] everybody underestimated Bitcoin every
[21:52] underestimated even electricity at some
[21:54] point was like no it will be bad people
[21:57] will die and stuff like that so
[21:59] you have always this this F is this is
[22:01] this actually compared because I only
[22:03] know it from history
[22:06] books well that's a a very good uh
[22:11] comment there because going back in time
[22:15] um and again uh I can remember with the
[22:17] old rotary telephone uh and just to
[22:21] share with you um somewhat ancient
[22:24] history those old telephon had what was
[22:26] called a party line meaning that Trey
[22:29] and I would have been on the same line
[22:32] and that if Trey wanted to talk to
[22:34] someone I could listen in but I couldn't
[22:37] talk so and I look at how this
[22:40] technology has changed over the last
[22:43] six0 years especially in the 21st
[22:45] century is just mind blocking how fast
[22:49] this technology has changed and of
[22:51] course I look back to the people say you
[22:52] know hey it's not going to work you know
[22:54] I don't like this I don't like that I'm
[22:58] a farm boy grew up on the farm and I can
[23:00] remember how my grandfather what have
[23:03] you they still used the horse because in
[23:06] their mind that was the most reliable uh
[23:09] machine on the farm but now you have
[23:12] tractors that are being Guided by GPS so
[23:16] that clearly shows how this technology
[23:20] has changed the way we live and changed
[23:22] the way we will live and for those
[23:24] people who just refus to turn the 20th
[23:27] century a little
[23:30] um I'm sorry for
[23:32] you because this not if we would say
[23:35] you're not going to put this cat back in
[23:37] the bag not
[23:39] now definitely I already can say that
[23:42] your podcast together the two of you
[23:44] will be really popular I feel like uh
[23:47] you you make a great great um I'm not an
[23:51] English speaker so the only word that I
[23:53] have now is couple but there's probably
[23:55] a better one for for two oh
[23:58] we we're a great
[24:00] couple couple tag team I so I call him I
[24:04] call him tax man right like I I I've
[24:06] known him for 12 years and yeah it's
[24:09] been about 12 years now and ever since
[24:11] my introduction to him I just called him
[24:13] hey tax man and I would go get my taxes
[24:15] done by him and I would pay him in
[24:16] dollars and Pie right I'd give him some
[24:19] pies um and our relationship just grew
[24:21] over time and then one day uh I was I
[24:24] had just gotten my I think it was my
[24:26] second job in crypto we were talking
[24:29] about crypto while I was doing while we
[24:31] were I think sellling taxes for the year
[24:34] right and then like it became like this
[24:36] back and forth tip fortat over a number
[24:38] of
[24:39] months where I we would talk about it a
[24:42] little bit over the phone or we'd run
[24:43] into each other and then he would
[24:45] disappear like I wouldn't hear from him
[24:46] for a couple of weeks and then he would
[24:48] come back with new questions and then he
[24:49] would disappear and then he'd come back
[24:50] with new questions and then when we got
[24:52] to mining when we got to talking about
[24:55] how like mining operations work in
[24:56] Bitcoin
[24:58] uh his initial response was very like oh
[25:01] that's that's very interesting I I
[25:02] didn't know that work that way or like
[25:03] how does this you know he was very
[25:05] interested and then a couple of days
[25:06] later he calls me and the first words
[25:08] out of his mouth I was like hello and he
[25:10] was like I want a mine baby I want a
[25:12] mine and so so we got together and that
[25:15] kind of that's when the door really
[25:16] opened for both of us to working
[25:18] together towards Bitcoin was we started
[25:20] working together planning to figure out
[25:22] or figuring out how to plan a mining
[25:24] operation and through like a weird
[25:26] series of events we ended up meeting
[25:28] some young guys who had recently bought
[25:30] a tobacco facility nearby and in North
[25:32] Carolina we're kind of like the tobacco
[25:35] capital of the United States or at least
[25:36] to my knowledge we are and the tobacco
[25:40] facility we ended up at is a big
[25:42] industrial facility that used to produce
[25:43] like a lot of cigarettes first buildings
[25:45] were built in like the 1890s I was very
[25:47] early very early place but it was it was
[25:51] almost like a a really unique experience
[25:54] because for the when we first when we
[25:57] first really talked to the owner about
[25:58] mining Bitcoin tax man we we started
[26:01] talking together and Taxman said that my
[26:03] grandfather used to deliver Taco tobacco
[26:06] to this facility when he farmed tobacco
[26:10] and correct me if I'm wrong on anything
[26:11] here tax man but if I remember correctly
[26:13] you were effectively saying that that
[26:15] facility was part of what put food on
[26:17] the table for you guys when you were
[26:18] kids yeah and so fast forward 40 years
[26:21] 50 years and here we are mining Bitcoin
[26:23] in the exact same facility and we you
[26:26] know I we get we've we've been lucky
[26:29] enough to really tour the facility we
[26:30] know the owners really well um and our
[26:32] miners have been running there now for
[26:34] roughly 2ish years give or take roughly
[26:37] two years um and so we've learned a lot
[26:40] about Bitcoin through that process we've
[26:41] learned a lot about energy uh We've
[26:43] really expanded I think everyone's
[26:45] knowledge in our general sphere on
[26:47] technology and Bitcoin and as we
[26:49] progressed we realized that the more and
[26:51] more people we talk to that even though
[26:54] we thought Bitcoin was the greatest
[26:56] thing since slic bread and we were all
[26:57] hyped up about it and we thought
[26:58] everybody else would kind of feel the
[27:00] same we ran into a lot of roadblocks and
[27:02] a lot of like negativity from people and
[27:04] I'm sure that you do even now with the
[27:05] point of sale at your place I'm sure you
[27:07] run into people so when we started the
[27:09] podcast the idea was that our community
[27:11] is getting left behind right Bitcoin
[27:13] conferences if you go to one and I
[27:15] haven't been to a Bitcoin only
[27:16] conference but I've been to a couple
[27:17] crypto conferences and what it always
[27:19] seems like is it's one bitcoiner for the
[27:21] sake of argument let's just say
[27:23] bitcoiner it's one bitcoiner talking to
[27:25] another bitcoiner about how awesome
[27:26] Bitcoin is and how they can get together
[27:27] to make some more Bitcoin that's kind of
[27:30] what these conferences become whereas
[27:32] when I walk out on the street dressed
[27:33] like George Washington holding a sign
[27:36] that says you know there is no red there
[27:38] is no blue there is the state and there
[27:39] is you you know Bitcoin is your your
[27:42] Escape Route I get laughed at you know I
[27:45] get I get heckled I get I get negative
[27:47] feedback I get occasional positive
[27:48] comments and so our podcast became we're
[27:51] gonna take the fight directly to our
[27:53] community we're going to sit down with
[27:54] our community Leaders with our with our
[27:56] school systems with anyone who will talk
[27:59] to us from blueco collar worker guys to
[28:02] moms to you know like teachers anybody
[28:06] because they all need to understand and
[28:07] because their proximity to bitcoin isn't
[28:09] that close they're not in the it field
[28:11] they're not in the cryptocurrency field
[28:13] they only get what the news tells them
[28:14] and that's not enough for them to jump
[28:16] ship and join Bitcoin somebody has to
[28:18] sit down with them and be like you know
[28:20] why teachers don't get paid enough it's
[28:22] because the goal isn't the goal isn't to
[28:24] educate students the goal is to make
[28:25] money and that's why you see corruption
[28:27] at school board and you see corruption
[28:29] at you know all these different levels
[28:30] within the school system so how about we
[28:32] just talk to this the school system and
[28:34] be like look you can say what you want
[28:37] but the numbers don't lie right we can
[28:38] throw millions of dollars of of Revenue
[28:41] at you every year and nothing gets
[28:43] better so either you suck and you're
[28:45] terrible or your money sucks and your
[28:46] money's terrible because I don't believe
[28:49] that your like our school board or
[28:50] anybody like that in our community is a
[28:52] bad they're just working in the system
[28:54] that they're working in so it's like
[28:55] look at this other system let us help
[28:58] you let's mine Bitcoin at school let's
[29:00] put a minor in there and let the kids
[29:02] learn how to mine Bitcoin in 8th 9th
[29:04] 10th grade let's let them start thinking
[29:06] about energy and all these things come
[29:08] together on our podcast when we sit down
[29:10] and talk about uh this exact thing with
[29:13] our community so uh my relationship with
[29:16] Tom has developed from hey I have a
[29:18] question about Bitcoin to a podcast and
[29:20] a mining operation where we're trying to
[29:21] get everybody to invest in Bitcoin and
[29:23] everybody to join us so it's a weird
[29:25] thing but it's been a real fun ride and
[29:27] the another thing for me again have been
[29:30] in taxes and accounting and bookkeeping
[29:33] and economics and the whole concept of
[29:35] business is also the whole blockchain
[29:37] technology there in fact I think I first
[29:40] read about the blockchain technology you
[29:43] again going back to the farm the
[29:44] agricultural
[29:46] world that it was being used to track
[29:49] animals from a farm and I was like wow
[29:52] this is pretty amazing yeah so of course
[29:55] when I got to talking to Trey and he
[29:56] began to share with me the con concept
[29:58] of Bitcoin and Mining I begin to connect
[30:01] the dots of the whole blockchain
[30:04] technology and again this technology is
[30:08] not going away and that's what in the
[30:10] message that I have for small businesses
[30:12] because I'm really big on small
[30:14] businesses entrepreneurship look if you
[30:16] want to go in business for yourself you
[30:18] want to control your destiny you got to
[30:21] control your money and right now you
[30:23] can't control your money because it's
[30:25] controlled by the politicians and the
[30:27] bureaucrat in the Central Banking
[30:29] network is there but if you want to be
[30:31] in control of your destiny if you want
[30:34] to ensure that what you doing that
[30:36] you're GNA achieve your dreams you need
[30:38] to look at
[30:41] Bitcoin I love it so much um Bitcoin
[30:44] manone is also a really interesting
[30:46] thing that you're doing because I feel
[30:48] like it's becoming a more more
[30:50] specialized industry where you have to
[30:52] have like equipment and you have to like
[30:54] when you zoom back like 10 15 years uh
[30:58] it's okay if you have just a laptop and
[30:59] you can mine a few Bitcoins a day now
[31:01] you have to really have a big farm and
[31:03] you have to have specialized equipment
[31:05] would you still recommend regular people
[31:08] that maybe have a solar roof or
[31:10] something like that uh to to mine
[31:13] Bitcoin or even someone that has just an
[31:15] apartment that wants to mine Bitcoin is
[31:17] is that still is is that something that
[31:19] you recommend or more like ah just put
[31:22] it in Bitcoin and don't
[31:24] mining I mean I think I think it's
[31:26] easier to get Bitcoin if you just buy it
[31:28] but you're missing out on a lot
[31:31] like if if your goal is to accumulate as
[31:33] much Bitcoin as possible as fast as
[31:36] possible then and you have the resources
[31:38] to do it just buy it but if you're
[31:40] talking about the average everyday
[31:41] person what Bitcoin mining teaches you
[31:44] is actually how Bitcoin kind of works
[31:47] because you have you have the mining
[31:49] operation itself so you need to
[31:50] understand a little bit about uh what
[31:52] what's going on right you have payouts
[31:55] so you need to understand a little bit
[31:56] about wallets and where that money goes
[31:59] you have uh electrical cost so you start
[32:01] to really understand what your areas's
[32:03] electrical costs are and where you can
[32:05] find cheaper electricity which then
[32:06] eventually leads you to understanding
[32:08] energy which has really been one of the
[32:10] outside of Bitcoin understanding
[32:11] Energy's probably been one of the bigger
[32:13] breakthroughs that I've had personally
[32:15] um so and it's kyc potentially kyc free
[32:19] Bitcoin uh depending on you know how you
[32:21] operate so yes you can get more if you
[32:24] just outright buy it and it's faster and
[32:26] it's probably better for anybody who's
[32:28] just looking to get started but you
[32:30] could there's so many gotu with that
[32:33] because you could just buy Bitcoin leave
[32:34] it on an exchange that exchange goes
[32:36] down something happens to that exchange
[32:37] and now you hate Bitcoin because you
[32:39] lost your money whereas Bitcoin mining
[32:42] you can kind of do the same thing by
[32:43] leaving your your Bitcoin in the pool
[32:45] but for the most part if you're mining
[32:47] you're already at the point where you're
[32:48] starting to understand wallets and the
[32:50] general idea of bitcoin's location and
[32:52] in its relationship to you um M mining
[32:56] is that's why I think schools should do
[32:57] it it because it's a fun it's
[32:59] fundamental energy it's fundamental uh
[33:01] it's fundamental educational energy it's
[33:03] fundamental educational Bitcoin it's
[33:05] fundamental education on it because you
[33:07] hit the network you have potential
[33:09] problems with firewalls you have
[33:10] potential problems with um you know all
[33:12] kinds of it related things you have
[33:14] problems with heating it teaches you so
[33:16] much that it's unbelievable like me two
[33:17] years ago before I ever touched an Asic
[33:20] or a Bitcoin miner I knew I knew enough
[33:22] about Bitcoin to be uh to say I could
[33:26] survive in a Bitcoin environment if I
[33:28] had to I I knew how to transact I knew
[33:31] the basic fundamentals I knew how to
[33:32] check price I knew how I knew what a SAT
[33:34] was but once I got into mining it just
[33:36] exploded and my knowledge just started
[33:38] ramping up at at probably one of the
[33:40] fastest Pace as far as me learning
[33:42] something new it's probably one of the
[33:43] fastest things I ever learned was
[33:45] because turn on the minor oh now it's
[33:47] hot now I have to learn heat management
[33:49] like immediately not tomorrow but like
[33:51] at this moment um we have eight
[33:54] immersion miners so we have eight miners
[33:56] that are in an immersion tank so then
[33:57] that became now I need to learn how to
[33:59] be in a be a plumber basically I need to
[34:01] understand how pumps work then you know
[34:04] talking to kind of your regular Joe
[34:06] electricians uh they don't necessarily
[34:09] know what you know type of requirements
[34:11] you have should you have a 20 amp
[34:12] breaker or a 30 amp breaker on each
[34:14] machine you know all the like what's a
[34:16] pdu you know where do those come from
[34:18] how many pdus can fit on there what size
[34:20] breakers on the pdu all these things
[34:22] come up when you start mining Bitcoin so
[34:24] yeah I think everybody should mine it I
[34:26] think you should have a miner at home I
[34:27] got one one right behind me I think you
[34:30] should I think you should mind as much
[34:31] as damn possible
[34:34] really I love process as you mind mind
[34:38] you learn the concept of doing business
[34:41] because as Trey just mentioned you've
[34:43] got to incorporate all these other
[34:45] moving parts to make this thing work
[34:48] well if you want to go in business you
[34:50] got to understand there's a lot of
[34:51] moving parts to being in business you
[34:54] got to understand the cost you got to
[34:57] understand what to sell that product for
[34:59] and what have you but the thing about
[35:01] Bitcoin is that once you have mined the
[35:04] Bitcoin the market dictates the value
[35:08] and so of course it's tied directly to
[35:09] supply and demand and we all know that
[35:12] supply is getting smaller and smaller
[35:14] but the demand is going to continue to
[35:16] grow and those are the basic building
[35:19] blocks of being in business for yourself
[35:21] you can have the greatest ideas in the
[35:22] world but if the market is flooded
[35:26] nobody's going to want to buy it but if
[35:28] you got a product where the supply is
[35:30] beginning to decrease decrease basically
[35:33] every day and demand continue to
[35:35] increase how you going to lose money if
[35:37] you are listening to this podcast you
[35:39] might be wondering what is actually the
[35:41] setup look like of Robin or how can I
[35:44] improve my Bitcoin setup and there's two
[35:46] things you have to buy Bitcoin from the
[35:48] right source and you have to store
[35:50] Bitcoin the right way let's focus on the
[35:52] first thing how to buy Bitcoin it's
[35:54] simple have a Bitcoin only exchange
[35:57] don't don't deal with the shitcoin
[35:58] exchanges don't deal with an exchange
[36:00] that has an own token or something like
[36:02] that be on a Bitcoin only exchange I use
[36:05] 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is for me the best
[36:08] partner for that and now where do you
[36:11] store Bitcoin Bitcoin should be stored
[36:13] on a hardware wallet on a self custody
[36:16] solution where you yourself hold your
[36:19] keys and it should be a cold wallet so
[36:22] that's my Simple Solutions that's a
[36:25] bitbox you just put your Bitcoin on
[36:27] there back up your seat fras and you are
[36:30] better than 95% of all Bitcoin hodlers
[36:34] if you have more than a, in Bitcoin it's
[36:37] an absolutely must have one last thing
[36:40] before we get back to the video I'm
[36:41] really passionate about meeting other
[36:43] bitcoiners and there's an amazing
[36:45] opportunity in middle of Europe in June
[36:49] the Bitcoin BR conference it's the best
[36:52] and biggest Bitcoin only conference in
[36:55] whole of Europe for all Americans please
[36:57] visit Europe and visit this place in
[36:59] June for all europes it's a must go
[37:02] anyways you are so close to the Bitcoin
[37:04] PR conference you basically have to come
[37:07] I will do interviews there and I would
[37:09] love to meet you all there use code
[37:12] Robin for all my sponsors to get
[37:14] discounts and use the links down in the
[37:16] description it's fascinating to see the
[37:18] mining industry and for me it's always
[37:22] to interesting to see uh when I
[37:25] encounter people that don't research
[37:29] Bitcoin deeply but they read some
[37:33] headlines uh and then there's a lot of
[37:35] the energy F going on around Bitcoin
[37:37] mining uh and they really look on a
[37:41] really surface level of of Bitcoin um do
[37:44] you like when whatever I like when I see
[37:48] this newspaper and putting that that
[37:50] headline out like oh Bitcoin uses that
[37:52] much energy like double Deb of Austria
[37:55] or something like that I'm always
[37:56] thinking like
[37:58] why are they making those news articles
[38:01] why are they not presenting also the
[38:03] other side like why are they not giving
[38:05] like a whole picture on on the thing and
[38:08] like presenting more of the stuff uh
[38:10] where do you think like this this this
[38:12] mining energy f is coming from and um do
[38:16] do you see it as like now a little bit
[38:19] dampen like now it seems like less less
[38:21] people talk about it and less and less
[38:24] uh it comes up but do you still see it
[38:26] as coming up and do still see it as
[38:28] something that you encounter with
[38:30] Bitcoin
[38:31] mining it it seems like it it comes and
[38:34] goes right sometimes there's a lot of
[38:36] fud going on about bitcoin's energy
[38:38] consumptions and then other times you
[38:40] know you'll get like a positive spin
[38:43] from a group that normally doesn't have
[38:44] a positive spin on bitcoin due to some
[38:46] additional research they've done but I
[38:49] think the root of it is
[38:51] that the media is one of the like the
[38:54] pin is mightier than the sword type of
[38:55] deal the media is one of the most
[38:56] powerful organizations ation on the
[38:58] planet and it doesn't really matter what
[38:59] country or what media organization
[39:02] you're talking about they can all be
[39:03] weaponized in the same way if they
[39:05] aren't yet it's likely a matter of time
[39:07] before any news organization is
[39:09] weaponized and the people that control
[39:11] the new news or news organizations are
[39:13] deeply rooted in The Current financial
[39:15] system it's an engine for producing
[39:17] money and through the way that they
[39:20] generally do it is just through views
[39:22] and we all know that outrage typically
[39:24] gets more views like a cute story about
[39:26] a bunch of puppies is great but run over
[39:29] that same group of puppies and that's a
[39:30] much bigger story right no I mean it
[39:33] just is right I don't want to run over
[39:34] puppies I like puppies but I mean
[39:35] generally speaking if you were to do
[39:37] that and see which one gets the most
[39:38] views it's the car um that said people
[39:43] don't understand energy the
[39:44] fundamentally they don't understand
[39:45] energy I just got back from Texas and I
[39:47] got the opportunity to tour some sites
[39:49] in Texas and I was in the energy I don't
[39:51] know if it's an energy Capital but it's
[39:53] definitely a big oil and gas place in
[39:55] Texas um and while I was there
[39:59] you you could tell that many miners that
[40:00] were there were running as efficiently
[40:02] as possible close to the energy sources
[40:05] utilizing Renewables uh utilizing wasted
[40:08] energy I mean I'm so deep down the
[40:10] energy rabbit hole that we've I mean
[40:13] he's a he's come he comes from a farming
[40:15] background so when I tell you this next
[40:16] thing it might you'll see the connection
[40:19] we got the idea that look how much hog
[40:21] waste from from swine or pigs in North
[40:23] Carolina there is it's a major problem
[40:25] we have like lagoons they're called
[40:27] lagons filled with just hog waste and it
[40:29] might be hundreds of thousands of
[40:30] gallons of hog waste sitting in an open
[40:33] Lagoon open to the air polluting the
[40:34] ground potentially causing issues in the
[40:36] community so on so forth what happens if
[40:39] I back up a shipping container and suck
[40:41] up all that waste and then use the
[40:43] methane off that waste of my Bitcoin and
[40:44] then turn the rest into the fertilizer
[40:46] and I got so deep down this hole that
[40:48] right now in my backyard there's a 55
[40:50] gallon bucket filled with hog waste that
[40:52] I was trying to see how much methane I
[40:53] can get off 55 gallons and run a small
[40:55] generator as a proof of concept
[40:57] well it turns out that it's hard to do
[40:59] that during the winter time unless you
[41:00] can heat the the the contents of the
[41:03] container which I could do with a
[41:05] Bitcoin minor but I just never made it
[41:07] that far now we're on kind of a
[41:09] different Journey where we're exploring
[41:10] ideas like what happens if I open a tire
[41:13] shop off the side of the interstate here
[41:15] you know in in North Carolina and say
[41:18] free tire disposal here and I do
[41:20] standard tire work you know I change
[41:22] tires and sell tires and I change oil
[41:25] and sell oil and whatnot but except I
[41:27] take all the tires that are either given
[41:29] to me because people need to get rid of
[41:30] them or that I take from customers that
[41:32] got tires changed and I put them through
[41:34] a process that turns them back into Fuel
[41:35] and then my Bitcoin I can I can lower
[41:38] the cost of getting your tires and your
[41:40] oil changed I can make tire recycling
[41:42] from a customer standpoint effectively
[41:44] free because I want your tires so you
[41:46] can come drop them off with me so now
[41:48] I've got a business model that a tire
[41:50] shop can make money an oil shop can make
[41:52] money so I have a business that makes
[41:55] dollars in general but on the back side
[41:57] it uses the waste from that business to
[41:59] mine Bitcoin and I only have a couple of
[42:01] miners so it wouldn't take that many
[42:02] tires for me to pull this off
[42:05] operationally um it's just a matter of
[42:08] figuring out and putting these things
[42:09] together and that's where I'm always
[42:12] kind of at mentally is how do I take the
[42:13] miners that I have and put them on a an
[42:16] energy source that's based on waste
[42:18] either hog waste Tire waste plastic
[42:20] waste I mean vegetable waste you name it
[42:23] and I'm probably trying to figure out
[42:24] how to do it because it's effectively
[42:27] free people will just throw out food
[42:28] they'll throw out waste there's tires
[42:30] everywhere if you
[42:32] associate like an economy to waste then
[42:35] all of a sudden waste becomes valuable
[42:37] people will bring you waste I you can
[42:39] you can look at the Copper there's a
[42:40] problem in the United States right now
[42:42] where in certain communities if you
[42:43] leave copper out even to include the
[42:45] copper that's inside of your air
[42:47] conditioner if it's not secure people
[42:49] will come steal it they'll come cut it
[42:50] straight out of your air conditioner
[42:52] because copper has value so what do you
[42:54] what do I think is going to happen is
[42:56] what happens if I if I assign a value to
[42:59] scrap tires and I say hey I'll pay you a
[43:02] dollar per I don't know 100 pounds of
[43:05] tires which is be like three tires or
[43:07] four tires right I'll pay you a dollar
[43:09] per 100 pounds of tires or something how
[43:12] many tires will show up until I find
[43:14] like an equilibrium probably not many at
[43:17] first but if you're running a business
[43:19] that collects tires as part of your
[43:20] business and you have to pay to get rid
[43:22] of them because the the regular trash D
[43:24] won't take them unless you pay why
[43:26] wouldn't you bring them to me let me pay
[43:27] you a dollar for 100 pound you know this
[43:31] concept of
[43:32] energy and how it ties together with
[43:34] Bitcoin really makes you wonder these
[43:36] things and it kind of eats at you you
[43:38] you can't sleep at night because you're
[43:39] thinking about hog poop and tires it's
[43:41] the craziest [ __ ]
[43:43] right and back to your question there as
[43:48] to uh why is this negative news uh to
[43:52] bitcoin well as you begin to understand
[43:55] money in the history of money you begin
[43:57] to come to the conclusion is to keep you
[43:59] a slave if I can keep you a slave and
[44:03] control your money then you always going
[44:05] to have to obey me and follow what I
[44:07] want but if I take away those shackles
[44:11] and give you the freedom to control your
[44:15] life and control your financial reward
[44:18] then you're not a slave anymore and
[44:20] that's the thing and people get all hung
[44:23] up about trying to Define what is a
[44:25] slave and what have you but the key
[44:26] thing about being a slave you are
[44:29] dependent upon the master well if you're
[44:31] not dependent upon the master then you
[44:34] control your own future in your own
[44:36] destiny so you're actually in control of
[44:39] your life and what do you hear everybody
[44:41] talking about what I want to do with my
[44:42] life you know again talking about my
[44:44] grandchildren and what have you you know
[44:45] what you gonna do with your life what
[44:46] are you going to do with your life well
[44:48] you want to control your life you want
[44:50] to be productive with your life you want
[44:52] to enhance your life as well as the
[44:55] people around you well how can you you
[44:57] do that if you are a slave to somebody
[45:00] else's money but if you control your
[45:02] money your destiny then you going to
[45:05] build a
[45:07] world yeah H this is one of the the
[45:11] first thing first tweets I made like
[45:14] last year that went a little bit viral
[45:16] where I actually made the comparison
[45:18] between uh people in the fear world and
[45:21] slaves and I actually went like through
[45:23] a lot of definitions of slaves I went
[45:25] through the history of slaves slavery
[45:27] uh and I got to see a lot of
[45:30] similarities obviously there are differ
[45:32] but there are a lot of similarities in
[45:35] there and it's it it uh it's an
[45:38] interesting intersection to go do yeah I
[45:42] don't really need to control your your
[45:44] person as much as I need to control your
[45:47] time if I want to control you if I can
[45:49] make you go to work because you have to
[45:51] earn money because you have to pay for
[45:52] things and I can simply devalue your
[45:56] money and make work longer or more or
[45:58] harder and be able to buy less then I
[46:00] can control whatever I want I I have a
[46:02] lot of friends in the Second Amendment
[46:03] community and their argument about
[46:06] Bitcoin typically is well what happens
[46:08] when they come and take it you know what
[46:10] happens when they come knock on your
[46:11] door and they're like we're going to
[46:12] take this Bitcoin or we're going to you
[46:14] know arrest you and imprison you um and
[46:18] the the the answer is yet like you have
[46:19] a a right to self-defense but in the end
[46:22] they can only take it from you if you
[46:23] give it to them and that's that's the
[46:26] newest that that's never existed before
[46:28] like for the first time in human history
[46:30] we can all United like as one human
[46:32] entity say against the powers that be we
[46:35] don't need you anymore you can't do this
[46:37] anymore because we have another option
[46:39] that you can't stop you can kill us you
[46:41] can kill a whole bunch of us but in the
[46:43] end the idea will live on and it will
[46:46] continue and it's the first time in
[46:48] human history we've ever been able to
[46:49] say that every other time was a select
[46:51] group of humans asking for a select
[46:53] group of Rights from someone who just
[46:55] had to grant them those rights or grant
[46:57] them the freedom to execute those rights
[47:00] whereas now it's like I don't have to
[47:01] ask your permission anymore like this is
[47:04] this is a Magna Carta moment but for the
[47:06] entire world it's the first Declaration
[47:08] of real independence from a state and
[47:12] money and financial control that's ever
[47:14] existed before this even under the gold
[47:16] standard they just come beat you to
[47:18] death and take it and you can do that
[47:19] with Bitcoin sure you can come and and
[47:21] rob me and try to get my you know my uh
[47:24] my words or whatnot my wallet but you
[47:26] have to find it and if you can't find it
[47:28] or if it just simply doesn't exist
[47:30] except outside of my mind I have to give
[47:32] it to you otherwise there's nothing you
[47:33] can do about it you can people always
[47:35] complain about kyc Bitcoin and and
[47:37] whether or not people know uh what your
[47:39] Bitcoin address is like the IRS or the
[47:41] government they're going to know right
[47:43] this is the biggest deal since nuclear
[47:45] war they're going to figure out who you
[47:47] are it's not going to take them that
[47:48] long the CIA is not like a friendly kind
[47:51] of half-ass dumb organization they will
[47:53] figure out who you are and so if you're
[47:55] not here for the fight if you're not
[47:56] here for for that knock on the door uh
[47:59] you're not fully in yet I'm so deep in
[48:01] where it's like if Bitcoin goes down
[48:03] like I'm not sure what to do with the
[48:05] rest of my life like honestly like what
[48:07] I don't know what like what other fight
[48:09] do I have you know like I'm not going to
[48:11] go fight on behalf of my country anymore
[48:13] because my my my country is generally
[48:15] waging Wars over dollars I'm not going
[48:18] to go fight for the dollar anymore like
[48:19] it's not a thing and so I I don't think
[48:23] in the long term that
[48:26] it will matter I think the United States
[48:28] and and other entities will adopt
[48:29] Bitcoin because they have to but for
[48:31] right now to come back to where we
[48:33] started it is a form of Slavery to
[48:35] control someone's time someone's money
[48:37] because they simply can't escape they
[48:39] can't go anywhere and if you look at El
[48:42] saor and I say F Salvador is the best
[48:45] example that you can have of course the
[48:48] economy has turned around but even more
[48:50] important the people are not living as a
[48:54] slave to the criminals because of course
[48:57] the the president um he had a pretty
[48:59] well of a blanket policy there he locked
[49:01] up a lot of people and took the
[49:03] criminals off the street but even more
[49:06] important why would I Rob Trent when I
[49:10] can't get his information it's nothing
[49:13] there so he could have a million dollars
[49:15] in his pocket you know boom hit him in
[49:17] the head take the money but he could
[49:19] have a million dollars in his wallet and
[49:21] what good is the wallet if I can't get
[49:23] into it and that's the big thing that
[49:26] took place in El Salvador is they took
[49:28] away the motive to commit harm and to
[49:32] steal and Rob from
[49:34] people it's a crazy thing it's it's it's
[49:37] giving uh property rights back finally
[49:40] uh to the
[49:42] individual which means you're not a
[49:44] slave see if you're a slave you can't
[49:46] own property but if you own property
[49:50] you're not a
[49:51] slave what what would that do to the
[49:54] power structures like we have all the
[49:56] the the power structures the governments
[49:59] the CIA the IRS like in America now the
[50:02] same thing happening in Europe in China
[50:04] there's a whole another story but what
[50:07] will Bitcoin do in the long run do do
[50:09] those power structures uh do you have
[50:11] like an imagination what what can happen
[50:12] to them bend the
[50:16] knee that's my that's my comment bend
[50:18] the bend the knee
[50:21] because you can't you can't argue with
[50:24] math and you can't game theory is real
[50:27] in my opinion you will always act in
[50:28] your own best interest and if your own
[50:30] best interest is to to maintain the
[50:32] current system you will try to do so but
[50:34] the moment your own best interests do
[50:35] not align with maintaining the current
[50:37] system it doesn't matter really who you
[50:38] are you will either convert or be
[50:41] converted right this is like a gunpowder
[50:43] moment China discovers gunpowder it
[50:46] wasn't up to the Europeans to just not
[50:48] adopt gunpowder you either adopt it or
[50:51] you don't and either way when in terms
[50:53] of of a of of being willing to work with
[50:56] a new new technology everyone was forced
[50:58] to bend the KN of gunpowder everyone was
[51:00] forced to bend the we bend the KN to the
[51:02] wheel and everybody will be forced to
[51:04] bend the KN of Bitcoin because there the
[51:06] other option is to continue to allow
[51:08] someone else to control you in the
[51:10] devaluation of your money most people
[51:12] just don't know it yet most like if you
[51:14] look at American rap music right like
[51:16] you can take from from the
[51:19] 1990s when I was coming up and and
[51:21] listening to rap music in the 1990s
[51:23] album covers would have like nice mer
[51:26] Mercedes on them now you know like
[51:30] rappers are are way richer than than
[51:32] having a nice Mercedes and there's
[51:35] twofold right like you have inflation
[51:36] and and and the value of the dollar and
[51:38] things like that you can simply get more
[51:39] money but the the transformation between
[51:44] we have something nice into kind of what
[51:47] the current rap music scene is of it's
[51:49] just about money it's only about money
[51:52] there is no other thing most people are
[51:54] in that zone they just think about money
[51:56] they don't think about where it comes
[51:57] from if it's good or it's bad I'm
[51:59] getting ready to travel to Japan and my
[52:01] kid last night was asking me how the Yen
[52:03] Works compared to the dollar and which
[52:05] one was better was the Federal Reserve
[52:07] in okanawa or in Japan the same as the
[52:09] Federal Reserve for us and I had to
[52:11] explain to him or her all these
[52:13] different aspects of why the yen is
[52:15] different than the dollar and why the
[52:16] dollar kind of backs the Yen and how
[52:18] they're related and what just happened
[52:19] with the Yen and the Federal Reserve all
[52:21] these different things but most people
[52:23] aren't even at that level of like my
[52:25] 17-year-old kid they're just not there
[52:27] they're not thinking about it and so the
[52:30] power structures once people start to
[52:32] realize this and it's not a matter of if
[52:33] it's a matter of when Once people start
[52:36] to realize this and gen it might be a
[52:39] generational change it might be a
[52:40] multigenerational change but the power
[52:42] structures they rely on our willing
[52:44] obedience and once our willing obedience
[52:46] is removed because we have an
[52:48] alternative system that we control then
[52:50] the power structure will have no choice
[52:52] either kill us or bend the knee and you
[52:53] can kill us if you want to you can you
[52:55] can sit on a throne on top of hell but
[52:57] it's still going to be hell so make your
[52:59] choice and also it will put the powers
[53:02] to be out of business it's a it's big
[53:04] thing yeah Bitcoin only Bitcoin allows
[53:07] you to only pay taxes you agree
[53:10] with which also is like the the common
[53:14] theme when I ask Bitcoin is how to
[53:16] imagine the political system in the
[53:19] future on a Bitcoin standard most tend
[53:22] to like of course um if there is a
[53:25] service from a government or there's a
[53:28] service from an individual thing that I
[53:30] want to pay for for example there's a
[53:32] the road that I'll travel I I'm I'm
[53:34] prepared to pay a fee because they have
[53:36] to maintain the road uh I'm prepared to
[53:39] pay fees but it should be optional now
[53:42] not like forced okay yeah I'm traveling
[53:44] on the road I should pay for the for the
[53:46] road that I'm traveling to it's it's
[53:48] it's normal just like when I go to a
[53:50] restaurant they're making me food of
[53:51] course I have to pay for that because
[53:52] they provided me value I will provide
[53:54] them value back uh so so it will be
[53:56] really interesting to see it probably
[53:58] will will be long long fight and a long
[54:01] Revolution but Bitcoin and that's a
[54:04] fantastic thing Bitcoin is the first
[54:05] revolution in history um where when you
[54:08] take part in it you actually get richer
[54:12] with it and you actually get uh more
[54:15] resources over time because Bitcoin is
[54:17] the scarcest asset it's the best money
[54:19] and uh in all the other revolutions at
[54:22] least that I know of maybe you can
[54:24] correct me um when you took part of the
[54:27] Revolution you got maybe something in
[54:30] the end more freedom usually but the way
[54:34] to towards it was really heavy was
[54:36] really bad you got away with your money
[54:38] like it's it was usually like a bad
[54:40] thing During the Revolution you have to
[54:42] be really hard in that it G is like a um
[54:45] a revolution on steroids because you
[54:47] actually get rewarded for taking part in
[54:50] it which is a fascinating uh thing to
[54:52] think
[54:54] about yeah I mean
[54:56] I'm I'm here for the fight I didn't pick
[54:59] this fight because I wanted a fight but
[55:00] once I understood what was going on I'm
[55:04] 100% here for the fight and because I'm
[55:06] I'm not a public entity per se right I'm
[55:08] not like a big face in the
[55:10] world but I will be if I'm successful in
[55:13] in any of my Endeavors I I will be at
[55:15] least known and if anybody's watching
[55:17] they'll know who I am they'll likely
[55:19] know where I'm from and they can easily
[55:22] decide to come after me whatever power
[55:24] that may be from a you know a person
[55:27] that I know that gets upset with
[55:28] something to the IRS or to the United
[55:31] States government like I'm not it's I'm
[55:33] not going to be unknown but that's the
[55:34] only way I can fight this fight I don't
[55:36] know how to wear like a green suit and
[55:37] show up to conferences and talk about
[55:38] Bitcoin I'm not that eloquent what I am
[55:40] is a trailer park kid who's who's who's
[55:43] really just tired of watching people get
[55:45] [ __ ] on and the like think about how
[55:49] many single moms there are that are
[55:51] working one or two jobs that are trying
[55:53] to get their kids to school that can't
[55:55] make ends meet they're not going to
[55:57] survive like they're they're not going
[55:59] to make it and their life isn't going to
[56:01] get better because their money isn't
[56:03] going to get better sure they could get
[56:05] a better job they could they could do
[56:07] all these things to improve themselves
[56:08] but statistically it's just unlikely you
[56:11] typically kind of you know you kind of
[56:13] have a you hope you have like a a
[56:16] gradual um let's call it a come up like
[56:18] you're doing better over time up until
[56:20] about your 30s and then your 30s you're
[56:22] kind of stuck wherever you're at unless
[56:23] you make some big moves and now you're
[56:26] riding the road to retirement by the
[56:27] time you're in your 50s or 60s most
[56:29] people are slowing down they're not
[56:30] taking big risks they're they're not
[56:32] trying to move forward they're
[56:34] comfortable or they're satisfied or
[56:35] they're at least accepting of whatever
[56:37] it is that they've done in their life if
[56:39] you have a single mom who's 35 years old
[56:42] who's raising two or three kids who's
[56:44] working you know jobs that don't supply
[56:46] enough pay or benefits for her to have a
[56:47] good life it's unlikely that it's going
[56:49] to get better in her 40s or her 50s her
[56:53] time is is not on her side but if she
[56:56] Bitcoin then it is likely that in her
[56:58] 40s or 50s that things will get better
[57:00] because she will have more resources to
[57:01] expend to help her children to help
[57:04] herself so like that type of person
[57:07] can't likely can't fight the fight that
[57:09] we're fighting they can't be involved at
[57:11] this level because they don't have the
[57:12] knowledge or the resources so if I show
[57:14] up in a green suit like a you know like
[57:17] a crazy person even more so than than a
[57:19] than a George Wasington suit but if I
[57:20] show up to in a green suit and start
[57:22] trying to fight this fight I can get the
[57:23] word out there but who's going to hear
[57:25] me other people who already know if I
[57:27] want to fight this fight for the people
[57:28] in my community they have to trust me
[57:30] and they have to see me I have to be the
[57:32] face that they can come and punch when
[57:34] something goes wrong and I have to be
[57:36] the face that the community can look to
[57:38] for help when when things are going
[57:39] right and they have questions if I was
[57:42] afraid to fight this fight which is not
[57:44] necessarily that I'm without fear but if
[57:46] I wouldn't fight this fight then I would
[57:48] watch my community go down while I came
[57:50] up and that doesn't seem like a good
[57:52] situation for me what seems like a
[57:54] better situation for me is to just get
[57:56] out there my life's only so long you
[57:58] know if I die at if I die at 40 if I die
[58:01] at 75 the difference is only a few years
[58:03] for my perspective but the impact that I
[58:06] have and the Legacy that I live to my
[58:08] community is very important I want them
[58:10] to be better after I'm gone and it isn't
[58:11] just my kids it's it's everyone so I got
[58:13] to put my face on I got to walk out in
[58:15] public and look like George Washington
[58:17] I've got to get yelled at by people I've
[58:19] got to convince folks like tax man on
[58:21] the you know on the the merits of
[58:23] Bitcoin I got to go get laughed at at
[58:25] the you know at the the bowling alley I
[58:28] got to get kind of not embarrassed but I
[58:31] know that I'm in an uphill fight every
[58:32] time I go on the golden OD old radio
[58:34] show because they believe in gold and
[58:36] the rest is over like you don't even
[58:38] need to have a conversation it's gold or
[58:40] it's gold or nothing it's gold or the
[58:41] dollar it's really the only two options
[58:43] so like this is a fight and everyone to
[58:47] include me will bend the
[58:49] knee and to teach people that with the
[58:55] Bitcoin you are actually protecting your
[58:58] labor the greatest thing we have is our
[59:01] labor that is our Capital well if you
[59:04] work and you enhance your earning
[59:07] potentials what good is it if the more
[59:09] you earn the more you tax and the more
[59:12] you is taken away from you but if your
[59:16] labor if your earning potential continue
[59:19] to increase and as it increase it gains
[59:22] value instead of losing value cuz the
[59:25] fact of it is now with the fat our
[59:26] currency your labor loses value what I
[59:30] did yesterday that value has less today
[59:34] because of the inflation and what's
[59:37] taking place with the US currency or or
[59:39] the world currency for that matter there
[59:41] so once people learn that this is a way
[59:44] to protect your labor and to protect
[59:47] what you have earned and not lose value
[59:51] the light's going to come on be like hey
[59:53] why haven't I been doing this all along
[59:57] yeah um it's it's so fascinating uh to
[60:02] see um especially the the passion that
[60:04] you to do it um do do you think uh that
[60:09] that Bitcoin can coexist with feat or is
[60:11] it like either Bitcoin or fear in the
[60:14] long run of course like right now
[60:15] they're coexisting kind of but in the
[60:17] like the long run when we talking like
[60:19] 100 200 500 years uh really it come down
[60:22] to like it's it's the base layer of our
[60:24] financial system everybody uses Bitcoin
[60:27] in some sort of sense of course with
[60:28] layer technology of course with uh
[60:30] companies on build on Tab of course with
[60:33] even L Banks could be built on top of
[60:35] Bitcoin they take this custody because
[60:37] maybe not everybody wants to have self-
[60:39] custody which I'm a big fan of that
[60:41] everybody takes the self custody but
[60:43] that's another discussion but do you
[60:44] think like governments will always issue
[60:47] their own currencies I think I think to
[60:50] a certain degree they at least in the
[60:52] near term let's say the next 50 to 100
[60:54] years they have to because the
[60:56] we can't just rip the complete Financial
[60:58] system apart and say okay now it's
[61:00] Bitcoin it would take us a long time to
[61:02] get to a point where everyday
[61:04] transactions um large transactions
[61:07] businessto business transactions bank-
[61:08] to- Bank transactions before they could
[61:10] all come up to speed and actually do it
[61:12] Bitcoin itself is capable but it's the
[61:14] people that are going to take time the
[61:15] processes the technology that needs to
[61:17] be replaced or implemented at all these
[61:18] levels so I think that in the short term
[61:21] eventually in the United States the
[61:23] dollar gets backed by Bitcoin and
[61:25] there's something that kind of similar
[61:26] to how it used to be backed by gold but
[61:28] I don't think that's the long-term thing
[61:30] I think in the long term Bitcoin just
[61:32] becomes the money and everybody who it's
[61:35] almost like a global citizenry where
[61:38] everyone in the Bitcoin Global citizenry
[61:41] transacts with with Bitcoin um maybe
[61:43] that's on a layer two or even a layer
[61:45] three version of Bitcoin but
[61:46] fundamentally Bitcoin whereas in in the
[61:49] short term I think there'll be a
[61:50] transition period where the dollar
[61:52] combats against Bitcoin and then the
[61:54] dollar is backed by Bitcoin or something
[61:56] like the dollar is backed by Bitcoin and
[61:59] then we we're going to have to fight the
[62:00] war against cbdcs at some point I'm sure
[62:02] but once we went their ass and we move
[62:04] on uh I think Bitcoin becomes the the
[62:08] endall Beall money at some point it just
[62:10] to be a transitional phase in between
[62:13] because at some point in
[62:16] time nothing last is forever of course
[62:19] and with Bitcoin until the internet
[62:23] goes kapoo the Bitcoin is going to be
[62:27] here well even if the internet went away
[62:29] which would be a really you know I don't
[62:32] even worry about Bitcoin if the internet
[62:33] goes away just try over yeah just try to
[62:35] go grocery shopping or get some money
[62:36] out of your bank like it doesn't really
[62:37] matter the internet's down so you're
[62:39] you're hosed anyway but I mean again
[62:42] it'd be like if you outlawed V8 engines
[62:44] and you took all the V8 engines away
[62:46] yeah you somebody's still going to
[62:47] create a new V8 engine so from an
[62:49] internet perspective you could still use
[62:51] mesh networks in other ways to work even
[62:53] if the internet itself was down because
[62:55] we know how to connect cables when
[62:56] people own things like switches and
[62:58] routers it wouldn't be ideal it wouldn't
[63:01] be fast but it wouldn't necessarily kill
[63:03] Bitcoin it would simply slow it down
[63:06] right it's you got a flat tire on the
[63:08] racetrack just put a new tire on you'll
[63:10] be all right which isn't really
[63:11] interesting thought to think about like
[63:13] what what what happens and and there's
[63:16] like I discussed I think like a half a
[63:18] podcast with gu Swan about what is the
[63:21] bigger Revolution the internet or
[63:23] Bitcoin which is which is in thought
[63:26] what's what are your thoughts on it so
[63:29] Bitcoin or the internet the bigger
[63:30] Revolution I think that the internet was
[63:33] the first informational Revolution after
[63:35] the printing press if you look at I mean
[63:38] I think bitcoiners talk about the
[63:39] printing press a lot but if you look at
[63:40] what happened after the printing press
[63:41] it wasn't just that people got smarter
[63:43] and religion spread it became Avail like
[63:46] people started to recognize that they
[63:48] could create knowledge and disseminate
[63:49] knowledge and because they could write
[63:52] one book and then that book could be
[63:53] copied a thousand you know a thousand
[63:55] 10,000 times
[63:56] whereas with the internet when the
[63:58] internet came around people initially
[64:00] started creating knowledge in the form
[64:01] of websites but it wasn't necessarily
[64:03] new knowledge it was knowledge that was
[64:05] already accumulated and that that
[64:07] knowledge just now needed to be packaged
[64:09] and put online and of course over time
[64:11] we've learned new things and new
[64:12] knowledge has been distributed on the
[64:13] internet and new people have access to
[64:15] that knowledge but when he get to
[64:16] bitcoin this is this is it's the same as
[64:20] the printing press in the sense that
[64:22] before the printing press knowledge and
[64:25] was the was was the valuable thing well
[64:27] now knowledge is not necessarily all
[64:28] that valuable because it's it's not
[64:30] scarce anymore good knowledge wisdom I
[64:33] might say is is valuable but just
[64:35] reading headlines and knowing 10,000
[64:37] headlines for the day isn't all that
[64:38] valuable necessarily Bitcoin is a deeper
[64:42] level it starts to solve a bigger
[64:45] problem than just you know do you have
[64:47] the knowledge it starts to solve a
[64:49] problem of how do you manage your time
[64:51] and nobody says you know what I wish I
[64:54] just if I if I a little more tomorrow
[64:57] you know I'd have more time but if you
[64:59] have more money you can definitely say
[65:01] tomorrow I have more time because you
[65:03] can then remove yourself from work right
[65:05] you don't necessarily have to go to work
[65:07] and do those things you can work for
[65:08] yourself or you can just use use your
[65:10] resources I think bitcoin's a bigger
[65:12] Revolution I think it's just the
[65:14] revolution at a deeper level yeah and
[65:16] more widespread because of course with
[65:18] the printing press it enable the regular
[65:22] everyday working guy to have access to
[65:27] the information because up until then it
[65:29] was pretty well controlled by Church the
[65:32] government what have you is to who got
[65:34] information who didn't well that's the
[65:36] thing about the internet you know boom
[65:39] you pull out your phone you tap tap tap
[65:42] and the world is open to you you know
[65:44] who would have thought 40 years ago that
[65:47] we would be having a conference and had
[65:49] talking the way we are and your Halfway
[65:52] Around the World um and I tell people
[65:55] reminds me of that old cartoon the
[65:57] Jetson that where George Jefferson gets
[66:00] in his space machine and off he goes and
[66:04] then he pulls up his video and boom it's
[66:06] there well that's where we are now we're
[66:09] living in again in the 21st century
[66:12] where more and more people have access
[66:13] to information and Bitcoin is going to
[66:16] enable people to do more and more
[66:18] business
[66:20] worldwide I love it so much um I have
[66:25] probably like
[66:26] thousand more questions to to all of the
[66:28] Bitcoin topics and um you're really fun
[66:30] to talk to um but we're coming slowly to
[66:33] the end rtin to the of the podcast which
[66:35] is also a fun one because this is the
[66:37] only question that comes from the
[66:39] previous guest like the and is uh the
[66:42] previous guest asked a question for the
[66:43] next guest without knowing who the next
[66:45] guest actually is uh and uh the your
[66:49] question uh is from the previous guest
[66:52] is you discover who SOS Nakamoto is he
[66:55] offers you 10,000 Bitcoin to C to keep
[66:58] his identity a secret do you take the
[67:00] Bitcoin uh my initial reaction is no
[67:03] because
[67:04] like I
[67:07] mean don't get me wrong I wouldn't mind
[67:09] having 10,000
[67:10] Bitcoins but if I knew who Satoshi was
[67:14] and he offered me 10,000 or they offered
[67:16] me 10,000 Bitcoins to keep my mouth
[67:19] shut I want to say that like the better
[67:22] part of me would be like I'll keep my
[67:24] mouth shut anyway because what you
[67:26] created is more important than my
[67:28] personal wealth but at the same time I'd
[67:30] probably say yeah give me the 10,000
[67:31] Bitcoin and I'll I'll still keep my
[67:33] mouth shut because 10,000 Bitcoin would
[67:35] be fantastic um but no I I wouldn't I
[67:38] wouldn't want to tell anybody either way
[67:40] well I love a mystery so uh and of
[67:43] course 10,000 Bitcoin would be very very
[67:45] tempting um but uh I agree with Trey I
[67:49] would uh not reveal who he is because of
[67:53] what has taken place and again that's
[67:56] what adds to the whole concept of
[67:58] Bitcoin you know it's kind of like that
[68:00] old you know who did it thing there and
[68:04] um I would say uh again I would sit on
[68:07] it as long as I could I would take it to
[68:09] my grave my my wife does a lot of
[68:11] genealogy research both in her own life
[68:14] like in her own genealogy and her
[68:15] friends and family and stuff that people
[68:17] are interested and she got latched on to
[68:19] Satoshi when we first started getting
[68:21] into Bitcoin she was like I don't think
[68:22] I'll figure it out she's like but I
[68:25] might look areas that other people
[68:26] haven't and she did and she found some
[68:28] fairly interesting stuff about halny I
[68:31] think it was about halny at least and if
[68:33] this makes it to YouTube or this gets
[68:35] clipped or whatever nobody quote me on
[68:36] this you know because I might have this
[68:37] wrong I didn't actually do this research
[68:39] myself but there was something about uh
[68:41] there was a relative of either Hal or
[68:44] another prominent early Bitcoin person
[68:47] that uh prior to World War II they lived
[68:50] in Hawaii and in Hawaii at the time
[68:52] there was a baseball team that they
[68:53] played on and on that team was a guy
[68:54] named Satoshi
[68:56] Nakamoto and the question was like maybe
[68:59] if if how was was actually Satoshi
[69:02] because if he didn't know how is the
[69:04] first person to receive a Bitcoin
[69:06] transaction I think from Satoshi right
[69:08] he was one of the very early bitcoiners
[69:10] he he's done all manner of things for
[69:12] Bitcoin right but I if how was Satoshi
[69:16] like in theory then could it been a
[69:18] story from how's grandfather or somebody
[69:20] like that who fought in World War II but
[69:22] just prior to that or during that was in
[69:24] Hawaii with on a baseball team with a
[69:26] guy named Satoshi Nakamoto maybe Satoshi
[69:30] and this guy's grandfather Hal's
[69:31] grandfather had a good friendship or
[69:33] they had a you know there was some
[69:35] connection between them that was beyond
[69:36] baseball and later in life how
[69:39] remembered his granddaddy talking about
[69:41] this great guy Satoshi Nakamoto who
[69:42] might have done this thing and so he
[69:44] adopted that name now obviously that's
[69:46] just absolute craziness but when you
[69:49] start going down the genealogy route and
[69:51] looking at people how they relate
[69:53] historically and then digging through
[69:54] newspapers and not looking at just
[69:55] satoshi's writings or the writings of
[69:57] people that were around when Satoshi was
[69:59] first kind of public you start to
[70:01] realize that you can actually start
[70:03] making a lot of connections between
[70:05] people and the names of Toshi Nakamoto
[70:07] if you just go back a generation or two
[70:09] when there was a heavier not a heavier
[70:11] when there was a during World War II
[70:14] when the Japanese and US weren't
[70:16] necessarily getting along if you were
[70:17] Japanese on the mainland on the US
[70:19] Mainland or in Hawaii you were
[70:21] subjugated to various things and part of
[70:23] that subjugation was they would record
[70:24] your name and so you start finding a lot
[70:26] of Satoshi Nakamoto stuff back during
[70:28] the era of World War II in the United
[70:30] States it's a weird thing that my wife
[70:32] found there
[70:34] well she does a lot of it she does like
[70:36] she does genealogy all the time she'll
[70:38] just randomly like oh I wonder where
[70:40] that person's from and then she'll just
[70:42] Off to the Races for a
[70:44] month it's uh I in my Beginnings when I
[70:49] discover Bitcoin I read about uh satosh
[70:52] nakoto his his might be stories like
[70:56] there's a whole book about where who is
[70:59] s Nakamoto who could it be and there's
[71:02] so many different stories and there my
[71:04] takeaway was like there are too many
[71:07] great stories that uh it's almost
[71:10] impossible to figure the real one or
[71:13] maybe the real one is not even there and
[71:15] I feel like it's a great thing that s
[71:17] Nakamoto is not known yeah I do too it's
[71:20] the Immaculate Conception it it adds to
[71:22] it yeah it's like the Jesus story if
[71:25] Jesus was just a dude who like showed up
[71:28] in Bethlehem at like the age of you know
[71:30] 20 it was like hey I got some stuff to
[71:32] tell y'all people probably wouldn't
[71:33] listen to him but because his story
[71:35] originates from a virgin birth and
[71:36] Immaculate Conception people are like
[71:38] hang on a second like you don't have a
[71:40] daddy you did what your daddy lives your
[71:42] daddy's what so when you talk about
[71:44] Bitcoin people say just in my last
[71:46] podcast the guy was like oh Bitcoin was
[71:48] created in the United States and I'm
[71:49] very Pro us I was like no like we don't
[71:51] know where it was created the guy's
[71:52] named Satoshi Nakamoto but he used the
[71:54] British newspaper in the first block as
[71:56] a headline like we don't know where he's
[71:58] from or you know if he was us if he was
[72:00] born in uh anywhere that you know we've
[72:03] even referenced but the fact that we
[72:05] don't know that is that Immaculate
[72:06] Conception story it's a similar
[72:09] storyline to Jesus it is to the right
[72:11] yeah it makes it's a
[72:13] mystery amazing I love the podcast with
[72:16] two the two of you um where can people
[72:20] when they want to listen to you or ask
[72:22] you questions or get in touch with you
[72:24] where can people find you
[72:25] so we have the uh podcast we've done
[72:28] four episodes uh we're planning the next
[72:30] couple the first three were really less
[72:32] learning the last one was also a
[72:34] learning experience but uh it was our
[72:36] first politician so that that had kind
[72:39] of a double-edged sword where we were
[72:41] interviewing a politician for the first
[72:42] time and we were still working on sound
[72:44] and things like that but we can find
