[00:00] the machine economy has certain needs
[00:02] and those needs aren't being met very
[00:04] well by traditional payment system
[00:06] Bitcoin is our greatest hope for a
[00:08] peaceful transition away from Dollar
[00:10] hegemony or change of the global Reserve
[00:12] currency lightning helps accelerate
[00:14] Bitcoin transactions it makes the
[00:16] transactions happen faster at lower cost
[00:19] now you've got an asset that is
[00:20] productive that does serve a function
[00:23] that is outside of Simply a store of
[00:25] value you're providing infrastructure as
[00:27] the US is considering a strategic
[00:30] Bitcoin Reserve they could actually
[00:32] provide the financial rails of the
[00:33] future and move away from an Antiquated
[00:36] Swift system we all say that has no
[00:38] second best to bitcoin it's the second
[00:39] best to lightning lightning is the only
[00:41] scaling technology that really decouples
[00:44] Bitcoin payments from having to pay for
[00:46] proof of work we're not used to a system
[00:49] where you would get paid every minute
[00:51] but that is what is possible we are
[00:53] entering a Gold Rush era for empowering
[00:56] the individual and fulfilling that
[00:58] sovereign individual vision we've got
[01:00] over $100,000 that Bitcoin is clearly
[01:02] winning and its rise has been unmatched
[01:05] by any other
[01:06] [Music]
[01:10] asset preparing Bitcoin to be the
[01:13] foundation of the machine economy is
[01:15] probably going to be something that I
[01:17] would love to talk about and go to more
[01:20] dep oh I love machine economy I think I
[01:23] never heard that word but it's I I know
[01:26] what you mean with that and I think that
[01:28] hits it really home like I love that
[01:29] word machine economy good yeah nice it
[01:34] took us a while to land on that because
[01:36] we were talking about AI to AI payments
[01:39] but that it doesn't sound as nice yeah
[01:42] and it's always it's it's it's a weird
[01:44] thing to say like AI is paying AI it
[01:47] sounds abstract but if you say like
[01:50] machine economy it's it it sounds it
[01:53] sounds profound like it sounds like
[01:55] really good um how do what is machine
[01:58] economy and and how did you land on on
[02:00] on that word and then what what does it
[02:02] mean for you yeah the the machine
[02:05] economy means that we're kind of
[02:08] progressing forward in uh in our in our
[02:13] economy just moving forward as a society
[02:16] uh being able to to pay uh to pay
[02:19] machines to to do work for us and also
[02:22] to be paid uh so I mean transactions are
[02:25] going to go back and forth um and the
[02:30] what's key in this piece is that the
[02:33] payments are going to move um a lot
[02:35] faster uh like the machine economy has
[02:39] has certain
[02:40] needs um and those those needs aren't
[02:45] aren't being met very well by
[02:47] traditional Payment Systems um so what
[02:51] we've been looking into recently is you
[02:53] know paying for uh paying for API calls
[02:58] um and being able to source
[03:00] expert uh expert data and expert uh
[03:03] algorithms in order to provide for needs
[03:07] um for example um let's see chat gbt
[03:10] went went down the other day and uh I
[03:13] had to resolve to using uh other AI
[03:17] systems and thankfully there was a paper
[03:20] query or PPQ doai which allowed me to
[03:25] pay using lightning in order to you know
[03:28] make make calls to different generative
[03:32] AI systems
[03:34] we I just have that thing where like
[03:37] when uh jbd is down it's like my my work
[03:40] is stuck it's funny how like one one
[03:44] year ago one and a half I would say now
[03:46] actually one and a half years ago um I
[03:49] didn't use it a lot and now I'm already
[03:52] so so reliant on those tools where I'm
[03:56] like if if it if it it's down I I cannot
[04:00] do a lot of work like I I use CHD for
[04:03] almost the whole podcast process from
[04:05] like starting to end uh there's always
[04:07] like some AI component to it that makes
[04:10] things easier um I got really hooked
[04:14] with that and outside of looking for the
[04:17] way uh or like for pictures even
[04:20] pictures um I don't use Google that much
[04:23] anymore I I use it for Google Docs and
[04:25] and things that I got used to but like
[04:28] actually Googling things like searching
[04:31] for things like I I I rarely do that
[04:34] these days it got really quick to
[04:37] Judd yeah it was uh it's a good
[04:40] indicator that just how big of a change
[04:43] to our society um and to our economy it
[04:47] means um it it means I think like Jeff
[04:50] boo did um kind of an interesting dive
[04:53] on you producing uh a short video and he
[04:57] had uh he had AI script it um the the
[05:01] video was produced by Ai and then the
[05:05] the voiceover narration was was all Ai
[05:08] and you know it it was quite good um and
[05:13] he could do it in about an afternoon
[05:17] whereas uh like previous to that it
[05:20] would have been like a month and like
[05:22] hiring an entire team to do that uh so
[05:26] it is like quite quite deflationary is
[05:28] is where he was he was headed with uh
[05:31] making that point but also it's just um
[05:34] it helps us be so much more productive
[05:36] than
[05:38] otherwise uh so like overall it helps
[05:42] helps uh economies be be more efficient
[05:45] um and being able to actually like make
[05:48] make payments for those for those
[05:49] individual pieces is is critical to that
[05:54] it's also interesting how AI could um
[05:59] prolong the life of feat to a certain
[06:02] extent because you have that big
[06:04] deflationary force and then all of the
[06:07] sudden the inflationary force of fear is
[06:11] less of a problem or like a problem
[06:14] that's coming at a later time and the
[06:17] pain G of gets down with deflationary
[06:19] force of Technology uh I I could imagine
[06:23] uh would be interesting also what what
[06:25] Jeff bu says to that but could imagine
[06:27] that eii could lead to feared getting a
[06:31] more one more
[06:34] exhale oh yeah uh actually uh you know
[06:37] me personally I'm uh kind of a
[06:39] subscriber to the dollar milkshake
[06:41] Theory um because there's so much US
[06:44] debt out there uh far more debt than
[06:46] there are dollars um and you've got
[06:49] deflationary forces so it could actually
[06:51] be that the the dollar becomes extremely
[06:54] strong and that is how uh Global Reserve
[06:57] currencies have died in the past um
[07:00] through deflation um usually like in the
[07:04] past for Global Reserve currencies they
[07:06] ran out of coinage and it it uh it was
[07:09] like a failure of the divisibility of
[07:11] the currency but Bitcoin doesn't have
[07:14] you know that that issue um well I mean
[07:18] and if it does uh well we've we can make
[07:21] changes uh to the protocol to to allow
[07:25] like further you know dis discritization
[07:27] of the currency absolutely just um
[07:31] quickly for the people that don't know
[07:33] about it what is the dollar milkshake
[07:35] Theory and and and why do you think it
[07:38] is why do you think it it uh carries
[07:41] weight uh yeah it's like this idea that
[07:45] kind of uh it's referencing they will be
[07:47] blood uh There Will Be Blood um and it's
[07:52] essentially about the the dollar the US
[07:55] dollar kind of sucking up Global
[07:57] liquidity um from from other economies
[08:01] you know because because the because the
[08:04] dollar has that brand recognition and it
[08:07] is uh as as uh Greg Foss says the
[08:12] fastest horse in the glue factory um
[08:15] it's it's basically it's it's still
[08:17] appealing to actually hold dollars for
[08:20] for most of the world and and that's
[08:22] kind of what we're seeing with with
[08:24] tether for example where um you know
[08:28] like it's it's such an important
[08:30] technology for the rest of the world
[08:33] um that and it already has that brand
[08:36] recognition so so people are moving to
[08:38] Stables they're moving to Dollars um but
[08:41] there aren't enough dollars in existence
[08:43] um and kind of when that when that
[08:46] happens when other currencies fail I
[08:48] mean there's there's kind of a rush to
[08:50] the dollar um but they they're going to
[08:54] have to massively offset that uh by
[08:58] printing additional currency
[09:00] making additional currency but the way
[09:01] that they do that is by issuing debt and
[09:04] so the problem gets worse not not better
[09:06] um and when there are defaults on that
[09:09] debt then it that actually reduces the
[09:12] supply of dollars which um it kind of
[09:16] snowballs into a really really bad
[09:19] situation where like
[09:22] essentially what breaks is trust in
[09:25] other people because like you
[09:29] you can't rely on them to actually
[09:31] settle their debts uh because there
[09:33] simply Aren't Enough units of the
[09:35] currency in existence to actually make
[09:37] that possible and so no one is
[09:40] creditworthy um and so that's critical
[09:43] that we need to move away from that
[09:44] system to actually have a non debt-based
[09:47] system which is
[09:50] Bitcoin it's almost almost it almost
[09:53] feels like we we could end up in kind of
[09:56] a civil war
[09:57] situation um if if there that all kind
[10:00] of comes together and and it explodes in
[10:03] our in our hands I I still like I have a
[10:06] lot of Hope and I think we we kind of
[10:09] have this peaceful Revolution and and
[10:11] kind of peaceful adopt Bitcoin um but
[10:14] there is an argument to me made that
[10:16] it's not peaceful and that we have that
[10:18] bad outcome I I think it's it's a
[10:22] realistic position to have that you know
[10:25] typically when Global Reserve currencies
[10:27] change uh it it is like a very bloody
[10:31] transition and I think Bitcoin is our
[10:34] greatest hope for a peaceful transition
[10:37] uh away from uh dollar hegemony or or
[10:41] change of the global Reserve
[10:43] currency absolutely really cool um it's
[10:46] also interesting how we look all at the
[10:48] US Bitcoin US dollar price um nobody
[10:51] cares that we broke the 100k like few
[10:55] weeks before the US dollar price in
[10:57] Canadian dollars in Australian dollars
[10:59] like nobody cares about those numbers
[11:01] but once we hit the 100K in US Dollars
[11:04] even though it's just an arbitrary
[11:06] number which we already hit in so many
[11:09] other currencies uh not a lot of
[11:12] currencies left that we didn't hit it uh
[11:15] so it's interesting how the US dollar is
[11:17] this this kind of end boss it's it's all
[11:20] like the Bitcoin Community
[11:21] recognizes uh it's about the US dollar
[11:24] because all other fear and currencies
[11:26] kind of will just fall into the US
[11:28] dollar eventually um and uh it they they
[11:32] don't they don't matter but we give a
[11:35] lot of weight to the US dollar we give a
[11:37] lot of um um yeah heaviness to the US
[11:41] dollar which which is super interesting
[11:43] do you have like um I mean that's the
[11:45] the most difficult thing to answer but
[11:47] do you have a theory of how this will
[11:50] play out and and kind of like uh think
[11:52] like what could trigger uh other
[11:55] currencies to collapse in the US dollar
[11:57] and maybe the the the dollar then also
[12:00] uh derail into Bitcoin uh do you have
[12:03] some some like okay those events has to
[12:05] happen more like that that kind of uh
[12:07] how how do you imagine that it's I it's
[12:10] it's a huge question um and there's a
[12:12] lot of factors at play I think we're in
[12:14] a a time of incredible flux uh with with
[12:19] Trump you know ascending to the Pres
[12:22] presidency um I think there's a lot of
[12:25] uncertainty on that front um and now the
[12:29] Overton window has shifted and people
[12:31] are talking about strategic Bitcoin
[12:34] Reserve um in in complete seriousness um
[12:38] you know Bitcoin is being talked about
[12:39] on mainstream news I mean we have sadine
[12:42] amus on CNBC the other day um and so
[12:46] that's like a a huge indicator that um
[12:49] you know Bitcoin is part of the global
[12:51] dialogue and it's it's continuing this
[12:55] momentum we're still early in this in
[12:57] this cycle and but it it's it's good to
[13:00] see that the that the US is becoming a
[13:03] lot more friendly to to the Bitcoin
[13:06] ecosystem so it's it's a good thing to
[13:09] see um I think uh it's it's very
[13:13] possible that it's not the US dollar
[13:15] versus Bitcoin um th those two may
[13:18] actually grow together um and like for
[13:23] for quite a while before you know one
[13:25] one takes over and I I think that's
[13:27] going to be Bitcoin absolutely
[13:29] absolutely it's it's a it's a long time
[13:31] mod uh but back to the topic of of AI
[13:34] which is super interesting you had some
[13:36] recent announcement uh with Magma I
[13:39] think it's it's called uh what did you
[13:41] do with lightning and Ai and and
[13:44] magma yeah so we've been working on the
[13:47] lighting Network for a very long time
[13:50] and uh so now we've been running amboss
[13:54] for about four years now and and
[13:57] actually creating that infrastructure
[14:00] but in order to help scale Bitcoin for
[14:02] payments for the
[14:04] globe but what has been lacking in that
[14:08] space is actually some intelligence to
[14:12] actually make make smart decisions about
[14:15] how to allocate capital and how to use
[14:17] the lightning Network in a great way so
[14:20] we put together a team of machine
[14:24] learning engineers in order to develop
[14:27] an AI system that can optimize how
[14:30] you're allocating your Bitcoin on the
[14:32] lightning Network because when people
[14:34] join Lightning they typically ask who do
[14:37] I connect to and how do I set my fees
[14:39] like those are the two major questions
[14:42] and who who to connect to like you have
[14:46] you have an option in a set of
[14:49] 15,000 so make the best decision out of
[14:52] 15,000 um without knowing anything and
[14:55] that's like the first task that you're
[14:56] given um as a lightning node op operator
[14:59] and that's way Beyond most people um I
[15:02] think a lot of people just want you know
[15:06] Bitcoin to succeed and they know
[15:08] lightning is critical to its success uh
[15:11] to scale for Global
[15:13] Payments and so we developed magma AI to
[15:18] just take just ask the question how much
[15:22] Bitcoin would you like to allocate on
[15:23] the lightning Network and now it will
[15:26] optimize the connections that you should
[15:29] make in order to have very reliable
[15:32] payments and uh like reduce transaction
[15:35] failures um keep keep low cost but
[15:38] overall um now it's now it's a solved
[15:42] problem uh so that we have a A system
[15:45] that can optimize we actually launched
[15:48] it with two different modes which is
[15:50] altruistic and then
[15:53] optimize so in the altruistic mode um
[15:56] especially after you know l Salvador
[15:59] announced that uh Bitcoin would be legal
[16:02] tender I think there was a panic in the
[16:04] Bitcoin space realizing that lightning
[16:07] was too small or uh was not prepared to
[16:11] actually or Bitcoin was not prepared to
[16:14] actually Serve the People of El Salvador
[16:17] uh because transaction costs are too
[16:19] high and they're too slow so if you're
[16:23] requiring all businesses to accept
[16:25] Bitcoin then how are you going to scale
[16:27] it and
[16:29] like the the best solution or the best
[16:32] technology out there for that uh es
[16:36] especially at that time was lightning it
[16:39] was really the only solution out there
[16:41] that was
[16:42] working now there was this huge desire
[16:46] within the Bitcoin Community to help the
[16:48] lightning Network succeed and uh scale
[16:51] and help El Salvador succeed and scale
[16:55] uh with their Bitcoin adoption so there
[16:59] was this altruistic drive to help the
[17:01] lightning network but lightning is very
[17:05] complex and it's difficult to actually
[17:08] know how to make good decisions on the
[17:10] lightning Network because it is so
[17:13] complicated and it does take a long time
[17:15] to learn but with with Magma AI now
[17:18] we're cutting that that time cutting
[17:21] that learning curve and making it a lot
[17:24] more attractive a lot more accessible uh
[17:28] to people that actually want to help the
[17:29] lightning Network so with this like
[17:32] altruistic mode you'll actually be able
[17:35] to allocate to help the lightning
[17:36] Network have you know more reliable
[17:39] payments across all sizes across the
[17:42] entire
[17:43] network so there like two modes the one
[17:45] mode where uh I get the most on the
[17:48] other mode is where the lightning
[17:50] network uh gets the most if I understood
[17:52] that correct yeah exactly so for the
[17:55] businesses that are operating out there
[17:57] so say for example bit wage wants to
[18:00] send payments anywhere in the lightning
[18:02] Network to to do payroll they're limited
[18:05] by the capacity of the lightning Network
[18:08] in a lot of these routes but if they
[18:10] want to reach anywhere in the lightning
[18:12] Network they need an optimization
[18:15] algorithm to actually be sure that they
[18:18] can process payroll amounts um over the
[18:22] lightning Network which I mean those are
[18:25] huge payments so the lightning network
[18:27] has a lot of growing to do so for them I
[18:30] would recommend using the optimized mode
[18:33] which gives them allocations to actually
[18:37] improve the the sizes of payments that
[18:39] they as an individual node would be able
[18:41] to send to the rest of the
[18:43] world so uh just for people that maybe
[18:46] don't know about the lightning Network
[18:47] too much um who is using that like if if
[18:50] you have like a your own
[18:52] wallet I mean it's if it's custodial you
[18:55] you don't have a lot of choices anyways
[18:57] uh but you have a lightning node or you
[19:00] have a self custodial wallet uh who is
[19:02] using that and and what what kind of use
[19:04] cases are there uh we're seeing more use
[19:06] cases pop up I think we've been used to
[19:10] uh transactions moving very slowly um
[19:12] but I think you know lightning helps
[19:14] accelerate Bitcoin transactions it makes
[19:17] the transactions happen faster um at
[19:20] lower cost so overall that's that's what
[19:25] lightning delivers you know for Bitcoin
[19:27] as for who's using it we've seen it
[19:29] adopted by most of the major exchanges
[19:32] so coinbase binance bitfinex um were all
[19:37] early adopters for the consumers that
[19:40] are like using using wallets um there
[19:43] are custodial and self- custody options
[19:47] so on the self- custody side uh is you
[19:51] know Breeze Phoenix um and those are
[19:54] available for consumers on the custodial
[19:57] side you
[19:59] you'll likely have the best user
[20:00] experience using custody except uh when
[20:04] those custodians fail um so it you'll be
[20:08] a great time until it no longer works um
[20:12] because you're you're putting funds at
[20:13] risk when you use a custodial option um
[20:17] but there are established players so
[20:19] wallet of Satoshi functions for most of
[20:21] the world except for the US um and also
[20:25] zbd um that is a custodial provider that
[20:29] does serve the us but that's very much
[20:31] focused on gaming so the like an in-game
[20:35] currency that should be Bitcoin and zbd
[20:39] has you know taken the move to to
[20:41] actually use that but each of these
[20:43] entities actually runs their own node on
[20:45] the lighting Network and it's all part
[20:47] of the same system so while there's many
[20:50] many providers and you know many many
[20:53] users of the lighning network they're
[20:56] all operating on the same network just
[20:58] like like you know you or I are
[21:00] accessing the internet and we're finding
[21:02] a place to plug in it's interesting when
[21:04] we talk about self custody and I just
[21:06] realized that I promote a lot of self
[21:09] custody but when we promote that is it's
[21:12] only always about Bitcoin self- custody
[21:16] and never about the second layer of
[21:18] self- custody uh I mean it's probably
[21:21] way more important on bitcoin than on
[21:23] Lightning because there are probably
[21:25] more funds uh on uh on on personal side
[21:29] that on bitcoin and on Lightning uh like
[21:31] let's say like you have 0.4 Bitcoin on
[21:34] like your self custody Bitcoin setup and
[21:36] then
[21:37] 0.001 or
[21:39] 0.01 uh uh Bitcoin on on your lightning
[21:42] uh wallet uh and and there some some
[21:45] toes obviously there's a a weight
[21:48] distribution of what is more important
[21:50] to uh defend but why is self- custody um
[21:57] especially if you have like a a small
[21:59] amount of of uh money only there still
[22:03] very important from like a
[22:06] um uh egoistical like from an eye
[22:10] perspective uh I think from the the
[22:13] network perspective it's really
[22:14] important otherwise we we kind of end up
[22:16] to the same system uh we we kind of end
[22:19] up to like a fat system again could be
[22:22] the the danger how do you see how do you
[22:24] see that yeah this this might I might be
[22:26] taking a different tack than most
[22:28] bitcoiners but uh just following that
[22:31] that progression of taking the orange
[22:33] pill and you know first first Bitcoin is
[22:37] attractive because it's you know
[22:38] volatile and so you're you want to get
[22:40] some and you want to get rich um and you
[22:44] want to like join the party and like the
[22:46] way that people do that is usually using
[22:48] the easiest method to go about that and
[22:51] so they're going to start with custody
[22:52] custody options they're going going to
[22:54] start with an exchange
[22:56] likely but it's really important to
[23:00] continue and as this you know technology
[23:03] becomes very rewarding for people you
[23:05] know financially like as that price
[23:08] ascends that's where you should take a
[23:11] lot more thought into what it was that
[23:13] you actually purchased and learn more
[23:15] about it and and take more actions to
[23:18] secure that Bitcoin and so that's where
[23:21] moving into self- custody and doing so
[23:25] quickly is is advantageous but uh
[23:28] granted that you know the Bitcoin uh
[23:31] it's harder to accumulate Bitcoin uh as
[23:34] the price goes up um it's becoming
[23:37] accessible uh for self- custody for for
[23:40] fewer people but what is uh something to
[23:45] take in into account is you know those
[23:48] that have Bitcoin and are holding it in
[23:52] self
[23:53] custody with the lightning Network now
[23:55] you
[23:56] become the provider of the the rails of
[24:00] payments so now you've got an asset that
[24:03] is productive that does serve a function
[24:06] that is outside of Simply a store of
[24:09] value U you're providing
[24:12] infrastructure so like as the US is
[24:15] considering a strategic Bitcoin Reserve
[24:17] I think what's not being talked about is
[24:21] is that they could actually provide the
[24:23] financial rails of the future and move
[24:26] away from an Antiquated Swift system
[24:29] which is uh not Swift especially
[24:32] compared to the lightning Network that
[24:34] can process nearly instant
[24:37] transactions super it's also interesting
[24:40] uh as you just mentioned uh people are
[24:42] getting priced out slowly slowly already
[24:45] of the main layer um and we're just at
[24:47] the starting we're just like really
[24:49] early in the in the Bitcoin uh Journey
[24:52] um thinking that through over the next
[24:55] five 10 20 years uh it it could end up
[24:59] where the lightning network uh or other
[25:02] second layer Solutions uh are the kind
[25:05] of the main layer where not the most
[25:08] Bitcoin are but the most people are uh
[25:11] with with the Bitcoin uh could could be
[25:13] an interesting uh thing where the the
[25:17] main layers all of the sudden only for
[25:19] ogs
[25:21] banks um big corporations uh High native
[25:26] individuals uh or just really early
[25:28] people Everyone that is listening
[25:30] probably here uh so is that kind of the
[25:34] the future where we're going is the the
[25:36] the the main layer for the the heavy
[25:38] stuff and then we have like a second
[25:40] layer uh with lightning that is then
[25:43] more for the everyday stuff and then
[25:45] there's probably something above that
[25:47] even yeah as we're as like as the
[25:51] economy moves faster like a lot of that
[25:54] does need to go on Lightning you know
[25:56] for I mean as we're talking about this
[25:58] like shift in the economy towards AI you
[26:01] know those are going to be small micro
[26:03] payments and what we saw with our our
[26:06] research um I published a piece called
[26:10] the the metric that matters talking
[26:11] about Max flow and it was actually about
[26:16] how the lightning network is really
[26:17] optimized for for very small payments
[26:20] and as the Bitcoin price goes up what
[26:23] we're considering a micro payment
[26:25] actually grows um so it can be the
[26:29] day-to-day payments so as as Bitcoin you
[26:33] know becomes more valuable and now it's
[26:35] reached 100,000 now we were we were
[26:38] running this in simulation to actually
[26:40] see what size payments could the
[26:43] lightning Network process and you know
[26:45] in our Ascension from $50,000 Bitcoin to
[26:49] $100,000 Bitcoin our ability to do a
[26:52] $100 payment on the lighting
[26:56] Network its success rate went from from
[26:59] 55% chance of success to
[27:03] 72% um so it has you know significantly
[27:07] jumped up and that's really based on the
[27:10] price change uh and the lightning
[27:13] Network itself doesn't need to grow it
[27:16] doesn't necessarily need more Bitcoin um
[27:19] but the the change in price of the asset
[27:22] uh does really affect how how useful uh
[27:26] the lightning network is so you may not
[27:28] need to have very much Bitcoin in the
[27:30] liting network but it becomes useful for
[27:33] more and more people so they will be
[27:36] operating on like a lightning first
[27:39] basis um and that's that's where folks
[27:42] will will transact what why is that I'm
[27:45] I'm not technical so why is the higher
[27:49] price of that ensuring that the lighting
[27:52] transaction is failing
[27:54] less yeah so a a million sat channel is
[28:00] uh a million Satoshi or 01 Bitcoin you
[28:04] can make a channel a lightning Channel
[28:07] with that so if the Bitcoin price is
[28:10] $50,000 then you can make a 50 uh sorry
[28:14] a $500 payment in that channel but as
[28:18] the price Rises to
[28:21] $100,000 you're able to make a $1,000
[28:24] payment in the 1 million sat channel so
[28:27] the infrastructure
[28:28] for payments doesn't change but you know
[28:32] the the actual amount of Satoshi that
[28:34] move to settle that larger payment it
[28:38] becomes smaller and smaller well yes
[28:39] because uh then the we we we need to
[28:42] move less Sates for the same dollar
[28:45] price exactly that makes that makes a
[28:48] lot of sense so yeah the the the
[28:51] lighting network is now like casting a
[28:53] bigger net of what portion of the
[28:55] economy it can
[28:56] serve that's
[28:58] uh does lightning still like it's it's
[29:03] obviously there has to be developments
[29:04] like neither I think neither Bitcoin nor
[29:07] lightning would survive if we completely
[29:11] stop doing anything on that but like
[29:14] what are the the the Bigg limits that
[29:16] you right now see or the adoption
[29:18] barriers that you see where we kind of
[29:20] have to overcome them yeah I I think the
[29:23] biggest one is really about uh user
[29:26] experience and uh part of that is is
[29:29] just overall payment success um and
[29:32] being able to process payments um let's
[29:36] see so at amboss we're focused more on
[29:39] the application layer so there's a
[29:41] there's a couple of pieces that are
[29:43] missing that we we saw one is just you
[29:46] know Market coordination you know
[29:48] because of all of the private uh or the
[29:52] the decisions that were made in the
[29:54] design of a lightning Network protocol
[29:56] it was very privacy first
[29:58] which is awesome but it comes at odds
[30:02] with coordination for like efficient use
[30:06] and that results in sometimes failed
[30:09] payments so like because of that you
[30:12] need like additional intelligence and
[30:15] additional data um so people can
[30:18] collaborate to have you know a better
[30:20] outcome so Renee Peart wrote a paper
[30:23] called the price of Anarchy and that was
[30:27] that was really
[30:28] uh I would say that's a landmark paper
[30:31] because it's showing that if people are
[30:33] choosing privacy uh like completely and
[30:38] don't share any information then there
[30:41] is a a consequence in the efficiency of
[30:44] the of the outcome so say for example
[30:47] you know you're using Google Maps uh to
[30:50] get to your
[30:52] destination but now you don't know any
[30:55] traffic
[30:56] information uh because no one else is
[30:59] using that same app so you you'll you'll
[31:05] get to your destination faster if other
[31:08] people actually share information about
[31:11] you know the the traffic situation that
[31:13] they're in so like ways for example
[31:16] would help people avoid um you know
[31:19] obstacles in the road because people are
[31:22] sharing additional information and the
[31:24] same is true for lightning or you can
[31:26] have greater payment success
[31:28] if PE if we know some information about
[31:31] how to get to the destination because it
[31:33] it is a very similar routing problem I
[31:36] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[31:40] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[31:43] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[31:46] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[31:48] vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin watch
[31:52] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[31:55] go out there and show that you are a
[31:57] Bitcoin and that watch brand is Bitcoin
[32:00] only and coin vigilante just dropped a
[32:03] completely new and amazing Genesis
[32:06] edition of their watch collections you
[32:09] have the date of the first ever mined
[32:12] Bitcoin Block in there and of course
[32:15] also the block height and which EPO we
[32:18] are currently in I love the level of
[32:20] detail they put in in this masterpiece
[32:23] and make sure to check out those amazing
[32:26] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[32:29] descriptions I love those watches so so
[32:32] much if you watch or listen to my
[32:35] podcast on a regular basis I'll guess
[32:37] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[32:39] the most important step is to keep the
[32:42] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[32:45] wallet my personal recommendation for
[32:47] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[32:50] secure it's simple to set up it's also
[32:52] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[32:54] the Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[32:57] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[33:01] the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss
[33:05] robobin to get your bitbox and the next
[33:07] step is to really level up your
[33:09] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[33:12] have the most secure self custody setup
[33:15] you have to secure your own devices you
[33:18] have to protect your privacy you have to
[33:20] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[33:23] on where you live you even want to have
[33:26] a plan B a citizens ship where you can
[33:28] move in case something goes really
[33:30] really wrong and through all those steps
[33:32] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[33:35] step by step and if you visit the
[33:38] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[33:41] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[33:44] out how you can level up your
[33:47] sovereignty interesting yeah because you
[33:49] you still have to to to get fruit the
[33:52] channels to the end destination and
[33:54] there has to be some way and it's it's
[33:55] similar than a than a map um interesting
[33:59] do do you we all say there's no second
[34:02] best to bitcoin is the second best to
[34:04] lightning
[34:06] um let's see uh I would position
[34:09] lighning as really the connective tissue
[34:12] um so with I mean it's connecting
[34:15] Bitcoin it's it's also showing that it
[34:18] is critical infrastructure for Arc which
[34:21] is another second layer on the utxo
[34:23] sharing model um we're also seeing other
[34:27] developments on uh you know so-called
[34:29] layer twos uh that all have lightning on
[34:33] the road map so like it is critical
[34:36] infrastructure um for those folks
[34:40] um and yeah I I think that's important
[34:44] uh I don't need to be the the Michael
[34:46] sailor of lightning and say that there
[34:48] is no second best um but uh overall you
[34:52] know lightning lightning is
[34:54] critical yeah it seems like um if if you
[34:58] talk about with anyone about scaling
[35:02] Bitcoin um in every situation and every
[35:07] conversation there's lightning coming up
[35:09] so it seems to be like even if people
[35:12] try to do something else they're like
[35:14] there's a lightning component to it
[35:16] there's something it's it's almost it's
[35:19] almost like Bitcoin for for the the base
[35:22] layer where you just can not talk about
[35:25] Bitcoin where like that's that's that's
[35:27] the main asset once you understand it uh
[35:30] and uh but but it's it seems like
[35:33] lightning is kind of the the winner
[35:35] there and then never use something else
[35:37] except lightning uh for for payments uh
[35:41] and if you go to conferences or go to
[35:43] meetups where something is paying is
[35:45] like I do you pay on chain which is kind
[35:49] of absurd because you you you you you
[35:52] pay more in fees sometimes than you pay
[35:55] for the actual thing depending on on
[35:57] kind of what fee season we are currently
[35:59] in uh but yeah you always pain lighting
[36:02] so it almost it has that Network effect
[36:06] where we want to make lightning now work
[36:10] even it has some challenges uh we we we
[36:13] want to develop on that rather than
[36:15] starting a whole new thing which would
[36:17] bring a lot more problems uh uh to it
[36:21] and that's a great thing with software
[36:23] right you can you can change it around
[36:25] if there's something if fundamentally
[36:28] it's a good idea it's it it should be
[36:31] pursued uh at least as I I see but it's
[36:34] really hard for me to talk about that
[36:35] because I'm so bad with technology on
[36:38] top of
[36:40] Bitcoin um there was like one really
[36:43] good framing that I heard about this is
[36:45] that you know lightning is the only
[36:47] scaling technology that really decouples
[36:51] Bitcoin from having or Bitcoin payments
[36:54] from having to pay for proof of work and
[36:57] I think proof of work is like this
[36:59] essential technology uh for Bitcoin to
[37:02] have it be this very neutral system but
[37:06] when you're creating a payment channel
[37:08] the individual payments on Lightning
[37:10] don't have to pay for the proof of work
[37:12] because they're using digital signatures
[37:14] from you know two parties which is about
[37:16] as simple as you can get so that change
[37:20] just makes it you know a database update
[37:23] for two people or you're having like a a
[37:27] mutually signed transaction um that is
[37:30] that is now updated so that way the
[37:34] actual scaling of payments for Bitcoin
[37:37] becomes unbounded like there's no limit
[37:40] to the amount of transactions that you
[37:41] can do because Bitcoin has lightning
[37:44] absolutely it's it's the only way to to
[37:47] do exactly what you described without
[37:49] using a completely centralized system
[37:52] because like you can also transact
[37:55] probably from one Exchange
[37:58] uh to another user on the same exchange
[38:00] some Bitcoin and it's just a database
[38:02] entry but that that's not that's not the
[38:07] end goal of it it's the only way to do
[38:09] exactly that with being connected to the
[38:11] actual Bitcoin layer yeah like even
[38:14] Solana for example as like a blockchain
[38:17] that made all of the decisions to be as
[38:19] centralized as possible to scale for
[38:22] transactions each of those transactions
[38:25] actually reached 5 cents per transaction
[38:27] which is simply too expensive if you're
[38:30] talking about the scale of HTTP requests
[38:33] or bits moving on the internet like you
[38:36] you need to reach way higher scale than
[38:40] what what salana is achieving even with
[38:43] their uh all of the centralized
[38:45] decisions that they're
[38:47] making it it seems really like out uh
[38:50] the the lightning Network made the
[38:53] altcoin crowd
[38:55] really mad even the certain extent
[38:58] because it's always like oh Bitcoin
[39:00] doesn't scale and don't talk about
[39:03] lightning I like the the amount of uh of
[39:07] hate that lightning gets from some of
[39:09] the some of the cryptocurrency folks is
[39:12] um a little bit it's it's unjustified um
[39:16] and I think most of them will like try
[39:18] and pull up uh metrics um well yeah we
[39:22] as bitcoiners we have to be careful
[39:24] about like what we're what we're hating
[39:25] on and identifying
[39:28] like what we're struggling with and
[39:29] areas for future development versus
[39:32] things that have failed on their
[39:33] promises and I think people have uh had
[39:37] this idea that that someone was making
[39:39] promises about uh about lightning um
[39:43] when like in reality we're talking about
[39:46] you know future you know techn
[39:48] technological developments um because
[39:51] like one of the best things about you
[39:53] know working on lightning is there's
[39:55] tons of opportunities but on the on the
[39:58] flip side of this you literally have to
[40:00] build everything in the economy uh to
[40:03] actually make this system work for real
[40:06] people and for real use cases and so
[40:10] that's that's where we're functioning
[40:11] not so much on the protocol level but
[40:13] really on the applications to solve real
[40:15] problems for real
[40:16] people yeah absolutely and it it it kind
[40:19] of shines a lot on like how how early we
[40:21] are if if you had to like made like an
[40:25] an loading uh how it call a loading bar
[40:28] from like zero to 100 and 100% would be
[40:30] like Bitcoin is ready for 8 billion
[40:33] people uh to be uh the one money that we
[40:36] all use H how far that loading bar kind
[40:40] of are we from zero to 100% I I have no
[40:44] idea um and I don't know that we'll
[40:48] we'll ever know because there there is
[40:50] no limit uh to this so and it's hard for
[40:54] us to imagine like an economy where just
[40:57] payments are flying around um like we're
[41:01] still getting paid you know maybe maybe
[41:04] weekly to every two weeks monthly um
[41:07] we're not used to a system or not even
[41:10] prepared mentally for a system where you
[41:13] would get paid in a like every minute or
[41:16] so but but that is what what is possible
[41:20] and I think that is what's necessary for
[41:23] uh like a machine economy to flourish is
[41:27] this this whole system where you know
[41:29] you're transacting back and forth um and
[41:31] it's happening very quickly yeah and I
[41:34] guess the the loading bar the 100 is
[41:36] never reached like there's always
[41:38] there's always new developments so like
[41:40] it's it's never 100% dayline it's
[41:42] finished now it's it's Infinity divided
[41:45] by 21 million as can says absolutely
[41:49] really cool um you talked about that uh
[41:53] the change like I think most people I
[41:55] don't know how it's in in America uh but
[41:57] in in Austria it's common sense to get
[42:00] paid on a monthly basis uh I know
[42:03] somewhere in the world like there's like
[42:05] maybe bi-weekly you get paid sometimes
[42:08] weekly and stuff like that but AUST only
[42:10] know it um uh on on a monthly basis now
[42:14] that I switched over to to to having my
[42:16] business it's it's kind of weird for me
[42:18] because I was till February employed and
[42:20] I got one time per month my my check but
[42:23] now it's like the payments coming like
[42:26] all over the month and there's like I
[42:27] don't know seven or eight or maybe more
[42:30] than that or over 10 times sometimes
[42:32] from different sources but smaller
[42:35] payments coming in and it's an
[42:36] interesting feeling like it changes
[42:38] something uh uh with you where you think
[42:42] less about that monthly thing um if we
[42:45] kind of get more even in that direction
[42:47] where we get even paid for small tasks
[42:50] or like for like minutes of things or
[42:53] like like really like the micro micro
[42:55] micro payments of it
[42:58] um or or like not even getting paid but
[43:01] also paying in in that where you I don't
[43:03] know have a Netflix where you pay for
[43:06] every second you watch some micro satosi
[43:08] or something else um what do you think
[43:11] will that change for the human being
[43:15] involved in that machine economy that's
[43:17] a great Point um and one thing to think
[43:22] about is like we might just have you
[43:24] know singular relationships with with
[43:27] companies that might delegate some of
[43:30] that that work of the of the actual
[43:32] transactions because because you're
[43:34] right uh if you have you know money
[43:37] flying around at the speed of the
[43:39] internet like your accounting system
[43:41] completely changes now you're thinking
[43:43] in terms of flows um and not in terms of
[43:46] individual transactions because it it's
[43:50] it's just a a complete uh mental mental
[43:53] shift so say for example if you're
[43:55] paying for your Netflix
[43:57] subscription uh Netflix is actually
[43:59] issuing payments to the entire film
[44:02] industry that backs that so each of
[44:05] these individual payments that are much
[44:06] smaller and so you know you might pay
[44:09] monthly for example to Netflix but then
[44:14] uh Netflix is actually Distributing
[44:16] funds to all of the the creators and and
[44:19] producers that that make those films
[44:22] happen uh now like when we're talking
[44:25] about lightning now maybe I can just pay
[44:28] for the actual uh amount that I'm
[44:31] watching and like and then the creators
[44:35] of these films might get better data
[44:37] about like what people are really
[44:40] enjoying H similar to what we're seeing
[44:43] with podcasting 2.0 where folks that are
[44:46] you know recording a podcast can
[44:48] actually see where these different
[44:51] boosts happen where they get additional
[44:53] payments from the listeners that really
[44:54] enjoyed something and so so that like
[44:58] having money move at the speed of the
[45:00] internet you know provides a better
[45:02] outcome for for better content to
[45:05] actually uh give additional feedback on
[45:08] on that content and get people paid uh
[45:12] often more efficiently than they
[45:14] otherwise would it's also interesting
[45:17] when you think about um the the social
[45:20] media aspect of it for example before
[45:24] social media most people listen to a
[45:25] newsman and this was a whole company was
[45:30] was big middleman in between the the
[45:33] news anchor uh versus all the people
[45:37] listening uh and now we kind of got rid
[45:40] of that whole system around the the one
[45:42] person reading the news uh and we just
[45:44] have like a podcast host that maybe has
[45:47] one employee or maybe has five employees
[45:49] maybe has 10 employees if he's really
[45:52] successful uh but you don't really need
[45:54] anything more than that to to run this
[45:57] same thing that you needed like hundreds
[45:59] of people in like a network or something
[46:01] like that so it kind of it already shows
[46:04] a little bit the trend of you the the
[46:07] connections get more direct and and less
[46:09] middleman in there so I don't know maybe
[46:12] there's like a platform maybe that just
[46:14] gets like 1% of of of a fee uh and we
[46:19] can directly pay the the film producers
[46:23] and there's not a Netflix in between
[46:24] that charges us like monthly for for
[46:27] that so I I don't know it's it's really
[46:29] interesting to think about the use cases
[46:31] of microp payments and what it does to
[46:33] our overall economy and what the the
[46:35] role of then actual peer-to-peer economy
[46:39] uh looks like I have a lot of questions
[46:42] around that uh but yeah how do you see
[46:45] that how do you think that that could
[46:48] function yeah uh like when when talking
[46:52] to like family over Thanksgiving um you
[46:56] know I'll share what I've learned about
[46:58] Bitcoin and I think a lot of the
[47:01] concerns are well there's the Bitcoin
[47:04] isn't distributed enough um you know
[47:07] there's there's only a few rich people
[47:09] that are going to get rich from Bitcoin
[47:11] I mean this is just like you know
[47:13] classic fud stuff but I think what's
[47:16] what's missing is the actual
[47:18] decentralizing effect of of Bitcoin is
[47:23] that like we're not going to have you
[47:26] know Mega Mega corporations that are
[47:29] going to disproportionately benefit uh
[47:32] what what ends up happening is that the
[47:35] the the economy shifts to be far more
[47:38] decentralized so you're going to have
[47:40] individual specialized efforts um so
[47:43] like podcast hosts that that are
[47:46] focusing deep into individual topics and
[47:50] you know you're you're going to get a
[47:52] lot more depth of information instead of
[47:55] just all of the words that you can fit
[47:57] into the news Anchor's mouth um in like
[47:59] a 1-hour segment um the barrier to entry
[48:04] for actually starting a business has has
[48:07] now dropped to near
[48:10] zero that like someone can process their
[48:13] own payments with a device that is you
[48:17] know as as inexpensive as like $300 to
[48:21] actually have their a complete uh
[48:24] payment sovereignty situation
[48:27] where they're able to accept payments
[48:29] from anywhere in the world and reach a
[48:31] global audience so like like part of the
[48:33] Innovation was like the internet but if
[48:36] we even scroll back to like the
[48:39] Gutenberg Press where like producing a
[48:43] text like a book used to be it used to
[48:47] be a significant portion of a human life
[48:50] in order to create that one object which
[48:53] was a book you know you've got educating
[48:56] describe to actually be able to to write
[48:59] and read and then you know spending
[49:01] their time actually you know
[49:03] manually um rewriting this book versus
[49:08] you know Gutenberg Press now you're able
[49:11] to lower the cost of actual publishing
[49:15] and so now at in the age of uh of
[49:18] Twitter and Noster now that that barrier
[49:21] to entry has dropped to near zero
[49:24] because people can access the internet
[49:26] and they're able to put their thoughts
[49:27] out on the internet and publish them for
[49:29] a global audience so it has you know
[49:32] dramatically shifted and now we've got a
[49:34] money system that is able to support
[49:38] that entire
[49:40] economy and make it uh so you have like
[49:43] a frictionless uh transaction system
[49:46] it's it's also it kind of takes the uh
[49:49] Power away from those big institutions
[49:52] and big corporations and big governments
[49:54] and big whatever actually uh and
[49:57] empowers the individual more if you
[50:00] think about how how what you have to do
[50:03] to uh get uh I don't know music contract
[50:06] going and a label going uh before social
[50:09] media before Bitcoin before uh that all
[50:12] happening and we are still in the in the
[50:15] middle phase where we have social
[50:17] media and we already have those small
[50:21] Technologies with Bitcoin like we have
[50:24] Nostra we have fountain we have how is
[50:28] it called wave Lake uh it's also really
[50:30] interesting uh and all those kind of
[50:33] applications to that but they're very
[50:35] knce still like they're very early on uh
[50:39] and and it feels like there there's a
[50:41] whole bunch of innovation coming the
[50:43] next like 10 20 years and we are kind of
[50:46] entering a Gold Rush era uh for
[50:49] empowering the individual and fulfilling
[50:52] that uh um how's that book called s an
[50:56] individual uh that that that kind of a
[50:59] vision do you also see it like
[51:01] that yeah I I think I mean some of the
[51:05] technological advancements that we've
[51:07] made are are really game changers for
[51:10] just the good the good of people and the
[51:13] good of individuals uh to actually have
[51:16] a lot more sovereignty and a lot more
[51:18] control over their financial lives um
[51:22] and I I love to see that you continued
[51:24] Trend um and I don't think we're far off
[51:28] because uh tether for example is
[51:31] processing more payments than Visa at
[51:34] this point and so when we look at actual
[51:38] stable coins moving over the lighting
[51:41] Network like that's possible because of
[51:43] tap rot assets and so you can actually
[51:46] have someone that is receiving you know
[51:49] dollar stable coins um over the lighting
[51:52] Network and that is a complete Game Cher
[51:55] so now you can uh you've got the brand
[51:57] recognition that resonates with a ton of
[51:59] people globally and also be able to
[52:03] settle payments um in a way that scales
[52:07] and preserves
[52:10] decentralization super interesting very
[52:12] cool um what else are you currently
[52:15] working on at ambos uh uh we talked
[52:18] about the the AI uh thing but it's a
[52:21] more recent thing like what what is what
[52:23] is OS and and what in general are you
[52:25] doing there
[52:27] yeah like in general we're providing
[52:29] intelligence you know for for payments
[52:32] on bitcoin um and especially high volume
[52:35] digital economies so that's what we're
[52:38] focused on and in order to make that
[52:40] happen you know we're putting a lot of
[52:43] resources into machine learning and
[52:45] delivering those products for people to
[52:48] actually be able to access the the
[52:51] advancements to do more automation so
[52:54] that they can access highly scalable pay
[52:57] payments so we've got quite a quite a
[53:00] bit more on that front um additionally
[53:02] like we have a magma marketplace where
[53:04] you can buy and sell lightning channels
[53:07] um and like earn start earning Bitcoin
[53:10] for providing new channels to folks and
[53:13] that solves liquidity issues um but also
[53:16] we've got ambus dospace which you know
[53:19] anybody can now get discovered on the
[53:21] lightning Network and you can see all
[53:22] the connections and be able to learn and
[53:25] and access data about um like about
[53:29] operations to
[53:31] optimize it's just a you're just trying
[53:33] to solve The World's payment uh
[53:37] problem yeah uh a big a big piece that
[53:41] we also work on is uh doing some like
[53:44] Risk Management and providing uh like
[53:47] safe rails for businesses to participate
[53:49] now I didn't really realize this um but
[53:52] as a business a lot of your work ends up
[53:55] being about compliance
[53:56] um so for those regulated institutions
[54:00] they need to establish business rules
[54:02] for themselves and so we've got a
[54:04] product that's specific for that it's
[54:06] called reflex and it allows whatever
[54:09] rules that a business has to abide by it
[54:12] will just operationalize those rules so
[54:14] that people can transact on the
[54:16] lightning Network and be able to have
[54:18] very confident uh responses when someone
[54:21] like Elizabeth Warren says oh like
[54:24] bitcoin's just used for paying terorists
[54:26] and ransomware and all of these things
[54:29] all of the fud lines um businesses need
[54:31] to have very strong answers to say we
[54:34] don't participate in that I feel like
[54:37] the fud is getting less I don't know
[54:40] maybe I'm just too deep in the Bitcoin
[54:41] bubble uh but but I I feel like the the
[54:45] for example the environment fight I
[54:46] don't hear a lot more is it's
[54:49] interesting uh how it gets less but
[54:52] maybe it's just because I talk too much
[54:53] with with
[54:55] bitcoiners yeah uh Bitcoin is going to
[54:57] need better critics um because uh all of
[55:00] the fud lines are now in danger um
[55:04] because uh we we keep uh developing this
[55:07] technology and it's not going to stop I
[55:09] mean it's it's benefit benefiting from
[55:11] all of the open source Innovation and
[55:13] we'll continue to do so and I love how
[55:16] uh the community actually reacts when
[55:18] you when you have a thing like oh
[55:20] Bitcoin is bad for the environment uh I
[55:24] I was impressed how how great the whole
[55:28] Community came together and fought back
[55:31] with data with real world examples with
[55:34] just so obvious things where you're like
[55:37] yeah like if you think Bitcoin is bad
[55:39] for an environment like like where do
[55:41] you get that from and then you research
[55:44] the articles that say that Bitcoin is
[55:45] bad for an environment and you're like
[55:47] okay there's no basis to that then you
[55:49] research like why it's not like that and
[55:51] it's like oh there just all the data all
[55:53] that research to that and there's like
[55:56] way more thingss to back those things
[55:59] like it's it's it's fascinating for me
[56:02] how deeply researched and and and and
[56:06] back this uh whole Community acts in
[56:09] those situation uh we we sometimes um
[56:13] get a criticism of being toxic and like
[56:16] being in a in a religious group um but I
[56:20] think you have to be uh when you try to
[56:25] revolutionize the monetary system if you
[56:27] try to do something that is such a big
[56:30] magnet nude it's like a early startup
[56:32] that tries to do something really big uh
[56:35] they are very religious about their
[56:37] product and services and and so is is
[56:39] Bitcoin uh so yeah I I like that we a
[56:42] little bit toxic sometimes but uh it it
[56:45] it gets better I feel like yeah I I mean
[56:48] the the Bitcoin rabbit hole is deep and
[56:51] there is complexity there um and for
[56:54] people that are willing to look look
[56:56] into it I think that we they start to
[56:59] lose their criticisms uh because like as
[57:04] they they learn more about it they start
[57:06] comparing it to existing systems and and
[57:10] in that process they might realize that
[57:13] you know Bitcoin is a much better
[57:15] technology compared to anything else in
[57:17] existence that is good for the world um
[57:20] you know orange coin good never go
[57:24] up I
[57:27] yeah the major takeaways it's uh I mean
[57:30] there are some examples in in in my
[57:33] environment where I saw people actually
[57:35] researching it and uh they they didn't
[57:38] quite get it so like they they actually
[57:40] bought some Bitcoin books and they they
[57:42] needed more time to it and and they
[57:44] needed longer for it um but I'm
[57:46] impressed with the people and I met some
[57:48] that came into Bitcoin in 2024 like they
[57:52] first got orange building this year and
[57:55] I'm impressed how quick they got into
[57:58] this whole thing uh which gives me a
[58:00] good indication of our whole education
[58:05] system around Bitcoin and the content
[58:08] variety got really good in the last few
[58:10] years because it took me a while and I
[58:13] remember talking to a lot of people and
[58:16] took them a while and it seems like the
[58:19] learning process is kind of accelerated
[58:22] now for for people getting into Bitcoin
[58:25] and it's it's like a quick way from from
[58:28] the top to the there's no bottom for to
[58:31] the rabbit hole but from the top to a a
[58:34] good good amount of the rabbit hole yeah
[58:37] yeah yeah
[58:38] abely uh yeah a lot of uh props to all
[58:42] of the content creators that are you
[58:44] know making quality pieces that actually
[58:47] help people get down get down that
[58:49] rabbit hole um you know for me it was
[58:52] like Andrea soplos recordings um and
[58:56] like someone a technologist to break
[58:58] things down for me like as as an
[59:01] engineer um and then you know safine of
[59:04] course to actually be able to uh lay out
[59:07] the economic arguments um and the the
[59:10] economic frames of thinking in order to
[59:13] deeply understand the technology but uh
[59:16] that wasn't that that didn't exist um
[59:20] you know like before really when I got
[59:22] into Bitcoin um and it's gotten a whole
[59:25] lot better and now there's podcasts
[59:27] there's content there's videos there's
[59:29] tutorials there's walkthroughs um and
[59:32] tons of discussions of you know high
[59:35] quality bitcoiners that are uh kind of
[59:37] moving the needle forward on the whole
[59:39] education
[59:40] front uh but I still feel the um how
[59:44] important do do you think still the the
[59:47] the the priz is the marketing tool
[59:49] number one is is that still the the
[59:51] thing that gets people
[59:53] in I I think so um hearing like Michael
[59:56] Sailor Talk About You Know micro
[59:58] strategies performance um is like kind
[60:01] of reinforcing that idea because you
[60:04] know his uh his earnings call is
[60:07] basically like we've won uh you know
[60:09] we're the highest performing stock um it
[60:12] shows I mean we've had this amount of
[60:14] growth and the same thing happens for
[60:16] for Bitcoin it's like well we've won
[60:19] we've got over
[60:20] $100,000 um you Bitcoin is clearly
[60:23] winning um and it's it's rise has been
[60:27] unmatched by any other asset so um here
[60:31] we are and we we we keep winning we keep
[60:35] winning we keep winning on the price
[60:38] cycle but also just on the technology
[60:41] standpoint and uh I like the meme and
[60:44] it's existed since forever I guess uh
[60:47] you you come for the prize and you stay
[60:48] for the revolution uh and it's it's very
[60:51] true you I mean maybe there are some
[60:54] people staying for the wrong reasons
[60:56] uh and they get down the rabbit hole
[60:59] later um but I feel like those people
[61:01] probably get distracted by either
[61:04] altcoin or maybe even micro strategy
[61:06] this cycle because it's going faster
[61:09] than Bitcoin might be a distraction to
[61:11] to not hold Bitcoin in self custody uh
[61:14] yeah but it's really interesting really
[61:15] cool perfect we we have one question um
[61:19] uh that I asked each guest every one of
[61:21] my guests is what can we learn from you
[61:24] besides Bitcoin uh uh you can learn uh
[61:28] from me about graph Theory and the the
[61:32] math of of networks which is uh
[61:36] fundamental to all the work that we've
[61:38] been doing on on the lighning network
[61:41] wait what what graph theory is
[61:43] statistics or what is that graph theory
[61:46] is a branch of mathematics that was
[61:49] developed for networks it started with a
[61:52] a problem called like the Seven Bridges
[61:54] problem um uh
[61:56] really invented by Oiler back in the day
[62:00] um so as a as a maatic as a mathematical
[62:04] field uh so a lot of the work that we do
[62:07] at amboss is related to graph Theory and
[62:10] graph machine learning which is super
[62:12] interesting and and math is connected
[62:15] to to everything I would say yeah as as
[62:20] my MAF teachers and professors always
[62:21] said like if you know MAF you know
[62:24] life exactly
[62:26] really cool perfect we have an ENT in
[62:28] the podcast where the previous guest is
[62:30] asking a question for the next guest
[62:32] without knowing who the next guest
[62:33] actually is and your question from the
[62:35] previous guest is what is the most
[62:37] profound experience you had with Bitcoin
[62:41] profound experience I think it was it
[62:44] was a point in my life
[62:47] where you know I went from thinking that
[62:50] Bitcoin was was interesting and uh a
[62:54] tech a tech Improvement to realizing
[62:58] that I'm more comfortable with my funds
[63:01] in Bitcoin than any of the other funds
[63:04] it was like I just took the the whole
[63:07] orange pill it was um that I feel safer
[63:11] in the Bitcoin space um and in Bitcoin
[63:15] that I do with anything else and people
[63:19] don't get that uh
[63:22] because I feel the same way and a lot of
[63:25] Bitcoin feel the same way and and and
[63:27] people ask me oh how can you sleep with
[63:29] all your money in Bitcoin and I'm like
[63:30] how can you sleep with anything in the
[63:32] field like I if I would have a
[63:35] significant amount in uh of of Euros on
[63:39] my bank account I would be like ah that
[63:41] it has to be on bitcoin like like it has
[63:43] to move some somewhere like it I don't
[63:46] want to keep it there because maybe
[63:48] tomorrow the Euro collapses I don't know
[63:50] it's not impossible I know that Bitcoin
[63:53] will be still there tomorrow so that
[63:56] that that is a profound uh profound
[63:59] Awakening Point uh for for everyone
[64:02] every bitcoiner to like oh I'm I don't
[64:05] want to hold my money there like why
[64:07] should I keep it there exactly perfect
[64:10] then uh um before I let you go where can
[64:14] people find you ask your questions maybe
[64:15] also find
[64:17] amboss yeah so they can follow amboss on
[64:21] X uh ambos Tech or you can follow me at
[64:27] jerore
[64:30] BTC perfect then thank you so much uh
[64:33] Jer for being on uh also thank you so
[64:35] much for everyone that is watching and
[64:36] listening uh for for joining us today as
[64:39] always I'll be back tomorrow with
[64:41] another episode bye-bye
