[00:00] every day more and more people come to
[00:01] bitcoin and understand that it is the
[00:03] hardest currency on the planet living on
[00:05] the Bitcoin standard is not impossible
[00:07] it just takes a little bit more effort
[00:09] it's everyone's job who already
[00:11] understands Bitcoin and the value to
[00:13] actually propose this to as many people
[00:15] as humanly possible across the planet
[00:17] the more people know about that and that
[00:19] Satoshi are actually a real number that
[00:21] you can utilize eventually one Satoshi
[00:24] will be $1 we all must own it and hold
[00:26] it and spend it and replace it as more
[00:29] and more people get orang pill we will
[00:31] grow in
[00:32] [Music]
[00:36] magnitude I haven't seen you since uh
[00:39] when we were at the Mina conference in
[00:41] Abu Dhabi oh yeah it was it was a great
[00:44] conference I feel like uh um are you
[00:47] more at conferences are are you trying
[00:49] to get to as many conferen as possible
[00:51] or why why were you there yes we're try
[00:54] we're trying to get more visibility and
[00:56] um and uh link up with the right people
[00:59] in the industry and get our name out
[01:02] there uh we actually uh we're we're
[01:04] heading to a couple this
[01:07] month oh uh El Salvador I guess is is
[01:11] one of them with the the golf tournament
[01:14] of Max Kaiser and the plan B no actually
[01:16] we're not going to that one I wish uh
[01:19] that sounded like a really good uh a
[01:21] good one in El Salvador but my golf game
[01:24] is not up to par so I will I will uh
[01:27] defer any golfing to uh probably our our
[01:31] CFL but yeah yeah I'm also not there
[01:36] because I never golfed at all like I
[01:38] I've never even I've never even touched
[01:40] this this this thing to hit the balls I
[01:42] don't know how it's
[01:44] called the sticks yes the sticks yeah
[01:48] we're actually heading to Colombia uh so
[01:51] that's happening at the end of next week
[01:54] uh to the Bitcoin Medan conference and
[01:57] uh and then my co-founder h will be at
[02:00] the Cape Town conference on January 25th
[02:03] and 26th ah yeah Andre was already on
[02:06] the podcast it was really good to talk
[02:07] with him I think this concept of uh a
[02:11] PTC being a Bitcoin only company which
[02:15] um I have to emphasize which means only
[02:17] accepting Bitcoin payments and not just
[02:19] like not having cryptocurrency there's
[02:22] like a difference between being Bitcoin
[02:24] only and excluding cryptocurrencies and
[02:26] also
[02:28] excluding the US dollar and the euros
[02:30] and all the Feld like that's that's
[02:33] really cool I mentioned it I think a few
[02:35] times actually in the podcast till now
[02:38] yes it's it's an amazing thing uh but
[02:40] you know when we were in Abu Dhabi there
[02:42] was a lot of quinery happening uh
[02:45] even though it was under the under the
[02:47] radar per se but but uh but yeah uh
[02:51] Bitcoin only is is the name of the game
[02:53] and you know for us we think it's the
[02:55] best for the consumer it's the best for
[02:58] uh us and our our values right uh we
[03:01] don't want to accept things that uh you
[03:04] know that don't have value and we don't
[03:07] you know there all the other stuff is
[03:11] crypto you know quotes and quotes that's
[03:13] all uh you know for for all intents and
[03:16] purposes they are shitcoins and it's
[03:19] just technology so Bitcoin actually you
[03:22] know we're building something on top of
[03:23] Bitcoin and actually utilizing the
[03:25] network which is pretty
[03:27] cool it's it's but probably uh hard to
[03:31] build hard there to build a company
[03:34] around that because probably investors
[03:36] are looking like that oh like why are
[03:37] you not taking the money off of uh other
[03:40] people if they want to pay in Euros or
[03:43] dollars uh like why why are you saying
[03:45] no to customers that just say uh we want
[03:48] the different things like that's a hard
[03:50] hard stand on your
[03:52] side yes I mean it will maybe limit Us
[03:56] in some way shape or form uh but adop is
[04:00] happening every day you're doing you
[04:02] know God's work we're trying to do it as
[04:04] well making Bitcoin more salable and
[04:06] distributing it throughout the whole
[04:08] network of you know H you know humans on
[04:12] earth right so every day uh more and
[04:14] more people come to bitcoin and
[04:16] understand that you know it is the
[04:18] hardest currency on the
[04:19] planet are you trying also to to lift
[04:22] yourself on on on bitcoin as uh and and
[04:26] get away from the US dollar I think it's
[04:28] it probably is even harder on on a on on
[04:30] a individual basis because you have to
[04:33] deal with landlords you have to deal
[04:35] with with other things and the compan is
[04:37] more you can probably be a little bit
[04:39] more
[04:40] flexible well I I think uh living on the
[04:43] Bitcoin standard is not
[04:45] impossible right uh it just takes a
[04:47] little bit more effort I guess uh but
[04:50] it's really little to no effort now
[04:52] because technology has grown so rapidly
[04:55] all you have to do is have an app right
[04:58] uh here in the States you can you can
[05:00] buy on strike and uh hold all your
[05:03] assets and then you know like Jack MERS
[05:06] does when he when credit card payment
[05:08] comes due he sells some Bitcoin and pays
[05:11] his credit card off uh so it's not
[05:13] impossible to live on the Bitcoin
[05:15] standard um but uh you know I think
[05:19] Bitcoin travel is uh definitely going to
[05:21] be 2025 as price Rises we're going to
[05:24] see a lot more people taking vacations
[05:26] and um excursions and whatnot
[05:30] and we think that airb TC is poised to
[05:33] um really help in this regard is that
[05:37] the the best way to uh to do it
[05:39] currently with like a credit card that
[05:41] you just pay off in the end of the month
[05:42] with with Bitcoin uh es because yeah
[05:45] most Merchants still don't directly
[05:47] accept Bitcoin only through uh things
[05:50] like that right you'd have to use
[05:52] another app for sure but uh it's it's
[05:55] really not that much time you know or
[05:58] effort
[06:00] yeah it's I guess the best way to to get
[06:02] into the Bitcoin ecosystem um as close
[06:06] as possible I mean the best case would
[06:08] be you just have like a Bitcoin account
[06:10] and you can uh receive and pay
[06:13] everything with that but uh we H how far
[06:16] do you think we are from that like H how
[06:19] fast do you think we come
[06:21] to a world where at least in in some
[06:24] regions of the world you can fully live
[06:27] there I mean Salvador probably is close
[06:30] to that but I was there and even there I
[06:34] sometimes couldn't pay with Bitcoin
[06:36] directly uh so even there uh we we still
[06:39] have some time uh to to fulfill this
[06:42] this purpose yeah I'm not sure how long
[06:44] ago you travel to Salvador but uh I
[06:48] haven't had the same experience I've
[06:50] bought a mango or a Pusa or some small
[06:53] item um every vendor I've ever uh met
[06:58] down there they all accepted
[07:00] Bitcoin um and uh there's car services
[07:03] there's everything but as far as like
[07:05] worldwide adoption and utilizing Bitcoin
[07:08] uh I think it happens faster in places
[07:10] like El Salvador or Costa Rica or um in
[07:15] Africa where you know your currencies in
[07:18] some way shape or form can inflate
[07:20] overnight of 100% or um you know there's
[07:24] a lot of issues with currencies uh in
[07:27] third world second world uh countries
[07:30] uh around the world so but in the United
[07:32] States I I I don't think there's going
[07:34] to be adoption like that um just because
[07:37] we have this uh system uh it's much
[07:41] harder to crack right so uh the credit
[07:44] cards and uh how the ease of payment so
[07:47] all Merchants they just accept credit
[07:49] cards and you tap um and so so uh I
[07:54] don't think it happens as fast in the
[07:56] United States but definitely in in the
[07:59] smaller regions around the world um it's
[08:01] going to happen at a break neck speed it
[08:05] seems like the the the pain of the Fiat
[08:08] system uh highly uh influences how fast
[08:12] the Bitcoin adoption in a certain region
[08:15] is and the pain in El Salvador was a lot
[08:18] higher than the
[08:20] pain that is currently in the United
[08:22] States probably United States is the the
[08:25] pain the lowest I guess I I I don't know
[08:28] if if maybe swi is also probably really
[08:30] good where the banking system works
[08:32] quite well and uh the the money rights
[08:36] of of people are quite quite nicely
[08:39] treated uh compared to other Fiat
[08:42] currencies uh but we it seems like as as
[08:46] soon as we hit pain points of like
[08:49] hyperinflation or people getting uh just
[08:51] kicked out of the bank accounts which
[08:53] happens to a lot of people like uh I
[08:56] have uh people reach out to me from the
[08:58] United States that say like oh I have a
[09:01] bunch of businesses and now my main
[09:03] account all all of the sudden got got
[09:06] kicked me out and I needed to search for
[09:08] a new bank and stuff like that so like
[09:10] this is not only happening in in Costa
[09:13] Rica this also happening in the United
[09:15] States I mean Canada was a prime example
[09:17] trudo I think just just step back I
[09:20] think like a few days ago I saw it I
[09:21] think yesterday on Twitter um H how do
[09:24] you see the current developments of
[09:26] Bitcoin and uh the pain point of of F
[09:29] currencies right now is are we at a 10%
[09:33] pain point of for for fat and we need to
[09:35] be at like 50 to people really got start
[09:38] getting out I I think pain is felt in
[09:41] different ways for different people and
[09:43] the people that feel the most pain are
[09:45] the people with little to no assets
[09:48] right or little to no money um so and
[09:52] and that's not a country that's not a
[09:54] region that's literally humans right uh
[09:58] and we make those decisions
[10:00] you know uh the more prudent ones when
[10:03] when when needed so you know as as far
[10:06] as the pain tolerance I'm not sure what
[10:08] people are used to but as far as the
[10:10] United States you you know we've been
[10:12] paying credit card fees for a long time
[10:16] and it's and it's a good percentage of
[10:18] the um the transaction so like 3% in
[10:22] some cases 5% American Express or or
[10:26] other cards um and so the ter terminal
[10:29] or the the business owner has to pay
[10:31] those percentages right um but what they
[10:35] do is they inflate the price of whatever
[10:36] they're selling to incorporate your
[10:39] payment so I think it would bring bring
[10:42] payments down you know uh tremendously
[10:45] you know if we're if we're utilizing the
[10:47] the um you know using SATs or using
[10:52] lightning Network or liquid Bitcoin
[10:55] getting more institutionalized and
[10:57] getting more of like that only store of
[11:00] value route where it's like oh Bitcoin
[11:03] is an asset and we can borrow against it
[11:05] and we can just use the US dollar as as
[11:07] a mean of exchange and unit of account
[11:10] um we we just uh Buy in the ETFs we just
[11:13] buy it with black rock uh and that kind
[11:15] of world where Bitcoin is just a great
[11:18] store of value uh and and we never
[11:21] really use it as a medium exchange um I
[11:25] I Fe it a little bit where I'm like
[11:27] maybe uh because so many of the
[11:31] bitcoiners uh especially outside of the
[11:34] hardcore group are really focused on the
[11:36] price and really focus on like hey
[11:38] number gra technology uh and they they
[11:41] don't really care about the possibility
[11:44] of a medium exchange unit of account um
[11:47] how do you see that when when Bitcoin
[11:50] might be just um a store of value are
[11:54] you are you seeing the danger in maybe
[11:56] that's happening or is that no concern
[11:59] for you right now yes I mean I meet a
[12:02] lot of people that uh that that is what
[12:05] they want to do and uh I understand
[12:07] huddle like I you know from from a
[12:10] personal perspective and from a
[12:12] financial perspective it makes sense to
[12:14] huddle most of your wealth in Bitcoin
[12:16] right but um if you can if it's easy for
[12:20] you to live your everyday life and
[12:23] exchange your whatever Fiat job the
[12:26] dollars you make from that if you just
[12:28] exchange it into coin um and you can buy
[12:32] products with uh you know that are
[12:35] similar uh in nature or um you know the
[12:39] same value that you'd find and you can
[12:41] just pay in Bitcoin uh and I think I
[12:44] think it makes the the network more
[12:46] salable people are using it more often
[12:49] um I do think it's I do think there is
[12:52] some detriment to all this ETF buying
[12:55] and um institutional adoption which is
[12:58] good
[12:59] uh in some respects if number go up but
[13:02] it's not getting into as many hands uh
[13:05] throughout the world in which it needs
[13:06] to it's also what I kind of see is like
[13:09] almost like uh nation states are waking
[13:12] up big corporations are waking up and
[13:15] Retail is kind of kind of sleeping when
[13:17] when I mean that's always a subjective
[13:19] thing depending on where you are but
[13:21] when I look in my uh uh family my friend
[13:25] circles that aren't into Bitcoin and
[13:27] aren't in the Bitcoin Community They
[13:30] Don't Really Care that Bitcoin is 100k
[13:32] They Don't Really Care that Bitcoin is
[13:34] is doing all those great things they
[13:35] only see like oh I uses a lot of
[13:38] electricity and it's volatile that that
[13:40] that's what they see H and it's it's
[13:43] really frustrating to a certain extent
[13:45] where like oh like Black Rock gets it
[13:47] the big corporations get it the micro
[13:48] strategies and other uh huge
[13:50] corporations get it and they stack
[13:52] really hard but the the single mom that
[13:56] actually needs it they they they say
[13:58] it's too speculative it's it's it's kind
[14:00] kind of sad to witness for me
[14:02] honestly yeah I I it is very sad um so
[14:06] that's why it's it's everyone's job who
[14:08] already understands Bitcoin and the
[14:11] value um to actually propose this to as
[14:15] many people as humanly possible across
[14:17] the planet because you know it's it's
[14:19] like being bitten by a vampire right in
[14:21] some
[14:22] regards uh you want to go you want to go
[14:25] Express that knowledge you know to
[14:28] others absolutely I love that bit
[14:31] vampire and and uh you you you have to
[14:34] buy another buy as many as you can and I
[14:38] think that's H it's also like when you
[14:40] imagine the the the Christmas table uh
[14:43] and and you like oh like I don't know
[14:46] 2023 you maybe were the first Bitcoin at
[14:50] the Christmas table then you orange bued
[14:52] one like one year later maybe you're two
[14:54] of them and at some point you're like
[14:56] three four maybe at some point you're
[14:57] like 50% of the crowd and it gets really
[15:00] good so like uh orange pill the people
[15:03] that that you love and that you are
[15:05] close to you that I think that should be
[15:06] the the main message uh that that we
[15:09] should pursue really cool and then
[15:12] strategic Bitcoin reserve and all all
[15:14] the other things they also come but I I
[15:17] hope they come later I'm actually afraid
[15:20] that America is buying too many Bitcoins
[15:22] this
[15:23] year well I I think I think once people
[15:27] um it's in its I think that's why
[15:29] shitcoins are so prevalent or have been
[15:32] is because as Americans we think of
[15:34] things in numbers right so it's oh one
[15:36] bitcoin's 990,000 or 100,000 whatever
[15:39] the price is that's all they see is one
[15:42] right they they don't see the divisible
[15:44] Satoshi they don't see any of that um so
[15:48] the more people know about that and and
[15:51] that Satoshi are actually a real number
[15:54] right that you can utilize um eventually
[15:57] one Satoshi will be$ maybe or one
[15:59] Satoshi will be uh you know 5 cents or
[16:04] um
[16:05] so these things are relative but we need
[16:08] you know the reason why coinery is
[16:11] so popular I think is because they see
[16:13] the smaller number and they're like oh I
[16:14] can buy one salano for or five salano
[16:17] for whatever it is um and that and
[16:20] that's ingrained into Americans but what
[16:23] I've seen in El Salvador is you know
[16:25] they see the Satoshi and it's and it's
[16:28] kind of cool how how many Satoshi
[16:30] they're like oh I made this many Satoshi
[16:32] from 12 mango uh fruits you know it's
[16:37] it's it's great to see that they're
[16:39] rebranding the satosi so Salvador is
[16:42] already happening are you showing um uh
[16:45] Sates in in your platform or is like
[16:47] Bitcoin also yes so we actually have
[16:50] both both prices we have uh the Satoshi
[16:53] amount for this stay and then also the
[16:56] USD amount so as it fluctuates uh you
[17:01] know um we have to we have to show both
[17:04] even though the hardcore bitcoiners even
[17:06] me I'm I'm not that smart so it's best
[17:09] to have both prices just so the human
[17:11] brain can interact uh with how many
[17:15] Satoshi equal the dollars um so uh but
[17:19] in the future when the number becomes
[17:22] stable you know for Bitcoin uh then
[17:25] maybe we'll just have only Satoshi
[17:27] shown yeah
[17:29] the only payment is that's possible is
[17:31] Bitcoin even though it shows a USD price
[17:35] yeah I mean the unit of account is kind
[17:36] of the the last step right Med of
[17:39] exchanges before that um is is if
[17:42] someone is putting a listing on there do
[17:45] do they do it in US dollar probably
[17:49] denominator because soses will be like a
[17:52] uh do too hard of a swing yes they need
[17:56] they need the USD price um but uh but
[17:59] all the payments happen in Bitcoin over
[18:02] the lightning Network or on chain if if
[18:04] you'd like but it's not preferable
[18:06] because the fees are just kind of high
[18:09] and eventually they'll be way too high
[18:12] for anyone to
[18:14] imagine yeah that's that's another
[18:16] discussion how how we scale Bitcoin
[18:18] maybe we can do that later a little bit
[18:20] also how you imagine that um I want to
[18:23] also talk about before the the circular
[18:26] economy uh rening to to satosi and that
[18:30] overall need for us to push towards that
[18:33] Med exchange things and and what we can
[18:36] do in there um do do we Bitcoin and
[18:40] actively need to seek out or we we we
[18:42] have to spend our satosi somewhere to
[18:45] get that circular economy uh starting
[18:48] how important is is the circular economy
[18:50] of of Bitcoin aspect to it or is that
[18:53] something that anyways comes with with
[18:56] time I think we need to actively pursue
[18:59] more circular economies uh I know that
[19:02] we've been in contact with a lot a lot
[19:04] of them across the the Earth and um you
[19:08] know they can pop up out of nowhere it
[19:11] just starts with one person who wants to
[19:13] espouse this vampirism or whatever it is
[19:17] right that we all must own it and and
[19:19] hold it and spend it and uh replace it
[19:22] because uh it's it's this cycle that we
[19:25] need to continue to uh to tell as many
[19:28] people as possible about Bitcoin so I
[19:31] think uh airb is poised to be a part of
[19:34] those circular economies as they pop up
[19:36] because if you are a land owner in your
[19:39] certain region and you have a short-term
[19:41] rental already um and and now you've
[19:44] just been orange pilled so it would make
[19:47] a lot of sense to to accept um the
[19:51] hardest currency on the planet once you
[19:52] know about it and it and you can still
[19:55] just like uh if you have a current uh
[19:58] list on Airbnb I guess you can just list
[20:01] it also on air PTC is there is there
[20:03] something against that that you just
[20:05] list it also on a new platform or do you
[20:07] have to switch is there some rule for
[20:09] yeah yeah for that no you don't have to
[20:12] you don't have to switch you can they
[20:14] can be simultaneous um and we have uh
[20:17] some calendar tools that help uh with
[20:22] the fact of double booking is horrible
[20:25] within the industry uh so we want to
[20:27] make sure that we don't do any booking
[20:29] so um you know that's the number one
[20:31] goal of our customer service team is is
[20:33] to make sure that that happens
[20:35] flawlessly um but uh but for sure you
[20:38] can be on multiple platforms and have uh
[20:40] air PTC as one of five or 10 however
[20:44] many you use normally people only do two
[20:46] or three but uh I've in some cases
[20:50] there's certain hotel chains and whatnot
[20:52] that use so many different apps and and
[20:56] uh um and and uh other purveyors of
[21:00] travel um but uh but yeah there's
[21:03] there's there's many options out there
[21:05] but we think that we're poised to um
[21:08] help out the orange pilled individual
[21:10] that's across this planet I partnered up
[21:13] with coin vigilante this is the most
[21:16] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[21:19] saw created by anyone look at that
[21:22] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[21:25] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[21:28] the per perfect subtle elegent way to go
[21:31] out there and show that you are a
[21:33] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[21:36] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[21:39] dropped a completely new and amazing
[21:41] Genesis edition of their watch
[21:44] collections you have the date of the
[21:46] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[21:50] and of course also the block height and
[21:52] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[21:56] level of detail they put in in this
[21:58] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[22:01] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces

[22:06] watches so so much if you watch or
[22:10] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[22:12] I'll guess you already bought some
[22:14] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[22:17] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[22:20] in a hardware wallet my personal
[22:22] recommendation for hard wallet is the
[22:24] bit box it's super secure it's simple to
[22:27] set up it's also perfect gift for a
[22:29] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[22:32] exchange and you can get a 5% discount

[22:42] your bitbox and the next step is to
[22:44] really level up your sovereignty as an
[22:46] individual you have to have the most
[22:49] secure self- custody setup you have to
[22:51] secure your own devices you have to
[22:54] protect your privacy you have to set up
[22:57] an inherent plan and depending on where
[23:00] you live you even want to have a plan B
[23:03] a citizenship where you can move in case
[23:05] something goes really really wrong and
[23:07] through all those steps the Bitcoin way

[23:18] minute free call to find out how you can
[23:21] level up your sovereignty I mean it's
[23:25] it's isn't an amazing mission that
[23:27] you're trying here to disrupt
[23:29] traditional platforms like Airbnb or
[23:32] even like booking.com uh because it does
[23:35] similar things you want to stay some for
[23:37] shortterm uh that does booking Airbnb I
[23:40] don't even know some some other
[23:42] platforms because I usually only use use
[23:45] those um how is that like how is the
[23:49] fight against those huge companies a
[23:51] huge
[23:52] platforms um going and and how is that
[23:55] disrupting traditional platforms as you
[23:59] like a the the startup of that part yeah
[24:04] I don't think it's disrupting anything
[24:06] uh and and as far as taking market share
[24:09] I don't think there's a huge um huge
[24:13] take as of yet um but in the future um
[24:17] as more and more people get orange
[24:19] pilled we will grow in magnitude um and
[24:25] this thing is growing faster than the
[24:27] internet Bitcoin is
[24:29] uh it is uh it's it's like the cheetah
[24:33] in the race and I think Bitcoin is out
[24:36] outrunning everyone and will outrun
[24:39] everyone in the future and you know if
[24:41] you're not on the train uh you should
[24:43] get on it as as soon as possible because
[24:45] hopefully it doesn't leave the station
[24:48] uh because once we get to a million once
[24:50] Bitcoin goes to a million or five
[24:51] million whatever that number is um it's
[24:54] just going to be harder and harder to
[24:55] onboard folks onto the network so
[24:58] um we need to do it
[25:00] now what do you mean with hard to
[25:03] onboard
[25:05] people um it's it's the mental the
[25:08] mental uh investment perspective or the
[25:12] fact of um people wanting to spend right
[25:16] so how could you ever buy it if it's 5
[25:18] million if if you're that single mom who
[25:20] makes you know uh 30 grand a year or 40
[25:24] Grand a year it's going to be very hard
[25:26] for them to to get in and if they do
[25:29] hopefully everything's repriced in
[25:31] Satoshi by then and then uh all is all
[25:34] is well absolutely yeah I mean I hope uh
[25:37] probably between like a million and 10
[25:39] million the the the Natural Evolution
[25:42] will be that we will price things in in
[25:46] satosi uh or maybe Nakamoto or micro
[25:49] satosi or what whatever we come up with
[25:52] uh something something like that because
[25:54] one Bitcoin like if one Bitcoin is
[25:57] seriously million and not just like
[26:00] because of the devaluation but also like
[26:02] buying buying power million uh from
[26:05] today's standpoint then we we definitely
[26:08] need some some some out currency between
[26:11] that because nobody wants to speak about
[26:13] ah yeah like that's like
[26:15] 0.000000001 Bitcoin like that that
[26:18] that's a weird way to to say
[26:20] anything right right I I think all that
[26:23] stuff will come I mean we're so early
[26:25] Robin and you know you really are doing
[26:28] satoshi's work by going out and uh
[26:31] trying to meet as many people and and uh
[26:33] document it uh so we really appreciate
[26:36] what you do oh thank you so much um
[26:39] let's come with to to the thing of
[26:41] because it fits nicely here how we scale
[26:45] Bitcoin and uh you use Bitcoin probably
[26:48] way more than the the average uh Bitcoin
[26:51] already because I guess the average
[26:53] bitcoiner buys it and holds it somewhere
[26:56] uh and if you regular regly uh pay with
[27:00] that or get paid in that um you already
[27:03] have a lot of experience there how do
[27:05] you think we scale Bitcoin uh especially
[27:08] because we need the second layers
[27:10] because not everyone can be on on the
[27:11] main layer yes I I think uh we're going
[27:14] to see layer threes layer fours you're
[27:17] going to see a lot more layers um as
[27:20] time goes on and I think it's needed I
[27:22] mean you know people went against
[27:25] ordinals when they came out and they're
[27:27] like oh it's going to ruin it's ruining
[27:29] Bitcoin or whatever not really in in
[27:32] reality it's it's just testing the
[27:34] network and that's what it constantly
[27:36] needs to be tested and um to make it
[27:39] harder and um I think that over time
[27:44] there's going to be a lot more testing
[27:46] that's being done um and it's only what
[27:49] 16 years old now something like that um
[27:54] so we're so we're so new no so fresh
[27:57] like in 30 30 years now you know if you
[28:00] saw reality it's probably something we
[28:02] never could have imagined you know how
[28:05] where they where they took it uh or
[28:07] where we are taking it now you know
[28:10] absolutely I I love that aspect and I
[28:13] mean it's also interesting to see um how
[28:17] how the future will be because we don't
[28:19] have enough space on the on the main lay
[28:21] of everyone uh so we'll have to at some
[28:24] point uh have layer twos layer threes as
[28:27] we already have have them um but do you
[28:30] think there's also room for Bitcoin
[28:32] Banks like do you do you imagine a micro
[28:34] strategy or maybe like a an OG who has a
[28:38] th000 Bitcoin or 5,000 Bitcoin laying
[28:41] around uh him being some sort of local
[28:45] Regional Bank for with like fedt and
[28:48] stuff like
[28:49] that yeah that's that's one of the most
[28:51] interesting thing that's that's
[28:53] happening is the fediman and the um the
[28:57] regional Su spendable power of those uh
[29:01] those
[29:02] Satoshi um I I do think it's the future
[29:06] and and it you know there's so many
[29:08] things uh that go along with that I
[29:11] think there's there's there's definitely
[29:13] some privacy things right so as far as
[29:16] when once you go in or go out the fedit
[29:18] knows you know what you know address you
[29:21] have and whatnot but what happens within
[29:23] the network is is kind of um just kind
[29:26] of gray which is I'm not sure how that's
[29:29] going to work globally but um it's
[29:31] definitely very cool to think
[29:33] about absolutely I'm looking forward to
[29:36] that one um what another aspect that
[29:39] which is really interesting is is
[29:41] Bitcoin tourism for me where uh we've
[29:45] seen it with El Salvador I was only
[29:47] there because of
[29:48] Bitcoin if there was not so many bit so
[29:50] much Bitcoin going on I probably
[29:52] wouldn't have visited uh last year and I
[29:55] probably wouldn't have visited any time
[29:58] because I'm not a surfer so that's the
[30:00] two reasons people come there Bitcoin
[30:02] and surfing uh maybe because uh of other
[30:06] reasons also but I'm not aware of them
[30:08] um how do you do do you already kind of
[30:10] see that that Bitcoin tourism that like
[30:12] Bitcoin is is a great marketing Tool uh
[30:16] across the globe for Regions but also
[30:19] for for companies oh for sure I think El
[30:21] Salvador's definitely uh poised to be
[30:24] the front runner it's the Singapore of
[30:27] the 22nd C you know how Bitcoin is as a
[30:30] marketing tool maybe you have some some
[30:32] insights in that because you see where
[30:35] Bitcoin uh basically comes in the the
[30:37] circular economy and how Bitcoin is
[30:40] almost like a a a pull factor for
[30:45] businesses if they uh adopt it I mean we
[30:47] saw it with El salador we saw it a
[30:49] little bit with micro strategy they're
[30:51] doing a lot better now with with with
[30:53] Bitcoin versus non-bitcoin uh and they
[30:56] are probably a lot of other examples of
[30:59] that how how do you see Bitcoin as like
[31:01] a marketing tool I think it's very
[31:04] marketable I think it's the Hot Topic
[31:06] right it's at 100K now um which I mean
[31:10] it's very exciting but um you know it's
[31:13] it was eventual it's still it's going
[31:16] higher it's always going to go higher um
[31:19] but I think it's great Bitcoin is a
[31:21] marketing tool in its own uh El
[31:23] Salvador's taken it on but there's other
[31:25] circular economies popping up all over
[31:27] the globe
[31:28] uh you know Indonesia and Bali I know
[31:31] there's uh big bit Bitcoin presence
[31:33] there and um a lot of Bitcoin tourism
[31:36] that's happening El Salvador is
[31:38] definitely the number one uh but you're
[31:39] going to see other ones come through
[31:41] like Costa Rica and Bitcoin jungle um
[31:44] circular economies um in Surinam or in
[31:48] Colombia Brazil um Dominican
[31:52] Republic um I think there's going to be
[31:54] a lot of Tourism that happens in those
[31:57] places especially if if you know that
[31:59] you can go and uh spend a night at a
[32:02] local hotel and and make Bitcoin more
[32:05] sailable and go eat dinner and have
[32:07] drinks and get to pay in Bitcoin for all
[32:10] of those things I think as um a hardcore
[32:13] bitcoiner or someone who's uh wants to
[32:17] distribute the network and uh make it
[32:20] grow on their own terms um they're going
[32:23] to go to places like El Salvador and
[32:25] Costa Rica and these these smaller uh C
[32:28] economies because you're doing God's
[32:30] work you know or satoshi's work you know
[32:33] are are you seeing Satoshi as God no no
[32:36] it's just you know it's something that
[32:38] it's there there are many comparisons
[32:40] right Immaculate Conception like where
[32:42] did it come from you know there's so
[32:43] many I I like a good story and uh you
[32:47] know I I see them in similar lights
[32:49] because I know both stories right ah
[32:53] okay interesting I had uh I had some
[32:57] religious guys also on who who were like
[33:00] uh Bitcoin and the Bible I had uh what
[33:03] is the book called uh from Pastor Co I
[33:06] think he's probably known uh Pastor Co
[33:08] was also on it's it's always fascinating
[33:11] to see the
[33:13] similarities of Christianity and maybe
[33:16] other religions to to bitcoin and and
[33:19] Global movements um it's it's a it's a
[33:23] it's an it's an interesting topic also
[33:25] for me I'm not that religious so it's a
[33:28] hard one to get in for me but uh it's
[33:31] definitely something I'm I'm aware of
[33:34] because of the the bitcoiners and
[33:36] bitcoiners kind of make me more
[33:37] religious I have to look into more more
[33:40] in in in in that aspect I don't know how
[33:43] this was for
[33:44] you yeah I'm I'm not overly religious I
[33:48] just uh it's it's a term I like to use
[33:50] when you know there's so many words for
[33:53] God out there right um and and so many
[33:56] different gods in different religions
[33:58] across the planet but if we all um if we
[34:02] all are striving towards this goal
[34:04] together um in many ways it is kind of a
[34:07] the Pinnacle right we're we're doing the
[34:10] work of you know whoever it is you name
[34:13] it um but
[34:16] Satoshi you know you can call them many
[34:19] things or they or them you know do do
[34:21] you have a theory who satos Nakamoto is
[34:25] not at all do you
[34:28] uh no actually not no I'm just asking
[34:30] because two episodes ago I had I had uh
[34:34] someone on who had the theory of John na
[34:38] John Nash yeah it's John Nash being
[34:40] satos Nakamoto uh and it was the best
[34:43] theory I ever heard that it was like oh
[34:45] that's interesting uh but it's still
[34:47] like you cannot really prove it and I
[34:49] think it will will never be uh there's
[34:51] never connection especially as John Nash
[34:53] is dead since 2015 so it's really hard
[34:56] to to prove
[34:58] since uh
[35:00] John John Nash is also that but yeah it
[35:03] was a good like it was the most
[35:05] compelling Story I Heard so far there's
[35:08] so many stories and so many theories
[35:10] that um I think are great it's it's good
[35:14] to to to try and search for it but
[35:17] reality says if they ever find out who
[35:20] really is satosi right um that most
[35:23] likely that person's not alive anymore
[35:25] but um you know if the person were to be
[35:28] alive it would be horrible for the
[35:30] network right um it would be the vlat
[35:33] teric buin of of uh you know someone to
[35:37] go after someone to look for you know
[35:39] whatever um but uh but I I I don't think
[35:43] it really matters who Satoshi are
[35:44] because you are Satoshi I'm Satoshi
[35:47] we're out there we're doing we're doing
[35:49] the work we're trying to get Bitcoin in
[35:52] as many hands as possible and for people
[35:54] to understand that they can utilize a
[35:56] network for little to no cost and uh on
[36:01] uh on many different I mean everyone has
[36:03] cell phones around the world now so even
[36:06] the poorest people on the planet have
[36:07] have cell phones and um I think I think
[36:10] we need to make Bitcoin more salable
[36:12] that's that's that's my goal and uh
[36:15] that's the goal of airb TC uh to to
[36:18] further the
[36:20] network what does it actually mean I
[36:22] heard that uh and and I can roughly get
[36:25] there but what does it mean to be more
[36:27] available is it mean that more Merchants
[36:30] adopted or yes it's means it's more
[36:33] transactable it's uh people buy and sell
[36:36] it uh or people use it for
[36:40] payments
[36:43] um and I think that helps with the
[36:45] circular economies right okay it's just
[36:49] uh definition of like okay we we use it
[36:51] more as a mean of exchange rather than
[36:53] just it laying around uh in in some
[36:56] wallet which also is
[36:58] I think a use case of Bitcoin but uh we
[37:00] we should get to Circular Economist and
[37:04] one thing that I just thought about
[37:06] which is really interesting uh
[37:07] bitcoiners don't like to have assets
[37:09] outside of of Bitcoin uh but if you have
[37:13] a listing on iptc it kind of means you
[37:16] have to have
[37:17] an real estate property H how how do you
[37:21] see uh that real estate versus Bitcoin
[37:24] debate and uh especially uh as as you
[37:27] see or maybe are in touch with a lot of
[37:30] bitcoiners who have real estate and
[37:32] properties uh I I think real estate goes
[37:34] hand inand with Bitcoin uh because it's
[37:37] a hard asset it's always been known as a
[37:39] hard asset um even though there's taxes
[37:43] Insurance there's other costs that go
[37:45] involved with real estate uh I think
[37:46] there's a lot of similarities um but
[37:49] what we're going to see actually in the
[37:50] future and this my prediction is that as
[37:53] Bitcoin Rises
[37:55] the the industry or um assets that'll
[38:00] Rise um equally or or along with uh will
[38:05] be real estate because a lot of people
[38:07] hey your Bitcoin went up to a half a
[38:09] million um a lot of people are going to
[38:12] take some of the Bitcoin off the table
[38:14] and buy real estate with it um because
[38:16] they know people will rent it from them
[38:19] or um they want to put their family in
[38:21] it um housing is definitely uh housing
[38:25] and commercial property are going to be
[38:27] uh huge in the future so um when it
[38:30] comes to bitcoin you know people will
[38:33] trade Bitcoin for real estate and it's
[38:35] already happening uh and uh we're doing
[38:39] it on a on a smaller scale uh currently
[38:42] but there's many verticals in our
[38:44] business that uh would suggest that we
[38:47] will facilitate uh transactions in the
[38:49] future for
[38:51] sure I think once uh my stack buys me my
[38:56] dream house
[38:58] like 5% of my stack buys me a dream
[39:02] house I might be tempted to do that like
[39:05] right now I'm like so far away from
[39:08] buying real estate I'm like like not not
[39:11] even close to even uh thinking about
[39:14] that but once the stack and the pying
[39:17] power of your stack is so great that
[39:20] even with a small percentage you can buy
[39:23] a safe house in a neighborhood or a
[39:26] country that you like and you have been
[39:28] in since a multiple years or maybe your
[39:31] whole life and you feel good in that
[39:33] neighborhood uh I think a lot of
[39:35] bitcoiners will be tempted uh to sell
[39:38] some of the BTC and trade it in for a
[39:41] home for for your family I think that's
[39:43] it's a fair deal uh it's it's something
[39:45] good and we should use our Bitcoin like
[39:49] I think the worst thing is to just die
[39:51] with a bunch of Bitcoin and and not use
[39:54] it at all I mean of course you can build
[39:56] generation wealth you can give it to
[39:58] your kids and grandkids and all that
[40:00] stuff but you should also have some fun
[40:03] with it and and and improve your life
[40:05] now and not just have the the lowest
[40:08] time preference and don't do anything
[40:10] with it I think that's an important
[40:12] message especially for Bitcoin us for
[40:14] sure and and uh you know we all want to
[40:17] live longer right so yeah go out and buy
[40:20] that cold plunge and your
[40:22] sauna uh you know and do more push-ups
[40:25] like my my uh my my part hre does uh
[40:28] he's a big push-up guy um I don't know
[40:31] if he told you but uh but yeah I think
[40:34] we talked uh isn't he also a big kalenic
[40:38] guy yes he is I think um and I have one
[40:42] question that I ask each one of my
[40:44] guests and and I will ask you that also
[40:46] in a minute uh but I think in that
[40:49] question he brought up
[40:50] callisthenics uh if I remember cor
[40:53] correctly it's it's it's already like
[40:54] 100 episodes back or something like that
[40:56] so it's it's it's hard to remember but I
[40:58] think he brought up calisthenics and he
[41:01] was actually an encouragement for me to
[41:02] try calisthenics and I did it uh before
[41:06] the Christmas holidays a lot but then it
[41:09] got really cold in Austria with like uh
[41:13] minus Celsius degrees like minus five
[41:15] and stuff like that where you you grab
[41:17] the bar even with uh cloths and you just
[41:20] freeze uh so it's really hard to do it
[41:22] outside and there are no inside
[41:25] calisthenics things
[41:27] except the gyms so I I will I will uh
[41:31] probably sign up with like a gym where I
[41:33] can do it also indoor uh but I'm looking
[41:36] for like outside is way better uh but uh
[41:39] the question that he got and that each
[41:41] and every one of my guests is getting is
[41:44] what can we learn from you besides
[41:46] Bitcoin and that's the point where he
[41:48] brought up uh callisthenics what is the
[41:51] point what the thing that we can learn
[41:52] from you outside of Bitcoin wow that's
[41:55] great uh I don't uh I would say I don't
[42:00] know to be
[42:01] um I don't know yoga I I like yoga uh
[42:06] I'm not a I'm not a big calisthenics guy
[42:09] uh I used to play um Sports and whatnot
[42:12] and I like working out but um yeah I
[42:16] would say yoga it's it's very peaceful
[42:18] it's it gets you in tune um I know you
[42:21] like being outside you were just
[42:23] mentioning that doing yoga Outdoors
[42:25] getting in the Sun you know it's so good
[42:28] you know being outside and living
[42:30] actually living because we can talk
[42:32] about Bitcoin all day and being in these
[42:34] uh you know in front of a mic and um and
[42:38] espouse about the future and what we
[42:40] want to do but every day living every
[42:42] day right that's that's the biggest part
[42:45] and uh we want to live longer I think
[42:46] bitcoiners are all in unison with we
[42:49] want to live healthy long lives and um I
[42:53] think that's why that's why air BTC is
[42:56] so good because who don't you want in
[42:59] your house renting a short-term rental
[43:01] other than a bitcoiner like you know
[43:04] we're we're very um I don't know I feel
[43:06] I feel like there's so many bitcoiners
[43:08] that have the same we're all different
[43:10] but we all have something that's very
[43:12] very similar you know um at least the
[43:15] majority of us do and uh it's probably
[43:17] the best customer and guest to have a
[43:21] bitcoiner uh in your home like that's
[43:23] the the one that probably treats your
[43:25] home as so also as as the best you can
[43:29] exactly yeah and they'll probably offer
[43:31] you a full Carn carnivore meal and uh
[43:35] make you do
[43:36] calisthenics you know and skip the
[43:38] dessert or something I don't know I love
[43:40] that I love that really cool we have an
[43:43] end routine in the podcast where uh the
[43:45] previous guest is asking a question for
[43:47] next guest uh without knowing who the
[43:49] next guest actually is and your question
[43:52] from the previous guest is an
[43:54] interesting one not not a lot to do with
[43:56] Bitcoin
[43:58] but how do you stay humble how do you
[44:00] stay humble uh life is humbling right I
[44:05] have kids I'm a girl Dad I'm humbled
[44:08] every day you know Daddy your belly or
[44:11] you know why are you so sleepy you know
[44:15] so uh I'm constantly being judged at
[44:17] home so uh that's how I stay humble as
[44:20] uh as a girl dad you know just have some
[44:23] children and uh you'll be humbled quite
[44:26] quickly have a daughter and she will
[44:28] humble you yes the easiest way
[44:32] yes amazing thank you so much Jake for
[44:35] being on before I let you go where can
[44:36] people find you and where can people
[44:38] find
[44:39] rbtc yes we're air btconline you can
[44:42] find us on Twitter and um and on Noster
[44:45] perfect yeah do you also have a personal
[44:48] Twitter account or something like that
[44:49] no actually uh my personal Twitter got
[44:52] uh dismantled uh uh I got kicked off of
[44:55] Twitter and went to Noster
[44:57] um and uh so yeah that's my personal
[45:01] account is the business accounts now
[45:04] so that's
[45:07] great oh man Twitter Twitter is still
[45:10] not uh the the the best fre freedom of
[45:14] spee did you see today Mark saker's
[45:17] video of trying to uh move back like
[45:22] move forwards and copy Twitter with like
[45:25] no um
[45:27] uh freedom of speech like the what did
[45:30] he how did he phrase it that uh Facebook
[45:32] is now a freedom of speech platform and
[45:35] they are turning down their um I forgot
[45:39] how how he phrased it basically the the
[45:41] tool the algorithm that sensors you when
[45:44] you say something that is not good and
[45:46] he wants to turn that off and wants to
[45:48] make it free again and openly says that
[45:51] Twitter like X is a role model uh for
[45:54] that uh which is really in that that he
[45:58] goes that
[45:59] direction yeah I think I think it's very
[46:01] um I think it's very on on brand with uh
[46:05] who's you know the next Administration
[46:07] in the United States right and uh
[46:10] Facebook wants to be seen as winning
[46:12] right so why wouldn't they say we're the
[46:14] we're the freedom platform as well uh
[46:17] because you know what Elon did at at X
[46:19] is just I know it's uh he's doing God's
[46:23] work too right in many ways or satoshi's
[46:25] work um
[46:27] even though he talks about Doge too much
[46:30] but we'll we'll let that go but uh but
[46:33] no I I I think uh I think what he's done
[46:36] is is great and uh I'm not really sure
[46:38] what's going to happen in the future but
[46:40] I think everyone is going to be trying
[46:42] to do more uh in the space about freedom
[46:45] and freedom of speech uh you know uh
[46:48] because it's become such an integral
[46:50] part of our everyday lives you know if
[46:53] we can't speak our mind then what what
[46:55] what's it all for yeah and I think uh
[46:59] like the most freedom of speech
[47:00] platforms like Nostra or Rumble they
[47:03] force Twitter and YouTube to be more uh
[47:08] Freedom like more freedom oriented
[47:11] because now people have an exit wealth
[47:13] the same way of when we have Fiat uh now
[47:17] all of a sudden we have Bitcoin which
[47:19] forces the feat system to be more
[47:21] accountable they cannot be accountable
[47:23] that's the thing like they they lost
[47:25] kind of the game uh so so even if they
[47:28] try even if even if now the best guy
[47:31] comes in the Federal Reserve they cannot
[47:34] like it's it's it's not repairable at
[47:36] that point this whole thing uh so that
[47:40] that's another story but social media
[47:43] it's it's just a website that could be
[47:46] repairable uh and will be interesting
[47:49] how Nostra
[47:50] influences uh Twitter how Twitter
[47:52] influences Facebook or Facebook
[47:54] influences YouTube and I hope we get to
[47:57] a point where all the platforms are just
[47:59] way more freedom
[48:01] loving yeah I agree I think uh it's a
[48:04] low time preference as well right um I
[48:07] think it's going to take time uh but it
[48:10] starts with everyone right so we all
[48:11] must think uh in unison that free speech
[48:15] is like an inherent right and we should
[48:17] all fight for it in some way shape or
[48:18] form and if we demand it right if we
[48:21] actually want it uh at scale then it's
[48:25] more um it's EAS it's easierly uh
[48:29] easierly that's not a word uh it's it's
[48:33] accepted um much easier uh but for as
[48:38] far as um Noster I I would like to see a
[48:42] lot more growth in 2025 because it's
[48:45] still a little dismal when it when we're
[48:47] talking about numbers of people using
[48:49] the platform uh but um I think people
[48:52] need to use Noster they need to use air
[48:55] bbtc right and we need to continue to
[48:58] make the the network more salable and we
[49:01] need to distribute as many stats as we
[49:04] can um
[49:06] before the STS Get Out Of Reach right U
[49:10] before before we hit five million like
[49:12] you uh like you think we
[49:14] are absolutely five million and 10
[49:17] million and eventually the US dollar is
[49:19] no no longer there anymore it's just
[49:22] like that's scary yeah that's scary the
[49:25] only the only thing is like like on once
[49:27] we reach a million or 5 million what's
[49:30] the power buying power then of 5 million
[49:32] like that that's the only question of
[49:34] like is 5 million is then 5 million
[49:36] probably not 5 million is probably then
[49:38] at that's Point like more like
[49:39] 800,000 uh I don't know what the
[49:41] inflation rate there will be but it will
[49:43] be fun to see uh thank you so much uh
[49:46] Jake for being on um also thank you so
[49:48] much uh for everyone that's watching and
[49:50] listening for joining us today as always
