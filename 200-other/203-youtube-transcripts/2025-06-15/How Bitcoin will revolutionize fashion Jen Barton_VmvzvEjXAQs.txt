[00:00] 85% of the world's garbage is created by
[00:04] the fashion industry and one in five
[00:07] items of clothing is sent to the tip
[00:09] without even being worn once for the
[00:11] kids in school now you're going to have
[00:13] to wait 48 years before you can afford a
[00:18] mortgage for a property in Sydney and 18
[00:21] to 22 years if you're wanting to buy an
[00:23] apartment f w for example said yes to my
[00:27] podcast after it was there for like half
[00:30] month and it's like wow he he has such
[00:32] such a humility to go on a non-existing
[00:35] podcast that's the beautiful thing about
[00:37] the Bitcoin Community is such a
[00:39] supportive space and everyone's a win
[00:41] for me is a win for all of us the
[00:43] Bitcoin community in general is
[00:44] extremely supportive they want to help
[00:46] each other yes there's also this this
[00:48] toxic side in in Bitcoin Twitter where
[00:51] when it gets like oh this and that but
[00:53] in general bitcoiners actually want to
[00:55] help each other
[01:00] what did inspire you to to start it why
[01:02] did you start your Bitcoin
[01:04] business um it's a funny story I
[01:07] actually started the business for a um a
[01:11] marketing course that I was doing I had
[01:13] to create a faux business uh for the
[01:15] project and um because I had an interest
[01:18] in Bitcoin I actually hadn't um invested
[01:21] I just um I discovered it back in 2015
[01:24] and knew that it was going to be a hit
[01:26] but um didn't do anything about it with
[01:29] investing for myself
[01:30] um but I loved it and so I chose that as
[01:33] my my faux business originally it was
[01:36] going to be um education base um but
[01:40] then as I got to know the community as I
[01:42] got to like you know dig around and see
[01:43] what was going on in the Bitcoin space I
[01:46] was like no I want to I want to sort of
[01:49] create like you know be a bit more
[01:50] creative and um and then the idea of
[01:53] creating fashion for women um became the
[01:57] subject um I noticed that there were
[01:59] like it's quite a saturated space in
[02:02] regards to um the male audience but
[02:07] there's very little that's um out there
[02:09] that's targeted directly to women I mean
[02:11] yeah that there might be a reason
[02:13] because I see the statistics in in my
[02:16] viewership uh and I have like 95% male
[02:19] audience uh and even like the the
[02:22] biggest um female podcaster Natalie
[02:26] prenell I think she's the biggest one in
[02:28] in the female as a female lead one and
[02:32] she posted the statistic she has like
[02:34] 20% female audience like even a female
[02:37] podcast only has like 20% female
[02:39] audience uh so so like there they're
[02:42] just like so much more men than women in
[02:45] in Bitcoin and I often ask myself like
[02:47] why and we even like I had two podcasts
[02:50] addressing that topic like why and what
[02:52] could we do uh better do do you have
[02:55] like anything like what do you how how
[02:58] we could achieve like a more because I
[03:00] mean in the end everyone will get
[03:02] Bitcoin and in the end everyone will
[03:03] have Bitcoin so in the end it will be
[03:06] 50/50 anyways um but uh for me the main
[03:10] reason right now is like probably men
[03:12] are usually a little bit more interested
[03:14] in tech and and and money it seems like
[03:17] do you also see like that's the reason
[03:19] why not more females are here it's
[03:22] possible but I mean my brain goes on to
[03:25] thinking is it that there's not that
[03:28] many women in Bitcoin or is it that
[03:30] there not that many women active in the
[03:31] Bitcoin Community um there's a lot of
[03:34] ogs and um things like that who like to
[03:36] keep uh their privacy um and it could be
[03:40] partners of bitcoiners who are active in
[03:42] the community so the males are the one
[03:43] that's out there um learning talking
[03:47] interacting and wives girlfriends
[03:50] daughters are sort of on the sidelines
[03:53] I've wondered about it if it was if it
[03:55] really is such a big gender gap or is it
[03:58] just um about activity in the space yeah
[04:02] mail tends to be more outgoing usually
[04:06] and and be more loud so it could be
[04:09] something yeah well the meetups that I
[04:11] go to here in Sydney it um I've noticed
[04:14] it um to be the case is that the males
[04:17] are the ones at the meetups and yet
[04:19] they're mentioning their Partners back
[04:20] home so it's it's yeah it's it's it's
[04:25] crossed my mind that maybe there are a
[04:27] lot more women in Bitcoin than we really
[04:29] realize um and it's just about um trying
[04:32] to get them to be more included into the
[04:34] community and more active in the space
[04:36] is that what you're trying with with
[04:38] with Bitcoin Dar is also yeah definitely
[04:42] um trying to get them to wear wear the
[04:45] clothing represent um get people talking
[04:49] and sort of take up space in the
[04:51] community and have a voice um and also
[04:55] in stuff that's made for them so I
[04:58] understand like there's some there some
[05:00] great um Merchants out there who have
[05:02] who have got some great designs and
[05:03] great t-shirts and that but um I really
[05:07] wanted to make something that was
[05:08] specifically for women so it was
[05:10] intended for uh to be worn by them when
[05:13] it comes to the designs the the Styles
[05:16] and the shapes of the clothing um just
[05:19] so that they like they feel comfortable
[05:21] I don't know about you but um if I'm
[05:23] going to an event um or going to meet up
[05:26] with some friends if I'm dressed well if
[05:28] I feel comfortable I'm in a better mood
[05:31] and I'm a bit more confident so and I
[05:33] think that's um kind of the the key that
[05:37] I'm trying to achieve with the Bitcoin
[05:39] Diaries I I usually go out with that one
[05:42] now I have like the Robin S
[05:46] podcast I I also I also sell it but I
[05:49] don't expect anyone to to buy it I I
[05:51] just like I want to have a t-shirt where
[05:53] I like Robin S podcast written on there
[05:55] so I can go out and everyone like sees
[05:57] like oh what's the Robin S podcast and
[05:59] then like yeah I'm
[06:01] Robin it's just a a really small
[06:04] marketing tool and I was like I I can
[06:07] have my own own own thing uh and I I
[06:10] thought about uh making a merch thing
[06:12] because my YouTube allows me to put a
[06:14] shelf uh under underneath my Bitcoin
[06:17] videos and I just put now this shirt on
[06:20] there um and I'm thinking of like Mak
[06:23] making something but as as my viewers as
[06:26] I already saw uh 95% of The View is male
[06:30] do you plan even to even though it's
[06:33] directed to women uh do you plan to also
[06:36] make like a male line something that is
[06:39] also specific for them yeah so that's
[06:41] already happening um my my very first
[06:45] customer was actually man um there so
[06:48] we've we've got um unisex sizes in the
[06:51] t-shirts the hoodies jumpers now we've
[06:53] got shoes now as well um and we're
[06:56] looking at some shorts and things like
[06:57] that so we're definitely catering to men
[07:00] it's just wanting to have that message
[07:02] that we're really like you know we
[07:04] really made this for the women um but
[07:06] definitely inclusive and get those guys
[07:08] in there and they they're loving the
[07:10] they're loving the designs and like the
[07:12] feedback that we're getting is great so
[07:14] I'm pretty happy about that and just the
[07:17] support that we get like the support
[07:19] that I get from both sides not just
[07:21] women but the men as well they're being
[07:22] so helpful um just wanting to give a
[07:25] hand um you know like you know whether
[07:29] it's just some advice or someone to talk
[07:31] to or anything like that or plugging
[07:33] plugging the business on Twitter um
[07:36] they're all doing their little bit I
[07:37] think that's the beautiful thing about
[07:39] the Bitcoin Community is is it's such a
[07:42] um supportive space and everyone's sort
[07:44] of like a win for me is a win for all of
[07:46] us so um yeah I really love that about
[07:49] about
[07:50] bitcoiners it's amazing I've come into
[07:53] the space and I started the podcast and
[07:55] I was not big on Twitter I was not known
[07:58] by anyone and that just started out with
[08:00] my podcast I came from it security sales
[08:04] and my experience was like oh you write
[08:07] 10 people uh and one maybe might be
[08:10] something like May one is might be
[08:13] interested in your messaging uh and then
[08:15] I came into Bitcoin I started that
[08:17] podcast and I was came coming in with
[08:19] the same mind I was like oh let's make a
[08:21] list of like 100 people that should be
[08:23] on my podcast and let's write all of
[08:26] them and that's why it's now daily
[08:28] because almost all all of them said
[08:31] yes really someone that's said no I
[08:34] don't want to be on your podcast and
[08:36] there are really big guys that came in
[08:38] really early like Jeff bof for example
[08:41] said yes uh to my podcast after it was
[08:45] there for like half a month and it's
[08:47] like wow he he has such such a humility
[08:51] to go on a non-existing podcast a really
[08:54] small one uh and support uh the this
[08:57] this thing and I just saw that that um
[09:00] the Bitcoin community in general is
[09:02] extremely supportive they want to help
[09:04] each other and yes there's also this
[09:07] this toxic side in in Bitcoin Twitter
[09:10] where when it gets like oh this and that
[09:12] but uh in general bitcoiners actually
[09:16] want to help each other yeah I agree
[09:19] definitely definitely what I've
[09:20] experienced and I've been in the Comm
[09:23] like actively in the community maybe
[09:25] eight nine
[09:27] months so yeah already like as soon as
[09:31] like you know soon as I jumped in um
[09:34] like well as soon as I started the um
[09:36] the business I was approached by um Love
[09:40] is Bitcoin to um to join a partnership
[09:43] with them um proof ofing to do a design
[09:47] collaboration they've just like they
[09:49] just all come in um uh access tribe to
[09:52] do a podcast um with her and this is
[09:55] like maybe four to six weeks after I
[09:59] launched amazing I love it so much that
[10:02] the the community is so supportive one
[10:05] question that I had in my mind you also
[10:07] have uh Bitcoin payments um I've seen
[10:10] with other merchants and other providers
[10:12] they say like oh only rarely people uh
[10:15] actually pay with with Bitcoin do you
[10:17] have some percentage that you can share
[10:19] like uh if if people actually use uh the
[10:22] the pay with Bitcoin uh option yeah
[10:26] about 70% use Bitcoin which um which
[10:29] yeah which really surprised me but um
[10:31] there's a lot of spending replace dudes
[10:34] um coming to the shop and and enjoying
[10:36] uh spending on spending in Bitcoin nice
[10:39] still um you're in in Australia and I
[10:42] guess there is like it's not it's not a
[10:47] Salvador there the fat world still uh in
[10:50] a different uh place there uh do you
[10:53] have any like problems with like
[10:56] accepting Bitcoin and then converting it
[10:59] because you also have to pay bills in in
[11:01] Fiat probably yeah um I haven't done my
[11:04] tax return yet but I've spoken to my
[11:06] accountant and it's going to be a bit of
[11:08] a like I was can we swear I was going to
[11:10] say show um
[11:13] so um yeah there's like there's things
[11:17] like I have to convert the amount so as
[11:19] soon as a customer pays in Bitcoin I
[11:22] have to convert that M um the amount um
[11:24] in Australian dollars and record um and
[11:27] record that amount I I can't leave um
[11:30] payments recorded in Bitcoin so I can
[11:34] keep I can keep it in in the um in open
[11:37] node to um as Bitcoin but all of the
[11:40] conversions have to be done for the
[11:42] records so the revenue counted is then
[11:47] in in in in uh Fiat currencies uh but
[11:52] you can keep it in in in Bitcoin which
[11:55] is also
[11:56] interesting yeah interesting interesting
[11:59] yeah yeah it's uh uh I I'm unfortunately
[12:03] not a business that can accept Bitcoin
[12:05] because I get my oh some some sponsors
[12:08] of mine uh paying Bitcoin but like the
[12:11] the most mer money is like YouTube
[12:13] Twitter other sponsors and it's like
[12:15] usually feat payments so I did not even
[12:18] uh had the chance to see like where is
[12:23] the oblig uh obligation when I get feed
[12:26] Bitcoin payments the only thing is like
[12:28] when I get tip in in Bitcoin but they're
[12:30] so small that my tax consultant says
[12:32] like oh it's it's it's okay till now
[12:35] because they're like really really small
[12:36] till now uh will be interesting how it's
[12:38] in Austria and in all around the world
[12:40] but I think it's similar I already heard
[12:42] that do you have a discount for Bitcoin
[12:44] payments or is that is that something
[12:46] that you consider uh I definitely
[12:48] consider I haven't set it up yet but um
[12:51] but yeah that's that's a good idea you
[12:54] got me you got me on there that's that's
[12:56] that's definitely something worth
[12:57] considering
[13:00] yeah I think it's great uh to
[13:02] incentivize Bitcoin I already I also saw
[13:05] that you have like Bitcoin payments
[13:07] preferred not accepted but preferred
[13:09] that's I really love that yeah that was
[13:12] a recent change I actually saw it on um
[13:15] panties for Bitcoin and I was like I
[13:17] love it and so I I took it for myself so
[13:21] yeah like and that's the thing like
[13:22] we're all learning from each other we um
[13:25] you know whoever's out in the space
[13:27] they're they're there for us to learn
[13:29] from and watch and and pick up little
[13:32] tidbits and tricks so yeah it's it's
[13:36] something that um I I I think it's a
[13:39] good message to have Bitcoin preferred
[13:41] rather than just
[13:42] accepted yeah definitely do do you come
[13:46] from from the fashion industry or what
[13:48] did you do uh before you started that uh
[13:52] I'm a graphic design up I trade so um I
[13:55] used to work in music and entertainment
[13:58] um and then later on in uh Corporate
[14:01] Finance um when I was working in music
[14:03] and entertainment I did a lot of band
[14:05] merch so when music um musicians and
[14:08] artists would tour the country I'd um
[14:11] I'd design their merch and their
[14:13] packaging for their albums and things
[14:15] like that so I've had experience there
[14:18] um and I think that's given me a a good
[14:21] leg up in um knowing how to design
[14:24] graphics for fabric how how different is
[14:26] it from designing for someone
[14:29] a merge to making a brand for me it's
[14:33] like yes I kind of have a merge with
[14:35] like my logo on there and then some some
[14:37] maybe some nice things that I usually
[14:40] say on the back or something like that
[14:42] but a brand it's is it different um I
[14:46] think because
[14:48] it's it's my own
[14:51] project there's not really any um
[14:53] restrictions to what I can create I'm
[14:56] sort of learning as I go so
[14:59] um the the logo that I I made I made
[15:02] really really quickly and I noticed like
[15:05] know there's a lot of problems with it
[15:06] and so I've had to flip it on its head
[15:08] and do some things different um changing
[15:12] from women only to expanding to men is
[15:15] another um challenge for the brand um
[15:19] and also thinking of um expanding into
[15:23] home wees because I got um a few
[15:24] requests that ladies are saying look um
[15:28] not like because we're trying to do um
[15:30] like we try to cater for all levels of
[15:33] um you know so bold statements and OBS
[15:36] um options um some women have said look
[15:39] we're not really um comfortable wearing
[15:41] Bitcoin merch merchandise but we'd love
[15:44] stuff for our home so um so that's
[15:47] something that I'm going to be looking
[15:49] into over the next
[15:50] month it's F it's interesting for me to
[15:53] see when uh we are not as comfortable
[15:56] wearing it's outside and I've also seen
[15:58] that with with bitcoiners they're like I
[16:00] don't want to have like a bit Bitcoin
[16:02] logo there I don't want to have like
[16:04] scream out on the world oh I'm I'm that
[16:06] I'm the Bitcoin
[16:08] guy yep there's um I did a poll actually
[16:11] on my Twitter and there's the whole
[16:13] Spectrum some of them are like yep we
[16:16] got to do our part we're part of the
[16:17] Bitcoin marketing team there's lots of
[16:19] discussions to be had um others are like
[16:23] um I want I'm I'm a bit concerned about
[16:26] my safety I don't want people knowing
[16:27] that I've got Bitcoin in case of this
[16:29] and that and other than just just like
[16:32] what like you said flat out no I don't
[16:34] you know it doesn't appeal to me so yeah
[16:37] um the whole spectrum is out there and I
[16:39] think that there's a possibility for me
[16:42] to cater to to all of them because
[16:47] um there's all yeah because there's all
[16:49] levels of of their interactivity with
[16:51] the Bitcoin Community they're also going
[16:53] to think to themselves
[16:56] well how how much it do I want to
[16:59] express in my fashion in my home wees in
[17:03] my shoes my you know accessories and
[17:07] things like that yeah and I think
[17:08] there's a a really big space uh and I
[17:11] think just Lena's art uh called there's
[17:16] a lot of that subtle thing I think she
[17:19] has like a a t-shirt a nice one with
[17:22] just a blizzard here for the lightning
[17:25] Network
[17:27] lightning yeah and um I think was it was
[17:30] it on Sailor that um had the they have
[17:32] the tiny little round Bitcoin right up
[17:35] at the neck and it's really cleverly
[17:37] placed because um it's perfect for when
[17:40] they've got their blade he's got his
[17:41] Blazer on and it just pops up there up
[17:43] the top I thought it was genius very
[17:45] very subtle elegant nice stuff and I
[17:49] like that uh that kind of thing because
[17:52] as you said it's genius to pop it here
[17:54] and yes sailor had it on Al when I
[17:56] interviewed him he he usually now has it
[17:59] always on this this Bitcoin shirt here
[18:01] uh and then he can his place on top of
[18:04] that and I think it's genius to have
[18:06] like very subtle things and very small
[18:09] things I also have a cap on that's
[18:11] completely black but it has a black uh
[18:14] icon with Bitcoin on top of it so if you
[18:16] look closely you actually see the
[18:18] Bitcoin logo but if you're just like
[18:20] passing by you don't you don't really
[18:22] notice it so I like uh the style where
[18:25] it's like it it says Bitcoin or Bitcoin
[18:28] know it's Bitcoin or the Bitcoin brag um
[18:33] uh bag goody bag has uh the the BR um as
[18:38] a city on there and then on the left
[18:41] side 21 and then on the right side M
[18:43] it's just so subtle if you're not in
[18:45] Bitcoin you never know that's a Bitcoin
[18:47] thing but if you are in Bitcoin then you
[18:49] notice it that oh 21 million ah
[18:52] interesting it's a Bitcoin thing so I
[18:53] like that kind of art a lot where you
[18:56] notice as a Bitcoin that's Bitcoin but
[18:59] outside of the Bitcoin Community you
[19:01] don't really notice it you don't really
[19:03] know it and I think that's for the
[19:05] people that want to wear it but have
[19:07] maybe security concerns or don't want to
[19:09] be uh interrupted in the day and like oh
[19:12] are you are you are you from Bitcoin
[19:15] yeah 100% And I I like to think that
[19:17] we've covered all the bases there so
[19:19] from really really bold options to the
[19:21] really really covert to make sure that
[19:24] there's something for everyone's Comfort
[19:25] level very cool very cool um a different
[19:28] question um you you'd have graphic
[19:32] designs now you have an an apparel brand
[19:36] um how do you think on on a Bitcoin
[19:38] standard if you now think like 50
[19:41] hundred years out and we have this sound
[19:43] money standard where like people like
[19:45] think long term um how do you think the
[19:49] the the designing could change I see it
[19:52] a lot with like I'm not in Vienna and
[19:54] you can see really nicely that is old
[19:57] beautiful buildings with like a lot of
[19:59] details and a lot of really nice things
[20:02] and then there's these new things that's
[20:03] it's just like oh it's a glass block in
[20:06] the middle of Vienna or it's a glass
[20:08] tower and it's I guess it's preference
[20:12] but I really like the old buildings I'm
[20:14] also now in old building so if I go
[20:16] around the floor it's creaks everywhere
[20:18] and I love it uh and it's like this uh
[20:21] this tall uh doors and it's like small
[20:24] little things in the doors and it's it's
[20:27] just with May way more love and in
[20:29] detail so I I really like that kind of a
[20:33] style uh could you envision to that we
[20:36] actually go back to this more detailed
[20:39] more loving more uh U yeah more detailed
[20:43] uh designings I love this question it's
[20:47] it's it comes right it goes right to my
[20:49] heart so I'm a big fan of vintage
[20:51] clothing in slow fashion um so I would
[20:55] definitely love to see it go that way
[20:57] but I think it can go one of two ways or
[21:00] maybe it could go in both directions is
[21:04] it could go back to slow that people are
[21:06] buying things um classic Styles getting
[21:09] them you know made to a really good
[21:11] quality um keeping them mending them
[21:14] extending the life all that sort of
[21:16] thing but then there's also um about I
[21:21] think it's let me think give me a sec I
[21:25] think
[21:26] 85% of the world
[21:29] uh garbage um is created by the fashion
[21:33] industry and one in five items of
[21:37] clothing is sent to the to the tip
[21:40] before um without even being worn once
[21:43] so it's there's a massive amount of um
[21:47] trash that comes from the fashion
[21:49] industry and one of the things that um
[21:52] the Bitcoin Diaries does is it's print
[21:54] on demand so there's no wastage you're
[21:57] you're basically once you've ordered
[21:59] something then it gets made for you and
[22:01] and sent out so there's there's just
[22:05] there's there's two there's a there's
[22:06] two ways that could be beneficial so
[22:10] because when you've got those things
[22:11] that are made really well but they don't
[22:12] get sold um they'll end up in the tip so
[22:17] it's yeah what do you do thank you you
[22:19] already made it halfway through the
[22:21] video and I'm really really grateful to
[22:23] have you here two things make this
[22:25] channel possible you as a watcher and
[22:28] listener who keep supporting this
[22:30] Channel and another one is all the
[22:32] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[22:34] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[22:37] very start and where I personally buy my
[22:39] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[22:41] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[22:43] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[22:46] simplest and securest way to secure your
[22:49] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[22:51] only two% of bitcoiners hold their
[22:54] Bitcoin in a hardware wallet how crazy
[22:56] is that don't be in that 98% bracket be
[23:00] in the 2% bracket and if you have self-
[23:02] custody and you know your friend does
[23:04] not have maybe he needs a Christmas
[23:06] present maybe he needs a bir of present
[23:08] and a small life hack if you use code
[23:10] Robin you get 5% off your order plus you
[23:13] support my channel and now let's get
[23:16] back to the video 85% what that's a
[23:19] really high number with with when you
[23:20] have like a lot of uh trash and and then
[23:24] people uh trash on bitcoin's environment
[23:27] impact
[23:29] but there are so many other things that
[23:31] like Bitcoin is actually useful for
[23:34] using the energy and then we use so much
[23:36] energy because I think a lot of it comes
[23:39] down to the field world and also um when
[23:42] I see Sci-Fi movies and there's like
[23:46] people from the future coming or aliens
[23:48] are coming they always coming like one
[23:50] suit they always have like all all have
[23:52] the same cloes I I always wonder like
[23:55] are we at one point as a civilization on
[23:58] Earth just deci deciding oh yes we will
[24:00] wear this thing and everyone will wear
[24:03] that I hope not by the way yeah no
[24:07] freedom of expression is definitely
[24:08] something I'd like to keep definitely
[24:11] definitely did you had actually any
[24:13] other uh challenges while you were uh
[24:17] coming up with the Bitcoin business or
[24:19] anything that like was really
[24:21] challenging uh for you when you had this
[24:24] uh thing starting from
[24:27] nowhere so sorry just cut out there for
[24:29] a second I was just asking if uh if you
[24:32] had any other uh you you see me and hear
[24:36] me again yep you're
[24:39] back perfect perfect perfect um I was
[24:43] just asking if you have any encounters
[24:46] or issues with uh when you started the
[24:48] Bitcoin business with uh I don't know
[24:50] regulatories or like you you had to
[24:53] start something were were there any
[24:55] learning curves uh to that or any issues
[24:57] that you had along the way
[24:59] probably um let me think about it
[25:02] technically like with all the um with
[25:04] all the tech I've definitely had some
[25:06] struggles i u ended up using woocommerce
[25:10] instead of Shopify and found that it's
[25:12] very very complex um in comparison so
[25:16] I've got help with a um developer who's
[25:19] helping me with a few things at the
[25:21] moment um and it's got to a point where
[25:25] the website's gone Way Beyond my my um
[25:30] like an like an easy thing to use it's
[25:32] not it's not user friendly for me
[25:34] anymore so that's that's definitely
[25:37] something that had like you know had
[25:40] I had had I sort of not started with
[25:43] woomer I probably would have swayed
[25:44] toward towards Shopify and to see if
[25:47] that would be an easier um easier path
[25:50] what else the fact that it's Fe like
[25:52] that it it's directed to females is a
[25:54] huge huge challenge because there's um
[25:58] there's not a lot active in the
[25:59] community it means that it's um so the
[26:02] amount of bitcoiners that are out there
[26:04] um in the world is still pretty small
[26:08] and the percentage of women in that
[26:10] bitcoiner Community is smaller still so
[26:13] my challenge is finding them getting you
[26:15] know connecting with them um sort of
[26:19] letting them know about the brand and
[26:20] what you know what we've got to offer
[26:23] and then convincing them that that it's
[26:25] something that they'd um love to be a
[26:27] part of so the the whole
[26:32] um direction of the business is a
[26:35] challenge in itself I can imagine
[26:37] because we are in a really really small
[26:39] part of the world with Bitcoin in
[26:41] general but then we have uh when you
[26:45] take like there's like this Finance
[26:47] bubble then there's this crypto bubble
[26:49] then there's the Bitcoin only bubble and
[26:51] in the Bitcoin only paddle you chose
[26:53] only the the females so it's like a
[26:55] really really really Niche Niche thing
[26:58] feel like some but but I feel like it's
[27:00] it's one of the one of the other big
[27:03] challenges sorry oh go go ahead
[27:07] hello oh um one of the other big
[27:09] challenges is that the um the price of
[27:13] Bitcoin changes the spending habits of
[27:15] bitcoiners so um it's basic the the yeah
[27:20] the spending habits are are going to
[27:21] chop and change depending on how you
[27:24] know if you know we're going high low
[27:27] crab walks it's yeah every Everything
[27:30] affects sales so that's that's a massive
[27:32] challenge I've seen it in uh in my
[27:35] content whenever the Bitcoin price does
[27:38] something I get more views more
[27:40] subscribers More Everything uh when the
[27:42] Bitcoin price does nothing it's kind of
[27:45] it still grows it still go does his
[27:47] thing and still people watch but just
[27:49] not as much like the excitement is
[27:51] definitely here when the price does
[27:53] something which is interesting to see
[27:56] that that like yes when the price moves
[27:58] then people Google it people search it
[28:00] people watch it and the price does
[28:02] nothing and I've seen it with um I I've
[28:06] spoken with Hardware wallet uh CEOs I
[28:09] spoken with exchange CEOs and they all
[28:12] say the same thing when the price moves
[28:14] up and down sales go up and the price
[28:17] moves sideways sales sometimes even go
[28:20] down and and they they notice those uh
[28:23] moves a lot and it's it's it's Bitcoin
[28:26] is an interesting uh business Venture
[28:28] when you're here and when you when you
[28:30] do something how did you actually came
[28:33] into Bitcoin how did you uh come and
[28:36] discover Bitcoin um I was working at a
[28:39] bank in
[28:40] Australia um as a graphic designer on
[28:43] the anti-money laundering and
[28:45] counterterrorism financing
[28:47] program and um so I was reading a bunch
[28:50] of Finance articles whilst I was doing
[28:52] um design work there and I stumbled
[28:55] across some articles about Bitcoin and
[28:58] and because I was working on the anti
[29:00] money laundering program I knew that the
[29:04] the laws were getting stricter and
[29:05] stricter for customers um with um know
[29:09] your customer and um how much how much
[29:11] detail you need to give them to open up
[29:14] a bank account um and knowing that in um
[29:18] developing nations those sorts of things
[29:20] just aren't possible and it just makes
[29:21] it harder and harder for them to um
[29:25] transfer their money um and then having
[29:27] to use use um more expensive options to
[29:31] get money back home and things like that
[29:33] so straight away I've gone oh there's a
[29:36] market for this it's definitely going to
[29:38] um fill a gap and it's going to change
[29:41] lives and things like that and then the
[29:43] other reason was because um back at Uni
[29:47] I had a I had a boyfriend from Albania
[29:49] and he was a student who often um needed
[29:53] funds from family to help him help him
[29:55] out and we had to go to Western Union
[29:58] and Money Gram and things like that you
[30:00] had to bring your passport you had to
[30:01] wait until the place was open you had to
[30:03] wait two weeks um it just was like the
[30:06] ridiculous amount of time and effort
[30:08] just to get money from A to B so I like
[30:11] as soon as I started reading about
[30:13] Bitcoin I was like yep I mean this is
[30:15] you know this is great however I wasn't
[30:18] very financially Savvy and I didn't um
[30:21] think of Bitcoin as um something
[30:24] worthwhile investing in I was just like
[30:27] yep I'm glad it's around but do I um I
[30:30] didn't have any friends or connections
[30:31] that were that were into Bitcoin either
[30:34] so it wasn't until last year when I
[30:37] started this when I started the project
[30:40] I announced it on my social media and
[30:42] out out of the Woodworks um I had some
[30:44] friends come in come in touch with me
[30:46] one who was um helping me as an adviser
[30:48] for the website and then it turned out
[30:50] that his cousin was a a tax agent for
[30:53] crypto and from then on it was just like
[30:55] pop pop pop pop all of these people um
[30:58] popping up in my life that's saying yep
[31:00] I'm into this and um and uh yeah so and
[31:04] now I'm here amazing I also see a lot
[31:06] that uh Bitcoin even changes lives and
[31:09] like gives gives your life a differenta
[31:12] trajectory all of a sudden was it also
[31:14] for you like something that like
[31:16] definitely changed the the the direction
[31:18] of your life or did it change anything
[31:20] else uh I think my life has pretty like
[31:23] changed a fair bit over the last couple
[31:25] of years anyway but I but more than
[31:28] anything it's it's the connections that
[31:30] I'm making and the people that I'm
[31:31] spending time with
[31:33] so like I've got a um a catch up that I
[31:37] have with um a bunch of beautiful women
[31:40] who are um Living in America um every
[31:43] single Wednesday well for them it's
[31:45] Tuesday every single Wednesday and we
[31:47] get together we discuss business we
[31:48] discuss life and things like that and
[31:51] and this is just um grown from I think
[31:56] it was like a Twitter um a guy on
[31:58] Twitter found me and he's like just
[31:59] connect with this lady and then it it
[32:02] turns out that I'm making these amazing
[32:04] friends out of nothing so a tiny little
[32:07] um Twitter conversation has turned into
[32:09] me connecting with these these beautiful
[32:13] people and they're now I would consider
[32:15] good friends in in the matter of you
[32:18] know a matter of a few months so it's
[32:21] it's definitely showing me um a
[32:23] different kind of strength in connection
[32:26] that um that happens when you're
[32:29] interacting with Bitcoin is yeah it's I
[32:32] love what uh what the Bitcoin Community
[32:35] right now is uh it's such a a big nice
[32:39] and supportive place where you can do a
[32:42] lot of different stuff and uh yeah it's
[32:44] it's a great great place to be right now
[32:46] I feel like um do uh my my end routine
[32:51] question before we come to the actual
[32:52] tine is always like uh what you are
[32:55] currently passionate about besides
[32:57] Bitcoin and the the aim for this
[33:00] question is always uh bitcoiners are
[33:02] really interesting and I think we should
[33:05] learn from each other so what are you
[33:07] currently passionate about uh besides
[33:10] Bitcoin and besides your Bitcoin
[33:13] business I would say my family that's
[33:16] probably the one thing that's become H
[33:18] like hugely passionate about um I've
[33:20] moved back with my family about two
[33:24] years ago um and um I'm now closer to um
[33:29] my siblings I'm one of five kids so um
[33:33] I'm now closer to a lot of them which I
[33:34] means I get to spend a whole bunch of
[33:36] time with them and their children as
[33:38] well um I love my dogs that's part of
[33:40] the family as well so yeah I'd say the
[33:44] the biggest passion that I have at the
[33:46] moment is just being involved with them
[33:48] and enjoying the time that we have to to
[33:52] spend
[33:53] together I love that answer family comes
[33:56] actually up as a lot of times in the
[33:59] answers with that and I lot of that
[34:01] about the Bitcoin Community it seems
[34:03] like uh Bitcoin supports uh those uh
[34:07] great family values and and brings the
[34:10] the people back to to the the the yeah
[34:14] to those Family Values I love it a lot
[34:17] um we have an end routine in the podcast
[34:19] where the the previous guest is asking a
[34:21] question uh for the next guest without
[34:23] knowing who the next guest actually is
[34:26] and it's an interesting question that uh
[34:27] that you got um who do you think needs
[34:31] Bitcoin the most but doesn't realize it
[34:34] yet oh man
[34:37] um who does it I would
[34:43] say the upand cominging generations so
[34:46] like gen Zed
[34:50] um I don't know what what it's like in
[34:53] other countries but in Australia there's
[34:56] there hasn't been much talk about it in
[34:58] in those in those years where um the
[35:01] idea of owning a home in Australia is
[35:04] now near impossible I think the the
[35:07] numbers
[35:08] were you for the for the kids in school
[35:12] now you're going to have to wait 48
[35:17] years before you can afford um a
[35:21] mortgage for a property in Sydney um and
[35:24] 18 to 22 years if you're wanting to buy
[35:27] an a apartment and it's just yeah
[35:31] whether or not they know it know they
[35:33] need it or not I'm not so sure but
[35:35] they're definitely the ones who need it
[35:36] the
[35:38] most yes and it's great because I'm
[35:40] generous uh Genet
[35:46] actually so so I hope I can I can get uh
[35:50] some of mine but it's interesting
[35:51] because I look at my statistics in my
[35:54] YouTube and the average viewer on this
[35:57] YouTube channel is like around 50 years
[35:59] old uh and I he have even above 65 years
[36:05] old I have like 12 15% of my subscribers
[36:08] are like that uh old uh which is
[36:11] interesting because there are more
[36:13] people above 65 than under 25 which is
[36:17] my current age so even though I'm I'm
[36:20] I'm pretty young a lot of um uh later
[36:24] stage uh people actually follow me and
[36:26] and and and you my my stuff uh which is
[36:29] amazing to see that all the people have
[36:32] like this openness and this humility to
[36:33] just like listen to even young people
[36:36] and see what what they're up to and it's
[36:39] it's I think just it's it's it's really
[36:40] great that the Bitcoin Community just uh
[36:43] grew up uh in this in in this world and
[36:46] it's not something oh it's a new thing
[36:49] nerdy thing but yes we are actually
[36:51] growing up we're getting in
[36:52] institutional money we're getting on
[36:54] Country level we're getting in all those
[36:56] different things that
[36:58] uh biton is is is is is good for so yeah
