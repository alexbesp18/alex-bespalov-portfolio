[00:00] there's no way to overtake the network
[00:01] you cannot change Bitcoin Bitcoin
[00:03] changes you if you can't explain it then
[00:04] you don't understand it it's simple as
[00:06] that it's been under development for
[00:08] over 50 years it's crazy and this is the
[00:12] most Hightech thing that we have created
[00:14] what do you think will be the most
[00:16] bullish thing that can happen in the
[00:18] next
[00:19] cycle you are the founder of the love is
[00:23] Bitcoin magazine uh and I think a lot of
[00:26] people still don't know that love is
[00:28] Bitcoin Twitter and Twitter handle is
[00:31] actually not uh just one person it's a
[00:34] team it's a magazine it's it's something
[00:35] bigger than just one person and it's
[00:38] always interesting for me that when
[00:40] people uh found something when people
[00:42] start something in the Bitcoin
[00:44] Community um and they're doing it uh for
[00:48] the greater purpose and you did it in
[00:51] the best way possible I think you put uh
[00:54] a brand out there with excluding
[00:57] yourself like you founded it but you did
[00:59] not put your name uh on top of it it's a
[01:03] lest Bitcoin uh magazine and you even
[01:06] put a character a female character named
[01:09] Libby on there and you put not yourself
[01:12] on there like uh first of all like why
[01:14] did you do that and did not push
[01:17] yourself in the process uh and why did
[01:20] you start the love is Bitcoin in
[01:23] general yeah uh well first of all it it
[01:27] happened by accident I was just 3 years
[01:31] ago I was just trying to play with
[01:33] lightning just figuring out the
[01:36] capabilities of uh the lightning
[01:39] applications what what websites we could
[01:41] use for those things I was really
[01:43] excited about it and things were
[01:47] really uh let's say at the infant level
[01:51] so there were no not that many services
[01:54] it was not that reliable we didn't have
[01:56] many applic as many applications as we
[01:59] have right now so I was just trying to
[02:02] do a capture basically on uh the
[02:06] lightning basically if you have SATs to
[02:09] pay with lightning you can go through
[02:12] that site and uh I have many websites
[02:16] and the site that I tried was a dating
[02:19] site so I decided to just register a
[02:23] domain loveis bitcoin.com and I just
[02:27] bought um a turn key
[02:30] application TurnKey application is
[02:33] basically a program a website where you
[02:36] just have it running on your server and
[02:39] it works out of the box you just change
[02:41] the names everything and it works so I
[02:45] got a turnkey dating site just for fun
[02:47] and I said okay bitcoiners uh let's
[02:50] exclude everyone who isn't a lightning
[02:52] user and let's make a Bitcoin dating
[02:56] site so I just Dro that there just as a
[02:59] proof of concept because that's how I
[03:01] work I have I've had about 100 websites
[03:05] up until now for like 15 years now and I
[03:09] do that I try something I abandon
[03:11] projects I start other projects uh it's
[03:14] a constant thing for me and at some
[03:17] point as soon as I posted about it uh I
[03:21] went to the beach basically one day and
[03:25] Peter mccormac uh shared it making fun
[03:28] of it obviously because okay it's funny
[03:32] that we need a dating site for
[03:33] bitcoiners or whatever and I was at the
[03:36] beach and I came back to find it had
[03:39] like 5,000 uh clicks 5,000 visitors
[03:43] people were trying to log in of course
[03:45] it didn't work the lightning filter
[03:47] basically didn't work the lightning
[03:48] login and people were commenting about
[03:51] it so okay I said okay
[03:54] let's have that running on its own um I
[03:58] have uh I've I'm working with social
[04:02] media managers so I had my social media
[04:05] media manager at that time I gave here
[04:07] some instructions I gave here some posts
[04:10] some uh artwork that was some artwork
[04:15] that was nice and I told her okay you
[04:19] know handle that account and I forgot
[04:21] about it because three years ago I was
[04:24] not a Bitcoin
[04:25] maximalist uh until then and I decided
[04:30] to work on other projects write stuff
[04:32] you know things like that and basically
[04:36] at some point they started get getting a
[04:38] lot of traction and I started to like it
[04:41] a a lot so I ripped out the dating site
[04:47] basically which obviously was a failure
[04:49] but I never bothered much with that like
[04:51] I said it was just uh turn key
[04:54] application I dropped it there and then
[04:56] I just removed it and I decided to turn
[04:58] it into a magazine
[05:00] now what most of you have seen is the
[05:03] liby character liby is a fictional
[05:07] character she's like a Bitcoin Barbie
[05:10] basically and the latest implementation
[05:14] of liby is uh with Florencia with Flo
[05:18] Montoya and you've had her before on
[05:21] your show she told us all about that and
[05:25] so I I asked her do you want to be the
[05:28] face of this because my earlier social
[05:31] media manager was not a bitcoiner and
[05:34] she didn't want to be uh public
[05:37] basically representing the brand so Flo
[05:41] was perfect for that and we started
[05:44] working and working and working and it's
[05:46] been like um eight seven eight months
[05:49] now and it worked perfectly to the
[05:52] result that you see right now what the
[05:55] goal is for all this is to create
[05:58] basically a nonperson personal brand
[06:00] because liby is a character it's not a
[06:03] person and we are using a lot of people
[06:07] behind that to Showcase uh what we do
[06:12] and to show Bitcoin Brands and to spread
[06:15] basically the Bitcoin
[06:18] message that's in short Robin that's an
[06:21] amazing story I like it a lot and uh for
[06:24] me the obvious question to ask now is
[06:27] like will the dating site uh come back
[06:30] on the L no no no no way no forget about
[06:34] that I don't I'm not doing that again I
[06:36] I told you it
[06:38] was just to add a little bit of that I
[06:41] as I told you I try out a few things so
[06:44] I wanted to try out lightning that was
[06:46] it lightning capture basically can you
[06:49] pay like 21 SATs on for this page if you
[06:52] have 21 SATs on your lightning wallet to
[06:55] pay for that you can go through it's
[06:57] just a pay wall but it was just a filter
[07:00] and when you create a site you have to
[07:01] put something behind I could have put my
[07:03] own books for example I could have said
[07:05] here's my book online you can read it
[07:08] for free it but it's not free you need
[07:10] to pay a minuscule amount of 21 SATs
[07:13] with your lightning wallet just to prove
[07:15] that you're a bitcoiner basically but
[07:17] three years ago we didn't have all these
[07:20] wallets right now we have an explosion
[07:22] of wallets we have Aqua wallet we have
[07:24] wallet of Satoshi we have ALB which is
[07:26] amazing we have Phoenix we have
[07:29] an an amazing number of wallets I on my
[07:32] phone I have like 14 15 different
[07:34] wallets lightning wallets for different
[07:37] reasons okay I I like to try out things
[07:40] but we have a lot of options right now
[07:42] and they work they work right now but
[07:45] three years ago they didn't work that
[07:47] well so I was trying to to write to use
[07:50] a node to use a lightning node to do put
[07:53] the lightning pay wall and things like
[07:55] that so I just decided okay why not
[07:57] let's put a filter prove you're a
[07:59] bitcoiner pay with lightning 21 sets and
[08:02] you get access to the dating site
[08:05] basically uh and like I said it was it
[08:07] was just a turn key app uh it was just
[08:10] there just as a proof of concept um so
[08:13] it's not going to come back no
[08:15] sorry it's uh that's that's a dead
[08:18] project and we I pivoted the entire
[08:21] thing I moved the entire thing into a
[08:24] magazine and it's going really well we
[08:27] have uh over 10 authors
[08:29] right now writing on the love is Bitcoin
[08:32] magazine uh you can check it out you can
[08:36] browse a lot of the authors for example
[08:38] we have Bitcoin filmfest who are very
[08:40] creative and just from them we have like
[08:44] three or four authors writing all the
[08:46] time and you can get a lot of things a
[08:50] lot of the Bitcoin culture basically on
[08:54] the love is Bitcoin uh account and on
[08:56] the website with we just launched
[09:00] we relaunched it basically the podcast
[09:03] the heartbeat podcast I tried that a
[09:06] year ago uh I did the same um mistake
[09:11] you could say um because Eleonora the
[09:14] the earlier Hostess while she was a
[09:17] professional and she was amazing just
[09:19] like my first liby who was a
[09:21] professional social media manager and
[09:23] she was amazing too they are they
[09:26] weren't bitcoiners they weren't
[09:28] bitcoiners
[09:29] and the difference is night and day the
[09:33] difference is enormous the when you work
[09:36] with bitcoiners it's completely
[09:38] different they get the
[09:41] the not not the brand they get the
[09:44] message they get the the
[09:47] vision um when I talk to Florencia for
[09:50] example because we chat all the time
[09:52] constantly uh every day with minor
[09:56] things with marketing with uh posts with
[09:59] answering DMS and things like that we're
[10:01] on the same
[10:02] page she's like oh I did this and I
[10:06] laugh and I say yes that was amazing and
[10:10] uh oh you could do that as well and oh
[10:13] you can make fun of that and comment to
[10:15] that guy and she goes ahead and does it
[10:18] and it's funny and it gets like a
[10:20] hundred reactions and it becomes a meme
[10:24] so it's we're on the same page it's
[10:26] completely different working with
[10:28] someone who is is a professional but is
[10:30] also a bitcoiner and they get your
[10:33] vision and because you asked me and I
[10:35] haven't gotten to that yet my vision for
[10:38] this for love is Bitcoin brand is
[10:41] basically to to bring in the people the
[10:45] mainstream people but in a good way not
[10:48] in a in a Wizards way not in the Bitcoin
[10:52] Wizards way and the ordinal way where we
[10:55] bring the the coiny thing into
[10:59] Bitcoin that's not the point the point
[11:01] is to find the people who want to learn
[11:06] about Bitcoin and with catchy phrases
[11:10] like not your keys not your coins we we
[11:13] show these to people we have Florencia
[11:16] doing videos doing um various memes we
[11:20] repeat the message we've posted it a
[11:22] thousand times and we're going to post
[11:24] it a thousand more times that this is
[11:27] what you have to do you have to focus on
[11:29] self- custody you have to focus on
[11:32] getting your keys out of the exchange
[11:34] why do you need that okay I will point
[11:37] you to an article but first make it
[11:39] funny first make it uh interesting uh
[11:42] and why not have a pretty girl telling
[11:44] you this because that's how you get um a
[11:48] lot more people paying attention Okay
[11:51] it's uh a simple marketing trick but it
[11:54] works and Florencia is not just a pretty
[11:57] face uh you've seen it through the
[11:59] interview and you can go back and check
[12:02] out Robin Sear's interview with Floren
[12:05] uh that happened like a month ago you
[12:08] can see that she has a lot to say she
[12:10] knows about Bitcoin she may not be that
[12:13] technical but she has a great um opinion
[12:17] on how Bitcoin can help people in in
[12:21] real life not we're not talking about
[12:23] nfts we're not talking about defi or
[12:26] whatever we're talking about remittances
[12:28] about about saving people who have a
[12:31] problem with hyperinflation and escaping
[12:35] that problem in their country it can
[12:37] help people like in
[12:39] Argentina who have a collapsing currency
[12:43] and things like that so everybody in my
[12:46] team gets it the heartbeat uh podcast
[12:50] like I mentioned for example we just
[12:52] started that Dany is the hostess she is
[12:56] a computer scientist she is a filmmaker
[12:59] she's a mother and she's an amazing
[13:02] person and I can't wait for all of you
[13:04] to meet her and we are doing the same
[13:08] thing we're explaining uh Bitcoin we're
[13:11] explaining what is happening we go some
[13:14] in some episodes we go into the deeply
[13:16] technical stuff in other episodes we
[13:19] just talk about books and because she's
[13:21] a mother and for example she uses the
[13:25] shamori books for her child she will
[13:29] demonstrate and show you how you can
[13:32] teach your kid to use the the games and
[13:36] the books from the from these uh
[13:39] companies that have amazing uh material
[13:43] that you can use to entertain your kids
[13:46] and educate them so that's the goal
[13:48] that's our ethos basically and every
[13:52] single person on the team is a bitcoiner
[13:55] and they're focused on getting the word
[13:58] out basically orange pilling more people
[14:00] that's an amazing journey because uh I
[14:03] think that uh Bitcoin teams are better
[14:05] than non Bitcoin teams in general and
[14:09] it's it's uh really good that you now
[14:12] have bitcoiners in place of this
[14:14] important um positions where it's Libby
[14:18] is um is filled with Flo and I as you
[14:21] said I interviewed Flo and she's amazing
[14:23] she is doing really really good she
[14:25] understands Bitcoin and the fundamental
[14:27] core uh and she's doing a great job
[14:30] explaining and also that because this is
[14:32] not easy uh getting Bitcoin and being
[14:35] able to explain Bitcoin or do different
[14:37] things in my opinion and she can do both
[14:40] and that is is amazing um so not only
[14:43] having like a a pretty uh bit Bitcoin
[14:47] Barbie as a phase because this is easy
[14:49] there are a lot of pretty girls out
[14:50] there but there are not a lot of pretty
[14:52] girls out there that actually also get
[14:54] Bitcoin and can explain it so that's uh
[14:56] it's an amazing uh asset to to have on
[14:59] on your team so congratulations on on on
[15:01] that one um and this is also where my
[15:05] question is going a little bit how did
[15:07] you go ahead and build your uh Bitcoin
[15:10] team also now with Danny and how big is
[15:13] the whole uh your Bitcoin team and also
[15:16] maybe in that question do you have other
[15:18] Ventures that you're also staring or
[15:21] also um managing right now and how do
[15:24] you go about that whole thing um well
[15:27] let's answer the question about the team
[15:29] first the team it depends on how you
[15:31] count how you measure it depends on uh
[15:35] how you define it basically the core
[15:37] team you could say it's like five people
[15:40] of the love is Bitcoin team the extended
[15:43] team if you count the authors if you
[15:45] count some partners that we have the
[15:48] film making team right now which is Dany
[15:50] and uh another person two more people if
[15:53] you count all of them it's like 15
[15:55] people so it's on and off some people uh
[15:58] help for a specific project some people
[16:02] might have an ongoing help um some
[16:06] people might uh for example for the
[16:08] Santorini Hing party we have a Greek
[16:10] team right now it's uh based in Athens
[16:14] and we're going to go to Santorini and
[16:16] celebrate the the haling with all our
[16:19] friends there uh and our online friends
[16:22] and some guests who will become friends
[16:25] when we meet them there so the Greek
[16:27] team the Santorini team for example is a
[16:30] separate team basically because these
[16:32] people aren't always on the love is
[16:35] Bitcoin team but you if you define it uh
[16:39] as such yeah it's like four to 15 people
[16:43] depending on the scenario which is crazy
[16:46] which is crazy I understand um I am a
[16:49] businessman and I do create these things
[16:53] but I'm very excited but of the
[16:56] reception basically people want want to
[16:59] work with this they they keep saying oh
[17:02] I love what you're doing and they say I
[17:05] want to be a part of this um we just
[17:08] created for example a clothe line okay
[17:12] basically a Bitcoin merch line because I
[17:15] don't want to handle that myself I
[17:18] always follow the parto rule of doing
[17:21] 20% of the work to get 80% of the
[17:25] benefit I prefer to have someone else
[17:27] who already has a a T-shirt and a merch
[17:31] shop to handle all the logistics and all
[17:34] these things and I will just do the
[17:36] marketing and send people there and come
[17:38] up with designs and ideas so uh the our
[17:42] partner right now which is Bitcoin
[17:44] Diaries um liby orange ped her and it
[17:49] just happened like a few months ago she
[17:51] was crypto and she was doing a bit of
[17:55]  coiny things and at some point she
[17:58] DM uh Flo and she said like I've been
[18:01] following you and uh I believe in what
[18:05] you're saying I managed to to see the
[18:08] light and now I've shifted my brand I
[18:12] I'm Bitcoin only now and here something
[18:15] nice here something uh feminine cute
[18:18] that you can share and so we started the
[18:21] partnership and right now the love is
[18:23] Bitcoin t-shirts and designs and things
[18:27] like that they go through the Bitcoin
[18:29] Diaries shop which you can go there by
[18:31] the way at Bitcoin Diaries and find the
[18:34] lest Bitcoin connection collection sorry
[18:37] and use and buy all those t-shirts that
[18:41] you see Floren wearing as Libby when
[18:44] you're when she's traveling and when
[18:47] she's uh you know being cute at home
[18:51] it's amazing and uh for for like the the
[18:54] question like um what else are you doing
[18:57] in in in the Bitcoin scene or is it like
[19:00] mainly the bit love is Bitcoin magazine
[19:03] I saw some other projects also in your
[19:05] your biography I do a lot of things I do
[19:07] a lot of things to be honest I have like
[19:11] uh five businesses right now but so
[19:14] they're not all Bitcoin related right
[19:17] now my the most passionate one is
[19:20] working for the love is Bitcoin business
[19:23] because it's so rewarding I meet so many
[19:26] people there are like I told you the
[19:29] team is expanding it's becoming more and
[19:31] more demanding even though I try to
[19:34] delegate a lot of the tasks and uh
[19:38] basically I I have focused my efforts on
[19:43] my Bitcoin uh businesses I also tried to
[19:47] write a few things I've written a few
[19:49] articles about Bitcoin some
[19:52] guides possibly some fiction which is um
[19:56] it's going to be published at some point
[19:59] so if you all the Bitcoin things that
[20:03] I'm doing is basically Bitcoin fiction
[20:05] Bitcoin uh articles I did some artwork
[20:09] uh like a couple of years ago but um I'm
[20:13] not in the mood to generate a lot more
[20:15] from that to be honest for example yeah
[20:18] this is like a t-shirt that I designed
[20:20] it's a it's a 3D design and uh I'm not
[20:24] really in the mood to make that uh into
[20:26] a full-time thing I also teach a few
[20:28] Bitcoin workshops in Greece in Athens
[20:32] and that has been very rewarding because
[20:35] you can see the immediate impact it has
[20:38] on people um my students they will not
[20:42] let me go the the every lesson is 3
[20:45] hours long and we have a 10minute break
[20:50] and they won't let me do do the break
[20:54] they keep asking me things and when the
[20:57] lesson is over
[20:58] uh for like 30 or 40 minutes after we
[21:02] were standing in the middle of the
[21:04] street with like two or three guys and
[21:06] talking about Bitcoin and they keep
[21:08] asking me things and they want they want
[21:10] to learn they want to learn and the most
[21:13] important thing is the impact that you
[21:15] see having on people because the I've
[21:18] worked in two Bitcoin workshops one was
[21:21] in partnership with a
[21:23] crypto basically private uh College
[21:27] let's call it
[21:28] and uh those are were Traders you know
[21:32] asking about how to do these def things
[21:36] or whatever and I managed to orange pill
[21:38] at least three or four of them by the
[21:40] end of uh the lessons we did like four
[21:44] lessons and by the end of the lessons
[21:46] they were oh I'm going to start a node
[21:48] oh I got a hardware wallet uh I'm going
[21:51] to self- custody my my keys I'm going to
[21:55] focus on bitcoin so I managed to orange
[21:58] pill a lot of them so it has been very
[22:01] rewarding um and you see the real life
[22:03] impact that it has there's a guy who
[22:06] came to me after the lessons and he had
[22:09] his uh his daughter she was like two
[22:12] years old and he had her with with him
[22:16] and he told me I have saved up in Cold
[22:18] Storage just like you said and uh it's
[22:21] for my kid and she can have them she can
[22:24] have the SATs in 15 years you can
[22:27] imagine how much value that amount will
[22:31] have in 15 years right it can probably
[22:35] pay for her University can pay for
[22:38] pretty much anything that she wants to
[22:40] do when she becomes like 17 18 um so it
[22:44] has a real life impact that's the
[22:46] important thing and that has been very
[22:49] very
[22:50] rewarding uh as for my I've I've tried
[22:53] to publish some books I've written an
[22:56] orange pilling guide and um now I'm
[22:59] working on a a guide on how to do
[23:03] Bitcoin workshops basically just write
[23:06] down my my experience and the things
[23:09] that uh I've learned basically in case
[23:12] you want to read that and do your own
[23:14] Workshop I'm super excited to announce
[23:17] that this podcast got the first ever
[23:21] sponsor 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from
[23:24] day one and they teach and preach
[23:27] selfcast
[23:28] this is my goto exchange when someone
[23:31] asks me oh where can I buy my Bitcoin
[23:33] from this is the easiest entry for
[23:36] bitcoiners and if you want lower fees
[23:39] Plus at the same time support this
[23:41] podcast use code Robin and click the
[23:44] link in the description that's amazing
[23:46] uh and I think also um uh it's so
[23:49] rewarding to work inside of Bitcoin
[23:52] whatever this means like you work as a
[23:54] content creator you work as like maybe a
[23:57] lightning w wallet um um producer like
[24:00] you're developing stuff you working
[24:02] Bitcoin core you whatever you're doing
[24:04] in Bitcoin uh you are creating future
[24:07] value because this thing is just
[24:09] starting out and it will become such a
[24:12] huge um instrumental thing for our whole
[24:16] lives so uh I think just looking at
[24:19] through that lens it's extremely
[24:21] rewarding and in the same time we can
[24:23] even see changes now like I come from
[24:28] normal feed world where I'm working uh
[24:31] in a company and actually I'm was quite
[24:34] lucky because this company was amazing
[24:36] uh what I heard from other friends and
[24:38] other colleagues there were like Works
[24:40] related with normal jobs that were
[24:42] really really bad I was in an amazing
[24:44] environment I could grow there a lot I
[24:46] can do there a lot it was amazing but
[24:49] the topic was cyber security and not
[24:51] Bitcoin and I wanted to be in Bitcoin
[24:52] even though cyber security would have
[24:54] been my second choice if there was no no
[24:56] Bitcoin uh and for me Bitcoin was such
[25:00] an rewarding thing to to do and I see
[25:03] also changes in the behavior and the
[25:05] methods how people work inside of
[25:07] Bitcoin and you now in a really unique
[25:09] position where you manage companies and
[25:12] projects uh which are Bitcoin only for
[25:15] example the L is Bitcoin where the
[25:17] people working there are probably all
[25:20] bitcoiners as you said uh and you also
[25:23] have non-bitcoin related work do you see
[25:26] a difference there in in the the people
[25:28] working there in the passion in the in
[25:31] the excitement also in like the the
[25:34] behaviors of of of the the work
[25:36] colleagues there or is it like just like
[25:39] a normal project it's a huge difference
[25:41] basically you can separate you can you
[25:43] can drive like a straight line between
[25:47] Fiat world and Bitcoin world it's about
[25:50] the time preference thing what uh cedin
[25:53] keeps saying with a Time preference
[25:55] thing it requires your brain literally I
[25:58] think it has a neurological changes
[26:01] that's why being orange pilled is such a
[26:03] revelation it changes the way you think
[26:06] about things that's why we go crazy on
[26:09] bitcoin Twitter on X or whatever and we
[26:12] keep calling everything a scam once we
[26:14] become orange pilled and we start to
[26:17] question everything
[26:19] it's when you lower your time preference
[26:24] different things have value when I told
[26:27] to an employee right now to a business
[26:30] partner I tell them look I want to work
[26:33] with you I want to keep working with you
[26:35] for the next two to five years I have
[26:37] said this to every single person on my
[26:40] team okay I it's not just uh Fly by
[26:44] Night Thing you you don't do something
[26:47] just for a cash grab you don't do
[26:50] something that will just sell an IPO and
[26:54] I IO uh initial coin offering it's not
[26:57] just to sell a few nfts or do something
[27:00] like that we're creating something that
[27:02] we we want you to be proud to be
[27:05] associated with and that's why
[27:08] bitcoiners work hard um it's night and
[27:12] day with my other businesses we you can
[27:15] just call them Fiat businesses there's
[27:17] toxicity but not the good kind there's a
[27:20] toxic environment it's all about um
[27:23] buying things it's all about Fiat gains
[27:27] it's all about me me me all the time me
[27:31] I want to win this I want to step on
[27:33] other people so that I get there first
[27:36] and things like that and you can
[27:38] contrast that with bitcoiners who are
[27:41] basically happy hippies right now this
[27:44] I've written an article about this this
[27:46] is the new hippie movement it's it's not
[27:49] exactly that but it it's so similar that
[27:53] you can say it like that so that you can
[27:57] uh get it immediately uh when you talk
[27:59] especially the Noster people I don't
[28:01] know if you've been to people to nosta
[28:05] or whatever I've never been there but I
[28:07] talked to someone to a few people like
[28:09] Derek Ross and a few developers who went
[28:11] to nost Rica and basically they are the
[28:14] new hippies the Bitcoin hippies they are
[28:16] wealthy they do things and they're all
[28:20] relaxed and um trying to create like
[28:24] Sovereign things and decentralized and
[28:28] uh digital Nomads and all these things
[28:32] so basically you don't have to go get to
[28:35] that extreme you can still keep your day
[28:37] job and be a bitcoiner you can keep
[28:41] doing what you're doing and be a
[28:43] bitcoiner for example I remember there
[28:45] was a guy on Twitter and he said I'm a
[28:48] lawyer what can I do to help Bitcoin I
[28:51] can't do I have to learn to code and a
[28:54] lot of people in who are in bit bcoin
[28:57] keep saying oh yeah you have to learn to
[28:59] code and you have to learn how to
[29:00] contribute and stuff like that and I
[29:03] immediately I answered to him man you're
[29:06] a lawyer we need lawyers in the Bitcoin
[29:08] space we have a a ton of questions we
[29:12] have a a huge amount of questions
[29:14] wherever wherever in the world you are
[29:16] okay if you're in the US if you're in
[29:18] Europe depending on which country you
[29:20] are there is going to be a ton of um
[29:23] legal stuff to figure out with Bitcoin
[29:27] so we want your expertise on the vent
[29:30] diagram where these two things overlap
[29:33] okay you don't have to learn to code who
[29:35] cares there's a thousand more Bitcoin
[29:37] core developers and lightning developers
[29:40] and all these things we need your
[29:42] expertise on this and that's my general
[29:46] advice to people for example me even
[29:49] though I'm a computer guy can never call
[29:51] myself for the coder I can kit bash some
[29:55] things especially now with chat GPT it's
[29:58] much easier but I would rather do the
[30:01] things that I'm good at which is
[30:03] websites marketing design um leading the
[30:08] way basically uh because I am a little
[30:11] bit of an influencer especially these
[30:13] couple of years into Bitcoin because
[30:15] it's exciting but it's not it's not that
[30:18] I want to show myself it's because I
[30:21] want people to listen to this message I
[30:23] want people in Greece for example to
[30:25] come up to me and tell me okay George
[30:28] how will I do this Hardware wallet thing
[30:30] you keep telling us that we need a
[30:32] hardware wallet how can I do this thing
[30:35] and I can suggest like a hardware wallet
[30:38] which is preferably open source and I
[30:40] can tell them you you you know you have
[30:43] to understand what you're doing keep
[30:45] your your coins on coinbase if you want
[30:47] to use for example the debit card uh
[30:50] sorry the binance for example if you
[30:52] want to use the debit card but
[30:55] understand what you're doing understand
[30:57] that that it's not your coins I want you
[30:59] to understand that and I tell them I
[31:02] tell that to my students I want you to
[31:05] know what you're doing and understand
[31:06] what you're doing so that in two years
[31:09] when you do get rug pulled and you do
[31:11] get scammed you will be like okay now I
[31:15] get it I have the tools I have the
[31:17] knowledge George showed me uh he pointed
[31:20] me to like a few tutorials and books and
[31:22] things like that I know what to do now I
[31:26] will stop doing stupid things with my
[31:29] with my money and with my
[31:32] coins uh so yeah that's my mentality and
[31:35] uh what I want to say to everyone since
[31:37] we started this discussion is what no
[31:39] matter what you do you should get into
[31:41] Bitcoin um declare yourself like uh
[31:46] there I saw a nice tweet how do be how
[31:48] do I become the Bitcoin dentist and uh
[31:52] another podcaster replied to him and he
[31:54] he told him just start calling yourself
[31:57] the Bitcoin dentist whatever that means
[31:59] you will figure it out along the way uh
[32:03] we have so many people who have done the
[32:05] same there's a BTC therapist you know
[32:09] there's whatever just identify with that
[32:12] and you will figure it out along the way
[32:14] and add your own unique spin into this
[32:17] because it's huge it's huge and it's not
[32:20] just about the code it's about the
[32:22] social
[32:23] layer which is what works in tandem with
[32:28] the Bitcoin layer which is basically the
[32:31] software and the hardware okay the
[32:34] hardware itself and the code itself is
[32:37] useless without the people using it like
[32:40] we say what matters are the economic
[32:43] nodes economic is just another way to
[32:46] say active nodes active means the user
[32:50] node
[32:52] pair all the only nodes that matter are
[32:55] the nodes that you actually use if a
[32:58] user uses that node then it's valuable I
[33:01] can spin up a thousand nodes on AWS it
[33:04] doesn't matter there's no
[33:06] decentralization and there's no way to
[33:08] overtake the network but I run a node
[33:11] it's right here uh it's out of frame
[33:13] it's on a Raspberry Pi and it's a
[33:15] lightning node I play around with it I
[33:16] tinker with it um I I have a vote in the
[33:20] system I have I'm informed of the
[33:24] decisions I when the
[33:27] up upgrade for example the soft Fork was
[33:30] decided I decided to upgrade my Bitcoin
[33:34] core to support the to rot upgrade I had
[33:37] a vote in the system when you have the
[33:40] binance or the other exchange uh account
[33:44] they get to decide for you they get to
[33:47] vote for you so that's a specific thing
[33:52] to understand that people who run nodes
[33:55] the node runners do get a vote in this
[33:59] democracy that
[34:01] is uh happening on the Bitcoin uh layer
[34:05] which is global right and there aren't
[34:07] that many of us I think there are what
[34:10] like 70,000 nodes something like that
[34:13] it's a small amount a small amount and
[34:16] we need more people to understand what
[34:18] they're
[34:20] doing um that's that's my advice for all
[34:24] this that's uh amazing uh I mean running
[34:27] note uh as a bitcoiner you should
[34:28] definitely do it even even if you uh
[34:31] don't think it it you should not do it
[34:34] but just because you learn so much from
[34:37] Bitcoin for it like setting it up and
[34:40] learning about what is a note how is it
[34:43] essentialized what what role does a note
[34:45] play what role does a miner play what
[34:47] role does does the the economic like the
[34:51] Bitcoin as itself play what role does
[34:53] all the game theory aspects uh play how
[34:56] can it be attacked how can it not be
[34:58] attacked like there are so many stuffs
[35:00] you have to learn and running in node
[35:03] and setting it up once is so important
[35:05] you should run it all the time you
[35:07] should have participate in the network
[35:09] but even just setting it up once to see
[35:11] how it works it's so important um and
[35:15] back to the topic of Bitcoin um and and
[35:18] you yourself I'm always fascinated how
[35:21] Bitcoin is is opening up topics for
[35:24] people sometimes people I think it's
[35:27] more the SC the the the less cases with
[35:30] people that are already in the Bitcoin
[35:33] mindset that were in The Sound money
[35:35] mindset maybe they were like in Gold
[35:36] before and then all of the sudden they
[35:38] get Bitcoin and did not change a lot in
[35:40] their life they just like oh there's
[35:42] Bitcoin now for most people it's a
[35:45] different case they see Bitcoin and all
[35:47] of the sudden uh the Bitcoin uh changes
[35:51] their lives it's like this popular meme
[35:54] where like you cannot change Bitcoin
[35:56] Bitcoin Chang changes you uh because all
[35:58] of the sudden you are asking yourself oh
[36:00] what what is about it Central Banking
[36:03] what is that what is that and you start
[36:04] to think critical about stuff uh and I'm
[36:07] always curious what uh did Bitcoin
[36:11] change in you or how was how was the CH
[36:14] you being now in Bitcoin uh was there a
[36:17] big difference what did bit Bitcoin
[36:19] teach you well the difference was
[36:21] massive the difference was massive if
[36:23] you want to read about it uh my opinions
[36:26] on that
[36:27] I've written them in a guide basically
[36:30] it's uh we need to talk about Bitcoin
[36:33] it's on Amazon it's just a guide some
[36:35] essays basically bound together on how
[36:39] to orange pill people but in those
[36:42] guides I explain how being orange pilled
[36:46] is a culture shock it's a culture shock
[36:48] that's why people are resistant to it I
[36:51] saw a video from a neuroscientist uh
[36:54] like a couple of days ago that said
[36:56] people are resistant to change
[36:58] especially when you challenge those
[37:01] preconceived notions that they have for
[37:03] how the world
[37:04] Works obviously we none of us we know
[37:08] that okay because we've studied how
[37:09] money Works how Fiat money works and
[37:11] nobody understands it and it's this
[37:13] esoteric thing from the kyian economists
[37:16] keeping it weird so that you don't get
[37:19] it and they are the experts and they
[37:21] tell you what to do I hate
[37:24] experts okay experts just pretend to not
[37:31] being able to explain something if you
[37:33] can't explain it then you don't
[37:35] understand it it's simple as that who
[37:37] you know who is an expert for example
[37:39] Andreas andonopoulos for example he's a
[37:42] one of the best Bitcoin experts that we
[37:44] have call himself an expert he can never
[37:46] become a full expert because he explains
[37:49] things and you understand them that's
[37:52] what genius is and when you have a
[37:55] kenian person an economist telling you
[37:58] oh you know the M1 and the M2 and you
[38:01] don't understand inflation and no
[38:03] deflation doesn't work because this and
[38:07] that and they destroy your economy
[38:09] basically just like they did in Greece
[38:11] like with the Greek debt and the
[38:13] financial crisis when they spread these
[38:16] lies just so they can benefit themselves
[38:19] obviously none of us know how money
[38:22] works and when you become orange pilled
[38:25] during that process you start learning
[38:27] about money and how money works and most
[38:30] people have never even gotten to the
[38:33] saving mindset for example one of the
[38:36] best books for this the mainstream books
[38:38] is Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert
[38:41] kosaki I read that like 20 years ago and
[38:45] it was very helpful for me to get into
[38:48] the investor mindset I didn't manage to
[38:50] become like a huge investor but I always
[38:53] had those basic B basic lessons in the
[38:57] back of my mind most people don't have
[39:00] that but most people get their paycheck
[39:02] they get like
[39:05] 100,000 let's say and they see how to
[39:08] spend it quickly and they get into debt
[39:12] to buy more things and they think that
[39:15] they saved up because they bought on
[39:17] sale during Black Friday during
[39:19] Christmas sales they say oh I bought
[39:21] this couch I bought this TV it was only
[39:24] 500 and they marked it down to 300 and I
[39:28] saved €200 and that's how they think and
[39:33] most people are not ready to study and
[39:36] understand that this is the wrong way to
[39:38] go about it of course you need to buy
[39:40] things of course you need stuff for you
[39:42] yourself your family whatever but it's a
[39:46] different thing when you save with hard
[39:49] money and um that's the main thing that
[39:54] separates bitcoiners the time preference
[39:57] the savings mindset and the the ability
[40:02] basically to distinguish what is
[40:05] important and what's not um the the
[40:08] Italian uh lady um uh Laura uh with from
[40:13] the traveling couple she posted
[40:16] something that Bitcoin has reuired my
[40:19] brain she posted like a tweet a few days
[40:21] ago and she said oh I want to buy those
[40:24] shoes for example when I was PR pre-
[40:27] Bitcoin I would have bought the shoes
[40:29] right now I I say it's not that
[40:31] important and if I spend those SS maybe
[40:34] in 5 years that same amount of SATs
[40:37] might be able to buy me like an entire
[40:40] car and you never know and it is
[40:42] possible so it changes your mind it
[40:45] changes your mind you mentioned
[40:47] something about people being able to to
[40:49] be in that mindset uh those are the gold
[40:52] bugs those are the gold bugs who think
[40:55] on hard money
[40:57] and I just think that most we have
[41:00] nothing to separate with a gold box most
[41:03] of them are halfway there most of them
[41:06] are halfway there and they think the
[41:08] same they except Peter Schiff I don't
[41:11] know what's happening with that guy he's
[41:12] so funny um but all the gold bugs are
[41:16] like halfway there and many of them do
[41:18] have Bitcoin for example like Robert
[41:21] Kaki and these people um they do have
[41:24] Bitcoin they understand the hard money
[41:26] mindset even if they don't understand
[41:28] Bitcoin obviously most of them are a bit
[41:32] older in age but there are some uh
[41:35] younger ones but the important thing for
[41:39] them for us to orange pill them is to
[41:42] explain I think how uh Bitcoin gets its
[41:46] value through proof of work right this
[41:48] thing right here right now this minor is
[41:51] generating proof of work right now and
[41:54] it's mining Bitcoin at this moment how
[41:58] do you explain that and the most
[42:00] important thing that they need to
[42:02] understand is um how do you call
[42:06] it that it has the properties that
[42:08] Bitcoin has the properties of gold but
[42:11] with the added benefit of the digital
[42:14] era which is makes it easy to teleport
[42:16] basically like Michael sailor says to to
[42:19] send it like an email like Adreas adopo
[42:23] says basically that's what they need to
[42:26] understand
[42:26] and another quite important thing is the
[42:29] Bitcoin prehistory there's a very nice
[42:32] Slide by Dan held I show that to every
[42:36] lesson that I start with my students and
[42:40] there's a Bitcoin prehistory and it just
[42:42] shows how the eash and the way die uh
[42:47] cryptography and the hash cash and all
[42:51] the and eash and all these things how
[42:54] they converged over 40 years which is
[42:58] insane it's 40 years they converged into
[43:02] Bitcoin in 200 and N basically that's
[43:07] what people need to understand this is
[43:09] not just a new technology it's been
[43:12] under development for over 50 years it's
[43:16] crazy it's crazy and this is the most
[43:21] Hightech thing that we have created I'm
[43:25] also a Sci-Fi author so I like to think
[43:27] about the Sci-Fi implications of Bitcoin
[43:30] and this is the most advanced thing that
[43:34] we've created uh lately I think it will
[43:37] go in history as the like the transistor
[43:41] the printing press and then it's going
[43:43] to be Bitcoin something like that yeah
[43:45] definitely and and as you said also the
[43:47] you like to think about the Sci-Fi the
[43:50] future implications of that and this is
[43:52] also kind of my my next question for you
[43:55] um because I'm also um always interested
[43:57] like what is the future of of Bitcoin
[44:00] like in the next 10 50 100 years look
[44:03] like what do you think will be the most
[44:05] um exciting topics or areas in Bitcoin
[44:09] and what do you think uh this future of
[44:13] of Bitcoin where because we now really
[44:15] early but in 50 years 100 years a big
[44:19] proportion or maybe even everyone
[44:22] already adopted a Bitcoin standard um
[44:25] how will this world look like and what
[44:28] topics and areas are you really looking
[44:30] forward to see in this this kind of time
[44:32] frame in the
[44:33] future I can talk about this for a whole
[44:36] other episode um okay so I'm going to
[44:38] focus on a couple of things the
[44:42] important thing that I see I'm very
[44:44] excited about lightning uh when I saw it
[44:48] it was amazing just to clarify I tried
[44:52] Bitcoin like8 years ago and I tried to
[44:55] use it I tried to mine a bit with the
[44:57] USB Eruptor the miners it just played
[45:00] around with it I didn't understand it
[45:02] there weren't that many guides there
[45:04] weren't uh stuff to watch on YouTube and
[45:07] it was very technical even though I'm a
[45:09] computer guy it was very technical very
[45:12] hard to understand no way to self
[45:14] custody I never bought any coins I never
[45:17] managed to get any coins but I just
[45:19] played around with the technology and
[45:22] basically what we are right now we are
[45:25] in the dialogue
[45:26] uh phase of of Bitcoin and because the
[45:30] yes curve of adoption is going to become
[45:33] um very fast um like how do we say
[45:37] gradually then suddenly basically what
[45:40] what we say with that Meme gradually
[45:42] then suddenly is the network effect
[45:45] these technologies have and you can just
[45:48] follow the adoption of the internet I
[45:50] believe with the with lightning uh we're
[45:54] going to have the L 402 that's L
[45:58] lightning 402 that's the code on the
[46:02] HTTP site that you have like 404 404
[46:06] side not found L 402 uh the 402 code was
[46:10] embedded into the HTTP system beforehand
[46:13] when it was created like so many years
[46:15] ago over 25 years ago I think uh it was
[46:19] there it was there the the internet was
[46:23] meant to have a eded digital payments
[46:28] obviously we had nothing that would work
[46:30] up until now and right now the
[46:34] l402 uh open- Source Community basically
[46:37] is trying to get uh lightning to work
[46:41] natively inside every single browser so
[46:44] what do I see happening in the future
[46:46] it's quite simple everybody will use
[46:48] Bitcoin everybody will will use
[46:50] lightning they won't even know about it
[46:52] they will have no idea that they're
[46:55] using bit coin they will use their
[46:57] Facebook app their Tik Tok and they will
[46:59] earn
[47:01] points and then they can they will be
[47:03] able to use those points to get
[47:05] something like boost a post or buy
[47:08] something digital or some asset some top
[47:12] rot assets some nft something like that
[47:14] they will have no idea the end user will
[47:17] be using Bitcoin all day long for like
[47:21] 10 hours per day and they will have no
[47:24] clue that they're using Bitcoin because
[47:26] we're talking about streaming money if
[47:28] you follow it's very simple it's very
[47:30] simple streaming money streaming SATs is
[47:33] basically pay as you go for everything
[47:35] right now um if you want PayPal if you
[47:39] if you want to sell something for 90
[47:41] cents on PayPal you can't but you can
[47:44] sell stuff on Lightning for two sets you
[47:48] can sell stuff for 30 SATs for 21 SATs
[47:51] it's crazy micro payments can happen uh
[47:54] all the time on Noster we're start we've
[47:56] started using it so streaming money is
[47:59] basically pay as you go for example
[48:01] let's say that this was a video call and
[48:05] you were one of my clients and I was
[48:08] Consulting I could basically turn it on
[48:11] you could plug in and
[48:13] sign and sign with your uh lightning
[48:17] wallet for the transaction and every
[48:21] second that we were connected and I was
[48:24] giving you my consult
[48:26] I could charge you for like 30 SS now we
[48:30] are coming to the end routine of the
[48:31] podcast where the the previous guest
[48:33] actually asks a question for the the
[48:36] next guest without knowing who is the
[48:38] next guest and uh the question is an
[48:41] interesting one because it also touches
[48:43] a little bit on uh the question uh
[48:46] before I what I asked you and it's what
[48:48] is the most bullish outcome uh you can
[48:51] imagine for Bitcoin in this next cycle
[48:53] like we now in this bull cycle what do
[48:56] you think is the most bullish outcome in
[48:58] this next cycle and uh there is no the
[49:02] think the previous guest specifically
[49:04] did not ask for like a price prediction
[49:07] but he's like what what do you think
[49:09] will be the most bullish thing that can
[49:12] happen in the next uh cycle the most
[49:15] bullish thing that can happen in the
[49:17] next cycle let's think well I think it
[49:22] has to do with geopolitics basically um
[49:26] I think the most bullish outcome would
[49:29] be that Banks start adopting Bitcoin
[49:34] because they realize that they can't
[49:36] fight it um some things like the Iranian
[49:41] bank for example which is under
[49:44] sanctions using and accepting Bitcoin
[49:47] that would be something huge with
[49:51] massive geopolitical
[49:53] ramifications uh basically something big
[49:57] like Nigeria for example who have not
[50:00] that problem exactly but they have the
[50:03] enira the digital the the cbdc basically
[50:08] and people are rejecting it and people
[50:11] want to use Bitcoin a huge chunk of the
[50:14] traffic is being used by them basically
[50:17] a mainstream application that proves
[50:20] that this works and that will be the
[50:23] most bullish outcome we're start we
[50:25] started seeing this with the ETFs um
[50:28] promoting and running ads and uh trying
[50:31] to get people to use uh
[50:34] Bitcoin and um that would be the most
[50:38] bullish outcome and to get basically
[50:42] lightning
[50:43] users uh to to start using it daily and
[50:47] so they can use it and save even in a
[50:50] custodial way in the beginning even
[50:52] though they don't understand what
[50:53] they're doing just so that they get
[50:55] exposure to that and start uh and start
[50:58] learning it I know it's not a very a
[51:00] very exciting answer but uh imagine the
[51:04] implications in people's lives because
[51:08] many people still believe the mainstream
[51:10] media and when there's an article with
[51:13] fud uh oh Bitcoin is bad for the
[51:16] environment they believe it they believe
[51:18] it and uh basically that that flip side
[51:22] that we've started seeing with the ETF
[51:26] where you start seeing articles being
[51:28] for Bitcoin rather than against
[51:31] Bitcoin uh yeah that's that's the most
[51:34] bullish outcome even though it's not
[51:36] that exciting yeah that slowly slowly
[51:38] everyone uh is coming into Bitcoin and
[51:40] also the mainstream media and all this
[51:42] narrative will slowly slowly I think uh
[51:45] shift and this will be a extremely
[51:47] bullish thing I think most bitcoiners
[51:50] don't watch too much of the mainstream
[51:52] media so we don't hear about it too much
[51:54] but if you go out outside of your uh
[51:57] Bitcoin bubble you all of the sudden
[51:58] hear all this fut coming from the
[52:00] mainstream media where we like oh how
[52:02] can someone believe it oh actually there
[52:03] are people that believe in this so I I
[52:06] really enjoyed uh our conversation and
[52:08] our podcast together uh and I liked your
[52:11] insights in the love is Bitcoin in what
