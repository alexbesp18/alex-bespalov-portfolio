[00:00] can print Bitcoin it's very low
[00:01] maintenance compared to real estate
[00:03] we'll dump an s19 into imersion tank
[00:06] build a heat exchanger and and basically
[00:08] heat the water that's going in there so
[00:10] it's very invention time you know R
[00:12] rudimentary systems you know people are
[00:14] using wood and it's not like fancy
[00:17] manufacturing it's just like rough MVP
[00:19] systems you know that people are
[00:20] building to to do proof of Concepts how
[00:23] did this all start I don't like talking
[00:25] about this
[00:26] story you posted something yesterday and
[00:29] I liked it uh the breakdown between
[00:33] Bitcoin mining investment and the real
[00:35] estate investing and why Bitcoin mining
[00:38] investing is is is like an Superior to
[00:41] real estate investing like the first
[00:43] question I always have like for most
[00:45] people it's probably better to just
[00:47] directly invest in Bitcoin or where are
[00:50] the use cases for someone to invest in a
[00:55] Bitcoin mining facility instead of
[00:58] Bitcoin and why why is it such a great
[01:01] investment against like maybe real
[01:03] estate and maybe even like against
[01:05] Bitcoin
[01:06] itself yeah for sure you know uh yeah I
[01:10] I I don't know here in Canada we have a
[01:12] real estate bubble it is insane it costs
[01:15] you know if you go to the big markets
[01:17] like Vancouver or Toronto you know
[01:19] housing costs you know 10 12 times the
[01:22] average person's income right so like
[01:25] million dooll homes when you know the
[01:28] the average salary is under six figures
[01:30] right and so we got a crazy property bub
[01:33] Bubble for years you know real estate
[01:35] was a good investment you know when
[01:36] interest rates were super low and the
[01:38] Central Bank you know was in emergency
[01:40] interest rates after 2008 you know
[01:43] everybody invested in real estate
[01:45] because it was always going up because
[01:46] of course cheap money right it wasn't
[01:48] going up because it was increasing in
[01:51] value it was going up because the the
[01:53] cost to borrow was going down and you
[01:56] know everybody could borrow a million
[01:58] dollars for you know a few thousand
[01:59] dollar a month so everybody did that you
[02:02] know and now we're in a place you know
[02:05] what 10 years later or or even longer
[02:07] now where we've had these emergency
[02:08] interest rates where you know they
[02:10] printed even more for covid like Canada
[02:12] printed more money during covid than it
[02:14] did in the last 100 years so you know we
[02:18] we were flush with cash in our system
[02:20] and you know that basically caused
[02:22] inflation you know our everything went
[02:24] up in value here our our like rental
[02:27] places for people you know went up over
[02:30] two years you know like which was once
[02:32] like a you know $1,800 a month to rent a
[02:35] house you know is now $4,000 to rent a
[02:38] house you know it it just it went insane
[02:41] right and then that that's the housing
[02:43] part you know obviously mortgages went
[02:44] up crazy as well and so you know the
[02:48] cost to carry a home you know quickly is
[02:51] just out of range and so when you think
[02:53] of you know being a landlord for example
[02:56] like in places again like Vancouver and
[02:58] Toronto you know the markets where
[03:00] there's tons of people you know lots of
[03:02] people want to live there they want to
[03:03] go there you know you can't buy a cash
[03:07] flow property if you want to get into
[03:08] real estate you can't buy a house you
[03:11] know for a million dollars and then you
[03:13] know rent it out for $6,000 a month
[03:15] because that's what the mortgage costs
[03:16] right now you know unless you're you're
[03:18] putting a half a million dollars down on
[03:20] a house you know you're you're not going
[03:22] to really you're not going to cash flow
[03:24] positive you're basically so many people
[03:26] over the last 10 years in those markets
[03:28] just crossed their fingers for Equity
[03:30] gains right because they're just waiting
[03:32] to to dump the house on somebody else
[03:34] that's going to go get even more debt
[03:36] you know because interest rates are so
[03:38] low and then that's the pay payout so
[03:41] that whole Speculator Market lasted for
[03:43] a very long time until they started
[03:45] raising interest rates and now that's
[03:47] evaporated like you know and prices are
[03:50] starting to come down but again it's
[03:52] it's a huge speculative gamble to to
[03:55] basically you know buy unless you've got
[03:58] tons of cash and you want to you you're
[04:00] okay with putting that you know cash
[04:02] into a property and then mortgaging
[04:04] what's left you know there's there's
[04:06] just not enough cash flow to go to to
[04:08] actually cover the expenses of holding a
[04:11] rental property uh a residential rental
[04:14] property and actually cash flow positive
[04:16] like you're going to be putting money
[04:17] into it month over month on the mortgage
[04:19] let alone like if you need a new roof or
[04:21] you need a new dishwasher or you know
[04:23] what other expenses so so so that's kind
[04:27] of the the argument I guess against kind
[04:29] of real estate especially in Canada I
[04:31] think you know in the U us it's getting
[04:33] that like that as well but you know
[04:35] their property bubble burst in 2008 and
[04:38] prices came down much lower to to where
[04:40] Canada is so you know going back to the
[04:45] Bitcoin piece here and I don't think
[04:46] Bitcoin mining is for everybody you know
[04:49] I I think a lot of people can get into
[04:50] it but you know it takes an investment
[04:52] in time you know you got to understand
[04:53] Bitcoin you got to believe in the whole
[04:55] Bitcoin thesis before you start mining
[04:58] because it's not
[05:00] you know it's it's complex in a lot of
[05:02] ways right it's not easy to just you
[05:04] know plug something in and just start
[05:06] mining Tomorrow there's a lot of things
[05:07] to think about and when I talk about you
[05:11] know investing I I think there's room
[05:12] for the you know the solo Miner the pleb
[05:15] you know like the person that wants to
[05:16] mine in their garage uh you know there's
[05:19] a lot of people like that that I've
[05:20] already helped you know like one one or
[05:22] two miners you know they just want to
[05:24] run something uh they want to be part of
[05:26] it you know and you know maybe they have
[05:28] a garage and a shop or a basement that's
[05:30] got you know room on their electrical
[05:32] panel and they can you know they can run
[05:34] one minor or two minor so I think
[05:36] there's those people out there that
[05:37] that's obviously to me I think it's a
[05:39] good investment you know with the you
[05:42] know the price where bitcoin's going to
[05:43] go you know in the long term I I I look
[05:47] at it as a retirement kind of Fund in in
[05:50] a sense you know for people that
[05:51] actually can do that you know that can
[05:53] actually set up a minor you know manage
[05:56] it you know and and understand how
[05:58] wallets work and pools work and stuff
[06:00] like that so I I think there's for those
[06:02] that can do a lot of the work themselves
[06:04] it's a good long-term investment you
[06:06] know I think you're going to be
[06:07] producing you you can print Bitcoin you
[06:10] know you can basically mine enough and
[06:12] as the price goes up you know it's a
[06:15] Bitcoin is a savings vehicle so to me
[06:17] you know you're just putting money into
[06:18] your savings You're Building equity and
[06:21] again compared to housing that's it
[06:23] you're done you know you have a minor
[06:24] you got to pay your electric electrical
[06:26] bill same thing in renting properties
[06:28] right you got to pay your electrical
[06:29] bills but like you have an electrical
[06:31] bill and then you know minor maintenance
[06:34] cleaning up like those kinds of things
[06:35] it's very low maintenance compared to
[06:38] real estate you know so that that's one
[06:40] aspect I think is you know those you
[06:42] know small miners I'm working with
[06:44] others right now where people are
[06:46] starting to use it for heat right so
[06:47] there's that other aspects I just sold
[06:49] an S9 minor to a a guy out here that
[06:52] puts it in his crawl space and he blows
[06:54] the air up into his you know into his
[06:56] house you know and he Heats his house
[06:59] right so he's invested in Bitcoin but
[07:01] you know more of like tinkering right so
[07:05] the next uh you know group of customers
[07:07] that we tend to work with sometimes are
[07:09] people that want to use the heat so they
[07:11] may buy um like we've got one guy again
[07:14] it's cold out here in Manitoba in the
[07:16] winter it's minus 20 right now so you
[07:18] know you run a an s19 in a shop all
[07:22] night that shop stays warm right if it's
[07:25] running and you got it in a good sound
[07:27] enclosure you know they're already
[07:29] already spending natural gas or
[07:31] electricity just going into a heater to
[07:33] heat these spaces so you can retrofit in
[07:36] a a miner as long as you can get the
[07:38] sound down you put it in a closure in
[07:40] the corner this thing will pump out heat
[07:43] and you know in the minus t it it
[07:46] literally can keep a little thousand
[07:48] square foot shop warm no problem and you
[07:51] know it pays for itself it actually you
[07:52] know creates money they save money not
[07:55] having to run just an electric heater
[07:58] you know a big huge industri electric
[07:59] heater that also takes 220 volt you know
[08:03] also takes you know the same amount of
[08:05] power but instead you're using that
[08:07] power to to to generate Bitcoin and so
[08:11] we're starting to see more of that that
[08:12] use case where it's you know you're
[08:14] supplementing you're Heating and then
[08:16] those same kind of guys we're we're
[08:18] starting to pitch more of like smaller
[08:21] uh mining operations for those types of
[08:23] people that have these shops you know
[08:24] they have maybe a
[08:27] spare you know 100 or 200 square feet
[08:30] and you know the plan would be to put
[08:32] like immersion miners you can run up to
[08:34] like you know six immersion miners in
[08:36] one of these facilities again use the
[08:38] heat but again a lot of these commercial
[08:40] properties have you know a reasonable
[08:43] amount of power to run smaller kind of
[08:45] uh mines right smaller amount of uh Asic
[08:49] mines you know just again supplementing
[08:51] income um possibly using the Heat and
[08:54] things like that so there's that um in
[08:57] terms of you know there's so many
[08:59] options right so again not everybody can
[09:01] can mine not everybody has low energy
[09:04] rates we have great energy rates here we
[09:06] have over 15 hydroelectric dams in
[09:09] Manitoba so it's all Hydro you know and
[09:12] the retail rate in homes is like under
[09:15] nine cents right so so the average
[09:18] person you know me and and you know my
[09:20] neighbors who just have electricity
[09:21] coming into the house like it's only
[09:23] it's about seven cents us you know and
[09:26] that's not even a commercial price which
[09:28] you can get you know the more you
[09:29] consume you can negotiate better prices
[09:31] and so so for us that makes it
[09:34] attractive for even you know small
[09:36] businesses people that have shops
[09:37] commercial properties you know
[09:39] industrial properties you know they have
[09:42] good power contracts because they're
[09:43] using it already they have power
[09:45] infrastructure on their properties not
[09:47] for Mega mines we're not talking about
[09:49] you know one megawatt mines but like the
[09:52] ones that don't require
[09:54] $100,000 uh studies in order to plug in
[09:57] mines so we're going after after a you
[10:00] know the smaller Market where people can
[10:02] then supplement and you know run these
[10:04] smaller
[10:05] mines um the other opportunity again is
[10:08] cloud mining we don't do that but that's
[10:10] another option like in terms of
[10:12] investing in this you know if you don't
[10:13] live in a jurisdiction where you know
[10:15] maybe you're paying 34 cents a kilowatt
[10:18] hour and it just you know it's going to
[10:19] take a you know $500,000 Bitcoin you
[10:22] know for it to make it worthwhile for
[10:24] you to to run your miners so um so a lot
[10:27] I think that would make for a lot of
[10:29] people again you can get seven cents
[10:32] Allin hosting with almost anybody you
[10:34] know around the world in these kind of
[10:36] lower you know cost environments and I
[10:38] think that's a definite benefit again
[10:40] even same compared to real estate like
[10:43] this thing cash flows positive with very
[10:46] little uh maintenance right you send you
[10:49] know your Cloud company it's you're all
[10:51] online you don't have to go nowhere like
[10:52] that to me compared to real estate is
[10:55] way easier and and you can just
[10:57] incrementally add like that's to me the
[10:58] easiest way to invest in mining
[11:02] um but you know again it's you know it
[11:05] takes some effort right it's still not
[11:07] rocket science so um so I think that's
[11:10] it you know we we we're still a new
[11:12] company we're exploring other options
[11:14] you know we've got lots of wind farms
[11:16] out here and we're we're gonna we're
[11:18] going to look at some projects and try
[11:19] to go after some of those companies for
[11:21] you know load balancing you know Bal
[11:23] grid balancing and stuff like that um
[11:26] but yeah know I think it's not for
[11:28] everybody you know in terms of real
[11:30] estate versus Bitcoin mining but but I
[11:32] definitely think you know if you
[11:34] understand it then most people are Allin
[11:36] when they get it right they're already
[11:38] in on bitcoin and to me they're they're
[11:40] they're just interested in being part of
[11:42] it and you know making the money and
[11:44] being able to actually cash flow positiv
[11:46] the investment you know is obviously
[11:48] important but uh you know a lot of
[11:50] people are still experimenting you know
[11:52] and still kind of just want to be a part
[11:53] of this and they just want to mine
[11:55] Bitcoin because it's you know it's
[11:57] something they want to do and they just
[11:59] do it yeah also think about the utility
[12:02] of it as you said because like where I'm
[12:05] living in Austria there a lot of small U
[12:09] like Circles of like a lot of houses
[12:12] like there are 10 houses then there's a
[12:14] lot nothing that next 10 houses and you
[12:18] see also like they sometimes have like
[12:20] problems with the crit and the
[12:23] electricity and they have like maybe
[12:25] like big places where they can put solar
[12:28] roofs and this starting to put more
[12:29] solar stuff on there they put more local
[12:33] uh batteries also there so they can
[12:35] capture the energy and it would be
[12:37] amazing like if they have like a pool uh
[12:40] then they can warm the pool with the
[12:42] Bitcoin mining they can mine maybe they
[12:44] have a basement because it's like
[12:45] usually bigger houses uh and they can
[12:48] stabilize the git they like so many
[12:51] possibilities Beyond Bitcoin mining to
[12:53] use the Bitcoin miners like cool the
[12:56] Bitcoin miners with water and warm the
[12:59] water at the same time like I it's it's
[13:02] an an amazing field to to be in like I
[13:04] really like it and the future
[13:06] possibilities also the utility of it um
[13:09] do you see like a future where Bitcoin
[13:11] mining is so integrated in in household
[13:15] gadgets where like a heater and and a
[13:19] pool warmer it's like there are
[13:21] commercial things where you can just
[13:23] plug it in and it mines and you get like
[13:25] an an share of it like is that a kind of
[13:27] future or will it be more like only
[13:29] people that are really interested in it
[13:31] and working with companies and building
[13:33] it out that's a yeah I think it's going
[13:35] to be a slow move because I think we're
[13:37] in the tinkering mode I don't know
[13:38] you're on Twitter you you see a lot of
[13:40] these you know really uh you know
[13:43] Innovative projects like the the what is
[13:45] it the hash tub that just went down to
[13:47] Nashville I think where these guys are
[13:48] you know they're hashing and and
[13:50] throwing the water you know just
[13:52] translating that heat into a hot tub
[13:54] like I think it's a great use case and I
[13:56] do think like I've seen some companies
[13:58] that are building like hot water tanks
[13:59] that have you know Asic chips in the
[14:01] middle right and so they're integrating
[14:03] the the mining is going on inside like a
[14:05] total enclosed like hot water tank right
[14:08] so instead of those you know electric
[14:10] rods that are heating your water it it's
[14:12] as6 so I think people are going to
[14:14] invent these things I think we're going
[14:16] to see more of it um yeah it's really
[14:19] interesting but but I I I do think we'll
[14:21] see more it's going to be a very Niche
[14:23] thing um but I I do think we're going to
[14:26] see more integration with it I think
[14:28] there's a lot of people out there in the
[14:30] open source Community working on those
[14:32] types of projects that are really
[14:33] interested you see a lot of Bitcoin
[14:35] heaters from you know the simple S9 in a
[14:38] you know a a laser printed uh you know
[14:42] enclosure you know to make it look fancy
[14:44] and they're building the the software to
[14:46] underclock and you know all these things
[14:48] and ways to convert from 120 you know or
[14:50] 220 to to 120 volts and stuff so we're
[14:54] seeing a lot of that tinkering going on
[14:55] and I think we're going to see more you
[14:57] know like I'm I'm helping a buddy here
[14:59] uh you know he's got um radiant floor
[15:02] heating in his basement so you know like
[15:04] they run the plastic tubes through the
[15:06] floor so you could heat with water and
[15:08] he wants to basically try he's like
[15:10] let's try and do this let's try and you
[15:12] know we'll we'll dump an s19 into ersion
[15:15] tank build a heat exchanger and and
[15:17] basically heat the water that's going in
[15:19] there so you know I I think there's
[15:22] definitely use cases and I think right
[15:23] now it's very you know like it's very
[15:27] invention time you know rud M systems
[15:30] you know people are using wood and it's
[15:31] not like fancy manufacturing it's just
[15:34] like rough MVP systems you know that
[15:37] people are building to to do proof of
[15:38] concept so I think that's only going to
[15:41] involve evolve because all these kind of
[15:43] Tinkers building this stuff like they've
[15:46] got vision and they're just pushing
[15:47] forward on these things so you know I I
[15:49] do see what will it will get more
[15:51] integrated I think and I think we need
[15:53] it to be honest you know our we've got
[15:55] so many mega mines right now you know
[15:57] and and uh
[15:59] the mega mines you know are all on the
[16:02] radar of you know the the grid folks
[16:05] right like here in Manitoba we you know
[16:08] we've got several big mines uh all over
[16:10] the province because of we got so much
[16:12] power but the interest exploded in the
[16:15] last bare market right when we were you
[16:17] know when uh an s19 was 12,000 us and
[16:21] you know hash price was you know almost
[16:23] 20 cents I think per terahash like they
[16:27] just got inundated and our local
[16:28] government has now U put a moratorium on
[16:31] new mines right and so you know anybody
[16:34] that wants to get a megawatt or more has
[16:37] to go you know has to go through the
[16:38] utility right and through the grid and
[16:41] so uh to me that poses some risks and
[16:44] challenges you know and it's a choke
[16:46] point you're now at the the mercy of
[16:48] this you know Crown Corporation this
[16:51] government-owned utility so in that
[16:54] regard I think the the it's a bit harder
[16:56] for the the mega mines and and you know
[16:59] part of our business that we want to go
[17:01] after is more the micro mines and
[17:02] decentralizing the network more right so
[17:05] I think these components these people
[17:06] that are building heaters in it you know
[17:09] it provides more of that
[17:11] decentralization you know less choke
[17:13] points not these Mega mines going oh we
[17:15] run 10,000 machines that's great what
[17:18] happens when the National Guard walks in
[17:20] and takes over your mind right like
[17:21] those are all possibilities right where
[17:24] they're not going to walk into every
[17:25] plebs house you know scattered across
[17:28] you know and you know shut off people's
[17:31] minds and stuff so I think you know I I
[17:34] do think I think these smaller use cases
[17:35] will grow and people will you know
[17:39] they'll find a way they'll just want to
[17:41] they'll want to mine a little bit and
[17:43] and we'll just make it easy right hey
[17:44] buy a a heater that you know just plug
[17:46] it in and it Heats and enter your
[17:48] address and here's a nice user interface
[17:51] you know on the device and it's preset
[17:52] up and it's TurnKey like that's what
[17:55] consumers want nowadays right and so
[17:57] we're not there there yet where it's you
[17:59] know plug it in and go but I think
[18:02] there's people working on that you know
[18:03] there's a lot of desktop miners coming
[18:05] out too you know where people are you
[18:07] know it's a 10 Tera has minor right it's
[18:10] it's not going to find a block but you
[18:12] know they're we're getting to those
[18:14] things right which I don't know I think
[18:15] it just increases knowledge about it
[18:18] gets more people in the space and it's
[18:21] just evolving you know so I think it's
[18:23] all good I I definitely think we'll see
[18:25] that yeah I also think so that it will
[18:27] be a of of everyday life the the Bitcoin
[18:31] mining more and more with the gadget
[18:33] coming out um how did you get started
[18:35] with Bitcoin mining or how like let's
[18:37] get a step back like how did you
[18:40] discover Bitcoin uh was it through
[18:42] mining was it Bitcoin first and then
[18:44] mining how did this all all started uh I
[18:48] don't like talking about this story but
[18:49] I do you know um so I I've been a tinker
[18:53] I've been in technology since like the
[18:55] late 90s like you know before Google you
[18:58] know I was on computers I was in BBS
[19:00] rooms
[19:01] and what's a tinker tinker uh play
[19:05] around uh an inventor someone who just
[19:07] likes to play with technology and learn
[19:09] right like I uh I really like to just
[19:11] kind of dissect technology and I I've
[19:14] been in that space like I said since the
[19:16] early
[19:17] 90s uh you know I I was playing with
[19:20] technology so I was always innately
[19:22] curious you know and I watched the
[19:24] internet evolve you know like I was
[19:26] building you know Networks
[19:28] and you know playing with technology
[19:30] learning Linux learning Windows NT all
[19:32] these Technologies in the 90s and and
[19:34] learning about internet uh applications
[19:37] you know there was no SAS applications
[19:39] back then you know none of this
[19:40] web-based stuff existed right and so
[19:43] that's kind of where I started and you
[19:46] know from there I ended up going to
[19:48] college um out west here and I took
[19:51] electronic engineering and computer
[19:53] science and so I was you know going into
[19:56] that field just because I loved
[19:57] computers and so I'm like okay I'm going
[19:59] to go into that and so I went into that
[20:02] and I jumped into Consulting right when
[20:04] I was in there because you know we were
[20:05] at the beginning of the internet you
[20:07] know the dot bubble was just kind of
[20:09] starting to to grow um you know there
[20:11] was just so much money going into
[20:13] technology um and and I was helping
[20:16] companies set up technology I was
[20:17] building you know CRM systems setting up
[20:20] email servers you know all this Tech you
[20:22] know setting up networks for companies I
[20:25] did that for years and years digital
[20:27] transformation basically you know uh I
[20:30] owned I owned an advertising agency that
[20:32] was at the the beginnings of um you know
[20:35] digital marketing you know people were
[20:37] still advertising on TV and print and
[20:39] radio direct mail and all that and and
[20:41] we came in and we're like you know let
[20:43] let us help you kind of capture data and
[20:45] use email and build a website and build
[20:49] sales funnels like we were selling that
[20:50] you know in the early 2000s you know to
[20:53] try to get you know people online very
[20:55] lucrative and you know it it was a a
[20:58] great time it was amazing time to just
[21:00] watch the internet grow and companies
[21:02] just you know adopt technology on mass
[21:05] like just crazy fast and so uh I
[21:09] eventually sold my agency and then I
[21:11] went into just kind of
[21:12] Consulting and I worked for many many
[21:14] different companies and it was right
[21:16] around um 2012 I think is when I
[21:20] actually came across Bitcoin and and
[21:22] again I I came across it from a
[21:24] technology I was like what is this thing
[21:26] you know somebody invented and and
[21:28] wasn't again it was it was new nobody
[21:30] knew anything about it I was just
[21:32] reading about it I read the white paper
[21:33] I'm like this is cool and and you know I
[21:36] was uh you know I was more curious about
[21:39] just the tech and it's like oh NE you
[21:41] can do this but like I didn't invest the
[21:43] time you know I didn't I was just like
[21:46] he this is another Cool Tech right you
[21:48] know just some other cool technology
[21:49] we'll see where it goes you know and
[21:51] didn't didn't buy any you know I wish I
[21:54] did because it was 2012 it was pennies
[21:57] you know it wasn't n very expensive for
[21:59] Bitcoin but uh so I was I was also
[22:03] having kids at that time so that took a
[22:05] lot of like you know energy out of it
[22:07] and I focused on working and I ended up
[22:09] working at um a Central Bank in in
[22:13] Vancouver and so I was brought in and I
[22:15] was working on all kinds of projects
[22:17] there so like I worked with the treasury
[22:18] Department you know they were managing
[22:20] 15 billion doll and it it was a smaller
[22:23] Central Bank that was responsible for
[22:25] the credit unions in Canada which are
[22:27] like kind of regional Banks um but they
[22:30] were the liquidity provider they
[22:32] provided all the technology like all
[22:34] online banking software um you know
[22:37] payments software access to the wire
[22:39] system like all this technology the
[22:41] Central Bank built it and then would you
[22:44] know the the regional Banks would all
[22:46] use this technology and so I worked
[22:49] there for years kind of you know
[22:51] implementing new trading systems in the
[22:53] in the treasury implementing online
[22:55] banking applications and like uh you
[22:58] know web app and mobile app like again
[23:00] this was all in the beginnings of this
[23:01] when we didn't have apps right and so we
[23:03] were you know Leading Edge in a lot of
[23:05] ways and and trying to keep up with the
[23:06] bigger Banks launching all kinds of you
[23:09] know fintech technology to these Credit
[23:11] Unions um I was there for a while I did
[23:14] a variety of projects and one of the
[23:18] projects I was working on was actually
[23:19] to replace the central banking system so
[23:22] this the it was basically the the
[23:24] accounts that all the the regional Banks
[23:26] would have so all these Regional Banks
[23:28] would have bank accounts with the
[23:29] central bank and you know just it was
[23:32] like a business banking system right it
[23:33] were just these were Regional Banks they
[23:35] just had banking specific needs and use
[23:37] cases and so we were building this
[23:40] system and that's when I really started
[23:42] to kind of start to pay attention more
[23:44] to uh to blockchain and and I say
[23:47] blockchain because I came at this from
[23:49] the tech I was like oh what does Bitcoin
[23:52] run on it runs on a blockchain and so in
[23:54] my early years I focused that way you
[23:57] know I was focused on the blockchain and
[24:00] and the use cases for that technology
[24:02] like I looked at it as any as
[24:05] unfortunately I looked at it more like
[24:06] oh it's this is a an a different type of
[24:09] you know Oracle database right it's
[24:11] different it's like a SQL database and
[24:13] that's kind of where my mindset I wasn't
[24:15] thinking about the money I wasn't
[24:17] thinking about investing in this I was
[24:18] more like this is interesting Tech it's
[24:21] very different from you know the
[24:23] relational database we're using in this
[24:24] banking system that we're building right
[24:27] and and honestly it was like two
[24:29] different worlds you know decentralized
[24:31] versus centralized you know and so um
[24:36] because I was in the blockchain you know
[24:38] I was I was starting to play around with
[24:40] all the other tokens as well I started
[24:42] to look at ethereum and and I was around
[24:44] when ethereum first launched they
[24:46] actually called it ethereum project.org
[24:48] I signed up for that website and then
[24:51] they changed that website they closed
[24:53] that down and then they got ethereum do
[24:55] whatever it is right and so again just
[24:57] kind of like like what is this you know
[24:59] I would sign up to every application
[25:01] back in those days you know just on a
[25:03] learning basis you know what is the
[25:04] ethereum I don't even know sign up let's
[25:06] check it out and so uh I played around
[25:09] with ethereum a little bit I actually
[25:11] minted um two tokens uh when I was
[25:14] working at the credit the central bank
[25:15] I'm like oh this would be a good use
[25:17] case for central bank again way before
[25:20] cbdcs you know Central Bank digital
[25:22] coins and and I was really just like hey
[25:24] I'm going to Mint these things just to
[25:26] see if I can do it right it wasn't there
[25:27] wasn't no Grand planned of you know an
[25:30] Ico or anything like that it was just
[25:32] kind of like how does the tech work and
[25:34] so I built two coins you know they're
[25:37] out there never been funded but but
[25:38] again they're just you know just to kind
[25:40] of see how easy it is um from there I I
[25:44] was learning a bit about lightning
[25:45] lightning had just launched around that
[25:47] time as well I think this is about two
[25:49] 2015 my dates are probably wrong but
[25:51] some whenever lightning launched I
[25:53] started looking at that and I was like
[25:54] oh this is really interesting too you
[25:56] know and and and again purely from a
[25:58] tech perspective I wasn't like oh I got
[26:00] to invest and dump my net worth into
[26:02] Bitcoin or whatever and so then you know
[26:04] following that I then I started to pay
[26:06] more attention right and then more as
[26:08] ethereum was growing tokens were
[26:10] launching right and and in the beginning
[26:12] it was kind of it it kind of made sense
[26:14] in the beginning you know it was kind of
[26:15] like oh this token utility for that this
[26:18] token for utility for that but then over
[26:20] the course of like a year and a half it
[26:22] went to like you know a handful of
[26:25] tokens you know plus Bitcoin to like
[26:27] 10,000 then 20,000 it's like everybody's
[26:31] just minting garbage here right and you
[26:33] know I had put I I at that point I had
[26:36] started putting money into things and I
[26:38] was you know I was in Bitcoin I had
[26:40] bought some Bitcoin again on exchanges
[26:42] right I was using coinbase and you know
[26:45] uh we had some exchanges here in Canada
[26:47] that you could ET transfer money into so
[26:49] it's like using those mechanisms uh and
[26:52] then I again I I took that technology
[26:54] route I was looking at all the different
[26:56] Tech metamask and binance and playing
[26:58] with all these you know these
[27:00] technologies that people made for this
[27:03] ecosystem um invested a bunch of stuff
[27:06] and then you know obviously a bare
[27:08] Market came and kicked me in the gut you
[27:10] know I lost a ton of money on on
[27:13] shitcoins um and you know a lot that I
[27:16] was actually planning to bring into
[27:18] Bitcoin I was more I was starting to get
[27:19] interested into mining um bare Market
[27:22] hit lost a ton of money and then you
[27:24] know I basically you know it was that
[27:26] kind of moment where you got to be like
[27:28] what's going on here you know and there
[27:30] was by that time you know there was
[27:32] definitely polarizing voices you know by
[27:35] that time the Bitcoin Maxis were
[27:36] starting to you know be out there and
[27:39] you know I think I remember when I was
[27:41] more of a a techn a bit when I was a
[27:43] block chainer I should say you know I
[27:45] was getting into you know um you know
[27:48] Twitter arguments with you know Maxis
[27:50] you know I was on the other side of the
[27:52] of the fence and all this signal versus
[27:54] noise right bitcoin's the signal and
[27:56] crypt all these tokens are the noise and
[27:58] I was like come on there's so many great
[28:00] use cases and I was like that guy right
[28:03] and and then eventually you know I start
[28:05] to pay attention to you know the the
[28:08] money right starting to look about
[28:10] removing the state from the money and
[28:13] that's when it really kind of clicked
[28:14] for me when I really started to read
[28:15] more of the philosophical reasons for
[28:18] Bitcoin and not the tech you know more
[28:20] about why were me to fix the money God
[28:24] you know I learned a lot but I also
[28:26] dealt with central banks and I learned
[28:29] the thinking I learned you know the the
[28:31] people at the top that were making
[28:33] decisions and how decisions were made
[28:35] like it's an elite club you know and
[28:38] it's not for the people you know a lot
[28:40] of this stuff is is just crazy
[28:42] manipulation and so I was actually like
[28:45] reading this stuff in like safe's book
[28:47] like Bitcoin standard you know I'm
[28:48] reading those kind of that kind of
[28:50] material and then I'm looking I'm
[28:51] working in a central bank and I'm like
[28:53] yeah this is exactly what it's like you
[28:55] know and and it was just like big
[28:57] eyeopener and then I just full pivoted
[28:59] back into Bitcoin and you know there was
[29:03] so much to learn about and then once you
[29:05] you know in all these shitcoins once I
[29:06] removed the shitcoins I was like there's
[29:08] 10 times more to learn about in Bitcoin
[29:10] like there's so many Avenues and so much
[29:12] cool things going on and like layer twos
[29:15] and and so I just shifted my focus and I
[29:18] I sold everything that I had left over
[29:21] and moved everything into Bitcoin and
[29:23] then just kind of became Bitcoin only
[29:26] and uh yeah and then that's kind of it
[29:29] you know I've invested a ton into that
[29:31] and you know obviously been mining and
[29:33] you know um with we started a business
[29:36] me and another partner out out west in
[29:38] Vancouver and and all it's just about
[29:40] helping more like not industrial mines
[29:43] but helping small scale Miners And even
[29:45] businesses you know just adopt Bitcoin
[29:48] you know and that's kind of where that's
[29:50] kind of my story I guess that's an
[29:52] amazing story like you should share it
[29:56] that's
[29:58] I see a lot of I posted I think like a
[30:00] few days ago where you start with
[30:03] Bitcoin then you start in as being a
[30:05] crypto expert having like 20 30 40 coins
[30:09] I see hear someone with like 100 or over
[30:13] 100 coins I don't know how to can how
[30:16] you can possibly track them all uh and
[30:18] then you slowly get into really being
[30:22] educated on bitcoin and getting to less
[30:24] and less coins and like I see more and
[30:27] more people are just pivoting back to
[30:29] bitcoin only being on that more signal
[30:31] and less noise space and especially with
[30:35] Layer Two like you also have it you have
[30:38] lightning uh payments I think as a word
[30:41] in the bio and what what do you think
[30:44] about all the layer two solutions and
[30:46] how basically they are they could
[30:49] replace all the alt coins uh with the
[30:52] use cases they have yeah I I definitely
[30:55] the payments okay so I I go back I was
[30:57] um I was Consulting at the central bank
[30:59] I wasn't working on it but I was
[31:01] Consulting on um they had payments rails
[31:05] so right now the payments Canada who you
[31:08] know they're working on like a realtime
[31:11] rail they've been working on this for
[31:12] like ages and ages trying to speed up
[31:15] the settlement because again Banks they
[31:17] still run cobal systems they're so
[31:19] batch-based like they're so Antiquated
[31:22] because again the people running those
[31:25] institutions are not technology
[31:27] right they don't understand the
[31:29] technology they they hardly understand
[31:31] their wire system let alone you know
[31:33] lightning and Bitcoin right so so to me
[31:36] I think we're early days in that space
[31:39] and I think we're we're going to see
[31:41] more and more um adoption of Layer Two
[31:44] um Bitcoin moves slower than everybody
[31:46] else right because it's consensus based
[31:49] it's not there's no CEO that says I've
[31:51] decided we're launching on Monday right
[31:53] it everything takes way longer in
[31:56] Bitcoin but to me
[31:57] if it takes longer that means it's going
[31:59] to last longer it's going to be around
[32:01] for decades not a decade right and so I
[32:06] I think we're just in the early days I
[32:07] think there's a lot of use case work
[32:09] needed on on the layer twos in terms or
[32:12] sorry user experience work that's needed
[32:14] you know to simplify it you know running
[32:17] a node is challenging for the average
[32:19] Joe um sending lightning is still
[32:22] challenging for the average Joe so I
[32:24] think there's a lot of work we need to
[32:26] do in in in that in that user experience
[32:29] but I definitely think it's coming you
[32:30] know and we'll see other layer twos um
[32:33] the chain cache the ecash stuff is
[32:36] really interesting I think we're going
[32:37] to see you know uh things like that grow
[32:40] where you can do Anonymous uh
[32:42] transactions so yeah I don't know I I
[32:44] think that space is going to grow I
[32:45] think we're just in the we're still in
[32:46] the experimental phase you know
[32:48] lightning is a is a new um payment kind
[32:51] of approach a new payment technology um
[32:54] but I think on the digital world like
[32:57] you know this whole concept of micro
[32:59] payments on the internet has been a a
[33:00] pipe dream you know for digital
[33:02] marketers for a long time you know I
[33:04] don't know if you check out um stacker
[33:06] news have you ever been on stacker news
[33:08] yeah right so you know how you can
[33:09] basically you know you know few STS here
[33:12] I think that's what's going to be the
[33:14] the killer app for payments and get
[33:16] people into this is when when tools like
[33:19] that make it easy to use lightning like
[33:21] you don't even know you're using
[33:22] lightning you know you're just kind of
[33:23] like zap zap zap cool and then I've got
[33:26] a wallet and oh how I've got a balance
[33:28] in my wallet so you know that Reddit
[33:31] experience you know has nothing to do
[33:34] with lightning but they're using
[33:35] lightning right and so to me those are
[33:37] the kind of experiences which will
[33:39] escalate this people will use it without
[33:41] knowing under toine technology just like
[33:44] we have TCP IP today nobody ever talks
[33:46] about TCP IP but everything we do on the
[33:49] internet uses TCP IP it's the protocol
[33:51] for communication whereas Bitcoin
[33:55] lightning bitcoin's the money protocol
[33:57] lightning is the payments protocol right
[33:59] and so to me we're just learning how to
[34:01] apply those protocols you know in our
[34:04] digital space so I I think they're going
[34:06] to grow I it's just a matter of time and
[34:09] and and because it's built on bitcoin
[34:12] right you know people may have faster
[34:14] payments in other shitcoins and stuff
[34:16] like that but you know it all comes back
[34:18] to you know the gold right the gold is
[34:21] the Bitcoin today right and to me that's
[34:23] the that's the peg that really kind of
[34:26] anchors all this stuff and so you know
[34:29] people aren't going to be going and
[34:30] hunting for an avac this and that and
[34:32] and you know this token that's going to
[34:34] f like there's a small group of people
[34:36] that will go after those right like
[34:38] that's why that industry exists but
[34:40] mainstream adoption is not going to
[34:41] happen you know through those types of
[34:43] vehicles I don't think I'm super excited
[34:46] to announce that this podcast just got
[34:49] the first ever sponsor I just started
[34:52] the podcast out like three months ago
[34:55] and now we have 20 Bitcoin as a partner
[34:59] for this podcast 21 Bitcoin is Bitcoin
[35:03] only from day one and they teach and
[35:06] preach self custody this is my goto
[35:10] exchange when someone asks me oh where
[35:12] can I buy my Bitcoin from this is the
[35:15] easiest entry for bitcoiners and if you
[35:19] want lower fees Plus at the same time
[35:22] support this podcast use code Robin and
[35:25] click the link in the description yeah
[35:27] and I think this is also great point you
[35:30] talked about uh most people will never
[35:33] understand Bitcoin but they just will
[35:34] use it they have like layer two layer
[35:37] five layer layer 10 I don't know how
[35:39] many layers we are building on top of
[35:41] Bitcoin but they will use it at some
[35:43] capacity like maybe there is a like
[35:45] button on Twitter where you can just
[35:46] press and there's like one Satoshi
[35:48] sending uh to that user or like
[35:51] streaming on on podcasts uh with like
[35:54] apps like fountain or stacker news like
[35:56] there's so many possib possibilities you
[35:57] can integrate and monetize with uh
[36:00] lightning and with the Bitcoin protocol
[36:02] as a base layer and there's a lot of uh
[36:06] new things coming and as you said we are
[36:08] just in the beginning so like we are we
[36:10] are like before the 2000s in the in the
[36:13] the internet uh real so that's really
[36:17] interesting and yeah I I I I lived that
[36:20] that early 2000s like watching the
[36:22] internet grow and like you know I was
[36:24] teaching businesses to set up a VPN and
[36:26] they're like what's that and you know
[36:28] like and now we're there now it's like
[36:29] oh you need to set up a lightning node
[36:30] what's that you know like we're back in
[36:32] that same world and and just it's a
[36:34] whole new Evolution you know and I I I
[36:37] also think like there's things like um
[36:39] like where nosters coming in and stuff
[36:41] like that like I've really been looking
[36:43] at Noster marketplaces you know like
[36:45] those are the kinds of use cases that
[36:48] will and user experiences that'll bring
[36:49] more people right it's like oh you can
[36:51] build this store that's totally
[36:52] uncensorable you know and you know you
[36:55] can pay with this and so you know yeah
[36:57] that's what that's what's going to
[36:58] happen right it's going to be and like
[37:00] even you can log in with lightning now
[37:02] you know some apps are like log in with
[37:03] your lightning address so those kinds of
[37:05] things you know if you can explain that
[37:08] simple hurdle log in with lightning you
[37:11] know now you're in the ecosystem you've
[37:13] done one kind of you know activity of
[37:15] logging in now you got a wallet you got
[37:17] all this stuff you can accept and you
[37:19] can pay like if you can get that use
[37:21] case or that user experience you know
[37:23] very streamlined and very simple you're
[37:26] going to onboard a whole bunch of people
[37:27] then all of a sudden boom you've got
[37:28] people you know with lightning addresses
[37:31] and you know they start getting like
[37:33] they get SATs and now they're like oh
[37:35] I've got some how do I spend them right
[37:36] and so to me that's those kinds of
[37:38] things and educating people on that flow
[37:41] creating those new behaviors and new
[37:43] habits is is what's going to you know
[37:46] grow this in the long ter that's amazing
[37:48] because when Bitcoin adoption and lating
[37:50] adoption all the things that are coming
[37:52] in that space is growing and growing um
[37:56] and you have a background in in Central
[37:57] Bank basically worked in the fat world
[38:00] do you see Fe fat ever dying off or like
[38:04] do you see like maybe it's surviving 50
[38:07] years 100 years it's a tough one you
[38:10] know I don't think it's going to be it's
[38:12] going to be a long time you know they're
[38:14] going to fight right like this to me
[38:15] you've got people that are you know that
[38:17] are in charge of the Fiat that are going
[38:20] to fight for it you know and I think we
[38:23] see glimmers of these in the places that
[38:25] have hyperinflation like vene Venezuela
[38:27] you know these places where the cash is
[38:29] is literally in the streets right US
[38:32] Canada like European like those are I
[38:36] don't know those are like our big
[38:38] economies right so how how are they
[38:40] gonna I think it's going to be a long
[38:42] time I think we're going to live in a
[38:43] world where we have multiple um you know
[38:47] Vehicles multiple
[38:48] currencies um but but it it's going to
[38:51] evolve slowly you know like El Salvador
[38:53] is a good example of you know the
[38:56] direction we're going in but all these
[38:58] things take like they take like Black
[39:01] Swan events you know major events it was
[39:03] a major event that shifted Behavior you
[39:06] know all of a sudden everybody knows how
[39:08] to do a zoom call you know everybody
[39:10] knows to work for anywhere like remote
[39:12] work I was doing that I've been doing
[39:14] remote work for decades you know I know
[39:16] how to use all the tools but it was
[39:18] amazing when we went remote like my kids
[39:21] teachers at school were like blank face
[39:24] they're like how do I run a a a you know
[39:26] a web class like they had no clue right
[39:29] but they were forced into it right and
[39:31] we had a huge there was a huge education
[39:34] on how to use zoom and teams and how to
[39:36] do remote work and everybody was forced
[39:39] into that that big event had a huge
[39:41] behavioral change some for positive some
[39:43] for not so positive but but those are
[39:46] the types of events that really become
[39:48] tipping points right where where you
[39:50] have to you know you shift your behavior
[39:53] right like um you know you see this
[39:55] happens when uh
[39:56] like up here we have a um Canada Post
[39:59] you know they're our mail carrier right
[40:02] and in the in the early days uh when
[40:04] FedEx and uh ups and they were all
[40:07] getting on the Internet you know and
[40:09] they were shipping packages and all that
[40:11] you know they the our our local post
[40:14] office and all the people went on strike
[40:16] right so they went on strike and what
[40:18] that did was all these businesses that
[40:21] would ship product around with with this
[40:23] Canada Post this government kind of mail
[40:25] agency all of a sudden couldn't right
[40:27] because they were on strike and then
[40:29] they so that event caused them to shift
[40:31] their behavior I'm going to use FedEx
[40:33] well do you think they ever came back to
[40:34] Canada Post and they never did right
[40:37] they shifted that behavior their work
[40:39] processes now go through FedEx they've
[40:41] integrated FedEx with their company it's
[40:43] like you lost that business that big
[40:45] event you know changed the course of
[40:47] things so governments screw up right and
[40:50] I think if we have big Bank runs or you
[40:53] know we're having bank failures like
[40:55] crazy if that happens again those types
[40:57] of events say well screw all these
[41:00] talking heads that keep telling me on
[41:02] CNBC that you know invest in JP Morgan
[41:05] invest in me invest in our big
[41:07] institution you know their time is up
[41:10] they're going to screw up and they're
[41:12] gonna to me that those types of events
[41:14] will push people into Bitcoin it'll make
[41:16] them go I want something that's not
[41:18] controlled by the elite you know and
[41:20] what is that well there's only one thing
[41:23] you know and so I think the more people
[41:25] kind of have those experiences where
[41:27] they they've been burned by the central
[41:30] authorities and then those types of
[41:32] events will will push more and more
[41:33] people in but you know I I think we're
[41:36] going to be it's it's going to be a
[41:37] fight you know it's going to be a point
[41:39] where people want to you know those
[41:41] Central Bankers are going to want to
[41:43] maintain their their control and
[41:45] Authority that they have today so I
[41:47] don't know it's going to be a I don't
[41:48] know if I'll see it in my time you know
[41:51] so I I think my kids might see something
[41:53] close to it but you know this generation
[41:56] these are generational changes you know
[41:58] we we have a whole generation that
[42:00] didn't grow up on the internet but they
[42:02] used internet in their work and those
[42:05] are the people that are not I would call
[42:07] them more like digital tourists rather
[42:09] than digital natives so they're they're
[42:12] you know they're not as embracing of
[42:15] technology so when those people leave
[42:16] the workforce and Gen X and Millennials
[42:19] and even our Alpha generation like my
[42:21] kids who are you know under 10 years old
[42:24] you know they grew up in digital you
[42:26] know they've been trading billions of
[42:27] dollars of tokens on Roblox and you know
[42:31] Minecraft and all these games so I think
[42:33] those Generations are going to come in
[42:35] and Bitcoin is going to be intuitive to
[42:37] them it's going to make sense because
[42:39] they're not you know burdened by the old
[42:42] Fiat system so to me it's going to take
[42:44] it's going to take Generations where we
[42:46] have you know digital leaders actually
[42:49] running most of our institutions rather
[42:52] than you know digital tourists that are
[42:53] kind of like oh God I got to use email
[42:56] you know versus I only use email or
[42:59] whatever right whatever the tech is yeah
[43:01] and I also think uh like we see more and
[43:04] more places that they like consol
[43:06] consolidate the fat currenc is basically
[43:08] like a lot of countries that are not in
[43:10] the US but using the US dollar because
[43:13] their own currency went bust and it's
[43:16] interesting as you mentioned the example
[43:18] of El Salvador they also have no
[43:21] currency of their own they use the US
[43:22] dollar but they have the vision to be
[43:25] independent from the US dollar because
[43:26] they see the disadvantages of being on
[43:29] the US dollar without controlling the US
[43:30] dollar and so they're like if we cannot
[43:33] have a currency that we can control
[43:35] maybe we should have a currency that
[43:37] nobody can control like
[43:39] Bitcoin and uh that that would be really
[43:42] interesting uh if Salvador is like the
[43:45] role model or the example that will play
[43:47] out the next five 10 years because now
[43:49] it's early like now we can just see a
[43:51] little bit how salv plays out it's just
[43:53] a few years now but if it's five 10
[43:56] years you can really see results and
[43:57] then you can maybe see how how the the
[44:00] econ economy works and now and this how
[44:03] much better is from from like five 10
[44:06] years and more and more countries will
[44:07] involve it like there's a lot of
[44:09] interesting things going on I think yeah
[44:13] I I like that I I think El Salvador
[44:16] again in the banking world again they're
[44:18] not digital natives you know El Salvador
[44:21] has a digital native leader right he
[44:24] gets Bitcoin let alone technology and
[44:27] and central banks all these financial
[44:30] institutions they're all slow followers
[44:32] they're slow to adopt and and I've been
[44:35] in there I've been in that fight trying
[44:36] to convince you know I remember a
[44:38] project I did at the central bank and I
[44:39] was trying to convince them to go to
[44:41] like a digital trading platform they're
[44:43] like Chief investment officer wanted to
[44:46] stay in like Excel to manage trades and
[44:49] stuff right like he was resistant he was
[44:51] an older gentleman you know in his 70s
[44:53] and he didn't want all this new trading
[44:55] technology
[44:57] um actually limited them right he
[44:59] limited his decision making he could
[45:00] make off-the-cuff decisions whereas you
[45:03] know the trading systems that we
[45:04] eventually did Implement you know would
[45:06] control things you can't you know the
[45:07] Investment Portfolio you know was
[45:10] managed by the technology no you can't
[45:11] invest in those because it doesn't meet
[45:13] our investment policy you know oh you
[45:15] can't invest in that because it goes
[45:17] against this all those systems were
[45:19] being put in place and they didn't want
[45:20] that like this guy was this is again I
[45:23] go back to the Central Banking his
[45:25] behavior he was the old school you know
[45:27] he's probably in his 80s now that
[45:29] gentleman right so he was the old
[45:30] banking you know old gray-haired men
[45:33] banking kind of industry and his
[45:36] philosophy was like very much of
[45:41] like ego- driven in a lot of ways you
[45:44] like I could feel it right it was like
[45:45] he was in charge of 15 billion in cash
[45:48] he decided where it went and no systems
[45:50] were going to you know touch his process
[45:53] he's doing what he wanted the way he
[45:55] wanted right and you put systems in
[45:57] place and you put audit in place and all
[46:00] those things and they didn't like that
[46:02] right so that to me again was a big
[46:04] insight into like the Central Banking
[46:06] ethos of how you know what they say and
[46:09] what they do are two different things
[46:11] right and I just that's again what
[46:13] pushed me more into Bitcoin as I learned
[46:15] more about you know money and the the
[46:17] state controlling the money and stuff
[46:19] and it was like I almost started getting
[46:20] angry because I actually had firsthand
[46:22] experience of of the philosophy in those
[46:26] leaders right like I was working with
[46:27] this person across the room you know
[46:29] trying to implement modernized
[46:32] technology that will make the business
[46:33] better will make things more safe and
[46:36] secure and incompliant and all these
[46:37] different things and he was like no
[46:39] thanks you know and I'm like what you
[46:43] know until eventually the company did
[46:45] like he he ended up leaving because
[46:47] again he was he was just not ready for
[46:49] the future you know which was you know
[46:52] digital Banking and digital Finance you
[46:54] know back in those days where it was
[46:55] just stting it was just starting to grow
[46:57] and you know fintech was just a brand
[46:58] new thing so so you I I think they those
[47:01] guys want to hold on to that their
[47:03] control but again that's a per that
[47:06] Central Bank was a perfect example those
[47:08] big changes didn't happen till he was
[47:11] gone right till the new generation came
[47:13] in and was you know bringing uh a
[47:17] digital mentality to that job where it's
[47:19] like how do we automate our processes
[47:21] how do we streamline how do we use
[47:23] technology to make our treasury better
[47:26] and so that's how I see things as well
[47:28] with all of this stuff is we have
[47:31] digital tourists running these things
[47:33] you look at everybody that's running a
[47:34] central bank they're all Boomers and
[47:36] they're all like you know over 65 you
[47:40] know 65 to 75 years old and and that's
[47:44] not a problem except when you know
[47:47] technology is what underpins our
[47:50] economic system now and if you don't
[47:53] understand that and or you come from a
[47:56] central mentality where it's like we
[47:58] want to control and track everything and
[48:00] audit everything and have complete
[48:02] control that's a perspective they come
[48:04] at it from and so they they have those
[48:06] blinders of like this is why we have
[48:08] cbdcs coming right they want full
[48:10] auditability I want to know what you're
[48:11] doing when you do it who's doing it with
[48:13] who like they want to track all of that
[48:15] stuff and that's how they see technology
[48:17] advancing because those Technologies
[48:20] keep their control right so I I think
[48:24] it's going to take generation change for
[48:26] for us to you know get rid of paper
[48:28] dollars and the US dollar will be the
[48:30] last one standing for sure it's
[48:32] definitely the the strongest Fier
[48:34] currency and it will like it's the uh
[48:38] the the oneeyed under the blind like I
[48:41] want to say and I think also cbdcs is
[48:44] kind of the the the the try to keep the
[48:49] control longer and deeper like with cbcs
[48:53] they have possibilities that they didn't
[48:55] had before for like programmability of
[48:57] money you can program all do you have
[48:59] that like if they collect all the data
[49:02] of you and then they also have the the
[49:05] money part where they can uh tie the
[49:08] data of you with the money and I I'm I'm
[49:13] I'm usually really cautious with saying
[49:16] that oh they are having a bad plan they
[49:18] have like a really really they want to
[49:19] control the world they want to control
[49:21] everything like I'm I'm really cautious
[49:23] of that saying that uh but even putting
[49:26] those system in place can be dangerous
[49:28] because it's just a matter of time till
[49:31] someone comes and abuses those system
[49:34] like even if if everyone now involved is
[49:37] really uh holy and says like I don't
[49:40] want to do anything wrong and they are
[49:42] really good people which I don't think
[49:44] they are but even if you assume
[49:46] everybody involved is really a good
[49:48] person there's just a matter of time
[49:51] that someone comes around and abuses the
[49:53] system of having all the data and having
[49:55] the money part to control all of the the
[49:58] things and it's it's it's a scary BL but
[50:00] yeah they will control it a little
[50:02] longer I would agree with you I don't
[50:04] think they're malicious in it I think
[50:06] they're ignorant so if if again my
[50:09] history of the internet and and going
[50:11] back you know in the 90s and 2000s it
[50:14] was all about
[50:15] centralization right Central authorities
[50:18] in technology like you know we we now
[50:20] have a central authority of retail it's
[50:22] called Amazon you know we have a central
[50:24] Authority for our our online email it's
[50:27] called Google Gmail right like we have
[50:30] you know you go into
[50:32] organizations uh you know we have a
[50:34] central tool that manages all of our
[50:36] users at a bank right it's called you
[50:38] know Microsoft Exchange you know we have
[50:40] a central tool for uh our insurance
[50:43] policies right we we we put them all
[50:45] into this system and we centralize all
[50:47] of our things and so people in finance
[50:51] people that are in those positions in
[50:53] these central banks they have a
[50:54] centralized ation mentality because
[50:56] that's where we've been with technology
[50:58] when they you know when they learned
[51:00] about tech it was at work right and it
[51:03] was about hey we're going to centralize
[51:04] our email we're gonna like the whole
[51:06] modeling of technology has been
[51:08] centralizing client server you know
[51:10] we're going to centralize all your
[51:12] design in canva right so to me
[51:16] people's uh application of a of
[51:19] technology for many years was how do we
[51:21] centralize this right eBay all the how
[51:24] do we centralize you know auctions so
[51:26] when people think of new technologies
[51:29] they they they're thinking with a
[51:30] centralization mentality right so like
[51:33] you said like they're going to build
[51:34] these Technologies oh a cbdc oh we'll
[51:36] centralize we'll have all you know we'll
[51:39] have all this control and we can keep
[51:40] things safe and you know they think of
[51:42] it that's Central to them is about
[51:44] safety and about control right like we
[51:47] trust that Amazon's going to control
[51:49] their servers and and that our content
[51:51] and everything is going to be safe in
[51:52] there and that's been proven right for
[51:54] the most part
[51:55] right we've had lots of hacks and leaks
[51:57] but you know that centralization model
[51:59] for that generation has has worked and
[52:02] so when you talk about technology they
[52:04] instantly go to how do we centralize
[52:06] this whereas now bitcoin's bought
[52:08] brought this decentralized thinking
[52:10] right and it's a whole different
[52:11] Paradigm they're like what like it you
[52:15] know who would understand
[52:16] decentralization more is their parents
[52:19] like my great grandparents people that
[52:21] are in their 90s you know and older
[52:23] would understand decentralization
[52:25] because they grew up on farms where they
[52:27] had to be off they were off- grid right
[52:29] they had to decentralize they had to
[52:31] figure out how to get electricity in the
[52:33] 1950s you know they they had to figure
[52:36] out how to do plumbing on their own they
[52:37] weren't connecting to a central plumbing
[52:39] system like a a sewer system they were
[52:42] they had their own septic system so
[52:44] decentralized septic versus centralized
[52:47] septic so to me we we shifted right we
[52:49] got the old generation was decentralized
[52:52] because that's just the way life was and
[52:55] then we moved to centralization because
[52:56] it brought a lot of efficiencies but now
[52:58] the pendulum swung too far all that
[53:00] centralization also means we've
[53:02] centralized control and there was no
[53:04] mechanism before and now we've got a
[53:06] mechanism that allows to decentralize
[53:08] trust and so they don't get that so to
[53:11] me you know that I don't think it's
[53:14] malicious you know the people at the we
[53:16] and stuff like that I I think they're
[53:17] just operating in a different mind space
[53:20] where they think centralization is good
[53:23] it allows us to you know control and
[53:25] distribute resources right and so you're
[53:28] right most of them aren't malicious but
[53:30] you know what happens when someone goes
[53:31] oh wow we have all this control and we
[53:34] have all this money and you know if a
[53:37] political will just says hey we want to
[53:40] do this well now you just have to press
[53:42] the button right it's not about you know
[53:45] building it it's about pressing the
[53:47] button right and so that's what I worry
[53:49] about too because that's way easier to
[53:52] to do than to re than to create
[53:54] something different you know it's
[53:56] already there it's already like the
[53:58] possibility is there and um we are
[54:00] having an end routine in the podcast
[54:02] where like the previous guest asked the
[54:05] next guest a question uh the idea is
[54:07] wonderfully stolen from the Diary of a
[54:09] CEO if you listen to the podcast I love
[54:12] it and your question from the previous
[54:15] guest is an interesting one who is your
[54:18] favorite
[54:19] ple my favorite what ple ple oh jeez
[54:24] who's my favorite pleb I don't even know
[54:27] that's I don't know I like BTC sessions
[54:31] he's a local Canadian here he uh you
[54:33] know he does a um similar to what you're
[54:35] doing you know he gets people on um I he
[54:38] recently introduced me to somebody here
[54:39] in Manitoba that that's in Bitcoin and
[54:42] I've been connecting with him and I just
[54:43] learned more about Ben uh you know I've
[54:45] never met him but I just love what he's
[54:47] doing uh you know I think he's he's
[54:50] doing a lot for Bitcoin and helping
[54:52] people get into it and and he's just a
[54:54] friendly face you know he's just a nice
[54:56] friendly person that's
[54:58] not again bitcoin's intimidating we need
[55:01] friendly faces we need people to be like
[55:03] you know here's how it works and don't
[55:04] be intimidated and I think he's really
[55:06] good in that regards you know educating
[55:08] people um you know and just carrying on
[55:11] the Discord in a respectful manner you
[55:13] know I'm not always the most respectful
[55:15] I like posting and stuff like that
[55:17] but you know I I think you know he he's
[55:20] a he's definitely really good bitcoiner
[55:23] out there he he's amazing I love
[55:26] following him and he will also be on the
[55:28] the podcast soon I guess uh I'm in
[55:30] contact with him and yeah he's like one
[55:32] of Awesome The Great Canadians like I
[55:35] think he will be like my fourth Canadian
[55:37] on the on the show oh that's great
[55:39] that's good yeah no it's
[55:42] um we've got lots of electricity here
[55:44] like you know I think that's why Bitcoin
[55:46] is a you know could do lots of good
[55:49] things here you know like BC has a lot
[55:51] of hydroelectric uh Power that's where
[55:54] um oh no I think Ben's in Alberta but
[55:56] BC's got a lot Manitoba and then also
[55:59] Quebec where there's a lot of mines in
[56:01] Quebec as well so I just think and we
[56:03] can all we already have a Bitcoin e ETF
[56:05] here in Canada we had it for a long time
[56:07] like it's it's not like a big
[56:09] announcement like it was in the states
[56:10] so people can already do that and then I
[56:14] don't know well we've got pretty lack
[56:16] not lack but we've got a legal framework
[56:19] for Bitcoin so you got companies like
[56:20] bull Bitcoin in Canada you know they you
[56:23] know they're operating and you know they
[56:25] have a a fin Trak license they have to
[56:27] do kyc for some large transactions like
[56:30] we've got rules like that but but for
[56:32] the most part you know Canada is
[56:33] welcoming to Bitcoin in a lot of ways so
[56:36] I think that's just going to evolve as
[56:38] knowledge grows and stuff so but we are
[56:41] where we are agreed um where can people
[56:44] find you the
[56:45] best uh so I'm definitely on Twitter
