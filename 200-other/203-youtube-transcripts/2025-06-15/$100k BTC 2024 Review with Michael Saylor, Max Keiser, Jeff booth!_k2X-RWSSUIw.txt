[00:00] 95% of the economic benefit from the
[00:04] arrival of the ETFs has gone to the
[00:06] bitcoiners that don't have ETFs you know
[00:09] Bitcoin is going to at least equal the
[00:11] market capitalization of gold in dollar
[00:13] terms so you've got now a 13 14x just to
[00:16] get to gold which is a lot higher than
[00:18] the current price and then of course it
[00:20] should exceed gold it should also
[00:21] demonetize bond market demonetize the
[00:24] property Market demonetize the stock
[00:26] market so now you're talking about
[00:28] Bitcoin worth 100 trillion 200 trillion
[00:31] 300 trillion I would look at this as a 4
[00:34] to 8 yearold the play here is to buy it
[00:36] put it away safely continue to buy it on
[00:39] a daily cost
[00:41] [Music]
[00:45] basis hi and welcome to one of my really
[00:49] really rare instances where I do in Solo
[00:53] episode and today we review the top 10
[00:56] Bitcoin videos on my channel featuring
[01:00] Michaela Max Kaiser Jeff poof all the
[01:02] big ones obviously top 10 videos of 350
[01:06] videos an amazing thing uh really let's
[01:09] get into it and the first video that I
[01:12] want to show you guys obviously uh it is
[01:17] with top video top 10 video is uh Fred
[01:22] Krueger the math medition fed crudder uh
[01:25] nobody wants US dollar in 10 years I
[01:28] agree with that
[01:30] I I don't want I don't want any fear
[01:33] currency now at all uh and it's it's not
[01:37] 10 years uh since that video it's just
[01:39] five months from that video so let's
[01:41] look at the video then let's look at the
[01:43] comments and then uh let's go from there
[01:46] well I mean the yeah I mean it's gr at
[01:48] it's growing kind of at the the 12th
[01:51] power of
[01:52] time so if you you know if you look at
[01:55] these power law models right uh it you
[01:59] know the price is going up relative to
[02:02] the six power of time so bitcoin price
[02:04] is going to the time measured uh from
[02:07] the you know from say 2010 right or 2009
[02:11] whatever you want to do for let's just
[02:13] say 2010 which was sort of the first
[02:15] prices of Bitcoin right so if you look
[02:18] at uh time from
[02:20] 2010 and uh and you know and you look at
[02:24] the price of Bitcoin it's gone up at the
[02:27] P time to the power six roughly
[02:30] if you look at hash rate it's gone up at
[02:33] the square of that so time to the power
[02:35] of
[02:36] 12 and if you look at adoption is sort
[02:38] of time to the power cubed roughly so
[02:42] there's there's a very
[02:44] clear kind of growth U model for Bitcoin
[02:48] with these power laws kind of you know
[02:51] they're
[02:52] not you
[02:55] know you can you could say they're kind
[02:57] of a religion I do think that they're
[02:59] rather amazing but there is a clear
[03:02] pattern of we've got this adoption
[03:05] that's leading to this price and that's
[03:07] leading to this hash rate for for the
[03:10] few people that might never heard of the
[03:12] power I feel like right now most of them
[03:15] heard about it what what is it and why
[03:16] is it so intrig intriguing for you well
[03:20] it's the Intriguing thing is that
[03:25] um
[03:26] Bitcoin if you look at Bitcoin and
[03:29] you're just looking at it without
[03:30] looking at it in log log terms right if
[03:34] you're just looking at it normally your
[03:36] your narrative is this thing is very
[03:38] risky right and it goes up it went up a
[03:42] lot in 2018 or was 2017 it crashed in
[03:45] 2018 it went up a lot in 2020 it crashed
[03:48] in
[03:48] 2022 uh now it's back up but it just
[03:52] seems completely volatile right like why
[03:55] would there's no Rhyme or Reason to this
[03:57] thing it goes up it goes down it crashes
[03:59] now if you look at it on a log basis
[04:03] where bitcoin price is on a log it looks
[04:05] like well it's going up but it's sort of
[04:07] like going up a little less fast and
[04:10] then if you look at it on a log log
[04:11] basis you're like oh wow this thing is
[04:13] kind of a line right it's going up in a
[04:15] linear fashion very
[04:17] predictably uh with actually sort of a
[04:21] reasonable volatility to it in log log
[04:23] terms so I think it's a it's it's an
[04:27] important um discovery
[04:30] uh that uh that Bitcoin actually is is
[04:34] obeying this very sort of regular
[04:38] progression and um and this Italian uh
[04:43] physicist Giovani kind of first observed
[04:47] this and you know pointed it out and
[04:50] nobody cared and uh you know he he was
[04:53] sort of ignored and uh you know and he
[04:57] sort of uh one of one of the things I've
[04:59] tried to do is try to explain to people
[05:02] what he's what he did you know and so I
[05:05] sort of saying look you should give give
[05:08] the man some credit he found this this
[05:10] uh this incredible this incredible
[05:13] relationship that's an amazing thing uh
[05:17] already yeah um Fred
[05:20] Krueger uh the 10th one obviously it's
[05:23] the power law has to be in some way
[05:26] shape or form in that top 10 uh and uh
[05:30] deserved like that like the power law
[05:31] was a big discussion right now it feels
[05:33] like there's a little bit of a off
[05:35] cooling for the power law uh maybe this
[05:38] comes back uh there's also another video
[05:42] of the power law and small spoiler it's
[05:45] not with Giovani Giani videos didn't
[05:47] make it Giovani videos I think it's in
[05:49] the top 30 top 20 or something like that
[05:52] but it's not in the top 10 videos um but
[05:56] another Power law video made it in there
[05:58] um and uh Fred Krueger made a really
[06:02] good job in explaining the power law and
[06:04] I think the power law is really good
[06:05] when we look at hash rate or if you look
[06:09] at Bitcoin versus gold uh when we look
[06:12] at the power LW in US dollar terms I
[06:15] think it will break to the upside
[06:17] completely at some point it didn't
[06:20] really break to the upside till now
[06:22] depending on how you look at what what
[06:24] the definition of praking of that model
[06:26] is um but uh I think it's a great base
[06:31] case for Bitcoin if you look like okay
[06:34] that that's kind of like an average or
[06:36] minimum price Target I can look at in US
[06:39] dollar terms but be prepared that that
[06:42] price Target might be higher than is
[06:46] actually uh turns out to be so yeah
[06:49] let's uh let's go back to to uh the
[06:53] mathemati Fred Krueger uh he does a
[06:56] really good job in explaining that let's
[06:57] see some some comments uh
[07:00] here what a time to be alive from from
[07:02] calvinia it's it's it it's actually
[07:05] crazy when you think about what what
[07:07] kind of um how how how grateful I am to
[07:12] be right here right now in this Bitcoin
[07:16] era where Bitcoin kind of just grows and
[07:19] we might experience right now the um
[07:23] creation the invention of the sound
[07:27] money which will be there for the next
[07:29] 100 next thousand next yeah maybe
[07:32] forever there maybe even for other
[07:34] planets I don't know uh it's really hard
[07:36] to say what's happening in thousands or
[07:38] tens of thousands of years but it will
[07:41] be really in really significant in the
[07:44] in the next in the coming years so from
[07:47] that standpoint on it is absolutely what
[07:50] a time to be live really grateful
[07:52] honestly to be that then we so lucky to
[07:55] be alive at the start of this yeah like
[07:57] he basically said the same thing again
[08:00] most underrated Bitcoin Channel you're
[08:02] always on your aame captain thank you so
[08:05] much Sal I think you also gave yeah
[08:08] exactly you gave me also 20 dollars here
[08:10] thank you so much for for that I really
[08:12] appreciate that really helps me out a
[08:13] lot to to monetize the channel and and
[08:15] get it going and maybe also get some
[08:17] post production in there uh Fred has
[08:20] been a breath of fresh air this year
[08:23] great conversation another top level
[08:26] guest this channel is gathering uh
[08:28] starting to get base yeah it's nice that
[08:31] the the top comments are also like about
[08:32] the channel and not only about the guest
[08:34] but the guest should be the the center
[08:37] Focus that's also another interesting
[08:39] thing Stevie the block size must never
[08:42] ever be changed computer chips and other
[08:45] Technologies must and will change for
[08:49] Bitcoin
[08:52] interesting I don't know um I think the
[08:55] block size we should not change I think
[08:58] there are more downsides than the upside
[09:00] is if we change the block size uh but
[09:05] that might be different when we look um
[09:10] let's say 100 years into the future
[09:12] because technology and the hardware will
[09:14] be so different that it might make just
[09:16] sense to double the block SI or
[09:19] something like that uh right now I it's
[09:21] a really hard no right now it's a really
[09:24] hard no to increasing the block size H
[09:27] but maybe uh in the future we we we we
[09:29] have to be at least open um to change
[09:34] Bitcoin if we really have to right now I
[09:37] really don't think that that's necessary
[09:39] uh and it's actually dangerous right now
[09:41] it would be very dangerous to to do that
[09:44] but let's move on to the number nine the
[09:48] top ninth episode of this year Bitcoin
[09:53] 2024 and it
[09:56] is Brian Harrington oh in 0.1 0.21
[10:02] Bitcoin is a big
[10:05] deal I agree 100% with that I agree more
[10:10] than 100% of that I even go ahead and
[10:13] say
[10:14] 0 uh
[10:15] 0.1 Bitcoin is a big deal uh depending
[10:19] on where you live and what what you are
[10:21] waiting for in in Bitcoin and what kind
[10:24] of uh you're looking forward to but
[10:26] let's say what's the um faith
[10:30] clip of this podcast uh what the
[10:33] audience watched the most so like how I
[10:35] saw the what's the most audience is like
[10:38] you have a retention rate that starts
[10:39] with 100% of the viewers and uh stops at
[10:42] like 10 20 30 40% of the viewers and in
[10:46] that line in that line of uh 100% to
[10:51] whatever the end percentage is it drops
[10:54] significantly in there but sometimes
[10:56] there like spikes in there or like
[10:58] people watch the uh part longer even
[11:01] though they didn't watch that so I I
[11:03] tried to find the highlight of the of
[11:06] the video and and that's the highlight
[11:07] of this video the way that I tackled the
[11:10] whole capital gains issue is when
[11:13] previously pre in my
[11:15] previously that was a mental barrier for
[11:18] me also because I'm you know lean
[11:21] libertarian lean smallart government
[11:23] lean whatever like Freedom as like you
[11:25] know as a lot of people do and for that
[11:28] for me it was like oh paying gital gains
[11:30] taxes is like antithetical because
[11:33] that's like continuing you know a vision
[11:35] of the world that I don't want to
[11:36] foresee right and so this whole thing of
[11:39] of keep your Bitcoin until such a future
[11:42] where Bitcoin replaces the dollar and
[11:44] that's like eventually overturned right
[11:46] like that kind a very classic classic
[11:48] thing what I didn't what's new now and
[11:53] what helped me click past this was
[11:56] owning Bitcoin like having a capital
[11:59] game means you made a gain like that's a
[12:03] good problem to have so connecting back
[12:05] to the influence part you know you hold
[12:08] a person a person holding Bitcoin
[12:11] instead of Fiat and making a game
[12:14] literally has more stored labor more
[12:19] potential now underneath their future
[12:21] self than if they had held the Fiat
[12:24] money like that's good the am the more
[12:27] amount of bitcoiners that can be the
[12:30] most amount of wealthy as possible means
[12:33] that the future that you and I are both
[12:34] interested in will happen as fast as
[12:37] possible and so for me that's the mental
[12:39] framework that changed combined with
[12:42] again the tools of fold in other places
[12:46] like tracking the capital gains even
[12:47] faster so that people so that it's not a
[12:49] headache it's not a headache you just
[12:51] receive a form the same yeah it's a it's
[12:53] an interesting point that he made and uh
[12:56] I never heard the point made before
[13:00] when uh I was on on the podcast and
[13:02] people talked about the medium of
[13:04] exchange size of things in Bitcoin
[13:06] because the thing you have to know is
[13:09] once you in most countries right now if
[13:12] you spend your Bitcoin you most likely
[13:16] have to pay capital gains tax um for
[13:21] example in Austria if you buy Bitcoin
[13:23] now and uh it goes up
[13:26] 50% uh and you sell it or you you spend
[13:28] it on even like a coffee even like
[13:31] something small or like something bigger
[13:33] like a a printer like who who buys
[13:35] printer these days I just saw a PR
[13:38] behind Brian hering so I was like
[13:40] printer but uh like something bigger
[13:42] also on the profits you made with that
[13:46] uh uh period of time in Bitcoin you have
[13:49] to pay 27% tax in America it's like 10
[13:53] to 20% or 30% I think even depending on
[13:56] long-term and short-term coule gain taxs
[13:58] I don't know exactly because I have no
[14:00] clue about the American tax system uh
[14:04] and uh maybe in some countries even up
[14:06] to 40 50% in some countries 5 to 10% uh
[14:11] but most countries except like Salvador
[14:14] I think Portugal and and some other
[14:16] countries don't have a capital gains tax
[14:17] on
[14:18] bitcoin um if you have to pay them you
[14:21] basically pay not only for the good and
[14:24] service that you pay for but you also
[14:26] have to spend the capital gains tax and
[14:29] Brian Harrington is making an
[14:32] interesting um mindset shift for that
[14:35] he's like if you don't hold any fear if
[14:38] you only hold
[14:39] Bitcoin um it is better because you make
[14:44] a profit from that so like if you hold
[14:46] the the the the fear for buying
[14:50] something where you hold the Bitcoin for
[14:52] buying something on feat you don't have
[14:54] to spend Capital uh you don't have to
[14:56] pay capital gains tax but on bitcoin you
[15:00] hold you only spend C gain tax on
[15:03] profits you
[15:04] made so if you are you if you're in loss
[15:08] you don't pay capital gains tax only if
[15:11] you up you have to pay C capital gains
[15:13] tax so in that way you can look at uh
[15:17] that spending event is being uh a good
[15:22] event for you because if you otherwise
[15:25] held the fat only uh you would have not
[15:29] made profits yes you have to pay money
[15:31] to to the government which is bad but
[15:34] otherwise you wouldn't have that money
[15:36] anyways um but then there's this whole
[15:39] borrowing against it or M getting in
[15:42] credit or and buying the credit off with
[15:44] Bitcoin like there's a lot of games you
[15:46] can play in that but the theory is
[15:48] really interesting to like if you just
[15:50] hold 100% Bitcoin uh and you pay things
[15:53] with Bitcoin uh it it really does make
[15:57] sense to to a larg degree for me at
[16:00] least uh even though I don't do that uh
[16:02] I many times on the podcast I revealed
[16:04] how I do it I have like a bank account
[16:06] which can go to up to $10,000 in the
[16:09] minus and I always keep it around the
[16:12] zero so like if uh if have high influx
[16:15] on income I uh spend it on bitcoin uh if
[16:20] I uh have to pay something and I'm
[16:24] getting into the minus I use the feeld
[16:26] that's coming in to pay up pay up the
[16:28] dept so I always try to get at zero to
[16:31] always have around 100% of Bitcoin um uh
[16:34] exposure I don't know if everyone can do
[16:37] that uh stuff but it's definitely it's
[16:41] for me the most
[16:43] uncomplicated uh and uh maximum maximum
[16:48] exposure
[16:50] uh strategy that I can can do right now
[16:54] but yeah let's move on to number eight
[16:58] we are already we are flying oh wait no
[17:01] no no no first we have to look at the
[17:03] comment section again um just seeing one
[17:07] or two uh good comments the
[17:10] decentralized aspect is huge it's like
[17:13] having a portable secure assets
[17:16] 100% what the little fish don't fully
[17:19] grasp is that the big fish are buying
[17:22] with no intention of ever selling that's
[17:24] a good one that that uh but
[17:31] never if you never sell your
[17:34] Bitcoin you also holding something else
[17:39] you pay your bills with which you means
[17:44] you could buy more
[17:46] Bitcoin so I agree with that uh mindset
[17:50] with never selling but you can use it to
[17:54] spend on something even though I don't
[17:56] do that but it's an leged strategy
[17:59] uh for for you to do DCA is the way to
[18:02] go uh DC way all this
[18:06] DCA DC DCA all the
[18:09] way oh forgot to like that one uh keep
[18:14] BDC as a store of value using Bitcoin to
[18:17] buy anything today will be extremely
[18:19] expensive tomorrow I don't agree with
[18:21] that that's why I didn't like it uh I I
[18:24] I I I don't agree with that because of
[18:28] the things that that just explained I
[18:30] probably answered the same thing um but
[18:33] yeah it's it it is it is an interesting
[18:36] discussion definitely but he explained
[18:39] In that clip really good why it does
[18:42] make sense uh uh perfect yeah let's see
[18:45] if there's anything else America great
[18:48] place just wish the population would
[18:49] stop overusing the word like in the kar
[18:52] it's painful I'm I'm super sorry I'm
[18:54] also doing that from time to time like
[18:58] now
[19:00] uh but it's uh it's definitely once you
[19:03] uh once you hear it you you cannot
[19:05] unhear it a lot of people say like too
[19:07] much including myself but yeah let's
[19:10] move on to number we had 10 we had nine
[19:14] and now we are at number eight and this
[19:18] is Chris Johnson Chris Johnson was a
[19:23] really cool guest and I liked him a lot
[19:26] uh and yeah he's the guy that says all
[19:29] in do everything you can to get to one
[19:33] Bitcoin let's go and let's see what he
[19:36] has to say um what do you think primed
[19:39] you to understand Bitcoin because I feel
[19:42] like uh even like there are a lot of
[19:44] Rich dudes a lot of smart dudes that
[19:46] have no clue about Bitcoin uh and it's
[19:49] just like a very small group of people
[19:52] that actually understand in Crash
[19:54] Bitcoin right now what do you think
[19:55] Prime you to to actually understand it
[19:58] all right so before I had any type of
[20:00] like real money like I was paying
[20:03] attention to bitcoin right so my first
[20:05] Bitcoin buy was in 2017 and it was
[20:08] strictly for the purpose of trying to
[20:10] make more money right so me and my
[20:12] cousin Johnny were just like halfway
[20:15] reading these books halfway kind of
[20:17] paying attention you know but we're just
[20:19] like we want the number to go up you
[20:20] know so I'm thinking I'm some mad
[20:23] scientist and I buy it 3,000 sell it
[20:26] 6,000 I think I'm the king of the world
[20:28] it goes up to 20,000 and then I'm
[20:30] sitting here looking at my cousin like
[20:32] bro what did we do wrong you know so
[20:34] then it crashes and then I'm like well I
[20:37] guess I did that right you know I didn't
[20:40] I didn't miss out so then what end up
[20:42] happening is like
[20:43] 2019 I'm like buying in as I'm starting
[20:46] making more money I'm buying in I would
[20:47] like I'd buy a whole coin for $4,000
[20:50] sell it for $7,000 or buy it for eight
[20:52] and sell for 12 and I'm just thinking
[20:54] I'm like thinking like a Trader you know
[20:57] but how the Sega go was like you come
[21:00] you come for the number go up and you
[21:01] stay for the revolution you know so then
[21:04] what would happen is I would start
[21:05] following traders who would like trade
[21:07] Bitcoin and you know I'm like all right
[21:08] this is pretty cool you know and then I
[21:12] started to find like uh people who were
[21:15] like very deeply into this you know like
[21:18] Naval for example right so you you know
[21:21] and follow
[21:22] Naval no no actually not
[21:26] oh maybe I know him profile but this
[21:29] name uh doesn't ring a bell no I'll I'll
[21:32] send you his profile he's some profound
[21:34] guy but he's a he's a uh um a angel
[21:37] investor in Silicone Valley but he's
[21:39] also like a philosopher right so I would
[21:42] like listen to some of the the um
[21:44] podcast and stuff he would do and he
[21:45] would talk about like the impact of
[21:47] cryptocurrency and things like that and
[21:49] then I'm like oh this is
[21:52] crazy you know who he is now I I know
[21:54] and I Googled him yeah I know this guy
[21:57] Nal can't yep so as I'm like listening
[22:01] to him and then like you know he would
[22:04] say little things like he has his old
[22:05] tweet that would say like um like
[22:09] basically you you're either left to play
[22:11] The Wealth game or the status game right
[22:14] so the status game is you know where you
[22:15] went to school kind of car you drive the
[22:17] jewelry you wear like who you hang out
[22:19] where you hang out with like that right
[22:21] or you can choose to play The Wealth
[22:22] game and the wealth game is how long can
[22:24] you survive without another paycheck so
[22:26] he said that and I'm like whoa like you
[22:28] know that's actually deep so I start
[22:30] paying attention to him start listening
[22:32] and then he kind of led me down this
[22:33] rabbit hole and I'm like man what okay
[22:35] why are these people buying Bitcoin and
[22:37] saying they're never going to sell when
[22:38] I'm just turning a profit like you know
[22:40] every few months so I started kind of
[22:43] paying attention and I'm like okay this
[22:44] is something that you can hold so then
[22:47] what happened is during covid when they
[22:50] printed off all that money I I already
[22:52] understood the impact of it you know
[22:54] what I'm like oh this is why people are
[22:57] like
[22:59] it's not necessarily a hedge to
[23:00] inflation but a solution to inflation
[23:02] right because at any given moment we're
[23:05] always one event away from them stroking
[23:08] the pin and now we're going to flood the
[23:10] whole global economy with more money and
[23:12] now the cost of living is going up and
[23:14] then you start to put two and two
[23:15] together like the the the price of these
[23:17] assets are going up because they're
[23:18] propped up by all the global liquidity
[23:20] you know or the M2 money supply the
[23:22] global money supply they send assets up
[23:24] they send you real estate up they
[23:26] they're what's propping you know Bitcoin
[23:28] to go to go up too you're like all this
[23:30] new money has to find a home right so if
[23:34] all this new money has to find a home
[23:35] and it's going to find a home in real
[23:36] estate well they're just going to make a
[23:38] build a house right next to yours right
[23:40] and or if you all this money finds a
[23:43] home in stocks and then the I don't know
[23:46] the company can say let's issue more
[23:47] shares so therefore you just been
[23:49] diluted and it's really interesting with
[23:52] um this one with Chris Johnson because
[23:55] that is pretty basic Bitcoin
[23:57] understanding but this part was actually
[23:59] the most uh watched one this was the one
[24:01] that was most repeated and I think that
[24:04] this and I saw it also in the statistics
[24:07] that this video got shared above my
[24:10] usual audience uh in in different kind
[24:13] of audience streaks so Chris Johnson is
[24:15] an interesting guest because I think he
[24:16] brings in
[24:19] um income business people that want to
[24:22] higher the income uh up their level
[24:25] their business level uh and not the
[24:28] usual Bitcoin a crowd even though the
[24:30] bitcoiners also highly interested in
[24:32] that of course because uh they want to
[24:34] hire their stack uh but it's a different
[24:37] crowd and and he um really gets them
[24:40] also in and that crowd really needs that
[24:42] basic Bitcoin understanding so I think
[24:44] that's why this uh mindset of like you
[24:48] don't trade it you just hold it uh why
[24:51] is Bitcoin going up why is it so scarce
[24:54] uh and why is it so much better than
[24:55] real estate why is it so much better
[24:57] than anything else like stocks I really
[24:59] got a lot of intention uh and yeah this
[25:01] was top seven like no like top eight
[25:05] video of uh uh of this year and it's a
[25:09] recent one it's like two months ago it's
[25:11] not even it's not even that far ago
[25:13] Chris Johnson is the BTC man but so is
[25:17] Robin S yeah hope I only do Rob I only
[25:20] do Bitcoin so I hope I'm getting to be
[25:24] the the Bitcoin
[25:25] man highly intelligent PR very awakened
[25:29] he's speaking the truth the most people
[25:32] don't want to accept thank you for
[25:34] showcasing more

[25:46] insights love his story and can tell
[25:49] he's very authentic genuine brother love
[25:51] how he puts his thoughts into
[25:53] perspective great Jam dropping session
[25:56] such an inspiration you guys are
[25:58] so happy to be part of this Bitcoin
[26:01] community so so glad to have you uh Nova
[26:05] or no Novak knet however you are called
[26:09] yeah it's a really cool Community the
[26:11] wealth Squad yeah that's I don't know
[26:13] what wealth Squad actually is I never
[26:14] asked him H but yeah Chris Johnson is is
[26:17] great uh I have one full coin and adding
[26:21] more each week also have msdr please
[26:23] never say how much Bitcoin you have in
[26:25] in public I think that's oh oh man I I'm
[26:29] super sorry I don't share my screen
[26:31] right now um I am super super duper
[26:35] sorry um here I am right now and you can
[26:39] see my screen again I was just reading
[26:42] the comments here highly intelligent
[26:43] prodct where very awakened uh came for
[26:46] the number go up stayed for the
[26:47] revolution great part exactly yeah and I
[26:51] was just saying here have it like it's
[26:53] great that you have one full coin but
[26:55] please don't tell anyone uh it's it's
[26:58] it's it's it's not good practice to uh
[27:01] tell your Bitcoin stack in in public if
[27:04] you do that it's your CH Choice like we
[27:07] we should Grant everyone the right the
[27:10] freedom to tell this I just want to
[27:13] bring get they get my duty out there and
[27:15] say don't do it uh really cool then
[27:18] let's move on to number seven we are
[27:22] coming to the top seven podcast of
[27:25] 350 episodes think about that 50
[27:28] episodes top seven that's like the
[27:31] that's the best out of the best uh this
[27:34] one is it um not Robin it's Jeff Bo Jeff
[27:39] poof it's the oldest one of the F of the
[27:44] top 10 it's nine months ago I think it
[27:47] was like March it was beginning of March
[27:49] end of February uh we can probably see
[27:51] it here yeah it was second of March uh
[27:55] this video and it was an absolute Banger
[27:57] it was the first video that shot up in
[28:00] in my uh in my videos and it was the
[28:04] first video that got me monetized this
[28:07] video literally monetized my channel uh
[28:10] this video gave me a lot of hope that I
[28:12] can actually do it and I released that
[28:15] on the first uh day where I didn't work
[28:20] like I worked till till end of February
[28:23] and March uh I think the 1 of March was
[28:26] a Sunday if I remember correctly might
[28:28] be wrong about that but I think 2nd of
[28:30] March was like uh a Monday maybe I'm
[28:34] wrong about that uh but I think it was
[28:36] the first or the second day um of where
[28:40] I didn't work anymore for for the
[28:42] company I worked before and the
[28:46] recording was two months before or like
[28:49] one months before something like that
[28:51] and this video literally was the video
[28:55] that gave me the confidence
[28:58] after the recording not after publishing
[29:00] and seeing the result after the
[29:02] recording already to to think about
[29:05] quitting my job that that was the
[29:07] defining moment for my channel to be
[29:09] honest talking to Jeff boo hearing him
[29:12] talk uh and also afterwards I asked him
[29:15] hey like in the end of the podcast I
[29:17] asked him hey uh what do you recommend
[29:20] young people and he's like go all in on
[29:21] bitcoin not ofice with your net worth
[29:23] but also with your time and it was it
[29:25] really hit home with me and I was like
[29:27] yeah like what am I doing like I'm I'm
[29:31] fulltime all in in Bitcoin with my money
[29:34] but I'm fulltime all in in it security
[29:37] with my time like what the hell I'm
[29:39] doing and that's what uh Jeff boo
[29:43] basically contributed to my channel not
[29:45] only monetize not only the first big
[29:48] video but the most thing that he
[29:50] contributed is making me quit my feia
[29:54] chob and making me go all in on bitcoin
[29:58] so thank you so much Jeff I will be
[30:00] forever grateful for for that
[30:02] inspiration that you give gave there and
[30:05] when I watched that I was like yeah nine
[30:07] months ago a lot happened in that nine
[30:10] months it feels
[30:13] like and when we like move fur in the
[30:17] future where like Bitcoin is like the
[30:21] standard um unit of account medium
[30:24] Exchange store value of of our um
[30:27] generation of our like living um what
[30:31] what is changing on like the
[30:34] entrepreneurial Spirit uh compared to
[30:37] like right right now like four 10 years
[30:40] ago so um nothing it
[30:45] accelerates um the and that acceleration
[30:50] is in service of all of us and so for
[30:53] for your new listeners there is no such
[30:56] thing and this is going to be hard for
[30:57] them understand because if they're
[30:59] living in a Fiat construct they're
[31:00] carrying all the bag their baggage
[31:02] forward so they're going to wonder how
[31:04] debt operates how um how how I buy a
[31:07] house without realizing that the price
[31:10] of the house today holds a monetary
[31:13] premium because people store their
[31:14] wealth there because if they stored it
[31:17] in the bank it loses value so and then
[31:20] and then then they have to have a house
[31:22] with a staggering mortgage just to try
[31:25] to get into the game and all all of that
[31:28] is stealing their time and energy to
[31:29] support the existing system whereas in
[31:31] the new system the house just keeps on
[31:33] falling in price forever to to its
[31:37] utility value and the utility value then
[31:39] Falls because the utility uh utility
[31:42] value of a house um it doesn't hold a
[31:45] monetary premium anymore it doesn't it's
[31:47] not a store of
[31:48] value right because Bitcoin becomes a
[31:51] better store of value and so as prices
[31:53] fall relative relative to bitcoin you
[31:55] need way less debt to service it
[31:58] and and so that's just one example but
[32:01] political systems we don't have a
[32:03] political system in this in this world
[32:06] in this construct that could accurately
[32:09] describe what Bitcoin gives
[32:11] us because all of these communism
[32:15] Marxism
[32:18] totalitarianism capitalism even
[32:21] capitalism it's based on the a free
[32:23] market is the idea behind capitalism is
[32:25] a free market but we know we don't live
[32:27] in a free market Market at all it's
[32:28] captured by money manipulated money we
[32:32] know we don't live in a democracy
[32:34] because you have no vote in how much
[32:37] money is stolen from you each year
[32:38] through inflation and remember it's not
[32:41] inflation from zero to 5 or
[32:43] 10% is inflation from what the natural
[32:46] rate of deflation should be and today if
[32:49] the natural rate of deflation is should
[32:51] be negative
[32:53] 5% then then if your if your inflation
[32:56] rate is 10% you're getting your pocket
[32:59] picked by 15% a year
[33:02] compounded and so so and people don't
[33:05] realize that because they're measuring
[33:06] from zero and they think oh 2% inflation
[33:09] is okay but why is 2% theft okay
[33:13] especially it's not 2% it's a lot
[33:15] greater than that because we
[33:18] already we already know the natural
[33:21] state of a free market is deflationary
[33:24] and that means every construct we have
[33:26] here and that every construct that that
[33:28] hit so home with with me with with Jeff
[33:31] um I I want to give before we talk about
[33:33] the video I I want to give one small
[33:35] netive information it was for Jeff
[33:37] really early I think it was like 4:30 or
[33:40] 5 in the morning uh and it was for me
[33:43] like
[33:44] afternoon something like that and it was
[33:47] interesting because I was
[33:49] extremely extremely nervous um I think
[33:53] on the same level nervous as I was with
[33:55] Michael sailor um I think it was a very
[33:59] similar level of of nervousness uh I've
[34:02] never been any anywhere close as nervous
[34:04] as I've been with Jeff Boo and and
[34:06] Michael sailor uh the the next one like
[34:09] once you got it like you're not as
[34:11] nervous like when once you have Michael
[34:12] sailor on if like a Larry laar or like
[34:15] someone else really big comes on your
[34:17] show it's not as as as as big all of the
[34:22] sudden because you already kind of
[34:24] leveled up your your nervousness you
[34:27] kind of like like oh yeah I did the
[34:29] Michael saor video and I'm still
[34:31] alive I'm not dead so that's a good sign
[34:35] so let's do another one and your
[34:37] nervousness goes a little bit down um
[34:40] but Jeff poof uh was really good and he
[34:43] really helped me through the video
[34:44] because I was just not a a great uh host
[34:47] and a great questionnaire there I got
[34:50] better over time and still not where I
[34:52] really want to be uh but it's it's great
[34:56] speakers like Jeff poof for like micro
[34:58] salers they really helped the host out a
[35:01] lot a lot more that uh you you you can
[35:04] see on the screen uh and it was an
[35:07] really important video for me to see
[35:11] it's possible and it's it's okay to do
[35:14] that and I can do that so yeah that that
[35:18] was an amazing thing uh and yeah what he
[35:20] said so true like inflation rate is just
[35:23] like not at zero you have to measure it
[35:26] from I would even say maybe minus 10
[35:29] minus five something like that um and
[35:33] from there even 2% inflation all of a
[35:36] sudden is like 7% inflation and that
[35:40] compounded every year that that's that's
[35:42] just too
[35:43] much uh now we have inflation rates of 5
[35:47] 10 20% depending on what metrics you're
[35:49] looking at depending also on what
[35:51] country you're looking at uh and uh it's
[35:54] it's definitely a huge huge problem
[35:57] let's see what what did uh the comment
[36:00] the comment section say that early on
[36:02] the channel um 68 year old and Bitcoin
[36:07] has changed my life I'm seeing life in a
[36:10] completely different level of the world
[36:12] myself and my descendants what an
[36:15] Incredible Gift I've listened to 100
[36:17] plus hours this one of the most oh wow
[36:21] that's an that's an that's an amazing
[36:24] thank you so much I have listened to my
[36:27] 100 plus of Bitcoin content since
[36:30] 2017 this one is the most impactful
[36:32] interview I've ever heard truly
[36:34] appreciate your works thank you so much
[36:37] man that means a lot like that's that's
[36:39] really good uh always great to hear Jeff
[36:42] and Kindergarten Cop discuss Bitcoin
[36:44] kindergarten
[36:46] Cup who's that who's who's Kindergarten
[36:49] Cop I never I think it's a movie but
[36:52] I've never did it uh excellent interview
[36:55] and amazing command of English English
[36:58] Bravo sir what a coup to get boo on the
[37:02] priz ofor yeah congrats for a great
[37:04] interview Robin yeah it has been an
[37:06] amazing interview and I I really enjoy
[37:09] what what Jeff po shared with me and as
[37:11] I said before it was fundamental in my
[37:14] understanding uh of the world my
[37:16] understanding of the podcast and my
[37:18] understanding of of Bitcoin itself now
[37:22] let's go to the next one I already
[37:24] mentioned it before it's Larry Lear lead
[37:28] I don't even know how to pronounce his
[37:29] last name I think Lear um Bitcoin now to
[37:33] 300K 10 year BDC gold rush started
[37:38] question
[37:39] mark no that's not a question
[37:42] mark but yeah exclamation Market is um
[37:46] let's he what Larry has to
[37:48] say so a lot of people fear that the
[37:52] same thing is is is happening with with
[37:54] Bitcoin I have an interesting funny
[37:56] story Maybe uh when I was in Amsterdam I
[37:59] was uh eating a Falafel the day before I
[38:01] came and I had a Bitcoin shirt on and
[38:04] the guy was asking me like hey what what
[38:05] what is this Bitcoin thing uh and he was
[38:07] saying one small sentence that I was
[38:10] like that's that's interesting that this
[38:12] the public perception of a nocoiner and
[38:14] he said like didn't black is not isn't
[38:16] blackrook now the owner of
[38:19] Bitcoin well yeah I mean it's yeah I
[38:21] mean as straty comes in I mean certainly
[38:23] look my view on the manipulation of
[38:25] Bitcoin is that it's not impossible
[38:27] possible but I also believe it isn't
[38:29] happening to a large degree I don't
[38:30] think it's likely a number of reasons
[38:31] that make it better than gold one you
[38:33] can see all the transactions on chain so
[38:35] you see the addresses too um so it's
[38:38] it's it's pretty hard to create paper
[38:39] Bitcoin I mean people have done it I
[38:41] mean Sam bankman freed did it and others
[38:43] have done it and there'll be you know
[38:44] and there are derivatives on it as long
[38:45] as there are derivatives and Futures on
[38:46] it you know that's paper and so you know
[38:49] there there is theoretically if those
[38:50] markets became enormous you if those
[38:52] markets became 100 times the size of the
[38:54] daily trading on chain well that would
[38:56] be a different matter then maybe there'd
[38:58] be manipulation taking place but and by
[39:00] the way that's what's going on in Gold I
[39:01] mean you know the amount of amount of
[39:03] gold that's traded on you know on
[39:04] exchanges on a daily basis is multiples
[39:07] huge multiples of the underlying amount
[39:09] that we mine you know in any given year
[39:11] and so um so there's it's a Tail Wag in
[39:13] the dog situation but that's not the
[39:15] case in Bitcoin and the Futures and
[39:17] options are are mild or small compared
[39:19] to the total outstanding and the total
[39:21] tradeable um you know so the other thing
[39:24] about Bitcoin is I mean gold is easier
[39:26] to manipulate in the sense that you know
[39:27] gold has never gone up 5x in a 12- Monon
[39:30] period And so you know if you're going
[39:32] to manipulate something you better be
[39:33] sure you have a printing press behind
[39:34] you so that when you get on the wrong
[39:35] side of the trade you can print the
[39:37] money to cover your margin costs right
[39:39] and that's kind of what I think they did
[39:40] in the various times when they attacked
[39:42] gold because you know they'd attack it
[39:43] and they'd probably get underwater but
[39:45] they could sit there long enough and
[39:46] just they had unlimited printing press
[39:47] and so they could suppress it um you
[39:50] know when something goes up 5x in a year
[39:52] which Bitcoin did you know in the 20
[39:54] 1920 area 20 2019 2020
[39:57] um you know that creates one hell of a
[39:59] big hole and uh and by the way you don't
[40:02] have you know you don't have a bis you
[40:03] don't have coordinated Central Bank
[40:05] actions how the central banks don't
[40:06] really even understand what Bitcoin is
[40:08] so so while I'm sure they're all sitting
[40:10] there thinking oh [ __ ] you know this is
[40:12] an alarm Bell that we don't want to have
[40:13] going off and and and it's possible
[40:15] they're even thinking how are we going
[40:16] to figure this out and how are we going
[40:17] to suppress it I wouldn't doubt me that
[40:18] they've got a working group working on
[40:20] that I think that to think they've
[40:22] actually done it and got it in place and
[40:23] are ready to go with it uh I don't I I'm
[40:26] skeptical I don't see I don't believe
[40:28] that's the case so and I don't I don't
[40:31] think they will in the future I think
[40:32] this thing is going to move too quickly
[40:33] and it's going to overwhelm them I

[42:49] and it's a great uh observation
[42:51] interesting that that part in particular
[42:53] was so popular with that video Larry is
[42:56] a great guy met him in Abu Dhabi also in
[42:59] person we we talked in in the party a
[43:02] little later and he brings out his book
[43:06] I think his book is out I don't know if
[43:08] you can buy it already but you can
[43:09] probably pre-order it already uh I think
[43:11] it's called the big print uh if I'm not
[43:14] uh completely mistaken he he's just a
[43:17] really great guy and the book is also
[43:18] really good uh and I would definitely
[43:20] encourage people to get get it and yeah
[43:23] Larry is one of the the great thinkers
[43:27] in Bitcoin especially someone that comes
[43:30] from gold is like kind of a gold buug
[43:32] and came here I also asked him actually
[43:35] what he thinks about Peter Schiff and
[43:37] let's say like that he didn't speak
[43:39] highly of him uh and but but I do agree
[43:43] uh with with with Peter shiff on like
[43:45] the let's say the the the outer part uh
[43:50] of it where the the fundamental basis of
[43:52] like what's wrong with our system but he
[43:55] just he's just wrong on the solution one
[43:58] uh and I like that Larry Lear and many
[44:01] other gold bucks uh actually understand
[44:03] Bitcoin and switch to the Bitcoin side
[44:07] uh and yeah it's it's it's great to to
[44:08] to hear from Larry he has a lot of a lot
[44:11] of uh experience and a lot of wiseness
[44:13] in in his explanations and it's just
[44:16] great to have in the in the Bitcoin
[44:17] Community uh some of the comments uh

[45:31] uh to have here we also we have some
[45:33] German comments I will not read Because
[45:36] mostly you people are English speaking
[45:39] but it's basically yeah great great
[45:40] guests and it's an amazing job you're
[45:42] doing great interview brother Larry is
[45:44] the man yeah
[45:45] amazing uh Larry is spot on Amazing yeah
[45:50] Larry is actually really good in that
[45:52] and yeah thank you so much Larry also
[45:54] for coming on uh but now we are coming
[45:57] on we have the top 10 top nine top eight
[46:00] top seven this was top six lar La part
[46:03] we coming the top five all time no not
[46:08] all time this year uh of Bitcoin I will
[46:11] probably make also like an alltime list
[46:13] more uh at some point but now we're
[46:15] coming to top five and it
[46:18] is someone that actually has two videos
[46:23] in the top 10 but I don't want to uh
[46:27] have one person two times in the top 10
[46:30] so I only uh made his main video his
[46:35] bigger video into the top 10 but Peter
[46:39] dunworth share this tab Peter dunworth
[46:42] actually has two videos on the top 10 uh
[46:45] with that uh Fred Krueger could got the
[46:49] 11th uh got the 10th Place otherwise he
[46:51] would have been number 11 just as a
[46:54] background information if you to look up
[46:57] my most popular videos on YouTube uh you
[47:00] will see p d actually two times in there
[47:03] but I only want to feature one guy one
[47:06] time uh so unfortunately Peter I I
[47:10] switched your second video with uh Fred
[47:13] Krueger so let's listen what he has to
[47:16] say about the Bitcoin price and some
[47:17] crazy
[47:20] predictions people coming out and saying
[47:22] it's go to 1 million and there people
[47:24] coming out it's go to 10 million then
[47:26] you coming out it goes to7
[47:28] billion uh so I think people that didn't
[47:32] do the research work just will call you
[47:34] crazy I guess I don't know how was your
[47:36] experience with that uh I'm really
[47:39] interested in in then um how do you did
[47:42] I call Peter Tan here crazy did did I do
[47:45] this huh I don't know you come from that
[47:49] number we now like
[47:51] 72,000 EUR maybe we will release this
[47:55] podcast in two three weeks so probably
[47:57] maybe we are already at 100,000 let's
[47:59] see uh where we are in two three weeks
[48:02] um how do we come from that number now
[48:05] to like a million to 10 million to even
[48:08] more than that to like billions because
[48:10] even from one million to one billion
[48:12] this is like a huge step in in in
[48:16] valuations how do you how do you imagine
[48:19] we are coming to those
[48:21] numbers there's there's a there's a
[48:24] really short answer to this and I can
[48:26] give you an extended one the the too
[48:28] long didn't read of this is that the
[48:31] world has a collateral problem at this
[48:33] point in time and Bitcoin is the best
[48:35] form of collateral ever invented my
[48:38] expectation is um not only is it the
[48:40] best form of collateral it is the best
[48:42] form of money ever invented and we have
[48:46] those three functions of money being
[48:47] store of value me of exchange and unit
[48:49] of account the the fact is that Bitcoin
[48:53] is the first time in history that you
[48:55] have one asset that is the the dominant
[48:58] the apex predator of all of those three
[49:00] functions of money at the same time with
[49:03] the ability to be collateral now all of
[49:06] a sudden that completely redefines the
[49:09] space as far as how much wealth can be
[49:11] absorbed by Bitcoin and this is where
[49:14] probably a better way of thinking about
[49:15] it is you know what our friend Jeff Bo
[49:17] talks about where he says it's
[49:19] impossible to Value the the future
[49:22] system from within the existing one and
[49:25] this is where what I try to do is put a
[49:28] valuation framework around Bitcoin um to
[49:31] highlight how absurd it's going to get
[49:33] very quickly and the thinking in the
[49:35] rationale um on say a $7 billion Bitcoin
[49:39] is quite simply once people understand
[49:41] what this is and we have the bulk of it
[49:44] tied up in collateral and we don't have
[49:47] the um need to sell it because we've got
[49:50] a functioning credit Market on top of
[49:53] Bitcoin then Bitcoin will facilitate
[49:57] the entire global trade because it's the
[49:59] best form of money ever invented now I
[50:02] don't think it's absolutely and be done
[50:04] with is is bang on with that one uh it's
[50:09] uh I think the 7 billion US dollar price
[50:13] Target off him it's not saying oh like
[50:16] we will reach at that point the 7
[50:18] billion it's more of like opening up
[50:20] your mind to the
[50:23] possibility that the US dollar has no
[50:26] value at all it's just Bitcoin you have
[50:29] to measure everything in Bitcoin and
[50:31] that's where I think uh he's going and
[50:34] where he tries to shift the conversation
[50:36] uh because you can shout out any price
[50:39] prediction and it will be true at some
[50:41] point 7 billion 50 billion1 trillion
[50:45] doll per bitcoin1 trillion dollar per
[50:48] Satoshi who cares because the US dollar
[50:51] is going to zero and Bitcoin is going to
[50:53] infinity and therefore everything from
[50:56] zero to um everything from like 100k to
[51:02] Infinity is a fair bitcoin price
[51:05] prediction I think base case let's see
[51:09] if the bit if the US dollar like it's
[51:11] just a matter of time like now we at
[51:15] around 100K um we dive some a little
[51:19] above some a little down uh and the the
[51:22] greater part is like it will go up
[51:25] massively
[51:28] how much to
[51:31] infinity yeah but yeah Peter D was done
[51:33] with was a a great one uh and the top
[51:38] comment was I'm sorry what did he say I
[51:40] wasn't listening I was buying more
[51:43] Bitcoin uh true I I get sometimes real
[51:47] for when I listen to that be the D with
[51:49] provides an industrial dose of
[51:52] hom for forget get to the chopper
[51:57] get to the
[51:59] Bitcoin I should say that more often get
[52:01] to the chopper F fantastic interview
[52:04] also Peter also great job explaining
[52:08] BTC Arnold is a great host and Peter is
[52:11] a great guest the Bitcoin bit the
[52:14] Bitcoin inator uh yeah I don't
[52:18] know I don't know why the Arnold
[52:21] Schwarzenegger uh comments were on this
[52:23] podcast so so popular the they like
[52:27] maybe other ones we also more popular
[52:29] then what if Peter's 7 billion Target is
[52:32] even 1% correct we are really close uh
[52:36] to a big price Target anyways uh wait
[52:39] like 10% of 7 billion is on 700 million
[52:44] so this would be like uh 70 million yeah
[52:48] that's still a big number right really
[52:51] cool perfect and thank you then uh we
[52:54] come to the next uh
[52:57] always when I say uh when I end with a
[52:59] guest I always say thank you so much for
[53:01] being on and because I say it so much I
[53:04] always want to say it at the end of
[53:06] announcing one uh which is really
[53:08] interesting now we have the next one uh
[53:13] we had now top five like 10 N8 7 six
[53:18] that was top five Peter dunworth is top
[53:21] five video now we're coming to the elite
[53:24] elite level uh uh Bitcoin here on this
[53:27] podcast and we're coming to no less than
[53:31] Max Kaiser
[53:35] himself here Max Kaiser Bitcoin will
[53:38] capture 65% of all assets and now it's
[53:43] just 0.1% of all assets and Max Kaiser
[53:48] explains uh why and and what's happening
[53:50] that's the most famous clip of this
[53:53] podcast episode with Max Kaiser the cry
[53:56] the volatility is a reason not to own
[53:58] Bitcoin haven't really thought about it
[54:00] much you know it's particularly if they
[54:03] look at the dollar and say well there's
[54:05] no volatility in the dollar I'm like
[54:09] that's true but you have a
[54:10] mathematically guaranteed decrease in
[54:13] purchasing power with the dollar so you
[54:16] know um that's part of the game of the
[54:19] dollar is that it looks stable but it's
[54:23] leeching value every second of every day
[54:26] from your hard work is being leeched
[54:28] away Bitcoin is the opposite in that you
[54:32] are gaining purchasing power for your
[54:34] hard work every single day and yes the
[54:37] price vacillates in Fiat money terms is
[54:39] an indication of the weakness of Fiat
[54:40] money it has nothing to do with the
[54:43] weakness or relative strength of Bitcoin
[54:45] one Bitcoin equals one Bitcoin just like
[54:48] one ounce of gold equals one ounce of
[54:50] gold you know gold is now hitting new
[54:51] all-time highs it's still one ounce of
[54:54] gold that the amount Supply the global
[54:57] Supply which is roughly up maybe 3% a
[55:00] year it's not dramatically changed from
[55:04] a year ago two years ago three years ago
[55:06] but the pric is up dramatically what
[55:08] what's that telling us that's telling us
[55:10] that the Fiat money world is is the
[55:12] losing
[55:13] confidence okay now if you look at
[55:16] Bitcoin versus gold well Gold's been
[55:19] around for a long time it's got a total
[55:21] market cap of roughly 13 14 trillion do
[55:23] Bitcoin to maybe one 1.2 trillion
[55:26] you know bitcoin's going to at least
[55:28] equal the market capitalization of gold
[55:31] in dollar terms so you've got now a 131
[55:33] 14x just to get to gold which is a lot
[55:37] higher than the current price and then
[55:39] of course it should exceed gold it
[55:40] should also demonetize not only gold but
[55:43] demonetize the bond market demonetize
[55:45] the property Market demonetize the stock
[55:47] market so now you're talking about
[55:50] Bitcoin worth 100 trillion 200 trillion
[55:53] 300 trillion the these are all
[55:55] completely within the realm of Highly
[55:59] probable going forward and so
[56:04] therefore um don't look at the price the
[56:08] price is the least interesting data
[56:10] point of Bitcoin it tells you just about
[56:13] nothing versus the hash
[56:16] rate or the difficulty adjustment or any
[56:19] of the other
[56:21] underlying metrics of of the protocol
[56:24] are much more telling and informative
[56:27] about what's happening than the price
[56:28] the price is just a proxy for how about
[56:32] how quickly the Fiat money world is
[56:34] disintegrating if you watch or listen to
[56:37] H we're not watching my advertisement at
[56:40] this
[56:41] point uh but yeah it's uh it's an
[56:46] amazing explanation by the way also
[56:47] think maybe that's a great possibility
[56:49] now for me to thank all the sponsors
[56:52] that
[56:54] um made this podcast possible I couldn't
[56:57] do this full time uh without paying
[57:01] more uh on top of each other um without
[57:05] my sponsors the sponsors basically make
[57:08] that possible that I can do that
[57:09] fulltime without them this podcast just
[57:12] wouldn't be here I sometimes hear
[57:15] complaints that like oh why do you do
[57:17] sponsors why do you do ads like that
[57:19] that's kind of bad bad for you and for
[57:21] your reputation you know what's bad for
[57:24] me in my image if I don't produce videos
[57:27] if I don't have the money for doing that
[57:29] that that's basically that's the basic
[57:32] math of that so um I'm so thankful uh
[57:36] for them they are not only there uh for
[57:39] making that uh podcast possible they're
[57:43] also helping out in a really big way
[57:46] many other ways I I some of them really
[57:48] have gotten to be friends I have Tony
[57:51] for example who has been on for in the
[57:53] podcast three times already Carlos from
[57:56] vigilante I I really value him a lot and
[58:00] yeah a bit bitbox it's actually the
[58:02] longest one that has been the longest
[58:04] with me now uh I have a great great
[58:07] relationship with them also uh so it it
[58:10] it really grew um into partnership not
[58:14] just like advertisement and and that's
[58:16] what I like and I like long-term
[58:18] partnership let's see where it goes long
[58:20] term uh but uh they they made this
[58:24] podcasting year
[58:27] possible so um then let's see some some
[58:31] of the uh comments sailor and now Kaiser
[58:36] the two biggest spokes people in Bitcoin
[58:38] you're killing it yeah thank you so much
[58:40] yeah I had sailor and Kaiser on on my
[58:43] podcast this was really really good Joe
[58:45] again with one of the top comments here
[58:48] Max is the OG of OG The Godfather the
[58:52] Big Daddy of everyone in my eyes his
[58:55] videos helped me a lot it's great that
[58:58] your channel has OG's like Max as well
[59:01] as new bitcoiners and the way to welcome
[59:04] everyone Robin there's always something
[59:07] new for anyone to learn from everyone
[59:10] that's basically the the thing I try to
[59:13] do with my Bitcoin Channel I try to get
[59:14] as many people on uh on as possible so
[59:17] we can learn from as many people as
[59:19] possible and as deep as possible so
[59:21] that's kind of the thing uh I I try to
[59:25] do with that yeah really cool uh thank
[59:27] you so much for all those comments let's
[59:29] come on to number three we have now the
[59:35] third most watched third Mo most popular
[59:40] podcast ever on this channel but also
[59:44] this year uh and it is Gary Kone
[59:49] adoption is way faster than you think
[59:52] Gary Kone let's see what he has to say
[59:55] in that way
[59:56] um before we come to our end routine um
[59:59] where do you see uh like Bitcoin in the
[60:02] next like 10 years what do you expect
[60:04] from Bitcoin from the community what
[60:06] they expect happening with that last
[60:09] four year cycle was amazing with like
[60:11] the first public traded company the ETFs
[60:13] happening F salvad happening uh what do
[60:17] you anything expect anything from like
[60:19] the next four eight years that uh that
[60:22] is coming
[60:24] um I think it's going to be exciting I
[60:27] mean I think we're going to see
[60:29] adoption
[60:30] uh the cool thing is I don't think
[60:32] anybody's going to have to wait four
[60:34] years uh I I would predict
[60:38] by December 31
[60:41] 2024 it's going to be extremely evident
[60:44] to
[60:45] everyone uh what the hell this whole
[60:48] Bitcoin thing's about I love it so much
[60:50] that we actually have like today is the
[60:52] 22nd of December I pre-produced that
[60:54] because I'm I'm going to Miami soon and
[60:58] going to my family in Austria soon so I
[61:01] have to pre-produce things but this will
[61:04] be published on the 31st of December
[61:07] 2024 except this date that he says and
[61:10] he's like that date will be W very
[61:13] obvious and since the recording Trump
[61:17] announced that he is promoting it uh we
[61:19] have the ETFs but I think the ETFs
[61:21] happened uh even before this video we
[61:24] had hit the 100k
[61:26] I still think that it's not it's not
[61:29] obvious to everyone uh but his his point
[61:32] stands where uh it it has been growing a
[61:35] lot and it has made an amazing uh shift
[61:38] in the in the eyes of the
[61:41] people I think you're going to see
[61:43] demand that even Satoshi didn't even
[61:46] imagine okay like it's the angles on
[61:49] this are so
[61:51] staggering um four to eight years eight
[61:55] years it'll be
[61:58] continue to hold the title as the
[62:00] greatest investment in in history after
[62:03] that I'm not so
[62:05] sure um I would I would look at this as
[62:09] a 4 to eight year hold if you're just
[62:12] looking at Bitcoin I would not come into
[62:13] Bitcoin thinking you're going to buy
[62:15] here and sell in three months the play
[62:18] here is to buy it put it away
[62:21] safely continue to buy it on a daily
[62:25] cost basis monthly cost basis okay this
[62:28] is a a very cool 401K pension retirement
[62:35] program that if you just put it away and
[62:38] let it do the work for you you then go
[62:41] out and do your day job whatever makes
[62:43] you really happy you sitting on a pile
[62:46] of Bitcoin is not your purpose and it is
[62:51] not going to make you free and it's not
[62:53] going to make you happy
[62:56] and this podcast I think was so popular
[62:58] not not necessarily because of Bitcoin
[63:01] it was popular because the freedom that
[63:03] we talked about was really good uh it
[63:06] was really good uh way talked about okay
[63:08] just holding Bitcoin just sacking as
[63:11] many satous as possible that's not the
[63:13] goal the goal should be being uh um
[63:19] being there for the community and
[63:21] stacking SS and providing value for the
[63:23] community let's see some uh inter in
[63:26] comments and yeah like Gary Kon like wow
[63:28] what what what what an amazing podcast I
[63:31] did also with him already a second time
[63:33] well the second time was already also
[63:35] really really popular and really really
[63:36] good didn't make it in the top 10 though
[63:39] uh it's great to see Gary that's now
[63:42] let's now see some top comments uh first
[63:45] one from Wilson it's great to see Gary's
[63:48] understanding of Bitcoin over the last
[63:49] few years once you see it you can't
[63:52] unsee it Gary is super authentic no

[64:59] another guest he's he's also doing
[65:01] really good yeah that was my 100th
[65:03] episode it's great that the 100 episode
[65:06] uh made it to the top 10 episodes ever
[65:09] produced uh so thankful for Gary really
[65:12] really cool uh let's move on to the
[65:15] final two the second most popular
[65:20] podcast episode ever produced is from
[65:24] and I will stample on the name but it is
[65:29] from Steven P pinut perut I don't know
[65:33] how to pronounce his name
[65:35] astrophysicist uh and he says Bitcoin
[65:38] market cap will hit 100 trillion
[65:41] us yes sir it will uh uh and now let's
[65:46] see what he has to say about Bitcoin and
[65:48] the powerlord the second video where the
[65:51] power was at least like this is the
[65:54] actual Bitcoin par video the one with uh
[65:57] Fred Krueger here the the number 10 it
[66:01] was not only about Fred par it was a
[66:03] also lot about something else but Power
[66:06] was also a topic of discussion but let's
[66:09] see what Steven has to say Michael
[66:12] sailor is not I feel like not that
[66:14] famous for making price prediction but
[66:16] he actually made one at at the Bitcoin
[66:19] Nashville like the first time that I saw
[66:21] him actually making bull bear and and
[66:24] and think case otherwise he all only
[66:27] more talked about yeah it could go to
[66:28] that trillion of market cap but he never
[66:31] really put like a time and and value to
[66:34] it and I think his base bear case was
[66:37] like three million at uh year
[66:40] 2045 and his bull case was 49 million
[66:44] which is a big bandwith also um would
[66:48] that the power also uh would that the
[66:52] power also suggest in that
[66:54] bandwith yes I I checked that his mid
[66:56] his midpoint was 13 million for
[67:00] 2045 and he didn't quite expose all the
[67:04] details of his model but his model
[67:06] basically had the growth rate coming
[67:09] down over time which is what happens
[67:11] with the power law and so it almost
[67:14] sounded as if he was using something
[67:16] that was qualitatively similar to power
[67:18] law so he had 13 million for the
[67:21] midpoint uh I would regress to 9 million
[67:25] so you know it's in the ballpark of of
[67:27] 10
[67:29] million yeah I think that's that was
[67:32] really interesting uh we looked at that
[67:35] uh we looked at that video uh and uh
[67:39] with with Stephen really went deep into
[67:41] the power law and trying to explain it
[67:44] and also trying to have use cases of
[67:47] like power law of Bitcoin on top of gold
[67:50] and instead of US Dollars and stuff like
[67:52] that it was a really good one it
[67:54] surprised me almost that it was the
[67:56] second biggest one it was like really
[67:58] popular um but uh I liked it a lot I
[68:02] learned a lot about the Pao this was
[68:04] probably the one episode where there's a
[68:06] lot of M ma math in there that I didn't
[68:11] understand that's why it surprised me
[68:12] that it was that popular because I
[68:14] thought like oh there's a lot of things
[68:15] in there that um is not as easy to grasp
[68:19] and that's why it might be harder to
[68:21] understand and that's why people might
[68:22] not like it that much uh but yeah people
[68:25] like to learn I guess um and that's the
[68:28] top comment with over 100 likes I'm
[68:32] noticing a pattern here the people who
[68:35] are most adamant about Bitcoin
[68:38] succeeding are the higher are of higher
[68:41] intelligence I 100% agree with that and
[68:44] that's a really good one uh also also
[68:47] here Robin S I would consider myself one
[68:50] of the more silent viewers that you have
[68:54] but never commented first comment thank
[68:56] you so much for commenting uh felt like
[68:59] commenting today thank you for all your
[69:01] hard work uh and delivering the
[69:03] interesting content on bitcoin the power
[69:05] is such a fascinating Discovery
[69:06] especially as it pertains to a financial
[69:10] asset really cool thank you so much uh
[69:13] that was really good uh from uh
[69:15] astrophysicist stevenh paranoid paranoid
[69:19] I don't know other saying it paranoid
[69:21] not paranoid is something different pero
[69:24] per not P not maybe uh maybe something
[69:28] like that now let's come to the number
[69:32] one and number one can only be one guy
[69:37] only one guy can be at least on this
[69:39] channel be the number one guy and
[69:43] everyone that is listening to this and
[69:46] watching this probably knows it already
[69:48] but it is Michael the freaking sailor um
[69:53] and I have some stories
[69:56] for you about him right after the video
[69:58] right when we come come to the origin of
[70:01] the podcast also um but now just let's
[70:04] listen a little bit to Michael saor and
[70:07] it's hard because like he he has such
[70:09] great answers and we could really like
[70:11] pick out like 30 minutes of that but we
[70:13] are already over one hour so uh let's
[70:16] just start listening of how he thinks uh
[70:20] Bitcoin will scale and it will start off
[70:23] with his very popular
[70:31] but that doesn't really address your
[70:32] second question which is the bigger and
[70:34] more important question how does Bitcoin
[70:37] scale and I think uh the answer to that
[70:41] question is Bitcoin
[70:44] scales in Myriad ways to say thousands
[70:49] of ways might be an understatement maybe
[70:52] tens of thousands hundreds of thousands
[70:53] millions of ways
[70:55] there are eight billion people on the
[70:57] planet and every single one of them
[70:59] encounters Bitcoin is going to think
[71:02] about how they wish to interact with
[71:05] Bitcoin and they've all got a different
[71:07] opinion the
[71:10] three-year-old that that is interested
[71:12] in Bitcoin will have a different view
[71:14] than a 15y old will have a different
[71:18] view than a 20 yearold a 30y old a 40y
[71:21] old an 85y old in China will have a
[71:24] different view than a 92y yearold person
[71:28] in Russia and they will have a different
[71:30] view than someone in the United States
[71:34] in their
[71:35] mid-60s and their views will be
[71:37] different depending upon your religion
[71:40] you know whether you know what your sect
[71:44] is what your profession is what your
[71:47] physical capabilities are and so there's
[71:51] going to be a lot of views there then
[71:53] there's 330 million companies in the
[71:56] world and you know a few of them um
[71:59] there's
[72:01] Apple when Apple encounters Bitcoin and
[72:04] they're one of the more important
[72:05] companies in the world a billion people
[72:07] rely upon them when Apple encounters
[72:09] Bitcoin I think they may look at it and
[72:11] think well wait a minute uh Bitcoin
[72:13] multi- signature Cloud what if we
[72:16] actually make the Apple watch a signing
[72:20] device and combine it with the iPhone
[72:22] and combine it with the third signing
[72:24] device on a
[72:25] laptop and then we do something with the
[72:28] cloud and apple becomes a bank that has
[72:32] hundreds of billions of dollars of
[72:34] Assets in it and we secure that via the
[72:37] Apple
[72:38] Cloud and I suppose if Apple does that
[72:41] then Google will take a different view
[72:44] well we don't want Apple to do that we
[72:45] want that to be done in
[72:47] Android and it's some point Samsung will
[72:50] say well wait a minute Samsung phones
[72:52] are used for Android and we can put the
[72:54] secure element and that and we'll take a
[72:57] different View and at some point you're
[72:59] going to have qualcom say well wait a
[73:01] minute we provide the chips that are
[73:02] used in these phones and maybe our chip
[73:06] maybe it ought to have a Bitcoin miner
[73:07] in it or maybe our chip ought to have a
[73:09] secure element to store your
[73:11] cryptographic keys so that our chip can
[73:14] be the right signing
[73:16] device and then you're gonna have all
[73:18] the Chinese companies and and the
[73:20] Chinese government will say well you
[73:21] know maybe we don't want Apple and
[73:24] Google to do this and we want our
[73:27] companies Huawei to do this and so
[73:30] you're going to have you're going to
[73:32] have governments that'll take a view
[73:34] you're gonna have companies that are
[73:36] going to take a view you're gonna have
[73:38] other companies like block and block is
[73:40] going to say well we want to be better
[73:43] than Apple or Google and so block will
[73:46] ship the bit key and block will embed
[73:50] Bitcoin support Into Cash
[73:53] app and block will do that in the United
[73:56] States but block doesn't operate in
[73:59] China and there's going to be a company
[74:01] in China and they're going to think well
[74:04] maybe we'll just copy what block does
[74:06] and we'll just do it in China and that's
[74:09] going to work for them because the
[74:10] Chinese government's probably gonna make
[74:12] it very difficult for an American
[74:15] company to do what American companies do
[74:17] in
[74:18] China so then there's going to be some
[74:21] people that going to say well I don't
[74:22] want to trust a company
[74:25] okay well you know the when you actually
[74:29] buy a cold card or you buy a treasure or
[74:32] a ledger you're trusting a company so
[74:35] what do you mean by not trust a company
[74:37] right well I'm not going to trust a
[74:39] company to store my keys well so what
[74:42] are you gonna do I'm gonna I'm gonna buy
[74:44] one of those uh steel plate titanium
[74:47] plates and I'm gonna Hammer my keys on
[74:49] the Titan plate okay well how's that
[74:51] going to get shipped to you well I'm
[74:53] going to FedEx that you're going to
[74:55] trust that company right I'm gonna put
[74:58] it in a bank safe deposit that's another
[75:00] company right there's going to be a
[75:02] whole set of people they'll take a view
[75:04] that I don't trust that company but I'll
[75:06] Trust this or I'll trust
[75:10] myself and that's going to evolve right
[75:13] I I actually think um how does Bitcoin
[75:18] scale you know what you're going to end
[75:21] up with is a a set of entities
[75:26] that uh that self- custody on the base
[75:30] layer um the ogs you know Bitcoin
[75:35] maximalist especially the L ones with
[75:37] large amounts of Bitcoin and they will
[75:39] self
[75:41] custody then you will see um a set of
[75:45] Bitcoin Banks cash app is a Bitcoin Bank
[75:49] Fidelity and coinbase will be Bitcoin
[75:52] Banks Standard Charter and custodians
[75:56] [ __ ] and
[75:58] Anchorage they will be Bitcoin Banks
[76:01] you'll probably see 10,000 20,000 50,000
[76:05] Bitcoin Banks and they will be exchanges
[76:08] custodians they'll start to offer other
[76:10] services maybe trading maybe yield maybe
[76:13] credit or maybe just maybe just uh Buy
[76:16] sell in
[76:18] custody but you'll see them and then you
[76:21] know how will the scale you you know you
[76:23] can send Bitcoin cashtag to cashtag
[76:26] right now and it's instant and free and
[76:28] you'll see a lot of that layer three
[76:30] custodial transactions going on but when
[76:34] there's 50,000 or 100,000 Bitcoin Banks
[76:39] they will want to transact highp speed
[76:42] with each other but they probably won't
[76:44] go to the base layer they'll probably go
[76:46] to a layer two maybe a lightning and so
[76:48] you'll see you'll see a lot of layer 2
[76:51] protocols lightning being the obvious
[76:53] one where people open up channels and
[76:55] you'll see a layer three to a layer
[76:57] three do high frequency final
[77:00] settlements or or settlements with a
[77:02] layer two maybe I want to do a 100,000
[77:04] transactions an hour you know in a
[77:08] channel system between 42,000
[77:10] counterparties or or 11,000 or something
[77:13] so I think you're going to see um a
[77:17] growth in layer twos a growth in layer
[77:20] 3es you're going to see layer you're to
[77:25] see um the transactions on layer one get
[77:29] bigger I mean I don't think the Bitcoin
[77:31] scales by $22
[77:35] transactions you know half the
[77:37] transaction the average transaction size
[77:39] is going to go to 2,000 then 20,000 then
[77:44] 200,000 then 2 million then 20 million
[77:47] maybe at some point you'll see you know
[77:50] the smallest transactions are you know
[77:52] million Fiat terms I mean in Bitcoin
[77:55] terms who knows but but you'll see uh
[77:58] the transactions get much larger on the
[78:00] base
[78:01] layer you see the fees will go up the
[78:05] block rewards will go
[78:07] down right the
[78:09] um there'll be an explosion in layer two
[78:13] options there'll be an explosion in
[78:15] layer three options one day you'll get
[78:18] to the point where you know if everybody
[78:21] with an iPhone can buy sell and send
[78:24] Bitcoin instantly on the
[78:27] iPhone right you might see a billion
[78:29] transactions a day on that layer three
[78:32] Network and and how will that integrate
[78:34] with Google and everything else who
[78:36] knows I think to be layer
[78:38] fours one way that um the Bitcoin is
[78:42] scaling right now is with the ETFs so
[78:45] what is an ETF you know an ETF is
[78:47] wrapped Bitcoin in a way it's like I can
[78:51] I can send you a share of IB
[78:55] and they're moving 500 million to a
[78:59] billion dollars a day in transaction
[79:01] fees so you're you're talking
[79:05] $250
[79:07] billion or $300 billion a year in
[79:13] transactions in the ibit
[79:15] network okay so if I said I got an app
[79:18] and people are going to do $300 billion
[79:19] dollar of payments on it you would think
[79:21] that's
[79:22] scaled well you know it is
[79:25] scaling you know people would say well
[79:29] some people don't like certain types of
[79:31] scaling they'll be like I you know there
[79:33] are bitcoiners that don't like the idea
[79:35] that uh that there's money flowing into
[79:39] ETFs but what I would say
[79:43] is 95% of the economic benefit from the
[79:48] arrival of the
[79:50] ETFs has gone to the bitcoiners that
[79:53] don't have ETFs the do that's an amazing
[79:57] it's it's hard to to find a a cut in
[80:00] there because he speaks in just like
[80:02] such a great manner where uh everything
[80:05] is kind of connected in a red line uh
[80:08] and you don't have that like cut off
[80:10] point where you can cut in between it's
[80:13] I don't I have no clue how we how
[80:15] someone can speak that good uh but uh I
[80:18] hope I I hope with like 50 60 70 I'm I'm
[80:21] at this his level in speaking but I a
[80:24] long way to go oh man like I'm I'm not
[80:27] even like
[80:28] 0.1% there really cool um Michael sailor
[80:32] um I can't I cannot even begin how big
[80:35] this was and I
[80:39] will maybe I will go to top comments and
[80:42] later I will talk about Michael s in a
[80:45] small story uh and we we'll explain a
[80:48] little bit more about that um love how a
[80:52] host can sail
[80:54] [Laughter]
[80:56] first top comment with almost 300 likes
[80:59] um from JF
[81:01] 9484 love how a host can ask sailor one
[81:04] question and his answer is half an hour
[81:06] long that's not a criticism I'm amazed
[81:10] at his knowledge logic passion for all
[81:12] things Bitcoin incredible man saor does
[81:16] interviews with small people as well
[81:18] even if yeah that that was crazy right
[81:22] now I have 12,400 subscribers Maybe when
[81:24] this comes out probably like 125 or 126
[81:27] something like that I don't know um and
[81:30] the interesting thing is
[81:33] Sailor agreed to come on my podcast when
[81:36] I had 2,000 subscribers 2,500 or
[81:39] something like that he came really early
[81:40] on uh saor is the biggest sailor is
[81:45] Bitcoin greatest salesman his certainty
[81:48] is what made me buy my first Bitcoin
[81:51] from Bitcoin Paul very true he's a
[81:54] really great salesperson in the best way
[81:56] shape or form um from Paul Manning
[81:59] seriously one of the best saor
[82:01] interviews I've seen he was reflecting
[82:03] on things I haven't heard him speak
[82:05] about before good questions I actually
[82:08] got that uh feedback a lot uh in that in
[82:11] that interview uh it seems like there
[82:14] was a new stuff in there for people that
[82:15] they never heard and yeah especially the
[82:18] last like 30 to 40 minutes was at least
[82:20] for me new I don't I didn't listen to
[82:22] every s interview uh but but it seems
[82:25] like it resonated with the audience a
[82:28] lot and now we have the top 10 uh and I
[82:33] have a small salor story as I already
[82:37] and I want to share that with you one
[82:39] and a half years ago you can see here me
[82:44] like myself saor and S at the Bitcoin PR
[82:48] conference back then I had a very small
[82:51] following on Twitter I was uh I had no
[82:54] podcast I didn't even publish one
[82:56] episode I had nothing at all uh in the
[83:00] Bitcoin scene the show for really but I
[83:03] was a fanboy of Sailor and I was a
[83:05] fanboy of Sion Dean and and both of them
[83:09] were standing next to each other I was
[83:10] like sprinting there The Bodyguard of
[83:13] saor looked weirdly at me because I
[83:15] think I was just walking too fast up to
[83:18] saor um and I asked like a fanboy hey
[83:21] like I really want a photo with you guys
[83:23] can I do it uh and sailor said yeah like
[83:26] come on uh let's do it and this was
[83:29] basically my first Contact ever with
[83:31] sailor and with
[83:33] cine and yeah it was it was amazing and
[83:36] I want to do that story and I I wrote it
[83:40] down at this time as I said I had no
[83:43] significant following on a I had not put
[83:46] out a single episode my YouTube was
[83:48] under 300 subscriber basically
[83:50] non-existing I had no Spotify no
[83:53] fountain no other podcasts no income
[83:56] stream that's a big one I had nothing uh
[84:00] at all coming my way in in in that way
[84:03] uh and when you look at that what what
[84:06] happened from the this photo one and a
[84:10] half years later is I had saor on my
[84:13] podcast um I debated very long if I
[84:16] should say it publicly or not I don't
[84:18] know because nobody says it publicly but
[84:20] I don't care uh I'm invited to this to
[84:23] his 100 K Bitcoin party uh in in in
[84:27] Miami that he he blanded uh I'm really
[84:29] looking forward to that one uh and that
[84:33] in one and a half years
[84:34] from um being non not known in Bitcoin
[84:39] at all to uh having the biggest people
[84:42] on in Bitcoin as you have seen uh in
[84:45] there and that's only possible with
[84:47] proof of work I don't have a father in
[84:51] Bitcoin that helped me get those
[84:53] contacts like honestly I didn't knew
[84:56] anyone when I came into here the only
[84:58] thing I did is proof of work I started
[85:00] in 2023 in the beginning of the year
[85:03] with five tweets per day as I said like
[85:06] here I had nothing I only posted five
[85:09] tweets per day since half a year up up
[85:12] to the point of this photo and I grew
[85:14] like a few thousand follows like two
[85:16] three thousand something like that
[85:17] nothing really significant on
[85:21] Twitter and this was basically the point
[85:25] where then uh I got way more serious
[85:28] about it I was like oh like I do this
[85:29] five tweets per day I put this proof of
[85:31] work in but still nobody knows me I was
[85:34] walking through Bitcoin prog and nobody
[85:36] knew me I was like I want to change that
[85:38] I want to go deep in the Bitcoin
[85:39] Community I want to exchange FS with
[85:41] everyone and that's
[85:44] where that's why I'm right now I started
[85:47] the podcast to started out of things I
[85:49] did uh go to conferences more and more
[85:52] so it's just proof of work
[85:54] if if you're not where you are right now
[85:59] um the the only thing um challenging to
[86:05] the only thing holding you back is your
[86:08] proof of work if you put in the proof of
[86:09] work you can get to almost everywhere
[86:13] like from not knowing Michael saor from
[86:15] being an insignificant person in the
[86:17] Bitcoin Community from being not known
[86:20] by anyone by walking around at Bitcoin
[86:23] par and not being recognized by anyone
[86:25] to being invited to Michael saor
[86:27] personal 100K party in Miami to his
[86:30] house I'm like oh that that was
[86:33] quick uh and uh it's like it's just
[86:37] proof of work it's nothing else uh and
[86:40] and that's what I want want to give in
[86:42] in this video also a little bit like
[86:44] showing uh not only the greatest clips
[86:47] of of of of uh my pod Bitcoin podcast
[86:51] this year but showing that if you do
[86:55] obsessed with something and put the
[86:56] proof of work in like I don't know 60
[86:58] hours 70 hours or something like that
[86:59] what I usually do in in a week not
[87:02] sustainable over the long run but right
[87:03] now I can do that uh you can get
[87:06] actually uh really really far and uh I
[87:12] I'm surprised how far actually like I'm
[87:14] surprised with all the results I I I was
[87:17] not thinking I I go go where I'm already
[87:20] now I thought like oh this will be like
[87:22] mid 2025 uh
[87:24] um I I
[87:26] over I
[87:28] underestimated uh um how welcoming the
[87:32] Bitcoin Community is especially in the
[87:33] Bitcoin Community if you want to do
[87:35] something so yeah that's just my my
[87:37] small rant about how great the Bitcoin
[87:40] Community is and how amazing and how
[87:42] grateful I am how amazing the Bitcoin
[87:45] Community welcomes someone with a proper
[87:47] proof of work so uh if you do if you're
[87:50] on your journey uh keep doing uh what
[87:52] you're doing not I want to show off uh
[87:56] some of the things the statistics that I
[87:58] got shared uh just to be transparent uh
[88:01] with everyone and and go about uh and
[88:05] showing you what what has been happening
[88:08] uh in in the background and this is I
[88:12] will start with Spotify I will share
[88:14] Spotify Twitter and YouTube and I will
[88:15] go with the same kind of route where
[88:18] Spotify is my smallest platforms also
[88:21] the platform where right now I don't
[88:23] make any money on the other platforms I
[88:25] make natively on the platform money plus
[88:27] the sponsors and this one is Spotify
[88:31] it's uh maybe you're listening to this
[88:33] on Spotify uh maybe you're listening on
[88:36] this on Fountain or any other podcast
[88:37] platform or apple um uh podcast or
[88:41] Amazon or something like
[88:42] that then you're included in that uh in
[88:47] that uh podcast 2024 wrapped for
[88:51] greatest of of Spotify let's check it
[88:55] out uh we are here we are counting up 21
[88:58] 22 24 that is the 2024 wrapped Spotify
[89:05] let's see Robin S wrapped season is here
[89:09] I love the colors here let's go fans
[89:13] were really loving your show in
[89:16] 2024 give it up for your new fans uh my
[89:21] new fans are 99 % of your listeners
[89:25] obviously because I started December
[89:28] 2023
[89:30] so probably
[89:32] 99.999% of my listeners come came in in
[89:36] 2024 uh but yeah uh super year it was my
[89:40] starting year basically and so 99% of
[89:43] all listeners discovered me also this
[89:45] year probably like very close to 100%
[89:47] actually your fans have a clear favorite
[89:51] oh favorite episode I guess yeah of of
[89:54] course your top episode was Michael
[89:57] sailor Bitcoin is economic immortality I
[90:01] love I love that sentence of his uh but
[90:06] that that's the thing like I loved it so
[90:07] much but I I didn't show it in the in
[90:10] the clip before because the data showed
[90:12] me that people actually like something
[90:14] else
[90:15] more um it was streamed
[90:18] wow it was streamed 19 99%
[90:24] plus more than your average episode
[90:28] so it was very popular uh against my
[90:32] average
[90:33] episode uh then let's go further ever
[90:36] wondered who your audience is uh yes I
[90:40] wanted that a lot uh let's break it down
[90:43] uh my listeners by age 3% are between 18
[90:47] and 24 only 3% uh 25 to 29 11% 30 to
[90:55] 34 uh
[90:57] 19% 35 to 44 is 40% it's the biggest age
[91:02] range 45 to 54 is 19% and over 55 is 8%
[91:09] and and I know I on YouTube I have 7% of
[91:14] my listeners over 65 so uh Spotify seems
[91:18] to be a little bit more skewed toward
[91:20] younger listener actually than YouTube
[91:22] which is really interesting to see
[91:25] uh let's see let's see let's see where
[91:28] in the world have you
[91:30] been oh in 2024 your show traveled the
[91:34] globe oh wow really 81 countries wow
[91:39] that's a lot just on just Spotify 81
