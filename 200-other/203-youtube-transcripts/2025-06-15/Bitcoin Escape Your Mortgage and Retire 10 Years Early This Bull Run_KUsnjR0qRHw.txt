[00:00] the UK mentality broadly is if you buy a
[00:02] house that's a great there's a lot of
[00:04] people still their pension plan is their
[00:06] property which is completely crazy the
[00:09] system now is in a place where doing the
[00:11] traditional things probably won't be
[00:13] enough to really protect your store of
[00:16] value once someone has seen what Bitcoin
[00:18] is and what Bitcoin can do there are
[00:20] probably more roots to you accessing
[00:23] more money within your current setup
[00:25] than you probably think you have someone
[00:27] who has been invested time energy and
[00:30] put Research into understanding Bitcoin
[00:32] and thinking I've got this asset I've
[00:34] got this house but I can't you know I'd
[00:36] love I'd love to be able to divest some
[00:38] of this house to buy some Bitcoin things
[00:40] like that are open to them if you want
[00:42] to be financially free and financially
[00:45] secure and stop working or reduce your
[00:48] hours at an age and at a time where it
[00:51] suits you then Bitcoin is a great way to
[00:53] to do that I
[00:54] [Music]
[00:58] think what did you do with in in
[01:00] traditional Finance yeah so I'm a
[01:02] qualified management accountant Charter
[01:04] management accountant and I've spent my
[01:07] whole career and and still continue
[01:09] actually to be employed in you know
[01:11] commercial organizations data
[01:14] analytics financial analysis all that
[01:16] kind of um traditional stuff so I've
[01:19] never been a a bank in the banking side
[01:21] or um any of those elements but I've
[01:25] always had an interest in numbers an
[01:26] interest in finance and a passion about
[01:29] person personal finance too particularly
[01:31] trying to help friends colleagues family
[01:34] members kind of find their way through
[01:36] some of the complexities of of of their
[01:39] own personal finance situations
[01:40] interesting yeah and then it's it's like
[01:42] the helping people with personal finance
[01:44] I've discovered that uh Mo most want to
[01:47] learn like oh how to pick stocks and
[01:49] stuff like that but they actually want
[01:50] to learn okay how do I preserve my my my
[01:53] wealth and they're trying to to go fence
[01:56] with it and they they're not going with
[01:58] the easy solution and finding a savings
[02:01] thing um which is super interesting uh
[02:04] what have you learned from from uh
[02:06] talking with people about their um
[02:09] financial interest and their uh their
[02:12] kind of financial um yeah strategies
[02:15] that that they are having I think a lot
[02:17] of people follow the traditional route
[02:20] go go to university come out in debt get
[02:24] a job get a mortgage try and pay off
[02:26] your mortgage get married have kids hope
[02:29] You' got enough in your pension and and
[02:32] and and for for previous generations I
[02:34] think that's that's worked well for I'm
[02:37] a lot older than you I'm kind of late
[02:39] 40s I'm probably you know I've I've
[02:42] broadly to a large part of my life I've
[02:44] followed that path and so far it's been
[02:47] working okay for me but I think for the
[02:50] generations to come I don't think that
[02:53] approach will work um
[02:56] because the the system now is in a in a
[02:59] in a place where doing the traditional
[03:02] things probably won't be enough to S to
[03:06] really protect your store of value the
[03:09] wealth that you've create to really make
[03:11] sure that that you can grow that to
[03:15] sustain a future that you're hoping to
[03:17] to achieve yeah it's interesting when we
[03:19] see that Bitcoin actually broke that uh
[03:23] traditional model of 6040 portfolios or
[03:26] like having ETFs and all all like that I
[03:29] even was on that Journey where I had
[03:32] stocks and I was like planning to go
[03:35] into real estate to
[03:36] diversify and then came Bitcoin and I
[03:38] was like okay I have to go all in I mean
[03:41] that transition took some years but uh
[03:44] so I think it continues to suck in the
[03:46] financial energy um and you said
[03:49] something really interesting uh in the
[03:51] preparation uh you said like we have to
[03:53] look at the different age brackets of of
[03:56] bitcoiners and have different approaches
[03:58] uh what do you mean M yeah I think
[04:01] there's a lot
[04:02] of um when you when you see things like
[04:07] stay humble stack SATs you know it's a
[04:10] it's a solid meme within Bitcoin space
[04:13] and you know it comes from the point of
[04:15] having a longer time Horizon don't just
[04:18] seek quick gains to buy flash cars Etc
[04:22] and I think for for for younger people
[04:25] so I'm talk you know maybe for example
[04:27] my my daughter's 17 18 as much as she's
[04:30] not really interested in Bitcoin I try
[04:33] not to push it too hard but at the
[04:35] moment she's not that interested but for
[04:37] for that kind of age group putting a
[04:40] small amount aside regularly could help
[04:43] to create generational wealth in years
[04:46] to come I think when you then get to
[04:49] someone in their maybe 30s with a you
[04:52] know starting a family they'll have so
[04:54] many other pressures on their financial
[04:58] um you know they'll have so many
[04:59] Financial demands on the money that they
[05:01] earn that it's probably harder to find
[05:05] money to to to put aside because they've
[05:07] got to pay the mortgage pay the
[05:09] electricity child care whatever it may
[05:11] be so the younger person might have less
[05:14] money available to them but if they're
[05:16] still living at home and they don't have
[05:18] the outgoings arguably they could
[05:21] potentially you know tuck away more than
[05:24] someone in their 30s you then get to
[05:26] someone in their maybe 40s 50s so
[05:28] someone like me
[05:30] and you know I I'm quite happy to share
[05:33] I've I'm in the process of selling a
[05:35] buet that I had because the interest
[05:38] rates on the mortgage are going up um
[05:40] it's the mortgage is expiring and it
[05:43] just becomes uneconomical especially
[05:45] with tax to actually own the thing and
[05:47] it's not a passive income because when
[05:49] you have a month without a tenant and
[05:51] when you you know have a boiler that
[05:54] needs replacing all of these things a
[05:56] cost that eat away at the return you
[05:57] make um and
[06:00] I think you know my My
[06:02] Generation has the opportunity to divest
[06:04] in things like if you're invested in
[06:06] bonds if youve got an Isa that's
[06:08] investing in the stock market I've got
[06:11] the potential well my generation maybe
[06:13] more so has got the potential to say I'm
[06:16] not going to stay humble in Stacks I'm
[06:18] going to make more radical changes and
[06:20] make bigger purchases um which is
[06:23] obviously something a teenager or an
[06:25] early team can't do but I think that
[06:27] solitary message of stay humble stack
[06:29] STS and just keep building up your um
[06:33] your stack I think sometimes needs a
[06:36] little bit more Nuance to it yes uh I
[06:38] mean there's so much already in there
[06:40] the the passive income side are
[06:42] sometimes get a little mad when people
[06:43] oh I have passive income like what does
[06:45] this there's no passive income you have
[06:48] to build something up and maybe it runs
[06:50] without you because you have built a
[06:52] management team around it or you build
[06:54] something around that and especially
[06:56] with real estate um I live in a fairly
[07:00] easy to manage small apartment uh and I
[07:04] have problems probably every like four
[07:06] months where I just make pictures of it
[07:09] and send it to my landlord and then he
[07:11] goes ahead and fixes it uh and and uh
[07:14] that's great because I I can make a
[07:16] picture and send it to him and he's
[07:17] responsible to fix it uh so I know it's
[07:20] it's not passive yes you can hire
[07:22] someone to do it but then you have to
[07:24] manage the one that you're hiring and
[07:26] then it's just the business that's the
[07:28] same with any business so seeing real
[07:31] estate as passive income is I think a
[07:33] foolish idea well I think the other
[07:35] thing with real estate even if you even
[07:38] if you ignore the the buy toet um
[07:40] investment side of it I think
[07:42] particularly I'm in the UK the UK
[07:45] mentality broadly is if you buy a house
[07:48] that's a great there's a lot of people
[07:50] still their pension plan is their
[07:52] property which is completely crazy
[07:54] because where are you going to live okay
[07:56] you can downsize if you're mortgage free
[07:58] and you downsize you free up some Equity
[08:01] from selling your property and buying a
[08:03] smaller property so move from a three
[08:05] four bedroom house to a two-bedroom flat
[08:07] but are you going to want to do that and
[08:10] is that you're putting all your eggs in
[08:11] a property basket whereas actually
[08:15] that's probably not the best thing for
[08:16] you to do and there are so many examples
[08:19] of where a
[08:21] neighborhood uh got bad because of
[08:23] politics because of something else and
[08:26] and then you losing so so even if you
[08:27] say oh a house is a safe investment no
[08:29] it's not you have a lot of risks that
[08:31] you just don't aware of and also um I
[08:34] think you mentioned it because of taxes
[08:36] um I seen discussions in politics a lot
[08:41] and taxes on real estate is one that
[08:44] usually comes up the quickest because
[08:47] they they cannot use they cannot move
[08:49] that property out of the country they
[08:52] can move a company out of the country
[08:54] they can move Bitcoin out of the country
[08:56] they can move other things out of the
[08:57] country but real estate is easy to tax
[09:00] because people mostly don't move out and
[09:04] and take all of the sudden their real
[09:06] estate out especially if they have built
[09:08] this running system with management team
[09:10] above it and stuff like that yeah and
[09:12] even with your own home you know there's
[09:15] there's a lot of uh
[09:17] personal um the perception that people
[09:20] have of you is tied up in property for a
[09:22] lot of people so people aspire to buy a
[09:25] bigger nicer house with a nicer car on
[09:28] the drive and and all the traditional
[09:30] Fiat mindset whereas Bitcoin I think
[09:34] does make you think less
[09:37] materialistically and with a longer time
[09:39] frame and you know if you keep buying
[09:42] and aspiring to bigger houses better
[09:45] cars that that tax element comes in
[09:48] again I mean again I don't know the tax
[09:51] setup in every country but generally in
[09:53] the UK the bigger your house is the more
[09:56] council tax you have to pay every month
[09:59] you're still getting your bin collected
[10:00] you're you're still getting police on
[10:02] the streets you're still supporting you
[10:04] know care care homes for the elderly in
[10:07] your area but you're paying twice as
[10:09] much as someone who's got a house that's
[10:10] half the size of yours so all of those
[10:13] things are still entrenched in those
[10:16] decisions you're making that and
[10:18] effectively are tying up so much of the
[10:20] money you're earning and meaning that
[10:22] you're having to seek promotions and pay
[10:25] Rises just to keep that wheel turning
[10:29] it's super interesting for me when when
[10:31] I look at accountants I have um an aunt
[10:35] that is actually accountant and and she
[10:37] was in a in a company uh just for two
[10:41] three months and I talked with her and
[10:43] she's like oh like that that company
[10:44] looks so bad in the books and he's like
[10:46] hey don't don't tell but like I I look
[10:48] at it it's so bad and then fairly enough
[10:50] half a year later the company was
[10:52] bankrupt so it's it's always interesting
[10:54] because I think accountant uh see a lot
[10:57] of um bad management see a lot of also
[11:01] personal finan depending on if the
[11:03] accountant is doing it for companies or
[11:05] for individuals and stuff like that uh
[11:08] so I'm I'm fairly certain that you
[11:09] probably have seen already some some
[11:11] Financial mistakes uh along alongside in
[11:15] your career yeah I think as well
[11:18] bringing it more to individuals rather
[11:20] than companies I think it's not always
[11:22] mistakes that people make I just think
[11:25] sometimes people don't realize the
[11:27] opportunities they've got to make better
[11:28] decisions
[11:29] so and I think I give you one example I
[11:33] I I pay interest only on my mortgage the
[11:36] reason I do that is because rather than
[11:39] paying off the loan the mortgage loan it
[11:45] allows me to put that money either into
[11:48] buying more Bitcoin or putting it into
[11:50] my pension when I get a tax benefit back
[11:53] from the government because I've
[11:55] contributed to my pension so the
[11:57] traditional mindset is
[12:00] I've got a house worth half a million
[12:02] pounds I want to pay off that £200,000
[12:04] mortgage as quickly as I can so that
[12:06] house is all mine but actually if the
[12:09] interest on that loan is
[12:11] 5% then if you can do something with the
[12:14] money that you're paying off that
[12:16] £200,000
[12:17] with that is going to earn you more than
[12:20] 5% surely well it stands to reason
[12:23] that's a better use of those funds I did
[12:26] a I did a quick I'm not going to get
[12:28] bogged down in numbers but I did a quick
[12:29] calculation if you've got a £200,000
[12:31] mortgage which in the UK is a typical
[12:35] size of the mortgage over 25 years at 5%
[12:39] interest then you're paying £1,200 a
[12:42] month of that £800 is just paying
[12:45] interest to the bank for for their
[12:48] rewarding them for clicking a number in
[12:50] their spreadsheet and transferring that
[12:52] to you um and they're earning their 800
[12:56] a month £ 4400 a month is going to
[12:58] paying off
[12:59] that £200,000 loan that you've got from
[13:02] them but imagine if you could put £400 a
[13:05] month for 25 years into Bitcoin I didn't
[13:08] even try and do a Michael sailor and do
[13:10] the calculations on it but it would be
[13:13] probably would go beyond Millions
[13:16] probably so it is a genuine choice I
[13:19] think people have but it's a hard choice
[13:22] to make because all of traditional
[13:27] mindsets and finance says you need to
[13:29] pay off your mortgage you need to pay
[13:30] off your mortgage you don't want debt um
[13:33] but yeah there are alternatives to that
[13:35] and I think
[13:37] sometimes once someone has seen what
[13:40] Bitcoin is and what Bitcoin can do there
[13:43] are probably more routes to you
[13:45] accessing more money within your current
[13:48] setup than you probably think you have
[13:49] there's an interesting uh Topic in here
[13:52] because um depth I think is within the
[13:56] Bitcoin Community um almost
[13:59] controversial I discovered um and
[14:02] there's this group that says like oh
[14:04] there's good Dept and bad de and then
[14:06] there's this group that says like oh
[14:07] like there's there's no place for depth
[14:10] in a in a Bitcoin world how do you how
[14:13] do you look at
[14:14] that I think you can be very purist and
[14:17] say in the future we don't want debt we
[14:19] just want Bitcoin I don't I I have some
[14:23] agreement with that that view however
[14:26] the reality right now is Fiat is being
[14:29] printed at a rate no one's ever seen
[14:31] it's being devalued you can borrow it
[14:34] relatively cheaply against the rate that
[14:38] we would all believe you would get as
[14:40] growth in Bitcoin over the same period
[14:42] of time so for me personally if I'm if I
[14:47] have debt against an asset like my home
[14:52] I'm completely comfortable with that I
[14:54] still believe my home will grow faster
[14:57] than the
[14:59] interest that I've got AC crewing
[15:01] against it um
[15:04] and it gives me more opportunities
[15:07] through other things I think if you're
[15:08] getting in debt to leverage up to buy
[15:12] Bitcoin and or to buy fast cars have
[15:16] holidays in the hope that I've you know
[15:18] let's say someone says I don't care I'm
[15:21] going to put 10,000 on my credit card
[15:24] for a holiday cuz I've got an amount of
[15:26] Bitcoin here and by the time I have to
[15:28] repay that in a year's time the Bitcoin
[15:30] will be paying for it for me that's
[15:32] completely the wrong mindset of what
[15:33] debt is but my view is if you can manage
[15:37] it properly um if if you've got the
[15:40] right mindset for how you're going to
[15:41] use that sensible level of debt against
[15:46] assets not against just frivolous
[15:50] spending to allow you to increase your
[15:53] holding in Bitcoin then I think that's a
[15:56] for the right person that's a that's a
[15:58] very positive thing to to do yeah also
[16:01] think so uh the I I mean we have the the
[16:04] most famous example of Michael sailor uh
[16:07] using the the feat I always call it the
[16:10] feat games uh to get more Bitcoin um
[16:14] what he does is probably not possible
[16:16] for any individual uh uh but it it opens
[16:20] up the possibility of like okay if if
[16:23] you have a mortgage on your house maybe
[16:25] uh I maybe you can even buy Bitcoin with
[16:28] that have never never got into that how
[16:31] do you look at actually um how's it
[16:34] called uh loaning against the Bitcoin
[16:37] and the borrowing against a Bitcoin yeah
[16:39] so there's well just to go back to what
[16:41] you're saying about the mortgage you
[16:44] know if let's say someone listening to
[16:46] this is in their 40s or whatever age
[16:50] they are and they're thinking well I've
[16:51] paid off my mortgage and my house is
[16:53] worth in certain number it doesn't
[16:55] matter that person could go to the bank
[16:58] and say
[16:59] I would like to borrow against my
[17:01] property they would give them a mortgage
[17:03] and you know they can say within reason
[17:06] they can say it's for house improvements
[17:08] or whatever the bank won't be too
[17:09] worried because they'll be securing
[17:12] let's make a number up they'll be
[17:13] securing 50,000 Euros against a half a
[17:16] million euro house and saying that's
[17:18] fine well you know we're not worried if
[17:20] you don't pay we'll take your house and
[17:22] we'll get our 50,000 back but that
[17:25] person could could take the view that
[17:28] I'm going to take 50,000 as a mortgage
[17:30] against my property now the the payments
[17:33] every month will be relatively low but
[17:35] it gives me an opportunity now to buy
[17:37] 50,000 euros worth of bitcoin now none
[17:40] of this is financial advice let's be
[17:42] really really clear on that this is not
[17:44] Financial advice but someone who has
[17:47] been has invested time energy and put
[17:51] Research into understanding Bitcoin and
[17:53] thinking I've got this asset I've got
[17:56] this house but I can't you know I'd love
[17:58] I'd love to be able to divest some of
[18:00] this house to buy some Bitcoin things
[18:03] like that are open to them it's just
[18:06] switching your mindset around slightly
[18:07] to think well how could I you know as
[18:11] you said sailor is great at doing that
[18:13] if you've got four chairs you only need
[18:15] one chair sell three chairs you know
[18:17] it's a bit of an extreme example but you
[18:19] know someone who has got assets if they
[18:22] believe Bitcoin is a superior form
[18:26] of uh Superior form of wealth generation
[18:30] and
[18:31] preservation then they probably got more
[18:34] options than they think to try and
[18:35] access that I brought a meme up once on
[18:37] Twitter but but I have been to to to
[18:40] Michael's house for the 100K party and
[18:42] there are more than 10 shares that I
[18:44] counted I reckon he's probably got two
[18:47] Yachts as well but that yeah
[18:49] yeah but uh but that's another a
[18:52] discussion so he's not he's not selling
[18:54] all his chairs uh but but that's an
[18:57] super interesting uh thing of like we we
[19:01] we can use that to to buy Bitcoin um how
[19:04] do you look now at the the other thing
[19:07] uh they're borrowing against against the
[19:09] Bitcoin I
[19:10] think as a basic
[19:13] principle it depends what you are going
[19:16] to use that money for if you're in your
[19:21] 60s and you're going to use it for um
[19:24] facilitating earlier retirement and
[19:26] thinking well I could sell my Bitcoin
[19:28] now because because I need some money
[19:30] but if I borrow against it and the
[19:33] Bitcoin keeps going up like I believe it
[19:36] will faster than the interest that I'm
[19:39] having to pay for the loan that I'm
[19:40] borrowing against it it makes Financial
[19:43] sense if someone in their 20s is going
[19:47] to use leverage to borrow against their
[19:50] Bitcoin to buy more Bitcoin to then
[19:52] leverage against their Bitcoin to buy
[19:53] more Bitcoin and to get greedy with
[19:56] trying to just get more coins
[19:59] it could be successful if you did that
[20:01] 12 months ago you'd be sitting on some
[20:03] nice gains now but we all know how
[20:05] volatile Bitcoin has been and is likely
[20:09] to continue to be so any kind of
[20:11] borrowing that
[20:14] has um the the ability to take those
[20:18] Bitcoin away from you is a risky
[20:21] strategy um and I I think it's for most
[20:24] people it's probably best
[20:26] avoided it's the the psychology behind
[20:29] uh holding and buying Bitcoin is really
[20:33] hard I I saw it with myself uh and I saw
[20:36] it with a lot of out bitcoiners you
[20:37] you're always trying to uh be fancy with
[20:41] it you're like okay what if I buy that
[20:43] altcoin and get more Bitcoin in a bull
[20:44] run what if I borrow against it what I
[20:47] get what if I get certain depths just
[20:49] sitting on your stack seems to be the
[20:51] hardest thing that human kinds can do I
[20:54] think it's because most people are still
[20:57] maybe partly in disbelief about just
[21:00] doing that just keeping hold of your
[21:03] Bitcoin and trying to build on the
[21:05] number of SATs that you have is the best
[21:09] approach and anything else is
[21:12] um is is quite Trad fies quiet Fiat
[21:15] mindset you know the reason we don't all
[21:18] just keep hold of our cash is because we
[21:21] know it's being defl you know it's
[21:24] becoming less valuable over time because
[21:25] of of money Printing and inflation so we
[21:28] have to
[21:29] buy stocks buy shares invest in property
[21:32] whatever you know we're going to do with
[21:33] it but Bitcoin doesn't need that Bitcoin
[21:35] just needs to sit still be left alone
[21:39] and it will do its thing over time yeah
[21:42] and it's uh it's so hard uh for there
[21:45] are a lot of bitcoiners that even then
[21:47] try a wait the DCA and try to like buy
[21:50] more when it's lower and buy higher I
[21:52] mean it can be a really good strategy uh
[21:55] but I found especially now in the last
[21:58] like one to two years it's so freeing if
[22:02] you just buy Bitcoin with the money that
[22:05] you have left over so like I'm I'm I'm
[22:08] maybe a special case because I'm 100% on
[22:10] bitcoin uh and I just buy Bitcoin with
[22:14] whatever I don't need and now also
[22:16] earning Bitcoin so I actually now have
[22:18] to sell some Bitcoin here and there uh
[22:21] and just like buy the top forever and
[22:24] buy the low forever and buy also the the
[22:26] medium things what whatever the price is
[22:28] and just just write it out and and and
[22:31] use Bitcoin basically as my my savings
[22:34] vehicle which is extremely freeing
[22:37] because now I can focus on what I want
[22:39] to do uh and uh a lot of people haven't
[22:43] discovered that yet yeah I agree and I I
[22:46] also think
[22:47] there's everyone is different and
[22:51] people's
[22:52] individual ability to handle volatility
[22:55] and risk
[22:57] and the level of adrenaline they get
[22:59] from making some of those decisions can
[23:01] influence the approach they take so
[23:03] completely agree if if people try and
[23:07] time their buyers and think right we're
[23:10] now in the depths of a bare Market I'm
[23:13] going to go on a platform like Leen
[23:14] which full disclosure I I have used in
[23:16] the past and I have benefited from
[23:18] borrowing against my Bitcoin to buy more
[23:20] Bitcoin that got me more more Bitcoin
[23:23] but you know if if you if you're
[23:25] confident we're close to the bottom of a
[23:27] bare Market then it is quite a smart
[23:29] thing to do but it does come with risk
[23:32] and I think the biggest risk is if if
[23:33] someone makes decisions like that and
[23:36] then gets
[23:37] liquidated they may turn their back on
[23:40] bitcoin altogether which is the biggest
[23:42] risk you can probably make so I think if
[23:45] if someone's sitting on a pile of money
[23:48] in their bank account and thinking I'm
[23:50] not going to dollar cost average I'm not
[23:52] going to smash by everything I'm going
[23:53] to try and be a bit clever and time the
[23:55] market the worst case is suddenly
[23:57] Bitcoin shoots up and they've got a
[23:59] choice to make they're sitting on cash
[24:01] that they could have put in but didn't
[24:03] do they just swallow their pride and buy
[24:06] at a higher price or do they stay on
[24:08] their cash again it's an individual
[24:10] thing it's up to them um some people
[24:12] just find um and it sounds like you're
[24:15] in that place now I'm pretty much in
[24:18] that place which is when I have
[24:20] available cash
[24:22] to invest I'll buy Bitcoin regardless of
[24:26] the price whether it was
[24:29] 80 90 108 doesn't really matter in the
[24:33] grand scheme of things because I'm not
[24:35] selling it anytime soon and I'm
[24:38] confident that in three five 10 years
[24:41] time whether I bought at 80 90 or 100
[24:44] will be fairly immaterial in the grand
[24:46] scheme of
[24:47] things yeah that's uh that's a good
[24:49] point of like uh if you remember back in
[24:53] 200 what is it 10 year 15 2015 and you
[24:58] look at the price range there between
[25:00] the year um how much of a difference
[25:03] does it actually make if you make the
[25:05] high of 2015 or the low of 2015 like you
[25:09] you've done well over the last 10 years
[25:11] and the same thing probably is true for
[25:13] the next 10 years well even even closer
[25:16] than that Robin even if you think to
[25:18] sort of late 2022 early 2023 you know
[25:22] there were some people waiting for was
[25:24] it 15K that never quite came and so some
[25:28] of those people are still sitting on
[25:29] their cash hoping that 15K comes you
[25:32] know it would hover between 16 17 18 20
[25:36] 0 you know but if at that time you're
[25:39] thinking no no no no I'm going to wait
[25:41] I'm going to wait for 15 and it doesn't
[25:43] come well you're now you've now missed
[25:46] out on five times growth on what you
[25:50] could have bought at 171 18 because you
[25:52] were you know arguably Being Greedy
[25:55] waiting for a bigger dip to come that
[25:57] didn't ever come and even if you had
[25:59] even if it had gone to 15 and you bought
[26:01] some you're not that much further ahead
[26:04] than if you just bought it at 17 anyway
[26:07] because the the scale of the growth is
[26:08] so much so if you think now it will be
[26:11] in let's say in five years time you
[26:13] think it will be a million do you really
[26:15] care if you spend that 500,000 EUR at
[26:20] $888,000 or $110,000 it won't it won't
[26:25] make a massive difference especially if
[26:27] the risk is you sit on your hands
[26:29] waiting for something that doesn't
[26:30] arrive and then you've missed out all
[26:32] together there are two big things with
[26:36] uh
[26:37] uh people that don't have I'm trying to
[26:41] avoid calling non- bitcoiners like no
[26:44] coiners or normous because I think uh
[26:47] they're just on the path also to
[26:49] discovering Bitcoin uh and I don't want
[26:52] to call them some something demeaning um
[26:55] but uh when we call them okay people at
[26:58] haven't discovered Bitcoin yet uh then
[27:00] we have two psychology things that goes
[27:03] on um there's like first of all the
[27:06] group that just doesn't want Bitcoin
[27:08] because of some madeup reason like or
[27:10] environment or any other uh F uh but
[27:12] then there are people that are
[27:13] interested in Bitcoin and they're saying
[27:15] no h it's too
[27:18] high uh I wait till XY Z it was 15K one
[27:24] day it was maybe even like 70k one day
[27:27] it was maybe more 5kk one day maybe it
[27:30] was $100 one day of people that like oh
[27:33] it's now $300 I'll wait till it's $100
[27:36] then it never crashed down to $100 and
[27:38] now it's at
[27:39] $100,000 uh so uh there's that side of
[27:42] things but then there's also the side of
[27:45] things once it's gets going and it's
[27:48] it's reaches New Alm High a lot of
[27:51] people uh piling I mean this this this
[27:53] meme I I
[27:55] just can can quickly show it to you uh
[27:58] that that is probably known to almost
[28:00] every
[28:01] bitcoiner and it's super interesting to
[28:04] see that Meme progressing because it's
[28:06] like oh here it was like $99,000 and
[28:09] 20,000 then then here we have like 33
[28:13] and
[28:13] 64 uh and and yeah now we we have the
[28:16] same meeme with like 80k and like
[28:19] 110k so it's it keeps progressing
[28:22] upwards uh so that's really interesting
[28:24] the psychology of uh first I'm waiting
[28:28] for it to go a little bit lower than
[28:30] they never buy if it goes lower uh and
[28:33] then once it's really out of control and
[28:37] and reaches the new alltime high all of
[28:38] a sudden everyone wants to Pile in uh so
[28:42] uh it it feels like people are really
[28:45] emotionally stupid with financial
[28:48] decisions I I think a lot of it is if if
[28:52] the people who don't currently have
[28:54] Bitcoin think I can buy it at 8
[28:58] and then sell it at 110 and I'll make a
[29:01] quick return they're effectively trying
[29:05] to use Bitcoin as a form of gambling or
[29:07] speculation which everyone has the right
[29:10] to do yeah however you may not get the
[29:14] luck you may it may never go to 80 and
[29:16] so you don't you miss out on that
[29:17] opportunity if it does go from 80 to 110
[29:20] and you sell then what are you going to
[29:21] do with that money anyway I think the
[29:23] the further you go you do your research
[29:26] you increase your conviction to buying
[29:32] Bitcoin those kind of relatively small
[29:35] movement I mean it sounds crazy to talk
[29:37] about 20,000 30,000 movements in the
[29:40] price of one Bitcoin being small
[29:41] movements but in in the history of time
[29:44] of Bitcoin those percentages are not
[29:47] uncommon so you know just I think once
[29:50] you've got your head round this isn't
[29:53] speculation this isn't gambling this
[29:54] isn't me putting some money in to make
[29:57] more Fiat
[29:58] to buy more things in my life this is an
[30:02] opportunity for me to when I have money
[30:04] available buying the best performing
[30:07] asset and the scarcest asset the world
[30:09] has ever seen and I'm fairly ambivalent
[30:12] about the price I think the only the
[30:14] only thing maybe was let let's say
[30:15] Bitcoin Rockets up to tonight and I get
[30:20] paid my salary next week I probably
[30:24] wouldn't Buy in at that level right now
[30:26] because I think that's feels quite
[30:29] inflated it's probably going to come
[30:32] back down again at some point and and I
[30:34] could I could live with that I've I've
[30:36] invested enough of what I have now that
[30:39] if it kept going up but I sat on an
[30:43] amount of money that I could have bought
[30:44] at 250 but now it's a million that's
[30:46] fine I'll you know I can still sleep at
[30:48] night but um but other than really big
[30:51] swings like that I for me it's just when
[30:54] you have the money available if you
[30:56] still got your conviction just keep keep
[30:59] plugging away keep stacking those SATs
[31:01] as the as the meme goes let's take a
[31:03] break for a moment and appreciate the
[31:06] beauty that coin vigilante has made with
[31:09] the Bitcoin watches those watches are
[31:12] the most amazing the most elegent way of
[31:15] showing that you are a true bitcoiner
[31:18] and coin vigilante just dropped a
[31:20] completely new and amazing Genesis
[31:23] edition of their watch collections you
[31:26] have the date of the first first ever
[31:28] mined Bitcoin Block in there and of
[31:31] course also the block height and which
[31:34] EPO we are currently in I love the level
[31:37] of detail they put in in this
[31:39] masterpiece make sure to check out those
[31:42] amazing coin vigilante the time pieces
[31:45] down in the descriptions I love those
[31:47] watches so so much and now if you have
[31:50] Bitcoin I really do hope that you don't
[31:53] have it on Exchange but if you do have
[31:55] it on Exchange I have two ways for you
[31:57] to deal with that the first way is you
[31:59] put it on a hardware wallet that's the
[32:01] entry for you to get into the self-
[32:04] custody game I recommend bitbox Bitcoin
[32:08] only Edition for that it's a super
[32:10] simple and secure way and if you check
[32:13] out the link in the description you even
[32:15] get 5% off if you use the code Robin and
[32:19] the second way is the Bitcoin way the
[32:21] Bitcoin way is your Allin partner in
[32:25] terms of how to get the most all of your
[32:28] sovereignty they will personalize for
[32:31] you a self custody setup that is perfect
[32:33] for your individual situation they will
[32:37] show you how you can secure your own
[32:39] devices securing your Bitcoin is not
[32:42] enough you also have to keep all your
[32:44] devices secure one topic that is
[32:46] overlooked often is the inheritance plan
[32:49] what happens with your Bitcoin once you
[32:52] are no longer here do you have a plan
[32:55] for that in place already and last but
[32:57] not least if you're in jurisdictions
[32:59] where you don't feel safe it's better to
[33:01] get a plan B for all that head over to
[33:04] the Bitcoin way.com
[33:07] robobin to get a 30 minute free call and
[33:11] just a quick side note I will be for the
[33:13] first time ever speaking at the Bitcoin
[33:16] Prague event in June it will be
[33:18] absolutely legendary and I'm really
[33:21] looking forward to seeing all of you
[33:23] there you can get your ticket in the
[33:25] link down in the description of bit coin
[33:28] PR and very important use code Robin to
[33:31] get 10% off your ticket I'm really
[33:33] looking forward seeing you there we look
[33:36] at uh and I'm curious uh how this
[33:39] affected you when you look at my life
[33:41] how Bitcoin affected my financial
[33:42] decision is basically not putting so
[33:46] much efforts on finding a new stock what
[33:48] I did before and like trying to to time
[33:51] things and like trying to almost like uh
[33:54] medium-term trading I I remember I I
[33:57] went into stocks and out of stocks
[33:59] within like six months I was never a day
[34:00] trader but like I I paid a lot attention
[34:03] to to the stock market uh and from the
[34:06] outside I was actually successful with
[34:08] it because like the whole Market was
[34:09] going up and whatever you did you you
[34:12] made money so you're not a genius by
[34:14] doing that but Bitcoin came in my life
[34:16] now full Focus I I I don't ask myself
[34:20] the question now 5 10 20 hours a week of
[34:24] like oh where do I put my money no that
[34:26] that question is clear those hours and
[34:28] know now either spend productive or on
[34:31] the family or girlfriend or whatever but
[34:33] not on the question where do I put my
[34:35] money I I probably some something
[34:37] similar happened with you I guess and
[34:40] and the bigger question that I have is
[34:42] how do you think Bitcoin if at all will
[34:46] change Financial behaviors uh if if we
[34:49] actually come to an uh Global agreement
[34:53] that Bitcoin is the savings vehicle that
[34:55] we all should uh save it
[34:58] and people then have a very great option
[35:02] uh if they want to save in and they
[35:04] don't have to invest as they're now
[35:06] forced to the
[35:07] field yeah I think on those on that
[35:10] first part of the question I I was very
[35:13] similar so I had a whole load of
[35:15] workplace pensions that I Consolidated
[35:19] into one account that I could make
[35:22] choices over into the stocks and shares
[35:25] that I wanted to buy and I being an
[35:28] accountant and loving spreadsheets I
[35:31] built a Google sheet that tracked the
[35:34] daily movements of all of those sh and I
[35:36] was my own fund manager effectively and
[35:38] was keeping an eye on all that and at
[35:40] that point in time um I was still
[35:44] dabbling with some alt coins as well um
[35:47] because my mindset at that time say four
[35:49] or five years ago was more about Bitcoin
[35:52] and crypto was more a means to an end to
[35:55] get more pounds
[35:58] um and but but it's exhausting it's
[36:01] absolutely exhausting you get your
[36:03] fingers burnt because you buy a stock
[36:05] that you think could go really well and
[36:07] it does but then it gets you know it
[36:10] gets liquidated or you know it's so hard
[36:13] to keep track on all of those things and
[36:15] I would see names that pop up in my
[36:17] spreadsheet as the biggest gainers or
[36:19] losers in the on the day i' be like why
[36:22] did I buy that one I don't I don't even
[36:23] remember what that company even does and
[36:25] yet I'm a shareholder in it you know
[36:27] it's completely ludicrous um and I
[36:32] think as I got further down the rabbit
[36:35] hole with
[36:36] Bitcoin I simplified a lot of those
[36:38] things and and firstly I divested sold
[36:43] all my non-bitcoin crypto to get more
[36:46] Bitcoin and thank goodness I did that I
[36:50] also condensed massively reduced amount
[36:52] of individual stocks I was buying and
[36:54] bought a global Equity tracker which
[36:56] just has very low fees and tracks the
[36:59] market so you know you you ride the wave
[37:02] a bit of what the market well you
[37:03] literally map the market rather than
[37:06] trying to beat it which is almost
[37:09] impossible to do and is impossible to do
[37:12] on a long-term basis because no one has
[37:15] ever done it really um and then of
[37:18] course the wonderful micro strategy is
[37:21] it was known then or strategy as it's
[37:23] known now kind of reared its head so as
[37:25] as I became more
[37:28] um orange pilled I thought well I should
[37:31] put some of my pension into strategy um
[37:37] and clearly that's been a been a good
[37:39] decision so it's although I can't access
[37:42] that until I'm 57 with the current rules
[37:45] in the UK I can access those funds when
[37:48] I'm 57 but again it helps with the
[37:50] long-term um mentality or approach that
[37:54] it's locked away I can't I I can trade
[37:56] it if want to but I can't access that
[38:00] money but being in strategy means that
[38:03] I've got at least um exposure to Bitcoin
[38:05] in my pension that otherwise I I
[38:08] couldn't have unfortunately in the UK
[38:10] you can't have ETFs at all um the second
[38:15] question about whether people when when
[38:18] Bitcoin is identified as a as the best
[38:22] savings vehicle I think it is it is now
[38:25] by people that understand it the the
[38:27] trouble is there are too many people
[38:29] still um believe some of the fud or
[38:33] aren't prepared to put in the work to
[38:35] really understand what Bitcoin is and
[38:37] the benefit it could give them even as a
[38:39] small amount of their um portfolio so
[38:44] you know I'll often have conversations
[38:45] with people who say yeah but I'm too
[38:47] late or I'm you know I'm I'm not sure
[38:50] I'm risk of you know I'm a bit risk
[38:52] averse I don't and two things I'll say
[38:54] to that to people is if you contribute
[38:56] to a pension every month or you're
[38:59] looking to buy a house you're buying at
[39:01] the top of the market there your your
[39:03] pension contribution every month is
[39:05] buying shares in apple Nvidia Etc that
[39:09] are probably at or close to their
[39:10] all-time high if you're buying a new a
[39:13] house it's probably the highest that
[39:15] house has ever been in value so the only
[39:18] reason you wouldn't want to buy at an
[39:19] all-time high of of an asset is if you
[39:22] think it's going to crash to zero but if
[39:24] you understand Bitcoin and and see the
[39:26] history
[39:27] then don't worry that you're buying at
[39:29] alltime high if we if we are there
[39:32] because if you plan to hold it for 5 10
[39:35] 15 years you're it's not a problem
[39:38] alltime high now is going to be a blip
[39:41] at the bottom left of the chart in 5 10
[39:44] years time um I think the biggest
[39:46] challenge we've got is just trying to in
[39:49] a non-evangelical way try and just
[39:54] encourage people to do their own
[39:56] research the biggest problem I have is
[39:59] I'm I'm too passionate I'm too
[40:01] Evangelical and often it it scares
[40:03] people off or I historically I've not
[40:06] always gone about it in the right way
[40:07] but I'm I'm learning and I'm trying to
[40:09] change my Approach orange billing is
[40:12] hard you you you discover this thing uh
[40:14] you're so con uh convinced of it uh and
[40:18] you're so passionate about it and then
[40:19] you meet someone that is at zero like
[40:22] you had 100% conviction they are like oh
[40:26] like what is bitcoin I'm at zero uh and
[40:29] uh get and it's and you're trying to get
[40:32] him in with like one conversation to
[40:34] like 80 or
[40:36] 90% uh but it's probably way better to
[40:38] get him in the first conversation just
[40:40] like one two% and when you meet him a
[40:43] next I'm like let's get him up to 4% uh
[40:46] and and uh I even like um I don't know
[40:50] if it's a good strategy but I do it uh
[40:53] when when I meet friends and they
[40:54] haven't been in in Bitcoin uh and they
[40:57] just uh say uh stuff that is just not
[41:01] true on on bitcoin or they're like uh
[41:04] having some interesting weird opinion on
[41:06] bitcoin I I try to decide if I even want
[41:09] to tackle that if you want to uh if you
[41:12] want to tackle All the Small Things that
[41:14] they have around Bitcoin that are wrong
[41:16] uh it's a long conversation probably
[41:18] takes a week yeah um so I'm trying to
[41:21] focus on like what's the big thing that
[41:24] uh we we could talk about and and and
[41:26] could get seem like from 2%
[41:28] understanding to 3% understanding uh
[41:31] which we can then build on uh the next
[41:33] time and super interesting what happens
[41:35] is uh sometimes you you get them from 2%
[41:39] to 4% and then they do 20% themselves
[41:43] because all of the sudden they got
[41:44] interested in it uh so I think that's uh
[41:46] that's at least what what my uh small
[41:49] learnings from like I don't know 20 to
[41:52] 50 orange pills in in real life uh where
[41:55] yeah yeah and I think every everyone
[41:58] moves at their own pace and certain
[42:01] aspects of Bitcoin education land better
[42:05] with some people than others so for some
[42:07] it might be the money printing suddenly
[42:08] becomes hang on a minute this wow all
[42:11] this money printing is going on that's
[42:13] killing the value of cash that's you
[42:16] know and that that that one thing could
[42:18] then quickly trig to use your example
[42:20] move them from 4% to 20% you know for
[42:23] others it might be the decentralization
[42:25] effect you know someone tried to go and
[42:28] take £22,000 out of their bank account
[42:30] and they're being asked what they want
[42:32] to do with that money and they're saying
[42:33] well hang on it's my money why are you
[42:35] asking me what I want to do with it it's
[42:36] n of your business and sort of thinking
[42:38] oh and I remember Robin said it's
[42:39] decentralized and you can send it
[42:41] without needing permission so wow
[42:43] Bitcoin fixes this so for them it could
[42:45] be that aspect I think as bitcoiners we
[42:50] have to kind of take people on the
[42:52] journey at the pace that suits them and
[42:54] but it's it's hard because everything in
[42:56] me wants to protect the people I like
[42:58] and the people I love and I I don't like
[43:02] to see them making um let's let's not
[43:06] say Financial mistakes let's say
[43:08] suboptimal financial decisions right and
[43:10] it's easier to talk to people about ways
[43:13] they might be able to save on tax or get
[43:16] a better return on their savings or save
[43:19] money on their I don't don't know car
[43:22] insurance or whatever it may be that are
[43:23] kind of practical day-to-day Financial
[43:25] things but if you start to say you can
[43:29] put a large amount of your current net
[43:32] worth into this magic internet money
[43:35] thing it just it blows people's
[43:39] minds like why should like it's too
[43:42] risky yeah yeah yeah yeah it's it's also
[43:45] interesting um you mentioned Pension
[43:47] funds um uh it's it's it's it's hard for
[43:52] me to not see them as a as a permit
[43:55] scheme as a SCH as a game overall with
[43:58] like locking periods and and like the
[44:01] the contributions and stuff like that
[44:03] how do you look at them I think it's
[44:06] like we discussed earlier it depends on
[44:09] your age and how how far you are into uh
[44:14] having a pension already you know
[44:17] if I've got to the point I got to the
[44:20] point in my mid 4S where a reasonable
[44:23] amount of my net worth was tied up in a
[44:26] pension so so I have no choice I can't
[44:29] get at that money I can't turn back the
[44:31] clock and put it somewhere else you know
[44:33] so at that point the credible option
[44:36] you've got is how do I get exposure to
[44:39] Bitcoin in that
[44:41] pension if I was talking to a 20year old
[44:45] right now I think there's still value in
[44:48] it as long as you're in a workplace
[44:50] scheme where your the company you work
[44:53] for
[44:54] contributes a good amount because the
[44:57] other thing you can't underestimate is
[44:59] the tax benefit so even if you believe
[45:03] um that the they'll become more tax
[45:06] heavy over time and you know there's
[45:09] also maybe a risk that governments might
[45:11] apply wealth tax to pensions or you know
[45:14] worst case take them away from you Al
[45:17] together I mean that's a bit conspiracy
[45:19] theory but you know it's not self-
[45:21] sovereign you are relying on the rules
[45:24] that are in place to still be in place
[45:26] when you retire
[45:27] but because of the real the massive if
[45:29] you're a 40% taxpayer which in the UK
[45:32] you are if you earn over about
[45:35] 50,000 then the amount that you save by
[45:39] contributing to a pension because
[45:41] effectively it goes in as your gross
[45:44] salary you you're you don't get taxed at
[45:47] all on that the amount that you put into
[45:49] your pension um and if you then invest
[45:53] that in micro strategy you're
[45:54] effectively getting strategy shares at a
[45:57] 40% discount than if you just bought
[45:59] them in a generally in a in a general
[46:03] investment account so still for me it's
[46:07] worthwhile to have an element of that
[46:10] because of the tax benefits I get on the
[46:13] money going in right now I'm effectively
[46:16] getting more micro strategy from my
[46:18] money um and you know because I'm saving
[46:21] the tax if I just get paid a salary and
[46:24] buy Spot Bitcoin I don't see that tax
[46:26] benefit but I think it is a a decision
[46:29] an individual has to make because
[46:32] clearly spot Bitcoin in Cold Storage
[46:36] that's the that's the purest way to be
[46:39] self- Sovereign and have control over
[46:41] your own destiny and your own finances
[46:43] but whilst these things are still being
[46:46] dangled in front of us and there are
[46:48] still opportunities or if if people are
[46:51] already committed to a large pension
[46:54] then the question becomes are you
[46:56] invested in the thing really want to be
[46:57] invested in or should you be selling
[46:59] some of those shares to consider
[47:02] companies like strategy or if you're in
[47:05] um America you know your your pension
[47:07] fund you can put it all into a to ibit
[47:10] Black Rock you know um Bitcoin ETF and
[47:14] okay you got fees associated with that
[47:16] but it's probably still going to
[47:17] outperform any other general fund that
[47:20] you might invest in and the the few of
[47:24] it also depends on on your age is is
[47:26] good
[47:27] uh because if you are now um I don't
[47:31] know like five or 10 years away from
[47:33] getting something from your retirement
[47:34] or Pension funds uh it probably doesn't
[47:37] make sense to opt out of that but it's a
[47:39] different question of if you are like a
[47:40] 20y old and you are now trying to decide
[47:43] if you're even opting in in those things
[47:46] and then having Bitcoin as an option
[47:48] it's a whole different set of uh this
[47:51] decision that that you can make uh and
[47:54] uh it's it's an it it's super
[47:57] interesting for me also how the current
[48:00] generation and I'm like I'm wondering if
[48:04] this is is a general theme around the
[48:06] world or is it just Austria probably not
[48:09] um where people are saying oh like I
[48:12] don't think I will get a pension so uh
[48:14] the the current generation it's it's
[48:16] even the non- bitcoiners they think like
[48:18] I'm very doubtful that I get anything
[48:22] from my pension at all uh and I'm well
[48:25] aware of that and I'm trying to plan for
[48:27] that they sometimes don't plan with
[48:29] Bitcoin uh but um I I rarely meet
[48:33] someone like oh of course I will get my
[48:34] pension in like six years time so we we
[48:37] all really kind of accepted that I think
[48:40] it's worth um distinguishing between the
[48:43] two though so there's a a personal
[48:45] pension is a pension that you've
[48:48] contributed to individually that that
[48:50] has your name attached to it aate
[48:52] pension we call it in the UK I don't
[48:54] know if that's a that's the term that
[48:56] would be used in Austria or elsewhere
[48:57] but effectively the the the the
[49:01] government paying you an amount of money
[49:04] when you retire at you know for at my
[49:07] age I can't get that until I'm 67 so I'm
[49:11] almost 20 years away from getting the
[49:13] state
[49:14] pension my view is by the time that
[49:17] comes around it will either be means
[49:20] tested or it will be a fraction of what
[49:23] it is now and you know I I there is zero
[49:27] part of me that is relying on that for
[49:29] any element at all of my retirement and
[49:32] I I would say the same to anyone
[49:34] particularly again the younger younger
[49:36] people so do not put any um hope into
[49:42] the government helping you retire at at
[49:45] an old age
[49:47] because the system just can't afford it
[49:50] in the current state that it's in um and
[49:52] the numbers aren't very big anyway you
[49:53] know so you if you want to be
[49:56] financially free and financially secure
[50:00] and stop working or reduce your hours at
[50:03] an age and at a time where it suits you
[50:06] then Bitcoin is a great way to to to do
[50:10] that I think I think so too yeah
[50:12] absolutely um one last topic that I want
[50:15] to touch on is the Bitcoin and how it
[50:18] changes lives um how did it your how did
[50:23] it influence or change uh your life um
[50:27] it made me much less materialistic
[50:29] actually I and and maybe it coincided
[50:32] with getting a bit older anyway and and
[50:34] you know kids growing up and things but
[50:36] you know I I I used to
[50:39] care about what people thought about me
[50:42] in in the sense of I wanted a nice car
[50:46] um designer clothes all that kind of
[50:48] thing to to project that I have been a
[50:50] success I am a successful person
[50:53] honestly I couldn't care less now I you
[50:57] know I'm I'm not I don't really care
[50:59] what people think about me in that in
[51:01] that sense not
[51:02] materialistically um you know much care
[51:05] much rather care what people think about
[51:06] me as a as a human being and you know
[51:10] what I contribute to my friends and
[51:12] family rather than you know hasn't he
[51:16] been successful because he's got a a
[51:17] nice a nice car um I had quite a long
[51:22] bout of long covid in um sort of the
[51:25] early early 20
[51:27] 22 and I think that that also was a
[51:29] trigger that really made me re-evaluate
[51:32] what was important in my life and that I
[51:35] was on this earning treadmill which was
[51:38] keep trying to get a promotion keep
[51:40] trying to earn more money and and you
[51:42] know just keep doing all those tradire
[51:45] things that we spoke about earlier and I
[51:47] think having that bout of quite severe
[51:49] illness and if I'm
[51:51] honest pretty much a mental breakdown
[51:54] just made me completely re ESS my life
[51:57] my Outlook and my future and think so
[52:00] much of what I thought mattered really
[52:02] doesn't and health and happiness and all
[52:07] of the things that come with health and
[52:08] happiness mean so much more than
[52:11] material things and makes a lot of sense
[52:13] and I see actually a lot of people a lot
[52:15] of bitcoiners uh going through a similar
[52:19] Journey um and it's always hard to to uh
[52:23] to see like how much of that influence
[52:26] was was Bitcoin and how much of the
[52:27] influence was was just the
[52:30] world around you it's also a question
[52:33] that I struggle a lot with because I'm
[52:34] in in Bitcoin five years from 21 to
[52:37] 26 21 to 26 is a quite transformative
[52:41] time in any human's life so it's hard to
[52:44] say like okay what did be come because
[52:48] uh of um of of an environment change of
[52:52] work of girlfriend of Bitcoin of like
[52:55] what is the what the influence in Factor
[52:57] on your own personality for that it's
[53:00] it's almost impossible to say but I do
[53:02] think Bitcoin uh puts puts the right
[53:05] incentives and the interesting framework
[53:07] around your life uh to to make things
[53:10] easier not easier but for lack of a
[53:14] better word it's I say easier maybe more
[53:17] um guided in a better Direction maybe
[53:20] also really cool um we have one question
[53:23] that I ask each and every one of my
[53:24] guests and the question is what can we
[53:26] learn from you besides Bitcoin
[53:30] kombucha do you do you know what
[53:32] kombucha is I if I had to guess it's is
[53:36] it that game that you throw a small ball
[53:39] and then like big balls after it no it
[53:41] might be called something else actually
[53:43] in it probably isn't it's a fermented
[53:45] tea drink uh
[53:47] kombucha um I you're you're busy typing
[53:51] it in now to see if you can see what it
[53:52] is it's um I I stumbled across it when I
[53:56] had long covid um as kind of more
[53:59] holistic ways to try and um recover
[54:03] there there you go um and one of the
[54:07] approaches to
[54:09] improving um long covid is improving is
[54:12] the link between gut health and overall
[54:16] mental and physical health and
[54:18] well-being one of the things that is
[54:20] meant to be really positive for you know
[54:22] maintaining strong gut health is
[54:24] fermented food so things like kombucha
[54:28] cafir
[54:29] sauerkraut um
[54:33] kimchi the one that really resonated
[54:35] with me was kombucha I started making my
[54:37] own um and I love the process the
[54:41] complexity of the process of
[54:43] experimenting with different tees and
[54:45] different methods I loveed the flavor of
[54:48] the kombucha and I loved how it made me
[54:50] feel and it I did honestly think it was
[54:53] a large part in my recovery from long Co
[54:56] both I think physically restoring my gut
[54:59] health as well as the mental focus that
[55:02] that gave me at the time um and because
[55:05] I'd been so unwell I'd left the previous
[55:07] job that I was in because I just
[55:09] couldn't do that job anymore I had no
[55:11] energy to my my work life my home life
[55:15] and my mental and physical health were
[55:18] all just really suffering so the only
[55:20] one I really could been was work to
[55:23] focus on on the rest and an
[55:26] entrepreneurial friend of mine said
[55:28] start up your own business just start
[55:30] making and selling kombucha so I did and
[55:35] I now as a little hobby side hustle I I
[55:38] brew and sell locally to friends family
[55:42] friends of friends people that have
[55:43] stumbled across my website or heard
[55:45] about me and it's it's fantastic because
[55:48] other people that have been in similar
[55:50] positions with brain fog and some of the
[55:53] other side effects associated with long
[55:55] covid of um or chronic fatigue syndrome
[55:58] whatever you want to call it um have
[56:00] found that it's really helped them so um
[56:03] everyone should Brew their own kombucha
[56:05] it's h it's a fantastic thing to do it
[56:07] tastes great and it's really good for
[56:08] you is it difficult to to do that no no
[56:12] you can you can buy a starter kit you
[56:14] can either get a starter kit from
[56:16] someone if you can find someone locally
[56:18] that does it themselves it's a bit like
[56:20] you have the process of doing sourdough
[56:23] bread where you have a a starter and you
[56:25] keep that starter going effectively once
[56:27] you've brewed your kombucha a proportion
[56:30] of the kombucha that is that final Brew
[56:33] goes in to start the next brew and you
[56:35] just top it out with sweetened tea you
[56:37] know cooled down sweetened tea is all
[56:40] that goes into it and the bacteria and
[56:41] the probiotics convert the caffeine and
[56:44] the sugar into more healthy probiotics
[56:46] and bacteria and it's a slightly acidic
[56:49] slightly vinegary tart taste with
[56:51] elements of sweetness and it doesn't
[56:53] taste like tea at all it's um yeah it's
[56:56] it's amazing I love it really cool I
[56:58] have to I have to try that out somehow
[57:00] um perfect then thank you so much uh we
[57:02] have an ENT as you know in the podcast
[57:05] where the previous guest is asking a
[57:06] question for the next guest without
[57:08] knowing who the next guest actually is
[57:10] as always it's an interesting one uh if
[57:12] you could ask satosi one question which
[57:15] one would it be oh man that's a horrible
[57:18] question um and I as you said that
[57:22] question out all I can hear in my mind
[57:24] are thousands and millions I of more
[57:27] educated and informed bitcoiners than me
[57:30] saying why did he say that why did he
[57:32] say that um I think I would
[57:35] say where would you want Bitcoin to be
[57:39] in 20 years time or 30 you know where
[57:43] where do you see the future of this
[57:44] going and how how fast would you like it
[57:47] to get there um because
[57:50] clearly all of the aspects of what make
[57:53] good money Bitcoin ticks all of those
[57:55] boxes we don't it's been covered to
[57:57] death we don't need to touch on it here
[57:58] obviously but I wonder to what extent
[58:02] Satoshi had a vision for how other
[58:06] elements of of life and you know would
[58:10] would change and evolve over time um and
[58:13] whether he how Visionary he was or
[58:16] whether he was just a purist of this is
[58:17] what good money is and all good things
[58:19] can flow from that but didn't give it
[58:21] too much thought that's a really good
[58:23] one I I like it it's it's it's super
[58:26] interesting to think about
[58:29] um what questions you would ask Satoshi
[58:33] like if you're like having satosi as a
[58:36] podcast guest like what are the the the
[58:38] directions you want to go with that
[58:40] conversation what questions you want to
[58:42] ask him uh and I actually thought about
[58:45] that a lot uh but it's so hard uh
[58:49] because you can go down like 20,000
[58:53] different Avenues with with that
[58:54] conversation uh and it would be uh so
[58:58] interesting to know even if he's a
[59:01] really bad speaker I think it would be
[59:04] so interesting to listen to it and see
[59:07] what what what he actually F when he
[59:09] made Bitcoin and uh how he looks now
[59:13] back at at the Bitcoin time and through
[59:16] different developments like asking about
[59:18] the block size war and in different
[59:20] interesting Avenues where we just go for
[59:24] uh which is we went in Bitcoin and where
[59:28] there are Forks in the road of of the
[59:30] Bitcoin
[59:31] development oh man the I wonder if he I
[59:35] wonder if I wonder if Satoshi would look
[59:37] at where we are now and think we're
[59:40] ahead of where he hopes we'd be by 2025
[59:43] or whether we're slightly behind where
[59:44] he hoped we' be I don't again it's
[59:47] interesting to to think about that
[59:49] because on one hand so much has happened
[59:51] even in the last 6 nine months with
[59:54] strategic Bitcoin reserve and everything
[59:56] going on in America but you know maybe
[59:58] when he maybe 16 years ago he thought we
[60:01] might be in this point 5 years ago and
[60:04] why is it taking so long um yeah it's
[60:07] fascinating it's good very good question
[60:10] so Dori comes back and says like oh what
[60:12] the heck are we doing we not at a
[60:13] Bitcoin standard yet yeah yeah why why
[60:17] we got why have we got so many podcasts
