[00:00] avoiding Bitcoin to be unsp any utxo
[00:02] that's smaller than you know a couple
[00:04] hundred, sets will just become unsp the
[00:06] more valuable Bitcoin gets the more
[00:08] users it attracts the higher net worth
[00:10] users it attracts the higher fees
[00:12] they're willing to pay the more hash
[00:14] rate comes online to secure the network
[00:16] the more valuable Bitcoin becomes and it
[00:18] just goes over and over and over like
[00:20] these Cycles until it literally sucks in
[00:22] everybody at a certain point you reach a
[00:24] full saturation and that might be around
[00:26] like 10 million users and that current
[00:28] user who's like at the kind of the lower
[00:30] end of the wealth spectrum they get
[00:31] pressed up and they no longer can use
[00:33] the base
[00:34] layer not enough bitcoiners know what
[00:37] Utes o are actually uh and how to
[00:40] properly manage them what are the risks
[00:43] involved with that and why should we
[00:45] care about you Tak s so um let's start
[00:49] with like a combination of question um
[00:53] like what are those and why should we
[00:55] care about them sure yeah so utxos they
[01:00] stand for
[01:01] unspent transaction
[01:04] outputs okay and the way that Bitcoin
[01:07] works is it it it's it's an accounting
[01:11] system that basically
[01:13] uses these uh utxl and gxls are like
[01:18] chunks of C coin that's kind of how I
[01:20] always explain them I think it's easiest
[01:22] to think of them just as you know as as
[01:25] they're on chunks um so similar to how
[01:29] gold comes in chunks chunks right it
[01:31] might come in a big bar or a small chunk
[01:34] or a little tiny flake um and those you
[01:38] know those chunks are measured in terms
[01:40] of you know grams of gold or atoms of
[01:43] gold you can think of well Bitcoin comes
[01:46] in these utxos which are just junks of
[01:49] Satoshi right and so every utxo has a
[01:52] value that has that has a Satoshi amount
[01:56] and whenever you're spending Bitcoin
[01:58] whether you know it or not
[02:00] you're really spending these
[02:03] utxos okay
[02:05] um when you're when you're transacting
[02:08] with Bitcoin you have to spend the utxo
[02:11] entirely so um you know even if you're
[02:15] you know let's say you're you're sending
[02:19] uh a million sets to somebody else right
[02:23] and the only sized utxos you have are um
[02:27] a bunch of 100,000 Satoshi utx O then
[02:31] you'll have to spend you know 10 of them
[02:34] together in order to get that million
[02:36] amount right likewise if all you have is
[02:40] 10 million satin
[02:42] utxos then You' have to spend a 10
[02:45] million set utxo in its entirety to you
[02:49] know basically split it into like a
[02:51] little million slat one which you'd send
[02:52] to the person and then you would get a 9
[02:55] million set utxo back to
[02:57] yourself so the system works in a way
[03:00] where you're always you know you're
[03:01] spending these these utxl in their
[03:04] entirety whenever you transact and then
[03:06] you're always creating brand new ones on
[03:09] on the out on on the output side of
[03:11] things
[03:12] right that's kind of the overview of
[03:14] what utxos are how Bitcoin as a system
[03:17] works in terms of
[03:19] utxos um and you know I guess you know
[03:22] we can kind of dig into why it's
[03:24] important to manage them now if you want
[03:27] yeah definitely I think there are two
[03:29] main aspects to it like why we should uh
[03:32] um manage them like there's one avoiding
[03:35] to be avoiding Bitcoin to be unpend and
[03:38] the second is like privacy let start
[03:40] with the Bitcoin unsp part of it because
[03:44] I think this is the the part that scares
[03:46] Bitcoin at the
[03:47] more yeah
[03:49] definitely okay so yeah um so in Bitcoin
[03:54] there's this term called dust right
[03:57] sometimes we we we call thing we call
[03:59] like these really small utxos dust we
[04:03] call them that
[04:04] because um they that they're so small
[04:09] that they can't even be spent
[04:12] without spending a fee that's worth more
[04:14] than the utxo itself okay so let me give
[04:18] you some context here in terms of how
[04:20] this actually
[04:22] works another thing that you have to
[04:24] understand when you're spending
[04:26] Bitcoin is um what you're paying for for
[04:30] in terms of your transaction fees is
[04:32] you're paying for the amount of data
[04:35] that you need to um put into a Bitcoin
[04:38] block right and so the more data you
[04:42] need the higher the transaction fee is
[04:44] going to be now luckily for Bitcoin the
[04:49] amount of data that's required for
[04:51] spending a
[04:53] utxo is for all intents and purposes you
[04:56] know the same um
[05:00] across all values of utxos so for me to
[05:04] spend a 1 million set utxo costs the
[05:08] same amount as for you know some whale
[05:11] to spend a th000 Bitcoin utxo right so
[05:17] this is where the analogy with gold kind
[05:19] of breaks down right with gold a larger
[05:22] amount of gold costs way more to spend
[05:24] right way more to to ship uh overseas or
[05:28] to guard or you know that type of thing
[05:30] right with
[05:31] Bitcoin um it costs the same amount for
[05:34] a large amount and for a small amount
[05:36] right as long as you're kind of dealing
[05:37] with the same amount of
[05:39] utxos so that's kind of the context here
[05:42] is that like you're when you're
[05:43] transacting with Bitcoin you're paying
[05:45] for the data and the amount of data
[05:47] that's required to spend a utxo is is
[05:50] consistent across all sizes of utxos
[05:54] okay so currently um here let's take a
[05:58] look at the M Pool I'm going go ahead
[06:00] and share my screen all right can you
[06:02] see I see it perfectly thank you all
[06:05] right so this is a great website um I
[06:08] think most bitcoiners are familiar with
[06:11] it but if you're not um you know I would
[06:14] definitely consider going to this
[06:16] website and and kind of clicking through
[06:18] it and seeing um what the different
[06:20] things are in here there's a lot of
[06:23] information but what this website is
[06:25] mempo dospace and its primary function
[06:28] is to show you the Bitcoin blockchain
[06:32] okay so over here you have all the
[06:34] blocks that have already been confirmed
[06:37] and if you click on any of these blocks
[06:39] you can see you know some of the
[06:41] information of the block um the
[06:43] transactions that got included inside of
[06:45] it and whatnot right what I like using
[06:48] this website for
[06:49] primarily is to see the fee rates that
[06:53] people are paying right to to get into
[06:56] the next block so you can see here the
[06:58] range and
[07:00] right um between 16 Satoshi per VTE and
[07:05] 355 Satoshi per VTE that's the range of
[07:08] fees that people are paying to get into
[07:10] the next block um and then you know the
[07:13] ones after that are are all in kind of
[07:15] that 15 Satoshi per V band so this is a
[07:19] um this is basically the fee rate that
[07:22] you multiply by the amount of data that
[07:24] your transaction requires okay so um um
[07:30] right now uh I believe
[07:34] a a typical transaction um takes up
[07:38] about
[07:39] 150 virtual
[07:41] bytes okay so if you were to multiply
[07:46] this lower this lower bound the 16 right
[07:49] times
[07:51] 150 uh what would that give you 800 is
[07:56] that what it is no probably more than
[07:57] that I'm getting the softare one sec let
[07:59] me just do this before I make fool of
[08:01] myself
[08:02] 2,400 so 2,400 Satoshi is how much it
[08:06] would cost in fees to just make a single
[08:09] transaction okay so that that's kind of
[08:12] like the the minimum amount of Satoshi
[08:14] you would need in a utl currently in
[08:17] order to just spend it right if you had
[08:19] anything less than that then that would
[08:20] be dust um so it doesn't sound like
[08:23] that's you know too bad of an issue
[08:26] right it's like oh that's not bad 2,400
[08:28] SATs you know
[08:30] most of your utxos are are far larger
[08:32] than that most likely hopefully but what
[08:35] what happens in the future when this
[08:38] becomes a problem is when the fee rates
[08:41] get higher and they stay higher right
[08:44] and the reason why this would happen is
[08:46] you could have you know another wave of
[08:49] adoption maybe you have more
[08:51] institutions more High n orth
[08:53] individuals more
[08:55] um aggregate uh uh use on second layers
[09:00] which are settling in these larger pches
[09:02] I mean there's all sorts of things that
[09:04] could kind of Drive the fees up and I'm
[09:08] imagining that in the future there's
[09:09] going to be lots of these kind of
[09:13] aggregate sources of demand which are
[09:16] happening offchain and and in aggregate
[09:19] onchain they're going to be paying
[09:20] exorbitant fees right really really high
[09:22] fees you'll be competing with you know
[09:25] those second layers you'll be competing
[09:26] with these like Ultra hyr net worth uals
[09:29] you'll be keep competing with you know
[09:31] these large institutions with nation
[09:34] states and so if Bitcoin succeeds and in
[09:37] in the ways that we believe it will
[09:39] right if it becomes the base layer
[09:42] monetary
[09:43] protocol for the whole world
[09:47] um it's going to have really high fees
[09:50] and so you know these fees we see now 16
[09:52] SATs per V for example like these are
[09:55] these are fees which are happening
[09:57] because we're just really early
[09:59] and you know relatively there's there's
[10:03] very few people using Bitcoin right now
[10:05] right it's probably like 0.1% of the
[10:09] population is actually using Bitcoin
[10:13] like on chain right a decent amount of
[10:15] people might have exposure to bitcoin
[10:17] but they aren't actually using Bitcoin
[10:19] they're not submitting transactions on
[10:21] chain taking taking it into self-
[10:23] custody you know using it to as as their
[10:27] money right they're they just have
[10:28] indirect disposure
[10:30] um so that's kind of I mean like that's
[10:33] that's the fear is that these fees are
[10:34] going to get really really high
[10:37] and I think what what we've seen happen
[10:41] um in these in these past fee spikes so
[10:43] if you actually if you go to this tab
[10:45] here um this shows you the the fees and
[10:49] this is just over the last two hours so
[10:51] if we expand this out to say a year so
[10:53] here you can see kind of like how how
[10:55] high the fees have spiked over the past
[10:57] year right and actually I think
[11:00] this one showing oh this isn't showing a
[11:02] whole year for some reason let's just do
[11:04] six months
[11:05] for yeah so so this this Spike right
[11:08] here was like the having Spike right
[11:10] when she's got really really ridiculous
[11:12] and they got up into like the hundreds
[11:14] if not thousands of sasper Vite just
[11:17] momentarily we've seen that happen a
[11:19] couple of times though right like these
[11:21] these spikes where we get up into the
[11:22] hundreds or thousands and those tend to
[11:25] happen during kind of these degenerate
[11:28] like you know shitcoin minting things
[11:31] that are
[11:31] happening right now um but the point is
[11:35] like it doesn't take much to push
[11:37] Bitcoin over the edge in terms of the
[11:39] fee rates all it takes is you know a
[11:41] handful of degenerates and if that's all
[11:44] it takes then imagine what it will take
[11:46] to push Bitcoin permanently into these
[11:49] ranges when you've got you know again
[11:53] like thousands of high netw worth
[11:55] individuals thousands of Institutions
[11:57] hundreds of nation states and
[12:00] potentially like dozens if not hundreds
[12:02] of second layers that are trying to
[12:04] compete for you know payments layers or
[12:08] you know different you uh privacy layers
[12:11] or like different things right there's
[12:13] going to be a lot of things built on top
[12:14] of Bitcoin and they're all going to be
[12:16] competing for the for the Bas layer
[12:18] block space okay
[12:21] um so going back to this you know we
[12:25] said 16 sa per V it makes a 2,400 at
[12:29] utxo dust thereabouts right if we were
[12:33] to 100x this um you know if the fee
[12:38] rates were stay 1,600 sets per V which I
[12:42] don't think is
[12:43] unreasonable that would make a 240,000
[12:46] set utxo dust did I get that math right
[12:50] yeah I think I
[12:52] did so so I mean so that's the concern
[12:55] right is like in in the very very high
[12:59] um fee rate
[13:01] environments you're going to have you
[13:03] know really really large amounts of of
[13:07] Bitcoin uh become dust
[13:10] because any any utxo that's smaller than
[13:13] you know like a couple hundred, stats
[13:16] will just become unpend otherwise you'll
[13:17] have to you spend more in fees to
[13:19] actually move it which doesn't make any
[13:21] sense so you would rather just not move
[13:23] it at all right if it's going to cost
[13:25] you more to move it than it's worth then
[13:27] it it's becomes worthless you know for
[13:29] all intensive
[13:31] purposes um and this kind of also
[13:34] Segways into like the the whole idea of
[13:36] like okay so what is the minimum utxo
[13:38] size that we might need right um it's
[13:43] highly dependent on what you think the
[13:47] Fe raise could get up to in the future
[13:49] and nobody knows the answer to that like
[13:51] nobody knows exactly how much people are
[13:54] going to be willing to pay in terms of
[13:56] Bitcoin um by the way a block just uh
[13:59] got confirmed there which is kind of fun
[14:01] to watch but anyways nobody knows how
[14:03] high the fees are going to get in the
[14:04] future so nobody really knows what the
[14:07] best utxo size
[14:09] is but in that example that I just
[14:11] walked through where these get a 100
[14:14] times more expensive right which I think
[14:17] again is like it's not unreasonable but
[14:20] it would be very expensive like I think
[14:23] people would think like oh wow bitcoin's
[14:25] super expensive to use if the fee rates
[14:28] were in the thousands of SATs per Vite
[14:30] right that'd be kind of crazy um and
[14:33] even in that case you're talking about
[14:36] utxo is worth a couple hundred thousand
[14:38] STS becoming
[14:39] dust um if you have a utxo that's worth
[14:43] a million stats you'll be able to move
[14:45] it but you'll pay like a a 10 to 20% fee
[14:48] to move it so it's not optimal but at
[14:51] least you're not getting completely
[14:53] wiped out from the
[14:55] fees that's why I always kind of say
[14:57] like the starting level um kind of the
[14:59] minimum threshold that you want to
[15:01] probably make most of your most of your
[15:03] utxo is about a million sets that's like
[15:06] the minimum I would have um and then I
[15:10] think you know you also want to kind of
[15:13] have larger ones as well right you might
[15:15] start by having a million set threshold
[15:18] and then after you stack a few million
[15:21] set utxos and if the fees are like low
[15:24] like they are now you might want to
[15:26] consider like okay and maybe I'll
[15:27] consolidate a few of these smaller 1
[15:30] million set utxo until like a larger 5
[15:32] million or 10 million set utxo just to
[15:35] give you a little bit more protection in
[15:37] the future if fees you be really high
[15:40] you know and consolidation just means
[15:43] that you take uh different OS in one uh
[15:48] transaction and therefore have a high
[15:52] uo yes yep so um going back to kind of
[15:56] how it works like you know when you're
[15:59] when you're when you're paying somebody
[16:01] if you need to pay them um a higher
[16:04] amount than your smallest utxl are worth
[16:09] then you have to use multiple utxl to
[16:12] pay them right you're you're literally
[16:14] like it's kind of like melting down all
[16:16] your pieces of gold into one piece to
[16:19] pay somebody with right um similarly you
[16:22] know same thing happens with etx well
[16:24] you you use a bunch of them to pay a
[16:26] larger amount um but you can also do
[16:28] that to yourself so like you can pay
[16:30] yourself um you
[16:33] know by combining all of your smaller
[16:36] utxl to make a bigger one and that's
[16:38] what we call utxo
[16:40] consolidation um it's also similar to
[16:43] like you know it's like it's like being
[16:45] your own bank right it's like being your
[16:46] own bank teller where you can give
[16:48] yourself a bunch of $1 bills and then
[16:50] get yourself back out like a $100 bill
[16:53] right um so you know Bitcoin allows you
[16:56] to do those things
[16:59] and is there any change when someone has
[17:01] a multi or something like that is is
[17:04] there a change to that you take so fresh
[17:07] is there like do you need
[17:09] more yes glad you asked so this is the
[17:14] second second uh slide I was going to
[17:17] share so
[17:19] um I have this uh reference table it's a
[17:23] it's a consolidation transaction utxo
[17:27] consolidation transaction fee reference
[17:29] table um I put this out on Twitter uh
[17:32] and you know I'll send you the link to
[17:34] this if you want to include it um but
[17:36] basically we look through this
[17:39] table I have um this is the amount of
[17:43] data that's required for typical single
[17:47] Sig transactions and so we have like a
[17:49] legacy transaction which is the you know
[17:52] typically if you if you see an address
[17:53] that starts with a one it's it's
[17:55] typically a legacy uh address right um
[17:59] Native segwit is the one that pretty
[18:01] much everyone uses nowadays like most
[18:03] people use native sigt so that's kind of
[18:04] the standard type of transaction and
[18:07] then the more the the more recent type
[18:09] the tap transaction um is is what the
[18:13] most recent softwork um
[18:15] enabled but these are all the different
[18:18] amounts of data that's required for each
[18:21] of these transactions so there's a
[18:22] little bit of overhead in each of them
[18:24] meaning just like some you know uh um
[18:29] standard data that's required for the
[18:31] transaction and then here is the amount
[18:34] of data required for every input that
[18:36] you add to the transaction and the
[18:38] amount of data required for every output
[18:40] that you add to each transaction okay so
[18:45] um when we were just talking about like
[18:48] spending Bitcoin right if you're
[18:49] spending Bitcoin and you have to spend
[18:51] with a lot of utxos for every single
[18:54] utxo that you add you have to add this
[18:57] much data right because this is the
[18:59] amount of data that's required for
[19:01] adding um the utxo and the signature to
[19:05] spend it right um and then likewise for
[19:09] every output that you're creating you
[19:11] know this the amount of data that's
[19:12] required so when cash app processes a
[19:17] batched transaction where they're paying
[19:20] out you know hundreds of plebs with
[19:23] their withdrawals for every single uh
[19:26] output that they're creating for every
[19:28] with drawal that that they're creating
[19:30] in that batch transaction they have to
[19:31] include this much data to pay that
[19:33] person out right to process that
[19:36] withdrawal this you know this this is
[19:38] basically just a table for like how much
[19:40] data is required and then here are some
[19:42] just quick examples of like the the
[19:45] overall data that would be required for
[19:47] a two input one output transaction five
[19:50] input one output 10 input one output 20
[19:53] input one output and these would be like
[19:55] you know kind of the typical amounts of
[19:57] data that would be required for a
[20:00] consolidation right typically when
[20:02] you're consolidating your utxos you're
[20:04] you know you're
[20:06] you're putting uh I don't know like a
[20:09] handful of inputs right a handful of
[20:11] your smaller utxl as inputs and then
[20:14] you're creating one larger ET XL as an
[20:17] output so anyways this is for single Sig
[20:19] right and then down here this is for a
[20:23] multisig um so same type of table right
[20:27] we have our overhead data
[20:29] and then the amount of data required per
[20:31] input and per output okay so you'll
[20:37] notice that the inputs are a lot more
[20:38] expensive right so again kind of as a
[20:41] reference it was 68 virtual bytes per
[20:45] input for a single Sig right for a
[20:49] multi- if you have a two of three it's
[20:52] 104 so it's uh maybe about 50% more data
[20:56] that's required per input if you have
[20:58] have a three of five then it's you know
[21:00] it's closer to double the amount of data
[21:02] required um and then a four of seven
[21:04] which it's not the four of seven is not
[21:06] very common um but you can just see
[21:08] right it gets it gets it requires more
[21:11] and more data the larger and larger the
[21:14] the utxo or sorry the the larger and
[21:17] larger the multisig gets right the
[21:18] Quorum of keys in the multisig so I
[21:22] think you know just to kind of focus
[21:24] ourselves here we probably want to
[21:26] compare like a single Sig with a two of
[21:30] three multisig because that's what most
[21:32] people are dealing
[21:34] with when we are
[21:37] considering
[21:39] a 10 in and one put uh
[21:46] consolidation um it's going to require
[21:49] about a, about 1100 virtual bytes of
[21:52] data for a two of3 multisig for a um
[21:59] for a single Sig yeah for a single Sig
[22:02] right this uh Native segwit one it's
[22:06] 720 virtual btes um so again it's about
[22:10] 50% more right that's kind of that's
[22:13] what I was saying and like that's you
[22:14] can kind of just give it a ballpark 50%
[22:17] more so multisig is going to cost about
[22:19] 50% more to transact with on average um
[22:23] when compared to a single Sig so when
[22:26] you're dealing with a multi- you
[22:28] probably want to shoot for a minimum
[22:31] utfl size of like 1.5 million sets maybe
[22:36] even 2 million sets just to give you a
[22:38] little extra
[22:39] buffer um but yeah you you want to have
[22:41] larger utxo with multisig in general um
[22:45] long story short I know that was we went
[22:48] through a lot of stuff right there but I
[22:50] don't know any questions with this table
[22:52] Yeah I think this is uh extremely
[22:54] helpful with with uh people uh I never
[22:57] saw this t was really really cool see
[23:00] the table from you usually follow your
[23:02] stuff but this is a really cool table I
[23:05] love it the overviews with the multi how
[23:07] much is it actually and like two out of
[23:10] three and three out of five or like the
[23:12] more common ones never so I think four
[23:14] of seven uh and the question for me is
[23:17] not and when we have uh uh those those
[23:21] High you Tak o uh depending on like the
[23:24] system is what it is but uh for people
[23:27] that are now not capable of the the main
[23:30] layer it's a little bit off topic now
[23:32] but um what what Solutions uh do you see
[23:36] as uh for transacting on the base layer
[23:39] is is the solution just Layer Two or
[23:41] just being on some second layer third
[23:43] layer uh or are there any developments
[23:46] for like that getting better probably
[23:49] not because like you you need the higher
[23:51] fees to pay the miners right right yeah
[23:54] so for for Bitcoin to succeed it needs
[23:57] to have um High fees that's just kind of
[24:00] you know I mean and you you hear about
[24:02] like you know you get this fud of um
[24:06] like security budget fud right that's
[24:08] basically people who believe
[24:11] that the users of Bitcoin won't be
[24:14] willing to pay high fees to use it um
[24:17] they believe that
[24:18] eventually um fees won't pay miners once
[24:23] the subsidies go to zero right because
[24:26] we all know the subsidy keeps getting
[24:27] cut in half every four years having
[24:30] is and eventually you would expect the
[24:33] fees to kind of take over right I mean
[24:37] there's a reason why it's called a block
[24:38] reward subsidy right it's subsidizing
[24:40] the network while it gets bootstrapped
[24:43] and then by the time it gets you know to
[24:45] to full adoption um to full saturation
[24:48] Bas layer users then you would expect
[24:51] the fee Market to have matured and to
[24:54] effectively take
[24:56] over in paying the minor in in their
[24:59] entirety right so in my opinion I mean
[25:03] if if if fees don't if if if fees don't
[25:07] mature and actually start paying the
[25:09] miners as the subsidy keeps getting cut
[25:11] in half over and over then Bitcoin fails
[25:14] I that's just the truth right you need
[25:16] you need the fees in order to um you
[25:20] know in order to pay the miners in order
[25:21] to secure the network and so I just work
[25:24] off the base assumption that that will
[25:26] happen I mean I think that there's no
[25:28] reason to believe it won't um people are
[25:31] going to want to use Bitcoin to secure
[25:32] their value because it's it's the best
[25:36] store value we've ever seen right it's
[25:38] it's it's leak proof and it's kind of
[25:40] like a self-fulfilling prophecy it's
[25:42] like you know the more valuable Bitcoin
[25:45] gets the more users it attracts the
[25:48] higher net worth users it attracts um
[25:51] the higher fees they're willing to pay
[25:54] the more hash rate comes online to
[25:56] secure the network the more valuable
[25:58] coin becomes the higher you know net
[26:01] worth individuals it attracts to use it
[26:04] to store their value right and it just
[26:05] goes over and over and over like these
[26:06] Cycles until it literally sucks in
[26:09] everybody right at least everyone who
[26:11] can afford to use it and with each cycle
[26:14] you kind of you know like you're sucking
[26:16] in
[26:18] um uh wealthier users and in doing so
[26:23] you're also kind of pricing out poorer
[26:26] ones right because Bitcoin as a network
[26:29] is limited
[26:31] in how many um transactions it can
[26:35] actually settle so you know for every
[26:40] for every user that starts using Bitcoin
[26:42] I mean at a certain point right we
[26:44] haven't reached that full kind of
[26:45] saturation yet and so we can still have
[26:48] users come in and they're not
[26:49] necessarily like crowding out current
[26:51] users but at a certain point you reach a
[26:54] full
[26:55] saturation um and that might be around
[26:57] like five to 10 million users something
[27:00] like that right and then at that point
[27:03] for every new user that wants to come in
[27:05] and use Bitcoin they have to outbid one
[27:07] of the current users and that current
[27:09] user who's like at the the kind of the
[27:12] lower end of of the wealth spectrum they
[27:14] get they get pressed out and they no
[27:16] longer can use the base
[27:18] layer so I don't know when we're going
[27:20] to reach that full saturation probably
[27:23] won't be this cycle hopefully not I hope
[27:26] we have more time than just one more
[27:27] cycle
[27:28] but you know maybe in two or three or
[27:30] four Cycles we'll kind of reach this
[27:34] this point where um we've got you know
[27:37] like we consistently have maybe like 10
[27:40] million Bas layer users who are settling
[27:42] every month on chain right they maybe
[27:45] they like they you know they're saving
[27:48] in Bitcoin on exchanges or on other
[27:50] second layers for a month or two and
[27:53] then they settle that on chain to like
[27:55] you know get into self- custody and
[27:57] secure it
[27:58] and if you have 10 million users doing
[28:00] that on a monthly basis um that uses up
[28:04] all the block SP and there's none left
[28:06] for anyone else so you
[28:10] know eventually Bitcoin becomes a system
[28:13] for the 10 million top um entities who
[28:18] want to settle on chain and those
[28:20] entities don't necessarily have to be
[28:21] individuals they could be institutions
[28:23] they could be second layers themselves
[28:25] who are settling on chain um and you
[28:28] know again they could be like nation
[28:29] states
[28:30] even yeah and I think uh the the
[28:34] important part to take away from from
[28:36] the first section here with the UNS
[28:38] spendable UT Tak or um if you have the
[28:42] chance to consolidate Bitcoin uh at a
[28:45] low fee rate c as as we have it
[28:47] currently as we will see it throughout
[28:50] the next periods um you should
[28:52] definitely do it and I think uh also
[28:54] with this threshold with 1 million as we
[28:57] made examples I hope I get the numbers
[28:59] now right but if the as we said before
[29:02] the the fees let's say uh 100x which is
[29:05] not unreasonable uh then you still have
[29:08] to pay for 1 million SS at 25 uh% fee
[29:13] which me if you have the chance to
[29:15] consolidate a 10 million for toi or
[29:18] maybe like 20 million toi this will drop
[29:21] like your percentage of of the fee in in
[29:24] the future uh when you have a lot of UT
[29:27] hold you want to to spend did I get this
[29:30] right yeah that's correct yeah and the
[29:33] idea is
[29:35] like
[29:36] um when you're
[29:38] considering trying to optimize for
[29:42] future High fee environments it's like
[29:45] you're going to have to pay the fee
[29:46] eventually to move your utxos right
[29:49] that's I mean you can't move your
[29:51] Bitcoin without paying the fee yeah
[29:54] right so you might as well kind of
[29:57] preemptively do the do the
[29:59] consolidations of your smaller utxos
[30:02] while fees are low so that you don't
[30:04] have to consolidate them in the future
[30:06] while fees are High
[30:09] um and you know what you what you
[30:11] definitely don't want to do I I think
[30:13] again like I just want to I I want to
[30:15] emphasize this because you know some
[30:18] people I think might be a little too
[30:20] scared of of kind of how quickly fees
[30:22] might ramp up and I don't want to like I
[30:25] don't want to suggest that it's going to
[30:26] happen you know
[30:28] anytime soon and then stay that way I
[30:30] think we still have a little bit of time
[30:32] left to kind of figure everything
[30:34] out um but when fees are low right when
[30:38] they come back down when they when they
[30:39] settle down when you
[30:42] know um these different shitcoin
[30:45] protocols that are using a lot of block
[30:47] space when they kind of Peter out and um
[30:51] B Slayer usage dies down a bit that's
[30:53] the time to strike right like as just as
[30:55] a Bitcoin user if you've got any utxos
[30:58] that are kind of small or you want to
[31:00] you know kind of clean up your your utxo
[31:03] set that's the time that You' want to do
[31:05] it right you consolidate at those points
[31:07] maybe even if you've got some um some
[31:10] Bitcoin that's still sitting on
[31:11] exchanges and even if it's a smaller
[31:13] utxo you know withdraw it and then
[31:15] consolidate it right like you can do
[31:17] that in a one two step and you can do it
[31:19] like you know fairly cheaply if the fees
[31:22] are low once the fees get high though
[31:26] that's when you kind of want to hunker
[31:28] down and just be like okay well you know
[31:30] like I've got i' I've got my my self-
[31:33] custody on chain Bitcoin and coal
[31:35] storage and that's like my you know
[31:37] long-term hle
[31:39] position and then I've got um you know
[31:42] my more recent savings which maybe
[31:46] you're stacking on an exchange maybe
[31:49] you're stacking and you're withdrawing
[31:51] it to like a second layer like liquid or
[31:55] maybe you're withdrawing it to I mean
[31:57] maybe you even have like a lightning
[31:59] Channel set up and you're withdrawing it
[32:00] to
[32:01] lightning and um you know like you're
[32:05] all set to you have a non-custodial
[32:06] lightning Channel I mean that'd be
[32:09] awesome but not everyone's going to have
[32:11] that um but the point is like when the
[32:14] fees are high you kind of like you have
[32:17] to adapt and you have to figure out ways
[32:20] to continue stacking Bitcoin even though
[32:23] you're not necessarily going to be able
[32:25] to always withdraw it on chain right
[32:27] away right you might have to like take
[32:29] longer to stack a larger amount before
[32:31] you could take it on
[32:33] chain what's going to be interesting
[32:36] though is when um Bitcoin gets extremely
[32:42] valuable and getting up to a million sat
[32:45] utxl becomes like fairly unreachable to
[32:49] the average person at least you know in
[32:53] any reasonable amount of time right like
[32:55] imagine I mean right now right a million
[32:56] set utxo is is close to 600 bucks right
[33:01] um that's how much it costs now and I
[33:04] mean that's already like you know for a
[33:06] lot of people that's already a decent
[33:07] amount of money to save up um and we're
[33:12] saying like don't take that into self-
[33:15] custody until you have that amount saved
[33:17] up minimum right like maybe even more
[33:20] but like that's the minimum now imagine
[33:24] if Bitcoin were to go to a million
[33:25] dollars of Bitcoin
[33:27] now we're saying don't take any don't
[33:30] take that Bitcoin into self- custody
[33:31] until you have $110,000 worth of bitcoin
[33:34] saved up minimum I mean that's a that's
[33:36] a very different playing field and a
[33:39] very different
[33:41] um
[33:43] uh shift imperative right because we're
[33:46] no longer saying not your keys not your
[33:48] Bitcoin we're saying well if you don't
[33:51] have $10,000 wor a value then like you
[33:54] have to pick a custodian right like you
[33:58] have to pick you have to pick a second
[34:00] layer or a custodian that has different
[34:02] trust uh
[34:04] tradeoffs um and you know just pray you
[34:08] don't get rugged and like that that
[34:10] becomes a very different um environment
[34:14] and one that I
[34:17] think you know bit bitcoiners will have
[34:20] to grow when we get there and we when we
[34:23] might get there pretty quickly right I
[34:25] mean I don't know when we'll get to a
[34:26] million dollars of Bitcoin
[34:28] maybe the cycle maybe next maybe the one
[34:30] after that who knows we'll get there
[34:31] eventually and when we do like we're
[34:34] going to have to deal with these
[34:35] problems if we don't already have um
[34:39] better self- custody scaling Solutions
[34:43] which currently we don't I told you a
[34:45] lot about 21 Bitcoin the best place for
[34:47] me to buy Bitcoin directly on a Bitcoin
[34:50] only exchange but now let's talk about
[34:53] how to secure your Bitcoin once you got
[34:55] Bitcoin you don't want to leave them on
[34:57] next exchange you want to take self
[35:00] custody you want to take responsibility
[35:03] of your own Bitcoin that's why I
[35:05] recommend getting a bitbox bitbox is an
[35:08] amazing wallet where you can not only
[35:11] keep your Bitcoin in a simple way very
[35:14] secure you can even create a passphrase
[35:17] with that passphrase you can basically
[35:19] create a hidden wallet on the device
[35:22] itself make sure to buy your bitbox in
[35:26] the link down in the description
[35:28] and with code Robin you even get a 5%
[35:31] discount what would be uh I
[35:34] mean future question uh but what would
[35:38] be uh solutions to that like is I I feel
[35:42] like education is a big part of it even
[35:44] from exchanges education like not even
[35:47] like podcast education stuff like that
[35:48] even from exchanges to say like okay if
[35:50] you want to have this in your uh
[35:53] Hardware wallet just keep in mind utxo
[35:55] management or like what
[35:58] you can watch this video about uto
[35:59] management if you want to withdraw such
[36:01] a small amount uh like there's a lot of
[36:04] different angles and stuff like that we
[36:06] can do but on top of that on top of
[36:08] Education what do you think are like
[36:10] scaling solutions for self custody yeah
[36:13] um scaling solutions for self- custody
[36:17] so the problem with scaling self-
[36:20] custody
[36:22] currently is that we have no mechanism
[36:25] to um give users self- custody on higher
[36:31] layers
[36:33] without putting data on
[36:35] chain so self- custody regardless of
[36:39] which layer you're talking about whether
[36:41] you're talking about just straight up
[36:43] onchain self- custody right Bas layer
[36:46] self- custody or even self- custody on
[36:50] Lightning both of those require an
[36:52] onchain footprint right self- custody on
[36:55] lightning is literally all that means is
[36:58] you own the keys right or or you own one
[37:02] of the keys um that can spend from the
[37:08] utxo which is the lightning channel so
[37:11] every lightning channel is a utxo by the
[37:13] way I don't enough I mean most people
[37:15] don't think of it like that but every
[37:17] lightning channel is in utxo so if you
[37:19] have non-custodial lightning all it
[37:21] means is that you control you know part
[37:24] of that utxo you're sharing it with your
[37:26] lightning Channel counterparty you're
[37:29] sharing that utxo with your counterparty
[37:31] right it's a it's like a twers shared
[37:33] utxo um and if it's noncustodial on your
[37:36] end it just means that you have the keys
[37:38] to to you know settle that that utxo and
[37:41] then take your STS out of it so the
[37:44] limitations with scaling currently is
[37:47] you know we we only are able to do
[37:49] shared utxos with two with two parties
[37:52] right maybe three like if we really push
[37:55] the limits some people have been talking
[37:57] about having like you know three-party
[38:00] channels in lightning or or in other
[38:02] kind of second layer designs but the
[38:04] complexity of of of allowing for that to
[38:08] happen it it it gets kind of out of
[38:10] control pretty quickly um so it doesn't
[38:13] you know it doesn't scale past like
[38:16] three right and two is like really kind
[38:19] of all we're doing currently is a two
[38:22] party shared
[38:24] dtxl in theory if we want to skip
[38:28] self- custody we need to allow for more
[38:30] people to share utxos right we need to
[38:33] scale that higher so that it's you know
[38:35] dozens hundreds maybe even thousands of
[38:38] people sharing um a single ETO and
[38:42] that's really the only way you can scale
[38:44] self- custody is if you allow for that
[38:46] to
[38:48] happen the only way that I know of to
[38:51] allow for that to happen is with an
[38:54] update called covenants and there's a
[38:57] few different proposals for you know a
[38:59] couple of different flavors of covenants
[39:02] right I think the most popular of which
[39:04] is um CTV or check template
[39:09] verify um but yeah it's it's an update
[39:11] called covenants and it basically you
[39:13] know in short allows for you
[39:17] to share utxos amongst a lot more people
[39:21] basically yeah we had uh the topic of
[39:25] government and CV in
[39:28] not covered on the podcast but I think
[39:30] at least five guests of mine already
[39:33] brought it up and said like support that
[39:37] or like at least look into it or educate
[39:39] yourself about that uh and I think there
[39:41] like uh the I think the more more the
[39:45] most important message to to people is
[39:47] like similar to like bu the DI if like
[39:50] price of Bitcoin is low uh but also when
[39:54] the B rate is low of Bitcoin
[39:58] Network consolidate your things like the
[40:02] someone is creative and makes a nice
[40:05] line out of it there's probably a way to
[40:07] do it with B dip and consolidate uh your
[40:10] your Bitcoin you take SCE um but let's
[40:14] get to the next part of it because we
[40:17] current now the part of like unspent
[40:20] unspent dust that's of bitco network but
[40:23] the next part why you dig all management
[40:26] is so important is
[40:27] privacy uh so like how
[40:30] is Utes o management impacting the
[40:34] Privacy uh and this like consol
[40:36] consolidating a lot of os like the
[40:39] against the pacy aspect because you're
[40:41] like saying okay this all this my
[40:43] Bitcoin if they were separated
[40:46] before yeah um yeah so yeah the next
[40:49] part of utxl management is privacy and
[40:52] actually I think um utxl management
[40:55] started kind of more focused on privacy
[40:59] because back in the day nobody really
[41:02] worried about having dust utxos right
[41:04] when fees were super low and when you
[41:08] know when a 100 bucks used to be able to
[41:10] buy you a million sets or more right
[41:13] people just generally
[41:15] were by default withdrawing from
[41:18] exchanges in larger chunks just because
[41:20] those chunks were were cheaper in terms
[41:22] of dollars right um so the focus uh
[41:26] originally with big coin was always kind
[41:28] of a privacy focused um discussion when
[41:30] it came to utxl
[41:32] management and the idea is because
[41:35] Bitcoin is an
[41:37] open um Ledger right anybody can
[41:40] download the blockchain and literally
[41:42] see every single transaction that's ever
[41:45] happened since the beginning of
[41:47] Bitcoin um any transaction that you
[41:51] do uh will be permanently recorded in
[41:55] the blockchain forever so so the
[41:57] histories of um any utxos that you spend
[42:02] together will be linked forever and you
[42:05] can't undo it um when when when you you
[42:09] know when you submit that transaction
[42:13] so if you were to say um let's say that
[42:17] you've been stacking Bitcoin for a
[42:19] number of years and most of your Bitcoin
[42:23] has just been withdrawals from exchanges
[42:26] right you just buy Bitcoin on an
[42:28] exchange you withdraw it every month or
[42:29] whatever and that's most your Bitcoin
[42:32] but then you also have some Bitcoin that
[42:33] you've receed um maybe as gifts or for
[42:37] doing some work right if you're not
[42:41] careful and if
[42:42] you accidentally you know consolidate
[42:45] those utxl or even just spend them
[42:47] together with some of your Bitcoin that
[42:50] came from the
[42:53] exchanges you link the histories of
[42:56] those of those utxos and so now all of
[42:59] the sudden your exchange that you merg
[43:03] those those utxos with um that exchange
[43:06] knows about your other Bitcoin right
[43:09] which I previously hadn't known about so
[43:11] like uh you know if you if you spend
[43:14] some of your cash app Bitcoin with some
[43:16] of the Bitcoin you got from your friend
[43:18] Bob then all of a sudden cash app is
[43:20] like oh that those are some utxos we
[43:22] didn't know belonged to Wicked but now
[43:25] that he's spending them along IDE some
[43:27] of the utxl that we sent in and that
[43:30] we've been tracking because the
[43:32] government forces us to track them now
[43:34] we know that he also has access to this
[43:36] other Bitcoin right so we'll put that in
[43:39] our system and send that off to the
[43:41] government whenever they ask for it um
[43:45] but from a privacy perspective it's very
[43:46] important to like keep
[43:50] your
[43:51] particular stacks of Bitcoin separate
[43:54] that you don't want their histories um
[43:58] to be merged together so typically like
[44:00] you keep your nonky Bitcoin in a
[44:04] completely different wallet than your
[44:06] kyc Bitcoin maybe you even have like you
[44:10] know different wallets for every
[44:13] different um non kyc source of Bitcoin
[44:18] that you that you get it from so like if
[44:20] you're mining you have like a mining
[44:21] nonk WC wallet if you're you know
[44:25] fettling funds from lightning maybe you
[44:27] have like a non kyc lightning settlement
[44:31] wallet right if you if you're receiving
[44:34] gifts maybe you have like a non KC gift
[44:35] wallet or something like that right so
[44:37] like um by keeping these in separate
[44:40] wallets you kind of ensure that those
[44:43] utxl will never get accidentally
[44:45] Consolidated together okay the other way
[44:49] that you can do this um which is
[44:51] probably easier from a management
[44:53] perspective because you're not dealing
[44:54] with a bunch of different wallets is you
[44:56] can just have have you know one wallet
[44:59] and then label everything so um as long
[45:03] as you're as long as your software
[45:06] wallet allows you to label your utxos
[45:08] you know you should you should
[45:09] definitely get into the habit of
[45:11] labeling them um mostly just with like
[45:16] where they came from so just keeping
[45:18] track of where each utxl came from right
[45:21] did this one come from that exchange did
[45:23] this one come you know from my friend
[45:25] Joe did this one come from
[45:28] um the change I got back when I paid for
[45:32] my dinner or whatever right just like
[45:34] keep track of those things um and then
[45:36] then that way you can um you can you can
[45:40] kind of like better select the chunks
[45:42] you want to spend in the future so you
[45:45] know like yeah like you don't want to
[45:48] spend certain part certain Bitcoin on
[45:50] certain things if you don't want it to
[45:52] be kind of linked in different ways so
[45:55] that's that's kind of the overall
[45:57] it's like bringing transparency in your
[46:00] own wallet so you can not bring
[46:03] transparency in the governments and
[46:06] institutional wallets to for for you to
[46:09] be identified as as as people so so yeah
[46:14] part and then and then the other part is
[46:16] like when you're spending Bitcoin the
[46:19] person you're spending it with they see
[46:21] the uto that you spent right like they
[46:23] can see the the the sized chunk that you
[46:26] spent
[46:27] and so if you're buying something that's
[46:31] relatively low cost but you're using a
[46:34] really big chunk of Bitcoin purchase it
[46:37] they're going to see that you just got a
[46:39] bunch of like you're like basically so
[46:42] if someone's charging again going back
[46:44] to the example in the beginning if
[46:46] someone's charging you a million sets
[46:48] for something and you spend a 10 million
[46:50] set utxo they're going to see that you
[46:52] just got 9 million sets back as change
[46:55] right as a brand new utx so and if
[46:58] that's very very expensive if that's
[47:00] very valuable um especially if this is
[47:03] like an in-person
[47:05] transaction there could be some concerns
[47:07] with privacy and security there because
[47:11] you know they might be incentivized to
[47:13] rob you at that point so the other
[47:16] aspect of privacy
[47:18] is um being aware of the utfl that
[47:22] you're spending in order to kind of
[47:24] spend the right size jump right you're
[47:27] not going to whip out like a kilogram
[47:30] gold bar to buy you know a grams worth
[47:32] of gold in it when you're you know like
[47:35] if you're spending gold right like think
[47:37] think back back in the days right
[47:39] spending like a little grams worth of
[47:40] gold to buy you know a bushel of
[47:42] whatever apples or something you're not
[47:44] going to like whip out a a kilogram gold
[47:46] bar and chop off a little gram of it um
[47:50] because the Merchant's going to be like
[47:52] holy [ __ ] that guy's got a kilogram gold
[47:54] bar let's Rob him when he goes back to
[47:57] his you know his cart or
[48:00] whatever same that that's really
[48:02] interesting to think about because um
[48:05] like I don't know what has US Dollars
[48:08] $500 notes or what is the highest nor US
[48:11] Dollars 100 100 yeah like in in Euros
[48:15] there's like a 500 euro uh note yeah and
[48:20] I actually never had one in in my hand I
[48:22] don't know how they look actually uh but
[48:24] it's like the when you buy like a back
[48:27] of Che in gome for like one EUR and you
[48:29] pay with like a 500 uh Euro thing it's
[48:33] it's it's kind of that example even
[48:35] though like 500 EUR is is um like maybe
[48:39] not as much as you would like maybe like
[48:42] you have a full Bitcoin uh in in in the
[48:44] future and it's like a lot worth and
[48:47] you're buying something small with it
[48:48] and then the person on the other side
[48:50] he's like oh [ __ ] there's like 100
[48:53] million uh Satoshi you Tak so there so
[48:57] like that's that's interesting to think
[48:59] about that with a transaction you see
[49:02] the the full volume of of the the wallet
[49:05] or the the U Tak so yeah uh yeah that
[49:10] the value of TI are being and so this is
[49:14] you kind of bring up an interesting
[49:15] point though because you know we're
[49:17] talking about it's interesting that the
[49:21] the largest denomination of euro is 500
[49:24] EUR right and the smallest recommended
[49:30] denomination of utxl as a Bitcoin is
[49:33] currently worth about
[49:36] 600 right maybe a little bit maybe like
[49:38] maybe closer to like 500 euro right like
[49:41] a 1 million sat utxl is probably around
[49:43] 500 euro right now right so it's almost
[49:46] like it's like inverted where it's like
[49:48] the largest denomination in Euros is 500
[49:51] and the smallest denomination in in in
[49:53] Bitcoin currently is worth about 500
[49:57] so because of this um you know it begs a
[50:01] question like well how are you going to
[50:03] spend on very small things right if if
[50:07] the chunks if all the chunks are
[50:09] supposed to be around 500 EUR currently
[50:13] in value all right or a million stats if
[50:16] you just want to keep denominating in
[50:17] terms of Bitcoin are you going to buy
[50:20] things that are worth less than 500 EUR
[50:24] I mean and this is where
[50:27] second layers come in right and and um
[50:31] things that are optimized for like
[50:32] moving smaller amounts so things like
[50:36] lightning um and you know there will be
[50:39] other second layers that emerge over the
[50:41] next decade that will probably be even
[50:45] more optimized um you know for spending
[50:48] or or or or transacting right in smaller
[50:54] amounts um or transacting privately for
[50:58] example
[51:00] so go ahead I know I was just like uh
[51:04] like as I imagine it um it would be like
[51:07] you have a bigger Chunk in like your
[51:09] self custody onchain wallet and then
[51:13] once a quarter or like once a month or
[51:16] something like that you take from there
[51:19] uh to like a hay wallet could be Layer
[51:22] Two solution it could be whatever you're
[51:25] paying with like light
[51:27] uh and from there you can then buy your
[51:30] coffee or buy your chewing gum and then
[51:33] it's like uh then then people don't see
[51:36] out of what you have and you don't have
[51:38] to spend the transaction fees uh is is
[51:41] that what you you're going to yeah
[51:44] exactly so the way I imagine um Bitcoin
[51:48] will work in the future and and and
[51:50] again this will be for you know for the
[51:53] 10 million lucky people who are still
[51:56] able to transact on chain right um and
[51:59] who still have utxos that are large
[52:01] enough to actually
[52:03] spend what they'll end up doing is um
[52:07] semi-regularly they'll kind of top off
[52:09] their their their checking account right
[52:13] so to speak right they're they're
[52:14] spending balances which will be on
[52:16] second layers and so you could imagine
[52:19] what this might look like
[52:21] is maybe once every few months um you
[52:25] will lift you're you I think technically
[52:29] like the term might be called lift right
[52:33] this is I think it's this is the term
[52:34] that's used by um Barack when he when he
[52:38] talks about his Arc idea for his second
[52:41] layer um but anyways the idea is like
[52:43] you lift the utxl up onto the second
[52:45] layer and then once it's there um once
[52:48] the Bitcoin is there or committed to
[52:50] that second layer then you can move it
[52:52] around offchain um kind of
[52:55] frictionlessly and and a lot cheaper and
[52:57] in smaller amounts right and so you'll
[53:01] pay the onchain fee to get the Bitcoin
[53:03] onto the second layer but then once it's
[53:05] on the second layer you know you can
[53:08] transact in much smaller
[53:10] denominations um and and and just much
[53:13] more efficiently up there that's kind of
[53:16] what's already happening I mean like to
[53:18] an extent that's already what's
[53:19] happening currently just at a much
[53:21] smaller scale right I think Bitcoin as a
[53:24] medum up exchange is
[53:27] um super widespread in terms of its use
[53:31] right we've got these um these kind of
[53:36] beginning uh inkings of like an
[53:39] emerging um Market of of you know
[53:42] lightning service providers and these
[53:44] custodia wallets which are all linked
[53:46] together with lightning and then you've
[53:48] you're even starting to like link other
[53:52] um layers like liquid with lightning
[53:55] right like they're linking liquid
[53:57] through lightning to other layers and so
[54:00] I think eventually what you have in the
[54:03] Bitcoin ecosystem is you have you know
[54:05] the base layer and then on top of that
[54:07] you have all these other layers which
[54:09] are probably all going to be linked
[54:11] together with lightning right you can
[54:14] have like liquid and um and your
[54:18] exchange um a lightning Channel you
[54:20] could have liquid and a sediment have a
[54:22] lightning Channel um you could have Arc
[54:26] you know which is this future idea of a
[54:29] covenants enabled um shared utxl scheme
[54:32] you have Arc and you know fent together
[54:35] with a lightning channel so like
[54:37] lightning will be like kind of like the
[54:38] glue or like the highways that link
[54:40] together all of the custodians as well
[54:43] as all of the um second layers and
[54:46] shared dxo and
[54:48] whatnot and
[54:50] then um yeah and then everything is is
[54:54] still you know link back to the base
[54:56] layer because all of these custodians
[54:59] and all of these second layers like they
[55:02] all still operate under the utxo model
[55:05] so at some point like the Bitcoin that
[55:07] is represented on that layer or the
[55:10] Bitcoin that is being held by those
[55:14] custodians has to be on chain in a
[55:17] utxo right so that's kind of like how
[55:19] everything links back to the base layer
[55:21] is through those
[55:22] utxos for me it's like now we're coming
[55:24] closer to the end of the the podcast uh
[55:27] and I want just quickly like have my two
[55:30] key learnings from from the podcast uh
[55:33] and maybe you can add something if you
[55:35] feel like there's something more like
[55:37] there's a key learning missing the one
[55:39] is like consolidate your utxos while you
[55:42] still have the chance and while the fees
[55:45] are low if you can uh and this the this
[55:49] was like a first one and the second one
[55:51] it would be like don't mix your KC stack
[55:54] with a non KC stack
[55:56] uh and especially all in F like you can
[56:00] if you want don't uh mix your non
[56:03] different nonc Stacks uh if you if you
[56:07] able to do also that uh is is that like
[56:10] the two main and key learnings uh from
[56:13] from this video today or like is there
[56:15] something to add those are the two key
[56:17] ones and um the third thing that I would
[56:21] maybe just say kind of with the last uh
[56:27] rant I I I just went on I know I've been
[56:29] I've been kind of all over the place so
[56:30] I'm sorry about that um but the third
[56:33] thing I would say is you know we're
[56:36] still extremely early when it comes to
[56:38] bitcoin right there's like there's all
[56:41] of these ideas which have yet to be
[56:44] built um they may never actually come to
[56:47] fruition but a lot of them will in the
[56:51] next decade will have a lot of different
[56:55] options when it comes to you know
[56:57] different layers or different custodial
[56:59] arrangements or different ways of taking
[57:02] your Bitcoin into self- custody right
[57:04] maybe even directly on second layers
[57:07] eventually so because we're so early you
[57:11] have to realize like um you know this is
[57:14] a moving Target
[57:16] right and and you have to like really
[57:19] kind of stay involved and pay attention
[57:22] to
[57:24] the the the changing um landscape of
[57:29] what Bitcoin is and how it is used
[57:32] because we haven't really figured out
[57:34] like exactly how we're going to use this
[57:36] thing in the end we don't know exactly
[57:38] how we're going to scale it to hundreds
[57:41] of millions of not billions of
[57:43] people and so while we're figuring this
[57:46] out um it's important for you as an
[57:49] early adopter and as a current you know
[57:52] user to keep tabs on all these things
[57:55] and like as these new technologies and
[57:57] these new layers emerge you have to
[58:00] understand whether they are legitimate
[58:05] ways to store your Bitcoin um and ways
[58:08] which you know ultimately could save you
[58:11] on fees or make your transactions more
[58:14] private um or you know all these other
[58:16] things that you might care about right
[58:20] so as a like so just to summarize as as
[58:23] an early user like you have to kind of
[58:25] just you have to like stay involved you
[58:27] can't just really like I mean okay if if
[58:30] you have a if you have a [ __ ] ton of
[58:31] Bitcoin like let's say you just have
[58:33] like a whole Bitcoin or even more right
[58:36] you can just sit on that utxl and you'll
[58:38] be fine you could come back in a decade
[58:40] or two and whatever the landscape is at
[58:42] that point you know you can assess and
[58:44] you can say okay that looks like the
[58:45] best second layer I'm going to lift some
[58:47] Bitcoin up onto there and then I'll be
[58:49] able to spend on that that's fine but
[58:51] for most people who are coming in now
[58:54] who aren't coming in with like whole bit
[58:56] coins or they're just stacking smaller
[58:58] amounts and they're trying to like save
[58:59] up as much as possible they might only
[59:02] have a few million stats um and if
[59:05] you're in that position you know you
[59:07] have to pay close attention
[59:09] because um you're going to be affected a
[59:13] lot more you're going to be much more
[59:14] fee sensitive than those larger
[59:18] participants and so you have to be
[59:20] nimble and able to um move your you know
[59:26] relatively smaller amount of Bitcoin up
[59:28] onto second layers like when the time is
[59:30] right okay um you know and some people
[59:33] are already kind of doing that right
[59:36] like some people are just stacking on
[59:39] liquid right or some people are just
[59:41] like stacking directly into a lightning
[59:44] Channel um or some people are just
[59:46] leaving their Bitcoin on an exchange
[59:48] because they don't want to deal with all
[59:49] this right and that's and honestly
[59:51] that's fine too like you know this it's
[59:52] not for everybody not highly recommended
[59:55] but like you know I understand like you
[59:58] know like we're getting to the point now
[60:00] where there's just so many people who
[60:01] are starting to get involved in Bitcoin
[60:03] that there's going to be a large array
[60:06] of the types of ways in which people
[60:09] interface with Bitcoin so yeah just you
[60:12] know stay involved if you if you want to
[60:14] be a sovereign Bitcoin user you have to
[60:17] keep paying attention you have to keep
[60:19] learning um and you know all those other
[60:23] things that you said earlier about etx
[60:26] management so that's why everybody
[60:28] that's why everybody should follow vicet
[60:30] on on Twitter
[60:33] and yeah I mean I you know I I I'm I'm
[60:37] probably I'm not I'm not a I'm not a I
[60:39] don't know like I I try I try to put out
[60:41] good content but there's there's
[60:43] definitely a lot of other people who are
[60:45] who are very good followers as well so
[60:47] you know follow an array of bitcoiners
[60:49] you get full spectrum of of knowledge
[60:52] and um you know and I don't know just
[60:57] mess around with Bitcoin like use it
[60:59] right like actually use it and then
[61:01] you'll get a sense of how it works um
[61:05] and uh you'll become a better more well
[61:08] equ equipped Bitcoin user if you
[61:10] actually use it that that's why I kind
[61:13] of started all the podcast because I
[61:15] wanted to have some video format of my
[61:17] Twitter uh and I was like I'm not I I
[61:21] don't have enough information in my
[61:23] brain to talk every day about about uh
[61:27] Bitcoin and a different topic so why
[61:29] don't I just invite people that are way
[61:32] smarter than me and I learn from them
[61:34] and let my audience also learn from them
[61:37] so like I I invite just uh people that
[61:40] are smart and have uh specific knowledge
[61:44] and try to like do every day a Bitcoin
[61:47] conversation with someone uh in the
[61:49] Bitcoin sphere which is extremely uh
[61:53] cool uh to being for me to being able to
[61:56] do that and second uh to just like learn
[61:59] from those people it's it's fascinating
[62:01] to see and that's why I'm I encourage
[62:03] everybody to follow vicked uh and as I
[62:05] encourage everybody to follow the people
[62:08] that are on my podcast video you because
[62:10] uh almost all of them I want to have a
[62:13] second time or third time or fourth time
[62:15] on and they are uh they are definitely
[62:18] worth following or even uh just follow
[62:22] uh follow them yeah um before we get uh
[62:26] to the end routine I have one small
[62:29] question for you if you still have a
[62:31] little bit of time um why did you choose
[62:34] to be anonymous why did you choose uh to
[62:37] to to stay uh viced and not like who you
[62:41] really are um it's a good question so I
[62:45] mean I just the way I see
[62:49] Bitcoin
[62:51] um evolving in the future is you know I
[62:54] believe it's going to be an extremely
[62:58] valuable money in the future like kind
[63:02] of you know we all we all joke about
[63:05] Bitcoin being worth like a million or
[63:07] even more dollars in today's dollars
[63:10] right and um I think at a certain point
[63:14] it becomes so valuable that um you could
[63:19] easily become targeted if you're if your
[63:21] name's out there and and if if you're
[63:23] associated with having been an early
[63:25] adopter of Bitcoin you know it's not
[63:28] like uh it's not a sure thing right I
[63:31] mean you can always have like good
[63:33] security practices in in real life and
[63:36] so you
[63:37] can you know I mean there's plenty of
[63:40] early adopters who their names are out
[63:42] there and they haven't been robbed yet
[63:44] and they have hundreds or thousands of
[63:47] Bitcoins so I'm sure like yeah it's it's
[63:50] possible to stay safe but I think it's
[63:52] just you know like I don't want to have
[63:54] to deal with that if I don't have to
[63:57] um so I prefer to stay Anonymous um I
[64:00] also just you know I don't I don't I
[64:01] don't want to mix my personal life with
[64:04] Bitcoin like I don't my I don't want my
[64:06] job knowing that I'm involved in Bitcoin
[64:09] very much um yeah I'd rather just kind
[64:12] of keep the two separate at least for
[64:14] now um yeah who knows who knows what
[64:18] happens in the future uh but but at
[64:20] least for now I just I think staying
[64:22] Anonymous
[64:23] is probably the best that for me at
[64:26] least I think it's also a really Noble
[64:29] thing to do uh if you think about it
[64:31] because you are contributing to uh the
[64:34] Bitcoin Community you are educating
[64:36] people and you don't really take credit
[64:38] for it like of course there is some
[64:40] account that you are owning uh and
[64:44] people like kind of associate that and
[64:45] you could switch on with like C face and
[64:47] stuff like that but uh at least to this
[64:50] day you are not taking personal credit
[64:53] uh for for the com the education that
[64:55] you're doing so like I always respect
[64:57] everybody that is uh Pony or like
[65:00] Anonymous on on the podcast I think I
[65:03] had like five six people already on uh
[65:05] that didn't show their face uh and were
[65:09] completely Anonymous here so I I highly
[65:12] respect that and I love I usually like
[65:15] enjoy it in conversation with those
[65:17] people a lot as today um we having an
[65:21] endine in the podcast where the previous
[65:23] guest is asking a question for the next
[65:25] guest without knowing who the next guest
[65:27] is so this these kind of questions are
[65:29] usually completely different than the
[65:31] rest of the podcast uh and your question
[65:34] is if you were the host of interesting
[65:37] one if you were the host of a political
[65:39] debate between the US presidential
[65:41] candidates what question would you
[65:47] ask what question would I oh man it's
[65:51] interesting who was the last
[65:54] guest enough um
[65:56] okay so yeah I don't I don't really do
[65:59] politics very much so you know I don't
[66:01] have a good sense of like what a good
[66:03] question would be to ask to be honest I
[66:05] mean I'm obviously very focused on
[66:07] bitcoin so I would probably ask him
[66:10] something about Bitcoin
[66:13] um uh maybe I'd ask them uh what they
[66:18] think about Bitcoin just straight up so
[66:20] i' want I'd want to know kind of where
[66:22] their head was at in terms of in terms
[66:23] of Bitcoin so I know that's kind of a
[66:27] that's a lame
[66:28] answer I I I would answer the same thing
[66:32] I would just want to know what they what
[66:33] they think of economicly I'm I'm if if
[66:36] in any like because this this uh I I was
[66:39] really involved in politics but now I'm
[66:41] not like the more I got involved in
[66:43] Bitcoin the more I got distanced from
[66:45] politics it's funny how it goes uh and
[66:48] for me it's like uh I would love for
[66:52] Bitcoin to be a topic somewhere around
[66:54] those elections that we all have like
[66:56] Austria has election European Union has
[66:58] an election America has an election this
[67:01] year so like uh it it I would laugh for
[67:05] bitco to be a topic but if not I don't
[67:07] care also so uh will be interesting uh
[67:10] to watch for the end uh where can people
[67:14] find it the best I mean we we already uh
[67:16] qued a little bit before uh you are on
[67:18] on on Twitter with with Wicket you're on
[67:21] YouTube I think I also saw some videos
[67:23] from from you and I will drop you your
[67:25] details in below but if one if people
[67:28] want to ask you questions if people want
[67:30] to reach out to you where's the best
[67:32] place to find you yeah definitely on
[67:35] Twitter so my handle on Twitter is
[67:39] wsor
[67:41] Bitcoin um and my my username is just
[67:44] Wicked um and then on YouTube uh my
[67:47] username is wicked smart Bitcoin so
[67:50] that's where the W and S come from my
[67:52] from my Twitter username by the way

[68:11] answers to any of your Bitcoin related
[68:13] questions uh I I try to hop on Twitter
[68:17] spaces fairly frequently so you know
[68:20] it's Al that's also a great place to ask
[68:23] questions um in a more kind of live
[68:26] setting right I think for me in
[68:28] particular like Twitter spaces is what
[68:31] ramped up my understanding of Bitcoin
[68:34] from zero to 100 in you know a matter of
[68:37] months so if you just if you find kind
[68:40] of like there's there's a few Twitter
[68:42] spaces which are pretty high signal
[68:44] right where like they're primarily
[68:45] Bitcoin focused and they don't really
[68:47] you know get off the the beaten path too
[68:51] too too much um but yeah if if you find
[68:53] those Twitter spaces and you go up on
[68:55] stage ask questions a lot of the times
[68:56] man bitcoiners are always more than
[69:00] happy to help uh get you answers or to
