[00:00] bro we are most certainly in the first
[00:01] inning and it's getting ready to explode
[00:03] $300 to $500,000 bitcoin price cbdc you
[00:06] think they're going to operate 247
[00:08] Sundays you Europeans dude you love your
[00:11] bank holidays Bitcoin is a better deal
[00:13] than owning Google Nvidia or Facebook
[00:15] I'm going to make a lot of money and
[00:17] then I'm going to reinvest this money in
[00:19] Breaking the old system down so that
[00:21] your kids and my kids and the future is
[00:23] better cleaner faster more efficient by
[00:26] 2035 we won't have a school system the
[00:28] way it looks today well I'm doing it
[00:30] because you're not willing to cuz you're
[00:31] a little baby dude you're so scared of
[00:34] your investment going bad that you won't
[00:37] stick your head out I know people with
[00:39] 10,000 Bitcoin that are absolute
[00:42] [ __ ] they're not nice people and
[00:44] they're not going to add any value to
[00:46] this future I don't want to hold on all
[00:48] this [ __ ] dude what for I don't need a
[00:49] yacht I don't need to be Mark zucky Berg
[00:52] if it's Freedom money it will be worth
[00:53] more than [ __ ] sailor put on if
[00:55] you've ever played around with Mercury
[00:56] in the science labs at school it kind of
[00:59] seeks the biggest hole in the ground
[01:01] lowest part of gravity and I think
[01:04] that's what bitcoin's going to do it's
[01:05] going to act like a apex predator that
[01:08] looks for deep deep margins the euro is
[01:11] absolutely in the middle of being
[01:13] destroyed this is a little different
[01:15] world than we were living in a year ago
[01:17] all the rules are off you think Visa is
[01:19] feeling really comfortable about the
[01:20] Federal Reserve going direct or
[01:23] government having a cbdc why the hell
[01:26] would you need visa
[01:29] [Music]
[01:31] hi Gary how you doing everything fine
[01:33] good to see you H it's it's been it's
[01:35] been a crazy I think what was it like
[01:37] half a year or something like that since
[01:39] we last recorded um what was your what
[01:41] was your some of your highlights uh
[01:43] since we last spoke I think like
[01:45] probably like last six month yeah my my
[01:48] summer uh uh I went bone fishing uh
[01:51] which is awesome if you haven't been
[01:53] bone fishing it's [ __ ] awesome I went
[01:57] um the next day I went diving with my
[02:00] daughters we we got next to a few black
[02:03] tip sharks which was pretty interesting
[02:05] not cages like Open Water it was it was
[02:09] pretty crazy uh and then just been
[02:12] working most of the most of the summer
[02:15] uh went to the Jackson Hole blockchain
[02:18] Symposium that scaramucci puts on every
[02:21] year that was outstanding Kraken put it
[02:23] on and then of course Nashville happened
[02:26] uh so yeah it's been a it's been a good
[02:28] summer how about you yeah it's I'm just
[02:31] basically in my podcast Studio making
[02:33] podcasts all my work is online I'm
[02:36] really cool um you you have been also I
[02:39] think publicly donating to to Donald
[02:41] Trump and also like you spoke with him
[02:43] in in the in the conference which is
[02:45] really cool um how is was this the spe
[02:49] the speech of Donald Trump and maybe
[02:51] also the speech of of RFK as they are
[02:54] now join forces is that did that uh kind
[02:58] of triggered now the start of of the
[03:00] nation state game theory that we are
[03:02] like a little bit waiting for like the
[03:04] first major country that has been now
[03:06] entering Bitcoin I mean El Salvador we
[03:08] had before but El Salvador is like so so
[03:11] so so small against the the the big ones
[03:15] um could that trigger like a nation
[03:16] state game theory kind of
[03:19] event well I think it already has I mean
[03:22] we saw instant reaction from both China
[03:24] and
[03:25] Russia uh free
[03:28] loosening their approach on
[03:32] crypto um and I think what happened this
[03:36] week with
[03:38] telegram uh with the CEO of telegram
[03:42] really highlights the the reason
[03:45] why Bitcoin is so important self-
[03:48] custody is
[03:50] important uh and also having the battle
[03:53] that we are most certainly going to have
[03:56] over what are rights of human beings to
[03:58] move between
[04:00] countries see see France is now showing
[04:03] us oh wow wow the whole world's changing
[04:05] now people like what's going on in
[04:07] Brazil like oh wow when did Brazil who
[04:10] is Brazil acting on behalf of that's my
[04:12] first
[04:12] question who and what were they trying
[04:15] to do
[04:16] because I don't remember a time in in
[04:20] recent history or any time that where a
[04:24] uh South American
[04:27] country grabbed starlink
[04:31] assets for a shareholder in X and
[04:36] they're penalizing shareholders and two
[04:38] different companies to censor and
[04:41] control the behavior of
[04:43] X so the game theory is already starting
[04:46] to the game theory is out of control
[04:48] right now people are politically
[04:50] responding they're financially
[04:53] responding the cbdcs are on
[04:57] steroids uh and then you
[05:00] have the cbdc world which is I think if
[05:04] you think through it very carefully I
[05:07] like the
[05:08] cbdc and the reason I like it is because
[05:11] you're pitting up the
[05:14] FED
[05:16] um with JP margan Chase I mean why do we
[05:20] need visa MasterCard JP margan Chase if
[05:23] the fed's doing everything direct with
[05:24] their own banking they just make their
[05:26] own fees let's let them go dude they're
[05:27] going to rip each other in shreds
[05:30] like the banks will hate this okay
[05:33] there's no reason for Bank of America uh
[05:35] I'm now I'm just buying cbdcs this whole
[05:39] theory of Hey I'm going to get you on
[05:40] cbdc I'm going to give you $1,000 do a
[05:42] month and you got to do all your okay so
[05:45] let's say everybody goes there but JP
[05:46] margin's going to freak out and every
[05:49] middle value player why why does anybody
[05:53] need Visa or Mastercard in that scenario
[05:55] I think you will have some of the
[05:56] largest corporations yelling foul
[05:59] because governments now trying to get
[06:01] involved with
[06:03] retail I mean you just start it starts
[06:06] the whole supply chain the way it's been
[06:09] constructed for 300 years is being
[06:12] obliterated it's it's it's showing the
[06:16] stress of all this traffic digital
[06:20] traffic on analog Legacy
[06:24] rails needing to be touched everywhere
[06:28] reports here that
[06:31] um Good Luck I I think you're trying to
[06:34] launch a a a uh I think you're trying to
[06:38] use a Fred Flintstone car a big old 400
[06:43] ton Stone car and you're laying it right
[06:46] on top of the UK M25 going okay
[06:49] compete good luck there cbdc you think
[06:52] they're going to operate
[06:53] 247 Sundays you Europeans dude you love
[06:57] your bank holidays you ain't working on
[06:59] Saturday Sundays and bank holidays it's
[07:01] not going to
[07:02] happen unless you turn everything to
[07:04] automation which gets us to the same
[07:06] point we we win this game dude we win
[07:09] this game people just have to be like
[07:12] you brought up the donation I've gotten
[07:13] a lot of heat for that I've got heat
[07:16] fart from the Bitcoin Community which I
[07:18] was really surprised by because I'm like
[07:21] hey I could have done this right
[07:22] directly to Trump dude and had and my
[07:26] family my children would have known him
[07:29] I did did this through
[07:31] Bitcoin
[07:32] specifically to send a message to the
[07:35] bitcoiners I mean I met with sailor
[07:37] right 30 minutes before that uh he's
[07:40] like hey man you know he can't do
[07:42] that he cannot do that he's a public
[07:45] company he's smart to stay out of the
[07:46] politics but a guy like me can do
[07:48] it and it got me to the table with every
[07:52] minor and some of the major players in
[07:54] the space I want to help this space
[07:57] grow so I don't I'm not interested in
[08:00] having a th000 Bitcoin Robin and never
[08:03] selling my Bitcoin I'm going to make a
[08:06] lot of money and then I'm going to
[08:08] reinvest this money in Breaking the old
[08:10] system down so that your kids and my
[08:13] kids in the future is better cleaner
[08:16] faster more efficient and that I have a
[08:19] chance of staying in the
[08:22] 1% because the truth is we can say that
[08:25] the 1% the bad deal but the bill curve
[08:29] man it's going to be a bell curve
[08:31] there's going to be a bell curve for 8
[08:33] billion people 2% of them are going to
[08:36] be on the extreme edges of both of those
[08:39] right and then there's a whole right now
[08:42] you're in the middle of that bell curve
[08:44] you're trying to get to the highest part
[08:46] of the food chain you possibly can get
[08:49] this is
[08:50] evolution it's not it's not abnormal
[08:53] this is what's abnormal is you have a
[08:56] food chain that's picking winners and
[08:58] losers and and they're stopping guys
[09:00] like you from moving your way up the
[09:02] food chain because if they clip you on
[09:04] YouTube see if you say something like I
[09:07] say they'll annihilate you right and
[09:09] that's why I'm also here because I
[09:11] actually think I'm going to get
[09:12] annihilated and you guys need to go hey
[09:14] that's un cool dude that cat was only
[09:17] here for
[09:18] Education I've taken no money from
[09:21] anyone I don't intend on taking any
[09:23] money from anyone and I'm saying this is
[09:26] a public utility YouTube
[09:30] Google Facebook I don't care dude you
[09:32] guys are utilities now this is my y'all
[09:35] through everybody in through Co you've
[09:38] betrayed every trust we could possibly
[09:40] have you're a public utility you can't
[09:43] charge Robin 33 cents for every dollar
[09:45] somebody
[09:46] sends in in in in a Super Chat that's un
[09:50] cool dude that you pay Google 33 cents
[09:52] on the dollar or 45 cents on through the
[09:56] advertise that is heinous
[09:59] that is massive dominant
[10:02] power uh an
[10:05] competitive it's not helping the market
[10:08] grow and this is a world like you cannot
[10:13] I cannot get education now like this
[10:16] without these platforms being available
[10:18] and it should be available for eight
[10:20] billion people and they should not be
[10:22] allowed to have a dominant position
[10:24] without opening all their pipes and all
[10:26] their systems and going hey look we
[10:28] don't charge any more than anybody you
[10:30] can't charge 33% when Visa is charging
[10:33] three and 3% is too much and they're
[10:36] doing nothing Okay Google's not insuring
[10:39] the money they're not banking the money
[10:41] they're not paying you any interest
[10:43] there's zero content that they provided
[10:47] simply a large Highway they've built
[10:50] over the past 20 years clearly I think
[10:54] we're getting ready to find out the
[10:56] every three-letter agency in the United
[10:58] States have been involved with them in
[11:00] the last year and none of their
[11:03] shareholders knew any of this and none
[11:05] of their users knew and when you're a
[11:07] public company and you're engaged in
[11:11] felonies I think it changes the entire
[11:13] game as to how this rolls out in the
[11:15] future you they're either going to have
[11:17] to be bifurcated into 10 different
[11:20] entities which breaking these big
[11:22] companies up has never worked well they
[11:26] all just collaborate together it becomes
[11:29] more difficult to penalize them versus
[11:32] hey you guys are going on public
[11:33] blockchain dude and you get to make this
[11:35] much and that's it and you've made
[11:38] hundreds and hundreds of billions of
[11:40] dollars in profits the game's over you
[11:42] cannot charge user rates and block
[11:47] people's communication capacity and
[11:49] their more importantly their ability to
[11:51] learn because I'm going build a school
[11:53] on this thing dude if they keep it open
[11:55] I'm going to build a school here and the
[11:58] government's going to end up giving G me
[11:59] part of the federal funding I've already
[12:01] pitched this to the
[12:02] government uh like this is the way you
[12:04] do this right um hey what's the
[12:07] federal uh budget for education in the
[12:10] United States 80 Bill a year now why
[12:15] Federal government's involved in State
[12:16] education I'm not sure but let's just we
[12:19] have this $80 billion
[12:20] number I have a couple of wealthy
[12:23] friends that are in Bitcoin um we would
[12:26] like 5% oh oh how do you grade the
[12:30] performance of the education if I can
[12:32] get a congresswoman or a senator to go
[12:35] it's an
[12:36] F then who what government official is
[12:39] going to stop me if I come in with
[12:41] Michael sailor and a couple of other
[12:43] guys and go hey uh there's a few
[12:45] billionaires here and we want 5% of the
[12:48] 80 billion that's $400 million we want
[12:52] to use that as a test case we're going
[12:54] to give you $400 million in Bitcoin to
[12:56] sit in a trust
[12:59] and we're going to be held to
[13:01] Performance
[13:02] metrics for our new school and the and
[13:06] the budget that part of the budget we
[13:08] take from you we're going to measure our
[13:09] 400 million against the other 80
[13:12] billion now first thing is really cool
[13:15] the other 80 billion has zero metrics by
[13:17] which they measure any of this so
[13:20] immediately us just even having a metric
[13:23] we win and we send a signal you cannot
[13:26] give 80 billion doll out and not have
[13:30] metrics have no way of measuring whether
[13:33] that $80 billion being spent well or not
[13:36] this is a game we can win here man I
[13:39] mean really this is if you think about
[13:41] the logic of that wow they're saying
[13:43] it's an F why would you reinvest in an
[13:47] F huh why would you reinvest in an F
[13:51] when you have a guy over here going hey
[13:53] I'll compete with all of them I'm going
[13:55] put a politician in a position where
[13:57] they they can't say no man right you
[13:59] just can't say no to that like wow
[14:00] that's a great deal who do you know that
[14:02] wouldn't do that
[14:04] deal I I think people would I think
[14:07] people would fund my
[14:10] business go I most certainly Gary will
[14:13] hold a school that will
[14:16] out uh outdo outrun in intelligence the
[14:21] results of every other school system I
[14:25] don't think anybody it's an F can't do
[14:27] worse than an f and I know all Al the
[14:29] create the the public school system in
[14:31] Austria with an F it's not it's not good
[14:34] um what do you think is is do we need a
[14:37] fundamental overhaul of the education
[14:39] system like it's it's it's it seems very
[14:42] um it doesn't serve the purpose really
[14:44] good it's it's like it it puts out uh
[14:47] good workers but not really uh any
[14:50] creative workers like it seems like it's
[14:52] it's made for like 100 years ago and not
[14:55] like for for today's world at least from
[14:57] from my understanding
[14:59] um what would you like completely overdo
[15:02] like why why even public uh education
[15:05] system if there are so many great
[15:06] contents even out there with uh with
[15:10] YouTube and all the rest I feel like we
[15:12] we don't even need them 100% maybe the
[15:16] basics with like reading and math and
[15:18] stuff like that but beyond that like we
[15:20] can learn ourselves to to a certain
[15:22] extent uh I think by 2035 we won't have
[15:26] a school system the way it looks today
[15:28] if you're sending your
[15:30] children to the school system in the
[15:32] future you you literally are just
[15:35] pushing them off into a prison I think
[15:37] we just need to understand these are not
[15:39] schools they are prisons they are
[15:43] encampments for a whole
[15:46] system that places kids into an
[15:49] encampment from 8:30 to 5: so that the
[15:53] parents don't have to deal with and it's
[15:55] not my school teachers jobs to teach my
[15:58] children
[15:59] discipline or ethics or morals I I don't
[16:03] have any interest in anyone talking to
[16:05] my children about morals or ethics or
[16:07] what they should or shouldn't believe in
[16:10] if I want to do that I'll send them to a
[16:11] counsel or a church see this is where
[16:14] schools have completely lost their way
[16:17] because they one they didn't do teaching
[16:20] very well now they're moving into
[16:21] telling people what they should and
[16:23] shouldn't think and how they should
[16:24] behave and I didn't ask for any of that
[16:27] uh but I do
[16:29] think that when you're living in this
[16:32] world and you're 30 and you have a baby
[16:35] 40 46 plus per of babies are unplanned
[16:42] for uh yeah yeah bro
[16:46] unplanned people didn't get married and
[16:48] go hey let's go produce a baby and the
[16:52] baby's mission's going to be this now
[16:54] they had a baby she gets pregnant they
[16:57] get married and then they wonder they
[16:59] don't have a plan cuz they didn't like
[17:02] actually create they didn't think oh
[17:04] we're going to manufacture a baby for
[17:06] the next 00 years and this baby's going
[17:09] to be a production member of society a
[17:11] Seedling that's going to turn into a
[17:13] Mighty Oak now there's no Mighty Oaks
[17:16] dude oh don't go out in the rain oh be
[17:20] careful like we have no Mighty Oaks
[17:22] whatsoever right I I could run a program
[17:25] for a th000 bucks a month the women
[17:27] would probably pay me to send their men
[17:30] to how to
[17:33] become a [ __ ] man how to say yes and
[17:37] no versus H let me think about
[17:42] it people can't pull the trigger anymore
[17:44] people are stunned by how quickly I came
[17:47] in this industry I'm like what are you
[17:48] talking about dude once you study
[17:52] something like why would you rethink it
[17:56] and oh let me see about pulling the
[17:57] trigger uh yeah I'll get around and
[17:59] pulling the trigger next year there
[18:02] comes a point in time when you go what
[18:04] am I going to do am I lighting this fuse
[18:06] or not it's it's really sad man um and
[18:09] and the funny thing is the women don't
[18:11] they
[18:12] don't the women ask me hey where are all
[18:15] the real men at I'm like bro I don't
[18:17] know don't ask me I ain't I don't know
[18:20] where they are I know they're not around
[18:22] you that's for sure cuz you're with me I
[18:26] mean it's it's bizarre we like I think
[18:29] there's need there needs to be like a
[18:31] reckoning this is why I think we're just
[18:33] going to have civil unrest we're going
[18:35] to have a
[18:36] war and uh because I don't think you're
[18:39] ever GNA get anybody to get off their
[18:42] couch until they have
[18:45] to Guys Like Me were born off the couch
[18:48] I like the action but it's not normal
[18:51] for most people they don't I had a man
[18:53] here last night worth a couple hundred
[18:55] million dollarars he like dude every
[18:58] time I'm driving down the road you you
[19:00] you you pop up on LinkedIn I watch one
[19:02] of your videos he's like why are you
[19:04] doing all this right and I'm like one is
[19:07] anything I'm saying not true he said no
[19:09] no it's accurate as [ __ ] he said but
[19:12] you're a Target now I'm like well I'm
[19:14] doing it because you're not willing
[19:16] to because you're a little baby dude
[19:19] you're so scared of your investment
[19:21] going
[19:23] bad that you won't stick your head out
[19:26] and I'm not going to live that way not a
[19:28] chance
[19:29] man not a chance I'm not going to go to
[19:32] my grave and somebody said oh wow he
[19:34] knew and he copped
[19:35] out it it's that's not the way heroes
[19:38] are made it's not the way a male is
[19:41] supposed to operate most certainly an
[19:43] alpha male does not operate this way
[19:46] there's a reason we have that you know
[19:48] oh alpha male that not everybody's going
[19:50] to be the alpha male man it takes a
[19:53] special kind of like little thing I I
[19:55] don't know why I have it but my brother
[19:57] has it I mean maybe we're scared to be
[20:01] something other than now that that
[20:04] doesn't mean that I always have to I
[20:05] mean if I'm with Donald Trump dude I'm I
[20:08] I don't think I'm the alpha male in that
[20:10] deal I'm certain I'm not now he's not a
[20:13] rude guy I was with him oneon-one dude
[20:15] and I felt no intimidation from him
[20:19] whatsoever that was the most fascinating
[20:22] thing two things one I was like this
[20:24] guy's 6'3 and he doesn't feel like he's
[20:26] 6'3
[20:28] I I got I'm 5 seven dud I'm a small
[20:30] little guy I've had blue blood Yale
[20:33] people look down their nose at me and
[20:35] they're literally my size but they're
[20:38] looking down their nose at me okay and I
[20:40] can feel it with Trump I was expecting
[20:43] to get that feeling that you see with
[20:45] him on TV all red in the face and just
[20:48] you know really none of that none of
[20:51] that in fact if you meet me in person I
[20:53] have a similar thing you see him on
[20:55] thing he's like oh he's aggressive but
[20:56] when I when you're around me you're like
[20:58] wow the guy really chilled out so the TV
[21:01] the camera does something to Trump I
[21:03] can't explain it but I will say he is
[21:05] massively different than he looks on TV
[21:08] and the feeling I got from
[21:11] him W was there was no intimidation no
[21:14] seniority know I'm better than you uh
[21:18] and a very clear
[21:20] Communicator he listened to us for 45
[21:22] minutes to an
[21:24] hour we told him what we wanted we told
[21:26] him what we thought the digital world
[21:28] needed did uh went through a whole list
[21:30] of things and uh he looked at everybody
[21:34] said hey if you guys get everybody to
[21:35] vote for me I'll I'll deliver I'm in I'm
[21:39] in that uh get to hold and responsible
[21:42] later hey D you said you were going to
[21:44] deliver like if he doesn't he will
[21:46] deliver because it's good for
[21:48] everybody uh most certainly he's not
[21:50] going to stop it I'm concerned about him
[21:54] doing the nfts and getting a little too
[21:56] in involved in the industry quite
[21:58] frankly
[21:59] but there would be worse things I mean I
[22:02] wouldn't do it if I was him I would
[22:04] advise hey just stick to your knitting
[22:06] but there's nothing wrong with an
[22:09] nft what's wrong with it is the way
[22:12] they've been running like I think I
[22:14] could run a token business on my own
[22:16] brand or your
[22:18] brand uh you you I don't think I don't
[22:21] know you very well but I suspect you
[22:23] don't want to have a h you don't want to
[22:25] have it in the history books that Robin
[22:26] S uh launched a token
[22:29] and you're the only one that walked away
[22:30] with any money and you're a scammer for
[22:32] the rest of your life you just don't
[22:34] seem that kind of guy dude now I could
[22:36] launch a token for I can't do it for
[22:39] node 40 but I could do it for this thing
[22:41] and I'd be I think it'd be a good
[22:43] investment for people they get to buy a
[22:45] dollar stock and card own now if I die
[22:49] okay goes to
[22:50] zero um but I think some of these
[22:54] applications are going to take hold
[22:58] and 99% of them like I know a lot of
[23:02] people that laughed at baseball
[23:04] courts and there are a few people that
[23:06] made a lot of money on baseball
[23:08] cards so doesn't make them wrong we're
[23:11] going to have to accept a lot of changes
[23:13] in the future I
[23:14] think a lot of change I mean a lot like
[23:17] it's just going to be totally different
[23:18] in 10
[23:20] years that's the other thing that that
[23:22] uh sorry for interrupting that's the
[23:24] other thing that came out of the uh
[23:26] Symposium in Wyoming
[23:29] there is no longer this attitude of hey
[23:32] uh what's this token going to be worth
[23:34] tomorrow this was we're building for the
[23:37] next eight years this project right here
[23:40] we're thinking
[23:41] 2032 I'm like whoa now this is PR okay
[23:46] this is like oh we're going to build an
[23:48] energy complex we need 800 megawatts
[23:51] over there we need 400 there and that's
[23:53] going to happen by the year
[23:55] 2035 once people start doing that dude
[23:57] this is the biggest money this planet
[23:59] has I mean these are the biggest players
[24:02] in the world I've never been more
[24:03] bullish about this last time I talked to
[24:05] you I was bullish oh my God our timing
[24:07] is perfect right now I mean really
[24:09] really perfect what do you expect uh as
[24:12] you said you bullish what do you expect
[24:13] over the I think the Bull Run is usually
[24:16] around the next like 12 to 18 months
[24:19] what do you expect for for the next uh
[24:21] couple of months maybe like 18 months
[24:24] can you bring up sailor's model sailor's
[24:27] model yeah yeah just bring up sailor
[24:28] model I'm in I'll take the love side
[24:32] yeah yeah I mean he has um he has the
[24:35] model for like uh when 2045 I think uh
[24:39] 49 million uh Bitcoin I I love that a
[24:42] lot like I think it's very realistic uh
[24:45] maybe even
[24:47] conservative uh but yeah it's it will be
[24:49] a really it will be a crazy next few
[24:52] years like the next 10 years I guess
[24:55] will be astronomical interest
[24:59] for everyone that is in the Bitcoin
[25:00] space that's why I I I don't know if you
[25:02] know that but I committed myself to
[25:04] doing this what I do right now with a
[25:07] interview birthday the next 10 years
[25:09] like there's no way I I I cannot I I
[25:12] cannot do it the next 10 years like
[25:14] there's like I can already fix it do it
[25:16] now in the first year and my resources
[25:19] get better my skills get it better I
[25:21] might can Outsource things so it's like
[25:24] uh the next 10 years will be extremely
[25:26] cool in Bitcoin and so I'm like I I will
[25:28] I will write that thing the next 10
[25:30] years maybe uh Bitcoin is so adopted in
[25:33] 10 years maybe Bitcoin is then boring
[25:35] because everyone has it I don't know um
[25:38] and there there can also be other topics
[25:41] around Freedom around building something
[25:43] like it doesn't has to be only Bitcoin
[25:45] as like right now we're also talking
[25:47] about a lot of other things but I think
[25:49] that's really cool what I also want to
[25:51] get from you is like when we talk about
[25:54] the Bitcoin
[25:55] Community um sometimes I feel like like
[25:58] uh the Bitcoin Community grew up a lot
[26:00] already but I think we can still learn a
[26:02] lot as a as a community to be brave to
[26:05] be stand up to be um walking a little
[26:08] bit more with like I feel sometimes we
[26:11] are hiding uh too much behind like our
[26:14] computer screens be behind our avatars
[26:17] and we could be a little bit more Brave
[26:19] and and and getting into things as you
[26:21] said before uh and at some point I I see
[26:25] like we are also a little bit too toxic
[26:27] against some things where like oh we
[26:29] attack each other I mean it might also
[26:31] be a good thing because it it it keeps
[26:34] our knives
[26:35] sharp it keeps it keeps in wide uh the
[26:39] mind uh sharp what do you think about
[26:41] the Bitcoin Community as you came in
[26:43] really quickly and I feel like you're
[26:45] really deep in now you're Nashville and
[26:47] you're speaker and uh you attend a lot
[26:50] of spaces I see you're really active in
[26:52] the in the community not just like
[26:54] official but you're really like deep in
[26:55] the community what's your what's your
[26:58] take on the Bitcoin community and uh
[27:00] what what would you tell bitcoiners uh I
[27:03] um somebody made a comment to me and
[27:06] they're like dude you have navigated the
[27:09] extremes of
[27:11] Bitcoin uh so well and when they said
[27:14] that I was like it has
[27:16] been a like walking you know walking a
[27:23] tight wire and walking a tight wire and
[27:27] also holding on on to one's own ethics
[27:30] and Viewpoint I mean I have attempted to
[27:33] be not massively offensive to anyone
[27:36] this is I'm coming into y'all's
[27:39] business
[27:41] and your industry I didn't create this
[27:44] industry I'm coming in I'm quite happy
[27:47] that it's here I'm not here to
[27:49] disrespect
[27:50] anyone however my investment now is of a
[27:54] level that uh I don't care if you've
[27:56] been here 15 years if you weren't smart
[27:59] enough to buy 10,000 Bitcoin at 300
[28:03] bucks and then continue buying Bitcoin
[28:07] all the way up to
[28:08] 69 don't blame me it's not my fault but
[28:12] you better say the [ __ ] out of the
[28:14] screwing the market up the people that
[28:17] came in here early
[28:19] on they have to admit you know most of
[28:23] them actually won a lottery ticket and
[28:26] uh cool but but a lottery ticket doesn't
[28:29] mean you're a business executor it
[28:32] doesn't mean you're an industrialist it
[28:34] doesn't mean you're a reformer or that
[28:36] you can restructure large Industries and
[28:39] the way most of the Puritans and
[28:42] Bitcoin contemplated peer-to-peer in the
[28:45] white paper is very different than the
[28:48] way I interpreted it um what I think
[28:54] they misunderstood and Miss sold
[28:58] was that we were going peer to peer and
[29:00] it was going to happen tomorrow morning
[29:01] and we going to have real estate with
[29:03] fungibility trading in tokens tomorrow
[29:05] morning and Bitcoin was going to be at 8
[29:08] million tomorrow morning and the entire
[29:10] Fed was going to implode the US dollar
[29:13] would cease to exist and peace and
[29:16] Sanity would spread across the world as
[29:19] if Jesus
[29:22] reappeared it's it's just not real for
[29:24] me okay Bitcoin is not going to solve
[29:27] every world problem I know people with
[29:31] 10,000 Bitcoin that are absolute
[29:34] [ __ ] they're not nice people and
[29:37] they're not going to add any value to
[29:40] this future they don't invest in
[29:44] anything uh they're holding on I will
[29:47] sell every one of my
[29:49] Bitcoin for sure and you know why
[29:53] because I actually want to help the
[29:54] world I don't want to hold on all this
[29:56] [ __ ] dude what for I I don't need a
[29:58] yacht I don't need to be Mark zucky
[30:02] Berg right who's probably going to die
[30:05] just like Steve Jobs regretting what he
[30:08] did I don't want to die with regrets man
[30:11] I want to be a I want to be a freaking
[30:14] hero I want to be somebody that's oh wow
[30:17] you know what he did a good job man he
[30:20] he wasn't a
[30:22] prostitute he wasn't like no matter how
[30:24] much money he did didn't have like I
[30:27] should be able to speak my peace and
[30:29] help the world and not be worried about
[30:31] someone taking stuff from
[30:33] me and so I think that that uh seems
[30:38] very it it has been toxic now I happen
[30:42] to believe that toxicity is already past
[30:46] its peak and we will only see
[30:48] improvement from here we will see a more
[30:52] muted message from the early players
[30:56] because their voices are just simply no
[30:58] longer going to have any Oxygen it's
[31:01] just not even going it's it's a throw a
[31:03] penny in a freaking ocean yes it did
[31:06] make a ripple but now some of the people
[31:08] will be really offended by that um
[31:12] whatever I I I'm just sharing the way I
[31:15] see this happening the wallet business
[31:18] was destroyed on January the 11th self-
[31:21] custody with
[31:22] ETF uh The Lending protocol Market
[31:25] hopefully for Bitcoin is going to
[31:28] accelerate it's in nent stage because of
[31:31] the
[31:32] ETF um but this whole hey you know you
[31:36] can't be you're not a good bitcoiner if
[31:38] you're not holding everything on a seed
[31:39] phrase in your
[31:41] backyard uh is you know really pretty
[31:46] hypocritical when you're literally
[31:48] running businesses and you call yourself
[31:50] a Bitcoin only guy and you're actually
[31:52] running businesses that has nothing to
[31:54] do with
[31:56] decentralization it's you know one
[31:58] [ __ ] affiliate trade behind another
[32:02] and it's like you guys are no different
[32:04] than any of the other scammers so
[32:06] there's there's a lot of hypocrisy
[32:07] that's going on in this
[32:09] industry um I'm stunned that we're $1
[32:12] trillion dollar with the behavior and
[32:16] actually very bullish I was like woo you
[32:18] got to a trillion dollars with all this
[32:21] stuff going
[32:22] on I'm pretty sure1 trillion doll did
[32:26] six years
[32:28] it 10xs Bitcoin 10xs in six years 10
[32:31] trilli it will absolutely be8 to 12
[32:34] trillion do
[32:35] size um it makes so much sense to me
[32:38] that it would take
[32:40] up assume it's a $800 trillion Market 10
[32:46] trillion nothing man it's 8% of the
[32:49] market right now we're sub
[32:53] one sub one
[32:55] 2516 billionaires see this is my math I
[32:59] do all these power law guys and models
[33:01] Giovani my I I listen to every one of
[33:04] them I like them all I think they're
[33:05] lovely people everybody wants to be
[33:08] right you know you go through this part
[33:10] of your life where you want to be right
[33:11] I just want to be rich and happy uh
[33:14] happy and Rich by the way I do it in
[33:15] that order uh I have no interest in
[33:17] being right or
[33:19] first um but you see you see some of
[33:22] these people looking at this Market
[33:25] when caner Fitzgerald shows up most
[33:28] people never have heard of caner Gerald
[33:31] Howard lutnick and he's sitting in a
[33:32] room with his son and Trump's in the
[33:34] room and we're talking about
[33:38] Bitcoin uh bro we are most certainly in
[33:41] the first inning and it's getting ready
[33:42] to explode caner Fitzgerald is a beast
[33:46] Howard lutnick is one of the great
[33:48] commercial champions of the planet uh I
[33:52] know these guys cuz they helped me in
[33:53] the energy patch back in the day and
[33:56] they were I mean I walked up to him went
[33:58] Howard what the hell are you doing here
[34:01] and he's like dude this is so much like
[34:03] n gas and electricity it's unbelievable
[34:06] I'm like exactly it's exactly like it so
[34:09] because we've been here before we've
[34:11] seen these industries remember n gas and
[34:13] a power trade on 30 minute markets man
[34:17] that used to be 30y year
[34:19] markets there's no credit lines there's
[34:22] nothing there's just it's just a
[34:24] commodity Market Exxon Mobile's treated
[34:26] the same as me or you or we're all duut
[34:29] shell and that is cool that now in the
[34:33] in the crypto industry you're like oh
[34:34] the miners they're already
[34:36] 42% like oh they have too much
[34:38] consolidation you're always going to
[34:40] have consolidation in mining and
[34:41] production and farming because the
[34:43] margins [ __ ] the margins are crap in
[34:47] that and growing things this is why
[34:49] sailor will not sailor doesn't ever buy
[34:52] mining companies I look at the mining
[34:54] business why would you want to own that
[34:57] when I can buy a Bitcoin for 60
[35:00] Grand it it makes no sense to me uh
[35:03] there'll be a day maybe
[35:06] okay and I say maybe there'll be a day
[35:08] but not I I just don't need to it does
[35:11] not need to be this complicated but I
[35:14] most certainly think we get to 10 Trill
[35:16] if you watch or listen to my podcast on
[35:18] a regular basis I guess you already
[35:20] bought some Bitcoin and now the most

[37:06] time pieces those watches are amazing I
[37:08] love them so much it was really hard for
[37:10] me to pick the one that I want to have
[37:12] because there are lot of great options I
[37:15] went with the new transparency Edition
[37:18] they're all limited so grab yours those
[37:21] will not be available for a long time
[37:23] but there will come new models and new
[37:26] amazing designs along the way it's
[37:28] interesting when we talk about um there
[37:31] is this underlying of Sailor model uh is
[37:36] the work of um Jesse Myers of of crosses
[37:39] like he's also always mentioned in in
[37:42] Michael sailor's presentations and I had
[37:45] him really short time like like one or
[37:47] two weeks ago I had him on uh and he
[37:50] basically has the thing of like oh
[37:52] there's 900 trillion doar worth of
[37:55] assets uh and then we have to figure out
[37:57] what's the percentage that Bitcoin will
[38:00] capture of that and it's a question in
[38:03] my mind where I cannot wrap my head
[38:05] around it and we we we can get from like
[38:08] conservatively oh it will be like 20 10
[38:10] to 20% of the world's assets then there
[38:14] are the people that's saying look
[38:15] Bitcoin is money money is 50% of
[38:17] everything so 50% of the asset will be
[38:20] Bitcoin then there are crazy people that
[38:22] saying like oh Bitcoin will be 99% of
[38:25] everything uh uh which are have a hard
[38:28] time seeing that but uh I'm open to
[38:30] everything how what like not putting a
[38:34] time stamp on that because I think the
[38:35] time is really hard to to guess uh when
[38:38] it will happen but what do you think the
[38:41] full potential of of Bitcoin is well
[38:44] like how much of percentage of the net
[38:47] Assets in the world uh can can Bitcoin
[38:50] capture and why well let's assume
[38:52] there's $800 trillion worth
[38:55] assets I think this is a number that's
[38:58] who knows what it is really see that's
[39:00] one of the problems but 800 trillion
[39:03] would be absolutely the
[39:06] minimum uh for something that's taken up
[39:09] 15 years and had no regulatory Clarity a
[39:12] bunch of idiots LSD droppers uh running
[39:17] the program monster amount of
[39:20] tribes tons of scams and crimes and it's
[39:24] still at a trillion for it to 10x from
[39:26] here with Howard lck being here and JP
[39:29] margan Chase and Fidelity Fidelity is
[39:32] just like getting ready to
[39:34] rock Black Rock black Rock's been here
[39:37] four and a half five years you have uh
[39:40] God I always forget this lady's name um
[39:44] big Bank old bank that's been in the
[39:47] space 12 years nobody heard of no clue
[39:52] they've been working on this City's giv
[39:54] like massive amounts of money on the
[39:56] underly Penning of some of these
[39:59] debt instruments that sailor and others
[40:02] are
[40:03] buying uh 10 trillion in six years two
[40:06] years after Trump I I think that's
[40:08] doable dude and that's a what is that
[40:12] that's a half 300 to $500,000 bitcoin
[40:15] price I
[40:17] think um that's not the entire goal
[40:21] Market but I don't think the whole goal
[40:23] Market is a money is a value market
[40:25] anyway I think some of it's jewelry
[40:27] uh doesn't even include the silver
[40:29] market we we've already exceeded silver
[40:33] also um I think we have to get through
[40:36] these comp the Bitcoin is a better deal
[40:38] than owning Google Nvidia or Facebook
[40:41] Google Nidia or Facebook's 10 trillion
[40:44] is has no antitrust issues all three of
[40:47] those companies are massive massive
[40:50] massive massive antitrust exposure they
[40:53] have an address they have a CEO one of
[40:55] the CEOs of those three companies just
[40:57] admitted they committed
[40:59] felonies felonies okay like I know
[41:02] nobody wants to say the word but like I
[41:05] am shocked that his board allowed him to
[41:08] do that that was a long conversation I
[41:11] guaranteed it that means that someone
[41:13] sent him a letter and said we're getting
[41:15] ready to release a document on you and
[41:17] he's like ah I need to get in front of
[41:19] it or he thinks Trump's going to be
[41:22] elected without a doubt and he doesn't
[41:25] want to find himself in piggy in middle
[41:27] over
[41:28] there because there is [ __ ] going to hit
[41:31] the fan this is why I say we will not
[41:32] have an election and Trump won't make it
[41:35] because I don't think the guys with all
[41:38] the skeletons they've been packing in
[41:41] these closets for eight years I mean I
[41:45] don't think that anyone's going to
[41:48] believe that Trump isn't gonna like
[41:50] pushing push an
[41:52] investigation who shot me who shot
[41:55] Kennedy who shot the other Kennedy who
[41:57] shot shot Martin Luther King let's go
[41:58] ahead and reveal all that he has to
[42:00] release that now no I will not stand for
[42:03] that hey dude you were almost shot dude
[42:06] I'm not giving you any more money if I
[42:08] think you're G to get shot again let's
[42:10] find out who did all this [ __ ] okay like
[42:14] release it like stop it it's been almost
[42:17] 80 years 70 years right so I think we
[42:21] all have a right to know what the hell
[42:22] is going on who's been running this
[42:24] country since I've been 6 years old man
[42:27] they've been killing people killing
[42:30] Visionaries right so I'm stunned that
[42:33] more people aren't talking about this
[42:35] this just happened six weeks ago and
[42:37] even the look on your face you're like
[42:39] man this was supposed to be a Bitcoin
[42:40] conversation you know this is hard to
[42:43] well I know it is but you know what it
[42:45] just happened dude and we are literally
[42:48] not talking about it two massive
[42:52] pipelines were blown up two and a half
[42:54] years ago no one's talking about it
[42:58] we have an immigration issue all over
[43:00] the world that's out of control zero
[43:03] zero attempt to assimilate anyone no
[43:06] one's talking about it so I don't know
[43:10] what Bitcoin could be worth dude if it's
[43:12] Freedom money it will be worth more than
[43:14] [ __ ] sailor put on it in what time
[43:16] period who
[43:17] knows uh I don't know I know for sure we
[43:20] have never seen a product like
[43:23] this like like the most compelling thing
[43:25] I could ever
[43:27] ask anyone is have you ever seen
[43:30] anything truly finite I would just like
[43:34] ask anyone that's listening this close
[43:35] your eyes and say have I ever
[43:38] seen anything that's finite a grain of
[43:41] sand a
[43:43] star a pencil a job money is there
[43:48] anything and I don't think human beings
[43:50] have ever confronted finite and
[43:55] therefore if they have not confronted
[43:56] finite all they think of is an infinite
[44:01] Universe of everything that like there
[44:04] just everything everything all the
[44:06] time and that's just not true okay
[44:08] that's that's inflationary that's such
[44:10] an inflationary
[44:12] Viewpoint um value and money or value
[44:17] and numbers are totally different and I
[44:19] think we have a Humanity that is gotten
[44:21] used to trying to price
[44:24] everything right place a dollar value on
[44:27] it versus just value like I value you as
[44:30] a human being I think you're one of the
[44:33] nicer people I have met in a while right
[44:39] and I'm like okay I stick you up in a
[44:41] little box on a shelf somewhere hey I
[44:43] think Robin's legit now if I do some
[44:47] research maybe I put you too high up on
[44:49] the Shelf maybe I oh he's involved with
[44:51] a bad person or get involved with the
[44:54] wrong chick dude you can easily come
[44:55] down follow down the list
[44:58] I mean really this is why I tell
[44:59] Founders and investors I'm like hey
[45:01] those are bright guys dude but they're
[45:04] 24 I was with a guy the other night 70
[45:06] year old guy he's like this is a great
[45:08] investment I said yeah it is dude but
[45:10] your CEO's 24 your CTO is 26 and the the
[45:15] chief marketing guy's 30 and he's full
[45:16] of [ __ ] I said none of these guys have
[45:19] girls and like the moment they run into
[45:22] a redhe head that's on [ __ ] drugs
[45:24] dude that they happen to dig all all
[45:27] their genius goes to [ __ ] in hand basket
[45:29] and he's like that's so true man that's
[45:31] I said that's why you need some older
[45:32] guys
[45:34] around right um so the cool thing about
[45:37] Bitcoin is even if you don't think about
[45:39] the value let's say it stays at a
[45:42] trillion what else has happened around
[45:45] us because if that's true the dollar
[45:48] isn't worth
[45:49] anything and I don't think that's true I
[45:51] think the dollar is going to maintain a
[45:53] very strong position on this planet for
[45:55] 10 years
[45:57] um everything else might suffer I mean
[45:59] there's absolutely the euro is
[46:01] absolutely in the
[46:03] middle of being destroyed the UK pound
[46:07] sterling might hang in there just
[46:09] because if they lose the pound sterling
[46:11] they've lost their entire
[46:13] country that that island is
[46:16] done and they're doing everything they
[46:18] can to turn that into a rat Center I
[46:20] mean just a prison prison Island it's
[46:23] Freedom money dude like I you know it's
[46:26] exactly what all the people talk about
[46:27] in Bitcoin it's like hey stop
[46:29] controlling where I can go I mean people
[46:32] are waking up today going hey what
[46:33] happens if uh they decide that my
[46:36] passport is not valid I thought I could
[46:38] travel freely I thought with a blue
[46:42] passport I didn't have to worry about
[46:44] what I said in about France when I land
[46:47] in France does that mean that I get held
[46:50] in France now whoa this is a little
[46:53] different world than we were living in a
[46:54] year ago I think all the all the rules
[46:57] are off all the rules are off and and I
[47:00] don't see them stopping this Behavior it
[47:02] seems like it's going to go critical and
[47:05] that's why you I really encourage people
[47:07] like you to do what you're doing is
[47:09] there is there a fight on on freedom and
[47:12] privacy and and all those things like we
[47:14] talk about something truly finite maybe
[47:17] freedom is is a really finite resource
[47:20] right now um it's also interesting I
[47:22] think last time we we really spoke about
[47:25] freedom on on an individual level uh and
[47:28] I think it's a really interesting and
[47:30] very important conversation how to
[47:32] protect that freedom uh protected
[47:34] Freedom uh for yourself with maybe a BL
[47:38] B citizenship with uh solid skills and
[47:42] uh and and building businesses and
[47:44] having also money that that is
[47:47] permissionless as Bitcoin um H how do
[47:50] you go ahead and and if if like someone
[47:52] young or like whoever how however old he
[47:55] is how do you protect protect uh
[47:57] yourself against all those things like
[48:00] if a telegram CEO is is held by friend
[48:02] like that like he's he's not a stupid
[48:04] guy like he's he's bright and he's is
[48:07] really good like how how do we protect
[48:09] each other from from that happening and
[48:11] on an individual level I think we have
[48:13] to uh
[48:15] hope that Twitter Rumble and these other
[48:19] social network platforms these
[48:21] centralized platforms continue allow us
[48:25] to use our decentral Iz tools your
[48:28] computer this software this microphone
[48:31] everyone please go to the use Market buy
[48:35] a
[48:36] microphone most cameras most phone uh
[48:40] phones and computers have cameras in
[48:42] them plug them in and start talking
[48:46] about what you know to talk about we
[48:48] cannot possibly have enough people like
[48:50] Robin doing this I don't care if you're
[48:52] talking about
[48:53] sewing uh how to take care of yourself
[48:57] Heth mental health dude there's a
[48:59] million things people need help with
[49:01] there's a million things I need help
[49:03] with okay Saturday afternoons I run a
[49:06] show talking about IQ and the ability to
[49:09] pull the trigger I don't talk about
[49:12] Bitcoin okay bitcoin's not the only
[49:15] thing to talk about here there's so many
[49:17] cool There's Sunday religions okay like
[49:20] open a damn Church man I don't have one
[49:23] church I can go to that I really like CU
[49:26] they all in to betray me uh open a
[49:29] church open a school for thinking open a
[49:32] school for reading read a book to I
[49:35] don't care the more people we have doing
[49:37] this they can't stop us all okay this is
[49:40] really threatening to a centralized
[49:43] Authority who's been used to running
[49:45] everything and I don't need the
[49:47] centralized Authority I don't need to
[49:49] pay for them if I do pay for a
[49:51] centralized
[49:53] Authority I'd like them to be able to
[49:56] act
[49:57] as they're
[49:58] centralized act as if they're a hub and
[50:03] they can't just change the rules on
[50:05] everyone right and if it's a public
[50:08] company then make it behave like a
[50:10] public company which is
[50:13] transparency okay I have no interest in
[50:16] sitting on S on a platform unless I know
[50:20] oh wow you guys are actually
[50:22] coordinating with the FBI the CIA the
[50:24] IRS the DEA and essay and what about the
[50:28] French intelligence or the Jewish intell
[50:30] oh I didn't realize
[50:31] that can I have my money back please and
[50:35] all my data I didn't know you guys were
[50:37] doing all this no one told me that it's
[50:41] a different game man when you're public
[50:43] company you can't do this [ __ ] so we
[50:45] need people to stand up I think you need
[50:47] you need to be a little angry quite
[50:49] frankly on what's going on this is not
[50:52] going to
[50:54] improve okay it never improves when
[50:56] you're dealing with
[50:57] Psychopaths they don't stop okay they
[51:00] will literally eat themselves before
[51:02] they stop so let's let them eat
[51:05] themselves and that means we have you
[51:08] you can only put one French CEO in jail
[51:12] in a French jail one at a time you can't
[51:15] do 500 of us man that's why it's so
[51:18] important to to step up here you know
[51:21] I'm going to say that freedom has been a
[51:23] little too cheap for us since you've
[51:24] been born no no one's paid anything for
[51:27] Freedom the first time you have ever
[51:30] heard hey freedom is not free was when
[51:32] you met me wow you're 30 years old you
[51:35] never heard that right but it's true as
[51:37] soon as you said it you're like whoa
[51:38] that's for sure D it might be free for
[51:40] 10 years it might be free for 40 years
[51:43] you might not pay anything for it until
[51:45] that [ __ ] one moment man oops I paid
[51:49] so little in the last 30 years is really
[51:52] expensive now I just got thrown in
[51:54] jail I I I have I have the legal system
[51:58] is so outrageous today that I have a
[52:03] California law firm who has one human
[52:06] being signed a document and they keep at
[52:09] they're filing class action Rico filings
[52:12] against for something that happened
[52:14] seven eight years
[52:16] ago and I've never even dealt with a
[52:19] consumer how do you have a class action
[52:22] if you've never dealt with a consumer
[52:24] but because the current Administration
[52:26] is so litigious they're litigious on
[52:29] those they want to bother they're using
[52:32] regulation as an enforcement whip while
[52:35] they're not even noticing
[52:37] FTX not even noticing the Celsius
[52:40] [ __ ] right and I'm like hey maybe
[52:43] you guys don't have enough people or
[52:45] maybe you're focused on the wrong
[52:47] targets but when you can have lawyers
[52:50] filing lawsuits and then asking people
[52:54] excuse me uh Mr Cordon uh are you a
[52:57] large Bitcoin holder and this incident
[53:01] doesn't have anything to do with
[53:03] Bitcoin nothing has something to do with
[53:05] the credit card industry right uh Mr
[53:08] Cardone are you a large donor to the
[53:10] Trum
[53:11] Administration first two questions in a
[53:14] deposition wasting my $2,000 an hour in
[53:17] legal fees how they even asked these
[53:20] questions man it has nothing to do with
[53:21] that case it'd be like hey what's your
[53:24] religion
[53:26] okay I've had lawyers look at me and go
[53:28] eight years ago six years ago don't do
[53:31] not mention Bitcoin
[53:34] why don't do again don't and don't be
[53:37] naive this is an
[53:39] xfc lawyer who now works in the private
[53:43] sector and he she's looking at me going
[53:45] I'm like hey I heard you because I
[53:47] thought you knew the inside Intel she
[53:48] said I do know the inside baseball don't
[53:51] talk to them about Bitcoin they will
[53:53] [ __ ] discriminate against you wow
[53:56] really
[53:58] whoa seriously oh and if you talk about
[54:01] Trump they're going to [ __ ] you bro this
[54:03] is the world we live in today so I'm
[54:06] just trying to I had a man last night
[54:08] asked me why I'm being so transparent
[54:10] with everyone because if it can happen
[54:12] to me dude it can happen to you they
[54:15] tried to shoot Trump and the telegram
[54:17] CEO who's worth billions of dollars
[54:19] sitting in [ __ ] France can't leave
[54:22] after being invited to France for dinner
[54:23] by the president so if you don't think
[54:26] this world is set up to grind your
[54:29] little people down into nothing
[54:31] guarantee that's where we're headed if
[54:33] we don't
[54:34] fight and all we're doing is fighting
[54:36] all we're doing is what your mom did
[54:38] stand up for
[54:40] yourself nobody said Mommy a good mommy
[54:43] never said oh wait for Camala Harris or
[54:46] the UK government to stand up for you a
[54:49] good mother never told you that stand up
[54:52] for your own damn self you have blood in
[54:55] your vein
[54:57] your parents gave it to you at some
[54:59] point in their lineage lineage they had
[55:02] to fight for their freedom and you have
[55:04] never one day had a fight for your
[55:07] freedom it just might be time this might
[55:10] be um might maybe the the time comes
[55:14] when like really cbdcs come out like you
[55:17] said mentioned in the beginning you you
[55:20] you think like they are really
[55:21] steamrolling ahead I mean I'm I'm
[55:23] sitting in the EU and I'm a little bit
[55:25] uh jealous of of of of America because
[55:28] they're like they have a way more
[55:29] skeptic approach to to the cbdcs and the
[55:32] EU they're really like pushing the
[55:34] digital Euro which is the cbdc um really
[55:38] had is is that like is do we have now
[55:41] that choice of like complete dystopia
[55:43] and then this this cbdc route or like
[55:45] this this Freedom mind and this this
[55:47] Bitcoin route I I feel like cbdc could
[55:51] be really damaging to to to our freedom
[55:53] and we have to F it's also to to
[55:56] fighting is also really interesting um
[55:59] one more thing that I want to mention I
[56:00] see like someone asked me today in in a
[56:03] podcast where I was the guest yeah he
[56:06] said to me like uh do you think we we
[56:08] can have a war because of Bitcoin and I
[56:10] was like there might be but we are
[56:13] already in a war like we are in a in an
[56:15] information Warfare already like the
[56:17] content creators the Educators as
[56:19] yourself we are like soldiers trying to
[56:22] get the the the orange light the orange
[56:25] hair of trump and the orange light of
[56:27] Bitcoin out there and it's really
[56:31] important to to do that um do you see
[56:34] cbdcs as a as a threat and how should we
[56:38] how should we fight against that well I
[56:41] think if you have aund there's 108
[56:44] countries as I know uh working on
[56:47] cbdc so we have 108 guys that are can
[56:49] compete with each
[56:51] other that's good I dig it I love
[56:55] competition
[56:57] so all you need is two or three of them
[56:58] to break ranks um this is the problem
[57:00] with an oligopoly all you need is two or
[57:02] three of them to break ranks they have
[57:04] more pressure than like by the way Mark
[57:07] Zuckerberg pointing fingers to the B and
[57:10] saying hey you guys made me do this that
[57:12] is breaking serious ranks so if you
[57:14] don't think that this is why I brought
[57:16] the cbdc up you think Vis is feeling
[57:19] really comfortable about the Federal
[57:22] Reserve going direct or a government
[57:25] having a CBD see why the hell would you
[57:27] need visa why Visa stock price should
[57:31] get
[57:32] crushed the moment the FED goes direct
[57:36] they don't need any of these middlemen
[57:38] FIS World pay ferve all these vendors in
[57:42] the middle that look like Banks we have
[57:45] literally been calling them Banks not
[57:46] Banks Visa is not a
[57:48] Bank visa is a freaking duopoly that
[57:52] controls 76% of all the credit card
[57:55] processing in the United States and
[57:58] Europe has massive leakage 133% leakage
[58:02] declines 600 million chargeback disputes
[58:06] s trillion dollars in fees in the United
[58:08] States from fees and fines little tiny
[58:11] little massive inefficient 62,000 people
[58:15] between the United States and I pitched
[58:17] this to MasterCard once said you know
[58:19] there's 62,000 dispute managers people
[58:23] that file disputes and handle chargeback
[58:25] claims across all of Europe and America
[58:28] 62,000 that's 6
[58:31] billion in overhead every year 60
[58:34] billion in 10 years who's paying for
[58:37] that you're paying for it bro you're
[58:40] paying for Barkley's issuing to file
[58:43] charge backs against Barkley's Merchant
[58:45] acquiring
[58:47] business two divisions two different
[58:50] people two different pnls one gets a
[58:53] bonus probably they both get bonuses
[58:55] that is vastly inefficient okay 62,000
[59:00] people and all of them are
[59:03] amateurs not one of them have overall
[59:09] view into the entire chargeback scheme
[59:12] including Visa Mastercard they only see
[59:14] their own little
[59:15] problem so none of those companies
[59:18] should be involved they have way too
[59:19] much bias they have a p&l protect this
[59:23] is why this problem never gets better
[59:25] Visa mord have invested close to $5
[59:28] billion in fraud firms in the last 10
[59:31] years fraud has done this dude Okay
[59:35] Internet Internet growth has done this
[59:38] uh fraud as they claim it has literally
[59:43] outstripped the kager of Internet growth
[59:47] and the and the Investments made by
[59:50] MasterCard and Visa in fraud solutions
[59:53] that tells me oh wow you guys aren't
[59:55] investing in fraud frud Solutions you're
[59:57] investing in fraud fee structures you're
[60:01] generating income streams go find go try
[60:03] to find out from visa and mcard how much
[60:05] money they made from fees and fines last
[60:07] year can't find it dude it's in the
[60:09] billions and you cannot find it it's in
[60:12] public companies you cannot find that
[60:14] data you cannot even find how much
[60:16] destruction there is in the credit card
[60:18] industry the 600 million chargebacks
[60:20] can't find that data that tells me
[60:22] there's obscurity somewhere and every
[60:24] time there is OB security or there's
[60:27] blackouts or you can't find data someone
[60:31] is making money when they should not be
[60:34] and that's the cool thing about crypto I
[60:36] think I think Bitcoin is just going to
[60:38] be this like this
[60:40] Mercury you know if you've ever played
[60:42] around with Mercury in the science labs
[60:44] at school it kind of seeks the biggest
[60:47] hole in the ground uh the lowest part of
[60:50] gravity and I think that's what
[60:52] bitcoin's going to do it's going to it
[60:55] it's act like a apex predator that looks
[60:58] for deep deep margins like 800 basis
[61:02] points on a digital transaction or 800
[61:06] basis points that's 8% by the way on a
[61:10] gambling transaction or buying a game or
[61:14] oh this Google
[61:15] thing taking a hundred bucks for every
[61:18] 300 you get uh that's GNA get don't send
[61:22] me money on Google I've told everyone
[61:24] don't send it to me
[61:26] here's my cash app here's my BC wallet
[61:29] here's my eth wallet do not give Google
[61:33] any money we must start realizing that
[61:36] we have been funding the enemy the best
[61:39] thing everybody on listening to this can
[61:41] do is go through your list of stuff in
[61:45] your checking account in your bank and
[61:47] ask yourself next to each one is this an
[61:49] enemy is this an enemy is this an enemy
[61:53] oh look at this guy o I don't I'm not
[61:55] going to do business with Costco anymore
[61:58] Costco asked me to put a mask on very
[62:00] rudely stand in line six feet away from
[62:02] the next guy and my membership card no
[62:05] longer gave me Priority I had to do I
[62:08] had to jump through all these hoops [ __ ]
[62:10] you Costco okay that's that's $1,200 a
[62:13] month every month for 10 years that's 12
[62:16] Grand a year dude that's $120,000 from
[62:19] one player I have never ever stepped
[62:22] foot in Costco will never ever step foot
[62:25] in Costco who benefited from Co [ __ ]
[62:30] Costco okay okay so so anybody that was
[62:34] slamming me into a position oh AMC I
[62:36] Gotta Wear a a mask go watch a movie
[62:39] [ __ ] off no chance dud oh Netflix you
[62:42] promoted this stuff oh you Facebook
[62:45] promoted this I'm
[62:47] out
[62:49] disconnect no more payments uh Taco Bell
[62:53] you you behaved us I'm out dude okay I'm
[62:56] done uh like I I'll spend money with you
[62:59] if people looked at the amount of money
[63:02] they're spending with their enemy and
[63:03] realize the amount of money you don't
[63:05] support the people that actually are
[63:07] helpful it's two cents it's literally
[63:10] two cents right so just because it's
[63:13] convenient to pay these people doesn't
[63:16] make it right that's that's an
[63:18] interesting like because I think we uh
[63:21] end up
[63:23] like supporting a lot of things that we
[63:26] actually are
[63:28] against when when we look at the the
[63:30] hard facts because like yeah you look
[63:33] that you look that I mean with like
[63:35] supermarkets and stuff like that it's
[63:37] really hard because for example in the
[63:39] co era like all the supermarkets in
[63:41] Austria play this game so it's it's like
[63:44] where do I get my my Supermarket stuff I
[63:47] basically have to uh support one of them
[63:51] uh can maybe search for like who was the
[63:53] the the best player out of out of nor uh
[63:57] but it's it's interesting I feel like we
[64:00] are in an important time where we we
[64:02] have to fight um one thing that I I want
[64:05] to get in because you said in the in the
[64:07] beginning the the the OG's kind of want
[64:10] a lottery ticket and I see it also like
[64:12] that and uh when when you have now
[64:16] people getting in Bitcoin and we see the
[64:18] things that might come in the next years
[64:21] we we we maybe have also people that win
[64:24] lotteries with Bitcoin in in the future
[64:26] they just like a they're in because
[64:28] someone told them they forgot about it
[64:29] 10 years later they find out about it um
[64:32] what what do you have as as tips for I
[64:36] those who already have won the lottery
[64:38] but did not really like work towards it
[64:41] but they like invested forgot the wallet
[64:43] then found it again and all of the
[64:45] sudden they are millionaires or maybe
[64:47] even more than that um maybe those who
[64:50] are in generated like what ADV wasse as
[64:53] someone who worked uh towards uh that
[64:56] that uh net worth what advice do we have
[64:58] for those people that all of the sudden
[65:00] got rich because of of Bitcoin well if
[65:03] you want a lottery I think uh
[65:05] acknowledging that you won the lottery
[65:08] is really good and if you don't know if
[65:11] you won the lottery I'm happy to have a
[65:12] conversation with you I know enough of
[65:14] these guys now that have been around 12
[65:17] and 15 years I'm no longer a threat to
[65:19] anyone here I think people have think
[65:21] hey this guy's like you know he's
[65:24] putting real money one you can't say I'm
[65:26] not a small player anymore but I'm also
[65:29] like building companies in the space um
[65:33] so it's just not going to hold water
[65:34] every Industries I've ever been in I
[65:36] have actually made more contributions
[65:38] than I've taken and I'm pretty sure
[65:41] that's going to be the future this point
[65:44] that we were just making which was
[65:48] fighting back that your freedom like
[65:51] you're looking at this going hey I would
[65:53] really be much more comfortable in
[65:54] Florida than I am in
[65:56] Austria that's what I heard you just say
[65:59] I I agree with you dude uh one of the
[66:01] things that I would do is I would start
[66:03] investigating
[66:06] Hydroponics and
[66:08] other uh ways to grow your own food with
[66:12] the community around you doing this
[66:15] single-handedly is not really that good
[66:18] it's not scalable so but doing it in
[66:20] villages is really cool and they're
[66:22] going to have a hard time stopping a
[66:24] plant you know a PL
[66:26] ation um food growing if it's a group of
[66:30] people now they could come in and find
[66:32] you and find one little one roach in
[66:34] your kitchen and go oh that's violation
[66:36] of code 37 Part B if you won the lottery
[66:40] though a agree that it was a lottery
[66:43] ticket you won just because you made a
[66:46] bunch of money one time does not mean
[66:48] that you can make it twice most people
[66:50] cannot make it twice the odds of being a
[66:53] great entrepreneur are less than in
[66:56] being me being an NBA basketball player
[66:59] at
[67:00] 66 5'7 155 lbs there's no chance of me
[67:04] being a basketball player the truth is
[67:06] it would be easier for me to be a
[67:08] basketball player than an entrepreneur a
[67:10] successful
[67:11] entrepreneur it's okay if you want a lot
[67:13] of ticket but don't confuse yourself
[67:15] with being a genius I can't tell you how
[67:18] many people
[67:19] made $300 million in Bitcoin sold it at
[67:24] 7,000
[67:26] then decided they were going to build a
[67:29] wallet they were going to go peer to
[67:31] perer in South Africa and generate
[67:33] trillions of dollars and they're still
[67:35] working on that
[67:37] project while it's taking more and more
[67:39] money because they don't know anything
[67:41] about building a business man these
[67:43] businesses like my node 40 business it
[67:45] takes Millions to get it into a position
[67:47] where okay now we're going to rock and
[67:50] roll bitcoin's gone from 3,000 to 60,000
[67:53] they just lost a 20x while their private
[67:56] Equity company their idea went to [ __ ]
[67:59] and they don't can't even monetize
[68:01] anything so one if you made a bunch of
[68:03] money from one area don't start thinking
[68:05] about I need to go do something else
[68:07] that is
[68:09] ridiculous stay where you made the money
[68:12] like why would you do that especially
[68:14] you don't have any
[68:15] skills and just because you have a bunch
[68:18] of money and somebody comes to you and
[68:20] go hey can you invest in my little thing
[68:22] doesn't make it a good investment I
[68:24] never invested with friends okay I
[68:27] invest with high quality players who
[68:30] have a scalable idea uh so if you're
[68:34] really dude I would find some advisors
[68:36] okay like I would find some people that
[68:39] okay you're going to pay them to give
[68:40] you some really cool information and not
[68:43] [ __ ] it up I mean I have a couple of
[68:45] people that call me and they're like
[68:46] they show me the wallets dude they don't
[68:48] know what to do with it it's so much
[68:51] money they have no idea what to do with
[68:54] it and and many of them sadly for them
[68:58] broke so many common rules that they're
[69:01] scared to introduce it to
[69:03] anyone they sitting on $600 million dude
[69:06] and they're like uh I need a lawyer but
[69:09] I really don't need a lawyer because I
[69:11] did some [ __ ] that's really bad I
[69:13] haven't paid any taxes and they're in
[69:15] this weird
[69:17] box so because they underestimated the
[69:23] opportunity and you Michael S and I are
[69:26] not going to end up in trouble over this
[69:29] trade now we may
[69:30] be uh I may be handled but for something
[69:33] but over this
[69:35] thing uh pretty sure that the guys that
[69:38] are coming in today we're not violating
[69:39] any rules D we're we're paying our taxes
[69:43] we understand the tax rules and code and
[69:47] we never went into this thing going hey
[69:49] this is an anonymous product and I don't
[69:51] ever have to pay Capital Gains which
[69:54] less than 1 million people have paid
[69:56] capital gains on crypto out of the 52
[69:59] million you want to know why the
[70:01] government's pissed off less than one
[70:03] million people in the United States pay
[70:06] taxes out of the 52 million that check
[70:09] the box it's it's it's it's like hey
[70:12] that's [ __ ] so and they're going to
[70:15] come after you guess what they're going
[70:16] to come after you not tax evasion fraud
[70:19] criminal
[70:20] fraud they're going to come hard
[70:23] man uh
[70:26] so I would clean up your act find some
[70:28] really good advisor spend money on legal
[70:31] things get a piece of software called
[70:34] node 40 it's a company I own roughly
[70:37] half of but node 40 people do not
[70:40] understand this when you get a letter
[70:42] from these agencies I don't care what
[70:43] country you're in you got to answer
[70:46] them and when you answer them you got to
[70:48] have a lawyer and how long those lawyers
[70:51] letters and how much investigation and
[70:54] due diligence if your lawyer is not a
[70:56] digital expert and he doesn't have the
[70:58] tools you're going to get feed to death
[71:01] I have a client I have a friend amount
[71:04] literally paying 650,000 a month in
[71:08] legal fees over a$3 million audit s
[71:13] months he's already spent more money in
[71:15] legal fees can't stop it though as long
[71:18] as the other side has a question ask you
[71:22] have a lawyer on your payroll and then
[71:24] you have an auditor and then you have a
[71:26] forensic and then you have an expert an
[71:29] opinion expert they charge you just and
[71:32] you can't stop it unless you just go hey
[71:34] I Surrender can't pay anymore which is
[71:37] what's happening that's why I said me
[71:38] and sailor won't get in trouble because
[71:39] we'll continue to fund we didn't do
[71:41] anything dude we didn't do anything we
[71:44] can write this is something that this
[71:46] government needs to do I'm going to just
[71:47] share this with you because I think it's
[71:49] a brilliant idea and the reason I paid
[71:53] to get access to the next administ rtion
[71:56] pray to God we need a rule that no
[72:00] government and no private lawyer since
[72:03] our legal system is so [ __ ] up if you
[72:06] sue someone including the US government
[72:09] and you lose the case you should pay all
[72:12] the fees if you file a lawsuit against
[72:14] someone and stretch them so really [ __ ]
[72:17] with them and you lose the case pay all
[72:20] the fees that would stop half the
[72:22] lawsuits man it would stop half the
[72:25] consignment deals this class action
[72:27] against me there's no there's no one
[72:30] that's paying them it's the lawyers that
[72:34] are trying to take the commission 60 70%
[72:37] of whatever they
[72:38] get like if they thought that they were
[72:41] going to have to cover all my
[72:43] expenses this would get settled much
[72:46] quicker instead I'm going to have to
[72:48] spend three four5 million however long
[72:50] it takes to prove they're wrong and all
[72:53] it's done is Crush my innov
[72:56] it's it's crushed my desire to even do
[72:58] any business here like I don't need to
[73:01] employ 600 people dude I can buy a
[73:03] Bitcoin all day long I got 26 people in
[73:07] New York [ __ ] it I won't employ them
[73:09] either okay I'll just buy Bitcoin if you
[73:12] guys it's stunning you're penalizing
[73:15] people that actually hire people and
[73:18] it's the independence man it's guys like
[73:20] me that employ all the people Exon
[73:23] Mobile doesn't employ you you can't get
[73:26] a job with Chevron or VISA did you can
[73:29] get a job with me tomorrow right but I
[73:31] don't want you because you're just going
[73:33] to be too much trouble
[73:35] now cuz I got look at this I get this
[73:38] report the other day you I share all
[73:41] this stuff with the young guys because I
[73:43] wasn't expecting this right but I saw
[73:46] you looking at the clock if we need to
[73:47] go you let me know but look look at this
[73:49] this is a this is time sensitive man
[73:52] it's like oh it's an emergency mandatory
[73:55] finen filing card1 Enterprises must pay
[74:00] by 1231 2024 this looks like I mean this
[74:02] looks like I'm in trouble
[74:05] $500 penalty per day after 1231
[74:10] 2024 I didn't even know I own this
[74:13] company okay I'm going to get 15 of
[74:15] these dude when did this start happening
[74:18] okay when did this start happen this is
[74:21] like I feel like I'm living in Germany
[74:23] in 1940 man that's the
[74:25] that's sad penalizing people that bring
[74:28] the the country forward and not uh not
[74:33] incentivizing thing but actually punish
[74:35] them for for doing something great yeah
[74:37] as you said like the time is already
[74:39] passed one hour but it it's always great
[74:41] to speak with you we have the endro team
[74:44] that uh we always have the last time we
[74:46] also did it h where the previous guest
[74:48] is asking one question for the next
[74:50] guest without knowing who the next guest
[74:51] actually is and I think it's uh an
[74:53] really really really suiting one for you
[74:56] um the question from the previous guest
[74:58] to you is what is the most important
[75:00] educational value for you to be
[75:04] Sant to be solvent uh s yeah so free the
[75:09] best educational value I I think I think
[75:12] studying
[75:14] history um because what I wanted to say
[75:17] was I I get upset with my daughters
[75:20] every now and then because I hear stuff
[75:21] that goes on at school I said hey uh
[75:24] have you ever thought about saying hey I
[75:25] totally disagree with that that's
[75:27] ridiculous oh no no we wouldn't do that
[75:30] well you should do it you should be
[75:32] argumentative with
[75:33] people and and build an ability to
[75:37] confront anyone anytime including
[75:41] me uh on what their thesis is ask people
[75:46] what they believe in and challenge it
[75:49] okay but really ask yourself what you
[75:52] believe in I I don't think anybody
[75:54] actually sits down and say what the [ __ ]
[75:57] do I believe in sorry to use the
[75:59] language but like these are really
[76:01] important things and they're taken so
[76:04] casually they spend more time and energy
[76:07] on figuring out what college they're
[76:09] going to go to dude than who am I really
[76:14] who do I want to be and why the hell was
[76:17] I put on this planet what am I doing
[76:20] here I see 80% of the people going to
[76:23] work hating what they do that's not a
[76:27] cool way to live man so to me that's the
[76:30] the the inner work if I'm criticizing
[76:34] constantly I probably should look at
[76:36] what the hell I'm doing to create part
[76:38] of the
[76:39] problem if we I have so many things to
[76:42] fix in myself I fix myself first and
[76:45] then I get to start judging you and
[76:48] helping you change until then I should
[76:50] not say anything to anyone just mind my
[76:52] own business and try to create and
[76:55] surround myself with people that expect
[76:58] more of me than I expect of
[77:00] myself that if you do those two things
[77:03] man you've done a lot so that's what I
[77:06] would say Robin I guess you're going to
[77:08] ask me uh what question do I have for
[77:10] the next guest yes I do what I'm going
[77:15] to ask the same question I thought I
[77:16] asked you last time hey how do you
[77:18] define
[77:19] Freedom yeah that was the the question
[77:22] you you told me I should ask it to every
[77:24] guest uh following I did not ask every
[77:27] guest but I actually asking I think like
[77:30] every fourth or fifth guest because like
[77:32] what is freedom how do you define
[77:34] freedom and it actually came up more
[77:36] times like I think uh 10 guests or so
[77:39] ago it was all like hey can you ask the
[77:41] next guest what what does freedom
[77:42] actually mean like what what does
[77:44] freedom mean to you uh it's an it's an
[77:46] really important question and I will
[77:48] take it to the next guest again really
[77:50] so perfect uh thank you Gary so much for
[77:53] being on again it's been a pleasure with
