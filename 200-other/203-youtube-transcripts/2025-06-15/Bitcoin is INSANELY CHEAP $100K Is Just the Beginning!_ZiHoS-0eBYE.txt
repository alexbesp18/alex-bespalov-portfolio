[00:00] people who don't understand Bitcoin see
[00:02] 100K is sort of a natural top the way
[00:04] I'm sure they saw 1,000k as a natural
[00:06] top or 10,000k you never priced out of
[00:08] Bitcoin it's always incredibly cheap I
[00:10] think 100K is the last major Beast I
[00:13] don't even I don't think people will
[00:14] look at 1 million the way we're looking
[00:15] at 100K by then it'll be much more
[00:17] solidified in mainstream Consciousness
[00:20] in society as a pillar as a safe Haz it
[00:23] has to happen at 1 million I think
[00:25] exchanges start pricing things at SATs
[00:27] cuz it's one sat per penny at that point
[00:29] if you're using Bitcoin as your unit
[00:31] account you're going to outperform
[00:33] everyone it's like a superpower I wish
[00:35] retail got more involved and could
[00:37] partake CU I think it's the people's
[00:38] money I want to separate money from
[00:40] State the more people that are involved
[00:41] in that the better chance we have do you
[00:43] think we have the the chance to really
[00:46] completely separate out the fat system
[00:49] and and be on a Bitcoin only standard I
[00:52] think it's inevitable self- custody is a
[00:54] paradigm shift for Humanity to be able
[00:56] to protect and Carry Your wealth and
[00:58] transport it there's only the three
[00:59] things in the that are scares Bitcoin
[01:01] time and
[01:02] [Music]
[01:06] family hi cetri how you doing everything
[01:08] fine on your end yeah everything's great
[01:10] it's an exciting morning uh I guess just
[01:13] topically it's December 5th uh 12:47
[01:16] p.m. my time and Bitcoin broke 100K last
[01:19] night so was a little hard to go to
[01:21] sleep last night and I kind of got up a
[01:23] little earlier than usual this morning
[01:26] uh so yeah it's exciting oh yeah it's on
[01:29] your side it broke it in the in the
[01:31] evening for me it was like 3 in the
[01:32] morning so I I slept over it right right
[01:36] no yeah we were going to sleep as it was
[01:37] happening maybe it was around like 9 or
[01:39] 10 at night maybe 11 when it really was
[01:42] cranking till to I think it touched
[01:44] 104 in US
[01:47] Dollars yeah that was kind of fun um
[01:51] things have tapered off a little bit
[01:52] this morning which is kind of
[01:55] understandable um but it's kind of fun
[01:57] to be an open field uh past the 100K
[02:00] psychological barrier which is kind of
[02:02] just you know nominal and just
[02:06] arbitrary you know in just Fiat terms
[02:09] but I think it is a
[02:10] huge sort of uh psychological barrier
[02:14] for most people or especially you know
[02:16] US dollar minded uh unit of accounted
[02:19] unit of account people it's a really big
[02:22] moment yeah and I think a lot of people
[02:24] uh even outside of the US uh and outside
[02:27] of people that use the US dollar look at
[02:29] the dollar price and not the Euro price
[02:32] I remember when back in the day I made
[02:34] in German um videos on bitcoin on Tik
[02:38] Tok in 2020 like a long day ago um
[02:42] people were upset if I showed the Euro
[02:46] price because you should measure Bitcoin
[02:48] in the US dollar price apparently I mean
[02:51] it it makes sense because it's the the
[02:54] the the the Godfather the the the mother
[02:56] of all fat currencies and that's the the
[02:59] end goal where we want to be and that's
[03:01] kind of the scoreboard of how bad the
[03:03] Feld system is doing and we really want
[03:05] to get to the US dollar because that's
[03:08] the that's the Grand Daddy that we
[03:10] really wanna get over with yeah for sure
[03:14] and it seems like that's also big topic
[03:16] of conversation now with Powell talking
[03:18] about Bitcoin not being a competitor to
[03:20] the US dollar Jerome Powell you know fed
[03:22] chairman but more of a competitor to
[03:24] gold and I think he's you know right on
[03:27] one front and wrong on the other but you
[03:28] know I think gold is n next and that's a
[03:30] 9x from here uh so for a lot of people
[03:33] they look at sort of the gold market cap
[03:35] as as maybe the next stop but uh yeah
[03:37] it's kind of dynamic it's interesting
[03:39] fun uh even if you've I think something
[03:42] I've thought about even if you've
[03:43] expected this and you know kind of ran
[03:45] the numbers and kind of knew this would
[03:47] happen one day it's still I think very
[03:48] exciting and it's still interesting to
[03:50] go through and fun time to be alive what
[03:53] is the importance for for you about that
[03:57] that Milestone we know from the earlier
[04:00] the the videos where someone um and
[04:02] actually the same guy made it with
[04:04] 100,000 also where he he recorded with
[04:07] $100 uh the First videos and there are
[04:09] people of like $1 or like $1,000 what is
[04:13] the importance now of that $100,000
[04:15] because yeah Bitcoin is quite the same
[04:17] if it's at like 95 or like 120 or
[04:20] something like that sure yeah well I
[04:22] think that you know it really
[04:24] illuminates price vers value you know
[04:27] for someone who thinks that Bitcoin has
[04:29] infinite value value that each Bitcoin
[04:31] is going to be worth you know everything
[04:32] divided by 21 million you know this is
[04:35] sort of expected and it's not a a big
[04:38] deal it's just another number but for a
[04:40] lot of people uh you know it kind of
[04:42] makes you realize that we're early in
[04:44] the cycle or in bitcoin's trajectory
[04:47] because a lot of people who don't
[04:49] understand Bitcoin see 100K as sort of a
[04:51] natural top the way I'm sure they saw
[04:53] a,k is a natural top or
[04:56] 10,000k so a lot of people over the
[04:58] holidays were expressing
[05:00] surprise and shock and a over you know
[05:03] bitcoin's move to 95 96 98k they didn't
[05:06] understand Bitcoin but they also felt
[05:08] like it's over uh they missed it again
[05:11] 100K is the top it's endgame it's final
[05:14] it's now worth 100K it it it it it makes
[05:18] you it features that they're they're um
[05:22] focused on unit price bias so they're
[05:25] not thinking about the total market cap
[05:26] of Bitcoin the total addressable Market
[05:28] of Bitcoin what bitcoin's going after
[05:30] why it's valuable why it comes here
[05:31] they're just saying all I know is the
[05:33] last time you told me about this thing
[05:34] it was 15,000 or 30,000 or 55,000 wow
[05:39] it's worth a lot more this is a natural
[05:43] Top This is 100k this is a round number
[05:45] and for Bitcoin there's just another one
[05:47] in front of more
[05:49] zeros and we expect the next one in
[05:51] front of more zeros one day and then
[05:53] more zeros after that but for just I
[05:56] don't know it's just that big round
[05:58] number and they're like I guess we're
[05:59] done we're done here you were early I'm
[06:02] late it's over and uh it makes you know
[06:06] you have to be really or I strived to be
[06:09] really humble in those moments and I
[06:12] didn't just well it's GNA you you're G
[06:13] to say the same exact thing at 10
[06:15] million you know a million and then 10
[06:16] million and 100 million because I I
[06:18] tried saying that a thousand or really
[06:21] more like 5,000 and 10,000 and
[06:24] 20,000 but um here we are again and so
[06:28] it's that big round number and I you
[06:30] know this Cycle's very different
[06:32] retail's not as interested I think they
[06:34] are getting you're never priced out of
[06:36] Bitcoin it's always incredibly cheap
[06:38] it's always the cheapest thing on Earth
[06:40] but in terms of unit price biased a lot
[06:42] of people are like I'll never get a
[06:43] whole Bitcoin I they not trading with
[06:46] their future self they're trading with
[06:47] you so there's there's disappointment
[06:50] for them in this moment there's
[06:52] dismay um there's anger there's
[06:54] resentment there's a lot to unpacked
[06:56] there when they're kind of you know into
[06:58] friends and family comment on price and
[07:01] things like that but um yeah I think
[07:03] 100K is is sort of the last major Beast
[07:07] I don't even I don't think people will
[07:08] look at 1 million the way we're looking
[07:10] at 100K
[07:11] though um right I don't think that like
[07:15] there'll be as big a moment from 990,000
[07:18] to 1.1 one million or when we cross 1
[07:21] million in terms of I mean it'll be just
[07:22] as exciting but I think by then it'll be
[07:24] much more solidified
[07:26] in sort of mainstream Consciousness in
[07:29] in society as a pillar as a safe haven
[07:32] as a safe haven as a trusted institution
[07:35] not an institution in the sense that
[07:37] it's run by men and women or it has
[07:39] rulers and not you know it's still going
[07:41] to be rules without
[07:44] rulers but I don't think it's going to
[07:46] be a momentous moment maybe I'm naive
[07:49] but I think this is the last one that's
[07:52] celebrated in that manner
[07:54] yeah for me it's really
[07:56] interesting when do you think we we
[07:59] switch kind of to a smaller unit when we
[08:02] look at the price at Sates or maybe even
[08:05] something something else because of the
[08:08] unit bu is something really interesting
[08:11] but at some point it probably doesn't
[08:13] make sense for us to track the one
[08:17] Bitcoin number because it's just like
[08:19] such a big number and makes sense maybe
[08:21] to to track a Satoshi number or maybe
[08:23] something in between I don't know what
[08:25] will
[08:26] happen yeah I definitely I think it has
[08:28] to happen at 1 mli I think exchanges
[08:31] start pricing things at SATs cuz it's
[08:32] one sat per penny at that point um it's
[08:36] a FR uh unit price bias and the Satoshi
[08:39] thing has been very frustrated because
[08:40] you lose a lot of people when you start
[08:42] saying like you could buy fractions of a
[08:44] Bitcoin there's a hundred million of
[08:46] them per Bitcoin they're like whoa this
[08:48] thing is weird it's funky and it they
[08:50] it's really hard for them to make the
[08:52] parallel between Bitcoin and uh SATs and
[08:56] dollars and
[08:57] cents it's it's for some reason you know
[09:01] it's very hard like you know to say to
[09:02] someone like well you know just cuz
[09:04] you're not going to get paid $100,000
[09:06] this weekend doesn't mean that you
[09:07] wouldn't go to work for $100 a day or
[09:09] $200 a day or $300 a day like you don't
[09:12] start at that $1 million note
[09:15] unit uh but in Bitcoin for some reason
[09:18] you know people have a hard time
[09:19] breaking it down and but and I've said
[09:22] this before on my own show but at 1
[09:23] million per Bitcoin it's one sat per
[09:27] Penny and at that point I think
[09:29] people who are are used to thinking in
[09:32] terms of
[09:33] reallocation not just allocating new
[09:35] money to bitcoin because I think that's
[09:38] with retail most of how they think about
[09:40] oh I'm gonna you want me to buy this
[09:42] Bitcoin thing like I'd have to have X
[09:43] amount of dollars lying around to buy it
[09:46] that are not being used for anything
[09:48] else vers oh I already have X amount of
[09:52] dollars in gold let me just take half my
[09:54] gold call my my you know broker at
[09:57] Fidelity and say I want half my gold
[09:59] position now allocated to bitcoin they
[10:01] don't care what the price is at that
[10:02] point they just want to move from one
[10:04] thing to the other but at one cent per
[10:07] sat these these kinds of people making
[10:09] this move don't care about paying two
[10:11] cents per sat I mean it could literally
[10:12] double on the overnight wait a mean oh
[10:15] it's one cent per sat and I need this
[10:17] thing I'll pay one I'll pay 1.2 per sat
[10:20] I'll pay one and a half cents per sat
[10:22] like it just what whatever my allocation
[10:25] is I would pay that
[10:26] unit uh incremental increase because it
[10:28] sounds so
[10:30] cheap and uh I think that would be a big
[10:32] mindset or mind shift for a lot of
[10:35] people when you start talking in Satoshi
[10:37] I mean I wish in a way and I think
[10:40] Satoshi might have wanted this and I
[10:42] don't advocate for any real change now
[10:45] but if you do like the the mo the the
[10:46] modeling in your head it would be I
[10:48] think so much better if there were just
[10:50] Bitcoins and then for hundred million
[10:53] Bitcoins you had like say a
[10:55] Satoshi and you just said oh like you
[10:58] just bought a th000 Bitcoins or a
[10:59] million Bitcoins or 10 million Bitcoins
[11:02] and I think at this point I understand
[11:04] that in the beginning that didn't make
[11:05] sense because no one wanted to buy three
[11:07] you know 400 million Bitcoins for 18
[11:11] cents it it didn't make sense but now it
[11:13] does and so I'm not advocating for real
[11:15] change I'm not saying the community
[11:17] where people should get together and and
[11:18] and have a campaign but it would make
[11:20] things much more explainable to you know
[11:23] what we would call retailer
[11:25] normies yeah and I think that change
[11:27] will naturally occur I mean uh for
[11:30] example my exchange that I use in
[11:32] Austria already shows by default uh uh
[11:36] your uh how many Bitcoins you have in
[11:38] satos actually and it feels really good
[11:42] to be honest if if a stack Sates and
[11:44] it's like shows like 3.5 million sat I'm
[11:47] like
[11:49] wow compared when you see the Bitcoin
[11:51] number to it it's like oh like that's
[11:53] not that's not too much and even though
[11:56] uh it's it's just a unit thing but PE
[11:59] like people really think in units like
[12:01] they think in one day or one week or
[12:04] they think in like uh oh I want to have
[12:06] one class of that or also with like
[12:09] Bitcoin it's like oh I want to have one
[12:11] Bitcoin I be want to be a whole coiner
[12:13] or I want to have 10 Bitcoin like those
[12:17] things actually matter to our human
[12:20] psychology uh but actually it doesn't
[12:23] matter like like what what will you do
[12:27] like uh the 21 million limit could also
[12:29] be 42 million maybe he he chose that
[12:33] number or it could be 10 million uh we
[12:36] don't like that's just an arbitrary
[12:38] number and then it would all be be
[12:40] different so but yeah I I get why unit
[12:44] is is really um important uh for for
[12:48] human beings even for me I see myself if
[12:50] I see the same amount of Bitcoin even
[12:53] like half the amount of Bitcoin in
[12:54] satorious versus the double the amount
[12:57] in Bitcoin I'm thinking like oh like I'm
[12:59] way richer with the Sates than I feel
[13:02] with my my Bitcoin that's a that's a
[13:05] real thing that I've uh discovered even
[13:09] on my own even four years into Bitcoin
[13:11] and I think especially with beginners
[13:12] it's way more the case I I guess so yeah
[13:17] for sure I think that I think unit of
[13:20] account is the you know superpower of
[13:22] Bitcoin even if you don't have a lot of
[13:24] Bitcoin you have just a few SATs or
[13:27] whatever you might have thinking Bitcoin
[13:29] is using Bitcoin as your unit of account
[13:32] and and what that will enable you to do
[13:34] is just beat everyone you ever face on
[13:36] Earth in calculations maybe not
[13:39] dramatically at each trade but over time
[13:41] you're going to make better trades
[13:43] against others for yourself for your
[13:45] family you're going to just make better
[13:47] economic calculations and what what
[13:48] using economics is and you get this from
[13:51] saine's book principle of Economics is
[13:53] all about just making better life
[13:55] decisions to maximize your leisure right
[13:58] how do you get the most out of your
[13:59] ability to work and perform and produce
[14:01] so that you can consume and uh rest and
[14:05] relax when you choose to or want to or
[14:07] have more of that so how do you make all
[14:09] these calculations and if you're using
[14:11] Bitcoin as your unit account you're
[14:12] going to outperform every B it's like a
[14:15] superow not just if you're running a
[14:16] business but if you're just buying
[14:18] groceries or whatever it is but to your
[14:20] point it's you know using Bitcoin as
[14:22] your unit account is difficult if you
[14:25] don't think in Bitcoin a lot and you
[14:28] know the the the the the Dominator is
[14:30] not always easy to work with uh because
[14:32] it's large and and that's why a lot of
[14:35] people um are frustrated by the unit
[14:38] bias uh even if they're just looking to
[14:40] make their first purchase I know for
[14:42] myself when I went to make my first
[14:44] purchase my you know buy my first SATs
[14:47] um Bitcoin you know I was using the
[14:49] Legacy system to move my money and it
[14:53] was making an a from my bank to The
[14:56] Exchange and it took so many business
[14:58] days that the price of Bitcoin went up
[15:01] 50% and by the time my money landed so I
[15:04] wasn't going to be able to buy a whole
[15:06] Bitcoin and that was an incredibly
[15:08] frustrating moment it was Illuminating a
[15:10] lot of ways because at the time I I
[15:11] wasn't thinking about payment rails
[15:13] right like Bitcoin is faster payment
[15:14] rails I hadn't bought Bitcoin yet I had
[15:16] moved it off an exchange yet or maybe
[15:18] I'd heard that but like I wasn't but uh
[15:21] I was frustrated by the banking system
[15:23] which helped me with Bitcoin later on
[15:25] and that was a really clear-cut case of
[15:27] it but now I'm on the ex change and I'm
[15:30] not [ __ ] hate coinbase for this but
[15:32] you know they had Bitcoin ethereum and
[15:35] Litecoin and I'm thinking that for some
[15:37] reason these three things belong in the
[15:39] same bucket or the same asset class
[15:42] somehow some way the only way I could
[15:44] figure it out is by maybe blockchain
[15:45] ties them together but because I
[15:47] couldn't buy one whole Bitcoin I was now
[15:50] more motivated or inspired incentified
[15:53] to kind of maybe buy some of these [ __ ]
[15:55] coins because I could buy whole of
[15:57] them and I was still not going to get a
[15:59] whole Bitcoin so why not buy half a
[16:01] Bitcoin instead of two-thirds of a
[16:02] Bitcoin or whatever was at the time why
[16:05] not buy a quarter of a Bitcoin and buy
[16:06] five or 10 of these and three and five
[16:08] of those and those things actually ran
[16:11] more in the next six weeks than Bitcoin
[16:13] did towards the end of 2017 so I was all
[16:15] confused now these things were
[16:16] outperforming Bitcoin you know maybe I
[16:18] was earlier to these things and they're
[16:21] similar uh maybe they're all the same
[16:23] you know they're similar horses in the
[16:25] same race um so yeah unit Buy
[16:29] is is is really tough for people and
[16:32] confusing and U but it's part about
[16:35] learning about money and market cap and
[16:37] markets and trading and um store value
[16:41] and and having a reserve asset uh and
[16:43] what you're taking profits in absolutely
[16:46] and I want to get to Alon a little later
[16:49] because it's uh interesting how this
[16:50] cycle they kind of a non topic but
[16:53] before I want to get into um uh 100K uh
[16:58] being a trigger for uh maybe retail to
[17:02] wake up a little bit you said it before
[17:04] retail is not really part of that
[17:06] Bitcoin cycle till now it seems like
[17:08] only institutions Michael saor and maybe
[17:11] America soon is is buying Bitcoin uh
[17:14] which is for me a sad story like I I I
[17:16] want uh America to sell their Bitcoin
[17:19] and the PLS buying Bitcoin
[17:22] um will that 100K now coming into the
[17:26] mainstream cycle now coming into uh out
[17:29] of news cycle is that maybe a trigger
[17:32] for the the retail folks to finally wake
[17:35] up or as you said before it's like the
[17:38] oh it's over now and now I don't even
[17:40] look at Bitcoin because now it's only
[17:42] going down from here well I think
[17:44] they're going to be triggers I think
[17:46] maybe more like 110k when we really
[17:48] break through Bitcoin and more open
[17:50] field I think it'll start to be on CNBC
[17:52] more and all those sort of business
[17:55] channels uh it's going to be in people's
[17:57] faces and I think for people that
[18:00] uh you know still want to convert their
[18:03] assets or get exposure to this it's
[18:04] still they're still early and so some
[18:06] people are going to get it it's not that
[18:07] retail is priced out no one's ever
[18:09] priced out but I think the majority of
[18:11] the money coming to the table are not
[18:13] aren't going to be retail going forward
[18:15] even um but they'll have the opportunity
[18:17] I think they'll get the triggers the
[18:18] signals they'll see the movement it's up
[18:20] to them though to uh find out if or
[18:25] learn if they think that this thing
[18:26] could go to like say a million or more
[18:28] or be what the bitcoiners think it is uh
[18:30] and do their own work and do their own
[18:32] research uh the opportunity will be
[18:34] there and they're not priced out but uh
[18:37] they are in the sense though in terms of
[18:39] if if retail wanted to go in and go all
[18:41] in I don't you know it's not the same
[18:43] amount of capital that institutions are
[18:45] going to bring to the table and and
[18:47] Bitcoin is for enemies I'm not rooting
[18:49] for retail to be uh you know less of a
[18:53] driver of bitcoin's price going forward
[18:55] I wish retail got more involved and
[18:58] could parte because I think it's the
[18:59] people's money you know I don't think
[19:01] it's just a trade or way to make money
[19:04] and I think it's a way to defend
[19:05] yourself and I I I want to separate
[19:07] money from State and I wanted I think
[19:10] the more people that are involved in
[19:11] that the better chance we have and the
[19:14] you know the sooner they get involved
[19:15] the better chance we have and and you
[19:17] want to help your loved ones and your
[19:18] friends and family and that's what I
[19:19] think of when we when we don't think of
[19:21] I don't think of retail derisively I
[19:24] mean I think it's just you know normal
[19:26] everyday people and that's who we've all
[19:28] been been advocating for um but we're
[19:32] watching sale or speculative attack at
[19:34] the corporate level and soon it's going
[19:35] to be the nation state level and you
[19:39] know they're going to drive the price I
[19:40] think a lot higher just with the the
[19:42] amount of capital they bring to the
[19:44] table 100% um do you think we have the
[19:48] the chance to really completely separate
[19:51] out the the fear system and and be on a
[19:54] on a Bitcoin only standard it seems to
[19:56] be very controversial these days Bitcoin
[20:00] I think it's inevitable I don't think
[20:02] it's uh happening soon and uh so I I
[20:06] think it's like kind of I think that's a
[20:08] really hard conversation to have for
[20:10] people who uh want to thread the needle
[20:12] more
[20:13] publicly and uh they don't want to touch
[20:16] that third
[20:18] rail so but I mean if you just do the
[20:21] math I mean if you say okay it's going
[20:23] to take 50 years 100 years maybe 140
[20:25] years I think it's
[20:27] inevitable that those things kind of
[20:28] Wither and
[20:29] crumble um or
[20:32] are uh are are reborn in a way that we
[20:36] can't imagine right now the way you know
[20:40] Amazon attacked books first and you
[20:43] thought they were going for physical
[20:45] book retailers and they were really
[20:47] going for every single vertical on
[20:49] retail vertical on Earth but even Jeff
[20:51] didn't know about you know AWS and cloud
[20:54] computing so there'll be you know uses
[20:56] for Bitcoin and different layers that we
[20:58] can't fathom now um so you know money
[21:03] and uh Fiat and private money might last
[21:05] for a long time but I think it's
[21:07] inevitable that the M you know money
[21:10] gets separated from
[21:11] State I I definitely hope so and that's
[21:14] that's the whole whole purpose I feel
[21:16] like from from Bitcoin but now quickly
[21:19] to do do the altcoin topic um I just
[21:23] don't see them that much in this in this
[21:26] cycle like I I remember in in the 2017
[21:29] cycle 2020 cycle 2021 especially also
[21:34] outs were extremely present uh even in
[21:37] my Twitter feed in in the comments and
[21:41] now I get those spam comments of like
[21:44] complete scams like there like weird
[21:48] tokens that they just try to to to pump
[21:50] with with Bots um but that whole altcoin
[21:54] cycle seems to like slow down a little
[21:56] bit maybe I'm just too deep in the
[21:57] Bitcoin only
[21:59] uh
[22:00] Bob but do do you do you also have the
[22:03] same experience I feel the way you do
[22:05] but I think that's because we're really
[22:06] deep in the Bitcoin ecosystem and sort
[22:08] of that bubble uh I do when I I I ran
[22:12] into a lot of people from my high school
[22:14] reunion recently and they're all into
[22:16] altcoins all I use that pejoratively
[22:19] they're not all into altcoins but some
[22:20] of the ones I talked to were very much
[22:22] like what do you think about crypto and
[22:24] what about this coin and that coin and
[22:26] I'm seeing that percolate more um um I
[22:28] think Ripple just maybe I don't follow
[22:31] this but maybe they just want a case
[22:32] against the SEC or something and there's
[22:34] been a big pump and I do feel like but I
[22:37] also think that uh so there's I think
[22:39] three things I think it's still there we
[22:41] see it less but I also think micro
[22:44] strategy has kind of destroyed altcoins
[22:46] from any rational
[22:48] perspective uh so I'm not calling micro
[22:50] strategy a shitcoin I mean you can call
[22:52] everything a shitcoin then that's not
[22:53] Bitcoin then but I think and I think
[22:55] it's the world's greatest security ever
[22:57] created on public markets uh like in the
[23:01] history of mankind but again it's not a
[23:02] reason to sell your Bitcoin or it's not
[23:04] Bitcoin it's it's something very
[23:06] different maybe it's great if you have
[23:07] money trapped in this in in this
[23:09] retirement system or the system I think
[23:11] it's really great for people that H are
[23:14] institutions that can only buy bonds and
[23:17] institutions that can only buy stocks
[23:19] and not ETFs and things like that so I
[23:21] think he's refining Bitcoin for certain
[23:25] markets um but I think that sort of
[23:27] destroyed all coins in a lot of ways um
[23:30] because it's just if you really want to
[23:32] like
[23:33] maybe uh juice your returns gamble
[23:37] whatever it is that or leverage that you
[23:39] would get out of [ __ ] coining you could
[23:41] kind of get it now with micro strategy
[23:43] and have it be tied uh to bitcoin uh
[23:47] tied maybe not in a direct way you don't
[23:49] get Bitcoin when you exit or anything
[23:51] like that but it's you know
[23:53] related uh more so than than those other
[23:56] things and I think the narratives on
[23:57] those other things are are getting
[23:59] weaker um but I don't think there you
[24:01] know I mean I think you know we'll see
[24:03] at some point like there's a lot of
[24:04] optimism right now I think you'll see
[24:06] again a big push back towards like the
[24:08] wef and these sort of organizations
[24:11] looking to uh blockchain and Ai and put
[24:14] information on AI and put decisions on
[24:16] AI and people are G to be like which AI
[24:18] what Chain's going to be involved in Ai
[24:20] and all that [ __ ] I don't even know
[24:22] how to like like give the Spiel anymore
[24:25] for their side but I I think they'll see
[24:27] some of that and so I don't think it's
[24:30] over um but I do feel as Bitcoin as we
[24:32] feel it less it's it's super interesting
[24:35] I smiled when you said mik strategy
[24:37] because uh I I've said that since a few
[24:40] episodes now that I feel like the the
[24:42] new distraction from Bitcoin self-
[24:44] custody are now no longer altcoins but
[24:47] Micro strategy and I I I have a deep
[24:51] respect for what micel saor is doing and
[24:53] I think M micro strategy is doing a
[24:55] great job in evangelizing for Bitcoin
[24:58] and also driving the price up just like
[25:01] buying a lot but I personally just
[25:04] wouldn't buy the stocks like I I like
[25:06] Bitcoin of custody and now you kind of
[25:09] see the crowd that is really here for
[25:11] freedom and for the freedom go up
[25:12] technology and the other crowd in
[25:15] Bitcoin that just wants to the highest
[25:16] number go up technology uh and they are
[25:19] kind of switching or have a micro
[25:21] strategy play uh I mean there are some
[25:24] people that just want to support micro
[25:26] strategy as a company and it's like yeah
[25:28] let's put 1% of my portfolio micro
[25:30] strategy just that I be part of that
[25:33] story uh but uh most of them that are in
[25:36] micro strategy want that leverage of of
[25:40] Bitcoin and uh it's I always said it's
[25:43] it's the same distraction from Bitcoin
[25:45] self custody as previous altcoins but
[25:48] it's interesting how you framed it as
[25:49] like a micro strategy P away from the
[25:53] from the altcoin uh season it's an
[25:56] interesting perspective on on that yeah
[25:58] it's also going to Hoover up the bond
[26:01] market I mean he's offering Bond buyers
[26:04] like pensions they can't buy Bitcoin
[26:06] they can't buy the
[26:07] ETF so they want exposure and they can
[26:11] they can loan him money at 0% because
[26:14] they know it's backed by
[26:16] Bitcoin and or you know 75 basis points
[26:20] and they can't that's their way to get
[26:23] Bitcoin and there's trillions in that
[26:25] that can't buy Spot Bitcoin
[26:28] because of the rules and the uh the fby
[26:31] and accounting regulations around
[26:32] carrying it on their balance sheet so
[26:34] he's he's refining Bitcoin for
[26:37] them uh and and that's not us maybe and
[26:41] it gives them none of the benefits of
[26:43] what you mentioned self- custody I mean
[26:44] self- custody is a paradigm shift for
[26:47] Humanity to be able to protect and Carry
[26:49] Your wealth and transport it and all
[26:51] these things and I don't even think that
[26:54] the that those qualities of Bitcoin I
[26:56] think which probably help helped it in
[26:58] the beginning a lot more than helps it
[27:00] right now I think those qualities will
[27:01] come back as Nations States and
[27:05] corporations start to stack Bitcoin and
[27:06] really start to then because you can't
[27:08] even you know fathom certain ways of
[27:12] thinking or or perspectives about um
[27:15] holding Bitcoin until you do and even
[27:17] when you hold maybe like let's say you
[27:20] start with $100 in self- custody you're
[27:22] going to think
[27:24] about that self- custody when it grows
[27:27] either naturally through purchase price
[27:29] appreciation against the dollar or you
[27:31] add to it right so now if it's worth 100
[27:33] Grand you're going to think about it
[27:35] differently you might have a different
[27:36] setup for protecting it you might
[27:38] involve other people in a legacy plan or
[27:40] inheritance plan and all of that keeps
[27:42] changing as it grows in value and this
[27:44] and and and there's an evolution for
[27:47] corporations and nation states that they
[27:49] haven't even gone on that Journey yet
[27:52] how they think about you know their
[27:54] exposure to this asset and what value it
[27:56] brings to them
[27:58] so you know Michael sailor first you
[28:01] know looked at it as like I have a $500
[28:02] million melting Ice Cube so he was a
[28:04] brilliant engineer entrepreneur CEO he's
[28:08] looking at his melting Ice Cube and he
[28:09] starts doing the ab test like what where
[28:11] should I I treasuries are not working
[28:14] they've gone from a plus to a
[28:16] minus and and and he makes the
[28:18] calculation that he can't give it all
[28:20] back to shareholders through dividends
[28:23] BuyBacks Etc because he has to keep the
[28:25] lights on he has to promise shareholders
[28:27] that they're going to be running in 20
[28:28] years he has to all stakeholders have to
[28:30] be guaranteed service in perpetuity so
[28:33] you have to have reserves you can't give
[28:35] that back so you have to protect it you
[28:38] should grow it you should manage it so
[28:40] he's like okay I'm going to look at all
[28:42] the what six or seven asset classes you
[28:44] know real estate Fine Art stocks bonds
[28:48] treasuries gold Bitcoin and I'm going to
[28:51] pick the winner right because again back
[28:53] to diversification like I I have 10 kids
[28:56] and there's I'm on the Titanic and
[28:58] sinking there's 10 lifeboats and nine
[28:59] lifeboats have holes in them am I going
[29:01] to put my you know each kid in a boat
[29:05] and diversify there odds of making it or
[29:07] we all going in the boat that has no
[29:09] holes so now he's like okay I'm in the
[29:11] boat with the holes I start buying this
[29:13] thing and now what else can I do with it
[29:15] oh wow I can become a Bitcoin Refinery I
[29:18] didn't see that three years ago when I
[29:19] started stacking right I just saw per
[29:21] you know a share price appreciation I
[29:23] didn't think about Bitcoin yield per
[29:26] share when I started this but now now
[29:28] that I'm in this seat and I'm This
[29:29] brilliant engineer you know maybe the
[29:31] best architect engineer on Earth and I'm
[29:34] an engineer you know and financialized
[29:36] this security and and he's going to play
[29:40] he like watching Babe Ruth in the stock
[29:41] market speculative attack the whole
[29:44] Market you know why wouldn't you root
[29:46] them on doesn't mean that you have to
[29:47] give them your money and that you have
[29:48] to give up all the attributes of Bitcoin
[29:51] um it doesn't have to be for you but you
[29:53] don't have to root against them either
[29:55] you know um I think it's wild I
[29:58] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[30:02] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[30:04] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[30:07] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[30:10] vigilante made in perfect Bitcoin watch
[30:13] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[30:16] go out there and show that you are a
[30:19] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[30:21] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[30:25] dropped a completely new and amazing ch
[30:28] edition of their watch collections you
[30:31] have the date of the first ever mined
[30:34] Bitcoin Block in there and of course
[30:36] also the block height and which EPO we
[30:39] are currently in I love the level of
[30:42] detail they put in in this masterpiece
[30:45] and make sure to check out those amazing
[30:48] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[30:51] descriptions I love those watches so so
[30:54] much if you watch or listen to my
[30:56] podcast on a regular basis is I guess
[30:58] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[31:01] the most important step is to keep the
[31:04] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[31:07] wallet my personal recommendation for
[31:09] Hardware wallet is the bitbox it's super
[31:11] secure it's simple to set up it's also a
[31:14] perfect gift for a friend who has still
[31:16] their Bitcoin on an exchange and you can
[31:19] get a 5% discount with the code Robin at
[31:22] the checkout visit bitbox do Swiss
[31:26] robobin to get your your bitbox and the
[31:29] next step is to really level up your
[31:31] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[31:34] have the most secure self custody setup
[31:37] you have to secure your own devices you
[31:40] have to protect your privacy you have to
[31:42] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[31:45] on where you live you even want to have
[31:47] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[31:50] move in case something goes really
[31:52] really wrong and through all those steps
[31:54] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[31:57] step by by step and if you visit the
[31:59] Bitcoin way.com SLP Partners robobin you
[32:03] even get a 30 minute free call to find
[32:06] out how you can level up your
[32:09] sovereignty yeah absolutely I think it's
[32:11] also he he's a smart
[32:14] cookie doing smart
[32:16] things you know I mean the biggest
[32:19] concern you'd have to have is around
[32:21] custody um and you know anybody so again
[32:25] if you're doing anything that's close to
[32:28] micro strategy from from Mara to
[32:33] Microsoft to Dell I mean you're in you
[32:35] know you you have to worry about how
[32:36] they manage their assets right but any
[32:38] of these sort of public companies that
[32:39] are buying Bitcoin you have to manage
[32:41] you know or the ETFs how are they
[32:42] managing the the the the asset the
[32:45] Bitcoin that that'd be your main concern
[32:47] I do think that they should move to sort
[32:49] of a proof of Reserves at some point
[32:51] micro strategy they should figure that
[32:53] out with their custodians or something
[32:54] be more transparent on that that would
[32:56] be nice to see um um I I I you know I
[32:59] you know I'm a don't trust verifi kind
[33:01] of person so again like these are
[33:04] reasons that you buy Bitcoin in self
[33:06] custody you're not gaining this with
[33:07] micro strategy it might be a great way
[33:09] to get Grandma exposure to you know uh
[33:12] bitcoin price appreciation it might be
[33:13] way a great way to you know get uh
[33:16] exposure to price appreciation of
[33:18] Bitcoin in your 401k or your Roth or
[33:20] whatever you feel your money's trapped
[33:22] in um but you know it's not Bitcoin but
[33:25] it's it's fascinating to see what he can
[33:27] do
[33:28] uh CU I mean to think that we'd never
[33:30] see the financialization of Bitcoin and
[33:31] Bitcoin like products I think would be
[33:33] naive I mean I come from a financi
[33:35] accounting background I I don't think
[33:37] banking Is Wrong I Don't Think Credit is
[33:39] wrong maybe the system is [ __ ] up
[33:41] maybe all the rules are wrong in terms
[33:44] of uh fractional Reserve banking maybe
[33:46] it should be 100% backed but uh people
[33:49] are always going to uh there's always
[33:50] going to be situations going forward
[33:51] where people have capital and don't know
[33:54] how to not don't how they want to deploy
[33:56] it and allocate it but they don't
[33:57] necessarily want to owner
[33:58] operators right and they're going to be
[34:00] people that don't have capital and have
[34:02] ideas and want to build things and and
[34:04] want to be owner
[34:06] operators um and so I think there's
[34:08] always going to be an opportunity for
[34:09] Lending and credit and securities and
[34:12] bonds and all these things and maybe
[34:14] they're all backed with Bitcoin one day
[34:16] and maybe that you know and maybe it's a
[34:18] fair and just system and we're not
[34:19] pitted against each other with these
[34:21] tools and we're not dealing with the
[34:22] bank with with the state [ __ ] and
[34:24] debasing our money but it doesn't mean
[34:26] all those things go away and so there's
[34:27] going to be a bridge on the way to there
[34:29] and doesn't even mean what Michael stor
[34:31] is doing right now is in an endgame uh
[34:33] he's trying different things maybe it
[34:35] all blows up in his face maybe he tries
[34:37] something and it something goes wrong
[34:40] like he's Enron or something you know I
[34:42] don't think that's where it's going but
[34:44] again all these risks are included it's
[34:46] one of the reasons I think that's so
[34:47] great about Bitcoin is you eliminate
[34:49] that you eliminate business risk it's
[34:51] like with real estate you have you have
[34:52] location risk you have repairs and
[34:55] maintenance you have all these sort of
[34:56] different risk factors right you going
[34:57] tenant um you run a business are you
[35:00] going to get you know you want to open
[35:01] up a bar can you get a license from the
[35:03] mayor you know will your competitor get
[35:05] a better license from the mayor or deny
[35:08] you a license so they can have a better
[35:09] business right political risk there's
[35:12] business risk there's so Bitcoin
[35:15] eliminates all that I I think of it as
[35:17] sort of the risk-free asset you're not
[35:19] you know you have your share of the
[35:20] network and nobody can debase that come
[35:22] between it you just have to learn how to
[35:24] store and manage it properly and and
[35:26] from again from your first amount of
[35:28] SATs you're going to one day be wealthy
[35:31] this thing is going to increase in value
[35:32] infinitely forever so even if you have a
[35:35] small amount if you can hold on and
[35:37] manage that for a while and just do your
[35:39] life in the meantime you're going to be
[35:40] wealthy one day and I think that is
[35:43] powerful that changes how you go about
[35:47] everything in your life you know you you
[35:49] become more low time preference and you
[35:53] make again even just better decisions
[35:55] maybe not better calculations but maybe
[35:57] emotionally you're in a better place to
[35:59] make decisions you're more stabilized
[36:02] you know maybe your health is get I mean
[36:03] Dr Jeff Ross talks about Bitcoin is
[36:05] essentially Healthcare you know you're
[36:08] going to be healthier just by being on a
[36:09] Bitcoin standard is it's going to change
[36:12] how you look at Food it's going to
[36:13] change how you look at you know maybe
[36:15] exercise or change how you look at your
[36:17] relationships and and and you know
[36:20] stress is a
[36:21] killer you know if you're waking up
[36:23] every day trying to figure out how to
[36:25] make money you know um uh Michael
[36:27] dunworth talks about Bitcoin should be a
[36:29] it's like a fruit tree so you know you
[36:32] plant your fruit tree and even if you
[36:34] you know if you don't consume all the
[36:36] treat and uh fruit and manage to save a
[36:38] few seeds you just going get more fruit
[36:41] trees and eventually you're going to
[36:43] have more fruit than you can you know
[36:46] eat and you'll be able to share instead
[36:48] of take you know so uh I yeah I think
[36:53] just being in your mind on a Bitcoin
[36:54] standard can change your life how has
[36:57] Bitcoin impacted uh your life so far in
[37:00] all those ways you know I think the one
[37:03] way that's inverse for Bitcoin is you
[37:05] think Bitcoin is going to give you your
[37:06] time back and then Bitcoin takes all
[37:08] your time so you know I started a
[37:11] podcast and I go to conferences now you
[37:14] know and so it's a stay and I'm giving
[37:16] my time to bitcoin but like you know it
[37:19] consumes you um and maybe more of that
[37:21] time should be with my friends and
[37:23] family you know uh as I had promised
[37:25] myself and so you know
[37:28] um but yeah it's changed me dramatically
[37:31] and you know I don't think it's changed
[37:32] me at my
[37:34] core right I don't think it's like
[37:35] changed me like I'm not a different
[37:38] person but it's enabled me I think to be
[37:41] a better version of myself and to
[37:44] um FOC focus on the things that I had
[37:47] kind of pushed aside the parts of me
[37:49] that I kind of pushed aside like like
[37:51] that you could sum it up maybe like in
[37:52] conspiracy theories and questioning
[37:54] thing I had pushed a lot of that aside I
[37:56] just started to you know I'd be like I
[37:58] don't think I agree with that but
[38:01] everyone is saying that that's I'm not
[38:03] you know don't be you know don't think
[38:04] like that or whatever and Bitcoin was
[38:06] the first thing where you could be like
[38:08] I I can disagree with you but like it's
[38:10] mathematically proven here you you can't
[38:12] prove me
[38:14] wrong so uh it was very Empower
[38:16] empowering in that way and you you know
[38:19] I think it helps you find for me like
[38:21] minded people the truth Seekers I think
[38:23] that's the one thing we have in common I
[38:24] don't think
[38:25] Bitcoins have as much common is you
[38:28] might think aside from maybe being truth
[38:30] Seekers especially as more and more
[38:32] people use Bitcoin it's kind of like you
[38:35] know with the dollar you wouldn't walk
[38:37] around now with a dollar symbol on your
[38:39] on your necklace and think you're cool
[38:42] you would just be showing off like some
[38:43] form of weird wealth right uh it would
[38:46] be unnecessary and you wouldn't have to
[38:48] like support it in that way it would
[38:49] just be ubiquitous and everyone uses it
[38:53] um but I think we're going through that
[38:54] period where Bitcoin is sort of like
[38:56] hipop and it's like culture and it's
[38:57] like a movement and so people do want to
[38:59] wear it on their clothing and do want to
[39:01] kind of talk about it and have Bitcoin
[39:03] themed music because I think it's where
[39:05] the most important ideas are taking
[39:06] place even if all the ideas aren't
[39:08] that's why I do the show it's like it's
[39:10] not that all every idea is rooted in
[39:12] Bitcoin but seems like bitcoiners are
[39:15] are being grabbed by the most
[39:16] interesting ideas in the
[39:18] world that's super interesting yeah and
[39:22] yeah it definitely consumes like Bitcoin
[39:25] definitely consumes you because
[39:27] I the more and more I come into Bitcoin
[39:30] the the more and more time I spending
[39:33] Bitcoin and doing Bitcoin even though I
[39:35] have now more freedom financially uh and
[39:40] and otherwise where I could spend more
[39:42] time with friends and probably should
[39:44] spend more time with friends and and
[39:46] other things uh but I'm just like
[39:48] obsessed with Bitcoin because it's just
[39:50] like such a unique 5 to 10 years window
[39:53] right now where we can see that suddenly
[39:55] face all of the sudden actually
[39:57] occurring uh I'm also not a big believer
[40:00] in diminishing returns I think that's I
[40:03] think it's increasing returns from here
[40:05] yeah absolutely especially when you see
[40:07] like we we had like that gradually phase
[40:10] now and we are only such a small amount
[40:12] and we will get here at some point at
[40:14] some point we we have to make that that
[40:17] huge jump it's just like like the timing
[40:20] is is impossible to to time of
[40:23] course yeah sure absolutely really
[40:26] interesting um this year has been
[40:29] also very different from other like I've
[40:32] been in in Bitcoin since around four or
[40:35] five years now and and this year felt
[40:38] quite different uh because it has been
[40:41] so politicized yeah Trump used it and
[40:44] everything like that we have the Bitcoin
[40:45] ETF it has been institutionalized as as
[40:48] never before the the traditional
[40:50] Financial space really comes in it's
[40:53] also interesting to see all the the
[40:55] cnbc's and and the normal is actually
[40:57] talking positive about Bitcoin and the
[40:59] finance channels uh except in Austria
[41:02] but in America definitely changed um how
[41:05] has been the year for you how what what
[41:08] stood out to you for you I think
[41:10] definitely sort of the political
[41:12] rhetoric or you know sort of maybe uh
[41:14] Trump's speech in Nashville RFK Jr's
[41:17] speech in
[41:19] Nashville um a lot of yeah I I didn't
[41:23] Envision it being this big part of the
[41:25] political spear this year
[41:27] year um I think the ETF is a little bit
[41:30] more expected just in terms again I'm
[41:33] not trying to root for ETFs or say ETFs
[41:35] are a better way to manage your Bitcoin
[41:36] anything like that you lose all the
[41:37] qualties of Bitcoin but um I think we
[41:40] were all waiting for Wall Street to
[41:42] financialized bitcoin and uh ETFs make a
[41:45] lot of sense and um you know I the
[41:48] growth was phenomenal I was surprised by
[41:50] again just I think I think the biggest
[41:52] surprise for me again mentioning
[41:54] everything you did I think all that was
[41:56] somewhat expected I didn't except aside
[41:59] from the political sphere and how crazy
[42:01] that got but like none of this seemed to
[42:02] move sort of outside the bubble yet you
[42:06] know you still had sort of uh you know
[42:08] different institutions coming like the
[42:09] ETF players chose to come to the bubble
[42:12] and then other ETF players chose not to
[42:14] right and stay outside and uh who shared
[42:18] it with their customers was a choice it
[42:20] just wasn't everywhere yet and yet you
[42:21] have tremendous price appreciation you
[42:23] have the ETFs you have politicians
[42:25] talking about to the extent they have
[42:27] and yet I felt like the greater
[42:29] atmosphere wasn't moved at all and I
[42:31] think that's very bullish it shows how
[42:32] early we are but I think that was the
[42:34] biggest surprise for me I even said that
[42:37] back at the Canadian Bitcoin conference
[42:38] I think in like April I mean even then
[42:40] you know Bitcoin was up like 40 or 50%
[42:44] for the year and it's on every Ticker on
[42:46] CNBC and yet still Wall Street was still
[42:48] still kind of quiet outside the ETF
[42:50] bubble even um I'm yeah I'm most
[42:53] surprised by how people aren't like the
[42:56] the the the F faces didn't melt this
[43:00] year you know yeah I'm I'm surprised
[43:03] actually like that's also a good point
[43:06] how uh how how few messages uh
[43:11] bitcoiners are getting how few um
[43:13] interest of of retail is actually there
[43:16] even though it's so so big it's also
[43:18] interesting I just saw to data news and
[43:20] and was curious of how the AUST
[43:23] mainstream media is covering the 100K so
[43:26] I was going on there and seeing how they
[43:29] reported and two takeaways I got is like
[43:31] the one Trump alone push Bitcoin to 100K
[43:35] and and because of trump now Bitcoin is
[43:38] there and the second thing is like yeah
[43:40] like consumer production and other
[43:43] institutions say Bitcoin is too volatile
[43:45] it's speculative it's risky and all the
[43:47] things but that that that we hear since
[43:49] since the beginning it kind of gets
[43:50] boring but yeah the Trump was
[43:52] interesting yeah I mean it's I didn't
[43:55] like how much I think I wish it was a
[43:57] little bit more of trump coming to us
[43:58] than I felt that than it was bitcoiners
[44:00] trying to put on a trump thing um I I I
[44:04] think everyone should bend the need of
[44:05] Bitcoin both parties all
[44:08] politicians um and it's been politicized
[44:10] in a weird way like my mother uh I mean
[44:13] lifelong New York City public school
[44:14] teacher very liberal Democrat um and her
[44:18] friends were like and she's a Bitcoin
[44:21] and her friends are like are you um you
[44:23] know a republican now you know and it it
[44:27] it's interesting like how like but I
[44:30] think it's just a sad state of where our
[44:32] society's at you know people with with
[44:35] the political parties and the food
[44:36] fighting and I think it's all kayab and
[44:39] it's fake and I think both parties are
[44:40] ruled by the same people but and then
[44:43] they're using that to pit us against
[44:45] each other and it's just I it's sad the
[44:47] way everyone's taking the bait and for
[44:50] me I think the best thing about Bitcoin
[44:51] maybe this year was being able to remove
[44:53] myself from all that to sort of deoli
[44:57] myself uh I don't root for party I if
[45:01] I'm going to get involved politically I
[45:02] want it to be very local try to look at
[45:04] every issue on its own uh I try not to
[45:06] get caught up in in sort of the you know
[45:09] the class
[45:10] Warfare and uh but it's it's really sad
[45:14] to see how um for non-b bitcoiners
[45:18] they're they're getting caught up in all
[45:20] this and P you know and and Bitcoin it's
[45:23] a shame for them I I hate to see Bitcoin
[45:25] involved in that and and not that
[45:28] Bitcoin cares bitcoin's math I'm not but
[45:30] it's just like it sucks I just wish that
[45:32] Bitcoin was they saw both parties or
[45:35] people in that food fight I just wish
[45:36] they would see Bitcoin in a universal
[45:38] way and one day they will I think um but
[45:40] right now they're using it against each
[45:42] other and their food fights you know and
[45:43] that that kind of annoying especially at
[45:45] Thanksgiving um or things like that do
[45:48] do you think the bitcoiners or or
[45:51] Bitcoin is is too much into politics
[45:53] especially this year well bitcoin's not
[45:55] anything I just think that
[45:57] it's B it's been it's in that
[45:58] conversation a lot and and the people
[46:00] that are political minded like to find
[46:02] like well you must think this because
[46:04] you believe in that and it's a shame
[46:06] bitcoin's in that you know on either
[46:08] side and I don't care I'm not going to
[46:10] get involved in their their their
[46:12] arguments it's like you know don't don't
[46:14] argue with a fool because from far away
[46:16] you know no one could tell who's who so
[46:19] uh you know I'm not going to act to fool
[46:21] with them but like and and argue over
[46:23] these things that are shouldn't be
[46:24] National issues even or or looking
[46:27] looked at that way you know if we want
[46:28] to separate money from State it's not a
[46:30] political thing from a party
[46:32] perspective um you know it's the orange
[46:34] party you know so um but yeah it's it's
[46:38] interesting like my mom likes Bitcoin
[46:40] and to see her friends attack her for it
[46:43] you know or or you know that's what I
[46:44] don't like you know I don't care which
[46:46] way it's coming from it's just that's
[46:48] that sucks um and so it did get into
[46:51] that conversation and I it's a shame
[46:53] people because the political sphere is
[46:56] so uh what is it like um everything is
[46:59] like a quip right so or headline and so
[47:03] no one really goes and reads the article
[47:04] or reads an article critically uh so
[47:07] people get opinions very quickly and um
[47:11] you know sort of uh you know wield these
[47:13] things at each other so
[47:17] um from that perspective I wish that it
[47:19] was less politicized this year you know
[47:22] especially I I felt like um at the
[47:24] Bitcoin conference it was a little too
[47:25] much like a trump rally instead of a
[47:27] Bitcoin rally that Trump had to speak
[47:30] at that that's that's that's good point
[47:33] and so I felt like that was a little out
[47:36] of out of bounds but like you know I I
[47:39] I'm not sure of how you know Bitcoin
[47:42] magazine and and David bail they still
[47:44] pulled off a tremendous feat there I
[47:46] think getting moving the conversation as
[47:48] far as they did and you know you're
[47:51] going to break some eggs probably along
[47:52] the way so who am I to criticize it just
[47:55] but as a as someone who was like oh wow
[47:57] this feels more like a trump rally
[47:58] instead of trump speaking at a Bitcoin
[48:01] rally right like to me it should have
[48:03] felt he should have felt like he needs
[48:05] us not so much like we need him and he
[48:07] still like even his tweet today I think
[48:09] it was on social truth or whatever true
[48:11] social was very much like oh wow Bitcoin
[48:13] reached under K you're welcome or
[48:16] something like that you know very like
[48:17] taking credit for it and even then I
[48:20] think he took a lot of credit for like
[48:21] how well Bitcoin did during his
[48:23] administration even though his
[48:24] administration was very anti- Bitcoin
[48:25] last time
[48:27] you know yeah it's super
[48:29] interesting it's GNA be I mean he's got
[48:31] to release Ross on day one or you know
[48:34] they really should be held to pay uh
[48:35] it's what did he uh he this
[48:38] congratulation wait I can quickly pull
[48:40] it up for for those people that maybe
[48:42] not have seen it uh uh on on the screen
[48:46] let me share that might be interesting
[48:50] he said congratulation Bitcoin is
[48:52] 100,000 you are
[48:55] welcome together we will make America
[48:57] crate again yeah he's definitely taking
[49:00] credit for that and the mainstream media
[49:02] very Trump though so you know I mean
[49:04] it's it's it's in the book it's it's by
[49:06] the book but and it does show that he's
[49:08] he's thinking about it and and maybe
[49:10] that he wants to
[49:11] help you know I'm weary of of sort of
[49:14] that you know maybe the things we're not
[49:17] expecting like or you know I I wonder
[49:19] how much this Administration is going to
[49:20] roll out like a cbdc or something to
[49:23] that effect Andor like digital
[49:25] surveillance and digital ID and national
[49:27] ID and a lot of these things um so that
[49:31] that Still Remains to be seen but I'd
[49:32] like to see him take some positive steps
[49:34] so it's it's good to see he wants to
[49:35] pump the price but I'd really like to
[49:36] see him free raw I think that would be
[49:38] great and I'd like to see him uh
[49:40] eliminate capital gains tax and make
[49:41] Bitcoin legal tender those would be real
[49:44] tangible
[49:45] steps absolutely yeah that that's super
[49:48] interesting and it and it kind of kind
[49:51] of TAPS into maybe even like your your
[49:54] podcast name it's the Matrix uh podcast
[49:58] uh and and I always argue a little bit
[50:00] like um like as you said before like
[50:03] both sides kind of want the same thing
[50:06] they both will spend money they both
[50:07] will like of course there will be
[50:09] changes like if if only Republicans on
[50:12] on the power only Democrats that there
[50:14] might be different changes that you
[50:15] actually experience but like how big are
[50:18] they really how how big is your life
[50:21] changing from that is from there the
[50:23] your name also originating from for your
[50:25] podcast well it kind of comes from the
[50:27] movie The Matrix and sort of uh the idea
[50:31] of like entering or leaving the Fiat M
[50:33] Matrix and living your life in the
[50:35] Bitcoin Matrix or the Bitcoin overlay on
[50:37] a Bitcoin standard and just looking at
[50:39] the world through a Bitcoin lens so I
[50:43] guess the word I used instead of lens
[50:44] there also is Matrix like just you have
[50:46] like you're just looking at the world
[50:48] like it's a it's a matrix but it's a
[50:50] Bitcoin Matrix now um and you're reading
[50:53] the world like that it's basically like
[50:54] using uh Bitcoin as your unit of account
[50:56] and away you know and I I I mean yeah I
[50:59] think that's your like Silver Bullet uh
[51:02] to get through the day get through your
[51:04] day and get through the world um you're
[51:07] going to Value the things that are
[51:08] scarce and there's only three things in
[51:10] the world that are scarce in my opinion
[51:12] Bitcoin time and family you know time is
[51:15] obviously scarce and
[51:16] limited Bitcoin I think we agree there
[51:19] and then family there only so much
[51:21] family you could make even if you were
[51:22] like a degenerate and you know whatever
[51:24] I mean you just you can't make that much
[51:27] family um so you know um it's precious
[51:32] and it's how you value those
[51:35] things absolutely you know and I think
[51:37] that brings up another conversation I
[51:38] think that bit quinters are really
[51:39] debating right now we trying to figure
[51:41] out like you know like uh as I you know
[51:43] there's one I think SE bunny might have
[51:46] was talking about how like if you never
[51:49] intend to ever spend your
[51:51] Bitcoin or I trade it for things like is
[51:55] that is that a
[51:57] mindset you know and you know you won't
[52:00] live forever and you're not even
[52:01] guaranteed tomorrow so you know maybe
[52:04] it's okay to enjoy some of your Bitcoin
[52:06] today with your you know yourself your
[52:08] friends and your loved ones you know and
[52:11] um there's nothing wrong with that you
[52:13] know it's just money it's just a
[52:15] tool you know um you know the whole
[52:18] notion it's like don't buy you know sell
[52:20] your chairs if you want to buy a chair
[52:22] today you could buy 10 you know tomorrow
[52:25] but one day is tomorrow Tom like at some
[52:27] point like you're going to want a chair
[52:29] and you know like do you want you know
[52:31] is it do you need 11 of them do you need
[52:34] 114 of them 1,087 you know like when is
[52:38] enough chairs you know in metaphoric
[52:40] purchase power terms like to go get
[52:43] yourself a chair you know or maybe even
[52:46] the best chair of your you know of your
[52:47] life I don't know go get a nice chair um
[52:50] abely and it kind of comes down like
[52:53] there the spectrum of like you
[52:56] too um High Time preference where you
[52:59] just spend spend spend and like whenever
[53:01] something comes like you just throw
[53:03] money in it the other thing is like you
[53:05] you you kind of downgrade your life so
[53:09] much that the only thing that is good in
[53:11] your life is is your Bitcoin balance
[53:13] sheet and and everything else is kind of
[53:15] like really shitty you eat bad food you
[53:18] you do that like that's like the the two
[53:21] spectrums in finding that healthy
[53:24] balance where you buy things but things
[53:27] that bring value to your life and and
[53:29] and not it I think that that that's the
[53:32] that's a hard part of of it and and I
[53:36] and I hope that Bitcoin pushes us more
[53:38] to the to the healthy side because I
[53:40] feel like we now more at the consuming
[53:42] side but maybe in the Bitcoin Community
[53:44] we we maybe even like on the other side
[53:46] of the spectrum because we have that
[53:49] Bitcoin and it just goes up that much uh
[53:52] and we are in that um unique window of
[53:55] time where you just like want to spend
[53:57] like you and me all the time in Bitcoin
[54:00] making podcast making content because
[54:01] you could miss out of something uh and
[54:04] you also want to don't spend your
[54:06] Bitcoin because uh if if you spend it
[54:09] now a week later it might be already
[54:12] gone at a whole different price level so
[54:14] that that's that's hard now not for
[54:16] Bitcoin yeah I think you know it's like
[54:18] you don't want to confuse maybe like
[54:19] being Frugal or with cheap you know
[54:22] cheap is like uh you never buy anything
[54:24] and you know but Frugal is more like you
[54:26] don't buy the $6 Starbucks so that when
[54:28] you do go to your favorite restaurant
[54:29] you can afford to tip nicely you're not
[54:31] you're not cheap with the tip you know
[54:34] you go to your favorite places and you
[54:36] you you treat people well and you're
[54:38] generous there um but you avoid maybe
[54:41] you know things that you don't need or
[54:43] want or you know or just garbage uh and
[54:45] sort of you know uh whatever uh
[54:48] consumption that's sort of fruitless
[54:50] whatever but you know it's not being
[54:52] cheap it's Frugal or whatever affording
[54:54] you know trying to figure out how to
[54:55] afford the things you want
[54:57] 100% I agree with that um one question
[55:00] that I always ask in the in the podcast
[55:02] every guest uh since since I think like
[55:05] over 200 episodes now what what can we
[55:08] learn from you besides Bitcoin besides
[55:11] Bitcoin wow uh I don't know if I have
[55:14] anything to
[55:16] offer besides I don't know um I I think
[55:20] it's Bitcoin time and family so I mean
[55:22] really you know uh think about your time
[55:25] how you're spending
[55:26] it uh you know something I learned from
[55:30] or not learn I think that saf expressed
[55:32] really well is like you know it's like
[55:33] you're you're looking to meet the right
[55:35] person or something like you know the
[55:37] the step before that is being the right
[55:40] person right so you know becoming the
[55:43] best person you could be you know maybe
[55:45] not uh sitting on your SATs waiting for
[55:47] them to be you know some uh innumerable
[55:50] value one day but just continuing to
[55:52] create value in the world save the
[55:55] Overflow and this Bitcoin will take care
[55:57] of that but like continue to take care
[55:59] of yourself and be productive add more
[56:01] value to the world than you take uh even
[56:04] Helen Keller who was deaf di de dumb and
[56:08] blind found a way to add more value to
[56:10] the world than she
[56:12] consumed you know um so anyone could
[56:15] kind of create in this world and you
[56:18] know work and whatever produce value and
[56:20] then you know take care of your family
[56:22] um build a
[56:25] family uh so yeah I think those are the
[56:28] things that I I who am I to give anyone
[56:30] advice you know especially maybe outside
[56:32] of Bitcoin it's the one thing I speak
[56:33] publicly on you know um so uh you know I
[56:38] think the one of the I think the worst
[56:39] thing about advice is most people tell
[56:41] you what they would have done in your
[56:43] situation or in their own situation when
[56:45] they would have found themselves in that
[56:46] situation and the advice is like nothing
[56:48] to do with
[56:50] you and so maybe you can get something
[56:52] out of it or like apply something from
[56:54] it to your life but like definitely take
[56:56] advice but that you know are they really
[56:58] trying to help you or just like express
[57:00] what they would have done in your shoes
[57:01] that would have been best for them you
[57:03] know so I I'm very hesitant to give
[57:06] people
[57:07] advice um because I don't know what they
[57:09] need or or looking for and I don't know
[57:11] what i' I'd offer but yeah I mean value
[57:14] the things that your life are the most
[57:16] precious and scarce and make the most of
[57:19] those and advice is always with like a a
[57:24] grain of salt to to take and and see if
[57:27] it actually applies to your situation
[57:29] and be a critical thinker about
[57:31] something because you can get from a
[57:33] great person a create advice that just
[57:35] doesn't apply to yourself right that
[57:38] that that that can be true and I felt
[57:40] for that trap a lot of times where like
[57:44] I listen to the right person at the
[57:46] right time I do the right at tce but it
[57:49] it just was not right for me so that
[57:51] that definitely can happen uh a lot of
[57:54] things I I really like
[57:56] um when I enter something new to to see
[58:00] um what where like like where I want to
[58:04] go and and what are those people doing
[58:06] and and maybe that's probably the the
[58:08] best kind of Ace it's but it still
[58:11] doesn't has to apply to you so there's
[58:13] always a grain of salt with that but
[58:15] with that question I I really try to get
[58:18] into the Bitcoin podcast something
[58:20] outside of it and sometimes it even
[58:22] comes in within the the podcast where we
[58:24] talk about whole different things um we
[58:27] had um uh whole episodes around
[58:31] parenting we had whole episodes around
[58:32] other things uh which is really cool uh
[58:36] and uh also interesting to see that the
[58:38] Bitcoin Community really likes that like
[58:40] they usually if you think like you have
[58:42] a podcast with one topic and then you
[58:44] have one episode that falls out of that
[58:46] topic that uh the average through
[58:48] duration The Click through and all the
[58:50] metrics that you can look at will fall
[58:52] down it didn't like it it was average it
[58:55] was good you know because bitcoiners are
[58:57] probably you know they're looking for
[58:59] those I think those sort of Diamonds in
[59:01] the Rough because like they they like
[59:03] what more can I learn about Bitcoin so
[59:04] it's awesome to hear these ideas that
[59:06] are kind of outside of Bitcoin uh you
[59:08] know maybe through a Bitcoin lens maybe
[59:11] you know around sort of though maybe
[59:12] related to bitcoin though but I learned
[59:14] this from Trace mayor but you know track
[59:16] your net worth in dollars in gold and in
[59:20] Bitcoin uh it should be going up in all
[59:22] three but I think you'll learn a lot
[59:24] there and you'll you'll be noticing that
[59:26] your your Bitcoin net worth Will Trend
[59:28] towards the amount of STS you have no
[59:30] matter how many SATs you have over time
[59:32] and that you'll kind of peak in Bitcoin
[59:34] terms at some point um and then you know
[59:38] uh you know maybe to help you think in
[59:40] Bitcoin maybe get something like a block
[59:42] clock you know so that you can kind of
[59:44] think in STS per dollar or block height
[59:47] and other ways to kind of get Bitcoin
[59:49] into your mind uh and think in Bitcoin
[59:52] because thinking in Bitcoin is is is the
[59:55] real superpower that's that's where we
[59:57] want to be uh really cool thank you so
[59:59] much we have endro in the podcast where
[60:02] uh the previous guest is asking a
[60:04] question for the next guest without
[60:05] knowing who the next guest actually is
[60:07] um the question for you is do you think
[60:10] cbdcs will live with Bitcoin in
[60:13] combination or is it either cbdc or
[60:16] Bitcoin oh they'll definitely be I think
[60:18] parallel and I think cbdc is kind of
[60:20] already exist you can maybe call tether
[60:22] a cbdc or PayPal a
[60:24] cbdc um I think there'll be continued
[60:27] mations of cbdcs and I think that cbdcs
[60:30] and stable coins is what I think they'll
[60:32] really be will live us long time
[60:35] alongside uh Bitcoin until fi
[60:37] dies really cool uh the the I hope that
[60:42] we come to that Bitcoin world as as soon
[60:45] as possible maybe I see it in my
[60:47] lifetime let's see how how fast we we
[60:50] get there yeah thank you so much cetric
