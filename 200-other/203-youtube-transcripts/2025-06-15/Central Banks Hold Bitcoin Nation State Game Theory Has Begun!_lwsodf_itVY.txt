[00:00] we are still amongst the early adopters
[00:02] who figured this thing out what did You
[00:05] observe with the 100K number a lot of
[00:07] people being excessively happy and
[00:10] probably forgetting Odell's famous
[00:12] saying stay humble and stack SATs if you
[00:14] look at the Basic Marketing funnel the
[00:17] AA model attention interest desire
[00:19] action the price is perfect for
[00:21] attention who is not drawn to a big
[00:24] number if you've been in Bitcoin long
[00:25] enough and you've been like laughed at
[00:27] and mocked by like friends and family
[00:29] because you're this crazy person the
[00:31] only one in Bitcoin when the price
[00:32] actually goes up it's a sense of
[00:34] vindication when you go to the Post
[00:36] Office you can buy Bitcoin at the post
[00:39] office you can buy Bitcoin on the train
[00:41] station platforms uh the Swiss National
[00:43] Bank has exposure to bitcoin but it's
[00:46] just not overtly
[00:48] [Music]
[00:52] pronounced I was you know drawn to
[00:54] bitcoin because of what it meant with
[00:57] respect to Central Banking and and
[01:00] personal freedom like real Financial
[01:02] Freedom and sovereignty and stuff so I
[01:04] naturally gravitate towards that but I
[01:06] have to say that uh since this whole
[01:09] Resurgence of you know uh a fork and
[01:11] Bitcoin with black rock I reread the
[01:13] blocksize wars and so the the sort of
[01:16] the psychology aspect of things and how
[01:18] people behave in groups and what how
[01:20] they interpret Bitcoin that also
[01:23] interests me love that I think we can
[01:25] directly uh jump into with that with
[01:28] black gr on the psychology beh behind
[01:30] that and a possible Fork uh that is
[01:32] always discussed I personally hope and
[01:35] don't think so that it will happen U but
[01:37] it's a possibility how do you see that
[01:39] is is that something that actually is in
[01:41] your mind was like maybe blackr actually
[01:44] tries to do something with I don't know
[01:46] widen the block space widen the supply
[01:48] or something like that well I mean so
[01:52] I'm not Larry I don't work for Black
[01:54] Rock I've met people who work for Black
[01:58] Rock um but I don't know what firstly
[02:02] the incentive would be and I actually
[02:05] got into a back and forth with a guy on
[02:07] Twitter who will come on the podcast and
[02:10] amongst the 21 questions I will ask him
[02:12] questions about like Bitcoin XT Bitcoin
[02:15] unlimited all of these proposals that
[02:17] came during the the quote unquote
[02:20] blocksize Wars but I don't know what
[02:22] their incentive would be and so let's
[02:24] say they do have a legitimate
[02:27] incentive what are the resources
[02:29] required ired in order to firstly so
[02:32] make the fork happen that's not too
[02:34] difficult but to actually maintain this
[02:39] you know I mean so one person was saying
[02:42] it would be like a proof of stake Fork
[02:44] as opposed to proof of work okay so you
[02:46] don't need all of the mining
[02:48] infrastructure in place because it would
[02:50] be a staking model I guess they would
[02:52] just sort of copypaste what ethereum has
[02:54] I don't know I don't know that much
[02:56] about ethereum I stopped paying
[02:57] attention to it a long time ago but but
[03:00] I would just my my biggest thing would
[03:03] be why would they want to fork and how
[03:06] much money
[03:07] resources uh influencer influencers
[03:10] because that was the other thing too
[03:12] like you need to get people who are I
[03:15] guess are credible in the Bitcoin space
[03:17] to persuade other bitcoiners to move
[03:19] over to this new token and then I'm like
[03:22] but any bitcoiner who runs a node is not
[03:24] going to go over to proof of stake like
[03:26] you know what I mean there may be an in
[03:28] between there may be a sense of holding
[03:30] the tokens just to see what happens
[03:32] because most of us are curious and I
[03:34] guess there's more of a sort of
[03:36] pragmatic or scientific approach what
[03:38] actually happens with this experiment
[03:40] but I can't I I don't know how that
[03:42] could happen so and it's an interesting
[03:44] one with like group psychology because I
[03:48] think the bitcoiner crowd is the hardest
[03:51] to pay out it's the hardest one to pay
[03:56] like what will uh black HW do they
[03:59] obviously will try to pay influencers to
[04:02] advertise for their things uh but I feel
[04:05] like bitcoiners are the worst possible
[04:08] people you can try to do that like
[04:10] they're most principled they're they're
[04:12] really hard they're really about the
[04:14] small details even if you are high
[04:16] signal Bitcoin Maxi there will be a
[04:19] bitcoiner that criticize you for small
[04:22] behaviors I I speak from
[04:25] experience I got I I got roasted uh
[04:28] yesterday actually from Adam back uh
[04:31] first of all I feel so humbled and
[04:34] honored that he even watches my
[04:36] podcast that's amazing yeah that that
[04:39] that that amazed me but he roasted me
[04:42] for not staying on the topic and being
[04:45] too hyper bullish in the podcast in one
[04:47] episode like even if you are a high
[04:50] signal Bitcoin Maxi you still get
[04:52] attacked from all sorts of angles um so
[04:55] it's interesting how this group
[04:57] psychology thing could could work out
[04:59] and um what what is it maybe interesting
[05:03] one how do you see the group psychology
[05:05] and the the Bitcoin crowd this uh cyber
[05:08] hornet nest uh from from your
[05:11] perspective well
[05:14] so I I live in Switzerland and here um
[05:19] there is like at the I used to organize
[05:23] and plan and invite guests to speak at
[05:25] the Meetup here in Geneva and within the
[05:28] group itself there are a few of us who
[05:31] are like Bitcoin Maxis there are quite a
[05:34] few I would say I don't know if this is
[05:36] the proper term if you see this don't
[05:37] kill me but I would say they're more
[05:39] technologists in that they really look
[05:42] at experimentation and so they will see
[05:45] another chain as an opportunity to learn
[05:48] um some if they work specifically and
[05:51] they're remu remunerated sorry for a
[05:54] project they will maybe push that
[05:56] project forward because they have
[05:57] incentive to do so but I live in a
[06:00] context that is quite diverse if you
[06:03] will from a like I don't know blockchain
[06:07] perspective they're things that I don't
[06:08] like so I don't participate in them and
[06:11] so my perspective is what I see here and
[06:15] it's also like Bitcoin Twitter and
[06:17] Noster and Bitcoin Twitter is a world
[06:21] within itself where I find that the
[06:24] focus is a lot on price as opposed to um
[06:28] anything else and then I a few people
[06:30] who run nodes like one of the first um
[06:34] actually she's a woman uh that I met
[06:35] within the Bitcoin space is not active
[06:38] on Twitter she's been in Bitcoin since
[06:40] like 2015 or 2016 she's very like
[06:43] low-key like I would call her like a
[06:45] true Bitcoin maximalist you don't know
[06:48] who she is she runs her nodes she helps
[06:50] people in real life and so I think it's
[06:53] really difficult to get a sense of you
[06:57] know what the real group psychology is
[07:01] there's the Twitter psychology and then
[07:03] you move over to Noster and the
[07:05] psychology is a little bit different um
[07:08] I think a year ago I started posting
[07:10] more regularly on Instagram because I
[07:12] want you know just to promote my my
[07:15] podcast and that psychology is different
[07:17] as well so it'll be difficult it's
[07:21] difficult to narrow it down but I do see
[07:24] a split between people who are like
[07:27] number go up sort of Maxis who are
[07:29] really really rallying for the price and
[07:32] people who are really grounded in self-
[07:37] sovereignty it's also interesting when
[07:39] we look at the different platforms
[07:41] because I feel like even the same person
[07:44] acts different friendly when they are on
[07:46] rer versus when they are on X versus
[07:49] when they are on YouTube um because the
[07:51] formats are also different I mean ax and
[07:54] Nostra might be similar from um from the
[07:58] raw for
[08:00] but still the content is quite different
[08:02] there and the speed of it is also quite
[08:04] different there and the
[08:05] algorithm algorithm is the big thing
[08:08] that that is probably different but I
[08:10] see a lot of different comments on
[08:13] YouTube versus on Twitter on Twitter
[08:16] it's way more aggressive or way more
[08:18] short
[08:20] uh let's say shortsighted and on YouTube
[08:23] they are way more intense and and little
[08:26] bit more because the people usually
[08:27] actually watch the whole thing to
[08:29] comment and on Twitter they usually
[08:31] didn't watch it which is an
[08:33] interesting phom yeah but the the the
[08:37] focus on Price is interesting how how
[08:39] important is it for you to to to see the
[08:43] Bitcoin price maybe as a marketing tool
[08:45] for Bitcoin well it's an excellent
[08:47] marketing tool it's an excellent um um
[08:50] attention grabbing pool like if you look
[08:52] at the Basic Marketing funnel the AA
[08:55] model attention interest desire action
[08:58] the price is like perfect for attention
[09:00] I mean who is not drawn to like a big
[09:03] number or a big shiny object and I think
[09:06] that it's it's probably healthy to
[09:08] acknowledge that aspect of human nature
[09:10] and not to be like Oh I'm only in it for
[09:13] the technology and then from a very
[09:15] pragmatic uh perspective if you've been
[09:17] in Bitcoin long enough and you've been
[09:19] saving in Bitcoin long enough and you've
[09:22] been like laughed at and mocked by like
[09:24] friends and family because you're this
[09:25] crazy person the only one in Bitcoin
[09:28] when the price actually goes up it's a
[09:30] sense of vindication like I think that
[09:32] is a natural feeling that a lot of
[09:34] people have and that said it's like
[09:37] finding the ability to step back and not
[09:40] get too taken away by the price because
[09:43] then if someone or like an entity like
[09:46] black rock or whoever else will exist in
[09:48] the future comes along and dangles like
[09:51] your number in front of you what you
[09:53] actually do and so it's it's just I
[09:56] think it's a balancing game and I think
[09:59] that this is a um for people who were in
[10:02] Bitcoin a long time ago when it hit
[10:04] $20,000 us I think that that was a big
[10:08] moment and so for some of us who who
[10:11] came along a bit later after it hit that
[10:14] that uh pivotal number 100,000 is
[10:18] another level of psychology and it's
[10:21] just I like to observe how people uh
[10:24] react to it and how people
[10:26] behave what what did you uh observe with
[10:30] the 100K
[10:31] number a lot of people being excessively
[10:35] happy and
[10:37] probably forgetting Odell's famous
[10:40] saying stay humble and stack STS which
[10:42] is again understandable like when you've
[10:44] been made fun of for quite some time
[10:47] about your crazy internet money it does
[10:49] feel really good and so it's like you
[10:51] know you want to pull back or like with
[10:53] Justin Trudeau you know I'm C I'm
[10:56] Canadian I was born in Toronto and when
[10:59] I saw him a few years ago mock uh PV who
[11:03] is the conservative leader for actually
[11:06] speaking about Bitcoin to the Canadian
[11:08] public I thought like that is just
[11:12] that's that's below the belt you know
[11:13] instead of educating people you're going
[11:15] to make fun of it and so you know here
[11:17] we fast forward a few years he finally
[11:20] resigns and Bitcoin is rallying over
[11:23] 100k like you know what I mean so it's
[11:25] just it's the balance and the the the
[11:27] the ability for sell to just take a step
[11:30] back and say s like don't get too
[11:32] carried away you're happy this is
[11:34] actually happening it's factual it's
[11:36] documented and then just go back to like
[11:38] studying and learning it's interesting
[11:40] how the prize can be like an
[11:42] confirmation that we are right even
[11:44] though the hardcore bitcoiners are not
[11:48] focused on the price they're like like
[11:50] we don't care about the price but it
[11:52] still is like a confirmation it's it's
[11:54] almost like a scoreboard of how bad the
[11:57] US dollar is doing because it's it shows
[12:01] how the US dollar is devaluing against
[12:04] the Bitcoin price so maybe maybe that's
[12:06] more of the sign of the Bitcoin US
[12:09] dollar Price Less on the value of
[12:12] Bitcoin and more on the devaluing of of
[12:15] of the US dollar maybe that's the right
[12:17] way to look at it yeah and also uh a
[12:21] certain type of adoption which type of
[12:24] Market participants are starting to
[12:26] adopt because again I mean like spoken
[12:29] to very professional private Bankers
[12:32] whatever about Bitcoin I mean I remember
[12:35] telling a former colleague um 2017 or
[12:38] 2018 I was like you should really like
[12:40] look into Bitcoin you know and he went
[12:43] to his private banker and said oh you
[12:45] know I had a meeting with him and then
[12:47] we had coffee like a few days later and
[12:49] he's like oh I spoke to my banker about
[12:51] Bitcoin and you know he said it's really
[12:53] not a good idea and so you have these
[12:56] like where your reputation really does
[12:59] take a hit at a certain point and so the
[13:02] price also reflects larger institutions
[13:05] that were once Dead Set against Bitcoin
[13:08] I think Larry think referred to it as
[13:10] you know just you know a technology for
[13:12] bad people or for money launderers drug
[13:15] dealers whatever bad person you want to
[13:18] like you know attribute to to bitcoin
[13:21] and so now you see this turnaround and
[13:23] so you know I guess price is it's deeper
[13:26] than just the number for some of us I've
[13:29] lost yourself sorry uh now now I have a
[13:32] I have a um mute button on my side and
[13:34] sometimes I forget to unmute myself okay
[13:38] it it happens like every 30th episode or
[13:40] something like
[13:42] that um I was just thinking uh it's like
[13:45] when you go to uh when you go to a bank
[13:49] and ask him about Bitcoin it's a little
[13:51] bit to like you you're going in the
[13:54] early 1900s to someone that sells you
[13:56] horses and carriages and ask him oh what
[13:59] do you think about the car obviously he
[14:01] he probably doesn't like it because it
[14:04] cuts his his market share uh and the
[14:07] same thing is for me with with banks and
[14:09] Bitcoin it's
[14:11] like you shouldn't go to the oldum
[14:14] system to ask him oh what do you think
[14:16] about the new thing what do you think
[14:18] about that so it's it's a logical thing
[14:21] but I actually see another I'm curious
[14:23] about uh probably this in the in Swiss
[14:26] it's probably even more so I saw in
[14:28] Germany even Banks getting on boarded to
[14:32] to the Bitcoin especially uh the FKS
[14:35] bank is is really big on on bitcoin and
[14:37] they're selling it they are cing for you
[14:40] they're having events with over thousand
[14:42] bitcoiners there uh this year it will be
[14:44] really fun also oh the bank in Germany
[14:47] is doing that yes a German Bank like a
[14:50] traditional German bank that it's here
[14:52] for like hundreds of years like it's a
[14:54] really big one uh and they are having
[14:58] events they are doing educational
[15:00] seminars you can book uh really Bitcoin
[15:03] education there which is good education
[15:05] like Bitcoin not crypto education uh not
[15:08] against Bitcoin they they're having
[15:11] Partnerships with with Bitcoin only
[15:13] exchanges like 21 Bitcoin in Austria uh
[15:16] so they they are really like that's the
[15:19] most bullish bank that I have seen uh
[15:22] but I'm curious if there's something
[15:23] like that in Swiss because Swiss in in
[15:26] general is more bullish on bitcoin than
[15:29] than Germany I would say well so
[15:32] Switzerland is um it's the Confederation
[15:35] right and it's separated into what is it
[15:38] 26 cantons I learned this for my
[15:40] citizenship test which I took a few
[15:43] years ago I had everything memorized but
[15:45] we have uh four different official
[15:48] languages
[15:50] and I personally as so I'm swiss but I'm
[15:54] respectful to the fact that I didn't go
[15:56] through the educational system so I
[15:58] still believe that I view Switzerland
[16:00] through the lens of a foreigner and from
[16:04] my foreign lens I see significant
[16:07] differences between the German speaking
[16:10] part of Switzerland the Italian speaking
[16:12] part of Switzerland the French speaking
[16:15] part of Switzerland I live in Geneva
[16:18] which is um and my Village is actually
[16:21] right on the border with France and so
[16:24] we have a lot of uh they're called Le
[16:26] front so people who who live in France
[16:29] and work in Switzerland like there's a
[16:31] lot of free flowing exchange between uh
[16:34] Geneva and France and I I see that I can
[16:39] feel the French influence here even
[16:41] though it's Switzerland very Swiss on
[16:43] many things but with respect to Bitcoin
[16:47] in particular in Geneva I feel as though
[16:50] there's a little more reluctance from
[16:52] like the bcge for example the um the
[16:55] cantonal Bank of Geneva compared to Zug
[16:59] Zurich uh I think lcan bound so while in
[17:04] like the the German speaking parts of
[17:06] Switzerland and to Chino the Italian
[17:08] speaking part of Switzerland where you
[17:10] have the the plan B conference they are
[17:13] very opened and embracing it the zoo
[17:16] cantonal Bank offers Services Etc in
[17:19] Geneva we're not quite there yet like
[17:22] it's like it's almost as though they're
[17:23] holding on to the traditional uh
[17:25] Financial uh system for as long as
[17:27] possible
[17:29] interesting um how do you see in general
[17:32] the the the Swiss people getting on to
[17:35] bitcoin I feel like they have more of
[17:37] this sound money principle in them they
[17:38] have more about this private banking um
[17:41] we're not part of this global banking
[17:44] system we want to have secure our bank
[17:47] Secrets all and stuff like that they
[17:49] they seem to be more ready for Bitcoin
[17:51] than than the rest of
[17:53] Europe yeah I would say that the
[17:56] foundation the low time preference
[17:59] mindset is far more present here than
[18:02] any of the other like 30 or 40 countries
[18:04] that I've visited um I think Switzerland
[18:07] is one of the last countries to actually
[18:09] leave the gold standard and I do believe
[18:11] they did so because they had to adopt to
[18:14] the other Fiat currencies that were just
[18:16] sort of doing their own thing and so the
[18:19] the the foundation is here I know people
[18:22] who still very much advocate for and
[18:25] believe in Gold like middle class people
[18:28] as a as a store of value and this
[18:31] country also when I moved here in 2008 I
[18:36] think that was the last year of the
[18:38] Swiss um uh banking secrecy um I
[18:42] remember you know because I do have a
[18:44] Fiat account my banker calling me saying
[18:46] you need to come to the office like
[18:48] right now and sign a paper to attest
[18:50] that you are not American because there
[18:53] was a a big shakeup you know in one of a
[18:56] like one of the fundamental I guess
[18:58] value oppositions that Swiss banking
[19:00] offered to people which was banking
[19:03] secrecy um so that business exited
[19:06] Switzerland I think Delaware the state
[19:08] of Delaware picked up some of that
[19:09] business but um but everything is here
[19:13] for it to happen and um like Eve benim
[19:17] the guy who's leading the initiative to
[19:20] uh add Bitcoin to the Swiss Constitution
[19:22] like he mentioned when you go to the
[19:25] Post Office you can actually buy um
[19:29] um card wallets you can buy Bitcoin at
[19:31] the post office you can buy Bitcoin on
[19:34] the train station platforms so the state
[19:37] is involved uh the Swiss National Bank
[19:40] um has exposure to bitcoin companies the
[19:43] state is involved but it's just not um
[19:47] from a government perspective it's just
[19:49] not overtly pronounced but there there
[19:51] are signs and there's evidence
[19:53] everywhere banks are are are involved
[19:56] with Bitcoin companies is it micro
[19:58] strategy or where are they involved the
[20:00] Swiss National Bank yeah again Eve uh
[20:03] cuz he did a lot of homework and a lot
[20:05] of digging especially when he came to
[20:07] present at our Meetup here in Geneva um
[20:10] when you go to the Swiss National Banks
[20:13] uh website you'll just see like active
[20:15] passive like you'll see their um assets
[20:17] and liabilities but you don't see in
[20:20] detail what they hold however because of
[20:24] disclosure laws in the US when you go
[20:27] you can actually see who holds what
[20:29] shares and so through um American
[20:32] legislation people living in Switzerland
[20:34] are able to see what parts of what the
[20:37] Swiss National Bank holds and they hold
[20:40] exposure to micro strategy they hold
[20:42] positions in Bitcoin mining companies
[20:44] and that's how you know one person or a
[20:47] few people uncovered it told the rest of
[20:49] us and the rest of us go and look and
[20:50] say oh yeah it's there it's interesting
[20:53] is that I don't know if if you know the
[20:56] intentions of that but is is that part
[20:59] of a global diversification strategy of
[21:03] just like let's let's pick as many
[21:05] different stocks as possible or you
[21:07] think that might even be a targeted of
[21:10] like hey let's get secretly a little bit
[21:12] of Bitcoin exposure uh and uh just but
[21:17] not buying directly Bitcoin with it
[21:19] because micro strategy is also in a lot
[21:22] of like nastic 100 and stuff like that
[21:25] so it could be also just like a
[21:26] diversification strategy of them
[21:29] well micro strategy I do believe was
[21:31] only recently added to the NASDAQ 100
[21:35] and the SNB held Bitcoin before that so
[21:38] I'm not sure and the SNB could actually
[21:41] hold Bitcoin and no one knows because as
[21:44] we know Bitcoin is not centralized we
[21:46] can't just go to like uh you know um the
[21:50] like the sec's website and see you know
[21:53] what the Holdings are so maybe they do
[21:55] hold it we don't know but um I can only
[21:57] speculate
[21:59] and I do think that the people who work
[22:03] for the swis National Bank are competent
[22:06] I do think that they have probably
[22:08] inherited that sort of sound money low
[22:12] time preference Legacy that Switzerland
[22:15] holds and so I would not be surprised if
[22:19] you know they you know behind closed
[22:22] doors said this whole Fiat thing is not
[22:26] working out so well we see what happen
[22:28] or what is happening with our neighbors
[22:31] uh who use the eurocurrency we see
[22:33] what's happening we saw what happened to
[22:35] Greece we see that you know the French
[22:38] uh government is seriously in debt we
[22:41] see all of these things so maybe if we
[22:44] have a small portion allocated to
[22:46] bitcoin it can't hurt you know it's not
[22:48] going to move the needle no one's going
[22:50] to know who knows that's only my
[22:53] speculation it's interesting uh it's I
[22:56] would love to see the Swiss B being one
[22:59] of the first ones the Swiss National
[23:01] Bank being one of the first ones to
[23:03] actually adopt and embrace Bitcoin it's
[23:06] a natural fit for them uh and it would
[23:10] be a good one uh but yeah maybe some
[23:13] other National Bank is is before that I
[23:15] want to show you something because of
[23:18] the 100K that we talked before and and
[23:21] uh maybe a little bit of retail because
[23:23] I think that's really interesting as at
[23:25] least for
[23:26] me uh I
[23:28] like to look at Google Trends because it
[23:30] kind of gives you a feeling of of of
[23:33] where retail is kind of at and uh we see
[23:37] here Bitcoin search term over the last
[23:39] let's say 12 months it is uh and we do
[23:42] have a a significant Spike uh here uh
[23:48] when Bitcoin reached the 100K uh in in
[23:51] that area I don't know exactly the date
[23:53] but somewhere along those lines here it
[23:55] reached 100K obviously there was a spike
[23:58] but then if we actually zoom out five
[24:01] years this Spike looks very small
[24:05] compared to the ones that were happening
[24:07] in
[24:08] 2021 uh and we have now already uh not
[24:13] only uh an significantly higher price
[24:16] but also when you because they're new
[24:18] Bitcoin added if you look at the market
[24:20] cap it's even bigger than that so
[24:22] there's way more financial power in
[24:24] there um for me this is a little bit of
[24:27] the and it's even like
[24:29] we hit the 100K but then the the retail
[24:32] is even like less and less interested
[24:34] and it kind of mirrors what I see right
[24:37] now in in the the general population
[24:40] outside of the Bitcoin crowd they don't
[24:42] really care about the 100K like I got
[24:45] some messages but not not not really a
[24:47] lot I don't know um first like how how
[24:50] was your reaction from outside of
[24:52] bitcoiners to to that 100K and and what
[24:56] do you think uh moving forward that will
[24:58] be is that just like do we need 200k to
[25:00] get the retail masses EXC side out of
[25:02] bought Bitcoin you know what um so the
[25:07] spike happened during covid where people
[25:11] were
[25:12] inside and figuring things out you know
[25:16] what's going on uh some people in Canada
[25:19] I know of took um was it call the pp PPP
[25:24] or PPE Loan in Canada like some people
[25:27] took advantage um not just in Canada and
[25:29] Switzerland as well of the money that
[25:32] the government was handing out and so
[25:35] part of that Spike yes it could be
[25:37] attributed to price but it could also be
[25:40] attributed to all of that extra money
[25:42] that was being given out to
[25:44] people today um after covid from my
[25:48] observation of the people around me I
[25:51] think people on a personal level are
[25:53] sort of dealing with the fallouts of
[25:56] covid that could be separation that
[25:59] could be divorce that could be other
[26:01] problems that ensued because they were
[26:02] cramped together and also the Fallout of
[26:05] having to pay back some of that money
[26:07] that the government probably should not
[26:10] have handed out to people and so the
[26:13] interest or the the the the decrease in
[26:16] interest that we see may not only be
[26:19] about Bitcoin and so I don't know uh
[26:21] your personal situation I W ask but
[26:24] amongst like amongst my peers you know
[26:26] we're we're married we have kids and
[26:29] stuff and so real life is in full swing
[26:32] if you will and I think that that's
[26:34] amongst like I guess my demographic or
[26:37] my segment could be sort of hindering
[26:40] the interest or the time dedicated to
[26:43] Googling Bitcoin and learning more about
[26:45] Bitcoin yeah that's an interesting point
[26:48] I I think it's interesting because when
[26:50] you look at my YouTube analytics my
[26:53] average viewer is around 50 years old
[26:57] between 45 and 50 I have and then tell
[27:00] this all the time I have three times
[27:02] more viewers above 65 than under my own
[27:05] age under 26 uh so my viewers are
[27:08] actually quite on the on the uh way
[27:12] older than than myself which is usually
[27:15] not the not the case usually if you're a
[27:17] content creator you usually have like
[27:19] around your age group or under your
[27:21] because you're role model and stuff that
[27:23] that's definitely not the case are you a
[27:25] role
[27:26] model uh I don't think
[27:29] so no no no but I I'm like usually if
[27:33] you have like content graders you
[27:34] usually have like a younger crowd
[27:36] listening to the content creator and
[27:39] they are putting him as like a role
[27:41] model in in whatever he's doing
[27:43] especially on YouTube because YouTube is
[27:45] also a lot of like how to do things or
[27:48] how to get better like whatever uh so in
[27:51] that case YouTube is definitely some uh
[27:53] my YouTube channel is definitely
[27:54] different um what my point was here is
[27:58] is like the the the younger crowd the J
[28:01] Chen C that I am also belonging to seems
[28:04] to be more interested in crypto
[28:05] gamblings
[28:07] anyways than in
[28:09] Bitcoin uh but that's just like
[28:11] subjective feeling um and also uh I
[28:14] didn't do that before I was just curious
[28:16] while you were speaking to to see what
[28:18] the
[28:19] 2017 uh rise were looking like and this
[28:22] even crazier I I wasn't aware that it
[28:25] was that crazy I I I still feel like we
[28:28] we have um I just wanted to build it up
[28:30] because I still feel like we have we
[28:32] haven't seen what
[28:35] retail
[28:36] um retail form really looks like I think
[28:40] we we're not in a in a mode where retail
[28:42] form really kicks in but yeah I was just
[28:44] curious how you see the the 100K um
[28:47] because I was really disappointed with
[28:49] the the reactions to to that outside of
[28:51] the Bitcoin crowd yeah it's it's it's
[28:55] weird and again like you know amongst
[28:58] the people I know Common well recurring
[29:01] themes are yeah really family uh
[29:04] security which involves money and stuff
[29:06] and for my I I don't want to sound
[29:09] pejorative or mean but for my like
[29:11] Normie friends who are not into Bitcoin
[29:13] every time I mention it they're like be
[29:16] quiet and I'm thinking to myself like I
[29:20] mean I mean it it the answer it's right
[29:23] there in front of you it's right there
[29:26] and just
[29:28] I don't know I I don't know and I've um
[29:32] because I think I've been in this my
[29:34] wonderful bubble for so long I don't
[29:37] understand what competes with you know
[29:42] with the security aspect with Financial
[29:45] Security with respect to bitcoin I'm
[29:47] exposed to a lot of things and I just
[29:49] don't understand you know what you would
[29:51] rather learn about or where you'd rather
[29:54] invest your money in I I don't get it I
[29:57] pop up with coin vigilante this is the
[30:01] most beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I

[32:09] like once you get Bitcoin is like what
[32:11] would I sell it for it's like yeah like
[32:14] BR would you sell at like 200k and like
[32:17] like what for like I don't know what to
[32:19] buy
[32:20] [Laughter]
[32:22] anymore that's a really good position to
[32:24] be in like that is that's Nirvana
[32:28] when you have like your your your needs
[32:31] satisfied and you think I don't know
[32:33] what I would sell this for I really
[32:35] don't know absolutely yeah it's like uh
[32:38] my income is paying for my life that's
[32:41] that's good I can even save from that so
[32:44] I don't need to take out anything from a
[32:47] Bitcoin savings to buy anything fancy
[32:49] because I have everything that I really
[32:51] want uh and then anything above that is
[32:55] like okay where can I put my money
[32:57] elsewhere
[32:58] bonds stocks real estate I mean I mean
[33:02] maybe if like a really small portion of
[33:05] my Bitcoins wants buy me my dream house
[33:07] maybe I'm tempted to like like 10% of my
[33:10] Bitcoin stack buys me the dream house I
[33:12] ever wanted and then never have to take
[33:14] out credit for that I might be tempted
[33:17] to do that uh but that that I think that
[33:21] right now that's far
[33:23] away but yeah let's see um you mentioned
[33:26] you're from Canada and you also
[33:27] mentioned Trudeau uh stepped back I
[33:30] think that was not that was really quite
[33:32] recently right uh the official so rumors
[33:36] started
[33:37] to swirl when Christia Freeland the
[33:41] Finance Minister resigned and she
[33:44] basically Set Fire to the party with the
[33:46] her resignation letter uh and then uh I
[33:49] think on Sunday or something there were
[33:52] reports saying that he would likely
[33:53] resign this week and yesterday Monday he
[33:57] gave his is resignation
[33:59] speech interesting uh that that's
[34:03] something I think a lot of Bitcoin
[34:05] are had before it seems like um uh it's
[34:11] it's the year it's it's too much
[34:12] politics last year it was but for me but
[34:15] uh how do you look at because we are now
[34:17] just 13 days away from the inauguration
[34:19] of Donald Trump uh there are a lot of
[34:21] rumors of him signing an executive order
[34:24] at like day one two three of of the SP
[34:28] as strategic Bitcoin Reserve um how do
[34:31] you look at nation state game theory uh
[34:33] the different kind of governments moving
[34:36] in different directions um what what do
[34:39] you see there um I think that it's
[34:42] playing out pretty like in a very
[34:45] fascinating way I don't like politics I
[34:48] do pay attention however to policies
[34:50] that affect my family that affect me um
[34:53] and it's from a very personal level it's
[34:56] very surreal because I remember Max
[34:59] Kaiser talking about this like almost 10
[35:01] years ago saying that nation state fomo
[35:04] would happen one day that this game
[35:06] theory would play out and we're actually
[35:08] seeing it play out and if I think of um
[35:12] like if I zoom out a little bit more
[35:15] it's playing out under or uh against a
[35:18] backdrop where you also have the whole
[35:20] bricks and multi emergent multi-polar
[35:23] world and they're looking for their own
[35:26] currency uh to conduct trade in and
[35:28] stuff so it's a really fascinating and
[35:31] spectacular time to be alive to not be
[35:34] directly involved but to sit on the
[35:36] sidelines and observe what happens um I
[35:40] would really like to see if this um spr
[35:43] the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve actually
[35:45] goes through to see whether Donald Trump
[35:48] will actually you know follow through on
[35:51] what he said he will do and then how
[35:53] things play out because um I'm not one
[35:57] to sort of get caught up with individual
[36:00] politicians and stuff because they're
[36:02] human and as humans we make mistakes
[36:05] were tempted and stuff but I do think
[36:09] that if this were to go through and also
[36:13] specifically in the US if laws were a
[36:16] little more friendly with respect to
[36:18] being able to use Bitcoin as a medium of
[36:20] exchange without being tax and stuff I I
[36:22] really think that it could help the
[36:24] average American you know my counterpart
[36:27] is in the US live a more prosperous and
[36:30] full life you know lower their time
[36:32] preference and I do think that that that
[36:35] will contribute to improvements within
[36:38] Society interesting yeah I it's I love
[36:42] your perspective on you don't watch
[36:43] politics you watch the policies that
[36:46] affect your family I resonate with that
[36:49] a lot that that's really cool um I have
[36:52] one question that I actually wanted to
[36:54] almost ask in the beginning I kind of
[36:56] forgot about that um you have an
[36:57] interesting show with 21 questions that
[37:00] you ask a bitcoiner within 10 minutes um
[37:04] what are your favorite questions to ask
[37:06] and how many uh episodes did you do
[37:09] already like how many uh people you have
[37:11] you on uh I've done I want to say 25 or
[37:14] 26 episodes um so far I started in April
[37:19] um and the scheduling isn't like like
[37:22] lock down as it should be like yours is
[37:25] um and I actually
[37:29] I guess I like the more sort
[37:31] of human questions because the technical
[37:34] questions I throw some in there like I
[37:36] asked one guy about the pon distribution
[37:38] and how it relates to uh you know um how
[37:42] long it takes for blocks to be minded
[37:43] and stuff but I actually like the
[37:45] questions that cause people to to sort
[37:48] of debate whether they want to answer it
[37:51] quickly so that they get within the
[37:52] 10-minute frame or whether they want to
[37:54] like go full out and really Express
[37:56] themselves I like to see the the
[37:59] reaction in the back and forth that that
[38:01] they go through and that's amazing by
[38:03] the way congratulations with 24 five
[38:06] episodes you are officially now in the
[38:08] top 1% of podcasts oh no way really yeah
[38:12] yeah like uh there's a lot of Statistics
[38:14] I mean there are different statistics
[38:16] out there but generally speaking uh if
[38:19] you have a podcast uh and you done more
[38:22] than three episodes you're in the top 3%
[38:25] already of of the three yeah yeah most
[38:28] podcast most podcast most podcasters I
[38:32] don't know if you can call yourself a
[38:34] podcaster if you have done two episodes
[38:36] uh but most of them quit after three
[38:39] episodes uh and then almost all of them
[38:43] had quit after 20 episodes so if you
[38:45] have done 21 episodes or more uh you're
[38:49] already in the top 1% just because most
[38:52] quit to this point wow uh which is I
[38:55] think an interesting uh inside in the
[38:58] proof of work that it takes to do uh a
[39:01] podcast and the more you do uh and
[39:03] especially if you approach the 100 the
[39:05] 500 thousand that then you're really
[39:07] approaching almost Elite levels because
[39:10] you think there are a lot of podcasts
[39:11] out there and even in my one year that
[39:14] and one over one year now I have seen
[39:16] Bitcoin podcast start and already die
[39:20] again even in my one uh year and two
[39:24] months that I'm doing it now so uh the
[39:27] the thing is not to stop and the hard
[39:29] thing is to keep going so uh already
[39:31] congratulations to 25 episodes you're
[39:33] doing better than most people how many
[39:36] episodes have you done so far uh you
[39:39] have you are my
[39:40] 355 fifth uh
[39:43] episode good for you so you knock these
[39:46] out every single day right I do them
[39:49] every single day uh and I'm starting to
[39:52] do a new show uh an e uh uh per week uh
[39:57] on probably February starting a live
[39:59] show where I go with some news per week
[40:02] with with uh one two other content
[40:04] creators which will be super fun uh but
[40:06] yeah like every day it's it's hard but I
[40:09] love it like yeah that that is so much
[40:12] more fulfilling than what I did before
[40:14] with it Security account management that
[40:16] was not fulfilling to the same degree
[40:19] yeah but so like really cool what are
[40:21] you is is the podcast your main thing or
[40:24] what else are you doing uh I'm starting
[40:27] to I started um it's a slow partnership
[40:31] with a company called Sovereign they
[40:34] reached out to me and they're building a
[40:37] team of Bitcoin Consultants so we're in
[40:40] the beginning uh it's Sovereign uh it's
[40:44] s o v re I GN and I'm going to interview
[40:47] two of their Consultants tomorrow uh
[40:49] they reached out to me and initially
[40:52] when I started to learn about Bitcoin it
[40:54] was really about like me
[40:58] and then eventually my husband our
[41:00] wealth preservation you know and then
[41:03] slowly but surely I'm like you know it
[41:05] would be really cool to see
[41:08] how to I guess educate like individuals
[41:13] and also companies to you know like
[41:17] figure out how to incorporate Bitcoin
[41:19] into their businesses or their business
[41:21] flows and stuff and podcasting has been
[41:24] really helpful with this because I like
[41:25] get to speak to a lot of different
[41:27] people people who do different things
[41:29] and I yeah I just like we shall see we
[41:32] shall see but before that I did um oh
[41:36] where you oh yeah this is it Sovereign
[41:38] oh they're gonna be
[41:40] happy yeah I I have soon uh uh Daniel
[41:45] Frank on my show I think he's on I think
[41:47] this week or next week actually
[41:50] excellent so so and and he I think is
[41:52] the founder if I correct yeah it's
[41:56] interesting because someone I forgot who
[41:58] it was reached out to me like today hey
[42:01] would you not like to have Daniel Frank
[42:03] on on your show and then I was like
[42:05] Danel Frank seems familiar then I saw
[42:07] saw my calendar he he's already
[42:09] scheduled I have that quite some times
[42:11] actually where someone is like hey you
[42:13] should have him on and I already have
[42:14] scheduled him uh would be fun to talk to
[42:17] him and I think there uh it's so Joe
[42:20] McGee is the one who tagged me in one of
[42:24] your posts because you posted something
[42:26] on X saying
[42:27] uh would uh who should I have on my show
[42:30] or something and I think it was Joe
[42:33] McGee who tagged me and said you should
[42:35] have SAA on and I was like oh because oh
[42:39] okay so the other thing too is that I
[42:41] had seen some of your um clips and stuff
[42:46] and a lot of it had to do with price and
[42:48] I thought like I don't talk about price
[42:50] only so who's going to want to hear what
[42:52] I have to say kind of thing you know
[42:54] there was that uh that feel of like oh
[42:57] I'm not going to volunteer to to go on
[42:59] his podcast because I'm not going to
[43:01] make any type of price predictions I'm
[43:03] not a Trader I don't uh I look at
[43:06] generally what Market participants are
[43:08] doing I look at the trend and then I
[43:10] leave like you know the rest up to
[43:13] bitcoin to do what Bitcoin
[43:15] does it's interesting because um I mean
[43:19] we can we can almost do this right now
[43:21] but if you look at my videos uh and you
[43:24] scroll through there there is like every
[43:27] sixth or fifth episode probably like
[43:29] something with price or something that
[43:31] hints at the price uh but if you then uh
[43:36] switch the switch between latest to
[43:39] popular then it's like only price so
[43:42] it's like those who have the price and
[43:44] then those who hint uh at the price and
[43:46] like at a sudden move in Bitcoin and all
[43:49] of the sudden 2025 the million or
[43:51] something like that so like those
[43:52] messages those just get Amplified a lot
[43:56] so what see is because I make content
[43:59] and I ask you and I ask each and every
[44:01] one of my guests is like okay what are
[44:02] you most passionate about in Bitcoin and
[44:05] I talk about that yesterday the episode
[44:07] we talked about John Nash uh and uh how
[44:10] he might be or Sosh Nakamoto or why he
[44:15] has so many different attributes to him
[44:17] also uh uh and this was super super
[44:20] interesting and had nothing to do with
[44:22] the priz but those episodes usually
[44:23] don't get the same reach as the episodes
[44:27] saying oh you don't have enough Bitcoin
[44:29] you should get to 0.1 Bitcoin Bitcoin is
[44:31] going to a million uh retire on your
[44:33] Bitcoin like those things just those
[44:35] things get way more reach so I struggled
[44:39] with that a little bit where I'm like
[44:41] okay um I I come around as just making
[44:44] things on the price even though that's
[44:46] not true but I understand it because
[44:49] most people don't research deeply how
[44:52] much does he really really on price but
[44:54] they see the Amplified Clips especially
[44:56] on Twitter
[44:58] uh uh but it is what it is uh I rather
[45:01] have the Amplified ones uh then they are
[45:04] not Amplified at all so then my reach
[45:06] get gets in general higher so that's
[45:09] kind of the H I don't really care about
[45:12] it but I I observed it that people say
[45:14] like oh why don't you do only about the
[45:16] priz which is not true at all yeah it's
[45:21] it's tough because I I think about that
[45:23] you know um I I I don't know so when did
[45:28] you start to really sort of pay
[45:30] attention to bitcoin was it uh 2020 it
[45:34] was around the same time when saor also
[45:36] came in the game so uh saor Anthony
[45:39] Pomano and CER Mo were the three people
[45:42] that probably uh orange buillt me the
[45:45] most in the first year from like 2020 to
[45:48] okay of 2021 so were you familiar with
[45:51] uh Plan B in the stock to flow model I
[45:54] didn't follow them at all like I'm now
[45:57] familiar with it uh but I was not
[46:00] following him at all and uh he he only
[46:04] got in in my Forefront when I already
[46:06] was very deep into Bitcoin because that
[46:11] was like a really big deal for okay so
[46:14] time is relative in the world of Bitcoin
[46:17] and especially on bitcoin Twitter but it
[46:19] felt like that was like a big deal
[46:21] forever or um a few years ago on what
[46:26] Bitcoin did when Peter McCormack was the
[46:28] host he'd have like Willie woo on who is
[46:32] a Trader that's a thing and actually
[46:35] I've got like um um a pass for Traders
[46:38] because I know a few Traders that's how
[46:41] they are that's who they are they will
[46:42] trade their mothers if they could like
[46:44] it's not about like coins or
[46:46] anything it's just who they are like
[46:48] that's just the way it is but he'd have
[46:51] like Willie woo on who would always talk
[46:52] about price and stuff and he would talk
[46:54] about like altcoins and stuff and after
[46:57] a while I just thought like this is th
[47:00] this
[47:01] is this is not my thing you know I'm not
[47:04] interest I don't want to be a
[47:06] gazillionaire I don't want to have like
[47:08] the most amount of Bitcoin or money on
[47:10] on the earth like it's not my thing and
[47:12] so I pulled away and I noticed that when
[47:15] you don't talk about price and stuff it
[47:17] just uh sorry sorry I had I had to put
[47:21] this in uh I I will not I will not read
[47:23] it out loud I don't know if the algorthm
[47:25] likes that but uh uh anyone who's
[47:28] watching the video can can now see the
[47:30] memes I I I I really do enjoy that Meme
[47:33] and I think I shared it at least like 50
[47:35] times on Twitter
[47:37] already sorry I interrupted you go ahead
[47:40] oh no that's okay I haven't seen this
[47:42] meme actually what SE that meane no wow
[47:47] that that that is such a because I also
[47:50] am like with you I'm like uh buy
[47:52] something that you really enjoy and then
[47:54] you really like like Bitcoin and then
[47:56] provide value for the community and
[47:58] that's the strategy that's that's my
[48:00] trade I I buy provide value and buy more
[48:05] of
[48:06] it yeah exactly it's as it's as
[48:10] complicated or as easy as that that's
[48:12] really good it's like oh what is uh what
[48:15] else did I
[48:16] hear um the analysis is like horoscopes
[48:21] horoscopes for women or something
[48:26] because you get caught up and you're
[48:27] like yeah it's gonna be this price and I
[48:30] mean as an individual nothing makes you
[48:32] look less credible than saying Bitcoin
[48:34] is gonna reach X price by this date and
[48:36] it doesn't it does the complete opposite
[48:38] but it's interesting because there have
[48:40] been a lot of
[48:42] examples like Samson Mau for example I
[48:45] like him a lot I I met him in sa party
[48:49] at 100K in Miami
[48:51] um you met him where at the saor 100K
[48:55] party uh in in in Miami
[48:57] uh he was also there and there's like I
[49:01] I like him but I think he's an good
[49:03] example of like uh even if you have a
[49:08] hyper bullish with day and time stuff on
[49:11] you and it doesn't come to fruition it
[49:15] it seems to
[49:16] not um be bad on your repetition too
[49:19] much because he said within I can
[49:22] remember before the ETFs the ETFs came
[49:25] uh he was like Bitcoin will reach a
[49:28] million dollars within weeks obviously
[49:34] didn't uh but it doesn't seem to be
[49:37] really hindering you his reputation
[49:40] because he's just the hyper bull I think
[49:41] he's the most bullish yeah on on bitcoin
[49:45] ever uh so it's interesting for me when
[49:47] you look at
[49:49] um I I don't doe predictions because
[49:54] it's I I have a lot of guests on that do
[49:57] predictions so people think I have
[49:58] prediction but I actually don't um I
[50:01] think we can reach any price this year
[50:03] but I also think we can reach uh we can
[50:06] just go down this year it's it's
[50:07] possible I don't know the future and I
[50:10] don't trade on it because I just buy
[50:11] Bitcoin but it's an interesting question
[50:14] of like uh reputation in Bitcoin and
[50:18] what is bad for you and what is uh good
[50:20] for you and I think being hyper bullish
[50:23] on bitcoin seems to be even if you're
[50:26] wrong not bad the thing that is really
[50:29] bad for you if you are um promoting not
[50:32] an altcoin if you're promoting that that
[50:34] cancels you within like a day or two
[50:37] yeah which is highly understandable I
[50:40] mean yes it's I mean scarcity like this
[50:44] can only this could only happen once in
[50:46] a
[50:47] lifetime who like yeah I mean yeah I I
[50:52] don't know I know people who work on
[50:54] different projects I appreciate them as
[50:56] individuals they're very smart I listen
[50:58] to what they have to say but I cannot in
[51:01] good faith endorse what they do
[51:05] because yeah I I don't I'm not part of
[51:08] the central planning team I don't know
[51:10] what the mechanisms are behind it I I've
[51:13] seen so many rug PS I've seen people
[51:16] that I've spoken to about Bitcoin go off
[51:19] and reply to some scam coin because they
[51:22] figure it's just like Bitcoin and if SAA
[51:25] says bitcoin's great therefore this must
[51:27] be great too and lose like thousands of
[51:29] Euros because you know I I I just I I
[51:34] something that I don't have respect but
[51:35] I just don't pay attention yeah it's
[51:37] it's it's same for me uh the only thing
[51:39] where I I get angry if someone uses the
[51:42] good name of Bitcoin to promote their
[51:44] own shitcoin that that's something where
[51:46] I'm like no that's that's too much
[51:48] that's that's clearly scam if you just
[51:50] build something and and you're trying to
[51:52] compete in the free market go ahead I
[51:54] will not be part of it yeah but that's
[51:57] fine for me um is there a wish uh you
[52:00] have you had some some Bitcoin guest on
[52:03] you active on Twitter you have some
[52:05] grasp on on the community is there some
[52:07] wish you have for the Bitcoin community
[52:09] that that the Bitcoin Community could
[52:11] improve uh could improve the community
[52:14] itself or the protocol or I think the
[52:17] community aspect of it uh protocol would
[52:19] also be interesting uh uh but but uh the
[52:22] community itself like the the the
[52:24] network of people
[52:27] m not really you know why
[52:30] because this is an example of people
[52:33] just being people and reaching a
[52:36] consensus on certain things when it's
[52:39] necessary um honestly I mean there's so
[52:44] much going on in my life where I I if
[52:46] there's something I don't like or I
[52:48] don't appreciate then I just don't pay
[52:49] attention to it and I think that that is
[52:53] it's really important to
[52:56] to get to that phase because you know
[52:58] someone is just partaking in nonsense
[53:01] and no one pays attention to them
[53:02] they'll stop really quickly because
[53:04] they're not getting that attention
[53:06] reward and so yeah I I don't uh I know
[53:11] people complain about like toxic
[53:13] maximalism and whatever I've been called
[53:16] a few names or I've been like referred
[53:18] to because of the color of my skin and
[53:20] I'm a woman and I'm just like really
[53:22] like is that all you have like you have
[53:25] no imagination or creativity make me
[53:29] laugh at least you know and I think that
[53:32] that is like a superpower that comes
[53:34] along
[53:36] with studying Bitcoin holding Bitcoin
[53:39] huddling Bitcoin being like doing your
[53:41] first transaction or spinning up your
[53:43] node for the first time and being scared
[53:45] and sweaty and overcoming it and staying
[53:48] the course it there's a sense of
[53:51] confidence that I don't want to say
[53:53] everyone acquires but I've personally
[53:55] acquired and so yeah like just do you do
[54:00] you be you and try to be constructive I
[54:02] guess that would be the advice try to be
[54:05] constructive in most things that you do
[54:07] wait wait you have been attacked because
[54:09] of your skin color and that you're woman
[54:13] someone called me the
[54:14] n-word oh man yeah and I was like wow I
[54:18] mean okay if you want to do that fine
[54:22] it's just and and you know I don't even
[54:25] know that this person is a bitcoiner
[54:28] themselves and so maybe it's just like
[54:31] some spook infiltrating trying to like
[54:34] create Ruckus or something I don't know
[54:36] I can't verify the identity of most of
[54:38] the people that I interact with but I
[54:41] just think
[54:42] like I don't know you have to be unhappy
[54:45] or something to do that we are living in
[54:49] an age where this amazing creation
[54:53] called
[54:54] Bitcoin has just been like you know sort
[54:57] of sprinkled on us and we are still
[55:01] amongst the the the the early adopters
[55:04] who figured this thing out who went
[55:07] through all the highs and the lows and
[55:09] were still here and you're going to call
[55:11] someone a name like what's wrong with
[55:13] you I mean and it has nothing to do with
[55:16] you know a technical subject it has
[55:18] nothing to do with uh you know a bit
[55:20] that's in the pipeline it's just like
[55:22] you're you just saw an image of me and
[55:25] you called me a name like that's you're
[55:28] maybe you're not really into Bitcoin
[55:30] like maybe you're just here to troll
[55:31] freely and good for you do that if
[55:33] that's your thing but you know there's a
[55:36] good and a bad coming from the anonymity
[55:38] of the internet uh because people all of
[55:41] the sudden uh call you stuff and they
[55:44] feel protected because they're Anum but
[55:47] I feel like in in in general it's still
[55:49] a good thing that we have the
[55:50] possibility to be private on the
[55:52] internet um but it also brings out a bad
[55:55] side of the human beings I feel like and
[55:58] I'm
[55:59] sometimes I I I I I I stopped
[56:03] interacting with hate comments now I
[56:04] started again because it's it's fun
[56:07] again um I got today a comment it was
[56:10] some critique uh uh about the the video
[56:13] uh thumbnail most I get critiques on on
[56:16] the thumbnails because I try to make the
[56:19] thumbnail and the title so more and more
[56:22] people click it and then it seems
[56:24] clickbaity but I have my own definition
[56:27] but it works but but it works and um for
[56:30] me clickbait is if you portray something
[56:32] in the title in the thumbnail that is
[56:34] not in in the video which I never do uh
[56:37] the the sentences that I use and the
[56:39] words that I use in title and thumbnail
[56:41] I actually said by the by the guest
[56:43] that's all almost my Golden Rule so I
[56:45] never do clickbait but I
[56:47] do I do I make it bigger than it is like
[56:51] yeah yeah that exactly um and one of
[56:56] that got uh really hard uh criticized
[57:00] and it's like a such a long comment so
[57:02] it was really that there was some
[57:03] substance there and he ended the
[57:05] sentence with stop smelling your own
[57:12] farts that's
[57:14] funny and then I was like that that's
[57:17] nice and I was just like oh how do I do
[57:19] that like I cannot stop and then I was
[57:22] like yeah let's leave it like
[57:24] that but but but I do like I do do like
[57:28] trolls and I feel like I don't get them
[57:30] enough I feel like I'm not controversial
[57:32] enough I get uh uh hate comments or
[57:35] troll comments or even really bad
[57:38] comments every third day or something
[57:41] like that and I would like I probably
[57:44] will some point make like a a video of
[57:47] the collection of all the hate comments
[57:49] yeah that's good I think that's a lot of
[57:51] fun I always enjoyed them watching from
[57:53] my favorite creators if they do it but
[57:55] it's fun to to see it it's it's almost
[57:57] like a
[57:58] creativity but there has to be some
[58:01] creativity in there just calling you an
[58:02] nword is is not creative at all like
[58:05] there's nothing to that that's that's
[58:06] just that's lazy yeah it is absolutely
[58:09] lazy and you know I'm North American and
[58:13] I moved to Switzerland in
[58:16] 2008 so it's been a long time and I've
[58:20] assimilated into sort the mindset here
[58:23] it took a while but to just like be
[58:27] myself go out you know no one I mean I
[58:33] do live close to the French border
[58:34] French people are different but in
[58:36] Switzerland itself like I don't feel
[58:39] people Target me or anything in North
[58:42] America it was different uh going to the
[58:45] US I know black and white is just like
[58:47] the lens through which many people see
[58:50] things and stuff and so I just I I I
[58:54] just see big coin as an
[58:57] opportunity uh in a long time frame for
[59:00] people to really start focusing on the
[59:04] value that they bring to their
[59:06] communities and so you know when one
[59:10] type of person or one group of Elites
[59:12] are not no longer in charge of the money
[59:15] printer and there can be a fairer I'm
[59:19] not saying perfect but fairer
[59:21] distribution of money perhaps that will
[59:24] incentivize regular people because
[59:26] there's still what is it 4% of the the
[59:28] population or Psychopaths or something
[59:30] like that there's still like that 4%
[59:32] that'll stir things up I don't want to
[59:34] swear but for the regular people like I
[59:37] think it's an opportunity to really you
[59:39] know Define who you are what you bring
[59:42] to the table so to speak and build
[59:46] collectively around that instead of just
[59:49] like yeah just focusing on what people
[59:53] you know what traits they have and
[59:55] whether you think that this type of
[59:57] trait is like is is worthy of whatever
[60:00] your sense of worthiness is yeah this
[60:04] this political divide between uh one
[60:07] group and another group and they're like
[60:09] handles of those groups that you can
[60:11] divide is uh is really sad to see and
[60:14] and how you get attacked just because
[60:16] you say something that goes towards one
[60:18] group and he thinks he's towards another
[60:20] group uh it's it's it's sad to see uh
[60:23] with with all types of different issues
[60:27] um do you think Bitcoin has the
[60:28] potential as you just described to to
[60:30] build a bridge and to solve kind of this
[60:33] issues because I feel like there's two
[60:35] narrative like there one narrative is
[60:38] Bitcoin fixes the money and fixes
[60:39] therefore almost all issues and Bitcoin
[60:42] is just money uh it's just a tool and
[60:45] will not change anything about the human
[60:47] psychology I think um like time Horizon
[60:51] is a very important variable in this so
[60:54] in the immediate in the immediate term I
[60:56] don't think so um because we're still
[60:59] like even the discussion about is
[61:00] Bitcoin a currency or is it a commodity
[61:03] like these legal definitions we're still
[61:05] using our old school mindset to project
[61:08] onto Bitcoin what we need it to be um
[61:11] and so in the shortterm no in the long
[61:14] long long long term maybe because again
[61:18] it's scarcity like you have to if you
[61:22] can't physically confiscate someone's
[61:24] Bitcoin like you could with gold gold
[61:26] for example you have to figure out
[61:28] another way to get that from them and
[61:32] that other way could be providing value
[61:34] um and within the the our Meetup Group
[61:38] we've had this back and forth for a long
[61:40] time because there are
[61:42] people understandably who come from
[61:45] countries that have been at War for a
[61:46] long time say that there's no way
[61:48] Bitcoin will help um eliminate Wars I
[61:53] don't have that experience so I'm still
[61:55] idealistic in my view I think Bitcoin
[61:58] will help minimize Wars because you need
[62:00] resources in order to run Wars and when
[62:03] your resources are scarce um then you
[62:07] have to rethink how you're going to go
[62:09] about doing things so I think it is
[62:11] possible in the very long term and I'm
[62:13] hopeful for
[62:15] that that's that's great yeah I I hope
[62:18] also that happens and I hope I'm I'm
[62:21] really I'm really hopeful to see the
[62:23] future and I see a lot of great changes
[62:25] to the last couple of weeks and months
[62:28] where I'm like okay I I I do think we uh
[62:31] we live in a great uh time and I hope we
[62:34] we move in a in a good direction at
[62:36] least I I'm always too optimistic about
[62:39] the world so I I hope I'm right have you
[62:42] always been an optimist I always been an
[62:45] absolute Optimist like I always uh seen
[62:48] uh the the best in people the the best
[62:50] in uh in things uh so when I encounter
[62:54] Bitcoin it was hard because I thought
[62:57] it's a scam because I was involved in a
[63:00] Bitcoin related scam like they used
[63:02] Bitcoin in a scam so I had this mindset
[63:05] of uh Bitcoin is a scam but as soon as I
[63:08] got over that uh the the optimism in me
[63:12] then kind of understood Bitcoin and was
[63:14] really fast towards let's go all
[63:16] in uh and it's for me hard to say no and
[63:20] I learned this this year because of the
[63:22] podcast there are a lot of opportunities
[63:24] coming my way and for Optimist it's
[63:26] always hard to say no to stuff and to
[63:29] Opportunities because you always want to
[63:32] do it and you always see the best in
[63:35] everything which is great and bad and uh
[63:38] so yeah I I learned the hard way this
[63:40] year to say no do a lot of things uh
[63:43] that I also want to do just because I I
[63:45] cannot work more than 60 70 hours a week
[63:48] I'm at my limit and now I'm now trying
[63:50] to Outsource things but yeah say saying
[63:53] yes and being optimistic about the
[63:54] future that's always
[63:56] uh with me as long as I can remember at
[63:59] least yeah same which which helped me
[64:02] build that podcast otherwise it would
[64:04] have not been possible you have to be
[64:07] highly bullish on yourself and optimist
[64:09] about optimistic about your future and
[64:11] Bitcoin and everything that you even
[64:13] start that and have the time that's uh
[64:16] every day that's amazing congratulations
[64:19] oh thank you so much yeah it's uh it's
[64:22] it it goes better and better with time
[64:24] the longer you do it the EAS easy it
[64:26] gets um we have one question that I
[64:28] asked each and every one of my guests uh
[64:30] the the question is what can we learn
[64:32] from you besides
[64:34] Bitcoin besides Bitcoin um besides
[64:38] Bitcoin you know
[64:40] what don't you can do whatever you feel
[64:44] like doing so never limit yourself to a
[64:48] particular box or geographical region or
[64:51] profession or anything really if you can
[64:54] see it can figure out how to get it done
[64:58] and I say that because um so my parents
[65:01] are from Trinidad and Tobago they
[65:03] immigrated to Toronto before I was born
[65:06] they had me my sister well my sister
[65:08] first uh and then me and um they didn't
[65:12] have a lot of money like my life is like
[65:15] divided into so many different sort of
[65:17] chapters but from the ages of I would
[65:19] say like uh my birth to about maybe 10
[65:23] or so my parents didn't have a lot of
[65:26] money they were in school at University
[65:29] they had to work part-time to pay off
[65:31] their student loans like the typical
[65:33] story if you will and uh my first few
[65:36] years were in like lower income housing
[65:39] but it was really a means to an end I
[65:42] guess you would say and then they paid
[65:44] off all their loans my parents they're
[65:45] retired now but they were high school
[65:47] teachers they had good salaries at the
[65:49] time and you know we just lived life and
[65:52] stuff and during those like first first
[65:55] I guess 10 years and even throughout
[65:57] high school there were a lot of
[65:58] stereotypes that were projected about um
[66:01] especially within the black or cariban
[66:03] Community like being a single mother
[66:06] just having a certain like way of living
[66:09] or seeing things and I always thought
[66:12] you know we can choose I don't want that
[66:14] you know I want other things I want to
[66:16] travel I want to do so many different
[66:18] things and that's what I ended up doing
[66:20] because I just said you know what this
[66:22] is a this is a stereotype is sort of a
[66:27] um um like a sheema a scheme that's put
[66:31] out there a template that's reinforced
[66:33] through I'm going to sound like you're a
[66:35] conspiracy theorist but it's reinforced
[66:37] in movies and music I like this movie I
[66:40] like the song but that's not who I am I
[66:42] appreciate the artwork the storytelling
[66:45] but I'm not going to follow along with
[66:47] that so essentially follow your own
[66:50] path that's so important and and that's
[66:52] such uh it's it's a message to you hear
[66:56] so much it's it's almost like a message
[66:58] that is it's such a no prer but still I
[67:02] see almost nobody following that twice
[67:06] it's one of that like almost everyone
[67:07] says it and less people and say it
[67:09] actually do it um because people are
[67:12] thinking they have to confirm with their
[67:15] prior experience and in their prior
[67:17] boxes and they they have to stay in that
[67:20] lane it's it's it's a topic I could talk
[67:23] hours about uh but it's it I I like the
[67:26] message and uh that's why I asked that
[67:28] question because I think it's really
[67:30] important to get an identity outside of
[67:34] Bitcoin also for bitcoiners and to get
[67:36] other things than just Bitcoin there uh
[67:40] and that's why I like the question it
[67:43] brings out another side of of of all the
[67:45] Bitcoin that are here and it's
[67:47] interesting because as you also did uh
[67:49] today most of the bitcoiners think one
[67:53] two maybe some three 4 seconds before
[67:55] they answer that question because they
[67:57] are not used to answering questions
[68:00] outside of Bitcoin and and I like to
[68:03] challenge those uh things a little bit
[68:05] yeah really cool thank you so much for
[68:07] the answer and for that um we have an
[68:09] end in the podcast we the previous guest
[68:11] is asking a question for the next guest
[68:13] without knowing who the next guest
[68:15] actually is and your question for from
[68:17] the previous guest uh we already
[68:19] discussed it a little bit is about John
[68:21] Nash uh he was really big on him uh what
[68:24] do you know about John Nash if you know
[68:27] him and could he be satosi
[68:30] Nakamoto so I know very little um about
[68:34] John Nash and so I would love I will go
[68:37] back and look at your previous episode
[68:39] to see and with respect to could he be
[68:43] Satoshi Nakamoto I will say the most
[68:46] cliche thing ever we are all Satoshi
[68:48] Nakamoto and I don't uh I I don't
[68:52] necessarily speculate on who Satoshi
[68:54] could be
[68:56] uh because I mean you
[68:57] know I don't think yeah that's not my
[69:00] cup of tea so yeah it's uh it's it's a
[69:03] good thing to do I also try to not
[69:05] speculate on it but honestly it was the
[69:08] most compelling case I have ever heard
[69:10] from anyone uh about John Nash and I
[69:14] didn't knew John Nash at all like the
[69:16] the name and didn't even knew that he
[69:19] was a Nobel Prize winner and stuff like
[69:21] that like he was just a no name for me
[69:24] um so
[69:25] yeah that that was interesting for me I
[69:27] was like oh
[69:29] like All the Things New in in one
[69:31] episode so you will see me with a lot of
[69:34] question marks in in in that podcast
[69:36] episode oh nice because I didn't do
[69:39] anything really cool thank you so much
[69:41] uh SAA uh is it that right pronunciation
