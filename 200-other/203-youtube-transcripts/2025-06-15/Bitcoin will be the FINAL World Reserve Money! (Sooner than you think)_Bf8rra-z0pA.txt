[00:00] the vast overwhelming majority of the
[00:02] world still doesn't own any Bitcoin we
[00:05] are early in the adoption curve and
[00:07] people still have a massive opportunity
[00:09] they know that the last ability that
[00:11] they have the last chance that these
[00:12] totalitarian authoritarian regimes have
[00:15] to maintain their death grip on the
[00:18] control of the populace is to control
[00:20] the money if it wasn't for Bitcoin we
[00:21] wouldn't have the ability to opt out but
[00:23] because we do we can take our monetary
[00:25] energy our economic energy and pull it
[00:27] out of that system of control we're now
[00:30] seeing this game theory of Bitcoin play
[00:32] out at the nation state level bitcoiners
[00:34] are becoming and will become the most
[00:36] powerful and dominant political and
[00:38] economic force in the world Bitcoin does
[00:40] not need politicians but politicians do
[00:43] need Bitcoin a Bitcoin strategic Reserve
[00:46] will happen in the United States and I
[00:47] think that it will happen in the United
[00:49] States first the game is on this is Game
[00:51] Theory playing out Fiat steals from you
[00:53] they print out of nothing what you need
[00:55] to work your entire life to earn that is
[00:58] immoral Bitcoin is moral money micro
[01:00] strategy has been the best performing
[01:02] company thanks to its Bitcoin strategy
[01:04] since they adopted Bitcoin they've
[01:06] outperformed Nvidia the biggest career
[01:07] risk for you is not adopting Bitcoin
[01:10] this is the last monetary Revolution
[01:12] this is the last zero to one moment
[01:14] Bitcoin provides a check on those Fiat
[01:17] currencies and badly managed Fiat
[01:19] currencies will fail faster Bitcoin will
[01:21] be the world's Reserve money that may
[01:23] happen much sooner than we think
[01:27] [Music]
[01:30] you've done three today yeah I've done
[01:32] three usually I I keep it with two but
[01:35] uh the three was good today damn man
[01:39] you're you are on it that's uh that's
[01:41] impressive that's some good stamina
[01:42] you've got yeah it's it's it's it's
[01:46] interesting because I I like actually
[01:47] having two uh two is kind of the good
[01:50] like like one is I like to prepare like
[01:53] for like two or three uh if it's just
[01:56] one it's like okay I I ramp my energy up
[01:58] for like one uh and then like after an
[02:01] hour two
[02:02] hours all gone like I have too much
[02:04] energy for that like after the first one
[02:07] I really want to do another one uh but
[02:10] yeah I had did one time four and the
[02:13] fourth was just too much oh my god dude
[02:16] that's yeah four is four is a little uh
[02:19] that that'd be a bit too much for me I
[02:20] think um I I think the most I've done in
[02:23] a day is is two but I'm still mining
[02:25] Fiat uh so I I don't always have the the
[02:28] the full time to get in a bunch of them
[02:31] but that's that's impressive man your
[02:32] show's been crushing it oh you're um Oh
[02:36] I thought you working in in Bitcoin what
[02:37] are you what are you doing uh I without
[02:40] uh without doxing too much let's just
[02:42] say I work in uh International
[02:44] distribution um so yeah I'll I'll just
[02:47] leave it General like that um but yeah
[02:50] so yeah I've got a I've got a full-time
[02:52] Fiat job uh family business type thing
[02:55] and it takes up a lot of time so the the
[02:58] podcast is my way of being able to to
[03:00] relax and talk to bitcoiners and uh and
[03:02] you know have something that's outside
[03:04] of that normal Fiat mining job oh man
[03:08] that's great I because I see your
[03:10] podcast and it's such a professional
[03:12] thing uh that I thought you do it
[03:14] professionally because your production
[03:16] quality and everything is so so good
[03:18] done and I was like Hey like he he's
[03:19] doing it full time like it's it's
[03:22] amazing to see that you're doing it
[03:24] basically parttime like as a as a hob
[03:26] and your production is amazing oh thanks
[03:28] man I mean you know I don't uh I don't
[03:30] watch sports so I think that gives me
[03:33] like some extra time it's like you know
[03:35] what else would I be doing in in the
[03:37] late afternoons I'd probably be you know
[03:39] uh wasting the time away at something
[03:41] else so it's like ah why not just have
[03:42] another you know another Bitcoin podcast
[03:44] can't hurt I I think we we can't have
[03:46] too many Bitcoin podcasts until there
[03:48] are more Bitcoin podcasts than there are
[03:50] traditional Finance podcasts and there
[03:52] are a lot of them so we've got a long
[03:55] ways to go still we need more Bitcoin
[03:57] podcasts many more yeah I mean we can
[04:00] directly start with that in because it's
[04:02] it's super interesting for me um when
[04:04] people say oh there are too many piton
[04:06] podcasts I mean
[04:08] honestly I only heard it once actually
[04:10] and this was before I even started uh
[04:13] it's like I didn't heard it too much but
[04:16] I I hear that sometimes and I'm like
[04:18] okay if there's too many Bitcoin
[04:21] podcasts how is it that uh the Bitcoin
[04:25] podcast have viewers and people are
[04:27] watching and listening to them like this
[04:29] would be the free market like if
[04:30] nobody's watching and listening my
[04:31] podcast then it's like oh yeah maybe
[04:33] that's too much or I suck no I mean I I
[04:36] think it's funny I I've heard that
[04:38] critique a lot I mean maybe it's not
[04:40] even a critique it's just people feeling
[04:42] like if you're in the Bitcoin space I
[04:44] think or you've been following the
[04:45] Bitcoin space very closely sure it could
[04:47] feel like there are too many Bitcoin
[04:49] podcasts you know there you you can
[04:50] search for Bitcoin in you know any of
[04:52] your podcasting apps and you see a bunch
[04:55] of them right but really there are like
[04:57] millions and millions of podcasts
[04:59] podcasts I think something like 90%
[05:01] don't make it past the 25th episode uh
[05:04] so most of them die die off but
[05:07] podcasting I think is like we've seen
[05:10] especially I think this last election
[05:11] cycle showed us very clearly the Legacy
[05:14] Media is is dying it it is in its last
[05:17] death throws they barely get any
[05:19] viewership even when they're streaming
[05:21] on other platforms you know YouTube
[05:23] whatever they're still not getting the
[05:25] viewership of podcasts or I was on
[05:27] Election night I was watching between
[05:30] pbd podcast and flipping back and forth
[05:33] and then throwing on some like MSNBC
[05:35] things like that to see people losing
[05:37] their minds and pbd podcast had more
[05:40] concurrent viewers than any of the
[05:42] Legacy Media channels did on YouTube and
[05:45] we've also seen you know the I mean
[05:47] between let's say Joe Rogan uh even guys
[05:50] like you know Theo vaugh uh Dave Smith
[05:53] there's a huge huge appetite for these
[05:56] long form discussions for long form
[05:58] podcasts and when it comes to bitcoin we
[06:02] are still barely scratching the surface
[06:04] yeah there might seem like a lot of
[06:05] Bitcoin podcasts because the number of
[06:07] bitcoiners out there is still relatively
[06:08] small but the majority of the world
[06:11] still has not been turned on to bitcoin
[06:13] and so I think there's still a massive
[06:15] opportunity for people to get out there
[06:17] and I mean heck you know start competing
[06:19] Bitcoin podcast start as many as you can
[06:22] make it so that we completely eclipse
[06:24] the financial uh you know the finance
[06:25] boy podcasts that's when we we know that
[06:28] Bitcoin is truly winning and I think I
[06:30] forget who it was might have been nvk
[06:32] said uh you know at a certain point in
[06:35] every bitcoiners career they start a
[06:37] podcast and I think that might be true
[06:39] and he's got a great one himself you
[06:41] know they start a Bitcoin podcast and
[06:43] they write a Bitcoin book exactly that
[06:46] yeah that's that's a it's a just a
[06:48] further down the line in your Bitcoin
[06:49] Journey those things must happen
[06:51] eventually I mean it's it's only logical
[06:54] because in in your close area uh you're
[06:57] probably one of the only bitcoiners uh
[06:59] if if you have an orange bu everyone and
[07:02] somewhere this energy has to go and then
[07:05] yeah let's let's start a podcast it's
[07:07] kind of how this happened I just started
[07:09] as a side project and and then with
[07:11] sponsorships and all of the sudden the
[07:12] money came in and I was like oh I guess
[07:14] I have a business now I have to go full
[07:16] full time now but it's interesting um
[07:20] especially the CH Rogan Trump interview
[07:23] I think a lot of people woke up to that
[07:26] I saw one comment down there and I
[07:28] always like to scroll through the
[07:29] comments uh when I listen to podcast
[07:32] something like that because it's always
[07:33] interesting what people say uh and there
[07:35] was like the top three third or top
[07:38] fifth uh comment was like this is the
[07:42] the exact time when everyone
[07:44] acknowledged that a podcast is now more
[07:46] powerful than mainstream media and I
[07:50] mean jogan did a great job in in in that
[07:53] and it's it's it's really fascinating to
[07:55] see because also I think El musk
[07:57] actually said it that the lengthy
[08:00] podcasts that um Trump was on with aen
[08:05] Ross with Paul Logan Paul I think it was
[08:09] also with TR Rogan uh they really made a
[08:12] difference because his key demographics
[08:14] are young man and he Donald Trump just
[08:17] went where his key demographic was yeah
[08:21] no and I mean we're at this point now
[08:24] where independent uh you could
[08:26] independent or decentralized media
[08:28] whatever you want to call it you know
[08:29] podcasts YouTube channels whatever even
[08:31] if they're on a centralized platform
[08:33] like YouTube but this is Independent
[08:35] Media right this is people that just
[08:37] decided I'm just going to start talking
[08:38] and talk to people and I love you know
[08:40] you notice that it's actually a lot of
[08:41] comedians are very successful in this
[08:44] kind of format and I think it's because
[08:46] they're just good at talking they're
[08:47] also uh usually if you're if you're a
[08:49] pretty funny person you have to have at
[08:51] least a decent amount of intelligence
[08:53] like you may you may play you know an
[08:55] idiot on stage but you're generally
[08:57] pretty intelligent if you can come up
[08:58] with a ton of organic and original
[09:02] content that makes people laugh like
[09:03] that's hard to do and so you see these
[09:05] you know it may seem ridiculous to
[09:07] somebody who has their head buried in
[09:09] the sand that somebody like Joe Rogan
[09:11] who is you know a Fear Factor host uh
[09:13] you know is into uh you know mixed
[09:15] martial arts and uh and all this stuff
[09:18] that that he just now is the most
[09:20] powerful voice in the media in the world
[09:24] like this is a fact he I don't know how
[09:26] many views he had on the Trump episode
[09:29] but some probably like 60 million at
[09:31] this point maybe more I think still his
[09:32] most watched podcast to date is his
[09:35] original Elon Musk one which is like 90
[09:37] million uh but I'd be willing to bet
[09:39] that this Trump one ends up breaking
[09:41] that record and I think you're
[09:43] absolutely right that like this was a
[09:44] moment where people realized Independent
[09:47] Media is so much more powerful if they
[09:49] didn't already know now they know for
[09:51] sure because people don't want those
[09:53] they don't want the news sound bite of
[09:55] 60 seconds sitting in a news desk that's
[09:57] kind of scripted and or you know the 60
[09:59] Minutes interviews uh that Cala did
[10:02] where they were you know cutting stuff
[10:03] together to make her sound better like
[10:05] there's no authenticity in that and
[10:07] people can smell the and they
[10:09] want to actually hear what a person has
[10:11] to say in detail they want to get to
[10:13] know that person they want to know is
[10:15] this person like just an actor playing a
[10:18] game or are they a real person who has
[10:20] real thoughts and they can actually talk
[10:22] about them at length for I mean Rogan
[10:24] rolls for like three hours which is
[10:26] which is nuts so I think it's a the
[10:29] landscape is forever changed and I don't
[10:31] see it going back like the trend towards
[10:34] decentralization is too strong it can't
[10:37] centralize back at least not for a long
[10:39] time that pendulum always swings back
[10:41] and forth but I think it's on this side
[10:43] of decentralized Independent Media for
[10:45] now I I have an interesting stats to
[10:47] Jong because I was researching that once
[10:50] I like get got in the podcast gam game a
[10:53] little bit he did over the past 15 years
[10:57] 3.4 podcasts per week
[11:00] and this
[11:01] is like if he would just go for an hour
[11:05] that would be impressive like super
[11:06] impressive but he had conversation with
[11:09] like three four five hours uh the hours
[11:12] he did in conversations with people that
[11:15] alone is so impressive that alone is so
[11:18] much information in his head because all
[11:21] the podcast is then now in his head so
[11:25] like that that is that is just uh pure
[11:29] proof of work that is super over 15
[11:33] years and uh he doesn't have to do that
[11:36] like he he clearly can just like say N I
[11:38] don't like to do it I just relax but uh
[11:41] he he clearly has a bigger go and and
[11:44] it's it's a true inspiration I feel like
[11:47] no and you know I just love it too
[11:48] because he's just a he's just like a
[11:50] regular guy at the end of the day like
[11:52] he'll fully acknowledge that he's not
[11:54] the smartest guy in the room but
[11:55] generally if you're the smartest guy in
[11:56] the room you should probably find a
[11:58] different room and I think Rogan has
[12:00] done a very good job of he finds
[12:02] interesting intelligent people that he
[12:03] wants to talk to or just random strange
[12:06] esoteric people he brings them in talks
[12:08] to them for three hours and you can you
[12:10] can get to know somebody when you have a
[12:11] conversation with them for that amount
[12:13] of time and you see he has some of his
[12:15] favorites he brings back on you know
[12:16] again and again he lifts up a lot of
[12:18] comedians um but I think that he
[12:20] genuinely uses that platform that he has
[12:23] for good like I think Joe Rogan is a
[12:25] massive net benefit to society I'm glad
[12:28] he exists I'm glad that they can't he's
[12:30] too big to deplatform now you know uh I
[12:33] mean I guess nobody's totally too big to
[12:36] deplatform but I think he's he's at
[12:38] least safe for a
[12:39] while I mean yeah it's interesting the
[12:44] for for chog platform you really have to
[12:47] to get out the big
[12:49] guns yeah I mean there's there's always
[12:52] a risk when you are when your primary
[12:55] medium for broadcasting is itself a
[12:57] centralized platform like that's always
[13:00] going to be risk there's there's always
[13:01] risk with YouTube there's always risk
[13:03] with Spotify granted Spotify is paying
[13:05] him a ton of money so it's not in their
[13:07] interest to deplatform him but still as
[13:10] long as somebody you know holds the keys
[13:12] to the kingdom and has that ability it
[13:14] can potentially be used and that's also
[13:16] why I'm very glad that these sort of
[13:18] nent open protocols like noer exist
[13:22] because I think these do provide a
[13:23] viable alternative to the centralized
[13:26] media because it's great that we have
[13:27] Independent Media but that Independent
[13:30] Media is always subject to capture if
[13:33] it's reliant on centralized platforms
[13:35] and I think that's that's important to
[13:37] keep in mind as we go
[13:38] forward yeah we we kind of went from uh
[13:42] like just big media houses now to
[13:44] Independent Media and then now in the
[13:47] future completely Independent Media
[13:49] where uh there are individual people
[13:52] just reporting what they think and then
[13:54] you can make your own things and it's
[13:56] also on an non uh sensor a censorship
[14:01] resistant platform how do you see that
[14:03] when we now uh have this
[14:06] decentralization movement in in media
[14:09] and in platforms but also in money how
[14:11] do how how is that looking in like 10 20
[14:14] years how do you imagine
[14:15] that well I won't pretend to have a
[14:18] crystal ball to be able to anticipate 10
[14:20] to 20 years but the the trend that I see
[14:22] right now is that we as we have just
[14:26] been discussing we already have a trend
[14:29] towards Independent Media independent
[14:31] creators independent voices gaining
[14:33] power gaining influence because people
[14:35] want to hear from somebody that they
[14:38] that they trust right that they have
[14:39] built trust with that they feel like
[14:40] they have some sort of a relationship
[14:42] with as a voice and as a listener right
[14:46] but again we have these centralized
[14:49] platforms YouTube is a great example
[14:51] okay YouTube is a wonderful platform for
[14:54] uh getting your message out there for
[14:57] discovery that said you you are
[14:59] completely at the mercy of their
[15:00] algorithm of their content moderation
[15:03] guidelines of the people that run that
[15:06] company you're at the mercy of Google
[15:08] you know who their motto you know don't
[15:10] be evil but it's like well we all know
[15:11] Google's done plenty of evil if
[15:13] something can be censored then it's
[15:16] vulnerable right it's it doesn't mean
[15:18] it's going to be but it means it can be
[15:20] and that means it's vulnerable and so
[15:22] what I see in the next 10 to 20 years is
[15:25] I see a trend towards people some people
[15:27] there's going to be a small cohort that
[15:29] moves to decentralized uh publishing
[15:31] mediums like noer because they crave the
[15:34] censorship resistance uh they claim or
[15:37] they crave the decentralized ethos and
[15:40] open source ethos of these protocols but
[15:44] I honestly think that the majority of
[15:46] people will move to open protocols like
[15:48] Noster not because of censorship
[15:50] resistance not because it's
[15:53] decentralized simply because it will
[15:55] provide a better user experience for
[15:57] them because it is not a Garden it is
[16:00] not a silo YouTube is a silo right x x
[16:03] is great but X is a silo it's a closed
[16:06] system and closed systems are always
[16:09] going to be inferior to open systems by
[16:12] their very nature any Noster application
[16:15] that is out there whether I'm using
[16:16] damus or Primal or highlighter or zap.
[16:19] stream they're all interoperable I
[16:22] publish once and it's everywhere no
[16:24] matter where my users are you know this
[16:26] very well as a podcaster you have have
[16:29] to publish on X on YouTube on Rumble
[16:31] maybe um you know to your RSS feed RSS
[16:34] is a little bit different because at
[16:35] least that's still an open standard
[16:37] that's a much better
[16:38] standard but regardless you have to
[16:41] publish in a bunch of different places
[16:42] to try and find the users or the viewers
[16:45] where they are with something like noer
[16:48] you have to publish once and wherever
[16:50] your followers are doesn't matter what
[16:52] they're using they'll find it and so I
[16:54] think that is ultimately a better
[16:56] experience for both uh listeners for
[16:59] users but also for Content creators for
[17:01] Publishers the censorship resistance is
[17:04] a huge part of it and I think it's great
[17:06] that that exists but that's not why
[17:07] people are going to ultimately migrate
[17:09] there they're going to migrate there
[17:10] because it is simply a better user
[17:12] experience you have more optionality you
[17:15] are not at the behest of algorithms that
[17:18] are opaque to you and completely define
[17:21] what kind of experience you have the
[17:23] YouTube algorithm I don't think anybody
[17:25] understands except the people who are
[17:26] writing it exactly why it's feeding you
[17:28] with it's feeding you but you know you
[17:30] can go down some strange YouTube rabbit
[17:32] holes or it's feeding you stuff that you
[17:33] know maybe you like but maybe you kind
[17:36] of hate but you just can't look away
[17:38] it's like a car crash on noer you have
[17:40] this opportunity for a complete
[17:42] Marketplace of algorithms a feed
[17:44] Marketplace this this already exists on
[17:46] noter um and it's great to see that
[17:49] because that means you can choose your
[17:50] own adventure you can choose what
[17:52] experience you want or if you don't want
[17:54] any algorithms at all maybe you just
[17:55] want to view a chronological feed that's
[17:58] great too but I think that people
[18:00] ultimately crave optionality they want a
[18:03] little bit more control over their
[18:06] experience and at the end of the day
[18:08] they want somewhere that they can uh
[18:10] they can have fun right that they can
[18:11] connect and that they can feel that
[18:13] they're doing that in a very organic and
[18:15] real way versus being shown whatever the
[18:19] centralized algorithm decides to show
[18:21] them and I think that that's ultimately
[18:23] the power so the again the trend that I
[18:24] see in the next 10 to 20
[18:27] years I see a move M towards more
[18:30] optionality uh and that's the same with
[18:32] decentralized media and Publishing like
[18:34] on noer that's also the same with
[18:37] decentralized open- Source money like
[18:39] Bitcoin people want options they don't
[18:42] want to be forced by Fiat to use this
[18:45] platform to use this money they want to
[18:48] have the option to choose for themselves
[18:50] at least most people do I
[18:52] think that's
[18:55] uh uh I have two examples with money and
[18:58] with
[18:59] um with Nostra because on Nostra I I
[19:04] tried it one year ago and I was not a
[19:06] big fan and then I tried it like a month
[19:08] ago and I was like Hey that that got
[19:10] really good in one year like that the
[19:12] improvements in one year is extremely
[19:15] impressive and if this continues like
[19:17] that that's magical and my magic moment
[19:21] with Nostra was when I started two weeks
[19:25] before that a primal account started to
[19:28] post a little bit got some traction was
[19:30] nice was cool like a new platform uh but
[19:33] then uh two weeks after that I uh got
[19:37] the notification on Fountain hey you can
[19:39] connect your Noster here I was like okay
[19:41] let's let's connect the Noster here I
[19:42] don't know what happens but let's
[19:43] connect it and then uh I started
[19:46] replying uh to to the activity on
[19:49] Fountain then afterwards I opened my
[19:52] Primal and I was like wait my replies
[19:55] are here and people are on Primal now
[19:58] replying to that and I can reply back
[20:00] here on Primal it's like you get a
[20:04] YouTube comment you reply to that
[20:05] YouTube comment and then later you see
[20:08] it on X and you can continue the
[20:11] conversation there that that was my
[20:13] magical moment for that and I was like
[20:15] that's so much better that's not about
[20:17] censorship resistance that that's about
[20:20] a way better open protocol that benefits
[20:23] everyone that that's an that was a
[20:25] magical moment for me where I'm like oh
[20:28] that that has a future I don't know if
[20:30] everyone will use it uh but uh if if
[20:33] it's done right probably everyone will
[20:35] use it and even the big platforms might
[20:38] come over if the network effect gets
[20:41] strong enough because the open uh
[20:43] protocols suck everything in the same
[20:45] with with
[20:47] Bitcoin I I completely agree it
[20:49] literally feels like magic I the
[20:52] fountain integration is a fantastic
[20:54] example of that and I think what those
[20:55] guys are doing over there is amazing for
[20:57] anybody who's listening who has
[20:59] not checked out Fountain I highly
[21:01] recommend you do so uh it's I was a big
[21:04] apple podcast guy just because it's you
[21:06] know it's what comes on your phone right
[21:07] it's already there it's easy and I used
[21:10] it for years but then a couple years ago
[21:11] I started using Fountain and it's first
[21:14] of all the ability to earn SATs you're
[21:16] you can earn money for listening to
[21:18] shows you can give value when you find
[21:19] something valuable and you want to
[21:21] reward the podcasters that are you know
[21:24] giving you value with your own monetary
[21:26] value but this noer integration is a
[21:28] great example of that improved user
[21:31] experience because everything is
[21:34] connected now you're like you said it
[21:36] doesn't matter if that that you're
[21:37] commenting on in fountain or in the prim
[21:39] laap or on Damas or on snort or on Iris
[21:42] or any other noer client it's it's all
[21:45] connected it's just a different way of
[21:47] it's just how you choose to view it
[21:48] right but I think that that improves so
[21:51] much for podcast specifically it
[21:53] improves the ability to have those
[21:55] YouTube like uh experiences where you
[21:58] know the comments on YouTube like PE
[22:01] people love that right they love to be
[22:02] able to leave comments but if you can
[22:04] only leave a comment on Spotify or only
[22:06] on a review on Apple or whatever that's
[22:09] a very isolated conversation when you
[22:11] can leave a comment on Fountain and then
[22:13] that comment goes out to everybody on
[22:16] Noster that's incredibly powerful and it
[22:19] aids in discoverability as well for
[22:21] small shows and that's I think a huge
[22:24] thing that is really makes me very
[22:26] bullish on noer is any anyone can be a
[22:29] Creator right anybody with a with a cell
[22:31] phone with a smartphone which is most
[22:33] people in the world today can be a
[22:35] Creator it's incredible the power that
[22:37] we have here we call them phones but I
[22:39] mean they're they're supercomputers in
[22:41] our pockets right the the phone the
[22:43] phone to actually talk on a phone call
[22:45] is like the thing you do least on your
[22:46] quote phone but anyone can be a Creator
[22:49] but it's very hard to get uh a large
[22:52] reach as a Creator on these centralized
[22:55] platforms that always you know YouTube
[22:57] loves throwing up a Mr Beast video right
[22:59] or uh you know Jake Paul video or
[23:01] whatever it is they they are always
[23:03] geared towards the largest creators that
[23:05] are already saturating that Marketplace
[23:08] but when the marketplace is free and
[23:09] open when it's actually free market
[23:11] competition then anybody has a shot at
[23:13] getting notice getting discovered and
[23:15] directly monetizing the work that
[23:17] they're doing by getting Bitcoin that's
[23:19] a really beautiful thing and I think
[23:21] that has massive potential as we move
[23:23] forward another thing that I thought
[23:25] about is when when you have Nostra you
[23:28] you you have to deal with private Keys
[23:30] uh and all of the sudden um you you get
[23:33] introduced to that idea because when I
[23:37] uh tell people okay okay I'm convinced
[23:40] of why Bitcoin show me now how how I'm
[23:43] going to do it and then I'm and I'm
[23:45] always sweating a little because like
[23:47] then I have to introduce to them the the
[23:49] key of like you have your own keys and
[23:51] and this is for a lot of people the
[23:54] first time ever they hear about private
[23:56] key and encryption and when when people
[23:58] hear things they they don't understand
[24:00] they usually click out they they they
[24:02] away it's like oh that's too much um but
[24:06] I hope we have that uh future where
[24:09] private keys are just like very normal
[24:11] and it's not just for Bitcoin it's just
[24:13] like for for your data it's for your
[24:15] interest everywhere and you can just use
[24:17] it and that that would be I hope that's
[24:20] the that's the future and I hope that
[24:22] maybe noo can also play a key role in uh
[24:24] implementing that because there will be
[24:27] people onboarded on no that might not
[24:29] have an idea about Bitcoin I don't know
[24:31] if that's now the case I think now most
[24:34] have an idea about Bitcoin well I don't
[24:37] I don't mean to interrupt but I know uh
[24:39] multiple specific stories of people that
[24:40] I have uh met like in in real life now
[24:44] at this point I gotten to be friends
[24:45] with through noer that were not at all
[24:48] into Bitcoin beforehand they heard about
[24:50] noer because maybe Jack dorsy or Edward
[24:52] Snowden posted about it you know those
[24:54] two events brought in a ton of people
[24:57] because they're very well Ed they have
[24:59] huge audiences on X on other platforms
[25:02] and so it's not just bitcoiners that
[25:05] follow those guys on X for example so I
[25:08] know multiple people that came in had no
[25:09] idea of
[25:10] Bitcoin and then you know were purple
[25:12] pilled on noer but the purple pill led
[25:15] to the orange pill it was the reason for
[25:17] them saying wait a minute uh you know I
[25:19] I just got on here I'm posting and
[25:21] people are asking me uh why they can't
[25:23] zap me what the heck is a zap oh a zap
[25:25] is where they can send me Bitcoin okay
[25:27] well I thought Bitcoin you know I
[25:29] thought Bitcoin died a while ago was it
[25:31] that's what the media said and then they
[25:32] start look oh okay I need a lightning
[25:34] wallet what's lightning lightning is
[25:35] like this other layer of Bitcoin but
[25:37] it's really fast and cheap oh that's
[25:39] kind of cool okay let me figure that out
[25:40] a little bit so I think it's this
[25:42] natural process of discovery that people
[25:44] go through and it's it's h I would say
[25:46] right now it's the exception versus the
[25:49] rule on noer like most people that are
[25:52] on noer right now like the majority are
[25:55] probably bitcoiners um at least in the
[25:58] US and Europe there are some big
[26:00] audiences in various uh you know Asian
[26:02] countries that uh I'm not sure if
[26:04] they're all bitcoiners but I think that
[26:07] that starts to change as more people
[26:09] adopt this open protocol and I I think
[26:11] you know you made a point earlier about
[26:13] larger centralized platforms maybe uh
[26:17] integrating noer in the future I think
[26:19] that's absolutely going to be the case I
[26:21] would not be surprised if in 10 15 20
[26:23] years every type of quote social media
[26:27] platform
[26:29] had integrate it becomes a noer client
[26:31] basically it integrates noer feeds
[26:33] because it's open easily consumable it's
[26:36] not a Walled Garden why wouldn't you
[26:39] enable a better user experience for your
[26:41] user base uh but you know they have to
[26:44] get over the fact that they'll see it as
[26:46] a threat because right now the goal is
[26:47] keep everybody within the Walled Garden
[26:50] keep everybody within our Silo uh but
[26:52] you know noer is uh noer is an open
[26:55] field and so the other nice thing about
[26:57] it is that because it's a free market of
[26:59] competition because almost every client
[27:02] is open source to your point about oh
[27:05] from one year ago to one month ago the
[27:08] change was incredible right you you can
[27:10] see this and it's it's really amazing
[27:12] and that's because everybody is
[27:15] developing you know everybody's building
[27:16] in production everybody is developing in
[27:19] real time and everybody's learning from
[27:21] each other and their mistakes and their
[27:22] failures to make better experiences but
[27:24] because you don't have control of the
[27:26] users you are forced to compete purely
[27:29] on who delivers the best experience who
[27:33] is giving you the most value in that
[27:35] client and I think that's just an
[27:36] example of open protocols enabling truly
[27:39] free market competition and that's
[27:41] something that just makes me incredibly
[27:43] hopeful about the Humanity's future
[27:45] let's
[27:46] say and I think Nostra is probably the
[27:50] first um magical moment where Bitcoin is
[27:55] just used and people don't even realize
[27:58] it at first like they just like sapping
[28:00] they have a lightning wallet um maybe
[28:02] they just like follow an instruction
[28:04] lightning wallet and and they don't even
[28:06] question like I have SATs I have a
[28:07] lating wallet the Bitcoin word is not
[28:09] even there yet uh and I think we will
[28:12] come to that future where uh a lot of
[28:15] people will use Bitcoin every day and
[28:16] don't even realize it like the same way
[28:19] they use the tcpip protocol uh go out on
[28:22] the street and ask people what the tcpip
[28:24] protocol is most don't have an answer I
[28:26] don't have a good answer to that so like
[28:28] like that that that's the magic they
[28:30] they they know okay I sent this WhatsApp
[28:33] message and there are those ticks coming
[28:35] and then that's how I know the other
[28:37] person got it and the same thing will
[28:39] will happen to bitcoin and Nostra is
[28:41] kind of the the first um um outside of
[28:45] money use case I mean it's it's money
[28:47] sent to each other uh but it's it's not
[28:51] because you want to send money it's
[28:53] because you uh want to inact on a social
[28:55] media platform that that that's kind of
[28:58] kind of incredible to to think about I
[29:00] never really thought that like NOS might
[29:02] be the the first actual use case because
[29:03] we always think of like oh when will
[29:06] WhatsApp integrate Bitcoin I know like
[29:09] we already have WhatsApp on nostro
[29:12] right ly alen has a really good analogy
[29:15] for this which is that noer adds venmo
[29:19] like capabilities to bitcoin because
[29:21] obviously a huge hurdle when it comes to
[29:23] bitcoin and I don't know if you guys
[29:25] maybe don't have venmo in Europe but but
[29:28] I heard a lot about it but I never used
[29:30] it so yeah basic it's actually kind of
[29:32] I'll just give a for anybody who's not
[29:33] familiar with it it's actually kind of
[29:35] creepy it came out uh years ago now uh
[29:38] PayPal has since acquired them uh so you
[29:41] should probably delete it because PayPal
[29:43] supports authoritarian censorship
[29:45] regimes but that's a that's a different
[29:46] digression uh but essentially it added a
[29:49] social layer to payments so you could
[29:51] add your friends on venmo and so you
[29:53] know for splitting a a a check at dinner
[29:55] you can go and there's you know Alice
[29:57] and Bob and uh and Carol and I can split
[30:00] the check with all of them because I can
[30:02] just search their name and I have them
[30:03] in my contact list I it was also very
[30:07] creepy because it publicly broadcasts
[30:08] you can turn this off but by default it
[30:10] publicly broadcasts all the payments
[30:12] that you're making so that's just like
[30:14] super creepy uh but apparently they
[30:17] thought it would be a fun social thing
[30:18] to show you know who you were at dinner
[30:20] with and what you were paying them for
[30:22] but Bitcoin was missing something like
[30:24] that it was missing the social
[30:26] discoverability layer that would allow
[30:28] you to say Okay I want to I want to pay
[30:29] Robin for something uh how do I how do I
[30:33] find Robin's address I mean okay I've
[30:35] got to contact him on another platform
[30:37] I've got to send him a a telegram
[30:38] message a WhatsApp message a signal
[30:40] message whatever it might be I've got to
[30:42] request an address from him or a QR code
[30:44] and then I've got to pay that that's a
[30:45] clunky experience um and also then how
[30:48] do I know for sure that that's him is
[30:50] that you know he's not cryptographically
[30:53] signing the message to confirm that yes
[30:55] in fact this is the address that I'm
[30:56] sending you uh is there the possibility
[30:59] of a man- in- the-middle attack or
[31:00] something like that where your data
[31:01] could be changed partway through and
[31:03] another address inserted but with noer I
[31:06] know that when I go to your npub I know
[31:09] that npub is is yours I know that
[31:11] because it has you know your uh your
[31:13] nipo 5 verification on it I know that
[31:15] because I'm already following you and I
[31:17] have the ability then to without asking
[31:19] you for anything I can go and pay you
[31:22] for whatever you need it just cuts out
[31:24] so much of the clunkiness of that social
[31:28] layer of Bitcoin payment experience and
[31:31] really
[31:32] it's having an open protocol for money
[31:35] sensorship resistant money is great
[31:38] that's what Bitcoin provides sound
[31:40] censorship resistant money but if you
[31:43] don't have an open censorship resistant
[31:46] communication protocol that you can
[31:48] coordinate on then a lot of the benefits
[31:51] of Bitcoin are somewhat lost so you you
[31:54] need the ability to have free speech
[31:56] alongside free and open money otherwise
[31:59] you only have half the solution and so
[32:02] I'm you know not saying noer is perfect
[32:03] I'm sure you know a lot of people like
[32:05] to point out all its flaws and sure it
[32:07] has plenty but it's at least a really
[32:09] great start and so very bullish on the
[32:12] combination of Bitcoin for sensorship
[32:14] resistant sound money and noer for
[32:17] censorship resistant communication and
[32:19] cryptographically verified censorship
[32:21] communication that's really powerful I
[32:24] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[32:28] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[32:31] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[32:34] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[32:36] vigilante made in perfect Bitcoin watch
[32:40] that's the perfect subtle elegant way to
[32:43] go out there and show that you are a
[32:45] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[32:48] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[32:51] dropped a completely new and amazing
[32:53] Genesis edition of their watch
[32:56] collections you have the date of the
[32:58] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[33:02] and of course also the block height and
[33:04] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[33:08] level of detail they put in in this
[33:10] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[33:13] those amazing coin viland the time
[33:15] pieces down in the descriptions I love
[33:18] those watches so so much if you watch or
[33:22] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[33:24] I'll guess you already bought some
[33:26] Bitcoin and now most important step is
[33:29] to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure in
[33:32] a hardware wallet my personal
[33:34] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[33:36] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[33:39] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[33:41] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[33:44] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[33:47] with the code Robin at the checkout
[33:49] visit bitbox
[33:51] do/ robobin to get your bitbox and the
[33:55] next step is to really level up your
[33:57] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[34:00] have the most secure self- custody setup
[34:03] you have to secure your own devices you
[34:06] have to protect your privacy you have to
[34:08] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[34:11] on where you live you even want to have
[34:14] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[34:16] move in case something goes really
[34:18] really wrong and through all those steps
[34:20] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[34:23] step by step and if you visit the
[34:26] Bitcoin way.com
[34:28] Partners SL robobin you even get a 30
[34:30] minute free call to find out how you can
[34:33] level up your
[34:35] sovereignty H it's it's with with payer
[34:39] it's really funny because they are
[34:41] really going hard or on the censorship
[34:45] um a friend of mine knew that and he
[34:48] sent 12 cent to another friend of uh his
[34:51] with the right keywords in in in the in
[34:54] the refer in the payment reference and
[34:57] both accounts got banned they they
[34:59] needed two months to unban it PayPal is
[35:02] worse than Facebook on YouTube it's it's
[35:05] like if you write uh keywords in in in a
[35:09] YouTube comment or something like that
[35:10] you don't get immediately banned might
[35:12] be that uh algorithm gets you but PayPal
[35:16] is really like that that that's crazy it
[35:21] it is insane and I heard a great story I
[35:23] was uh I was interviewing Andy Yen he's
[35:26] the CEO and and founder of proton uh so
[35:29] proton privacy proton uh mail proton VPN
[35:33] and now proton wallet they're developing
[35:35] a Bitcoin wallet and I was asking him
[35:37] you know how did this how did you guys
[35:39] decide to just you know spin up a
[35:40] Bitcoin wallet like it seemed a little
[35:42] bit random to me and then he said back
[35:44] in 2015 either 2015 or 2016 proton was
[35:49] uh basically banned by PayPal they had
[35:52] they were do doing a GoFundMe that was
[35:54] integrated with PayPal they were trying
[35:56] to get all of the funds from GoFundMe
[35:59] and PayPal cut them off they had no
[36:01] access to this and somebody one of the
[36:03] uh in the proton Community said have you
[36:05] guys heard of this Bitcoin thing it
[36:07] seems like it might be very useful for
[36:09] you right now they tried it out they got
[36:12] tons of donations in Bitcoin they've
[36:14] still been holding that Bitcoin to today
[36:17] uh good for them that's amazing but the
[36:20] point was that you know Bitcoin reaches
[36:23] people where the Fiat system the Fiat
[36:25] rails cannot the Fiat rails can be cut
[36:27] off in any time you can't cut off
[36:29] Bitcoin and we see examples of this over
[36:31] and over again you see it with Wikileaks
[36:33] you know uh back in the day you see it
[36:36] even with people raising funds uh for uh
[36:39] relief efforts in Gaza that's a very
[36:42] very important power to have as the
[36:45] individual because if the state if the
[36:48] you know corporations that are
[36:50] coordinating with the state if they can
[36:52] cut you off from money they can cut you
[36:54] off from everything your fre you know
[36:56] freedom of speech is very hard to
[36:59] exercise if you are cut off from the
[37:01] financial rails Freedom uh to to
[37:04] publicly protest is very difficult if
[37:06] you can't buy a bus ticket a plane
[37:08] ticket if you can't get where you're
[37:09] supposed to go if You' have been
[37:10] blacklisted if your bank account's
[37:12] Frozen and we see this as a financial
[37:14] this sort of financial censorship being
[37:16] used we saw it in Canada with the
[37:17] trucker protests uh during covid you see
[37:21] this again and again and again the first
[37:23] tool that authoritarian regimes use now
[37:26] is to cut off your ability to transact
[37:29] it used to be that the first step
[37:31] authoritarian regimes would take is to
[37:33] limit your ability to speak freely
[37:35] because money was a bearer instrument at
[37:37] that time it may have been Fiat but it
[37:39] wasn't digital now that money is digital
[37:42] it can be cut off at a moment's notice
[37:44] and if they can cut you off from the
[37:46] financial system you know in America
[37:48] your second amendment rights get harder
[37:49] to exercise because it's very difficult
[37:51] to buy a gun without money uh it's very
[37:54] difficult to do anything without money
[37:55] you can't and so they know that they
[37:57] have that as a tool that's why cbdcs are
[38:00] being pushed in almost every country in
[38:02] the world right now because they know
[38:05] that the last ability that they have the
[38:07] last chance that these totalitarian
[38:10] authoritarian regimes have to basically
[38:13] maintain their death grip on the control
[38:16] of the populace is to control the money
[38:19] because if they can control the money
[38:20] they can control you and that is why
[38:23] Bitcoin right now is more important than
[38:25] ever in an age where CB DC's are no
[38:29] longer just uh they're not talking about
[38:30] them in the shadows anymore they're out
[38:32] in public about their cbdc pilots all
[38:34] over the world the bank of international
[38:36] set settlements working on their uh you
[38:38] know Global cbdc
[38:40] basically these things are happening and
[38:42] it is up to individuals to reject this
[38:46] with a you know full-throated response
[38:48] to say no we will not be have our money
[38:51] controlled and if you try to implement
[38:53] this well you know what we're still
[38:55] going to say no because we have the
[38:56] ability to opt out if it wasn't for
[38:59] Bitcoin we wouldn't have the ability to
[39:01] opt out but because we do we can take
[39:03] our monetary energy our economic energy
[39:06] and pull it out of that system of
[39:08] control and into an open system that
[39:10] supports freedom of the individual and
[39:13] that is so much more important now than
[39:15] it has ever been before in this digital
[39:18] age it feels like Bitcoin came just at
[39:21] the right time it shouldn't came a later
[39:25] well I mean I think you it's always
[39:27] amazing to me the when you look at the
[39:29] foresight of Satoshi Nakamoto and you
[39:33] see that they basically Bitcoin was
[39:36] launched uh we know that it's very much
[39:38] a response it been in the works for
[39:39] years it was of course building on many
[39:42] other uh many other implementations of
[39:44] trying to get to a a digital cache right
[39:47] a peer-to-peer digital cach but it was
[39:50] launched in the midst of the great
[39:52] financial crisis you know Chancellor on
[39:54] the brink of second bailouts for banks
[39:56] that's that's in the Genesis block so we
[39:59] know that Satoshi saw a lot of this
[40:01] stuff coming uh you know the cipher
[40:03] punks for years had been trying to work
[40:06] on electronic cash but it was uh very
[40:11] difficult to fix that that pesky double
[40:13] spend problem right uh and so the fact
[40:16] that we have that Bitcoin came about at
[40:18] that time and was able to stay under the
[40:21] radar for long enough until it got to
[40:24] the point where it was it was too big
[40:27] for them to shut down it was too Global
[40:28] for the powers that be to shut down it's
[40:31] honestly incredible and I think we
[40:32] should consider I I'm very grateful to
[40:35] all of the cipher punks to Satoshi of
[40:37] course but also to the early adopters of
[40:39] Bitcoin I I was not an early adopter uh
[40:42] I first time I heard about Bitcoin was
[40:44] in
[40:46] 2014 uh and I ignored it uh I heard
[40:48] about it in the Silk Road days from a
[40:50] friend who was using the Silk Road uh
[40:53] and by the way I truly hope that Trump
[40:55] freeze Ross on day one because that man
[40:57] deserves to be free but I heard about it
[40:59] in the Silk Road days I ignored it I
[41:01] said that's whatever you're you're nerdy
[41:03] magic internet money I really don't care
[41:05] man back to whatever Fiat I'm doing
[41:07] heard about it again in 2017 ignored it
[41:10] uh and bought a Litecoin or two because
[41:12] I thought I couldn't afford a whole
[41:14] Bitcoin wasn't until 2020 that I finally
[41:17] came around and was like I need to look
[41:20] into this Bitcoin thing again because
[41:21] they're printing money like crazy
[41:23] they're sending out checks to people
[41:25] where does the money come from what is
[41:26] money it all
[41:28] but I am very grateful to those early
[41:30] people who did not ignore it right away
[41:33] who decided to put uh a lot of time and
[41:35] effort into understanding it in the
[41:37] early days because we wouldn't be having
[41:40] this conversation here today uh we
[41:42] wouldn't be having all these Bitcoin
[41:43] podcasts that we do today if it wasn't
[41:45] for those early folks who built on
[41:48] bitcoin who developed on bitcoin and
[41:49] around it and who put their time and
[41:51] energy and their economic power into
[41:53] making this a reality and it's uh it is
[41:56] kind of magical that this this is a
[41:57] place where we're at now where you see
[41:59] nation state adoption happening where
[42:02] you see you know like them or not
[42:04] Bitcoin ETFs brought Bitcoin more into
[42:06] the mainstream conversation um I would
[42:09] always recommend that people get real
[42:11] Bitcoin not uh ETF Bitcoin but hey to
[42:14] each their own but it's incredible that
[42:17] we've come from that just an
[42:19] idea just an idea to something that is
[42:24] globally recognized now but is still so
[42:26] small I firmly believe we are still very
[42:29] very early but it's incredible that
[42:31] we've made it this far I look forward to
[42:33] seeing what what comes in the in the
[42:34] years to come absolutely I I talked with
[42:39] uh PR as you know him and and two other
[42:41] people at the main stage in Amsterdam uh
[42:45] about the Bitcoin Vision in 2050 and
[42:47] it's pretty fascinating to think about
[42:48] that because 2050 is 26 years from now
[42:53] that's the whole history of Bitcoin up
[42:56] till now just 11 years on top of uh
[43:00] already those 15 years that we have uh
[43:03] that's a that's a long time and a lot of
[43:05] things can happen it's really
[43:06] fascinating to think about that and yeah
[43:08] you said it I think we are still very
[43:09] early I think I'm by the way also class
[43:12] of
[43:13] 2020 um was I also saw it in 2017 the
[43:17] first time I got introduced to bitcoin
[43:20] through a pyramid scheme like an actual
[43:22] scheme uh built around Bitcoin and I'm
[43:26] glad that did not get into the pyramid
[43:28] scheme but i i b myself in the ass that
[43:33] didn't look into Bitcoin because I
[43:35] automatically connected uh scam with
[43:38] Bitcoin then and it took me three years
[43:40] to get over that uh that hurdle and
[43:42] that's that's
[43:44] a once you have once you're like
[43:47] researching like oh that thing is a scam
[43:49] and you did not look at Bitcoin per say
[43:51] you looked at the the the thing and then
[43:54] and then you have to go over like oh
[43:55] Bitcoin is not a scam it that was pretty
[43:58] pretty hard like that was an egoe
[44:01] moment no I mean and and I think that
[44:03] that is the case for so many people like
[44:07] even you look at more recent examples of
[44:09] FTX I mean how many times did you hear
[44:12] either in personal conversations or just
[44:14] in the Legacy Media the connection made
[44:16] between oh you know Bitcoin and S SPF
[44:20] FTX they're all lumped in together this
[44:22] you know and that's why I think
[44:23] separating Bitcoin from crypto is so
[44:28] very important yes Bitcoin is
[44:31] cryptocurrency it is the cryptocurrency
[44:34] uh it is the uh original cryptocurrency
[44:37] it is the only successful and real
[44:39] implementation of it so yes but it is
[44:42] not crypto I use crypto in quotes just
[44:44] to be very clear there but I think I
[44:48] feel I feel sorry for people who have
[44:52] been tricked into thinking that Bitcoin
[44:55] is just some scam that it is in any way
[44:58] associated with any one person that it
[45:01] is in any way connected to all of the
[45:04] financial crimes of people who have used
[45:07] Bitcoin and the name of Bitcoin to
[45:10] somehow legitimize themselves because
[45:12] those people who still believe that
[45:14] story that still believe that Bitcoin is
[45:15] a scam they will eventually adopt
[45:18] Bitcoin but like all of us they will get
[45:20] it at the price they deserve the Fiat
[45:22] price they deserve and that Fiat price
[45:26] seems to be going up and up and up and
[45:29] it will continue to rise at a very rapid
[45:32] pace and so I you know just right now I
[45:36] see that people still have a massive
[45:38] opportunity in Bitcoin and it doesn't
[45:40] have to be all of your net worth
[45:43] immediately especially if you're a
[45:44] younger person and you don't have very
[45:46] much net worth what I always recommend
[45:48] to people is just start dollar cost
[45:50] averaging just set up an automatic daily
[45:53] buy or or an automatic hourly buy you
[45:55] can do that on multiple platforms River
[45:57] or strike and even if you're just
[46:00] putting in a couple dollars a day that's
[46:02] something but you set it up you forget
[46:04] it and maybe you increase that DCA in
[46:06] the future but just setting up an
[46:09] automated DCA buy right now everybody
[46:11] who's been dollar cost averaging Bitcoin
[46:13] is massively in profit massively in
[46:16] profit in Fiat profit we all know that
[46:18] one Bitcoin equals one Bitcoin right but
[46:21] I think that it's so important right now
[46:22] for people to realize that you're not
[46:24] late you haven't missed the boat uh the
[46:27] party is not over it is just getting
[46:29] started we are so so early and how do I
[46:34] know this because the vast overwhelming
[46:37] majority of the world still doesn't own
[46:40] any Bitcoin not not even not not even
[46:43] one Satoshi that is the majority of the
[46:45] world we are early in the adoption curve
[46:48] and people still have a massive
[46:50] opportunity to be able to actually save
[46:53] the value of their time and their energy
[46:55] and their hard work in a money that is
[46:58] not perpetually debased by corrupt
[47:00] Central bankers and governments and you
[47:03] know if somehow you stumble upon this
[47:05] conversation and you're not a bitcoiner
[47:08] yet I encourage you just to set up a
[47:10] just set up a daily dollar cost average
[47:12] buy set it and forget it and increase
[47:16] that buy later when you're more
[47:17] comfortable but even even a dollar a day
[47:20] will will pay uh I would say I was going
[47:22] to say pay dividends but you know
[47:23] there's no dividends or cash flow in
[47:25] Bitcoin so it's a scam uh we still are
[47:28] so early and I just that's that's
[47:30] something I I try to really emphasize to
[47:32] people we're still at the very early
[47:34] stages but adoption can move quickly and
[47:37] I think it can is going to start to move
[47:39] even more quickly now that we have
[47:42] nation state recognition we had the
[47:45] freaking the the former and the next
[47:47] president of the United States at the
[47:49] Bitcoin conference in Nashville that's
[47:52] incredible that that's that's a
[47:55] historic paradigm
[47:57] shift these magic internet money nerds
[48:00] somehow got the leader of the Free World
[48:03] to come and try to appeal directly to
[48:07] them that is incredible and if you're on
[48:10] the outside looking in and you don't yet
[48:12] realize the significance of
[48:14] that you're going to be very shocked by
[48:17] what happens next so better to start
[48:19] dollar cost averaging now get some skin
[48:21] in the game and it doesn't have to be
[48:22] scary you know that's that's why I like
[48:24] dcing it's it's a easy low friction way
[48:27] to get some skin in the
[48:29] game I I was even more impressed that he
[48:32] uh got into pup key like that that was
[48:36] like he just got into like this random
[48:40] uh New York City pup Key Bar and buys
[48:43] with Bitcoin like that that seems to me
[48:47] um even bigger because of course like
[48:50] Bitcoin conference it's like really
[48:53] important voters block so you can say
[48:55] like yeah like he he just want to have
[48:57] but the PB key uh I think I don't know
[48:59] if if people outside of of Bitcoin
[49:02] really saw that and the mainstream media
[49:04] did not cover it that much the the
[49:06] Bitcoin conference everyone covered that
[49:08] he was there that that was the huge but
[49:10] yeah let's let's come to the I actually
[49:12] wanted to start today with that topic
[49:14] but 45 minutes in let's let's start with
[49:17] that topic now with the US election and
[49:19] and the implications of that first of
[49:21] all were you surprised that Bitcoin is
[49:24] such a huge Topic in us politics right
[49:28] now already uh because I was surprised
[49:32] because I know my European politicians I
[49:35] would be definitely surprised if they
[49:37] talk about that but were you surprised
[49:39] of that it was well let's say it was
[49:42] surprising in the sense that it it's
[49:45] amazing to see something like this
[49:46] happen like you can expect for something
[49:49] to happen but still be kind of blown
[49:51] away when it actually happens in reality
[49:54] you know not just some some pipe dream
[49:56] but I think it's also while it may be a
[49:58] little surprising it is somewhat natural
[50:01] and expected because money is inherently
[50:05] political right of course it is money is
[50:08] how everything gets done Fiat money is
[50:10] how the wars are funded and the bankers
[50:12] stay fat Bitcoin is political as well of
[50:17] course it is it's money it's the best
[50:19] money that we have ever discovered or
[50:22] invented whichever way you want to say
[50:23] it but it's money so of course Bitcoin
[50:25] is going to be political it's going to
[50:27] be a part of the political conversation
[50:29] Bitcoin is not partisan and I think that
[50:31] is important to emphasize Bitcoin is not
[50:34] associated with any political party but
[50:36] it is political and what I think is
[50:39] beautiful about Bitcoin is that Bitcoin
[50:41] is a mirror for whatever you want to see
[50:43] whatever your worldviews are if you're a
[50:45] conservative you look at Bitcoin and you
[50:47] see sound money you see a return to
[50:49] Common Sense in money you see a return
[50:52] to decentralization and limited power of
[50:55] governments if you're a quote
[50:57] Progressive you see something that is as
[51:00] Progressive as anything can possibly be
[51:02] which is the separation of money and
[51:04] state true transformation and open
[51:06] access to a truly Fair money for all so
[51:11] again Bitcoin is very political and it
[51:14] made sense to me that it was part of
[51:16] this conversation uh even last year RFK
[51:19] Jr was speaking you know he was the
[51:22] first candidate to accept donations in
[51:24] lightning or on the lightning Network
[51:26] Bitcoin followed shortly thereafter by V
[51:30] ramaswami who did the same thing on
[51:32] stage uh just a few hours after uh
[51:35] RFK but it made sense to me that this
[51:38] was part of this conversation because
[51:39] also the economic energy that bitcoiners
[51:42] have is growing
[51:45] exponentially yes uh the market cap of
[51:47] Bitcoin is still very small what like
[51:49] 1.5 trillion now with the latest
[51:51] all-time high something like
[51:53] that but that is growing exponentially
[51:56] and not only that uh bitcoiners are very
[51:59] good at memes and that may sound like a
[52:03] silly thing to say but you like Trump's
[52:07] first presidency was basically memed
[52:09] into existence his second presidency is
[52:11] going to have been podcasted into
[52:13] existence communicating information
[52:16] effectively is one of the most important
[52:19] skills that you can ever possibly uh
[52:22] ever possibly cultivate and bitcoiners
[52:24] have gotten really good at that because
[52:25] we've had to fight off so much
[52:28] disinformation targeted at Bitcoin over
[52:30] so many years and so many people have
[52:32] done I mean you know we've only been
[52:33] around for for four years here people
[52:36] have been doing this non-stop since it
[52:37] started they've been fud busting right
[52:40] and so being able to get really good at
[52:43] messaging getting really good at
[52:45] thinking about what are the actual game
[52:47] theoretical implications of Bitcoin when
[52:49] it comes to nation state adoption
[52:51] framing Bitcoin uh and you know shout
[52:53] out to to David Bailey and to all the
[52:56] people who
[52:57] got Trump to that conference who made
[52:59] that possible because I think that Trump
[53:03] realized after having enough bitcoiners
[53:04] in his ear that you know what this isn't
[53:07] something that I'm going to ignore or
[53:09] something that I'm going to uh somehow
[53:11] look down on and and think I can just
[53:14] forget about or squash under my boot and
[53:16] that was kind of his opinion if you
[53:17] listen to older clips of him you know he
[53:19] said I I I am a fan of the US dollar and
[53:22] not these other things competing with
[53:23] the these other cryptocurrencies
[53:24] competing with the dollar this was only
[53:26] few years ago it's a massive change that
[53:28] he's gone through thanks to bitcoiners
[53:30] getting in his ear and giving him the
[53:32] right kind of messaging so it makes
[53:36] perfect sense to me that we're now
[53:38] seeing this game theory of Bitcoin play
[53:40] out at the nation state level El
[53:43] Salvador is ahead of the game already
[53:45] they're a small country but their
[53:47] purchasing power and their economic
[53:48] energy is growing massively because they
[53:50] were the first mover now the question
[53:53] becomes who is going to be the first
[53:55] mover in terms of of the the g7s who's
[53:58] who's going to be the first mover that
[54:00] decides that can actually print their
[54:02] own currency you know El Salvador can't
[54:04] print their own currency they're
[54:05] dollarized right the United States we
[54:08] can print our own currency we have a
[54:10] fiat currency that we print out of thin
[54:11] air with a few keystrokes we don't even
[54:14] have to physically print it anymore it's
[54:15] beautiful right we can just just throw
[54:17] in a few more zeros and boom there it is
[54:20] thanks Jerome who's going to be the
[54:22] first major Giant geopolitical player
[54:25] that starts printing their own currency
[54:27] to buy Bitcoin I think that is the
[54:29] question right now and I think that
[54:30] everyone has been put on notice because
[54:32] of this us election because of the fact
[54:34] that Bitcoin actually played a
[54:36] non-trivial role in it you know did did
[54:39] Bitcoin get Trump elected you know you
[54:42] couldn't debate that it didn't hurt
[54:45] though and he got a lot of donations
[54:47] from bitcoiners a lot of donations from
[54:49] bitcoiners in Bitcoin a lot of
[54:51] bitcoiners gave put their both their
[54:53] voices and their economic energy behind
[54:56] him as a candidate and even if it moved
[54:59] the needle just a little bit it still
[55:01] moved the needle and so now I think
[55:03] every major country in the world and the
[55:05] small ones too are on notice that
[55:08] bitcoiners are a political force that
[55:11] cannot be ignored that Bitcoin is a
[55:14] monetary force that cannot be ignored
[55:17] you can try to ignore it but it's it's
[55:19] not going away and Bitcoin doesn't care
[55:22] if you adopt it or not but it's going to
[55:24] be in your best interest both as an
[55:25] individual but also as a nation state to
[55:28] be favorable to bitcoin and to cater to
[55:30] bitcoiners because bitcoiners I firmly
[55:33] believe are becoming and will become the
[55:36] most powerful and dominant political and
[55:38] economic force in the world in the years
[55:41] to come and that's that's not an if that
[55:44] is a
[55:45] when you you said something really
[55:48] interesting uh it didn't hurt him to to
[55:52] adopt Bitcoin I think that's really
[55:54] interesting because when you just look
[55:55] eight years back in 2016 when he was
[55:59] first time elected back then you could
[56:01] make an argument if he really went also
[56:04] to the Bitcoin conferences I mean eight
[56:06] years back Bitcoin was a whole different
[56:08] thing uh but but if he did it back then
[56:13] maybe it would have hurted him probably
[56:15] would have even hurted him because the
[56:17] general population was like why is that
[56:20] that that that the president promoting
[56:22] that weird internet thing that is just
[56:25] connected to criminal activities and and
[56:28] having all that electricity so like it
[56:31] it's amazing that he can win with being
[56:35] extremely bullish or like being for
[56:38] Bitcoin like that that fact alone is
[56:41] amazing and I think as as you also do
[56:44] that it moved the needle for him a
[56:46] little bit I mean in the end he he won
[56:49] by so much that he probably would have
[56:51] won also without Bitcoin I think so but
[56:54] uh it definitely benefited him and that
[56:57] alone is it's an amazing signal for the
[57:01] rest of the world because now every
[57:03] politician every leader knows okay I if
[57:07] I like Bitcoin I I I can be for Bitcoin
[57:10] I don't have to be afraid to stand up
[57:12] before Bitcoin it's the same thing that
[57:14] happened on the company level of micro
[57:15] strategy with all the other things now
[57:18] we now company slowly come on now micros
[57:21] Microsoft is is talking about it even
[57:24] though I'm not sure if they actually do
[57:26] it what was it Thoughts by away on
[57:28] Microsoft uh on Microsoft uh I think
[57:31] that it would be a very wise move for
[57:34] their shareholders to vote in favor of
[57:38] adopting Bitcoin because this isn't a uh
[57:41] just an opinion this is something that
[57:43] you can look at very objectively and
[57:45] empirically and say that look micro
[57:48] strategy has been the best performing
[57:51] company thanks to its Bitcoin strategy
[57:54] that this is undenied able right is
[57:57] since they adopted Bitcoin they've
[57:58] outperformed Nvidia like this is you
[58:02] have hard data to back this up and you
[58:05] also have literally thousands of hours
[58:06] of podcasts of Michael sailor going in
[58:08] explaining this in detail he didn't do
[58:10] this in the shadows he didn't try to
[58:12] hide his his Bitcoin strategy he made it
[58:15] very very public anyone can follow this
[58:17] blueprint he's open sourced it
[58:19] essentially this doesn't have to be
[58:21] complicated this is very obvious I think
[58:24] for any company but I think mic strategy
[58:26] was in a unique position in that that's
[58:28] still a founder-led company right
[58:30] Michael sailor was a Founder he was CEO
[58:32] of it for what 30 years one of the
[58:34] longest running Tech CEOs like in
[58:37] history and he has a lot of sway there
[58:40] Microsoft or Google uh those are not
[58:44] founder Le companies anymore those are
[58:47] companies or an apple you know uh Tim
[58:50] Tim Cook did not found Apple any of
[58:53] these companies that have a CEO or or
[58:56] you know
[58:57] CFO uh executive board that doesn't have
[59:01] true skin in the game that is more of a
[59:03] hired a Hired Gun to come in and do a
[59:06] job they may view it as being too much
[59:08] career risk to adopt Bitcoin but I
[59:10] honestly think that it's at the point
[59:12] where if you have the opportunity as a
[59:14] large company to adopt Bitcoin which all
[59:17] of them do the biggest career risk for
[59:20] you is not adopting Bitcoin because it
[59:23] is going to seem painfully obvious in
[59:25] the year to come it should already be
[59:27] obvious but just in case it's not these
[59:29] next four years will certainly show that
[59:31] those companies that do not adopt
[59:33] Bitcoin are not going to perform even
[59:36] close to as well as those that do and
[59:40] you know you would hope that there would
[59:42] be enough people with the foresight to
[59:43] see that but again this is an indication
[59:45] of how early we are not all you know all
[59:48] the Fortune 500 companies don't have
[59:50] Bitcoin on their balance sheet that's a
[59:52] good thing for you as an individual it
[59:53] means you're still early so you know we
[59:55] can can look at it that way it'd be a
[59:57] good thing but I wanted to touch on the
[59:58] political side just to add one other
[60:00] thing to that which is I think it's
[60:02] becoming very clear we know that Bitcoin
[60:04] doesn't care right Bitcoin doesn't
[60:06] Bitcoin can't care it's an open protocol
[60:08] it doesn't have needs desires wants
[60:10] hopes dreams it just is Tik Tok next
[60:14] block right Bitcoin does not need
[60:17] politicians but politicians do need
[60:20] Bitcoin it does not pay to be anti-
[60:23] Bitcoin it will hurt you to be anti anti
[60:26] Bitcoin and it will ultimately hurt your
[60:29] constituents who you purport to
[60:30] represent if you are anti- Bitcoin so
[60:33] Bitcoin doesn't need you but you
[60:35] definitely need Bitcoin and that's
[60:37] another thing that I think is starting
[60:38] to become painfully obvious but again uh
[60:42] everybody becomes Pro Bitcoin at the uh
[60:44] at the price they deserve
[60:46] right absolutely it's um it's it's the
[60:51] same discussion basically for every
[60:53] level like it even on an individual
[60:57] level if if you're just like um in a
[61:01] family you kind of have
[61:04] the uh obligation to now look into
[61:07] Bitcoin if you're a family individual if
[61:10] you're Corporation if you're nation
[61:11] state leader like no matter what level
[61:14] you are it will be painfully obvious in
[61:18] four to eight years that you would have
[61:22] to adopt Bitcoin right now and you can
[61:25] make an argument that like8 years ago uh
[61:28] it was a different story it was not that
[61:31] obvious but now like there is Bitcoin
[61:34] ETFs there's publicly traded companies
[61:36] there's a president talking about it
[61:38] like like it it can never be more
[61:41] obvious um probably probably this year
[61:45] is the best risk reward uh year ever in
[61:50] Bitcoin history because we're still so
[61:52] early from prize and adoption but like
[61:56] we have everyone in there I always say
[61:58] that we we kind of laid in the first 15
[62:01] years the groundw work we have all those
[62:03] buckets uh buckets being Bitcoin in that
[62:06] example with like Bitcoin ETFs with the
[62:08] nation states with the individuals with
[62:10] the corporations and now we just wait
[62:12] till the water is falling into those
[62:14] buckets and filling up till till they
[62:16] are so full that we need more buckets so
[62:19] H it's it's kind of obvious to me and
[62:23] people are waking up I get actually
[62:25] calls from um a friend of a friend of a
[62:29] a couple which is like 60 years old and
[62:31] they're like oh we we heard about that
[62:34] the euro is not that stable anymore and
[62:36] we we're just wondering if if Bitcoin
[62:38] might be a good diversifier and I'm like
[62:41] since black Hol started to say it's a
[62:44] unique diversifier all of the sudden uh
[62:46] this narrative actually comes into the
[62:48] mainstream media from people that are
[62:50] completely outside of like they're not
[62:52] Financial gurus they're not like uh in
[62:55] inside the the the the Cyber hornet
[62:58] they're just like a a a cute older
[63:00] couple uh which uh were concerned about
[63:04] the savings and once they come in uh
[63:07] that then it gets extremely obvious and
[63:10] still so early so like it's ah I'm
[63:14] getting very excited but uh it's it's
[63:16] the the coming years will be crazy well
[63:19] I think it's I I agree it's it's
[63:22] important to remember to like what Odell
[63:24] says you know you you want to stay
[63:26] humble in stack SATs right that is some
[63:28] of the best Bitcoin advice I think that
[63:30] anyone has ever given stay humble you
[63:33] know don't dance too much and uh and
[63:36] stack SATs DCA because this is what I
[63:40] think people need to realize this is
[63:42] kind of this is the last monetary
[63:44] Revolution right this is the last zero
[63:47] to one moment that that we're going to
[63:49] have this is the final battle the final
[63:52] boss we know that Fiat currencies all
[63:56] Trend to zero in the long run every fiat
[63:59] currency ever has done that every fiat
[64:01] currency that comes after will Trend to
[64:04] Zero versus Bitcoin Bitcoin is the final
[64:07] measuring stick gold was the measuring
[64:09] stick for 5,000 years and a very good
[64:12] one at that but an imperfect one and
[64:16] Bitcoin has perfected Gold's
[64:18] imperfections and the fact that we have
[64:20] we are sitting here at this moment in
[64:23] space and
[64:24] time this is an incredible time to be
[64:26] alive because you get to be here as we
[64:29] transition from it's a 5,000-year change
[64:32] that you seeing happen Fiat was Fiat was
[64:35] not a a change right Fiat was a little
[64:39] uh a little what do you want to call
[64:41] like a uh Fiat was just a freakout it
[64:44] was a a spasm it was something it was an
[64:48] aberration we've had gold for 5,000
[64:51] years and now we have Bitcoin you are
[64:54] alive at this moment to watch this
[64:56] transition happen you are alive and with
[64:59] the opportunity to freely opt into
[65:01] Bitcoin and you can still just buy it on
[65:03] an exchange you don't even have to earn
[65:05] it yet you know you can trade your
[65:07] depreciating fiat currency for Bitcoin
[65:11] at market price that's incredible and I
[65:15] think that it's also important to point
[65:16] out that this revolution is very
[65:18] different revolutions I think that most
[65:21] revolutions throughout history are
[65:23] actually monetary revolutions most
[65:26] collapses of Empires are actually
[65:27] monetary collapses the Roman Empire is
[65:29] an example of a Empire collapsing for
[65:32] monetary reasons the French Revolution
[65:34] is an example of a revolution that
[65:36] happened because of monetary failings
[65:39] right this is going to be a bloodless
[65:42] monetary Revolution and that's really
[65:44] important there's no Force that's
[65:46] required to make Bitcoin succeed force
[65:49] is required for fiat currency every fiat
[65:52] currency must be backed with the threat
[65:54] of violence or people will not use it
[65:57] unless there is violence at stake people
[66:00] have no reason to use Fiat currencies
[66:02] and you can say oh well come on they're
[66:05] just asking you to pay your taxes in it
[66:07] what's violent about that try not paying
[66:09] your taxes and see what happens they
[66:11] will come and they will put you in jail
[66:13] if you resist being thrown in jail they
[66:15] will hurt you that is violence okay we
[66:19] have a bloodless Revolution the
[66:21] potential for a bloodless Revolution and
[66:23] that is really powerful but it's only a
[66:25] revolution for you if you actually opt
[66:27] into Bitcoin if you actually take the
[66:29] time to study it and to realize that
[66:31] this gives you so much power as an
[66:34] individual and I I truly believe that
[66:36] Fiat is sort of an immoral aberration
[66:39] too because theft is immoral right they
[66:43] Fiat steals from you they print out of
[66:45] nothing what you need to work your
[66:48] entire life to earn that is immoral
[66:51] Bitcoin is moral money Bitcoin allows
[66:54] you to actually protect protect your
[66:56] time and energy protect your work that
[66:59] is so important and so powerful and I
[67:02] hope that more and more people start to
[67:04] realize this uh before every nation
[67:07] state gets on board before every company
[67:09] gets on board because that's great I
[67:10] love to see it but I care more about the
[67:12] individuals adopting Bitcoin I care
[67:14] about my friends and family and
[67:16] strangers on the internet adopting
[67:18] Bitcoin that I think is uh that well
[67:22] that's why we need more Bitcoin
[67:24] podcasts it's
[67:26] it's interesting because we we kind of
[67:29] cheered that Trump is gonna get
[67:31] president and we get like those that
[67:33] Bitcoin movement but at the same time
[67:36] like maybe it would have been better if
[67:38] CA was there uh maybe they would have
[67:40] dumped all the Bitcoin would have G
[67:42] given us more time to actually acquire
[67:45] more Bitcoin because if they like the C
[67:48] Lumis uh bill it's also something that I
[67:50] want to talk with you about if that
[67:52] actually passes and now like the
[67:53] Republicans have the president the house
[67:56] and the Senate uh house I think it's not
[67:59] sure if they actually have it but
[68:01] probably they have all all three things
[68:04] um so if if if that thing passes this
[68:08] says that they will acquire 1 million
[68:10] Bitcoin that's a massive amount first of
[68:12] all like I don't know um if if they
[68:14] actually do that maybe the price shoots
[68:16] up so much that they they come they
[68:18] lower their targets but they have the
[68:20] spending power to definitely acquire 1
[68:22] million Bitcoin it's just four times of
[68:25] micro
[68:27] strategy uh but but that that that
[68:30] implication uh is huge what what's your
[68:33] thoughts I mean I thought it was so
[68:36] interesting at the Bitcoin conference
[68:38] lumus actually came out on stage
[68:40] directly after Trump so everybody's
[68:42] starting to leave the auditorium you
[68:44] know they're they saw Trump now they're
[68:45] they're leaving and I felt almost felt
[68:47] bad because she's trying to yell over
[68:48] the top of them to basically say hey she
[68:51] you know I've got a bill in my hand that
[68:53] that is very explicit about establishing
[68:55] a big Bitcoin strategic reserve and
[68:56] everyone's kind of like oh yeah I saw
[68:57] Trump okay I'm out of here but that was
[69:00] really important and I think that again
[69:04] people uh it's easy to get hung up and
[69:06] say ah well you know I thought you
[69:09] bitcoiners wanted the separation of
[69:10] money and state but now you're just you
[69:12] know cuck holds for the state and hoping
[69:14] for nation state adoption and the
[69:16] reality is that nation state adoption
[69:18] was going to happen anyway of course
[69:20] that was going to happen but regardless
[69:22] this is still the separation of money
[69:24] and State because it's still the
[69:25] separation of the control of issuance of
[69:28] money from State and that's just I
[69:29] wanted to make that that clarification
[69:32] also as far as nation state adoption
[69:33] goes I would much rather have the US Go
[69:36] full in on bitcoin before China does
[69:39] personally I think that the US's values
[69:41] are superior to China's I think the US
[69:44] is a Bastion of freedom in a world that
[69:46] Trends towards authoritarianism I think
[69:48] that the US's American values are unique
[69:51] in this world and that because of those
[69:53] us values the entire world has benefited
[69:56] from the massive amount of success that
[69:58] American entrepreneurs have
[70:00] created there wanted to preface that
[70:03] what do I think about that bill
[70:05] specifically I think it's probably going
[70:08] to happen realistically I think that it
[70:11] would be uh many bitcoiners will feel
[70:13] very betrayed if it does not happen
[70:16] given that in the United States there's
[70:19] a Trum Trump is going to be the
[70:20] president there's a republican majority
[70:22] in the senate in the house they have
[70:24] they have all three there's no excuse
[70:26] for them not to now I also trust
[70:29] politicians as far as they I can throw
[70:31] them I think Trump was a superior choice
[70:35] for president to kamla uh but I still
[70:38] recognize that as although Trump is a
[70:40] businessman he is a politician right now
[70:43] right so I believe things when I see
[70:46] them right don't trust verify we we've
[70:48] said it enough times we should be able
[70:50] to remember that here when it comes to
[70:51] politicians and especially politicians
[70:53] that you may like I think we should be
[70:55] especially doubtful if somebody promises
[70:57] us everything we've ever wanted because
[71:01] you know it's it's easy to make promises
[71:03] they're cheap talk is cheap actions have
[71:06] real value actions are your proof of
[71:08] work and so we'll see what happens um I
[71:11] I would Hazard a guess to say that it a
[71:14] Bitcoin strategic Reserve will happen in
[71:16] the United States and I think that it
[71:19] will happen in the United States first
[71:21] compared to let's say uh Russia China
[71:24] but again the game is on the game is a
[71:27] foot this is Game Theory playing out the
[71:29] first mover from the large Nations will
[71:32] have a massive first mover Advantage
[71:35] this is the reality you can print a
[71:37] currency out of thin air and buy an
[71:39] absolutely finite unconfiscatable
[71:43] uncensorable
[71:45] money why wouldn't you do that and why
[71:49] wouldn't you want to be the first to do
[71:51] that and so I think it's HP going to
[71:53] happen for all major Nations eventually
[71:56] the question is who's going to get there
[71:58] first I personally as an American hope
[72:01] the United States of America gets there
[72:02] first and we'll see what happens but the
[72:05] race is on right now and I don't think
[72:08] anybody no country can ignore this
[72:12] now the only thing that I might see is
[72:15] like maybe like country like like like
[72:18] maybe Dubai or like Saudi Arabia maybe
[72:22] like they see that I'm like hey like he
[72:24] he's coming in
[72:26] January let's do quickly some some
[72:28] buying like that that's not out of the
[72:29] question and maybe some smaller
[72:31] countries it's it's the same thing so so
[72:34] interesting to see those things because
[72:36] um when you have now America probably
[72:39] doing that uh and you have on the same
[72:43] side also like big corporations doing
[72:45] that like Microsoft at least playing
[72:47] with that idea um then you go ahead and
[72:50] see like if you're are now a small
[72:53] publicly traded company or you smaller
[72:55] nation state same thing uh you're like
[72:59] hm they're talking about it maybe
[73:01] they're not doing it right now maybe it
[73:03] takes a year but if it's an in
[73:06] availability and they actually go ahead
[73:09] and do it I would massively benefit if I
[73:12] do it now so I would not be shocked if
[73:14] like smaller nation states actually went
[73:16] ahead and do it and the same thing
[73:18] happening with corporations where like
[73:20] uh smaller or medium-sized publicly
[73:23] traded companies are just like like hey
[73:26] how how did that Michael sailor folk do
[73:28] it let's let's just copy that maybe not
[73:30] that aggressive but let's just uh do
[73:32] something with that I would not be
[73:33] shocked if that happens I think I think
[73:36] and we're we're seeing that happen right
[73:38] now too uh let's let's take El salador
[73:41] out of the picture because they were uh
[73:43] the most forward thinking they were the
[73:45] first mover na Buell was ahead of
[73:48] everybody else in that regard but let's
[73:50] look at other countries that are doing
[73:52] that we know that the kingdom of Bhutan
[73:54] has been mining Bitcoin they were doing
[73:55] it kind of in secret for a while but
[73:57] they've been mining Bitcoin with Excess
[73:58] hydr power for a couple years now we
[74:01] know that uh large publicly traded
[74:03] Bitcoin miners in the US have deals with
[74:06] uh with Saudi Arabia and and other you
[74:08] know large oil producing Nations and at
[74:11] the uh corporate level we know that
[74:13] similar scientific as one example has
[74:15] already started adding Bitcoin to their
[74:18] balance sheet we know that uh meta
[74:19] planet in Japan has started doing the
[74:21] same and seeing a very large benefit
[74:24] from that and so I think that you're
[74:25] exactly right it's easier for these
[74:29] smaller countries these smaller
[74:30] companies to see the writing on the wall
[74:33] which is very clear right now and to
[74:35] take advantage of that because they are
[74:37] smaller they're more Nimble they're more
[74:39] agile there's less people involved in
[74:41] the decision-making process there's less
[74:44] bureaucracy involved and so there is
[74:47] actually I think a massive uh equalizing
[74:50] force that happens thanks to bitcoin
[74:53] because of that exact reason because
[74:54] large comp companies and large Nations
[74:57] by definition move more slowly and so
[75:00] smaller Nations smaller companies have
[75:03] an outsized advantage in that they can
[75:05] see what the large nations are
[75:07] projecting they will do and say well
[75:09] let's let's just do it first and reap
[75:11] many more of the rewards why not what do
[75:14] we have to lose and I think we're going
[75:16] to continue to see that playing out
[75:18] we're going to see it intensify as well
[75:19] I think I don't know about the timeline
[75:21] for the US adopting a strategic reserve
[75:24] and the Bitcoin that the US currently
[75:26] holds is obviously not actually theirs
[75:28] it belongs to uh for example the uh you
[75:32] know users of bitfinex uh from the large
[75:34] bitfinex hack they should give it back
[75:36] to bitfinex and then let bitfinex
[75:38] distribute that to the people it's
[75:39] actually owned by so that's when when
[75:42] Trump said in his speech at Nashville oh
[75:44] we're going to keep all the Bitcoin we
[75:45] currently have my first thought was well
[75:47] that's stolen Bitcoin that's not yours
[75:50] uh the US government should not do that
[75:52] they should give that Bitcoin back and
[75:53] if you're going to acquire it mine it
[75:56] print money for it do whatever you're
[75:57] going to do but at least don't steal it
[75:59] the government steals enough already
[76:00] they don't need to steal people's
[76:02] Bitcoin
[76:03] too absolutely I
[76:06] mean the the chances of them giving it
[76:08] back I don't know about American
[76:10] politics but uh probably they will keep
[76:13] it I don't know that that I can't say I
[76:17] would hope that they give it back uh
[76:19] because it would just seem to be I mean
[76:21] but it's also it's the government like
[76:24] the the state is the state is the state
[76:26] they're they produce nothing themselves
[76:28] everything that they have must
[76:30] necessarily be stolen because the state
[76:31] is not a productive institution I don't
[76:34] care who is at the Helm of the state or
[76:36] what state is there you know what state
[76:38] it is in the world a state is and cannot
[76:42] be productive they produce nothing
[76:44] themselves all that they have is stolen
[76:47] uh and is available to them because they
[76:50] have the power to enforce violence to
[76:53] legally enforce violence because they
[76:56] have perverted the law for their own
[76:57] ends but now I
[77:00] digress absolutely it's it's uh it's uh
[77:04] so so so interesting to talk about that
[77:07] will be I will watch American politics
[77:11] uh probably more than I should in the
[77:13] next few years like like with the
[77:15] elections uh because I'm not an American
[77:17] so but it's interesting for for Bon and
[77:20] I think it's uh something that actually
[77:24] right now it seems be more popular but I
[77:26] think in general
[77:28] bitcoiners um we always say like Bitcoin
[77:31] doesn't care about politics you also
[77:32] said that and that's true like Bitcoin
[77:34] itself doesn't care about that but you
[77:36] as an individual are still in that
[77:39] jurisdiction and uh they can do a lot of
[77:41] damage to you so like for for you you
[77:44] have to be aware of of politics for your
[77:46] own sake and for your family's sake um
[77:49] your Bitcoin will be fine maybe they uh
[77:52] maybe they do things that uh hurt you
[77:55] but Bitcoin in general they will be fine
[77:58] but what do you have from your Bitcoin
[78:01] if you are not fine so I think being
[78:03] aware of bit politics is an important
[78:06] thing no I I I completely agree with
[78:09] that there's that that old saying you
[78:11] know you may not care about politics but
[78:13] politics cares about you like you're
[78:15] right bit Bitcoin doesn't care uh but uh
[78:18] but as an individual of course you
[78:20] should care and I think what I hope that
[78:22] we see in the years to come is more a
[78:25] trend towards uh you know we have a
[78:27] decentralized money now I hope that we
[78:29] see more of a trend towards
[78:30] decentralizations of our political power
[78:32] structures because honestly the worst
[78:34] government is the biggest government and
[78:36] the best government is the smallest
[78:38] government things should be done more
[78:40] locally governments State apparatus are
[78:43] more effective locally your local
[78:46] community your state you know in Europe
[78:49] there's now this Behemoth of
[78:51] centralization which is the European
[78:53] Union and the European Central Bank I
[78:57] hope that we see more European countries
[78:59] say you know what this hasn't really
[79:01] been that good for us this you know what
[79:05] what has this actually done for us
[79:06] except mandate that we use their
[79:08] depreciating currency that they have you
[79:11] know commanded from on high that they
[79:12] have brought into existence through Fiat
[79:15] and I hope that in the United States we
[79:16] see more of a trend towards states
[79:19] rights being uh first and foremost the
[79:22] federal government in the United States
[79:24] was never meant to be this big it was
[79:26] never meant to be this powerful and
[79:27] again the best government is the
[79:29] smallest government possible the bigger
[79:32] any bureaucracy gets the less efficient
[79:34] it gets and it's already not efficient
[79:37] because it exists based on theft and so
[79:40] I hope that we see and that bitcoiners
[79:43] champion a move towards decentralizing
[79:47] power structures focusing more on
[79:49] localism focusing more on the things
[79:51] that are directly around you that you
[79:53] can control that you can influence cuz
[79:54] you can have a huge influence locally or
[79:57] at the state level uh or at the country
[79:59] level if you're you know in Europe and
[80:01] and your country is not that big uh but
[80:05] at least we have Bitcoin that makes a
[80:07] lot of that possible it gives power back
[80:09] to the individual and that's the first
[80:11] step because without that again we go
[80:13] back to the if they can control the
[80:14] money they can control you they can't
[80:17] control Bitcoin so if you use it in a as
[80:21] Sovereign a way as possible if you hold
[80:23] your own keys if you you know do some
[80:26] regular uh regular security checkups if
[80:28] you're mindful about how you take care
[80:30] of this if you utilize incredible
[80:32] Technologies like multisig uh to reduce
[80:35] you know threat vectors against you
[80:37] you're going to be okay but the
[80:40] beautiful thing here is that the more
[80:42] people that are okay the more bitcoiners
[80:44] that there are that no longer have to
[80:46] live hand to mouth that no longer have
[80:48] their purchasing power destroyed by
[80:50] inflation the more that frees up their
[80:53] minds not to focus on running on that
[80:54] Fiat hamster wheel anymore but to focus
[80:57] on actually growing on building on being
[81:01] sounds cheesy but on being the change
[81:03] that they want to see bitcoiners have
[81:06] the power to do that and because we
[81:08] don't have to use their their currency
[81:11] anymore we can build the parallel
[81:12] systems that we want and I think that
[81:16] any of these centralized systems any
[81:18] existing power structure is never going
[81:20] to be changed fundamentally from the
[81:23] inside out you're not going to get
[81:25] inside the Beast and change the nature
[81:26] of the Beast the only way the Beast
[81:28] changes is through external pressure
[81:31] from parallel systems and that's what
[81:34] Bitcoin and other open protocols like
[81:35] noer enable us to create they enable us
[81:37] to create parallel systems that can
[81:41] force that existing centralized system
[81:43] to change because of the pressure that
[81:45] is put on it from the outside because it
[81:47] is a we're building better systems than
[81:49] they
[81:50] have I 100% agree with that and
[81:55] I can just report because I watched some
[81:57] of the politics things um the EU
[82:00] critical parties in Austria are growing
[82:03] in Austria in in Europe are growing
[82:06] rapidly we kind of just like had two
[82:08] days ago the government in in uh Germany
[82:13] ended like they they will have earlier
[82:16] uh new elections uh and a party that is
[82:21] rising that says like we are extremely
[82:23] critical of the you and maybe even want
[82:25] to end it it's currently the second
[82:28] biggest in in Germany uh and in Austria
[82:32] the same one the the most critical EU
[82:34] party actually won the last election um
[82:37] so like this is something I see in the
[82:40] whole EU actually where those who are
[82:42] critical of the EU uh and critical of
[82:45] what's going on also with like the
[82:46] digital Service Act and all those things
[82:49] that the EU did um they are raising
[82:52] awareness and to put it I I feel like
[82:54] the political landscape is Shifting like
[82:57] it's not only America it's it's
[82:59] something that is in the whole uh world
[83:02] to see and it it will be really
[83:04] interesting to see I still have like I'm
[83:07] on the verge of not being in a I'm like
[83:10] okay I'm in the EU they're doing a lot
[83:12] of things and and I don't like what's
[83:14] going on uh at the same time I have my
[83:16] my family my friends here I'm really
[83:18] rooted in Austria and I really do like
[83:20] the country like it's it's such a
[83:22] beautiful country um so
[83:25] I right now I'm at the moment where I'm
[83:27] like let's see where it goes like I'm
[83:29] really watching closely what the the PO
[83:31] politics in Austria do but right now
[83:34] it's it's it's in the right direction
[83:36] but if it goes in the wrong direction
[83:37] I'm like oh okay let's let's see another
[83:39] country El Salvador would be uh
[83:42] interesting and should be also beautiful
[83:45] have you have you been to El Salvador
[83:46] yet I actually leave uh three days in
[83:50] three days like I leave for adopting
[83:52] Bitcoin uh and will be the first time
[83:54] ever in El Salvador uh because the
[83:57] pressure has been building up in my
[83:59] podcast uh people have been asking oh
[84:00] have you been there I was like okay I
[84:03] should go at least once and I will be at
[84:05] adop in Bitcoin and in three days my my
[84:07] plane is leaving that's it's a it's a
[84:10] great country and that's a great
[84:11] conference too uh Carl and I have been
[84:13] to El Salvador twice now we'll be going
[84:15] back in January for the uh Plan B El
[84:18] Salvador Edition down there but it's
[84:21] you're going to really enjoy yourself
[84:23] there's an error of hope and optimism uh
[84:26] about the future that is very palpable
[84:28] and very contagious there uh and it's
[84:31] going to be amazing to see like they've
[84:33] the changes that they've made uh under
[84:36] na buk in just a couple of years like
[84:39] it's still been a very short time since
[84:42] you know uh he started cracking down on
[84:44] crime since they started adopting
[84:45] Bitcoin of course no country is without
[84:48] its problems but they've gone a long way
[84:51] towards fixing a lot of theirs and it's
[84:54] going to be incredible to see you know
[84:55] talk about the next 10 15 20 50
[84:58] years El Salvador I think will be
[85:01] unrecognizable in and I mean that in the
[85:03] most positive way possible that's that's
[85:05] what I what I hope at least absolutely
[85:09] when I when I heard those stories the
[85:12] from people coming onto my podcast and
[85:14] and and saying like how was Salvador
[85:17] 2019 2018 and how is elab now in 2023
[85:21] 2024 that has been like oh wow I should
[85:25] I want to see that I want to see that
[85:27] with my own eyes what's going on there
[85:29] and that's where I was like okay let's
[85:31] let's see if if I can make it and it's
[85:34] it's a it's a lot of work because I'm
[85:37] myself with with the podcast and I do it
[85:38] every day uh so if I'm a whole week away
[85:42] and I just assume that I cannot do a
[85:43] podcast there like not editing and stuff
[85:45] like that so I this week I do like
[85:49] double the work that I usually do which
[85:52] is insane but I I'm still sane
[85:55] hopefully um so just to make it into
[85:58] Salvador but it's definitely worth it
[86:00] like I I I I'm really looking forward to
[86:02] the trip it's like Christmas for me this
[86:05] is Sao trip yeah and it's a I mean good
[86:08] time of year to go weatherwise too uh we
[86:11] we went twice we we went just for uh
[86:14] basically like a a vacation in
[86:16] 2022 uh just uh around a little less
[86:20] than a year after Bitcoin became legal
[86:22] tender there and just went around I got
[86:25] to meet uh Roman uh Martinez Chima uh
[86:28] who is uh very active in the Bitcoin
[86:31] Beach Community and has done incredible
[86:33] work down there and he took us out to uh
[86:36] to one of the schools uh where we were
[86:39] able to basically see the the lessons
[86:41] they go through I mean they go in and
[86:43] they're they've now as uh Bitcoin
[86:45] integrated into their curriculum uh uh
[86:48] John Den with me Premier Bitcoin has
[86:49] also done incredible work down there but
[86:52] they go and they're actually educating
[86:53] their youth about Bitcoin um and seeing
[86:56] these kids the incredible thing about it
[86:58] was you know they're working with these
[86:59] kids to set up their lightning wallets
[87:00] and to do these things and you know
[87:01] we're we're sending these kids SATs and
[87:04] how quickly they pick up on the things
[87:06] that you know a like a a boomer it's
[87:09] it's foreign to them these kids just get
[87:11] it like that and it's incredible to see
[87:13] this kind of stuff this Outreach being
[87:15] done but also these curriculums being
[87:17] actually implemented into their school
[87:19] systems that's an incredible thing to
[87:21] see these kids are ahead of the game uh
[87:23] even though they were born in a country
[87:25] that was was not going to give them a
[87:27] lot of advantages at the time they were
[87:29] born now they're seeing some advantages
[87:31] they're seeing that they can be uh ahead
[87:33] of the rest of the world when it comes
[87:35] to this zero to one monetary moment of
[87:38] Bitcoin and that is very powerful I'm
[87:42] I'm excited to see what uh El Salvador's
[87:44] future has in store we liked it so much
[87:46] in the first couple weeks we spent there
[87:48] they asked us to come to adopting
[87:49] Bitcoin like a month or two later we
[87:51] were like okay I guess we're going back
[87:52] to El Salvador let's let's do it it's a
[87:54] it's a great conference too absolutely
[87:57] yeah the the biggest danger there for me
[87:59] is like maybe I stay that's that's for
[88:02] me the May biggest the threat for me
[88:05] they they certainly make it very
[88:06] tempting you know for for me it's like
[88:09] you're in auster I'm in the United
[88:11] States uh I know a lot of bitcoiners are
[88:14] like looking at okay I'm going to you
[88:15] know move out of whatever country I'm in
[88:17] and move into a more a friendly
[88:19] jurisdiction and I absolutely see that
[88:21] and you know depending on how things go
[88:23] politically in your country maybe that
[88:25] is the best move uh there's also
[88:27] something to be said I think for being
[88:29] really proud of the country that you are
[88:30] from and for trying to stay and make
[88:33] things better there uh you know
[88:35] sometimes your government may not give
[88:37] you a choice and you do need to get out
[88:38] of there and that's that's a sad day if
[88:40] that comes but I'm sure you have a lot
[88:42] of you know Pride uh in your country I
[88:44] have a lot of pride in in being American
[88:46] I think everybody should have national
[88:48] pride like that's a that's a good thing
[88:51] uh it's you know having those diverse
[88:52] cultures and different types of Nations
[88:55] out there that's a beautiful thing you
[88:58] know we're a we're a diverse we're a
[88:59] diverse World um America by itself is an
[89:02] extremely diverse country because we're
[89:03] a nation of risk-taking entrepreneurial
[89:06] immigrants that fled a lot of countries
[89:08] that they didn't like uh and so yeah I I
[89:12] have hope I have a lot of Hope For
[89:14] America I would have had hope regardless
[89:15] of who was elected to clarify uh I think
[89:19] again uh Trump was a better choice than
[89:21] kamla but regardless of who is in the
[89:24] political highest political office in
[89:26] the United States I have hope because
[89:28] the American idea is not dependent on a
[89:30] person the American idea is an idea
[89:33] ideas are bulletproof that's powerful I
[89:36] mean you can't kill an idea and the
[89:38] American idea the American dream is an
[89:41] incredibly powerful one and one that I
[89:43] think bitcoiners American bitcoiners
[89:45] really uh are now stepping up and
[89:47] fighting for that gives me a lot of Hope
[89:49] in the future I'm I'm extremely
[89:51] optimistic not just about America about
[89:53] the World in general I think we've been
[89:55] in a strange period where centralization
[89:59] was increasing authoritarianism under
[90:01] the guise of democracy you know quote
[90:03] democracy was increasing censorship uh
[90:06] you know monetary repression was
[90:09] increasing but we're now we're we're
[90:12] going to enter a new era I believe an
[90:14] era that is much more free uh it may get
[90:17] really nasty before that I'm not saying
[90:20] it's all going to be cupcakes and
[90:21] daisies and you know uh sweet smelling
[90:24] perfume it's going to get pretty nasty
[90:26] probably in a lot of places in the world
[90:29] but ultimately we now have the tools to
[90:31] create a better world out of the ashes
[90:33] right we have the tools the the
[90:35] incredible open protocols to be able to
[90:37] build something better From the Ashes of
[90:40] what was before from this Fiat system
[90:42] and that's why I'm hopeful we've got a
[90:44] bright future ahead of us we just have
[90:45] to uh we just have to make that's
[90:48] beautiful and I think that's an amazing
[90:51] um end to the podcast even though we
[90:53] have two more questions uh one question
[90:56] that is always the same question for
[90:57] each guest um and the question is what
[91:01] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin H
[91:05] uh well let's see I'm very passionate
[91:09] about homeschooling uh I don't have a I
[91:12] have a son right now he's not of
[91:13] homeschooling age yet he is uh only 10
[91:16] months old but I was homeschooled myself
[91:20] and I firmly believe that this is a
[91:22] really great path for people to go down
[91:26] I think that the best education that you
[91:27] can get is in the home from your parents
[91:30] who love you very very much and the
[91:33] older I get the more grateful I am to my
[91:34] own parents for this and I think that
[91:37] also in a uh a trend towards
[91:40] centralization is only broken by a
[91:43] competing Trend towards
[91:45] decentralization this is true in money
[91:46] this is true in social media this is
[91:48] true in education our education systems
[91:51] have become tools of Indo ation by the
[91:55] state uh I released uh talked about this
[91:58] with American Hodel and Eric kase just
[92:01] yesterday but you know the some of the
[92:04] biggest pushers of public school systems
[92:07] were the Nazis um it was illegal it's
[92:10] still illegal in Germany I'm not sure
[92:11] about Austria but it's still illegal in
[92:13] Germany to homeschool your kids that
[92:15] policy started with the Nazis because
[92:17] they wanted to be able to control the
[92:20] public school system to control what
[92:21] kids were taught to control the
[92:23] indoctrination
[92:24] system which is what public schooling
[92:25] has
[92:27] become that's kind of a crazy thing that
[92:30] you could imagine that still today it
[92:31] would be illegal to educate your child
[92:33] as you choose in your own home in any
[92:36] country I'm grateful it's not illegal in
[92:39] America and I would very much recommend
[92:42] for anybody that has the ability and all
[92:45] bitcoiners will have this ability you
[92:47] will be able to afford to only have one
[92:49] parent working because you are saving
[92:52] the value of your time and energy in a
[92:54] truly scarce money which is Bitcoin
[92:57] because of that we will be I think we're
[92:59] going to see a massive homeschooling
[93:01] boom we're already seeing this uh in the
[93:02] United States covid kind of helped a lot
[93:05] with that but in the UK as well in other
[93:08] countries people are realizing that you
[93:10] don't need to send your kid to eight
[93:12] hours a day of sitting in a chair and
[93:15] following rules public school is not how
[93:17] you create not not to say that everyone
[93:19] that comes out of public school is some
[93:21] you know obedient lemming of course not
[93:24] but that system is not meant to cre to
[93:29] Foster creativity to Foster free
[93:31] thinking to Foster freedom of spirit and
[93:34] expression it is meant to create
[93:37] obedient dutiful rule followers who will
[93:41] go and work until they die or fight
[93:45] until they die and this all goes back to
[93:47] the Prussian system of Education which
[93:49] was the original model for compulsory uh
[93:52] public education
[93:54] and so I could I I I I don't want to go
[93:56] too deep down that rabbit hole but I
[93:58] would encourage uh I would encourage
[94:00] people to read John Taylor gado he has
[94:03] several books about homeschooling and he
[94:05] was a public school teacher for
[94:07] award-winning public school teacher in
[94:08] New York for 30 or 40 years so he's seen
[94:13] you know he's been inside the belly of
[94:14] the Beast uh but he has some very very
[94:18] good books it's yeah John Taylor got I
[94:21] would really recommend people check out
[94:23] those books and they're pretty easy
[94:24] reads they're pretty short uh so you
[94:26] know spice up your Bitcoin book reading
[94:28] with some John Taylor gado learn about
[94:31] the what the public school system is
[94:33] doing uh and if you want you know you
[94:35] can't be uh yeah uh let me see yep you
[94:39] got him right there yeah so he's he's
[94:42] got some really excellent
[94:43] books but that's the thing you know we
[94:46] talk we talk about uh in Bitcoin we talk
[94:48] about sovereignty a lot and I think
[94:50] sovereignty is always going to be a
[94:51] spectrum you can never be truly purely
[94:54] 100% Sovereign right because you could
[94:56] you know this a very easy thing to go
[94:58] down think of like the you know if
[95:00] you've read the essay I pencil you know
[95:03] you're never going to be able to control
[95:05] every single thing in your life you can
[95:07] take control of parts of them you can
[95:09] take control of your money you can take
[95:12] control of your ability to publish
[95:13] online through you know so Bitcoin for
[95:15] money Noster for uh
[95:17] publication you can take care control of
[95:20] some of your food by growing your own
[95:21] food but you're not going to create
[95:23] every input that goes into making your
[95:25] existence but one thing that you
[95:27] definitely can control is how your
[95:29] children are educated and what kind of
[95:32] education and from whom they receive and
[95:35] I think that you know maybe
[95:36] homeschooling is not for everyone uh but
[95:39] I am very grateful to my parents for
[95:41] doing it I also then made the decision
[95:44] to go to public school uh in high school
[95:46] after being homeschooled so I've seen
[95:47] both sides of things and I will tell you
[95:50] homeschooling is a better option again
[95:53] I'll never tell anyone what to do or
[95:54] what's best for them that's that's a
[95:56] decision for them to make but the
[95:57] beautiful thing about the world that we
[95:59] live in today is that you have all of
[96:01] the resources you could ever possibly
[96:03] need to homeschool your kids right here
[96:05] or in your computer the internet is a
[96:07] beautiful place and we have so many
[96:09] tools that were not available when I was
[96:11] being homeschooled and somehow my mom
[96:14] and dad still did it and they had no
[96:16] experience in it so you out there
[96:18] listening you can do it too and uh make
[96:21] that choice or don't Bitcoin doesn't
[96:24] care and I don't either but that's
[96:26] that's something you you can learn
[96:27] that's a it's a deep Rabbit Hole when it
[96:29] comes down to the Prussian system of
[96:31] Education excuse me or indoctrination
[96:33] and uh and compulsory schooling and why
[96:36] compulsory schooling was made compulsory
[96:40] it all comes down to control of
[96:41] information and the ability to create
[96:43] dutiful soldiers of the party so if you
[96:46] want your kids to be freethinkers then
[96:49] homeschooling might just be a better
[96:51] option for them and it's czy to think
[96:54] about that the state uh basically takes
[96:57] away your kid for a period of uh time
[97:02] each day which is like oh W it's it's
[97:05] your kid like you you should be able to
[97:08] decide if he goes to school or not
[97:10] nothing against public school I myself
[97:12] went to a public school but it should
[97:14] not be mandatory like the the state
[97:17] should not be able to take away your kid
[97:20] that should be a choice and not
[97:22] mandatory
[97:24] that that's I I don't think you can if
[97:26] your if your country does not allow you
[97:28] does not at least give you the option of
[97:30] homeschooling your kids I don't think
[97:33] that's a free country how how can it
[97:35] possibly be if you will be put in jail
[97:38] and your kids will be taken away if you
[97:41] don't send them to a state
[97:42] indoctrination Camp eight hours a day
[97:45] that's
[97:46] insane and people should not put up with
[97:48] it apparently it's possible somewhere in
[97:51] Austria I just checked I never looked it
[97:53] up because yeah yeah I'm fairly certain
[97:56] fairly far away from from kids with like
[97:58] my my 25 26 years old now uh may maybe
[98:02] in the next few years but uh yeah I will
[98:05] research if it's possible in Austria I
[98:08] know that there's some form of
[98:11] homeschooling but I think it's like you
[98:14] still have to follow some curriculum and
[98:16] you still have to go give the exam there
[98:18] or something like that but at least I
[98:21] never really looked into that I just
[98:23] know from from a very young cousin of
[98:25] mine that they have some uh colleagues
[98:29] that are just sometimes in the school uh
[98:32] and they are mostly um uh homeschooled
[98:35] so maybe there's some hybrid model going
[98:37] on in in Austria most of the the the
[98:42] political Solutions in Austria like ah
[98:44] not that and not that hey a hybrid model
[98:47] is better than absolutely mandatory
[98:50] compulsory schooling you know that's at
[98:52] least a step in the right direction
[98:53] because I think it all comes down to
[98:55] like you're if you are truly a free
[98:58] individual you the state should not be
[99:00] able to tell you what to do with your
[99:02] kids that's just insane and I think it's
[99:05] a very easy Line in the Sand to draw to
[99:08] say no these are not our children
[99:11] collectively they're my children and you
[99:14] should be able to raise them and teach
[99:16] them how you want to teach them and
[99:18] ultimately they're going to be smarter
[99:21] because of it and more creative because
[99:23] of it
[99:24] and more well-rounded because of it and
[99:26] more resilient and have more grit
[99:28] because of it so that's that's my that's
[99:30] my non-bitcoin related rant on
[99:33] homeschooling uh beautiful it's actually
[99:35] a topic that comes up fairly often like
[99:39] every 20th episode or something like
[99:41] that homeschooling it's it's it's great
[99:43] I even made with Lisa half um whole
[99:46] episode just around parenting uh and I
[99:49] loved it like we we I I looked
[99:52] afterwards in the transcript
[99:54] we mentioned Bitcoin like four times or
[99:56] five times just a comparison the my
[99:59] Michael saor episode had Bitcoin word
[100:02] 214 times in there so like in one
[100:05] episode we mention Bitcoin over 200
[100:09] times uh so four is really
[100:12] low that that that's awesome no I I
[100:14] think that these things uh these things
[100:17] are important to talk about because you
[100:18] know Bitcoin is one part of this
[100:20] equation it enables us to do so much it
[100:22] gives us
[100:23] it allows us to move along that spectrum
[100:25] of sovereignty in a positive direction
[100:28] but there are so many other aspects to
[100:30] this whether it be childhood education
[100:32] whether it be health and you know
[100:34] dietary habits or exercise or just
[100:37] getting out and taking a walk in the
[100:38] sunlight whatever it might be there's
[100:40] other things you can do to improve your
[100:42] sovereignty the sovereignty of your mind
[100:44] body and your
[100:45] money absolutely she she framed it so so
[100:48] nice she said like we have to raise
[100:51] non-compliant kids in a compliant world
[100:53] like something like that she I love that
[100:56] also she this is
[100:58] awesome amazing perfect then let's come
[101:00] to the end routine of of the podcast
[101:02] where the previous guest is asking a
[101:03] question for the next guest without
[101:04] knowing who the next guest actually is
[101:07] and your question from the previous
[101:08] guest is uh will Bitcoin coexist with
[101:12] the US dollar or will Bitcoin overtake
[101:15] and be uh alone the the currency of the
[101:18] world it's a great question I think that
[101:20] this may be an unpopular opinion but I
[101:23] think that Fiat currencies will always
[101:26] exist I think that governments will
[101:28] always create Fiat
[101:31] currencies with that said Bitcoin
[101:34] provides a check on those Fiat
[101:36] currencies and badly managed Fiat
[101:39] currencies will fail faster uh and I
[101:42] would also say if the US dollar has
[101:44] failed if I then probably every other
[101:47] current fiat currency in the world has
[101:49] already failed uh the US dollar is the
[101:52] the prettiest horse at the glue factory
[101:54] it's the skinniest kid at fat camp uh it
[101:57] it is the the best of the worst but I I
[102:00] think that Fiat currencies will continue
[102:03] to exist they will coexist with Bitcoin
[102:06] but you will actually have a check on
[102:07] them because you can actually measure
[102:10] and you can measure that fiat currency
[102:12] against the finite and perfect ruler of
[102:14] 21 million
[102:16] Bitcoin and people will have a better
[102:19] escape hatch they will not be stuck with
[102:23] just their country's Fiat they have the
[102:26] option to opt into Bitcoin to use
[102:28] Bitcoin so I would say that uh Bitcoin
[102:31] will have more users let's put it that
[102:34] way uh in not this year not next year
[102:37] probably not in 20 years maybe in 20
[102:39] years but it will have more users than
[102:41] any individual fiat currency uh at some
[102:44] point in the future but I do not think
[102:46] that every fiat currency will go away
[102:49] forever uh but perhaps I'm wrong we'll
[102:52] see I just believe that governments will
[102:55] continue to utilize Fiat currencies for
[102:58] their own means uh but who knows in a
[103:02] perfect world maybe governments would
[103:05] shrink shrink shrink down and become
[103:07] much much smaller and wouldn't see the
[103:10] need to issue their own Fiat currencies
[103:13] but we'll see I think they're going to
[103:14] coexist for a while maybe by the year
[103:16] 2140 when that last block is mined maybe
[103:19] all Fiat will be gone I don't know I'll
[103:21] be gone too so I I think in in my
[103:24] lifetime though we'll still have Fiat
[103:25] currencies but maybe not the US dollar
[103:27] maybe it'll be uh the us will have
[103:30] dissolved into individual states maybe
[103:33] they'll each have their own Fiat
[103:34] currencies I don't
[103:36] know my my father is exactly born in
[103:40] 1971 like this is his birth year and and
[103:43] my hope is that he outlives the the Fiat
[103:47] system that would be one amazing story
[103:50] but it's it's the one Topic in Bitcoin
[103:52] why I'm so undecided like I I researched
[103:55] in in both directions and I had so many
[103:58] guests on guests who said like 100% feed
[104:01] will always be there and guess who said
[104:03] like 100% feed is gone in like five
[104:06] years and uh it's it's it's a topic
[104:09] where I'm like oh like I have I
[104:10] have no clue like seriously it's um I
[104:15] I'm 100% completely without opinion on
[104:19] that topic yeah I I I I I do not know
[104:23] you know um I would say that to add on
[104:27] to what I said before just that while
[104:29] Fiat currencies may not disappear that
[104:32] does not mean that Fiat currencies or
[104:34] any Fiat is going to be the world's
[104:36] Reserve currency I think Bitcoin will be
[104:38] the world's Reserve money uh I think
[104:41] that that will happen in our lifetimes I
[104:43] think that may happen much sooner than
[104:45] we think uh but again that does not mean
[104:48] that Fiat currencies will disappear it
[104:50] just means that a fiat currency is no
[104:52] longer the reserve currency of the world
[104:55] and so I think that that is the more
[104:56] likely scenario Fiats exist but no Fiat
[105:00] is the reserve currency Bitcoin is the
[105:02] reserve
[105:03] currency absolutely yeah and and by the
[105:05] way I think we have the third longest
[105:07] podcast on my uh on my podcast like this
[105:11] second or third or fourth longest like I
[105:13] usually don't go that long but it was
