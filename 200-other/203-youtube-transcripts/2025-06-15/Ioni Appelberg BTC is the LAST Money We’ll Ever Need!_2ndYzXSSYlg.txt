[00:00] Bitcoin is final money it's the last
[00:02] form of money Humanity will ever need
[00:04] for as long as we need money the entire
[00:06] economic system that we have right now
[00:08] is not geared towards production it's
[00:09] geared towards zombie corporations and
[00:12] uh shortterm gains and just consumers
[00:15] everything that is wrong with the world
[00:17] today stems from the fact that we are
[00:18] living in a Fiat system Bitcoin could be
[00:20] the exact opposite of what we want it to
[00:22] be if we are not careful and take
[00:25] privacy uh very very seriously Bitcoin
[00:28] will always exist as the discovery of
[00:30] absolute mathematical scarcity it's
[00:32] pretty incredible to have front row
[00:34] seats to the greatest economic
[00:36] transformation in the history of our
[00:37] species and I don't say that lightly cuz
[00:40] we're also simultaneously we have front
[00:42] row seats to the greatest civilizational
[00:46] collapse in the history of our species
[00:48] when you don't have good money Society
[00:50] doesn't work we are now living through
[00:52] the financial Dark Ages we have broken
[00:54] money that is used as a surveillance
[00:55] tool we cannot be in a worse place
[00:58] having weak money makes us weak because
[01:00] it undermines our potential to
[01:03] coordinate and collaborate to the best
[01:05] of our abilities there is an ongoing war
[01:08] on privacy perhaps the most important
[01:10] war in bitcoin's history makes the blog
[01:13] size Wars look like a snowball
[01:15] [Music]
[01:18] fight it's so fascinating I use when I
[01:21] explain Bitcoin and the essence of
[01:23] having sound money I usually use doctors
[01:26] as an example because if you have uh a
[01:29] sound money
[01:30] it's amazing you can just like do your
[01:32] job and Save in your sound money and you
[01:34] don't have to be a portfolio manager on
[01:36] the side and usually like if you are on
[01:38] a day job and you are saving lives
[01:40] during the day you don't want to have
[01:42] being a portfolio manager when you come
[01:44] home because saving lives and being a
[01:46] doctor whatever you're doing in the
[01:47] medical uh scenes is enough already and
[01:51] it's so funny because I never spoke to a
[01:52] doctor on my podcast but I use doctor
[01:54] quite often as an example for that
[01:56] there's a first for everything yeah so
[01:58] this is the idea popularize by safine uh
[02:01] in in the Bitcoin standard because it's
[02:04] really is symptomatic of a a broken
[02:08] economy when someone who has an
[02:10] education like a doctor or or if you're
[02:12] a lawyer or whatever it is uh something
[02:15] that took you five six seven years of
[02:18] school and then years of practice and
[02:20] then you still have to to either gamble
[02:22] on the market or or become an investment
[02:26] um you have to be knowledgeable uh in in
[02:30] investing and that's just not it's not
[02:32] doable it speaks to the state of the
[02:35] economy more than anything else
[02:37] absolutely yeah and you wrote a book uh
[02:39] I think the the the title in itself is
[02:41] is amazing abundance through scarcity
[02:44] it's a good title I love it a lot like
[02:47] uh it's it's I think you're the first
[02:49] title I was like why didn't nobody
[02:52] thought about that title before it's
[02:53] it's an amazing title um but the the
[02:56] question that comes up I think that's
[02:58] the the main question do you want to
[02:59] answer in the book is like why does that
[03:01] fixed money scarce money uh give us an
[03:04] abundant life on on an individual level
[03:06] or even like on a society level well
[03:08] this is uh the premise of the entire
[03:11] book uh and takes you from the fall of
[03:16] the Roman Empire and into the future and
[03:19] looks at
[03:20] how the different states of the economy
[03:24] has how the economy has evolved over uh
[03:27] since the Roman Empire and up to today
[03:29] from the Denarius
[03:31] to uh commodity money of different kinds
[03:35] and into the uh gold standard into the
[03:38] Fiat economy and then into
[03:41] Bitcoin and it's pretty clear that when
[03:46] money is cheap and abundant then
[03:50] everything else is going to be scarce
[03:51] and this is the uh this is essentially
[03:54] the Jeff boo price of Tomorrow
[03:56] thesis that the economy should
[03:58] inherently be deflationary but it can
[04:01] only be if money is hard and because if
[04:04] we keep expanding the monetary Supply it
[04:07] will um we will have uh more and more
[04:12] dollars chase chasing the same amount of
[04:14] goods and
[04:16] that's there's no production in that the
[04:20] the entire economic system that we have
[04:22] right now is geared uh is not geared
[04:25] towards production it's geared towards
[04:28] um s corporations and and uh
[04:32] shortterm um gains and just consumerism
[04:36] absolutely and in order to escape that
[04:38] whole system the I mean it's everything
[04:42] that we see everything that we have
[04:45] everything that is wrong with the world
[04:46] today stems from the fact that we are
[04:47] living in a Fiat
[04:50] system and the Bitcoin is basically the
[04:54] reverse of that it's uh just getting
[04:57] away from cheap money
[05:00] which will
[05:01] change uh our culture our mind our how
[05:05] how we act in the world uh it will
[05:07] change everything so this this is the
[05:10] central thesis of the
[05:12] book yeah I love that that thesis is
[05:15] really cool that there is like this
[05:17] underlying fundamental basis of Our
[05:20] Lives which is like money because we use
[05:22] it to to exchange energy basically uh
[05:26] and when we exchange that and it's not
[05:28] something that um losing value or
[05:31] stealing value better I like I like to
[05:34] pronouncing more like stealing value not
[05:36] losing value um but it it gives us
[05:39] actually energy over time which is an
[05:41] amazing concept and it's it's hard for
[05:44] people that are so used to fear to like
[05:47] grab like oh there can actually be money
[05:49] that uh doesn't devalue I think that
[05:52] concept is especially for people that
[05:54] haven't been in the Bitcoin space and
[05:56] that haven't been uh down the rabbit
[05:58] hole of sound money really hard I know
[05:59] people that have studied economics or
[06:01] even entrepreneurs who like yeah we need
[06:04] uh inflation to trigger the economy we
[06:07] trigger trigger growth and stuff like
[06:09] that that that that thought is so deep
[06:11] in in our society in hand it sometimes
[06:14] fascinates me how uh we we can actually
[06:18] think
[06:19] that Central Authority stealing our
[06:22] purchasing power is good for uh the
[06:24] economy somehow it's it's it's backwards
[06:27] we we got the economy entirely backward
[06:29] words it has become something that it
[06:31] shouldn't be like just some basic
[06:35] concept about the economy that that are
[06:38] like to Norm is seem uh seem normal but
[06:43] it's it's like it's really strange how
[06:46] strange our economy is for example uh
[06:49] just a thought I had just an hour ago
[06:51] like you know how like the physical
[06:54] counterpart of a digital fiat currency
[06:55] is a feature not a bug but the
[07:00] non-existence of a physical counterpart
[07:02] in Bitcoin is also a feature not a bug
[07:06] and the reason for this dichotomy is
[07:07] that Bitcoin is decentralized and sens
[07:10] censorship resistant by Design and the
[07:13] only way to avoid surveillance and the
[07:15] risk of censorship in a centralized
[07:18] authoritarian monetary system like the
[07:20] fiia system is with cash but we don't
[07:23] have that cash does not exist uh like
[07:27] here in Sweden for example the the
[07:29] entire the Fiat economy is completely
[07:32] digitized and that's where it's going so
[07:35] money originally had three functions
[07:38] right it's supposed to be a store value
[07:41] a medium of exchange and a unit of
[07:43] account but recently as Andreas
[07:46] Antonopoulos popularized also the it
[07:49] gained a fourth function and that is
[07:51] financial surveillance so
[07:54] uh that was some that was something that
[07:58] was always inherent in in the in a
[08:00] centralized economy so uh but and and
[08:04] Fiat money isn't really cash
[08:08] also I think that it's an important
[08:11] distinctions to make we call Bitcoin
[08:13] digital cash because because it is it's
[08:15] cyber cash a term that I'm R
[08:17] romanticizing more than digital cash
[08:20] cyber cash cash is a form of money it's
[08:23] a form of money cash is a form of money
[08:26] that's that's universally accepted as a
[08:28] medium of exchange and and whose
[08:30] function is to settle debt immediately
[08:32] so technically
[08:34] Fiat money
[08:37] isn't cash Fiat cash isn't cash because
[08:41] it doesn't settle debt so when when you
[08:45] and I transacting Fiat we're just
[08:47] letting debt shift hands so we're never
[08:50] actually settling anything we're just
[08:52] moving debt around so and that's because
[08:54] Fiat is a currency it's not money you
[08:56] can't settle debt with a currency uh you
[08:59] you can't settle debt with
[09:01] debt
[09:03] so you need money to settle debt that's
[09:05] what money does money is an extinguisher
[09:07] of
[09:08] debt and Bitcoin is money Bitcoin is
[09:12] also cash because it settles debt
[09:14] immediately upon transaction so and
[09:16] there's really nothing there there's
[09:18] really nothing exciting about this this
[09:20] is just how it should always have been
[09:23] but our monitor technology the Fiat
[09:25] system got so got corrupted along the
[09:27] way and rated into this this figured
[09:32] Beast that is the Fiat
[09:34] system so Bitcoin in a way is just the
[09:37] way back to normal just a way back to
[09:40] normal life yes exactly it's just back
[09:43] to normal that's exactly what Bitcoin is
[09:45] that's a that's an interesting I think I
[09:48] never thought about that like I always
[09:49] thought like it's the evolution of money
[09:51] it's some a progress of money but it's
[09:53] actually like just just going back to a
[09:56] normal sense it's it's it's Vanishing
[09:59] the out of the system and going back to
[10:01] a normal State I love Fiat currencies uh
[10:05] the Fiat system the entire Fiat system
[10:07] was I it gets a bad rep
[10:10] but it was absolutely
[10:14] necessary the reason the Fiat system
[10:17] came about in the first place and the
[10:19] reason um was because we were
[10:22] globalizing the economy we couldn't use
[10:26] gold because gold is hard and expensive
[10:29] to transfer it's slow
[10:32] essentially and we needed less money
[10:35] with less friction in a globalized
[10:38] economy and that's where the Fiat system
[10:41] was born and it has served us incredibly
[10:45] well up until now now the
[10:49] world has evolved past the Fiat system
[10:52] and as the world has evolved past the
[10:54] Fiat system it's like we it's like Fiat
[10:57] were these Rock boosters that brought us
[11:00] to a certain altitude and
[11:03] then now it's time to Dr to drop those
[11:06] rocket boosters because now we're in the
[11:08] actual spaceship which is
[11:10] Bitcoin and Bitcoin I've argued this
[11:13] multiple times is final money it's the
[11:18] last form of money Humanity will ever
[11:20] need for as long as we need money even
[11:21] like in in in thousands and hundreds of
[11:23] thousands years there there there will
[11:26] always be be Bitcoin that is how I see
[11:29] it
[11:29] uh because what Bitcoin is like here
[11:32] here's the thing what we have to make
[11:34] the distin distinction between Bitcoin
[11:36] and the ecosystem of Bitcoin so what
[11:39] Bitcoin is at the most fundamental level
[11:42] is the discovery of absolute
[11:44] mathematical scarcity and that will
[11:46] always be underneath the actual uh
[11:50] ecosystem but then we will build you
[11:53] know uh wallets and have the network and
[11:57] all of these things and
[11:59] and it uh that layer the entire
[12:03] ecosystem can we can mess that up we can
[12:07] mess that up and I think we are at a
[12:11] very critical time in bitcoin's history
[12:15] where we are right now battling the most
[12:18] important war in bitcoin's history which
[12:20] is the the battle of the right to
[12:24] privacy because privacy is not baked in
[12:26] into the base layer it is and it's not
[12:29] something that we should even have to
[12:32] ask it's something that we're born with
[12:34] we are born with our right uh to privacy
[12:37] it's just something that is inherent
[12:39] it's something that that we have as
[12:41] human beings it's not something that can
[12:43] be given to us it can't be given to you
[12:46] it's just something that you are born
[12:48] with the right to privacy it's like your
[12:50] right to your
[12:52] Consciousness uh or the right to your
[12:54] body it's not something that the
[12:56] government or anybody else can give to
[12:57] you they can only take it away from you
[12:59] and they do but there's no such thing as
[13:01] giving people rights they only such a
[13:03] thing as taking rights away from people
[13:06] and we're right now at this Crossroads
[13:09] with Bitcoin where there's the the uh
[13:13] the war for for privacy technology and
[13:17] there's this big government clamp down
[13:19] on privacy technology as we saw with the
[13:21] samurai wallet and now also with um Duro
[13:25] um Paulo Duro uh the telegram CEO
[13:29] so this is a it's it's a sad State of
[13:33] Affairs that we're in currently but this
[13:36] is just our current iteration of the
[13:39] Bitcoin ecosystem that is undergoing
[13:42] this this uh transformation this
[13:44] Evolution I think that we will come out
[13:46] out on top I think the cipher punks will
[13:49] eventually Prevail because they are
[13:51] Cipher punks and you don't bet against
[13:54] them but we could also
[13:57] see the
[14:00] uh the case where the entire Bitcoin
[14:03] ecosystem is essentially captured
[14:07] corrupted hijacked by a state by the
[14:10] state and used for a massive orwan
[14:15] dystopian surveillance tool Bitcoin
[14:18] could be the exact opposite of what we
[14:21] want it to be if we are not careful and
[14:24] take privacy uh very very
[14:28] seriously and we are right now in the
[14:30] midst of this war and we we could lose
[14:32] this battle uh in which case Bitcoin
[14:35] could become uh the worst thing to ever
[14:38] happen to humanity but we are uh this is
[14:42] only the ecosystem of Bitcoin Bitcoin
[14:44] will always exist as the discovery of
[14:47] mathematical absolute mathematical
[14:49] scarcity it's like a new fundamental
[14:51] constant in the universe that we have
[14:54] discovered uh like
[14:56] zero it's uh it's even even more
[14:59] important than zero it's absolute
[15:02] mathematical
[15:04] scarcity in cyberspace this has never
[15:07] existed before it's never going to exist
[15:09] again in some other forms it's just it
[15:11] is it's you don't discover uh the speed
[15:14] of light twice there's not going to be
[15:16] another speed of light and there's not
[15:18] going to be another absolute
[15:20] mathematical scarcity of
[15:21] Bitcoin um and on top of this discovery
[15:25] we've built the Bitcoin Network and we
[15:27] can in if if this iteration of the the
[15:30] ecosystem turns out to be too fragile
[15:35] and it's hijacked by the state and it
[15:37] becomes this dystopian or well in or
[15:40] well in dystopian surveillance tool
[15:43] then in 300 years 400 years a thousand
[15:48] years absolute mathematical scarcity
[15:50] will still be there available for us to
[15:54] rebuild a new ecosystem much like the
[15:59] spark of humanity didn't disappear with
[16:02] the fall of Rome or with with the fall
[16:04] of any Empire or civilization we rebuild
[16:07] that's what we do and we and we're
[16:10] better each time so you're saying uh
[16:14] there's a chance that bitcoin's
[16:16] ecosystem gets captured but not Bitcoin
[16:18] itself as Bitcoin is uncapturable like
[16:21] how are you until we are like a like a
[16:25] cardish type four type of a civilization
[16:27] that can actually manipulate at the the
[16:30] fundamental laws of the universe we are
[16:33] not going to to be able to uh change
[16:37] Bitcoin Bitcoin is it's like the you're
[16:41] not going to manipulate the number zero
[16:43] you're not going to manipulate the speed
[16:45] of light you're not going to manipulate
[16:47] I like that I also feel I also see it
[16:49] see it like that it's also crazy um when
[16:51] you think about that Bitcoin actually
[16:53] could be there for hundreds and
[16:54] thousands of years uh and and basically
[16:58] till till till till the end whatever
[17:02] this is it's money it's it's it's
[17:05] fascinating to think that we actually
[17:06] live through the time where Bitcoin
[17:09] wasn't existing and it was not there uh
[17:13] and then it's it's here or or do you see
[17:16] Bitcoin was always already always here
[17:18] and we just discovered it like yeah B
[17:20] Bitcoin was always here it just had an
[17:22] infinitely low hash rate so so so we
[17:25] discovered it then yeah um exactly we
[17:29] Bitcoin is is the discovery of absolute
[17:31] mathematical scarcity and how we
[17:32] Implement implement it uh is up to you
[17:35] uh but it's the discovery of absolute
[17:37] mathematical scarcity and if alien
[17:41] civilization discover absolute
[17:43] mathematical scarcity in the digital
[17:44] world as well uh they could you do
[17:47] something else with it we we are using
[17:48] we are calling it Bitcoin and we are
[17:50] building an economic operating system on
[17:52] it we're building the new world economy
[17:55] an entire economic operating system and
[17:58] and cannot stress how incredible it is
[18:02] to uh have a second a new economic
[18:06] operating
[18:07] system um people don't fathom how How
[18:11] Deeply this impacts the world uh I mean
[18:15] the world as we perceive it is
[18:16] essentially the economy and we have a
[18:18] new entirely New Economic operating
[18:20] system which is just a a fascinating
[18:23] fascinating idea how different let me
[18:25] ask you this way when we have now a
[18:28] world that that has Bitcoin discovered
[18:31] already uh but only a small portion of
[18:35] the world actually knows about Bitcoin
[18:37] and how how powerful it is um what
[18:41] changes when everyone knows how powerful
[18:44] it is and it is normal as air and it's
[18:46] normal as as now field money is normal
[18:49] um what what does this change how does
[18:51] this abundance uh uh look like uh if if
[18:55] we come to that state I'm very
[18:56] optimistic by Nature I look forward to
[18:58] the future
[18:59] but I can't predict the future in any
[19:01] way I'm not going to pretend to I don't
[19:02] know what a what a Bitcoin IED like a
[19:05] hyper bitcoinz future looks like it is
[19:08] already a Bitcoin ised economy and we
[19:10] are undergoing hyperbitcoinization as we
[19:12] speak I cannot foresee the downstream
[19:16] effects of this nobody can we can
[19:18] pretend to and we can make all kinds of
[19:19] cool sci-fi scenarios um from
[19:23] it but what I do say will say is that
[19:27] it's pretty incredible to have front row
[19:29] seats to the greatest economic
[19:32] transformation in the history of our
[19:33] species and I don't say that lightly we
[19:36] because we're also Sim simultaneously we
[19:39] are we have front row seats to
[19:44] the greatest civilizational collapse in
[19:48] the history of our species we have been
[19:50] on a civilizational decline since the
[19:53] 197 70s since the 1970s uh so 50 years
[19:58] we've been de declining and
[20:00] civilizations naturally e and flow uh
[20:02] through through declines and progress
[20:05] declines are sometimes severe and
[20:08] sometimes very dangerous because they
[20:09] can lead to collapse and they have many
[20:11] times throughout history there's always
[20:14] some kind
[20:15] of like when an economy naturally
[20:19] declines which which we have since the
[20:21] 1970s we see this because we all have um
[20:25] we all have a smaller claim on the
[20:28] economy compared to like our
[20:30] grandparents for for instance like when
[20:33] when my grandparents were younger than
[20:35] me they could live on one income have
[20:40] four kids a car go on vacation once a
[20:43] year save some money for the future and
[20:47] do all that on one income today you need
[20:51] two incomes to live in an
[20:54] apartment uh and have a
[20:56] pet I mean the the the it's ridiculous
[20:59] we have more technology but we are uh
[21:03] our living standards are comparatively
[21:06] lower and that is uh that is because the
[21:10] money is
[21:11] broken uh sorry I went on a tangent what
[21:14] was your question what were we talking
[21:15] about I was uh asking how Hab conization
[21:20] world look like yeah right right right
[21:21] yeah we are right now we have front row
[21:26] seats to the end of civil Iz ation which
[21:29] is a fascinating place to be and it's
[21:34] epic we have been in a decline since the
[21:38] 1970s and this time this decline could
[21:42] lead to collapse but when what we see in
[21:46] previous Empires that have collapsed is
[21:50] that there's a convergence of war
[21:54] pandemics and broken money it's a
[21:57] trifecta
[21:58] and when you don't have good money
[22:02] Society doesn't work you we need
[22:04] money
[22:06] to
[22:08] coordinate our resources and our
[22:10] Workforce and to collaborate across
[22:13] distances and
[22:15] time money really is a fascinating
[22:19] magical technology it lets us coordinate
[22:22] our Global Workforce and our global
[22:25] resources and it lets us coordinate our
[22:28] efforts across distances and
[22:32] generations which is uh which is
[22:34] fascinating and I
[22:36] mean when money fails in an economy
[22:40] their
[22:41] coordination is going to
[22:44] falter and the complexity within that
[22:47] Society is going to collapse to the
[22:50] level that can be
[22:52] sustained by the amount of coordination
[22:56] that is permitted by the money
[22:59] so there's sort of a direct correlation
[23:01] between how hard the money is and how
[23:04] well functioning it is and comp
[23:06] complexity of society that it can
[23:08] sustain meaning
[23:10] that if you have good
[23:13] money hard money infinitely hard money
[23:16] which Bitcoin is it's infinitely hard
[23:18] there's nothing else that can ever be
[23:20] harder there's 21 million
[23:23] Bitcoins and it's
[23:25] um it's there's no friction in in when
[23:29] we transact
[23:31] so uh it's frictionless it's infinitely
[23:35] hard and it's Immortal
[23:38] this allows
[23:40] for uh human creativity and and it
[23:44] allows for Humanity to really flourish
[23:47] to to become what we can with with the
[23:51] Fiat system we have to fight against
[23:53] ourselves our our inner demons uh our uh
[23:58] our our greed
[23:59] or the hate we have towards ourselves
[24:02] but Bitcoin gives us an environment
[24:05] where we can really flourish as a as a
[24:07] species infinitely hard money when money
[24:09] is truly scarce and not just scarce it's
[24:14] fixed that means that we can optimize
[24:16] our coordination and
[24:19] collaboration across distance and time
[24:22] without uh needless and pointless
[24:25] distractions and like zombie
[24:27] corporations and cheap credit and and um
[24:31] High Time preference
[24:34] Behavior it means that we can truly
[24:36] florish as a species in that kind of
[24:38] environment and there are all kinds
[24:41] of all kinds of Futures we can
[24:44] imagine uh going forward in a Bitcoin
[24:46] IED economy and I'm sure that all of
[24:48] them will be pretty great it's
[24:50] fascinating because it seems like we it
[24:54] seems like the feat system we're in is
[24:57] like the kind of the
[24:58] ages uh and and and Bitcoin is is is
[25:02] this like small orange light that guides
[25:05] it us out like that was kind of the the
[25:08] picture that I got when when you were
[25:09] talking about the field system and and
[25:11] and the Bitcoin system that we are going
[25:14] towards I like the comparison a lot and
[25:16] how how you put it really really cool um
[25:20] one thing sorry go ahead no I was just
[25:22] going to say I think you're spot on that
[25:24] we are now living through the financial
[25:26] Dark Ages we have broken money that is
[25:29] used as a surveillance Tool uh we cannot
[25:31] be in a worse place with this current
[25:34] economic operating system so you know it
[25:38] really it really gives you hope about
[25:40] the future when we have something like
[25:41] Bitcoin where we we can get rid of all
[25:44] of like the worst of humanity which is
[25:46] found in the Fiat system one extremely
[25:50] fundamental thing uh when you think
[25:52] about money is time time and money and
[25:55] energy the are like the three things are
[25:57] kind of all
[25:59] interconnected uh and I also ask every
[26:02] guest of mine uh um what topics you want
[26:04] to speak about I think one of I think
[26:07] the first what actually you wrote back
[26:08] to me was time uh which is also
[26:10] fascinating um how has Bitcoin changed
[26:13] your perception or your meaning of of of
[26:16] time I'm not sure that Bitcoin has
[26:18] changed a lot for me when it comes to
[26:21] time well it it has it has lowered my
[26:24] time preference uh but that sort of
[26:26] feels trivial after a few years but I
[26:28] guess it's not like if you talk to Nory
[26:30] uh with high time preference so I mean
[26:34] that it's it's just an a personal
[26:36] transformation that we should all
[26:38] undergo we go back to what is inherently
[26:41] true about ourselves and as a as human
[26:44] beings we have a a natural shorttime
[26:48] preference um we have a long time
[26:50] Horizon we look deep into the future if
[26:52] we are permitted to but the Fiat system
[26:55] disallows it so Bitcoin is just going
[26:59] back to normal it allows us again to
[27:01] think about the future and plan for the
[27:02] future but I think what what changes um
[27:06] there are a lot of things that have
[27:07] changed for me recently like with
[27:10] regards to how I look at reality and
[27:13] time um I'm not sure in what end to
[27:17] start here because I think we could we
[27:19] could go down a rabbit hole of time and
[27:24] quantum mechanics possibly let's do it
[27:27] should we do it yeah I hav like I don't
[27:29] know what uh quanton mechanics and and
[27:32] time have have together so like I I
[27:34] definitely learned something new all
[27:36] right uh uh oh actually I'm here let me
[27:39] show you I'm reading this book right now
[27:41] something deeply hidden by physicist
[27:43] Sean Carol it's a a fascinating read
[27:46] it's a fascinating read it's a bit mathy
[27:49] and there's a lot of physics in it but
[27:51] if you can stomach that it's um it said
[27:55] something quite profound about our
[27:59] reality so this is something that has
[28:02] like fundamentally changed how we look
[28:04] at reality and this is really
[28:05] fascinating so there are essentially two
[28:08] interpretations of quantum mechanics How
[28:10] the Universe How the Universe works at a
[28:12] fundamental level there are two schools
[28:14] of thought there's the Copenhagen
[28:16] interpretation of quantum mechanics and
[28:19] then there then there's the many worlds
[28:22] interpretation and they're both equally
[28:24] fascinating and they're both equally
[28:26] terrifying both of these realities shake
[28:29] me to my core and I'm not being dramatic
[28:31] here well I am but if you contemplate
[28:34] deeply the implications of these two
[28:36] realities it changes your relationship
[28:39] with the reality because it changes the
[28:41] nature of reality and what can be more
[28:44] fascinating and terrifying so to
[28:46] understand these ideas these two
[28:48] realities that we these two theories
[28:50] about reality you have to know just very
[28:53] superficially what quantum mechanics is
[28:55] and what is meant by the term
[28:57] superposition and this is not
[28:59] complicated at all I mean it's the most
[29:00] complicated thing in the world but uh
[29:02] just the definitions are not that hard
[29:04] to grasp so quantum mechanics is just a
[29:08] branch of physics and it is our best
[29:10] understanding of the universe and it's
[29:12] not it's not an approximation of the
[29:15] universe it it is the universe and what
[29:18] is meant by the term uh superposition
[29:21] well sorry let me go back uh quantum
[29:23] mechanics uh what it does what it says
[29:26] is that um it describes particles and
[29:30] events as existing in
[29:33] superpositions and uh behaving
[29:36] probabilistically and superposition
[29:38] means that something is in in uh two
[29:41] states or two places at the same time
[29:44] which is very very counterintuitive to
[29:46] us human beings but the universe is no
[29:51] obligation to make sense to us so the
[29:54] cat can be dead and alive at the same
[29:56] time actually it is
[29:58] uh it's both both things at once it's
[30:01] just this is just very counterintuitive
[30:03] to um the quantum universe is very
[30:06] counterintuitive to the human brain but
[30:08] it is what it is and this has
[30:10] implications for reality so first the
[30:14] Copenhagen interpretation says that some
[30:16] says something truly fascinating about
[30:19] quantum mechanics it says this uh
[30:22] quantum mechanics says that the Universe
[30:25] exists in a superposition of possible
[30:27] state another way to say this is this is
[30:30] that the universe is a wave
[30:32] function wave functions describe the
[30:35] probability of where a particle might be
[30:38] or what state it might be in at any
[30:40] given
[30:41] time okay so but when we make an
[30:45] observation of that particle that's in a
[30:47] superp position like every particle
[30:50] always is a particle is in a superp
[30:52] position until it is observed because
[30:54] when we observe it we collapse the wave
[30:56] function me meaning we force it to be in
[31:00] a determined State and it's no longer in
[31:03] this mystical two states at once Quantum
[31:06] state in other words by looking at the
[31:09] particle we force the universe to make a
[31:12] decision to be in one of the two states
[31:14] and here's the fascinating part the
[31:17] entire universe is a Quantum system it's
[31:20] one wave
[31:22] function and the wave function of the
[31:25] universe uh exists in a superp I of
[31:28] possible
[31:29] States so take an electron an electron
[31:32] can be spin up or spin down along a
[31:35] vertical
[31:36] axis but when observed the two possibil
[31:40] it is uh both spin up and spin down i s
[31:44] should say it's in a super position
[31:46] until it is observed but the two
[31:48] possibilities of spin up and spin down
[31:50] collapse into one outcome either spin up
[31:52] or spin down when we observe it and this
[31:54] means that the universe
[31:58] this means that the universe so it means
[32:01] that the universe is created as we
[32:04] observe it the implications of the
[32:06] Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
[32:07] mechanics is that you are creating
[32:10] reality as you go simply by observing
[32:13] and being conscious of it because that
[32:15] is how you collapse the superposition of
[32:17] the wave function function of the
[32:20] universe and this gives me goosebumps
[32:22] this means that reality doesn't really
[32:24] fully exist in a definite State until it
[32:29] is observed before any observation is
[32:31] made particles and the entire universe
[32:34] are in a superposition of all possible
[32:36] outcomes and we only force it into a
[32:39] definitive State the moment we observe
[32:42] it so our Consciousness creates Reality
[32:46] by being conscious of reality that is
[32:48] the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum
[32:50] mechanics and it's fascinating and if
[32:52] you think that the Copenhagen
[32:54] interpretation of quantum mechanics is
[32:55] fascinating wait until you hear the many
[32:58] worlds interpretation and Sean Carroll
[33:01] in something deeply hidden this book he
[33:04] um is a proponent of the Min worlds
[33:06] Theory and this is even more fascinating
[33:09] and terrifying on the Copenhagen side we
[33:11] have that we create reality as we go
[33:14] along by collapsing the the
[33:17] superposition of the universe's wave
[33:19] function and it's my understanding that
[33:22] that sounds like the more that actually
[33:25] sounds like the more sober um
[33:27] interpretation of quantum mechanics but
[33:30] more physicists I believe are actually
[33:32] leaning towards the many world's
[33:34] interpretation and I'm no
[33:36] physicist but I can be scared by physics
[33:40] just the same and I lean towards the
[33:43] many worlds interpretation as well so
[33:45] the Min words interpretation says that
[33:47] instead of collapsing into one reality
[33:50] uh when we observe something all
[33:55] possible outcomes actually happen
[33:57] meaning that the Universe splits into
[34:00] different branches one for each outcome
[34:04] so you flip a coin and in one branch of
[34:07] the universe it lands
[34:09] heads and uh and you decide to ask the
[34:12] girl out in this version of reality you
[34:14] get to be happy in another branch of the
[34:17] universe the coin lands tales and you
[34:19] decide to stay at home and uh you have a
[34:23] comfortable evening on your couch
[34:25] watching Netflix here's the disturbing
[34:27] part
[34:28] these two branches they both exist
[34:33] physically they don't interact they
[34:35] can't interact uh but they're equally
[34:38] real and they exist in parallel
[34:41] universes and parallel here is a is a
[34:44] very it's a challenging concept for the
[34:47] human brain to
[34:48] grasp but in the um many world's
[34:52] interpretation of quantum mechanics
[34:53] there's no need to collapse the wave
[34:55] function there's a lot of criticism
[34:57] against the Copenhagen interpretation
[34:59] because like what is an observer really
[35:01] um Can can a machine be an observer does
[35:03] it have to be conscious what is an
[35:05] observer something has to observe the
[35:07] wave function for it to collapse we know
[35:09] that but what is an observer but the
[35:12] entire universe is quantum it's not just
[35:14] an approximation of the universe like
[35:17] classical physics but the quantum
[35:20] mechanics actually is what the universe
[35:23] is and the universe remains in a super
[35:27] position of all possible outcomes at all
[35:30] time each Quantum event like a coin toss
[35:33] like you make a coin toss it can land
[35:35] heads or tails when you make that coin
[35:37] toss it causes the universe to
[35:39] Branch with both possible outcomes
[35:42] happening in its own version of reality
[35:45] uh there's going to be one where it
[35:47] lands tails and another one where it
[35:49] lands heads both
[35:52] are equally real so instead of us people
[35:57] collap cing the universe into a single
[35:59] outcome by observing it as in accordance
[36:02] to the Copenhagen interpretation of
[36:03] quantum mechanics the universe splits
[36:06] into different branches where different
[36:09] versions of you exist in those different
[36:11] realities uh and these other versions
[36:15] versions are inaccessible they are
[36:18] parallel they are simultaneous they are
[36:22] uh inaccessible they are they're as real
[36:24] as reality you
[36:26] experience but they are they're not it's
[36:29] not like they are this means that there
[36:31] are two possibilities we have the
[36:33] Copenhagen and we have the many worlds
[36:36] either we create the universe by
[36:38] observing and experiencing it or the
[36:41] universe splits into several branches
[36:44] branches Moment by moment where those
[36:47] other worlds are equally real but they
[36:49] don't like exist in space somewhere uh
[36:53] but they exist in parallel to our own
[36:55] reality in an in accessible Quantum
[36:58] reality and this has fundamentally
[37:01] changed how I look at reality and I
[37:02] think that the cognitive Horizon of
[37:04] human beings is challenged by quantum
[37:05] mechanics and and I'm not sure we will
[37:08] ever be able to understand uh it more
[37:11] than
[37:12] mathematically we either don't have the
[37:14] hardware or the software or both to
[37:16] grasp the nature of reality intuitively
[37:19] and I I just think that this is um it's
[37:21] fascinating and terrifying that these
[37:24] two these are the two best interpret
[37:27] ations of reality as we know them it
[37:30] looks like either we create reality as
[37:33] we go along or there are infinite
[37:37] numbers um versions equally real
[37:40] someplace parallel that they are
[37:42] inaccessible to us if you watch or
[37:45] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[37:47] I'll guess you already bought some
[37:49] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[37:52] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[37:55] in a hardware wallet my personal
[37:57] recommendation for harder wallet is the
[37:59] bit box it's super secure it's simple to
[38:02] set up it's also perfect gift for a
[38:04] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[38:07] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[38:10] with the code Robin at the checkout
[38:12] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[38:17] your bitbox and the next step is to
[38:19] really level up your sovereignty as an
[38:21] individual you have to have the most
[38:24] secure self custody setup you have to
[38:26] secure your own devices you have to
[38:29] protect your privacy you have to set up
[38:32] an inheritance plan and depending on
[38:34] where you live you even want to have a
[38:37] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[38:40] in case something goes really really
[38:42] wrong and through all those steps the
[38:43] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[38:47] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[38:49] way.com
[38:50] Partners SL robobin you even get a 30
[38:53] minute free call to find out how you can
[38:56] level up your sovereignty and last but
[38:59] not least I have something completely
[39:01] new for you guys I partnered up with
[39:05] coin vigilante this is the most
[39:07] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[39:10] saw created by anyone look at that
[39:13] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[39:16] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[39:19] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[39:22] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[39:25] and that watch brand is Bitcoin coin
[39:27] only make sure to check out the link in
[39:30] the description for those amazing coin
[39:32] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[39:35] amazing I love them so much it was
[39:37] really hard for me to pick the one that
[39:39] I want to have because there are a lot
[39:41] of great options I went with the new
[39:43] transparency Edition they're all limited
[39:47] so grab yours those will not be
[39:49] available for a long time but there will
[39:51] come new models and new amazing designs
[39:54] along the way that is that is
[39:56] fascinating and I I I actually never
[39:58] looked looked into that I I heard the
[40:03] the words uh already before um in in
[40:08] series and movies and stuff like that uh
[40:10] but I never really looked into quantum
[40:11] mechanics like that it's it's
[40:13] fascinating to uh to understand that now
[40:16] a little bit we all just want deeper
[40:17] experiences right and there there are
[40:21] many ways to have deep experiences uh I
[40:24] I think that understanding reality is is
[40:27] one of the best ways to experience it
[40:30] more deeply if you and the best way to
[40:33] get to like
[40:36] um like a more fundamental like an um a
[40:41] deeper understanding of the fundamental
[40:43] nature of reality you first of all need
[40:46] to observe it which you can do through
[40:48] meditation and you can have a have some
[40:52] help with psychedelics here but to also
[40:54] understand it physically and mathematic
[40:56] mathematically
[40:57] um even if you don't understand the math
[41:00] if you don't speak that language I don't
[41:01] speak math Beyond like high school or
[41:04] some basic University math uh I don't
[41:07] speak math like the physicists do but
[41:10] you can still understand the
[41:12] implications of their of their work by
[41:15] analogy that can lead to some I think
[41:18] for me that is the best way to have a
[41:20] deeper experience of
[41:22] reality I've been spending a lot of time
[41:24] in nature uh lately
[41:28] I'm in love with it I'm mesmerized by it
[41:31] I love the
[41:32] beauty and I love the technology of
[41:36] nature I think nature is a great place
[41:38] to have some of the deep deeper
[41:41] experiences
[41:43] and I've been
[41:46] contemplating like how human how
[41:49] arrogant we human beings can be
[41:51] sometimes like we how we think that we
[41:53] are so technologically Superior to
[41:55] anything else that has existed beside
[41:58] besides us but if we compare Nature's
[42:00] technology to our own technology if we
[42:03] were to make that distinction it's it
[42:05] can be argued that you can't really make
[42:06] that distinction because the technology
[42:09] we create is nature as well but like if
[42:11] we make that distinction for argument
[42:14] sake that there's technology that nature
[42:16] has created and there's technology that
[42:18] we have created we are lagging
[42:21] behind the technology created by Man by
[42:23] no means compete with the technology of
[42:26] nature
[42:28] we are nowhere near the sophistication
[42:30] of Nature and thinking otherwise would
[42:33] only prove our arrogance as as human
[42:35] beings here here here's um okay so a few
[42:38] examples like here's what nature can do
[42:41] nature builds
[42:45] self-replicating uh we have never built
[42:48] anything that's
[42:49] self-replicating but nature buil
[42:51] self-replicating conscious machines that
[42:54] last for hundreds of years in in human
[42:57] beings Nature has created us and I think
[43:00] we are nature's magnum
[43:03] opus uh so that's where where I'll start
[43:05] flexing on Nature's behalf uh it created
[43:09] humans so everything that humans create
[43:12] basically also created nature because
[43:15] nature created humans yeah exactly and
[43:17] that's the distinction I want to make um
[43:19] that's what I said that that I want if
[43:21] for argument sake we can just uh if we
[43:24] want to Marvel at Nature's technology I
[43:26] think it can be benef beneficial to
[43:27] compare it to human technology because
[43:29] we we have an intuitive grasp for our
[43:31] own technology but we we don't really
[43:33] appreciate how sophisticated Nature's
[43:36] technology truly is but nature can
[43:39] actually create self-replicating
[43:40] conscious
[43:42] machines we can't create anything that's
[43:44] self-replicating let alone conscious but
[43:46] nature has other cool take as well like
[43:49] take biological memory for example
[43:52] nature doesn't use papirus or hard
[43:55] drives to erve information it uses DNA
[43:59] and DNA lasts for
[44:02] eons DNA has preserved information like
[44:05] like the the blueprint for iron channels
[44:09] for billions of years so we have
[44:13] nothing that comes close to preserving
[44:19] information over any time that even
[44:23] compares to what nature can do like the
[44:25] best we have done is to to build things
[44:28] out of stone and to carve things into
[44:30] stone but that deteriorates over
[44:33] thousands to um a couple of million
[44:37] years we have actually now um found a
[44:41] way to preserve
[44:43] information over longer periods of time
[44:46] for example we have sent the Voyager
[44:49] craft into deep
[44:51] space and that craft those craft contain
[44:56] the gold record with photos music and a
[44:59] a small library of human knowledge and
[45:02] we sent that in out into the cosmos kind
[45:04] of like a monument to humanity or a
[45:06] tombstone if you want a darker look at
[45:10] it
[45:11] um and that those spacecraft Voyager One
[45:15] and Voyager 2 sent out in in 1973 I
[45:18] think
[45:20] they they are going to sail the cosmic
[45:23] oceans for billions of years intact so
[45:27] now we actually found a way to preserve
[45:29] information over long periods of time
[45:31] but like it's not as dynamic as DNA and
[45:34] nature has other uh has more cool
[45:36] Technologies like um a third extremely
[45:39] cool technology that that nature
[45:43] has that we can't compete with by any
[45:46] stretch of the imagination is uh
[45:49] photosynthesis and you know what makes
[45:50] uh photosynthesis so cool like are you
[45:53] familiar with the
[45:54] concept yeah I mean uh the from from the
[45:57] Sun you get get the energy and and then
[46:00] it it grows that's basically what what I
[46:02] know about it absolutely it's it's what
[46:04] has brought life to this planet
[46:06] essentially and what makes it so cool is
[46:09] that it's a quantum mechanical
[46:11] computation at room temperature let me
[46:15] explain like we have no idea what
[46:18] photosynthesis is or like how it works
[46:21] we can observe the molecules and we can
[46:23] see what they do but how they actually
[46:25] do what they do is far beyond the grasp
[46:28] of any
[46:29] human so uh like if you look at
[46:34] photosynthesis like take a plant there's
[46:36] this light harvesting molecule in the
[46:39] plant uh it absorbs sunlight and that
[46:43] absorbed energy here this is in a super
[46:48] position so that energy
[46:51] uh the light harvesting complex absorbs
[46:54] the energy of light and that energy is
[46:57] in a super
[46:58] position which means that it is
[47:02] exploring uh it is in a super position
[47:05] uh in the sense that it explores
[47:07] multiple paths
[47:10] simultaneously uh allowing the plant to
[47:13] find the most efficient route for that
[47:15] stored energy to the reaction Center
[47:19] without losing energy essentially
[47:22] performing a Quantum computation to
[47:24] optimize the energy transfer from from
[47:26] the light harvesting complex to the
[47:30] center of the where where the energy is
[47:32] going to be used uh it explores multiple
[47:36] paths at once that is a Quantum
[47:39] computation and it does this at room
[47:42] temperature that is the most fascinating
[47:44] thing um because remember for us humans
[47:48] to do even simple calculations with a
[47:50] quantum computer we need to keep it at
[47:52] around-
[47:54] 27313 5° C
[47:57] which is around 2.7
[48:00] Kelvin uh and the reason we need to keep
[48:02] it so cold is to prevent something
[48:03] called
[48:05] decoherence uh decoherence is when uh
[48:09] cubits lose their Quantum properties and
[48:12] start acting like a regular object
[48:14] cubits are the bits of the quantum
[48:17] computers like Trad traditional
[48:19] computers are made of transition
[48:21] transistors which can be either on or
[48:23] off one or zero one is a bit zero is a
[48:26] bit so regular computers works with bits
[48:29] uh but in quantum computers um the bit
[48:31] is a cubit so instead of being just one
[48:34] or zero it can be both at once it's in a
[48:38] super position it's both zero and and
[48:41] one at the same time and every number in
[48:43] between at the same time it's all the
[48:45] numbers at the same time uh it's the
[48:48] superp position has not collapsed into a
[48:50] z or one it's it's not classical physics
[48:53] it's quantum physics so and I mean the
[48:55] superposition is not very intuitive to
[48:57] the human brain so so as I say this I'm
[48:59] it's kind of like I'm trying to explain
[49:01] it to myself I I my cognitive Horizon is
[49:04] limited here I can't I can't grasp what
[49:07] it means um what superposition actually
[49:09] means I tried EXT extensively to Grapple
[49:12] with this Con concept but I'm but I'm a
[49:15] monkey so I can't that's that's so
[49:18] fascinating to hear that there are like
[49:20] several realities or we create reality
[49:23] when when we observe things um which is
[49:26] also Al interesting to think if the many
[49:29] world theories is is right then there
[49:31] are like many many Bitcoin blockchains
[49:33] like there maybe even like reality
[49:36] worlds without Bitcoin uh I actually
[49:39] made made a video about this uh or did I
[49:41] make it I'm not sure I have a script at
[49:43] least I'm not sure if I made a video
[49:44] about it yet like just the idea that uh
[49:48] that just a fun philosophical idea that
[49:51] Bitcoin may actually be like a breaking
[49:53] Quantum reality because it it is the one
[49:56] on Truth through time uh that doesn't
[50:02] branch uh which uh which is just a fun
[50:04] thought experiment um it's not it's not
[50:07] true but it it helps it gains some
[50:09] perspective on reality and on
[50:11] bitcoin I just wanted to finish the
[50:13] point with with quantum computers here
[50:15] um just let me drive on the point uh
[50:17] real quick like so to maintain this uh
[50:20] superp position in our quantum computers
[50:23] the cubits must be extremely cold to
[50:25] prevent anything
[50:27] uh in their surroundings to move at all
[50:29] everything needs to be frozen completely
[50:32] still because otherwise the cubits begin
[50:34] to to interact with their surroundings
[50:37] like um atoms and particles moving
[50:40] around due to the heat so we need to
[50:42] freeze every particle every atom into
[50:44] place for our cubits to
[50:46] work uh so but nature doesn't need to do
[50:51] that by the way I can kind of like
[50:54] identify with these cubits because uh
[50:57] like on a personal lever they they seem
[50:59] very autistic and like they have adht at
[51:01] the same time they need to be they need
[51:04] to be uh in a very calm and quiet place
[51:07] and they're very easily distracted
[51:08] nature uh has found this way to make
[51:13] Quantum uh
[51:15] calculations at room temperature without
[51:18] freezing all the molecules at the same
[51:21] time or like while it's making these
[51:25] calculations and that's what I mean when
[51:27] I say that no human being understands
[51:29] what photosynthesis actually is or how
[51:31] it
[51:31] works um because nature does Quantum
[51:35] calculations at Ro room temperatures and
[51:38] we are nowhere near that at all that
[51:40] that's really really fascinating a lot
[51:42] of new things for me here to to process
[51:46] I will I will have to rewatch that
[51:47] episode myself a lot yeah is this a
[51:50] Bitcoin episode I'm not
[51:52] sure maybe maybe not that's a
[51:55] fascinating thing um I have a Bitcoin
[51:57] podcast this one here and I talk
[52:00] everyone every day about Bitcoin but
[52:03] Bitcoin has bring so many different
[52:05] interesting topics uh uh to the show
[52:08] where I think I only talk around 40%
[52:12] actually about Bitcoin so I think most
[52:16] of the show is actually already about
[52:18] something else that touches on bitcoin
[52:21] because Bitcoin seemingly touches
[52:23] everything uh but yeah I mean I mean my
[52:27] favorite example for that is always I
[52:29] made with Lisa Huff um a whole episode
[52:32] around parenting like we we didn't I
[52:35] think we maybe talked about like we
[52:37] maybe mentioned the word Bitcoin like
[52:39] four times uh I was making an episode
[52:44] with Michael S it was like one and a
[52:45] half hours long and just for fun I was
[52:47] searching in my transcript for Bitcoin
[52:50] and it was 205 times in there like we we
[52:53] mentioned Bitcoin so many times it's
[52:55] fascinating so if Bitcoin only comes
[52:57] like three times in an episode that's a
[52:59] really low number uh just just to give a
[53:02] perspective so it's interesting how you
[53:05] can have a Bitcoin podcast and you talk
[53:07] about so many different topics imagine
[53:09] doing the same thing when you have like
[53:12] a stock podcast or something like that
[53:14] you you you you rather stick to your
[53:16] topic but with Bitcoin yeah it doesn't
[53:18] translate yeah with Bitcoin you can talk
[53:20] about everything also the audience loves
[53:22] it I think the audience would be bored
[53:25] of after some time is if the only topic
[53:28] would be actually Bitcoin it's a Bitcoin
[53:31] podcast but uh it's it's it's good that
[53:33] we touch on different topics and then
[53:36] it's also always interesting how those
[53:38] different topics kind of coexists with
[53:41] with with Bitcoin for example with the
[53:43] quantum mechanics where uh we have the
[53:45] blockchain that all of a sudden gives
[53:47] that truth to to those different
[53:49] realities where it's like how does how
[53:52] does that uh translate or you said like
[53:56] we we cannot make ourselves Immortal uh
[53:59] and then with Bitcoin you can transcribe
[54:01] uh inscribe your your name uh you you
[54:04] can describe transactions and make
[54:06] yourself kind of immortal in the in the
[54:09] Bitcoin blockchain that's that's quite
[54:12] it's quite a fascinating idea to I think
[54:14] you made a video even about it if yeah
[54:16] yeah it's one of my more recent videos
[54:19] yeah yeah I think I think seen it yeah
[54:21] yeah yeah I'm um I'm on this I have this
[54:25] project now like I've had this YouTube
[54:27] channel for for years but I've never
[54:29] really made anything of it so now I
[54:32] decided to
[54:33] just publish one video a week uh and
[54:37] giving myself a hard deadline and it's
[54:39] super difficult to make these videos in
[54:41] in in just a week juggling like all the
[54:44] other stuff I have at least so but so
[54:47] far I'm on week eight now and I'm on
[54:52] schedule to publish a new one um
[54:55] tomorrow
[54:57] uh and this one is going to be about
[55:01] well again a bit about human history but
[55:03] it's a very very fascinating concept
[55:06] like how all of recorded human history
[55:10] uh fits into just 50 generations and
[55:13] like the implications of this uh it's um
[55:16] I
[55:17] was sitting here editing just as we
[55:21] started
[55:22] recording and
[55:24] uh I'm
[55:26] it's also going to touch a bit on on
[55:28] psychedelics because psychedelics have
[55:30] been so transformative to uh to our
[55:34] Evolution our development of language
[55:37] and um just how how we think and what we
[55:40] think about uh psychedelics have really
[55:43] expanded our cognitive Horizons in ways
[55:46] that few other things have like the the
[55:49] things that have expanded our uh
[55:51] cognition to even a
[55:54] similar degree would be like having more
[55:58] calories and starting to use tools and
[56:01] language so calories tools language and
[56:04] psychedelics are probably the main
[56:06] drivers for our for the for the
[56:09] expansion of the human mind you
[56:11] mentioned I think in in a podcast or a
[56:13] video that you see Bitcoin as an
[56:15] economic psych psychedelic I have a hard
[56:18] time always yeah it is it it is an
[56:21] economic psychedelic yeah how do you
[56:23] mean that what are the implications of
[56:25] that I'm actually covering this in the
[56:27] video now that you mention it that's F
[56:29] that's interesting uncanny timing
[56:30] Bitcoin is it's not just an economic
[56:32] psychedelic it's a psychedelic period
[56:35] not a chemical one but it's a
[56:37] psychedelic in in a variety of ways but
[56:40] it has very psychedelic uh implications
[56:43] for the
[56:44] economy so one ways in one way that
[56:47] Bitcoin is a psychedelic is that
[56:49] psychedelic means mind
[56:51] manifesting so it shows what what exists
[56:55] within so second delics give you um an
[56:58] inventory of your mental algorithms they
[57:01] show you who you are truly you cannot
[57:05] close your eyes to the facts about who
[57:07] you are um in a psychedelic State they
[57:11] show you all the garbage that you carry
[57:12] within H they show all the flaws that
[57:15] you carry and but they also show you
[57:17] everything that's beautiful
[57:19] Bitcoin holds up a mirror to the economy
[57:22] and
[57:23] says this is all the trash that you have
[57:25] in the economy
[57:27] uh there
[57:29] is you have all these kinds of weird
[57:32] economic algorithms that have become
[57:35] truths because they've just existed for
[57:38] so long like we tell it TR we we tell
[57:41] stories about ourselves and that's what
[57:42] we become but they are not we tell
[57:45] stories about ourselves and those
[57:47] stories we become those stories but
[57:50] they're not necessarily true and the
[57:51] psychedelics can show us that these
[57:54] stories that we tell ourselves are not
[57:55] true like uh if if you tell yourself
[57:58] that I can never I could never run a
[58:00] marathon or I could never lose weight or
[58:03] I can never find a partner or I could
[58:05] never write a book these things become
[58:08] who you are all of the stories that you
[58:10] have about yourself they become who you
[58:12] are psychedelics show you that these are
[58:14] just stories and that you have the
[58:17] ability to to reprogram your mind and
[58:19] change the by changing these
[58:22] stories uh like the difference between a
[58:24] smoker and a non-smoker and someone
[58:27] who's trying to quit is that the the
[58:29] person who actually quits begins to they
[58:33] have changed their story they're are no
[58:35] longer a smoker so you can there can be
[58:38] a person who has not smoked for 16
[58:41] months or sorry this is 16 weird number
[58:44] six months and
[58:47] uh and still be thinking of themselves
[58:50] as someone who is quitting
[58:54] smoking and then there can be someone
[58:57] who has just hasn't smoked for a day but
[59:02] they have made the
[59:04] fundamental uh understanding or um
[59:08] change within themselves that they are
[59:10] no longer a smoker one of those two
[59:12] people is going to stay off cigarettes
[59:14] the other one is not and it's the one
[59:17] that has changed the story about who
[59:19] they are and so psychedelics show us all
[59:22] these stories that we carry within and
[59:24] gives us the plasticity to actually
[59:26] change
[59:27] our our mental algorithms because if
[59:30] they just showed them to us it would be
[59:33] kind of pointless we also need the
[59:34] plasticity to actually make the change
[59:37] and psychedelics provide that plasticity
[59:39] into the brain the the Psychedelic state
[59:42] is a hyper plastic hyperconnected State
[59:46] it's very very highly entropic it's a
[59:49] high entropy State the Psychedelic State
[59:53] Bitcoin and in the same sense that Psych
[59:56] Del expose the flaws that you have
[59:58] within you in your mind in your
[59:59] cognitive algorithms Bitcoin shows the
[60:02] economic algorithms within the Fiat
[60:03] system that are just garbage like for
[60:06] example the idea that we need a state to
[60:11] issue money or control money or mandate
[60:14] inflation these are stories that we've
[60:16] been telling ourselves and they have
[60:18] become economic reality because we have
[60:20] told them so many times but it's not
[60:23] true um it's not true and Bitcoin shows
[60:25] us that it's not true and it provides
[60:29] the pl plasticity in the economy for us
[60:32] to actually change this by providing
[60:35] good money by providing a new economic
[60:37] operating system it shows us that that
[60:40] money shouldn't be a use for a tool for
[60:44] financial
[60:45] surveillance it does this by being money
[60:48] that um that if implemented correctly
[60:51] cannot be used to spy on you it um shows
[60:54] us that having weak money
[60:56] makes us weak because it undermines our
[61:01] potential to coordinate and collaborate
[61:05] to the best of our
[61:07] abilities and that that limits the
[61:10] amount of complexity that we can have in
[61:12] society Bitcoin shows us all these
[61:14] things and provides the plasticity
[61:16] plasticity into the economy for us to
[61:19] actually uh make the changes so that
[61:21] that's in one way that Bitcoin is an
[61:23] economic psychedelic it gives us these
[61:25] Grand realizations of what's actually
[61:27] going on and then giving us the the
[61:30] space and the plasticity to actually
[61:32] make the
[61:33] change so uh that's that's one crucial
[61:38] way that Bitcoin is uh is an economic
[61:41] psychedelic and it's it's a psychedelic
[61:43] period um in many other ways because it
[61:46] does the same thing to the economy as it
[61:49] does to you like other psychedelics do
[61:51] it exposes it exposes what you have
[61:54] within you it Expos what kind of time
[61:56] preference you have it exposes what kind
[61:59] of priorities you make and it it gives
[62:03] you the environment the plasticity if
[62:07] you will again to actually make a change
[62:11] there as well so now you have the
[62:13] ability to think about the future and
[62:15] save for the future before maybe you
[62:17] couldn't like if you go to Argentina or
[62:21] um a place like that like they can't
[62:24] save for the future the there's just no
[62:26] they don't have the ability to sa for
[62:28] the future and if you look it in uh to
[62:31] El Salvador before uh it was Bitcoin
[62:35] IED like everything was very fleeting
[62:38] money was fleeting life was fleeting so
[62:41] people spent just everything as quickly
[62:45] as they could there was
[62:47] no people when you have this broken
[62:51] money that just evaporates as soon as
[62:53] you touches it there's no no reason to
[62:56] save it you can't save it there's no
[62:57] meaning to it so that means that you
[63:00] spend it right now you spend it as
[63:02] quickly as
[63:03] possible and you don't use it to build a
[63:06] future if you look back 2,000 years when
[63:09] we had hard money when we had the
[63:11] Denarius when we used the gold and
[63:13] silver money we see their we see it in
[63:15] their architecture we see it in their
[63:17] plays we see it in their writing we see
[63:20] it in their uh political systems we see
[63:24] it in how money really is a a mental
[63:28] operating system that governs our time
[63:31] preference and time preference is
[63:32] everything time preference isn't just
[63:34] about uh should I eat ice cream today or
[63:37] not it it's about should we become a
[63:39] space fairing civilization a
[63:40] multiplanetary space fairing
[63:42] civilization and and create longevity
[63:45] escape
[63:46] velocity um type of a civilization those
[63:49] kinds of decisions are at stake because
[63:52] when we are in a when we're entrenched
[63:54] in a Fiat system where money erodes we
[63:58] are not at we cannot coordinate to the
[64:01] extent that we need and because we're
[64:04] just we spend the money as soon as as we
[64:06] get it we are not building for the
[64:08] future and the money doesn't qualify it
[64:13] doesn't have the ability to create a
[64:16] complex coordination across time and
[64:19] space which is needed if you want to
[64:22] have complexity in society and for us to
[64:25] continue to evolve and become uh space
[64:29] fairing multiplanetary species we're not
[64:32] going to do that under a Fiat system but
[64:35] we but we will under a Bitcoin
[64:37] system that's a beautiful realization I
[64:40] I think we we kind of went really
[64:43] quickly to the end of the end of this
[64:45] podcast it flew away the time um but I
[64:48] think that's a it's a really beautiful
[64:50] end uh um to to end it with um I have
[64:54] two end rtin
[64:56] in the podcast where the first question
[64:57] is always the same question for each
[64:59] guest and I usually ask what can we
[65:01] learn from you besides Bitcoin but I
[65:03] will ask you uh what can we learn from
[65:06] you besides all the things that we
[65:08] already talked about in this podcast I
[65:10] like to do a lot of things I'm not sure
[65:11] that I the greatest teacher of
[65:14] anything but what I'm very good at I'm
[65:16] very good at having good
[65:18] experiences and living life like there
[65:21] there are some experiences that are
[65:24] truly truly expansive
[65:27] and like unfathomable and I like to go
[65:30] into these
[65:31] places and I think I'm pretty good at
[65:34] helping people get there as well to have
[65:37] deeper
[65:39] experiences I there are so many people
[65:41] who have
[65:43] anxiety
[65:44] who go through life having some
[65:48] resistance to what is have resistance to
[65:51] life what we need to do is just quiet
[65:53] the mind and open open our hearts quiet
[65:55] the the mind and open the heart how do
[65:57] we quiet the mind we meditate how do we
[66:00] open our hearts we just find an ember of
[66:05] love and focus on that thing and feel
[66:08] that love intensely whether it's for
[66:11] just for your breath for being alive for
[66:16] a sibling for a parent for a child for a
[66:19] pet find some kind of Ember
[66:23] and and feel that love intensely and
[66:27] then let it expand and when you get good
[66:29] at expanding the feeling of Love um you
[66:32] can expand it to Encompass the entire
[66:36] universe and
[66:37] you love everything about The Human
[66:40] Experience the good and the bad the
[66:43] whole
[66:44] spectrum and that is the only way to
[66:46] live life this is something that I want
[66:48] to this is a journey um like my
[66:51] spiritual journey is the most important
[66:53] thing to me in my life
[66:55] and I want to bring as many people along
[66:58] as possible to a more awakened state so
[67:03] that is something that is very important
[67:04] to me right now and that is something uh
[67:06] that I think that I have to offer other
[67:08] people beautiful I like it a lot uh I
[67:11] think
[67:12] it's could be hard to to offer it to
[67:15] other people but but probably it's
[67:18] possible I like the f a lot they're
[67:20] really cool um the other in of the
[67:22] podcast is where the previous guest is
[67:25] asking question for the next guest oh
[67:27] without knowing who the next guest
[67:29] actually is uh and the previous guest
[67:31] asked you the question is it important
[67:35] uh to separate Bitcoin from political
[67:38] views if so why or why not especially in
[67:43] election year kind of
[67:46] relevant well that's a good question and
[67:49] a super cool thing that you do in your
[67:51] podcast I like that that's cool cool
[67:53] that you have that um
[67:56] so
[67:57] uh two thoughts here first uh bcoin
[68:01] hunted Badger doesn't care doesn't
[68:03] matter it really doesn't it really
[68:06] doesn't but
[68:08] uh then that's uh that's the short and
[68:11] true answer like the whole thing with
[68:13] having uh Party politics is is not it's
[68:19] um what's the word it's a new phenomenon
[68:21] and it's not always going to be like
[68:22] this we're not always going to have po
[68:25] ICS in the same way that we do
[68:27] now it's a fleeting
[68:30] occurrence and in 400 years it's going
[68:33] to be radically different we're going to
[68:36] we're going to be organizing ourselves
[68:38] in much more sophisticated ways than we
[68:40] are right now like it wasn't that long
[68:43] ago um that we had a feudal system with
[68:46] kings and queens and peasants and stuff
[68:47] we have a better way of organizing
[68:49] ourselves now and this is uh this is by
[68:51] no means the end of the evolution of how
[68:54] humans organize eles but right now it's
[68:56] it's our reality and Bitcoin is going to
[68:59] be on the political agenda it's
[69:04] inevitable and this is my second thought
[69:06] that like we are going to have pass
[69:10] through quite a few stepping stones that
[69:14] are just like ETF inevitable it's it's
[69:16] going to happen it's on the way to
[69:18] bitcoin isation of the economy we cannot
[69:20] Bitcoin IE the economy without going
[69:23] through these steps and hurdles there
[69:25] are going to be battles with the state
[69:28] there there is an ongoing war on
[69:32] privacy perhaps the most important uh
[69:35] war in bitcoin's history makes the block
[69:39] size Wars look like like a snowball
[69:42] fight so there are all of these like
[69:45] inevitable stepping stones that we are
[69:48] going to witness on the road
[69:51] to a hyperbitcoinization
[69:56] uninstall the Fiat system and install
[69:58] the Bitcoin system without
[70:01] some challenges because we can't we
[70:05] can't uninstall the Fiat system and just
[70:07] pass the world and then install Bitcoin
[70:09] it's going to happen in parallel it's a
[70:13] transition and through that transition
[70:16] we will see it become a political issue
[70:19] and I mean it's it's entertaining it's
[70:22] unimportant honey badger doesn't care
[70:25] and it's an in inevitable stepping stone
[70:28] to the
[70:29] Future very true um and I like the two
[70:34] sides of of it uh which also gives the
[70:37] realistic side on of the reality and but
[70:40] still the the vision of Bitcoin really
[70:42] cool and Before I Let You Go um where
