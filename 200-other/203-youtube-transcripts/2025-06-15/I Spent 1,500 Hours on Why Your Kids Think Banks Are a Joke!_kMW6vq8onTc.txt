[00:00] I was at my Thanksgiving Day table with
[00:02] all these college kids, my kids in
[00:04] college. They came home and they all
[00:05] wanted to talk about Bitcoin. This is
[00:06] stuff we wanted people to talk about for
[00:08] generations. Bitcoin made it
[00:10] interesting, made it cool, made it easy
[00:11] to understand. Bitcoin is media, Bitcoin
[00:14] is energy, and Bitcoin is economics.
[00:16] It's a P2P information network. We're
[00:18] able to use each other to filter ideas.
[00:22] And you know what? What AI taught me is
[00:24] that I got news for you. We're not that
[00:26] smart. This whole thing that humans are
[00:28] rational. This is insane. All human
[00:30] decision is made either by fear or
[00:33] desire. American people say, "How are we
[00:35] going to build the roads if you don't
[00:36] have taxes?" Well, in your country, your
[00:38] best roads were built by the gold
[00:40] standard people who had no taxation, who
[00:42] built things that will last forever.
[00:44] What's your excuse? I'll take any
[00:46] degenerate Bitcoiner who figured this
[00:48] stuff out on their own and were able to
[00:49] make a career at 18 than your Harvard
[00:52] degree any day of the week.
[00:56] [Music]
[00:58] Hi Nolan. How you doing? Everything fine
[01:00] on your end? I love my life. Robin, how
[01:02] about you?
[01:04] I think no, nobody ever greeted me like
[01:06] that. I love my life. But but you love
[01:09] your life because of Bitcoin. What are
[01:10] you doing? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. How
[01:12] can we How can you not as a Bitcoiner
[01:14] love your life right now? Things are
[01:16] going great. Who who can complain? It's
[01:18] not possible, right? Kicking ass. We're
[01:20] kicking ass and taking names.
[01:23] What do you mean with uh we're kicking
[01:25] ass in general? Or is there like
[01:27] something specific that makes you
[01:28] bullish? Well, seeing what's happening
[01:30] in America, uh watching America readjust
[01:34] itself to Bitcoin so that Bitcoin fits
[01:37] in America is enough to make any
[01:40] American optimistic. Uh it's it's sort
[01:43] of spreading around the country. It's
[01:45] pushing on borders. Right? There's this
[01:47] idea that you look at the chaos in the
[01:49] world and you you ask is Bitcoin
[01:52] conforming or or finding a place in the
[01:54] chaos. In many ways, Bitcoin is creating
[01:56] the chaos. And you know, you're in
[01:59] you're in Europe and you got the
[02:01] European Central Bank and now you got
[02:02] these trade wars beginning with America.
[02:05] Of course, this is something that could
[02:07] benefit America and Bitcoin. Bitcoin
[02:10] America couldn't do what it's currently
[02:12] doing with Europe and altering these
[02:14] relationships if it wasn't for Bitcoin.
[02:16] if it wasn't for uh a new financial
[02:19] system emerging. So, I think we advanced
[02:22] very quickly with what Michael Sailor's
[02:24] doing with what uh Bitcoin Magazine did
[02:28] with uh getting Trump involved in
[02:30] Bitcoin back in 2024 in the summer and
[02:34] just watching Bitcoin reshape everything
[02:36] through America right now is I think the
[02:40] b the most Bitcoin has always been the
[02:42] most interesting story in finance. that
[02:45] finance part is really spilling over
[02:48] into kinetic relationships between
[02:50] nation states between the configuration
[02:52] of the world. So it's all bullish as far
[02:55] as I'm concerned.
[02:57] How big is it for you that Trump
[03:01] is I I'm I'm cautious with saying he's a
[03:04] Bitcoiner, but let's say with Trump
[03:06] being in Bitcoin, how big is it for me
[03:09] personally? For Yeah, like the it it's
[03:11] an it's it's it was a lonely place, you
[03:15] know, as as you're probably aware, being
[03:17] a Bitcoiner has a certain loneliness
[03:19] factor to it, right? There's once you
[03:22] start groing bitcoin and understanding
[03:24] bitcoin relationships change with before
[03:27] bit it's a sort of before bitcoin you
[03:29] know before Christ type situation you
[03:31] can measure time in it I'm still close
[03:34] with my dear friends that I grew up with
[03:36] but bitcoin creates a type of arangement
[03:39] in some ways once your world view is
[03:41] based on bitcoin and once you start
[03:43] seeing the world with bitcoin eyes um
[03:46] there's a kind of loneliness factor in
[03:47] America that was also true with being a
[03:50] bit uh a Trump supporter back in 2015.
[03:53] I'm I'm an original Bitcoin 2015 long
[03:56] Bitcoin long Trump and that was an very
[04:00] lonely place for many people in America
[04:03] to be that to be one of those people was
[04:06] not easy and for that to change now and
[04:10] that you don't have to you don't have to
[04:13] mix your words you don't have to you can
[04:16] you can add Trump to toxic maximalism.
[04:18] Do you know how much fun that is to be
[04:20] able to trigger liberal people in
[04:22] America with both Trump and Bitcoin at
[04:25] the same time? You know how much
[04:26] excitement this is? It's it's like it's
[04:30] an injection of toxicity into the toxic
[04:33] Bitcoin maximalists that it's like the
[04:36] the the mutant super serum or something.
[04:38] It just it just absolutely turns you
[04:41] into, you know, extra bonus toxic. So
[04:44] that's fun. You also said something
[04:46] interesting. Uh, you said Bitcoin is
[04:48] creating chaos. What do you mean with
[04:51] that? Well, just look at what Trump can
[04:54] do. Look at Canada for example. I'm I'm
[04:56] Canadian as well. And uh in Canada,
[05:00] right, the look at the truckers thing
[05:02] that happened in 2022. When the truckers
[05:05] thing happened, of course, the new prime
[05:07] minister Mark Carney was the governor of
[05:09] the Bank of England, was the governor of
[05:11] the Bank of Canada. I used to work he
[05:12] used to he used to have to report to my
[05:14] committee twice a year to give his
[05:16] economic update. I used to work for the
[05:19] Senate Banking Committee in Canada and
[05:20] so he would come and I know him. I've
[05:22] hung out with him many times. I used to
[05:24] write him to invite in invite him to
[05:26] Bitcoin events regularly. Uh he never
[05:28] came. I actually have fun staying poor
[05:30] at him one time uh when he said no to an
[05:33] event uh because he had a book coming
[05:34] out and I was producing a CoinDesk event
[05:37] in the pandemic and it just so happened
[05:40] that the CoinDesk event was the same day
[05:42] as his book launch values with an S in
[05:46] parenthesis values you know he's such a
[05:48] good person he's so great um and he said
[05:50] oh I can't make it and I said well HFSB
[05:53] have fun you know I don't think he
[05:55] understood what I meant obviously but
[05:57] then he's the guy in Canada that came
[05:58] ahead and told Bitcoiners and and wrote
[06:01] an op-ed in the trucker protest back in
[06:04] 2022 to follow the money. His actual
[06:06] headline was follow the money, stop the
[06:08] protests by using martial law to go
[06:11] after political dissident or or whatever
[06:14] you want to call it to go after
[06:16] political people. And now there was a
[06:19] thought at the time. I did the math when
[06:21] this happened against the Bank of Canada
[06:23] and I said, "Well, what happens? What
[06:24] would what would happen if Bitcoiners
[06:27] globally got together and shorted the
[06:28] Canadian dollar? What would happen?" And
[06:30] I did the math. I found out Canada had
[06:32] about $50 billion in reserves. Exactly
[06:34] what the Bank of England had when George
[06:36] Soros broke their back. And I find out I
[06:39] found out the mechanisms by which George
[06:40] Soros did. It was a $10 billion short on
[06:43] top of their $50
[06:45] billion 50 billion trash token Canadian
[06:48] trash tokens in reserve. And in the case
[06:52] of Bank of England, it took 500 basis
[06:55] points, so a full 5% increase in the um
[07:00] interest rate and all of the reserves
[07:02] were spent. So I said, you know, we
[07:05] could pro the global Bitcoiners who have
[07:07] figured out all this stuff, shorting,
[07:09] forex, everything, we could probably
[07:10] muster a $10 billion short and get a run
[07:12] on the Canadian dollar. Now the problem
[07:14] back then was they would have used their
[07:16] Fed swap line to just reinject the
[07:19] money. So Bitcoin could have taken a
[07:21] punch, could have delivered a punch to
[07:23] the Bank of Canada and the Canadian
[07:24] dollar. The Bank of Canada and the
[07:26] Canadian dollar would have fallen, but
[07:28] the next day the Federal Reserve would
[07:29] have bailed them out. With what's going
[07:31] on now between Trump and Canada and the
[07:34] United States and the trade war, there
[07:36] ain't no Fed Reserve coming to bail out
[07:38] Canada if Bitcoiners decide to take a
[07:40] knock at a pretending trash token and
[07:43] wipe it off the face of the earth. They
[07:45] don't have any gold. They don't have any
[07:47] of this stuff. Canada has been tricked.
[07:50] You know, I I often use you're you're
[07:52] you're an Austrian school guy. Not just
[07:53] an Austrian, but an Austrian school guy.
[07:55] And we of course understand money in
[07:58] psychological terms, right? But it's not
[07:59] it's not about the numbers. There's
[08:00] numbers involved, but math has nothing
[08:02] to do with it. This is not a math game,
[08:04] right? This is a psychological game. And
[08:07] the Canadian psychology has been so
[08:10] mixed with US psychology that it can't
[08:13] tell the difference. But when you
[08:14] actually bring out the money, then it
[08:16] becomes there's a difference. Canada
[08:17] can't behave as if its money is a global
[08:20] reserve currency. And just because it
[08:22] had these advantages of swap lines with
[08:24] the Federal Reserve where they could get
[08:26] free injections of capital, whatever
[08:28] they needed in terms of US dollars to
[08:30] shore up their bank, that's gone. And so
[08:33] if, for example, a bunch of degenerate
[08:36] Bitcoiners want to make money and decide
[08:38] to literally bet against the Bank of
[08:40] Canada, which I think is a good bet,
[08:42] you'll make money and you'll you'll
[08:45] actually, you know, create chaos in
[08:46] Canada. I don't think Canada survives
[08:48] any of this. I think Canada's finished.
[08:49] I think it's over. I think it can
[08:51] survive. It can survive for a million
[08:53] reasons, but in the end, it will be
[08:55] Bitcoin that that ties the bow for
[08:58] people to understand why Canada can't
[09:00] survive. And so that's chaos. That's
[09:03] pure chaos right there. And you uh have
[09:07] in your Twitter banner uh I love that
[09:10] like the fiat apocalypse. Uh basically,
[09:13] is that kind of the beginning stages of
[09:15] of what we see uh there? Yeah, I think
[09:19] so. And that and that's you know
[09:20] apocalypse just means the end of time
[09:22] and time of course is money. We
[09:24] understand that as Bitcoiners some
[09:26] people call Bitcoin the time chain. Uh
[09:28] time 100% the old colloquialism go I
[09:31] don't know if such a thing exists in in
[09:33] the German language but I know in in
[09:37] English time is money. We we're all
[09:39] convinced time is money and it seems
[09:42] true and it feels true and and they're
[09:44] both finite resources. we spend them on
[09:46] things and whether they're useful or
[09:48] not. Um, it is the end of one time when
[09:50] it comes to the fiat apocalypse. And I
[09:52] think so I think that Canada has been
[09:55] kept together using fiat trickery and
[09:58] again go back to the psychological
[10:00] engine piece that that an economy really
[10:02] is. You know, I I use the word
[10:04] psychological engine as a proxy for
[10:06] economy. I think that economics I think
[10:07] they're the same thing. And the Canadian
[10:10] psychological engine has sputtered along
[10:14] for a long time using types of
[10:16] manipulation
[10:18] that have set it up to fail. You know,
[10:21] more or less Canada uses a taxation
[10:24] power to shift money from different
[10:26] places in the country. My home state of
[10:28] Quebec is one of the richest states in
[10:31] the world. We've got a hundred and we've
[10:34] got 600 billion Canadian trash token
[10:36] sovereign wealth fund. uh and 39 gawatt
[10:40] of electricity available at our disposal
[10:43] because of our hydroelectric dams. We we
[10:45] have a nuclear reactor we run for fun.
[10:46] We don't even have it plugged into the
[10:48] grid and it's to sell nuclear reactors
[10:50] to other areas. So we we create a
[10:52] reactor that Korea bought for many years
[10:54] and now copies and knows how to make
[10:56] themselves. But that was a market of
[10:58] export for Canada. We could export
[10:59] nuclear reactors and we're very good at
[11:01] building them. Um, but the way Canada
[11:04] screwed the way Quebec screwed the rest
[11:06] of Canada and and I'm a I'm a proud
[11:08] Quebecer. I love my home state. So, this
[11:10] is no this is no criticism of my home
[11:13] state and my home province of Quebec.
[11:15] It's more that what happened was we made
[11:17] a deal where our hydroele electricity
[11:19] doesn't actually count in our GDP and
[11:21] when they make this transfer of money
[11:24] between the country, it's based on GDP
[11:26] numbers. So, imagine we understand
[11:29] energy is the economy. Bitcoiners
[11:31] understand energy is the most important
[11:33] factor in an economy. It's the most
[11:35] important factor in this psychological
[11:37] engine to get an economy to perpetuate
[11:39] forward. If you have a lot of energy, if
[11:40] you're Texas, you can be stupid and make
[11:42] mistakes and it doesn't really matter
[11:44] because you have enough electricity. If
[11:46] you're uh in Quebec, you can be a
[11:48] socialist country and it doesn't really
[11:50] matter because you have so much
[11:52] electricity that you can pay for the
[11:54] excess. You know, a place like Germany
[11:55] that I saw yesterday demolished a
[11:58] six-year-old coal power plant because
[12:01] Greta wasn't happy about it is not a
[12:04] good sign for their psychological state.
[12:06] But what kept Canada together was, you
[12:09] know, Alberta didn't get to subtract its
[12:11] oil resources from this equation. So
[12:13] Alberta actually sends that money over
[12:15] to Quebec every year about 14 billion
[12:17] Canadian trash tokens a year in order to
[12:20] subsidize Quebec staying in the
[12:22] federation. So, uh, I learned at a time
[12:25] when my state when I was a young man
[12:27] tried to separate from Canada and the
[12:28] vote was so close, it was 50.3 to 49.7
[12:31] to stay in Canada at the time. And the
[12:36] the excuse or the the blame that the
[12:40] separatist powers gave, the sovereignist
[12:42] powers of Quebec gave were it was money.
[12:45] Money is what did it. The Bank of Canada
[12:46] is what did it. bank and the economic
[12:48] threats, the psychological threats to
[12:50] your bank account, to your bottom line.
[12:51] Literally, uh, a man with guns argument
[12:54] was made by Canada by saying, "You're
[12:56] not going to be able to use our money."
[12:58] And how are they going to stop that? How
[12:59] are they going to stop Quebecers from
[13:01] using the Canadian dollar those, you
[13:03] know, 20, 30 years ago? Um, the answer
[13:07] was, you have to use your imagination,
[13:09] but at a certain point, they had to go
[13:11] into people's bank accounts and homes to
[13:12] take out their Canadian dollars, and
[13:14] that was getting sketchy. But it's what
[13:16] worked, that fear-mongering work. Now,
[13:18] without a Bank of Canada, without that
[13:20] institution, there's nothing that will
[13:22] keep the country together and so it will
[13:24] break apart. Is that ultimately where
[13:26] Bitcoin leads every country uh
[13:28] decentralizing the power of it and and
[13:30] and making it shrink? Well, I think so.
[13:34] The United States would be the exception
[13:35] to the rule because the United States
[13:37] was formed as a
[13:40] decentralized agreement to begin with.
[13:42] The United States protocol, the real
[13:45] original protocol of the US
[13:47] Constitution, underlined that each of
[13:49] those individual states were sovereign
[13:53] countries to themselves that shared very
[13:55] few competencies. Now, war and the
[13:57] finance of war is what altered our
[14:00] linguistic understanding of America. It
[14:03] actually went down to our operating
[14:05] protocol of English and how we ran that
[14:07] in America. It's very simple formula
[14:08] though. If you look at America after the
[14:11] revolutionary war in 1776 and up to the
[14:14] US Civil War in 1860, the way you would
[14:18] have described America in the English
[14:19] language is you would have said the
[14:21] United States are. You would have said
[14:23] that. You would have said the United
[14:24] States are. You'd have used a plural uh
[14:26] to be verb. You would conjugate it
[14:28] plural. After the US Civil War in 1860,
[14:31] you started to say the United States is.
[14:33] From then on, you said you thought of it
[14:35] as an as a a a
[14:38] unified sovereign state, not a state
[14:41] comprised of many individual sovereign
[14:43] states. Uh you would have said these
[14:46] United States are and then you f you
[14:48] started to say the United States is
[14:49] after that. So the civil war had this
[14:51] big linguistic effect really because it
[14:53] was all an exercise in war finance. Now
[14:56] this goes up right up to the second
[14:57] world war. Up until the Second World
[14:59] War, you would have easily said the
[15:00] United States are. I'm having internet
[15:03] troubles for some reason here. Um I hope
[15:06] I'm coming through well. Uh normally I
[15:08] don't. Yeah, I I hear you good. I hear
[15:10] you good. Yeah, I think it's fine. So
[15:12] after the the the Second World War, what
[15:15] you started to hear was the federal
[15:17] government is you even got away from the
[15:19] idea of plurality in the United States.
[15:21] You hear the Fed is, the federal
[15:22] government is, the Fed is, the federal
[15:24] government, the US, Washington DC is.
[15:26] Now, all of that was created, you know,
[15:28] every everything America did to win
[15:30] World War II, they basically never shut
[15:32] off. They kept the aircraft carriers
[15:34] running. They kept the institutions that
[15:36] were built, the Washington DC
[15:38] institutions that were built in order to
[15:41] win World War II. What we're really
[15:42] going through here in World War II is a
[15:44] psychological and economic war. I don't
[15:46] think it's very kinetic. It's got some
[15:48] Don't tell that to the Ukrainians and
[15:49] the Russians and other people. Of
[15:50] course, there is moments of connective
[15:53] kinetic warfare going on. I would say
[15:55] even Tesla dealerships have become a
[15:58] location of kinetic warfare right now in
[16:01] America. There's definitely some kinetic
[16:03] aspects to World War II. But in general,
[16:06] the right way or the way I think about
[16:08] it is as an economic and psychological
[16:11] war. We see it with the US aid
[16:12] persuasion stuff. We see it with the
[16:14] nudging. We see with the scihops. We see
[16:17] with the sophisticated manner in which
[16:21] uh propaganda is spread around and and
[16:24] money is behind that. If you follow the
[16:25] money, you'll get a better sense of what
[16:27] the fault lines of World War II are.
[16:29] Now, most nations that fall under this
[16:32] um you know that that that fall outside
[16:35] of the United States system don't have
[16:37] this fall back of decentralized
[16:41] uh organization to go into. Now, what I
[16:43] do believe is going to happen is that
[16:45] other states are going to join the
[16:47] United States going forward and they're
[16:49] going to bring a reinvigoration of
[16:52] sovereign ideas to each individual
[16:54] state. So, when I just mentioned that
[16:56] Alberta, there will be a 51st state and
[16:58] it will be in Canada. Canada is not you
[17:00] can't add Canada as a 51st state, but
[17:03] you can add pieces of Canada as a 51st
[17:06] state to the United States. So when
[17:07] Alberta with the fourth largest oil
[17:09] reserves in the world, you know, Alberta
[17:11] being a landlocked state requires a good
[17:13] neighbor, Canada ain't it. Everything I
[17:15] just explained about the federal
[17:17] transfer of money and they're not
[17:18] building them any pipelines. They're not
[17:20] doing anything for them, right? They're
[17:21] on their own. Trump is going to build
[17:23] them a a pipeline. He's going to build
[17:25] them the Keystone Excel pipeline and
[17:27] that's going to bring about a million
[17:28] barrels of oil a day. So Canada right
[17:30] now is being held together. The whole
[17:32] ability to keep Canada together comes
[17:34] down to about two million people in the
[17:36] state of Alberta. The state of Alberta
[17:38] not much bigger than Austria, you know,
[17:40] maybe five million people total. Um, not
[17:44] a huge place. Any referendum that
[17:46] happens there would have to take into
[17:49] account the transfer payments. They want
[17:52] to make more money. They need a port to
[17:54] get their product out to market. You got
[17:56] a ton of Bitcoin mining there happening
[17:58] simply because they can't get their
[17:59] product out, but they do want to get
[18:01] their product out and they have, like I
[18:02] said, just an unbelievable amount and
[18:04] supply of this stuff to get out of the
[18:06] ground, but nowhere to put it. So
[18:09] eventually, what I think you'll see is a
[18:10] state like Alberta can join the American
[18:13] Union, but not as one that's going to
[18:15] join every federal federal institution
[18:18] in Washington DC. It's actually going to
[18:20] bring a counter force, a decentralizing
[18:22] force, a reinvigoration of uh
[18:25] decentralization and sovereign state
[18:28] consciousness to the United States
[18:30] union. And that will allow for more
[18:32] participants to join. You're going to
[18:34] have a great increase in what the United
[18:36] States of America are. I can imagine a
[18:38] place like El Salvador even joining the
[18:40] United States of America in a very loose
[18:42] coalition. So, it's a bit of a choke on
[18:45] the bone situation, right? you you know
[18:47] America absorbs new states and a bit
[18:50] like what happened with China
[18:52] reabsorbing Hong Kong. Be careful what
[18:54] you wish for because you got a bunch of
[18:56] new people in your country in the case
[18:58] of China, but they're not the same as
[19:00] the ones you've had there already.
[19:02] They're bringing something else and that
[19:03] will affect the whole. And I could see
[19:06] Alberta who was got a lot to offer the
[19:08] United States when it comes to
[19:09] negotiating entry as a 51st state. I
[19:12] think they're going to get a sweet deal.
[19:14] And I think that that deal, for example,
[19:16] I think it's going to exempt them from
[19:17] IRS oversight. All kinds of weird things
[19:19] are going to happen. And then I know
[19:21] Americans, right? They're going to say,
[19:23] "Well, I want that, too." They're going
[19:25] to be jealous and it's going to create a
[19:28] whole new consciousness. So I do imagine
[19:30] that that when we hear the United
[19:31] States, you know, we went from the
[19:32] United States are the United States is
[19:35] the United States are, the Fed is, I
[19:37] think we're going to go full circle and
[19:38] World War II will be over linguistically
[19:41] when people start saying the United
[19:42] States are again and we start having a
[19:44] lot more state level sovereignty, state
[19:46] level consciousness erupt. And because
[19:50] it's more about affiliate groups of
[19:52] like-minded people, Bitcoiners are
[19:53] becoming a nation inside of America.
[19:55] We're becoming a a separate people
[19:57] inside of America because we see things
[19:59] this way. You know, we've got cultural
[20:01] hubs all across America now. We've got
[20:03] Micro Strategy opening its own Bitcoin
[20:06] studio and cultural hub in Washington
[20:08] DC. We've got Pub Key in New York. We've
[20:10] got the Bitcoin Commons. We've got one
[20:12] in San Francisco. Uh this stuff is going
[20:14] to continue to be I think a big trends
[20:16] setter when it comes to public debate
[20:18] content the ability to move the needle,
[20:21] move the narrative, coalesce around
[20:23] Bitcoin culture, which will continue to
[20:25] spread outwards. It'll affect the grid.
[20:28] It's going to affect farming. It's going
[20:30] to affect health. It's going to affect
[20:31] every aspect of America. That's super
[20:34] interesting. uh the decentralized
[20:36] protocol of America because I I do think
[20:39] um having a coalition between countries
[20:42] makes sense. Uh but I also see that
[20:45] actually it was funny because Elon Musk
[20:47] actually published a funny meme uh the
[20:50] European countries love to being
[20:53] governed. So even the governments have a
[20:55] government with the European uh union.
[20:58] But then I was wondering, isn't that the
[21:00] same thing in the United States with the
[21:02] federal government and then there's like
[21:05] state level?
[21:06] Well, only only in that. So, it used to
[21:10] have a little more federalism. The the
[21:12] wars took that away. So, I'll explain.
[21:14] There's still the representation by
[21:16] population in and the Congress. So, you
[21:18] vote for your county who sends a
[21:20] representative in your behalf to the
[21:22] federal level who deals with only
[21:24] federal jurisdictions. So I guess
[21:26] another way to think about it is and I
[21:29] don't know if this is the case in
[21:30] Europe, but we we've come to believe
[21:33] federal and state are like senior and
[21:35] junior levels like like a hierarchy.
[21:38] That's not the way it was set up.
[21:39] They're co-equals. They split and divide
[21:41] power and some are 100% powerful in this
[21:44] field and others are 100% powerful in
[21:47] this field. The federal government was
[21:48] given very little actually in the
[21:50] toolbox. There's not really a lot there.
[21:52] Most of that was invented in order to
[21:54] win those wars. The powers that Abraham
[21:56] Lincoln took over and assumed in order
[21:59] to win that war actually had a
[22:00] repercussion. The power of the federal
[22:02] government descended greatly after the
[22:04] Civil War. You It's hard to even name a
[22:06] president between Lincoln and Teddy
[22:09] Roosevelt when the new practice of the
[22:12] US president became standardized leading
[22:15] up to World War I and those conflicts
[22:17] and and the the idea of the current
[22:19] president, the leader of the free world.
[22:21] this is a fake title from World War II.
[22:24] That mean that doesn't have to there's
[22:26] nothing in the constitution that says
[22:27] you're the leader of the free world.
[22:29] Like there's nothing like that. So there
[22:32] there is
[22:33] a sure it could be a little like Europe,
[22:36] but but here's the other counterweights
[22:38] to that, right? Um so first of all,
[22:41] we've got our Senate, which is the
[22:43] federative body. So the Senate equalizes
[22:46] all federal entities, all states in that
[22:49] every state gets two. So, my home state
[22:51] of Vermont, which doesn't even have a
[22:53] million people, we've got two senators.
[22:56] California, which has 40 million people,
[22:58] has two senators. Now, they have way
[23:00] more congressman than we have. We don't
[23:02] we we don't even have enough population
[23:03] for one real congressman. We have to
[23:05] have a congressman because it's in the
[23:06] Constitution. But we have a Congress. We
[23:08] have more senators who are more powerful
[23:10] than congressman in the United States
[23:12] system. Now, it was even more amazing
[23:14] before the Civil War because before the
[23:17] Civil War, the Senate was not directly
[23:19] elected. The Senate was appointed by the
[23:22] individual state capitals, the state
[23:25] legislators, the state governments. Just
[23:27] those representatives would vote on who
[23:30] to send as a senator. So that uh
[23:32] injected a lot more decentralization and
[23:35] a lot more state sovereignty. These were
[23:37] not normal politicians. They didn't have
[23:38] to go out and get a popular mandate.
[23:40] They just had to get the political
[23:41] mandate from their state to represent
[23:43] them. So there's there's forces that can
[23:46] be reawakened inside of the American
[23:48] system, especially if we liquidate
[23:50] Washington DC, which is what DOA is
[23:52] doing. DOA is DOA is more or less
[23:54] turning off the World War II war machine
[23:58] in ways that we're only just perceiving
[24:01] now, the propaganda parts, the actual
[24:04] human capital that was there. But that's
[24:06] what's being wound down now. the fake
[24:08] abstraction that was created in
[24:10] Washington DC to win the World War II
[24:12] that stayed operational for 80 years
[24:16] past and now in its dying days is doing
[24:19] all kinds of flailing to survive, but
[24:21] we're going to shut it down and it looks
[24:24] like it's in the cards. So, Donald Trump
[24:26] looks like he's there to shut down
[24:29] whatever happened in World War II. The
[24:31] engine is getting shut off and something
[24:33] new is going to come. Yeah, that's also
[24:34] in in in the in the small research that
[24:37] I did uh because I actually had the
[24:39] question in my mind after that tweet
[24:40] like okay how is actually the United
[24:42] States difference like what what are the
[24:44] actual difference one big one also that
[24:46] you haven't mentioned is that Donald
[24:48] Trump is elected directly uh which I
[24:51] think is a very positive thing uh in EU
[24:54] all the commissioners all the the people
[24:56] they're just indirectly like you you
[24:58] vote for an EU parliament uh and then
[25:01] they are going ahead and electing
[25:03] someone which is for me not an not an
[25:06] election like you you should have the
[25:09] power to elect that person and that's a
[25:12] big big difference that that I really uh
[25:15] dislike about the EU uh among many other
[25:18] things that I dislike about the EU. Uh
[25:21] but but it's in America now. The ooh ooh
[25:28] I love that. It's the Ooh. Ooh.
[25:31] Yeah. They they're doing a lot of stupid
[25:33] things to be honest. Uh a lot of weird
[25:36] small things also. Uh I don't know if
[25:39] you're aware of that, but you know with
[25:41] with bottles there are the bottle cap
[25:43] one. It's the best. You you know about
[25:45] that here because we have stupid British
[25:48] the island that I live on in the winters
[25:50] has this stupid a lot of British imports
[25:52] and I have that ridiculous bottle cap
[25:55] you have when I'm down here. I hate it
[25:56] like there's no tomorrow. I hate it. It
[25:59] cuts my lip like I rip it off. You can't
[26:01] rip it off cuz then you've got a little
[26:04] weapon on that thing that it's going to
[26:06] poke your lip all the time. It's the
[26:08] worst. Yeah. I I actually also always
[26:12] cut it open and but it does hurt on the
[26:14] lips too. I have to be honest. But but
[26:17] without if if you don't cut it, if you
[26:19] don't rip it off, I cannot drink
[26:21] anyways. Like then I need a class your
[26:23] face. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no. It's
[26:25] a disaster. It's a disaster. Like an
[26:27] actual disaster.
[26:30] And the thing is it's uh for me that
[26:33] is a a a one small symbol of how bad the
[26:38] bureaucracy got to be in the EU. It it
[26:41] is bad of course but it's like a small
[26:44] detail. Uh but it's an overall sign how
[26:47] bad for me personally the bureaucracy
[26:49] is. uh and I do hope that overall we
[26:53] just come back to more decentralized
[26:55] lineup of countries and countries have
[26:57] to more uh compete to each other of
[27:00] their citizens. I I and I think that's
[27:02] where it's headed. I think the brain
[27:03] drain in Europe is real. Um I think that
[27:07] the the people moving out of Europe are
[27:09] going to have a big effect on on the the
[27:12] the way it's governed. And you know,
[27:15] I'll I'll I'll even say, look, the the
[27:19] going back to America and the chaos, the
[27:21] same as Canada, the way it's affecting
[27:22] Canada and what's going on in Europe is
[27:25] in the same boat, right? Europe isn't
[27:27] going to be able to rely on Fed reserve
[27:29] swap lines to sustain the euro if
[27:32] anything goes south. Moreover, Europe's
[27:35] now got to pay for all this war stuff. I
[27:37] guess like that's a new thing. Like you
[27:38] got to pay for all these weapons. A lot
[27:40] of what you see in Europe, like first of
[27:42] all, Europe, like Canadians, don't have
[27:45] natural immunity to American propaganda
[27:47] and brainwashing. There's an idea of
[27:50] superiority in Europe. I went to a fancy
[27:52] European political science school in
[27:54] France. I saw it firsthand, right? that
[27:57] people sort of oh America is like
[27:59] unsophisticated without understanding
[28:01] that they're being gamed the whole time
[28:03] by a very big country with very
[28:06] sophisticated and very low IQ pleb you
[28:08] know 80 IQ people too America is just a
[28:11] big place there's there's all kinds of
[28:12] stuff going on but there's no natural
[28:14] immunity in the same way that it's you
[28:17] know that it's easy to like hypnotize
[28:18] doctors and and and people like that
[28:21] because they believe they're not
[28:22] susceptible to this whereas
[28:24] hypnotizing sort of a a natural ly
[28:27] skeptical person. The vaccines were a
[28:30] part of this. Like I don't know anything
[28:31] about vaccines, but the people who were
[28:33] just like low IQ. I don't trust the
[28:36] government. It's the bell curve IQ thing
[28:37] with the hooded and the guy and then
[28:39] everyone in the middle, right? It's that
[28:41] it's that thing played out. Europe just
[28:43] has so much in that middle that they
[28:45] don't understand that that some of this
[28:48] stuff is actually beyond them.
[28:50] But more importantly, uh, more
[28:53] importantly, a lot of European policy,
[28:55] and this is where I think that the the
[28:57] the biggest blind spot is a lot of
[29:00] European politics to me just look like a
[29:03] spoiled teenager who never had to make
[29:05] critical decisions in life because their
[29:07] father was cutting the Sunday night
[29:10] roast for them every Sunday night and
[29:12] putting food on the table. And that's
[29:13] what America was able to do. America's
[29:15] incredible success and incredible
[29:17] wealth, especially military stuff. You
[29:20] know, America is not a country like
[29:22] Europe. It's an empire. It's a literal
[29:24] empire. And they have different concerns
[29:26] than a country has. They have empire
[29:28] concerns. And so that's where all this
[29:31] military spending came from. The cost of
[29:34] violence in America, they could bear it.
[29:36] They were able to pay for this stuff.
[29:38] And what that set up was this European
[29:40] Union that was like a spoiled teenager
[29:42] that didn't have to be serious about
[29:44] anything. That could waste all their
[29:45] time on bottle caps and dumb stuff and
[29:48] Gret, how's Greta feeling? Oh my god,
[29:51] Greta is upset. Blow up a coal mine or a
[29:55] coal power plant. So a lot of what
[29:58] happened in Europe with no fault of the
[30:00] European people, it was just they had a
[30:03] government who had security guarantees
[30:05] from America. It's the same as having
[30:07] your rent paid in some ways. It's the
[30:08] same as having your life subsidized by
[30:11] your parents as a teenager. You know
[30:13] that that's a big thing I noticed. But
[30:15] but for for example, like I went to Sian
[30:18] Po in France for school and none of
[30:21] these French kids that I went to school
[30:22] with had ever had a job in their life.
[30:24] Like not not a job, not a summer job. In
[30:27] America, if you're a boy and you're not
[30:29] working when you're 13 years old over
[30:31] summer holidays, you're in trouble. like
[30:33] you're in trouble because you can't
[30:35] afford to go with your friends and spend
[30:37] money and do stuff. We all worked at
[30:39] McDonald's and made French fries and
[30:42] worked in restaurants and wash dishes.
[30:44] It doesn't even if you're rich, your
[30:46] parents make you do that, right? That
[30:47] that's like a thing you have to do when
[30:49] you're young. And this was like not
[30:52] understood by kids I went to school
[30:54] with. They did they never even heard of
[30:56] that. They didn't know that Americans
[30:57] had to live that way. Now, it's a bit
[30:59] changing. You know, the world has
[31:01] changed. So, I don't know if it's as
[31:02] ubiquitous as it was when we were
[31:03] younger, but
[31:05] um it's it's still a thing. and Europe
[31:09] just sort of has lived in this state of
[31:12] of you know and here's I guess another
[31:14] even a I don't know how to explain this
[31:17] but um there was a a French sociologist
[31:19] back in the 60s who made a a look at our
[31:22] politics and he said you know what it's
[31:24] not like it's not a bunch of ideas that
[31:27] people have that create the polit and
[31:29] we're and then one day we're all going
[31:30] to agree on a political system he said
[31:32] just look at family units look at the
[31:34] hereditary family units and how family
[31:37] is constructed and you'll actually be
[31:38] able to derive political systems out of
[31:40] that. So did you know that the fascist
[31:42] map of the world directly graphs onto
[31:45] the primagenure map of the world? You
[31:47] know what primogenature is? The
[31:48] firstborn male gets everything. The
[31:51] firstborn male inherits the whole bit.
[31:53] Right? So that's actually northern
[31:54] France, Germany, much of Scandinavia,
[31:58] Japan, and South Korea. Now what this
[32:00] teaches males is that you're the world's
[32:03] inherently unfair. There's nothing you
[32:04] can do about that. But to be successful,
[32:07] you've got to be amazing. You got to be
[32:08] great at everything. You got to be
[32:10] charismatic. You got to be excellent.
[32:12] And it creates an obsession with fashion
[32:15] as well. By the way, that's a weird
[32:17] thing because you got to be a peacock
[32:18] male. You got to stand out. You got to
[32:20] be uh attractive at all times, good at
[32:23] all times, excellent at all times, put
[32:25] together at all times. Um the communist
[32:28] map of the world, right, is really just
[32:30] graphs on the long house living where
[32:33] extended families live together. So,
[32:34] Spain, Italy, south of France, Russia,
[32:37] China. They're used to parts of the
[32:39] family going off in the corner, deciding
[32:42] stuff on their own, and everyone just
[32:44] kind of assumes it's for the better of
[32:45] the family. So, it's it's okay to live
[32:47] that way. Um, you've got the Middle
[32:49] East, which is heavily family organized,
[32:52] weddings, and marriages. So, the
[32:55] religion and the family part is in, you
[32:58] know, can't be separated from the
[33:00] government. Then this weird abstraction
[33:02] England and America where the oh Quebec
[33:06] would be the other example of
[33:07] primogenitor Quebec which has got a very
[33:09] top- down it likes things like Germany
[33:12] they can they can have a high trust
[33:14] society where they just tell everyone
[33:15] what to do like in Sweden or something
[33:17] and everybody just actually does it and
[33:19] it works out right like like Japan too
[33:21] it's like but that's another one of
[33:22] these primogenature things right it was
[33:24] like how inheritance went but this weird
[33:27] little quirk of
[33:28] Anglo-Americans where democ democracy
[33:30] comes from. It's inheritance. They're
[33:32] like, I'm going to give it to all my
[33:33] kids. H whoever is cool, you know, gets
[33:36] whatever. And if you're a jerk, I won't
[33:38] give you anything. And but if you're
[33:39] cool like everyone else, you all get the
[33:41] same. And that's like literally the
[33:43] democracies of the world. It's just a
[33:44] couple of inheritant weird British
[33:46] inheritance rights that spilled over to
[33:48] America with a sense of fairness and
[33:51] that's it. That's the whole game.
[33:53] Um, so you know the the the the effects
[33:57] of this of these politics mean that
[34:00] there is still going to be a
[34:02] decentralized way of practicing these
[34:04] different systems. Like I don't think
[34:06] Quebec, even if it goes full Bitcoin,
[34:08] even if it goes full um um uh energy
[34:13] rich or or Japan, they're still going to
[34:16] have a type of top- down society. That's
[34:18] what they like. Uh, I think a lot of
[34:21] those places in Europe that I just
[34:22] mentioned, Northern France, Belgium,
[34:24] Germany, they're still going to want
[34:26] structure. So, decentralization will
[34:29] still fit different areas, the way they
[34:32] practice and live their lives and the
[34:33] way they construct their families. And I
[34:36] think that's the way it's going to
[34:37] continue to shake out. Let's take a
[34:39] break for a moment and appreciate the
[34:41] beauty that Coin Vigilante has made with
[34:44] the Bitcoin watches. Those watches are
[34:47] the most amazing, the most elegant way
[34:50] of showing that you are a true
[34:53] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[34:55] dropped a completely new and amazing
[34:58] Genesis edition of their watch
[35:01] collections. You have the date of the
[35:03] first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[35:06] there. And of course, also the block
[35:08] height and which epoch we are currently
[35:11] in. I love the level of detail they put
[35:14] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[35:17] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[35:19] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[35:22] love those watches so so much. And now,
[35:25] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[35:28] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[35:30] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[35:32] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[35:34] first way is you put it on a hardware
[35:36] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[35:39] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[35:42] Bitbox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[35:45] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[35:48] if you check out the link in the
[35:50] description, you even get 5% off if you
[35:52] use the code Robin. And the second way
[35:55] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[35:58] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[36:01] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[36:04] They will personalize for you a
[36:07] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[36:09] your individual situation. They will
[36:12] show you how you can secure your own
[36:15] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[36:17] enough. You also have to keep all your
[36:19] devices secure. One topic that is
[36:21] overlooked often is the inheritance
[36:24] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[36:27] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[36:29] a plan for that in place already? And
[36:32] last but not least, if you're in a
[36:33] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[36:36] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[36:38] that, head over to the
[36:42] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[36:45] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[36:48] be for the first time ever speaking at
[36:50] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[36:53] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[36:56] really looking forward to seeing all of
[36:58] you there. You can get your ticket in
[37:00] the link down in the description of
[37:03] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[37:05] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[37:09] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[37:10] there. That's super interesting. And and
[37:13] for me also, I mean, you have mentioned
[37:15] a lot of interesting things. Um maybe
[37:18] let's get into this concept of World War
[37:21] 3. and and there there not a lot of
[37:23] people that actually uh talk out loud
[37:25] about that information war that we have
[37:27] and and we definitely have one. is like
[37:29] very very obvious. Uh which uh with
[37:33] social media and a and a in a connected
[37:36] world it makes it even uh more
[37:38] interesting and I actually use the term
[37:41] digital soldier a lot of like I see
[37:44] myself as a digital soldier of the
[37:47] Bitcoin revolution. uh because maybe uh
[37:51] hundreds of years ago, we also have it
[37:53] now like there are soldiers as you said
[37:55] in the Ukraine that actually fight uh
[37:57] but most soldiers right now is
[38:00] narrative. We have communist narrative,
[38:03] we have liberal narratives, we have
[38:04] conservative narratives, we have Bitcoin
[38:06] fiat narratives, we have all the
[38:08] different narratives and I'm just a
[38:10] soldier for a economics and Bitcoin and
[38:14] uh th those kind of things. uh but there
[38:16] are a lot of other people on the other
[38:18] side and we trying to to push a
[38:21] narrative onto the world in that
[38:23] information war uh and that's super
[38:25] interesting. I never connected that with
[38:27] this is World War II and we are already
[38:30] in it and we are fighting it. Uh that
[38:32] that's a that's an interesting way to
[38:34] look at what what would you say like
[38:36] usually there is something to be fought
[38:39] or what in a war. What are we fighting
[38:42] for in in this World War II information
[38:44] narrative war? Um I I think it's about
[38:47] how information propagates around the
[38:49] world. I I think it's Nakamoto consensus
[38:52] versus whatever system fiat use which
[38:55] has a lot less fault tolerance. I'll say
[38:58] our fall tolerance literally is 51 well
[39:01] 49% you know 51% attack. So our fall
[39:04] tolerance is up to 49% of broken nodes
[39:07] in the network. So I often say that that
[39:10] you know Bitcoin isn't just a P2P P2P
[39:12] electronic network. It's a P2P
[39:14] information network. We're able to use
[39:16] each other to filter ideas. And you know
[39:20] what what AI taught me is that you know
[39:23] remember the beginning debate about AI
[39:25] and it's like are we when is it smarter
[39:27] than us? I got news for you. We're not
[39:29] that smart. This whole thing that humans
[39:31] are rational. This is insane. No one is
[39:34] rational. All human decision is made
[39:36] either by fear or desire. Now we are
[39:40] able to rationalize those fears and
[39:42] desires after the fact and we call that
[39:44] intelligence. But watching AI function
[39:47] with prompt engineering, to me, this is
[39:50] exactly how humans work, right? We can
[39:52] all be prompt engineered. There's almost
[39:54] no way around it. We're pattern
[39:56] recognition machines. That's the
[39:57] operating system. And if I start a
[40:00] pattern, if I go 3, 6, 9, you have to
[40:02] finish it in your brain. I've prompted
[40:04] you. There's no way you can't see the
[40:06] next number in the pattern. You're
[40:08] incapable. Unless you're one of these
[40:09] low IQ people that doesn't know how to
[40:11] count, right? which is again what we
[40:12] were saying that there's an immunity
[40:14] there of being a low IQ psycho. So when
[40:17] you do the 369 and then you see the
[40:20] pattern, your brain will want to fill in
[40:21] the blank and that's how fiat
[40:24] propagation has worked for so long. It
[40:26] understands patterns. It presents
[40:28] patterns and it comes in this top down
[40:31] structure, right? We know that fiat
[40:33] which basically means government
[40:34] declarations, right? It means to declare
[40:37] to to to state we actually made money
[40:40] that is government declarations that is
[40:43] literally
[40:44] just things government says is the
[40:47] money. Now to propagate the network you
[40:50] required propaganda. That's why
[40:52] propagate and propaganda are the exact
[40:54] same word. You can't get around the
[40:56] world unless and these ideas can't get
[40:58] around the world unless they are
[41:00] propagated and unless they they funnel
[41:03] around the world in this way. Right? So
[41:05] what we saw was, you know, that that
[41:08] that's what those world wars were really
[41:09] about. This first world war and the
[41:11] second world war, they're really about
[41:12] war finance and how you pay for war and
[41:15] how you figure out how to do it and how
[41:17] you perpetuate these things around the
[41:19] world. America invented the greatest war
[41:21] finance mechanism ever. And your
[41:23] country, I think, shows the battle scars
[41:25] of it, right? We, you know, when when
[41:28] American people say, "How going to build
[41:30] the roads if you don't have taxes?"
[41:31] says, "Well, in your country, your best
[41:33] roads were built by the gold standard
[41:35] people who had no taxation, who build
[41:37] things that will last forever." And if
[41:39] you go back to World War I, you'll find
[41:41] out that Austria and all these places
[41:43] sued for peace again and again and again
[41:45] because they couldn't afford the war.
[41:47] America could afford the war. And we hit
[41:49] it hot. We went crazy and just kept
[41:51] pumping out more stuff. And because we
[41:54] could, we were collateralizing people's
[41:55] birth certificates and dumping debt on
[41:57] their head and paying for weapons that
[42:00] way. This was not possible in a
[42:02] goldbacked nation. And so what we found
[42:05] is indeed World War III is about this
[42:08] thing coming home to roost. Entropy set
[42:10] into the system of collateralizing
[42:11] people's birth certificates. That's why
[42:13] we have to have open borders. We need
[42:14] more collateral. Literally that's just
[42:16] more collateral, right? You need more
[42:18] people to stuff debt on their heads if
[42:20] you want to keep fighting. You give them
[42:22] a social security number. Bang. That's
[42:24] another envelope you can open. That's
[42:26] more debt you can put on the heads of
[42:28] Americans. More American heads. more
[42:30] American debt. That's why when they talk
[42:32] about the debt ceiling, it's about
[42:33] raising the amount of money per head.
[42:35] The other way to get more debt in
[42:36] America was increasing the heads. That
[42:39] was the other way. That's why we've had
[42:40] open borders. This was part of that
[42:42] warfare. And so when I think back on
[42:44] just the fault tolerance, right, this
[42:46] this propaganda propagating fiat, the
[42:49] fault tolerance is actually quite low,
[42:51] right? If 20% notice, the thing starts
[42:54] to come under real stress and has a lot
[42:56] of problems. That's why I often say that
[42:59] I'll take one Bitcoiner over like a
[43:01] thousand NPC no coiners any day because
[43:04] we have the ability in this P2P economic
[43:08] war in this psychological war to have
[43:10] way more of an impact and it is because
[43:13] our fault tolerance in the Bitcoin
[43:14] network allows us to purse through this
[43:17] information to avoid the worst parts of
[43:19] prompt engineering because we can look
[43:21] at each other and we can say did you
[43:22] catch that? Did you catch that? And so
[43:24] information spreads much quicker and
[43:26] more accurately amongst Bitcoiners than
[43:28] it does amongst fiat people. Like is it
[43:31] news to you that Greta is an idiot? No.
[43:34] You know, like you know, Bitcoiners know
[43:37] she's an idiot, right? And that's fine.
[43:39] She can be an idiot. I don't really
[43:40] care. I'm not I don't get angry about
[43:42] it. It's not something that's in my
[43:44] day-to-day life or anything. But that's
[43:46] what's allowed Bitcoiners to traverse
[43:48] this thing. We are all products of our
[43:50] wants and fears. And Bitcoin helps you
[43:54] understand that a little better because
[43:57] with the lowered fault tolerance that we
[43:59] can handle so much bad news, process it
[44:02] and then look out for each other in a
[44:03] decentralized way actually creates a
[44:06] huge forward momentum for us. Uh and the
[44:09] fault tolerance of the fiat system even
[44:11] in Europe, I mean can can a European
[44:13] nation survive 30% of its people saying
[44:16] this is all lies and [ __ ] It
[44:18] couldn't in it couldn't in the Soviet
[44:19] Union, right? Right. It's the same sort
[44:21] of glass nose type um situation where
[44:24] once the whole can't stick, it falls
[44:27] apart. And that's what I think we're
[44:30] seeing in Europe today. I think we're
[44:32] going to start seeing that more. I think
[44:34] the P2P warfare, the hand-to-hand combat
[44:37] um is in effect that that's the problem
[44:39] with the brain drain though in Europe.
[44:40] That's the problem with Europeans
[44:42] leaving is that and Americans because of
[44:44] weirdly because of double taxation, we
[44:47] didn't leave. And so we were stuck in
[44:49] our living rooms, stuck in our kitchens,
[44:51] stuck arguing with all of our friends
[44:52] and family. And it did have a bit more
[44:55] of an effect. Whereas in Europe, they
[44:57] just split, right? And go somewhere
[44:59] else.
[45:01] What do you think is the role of Bitcoin
[45:03] in in that information war? Again, you
[45:06] know, ju just look at what Bitcoin
[45:08] meetup culture has done, right? Bitcoin
[45:10] meetup culture has taught financial
[45:12] literacy, energy literacy, media
[45:15] literacy probably better than any other
[45:19] centralized education system in the
[45:21] history of the world. Universities are
[45:23] nowhere near as successful in teaching
[45:25] us about economics than Bitcoin has
[45:27] been. I mean, Austrian economics has
[45:29] been taught that's what it comes from.
[45:30] Austrian economics is the name of a of
[45:32] like a university or no? No. Is it?
[45:35] Anyway, it was it was an idea that
[45:39] mostly was housed in universities for a
[45:41] long time and academic institutions and
[45:43] things like that, right? We know Chicago
[45:45] was a big Austrian school type of the
[45:48] University of Chicago was a big Austrian
[45:50] institution and even institutions would
[45:52] get labeled with these sort of economic
[45:54] ideas that they helped promote and
[45:56] wanted. But none of these guys were
[45:58] successful. I remember Christopher Gian
[46:00] Carlo, the former head of the CFTC, a
[46:02] big stable coin guy now, um when he was
[46:06] testifying in the United States in 2018
[46:08] about Bitcoin and the futures markets,
[46:11] derivatives, what was going on, he
[46:13] actually said that to the Senate. He
[46:15] said, "Look, I've never seen anything."
[46:16] I was at my Thanksgiving Day table with
[46:19] all these college kids, my kids in
[46:21] college, they came home and they all
[46:22] want to talk about Bitcoin. This is
[46:23] stuff we wanted people to talk about for
[46:25] generations. Bitcoin made it
[46:27] interesting, made it cool, made it easy
[46:29] to understand. If you look at Bitcoin
[46:31] meetups, I know I'm involved in Bitcoin
[46:32] events, right? I produced the Bitcoin
[46:35] conference for Bitcoin magazine for
[46:36] years. Before that, I produced uh
[46:39] Coindesk Consensus in New York. And we
[46:43] really did believe, you know, people
[46:45] would say, how much bigger can these
[46:46] events get? Because we started pretty
[46:48] small. Uh the first one we did in in New
[46:50] York was 2015. And so these were, you
[46:53] know, a thousand people would come and
[46:55] things like that. And people say, you
[46:56] know, every year it got bigger. How big
[46:58] can they get, right? How big can they
[47:00] get? And I would say, well, universities
[47:02] have left us an entirely free field.
[47:05] They're doing nothing. They can't keep
[47:06] up. They're too slow. You can't you
[47:09] can't get a job in our industry going to
[47:11] university. If someone went to Harvard
[47:12] and then comes to me in Bitcoin, and
[47:14] says, "I want a job in Bitcoin." I I'll
[47:16] laugh in their face. I say, "What were
[47:17] you doing all these years? Why why did
[47:18] you go to Harvard? Like you wanted to go
[47:20] to Gary Gensler's MIT lecture across the
[47:23] river. Like what are you even talking
[47:24] about, right? There there's no what's
[47:26] your excuse? I'll take any degenerate
[47:29] Bitcoiner who figured this stuff out on
[47:31] their own and were able to make a career
[47:32] at 18 than your Harvard degree any day
[47:36] of the week. And so we understand that
[47:39] we've promoted and propagated this
[47:42] information much more effectively than
[47:44] any other platform. And so the role of
[47:46] Bitcoin is that P2P nature. the Bitcoin
[47:49] Meetup culture that's been more
[47:51] successful at teaching the most
[47:53] important subjects for 2025 and getting
[47:56] through World War II, which are indeed
[47:57] financial literacy, energy literacy, and
[48:00] economic and and um uh uh media
[48:04] literacy. These three factors, right?
[48:06] Bitcoin is media, Bitcoin is energy, and
[48:09] Bitcoin is economics. And all at once,
[48:11] you're able to become an expert in these
[48:13] three fields, which happen to be the
[48:14] actual battlegrounds of World War II.
[48:17] So, Bitcoiners have dominated these
[48:19] battlegrounds. It's not even close. Uh,
[48:21] that's why if you go to DC today, right,
[48:23] if you go to Washington DC as a
[48:25] Bitcoiner today, you'll be seen in the
[48:29] same way as like a crack team that were
[48:31] heroes in World War II were treated as
[48:34] heroes, right? Because the people who
[48:37] work in politics there didn't see it
[48:39] coming. They didn't see this right hook
[48:42] come in from the tech bros and the
[48:44] Bitcoiners and the Silicon Valley thing
[48:46] which just completely devastated the
[48:49] intellectual claims of the left and was
[48:52] was seen as a shot out of nowhere to a
[48:54] lot of these political staffers and when
[48:57] that injected itself to win this war the
[49:00] way it did after Bitcoin 2024 and seeing
[49:03] all this human capital rush into Bitcoin
[49:05] rush into politics that weren't the
[49:08] usual suspects This had a huge effect on
[49:11] just dinnertime conversations, living
[49:14] room conversations. It's to the point
[49:16] where it made it cool. So, like I said,
[49:18] if you go to DC right now and you're at
[49:20] a political function, they start
[49:22] pointing at Bitcoiners as if we're these
[49:24] mysterious celebrities that literally
[49:27] won important battles in a war for them.
[49:30] Like we're treated as if we're these
[49:32] economic or wartime heroes back from a
[49:36] great victory at D-Day or a great
[49:38] victory at Eoima, some famous thing they
[49:40] read about in the papers. They're like,
[49:41] "Oh, did you see David Bailey is here?
[49:45] Nick Carter is at the party. Oh my god."
[49:48] Ah, you know, like they they
[49:50] mythologized a lot of these people. And
[49:52] so that's that's a big part of why we
[49:55] won and a big repercussion of of what
[49:58] happened.
[50:00] Yeah, the the power shift towards
[50:02] bitcoiners is I think under discussed of
[50:07] uh what happens in a world where those
[50:11] bitcoiners who there's like
[50:13] adiq as we discussed today a lot um have
[50:17] all the capital the resources but then
[50:19] also the status because we have fought
[50:22] and won a war uh and and we know how and
[50:26] why we won. Uh, and and this is
[50:29] something really amazing. And I also
[50:32] love how how you said it. I think in the
[50:34] beginning of this you I think you call
[50:36] it psych psychology revolution. I think
[50:39] I always call it like Bitcoin as a
[50:41] social Yeah. I always call Bitcoin as
[50:43] like a social revolution rather than
[50:46] just a technical one because if it's
[50:48] just a technical one, someone could copy
[50:50] Bitcoin. Uh, and there are a lot of
[50:53] copies from Bitcoin. But it's a social
[50:56] revolution and I like big fan of uh Jeff
[51:00] Booof saying we are Bitcoin like that
[51:02] that's the that's we are the the Bitcoin
[51:05] and this is the social revolution of
[51:07] Bitcoin and I think that's something uh
[51:10] that outside of Bitcoin most Bitcoiners
[51:13] get that like most Bitcoiners that I
[51:15] inform get the social revolution but
[51:17] outside of Bitcoin a lot of people don't
[51:20] see that. They're like, "Oh, but why
[51:21] wouldn't you make the Bitcoin size a
[51:24] little bit bigger to to fit more
[51:26] transaction and and improve that one
[51:28] small feature?" And they're like, "No,
[51:31] it's a social it's it's about the social
[51:34] revolution and not so much about the the
[51:36] technical one, even though the technical
[51:38] one is really
[51:40] genius." And that's a really great point
[51:43] that you made that that's I guess back
[51:45] to the psychological engine piece,
[51:47] right? where and this is where even
[51:49] Bitcoin surprised people in America.
[51:52] America was so long dominated from the
[51:54] tech scene with the fail fast and break
[51:57] things psychological mindset. That's why
[52:00] even this stupid Jason Calcanis guy like
[52:03] a new Bitcoin, a Bitcoin 2.0 upgrade
[52:05] like you know how many times we've been
[52:06] through this. That's what makes Bitcoin
[52:08] stand out against crypto. Crypto is the
[52:10] same as baseball cards, the same as a
[52:12] video game. It's consumer technology,
[52:14] right? It's iPhone 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[52:16] Give me the next one. What makes Bitcoin
[52:19] interesting is that it's defied the
[52:21] consumer technology psychological frame.
[52:24] It's defied this um quality that you've
[52:28] got to be new and exciting. You know,
[52:30] this was fine for video games. It was
[52:32] fine when Zelda came on Nintendo and you
[52:36] could send a patch if something went
[52:38] wrong, if it was just a software glitch.
[52:40] This is these are toys, right? You
[52:42] remember remember there was the Bitstein
[52:44] had a really good dunk on someone who
[52:47] who thought they were bragging, you
[52:48] know, Ethereum is like a Lego piece and
[52:51] Bitcoin is like a brick. Haha, you can
[52:53] build with this. And he goes, "No, no,
[52:54] you have it exact, right? Bitcoin
[52:56] indeed. Brick by brick. You can build
[52:57] giant edififices to do anything you need
[53:01] and house human flourishing and
[53:02] activity. Legos are literally a
[53:04] children's toy. And you can build as
[53:06] much children's toys as you want with
[53:08] them." It's true, but they're toys,
[53:10] right? So that that that's the
[53:11] difference. Now going back to this
[53:14] psychological thing and and this is
[53:15] where when you asked about the ADIQ pleb
[53:17] thing, where things are headed and why
[53:18] this is so revolutionary and important
[53:21] because this gets into the time
[53:22] preference thing. I think a a favorite
[53:24] subject of Bitcoiners, especially
[53:26] Austrian school Bitcoiners, right? What
[53:28] I said earlier about, you know, we're
[53:31] we're just the products of our wants and
[53:33] our fears and these are subconscious and
[53:35] we make decisions based on them. What
[53:38] Bitcoin actually helps you do is
[53:39] reprogram those wants and fears. It goes
[53:42] deep into the subconscious and that's
[53:44] where the time preference stuff ends up
[53:45] actually getting actuated. Right? It is
[53:47] it is not a conscious thing time
[53:49] preference. It's it's a training thing.
[53:51] And that's where the Bitcoiners in this
[53:53] new era of winning all this political
[53:56] clout and winning all of this prestige
[53:58] is really going to start highlighting
[54:01] changes, right? Because Bitcoiners have
[54:03] long shared the ideas around diet and
[54:07] exercise and all these low time
[54:09] preference things that are really vital
[54:12] and important and that's what's going to
[54:14] actually start reshaping how we organize
[54:17] our society. It's the perfect bridge
[54:19] because you know the best and brightest
[54:20] always go into whatever job pays the
[54:22] most right that's just what happens
[54:24] right the job that pays the most the
[54:26] best and brightest want want that job.
[54:27] It doesn't matter what it is. And for so
[54:30] long, we made financial engineer the
[54:32] best job because it was the best paying.
[54:34] So it took the best and brightest in
[54:36] America to go work on Wall Street to go
[54:38] do all these things. Absorbed so much
[54:41] quality human capital that it distorted
[54:44] American human capital in general.
[54:46] Silicon Valley did something very
[54:48] similar. Consumer tech, consumer
[54:49] applications. Now that Bitcoiners are
[54:52] doing it, what actually can come as a
[54:54] result of that is whatever you do and
[54:57] then you put it into Bitcoin starts to
[54:59] become the more important thing, right?
[55:00] We can actually bring back farming and
[55:02] cattle ranching as like the best job you
[55:05] can get because it's great at getting
[55:07] Bitcoin, right? We we're we're going to
[55:09] show the world the next part of this
[55:11] story is actually changing the wants and
[55:14] desires and the fears of human beings to
[55:18] get really in deep into the the the
[55:20] subconscious programming of the human
[55:22] mind. And that's where the software and
[55:25] running the Bitcoin protocol
[55:27] psychologically in your world view is
[55:29] going to pay huge dividends for both
[55:31] humanity and for individual Bitcoiners.
[55:33] Right? We're gonna start to be I I over
[55:36] at Roxom TV, I know we're trying to
[55:38] build out 24 hours of Bitcoin content.
[55:40] You know, we we're a a marketplace for
[55:42] commodities and and US equities, but
[55:45] everything's measured in Bitcoin, right?
[55:47] So, it's a global marketplace, but the
[55:49] only reference is Bitcoin because
[55:50] ultimately again, we win World War II
[55:53] when oil and energy is priced in
[55:55] Bitcoin. That's that's game over. When
[55:56] rich people, right, and you know, a lot
[55:59] of people had the idea that it' be a
[56:00] bunch of plebs holding Bitcoin that was
[56:02] going to change the world. I've long
[56:04] suspected that's not the route we're
[56:05] taking. I've long suspected the route
[56:07] we're taking is to corrupt the richest
[56:09] people in the world so that they define
[56:10] wealth by Bitcoin and to corrupt and
[56:13] infect the energy industry to the point
[56:16] where they only see Bitcoin as the
[56:18] benchmark for their products. Once that
[56:20] happens, it's g that is hyper
[56:21] bitcoinization. It's game over, right?
[56:23] Doesn't matter who's holding Bitcoin.
[56:24] Doesn't matter how many plebs, how many
[56:25] people have it. If the two most
[56:28] important pieces of the global economy
[56:30] that help perpetuate the psychological
[56:32] engine, energy and wealthy people,
[56:34] reference Bitcoin and benchmark their
[56:37] stuff to Bitcoin, game over, right? And
[56:40] we're getting there very quick. That's
[56:41] what's happening with the Treasury
[56:42] debate. That's what's happening with the
[56:44] Bitcoin strategic reserve in America.
[56:46] That's what's happening with
[56:49] um with uh Roxom and Energy. Eventually,
[56:53] America is going to have to make choices
[56:55] about the US dollar with everything
[56:56] that's going on. I doubt BRICS is going
[56:59] to be able to create a reference rate
[57:00] for energy and oil. No one's going to
[57:02] believe China, Russia, Brazil, South
[57:06] Africa. Come on. Like, get out of here.
[57:08] Get the [ __ ] out of here. Uh, I'm not
[57:10] buying oil from these guys. Sorry. And
[57:12] I'm not believing their rate or
[57:14] anything. Right. And I think eventually
[57:16] America is going to have choices to make
[57:17] as well. Right. It's got to serve its
[57:19] people. And the money is about to become
[57:21] food stamps. exactly what they wanted,
[57:23] government policy, right? They want the
[57:24] money to be the money to be government
[57:26] policy based, government words based.
[57:28] They're going to get exactly what they
[57:29] wanted. The universe delivers to them
[57:30] what they asked for. Food stamps. It's
[57:33] all going to be food stamps. Europe
[57:34] European Union money. So, we're entering
[57:37] bimetalism, right, which is the the
[57:39] period that preceded the the US dollar,
[57:42] right? Biimedalism was the economic
[57:44] system of America before the Federal
[57:47] Reserve. by metalism. Just one money for
[57:48] consuming, one money for saving, one
[57:51] money for your coffee, one money for
[57:52] your Coca-Cola, one money because you
[57:55] worked hard and you want to put it away.
[57:56] It was silver and gold at one time. It's
[57:59] going to be fiat government policy money
[58:01] and Bitcoin. Eventually, we'll get to
[58:03] full hyper bitcoinization, but I I see
[58:05] us in this in this middle ground for a
[58:07] little while. It's going to be how we
[58:09] how we perpetuate the country. um and in
[58:13] Europe as well and all these places. But
[58:15] but eventually the Bitcoin aesthetic,
[58:18] the Bitcoin subconscious programming
[58:20] towards low time preference is going to
[58:23] be the most desirable thing. And again,
[58:26] we are not rational people. You can't
[58:29] teach health as a intellectual subject.
[58:32] You can make people want that. People
[58:35] can say, I want to look like that. I
[58:36] want to be like that. I want to blah
[58:38] blah blah. And that's what Bitcoiners
[58:40] are going to continue to perpetuate.
[58:42] When I said this thing about the the
[58:44] political staffers, pointing at
[58:46] Bitcoiners and seeing them as
[58:47] celebrities, this has another part to it
[58:50] as it goes forward. And the next part is
[58:52] going to be, wow, he's a farmer. I I got
[58:55] a farm in Vermont. You know, Bitcoiners
[58:57] are turning into farmers left, right,
[58:58] and center. And you can see it with the
[59:01] birth rate amongst Bitcoiners, the
[59:03] accent on family, the accent on
[59:06] parenthood. Um, this is all very new
[59:09] stuff. Old stuff but new. And Bitcoiners
[59:13] of course envy these things amongst each
[59:15] other. What What are we willing to spend
[59:16] our Bitcoin on? I will spend my Bitcoin
[59:18] on family stuff, on how we live, how we
[59:22] spend our time, on steak, right? I never
[59:25] have a problem giving someone Bitcoin if
[59:27] they're giving me a nice, you know, part
[59:29] of a cow. Um, so I think in Europe
[59:33] that'll be the same story, right?
[59:35] Bitcoiners in Europe are going to be
[59:37] able to Europe has so much to brag about
[59:40] and yet the the feeling there is so low
[59:43] right now. Wait until some of these
[59:45] people go and build Bitcoin citadels and
[59:48] abandon Italian mountain towns
[59:51] and we end up seeing the true capacity
[59:55] and beauty that that Europe still has.
[59:57] the it's really a shame because Europe
[60:00] is such a beautiful continent to live in
[60:03] the the the the old buildings, the
[60:07] landscapes, the beaches, the the
[60:09] mountains, the lakes. It's it's so
[60:12] beautiful and then at the same time we
[60:14] have that
[60:16] bureaucracy and that weird political
[60:20] apparatus on top of us. Um and I would
[60:24] love to live forever in Europe. Uh and
[60:28] I've the the more I travel the actually
[60:31] the more I see the beauty of Europe
[60:33] which is uh uh uh really cool but at the
[60:38] same time I'm like okay there are
[60:40] especially because I' have zero income
[60:42] from Austria and then I live in Austria.
[60:44] So like there's zero uh dependency from
[60:48] Austria because I like literally no
[60:50] income at all from Austria. So I could
[60:52] live wherever I want to live and the
[60:55] question in my head of like do I move
[60:58] and where do I move? Those questions
[61:00] become bigger and bigger. I'm like why
[61:03] why am I here? And I still have some
[61:05] hope in politics because there are some
[61:07] things shifting. Uh but you're also
[61:09] wondering okay how much is it just
[61:12] to how much is it really changing and is
[61:15] it quick enough and would there be a
[61:18] different part of the world that might
[61:19] be be better placed? There's a lot of
[61:22] interesting game theory things currently
[61:25] going on in the world and it's so so
[61:27] interesting to watch. I'm predicting a
[61:29] happy ending for for you guys. I I think
[61:31] it there'll be a you know, Germany might
[61:34] not make it, but the Germans will be
[61:36] fine. The Germans were fine before
[61:38] Bismar without a country. You know,
[61:40] people don't realize Germany is a brand
[61:42] new country. It's not like this thing
[61:44] that's been around forever. It's not
[61:46] even close. It's not It's a brand new
[61:47] thing, right? It was literally created
[61:49] just a few years ago. Um, and Germans
[61:52] knew how to organize themselves without
[61:54] nation states for a long time. In fact,
[61:55] it was its wealthiest, most prosperous
[61:58] time. And you know, my my family is from
[62:00] Batten Vutenberg. Uh, so just on the
[62:03] French border uh near Fryborg and and
[62:06] Switzerland. And you know, I go I've
[62:09] been back I've been in your country,
[62:10] Insbrook. I've gone skiing there. And
[62:12] I've been around Salsburg and Vienna.
[62:15] And uh I I I look I I I lament people
[62:19] leaving Europe. Uh I don't blame them
[62:21] for leaving, but I think the fight is
[62:24] worth keeping up. You know, I I keep a
[62:27] place in Quebec and and I'm fighting for
[62:29] Quebec sovereignty now. Uh I do believe
[62:32] Quebec will be sovereign and successful
[62:34] as a sovereign state. Quebec will not be
[62:36] joining the United States. Uh as pro
[62:38] America as I am, Quebec just doesn't
[62:40] need it. They've got ports. They've got
[62:41] everything they need. uh they can easily
[62:44] be a country and and a nation without
[62:46] much trouble. Uh and it's a coherent
[62:48] place. There's a people that share the
[62:50] land and and sort of get it right. I
[62:52] think I think it's the tribal people who
[62:54] get the land, people who understand it
[62:56] are all your all that's going to be
[62:58] available to people to go forward. Uh
[63:01] there won't be much left to build on top
[63:03] of. And Europe has enough of that. I I
[63:05] think there's enough of that in France.
[63:06] There's enough of that in Germany.
[63:08] Certainly enough of that in Austria. I
[63:11] think Austrians have been uh have a long
[63:13] history of being, you know, a mountain
[63:16] community, right? A mountain community.
[63:18] And before there were nations, it was a
[63:19] bunch of people who occupied a certain
[63:21] mountain range and did very well from
[63:23] their mountain range. And uh um I
[63:27] imagine the happy ending there will be
[63:30] based on indeed the beauty. I agree. I I
[63:33] I go to Europe just to enjoy it. I don't
[63:35] you can't get anything done there. where
[63:37] I just go to eat and have fun and enjoy
[63:40] how beautiful it is. You want it to be I
[63:42] mean the last time I lived in Europe was
[63:45] when the market pumped in 2017. Uh my
[63:48] wife and I went out to make a baby. uh
[63:50] we said you know what let's go and hang
[63:52] out in Europe for a few months and and
[63:54] get pregnant for the first time and uh
[63:56] we lived in um on in the south of France
[64:01] uh near the Italian border and uh again
[64:05] it was lonesome like I said at the
[64:07] beginning because there were no
[64:08] Bitcoiners around with whom I could
[64:10] speak and there was a ton of Bitcoin
[64:11] news I could go to Monaco and try and
[64:13] sell people there on Bitcoin at the time
[64:14] which is what I was doing uh just
[64:17] private you know what is Bitcoin type of
[64:19] things and um you know that that was
[64:22] okay. But this idea that the European
[64:26] people have they're a little behind on
[64:28] what's going on in America, but I think
[64:30] they can catch up real quick. And once
[64:32] it catches on that again being its wants
[64:35] and fears and desires, right? Europe
[64:38] doesn't fear enough the problems of not
[64:41] stacking Bitcoin and doesn't want enough
[64:44] the advantages of stacking Bitcoin. Uh
[64:47] but it's coming real quick. there'll be
[64:49] no way around it because the appetite to
[64:51] keep Europe together will be as much
[64:53] pain and poverty as they're willing to
[64:55] stomach. And I don't think there's going
[64:56] to be a lot of appetite for pain and
[64:57] poverty. Uh they've shown a unique
[64:59] appetite so far. They surprise me on how
[65:02] much they can actually absorb in pain
[65:04] and poverty. Uh I I wouldn't have even
[65:06] given them this high, but there's
[65:09] probably a little ways to go still, but
[65:11] eventually when you look at just how
[65:13] ugly, you know, it's the ugliness,
[65:15] right? the ugliness and despair of some
[65:17] of the towns uh that shouldn't be there.
[65:20] Do you also think that the EU itself
[65:22] will completely um fall apart? And yeah,
[65:25] when the money is gone, now that now
[65:27] that Trump has a new buyer for T bills
[65:29] and doesn't require currency
[65:31] manipulators anymore, the Triffin
[65:34] dilemma is basically over. And the
[65:36] Triffven dilemma, you know, many people
[65:38] understand, but it's it's more or less
[65:40] that the security guarantees given to
[65:42] Europe and Japan came with an extra
[65:45] bonus that you could also buy uh US
[65:48] Treasury, US debt, which is what created
[65:51] this financial engineer archetype in
[65:53] America in the first place as the
[65:54] highest earner and that's what hollowed
[65:57] out our bluecollar manufacturing base
[66:00] over the years.
[66:02] So America's recalibrating this and with
[66:04] the stable coin guys, right? We know
[66:06] with Paulo uh guy living not far from
[66:09] you and in Austria over in Logano,
[66:13] Switzerland, uh these Tether folks have
[66:16] literally created a new apparatus. They
[66:18] own more T bills than Germany now.
[66:20] They're bigger currency manipulators
[66:21] than Germany. And so you're going to see
[66:24] more and more of the decentralization of
[66:27] the US debt to individuals around the
[66:29] world through things like uh um um
[66:33] stable coins. I think stable coins are
[66:35] about to go through the roof. Absolutely
[66:37] through the roof in terms of volume
[66:38] because this is bialism. Betalism is
[66:41] stable coin US fiat plus um the the the
[66:46] Bitcoin. So eventually Europe is going
[66:49] to get a taste of what's coming to
[66:51] Canada. It's going to become a
[66:52] speculative attack target. There aren't
[66:54] enough reserves. There's no one who's
[66:56] going to come save them. There's no one
[66:57] who's coming to help you. China, let
[67:00] them print you some money and see how
[67:02] that goes, right? You're not going to
[67:03] like it. It's not going to fit. And so
[67:06] eventually, the thing that keeps this
[67:08] together is the fake money. And when the
[67:11] fake money runs out, it's going to
[67:13] become completely altered. I think
[67:15] you're going to get a fiat type
[67:18] coalition of exactly those political
[67:21] lines I just drew for you, right? I
[67:23] think France joins the Latin places. So
[67:25] it it it leaves its sort of Germanic
[67:29] connection behind for the sake of
[67:32] dominating in fiat terms Italy and Spain
[67:35] and they create a nice little southern
[67:38] union. I think the northern guys create
[67:40] their own northern union and start um
[67:44] using currency to their advantage that
[67:45] they can create um that that will be
[67:48] believable, right? It's about what's
[67:50] believable and and so I I do see it
[67:53] dividing right along those lines. There
[67:54] will be new forms of money that come out
[67:56] of this in order to pay for the
[67:57] European. We the last thing we want as
[67:59] Bitcoiners, too. Like I'm a big UBI guy.
[68:01] I'm actually the Bitcoiner who loves
[68:03] UBI. I really do. And I make the case
[68:06] all the time is that we're not Most of
[68:08] these sludge people are [ __ ] There
[68:10] there's no helping them. They're not
[68:12] Some of these people will have such big
[68:13] cognitive dissonance from Bitcoin that
[68:15] the rest of their lives are going to be
[68:17] spent bitter, angry,
[68:20] um, you know, angry they they believed
[68:22] in credentialism so much. Angry they
[68:24] believed their university degree was
[68:26] worth something. Angry that they
[68:28] believed in all. I saw that the
[68:29] Europeans are now they're going to go
[68:31] attract American academics. That's their
[68:33] big plan. We're going to get all the
[68:35] smart Americans. They're not the smart
[68:37] ones. Let me tell you, they're our most
[68:39] [ __ ] population. Take them all. You
[68:41] can have every one of them. And so the
[68:44] the the
[68:46] the change is going to come financially
[68:49] in Europe. And it can come real quick
[68:53] and it will be a return to the more
[68:56] feudal roots of Europe where you do have
[68:58] this great land, you do have this great
[69:00] fertility, you do have this great
[69:02] capacity to produce things that are
[69:03] worth a lot of money. I mean, I would
[69:05] pay a lot of money for
[69:08] delicious German foods, right? I mean,
[69:11] the the the kitchen uh where I come from
[69:15] in that part of Germany on the French
[69:17] border is amazing. It's just amazing
[69:19] food and amazing abundance and they've
[69:22] got the wines from there and the white
[69:24] wines and it's near Champagne and all
[69:26] these great places. So Europe has still
[69:29] a ton of stuff to offer and a great
[69:32] human capital that's there. And so I I I
[69:35] think it can get out of this. I think it
[69:37] I really do. You you give me a lot of
[69:40] hope. I like that. Thank you so much.
[69:41] Great. It's going to be great, man. It's
[69:43] going to be great. Now, it might go a
[69:45] little shittier for a little longer, but
[69:48] um the the answers are there. And
[69:50] indeed, once, you know, Canada's going
[69:52] to set the tone here. I think bit I
[69:54] think the first country wiped out by
[69:56] Bitcoin is Canada. And once Bitcoiners
[70:00] understand that they can do this, the
[70:01] only shot they can't take is countries
[70:03] that have Bitcoin on the balance sheet,
[70:05] right? That won't work. They're not
[70:06] going to be able to hit America. It
[70:08] won't it it won't make sense. America
[70:10] can buy Bitcoin faster than the
[70:11] Bitcoiners can short the US dollar. And
[70:14] remember, the Bitcoin is being held with
[70:16] the Treasury, right? So even if the
[70:18] Federal Reserve gets into trouble, the
[70:19] the Treasury is there and the Treasury
[70:21] holds the Bitcoin. And so El Salvador,
[70:24] are you going to short El Salvador? How
[70:25] are you going to It's the US dollar plus
[70:27] the the Bitcoin, right? So that's not
[70:29] going to work either. But these guys can
[70:31] go and attack other countries and they
[70:33] will. Uh because the Canadian dollar is
[70:35] a sitting duck and ain't nobody going to
[70:38] help it this time. There's no Maybe
[70:40] Europe can try, but that's just going to
[70:42] get the attention of the degenerate
[70:43] Bitcoiners onto Europe. Okay, you want
[70:45] to waste money bailing Canada out. I got
[70:47] bad news for you, European Union. The
[70:50] ADIQ plebs out there are thirsty and
[70:53] they want to make money and they're
[70:55] going to [ __ ] you and they're going to
[70:58] do it again and again and again. They're
[71:00] all in Nigeria and China and America and
[71:05] they're going to have it's going to be
[71:06] fun. It's literally going to be fun. to
[71:09] wipe out the European the Euro, right?
[71:13] So, I can see this stuff perpetuating
[71:16] and that will be the end of the European
[71:18] Union when they can't when the because
[71:20] the bank was first. Remember, it was
[71:22] created around the bank. The point was
[71:24] the bank and then they grafted on the
[71:26] legislative apparatus on top. Uh the
[71:29] bank was the original piece to the
[71:32] European Union. The plans to go to the
[71:34] Euro, the plans to have the free trade
[71:35] zone, the plans to have all this. This
[71:37] is how the European Union grew into what
[71:39] it is today. It started as a banking
[71:41] relationship, a banking agreement. And
[71:44] that's what led to the 2001 transfer
[71:47] from the end of local fiat to the
[71:50] European uh uh money. So the the fakest
[71:55] money in the world, none of the pictures
[71:57] are real. The whole thing is an
[71:58] abomination, right? Like when you look
[71:59] at a euro, none of those things are real
[72:02] things. None of the windows, none of the
[72:04] doors, none of the arches. They're not
[72:06] even real places. The money, even the
[72:08] pictures on the money are fake. And so
[72:12] this is a a likely candidate for a
[72:15] Bitcoin knockout punch by global
[72:17] degenerate
[72:18] Bitcoiners that just want to make a
[72:20] little money. And what are you going to
[72:21] say about it? Nothing. Nothing can be
[72:23] done. They can scream and cry and kick
[72:25] walls and huff and puff. Not one of
[72:28] their degrees is going to help them. Not
[72:30] one of their insights is going to help
[72:32] them. Doesn't matter how well they dress
[72:34] or the scarves they wear around their
[72:36] neck. Uh how much they make fun of
[72:39] American bluecollar adiq plebs and how
[72:42] stupid Americans are. None of that is
[72:45] going to help. There is a train filled
[72:48] with reality coming to dump [ __ ] all
[72:51] over Europe and they're going to have to
[72:53] clean it up and they're not going to be
[72:56] able to. So the repercussions are it's
[72:58] gone. And when there's no when you can't
[73:01] follow the money anymore, when there is
[73:03] no money, there's nothing holding it
[73:05] together. It's like Canada. Canada is
[73:06] held together by the banking
[73:07] relationships between the states. Once
[73:10] those are gone, there's no more senue.
[73:12] There's no reason to stay together. And
[73:15] Canada was literally created to
[73:17] centralized banking. So Canada was
[73:19] created as a result of the US civil war.
[73:22] And when the Civil War ended, London
[73:25] with all of its money looked at Canada
[73:26] and said, "We're not actually going to
[73:28] give you money anymore because the
[73:29] Americans are just going to take
[73:30] whatever we built. We can't fight them
[73:32] again. They're crazy. They invented all
[73:33] these weapons. Like, they kill each
[73:35] other wholesale. America's really good
[73:37] at killing. Like, it's our number one
[73:39] industry. We're amazing at it." Like,
[73:41] there's no better country at killing
[73:43] people ever. There's never been a better
[73:45] country than that. It's it's an amazing
[73:47] sport in America, right? We're just the
[73:48] best ever. ever at all of it. So London
[73:53] looked in 1860s and said, "You're on
[73:56] your own, Canada. America can come take
[73:58] whatever they want. We're not going to
[74:00] defend you. We're not doing round
[74:01] three." They'd already gone twice
[74:02] against America in the Revolutionary War
[74:04] and in 1812 and said, "You're done." So
[74:08] Canada had just enough money left
[74:11] without any more English help to realize
[74:13] they needed to beat East West
[74:15] infrastructure. They need to build east
[74:16] to west to avoid American infrastructure
[74:19] coming up in the middle. There was such
[74:20] a thing as British Columbia and Eastern
[74:22] Canada as British colonies at the time,
[74:26] but there was nothing in the middle. So
[74:28] it was a race to claim the middle ranch
[74:29] land and all that. They didn't know
[74:31] anything about oil yet, but that was
[74:33] that was the race. And so Canada was all
[74:36] the money. That's why Canadian
[74:37] federalism is almost an exact copy of
[74:39] American federalism except for the
[74:41] banking. The banking was centralized
[74:43] from the very beginning. And that is why
[74:47] that is how the country was bound
[74:48] together. It was money flowing to build
[74:51] train lines and to build stuff east
[74:53] west. Which is why not building the
[74:55] pipelines and Trump building the north
[74:57] south pipeline for Keystone is the end
[74:59] of Canada. It can't survive that. Canada
[75:01] was invented to
[75:03] prevent north south infrastructure to
[75:05] extract resources from Canada down to
[75:07] America. That's the point. And so
[75:10] they've forgotten it because they're
[75:11] full of fiat. They think they are rich
[75:13] people on Bay Bay Street is the Wall
[75:15] Street of Canada. They don't understand
[75:17] what happened, right? They think their
[75:19] banks are untouchable. They're not
[75:20] untouchable. They're going down. And
[75:23] once you attack the money, there'll be
[75:25] nothing left keeping that place
[75:26] together. Quebec will have to double
[75:28] down on what it is. Quebec's an energy
[75:30] superpower. They've got a [ __ ] ton of
[75:32] extra energy. They're going to have to
[75:34] go full Bitcoin, and that'll happen
[75:37] across the land. Canada's rich and
[75:39] competent and they'll apply those two
[75:42] abilities just like Europe. Rich and
[75:44] competent, right? You have a lot in
[75:45] Europe nevertheless. Despite the
[75:47] trouble, you know how to build a nuclear
[75:49] reactor, right? You're never going to
[75:51] run out of stuff. You could build
[75:52] nuclear reactors. And if the country's
[75:54] in war footing, just look at what
[75:56] Germany did to build the liquid natural
[75:58] gas stuff. I mean, that was a huge
[75:59] engineering project when the Russian war
[76:01] started. They got it done like that,
[76:03] right? So, there's a capacity to do
[76:04] these things that will never go away, I
[76:07] don't think. and that they can mobilize
[76:09] in a war effort type thing to make up
[76:12] for the lack of the banking and the
[76:14] fancy people with the degrees. I I love
[76:16] that so much. Uh it's it's really
[76:18] interesting to to hear those things. I
[76:21] have one question to ask each and every
[76:22] one of my guests and the question is
[76:24] what can we learn from you besides
[76:26] Bitcoin? Well, I do a lot of uh is it
[76:29] besides Bitcoin? I I do a lot of sci-fi
[76:31] books. Uh it's kind of related to
[76:33] Bitcoin, but I write Bitcoin sci-fi
[76:35] stuff. So, have a look.
[76:37] really nice. I like sci-fi. That that's
[76:40] basically the the most interesting
[76:41] question always like how Bitcoin impacts
[76:44] the future and and and that's that's
[76:47] usually sci-fi books. So I've got one
[76:49] called Satoshi Wedding
[76:51] Murders. Um that's a pretty good one.
[76:53] I've got one called The Blue Moon Orange
[76:55] Coin. That's a pretty fun one, too. Uh
[76:58] so we write a lot of books, you know. I
[77:00] I can't Bitcoin's taken over my life.
[77:02] It's a mind virus. So I I don't know if
[77:04] I I don't know what I have nothing to
[77:07] talk about outside of Bitcoin. I don't
[77:08] know what else there is there. This is
[77:10] so interesting because actually like
[77:12] it's it's sometimes really funny like
[77:14] people that are uh speaking 1 hour, one
[77:17] and a half hours so good about Bitcoin
[77:19] and then I was like oh like what's
[77:20] besides Bitcoin? And then they're like
[77:22] one minute like uh uh I I don't know
[77:24] like what can you learn from me besides
[77:26] Bitcoin? Is there life outside of
[77:28] Bitcoin? I don't think there is. uh you
[77:31] know I I I would try to do you know I
[77:34] like Korea and Japan a lot uh I lived
[77:37] there
[77:38] before uh Bitcoin but they became
[77:41] Bitcoin countries so they're like
[77:42] Bitcoin capitals of the world now as
[77:44] well. So uh I started going over there a
[77:47] lot and even that took over like my
[77:49] whole association with the places are
[77:50] now just Bitcoin too. So uh Bitcoin is a
[77:54] operating system for you to look at the
[77:56] world. So I I I don't run a separate
[77:58] operating system anymore. You know, I've
[78:00] removed nationalism. I've removed all
[78:03] that stuff from my worldview. It just
[78:04] doesn't exist. That that's how I can be
[78:06] unscentimental, let's say, about Canada.
[78:08] Um I think it's all going to work out in
[78:10] the end for them.
[78:12] But I mean, as a Bitcoiner, it's more
[78:15] like I told you so than it is like, oh,
[78:18] save the country. Oh, you know, I I I
[78:21] get that. Um, we have entertaining the
[78:23] podcast where the previous guest is
[78:24] asking a question for the next guest
[78:26] without knowing who the next guest is.
[78:28] And with my previous guest, uh, Noah
[78:30] Kman and I discussed yesterday a lot
[78:33] around the idea, um, where Bitcoin
[78:36] brings us and if Bitcoin might even
[78:39] bring a moneyless society, an abundant
[78:42] uh, society where there's not even the
[78:44] concept of money on keeping scores. and
[78:46] he asked logically the question if
[78:49] Bitcoin and no money didn't exist at
[78:52] all. So like there's no money, there's
[78:53] no Bitcoin, there's nothing. Um how
[78:55] would your life be different? Uh mine
[78:58] I'd be doing exactly this. I'd be
[79:00] writing stories and living in beautiful
[79:03] places, chasing the sun around. And uh
[79:07] all of my homes are sunrise, sun
[79:10] optimized, so I only get tremendous
[79:12] amounts of sun. I spend actually most of
[79:15] my time just being a dad. I mean that's
[79:17] my number one activity. So uh I think
[79:20] it'd be the same and I'm glad. So I you
[79:22] know Satoshi Wedding Murders is actually
[79:24] about a world without money. Believe it
[79:27] or not there there Bitcoin is in it
[79:29] because the only market left in the
[79:31] world in my story is time for money
[79:33] where you spend your time and there's
[79:35] there's basically no countries anymore.
[79:37] What there are is Bitcoin liquidity and
[79:40] there that means there's a lot of ways
[79:42] to spend your time for Bitcoin in a
[79:44] place or other and a Satoshi wedding is
[79:46] because there are huge Bitcoin holding
[79:48] families but the way royalty used to
[79:50] hold laws and kind of confidence for the
[79:53] people in this future state royalty
[79:56] holds Bitcoin and confidence for people
[79:59] in the sense that it comes in and out of
[80:01] their accounts in a way but really what
[80:04] we have in the story is everyone has an
[80:06] eyeball like an AI ball, literally an
[80:09] eyeball, and your eyeball sort of spends
[80:11] your life with you, but it's also your
[80:12] Bitcoin wallet. And it scales Bitcoin
[80:14] cognitively, so it doesn't actually
[80:16] transact that much anymore. It sort of
[80:18] keeps off books, ledgers amongst
[80:20] themselves that help it understand who
[80:22] owes what where. And so it never really
[80:25] transacts anymore. Um, just every region
[80:28] is trying to get you to spend time there
[80:29] to keep a hot time market. Um, but a
[80:33] Satoshi wedding is when there's actual
[80:35] Bitcoin transactions because now the
[80:37] Bitcoin is all like rhymes. It's it's
[80:39] like locked up big time because the AI
[80:42] can't look at the public key less to it
[80:44] derive the private key. So, it's got to
[80:46] like leave it in a sort of quantum
[80:49] state. So what happens is the a Satoshi
[80:52] wedding is when you to consummate a
[80:54] Satoshi wedding, a Satoshi marriage, you
[80:57] have to have a Bitcoin transaction and
[80:59] you go into private to consummate the
[81:02] marriage by joining the wallets. And
[81:05] this is just a fun murder mystery where
[81:06] the story starts and the bride and groom
[81:09] are dead. And what happened is the
[81:10] eyeballs weren't in the room. Now
[81:12] there's only like 10 murders on Earth a
[81:14] year by this point. And each of them are
[81:16] solved immediately because the eyeballs
[81:17] will just subpoena what everything was
[81:18] seen around and the detective comes and
[81:21] it's kind of like, you know, they just
[81:22] catch the guy right away. And so in this
[81:25] story, the Satoshi wedding takes place.
[81:29] Uh the the bride and groom are dead, but
[81:32] there's no eyeball witness. There's no
[81:34] AI witness. So, it's just a follow the
[81:36] money murder mystery story of like why
[81:37] the person did it. They don't really
[81:39] remember how to solve crimes either.
[81:41] They're like, "How do we do this? It has
[81:42] been so long. we've gotten lazy. Uh so
[81:45] indeed that's that's the world I predict
[81:47] that there is no money. There's just a
[81:49] way place to spend time. The time is all
[81:52] offset by bitcoin liquidity and these
[81:56] huge Bitcoin hubs are where everyone
[81:58] wants to spend their time. Um because
[82:01] you do get a bit of Bitcoin for making
[82:03] things, you know, friendly. Friendly.
[82:07] Awesome. Thank you so much, Nolan, for
[82:09] for for being such an amazing guest
[82:12] today. Um, before I let you go, where
[82:14] can people find you, ask you questions,
[82:15] and reach out to you? Um, you can find
[82:17] me on Twitter, Count BTC. You can see my
[82:20] daily show. Uh, I think it's again I
[82:22] think it's timed the same time as yours.
[82:23] I didn't realize that. I checked your uh
[82:25] your YouTube today and it says 8 am
[82:27] Eastern time. So, I do a daily show also
[82:29] at 8 a.m. Eastern time. So, uh we're uh
[82:32] we're on top of each other. Uh mine's
[82:35] live. It's generally just me. Uh I had
[82:38] my first guest ever after three or four
[82:40] years yesterday. Uh, I had Prince
[82:42] Phillip of Serbia on the show yesterday.
[82:45] I had Pete Rizzo on this morning just
[82:47] because I'm testing out uh guests in the
[82:49] morning from time to time. Um, other
[82:51] than that, you'll find me on Roxom TV. I
[82:54] am uh one of the main hosts of
[82:55] everything on Roxom TV. Roxom TV is
[82:57] associated with Roxom, which is the
[82:59] Bitcoin denominated exchange. Everything
[83:01] in the world measured by Bitcoin. We
[83:03] have no trash tokens in the platform.
[83:06] It's just Bitcoin versus everything.
[83:08] That way you can measure Apple stock or
[83:09] Tesla stock against Bitcoin and you can
[83:11] measure oil and whatever else against
[83:14] Bitcoin. It's an everything in the world
[83:16] exchange denominated in Bitcoin. It's a
[83:18] Bitcoin worldview platform and I'm out
[83:21] there building new shows which is uh
[83:23] something we should chat about. Uh we
[83:25] have some distribution thing. That's
[83:26] what I wanted to chat at the end of our
[83:27] podcast. So when we break here I'll have
[83:29] a quick chat with you. Perfect. Thank
[83:32] you so much uh Nolan for being on. Also,
[83:34] thank you so much for everyone that is
[83:36] watching and listening for joining us
[83:37] today. As always, I'll be back tomorrow
[83:39] with another episode. Bye-bye.
