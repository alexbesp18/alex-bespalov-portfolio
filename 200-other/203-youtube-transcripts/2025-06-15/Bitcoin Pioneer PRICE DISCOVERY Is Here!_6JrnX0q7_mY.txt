[00:00] I set up one of the first 50 lightning
[00:01] nodes on the network I guess I made the
[00:03] third purchase for physical Goods with
[00:05] lightning when blockstream set up their
[00:07] store everybody's telling you it's dumb
[00:09] it's not going to work out the
[00:10] government's going to stop it but we
[00:12] believed in it and we we had this strong
[00:14] conviction that you know it's going to
[00:16] work out the price of Bitcoin went from
[00:18] under hundred to over $11,000 in like
[00:21] one or two days when something's making
[00:23] a new alltime high it's in price
[00:25] discovery mode I think there's going to
[00:26] be a moment when people are like I'm
[00:27] going to be left behind if I don't have
[00:30] Bitcoin thing that I love about Bitcoin
[00:32] is that it's Cipher Punk the cipher Punk
[00:34] idea is that we you change it with code
[00:36] without their approval Bitcoin should be
[00:37] strong enough to withstand any outside
[00:41] influence each person can download the
[00:43] whole blockchain all the transactions
[00:44] and verify that that information is
[00:46] correct without any third party I'm also
[00:48] bringing back frster frster the old
[00:50] social networking
[00:52] [Music]
[00:56] site I I I saw that you have been also
[00:59] pretty early in Bitcoin and enlightening
[01:01] for uh even uh pretty early um let's
[01:05] just started with like
[01:07] why what made you so early so bullish on
[01:11] bitcoin what did you see uh what like
[01:14] 99.999% of the world did not
[01:17] see yeah so yeah I mean I I I follow
[01:21] Hacker News um website and uh I remember
[01:25] like in
[01:27] 2011 uh around then you know people
[01:30] posting about Bitcoin and um you know I
[01:34] ignored the first few things just like
[01:37] skimmed over it and but then at like
[01:40] eventually one somebody posted and I was
[01:43] like well I've I've heard about this a
[01:45] few times on Hacker News maybe I should
[01:46] read this and and yeah I was right away
[01:51] I knew that this was
[01:53] like um kind of a revolutionary thing I
[01:57] mean it's grown over time as I got as
[01:59] I've gotten to know it more but you know
[02:01] at the beginning I was like whoa this is
[02:02] a revolutionary thing this uh solves a
[02:06] problem that's never been solved before
[02:08] um this could be this could be huge uh
[02:13] so I yeah I got into it and then um you
[02:17] know I wanted to buy some but at that
[02:19] time it was hard like there was no
[02:21] coinbase or any like that like you had
[02:24] to I remember um I think it was Charlie
[02:27] shem's uh website I forget what it what
[02:30] it's called but like you had to wire
[02:32] money you had to go to like Western un
[02:35] you had to Western Union some money and
[02:37] then once they got it you could get the
[02:40] uh you know I I set up an account and I
[02:42] was gonna do it but then I was like this
[02:44] is too much trouble and you know who it
[02:46] could be a scam it seems kind of weird
[02:48] like like I have to send money like that
[02:50] way so I didn't end up getting it um and
[02:54] but then you know later on I I got more
[02:57] into it and uh and uh yeah and then
[03:01] light when lightning came out you know
[03:02] that was another thing where I was like
[03:04] wow this is this is something that could
[03:06] be really cool um so the hacker in me
[03:11] you know was like I got to try this out
[03:12] I got to test it out and so you know I
[03:15] was on the IRC Channel like setting up a
[03:18] lightning node and yeah set up one of
[03:19] the first 50 lightning nodes on the
[03:21] network and um yeah I I guess I made the
[03:26] third P third purchase for physical
[03:28] Goods with lightning um when blockstream
[03:30] set up their store we selling stickers
[03:33] and stuff I I bought some so yeah nice
[03:37] what is or Wass Hacker News Hacker News
[03:40] is uh it's a it's a uh like a website
[03:44] where people can post articles and have
[03:46] discussions around different things that
[03:48] hackers are interested in and it's it's
[03:50] set up by y combinator um the investment
[03:53] firm who like who's invested in like
[03:56] Airbnb and coinbase and all those uh
[03:59] people yeah it's so it's a it's like a
[04:02] news site it's kind of like like a
[04:04] Reddit style thing uh but it's like
[04:07] focused around startups and and uh
[04:10] hacker stuff it's super fascinating for
[04:14] me because in the early days it seems
[04:15] like there were only like cyer buks it
[04:17] security people like uh the hacker
[04:20] people in Bitcoin and night in like all
[04:24] those black rock Larry fs and all those
[04:26] financial institutes come in so like it
[04:28] it it made quite a journey and it's just
[04:30] like a few like 10 years or something
[04:32] like that or 12 years uh where it made
[04:35] that uh small small Journey from like oh
[04:38] it's it's a really really really Niche
[04:41] thing where some uh minority of of
[04:45] people in the internet think it might be
[04:46] revolutionary but it's also really hard
[04:48] to get to like you can buy it literally
[04:51] in so many places especially if you live
[04:53] in America or Europe like it's super
[04:55] easy to get Bitcoin uh it it it made
[04:58] quite an made an story in yeah basically
[05:02] in one decade or one and a half decades
[05:04] if you take it from the from the early
[05:06] days uh really really interesting and
[05:08] you lived through that H how was how was
[05:11] the journey uh for you when you seen in
[05:13] the starting where you couldn't even
[05:15] really nicely buy Bitcoin and now you
[05:17] can have an ETF and the president is
[05:19] talking about
[05:20] it yeah it's crazy because it's like I
[05:23] mean if you know like the people who
[05:25] were in at the beginning were like you
[05:27] know everybody's telling you it's dumb
[05:30] it's not going to work out the
[05:31] government's going to stop it and you
[05:33] know but there's like but we believed in
[05:35] it and we like we had this strong
[05:37] conviction that you know it's going to
[05:39] work out and or that it you know it's
[05:41] worth that it's like a cool thing you
[05:43] know we didn't know it was going to work
[05:44] out but like we knew it was like this
[05:47] really cool revolutionary thing that has
[05:49] never been done before and so we just
[05:52] like uh yeah so it's like just really
[05:56] cool to work on and like be a part of
[05:58] and um
[06:00] but yeah I remember it's you know
[06:03] like uh it is interesting because well I
[06:07] remember the fir the first at least one
[06:09] I like Bull Run I was involved in I
[06:12] remember like
[06:14] clearly there was like one day one or
[06:16] two day it was like basically one or two
[06:18] days where it went from like uh the
[06:22] price of of Bitcoin went from like under
[06:24] a hundred to over ,000 dollar um in like
[06:28] one or two days and I remember watching
[06:30] that and I was like whoa wow this is
[06:32] insane like it it's like something you
[06:36] know people are this is definitely I
[06:40] don't know that to me was like this is
[06:44] some it's some it's getting legitimacy
[06:46] like this is serious legitimacy and then
[06:49] after that I was in the news and
[06:50] everything and like and honestly like
[06:53] after that people were like oh you're
[06:55] too late to bitcoin you know like you're
[06:56] too late like because it it went up to
[06:59] over th and then it was down to like two
[07:01] or 300 and people were like yeah
[07:04] Bitcoins it's it's over it's done and
[07:08] but yeah at that point that's what made
[07:11] me realize wow this actually could this
[07:13] is something that could actually like uh
[07:17] become legitimate thing I think but yes
[07:21] go ahead goe no I just want to point out
[07:24] because like from the the point from 100
[07:27] to a th000 is the same jump from 100,000
[07:30] to 1 million it's it's not the same
[07:33] because you need a lot more purchasing
[07:35] power to get from the one to the other
[07:36] one obviously uh is that something that
[07:41] you even think is possible again or was
[07:44] it just back then possible because it
[07:46] was such a small amount and such a small
[07:49] Mark cap Bo that uh the mission the
[07:52] point I want to get to is like is the
[07:55] the rule of diminishing returns true or
[07:58] are we in the
[08:00] small upscale thing where it's like now
[08:03] 3% and we could all of the sudden jump
[08:05] to really really high adoption like this
[08:07] uh gradually then suddenly moment um how
[08:11] do you look at uh that yeah I mean I
[08:14] think it's in you know it's in this
[08:15] price Discovery phase it's like we've
[08:17] never had this thing before like what's
[08:20] it worth and so you know like the
[08:23] Market's trying to figure that out and
[08:25] you know everybody has their U you know
[08:28] their their hypothesis of what it's
[08:30] worth and stuff uh but it hasn't we
[08:33] don't know yet it's still going up like
[08:34] people are the Market's still figuring
[08:36] it out and who knows where it will end
[08:39] up what it's what it's really worth I
[08:42] mean me from my perspective is I was a
[08:45] day trader for a while and I like I've
[08:48] studied charts and stuff and and Trends
[08:51] and I mean there's one quote that I
[08:53] really love from William O'Neal who's
[08:54] this investor uh who did like Investors
[08:57] Business Daily and stuff like that it he
[08:59] has this quote where it's like it's one
[09:01] of the great paradoxes of the stock
[09:03] market that what seems too high goes
[09:06] higher and what seems too low goes lower
[09:09] and I I I think that's true I've I mean
[09:12] that's one of the things I've done with
[09:14] my investing is like when something's
[09:17] making a new all-time high that's the
[09:18] time to buy and when something's like
[09:21] making a new all-time low like you have
[09:23] to have a good it's not like you have to
[09:25] have a good reason like fundamentally
[09:27] you like maybe Warren Buffett can do
[09:29] that stuff but for me it's more it's
[09:30] like when something's making a new
[09:32] all-time high it's in price discovery
[09:33] mode it's like we got to figure out what
[09:35] this is actually worth because we don't
[09:36] know and I think that's like the case
[09:39] with Bitcoin it's this revolutionary
[09:40] thing like we've it was a solved a
[09:42] problem that's never been solved before
[09:44] in human history it's like money for the
[09:46] internet uh so and it it's you know
[09:49] decentralized so yeah what is it worth
[09:52] and from my perspective I'm still
[09:54] waiting for I've been waiting for like
[09:56] from a Trader perspective I've I've been
[09:59] waiting
[10:00] for the moment when and I don't think
[10:03] it's happened yet when I think it will
[10:06] happen though because I don't I think
[10:07] there's going to be a moment when people
[10:09] are like I'm gonna be left behind if I
[10:11] don't have Bitcoin because there's still
[10:13] a lot of people who don't have like
[10:15] significant Bitcoin I think there's
[10:17] going to be a moment where people are
[10:19] they're gonna
[10:20] Panic they're goingon to Panic by
[10:22] because they're like I'm going to be
[10:24] left behind like I'm stuck with this
[10:27] Fiat which is like not worth
[10:30] not really worth much I'm going to be
[10:31] left behind and there's going to be a
[10:33] panic buying which I think could take it
[10:34] from like 100,000 to over a million who
[10:36] knows but I mean yeah who knows what's
[10:39] going to happen but I I do think I'm
[10:41] still waiting for that I mean it happens
[10:43] a little bit in the in every bull market
[10:45] there's like a panic buying thing but it
[10:48] hasn't happened where there's like you
[10:50] know your neighbors and stuff who have
[10:53] never been into Bitcoin are
[10:54] like we got to buy Bitcoin you know that
[10:58] I feel like that moment may it's I'm
[10:59] still waiting for that moment the moment
[11:02] where those bitcoiners that are known in
[11:04] their friend circles all of the sudden
[11:06] have like 20 30 text and Miss calls of
[11:08] like hey how can I buy Bitcoin what
[11:10] should I do yeah that moment I heard an
[11:13] amazing example yesterday actually on
[11:14] the podcast uh my guest um uh made an
[11:18] amazing example of exponential uh growth
[11:21] and he said the example was uh there's a
[11:24] football stadium and it is filled with
[11:26] water and in the first minute you add
[11:28] one drop of water in the second minute
[11:31] you add two drops of water and then in
[11:33] the third minute four and so on so like
[11:35] exponential growth of how how much water
[11:37] you give in and the and the football
[11:40] stadium is at
[11:42] 7% uh full at 45 minutes and it just
[11:46] takes another five minute to 100% uh
[11:49] fing the football stadium so like 45
[11:51] minutes it's 7% and then at 50 minutes
[11:54] it's at 100% And this is uh I think the
[11:58] human brain range just cannot comprehend
[12:00] exponential growth and something like
[12:04] Bitcoin is highly exponential especially
[12:07] because the supply is fixed it's I think
[12:10] we we we just cannot comprehend what
[12:12] this is because we cannot compare it to
[12:14] anything because there has never been
[12:16] anything close to what Bitcoin actually
[12:19] is yeah yeah I know the fix I know
[12:22] there's a lot of variables that make
[12:24] this I mean that make it I mean when I
[12:27] first got into it it's like solves this
[12:30] problem that's never been done before
[12:31] it's money backed by math it has a fixed
[12:34] Supply it's Global it's like Global
[12:36] money um and it's yeah money for the
[12:39] internet you can you it's money like you
[12:41] can like you can send an email and it's
[12:44] like you know send money like it's
[12:45] sending an email so yeah all those
[12:47] things combined make it this uh super
[12:51] valuable thing and that also you
[12:54] know in terms of like from an investment
[12:57] standpoint it's like those are types of
[12:59] Technology things like that can get
[13:01] insane hype too which uh can make it
[13:05] like yeah go go inane but um yeah
[13:10] absolutely yeah it it could go insane
[13:13] how do you look um before we come to to
[13:16] to maybe layer two things in your spaces
[13:19] um how do you look at the current uh
[13:21] developments obviously we are at the
[13:22] price like almost 100K but we also have
[13:24] this year the Haring we have this year
[13:27] Bitcoin ETFs we have this year president
[13:30] uh endorsing Bitcoin it seems like a
[13:32] crazy year and maybe it gets even
[13:34] crazier next year uh how do you like the
[13:36] the current developments I also hear a
[13:38] lot of people especially those who were
[13:40] early into Bitcoin that they don't like
[13:43] that there are now so many um
[13:45] traditional Financial people like Michel
[13:48] SAA I guess also is one uh and Larry
[13:51] think especially now coming into Bitcoin
[13:53] how do you look at those developments
[13:56] yeah I mean it's really interesting when
[13:59] the president you know is like talking
[14:01] and a lot of politicians are like we
[14:05] gotta adopt Bitcoin because like the
[14:09] thing that I love about Bitcoin is that
[14:11] it's Cipher Punk like it's um you know
[14:14] the whole idea was that you can't like
[14:18] it's it's way too slow to to get the
[14:21] politicians to change to like like it's
[14:23] impossible it's almost impossible to get
[14:25] them to change um like by calling them
[14:28] up writing letters like we should you
[14:30] know so the cipher Punk idea is that we
[14:33] like you change it with code like you
[14:34] write code to um and it changes things
[14:38] like without their approval like around
[14:40] them you know like around like it it it
[14:43] goes over their OBS the Obstacle of like
[14:46] all that bureaucracy and stuff and
[14:48] that's what I love about Bitcoin and
[14:50] Cipher Punk stuff so I I but it is
[14:54] interesting now it's almost like you
[14:57] know we we've kind of like
[14:59] one you know because it's like we went
[15:02] around and now they have to uh and it
[15:05] worked the cyberpunk thing worked and
[15:07] now they are backing it because of the
[15:10] popularity of it because because it
[15:12] worked so I mean but for me really the
[15:15] thing that I love most about it is the
[15:17] you know the um hacker aspect of it the
[15:19] cipher Punk aspect that you know I love
[15:22] how it works I love I think um you know
[15:25] all all of them getting involved it's
[15:28] probably really good from a price
[15:29] standpoint and I think it's good but you
[15:32] know really what it comes down to is I
[15:35] don't think it should
[15:36] matter you know because it's Bitcoin
[15:38] should be strong enough to
[15:42] withstand any of that like any outside
[15:45] influence like that so so I think it
[15:47] helps from you know a day-to-day
[15:49] standpoint like the legit legitimacy and
[15:52] the legality of using it um uh but but
[15:57] yeah I don't think it
[15:59] in some ways it's a little bit like an
[16:00] attack on bitcoin because people are
[16:03] some it's a large amounts are getting
[16:05] into hands of people who may want to try
[16:07] to control it so it's kind of a good
[16:09] test but it should I I'm I'm hopeful
[16:12] that it shouldn't really matter because
[16:15] Bitcoin should be able to withstand it
[16:17] and and continue absolutely yeah it it
[16:22] if it's if it's not it's strong enough
[16:23] to withstand that it it it it never was
[16:26] so I think we we are strong enough for
[16:28] that and
[16:29] it's it's exactly made for for being
[16:32] that money and uh it's always funny for
[16:35] me when I see people that uh like
[16:38] Bitcoin and like the narrative but they
[16:40] don't like when someone else adopts it
[16:42] just because they disagree with him so
[16:45] like Bitcoin is also for your enemies
[16:46] Bitcoin is for everyone uh not just your
[16:50] uh your friends and your like-minded
[16:52] group of people so like even the people
[16:55] that you disagree with they they can
[16:57] also have a piece of that Financial
[16:59] Revolution they will also have a piece
[17:01] of that Financial Revolution as as the
[17:03] rest of the world um speaking of the
[17:05] rest of the world is then also really
[17:07] interesting how we come from this small
[17:10] asset that grows always faster uh always
[17:14] bigger and then we need also Payment
[17:16] Solutions we need the all exciting
[17:18] things on top of Bitcoin the asset and
[17:21] the first thing that you also said you
[17:23] you made the third uh lightning
[17:26] transaction uh so you also were really
[17:28] uh quick to adopt layer technology with
[17:31] lightning um how how satisfied are you
[17:34] with with layer tools and the payment
[17:36] systems and uh yeah use cases on top of
[17:40] Bitcoin yeah I so I think bitcoin's you
[17:45] know and as I've as I've spent years
[17:48] like with Bitcoin and thinking about it
[17:50] and working with it and stuff um you
[17:53] know at first it was just money you know
[17:55] it's money but then I've come to realize
[17:58] I think money is super important the
[18:00] super important part of it but I've come
[18:02] to realize that the thing that's super
[18:06] valuable about Bitcoin is the is The
[18:08] Ledger the the block space um because
[18:11] it's it's this decentralized like Ledger
[18:14] it's this decentralized there's space on
[18:16] it there's space on this decentralized
[18:18] Ledger that's super secure and verified
[18:20] by all these nodes and you know backed
[18:23] by the power of all these Miners And so
[18:26] this space on the on the blockchain is
[18:28] so is really valuable and you pay for it
[18:30] with a fee you know like you can get it
[18:32] for a fee and so in my in my
[18:36] view money was the first killer app
[18:39] built on this block space like money is
[18:43] super important to society and it's a
[18:45] great use case for for that block space
[18:49] but I think there's other things that
[18:50] can be used for that block space uh I
[18:54] think it's like a I'm super excited and
[18:56] what I've been working on and building
[18:58] is is another use use case for that
[19:01] space so yeah I mean I could talk talk
[19:04] about that or it's it's it's it's
[19:07] interest um before we go go to
[19:11] spaces why is that block space so
[19:14] meaningful so you're seeing the the
[19:17] block space of Bitcoin kind of like uh
[19:20] something bigger than just money it's
[19:22] just like a it's almost like a Time
[19:25] chain where you can put things on there
[19:27] it's always there for for Humanity is is
[19:29] that where where we going with that yeah
[19:31] you can anchor things in the security of
[19:34] this uh of that block space so bitcoin's
[19:37] like by far the the most secure proof of
[19:40] work blockchain and so the space on it
[19:43] is super valuable uh because it's where
[19:47] you can yes store information without a
[19:50] third party um and you can verify that
[19:53] and uh like each person can download the
[19:56] whole blockchain all the transactions
[19:58] and verify that that information is
[19:59] correct without any third party and so
[20:02] that space is really useful and there's
[20:06] it it's right now the main use case and
[20:09] a very important one maybe the most
[20:10] important one is money and that's a
[20:13] great use case that's a great use of
[20:15] that space is a ledger for money to to
[20:18] not need a third party to uh to um you
[20:22] know verify transactions it's all and
[20:25] it's secured it's very secure but there
[20:27] I think there's other use cases for it I
[20:30] think there's like there's other
[20:32] important things in
[20:34] society that could use that that would
[20:36] not hurt uh the use case of money um so
[20:41] I think there's other things that can
[20:42] tap into that and use that space that
[20:45] doesn't that doesn't hurt the money use
[20:47] case and um that would be really
[20:50] valuable to
[20:53] society it's it's really interesting for
[20:55] me when when we look at that because I I
[20:57] think no matter what you do you cannot
[21:00] hurt the use case of money uh even if
[21:03] you like uh spam the Bitcoin blockchain
[21:06] like you pay for that you basically
[21:08] contribute to the security of Bitcoin uh
[21:11] so even if you spam it even if you put
[21:13] something on the blockchain that doesn't
[21:14] make sense in the beginning uh you still
[21:18] contribute to the to the to the Bitcoin
[21:21] uh security overall uh so I guess the
[21:24] block space is the representation of the
[21:27] free market uh if you can sustain
[21:30] something long term and there's block
[21:32] space for your project uh then uh it it
[21:36] kind of has a a legitimacy it has some
[21:40] something that that is good on on there
[21:42] at least that's how I see it um but I'm
[21:46] completely focused on the money part but
[21:48] yeah maybe there are some other use
[21:49] cases on that uh so tell me what are you
[21:52] doing with I think it's called spaces uh
[21:55] what is that and uh why why do we need
[21:58] it on on on on bitcoin and why not some
[22:01] somewhere else or I think the the right
[22:05] right now we're doing it with like uh
[22:08] normal providers of of domains right
[22:11] yeah yeah so just to give a little bit
[22:14] bit of background I you know I got into
[22:17] Bitcoin like 2013 and um and 20 in 2014
[22:22] I started a domain name company
[22:25] park.io uh which was a drop catching
[22:27] service for domain names and with that I
[22:31] uh managed three different I can
[22:34] accredited registar I worked with
[22:35] Registries like doio doai and then you
[22:40] know and all all that uh and um so I got
[22:44] really got to know the domain name
[22:45] industry and all the issues with it and
[22:49] so and you know tied with my Bitcoin
[22:52] interest I I realized like domain names
[22:55] should definitely be on a blockchain
[22:57] they're just digital assets asss uh
[22:59] there's no reason that they shouldn't be
[23:01] on a blockchain why should you need a
[23:03] third it's just like with money with
[23:04] banks why do you need a third party to
[23:06] tell you what you can do or why do you
[23:08] need to rely on a third party for your
[23:10] name for your name like you just should
[23:12] not it's absolutely not necessary and
[23:15] it's also a huge risk and it's an urgent
[23:17] need to get it on the blockchain because
[23:20] because um there's countless examples of
[23:22] like names being taken down domain names
[23:26] I mean I can give you a few examples
[23:28] like do cat the top level domain. cat
[23:31] cat for Catalonia they were the Spanish
[23:34] government didn't like what some people
[23:36] were posting on some of those domains so
[23:37] they raided the offices of doat and
[23:39] arrested the CTO for sedition and and
[23:42] they took down a lot of domains and
[23:45] that's just one example another example
[23:46] is like Squarespace there's a
[23:48] Squarespace hack a lot of crypto
[23:49] companies were forced to rely on a third
[23:52] party um for their name for their domain
[23:55] name and uh it was hacked and a lot of
[23:58] people lost money because of that and so
[24:01] and you know that's just domain names
[24:03] there's there's also things with freedom
[24:05] of speech with domain names so people
[24:08] you know if somebody posts something
[24:10] that somebody else doesn't approve of
[24:12] they can take it down or uh also just
[24:14] usernames too like people have their for
[24:17] example Twitter name taken away or you
[24:20] know on various other social networking
[24:23] sites or stuff their usernames are taken
[24:25] away so yeah so anyway it's I I realize
[24:29] like there's no need for this I mean
[24:32] another example is like when you encrypt
[24:34] when you encrypt a website with
[24:36] https you know you it's encrypted but
[24:39] for your domain name you have to re rely
[24:41] on a third party certificate Authority
[24:43] so it's it's signed with somebody else's
[24:45] Keys you know so and there's no need for
[24:48] that and it's a security risk so uh
[24:52] there's this urgent need and also
[24:54] Bitcoin is relying on domains in some
[24:56] cases you know like there's 353 Matt
[24:59] Caro put a uh for human readable wallet
[25:02] address names and in it he has a really
[25:05] good you know he he really thought about
[25:07] it and talked about it and he was like
[25:08] you know it'd be better if it was
[25:09] there's a decentralized solution but we
[25:11] don't want to have to rely on like a
[25:13] another blockchain like ethereum for ens
[25:16] or something so the best solution that
[25:18] he came up with but he realized it
[25:19] wasn't ideal is that you know DNS but
[25:23] you know if if somebody's getting I mean
[25:26] trust me I know from a from managing
[25:28] domain registrars it's like if
[25:30] somebody's getting a lot of uh payment
[25:33] to a to a wallet address that's just
[25:36] tied to DNS like there's lots of people
[25:39] who could uh change that besides the
[25:42] owner of the domain name and also a lot
[25:45] of companies you rely on are not secure
[25:48] enough to to rely on that like so yeah
[25:50] it should just be it's important it's an
[25:52] urgent need to to uh have your name you
[25:55] should just be able to own your name and
[25:57] not have to rely on anybody else or ask
[25:58] permission for anybody else and so
[26:01] that's what motivated uh me to start
[26:03] this other company
[26:05] impervious and at first impervious was
[26:07] working on um other decentralized naming
[26:10] systems like ens and handshake uh but
[26:14] we've we came to realize that Bitcoin is
[26:17] by far the most secure proof of work
[26:21] blockchain it should be anchored in
[26:23] Bitcoin a decentralized naming system
[26:26] should be anchored in Bitcoin and so
[26:29] and so we decided we we worked for like
[26:30] the last two years um working on this
[26:34] new protocol the spaces protocol which
[26:36] you can find at spaces protocol. org and
[26:39] uh it's it's a protocol built on bitcoin
[26:42] and it has Cipher Punk ideals we have no
[26:45] separate token no separate blockchain no
[26:48] Foundation um we we made sure that it's
[26:52] super Cipher Punk and also we kept in
[26:54] mind that even though we're anchoring it
[26:56] in Bitcoin we're using using the block
[26:59] space uh we wanted to leave a light
[27:02] footprint you know so it doesn't it
[27:03] doesn't you know it doesn't fill up the
[27:06] block space with large amounts of data
[27:09] it's we we we build it really efficient
[27:12] so that it has a light
[27:15] foot how how is this um working there's
[27:19] there's aot a lot of question mark in my
[27:21] head obviously uh on that but I'm also
[27:23] not the the most technical person um I
[27:27] in will ask myself a lot like how do we
[27:30] decentralize so many problems that we
[27:32] have we have like money when we can
[27:34] decentralize that we have a big problem
[27:36] solved and we have communication like
[27:38] with Twitter and and YouTube that seems
[27:41] to be Nostra right now the the the main
[27:45] one how we can decentralize that um how
[27:48] is the spaces protocol can I think about
[27:51] that more than more as a lightning
[27:53] protocol or is it more like a Noster
[27:55] protocol how how does that from
[27:58] technical standpoint uh work yeah so
[28:01] first it's uh we we designed it to scale
[28:05] so there's two different levels uh two
[28:07] different layers so it's similar to how
[28:09] traditional domains work there's like
[28:11] with traditional domains there's a top
[28:13] level domain like do or doio or.org and
[28:17] then there's second level under that
[28:18] like google.com or whatever or Bitcoin
[28:21] bitcoin.org so so with spaces there's
[28:23] top level spaces which are on the
[28:26] Bitcoin blockchain that that's the part
[28:28] that's stored on the blockchain itself
[28:30] the name it's and uh and then we also
[28:33] have we designed a way to have second
[28:36] level uh spaces so for example um right
[28:41] now actually the the name Bitcoin is in
[28:44] auction on the spaces protocol and so
[28:47] let's say you get that you you have at
[28:49] Bitcoin so you have the top level you
[28:51] win the auction and you get the top
[28:53] level uh space at Bitcoin so then you
[28:56] could um you could sell or giveaway or
[28:59] whatever second level spaces underneath
[29:01] of that so like you could sell me Mike
[29:04] at at Bitcoin and um we have a system to
[29:08] do that with uh zero knowledge proofs so
[29:11] that basically I would own Mike at
[29:14] Bitcoin completely like and uh you would
[29:17] not have any control over it and so I
[29:20] could use that I could use my at Bitcoin
[29:22] um in a completely decentralized way and
[29:24] it's secured by it's secured by Bitcoin
[29:28] and so I could use like Mike at Bitcoin
[29:30] for like for example with bip 353 for
[29:33] wallet payment address like you could
[29:35] send me Bitcoin at Mike at Bitcoin or I
[29:38] could use it for a Noster username like
[29:42] instead of like publishing my npub key
[29:45] you know to Twitter and be like follow
[29:47] me here this big long string that you
[29:49] have to copy and paste and you there's
[29:51] no way you could remember that instead I
[29:53] could say oh yeah follow me on Noster at
[29:55] mic Bitcoin and for example you you
[29:58] could you know uh resolve like a web
[30:01] page at Mike at Bitcoin and it could be
[30:03] secured with https with no third party
[30:06] in between it' be you know encrypted
[30:09] signed by my keys and stuff so so yeah
[30:12] those are the those are the some of the
[30:14] use cases for so you could also put that
[30:18] in a normal browser like a chrome or
[30:21] Safar uh and and get to to the page or
[30:25] do you have to get a a special process
[30:28] for that yeah right now we don't have
[30:29] the integration built in so um but yeah
[30:33] in the future we would like to um I
[30:36] don't know if it'd be a plug-in or
[30:38] something you know or we have we do have
[30:40] actually have our own browser which we
[30:42] built to resolve e domains with DNS we
[30:46] it was the first we we actually made the
[30:48] first browser that can resolve um
[30:52] websites with https without relying on a
[30:55] third party certificate Authority it
[30:57] uses this system called Dane so that it
[31:00] it's uh completely encrypted without
[31:03] third party certificate Authority so we
[31:04] do have our own browser that we can
[31:06] integrate it into um but we may also
[31:10] like uh add like a Plugin or something
[31:13] um and it could uh and it could verify
[31:17] you know it could verify the name and
[31:19] resolve it um quickly and it's and it's
[31:25] verified and it's verified and it's back
[31:28] by Bitcoin the pro you know so like the
[31:31] cool thing about one cool thing is like
[31:33] with ens with like eth it's super hard
[31:36] to sync a node like a full node to
[31:39] verify all the transactions there's so
[31:41] much data but with Bitcoin it's you know
[31:44] something that you could so you could
[31:45] resolve these with like a Raspberry Pi
[31:47] or something like that so it's it's uh
[31:50] more scalable I partnered up with coin
[31:54] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[31:57] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[31:59] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[32:02] love it so much coin vigilante made a
[32:05] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[32:08] subtle elegant way to go out there and
[32:11] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[32:13] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[32:17] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[32:20] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[32:23] watch collections you have the date of
[32:25] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[32:29] there and of course also the block
[32:31] height and which Epoch we are currently
[32:34] in I love the level of detail they put
[32:37] in in this masterpiece and make sure to
[32:40] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[32:42] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[32:45] love those watches so so much if you
[32:48] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[32:51] regular basis I'll guess you already
[32:53] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[32:55] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[32:59] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[33:01] personal recommendation for Hardware
[33:03] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[33:05] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[33:08] gift for a friend who has still their
[33:10] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[33:13] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[33:16] checkout visit bitbox dos Swiss robobin
[33:20] to get your bitbox and the next step is
[33:23] to really level up your sovereignty as
[33:25] an individual you have to have have the
[33:28] most secure self- custody setup you have
[33:30] to secure your own devices you have to
[33:34] protect your privacy you have to set up
[33:36] an inheritance plan and depending on
[33:39] where you live you even want to have a
[33:41] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[33:44] in case something goes really really
[33:46] wrong and through all those steps the
[33:48] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[33:51] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[33:53] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[33:57] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[34:00] how you can level up your sovereignty
[34:03] it's it's super interesting for me
[34:04] because it's one of the um efforts to
[34:08] make the digital life a little bit more
[34:12] decentralized uh
[34:14] because I I talked with the guy from
[34:16] iptc and I love that example because he
[34:18] just like has a website and Bitcoin he
[34:21] only accepts Bitcoin payments and he
[34:23] only pays people in Bitcoin so with that
[34:26] he's completely outside of the feat
[34:28] system when it comes to payment and
[34:30] money so he doesn't need a bank account
[34:32] he doesn't need a jurisdiction per se
[34:34] because it's just Bitcoin uh but the
[34:37] website is still uh centralized and if
[34:40] if we can also decentralize that so
[34:43] nobody can take away that website nobody
[34:45] can take away your money that would be
[34:48] kind of the the future the kind of the
[34:50] the vision of uh the sovereign
[34:52] individual I just have a lot of like it
[34:56] feels like it's very early on it feels
[34:58] like it's it's uh we we everyone is used
[35:01] to just like go on a safari Google
[35:03] Chrome whatever they use and type in the
[35:05] address everyone is so used to that so
[35:08] uh but the same same is was true or is
[35:10] true for Bitcoin and and Fiat money it's
[35:13] like a huge Network effects that are
[35:15] playing to that um but what I was but
[35:19] what I was um kind of wondering H how do
[35:22] we make sure that we use one protocol
[35:26] that that we use one uh spaces protocol
[35:30] kind of the same the same question that
[35:33] people have with altcoins and I think my
[35:36] audience understands why we focus on
[35:38] bitcoin and and not all the altcoins and
[35:40] we stay Bitcoin only or like most of
[35:42] them at least do uh what is kind of the
[35:45] argument of like the the spaces protocol
[35:47] versus maybe there are some some other
[35:49] protocols that come up like how how how
[35:52] are we ensuring that there is not like
[35:54] three four five different protocols
[35:57] where you always have like uh a mic at a
[36:00] Bitcoin how how do we do that yeah I
[36:03] mean that's a good question uh it is
[36:06] similar to bitcoin it's like anybody
[36:08] could Fork Bitcoin and um you know call
[36:11] it Bitcoin too or Bitcoin cash whatever
[36:15] and so uh so yeah it is it's it is uh
[36:20] it's a good question and I guess my
[36:22] answer is it is early it's super early I
[36:25] mean and but I know there's a huge need
[36:30] for this thing I I just have the strong
[36:32] conviction plus it's I think it's it's
[36:35] verified by the market I mean some of
[36:37] these like ens you know valued at like a
[36:41] billion dollars like some of some of the
[36:43] and other companies that have done
[36:45] decentralized domains have been valued
[36:47] similarly so um so it's something that's
[36:52] super needed and but it hasn't been done
[36:54] right yet it hasn't been done right yet
[36:57] so my goal with impervious in the space
[37:00] of protocol has been to try to do it
[37:02] right you know do it on bitcoin do it
[37:04] Cipher Punk do it a way that scales and
[37:07] so I think we have you know we've we've
[37:10] learned by from a lot of other things
[37:12] like
[37:12] namecoin um you ask handshake we've
[37:15] learned what they did and what was good
[37:18] and what maybe didn't work out so well
[37:21] and so that's what we launched with uh
[37:24] and you know maybe spaces isn't isn't
[37:27] going to be maybe it won't be the one
[37:30] that's used but I think it's a step
[37:32] there and maybe it will be I don't know
[37:34] but you know it's the first time that I
[37:35] think a serious decentralized naming
[37:38] thing is on
[37:39] bitcoin uh that's that is done in a
[37:43] smart way so I think it has a shot but
[37:47] yeah the the determining factor and I
[37:50] don't think it has to be a zero some
[37:51] game you know maybe some could a lot of
[37:54] people will use this a lot of people
[37:55] will use that but really the the
[37:57] determining Factor will be how how
[37:59] widely people use it you know and how
[38:01] how useful it is to people and there's
[38:04] always I just search that uh can I yes
[38:08] here it is because um a lot of people uh
[38:12] don't know that but there has been a lot
[38:15] of developments before Bitcoin like the
[38:18] Bitcoin was not just like this crazy
[38:20] Innovative thing where nothing similar
[38:23] ever has happened before uh there's a
[38:26] lot of Technology of innovation that was
[38:29] developed before and then Z nakam kind
[38:32] of built everything together but the
[38:34] idea of of Bitcoin the idea of
[38:36] decentralized money in Bitcoin uh
[38:38] decentralized money on the internet is
[38:41] not a new one uh that has been around
[38:44] since like 1995 1998 like a lot of
[38:47] interviews from other people uh that say
[38:49] like oh we need that and and this we
[38:51] this would be really cool uh and I think
[38:54] is is that the picture that I'm
[38:56] searching
[38:58] uh yeah I think that is wait let me
[39:00] quickly share it uh I think that's that
[39:04] makes things maybe easier to explain um
[39:07] you probably know that that that uh uh
[39:11] graphic uh and there has been a lot of
[39:14] Innovations a lot of Technology things
[39:17] that happened before we could have come
[39:19] to to bitcoin because a lot of people
[39:21] also say when they come to bitcoin oh
[39:23] Bitcoin will be just like Myspace and
[39:25] then there's a Facebook coming along and
[39:26] stuff like that which is obviously BS um
[39:30] but I I kind of Imagine maybe the same
[39:32] thing for decentralizing domain names
[39:36] same thing for uh decentralizing other
[39:39] things maybe also Nostra maybe Nostra is
[39:41] not the the main one that we Lo use for
[39:43] the communication social media there
[39:45] might be another one coming um but I
[39:48] think the important thing here is that
[39:51] we they keep going and that we keep like
[39:54] uh experimenting and developing and
[39:58] researching that we have that vision of
[40:01] the sovereign individual in mind and try
[40:03] to think of like okay where are central
[40:06] point of failures and how can we
[40:08] eliminate those central point of
[40:10] failures that's why I absolutely love
[40:12] that I also love that you do it on
[40:14] bitcoin you don't have an own token or
[40:16] something like that uh because as soon
[40:18] as there's like an own token involved in
[40:20] that like I'm I'm usually thinking like
[40:23] might be a scam might be someone
[40:26] thinking like I have innovative the
[40:27] thing and I want to sell you something
[40:29] and then after one year I'm gone but so
[40:32] I I think we we need that development
[40:34] and when we look at that graphic that I
[40:36] just showed I think we we also have a
[40:39] lot of uh understanding that uh a big
[40:43] change needs a lot of development and
[40:47] the first might not work uh the second
[40:49] might not work the third might not work
[40:51] but maybe the fourth worked but maybe
[40:53] also the first worked like we don't know
[40:56] uh did P P protocol uh is still around
[41:00] and still really dominant I would say so
[41:03] yeah that's kind of my thoughts around
[41:05] that topic and and how I see it is that
[41:08] a fair assumption yeah I think that's
[41:11] totally right I think that's right on I
[41:13] mean uh yeah I think
[41:17] um yeah I mean like for example the zero
[41:19] knowledge proofs like we that's pretty
[41:22] recent development and that's something
[41:25] that would be much more difficult to
[41:27] build spaces without zero knowledge
[41:29] proofs I don't even know how we would do
[41:32] it so uh so that you know what what is
[41:36] zero knowledge proofs zero knowledge
[41:38] proofs are uh it's a way to verify some
[41:44] data really quickly with a small hash
[41:47] basically it's like so how we're using
[41:50] it a spaces is for subspaces like um so
[41:54] like if you own app Bitcoin and you have
[41:56] let's say you have tens of millions of
[41:58] subspaces under it so there's like 10
[42:01] million names under at Bitcoin so
[42:03] there's Mike at Bitcoin Robin at Bitcoin
[42:05] or whatever um so you can uh verify that
[42:09] all all those names can be linked to
[42:12] keys and you can verify if I have the
[42:15] key for Mike at Bitcoin uh you can
[42:18] quickly verify that yes he uh I own it
[42:22] you can verify that very quickly with
[42:24] just a with just a hash small hash um so
[42:29] that's a zero knowledge proof is that
[42:30] you don't need all the data to verify
[42:33] that like I um that I own like I I do
[42:37] own my Bitcoin here's my key it proves
[42:40] that I own it and that's kind of the the
[42:41] best Innovations where we just like have
[42:43] a lot of great Technologies and we put
[42:46] it together and it makes that perfect
[42:48] puzzle piece the perfect thing that we
[42:51] needed and same with with Bitcoin and
[42:53] the same maybe with with spaces uh would
[42:56] be would be amazing to see honestly yeah
[42:59] I really like your point about the
[43:00] sovereign individual I mean that's
[43:03] exactly what what we're going for here
[43:05] the sovereign individual like money is
[43:07] super important for a sovereign
[43:09] individual and so is so is naming you
[43:12] know it's it's really important so yeah
[43:14] that's I think this helps it this helps
[43:17] bring about that more sovereign
[43:18] individual and I think you're example of
[43:20] that guy who just pays with Bitcoin
[43:23] accepts Bitcoin but he still has the
[43:24] website I think that's a great example
[43:26] absolutely absolutely because it it
[43:28] works as long as the website is up
[43:30] because he cannot take his bank account
[43:32] because he has no bank account uh but
[43:36] they kind of take away the the website
[43:39] and it's it's obviously like um it's
[43:44] it's way more likely and way easier if
[43:46] he has like an uh an address and he's um
[43:51] listed there that they like just like ah
[43:53] he doesn't pay his taxes no like let's
[43:55] let's take away his his bank account and
[43:58] stuff like that so is already so much
[44:01] better that he can operate outside of
[44:03] the normal banking system like that's
[44:05] like a a huge step forward but for a
[44:08] full sovereignty Vision we need that
[44:11] last part also yeah uh and yeah the
[44:16] there might be people saying oh why do
[44:17] we need that I trust my government but
[44:20] yeah like tons of tons of um um examples
[44:26] of why you should not always trust the
[44:28] government and why it's maybe a good
[44:29] idea to build those sovereignty tools
[44:32] even though like uh what if we don't
[44:35] have to trust the government because
[44:37] they don't they cannot give it they
[44:39] cannot take something from us that's the
[44:41] best trust you can have like not having
[44:44] to trust someone is the best trust you
[44:47] can have because you you don't even have
[44:49] the
[44:49] possibility of of taking it away so I I
[44:52] really hope that we we kind of come to
[44:55] that sovereign individual um future may
[44:59] maybe an interesting question what else
[45:01] do you think is is kind of missing we
[45:03] have the naming now with maybe with
[45:05] spaces with have Nostra maybe with with
[45:07] with communication with Bitcoin for
[45:08] money uh what else do you do you feel
[45:11] like is is missing with like maybe
[45:13] governments maybe with other uh things
[45:16] for for that sovereign individual
[45:19] Vision that's a good question I don't
[45:22] know I mean yeah I think I think
[45:25] thinking about that and and figuring it
[45:27] out would be great um for yeah whatever
[45:31] helps make people more more Sovereign is
[45:35] great the only reason I know about
[45:37] naming is because I worked in naming for
[45:39] 10 years like with DNS and stuff like
[45:41] that and I just I know how important it
[45:43] is and where all the problems are and
[45:47] how it's exactly like a bank like you
[45:49] know needing to rely I mean it's even
[45:51] worse in some ways relying on that so
[45:54] and how important names are and so
[45:57] that's the that's the main reason I have
[45:59] focused on this is because I I realize
[46:02] this so hopefully there's other people
[46:03] in other areas that you know see similar
[46:07] problems and can can help that
[46:12] absolutely yeah really cool um I have
[46:14] one question that each of my my guests
[46:16] get um what can we learn from you
[46:19] besides Bitcoin besides Bitcoin well I'm
[46:23] also bringing back frenster frenster the
[46:27] old social networking site I uh am uh
[46:30] relaunching that and bringing it back so
[46:34] um yeah I'm hoping to also tie in spaces
[46:37] to that so each frster user will get uh
[46:40] a decentralized uh at frster um username
[46:44] that's on spaces so but but you own uh
[46:48] frster right now right the domain yeah
[46:52] yeah cool what made you buy friender to
[46:56] begin with
[46:58] well I I actually used it when it first
[47:01] came out and I and at the time I really
[47:03] thought it was cool it was the first
[47:04] social networking site and it was it was
[47:06] like wow this is this is cool this is
[47:09] different you know this is a it seemed
[47:11] like a game Cher at the time and but it
[47:13] was also a time when social networking
[47:16] was different it was like more positive
[47:18] and it was about connecting with people
[47:19] and being friendly and stuff and then it
[47:22] kind of got poisoned over time I think
[47:25] by I don't know advertising ERS
[47:28] and uh you know clicks getting clicks
[47:31] and algorithms add algorithms to do
[47:35] stuff and it became this like really
[47:37] negative space and so anyway I had
[47:41] checked frer off and on the domain to
[47:44] see what was happening with it and at
[47:46] one point I saw it it was resolving but
[47:49] it was just ads on there and I looked up
[47:52] who owned it and it actually was
[47:53] somebody I uh knew from the domain
[47:56] business
[47:57] um somebody who was a who had uh was a
[47:59] user of
[48:01] park.io uh and so I reached out and
[48:03] bought it from from him and I and I
[48:05] thought well I'll try to I'll bring this
[48:07] back it might be fun might be fun fun to
[48:10] bring friender back so so I I set it up
[48:14] and built it it's up there and uh I put
[48:18] up a waiting list and it has like right
[48:21] now over 250,000 people on the waiting
[48:23] list and I've been letting people in uh
[48:26] slow there's there's thousands of users
[48:28] now but I'm trying to do it in a way to
[48:31] make it not just in the best I'm trying
[48:34] to do it you know a good way until I
[48:37] open it up completely so absolutely it's
[48:40] it's it's a cool domain to have I think
[48:43] can build you can build a lot of
[48:46] interesting stuff in there um we have um
[48:49] tin in the podcast where the previous
[48:52] guest is asking a question for the next
[48:54] guest without knowing who the next guest
[48:55] actually is and it's a question where I
[48:58] just want to pre say you don't have
[49:01] to you don't have to say how how your
[49:04] self custody solution looks like uh but
[49:07] he asked uh as a specific reason also if
[49:10] you died tomorrow would you be able to
[49:12] access would someone be able to access
[49:15] your Bitcoin and he asked with the
[49:16] background of um he thinks most
[49:19] bitcoiners don't have an inheritance
[49:22] plan and if if they die like their
[49:25] family doesn't even know how to act them
[49:27] uh in that background he asked for it
[49:31] yeah that's a good that's a good
[49:34] question I I don't I I hope they will be
[49:37] able to but um you know I I think it's
[49:42] yeah for me it's a lot about
[49:45] like I've kind of told uh you know my I
[49:50] I told my wife basically like if
[49:53] something happens to me here's the
[49:54] people I really trust you know like you
[49:57] can trust these people and they know
[49:59] what to do so uh reach out to them and
[50:02] uh I hope you you can do it but yeah I
[50:05] know it's it is a tricky it's a tricky
[50:08] thing balancing security with um that
[50:12] stuff absolutely yeah it's it's it's
[50:15] something uh not not easy to do and
[50:18] everyone has to look at his own
[50:20] situation and try to figure out the best
[50:23] solution for that because there's not
[50:24] like a one size fits all and yeah it's
[50:27] kind of good that there's not a one siiz
[50:28] fits all because then it there would be
[50:30] a lot of attack factors also for that
[50:33] yeah thank you so much um Mike for being
[50:35] on uh before I let you go where can
[50:37] people find you ask your questions I
[50:39] guess friend.com is is one address yeah
[50:43] yeah you can email me Mike ATF
[50:44] friendster.com uh or yeah you can check
[50:47] out the spaces protocol spaces protocol.
[50:49] org um my company that created spaces
[50:54] protocol is impervious which you can
[50:55] find at impervious
[50:57] .c uh and there's a link to spaces
[50:59] protocol there and uh yeah if you want
[51:02] to find me on Twitter or x uh you can go
[51:06] to I have you can go to Cipher punk.com
[51:08] and that redirects to my Twitter account
[51:11] so yeah oh wait you own also Cipher
[51:14] punk.com
[51:15] yeah that's a great one I love that and
[51:19] you just redirected to to to your
[51:21] Twitter handle yeah for now yeah until I
[51:23] figure out what to do with it that's
[51:25] amazing
[51:27] I I I love the domain space Also for
[51:29] some reason um the first time I really
[51:32] was aware getting aware of the domain
[51:34] space was actually with Michael sailor
[51:36] uh because he has like mike.com he
[51:38] bought voice.com I think he sold it now
[51:40] like a bunch of a lot of interesting
[51:42] domains I also love that at hope.com
[51:45] there's Bitcoin stuff and even because
[51:48] Michael sailor in uh was on my podcast
[51:50] also so like if you go on hope.com I'm
[51:53] also popping up there so
[51:58] through Michael so like I I really like
[52:01] that that I can access now one video of
[52:03] mine with hope.com yeah that's great
[52:07] yeah I know sailor yeah he's he's he he
[52:10] understood you know do he's he
[52:13] understood how you know it's interesting
[52:15] that he's also into domains and Bitcoin
[52:18] like you know they're very similar so I
[52:21] think um you know it's a similar thing
[52:23] they're digital assets absolutely dig
[52:25] digital real estate I think
[52:27] he he he always call it in the beginning
[52:29] yeah thank you so much Mike for being on
[52:30] also thank you so much for everyone that
[52:32] is watching and listening for joining us
[52:34] today as always I'll be back tomorrow
[52:36] with another episode bye-bye
[52:38] [Music]
