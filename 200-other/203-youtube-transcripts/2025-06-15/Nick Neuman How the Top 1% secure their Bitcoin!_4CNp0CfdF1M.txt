[00:00] self- custody can be mainstream
[00:01] custodians have been holding our money
[00:04] our stocks our bonds for us for
[00:06] centuries but what has changed with
[00:09] Bitcoin is just that Bitcoin is now
[00:10] digital money relative to any other
[00:12] point in history it's very easy for
[00:14] people to self- custody in a secure way
[00:17] it can be a systemic risk to bitcoin to
[00:19] have most of it sitting with custodians
[00:21] just because it's very identifiable
[00:23] where it is at that point that change in
[00:25] technology is really powerful and really
[00:28] has the potential to change the banking
[00:30] model because now banks have to think
[00:32] about what are all the services that I
[00:34] provide around this custody model
[00:37] instead of just how do I aggregate
[00:40] Assets in order to lend them out when
[00:42] you give people more responsibility they
[00:45] improve the quality of how they act
[00:47] thanks to cryptography and private
[00:50] [Music]
[00:53] Keys why aren't people taking more self-
[00:57] custody I I always bring that example of
[00:59] I have like a few friends of mine who
[01:01] are almost all in in Bitcoin and they
[01:03] still don't have self- custody they
[01:05] still have it completely on Exchange um
[01:07] why do you think those people don't take
[01:10] self- custody what mindset barriers uh
[01:13] do they have to overcome I mean I think
[01:15] there's a couple of reasons here what's
[01:18] interesting is there there's actually a
[01:19] lot of Bitcoin protected in self-
[01:22] custody
[01:23] and the more Bitcoin that you protect
[01:27] the more likely you are actually to be
[01:28] self- custody and that Bitcoin I think
[01:31] because you're having to protect a much
[01:33] larger value and really think about what
[01:36] are the things that could go wrong here
[01:40] and
[01:41] um it's just much more painful to lose a
[01:44] large amount of Bitcoin and so you're
[01:45] thinking much more seriously about your
[01:47] security I think that for people who are
[01:52] not comfortable with self- custody a lot
[01:54] of that comes from really two things it
[01:58] comes from fact that this is a very new
[02:00] behavior for centuries now we've been
[02:03] securing Bitcoin using uh or securing
[02:06] money sorry using Banks right like
[02:09] custodians have been holding our money
[02:13] our stocks our bonds for us for
[02:16] centuries and so it's a very well-worn
[02:20] path to you to trust somebody else to
[02:24] secure your money for you and the reason
[02:26] that that was all built up so long ago
[02:29] was the fact that money was physical and
[02:31] so it was much harder to protect and you
[02:34] really needed somebody who specialized
[02:36] in building a bank or you know building
[02:40] a building that can be heavily
[02:42] fortified and able to secure money so
[02:47] that uh individual people didn't have to
[02:50] like think about how they were going to
[02:51] keep this safe in their houses which was
[02:53] very difficult at the time
[02:56] so that was why that all started but
[02:58] what has changed with Bitcoin is just
[03:01] that Bitcoin is now digital money
[03:03] relative to any other point in history
[03:04] it's very easy for people to self
[03:06] custody in a secure way and to have a
[03:09] very secure setup that can help them
[03:12] secure anywhere from a couple dollars
[03:14] worth of bitcoin to you know thousands
[03:17] of Bitcoin or more and so I think this
[03:20] is something that is a change in
[03:22] technology that Bitcoin brings but the
[03:24] human behavior and the comfort with this
[03:26] hasn't quite caught up yet and then the
[03:28] second big reason why I don't think
[03:30] people self custody is when they hear
[03:32] what you have to do to self custody in a
[03:34] secure way it's a nightmare and so they
[03:37] just you know you're like you got to
[03:39] have this Hardware wallet that you write
[03:41] down this seed phrase for a seed phrase
[03:44] is 12 or 24 words and if you lose it you
[03:47] lose all your Bitcoin make sure somebody
[03:49] doesn't steal it too because or make
[03:52] sure you don't give it to anybody else
[03:54] because then they can steal your Bitcoin
[03:57] so when you the way that people have had
[04:02] uh historically to protect themselves
[04:05] when they're self- custody has just been
[04:06] incredibly difficult so to us when we
[04:10] think about this at Casa we think about
[04:11] how do we help people understand from a
[04:15] human behavior perspective why this
[04:19] makes sense and why the technology of
[04:20] Bitcoin unlocks self- custody as a new
[04:25] behavior for them and as something
[04:27] that's actually great for their life and
[04:29] then we also focus a ton on building
[04:32] things that are really simple for people
[04:33] to use because people don't want to
[04:36] spend all their time trying to figure
[04:39] out how to be secure they just want
[04:42] somebody to tell them how to do it so
[04:44] it's the same kind of corollary to I'm
[04:48] going to store my gold in a bank because
[04:51] the bank is the Security Experts that
[04:53] can secure it for me that uh with
[04:56] Bitcoin you can secure it yourself but
[04:59] you still want the Security Experts to
[05:00] be telling you how to do it you don't
[05:02] want to spend all of your time becoming
[05:04] a security expert and staying up to date
[05:05] with things and for a lot of the self-
[05:08] custody solutions that are out there
[05:10] that's what you have to do with Casa
[05:12] what we really tried to do is make it so
[05:13] that all you got to do is do what the
[05:15] product tells you to and you're in great
[05:17] shape so those are the two main reasons
[05:20] that I think there's been a like a lot
[05:23] of people when you talk to them feel
[05:25] hesitant to self custody and they're
[05:27] things that that we're always working to
[05:29] to make better I think also it could be
[05:32] um uh the technical aspect of it is is a
[05:36] big one because they come into like oh
[05:38] like okay there's a hardware wallet okay
[05:40] I have a pin oh I have a backup seat for
[05:42] if the hardware wallet gets destroyed
[05:44] and then oh there's like steel wallets
[05:45] and like it I think if if people hear
[05:48] too many words they don't understand
[05:50] they they click off and and they then go
[05:52] on on their day like oh okay I trusted
[05:55] my money with with banks so why not
[05:57] trust my my Bitcoin also with banks so I
[05:59] think like that's a a huge part of like
[06:02] like there are too many words that I
[06:04] don't understand and I just click off I
[06:06] think we we underestimate how big
[06:09] psychology plays into that but do you
[06:11] think we come to a point where self-
[06:13] custody is is something mainstream uh
[06:17] and something that uh most of the the
[06:20] people will do and like most of the
[06:22] bitcoiners will
[06:24] do so I think that from a technology
[06:28] perspective and from a product
[06:30] experience perspective Casa is to the
[06:33] point where self- custody can be
[06:35] mainstream and actually this has taken
[06:37] quite a bit of time to build up to but
[06:41] we've the last couple of major feature
[06:43] releases that we've put out
[06:45] there have really taken huge steps
[06:49] towards making this finally feel like a
[06:51] package that anybody can use to self-
[06:55] custody their Bitcoin and feel
[06:56] comfortable doing it and that's earlier
[06:59] this year we release the casa
[07:00] inheritance feature which solves the
[07:02] problem of what happens if I die um and
[07:05] I'm self- cing my Bitcoin how do I make
[07:06] sure that my family can access that and
[07:09] then the second feature that we just
[07:13] released um a little over a month ago is
[07:17] being able to use a UB key as part of
[07:19] your casa setup and so one of the main
[07:21] friction points that we have always seen
[07:24] was that while all of the casa software
[07:27] was very easy for people to use using a
[07:30] hardware wallet and going to the
[07:31] hardware wallet manufacturers software
[07:34] interface always was pretty it was it
[07:37] was a pretty big hurdle for people who
[07:40] didn't know what they were doing and who
[07:41] weren't already comfortable with
[07:43] Hardware wallets so the UB key is a very
[07:47] simple way for people to hold a Bitcoin
[07:51] key offline in Cold Storage on a
[07:55] dedicated device and then use it with
[07:58] Casa software in a way where it's just a
[08:01] tap in order to uh sign or transact with
[08:06] the key that's held on that UB key and
[08:08] so it's a I I really think that we've HD
[08:12] on this perfect solution where we can
[08:14] take this more mainstream now because
[08:17] we've really solved all the edge case
[08:19] problems like inheritance and then we've
[08:21] also solved the user experience problem
[08:25] with UB keys and so um I think this is
[08:30] something that over
[08:31] time the vast majority of people will
[08:36] shift to having at least some of their
[08:38] Bitcoin in self- custody you're always
[08:40] going to have you know people who
[08:42] diversify their risk or who they want to
[08:44] keep some on an exchange because they uh
[08:48] trade with it more often or whatever
[08:51] they want to do with it but I think that
[08:53] from a a technology perspective we are
[08:56] there and now it's about telling that
[08:58] story in a way that everybody
[09:01] understands hey we've solved a lot of
[09:03] these problems here's why you should
[09:04] care about self- custody here's why the
[09:07] exchange or custodian that you're
[09:09] keeping your Bitcoin with is not as safe
[09:12] as you think and you should take that
[09:16] responsibility into your own hands
[09:17] because nobody cares as much as you do
[09:19] about protecting your own money and
[09:21] that's something that I think is a is a
[09:23] big misconception or has been a big
[09:26] misconception for bitcoiners so far
[09:28] because they're like well
[09:30] I don't really know how to do this so
[09:32] I'm going to trust that this company
[09:34] over here will do a better job than me
[09:37] because it's their it's part of their
[09:40] technology stack it's part of what
[09:42] they've built and they're gonna they're
[09:44] going to do a better job than me at
[09:46] securing this and I think that depending
[09:48] on the company you're working with that
[09:51] um could be true but even if they are
[09:55] doing a better job than you without the
[09:57] right tools would do there's still a
[10:00] bunch of points of vulnerability because
[10:02] of how Bitcoin works as a at its base as
[10:06] money with irreversible transactions
[10:09] based on cryptography and private keys
[10:11] and a decentralized network of nodes and
[10:15] miners that makes it not a good fit for
[10:20] custodial Solutions it's actually just a
[10:23] much better fit from a security
[10:25] perspective for self- custody and so as
[10:28] people start to understand that
[10:31] understand some of those risks and um
[10:34] and then realize oh I don't have to go
[10:37] this alone I can use a company like Casa
[10:39] to help me do this easily I think that's
[10:41] how we we see this flip and more and
[10:43] more people adopting self- custody yeah
[10:47] absolutely um the UI key one is is
[10:49] really interesting as I worked a little
[10:52] bit in it security and I know all my it
[10:54] security friends are crazy about yuy
[10:57] everyone is like yeah I use yub key for
[10:59] your passwords like even for all your
[11:01] logins you should have UB key there so I
[11:05] I know UB key uh knew that before you I
[11:08] think you announced it on on uh in the
[11:11] Nashville conference I think the first
[11:13] time you you told you told about that
[11:16] um obviously it's way more user friendly
[11:21] UB it's just a tab and it's it's a
[11:23] easier setup are there any backd draws
[11:26] to it any disadvantages to it uh or is
[11:29] there any level where you're like okay
[11:31] if if you have that many Bitcoins it
[11:33] really makes sense to to use Hardware
[11:35] wallets is there any uh difference
[11:37] between using Hardware wallets versus
[11:38] using the U Keys yeah there is so the
[11:42] main difference between Hardware wallets
[11:43] and U Keys is that um a hardware wallet
[11:47] has the ability to actually verify and
[11:49] sign Bitcoin transactions on the device
[11:53] itself whereas a UB key can't do that
[11:56] today and so the way that we've
[11:58] integrated UB Keys is we like a hardware
[12:01] wallet we are storing the actual Bitcoin
[12:04] key on the UB key device and so you get
[12:07] cold storage for 99% of this key
[12:12] existence and that's what really matters
[12:14] right it's one of the most important
[12:17] pieces of self- custody is you want to
[12:20] make sure that you have keys that are
[12:22] stored on offline
[12:25] devices um so some part of the tradeoff
[12:30] is that when you use a UB key with Casa
[12:33] the way that it works is that key is
[12:35] stored on the UB key you plug it into
[12:37] your computer in order to sign a Bitcoin
[12:40] transaction and the UB key decrypts the
[12:44] Bitcoin key sends that Bitcoin key to
[12:47] the casa software which signs with the
[12:50] key on the transaction that you're
[12:52] actually doing at the time and then
[12:55] throws the key away all in the same
[12:57] function so the key is not stored on
[13:01] Casa's servers it's never stored in
[13:03] Casa's software but the key becomes hot
[13:06] basically which means it it touches an
[13:09] online device for that Split Second
[13:12] where it's signing a
[13:13] transaction and so by that nature that's
[13:16] going to make it less secure than a
[13:18] hardware wallet and that's why we call
[13:20] it instead of calling it cold storage or
[13:22] a cold key we actually call UB Keys cool
[13:25] keys because they're cold for the major
[13:29] majority of that key life but then the
[13:31] couple of times when you're actually
[13:32] using it it becomes a hotkey so why are
[13:36] we comfortable with this we're
[13:37] comfortable with it because this is part
[13:39] of the overall Casa security model where
[13:43] that UB key that the Bitcoin key that's
[13:45] on that UB key is not the only key
[13:47] protecting your Bitcoin it's part of a
[13:50] multisig where you need multiple keys to
[13:52] move any Bitcoin and so the compromise
[13:55] of any one key becomes less important
[13:59] and it's more about how do you secure
[14:02] the whole set of keys and what are the
[14:04] different tradeoffs of each type of key
[14:07] that you're using in order to give you
[14:08] the best balance between Simplicity and
[14:12] security and so that's why we feel
[14:15] comfortable with UB Keys as one of the
[14:17] types of keys and you can set up your
[14:20] Kasa multisig where you've got one of
[14:23] your keys on a UB key and then one or
[14:25] more of your keys on Hardware wallets
[14:27] too and so that way you still get that
[14:29] benefit from the hardware wallet but the
[14:32] UB key is uh replaces one of your
[14:36] Hardware wallets where it just makes it
[14:38] a little bit easier overall when you're
[14:40] going to transact maybe you use that UB
[14:43] key as part of a a casa inheritance
[14:45] setup so that your family your spouse um
[14:50] if they were going to be uh they needed
[14:53] to access your Bitcoin in a scenario
[14:55] where you passed away they have an
[14:57] easier key to use than trying to figure
[14:59] out how to use a hardware wallet which a
[15:01] lot of people are intimidated by and so
[15:05] it's part of an overall security setup
[15:07] so yes you take a little bit of a
[15:09] security hit from a typical Hardware
[15:11] wallet but when you take into account
[15:12] the security of the entire system it's
[15:15] actually still really solid and really
[15:17] strong but Kasa offers uh both with card
[15:21] with hard wallets and with uh ubk so
[15:24] like that like you can basically choose
[15:26] what what you prefer as an individual
[15:29] yeah exactly so you can you can you you
[15:31] can use UB Keys you can use Hardware
[15:33] wallets we have the ability to have one
[15:35] key that's on your phone and then
[15:37] there's also always a key held by Casa
[15:39] and so you you have this nice mix of
[15:42] different types of devices different
[15:44] types of key storage ranging from cold
[15:46] to hot that really let you set up a
[15:51] robust usable security system and this
[15:54] feels uh to people who are new this
[15:58] might feel like a lot it might feel like
[15:59] a lot of decisions that they got to make
[16:02] we make a lot of these decisions for you
[16:04] in the product we guide you through the
[16:06] product in a way that you we have very
[16:09] strong defaults basically so that you
[16:11] can just go with what we are telling you
[16:13] to do but then um if you don't want to
[16:16] take that default path then you can
[16:19] change things up for to to match your
[16:21] situation and we still support a a very
[16:24] broad range of other Hardware wallets
[16:25] and devices that can help you do that
[16:28] securely and just interesting um I think
[16:30] collaborative custody has a lot of very
[16:33] unique very interesting advantages um
[16:37] why do you think that I mean you could
[16:39] also have uh started a company just
[16:42] advising people on self- custody and and
[16:44] do them do all the keys themselves like
[16:47] um there are other companies that just
[16:49] do that um why did you choose to make a
[16:52] company where there is uh intentionally
[16:55] one key with the company and two or uh
[16:59] four other keys with with the with the
[17:02] client what what advantages does that
[17:04] bring well I think it gives people a lot
[17:07] of peace of mind they always know that
[17:09] they're going to be able to access the
[17:11] casa key and so if they make a mistake
[17:14] lose one lose two of their keys the casa
[17:18] key is always there to be one signature
[17:20] that they need in order to access their
[17:22] Bitcoin
[17:24] and as much as we say don't trust verify
[17:28] in in
[17:30] Bitcoin we are humans and humans want to
[17:32] trust people like go back to wanting to
[17:34] trust custodians and in at the beginning
[17:37] of our discussion right we want to um
[17:41] trust that somebody knows what they are
[17:44] doing in this area and can help us do it
[17:46] well and so as we were building Casa
[17:49] having the casa key be part of people's
[17:51] setup means they people can trust that
[17:54] we're going to protect that key well but
[17:58] let's say cost was ever malicious or
[18:00] Casa was compromised in some way that
[18:03] one key isn't enough to do anything with
[18:06] our customers funds by itself and so
[18:09] it's the right balance between being
[18:11] able to have Casa as a backup allowing
[18:14] your family to use Casa as a backup in
[18:17] case something bad happens and not
[18:20] having full control and like having to
[18:22] fully trust Casa like you would a
[18:24] custodian interesting also with with
[18:26] trust um that's an really interesting
[18:28] discussion that I always have on the
[18:29] podcast because I feel like um sometimes
[18:31] we go too far out of the freedom uh
[18:35] Spectrum where we want to be too
[18:38] independent uh and I explain a little
[18:40] bit what I mean with that I think we
[18:42] always have dependencies on other people
[18:44] and I think those are good because if
[18:46] you don't have any dependencies like the
[18:49] the the trash of of of your home will
[18:52] not get carried away you have to do it
[18:54] yourself uh if if you have uh no no
[18:57] other people that help you in any way of
[18:59] shape or form you're basically yourself
[19:01] in in the woods and and forests and
[19:02] fighting against animals I think the the
[19:05] the freedom aspect is like you should
[19:07] not be free of any other human being but
[19:10] you should be free in your decision
[19:11] making so I like collaborative uh um
[19:14] models a lot because we do trust other
[19:18] human beings and we should trust other
[19:20] human beings uh like a bus driver that
[19:23] we trust that he will not crash the bus
[19:25] and stuff like that right uh trust to a
[19:28] certain extent is good as long as we
[19:30] have the control so I like the model
[19:32] where uh you have trust in someone else
[19:35] but you still have the control over your
[19:38] keys especially with with Bitcoin and
[19:40] and the possibilities of that what I was
[19:43] also is interesting for me is um when we
[19:47] look at the future of of self custody do
[19:50] you think that Cara is in the future
[19:53] kind of kind of The Future model of a
[19:55] Bitcoin Bank where uh you only help uh
[19:59] customers how to to help the Bitcoin
[20:01] maybe even with like um models uh above
[20:04] that I think unchain has that where they
[20:07] have like loans on on Bitcoins or they
[20:09] they they make something with that I'm
[20:11] not familiar with their product but I
[20:12] heard something around that do you think
[20:14] that this is the way to go where banks
[20:18] will in the future just hold like one
[20:20] out of five Keys uh and have then
[20:22] products around that banking products
[20:25] even around that uh do you see that that
[20:27] is the the future or how do you see that
[20:30] I think it does change how we approach
[20:32] the banking model overall because the
[20:35] banking model right now is all about
[20:38] taking in assets from taking in deposits
[20:41] from customers and then going and
[20:44] lending those deposits out to people to
[20:48] in order to generate a return for the
[20:50] bank and then some of that return gets
[20:52] paid back to the depositors but you know
[20:56] his historically it was a lot larger
[20:58] than it is these days these days it's
[21:00] very small amount so the way that this
[21:03] changes is I think that to date until
[21:07] Bitcoin was
[21:09] invented you had no other choice besides
[21:12] I have to put my money in a bank and so
[21:13] I have to allow the bank to lend out my
[21:15] money because if you don't want the bank
[21:17] to lend out your money then the only
[21:19] thing you can do is like stuff cash in a
[21:21] mattress basically and that's just not
[21:25] reasonable or practical for for people
[21:27] to do
[21:29] so uh now you can secure your own money
[21:33] you don't have to give it to a bank with
[21:36] the equivalent of a mobile app and a UB
[21:40] key and so it's something that can fit
[21:44] in your pocket and you can hold be
[21:46] holding Millions tens of millions of
[21:49] dollars worth of bitcoin in your pocket
[21:52] and that change in technology is really
[21:55] powerful and really has the potential to
[21:58] change the banking model because now
[22:01] banks have to think about what are all
[22:04] the services that I provide around this
[22:07] custody model instead of just how do I
[22:10] aggregate Assets in order to lend them
[22:13] out for um ba based on the depositors
[22:17] that are holding their money with me in
[22:19] the bank and so now that maybe changes
[22:21] the banking model
[22:23] where um banks have to make it more
[22:25] attractive to people to
[22:29] offer them some assets that they can go
[22:30] lend out to other people so instead of
[22:33] it being very small interest rates that
[22:36] you get on your deposits maybe you need
[22:38] higher interest rates in order to
[22:40] convince people to take some of their
[22:42] Capital out of self- custody and give it
[22:44] to the bank for Lending so I think that
[22:47] banks in this model they start to focus
[22:51] a lot more on the services around what
[22:53] they offer and they have to make those
[22:54] actually competitive again and people
[22:57] always have this exit path to self-
[23:00] custody in this scenario where um you
[23:04] know to dat you actually don't uh you
[23:06] haven't had that so when you look back
[23:08] at the
[23:10] svb uh Silicon Valley Bank
[23:13] meltdown um about a year ago year and a
[23:16] half ago when Silicon Valley Bank which
[23:19] is where a bunch of startups were
[23:20] keeping their money when they were going
[23:22] under and everybody was worried about it
[23:24] and there was a run on the bank there
[23:26] was no option really for people to sell
[23:28] custody those dollars I mean it's very
[23:31] difficult to get those into like Bitcoin
[23:32] or stable coins in short notice and then
[23:35] bring it to self- custody right and so
[23:38] what are people doing everybody's on
[23:41] these threads with other startup
[23:43] Founders being like what banks are you
[23:45] getting accounts opened at where can we
[23:47] go that's not going to fail people were
[23:50] wondering about all these different
[23:51] banks potentially failing and there was
[23:53] really not a good way to um to judge
[23:57] whether a bank was sound or not in that
[24:00] time where Banks everywhere were under a
[24:02] lot of pressure and so what I think is
[24:04] really interesting from a societal
[24:06] change perspective is if we can use
[24:09] self- custody as the exit valve for that
[24:13] where then people can be able to very
[24:16] easily take their money out of a bank
[24:18] and protect it themselves in a way that
[24:21] they know that money is safe and I think
[24:24] that's a really great net benefit to
[24:27] society of self- custody and of of what
[24:30] Bitcoin is pioneered here and so that's
[24:32] something that we're we're excited about
[24:35] and and I don't know that like to go
[24:37] back to your original question maybe
[24:39] Banks start holding keys for people I
[24:42] think that would make sense as part of
[24:43] their their traditional security model
[24:46] of helping secure people's money
[24:48] evolving but I think that even more
[24:50] important is just providing this option
[24:52] of an exit valve for people when they're
[24:55] not sure whether the bank is doing what
[24:57] they should be with their assets and
[24:58] they want to make sure that they can
[25:00] protect it themselves I love that exit
[25:03] wealth analogy because I feel like it's
[25:05] so important we have Bitcoin as an exit
[25:08] wealth from the Fiat system uh we have
[25:11] even in the social media landscape we
[25:13] have Nostra as an exit wealth to to
[25:15] Twitter we have Twitter an exit wealth
[25:17] from Facebook kind of so it's it's
[25:20] interesting uh just the um just the
[25:23] sheer existence of an exit wealth uh
[25:26] makes the existing system better better
[25:28] so it could even I think shortterm make
[25:31] even the Fiat system better and more um
[25:35] robust because then maybe banks are like
[25:38] yeah we should really take care of it
[25:40] because people are fleeing to to Bitcoin
[25:42] now they have something to actually flee
[25:44] to that is actually globally working not
[25:46] like gold that you can confiscate later
[25:48] so that's that's an interesting
[25:50] comparison uh uh to make yeah really
[25:52] really cool and I I want our like I
[25:55] I I think this is important for people
[25:58] who are making regulations to be
[25:59] thinking about too like politicians in
[26:02] government because um I think that what
[26:06] we've done over the decades is just
[26:09] build up more and more regulation around
[26:12] banks in order to make sure that they're
[26:14] doing the right thing with customers
[26:16] money and it all boils down to the
[26:18] principal agent problem right it's like
[26:21] the bank is not you they're acting on
[26:25] behalf of you in storing your money and
[26:28] so so they are never going to be as
[26:30] incentivized as you to take care of your
[26:33] money and so we got to in order to fix
[26:36] that we have to put in all these guard
[26:38] rails and we just keep building more and
[26:40] more guard rails on banks to make sure
[26:42] that they're not messing up with all of
[26:44] their customers money and the ultimate
[26:48] solution to that is to allow customers
[26:51] to withdraw to a simple secure digital
[26:55] self- custody in a way that provid
[26:58] provides that exit valve and doesn't
[27:01] require forcing the banks to comply with
[27:04] more and more regulations it just forces
[27:07] them through capitalism and through the
[27:09] market to be better at securing their
[27:13] customers Bitcoin because now they know
[27:15] that their customers can always take
[27:17] their their money to elsewhere to self-
[27:21] custody and to protect it themselves the
[27:23] two- partic question um how how do you
[27:26] see um yourself and Casa no KC and
[27:30] privacy for for for the services that
[27:32] you offer do you collect any data or how
[27:34] do you see that no so we um as a
[27:37] software provider that is not a
[27:40] custodian that doesn't do money
[27:43] transmission we do not need to we're not
[27:46] required by government laws to kyc our
[27:50] customers just like a you know whatever
[27:53] app that you decide to download online
[27:56] isn't required to kyc its customers and
[28:00] so um this is important to us because
[28:04] more and more data breaches are
[28:07] happening that cause really big problems
[28:10] for the people that are part of those
[28:12] data breaches I mean fishing around
[28:15] people's Bitcoin has become a rampant
[28:19] problem and it's gotten very
[28:22] sophisticated and it all stems from
[28:25] information that comes out in data
[28:27] breaches that allows people to be
[28:29] targeted for and and to be targeted for
[28:32] trying to steal their Bitcoin and so um
[28:35] for
[28:36] us we don't want to collect that
[28:38] information we don't want to make Casa
[28:41] into a honey pot and so unlike some of
[28:43] the other Solutions out there you can
[28:45] sign up for Casa under a completely
[28:47] Anonymous email with proton mail and not
[28:51] give us any of your personal identifying
[28:55] information and that's great because we
[28:58] don't want that information because we
[29:00] don't want to have to protect that
[29:02] against a data breach and when we do
[29:04] collect information like this we
[29:07] actually try to delete it when we're
[29:09] done with it in order to make sure that
[29:11] we aren't storing it so part of the
[29:13] Costa offering is um at some of the
[29:15] higher membership plans is that you can
[29:19] actually uh get a box sent to you with
[29:22] all the hardware like UB Keys Hardware
[29:24] wallets Faraday bags all the things that
[29:27] you need to set up a casa 30 of5 multi
[29:31] Vault and when we send we need we need
[29:35] your address to send you the box so
[29:38] after we send you the box we actually
[29:41] delete your address from our system once
[29:43] we know you have it and once you've
[29:45] gotten all the way onboard it and that
[29:47] way we don't have to keep that info it's
[29:50] not a risk to you and it's overall just
[29:54] a better privacy and security posture
[29:56] for our customers
[29:58] for companies that are keeping that info
[30:00] for longer periods of time um they are
[30:04] risking their
[30:05] customers physical security and so
[30:08] that's something that we are really
[30:10] careful with and you can even use a PO
[30:14] Box uh for for the address right you
[30:16] don't have to have your self home
[30:19] address for the delivery right yeah as
[30:21] long as you can get access to the
[30:23] wherever it's being mailed you can use
[30:26] whatever address you want I I think
[30:28] that's really important because then uh
[30:31] even Kasa um themselves is protecting it
[30:36] against maybe a compliance request from
[30:39] a government saying like hey um you have
[30:43] customer funds we would like to know
[30:45] what are the customers and you can say
[30:47] like oh we don't know like we have we
[30:50] have no clue like you can you don't even
[30:51] have the data to to put out that I think
[30:53] that's a really important thing uh for
[30:56] Bitcoin as an really important thing
[30:58] also for for that kind of a service yeah
[31:00] I think people don't always uh I think
[31:03] for whatever reason people assume that
[31:06] um Casa needs to kyc people or that we
[31:09] only serve certain like the us or
[31:12] something like that we serve people
[31:14] globally and we don't kyc and so uh this
[31:19] is a better business proposition for us
[31:22] and it's a better privacy proposition
[31:25] for our
[31:26] customers absolutely very cool um one
[31:29] thing that I ask myself a little bit if
[31:33] we don't get the self- custody route we
[31:36] we say like most of the people stay in
[31:38] exchanges stay in Bitcoin banks that
[31:41] actually hold all the keys and and
[31:43] people don't we we're not successful
[31:46] with um having people self- custody um
[31:49] do you feel like that could be a
[31:51] systemic risk to the Bitcoin or is just
[31:55] the existence of an exit wealth with
[31:57] self
[31:58] enough to make Bitcoin secure from a
[32:02] monetary perspective I think the exit
[32:04] valve helps but it's still a systemic
[32:06] risk to bitcoin if the vast majority of
[32:09] Bitcoin is held by
[32:10] custodians and that's because that just
[32:14] it creates a Honeypot for somebody to
[32:18] try and access and steal from so whether
[32:22] that's somebody is like hackers even
[32:26] very sophisticated hackers like from
[32:28] North Korea or a government that decides
[32:31] that it's going to Outlaw Bitcoin this
[32:34] happened in in the United States they
[32:36] actually outlawed they made it illegal
[32:39] to hold gold as an
[32:42] individual and so all the gold that was
[32:44] stored in Banks was forcibly converted
[32:47] into dollars and the government seized
[32:51] all the gold and brought it to its own
[32:53] faults this could happen again with
[32:56] Bitcoin if the majority of Bitcoin is
[32:58] sitting on exchanges and so I think that
[33:02] um it can be a systemic risk to bitcoin
[33:05] to to have most of it sitting with
[33:08] custodians just because it's very
[33:09] identifiable where it is at that
[33:11] point the I think it's also systemically
[33:15] risky
[33:16] for the broader Financial system for our
[33:21] country and when I say our country I
[33:23] mean the us but other countries around
[33:25] the world too and I think that's because
[33:28] it just continues building on the
[33:30] existing Legacy system that we have with
[33:34] the Banking and Financial system and
[33:37] like I was saying earlier we've had to
[33:39] build so many regulations and guardrails
[33:41] around this to protect against systemic
[33:43] risk because of all the conflicts of
[33:46] interests that are inherent throughout
[33:49] that system and so it's actually
[33:52] people's best interest
[33:54] to exit that system through self- custom
[33:58] and to do that not just for yourself but
[34:01] for the system as a whole to make sure
[34:03] that Bitcoin as a monetary system
[34:06] evolves correctly and doesn't just
[34:09] rebuild what we've already built and are
[34:11] trying to replace or or significantly
[34:14] improve with the Legacy Financial system
[34:16] if you watch or listen to my podcast on
[34:19] a regular basis I guess you already
[34:21] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[34:23] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[34:27] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[34:29] personal recommendation for Hardware
[34:31] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[34:34] it's simple to set up it's also perfect
[34:36] gift for a friend who has still their
[34:38] Bitcoin on an exchange and you can get a
[34:41] 5% discount with the code Robin at the
[34:44] checkout visit bitbox dos Swiss robobin
[34:49] to get your bitbox and if you really
[34:51] want to bulletproof your self custody
[34:54] setup your security setup and maybe even
[34:56] your citizenship set up you have to talk
[34:59] to the Bitcoin way if you go to the
[35:02] Bitcoin way.com
[35:04] Partners Robin you get a 30 minute free
[35:08] call where you can dive deep with them
[35:11] if your self custody setup is secure if
[35:14] your citizenship is secure or maybe
[35:17] might be improvable or your digital
[35:19] footprint in general is secure they are
[35:23] the experts in cyber security in Bitcoin
[35:26] self custody and how how to be a secure
[35:29] sovereign individual in general and last
[35:32] but not least I have something
[35:34] completely new for you guys I partnered
[35:37] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[35:40] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[35:43] saw created by anyone look at that
[35:46] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[35:49] made and perfect Bitcoin watch that's
[35:52] the perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[35:55] there and show that you are a bitco
[35:57] coiner and that watch brand is Bitcoin
[36:00] only make sure to check out the link in
[36:03] the description for this amazing coin
[36:05] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[36:08] amazing I love them so much it was
[36:10] really hard for me to pick the one that
[36:12] I want to have because there are a lot
[36:14] of great options I went with the new
[36:17] transparency Edition they're all limited
[36:20] so grab yours those will not be
[36:22] available for a long time but there will
[36:24] come new models and new amazing designs
[36:27] along the way I love that a lot really
[36:29] really cool do do you see uh the ETF uh
[36:32] with with coin Bas I think most of the
[36:34] ETFs hel hold their Bitcoin with ETFs
[36:37] with with coinbase uh and it's it's a
[36:40] it's a quite a good amount of Bitcoin
[36:42] that they already accumulated uh in not
[36:44] even the first year do you see that as a
[36:47] potential honeybot that might be I think
[36:50] it could not be a systemic risk to
[36:52] bitcoin because it's not enough Bitcoin
[36:54] at this point but could it be an major
[36:57] medium short-term uh event that is bad
[37:00] for Bitcoin yeah for sure I mean even
[37:03] the US government thinks that this could
[37:05] be a systemic risk to bitcoin the FBI
[37:08] put out like a notice two days ago or
[37:10] yesterday one of the two that was
[37:12] basically saying they are aware of
[37:15] sophisticated State actors from North
[37:17] Korea targeting ETF issuers and
[37:21] custodians and it was part of a broader
[37:24] kind of bulletin where they were saying
[37:27] you you know they're targeting
[37:28] individuals and other types of
[37:29] Institutions as well but they
[37:31] specifically list the ETF
[37:34] participants as part of the targets
[37:36] which makes sense because it's a giant
[37:38] Honeypot sitting there at
[37:39] coinbase and so of course coinbase has a
[37:43] lot of security precautions built in
[37:46] they've got um a lot of different ways
[37:49] that they're trying to prevent
[37:51] sophisticated hackers and social
[37:53] Engineers from accessing that but it's
[37:55] still a real risk and in a lot of ways
[37:58] security is a whack-a-mole game where
[38:02] you know the attackers and Defenders are
[38:05] always jockeying back and forth and
[38:08] trying to get a oneup on the other and
[38:12] you can look at just the ongoing stream
[38:17] of zero day vulnerabilities we get a few
[38:20] every year where core systems like
[38:23] iPhones MacBooks Google Chrome Windows
[38:27] computer computers etc are are uh
[38:30] exploited with a vulnerability that
[38:32] hasn't been found or known which is why
[38:36] it's called a zero day since it was
[38:39] created and it comes out apple or
[38:44] Microsoft or whoever patches it as fast
[38:46] as possible and maybe it gets uh
[38:49] exploited in the wild maybe
[38:51] not if some of these things happen with
[38:54] some of the big custodians that is a way
[38:57] that that the attackers win that game or
[39:00] score a point in that game and maybe
[39:02] they get all the Bitcoin maybe they only
[39:04] get some of the Bitcoin but either way
[39:06] it's bad for Bitcoin and
[39:08] so I was thinking about this a little
[39:11] bit earlier today actually and I was
[39:14] thinking about uh kind of a metaphor
[39:17] it's like what a custodian or what
[39:20] coinbase is doing with all the Bitcoin
[39:22] is they're building this
[39:25] castle and they're building all these
[39:28] layers of walls around this castle and
[39:31] then they've got little gates in each
[39:33] wall that you can get through in order
[39:35] to move Bitcoin in and out of this
[39:39] Castle but it's still just one castle
[39:43] and you just need to figure out how to
[39:45] get through all the gates properly or
[39:48] climb the walls or whatever it is and
[39:50] then you can get what's inside the
[39:52] castle whereas a model like Casa you
[39:56] have
[39:58] Casa sitting at the center building
[40:01] software but there's no Bitcoin sitting
[40:04] with Casa and then you can just draw all
[40:06] these lines out to each of kasa's
[40:08] customers which are their own mini
[40:10] castle that have their own walls
[40:12] protecting them and a smaller amount of
[40:15] Bitcoin sitting there and each of those
[40:18] targets is just much less juicy for the
[40:22] effort that you have to put in in order
[40:24] to compromise it the juice isn't worth
[40:26] the squeeze and so when you distribute
[40:29] the risk like that you create a bunch of
[40:33] individual castles all across the
[40:35] countryside to carry the metaphor
[40:37] slightly too far and end up in a
[40:40] scenario where it's a lot harder to
[40:42] compromise a very large amount of
[40:44] Bitcoin and so the systemic risk to the
[40:47] Bitcoin system is just so much lower and
[40:50] so anything we can do to drive towards
[40:52] that future versus that future where
[40:55] we're centralizing everything with a
[40:56] couple of Riders and we have to protect
[40:59] that with our life is I think a much
[41:02] better type of situation and future that
[41:04] we want to live in it's an amazing uh
[41:07] metaphor i l that a lot it's also shows
[41:11] um like banking it they're all castles
[41:15] basically like you hear it so many times
[41:17] that a bank account got hacked because
[41:19] yeah it's like a centralized entity uh
[41:21] and and sometimes it's really uh maybe
[41:24] even easy to to guess someone's password
[41:26] or like to get the two fact notification
[41:29] like uh Banks like it's it's so
[41:32] interesting when people asking oh how
[41:33] can you sleep with all the Bitcoin like
[41:35] I'm like how can you sleep with a bank
[41:37] account that has more than I don't know
[41:39] 5,000 or 10,000 EUR on it like I could
[41:41] not sleep with that that that would
[41:43] freak me out um but when we come to that
[41:46] metaphor and we have a society where
[41:48] there's not like big castles everywhere
[41:51] where a lot of big honey pots are but
[41:53] there is like way smaller castles and
[41:56] very distributed uh castles with line
[42:00] between each other like there are of
[42:02] course dependencies but they they the
[42:05] own castles um like a casa and their
[42:08] client because the client has at any
[42:10] time the ability to move the Bitcoin
[42:12] without kasa's help uh and and Kasa has
[42:16] basically no control over their castle
[42:19] castle Casa uh um what will that do to
[42:24] um humanity and society when we move
[42:27] from a a centralized system where we are
[42:31] used to someone else takes care of our
[42:34] things to we are taking care of our own
[42:37] things with help of of someone else
[42:41] still but we are
[42:43] decentralizing the
[42:45] responsibility because um even a uh I
[42:48] mean Kasa makes a great job in in in
[42:52] making it failure proof but if a client
[42:55] really wants to he can make mistake so
[42:57] like the responsibility is still on on
[42:59] on on the client side uh what will that
[43:02] do to to humanity and
[43:04] Society I think if you look at a lot of
[43:07] scenarios in humanity when you give
[43:11] people more
[43:13] responsibility they improve the quality
[43:17] of how they act maybe this is most
[43:20] applicable in kids for example like when
[43:25] you're with somebody else else's kids
[43:28] you don't have responsibility for them
[43:30] you feel like you know it's it's okay
[43:34] right but when it's your kids and you
[43:37] have responsibility for raising them
[43:40] protecting them making sure they turn
[43:41] out to be good humans the amount that
[43:45] you care goes up
[43:47] significantly or when you're in a
[43:49] workplace situation and you're just
[43:52] being told what to do all day and
[43:54] somebody else makes all the decisions
[43:56] you don't really care you're just kind
[43:58] of punching in and out but when you give
[44:01] somebody responsibility you allow them
[44:03] to make decisions over things themselves
[44:07] suddenly the quality of their work how
[44:09] much they actually care goes up
[44:13] significantly and
[44:15] so there's something ingrained in us as
[44:19] humans that when we feel like we
[44:21] actually own something we care about it
[44:24] more
[44:26] and money is one of the most important
[44:28] things in our lives as humans because we
[44:32] use it to sustain ourselves we use it to
[44:35] keep ourselves alive to fill our needs
[44:38] to fill our wants it helps it's you know
[44:41] the oil of society basically and of
[44:43] capitalism and so making people
[44:46] responsible for that or or giving them
[44:48] the option to be responsible for that I
[44:50] think changes how people think about
[44:53] their money and changes how people value
[44:55] their money and and then this spreads
[44:59] Beyond just money right so private Keys
[45:03] give you the ability to actually own
[45:07] data so in the case of Bitcoin that data
[45:10] is just your money um but that could be
[45:14] your online identity like on Noster it
[45:17] could be your content like on Noster it
[45:20] could be Communications like over
[45:22] encrypted communication apps like signal
[45:26] or proton or whatever it is it could be
[45:28] your personal files and so all these
[45:33] things can be made better and put into
[45:37] people's control for the first time ever
[45:40] thanks to cryptography and private keys
[45:43] and I think that that really changes how
[45:46] people think about their responsibility
[45:48] it really changes how people value a
[45:51] thing and it and it allows them to
[45:53] actually protect it themselves for the
[45:55] first time ever and so
[45:57] that to me a more responsible autonomous
[46:02] Society where we rely Less on somebody
[46:04] who's just telling us you know do this
[46:07] do this do this or who just goes off and
[46:09] handles all the things for us and is
[46:11] more like helping us to make the right
[46:15] decisions around how we secure what
[46:17] matters most to us I think that's a a
[46:19] good better Evolution for society than
[46:23] than what we've had so far it's very
[46:24] intangible right like it's a it's kind
[46:26] of a vague idea we haven't seen it come
[46:30] to full fruition so it's kind of hard to
[46:32] say you know this is exactly how people
[46:35] are going to act I think I I'm not
[46:37] always a huge fan of like the the
[46:39] Bitcoin fixes this meme where it's like
[46:41] you know if you fix this one thing with
[46:44] the money that's going to spiral out to
[46:46] fix every single problem the world has I
[46:49] I don't buy into that but I do think
[46:52] that there's subtle impacts from doing
[46:54] that and that it can help people live a
[46:58] better life and one where they feel like
[47:00] they have more control and
[47:01] responsibility which overall improves
[47:04] the quality of life and how much they
[47:06] care about those
[47:07] things I have an amazing andrine
[47:10] question for you because in tin we have
[47:12] a question from the previous guest uh
[47:14] that that fits so nicely in but I will
[47:16] keep it for the end routine um I had uh
[47:19] two days ago a podcast where someone
[47:21] said a quote to me that I just wrote
[47:24] down and it is so nice and I I put it up
[47:26] because I don't want to mess this up so
[47:27] I will read it to you a kid that isn't
[47:29] allowed to do anything will be an adult
[47:31] that doesn't do anything I love that so
[47:34] much and he brought it up also in
[47:36] Bitcoin perspective and I think that's
[47:38] what you're also talking about where
[47:40] when where where when we get the control
[47:43] back this this allows Society really to
[47:46] to thrive again and I love also your
[47:48] anology not only with money uh so with
[47:51] Bitcoin giving the control back to it
[47:53] but it has the possibilities to give us
[47:56] with Nostra our social media accounts
[47:58] back because all of the sudden nost is a
[48:00] protocol and you can take your followers
[48:02] your connections your whatever you want
[48:04] to call it a back and you really can uh
[48:09] own it and not the clients or not damos
[48:12] or not any other nostal client owns it
[48:15] which is an amazing thing as as a
[48:17] content creator I can say it's like it's
[48:19] a hustle to build on YouTube then on X
[48:22] and then on Rumble and then on all other
[48:23] platforms all at the same time and you
[48:25] have to produce one video and you upload
[48:27] it to five different platforms and those
[48:30] platforms distribute it further it's a
[48:32] it's a hustle um so that's an amazing
[48:36] thing and I think the the most
[48:38] significant amount that that I always
[48:39] thinking of with with data sharing is
[48:42] also medical data for example when I'm
[48:44] like okay I should own my medical data
[48:47] and the the the uh doctors should ask me
[48:51] oh can you share that data with me then
[48:53] temporarily I share it with him not he
[48:55] has a file on me and I have to ask him
[48:57] like
[48:58] hey what is in my file so like there are
[49:01] a lot of uh trickle down effects from uh
[49:05] that from that Revolution and uh
[49:08] obviously I think money is the biggest
[49:10] one from all of them uh but from that we
[49:13] we can move forward and move in so many
[49:16] small and different ways forward I love
[49:18] that analogy so thank you for that cool
[49:20] cool Co input of yours yeah of course I
[49:24] I definitely agree and I think that um
[49:28] it's it's interesting like anybody who
[49:31] builds consumer products I think runs
[49:33] into scenarios where you just see people
[49:37] acting in ways that actually that's kind
[49:40] of a weird tangent we can I'm not going
[49:41] to go down that tangent we can cut that
[49:43] out I but anyway it's it's like I think
[49:48] it's interesting to me but it's probably
[49:49] not very applicable so never mind no no
[49:52] worries no worries it happens to me all
[49:55] the time I have a pH I'm like oh [ __ ] I
[49:58] should have fought that in then one one
[50:01] thing that um there are a few more
[50:03] things that I want to go through but uh
[50:06] one thing that I'm interested in is uh
[50:10] future threet models to uh all of that I
[50:14] think a lot of people are also
[50:15] interested in in okay what is the Fret
[50:17] model of of maybe AI doing to uh Bitcoin
[50:23] uh on my C solution because AI I like
[50:27] for example I'm a high high user of chat
[50:29] gbt it it helps with the podcast
[50:32] business so much like from writing tags
[50:36] that are optimized for search engine
[50:37] optimization from writing
[50:39] descriptions uh and and I have people on
[50:42] like oh how do you write all those great
[50:44] descriptions for your podcast I'm like I
[50:47] don't what what AI does that like how is
[50:50] that possible uh and I just like
[50:53] consented now to jbt I think they roll
[50:55] it out today at least for my computer
[50:58] where they can learn now from each chat
[51:00] and they combining that information from
[51:02] from you so like one chat is not uh that
[51:06] um how dangerous of a threat model do
[51:09] you see it when AI is taking over the
[51:11] computer it's like apple has their own
[51:13] AI build in uh and basically you can
[51:16] just like Hey Siri uh what is that and
[51:19] they have all the information about you
[51:21] what what what you plugged in if you
[51:23] plugged in an ubk didn't know all of
[51:25] those things um do do you see that as a
[51:28] as a POS Potential Threat model to self
[51:32] custody and do we have to maybe in the
[51:34] future even go to like air gaped things
[51:37] and and and go a little bit further down
[51:40] the the security route to get it away
[51:43] from the machines to make it more secure
[51:45] how do you how do you see that's a great
[51:46] question I think so there's a couple of
[51:49] things that I think are important to
[51:51] think about with threat modeling on the
[51:53] AI perspective so um the
[51:57] to go specifically to the question that
[51:59] you were just talking
[52:00] about I don't think we're there yet
[52:03] today like I I don't think that we're in
[52:05] a point where the AI is going to be able
[52:08] to steal your private key out of the
[52:11] secure element on your phone or
[52:12] something like that I think um it's
[52:17] there's a level of trust I think that
[52:18] people are putting into apple or some of
[52:21] the the companies that are building with
[52:23] AI to and the companies that build the
[52:26] hardware and the secure elements and
[52:28] that kind of thing to not open up those
[52:32] secure elements and open up attack
[52:33] vectors that then the the AI can utilize
[52:36] that's the whole point of a secure
[52:38] element on a phone right it's like this
[52:40] is a separate chip that can only has
[52:42] very strict permissioning around it in
[52:45] order to utilize the the encryption and
[52:49] decryption capabilities so I think that
[52:54] for now we can probably trust that that
[52:58] will continue to be handled in the way
[53:01] that it should be I think um if we get
[53:04] to a point where we have like ASI
[53:07] artificial super intelligence or
[53:09] something like that then that might be
[53:12] something that we have to consider a
[53:14] little bit more and understand what are
[53:16] the the safeguards that have been put in
[53:17] around what this can access within your
[53:20] system and if there if the safeguards
[53:23] aren't very clearly strong enough then
[53:27] yeah it probably makes sense to move
[53:29] towards more of an air gapped model and
[53:32] so that's something that you can do with
[53:34] Casa today I think that's a future that
[53:35] we're we're totally down to live in and
[53:39] build for
[53:41] and it'll it'll all just be about making
[53:45] like the right balance I guess between
[53:48] Simplicity and security and so you you
[53:51] have to think about
[53:52] okay there's going to be a portion of my
[53:55] Bitcoin that I want more ready access to
[53:58] that I want to spend more regularly for
[54:00] that I'm willing to keep it on a less
[54:02] secure device and a less secure setup
[54:04] then there's going to be like my main
[54:06] savings and for that I want to have it
[54:08] in a much more secure setup
[54:11] multisig potentially air gapped all
[54:14] those things and so you can kind of
[54:16] build up that security model for
[54:18] yourself based on the threat vectors
[54:20] that you're seeing and I think that with
[54:23] AI it's something that we really got to
[54:25] pay close attention to to and when it
[54:28] gets smarter really evaluate whether we
[54:31] need to shift model to where private
[54:33] keys are only held on like dumb devices
[54:35] and never leave the device basically um
[54:38] the other thing that I think is
[54:39] important with AI is just
[54:43] that AI is getting better and better at
[54:45] copying humans and one of the things
[54:49] that really gets a lot of people today
[54:51] so everybody worries about these
[54:53] catastrophic events right like people
[54:55] are worried about the artificial
[54:57] superintelligence stealing everybody's
[54:59] Bitcoin people are worried about the uh
[55:04] hack of coinbase where all the Bitcoin
[55:06] goes away at once because they breached
[55:09] the walls and got
[55:10] in what's actually probably the biggest
[55:13] and most practical threat right now is
[55:17] individual social engineering and
[55:19] fishing where tons of people are trying
[55:24] to spending their time trying to hack
[55:27] individuals who are kind of unsuspecting
[55:30] today and so that job gets way easier
[55:34] with AI where you can use AI to help you
[55:38] sound more like somebody and to help
[55:41] build up a story that helps you to
[55:44] socially engineer some someone else and
[55:47] use that to get access to their Bitcoin
[55:50] and so there's some pretty sophisticated
[55:52] stuff happening already today without
[55:54] the help of AI and now you add in the
[55:56] ability for AI to impersonate somebody's
[55:58] family impersonate somebody for a Sim
[56:00] swap in order to pass voice recognition
[56:03] I actually was just talking to somebody
[56:04] else today where they got it was the CEO
[56:07] they were talking about somebody they
[56:08] knew who was the CEO of a large company
[56:11] and they got Sim swapped because the
[56:14] attacker used AI to impersonate their
[56:17] voice and pass the voice checks that the
[56:20] phone company had in place and so that's
[56:23] something that um you know AI as a tool
[56:27] to impersonate is only is only getting
[56:30] stronger and I think that is much more
[56:33] real in the short term than like the
[56:36] super intelligence that goes and steals
[56:38] everything from us so the way to protect
[56:41] against that is actually through
[56:43] cryptography because you can verify
[56:47] authenticity verify that somebody is who
[56:50] they say they are using private key
[56:53] private public key cry cryptography
[56:55] which is the one thing that today an AI
[56:57] can't break because it would take all
[56:59] the computing power in the world
[57:00] millions of years to break one private
[57:03] public key pair and so I think that's a
[57:05] really interesting component of this
[57:08] that actually in the war against
[57:11] impersonation by AI cryptography is our
[57:14] best weapon and so that's something that
[57:17] we're thinking a lot about at Casa and
[57:19] that I think we're going to see more of
[57:23] in how people build out their security
[57:25] model going forward that's a really
[57:26] interesting thought uh because all of a
[57:29] sudden you can imitate someone's voice I
[57:32] mean to a certain extent even this video
[57:34] and those things are just starting to
[57:36] develop like we we're just starting to
[57:38] see those voices and those videos of of
[57:42] of people and the images and uh the the
[57:46] right now the the EI memes of like
[57:49] politicians with Trump and camela and El
[57:52] musk and and then uh they robbing a bank
[57:55] like that meme I think go really Ral uh
[57:58] it's really interesting to to see and
[58:00] funny to see those memes but it shows
[58:03] that we are at the starting of
[58:05] impersonating basically everyone and for
[58:08] someone like me that's really scary
[58:10] because I have so much training data
[58:13] publicly available like I have literally
[58:16] like now what
[58:18] 237 podcasts so everyone around one hour
[58:22] to two hours that's a lot of training
[58:24] data to make a really
[58:26] impressive looking Robin S that can uh
[58:30] be maybe uh yeah basically saying
[58:33] exactly how I say it and and do it and
[58:36] interesting enough like Riverside offers
[58:38] that feature the Riverside platform
[58:39] where we are recording right now to
[58:41] voice clone myself so I can actually
[58:45] make advertisement announcement and
[58:47] stuff like that only voice of course um
[58:50] with that and I tried that feature out
[58:53] uh and I typed in text and I send it uh
[58:56] to to my girlfriend and she thought I
[58:59] was it like she was tricked by by that
[59:02] voice message so I think the the the the
[59:06] things that we can already do are really
[59:09] scary where to this point uh where your
[59:12] romantic partner on a quick voice me
[59:16] message on a WhatsApp doesn't know like
[59:18] oh he's not him like that that that
[59:21] voice sounds weird no that voice
[59:23] actually is not him but you don't
[59:25] recognize it like the the possibilities
[59:27] of that are like endless it's it's
[59:29] really interesting has has little to
[59:31] know to do with with Bitcoin but I think
[59:33] it's a really interesting future that we
[59:36] that we going through really interesting
[59:38] to talk about that yeah I mean the and
[59:40] the thing about it is like you don't
[59:43] want to not have that tool right like
[59:45] it's actually very useful to be able to
[59:49] uh clone yourself and test out a bunch
[59:51] of different kinds of ads without having
[59:53] to record every single version of it
[59:55] then you can can see what resonates the
[59:57] best and maybe you go back and record
[59:58] that version make it perfect quality or
[60:00] whatever it is there's a lot of ways
[60:03] that AI being able to impersonate people
[60:06] is going to be incredibly helpful for us
[60:09] as a tool to run businesses but it's
[60:12] also going to have it's going to be
[60:14] helpful for people that are are looking
[60:16] to do criminal things and so we need to
[60:17] have protections there that um we can
[60:21] put in place and new societal norms and
[60:25] behaviors that people can adopt in order
[60:28] to protect against the the new threats
[60:30] that come with that really interesting
[60:32] um before we come closer to the outine
[60:34] uh do you have any um future things that
[60:38] you can say like the those things will
[60:41] be developed uh on Cara or is the main
[60:44] agenda just to make uh self- custody
[60:48] more user friendly and more secure over
[60:51] time or do you plan to go other avenues
[60:55] a little bit with like what we discussed
[60:57] maybe with Bitcoin Banks but then
[60:58] there's this problem of like having to
[61:00] KC the customers it's I just thought
[61:03] about that is there anything like that
[61:05] that that you can share yeah so nothing
[61:10] really specific to share today but we um
[61:16] we've got some good stuff cooking that
[61:18] I'm excited about a lot of the near-term
[61:20] stuff is just how do we make self-
[61:22] custody easier for different types of
[61:24] people that is a big very big problem in
[61:27] itself to work on and I think that's
[61:29] something that we're we're just highly
[61:31] focused on which is why in my very
[61:34] humble and unbiased opinion were the
[61:35] best way to self custody on the
[61:38] market that said the broader vision of
[61:42] Casa and the broader story has always
[61:44] about been about what private keys can
[61:46] do for Humanity and how can we use
[61:49] private keys to enable people like we
[61:53] were talking about earlier to be more
[61:56] more autonomous to have more control
[61:58] over the things that matter most to them
[62:00] and to take on that responsibility
[62:03] without it feeling like a burden with it
[62:05] actually where it feels like something
[62:07] that they want to do that's exciting and
[62:09] that lets them live a better life and
[62:13] so that's what we're really thinking
[62:15] about over the long term and then we um
[62:19] you know in in the path to get there
[62:21] what we're really focused on is how do
[62:24] we make uh security
[62:27] simple and then how do we make security
[62:31] simple not just for your Bitcoin but for
[62:34] you as a bitcoiner and so I I was
[62:36] talking about this a little bit at the
[62:38] when we announced the UB key feature on
[62:40] stage at Nashville
[62:43] but people who own Bitcoin
[62:47] bitcoiners they do need to think about
[62:50] the security of their Bitcoin but they
[62:51] also need to think about security of
[62:54] other areas of their life and a lot of
[62:56] people don't know the steps to take here
[62:58] and so we're really thinking uh about
[63:01] how do we help people do this in a way
[63:04] that is approachable in a way that help
[63:06] helps them be secure that doesn't take
[63:09] tons and tons of time on their end but
[63:12] gets like the easy stuff out of the way
[63:15] gets like a lot of the basics done so
[63:17] that you just become a more difficult
[63:20] Target
[63:21] for a random attacker it's kind of like
[63:25] making yourself
[63:26] it's like if two people are running from
[63:28] the bear you just want to be faster than
[63:30] the other person and so when Casa thinks
[63:33] about how do we offer not just Bitcoin
[63:36] security we want to offer security for
[63:38] bitcoiners we're trying to help you be
[63:39] the faster person and all these
[63:41] different areas of your life that then
[63:43] ties back to securing your Bitcoin so
[63:47] this is something that we're we're
[63:49] working on right now we've got some good
[63:51] stuff coming on that and on a couple of
[63:53] other fronts that I'm excited about and
[63:55] and you'll hear more soon really really
[63:58] cool thank you for sharing that with us
[64:00] um one question before the end te uh
[64:02] that I kind of have to ask as a Bitcoin
[64:04] only podcast why support
[64:07] ethereum yeah good question we just had
[64:11] so many of our customers saying hey I
[64:13] really like storing my Bitcoin with Casa
[64:14] can I store my ethereum with you
[64:17] too um and then I think that stable
[64:21] coins are also providing a a service for
[64:23] people and there's really no stable
[64:27] coins running on Bitcoin today and so
[64:29] I'd love to see stable coins running on
[64:30] bitcoin but there's a lot of people
[64:32] using stable coins practically around
[64:35] the world and I think that uh that was
[64:38] intriguing for us as well so it was just
[64:42] came down to what our customers were
[64:45] asking us for and um we remain a Bitcoin
[64:49] first company and a very Bitcoin focused
[64:52] company if you look at the things that
[64:54] we have done since
[64:56] releasing the support for ethereum all
[64:59] of them are things that are very
[65:01] beneficial for bitcoiners and so we
[65:05] continue to believe that Bitcoin is the
[65:08] most important asset out of the
[65:10] ecosystem that's where we want to spend
[65:12] all of our time and so I think you you
[65:17] uh we said that we were going to do that
[65:19] when we first announced ethereum and
[65:21] people were kind of like yeah sure
[65:23] whatever like you're probably going to
[65:25] add next or whatever um and you can see
[65:29] by our actions since then that
[65:31] everything we have done and built has
[65:33] been to help bitcoiners so I hope that
[65:35] some of the like proof is in the pudding
[65:37] is now out there from a track record
[65:40] perspective over the last year and helps
[65:42] people understand what we're really
[65:44] focused on yeah is really interesting I
[65:47] mean I have a lot of guests on that uh
[65:50] not only hold Bitcoin like it's not a
[65:52] complete Bitcoin Maxi show I even have a
[65:54] lot of guests that hold other
[65:56] cryptocurrencies even outside of
[65:58] ethereum it just happens to be that I
[66:00] personally am Bitcoin only uh and it's
[66:04] interesting that with the podcast I
[66:07] transitioned to way more of uh a soft
[66:12] Bitcoin max if if you you say like I was
[66:15] way more toxic if at the time where I
[66:19] was just on a and just putting out my
[66:21] tweets then I'm doing it right now
[66:24] because uh
[66:26] even if like I have the I have the thing
[66:30] where I'm like okay it's Bitcoin only I
[66:32] don't see any use Cas in other other
[66:33] altcoins but I'm aware of that I'm just
[66:36] one human being and I could be flawed
[66:38] and um no matter what's the outcome the
[66:42] free market will make the decision
[66:45] anyways like if if exactly if if if bit
[66:48] if etherum has absolutely no use case I
[66:52] don't have to worry about that because
[66:53] then people will flock out of ethereum
[66:56] and will only have bit Bitcoin one
[66:59] question I have to to that any uh more
[67:02] is there any technical uh difference
[67:06] between storing Bitcoin uh and storing
[67:09] ethereum is is is it basically I have no
[67:12] clue about ethereum that's why I'm
[67:13] asking is there any any technical
[67:16] difference in in storing
[67:17] ethereum well from a user-facing
[67:20] perspective we tried to make it feel
[67:23] very similar but under the hood it's
[67:25] actually
[67:26] wildly different how the different
[67:29] protocols work because they both handle
[67:30] multisig very differently and so we
[67:34] actually built them to be pretty
[67:36] separate in our system so that the like
[67:40] we I think we could have compromised on
[67:42] things and tried to like smush it all
[67:45] together and make it like you know not
[67:50] to separate security systems and in that
[67:53] case might have actually degraded the
[67:56] the benefits of securing Bitcoin with
[67:57] Casa and we took the approach of saying
[68:00] no we want the Bitcoin security to
[68:03] remain Rock Solid and to not be affected
[68:05] At All by us adding support for ethereum
[68:09] and so in order to do that we had to
[68:10] build it in a way that we kept them very
[68:13] separate and just built based on how the
[68:17] native protocols work and so that means
[68:19] that they work pretty differently under
[68:21] the hood but as a user for the most part
[68:23] you don't really have to to think about
[68:26] that there's like a couple of scenarios
[68:28] where it works slightly differently in
[68:31] the UI uh when you're taking different
[68:33] actions but overall it you know it
[68:36] doesn't make a ton of difference it it
[68:38] all kind of comes down to what's
[68:40] happening underneath that surface so um
[68:45] we've just tried to be very careful
[68:47] about making sure that the ethereum
[68:49] support doesn't affect the security for
[68:51] the Bitcoin side of things and I think
[68:53] that that's that's worked out well for
[68:55] us
[68:56] um and yeah I agree that ultimately it's
[68:59] like a it's a free market thing
[69:01] because just because we support ethereum
[69:04] doesn't mean that somebody chooses to
[69:05] invest in ethereum
[69:08] and um we take no stance on like you
[69:12] whether we're in a Bitcoin Maxi or
[69:14] ethereum Maxi or whatever like Jameson
[69:16] my co-founder loves to [ __ ] on ethereum
[69:20] on Twitter or X and that's fine like
[69:25] fine but he also realizes that we got a
[69:27] bunch of customers that want to store
[69:29] their ether with Casa and so that's as a
[69:32] business it just that's what we decided
[69:34] to do and so um I think that the free
[69:39] market it's it's a very free markets are
[69:41] a very Bitcoin aligned principle right
[69:45] and so just like you said if Bitcoin
[69:48] gets more adoption then ethereum it's
[69:51] going to outperform as an asset and what
[69:54] we've seen this year is significant
[69:56] outperformance from of Bitcoin versus
[69:58] ethereum as an asset and um so I think
[70:03] that that's the free market at work
[70:05] we'll see if that changes but in the
[70:07] meantime it's not our job our job to
[70:08] tell our customers what they can and
[70:10] can't invest in it's just our job to
[70:12] respond to our customer security
[70:14] needs yeah as a as a company you're here
[70:17] to serve I get that a lot really really
[70:19] cool um also like from a performance
[70:22] performance of Bitcoin in ethereum uh
[70:24] the one metric that I track always with
[70:28] Bitcoin versus ethereum is the metric
[70:31] starting when they switched from proof
[70:33] of work to proof of stake and it's
[70:35] really interesting since it did it it
[70:37] was like 2020 uh I forgot the month but
[70:40] I think it was in the middle or end of
[70:42] 20202 um where they they switched from
[70:45] proof work to proof of stake and since
[70:47] then it actually um what was it was
[70:50] Bitcoin going up 50% against it or was
[70:53] ethereum going down 50% I I forgot but
[70:56] at least like the the difference between
[70:59] the Bitcoin and the ethereum price is
[71:01] significant since then like Bitcoin has
[71:04] performed so much better since ethereum
[71:07] switched um I have as as I said like I
[71:10] have no clue why this this because like
[71:12] i' I'm not in an a at all uh I only know
[71:16] why Bitcoin will be going up in the long
[71:19] term I have a whole podcast around that
[71:22] but uh ethereum it's it's interesting a
[71:25] AI switch dead
[71:27] system and whether the proof of work
[71:29] versus proof of stake is what did it or
[71:31] something else like you know there's a
[71:33] lot of different reasons why Bitcoin
[71:35] could outperform eth I think that uh
[71:38] ethereum has a lot more competitors like
[71:42] there's a bunch of different chains out
[71:45] there trying to be the smart contract
[71:47] Computing chain for Bitcoin it's done a
[71:51] pretty good job of winning that money
[71:54] use case
[71:56] and so I think that uh that's a you know
[72:00] a big difference from like a if you
[72:03] think about it almost from like a
[72:04] product Market fit perspective and a a
[72:06] marketing perspective of like is this
[72:09] clearly the best thing for this use case
[72:11] and I think bitcoin's just really nailed
[72:14] that for money really cool uh as we're
[72:17] coming closer to the end um even though
[72:19] there there's so many really interesting
[72:21] conversation with you um the one
[72:24] question that asked all my guests in the
[72:26] end is what can we learn from all
[72:28] besides all the things uh about the
[72:31] Bitcoin topics wait let me say that
[72:33] again I completely made failed that
[72:37] now I think it was not even
[72:39] understandable what can we learn from
[72:41] you besides all the topics that we
[72:43] already talked about in Bitcoin so I
[72:46] think probably one of the lessons that
[72:48] you can learn from and just my
[72:50] experience as a person is that you don't
[72:53] have to be this
[72:56] perfect like the word specimens coming
[72:59] to mind but that's not quite right you
[73:02] don't have to be a perfect fit or like
[73:04] have the perfect plan for a certain type
[73:08] of role and so let me just be more
[73:10] specific to like add some clarity to
[73:12] that I was not the original CEO of Casa
[73:17] and I actually started my career doing
[73:20] Finance like something totally different
[73:22] than what I'm doing today and eventually
[73:25] decided I wanted to get into Tech and
[73:28] startups because I wanted to have more
[73:31] responsibility over what I was working
[73:33] on and what I was building and I took
[73:35] like a job just at a random Tech startup
[73:40] where I knew some of the people that
[73:42] were working there and I was working in
[73:44] operations so I it was a travel Tech
[73:47] startup where you um we would uh let you
[73:51] order food from your phone at the
[73:52] airport and so the first job that I took
[73:54] just to get into the tech world was in
[73:57] operations for them where I was going
[73:58] into airports and like physically
[74:01] installing effectively door Dash tablets
[74:04] so that people could order food from
[74:06] their phone and doing all the
[74:08] Integrations like overnight like pulling
[74:10] all nighter in airports doing these
[74:13] things and it was you know it was fun
[74:17] but it was nothing even close to like
[74:20] what I'm doing today
[74:23] but I kind of worked there in that role
[74:26] for a while and then moved over into
[74:28] doing product management for the same
[74:30] company and got that opportunity there
[74:33] thankfully to them and learned a bunch
[74:36] doing that and then kind of over and
[74:39] over again just made these little
[74:42] changes in my career and eventually
[74:44] ended up uh joining Casa as one of the
[74:47] early employees and as head of product
[74:50] and then I just tried to do good work at
[74:53] Casa and was really um you know
[74:57] passionate about the problem that we
[75:00] have been working on and then at the end
[75:02] of 2019 which was about a year and a
[75:05] half into me working at Casa um the
[75:08] previous CEO decided to step down there
[75:11] were some family health issues involved
[75:13] and he asked me to take over as CEO and
[75:15] I had no idea how to be a CEO and I was
[75:19] like totally feeling in over my head and
[75:23] only thanks to help from a couple of
[75:25] close friends and some of our investors
[75:28] was I able to figure out like what the
[75:30] heck I should do we almost ran out of
[75:34] money we had like not you know 30 days
[75:38] or 45 days of cash left basically when I
[75:40] took over as CEO it was a very difficult
[75:43] time for the company but we pulled
[75:46] together as a team and supported each
[75:48] other and we're made it through and and
[75:51] now are doing very well as a company and
[75:53] so I think when somebody like looks in
[75:56] from the outside maybe it's easy to feel
[76:00] like you know I could never do something
[76:02] like that but I think what it always
[76:04] boils down to
[76:06] is you can do these things you just have
[76:10] to try and you have to try your best to
[76:13] do a good job at something and out of
[76:16] that good things will come and so you
[76:19] know I every new employee that joins
[76:22] Casa I give them this uh culture talk
[76:27] basically and we talk through all the
[76:29] ways that we work at Casa what our
[76:31] values are what our mission is all that
[76:33] but the the very last slide that I have
[76:36] in my
[76:37] presentation is a slide that
[76:40] says uh who you will become is who you
[76:43] decide to be and this is something that
[76:46] has been has really been important to me
[76:50] as a person because it helps me remember
[76:53] that future me is just a it's just
[76:57] present me plus all of the decisions
[76:59] that I make between now and that
[77:02] whatever future point in time that I
[77:05] choose and I think that that's something
[77:07] that's very empowering in one hand and
[77:10] comforting in the other hand because yes
[77:13] there may be these kind of random curve
[77:15] balls that life throws at you but the
[77:17] the main constant in your life is you
[77:20] and the decisions that you make and so I
[77:22] think that that is a very like
[77:24] encouraging thing for me personally and
[77:27] if you had asked me back when I first
[77:29] took that job in operations at that Tech
[77:32] startup if I thought that I would be the
[77:35] CEO of a company of a size that Kasa is
[77:38] today I would not have believed it and
[77:42] so I think the lesson there is you can
[77:45] do whatever you want you just have to do
[77:47] the thing and then try hard at it I love
[77:50] that a lot thank you for sharing that
[77:52] that's beautiful um really cool we are
[77:54] already uh very close to the end of the
[77:58] podcast um the end routine of the
[78:02] podcast is where the previous guest is
[78:03] asking a question for the next guest
[78:05] without knowing who the next guest is
[78:07] and I already teased it before a little
[78:08] bit uh because you said Bitcoin doesn't
[78:11] solve anything it doesn't solve
[78:13] everything uh and it's interesting
[78:15] because your question from the previous
[78:17] guest is what do you think Bitcoin
[78:20] doesn't solve
[78:21] H yeah that is good tie in think uh this
[78:25] isn't going to be a great answer I think
[78:27] there's a lot of things that Bitcoin
[78:29] doesn't
[78:30] solve about human nature like I think
[78:34] that sometimes people say like suddenly
[78:36] Bitcoin is going to make us these like
[78:41] more
[78:42] altruistic beings with longer time
[78:45] preferences that are only thinking about
[78:47] the future and only like building for
[78:51] this glorious future not being selfish
[78:53] in the present
[78:56] Etc and I just think that that while
[79:00] that is true sometimes there's also just
[79:03] a lot of human nature that is built up
[79:06] around like what do I want right now
[79:09] what am I feeling right now how do I
[79:11] make sure I'm feeling good right now and
[79:16] Bitcoin can't fix that probably a lot of
[79:19] like Bitcoin plus like a lot of
[79:21] meditation and you know time spent
[79:24] analyzing your own psychology and the
[79:26] wisdom of life as you get older and
[79:28] older that's like the real recipe to to
[79:31] fix that but I don't think Bitcoin
[79:33] fundamentally changes who we are as
[79:37] people for in that really really deep
[79:40] way but I think it can be a tool to
[79:42] allow people to better Express who they
[79:45] are as people and it can be a tool to
[79:48] for the people that um you know want to
[79:51] take on more responsibility want that
[79:54] free Freedom want that autonomy that
[79:56] Bitcoin can provide and that
[79:58] cryptography can provide I think it's a
[80:01] it's a tool that they've never had
[80:02] before and so that enables some of those
[80:05] behaviors that um just haven't been
[80:08] practical or possible before but does it
[80:12] fundamentally change human nature and
[80:15] and turn you into this perfectly healthy
[80:19] eating um or only meat eating like
[80:23] longtime Horizon and Guru probably not I
[80:28] think a lot of that comes actually down
[80:30] to and I 100% agree with you uh a lot of
[80:33] that comes down because people are now
[80:35] coming at the community and we a really
[80:38] early community and a small community
[80:40] especially the Bitcoin only uh crowd and
[80:43] in that Community are a lot of people
[80:45] that have that low time Preference they
[80:48] are meditating they are looking out for
[80:50] their food they have all all those
[80:52] things going for them so I think when we
[80:54] have those kind of um people in that
[80:58] early Community uh and we have uh new
[81:02] people coming in they're influenced more
[81:04] by the community and less by by Bitcoin
[81:07] itself so I think a lot of that comes
[81:09] down to we are being in a very early
[81:11] community and not like oh yeah we have a
[81:14] different money and all of the sudden
[81:15] our brain functions differently I do
[81:17] think that bit s money does something to
[81:19] society but not to the extent that a lot
[81:22] of uh people think so that I think
[81:25] that's a great Insight also from you so
[81:26] a great answer uh from you thank you so
[81:30] much Nick for for being on today before
