[00:00] what is happening in America with the
[00:01] Trump Administration is going to send
[00:04] ripples across the world force people to
[00:06] start looking into how to onboard
[00:08] Bitcoin around summer
[00:10] 2023 a man announced that they they'
[00:13] invested about a billion dollars into
[00:15] mining infrastructure this shows you
[00:17] that nation states are actively getting
[00:19] involved in mining you can just see it
[00:20] by the hash rate there is a supply
[00:22] strock the amount of Bitcoins traded and
[00:24] openly traded compared to how much have
[00:26] been held by long-term holders how much
[00:28] is available nothing so really it won't
[00:32] require that much for it to move
[00:34] drastically up but there is because
[00:36] given it's it's a completely open free
[00:38] market Bitcoin doesn't rise like it did
[00:40] in the past but continues Rising that's
[00:42] how Bitcoin was intended designed to do
[00:45] that it's it's it's deflationary money
[00:47] your value is always going to rise over
[00:49] [Music]
[00:52] time what is kind
[00:55] of
[00:56] your uh overview or like what what are
[00:59] you you you currently seeing in in
[01:01] nation state adoption around the
[01:05] world well I think it's very important
[01:07] to to mention I mean you just talked
[01:10] about touched it is what is happening in
[01:12] America with the Trump Administration is
[01:14] going to send is sending ripples across
[01:18] the world for people to start looking
[01:21] into how to onboard Bitcoin the fact
[01:24] that the most powerful nation in the
[01:25] world is now adopting Bitcoin in as a
[01:29] strategic IC Reserve as a store of value
[01:32] is
[01:34] significant however having said that I
[01:37] think people aren't if I think it's not
[01:40] quite taking um it's not quite it's
[01:42] setting R it's sending ripples across
[01:44] the world but people aren't quite buying
[01:45] it quite yet I think the news is so much
[01:48] too bullish that you've seen how the
[01:50] price action hasn't been very bullish at
[01:51] all people almost selling the news given
[01:54] that it's one of the most bullish thing
[01:55] that's happened in Bitcoin but people
[01:57] are talking about it and those in the
[01:59] know like yourself like a lot of the
[02:02] viewers a lot of listeners here
[02:04] understand the gravity and how important
[02:06] such big news is and there are a lot of
[02:08] there's a lot of developments happening
[02:09] around the world that um that many
[02:12] bitcoiners are talking about and many uh
[02:14] Nations and and and and and individuals
[02:16] are talking about and it's really quite
[02:18] exciting times here at Jan 3 for example
[02:21] we are working on a few uh
[02:23] initiatives and few of them we don't
[02:26] want to speak can't really speak about
[02:27] but one of them that that's an
[02:28] interesting uh development is is in
[02:31] Thailand and we are look we are working
[02:35] with uh with with with Thailand quite
[02:36] closely with um to develop
[02:40] a so to speak a a Bitcoin sandbox like a
[02:44] like an area where where they can test
[02:45] out Bitcoin regulation there um another
[02:48] Bitcoin another Bitcoin Beach or jungle
[02:50] so to speak and to test out how they can
[02:53] uh how they how how Bitcoin regulation
[02:55] how how they can adopt Bitcoin as a
[02:57] medium of exchange and also as a store
[02:59] of value
[03:00] interesting so like it's uh it's kind of
[03:03] an area where Bitcoin adoption is tested
[03:06] out entirely exactly how Bitcoin is
[03:08] meant is is became into the spotlight in
[03:11] in El Salvador um El Salvador adopted
[03:14] Bitcoin thanks to the work that happened
[03:16] at Bitcoin Beach so this is how Bitcoin
[03:19] works it's it's a grassroot effort it's
[03:21] it's a bottomup effort um strategy and
[03:25] really it has to come from proven tested
[03:29] um a locations proving that it can
[03:31] actually work and this is an this is one
[03:34] of the strategies that we're that that
[03:35] tyon is is is trying to um employ as you
[03:39] probably know the the former prime
[03:40] minister of Thailand I forget his name
[03:42] he is uh I think was it tax taxing I
[03:45] believe and he he understands Bitcoin
[03:48] and we are turning to f fet as that sort
[03:52] of Bitcoin sandbox is a place to
[03:53] basically test it out and to prove if it
[03:57] can it can work which it will that it
[03:59] can then be then it can open the door
[04:01] for sort of broader adoption and a way
[04:05] of just showing Thailand showing the
[04:08] people that uh that Financial
[04:09] Empowerment is possible through Bitcoin
[04:12] um is that is
[04:16] it uh te uh texing shatra I
[04:22] believe I don't quote me on that one
[04:25] sorry I'm not I'm not good with names
[04:27] yeah
[04:30] uh yes sorry go ahead no I was just
[04:32] saying uh because the reason why
[04:34] Thailand is interesting is we have our
[04:35] one of our um our
[04:39] our um our head of Business Development
[04:44] is actually based in Thailand and
[04:46] Thailand um the about 18% of the
[04:49] population is unbanked and there's still
[04:52] a big Reliance on cash there and as you
[04:55] know very well why we're into Bitcoin is
[04:57] we understand the traditional banking
[04:59] system is like slow and costly and
[05:00] restrictive there so there's it's it's a
[05:04] perfect place to uh to test out these uh
[05:06] these um this this strategy so yeah it's
[05:09] exciting um Thailand's Got a huge
[05:12] population and it's it's it has it's
[05:15] connected to a lot of the world it's
[05:16] it's it's a great tourist destination so
[05:20] anything that happens at Thailand has
[05:22] has can have an effect for um other
[05:24] other um tourist hotspots and um and
[05:27] it's it it it can be quite promising
[05:29] really
[05:30] and this is a program coming from the
[05:33] government or is that something
[05:34] Grassroots that comes up in
[05:37] the it's it's both because we're
[05:39] actually um there are efforts to work
[05:40] with the with uh with the government
[05:42] there to to to create regulation there
[05:44] is um there's there's use already quite
[05:47] a lot of people in time actually use um
[05:49] stable coins there and there is quite a
[05:52] bit of bit um crypto use there but we're
[05:55] trying to point people in the direction
[05:56] of Bitcoin so yeah we're working with um
[05:59] the individual ual uh private and also
[06:01] State as well so it's it's it's a it's a
[06:04] collaboration really I'm still very
[06:06] early stages but it's it's looking
[06:08] promising cool so that could be an
[06:11] similar trigger that we had in in El
[06:13] Salvador where then all of the sudden
[06:15] the government and and higher officials
[06:17] come into the game and and maybe pick up
[06:19] on the project well that's part of the
[06:21] idea because what happened in Salvador
[06:22] can it shows that it's a proven case
[06:25] study and we're seeing the success it's
[06:28] having in Salvador even though we've had
[06:30] recent developments with IMF and the
[06:31] involvement of IMF in Salvador again but
[06:33] uh I don't think that should be you
[06:35] should take that uh we should take that
[06:37] with a pinch a grain of salt that really
[06:39] that's just part of the adoption process
[06:41] you know you don't go from zero to
[06:42] Bitcoin in a second and we are still
[06:44] living in a Fiat world and you're not
[06:47] going to go even us as individuals going
[06:50] straight from a Fiat standard onto a
[06:51] Bitcoin standard as individuals I don't
[06:54] personally work completely the Bitcoin
[06:56] standard world I I have to transact with
[06:58] Fiat so we live in a very globalized
[07:00] World we're still connected very much to
[07:02] Fiat so these thing this this process is
[07:04] never going to be immediate it's going
[07:06] to take time it's going to be Peaks and
[07:08] Trust so looking at looking at El
[07:10] Salvador is a still a great case study
[07:12] of what the success of of of President
[07:15] B's Administration has done there so
[07:18] yeah I think that can be replicated in
[07:20] many parts and it has to stop with
[07:22] actual small projects I mean obviously
[07:25] top down is what we're looking at that's
[07:28] what J 3 is focused on as well but
[07:29] bottom up is how Bitcoin works so small
[07:32] projects like that lead to big things
[07:34] big
[07:35] changes yeah and I'll just bring that
[07:37] example of of my podcast of uh I talk
[07:40] only about Bitcoin I have only Bitcoin
[07:43] only sponsors I bitcoiners are working
[07:46] uh with me on the podcast for the Post
[07:48] production and still I have to transact
[07:51] with fat so I have fat income also I
[07:54] have to transact sometimes with
[07:55] suppliers with with Fiat so I I would be
[07:58] kind of an easy prime example of being
[08:01] Bitcoin only but it would the podcast
[08:04] wouldn't just be part even the Riverside
[08:06] app right now I cannot pay them directly
[08:09] uh in in Bitcoin so there's a lot of uh
[08:13] um barriers still in the field Network
[08:15] system and the field network is so big
[08:18] that it it's kind of hard even for
[08:20] someone so ingrained in Bitcoin to be
[08:22] Bitcoin only that's like it's it's just
[08:24] impossible at that point yes I mean it's
[08:27] quite idealistic to think that we can go
[08:29] straight jump into straight into a
[08:30] Bitcoin standard maybe it's easier for
[08:32] some people in some parts of the world
[08:34] if you live in a in in a jurisdiction
[08:36] that allows what that is more Bitcoin
[08:38] friendly but for example for myself
[08:40] where I live in Serbia there's not many
[08:42] bit uh vendors that that actually use
[08:45] Bitcoin um there is a lot of people that
[08:47] own Bitcoin here but uh regulations and
[08:50] well regulations I want to say they're
[08:52] they're they're they're they're um are
[08:54] negative towards Bitcoin they recognize
[08:56] Bitcoin but uh we we still have capital
[08:59] gains tax tax here and in general it's
[09:01] uh it's it's not widely adopted like in
[09:04] other parts in of in Europe like for
[09:06] example Switzerland or Czech Republic so
[09:09] yeah it's it's tough if you I would love
[09:12] to be working in a Bitcoin standard
[09:14] world but it's it's we're still very far
[09:15] away from that but uh we're working
[09:16] towards that yeah absolutely um because
[09:20] you mentioned it how do you look at the
[09:22] uh El Salvador IMF deal a lot of people
[09:25] are very frustrated with with that um I
[09:29] don't like I was personally in Salvador
[09:32] and also for me there were no vendor
[09:36] forced to adopt adopt Bitcoin I tried to
[09:39] pay with Bitcoin so it was not that much
[09:41] possible anyway so I don't know what's
[09:44] the the big deal with that yeah I mean
[09:47] start with as I as I touched on before
[09:49] it's um it's difficult to go from from
[09:52] Fiat straight to bit to a Bitcoin
[09:54] standard even though they given the
[09:55] option to people to use US dollar and to
[09:58] use Bitcoin um it's going to be
[10:01] difficult to get everyone on board at um
[10:03] working on bitcoin it's it's going to
[10:06] take time and I think our Salvador did
[10:09] did some great moves some great steps
[10:10] there um but I think part of the issue
[10:13] with Salvador was uh rushing it as well
[10:16] with cha wallet and actually maybe this
[10:19] IMF thing is actually comes with a
[10:21] silver lining that um it's a way of
[10:22] actually phasing out Cho and actually
[10:25] using more private um wallets to to to
[10:28] power the adoption
[10:30] um the centralization achiever maybe
[10:32] wasn't working out I won't go into the
[10:35] details I'm not very technical to go
[10:36] into that but I you know you got to look
[10:38] at the positives over here and I think
[10:41] IMF the IMF maybe want um elav though
[10:44] maybe just played the IMF to some expect
[10:47] to some respect that it's a way of
[10:49] getting a cheaper loan that they
[10:51] couldn't have gotten if they hadn't they
[10:52] adopted Bitcoin so they El star would
[10:55] used the IMF to get a cheap loan to to
[10:57] further develop their country so the IMF
[11:00] maybe needs elav more than elav needs
[11:02] the IMF you got to look at it that way
[11:03] as well and I mean the changes to the
[11:06] Bitcoin law aren't that grave at all you
[11:09] can still it's still accepted it might
[11:11] not be legal tender as it was before but
[11:13] it's still accepted you can still use it
[11:15] there's no capital gains tax on it there
[11:17] it's completely free to use and I think
[11:20] that's good enough for now so I'm I'm
[11:22] still very bullish about El Salvador and
[11:25] yeah it's
[11:26] it's I think it was yeah we're going to
[11:29] have to have some teething problems when
[11:32] uh when when you adop when you go when
[11:33] you jump into uh into into into a new
[11:37] system so to speak and nothing's going
[11:40] to be nothing's going to go go hit the
[11:41] ground running perfectly so it's going
[11:43] to take time and we're we're figuring
[11:45] things out but uh I think it's good that
[11:49] people are are worried about it because
[11:50] it shows that we care and a lot of
[11:52] people have relocated El Salvador for
[11:56] the reason that they because of Bitcoin
[11:58] adoption so naturally these people are
[12:00] worried that what what does it mean for
[12:02] their their existence in El Salvador if
[12:04] Bitcoin is been challenged but I don't
[12:06] think bitcoin's been challenge at all I
[12:07] think it's very clear that bu is is is
[12:11] is a is very much into Bitcoin he
[12:13] understands Bitcoin and he sees the
[12:15] future in Bitcoin but obviously there's
[12:18] you know teething yet problems and we
[12:20] just these things will will be ironed
[12:21] out in the future so I'm very I'm very
[12:23] positive about El Salvador and there's
[12:26] no changes all uh changes also to them
[12:29] buying Bitcoin I heard something that
[12:32] there might be but uh I I still see na
[12:37] stacking on Twitter I still see them
[12:38] stacking there was some talk about them
[12:40] not stacking not being able to stack
[12:42] anymore that was part of the IMF deal um
[12:44] but I'm not too sure I need to I'm not
[12:46] that clued up on that part but I think
[12:50] they were still stacking very until very
[12:51] recently so you can it can be tracked it
[12:55] can be tracked online anyway
[12:57] so maybe view maybe the viewers can uh
[13:00] can update us on that one yeah yeah it's
[13:03] always great because they they put the
[13:05] the the public address there you can
[13:07] actually see
[13:10] yeaha about Bitcoin is the transparency
[13:13] of it sometimes but sometimes they can
[13:14] go even when before the IMF uh the the
[13:17] new IMF loan there was sometimes maybe
[13:20] 10 10 days two weeks of where they
[13:22] wouldn't stack and then after after that
[13:24] all a sudden you could see them stack 20
[13:25] 30 40 50 coins in a day or something
[13:27] like that so I don't know I haven't
[13:30] checked in it recently but maybe maybe
[13:32] it's time that I that we do check on
[13:33] that it would be also weird if the IMF
[13:37] now says to El Salvador you cannot stack
[13:41] while the USA just said they're now
[13:44] stacking Bitcoin right that that's true
[13:48] that would be weird timing well here's
[13:51] the thing so maybe there might be
[13:52] something in in the in the new law that
[13:55] prohibits them from stacking directly
[13:56] but there's other ways of stacking
[13:58] Bitcoin from uh you don't have to buy it
[14:01] directly from uh the government doesn't
[14:03] have to stack directly there's other
[14:04] neutral strategies that you can use you
[14:07] can use your energy your energy capacity
[14:09] you can use fees on on on wallet you can
[14:11] use a lot of stuff to stack Bitcoin yeah
[14:14] like Budan did since I think like9 or
[14:17] something like that well yes um well
[14:20] bhan apparently has more Bitcoin in El
[14:22] Salvador yeah I also heard and it's it's
[14:25] uh crazy because if I got the buan story
[14:28] correct they are using Bitcoin mining
[14:31] since 2019 to stack Bitcoin and they
[14:34] only announced that in
[14:36] 2024 if if I'm correct um and if that's
[14:41] true my question is like how many more
[14:43] countries already do that that we just
[14:45] don't know about right I mean one thing
[14:47] is that's it's for sure that other
[14:49] countries that we that that we don't
[14:51] know about are stacking Bitcoin or are
[14:53] getting involved in Bitcoin in projects
[14:55] because we're hearing every now and then
[14:57] new stories like the one that happened
[15:00] in Bhutan also if you remember two years
[15:03] ago in Oman around summer
[15:06] 20123 a man announced that they' uh
[15:10] they' invested about a billion dollars
[15:11] into into mining infrastructure given
[15:13] their energy capacity there so this this
[15:16] shows you that the nation states are
[15:18] actively getting involved in in in in
[15:20] mining you can just see by the hash rate
[15:24] that hash rate is always booming always
[15:27] skyrocketing and you got to wonder
[15:28] whether hash rate comes from it doesn't
[15:30] just come from for the private se you
[15:32] got you have to wonder that a lot of
[15:34] that is probably coming from nation
[15:35] state adoption that will probably not
[15:36] fully aware of um when people talk about
[15:40] nation state adoption a lot of them
[15:42] people think about um store value and
[15:45] maybe medium exchange but really I think
[15:47] the biggest adoption is is happening um
[15:49] in mining interesting it it makes you
[15:53] wonder if you look at all the things
[15:55] that are currently doing uh currently
[15:57] going on uh with small smaller countries
[16:00] like Budan is a very small country it's
[16:02] like half the size of Vienna uh then
[16:04] like El Salvador is kind of the size of
[16:07] Austria but also still small but then
[16:08] there's America uh that is now doing
[16:11] doing things and there are talks with
[16:13] other nations um it's it's kind of it
[16:16] feels like it's actually happening and
[16:18] if you just soon back like five years it
[16:21] would be so crazy to even talk about
[16:23] nation state adoption with a small
[16:26] nation and now we are having America uh
[16:29] in the game what do you think is is
[16:32] missing for for people to go like oh
[16:34] like this is Hab a bit conization is
[16:36] actually happening and like the price is
[16:38] ripping and the adoption is growing I
[16:41] think one thing that's people maybe the
[16:43] people talking about it but I'm not
[16:44] really seeing this is the association
[16:47] with Bitcoin and Trump I think that's
[16:50] holding back a lot of people given that
[16:52] Trump is not very popular with a lot of
[16:54] the uh lot of the a lot of people around
[16:57] the world and I have to admit that you
[17:00] know 10 years ago when Trump first came
[17:03] about in into politics I wasn't very
[17:05] keen about Trump but obviously My Views
[17:07] change given what he's doing and what
[17:09] he's uh what he's given that I woke up
[17:12] to a lot of things over the last five
[17:14] six years that I'm not I'm seeing Trump
[17:16] in a different light and I think many
[17:18] people are still stuck in the in what
[17:20] Trump uh in what the what the mainstream
[17:22] talk about Trump you know the story so
[17:25] the association with Trump and Bitcoin
[17:26] is maybe what's damaging um
[17:30] well I say people accepting Bitcoin in
[17:33] in a in a positive light and obviously
[17:36] that's very flawed because Bitcoin
[17:37] doesn't really care about politicians so
[17:41] it's just the fact that there's one
[17:42] politician that's actually caring about
[17:44] Bitcoin and seeing its potential and
[17:46] sadly that that one politician is
[17:48] not well well received around the world
[17:51] is is going to Imp imped in some
[17:53] adoption but I don't see as much of a uh
[17:56] much of a of a of of of an obstacle but
[18:00] I have to note I have to note that you
[18:01] know within
[18:02] some friendship circles that I have
[18:05] still in the in the West in in western
[18:07] parts of the world since I I moved to
[18:09] Serbia four five years ago I I have a
[18:12] lot of friends in in the UK and Spain
[18:14] and stuff and given the sentiment is
[18:16] very anti-trump there um the sentiment
[18:19] is still very anti- Bitcoin and I think
[18:22] that plays a does play a small factor
[18:24] but some of them even they are
[18:25] anti-trump will will are holding Bitcoin
[18:28] or other crypto to some extent so I
[18:31] think that's just going to be a
[18:33] short-term thing um and maybe that's
[18:36] probably one of the reasons why we're
[18:37] not seeing such
[18:39] big movements in in the retail Market
[18:42] people talking about it the mainstream
[18:43] media talking about it because they're
[18:45] probably actively trying to suppress it
[18:47] is to talk about Bitcoin on the on the
[18:50] on the on the on the mainstream stage
[18:52] for obvious reasons so yeah it's just
[18:55] maybe some I'm just sort of thinking out
[18:57] loud over here maybe that's one of the
[18:59] reasons why we have we're not seeing the
[19:01] the rush in in retail at the moment like
[19:03] we would see in 2021 or even
[19:06] 2017 but I think it's it's about to
[19:08] happen I mean just look at the Google
[19:10] searches for Bitcoin it's not what're
[19:12] they're still way below what they were
[19:14] in 2021 or even before Trump took office
[19:17] so I think there there will be a point
[19:20] where people will pick up on it and I
[19:22] think price is always the one that makes
[19:25] people move when when they see Bitcoin
[19:27] move and it goes over 100,000 maybe
[19:29] people start picking up on it but then
[19:31] at the same time people probably also
[19:33] think that yeah
[19:34] $100,000 Bitcoin is very expensive so
[19:37] they yeah it's it's I think it's a few
[19:39] things working
[19:41] there absolutely I I just want to bring
[19:43] it up because I think it's it's always
[19:45] great I mean there's always that also
[19:47] that factor that less and less people
[19:50] Google nowadays with AI but I think it's
[19:53] still a very valid thing thing to show
[19:56] here um the the Google Trends
[19:59] uh and it's it's super interesting when
[20:00] you look at uh at the at at those levels
[20:03] we had in
[20:04] 2021 not even when we reached the 100K
[20:08] around that time we didn't even come
[20:11] close we came like
[20:13] 64% there and the price uh was like I
[20:16] don't know 40 30% higher or like
[20:19] something like that uh so so there was a
[20:22] a massive price difference uh but the
[20:25] Google Trends and the retail Market
[20:27] didn't had the same high and I
[20:30] also it was an interesting time also for
[20:32] me because like Christmas is usually a
[20:34] time where people come back to the
[20:35] families and go on round tables where
[20:38] more people are involved that you
[20:40] probably haven't seen the whole all of
[20:42] the year uh and nobody cared about
[20:45] Bitcoin at all and I was like it's like
[20:48] it's it's a it's a side topic that
[20:51] people say oh no it uses too much energy
[20:53] yeah that's it the people still still
[20:55] stuck with a lot of the old fud I think
[20:57] another thing that was detracted away
[20:58] from from um any sort of Bitcoin hype is
[21:02] AI That's coming now big big it came in
[21:06] big 2023 2024 yeah there's more talk I'm
[21:09] hearing more talk about AI than Bitcoin
[21:12] Bitcoin seems to be yesterday's news
[21:15] which in a ways I think it has is
[21:17] positive because it shows that it's uh
[21:19] it's there it's it's it's established
[21:21] maybe does the hype around it is not as
[21:24] as um is is a good thing um and we're
[21:28] sign to see now that because a lot of
[21:29] people have are are got to bitcoin for
[21:32] me for be for for for to try and make
[21:34] money like a Qui getrich quick scheme um
[21:38] that's not really the case anymore given
[21:40] also a lot of the other cryptos uh all
[21:42] the altcoins shitcoins are failing and
[21:44] we're seeing that they are
[21:45] all not not doing too great I mean
[21:48] there's that people aren't
[21:52] uh aren't that interested in that
[21:54] anymore and now that Bitcoin network is
[21:56] growing steadily is is is is always
[22:00] growing is always being adopted that uh
[22:02] yeah it's it shows that it's somewhat
[22:05] less volatile as it was before adoption
[22:08] it's not adoption like the um how how to
[22:11] describe this uh um that it's not as
[22:14] hyped as it was as it used to be and
[22:16] people are people are more um accustomed
[22:19] to bitcoin doing what it's doing right
[22:20] now not saying that it's not going to go
[22:22] through another hype and it's going to
[22:23] go through another another um another
[22:26] Mania uh but I think now we're not going
[22:28] to see that the Peaks that we did in
[22:31] 2017 and maybe even
[22:34] 2021 although I'm very bullish and I
[22:36] we'll see the price of Bitcoin is going
[22:37] to reach over it's going to get close to
[22:41] a million at some point but um it's
[22:42] going to always rise but maybe not to
[22:44] the not to the not like the Peaks and
[22:47] thrusts that we used to get in the past
[22:48] it's super interesting because I think
[22:50] 2017 was the last really huge Mania
[22:55] where like you you couldn't get out of
[22:58] house without talking about Bitcoin
[22:59] almost and this was actually the first
[23:01] year where I also heard about Bitcoin it
[23:03] was just like everyone was talking about
[23:06] it at least in in in in my circles is
[23:08] that is that something where and we you
[23:11] talked about it a little bit now but is
[23:13] it something that we might see again if
[23:16] we have like a suddenly phase or is this
[23:19] just now is is Bitcoin already too
[23:22] established basically that people are
[23:24] like yeah of course Bitcoin goes up like
[23:26] I've seen it from like 5,000 to to
[23:28] 50,000 now it goes from 880,000 to maybe
[23:32] 500,000 and people are like oh it's goes
[23:34] goes up I don't know I don't I don't
[23:35] like it still well I think the other
[23:39] thing is that we have to talk about is
[23:41] price suppression as well I think that's
[23:43] even though we're talk everyone talks
[23:45] about that the that there's a that that
[23:47] that Bitcoin
[23:49] is that there will be a supply shock and
[23:52] I think there is there is a supply shock
[23:54] the amount of Bitcoins traded openly
[23:56] traded compared to how much are been
[23:58] held by by by long-term holders how much
[24:01] is available is it's nothing so really
[24:05] it won't require that much for it to
[24:07] move drastically up but there is because
[24:10] given it's it's a
[24:12] completely open free
[24:15] market that even with regulations around
[24:18] the world trying to impose on it nothing
[24:20] it won't it won't stop doing what it's
[24:22] doing people are able to control the
[24:24] market to some extent so maybe that's
[24:27] what's acting on that's what acted on
[24:29] the 2021 Market that's what suppressed
[24:31] its price from from jumping too high up
[24:33] I think that it could we could get that
[24:35] again in in 2 and 2025 but I think that
[24:38] there will be one point where it will
[24:40] run away it will it has to run away you
[24:43] can't you know nothing's you can't
[24:44] control can't control it forever so you
[24:49] will get maybe Samson M Omega candle and
[24:52] you will get a green green candle that's
[24:55] just going to destroy all everything but
[24:58] uh
[24:58] I'm I'm remaining cautious and I'm going
[25:00] to say that yeah I don't know when
[25:01] that's going to happen I'm going to say
[25:02] and I'm hopefully it will happen some
[25:04] point but I'm very happy that you know
[25:06] the that where the price is today and I
[25:08] think it's just going to continue
[25:09] growing and even if it means that the
[25:12] that that Bitcoin doesn't rise like it
[25:14] did in the past but continues Rising
[25:15] that's how Bitcoin was intended was
[25:17] designed to do that it's it's it's
[25:19] deflationary money and it's always going
[25:21] to rise your your your value is always
[25:23] going to rise over time yeah that's
[25:25] that's a it's a good one it's also I get
[25:28] that that comment I think since uh one
[25:30] two weeks on a very regular basis that
[25:32] people are basically frustrated or
[25:35] saying that the price is suppressed by
[25:37] big players uh they usually mention
[25:39] Black Rock and coinbase but sometimes
[25:41] also uh other companies but black CR and
[25:44] coinbase is still usually those who who
[25:47] come in there obviously because coinbase
[25:50] I I saw statistic they hold like over
[25:51] two million Bitcoin if that's that's
[25:53] correct please don't quote me on that
[25:55] but some some crazy amount that they
[25:57] they hold uh and black rock and and ETF
[26:00] holders of course also and they usually
[26:02] store it at coinbase do you think that
[26:05] that there's actually something
[26:07] happening I mean FDX we know they had
[26:10] had a lot less Bitcoin than they
[26:11] actually I claimed to have and it's it's
[26:14] a real possibility for for those players
[26:16] short term to do that well there if
[26:18] there is H something happening they're
[26:19] hiding it quite well maybe there's some
[26:21] of us out there who are more in tune to
[26:23] what's going on and able to analyze that
[26:25] better but and I don't want to I don't
[26:27] want to be the one to say that there's
[26:29] there's definitely some naughty business
[26:31] but given the incentive structure to
[26:33] do um in to to be to
[26:37] be yeah given in Fiat incentive
[26:40] structure that we still live under um
[26:42] you have to you have to entertain the
[26:44] idea that there is uh some some naughty
[26:48] um activities happening that are
[26:51] suppressing the price and meaning that
[26:52] people some of the big players players
[26:54] can actively get their hands on more
[26:57] Bitcoin at at cheaper prices and one
[27:00] thing I have to note that given at genan
[27:01] 3 we are we do have an OTC and we have
[27:04] um we we are we are buying selling
[27:06] Bitcoin there's a lot of uh private
[27:08] individuals um that are actively
[27:11] stucking a lot of Bitcoin right now and
[27:13] we hear on the wider Market there's a
[27:15] lot of a lot of um people a lot of um
[27:18] institutions and and big and big private
[27:21] individuals that are buying more so than
[27:24] they did in the past so yeah demand is
[27:27] is growing all the time yet the price is
[27:30] is not really moving that much so you
[27:32] have to definitely entertain the idea
[27:34] that there is some some suppression
[27:36] going on but as I said before you can't
[27:39] suppress it forever and there will be a
[27:40] point where it'll run
[27:42] away is there a shift happening from
[27:46] retail driven Market to like
[27:48] institutional driven Market well you see
[27:50] it right now with with uh with with
[27:53] strategy formerly known as micro
[27:55] strategy with all the new products that
[27:57] they're coming out with
[27:59] it's it's incredible what they're doing
[28:00] um I don't want to comment on it because
[28:02] I'm not that in tune to exactly how
[28:04] they're doing it but uh it's shows you
[28:06] that institutional adoption is is is
[28:11] definitely there it's you can see many
[28:13] more institutions around the world
[28:15] adopting Bitcoin and that number is
[28:16] growing all the time um all you have to
[28:18] do is go into Twitter and just see a lot
[28:20] of people are talking about it it's it's
[28:21] F it's it's amazing to see obviously I
[28:24] it's not the right sort of institution
[28:26] we bitcoiners like to see we like to see
[28:28] individuals adopting Bitcoin and but I
[28:32] think that's happening all the time and
[28:34] maybe just people aren't talking about
[28:35] it as much but what keeps what Hypes
[28:38] people up is seeing big players um
[28:41] institutions nation states and stuff
[28:43] wanting to adoped because that seems to
[28:45] be like the bullish
[28:46] news and that's what's going to drive
[28:48] price and at the end of day what you
[28:50] know when you see price movement it's
[28:51] what drives more adoption because at the
[28:52] end of day we all care about uh the
[28:55] number go
[28:56] up yeah but I I always laugh at people
[29:01] uh uh when they complain of of who buys
[29:04] Bitcoin they're like oh I don't like
[29:05] this the big institutions byy Bitcoin is
[29:07] for everyone even if you don't agree
[29:10] with it even if you don't like it yes we
[29:12] want the uh The Single Moms we want the
[29:15] families we want the the people that
[29:17] actually need Bitcoin to buy Bitcoin
[29:19] before the
[29:20] institutions uh but history shows that
[29:24] usually the the the people that research
[29:27] deeply the people that have the smart
[29:29] money I usually quicker on those and
[29:31] Bitcoin is actually kind of um uh
[29:34] magical where retail had such a long
[29:37] time where you can already accumulate
[29:39] with like 10 15 years before
[29:41] institutions really came to bitcoin and
[29:43] it's like yeah if you're still not into
[29:45] Bitcoin your fault right yeah but you
[29:49] can see at the in the in the statistics
[29:51] that a lot of that the vast majority of
[29:53] Bitcoin out there is held by individuals
[29:57] um we don't know exactly how who it is
[29:59] but you can see that institutional the
[30:01] known coins out there that institutions
[30:04] and nation states only account from
[30:07] don't quote me on here but maybe 10 15
[30:09] 20% of of actual Bitcoin uh Supply out
[30:12] there so the vast majority is held in
[30:14] retail hands and you can't say that for
[30:16] Fiat because in Fiat it's the other way
[30:18] around um retail holds very small
[30:20] percent of it whereas the big players we
[30:23] don't know how far how you know they own
[30:26] the vast majority vast quantity of Fe
[30:28] out there which and it's always
[30:30] expanding it's and people say that
[30:32] Bitcoin is unfair it's the other way
[30:34] around
[30:36] um yeah that's yeah it's a good point
[30:40] that always comes up of like oh like
[30:42] Bitcoin it's so unfair that there's like
[30:44] OG's in Bitcoin it's like really did you
[30:47] ever look at the field
[30:48] system exactly uh that was that one EU
[30:53] paper ECB paper I should say that came
[30:55] out around October last year and there
[30:58] was a good rebal to that paper done by
[31:00] um the bit uh was who was it who did
[31:03] that it was uh and the Freddy new for UK
[31:07] Bitcoin policy um and who is that I
[31:11] forget who was uh I don't
[31:13] quote I completely forgot the other but
[31:16] they made a very good rebal of that ECB
[31:18] paper that basically they were still
[31:21] hitting on old old fud as you said like
[31:23] concentration of Bitcoin is a is a is a
[31:25] problem and those and it means that
[31:27] those OG GS who are in Bitcoin are going
[31:29] to be better off than than your new adop
[31:32] adopters new people who are get into
[31:34] Bitcoin and it's it's it they make
[31:37] clever arguments like that but easy de
[31:39] easy debunked at the end of the day um
[31:41] because at the end day it doesn't matter
[31:42] if you own the most amount of Bitcoin
[31:44] the person with the most amount of
[31:45] Bitcoin plays by the same rules the
[31:47] person with the least amount of Bitcoin
[31:48] let's take a break for a moment and
[31:50] appreciate the puted that coin vigilante
[31:54] has made with the Bitcoin watches those
[31:57] watches are the most amazing the most
[31:59] elegent way of showing that you are a
[32:02] true bitcoiner and coin vigilante just
[32:05] dropped the completely new and amazing
[32:08] Genesis edition of their watch
[32:11] collections you have the date of the
[32:13] first ever minded Bitcoin Block in there
[32:16] and of course also the block height and
[32:19] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[32:22] the level of detail they put in in this
[32:25] masterpiece make sure to check out those
[32:27] amazing coin vigilante the time pieces
[32:30] down in the descriptions I love those
[32:32] watches so so much and now if you have
[32:36] Bitcoin I really do hope that you don't
[32:38] have it on Exchange but if you do have
[32:40] it on Exchange I have two ways for you
[32:43] to deal with that the first way is you
[32:45] put it on a hardware wallet that's the
[32:47] entry for you to get into the self
[32:50] custody game I recommend bitbox Bitcoin
[32:53] only Edition for that it's a super
[32:56] simple and secure way and if you check
[32:59] out the link in the description you even
[33:01] get 5% off if you use the code Robin and
[33:04] the second way is the Bitcoin way the
[33:07] Bitcoin way is your Allin partner in
[33:10] terms of how to get the most out of your
[33:14] sovereignty they will personalize for
[33:16] you a self custody setup that is perfect
[33:19] for your individual situation they will
[33:22] show you how you can secure your own
[33:25] devices securing your Bitcoin is not
[33:27] enough you also have to keep all your
[33:29] devices secure one topic that is
[33:31] overlooked often is the inheritance plan
[33:34] what happens with your Bitcoin once you
[33:37] are no longer here do you have a plan
[33:40] for that in place already and last but
[33:42] not least if you're in jurisdictions
[33:44] where you don't feel safe it's better to
[33:47] get a plan B for all that head over to
[33:50] the Bitcoin way.com
[33:52] robobin to get a 30 minute free call and
[33:56] just a quick side not I will be for the
[33:59] first time ever speaking at the Bitcoin
[34:01] Prague event in June it will be
[34:04] absolutely legendary and I'm really
[34:06] looking forward to seeing all of you
[34:08] there you can get your ticket in the
[34:11] link down in the description of Bitcoin
[34:13] BR and very important use code Robin to
[34:16] get 10% off your ticket I'm really
[34:19] looking forward seeing you there and
[34:21] it's it's from the ECP uh the paper I I
[34:25] looked at that and it it was for me it
[34:28] is an kind of an how should I say it
[34:32] it's kind of they acknowledge that
[34:34] Bitcoin isn't going away and now they
[34:37] try to attack the the the holders and
[34:42] taxing them in the future and already
[34:44] preparing that Narrative of like because
[34:46] we know Bitcoin will go up and the
[34:49] hodlers will get a lot of wealth from
[34:51] that let's make sure we say it's unfair
[34:54] already now so we can more easily tax in
[34:57] the future that's kind of the the the
[35:01] narrative or the theory that that I got
[35:03] from that and was this the paper where
[35:06] they also wrote that uh the 10 million
[35:09] price of of of Bitcoin somehow in there
[35:12] uh that that that was that was great
[35:15] crazy for me I've got I've got the names
[35:17] over here it's Murray Rod um Alan
[35:19] farington and Freddy new and Dennis
[35:21] Porter and the bit the the the ecv paper
[35:25] was basically doing the old attacking
[35:27] criticizing BT's volatility um lack of
[35:30] productive contribution wealth
[35:32] concentration and they were trying to
[35:34] advocate for cbdcs which is another
[35:36] thing that we we we can touch on a
[35:38] little bit right now that recent there
[35:40] were some recent developments that that
[35:42] the ECB legard was sing that later this
[35:44] year there will be u a cbdc adopted in
[35:48] in in the European Union uh which I got
[35:51] to say that I don't think it's going to
[35:53] happen because people understand I think
[35:56] even the retail Market a lot of people
[35:58] who don't really understand Bitcoin will
[35:59] see something like
[36:01] cbdcs and and will associate it to to
[36:04] something Chinese something like social
[36:06] credit scoring and should automatically
[36:08] be repelled by
[36:10] it I'm not getting my hopes up too much
[36:13] about it but um I think that we as
[36:16] humans are very well aware of that
[36:18] attempt on absolute control so I'm not
[36:21] too scared by it as I was before in the
[36:24] past and I think maybe the general
[36:26] public are more aware are more a little
[36:28] bit more educated about what cryptos are
[36:30] obviously they're not fully educated and
[36:32] otherwise everyone will be understanding
[36:33] what Bitcoin what it is and what what
[36:35] entails but I think now that cbdcs
[36:38] bitcoiners and people who are very anti
[36:41] cbdcs have done such a good
[36:43] job vocalizing what the dangers are of
[36:47] cbdcs I think it's now that's that
[36:49] information has hit the general retail
[36:51] Market better than it was you know than
[36:54] it was maybe three four years ago
[36:57] yeah and we if you just see um how many
[37:01] more Bitcoin only content creators there
[37:04] are now how many more Bitcoin only
[37:06] companies there are the whole Market
[37:08] really transformed in the last three
[37:10] four years and yeah Mar R is is is a is
[37:12] a is a great guy he even uh he sent me
[37:16] this actually in in the morning um he's
[37:20] um taking podcasts and and making
[37:22] summaries and learnings from that and
[37:24] and one of the podcasts he does it with
[37:26] is actually this podcast
[37:28] and I never saw that and he sent it to
[37:29] me in the morning and he did it since
[37:32] the last like months and he had like 50
[37:35] podcast episode of mine and and
[37:36] distilled them so he's I think he's
[37:38] doing a really good uh uh thing of like
[37:41] diving deeper into topics and and Mar
[37:44] rtis I can highly recommend that I
[37:46] didn't know that I got to look into that
[37:48] that sounds really useful oh yeah wait I
[37:51] can I can maybe quickly show this if if
[37:54] people are interested in that uh he
[37:57] called it the I mean it's mer rat. proo
[38:00] and and he calls it the Bitcoin
[38:01] Distillery uh and for example with my
[38:04] podcast uh he's just diving into the
[38:08] episodes uh and and then you can just
[38:11] click on the episodes for example this
[38:13] was the one where we dived into the idea
[38:16] that John Nash might be satos
[38:19] Nakamoto and and and uh you have you
[38:23] have the summary some key points and and
[38:26] then he uh really try tries to get
[38:29] deeper into the topic uh and uh
[38:32] especially if you have don't have like
[38:34] uh I I also thought along about if I
[38:37] should do that because some people say
[38:38] like oh I don't have time one two hours
[38:41] to watch every day an episode but it
[38:43] would be great to have like a 10 minute
[38:46] or five minute update from that to see
[38:48] if there's something interesting in
[38:49] there and then you can dive deeper and
[38:50] well this is something very useful to to
[38:52] a lot of us who are very busy who have
[38:54] families who don't have much time and
[38:55] there's so much information so many
[38:57] podcast out there so many good podcasts
[38:59] like yourself that's that's a really
[39:01] good tool absolutely I'm going to use
[39:03] that thank you very much thank you thank
[39:05] you Robin thank you Mari for for for for
[39:08] that that's that's really useful yeah he
[39:11] he does a great job I just looked at it
[39:12] today and I was like oh that's really
[39:14] I'm actually fascinated how people take
[39:17] the podcast and do things with it there
[39:19] are some some people even on Twitter
[39:21] that doas and just like uh uh tag the
[39:24] the first one and then go with Fred by
[39:27] fr and and just document it so you you
[39:30] can find uh those resources I think Edge
[39:33] 21 is also doing that there are a bunch
[39:35] of other ones that I cannot recall by
[39:37] heart now but uh it's actually really
[39:40] really cool uh because they provide a
[39:42] service that's needed they also TR
[39:45] traffic to to my podcast so it's a it's
[39:47] basically a win-win situation for
[39:49] everyone involved
[39:51] fantastic and now we're going to listen
[39:53] to that episode about uh Nash
[39:56] potentially being
[39:58] I mean that's at the end of the day
[40:00] that's what that that's what that's what
[40:01] that's what uh nation state adoption
[40:03] could could could entail is the game
[40:05] theory and that's that's big that's yeah
[40:08] that's what we I mean that's what many
[40:10] bitcoiners talk about is the potential
[40:11] game theory of what of some of of a G7
[40:14] country a massive country like the US
[40:16] the big the biggest um super the
[40:19] superpower of the world adopting Bitcoin
[40:22] and you should set off a game
[40:24] theory across the world but we're not
[40:26] quite seeing that yet I'm using and I'm
[40:29] using what what the US is doing to speak
[40:32] to some contacts of mine my in my region
[40:36] So within Serbia within uh within the
[40:39] former Yugoslavia countries and to try
[40:42] and get them on board to try and get
[40:45] them talking and getting talking about
[40:47] any sort of Bitcoin strategy that could
[40:49] work for them and it is Raising some
[40:54] eyebrows in in good ways which is great
[40:56] but still still very slow
[40:59] and there will be a point where people
[41:01] will pick up on it and it was going to
[41:03] really be an
[41:05] acceleration
[41:07] um I think it's just the messaging as
[41:09] well that we we Bitcoin is are very good
[41:13] at uh at coming up with good messaging
[41:16] but it's difficult to try and convince
[41:19] people who are very much stuck in feat
[41:21] ways that you tell you you you have
[41:25] great ways of explain how Bitcoin work
[41:27] works but still it just does not enter
[41:29] yet so we're still working on techniques
[41:32] of how to improve our messaging and how
[41:33] to how to get how to make make it
[41:36] obvious to people that you really got to
[41:38] adopt Bitcoin but it's it's it's it's
[41:40] we'll get there we'll get there it's
[41:43] interesting game for you for me um and I
[41:45] actually wanted how you look at that um
[41:48] we have now America going uh a clear no
[41:52] to cbdc and
[41:55] clear kind of clear yes to the Bitcoin
[41:57] way uh and then we have EU where it's
[42:01] kind of the opposite so they are not
[42:03] having a clear no to bitcoin uh but
[42:05] they're going with more and more the
[42:07] cbdc rod because anything that Trump
[42:09] does they'll do the opposite so it's
[42:11] like with the war as well with the russ
[42:13] with the Russia Ukraine conflict that's
[42:16] you know uh Trump gets voted in on the
[42:19] premise that he's going to create Global
[42:22] Peace which is fantastic I think because
[42:24] if Trump has to with Trump's America
[42:27] first plan his it can only work if there
[42:30] is peace around the world and so he has
[42:33] to promote peace and that requires
[42:36] getting onto the negotiation table with
[42:38] uh with with Russia but that's obviously
[42:40] pissed off a lot of the So-Cal hardcore
[42:43] Europeans who are very much into the
[42:45] whole Ukraine conflict and trying to
[42:48] push whatever nonsensical IDE ideology
[42:51] that they're trying to push which I
[42:52] don't quite get why you want to expand
[42:54] NATO to to try and to to to to to put uh
[42:57] to to test Russia and it's look it's
[43:00] it's completely it's beyond me Hawai
[43:03] people want more war and it's beyond me
[43:05] why PE why why they think that Ukraine
[43:07] can actually take on Russia and I think
[43:10] Russia is in
[43:12] no Russia doesn't want to have conflict
[43:15] Russia wants to just get on with
[43:16] business and Russia has its interest EUR
[43:20] the EUR Europe should be interested in
[43:22] making business with Russia and Russia
[43:23] is interested in making business with
[43:25] Europe it's simple as that so whoever is
[43:27] pushing for this war it's obviously
[43:29] they're making money in a different way
[43:31] and now that we're they're trying to
[43:32] stop this the US is trying to stop this
[43:36] that Europe realizing that they're that
[43:38] this is going against some of the
[43:39] interests of the force so they're
[43:41] pushing something
[43:43] different and I think anything that
[43:45] America says right now that comes out of
[43:46] the Trump Administration that you're
[43:48] going to see an opposite reaction so
[43:50] that's why you
[43:51] know anti- cbdc America Pro cbdc Europe
[43:54] anti uh Pro Bitcoin America anti- bit on
[43:57] Europe it's just going to have hopefully
[43:59] that will iron out in the future but
[44:01] yeah it's it's kind of worrying to see
[44:03] but I think over time people will start
[44:05] to be a bit more educated about it it's
[44:07] it's
[44:08] also it it really Bo bothers me how some
[44:11] politicians say like oh like it's it's
[44:13] bad that Russia is now talking with with
[44:16] with America like why like just because
[44:20] and they always used the argument of
[44:21] like oh Ukraine is not at the table I'm
[44:23] like of course they are at the table of
[44:25] course they but but in every convers it
[44:28] it bothers me how many people want to
[44:32] end the war in their way or not at all
[44:36] like it has to have that formal way of
[44:39] like okay it has to be with European
[44:41] Union the Ukraine if we can end the war
[44:44] in one way that that's fine I think like
[44:47] it's weird you made a good point that
[44:49] people people are very idealistic about
[44:51] and they want to end in their their way
[44:53] you know the sort of Lefty way which is
[44:55] not going to which is not could it
[44:57] please look we yeah as you said we want
[44:59] to end the war it's and it's do what it
[45:01] takes to end the war not everyone's
[45:03] going to be happy with a solution Russia
[45:05] not going to be happy Ukraine not going
[45:07] to be happy Europe not going to be happy
[45:08] America not going to be happy but one
[45:09] thing we will have to agree on is peace
[45:11] and that's going to come in in ways that
[45:13] not everyone's going to agree on and
[45:15] yeah
[45:16] it's and that what you said before um
[45:19] that
[45:20] Ukraine are not on the table well
[45:22] Ukraine are on the negoti negotiation
[45:26] table they were invited zinski was
[45:27] invited to speak at the White House and
[45:31] obviously that didn't go too well that
[45:34] was an interesting conversation and I
[45:36] think zinsky was badly advised he
[45:38] probably met with some neocon
[45:40] Republicans before that saying yeah you
[45:42] got to go hard at Trump and the first 30
[45:44] minutes of the conversation was good was
[45:46] respectable Trump was going to was going
[45:48] to go see through see through the deal
[45:50] and going to give a to Ukraine but then
[45:52] all of a sudden someone signal within
[45:54] the crowd within within with within uh
[45:57] um ziny staford to to go out basically
[46:01] push Trump on something and that didn't
[46:03] work out and JD van called them out and
[46:05] then you saw how the convers
[46:07] conversation ended up and then the rest
[46:09] and then they use that the the
[46:11] established World Legacy Media used that
[46:13] against Trump against JD Vance and said
[46:15] that the America
[46:17] are are going back this the incorrect
[46:20] way but yeah it's it's the whole thing
[46:23] is is very sad to see but I'm glad that
[46:26] Trump Trump and uh and Putin recently
[46:28] had a very long phone call and they're
[46:31] on the same page where we want peace in
[46:35] not just Ukraine but in the Middle East
[46:37] and it's going to take time you know the
[46:38] trust has been lost over the last five
[46:40] years five four or five years with uh
[46:42] the Ukraine Russia relationship and it's
[46:45] going to take you know it's going to
[46:47] probably take about a decade to regain
[46:48] that trust again but you have to make
[46:50] some some some uncomfortable steps to
[46:52] start with and I think Trump is doing
[46:55] doing the right taking those right steps
[46:57] but it's sad that you see a lot of euu
[47:00] being very warmonger very very very
[47:02] neocon likee and it's and it's it's
[47:05] terrible
[47:06] given how much destruction how many
[47:09] lives have been lost in Ukraine you know
[47:11] some reports are saying that almost A
[47:12] Million Lives have been lost a million
[47:14] soldiers young men have lost in lives
[47:18] have been lost in Ukraine as well as
[47:20] Russian soldiers you're saying up to
[47:22] about 100,000 150,000 Russians have lost
[47:24] as well so this is this is a really ugly
[47:26] situation
[47:27] but anyway this is not we're not talking
[47:29] about geopolitics but having said that
[47:30] you geopolitics is is Bitcoin does get
[47:33] involved in geopolitics and we we got
[47:35] into this conversation thanks to Game
[47:37] Theory thanks to uh Mari ruds and yours
[47:41] podcast about uh about Nash being
[47:43] potentially Satoshi Nakamoto which is
[47:46] interesting I look forward to reading
[47:47] that or at least reading the summary in
[47:49] um in Rod's
[47:51] uh um tool that he
[47:54] created yeah it's it's super interesting
[47:56] where conversations go it's also I I I
[48:00] still do that and I still have like an
[48:02] an outline of like where the
[48:03] conversation could go but usually after
[48:06] 10 20 minutes I completely dismiss it
[48:09] and and the conversation goes somewhere
[48:11] else uh but it it is something very
[48:14] interesting uh when we look at Game
[48:16] Theory um maybe a different approach to
[48:19] that uh people talk about
[48:20] hyperbitcoinization and I think I also
[48:22] heard you talk about that before um how
[48:26] close
[48:27] Are We Now do that if you see at the EU
[48:30] we are kind of a little bit further away
[48:33] China also a little bit but then there's
[48:35] America there's El Salvador there's bu
[48:37] there a lot of other positive examples
[48:39] of that how how long would you say is is
[48:42] that the process is
[48:45] taking I think I think we' seen a lot of
[48:48] a lot of companies now as you said you
[48:51] talked about before a lot of Bitcoin
[48:52] only companies um springing up doing
[48:56] great work in furthering the network
[48:59] expanding the Bitcoin Network and this
[49:01] is what's drives adoption is you know
[49:04] you get Bitcoin the token the price
[49:06] which is what people get on board like I
[49:08] got on board on bitcoin I was I was
[49:10] attracted to the number go up but then I
[49:12] stayed because I saw I saw the uh the
[49:16] future of of of of a
[49:18] decentralized scarce money that is
[49:20] Bitcoin but you start to learn about how
[49:23] Bitcoin is the network as well and
[49:25] that's growing all the time and and
[49:27] there's a lot of great companies out
[49:29] there start doing a lot of work and like
[49:30] at Jan 3 we um yes we F we are focusing
[49:33] on nation state adoption and trying to
[49:35] start top down conversations but uh we
[49:38] we that Bitcoin we understand is a
[49:40] bottomup strategy and that's why we uh
[49:43] Samsung M created Aqua wallet which is
[49:46] one way to accelerate
[49:48] hyperbolization and we want to bank the
[49:51] billions of people that are unbanked
[49:53] across the world the one way to do that
[49:55] is by using the tech technology that we
[49:57] have at hand which is smartphones
[50:00] Bitcoin and USD as well and we're
[50:05] seeing that the use of usdt and I know
[50:07] this is not something a lot of
[50:09] bitcoiners are very keen about because
[50:11] USD works on a lot of shitcoin rails but
[50:14] usct also works on bitcoin on
[50:16] liquid and there's about 400 million or
[50:19] so users of usct around the world and
[50:21] sadly they have to use it mainly on on
[50:23] shitcoin Rails but we
[50:27] understand that they can that can be
[50:29] used as a trojan horse to get people
[50:31] onto Bitcoin that if you get them if you
[50:35] offer a wallet that's not a shitcoin
[50:38] wallet that's not subject to a lot of
[50:40] these pump and dump scams out there and
[50:43] just make it Bitcoin only with usdt on
[50:45] bitcoin
[50:46] liquid and they see a good sturdy wallet
[50:49] like that they will come on come and use
[50:50] it and then they will see Bitcoin on
[50:52] there as well and they will start to use
[50:54] that as a savings account but also as
[50:56] transaction action account as well and
[50:57] that's going to be a Tran horse to more
[50:59] Bitcoin adoption it's just by using it
[51:02] by using an easy wallet like aqua and
[51:05] using USD on it it's it's going to it's
[51:07] going to help adoption so so Aqua Aqua
[51:10] is a a Bitcoin lightning liid uh UCD
[51:16] wallet so Aqua has uh it's so how Aqua
[51:21] works really is um it gives you it's
[51:25] designed to give you like the full power
[51:26] of Bitcoin uh both on chain and on
[51:30] Advanced layer 2 networks like liquid
[51:32] and lightning so you have your layer one
[51:35] on chain which is just normal Bitcoin on
[51:37] chain and then you have your Layer Two
[51:40] which is Bitcoin on liquid and that's
[51:43] your spending account
[51:45] so that is where you can also transact
[51:48] on the liquid network but also it opens
[51:50] up automatically opens up lightning
[51:52] channels and then that's also how you
[51:55] spend USD
[51:57] so when you look at Aqua when you have
[51:58] the the wallet in your in front of you
[52:00] you have your savings account which is
[52:02] Bitcoin layer one and then you have
[52:03] another section which is just spending
[52:04] account which is which is Bitcoin on
[52:06] liquid and usdt and you're able to to
[52:10] move out from one to another easily and
[52:14] using Atomic swaps and it's it it's it's
[52:16] a very seamless operation and it works
[52:18] it works um and it works uh so easy that
[52:22] like as we said your grandmother can use
[52:25] it um the fees are uh when you're using
[52:28] on uh for basically in short like
[52:29] Bitcoin layer one is like for your
[52:31] long-term storage high security you
[52:33] leave your Bitcoin there but then you
[52:34] want to transact quicker you then
[52:37] transfer into Layer Two so you work on
[52:40] on on bitcoin uh liquid and that also
[52:43] means that you can U make transac in
[52:46] lightning as well and that's also you
[52:49] can also TR uh transfer into USD or
[52:52] transfer USD onto onto onto liquid or
[52:54] onto Bitcoin layer one and we do this
[52:57] all very very all all one one one face
[53:00] and it's and it's done very
[53:03] easily really interesting uh there's so
[53:07] many developments coming in in in the
[53:09] Bitcoin ecosystem um it's it's almost
[53:12] hard to to keep up with all the the
[53:14] tools that are out there it's really
[53:16] cool to see I love that um one thing uh
[53:20] because you're from Serbia and we didn't
[53:22] touch on that you I think maybe you
[53:24] touched on a little bit before but how
[53:27] is uh Bitcoin going in Serbia like what
[53:30] what is the the progress there there is
[53:34] lot of people more people coming on
[53:35] board here a lot of people talking about
[53:37] it here especially that given that Seria
[53:39] is very Trump
[53:41] friendly uh there
[53:43] was there was during the ele during the
[53:46] US election there was a um a graph a
[53:49] graph showing all the European countries
[53:51] how many people would vote for for Biden
[53:53] I mean sorry for Harris and how many
[53:55] people will vote for Trump
[53:57] and Serbia had the most Trump voters out
[53:59] of all European
[54:00] countries so yeah I think that helps the
[54:03] fact that Trump has made some moves in
[54:05] Bitcoin um because
[54:08] it's it will help for our case over here
[54:11] so there's there's more more people
[54:13] talking about Bitcoin here and I and I
[54:16] see a lot of a lot of progress happening
[54:19] um right now soia is going through
[54:22] some I an unstable period there was uh
[54:25] there there this massive student L
[54:28] protest that are calling for that are
[54:31] very anti-corruption there was an there
[54:33] was a there was a disaster that happened
[54:35] last November where um in novisad where
[54:39] train
[54:40] canipe uh train station canipe like uh
[54:43] outside the train station collapsed and
[54:46] killed 15 people and people are
[54:49] associated that with the corruption that
[54:51] the country is going through so since
[54:53] that there's been students have
[54:56] created this
[54:58] massive huge protest against
[55:00] anti-corruption anti-government protest
[55:03] and just recently last uh last weekend
[55:06] there was the biggest ever protest the
[55:08] country has ever seen where official
[55:10] numbers are saying 107 107,000 people
[55:14] but actual numbers are probably closer
[55:16] to maybe 500 closer to maybe 7 800,000
[55:19] people on the streets of Seria so that's
[55:21] creating a bit of a tension over here so
[55:23] when it comes to any nation state
[55:25] adoption stuff over here uh there's
[55:28] things are not going to be moving very
[55:29] quickly but when it comes to individual
[55:31] adoption I see more and more of it and
[55:34] people are talking about it a lot more
[55:35] and I'm trying to push
[55:37] for uh private adoption but also trying
[55:40] to make uh trying to make a movement
[55:42] towards uh
[55:44] geothermal energy adoption um using
[55:48] Bitcoin mining as a way to Kickstart
[55:49] geothermal projects there was maybe 15
[55:53] 20 20 20 years ago there was some
[55:55] initial efforts made to make Serbia more
[55:58] Geo uh to improve Serbia's geothermal
[56:01] capacity but given that the high costs
[56:04] of actually drilling these um geothermal
[56:06] Wells to start with have high cost that
[56:09] these these projects didn't last um but
[56:13] now if you attach Bitcoin mining to it
[56:17] uh bootstrap you can actually bootstrap
[56:18] these projects and get them happening
[56:20] much quicker because you're able to make
[56:22] money out of it essentially and that
[56:25] money B Bitcoin can then be used to
[56:27] expand the infrastructure afterwards so
[56:30] it works well it's one of the beautiful
[56:32] things about Bitcoin mining is it can
[56:34] actually further renewable energy clean
[56:36] energy projects like that and that's one
[56:38] thing I'm looking into not just in
[56:40] Serbia but also in Bosnia herzo in the
[56:42] in the Serbian autonomous part that
[56:44] Republic Suba there's a lot of
[56:46] geothermal
[56:47] um potential in this region um maybe not
[56:51] to the levels that you see in like
[56:52] Iceland or in El Salvador and places
[56:54] like that but you do get a lot of of uh
[56:57] Hot Wells here around 100 Dees maybe not
[57:00] as that hot but enough to create
[57:02] electricity and enough to to to to to
[57:04] heat homes as well
[57:06] so it has also other possibilities not
[57:10] just to you can M Bitcoin out of it but
[57:12] also to to reduce to to improve
[57:15] efficiency Energy Efficiency not just
[57:17] through electricity but also through um
[57:19] heating homes it's it it's has so much
[57:22] potential so I'm trying to introduce
[57:24] that in this region here and I'm really
[57:26] bullish about that in the next um 10
[57:28] years that we can get some uh some good
[57:30] projects happening that will improve s
[57:32] um Serbia's and the Region's energy
[57:34] consumption efficiency while at the same
[57:36] time stacking Bitcoin I love that so
[57:39] much it's it's almost like when you see
[57:43] all the things currently going on with
[57:44] Bitcoin and then you see the price of
[57:46] Bitcoin it's like it feels like an
[57:48] Insider
[57:49] trade it feels like we we're seeing more
[57:51] than the general Republic is seeing but
[57:54] it's it's just looking at examples like
[57:55] Bhutan and El Salvador if you use those
[57:57] two as your country to go to country's
[57:59] case studies then you can really see how
[58:01] the the the opportunities are endless
[58:03] really and every country has every
[58:06] country has its own Energy Mix some
[58:08] countries are more energy energy um um
[58:12] have more energy capacity than other
[58:14] countries but every country has some
[58:16] access to energy and energy is money so
[58:19] if you're not using that efficiently and
[58:22] then you're not going to make it really
[58:24] so now is the time to move towards these
[58:26] these these these energy energy
[58:28] efficient strategies which is basically
[58:30] mining Bitcoin and you and and and and
[58:32] lowering your uh your cost and and and
[58:35] stacking money at the same time it's
[58:37] amazing really cool um last topic what
[58:40] do you think will be the impact uh that
[58:44] Bitcoin will have on on those nation
[58:46] states long
[58:47] term like what like
[58:50] uh what sorry rephrase that uh I'm just
[58:56] wondering um because like I think a
[58:59] Bitcoin world will look a lot different
[59:01] than than than we have the the fear
[59:04] world we have like the war example that
[59:05] we brought on before there a lot of
[59:07] other things happening um and I'm just
[59:10] wondering how a nation state is
[59:14] evolving if they are on a Bitcoin
[59:17] standard so like more than just yeah
[59:20] exactly well
[59:22] I put it this way um I don't think we'll
[59:25] ever see
[59:27] I find it hard to imagine that anyone
[59:29] around the world they'll be able to ever
[59:30] introduce a new fiat currency given that
[59:33] bitcoin's about and I think I'm very
[59:36] bullish on that aspect that that now we
[59:40] understand what what money is and any
[59:43] Central Bank out there is would be silly
[59:46] to try and start a fat currency right
[59:47] now because that's going to be that's
[59:49] going to fail at at the go at the
[59:52] start I think now is the time that you
[59:55] that countries what you'll see I mean
[59:58] you'll see I mean we're talk it's how to
[60:00] rephrase this that if we're on the
[60:02] Bitcoin standard then I
[60:04] think you yeah I don't know how else to
[60:07] say but it's you will see so much
[60:10] improvements within countries that are
[60:11] using Bitcoin Bitcoin not only but also
[60:15] using Bitcoin to back their their Fiat
[60:16] currencies you're going to see so much
[60:18] progression that's true like that there
[60:20] will be a lot I'm so interested just in
[60:22] that topic of like how how we on on so
[60:26] many different levels how are we as
[60:28] human civilization as nation states as
[60:31] as individuals just like changing
[60:34] because of Bitcoin because there was
[60:35] that one conversations that happening
[60:37] that you know the brick currencies were
[60:39] going to start their own their own
[60:41] current uh currency the brick countries
[60:44] sorry were going to start their own
[60:45] currency over the last few years
[60:47] especially given what under the Biden
[60:49] Administration and and and there was
[60:52] no few there was no efforts to make any
[60:55] peace
[60:56] that they thought the brick countries
[60:58] people were talking about the brick
[60:59] countries are going to break away and
[61:00] create their own uh they were going to
[61:02] have a much more B uh much more uh
[61:05] polarized World in that respect and that
[61:07] they might even move towards making
[61:08] their own currency I think that's that's
[61:10] very that obviously less less less of a
[61:13] chance now but there was always
[61:16] flawed um that any country that wants to
[61:18] start its own Reserve like its own
[61:20] currency right now it's it it doesn't
[61:23] favor country especially if you're a
[61:26] country that are a that are net exporter
[61:28] of goods and there's some good Bitcoin
[61:31] is talking about this some Peruvian bull
[61:33] was one who mentioned that um there's a
[61:36] cing dilemma happening with with
[61:38] countries with the resource rich
[61:39] countries if they want to create their
[61:41] own their own currency then they would
[61:43] have to then export they would have to
[61:45] import more than export given that if
[61:48] you have your own Reserve Curr currency
[61:50] you're going to have to export that
[61:51] currency so you're going to create
[61:53] inflation so you're going to have to
[61:54] import more so it doesn't work out for
[61:57] them so at the end of at the end of the
[61:59] day that's why America became such a big
[62:01] um a big consumer country because they
[62:03] had to export dollars but in order to to
[62:05] balance their inflation they had to
[62:07] import a lot so it doesn't work out you
[62:10] know that's why being a reserve Curr
[62:12] currency is not a really good not really
[62:15] good geopolitical move I believe and
[62:19] this is why people when they study more
[62:20] they will end up settling on on a
[62:22] decentralized currency like what gold
[62:24] was for 5,000 years but now we have
[62:26] Bitcoin and Bitcoin
[62:28] is just a lot a lot more efficient and
[62:31] uh and practical than gold as as a as a
[62:34] as a as a
[62:36] currency yeah a lot yeah uh really cool
[62:40] um we we have one question that to ask
[62:43] each and every one of my qu uh of my
[62:45] guests and the question is what can we
[62:47] learn from you besides Bitcoin well
[62:50] given that I'm a prince I guess I'm
[62:53] going to push for for moniki as a better
[62:55] system as a better governance system
[62:57] than
[62:58] democracy but that's another
[63:01] conversation I I think we went into that
[63:05] a little bit in the first part like in
[63:07] the in the in the first round I'm not
[63:10] 100% sure but I'm fairly sure that we
[63:13] covered that a little bit last time so
[63:15] if if people are interested you you can
[63:17] check out the the first interview we did
[63:19] with you uh on on on this this channel I
[63:22] think there's like a segment in the like
[63:24] 10 20 minutes where actually talked
[63:26] about that topic if I'm not completely
[63:29] mistaken maybe we talked about it
[63:30] afterwards and not recorded but I'm
[63:33] definitely sure that I talked with you
[63:34] already on that topic we probably did
[63:36] one thing maybe I would like to talk
[63:38] about is how how important family
[63:40] is for why for the foundation of
[63:43] civilization we all talk about Bitcoin
[63:46] how low time preference we all we all
[63:48] understand the concept of low time
[63:50] preference and given a lot of Bitcoin as
[63:52] are
[63:53] Libertarians uh I think we have to dive
[63:56] deeper into that and understand that yes
[63:59] we can be very much individuals but and
[64:02] we don't we we like we don't like like
[64:06] rulers but we like rules in that
[64:10] respect
[64:11] um and what I was trying what I'm trying
[64:14] to get at is like like that why Family
[64:16] Matters
[64:18] and basically family acts as a sort of
[64:21] natural pre-political unit that like
[64:23] Fosters low time preference
[64:26] and it helps us understand that we helps
[64:30] us value the future over the pre present
[64:32] basically parents like save and
[64:34] sacrifice for their children passing
[64:37] down wealth values and discipline and
[64:39] this is what really is fundamental to
[64:42] the to building strong stable productive
[64:45] societies and
[64:46] civilization and why I'm getting to this
[64:48] because recently I I've just finished
[64:50] completing the book democracy the god
[64:52] that fil by Hans Herman Harper and there
[64:55] was a lot of insights a lot of lot of
[64:58] things in that book that I can relate to
[65:00] and his book is goes under the premise
[65:03] that
[65:04] uh that
[65:06] democracy that there's three systems out
[65:09] there there's democracy monarchy and
[65:11] natural order and he says out of all of
[65:13] those democracy is the most
[65:15] flawed monarchy is better and obviously
[65:18] natural order is the way forward
[65:21] and given that I'm a prince and stuff I
[65:23] kind of like that
[65:26] uh and but he talked about and this is
[65:28] something as what what monarchs always
[65:30] tend to to to advocate for is strong
[65:33] family values and tradition and that's
[65:36] one thing I would I always like to point
[65:39] out and and I think that a lot of
[65:42] instances like democracy has a way of
[65:44] like undermining families by by
[65:47] replacing their
[65:48] role replacing the role of the family
[65:51] with the state uh you have welfare Pro
[65:53] welfare programs public education and
[65:56] all these Progressive policies that kind
[65:57] of keep contining eroding at parental
[66:01] Authority and they incentivize
[66:03] dependency on the states and I think
[66:06] it's really important that we go back to
[66:08] being more traditional more family
[66:09] orientated because that links nicely
[66:11] with with individual property rights
[66:13] with strong individual property rights
[66:14] IND it links strongly with our sense of
[66:17] of belonging our sense of uh of
[66:21] of of traditional family values and I
[66:24] think that's really important important
[66:26] for for a lot of bitcoiners that we
[66:28] don't strave too much of being
[66:30] individuals that we have to that we
[66:32] really have to understand that family is
[66:35] number one it's what keeps us United as
[66:38] uh as humans really I mean I love that I
[66:42] love that that that's that's really good
[66:45] and and that's also what what I I hear a
[66:48] lot about from from Bitcoins I think
[66:50] this family values and those uh those
[66:54] values are really
[66:56] ingrained in in the Bitcoin DNA for for
[66:58] for some reason that's one thing I see
[67:00] is a lot of a lot of Bitcoin is having a
[67:02] lot of babies and more so in my other
[67:04] friends circles you know when you speak
[67:06] to bitcoin if they've got like two three
[67:08] four five six babies or something or
[67:10] kids it's fantastic to see because you
[67:13] understand I mean that's what that's
[67:14] what Bitcoin is
[67:15] it's that's what family family is low
[67:18] time preference family is we Bitcoin is
[67:21] a very future oriented people and this
[67:24] is this is what's beautiful about what
[67:26] I've learned so much becoming a Bitcoin
[67:27] and I wasn't so much like that uh five
[67:30] six years ago um yeah my son now he's
[67:33] just turned seven and um but also when I
[67:35] had my son it was a tied in the time
[67:37] when I first discovered about Bitcoin
[67:40] and it made me much more traditional
[67:42] much more conservative in a good way and
[67:45] it turned me towards being more
[67:46] religious more more of a Christian
[67:48] getting in touch more of my Orthodox
[67:50] route and understanding that natural
[67:52] hierarchy is is so Paramount to to a to
[67:56] a uh to a stable society and it's it's
[68:01] this is how we raise responsible adults
[68:05] individuals is through
[68:07] family so yeah it's something that I've
[68:09] been really touching on recently and I'm
[68:11] really it's really beautiful subject to
[68:14] to see and I'm just really happy that
[68:16] you know that this is something that
[68:18] I've finally found that I feel very
[68:19] comfortable with and it's made me very
[68:21] calm and and and and very hopeful about
[68:23] the future and now we have a tool
[68:25] Bitcoin that helps facilitate this and
[68:28] it's very Paramount to to to re
[68:30] civilizing our society that's gone
[68:32] through a huge dis civilization process
[68:34] over the last 100 years since the the
[68:37] birth of Fiat currencies and and all its
[68:42] degeneracy that happens as a result of
[68:44] and now we're starting to more people
[68:46] waking up to the fact that and we need
[68:48] to get back to a hard money standard and
[68:50] that helps us civilize
[68:53] again I love that that that's very
[68:55] beautiful I think that's a uh also
[68:58] perfect ending for the podcast we have
[69:00] one more thing uh our end routine where
[69:03] the previous guest is asking a question
[69:04] for the next guest without knowing who
[69:06] the next guest actually is and it's it's
[69:07] a fun it's a fun question you probably
[69:10] won't answer it truthfully um the
[69:13] question is what are your 12 seed
[69:16] wordss oh that's good I I don't take
[69:19] responsibility for that
[69:21] question 12 seed wordss okay that's good
[69:24] it can be anything really
[69:26] um I want to show this to people uh
[69:29] quickly at the end uh because I
[69:31] mentioned it before uh if people want to
[69:33] hear more about you uh we had exactly
[69:36] around about one year ago uh our first
[69:38] conversation and I think it was really
[69:40] good uh and we touched on the monchy
[69:43] part and and some of really cool other
[69:45] things also I think we touched on your
[69:49] uh Discovery journey of of how you
[69:51] discover Bitcoin and and the shitcoin
[69:52] phase and stuff like that so that that
[69:54] was that was a fun discussion if if
[69:56] people are still hungry for more content
