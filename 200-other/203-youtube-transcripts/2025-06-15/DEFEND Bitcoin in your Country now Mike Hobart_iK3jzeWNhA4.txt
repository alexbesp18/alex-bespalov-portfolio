[00:00] I have no intention of running from a fight I 
have no intention of fleeing to El Salvador I  
[00:05] would rather stick around and fight things out 
okay Elizabeth you can talk all you can spread  
[00:11] all the flood you want but you're literally just 
strengthening it pushing Bitcoin developers and  
[00:15] operators and I'm sure there's plenty of Bitcoin 
miners that have been spooked in the last couple  
[00:19] of years that have gone offshore that's bad for 
America but it's good for Bitcoin like you can't  
[00:24] stop the money going to good ideas and and good 
projects and then you're incentivizing those  
[00:29] good projects getting access to really cheap and 
available power 99% of the global population is  
[00:35] not on board yet the boat is still empty there's 
a lot of room to grow hi Mike how you doing I'm  
[00:41] doing great Robin thanks for uh I appreciate you 
inviting me on to to talk I had an opportunity  
[00:46] to um check out your page a little bit I saw that 
you've had some pretty great guests on you've had  
[00:52] a friend of mine Lisa on on your podcast I believe 
if I'm not mistaken um then uh I was listening  
[01:00] a little bit of the Peter Dunlap you've had some 
you've had some pretty solid uh pretty solid  
[01:04] guests on recently so like I'm looking forward to 
seeing what kind of questions and conversations  
[01:09] we can we can spark up here yeah it's it's it's 
fascinating I was coming into the podcast scene  
[01:14] and I was like really stressed out like who will 
come on my podcast in December and actually bitco  
[01:21] have a pretty open and generous they like you 
reach out to them say like hey you got to be  
[01:25] on my podcast I have a new podcast nobody's 
listening to it but please be a guest of mine  
[01:30] and the actually come on and this thing is growing 
uh rapidly I come close to the 4,000 subscribers  
[01:36] on YouTube and even also on the podcast platforms 
um slowly slowly growing but yeah but anyways uh  
[01:43] the actual topic Bitcoin today um and I try 
to always start with like big questions and  
[01:49] trying to get out like what's what's your take 
on bitcoin and okay for you is like the question  
[01:54] today is like what is for you personally the 
most exciting part of of Bitcoin like what  
[02:00] you most excited about Bitcoin okay um I dude I 
love this question because there's as you know  
[02:08] and as a lot of your uh viewers will know there's 
when it comes to bitcoin itself the asset or the  
[02:15] network there's so many facets of it that make it 
valuable to multiple different um populations and  
[02:22] multiple different regions and multiple different 
sectors uh that you everybody's going to have like  
[02:28] their own kind of answer and my answer I think 
is a little bit different from almost a large  
[02:35] portion of other individuals that are like big 
personalities are just as outwardly spoken as  
[02:40] myself um what I'm most excited about when it 
comes to like the whole Bitcoin conversation  
[02:49] is that and this is this is also going to be 
similar to like what I kind of talked about  
[02:54] with digital Wildcats is that like the money 
stuff is awesome like don't get me wrong like  
[02:58] the investment thesis for Bitcoin is awesome 
um the protections of savings is awesome but  
[03:06] I think that probably the the what's going to 
impact people even greater than like just like  
[03:13] the savings aspect is going to be the relationship 
that Bitcoin mining has with energy generation and  
[03:22] the energy sector the reason for that is that 
when you when you look at how everything is  
[03:30] in today's world everything is Downstream from the 
cost of production and like the cost of generating  
[03:37] and distributing power right and Bitcoin 
mining was the first thing to really purely  
[03:47] and neutrally incentivize just broad spectrum 
energy generation and or energy accumulation and  
[03:55] power generation right so like the and what I'm 
getting at is that like I and I want to invite I  
[04:01] want to invite you and the and your listeners to 
kind of consider when we're looking at something  
[04:07] like a like a power grid right like with all the 
power lines and the the distribution um like the  
[04:13] Distribution Systems like the Transformers and the 
uh substations and the natural gas plants nuclear  
[04:19] plants hydrop plants like the the the entire the 
whole shet right um when it comes to expanding  
[04:26] that ecosystem you have to get we have to look 
at it in the sense of so like we have cities and  
[04:32] countries that are growing at a relatively like 
you can tight like when you're looking at a city  
[04:37] or a country you can kind of relatively accurately 
project or forecast how quickly it's going to be  
[04:44] expanding right like it's a pretty smooth like 
kind of like it's got some hills and everything  
[04:49] but it's a pretty smooth line up and to the right 
um unfortunately expanding infrastructure doesn't  
[04:56] seem to kind of Follow That same line like you 
can't really afford do like you're going to it's  
[05:01] going to be more of a step function right like 
you're going to expand power and generation up  
[05:04] to a point you're going to keep it flat for 
a while it's going to be a step function then  
[05:07] you're going to expand it up and then it's going 
to go up like that so like you got like when if  
[05:11] you're looking at it on a chart you got the step 
function with the um with the kind of like average  
[05:17] line curve of of growth and expansion kind of 
like touching the the Peaks or the the bottoms  
[05:22] of the steps right like the little like line like 
that um when it comes when you incorporate Bitcoin  
[05:29] in into the conversation you have now brought in a 
relationship of where the demand for power is now  
[05:41] Perpetual it's 247 365 it doesn't fluctuate or it 
doesn't have to fluctuate like normal Power Demand  
[05:50] on an infrastructure grd is um and in doing so 
you can eff you can effectively expand power power  
[06:00] distribution and power generation infrastructure 
Way Beyond what the immediate demands of of the  
[06:06] entire like Society or local community is 
currently and so and in doing so because  
[06:12] you're providing a an economic relationship to 
where these power producers and power generators  
[06:17] power Distributors are capable of continuously 
making money still because they're earning  
[06:22] Bitcoin from their efforts um you can effectively 
bring the cost of power down aggressively because  
[06:29] they're not just solely relying on the amount 
of power that you or I are paying to the utility  
[06:34] company and now that's all theoretical right 
like I'm not I'm not a class I'm not a like  
[06:41] a civil engineer I'm not um I didn't go to 
college for engineering or physics I would  
[06:47] to call it for exercise science so but like the I 
think that like there just isn't it's not getting  
[06:54] enough attention in my opinion it's not getting 
enough um appreciation for Bitcoin mining does to  
[07:01] the relationship of society in general cuz like 
when when we're talking when we're talking about  
[07:08] disrupting that kind of relationship in a very 
positive way for the average individual you're  
[07:13] bringing the cost of energy down right which 
isn't just like paying for all the lights and  
[07:18] the Wi-Fi and the routers and stuff doesn't just 
become cheaper you start looking at the cost for  
[07:25] um companies and goods to be produced can start 
to come down down right because like the when  
[07:32] the relationship first starts like don't get me 
wrong but the corporations and the big companies  
[07:36] they're currently like they'll be able to take 
advantage of things like almost immediately  
[07:40] their margins will probably will be able to go 
up quickly but it's going to allow for new ideas  
[07:47] to be cheaply made and then distributed quickly 
like that's where things get really interesting  
[07:52] then you couple that with the relationship of of 
Bitcoin and like how it's um you can't stop it you  
[07:59] can't stop the the Commerce that's being done on 
bitcoin you get this really interesting ecosystem  
[08:04] where like you can't stop the money going to 
good ideas in in good projects and then you're  
[08:10] incentivizing those good projects getting access 
to really cheap and available power like that's a  
[08:16] future that I'm excited for and on top of that the 
the money aspects comes in where when everybody  
[08:22] holds every company and every individual holds 
their money in Bitcoin then they also get like  
[08:29] more purchasing power over time y That's like an 
an additional kind of I mean it was a little bit  
[08:35] in there already I feel like this is like an 
underrated discussion anyways in in in Bitcoin  
[08:41] because when you have Bitcoin all the costs are 
coming down eventually the electricity part is  
[08:46] like extremely fascinating for me and also 
really hard for me to wrap the head around  
[08:51] I also had the discussion with your friend Lisa 
about that uh she has a big claim like monetizing  
[08:57] every molecule which is fascinating you see that 
companies are paying actually money to get away  
[09:03] with energy excess energy that they have they 
can actually just make money out of that when  
[09:09] they turn on the Bitcoin miners but they don't do 
it because of reasons um which is fascinating for  
[09:16] me that uh they're not doing that and uh this 
energy uh topic is not too much talked about I  
[09:25] feel like that could be a massive uh adoption 
wave coming do you also see like as as Lisa  
[09:31] that uh this energy uh debate could be like the 
next wave of massive adoption when a lot of new  
[09:38] energy producers actually come in and see all of 
the sudden this Bitcoin play with the energy part  
[09:44] and then maybe also discover the monetary part 
and maybe also do go like a micro strategy route  
[09:50] where they putting on the balance sheet and and uh 
stuff like that oh dude without a doubt like I I  
[09:56] the conversations that I've had offline or private 
there are serious discussions being had within the  
[10:03] US Department of energy um I know of a project 
that is going to be coming online or that is like  
[10:10] is in the planning stage now for a new nuclear 
reactor that is going to be immediately serviced  
[10:17] or supported by Bitcoin mining um as part of like 
as part of like the core aspect of the project um  
[10:25] there's um serious stuff going on with like the 
the wind and solar discussion um I get like and  
[10:32] like ignore the tribalistic stuff between like 
the the green energy and like the fossil fuel  
[10:37] stuff or like hydrocarbons was more accurately put 
um because in my opinion like the the best thing  
[10:44] for Humanity is just like we're generating power 
in whatever way we can as as constantly as we can  
[10:50] and as um as potent as we can just to get like 
the flow of electrons out there drive the cost of  
[10:56] power down right um and just like having diverse 
sources like that between nuclear oil or you don't  
[11:01] really use oil for power but nuclear natural gas 
um you have heating oil I guess you could put that  
[11:07] in there wind solar Hydro um all these things 
are going to be good ideas like like they all  
[11:14] have their their place in the ecosystem because 
they're just going to diversify between all the  
[11:18] different forms like they're going to e and flow 
and everything and that's awesome but I yeah like  
[11:24] to your like to a point you made like a lot of 
these companies like they don't want to touch  
[11:28] the whole Bitcoin or Bitcoin mining topic just 
because you know reasons as you put it like it's  
[11:34] it's largely just kind of like um it's almost like 
a taboo topic right like and the Elizabeth Warren  
[11:40] of the world have done a pretty relatively good 
job of just kind of like seeding the fear of the  
[11:47] whole conversation by the the average um citizen 
um kind of like the whole Reefer Madness did with  
[11:53] like the whole marijuana topic um but like we're 
getting to the point of where like the like just  
[11:59] the consistent conversations like we're having now 
of like just based in logic and rationale and fact  
[12:06] and Truth is like it's like you you can't beat 
those kinds of conversations um because anything  
[12:12] else outside of that is Reliant upon lies and of 
like on our side is is time right because like if  
[12:19] your argument is based solely off lies you your 
time is against you because then the more people  
[12:24] that find out the truth the more people that 
think things through logically the more that  
[12:28] like that that power system arose that's being 
supportive All Eyes um and I there I've had I've  
[12:38] had plenty of other conversations as far as like 
the Bitcoin mining and energy topic that um people  
[12:43] don't really fully grasp because they can't see 
like it's not out in public like um for example  
[12:53] with the simply Bitcoin guys um last year around 
June or July when the whole like Black Rock stuff  
[12:59] started like coming out Black Rock started like 
talking more positively about Bitcoin I have I  
[13:05] still hold the theory that I think that black rock 
largely got orange pilled because of the oil and  
[13:10] gas industry because of my experiences with um 
when I was working for Great American Mining and  
[13:15] helping out out the field out there with like 
deployments and re like and just like putting  
[13:20] in new as6 and everything the the Big Oil guys 
out there in North Dakota in the back end Basin  
[13:25] like they were all dabbling with Bitcoin money and 
that was two years ago now and they had been doing  
[13:32] it since 2017 like it's all out there it's just 
it's just private like they're they're keeping  
[13:37] Hush Hush about it for good reason because um one 
of the things that I talked about Great American  
[13:42] Mining and with the the relationship with oil and 
gas and Bitcoin mining is that when we're talking  
[13:48] about um pumping oil out of the ground or you 
could say releasing oil out of the ground you're  
[13:53] going to get a lot of natural gas along with it 
it's just part of the natural it's just part of  
[13:58] the the the relationship when oil is there there's 
off often times more often than not there's going  
[14:03] to be Associated natural gas and that relationship 
can produce pressure right and you utilize that  
[14:11] pressure to get the oil up out and now a lot of 
these companies whether it's BP or Chevron or  
[14:18] shell or um conico Phillips or uh any of these 
other like big big big wig oil producers or any  
[14:28] of the guys that are out in the Middle East with 
the United Arab Emirates um if you're going to get  
[14:35] something like natural gas you you you want to 
make an economic use of it right um often times  
[14:40] that and with natural gas that means piping it 
in gas form or and you set it off to the market  
[14:48] or like a harbor to to be transported wherever 
or you you liquefy it which requires significant  
[14:54] amount of work in order to freeze it then you 
put it in a massively pressurized container  
[14:59] and then you ship it that way to wherever it's 
it's going to be M like making the market right  
[15:04] um both of those options are extremely expensive 
because every couple hundred miles if you're going  
[15:09] to if you're going to pipe out the gas you have 
to have a uh pressure station which is going to  
[15:14] repressurize the system to keep the gas flowly 
um that all that's obviously expensive so like  
[15:19] if the either of those two options are not deemed 
economical by these um producers then the other  
[15:25] options are to vent it or to flare it right 
and venting is just letting it off into the  
[15:30] atmosphere and that's where gets a lot of the um 
environmentalists kind of up in a hub up which you  
[15:35] know I I'm not saying that they're wrong for it 
just throwing this Stu up in the air is generally  
[15:40] probably not a great idea um or they're flaring it 
which can consume uh a good amount of the gas of  
[15:48] the the noxious fumes like the methanes and stuff 
that everybody is so concerned about but that you  
[15:53] have dist they have disruption by weather right 
because if the wind is blowing at a particular  
[15:58] rate it's going to affect how much of that flame 
actually consumes that gas um so this is where  
[16:05] Bitcoin mining fit into that relationship is 
instead of sending it out through a pipe or  
[16:11] liquefying it or venting it out or flaring it you 
run it through after it's been filtered you run it  
[16:17] through a natural a generator that consumes that 
natural gas trans it into electricity and then you  
[16:23] use that electricity to produce Bitcoin mining or 
produce Bitcoin right through Bitcoin mining and  
[16:29] and the interesting thing that we saw with great 
American mining was that when we were bringing on  
[16:35] bitcoin miners onto these oil and gas operations 
by consuming this natural gas and consuming it at  
[16:41] a consistent rate and like monitoring things and 
making sure we were keeping a good like 95 99%  
[16:46] uptime um we were effectively allowing those oil 
and gas operations to pump more oil while also  
[16:53] less like impacting the environment in a negative 
way less right that's nothing but winds that's  
[17:00] winds across the board like everybody wants more 
oil everybody wants less like methane getting up  
[17:05] in the atmosphere everybody wants more Bitcoin 
right like there's no there's no lose a there um  
[17:12] so things like that are happening in the US right 
now um they're also happening in the Middle East  
[17:17] and North Africa really aggressively um we've 
seen the things with Bitcoin mining and hydro  
[17:24] with I believe it was Bhutan right like they 
have I think like like a bill dollar operation  
[17:30] or something like that going on um we have like 
the hydroelectric that's going on with like great  
[17:35] fosses involved and Canada um I believe there's 
maybe another one in the northwest of the United  
[17:42] States um then we have the nuclear stuff that's 
being tested with clean spark um and Tera wolf or  
[17:49] was it Tera wolf is that a tera wolf or standard 
power it might have been it might have been uh one  
[17:53] or two or the both I can't I I I can't keep track 
anymore but the thing the point is after this long  
[17:59] kind of like rant or Diet tribe is that the 
relationship with Bitcoin mining and the the  
[18:06] entire broader energy sector is very bullish it's 
being had in a number of different rooms um in  
[18:15] various serious manners and just nobody nobody 
like the general public just doesn't know it's  
[18:23] just it's not in front of cameras um it's not 
being touched on by Elizabeth Warren because  
[18:28] she doesn't care she's ignorant and she like she 
doesn't know what she doesn't know um but yeah  
[18:34] I I am extremely bullish on what Bitcoin mining 
and the energy relationship is going to be doing  
[18:39] to society over the next couple of decades do do 
you feel that uh Bitcoin mining becomes too much  
[18:46] of a specialized uh operation I mean we saw that 
uh that it does not matter that much because in  
[18:52] 2017 with the blocks Wars also like I feel like 
over 90% of the miners were on the different side  
[18:59] uh actually the than than we the current current 
bitcoin that we have so miners are not that much  
[19:05] in control of the network that uh that most think 
uh but Bitcoin miner mining has become a quite  
[19:12] specialized operation like the facilities are 
getting bigger and and and and and really good  
[19:19] and if you really want to have a Mining facility 
you basically have to like have some some order  
[19:26] to get cheap electricity uh there are a lot of 
interesting applications where you just like put  
[19:32] some solar roofs on your on your house might as 
well just also put a minor there if you sometimes  
[19:38] have too much energy storing it is sometimes 
inefficient uh maybe is it storing in the Bitcoin  
[19:44] Miners and using the financial energy is is is 
a better way they are like mining heaters small  
[19:50] heaters where you can get the electricity and like 
to like has a household applications um do do you  
[19:57] see like an in future where like every household 
has like Bitcoin miners kind of in integrated or  
[20:02] is it like an in specialized operations where like 
facilities have it or or are you in fear also that  
[20:09] it's too much specialized operations and operated 
only by big big players um that's a good question  
[20:18] I think that the big players right now they're in 
a they're in a Race Against Time um cuz the way  
[20:24] that I see like the whole Bitcoin mining industry 
so part of my background is I spent in my youth I  
[20:32] play a lot of video games right and um I want 
I want uh you and your your audience to kind  
[20:38] of consider what what has happened in the video 
game space between specifically consoles and PC  
[20:44] right because PC was the dominant one for a very 
long time in the last 10 years or so we've been  
[20:51] watching as consoles have been catching up right 
because like the uh the whole technology between  
[20:57] like gpus CPU like that whole relationship the 
advancements that allowed for um the competition  
[21:06] to start like spreading out and being more 
distributed rather than a peak right for like very  
[21:10] specific players to dominate I see the same thing 
happening right now in Bitcoin money um the more  
[21:18] different groups that get exposed to asex um like 
especially with how Michael sailor recently talked  
[21:24] about them as being better for processing than 
gpus or CPUs and like in very specific formats  
[21:31] um we're going to start seeing that Innovation 
leading to a dissemination or democratization  
[21:38] of the whole Bitcoin mining sector we're going to 
we're going to get to the point like the the big  
[21:44] big Industrial Level operations are going to 
dominate for a while um they're going to find  
[21:49] their use cases as far as like the marathons and 
the riots where they're effectively they're mining  
[21:53] Bitcoin on the grid but they're they're operating 
as kind of uh Power distributors right so when  
[21:59] like the like down in OT when the grid is on is 
experiencing high demand they can wheel back their  
[22:05] demand so that the GD can disseminate that power 
elsewhere right um I think that we're going to  
[22:12] get to a point where the average home or larger 
homes um will be capable of having maybe maybe  
[22:24] comparable is not the right word but having hash 
rate at at home to the point of where it's not  
[22:33] it's not worse than partaking in the in the like 
the Powerball or the lottery to try and like win  
[22:39] some of the um the Bitcoin subsidy from each block 
and that will that will help distribute things um  
[22:47] I also think that we're going to be I think that 
what's also happening with Bitcoin mining and that  
[22:52] whole relationship like you're talking about 
with like the specialization and everything I  
[22:56] think that a lot of people are also witnessing and 
finding use cases for other forms of technology  
[23:04] right as far as like utilizing um the power 
distribution relationship and uh incentivizing  
[23:11] individuals to be able to um redirect their power 
consumption for other means right um I think that  
[23:21] uh there's a lot going on like suly with the 
the home solar panel example that you brought up  
[23:28] I think that um cuz like when the solar panel 
stuff first started people were realizing like  
[23:34] oh if I have a big enough roof and I have enough 
panels I can literally make money off of it by  
[23:42] selling it back to the grid some municipalities 
caught onto that and they didn't like it right  
[23:47] like they're like no no no no no no like we we do 
that you don't do that you you there none of that  
[23:52] is going to be happening I think that that's 
going to incentivize we're probably going to  
[23:57] be seeing States um if we haven't already I I 
I don't have enough time to actually I don't  
[24:02] enough bandwidth to I keep up on all this stuff 
but if we haven't yet we're going to start seeing  
[24:06] states and countries and provinces start to take 
that into their own hands like hey if you move  
[24:12] here we don't care what you're doing if you have 
if you have solar panels or power generation on  
[24:19] your property and you produce more than what you 
need you can absolutely sell it to the grid like  
[24:26] that kind of relationship will abs absolutely be 
happening and then that's going to incentivize  
[24:31] like the redistribution of people right like the 
immigration and immigration conversation um that  
[24:36] will help further strengthen the decentralization 
of Bitcoin mining because like the other aspect of  
[24:42] like your question with specialization is also the 
centralization question right um I don't know if  
[24:48] you had any intentions of talking about Elizabeth 
Warren but like I'm I I kind of want to touch on  
[24:53] it I think that Elizabeth Warren is honestly one 
of the best champions for Bitcoin and Bitcoin  
[25:01] mining and she has no idea why um I think that the 
recent kind of like fears stoked around Bitcoin  
[25:11] mining and trying to ban it with all the stuff 
that's going on with all the nonsense going on  
[25:16] including what's happening with like the samurai 
team um and pushing Bitcoin uh developers and  
[25:23] operators and I'm sure there's plenty of Bitcoin 
miners that have been spooked in the last couple  
[25:27] of years that have gone offshore um that's bad 
for America but it's good for Bitcoin right in  
[25:34] the sense of like okay Elizabeth you can you can 
talk all you can spread all the flood you want but  
[25:39] you're literally just strengthening it like you 
you you clearly have no inkling or understanding  
[25:45] of how this operates like like Bitcoin Bitcoin 
mining and Bitcoin the asset or like the the  
[25:51] um Bitcoins themselves they're already centrally 
located in the US spread it out more by all means  
[25:58] be my guest like I don't think we need let compl 
about that I I mean the same thing happened 2021  
[26:04] with China where like before 2021 a lot of mining 
power a lot of hash rate was actually in China  
[26:10] what was the think like 69 70 like it was a really 
high up at least 55% yeah it was a really high up  
[26:17] uh and then they cracked down on it and the only 
thing that happened is was like a a short spike  
[26:23] down and after like three weeks or something 
like that the mining hash R was back up again  
[26:28] uh at the same rate but it was more distributed 
and now in in China what is there like 10% maybe  
[26:35] they still didn't get rid of it because Bitcoin 
mining is just uh you cannot get rid of it like  
[26:41] there will be Bitcoin miners in your country if 
you want or not uh but you can actually contribute  
[26:47] to the decentralization of the Bitcoin network 
uh so thank you China and thank you Elizabeth for  
[26:53] that exactly uh talk talking about sensorization 
um a lot of a lot of talks were also around the  
[27:03] Bitcoin ETFs and black rocks involvement I mean 
obviously Everybody's Free To Buy Bitcoin also  
[27:08] Black Rock so like there's there's no no fear in 
in that mind for me but there are a lot of fears  
[27:15] around like more and more people are carding 
their Bitcoin with black rock more and more  
[27:20] people with coinbase they have a huge number 
of of users now because of uh the ETFs also um  
[27:28] first of all like how did you saw the the Bitcoin 
death rolling out where you're surprised or not  
[27:33] surprised by by the the price action that did did 
not happen after that I mean we had the high we  
[27:40] had the alltime high before the Haring which never 
happened before but uh people are expecting much  
[27:46] more than that uh but people also like like it's 
just Bitcoin ETF it will have a long-term impact  
[27:51] not a short-term impact like what's your whole uh 
opinion and take on on the Bitcoin ETF this year  
[27:58] yeah I think the ETF was inevitable um the whole 
ETF conversation was happening back in 2017 um  
[28:06] that was when I first like got involved that was 
when I first came to bitcoin um that was where my  
[28:11] journey started ETFs were inevitable the financial 
producing financialization like products that  
[28:18] are going to claim to custody Bitcoin were always 
going to be inevitable when it comes to the uh so  
[28:26] how would we put it the I get like maybe morality 
um would be a word for um what the ETS are doing  
[28:34] to individuals gaining exposure to bitcoin price 
appreciation uh it's it's going to sound really  
[28:41] boring it's not particularly polarizing um but 
I don't necessarily see a negative in it I don't  
[28:47] like I see a negative in the in the sense of like 
yeah like people aren't actually custody their own  
[28:54] Bitcoin yes that's definitely a negative like it's 
not yours all this other stuff I I I hear you on  
[29:00] that um but it's also allowing people to get their 
feet wet with Bitcoin that never would have gotten  
[29:05] their feet wet before like cuz if people can't get 
exposure to it in their their Ira or through their  
[29:12] fund manager they don't care they don't want 
to touch it like why would they right it's not  
[29:17] something that has been around for centuries and 
centuries across multiple different civilizations  
[29:23] across the planet like something like gold I 
guess people have been exposed to Gold since  
[29:28] were kids for Generations like there's when 
it comes to when it comes to um like the the  
[29:35] whole Bitcoin conversation around being frustrated 
with people not understanding or taking the time  
[29:41] to understand like guys like when we're talking 
about Bitcoin like we all know like how much like  
[29:47] the Fiat hamster wheel sucks but we also have to 
be aware of how much of the population is stuck  
[29:53] on that thing right if you're stuck on the theat 
hamster wheel you don't have a whole lot of time  
[29:58] to do a whole lot of research right like you're 
a lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck  
[30:03] here in America they don't like and trying to 
raise kids at the same time or trying to go to  
[30:08] college or doing both or all three like there's 
no time there and then like to have something  
[30:15] like Bitcoin that it takes a while to grasp like 
most of almost all of us took at least three touch  
[30:21] points to like finally get it right like it 
took three touch points for me to get Bitcoin  
[30:26] but then it took me like another 2 years before I 
actually like before the whole Bitcoin mining and  
[30:32] energy relationship clicked so that's like that's 
like 4 years of time and I I'm an individual that  
[30:38] had spe like like a significant amount of time 
in that period like I had my time in the Army I  
[30:43] had the time on deployment well which those of 
you that have been in the Army you're going to  
[30:47] know there's a lot of a lot of hurry up and wait 
right so like there's a lot of time to just like  
[30:52] sit and listen to podcasts like uh Marty bet 
um most people don't have that kind of time  
[30:58] um so when it comes to the frustrations around 
the ETF I understand it but like everybody like  
[31:03] needs to like just chill and give people the grace 
and kind of like understanding that uh 99% of the  
[31:10] population is just starting to get their feet wet 
like they're just starting to get their toes wet  
[31:14] like they're not even like their whole foot isn't 
even then yet so I think that the ETF conversation  
[31:21] is mostly positive um but there is going to be 
an event or a number of events where those ETFs  
[31:31] are going to go down the route of uh FTX and and 
s bank and freak right there there's going to be  
[31:37] ETFs that are claiming that they have the Bitcoin 
that they do not people are going to get burned  
[31:42] people are going to lose the asset that they 
thought they had um there's also going to be  
[31:47] events in the sense of hacks and everything like 
else um I think that there's probably something  
[31:53] in coinbase's future because there hasn't been 
something significant yet that usually means that  
[31:58] they uh that an organization like that is missing 
something right because pain is pain and loss are  
[32:04] the greatest teachers in all of reality when 
somebody hasn't experienced it yet there's  
[32:10] going to be something that they're not paying 
attention to um so that should cause concern  
[32:16] for anybody that has Bitcoin custody with coinbase 
in the sense of hey start looking in the cold card  
[32:23] start looking into wallets start looking into 
like responsible management your keys um get  
[32:29] that get whatever portion you can afford to live 
with out of there to protect yourself because um  
[32:36] like your conversation with Peter Dunlap the 
the future for Bitcoin is very bright and very  
[32:41] high as far as like the pricing in Fiat terms 
um CU like the other thing to consider like I  
[32:50] mentioned earlier 99% of the global population is 
not on board yet like the boat is still empty like  
[32:58] there's there's a lot of room to grow if you are 
listening to this podcast you might be wondering  
[33:03] what is actually the setup look like of Robin or 
how can I improve my Bitcoin setup and there's  
[33:09] two things you have to buy Bitcoin from the 
right source and you have to store Bitcoin  
[33:13] the right way let's focus on the first thing how 
to buy Bitcoin it's simple have a Bitcoin only  
[33:19] exchange don't deal with the shitcoin exchanges 
don't deal with an exchange that has an own token  
[33:24] or something like that be on a Bitcoin only 
exchange app I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is  
[33:30] for me the best partner for that and now where 
do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin should be stored  
[33:36] on a hardware wallet on a self custody solution 
where you yourself hold your keys and it should  
[33:43] be a cold wallet so that's my Simple Solutions 
that's a bitbox you just put your Bitcoin on  
[33:50] there back up your seat fras and you are better 
than 95% of all Bitcoin hodlers if you have  
[33:57] more than ,000 in Bitcoin it's an absolutely must 
have one last thing before we get back to the  
[34:03] video I'm really passionate about meeting other 
bitcoiners and there's an amazing opportunity in  
[34:09] middle of Europe in June the Bitcoin BR conference 
it's the best and biggest Bitcoin only conference  
[34:17] in whole of Europe for all Americans please 
visit Europe and visit this place in June for  
[34:23] all europees it's a must go anyways you so close 
to the Bitcoin PR conference you basically have to  
[34:29] come I will do interviews there and I would love 
to meet you all there use code Robin for all my  
[34:36] sponsors to get discounts and use the links down 
in the description yeah definitely and I feel like  
[34:42] um people don't get that we need education uh I 
myself needed when the first time I heard Bitcoin  
[34:49] I needed three years to get around from it's a 
scam do it might be something I needed three years  
[34:56] and in those three years was in school uh and 
I had a lot of time to research I was an active  
[35:01] stock investor researching about new stocks every 
week so I had like at least 10 20 hours every week  
[35:09] just to research and I made good money in in the 
stock market uh but I always dismissed uh Bitcoin  
[35:16] so you first need the attention of people and the 
attention you get with Bitcoin deaths you get it  
[35:22] with with uh big things also with Michael sailor 
that comes in was the first public literat company  
[35:27] to by Bitcoin there's a lot of uh mainstream 
action that we need to get the attention and  
[35:33] then we can educate people but as you say I 
love it uh as you said that people don't even  
[35:38] have their toes wet like they starting to come 
in slowly slowly like we are in the very very  
[35:44] early stage and people often get a little bit too 
I feel like impatient like people ask me like oh  
[35:51] why are we not at 1 million or 10 million already 
like lower your time preference uh be patient  
[35:57] and as like educate people one by one like 
this this this thing takes time we this is  
[36:02] a revolution a monetary Revolution that will take 
place over a very long time and has a huge impact  
[36:10] on on society so yeah I like uh how you think 
about it uh on that topic uh and you also have  
[36:17] like an an an military background and you have 
the podcast also with the the Bitcoin veterans  
[36:23] what do you think an impact on our individual 
freedom when we have like the first time asset  
[36:30] that has property rights an asset that nobody 
can actually take from you even if they shoot  
[36:36] you uh which is amazing to think because usually 
like with Force you can take everything like if  
[36:41] they have a bar of gold they can come to you and 
just take it from you if they don't want to you  
[36:46] can shoot them and then you have the bar of gold 
Bitcoin you actually can take in your heads to  
[36:51] your crave which is an amazing concept uh what 
do you think with with your experience in in in  
[36:59] the military with your background um what will 
Bitcoin do for our individual Freedom dude I I  
[37:08] think you could tell by the way I was reacting 
I love this question um so I think that uh what  
[37:15] Bitcoin is doing and what it's going to do for 
individual freedom is probably the the biggest  
[37:21] thing or the biggest benefit to supporting 
individual Freedom that has happened since  
[37:27] 1776 or since the printing press um the the the 
big because the big thing with the printing press  
[37:34] was the the freedom of distribution of idea right 
like the um I don't think the American Revolution  
[37:43] or the French Revolution would have been able 
to happen without the distribution of ideas  
[37:48] that came from the printing press um being able 
to share philosophical ideas around like the the  
[37:54] contemplations of Freedom the value of freedom 
and um what it can enable for a society would  
[38:01] not have happened without it and I think that the 
way that say like like you mentioned the the the  
[38:09] I would what I like to call the spiteful ownership 
of Bitcoin is something that has never existed in  
[38:15] human history ever like the fact that just like 
that example that you gave the mere fact that you  
[38:21] can own something and you can literally take it to 
your grave and if you custody it to the point of  
[38:27] where like it's Reliance upon memory and you're 
not exposed to uh sodium what is it bicarbonate  
[38:34] or whatever like the truth serum that actually 
does exist if you're not exposed to something  
[38:38] like that you don't diffuse your uh your your keys 
over to somebody against uh quote unquote against  
[38:44] your will you take that to your grave nobody's 
getting that like that is not something that has  
[38:50] ever existed ever like the only thing that has 
ever existed like that was ideas like the great  
[38:56] things that Nicola Tesla thought of that he took 
to his grade that he never wrote out right um and  
[39:02] nicholet Tess was also a great example with those 
actually because he had so so many ideas that were  
[39:06] written down on paper that were uh confiscated 
once he died uh when he to stay in that hotel room  
[39:12] so the fact that that has never existed before 
the fact that you can you can keep assets and  
[39:20] purchasing power from a tyrannical government or 
a a individual or organization that would do evil  
[39:28] onto you and to others and they can't get anything 
out of it like that's that's a game theoretical  
[39:35] relationship that is massive because then at that 
point if if that if if plunder is not a um is not  
[39:43] an equitable or valuable strategy what's left the 
only thing that's left is cooperation right you  
[39:51] got either you can either you can try to coers 
or you can cooperate and I think that we would  
[39:56] all agree is especially right now with what's 
going on across the world cooperation is in  
[40:01] everybody else's um best interest rather than 
just plundering each other for no good reason  
[40:09] other than to support the Fiat system and like if 
you guys have listened if any of your listeners or  
[40:15] if you yourself have listened to any of like the 
Bitcoin veterans podcast we talk about that pretty  
[40:19] agnosia like the the fact that uh looking through 
American history basically since World War II we  
[40:27] learned that um war is great for business right 
with all of the bandages the bombs and the bullets  
[40:37] uh small groups of the population are capable of 
making outsize gains um and all that they have  
[40:43] to do is take life elsewhere and that's a problem 
like that's a that's that's not great for the for  
[40:49] the species in general um and then there's also 
the fact that like as many of us know blood be  
[40:55] gets blood right like there there's no there's no 
winning in war everybody loses um so like when you  
[41:01] have like all this like like these relationships 
together just like with the energy sector when  
[41:06] you have all these relationships together with the 
cooperation the the custody you you start to see  
[41:12] a brighter future ahead and I think that that's 
what a lot of that's that's what a lot of like us  
[41:17] bitcoiners really really appreciate is that the 
more that you dig in the more that you see that  
[41:23] there's an incentive system here to produce more 
power which um incentivizes human flourishing um  
[41:30] there is more incentive to cooperate and work 
together which incentivizes human flourishing  
[41:36] and the entire system uh the whole the way that 
the Bitcoin Economics work is that good ideas are  
[41:43] going to get funded which incentivizes human 
flourishing versus what's going on with the  
[41:48] canian um economic system of the Fiat ballar to 
where as long as you're buddied up um politically  
[41:55] or whatever to the money pritter you're going 
to get access to it regardless of whether the  
[41:59] idea is good or not like all this Dei what I would 
argue um socialist uh strategies like there's like  
[42:08] the The Good the the good ideas and the bad ideas 
have like quote unquote equal access to the money  
[42:14] printer but then you incorporate the political 
affiliation and it starts to slide more to the  
[42:19] bad ideas get more access to money and that's a 
problem a huge problem I feel like uh it's like  
[42:27] I mean let's not get started on that but I feel 
like when you when you have soft money if you  
[42:32] have like a money BR some Central uh organization 
some Central Authority that all of the sudden can  
[42:40] play God with the world uh it always goes the 
wrong direction even if it goes good for 100  
[42:47] years because some miraculous Superman was on the 
power even if it actually goes good that's just a  
[42:53] matter of time that it goes dramatically wrong and 
and absolute power ABS uh corrupts absolutely so  
[43:01] yeah it's it's it's fascinating to see that the 
the the system already lives for for that long  
[43:07] and it it did not came down till now like it it 
comes down but it did not come down completely uh  
[43:13] which is is also fascinating for me you mentioned 
the the podcast the Bitcoin veterans podcast um  
[43:19] I guess the the main goal of that is also like 
spreading the message uh about Bitcoin and and  
[43:25] in that sphere uh did you learn from from the 
experience that having that podcast something  
[43:32] special like is there something that you took away 
from having those podcast episodes and like if you  
[43:39] already also interview people uh was your takeaway 
from from your own podcast I've I've learned that  
[43:48] um to to my appreciation that there are far more 
um brothers and sisters in arms in the the US  
[43:59] military they're much more like ready to like have 
conversations around like say for example just  
[44:04] what is money right um when I was when I was going 
through the whole kind of like dating exposure to  
[44:11] the whole Bitcoin conversation doing my research 
and reading and everything um my entire unit was  
[44:18] not open to it at all like there was maybe 
a handful of us that were looking into it at  
[44:22] the same time but everybody was like no like the 
dollar is the dollar the dollar is King the dollar  
[44:27] is America like all this kind of stuff right and 
I think the last four years in particular in the  
[44:33] United States have well and Western Europe in 
the entire world have exposed a lot of people  
[44:39] to the fact of like oh okay maybe what's going on 
with the dollar is not necessarily um American or  
[44:46] patriotic right because one of the things that 
I noticed in that in my time in the military  
[44:51] was that if you questioned the morality of what 
the American Military or for what the US dollar  
[44:58] was being used for it like there was like there 
was a canyon that was jumped it was just like  
[45:04] oh so you're against America like you're against 
Freedom it's like no like that that's ridiculous  
[45:08] like to say that uh to say it's something 
like um using the US military or using the  
[45:14] intelligence apparatus to incentivize you know say 
for example a couet of another country to supplant  
[45:21] a leadership so that they were more susceptible to 
working with America rather than having a diplom  
[45:27] itic and capitalist and mertile relationship of 
like hey like we get you do things differently  
[45:32] but let's work together on like one initiative um 
that to me is more American than the um than the  
[45:40] opposite right and like so that has been that 
particular angle has been really enlightening  
[45:45] for me in a lot in a lot of good ways and 
another thing too is that one of the reasons  
[45:53] why we started the podcast was that we also um 
the group of us the five of us we also noticed  
[45:58] that there is a large lacking of quality kind of 
like discussions around leadership and masculinity  
[46:07] in the entire developed World um there I know 
from my personal experience that there are a  
[46:15] lot of individuals particularly men that have not 
grown up with access to great um Role Models um  
[46:21] or that the individuals that they thought were 
great role models were in fact not right like  
[46:26] they're championing um ridiculous uh philosophies 
like womanizing and stuff like that like no like  
[46:33] there isn't a whole lot of winning in a society 
where like we have a bunch of men that think that  
[46:37] they need to like just sleep around and not 
actually try and like produce a family and uh  
[46:43] have that nuclear relationship where you're 
developing good members of uh that are going  
[46:47] to be part of your Society um so that's another 
aspect and then obviously I bring the whole kind  
[46:52] of Health conversation to the table which we 
I don't think we've had that conversation yet  
[46:58] which um I very much intend to with regards to 
making sure we have more Americans and it's now  
[47:04] getting into uh to Europe with uh the Europeans 
and everything of like hey like we need to start  
[47:10] taking if you're not taking your health seriously 
it's time to start now like it's never too late to  
[47:15] start taking your house seriously um so we're 
we're attempting to accomplish like multiple  
[47:20] objectives all at once with the Bitcoin veterans 
podcast on top of the entire Bitcoin conversation  
[47:27] I love it uh one one question I think like when 
whenever the the topic of masculinity comes up  
[47:33] I feel like masculinity is such a word that 
gets thrown around so much in the internet it  
[47:38] and often it gets attached to the wrong things 
um what does it mean uh to be masculine like  
[47:46] what's masculinity for you like do you have like 
a definition for that or like a a kind of like a  
[47:53] guide for that what what this means yeah I have a 
I have a General structure um and it is primarily  
[48:00] it's going to be rooted mostly in stoicism which 
is a a Phil like a wing of philosophy for those  
[48:07] that haven't had exposure to it um stoicism is 
largely think of guys like Marcus orelus um the  
[48:14] senas which would be senica the younger and senica 
the older um Arthur schopenhauer had some good  
[48:20] stuff uh in my opinion Frederick bastiat which 
he's not necessarily A stoicist but um guys like  
[48:27] that so my general structure is that like when it 
comes to masculinity is that someone who embodies  
[48:35] masculinity whether it's a man or a woman because 
technically women can also be masculine too um  
[48:40] somebody that is constantly developing themsel 
to have access and acquire more power but to  
[48:50] the extent of where they're using that power for 
either protection of themselves or like family  
[48:58] or loved ones or their Community or they are 
using that power to further benefit themselves  
[49:05] or their loved ones or their Community now the 
the um you're I'm sure you did and then I'm sure  
[49:12] you're your listeners are going to be like well 
you could use power negatively to like just like  
[49:17] benefit just the self and not anybody else right 
it's like yeah that's that's very true um when it  
[49:23] comes to masculinity it's a double-edged sword 
just like anything else um so and the other the  
[49:29] other thing when it comes to to masculinity in my 
opinion too is that um using that power and that  
[49:36] acquisition of power and and when I think of power 
and acquiring power I think of self-development  
[49:41] like in knowledge and experience and uh skills and 
capability um the thing the big thing about that  
[49:48] power is to also make sure it's not weaponized 
or let loose in irrational or emotional ways  
[49:57] right like we like we don't want um a bunch of 
guys to have access and skills to the point of  
[50:05] where you know they're capable inflicting violence 
or some form of fashion to the point of where they  
[50:10] get challenged they have an emotional outburst 
and then they cause significant harm and damage  
[50:15] to others when all they needed to do was cool 
off that's not that's not masculine masculine is  
[50:21] the the the um what's the like the proverb or the 
the philosophy of like you want to it's better to  
[50:28] be a warrior and a garden than a gardener of the 
war right like that's that's the basic gist of it  
[50:34] have the capability to express ex like significant 
or Extreme Measures of power but keep that power  
[50:43] sheet right until it's necessary like that's the 
thing and that's that's a beautiful uh description  
[50:50] of it uh I think I heard it I feel like I 
think Jordan Peterson was uh who talked about  
[50:56] that uh a lot and he talked about uh being the 
strong man that you could punch someone in the  
[51:05] face and he instantly falls to the ground but 
not being the one that actually does it because  
[51:11] you have self-discipline uh over yourself to not 
do it and actually then cool off but still being  
[51:18] to have this ability and control that ability 
that's true self-discipline because he talked  
[51:24] about self-discipline and masculinity in that 
cont text because if you don't have power like  
[51:29] self-discipline is really easy for you but if you 
have power if you have the power to actually punch  
[51:34] someone in the face uh and and it would end up 
good for you because the one is not two times  
[51:41] bigger than you uh and still not do it that's 
like true self-discipline and this is a little  
[51:47] bit also like what what you talked about I love it 
how you define it um even though it has not a lot  
[51:53] with to do with Bitcoin uh but I feel like it's 
bed I would I would argue that it it it does um  
[52:01] because when it comes to like just think of like 
the amount of wealth and purchasing power that a  
[52:09] lot of our Bitcoin compatriots are going to be 
acquiring or the next years or decades there's  
[52:16] going to be a lot of individuals that are going 
to have the capability to do things that do not  
[52:20] benefit others so that negatively impact others 
right and that's going to be where where the  
[52:26] the discipline portion comes in right like um 
not necessarily funding certain things or um  
[52:35] or just using that those funds or th those those 
capabilities to benefit others where maybe you're  
[52:42] not necessarily getting a whole lot of out of 
like out of it immediately right like like being  
[52:47] able like if you're an individual with a lot 
of purchasing power and you notice that like  
[52:53] say something some sort of economic difficulty 
Falls onto your country like maybe say an economic  
[52:58] depression and you have funds and capabilities to 
produce something that provides more power than  
[53:05] you need and you can provide Power to others you 
can do that but you'll also have the capability  
[53:11] to do that and not provided to others to the 
point of where you become like effectively a  
[53:15] JP morgate where it's like okay I built the power 
now pay me or you're not getting access to it like  
[53:22] stuff like that like so like it it still very 
much does touch the whole Bitcoin conversation  
[53:27] and it's uh also goes in the direction where like 
when we actually are in this future where Bitcoin  
[53:34] is so valuable because it became the base layer 
of our financial system it's the global Reserve  
[53:38] asset uh and stuff like that then individuals that 
now actually had their self- discipline to hold on  
[53:45] to their power for so long and actually still 
have it in like 10 years 15 years uh they have  
[53:51] a big responsibility and I feel like bitcoiners 
in general like I rarely met a bitcoiner who has  
[53:59] bad intentions uh and uh most of the bitcoiners 
are really true givers and through um just kind  
[54:07] people in general uh so I feel like that could 
uh also impact the world in a positive way uh  
[54:14] to because Bitcoin rewards to people that are 
uh early on very curious uh and and want to  
[54:21] like better the world to to a certain extent 
which will which is interesting to think about  
[54:26] uh but yeah um for the end of the before we start 
to the end of the podcast I want to know what are  
[54:32] you currently extremely passionate about that we 
not touched on till now like what's what's outside  
[54:39] of of Bitcoin and outside of the topics that we 
we touched on the day is there any passion that  
[54:46] you have is there anything that you're currently 
learning deeply or recently yeah so um again I  
[54:53] love this question you have great questions um I 
have three things so one is uh something that uh  
[55:00] anybody who follows me already is already going 
to know um I'm really passionate about the health  
[55:05] and fitness area like I said I went to college for 
science um certified personal trainer like I'm all  
[55:11] about like everybody man or woman lift heavy like 
get up to get into the gym start moving around  
[55:19] some iron like it's good for you the more that we 
have a strong healthy population we have a strong  
[55:24] healthy Community we have a strong healthy economy 
we have a strong healthy country and primarily  
[55:31] here in America we don't have that we don't really 
have any of that honestly like it's like the the  
[55:37] entire system is so fragile because the average 
individual is so fragile that um we have a series  
[55:43] a serious uh a serious series of vulnerabilities 
that need to be addressed and I think like the  
[55:50] ground level is getting all the moms and dads 
and the future moms and dads into working out  
[55:56] to be healthy to take their nutrition seriously 
and to treat their bodies like a true Temple to  
[56:01] where they're built like I want those bodies built 
out of granite not out of sticks and twigs like  
[56:05] the stronger the temple the better for everybody 
else um another passion of mine is something I've  
[56:12] talked about a little bit I haven't really talked 
about a whole lot is that and I'm working on  
[56:17] writing a book about is that I personally believe 
we are going through the early Innings of the  
[56:23] second like Global Renaissance um the first one 
kind of touched on before with like the printing  
[56:29] press and the exchange of ideas um I think that 
what we're witnessing right now um with Bitcoin  
[56:37] and with the like what we talked about earlier 
with the relationship of Bitcoin mining and energy  
[56:41] and the incentiv incentivization of broad spectrum 
aggressive energy infrastructure expansion and  
[56:48] growth is going to result in the next Renaissance 
that is going to bring out all sorts of new ideas  
[56:57] um and it's going to be coupled with um artificial 
intelligence I can guarantee that um there's a lot  
[57:04] of there's a lot of uh emotionally and 
politically charged conversation around  
[57:08] artificial intelligence a lot of it is based in 
Merit in my opinion um there's a lot of evil that  
[57:14] is capable of of of being expressed because of 
artificial intelligence but there's also in my  
[57:20] what I would argue a lot more good that is capable 
of coming out of it um cuz like the the whole like  
[57:27] Skynet conversation like we're so far away from 
that like I think people need to just kind of  
[57:32] like calm themselves a little bit so there's the 
whole second Renaissance that I'm super excited  
[57:37] about um hopefully I can get that book wrapped 
up here this year and get it like to some sort  
[57:43] of uh being printed at some point it's going to 
happen I would rather it be sooner than later  
[57:49] but uh hopefully that that's coming in the future 
and then um the last thing that I will say that  
[57:54] is a passion that's probably not really related to 
anything is that I've been digging into um some of  
[58:01] the uh stuff that had to do with the Jonna Kennedy 
presidency and looking into like Alan dois and the  
[58:10] director of Central Intelligence so that that's a 
that's a fun little rabbit hole but hopefully that  
[58:14] doesn't get you shut off uh YouTube too much just 
because I mentioned it usually not like uh YouTube  
[58:20] has been nice to me since since the beginning 
and I had some pretty uh interesting convers  
[58:26] ation already okay so but uh let's see I'm 
just keeping it going till till it breaks  
[58:33] and if it breaks so we'll learn from that and 
and swe sweeten it out for YouTube a little bit  
[58:38] in the future uh but it's really interesting uh 
definitely let me know when the book is out and  
[58:42] let's have you on again and then let's see what 
the book is all about and uh discuss it on the  
[58:47] podcast uh which I also want to do a note like eii 
one and a half years ago or maybe one year ago one  
[58:56] a half years ago and never used AI or like never 
used AI uh intentionally and now I use it every  
[59:04] day for my podcast just for my podcast I use it 
every day multiple times I mean I also have a  
[59:10] daily podcast so I produce every day one but there 
are so many intersections now and uh I feel like I  
[59:18] don't know if I'm already at this point but I feel 
like I'm at like 5050 where I use Google versus AI  
[59:25] so like AI is coming more and more up especially 
for uh preparation uh and getting a little bit of  
[59:32] overview I even have like a small gbt programed 
where I can just type in a name uh and they are  
[59:39] summarizing me uh the whole guest that will come 
on the show give me suggestions for questions and  
[59:45] give me uh links where I can learn more about 
it so this is an amazing tool amazing tool  
[59:51] where I'm like learning about new guests in like 
two minutes uh obviously I'm then going into the  
[59:59] interviews and trying to learn more about it I'm 
using then a YouTube transcript tool to get more  
[60:05] information to the chat tool that from that uh 
interview that one hour interview get get me the  
[60:12] summary of that get me some question out of that 
so like and this is just like a small example I  
[60:17] because I do every day podcast and I'm just one 
person like there's no team behind me uh I have  
[60:23] to be really efficient and EI is fast ating in 
um being more efficient with your time so I love  
[60:31] EI and the tools and I feel like uh EI will not 
take your job but someone with EI will take your  
[60:38] job that's my my fa favorite line always uh that's 
uh that that's how I how I look at it yeah I again  
[60:48] that's that's the other thing too is like with 
the kind of like the the doess around artificial  
[60:52] intelligence um some of is merited like don't 
get me wrong like I said before like some of it  
[60:58] is merited there are going to be jobs are going 
to be lost because of it um but we have to look  
[61:04] at technological Revolutions of the past and again 
again artificial intelligence is not like the the  
[61:11] um other technological revolutions but I'm willing 
to bet that a very similar relationship is going  
[61:18] to result to where artificial intelligence is 
going to allow for efficient like efficiency gains  
[61:24] as far as jobs to get done like you're describing 
now to the point of where others are capable of  
[61:29] producing companies that are going to produce jobs 
for people that are going to like they're going  
[61:35] to be needed anyway it's like cuz like if you look 
at if you look at like the internet or the automob  
[61:41] beal a lot of people were concerned about like 
the stable boys losing jobs um they got more jobs  
[61:49] like because you have to maintain the technology 
when it comes to it right so like there's going  
[61:54] to be more need for develop like cleaning up code 
and all this other stuff there's going to be more  
[61:58] need for individuals maintaining data centers 
that are powering the artificial intelligence  
[62:03] to begin with um so yeah like I like I think 
that I think that like a lot of this stuff is  
[62:10] going to be culminating together to more Bright 
Futures than most people are like are willing to  
[62:15] to Really accept or like conceive of right now and 
on individual level nobody has to be fearful of it  
[62:23] if you're willing to be open if you're willing to 
learn if you're willing to adopt so if you're like  
[62:30] uh um not lazy and just like keep on and and and 
spill up then then then you don't have to fear if  
[62:37] you're just like if you're in a job where you're 
like you can explain this job uh and someone else  
[62:42] could do it in a similar quality after like maybe 
five hours or four hours then then you probably  
[62:48] be will be replaced at some point from a robot or 
maybe like an AI or something like that I don't  
[62:54] know how it goes with physical stuff like also 
the physical robots are getting better and better  
[62:59] I don't know if like building houses or something 
like that is something that humans will do in 50  
[63:04] years uh it's also uh a train to the body but yeah 
we will see I'm I'm really excited about uh where  
[63:12] Ai and Robotics moving uh we have to be careful 
but as you said like this this sket future we are  
[63:20] we are far away from that but we definitely 
have to be uh aware of of the ai's power too  
[63:26] um for for the endro of the podcast uh like we 
have an endro in the podcast where the previous  
[63:31] guest is asking a question for the next guest 
without knowing who the next guest actually is  
[63:36] uh that's fascinating okay it's like a blockchain 
through the through the uh through the different  
[63:41] uh like the the guests are connected like the 
blocks in the blockchain uh I love that concept  
[63:46] I stole it from the diary your CEO uh the the one 
has nothing to do with Bitcoin but I was like for  
[63:52] Bitcoin podcast it's perfect um and the question 
for you is what has to happen in order for you to  
[63:59] move to a different country oh um I don't know 
I don't know if uh probably not going to like  
[64:08] the answer but like I with my my roots being 
in the Army my whole like my whole family on  
[64:14] both sides being uh being soldiers or Sailors 
or Airmen um if I end up in another country  
[64:22] it's going to be because something happened 
in the US the US split into other countries  
[64:26] like I'm like I'm like if if things are going to 
be getting to any sort of like bifurcation um I'm  
[64:33] going to be defending the side that is promoting 
like individual Freedom like so I I'm I'm going to  
[64:39] put it that way um I have no intention of running 
from a fight I have no intention of fleeing to El  
[64:46] Salvador I have thought about it for years um I 
don't want to be known as the one that that ran  
[64:54] away because things that difficult I would rather 
stick around and fight things out with uh with my  
[65:02] Bitcoin veteran like brother and sisters I would 
rather like lock arms and be shoulder-to-shoulder  
[65:07] with some guys that I respect and defend the the 
freedoms that allow for um our women and children  
[65:19] to be capable of like actually chasing their 
dreams into the future I'd rather I'd rather  
[65:24] be doing that um so whoever the the last guest was 
like I'm sorry but I'm not I'm not moving I'm not  
[65:32] fleing this country I love that mind that a lot 
um to close it up thank you Mike for being on the  
[65:38] podcast it was a pleasure talking with you it was 
an amazing hour that we had uh today and uh great  
[65:43] discussion I think uh a lot of people can take a 
lot of uh insights and valuable things from that  
[65:49] discussion uh thank you for being on and thank 
you for taking the time hey man I thank you for  
[65:55] uh for just reaching out to me on Twitter through

people knew exactly how to spell my username like  
[66:36] they couldn't find me so like like therefore 
like your users and you like you guys have  
[66:42] the username to try and track me down um if 
you have any questions just shoot me a DM um  
[66:47] less people reach out to me than you'd expect 
so if you if you have a question or you want  
[66:52] to have a conversation just hit me up most of my 
inboxes filled with BX so I appreciate appreciate  
[66:57] it when a real person is actually trying to 
interact with me I feel like I have to save
[67:01] inbox um and for everybody listening in on 
not Twitter uh mic is like linked down in  
[67:10] the description like just can look 
there and like I will I will link  
[67:14] it and on X it's taged in in in the 
the D like that's that's really easy  
[67:20] uh anyways uh so thank you for being
