[00:00] politicians are also just people they
[00:02] can also see a a value in Bitcoin bring
[00:05] education about money into schools why
[00:08] do we think that an economy needs
[00:10] inflation to function protocols have
[00:13] this network effect that one will end up
[00:16] being the the main one political
[00:18] decisions affect things locally and
[00:21] temporarily while technological changes
[00:23] affect things globally and
[00:26] forever how do you think Bitcoin will
[00:29] change The Narrative around money
[00:32] especially in the
[00:33] mainstream H that's a very big
[00:37] question um Bitcoin is so beautiful
[00:42] because it challenges everything that we
[00:45] have learned so far basically so it's
[00:48] here and um it forces you to ask I would
[00:53] say um simple questions that in reality
[00:57] are not at all simple
[01:00] so not at all I mean I can make some
[01:04] examples what is money what is money
[01:07] actually what was money how does our
[01:10] current monetary system work who has
[01:14] major
[01:15] influence over our monetary
[01:19] system why do you or why do we think
[01:22] that an economy needs inflation to
[01:24] function can inflation be even measured
[01:28] accurately or not what are the
[01:30] advantages and disadvantages of
[01:33] elasticity of the money supply I mean I
[01:35] can go on and on but I with this I want
[01:37] to make the point that um Bitcoin is
[01:41] here Bitcoin now gives you if you want a
[01:45] whole new perspective where you can look
[01:48] at the system that we have now our
[01:51] monetary system from a whole different
[01:54] viewpoints and you can come to also
[01:57] different conclusions because when you
[02:00] have something that forces you to ask
[02:03] new questions automatically you come to
[02:05] different conclusions or usually one
[02:08] example that maybe can be made here is
[02:13] maybe it's very similar to the
[02:16] geocentric model that uh was believed to
[02:20] be true um back in the days where also
[02:24] especially the church said that the
[02:25] earth the earth is at the center of the
[02:28] universe and um and the planets are
[02:31] basically circling around um that was
[02:34] the the the mainstream common knowledge
[02:37] and then scientists and um Galileo also
[02:41] CA came and said people we might have
[02:45] some evidence that this world view is
[02:50] completely wrong and he came up with
[02:52] this what we call now a heliocentric
[02:55] model that not the Earth is at the
[02:57] center um but we Al are just a small
[03:01] planet circling and we're not so
[03:04] important as the church believed to be
[03:07] or us to be yeah I don't know if this
[03:10] answered it but you know what I mean
[03:12] yeah it's fascinating uh people have a
[03:15] heart I me connects even with with
[03:17] Bitcoin because people have a hard time
[03:19] uh humbling themselves like get stepping
[03:22] over their own ego and this was one of
[03:24] my main problems when I came into
[03:25] Bitcoin actually I thought for three
[03:27] years that it was a scam but do you have
[03:30] a background in economy no I did not and
[03:33] this was kind I think it was an
[03:35] advantage because I had um a more clear
[03:39] mind and I went into Bitcoin uh four
[03:42] years ago so I was like 21 or something
[03:44] like that so I did not had a lot of
[03:47] preset in my brain uh but still for
[03:51] three years while I was investing and
[03:54] stocks while I was watching all those
[03:57] stocks and ETFs investors uh on on
[03:59] YouTube Cube I had still this like
[04:01] inflationary mindset a little bit inside
[04:03] of my brain uh and I thought a asset
[04:06] that does not make a cash flow is a scam
[04:10] like I also did not uh know where why
[04:13] gold has any value so for me it was a
[04:16] big step to get into Bitcoin because I
[04:18] thought it's a scam and it changed my
[04:21] view of money a lot like probably also
[04:24] with you that that your did Bitcoin
[04:26] change your view of of Bitcoin more from
[04:28] like inflationary mindset to like an
[04:30] Austrian economics mindset so um maybe
[04:33] just briefly from my background so the
[04:36] also the audience um knows so I my
[04:39] background is completely um focused on
[04:42] molecular biology so I did my my
[04:45] bachelor actually in in Austria in in
[04:47] Vienna focusing on biom medicine and
[04:50] biotechnology and then I moved to to
[04:53] Switzerland um and I did my masters in
[04:57] also Molecular Health Sciences the
[04:59] master is called and now and now and now
[05:01] I'm in my fifth year um of PhD focusing
[05:05] on um skin research so skin inflammation
[05:08] and with this I would like to say that
[05:10] um my knowledge about our financial
[05:13] system about money in general was
[05:15] literally zero maybe I would even say
[05:18] minus one because I I never asked uh
[05:23] questions like this so I was forced to
[05:27] look into this why
[05:30] because I did not understand why I even
[05:33] have to invest to transfer my purchasing
[05:37] power into the future so you have to
[05:39] imagine um the yeah I can briefly
[05:43] describe the situation so as a PhD yeah
[05:46] also in Switzerland um you you are
[05:50] actually below the actual minimum wage
[05:52] or in general I would say if you are in
[05:54] Academia you don't do it for uh monetary
[05:57] reasons but you do it for for passion
[06:00] and um love for for Science and and your
[06:04] field um but I you end up being like
[06:08] around 30 and then you have your degree
[06:11] but what do you do right so I always
[06:14] tried to be kind of try to save try to
[06:18] put money aside for my future for
[06:21] potential family and for for dreams that
[06:23] you have as an individual and and then
[06:26] this was um the time where there were
[06:28] also negative interest rates and you had
[06:31] to pay the bank and there were so really
[06:34] like to me strange fees where I was like
[06:37] how can this be I mean and and people
[06:39] were talking around me all the time yeah
[06:42] you have to um let the money work for
[06:44] you uh invest it um you have to
[06:48] basically broad broadly diversify to
[06:52] minimize risk and um this triggered me
[06:55] so much that I went down the rabbit hole
[06:58] of um investing so really really deep
[07:01] trying to figure out um what do I need
[07:03] to do um how can I do it um what is the
[07:07] possibility to do it also paying less
[07:09] fees and so on and then the conclusion
[07:11] usually is um index fonds go with index
[07:15] fonds broaden diversify and so on and
[07:18] then I discovered crypto and also with
[07:22] crypto I was again like what is this you
[07:24] know what is all of all these Dogecoin
[07:28] Shibu blah blah blah blah and stuff like
[07:30] that and then I tried um as I usually do
[07:33] to um systematically work my way um down
[07:38] the the lad and I started with um with
[07:42] Bitcoin and uh yeah I never never
[07:44] stopped with Bitcoin because uh Bitcoin
[07:47] then as I said previously
[07:51] forced myself to answer answer questions
[07:54] that I did not previously ask and I
[07:58] understood things much much better I
[08:02] would even say yeah that's fascinating
[08:05] for me that you so you did not had any
[08:07] outco coin
[08:08] phase yes it's I had very briefly uh
[08:13] because the
[08:14] diversification um message was so strong
[08:18] into my into my brain um that it made
[08:22] sense to me uh back in the days not
[08:25] understanding that this is a a protocol
[08:27] technology and usually Pro protols have
[08:30] this network effect that one will end up
[08:34] being the the main one especially when
[08:36] we talk about protocols or Ledger like
[08:39] money um so yeah I had it uh very
[08:43] briefly um but yeah I would say couple
[08:47] of months and and then I really focused
[08:49] on on trying also to really understand
[08:52] what it is yeah do you still have like
[08:54] this diversification in
[08:57] mind so
[09:00] that's also a very good question because
[09:02] here it's also the question how
[09:04] convinced you are about one thing right
[09:07] so and the question is also how you set
[09:11] up yourself do you now sell all your
[09:13] ETFs and all the rest and you go all
[09:15] into Bitcoin um this is every every
[09:18] person should of course decide for
[09:21] themselves um but I didn't do that so
[09:25] also kind of opportunistic maybe because
[09:28] when you divers ETFs you are uh still um
[09:32] supporting and uh this not disagreeing
[09:36] with our system that is currently um how
[09:40] it's currently functioning um but crypto
[09:44] I completely ignored and focused on on
[09:47] bitcoin only yeah yeah it's it's it's
[09:50] really cool uh because I had this
[09:53] diversification mindset not really uh
[09:55] like I always understood um if you want
[09:58] to get
[09:59] somewhere you have to focus on one thing
[10:02] or like maximum two things uh and if you
[10:06] want to maintain things then you want to
[10:08] uh diversify more because then you want
[10:12] to diversify your risks but what if
[10:15] there's an asset where there is no real
[10:17] risk involved like when you have a stock
[10:19] you're always like okay what if the CEO
[10:22] goes like he dies or what if the
[10:25] management team makes a bad decision or
[10:27] what if this product a new launch fails
[10:30] so that's why it makes sense if you
[10:33] have hold individual stocks that you
[10:36] hold more than one individual stocks and
[10:38] make like five maybe 10 maybe 20 maybe
[10:41] an ETF something like that but for
[10:44] Bitcoin yeah sorry if I interrupt but I
[10:47] would just rather point to this thing
[10:49] that for me it's even more a question of
[10:52] morality even because if now it's one
[10:55] thing if you think a company is very
[10:57] cool and you like the idea and you want
[10:59] to invest in this company then go for it
[11:02] I mean this is this is how how markets
[11:04] should function but it it's another
[11:06] thing um if you want to just keep your
[11:09] purchasing power over time and you broad
[11:12] it diversify blindly into an ETF because
[11:16] uh what is happening there is that um
[11:19] these ETFs not only ETFs um also um yeah
[11:23] buildings real estate they get a a
[11:25] monetary premium and this monetary
[11:28] premium is there because um money is
[11:30] actually losing a um a Char a very
[11:33] important characteristic and that's the
[11:35] store of value um ability of money and
[11:39] when this is the case and let's make an
[11:42] example now if you then invest in in and
[11:45] broadly Diversified ETFs um you're
[11:48] giving a huge Market advantage of in in
[11:51] those companies that are in these ETFs
[11:54] okay so um they can then use this
[11:57] increase also in their stock price and
[11:59] then again re replay um our the system
[12:04] that we are currently in get cheap cheap
[12:06] cheap debt and um have this huge Market
[12:10] advantage that um others don't have or
[12:13] let's say real estate um real estate is
[12:17] also when it gets a store of value
[12:21] functionality or that's like the main
[12:24] function that it has compared to the
[12:27] function of people needing a roof over a
[12:30] top uh this is not so good also thinking
[12:32] of like resource allocation how much you
[12:35] need to build these homes uh just to
[12:38] then store value and maybe let them even
[12:41] empty what does this do with our
[12:43] resources what how is this you know for
[12:46] our environment and so on so every time
[12:48] money loses the store value ability we
[12:51] have we have an issue because you're
[12:53] forcing people into wordss things that
[12:55] are more scarce and you might also price
[12:58] out indiv idual that need that need this
[13:02] house I mean I can make one brief
[13:04] example um so my family um got a sum of
[13:10] of of a bigger sum of of Fiat money
[13:13] because life insurance I think of of my
[13:15] dad run out or something like this and
[13:17] then there was this question yeah what
[13:19] what do we do what do we do with this
[13:21] money and this should not be a question
[13:23] you should just be able to store at
[13:26] purchasing power over time but then the
[13:29] decision was to buy a second
[13:31] garage even though they just have one
[13:34] car and there is no need for the second
[13:37] garage you you you get my point right so
[13:40] the garage was the better store of value
[13:43] compared to the money and this leads to
[13:48] I would say resour like a a
[13:53] misallocation of resources as well yeah
[13:56] and it leads to an unhealthy Society
[13:58] where everybody is uh not focused on
[14:01] their main thing they try to on the side
[14:04] be in portfolio manager like that's
[14:08] basically what cheap money is doing and
[14:12] this is what I realized actually before
[14:13] Bitcoin because I was quite successful
[14:15] with stock picking and I loved it and I
[14:17] will and I will do it in the future
[14:20] again if Bitcoin becomes more boring
[14:22] because I just have a lot of funing in
[14:24] researching companies and investing in
[14:26] them uh maybe like doing um not public
[14:29] maybe like private something like that
[14:31] uh but back to the
[14:33] point family and friends got interested
[14:36] because they saw money go up technology
[14:39] in the stock market uh and they wanted
[14:42] to know what I'm doing and I held this
[14:45] presentations for like five 10 people
[14:47] and told them what I do but all they
[14:50] wanted to do have is a system where they
[14:53] can just put their financial energy and
[14:56] get it uh rising or like the what they
[14:59] actually wanted is like the same
[15:00] purchasing power over time not not
[15:03] diminishing purchasing power over time
[15:06] uh and this is what I did not understand
[15:08] that Bitcoin is a solution and not
[15:10] trying to educate everybody how to be a
[15:11] stock picker that's like uh but
[15:16] yeah it's that's that's fascinating for
[15:18] me uh maybe like back to the microb uh
[15:21] to the biology um what you studying how
[15:25] did this like change or help you in in
[15:28] understanding Bitcoin some sometimes
[15:30] like you have to when you study
[15:32] something completely different I had had
[15:34] an astrophysicist on my channel and his
[15:37] way of thinking of Bitcoin was really
[15:38] unique how did this study or this
[15:42] process of learning something and help
[15:45] you understand
[15:46] Bitcoin yeah that's a very interesting
[15:48] question because I mean in the end what
[15:52] aome molecular biology is it's um it's a
[15:55] science that you you learn how to ask
[15:59] questions and how to falsify hypothesis
[16:02] so this is one thing that you always do
[16:04] you ask you you have this biological
[16:06] question in mind and then you plan your
[16:09] experiments accordingly to falsify uh
[16:12] your hypothesis this is like the the the
[16:15] core okay and um if you so in other in
[16:20] other words you're my studies gave me a
[16:26] a kind of analytic toolbox that I have
[16:29] now here okay you have can imagine I
[16:32] have my analytical toolbox and this
[16:34] analytical toolbox I can apply to other
[16:39] things and um this is what I did when it
[16:42] comes to trying to understand um what
[16:46] money is or trying to understand the
[16:48] question if an economy needs inflation
[16:52] um or what are the ad advantages and
[16:55] disadvantages of this elasticity of the
[16:57] money supply I try to use my toolbox and
[17:02] answer this question the thing is that
[17:04] in biology or in in Natural Sciences you
[17:08] usually have then a reality because you
[17:10] do an experiment and that's like
[17:11] physical things that or either you can
[17:13] kind of touch or like you know gravity
[17:16] you can describe and stuff like that but
[17:18] in in what I find very interesting in in
[17:21] economy is that um it's not a natural
[17:26] kind of science um so even though we
[17:29] have these um numbers and we have this
[17:33] uh formulas and every time you open a
[17:36] textbook of macroeconomics you're like
[17:38] okay crazy there are so many formulas
[17:41] and and numbers and stuff like that
[17:43] these models are basically based on um
[17:48] yeah based on very intelligent people
[17:49] that came up came up with this models
[17:52] trying to describe human interaction
[17:54] trying to describe um how we are trading
[17:58] with each other
[17:59] and then I I from this back to the mo
[18:02] molecular biology perspective um I can
[18:06] tell you that trying to describe um how
[18:10] cells interact with each other is so
[18:14] complex it's so really like crazy
[18:19] complex that you always need to be kind
[18:21] of handled by um your experimental
[18:25] output or the data that you have okay so
[18:28] you are able to maybe look at this small
[18:30] tiny window of like cellular
[18:33] communication through one protein being
[18:35] secreted interacting to a receptor and
[18:38] signaling good this is a finding but
[18:41] still it's always just you need to be
[18:45] hum kind of humble with this with this
[18:47] data that you have and what I have so
[18:49] this is just my personal thought here I
[18:51] think we um in in in economy sometimes
[18:55] or in these studies we we are forgetting
[18:58] this humbleness we are forgetting um to
[19:02] also try to question this fundamental
[19:05] principles of do we actually need to%
[19:08] inflation just one example doesn't GDP
[19:11] always need to grow or what does this
[19:13] even mean does what does GDP measure is
[19:16] it you know what I mean so it's like
[19:19] those things that um we hear in in in in
[19:22] the news or also in papers and
[19:25] Publications and then we're like okay um
[19:28] d per INF flish that's God given
[19:32] somehow yeah and I think uh they might
[19:35] start to uh get to 3% Target or 4%
[19:40] Target because the 2% inflation will be
[19:42] harder and harder to hit I think uh but
[19:45] that's another topic you also really
[19:47] like you triggered you you said it
[19:50] before with Bitcoin talents uh what what
[19:53] are you doing there and and do you do
[19:55] you do something else also in the
[19:56] Bitcoin community
[19:58] yeah so that's also interesting to how
[20:01] did this all start right somehow I
[20:03] learned to never say no to things in in
[20:06] in the Bitcoin space but everything
[20:08] started with a um presentation that I
[20:12] gave in front of my lab you have to
[20:15] imagine we are around 30 people or so
[20:19] and um we usually have lunch together
[20:22] and in my in my pH where I learned more
[20:25] and more about our monitary system um I
[20:28] was this weird one that um came there
[20:30] and said um yo people today I have a
[20:33] very controversial statement or very
[20:36] controversial topic that I would like to
[20:38] discuss and then we had now 40 50
[20:41] minutes of of this lunch break and I
[20:43] always introduced um these monetary
[20:46] aspects into this crowd of people that
[20:49] are extremely intelligent uh but also
[20:52] have zero background in um yeah in how
[20:56] money works and in in our financial
[20:58] system and um this basically LED so the
[21:02] conversation were extremely engaging so
[21:04] just a couple of examples that that we
[21:07] were discussing one famous one of course
[21:10] um why we left the gold standards this
[21:14] is the question of um or how do how did
[21:17] we even came to this Global Fiat
[21:20] monetary standard that we have now right
[21:22] so as you always need to go back to the
[21:24] previous stages and this was very
[21:26] interesting to see the reaction of the
[21:28] people there right so you your audience
[21:31] will will know this but maybe for for
[21:34] some people um coming in that did not
[21:36] hear this 1971 um basically the US left
[21:41] the gold standard with this Nixon shock
[21:43] uh because they um yeah they they they
[21:46] did not keep this promise uh that they
[21:49] um that they said during the Brad Woods
[21:51] system right so they they said basically
[21:53] that um the dollar will be back by gold
[21:57] but then the Korea Korea War Vietnam War
[22:00] huge infrastructure programs were done
[22:03] also on on that overleveraging the
[22:06] system and then in
[22:08] 1971 um President Nixon said temporarily
[22:11] we will uh break this Peg so this again
[22:15] just explaining them to this explaining
[22:17] this to them and then and they were like
[22:19] okay crazy so this was a political
[22:21] decision one person deciding for yeah
[22:25] plus minus the whole globe uh how the
[22:28] monetary system will change and I was
[22:31] like yeah yeah yes and that you know
[22:34] that it was it's crazy if if you never
[22:36] heard this but going back so this led me
[22:38] then to make a 2hour presentation about
[22:42] all of this all of this information and
[22:45] um it was really good because this
[22:47] presentation I I kept in front of them
[22:50] because every time you know during lunch
[22:51] breaks it's like 30 40 minutes you never
[22:53] have time to really go through all of it
[22:55] so I said please give me 2 hours if
[22:58] you're interested come so in the
[23:00] institution I I booked the room and then
[23:03] people came two hours presentation very
[23:06] nice discussion and the feedback was so
[23:08] good that they decided also to um upload
[23:11] it on YouTube this video then was
[23:14] noticed by two guys near my hometown
[23:17] which was also very interesting so we
[23:19] started a very small Bitcoin podcast in
[23:22] South Duran in this dialect that now
[23:25] sadly is not not continuing but you noce
[23:27] it's always like you add some little bit
[23:30] pieces of knowledge there in this
[23:31] community and so on and this then led me
[23:34] also to the participation of the um
[23:37] Bitcoin talents program that you
[23:39] previously mentioned sorry for taking so
[23:41] long but this is very cool so the the
[23:43] Frankfurt School of Finance um they have
[23:46] different uh programs and one program is
[23:49] this Bitcoin talents program that's
[23:51] Bitcoin only um and I participated in
[23:54] the first cohort uh and I thought this
[23:57] really cool first I was a little bit
[23:59] skeptical is it like about like kind of
[24:01] blockchain or whatever but no it's
[24:04] really about going through this Rabbit
[24:06] Hole um with proper instructions with
[24:10] assignments that you can do individually
[24:13] and that you can then present every time
[24:16] I did this and after that um I also
[24:19] decided to be a mentor there so now I am
[24:21] a mentor for the second and third cohort
[24:24] and this is very interesting because you
[24:26] get people from all around the globe
[24:27] it's in English um I can highly suggest
[24:31] uh if people are interested um to to
[24:34] look at this it now every year I think
[24:36] it takes place and um the cool thing is
[24:39] that you get a piece of paper you get a
[24:43] certificate and as we know um these
[24:46] pieces of paper they in our world sadly
[24:51] or not so sadly they kind of legitimize
[24:54] what you're doing so I decided to do
[24:56] this primarily also for my for my family
[24:59] for my surroundings that always thought
[25:02] that Bitcoin is basically a scam and uh
[25:06] now when you're saying yeah look the the
[25:07] Frankfurt School of Finance is also
[25:09] doing this and they have like a course
[25:12] with the professors being behind um
[25:15] Professor Philip sner that um sadly
[25:17] recently passed away launched all of
[25:20] this um this gives credibility you know
[25:23] this gives cred credibility to to
[25:26] bitcoin and this is why and I did it
[25:28] and this then further cascaded to me and
[25:33] going to also conferences meeting people
[25:35] I was invited um in a German speaking
[25:38] podcast with niiko yil um so if you have
[25:43] someone that is also listening in from
[25:45] the German space they they might know
[25:46] him and then you right so we also kind
[25:49] of communicated over Link in and and and
[25:53] now I'm here and another thing that I
[25:55] almost forgot is um I'm also part this
[25:59] also kind of interesting I'm also part
[26:02] of a of of a movement I would call it a
[26:04] decentralized movement uh called
[26:07] bitcoiners for future and um we take
[26:11] this bottom up Bitcoin approach and
[26:14] combine it with this an environmentalist
[26:18] idea of the Fridays for future movement
[26:21] that is also very known in in in the
[26:23] German space but the main difference is
[26:26] that um we think the change needs to
[26:29] happen in every individual so this
[26:31] bottom up approach with a sound money
[26:34] system that it's actually good for our
[26:37] environment we we can go in into that as
[26:40] well versus the top down approach um
[26:44] with um hoping for political rules and
[26:48] laws that sometimes can even um shoot
[26:51] back if you're listening to this podcast
[26:53] you might be wondering what is actually
[26:55] the setup look like of Robin or how can
[26:58] I improve my Bitcoin setup and there's
[27:00] two things you have to buy Bitcoin from
[27:02] the right source and you have to store
[27:04] Bitcoin the right way let's focus on the
[27:06] first thing how to buy Bitcoin it's
[27:08] simple have a Bitcoin only exchange
[27:11] don't deal with the shitcoin exchanges
[27:13] don't deal with an exchange that has an
[27:15] own token or something like that be on a
[27:17] Bitcoin only exchange I use 21 Bitcoin
[27:20] 21 Bitcoin is for me the best partner
[27:23] for that and now where do you store
[27:26] Bitcoin Bitcoin should be stored on a
[27:28] Hardware wallet on a self custody
[27:31] solution where you yourself hold your
[27:33] keys and it should be a cold wallet so
[27:37] that's my Simple Solutions that's a
[27:39] bitbox you just put your Bitcoin on
[27:42] there back up your seat fras and you are
[27:44] better than 95% of all Bitcoin hodlers
[27:48] if you have more than ,000 in Bitcoin
[27:51] it's a absolutely must have one last
[27:53] thing before we get back to the video
[27:55] I'm really passionate about meeting
[27:57] other Bitcoin corners and there's an
[27:59] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[28:02] in June the Bitcoin BR conference it's
[28:05] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[28:08] conference in whole of Europe for all
[28:10] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[28:13] this place in tune for all europees it's
[28:15] a must go anyways you're so close to the
[28:18] Bitcoin PR conference you basically have
[28:20] to come I will do interviews there and I
[28:23] would love to meet you all there use
[28:25] code Robin for all my sponsor to get
[28:28] discounts and use the links down in the
[28:31] description there there are so many
[28:32] great topics in there in in the short
[28:35] rant that you just gave it gave me um I
[28:38] think with the energy F and education we
[28:42] we might just as well start um I feel
[28:45] like the only thing that holds Bitcoin
[28:49] back uh to not be at the 100% full
[28:52] adoption rate is technology and
[28:54] education technology because we are
[28:57] simply not ready to be a reliable
[28:59] payment system we need layer two layer
[29:01] three technology like I think we still
[29:03] still need applications to be built uh
[29:06] and layer Technologies to be build like
[29:08] we are not in the end phase of we're
[29:10] seeing all the tech there uh which is
[29:13] okay because we are really early still
[29:15] and the second one is just education as
[29:17] you mentioned people just don't
[29:19] understand what money is and they don't
[29:21] understand what Bitcoin is and they
[29:23] don't understand the technology of that
[29:25] and they need to understand all aspects
[29:27] of to actually understand Bitcoin and
[29:29] adopted which makes it hard um so like
[29:35] the question goes in the direction how
[29:37] can we enhance the education part like
[29:40] how can we get monetary education
[29:44] Financial education uh into our society
[29:47] I mean the mentor thing is a great thing
[29:50] uh there is like podcasting is a great
[29:53] thing just speaking about it being
[29:54] willing openly to discuss it uh as you
[29:58] met did it with with your lunch group
[30:00] that's amazing that's what that's the
[30:03] decentralized education that we kind of
[30:05] need uh and uh then after that we can
[30:09] get into like um why the energy f is
[30:12] actually uh useless but let's start with
[30:14] the the education side do you think like
[30:16] is there a chance that we also get the
[30:18] Bitcoin and financial education in our
[30:20] schools uh is there any like how how
[30:22] would you approach it that we get more
[30:24] more uh Financial education and what is
[30:27] money questions in in our new
[30:31] generations very good question so I
[30:34] think first of all um everyone should
[30:37] try on this in this decentralized way
[30:40] right um everyone has working bodies
[30:44] families don't be annoying don't be the
[30:47] weird Bitcoin guy and but just try to uh
[30:51] yeah pointed out sometimes not always
[30:55] and so this ethic is very uh very good
[30:58] second thing is I think um what the
[31:00] Frankford School of Finance um is doing
[31:03] with this B with this Bitcoin dlance
[31:05] program is super cool I think more stuff
[31:07] like this is coming or maybe it's
[31:10] already there and I just don't know
[31:12] about it um what El Salvador is also
[31:15] doing with I think it's called Premier
[31:17] Bitcoin or some or something like this
[31:19] it's right me Premier Bitcoin I think my
[31:23] first Bitcoin is the theed the
[31:25] translation I think yeah so this is also
[31:28] a very perfect example uh where you have
[31:32] education um being done also in schools
[31:37] that's that's that's the key aspect now
[31:39] bringing education about Bitcoin in
[31:42] schools that's very interesting because
[31:45] um with another initiative that where
[31:47] I'm active it's not about bringing
[31:49] Bitcoin into the system but it's
[31:51] bringing education about money in
[31:53] general into the system so this
[31:55] initiative is called it in in German the
[31:58] Bel from morg so the World of Tomorrow
[32:01] and what we are trying there is to um
[32:04] approach politicians in in one or two
[32:07] years with um clear impulses and clear
[32:11] indications what needs to be done and
[32:14] one of this impulse is exactly this
[32:17] bring education about money into schools
[32:21] this is missing completely okay and
[32:24] there and of course the thing is you
[32:26] know it's Al cool to not just learn
[32:29] about Bitcoin I highly Advocate also for
[32:33] people looking into other um views about
[32:38] money so for example don't be no don't
[32:41] just be stuck in this commodity theory
[32:43] of money also look at the credit theory
[32:46] of money Lynn Alden with her book broken
[32:49] money did an amazing job one one thing
[32:53] that in my opinion was missing bringing
[32:55] this bridge together with this views of
[32:58] like the Austrian School I would say
[33:00] focusing more on the commod the
[33:02] commodity theory of money and more the
[33:04] charal list view focusing on the credit
[33:06] theory of money the reality is that both
[33:10] theories have something in common so
[33:12] both theories have something in common
[33:14] that money is a ledger and both theories
[33:17] have also as some some truth behind
[33:20] every time you have a lot of trust in
[33:24] society the credit theory of money made
[33:27] a lot of sense because it was much more
[33:29] efficient to have this Central Authority
[33:31] deciding The Ledger and stuff like that
[33:33] but when trust crumbles then people came
[33:36] to the commodity theory of money so I
[33:38] just with with again with this rant I
[33:41] would like to say um also look into MM
[33:44] you know you have to diversify
[33:46] your thoughts again to this
[33:49] diversification I think diversification
[33:51] of learning is super good to then decide
[33:55] if your argument still is holds holds
[33:58] value or still is like true steel made
[34:00] the other um the other point so again
[34:03] back to the school system bring all of
[34:06] this in bring all of this in and let
[34:08] people individually try to yeah make
[34:11] their own decision about what is really
[34:14] then a good uh monetary system that is
[34:18] good for for humans but not just for
[34:20] humans also for planetary boundaries um
[34:23] and so on and the third point that I
[34:25] want to make is so first um
[34:28] decentralized individuals bringing out
[34:30] the knowledge and starting
[34:33] conversations second of all hoping that
[34:35] this comes into into schools or trying
[34:39] at least and the third one is rather the
[34:43] the thing that is said but that's just
[34:46] true uh we learn through pain humans
[34:50] learn through pain so um if we will
[34:54] experience um also in in the privileged
[34:57] world that our monetary system is is
[35:00] really not functioning um and is
[35:03] starting to have like very high
[35:06] inflation um then people will learn
[35:09] because um yes I I would say error
[35:12] correction is is is this basis of of all
[35:15] intelligence you know we we developed
[35:17] with error correction biology develops
[35:21] with with error correction so that's
[35:23] that's how how things work but let's
[35:25] hope to not come to this point
[35:28] yeah I think pain is is the best learner
[35:33] always I mean we also see the little bit
[35:36] of the Bitcoin adoption where is the
[35:37] Bitcoin adoption the the biggest I think
[35:40] Nigeria was like 30% even greater than
[35:42] in El Salvador where the president is
[35:44] behind it uh so there's like uh the more
[35:49] people need Bitcoin the more they adopt
[35:51] Bitcoin logically and that's why in the
[35:53] west it's still seems like as a luxury
[35:56] product it's the SLE is like oh okay if
[35:58] you have a lot of money then you can buy
[36:00] and diversify a little bit into group to
[36:02] currencies uh which enrages me a lot
[36:05] when when people say like ah Bitcoin is
[36:07] just for rich people no actually not
[36:09] Bitcoin Bitcoin is more for for not rich
[36:13] people because they have uh they need it
[36:16] even more and what drives you actually
[36:18] personally do to do so many so many
[36:20] things in Bitcoin because it's not not
[36:22] your field of studies it's not your
[36:25] professional field actually uh what what
[36:28] drives you to do so many things in
[36:30] Bitcoin yeah yeah as I said actually I'm
[36:33] I'm also I need to do my PhD right so
[36:36] hopefully it will finish uh next year um
[36:40] what drives me um I think it's this
[36:45] inherent feeling of also a little bit
[36:49] knowing that our current system is not
[36:51] so really just it's not so
[36:53] fair and um I think when I'm I'm I'm a
[36:58] person that when I see something that is
[37:01] not fair I I point to it and I don't
[37:05] stop and every time I have the
[37:07] possibility of like pointing towards
[37:10] this even though I know you know this is
[37:13] not so good now Point towards this I do
[37:15] it because I I think it's really unfair
[37:19] in a world where you have around I don't
[37:21] know 160 Fiat currencies or or so uh
[37:25] when you look at how many uh are
[37:28] basically not useful at all outside of
[37:31] their local
[37:33] monopolies um and how also um we have
[37:39] yeah almost like a monetary colonialism
[37:41] with the US dollar being um used to kind
[37:45] of keep the south in in a constant state
[37:49] of development and and if you want to
[37:53] really say it in a strong in a strong
[37:56] term you can say even dead slaves you
[37:59] know having like dead slaves to sustain
[38:03] this this wealth that we have in the in
[38:05] the west I mean I'm I'm a profiteer of
[38:08] the Fiat system I I I completely say
[38:13] this open and loud uh because I was
[38:16] lucky where I was born I was born in in
[38:19] a place where the currency I would say
[38:22] still was still rather stable you know
[38:25] but uh we have
[38:28] around 8 billion of people and the
[38:30] majority lives in situations where you
[38:32] have unstable money or
[38:36] dictatorships uh that can also censor
[38:39] trans transactions and so on so I would
[38:42] say there is this kind of inherent
[38:44] feeling of um there is something that is
[38:47] unfair money is kind of the foundation
[38:50] of um yeah almost every interaction
[38:54] almost every social interaction that's
[38:55] outside of family and friends
[38:58] uh so let's focus on on this foundation
[39:01] and see okay let's objectively see if
[39:04] there are flaws I'm not saying that uh I
[39:08] know 100% that there are flaws I I'm
[39:11] just inviting people to also look at
[39:14] them objectively in an open conversation
[39:18] and discussion and and uh and yeah and
[39:21] come to a conclusion this is why I I I
[39:25] think I'm trying to also yeah I'm active
[39:28] in the space and maybe I will be more
[39:30] active in the future who who knows I
[39:32] will tell and that's and that's amazing
[39:35] you also said like you see something
[39:37] that's unfair you you see the call it
[39:41] field system as unfair a lot of people
[39:43] in the Bitcoin sphere uh me included I
[39:46] also say that inflation in general is
[39:49] theft like the monetary
[39:51] expansion Al always is stealing
[39:55] something from someone and giv this to
[39:57] someone else is that what you mean with
[40:01] unfair so the thing is also about this
[40:05] inflation topic right so first of all
[40:08] how do we Define inflation right now is
[40:10] it just expansion of the money money
[40:12] supply is it the CPI inflation what is
[40:14] it we cannot even like agree on on this
[40:18] point it seems like we cannot agree on
[40:21] this point um but it's clear that it's
[40:24] unfair um in a sense of like you have
[40:27] people being yeah
[40:30] almost kept in a state of constant
[40:34] development to to allow the products
[40:37] that we currently have so our inflation
[40:39] would be would be much much much much
[40:42] higher if you don't have production in
[40:45] whatever Vietnam or in countries where
[40:48] the wages are very low why is this so
[40:51] just you know ask you ask these
[40:53] questions why is this how would it look
[40:56] if we would have one common denominator
[40:59] how would this situation look if there
[41:01] would be one Global Currency where also
[41:05] those people would be able to save um in
[41:09] in this currency would be able to save
[41:11] in in yeah whatever if if it's Bitcoin
[41:13] it's B Bitcoin but you know what I mean
[41:16] that's um that's the thing do you see a
[41:19] future where we come to this like where
[41:22] where we have one Global ruler uh ruler
[41:26] in a sense of measuring our denomination
[41:30] uh and it might be Bitcoin but like the
[41:33] do we come to this conclusion where like
[41:35] fear currencies all those different fear
[41:37] currencies will will die or merge into
[41:40] one Global Reserve currency or asset
[41:43] yeah so I mean I can just speculate
[41:47] right so I think um I we Al so I will
[41:52] not see it in my in my generation I mean
[41:54] we will not see it in our generation I
[41:56] would say say um but I hope I hope
[42:01] because I think a system like this would
[42:03] be fair and I can also try to describe
[42:06] why I think a system like this uh would
[42:08] be uh would be fair so first of all of
[42:11] course then the question is of this
[42:13] denominator is it is it like fixed or
[42:15] not fixed right that's also that that is
[42:17] a important point but let's just first
[42:19] first focus on we have one common
[42:22] denominator um and also bring the
[42:25] perspective of Jeff Boo and many others
[42:29] technologists that are um big in the
[42:32] space but not not only in the Bitcoin
[42:34] space so it is known that um a
[42:39] competitive market without monopolies
[42:42] and with a constant constant increase
[42:44] also in technological development leads
[42:47] to lower prices I mean this this is Jeff
[42:50] wof is still waiting for someone to come
[42:52] no this is this is not true this is
[42:53] false I'm also waiting for someone to
[42:55] come and say no this is not true um I'm
[42:58] I'm still waiting why because if as a
[43:01] consumer you have the chance to U look
[43:04] for different products okay so we are in
[43:06] a competitive market um and you look for
[43:08] a product um you always will choose the
[43:12] option that is um cheaper and maybe also
[43:14] better for you so better quality Al also
[43:17] lower price so this is something that we
[43:19] always do also when we go in the in the
[43:21] grocery store sometimes we we we look at
[43:25] at the bottom shelves right because the
[43:27] those where there is where the prices
[43:28] are cheaper so you look at the bottom
[43:30] shs just one one one analogy here but if
[43:34] this is the case um then prices should
[43:37] be falling to the marginal cost of
[43:40] production and now again going back to
[43:42] this Global denominator so prices would
[43:46] be falling to the marginal cost of
[43:48] production um everywhere so um every
[43:52] every person in this globe uh would kind
[43:56] of profit
[43:57] for if the us or if China has some
[44:01] technological progress that now suddenly
[44:04] we are able to whatever harness en
[44:07] energy much more efficiently and uh put
[44:10] this uh productivity um into um our our
[44:14] work and now there Comes The crucial
[44:17] point of like okay is the measuring
[44:19] stick fixed or can it be um larger or
[44:23] can it be played around with right this
[44:26] is then the the question question of I
[44:28] mean if we would say now inflation the
[44:30] inflationary money supply um this we can
[44:34] also now start to argue or look into
[44:37] it my opinion it's would be fair if this
[44:43] measuring stick stays the same why
[44:47] because the next question is who decides
[44:51] who decides when the measuring stick is
[44:54] enlarged or even shrinked right
[44:58] so there there there are some questions
[45:01] that come up later that we always need
[45:04] to try to answer but we can also learn
[45:06] from history and when we look back in
[45:09] history and there was this
[45:13] denominator usually it ended up that it
[45:17] was if it was was easy to expand um
[45:20] humans try to do this why because it's
[45:24] super nice to get purchase power without
[45:28] needing to to work right without with
[45:32] some kind of tricks and the tricks go
[45:34] back in history you can say one trick
[45:36] was just more more technological
[45:39] innovation allowing us to dig out more
[45:41] salt or allowing us to make more beats
[45:46] and this would was is one trick and the
[45:48] other trick with with coins or coinage
[45:51] is to dilute dilute the commodity so the
[45:55] gold or the silver that is inside the
[45:58] these these coins and so you're
[46:01] expanding this and we always did this so
[46:06] that's the crazy thing Bitcoin brings
[46:09] digital scarcity and this digital
[46:12] scarcity we of course we never had
[46:14] digital scarcity but we never had
[46:16] something that is so scarce in a sense
[46:19] that the supply is is
[46:21] fixed
[46:23] Humanity never had this um because
[46:27] also gold was the thing that is coming
[46:30] closer to bitcoin but um who knows right
[46:33] Elon Musk with his Endeavors in in space
[46:36] if we sooner or later we'll get some
[46:39] gold from space and so the the in
[46:42] inelasticity of Bitcoin again forces you
[46:45] to bring up new questions and these new
[46:49] questions can be just discussed so we
[46:51] never we never lived through a system
[46:54] like this we we have no idea right so
[46:56] one could also argue that elasticity in
[46:59] money sometimes can be um first
[47:02] benevolent so it can be done with a
[47:05] thing that it's needed to do right so
[47:07] you have this catastrophic event and and
[47:12] you are like this institution you or
[47:15] people came into this system of
[47:17] governance and then this Central
[47:19] institution is saying who people we need
[47:22] now to expand this money supply to um
[47:25] combat this but the problem is when you
[47:28] don't ask the people anymore when you're
[47:30] financing stuff with not debt and you
[47:35] have so you're you're basically and
[47:39] putting away the the consensus of okay I
[47:42] pay more taxes to maybe Finance this but
[47:44] you're paying it with with just
[47:46] expansion of the monetary Supply and
[47:48] this is also a thing that happened
[47:50] repeatedly over over the history one
[47:52] example if if I'm ranting now but I
[47:55] would just like bring one example how
[47:57] the um Bank of England um bought up
[48:00] government bonds to finance the first um
[48:04] to enter in the first world war so and
[48:06] the financial times saying that these
[48:08] government this war bonds were basically
[48:11] bought up like like crazy so the
[48:14] population was behind this and 100 years
[48:17] later um people went down into the
[48:19] archives of the bank of England and and
[48:22] and saw that this this this was not true
[48:25] this was not true I think just
[48:27] even one3 was bought up by the
[48:30] population the rest was literally just
[48:33] um financed by the bank of England okay
[48:36] and then the financial time made made
[48:38] this apologies that they reported
[48:41] wrongly but now now I stop ranting but
[48:44] you you see the points right yeah it's a
[48:49] it's it's fascinating to think about it
[48:52] and uh all of like to a certain extent
[48:54] it's all speculation but to certain
[48:57] extent we can also really look at
[48:59] history and uh how money developed and
[49:02] see how Bitcoin actually succeeds in in
[49:05] those environments which leads me to one
[49:07] question that came up to me uh when I
[49:10] was listening to you your Rand in the
[49:11] middle um who will actually benefit the
[49:14] most from Bitcoin like what is there a
[49:17] group of people is there is there some
[49:21] uh some something that you think of when
[49:23] we get to let's let's just say we are
[49:25] getting into the next 150 years to a
[49:29] kind of a full Bitcoin standard Bitcoin
[49:32] is like The Unofficial Global Reserve
[49:34] asset there are still fears around but
[49:36] who will benefit from that the most
[49:38] obvious question is like the early
[49:41] adopters but more broadly do you think
[49:43] there's like a group that benefits uh
[49:46] the most from Bitcoin uh even besides
[49:51] the monetary aspect maybe okay very
[49:54] interesting so into this Pro as if we
[49:57] assume that Bitcoin keeps on being this
[50:00] um this monetary tool that people accept
[50:02] so as you said of course uh first of all
[50:05] the early adopters so the sooner you're
[50:07] in uh the higher the price will go this
[50:11] is this is clear but you're taking also
[50:14] on uh more more risk but now let's think
[50:17] more more
[50:19] broadly um besides the monetary aspect I
[50:23] think one thing that is still very
[50:25] underrated or also very Mis interpreted
[50:29] by um not just media but also a lot of
[50:31] people is this proof of work consensus
[50:34] algorithm and what this will do with um
[50:37] electricity and with electrification and
[50:40] so on um so I'm also very um excited and
[50:44] and bullish about this why because not
[50:47] only have we um invented or have we now
[50:51] discovered who knows right digital
[50:53] scarcity and we also have now a new New
[50:57] Market participant and in this um
[51:01] electricity Market that we did not have
[51:04] before and this is proof of work and
[51:06] basically Bitcoin mining and I want to
[51:09] briefly describe this so it's a you can
[51:12] call it energy taker of Last Resort
[51:16] something like this I would I would call
[51:18] Bitcoin mining why because the
[51:20] incentives for the miners are always to
[51:24] look for the cheapest source of energy
[51:27] okay this is something that um is is
[51:30] completely clear when you look at how
[51:32] the algorithm works and this incentive
[51:36] in combination of miners being kind of
[51:39] local agnostics so they are very mobile
[51:42] and they are also like um they don't
[51:45] have issues of being turned off and on
[51:47] okay so this combination um is new is
[51:50] completely new so um also if you think
[51:53] of other um servers or something like
[51:56] this and or AI that will come and you
[51:59] will not be happy if um suddenly you
[52:03] will have yeah wait 20 minutes because
[52:05] our servers are currently down because
[52:08] there is more demand in the uh in the
[52:10] grid of wherever right so this will not
[52:13] happen for for AI but for Bitcoin mining
[52:17] and its Global adoption this is no issue
[52:20] so you have miners can turn off and on
[52:22] quickly and so this also needs to be
[52:25] taken into account
[52:27] so again going back we have this new um
[52:30] Market
[52:31] participant what will this lead to we
[52:34] can already see some very interesting
[52:37] developments with gridless um gridless
[52:41] um has also this aim to Electrify Africa
[52:44] right so how can this be I mean you have
[52:47] Bitcoin miners that take electricity how
[52:49] can then this lead to electrification of
[52:52] Africa it can happen or it is already
[52:56] happening because you have um structure
[52:59] infrastructure or programs that now are
[53:01] profitable because you have Bitcoin
[53:03] coming in so you can now build up
[53:06] infrastructure there because you have
[53:08] Bitcoin miners saying okay we can make
[53:11] this profitable for you and in addition
[53:13] you have small local regions that can
[53:15] profit from this and then the
[53:18] interesting point is okay imagine now
[53:21] this local regions get bigger uh and
[53:25] they have than other industry
[53:27] and they demand this um electricity what
[53:30] happens the miners if there is more
[53:33] demand suddenly the the price of
[53:35] electricity is rising so they luckily
[53:38] they are local agnostic so they can move
[53:40] again so they will look again for other
[53:43] cheap electricity sources one point the
[53:46] next point is um the combination with
[53:48] renewable energies so in Europe I mean
[53:51] you you noce just the when you look at
[53:53] the news so one big aim is to now um go
[53:59] basically completely renewable and how
[54:03] they the Europe Europeans are defining
[54:06] Renewables it I don't even think nuclear
[54:09] is defined as renewable so it's solar
[54:11] and a wind or is nuclear now also
[54:13] defined as renewable I don't know
[54:16] exactly but I think it it should be but
[54:19] I don't know if it is yeah so even let's
[54:22] say even if it should be so the m the
[54:26] whole consensus here in Europe is that
[54:28] nuclear is also bad so not let's not go
[54:30] into that but let's go back to um the
[54:33] renewable solar and wind so those uh
[54:36] energy sources have um one issue so they
[54:38] are very cheap but they have one issue
[54:40] and the issue is that um they are not
[54:44] good for base load so they have Peaks
[54:47] and troughs right so now Bitcoin comes
[54:51] in Bitcoin comes in and it's like yeah
[54:53] no worries um I can also make this
[54:55] profitable because I'm interested in
[54:57] stuff that uh just basically cheap
[55:00] electricity so if you have huge Peaks
[55:02] I'm I'm there I I will take it so the we
[55:06] have some synergies that are starting to
[55:09] develop that we don't even know of yet
[55:12] and um this this will come this I think
[55:15] it's very very interesting besides the
[55:18] the monitory part um you even have
[55:20] companies that now are building Bitcoin
[55:22] heaters right so you can go away from
[55:25] the from the gap
[55:27] um generating heat with gas but you can
[55:29] go to electricity with your mining rig
[55:33] so I think we will see so many new
[55:37] things that we cannot even think of yet
[55:40] and I'm ultra bullish um about that as
[55:43] well and very much looking forward that
[55:46] this I think we will see we will see
[55:49] this it's it's something so completely
[55:53] new and I think we saw Texas was a think
[55:56] the the first one that actually tried it
[55:58] with with uh working with the Bitcoin
[56:00] miners to balance the grid if there's
[56:04] like Peaks and stuff like that that you
[56:05] also touched on uh and it it will it
[56:08] will be so fundamentally different a
[56:10] world on bitcoin uh just based on this
[56:15] assumptions uh and also like I had a
[56:18] great podcast with Lisa hu on uh where
[56:20] she's talking about the energy companies
[56:23] could be the next wave of Bitcoin
[56:24] adoption after the ETFs and everything
[56:27] because all the energy companies
[56:29] sometimes even pay for someone else to
[56:32] take their uh excess energy and if they
[56:36] don't have to pay for that but get money
[56:38] because they all of the sudden can mine
[56:40] Bitcoin with that Peak and excess energy
[56:42] uh that completely changes the game and
[56:45] will Skyrocket the the mining hash rate
[56:47] even more even though like if you look
[56:49] at the chart it's like basically a
[56:51] straight line up uh if if you look at
[56:55] the the chart of of the Bitcoin mining
[56:57] has rate uh which is yeah fascinating to
[57:00] see with where where we're going and
[57:02] where we can end up um more broadly uh
[57:06] maybe back to to maybe going to to
[57:09] politics where we did not touch on today
[57:12] too much um do you think that Bitcoin or
[57:15] sound money system in general where the
[57:18] politici politicial force do not have a
[57:21] say in where where are we going with the
[57:24] monetary uh pensions and don't have an
[57:28] infinite money clitch with money
[57:30] printing uh do do you think this changes
[57:34] politics uh in a massive way or will
[57:37] they just be more careful with
[57:39] money yeah also a very good point so I I
[57:43] think I I would site um I would site Lyn
[57:47] Alden uh by saying that political
[57:50] decisions affect things locally and and
[57:55] temporarily
[57:56] while technology or techn technological
[58:00] changes affect things um globally and uh
[58:05] forever and the thing is that um
[58:09] politicians are also just people you
[58:11] know so and they can also be maybe they
[58:15] can also see a a value in in Bitcoin and
[58:19] they can also see that um um our system
[58:23] might need some changes if we want to um
[58:26] continue to to live on on on this planet
[58:29] and maybe the time has has basically
[58:32] come where um we need to also look
[58:36] closer at some fundamental things that
[58:40] we take for granted or basically we take
[58:43] just as as given but but one thing that
[58:46] I also would like to say it's always
[58:50] very very dangerous to think uh you are
[58:53] right in in matters where as established
[58:56] individuals are wrong so that's also um
[59:02] one crucial point that one has to say
[59:06] because um I think um Bitcoin will
[59:10] not there will be some push backs we
[59:14] recently see this also with privacy and
[59:17] and things like that um but did this
[59:20] this is part of the game you know this
[59:21] is part of the game and um I hope that
[59:25] we can manage again to
[59:28] Foster objective conversations about
[59:31] this technology putting away all
[59:34] this huge bag of kind of just things
[59:39] that
[59:40] people think you know just put away the
[59:43] opinions come to a table and openly
[59:48] discuss this technology let's try to
[59:51] Foster this you're doing a great job
[59:53] with your with your podcast so the more
[59:56] we do this and again going back to
[59:58] education right the more we um achieve
[60:01] open and objective education without
[60:04] getting um closed in in our political
[60:07] beliefs and ideologies that is just
[60:11] counterproductive we live in sadly we
[60:14] live in a society that is getting more
[60:16] and more polarized and more and more
[60:20] polarized with political beliefs and
[60:22] people that are against the system and
[60:25] so on and I mean you have to be honest
[60:27] here um bit I think um you have more
[60:31] people getting closer to bitcoin that
[60:36] they have some trust issues with the
[60:38] current system or they they lost trust
[60:41] with the system this is this is a fact
[60:44] but the question is how do you approach
[60:47] people that uh don't have trust issues
[60:50] at all because maybe they are very also
[60:52] privileged right um or they just have
[60:55] had never had the chance to to to think
[60:58] about this or as as we talked very early
[61:01] they never had the chance to think that
[61:03] um this
[61:05] geocentric model uh might not be um the
[61:09] the best model for for Humanity so I'm
[61:12] I'm a human Optimist in a sense that I
[61:17] um hope that we can come together um in
[61:21] on one table and discuss things um
[61:24] openly object objectively and not just
[61:29] throwing around opinions that don't
[61:31] bring us
[61:32] anywhere and this is such a great and
[61:35] beautiful point because this is kind of
[61:36] the point also of my podcast uh just
[61:39] bringing as many different perspectives
[61:41] on bitcoin and I even had uh people on
[61:44] that did not wear completely in Bitcoin
[61:46] they had some other Investments also I
[61:49] usually Ste away from everyone that
[61:51] anyone that has anything in crypto uh
[61:54] besides Bitcoin but if have like stocks
[61:57] in a big way they have gold in a big way
[61:59] next to bitcoin that's totally fine for
[62:01] me at least that's at least they're not
[62:03] involved in a scam or something like
[62:05] that uh so I I try really hard to get
[62:10] all perspectives into the widest range
[62:12] possible on this topic of sound money
[62:15] Bitcoin and freedom in this podcast and
[62:18] I I hope I do a good job uh and uh
[62:21] definitely uh thank you for everyone
[62:23] listening watching all my episodes I'm
[62:25] still amazed when I sometimes see the
[62:26] watch hours that goes in a podcast I
[62:29] recently released an episode that went
[62:32] really good and in the first four hours
[62:35] people watch that podcast uh with 1,000
[62:38] hours like 1,000 hours when in the first
[62:41] four hours of watch time is like crazy
[62:43] for me um but back to the topic um
[62:46] before we end the podcast I always re
[62:48] I'm really curious about what bitcoiners
[62:50] are in general right now doing because I
[62:52] think bitcoiners are really open
[62:55] critical thing thinking uh Curious uh
[62:58] people uh and so besides biology and
[63:01] Bitcoin is there anything that you're
[63:03] currently uh studying or is there
[63:05] anything that you're currently really
[63:07] passionate
[63:08] about okay yeah that's a very
[63:11] interesting question so so two things
[63:13] come come to my mind so one thing is I'm
[63:16] trying to again be more active and uh
[63:18] going to the gym that I previously was
[63:21] uh but then I had like a period of like
[63:24] as you do right with with uh the PHD
[63:27] that um is also a mental mental battle
[63:31] uh but now I'm trying to um go back also
[63:34] working out that's one thing and the
[63:36] second thing it's kind of related to I
[63:39] would still say uh Bitcoin and the topic
[63:42] about money I always try to read on um
[63:45] other views that's the thing that I also
[63:48] said previously uh try to not get
[63:51] captured in in one single bubble try to
[63:54] burst out of the bubble and try to read
[63:56] books also uh what I'm currently reading
[64:00] um are books about MNT you know because
[64:03] I I want to understand the the Viewpoint
[64:06] and the argumentation um that those
[64:08] individuals uh bring to the table um to
[64:12] yeah to understand where they're coming
[64:14] from so this is one main message that I
[64:16] would like also to to to point out try
[64:20] to if you are able to and you speak more
[64:23] than one language try to get information
[64:26] also geographically from another space
[64:28] from another place space Maybe Maybe
[64:30] from Aliens if you're able to but you
[64:32] know what I mean so try to diversify the
[64:35] input that you get and try to always
[64:39] question if uh your argumentations make
[64:43] sense and if another person brings up a
[64:46] new argument where you're like okay very
[64:48] interesting point I did not um take this
[64:52] argument into my calculation why because
[64:56] you can only learn um if you are able to
[64:59] get other World Views in and digest
[65:02] those that's that's
[65:05] key I love that too uh I'm so sorry that
[65:08] I have to like we we we having before we
[65:12] started recording we had this discussion
[65:14] also about my podcast that I have guests
[65:16] all over the world this kind of touches
[65:17] on that point why I'm also having uh
[65:20] English podcast and not German podcast
[65:22] because we both are able to speak German
[65:25] really fun so we could do it in German
[65:28] too but we decided to do in English or I
[65:30] decided to do it in English uh in the
[65:33] whole podcast because when I speak
[65:35] German there's like a small group of
[65:38] people that all are living in similar
[65:42] conditions I would say uh and are not
[65:45] from all over the world in when I do it
[65:47] in English all of the sudden I'm open to
[65:50] I speak with Indian people with African
[65:52] people with American Australian from all
[65:54] over the world with complete completely
[65:55] different point of views and someone
[65:59] from Africa just thinks about Bitcoin
[66:01] differently than someone from Germany uh
[66:03] and that's that's amazing to uh to see
[66:06] and this is just what I wanted to add
[66:08] which is also really amazing I have an
[66:10] endro tetine uh that is the where the
[66:13] previous guest is asking a question for
[66:15] the next guest without knowing who the
[66:16] next guest is and the end routine is
[66:19] just fitting so nicely into our current
[66:22] discussion which I'm which I'm amazed
[66:24] about because usually does not fit in
[66:27] nicely the question from the previous
[66:29] guest to you is what was the last book
[66:32] you read and what is the next book you
[66:34] want to
[66:35] read okay yeah um So currently I'm I'm
[66:40] going into uh books that are written by
[66:43] Warren Mosler I think is his name and
[66:46] also Stephanie Kelton so these are two
[66:49] very big and mmt proponents uh Stephanie
[66:53] Kelton also recently um released a or is
[66:58] releasing a movie called finding uh the
[67:01] money or something like this I watch
[67:03] this in a live live um occasion here in
[67:07] in Switzerland was very interesting and
[67:10] uh a um a clip went viral from this um
[67:13] from this movie uh I think it was some
[67:16] Chief Economist advisor of the current
[67:19] or last um government in in the US of
[67:23] the white house uh BAS basically showing
[67:26] him not being able to answer the
[67:29] question why do the government even
[67:33] borrow if it can create the money okay
[67:36] at this maybe you saw saw the clip it
[67:39] went it went viral this I'm I'm
[67:41] currently um doing uh what next which
[67:45] book next that was the other question
[67:48] right uh yes exactly like what what was
[67:50] the last book you read and what is the
[67:52] the next book you will you want to read
[67:55] um I have so many on on my list but
[68:00] uh I I I cannot tell you one title sadly
[68:04] but I will keep uh bursting into the
[68:07] bubble of also um mmt and other other
[68:11] views to to Ste Ste mate Ste mate still
[68:13] made the arguments and
[68:16] yeah really cool uh it's it's
[68:19] fascinating to to have so many great
[68:21] views uh thank you uh Luca for being on
[68:23] thank you for uh taking your time and
[68:26] and and bringing us the great
[68:29] perspective you you have and the all all
[68:31] insights um before I let you go where
[68:34] can people find you when they have
[68:36] questions for you where where's the
[68:37] place they can find you the best way
[68:40] yeah no first of all I I would like you
[68:43] thank you very much Robin for this uh
[68:46] hopefully engaging discussion also for
[68:48] the for the audience and yeah how can
[68:51] people find me I would say the easiest
[68:53] way is um is on link in so maybe you can
[68:56] also um add this in the description and
[68:59] one other thing for people that um now
[69:02] are new into the space or you know the
[69:04] price is going up uh and uh you want to
[69:08] read something that is really brief and
[69:11] this 19 minutes to get this deeper
[69:13] knowledge about not only price moving up
[69:16] technology I even wrote a very small
