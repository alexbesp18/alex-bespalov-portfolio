[00:00] your grandmother's ETFs that's not
[00:01] Bitcoin Bitcoin is peer-to-peer Bitcoin
[00:04] is communities and we need to go back to
[00:06] its Rebel Roots all I see are financial
[00:09] institutions that are coming in and
[00:11] they're trying to mirror The Current
[00:13] financial system that we have in the
[00:15] world Bitcoin was anti that if we allow
[00:18] these people to come in and kyc everyone
[00:21] and just create a a new banking system
[00:23] on top of what Bitcoin is then we're
[00:25] losing everyone that wants to have
[00:27] privacy has less and less chance I hate
[00:30] being photographed without my permission
[00:32] if I see someone holding the camera I'm
[00:33] the guy that's looking down you have
[00:35] these new laws that are coming in and
[00:37] saying well you have to give this
[00:38] information you have to dox everything
[00:40] about yourself I do think that in 5 or
[00:43] 10 years we're going to wake up and go
[00:45] whole you have a privacy nightmare the
[00:48] only true minority is the individual a
[00:50] lot of homeless people don't have the
[00:52] ability to walk into a bank and start
[00:54] saving money but Bitcoin can give them
[00:57] that
[00:58] ability as Bitcoin BR coming up right
[01:01] there's uh are you there I am I have a
[01:04] keynote um on the main stage so I am
[01:08] preparing for that yeah should be fun
[01:12] but yeah it's gonna be it's yeah the
[01:14] prep preparation is the most trustful
[01:17] part once it like once you're there it's
[01:19] it's fun it's great so I'm looking
[01:22] forward um I mean we can get directly
[01:25] into that like uh do you already have
[01:27] like a direction where you want to go
[01:28] with the the Keynote like an probably
[01:31] like privacy and and and Vel but is is
[01:34] there a specific Direction you want to
[01:36] go with yeah um ex really there is uh
[01:41] which is like Bitcoin the further we get
[01:44] away from the adoption and like from the
[01:46] invention of Bitcoin um the more we lose
[01:50] its Rebel roots and so peer-to-peer is
[01:53] actually at the very heart of what
[01:55] Bitcoin is um and the further you know
[02:00] we get we're losing that and it's
[02:02] communities that are essential to the
[02:04] success of Bitcoin I mean like you can
[02:06] look at your podcast and you can see
[02:08] that you have a community that you're
[02:10] building and you know you are an
[02:13] educator you're an interviewer you're a
[02:15] journalist you're you're a person who is
[02:17] kind of helping to educate masses and
[02:19] create accessible information and you
[02:22] know the internet has been great but
[02:24] it's also so important to look into your
[02:27] local community and start creating these
[02:29] kind of like meetups because we want to
[02:32] encourage adoption and that's from your
[02:35] Merchants that's from the stores well if
[02:37] you don't have sort of a local community
[02:40] that are helping or at least talking
[02:42] about Bitcoin and and you know you know
[02:44] your orange pill crew that are going
[02:46] around and you know maybe you're getting
[02:48] your tires rotated or your tires changed
[02:50] you want to pay your mechanic and
[02:51] Bitcoin well if you don't have a local
[02:54] infrastructure or local Meetup or
[02:56] Community then some of that information
[02:58] that you want to kind of give to these
[03:00] people can get lost really easily so my
[03:03] kind of approach and my my talk to it is
[03:06] that not your grandmother's ETFs that's
[03:09] not Bitcoin um Bitcoin is peer-to-peer
[03:11] Bitcoin is communities and we need to go
[03:14] back to its Rebel roots and understand
[03:16] that that's what makes that's why we're
[03:19] all here you know Bitcoin was a answer
[03:22] to that so is it dangerous uh that we
[03:27] have those kind of central I mean there
[03:29] like when you look at Holdings most
[03:32] people hold it on coinbase then the
[03:35] Bitcoin ETFs make like additional Park
[03:38] on that because most have it on coinbase
[03:41] bitcoin ETFs in general is like a
[03:43] centralization of Holdings uh then we
[03:46] have big exchanges where most people buy
[03:48] they are usually kyc they usually have
[03:50] like data leaks and stuff like that uh
[03:53] is is like obviously Bitcoin is really
[03:56] decentralized but all the stuff on top
[03:58] of Bitcoin as the Bitcoin edfs the
[04:01] exchanges kyc all this stuff is that can
[04:04] this this be a threat to bitcoin or is
[04:07] it just a threat to the
[04:11] individual you know I look at it as a
[04:13] threat to the individual because how I
[04:15] use Bitcoin is you know is right now um
[04:19] it's very easy to get distracted by all
[04:22] of these centralized figures and
[04:25] agencies and and and companies that are
[04:27] creating these Solutions um but what I
[04:30] kind of see and how I use Bitcoin is
[04:32] very very different than how some other
[04:34] people you know use Bitcoin is you know
[04:37] you have like even this week I you know
[04:38] on Twitter you see like this guy saying
[04:40] oh like Bitcoin is still a speculative
[04:43] asset you know it's like you're
[04:44] speculating on it because you're
[04:45] investing and it's like but am I
[04:48] investing if I actually use Bitcoin on a
[04:51] daily basis or if I get paid in Bitcoin
[04:54] um so for me it's not an investment it's
[04:57] a means of you know trans actions and
[05:00] it's a means to you know as someone who
[05:02] travels a lot um you know I I move from
[05:06] you know this year I've been in Poland
[05:08] and madira I live in Czech Republic I go
[05:10] to England you know and these countries
[05:13] still have different currencies you know
[05:15] Poland is you know not as on a currency
[05:17] Czech Republic's on a different one then
[05:19] you have the Euro um so for me Bitcoin
[05:22] is a means of transaction and I enjoy
[05:26] spending my Bitcoin so when I look at
[05:28] these centralized kind of companies like
[05:31] coinbase that you know coinbase has been
[05:33] around for a long time um you know I I
[05:36] can't say they didn't provide a service
[05:38] they didn't do you know something good
[05:41] for Bitcoin because that what they did
[05:43] is they enabled Bitcoin for a lot of
[05:46] people um but you know now we look at it
[05:51] and we say well these kyc practices and
[05:54] this kind of stuff have come into play
[05:56] and it's become kind of dangerous for
[05:58] the individual because my my personal
[06:00] information is being passed around
[06:02] through all of these different agencies
[06:05] and and and companies and that's a risk
[06:08] to me because my personal data is
[06:10] important and the more you start to
[06:12] learn about Bitcoin and the more you
[06:13] start to learn about the way the
[06:15] direction and the world is heading the
[06:17] more you start to go maybe I should be
[06:20] more careful with my data and my
[06:24] privacy
[06:26] sorry yeah I just want to get into
[06:29] because we talked about it before
[06:31] and I myself can conclude to that
[06:34] because I got way more careful with
[06:37] privacy I have a little bit of a problem
[06:39] because I'm really outspoken about
[06:41] Bitcoin and my face and my clear name is
[06:43] there and stuff like that and kind of my
[06:46] goal is to be as well known as possible
[06:49] I mean my real goal is like to educate
[06:51] people on on on bitcoin have great
[06:53] conversation with bitcoiners but this
[06:55] has an implication because I try to get
[06:57] better every day this makes more well
[07:00] known also this makes also me as a
[07:03] bigger Target for people that uh want to
[07:06] yeah get to my Bitcoin basically um but
[07:09] in general I feel like everyone that
[07:12] wants to have privacy has less and less
[07:15] chance to and there there are so many
[07:18] Avenues we can go through there's like
[07:19] this this kvc the state wants to know
[07:22] everything about you then there's also
[07:24] like we have now phones everywhere like
[07:27] there's always cameras uh you are
[07:29] probably in like 20 different camera
[07:32] roles from people where they just click
[07:34] pictures of something and you were just
[07:36] passing by uh and then they like in in
[07:39] the Apple iCloud then there's AI that
[07:41] can collect all those St and connected
[07:43] like there are so many different things
[07:44] in that are we like on the one side uh
[07:49] in a war against privacy kind of or is
[07:52] that like just also a trend and continue
[07:55] like what what do you see with that is
[07:57] is privacy really fying you mentioned
[08:00] something that like has been in my head
[08:01] for years which is like can you imagine
[08:03] all of the crazy photos that are taking
[08:05] of taken of you like you're just walking
[08:07] to the city and there's a bunch of
[08:09] tourists taking photo like I live in one
[08:11] of the most touristy cities in Europe
[08:13] and like I you know every time I go to
[08:16] the city center I'm on how how many
[08:18] peoples but as I've kind of you know
[08:22] started to deal with living in this
[08:24] world where there's a camera in
[08:25] someone's hand constantly you know I I
[08:29] hate being photographed without my
[08:31] permission um you know I'm the guy that
[08:33] if you if I see someone holding the
[08:35] camera I'm the guy that's looking down
[08:36] you know I usually wear a hat and I do
[08:38] look down and it's not because I don't
[08:40] because I don't want some crazy awkward
[08:42] photo of me lining up in the iCloud
[08:45] where they've mapped all of my facial
[08:47] expressions and emotions and now you see
[08:50] how AI can take just a few pictures of
[08:52] someone or you know they can take this
[08:54] podcast with you and me and they can
[08:57] recreate a deep fake and do all these
[08:59] kinds of things so yeah I do think there
[09:01] is a war you know for privacy currently
[09:04] going on um but it's a you know
[09:07] everything is done in the name of
[09:08] convenience or security and that's what
[09:11] what what bothers me is I don't feel
[09:13] that I live in a more secure world
[09:15] because I've given up my priv my right
[09:18] to privacy in a lot of ways you know and
[09:21] I go back to you know growing up in the
[09:24] south of America um you know I'm from
[09:27] Mississippi originally and Mississippi
[09:30] was a place where privacy was important
[09:34] um but you know you you would go to
[09:35] church on Sunday and that's where you
[09:37] would get all the gossip right is people
[09:40] so humans are naturally inclined to want
[09:44] to invade other people's privacy right
[09:47] it's like um I you know I have a kind of
[09:50] a a thing as you might be able to see it
[09:52] over here on my window still but I have
[09:54] this briefcase and um I walk around with
[09:57] this briefcase and whenever at a
[10:00] conference or some sort of event and the
[10:02] first day nobody says anything to me but
[10:04] then the second day people start going
[10:06] hey man what's in the box and that you
[10:10] know it naturally triggers something is
[10:13] the unknown or or the Curiosity in
[10:15] people they want to know things about
[10:16] other people and so I look at like how
[10:19] the internet has enabled us to kind of
[10:22] share everything we have about ourselves
[10:25] and they encourage you to share you know
[10:27] you remember the early days of Facebook
[10:28] where people like look I'm having this
[10:30] for lunch or I'm doing this right now
[10:32] and then you know you move into
[10:33] Instagram stories where you tell the
[10:35] story of your life and I believe that
[10:38] that's absolutely fine I believe that
[10:41] privacy is the right to selectively
[10:43] reveal yourself so if you want to share
[10:46] that kind of information absolutely more
[10:48] than happy to you know you look at Tik
[10:51] Tock and all of these things well yeah
[10:53] this is creating a atmosphere where they
[10:56] encourage you to share as much as
[10:58] possible
[10:59] and that's something that you know is
[11:03] alarming because you're being
[11:06] desensitized to a lot of things of you
[11:09] know is my mom is a really good example
[11:12] is I would always ask her she go oh I
[11:14] don't care I have nothing to hide you
[11:16] know I have nothing to hide and I'm like
[11:19] yeah well okay let me see your phone you
[11:22] know like give me your phone your
[11:24] unlocked phone and how many people would
[11:26] be willing to pass you their unlocked
[11:28] phone
[11:29] and that's something that concerns me is
[11:32] because with my personal data and with
[11:35] the data that is used for kyc um that is
[11:38] a lot of information about a person that
[11:40] can be used in lots of Nefarious ways
[11:44] and so you know I don't want to give
[11:46] that information up to someone just
[11:49] because it's makes it more convenient
[11:51] for me to do something if I'm going to
[11:53] give that information to someone I want
[11:55] to make sure that it's being protected
[11:56] in the correct right way and I shouldn't
[12:01] need permission to participate in
[12:03] something like Bitcoin or these things
[12:06] is without that freedom to transact I
[12:09] don't believe you have any other right
[12:11] so we live in a world where you have to
[12:13] get permission to do everything it seems
[12:16] and that's a lack of freedom and I think
[12:20] that that's where the war on privacy
[12:23] becomes kind of clear to me is that you
[12:25] know when you have um documents being it
[12:29] says you shouldn't use services that
[12:31] don't do
[12:33] kyc um but how can I trust any service
[12:38] like what what where do I put my trust
[12:42] and that's that's the thing that's so
[12:44] hard um to determine is who to really
[12:48] trust I also feel like that KSC is not
[12:53] only being like completely normalized
[12:55] but also like really pushed for like uh
[12:58] I feel like in especially in the
[12:59] European Union we have a really a push
[13:01] for like oh KC know your customers no
[13:04] like collect data regardless I mean
[13:07] there's all like the the the privacy
[13:09] laws and stuff like that but uh we seen
[13:12] as this has been inter implemented and
[13:14] when it comes to to financial stuff and
[13:17] banking all of oh we have to know
[13:19] everything because then they can do
[13:21] illegal stuff with that but no the
[13:24] that's it's it's also privacy like you
[13:27] you should not uh know everything about
[13:29] a person do you do you fear that like
[13:33] kyc not non kyc on peer to-peer is
[13:36] something just illegal in like 5 10 20
[13:41] years or or not illegal but something
[13:42] that is being
[13:44] outlawed yeah well I mean yeah it's very
[13:48] interesting because you know I also like
[13:51] I said previously I grew up in the South
[13:52] and in America you know if you get
[13:54] pulled over for there's very little
[13:57] privacy in America if you get stopped by
[14:00] the police and you get charged with
[14:02] something and you are Innocent but you
[14:05] were charged for it um your name your
[14:08] photograph your date of birth your
[14:10] address appears in the public in the
[14:12] newspaper right so even if you have not
[14:15] been convicted if you've just been
[14:17] arrested for something even if you're
[14:18] wrongly con you know accused of
[14:21] something um and that information is
[14:23] there pretty much forever um because of
[14:26] the way the internet works but you know
[14:28] you look at Europe and you have like
[14:30] gdpr and then you know we go like okay
[14:34] well what does that mean and you have
[14:35] such strict privacy laws when it comes
[14:38] like if I even take a photo of a car on
[14:40] the street if I don't blur the license
[14:42] plate then I there is some sort of
[14:44] burden on me you know that you have to
[14:46] be careful with these kinds of things so
[14:49] you have these things that are
[14:50] protecting your privacy but then you
[14:52] have these new laws that are coming in
[14:54] and saying well you have to give this
[14:56] information you have to dox everything
[14:58] about your yourself so your question is
[15:00] very interesting because I do think that
[15:03] in five or 10 years we're going to wake
[15:05] up and go holy [ __ ] we have a privacy
[15:08] nightmare because everyone's personal
[15:11] data has been leaked and is out there
[15:13] you know look at what happened in El
[15:15] Salvador with Gio wallet is you onboard
[15:17] the population of the country and then
[15:20] all of the country's information winds
[15:22] up on the dark Whip and that to me is
[15:26] yeah I do think that eventually we will
[15:29] have a serious wakeup call and go wow
[15:32] this was a mistake and um we should not
[15:36] have these sort of loss and you know we
[15:39] are we live in a different world than a
[15:42] lot of people do we live in a in a West
[15:45] the Western world that has laws and has
[15:48] these things in place and has Banks and
[15:51] and these institutions but a lot of the
[15:53] world you have so many people in the
[15:55] world who do not have identification who
[15:57] don't have bank accounts who who don't
[15:59] have the ability to participate in a
[16:01] normal system and you have refugees um
[16:04] you know Asylum Seekers who have left
[16:06] their country due to war or anything and
[16:08] they've left everything behind and
[16:10] they're coming somewhere new and they're
[16:12] going well you don't have the
[16:14] requirements so sorry you can't
[16:16] participate in this system and you know
[16:19] we've seen that we see that happening on
[16:21] a on a daily basis and then um you know
[16:24] so I I think that your question is is a
[16:27] very interesting one because
[16:29] I I really do think that maybe we're
[16:32] going to wind up seeing kyc as a stretch
[16:34] too far is giving your information to
[16:36] companies who should never have had
[16:39] it you mentioned that you have no
[16:42] privacy in America is that the reason
[16:44] why you're now in in Europe and not no
[16:46] longer in in America no um I was just
[16:51] from a very young age fascinated with
[16:53] with history and Europe and and things
[16:56] and um you know growing up in
[16:58] Mississippi Missippi it's hard to get
[17:01] out of Mississippi um you know most
[17:04] people I know are married at 19 and have
[17:07] kids and then they're divorced by 24 and
[17:10] then they work at the you know the
[17:12] manufacturing jobs and it's really hard
[17:15] to get out of there and you know
[17:17] Mississippi is a tough place it's still
[17:20] the most illiterate most obese you know
[17:23] the health care the education system is
[17:25] still really poor um but I was very very
[17:28] fortunate for a young age um to have
[17:30] that Curiosity to seek other things and
[17:34] uh I went to like boarding school um and
[17:37] I met people from all over the world and
[17:41] that was the first time that I was
[17:42] outside of my bubble I still have my
[17:46] Southern accent you know it's still
[17:47] there but from a very young age I
[17:50] started meeting people and I realized
[17:51] that the world is a lot bigger than
[17:53] Mississippi and um I went to school in
[17:57] Texas University in Texas and um I did
[18:01] like a study abroad program and I went
[18:03] over to England and I had some just
[18:05] amazing professors that just told me hey
[18:10] it's possible if you want to live over
[18:12] here and explore it's possible like
[18:15] don't limit yourself so um when I
[18:18] graduated from University you know I had
[18:20] a teaching degree in history and I said
[18:22] you know what instead of teaching high
[18:25] school for a year or like instead of
[18:26] starting and teaching people who hate
[18:29] hate you just because you're a teacher
[18:31] um my kids I I'm going to go do a year
[18:33] in in Czech Republic because I came here
[18:36] for like a four day weekend and I had an
[18:38] awesome time met met friends and kept in
[18:41] touch I was like yeah I'll do one year
[18:42] I'll do one year in Czech Republic so I
[18:44] came over here and started teaching
[18:45] English and then I look up and now I've
[18:48] been here 13 years my life is here my
[18:51] dog I have you know I've settled here I
[18:54] love it my check friends my my life here
[18:57] is better than it's I could imagine it
[18:59] being anywhere else and so when I look
[19:01] at the United States you know I I said
[19:04] this before but like United States used
[19:06] to be and it still is for a lot of
[19:08] people this Beacon of freedom and and
[19:10] hope and that anything is
[19:13] possible um but when you really kind of
[19:15] studying what's knowing what's going on
[19:17] in the world you look at it and you go
[19:19] it's also a failed State it's you know
[19:23] it's in Decline and you it's really hard
[19:27] I'd say to to be
[19:29] um to make it there you know
[19:31] homelessness in America is is probably
[19:34] worse there than anywhere else that I've
[19:36] seen um the country is is very different
[19:39] I look at my hometown in Mississippi
[19:42] where you know we didn't have
[19:43] homelessness growing up we didn't have
[19:45] this and now every stop sign and traffic
[19:48] light has a homeless person at it under
[19:51] every bridge there's there's people
[19:52] sleeping and for me that's just
[19:56] something is fundamentally wrong and you
[19:59] look at the situation with people's
[20:01] finances and inflation and how do you
[20:04] escape that and I that's where why I
[20:06] think Bitcoin is so interesting is
[20:07] because it enables anyone to start to
[20:13] save you know a lot of homeless people
[20:16] don't have the ability to walk into a
[20:18] bank and start saving money but Bitcoin
[20:21] can give them that ability today and I I
[20:25] think that when you start requiring you
[20:28] know going back and touching on it is
[20:31] that's where I I still think the risk is
[20:33] so why do I live over here I don't know
[20:36] I just like it I I like living here but
[20:39] also there's nothing like a
[20:42] postcommunist country that understands
[20:45] what it means to have freedom and the
[20:49] further you get away from
[20:51] obtaining your
[20:53] freedom the more likely you are to start
[20:56] giving it away again
[20:59] and becoming less free so I I like the
[21:03] Czech Republic because there is a sense
[21:05] of that Rebel here that you know we have
[21:09] to protect that
[21:11] freedom yeah I I'm often there because
[21:14] I'm really close to the Border as we
[21:15] discussed before uh and I always love
[21:18] the country I mean uh it's the the food
[21:21] is way cheaper there living is way
[21:24] cheaper than in Austria and it's just a
[21:26] half half an hour right so I I love it
[21:29] also because of there sometimes like
[21:31] make like a two-day trip there and it's
[21:33] almost like saving money if you live
[21:35] there even with the the the
[21:37] transportation cost and stuff like that
[21:39] um which is also interesting we talked
[21:42] about that before a little bit before we
[21:44] recorded uh because you're from America
[21:47] and over 50% of my viewership is in
[21:50] America but your company vaxel like the
[21:53] company you're working for vaxel is not
[21:56] in
[21:56] America yeah let's get into that why
[21:59] like and also as an additional
[22:03] information I had Beach Bitcoin on from
[22:06] Swiss uh and they are also saying yeah
[22:08] we in all uh we're basically everywhere
[22:11] but we're not marketing everywhere and
[22:12] we're definitely not in America like she
[22:15] also had had this clear like we're not
[22:16] in
[22:17] America yeah I mean look I I would love
[22:20] to be right I would love to to to to say
[22:23] that we are available everywhere in the
[22:25] world um but the way that things are
[22:28] right now is we really want to build a
[22:30] tool and we want to make something that
[22:33] yeah anyone and everyone can use um but
[22:36] we don't want to lose that ability to
[22:40] create something that can truly Empower
[22:42] individuals um by going in America and
[22:46] and you know it's just something that
[22:48] right now it doesn't seem like the
[22:50] freest place to do business or to do
[22:52] anything and you know when I say
[22:54] business like vexel is is a nonprofit We
[22:58] do not monetize we will never monetize
[23:02] this is a free and open source tool so
[23:05] when I look at it is yeah our our we're
[23:07] on GitHub go anyone can go and and look
[23:10] at it and take it and Fork it do
[23:12] whatever they want with it but yeah you
[23:14] know I kind of joke that there's there's
[23:16] a few countries where we're not truly
[23:18] available and that's like North Korea
[23:21] China uh United States and like Iran and
[23:24] I go like yeah there's some sort of
[23:25] weird new axis of Bitcoin evil um and
[23:29] you know it's like I don't think that
[23:31] you know truly deep down it's like I
[23:33] don't know if there if we would have
[23:34] some sort of problem if we went and we
[23:37] lost in America I don't I don't know um
[23:40] but the fact is is that I because we
[23:43] don't know and because of it is is it's
[23:46] just a place that we're not ready to go
[23:48] to yet but that's not saying that we
[23:49] ultimately won't one day um but the
[23:52] United States is certainly
[23:55] um strange in their wording and their
[23:59] language and how they are attacking
[24:02] people these days for it and you know
[24:04] that's where where vexel comes in is is
[24:06] is vexel is simply just a tool that
[24:09] connects people it's a it's a mobile app
[24:12] that connects you with people that you
[24:14] can trust based on that reputation that
[24:19] real world reputation so you know we're
[24:22] not a we're not a Bitcoin exchange we're
[24:25] we're not a wallet we are not a Fiat onr
[24:28] we never touch anything all we do is
[24:31] connect you with people that you already
[24:33] possibly know in a privacy preserving
[24:36] way so looking at you know what it is is
[24:40] right now I'm not saying that we won't
[24:41] ever be there I really do hope that we
[24:44] can be and I hope that we can be
[24:45] everywhere yeah yeah amazing uh I mean
[24:50] not not amazing that there it's not in
[24:52] America but uh amazing that that that
[24:55] things like vexel even exist
[24:57] [Music]
[24:59] I mean that's that's what's really you
[25:02] know it's I am super passionate about
[25:06] what what we're doing um you know I've
[25:08] been in Bitcoin a very long time um but
[25:12] vexel is the first thing that's really
[25:14] like you know lit that fire and that
[25:17] passion in me because um I get to work
[25:19] on something that makes tries at least
[25:22] to make Bitcoin as it was intended to be
[25:25] which is that peer-to-peer and without
[25:27] trust ing any sort of third party um and
[25:31] that's like what yeah that's why I get
[25:33] out of bed every day
[25:35] um love it it's also interesting for me
[25:39] that it's a
[25:40] nonprofit um is is nonprofit meaning
[25:43] that you don't have any Revenue Source
[25:46] other than outside investors outside
[25:48] like Satoshi Labs probably uh or is
[25:51] there some fee to it but you don't break
[25:54] in a profit or like how is how is that
[25:56] going vexel is
[25:59] 100% free always will be um we are
[26:04] supported purely based on donations and
[26:07] grants we've received a grant from opats
[26:10] um which we are very thankful for that
[26:12] keeps us kind of going um our initial
[26:15] funding yes did come from Satoshi Labs
[26:18] um but now we are you know we're
[26:20] actively seeking fund fundraising um we
[26:24] work on our geyser. fund page to se some
[26:26] crowd you know crowdfunding as well but
[26:29] vexel truly works on value for Value um
[26:32] you know if you have a successful trade
[26:34] on vexel and you want to donate and kick
[26:36] back and say thanks we love it we're
[26:39] very appreciative but we're never ever
[26:41] going to put up a pay wall or an
[26:43] obstacle to enable you to use vexel ever
[26:47] um there you know like I said we don't
[26:50] have any ability to do that because we
[26:53] don't facilitate any sort of Bitcoin
[26:56] transactions whatsoever so there's
[26:58] nowhere for us to monetize we don't want
[27:02] that we just want to connect you with
[27:04] the counterparty that you can trust and
[27:07] do a trade with and whatever you do with
[27:09] them that's entirely up to you like we
[27:11] have zero knowledge of any of
[27:14] your trades or offers or conversations
[27:17] or we don't know anything um because
[27:20] it's it's truly private and um like
[27:24] looking at you know monetization yeah
[27:26] it's not easy and it's not you know I
[27:30] don't work for free kind of thing you
[27:32] know it's like I I have a apartment rent
[27:35] I have to pay for I have a dog on my
[27:37] sofa over here that I have to feed you
[27:38] know um so donations are are what keeps
[27:41] us keeps us going um and helps us you
[27:45] know to to pay our developers a living
[27:48] wage and to to do these things so yeah I
[27:50] mean that's what say if you use vexel um
[27:54] and you love it and it's it's working
[27:56] for you and and you know you want say
[27:58] thank you everything helps everything
[28:01] helps yeah uh yeah it's it's it's
[28:05] important to support uh the things that
[28:08] you like and I feel like um Bitcoin is a
[28:12] quite generous uh I at least uh from my
[28:15] experience I sometimes get like Sates or
[28:19] even like super FS on YouTube and stuff
[28:21] like that I'm like there's someone that
[28:24] listens to something that's completely
[28:25] free he has no um obligation to to give
[28:30] me any money I even have sponsors where
[28:33] they are helping me to have the show uh
[28:36] so I can do full-time this but because
[28:39] with with no sponsors I could not do it
[28:41] full-time because I also have to pay
[28:43] rent and stuff uh but even though I have
[28:46] sponsors even though I make money with
[28:48] it they're like it's so valuable I like
[28:51] it and I support that on top of that and
[28:54] with Axel is really interesting because
[28:55] uh I don't know how many people how many
[28:58] people are are working actively on on
[29:00] vexel I mean it's open source everybody
[29:02] could work on it but how many are
[29:04] actually in the team we are five people
[29:07] and the dog I joke the dog but no he is
[29:10] absolutely part of our our you know
[29:13] daily life um because when I'm in the
[29:16] office he's that he's that guy there but
[29:17] no we are five five people um and we
[29:20] have you know some amazing developers uh
[29:24] we have stepan who was on here there's
[29:25] me and there's Leia our CEO and um you
[29:30] know she's a strong powerful woman in
[29:32] Bitcoin she has a voice and which is
[29:35] something that you you know you don't
[29:36] see and you know her her history and her
[29:39] track record has brought her to to to
[29:40] vexel and you know I'm I'm so happy to
[29:43] have her as the lead because she's a
[29:44] true Cipher Punk um and someone who
[29:47] understands the the values of of what
[29:50] what vexel is and and why this is being
[29:52] why this is necessary but um we are a
[29:55] very small team um yes if you you know
[29:58] if you have some feedback if you have if
[30:00] you know if you want to work on vexel or
[30:02] if you see something like open an issue
[30:04] um we are open source you can find us on
[30:06] GitHub um so yeah I mean please if you
[30:09] have something or you know especially
[30:11] languages as well if you want to
[30:12] localize vexel into your local community
[30:16] or your language um we have crow in you
[30:20] know you can you can reach out to us get
[30:22] on crowd in and start translating the
[30:23] app so even obscure languages can can to
[30:28] vexel so make vexel it's a tool for you
[30:31] it's not a tool for for you know for
[30:33] anyone other than you um it's a tool for
[30:36] me I that you know that's what
[30:37] ultimately where it came from is we
[30:39] wanted something that we would want to
[30:42] use and so we sit down and you look at
[30:45] it as okay well what kind of solutions
[30:47] are there what peer-to-peer Solutions
[30:49] currently exist and what are the
[30:51] problems with them um and you know if
[30:54] you look at um you know online peer peer
[30:58] platforms you know they're they're great
[31:00] they're okay but they do pose some risk
[31:04] to the individual which is well trust um
[31:08] you know they're they're kyc light um
[31:11] because you know if I do a trade with
[31:13] somebody and my I have to send you money
[31:15] via of Bank my name appears in your bank
[31:19] account or if I need to sell Bitcoin and
[31:21] then I have you know multiple
[31:23] transactions coming into my bank account
[31:24] from different people um my Banks might
[31:27] start to ask ask questions about those
[31:29] transactions and I have to explain
[31:31] things and um you know that's I'm not
[31:34] saying you shouldn't explain things I'm
[31:36] saying that you can start to pose a risk
[31:39] to the individual by using these
[31:40] platforms because you might trade with
[31:42] somebody who has a great five-star
[31:45] reputation today uh but they might
[31:47] commit a crime tomorrow and then next
[31:49] thing you know you're associated with
[31:50] that individual so there's a risk and
[31:53] that's why you shouldn't really trade
[31:55] with people you don't know or at least
[31:58] have some sort of level of trust with um
[32:01] you know face-to-face trades are still
[32:05] the best way to do peer-to-peer
[32:07] because um it's cash cash is still king
[32:11] of privacy um there's no digital trace
[32:14] and it's also just kind of fun um I you
[32:18] know every peer-to-peer trade that I've
[32:20] ever been on I've I've enjoyed it I've
[32:23] never had a bad experience um it's the
[32:26] first one you do is is like this you
[32:28] know you sometimes you have to overcome
[32:30] that feeling um but you do it and you go
[32:33] that was cool I met somebody who's
[32:35] like-minded and that's what you really
[32:38] find with with vexel is you're meeting
[32:41] people who are in your social graph that
[32:45] have similar interest to you that want
[32:47] to trade and want to do it quickly and
[32:49] privately um and looking at like you
[32:52] know other platforms is I just still
[32:54] think there's too much risk um they use
[32:57] services like escrow escros are a
[32:59] trusted third party that's not what
[33:02] Bitcoin was supposed to be um but I mean
[33:04] I'm not not going to understand why
[33:06] these platforms exist and they they work
[33:08] and they're they're beneficial for a lot
[33:09] of people um but when it comes to you
[33:13] know scalability in the long term we
[33:16] have to look at solutions that scale and
[33:18] that's where vexel came in is it's open
[33:21] source it's free it's scalable um it's
[33:26] private and and you know every single
[33:30] day my network gets bigger and it
[33:33] becomes easier and easier to find
[33:36] Bitcoin or anything like eggs from
[33:40] Farmers honey from Farmers these people
[33:42] are selling eggs and honey on on vexel
[33:44] for Bitcoin and the guy that I buy my
[33:47] eggs from now um like he comes to my
[33:52] neighborhood like every single weekend
[33:55] and for farmers market and so I just buy
[33:57] eggs from him with Bitcoin um and then
[34:00] we met on vexel and so we were we had
[34:03] like four common connections four people
[34:06] that I knew and I didn't know the farmer
[34:09] next thing you know I have an egg guy
[34:11] and we have a I have a friend I enjoy
[34:12] seeing him every week and we get to chat
[34:14] about Bitcoin a little bit chat about
[34:16] what's new get eggs and it's a positive
[34:19] interaction um and it's personal when
[34:21] you're we're on the internet you lose
[34:23] that that sense of community and like
[34:25] you know Community is absolutely
[34:26] everything it's what functions if you
[34:29] visit me in
[34:30] Prague you're going to ask me what do
[34:33] you recommend right where should I where
[34:35] should I eat what should I do because
[34:38] I'm someone that you trust and you value
[34:40] my opinions and I'm not going to send
[34:42] you to a shitty restaurant I'm not going
[34:46] to go I'm I want you to have a good
[34:48] experience and that's where we look at
[34:52] where again while vexel is like yeah
[34:55] when you base something on reputation
[34:58] um you protect it because my real world
[35:00] reputation is what really matters to me
[35:03] um and I have a you know if like I said
[35:06] if you come to Prague I'm going to give
[35:07] you good things not not bad ones so
[35:11] reputation is important that's what
[35:13] makes speex will work if you are
[35:15] listening to this podcast you might be
[35:17] wondering what is actually the setup
[35:19] look like of Robin or how can I improve
[35:21] my Bitcoin setup and there's two things
[35:24] you have to buy Bitcoin from the right
[35:25] source and you have to store Bitcoin the
[35:28] right way let's focus on the first thing
[35:30] how to buy Bitcoin it's simple have a
[35:32] Bitcoin only exchange don't deal with
[35:35] the shitcoin exchanges don't deal with
[35:36] an exchange that has an own token or
[35:39] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[35:41] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[35:44] for me the best partner for that and now
[35:48] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[35:49] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[35:52] a self custody solution where you
[35:55] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[35:58] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[36:01] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[36:04] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[36:06] phas and you are better than 95% of all
[36:10] Bitcoin hodlers if you have more than
[36:12] ,000 in Bitcoin it's an absolutely must
[36:16] have one last thing before we get back
[36:17] to the video I'm really passionate about
[36:19] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[36:22] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[36:25] in June the Bitcoin br conf confence
[36:28] it's the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[36:31] conference in whole of Europe for all
[36:33] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[36:36] this place in June for all europees it's
[36:38] a must go anyways you're so close to the
[36:41] Bitcoin PR conference you basically have
[36:43] to come I will do interviews there and I
[36:46] would love to meet you all there use
[36:48] code Robin for all my sponsors to get
[36:51] discounts and use the links down in the
[36:53] description amazing and this is this is
[36:56] something an extremely important Point
[36:58] uh which leads me to a question that I
[37:00] probably should have asked earlier in
[37:02] the podcast um what exactly is vaxel and
[37:05] how does it work uh for for the people
[37:08] that don't know about it for people that
[37:10] only uh induct till now with like usual
[37:13] KC exchanges uh and stuff like that and
[37:17] yeah you can even buy like you can not
[37:19] only buy Bitcoin but you can also like
[37:21] buy X on there like what is Vex and how
[37:24] does it work so the simple answer is Vex
[37:27] is a mobile app that enables you to
[37:31] connect with people in your social graph
[37:35] your web of trust and that web of trusts
[37:39] is something that you have spent your
[37:41] whole
[37:42] life getting and gaining right the
[37:46] people that you trust so my family my
[37:51] friends my colleagues what vexel does is
[37:54] it enables you to uh connect with these
[37:58] people and do trades with them there is
[38:02] a Marketplace that Marketplace is fully
[38:05] anonymous because your offers are
[38:08] encrypted for each person individually
[38:11] so when I go to the marketplace I open
[38:13] up vexel and I see here is the offers
[38:15] for people who are selling Bitcoin
[38:17] here's the people who are buy who are
[38:19] looking to buy Bitcoin these are the
[38:22] people who are selling eggs and honey
[38:24] and products like computers and there
[38:27] was someone selling a horse on vexel
[38:29] which is like was so cool um and what
[38:33] you do is you see oh this offer you
[38:36] share 14 mutual friends or Mutual
[38:41] connections this offer you have five
[38:43] Mutual connections but this offer you
[38:45] have 55 Mutual connections that doesn't
[38:50] mean that there are 55 people that you
[38:54] know that are on vexel that means that
[38:56] you and this person person share 55 of
[38:59] the same connections so right my friend
[39:03] Bob Bob does not use vexel but I grew up
[39:07] with Bob Bob is in my web of trust I
[39:11] know Bob for years I trust Bob Bob
[39:14] trusts me but it seems that I can see
[39:18] that whoever posted this offer also
[39:21] knows Bob so you I don't know who you
[39:24] are you don't know who I am but you and
[39:27] I both know that we know
[39:31] Bob right so what I can do is even if
[39:35] Bob is our only common connection if we
[39:39] have one what I can do is I can say to
[39:42] you my counterparty in vexel hey we both
[39:47] know
[39:49] Bob so I'm fine I know Bob really well
[39:52] I'm fine with meeting you face to face
[39:55] if Bob says that it's okay so what I'm
[39:59] going to do if you're okay with it is I
[40:02] will send Bob a message and you send Bob
[40:06] a
[40:07] message if Bob says yes Robin is a good
[40:13] guy or whoever you are is a good guy
[40:16] then I trust
[40:18] Bob so that's the difference in our
[40:23] reputation model that's the difference
[40:25] in everything is I don't e grow because
[40:28] I've got Bob and if you screw me over
[40:31] because I grew up with Bob and you know
[40:33] Bob for also 10 years if you screw me
[40:36] over Bob is going to be very mad at you
[40:39] and it's going to damage your real world
[40:41] reputation and again that's the thing
[40:43] that we protect more than anything my
[40:46] online reputation if I destroy it today
[40:49] fine I'll create a new one tomorrow
[40:51] right but I cannot reinvent my real
[40:54] world reputation without me getting up
[40:56] and moving to the other side of the
[40:57] world and changing my name right and I
[41:02] think that that's that's really what
[41:03] vexel is in practice is it's a mobile
[41:06] app that allows you to see offers from
[41:10] people that you already have connections
[41:13] with so it stops at friends of friends
[41:17] so if you and I know each other I can
[41:20] trade with you but I can then also trade
[41:23] with all of your
[41:25] friends that's where it stops doesn't go
[41:27] any further than that so you only see
[41:29] your network my network is different
[41:32] from yours your network is different
[41:34] from Bob's uh but it's possible that I'm
[41:37] in your network and you're in Bob's but
[41:40] it's not the whole one right so if you
[41:43] and I trade contacts it's going to open
[41:45] up your network to mine but you and I we
[41:48] don't know each other so well so you're
[41:50] it's not someone that I can say oh yeah
[41:52] I mean I I went on his podcast but I I
[41:55] didn't grow up with him so I still don't
[41:58] know if he's the best person to trade
[42:00] with right so at your own risk but if I
[42:03] have 15 friends in common 20 friends in
[42:06] common 30 friends in common it's very
[42:10] very likely that whoever this person
[42:13] that I'm going to meet is is going to be
[42:15] a
[42:16] valuable experience and a valuable
[42:18] contact for me and that we can trade
[42:22] yeah
[42:23] privately I love that concept because
[42:26] it's it's it's like the real world um
[42:30] just making it an open source
[42:32] marketplace where it's easier to
[42:35] exchange things and easier to to see
[42:37] things yeah because in the real world we
[42:40] also have this like like be like okay is
[42:43] is there someone that knows me and is
[42:45] there someone that I can buy my ex from
[42:47] is like I live in a small town in in in
[42:50] Austria where there are like free
[42:53] farmers in like 10 15 minutes range of
[42:56] of car drive
[42:57] where I can buy eggs yogurt meat
[43:01] everything from them like actually from
[43:04] directly from that farm and it's I I
[43:07] love it that it is there uh and this is
[43:11] like oh I was there and and I I like it
[43:14] way more than the supermarket one
[43:16] because the supermarket one they have
[43:18] their labels they have their things but
[43:21] do I really know where it's actually
[43:23] coming from well that too and it's it's
[43:27] also like you know let's look at
[43:30] marketplaces right so if we look at
[43:33] classified ads Craigslist Facebook right
[43:37] is you know when they when they start
[43:39] you go oh this is great right I I can
[43:41] buy things from people in my community
[43:43] if I need a new couch fine I go to
[43:44] Facebook Marketplace and I can buy a
[43:47] couch today right um or if I'm looking
[43:50] for a flat or anything like this but
[43:52] then you start to see as it starts to
[43:55] get bigger you the problems with
[43:58] scalability because now right you go to
[44:02] Facebook and How likely are you to get
[44:05] scammed from Facebook marketplace right
[44:07] is like if you want to buy tickets to a
[44:09] concert I I have a friend of mine who
[44:12] invited me to go to a concert with him
[44:15] um and I I never heard of the band um
[44:19] King gizzard and the lizard wizard um
[44:22] awesome band but I said yeah man you buy
[44:25] the tickets I'll go with you he goes oh
[44:26] it's sold out and so I said okay we look
[44:29] on you know try to find them if you if
[44:30] you can get tickets I'll go well he
[44:32] wrote me he was like dude I got scammed
[44:34] on Facebook I sent some guy money money
[44:37] for the tickets I was like well that's
[44:39] your fault you know like I'm sorry but
[44:41] like you know like that sucks but you
[44:44] got to be more careful you know and um
[44:47] we wound up getting tickets um and going
[44:51] to the concert and my friend who who got
[44:54] scammed you know selling these tickets
[44:57] you look at that and it's because you're
[44:59] not interacting with anyone that you can
[45:02] trust on Facebook marketplace right but
[45:07] with
[45:08] vexel that completely changes because
[45:13] right is if somebody if I need to sell
[45:15] concert tickets I can do that but I can
[45:18] see oh I have 10 friends in common so
[45:20] like yeah I'm going to be able this is
[45:21] going to be
[45:22] successful um and so you start
[45:25] introducing this as you know like um
[45:29] Leia my my CEO she wanted to we had like
[45:32] a remstein concert and the hockey world
[45:35] championships in Prague going on so she
[45:37] was like hey it's a really good time to
[45:39] maybe rent my apartment out and earn
[45:42] some extra money to pay for the rent for
[45:44] the next month so she put her apartment
[45:46] up on vexel and was like Hey I'm renting
[45:49] it next thing you know that was like
[45:52] that oh that's a completely different
[45:53] reputation model because you're not just
[45:55] renting to a total strange
[45:57] that can come in a Ramstein concert and
[45:59] destroy your apartment maybe you're
[46:01] renting to someone who goes yeah we have
[46:03] a bunch of friends in common so they're
[46:05] not going to screw up my apartment
[46:06] they're not going to mess anything up so
[46:08] it really starts to introduce that
[46:10] reputation that that truly matters and
[46:13] you know no matter how many it's like
[46:16] you know when you get into a Uber or
[46:19] bolt or anything you know it's like you
[46:20] have your your five star rating there um
[46:24] that doesn't matter that five star
[46:27] rating it it doesn't matter because
[46:29] that's like someone's opinion on a
[46:31] certain interaction but that's not who I
[46:33] am who I am is talk to the people that
[46:35] trust me talk to the people who I know
[46:38] that can vouch for me that's something
[46:40] that's truly different and that's what
[46:44] yeah I had
[46:46] um um the auor of the Liberty Solution
[46:50] on the show Derek Wills is his name and
[46:54] he talked about that because he is um
[46:57] deeply libertarian and he talked about a
[47:01] world where we don't really need like a
[47:04] a monopoly on violence from the state
[47:06] and like third party this is on top of
[47:09] it and we talked about this uh the the
[47:12] examples like when is when what happens
[47:16] like what what do you do when there is a
[47:18] clear court case of a private Court who
[47:20] says like of a third party opinion who
[47:22] says like yes you have to pay him a fine
[47:25] of thousand EUR because you crash The
[47:27] Garden of a house or something like that
[47:29] like there's a clear case uh and uh the
[47:32] court says that but because there's no
[47:35] Monopoly on violence um how can this be
[47:38] enforced and then he was like there is a
[47:41] public reputation system in a private
[47:44] Market because when all of the sudden he
[47:47] uh does not pay his
[47:50] fine uh and the other one can now take
[47:54] this public and say it's like okay he is
[47:56] is like he I have this Court ruling of
[47:59] this private Court uh and it didn't he
[48:02] did not pay me so then uh maybe his
[48:05] employer or maybe his company or
[48:08] whatever he has is now like hm he did
[48:11] not pay that and maybe I have to
[48:13] question my relationship with him so
[48:16] it's not the completely the same with
[48:18] with waxel but I was reminded of of that
[48:20] conversation with him where we like when
[48:24] we all have a reputation like all
[48:26] interact that we have with each other
[48:28] matter and I like real world
[48:31] interactions a lot because people are
[48:33] more friendly and there's one simple
[48:35] reason of that because the chance of
[48:38] getting hit is
[48:39] nonzero if you upset someone the chance
[48:43] of someone actually hitting you is non
[48:45] zero and if you online and um [ __ ]
[48:48] on someone the chances of get you
[48:50] getting hit is zero I mean other than
[48:53] maybe your phone falls on your head but
[48:55] this different story and this is
[48:58] something where like if there's a real
[49:01] world connection and there's a real
[49:02] world okay I'm giving you money I'm I'm
[49:05] getting Ax from that I'm not getting
[49:08] scat scammed like if if someone takes my
[49:10] money and runs away I will run after
[49:14] him yeah and or or you know you'll get
[49:17] your friends who also know that guy and
[49:19] you'll mob together and say hey we're
[49:21] gonna help you right and that's that's
[49:24] it right I there's no nothing that
[49:27] currently exists like that but in the
[49:29] past you know we lived in much smaller
[49:31] communities you know it's like looking
[49:34] at where my grandparents live you know
[49:36] there's like 140 people in their in
[49:39] their city um you know they're little
[49:42] tiny town and reputation matters there
[49:47] growing up I mean my grandparents are
[49:49] people who don't have you know internet
[49:51] who don't do these things so the the how
[49:54] they get things done is they they live
[49:56] in a community they live in a very
[49:57] interesting Community they live in a
[49:59] community full of menites which are like
[50:03] uh Amish light so it's a religious kind
[50:05] of sect that lives and my grandparents
[50:08] live amongst them and um you know it's a
[50:11] very strange diverse kind of community
[50:14] but this little town is a very good
[50:16] example of how reputation in real world
[50:18] reputation works because you know my
[50:21] grandfather has a guy that can solve
[50:25] each and every one of your problems
[50:26] because my grandfather well he's 94
[50:30] years old and spent his whole life
[50:32] gaining trust and gaining an interacting
[50:35] with people in this community so when
[50:37] your car breaks down and or when you
[50:39] have a problem you don't go to the big
[50:41] box you know Walmart Super Center and
[50:44] get your tires located my grand said
[50:46] says let me call this guy he'll help you
[50:49] right and you you do these things based
[50:51] on that real world reputation right is
[50:55] but you go to Walmart you have a
[50:56] experience you leave a five you know a
[50:58] two star review on Google and you know
[51:02] that that becomes this reputation and
[51:03] then it's gained right but but if I
[51:06] trust somebody and he recommends me you
[51:09] I'm gonna okay let's go with it um and
[51:12] if you screw me over that guy's never
[51:14] going to recommend you again never going
[51:16] to work for you so when you kind of look
[51:19] at uh how a community and how a local
[51:23] kind of society should work is yeah I
[51:26] mean
[51:27] again if you come back to if you come to
[51:28] prag I'm going to tell you go eat at
[51:30] this burger restaurant around the corner
[51:31] because these people have taken care of
[51:33] me for two years and they're they make
[51:36] amazing burgers and they're the nicest
[51:38] people ever right so I think when we
[51:42] when we figure out how that tool really
[51:45] kind of can help us and it's it's
[51:48] nothing but positive because you know
[51:51] that which brings benefit is welcome in
[51:55] every society everyone wants things that
[51:57] that bring benefit but anything that
[51:59] doesn't is it should be and is repulsed
[52:02] and pushed away and we should do that so
[52:06] you know you have the ability to kind of
[52:08] also on vexel is like police your own
[52:11] network so if you see something or if
[52:13] you have a bad experience or you have
[52:14] something that you don't like you can
[52:17] flag that offer and it will remove it
[52:20] from your network it won't remove it
[52:22] from from that person who created the
[52:24] Office network but it will remove it
[52:25] from yours
[52:27] so effectively you've policed your
[52:30] network you're helping because that's
[52:32] what it is it's not up to me because we
[52:34] don't we're not able at vexel we're not
[52:36] able to see any of the content that's on
[52:39] vexel
[52:40] whatsoever um so it's up to you if you
[52:44] see something there that you don't like
[52:45] you report you flag that offer it's gone
[52:48] for you if three other people do this
[52:51] it's gone from it's Shadow band right
[52:54] but that doesn't mean you know that like
[52:57] the offer is necessarily bad you're just
[52:58] saying H I don't want to see this offer
[53:00] in my network and I don't want my my
[53:02] people to see this either it's gone but
[53:04] we as a we have no idea what's there
[53:09] but
[53:11] yeah I I love that a lot honestly it's
[53:13] it's um the it brings in not only
[53:18] Bitcoin but it brings in this idea of of
[53:21] the free market a lot when we come back
[53:23] to the individual and there is this
[53:26] saying the only true minority is the
[53:29] individual and everything that empowers
[53:31] the individual and have those convers
[53:34] connections uh is is really valuable
[53:37] which I'm also like I'm looking so
[53:39] forward to Prague uh because uh I made
[53:43] so many great connections to people that
[53:46] were on the podcast that people were
[53:49] with uh just inacted almost daily in my
[53:52] comment sections because they listen to
[53:55] the podcast really regular I just I'm
[53:57] really looking forward to meeting them
[53:59] all in real world and shaking their
[54:01] hands and and talking with them because
[54:03] it's a different uh feeling a different
[54:05] situation when you have someone in in
[54:07] online versus you actually know him in
[54:10] real life and you shook his hand you
[54:12] talk about it you you broke the bread
[54:15] together like you ate something I I I'm
[54:18] I'm I'm really uh pumped about Bitcoin
[54:21] Brock that's why I also make a lot of
[54:23] advertisement on the uh Channel about
[54:25] that but um looking forward to to that
[54:27] and yeah hope hope also to to see you
[54:30] there yeah I mean last year BTC Prague
[54:33] was I would say the most
[54:36] unexpected right it was the first year
[54:39] um you know no one knew kind of what to
[54:41] expect going into it but it turned out
[54:44] to be just the event of the year um the
[54:48] vibe the atmosphere the people the you
[54:51] know they the the kukos brothers they
[54:54] really are passionate about throwing an
[54:57] event that truly celebrates Bitcoin and
[55:00] you can see that in the level of care of
[55:03] knowing how allow to play music so that
[55:06] people don't lose their voices trying to
[55:09] talk to each other and trying to network
[55:11] to the temperature and all of the
[55:13] atmosphere is created to really enable
[55:16] people to have this overwhelming
[55:18] positive experience and um that's what
[55:21] BTC Prague was last year you know it's
[55:23] like they were talking about the Expo
[55:25] area you know you go into any other
[55:27] conference in the Expo area like a yeah
[55:29] you do one or two walkthroughs and
[55:30] you're done but last year the Expo area
[55:34] is where the action was it was where
[55:36] everyone was hanging out talking
[55:38] communicating and it was just something
[55:42] something special I have been to a lot
[55:44] of
[55:45] conferences um BTC Prague is where it's
[55:48] at um but madira Bitcoin Atlantis was
[55:52] really great because you're in the
[55:53] sunshine um that was really nice and the
[55:56] the the temperature was perfect and it
[55:57] was a lot more intimate but BTC Prague I
[56:00] I I cannot wait it's next month um it's
[56:03] coming um we also we have the cipher
[56:06] Punk meetup on the 13th which um is
[56:10] certainly not to be missed if you're if
[56:12] you're here for it please come to the
[56:14] cipher Punk Meetup um it will be lots of
[56:17] fun it's on a boat as well yeah so yeah
[56:22] come love it love it and the last shout
[56:24] out that I will do is uh use my code
[56:27] Robin to get 10% off then we can
[56:31] stop anything about PR uh but honestly
[56:34] it's it's uh like I can only encourage
[56:37] everybody to go there it's it's an
[56:38] amazing experience it kickstarted my
[56:41] podcast honestly uh because it uh
[56:44] inspired me so much uh the event there
[56:47] that it set free some energies in mind
[56:49] and I was like um just going like okay
[56:52] let's let's do something in the Bitcoin
[56:54] Community I had no idea what I want to
[56:55] do but I just started out with talking
[56:58] with people interacting with Twitter
[56:59] with YouTube and all stuff all this the
[57:01] stuff and all of the sudden I'm Bitcoin
[57:03] only I'm working for Bitcoin basically
[57:05] which is an amazing experience uh and
[57:08] yeah I'm I'm thankful for that that's
[57:11] also what's so cool right is that when
[57:14] you start working in Bitcoin um you
[57:17] really start to meet all the people you
[57:18] kind of Meet the people who are creating
[57:20] and who are building and then like you
[57:22] know with me I I go to a lot of
[57:24] conferences I do things and it's like
[57:26] like um I think it was like Nifty who
[57:28] said he's like I love going to
[57:30] conferences is because it's where I get
[57:32] to hang out with my friends you know we
[57:33] only see each other at these events but
[57:36] like we all look forward to we know it's
[57:38] going to be exhausting and we know we're
[57:40] going to be working but I get to as you
[57:42] said break bread and eat and dine and do
[57:44] these things with these people who for
[57:46] me like I've looked up to for so long um
[57:51] like that is why I think Community is so
[57:54] important is you know go find if you do
[57:58] not have a Bitcoin Meetup in your town
[58:01] um create one if you have one go visit
[58:06] meet other bitcoiners because we all are
[58:09] number one I think we're all super
[58:11] positive and optimistic people um in a
[58:14] world where everything is designed to
[58:17] bring you down and make you scared and
[58:19] and fear yes there are lots of toxicity
[58:23] on Twitter as you said you differences
[58:25] between the real world and the online
[58:28] world and that's again where vexel
[58:30] shines is because it is the real it's
[58:32] real and um go to these communities meet
[58:36] meet people in person and talk with them
[58:39] um if you have questions you know like
[58:41] there's so many topics that that need to
[58:44] be discussed in in communities and and
[58:46] people that you know because like you
[58:48] know thinking about stuff like Bitcoin
[58:49] inh heritance right is this is a topic
[58:53] that you could get on the internet and
[58:54] you can do research but you're not going
[58:56] to have the right Solutions you know but
[58:58] talking to other people and getting some
[59:00] ideas can help you fall down different
[59:02] paths to you know making it simple for
[59:05] your heirs to to come in and be able to
[59:07] to take you know control of your Bitcoin
[59:09] if something were to happen to you um
[59:12] but it can also help you understand you
[59:14] know the best way to self- custody the
[59:17] best way to you know start using
[59:19] lightning Network or you know any
[59:21] questions that you might have like if
[59:23] you don't have a Meetup create one you
[59:25] know I'm American so I grew up with the
[59:27] movie Field of Dreams where they said if
[59:29] you build it they will come which is a
[59:31] baseball movie but um yeah if you have a
[59:34] community or if you don't have one start
[59:36] building it because that's you know we
[59:39] we hear about citadels and all these
[59:41] things is yes build your build your
[59:42] Citadel build your Lodge and um you know
[59:46] start talking and the next thing you
[59:48] know is you you find that path to
[59:51] working on bitcoin and working for
[59:52] something that truly ignites that
[59:54] passion in you and you can see that I
[59:56] mean you you said you podcast every day
[59:58] you get to talk about Bitcoin every day
[60:01] and that passion that you have there is
[60:05] what kind of it doesn't feel like work
[60:08] it really like yeah there are days that
[60:10] I have a lot to do and then I'm
[60:12] overwhelmed but at the end of the day it
[60:14] doesn't feel like work because I get to
[60:17] do something that I I love I love doing
[60:20] and where when you say that as like I'm
[60:23] so happy to hear that you had a good
[60:24] experience last year and that you're
[60:26] working in Bitcoin and that's because of
[60:28] BTC prod these are the kind of stories
[60:30] that that I love is you know I that's
[60:33] why I talk about Community is if you
[60:35] want to work in Bitcoin go to a Meetup
[60:37] talk to people figure out what you can
[60:39] do I was an English teacher I was a
[60:42] bitcoiner that was an English teacher I
[60:44] thought that I had to be some sort of
[60:46] tech technical minded person to be able
[60:49] to write code or do something no um my
[60:54] good friend now John John G from you
[60:58] know from the on RAM novel but also his
[61:01] his pseudonym is John G um he I met him
[61:04] in Honeybadger in Ria at Bitcoin honey
[61:07] badger and one of the first things I
[61:09] says so what you do he goes oh I talk to
[61:10] people not machines and I was like dude
[61:13] I'm gonna use that forever because
[61:15] that's that's exactly what you do you
[61:17] know you talk to people and it's such an
[61:19] important part of it is figuring out is
[61:22] that you know you can just learn how to
[61:25] talk to people and help educate and help
[61:27] you know spread what is essentially
[61:30] providing some level of freedom to to
[61:32] the individual and you you touched on
[61:34] something earlier that is so important
[61:36] is that the
[61:38] individual is what is important to me
[61:41] it's not your country it's not your
[61:43] nationality it's none of that it's who
[61:45] you are as an individual how do you
[61:49] contribute to your Social Circle and
[61:52] your society and your community that's
[61:55] what matters
[61:56] and everything is based on those
[61:59] recommendations and having someone that
[62:01] you can trust so looking at where where
[62:05] Bitcoin is now and touching back on the
[62:08] very first question that you answered is
[62:10] that like or that you ask which about
[62:12] these companies is yeah the very first
[62:16] line of the Bitcoin white paper is
[62:17] peer-to-peer electronic cash without a
[62:21] financial
[62:22] institution right now when I look at the
[62:25] state of Bitcoin all I see it seems are
[62:29] financial institutions that are coming
[62:31] in and are trying to mirror The Current
[62:34] financial system that we have in the
[62:36] world and um that's not Bitcoin was anti
[62:42] that that's not what it is we need to
[62:45] really get back to understanding that if
[62:47] if we allow these people to come in and
[62:50] you know kyc everyone and just create a
[62:53] a new banking system on top of what
[62:55] Bitcoin is that then we're Lo we're
[62:57] losing it and at vexel we're fighting
[63:01] that in BTC prog and these communities
[63:04] and these meetups we're fighting that
[63:07] because that's what truly matters is how
[63:10] we use Bitcoin um we have to stop
[63:12] thinking of Bitcoin as an investment
[63:15] start using it and that's where looking
[63:18] at where you said is like bitcoiners are
[63:20] generous that that you get tips and that
[63:22] you receive these things and it's like
[63:23] it's such a good feeling but also so
[63:25] that's like looking at
[63:27] Noster and going into Noster it's like
[63:30] man I love sending zaps I love I love it
[63:33] and that's like SP I'm spending Bitcoin
[63:36] right is every time but it's value for
[63:38] Value again is if you post something
[63:40] that I like I'm gonna I'm G to zap you
[63:42] no matter what um because it's it's fun
[63:47] to spend that to to show someone that
[63:49] you that you appreciate what they did so
[63:53] um proof of work is very important and
[63:56] we're doing it and um you know when you
[63:59] look at somebody who is creating content
[64:01] such as you is yeah You' absolutely
[64:03] deserve because you are proof of work
[64:06] you deserve to have that say someone say
[64:08] thank you for creating this and um
[64:11] that's that's where we're we kind of are
[64:13] we're finally getting into a way that we
[64:14] can do that and we can make these
[64:16] changes uh because now it's becoming
[64:18] more convenient to to use these
[64:20] peer-to-peer platforms and these like
[64:22] things like Noster and to participate in
[64:24] these systems in is to use the ones that
[64:26] they want us to I love it so much uh
[64:29] it's it's almost like when I see all the
[64:33] podcast that I'm doing is like usually
[64:36] the last like the the second half is
[64:38] better than the first half feel like I
[64:40] have to do like longer podcast like
[64:42] three hour podcast like first half hour
[64:45] is to warm up and then then it gets
[64:46] really good uh I just like love to
[64:49] listen to the what you just said um but
[64:52] to to to to conclude the podcast uh
[64:55] before we get into our inro I have one
[64:57] more question for you um what are you
[64:59] currently extremely passionate about
[65:02] which we did not touch on in the podcast
[65:04] is there anything that you're currently
[65:06] learning that you're currently doing
[65:08] activity uh passion whatever it is that
[65:12] we uh forget forgot in the podcast that
[65:14] we did not touch on the
[65:16] podcast yeah I mean one thing that's
[65:20] been very clear to me is you know I have
[65:23] been an educator for a very long time
[65:26] and um I'm ex treaser I worked with
[65:28] treaser um I worked on their knowledge
[65:31] base trying to craft something that
[65:32] could be content that is approachable
[65:34] and convenient for people to learn and
[65:37] um what I'm what I'm really kind of
[65:39] focused on now is actually um creating
[65:43] something that you know meetups and
[65:45] these communities can take to to add
[65:47] value to the meetups there's a lot of
[65:49] these meetups are um you know organized
[65:54] but when you get there is it can be
[65:55] people having beers and you know
[65:57] discussing but there might be new people
[65:59] so we're we're right now we're trying to
[66:01] kind of I'm really kind of create a tool
[66:05] that can really help communities and
[66:06] meetups come together and have topics to
[66:09] talk about to have like the ability to
[66:12] welcome new people into their like
[66:15] Meetup and like ask the right questions
[66:18] and figure out these paths so um you
[66:20] know Plan B has done a really good job
[66:23] with these like exams and this Bitcoin
[66:25] education
[66:26] and there's a lot of these initiatives
[66:28] going around and Bitcoin education is
[66:29] something that I'm very very passionate
[66:31] about currently uh because we need to be
[66:35] able to answer those questions which is
[66:39] all right I've studied Bitcoin I've
[66:41] stopped thinking about Bitcoin as a way
[66:44] to achieve a Lamborghini I've started
[66:46] looking at Bitcoin this way but how do I
[66:49] buy it how do I keep it safe how do I
[66:53] plan for my inheritance these kinds of
[66:55] things um because it's one thing to own
[66:58] Bitcoin um but it's another to learn how
[67:03] to interact with it and so it so my
[67:05] passion is is still in
[67:07] education um and finding ways to help
[67:13] people kind
[67:14] of get there and and understanding and
[67:17] but also have the tools to talk to their
[67:20] aunts and uncles and moms and
[67:22] grandparents and people who don't don't
[67:24] know
[67:26] so um yeah that's where I am right now
[67:29] and hopefully we'll have something soon
[67:31] with with vexel we are we are working on
[67:33] some tools to kind of help Empower
[67:35] meetups and add that value to them is um
[67:40] yeah I hope to have something for
[67:41] everybody soon if you have a Meetup like
[67:43] I said please get in touch um we want to
[67:48] help you grow it that's all we want to
[67:50] do grow local peer-to-peer communities
[67:53] perfect um I will I will just leave it
[67:56] like that because it's it's it's uh
[67:58] wonderful how you said it um we have an
[68:01] end routine in the podcast where the
[68:02] previous guest is asking a question for
[68:04] the next guest without knowing who the
[68:06] next guest is uh which is a really
[68:08] interesting concept because it's like
[68:09] connecting those those guests like like
[68:12] in the blockchain uh pointing to the
[68:14] next guest um the question is and it's
[68:18] an really interesting one what will be
[68:20] the biggest Bitcoin economy outside of
[68:23] the USA in five years the biggest
[68:26] Bitcoin economy outside the USA in five
[68:30] years first of all do you agree that uh
[68:33] USA is the biggest Bitcoin economy only
[68:35] because of sheer number of people yeah I
[68:38] mean
[68:39] yeah
[68:41] but does Europe count I mean how do we
[68:44] look at like if we look at the European
[68:47] Union um what I see is something very
[68:50] different Happening Here in the EU
[68:52] versus the United States here here
[68:55] Community is
[68:58] absolutely at the center of the movement
[69:00] of what's Happening Here in America you
[69:03] know it's coinbase floating a QR code
[69:05] around during the Super Bowl um and you
[69:08] have this still this like ETFs
[69:11] investment kind of thing but I do think
[69:14] that the biggest Bitcoin economy and and
[69:17] what I what I kind of really feel that
[69:19] that is is the ability to spend my
[69:20] Bitcoin the ability to earn Bitcoin the
[69:23] ability to do these things um I do think
[69:25] that there is there are things happening
[69:27] in Europe that are very very cool you
[69:30] know you look at BTC Prague um you know
[69:33] come to Czech Republic you can spend
[69:35] Bitcoin near everywhere like every Pub I
[69:39] go to there's a QR code on the table
[69:41] when I'm done I can pay with lightning
[69:43] and go out and in my you know in my meal
[69:45] so I I do think that Europe is it stands
[69:48] a good chance I also look at you know I
[69:52] look at countries in South America you
[69:54] know these are not big big economies by
[69:56] you know you know currently but I look
[69:59] at them and I I I see Bitcoin growth
[70:01] everywhere I really do but I think
[70:03] Europe will probably be the biggest one
[70:06] yeah I love it so the biggest economy
[70:09] outside of the USA will be the USA
[70:12] because you will be the bigger one um
[70:16] perfect then thank you craft for for
