[00:00] China has banned Bitcoin three or four
[00:01] times how many more times can you ban it
[00:03] Chinese people are still buying quite
[00:04] significant volumes and that volume has
[00:06] been increasing since 20121 who is the
[00:09] next billion the easiest next billion is
[00:11] Chinese people like the Western mind
[00:13] cannot comprehend how hustle Chinese
[00:15] entrepreneurs are even with a government
[00:17] like China that has been so
[00:20] technologically advanced in terms of its
[00:22] surveillance state and its capability
[00:24] it's not able to shut down Bitcoin it's
[00:26] not able to shut down the ability to
[00:28] people to buy and to transact coin is a
[00:30] superior form of saving your wealth and
[00:32] it gets rid of all these restrictions by
[00:34] using Bitcoin you're exiting the system
[00:36] that's the thing the Chinese Communist
[00:37] Party fears the most because it needs to
[00:39] control that system of capital flight
[00:41] because if too much Capital leaves at
[00:42] once then China's whole system kind of
[00:45] starts buckling under a little bit like
[00:47] you're going to see some countries
[00:48] aggressively Embrace Bitcoin with the
[00:50] Strategic Reserve or they'll mine it
[00:52] themselves what's the next country
[00:53] that's going to adopt Bitcoin is legal
[00:55] tender
[00:57] [Music]
[01:00] like what do you think is the current
[01:02] situation actually in China around
[01:04] Bitcoin like what like there's so many
[01:07] confusing things coming out like it is
[01:09] there's mining going on but it's kind of
[01:11] banned like that like there's so much
[01:13] what I hear with with China and the only
[01:16] information that I always have they were
[01:17] the first nation to try really to ban it
[01:20] and stuff like that so what's what's the
[01:23] actual reality right now around Bitcoin
[01:25] in in
[01:26] China yeah it's like a it's a great
[01:29] question people usually ask me that
[01:30] first off um you know there's a lot of
[01:33] confusion around like the bans and stuff
[01:35] like that it seems like China has banned
[01:37] Bitcoin like three or four times how
[01:38] many more times can you ban
[01:40] it but um you know uh I think Chinese
[01:44] people are very much part of the
[01:45] conversation um you know Rob and we met
[01:48] at Bitcoin Amsterdam and you probably
[01:50] saw that there were a lot of uh Chinese
[01:52] entrepreneurs and business people
[01:54] involved at all levels right I mean of
[01:56] course with the mining and of course
[01:58] with providing like mining ships um and
[02:00] A6 and stuff like that but also like you
[02:04] know you see them you see Chinese
[02:05] entrepreneurs kind of working in like
[02:06] layer 2os um you know there's developers
[02:09] that work for like prominent Bitcoin
[02:11] companies and stuff like that so
[02:12] definitely a huge part of the ecosystem
[02:15] um from what I heard even though there
[02:17] is kind of like um a mining band of
[02:19] sorts and we can talk a little bit more
[02:21] about that um there are still miners in
[02:23] China I think I've talked to a couple of
[02:25] people who have indicated to me I don't
[02:27] have like final final confirmation but
[02:30] like there's still some mining going on
[02:31] in Shing Jang for example like on a
[02:33] pretty systematic basis apparently it
[02:35] never really was shut down and there
[02:37] seems to be Bitcoin miners that are you
[02:40] know still operating uh within China um
[02:43] to give you a quick example I know
[02:45] Daniel baton had a report out with
[02:46] Bitcoin magazine um and um there are
[02:50] some things there to discuss but they
[02:52] did get like three or four sources uh
[02:55] that uh talked about Bitcoin mining in
[02:58] China despite the ban
[03:00] um and the other part of that is like
[03:01] there's actually a Chinese a senior
[03:03] Communist Party official in
[03:05] fuo uh which is actually my um I was
[03:08] born there but anyways um he got
[03:10] arrested for uh still promoting Bitcoin
[03:13] mining even after you know Le and the
[03:17] kind of moratorium was established on
[03:19] new mining sites so there seems to be
[03:22] still like active mining it's probably
[03:24] if I were to guess like some private
[03:26] mining uh private mining when it comes
[03:29] to like private power companies or maybe
[03:31] local governments China has is a little
[03:35] bit of like in an economic downturn one
[03:37] of the consequences of that is that the
[03:39] local governments don't have uh a lot of
[03:42] tax revenue um and so there's a lot of
[03:45] incentive if you have like stranded
[03:47] power and things like that to work
[03:48] through that um now all the other I mean
[03:51] you know from what I've heard uh bit
[03:53] Main and other companies they've moved a
[03:56] lot of their manufacturing chain out of
[03:58] China um even though they're
[04:00] chinese-based companies there are uh
[04:03] Trump well Trump imposed these like
[04:05] tariffs and Biden actually like made
[04:07] them higher so if you're if you create
[04:10] like Chinese made Goods including
[04:11] Chinese made semiconductors and Chinese
[04:13] made computer chips which A6 would fall
[04:15] under um there's like strong incentives
[04:17] to manufacture them in countries outside
[04:19] of China now so that that is one thing
[04:20] that's happening and then the thing that
[04:22] people always ask me is like well do
[04:23] people still buy Bitcoin in China right
[04:26] like is that you know like are they
[04:28] still part of the price story
[04:30] um and uh in many ways yes I think the
[04:33] most so I'm I'm working I can kind of
[04:37] say I'm that I'm working on more
[04:40] qualitative research because it's really
[04:42] hard to do quantitative research um
[04:44] because there is no public uh yen to
[04:48] bitcoin pairing because there is uh an
[04:51] exchange ban so technically the
[04:54] exchanges should not serve chinese-based
[04:58] people now uh china-based people uh that
[05:01] are Chinese citizens now um I have
[05:05] talked with a few people and uh if you
[05:07] have Chinese uh citizenship and Chinese
[05:10] identity documents but you put your
[05:12] address outside of China those exchanges
[05:15] will still serve you so there's that and
[05:18] then there's a a bunch of different ways
[05:20] people can get involved like in general
[05:23] um it it's basically over the counter
[05:26] trading like there isn't like a public
[05:29] Ledger
[05:30] because if there was a public Ledger and
[05:31] someone acknowledged that they were
[05:33] taking Yen for Bitcoin or Yen for tether
[05:36] as is the case for most people actually
[05:39] um then that would be
[05:41] illegal um for that service right so
[05:44] it's hard to get like concrete concrete
[05:46] numbers the closest thing you have from
[05:48] like a quantitative perspective is chain
[05:49] analysis does a report they track like
[05:52] several Chinese OTC desks so uh some of
[05:55] it is like knowing which addresses are
[05:58] associated with the OTC desk that are
[06:00] folded within traditional exchanges so
[06:02] say for example you can imagine like a
[06:04] binance right binance has like an OTC
[06:06] division as well some of it is also just
[06:08] knowing you know having relationships
[06:10] with the OTC desks I've interviewed some
[06:12] of the OTC desks but not in a systematic
[06:14] way like chain analysis does so they
[06:17] have this um report I'm can share it
[06:20] with you after um the the conversation
[06:23] but basically it just shows that the
[06:25] number of inflows has been steadily
[06:28] increasing and terms of China based
[06:30] interest from OTC desks so I think um
[06:33] let me just actually look at it right
[06:34] now because I have it in front of me or
[06:36] I had it in front of me let me just take
[06:38] a quick look uh sorry okay here it is so
[06:42] they have like this thing it's like
[06:43] total value received by select China
[06:45] based otc's and you see in 2021 it was
[06:49] like about5 billion do or six or seven
[06:52] give or take and now uh per quarter um
[06:56] and now we're in Q2 2024 the latest that
[06:58] they released this stats and it's about
[07:00] like 21 or or you know 22 or 23 billion
[07:04] doar and that's like a lower bound
[07:07] because they don't like I actually
[07:08] talked to the chain analysis team and
[07:10] they don't actually track every I mean
[07:12] you can't right like there's probably
[07:14] like a million ways people are buying
[07:17] Bitcoin uh maybe not a million but like
[07:19] a lot of ways that people are buying
[07:20] Bitcoin that you just can't quite record
[07:22] but from what we're seeing um there's a
[07:24] very clean and simple story which is
[07:26] that his economy is doing pretty badly
[07:29] right now there's like pretty high youth
[07:30] unemployment rate um and also you know
[07:34] if you're invested in Chinese stocks or
[07:36] you're invested in Chinese real estate
[07:39] those have been going declining in value
[07:42] quite significantly uh some people have
[07:44] lost you know I've seen 60% loss on
[07:47] their stock portfolio right or like 30%
[07:50] loss on like real estate if you bought
[07:52] in um one of the top cities in China um
[07:56] so there's a strong incentive now for
[07:58] people to get their money out of the
[08:00] system because in China there's not
[08:02] really like a way to make there's not
[08:04] like rapid inflation or anything there's
[08:06] actually more deflationary right now
[08:08] although the way China measures
[08:09] inflation I mean as with all things you
[08:12] know all Chinese metrics beware but um
[08:15] it seems like the problem is more that
[08:17] people can't make uh money not not
[08:21] necessarily in the base currency but the
[08:22] base currency Chinese people save a lot
[08:25] and then all the assets that they're
[08:26] saving in there's like destruction of
[08:28] wealth like Mass massive destruction of
[08:30] wealth um and so you know how to get
[08:33] people out and it seems to be the case
[08:35] that since China's economy is struggled
[08:38] not only has there been more monetary
[08:39] stimulus which is probably heard about
[08:41] and we can talk a little bit more but
[08:43] also we are seeing um you know more and
[08:46] more through all the quantitative stats
[08:49] that we can see interest in Bitcoin from
[08:52] China and and that Chinese people are
[08:54] still buying quite significant volumes
[08:56] and that volume has been increasing
[08:58] since 2020 21 which is kind of when the
[09:00] bands kind of kicked in and actually
[09:02] recently I would say they're close to
[09:04] highs or alltime highs Bloomberg came
[09:06] out with like a report based off of the
[09:08] chain analysis research that was saying
[09:09] that you know Chinese people are buying
[09:11] in so Chinese people are still a very
[09:13] big part of the story I think they're
[09:14] the easiest you know how people us
[09:16] bitcoiners always talking about like who
[09:18] is the next billion um the easiest next
[09:21] billion is Chinese people I think
[09:24] absolutely they they they're one of the
[09:26] groups that that needed the most and
[09:28] it's interesting thing if I understand
[09:30] it correct government is Banning Bitcoin
[09:33] exchanges and Bitcoin Miners and
[09:35] therefore also by um Banning are they
[09:39] also Banning the Bitcoin trade like you
[09:41] cannot trade with Bitcoin there or like
[09:44] the everything that is Bitcoin touching
[09:47] the their Banning is is that right um so
[09:50] yeah this is where we want to get into a
[09:52] little bit of the detail so first thing
[09:54] is that you know Hong Kong and China are
[09:55] separate and Hong Kong has a very robust
[09:58] like so you you will have the ability to
[10:00] transact Bitcoin with OTC desks um there
[10:04] there is something in Hong Kong law I
[10:07] mean who knows if this will stay forever
[10:09] because you know China has changed a lot
[10:11] of things with Hong Kong a little bit
[10:12] off topic for this podcast but that's
[10:14] that's its own other rabbit hole but um
[10:17] Hong Kong has this thing called the
[10:18] basic law which is kind of like their
[10:20] constitution of sorts and so uh that's
[10:23] why in Hong Kong you know there's the
[10:25] regulated exchanges uh and and I don't
[10:28] think there will ever not be an ability
[10:30] at least for the next few years to not
[10:32] trade Bitcoin for Hong Kong dollars so
[10:35] the Hong Kong dollar is pretty
[10:36] convertible to bitcoin and in Hong Kong
[10:39] right now what's actually interesting is
[10:41] even in addition to the regulated
[10:43] exchanges being allowed in Hong Kong and
[10:44] of course they have the spot ETF and
[10:46] Futures ETF and things like that um
[10:49] there also are a lot of um I went to one
[10:53] last time I was in Hong Kong they're
[10:55] like these physical cash shops um and
[10:57] they're much much better
[11:00] rates um I think like when I was there
[11:02] it was like uh don't quote me on this
[11:05] like 2.5 or 3% it's much lower than a
[11:07] Bitcoin ATM so you can go and you can
[11:10] get yeah and that still exists they're
[11:12] kind of currently trading under like a
[11:14] peer-to-peer
[11:15] exemption um and so a lot of people I
[11:19] I've had a few friends there's actually
[11:20] like a mall in Hong Kong where there's
[11:22] like a bunch of these shops and they
[11:24] transact in lightning which is also
[11:25] really cool so you can go you can bring
[11:27] your SATs on Lightning you can work
[11:29] directly with that person um because
[11:31] even in like other places like turkey or
[11:34] or other places I've been to the OTC
[11:36] desks they're mostly on binance right I
[11:39] guess binance has enabled lightning
[11:40] recently but um typically they use
[11:43] onchain so you would use onchain or you
[11:45] use usdt and uh apparently the Hong Kong
[11:48] area so there's there's like quite a
[11:50] sophisticated trading environment in
[11:52] Hong Kong and so far even though
[11:54] technically the peer-to-peer trade and
[11:56] the over the- counter trading well the
[11:58] over the-counter trade G or the cash
[12:00] shops might become illegal because Hong
[12:03] Kong just wants to do regulated
[12:04] exchanges um but um they peer-to-peer
[12:08] trade is an exemption in Hong Kong so
[12:11] just if you want one takeaway from
[12:13] everything I just said Hong Kong
[12:14] different from China and there is quite
[12:16] a bit of a robust trading ecosystem in
[12:19] Hong Kong um though um you know one
[12:22] other thing to know about Hong Kong as
[12:23] it's very like web 3 based um so there's
[12:26] a lot of other crypto so a lot of these
[12:29] shops I mentioned to you they made a lot
[12:31] of money on like
[12:32] salana eth or like whatever so they're
[12:35] not necessarily like Bitcoin only and
[12:37] they also trade a lot with tether um
[12:40] China itself like mainland China um so
[12:44] just the difference I mean mainland
[12:45] China is basically like all the regions
[12:47] outside of like Hong Kong Macau Etc um
[12:51] so uh I think mainland China is probably
[12:53] what people think of when they think of
[12:55] China per se um and uh the thing with
[13:00] mainland China is like you know um yeah
[13:04] like it it's similar to the VPN ban
[13:08] meaning like if you're an individual
[13:10] trying to get across the VPN ban in
[13:13] China there's so many people that use
[13:14] VPN by the way like they're all over the
[13:18] the like um it's called like flipping
[13:21] the great firewall like a lot of people
[13:22] do that you know I I I don't know
[13:25] exactly how many but if I were to like
[13:27] quickly estimate it's definitely
[13:29] millions of people right um and it's
[13:33] kind of a similar Dynamic so if you are
[13:35] a company providing
[13:37] vpns to Chinese people that is like a
[13:40] pretty big risk they will go after you
[13:42] your assets they'll try to jail you so
[13:45] similar to that if you're like an OTC
[13:47] broker like they jailed the quote
[13:49] unquote crypto king of China right
[13:52] because this guy was talking loud he was
[13:54] trading a lot he was selling a lot and
[13:56] buying a lot in bulk right so people
[13:58] like that that's like multi-year jail
[14:01] sentences that's like you know they
[14:02] really go to crack down hard on you um
[14:05] in terms of like individuals there have
[14:08] been cases but yeah it's not as like
[14:12] systematic like in the sense of like
[14:14] people still do trade peer-to-peer right
[14:17] they also trade a lot with the
[14:18] over-the-counter trading it's kind of a
[14:20] gray zone right like you shouldn't be
[14:23] doing it as an individual there have
[14:24] been people that have been arrested for
[14:26] trading um more tether thanit coin um
[14:30] that's also another thing a lot of
[14:32] Chinese people usually buy tether versus
[14:33] like Bitcoin itself but um the uh actual
[14:39] number of arrests there is usually quite
[14:42] if you're not doing things in addition
[14:45] to that I've seen like six-month jail
[14:47] sentences but it's not like a systematic
[14:49] thing like there's no way they're
[14:50] imprisoning everyone that's like buying
[14:52] and selling Bitcoin we just talked about
[14:54] how maybe there's like 20 billion dollar
[14:56] in trading volume per quarter in inflows
[14:59] to OTC desks right and I've seen like
[15:02] maybe like a few thousand people be
[15:04] arrested I'm not saying that's a small
[15:05] amount and I'm still saying that's like
[15:07] kind of a big deal um but it's
[15:10] definitely not like anywhere close I
[15:12] think to like the volume people who
[15:14] actually are trading in these things um
[15:17] so yeah it's kind of like a gray Zone um
[15:20] you know if you do get caught there is a
[15:22] chance your account gets Frozen um
[15:24] that's actually been a thing I've seen
[15:26] where like uh some of the exchanges
[15:29] especially the ones with like Chinese
[15:31] background like they used to be in China
[15:33] and then they left I think they still
[15:35] kind of cooperate with uh the Chinese
[15:39] authorities like the Chinese authorities
[15:40] cite them in cases where they've made
[15:43] arrests um and I know one or two
[15:46] anecdotes that have been told to me of
[15:49] like the exchanges freezing
[15:51] accounts um that belong to certain
[15:53] people but I mean obviously and this is
[15:55] the beauty of Bitcoin right like if
[15:57] you're trading peer-to-peer
[15:59] and you're like kind of like hey let's
[16:01] meet in a in a group or whatever you
[16:03] can't really stop that and then if
[16:06] you're trading over the counter um the
[16:08] typically the broker is taking all the
[16:10] risk but you as a buyer don't
[16:13] necessarily take that much risk if that
[16:16] makes sense I really quickly because I
[16:19] I'm really aware always that there might
[16:21] be someone in that is kind of now what
[16:23] is over the counter so like can can you
[16:25] quickly explain like what is over the
[16:27] counter trading like what
[16:30] yeah sorry about that yeah I uh good
[16:33] check um so I mean obviously most people
[16:37] um you know when they deal with Bitcoin
[16:39] I would say there's kind of like three
[16:40] main ways that people get Bitcoin right
[16:43] one main way is through exchanges so you
[16:45] do you go in you
[16:47] kyc uh then you kind of uh go and
[16:50] purchase um Bitcoin that way right like
[16:53] if you sign up for coinbase or in Europe
[16:55] it might be like relay or I don't know
[16:57] what right like but there's all these
[16:58] different kinds of exchanges uh Chinese
[17:01] people in that sense they kind of can
[17:04] put a fake address or they can put an
[17:06] address they own outside and so they can
[17:08] still kind of trade in that way the
[17:10] other way is peer-to-peer right that's
[17:12] like you go uh to like a laundromat you
[17:14] go to like somewhere you just like meet
[17:17] up or you go to meetups and you're just
[17:19] like hey here's some cash okay here's
[17:22] some STS give me a receiving address and
[17:23] you send it overthe counter is kind of
[17:27] typically it's for more private
[17:29] transactions because the exchanges the
[17:32] the throughput on there is um more or
[17:35] less public because most people are able
[17:38] to trace the exchange addresses and so
[17:41] if you're making Market moving amounts
[17:44] of uh money then you have an incentive
[17:47] to use the over-the-counter trading desk
[17:49] because these are kind of like private
[17:50] Arrangements they kind of on uh the
[17:53] chain look like I mean they look like
[17:56] large transactions of which we don't
[17:57] know the origin of basically right um
[18:01] but the OTC desk work pretty similar to
[18:03] like I I've written a couple articles
[18:05] about it they kind of work like private
[18:06] banking in a way um and so you go like
[18:10] basically you go to the spot and they
[18:13] usually have physical spots but
[18:14] sometimes it's online and then you say
[18:16] like hey I want to buy Bitcoin on bulk
[18:19] and they have their requirements they do
[18:20] their own whatever documentation and
[18:22] stuff like that and then once you're in
[18:24] they're like buying on your behalf
[18:27] basically um now the reason why Chinese
[18:29] people would use over-the-counter over
[18:31] exchanges is because again exchanges
[18:33] don't really um you know uh operate uh
[18:37] in China to that degree I think if
[18:39] you're buying really large amounts that
[18:41] becomes like kind of an issue you want
[18:43] kind of like that privacy and then the
[18:45] over-the-counter desks depending on I
[18:49] mean obviously for me I'm like a writer
[18:51] and a journalist so when I ever asked
[18:54] people they've always been like they're
[18:56] never going to be like oh we take money
[18:57] from China you know or you know what I'm
[18:59] saying but in theory I mean you could
[19:02] hypoth I think it's happening and based
[19:05] off of the chain analysis figures like
[19:07] you could if you're like an OTC desk and
[19:09] you're based out of like not China right
[19:11] maybe you're in Singapore maybe you're
[19:13] somewhere else right and you you're just
[19:14] buying on behalf of someone else right
[19:17] and maybe they have uh Bank Reserves
[19:20] outside of China or maybe they have
[19:23] there is um a system to Route payments
[19:25] within China and then for you to get
[19:27] usdt or Bitcoin out that is kind of like
[19:30] the riskiest of what we call the
[19:32] over-the-counter trading uh departments
[19:34] and typically uh why it is that way is
[19:38] because the exchanges the Bitcoin
[19:40] exchanges like binance okx KB they
[19:42] refuse to take the risk um so the risk
[19:46] in China is that it's
[19:48] illegal uh it's basically like if you
[19:50] work for an over-the-counter trading
[19:52] desk that's doing a lot of sales even if
[19:54] you're abroad China's government has
[19:56] threatened to arrest and has arrested
[19:58] some of those people so even if you're
[20:00] like abroad and you're working an OTC
[20:02] desk and you are
[20:03] knowingly uh accepting Chinese yen in
[20:06] order to get like Bitcoin or tether
[20:10] there is um that kind of a system where
[20:14] um you know uh there's these kind of
[20:16] like
[20:17] Merchants they deposit collateral into
[20:20] like binance or Hobby and then they're
[20:24] discoverable on binance and hobby but
[20:26] binance isn't really doing that and I
[20:29] mean that in the sense of
[20:30] over-the-counter in that that is one um
[20:35] it's not like through the exchange it's
[20:36] like you actually are dealing with kind
[20:38] of like a private relationship but it's
[20:40] mediated by the exchanges if that makes
[20:43] sense so hopefully that helps I mean if
[20:45] the over the counter training like I
[20:46] would think about it like um exchanges
[20:49] are like Banks um but I'm just making
[20:53] this as an example um and over the
[20:55] counter trading desk are kind of like
[20:56] you know how like there's private
[20:57] banking or like there's kind of hedge
[20:59] funds or things like that that's kind of
[21:01] like what that is it it's super
[21:03] interesting when you look at the
[21:04] conversation because like I have in
[21:08] Austria this orange ping conversations
[21:10] with people that are complete normies
[21:13] that are like I don't know like from a
[21:15] good friend the uncle or something like
[21:17] that and then there's like a message
[21:18] like hey do do you want to talk with him
[21:20] about Bitcoin and like hey okay let's
[21:22] set up a quick uh video call and there I
[21:25] see kind of like what the absolute Norm
[21:28] is
[21:29] uh think about Bitcoin and what their
[21:31] concerns are with Bitcoin even if they
[21:33] are interested in and one question that
[21:36] comes up since the last like four years
[21:38] or five years that I do that is like
[21:41] will the uh EU ban it will America ban
[21:45] it will people like will it be banned am
[21:48] I follow and and that's in Austria like
[21:52] we have Bitcoin only exchanges we have a
[21:55] like economy here it's
[21:57] regulated uh politicians acknowledges
[22:00] like nobody is pushing against Bitcoin
[22:02] in Austria in a big way anything like
[22:04] that so uh Bitcoin is a normal thing
[22:08] here in Austria but still people are
[22:10] afraid uh of it because there are some
[22:13] talks and this is where I imagine when
[22:17] the same thing is happening in China
[22:19] where you actually have these cases of
[22:21] people getting arrested for buying
[22:23] Bitcoin for people actually um having
[22:26] that fear of like oh like I don't don't
[22:28] want to be on the bad side of the
[22:30] government I I guess adoption is really
[22:33] hard in in China um and like really
[22:37] getting the ball rolling uh for that
[22:39] obviously you cannot stop it because
[22:41] people uh will still uh educate
[22:44] themselves and they have access to to
[22:46] that education and they also can access
[22:49] Bitcoin as you just explained but I
[22:51] guess the the adoption is is uh is kind
[22:54] of difficult which leads me up to my
[22:55] next question how do you think bit coin
[22:58] will uh in Impact China long term and
[23:02] maybe let's stay with uh mainland China
[23:05] as you said Hong Kong is is quite
[23:07] different yeah yeah um no great question
[23:11] um I mean first off I want to say one
[23:13] thing about why I wrote the book um and
[23:16] so it is kind of to uh reassure some of
[23:20] these us people and some of the European
[23:21] people you mentioning um because China
[23:24] has tried I think one of the strongest
[23:26] versions of trying to ban Bitcoin right
[23:29] and so uh people should rest assured
[23:32] even though there was so much Bitcoin
[23:33] mining in the hash rate and remember
[23:35] back in the 2020 you know the fud was
[23:39] the other way like Ripple CEO was saying
[23:41] like Bitcoin was controlled by China and
[23:42] like if China does anything then
[23:44] bitcoin's gonna die right and we we saw
[23:46] what happened I mean the hash rate went
[23:48] down a little
[23:49] bit uh howed for quite a bit of time I
[23:52] shouldn't say a little bit but then you
[23:54] know we're way past recovery at this
[23:56] point both on the price level from like
[23:59] activity and metrics and things like
[24:00] that so there is an article I wrote uh I
[24:02] have this site called chinabitcoin
[24:04] book.com uh guy Swan actually did
[24:07] a he did a narration of it and the idea
[24:10] was like you can't really ban Bitcoin
[24:12] like a government can't really fully ban
[24:14] Bitcoin or a government will refuse to
[24:16] take most of the steps and I have to say
[24:18] that China has uh not necessarily done
[24:22] like everything they possibly could um
[24:25] but at the same time they've done a lot
[24:26] of really big things that you would
[24:28] expect other countries to follow like
[24:31] the mining ban I think is something that
[24:33] like the European Union is looking at
[24:34] very seriously right um or I've heard I
[24:38] mean I I I don't know about that in as
[24:40] much detail but I've definitely heard of
[24:42] things like for example New York State
[24:44] there was kind of like some policy being
[24:45] considered Etc
[24:48] um so the thing with that is that like
[24:51] even with a government like China that
[24:54] has um you know been
[24:59] so uh technologically advanced in terms
[25:01] of its surveillance state and its
[25:03] capability it's not able to shut down
[25:05] Bitcoin it's not able to shut down the
[25:07] ability to people to buy and to transact
[25:10] um and not only that it doesn't even
[25:12] seem to have really dampened the
[25:14] interest because now as we were just
[25:17] talking about the interest in China
[25:18] seems to be at least two or 3x what it
[25:21] used to be even you know during the time
[25:24] of the Bands um now there was some uh
[25:28] demand or volume that went down
[25:31] according to chain analysis um around
[25:33] that time but it seems like now we're
[25:35] looking at all-time highs and like
[25:37] recovery and things like that so um even
[25:41] though adoption is so difficult in a
[25:44] context like China there are so many
[25:46] strong drivers that people are willing
[25:49] to go out and be a part of the ecosystem
[25:52] anyways not only in terms of um what I
[25:55] found really interesting is not only in
[25:56] terms of the price I mean obviously the
[25:58] price is a big deal I would say my rough
[26:01] estimate is that like 99% of the people
[26:04] are in it for money at this point right
[26:06] and that's why you know sometimes they
[26:09] they do coining sometimes they you
[26:11] know they're on Tether they they do
[26:13] tokens they do whatever um you know but
[26:18] um what I would also say about that is
[26:20] like there seems to be kind of that
[26:22] educational component coming in too I
[26:24] actually yesterday I had an interview
[26:26] it's almost like the reverse I had an
[26:27] interview with uh someone who um knows
[26:30] quite a bit about Bitcoin but is like
[26:33] more of a China commentator right um and
[26:36] then now we're here and and Robin I
[26:38] think in some of your questions you know
[26:40] somewhat about China but obviously like
[26:42] you're really big on the Bitcoin space
[26:44] right but what I presume I know almost
[26:48] nothing about China okay all right fine
[26:51] presum that you know almost nothing
[26:52] about China all right that's fine um but
[26:55] uh okay but um basically
[26:58] uh right now what's what what is
[27:01] happening is that you will see uh
[27:05] people you know I was talking to him and
[27:07] he's like oh my audience thinks like
[27:09] Bitcoin is a little bit of a scam and
[27:11] like this and that you know there's a
[27:12] lot of those kind of Curves uh when that
[27:14] comes to discussion but a lot of people
[27:17] are in it they're trading they're buying
[27:19] they're doing like more of the price and
[27:21] then the coolest thing is there's this
[27:22] like smaller portion but like they're on
[27:25] Noster they're on like these different
[27:26] places and these are true Cipher punks
[27:29] and that is very cool to think about
[27:31] like people who are uh able to be
[27:34] inspired not just by bitcoin's price and
[27:36] actually they're very similar to you
[27:38] know I think some bitcoiners uh
[27:40] obviously the price is very important
[27:42] but then also just like thinking about
[27:44] the self- custody element thinking about
[27:46] you know the Privacy element and
[27:48] thinking about these kind of things like
[27:49] I've seen on Noster people do education
[27:51] on like here's how you bypass like the
[27:54] the ban on telegram China has like this
[27:56] thing where telegram won't work unless
[27:58] you have a VPN um and most people will
[28:01] get on telegram to like interact uh in
[28:03] the quote unquote crypto community in
[28:05] China um so you start to see things like
[28:08] that you start to see Bitcoin Maxis uh
[28:11] and people who are actually teaching
[28:14] people like hey like it's not just about
[28:16] the price of like XY Z Dogecoin or like
[28:19] whatever um it's also about like what it
[28:23] means you know like to have custody over
[28:26] your own funds to have have access to be
[28:29] able to transact in a way that you
[28:31] choose in a privacy setting that you
[28:33] might choose as well and I think for for
[28:36] a country like China this is like a
[28:38] little bit easier right now to to
[28:40] understand because um I was actually
[28:42] talking to will uh from Damas who
[28:45] created the the Nostra app Damas and we
[28:48] were actually both talking about this
[28:49] like for most people when you're in the
[28:51] in between State you can kind of like as
[28:54] long as access is not denied to you
[28:56] that's when people get really mad so
[28:58] like when you're buying Bitcoin in
[29:01] Canada or in the United States or in
[29:03] Europe right like um you know some
[29:07] people might get a little bit frustrated
[29:08] about the fact that um you can or or
[29:12] can't buy at certain amounts without
[29:14] like certain documents or things like
[29:16] that right but the truth is like you can
[29:19] still as of now buy uh Bitcoin in many
[29:23] different ways right across Europe
[29:26] across all these different places
[29:28] um in China though you you like hit like
[29:31] these like walls like from a user
[29:34] experience standpoint it's just like you
[29:35] can't actually access these things like
[29:37] literally you go to the App Store you
[29:38] can't find an app or literally you go to
[29:42] an exchange and it says like well you
[29:44] look like you're in China and we refuse
[29:46] to serve like Chinese customers right uh
[29:49] but that's not true of just like Phoenix
[29:51] or whatever if you're thinking about the
[29:52] states that's true of like pretty much
[29:54] almost every service that exists so it
[29:57] becomes comes like a technical block
[29:59] right and then that's where like the
[30:01] adoption is a struggle but I almost
[30:05] point to China as like a positive
[30:06] example of like when the incentives are
[30:08] so strong right and I think what'll end
[30:13] up happening is if Europe and the United
[30:15] States do something similar to China and
[30:17] they try to block people from making
[30:20] their own financial decisions they try
[30:22] to block people from accessing Bitcoin
[30:25] you're GNA see uh a similar kind of um
[30:29] surge of demand from people who are uh
[30:33] feel like they're missing out from the
[30:35] opportunity of saving in a true
[30:38] appreciating store of
[30:40] value uh and I think you're going to see
[30:43] people like realize the importance of It
[30:46] kind of like how you know when Twitter
[30:48] was down in or X was down in Brazil
[30:51] people had no choice so then they
[30:53] started thinking about like those
[30:55] different options if that makes sense so
[30:57] now I think the struggle a little bit I
[30:59] found because I also grew up in Canada
[31:01] like I find the struggles is more like
[31:03] there um seem to be a lot of options
[31:06] like there isn't like a full block like
[31:09] yeah if you put that you're buying
[31:10] Bitcoin in your bank transfers the your
[31:13] bank will probably stop you or you might
[31:14] get debanked right and then that's like
[31:17] a thing that like quite a few people
[31:19] have faced uh in Canada we had the
[31:21] trucker protest and like obviously there
[31:23] were people who were censored and denied
[31:25] their funds and so those people you know
[31:28] resonate with that experience but almost
[31:29] in China you can almost imagine that the
[31:31] entire country has been subjected to
[31:33] that experience and so it's like an
[31:34] interesting grounds to see how adoption
[31:37] and education could still be very
[31:40] resilient um I believe if Europe and the
[31:43] United States uh take the path of um
[31:47] being more like China in some ways and
[31:50] in some ways you know this is a separate
[31:52] discussion but in some ways I feel like
[31:54] the the American surveillance State and
[31:56] other surveillance States also are very
[32:00] Advanced they don't they don't like
[32:02] outright ban you and things like that or
[32:05] they don't outright jail you for now for
[32:07] certain actions but uh it's almost more
[32:10] pervasive because there's more data kind
[32:12] of collected um and I think it depends
[32:15] on like we we grow up with like a
[32:19] setting that we assume we live in a
[32:21] Utopia and the one thing about China
[32:24] that I always try to tell people is like
[32:25] China is just like a country it's a got
[32:28] a government that's like very techno
[32:29] nationalist it's very hard on people um
[32:33] that's my opinion obviously um but it
[32:36] it's not like just because there is a
[32:38] dystopian elements to China that you
[32:41] can't see the same thing here in Canada
[32:44] and the United States and in Europe and
[32:46] it's more a matter of like China is like
[32:49] a government or a nation state that
[32:51] takes some things to an extreme but you
[32:54] got to be careful with a this can happen
[32:56] here and B um just because you know
[33:00] China is this like mysterious exotic
[33:02] place or whatever it doesn't mean that
[33:04] those principles don't also come here
[33:06] power of corrupts absolutely whether
[33:08] that's in China or in the west I
[33:11] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[33:14] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece

[35:22] sovereignty 100% And I saw it already I
[35:26] mean it's not that bad
[35:28] but I saw it firsthand in my account um
[35:31] I worked one year uh outside of Austria
[35:35] which was in Germany and there had a new
[35:39] company uh the company had a new bank
[35:41] account uh and I had the same bank
[35:43] account basically that I had in Austria
[35:45] because you don't need a German bank
[35:47] account you can use your Austrian bank
[35:49] account because of the EU uh and I from
[35:52] this bank account it's like there's
[35:54] money coming in there's some expenses
[35:56] and almost everything else go goes to
[35:58] some Bitcoin exchange that that's how my
[36:01] bank account looks uh and uh I didn't
[36:05] knew it but my account got red flaged
[36:08] because of that and uh the first salary
[36:11] that the German uh a company wanted to
[36:15] send me they came back to me and said
[36:17] like oh like we cannot transfer you um
[36:21] something because the bank called us and
[36:24] said like oh there seems to be an
[36:27] fraudulent transaction and And the
[36:29] Company CEO said like no I did that
[36:32] transaction and she's like are you sure
[36:35] it's a it's a red flagged account and
[36:38] then he came to me and like hey uh is
[36:41] are you sure that that Ian and and
[36:42] everything is is correct your ID and I
[36:45] was like yeah that's correct and he's
[36:47] like yeah your bank account is red
[36:49] flagged what are you doing oh yeah so
[36:52] this is also happening here it's it's
[36:56] just like it there's no consequence
[36:58] because the transaction then got through
[37:02] uh and then the bank said like okay now
[37:04] it's it's like we deleted that red flag
[37:06] of that account also because now we know
[37:08] okay it's actually the person that works
[37:09] and stuff like that uh but there are no
[37:12] small things in place um and sometimes I
[37:16] think we not that far away from that um
[37:19] there may be a different there there
[37:21] there might be a big difference in there
[37:23] but it's not that we are complete
[37:26] freedom there's like nothing going on
[37:28] like that there's a lot like that going
[37:30] on I also tried to get a credit and I
[37:33] had to get to like I don't know 30 I
[37:36] just wanted to to try it out uh I I had
[37:39] to go through 30 uh com uh Banks to for
[37:43] one to like say like okay let's let's do
[37:45] it and for everyone the same reason was
[37:47] like oh we see those Bitcoin
[37:49] transactions we don't like that
[37:50] currently uh I don't know if it's still
[37:53] like that it's it's some years ago but
[37:56] uh it's it's really interesting how
[37:58] Bitcoin is also seen here as something
[38:02] something not good like something
[38:04] fraudulent it changed a lot actually in
[38:07] the last few years I have the feeling
[38:08] but uh it's it's not uh I just wanted to
[38:12] bring that a perspective of an Austrian
[38:14] also here because it's still still like
[38:17] that I think there's a lot going on but
[38:21] you brought up your book and it's
[38:23] actually something that I wanted to
[38:24] bring in all earlier but uh yeah um what
[38:28] is the the book about the book is called
[38:31] ma uh would ma hold uh Bitcoin first of
[38:34] all for those who don't know who's Ma
[38:36] and and uh what the what is in the book
[38:39] about yeah sure um well the title is a
[38:41] little bit clickbait but um okay um but
[38:45] um so maong uh Chinese uh revolutionary
[38:49] leader basically built um the communist
[38:53] China that we know today uh his portrait
[38:55] hangs above uh you know in Beijing in
[38:58] the highest Halls of power he's kind of
[39:00] like the scen as um almost like the
[39:02] father of modern China I guess you could
[39:04] say um China in the 20th century went
[39:07] through so many different changes like
[39:10] it went from uh dynasties that span like
[39:14] thousands of years to a short-lived
[39:17] Republic uh and then to a nationalist
[39:20] kind of um you could say like martial
[39:22] law state and then into a uh communist
[39:26] um dictatorship essentially uh but then
[39:29] even within that um after Ma's death um
[39:33] there is a new China kind of uh
[39:36] socialism with Chinese characteristics
[39:38] it's called um and that is the China of
[39:41] today of well you think like well isn't
[39:43] China a communist country but they're
[39:45] really into buying Bitcoin and they buy
[39:47] shares and they buy housing so how does
[39:49] that work right or like you know and um
[39:52] so the book kind of starts there
[39:55] actually might be surprising some people
[39:57] would say like well if you're doing a
[39:58] book on bitcoin and China shouldn't you
[40:00] start in like 20 2009 or 2008 but uh my
[40:04] book actually starts well it really
[40:06] really starts like thousands of years
[40:08] because like it just goes through like
[40:09] some of the Chinese monetary history not
[40:11] like a huge amount initially when I
[40:13] first wrote the book it was three
[40:15] chapters of Chinese history so you all
[40:18] bitcoiners who who read or write or or
[40:21] who who get that book uh got lucky
[40:23] because my editors have subsequently
[40:25] told me to remove like a lot of a lot of
[40:28] pages because I was I was almost getting
[40:29] to a point where it's like well where
[40:30] does this get to the Bitcoin right H now
[40:32] it's like a tight I think 20 Pages um
[40:36] but uh it really describes kind of like
[40:38] the span of like why Chinese people were
[40:41] so fascinated with Bitcoin in the first
[40:42] place because in order to understand
[40:44] that you have to understand a little bit
[40:45] of in China that's kind of where the
[40:47] first forms of credit money and paper
[40:49] money were
[40:50] invented um and that has led to in the
[40:53] past lots of significant political
[40:55] changes uh two of them uh for example
[40:59] one is the Y Dynasty if you all remember
[41:03] uh gangas Khan uh fun fact about him I
[41:06] think like 0o point something percent of
[41:09] all Asian males Trace his Heritage to to
[41:12] gangas Khan so it's a busy busy busy
[41:15] Mongol Emperor and created basically an
[41:18] Empire that spanned across the world and
[41:20] then the Yen uh Dynasty uh people might
[41:24] know in this context especially
[41:25] Europeans when Marco Polo VIs vised
[41:27] China that was during this uh Dynasty it
[41:30] was Kuan it was the Mongols kind of like
[41:33] ruling China um that was one of the most
[41:36] powerful Empires on Earth and it fell
[41:38] apart because they could not control the
[41:41] money supply at the end of the Reign I
[41:43] mean there were other reasons too but a
[41:45] large reason was because they couldn't
[41:46] control the money supply and actually uh
[41:49] we're talking about maong and Mao
[41:51] actually came to power partially because
[41:54] the Nationalist government at the time
[41:56] Chun Kai Sheek
[41:57] uh was seen as mismanaging the country's
[42:01] finances and so there was a lot of
[42:02] inflation there's a slide I usually
[42:05] present uh whenever I'm going on a tour
[42:08] and it shows this girl holding the
[42:10] equivalent of $10 Us in Chinese currency
[42:14] at the time right before ma went to
[42:16] power and uh it was
[42:19] 444,000 of those units so like you know
[42:23] obviously in the west people think about
[42:25] the wear Republic and they think about
[42:27] the wheelbarrows of money and China had
[42:29] a really similar experience with that
[42:31] and it helped uh you know Mone get power
[42:35] ultimately um so that's we start there
[42:39] and then it goes through the book really
[42:40] goes through like you know some
[42:42] perspectives from different ogs and
[42:44] different sources I interviewed like
[42:47] what happened how is it that China was
[42:49] able to create so many if you think
[42:50] about like bit main if you think about
[42:53] like binance you know if you think about
[42:56] uh all the mining pools that came out a
[42:59] pool F2 pool all those others like how
[43:01] did that all come about right and um
[43:04] it's an interesting thought um to think
[43:07] about um just even like you know again
[43:10] we're talking about adoption I make the
[43:11] argument that CH that Bitcoin really
[43:14] matured in China into like at least a
[43:17] little bit of a teenager because you're
[43:18] talking about like before that era of
[43:22] as6 right of uh mining ships specific to
[43:25] bitcoin you know you're talking about
[43:26] like people just like CPU mining you're
[43:28] talking about people GPU mining like
[43:30] it's kind of cool people are selling
[43:31] like back lavas for like you know 50 you
[43:34] know 50 Bitcoins for pizza all this
[43:36] other stuff you know all this really
[43:37] cool stuff but you know in China a
[43:40] generation of entrepreneurs they built
[43:42] like the first like custom mining chips
[43:44] they really built out like some of the
[43:46] mining pools some of the largest
[43:47] exchanges in the world especially after
[43:49] Mount gaau failed uh came about there so
[43:52] it kind of dives into like the history
[43:54] of it which is really the history of
[43:55] Bitcoin especially during that phase um
[43:59] and then also goes into like some of the
[44:02] motivations behind why people saw that
[44:04] way right uh you know money without the
[44:07] state being such a powerful idea kind of
[44:09] going back to the first chapter and then
[44:10] I would say the rest of the book really
[44:13] goes into um you know like why is the
[44:16] government ban Bitcoin why does the
[44:18] government think Bitcoin is such a
[44:20] threat um what is going on with the
[44:22] digital Yen which is kind of like the
[44:23] Central Bank digital currency that's a
[44:26] response to bitcoin
[44:27] um and what does that mean and towards
[44:30] the end of the chapter and I've been
[44:32] writing a lot about this recently for
[44:33] Forbes and Bitcoin magazine um but um
[44:37] well more for Forbes but um you know the
[44:40] idea is like what does that mean for
[44:42] like the
[44:43] global uh nation state kind of driven
[44:47] game theory around Bitcoin right because
[44:50] you have China is like a very strong
[44:52] like no to bitcoin camp and not only has
[44:56] it said no to Bitcoin it's proposed its
[44:58] own alternative solution which is the
[45:01] digital un and this idea that um you
[45:04] know countries should fight Bitcoin with
[45:07] uh their own digital currencies right so
[45:10] kind of talks about that a little bit um
[45:12] interestingly though I do think China
[45:14] well first it's like my hope is that you
[45:18] would understand three things after
[45:20] reading the book there's only three
[45:22] things that you understand one is
[45:24] hopefully a little bit about China um
[45:27] because as you mentioned Robin like a
[45:28] lot of bitcoiners may or may not know
[45:30] and I'm always trying to tell people
[45:31] like you know the more you study about
[45:33] other people's histories it's just a
[45:35] richer Corpus and View and uh Chinese
[45:38] monetary history super super fascinating
[45:40] because it's been through so many cycles
[45:43] and so you can kind of differently see
[45:45] the more iterations right so you know
[45:47] how like as bitcoiners we're so focused
[45:48] on inflation we're so focused on the
[45:50] political consequences of inflation
[45:52] right um and really with China you can
[45:55] see that play out over like longer
[45:57] Cycles right with the with like Western
[46:00] economic history you know maybe it
[46:03] starts like the nation state maybe
[46:05] starts in 1848 you know kind of thing
[46:07] and then you know the FED starts in like
[46:09] 1913 and like there's all these things
[46:11] like there's obvious been some Cycles
[46:14] but you can um you know like I was just
[46:16] reading something about how quantity
[46:18] theory of money was developed
[46:19] independently in China uh before fredman
[46:23] described it by some gap of like thou uh
[46:26] a few like at least a thousand and some
[46:28] years the reason why is because there
[46:30] was an idea of paper money and Fiat
[46:32] money much earlier in China than
[46:34] anywhere else so understanding China um
[46:37] and understanding any history is
[46:39] fascinating but I think understanding
[46:40] Chinese history can be really
[46:41] fascinating to politics and the finances
[46:43] the second thing I really want people to
[46:45] understand is why is there a Bottoms Up
[46:46] demand from Chinese people not the
[46:49] government but the Chinese people for
[46:52] Bitcoin like why do they want to get
[46:55] involved in bit coin why are they
[46:57] entrepreneurs building the next kind of
[46:59] great Bitcoin businesses why are they
[47:02] kind of doing that and and the honest
[47:03] answer is I think money and profit but
[47:06] uh in order to understand that you have
[47:08] to understand the first a little bit
[47:09] because you have to understand why China
[47:11] is incentivizing profit um and then the
[47:14] third uh is kind of like the top down
[47:17] like what why China as a nation state is
[47:19] so against Bitcoin right and a while ago
[47:22] I think you asked me this question I
[47:23] actually kind of missed it but you had
[47:25] asked um like you know with China's
[47:30] Bitcoin adoption I think like you know
[47:34] what is it about it or something like
[47:37] that that like the what like if the
[47:41] government is able to ban it um you know
[47:46] why is that been such an issue for
[47:49] adoption right um and I think what you
[47:53] see is that the government is able to
[47:55] turn the opinions of some people and is
[47:57] able to make it more difficult would
[48:00] attack Bitcoin that's the one thing
[48:02] about the Chinese party State like they
[48:04] do understand new technologies when I
[48:05] talked to Will from domus like they had
[48:08] damus taken down from the app store
[48:11] within like two or three days or
[48:12] something like that um but they also
[48:15] actually started attacking the default
[48:18] relays um they understood that those
[48:20] were like using
[48:22] websockets uh that had certain IP
[48:25] addresses and they put those behind the
[48:27] great firewall this is actually
[48:28] traditionally what they do uh for
[48:30] Technologies like Matrix and other
[48:32] things they also the Chinese party state
[48:35] has also banned tour and has employed
[48:37] very clever techniques in order to
[48:40] prevent people in China from using tour
[48:43] um and so you know you're talking about
[48:45] this like very sophisticated State
[48:47] that's able to do so much and different
[48:48] things and has definitely pulled some
[48:50] pretty significant punches in its
[48:52] ability I think any country that is
[48:54] looking to ban Bitcoin
[48:57] uh or harm Bitcoin is likely going to
[48:59] have something similar to China's path
[49:02] right they're look going to look at the
[49:03] fact that like most people use exchanges
[49:05] to to on board um you know you can
[49:08] attack one or two key points and then
[49:11] you you're able to kind of like Co-op
[49:13] the system or in the case of the United
[49:15] States or Canada you know you can you
[49:17] can have most of the funds go to ETFs
[49:20] and then you can have um you know it
[49:22] become custody coin or surveillance coin
[49:24] and then everybody else can use stable
[49:26] coins and Etc So that's its own
[49:27] different thing but um it's kind of like
[49:30] a playbook for countries and so uh what
[49:34] I always say the third thing I want
[49:36] people to leave with is like the top-
[49:38] down View and why that matters like
[49:40] first because China is trying to propose
[49:42] an alternative model that non-bitcoin
[49:45] falling countries uh can kind of lay out
[49:48] like they can create their own Central
[49:49] Bank digital currency they can put
[49:51] restrictions on cryptocurrencies stuff
[49:52] like that I believe there will be some
[49:54] countries that will follow that example
[49:56] but
[49:57] um I think that uh all three combined
[50:01] together allow you to really understand
[50:04] the history the bottoms up and top down
[50:07] why Bitcoin is such an enduring force
[50:09] and why Bitcoin um is able to grow at
[50:13] the rate it's growing I've never felt
[50:15] more bullish and ironically that's been
[50:18] like even though I've talked to like
[50:19] people who are like the most or some of
[50:22] the most repressed when it comes to
[50:23] bitcoin and that's what gives me hope
[50:25] like I meet people who are in in China
[50:27] or who have been to China several times
[50:29] and or who uh grew up in China and
[50:32] they're doing their University uh abroad
[50:34] and stuff like that and to see even
[50:36] those like four or five kind of kernels
[50:38] of Hope of like yeah I'm really into
[50:41] Bitcoin I don't want to use we Chad pay
[50:42] anymore it's like privacy invading
[50:44] things like that that that has made me
[50:47] uh bullish Beyond like price level and
[50:49] sentiment just like it is the right
[50:51] thing to be doing if that makes sense
[50:54] even if things don't turn out completely
[50:56] right right as says or has said I love
[51:00] that a lot it's it's it's so great to to
[51:03] hear that story and it's also so great
[51:05] to finally have this on the podcast
[51:07] where we have this uh reality of what
[51:09] what actually happens in in China and
[51:11] why it is like that which brings me to
[51:14] to my kind of last topic I really want
[51:16] to get into with you today is is the
[51:18] broader nation state uh Game Theory
[51:21] adoption standpoint um where it's
[51:24] interesting we have China really um
[51:29] let's say cracking down on it uh and
[51:32] then we have the US where potentially on
[51:36] Tuesday um uh the next president is
[51:39] someone who has a lot of bitcoiners
[51:41] supposed bitcoiners on
[51:44] there on on on his tickets uh and he's
[51:49] speaking quite good about it and he made
[51:51] a big change like five years ago Donald
[51:53] Trump he spoke really badly about
[51:55] Bitcoin and crypto General uh and now he
[51:58] speaks good about it I don't know how
[52:00] much he understands it probably like 2%
[52:02] of it uh but he understands it so he
[52:06] understands that there's a huge
[52:08] community that he needs to win an
[52:11] election and that in itself is really
[52:13] powerful so where do you see this uh and
[52:16] then we have the ECP then not don't
[52:18] don't let's not forget the Europeans
[52:21] that say that Bitcoin is going to 10
[52:23] million so that's why we should tax it
[52:25] and we should ban it
[52:27] that's that's what I got out of that
[52:29] paper I don't know what you got out of
[52:31] that paper uh but yeah like how do you
[52:33] see the current uh nation state adoption
[52:36] and and the status of that yeah actually
[52:39] um so you you had asked a really concise
[52:42] question that I missed that I'll tie
[52:44] into this point um which is uh where um
[52:48] how do I see Bitcoin changing China oh
[52:50] yeah I forgot about that yeah true yeah
[52:52] that's like they took me don't worry I I
[52:54] also forgot about it it took me a few I
[52:56] was like I I thought you had asked a
[52:59] really good question I was going to get
[53:00] to and then but I'll tie that into this
[53:02] because I think it it it does play a
[53:04] role um into this um so people ask me
[53:09] and they're always like well um so I'll
[53:11] give you an example of like when I did
[53:13] like real um journalism on the ground in
[53:17] Hong Kong so initially when the Hong
[53:19] Kong protests were going on I was kind
[53:22] of and you never should really do this
[53:24] um but I was like hm wouldn't it be like
[53:27] a really clean and simple story to be
[53:29] like oh a lot of people are protesting
[53:31] in Hong Kong against the system so that
[53:34] might lead to an openness in Bitcoin
[53:36] right and there were some signs of that
[53:39] like for example people refused to use
[53:41] digital kind of travel cards because
[53:44] there's an awareness that the police
[53:45] were surveilling that and one of the
[53:48] parts of the protest were that they were
[53:50] protesting the system economically there
[53:52] were almost like separate economies in
[53:54] Hong Kong it was really interesting they
[53:55] had this thing called Pro yellow and
[53:58] kind of like Pro blue and pro blue meant
[54:00] you supported the police and pro yellow
[54:03] meant you supported the protesters and
[54:05] the pro Yellow Block kind of had their
[54:07] own businesses and they had their own
[54:09] transaction economy and if you were like
[54:12] you know supporting the police you
[54:13] wouldn't go to these restaurants that
[54:15] had like a pro yellow side on it and if
[54:17] you were supporting the protesters you
[54:18] wouldn't go to you know the police
[54:20] restaurants and things like that right
[54:22] there are also people who are trying to
[54:24] get away from the Hong Kong dollar by
[54:26] saying that like you know a vote against
[54:27] the Hong Kong dollar is a vote against
[54:29] the system we no longer have faith and
[54:32] confidence um the Hong Kong protest
[54:34] mostly started because uh Hong kongers
[54:36] felt like they weren't getting universal
[54:37] suffrage they weren't getting the
[54:39] ability to be able to vote for their
[54:40] leaders
[54:41] fully the the reasons why are very
[54:43] complex and like not necessarily super
[54:45] suited for this podcast but I encourage
[54:47] people to do their own research if they
[54:49] want on this one country two systems
[54:51] basic law universal suffrage 2019 2014
[54:55] Hong Kong protests and the Hong 47 those
[54:57] are all keywords I would use if you were
[54:59] looking into that kind of stuff um but
[55:02] uh the thing that's been really
[55:04] interesting with that is when I went I
[55:07] was like you know like hey is there like
[55:09] more Bitcoin demand because you you see
[55:10] all these people like peeling away from
[55:12] the government right so like and uh that
[55:15] was like kind of like the first thing I
[55:17] kind of understood is like it's not that
[55:20] clean and simple so first I I I emailed
[55:23] like the ATM providers I was like has
[55:25] there been more demand for Bitcoin from
[55:27] the ATMs and they're like no you idiot
[55:30] everybody's protesting there's like
[55:33] nobody who's like coming to our ATMs
[55:36] because they're all busy like they're
[55:38] shoving the streets full of like you
[55:40] know like they're all protesting so I'm
[55:42] like oh okay interesting then I talked
[55:45] to some of the exchanges and I'm like
[55:47] well do you see like a Bitcoin premium
[55:50] and like yeah like I I did end up
[55:52] writing an article about that like some
[55:53] people saw like a little bit of a bump
[55:56] there's like a little bit of a premium
[55:57] for the Hong Kong dollar versus like
[55:59] other places so might that be like a
[56:02] sign that like you know some Hong
[56:04] kongers were interested in hedging away
[56:06] in Bitcoin um but it was very small and
[56:08] there was a lot of like back and forth
[56:10] on that and then I was like well maybe
[56:12] some Hong Kong groups use Bitcoin um and
[56:16] the thing about that is like they don't
[56:18] tend to now there was this Outlet called
[56:21] Hong Kong free press and they used to
[56:22] take Bitcoin through a BTC pay server
[56:24] but they've now since switched to using
[56:27] Brave uh or bat to raise funds um I'm
[56:31] not actually too sure why they made that
[56:32] switch but um in general what I've heard
[56:35] is uh for Hong Kong groups that are
[56:38] already
[56:40] risking themselves they don't they see
[56:43] Bitcoin as like an additional
[56:44] complication like if you're already
[56:46] doing things things that are might be
[56:47] illegal according to Hong Kong
[56:49] laws uh why add potential money
[56:53] laundering charges as well this is
[56:54] despite the fact that in Hong Kong HSBC
[56:57] proactively froze accounts of people
[56:59] belonging to protesters right so you
[57:02] think this is like a perfect melstrom of
[57:04] Bitcoin adoption factors like if I heard
[57:06] about all these things I would go run
[57:08] and try to find Bitcoin as soon as
[57:10] possible as well right um but it just
[57:13] wasn't as uh clean as that and and to me
[57:17] that experience informed my answer of
[57:19] like you know how will Bitcoin change
[57:24] China because people probably
[57:28] think or I've had some people
[57:31] say uh I'm not saying me but you know
[57:34] there's always people who are like the
[57:35] Chinese Communist party will fall will
[57:38] fail uh because of this and that um
[57:41] Bitcoin will play some kind of role in
[57:43] that um I think first of all I'm not one
[57:47] of those people that predicts the CCP
[57:48] will fail like any given time um I think
[57:51] it's like the same thing is trying to
[57:53] predict with ceranity
[57:56] uh and I know a lot of people in Bitcoin
[57:58] including people on your show have like
[58:00] very accurate technical analysis of
[58:02] where bitcoin's price will be that's not
[58:04] I I respect those people that's not me I
[58:07] don't I don't understand that I don't
[58:08] think I can really understand when the
[58:10] CCP will fail the example I always bring
[58:11] to people is like think about Iran
[58:14] Iran's government is so much more weaker
[58:17] from like an economic standpoint they
[58:19] have to import all these different
[58:21] things like um you know Israel just hit
[58:24] their missile Manufacturing things they
[58:26] import from China right they're
[58:28] sanctioned by so many different places
[58:31] like they Persona n grada they have like
[58:35] enemies all over the place like the
[58:38] Western block Israel everywhere um but
[58:41] still Iran since 1979 has been ruled by
[58:45] the mulas right has been ruled by uh the
[58:49] Umi and you know anyways whatever that's
[58:52] like going off a little bit of tangent
[58:53] but my point is that
[58:57] um that that's a much weaker government
[59:01] for which you could make the argument
[59:03] that Iran you know if you look at it
[59:05] from like an economic perspective if you
[59:07] look at it from just how interconnected
[59:09] they are if you look at it from like
[59:10] even just like how much threat they are
[59:13] probably under right probably would have
[59:16] folded you know think about the
[59:18] inflation in the Rael as well right
[59:20] think about like the average uh income
[59:22] of the Iranian people and things like
[59:25] that but it still hasn't it's found a
[59:27] way to persist and survive still to this
[59:30] day so I say like you know to people and
[59:34] and modern day China Dena Ping's China
[59:37] has about the same uh birth span is as
[59:41] that year I might have gotten it don't
[59:43] quote me but I think the Iranian
[59:44] Revolution is 1979 but um D sha ping um
[59:48] and his reform and opening up period
[59:50] actually really started during
[59:52] 1978 um but the Chinese Communist party
[59:55] is much much stronger than Iran right
[59:58] just as an example like economically
[60:00] speaking they have a ton of foreign
[60:01] reserves they're not as sanctioned um
[60:04] there's a lot larger population and the
[60:06] population has over the last 30 or 40
[60:09] years seen like uh relative economic
[60:12] growth although not like to the degree
[60:15] of like matching a Taiwan or anything
[60:17] like that yet right so just very
[60:21] difficult to tell if or when the CC CP
[60:26] will change whether that's like internal
[60:29] politics or whether it's external I
[60:31] think currently the Assumption has to be
[60:33] that they're going to be around at least
[60:35] for a while I think um and with Xi
[60:38] Jinping in power and unprecedented he
[60:42] he's the current Paramount leader of
[60:44] China um and he is holding power for
[60:47] another term so it's going to be him for
[60:49] another five years at least right until
[60:52] 2029 um and so there's not necessarily
[60:57] going to be like that much change in
[60:58] that regard but what I always tell
[61:01] people is that Bitcoin it's not a simple
[61:04] narrative it's not like I don't like the
[61:08] Chinese party State and what it does and
[61:10] so therefore I will use Bitcoin as a
[61:13] protest Vote or I will go on Noster and
[61:16] post about tanaman Square now there are
[61:19] some people like that and it is cool to
[61:21] see that uh there is a risk that people
[61:24] are taking but if you go on Noster for
[61:27] example you do see one or two people
[61:29] they post about whistleblowers they post
[61:31] about tanaman Square I don't discount
[61:33] these things it's very cool to see it
[61:36] and if you are in the mainland and you
[61:38] are making these statements you are
[61:39] taking a risk and that has to be
[61:42] acknowledged um but it's not like
[61:45] there's this like mass movement if that
[61:48] makes sense you know what I'm saying
[61:49] like even like there's not really
[61:52] Bitcoin meetups or anything like that in
[61:54] a public sense there's not really like
[61:55] conferences or events for people that
[61:57] for people to get together so there
[61:59] isn't this sense of like you know for
[62:01] example in the west or in Europe or
[62:03] things like that you can organize kind
[62:04] of openly right and you can say like hey
[62:07] like we believe in these kind of things
[62:08] you might even have Pro Bitcoin
[62:10] candidates uh like you had in the French
[62:12] elections right
[62:13] before but in China you don't have these
[62:17] things but but Bitcoin hits right at the
[62:21] Crux of the Chinese Communist party's
[62:23] biggest weakness which is it allows
[62:27] people since the CCP since
[62:30] 1978 has pursued a path of its glorious
[62:34] to get rich doesn't matter if it's a
[62:36] black or a white cat as long as it
[62:38] catches mice it's a good cat that's
[62:39] denelle Ping's quotes right he was the
[62:42] leader uh in that period of time who
[62:45] changed China from being a communist
[62:47] country to a communist country with
[62:51] stock markets right since then there's
[62:54] been this radical change so Chinese
[62:56] people no longer it's it's Heaven has to
[62:59] be delivered on Earth if that makes
[63:01] sense if I don't see it if I can't eat
[63:03] it right now then that's not worth
[63:05] talking about cuz when Ma ruled it was
[63:08] always like we are preparing our society
[63:11] for heaven so there's a little bit of
[63:14] you know there's also propaganda about
[63:16] how bad things were how good things were
[63:17] but you know millions of people starv
[63:19] and things like that right with modern
[63:21] in China you know you don't necessarily
[63:24] have that and now people can make money
[63:27] they can make money and they can be
[63:29] comfortable and they can buy housing and
[63:31] they can really upgrade themselves um
[63:34] you know not only just in China but like
[63:37] across the world what I what I've heard
[63:39] talking to Chinese people is that
[63:41] they're quite prideful of like even the
[63:45] smaller things like for example if they
[63:47] travel with a Chinese passport they now
[63:49] feel more respected because China as a
[63:51] country is more economically wealthy but
[63:54] the thing is that the the party State
[63:57] the Chinese Communist Party says you
[63:59] only had that wealth because of us and
[64:02] you're only going to keep that wealth if
[64:04] you save it within the Chinese system so
[64:06] there's the capital controls right so
[64:08] you're only allowed to exit $50,000 USD
[64:11] a year per person that's been relaxed a
[64:13] little bit for some expats and depending
[64:16] on what area of uh China you live in so
[64:18] it's not like absolutely firm anymore
[64:20] and there have always been exceptions to
[64:22] that but in general the idea is that the
[64:24] Chinese Communist party has always
[64:26] played this balance of like we need the
[64:28] Chinese people to be
[64:30] entrepreneurial like Bitcoin miners like
[64:32] Bitcoin exchanges and stuff like that
[64:34] but we need to
[64:35] control where their efforts go and we
[64:38] need to control where that money and
[64:41] savings go so if you think about China's
[64:43] story it really is a story of savings
[64:46] China's savings rate is structurally one
[64:48] the highest in the world and as a result
[64:50] their Bank Reserves so their M2 to GDP
[64:54] ratio which is kind of a way of
[64:55] measuring uh broader bank money compared
[64:59] to GDP is one of the highest if not the
[65:01] highest I believe Hong Kong and China
[65:03] are the highest M2 gdps in the world um
[65:05] and that's just a combination of people
[65:07] can only really save in the domestic
[65:09] system and they can only really buy
[65:10] domestic assets but what if you go and
[65:13] you say there is this asset that lies
[65:17] outside the system that has none of
[65:19] these restrictions so you can choose to
[65:21] spend and save your money wherever you
[65:23] want and now you live in a country where
[65:25] that is almost like the central Faith
[65:29] you know in China now they called it
[65:30] like the spiritual void because there's
[65:33] all kinds of things are trying to fill
[65:34] that there's people who are saying we
[65:35] should hearken back to the kusian days
[65:38] there's this and that there's a lot of
[65:39] worry about that actually because I
[65:41] think there's some discourse about how
[65:42] in Chinese society it's become All About
[65:44] The Money ironically right like that's
[65:47] the one thing I think that I've come to
[65:49] appreciate being in China talking with
[65:51] Chinese people people really want to
[65:54] make bucks in a way that I don't think
[65:57] like you know how sometimes it's like
[65:58] the European mind cannot comprehend or
[66:00] the American mind like the Western mind
[66:02] cannot comprehend how hustle Chinese
[66:05] entrepreneurs are like just cannot
[66:08] comprehend it it's a combination of like
[66:10] you know like being a generation I think
[66:13] this is my hypothesis it's like a
[66:14] generation of being away from you know
[66:18] absolute poverty and like also just like
[66:21] a cultural like people are like because
[66:24] wealth is so important people are like
[66:27] out for each other right um so this is
[66:31] the central value of China today the
[66:33] central value of China today is how
[66:35] wealthy you are people look down upon
[66:37] other people because they don't wear
[66:40] Louis Vuitton or things like that this
[66:42] happens outside of China too I'm not
[66:44] saying like for everyone obviously there
[66:46] are exceptions people with you know
[66:49] different beliefs and stuff like that
[66:50] but in general that gist is there well
[66:54] then Bitcoin is a superior form ter of
[66:56] saving your wealth and it gets rid of
[66:59] all these
[67:00] restrictions and um you know it's really
[67:02] appealing and by using Bitcoin you're
[67:05] exiting the system that's the thing the
[67:06] Chinese Communist Party fears the most
[67:08] because it needs to control that system
[67:10] of capital flight um because if too much
[67:13] Capital leaves at once then China's
[67:16] whole system kind of starts buckling
[67:18] under a little bit like it doesn't
[67:19] really work unless you are able to give
[67:23] uh cheap loans to to Chinese state-owned
[67:27] companies you can only get that if
[67:29] Chinese people are forced to save within
[67:31] China right so that's kind of on that
[67:34] front now um nation state adoption I
[67:37] know sorry this is like a really long
[67:38] tangent but nation state adoption I
[67:41] think just based off of that um what
[67:43] I've told people is like I based off of
[67:44] what I just said I think it'd be very
[67:47] surprising um like if you had two
[67:49] takeaways from what I just said one
[67:51] China's probably not going to change
[67:52] political leadership in that sense two
[67:54] if Bitcoin does does have role to play
[67:58] it's already doing that but not in a
[68:00] like Revolution like let's make a
[68:02] Revolution by Bitcoin but more just like
[68:05] Bitcoin is the revolution if that makes
[68:07] sense um like it's something the
[68:09] government doesn't want you to do but
[68:10] people will do anyways because it'll
[68:12] make them assets return so China the
[68:16] country you're not going to hear you're
[68:18] going to hear positive headlines but
[68:20] you're not going to hear um
[68:23] substantiative changes that might not
[68:25] matter for bitcoin's price for example
[68:27] um a couple of Chinese policy people
[68:30] including a former Vice Minister of
[68:32] Finance said something along lines of
[68:34] well we might have made a mistake and
[68:37] Trump is talking about cryptocurrencies
[68:38] now in Bitcoin we should probably study
[68:40] it right ultimately at the end of the
[68:43] day if China changes its stance on like
[68:45] the digital un and Bitcoin I think
[68:47] that's very unlikely but um you're
[68:50] likely going to see a lot of like really
[68:52] positive headlines because Trump is
[68:55] talking about Bitcoin now no matter what
[68:58] my opinions about Trump are and I have a
[69:00] lot um you know I I every time I post
[69:04] about him I make it a point to also post
[69:07] that he fundraised through World
[69:08] Financial Liberty just like I always I
[69:12] don't I don't ever have an article that
[69:15] goes by without me mentioning that like
[69:17] I never
[69:18] say what anyways he has his policies
[69:21] that he's
[69:22] proposed you know politicians they say a
[69:26] big game we'll see whether or not they
[69:27] actually act accordingly same thing with
[69:30] Trump um but the fact that he is talking
[69:33] about Bitcoin and I guess for him he
[69:35] does say crypto quite a lot you know but
[69:38] the fact that he's talking about Bitcoin
[69:40] I think is important to that kind of you
[69:43] know like it's not going to change
[69:44] China's path but for countries that are
[69:47] kind of like set on that Chinese path it
[69:50] might make them doubt kind of where it's
[69:53] going the one thing it unquestionably
[69:55] probably does is that it changes the
[69:57] Western block to be more stable coin
[70:00] oriented um I wonder how this is going
[70:02] to play out with Europe because I know
[70:04] the ECB is a pretty big fan of the
[70:06] digital Euro and as you talked about
[70:08] they just released the paper um although
[70:11] one thing I will say is because I've
[70:13] suffered from this a little bit you know
[70:14] like I'm like a payon of Forbes no I'm
[70:16] kidding but like you know like I'm a
[70:17] Content writer of Forbes and people are
[70:19] like Forbes as said and you got to be
[70:21] careful sometimes like for example The
[70:22] Economist I I did notice his kind of um
[70:26] I forget his name but his profile says
[70:28] like his views are strictly his and not
[70:30] those of the ecbs necessarily like you
[70:32] don't yeah I just I think yug sha I
[70:36] think is his name yugan sha yeah yeah
[70:38] and I don't disagree that it's probably
[70:41] how the ECB is thinking about it or it's
[70:44] or it's symptomatic or close to but you
[70:46] know sometimes um because at the end of
[70:49] the day it's like kind of like the the
[70:50] governing board that matters like
[70:52] Kristen lagard or something like that
[70:54] like it's not necessar their analysts
[70:56] that might be symptomatic but it's not
[70:58] necessarily you know so it remains to be
[70:59] seen kind of how Europe deals with this
[71:01] but I think uh with Trump uh there's a
[71:04] lot of big movement towards stable
[71:06] coins a lot a lot of big movement
[71:08] towards stable coins I I I actually
[71:10] think that's going to be bitcoin's
[71:11] biggest challenge at least in the
[71:13] western block is like how to separate
[71:17] itself from stable coins or where it
[71:19] makes sense and where it doesn't and
[71:21] you're seeing this play out in like
[71:22] really interesting ways I think like so
[71:24] for example from a regulatory standpoint
[71:26] like Canada just recently said it's not
[71:28] going to release a central bank digital
[71:29] currency it's probably going to use
[71:32] stable coins similar to the States you
[71:34] know the states um is trying to pass a
[71:37] stable coin act um to regulate and
[71:41] they've already like the judicial
[71:43] authorities already work with tether to
[71:44] a certain degree I think that in the
[71:47] nation state adoption kind of
[71:49] game um I mean RS to see if Trump
[71:52] actually you know gets Bitcoin
[71:55] um going through um and actually commits
[71:58] and does the Bitcoin Reserve I think
[72:00] that will make a
[72:01] difference um but I also think that from
[72:04] a policy standpoint the central because
[72:06] the central banks operate separately
[72:08] from the
[72:09] presidency in a sense it it almost
[72:12] doesn't really matter how the president
[72:15] thinks it's like the academic unless
[72:18] Trump appoints someone totally out of
[72:21] left field for J Powell
[72:25] um a central Banker is still a central
[72:27] Banker do you know what I'm saying like
[72:28] they're not they're not necessarily
[72:31] going to be like that much different in
[72:33] that view so I I do think you know
[72:35] there's things that leaders can do as
[72:38] kind of like from the federal side but
[72:41] then there's like just the entrenched
[72:43] interests of like Central bankers and
[72:45] just the way they think and I don't
[72:47] think that will necessarily change I
[72:48] think the people in the western block
[72:50] will probably look at stable coins and
[72:52] lastly I wrote about this like I think
[72:54] you're going to start seeing Bottoms Up
[72:56] adoption and you're going to see
[72:58] countries you know we're all trying to
[73:00] figure out Maya I interviewed her for
[73:04] Forbes really briefly like if she's
[73:05] going to be the next you know what's the
[73:07] next country that's going to adopt
[73:09] Bitcoin as legal tender there's like a
[73:11] couple candidates you know there's been
[73:12] a Mexican Senator that's been proposing
[73:15] that law um there may be Argentina
[73:18] although it seems like Malay is more
[73:20] focused on uh or he hasn't committed to
[73:23] his promise to freely use the US dollar
[73:26] yet so that's also difficult to see 100%
[73:30] or maybe it's something like surname if
[73:32] depending on you know all the variables
[73:34] I don't I don't actually even ever after
[73:36] having interviewed her I think she's
[73:37] great I think she's a great person but I
[73:40] I don't honestly know enough about Cy's
[73:42] political process to understand if she
[73:44] has a realistic chance of being the next
[73:46] president right I've been told some
[73:48] things I think it would be really good
[73:52] for Bitcoin for her to be in that seat
[73:55] um but that's what I I think you're
[73:57] going to start to see you're going to
[73:58] see like the the countries of the world
[74:00] kind of split off a little bit and some
[74:02] of them are going to use like the
[74:04] cbdcs uh and some of them are going to
[74:06] use like interestingly I think Russia is
[74:08] actually using Bitcoin or they're trying
[74:10] to use Bitcoin mining because I think
[74:11] they're like an energy Surplus state so
[74:13] they're playing Bitcoin in a sense of
[74:16] accumulating an energy Surplus and
[74:17] turning it into a more acceptable
[74:20] currency because normally what they
[74:22] would do is they would mine they would
[74:24] take their oil or whatever they would
[74:27] take their Surplus energy they would
[74:28] sell it for the US dollar but they're
[74:30] trying to uh change that right so it's
[74:34] been interesting to see them kind of do
[74:36] Bitcoin mining um but I think by and
[74:40] large there's going to be a block of
[74:41] countries that are going to be more on
[74:42] the China path the Central Bank digital
[74:44] currencies interacting with each other
[74:47] and prominent among those is like Saudi
[74:48] Arabia and United ARA remits which have
[74:50] already signed up to a pilot program
[74:52] along with the bank of Thailand and the
[74:54] Hong Kong monetary authority to work
[74:56] with China on an inter Central Bank
[74:58] digital currency Bridge um I think
[75:01] you're going to see in the west like
[75:03] States will support uh stable coins
[75:05] because they're buying up so much of the
[75:06] debt and then I think stable coins are
[75:09] going to be an interesting thing that
[75:11] will not be like competitive with
[75:12] Bitcoin but it's kind of like the next
[75:14] anchor right and then you're going to
[75:17] see some countries uh aggressively
[75:20] Embrace uh Bitcoin I think with the
[75:24] Strategic Reserve or they mine it
[75:26] themselves uh but I think those
[75:27] countries are slowly getting on board
[75:31] right now and what I think that Playbook
[75:33] looks like is like any energy Surplus
[75:35] country will start to have a incentive
[75:37] to mine Bitcoin so you see Bhutan
[75:40] Ethiopia and other places and I think
[75:42] that's going to continue it may be overt
[75:44] or not overt like Bhutan didn't announce
[75:46] the fact that they M so much Bitcoin
[75:48] until like very recently right um and
[75:51] then you might see also this idea of
[75:54] like Bitcoin strategic reserve and then
[75:56] like the Bitcoin legal tender but that
[75:58] will probably be much slower um My Hope
[76:01] Is that there's a few countries that
[76:03] come online at the same
[76:05] time so meaning um like what you really
[76:09] need for it to work like where Bitcoin
[76:11] doesn't play right now is between
[76:14] different countries that are
[76:15] systematically important in Global
[76:17] Supply chains so what you see now is you
[76:20] see the US buying oil and now you're
[76:23] starting to see the Chinese by oil with
[76:26] digital Yen that started to happen as
[76:29] early as last year in
[76:31] 2023 um when you start seeing nation
[76:34] states kind of use Bitcoin to get on
[76:37] that St to to trade with each other I
[76:39] think that's going to be another another
[76:41] meaningful pivot um but it's it's going
[76:43] to be like a weird space because there's
[76:45] so much I think the younger generation
[76:47] of like Bitcoin only politicians it's
[76:49] like a bet on whether or not those
[76:52] people get to power first
[76:55] versus the top down but the top down
[76:58] like the older people that are kind of
[77:00] like Donald Trump using Bitcoin to get
[77:02] contributions and things like that I
[77:04] don't think they really RFK was like I
[77:07] think the only exception I've seen it's
[77:09] like an older Generation guy who like
[77:11] really really got into the nuances of
[77:14] like Bitcoin and specifically Bitcoin
[77:16] only and I don't know that happen for
[77:19] the rest and even he attended other
[77:21] conferences like he was on on on crypto
[77:24] conferences block conferences but he I
[77:25] think he really um either has someone
[77:30] behind him who really briefs him
[77:32] perfectly well he actually went ahead
[77:34] and did a did a really good deep deep
[77:37] dive like his speech um uh was written
[77:41] so good at the Bitcoin National
[77:43] Conference like he really hit all the
[77:45] points that Bitcoin has want to hear
[77:47] imagine Donald Trump would have given
[77:50] RFK speech that would have been a
[77:53] massive massive thing
[77:55] uh like that that that was like that
[77:58] would have been the Home Run and would
[78:01] probably have made some uh some big
[78:04] waves but yeah as a president um maybe
[78:07] also cannot speak as maybe someone just
[78:12] like in a member of administration also
[78:15] have empathy for that but yeah it's it's
[78:17] it's fun to see um as a European I I
[78:20] don't care too much about American
[78:22] politics but it feels like it has an
[78:23] impact on bitcoin I don't know if it
[78:25] actually has one uh long term but yeah I
[78:29] definitely watch uh right now American
[78:31] politics more than Austrian politics and
[78:33] European politics so that that's
[78:35] fascinating also for me uh but yeah uh
[78:38] really cool I I love the topic like
[78:40] honestly like it's it's it's such a
[78:42] fascinating thing and I'm just like
[78:43] sitting here and and learning from you
[78:45] it's it's uh it's a great honor for me
[78:48] to to learn so much uh through this
[78:50] process we already at 1 hour 20 minutes
[78:53] I usually try to keep it at 1 hour but
[78:55] sometimes it's just too interesting for
[78:56] that thank for that I thought I thought
[78:59] yeah my bad my bad for that no no like I
[79:02] honestly like it like uh uh if if it's
[79:06] if it's longer than one hour it usually
[79:08] has a sign that it was so interesting
[79:10] that I like really want to hear more
[79:12] about it uh so I I I like it a lot
[79:15] really cool um we have an end routine in
[79:17] the podcast before I have a question
[79:20] that every one of my guests gets um what
[79:23] can we learn from you bes besides
[79:25] Bitcoin and maybe uh besides all the
[79:27] things that we already talked about
[79:29] today um yeah it's a good one um I knew
[79:32] you asked this but then I didn't really
[79:34] prep an answer for it um so uh what I
[79:36] would say is uh what I what I try to
[79:39] tell other people is like to um
[79:42] obviously we talked a lot about China so
[79:44] I'm not going to say like learn China
[79:45] but what I will say is um I learned
[79:48] quite a few different languages I grew
[79:50] up with French I grew up with Spanish
[79:52] and I know there's a lot of people who
[79:54] say
[79:55] um eventually you uh are not going to
[79:58] need any of this because AI will come
[80:00] and teach you all these languages or
[80:02] will come and translate for you
[80:04] perfectly but what I found is like when
[80:07] you read in the original Source like
[80:09] language and you are able to have
[80:11] conversations with people kind of in
[80:12] their native language you get uh access
[80:15] to a lot more um insights and feelings
[80:19] rather than kind of like programmatic I
[80:21] feel like that's that's like if there's
[80:23] one thing I would you know hopefully
[80:25] people can learn from me is just like
[80:28] being curious and and being open to just
[80:31] like spanning across multiple cultures
[80:34] is um key to finding things that you
[80:36] might not otherwise find absolutely
[80:39] really really cool um I I was like I my
[80:43] second language is English I'm still
[80:46] struggling with that uh but yeah it's
[80:48] like I I have German and English but I'm
[80:51] really bad with languages actually it
[80:53] took me a long while while to even get
[80:55] English down and English is a relatively
[80:58] easy language compared to some other
[81:00] languages uh so yeah it was was I'm not
[81:04] a language guy but I really wanted to
[81:06] dive deep in other languages especially
[81:08] also because my girlfriend is speaking
[81:10] Hindi uh this is something that I I
[81:13] probably should get going a little bit
[81:15] better uh but yeah languages are really
[81:19] I think it's it's more about now
[81:21] learning the culture with with the
[81:23] language uh uh then actually having a
[81:25] language skill as you said the language
[81:27] skill itself is getting less and less
[81:29] important with with technology but it's
[81:32] so much uh you learn a lot about the
[81:34] culture also I love that a lot yeah
[81:36] perfect we have an end in the podcast
[81:38] where the previous guest is asking a
[81:39] question for the next guest without
[81:41] knowing who the next guest actually is
[81:43] and uh this could be a whole not podcast
[81:47] question uh but let's see what what you
[81:50] say say about it how do you envision the
[81:53] future Solutions of layer two
[81:55] technologies so basically how do we
[81:57] scale
[82:02] Bitcoin um yeah and then I have to also
[82:05] come up with something like this but
[82:06] okay I probably should have watched the
[82:08] last one um yeah I have a lot of
[82:09] thoughts about this actually which could
[82:11] in of itself be its own podcast but to
[82:14] be like kind of short and concise
[82:17] um yeah I mean um I think that uh there
[82:22] I was just recently at Bitcoin Plus+ uh
[82:24] talking about ecash and all those
[82:26] different things in Arc um I think that
[82:30] right now lightning um needs to be I I
[82:34] think that the use case right now seems
[82:37] to be like very we seem to be in this
[82:39] world of like the next billion seems to
[82:41] be like really into stable coins and
[82:43] really into like trading between
[82:45] different tokens and stuff like that so
[82:47] when you look at like for example
[82:48] lightning right their latest release tap
[82:50] rot assets is kind of a reflection of
[82:52] this I think um I would like to see a
[82:57] world where people get paid more in
[83:00] Bitcoin I think that would solve a lot
[83:02] of different problems and then um you
[83:05] know you have I'm not an a I I think
[83:08] like the l2s like they have the
[83:10] advantage of not being as easily aifi
[83:15] right um because the l2s can be like a
[83:17] lot more experimental they move a lot
[83:19] quicker for example liquid I mean that's
[83:21] just to give a hypothetical example they
[83:22] just release Simplicity right that's
[83:24] like its own thing I have my own opinion
[83:26] about that it's a more Turin complete
[83:28] programming language but the fact is
[83:30] that l2s can move faster um than Bas
[83:33] layer can um I think that um lightning
[83:38] specifically the two areas that I think
[83:41] are the most important to solve for for
[83:43] scalability one is uh how do you get the
[83:46] non-custodial uh how do you get the
[83:48] custo um the the self- custody
[83:51] experience up to the level that you need
[83:53] it to be for lightning to be like fully
[83:56] or not maybe even not fully I mean
[83:58] there's always going to be a role for
[83:59] lightning service providers but um to
[84:02] more self- custody right so like how do
[84:05] you create that experience um I think
[84:08] that there's a lot of focus with Arc for
[84:10] example on like how you can collapse
[84:12] that into
[84:14] utxos um and how you can reduce the fee
[84:17] rate for doing that um but I also think
[84:20] another thing that's really important is
[84:21] just even like how do you get people to
[84:24] that level where they're running their
[84:25] own node right um so that's kind of like
[84:30] how I think about l2s but I have my own
[84:31] different thought I'm like an L2 expert
[84:33] but I just kind of like riffing off that
[84:35] question um it's a good thing I know
[84:37] something about
[84:39] Bitcoin yeah it's it's it's super
[84:41] interesting also for me because uh like
[84:44] I actually get paid in in Bitcoin uh not
[84:47] all of it because I I get paid from
[84:49] different sources uh but all my Bitcoin
[84:53] sponsors uh uh pay me in Bitcoin so so
[84:56] it's been a whole new experience setting
[84:59] this up uh how do we receive payments
[85:01] how do we do that uh it it's is it's
[85:05] really uh you get to know the technology
[85:08] in a different way so that really helps
[85:11] also like um to to develop those things
[85:14] because then you use those Technologies
[85:16] this gives then the Technologies bit
[85:18] more funds to work with this funds more
[85:20] development so it's it's slowly but
[85:23] honestly I'm suris surprised how how
[85:26] well we already have those medium of
[85:28] exchange Technologies because Bitcoin
[85:30] right now is in the store of value
[85:32] adoption phase and we already seeing a
[85:34] lot of adoption the medium exchange so
[85:37] it's it's quite I feel like when I came
[85:40] into 202 with Bitcoin um I made myself
[85:44] like some expectation okay where is
[85:46] Bitcoin in five years where is Bitcoin
[85:47] in 10 years and honestly it it
[85:49] completely blew up my expectation like
[85:51] it it went way better than than I
[85:53] thought and this had El Salvador on the
[85:55] radar I didn't have definitely not a US
[85:59] Presidential uh candidate talking about
[86:01] it and like even talking about it I
[86:03] hadn't on on my radar so that the the
[86:07] developments I feel like it's it's
[86:08] really good but yeah um let's let's
[86:11] conclude uh thank you so much for for
[86:13] being on uh Roger um before I let you go
[86:16] before uh that where can people find you
[86:19] ask your questions read more about you
[86:21] read your your contributions
[86:24] yeah let me uh get it out of focus and
[86:27] into Focus this is the book would mold
[86:29] Bitcoin and so uh they can people can
[86:32] find this on Amazon or Bitcoin magazine
[86:34] um if they want to pay in Bitcoin
[86:36] Bitcoin magazine um and then there's
[86:38] always Amazon available Amazon does have
[86:40] like an ebook version so I think that's
[86:41] like easier for some people um I'm also
[86:44] doing events um so I'm going to be
[86:45] speaking at adopting Bitcoin I'm going
[86:47] to be at satcom uh and I'm going to be
[86:49] at the African Bitcoin conference um
[86:51] probably going to be like next year when
[86:53] all the because the circuit kind of dies
[86:55] for the next three months I think or
[86:57] there might be some events but between
[86:59] December to April doesn't feel like
[87:01] there's a ton of events but uh you know
[87:03] probably we'll do everything back up
[87:05] when it gets back up and people can find
[87:07] me on X at Roger H1 1991
[87:11] unfortunately my birth year because I'm
[87:13] so obsc 10,000 um and uh Noster as well
[87:18] uh lowy uh no- verify.com um
[87:24] yeah that's my np5 um but otherwise yeah

[87:30] you just look up like my name Roger hang
[87:33] Forbes you'll find uh my latest really
[87:36] cool perfect then I see you in in two
[87:38] weeks at adopting Bitcoin and Salvador I
[87:41] will also be there yeah I saw you just
[87:43] got added so I was like oh yeah Robin's
[87:45] gonna be there uh that's cool yeah I
[87:48] actually G be yeah we can um I don't
[87:49] know if you're still recording but yeah
[87:51] like do did you want to talk like out
[87:54] side of the recording or oh no no uh um
[87:57] I I still didn't do my uh my my end
[88:00] routine okay
[88:03] okay uh but uh yeah like it's it's it's
[88:07] it's with some guest it flows the energy
[88:09] is so good that that like it never
[88:12] really ends and the podcast keeps going
[88:14] and and I I love that a lot but like I'm
[88:16] I'm like oh like at some point I should
[88:18] like end the thing but maybe I I turn
[88:21] into like a CH Rog format at some point
[88:24] I just like keep going for 4 hours I
[88:25] don't know uh right now I don't have the
[88:27] energy to talk four hours per day with a
[88:31] daily Bitcoin podcast like that that
[88:33] would be you got like amazing stamina
[88:35] like I'm doing this is like I do like I
[88:37] think like two or three media interviews
[88:39] like a week and I'm already like dead I
[88:42] have no idea how you're able to do like
[88:43] two like I've seen you do two in a day H
[88:47] yeah the day had also two uh actually
[88:50] most recording days I have two or three
[88:53] because I don't record on Sundays and I
[88:56] do take breaks so I do have to record
[89:00] when I record I usually record two or
[89:02] three uh in really rare cases four but
[89:05] that's that's uh too much uh and it
[89:08] fries your brain and the last one is
[89:10] just not as good as it is three I kind
[89:12] of can like three is good two is perfect
[89:15] uh because yeah two like there's no
[89:18] problem with that at all uh the the
[89:21] previous one was also long with one and
[89:22] a half hours so I'm like today three
[89:24] hours of podcast recording and yeah my
[89:27] my brain feels good my brain feels fine
[89:29] I hope I hope it's not just for me I
[89:32] hope it also uh you you noticed that I'm
[89:35] not fried I don't know hope no you're
[89:37] good you're good you're good yeah I see
[89:38] you chugging the big uh Stein of like
[89:41] water I'm like wow it's a very very
[89:42] Austrian thing to do that that is that
[89:45] that is the the thing that keeps me
[89:47] going like just like liters of water
[89:49] every day it's not vka so like there's
[89:52] actually just water in there
[89:54] I was vka that' be even more impressive
[89:56] but um no I mean uh yeah yeah but oh
[89:59] that's that's also something I should
[90:00] bring to people like yeah drink water
[90:02] water is important absolutely perfect
[90:04] then let's conclude thank you so much
