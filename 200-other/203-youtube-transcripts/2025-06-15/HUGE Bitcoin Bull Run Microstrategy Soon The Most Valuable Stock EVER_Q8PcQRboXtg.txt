[00:00] let's talk about micro strategy today I
[00:01] can see mstr going to 800 within 12
[00:04] months easier than I can see Bitcoin
[00:06] going to 200,000 but if the United
[00:08] States comes out and says we're buying
[00:10] 200,000 Bitcoin a year over 5 years I'm
[00:12] pretty sure that the rest of the world
[00:13] goes oh [ __ ] we need to buy as much as
[00:15] we can too micro strategy is taking
[00:17] their Legos building models of these
[00:19] things and then casting molds from those
[00:20] models and then selling the mold giving
[00:22] those to Wall Street here you play with
[00:24] those while they're keeping their
[00:25] Bitcoin and they're able to produce more
[00:26] of these molds and do more with the more
[00:28] Lego bricks that they have but they
[00:29] never lose their Lego bricks there are
[00:31] people that got into mstr because they
[00:33] thought hey this seems like a good idea
[00:35] I like what sailor is doing and they got
[00:36] into mstr and here they are having made
[00:39] a ton of money the date that I'm looking
[00:41] forward to is 2032 that having I think
[00:43] is the most significant one at that
[00:45] point 99% of all Bitcoin has been mine
[00:48] and then also that's the first time that
[00:50] the subsidy goes below even one Bitcoin
[00:53] you can self custody Bitcoin and you
[00:55] can't with mstr I can sell I can move I
[00:58] can do whatever I want Bitcoin is a bar
[01:00] asset msdr is not I believe that msdr is
[01:02] going to go a whole lot higher and I
[01:03] also believe that it is not for me to
[01:05] invest do you think micr strategy has a
[01:07] chance of being the biggest company on
[01:09] Earth
[01:09] [Music]
[01:13] sure let's talk about micro strategy
[01:16] today right yeah so I guess there's
[01:21] there's a lot to unpack here and I got
[01:22] to start out by saying that there's a
[01:26] lot of nuance with micro strategy that I
[01:28] don't understand and what I mean by that
[01:31] is all of the options and all the
[01:34] various like when you talk about the the
[01:37] real like I don't know how much you've
[01:38] watched of punter Jeff or these True
[01:40] North guys the Rory Quant and all them
[01:44] they they talk about this stuff daily
[01:46] either on Twitter or they do live calls
[01:48] they've got a Discord where they're
[01:49] talking about this stuff all the time I
[01:51] don't really know how much you can talk
[01:53] about once you kind of get it um but
[01:56] hell people seem to find all sorts of
[01:58] things to talk about when it comes to
[01:59] big coin or Finance
[02:01] constantly but I think for most people
[02:05] like um some of my co-workers some
[02:07] Boomer types that they want to find an
[02:10] investment that is going
[02:13] to at least break even with inflation
[02:15] ideally do a little bit better and then
[02:17] just call it a day so they can go on and
[02:19] do other things with their life which I
[02:21] think is honestly the best way to go
[02:23] about things if you're sitting there in
[02:24] save a demon a lot of people have talked
[02:26] about this that you shouldn't have to
[02:27] have a second job to research all of
[02:29] these
[02:30] things
[02:33] and so okay before I say get into any of
[02:38] of that stuff I want to start by saying
[02:40] that where micro strategy is at right
[02:43] now is not due to some like sailor said
[02:47] this himself I'm I'm not saying anything
[02:48] controversial here but where they're at
[02:51] is due
[02:52] to in in a sense luck and that that's
[02:55] what I want to point to with this well
[02:58] it's not what the whole thing sorry I
[02:59] just woke cup so but it's going to take
[03:01] a little time for my brain to get going
[03:02] here but luck plays a very big role in
[03:05] how the world
[03:08] works so Bitcoin does play a big role in
[03:11] where micro strategy is at right now
[03:13] there's no denying that that that is
[03:14] 100% for sure but why micro strategy and
[03:18] sailor found Bitcoin is out of
[03:22] desperation and sailor has said this
[03:24] numerous times it's not like they they
[03:26] had known about Bitcoin for a long time
[03:28] were like H let's weigh our options and
[03:30] look at all these different things it
[03:31] was sort of like we have a a company
[03:33] that's just kind of on its last legs
[03:35] here it's on life support you can look
[03:36] at the chart and you can see back at the
[03:39] dotc bubble they Spike they you see this
[03:41] massive Spike that goes up to I don't
[03:43] know what the share price at the time
[03:45] was but it's huge and I think it was the
[03:47] year 2000 and then it craters within
[03:50] days a month it just goes nose diving
[03:52] down and then it stays pretty much flat
[03:54] for about 20 years 22 years all the way
[03:57] until they find Bitcoin and the whole
[04:00] reason that sailor found Bitcoin is well
[04:02] he had a friend I think his name is Eric
[04:04] Weiss I think who was down in Florida
[04:06] talking to him about Bitcoin like hey
[04:07] have you looked at this thing it seemed
[04:09] like I I don't know that their Eric guy
[04:13] was saying you should put your whole
[04:14] company's balance sheet on this thing I
[04:16] think it was more like have you seen
[04:18] this thing I think it might be a decent
[04:20] investment much the way that you might
[04:21] talk to a friend to be like hey have you
[04:24] have you thought about property I know
[04:25] you've got x amount of dollars have you
[04:27] have you thought about buying an
[04:28] apartment building or a second home or
[04:30] or something like a a vacation rental
[04:32] air being being being it out have you
[04:34] thought about putting it into this have
[04:35] you thought about doing that so it was a
[04:36] similar type thing and then sailor looks
[04:38] into it deeply and goes maybe maybe I
[04:41] should buy a lot I think he's told his
[04:43] friend is like I bought a I don't know
[04:45] it was some sizable chunks like I bought
[04:47] $100,000 worth or something like that or
[04:49] or a thousand coins I don't know it was
[04:51] some something where the guy was like
[04:53] okay I I thought you might just dip your
[04:55] toe in I wasn't expecting you to do that
[04:57] but the whole reason that micro strategy
[04:58] found Bitcoin
[05:00] yes his friend but
[05:04] was their company was D it wasn't dying
[05:06] it was just
[05:08] existing
[05:10] and I have a a personal story that has
[05:13] nothing to do with Bitcoin I'm just
[05:14] going to say this real quick where I
[05:16] lived before where you and I recorded
[05:18] before where you were I don't know if
[05:20] that changed but where I was was a
[05:21] basement apartment that was about 450 ft
[05:23] where I'm in now I'm in an office well
[05:26] what I call my office of a home that is
[05:28] about four times as big and that has
[05:30] nothing to do with Bitcoin it's pure
[05:31] dumb luck it's because a family member
[05:35] had a home that was unoccupied and said
[05:37] hey do you want to live in this
[05:39] home okay sure so I'm paying I'm still
[05:42] paying rent but it's less than I was
[05:44] paying before and this has nothing to do
[05:45] with Bitcoin so I know a lot of people
[05:47] want to point to bitcoin be like oh
[05:48] Bitcoin fixes the world and in all these
[05:49] different ways and it does it does but
[05:52] we're not there yet and
[05:55] so there are times where people just get
[05:58] lucky and there are people that got into
[06:01] mstr because they thought hey this seems
[06:03] like a good idea I like what sailor is
[06:05] doing and they got into mstr and here
[06:08] they are having made a ton of money well
[06:12] that gets tricky because have you really
[06:13] made any money if you haven't realized
[06:16] anything like if you've got all these
[06:18] stocks and you're sitting on them you're
[06:19] like oh my goodness my my portfolio is
[06:21] up a th% 10,000% whatever it is if
[06:24] you're not actually doing anything with
[06:26] that money and it's just a number on a
[06:27] screen I like
[06:30] okay like if it hasn't changed your life
[06:33] in any way other than I guess you having
[06:36] some sort of sense of euphoria or a
[06:39] dopamine Rush when you check your your
[06:40] account I guess that's worth something I
[06:43] guess but if you're still eating Ramen
[06:46] and you're still live living in you know
[06:48] a cardboard box then I don't know so I
[06:52] wrote all these things down a bunch of
[06:54] notes here and I think that a large
[06:57] reason why people are
[07:00] struggling you see this on Twitter you
[07:01] see different clips like I don't
[07:03] understand why why micro strategy is
[07:05] trading at a a premium to nav and nav I
[07:09] didn't even realize this until thanks to
[07:10] British hudle and he explained I mean I
[07:12] could have looked it up I guess but it's
[07:13] net asset value and if a company is
[07:16] trading most companies do trade at a
[07:19] premium they're trading at a higher
[07:21] volume or being valued more than their
[07:24] net asset value the total valuation of
[07:28] apple right now was something like three
[07:30] trillion dollars I mean that's an insane
[07:32] number for Microsoft it's two something
[07:35] Google's two something these companies
[07:37] are have these valuations that are
[07:40] numbers
[07:41] that kind of make the head go ah it
[07:45] doesn't even really makes
[07:47] sense but the the net asset value of
[07:50] these companies is not trillions of
[07:52] dollars I don't know how much their
[07:54] Total Property is worth and all the
[07:58] computers that they've purchased and the
[08:00] fancy cars or even uh Apple's fancy dut
[08:04] headquarters that they've got out there
[08:05] in California that was billions of
[08:07] dollars which is a lot of money but it
[08:09] wasn't trillions of dollars wasn't
[08:12] trillions maybe maybe if you took into
[08:15] account all of every single phone that
[08:18] exists every piece of software every
[08:20] computer maybe you get to a trillion
[08:22] dollars I don't know a trillion dollar
[08:23] is a lot of money and then they're
[08:27] trading it three times that they're
[08:28] valued at that it's not because of the
[08:31] hard Goods that they have it's I don't
[08:33] know if I heard this somewhere or I I
[08:35] don't think I'm smart enough to have
[08:36] come up with this phrase but I I I
[08:39] encountered this phrase somewhere that
[08:41] the market trades on tomorrow's
[08:44] sentiment not today's truth so people
[08:48] are constantly well I think this
[08:50] company's going to go up in value so
[08:52] they buy it and so that that it's kind
[08:54] of self-fulfilling prophecy in in all
[08:56] aspects oh I think this company's not
[08:57] worth as much and the it might not just
[09:00] be I have a hunch it might be no this
[09:02] company is definitely going to Crater
[09:03] because of these different factors and
[09:05] we saw that very thing happened in in
[09:08] extreme form in the past few years
[09:10] during covid where oh my goodness look
[09:12] at pelaton the the exercise company all
[09:15] the PE everybody's going to be
[09:16] exercising in their home okay but for
[09:19] how long well that stock went flying
[09:21] Zoom went crazy because oh all these
[09:23] people are going to be doing things from
[09:25] home so all these companies started
[09:27] trading way way way higher than ever
[09:29] before because you had this
[09:30] concentration of stuff happening people
[09:32] were being concentrated into their homes
[09:34] and so things that benefited from people
[09:37] being stuck at home were doing really
[09:39] well oh let's let's invest in all these
[09:41] different things that have to do with
[09:42] that but then as soon as the world
[09:44] started opening up again and people like
[09:46] could go back to work or had to go back
[09:48] to work then you're not exercising on
[09:50] your your fancy bike anymore you're not
[09:52] using taking Zoom calls as much as you
[09:54] were anymore and these companies start
[09:55] going down in
[09:57] value well
[09:59] something that's been talked about in
[10:01] the bit oh my goodness there's a hair on
[10:03] my mic in the Bitcoin space for a while
[10:06] is that we live in kind of a a wacky
[10:09] town a a a
[10:12] funny an incorrect version of reality
[10:16] but the the example of a tape measure
[10:17] has been used a lot of times like oh
[10:19] Fiat is a is an inaccurate tape measure
[10:22] it doesn't it doesn't show us the truth
[10:24] it's the numbers change on the
[10:26] day-to-day because well it depends on
[10:28] what country you're you're using your
[10:30] tapee measure in but maybe it's
[10:31] inflating at this amount or maybe in a
[10:33] different place it's inflating at this
[10:34] amount or maybe it's started to slow
[10:37] down maybe there's even a moment of
[10:38] deflation maybe maybe the numbers shrunk
[10:40] for a moment it's in constant flux it's
[10:43] not it's not
[10:46] static so the image I'm just going to go
[10:49] in order
[10:50] here uh oh right on that note a lot of
[10:56] people that whole idea is so ingrained
[10:59] everything that we do that people don't
[11:01] even question why we get raises it it's
[11:05] it's weird people just you assume that
[11:06] you get a raise it's in movies and stuff
[11:08] like oh honey I got a raise let's go on
[11:09] or I got a big bonus at the my yearend
[11:11] bonus was was twice as much as I thought
[11:13] it was going to do I I knew we'd been
[11:15] doing well but but Mr Smithers didn't
[11:17] tell us how well we were doing and so
[11:18] let's go on vacation or whatever oh wow
[11:21] that's great but nobody thinks about
[11:23] like why is that why why do you need
[11:26] more money I've worked the retail jobs
[11:28] that's been my day job since I was in my
[11:31] teens and I I think from what I can
[11:34] recall at every single job I've had the
[11:36] goal from one month to the next month is
[11:39] to
[11:40] do about 10% better than you did the
[11:44] previous year so if it's January 2024
[11:46] you want to do 10% better than you did
[11:48] in 23 which you wanted to do in 23 20
[11:50] better than 22 and so on and so forth
[11:52] barring some sort of strange events or
[11:56] World up like crazy wackiness
[12:00] but I've never heard anybody ever before
[12:04] Bitcoin say well why why do we want 10%
[12:08] growth it just sounds like oh you just
[12:10] do because you want more money well yeah
[12:12] but why do why do you want more money
[12:14] what do you mean why do you want more
[12:15] money you want more money because
[12:17] obviously okay and if you even start to
[12:20] ask that question you're you're you're
[12:22] questioning the whole fabric of the way
[12:26] everything works and PE that that gets
[12:29] really weird for some people I think it
[12:31] it almost gets to a like a psychedelic
[12:33] trip type thing like whoa whoa we don't
[12:35] want to question what the final turtle
[12:37] is standing on will we just have to
[12:39] assume that it's Turtle all the way down
[12:41] like just go with that like that doesn't
[12:44] make sense well it has to because that's
[12:46] the way it's been working but what if it
[12:48] doesn't have to work that way okay
[12:50] you're you're you're just doing crazy
[12:51] talking now Jeff Booth and others have
[12:53] talked about this it's hard if not
[12:56] impossible to see a new option from
[12:59] within where you're at right now a lot
[13:02] of people in relationships get stuck
[13:04] like this they they think oh because I'm
[13:07] with this person that it has to be this
[13:09] way and they they can't imagine themsel
[13:12] with somebody else or or even without
[13:14] this current person even if this
[13:16] person's really bad to them they're
[13:17] abusive or maybe not even abusive
[13:19] they're just not a great person it's not
[13:21] a good fit but but they're comfortable
[13:24] they've been with this I I've often
[13:25] wondered how many relationships end up
[13:28] as a Rel relationship just because like
[13:32] they they both worked at Taco Bell and
[13:35] they hung out a few times and they drank
[13:36] together maybe they smoked weed a few
[13:38] times and oh they got a little uh a
[13:41] little tipsy and they started making out
[13:43] and now we're going out and I guess
[13:46] we're a couple now and we both work the
[13:49] the graveyard shift to Taco Bell and
[13:51] yeah it ain't great but but we're
[13:55] together
[13:56] um it's definitely a big I
[13:59] think what I think it's definitely a lot
[14:03] of relationships go like that I I even
[14:05] see it in my invironment sometimes like
[14:08] yeah why I'm together with that just
[14:10] because I don't want to go to the
[14:12] trouble of searching a new one it's
[14:15] like it's hard to find things like to to
[14:18] know what you want is difficult you know
[14:20] like this is what I want I you have a
[14:23] clear definition of what it is that you
[14:24] want and then go seeking that thing like
[14:26] even mstr with it the bringing it back
[14:29] to that with the genius that sailor
[14:31] is he he knew what the problem was but
[14:34] he didn't know where to find a solution
[14:36] the solution kind of fell into his lap
[14:37] via his friend via this other thing this
[14:39] outside thing it's not as though he went
[14:42] searching for Bitcoin specifically is
[14:44] sort of like hey this thing exists and I
[14:47] imagine he
[14:49] like I I haven't heard of a single
[14:51] person that heard of Bitcoin and it just
[14:53] clicked and they had no questions like
[14:55] yep sure I'm I'm in that that great
[14:57] wonderful that I'm done no do you want
[14:59] to know how it works I don't care it it
[15:01] sounds perfect I don't need to listen to
[15:03] a podcast I don't need to read a book I
[15:05] have no questions I'm going to put 99%
[15:08] of my net worth into it right
[15:10] now okay I don't know who that person is
[15:13] that most people don't do that unless
[15:15] your net worth is like $5 like I have
[15:18] nothing to lose here I'll just why not
[15:21] sure let's see what happens but but but
[15:23] we might end up at that place like if if
[15:26] Bitcoin is really widely adopted and
[15:28] it's just like a such a no prer and
[15:30] everyone is talking like if if Bitcoin
[15:33] is at that boring place where the store
[15:34] of value is just so proven and it's just
[15:37] like it's such a high level where your
[15:39] grandma gives your your the kids advice
[15:42] like a yeah here some Bitcoin keep it
[15:45] like don't sell those like that that
[15:48] Grant my advice if you come to that
[15:49] point uh may maybe then at the same
[15:54] probably similar to how people now put
[15:57] all their wealth into Fiat and they have
[16:00] no clue about finances because if they
[16:01] had the clue about Finance they would
[16:03] not put all the money in in fat and but
[16:05] yeah most people don't have even any
[16:08] Investments then most of them have bad
[16:11] Investments but that's another story
[16:13] even at least they have Investments so
[16:16] maybe at that point so so a lot of
[16:18] people don't don't ask those questions I
[16:20] feel like yeah I think you're 100% right
[16:24] that in in years time that people will
[16:26] just they'll see what's happening with
[16:29] their money and I think it'll be a while
[16:32] yet I don't know how long but I think
[16:34] it'll be some years before people start
[16:35] to understand what inflation is I I and
[16:38] I don't even know that the masses will I
[16:40] I think it's like so many different
[16:43] fields most people don't understand I
[16:46] certainly don't how the internet works I
[16:48] know that if I turn on my
[16:50] computer signals happen data flows
[16:53] through wires to different places and I
[16:57] I'm able to talk to you in a completely
[16:59] part of the world but I couldn't break
[17:00] it down in detail and be like oh well
[17:02] this is exactly what's happening and I I
[17:05] I I don't even know what I don't know to
[17:07] say what I don't know like I I can't sit
[17:09] here and explain how it all works
[17:11] because I I don't I don't know what I'm
[17:12] talking about I can't tell you how
[17:14] elon's rockets work like there most
[17:17] things I don't know about I that's true
[17:20] of most people you have to pick some
[17:23] items that you can focus on and do your
[17:26] best within that area and and then just
[17:29] kind of let everything else happen I we
[17:33] we trust so many of our systems to other
[17:37] people and be like well I hope the
[17:39] electricians and the plumbers and the
[17:40] construction workers know what the hell
[17:42] they're doing because I sure [ __ ]
[17:44] don't I just had a power outage that
[17:46] lasted 36 hours and I it like if it was
[17:50] up to me it's like well Dell we need you
[17:51] to go and fix it I wouldn't even have a
[17:53] clue where to begin like I I I guess
[17:56] I'll just go and look for a tree just
[17:58] randomly drive down roads and hope that
[18:00] I find like a sparking wire like oh that
[18:03] seems to be the the clear problem there
[18:05] now what do I do about it I don't know I
[18:07] guess I'll try and get some sticks and
[18:09] put the wires together or something like
[18:11] I I have I have no idea what I'm doing
[18:13] here I mean if it was up to me to fix
[18:15] the grid we'd be screwed like well we
[18:16] don't have power anymore like that's
[18:18] just the end of that like that was fun
[18:20] was a fun ride having electricity but we
[18:23] don't
[18:24] anymore yeah it's the it's the same uh
[18:27] way when when you drive a car and
[18:29] there's some problem and there's
[18:30] something going on and then you like
[18:31] turn to the road and then you open the
[18:34] the the front trunk and you just try to
[18:37] like you have no clue about anything at
[18:38] least I don't have and you just still
[18:40] open it to see like there's some such
[18:43] like an obvious problem that everybody
[18:45] can see it and you're like oh yeah yeah
[18:47] there's the plus and minus and then I
[18:49] have to connect them back like there's a
[18:51] cable disconnector something really
[18:53] obvious but yeah it's not like that it's
[18:55] even like even the things you do every
[18:57] day I for example do the every day and
[18:59] yesterday I had the problem where
[19:01] microphone was not working I still don't
[19:04] know why but I needed 30 minutes to fix
[19:07] it how did I fix it I deinstalled all
[19:10] all the software I used for it and
[19:12] reinstalled it problem fixed still don't
[19:15] know why the problem
[19:17] existed but I think that's where we kind
[19:20] of end up was with Bitcoin where a small
[19:23] minority actually knows why Bitcoin is
[19:26] valuable and and why and how Bitcoin
[19:28] works and all the applications and
[19:29] there's like an industry around that
[19:31] that then provides all the applications
[19:34] but the masses don't care they just want
[19:36] to see the purchasing power go up that
[19:38] that's all they will care about the same
[19:40] way like nobody cares how WhatsApp Works
[19:42] they just like to see the tick that the
[19:44] other message the other person got the
[19:46] message that that's no proof that's just
[19:48] like a pixel but they see it as proof
[19:50] the same way with Bitcoin I think long
[19:52] term yeah yeah and I think it it's it's
[19:56] either going it's going to be one of two
[19:58] things and people have said this I mean
[19:59] I'm just saying this the same thing that
[20:02] most people the masses will get into
[20:03] Bitcoin because like sailor they they
[20:06] realize oh my goodness I'm just getting
[20:08] poor every year I mean I felt this in a
[20:11] way that I that I could not have
[20:13] articulated years ago and I think many
[20:15] people do where they they just notice
[20:17] that things continually get more
[20:19] expensive like you look back and you I
[20:21] mean you hear this all the time like oh
[20:23] I remember back in my day I I was able
[20:25] to rent an apartment for x amount of
[20:27] dollars and now man did you know that
[20:29] same building just sold for X millions
[20:32] of dollars I had a room in that
[20:34] apartment I had a a whole apartment to
[20:35] myself and it was $500 a month back in
[20:38] the 80s or whatever and now that that
[20:39] apartment sold for $5 million or you
[20:42] hear stories like that or I remember
[20:44] personally when I would go and help
[20:46] because I was homeschooled helping my my
[20:48] mother shop seeing packets of ramen
[20:50] these these Maruchan ramen packets that
[20:52] I mean really inexpensive and when they
[20:54] were on sale like the the the weekly
[20:57] special or whatever you could get 10
[20:59] packs for a dollar so they were 10 cents
[21:02] and now I think the cheapest that they
[21:04] are is like just under a dollar maybe if
[21:07] they're on an extreme sale like 80 cents
[21:10] or something like that maybe I think
[21:11] they're closer to a dollar and so I see
[21:13] that and go okay that's a very obvious
[21:16] sign like I distinctly remember them
[21:18] being 10 cents because my mom didn't
[21:21] usually like to get them it's not really
[21:22] good food but when they were that
[21:24] inexpensive I was like all right well
[21:26] it's some amount of sustenance and you
[21:27] really enjoy it so sure 10 cents is hard
[21:29] to hard to say no to it's not that much
[21:32] money even even then
[21:35] um so bringing this back back around to
[21:38] mstr I I think that mstr to to the long
[21:42] and short of it It's Tricky so I I I
[21:45] think that I understand what they're
[21:46] doing generally and I also think that
[21:50] what they're doing is worth
[21:53] drastically more than what they're
[21:55] currently valued at so I don't think
[21:58] that they're market cap should be the I
[22:00] don't know what it is right now 65 70
[22:02] billion that it's at I think it should
[22:05] be way way way higher I don't know how
[22:08] high I trillions I I do believe I mean I
[22:12] I think they they should be up there
[22:14] right next to Ms or um right next to
[22:17] Microsoft and the the big seven Nvidia
[22:19] Apple Google all of them and if somebody
[22:21] will ask why yeah okay so like 60 that's
[22:25] a market cap of like 81 uh billion okay
[22:29] and and just something that I want to
[22:31] because you mentioned it before where
[22:33] they like in in 2000 February March
[22:36] where they just like shot up like crazy
[22:38] and then took a really sharp dive and
[22:42] then they were really like almost flat
[22:44] obviously went up a little bit uh over
[22:47] that time but uh over 20 years uh f4x
[22:51] not bad but also not good like it's
[22:54] there are other stocks that went up
[22:55] crazy in that time um but then we kind
[22:59] of have that biggest comeback story of
[23:01] all time I feel like that like that
[23:03] that's crazy from that one alltime high
[23:05] to to the right now Tim High uh it's
[23:09] it's still 30% up it it's it's not
[23:11] significant but the people that there
[23:14] might be some person out there that
[23:15] bought micro strategy at the top in in
[23:18] 2000 and now seeing his position for the
[23:21] first time ever in the green I don't
[23:23] know water again
[23:26] yay I made it I made in 20 for years 30%
[23:29] of profit yeah yeah finally I beat you
[23:33] inflation I knew MSR was the best but I
[23:37] I think that that Spike on the far right
[23:39] there is going to be way way higher and
[23:42] the reason I think that is because I
[23:43] think one Spike represents a lie and I
[23:47] think the other Spike represents truth
[23:49] so this gets into the core of what I
[23:51] think about micro strategy so and this
[23:54] brings me back around to where I kind of
[23:56] started where we've heard people in the
[23:58] Bitcoin space talk about how oh the
[24:00] world has been
[24:02] operating the the monetary system has
[24:05] been I don't know if I would go so far
[24:07] as to say a lie because a lie requires
[24:10] conscious intent but it's certainly been
[24:13] not true we've been living in this kind
[24:16] of wacky town and the image that I like
[24:19] to to explain this is that imagine a
[24:22] city where all of the contractors are
[24:24] using these wacky Town tape measures
[24:27] there's there's one of two options if
[24:29] your tape measures are continually
[24:31] changing on you they're they're growing
[24:32] the numbers are moving further apart
[24:34] they're shifting it's all always moving
[24:36] there your your city is going to end up
[24:38] in one of two ways as far as I can tell
[24:40] it's going to end up good the way that
[24:43] we see most towns that that functions
[24:45] we've got structurally sound buildings
[24:46] things are working but there's a big big
[24:48] caveat to how that could happen or it
[24:51] looks like something out of a wackadoo
[24:53] cartoon Willy Wonka town where the
[24:55] windows are all misshapen and things are
[24:57] topsy Turvy and pipes go from huge to
[25:00] small it's just it's all crazy and
[25:02] things are constantly bursting I mean it
[25:05] really looks like a Caron world where
[25:07] things are breaking and the whack
[25:09] guy five dudes jump out of a tiny truck
[25:12] and they wrap it up with duct tape and
[25:14] they do a lot of shrugging to each other
[25:15] I guess that works and they go bumbling
[25:17] off well because we don't live in that
[25:20] world then how do we get the other world
[25:23] an inordinate amount of energy and time
[25:27] to combat the LIE now what this looks
[25:30] like as far as I can
[25:32] tell is heaps and heaps and heaps of
[25:36] money being thrown at something well
[25:37] give me an example of heaps and heaps of
[25:39] money being thrown at something Dell how
[25:41] about as I talked about earlier and
[25:43] sailor has pointed to all of these
[25:45] companies trading at massive like I I've
[25:48] got a number here that I think it was
[25:50] hodle said that um Google trades at 22
[25:54] times their net asset values I don't
[25:58] know how who who figured that out but
[26:00] you do a rough figure of all their
[26:01] properties and you get an estimate you
[26:03] go okay well they're they're if they're
[26:05] worth x billion or trillions of dollars
[26:08] and their total assets are dis billions
[26:10] of dollars then that they're trading at
[26:12] a 22 valuation I think Microsoft is it's
[26:15] 50 times apple or something like that
[26:17] it's way way way higher than that
[26:19] because people are throwing money at
[26:21] this these things because they think
[26:23] that it's worth this because of what
[26:26] they think that they'll do why it's
[26:28] trading so high I I doesn't really make
[26:30] a whole lot of sense to me I I don't get
[26:33] it but the base layer of what those
[26:36] companies are is their buildings but the
[26:41] the real base layer is is the people
[26:42] that they have they have tons and tons
[26:44] of people doing all these different
[26:45] things coming out with new products
[26:47] keeping the products that they have
[26:48] online micro strategy has a really small
[26:51] team I don't know how big their software
[26:54] side of things are but the the Bitcoin
[26:56] side of things I I've heard it's like a
[26:57] dozen people it you don't really need
[26:59] that many people to figure out how to do
[27:02] the whole Bitcoin treasury thing and
[27:04] then make products for Wall Street well
[27:06] back to the wacky Town thing if you have
[27:09] a a a general contracting company and
[27:13] you have to
[27:14] combat your wacka do tape measures
[27:17] you're going to be spending so many
[27:19] man-hour so many resources just to try
[27:22] and find truth so that you can build
[27:24] things and do things and not have this
[27:27] damn t measure continually lie to you or
[27:29] or accept that it lies to you and try
[27:31] and find some modum of reality within
[27:35] that Wackadoo world and then you see
[27:38] this other company come along and
[27:39] they've got 10 people to your 10,000
[27:41] people and every time they build a
[27:43] building it just works and they build
[27:45] another one it just works and for a
[27:46] little while you could say oh they're
[27:47] just getting lucky they're just getting
[27:48] crazy lucky and you could say that about
[27:50] micro strategy oh they're just getting
[27:51] crazy lucky oh they they they haven't
[27:54] they're not actually doing anything this
[27:56] or that well they they are
[27:58] they are you how do you look at them
[28:02] trading up there in the likes of the
[28:05] volume traded is right up there with
[28:07] Nvidia some of the biggest companies in
[28:08] the world when um sailor went through
[28:10] their entire earnings call here a couple
[28:14] three weeks ago whenever it was he was
[28:16] pointing out how they have pretty much
[28:18] blown every other company out of the
[28:19] water in terms of the amount that
[28:22] they're trading and they're they're
[28:24] trading right up there with the likes of
[28:26] Tesla and Nvidia and apple and whatnot
[28:28] which which is doesn't make any sense
[28:29] for a company that is a a small fraction
[28:32] until it does make sense because you
[28:33] realize oh their base
[28:36] layer is this immovable thing so if you
[28:41] if you're trying to move a boulder in
[28:44] your fulcrum the block of wood that
[28:45] you've got your pry bar stuck under or
[28:48] on top of rather and your your block of
[28:50] wood is sitting on cotton candy it's not
[28:53] it's not going to allow you to move that
[28:54] Boulder very well if another person next
[28:57] to you has got their fulcrum set on
[28:59] concrete they're going to be able to
[29:01] move that Boulder a hell of a lot easier
[29:03] but if your entire cotton candy
[29:06] Foundation requires thousands of
[29:08] thousands of people to come in there and
[29:09] just stuff cotton candy and you've got
[29:11] the cotton candy people and you've got
[29:12] the cotton candy man manufacturers and
[29:14] the machines to make the cotton candy
[29:15] and the whole infrastructure you're
[29:17] probably not going to question your your
[29:19] whole cotton candy mode of operation
[29:22] you're going to go well this works
[29:24] clearly we're able to move Boulder
[29:26] sometimes it it it works well enough to
[29:27] do that
[29:28] but you are going to start to wonder why
[29:30] the person over there using concrete as
[29:32] their base layer is able to do this a
[29:34] whole lot better this is where I run
[29:36] into the limits of my understanding on
[29:39] these things because somebody might go
[29:41] okay well give me an example of cotton
[29:42] candy versus concrete and I don't
[29:46] understand exactly how the markets work
[29:48] well enough to tell you like these
[29:49] options and all these different things
[29:51] to say well this is an example of cotton
[29:53] candy and this is an example of concrete
[29:55] except that
[29:58] Bitcoin doesn't move it doesn't change
[30:01] it is what it is and a side note it's so
[30:04] funny when people like if sailor bought
[30:06] 55,000 Bitcoin why didn't the price go
[30:10] up somebody had to
[30:14] sell that's the number one thing that
[30:16] happens when somebody buys something is
[30:18] somebody just had to sell it what do you
[30:19] mean why didn't the price go up it's
[30:22] when people don't sell that causes the
[30:24] price to go
[30:25] up if he bought it then that's an
[30:28] obvious indication that somebody sold
[30:30] like that or he stole it I don't think
[30:34] he stole 55,000 Bitcoin from somebody I
[30:38] I feel like that would have made news
[30:39] somewhere so hey I seem to be missing
[30:41] some Bitcoin I think this Michael sailor
[30:43] guy might have something to do with
[30:45] it but when you have back to the cotton
[30:49] candy thing so much money being thrown
[30:51] around on the market it and I mean Wall
[30:53] Street but other markets too but I
[30:56] believe that Wall Street is is the
[30:58] biggest of the financial
[31:00] markets it and then you have Micro
[31:03] strategy come along doing what I mean
[31:07] honestly whatever it is that they're
[31:09] doing but they they are offering
[31:11] products to to to Wall Street to make
[31:13] money it's going to look weird I imagine
[31:15] to most people especially that have been
[31:17] in the markets for a while like well
[31:18] this doesn't make any sense but it does
[31:21] to a bitcoiner they're just buying and
[31:23] holding Bitcoin and then offering
[31:24] products to Wall Street I actually
[31:29] sailor has said something a few times
[31:30] that I he's smart I'm not going to deny
[31:33] that I mean you you've talked to him
[31:34] he's a really smart guy and explain deep
[31:36] Concepts but I think that the example
[31:38] that he continually points to where he's
[31:40] at least pointed to a few times is a
[31:41] little bit not accurate so he he has
[31:45] likened what mstr is doing to what
[31:48] standard gas does I think it's standard
[31:50] gas Standard Oil where they take crude
[31:52] oil and they refine it and you've got
[31:54] asphalt and you've got and then you've
[31:55] got kerosene for airplane ' got all
[31:58] these different products okay that
[32:01] that's it's a decent analogy but the the
[32:03] problem that I have with that analogy is
[32:05] that most people can't use crude oil I I
[32:09] if somebody dropped a a 55 drum of air
[32:13] barrel off in my driveway like I don't
[32:15] know I don't know what to do this may
[32:16] maybe I can find somebody to sell it to
[32:18] I I don't I this is more of a nuisance
[32:21] than anything I I don't know what to do
[32:22] with this and I think that's the case
[32:24] for most people that they can't just use
[32:26] crude oil so his his analogy there that
[32:30] that's why I dislike it because most
[32:34] people even somebody that doesn't really
[32:36] know much about it can use Bitcoin even
[32:39] if all you do is sell it like it's
[32:41] really easy to sell if you have it on an
[32:43] exchange you can just press the sell
[32:44] button if it's on river or cash app or
[32:47] whever I I can't just sell crude I'd
[32:50] have to I don't I don't know what I
[32:52] would do I guess I'd call some auto part
[32:54] stores and just like I'd start the the
[32:56] search of what what do I do with this
[32:58] thing but I can do something with
[33:01] Bitcoin and so I think what they're
[33:04] doing is is less like standard gas and
[33:07] it's more like Lego so anybody can use
[33:10] Lego bricks maybe you're you're really
[33:13] good you can build really neat things
[33:14] but even even just a chimp can at least
[33:17] play with them there you can do
[33:19] something with your Lego bricks but I
[33:21] think what micro strategy is doing is
[33:23] they're taking their Lego bricks they're
[33:25] building models with these Lego bricks
[33:29] Wall Street is so funny because they
[33:31] don't really do anything I they don't
[33:33] they're not producing anything not not
[33:35] really it's not like oh Wall Street
[33:37] makes phones no they don't oh they they
[33:39] they produce train cars to move Goods
[33:41] across the country no they don't they
[33:43] just they're kind of like a bunch of
[33:45] degenerate gamblers that are it's like
[33:47] have you ever seen the movie Rat
[33:49] Race uh you mean the short movie like
[33:52] the 15 minutes where no no it's a
[33:54] fulllength movie it's it's about people
[33:56] racing across the country and it's a
[34:00] think it's got John with it okay it's it
[34:02] was A Goofy movies I think from the I
[34:04] don't know 2005 or something like that
[34:07] but there's John C is in it from Monty
[34:09] Python and a bunch of other stuff and
[34:11] he's part of if not the head of this
[34:13] whole group that is betting on this race
[34:15] and they're betting on yeah that movie
[34:18] when did it come out 2001 2001 yeah yeah
[34:22] so yeah John C is in it there's this
[34:24] group of degenerate gamblers and they
[34:26] they'll bet on
[34:28] anything anything like they they order
[34:32] room service at this hotel that they're
[34:34] staying at and they're like oh what do
[34:35] you what color is his shirt going to be
[34:38] and is is will the food be will the the
[34:41] butter be on the left side of the tray
[34:43] or be on the right side of the tray
[34:45] they're they're betting on anything and
[34:46] everything they're just throwing money
[34:48] down and betting on this and betting on
[34:50] that and that's how I view Wall Street
[34:52] they don't care what the businesses are
[34:56] they'll bet on anything like they'll
[34:57] leave the morals and the ethics to
[34:59] anybody else they'll they'll if they can
[35:01] profit off of pharmaceuticals which are
[35:03] currently killing people and mass
[35:05] doesn't matter I don't maybe the
[35:08] individuals maybe there are some
[35:09] individual investors that like whoa whoa
[35:11] I'm not going to invest in that company
[35:12] because I know from a friend that
[35:14] they're doing some really shady stuff or
[35:16] something like that maybe but I think
[35:19] even that person if he works for a firm
[35:21] and knows that that company's going to
[35:22] make millions of dollars and is the
[35:25] difference between his entire company
[35:26] getting a massive bonus or
[35:28] not probably probably is going to go
[35:31] through with the trade anyways and make
[35:33] a ton of money and I think that's how
[35:35] Wall Street generally works this is what
[35:37] you I mean in this country at least it's
[35:40] one of two from what I understand that
[35:42] we allow sorry there's this meme really
[35:45] it's a really funny one like there are
[35:47] two Wall Street um um guys coming
[35:50] together and they don't know what they
[35:52] are selling or buying they don't know
[35:53] which unit it even is they just know
[35:56] like I bought it at like like 48 and I
[35:58] sold it at 57 and they made a profit
[36:00] that's the only language they they
[36:02] really don't care what's the underlying
[36:04] thing or what's the unit of it they
[36:06] could even explain it they just care
[36:08] about the profit and I think that's
[36:10] really nicely showing what what wall
[36:12] stre actually get a B yeah yeah and
[36:15] that's that I mean you could have a
[36:17] whole debate about whether or not that's
[36:19] should exist or but you can't deny that
[36:21] it does and you can't go to New York and
[36:24] go to Wall Street and look around like
[36:25] well these are a bunch of poor people
[36:28] they don't have much money they don't
[36:29] know what they're talking about it's
[36:30] like going to Vegas this is so amusing
[36:32] the the biggest display of Vegas that
[36:35] you are going to lose your money is
[36:37] Vegas itself you just have to look
[36:39] around like take two seconds like this
[36:41] didn't get built because everybody is
[36:44] walking out of these casinos a
[36:47] winner this this is here because most
[36:50] people are losing money like like the
[36:53] vast majority you you are walking up
[36:55] against that it's like people walking up
[36:58] like like David walking up to a thousand
[37:01] goliaths and like yeah no I I can beat
[37:03] you like well okay may
[37:07] maybe maybe but usually no how do you
[37:11] know usually no who are you
[37:13] to look around look around open your
[37:17] eyes that's that's how I know usually
[37:20] no
[37:21] but what micro strategy is doing as far
[37:24] as I can tell is they're taking their
[37:26] Lego bricks and they're con constantly
[37:27] getting more they're not selling their
[37:29] Lego bricks so this is part another
[37:31] reason why sailor's example doesn't work
[37:33] is because they're not using the crude
[37:36] they're not when you use crude to refine
[37:38] it you lose the crude and you have to go
[37:40] and get more and you have to like you
[37:42] but with my example here they take the
[37:45] Lego bricks they build models from those
[37:48] those Lego bricks that they build
[37:49] different I don't know a farmhouse an
[37:51] animal a spaceship things that that Wall
[37:54] Street wants we for whatever reason they
[37:57] want these different things I don't know
[38:00] why it doesn't matter they're able to
[38:01] make money with these different things
[38:02] they bet on these different things they
[38:03] move them around they trade them they
[38:05] they they're they're like kids with
[38:06] Pokemon cards on the schoolyard like
[38:09] you've got a model ship you've got this
[38:10] so they're trading them and so micro
[38:12] strategy is taking their Legos their
[38:14] Bitcoin building models of these things
[38:17] and then casting molds from those models
[38:18] and then selling the molds giving those
[38:21] to Wall Street here you play with those
[38:22] while they're keeping their Bitcoin and
[38:24] they keep them coming up with more
[38:25] things and they're able to produce more
[38:27] of these molds and do more with the more
[38:29] Lego bricks that they have but they
[38:30] never lose their Lego bricks they never
[38:32] lose their crude oil they're just able
[38:34] to offer these products to Wall Street
[38:36] but as far as I can tell I don't think
[38:40] all of those products are available to
[38:42] the average
[38:44] consumer I I I think there's Ser some of
[38:46] them like some of their bonds and stuff
[38:48] I I'm not again like I said i' kind of
[38:51] at the limits of what I understand about
[38:52] these things and I listen to these
[38:54] podcasts with with Jeff and Rory Quant
[38:57] and grain of salt on these guys and I
[38:59] feel like I'm the dumb field worker out
[39:03] there listening to the scholars and I
[39:05] just hear Snippets of what they're
[39:06] saying they're they're around the
[39:08] campfire and they've got their charts
[39:09] and their their their books and they're
[39:11] going in they've got their robes and
[39:13] their huddled around speaking in some
[39:14] strange esoteric language and even
[39:16] though I I speak the same language as
[39:19] them I understand the words the the the
[39:22] context of the words don't make a whole
[39:24] lot of sense like my
[39:28] brother has done some of the option
[39:30] stuff and has done well for him but he's
[39:33] also taken a few small hits here and
[39:35] there he's had to buy his options or to
[39:37] resell his options I I I don't really
[39:39] get it because it does seem like to some
[39:43] degree gambling not quite the same but
[39:47] similar there that
[39:49] certainly it's a lot more like gambling
[39:51] than buying Bitcoin and just doing
[39:54] nothing just sitting on it and that's
[39:56] the part that I
[39:58] I dislike about that whole world is
[40:03] there's there's certainly some amount of
[40:06] time constraint that it takes to do this
[40:08] stuff and you might say oh no it only
[40:11] takes 10 minutes I log into my account I
[40:13] set this I do that I I've got these
[40:15] different parameters if it goes up to
[40:16] this amount it'll sell if it doesn't go
[40:18] to that amount it'll do this or that and
[40:20] it's 10 minutes later I like yeah is it
[40:22] really 10 minutes is it really are you
[40:24] you telling me that your your your brain
[40:26] is only on for that thing for 10 minutes
[40:28] of the day because I doubt it I bet
[40:30] you're checking the price I bet you're
[40:31] doing this you're logging back in I bet
[40:33] you're listening to podcasts about that
[40:35] what the best time is so I bet it's more
[40:36] like multiple hours every single day and
[40:39] certainly every week is that worth it to
[40:41] you is it fun like okay like I that if
[40:44] that has value right there for you I'm
[40:45] not going to tell you not to do it I'm
[40:47] not I'm not going to tell anybody not to
[40:48] do something unless it's illegal then
[40:50] you might not want to do it but in terms
[40:52] of the buying and trading stuff I okay I
[40:57] I I I guess have at it I made a a video
[40:59] about this recently and then one of the
[41:00] comments was oh well what should my my
[41:04] distribution be I I like mstr I like
[41:07] what they're doing and and I like what
[41:09] Bitcoin is I understand Bitcoin well
[41:11] enough I think I understand both these
[41:13] things how much should I be putting in
[41:15] if I've got a paycheck and I've got
[41:16] let's say $1,000 comes in and my
[41:18] expenses just keeping it simple as $500
[41:20] so I can invest each month $500 do I put
[41:24] $100 into micro strategy and and and the
[41:26] 400 into to mstr or is vice versa like
[41:29] what what is the breakdown there and I I
[41:33] I can't tell an in individual what to do
[41:35] but I came up with four categories do I
[41:38] still have it I
[41:39] don't I don't know I'll see if I can
[41:41] remember so the first category is if you
[41:44] have an employer that does some sort of
[41:46] 401k matching thing you put in this
[41:48] amount they'll put in that amount that
[41:50] seems like a really good opportunity to
[41:52] put it into mstr American hudle talked
[41:54] about his his wife who was a nurse
[41:56] practitioner
[41:57] he the whole reason that he got into
[41:59] mstr well he telling he wanted her to
[42:01] get into Bitcoin well there he couldn't
[42:03] there's no 401K that you can buy direct
[42:05] a Bitcoin and then take self custody of
[42:06] it like that that that's not a thing so
[42:08] he was trying to get into gbtc couldn't
[42:10] for some reason maybe I don't know
[42:13] whatever I think the the 401K was
[42:14] through Fidelity maybe they knew because
[42:16] they were going to launch their ETF they
[42:17] didn't want to touch dbtc I don't know
[42:18] what the reason was he couldn't so the
[42:20] next best thing was mstr he's like okay
[42:23] well they've got Bitcoin exposure so
[42:25] this is the closest I can get to owning
[42:27] Bitcoin it's mstr and so his wife went
[42:30] 100% in onto
[42:32] mstr with her 401k and is blown
[42:35] everybody else's 401K out of the water
[42:37] by orders of magnitude for obvious
[42:39] reasons because they've done so damn
[42:42] well so I think if you have an employer
[42:45] this is person type one that can do some
[42:47] sort of a match that seems like a good
[42:49] idea that like if you can't get Bitcoin
[42:51] and you can get free money because your
[42:53] employer is going to do a match that
[42:55] seems like a no-brainer to me the next
[42:58] type of person
[42:59] is you enjoy the trading stuff that's
[43:02] worth something to you you have some
[43:04] idea of what you're doing or you think
[43:06] you know what you're doing and you're
[43:07] able to make a profit you've you've got
[43:09] experience there maybe you do it for
[43:10] work and so you've got your own little
[43:12] side project that seems to be the case
[43:13] with Rory Quant and punter Jeff they
[43:15] work for different firms on Wall Street
[43:18] I think generally broadly speaking Wall
[43:20] Street and so they do this mstr thing on
[43:22] their own they've mentioned a few times
[43:24] that they've talked to their co-workers
[43:26] and employers like hey maybe we should
[43:29] allocate more and they're just going
[43:30] yeah maybe like okay well I'm doing
[43:32] really well look at my portfolio oh
[43:33] that's cute okay so that's the second
[43:37] type of person the third kind of person
[43:38] is and this is the one that I I kind of
[43:42] paus the most on to suggest but it does
[43:44] seem to me that in the short term like
[43:47] 12 to 24 months that there is a higher
[43:51] likelihood that mstr doubles like it
[43:55] seems more likely to me that in 12ish
[43:57] months mstr goes from the 400ish that
[43:59] they're at to 800 that Bitcoin going
[44:01] from the 90ish that it's at to 180 I can
[44:05] see mstr going to 800 within 12 months
[44:08] easier than I can see Bitcoin going to
[44:11] call it 200,000 now I can see a path for
[44:14] Bitcoin doing that very easily
[44:16] especially with Trump coming in and all
[44:18] of this talk of nation state adoption
[44:20] like things can change really really
[44:22] really fast and I've got another note on
[44:25] that that fast thing here in a second so
[44:28] if you need
[44:30] money and this is definitely not
[44:32] Financial advice but if you're thinking
[44:35] like hey I need this hip replacement and
[44:38] I need x amount of dollars you have a
[44:40] clear goal not just oh I want more money
[44:43] to have more money no no no no like you
[44:44] have a clear need for this money you
[44:47] know that this hip hip has to be done on
[44:50] this day like it's the day for the the
[44:53] surgery is I February 2nd 2026 so I need
[44:58] to have the funds before then to pay for
[45:01] this massive surgery and if I don't have
[45:03] it my quality of life will be
[45:05] drastically worse it seems to me that
[45:09] putting some amount of money in into
[45:12] mstr in in the hopes honestly would it's
[45:15] a hope it's not a guarantee that it
[45:17] doubles seems decent that seems like a
[45:20] decent idea to me I don't know if it's a
[45:22] great idea but it seems like a decent
[45:23] idea to me and then the last I'm glad I
[45:25] remember it all four the last is you
[45:27] just like what sailor has done I I I
[45:29] purchased $40 of the share when it was
[45:32] like $250 so I got point one 15% of a
[45:37] share and that's probably all I'm going
[45:39] to put into it and it's more of a hey
[45:41] thumbs up thank you sailor for being a
[45:43] large breason that I that I got orange
[45:45] build I I like what you guys are doing
[45:47] over there you're a Bitcoin focused
[45:48] company thumbs up to that but I'm not
[45:51] going to be putting a sizable chunk
[45:54] because I I mean h ly at the end of the
[45:57] day you can self- custody Bitcoin and
[46:00] you can't with mstr I can sell I can
[46:03] move I can do whatever I want Bitcoin is
[46:05] a beer asset mstr is not it's a vehicle
[46:08] it's a thing to do stuff with and hey
[46:12] the world needs that apparent apparently
[46:14] it does needs all this Wall Street stuff
[46:16] but um yeah so on the note of the fast
[46:20] thing
[46:21] uh anybody that says that the world
[46:25] can't change to a Bitcoin stand standard
[46:27] or that oh no it can't go that high that
[46:29] fast has absolutely no idea what they're
[46:31] talking about I mean truly none and they
[46:33] have a very short memory as well you and
[46:36] anybody else that was alive and
[46:38] conscious in the past four years and I
[46:41] guess over the age of like 10 because
[46:43] you had enough awareness notice that the
[46:45] world changed really really fast in a
[46:48] short amount of time super fast we went
[46:51] from not having to wear masks to needing
[46:53] to wear masks to not being locked inside
[46:54] to being locked in I mean huge huge
[46:56] Chang across the world now I'm not
[46:58] making a claim to one way or another on
[47:00] any of that but I I will now I think
[47:03] there was a bunch of [ __ ]
[47:05] but the world changed huge like that
[47:08] that's undenying
[47:10] and it
[47:12] changed I we went from living one way to
[47:15] another way in the course of 18 months
[47:18] 24 and that was with some portion of the
[47:22] world some portion of the population not
[47:25] really wanting to not being a fan of
[47:27] that so we had these social pressures to
[47:31] do different things in different ways
[47:33] and oh we've got plexiglass in front of
[47:36] cashiers and we've got all these
[47:38] different things and some stores did it
[47:39] really fast because they had plexiglass
[47:41] kicking around so they were able to do
[47:42] it other places had to wait on supply
[47:44] chain things and other places were like
[47:45] we just don't want to do this until the
[47:47] city came in and said if you don't do
[47:48] this we're going to shut you down so
[47:49] there's some there was some dragging of
[47:51] feet there was all these different
[47:53] things but it it didn't move nearly as
[47:56] fast as as it could have if everybody
[47:58] was on board let's do this right now
[48:00] today I If that had been the case it
[48:02] would have changed within like six
[48:03] months but when you have an incentive to
[48:07] change I don't know how fast that
[48:09] changes like super super super super
[48:12] fast I imagine that all these terminals
[48:15] that you see I don't know what how it is
[48:17] where you live but pretty much
[48:18] everywhere you go now maybe it's been
[48:20] this way for a while you've got these
[48:21] little terminals where you go to pay and
[48:23] you either tap your card that's that's
[48:26] probably the most common way that people
[48:28] pay that I see these days or or you're
[48:30] not really tapping you're just kind of
[48:31] holding it in the region of the little
[48:32] reader and it sucks the money out of
[48:34] your card and then you go on your way or
[48:36] your phone or in some cases you you
[48:39] stick the chip in there or in the real
[48:41] rare cases these days because your card
[48:44] is old or the chip is broken or whatever
[48:46] you swipe it you actually swipe it that
[48:48] used to be the most common way but
[48:49] that's the least common way now well all
[48:52] of these readers have a little screen
[48:54] right there I mean every single one that
[48:56] I've seen has a little screen right
[48:58] there it would take a simple software
[49:00] update for that screen to show a QR code
[49:03] and suddenly you're using your phone
[49:04] which I don't know 25% of people do
[49:07] already anyways and you scan that boom
[49:08] you're paying with Bitcoin it wouldn't
[49:10] take much effort at all or you're you
[49:13] have a card that's linked to your phone
[49:14] that is holding your Bitcoin and if
[49:18] nation state adoption does happen if we
[49:21] do see a strategic Bitcoin Reserve
[49:23] happen in the US I I think it's going to
[49:26] be a
[49:27] it's going to be that Meme the the guy
[49:29] with the Domino you're probably going to
[49:30] see the first one being El Salvador
[49:31] although I I thumbs up to what a lot of
[49:34] what they're doing down there but I
[49:35] don't know that El Salvador could really
[49:38] be pointed to as the reason that the
[49:40] world got on a Bitcoin
[49:44] standard I I don't know some people
[49:46] might point to that but if the United
[49:48] States comes out and says we're buying
[49:50] without
[49:52] question 200 what is it they want to do
[49:54] 200,000 Bitcoin a year over five years
[49:58] there's in my mind 0% chance that the
[50:00] rest of the world goes oh that's cool
[50:01] for you have fun with that
[50:04] I I'm pretty sure that the rest of the
[50:07] world goes oh [ __ ] we need to buy as
[50:09] much as we can too for all the reasons
[50:12] that the you you just can't let your
[50:15] competitor in some cases your enemy get
[50:18] this Advantage like that there's just
[50:20] you you can't
[50:22] and I I don't know where who it was
[50:25] there oh he's on
[50:27] nval
[50:28] naal he said I think it was like 10
[50:31] years ago or something was in the price
[50:34] of Bitcoin was in the the three digits
[50:36] it was like $100 or something he said
[50:39] one of the most preent tweets maybe ever
[50:42] he said if you're a developing country I
[50:44] I'm paraphrasing here and you want
[50:47] to like increase your standing in the
[50:49] world something like this buy as much
[50:51] Bitcoin as you can right now I mean
[50:54] imagine if they had done that some small
[50:56] imagine if El Salvador had bought as
[50:57] much Bitcoin as they possibly could 10
[51:00] years ago or whatever it was 13 years
[51:01] ago when he made this tweet at $100 a
[51:05] piece they they their their value would
[51:10] rival that
[51:11] of major countries right now it would be
[51:14] insane and so I think that
[51:19] when the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve
[51:21] happens assuming it does and it's things
[51:24] that I've been seeing online and I mean
[51:27] I know Dennis Porter gets a lot of crap
[51:29] oh here he is again doing all this hype
[51:31] stuff but man it you can't deny the
[51:35] results like he's on the plane he's
[51:37] going around he's talking to these
[51:38] politicians he's in these spaces you see
[51:41] him with Ted Cruz you see him at these
[51:43] different places helping getting these
[51:44] bills passed like that that's having
[51:47] some impact clearly he says that all
[51:51] these different people maybe some of
[51:52] it's hype sure but there's truth there
[51:56] two it's not like he's just flat out
[51:58] lying and saying oh there's politicians
[51:59] that are interested in these strategic
[52:02] Bitcoin Reserve things I mean we saw the
[52:03] news come out of uh what was it
[52:06] Pennsylvania recently saying that they
[52:07] wanted to do that and then there's talk
[52:09] I think there was I think I might have
[52:11] this wrong but I'm pretty sure there was
[52:12] a tweet or something from
[52:13] representatives from Texas saying that
[52:15] they wanted to do the same thing is it
[52:18] it's not nothing and he's part of those
[52:20] conversations to some degree like you
[52:23] don't dedicate as far as I can tell your
[52:25] life to the SAT action fund and raise
[52:28] money to go and do this thing for this
[52:30] explicit goal and there's other people
[52:32] doing it on the the global scale Samson
[52:34] Mau and Adam back which is great that
[52:36] that's wonderful but I'm partial to the
[52:39] country that I live in and I want to see
[52:40] it here and also I'm partial to this
[52:42] country doing it
[52:44] because like I just mentioned about El
[52:46] Salvador I don't know how much of an
[52:48] impact even a bigger country
[52:51] like I don't know let's say France if
[52:53] France came out and said we're adopting
[52:55] a Bitcoin strategic Reserve like I I
[52:57] don't know that that would have quite
[52:59] the same Ripple effects as the United
[53:02] States saying it or China or Brazil one
[53:06] of the really big countries out there
[53:08] China Russia Brazil India maybe Canada
[53:12] the UK some something with the Germany
[53:16] maybe I don't know what France's GDP is
[53:18] but I think Germany's got it beat I
[53:20] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[53:24] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[53:26] that I ever saw created by anyone look

[54:11] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[54:14] love those watches so so much if you
[54:17] watch or listen to my podcast on a
[54:19] regular basis I'll guess you already
[54:21] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[54:24] important step is to keep their Bitcoin
[54:27] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[54:29] personal recommendation for Hardware
[54:31] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[54:34] it's simple to set up it's also perfect

[54:49] to get your bitbox and the next step is
[54:51] to really level up your sovereignty as
[54:54] an individual you have to have the most
[54:56] secure self- custody setup you have to
[54:59] secure your own devices you have to
[55:02] protect your privacy you have to set up
[55:05] an inheritance plan and depending on
[55:07] where you live you even want to have a
[55:10] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[55:12] in case something goes really really
[55:14] wrong and through all those steps the
[55:16] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step

[55:22] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[55:25] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[55:28] how you can level up your sovereignty
[55:32] Germany is the biggest one in the in
[55:33] Europe and I think FR is second or third
[55:36] something like that but yeah like uh you
[55:40] definitely need a bigger a bigger one as
[55:42] Salvador is a and even they didn't they
[55:45] don't even own that many Bitcoin like
[55:47] one Bitcoin a day buying uh I think it's
[55:51] something along the lines of like three
[55:53] or 4% of their capabilities of of what
[55:57] they they could own so even though they
[56:00] are really conservatively doing that and
[56:04] obviously like El Salvador is smaller
[56:06] than Austria and way poorer than Austria
[56:09] and Austria is just like a such a small
[56:11] country some sometimes we think about
[56:13] saor too much and and too big because
[56:15] it's just mentioned so many times but
[56:17] it's a small country and a poor country
[56:18] too obviously it has a really big
[56:21] symbolic effect
[56:23] but as as of the real effects like if if
[56:27] Donald Trump is tweeting
[56:29] something uh that is going to get
[56:32] discussed in every country in every
[56:35] Secret Service Agency around the world
[56:38] if El Salvador neb is tweeting something
[56:42] that might also get discussed depending
[56:44] on what it is but not even close to the
[56:47] degree of how closely America is watched
[56:52] by everyone and with all the agencies so
[56:55] like asador is very small fish against a
[56:59] huge
[57:00] huge maybe against a huge ocean of of
[57:04] America yeah it's kind of like maybe not
[57:07] to the same degree but a similar degree
[57:10] if Michael sailor says something if
[57:12] you're in Bitcoin and you've been paying
[57:13] attention you know about it obviously
[57:15] but if you don't it's like okay who's
[57:17] this guy whatever but if Tim Cook comes
[57:20] out and says something about the the
[57:22] we've got this new thing whatever the
[57:25] the VR
[57:27] contacts that stick onto your eyes and
[57:29] you can see the internet in real time
[57:31] that's going to W make way more news
[57:33] it's going to be on the front page of
[57:35] some newspapers it's going to be all
[57:36] over the Internet it's GNA be a big big
[57:38] big deal and he's just one CEO and
[57:41] Michael sailor's another CEO but one of
[57:44] those I think micro strategy they have
[57:46] more Bitcoin now than than El Salvador
[57:49] right a lot more a lot more yeah AO has
[57:53] a few thousand Bitcoin I think and uh
[57:55] micro has a few hundred, Bitcoin so it's
[57:59] not it's not even close and micro
[58:01] strategy has way more but in apple it's
[58:02] really interesting because Michael saor
[58:04] actually brought that up uh what if
[58:07] Apple goes ahead and makes a multi
[58:10] signature self- custody wallet where
[58:13] when you have the iPad your iPhone and
[58:16] the Apple watch together and you press
[58:18] the buttons you can transfer something
[58:19] and it's like a custodia solution like
[58:21] that that that onboards a lot of people
[58:24] and it's native and it's really nice and
[58:25] it's the user interface is super easy as
[58:27] we are used to by Apple uh so obviously
[58:31] maybe a similar size of like apple
[58:33] versus micro strategy of of of the
[58:35] impact right now that might change I had
[58:38] recently a guest on who said like if if
[58:40] Apple continues like that and micro
[58:41] strategy continues like that micro
[58:43] strategy might buy
[58:44] Apple yeah yeah I I don't know exactly
[58:49] what goes into purchasing a company of
[58:51] that size but I don't know that micro
[58:53] strategy would want to buy Apple I don't
[58:54] know what the advantage would be for
[58:57] them I think it seems like given his M
[59:02] the micro strategy's recent earnings
[59:04] call and when they changed what they are
[59:06] to a Bitcoin treasury company that that
[59:09] that is the core of what they are doing
[59:11] now and they have their
[59:13] nine like guidelines guiding principles
[59:16] number one is Buy and Hold Bitcoin
[59:18] that's just I don't remember what the
[59:19] other nine are or the other eight rather
[59:21] but number one is Buy and Hold Bitcoin
[59:23] and so I don't see how purchasing some
[59:25] other software technology company with
[59:28] all of the different things and I I mean
[59:31] Rory Quant has talked about this a bunch
[59:33] on different times on the the true nor
[59:36] things and and it's something that I
[59:37] think is extremely underappreciated and
[59:40] not even really thought about is he he
[59:43] like he he talks about how he got into
[59:46] Tesla when that was popping off and he
[59:48] says to understand what Tesla is doing
[59:50] is so more complicated than what micro
[59:53] strategy is doing you've got to look at
[59:54] the batteries and how they get the
[59:56] batteries and how these parts are
[59:57] developed in this country and then the
[59:59] parts are shipped over here and then not
[60:01] to even mention how elon's must his time
[60:03] is split between Tesla and then over
[60:06] with SpaceX and I don't even know how he
[60:08] does all of what he does and admittedly
[60:10] he's got tons of people so I don't know
[60:12] how much Elon himself is doing but he
[60:15] certainly is the face of these companies
[60:17] like like if somebody said like who do
[60:18] you think of when you name a person
[60:20] related to SpaceX like well it's Elon
[60:22] and a bunch of faceless people that I
[60:25] that are all extremely important
[60:26] obviously it's not like Elon himself is
[60:28] not Tony Stark he's not actually doing
[60:30] these things he's not a genius flying
[60:32] around in his Iron Man suit landing at
[60:34] this place and doing it all himself then
[60:35] going off and doing it over there he's
[60:37] got teams of really really smart people
[60:40] obviously but what they're doing is so
[60:44] complic like
[60:45] you you you can't come in and be like oh
[60:49] we're going to be the next Tesla no
[60:50] you're not I mean not right away you're
[60:52] not or or we're going to be the next
[60:54] Nvidia really you are where are you
[60:57] going to build your chips where where
[60:58] how are you going to do that you're not
[61:00] going to do that you you could you could
[61:02] start to I guess try but the chances
[61:05] that you actually come along and
[61:06] overtake Nvidia
[61:08] is basically zero because chances are if
[61:11] you're doing really well they'll just
[61:12] come along and say here here's $50
[61:14] billion doar for you to be a part of us
[61:16] now that's a lot of money sure I guess
[61:18] I'll do that now like the chances that
[61:20] you just keep on doing your thing is is
[61:22] really small but the wild thing about
[61:25] mstr is and sailor said this multiple
[61:27] times like here's what we're doing by
[61:29] all means please copy
[61:31] us because they're so far ahead in their
[61:34] Holdings
[61:35] that I I don't I don't
[61:39] know the world's going to be so weird in
[61:41] 10 years that a lot of people point to
[61:44] different dates as like oh this date
[61:46] that date the date that I'm looking
[61:47] forward to at least in Bitcoin terms is
[61:49] is 2032 that that having I think is the
[61:53] most significant one for multiple
[61:56] reasons at that point 99% of all Bitcoin
[62:00] has been mined and then also that's the
[62:02] first time that the the subsidy goes
[62:05] below even one Bitcoin I think it's 73
[62:09] something Bitcoin per or 76 or it's it's
[62:13] three4 of a Bitcoin roughly at 2032 that
[62:17] that's a it's a big deal and I
[62:20] think
[62:22] I I I I can I can foresee might happen
[62:26] so much faster than that but I can
[62:27] definitely see that being the wakeup
[62:29] call for the world when people like oh
[62:32] oh [ __ ] I really should have gotten some
[62:34] of this Bitcoin thing you still can that
[62:37] that's the wild thing is like there's
[62:38] never a bad time I just had a family
[62:39] member via another family member so one
[62:42] that I don't yeah
[62:44] 2032 yeah 0 78 78 yeah yeah that that's
[62:51] that's wild but I had a family member
[62:52] that I don't talk to ask another family
[62:54] member that I do talk to oh hey let me
[62:56] know when Bitcoin goes down it's I mean
[62:59] it is that Meme like oh I I don't want
[63:01] to buy it right now let me know I I said
[63:03] just tell this other person that it's on
[63:06] sale compared to the million dollars
[63:08] that it's going to be at in the not to
[63:09] so distant future but that doesn't that
[63:11] doesn't work they see it go up it's it
[63:13] is that Meme where it's like the line of
[63:15] people for the the one booth where
[63:17] bitcoin's whatever $90,000 and then the
[63:20] other booth is it's it's $50,000 and
[63:22] there's nobody in
[63:23] line yeah it's like uh what once Bitcoin
[63:26] is up at like 100k people are saying
[63:29] like oh I will wait till it goes back
[63:31] down to 50K and then when it actually
[63:33] goes back down to 50K people are like oh
[63:36] good that I never bought it go back up
[63:38] to 250k it's
[63:41] like it's it's so dumb like even people
[63:44] that are that have it around me is
[63:46] saying like oh like is it is it now a
[63:48] good time to buy and if someone asked
[63:50] that questions I know he needs to do
[63:53] more research and he didn't fully
[63:55] understand it if if you fully understand
[63:56] Bitcoin you don't ask when to buy uh
[63:59] you're like yeah like H how can I buy
[64:01] more like how do I get more of that uh
[64:04] but not you don't ask like oh like it
[64:07] will it go up next year yeah usually I I
[64:10] have my paycheck automatically I have
[64:14] um so I know there's a lot of different
[64:16] exchanges out there but the one that I
[64:18] use by far hands down the most is Cash
[64:21] app they're one of two that I I believe
[64:23] I might have this incorrect but I know
[64:25] River has proof of reserves and I think
[64:28] that cash app does too and I I think
[64:31] they do and another reason that I even
[64:33] if they don't they are 100% only Bitcoin
[64:37] they've got little education things on
[64:38] their phone it's like here learn about
[64:40] Bitcoin they they have no other of the
[64:42] the shitcoins on there you can buy
[64:44] stocks and whatnot but if you have X
[64:48] amount of dollars I don't remember what
[64:50] the threshold is but if you have some
[64:52] amount of dollars it's like 200 bucks or
[64:54] 300 or something like that from paycheck
[64:56] direct deposit in there you can set up
[64:59] automatic Buys in a river and I think
[65:02] others have this too but cash up is just
[65:03] really easy where uh it'll automatically
[65:07] purchase when you get your direct
[65:09] deposit some amount you you pick the
[65:11] percentage of Bitcoin or stocks as well
[65:14] for zero fee no fee so I have some
[65:17] portion of my paychecks going in and
[65:19] just does that every two weeks I don't
[65:21] think about it it just just it just
[65:23] happens sometimes I get more SATs than
[65:25] other like these days I've been getting
[65:27] well not not a great deal on sats I I
[65:29] missed the two 2500 plus days um but
[65:33] it's still something and I I think in
[65:36] the Noto distant future we're going to
[65:37] be in the the three
[65:39] digits that's sad to think about it's
[65:42] it's happy it's it's bittersweet but
[65:44] yeah I wish there was a a good way for
[65:46] me to explain that to people that
[65:48] there's never a bad time to buy Bitcoin
[65:51] it's like saying that doesn't really
[65:52] work the same way but it's almost like
[65:54] saying it's a never a bad time to buy
[65:55] buy
[65:57] food but it's not it's not quite the
[65:59] same
[66:00] like I always answer with like uh the
[66:04] best and and I got that from some quote
[66:07] I don't remember where I heard it first
[66:08] but it's really popular I think um the
[66:11] best time to buy Bitcoin is 10 years ago
[66:14] and the second best time is now
[66:15] [Music]
[66:16] so but but it it it doesn't really bring
[66:20] the point across why it is uh so uh I I
[66:24] don't know it's it's it's just
[66:26] um I I always point to people educate
[66:29] yourself like re really go deeper like
[66:32] try to understand that don't try to make
[66:35] money with it try to understand it
[66:37] always try to make them realize that
[66:40] could be the biggest for natural
[66:41] Revolution ever and if you think that
[66:44] even has a 5% chance of being true maybe
[66:48] you should research that uh maybe you
[66:51] should not miss out on that so uh please
[66:53] make like a Sunday evening free and at
[66:57] least watch like three four podcasts and
[67:00] and and do some research or go ahead and
[67:02] read those two books uh and the the
[67:06] worst case uh situation here is you get
[67:09] out a little bit more educated and you
[67:12] lost a few hours so and and the best
[67:14] case scenario is like you know now what
[67:17] the biggest Financial Revolution is and
[67:19] and how it's happening and stuff like
[67:20] that so I I always Point again to to
[67:24] education
[67:26] um and I'm really passive now with
[67:28] orange ping people I don't want to
[67:30] because I have seen it where I said like
[67:32] yeah like it's a great buy now and then
[67:34] it went down half half a month later uh
[67:37] and then they're upset and so like I'm
[67:39] really really really defensive now and
[67:41] say like I don't know like you you can
[67:44] sell some I I buy them for you like if
[67:47] you sell at the right prices I would buy
[67:50] from you uh it's okay for me uh and uh
[67:55] only advice is always like just educate
[67:58] yourself like don't miss out on on the
[68:00] educational side of
[68:01] Bitcoin yeah yeah and there's no excuse
[68:04] for not being educated like my the thing
[68:06] that I point to people if they like well
[68:08] where where should I learn more is I
[68:09] point them to the Bitcoin standard which
[68:11] there's an audiobook version of it on
[68:13] YouTube that you can listen to the whole
[68:16] 11 odd hours in sixish or fiveish if you
[68:20] want to increase the speed I'd recommend
[68:22] like not going too much too fast because
[68:24] especially if it's your first listen you
[68:26] probably want want to catch most of it
[68:27] but there's and if you don't
[68:30] get the the the idea of why Bitcoin is
[68:33] important by the end of that well then
[68:36] you know good good luck I guess I I
[68:37] don't I don't know what to tell you that
[68:39] that book breaks it down so simple and
[68:41] why money works the way it works and
[68:44] what it is I mean the first twoth thirds
[68:46] of the book I think Bitcoin is mentioned
[68:48] by name like once or twice it it barely
[68:50] even comes up most of it is what money
[68:53] is and I think that was one of if not
[68:55] the biggest eye openers for me when
[68:57] going down the whole rabbit hole is
[68:59] understanding what money is and it's
[69:01] this this thing this fundamental to our
[69:04] every day and most people don't even
[69:06] question I I never did like oh money
[69:09] comes in and I use it to buy things but
[69:10] I never thought to ask what is this
[69:13] stuff and it wasn't until I
[69:15] realized as far as I can tell that
[69:18] Bitcoin is or not Bitcoin well it but
[69:21] all money is your time and energy turned
[69:24] into this thing that is holding it for
[69:26] you in a in a digital in bitcoin's case
[69:28] or money generally speaking now
[69:30] currencies but also in tangible cases
[69:32] like
[69:34] any I don't know if I heard this
[69:36] somewhere or if it just came up with
[69:37] myself probably heard it somewhere that
[69:40] um all currency is money but not all
[69:43] money is currency and a lot of people
[69:45] don't know the difference between
[69:47] currencies and monies money is just a
[69:49] place where you're holding your T like
[69:51] this cup I guess to somebody could be
[69:53] money I don't know who but it's holding
[69:56] some amount of value I I drink coffee
[69:59] out of it nearly every day so it's
[70:00] valuable to me in that regard and I have
[70:02] kind of a sentimental value because of
[70:04] that and like if if this coffee cup were
[70:06] to break I'd be a little bummed about it
[70:08] is that money yeah sure various tradable
[70:12] cards that I have different Magic the
[70:13] Gathering cards that's money certainly
[70:15] worth more than in some cases more than
[70:18] a dollar bill a lot more than a dollar
[70:20] bill in some cases to the right person
[70:23] the the thing about a dollar bill or
[70:24] different currencies is that it's more
[70:26] tradable than Magic the Gathering cards
[70:28] like I can't go to many stores I can't
[70:30] go to a grocery store and hand them a
[70:31] magic the Gathering card I could go to a
[70:33] card store and get some trade credit for
[70:35] it and buy the crappy snacks that they
[70:36] have so I could feed myself with magic
[70:38] the Gathering cards but not as easily as
[70:39] with a dollar
[70:40] bill but so many people don't understand
[70:43] that it's it's so simple once you
[70:46] understand it and maybe that's why in a
[70:49] in a paradoxical way why it's so
[70:51] difficult to understand that you take
[70:53] your time and energy you get this for it
[70:56] and this thing allows you to money the
[70:58] currency allows you to get kind of
[71:00] whatever else you want if you have
[71:02] enough of it you can get pretty much
[71:03] anything you want and it's going away
[71:07] every minute of every day it it is
[71:09] leaving in some way and Bitcoin and this
[71:13] is why Bitcoin is always a good trade
[71:15] because it's not going away it's sitting
[71:17] there it just sits
[71:20] there and holds your time and energy it
[71:22] just it just is what it is whereas any
[71:25] other form is deflating like well not
[71:29] not my house no it is it is that's why
[71:32] the whole oh the value of it is going up
[71:34] it's not really going up like your house
[71:36] didn't get 10% better if anything it it
[71:40] probably got 10% worse it's got mold and
[71:43] it's got Moss on it and it's got cracks
[71:44] and it's like it probably needs some
[71:46] repairs like it it entrop is a real
[71:49] thing except with Bitcoin it actually
[71:53] that's which is kind of I don't I don't
[71:55] understand that one that one kind of
[71:57] breaks your brain that Bitcoin defies
[71:59] that it says Ah entrop is cool but nah
[72:02] wait
[72:04] what it it's really I mean you have to
[72:08] make a very small investment of keeping
[72:10] it safe like the the hardare the
[72:12] software maybe a service maybe uh um the
[72:15] the investment of educating yourself or
[72:17] the investment of getting service or
[72:20] advice around it so that's a very small
[72:23] cost to to holding bit coin and uh I
[72:26] think was it in Nashville conference
[72:29] where Michael saor talks about that uh
[72:32] about Bitcoin and the cost of holding it
[72:35] but it's it's just way better because
[72:37] Bitcoin itself doesn't erode away uh you
[72:41] just have to make sure that you keep it
[72:45] yeah yeah yeah your ability to hold it
[72:48] your memory might erode that probably
[72:50] will so you got to make sure you have
[72:51] some a decent setup but even if you
[72:53] forget all your seed word and you you
[72:55] didn't put it into steel or whatever you
[72:57] you burn the notebook that you written
[72:59] it down and it's still there it's it's
[73:02] inaccessible for you but it's there
[73:04] somewhere just just chilling waiting to
[73:07] be accessed
[73:10] yeah but abolutely as far as mstr goes
[73:15] um I think it's going to go a lot higher
[73:18] it's funny because I I believe two
[73:21] things at once I believe that mstr is
[73:23] gonna go a whole lot higher I I have no
[73:25] idea how high and I also believe that it
[73:27] is not for me to invest
[73:31] in because I I no no more than what I
[73:35] have I there's just so
[73:39] many I I I didn't get into Bitcoin
[73:44] because I really like markets and I
[73:47] really like understanding all the Nuance
[73:51] about fractional reserve and options and
[73:54] all all the stuff that Wall Street and
[73:56] the banking world I I it's interesting
[73:59] to me to some degree but it it's not
[74:02] what I want to do with my time I want to
[74:05] spend time with my family I want to
[74:07] write stuff I want to I want to enjoy
[74:09] life and and to me that that's a side
[74:12] thing there there are people out there
[74:13] really that really like doing that stuff
[74:15] and then great whatever that that's not
[74:17] my primary interest and so once I found
[74:22] Bitcoin and kind of got it I went all
[74:24] right cool that there we go I'm kind of
[74:27] done I just in I put money into Bitcoin
[74:29] it holds my time and energy and and that
[74:31] that's it I don't really need to do a
[74:33] whole lot else um I still like looking
[74:36] at the podcast listening to the podcast
[74:38] and hearing people talk about different
[74:39] things it's it's it's generally
[74:40] interesting but I'm not trying to get a
[74:42] deep understanding of of the markets at
[74:45] large
[74:48] and I think for most people they just
[74:51] need to get that amount of understanding
[74:53] like they they don't need to sit there
[74:54] and I I think maybe that's what they
[74:56] think when they they hear about Bitcoin
[74:57] like oh I'm going to have to spend all
[74:58] this time to understand it not really
[75:00] and I think that's kind of what you were
[75:01] hinting at earlier with with grandma
[75:04] giving you some Bitcoin I think that's
[75:05] the world that we'll end up at is it'll
[75:07] be like the internet or whatever you
[75:09] people aren't sitting there stressing
[75:11] about how the internet works when you go
[75:13] to type an email it's just it works I
[75:16] don't know how long it is until we get
[75:18] to that point but I think the the
[75:20] suddenly part will happen really
[75:22] suddenly people oh we're not suddenly
[75:25] phase now no we're not no we're
[75:29] not it'll be it'll be so sudden and so
[75:32] fast that it'll
[75:34] be I think within six months you'll go
[75:37] from one world into the next and you
[75:39] like oh that was the suddenly phase
[75:41] ah okay it was when the US announced
[75:45] that they they had made their first
[75:47] purchase of
[75:49] 50,000 Bitcoin and each quarter they
[75:51] were going to buy another 50,000 or I
[75:53] guess yeah 50,000 so that they get to
[75:56] their 200 a year and that started then
[75:58] we saw this chain effect of other
[75:59] countries doing the same thing that that
[76:01] was the suddenly phase
[76:05] aha it's a by the way because just fits
[76:08] so nicely uh yesterday's episode
[76:11] actually was with Pac Lewis the off off
[76:14] gradually then suddenly and we went
[76:16] whole hour into this topic how suddenly
[76:19] looks like uh so if if people want to
[76:22] dive deeper here it's just yesterday's
[76:24] episode epe uh but yeah
[76:26] it's say on that
[76:28] point um I asked him uh I mean don't
[76:33] don't want to recap the whole whole
[76:35] podcast but the the essence was H like
[76:39] in in hindsight it will be very obvious
[76:42] when the suddenly part is and if if you
[76:46] had to ask is the is the suddenly part
[76:50] now here yeah uh we probably are not in
[76:53] there yet so like the the suddenly part
[76:56] will be and he talks about different
[76:58] triggers of like uh we definitely in the
[77:01] suddenly part if you cannot exchange
[77:03] your Bitcoin for exchange your Fiat for
[77:05] Bitcoin anymore like if nobody wants to
[77:08] sell your Bitcoin for Fiat they really
[77:10] want to see product or service for that
[77:12] yeah uh and and other factors uh I think
[77:15] that would be after the suddenly not
[77:17] during yeah it's interesting because
[77:21] like it's also like how long is that
[77:23] suddenly part like what's the beginning
[77:25] what's the end of it uh it's like that
[77:28] that S curve adoption or that I we also
[77:32] covered that exponential growth factor
[77:34] if you um if you fill a a football
[77:38] stadium full of water and people that
[77:41] listen every day on my podcast maybe get
[77:43] bored of that example because it brought
[77:45] it up like seven times in the last two
[77:47] weeks I haven't heard it before but yeah
[77:50] uh I I will bring it up now again uh you
[77:53] do it in one minute one drop the second
[77:55] minute you get two drops in the third
[77:57] minute four drops like it's
[77:59] exponentially growing eight drops 16
[78:01] drops 32 drops and stuff like that uh
[78:04] and after 45 minutes the football
[78:07] stadium is actually 7% already filled
[78:10] and you just need five more minutes to
[78:12] fill it 100% full so from Seven uh uh%
[78:16] of 100% you go just from 45 minutes to
[78:19] 50 minutes and there are a lot of
[78:21] different examples to to see uh to show
[78:24] how crazy exponential growth is like um
[78:28] folding the paper is also interesting
[78:31] one yeah well the one I remember from my
[78:33] childhood is my dad asked me he said
[78:35] would you take a million dollars right
[78:37] now or if you had a penny that was
[78:40] doubled every day for a month so penny
[78:43] two penny two cents 4 cents 8 cents
[78:46] would you want that at the end of the
[78:47] month and I I don't remember what I said
[78:49] I probably said well the million dollars
[78:51] right and he's like well the penny would
[78:52] be some I don't know I I don't remember
[78:54] what the math is but it's it's a lot
[78:56] more than a million dollars it's I think
[78:57] it's multiple
[79:00] Millions absolutely yeah
[79:03] and I just thought about it did you see
[79:05] that video where people uh were asking
[79:09] uh on on the streets uh in front of like
[79:12] a concert hall or something like that um
[79:15] or do you want the um Taylor Swift
[79:17] concert ticket or a
[79:19] Bitcoin people overwhelm me said with
[79:23] tickets and that's also tells you a
[79:25] little bit like we are early like go out
[79:28] there on the streets ask people we in a
[79:30] Bitcoin bubble uh you listening to
[79:33] podcast you're on Twitter uh you're
[79:35] talking to a lot of bitcoiners you think
[79:37] we are far ahead you think we're bigger
[79:40] than we actually are uh no we we are
[79:42] very small we are very Niche we are very
[79:45] early yeah yeah the biggest thing that I
[79:48] run into when talking to somebody that
[79:50] isn't into Bitcoin is they think that
[79:56] Bitcoin
[79:57] is they don't think that it's separate
[80:01] they think that Bitcoin is the term for
[80:03] all of the that whole Space it's like no
[80:05] no no Bitcoin is its own thing and so
[80:08] usually that's where I before I even go
[80:10] any further I go okay you got to
[80:12] understand that Bitcoin is not crypto
[80:15] that that is a phrase or that that's a
[80:17] word to describe all of that whole
[80:20] nonsense sure and you could put Bitcoin
[80:23] under that umbrella it is a
[80:25] cryptocurrency yes but it is also it's
[80:29] it's it's completely separate from all
[80:30] that so I try to break that down and I I
[80:33] I I'm
[80:35] hoping I'm hoping all those [ __ ] coins
[80:38] go away within I don't think they're
[80:40] going to go away for a little while but
[80:43] boy I I hope the sooner the better on
[80:46] that note recently someone brought it up
[80:48] to me um do you think micro strategy
[80:51] might be a similar distraction from bit
[80:54] coin as it was in the past with altcoins
[80:57] like in the past people were obsessed
[80:59] with altcoins to get more Bitcoin and
[81:01] now they kind of are distracted by micro
[81:04] strategy they want to get into micro
[81:06] strategy to then make more Bitcoin do
[81:08] you think micro strategy might be a
[81:11] distraction to to to bitcoin harders to
[81:14] diversify or get more risk in involved
[81:17] with micro strategy yeah I think there's
[81:19] a couple things there and I've
[81:21] definitely felt one of them and I think
[81:22] part of it is fomo like when you hear
[81:24] about
[81:25] who hasn't heard a story about some
[81:27] stock Amazon and Microsoft oh man if I
[81:29] had bought a 100 did you you know I had
[81:31] a friend that told me about Amazon back
[81:34] when it was first a thing and he said
[81:36] that he really thought it was going to
[81:37] be a thing do you know that if I had put
[81:38] $1,000 into that it would like I I put
[81:41] my thousand I remember clear's day I got
[81:44] a Bonus it was it was just shy of $1,000
[81:46] it was
[81:48] $997 and I put it into Toys R R Us
[81:50] because I thought Toys R R Us was going
[81:52] to really be the next I thought all
[81:54] these toys and the way video games were
[81:55] going I thought that was a thing and if
[81:57] I put that ,000 into Amazon instead of
[81:59] Toys R Us I'd be a multi-millionaire
[82:01] today like everybody's got some friend
[82:03] or some story about that do you know if
[82:05] I bought that house when I had the
[82:06] opportunity that i' did you know that if
[82:08] I did
[82:09] you did you know that if I bought
[82:11] GameStop do you know that like I I think
[82:13] people hear about these things with mstr
[82:15] and like oh if I only I'd bought back
[82:17] when when this and it's the same thing
[82:19] with Bitcoin if only I had bought back
[82:21] but the thing with all of those those is
[82:26] that Bitcoin stands alone is in that you
[82:29] you can buy today and it's still going
[82:31] to go up is are the other ones going to
[82:33] go up I I I don't know I I I don't know
[82:35] is msdr going to go up well given that
[82:37] their whole base layer is Bitcoin it
[82:39] seems like it I don't know but I do know
[82:42] that being globally accepted that
[82:45] Bitcoin really seems like it's going to
[82:47] keep on going up but not for the reasons
[82:49] that people seem to think about but as
[82:51] far as a distraction yeah I I I I really
[82:55] think that that Odell's strategy is the
[82:59] best stay humble and stack SATs like I I
[83:01] I don't think that there has been a
[83:04] investment strategy that beats that one
[83:07] for the masses I guess there are going
[83:09] to be individuals that find some
[83:12] opportunity with mstr and and they're
[83:14] they're going to post about it on Wall
[83:16] Street bets or they're going to post
[83:17] about it on Twitter it's like oh I did
[83:18] this thing and everybody else will see
[83:20] that like ah man if I oh why didn't I
[83:22] think of that thing what I'm curious
[83:25] about and and in interested to see
[83:29] and so it seems like whenever something
[83:32] like GameStop or mstr happens people
[83:35] think that that's the last one and I
[83:38] missed it I missed it if only I'd been
[83:40] there for a GameStop when it was popping
[83:41] off I could I could I could be worth so
[83:43] much money now if only I'd been there
[83:45] when I'd gotten into mstr four years ago
[83:47] but the thing is is that there's going
[83:48] to be some other company that comes
[83:50] along there's going to be some other
[83:51] company that does what mstr is doing
[83:54] with something else they'll start buying
[83:56] I mean hell rumble's doing it they're
[83:58] they just announced that they're going
[83:59] to start adding 20 million or something
[84:01] to bitcoin treasury asset so some other
[84:04] company's going to come out here and do
[84:06] something interesting with Bitcoin is it
[84:07] going to be as are they gon to have as
[84:10] much Bitcoin as micro strategy no I I
[84:12] don't think that's going to be beaten
[84:14] but they don't have to to have crazy
[84:16] gains like I'm I'm looking forward to
[84:18] some company that does something with
[84:19] video games on top of Bitcoin they have
[84:23] their own in game system and then you
[84:25] can cash out and get Bitcoin for and
[84:28] like I there's going to be so many
[84:29] different interesting things that happen
[84:30] on bitcoin that there's going to be
[84:32] other opportunities to if that's what
[84:33] you're interested in to make a ton of
[84:35] money and so sitting here and foming and
[84:38] crying about mstr I definitely think is
[84:41] a distraction like I I I put this tweet
[84:43] out here and I'm certainly not the first
[84:45] one to say this kind of thing but we
[84:47] probably you probably don't need to
[84:50] listen to another podcast about why
[84:51] bitcoin's a good idea you probably you
[84:54] probably don't you could probably spend
[84:55] that time reading a book or going on a
[84:59] walk or doing basically anything else
[85:01] like picking your nose get that thing
[85:03] nice and clean like do you really need
[85:05] to listen to another podcast I mean I
[85:07] know I'm on a podcast right here talking
[85:09] to a guy who does podcasts for a living
[85:10] but
[85:12] I I mean honestly like how many podcasts
[85:15] do we need to hear with Jeff like I I
[85:18] stopped listening to most of the major
[85:20] people because I've heard Jeff Booth say
[85:23] the same exact act thing 300 times now
[85:26] like I I
[85:28] I I I could go and put a Jeff Booth mask
[85:31] on and do a Jeff Booth impersonation is
[85:33] probably going to be pretty close like I
[85:35] I don't I don't need to listen to him
[85:36] say the same thing again and most people
[85:38] I I think it's we just want the the
[85:41] reminder of am I crazy well you might be
[85:44] but as far as Bitcoin goes I don't think
[85:47] so but yeah to answer your question I I
[85:51] do think that
[85:52] mstr for most people probably is a
[85:55] distraction like just just focus on the
[85:58] things that you're really interested in
[86:00] aside from the markets and and stack
[86:02] SATs and just chill
[86:05] man 100% that's just by the way uh
[86:09] that's also one major reason why I don't
[86:12] want to have all the big ones all over
[86:15] again that's why I in under one year I
[86:19] have 312 guests on uh different ones
[86:23] like 3 12 different guests not not like
[86:27] repeated ones uh and that that's seems
[86:31] to be also really popular with people I
[86:33] have uh episodes with people that have
[86:38] not even an social media account with
[86:40] over 10,000 views on YouTube so you
[86:42] don't need a big name to G GA views and
[86:47] that was a huge insight for me because I
[86:49] thought that's the case you need the big
[86:51] names uh no you just need like
[86:53] interesting cont content you just need
[86:55] like to have like an interesting
[86:56] conversation and people seem to be way
[86:58] more interested in that because most
[87:00] people that listen to that podcast
[87:02] probably know what Jeff Bo and Michael
[87:03] sailor will say but they never heard a
[87:06] random science teacher talk about
[87:08] Bitcoin they never heard someone else so
[87:11] that's really interesting and also what
[87:13] I've seen um you can talk about anything
[87:16] I I made with Lisa half uh whole episode
[87:19] and bring it up that example up a lot
[87:22] but I made a whole episode with about
[87:24] parenting we mentioned Bitcoin maybe
[87:27] three times in in one hour uh so uh that
[87:31] that that that's great way you can just
[87:33] talk talk in different topics also but I
[87:37] do
[87:38] agree um I I think I think for me it's
[87:43] way more interesting to listen to new
[87:45] people uh and people that are not on
[87:49] every podcast for the 10th time but I
[87:53] still will interview I'm like Michael
[87:54] saor will still be next year again on my
[87:56] show um because it gives a bigger
[88:00] platform uh to to the other people also
[88:03] so I'm really big on creating that that
[88:06] stage um but I also know uh people need
[88:12] that confirmation if I go in a topic um
[88:17] uh with for example Jim or with like
[88:20] Diet I sometimes listen to the same guy
[88:24] or the same topic 20 times uh to do all
[88:28] the arguments again and again and again
[88:32] uh and yeah even with political debates
[88:34] before I make my mind up I I read all
[88:36] the uh the programs then I listen to the
[88:39] debate I usually I I'm an addict like I
[88:42] listen to like five
[88:44] 10 same debates with the same people
[88:46] like five times and there's almost no
[88:49] difference just to make sure like oh is
[88:51] it should really vote for them uh so
[88:54] like uh I don't know people have people
[88:58] have a weird like they really want to
[89:00] confirm their things um and be
[89:02] comfortable with something especially
[89:04] with Bitcoin I also noticed when the
[89:06] price either goes up or down fuse a
[89:08] little bit uh higher than usual so
[89:11] either like oh like oh it's going up for
[89:13] the sell let's listen to podcast yeah
[89:15] what what's going on what's Happening
[89:17] and also one thing that I heard from
[89:19] some people that are really deep into
[89:21] Bitcoin that told me uh hey I I know it
[89:24] really good like I have all my money in
[89:26] there like I've done the research but I
[89:28] still like to listen to the Bitcoin
[89:31] podcast because the feat system is so
[89:35] around us that I like to remind myself
[89:39] that about this Bitcoin mindset about
[89:42] the proof of work mindset I just like to
[89:44] really immerse myself closer to that
[89:46] even though I don't get really an an an
[89:49] information out there but I get the the
[89:52] energy out there from from from that so
[89:55] that might also be a thing from people
[89:57] that actually listen to a lot of podcast
[89:58] because I I I know it because people
[90:01] give it to me in the comments there are
[90:02] people out there that say like oh I
[90:05] listen to Three Bitcoin podcast a
[90:07] day because yeah I'm like a carpenter
[90:11] and I can listen to something while I do
[90:13] my my things so uh it's podcast world is
[90:16] is crazy I I thought the podcast world
[90:20] is quite full already but I was like H
[90:22] let's let's do one anyways
[90:24] uh but I have grown mine from zero
[90:27] audience to now between 50 and 100,000
[90:30] people watch my podcast just on YouTube
[90:32] every month uh where I'm like oh there
[90:35] was clearly a need for that I the free
[90:38] market clearly showed that uh uh that I
[90:42] was wrong that there's actually a big
[90:44] need for for another podcast and I think
[90:47] there's a need for many more Bitcoin
[90:49] podcasts uh just if you look at how many
[90:51] crypto podcasts there how many
[90:54] traditional Finance Finance guy podcasts
[90:56] there how many other podcasts there are
[90:59] we actually don't have that many really
[91:02] successful full-time English podcasters
[91:06] uh I mean what Bitcoin did if we count
[91:08] him because he still does Bitcoin
[91:10] podcaster there's Preston [ __ ] there's
[91:11] natal Brunell there's PR from um Bitcoin
[91:15] from Millennials uh there a bunch of
[91:17] other people I Walker from the Bitcoin
[91:19] podcast uh so probably missed some uh
[91:23] but yeah it's the whole world like there
[91:25] are like 1.5 billion people that
[91:27] probably uh know English and they need
[91:30] Bitcoin information uh I I think we we
[91:34] need like at least 10 times more Bitcoin
[91:37] podcasts we need 10 times more Bitcoin
[91:38] books we need way more people speaking
[91:40] up about it uh and I encourage anyone
[91:45] tell your story and I'm gladly a stage
[91:48] for that uh to me every week at least
[91:51] two three people reach out to me and uh
[91:54] that have not even like a real social
[91:56] media account say like hey I have this
[91:57] story I want to be on your podcast I
[91:59] cannot have everyone on but most of them
[92:02] I say like hey let's let's talk about it
[92:04] and then we after we record we decide if
[92:06] we can publish it or not if it was
[92:08] interesting enough um but yeah like go
[92:12] ahead talk about Bitcoin I I I'm I'm
[92:15] gladly the stage to enable that yeah I I
[92:18] I agree that that I think it really
[92:23] depends on on the the voice and I don't
[92:26] mean like the way that you sound I mean
[92:28] everybody's going to bring their own
[92:29] unique perspective to the space and if
[92:31] you dislike one person or it doesn't
[92:34] really mesh with you like I don't know
[92:36] this this host over here it doesn't it's
[92:38] like it's it's why Joe Rogan is so
[92:39] popular or other people are popular or
[92:41] that HW Tua girl which I I don't I've
[92:43] never listened to a podcast I thought
[92:45] when all I saw that but tweeting about
[92:47] she's talking to this Bitcoin or that
[92:48] Bitcoin I thought it was a joke I
[92:49] thought people were lying about that
[92:51] stuff I thought they were just kind of
[92:52] trying to meme this into existence I
[92:53] honestly didn't know that she had a
[92:55] podcast I I thought that her that video
[92:57] that she had made was the full extent of
[93:00] her everything like I didn't know that
[93:02] she was still around and relevant
[93:05] apparently she is to some people why I
[93:08] don't know I have no idea but people
[93:09] like listening to her and I guess she's
[93:12] deep into Bitcoin now or something or
[93:14] crypto see she she she does some crypto
[93:17] things and some [ __ ]
[93:19] conning but uh and and and I think she
[93:23] wants to have on her podcast that would
[93:25] that would be crazy uh I would
[93:28] definitely listen to that because I
[93:29] think it would be fun uh uh could be fun
[93:33] but I don't know like I I've never
[93:34] listened to her other than that one
[93:36] video that got her popular that I listen
[93:38] to uh but also only the small clip
[93:41] because there's a long clip to that
[93:42] video also a longer clip um but yeah uh
[93:48] I I also never to listen to Talk t yeah
[93:53] but apparently there's a demand for it I
[93:54] mean clearly there's there's a line in
[93:56] madmax Fury Road they're looking up it's
[93:58] after they've gone across the desert and
[94:00] they've met with the the the older women
[94:02] out there and they're looking up at the
[94:04] sky and they see a satellite and I think
[94:06] it's one of the older women says
[94:07] everybody back then had their own show
[94:10] and it reminds me of podcasts now and
[94:14] you've got so many different podcasts
[94:16] that have the same kind of guests on
[94:18] you've got the Shawn Ryan podcast where
[94:20] we've got these Navy Seals You've Got
[94:22] The Joe Rogan podcast you've got these
[94:23] different 100 podcasts where they have
[94:26] the same general topics like you're
[94:29] going to you've got an idea of what
[94:31] you're going to hear when you go to one
[94:32] of these podcasts but you go there and
[94:35] you return to go or return to this
[94:37] podcast or that one because you like the
[94:39] host you like the way that things are
[94:42] presented the way that he or she brings
[94:45] up topics and I I I think that you're
[94:49] 100% right that the the space can use
[94:52] more
[94:54] podcast and and handle more podcast for
[94:56] sure because there are some people that
[94:59] are just not going to tune in to you for
[95:00] for whatever reason like a i he sounds
[95:02] too much like Arnold Schwarzenegger I I
[95:04] can't handle it so I'm gonna go and
[95:05] listen to this other person all right
[95:07] fine like that's whatever oh he's got
[95:09] that guy with the stupid hat on again in
[95:11] his glasses GH get out of
[95:14] here it's it's also I mean there are a
[95:19] lot of podcasts and I know and I looked
[95:21] at number up at there 4 million
[95:23] registered podcasts out there um but if
[95:27] you then go ahead and see how many
[95:30] podcasts are actually active and I count
[95:32] in podcast active if it's like one
[95:35] episode per week there is around 200,000
[95:39] uh I think was the number so there are
[95:41] lot lot of people start a podcast uh and
[95:44] register podcast and then like very
[95:46] small amount do it in weekly and then if
[95:49] you talk about how many podcasts are
[95:51] there actually that are serious about it
[95:53] and serious I would say are like at
[95:55] least three episodes per week this is
[95:57] like you do it on like that's your main
[96:00] thing chogan has done 3.4 on average per
[96:04] week for the last 15 years uh with four
[96:08] hours each that that's really serious
[96:11] yeah uh but yeah if you did like three
[96:14] with one hour or two with uh like two
[96:17] three hours that's also serious that
[96:19] that's a small amount of of of podcast
[96:22] that actually out there
[96:24] uh but yeah they're um it's a weird
[96:27] space because there are a lot because
[96:29] you see so many um but at the same time
[96:33] not not that many uh out there and I
[96:36] always like basically everything like oh
[96:39] I'm going to go and do this I'm going to
[96:40] start exercising I'm going to write a
[96:42] book I'm going to learn to play banjo
[96:43] I'm going to do this and you know every
[96:45] year you see all these gym memberships
[96:48] and then a month later like how many
[96:50] people are still going to the gym like
[96:51] ah people start these things and they
[96:54] expect like with the gym membership that
[96:56] they go they do one run on the treadmill
[96:57] lift three things and they look in the
[96:59] mirror like well I didn't do
[97:01] anything you got to do it a whole lot of
[97:03] times or they make one podcast with
[97:05] their buddy they yuck up they smoke some
[97:07] weed eat some donuts and have some
[97:09] laughs and they're like well why didn't
[97:10] 10 million people listen to it I what
[97:15] like you shared it with your three
[97:16] friends on Facebook maybe if you do this
[97:19] for 10 years straight and you build a
[97:21] rapport with each other and you have
[97:22] some different goof song on and you
[97:24] interview your weed dealer and the donut
[97:26] guy like hey maybe you'd have something
[97:28] there but you can't do it one time or
[97:30] even 10 times like you I mean how many
[97:33] times was it before you were able to I I
[97:36] think I saw a post from you recently
[97:37] where you said this is this is your what
[97:40] you do for a living now is that right
[97:42] yeah uh I basically just quickly
[97:44] summarize that I was starting almost
[97:48] exactly a year ago on 28th of November
[97:50] last year so it's almost now it's two
[97:52] days more and it's exactly a year how I
[97:54] do it now and uh I started back then
[97:58] just as yeah I had a full-time job I had
[98:01] no uh thve to do it full-time with the
[98:04] podcast I had a full-time it security
[98:06] job and I just started as like yeah
[98:08] let's let's also have a podcast because
[98:10] I was talking to bitcoin as anyways
[98:12] online actually over over Google meet or
[98:15] something like that and then I was like
[98:17] let's record those episodes uh but then
[98:20] my obsessive mind started coming in and
[98:23] like oh let's let's make a calendar and
[98:25] let's let's ride all those people and
[98:27] then all of the sudden I had that guest
[98:28] list and all of the sudden I had uh
[98:31] podcast going and then like uh uh
[98:34] sponsors were approaching me and saying
[98:36] like hey can we can we sponsor you
[98:38] because it's it's it's a nice podcast
[98:40] and I was like okay and then this from
[98:43] November till February was small
[98:45] progression then I had like a few
[98:47] thousand people listening to me every
[98:48] month uh not big but also not nothing
[98:52] and then I had a small all sponsor
[98:54] sponsorship going on and I was like okay
[98:56] I have momentum I have a sponsorship I
[98:59] have Revenue let's just quit my job that
[99:01] I was really happy with that I was there
[99:04] for six years and jump into that
[99:06] podcasting thing uh out of the blue I
[99:08] had no clue what I was doing uh honestly
[99:12] in in hindsight it went really good but
[99:14] in hindsight it was also really dumb it
[99:16] was an emotional decision it was just
[99:18] like yeah let's just do it like in it
[99:20] was really good like financially even EV
[99:23] it paid off but also Freedom wise it
[99:25] paid off but if you look actually at the
[99:27] facts uh logically I should should not
[99:30] have done it that that's the story every
[99:32] time right I mean how often have people
[99:35] like I took this risk and it was like on
[99:37] all like well it was it wasn't really a
[99:40] risk like if on every level it made
[99:42] sense then it wasn't really a risk it
[99:43] just that was the obvious thing to do
[99:46] absolutely yeah and and it it is was a
[99:48] crazy experience because you all of the
[99:51] sudden don't have that security I I was
[99:52] in the for over six years so that this
[99:55] was like a really big security and then
[99:56] of a sudden income to zero almost zero
[100:00] and yeah like a few months ago I think
[100:03] two months ago it was where I hit the
[100:06] amount uh I I make now more than I made
[100:08] before with my job uh which was crazy
[100:11] for me I mean if you look at an hourly
[100:13] basis I make less because it work so
[100:14] much more than before but uh on like a
[100:18] full on basis it's it's great I never
[100:21] had problems all with paying uh my bills
[100:24] uh over that period of time and never
[100:25] had to I was prepared for two years to
[100:28] live off my Bitcoin savings I was like
[100:30] [ __ ] it I will just do it um but I never
[100:33] had to do that actually which why was it
[100:35] worth it to you to do that how why were
[100:37] you willing to dip into your Bitcoin
[100:39] savings to make this a thing happen when
[100:42] you had I mean it sounds like you me you
[100:45] haven't mentioned your your job in a
[100:47] negative light did you dislike it were
[100:50] there abely not that like that that was
[100:52] that's why it was so hard because I
[100:54] liked what I was doing um you like the
[100:57] people I like the people I like what was
[100:59] I doing the only thing that did not like
[101:01] is it security it security was not my
[101:04] thing I wasn't passionate about it but
[101:06] but the job was good and everything like
[101:08] that so if it would would be Bitcoin I
[101:09] would still be working there uh probably
[101:12] there would have never been a podcast if
[101:13] that company would have done Bitcoin um
[101:16] but I really there was there was just
[101:20] one clip and it just like uh triggered
[101:23] me and it never went out of my head uh
[101:25] and he said something like you can fail
[101:27] at something that you you don't like so
[101:30] why not take the chance on something you
[101:33] like and it made like it was a nice
[101:35] story uh I have no clue who was in that
[101:38] clip even but it was like a very short
[101:40] clip on on I think YouTube or something
[101:42] like that and it it stuck stuck with me
[101:44] and then I got that opportunity and I
[101:46] was like like maybe I should just try it
[101:49] like it was not a logical decision it
[101:51] was just an emotional thing where I'm
[101:52] like oh like that that could turn into
[101:55] something and also there's like this
[101:57] Green Cross thing uh if you
[102:00] see um the podcasting world and and you
[102:03] you you come home and you you do the
[102:05] podcast and and you really like it like
[102:07] you're like that feels really good like
[102:09] I just talked to Chef Bo like how
[102:10] amazing was that and you see the green
[102:13] grass over at the neighbors all of a
[102:15] sudden the grass that that is with you
[102:17] all of a sudden like I don't know maybe
[102:19] maybe I don't like it that much uh and
[102:21] then you like you the jump is easier uh
[102:25] but yeah it was a really hard decision
[102:26] because I was I was happy with with with
[102:28] what I have I definitely had the um goal
[102:33] of making some money with my social
[102:35] media because I was like I put I put in
[102:37] 2023 um at least two hours every day
[102:41] into Twitter uh growing it from like 200
[102:44] followers uh to 7,000 now I'm like
[102:47] almost at
[102:48] 177,000 uh so I put a lot of uh a lot of
[102:52] hours in there and I did not get a
[102:54] single single Satoshi for that last year
[102:57] so I I had this as a goal for mine to
[103:00] make some money with that and I had even
[103:03] numbers for that for the end of the year
[103:05] I blew them completely out of the way uh
[103:09] obviously from the revenue thing that
[103:10] Twitter now pays out is that what you're
[103:12] talking about ye uh yes but this is a
[103:15] small like this was my goal of like
[103:18] making it with that but that doesn't pay
[103:20] well I think I get from Twitter what is
[103:22] it
[103:23] 30 or $40 per two weeks so may maybe are
[103:28] you talking about through YouTube or
[103:30] what where are you talking about the
[103:31] that you the goal that you had from from
[103:33] where the the goal was that I blow up my
[103:37] Twitter ad Revenue oh I see the numbers
[103:39] the followers you have I got you I see I
[103:41] see so that was the goal uh and uh I
[103:45] didn't get the revenue from Twitter that
[103:47] I hoped for uh but I get it got it from
[103:50] like sponsorships and and from YouTube
[103:52] ad Revenue I see I see gotcha but yeah
[103:56] uh was was amazing to talk to you again
[103:59] um I I slowly have to end the podcast
[104:02] because I just realized I have 50
[104:04] minutes and you next recording
[104:07] okay how many you do in a
[104:09] day usually usually one or two maximum
[104:13] okay uh but right now I'm just so much
[104:16] um traveling uh on conferences and with
[104:20] the family uh that I do today threee uh
[104:23] and uh that's my maximum uh two I like
[104:27] two the most two two with like half an
[104:30] hour an hour in between is the best
[104:32] because the first is like really nice
[104:34] you ramp up your energy and the second
[104:35] you have really good energy and with the
[104:37] third it's it's a similar than the first
[104:41] four is too much never do four podcast
[104:43] you're just like your brain is not
[104:44] working anymore like four is too much uh
[104:48] it's it's you you are fried you like ah
[104:52] I don't want anymore
[104:54] more uh but yeah free free is okay
[104:57] you're my first today okay all right I'm
[104:59] the warm-up
[105:02] session definitely not definitely not
[105:04] really cool um uh I had I had one more
[105:08] question maybe you can answer that
[105:09] quickly do you think micro strategy has
[105:11] a chance of being the the biggest
[105:13] company on Earth sure yeah it's got a
[105:19] chance I was of course
[105:23] how how how high is the chance oh
[105:27] God
[105:30] I I 10%
[105:34] 15% decent but not not great and the
[105:37] reason I say that is because all it
[105:39] takes is another company to add Bitcoin
[105:41] to their balance sheet while continuing
[105:43] to do whatever they do it's like it it's
[105:45] not as
[105:47] though I don't think that if apple or
[105:49] Microsoft like if sailor goes and talks
[105:51] to Microsoft and they start adding
[105:53] Bitcoin to their balance sheet that
[105:55] suddenly it drives the price of Bitcoin
[105:57] so high that it propels micro strategy
[106:00] Beyond like they they just Leap Frog
[106:02] above all these other companies I think
[106:04] these other companies are still going to
[106:05] be valued really high because of what
[106:07] they're doing it's not suddenly oh
[106:09] Microsoft is worth3 trillion do on the
[106:12] balance sheet but now that they've added
[106:15] Bitcoin we're going to look at them
[106:17] completely differently so now they're
[106:19] only worth $80 billion like I it's it's
[106:22] going to supplement what they do but
[106:25] that they have these other revenue
[106:27] streams and are doing other things I
[106:28] think it'll help them I don't think it
[106:30] would hurt them so it would just boost
[106:33] them it'd be like Rocket Fuel onto a or
[106:35] I don't know like Fast and the Furious
[106:37] hitting the NOS button I think and so
[106:39] that still keeps them ahead of micro
[106:41] strategy I I think what micro strategy
[106:43] has to do to really climb up and I don't
[106:47] know that they would at this point given
[106:48] that their core principles but I think
[106:50] they have to do something else like
[106:53] I I don't know come out with a they've
[106:55] got this whole software business like
[106:56] come out with they've talked about being
[106:58] able to send lightning payments via
[106:59] email talk to Google integrate that with
[107:02] Gmail like find a way or make your own
[107:04] email app where lightning is part of it
[107:06] where hey we offer this new go back to
[107:09] the the basics of Bitcoin and add him
[107:10] back what he was trying to do with with
[107:12] the the payment come out with an email
[107:15] that's a competitor Gmail that promises
[107:17] no spam ever again because now you have
[107:20] to do this whole lightning thing and if
[107:22] you want like come out with a competitor
[107:24] to that like you've got a software
[107:25] business you got the people there that
[107:27] come up come up with these things you've
[107:28] got Bitcoin like make some interesting
[107:31] products for
[107:32] us that that's a a big part of it yeah
[107:35] it's also probably like the the longer
[107:39] CEOs don't get what Bitcoin is the
[107:41] higher the chance of micro strategy
[107:43] actually being the biggest one uh is so
[107:46] like Michael zor has an incentive to
[107:49] shut up about
[107:51] Bitcoin yeah if that's his I don't know
[107:53] that that his goal is to be the biggest
[107:54] company maybe it is I I don't know like
[107:57] my brother asked me he said oh what do
[107:58] you think sailor's goal is a million
[108:00] Bitcoin and I haven't responded to it
[108:02] yet but I was thinking I don't think he
[108:03] has a number I think it's just as much
[108:05] as I can possibly get until I it's
[108:07] beyond the capability like if I can keep
[108:09] on raising money and selling these
[108:11] different bonds and things to Wall
[108:13] Street to buy more Bitcoin I'm just
[108:14] going to keep on doing that in
[108:15] perpetuity like I don't think there's a
[108:16] number where he goes all right there we
[108:17] go we made it that's it stop I don't see
[108:20] that I I think I think he he said that
[108:24] in the first in the first couple of
[108:25] interviews where he got that formo all
[108:28] of the sudden of like oh like every
[108:29] every company will figure that out
[108:31] really quickly now yeah uh so I think
[108:33] he's already surprised by by how many
[108:36] Bitcoin he was able to accumulate I
[108:38] think he's really surprised how big the
[108:40] number got uh when if you would have
[108:42] asked him in the beginning oh how many
[108:44] Bitcoin do you think you can accumulate
[108:46] I think he would have not never said
[108:48] like such a huge amount of number so
[108:51] yeah maybe he can get to a million but
[108:53] it will be a hard hard way like it's a
[108:55] long way for like from 300,000 or
[108:57] something like that he has to like a
[108:58] million that's that needs some uh some
[109:02] feat games he has to do there yeah it's
[109:05] it's ever harder every
[109:06] day absolutely perfect then we have uh
[109:09] one question that asked every each and
[109:11] every one of my guests what can we learn
[109:13] from you besides Bitcoin well I
[109:16] mentioned that I wanted to write a book
[109:18] the last time I was on here and I had
[109:20] this whole book thought out but it was
[109:22] the world was looking down the barrel of
[109:24] a shotgun at the time as far as I could
[109:26] tell it was a very different feeling we
[109:29] didn't know what was going to happen at
[109:30] least in the US as far as the election
[109:32] things things were felt a lot darker
[109:34] then and at least for dependent on who
[109:36] you talk to these days but for them it
[109:38] feels a lot darker but for me it feels a
[109:40] lot brighter for bitcoiners it feels a
[109:42] lot brighter I think and I I'm going to
[109:47] I I've started it I've actually RR wrote
[109:50] the opening twice now but it probably be
[109:52] another time but I'm I'm writing a
[109:54] fiction book it it's it it's a
[109:58] fictionalized story of my life and my
[110:01] wife and how we found Bitcoin and how we
[110:03] didn't have a whole lot of hope I
[110:05] wouldn't say we were nihilist by any
[110:06] means but it was just sort of like well
[110:08] this is our lot in life we're going to
[110:09] be relatively not poor not destitute not
[110:12] homeless but not wealthy like lower
[110:15] middle class I guess certainly on the
[110:17] low end of that and this is our lot in
[110:19] life and I guess we're just going to
[110:20] kind of make the best of it as we can
[110:22] and that does not include a family it
[110:24] does not include children but then after
[110:26] finding Bitcoin all of that changed and
[110:29] we decided that we would try to have
[110:30] children and it it is because of Bitcoin
[110:34] that that happened and so it's it's a
[110:36] story with the the core of it is Hope
[110:39] and like Bitcoin and changing can can
[110:43] change your entire perspective so if you
[110:45] want to read that that that'll come I
[110:47] don't know how I'm going to publish it I
[110:49] don't I don't know what that's going to
[110:50] look like because writing a a
[110:53] book arguably is the easiest part of
[110:56] getting a book done the hardest part is
[110:59] all of the other stuff that comes after
[111:01] like finding an editor finding this and
[111:03] that that's not free all of that costs
[111:04] money like a lot of money like thousands
[111:07] of dollars money it is not inexpensive
[111:10] to just get your book out there and that
[111:12] hoping that it turns a profit as well
[111:14] okay good luck with that so it's it's
[111:18] one of those things where you hope it
[111:21] does like I I I I would hope that it
[111:23] breaks even but yeah I I I have my own
[111:26] podcast Channel I'm sorry it's not a
[111:28] podcast it's it's just like me random
[111:30] rants that I do when I have a thought
[111:32] it's got 120 subscribers if it had less
[111:35] I would be happy like I I'm not trying
[111:36] to do anything with it other than share
[111:38] thoughts it's more of a therapy for me
[111:41] like I have a thought I'm just going to
[111:42] rant for a bit so if somebody wants to
[111:44] ask a question and hear me explain it
[111:46] through my own
[111:48] Wackadoo way then yeah you can check out
[111:51] it's just my name
[111:54] um absolutely you still do the question
[111:56] thing for the next guest yes I I still
[111:59] do that uh so your qu like the the last
[112:03] question last guest even gave me an an
[112:05] an optionality of of different questions
[112:08] which was really I think the first time
[112:10] ever someone did that and the most
[112:12] interesting one out of those three
[112:14] questions he gave me was what year do
[112:17] you think will be the first
[112:18] International oil trade settled in
[112:20] Bitcoin very specific
[112:25] yeah I don't I don't even know enough
[112:27] about that to ask to answer that
[112:30] I I 20
[112:32] 27
[112:35] maybe I have nothing to back that I've
[112:38] got no reason besides that's a date in
[112:40] the future the the other question was uh
[112:43] I will just ask that uh bits or SATs oh
[112:47] SATs the whole bits thing I mean maybe
[112:49] eventually when we start using it as as
[112:52] a currency and and you want it then I
[112:54] think there will be others just like you
[112:55] have 10 cents and five like dollars and
[112:58] $510 but sure maybe but no
[113:01] sads perfect yeah thank you so much uh
