[00:00] we stop everything literally every
[00:01] project no income 3 months we just build
[00:04] whatever we can build and then we
[00:06] release it was quite exhausting and
[00:08] intense our son was born in June 27 2020
[00:11] and July the 1st we just released relay
[00:14] today 3 and a half years later we are 21
[00:17] full-time employees and and killing it
[00:20] you recommend to everybody having a
[00:22] technical co-founder it's like it's like
[00:25] a marriage this worked out really well
[00:26] with my wife as well don't try to find
[00:29] someone that is exactly like you try to
[00:31] find someone who is filling in the part
[00:33] that you're missing well what the
[00:35] question oh you put it so well Rich
[00:38] literally something that they would be
[00:39] killing you you will not sleep you will
[00:42] feel terrible you would just do whatever
[00:44] it takes to to get it out what has to
[00:46] happen on the on the Bitcoin layers the
[00:49] more layers you have the more being
[00:51] noncustodial becomes
[00:53] challenging you were a developer and a
[00:56] Founder uh before reala you did
[00:59] something with blockchain projects uh
[01:01] also they have some some tokens even um
[01:05] how did you find your way to bitcoin and
[01:07] even to a Bitcoin only exchange yeah I
[01:09] think this had a big impact on me
[01:11] finding the the right way because I
[01:14] could see exactly what was happening in
[01:16] these projects so I I was a developer so
[01:22] um I got into the I heard about the
[01:25] blockchain obviously I heard about
[01:27] Bitcoin first and at the same time the
[01:29] blockchain techn techology so I was
[01:31] really into the the tech
[01:33] initially and I
[01:36] realized there was really a lot of
[01:39] issues for these projects to reach Mass
[01:42] adoption Mass adoption meaning that I
[01:44] was so excited about crypto currencies
[01:46] in general that I thought you know what
[01:48] it's a Pity that not a lot of people can
[01:51] use it and for me the bottleneck was
[01:54] user experience so they all had to have
[01:58] a proper Mobile Wallet and I was just
[02:00] working on mobile platforms and I
[02:02] combined both so I was implementing
[02:05] mobile wallets for different crypto
[02:08] projects and there it's relatively small
[02:10] teams uh one was even less than 10
[02:14] another one was a bit bigger but you
[02:16] could already see the the human factor
[02:20] the impact that this crypto projects are
[02:25] not to me they're not solving any
[02:29] Financial
[02:30] aspect they are here they are
[02:32] interesting in terms of Technology
[02:34] because some of them really bring some
[02:37] novelty um but most of them are just
[02:40] technology startup I rather call them
[02:43] startup they're not really crypto
[02:45] projects for me and if anyone wants to
[02:48] invest in their token or whatever they
[02:51] should consider this as investing in a
[02:53] startup more than investing in a
[02:56] coin and in this small relatively small
[02:59] project you can clearly see that taking
[03:01] a decision is a matter of a few minutes
[03:05] of discussion and then you take a new
[03:07] decision so all of a sudden all the
[03:10] people who invested in this coin they
[03:13] depend on the on on on this decisions
[03:18] that will be taken in in a in in a
[03:20] meeting that they are not even part of
[03:21] it so there's really not there is no
[03:23] proper
[03:24] consensus there is it really goes super
[03:27] fast it's like oh yeah this is cool
[03:29] let's do this and then all of a sudden
[03:30] you see it implemented without being
[03:32] able to you know take the time to think
[03:35] about its impact and you just take
[03:38] decision on behalf of all these
[03:40] users this is where Bitcoin is
[03:43] completely different that's the only one
[03:46] where there is literally no CEO right
[03:48] all the other crypto projects they have
[03:50] a CEO most of them they have
[03:53] investors so there is really the the
[03:56] human impact that I really don't like
[03:58] because as a human being we are easily
[04:02] biased and this is what you don't have
[04:04] in Bitcoin so I mean obviously there are
[04:07] still humans taking decisions but there
[04:08] is a consensus there is no marketing
[04:11] department nobody is really trying to to
[04:14] bring Bitcoin to the top or the top as
[04:17] in um not not the price but just in
[04:20] front of more people just because they
[04:23] just they need to hear about it there is
[04:25] a lot history historically speaking
[04:28] physic philosophically speaking behind
[04:31] Bitcoin that you don't have in all these
[04:32] other projects did U because you just
[04:36] mentioned it um reala is a VC company
[04:40] like you have venture capital investment
[04:42] you did not take the route of uh
[04:45] launching a token or uh doing something
[04:49] like that um could could this token
[04:52] launching and disrupt kind of the VC
[04:55] Market or the the stock market even or
[04:59] will will there always be like
[05:02] traditional investors and kind of a
[05:05] stock market investors how do you see
[05:07] that founding a company in maybe like
[05:11] 2040 yeah actually we we are we take
[05:15] care obviously of whoever is joining
[05:17] really as an investor we we don't just
[05:20] take anyone because they're bringing in
[05:21] money obviously this is very important
[05:25] from day one it's all the the culture
[05:28] the vision of a startup this has to be
[05:30] shared across the whole board and not
[05:32] board as in as in uh as in the board
[05:35] members but the whole team whoever is
[05:37] part of relay and this also applies to
[05:40] the users obviously this is something we
[05:42] want to share and make sure that
[05:43] everybody can is on the same page so it
[05:47] is important from the beginning and um
[05:50] it is important that we have V's on
[05:52] board that knows about Bitcoin they know
[05:56] exactly how it works they are in for the
[05:58] long game
[06:00] and we don't want anyone on board that
[06:02] will be like two years we know that the
[06:04] Visas we have on board two years later
[06:05] they will not come in and say oh what
[06:07] about this other token for them it's
[06:10] clear from day one look guys we're
[06:11] Bitcoin only this is what we are if
[06:13] you're not interested if this is already
[06:14] not a check for you then please uh do
[06:17] you have plenty of other options out
[06:19] there unfortunately in our last round we
[06:22] also had uh EOD joining us which is a
[06:25] Bitcoin only VC so um at the time when
[06:29] we Lou we were still too small and I
[06:31] think the the environment was not that
[06:33] much like there were not so much Bitcoin
[06:35] only VCS around especially for this uh
[06:39] type of um startup it was really early
[06:42] stage but now we have the luxury of
[06:44] having also Bitcoin only VCS uh out
[06:47] there and uh and even have them on on
[06:50] board now uh with time chain concentric
[06:53] all of this really they know what
[06:55] they're talking about they know this is
[06:57] Bitcoin and uh we don't need to worry
[06:59] about this but then for other projects
[07:02] it's obviously they are investing in in
[07:04] a startup that they want to bring in
[07:07] more the only way they can really make
[07:09] money is bringing on some new coin or
[07:11] some new token uh that might hopefully
[07:15] make it somehow yeah it's it's
[07:18] impressive uh staying at the Bitcoin
[07:20] only link now there are some few
[07:23] examples uh with rela with 21 Bitcoin
[07:25] with coin Infinity like there are a lot
[07:27] of Bitcoin only Exchange is now out
[07:30] there but resisting the I say to it the
[07:34] shitcoin casino money because I think uh
[07:37] having a lot of shitcoins on the
[07:39] exchange and I saw it with one the first
[07:41] exchange I used was Bon it was a German
[07:45] exchange uh and they were at the
[07:48] beginning just like five tokens and it
[07:51] was okay for me and at that time I was
[07:53] also in ethereum uh but then I
[07:56] completely changed away from from beon I
[07:59] also made like a a really wild tweet
[08:01] with like what exchange should I use and
[08:03] there was like alsoa and 21 Bitcoin in
[08:06] there like we had a lot of exchanges
[08:08] there but um they brought up more and
[08:11] more shitcoins and they're now I think
[08:13] even now bringing in more and more of
[08:15] this Shino I remember seeing that
[08:18] message on my my phone seeing like oh we
[08:22] now have Shino invest now your first
[08:24] like it was so I was like this this
[08:27] should not be on my phone I I don't want
[08:28] that yeah but how like I think it's just
[08:33] impressive that Rel could withstand that
[08:35] that that seduction of of of U having
[08:39] that money stream not how is it from an
[08:42] economical bu standpoint has it uh
[08:47] advantages besides the E ethnical
[08:50] advantages uh having Bitcoin only
[08:54] exchain it has both I mean obviously a
[08:57] lot of advantages and and and as you
[08:59] said maybe a few disadvantages as well
[09:02] so maybe starting with the disadvantages
[09:04] because they're very obvious and you
[09:05] mentioned them it's it's easy money it's
[09:09] just like if you are bringing
[09:13] in x uh with all Bitcoin only you can
[09:18] bring two x if you add this other crypto
[09:20] and three x if you add three more and
[09:22] four x if you had four more it's just
[09:24] it's just easy math right and this is
[09:26] what anyone would do it's like yeah but
[09:29] if you're already it is working so well
[09:31] with Bitcoin just add a few more and
[09:33] this will double triple whatever your
[09:36] revenues and and fortunately this is
[09:39] nothing close to what we thought from
[09:41] the beginning it was very clear for us
[09:44] and it's also very good because it's
[09:45] good to start with a niche it it helps
[09:48] you
[09:48] focus I think that's what we are very
[09:51] good at being focused on just one thing
[09:53] and being the best at it and this helps
[09:55] this is this is true for for whatever uh
[09:58] company St startup out there not only in
[10:01] the the financial sector but wherever
[10:02] you are you cannot just start trying to
[10:05] reach out to everybody even if you want
[10:07] it to we never want it anyway and and
[10:10] the other way the the biggest Advantage
[10:12] is whoever is on board really knows what
[10:17] they're talking about and this is such a
[10:21] a strength that you don't realize until
[10:24] until you get there right
[10:26] having every team member being purely on
[10:30] bitcoin having VCS Bitcoin only VCS
[10:33] having users that are just CBS and and
[10:36] really the only thing they want is is is
[10:39] Bitcoin and Bitcoin only and the the
[10:42] feedback you get from them the the
[10:44] support you get from them is nowhere
[10:46] close to what you would get from a more
[10:48] broad uh mass or a broad user base or a
[10:52] broad V's there you will only get a
[10:54] little bit from here a little bit from
[10:56] there but here there is such a strong
[10:59] signal and you can't get this anywhere
[11:00] else and this signal is important
[11:02] because that's what keeps us alive
[11:05] that's what you know it's this drive
[11:07] that when you wake up every morning you
[11:09] want to get to somewhere you want to
[11:10] reach somewhere and you want to do
[11:12] whatever it takes to to to to reach out
[11:15] to this to this school and this you will
[11:16] not get in more generic or shitcoin
[11:19] casinos because obviously you don't care
[11:21] okay Shibu what's next and every day you
[11:23] add one more you add one more you lose
[11:26] the whole interest there's nothing it
[11:28] just becomes some sort of of a machine
[11:31] where by clicking a button you just keep
[11:32] adding more you lose really what are you
[11:35] even doing I mean it's fine if you're in
[11:38] for the money just do it but but you
[11:41] also have all this responsibility with
[11:43] all this this users you're putting a lot
[11:45] of people at risk it just doesn't make
[11:47] any sense and I know for a fact that uh
[11:51] I I couldn't work in any project like
[11:53] this I couldn't handle it and I would
[11:56] have left already a while ago yeah I
[11:59] also think that's a big um um a big
[12:03] factor in for the next like couple of
[12:05] years because I think over the years
[12:08] Bitcoin only will be more and more
[12:11] obvious to everybody and also to Talent
[12:14] like there will be uh software
[12:15] developers there will be uh skilled
[12:18] marketing uh people there will be
[12:21] podcasters for example I only take
[12:23] Bitcoin only people on like if they if I
[12:25] see in the biyo anything else or in any
[12:28] reads anything else um I I just don't do
[12:33] it with them and there are more and more
[12:35] podcasts coming out there are more and
[12:36] more influences coming out that are
[12:37] Bitcoin only like I think at some point
[12:40] uh it will be even a liability to have
[12:42] anything else than Bitcoin on uh on the
[12:47] exchange on on on the
[12:50] portfolio um but it's still a really
[12:53] impressive uh thing to do maybe let's
[12:55] let's take a step back uh how did you
[12:57] find Julie and how did the whole
[13:00] founding story of Rel
[13:03] go yeah sure um so this one we we met
[13:07] first online so you know as I said I was
[13:10] working on this different um with these
[13:12] different crypto projects implementing
[13:13] wallets and all and I remember joining
[13:16] the in in
[13:18] Switzerland um crypto in general and and
[13:21] Bitcoin is very strong so there is a
[13:23] strong Community there is a city called
[13:26] Suk which is also called the crypto
[13:28] Valley that's where all the the crypto
[13:30] projects they have their Foundation
[13:32] their Association whatever because
[13:34] legally speaking for legislation and
[13:36] everything it's really easy so in terms
[13:39] of uh uh Bitcoin and crypto Switzerland
[13:42] has been always very very strong and
[13:44] there is a Swiss Bitcoin Association but
[13:46] I just joined the telegram Channel and I
[13:48] just introduced myself this was end of
[13:51] 2018 and and straight straight away just
[13:55] Julian reached out he was like oh um by
[13:57] the way I want to do this for uh for
[13:59] Bitcoin like whatever you do like an
[14:01] easy wallet an easy onboarding
[14:03] offboarding for for
[14:04] Bitcoin and then I was like yeah sure
[14:07] but Bitcoin is already very easy you
[14:09] know I was coming from these crypto
[14:11] projects where technically they're
[14:12] really challenging like you need really
[14:15] to to put a lot of efforts in bringing
[14:17] it to mobile it was very complicated and
[14:20] I was like Bitcoin is easy there are a
[14:21] lot of wallets out there and all of this
[14:23] and then he convinced me that it's not
[14:26] easy but obviously I was biased I'm
[14:28] coming from from the tech world and I am
[14:31] a geek so I know exactly how Bitcoin
[14:33] Works creating a wallet sending
[14:34] receiving has always been easy but I was
[14:36] a bit behind my just my computer nobody
[14:39] in my family was interested in Bitcoin
[14:41] and all but it was the opposite for him
[14:43] his family was interested and they were
[14:45] asking him oh I want to get into Bitcoin
[14:46] I just
[14:47] count and at the time it was all the the
[14:50] the the the kyc craziness with the
[14:53] pictures and you know you have to hold
[14:54] this name board and I want to register
[14:57] to your platform
[14:59] and you had to on board in a few
[15:01] different exchanges if you really wanted
[15:02] to get it to work you had to hold and
[15:05] board like I know the the process where
[15:07] you have to like swipe your hands before
[15:09] and stuff like that but the board you
[15:11] have to hold w a board was it was a
[15:13] paper you had to write your first name
[15:15] last name the date and you had to take a
[15:17] picture like this and this was the the
[15:20] old kyc processes and to to send it to
[15:22] different uh uh platforms but every time
[15:25] you had to renew it because I think you
[15:26] had the name of the platform in the the
[15:28] picture so you couldn't reuse it um but
[15:31] but that was quite uh quite cumbersome I
[15:35] mean it was not easy you didn't want to
[15:37] go through all of this and he convinced
[15:39] me I was like yeah actually you're right
[15:41] and um and that's how it all started so
[15:45] January 2019 and then for a year a bit
[15:48] more than a year it was on and off we
[15:50] both had our own still projects on going
[15:53] so we didn't really put a 100% of our
[15:56] energy there we did a hackaton that was
[15:58] the first time where we put some code
[16:01] together where we had the first MVP of
[16:03] of a mobile app very ugly but still it
[16:06] was something that we we started with
[16:08] and then we we also talked to a few um
[16:12] investors mostly Angel Investors even
[16:14] v's and we always had the same message
[16:17] they were like look if you're not
[16:18] putting 200% of your time and your
[16:20] efforts in your own project there is no
[16:23] way I'm going to put any money in that
[16:25] one because it looks like even you don't
[16:27] believe in your project if you don't put
[16:29] all your efforts in your own project and
[16:31] we're like yeah well they're right so we
[16:34] we decided to to stop everything we just
[16:36] needed a bit of money to to pay the
[16:38] bills at the end of the month because if
[16:40] we stop everything and we don't have any
[16:42] money well we need something still to
[16:44] pay the bills and Julian was just going
[16:47] through you know different CH different
[16:49] challenges different uh competitions for
[16:51] startups and all to try to get a bit of
[16:54] money and then we these two Angel
[16:56] Investors he could raise like I think it
[16:58] was 15K 15 uh 15,000 Swiss Franks and
[17:03] that's all we got to put something out
[17:05] so we said okay you know what we stop
[17:07] everything literally every project no
[17:09] income we just uh Focus three months
[17:12] that was what we agreed on three months
[17:14] we just build whatever we can build and
[17:17] then we release it we started April the
[17:19] 1st so it's it's not it's not a joke we
[17:22] relas start started April the 1st so
[17:24] every year April the 1 is oh did we
[17:26] relase start on April the 1st why did we
[17:27] do that so 2020 and we said in July
[17:32] beginning of July whatever is there we
[17:34] just release it and it was only Julian
[17:36] and me I was the only one coding and he
[17:39] was the one handling all the rest like
[17:41] marketing like business whatever and
[17:44] this worked out really well because I
[17:45] really needed to be just be cing all my
[17:49] whole time I don't want to and this was
[17:51] what I'm really the best at and he was
[17:53] managing the rest very
[17:55] well and and this turned out to be very
[17:57] good it was quite exhausting and intense
[18:01] H we were also having our first baby so
[18:03] he was born in June 27th oh our son was
[18:07] born in June 27 2020 and July the 1st we
[18:11] just released relay so um they're both
[18:14] they are both the same age and I always
[18:17] like to joke that I have two babies
[18:18] actually one is Rel and one is one is my
[18:21] son with the same age with the exactly
[18:24] the same age I think they're like three
[18:25] four days they are apart and I don't
[18:29] know how I did it you know it's just the
[18:31] the whole hype and everything it's like
[18:33] uh it was really really tough and
[18:35] especially at the beginning it's tough
[18:36] you really want to put a lot of efforts
[18:37] there and at the same time you have this
[18:40] human being this little baby at home who
[18:42] and it's it's our first so you don't
[18:43] really know how to handle it so yeah it
[18:46] was it was quite intense but uh but very
[18:48] happy we did it this was really the way
[18:49] to go we had a deadline whatever happens
[18:52] it had to be out and July the 1st we
[18:55] just released the first version 2020 and
[18:58] and today three and a half years later
[19:01] we are 21 full-time employees and and
[19:04] killing it so I'm really happy that we
[19:06] we did that move there are two things
[19:08] standing out for me like the first that
[19:10] you you had the foresight and put
[19:13] yourself a deadline like I think a lot
[19:15] of projects start and they're like oh
[19:17] let's try a few things and then let's
[19:19] push it out and they're never giving
[19:21] them like okay this day I'm starting out
[19:24] and the second thing is that you
[19:25] actually um really completely had two
[19:30] roles with the the technical role and
[19:32] everything else handling um and you also
[19:35] tweeted I saw it in your timeline that
[19:37] you tweeted out um that you recommend to
[19:40] everybody having a technical co-founder
[19:43] and also if you're technical having a a
[19:47] partner that's not non- techical that's
[19:50] economically
[19:51] um how did this help and why are you
[19:54] recommending to to do this like that way
[19:59] yeah this this helped a lot this helped
[20:01] like tremendously and the two points
[20:03] that you mentioned both were very
[20:05] important and so the first one about the
[20:07] deadline as you said and here I may be
[20:10] talking to developers more because this
[20:12] is like like a I don't want to call it a
[20:14] disease but this is an issue we have as
[20:17] developers we we we have a lot of I have
[20:20] a temporary folder in my Mac somewhere
[20:22] where I still have a lot of projects
[20:24] that I never released it's both the the
[20:27] fear of being in front of all these
[20:29] users all at once and it's also the the
[20:33] perfectionism that is uh hitting us
[20:36] there and every day you know it's been
[20:39] three and a half years at relay we have
[20:41] a killer team a developer team and a
[20:43] marketing team and like we are really
[20:45] killing it and it's still not perfect
[20:47] because it will never be perfect and if
[20:50] I had to wait for oh wait Julian I still
[20:54] need to implement this oh by the way
[20:56] let's wait for for to Route oh let's
[20:58] let's wait for this let's wait for that
[21:00] we would have never released it and this
[21:03] came from from julan he was like no you
[21:05] know what July the first we release
[21:07] whatever happens because this is this is
[21:10] something we struggle with a lot as a
[21:12] developers it it's our baby we want it
[21:14] to be perfect there is and the problem
[21:17] is there is always something you can
[21:18] work on always literally and at some
[21:22] point you need to stop and to get it out
[21:23] there so uh there is a saying just ship
[21:26] it just ship it it will never be perfect
[21:28] and you will always need to work on it
[21:30] so that's the first part and the other
[21:31] part is I mean
[21:34] obviously both of us could do it
[21:37] separately I could just go out do a
[21:39] business course a marketing course and
[21:41] then just get out and implement it and
[21:43] put it out there or Julian could have
[21:45] done the same he could have learned a
[21:47] bit about programming and get it out
[21:49] there right but but anyways starting
[21:52] something like this is already time
[21:54] consuming energy consuming and
[21:58] you cannot be the best at at many things
[22:02] at everything and here what works out
[22:05] really good is that look I'm the best at
[22:07] programming and you're killing it it was
[22:10] not his first startup anyway in the
[22:11] financial sector he already had two
[22:13] before and you're the best as killing it
[22:15] like whatever is business related and
[22:18] networking and and going out looking for
[22:20] for funding looking for VCS and and
[22:23] doing the marketing initially until we
[22:25] got some some marketing department and
[22:27] this is this is the core team and the
[22:29] core team you need you need the two
[22:33] members to bring in whatever they can
[22:35] it's it's like it's like a marriage so
[22:39] and this worked out really well with my
[22:40] wife as well we are very different with
[22:43] my wife we're almost the opposite she is
[22:45] an introvert no I am the introvert she
[22:48] is the extrovert she likes to do things
[22:50] like completely unplanned and on the
[22:52] spot I'm like no no no if it's not in my
[22:54] calendar I'm not doing it there is no
[22:55] way but then together it just makes it
[22:59] just happens to be that super strong
[23:01] team because Sheen brings on the table
[23:04] what I cannot this is exactly the same
[23:06] with with Julian he really extrovert he
[23:10] likes to go out to talk to a lot of
[23:11] people and I'm like you know what just
[23:13] just give a computer I'm in front of my
[23:15] computer I'm very comfortable let me
[23:17] just do this and and I'm really good at
[23:19] it and and I can bring this uh to the
[23:21] world much much faster if at the same
[23:24] time you can focus on the other parties
[23:27] that are all very iCal for a startup so
[23:29] that's why I recommend and it's also the
[23:31] fact that you're not alone because alone
[23:34] you lose track of a lot of things alone
[23:37] you lose track of deadlines you don't
[23:40] have any like you don't have anyone you
[23:43] depend on you're you're not promising
[23:45] anyone that you will be uh delivering
[23:48] and and then you're just like well
[23:50] whatever what if I don't release on July
[23:52] the 1st nobody cares right I can wait
[23:54] for August it's summer time let's just
[23:57] go take take some break and then I will
[23:59] come back energized and then I will
[24:01] release it so so it gets very very
[24:04] tricky and it also gets even for
[24:06] celebration I mean when you want to
[24:08] celebrate something you want to be
[24:09] together to party together and not alone
[24:11] so all in all it makes a lot of sense to
[24:14] have anyway co-founder a team and to be
[24:18] a team you need to be more than one and
[24:21] they have to be complimentary
[24:22] complimentary is the keyword here don't
[24:25] try to find someone that is exactly like
[24:27] you
[24:28] this won't help I mean especially for a
[24:31] starter this will not help try to find
[24:33] someone who is filling in the part that
[24:36] you're
[24:38] missing that's or the parts that you're
[24:40] missing in in plural because you might
[24:42] be missing a few and it doesn't have to
[24:43] be only one person it can be two or
[24:45] three still keep it limited because then
[24:48] you have other challenges when it's too
[24:49] big but that's why I think a core team
[24:52] and complimentary team is very important
[24:55] and when we are now looking back like
[24:57] you really is now going on for we you're
[25:01] in the fourth year right um I saw a post
[25:05] of yours of the Diary of a CEO picture
[25:09] with Cason and I by the way love that
[25:13] podcast and also saw that that episode
[25:15] with with Casey um and you posted like
[25:18] uh that Casey said I would never do a
[25:20] software company and you said you don't
[25:23] have to leave it to me um what's your
[25:26] what's your biggest learning from like
[25:28] having Rel as an CTO as a Founder what
[25:32] what did you learn about software
[25:33] developing companies that provide
[25:36] services for for so many many
[25:40] people well what the
[25:44] question yeah well it there is so much
[25:47] to say I wouldn't know I wouldn't know
[25:49] where to start to be honest so um I
[25:51] really love that podcast as well and
[25:53] Casey was like you know what you guys
[25:55] this is not something I can do and also
[25:57] goes back to what I mentioned earlier
[26:00] you know there's always something you're
[26:01] very good at and it makes sense to just
[26:03] focus on that I'm not saying that KY is
[26:06] bad at at doing a company a software
[26:08] development company but he is the first
[26:10] name that comes to your mind whenever
[26:12] anyone says Vlog right oh K aat and and
[26:16] this guy has just been like it's
[26:18] fabulous what he's been doing and and
[26:20] that's what he wanted to bring in as
[26:22] well like the the challenges that are
[26:23] there as a software development company
[26:25] are are out of his expertise and he
[26:28] wasn't expecting all of this and and he
[26:31] made it he was also very successful but
[26:33] I can understand that all all these
[26:35] challenges he had he was not prepared
[26:36] for them and and and and he ended up
[26:39] like being saying something like this
[26:41] and it was funny hearing him say that so
[26:44] for me it's
[26:46] like I used I used to work scaling was a
[26:49] big problem I used to work alone for for
[26:51] quiet some time and and when you work
[26:54] alone you try to be efficient you try to
[26:57] to be fast without always thinking long
[27:01] term you know you just want to get the
[27:04] the work the job out and you're like
[27:06] okay well this is what I did and I'm
[27:08] happy with that so I deal with it and I
[27:11] will deal with the consequences or the
[27:13] problems later this is also called um
[27:16] Tech de so whenever you start a project
[27:19] you will be accumulating Tech de Tech de
[27:21] is something that will hit you back in a
[27:23] few years because you took a shortcut
[27:25] today because you had to do it so you
[27:27] take a short today you were happy today
[27:28] but in three years it would be like you
[27:30] remember this shortcut by the way well
[27:32] this is going to be a big problem now um
[27:36] and and this happens in every software
[27:38] development company uh but for me one of
[27:41] the biggest challenge was to go from uh
[27:44] one person team it's not a team but one
[27:47] person to becoming a team and and make
[27:50] sure that we can work um together in in
[27:53] Harmony and split the tasks
[27:56] appropriately and and make make sure
[27:58] that you know nothing is forgotten
[27:59] everybody is happy and and we're still
[28:02] killing it in terms of of uh scalability
[28:06] performance um feature implementation
[28:08] and all of this because I also have a
[28:10] tweet that I really love uh it's
[28:14] about uh the first version of the relay
[28:17] app didn't have any test written you
[28:21] know in software development you write
[28:22] test for your code there a lot of types
[28:24] of test that you should write so write
[28:27] your test but don't focus on writing
[28:30] your test if it's not a um a project
[28:34] that is out there for a few weeks or
[28:36] months or years even already don't don't
[28:38] try to over complicate things at the
[28:40] beginning the first version of relay
[28:41] didn't have any test didn't have proper
[28:44] logging so when there was an error I
[28:46] didn't even know what was happening I
[28:48] had to go myself and dig deep and it it
[28:50] was a nightmare to do this but if I was
[28:52] focusing too much on all of these things
[28:55] really would still be here in in in the
[28:57] software and we would never have this
[28:59] podcast because really wouldn't be what
[29:01] it is today uh so I think it's important
[29:04] to to do things step by step so you will
[29:08] start alone you will be both the front
[29:11] end developers backend developer devops
[29:14] and CTO you're the CTO to yourself but
[29:17] anyway you are the CTO because you need
[29:19] you need a title so it's this you know
[29:21] you have multiple hats this is the whole
[29:23] thing that this is a very known um this
[29:26] is how do you picture yourself in a
[29:27] startup you have different Hearts now
[29:29] it's a c your heart when you're talking
[29:31] to investors or or you know anything
[29:34] like that and then you have your
[29:35] developer hat when you're coding and
[29:37] then you might have your support because
[29:39] we're also doing support with with
[29:41] Julian and he was sending me screenshot
[29:43] or this user has this problem or they
[29:45] were reaching out to me dming me because
[29:47] they had problems so initially it's a
[29:49] lot of things at the same time and you
[29:50] shouldn't be afraid of that this is
[29:52] totally part of of the business it's
[29:55] also fun seriously I really enjoyed like
[29:57] this but then over time if you want to
[29:59] scale if you want to get bigger that's
[30:00] when you start hiring then you hire a
[30:03] front end developer you hire a backend
[30:04] developer you become a team with a team
[30:07] starts communication problems or issues
[30:10] you need to deal with you need to make
[30:11] sure that communication is well done
[30:13] nobody is forgetting anything um and
[30:16] that it's still uh going very well and
[30:20] and then the team grows the front end
[30:21] team becomes two three developers the
[30:23] back end team becomes two three
[30:25] developers um the same for super you're
[30:27] like look I'm not supposed my energy is
[30:30] worth putting more into the tech aspect
[30:33] let's hire someone for the support so we
[30:36] make sure that everybody in the team
[30:38] everybody in the team has an expertise
[30:40] on something and that's what they should
[30:42] focus 100% of th time maybe not 100 but
[30:45] 90% of their time should be focused on
[30:48] what they are the best at that's why
[30:51] they are joining our team to bring in
[30:53] their expertise so we say that when we
[30:56] hire someone they are the one telling us
[30:58] what to do and not us telling them what
[31:00] to do because they are the expert and we
[31:02] need them on board because of their
[31:03] expertise so and then you start focusing
[31:07] you need to make sure that every team
[31:09] member is focusing on what they are
[31:11] doing the best so all of this were just
[31:15] learnings uh for four years of of
[31:18] building building such a
[31:20] startup because it's nowhere comparable
[31:23] to any startup that I had before uh the
[31:26] the the level where we where we bought
[31:27] relays is is also a first for me and and
[31:30] still today still today I'm I'm learning
[31:33] so much and and it's always challenging
[31:36] and it's always a bit of excitement some
[31:39] fires burning here and there that you
[31:41] need to handle and that's why I love the
[31:44] startup world and uh so far these are
[31:47] the the small learnings I had and
[31:50] compared to what is coming I think it's
[31:51] it's nothing yeah it's a it's always a a
[31:54] wild ride the life and this a lot of
[31:57] challenges coming and when you have the
[31:59] challenge you're like oh how should
[32:00] I overcome this and two years afterwards
[32:03] you're bigger you're better and you're
[32:05] thinking like how could I even worried
[32:07] about this one so I think this is
[32:10] exactly oh you put it so well literally
[32:13] something that they would be killing you
[32:15] you will not sleep you will feel
[32:17] terrible you would just do whatever it
[32:20] takes to to get it out and is that you
[32:23] be did I really put all of this uh
[32:26] worries and all for that but but it was
[32:27] worth it I mean you needed this at the
[32:29] time today you need something else but
[32:31] just that you need to go with it and
[32:33] it's it's such a cliche to say enjoy the
[32:35] journey but it it's really it's it's all
[32:38] about the journey and it's a cliche for
[32:40] a reason because you just need to to
[32:43] enjoy it at the time whatever comes now
[32:46] uh will be completely different in a
[32:47] year or so but you today you need to
[32:49] deal with that if you want to be
[32:50] somewhere else in in in a year or even a
[32:53] month later but today this is the
[32:55] priority this is just what needs to be
[32:56] handled
[32:57] journey is also maybe a good point for
[33:00] the next question um moving on to
[33:02] bitcoin
[33:04] and something that a lot of bitcoiners
[33:07] also think about how will Bitcoin scale
[33:12] next 100 years to onboard like 8 billion
[33:15] people if like this fruition of like
[33:18] everyone having Bitcoin maybe even even
[33:21] being a payment system where the like
[33:23] the i in my buyer right I'm not sto
[33:26] tweeting about Bitcoin deal it's the
[33:28] base layer of our financial system and
[33:31] like how can we uh succeed in that what
[33:35] has to happen on the on the Bitcoin
[33:37] layers how many layers will be there
[33:39] will be like two or will there 10 layers
[33:43] uh will we be even there with Bitcoin as
[33:46] a payment system will it always be an
[33:48] asset like the whole whole package of
[33:51] Bitcoin scaling transaction fees what
[33:54] what are you thinking about
[33:55] that yeah it's a Pity uh you took me a
[33:58] bit uh on the spot here just a few hours
[34:02] ago they announced a podcast Peter mmak
[34:05] announ a podcast with John carvalo and
[34:08] jao talking about scaling Solutions I I
[34:11] wish I would have listened to that I
[34:13] would bring you an easier an easier
[34:15] answer but uh yeah actually uh so we we
[34:18] are obviously um this is something that
[34:20] that We Care a Lot why because looking
[34:24] at what happened
[34:25] recently and and since the beginning
[34:27] we've been only on chain only so layer
[34:30] one and looking at what happened
[34:32] recently it becoming quite it's becoming
[34:35] quite challenging to to be dependent on
[34:38] on on chain fees so much um because
[34:43] although although we appreciate and we
[34:45] really believe in um in our users owning
[34:49] their Bitcoin uh that's why we've been
[34:52] non-custodial from from the beginning
[34:54] and and we want to stay non-custodial
[34:57] it's getting more challenging the more
[34:58] layers you have the more being
[35:00] non-custodial becomes challenging on
[35:02] layer one even on layer one it's it's
[35:04] already challenging so imagine on L2
[35:07] L3 um and now already in May last year
[35:11] in 2023 in may we with with the
[35:14] craziness of you know BRC 20s ordinals
[35:19] inscriptions all of this we had a bit of
[35:21] a pick in the fees and this went really
[35:23] even worse in uh in
[35:25] December and we need to make sure that
[35:28] when we handle all these utx O's and all
[35:31] of this uh because we are an on ramp and
[35:34] users are are stacking with us on a
[35:36] weekly monthly basis and when the fees
[35:38] are at one sets per bite even if you
[35:40] have hundreds of utxos you can still
[35:42] handle it but then it becomes a problem
[35:46] when the when the fees go high and
[35:49] that's why we need to already uh and
[35:51] we've been already looking at the
[35:53] solutions for for some time now we just
[35:55] had two main problem with already before
[35:58] going to L2 to
[36:00] lightning uh we had the non-custodial
[36:02] problem and the liquidity problem
[36:05] so we wanted to stay on custodial and we
[36:08] couldn't afford putting like a lot of
[36:11] liquidity on Lightning just opening a
[36:12] lot of channels yeah hell yeah here is
[36:15] 100 more Bitcoin for for lightning and
[36:18] let's open a lot of channels to all of
[36:19] our users because we didn't have 100
[36:21] Bitcoin and we didn't have the the money
[36:23] to put in uh we are still U uh
[36:27] relatively early phase startup um and we
[36:32] were in touch with with whoever any name
[36:36] that can come to your mind related to
[36:38] lightning we were in touch with them and
[36:41] uh obviously giving them also
[36:42] information and data and they were
[36:44] helping us find the solution and we
[36:45] ended up with um collaborating with
[36:48] breeze on that so we are integrating a
[36:50] lightning wallet now in the relay wallet
[36:53] a non-custodial lightning wallet very
[36:55] important and we will release it by the
[36:57] end of January 2024 to all our users we
[37:02] are now testing it it's open for for
[37:05] beta testing but right now it's only the
[37:07] front end so it's only a lightning
[37:09] wallet users can still not buy or sell
[37:12] via lightning and this will come later
[37:13] this year this is already the challenges
[37:17] that we had to go to lightning three and
[37:20] a half years and lightning was already
[37:23] live and working when we launched so we
[37:25] could have put efforts already then and
[37:27] try to to come up with something but but
[37:29] we are not also working at the protocol
[37:31] we are not that's not our core uh
[37:35] business or uh where we where we excel
[37:39] at there are people that are really
[37:41] killing it at that and we leave it to
[37:43] them it it will be totally unfair to say
[37:46] that oh you know what we brought this to
[37:48] lightning so it's all our effort no no
[37:50] no we just rely on on people working on
[37:53] the on the protocol itself bringing this
[37:56] these tools
[37:57] that will make it easier uh for us and
[38:00] for our
[38:01] users so now this is already one step
[38:03] ahead and although there will be some
[38:07] onboarding fees on Lightning once we are
[38:11] there it will be faster and cheaper for
[38:13] our users so we'll not need to worry
[38:15] about utxos and all and then you
[38:18] mentioned also other layers and I think
[38:20] that's where we are heading to it's too
[38:22] early to say anything about L3 L4
[38:25] whatever but
[38:27] um but the way and I like at the time
[38:30] when they're announced web five you know
[38:32] as also a bit of a joke to web 3 and and
[38:35] that's where we are heading to uh I
[38:38] really like what the synonym team is
[38:41] doing with John carvalo and um slash
[38:45] tags I think they're called they will
[38:47] they will rename it but you know it's
[38:49] the whole aspect that yes Bitcoin L1 is
[38:53] all the the financial aspect the
[38:55] monetary structure and everything
[38:56] everything but then there is a lot on
[38:58] top of it like you know things like
[39:00] social sending things like a user they
[39:04] work a lot with the user experience as a
[39:05] user you don't need to worry about
[39:07] receiving onchain receiving on Lightning
[39:10] opening channels what is my address no
[39:13] these are all complications we want to
[39:14] get rid for the user the user shouldn't
[39:16] really worry about all of this and these
[39:19] are things that we shouldn't work on at
[39:21] at at the at the network layer at L1
[39:24] these are things we should fix at L2 L3
[39:26] level because that what it makes sense
[39:30] it we shouldn't just clock the the the
[39:32] network for such relatively easy or
[39:35] unnecessary things I would say so that's
[39:37] why I think that there will be much more
[39:41] layers I really believe there will be
[39:42] much more layers there are also things
[39:44] that are not problematic today but they
[39:46] will end up being a problem later that
[39:48] we are not aware of and we shouldn't try
[39:52] to fix these on on on the main layer
[39:54] it's just working perfectly fine as is
[39:57] and uh and the way it's going we are
[39:59] going towards uh main layer where uh we
[40:03] will have higher and higher fees and we
[40:06] will be using it for big
[40:08] transactions and we will be using
[40:10] already lining Network or any other L2
[40:14] solutions for much smaller transactions
[40:18] at lower fees yeah this is the this is
[40:20] also the way I see it I think the layer
[40:22] one is uh the an amazing elegent uh
[40:27] solution as a settlement layer if we
[40:30] call it that there Al a lot of other
[40:32] names we can call it and then the
[40:35] payment and all the other aspects uh we
[40:38] can we can put on layers above it um
[40:42] before we get to the uh Community
[40:45] questions I have a personal personal one
[40:48] for you because it seems that you and
[40:50] also Julian uh post a lot about their
[40:54] the sportiness and uh is it is it
[40:57] something across the relay team I saw a
[41:00] picture of of the relay team and they
[41:02] all looked kind of
[41:04] sporty and so like what's your like
[41:07] Fitness and eating routine and your
[41:09] health routine uh what is this looking
[41:13] like yeah yeah actually it is I mean um
[41:18] there is literally so we do twice a year
[41:21] we do a relay Summit we probably saw
[41:23] some pictures we sh also a lot of about
[41:25] pictures yeah we me meet in different
[41:28] locations every year two times um we did
[41:31] Zurich to start with because it's where
[41:34] where Rel was born uh we did Lisbon
[41:37] Berlin
[41:38] Istanbul uh we did poo recently we are
[41:41] doing um V Vienna recently as we will do
[41:46] this year so uh um and every time we
[41:49] meet in these Summits it's true that uh
[41:52] Fitness is always coming to the to to
[41:55] the topic to the discussion and I
[41:58] wouldn't say the whole team but there is
[42:00] always a part of the team that is also
[42:01] doing going to the gym or going for a
[42:03] run even during the Summits and I think
[42:06] this is this is this is a lifestyle I
[42:09] mean it's not part of our interviewing
[42:12] process you don't need you don't need to
[42:14] be going to the gym if you want to be
[42:16] part of the the team but it it's just
[42:19] it's just um it's just a lifestyle and
[42:22] and this really
[42:24] shows how structured you are in your
[42:27] life look I used to wake up at halfast 5
[42:32] or at 600 just to go to the gym before
[42:33] everybody wakes up just that I'm ready
[42:36] for my day and you don't realize it at
[42:38] the time you just feel happy because
[42:39] you're going to the gym but what it does
[42:42] it just structures your whole day you're
[42:44] starting your day by being punctual and
[42:49] by really putting a lot of energy to
[42:52] your health and your well-being there is
[42:55] no way that this day ends up bad I mean
[42:58] this is just what it is right
[43:01] so it's like this whole a player
[43:05] strategy and I think it's if you really
[43:07] killing it in one domain of your life
[43:10] you will end up if you look at that
[43:11] person you will see that well actually
[43:13] they care about their their their wealth
[43:15] their health because they need to be in
[43:18] a good shape if if you want to kill it
[43:20] this just goes together you need to be
[43:22] eating well and take care of your health
[43:25] if you want to be performing well also
[43:27] in um in in your job and especially in
[43:31] the startup world where where it's it's
[43:33] quite intense and requirements can be
[43:36] tough and you need to be ready and you
[43:38] need to be you you can never be ready
[43:41] although you need to be ready so all all
[43:43] in all it it goes together that you the
[43:46] better you are in your in your life
[43:49] especially healthwise being nutrition
[43:52] and and Sport the better you will
[43:54] perform and so it goes the other way
[43:57] around so whoever we end
[44:00] up hiring or whoever ends up being like
[44:03] wow this this guy is a killer or this
[44:05] girl is a killer they also end up taking
[44:08] care of their uh Health very very
[44:11] carefully and I think that's that's just
[44:14] it just goes together that's why it's
[44:15] probably looks like this but it's not
[44:17] that in the CV we are requesting your
[44:20] diet and your your um your Fitness level
[44:25] but yeah like emo did his Marathon last
[44:28] year Julian is going for one this year
[44:31] now although I am more in weightlifting
[44:33] like maybe I should go for a marathon as
[44:35] well you know and then it goes well
[44:37] together and it's like we talk about
[44:38] Marathon at every Summit and we also had
[44:41] Yanik doing one in our team who have
[44:43] tamas just doing cycling so what you
[44:45] said is really true but it it goes the
[44:48] other way around we whoever we brought
[44:50] in a team and that shows this um this
[44:53] willingness of killing it actually they
[44:55] are all very careful about their health
[44:58] yeah that's that's amazing I think
[45:00] there's also like a group thing like
[45:02] when a lot of people are so like-minded
[45:05] with Bitcoin and the early adoption of
[45:07] Bitcoin and they are so curious about
[45:09] life they're mindful about what they're
[45:11] doing of course they're also looking
[45:13] about looking about their health and
[45:15] wealth so that's that's that's just a
[45:20] almost a no-brainer that such an early
[45:22] Bitcoin only team uh is caring about the
[45:25] health
[45:26] um moving on to the community questions
[45:30] I got two interesting ones uh the first
[45:33] one is a technical one the second one is
[45:36] a personal one uh the first one it seems
[45:39] that reala is targeting mainly
[45:41] beginners uh are you going to develop
[45:44] tools and settings for more advanced
[45:46] users and he wrote some uh examples for
[45:49] M multiple addresses change addresses
[45:52] utico
[45:54] management this some going to happen on
[45:58] relay very good question I love that
[46:01] question because I hear that that a lot
[46:05] and fair enough because sometimes it
[46:07] looks counterintuitive because we are
[46:10] like
[46:11] bitcoiners and in the end our really
[46:13] wallet is like well you know there are
[46:15] better wallets out there and I'm like
[46:18] yes fair enough we are not the best when
[46:21] it comes to implementing best practices
[46:25] and I'm not saying say this as as if I
[46:27] don't care obviously I do care but there
[46:30] is a balance between what we can do and
[46:33] what our users expect so for example
[46:37] coin control we didn't have proper coin
[46:39] control for some time we had an issue we
[46:41] fixed it now it's coming but there is no
[46:44] Advanced coin control so you cannot go
[46:45] in the settings and select some coins
[46:48] you want to spend or ignore some coins
[46:50] you don't want to spend this is not in
[46:52] the relay wallet another one that is
[46:54] getting critical now and we're work
[46:55] working on is address change initially
[46:57] we just said you know what this is how
[46:59] it has to be and this for for various
[47:02] reasons it's not only because it was
[47:04] easy to implement it was also because
[47:07] our broker was not supporting it at the
[47:09] time we were working with a third party
[47:10] broker we don't have our own broker and
[47:13] the second one is it was already a big
[47:15] challenge for our users in the question
[47:17] you mention newcommerce or newbies and
[47:20] that's exactly from the beginning this
[47:22] is our target
[47:24] market um
[47:26] I mean we never claim to be for uh for
[47:29] advanced bitcoiners we appreciate their
[47:31] support and we are all uh bitcoiners in
[47:33] the team we know that there are still a
[47:35] lot of things we need to improve but we
[47:37] need to improve them in a very user
[47:41] experience efficient way we cannot just
[47:44] go out and Implement address change
[47:46] because every time a user will go to the
[47:49] receive button they will see a different
[47:51] address and they will freak
[47:53] out they will literally freak out the
[47:55] way they want to use Bitcoin is the way
[47:58] they use their banking system you only
[48:00] have one iban and you share this iban
[48:02] with everybody and they end up by just
[48:04] having one wallet address and they share
[48:06] it with everybody again it's terrible
[48:08] it's terrible for privacy and we are
[48:11] already taking measures we're talking
[48:12] about Solutions currently in the team
[48:15] obviously could it have come earlier yes
[48:18] but at a cost where we might have lost
[48:20] some users because it was really not
[48:22] easy for them and it it's the same for a
[48:26] lot of features so some people are
[48:29] asking about why not tooot now yes Tapo
[48:31] is also good we could also work on that
[48:34] and try to get it there but there are a
[48:36] lot of things we need to work for our
[48:38] target market that would bring in more
[48:40] awareness and more people into Bitcoin
[48:43] than too in the Reay wallet too is very
[48:46] good if you have a
[48:48] um uh multi- uh Sig wallet uh but then
[48:53] it's also not ideal if you don't have a
[48:55] multi wallet it's also not ideal for the
[48:57] fees where segwit is handling it better
[49:00] so all of this all of this together it
[49:02] was an easy decision to say you know
[49:04] what for now we live tap the side we
[49:05] will get there we started with Legacy
[49:07] very quickly we went to to nested segwit
[49:10] but then again our broker was not
[49:12] supported uh Native segwit so we had to
[49:15] wait to implement our own broker to go
[49:17] full
[49:18] segwit but it's it's it's exactly what
[49:21] is happening we are aware of this
[49:24] limitations and we are just implementing
[49:27] them as they come and as much as they
[49:29] are userfriendly what we do and what we
[49:32] did for some time was to hide some of
[49:34] them in an advanced feature so you could
[49:37] go to the settings and click uh enable
[49:40] Advanced features and then in the app
[49:42] you would see things like you could
[49:44] select custom fees when you send a a
[49:47] transaction you could select custom fees
[49:49] you could put one sets per bite and it
[49:50] will go with one sets per bite and then
[49:53] even this ended up being quite
[49:55] problematic we had a lot of super
[49:56] tickets piling up because the
[49:58] transaction was was stuck in the men
[50:00] pool so then we were like you know what
[50:02] let's maybe remove it and just put three
[50:04] options uh fast medium and slow and this
[50:07] turned out to help a lot and work better
[50:11] so we will get to a point where I think
[50:13] anyway we will Implement them we will
[50:15] maybe initially hide them behind a
[50:18] feature like uh an advanced feature and
[50:20] if it's disabled by default users will
[50:23] not see it only if they enable they will
[50:25] see this Advanced options and over time
[50:28] try to make it the default also for
[50:31] newbies as soon as they're become user
[50:33] friendly with ux and UI from day one
[50:37] this is the biggest challenge we had at
[50:38] relay it's always solving UI ux problems
[50:41] more than solving technical problems
[50:43] technical problems there are a lot of
[50:45] people out there doing it better than us
[50:47] coming up with bibs improvements
[50:49] whatever on lightning or or on or on
[50:51] bitcoin and what we do is take them and
[50:54] try to make them user friendly oh that's
[50:57] that's great and then I think it also if
[50:59] you and you touched on it if you have
[51:02] all the Imp implementations you you use
[51:06] you lose a lot of beginners in the app
[51:09] uh because I also think of oh if my
[51:13] uncle who has no clue about technical
[51:15] stuff who wants to be in Bitcoin because
[51:19] he's understands it on a financial level
[51:22] uh he should have an really easy
[51:24] onboarding like he should have that app
[51:26] where I can just send him the referral
[51:28] link and he can get his first Bitcoin in
[51:31] a a few minutes or an hour something
[51:33] like that and then then from that moment
[51:37] on he can learn uh about self custody
[51:40] later he can learn about you takes own
[51:42] management he can learn about all the
[51:44] things he has to learn a little later
[51:47] like we don't have to overwhelm uh
[51:50] newbies for Bitcoin at the first minute
[51:54] I also had Daniel for 21 Bitcoin on and
[51:56] he was also like first let's give them
[51:59] Bitcoin let's give them the exposure and
[52:02] uh they can learn along the way at when
[52:05] I first bought Bitcoin I did not even
[52:08] understand what it was like I had no
[52:10] clue I never heard utex o utex o
[52:13] actually only heard in 2023 and I'm and
[52:18] I'm Bitcoin only since
[52:20] 2021 so I I learned really late so I
[52:25] think everybody has his own learning
[52:27] process and his Learning Journey and
[52:30] there's a lot of advantages of having
[52:32] really and other Bitcoin only apps that
[52:35] are just in really easy onramp uh to the
[52:39] Bitcoin world and it's important that we
[52:41] have a lot of different options that
[52:43] there are wallets out there with all the
[52:44] controls for the advanced users and then
[52:46] there's wallets for the beginners and I
[52:49] like that really as around and bringing
[52:52] uh the masses onto the Bitcoin as as we
[52:55] all do and uh that you join uh that you
[52:59] are in for the for the mission um
[53:02] definitely we have the second question
[53:05] is a personal one how do you and maybe I
[53:08] need some tips actually from you in that
[53:10] regard how do you grow your
[53:15] beard okay fair enough uh good one okay
[53:19] good one well I would have never thought
[53:21] that I would live such a such a beard I
[53:23] must say I'm I'm I'm always I always
[53:26] been the clean shaved guy and you know I
[53:29] was like no it has to be clean shaved
[53:31] and all I think this is the the the the
[53:34] before Bitcoin and after
[53:36] Bitcoin it turned out to to to look
[53:39] pretty good and um you know obviously I
[53:41] had to I had to I had the the talk with
[53:44] my wife and like okay let's give it a
[53:46] try and now it's like yeah you keep it
[53:48] there is no way you get rid of this but
[53:51] uh um I am a bit uh lucky or biased in
[53:55] that one because here the the DNA plays
[53:57] a big role and um and I have Turkish
[54:00] Origins yeah so it's a it's not a
[54:03] problem to grow a beard it's more a
[54:05] problem not to grow a beard in for for
[54:09] for Turkish people and uh so it was
[54:12] relatively easy actually I think it's I
[54:14] should trim it a bit it's getting a bit
[54:16] too much now but I get so used to it now
[54:19] and and and I like it it goes so well
[54:21] with the whole lightning topic and Zeus
[54:23] you know with the beard and I was joking
[54:26] last time on on Twitter that yeah I'm
[54:30] Bitcoin Zeus uh I have the beard but now
[54:33] I need to build the body right because
[54:34] he's like zos is really uh massive a lot
[54:38] of muscles so now I'm working on the
[54:40] body because the beard was the easy part
[54:42] now I need the body but yeah I mean it's
[54:44] not about there's no secret oil or or
[54:48] lotion that I can recommend you
[54:50] unfortunately so uh yeah it's all in the
[54:53] it's all in the DNA yeah I'm I'm jealous
[54:55] I'm
[54:57] jealous fair enough we having the end
[54:59] routine and maybe if you're a fan of the
[55:01] Diary of a CEO you know where the Andrew
[55:03] Dean is coming from because I just stole
[55:05] it from him where the previous guest
[55:07] asked the question for for the next
[55:10] guest um and the question uh and that's
[55:13] we we touched on it a little bit uh what
[55:16] do you think ordinals pose a risk or
[55:18] opportunity for Bitcoin and uh why uh
[55:21] for me I don't like this things
[55:25] happening on the main chain on the main
[55:27] layer ordinals inscriptions
[55:30] brc2 especially brc2 and all these me
[55:33] meme coins they literally have no
[55:36] utility and I consider this an attack on
[55:39] bitcoin it's it's obvious and they're
[55:42] not even hiding I mean it would be quite
[55:46] uh stupid to say that yeah know they're
[55:49] it's a technical uh advancement oh wow
[55:52] it's it's fabulous no so um dang I don't
[55:55] know I mean in the end some people would
[55:57] also be in in favor of look it's a valid
[56:00] transaction yes it is a valid
[56:01] transaction and and you can't get rid of
[56:04] it you shouldn't get rid of it that's
[56:05] also fair but it's also not what Bitcoin
[56:10] was meant for and I would be willing to
[56:13] talk say it and talk with these people
[56:16] and find a solution that's the way to do
[56:18] it but the way it's been done that was
[56:21] clearly an attack I don't think it's
[56:23] it's the way it should be done
[56:25] um so I'm I'm happy I'm more than happy
[56:28] to get rid of this U
[56:32] unnecessary block space from from the
[56:35] main layer and and this I've been I've
[56:37] been pretty clear about it I'm not
[56:39] against people collecting gegs or
[56:41] whatever everybody can do whatever they
[56:43] want with with the life and it doesn't
[56:46] make sense because there are much better
[56:47] technology out there to do this as I
[56:50] said you know we started our our our
[56:51] talk with u crypto projects in general
[56:55] and technically technologically speaking
[56:59] they're doing other stuff and they're
[57:01] doing it much better than on bitcoin so
[57:04] why not just go there and and use and
[57:06] use that instead or or why not bring
[57:09] that as a layer three layer four
[57:11] whatever on bitcoin and use it for that
[57:14] I mean I wouldn't be against that but as
[57:18] they are right now and the the main
[57:22] layer I don't think they make sense I
[57:25] fully agree with with you here I mean uh
[57:28] the the I think it's an attack I think
[57:32] they try to attack it but in the end I
[57:34] think they just make Bitcoin uh Stronger
[57:38] with every attack that goes onto Bitcoin
[57:41] uh but it's uh I fully agree with you
[57:44] that's that's an attack that and it's an
[57:46] unnecessary they could do it somewhere
[57:48] else but they wanted to do it on on
[57:50] bitcoin I don't know if they think it's
[57:52] an attack but it's definitely one
[57:56] well they they are clearly happy that
[57:58] they broke Bitcoin so I guess it's h
[58:01] they know exactly what they're doing and
[58:03] fortunately now it looks like it calmed
[58:05] down a bit because anyway they need
[58:07] money for that so at some point
[58:09] eventually you get out of money but yeah
[58:12] I mean I'm fine I mean look guys come
[58:14] with a solution on L2 L3 L4 whatever you
[58:17] want you want to work together on that
[58:19] yeah let's discuss and let's do whatever
[58:21] you want but it's not the main layer is
[58:23] not the the place it should be
[58:25] perfect then uh thank you for being on
[58:28] uh for the uh last part where do you
[58:31] want to people uh to to direct people
[58:34] there uh like uh where can people get in
[58:37] touch with
[58:38] you yeah so I'm pretty much uh recently
[58:41] only focusing on Twitter or X apparently
[58:44] we should call it X now so they can find
[58:46] me if they look for my name it's uncore
[58:49] Adam
[58:51] bancore um and also uh for anything Rel
[58:55] to the project relay. app for our
[58:57] website perfect uh thank you for being
[59:01] on thank you for having me Robin that's
[59:03] a pleasure
