[00:00] And that takes away our ability to own a
[00:01] house. It takes away our ability to
[00:03] start a family. It takes away our
[00:05] ability to provide for our kids. It
[00:06] takes away our ability to provide for
[00:08] our elderly parents. Bitcoin lets us
[00:10] plan for those future years. Individuals
[00:13] want to try to get cheeky. They want to
[00:15] try to outsmart the market. They want to
[00:17] try timing the market. But at the end of
[00:19] the day, this is true. You just win by
[00:22] having time in the market. You cannot
[00:24] win in this game by thinking
[00:26] monthtomonth. That's not just for
[00:27] Bitcoin. That's for any kind of
[00:29] investing that you're trying to do. And
[00:31] there's no issuer who's going to decide
[00:33] how much the Bitcoin is worth. It's the
[00:35] market. It's all of us who decide what
[00:37] Bitcoin is worth. Uh you're extremely
[00:39] early. You'll see what it's like to be
[00:41] late when you can no longer purchase it
[00:42] with fiat dollars with with government
[00:44] money. That's when you will be too late.
[00:46] You know, when you can only work for for
[00:48] Bitcoin, long-term visions of the
[00:50] future, long-term capital preservation,
[00:53] long-term providing for your family,
[00:55] providing for people who aren't even
[00:56] born yet. The solution is right in front
[00:58] of them and they don't even realize it.
[00:59] And that solution is a harder currency.
[01:01] It's Bitcoin.
[01:03] [Music]
[01:07] Hi Jordan, how you doing? Everything
[01:09] fine on your end? Yes sir, I'm doing
[01:11] good. Welcome back to a brand new
[01:12] episode of Jinzy BTC. It's me, Satoshi
[01:15] Guapamoto. And of course, thank you so
[01:17] much Rob and Sire for having me on your
[01:18] podcast. Really cool. Thank you so much
[01:21] for being on. Um, we have there's a lot
[01:23] happening in in Bitcoin, especially also
[01:25] since since you last been on. How's your
[01:28] overall feeling currently of of of
[01:30] Bitcoin and what's going on? I think
[01:31] you're also really involved in the
[01:33] community and you know a lot what's
[01:35] what's going on? Yes. Um, it's been not
[01:39] exactly a year but a couple months since
[01:41] I've been on and uh the landscape is
[01:43] completely different. All right. The
[01:45] price is completely different and
[01:47] everything is moving so quickly. you
[01:48] know, if I come back on again in a year,
[01:50] we'll be looking back saying again how
[01:52] much things have changed. So, I feel
[01:54] like we're slowly getting closer to that
[01:56] gradually uh and then suddenly moment.
[01:58] We're still in the gradually, but we're
[02:00] right there at the peak of the S-curve
[02:02] or the tip of the S-curve where things
[02:03] really take off. Um, we've had a Bitcoin
[02:06] reserve get confirmed in the United
[02:08] States. You know, we have all these
[02:10] banks who are now allowed to custody
[02:11] Bitcoin. Uh, we have more and more
[02:13] individuals, companies, pension funds
[02:15] getting into Bitcoin. And some people
[02:17] see this as a negative, some people see
[02:19] it as a positive. Uh but at the end of
[02:21] the day, the truth is Bitcoin literally
[02:24] is for anyone. And whether you have no
[02:27] money or whether you have all the money
[02:28] in the world, you're going to want to
[02:29] try to keep what you do have. And that
[02:31] means that Bitcoin adoption is going to
[02:33] be taken on by all sorts of entities,
[02:35] all kinds of individuals, all sorts of
[02:38] governments, all sorts of institutions.
[02:40] And that's kind of just the way it is.
[02:41] you know, we just have to make sure that
[02:43] we're focused on the core principles of
[02:45] Bitcoin and uh what it stands for, what
[02:47] it means, what it does, not the price,
[02:49] you know, and that's why a lot of people
[02:50] are kind of scared right now on Twitter,
[02:52] on X. They're all complaining. They're
[02:54] crying bull markets over, blah blah
[02:56] blah. I don't think so. I think we're
[02:58] just getting
[02:59] started. Interesting. I love that. And
[03:02] and I mean, there's there's a lot um
[03:05] just because you said it now. um uh the
[03:07] the the bull market you're saying is is
[03:09] not over and we're just getting started.
[03:12] Um why or how do do we think about that?
[03:16] Um well typically if we just go based on
[03:18] the pattern all right Bitcoin has a
[03:20] green green green red year right
[03:22] obviously past performance is not an
[03:24] indicator of future performance but it
[03:27] makes sense based on the having all
[03:28] right based on the amount of
[03:30] accumulation that we're seeing right
[03:31] now. A lot of long-term holders are
[03:33] accumulating large amounts of Bitcoin,
[03:35] right? There's a lot of Bitcoin that's
[03:37] getting taken off the market
[03:38] permanently. Like when we look at
[03:40] governments, literally in the reserve
[03:41] bill, it says that the United States
[03:43] should not or will not sell that Bitcoin
[03:45] for 20 years. Uh that's a lot of Bitcoin
[03:47] being taken off the market permanently.
[03:49] Uh the United States is also a not not a
[03:52] price dependent buyer. All right? They
[03:54] don't really care what the price is.
[03:55] They're going to be buying the Bitcoin.
[03:56] You know, uh Michael Sailor buying huge
[03:59] amounts of Bitcoin. He's not selling it.
[04:00] So this is permanently being taken off
[04:02] the market. So I think that we're just
[04:05] now seeing the really really big players
[04:07] come into the space and I want to make
[04:09] sure that as many normies like you or me
[04:12] are stacking sats while we still have
[04:14] the chance, you know, because Bitcoin is
[04:15] still extremely cheap because we're able
[04:17] to buy it with fake money. We're able to
[04:19] buy it with dollars, right? Um I would
[04:22] also say that the bull market is not
[04:23] over just because we've seen a 20 or 25%
[04:26] pullback. If you look historically,
[04:28] we've seen this multiple times. All
[04:30] right, 2017 bull market, a 2021 bull
[04:33] market, there's constantly pullbacks of
[04:36] 25, 35, even 45% uh which then lead to
[04:41] massive run-ups, right? You know, dips
[04:43] are just the distribution of Bitcoin
[04:45] from weak hands to strong hands and the
[04:48] strong hands don't want to give up their
[04:49] Bitcoin so easily and that's when we see
[04:51] these massive rips in price. How do you
[04:53] look actually at the uh buying behavior
[04:56] of of institution and individuals? I
[04:59] almost have the fear that institutions
[05:01] get it better and institutions are like
[05:04] buying and holding and they don't they
[05:05] don't care that much about uh price.
[05:08] Obviously USA is is is an extreme
[05:10] example but even like familyowned
[05:12] businesses if they um and I talked with
[05:15] with some people even in Austria that uh
[05:17] having those contacts and like if
[05:19] familyowned businesses, small
[05:21] businesses, mediumsized businesses if
[05:22] they're buying Bitcoin, they're having a
[05:24] very strategic plan. They're like buying
[05:27] and they're holding. they have done like
[05:28] 5 10 20 year holding plans. Uh even the
[05:33] USA I think the bill for which currently
[05:35] is in the house and senate from silus
[05:38] that there is also a 20 year holding
[05:40] period suggested in there uh and
[05:43] individuals trying to be fancy with like
[05:46] trading in alt coins trying to get more
[05:48] leveraging and all those things. It's
[05:50] sometimes sad to see that individuals
[05:52] are uh not just buying and holding. I
[05:55] mean obviously we too preach that. I
[05:58] only do buying and holding. I like my
[06:00] Satoshi balance went only up over the
[06:03] years. Uh which is a very satisfying
[06:05] feeling. Uh but I think a lot of
[06:08] individuals don't do that. Even in in in
[06:10] our audiences probably a lot that that
[06:13] don't do that.
[06:15] Yeah. No. And uh part of that is because
[06:17] individuals want to try to get cheeky.
[06:20] They want to try to outsmart the market.
[06:22] They want to try timing the market. But
[06:24] at the end of the day, this is true. You
[06:26] just win by having time in the market.
[06:29] All right? And that's why institutions
[06:31] and bigger players end up beating the
[06:33] little guys because they have visions of
[06:36] decades, right? They have a vision of
[06:38] fiveyear time spans. All right? Whereas
[06:40] individuals are thinking one month, two
[06:43] months, right? You cannot win in this
[06:45] game by thinking monthtomonth. That's
[06:47] not just for Bitcoin. That's for any
[06:49] kind of investing uh that you're trying
[06:51] to do, right? But if you're buying
[06:52] stocks, like you can't just buy Tesla
[06:53] and Amazon and hope to hold it for a
[06:55] month and then get out and think that
[06:56] you're going to make all these amazing
[06:58] gains. That's not how it works. Okay? It
[07:00] takes very long time periods for things
[07:02] to happen for companies to grow, for
[07:04] networks to grow. All right? So that's
[07:06] why the institutionals uh investors win
[07:09] on that front. Uh another thing is
[07:11] individuals are so focused on instant
[07:14] gratification. They're so focused on
[07:15] like that tick- tock brain rot
[07:17] everything needs to happen now now that
[07:19] you get too shortsighted right again
[07:22] long-term visions of the future
[07:24] long-term capital preservation long-term
[07:28] providing for your family providing for
[07:30] people who aren't even born yet all
[07:31] right the people who hold Bitcoin today
[07:33] are going to be you know seen as legends
[07:37] because they'll look back and they'll
[07:38] say well how were you able to hold it
[07:39] all the way from 80,000 all the way up
[07:42] to you know 800,000 you And if you have
[07:45] the vision, you realize, well, they're
[07:47] not making any more Bitcoin. So, the
[07:49] supply is inelastic. They keep making
[07:51] more dollars, which means just by
[07:54] principle, the amount of dollar per
[07:56] Bitcoin value has to go up. The amount
[07:58] of units of dollars needed to equate to
[08:01] the 21 million Bitcoin, that number has
[08:03] to go up. So, you have to forego your
[08:05] present- day consumption and save it for
[08:08] the future. Companies are focused on
[08:10] being around in the next hundred years,
[08:12] right? they're focused on dominating in
[08:14] the next hundred years. Individuals,
[08:16] we're kind of stuck on trying to make it
[08:18] week to week, monthto month. If you can
[08:20] fight that mindset and make sure you
[08:21] plan for the future uh 5 years out,
[08:24] decades out, and then you'll look back
[08:25] and you'll thank your your past self
[08:27] because of the decisions that you make
[08:28] today.
[08:30] That's that's so true. It's it's it's
[08:32] like you you make a decision now and and
[08:34] and your future uh self will absolutely
[08:37] thank you. That I I love that framing.
[08:40] Um, maybe let's go a little bit uh a
[08:42] step back and and and look at the field
[08:44] system. For me, it's always super
[08:46] interesting and you you talked about it
[08:48] before we we started recording with the
[08:50] big print. Uh, and it's also I think
[08:52] Larry Leah is is kind of famous for
[08:55] saying also that that that big print
[08:57] story. For me, it's kind of fascinating
[08:59] that the big print is still going on
[09:02] like that that the fear system for some
[09:04] reason is still still here. How do you
[09:06] look at the the fear system and the
[09:08] decline of the fiat system and how fast
[09:10] this this will go? Yeah. The reason why
[09:12] the big print is still happening the
[09:14] reason why the fiat experiment is still
[09:16] happening is because people don't know
[09:17] what the problem is. You know, they
[09:19] don't really know what's going on. They
[09:20] just see the price of their stuff going
[09:22] up. The dollar doesn't stretch as far.
[09:24] Uh in the EU, you know, the euro is
[09:26] already failing. It hasn't even been
[09:27] around that long. It's already failing.
[09:28] It's lost so much of its purchasing
[09:30] power. Uh and you know, we're seeing
[09:32] governments start to get more and more
[09:34] desperate, right? Because they also
[09:36] understand, hm, this is not good. You
[09:37] know, we've used all the tricks in the
[09:39] book. We're using yield curve control.
[09:41] We're trying to keep the interest rates
[09:43] uh artificially inflated. We're trying
[09:45] to use quantitative easing and all this
[09:47] other crazy stuff that they don't talk
[09:49] about in school. They don't talk about
[09:50] on the news. All these different terms,
[09:52] all these buzzwords, all this jargon, so
[09:54] that way normal people don't know what's
[09:55] going on. But to put it in layman's
[09:57] terms, at the end of the day, your money
[09:59] is getting diluted. All right? Your
[10:01] money is becoming worth less. And
[10:03] governments are starting to get a little
[10:04] bit nervous, you know, because they know
[10:06] that the only way out of this type of
[10:08] crisis when you have deficits this big,
[10:10] when you have this much debt on the
[10:11] books that you can't pay back, when
[10:13] you're overspending this much, there's
[10:15] only one thing you can do, and that's to
[10:17] try to print your way out. And that's
[10:19] why Larry Leard talks about the big
[10:20] print. You know, again, I'm still
[10:22] reading the book, but uh it's it's just
[10:25] the layman's version of explaining
[10:27] what's going on in our monetary system.
[10:29] And once people understand the problem
[10:31] that someone controls your money, you
[10:34] don't have any choice in it. You know,
[10:35] they can print up $2 trillion of it,
[10:37] making your share in the monetary
[10:39] network smaller because they inflated
[10:41] the supply of dollars, right? Uh you
[10:44] didn't have a vote on that. You didn't
[10:45] have any say in that. They did that
[10:46] unilaterally without your consent and
[10:49] they made you poorer without you having
[10:51] any say in that. These guys aren't even
[10:53] elected officials. All right? And this
[10:55] this happens not just in the United
[10:56] States, happens everywhere. You know,
[10:58] once people start to understand that
[10:59] that problem, they realize that the
[11:01] solution is right in front of them and
[11:03] they don't even realize it. And that
[11:04] solution is a harder currency. It's
[11:06] Bitcoin, right? Um Bitcoin is not just
[11:08] some thing that goes up in numbers. You
[11:11] know, the number value doesn't just go
[11:12] up. It's a network that people can use
[11:14] to transact to each other without any
[11:17] intermediary. And there's no issuer
[11:20] who's going to decide how much the
[11:22] Bitcoin is worth. It's the market. It's
[11:23] all of us who decide what Bitcoin is
[11:25] worth. Right? So, um there's no one
[11:28] who's making decisions for you. Bitcoin
[11:29] is a way to take control of your own
[11:31] life and your own financial future.
[11:33] Absolutely. 100. I couldn't agree more.
[11:36] it. But what one thing I'm I'm really
[11:40] want to
[11:41] uh get into is is the the network effect
[11:45] of of fear money. I think that's one at
[11:47] least that's one of my um explanations
[11:50] why fear is still around. Uh when you
[11:53] think about the network effects even of
[11:55] like Facebook uh and and and social
[11:57] media networks that are huge and and
[12:00] people say like oh it's bad to be on
[12:01] Facebook. Oh like WhatsApp is bad.
[12:03] should be on, I don't know, Telegram
[12:05] signal or like sessions or any other
[12:07] things. But those things are still so
[12:09] huge. Even though some people don't want
[12:11] to be on, they are still on on there. Um
[12:15] because they have a network effect.
[12:18] uh how do you think about network
[12:20] effects on monies like feared as they
[12:22] are like longlasting career even though
[12:25] they are so broken in nature and how do
[12:28] you think that will slowly come to to
[12:31] Bitcoin with with the network effect uh
[12:33] as as the Bitcoin network effect is
[12:36] still very small in in terms of like how
[12:39] many people actually have it and use it
[12:40] and and and store their money in
[12:44] yeah I think that uh in terms of the
[12:46] amount of people who hold Bitcoin maybe
[12:48] like 3 4% of the world, you know, uh in
[12:50] terms of the amount of people who
[12:51] actually use Bitcoin to transact, maybe
[12:54] 1% of the world. And then the people who
[12:56] truly truly understand Bitcoin at a
[12:59] deeper level, I would say the level that
[13:00] me and you and some of our audience
[13:02] understand it at is even less than that
[13:03] 1%. So the people who say that you're
[13:05] too late to Bitcoin because it's
[13:06] $100,000 or whatever it might be, uh
[13:09] you're extremely early. You'll see what
[13:10] it's like to be late when you can no
[13:12] longer purchase it with fiat dollars
[13:14] with with government money. that's when
[13:16] you will be too late, you know, when you
[13:17] can only work for for Bitcoin. Um, but
[13:20] in terms of the network effect, right,
[13:22] the difference between a social media
[13:24] type uh network effect and a Bitcoin
[13:26] network effect is that money converges
[13:30] to one and there's an opportunity cost
[13:32] of holding the wrong money, right? So,
[13:35] what we're slowly seeing if we look at
[13:37] the altcoins, you know, uh, and anyone
[13:39] can look this up. You can look up an
[13:40] altcoin chart. You can look up Bitcoin
[13:42] dominance. You can look up any altcoin
[13:44] priced in Bitcoin. What you're seeing
[13:46] over the last five years, 10 years, 15
[13:47] years is that the dominance of Bitcoin
[13:50] is continuing to grow. And that these
[13:52] altcoins priced in Bitcoin, their prices
[13:54] are slowly declining uh over time. And
[13:57] the reason why is because more and more
[13:59] people are converging to the one coin
[14:02] that is a commodity that is not run by a
[14:04] company, that doesn't have a CEO that
[14:07] they can use without anyone else's
[14:08] permission. All right. When it comes to
[14:11] something like being on X and Snapchat
[14:13] and Facebook and on threads or whatever
[14:16] it is, all these different social
[14:17] medias, there's not really an incurred
[14:20] cost there. You're not really losing a
[14:22] bunch of money by being on all four of
[14:24] them at one time. However, when it comes
[14:26] to money, if your money is 25% in
[14:29] Bitcoin, 25% Ethereum, 25% in Salana,
[14:32] 25% in some random memecoin, you're
[14:34] actually losing a lot of money. There's
[14:36] a big cost there. And if you're a
[14:38] rational actor, you're not going to want
[14:40] to lose money. You're going to want to
[14:42] move the other 75% into the one store of
[14:45] value asset out of those four. And that
[14:47] is Bitcoin, right? So there is a network
[14:51] effect that actually has consequences.
[14:53] There's a huge consequence of not being
[14:55] in the proper network. And at the end of
[14:57] the day, if you're a rational person,
[14:59] you will make the decision to switch all
[15:01] of your valuable assets into the one
[15:03] thing that will store value, not lose
[15:05] value.
[15:06] Super interesting. It's It's really nice
[15:09] how you how you frame it. I like that a
[15:11] lot. Is Is there something um where you
[15:15] say like that's the major trigger that
[15:17] you look at for that switch for people
[15:21] that like okay like we actually get
[15:23] Bitcoin now. I I was funny story. I was
[15:26] I'm invited tomorrow on a normal podcast
[15:30] uh in in Germany uh in Austria. Uh, and
[15:34] uh, it's it's a podcast not about
[15:36] Bitcoin at all, but a friend of mine is
[15:38] is involved there and she just sent me
[15:40] the list of questions and I was like,
[15:43] "Oh, question is like, is Bitcoin a
[15:45] pyramid scheme?" Like, why not? And like
[15:48] all those things I'm like, are we are we
[15:51] that early? Do I really have to still
[15:54] explain that? So, I feel like the
[15:57] populace is really like really early
[15:58] still.
[16:00] Um is do you think like first of all
[16:03] maybe do you think there is that event
[16:05] where within like five 10 years like a
[16:08] very short amount of time all of the
[16:09] sudden we we hit the mass market. Uh if
[16:12] so what what do you think will will that
[16:15] be or how do you look at the future
[16:16] adoption?
[16:18] Uh I would say that Bitcoin is already
[16:20] mainstream. You know there's pretty much
[16:22] every anyone on earth uh even a lot of
[16:24] old people you can ask them have you
[16:26] heard of Bitcoin? they'll know that
[16:28] name. But the next step just requires
[16:32] people to be willing to learn, right?
[16:35] And that's the hardest part. You know,
[16:37] you kind of have to, I guess, enforce
[16:40] the learning. And by that, I mean once
[16:42] Bitcoin's taught in schools, I guess
[16:44] that'll be the major turning point
[16:47] because the price will not be the major
[16:49] turning point. Like when Bitcoin goes to
[16:51] a million dollars within within the next
[16:53] four years, that's not really going to
[16:54] change the adoption speed because it
[16:58] already went to 100,000, no one really
[17:00] cared that much. A million people are
[17:02] not going to care that much. I think a
[17:04] lot of people think that the price is
[17:05] what's going to lead people to start
[17:06] coming to Bitcoin. Uh they would have
[17:08] cared a lot more when it was a $1 going
[17:11] to 100,000. You know, that's a 100,000x.
[17:15] You know, going from 100,000 to 10
[17:17] million is a smaller multiple. you know,
[17:20] uh, and people are not going to care as
[17:21] much. I think I I think that there's no
[17:24] one solution to getting people to care
[17:26] about Bitcoin or to understand Bitcoin.
[17:28] But unfortunately, the main thing is
[17:31] people typically don't change or they
[17:33] don't take action or they don't learn
[17:34] anything unless it's either uh kind of
[17:36] force-fed to them or if they're in a
[17:39] horrible situation where they look at
[17:41] their life and they have no other
[17:43] choice, you know, and that's kind of
[17:45] just new human nature, you know. If you
[17:46] have an addiction of some kind, like,
[17:49] oh, you just can't stop drinking and
[17:50] whatever it might be. Uh, most people
[17:52] don't change their habits until they're
[17:54] in a bad accident or until they ruin
[17:57] their relationships with people. You
[17:58] know, you kind of have to go all the way
[18:00] to the ledge in order for someone to
[18:02] kind of think about changing their ways
[18:05] or to open their mind or their heart to
[18:07] something new. Uh, and that's just the
[18:09] way a lot of people are. Not everyone, a
[18:11] lot of people are like that. So, I do
[18:13] think that maybe once Bitcoin is
[18:15] mandatory education and like different
[18:17] schools or whatever it might be, which
[18:19] that's a extremely long shot. They're
[18:21] doing that in El Salvador, but they
[18:22] already don't talk about normal money in
[18:24] American schools. So, that's a super
[18:26] long shot. uh or until people go to work
[18:29] and they realize, oh, me going to work
[18:31] doesn't do anything, you know, like it
[18:33] it literally doesn't make sense for me
[18:35] to even go to work uh because my paper
[18:37] dollars have been destroyed, you know,
[18:39] like a Weimar Germany type of situation,
[18:42] you know. I don't want that to be the
[18:44] case. I really don't. I want people to
[18:45] be proactive. I want them to watch shows
[18:47] like this to be able to understand what
[18:50] their money is uh turning into so that
[18:52] way they can transition without feeling
[18:54] all that pain. But markets always impose
[18:57] mass max pain max pain. And uh I want to
[19:00] try to avoid that. But I I I think
[19:02] that'll probably be the the suddenly the
[19:04] suddenly moment for Bitcoin will be very
[19:07] violent to the upside and it'll be very
[19:09] disruptive for the entire world.
[19:11] It it it's that all of the sudden we
[19:15] have a major pain point and the major
[19:17] pain point probably will come from the
[19:19] fiat system and drive people into the in
[19:22] the Bitcoin system. I love how a sailor
[19:25] put it in the early days. Now he he's
[19:27] not talking about that too much. Uh he
[19:29] talked about uh if there's like an
[19:31] oxygen mask and and you are in a room
[19:33] where the the oxygen is is sucked out at
[19:36] some point you don't ask the question,
[19:38] oh is that oxygen mask safe for me? Is
[19:41] that oxygen mask good for the
[19:42] environment? You just take it and and
[19:44] then breathe again before you die. And I
[19:46] think that's an amazing comparison to
[19:50] how Bitcoin adoption will go. There are
[19:52] some early people that see like, oh,
[19:54] like, okay, there's oxygen sucked out of
[19:57] the whole room. We have to prepare for
[19:59] that. Let's buy some oxygen masks. But
[20:02] some people will not do it till the very
[20:04] last moment. And then they only get the
[20:07] smaller oxygen mask, the worst oxygen
[20:09] mask. I mean, in Bitcoin terms, it's
[20:12] every bitcoin is the same. Every Satoshi
[20:13] is the same. So it's it's not doesn't
[20:15] make a whole lot uh it's not completely
[20:18] right but uh it it is uh interesting to
[20:21] think about that major point where all
[20:23] of a sudden people have to come uh and I
[20:26] think Roger also said it on my podcast
[20:29] where he said like 90% of people will
[20:33] still not care about Bitcoin even it's
[20:35] above a million. You need the pain
[20:38] point. People need a major pain point to
[20:40] actually like oh like oh oh I need
[20:42] Bitcoin. It's like that that kind of a
[20:45] thing. Yeah. Like again, if you don't
[20:47] know the problem, then you don't know
[20:50] the solution, you know, and um people
[20:52] still think, "Oh, well, the grocery
[20:54] prices are high because the grocery
[20:55] store is being really greedy and they
[20:56] just want to take my money." Um not
[20:59] exactly, you know, um you know, and and
[21:02] the price of everything is going up, you
[21:04] know. It's not that the the producer of
[21:06] everything on earth is just like super
[21:08] greedy and they're just trying to rob
[21:09] you. It's just that the value of your
[21:11] currency is going down. Okay? Your money
[21:14] is buying you less stuff because your
[21:16] money sucks now, you know? So, it is
[21:18] what it is. Uh, and more people are
[21:20] going to begin to understand that. And
[21:22] then realize that when you buy Bitcoin
[21:25] really, it's almost like it's incorrect
[21:26] to say you're buying Bitcoin in a way.
[21:28] What you're doing is you're doing a
[21:29] currency exchange, you know? So, if I
[21:31] have dollars and you have euros or
[21:33] whatever it might be, I'm technically
[21:35] not buying euros. The same way you're
[21:37] not buying US dollars. We're exchanging
[21:40] currency, you know. We're we're we're
[21:42] just exchanging the types of money, you
[21:43] know, when I buy Bitcoin by
[21:47] Yeah. You know, really, I'm I'm I'm
[21:48] exchanging I'm exchanging dollars for
[21:50] Satoshi's. I'm exchanging dollars for
[21:52] BTC. It's a currency exchange. It makes
[21:54] a lot of sense. And I I don't like the
[21:57] the frame because I starting to spend
[22:00] Bitcoin because most of my income is now
[22:03] in Bitcoin. So I have to spend some
[22:05] bitcoin and getting more and more on the
[22:07] bitcoin standard and then come people
[22:08] come like oh like you you should not
[22:10] sell your bitcoin. I'm not selling my
[22:11] bitcoin. I'm on a bitcoin standard and I
[22:14] use bitcoin as my money. I'm not selling
[22:19] bitcoin. It would be foolish to sell
[22:21] bitcoin. It is the right thing to do to
[22:24] spend your bitcoin. And um on that topic
[22:28] um maybe let's get a little a little bit
[22:30] in how do you look at spending bitcoin
[22:33] actually uh because now we're in the
[22:34] store of value phase obviously but uh um
[22:38] are you encouraging people to already
[22:40] spend the bitcoin obviously I'm a
[22:42] special case because my income is in
[22:43] bitcoin but uh most people don't have
[22:45] income in bitcoin so uh how do you look
[22:48] at spending bitcoin uh versus versus
[22:51] that I I spend my bitcoin you know um
[22:53] when it's time to pay someone at a
[22:56] You know, if my friend covers a tab and
[22:57] then we split it uh later, I pay them
[23:00] back using Strike. You know, I pay them
[23:02] back using Cash App. You know, that's
[23:03] just what I like to do. I'll send them
[23:05] Bitcoin and uh if they don't accept
[23:07] Bitcoin, I'll just be like, "Hey, don't
[23:09] even, you know, let's not cover the tab.
[23:12] Let's do separate checks, you know,
[23:13] because if I can't pay you in Bitcoin,
[23:16] then I won't be able to pay you, you
[23:18] know." Um, so that's kind of how I
[23:21] utilize the Bitcoin circular economy. If
[23:23] I'm ever buying merch from a Bitcoin
[23:25] store, if they have the option, I'm
[23:26] always using Bitcoin. And some people
[23:28] might say, well, it doesn't make sense.
[23:30] You're giving people thousands of
[23:31] dollars. If I give away someone 35,000
[23:34] Satoshi's to cover a $35 bill,
[23:37] technically I've given away $35,000 of
[23:40] value. Um, but one, I don't really care
[23:44] because I'm using the network. And two,
[23:46] yeah, I just gave someone $35,000 in the
[23:48] future. That's great. you know, they'll
[23:50] look back and they'll say, "Remember
[23:51] when you paid me for lunch that one
[23:52] time? I never sold those sats and now
[23:54] look how much they're worth." That's
[23:55] awesome, you know. So, I don't think
[23:57] anything negative can come from that.
[23:58] You know, that's the point of money. Uh,
[24:00] and uh, we can transition into talking
[24:02] about micro strategy after this, but
[24:05] Sailor has an interesting perspective on
[24:07] this. And this is my opinion. I think
[24:10] that he's playing the super genius role
[24:12] and he's not actually a believer of
[24:14] this, but what he likes to say is that
[24:16] Bitcoin is a commodity. It's an asset
[24:19] and it's not currency, right? It's not
[24:21] competing with the dollar. Bitcoin is
[24:23] not competing with the dollar. That's
[24:24] what he likes to say. I do not believe
[24:27] he believes that. I think he's trying to
[24:29] stay in the good graces of the United
[24:30] States. He doesn't want to poke the
[24:32] bear. He doesn't want to have to deal
[24:33] with the SEC and a bunch of people
[24:35] knocking on his door because he's
[24:37] acquiring this thing and promoting this
[24:38] thing and baltering this thing that
[24:40] might take down the dollar, right? So,
[24:42] he tries to disconnect them. I think
[24:44] Parker Lewis had an amazing article
[24:46] about this talking about how Bitcoin is
[24:49] currency and it is money, right? Uh in
[24:52] order to shorten his thing, the
[24:54] distinction between money and currency.
[24:56] Money is something that is emergent from
[25:00] society. Okay? There's no central ruler
[25:02] who says this is money. Central rulers
[25:05] are the ones who say this is currency.
[25:07] All right? Because currency has an
[25:09] issuer. An example is gold. Gold is
[25:12] money because of its properties. All
[25:14] right. However, how do you standardize
[25:17] gold? Do we use it by its weight? Is
[25:20] that how we kind of pay with it? Is it
[25:22] based on how it looks? Uh is it in the
[25:25] shape or whatever? The currency issuer
[25:27] in case the government the currency
[25:29] issuer takes the gold and they say,
[25:30] "Okay, listen. We're going to
[25:32] standardize this. We pay by the ounce
[25:34] and we also make coins. The coins are
[25:36] weighed out. Okay? They weigh this much
[25:39] and this is how you pay for things."
[25:40] blah blah blah blah. That's the
[25:42] difference between money and currency.
[25:44] Bitcoin is both money and currency
[25:47] because even though there's no central
[25:49] issuer of the currency, the currency is
[25:52] issued by the network. Okay? If you run
[25:54] a node, that's who's issuing the
[25:56] currency because we set the rules. Okay?
[25:59] There are no rulers, but there are
[26:01] rules. Each of us sets the rules. So, in
[26:05] that way, Bitcoin is a challenger to the
[26:08] dollar. Okay? And people don't want to
[26:10] say that because they think, "Oh, well,
[26:11] it's too slow. It's too expensive. It's
[26:13] too this. It's too that." That's why we
[26:14] build lightning. That's why we build all
[26:16] these tools on top of Bitcoin. Slowly
[26:18] but surely, we're working to dismantle
[26:20] the old system, not to embolden it or to
[26:23] build upon it or to make it stronger.
[26:25] It's a replacement to the old system.
[26:27] And that is the truth. That is the
[26:28] logical conclusion. Because if you don't
[26:31] do that, what you're doing is you're
[26:32] introducing a lot of friction into the
[26:35] transaction. If me and you want to
[26:37] transact and I have dollars, then I have
[26:39] to buy Bitcoin, then I have to give it
[26:40] to you in Bitcoin, and then you have to
[26:42] sell your Bitcoin back to dollars,
[26:43] that's not very efficient. All right,
[26:45] that's a lot of friction. If we just go
[26:47] Bitcoin to Bitcoin, that's the most
[26:49] efficient way to do things. And markets
[26:51] and individuals tend to like efficiency.
[26:54] So, since Bitcoin can do that, Bitcoin
[26:57] will do that. And that's my rant for the
[27:00] moment. I love that. Uh that that's
[27:03] really good. you you mentioned micro
[27:05] strategy uh and uh that there's a lot of
[27:08] interesting topics you already just said
[27:10] but just so that I don't forget it um
[27:12] micro strategy how how do you look I saw
[27:15] you made some videos also around that uh
[27:17] and it's quite fascinating that micro
[27:19] strategy has now I think half a million
[27:22] bitcoin they they now do look at that
[27:25] company how it looks now what they're
[27:28] doing and especially I think which is
[27:30] way more interesting is like what role
[27:33] will that company play in the future if
[27:36] that Bitcoin thing is actually what we
[27:38] think it is?
[27:40] Yes. And um me and you both have to work
[27:42] on this. They're called strategy now.
[27:44] It's going to be so
[27:48] strategy B. Yes. It's going to be so
[27:51] hard to not call it Micro Strategy. I
[27:53] still do it, you know, but that that's
[27:55] going to take years of unlearning. Um
[27:57] but strategy MSTR they are really the
[28:01] most valuable company in the world at
[28:03] this moment. Uh and the reason why is
[28:04] because they have the most real money in
[28:07] the world. Okay. They have the most
[28:09] value in the world right now. But people
[28:12] do not realize it yet. Okay. People like
[28:14] to think that markets are the first ones
[28:17] to understand things but they're not.
[28:18] Okay. There's a select few individuals
[28:20] who understand things before the broader
[28:22] market. And that's when we reach a
[28:24] critical mass of understanding and
[28:25] that's when all the big dollars start
[28:27] flowing in. Um but with Apple in the
[28:30] beginning Apple was mostly owned by
[28:32] retail investors when they first started
[28:34] launching. Big companies did not want to
[28:36] touch Apple. It was too risky. It didn't
[28:37] make sense. Okay. All the executives
[28:40] over at Microsoft were making fun of
[28:42] Apple. Uh saying that ah well you know
[28:44] their stupid little phone it doesn't
[28:46] even have a keyboard. You know it's
[28:47] never going to succeed. How are you
[28:49] going to send emails on it? Also it's
[28:50] too expensive and blah blah blah. They
[28:53] didn't understand. They didn't see the
[28:54] vision. There were a lot of retail
[28:55] investors who did understand it. They
[28:57] were in first and they made the greatest
[28:58] profit. Right now, we are the retail
[29:01] investors before all the other larger
[29:03] individuals start understanding that if
[29:05] you realize that 21 million Bitcoin is
[29:08] the totality of the network and Micro
[29:11] Strategy owns basically they're going to
[29:14] own over 1% of the entire network. then
[29:17] you would think, oh, you know what, that
[29:20] means that they have more than 1% of the
[29:22] entire world's value forever. You know,
[29:24] that's probably a good idea to own some
[29:26] of this company while it's still public.
[29:28] Uh, in the future, I can't say what
[29:31] Strategy will be doing. You know, I do
[29:33] believe they will be a Bitcoin bank, so
[29:35] they'll probably rebrand to Strategy
[29:37] Bank, which is why that B is on there
[29:38] now. Uh, Strategy Bank. And then, uh,
[29:41] they will issue Bitcoin back products.
[29:44] You can have a like a Bitcoin back
[29:46] mortgage. All right? So, you have your
[29:47] mortgage on your house, but also it can
[29:49] be collateralized on part of your house
[29:51] and then part of your Bitcoin holdings,
[29:53] right? Like I I can't even imagine what
[29:55] they'll be doing, but it'll be
[29:57] absolutely crazy. Uh they have more
[30:00] Bitcoin than the entire United States.
[30:03] So, I'm just saying I don't know what
[30:05] that means for the future, but all I do
[30:07] know is that I will be holding Strategy
[30:10] shares for a really long time. Let's
[30:12] take a break for a moment and appreciate
[30:14] the beauty that coin vigilante has made
[30:17] with the Bitcoin watches. Those watches
[30:20] are the most amazing, the most eleigent
[30:23] way of showing that you are a true
[30:26] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[30:28] dropped a completely new and amazing
[30:31] Genesis edition of their watch
[30:34] collections. You have the date of the
[30:36] first ever mined Bitcoin block in there
[30:39] and of course also the block height and
[30:42] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[30:45] the level of detail they put in in this
[30:48] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[30:50] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[30:53] down in the descriptions. I love those
[30:56] watches so so much. And now if you have
[30:59] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[31:02] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[31:04] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[31:06] to deal with that. The first way is you
[31:08] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[31:10] entry for you to get into the
[31:13] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[31:16] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[31:19] super simple and secure way. And if you
[31:22] check out the link in the description,
[31:24] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[31:27] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[31:30] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[31:33] partner in terms of how to get the most
[31:36] out of your sovereignty. They will
[31:38] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[31:41] that is perfect for your individual
[31:44] situation. They will show you how you
[31:46] can secure your own devices. Securing
[31:49] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[31:51] have to keep all your devices secure.
[31:54] One topic that is overlooked often is
[31:56] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[31:59] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[32:01] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[32:04] place already? And last but not least,
[32:06] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[32:08] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[32:10] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[32:16] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[32:18] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[32:21] be for the first time ever speaking at
[32:24] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[32:27] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[32:29] really looking forward to seeing all of
[32:31] you there. You can get your ticket in
[32:34] the link down in the description of
[32:36] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[32:38] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[32:42] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[32:44] there. I love that framing of bit of
[32:47] strategy is the most valuable company
[32:50] because it has the most real money in
[32:53] the world currently on the balance
[32:55] sheet. I think that's an amazing uh
[32:58] framing of that because it is true like
[33:02] they no one else like there there's
[33:04] Tesla with 10,000 bitcoin which is uh
[33:07] law for be small but they are the only
[33:10] 500 company that at least gets it that
[33:12] they have to hold bitcoin and there are
[33:14] some other bitcoin companies and stuff
[33:16] like that but they're far far beyond
[33:19] it's it's it's
[33:21] crazy America really has to step up it
[33:23] it would be hilarious If Strategy has
[33:26] more Bitcoin long term than than America
[33:29] has, that that would be just
[33:32] absolute that would be almost dangerous
[33:34] for
[33:35] Strategy. Yeah, I I think it's already
[33:37] dangerous, you know, and I think that's
[33:39] why Sailor tries to tread lightly. He
[33:41] tries to be politically neutral because
[33:44] Trump won't be around forever. we might
[33:46] switch from red to blue, you know, and
[33:48] if we go Democrat side, you want to make
[33:50] sure that you're not being too
[33:52] aggressively against or for one side.
[33:55] He's a pretty neutral guy, it seems
[33:56] like. And it's because he understands at
[33:58] any point uh your assets can be seized
[34:02] by people who are stronger than you,
[34:04] right? Who have more uh force than you.
[34:08] And because of that, you know, Bitcoin
[34:11] gives us the ability to kind of fight
[34:13] back in a way, you know, uh their
[34:15] Bitcoin is custodied by Coinbase and
[34:17] other companies, right? And companies
[34:19] can be pressured uh very very easily,
[34:21] you know, just monetary pressure. But
[34:23] with individuals, you know, it's really
[34:26] hard to try to send in the army to
[34:29] arrest a million people who are all
[34:31] holding Bitcoin on hardware wallets. So
[34:34] again, at the end of the day, Bitcoin is
[34:36] for individuals, it's for companies, and
[34:37] it's for countries, right? And the more
[34:40] individuals that there are involved in
[34:41] the network, the better because that
[34:43] means that the freedom virus that is
[34:46] Bitcoin is spreading, right? Uh if you
[34:48] just let all the countries and all the
[34:50] companies buy it up, that's not good.
[34:52] They already have all the money. They
[34:53] have all the force. Okay? Individuals
[34:55] have all the numbers. All right? We have
[34:56] the numbers. So, and also at the end of
[34:59] the day, what are countries made out of?
[35:01] What are companies made out of? They're
[35:02] made out of individuals. All right? So,
[35:04] the more individuals we can get on
[35:06] board, the allow the more safe and the
[35:08] more secure, the more decentralized
[35:10] Bitcoin becomes. Bitcoin's
[35:12] decentralization is what gives it its
[35:15] massive defense mechanism.
[35:17] Do you think Bitcoin will uh shrink
[35:20] governments and maybe even institutions
[35:22] long term? I do believe it could shrink
[35:25] governments uh long term, companies and
[35:28] institutions. I'm not too sure. Uh I
[35:31] think that AI and automation will do the
[35:33] job when it comes to like tightening
[35:36] companies. Um but in terms of
[35:38] governments, yeah, I do think so. I
[35:41] think there's a lot of governmental
[35:42] waste. You know, there's been a lot of
[35:44] focus on that. Uh but that's always been
[35:46] true. That's been obvious for a really
[35:47] long time. Governments just waste money
[35:50] because they don't have to work for
[35:51] money. Okay? All of the state's money is
[35:54] stolen. All right? It's taken from
[35:56] individuals. It's taken from people.
[35:58] otherwise they wouldn't have any money
[35:59] in the first place. That's the first
[36:01] thing. Uh so it's either directly taken
[36:03] from them in the form of taxes or tors
[36:05] or whatever it might be. Uh and then
[36:07] it's also indirectly stolen from them in
[36:08] the form of inflation. Since they have a
[36:11] monopoly on money creation, they can
[36:13] print the money whenever they see fit.
[36:16] This makes everyone poorer by extension
[36:18] and they don't consult the people. They
[36:20] don't ask their citizens. All right? And
[36:22] that's the problem with the printing
[36:24] press and the money printer. All right?
[36:26] Because back in the day, let's take it
[36:27] back to like World War I or even
[36:30] previous to that, um you kind of had to
[36:33] discuss with your people, hey, we're
[36:36] going to go to war. We're going to do a
[36:38] lot of these different things. We're
[36:39] going to cut back on spending here,
[36:41] here, and here, and we're going to do
[36:43] more spending here, here, and here. Are
[36:44] you guys with it? Let's go ahead and do
[36:46] it. Uh and a lot of people would either
[36:49] be for it or they would be against it,
[36:51] and then the country wouldn't be able to
[36:53] go and fight that war. You know, if
[36:55] everyone's against it, then you cannot
[36:56] just go and do that. But in today's
[36:59] society, since you have a money printer,
[37:01] what you can do is you can kind of make
[37:03] the decision unilaterally by yourself
[37:05] without consulting anyone. Hey, we're
[37:07] going to go to this war over here, and
[37:09] if anyone asks how we're going to fund
[37:10] it, don't even worry about it. All
[37:12] right? We're not even going to ask you
[37:14] guys for more taxes. Don't even worry
[37:15] about it. We're just going to print the
[37:16] money up. That's the invisible tax. And
[37:18] that's how we're able to fight these
[37:20] forever wars. That's how we're able to
[37:21] feed the military industrial complex,
[37:24] the prison industrial complex, and the
[37:26] welfare state all at once, right?
[37:28] Because all the money is just being
[37:29] created out of thin air to fund all
[37:31] these different uh liabilities that we
[37:33] have, all these different entitlements
[37:35] that we have, all these different wars
[37:37] that we have, and that keeps on going.
[37:39] On a Bitcoin standard, you can't just
[37:40] say, "Hey, we're going to print up the
[37:41] Bitcoin and go fight this war." No,
[37:43] there's an unfable cost. There's an
[37:45] unfable cost that you have to pay
[37:48] upfront. Uh, and that's what will stop,
[37:51] I think, a lot of violence on a global
[37:54] scale, you know, because you won't be
[37:55] able to fight forever wars, uh, because
[37:57] now they're going to be economically not
[37:59] feasible. All right? It won't even make
[38:01] sense to do so. Uh, on top of that, if
[38:03] you do fight the Great War, uh, you
[38:05] won't be able to steal their gold or
[38:07] anything like that. And if you do
[38:08] rebuild the cities and take all their
[38:10] real estate or take all their land, it
[38:12] won't be as valuable as if you would
[38:14] have just used that energy to mine
[38:16] Bitcoin, you know? So you're
[38:18] demonetizing violence on so many
[38:20] different fronts that war just becomes
[38:22] economically not a good idea. You know,
[38:25] it becomes really stupid to go to war
[38:27] with someone on a Bitcoin standard. It's
[38:28] interesting. So it's it's in a way
[38:31] stopping violence on on many different
[38:34] layers even if when I hear it right.
[38:37] Yeah. And I there's still going to be
[38:38] violence. I'm not saying that we're
[38:39] going to have like just like heaven on
[38:41] earth and everyone's going to have peace
[38:42] and sing kumbaya. But I am saying that
[38:45] it's not going to make as much sense
[38:47] economically. Like you're not going to
[38:49] get super super rich by deciding to go
[38:51] fight a 20-year war uh over in some
[38:54] other country for some reason. You know,
[38:56] it just won't make sense. You know,
[38:58] it'll make you really second guess like,
[39:00] hey, we can't just make the money out of
[39:01] thin air. There's going to be a massive
[39:04] cost incurred on our country and on our
[39:06] citizens that we won't be able to fake
[39:08] or blame on anyone else. So, we might
[39:11] want to second guess this. We might want
[39:12] to use diplomacy on this one, guys.
[39:14] Let's see what agreement we can come to.
[39:16] This might not be a fight that's worth
[39:18] fighting. All right? Especially when you
[39:19] come out of it. It's a it's I believe
[39:22] it's called a pirate vic victory. Like,
[39:24] you you go in there, you fight, but you
[39:26] don't really come back with anything.
[39:27] You don't come back with any gains, you
[39:29] know? You you come back with only
[39:30] losses, you know? So even if you win, it
[39:33] just makes not that much sense. It's not
[39:35] it's not something that would be pursued
[39:38] as much as it is today. Yeah. It's like
[39:40] uh who's the winner in a fist fight?
[39:42] Both are losers. Both both damaged
[39:44] themselves uh in in the process and and
[39:48] in that way it's also with wars. In the
[39:50] fiat world, they benefit from it. Um but
[39:53] in a bitcoin world, they don't. What do
[39:56] you think outside of what we just
[39:58] already discussed? What do you think is
[39:59] the implications of Bitcoin on society?
[40:03] Um, yeah, I'm I'm glad you asked that.
[40:06] It's uh the implications are absolutely
[40:08] massive. That's an entire show by
[40:09] itself. But to kind of keep it brief, I
[40:12] think in terms of violence to
[40:14] individuals, right, Bitcoin makes it
[40:17] again just not that feasible to start
[40:19] robbing people. All right, it doesn't
[40:20] really make that much sense, you know,
[40:22] because if you run up on someone and you
[40:24] say, "Hey, give me give me your wallet."
[40:26] you know, yeah, you can easily just take
[40:27] their wallet, take all the money out of
[40:28] it, take their credit cards out of it,
[40:29] and then leave. You know, that's that
[40:32] happens. Um, you could break into
[40:34] someone's house, like, "Hey, I know that
[40:35] this guy has a safe in his house. He has
[40:37] a lot of gold in his house under his
[40:39] mattress. Let's go in there, run up
[40:41] armed robbery, uh, house invasion." You
[40:43] know, that happens on a Bitcoin standard
[40:45] where everyone is using like a form of
[40:48] multi-IG. Uh, it just doesn't make sense
[40:51] to try robbing people because you cannot
[40:53] rob them, you know. So again, for the
[40:55] people who don't know, a multi-IG would
[40:57] be something like I have one of the keys
[41:00] to my Bitcoin. Robin has one of the keys
[41:02] to my Bitcoin. And then Coinbase has one
[41:05] of the keys to my Bitcoin. Swan has one
[41:06] of the keys to my Bitcoin. Some company
[41:08] has the keys to my Bitcoin. And I need
[41:10] two of those three keys in order to make
[41:13] a transaction, right? Um, and the other
[41:17] two actors, like Robin and River
[41:19] Financial, are not in cahoots with each
[41:22] other. They don't even know that they're
[41:23] holding the key for me, right? Uh so I
[41:26] if I ever want to try to transact, then
[41:29] I will use my key and then I'll reach
[41:31] out to Robin or to River in order to
[41:34] facilitate the movement of my Bitcoin.
[41:36] My one key is not enough. So if someone
[41:38] tries to rob me, it literally doesn't
[41:40] make sense because it's like, dude, even
[41:41] if I wanted to give you the money, I
[41:42] don't have the other key to move my
[41:45] Bitcoin. I don't even have the access to
[41:46] it. We would have to go through so many
[41:48] hoops to try to make this work, to
[41:49] facilitate this trade. it does not make
[41:51] sense for you to try to use violence to
[41:53] take my money because it's locked in
[41:55] cyerspace where you cannot touch it. You
[41:57] know, um that's true for individuals,
[41:59] that's true for companies, that's true
[42:01] for countries. All right? There is no
[42:03] one in the United States or there's
[42:05] there the United States can't be like,
[42:06] "Oh, you know, we're going to go freeze
[42:08] Russia's Bitcoin because they're being
[42:10] mean to us." No, you you can't do that.
[42:13] And Russia cannot do it to the United
[42:14] States. Russia cannot do that to
[42:16] Ukraine. Russia can't do that to anyone.
[42:18] All right? your Bitcoin is your Bitcoin
[42:20] and that's it. Uh and if you're doing
[42:22] multisig, you literally cannot get your
[42:26] Bitcoin stolen from you by force, you
[42:28] know. Uh even the fact that let's just
[42:31] say like 20% of people use multisig and
[42:34] then everyone else just has their keys
[42:35] on a normal hardware device or like on
[42:37] their phone or something. Um the process
[42:40] of going through trying to take
[42:42] someone's Bitcoin is just so convoluted
[42:44] and difficult and strange that again
[42:48] you're just disincentivized to be
[42:50] violent to people. Uh on top of that you
[42:52] could be like here here's my Bitcoin. I
[42:54] give you like a 100,000 Satoshi's.
[42:56] That's my dummy wallet. That's my baby
[42:58] wallet. That's my just in case wallet
[43:00] where if I get robbed here you go you
[43:02] know and you get jipped into just taking
[43:05] 01% of my actual holdings. you know, it
[43:07] it's just not feasible. Like violence
[43:09] just becomes stupid. It becomes really
[43:12] really stupid because you can't even
[43:14] economically benefit from violence at
[43:16] that point. So you get 100,000 sats
[43:18] eventually they trace them anyway once
[43:20] you try spinning them and uh then you
[43:22] just go to jail, you know? So it's like
[43:23] it doesn't make sense for individuals.
[43:25] Um and that's just on the violence part
[43:27] of things. Uh really quickly I want to
[43:29] touch on how it affects relationships,
[43:32] right? And this is something that I'm
[43:33] still thinking about. I'm still writing
[43:34] about and I'm going to make videos about
[43:36] this. But when you think about it, um,
[43:39] when it comes to like men and women and
[43:42] their relationships, we want to have
[43:45] something that is stable, right? We want
[43:47] to have something that's going to be
[43:48] around for the future, right? Uh, and
[43:51] Bitcoin allows us to kind of plan out
[43:53] our relationships a lot better because
[43:55] it gives us a lot more certainty going
[43:57] into the future. A lot of young people
[43:59] today, they're not too sure about having
[44:01] kids and all that because everything's
[44:03] just so expensive. How are we going to
[44:04] be able to afford a kid? What are we
[44:06] even going to do about the kid? You
[44:07] know, all that good stuff. But when you
[44:09] have Bitcoin, you can kind of be more
[44:11] confident going into the future. You're
[44:12] like energized about the future. You're
[44:14] want to you want to stack harder for
[44:16] your kids, you know, for your grandkids.
[44:18] And that's like it makes you energized
[44:20] to be like, "Hey, you know what? Let's
[44:21] go ahead and start this family. Like,
[44:23] let's go ahead and like get together,
[44:24] plan for the future, and like, you know,
[44:26] let's start homesteading and all this
[44:28] other stuff." like it just changes the
[44:29] way that you view the world, you know,
[44:31] and and it's such a much more positive
[44:33] view of the future that you get really
[44:36] excited about the present because every
[44:37] single day you get a step closer into
[44:40] the future, you know what I mean? Uh and
[44:42] I think Bitcoin just kind of gives
[44:43] individuals hope in a world that's very
[44:45] hopeless, right? Especially for young
[44:47] people. We feel the greatest effects
[44:50] from inflation because when the Fed says
[44:52] that the inflation rate is 2%, that just
[44:55] means it's 2% for this year or for this
[44:57] month. You add that up throughout
[44:59] history, we're actually facing hundreds
[45:01] of percentage points of inflation that
[45:03] have stacked up over time, which is the
[45:05] reason why our cheeseburgers cost $10.
[45:08] And back in the day, you could buy it
[45:09] for a nickel, you know? So, we feel the
[45:11] compounding effects of inflation. And
[45:13] that takes away our ability to own a
[45:14] house. It takes away our ability to
[45:16] start a family. It takes away our
[45:18] ability to provide for our kids. It
[45:19] takes away our ability to provide for
[45:21] our elderly parents. Okay? The people
[45:23] who have social security, they're having
[45:25] a hard time making it, you know? So
[45:26] every single generation is dealing with
[45:28] this problem all at once. But we have so
[45:31] many years left in our lives as Gen
[45:32] Zers, as Gen Alpha that we have to deal
[45:34] with as we go forward. Bitcoin lets us
[45:36] plan for those future years. That's
[45:38] amazing. I love the way of like how
[45:42] different generations and how different
[45:44] people look actually at Bitcoin. And it
[45:47] would be fun. Maybe we can do it
[45:49] actually in that podcast of getting you
[45:51] uh and someone that is like 65 or like I
[45:54] had even people on that were uh Steve I
[45:57] think was the oldest with like 75. I
[46:00] hope I got the the age right of of you
[46:02] Steve if you're listening. So uh it
[46:04] would be really fun to like compare on
[46:07] on how you how you look at at Bitcoin.
[46:09] It was just a thought that I had with
[46:10] the last sentence that you just said in
[46:12] in my head that that I think it would be
[46:15] a fun thing to to do like the Gen C like
[46:18] a millennials maybe like put a boomer
[46:20] baby boomers in there make like a panel.
[46:24] Yes. Get a jinzier, a Gen X, a
[46:26] millennial, a boomer and uh just, you
[46:29] know, see exactly how they view the
[46:30] world and how Bitcoin has affected their
[46:32] life. I think that'd be awesome. I'll be
[46:34] there for sure. I I I will try to to to
[46:37] set something up in the in the future.
[46:38] Really cool. Um uh we're already coming
[46:41] closer to the end, but I really want to
[46:43] touch on the strategic Bitcoin reserve
[46:46] and game theory for for a moment. What
[46:49] what's your thoughts? What is the
[46:50] implications um in the short and medium
[46:52] term for that strategic Bitcoin reserve
[46:54] that America just announced and maybe
[46:57] even like build out with like buying
[46:59] actual more Bitcoin? Uh I think the bill
[47:02] is suggest 200,000 per year for the next
[47:04] like 5 years or something like that.
[47:06] Yes. So uh quick distinction there's a
[47:09] difference between the executive order
[47:10] that went through and the bill that is
[47:12] not yet passed. Right. So the current
[47:15] executive order is instructing the
[47:18] secretary of the treasury uh and a
[47:20] couple other agencies in the United
[47:22] States. They're telling them to hold the
[47:24] Bitcoin that we already have. Okay.
[47:26] audit the Bitcoin to make sure we know
[47:28] exactly how much we do have and also
[47:30] find budgetneutral ways to buy more
[47:33] Bitcoin, right? And that just means ways
[47:35] that don't increase the deficit. Okay?
[47:37] Ways that don't require us to print more
[47:39] money. That's what they're trying to do.
[47:41] Uh currently, the bill that's in
[47:43] Congress, if that does get passed, I
[47:45] believe uh Lumis wants us to try to
[47:48] acquire 1 million Bitcoin over the
[47:50] course of five years. All right? So,
[47:53] 200,000 Bitcoin per year. And um that's
[47:57] about the rate that Micro Strategy has
[47:59] been acquiring Bitcoin at. Uh I do
[48:01] believe that I I did it again. Strategy,
[48:03] I think Strategy will speed up their
[48:06] acquisition of Bitcoin and I think that
[48:09] the United States, if they can get this
[48:10] bill passed, uh might just be able to
[48:14] come in second behind Sailor. I do think
[48:17] that it's too late for the US to
[48:19] overtake Sailor if they take on a modest
[48:23] strategy of acquiring a million Bitcoin.
[48:26] And a million is truly modest. A, uh, a
[48:28] a triple maxi type of acquisition would
[48:31] be 3 million, 4 million, 5 million, uh,
[48:34] which is about 20% of the network,
[48:36] right? Uh, that would be a aggressive
[48:38] strategy. And I think that they probably
[48:40] won't go with that. They'll probably
[48:41] just try acquiring a million. uh no
[48:44] guarantees on that because it's going to
[48:46] be hard to get that bill passed. But
[48:47] what I think it means is that Bitcoin
[48:50] has been further legitimized in the eyes
[48:52] of different governments. All right? All
[48:54] the people who are followers, all the
[48:56] people who are sheep, right, who wait
[48:58] for the United States to do something
[48:59] until they say it's okay, those people
[49:02] have now had their eyes open. They're
[49:04] probably going to be reaching out to
[49:05] different people trying to see about how
[49:07] they can invest harder into ETFs, how
[49:09] they can start their own mining
[49:11] operations in their country the same way
[49:12] that the country of Bhutan has been able
[49:15] to do, the same way that El Salvador has
[49:17] been able to do. You know, uh they're
[49:18] probably going to start looking into
[49:20] more Bitcoin infrastructure. All right,
[49:23] Bitcoin backed bonds, Bitcoin products,
[49:25] buying Bitcoin directly, posting their
[49:27] wallets online for other countries and
[49:29] other individuals for their citizens to
[49:31] see. the same way that El Salvador has a
[49:34] BTC tracker, you know, I think all that
[49:36] stuff is going to get kicked into high
[49:37] gear. And by 2030, I think it's going to
[49:40] be weird for a country to not be
[49:43] pursuing some sort of Bitcoin strategy.
[49:45] I think that'll be the oddity. It'll be
[49:47] strange for you if you're not doing
[49:49] that. Uh, and some people might say
[49:51] that's impossible. That's only like 5
[49:53] years away. A lot has happened in 5
[49:55] years. Go back to 2020. Okay? You think
[49:57] we'd be talking about a strategic
[49:58] reserve for the United States?
[50:00] Absolutely not. You you would think we'd
[50:02] be talking about Michael Sailor holding
[50:03] 500,000 Bitcoin. Absolutely not. So
[50:06] things can change very quickly. Five
[50:07] years is not a lot of time, but a lot
[50:09] can happen. And I think five years from
[50:11] now, almost every country, every major
[50:13] country will have some sort of Bitcoin
[50:14] strategic reserve. They'll be mining,
[50:16] they'll be buying, they'll be holding.
[50:18] Very true. And even inside of the
[50:21] there's this website. I don't know. Do
[50:22] do you know that? I will I will show
[50:24] you. I think it's it's a it's a really
[50:26] cool one. If if you don't know about
[50:28] that website,
[50:29] um let me just pull it quickly up for
[50:33] you. Is it bitcoin laws.io? Oh, you you
[50:37] you know it of course like you are you
[50:39] are informed.
[50:41] Yes, let's go. Uh this one I mean yeah
[50:45] that that that one is is great. It
[50:48] really updates.
[50:50] Uh I looked I looked today in there. I
[50:54] look yesterday in there and right now
[50:57] and it's three times different
[50:58] statistics. So like they actually like
[51:00] really on it with with updating it.
[51:03] That's an amazing um not only America,
[51:06] not only nation states, but also within
[51:09] America, the race to uh state reserves
[51:12] is on and and and that's just that's
[51:15] just amazing to to see the those races
[51:18] and hopefully we have more and more that
[51:20] actually uh come to the finish line
[51:23] there. That's that's amazing. Yeah. But
[51:25] if you know, I was like you you should
[51:28] know about it if you don't know about
[51:29] it. Yes. It's a super cool website. the
[51:32] guy who designed it, he's working hard
[51:34] every day. His team is working hard.
[51:36] They keep it updated pretty fast. So,
[51:38] shout out to this guy. Shout out to
[51:40] bitcoinlaws.io. Uh, super cool website.
[51:42] And again, it's not just about the
[51:44] United States because this mostly just
[51:45] tracks the US and the states. Uh, but
[51:48] there are smaller countries like again,
[51:49] most people don't know what Bhutan is.
[51:51] They don't know where that is. Uh, but
[51:53] that small country has more Bitcoin than
[51:56] El Salvador. They have like three times
[51:57] more, you know? So, that's insane. They
[52:00] didn't buy any. They've been mining it.
[52:02] How many other countries have been
[52:04] mining in secret? You know, we don't
[52:06] really know. You know, the UAE, the the
[52:09] Saudi Arabia, you know what I mean?
[52:11] There's so many different Middle Eastern
[52:12] countries who could have been grinding
[52:14] and building out Bitcoin infrastructure
[52:15] and mining bitcoins this whole time, you
[52:18] know? Uh they could have 5,000, 6,000.
[52:20] We don't even know because you don't
[52:22] necessarily have to disclose uh
[52:24] something like that. You don't have to
[52:25] disclose how much gold you hold or
[52:26] anything like that, you know. So, it's
[52:28] the same with Bitcoin. And uh once the
[52:30] supply shock does come, people are going
[52:32] to feel it. It's going to happen almost
[52:34] instantly because these countries aren't
[52:37] getting Bitcoin to then sell it in 2
[52:39] years. Uh especially not at this stage
[52:40] of the game. Only individuals are doing
[52:42] that for the most part. These countries
[52:44] want to hold it for decades. With Putin,
[52:46] it's interesting because they disclosed
[52:48] 2024 that they hold Bitcoin and how much
[52:50] they did. Before they did not disclose
[52:52] it, but they started in 2019. So they
[52:57] have been accumulating and holding
[52:59] Bitcoin for 5 years before they
[53:03] disclosed it. How many countries are out
[53:05] there that already do that for like two,
[53:08] three, four, maybe even like 5 years and
[53:10] just never told anyone?
[53:13] Yes. And like again, they were able to
[53:15] get like 17,000 bitcoins in about 5
[53:18] years. What happens with all the
[53:19] countries who just started mining in
[53:21] secret now, right? They just started
[53:24] building the infrastructure. They're
[53:25] just now starting to mine. And then 5
[53:27] years from now, 2030, we're going to
[53:28] look back and they'll be like, "Oh yeah,
[53:30] this other small country, they also have
[53:32] like 17,000 Bitcoin. Oh yeah, you know,
[53:34] Poland, Poland has like 20,000 Bitcoin,
[53:36] by the way. They've been uh slowly
[53:38] accumulating it by mining and then by
[53:40] buying it as well, you know, like that
[53:42] that is definitely going to happen.
[53:44] We're going to start seeing that happen
[53:45] more and more. And the reason why is
[53:47] because countries don't want to get
[53:49] economically locked out of the financial
[53:52] future, okay? Of of the digital economy,
[53:55] okay? They don't want to have zero of
[53:57] the internet money, right? They want to
[53:59] have some of the internet money. And
[54:01] since you can't make anymore and since
[54:03] no one can control it, it's probably a
[54:05] good idea to get some just in case it
[54:07] catches on.
[54:09] Is it true Satoshi? I love that.
[54:13] By the way, I just I I just saw that um
[54:17] Budhan has around 700,000
[54:20] um people living there. That's half of
[54:23] Vienna. And Vienna is already very small
[54:25] in terms of like a global scale. That's
[54:28] amazing. Yeah. Like their Satoshi's per
[54:31] person, like the amount of Bitcoin per
[54:33] person for Bhutan is crazy, you know.
[54:36] It's actually amazing, you know. So
[54:39] that's another metric you have to think
[54:40] about. How many Satoshi's could each
[54:43] person have if you divided the country's
[54:45] holdings up? And Bhutan is in the lead
[54:47] by a long shot. So, countries should be
[54:50] thinking about BTC per person. That's
[54:53] what they should be thinking about in
[54:54] the long term. I love that. Really cool.
[54:56] Um, let's before uh we have one uh more
[55:00] question that I ask each and every one
[55:01] of my guests. I think I asked it last
[55:03] time already when you were on the show.
[55:05] Um, what we can learn from you besides
[55:07] Bitcoin. Um, do you have something else?
[55:11] I I'm not sure what you said last time
[55:13] actually. Uh, I think I talked about
[55:15] like fitness and about like
[55:19] Yeah, just trying to like do what you
[55:22] want to do, just like trying, you know.
[55:24] Um, but if you have any other questions
[55:26] that a guest has given you before, I'd
[55:28] love to answer a new one. Oh, yeah. Uh,
[55:31] the the end routine we we we definitely
[55:33] have. Uh, because we have two question.
[55:35] The first question is always like, "What
[55:37] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin?"
[55:39] That's every guest gets that. But I'm
[55:41] trying to figure out what I should do
[55:43] with guests that have been returning
[55:45] because like maybe you don't have things
[55:48] with it. But I will just give you the
[55:49] question from the previous guest. And
[55:50] the question from previous guest is
[55:52] aides from gains, what is the number one
[55:54] thing Bitcoin has done to improve your
[55:56] life?
[55:58] I see. Um, I would say the number one
[56:01] thing is that it just changes your life
[56:05] completely. And I think a lot of people
[56:07] will agree with this. There is a before
[56:09] Bitcoin version of yourself and there's
[56:11] an after Bitcoin version of yourself.
[56:13] And it genuinely orange pills you, it
[56:16] red pills you, whatever you want to call
[56:17] it. You know, you see the world in such
[56:19] a different lens. All right?
[56:21] you truly make the distinction between
[56:25] being an NPC and being actually woke,
[56:29] you know, and not in like the liberal
[56:31] like dye your hair kind of way. I mean
[56:34] woke as in like in in tune with, you
[56:38] know, more so who you are and also in
[56:40] tune to how the world actually works and
[56:42] the things that actually go on in our
[56:44] world. You know, having an interest in
[56:46] understanding how the banking system
[56:48] robs people every single day. having an
[56:50] interest in how governments do all this
[56:52] shady and slimy stuff every single day.
[56:54] Uh looking more into different things
[56:56] that have been labeled conspiracy
[56:58] theories, but they're actually just
[56:59] things that are true that have been said
[57:01] too early, right? Um it's it's just a
[57:04] completely refraraming of the way that
[57:07] you think and the way that you see the
[57:08] world. And it be it turns you into
[57:10] someone who actually wants to try to
[57:12] think for themselves. Because when it
[57:14] came to me understanding Bitcoin, I
[57:16] spent months trying to understand how it
[57:18] could go to zero and how it was fake,
[57:21] you know, uh, and when I was unable to
[57:23] come to any solid conclusions about how
[57:26] Bitcoin could not work, I figured that
[57:28] it only makes sense as a rational person
[57:30] to try to empower the network to become
[57:34] part of the network. And that's what
[57:36] Bitcoin has done. And because Bitcoin is
[57:38] unlike anything else we've ever seen,
[57:39] it's very easy for anyone on the outside
[57:41] looking in if they still get all their
[57:43] media from the mainstream, whatever's on
[57:46] the TV 24/7, whatever that might be. And
[57:48] if they say, "Oh, Bitcoin's just beanie
[57:51] babies. It's just tulips. It's just a
[57:53] scam. They just run with that. They
[57:54] don't ask any questions. Being a
[57:56] Bitcoiner at your heart is just asking
[57:58] questions, right? And then when you're
[58:00] able to ask those questions, get a
[58:01] couple answers, you're consistently
[58:03] getting a lot of the same stuff. You're
[58:04] going to your different sources. you're
[58:06] doing everything you can to try to find
[58:07] the true truth. Then uh you're able to I
[58:11] I would say call yourself a true
[58:13] Bitcoiner. All right. Uh there's going
[58:15] to be a lot of voices pushing back on
[58:16] you. You might feel a little isolated.
[58:18] You might feel like you are getting uh
[58:20] treated a lot differently than most
[58:22] people. They might make fun of you,
[58:24] whatever it might be. But they did the
[58:25] same thing for people who didn't
[58:27] understand the internet back in the day.
[58:29] They called it a scam. They said it was
[58:30] for criminals. They said it was lame. It
[58:32] was for nerds. Whatever it might be.
[58:34] Now, if they didn't have the internet,
[58:36] they wouldn't be able to survive. Okay?
[58:38] Most people, you take their little phone
[58:39] away, take their internet away, they
[58:40] can't make it. It'll it'll be like that
[58:42] for Bitcoin in about 20 years. I really
[58:44] do I really do believe. I 100% agree
[58:48] with you. Thank you so much, John. Um,
[58:50] before I let you go, where can people
[58:52] find you, reach out to you, ask you
[58:54] questions? You have a YouTube channel
[58:55] and other channels also. Yes. Yes, you
[58:58] can find me on Noster Jenzbtc. Uh, you
[59:02] can find me on X, the same label, the
[59:05] same handle, and even on YouTube, Gen Z
[59:07] BTC. Uh, I'm going to start making a lot
[59:09] more short form content to try to break
[59:11] down concepts because jumping right into
[59:14] Bitcoin, it can be a little bit tough.
[59:15] But if you're looking to get started,
[59:17] uh, and hear it from someone who has a
[59:20] little bit of a big personality uh, and
[59:22] an interesting way of saying things, if
[59:23] you enjoy anime or anything like that,
[59:25] I'm your guy for sure. So, I'm going to
[59:27] continue trying to bring Bitcoin
[59:28] education and just personal finance and
[59:30] different financial education to all the
[59:33] young people around the world. And you
[59:34] don't have to be young to watch my
[59:35] channel. You know, you can be an old
[59:37] head as well. It doesn't matter to me.
[59:39] Thank you so much. Um, it was a pleasure
[59:42] talking with you al as always. Thank you
[59:44] so much for for for taking the time.
[59:46] Also, thank you so much for everyone
[59:47] that is watching and listening for
[59:48] joining us today. As always, I'll be
[59:50] back tomorrow with another episode.
[59:52] Bye-bye.
