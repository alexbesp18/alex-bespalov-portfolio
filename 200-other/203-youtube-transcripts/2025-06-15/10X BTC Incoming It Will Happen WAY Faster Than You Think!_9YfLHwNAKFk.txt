[00:00] it's going to be a lot easier to go from
[00:01] here to a million I really thought we'd
[00:03] see probably between like 225 to 285,000
[00:07] on this next cycle bitcoin's going to a
[00:09] million a coin this 25 it's possible I'd
[00:12] have to say that everything changed on
[00:14] Election Day a lot of bitcoiners are
[00:16] still sleeping on this I'm 90% certain
[00:18] that within 48 Hours of him taking
[00:21] office we're going to see an executive
[00:23] order signed creating a strategic
[00:25] Bitcoin Reserve you know you don't have
[00:26] enough Bitcoin right now we're going to
[00:28] continue and when we cross that ASM
[00:30] again stand the FBI because we are going
[00:33] to take off you can create generational
[00:35] wealth you can change your family's
[00:37] trajectory completely by stacking as
[00:40] much Bitcoin as you can get on the 25th
[00:42] on Christmas Day the Russian Finance
[00:44] Minister on National Television said he
[00:47] confirmed that Russia is already
[00:49] settling global trade using Bitcoin I
[00:52] just don't think people understand how
[00:53] fast this can happen when you say things
[00:55] happen suddenly that sudden part it just
[00:57] takes people by surprise $10,000 if you
[01:00] took it Forward 20 years it's $64
[01:03] [Music]
[01:07] million hi George how you doing
[01:09] everything fine on your end oh it's
[01:11] going great I'm glad that we had a
[01:13] chance toh talk again it's been a little
[01:15] while since I've seen you and and there
[01:16] are a lot of really exciting things that
[01:18] are going on right now you know I don't
[01:20] think that people are I don't think
[01:21] people are bullish enough I don't I just
[01:23] I still don't understand but for some
[01:26] reason people just seem to be kind of
[01:28] asleep at the wheel with what's
[01:29] happening here in the next 18 days and
[01:32] that's you know in 18 days uh
[01:34] president-elect Trump is going to put
[01:36] his hand on the Bible become president
[01:38] Trump and he's given us some indications
[01:40] that we're going to see some massive
[01:41] changes going forward in uh the Bitcoin
[01:44] space and for Bitcoin too and for the
[01:46] country absolutely and when this comes
[01:49] out it's probably just two weeks uh to
[01:51] to that because I think it's 20th of
[01:53] January I think it's inauguration that's
[01:56] correct uh so today we are recording at
[01:59] what is it 4 January so like next week
[02:02] we'll be only two weeks to there um it's
[02:05] also interesting for me how outside of
[02:08] the Bitcoin World nobody cares about
[02:10] that 100K Milestone I thought it it will
[02:12] be
[02:13] bigger you know the thing is I mean for
[02:18] those of us who've been in the space for
[02:19] a while we're all you know we've all
[02:20] been waiting for the 100K but at the
[02:24] same time you know I felt the last I
[02:28] felt like in our last cycle that we went
[02:30] prematurely that we were cut uh short in
[02:33] our our cycle Peak you know there were a
[02:35] lot of things that were going on uh I
[02:37] didn't understand how important fby
[02:39] reporting was you know that's changed
[02:41] now uh the the accounting rules for
[02:44] Bitcoin on a treasury company's balance
[02:46] has been changed from intangible asset
[02:49] to a fair market value so even though
[02:53] micro strategy came into the space in 20
[02:55] and we were all excited about it we
[02:57] thought the institutions were arriving I
[02:59] mean I was wrong I I actually said
[03:01] institutions are coming totally wrong uh
[03:04] they did not arrive uh fby was one of
[03:07] the reasons but there were other things
[03:10] going on too for instance I didn't
[03:12] understand how important chokepoint 2.0
[03:16] was in restricting Capital excess for
[03:18] companies that were trying to enter the
[03:20] space I mean the Biden Administration
[03:22] really uh doubled down on that from
[03:24] choke choke point
[03:26] 1.0 and it's just made a big difference
[03:29] in in uh I think the the outcome in the
[03:33] 21 cycle and then last but not least you
[03:35] know the gbtc premium that went to a
[03:38] discount that probably was the single
[03:40] biggest uh change in our space and with
[03:44] all of those and the fact that the rise
[03:46] was so rapid up there I think we just
[03:49] ran out of steam but I was surprised I
[03:52] really thought it would go higher I
[03:53] thought we'd see 100K last time so now I
[03:56] just think maybe it's like we're making
[03:57] up for L time and maybe will just expect
[04:00] this I I'll tell you one thing it's
[04:02] going to be a lot easier to go from here
[04:04] to a million uh you'll see I mean that's
[04:07] only a 10x and Bitcoin does that so yeah
[04:12] so so you're saying uh it's it's easier
[04:14] to go from uh 100K to a million then
[04:18] from like 10K or some like smaller
[04:20] amount from there it it would it's going
[04:23] to get easier and easier as time goes by
[04:26] based upon liquidity and how big our
[04:29] market cap is you know when we get to a
[04:32] five Six Trillion market cap that's
[04:34] going to be massive because it's going
[04:36] to allow you know right now institutions
[04:40] are with us I mean we set up the trip
[04:42] wires they are flares are in the air
[04:44] they're inside the perimeter the enemy
[04:46] is inside here with us now institutions
[04:48] big companies are here but it's nothing
[04:51] compared to what we're going to see uh
[04:53] from the warehouses and asset allocators
[04:56] once our market cap gets big enough so
[04:59] even even though it's two million or two
[05:01] trillion it's really not as big as it
[05:04] needs to be to accelerate where we're
[05:06] going to go but it's going to it's
[05:08] happening it's G to happen I'm looking
[05:11] really a lot forward to the gold
[05:13] flippening moment where we kind of catch
[05:16] up to the gold market cap will it's hard
[05:18] to say what price that will be because
[05:21] gold is also uh appreciating against the
[05:24] US dollar at the same moment it's like a
[05:26] moving Target um is that a meaningful
[05:29] when when Bitcoin is finally the biggest
[05:31] asset in the world now we're like number
[05:33] eight or something like that it's huge
[05:35] it's just huge I mean and and look at
[05:38] Silver you know Silver's been around for
[05:41] thousands of years and we we are past
[05:43] Silver's market cap it's going to happen
[05:46] with gold you know I uh I've held gold
[05:50] in the past I like gold I uh you know i'
[05:54] I've uh held gold ETFs gold miners uh I
[05:58] recently within a year and and a half
[06:00] ago I liquidated all the gold that I had
[06:02] left and everything's in Bitcoin now and
[06:05] in fact all my wealth is in Bitcoin or a
[06:07] proxy micro strategy for uh Bitcoin but
[06:11] otherwise I'm all in Bitcoin but what I
[06:14] was going to say is getting back to your
[06:15] question there you know if if you look
[06:18] at the history of
[06:19] gold and I know bitcoiners will
[06:22] appreciate this and hopefully we won't
[06:23] have any of them out there throwing
[06:25] rocks at Gold people
[06:27] because you know it's so weird that
[06:30] we've got this antipathy between gold
[06:33] and Bitcoin and when you think about it
[06:37] real gold bugs the people that really
[06:40] believe in sound money and believe that
[06:43] gold was an alternative to Fiat these
[06:47] people are really bitcoiners I mean
[06:49] they're bitcoiners they just don't know
[06:51] it yet and I think when we see people
[06:53] like Peter Schiff they're so disingenous
[06:56] and they've done so much damage that it
[06:58] gets bitcoiners really fired up and uh
[07:01] they don't understand the history of
[07:03] gold you know if you look at well if you
[07:07] look at gold let's just take a moment
[07:08] here let's before we get going here with
[07:10] anything else let's just take a moment
[07:11] at Gold because we are going to flip
[07:13] gold I mean that is going to happen
[07:15] that's it's an18 trillion Doll Market
[07:17] you know when you start looking at the
[07:19] global uh markets you've got 300 uh uh
[07:23] real estate 300 or 330 probably in real
[07:26] estate 300 in uh bonds fixed in income
[07:30] you've got about 115 120 uh trillion in
[07:34] equities you got 18 in Gold 18 in art
[07:39] bunch of other little like uh
[07:41] collectible cars you know things of that
[07:44] nature maybe six trillion dollars and
[07:46] there's so much market cap out there
[07:48] that we haven't even touched yet and
[07:49] everybody talks about this so I won't
[07:51] stay focused on that but maybe in our
[07:54] discussion we can talk a little bit more
[07:56] about the history of gold and why
[07:58] Bitcoin is going to
[08:00] and it's kind of coupled with the SV
[08:01] discussion we'll we're going to flip
[08:04] gold and it's going to be part of like a
[08:08] reserve currency basket if you will it's
[08:12] it's also interesting was it sailor
[08:15] recently even on a on an interview where
[08:17] he um basically uh advertised for the
[08:21] Federal Reserve to to buy Bitcoin uh for
[08:24] for their balance I'm not sure I think I
[08:26] heard something along those lines um but
[08:29] yeah it's really interesting when you
[08:30] think about um Bitcoin as the new
[08:33] reserve for central banks and for uh for
[08:37] companies and for everything um it's
[08:39] it's kind of are we now officially uh in
[08:43] in the bull market is is the bull market
[08:45] now finally starting off with with with
[08:48] maybe the uh strategic Bitcoin Reserve
[08:51] with the 100K uh with all the things
[08:54] that going on well I you know I think uh
[08:58] I follow several people I follow several
[09:01] models uh I don't know if you're
[09:03] familiar with Cena's model with 21st
[09:06] Capital the quantile model I follow
[09:09] power law model uh and and there are a
[09:13] lot of detractors to that model but I I
[09:15] think it's just basically a lot of
[09:16] people don't understand the math that's
[09:19] behind the power law it's actually a
[09:21] good model uh you know just as an
[09:25] aside I'm probably going to screw up
[09:27] this guy's name his name's Darren asum
[09:30] moglu I'm sorry Darren I probably did
[09:32] screw up her name but anyway Darren and
[09:35] he gave a lecture at MIT in 2009 and he
[09:39] he he tied together why power laws work
[09:42] with networks and we're a network I mean
[09:44] you and me we're in a network here and
[09:47] uh he later went on to win the Nobel
[09:49] Prize I can't remember what it was for
[09:51] um but anyway there's good math behind
[09:54] that model and then the other thing is
[09:56] there's several other people I follow
[09:57] James cheze you know James names and uh
[10:02] checkmate at uh Twitter or X and I
[10:06] follow his information we do have some
[10:08] error below us right now this Market
[10:10] meaning if we had a significant
[10:12] correction uh down like into the 80s it
[10:16] wouldn't surprise me but that doesn't
[10:18] mean that has nothing to do with the
[10:20] bull market we are in the bull market
[10:23] I'd have to say we're approaching the
[10:24] Euphoria phase and that this is going to
[10:27] continue the next 12 months next 18
[10:29] months are going to be eye watering I
[10:30] think with what we
[10:32] see what what do we expect in uh for for
[10:35] 2025 we right at the start of 2025 so we
[10:38] have full 12 months in in front of us
[10:42] and all the things are just happened
[10:44] with the H with Trump the
[10:47] inauguration uh and and all the things
[10:49] that going on what do you expect for the
[10:51] next
[10:52] year I you know my original uh based
[10:55] upon a lot of the analysis that I do and
[10:58] onchain I really thought we'd see
[11:00] probably between like 225 to 285,000 on
[11:04] this next cycle and that it would follow
[11:06] the fouryear
[11:07] Cycles but when you when you really just
[11:10] step back for a minute and and zoom
[11:13] out I'd have to say that everything
[11:16] changed on Election Day I did not expect
[11:20] the election to go the way it did uh so
[11:24] dramatically uh you know president-elect
[11:26] Trump won seven out of the seven swing
[11:28] States
[11:30] popular vote that's unheard of and you
[11:33] know the fact that they carried the
[11:34] Senate and have a slim majority in the
[11:37] house I didn't expect that and I think a
[11:39] lot of bitcoiners I think that's what it
[11:41] is a lot of bitcoiners are still
[11:42] sleeping on this because and I know that
[11:45] trafi is I know that the people out
[11:48] there in the the real world that not
[11:49] like nuts like you and me they're
[11:51] sleeping I mean they really don't
[11:53] understand what's going on uh you know
[11:55] president Trump
[11:59] he's been very clear about about
[12:02] this and what I mean is even before he
[12:05] went to Nashville he had already told us
[12:08] uh he had already given us an indication
[12:10] of where this was going to go with
[12:11] Bitcoin I think the reason that he went
[12:13] to Nashville was because of both his
[12:16] sons and also his uh younger son Baron I
[12:20] think that they discussed this with him
[12:21] and the reason I say that is if you
[12:23] listen to Nick baa recently uh with
[12:25] Marty bent uh Nick gave reference to
[12:32] um I can't remember the new Chon chief
[12:35] economic adviser for president Trump and
[12:38] he's obviously very close to the family
[12:40] I mean he it will be their chief
[12:42] economic adviser and apparently Nick
[12:45] said that he discussed with uh Nick how
[12:49] president Trump is going to feel about
[12:51] Bitcoin he said it is part of the recipe
[12:55] for this country's
[12:57] success and additionally if you remember
[13:00] in June he made that comment and it
[13:03] sounded kind of silly at the time people
[13:05] almost pushed back against it because he
[13:07] said we're going to make all the Bitcoin
[13:10] and meaning we're going to be mining all
[13:11] the Bitcoin one you remember that do you
[13:13] remember that comment and of course a
[13:15] lot of people said well that's dumb you
[13:16] know you can't be doing that well I'm
[13:19] going to tell you right now if this SBR
[13:22] is signed in by executive order this
[13:25] country our country the United States of
[13:26] America is going to at some time be a
[13:28] sovereign nation that is mining Bitcoin
[13:31] we're going to start mining Bitcoin did
[13:34] you see uh I know I'm kind of zooming
[13:37] around here and getting off track a
[13:38] little bit but again it's because people
[13:41] just aren't bullish
[13:43] enough we are goingon to as a nation
[13:45] eventually we're going to have to have
[13:47] block space we it we we must have it and
[13:51] we at some point are going to be mining
[13:52] Bitcoin not because we need any more
[13:54] Bitcoin we're going to buy all the damn
[13:56] Bitcoin we want if that's what we want I
[13:58] expect
[13:59] I'm I'm 90% certain that within 48 Hours
[14:04] of him taking office we're going to
[14:06] see an executive order signed creating a
[14:11] strategic Bitcoin Reserve they'll
[14:12] probably take the 198,000 that we have
[14:15] left uh sees from bitfinex and the Silk
[14:19] Road and that's going to be the base
[14:22] whether Senator lumus Bill the Bitcoin
[14:25] act gets through Congress you know
[14:26] Congress just started today uh or
[14:29] yesterday they're they're in session now
[14:32] but she doesn't have a co-sponsor on
[14:34] that bill uh from the other side of the
[14:36] the party the Democrat so I'm not sure
[14:39] if that's going to pass but just
[14:41] president d uh Trump signing that bill
[14:45] is going to start the process and then
[14:47] you better just you better stand the
[14:48]  by because it's going to be eyew
[14:50] watering uh after
[14:52] that it's like last we we had in January
[14:57] the EDF approval
[14:59] and this year the big story is that we
[15:02] have Trump coming with a strategic
[15:05] Bitcoin Reserve which is I would argue
[15:08] an even bigger step towards the the the
[15:11] hyperbitcoinization
[15:13] um one interesting point that you also
[15:15] mentioned is and I recently talked about
[15:18] that on the podcast with Papa Bernette
[15:21] um uh which is the the controlling of
[15:24] the hash rate and how important that is
[15:27] absolutely that's an amazing topic it
[15:31] I'm telling you right now so what I was
[15:33] going to talk about also en coupling
[15:35] with this whole discussion because trust
[15:37] me we you don't know where this is going
[15:39] yet maybe you do but there very few
[15:41] people understand this so Bob berett he
[15:44] he started me down this Rabbit Hole uh
[15:47] just yesterday it came out that om Oman
[15:50] says the sultanate that they're going to
[15:52] start mining more Bitcoin they want to
[15:55] get 7% of the world's hash rate now what
[15:59] that means is they're going to be able
[16:01] to guarantee themselves about 10 blocks
[16:04] a day now just
[16:08] imagine just just think about this for a
[16:10] minute so let's just say that the United
[16:13] States sets up a strategic Bitcoin
[16:18] Reserve that is going to be the starting
[16:21] pistol for more and more Nations
[16:24] adopting Bitcoin whether it's on the sly
[16:26] which I think it's already occurred you
[16:28] know back in November uh that first
[16:31] weekend it was November 9th that
[16:32] Saturday and Sunday there was a very
[16:34] significant different type of buying
[16:36] that was going on in that
[16:38] period uh it was like an agnostic to
[16:42] price buyer so it means like somebody
[16:45] who had big pockets and really didn't
[16:47] give a what the price was and I say
[16:50] that because you know micro strategy
[16:52] when they go out and they
[16:54] purchase they're trying to not move the
[16:56] market they don't want that slippage as
[16:58] they buying all these these Bitcoin
[17:01] they're using something called Dark
[17:02] pools probably you know private fund
[17:04] private Ventures with significant
[17:07] capital capital in there they're using
[17:09] either time weighted purchases or vwap
[17:12] they're doing everything they can with
[17:14] Algos to try and not move that price but
[17:16] whoever was buying them really didn't
[17:17] didn't give a damn and when you have
[17:20] somebody buying agnostic to price it's
[17:22] either a nation state or it's somebody
[17:24] so wealthy they really just don't care
[17:26] they just want get me the Bitcoin
[17:30] and imagine let's just you know just
[17:32] picture where this is going let's look
[17:34] at the hash rate where it comes from
[17:36] right now the US has about 30% of the
[17:40] hash rate in the world right now and
[17:42] remember hash rate equals blocks and if
[17:45] you don't own a block let's say you want
[17:47] to do something with your Bitcoin you're
[17:50] never going to do it if you can't get it
[17:52] into that block ever so right now China
[17:57] because the top four out of the six uh
[18:01] mining pools are Chinese they have 40%
[18:05] of the uh hash
[18:07] rate and Russia uh Russia's got about
[18:11] 11% of hash rate right now that they're
[18:14] that there's coming from
[18:16] Russia you know uh Bhutan there there's
[18:19] a nation that's been mining Bitcoin and
[18:22] they're becoming more and more wealthy
[18:24] but they've only got about a third of a
[18:27] percent of the hash rate
[18:29] and they're going to increase it to the
[18:31] point where they might be able to get
[18:33] like half a block like one block every
[18:35] other day so there's going to be a race
[18:38] it's a war that's coming for this this
[18:40] block space and we're going to be right
[18:43] in the middle of it and and when
[18:45] President Trump said we we need to be
[18:47] mining all the Bitcoin a lot of people
[18:49] laughed but I didn't I thought you know
[18:51] I don't know if he I don't think he
[18:53] understands Bitcoin at that level but
[18:56] maybe he's just cunning or understands
[18:59] that we need to control those blocks
[19:01] because here's another you know here's
[19:03] another thing that he was heard saying I
[19:06] mentioned this not too long ago but I
[19:09] don't know if you ever saw that podcast
[19:10] it was a long time it was back in
[19:12] January last year and it was uh Peter
[19:15] McCormack and Danny was there and it had
[19:17] uh Preston pish and uh Luke Roman and
[19:22] they were on there and it and Peter
[19:25] McCormack and Dany brought up the fact
[19:28] that that President Trump had been while
[19:30] people were talking to him about Bitcoin
[19:32] he had been overheard on the phone
[19:34] saying Bitcoin is the new oil now I
[19:37] don't know just think about what I just
[19:39] said there again I don't know what his
[19:43] thought process is here but if he
[19:45] actually is thinking that knowing the
[19:48] history of the dollar and the Petro
[19:49] dollar you know from the mid 70s and I'm
[19:51] sure you're familiar with the Petro
[19:53] dollar well if he is somehow referencing
[19:56] that too that a deeper level also it's
[20:00] interesting it's like we know Eric Trump
[20:03] um has a good amount a good
[20:06] understanding of it um yeah it's well
[20:09] you you know what you just brought you
[20:11] just brought up exactly what I was
[20:12] thinking because I don't know you were
[20:15] at Mana you were there for the speech
[20:17] did you listen to Eric Trump's speech I
[20:19] listened uh actually only to his speech
[20:23] he gave in the VIP area uh and not on
[20:26] the main stage I just saw the clip where
[20:28] he said Bitcoin is going to a million
[20:31] and my thought is like if he says uh
[20:33] it's going to a million he probably
[20:35] thinks more about like 10 million but he
[20:37] cannot say 10 million because then
[20:39] people will call him crazy and he still
[20:41] has to to win elections and stuff like
[20:43] that but him saying the million that's
[20:45] that's that's huge well before we go any
[20:48] farther I'm so glad you brought up the
[20:49] word crazy because we need to tell
[20:52] people who I am um you know I first off
[20:56] anything I say today it's not Financial
[20:58] advice uh just consider me well I'll
[21:00] tell you who I am uh I I was kicked out
[21:04] of high school I and then I didn't go
[21:06] back so I'm a high school
[21:08] dropout I uh I went to college and I
[21:12] dropped out so I dropped out of college
[21:15] too and then I started working in the
[21:16] oil fields uh so I'm an ex oil field
[21:18] worker uh then I uh became an ex I'm an
[21:21] ex cop and I worked underground after
[21:24] that I drifted South into Colorado after
[21:26] a couple years and I started working
[21:27] underground as a minor not a Bitcoin hey
[21:30] I wanted to show you something you see
[21:32] that painting that's behind me that's
[21:34] got the the Dorian Nakamoto one right
[21:39] yeah the CEO of Bitcoin do you know that
[21:41] that painting is uh mining
[21:44] Bitcoin the the flashy lights that
[21:46] painting is actually mining Bitcoin so
[21:48] while we're broadcasting right now and
[21:51] when people view this I'm mining Bitcoin
[21:53] with my painting that I made and now if
[21:56] we win a block I want you to know
[21:58] something I'm probably going to cut our
[22:00] this is probably going to go short our
[22:01] interview I'm going to go over I got a
[22:03] thing of whiskey here I'm going to pour
[22:05] myself a big shot of whiskey and then
[22:07] you won't see me again so but anyway
[22:11] just as an aside
[22:13] U uh oh talk about Mana well so I
[22:16] listened to the entire speech and then I
[22:18] played a couple of the highlights there
[22:19] but I want to tell you
[22:21] something Eric Trump said something on
[22:24] stage that I I can't believe more people
[22:26] didn't like highlight or pick up on he
[22:30] said I've known Michael sailor for 20
[22:33] years interesting and I thought to
[22:36] myself I thought oh my God can you
[22:39] imagine okay just picture yourself
[22:41] you're like 25 or something just picture
[22:43] though like let's say you're an old fart
[22:45] like me imagine I'm 20 years ago and I
[22:48] meet Michael sailor and I I meet him
[22:50] once in a while and I'm I have his ear
[22:54] or I should say the Trump family has
[22:57] Michael sailor's ear because you saw
[23:00] what he just you saw what Eric Trump
[23:02] just put out two days ago the at malago
[23:06] yeah and what did he say that there was
[23:08] what was their joint passion yeah it was
[23:11] like uh two friends one passion with
[23:14] Bitcoin Bitcoin his passion is
[23:18] Bitcoin now imagine you know Michael
[23:21] Taylor for 20 years and what do you
[23:22] think about Baron uh if Nick batia if
[23:26] those comments are correct and they came
[23:28] from Stephen Miran I think is the uh
[23:31] gentleman's name he will be the chief
[23:33] economic adviser for president Trump so
[23:37] imagine that if these people had the ear
[23:40] of Michael sailor over I don't know this
[23:42] last period and you know let let me say
[23:44] another thing too why do you think
[23:46] Michael sailor is just hellbent on
[23:50] buying as much Bitcoin almost like a
[23:52] drunken sailor right now it's like um
[23:57] there there was this one tweet who put
[23:59] it out pretty hard or something like
[24:00] that um where like sailor probably knows
[24:04] something that that we all don't know
[24:07] and uh he he's B betting really big on
[24:11] it and he is invited to marago to Eric
[24:14] Trump and he he knows probably way more
[24:17] than we do yeah so and I didn't finish
[24:21] by the way for people out there that
[24:22] wonder what the hell I was talking about
[24:23] with background uh so I ended up working
[24:26] underground as a minor uh in the bottoms
[24:29] of the I mean I worked down between a
[24:30] mile and two miles down under the Earth
[24:33] and it sucked down there my life just
[24:35] was a mess then I went back to college I
[24:38] ended up uh uh getting into the Navy as
[24:40] a fighter pilot I flew f-18s hornets and
[24:43] the Navy which is the same plane that
[24:45] they used in Top Gun and then I did go
[24:46] through Top Gun and became a Top Gun
[24:49] adversary instructor which is why I can
[24:51] wear the hat and say hey I earned it I
[24:54] earned it the hard way so and then after
[24:57] that I flew for Delta
[24:59] uh was a captain with them flew
[25:00] International all over the world and uh
[25:04] uh unfortunately I had a traumatic brain
[25:06] injury uh at one point and that's
[25:09] another reason why you should not have
[25:10] pay attention to what I'm saying but and
[25:13] you know I shouldn't laugh about that
[25:16] because you know having gone through
[25:18] that and that was about 10 years ago and
[25:20] to see what it's like I have so much
[25:23] more empathy for all the troops and all
[25:25] the people that have experienced that in
[25:27] combat operations uh overseas I did not
[25:31] understand how devastating that was so
[25:33] but the bottom line is for anybody out
[25:35] there I don't have any background in
[25:37] finance these are just my thoughts I do
[25:39] a lot of research a lot of study I've uh
[25:42] you know I've screwed up a lot of stuff
[25:43] in life but Bitcoin I think Bitcoin and
[25:46] uh well bitcoin's my winning strategy it
[25:50] I mean I'm set with Bitcoin so it's
[25:53] really interesting and by the way I
[25:55] think in our first interview and I just
[25:57] want to show this uh quickly to people
[26:01] um we talked a little bit more about
[26:03] your uh background in the beginning so
[26:06] people can check that out this was also
[26:07] a really good uh interview and maybe a
[26:09] basis to uh what we are talking here if
[26:13] if people didn't see it and um this is
[26:16] the image that we were talking about uh
[26:19] with with sailor and and Eric Trump at
[26:22] maralago uh that that's that's huge yeah
[26:26] like I was like oh like is there some
[26:27] some connection there uh is is super
[26:30] interesting to to
[26:32] see and then you know keeping like
[26:35] continuing that conversation though
[26:37] about why I think people aren't bullish
[26:39] enough or excited enough you you know
[26:41] you don't have enough Bitcoin right now
[26:43] I mean you just don't unless you're me
[26:47] the only reason I can say I've got
[26:49] enough Bitcoin is because I'm broke I
[26:51] mean I I I'm broke I don't have any more
[26:54] money to put into Bitcoin I have enough
[26:56] Bitcoin you know
[26:58] just look at the people that they're
[27:00] going to draft into the administration
[27:02] you've got uh Scott bent you know if
[27:06] you've looked at his background he is uh
[27:09] both himself the Commerce Secretary and
[27:12] the News are the cryptos are none of
[27:14] them are academics they're not Janet
[27:15] Yellen you know he will be the Secretary
[27:18] of the Treasury these are people that
[27:20] have got boots on the ground that have
[27:21] done the hard work in the real world and
[27:23] they understand how it works and I have
[27:27] never I I looked up Scott bent's uh
[27:30] comments I can't find anything negative
[27:32] about Bitcoin not a single word and in
[27:35] fact I mean I just think he's a GNA be a
[27:38] breath of fresh air then let's talk
[27:40] about Paul Atkins same thing you know uh
[27:45] he's already got background in the in
[27:47] the SEC as a commissioner appointed
[27:49] during Bush sharp guy he's uh he's into
[27:54] less regulation he also is into and as
[27:57] mentioned that is in less regulation for
[28:00] electronic or digital assets and then
[28:03] look at the cryptar this guy that's
[28:05] coming in there
[28:07] uh what is his name David Sachs so look
[28:11] at him for just a minute you know he's
[28:13] gotten a lot of push back from the uh uh
[28:15] Bitcoin Community because uh he's got
[28:17] shitcoins in his background but you know
[28:19] what he's a sharp guy and I and again
[28:22] you look up his comments I can't find a
[28:24] single negative comment about Bitcoin in
[28:27] fact listen this this is a guy who once
[28:29] said Bitcoin can separate money from
[28:33] State he's bought Bitcoin in 2013 at 130
[28:38] bucks a coin I think that we're giving
[28:41] short shift to these guys uh some of
[28:43] these players that are coming into the
[28:45] space and and they've met you've seen
[28:47] the pictures of Senator lumus with bent
[28:49] and Paul Atkins in her office uh
[28:52] discussing
[28:53] thebr so again let's just go back to the
[28:56] premise here
[28:58] the s spr in my mind is going to happen
[29:01] and you've got to be prepared for that I
[29:03] don't know you know I don't know where
[29:05] things are going in the future I I have
[29:07] no crystal ball I follow all these
[29:10] models but you know that do you know a
[29:13] funny thing about Robin about models is
[29:16] that all models are trying to use
[29:19] historical Trends to somehow project a
[29:23] future that one model I mentioned the uh
[29:26] Power law if you take a regression
[29:29] analysis and and you're not drawing a
[29:31] line the math draws a line if you take
[29:34] regression analysis it's accurate within
[29:37] like 95 to 97% meaning at any point in
[29:41] there that price is falling within that
[29:44] deviation but but all of my the I've
[29:49] built my premises on the idea of a
[29:51] four-year cycle and I even in before the
[29:54] election I was thinking that a four-year
[29:56] cycle is going to continue
[29:58] I don't know how you feel about it but I
[30:00] feel like we're in Uncharted Territory
[30:03] like what we're going to see after
[30:05] January 20th means that Bitcoin could go
[30:08] anywhere you know Samson Mau is probably
[30:11] about the only person that's more
[30:13] bullish than I am and if he were in the
[30:15] studio if he were back there looking at
[30:17] the painting the CEO
[30:19] painting and talking to me and we were
[30:22] yaking and he said well you know
[30:23] bitcoin's going to a million of coin
[30:25] this this 25 I I I wouldn't laugh at him
[30:29] I wouldn't say you know you're an idiot
[30:31] I I would I'd just say you know what
[30:33] it's possible it is
[30:36] possible and I don't know what the plan
[30:39] like I don't know how hard they're going
[30:41] to push for this spr I know if they set
[30:45] aside the coins that they have and then
[30:48] make a commitment to purchase coins that
[30:50] it's going to cause a Tre tremendous
[30:54] response across the planet again I think
[30:57] that Sovereign nations are already
[30:59] stockpiling
[31:01] Bitcoin I I believe that we'll find out
[31:04] more about that within the next two to
[31:07] three months and we'll probably have
[31:09] names I think that countries are already
[31:12] understanding what you brought up you
[31:14] brought it up that the idea of blocks
[31:16] controlling block space hash rate it's
[31:19] so important and so all of these races
[31:22] are going to start that you know the
[31:23] gun's been fired we're on our way and
[31:27] nobody knows what's going to happen in
[31:28] this next cycle including myself I
[31:31] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[31:35] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[31:37] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[31:40] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[31:43] vigilante made a perfect Bitcoin watch
[31:46] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[31:49] go out there and show that you are a
[31:52] bitcoiner and that watch brand is

[32:11] which EPO we are currently in I love the
[32:15] level of detail they put in in this
[32:17] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[32:20] those amazing coin Vigilant the time
[32:22] pieces down in the descriptions I love
[32:25] those watches so so much if you watch or
[32:28] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[32:31] I'll guess you already bought some
[32:33] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[32:36] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[32:39] in a hardware wallet my personal
[32:41] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[32:43] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[32:45] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[32:48] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[32:51] exchange and you can get a 5% discount

[33:05] individual you have to have the most
[33:07] secure self- custody setup you have to
[33:10] secure your own devices you have to
[33:13] protect your privacy you have to set up
[33:16] an inheritance plan and depending on
[33:18] where you live you even want to have a
[33:21] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[33:24] in case something goes really really
[33:25] wrong and through all those steps the
[33:27] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step

[33:33] way.com
[33:34] Partners Robin you even get a 30 minute
[33:38] free call to find out how you can level
[33:40] up your sovereignty absolutely and this
[33:44] I also Imagine um this huge event
[33:49] happening maybe similar to do the do
[33:53] Bubble Run when just everything went up
[33:56] um and we might have a similar event in
[34:00] in Bitcoin and crypto where then
[34:03] afterwards Bitcoin kind of uh continues
[34:06] and some of the altcoins might die I
[34:09] don't know about that uh but I could
[34:11] imagine kind of like an Catalyst event
[34:13] for that and honestly last year ETF and
[34:17] now with the uh strategic Bitcoin
[34:20] Reserve if I had to bet on a year where
[34:23] this could happen 2025 maybe uh I don't
[34:26] know when it will happen but I'm almost
[34:29] certain that we will have some some
[34:32] Catalyst event where on all the price
[34:35] charts uh the developments till now look
[34:38] like a
[34:39] flatline and then this year 2025 I don't
[34:42] know maybe 2028 will just look like a a
[34:45] straight line up um I imagine like that
[34:47] with my limited life experiences with 26
[34:52] you know that's interesting that yeah
[34:53] because if you look at remember I
[34:56] mentioned the fact that
[34:58] uh that bitcoin's a network and if you
[35:01] look at networks how do we value it we
[35:03] use mef's law and metf law just says
[35:06] that the value of a network is
[35:08] proportional to the square of the users
[35:12] or the users squared so it's exponential
[35:15] and and think about that for a minute
[35:17] two people in the network with Bitcoin
[35:19] it's like a power of four if you will or
[35:21] or value of four but you just put a few
[35:23] more you get to 10 it's a 100 so it goes
[35:27] from four to 100 just by going from two
[35:29] to 10 people well we're in that that is
[35:32] what we're on we are a network you know
[35:35] Bitcoin is the single greatest invention
[35:38] in the history of mankind and it is
[35:41] expanding on this network curve it's
[35:44] like an scurve we talk about that a lot
[35:46] and in my estimation I think we're at
[35:48] about 5% exposure meaning not
[35:52] necessarily Bitcoin Fanatics like you
[35:54] and me or my fellow plebs out there that
[35:57] are listening to this or watching it but
[35:59] I'm talking about exposure to bitcoin so
[36:01] if we're at
[36:02] 5% usually as you go up that scurve when
[36:05] you get to about 14 to 16% it's called
[36:08] crossing the chasm and and when you get
[36:11] to that point you know lots of times the
[36:13] S curve dies bitcoin's not going to die
[36:16] I mean we're done with that discussion
[36:18] bitcoin's not going to fail that's not
[36:20] going to happen so we're going to
[36:23] continue and when we cross that Chasm
[36:26] again stand the FB because we are going
[36:29] to take off and you you are going to be
[36:31] left behind if you don't have Bitcoin
[36:33] with you and you you can create
[36:35] generational wealth you can change your
[36:38] family's trajectory completely by
[36:41] stacking as much Bitcoin as you can get
[36:43] now it's also interesting because you
[36:46] mentioned Network effects and networks
[36:48] are not only be between individuals but
[36:51] also between nations um what do you
[36:53] think will happen if America now
[36:55] actually goes ahead and does that in
[36:57] general
[36:58] um all the other countries are watching
[37:01] uh they seeing what America does they're
[37:03] already looking very closely all the
[37:05] secret Services of all the other
[37:07] countries um what do you imagine as EU
[37:10] countries China Russia uh du by the
[37:14] United Emirates uh doing well that's a
[37:16] deep question in a way because it almost
[37:18] takes
[37:20] you you know it almost takes you into
[37:22] the idea of you know what is money how
[37:25] do we settle international trade
[37:28] um you know right now if you look at
[37:30] let's just let's step back for a minute
[37:32] and approach it from a different way
[37:34] because this is a good idea to talk
[37:35] about you if you look at global trade
[37:38] right now the US dollar accounts for
[37:40] about 50% of it it's huge I mean it's
[37:44] huge if you look at uh China they're
[37:48] like four and a half percent of global
[37:50] trade and that's because the Awan nobody
[37:54] wants the Awan well no nobody wants the
[37:56] Awan let I mean it's not even a freely
[37:59] floating currency you know it's pay
[38:02] there's an offshore and an onshore if
[38:04] they ever let it out if they ever just
[38:06] let it float freely the oan it' collaps
[38:10] it'd be like a balloon with a hole in it
[38:11] just deflate all the populace without
[38:14] those Capital controls keeping them in
[38:17] they'd all Escape they'd want something
[38:19] else and the reason I bring this up is
[38:22] because look at look at the people that
[38:24] are trapped in Russia inside their
[38:26] currency right now do you think they
[38:28] really want to collect rubles or or
[38:30] anything else do do you think uh you
[38:33] know if you start looking at the bricks
[38:34] Nation put the bricks together for a
[38:36] minute and so let's just keep it to the
[38:39] four look at you know Brazil Russia
[38:42] India China so look at those
[38:45] four if you let's say that they wanted
[38:48] to escape the
[38:49] dollar and settle
[38:52] trade H how would they go about doing it
[38:55] well if you look at what uh Putin said
[38:58] in the middle of December he already
[39:01] told us as I mentioned a lot of hash
[39:03] rates coming out of
[39:05] Russia Putin said and and this was in
[39:08] that conference that he was speaking to
[39:10] all of these members he
[39:13] said who can and remember I'm
[39:15] translating from Russian he said who can
[39:18] prohibit Bitcoin meaning who can ban
[39:20] Bitcoin who can stop Bitcoin do you
[39:22] remember what he
[39:24] said
[39:25] nobody nobody
[39:28] who can stop Bitcoin nobody and then he
[39:31] went on the second comment was about
[39:33] electronic payment systems and who can
[39:35] stop those nobody and then even more
[39:39] importantly on the 25th on Christmas Day
[39:42] the Russian Finance Min Minister on
[39:44] National Television RT I believe it was
[39:47] said he confirmed that Russia is already
[39:50] settling global trade settlements using
[39:54] Bitcoin using Bitcoin I mean that's huge
[39:58] yeah it is and and just think for a
[40:00] minute what we're talking about we you
[40:01] know we're talking about first off
[40:03] Bitcoin is the greatest final
[40:06] settlement
[40:07] um transmission that you will ever be
[40:10] able to get and imagine it for nation
[40:12] states you know what is the problem with
[40:15] gold like for instance those countries I
[40:17] just mentioned especially Russia India
[40:19] China what are they doing they're
[40:21] stockpiling gold they're putting gold
[40:23] together as quick as they can and that's
[40:25] another counter to a convers ation that
[40:28] Nick Carter started in regards to why
[40:30] the US should not have a strategic
[40:33] Bitcoin Reserve that it would undermine
[40:35] the dollar when these countries
[40:38] accumulate gold are they doing so to
[40:40] undermine their currency they're not
[40:42] they're they're trying to strengthen
[40:44] their Curr currency Bitcoin is the same
[40:47] idea within a strategic Bitcoin Reserve
[40:50] it's the same idea so imagine imagine
[40:56] these countries are really searching for
[40:58] a way to escape the Petro dollar or the
[41:01] Swift sanctions and Russia you know
[41:04] Russia right now only accounts for 0.2%
[41:07] of global trade because they're
[41:08] sanctioned you know down tight
[41:11] so again if we just take it back to this
[41:14] first the first opening that we had here
[41:17] it's that people are not bullish
[41:19] enough imagine that we're on a a world
[41:22] stage where all these countries get it
[41:25] and we are up that s-curve and we get to
[41:27] Chasm maybe it happens sooner you know
[41:30] it's hard to for all the viewers out
[41:32] there if you're looking at me it's very
[41:35] difficult to understand exponential
[41:37] growth you think you get it but it's
[41:40] impossible hold on just a minute here so
[41:42] look here's a sheet of paper if I take
[41:45] this sheet of paper and I fold it over
[41:47] just one time one time like that and
[41:49] remember I'm sitting in my studio if
[41:51] you're watching I fold it over again
[41:53] that's two folds I do it again three
[41:55] folds now you can tell that as I go it's
[41:58] going to get harder and harder so but
[42:00] let's just say let's just say that I
[42:02] could fold that thing as much as I
[42:04] wanted in the studio sitting here right
[42:06] now do you know in 37 of those folds
[42:10] when I get to fold 37 I'm going to be
[42:13] from here where I'm sitting in this
[42:14] chair just look up for a minute I'm
[42:16] going to reach the moon 38,000 miles I'm
[42:19] going to go that little sheet of paper
[42:21] that you just saw is going to go to the
[42:23] Moon that's exponential growth you know
[42:25] Albert Einstein is quoted as being he
[42:28] said compound interest is the eighth
[42:31] wonder of the world I don't think he
[42:33] actually said that but he's attributed
[42:35] everybody says he says it so that's good
[42:37] enough for me but I I just don't think
[42:40] people understand how fast this can
[42:42] happen when you say things happen
[42:43] suddenly that sudden part it just takes
[42:46] people by surprise absolutely and
[42:48] especially if if now most most of them
[42:50] are are sleeping it's it's f i I was
[42:53] actually kind of blown away because
[42:56] Christmas is the time where you see a
[42:59] lot of the family that you don't see for
[43:01] a longer period of time because the
[43:03] bigger family comes together and it's
[43:05] like 50 people 60 people uh or 40 people
[43:07] something like that and you see a lot of
[43:09] people that you rarely see in the year
[43:12] and I was like wow like Bitcoin is not a
[43:16] topic but they they don't care like
[43:18] they're completely asleep they they they
[43:20] still think it's bad for the environment
[43:22] they still think it's like some small
[43:24] asset that's a little specul to to
[43:27] gamble on the internet like all the
[43:29] things that they have been said for
[43:31] years it's still in their minds it's
[43:33] only the people that are close to me
[43:35] like mom dad sister uh some cousins that
[43:38] are interacting with me more that they
[43:40] get it and they are all in Bitcoin but
[43:43] the further out they are they have no
[43:45] idea and it's it's fascinating for me to
[43:47] see that normal land do you know one of
[43:50] the things that's going to change in the
[43:52] next year and this is just this is going
[43:54] to be a massive is we are going to
[43:57] repeal th those people that I mentioned
[43:59] earlier that are coming into the Trump
[44:02] Administration uh Saab 121 is an SEC
[44:05] bulletin or a rule I should say you know
[44:08] it all it has to do is like that be
[44:10] rescinded and it's going to and when it
[44:13] does what that is that Saab 121 it
[44:15] doesn't prohibit Banks from having
[44:18] Bitcoin on their balance sheet but it
[44:20] makes it so prohibitively expensive that
[44:24] they won't do it when that's repealed
[44:27] we are going to see so many banks flood
[44:31] this space do you remember uh I don't
[44:33] know if you ever saw this on bitcoin
[44:35] talk Forum back in
[44:38] 2010 how fenny talked about this he
[44:41] actually talked about uh using
[44:44] Bitcoin as a reserve asset on Banks and
[44:48] that Banks would be using you know
[44:49] tokenized assets with Bitcoin as the
[44:52] base layer and that it would solve our
[44:54] scalability problem be one of the
[44:56] methods
[44:58] and it's coming and when and when it
[45:00] comes those Banks they're going to want
[45:02] to buy sell trade and they're going to
[45:05] custody Bitcoin custody it and and it's
[45:09] not going to stop you know Black Rock I
[45:11] think I even mentioned this maybe to you
[45:12] last time Larry thinkink he wants a bank
[45:14] Sol 121 prohibited he gets an exemption
[45:18] over the weekend and then New York bank
[45:21] is his uh his bank they're all going to
[45:24] want this and we we are going to see so
[45:28] many new products coming out that are
[45:31] going to let you keep your
[45:34] Bitcoin for Life you'll never have to
[45:38] sell your
[45:39] Bitcoin you you know Robin as young as
[45:42] you are right now you are going to
[45:44] create a dynasty around you you you may
[45:48] not know it now but I'm telling you in
[45:51] 20 years you're going to look back and
[45:52] you are going to have the robins Dynasty
[45:57] uh and it's all going to be your family
[45:58] members and people that are close to you
[46:01] it may be on a fedt you know you may
[46:03] have your own little island fedt would
[46:05] work perfect for that and you will be a
[46:09] guardian yourself maybe your wife you're
[46:12] going to have kids they're going to have
[46:13] grandkids and if you know what you're
[46:15] doing when those Banks get in the space
[46:18] sailor's already told us this he he's
[46:20] talked about this several times you're
[46:22] never going to sell your Bitcoin and I
[46:26] know I know some Maxis I can see Jeff
[46:29] Booth right now looking at me and going
[46:32] oh that loser you know have you ever
[46:35] seen you know that you're familiar with
[46:37] the Terracotta soldiers that they dig up
[46:39] in that they dug up in China you know
[46:41] the army of soldiers that were buried
[46:43] beneath the Earth and and they take them
[46:46] around to museums and they stand there
[46:49] proud and tall and and it's amazing site
[46:51] to see them thousands of them thousands
[46:53] of these clay statues buried in the
[46:55] Earth
[46:57] but what a a lot of people don't know is
[47:00] every few thousand there's one General
[47:04] and he has a different outfit on a
[47:06] different uh face a different demeanor
[47:09] he has a finger in a different position
[47:11] he is a general he's a thinker he's
[47:13] planner that's Jeff Booth he's a planner
[47:16] you know I'm just a grunt you know I'm
[47:18] out there with my armor on you know I'm
[47:22] just a warrior and and I'm telling you
[47:24] right now I spend big coin I have no
[47:27] issue with that I use Aqua wallet I love
[47:30] it I don't mind throwing it around I bet
[47:32] you just did recently in El Salvador you
[47:34] probably spent some right absolutely
[47:37] yeah so I was even at a conference the
[47:40] an conference where you can only buy
[47:42] your ticket with Bitcoin same I've done
[47:45] the same thing and and I don't mind
[47:47] doing that I love it so I just get a you
[47:49] know a spend a a fill and spend wallet
[47:51] like Aqua I put some stats in there I
[47:54] spend it and then for me because I'm in
[47:55] the US I have to worry about capital
[47:57] gains but if I just fill and spend it
[47:59] there is none I don't have to worry
[48:00] about any of that so it's it's fun and I
[48:03] like supporting Bitcoin in that economy
[48:05] but my Bitcoin that I have me in a
[48:09] wallet that's precious and you know what
[48:12] you know look at my fist it's gonna
[48:15] you're GNA have to pry that Bitcoin out
[48:18] of that Fist and I'm going to tell you
[48:20] something you're looking at somebody
[48:21] who's gone up and down and up and down
[48:23] on the volatility train with Bitcoin and
[48:26] I am a Harden son of a you are too
[48:29] I don't volatility doesn't scare me at
[48:31] all I'm unfazed by it so you're not
[48:35] going to pry that Bitcoin loose these
[48:37] people that are the Trad five people
[48:40] that are coming in our space they have
[48:42] no idea what's coming because there are
[48:44] a lot of people like you and me and uh
[48:46] here's another thing God I'm all over
[48:48] the place today I guess I'm just so
[48:49] excited about this upcoming year but
[48:52] here's another
[48:54] thing when I flew in the Navy my call
[48:57] was Jethro and the reason is my last
[48:59] name is Bodin so that character is an
[49:01] old TV character in a stupid sitcom
[49:04] called Beverly Hillbillies and Jethro
[49:07] Bodin was kind of an idiot and he had to
[49:09] take off his shoes and count on his
[49:12] fingers so my call sign was Jethro so
[49:15] let's play a game and pretend I'm Jethro
[49:17] and let's go over some
[49:18] things let's count how many Bitcoin are
[49:21] off the market right now if this
[49:24] strategic Bitcoin Reserve goes into a
[49:26] effect into full effect it's going to be
[49:29] 1 million Bitcoin 500 a day purchased
[49:33] for 5 years Toshi's 1.1 million coins
[49:38] gone right now the last uh I just read
[49:42] that Bernstein a private uh firm put out
[49:46] an investor newsletter they forecasted
[49:49] Michael sailor and I believe it now
[49:50] Michael sailor is going to get a million
[49:52] coins million coins they're going to be
[49:53] gone the ETFs right now they just went
[49:56] over a million if you take now we were
[49:59] talking about countries if you take the
[50:01] top 71 countries and companies all of
[50:04] them combined that's three million
[50:07] Bitcoin
[50:08] gone now if you take the Bitcoin that
[50:11] are lost we're going up I ran out of
[50:14] fingers because now we're at 11 fingers
[50:18] that's 11 million coins where are all
[50:20] the coins going to come from that is
[50:24] going to fuel this new world and I'm not
[50:27] talking about that you'll never see
[50:29] Bitcoin sold like on exch you know how
[50:31] people sometimes talk and they'll say
[50:34] uh uh there's going to be a supply shock
[50:37] there won't be enough Bitcoin there's
[50:38] always going to be Bitcoin for sale you
[50:41] know if you look at SS law the uh Supply
[50:45] creates its own demand and you can
[50:46] reverse it demand creates
[50:49] Supply that means that for every for
[50:54] every seller there is a buyer all
[50:58] they're negotiating is price and when
[51:01] Bitcoin hits 400,000 a coin there's
[51:03] going to be
[51:04] sellers uh when it's a million a coin
[51:07] there's going to be sellers there it's
[51:08] going to happen I'm not talking about
[51:10] that what I'm talking about is the price
[51:13] that fist the price that it's going to
[51:15] take to pull that Bitcoin out of my hand
[51:18] it's going to be a lot when you think
[51:20] about the when you think along those
[51:23] lines for instance and I know I've been
[51:26] going I'll take a break in just a minute
[51:27] so look at just the last thing I'm going
[51:29] to say is look at long-term holders
[51:32] glass node classifies them as people
[51:34] that have held their coins for 155 days
[51:37] or longer and the reason they do that is
[51:39] when people get to 155 days for some
[51:42] reason they mentally switch they kind of
[51:45] like just they flip a switch they are
[51:47] more likely to hoddle but guess what as
[51:51] we went up to 73k and then 100K
[51:54] long-term holders sold one million coins
[51:59] into the
[52:00] market they were selling as recently as
[52:03] maybe last week a 30,000 coins a day so
[52:06] they are selling but these people that
[52:08] are selling are they're not the Deep
[52:11] long-term holders they're they're like
[52:13] 60k people 55k
[52:16] 65k and I'm going to tell you something
[52:19] these people are are they're going to
[52:21] regret selling that Bitcoin this next
[52:24] year people are going to look back and
[52:26] they're going to there going to be a lot
[52:27] of salty crocodile tear out there from
[52:30] people that sold into this Market okay
[52:32] I'll take a
[52:34] break there were a lot of things in
[52:36] there um I know I'm sorry bu but it's
[52:39] really good it's usually the the the the
[52:43] moments in the in the podcast that I
[52:45] like the most at least when I listen to
[52:47] a podcast where the guest just goes on
[52:48] on tangum uh it's really fun to to see
[52:52] um one thing on that note uh the the
[52:55] future role of scaling B Bitcoin and the
[52:56] future role of institutions in Bitcoin
[52:58] is really interesting for me I had this
[53:00] discussion with a um with a friend of
[53:03] mine recently where we talk okay when
[53:06] micro strategy has all those Bitcoin
[53:08] like if if they even if they just have
[53:10] like 200 300,000 that's already a lot if
[53:13] they go up to a million that that's
[53:14] massive they can be almost the Central
[53:17] Bank like that point if if Bitcoin is as
[53:20] big as it will become and they have as
[53:22] many Bitcoin as they have they will be
[53:25] uh a central bank
[53:27] and then when you spin that for further
[53:30] if you have let's say a th000 Bitcoin or
[53:32] 100 Bitcoin you will be like a smaller
[53:35] Regional Bank or like even like a bigger
[53:37] uh bank and even if you have like 10
[53:39] Bitcoin you maybe a smaller Regional
[53:42] Bank that like in a town and stuff like
[53:44] that how do you see that because we also
[53:47] know block space is limited so we know
[53:49] not everyone will have that uh luxury
[53:52] access to the uh main layer I think Bob
[53:56] beret calls it we used to roll around in
[53:59] a Rolex when we transact on the main
[54:02] layer and we kind of have to get used to
[54:04] all the second layers yes he said he
[54:07] says you and I we're spoiled Robin
[54:09] because we like we like to ride around
[54:11] in a rollsroyce and he's right I do but
[54:15] you know what we're not going to get to
[54:17] uh be on the base layer uh much longer
[54:19] as as far as uh common interactions it's
[54:22] just not going to happen so anyway
[54:24] listen I I love what you brought up
[54:26] there you got it exactly
[54:28] right you know this is over a year ago
[54:31] that I finally figured out in my mind
[54:34] where uh micro strategy was going and it
[54:39] just came like I I was studying studying
[54:41] studying and I just suddenly I was
[54:43] convicted I thought oh my God he is
[54:46] going to become the world's large
[54:49] largest Bitcoin bank and uh I was
[54:52] talking to Larry leard I remember
[54:53] talking to him about it and uh oh by the
[54:55] way you know I uh I got to read Larry's
[54:58] book he he allowed me to do a a galley
[55:01] proof of it you know to read it it's a
[55:03] page Turner I mean it's it's really a
[55:05] good book I I told him I said this is
[55:08] awesome so it'll be out soon probably no
[55:11] later than February so anyway getting
[55:12] back to micro
[55:14] strategy so you know why why is that why
[55:17] is that important well
[55:20] because and I I mentioned this I don't
[55:23] think I mentioned it to you before but
[55:26] Michael sailor has already told us where
[55:28] where this is going and you know he's
[55:31] taking this company to a place where
[55:34] nobody where no one's gone before it's
[55:37] like he's got us all on the boat
[55:40] especially Harden investors like myself
[55:42] and full disclosure to anybody that's
[55:43] listening I've got a lot of micr
[55:45] strategy stock so I I'm biased I'm
[55:48] probably up here but but I really
[55:51] am a firm believer in this stock in fact
[55:53] I would have to say that I probably will
[55:55] never sell that micro strategy
[55:58] again you and I you can create a dynasty
[56:03] going forward in the next 20 years if
[56:05] you know how to do this right and we can
[56:06] get back to that but it you know if you
[56:09] I call it the uh buy borrow die Dynasty
[56:15] plan and you can do this you will Robin
[56:19] I I'll tell you I guarantee you're going
[56:20] to do it so but uh looking at micro
[56:24] strategy I thought you know he talked he
[56:26] had that conversation where he was
[56:27] budding heads with
[56:29] safe uh amose and I at the time I kind
[56:32] of wondered why he was bringing up this
[56:34] idea of a bank and if you remember the
[56:37] discussion he was talking about Central
[56:38] kind of a a bank that's large enough in
[56:41] a large enough country with a central
[56:43] bank behind it a bank that was too big
[56:46] to fail you would someday be able and he
[56:50] said 10 years you'd be able to take your
[56:52] money and or your Bitcoin and actually
[56:55] lend it out to the bank and you and I
[56:57] both I'll bet you won't argue when I say
[56:59] that Bitcoin is the most pristine cap uh
[57:02] capital or collateral in the world so if
[57:05] you believe that you know that every
[57:08] bank is going to want that and Michael
[57:10] sailor is already GNA have it and then
[57:13] in that recent con uh conversation I had
[57:16] with Alex Thorne uh this was last month
[57:20] they were in that White Hall in uh
[57:23] sailor's house they were discussing this
[57:25] he brought up the same and in the first
[57:27] conversation he talked about Goldman
[57:28] Sachs and JP Morgan he did the same
[57:31] thing and the same kind of a
[57:33] conversation and if you listen to his
[57:35] earnings call and and today is the first
[57:39] day after they came out with an
[57:41] announcement about uh Perpetual
[57:43] preferred stock I'm not going to discuss
[57:46] that today it's too deep uh and I
[57:48] probably would sound like a village
[57:49] idiot myself trying to get a handle on
[57:51] it but I I'm already doing research on
[57:54] that because I think that's part of
[57:55] their plan too
[57:58] so where I'm going with this
[57:59] conversation is
[58:02] that this is going to sound silly
[58:06] but JP Morgan with $3.5 trillion under
[58:11] management is going to start custody
[58:14] trading buying selling Bitcoin micro
[58:19] strategy is someday going to be the
[58:22] world's largest Bitcoin Bank all these
[58:25] banks are going to to want to be in this
[58:27] space and what does that mean means that
[58:30] every one of these companies just like a
[58:32] Sovereign Nation are going to start
[58:34] mining Bitcoin micro strategy is going
[58:38] to have to mine Bitcoin if they want to
[58:40] do what they want to do and the reason
[58:43] is again if you don't mine the block and
[58:47] control the men poool template you're
[58:50] never going to get your transaction in
[58:52] unless somebody accepts it and I
[58:55] mentioned this recently just picture
[58:57] president Trump 4:00 in the afternoon we
[59:00] have a strategic Bitcoin Reserve Senator
[59:02] lumus has already told us she says we're
[59:05] going to have these geographically
[59:06] dispersed around the country and and
[59:09] president Trump says we're moving you
[59:11] know 5,000 Bitcoin to such and such in
[59:15] in South Dakota tonight make it happen
[59:17] he calls down to somebody or tells an
[59:19] aid and the aid says well Mr President
[59:22] we're going to have to put it into the
[59:24] mempool template and hope that somebody
[59:27] picks up your transaction and we'll put
[59:29] a really high fee on it president
[59:31] Trump's going to throw ketchup on the
[59:33] wall which is kind of an old joke and
[59:35] you if you look it up you'll see why he
[59:37] he's going to throw ketchup on the wall
[59:39] and then he's going to fire whoever just
[59:40] told him that and he's going to make
[59:41] sure that he controls a block the next
[59:44] day and this is going to happen all over
[59:46] in our space and the reason I'm bringing
[59:49] up this convoluted subject is because of
[59:51] that painting right behind me do you see
[59:53] that painting with that little tiny
[59:55] Miner this
[59:56] year in last year we started a
[60:00] revolution that I want to see continue
[60:03] in the next year and that Revolution is
[60:06] people like me taking a little miner
[60:08] like that and plugging it into your wall
[60:12] socket we have miners coming out this
[60:15] month that can put out
[60:19] 2.5 Terra hatch in just like with very
[60:23] little power consumption that one back
[60:25] there
[60:26] puts out I think
[60:29] 1.5 it uses about 80 cents of
[60:31] electricity a month and right now I have
[60:36] it solo mining but I'm going to point it
[60:39] to Ocean ocean Mining and why am I going
[60:43] to do that because if we don't want
[60:46] these PE these big institutions big
[60:50] Banks Big Brothers to come into our
[60:53] space and crowd us out so that we no
[60:56] longer have the ability to transact
[60:58] we've got to start minding ourselves all
[61:00] of us and if enough plebs we're going to
[61:03] have all this new found wealth next year
[61:06] so if you have new found wealth just buy
[61:08] a damn Miner plug it into a wall socket
[61:12] we never used to be able to do that
[61:13] doesn't make any noise that one plug it
[61:16] into a wall socket and start hashing
[61:19] start sending your hash somewhere with a
[61:22] company that is morally and ethic Ally
[61:27] align with your values as a bitcoiner
[61:29] because you know what the values of the
[61:31] US government may not align with you uh
[61:35] JP Morgan you know I guarantee you those
[61:38] Pricks are not going to align with my
[61:39] morals or or
[61:41] standards I we need to have you know I
[61:45] think even Bob might have mentioned this
[61:46] I can't remember but we need to have 25
[61:48] to 30% of the hash rate all of us plebs
[61:51] we got to own that and we got to send it
[61:53] to places the reason I'm sending it to
[61:56] is because I like their template that
[61:59] you you can just plug into it's no none
[62:02] of this ofac you know I don't want
[62:04] to be denied my transactions because
[62:06] somehow my Bitcoin got intermixed with
[62:10] somebody that's on a ofac list uh and is
[62:14] denied or banned and that could happen
[62:18] all it's another rant I got going here I
[62:20] better stop anyway what question you
[62:23] have no keep going I I like it um but
[62:28] yeah I I was just uh noting down um I
[62:32] love the comparison that Bob berett is
[62:35] doing with the rabbits and the horses
[62:37] and I think the elephants are the big
[62:39] ones and I I think so to that we need a
[62:43] lot more rabbits and small horses to to
[62:46] get mining especially the the rabbits as
[62:50] you such an amazing analog with like you
[62:53] can shoot maybe one uh but you never can
[62:56] shoot everyone because they're just
[62:59] running around and it's just like one
[63:00] mile you can get get so you you move it
[63:03] really fast and even the small horses
[63:05] like if you have a small operation you
[63:07] can move everything in like a day or
[63:09] something like that uh we'll we'll all
[63:11] be little rabbits like we'll all have
[63:14] these little miners plugged in all over
[63:15] the damn place and then guess what we're
[63:17] safe you know what we'll we'll be
[63:19] breeding like rabbits and we'll be all
[63:21] over the damn place and they're not
[63:23] going to shut us down and and so we've
[63:25] got to control that that's one of the
[63:27] threats that we we've got to address as
[63:29] a community and and this new wave it's
[63:32] coming I'm telling you right now that
[63:33] one that puts out
[63:35] 2.5 uh terahash I mean that's quite a
[63:38] unit it's quiet it doesn't use much
[63:41] electricity and there's more and more
[63:42] it's just building faster and faster as
[63:44] we're sitting here right now and I think
[63:46] block even comes out with a new minor
[63:49] soon I heard about something I don't
[63:51] maybe it's already out but I I have not
[63:53] heard about it uh so I think it's just
[63:56] starting to like user friendly great
[64:01] devices that you can just plug and play
[64:03] and maybe configure a little bit with a
[64:05] nice interface those will be out and
[64:08] maybe even integrated with heating
[64:09] systems where you can use the Heat and
[64:11] stuff like that uh I know 21 energy
[64:14] there's an aan company that does that uh
[64:16] where you can heat your home and mine
[64:18] Bitcoin with that and configure that
[64:20] stuff uh those use cases will be massive
[64:24] or if you have a house at at home maybe
[64:26] with a pool or something like that uh
[64:28] you can heat the pool with with a mining
[64:30] operation and maybe you have a garage
[64:31] where you can set it up so the noise is
[64:33] not coming to the living uh um place so
[64:37] that I think a mining is such an
[64:39] underrated topic I think it's just like
[64:41] a topic where everyone was like yeah
[64:43] it's running I don't care about it but
[64:45] it's really exciting the um deeper you
[64:48] look you know let's let's uh before we
[64:51] get I before I start getting off topic
[64:53] again let's talk for a minute about what
[64:54] I said earlier about uh because this is
[64:56] a very hopeful uh discussion and it's
[64:59] about the idea of creating generational
[65:02] wealth you know think about the families
[65:05] that you're aware of that have spanned
[65:07] generations and even centuries you know
[65:10] let's let's think about it for a minute
[65:12] let's go with the rosch Childs you know
[65:14] their Bank was founded in the 1700s and
[65:16] they are still today one of the
[65:18] wealthiest families on the
[65:20] planet The Rockefellers look at the
[65:23] arnal you'd be familiar with those Louis
[65:25] Vuitton and Hennessy Moet look at the
[65:29] Mars family the Koch brothers the uh
[65:33] Vanderbilts although they didn't do a
[65:35] good job in one part which is education
[65:38] these families have a something that
[65:40] unites them even the royal family and
[65:43] what it is is that strategy I talked
[65:45] about and that's not something I
[65:47] developed I mean every many people know
[65:49] about this you know buy borrow die and
[65:54] uh in my case I put on on Dynasty at the
[65:56] end because the the reason these
[65:58] generational wealth plans work is
[66:01] because people like yourself in 20 years
[66:03] you're going to have kids they're you
[66:05] know you'll be approaching grandkids
[66:07] pretty soon you're going to have a
[66:09] tremendous amount of wealth so you are
[66:11] going to have a responsibility as a
[66:13] guardian to pass on the information that
[66:16] they need to have in order to keep not
[66:19] just their Bitcoin but also to do
[66:22] something with the Bitcoin in other
[66:24] words most of these families have given
[66:27] back tremendous amounts uh in
[66:30] philanthropy in charitable trust and in
[66:33] fact trust planning is one of the
[66:35] reasons that they keep their wealth but
[66:38] for instance let's just look at the US
[66:39] for a
[66:41] minute if you create tremendous amount
[66:44] of wealth in your Bitcoin wallet and you
[66:48] die you know how normally you pay
[66:51] capital gains every time that you sell
[66:53] Bitcoin or you have to pay taxes on it
[66:56] if you die with that
[66:58] Bitcoin our tax system and this won't
[67:00] apply to you but something else will in
[67:02] just a minute our tax system will take
[67:04] that Bitcoin you have and it'll
[67:05] immediately like that Mark it right back
[67:08] up to fair value wherever Bitcoin is
[67:10] trading your airs will receive it and
[67:13] they'll have no tax due on it but more
[67:17] importantly you don't want to spend the
[67:19] Bitcoin what you really want to do and
[67:21] it's going to happen with these Banks is
[67:23] you're going to want to borrow against
[67:24] that Bitcoin
[67:26] as your wealth goes up and up and up
[67:28] you're going to start getting to a point
[67:30] where you're willing to take loans out
[67:33] on that Bitcoin and usually they're
[67:34] small they're like 5% or less they can
[67:36] be higher as it goes up depending upon
[67:39] the cycle too but what I'm talking about
[67:43] is you're going to take these loans out
[67:45] and they'll be shortterm and the next
[67:47] year you'll probably take off another
[67:48] loan you'll pay off the previous one
[67:51] you're that loan is not taxed it's just
[67:55] income it's it's not even tax and even
[67:58] in Austria that applies there they won't
[68:00] tax that and you'll never pay taxes on
[68:04] it and as you die in your country you'll
[68:07] have two things you'll have inheritance
[68:09] tax and I think it's a wealth transfer
[68:11] tax I think but they're very they're
[68:13] small they're not big and the other
[68:15] thing is if you use a financial advisor
[68:18] you can use a trust and charitable trust
[68:21] and you'll never pay any taxes on it
[68:23] your wealth will stay intact as years go
[68:26] by it just will get bigger and bigger
[68:28] and I mean I can prove this to you I and
[68:31] the reason I say that this works is
[68:34] because of Bitcoin it's all these
[68:37] families for
[68:39] centuries what unites them is they all
[68:41] try to get the most the best assets they
[68:45] can have that will appreciate over time
[68:48] beyond the cost of capital which is
[68:51] about in the US 10.8% over decades so so
[68:55] beyond that so that their wealth
[68:57] increases but you and I know what is the
[69:01] what is the greatest performing
[69:04] asset over the last 15
[69:07] years it's Bitcoin you can't beat it if
[69:11] I gave you uh uh if I gave you a100
[69:14] million right now and you were at sailor
[69:16] Mansion re recently and you said and I
[69:19] told you I said well what are you going
[69:20] to buy you said I'm going to buy
[69:21] sailor's Mansion then I would say to you
[69:25] what is the next best opport what
[69:27] opportunity cost are you incurring
[69:29] what's the next best alternate asset
[69:31] that you just passed up and you'd think
[69:33] about it and you'd say it's Bitcoin it's
[69:37] always going to be Bitcoin so if you use
[69:39] Bitcoin as this base to your wealth it's
[69:43] going to go up and up every year you
[69:45] know I got a lot of online the
[69:46] other day because I was trying to
[69:47] explain to people how compound growth
[69:51] works and I used $110,000 it was like a
[69:54] tenth of a Bitcoin
[69:55] do you know $110,000 right now Bitcoin
[69:58] over the last five years has returned
[70:00] 55% so that
[70:03] $10,000 it going forward if you took it
[70:06] Forward 20 years and that's not long in
[70:08] your life 20 years it's $64 million now
[70:11] a lot of people said well that's too
[70:12] high and they might be right maybe I'm
[70:15] wrong about the last cycle being cut off
[70:17] early maybe we're not going to have a
[70:18] big you know Supernatural cycle this
[70:21] next time and uh let's say it goes down
[70:24] to 40%
[70:26] that's
[70:27] still I think it's like $14 million it's
[70:30] a lot of money and it's just going to
[70:33] keep going up and up your kids if they
[70:36] understand how this works they're going
[70:39] to be even wealthier and your family you
[70:43] you can give you can give a gift to all
[70:46] the people you love that will go on
[70:48] forever with Bitcoin and so I'm just
[70:52] mentioning that because I hope people
[70:54] understand that in the future when these
[70:55] Banks come around there's going to be a
[70:57] lot of push back
[70:59] but eventually we're going to want these
[71:02] we're going to want all this Capital to
[71:04] flow into Bitcoin if we want to see
[71:06] Bitcoin hyperbitcoinization we have to
[71:09] have it if we want a 100 if we want
[71:11] Bitcoin to hundred trillion dollars
[71:13] everything that I'm talking about
[71:14] options trading ETFs Banks
[71:18] governments all of these things have to
[71:21] come into our space for the
[71:23] liquidity I better take a break
[71:26] sorry bu I love that I love that um it's
[71:30] it's also interesting when you when we
[71:32] look at that annual compound when we
[71:35] compound annual growth rates uh and
[71:38] calculate that my mind is always like
[71:41] especially if you take it 10 20 30 years
[71:43] all those models at some point they will
[71:45] break to the upside like at some point
[71:48] either they make a new currency or the
[71:50] US dollars I mean it would be also
[71:51] interesting to see how it develops if
[71:54] they start now backing the US dollar
[71:57] with Bitcoin early enough uh that might
[72:00] preserve the value of the US dollar uh
[72:04] and prolonging his life uh but if he
[72:07] don't do it those models will just break
[72:10] to the upside you know it's funny yeah
[72:12] yeah that you should bring that up
[72:14] because I I realized thinking about it I
[72:16] think when I said 40% that actually
[72:18] comes out to like 43 million if you use
[72:21] Michael sailor's model and goes down to
[72:24] like 29% over that 20 years but he's got
[72:28] it down at 20% for several years just
[72:30] Flatline and I'm not sure that's correct
[72:33] and and but let's just say you use his
[72:35] model then it's like 13 14 million and
[72:37] and I think he even puts that out but
[72:40] yeah you're right you can't understand
[72:41] that and and even with the power law
[72:44] model Giovani santostasi the the founder
[72:47] of that model he acknowledges the fact
[72:49] that at some point the model will die it
[72:51] has to and when it does I I mean I don't
[72:54] know where we're going then clueless I I
[72:57] look at the I had that with
[73:02] stepen uh I I forgot his last name but
[73:06] it it's uh my second most famous video
[73:10] actually on on on the channel um uh and
[73:14] we talked about the power law and all
[73:16] those things around the power law and
[73:19] one thing he brought up was the power
[73:21] law of Bitcoin not in US dollar but in
[73:24] gold and I like that way more because uh
[73:28] when you have that um you get you you
[73:32] you get away with the US dollar just
[73:34] breaking away because all people attack
[73:36] the power LW because of the US dollar
[73:38] thing because at some point yeah it will
[73:41] break the US do like most bitcoiners
[73:43] believe that the US dollar will either
[73:46] completely go away or it will
[73:47] hyperinflate or they make something new
[73:49] out of it or like something happens with
[73:50] that and it breaks to the upside but
[73:53] gold will probably always have some
[73:55] sense of value even though it will be
[73:57] demonetized by Bitcoin uh but it will
[74:01] not completely vanish away so you can
[74:03] better track the adoption rate of
[74:05] Bitcoin with the power law and not the
[74:08] inflation rate on top of that if you
[74:11] understand what I mean yeah that's
[74:12] interesting I haven't seen that but I'd
[74:14] love to take a look at that model I I'm
[74:16] glad you brought up gold because you
[74:18] know again getting back to uh some of
[74:21] the push back against the spr including
[74:23] Bitcoin which I I strongly support this
[74:26] idea but you know when you look at gold
[74:29] and its history it really is the world's
[74:32] first Reserve Global well not Global
[74:35] let's say the world's first Reserve
[74:36] currency for like Florence with the
[74:39] Floren and then Venice with the Ducati
[74:43] or the
[74:44] ducat and ducot and that was about a
[74:47] dimiz gold coin that weighed 3.5 grams
[74:51] it was pure gold that thing spread like
[74:54] wildfire those two uh co- closely joined
[74:59] States went everywhere all across the
[75:01] Middle East the Levant uh Mediterranean
[75:04] across Europe but the world's and and it
[75:07] was stable for like almost 200 years
[75:09] until Napoleon came into Venice himself
[75:11] and took those beautiful statues home
[75:14] the horses you know it was stable and it
[75:17] worked for centuries so gold works and
[75:20] then the next real world's Reserve
[75:23] currency that lasted
[75:26] uh again for centuries was the Spanish
[75:29] uh real the Spanish silver dollar uh
[75:33] real Deo which means Pieces Of Eight if
[75:35] you ever watch any pirate movies you
[75:37] probably have thought of that pieces of
[75:39] eight and the uh gold es
[75:43] scuto and that was a gold-based uh
[75:46] system now what's really weird is that
[75:50] uh Spain suffered a lot you know
[75:53] Florence and Venice prospered but Spain
[75:56] suffered under the gold uh standard and
[75:59] the reason was because they discovered
[76:02] the new world and they'd have these
[76:04] gallions of gold and silver arrive and
[76:07] when they did they had massive inflation
[76:09] they called it the price Revolution and
[76:12] uh they then began to export all their
[76:14] manufacturing outside of the country and
[76:17] then they began to export their gold to
[76:19] bring in goods and this the wealth never
[76:22] transferred to the ordinary person in
[76:26] fact shop owners began to have their
[76:28] knees cut out from underneath them
[76:30] because they were being debased and of
[76:33] course what's really sad is that the
[76:35] Spanish government and the elites held
[76:37] most of the gold and they used it to
[76:39] fund endless Wars so gold can be good or
[76:43] bad just as Bitcoin can be good or bad
[76:47] and I mentioned this story because when
[76:49] you think about it it's kind of mirrors
[76:51] a little bit of what's happened to the
[76:53] United States ever since we became the
[76:55] world's Reserve currency and it's it's a
[76:58] kind of a sad State of Affairs for one
[77:01] thing Our Endless Wars and I'm
[77:03] definitely tired of those
[77:05] personally absolutely and it's
[77:08] uh if if you look outside of the United
[77:11] States there's a lot of um hate towards
[77:15] that and even inside of the United
[77:17] States you see a lot of um negative
[77:19] negative comments around that I just
[77:21] want to uh put that in as as an uh if
[77:24] people are interested in in that also um
[77:28] because it was such a popular video with
[77:30] stevenh uh paranoid P pinoid I don't
[77:34] know how how to to pronounce his last
[77:36] name yeah it's really interesting uh and
[77:39] uh it's my favorite Power law video that
[77:42] that I made it's also it was just a just
[77:46] a hit in general my top four videos with
[77:48] sailor Gary gona Max kais and and he was
[77:51] just really good also with that video um
[77:54] and there we talk uh and this was the
[77:57] first time I ever heard about that gold
[77:59] model because because Bitcoin grows
[78:03] because of two reasons the first the
[78:04] first reason is adoption more people
[78:07] getting into it and more people adopting
[78:09] it and the second is inflation because
[78:10] the underlying thing where we measure US
[78:12] dollar is just debasing um if you take
[78:15] that debasing out you have a better
[78:18] grasp of the adoption rate and I I like
[78:21] that power law way more than the the US
[78:23] dollar one uh because I'm not a fan in
[78:26] measuring something in US Dollars even
[78:29] though I acknowledge and I put it in my
[78:30] thumbnails I put it everywhere because
[78:32] that's the thing people see that that's
[78:35] the thing that gets the people attention
[78:37] and that's the thing most also talk
[78:39] about it's like when when we hit a new
[78:41] alltime high Austen mainstream TV what
[78:44] are you talking about it's the price and
[78:47] it's speculative those are the two
[78:49] things and the speculative part is also
[78:51] price so they only talk about the price
[78:53] which is sad but it's true
[78:56] yeah but it it doesn't surprise me I I
[78:57] think price uh I actually think price is
[79:01] very important price is driving a lot of
[79:03] the fomo it drives a lot of the interest
[79:06] it drives a lot of the adoption I don't
[79:08] have any issues as far as discussing or
[79:11] or I you know I look at the Bitcoin
[79:13] price I'm interested in it I think it
[79:16] tells me something about where we are in
[79:17] the
[79:18] cycles and uh people are GNA get at some
[79:22] point Robin there's gonna be a Tipping
[79:24] Point I don't know where it is I hope
[79:26] it's not a million of coin but at some
[79:29] point people are going to do fomo when
[79:32] they see some of these price points
[79:33] maybe it's 400,000 and again I mean I
[79:37] could easily see that happening this
[79:38] next cycle and so you don't you have you
[79:41] got to get as much Bitcoin as you can
[79:43] right now absolutely I talked with that
[79:45] with rogard also um I think on the
[79:47] second one where he was on um that most
[79:50] people will still be sleeping on bitcoin
[79:53] even if it's like a million
[79:55] uh because a lot of the prize
[79:57] appreciation comes from the big
[79:58] institutions from the the big players
[80:01] and Retail uh when we talk about the
[80:04] mainstream they will sleep a long time
[80:06] on that which is a sad sad reality
[80:09] because that's the that's the crowd we
[80:11] kind of want to adopt it first like my
[80:14] personal opinion is like I don't want
[80:16] America to buy Bitcoin now like I I I I
[80:18] I would love that Trump says like ah
[80:20] that Bitcoin thing let's not do it uh
[80:23] let's give the BL more time to buy that
[80:26] that would be probably uh longterm
[80:29] better it first of all gives me more
[80:31] time to buy I'm young I want I want more
[80:33] Bitcoin and not more US dollar value uh
[80:37] but it also would have a longer time to
[80:40] have that Grassroots movement in there
[80:42] but it's organic growth anyways I just
[80:44] don't I uh I don't think we much have I
[80:47] don't think we have much time left I
[80:49] really don't I uh you know I had that
[80:51] conversation with you uh once before and
[80:54] I mean I think think the trains leaving
[80:55] the station and I think there's going to
[80:57] be a lot of people that are on that
[80:59] platform that we're going to leave
[81:00] behind but again you know to my fellow
[81:02] bitcoiners and plebs out there you know
[81:04] just get as much Bitcoin as you can
[81:06] understand how to self-
[81:07] custody uh you know sometimes there are
[81:11] some people who are like I just had
[81:13] someone recently ask me about getting
[81:15] Bitcoin and I really paused because
[81:18] you've got to understand risk you know
[81:21] if you don't know if you can't
[81:23] understand risk you're not going to be
[81:25] able to understand Bitcoin you know I'll
[81:28] tell you a funny story about risk and I
[81:30] promise it won't be long but when I was
[81:32] working underground I was deep in the
[81:34] mine one night and uh our shifter the
[81:37] boss came up to me and he said hey you
[81:40] George and a flash he pointed another
[81:42] guy's flash grab a rod and I want you to
[81:44] go clean the uh roof and what he's
[81:47] talking about there is remember we're in
[81:48] a tunnel is he's talking about you would
[81:51] call it the ceiling what he wants us to
[81:53] do and what you know if you're 10,000
[81:55] feet below the Earth you know the Earth
[81:57] only wants to do one thing it wants to
[81:59] fill that hole back in so the rocks are
[82:02] always falling in there and if it
[82:04] doesn't fill it with rocks it fills it
[82:05] with water it'll flood real quick I mean
[82:08] real fast so we're down there and what
[82:10] he wants us to do is he wants us to take
[82:12] a steel rod and it's big it's those rods
[82:15] you used to drill for Dynamite holes and
[82:18] they're come in different sizes a short
[82:20] little one might weigh 50 pounds longer
[82:23] ones are like 75 88 pound and you walk
[82:25] down the tunnel for a long ways and
[82:28] you're holding it out in front of you
[82:29] like this poking at the ceiling trying
[82:32] to knock rocks down so it really is
[82:35] tiring and you know flash flash was he's
[82:39] like Jethro flash was not the brightest
[82:41] guy down there in the mine he was not a
[82:43] real dim he was not a bright light down
[82:46] there so he just you know he thought I
[82:48] don't feel like doing you know I don't
[82:50] care he just grabbed a short little Rod
[82:52] which means that as he's down there he's
[82:54] like he's got the rock right over the
[82:56] top of his head just about while he's
[82:57] poking at him and George you know my
[83:01] risk tolerance I knew what my risk
[83:03] tolerance was and I grabbed a really
[83:04] long rod and the reason I'm telling you
[83:07] this story is because it saved my life
[83:09] as we're walking side by side and Flash
[83:11] is just kind of poking at the things I I
[83:13] came up to the section and I put my rod
[83:16] up there and I just touched that I just
[83:18] touched the top of the the tunnel and
[83:20] when I did a slab came down as big as a
[83:23] Volkswagen I mean right in front of me
[83:25] it it took that steel rod smashed it out
[83:28] of my hands bent it all the Smither
[83:30] rings and I actually felt The Rock in
[83:32] front of my face come down and I
[83:34] screamed like a little girl kind of down
[83:36] there in the mine but the bottom line is
[83:39] if if you don't understand your wrist
[83:40] tolerance you're going to get hurt and
[83:43] so I thought for a long time about this
[83:45] person that asked me and I I thought
[83:47] well what is her wrist tolerance what
[83:48] can she handle and you know what I told
[83:51] her I said just buy the uh just buy the
[83:55] ETF you know just get the Bitcoin ETF
[83:58] and I I think that was all she could
[84:01] handle right then and then I figure if
[84:03] she gets used to it maybe I can get her
[84:05] into cold storage and a hardware wallet
[84:08] and uh so you know just get as much
[84:10] Bitcoin as you can right now store it in
[84:13] any way you can that's safe where you're
[84:14] not going to make a mistake uh and and
[84:17] lose it absolutely and I think that's an
[84:20] an honest advice because most Bitcoin
[84:24] get lost not because they get hacked or
[84:26] stolen they get lost because of user
[84:29] error and uh that's the worst kind of
[84:32] losing it if if if you get hacked or
[84:35] stolen at least you can blame it on
[84:37] someone else yeah a little bit you can
[84:40] you you can still blame yourself because
[84:42] you should have uh protected it better
[84:45] but at least there's some sort of like
[84:47] oh like but if you just it's if it's a
[84:49] pure user error then it's like 100% your
[84:52] fault and that's uh that's always the
[84:54] heartbreaking stories and those are all
[84:56] over Twitter like even in 2024 and they
[84:59] probably will come out in 2025 again so
[85:02] this these things happened the latest
[85:03] one was I think some Ledger thing where
[85:06] uh he lost his backup and he uh put the
[85:10] pin three times wrong and now it's gone
[85:13] uh so like those things happen and if
[85:16] you don't know what you're doing um
[85:19] don't have it in self custody educate
[85:21] yourself and once you feel confident
[85:23] then have it in custody yeah exactly
[85:25] that's the better way to do it yeah
[85:28] really cool uh we are already at one and
[85:29] a half hours went by like crazy that
[85:32] time um I have one question wait wait a
[85:36] minute before you do that I got
[85:37] something because remember when you air
[85:40] this we're going to be almost the time
[85:42] for president Trump to get inaugurated
[85:45] right oh let's celebrate well we're
[85:49] going to celebrate in just a minute here
[85:51] so I'm gonna pour myself a glass of
[85:52] whiskey here for those of you who are
[85:55] driving and not watching this and it's a
[85:58] good
[85:59] whiskey and then what I want to say
[86:02] before we end this is is this we are
[86:04] only days away from what I think will be
[86:09] the pardoning of Ross oook that he's
[86:12] going to be released from
[86:13] prison and I and we're going to see
[86:16] sunshine on his face and he's going to
[86:18] get a tan and I I have written to his ex
[86:23] account Twitter and uh I hope other
[86:25] people do and I've told him when I see
[86:28] your face in the sunshine when you're
[86:31] out of prison and you put up a QR code
[86:33] or whatever it is and you know his
[86:35] family maintains his X account right now
[86:39] uh when you hold up something I've got
[86:41] some SATs and I'm G to send them your
[86:44] way and so uh I'd like us to you know I
[86:48] hope we start this guy out on a really
[86:51] great path and you know that would be a
[86:53] really nice way to tell the authorities
[86:54] out there to basically go yourself
[86:57] you know giving him two life sentences
[86:59] back to back with no parole to spend his
[87:01] life in
[87:02] prison as an example he was made you
[87:05] know as an example so I I'm going to
[87:07] give a toast this is to you Ross I'm
[87:10] looking forward to seeing your face out
[87:12] there and getting a
[87:13] tan here
[87:15] here I I unfortunately don't have
[87:18] whiskey but I have water in a beer glass
[87:20] does this count good enough good enough
[87:23] all right so what were you going to ask
[87:25] me uh Robin I have uh I think I did it
[87:28] last time also with you the question
[87:29] that ask each and one of my guests uh
[87:31] what we can learn from you besides
[87:33] Bitcoin well let's go back to that let's
[87:37] go back to that buy borrow die Dynasty
[87:42] let's go back to fedt fedt gives you the
[87:45] power to become a guardian and and other
[87:49] people with just a cell phone and a QR
[87:52] code can enter enter your space your
[87:54] little island that you've
[87:56] made and in the future if if things kind
[87:59] of get nasty and you know if it's a
[88:02] difficult world out there just remember
[88:04] uh bitcoiners that you know you've got
[88:06] to hold on to your Bitcoin don't sell
[88:08] that Bitcoin don't do the like these
[88:11] long-term holders these idiots that sold
[88:13] in this last rally hold on to your
[88:16] Bitcoin and wait for a future day where
[88:19] you can become that guardian and you can
[88:22] pass this on to other people people that
[88:24] you love people that are you know for
[88:26] your family and we all every one of us
[88:29] out there we've all tried to orange pill
[88:31] our family you know and sometimes we
[88:34] come off like some nut but the bottom
[88:37] line is we're doing it because we we
[88:39] love people you know and we see what's
[88:41] coming and we're just trying to help
[88:43] them so if if they're not if your
[88:46] friends your family if they're not
[88:47] listening to you just build generational
[88:49] wealth so that sometime in the future
[88:52] you know you're that person that uh
[88:54] people look up to and do it you know
[88:57] with all that wealth you create you know
[88:59] do something good I I mean whether it's
[89:01] you know even if it's just mining but do
[89:04] something good we're going to have
[89:05] people this next cycle that are going to
[89:07] be very wealthy and it's Newfound wealth
[89:09] so do something creative look at me
[89:11] right now look in this studio right now
[89:14] uh you know do something with your time
[89:17] that's worthwhile and help other people
[89:20] and that's all I got to say I guess I
[89:23] love that message lot that's really cool
[89:25] I love that um and I will just leave it
[89:28] at at that and uh we have uh ENT in the
[89:31] podcast as you know where had the
[89:33] previous guest is asking a question for
[89:34] the next guest without knowing who the
[89:36] next guest actually is uh I think really
[89:39] exciting because I think we I don't know
[89:41] if you ever talked about that uh on any
[89:44] podcast what benefits do you see coming
[89:47] from the nostr
[89:49] protocol oh wow you know I
[89:52] uh boy that's a good question I you know
[89:55] I at the encouragement of uh Walker
[89:59] mainly I uh used uh Noster about a year
[90:02] and a half ago maybe a year but you know
[90:05] I I hate to say this it was so clunky
[90:08] for me for my enjoyment I just didn't
[90:12] enjoy it
[90:13] so what I would like to see is something
[90:16] that's less clunky more user friendly
[90:20] and I'd like to get on board with Noster
[90:23] and now I hate to say this I already
[90:25] lost my damn key to it so I'm going to
[90:27] have to start a new
[90:29] account uh but I will and and I think
[90:33] didn't you uh before I before I say that
[90:37] end this didn't you also recently talk
[90:40] about this or someone there's uh there's
[90:43] a particular is it Primal that people
[90:45] are using now on yeah so like I I also
[90:48] have a similar story actually one and a
[90:50] half years ago I also went on Nostra I
[90:52] also lost my keys
[90:54] uh and I also had to start over I think
[90:57] like one or two months ago um
[91:00] thanksfully to my existing accounts it
[91:02] just took like I think three days to get
[91:05] more followers than I had before and
[91:07] other ones um but uh Primal is really
[91:12] good and I had the same feeling that it
[91:14] was clunky one and a half years ago and
[91:16] it feels way better now like I really
[91:18] love Primal and for example Dr jef Ross
[91:22] uh if you familiar with with him he was
[91:24] is's also really popular he's now only
[91:27] on on Nostra I mean I
[91:30] recommend not to be only a Nostra
[91:33] because we have to Orange Peel um the
[91:36] world and the world is not a Nostra so I
[91:39] feel like we need the soldiers on
[91:40] Twitter on Instagram on Tik Tok and
[91:42] stuff I agree completely so tag Jeff
[91:46] Ross and tell him that Jethro said or
[91:48] George Bodin said get your ass back to X
[91:52] so that we can
[91:54] so that we can actually orange pill more
[91:56] people because he's got a great message
[91:58] but he needs to get it out on x2 and
[92:01] plus that way I can DM him easily
[92:03] anytime I want say hi yeah he he
[92:06] actually said it uh since he went only
[92:09] on X it is way harder to stay in touch
[92:13] with people he's like he because even if
[92:15] you're on for example for me and I
[92:18] communicated with him I look at Primal
[92:21] maybe once a week so if he sends me a
[92:23] message it might take like five days to
[92:25] re uh get back to him because yeah I
[92:27] just don't see it on Twitter uh it
[92:30] usually takes me not even like a day
[92:33] like I ride back really fast because I'm
[92:35] like 200 times on Twitter each day so
[92:38] the LA so the last thing I'll say is
[92:40] this then regarding Noster you know make
[92:42] it for old Boomers old farts like me you
[92:45] know that uh struggle sometimes with
[92:47] technology just make it easy so that we
[92:50] can get on there and and start
[92:52] communicating and connect conect with
[92:54] our friends and and networks and stuff
[92:57] and and then I'm all for it I'm on board
[92:59] I'll zap people I mean I got a great
[93:02] lightning wallet I'm ready to go really
[93:04] cool perfect thank you so much George uh
