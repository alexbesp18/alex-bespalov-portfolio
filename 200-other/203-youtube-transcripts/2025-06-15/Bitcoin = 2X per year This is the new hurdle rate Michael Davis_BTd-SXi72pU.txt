[00:00] for people who understand Bitcoins going
[00:02] up 100% a year anytime you're choosing
[00:04] to spend money on something you're like
[00:06] am I comfortable spending twice as much
[00:08] on this or am I comfortable spending
[00:10] three times as much as today's price
[00:13] because that's the opportunity that I'm
[00:15] choosing to forego Bitcoin is now your
[00:17] hurdle rate as a business investor if
[00:20] this opportunity doesn't have more than
[00:23] a 50% chance of 100% annual return
[00:27] you're probably misallocating your
[00:29] resources this is legit the Industrial
[00:31] Revolution for the digital world Bitcoin
[00:33] is the solution honestly to these
[00:36] political career politicians I don't
[00:38] think they'll exist under a Bitcoin
[00:40] standard Bitcoin will be very healthy
[00:42] considering our current Global debt
[00:44] situation because Bitcoin is a savings
[00:47] technology and the technological
[00:49] innovation is that it incentivizes
[00:52] people to save rather than to spend
[00:54] Bitcoin is freedom money I love it for
[00:56] the fact that it's kind of the opposite
[00:58] of what Fiat represents which I see it
[01:01] as a form of
[01:02] [Music]
[01:05] slavery if if we're going to do this
[01:07] let's do this you know I'm not uh I'm
[01:10] not hiding I'm uh if they want to come
[01:13] for me and uh take my Bitcoin uh bring
[01:16] it
[01:17] on love that attitude a lot very cool uh
[01:22] yeah then let's let's get started hi
[01:24] Michael how you doing everything fine uh
[01:26] doing well Robin I appreciate you having
[01:28] me on uh perfect amazing um and it's
[01:32] your first ever podcast and this is
[01:35] like really interesting for me to see
[01:37] when people get to the first ever po
[01:40] podcast uh and you thought like should I
[01:42] do it should I not do it what what was
[01:45] the main thing that you're like okay I I
[01:47] want to speak about Bitcoin publicly I
[01:49] want to get the the void the the the
[01:51] message out there yeah I guess
[01:55] uh you know maybe what you're doing is
[01:58] uh part of my motivation
[02:00] for stepping up and uh just throwing my
[02:04] voice in the ring here um you know
[02:07] you've had a lot of people on your show
[02:09] that
[02:11] 99.9% of uh people trying to grow a
[02:15] channel wouldn't consider and uh I think
[02:17] that that's a very Noble worthwhile
[02:20] thing and uh just want to be supportive
[02:24] and uh you know provide what value I can
[02:27] to the
[02:28] community yeah and I think you can
[02:30] provide a lot of value and a lot of what
[02:32] you're doing and you we had a little
[02:34] talk before we started the podcast and I
[02:36] loved what you're saying about Bitcoin
[02:39] is investment and savings it just does
[02:42] all those things uh together maybe let's
[02:45] start off with that um what is bitcoin
[02:48] for you and and and uh repeat like what
[02:51] what you said earlier with like Bitcoin
[02:53] is all all those things and then let's
[02:56] break it down a little bit so B coin is
[03:00] a lot of things
[03:02] and that's part of why you're able to
[03:04] get away with putting out a new podcast
[03:07] every day is because it is that nuanced
[03:10] and every person that becomes interested
[03:14] in Bitcoin puts their they reflect their
[03:17] own value sets on the Bitcoin so for me
[03:21] what that means
[03:23] is the things that I value are going to
[03:26] be similar in some ways but also
[03:28] slightly different than
[03:30] just about anyone
[03:33] so I
[03:36] mean it kind of it's kind of hard to say
[03:39] exactly where to start with that
[03:41] question but for me ultimately Bitcoin
[03:44] is freedom money I love it
[03:48] for the fact that it's kind of the
[03:50] opposite of what Fiat represents which I
[03:53] see I see it as a form of slavery that
[03:57] you know it's a soft form we're not
[03:59] forced to use Fiat
[04:02] but at the end of the day you kind of
[04:04] are I mean it's hard to function in this
[04:08] world without you know participating in
[04:11] that and I think that Bitcoin maximalist
[04:14] can Envision a world where we can choose
[04:18] to not operate in their system and that
[04:23] that's the Hope in the vision I think
[04:24] for that that keeps me motivated and uh
[04:27] makes me want to contribute
[04:30] is when we look back in history with
[04:33] slavery uh it's really interesting for
[04:34] me and I made I think this was one of my
[04:37] first viral posts actually on Twitter
[04:39] where I compared like the slavery that
[04:43] has happened years ago in the in the
[04:46] past to what we have now with the fear
[04:48] system and there are surprisingly a lot
[04:51] of similarities but obviously in the
[04:54] methods of slavery it's a whole
[04:56] different level it's a whole different
[04:57] thing it's a as you said soft slave y uh
[05:01] it's a good word to describe it um will
[05:03] we get past this like is is is that a
[05:07] thing that is right now there or will
[05:10] governments always be in the position
[05:12] where they can print money and where
[05:14] they can extract value uh without asking
[05:18] for taxes and asking for
[05:21] fees
[05:23] um it depends it's up to us actually I
[05:27] believe I don't think that there's any
[05:30] reasonable possibility that they could
[05:32] enforce uh slavery on global population
[05:36] with the numbers we have as people uh
[05:39] without without it being
[05:41] voluntary
[05:44] so I like to take the Jeff Booth
[05:46] approach to that concept I think Bitcoin
[05:50] has already won this this uh question
[05:52] you're talking about it's just a matter
[05:55] of people understanding and recognizing
[05:58] it and I think that's just a matter of
[06:02] the speed of the distribution of
[06:03] knowledge
[06:05] which I'm I'm thinking 8 to 12 years
[06:08] before we're talking
[06:12] about how much better things are on a
[06:14] Bitcoin
[06:16] standard that's an amazing um I rarely
[06:19] do that but uh we have the tin as you're
[06:22] well aware uh where the previous guest
[06:24] is asking a question for the next guest
[06:26] and uh this end routine just fits really
[06:30] nicely in here so will put it now uh and
[06:34] and the question for me was in my head
[06:36] like that why are people still uh not
[06:40] getting Bitcoin and the Andro team
[06:41] question from the previous guest was
[06:43] what is the best way to accelerate
[06:45] Bitcoin adoption and it's like
[06:49] when just talking about it it it's it's
[06:53] air it's a miracle uh and I think it's a
[06:56] Bonafide miracle in the sense that this
[07:00] thing is happening whether anyone knows
[07:02] about it or wants wants it to happen
[07:05] it's
[07:06] already it's been happening for 15 years
[07:10] it's growing at an accelerating rate
[07:13] and you can try to ignore it but that
[07:17] will only be to your detriment in my
[07:20] opinion
[07:22] um I'm trying to tell as many people
[07:26] about it as I can on a regular basis
[07:29] because this is a total Paradigm Shift
[07:31] we've never seen anything like this in
[07:33] our lifetimes I mean this is legit like
[07:37] the Industrial Revolution for the
[07:39] digital world that's what's happening
[07:41] right
[07:43] now yeah it's it's also fascinating for
[07:45] me when we see the revolutions going on
[07:48] I I we had uh episode with with the guys
[07:51] one where I asked him what is bigger
[07:54] like the interet revolution or the the
[07:56] Bitcoin Revolution uh and he went on
[08:00] like I think 20 minutes streak where
[08:02] where he talked about exactly that do
[08:05] you also see it I think he kind of came
[08:07] to the conclusion they are complimenting
[08:09] each other and the internet would not be
[08:11] a good thing without Bitcoin it it kind
[08:15] of gets in a dystopian thing yeah I I
[08:19] can definitely agree with a lot of what
[08:21] he had to say about that
[08:23] philosophically um I would say on top of
[08:26] that I would say that these things they
[08:28] don't only complement each other they
[08:30] actually synergize so what what I mean
[08:34] by synergize is I think you have the
[08:37] Internet by itself is one thing you have
[08:40] Bitcoin by itself is another thing
[08:43] combined they more than equal the
[08:46] Bitcoin plus the Internet it's like this
[08:49] third thing that is like 10 times more
[08:53] powerful than either one of them
[08:55] separately it's it's uh it's really cool
[08:59] uh but let's let's get to the to the
[09:00] question that I actually had uh in store
[09:02] for you um as you it's your first
[09:05] podcast um maybe who are you and and
[09:09] what are you doing in in Bitcoin and how
[09:10] was your your Bitcoin
[09:12] Journey yeah that's a good question um I
[09:15] would
[09:16] say I'm just a normal guy uh born and
[09:20] raised in Michigan uh done a little
[09:23] traveling I did commercial fishing in
[09:25] Alaska for six years uh after graduating
[09:29] from Bible College up there um so that
[09:33] was super interesting I did that through
[09:35] college and uh and afterwards been
[09:37] married for 14 years almost 15 years now
[09:41] I met her when I was five and she was
[09:43] four and uh we' grew up as friends and
[09:46] uh one day the the scales were lifted
[09:50] from my eyes and I saw the wondrous
[09:53] Beauty I had before me and uh I'm very
[09:56] thankful for how that's worked out um
[10:00] but no it's it a lot of things in life
[10:04] are like that I guess from my experience
[10:06] I think Bitcoin has been like that
[10:08] where I I guess I'll speak to my uh
[10:12] Bitcoin Journey Rabbit Hole whatever um
[10:16] I had a friend that told me about it in
[10:17] 2011 he was a he was a web developer
[10:21] from high school like in the late 90s
[10:24] early 2000s he always knew all about uh
[10:28] everything going on in the Tex space and
[10:30] he we were joking about mining uh
[10:32] Bitcoin in 2011 as this like fake you
[10:36] know internet scam that people were uh
[10:39] trying to pull off and he's like hey if
[10:41] we got a thousand Bitcoin this could be
[10:43] like worth millions of dollars Someday
[10:45] I'm like no way this is stupid you know
[10:49] this is they're just trying to get
[10:50] people to give them their money um so
[10:53] that's that was my initial contact point
[10:55] and obviously that's you know not the
[10:58] way it worked out
[10:59] uh
[11:01] overall had a good friend uh kind of put
[11:05] it back on my radar back in 2017 uh
[11:09] December when we had that big run up to
[11:11] like 17 18,000 I'm like what in the
[11:15] world is going on here like how could
[11:18] this fake random internet thing uh be be
[11:21] garnering this much attention how could
[11:23] people want to spend 20 grand on a
[11:26] what's a bitcoin you know um
[11:30] but I was in the middle of growing a
[11:31] startup company and uh didn't really
[11:35] have time to figure it out or at least I
[11:37] that's what I thought was true because I
[11:39] was you know trying to grow a company
[11:41] and uh working 10 hours a day six or
[11:45] seven days a week and just didn't want
[11:47] to take the time to even think about it
[11:49] really it seemed too risky even if I
[11:51] thought there might be some potential
[11:53] with it
[11:55] um 2020 I uh a friend of mine told me
[12:00] about Jeff Booth and the price of
[12:02] tomorrow and I got that on audiobook and
[12:05] I'm just like this guy is talking about
[12:09] some
[12:10] really crazy stuff but it makes perfect
[12:13] sense with the you know we should be
[12:16] having deflation with all this new
[12:18] technology we should uh be experiencing
[12:21] the benefits of these things and it
[12:22] seems like things are getting worse and
[12:24] that doesn't really make
[12:26] sense a that's a big step and it's it's
[12:30] it's for me also interesting always to
[12:32] see those stories uh when when people
[12:34] talk about their Bitcoin Journey uh
[12:38] because you always see there's a point
[12:41] where they dismissed it as I also did
[12:44] for three years because thought it's a
[12:46] scam uh and and then there's this point
[12:49] where either the environment or the
[12:52] price or a friend or anything pushed him
[12:55] or her to look at it twice and really
[13:00] look at it and then you're like oh it
[13:02] could be something or oh [ __ ] that is
[13:04] actually true what they say and and then
[13:06] it's like this ego humbling machine uh
[13:09] where like oh yes I made a mistake I was
[13:12] looking at it wrong but now I have to go
[13:16] over my ego and say I was wrong uh and
[13:20] especially hurtful when you have to say
[13:21] it publicly uh as for example Michael
[13:24] saor did because he said U Bitcoin days
[13:28] are numbered in like 2013 or something
[13:30] like that like way before he came in uh
[13:33] a lot of other people and I think to
[13:36] this day the people that start out as
[13:39] big Bitcoin critics as bit as almost
[13:43] maybe even like Bitcoin haters they will
[13:46] become the biggest Bitcoin
[13:48] Bulls uh because they really said like
[13:51] oh it's but when they make a switch they
[13:54] will make the switch massively yeah it's
[13:58] well you have the people who are the
[13:59] most outspoken in
[14:01] society and they're going to be
[14:03] outspoken about whatever their opinion
[14:05] is and if that opinion
[14:07] changes based on facts then they tend to
[14:12] go a 180 and become proponents of the
[14:15] very thing that they were persecuting
[14:17] previously absolutely and and you also
[14:19] talked that you were in the in the Bible
[14:21] College uh it's it's some I can I can
[14:25] imagine a Bible College like a Christian
[14:28] thing
[14:29] it was it is a Christian University uh
[14:33] you know I went there it was really
[14:36] inexpensive and I wanted to get out of
[14:39] my parents house I thought you know this
[14:42] could be a really good way to learn more
[14:45] about God and not go into debt until I
[14:48] figure out what I'm going to be doing
[14:50] for a career I didn't really have any uh
[14:53] significant ideas that I thought would
[14:56] uh be worth pursuing at that time so I'm
[14:58] just like like let's go off and have an
[15:00] adventure not not rack up you know
[15:04] meaningless debt and uh just see what
[15:08] happens I ended up with an amazing
[15:11] experience there got to grow up got to
[15:14] you know learn about what I truly
[15:16] believe and dedicate the time to really
[15:19] figuring that out versus kind of getting
[15:22] into a later stage of life before I
[15:26] figured out more about who I am I guess
[15:31] it was an accelerated period of
[15:34] self-discovery and I think understanding
[15:36] the world in a in a better way yeah and
[15:40] it's it's uh it's interesting for me
[15:42] also to see a lot of religious people
[15:45] are in Bitcoin it's a a lot of people
[15:48] who are in in I can tell you
[15:51] why please religious people Christians I
[15:54] think uh most prominently are used to
[15:58] looking at the world from a different
[16:01] system we have we have an advantage like
[16:04] even somebody who's been raised in
[16:07] religious circles but doesn't personally
[16:09] em have a Embrace a faith they already
[16:14] understand the mindset that it takes to
[16:16] understand a system outside of the
[16:17] current system that's yeah I never heard
[16:21] that because when when you have uh and
[16:24] already when you have one thing and this
[16:27] is also with Bitcoin true uh once you
[16:29] get Bitcoin and you accept that there is
[16:32] something completely different from the
[16:33] mainstream there like oh that's that's
[16:36] true that's actually we don't need
[16:39] inflation actually inflation is bad and
[16:42] and then you have the sound money thing
[16:44] that you adopt in your head and like
[16:46] what what else is not true like is is
[16:49] that not not true is that not true uh
[16:51] could there be something and then you're
[16:53] open to the idea that uh there's
[16:56] something outside of the mainstream like
[16:58] you you step out of the line and all of
[17:00] the sudden you you you see uh things
[17:03] from a different well you can you can I
[17:05] can actually also go just there I don't
[17:07] need to go directly in that lane I can
[17:10] also just pursue my own thing in that
[17:12] lane so yeah never looked at it that way
[17:15] from that the that the Christians have
[17:18] an advantage in that sense because they
[17:20] kind of look at it in a different sense
[17:24] at all yeah cool yeah I mean as a
[17:28] Christian I don't believe that this
[17:29] physical tangible world is the end of
[17:32] things I believe that there's another
[17:34] dimension where God exists and that he
[17:37] communicates with us in this Dimension
[17:40] and
[17:42] so I'm already used to thinking about
[17:45] the world in a different way so when the
[17:49] idea of Bitcoin comes up and the the
[17:52] premise is laid out it's like this is
[17:56] this is logical this is health healthy
[18:00] this
[18:01] is beneficial to
[18:04] society we should want this and it turns
[18:08] out it's happening whether we want it or
[18:09] not so I mean uh why not embrace the
[18:14] inevitable and choose Bitcoin I mean
[18:18] it's a much better Financial system than
[18:22] anything we've ever considered before
[18:24] and I don't think that there's really
[18:27] any realistic chance we're going to come
[18:29] up with something better yeah I also
[18:30] don't think so it's it's uh when we on
[18:33] the religious side it's it's God's
[18:37] money it's the most Fair money I think
[18:41] that humans are capable of coming up
[18:44] with
[18:45] and if that if that's all it is I think
[18:49] that's good enough and the total
[18:52] addressable Market is all the money
[18:54] which is you know people have their own
[18:56] ideas about what that number is but it's
[19:00] all the stuff denominated in in Bitcoin
[19:03] is is the value of
[19:05] Bitcoin I mean when Bitcoin is actually
[19:07] money and everybody accepts it as money
[19:09] at some point uh Bitcoin is 50% of
[19:13] everything because in every transaction
[19:15] everything that we are doing there is
[19:17] money involved in that I mean there's B
[19:20] but uh it's it's it's like money is on
[19:23] the global
[19:24] scale Bitcoin is the counterpart to the
[19:28] stuff
[19:29] it's the it's the mirror reflection so
[19:33] when we're valuing things if we're
[19:36] trying to use a fiat currency we're
[19:38] using a mirror that's from like one of
[19:41] those clown houses that distorts things
[19:43] and we can't really tell if we're short
[19:45] or if we're tall or if we're fat or if
[19:48] we're skinny it's distorting our
[19:52] perception of reality and what Bitcoin
[19:55] is it's just a mirror that tells us the
[19:58] truth yeah 100% I love it so much
[20:01] because it's a reflection of our values
[20:03] as you said in the beginning uh that
[20:06] that we put the values that we self have
[20:10] onto Bitcoin and it's like a reflection
[20:13] of that it's a mirror of that uh and
[20:15] it's it's funny for me to see uh the the
[20:19] discussions online on on Twitter when
[20:22] people are like oh no bitcoiners have to
[20:24] be like weak no bitcoiners have to be uh
[20:27] only eating meat and and and then it's
[20:29] like no Bitcoin is that Bitcoin is that
[20:30] but in the end of the day it's kind of
[20:33] nothing and everything at once it's like
[20:35] it's just it's just a tool that's there
[20:38] uh it's apolitical uh but it people put
[20:43] something on it and that that makes it
[20:46] really interesting for me to see that
[20:48] there's there's something that's we also
[20:49] talked about before about the concept of
[20:52] Bitcoin is fluid uh it gets it's it's
[20:56] just there and it's it's pushes forward
[20:58] in the direction that it's just pushes
[21:00] forward it would be interesting to to
[21:02] see this whole whole thing playing out
[21:04] there the thing is we have two different
[21:07] things going on at the same time we have
[21:09] on the one hand Bitcoin
[21:12] is completely objective and unchangeable
[21:15] but
[21:16] then the value extrapolation component
[21:20] of it is something that we all
[21:22] individually determine so it's it's a
[21:26] dichotomy is what's going on
[21:32] do do you see the adoption being similar
[21:34] to the early internet to to like the
[21:38] 1998 1997 before the the big
[21:42] uh bubble was there I I I I obviously I
[21:47] was born in 1998 I would say I would say
[21:50] not as much as it's not a straight
[21:52] comparison and there's a few reasons why
[21:54] I think that's true um the first reason
[21:58] I would say that the comparison breaks
[22:00] down
[22:02] is I think that there was a lot less uh
[22:05] at
[22:07] stake
[22:08] uh from a perception standpoint for
[22:11] nation states so fat currency is a very
[22:17] obvious power Vector for nation
[22:21] states they all know what Bitcoin is
[22:24] okay it's just a matter of if it's going
[22:27] to become big enough to cause problems
[22:29] and we know that it
[22:31] is but um
[22:34] so yeah I would just say
[22:38] that uh the internet wasn't really like
[22:41] that it there there was some potential
[22:43] for them to not be able to control
[22:45] information but I think that that's
[22:47] easier to control even within a somewhat
[22:50] democratized or
[22:52] decentralized uh you know you
[22:55] have the internet which is kind of
[22:59] what Bitcoin is to money you have the
[23:00] internet is to information but if they
[23:03] control the algorithm or Google controls
[23:06] the algorithm that shows you what
[23:09] information they want you to
[23:11] see it it's kind of like controlled
[23:13] opposition in a way uh I don't think
[23:16] Bitcoin really has that component and
[23:19] therefore it's much more dangerous to
[23:21] the existing system it it's going to
[23:26] mathematically determine
[23:29] outcomes for Nations and there's going
[23:31] to be no way around that you can you can
[23:35] uh put out propaganda and control the
[23:39] narrative through
[23:41] information you can't do that with with
[23:44] money in the same way that that gets
[23:46] people to believe something that isn't
[23:50] true if that makes
[23:52] sense yeah I mean I I think about that a
[23:54] lot
[23:56] because I feel like in the western world
[23:58] the pain is just not high enough it's
[24:00] like uh inflation is is high people talk
[24:05] about it but not that much and I I watch
[24:09] my the European election debates because
[24:12] I'm curious about what the topics are
[24:14] I'm I'm not that c curious about the
[24:16] positions because they are pretty you
[24:18] you know what the politicians will say
[24:20] but I'm curious like what topics they're
[24:22] discussing yes inflation is one of the
[24:25] topics but it's actually a pretty small
[24:28] topic in the European elections and in
[24:30] the Austrian VI of the European election
[24:34] where I'm living um and pretty extremely
[24:37] big is migration again with uh the
[24:41] Ukraine war how to handle Putin that's a
[24:44] really big topic right now and I'm like
[24:47] it yes it is a big topic but it's not
[24:50] the only topic it's like the the the one
[24:53] topic that they always discuss and it's
[24:55] it kind of gets uh gets even annoying
[24:58] that it's so present uh and and there
[25:01] are not too many other topics like there
[25:04] inflation is a little bit there ah yes
[25:06] what should we do with immigration and
[25:08] stuff like that but no word about
[25:10] Bitcoin no word about cryptos in in in
[25:13] America it's different yeah I know what
[25:16] you're talking about and it's really
[25:18] easy I think to get sucked
[25:21] into hoping that politics will change
[25:24] things for the better um and a can and
[25:28] it has
[25:29] before but it's always
[25:32] temporary um because somebody gets in
[25:35] for a couple years four years five years
[25:38] whatever the term is they make some
[25:40] changes that you wanted to
[25:42] see people grow complacent and then
[25:46] somebody comes in and undoes all those
[25:48] good things and it gets worse and then
[25:50] they you it I just think
[25:53] that it's almost a distraction from the
[25:57] the real solution which is fixing the
[26:00] money if you take the money
[26:01] printer out of their hands and they
[26:04] can't make these promises to
[26:06] redistribute other people's wealth
[26:09] then they're going to have a really hard
[26:12] time selling the things that they're
[26:14] selling right
[26:15] now they're going to actually have to
[26:17] provide value if they want to get
[26:19] elected and that's Bitcoin is the
[26:23] solution honestly to these political
[26:28] you know career politicians I don't
[26:31] think they'll exist under a Bitcoin
[26:32] standard and if they
[26:34] do it will be because that everyone
[26:37] agrees that person needs to be in that
[26:39] position because of the value that
[26:41] they're providing to society I think
[26:43] there's a really good chance that by the
[26:45] time bukel comes up for you know I I
[26:50] think he's he's serving his second term
[26:52] which I think the term limits I think
[26:54] the demand might be so high for him to
[26:56] continue that he may not have a choice
[26:58] even if he wants to step down it's
[27:00] fascinating for me to
[27:02] see Salvador's thing
[27:06] and I want to get into El Salvador a
[27:08] little later uh but you mentioned
[27:10] something really interesting uh we only
[27:14] have something when we put value to it
[27:17] this means all of the also we only pay
[27:20] for government functions that we
[27:23] actually value for example I would be
[27:26] definitely okay with some centralized
[27:29] organization in Austria cleaning the
[27:32] streets uh holding the streets in a good
[27:35] condition uh and like it's and it has a
[27:39] lot of advantages also to not pay for
[27:42] each turn you take and and pay some
[27:43] other private person and and see how you
[27:46] how you get on the streets uh and it
[27:48] doesn't have to be organized with taxes
[27:51] it can be just service based and I heard
[27:54] that a lot with bitcoiners who think
[27:56] when when Bitcoin is fully adopted we
[27:58] kind of switch to a a optional
[28:01] service-based uh government function
[28:04] that will be completely different than
[28:07] uh we are now used to and it's for me
[28:10] really hard to imagine that world uh but
[28:14] I I can see it because Bitcoin is so
[28:17] different than the field system uh why
[28:21] should not be the political system also
[28:23] be completely different what what do you
[28:25] think so this is I think it's pretty
[28:27] simple
[28:29] if a person that's running for an office
[28:32] can't promise to give money to special
[28:37] interest group like they don't have the
[28:40] ability to deliver on that promise and
[28:42] everybody knows that that's not going to
[28:45] happen they lose their ability to
[28:48] persuade the public to vote for
[28:51] them and at that point they have to
[28:54] actually have a proposal that provides
[28:57] real value you and how they're going to
[28:59] accomplish that in a tangible
[29:03] way I think that Bitcoin forces people
[29:06] to be smarter about the things that
[29:09] people are telling them like hey is this
[29:12] realistically financially
[29:15] possible well if the answer is no and
[29:18] you can't print money then you're a liar
[29:22] and everybody knows it if you are
[29:24] listening to this podcast you might be
[29:26] wondering what is actually the setup
[29:28] look like of Robin or how can I improve
[29:30] my Bitcoin setup and there's two things
[29:33] you have to buy Bitcoin from the right
[29:34] source and you have to store Bitcoin the
[29:37] right way let's focus on the first thing
[29:39] how to buy Bitcoin it's simple have a
[29:41] Bitcoin only exchange don't deal with
[29:44] the shitcoin exchanges don't deal with
[29:45] an exchange that has an own token or
[29:47] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[29:50] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[29:53] for me the best partner for that and now
[29:57] where do you store it Bitcoin Bitcoin
[29:58] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[30:01] a self custody solution where you
[30:04] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[30:07] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[30:10] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[30:13] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[30:15] fras and you are better than 95% of all
[30:19] Bitcoin holders if you have more than a,
[30:22] in Bitcoin it's an absolutely must have
[30:25] one last thing before we get back to the
[30:27] video I'm really passionate about
[30:28] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[30:31] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[30:34] in June the Bitcoin Brock conference
[30:37] it's the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[30:40] conference in whole of Europe for all
[30:42] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[30:45] this place in June for all europes it's
[30:47] a must go anyways you are so close to
[30:50] the Bitcoin Pride conference you
[30:51] basically have to come I will do
[30:53] interviews there and I would love to
[30:56] meet you all there use code Robin for
[30:59] all my sponsors to get discounts and use
[31:01] the links down in the description and
[31:03] there's also a common theme that I saw
[31:05] uh except of one party in Austria
[31:08] everyone wanted to like say oh no we
[31:10] have to spend here more money no no no I
[31:12] we we should spend here more money and
[31:15] nobody was like let's cut some money
[31:18] let's let's like let's dial a little bit
[31:20] back let's let's cut those budges let
[31:22] cut those budges they all like no no we
[31:25] have to uh re we have to put more money
[31:28] towards that we have to put more money
[31:30] that we have to build out that and I'm
[31:32] like I don't think they have um income
[31:36] problem they have like an expense
[31:38] problem when I look at governments in
[31:39] the serice but uh let's not go to get
[31:42] too much into
[31:44] politics real quick on that last on that
[31:47] last point you made uh Bitcoin will be
[31:49] very healthy considering our current
[31:52] Global debt situation because Bitcoin is
[31:56] sa a savings Tech
[31:58] technology and the technological
[32:01] innovation is that it incentivizes
[32:04] people to save rather than to spend so
[32:09] if we're incentivized to to voluntarily
[32:13] forego purchasing today for future
[32:16] benefit because we believe there's more
[32:18] benefit in the future by not
[32:21] spending we're basically making the the
[32:25] decision that we don't want to fuel the
[32:28] debt based system that we currently have
[32:30] if that makes sense yeah it's it is for
[32:34] for me it's also like that when when
[32:36] when you have a Bitcoin as as as your
[32:38] choice it's it's it's like it's even
[32:41] like a wot it's like I I I want that
[32:45] system and it's a way more powerful vote
[32:48] and way more powerful step to take than
[32:51] just like once every five years you go
[32:54] to an small house and you write a name
[32:58] on that list and you try to hope for for
[33:00] change uh but voting every day with
[33:03] Bitcoin uh and that's which brings me
[33:06] now to El Salvador which is really
[33:07] interesting for me to to see a country
[33:11] where this game theory is playing out
[33:13] now where we started to have a country
[33:17] which is bullish on bitcoin the only
[33:20] thing and this is why I thought about
[33:22] that only thing uh as you said even when
[33:25] politicians do something it's temp it's
[33:27] usually temporary because uh they get
[33:31] out of B they get out of uh the office
[33:34] uh or they they don't want to do or they
[33:37] come even on a bad path like there can a
[33:39] lot of things happen that corrupt a
[33:42] politician how how long term like do do
[33:44] you think this El salv thing is is set
[33:47] in a really solid Direction now where
[33:49] it's like it's it's pretty sure that
[33:52] they will end up in a in a good uh
[33:55] situation um it's it's like a for for me
[33:58] it's like almost too good to be true
[34:01] story till now it's
[34:03] like they really did a lot of things on
[34:05] a lot of different levels uh even
[34:07] outside of Bitcoin with the gangs and
[34:09] with the passports and everything so you
[34:12] know I think it it shows how important
[34:15] people are so you got one man who's
[34:19] basically in charge there I mean he has
[34:21] a lot of power within that country and
[34:25] people seem to be very comfortable
[34:26] vesting that power in in his office and
[34:29] and to be happy with the decision that
[34:31] he's making within that
[34:33] role I I think this is kind of an
[34:36] experiment and with the results that
[34:38] they're having I think I don't think
[34:39] this is the last time we'll see this
[34:42] experiment um I mean you got Maya
[34:45] wanting to change things around in seram
[34:48] you got B and M uh hanging out last week
[34:52] I mean probably no reason right did just
[34:55] having coffee
[34:58] just chilling you know talking about
[35:00] soccer or football or whatever you want
[35:02] to call it um no I
[35:06] mean these are really smart guys who I
[35:09] think they want to do some positive
[35:11] things for the world and they know what
[35:13] Bitcoin is and this is they're going to
[35:16] be a part of it and I think that they're
[35:19] trying to approach this in a healthy way
[35:22] because you know like haak said you
[35:25] gotta have this has got to be kind of
[35:27] introduced in a Sly roundabout way to
[35:29] some degree I mean El Salvador has
[35:33] Bitcoin as legal tender but their
[35:35] National currency is US dollars so they
[35:39] are still operating within that system
[35:42] but be's coming out and saying look guys
[35:45] the Federal Reserve is scamming you you
[35:48] know he's talking about it you know at
[35:50] CPAC and on Tucker Carlson hey the
[35:54] Federal Reserve is not federal and
[35:56] there's no Reserves
[35:59] so you know make sense out of that
[36:02] however you
[36:03] will it's uh I love it a lot what's
[36:07] going on with n buuk and he's I think
[36:10] he's he's even underrated he's such a
[36:13] he's such an intelligent guy and and
[36:15] he's really thoughtful with what he's
[36:17] doing and um I'm curious to see what
[36:21] what's happening I'm planning on going
[36:24] in this November to finally go down
[36:26] myself uh I invited so many guests
[36:29] already from Salvador on my podcast
[36:31] talked with so many people they all said
[36:33] I should come at I think I should
[36:35] definitely come this year if it if I can
[36:37] make it uh but will be really great to
[36:40] see this um Bitcoin count also important
[36:45] that it's not a a crypto country that
[36:48] like that kind of set the stage really
[36:51] early on with like no it's it's it's
[36:52] Bitcoin and not not crypto did you had
[36:55] some uh some experiment station with
[36:58] with a crypto when you came into
[37:00] Bitcoin no I the thing is I'm very risk
[37:05] averse I I tend to not want to put money
[37:08] into anything that I think could go down
[37:11] like I'll give you an example I I sold
[37:15] my company in September of
[37:19] 2021 and I
[37:22] took 10% of that immediately uh put it
[37:25] in a money market account and I said
[37:27] said I want to go 7030 conservative I I
[37:31] don't what I just want this money to not
[37:34] go down I don't want to lose money here
[37:37] you know this is a lot this is
[37:38] everything I've worked
[37:40] for I just want this to be
[37:42] safe the bond 70% bonds 30% equities
[37:47] went down 11% in three months dude and
[37:51] I'm like if this if this is my downside
[37:55] with no upside I'm might as well just be
[37:58] throwing this uh 100% into equities or
[38:01] something else so I shut that down and
[38:04] I'm like I need to figure out how to not
[38:06] lose my money and that's
[38:08] when
[38:10] about six months later I became a
[38:13] Bitcoin maximalist after really looking
[38:15] into this it's like it was really a
[38:18] matter of self-preservation that led me
[38:20] to finally totally figure it out is is
[38:23] is um Bitcoin maximalism does this mean
[38:27] more to you outside of just being
[38:31] financially focused on bitcoin is it is
[38:34] the I often feel like it's even a
[38:37] philosophy a way of life yeah it is I
[38:41] mean I really love the forced
[38:46] austerity and if if you don't know what
[38:48] that means basically Bitcoin motivates
[38:51] you to not spend money
[38:55] frivolously and you know building a
[38:59] multi-million dollar company having a
[39:01] multiple seven figure exit
[39:04] you tend to be a little bit more
[39:07] Carefree especially if you've worked
[39:08] really hard and have been saving and
[39:10] didn't have money and then all of a
[39:12] sudden you come into a large amount of
[39:15] resources it can it can mess you up and
[39:18] honestly I wasn't totally prepared for
[39:20] that Dynamic one thing I love about
[39:22] Bitcoin is it it's incentivized
[39:26] discipline so you are financially
[39:29] incentivized to to make disciplined
[39:31] choices with your money um investing in
[39:34] general is like that but Bitcoin is so
[39:37] much more
[39:38] clear
[39:40] because of the rate of return if you're
[39:43] imagining putting your money in the
[39:45] stock market okay I I might lose out on
[39:47] a 10% gain this year if I spend this
[39:51] money rather than investing
[39:53] it most people are kind of like well I
[39:57] know adds up over time but I'll make it
[39:59] up it it doesn't matter um most
[40:02] investors are people who are putting
[40:04] their extra money or retirement money
[40:07] they can't touch anyways into an index
[40:09] fund for people
[40:12] who understand Bitcoins going up 100% a
[40:15] year you know anytime you're choosing to
[40:19] spend money on something you're like am
[40:21] I comfortable spending twice as much on
[40:23] this or am I comfortable spending three
[40:26] times as much as the as today's price
[40:29] because that's the opportunity that I'm
[40:32] choosing to forego I'm shorting Bitcoin
[40:35] if I'm if I'm consuming uh my resources
[40:39] it's I made a a tweet yesterday with
[40:42] with my new studio and I was writing
[40:45] sorry guys I'm short
[40:47] Bitcoin someone actually thought I'm not
[40:50] joking he's like I think you should
[40:52] invest in
[40:54] Bitcoin but yeah I mean we we have to
[40:57] draw our line our line somewhere and you
[41:00] know we need we don't really want
[41:02] Bitcoin we want the things Bitcoin will
[41:04] get us and we think Bitcoin will get us
[41:08] 10 times more in the future that's what
[41:10] that's what it is as you're building
[41:11] companies and you are also like involved
[41:13] in in in were involved in companies
[41:16] building them up um with your insights
[41:20] why why do you think that not more
[41:24] companies already copied micro salers
[41:27] strategy there are companies coming up
[41:30] and we had I think last week the news
[41:33] with uh Sal the I forgot the name but it
[41:37] was uh it was in a new scientific
[41:40] something um why why don't more
[41:43] companies just copied that strategy what
[41:46] what is holding companies back to put uh
[41:49] Bitcoin like maybe even like 5% it
[41:52] doesn't have to be like 100% all in like
[41:54] M it's not about a percentage I location
[41:57] at this point it's just very
[41:59] inconvenient um I would say that the
[42:04] hurdles you you'd have to be in a
[42:07] Michael Michael sailor position
[42:08] basically to accomplish what he did
[42:10] which is more than 50% of the voting
[42:13] rights in the company or a couple really
[42:16] strong allies and then you have to
[42:20] understand it to the degree where you're
[42:23] willing to put hundreds of millions or
[42:26] billions of dollars on the line and risk
[42:29] your career your life your
[42:33] reputation uh in a way where you may not
[42:36] even be rewarded uh individually for the
[42:39] upside so if you're putting a company's
[42:42] resources on the line you don't stand to
[42:45] necessarily benefit personally from that
[42:48] if that makes sense
[42:50] so for a resource allocator like uh Tim
[42:56] Cook
[42:58] if he puts Bitcoin on the balance sheet
[43:00] let's say he bought $10 billion wor a
[43:03] Bitcoin the price spikes the Apple stock
[43:06] does well and he gets some Financial
[43:10] benefit from that but the risk in his
[43:12] mind may be that if this goes
[43:16] poorly I look very foolish because this
[43:19] is so early you know what I mean so it's
[43:21] the reput reputational risk along with
[43:25] the lack of
[43:27] received personal uh short-term upside I
[43:29] think is what really keeps most
[43:32] companies from participating and the
[43:34] accounting rules
[43:36] so they've been treat they have a very
[43:39] poor treatment in the US until now for
[43:43] Bitcoin as an asset um it's an it's an
[43:46] impaired asset meaning you can only
[43:49] write it down when it goes down and you
[43:51] have to write it at its lowest value
[43:53] under your ownership but when it goes
[43:55] back up you can't realized that
[43:58] appreciation they changed the fby
[44:01] accounting
[44:02] rules uh or they changed it to fby
[44:05] accounting rules where now you can Mark
[44:08] to Market your Bitcoin as of 2024 I
[44:11] don't know if it's current or by end of
[44:13] year sailor was talking about it
[44:15] recently um that's a game changer and
[44:19] that's why you see there are there are
[44:21] companies that are starting to put put
[44:23] it on their balance sheet and it's
[44:24] because of the accounting rules so it's
[44:27] just like we're
[44:30] early we're just early man we're just
[44:32] early that's all it
[44:34] is it's it all it all comes down always
[44:38] always to that because uh if Bitcoin
[44:40] would be more mature already like five
[44:44] five years down the road uh then it
[44:46] would not be an reputational risk for
[44:49] the CEO to put Bitcoin on the balance
[44:52] sheet it would be just a reputational
[44:54] risk if he does not put Bitcoin on on
[44:57] the balance sheet because everybody all
[45:00] all of the sudden does it and he looks
[45:02] foolish if he not does it and he has to
[45:04] explain himself when he not puts put
[45:07] puts Bitcoin on on the balance sheet
[45:09] yeah it it's gonna flip at some point so
[45:12] it's we're we're probably like it's like
[45:14] a meter it's like this and it's gonna
[45:16] eventually be you're taking the opposite
[45:20] risk if you don't participate
[45:23] and it's not really a matter of if it's
[45:26] a matter matter of when because this is
[45:28] already happening like we can see it
[45:30] happening in real time so it's more
[45:33] about where are we where is that meter
[45:36] at and when is it gonna flip that's kind
[45:38] of that's really the question at this
[45:40] point from my from my vantage point I
[45:43] love it and uh on that note um as as
[45:48] money is extremely essential for for
[45:50] businesses to operate and and and do
[45:52] stuff uh and Bitcoin is kind of just ch
[45:57] changing how money works and replacing
[45:59] the The Current financial system if we
[46:01] play that far to the end um how how
[46:05] different will be the business world or
[46:08] will it even be B uh different uh when
[46:10] we look at how startups grow how uh big
[46:14] global companies work uh I I heard I
[46:18] think yesterday or a day before
[46:19] yesterday had an interview uh who said
[46:22] uh bit uh Bitcoin and sound money uh
[46:25] forces the economy need to be a little
[46:27] bit more regionalized localized and a
[46:30] little bit more decentralized uh he does
[46:32] not think that this big Global uh
[46:36] companies will be uh able to scale in
[46:39] the same way he sees it a little bit
[46:42] more as more decentralized um what are
[46:45] your thoughts on on on what Bitcoin
[46:48] standard does for
[46:50] businesses yeah I don't I don't know
[46:52] that I would totally agree with that I
[46:54] would say I would look at it more like
[46:55] this big bit
[46:57] coin forces you to become a master
[47:01] resource
[47:03] allocator because if you can't do that
[47:06] you should just own
[47:08] Bitcoin like if you have something that
[47:11] has a track record of going up 50 100
[47:14] 150% a year just holding on to it and
[47:18] doing nothing it raises the bar to you
[47:22] have that's your hurdle rate now your
[47:25] Bitcoin is now your hurdle rate as a
[47:28] business investor if this opportunity
[47:32] doesn't have more than a 50% chance of
[47:36] 100% annual return you're probably
[47:40] misallocating your resources so I think
[47:43] the second and third order effect of
[47:45] that is only the very most
[47:49] valuable business ideas receive
[47:53] investment in in in a Bitcoin standard
[47:57] everything else all this crap that
[47:59] nobody cares about that works because
[48:03] money was borrowed at 3% interest or 2%
[48:08] interest these things don't add they're
[48:11] not a good allocation of resources and
[48:15] they go away when money is properly
[48:19] valued yeah it's it's even in even in my
[48:22] personal life I'm I'm way more careful
[48:26] and thinking like really like does this
[48:28] thing add value to my life it was really
[48:31] easy with my podcast setup because I
[48:33] want to have high quality videos and I
[48:35] want to put out good Bitcoin content um
[48:39] but other things I'm really quick to uh
[48:43] just change and and do like I I can do
[48:45] it maybe other way and the thing that
[48:47] you said Also earlier with like can I
[48:52] would I buy this thing if it would be
[48:55] 10x the price or 5x surprise or whatever
[48:58] the the x is because this literally can
[49:01] happen this year to
[49:03] bitcoin uh I I don't think it will go
[49:05] that crazy this year because all you got
[49:09] to do is double it because that's your
[49:11] that's kind of what's been happening on
[49:12] the average double
[49:15] triple if you can double it and the and
[49:18] the and you can't justify the price then
[49:22] skip it only buy things that you also
[49:25] would buy
[49:27] when it was double the price and you
[49:29] actually value like it it makes you
[49:32] value things more like it makes you
[49:34] think before you before you spend this
[49:36] this low time preferencing it it makes
[49:38] you value your economic energy
[49:41] properly it's it's a miror it's that
[49:43] mirror concept it's just taking your
[49:47] resources and saying it is it worth
[49:52] putting my the the future value of my
[49:55] economic energy
[49:57] into this thing I want right now and if
[49:59] you believe that your the economic value
[50:01] that you've already created till now
[50:04] will be 10 100 times more valuable in
[50:08] the future you need to you need to uh
[50:12] protect it at all
[50:14] cost if that makes sense did something
[50:18] for for you change in your personal or
[50:21] professional life when you adopt a
[50:23] Bitcoin or where you're already kind of
[50:25] in this mindset you know I was raised
[50:29] very very risk averse
[50:32] uh if you're familiar with Dave Ramy my
[50:35] dad always thought you know don't ever
[50:38] have any debt of any kind I kind of
[50:40] bought that to some degree and I think
[50:44] it's a generally a wise approach not
[50:47] that borrowing money is inherently
[50:50] negative but you're adding risk and
[50:55] you're adding res resources that you
[50:57] didn't already earn so you're you're
[51:00] you're laid with the responsibility of
[51:02] allocating resources that that you
[51:05] didn't actually uh already provide the
[51:08] value to have in your possession so it's
[51:14] I think it's a a bad idea for young
[51:17] entrepreneurs to borrow money for an
[51:19] idea as an as an extreme example like a
[51:23] publicly traded company that's burning
[51:25] millions in cash every month that has no
[51:27] path to
[51:29] profitability you can you can apply that
[51:31] on an individual basis and come up with
[51:34] a a reasonable assessment of it uh
[51:39] before we get uh to the end routine uh
[51:41] I'm I'm kind of introducing that new
[51:44] question before the endro because I want
[51:46] to get to know what the bitcoiners are
[51:49] passionate about besides Bitcoin itself
[51:52] uh so the question for you what are you
[51:54] currently learning about what are you
[51:56] currently doing uh um or what are you
[51:59] currently passionate about besides
[52:01] Bitcoin is there anything that stands
[52:03] out to you I I think that there's some
[52:06] overlap into Bitcoin with with a lot of
[52:08] different things that I'm interested in
[52:11] um I'll just use this as an example uh
[52:15] just this week I've been getting uh so I
[52:20] have
[52:22] a an elementary school that we founded
[52:25] in 2019 in Uganda
[52:28] and my director there is an amazing guy
[52:32] uh we've got like almost 300 students uh
[52:36] like 90 kids are uh in distress families
[52:39] or orphans that you know we have them
[52:41] coming tuition free it's it's really
[52:44] uplifting the the community in in
[52:46] amazing way we put the only well in for
[52:48] like 10 miles so everybody comes every
[52:50] day for water to the school but so that
[52:54] the school in the education is is a part
[52:57] of the answer to the question that
[52:58] you're asking but how Bitcoin fits in is
[53:03] every time I would wire money to the
[53:05] director of my
[53:07] school they're taking a $40 fee and
[53:11] they're taking the the bank in Uganda is
[53:15] taking a 12%
[53:16] cut so
[53:19] 12%
[53:21] 12% so we're getting hammered on both
[53:25] sides we just did our first Bitcoin
[53:27] transactions this week because it it
[53:30] it's been difficult to get him on board
[53:32] because they had some really bad scams a
[53:34] couple years ago in Uganda and like the
[53:37] government's against it so I was you
[53:40] know I've been explaining like circular
[53:41] economy Concepts uh and like
[53:44] peer-to-peer and we figured out that he
[53:47] can do uh tether to local currency and
[53:51] we can we can work around it uh our last
[53:55] uh transaction cost like
[53:58] a130 uh to get him the same amount of
[54:00] money we would have lost 70 8090
[54:05] before yeah that's kind of the only
[54:09] thing also that makes sense outside of
[54:11] of Bitcoin with with the stable coins if
[54:13] you want to move money
[54:15] across uh and and and don't use the
[54:21] existing uh some fro
[54:24] cutting uh in financial institution
[54:26] where you get massive cut like 12% is
[54:29] just like the how do they justify such a
[54:33] big cut because there's no other choice
[54:37] I mean they they have a monopoly that's
[54:39] a monopoly interest rate if you think
[54:41] about it um so I I guess my passion
[54:45] right now largely boils down to learning
[54:48] and teaching like
[54:51] taking uh
[54:53] complicated Concepts and trying to
[54:56] understand them wrap my brain around
[54:58] them I'm not naturally gifted at that
[55:00] it's something that I have a passion for
[55:03] but it takes me a lot of time to
[55:06] understand things on a deep level but
[55:08] then once I have it I feel like I have
[55:11] something that I can make easier for the
[55:14] next person to understand so uh learning
[55:18] the hardest things I'm capable to learn
[55:20] and then trying to distill that into
[55:23] something maybe more attainable for some
[55:26] some who doesn't have the time or the
[55:27] energy to to put into it I guess was how
[55:31] is how I would try to say it and that's
[55:34] a it's amazing thing uh to do um we
[55:37] already got the tinam today uh so I
[55:41] would just uh end with like when people
[55:44] would like to get reach out to you want
[55:47] to ask you questions where can they find
[55:50] you where can uh people ask you
[55:52] questions um I
[55:54] mean I'm on Twitter
[55:56] I uh I usually check check on there few
[55:59] times a day so uh let me just confirm my
[56:03] Twitter handle I can I can give it to
[56:05] you and that you can put it in the bio
[56:06] if you want I have in in description
