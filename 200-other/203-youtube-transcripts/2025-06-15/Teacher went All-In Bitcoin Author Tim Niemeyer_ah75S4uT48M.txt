[00:00] oh shoot all of this printing is causing
[00:02] more problems that's when I really
[00:03] started to shift away from everything
[00:05] else start selling everything off and
[00:07] then focus on bitcoin only you know I
[00:09] learned my lessons the hard way what's
[00:11] your most controversial Bitcoin take man
[00:13] you stump me on that
[00:15] one my first question is usually why
[00:18] Bitcoin but you my first auor that
[00:21] actually wrote a Bitcoin book on the
[00:24] podcast so I want to start the question
[00:26] uh today what inspired you to write a
[00:29] book about Bitcoin it's a great question
[00:32] um I I got into Bitcoin in 2018 and uh
[00:35] from 2018 to 2020 2021 you know I I was
[00:40] like I was content kind of a
[00:42] posting on Twitter on X um I started
[00:45] writing a few articles for Bitcoin
[00:46] magazine the more I started to
[00:48] understand it but I really didn't have a
[00:49] desire to be an author per se uh until I
[00:52] had the idea for the book um history EO
[00:56] Bitcoin and once I had that idea that
[00:59] all of these different properties are
[01:01] coming together in one single protocol
[01:04] that the world has been kind of Yearning
[01:06] throughout history for these different
[01:08] properties that Bitcoin expresses um
[01:11] once I had that kind of realization it
[01:13] almost forced itself uh I was kind of
[01:17] compelled to to write it at that point
[01:20] maybe quickly Summarize the book for the
[01:23] people who don't know what it is or did
[01:26] not read it by now like what is it about
[01:29] so history e Bitcoin is uh it was an
[01:32] attempt to reach uh normies for lack of
[01:35] a better word uh in a non-technical way
[01:39] not so much what is bitcoin but more of
[01:42] why Bitcoin and really to zoom out from
[01:45] a historical perspective you know what
[01:47] I'm saying uh to see that the different
[01:51] properties permissionless uh
[01:52] decentralization censorship resistance
[01:55] all of these different properties that
[01:56] it
[01:57] expresses each one has been
[02:00] important throughout history humans have
[02:02] been wanting to have a system where they
[02:04] don't have to always ask permission they
[02:06] don't want to be censored you know um so
[02:10] what I did is take five episodes from
[02:12] History either examples or non-examples
[02:14] for each of those
[02:16] properties uh for each for each chapter
[02:19] and then um I rarely talk about Bitcoin
[02:22] I'll sprinkle some Bitcoin in throughout
[02:24] uh but not until the end so that the
[02:29] reader will kind of see that oh
[02:31] permissionless that's valuable
[02:33] throughout history um decentralization
[02:35] has been valuable throughout so that
[02:37] when you get to the end you see this
[02:38] kind of like Arc of History all of these
[02:40] different properties kind of coming
[02:42] together in this one simple
[02:44] protocol so if the reader agrees with me
[02:48] that each of those have been valuable
[02:50] throughout history then once you get to
[02:52] the end it's kind of an easy sell
[02:54] Bitcoin may not fix this but Bitcoin
[02:57] incentivizes this it makes all those
[02:58] properties come to life
[03:00] it gives people what they've been
[03:01] yearning yearning for throughout history
[03:04] yeah this is also what I really liked
[03:05] about the Bitcoin standard itself uh the
[03:08] book from sa moose because it's not a
[03:11] super technical uh book where like I
[03:14] think the first uh half of the book it
[03:17] doesn't even mention Bitcoin a lot like
[03:20] it's just about the history of money and
[03:21] why it's important and I love those
[03:24] books because you can give those books
[03:27] to people who are not in the Bitcoin
[03:29] bubble
[03:30] and and the same thing yeah jef poof
[03:34] right yeah he rarely he talked about it
[03:36] the last chapter yeah and it's it's so
[03:39] important to to come outside of of our
[03:42] Bitcoin bubble also to like we we are
[03:46] having maybe sometimes like Echo
[03:49] chamber uh where we are talking to each
[03:51] other and making us each other feel good
[03:54] about Bitcoin and we have to break out
[03:56] more and more
[03:58] and there is a there is value to that
[04:01] being in that uh it's like um iron
[04:03] sharpens iron you know us bantering back
[04:06] and forth about waxing philosophical on
[04:08] bitcoin it helps each other um kind of
[04:11] focus our efforts but you're absolutely
[04:14] right we need to go outside of that uh
[04:17] we need to reach the normies reach the
[04:20] other 99% of the world that just doesn't
[04:23] know yet all the benefits of Bitcoin not
[04:26] just the number go up but the freedom go
[04:28] up yeah
[04:30] in your book you as you said you
[04:32] explored the relationship between the
[04:34] Bitcoin properties and historical events
[04:37] what would be the most important
[04:40] historical event and how does it reflect
[04:42] on on bitcoin see uh that's interesting
[04:46] because I didn't find one historical
[04:49] event that just really said oh this is
[04:51] it um as I was researching I was
[04:54] actually having a hard time taking
[04:56] episodes in history and finding Which
[04:57] chapter would it work best in um because
[05:02] a lot of them censorship resistance
[05:04] immutability they kind of overlap you
[05:06] know what I mean to me though uh to kind
[05:08] of sidestep your
[05:10] question it's this this the greatness of
[05:14] it is in the combination of them all all
[05:17] of the properties working together in
[05:19] concert is is The Sweet Spot
[05:23] because as you might have paid attention
[05:25] to or learned from the last so many
[05:28] years all of these other altcoins or
[05:30] anything else they might have one
[05:32] property or they'll say but this other
[05:34] thing is better and what we've learned
[05:37] hopefully we've learned is that it's not
[05:41] just about one or the other like trying
[05:42] to tweak the dial on one at the expense
[05:45] of others it's it's the mixture of all
[05:46] of these together that really um give it
[05:49] its
[05:50] value so it was not uh that you had
[05:53] troubles finding events it was more like
[05:56] there were too many events you can uh
[05:58] compare bit properties too you know I I
[06:01] kind of you could consider it
[06:03] cherry-picking uh because yeah there
[06:05] were so many different events and I try
[06:08] to make it um a bite-size book like you
[06:11] were mentioning something accessible uh
[06:13] to a non- bitcoiner and I could have
[06:16] easily made it you know a home I could I
[06:19] could have added 10 episodes so I I had
[06:23] more I did more work on the um singling
[06:25] it down to just five per chapter and
[06:29] that's it's really important because we
[06:32] we sometimes have the tendency to make
[06:35] things bigger and larger and more
[06:37] complex also to to look more
[06:40] intelligence and stuff like that uh but
[06:42] the true beauty uh I come from software
[06:44] development and the be beauty also in
[06:47] software development comes from finding
[06:49] not a lot of lines of code so that's why
[06:52] it makes no sense to to to pay a
[06:56] software developer for the lines of
[06:58] codes he makes it's for the lines of
[07:00] codes he can delete like make it smaller
[07:03] make it more elegent make it should do
[07:05] the same thing but with less uh code
[07:09] sizes and I think um information should
[07:11] also be like that it should be only the
[07:14] the the information that is actually
[07:17] necessary and brings the point home with
[07:20] not missing out on anything and that's a
[07:22] really hard task it's it's interesting
[07:24] because you come from software I come
[07:26] from education I'm in my music classroom
[07:28] I teach uh pre pre kindergarten through
[07:31] fourth grade music right now and uh it's
[07:34] similar you know I have an audience
[07:37] that's attention span is like that you
[07:39] know what I mean um so when I'm talking
[07:43] to other bitcoiners I can elaborate I
[07:45] can go on I you know I can I can really
[07:48] dig in and have th and I love those deep
[07:50] philosophical conversations but in here
[07:53] I have to bring it down to the very bare
[07:56] minimum what is the essential element
[07:58] that I'm trying to
[08:00] convey and uh that I tried to approach
[08:03] that with the book the same way so the
[08:05] kids kindergarten elementary school so
[08:07] they're really young uh what is it like
[08:09] six years stuff like six up to 10ish
[08:13] yeah five to 11 depending yeah uh when
[08:17] you step in the kids shoes now and see
[08:20] the world maybe changing with Bitcoin in
[08:23] like when they are 50 when they are 40
[08:26] 50 60 years old how will Bitcoin
[08:29] change maybe their mindset even compared
[08:32] to people are that are now 50 years old
[08:35] like how has Bitcoin such an historical
[08:39] impact on on the world that uh it will
[08:43] be look differently from the perspective
[08:47] of them in 40 years I would like to hope
[08:53] that the benefit comes
[08:56] in from a shift in time preference
[09:00] um I do I I I do believe I'm sure you're
[09:04] in the camp that believes that the Fiat
[09:06] mindset leads to High Time preference
[09:09] 100% yeah so if bitcoiners are right I
[09:14] have no reason to believe or not in that
[09:17] time pref uh the the system that we're
[09:20] in
[09:21] incentivizes um our actions then a
[09:25] system that incentivizes low time
[09:27] preference would lead to people living a
[09:29] low time preference mindset and I that
[09:32] builds generational wealth that builds
[09:35] um it takes away um the need for
[09:38] immediacy and kneejerk
[09:40] reactions um and I see that kind of
[09:43] prevalent in society not just in society
[09:46] but also in my classroom obviously they
[09:47] kids but um hopefully they'll be able to
[09:52] have attached onto that idea of like
[09:54] understanding what is low time
[09:56] preference why is it valuable and start
[09:58] living that life
[10:01] and so you think that uh Bitcoin could
[10:04] be a historical event like you looked
[10:07] back at historical events and when
[10:10] offers and and researchers are looking
[10:12] in 50 to 100 years back on the uh in the
[10:16] history what happened in the last 100
[10:18] 200 years they also looking oh 2009 Z do
[10:21] Nakamoto the white paper uh what
[10:24] happened there um that that's an
[10:26] interesting thought that we uh become
[10:29] what we think it becomes we are living
[10:32] through a founding era of a new
[10:35] Financial Revolution and this is
[10:37] something I'm I'm I'm struggling to
[10:39] imagine that we are actually so uh uh
[10:43] blessed to be right now right here
[10:46] absolutely I agree 100 perc I look I
[10:48] kind of look forward to that in my
[10:50] Twilight you know you say 50 years from
[10:52] now I hope to be alive in 50 years from
[10:54] now I'd be 96 so yeah I'm G make it 100
[10:58] um I look forward to seeing that um
[11:01] that'll be my grandchildren right yeah
[11:04] so
[11:05] uh yeah that that is my hope low time
[11:08] preference I'm sure there's a ton of
[11:10] other ways we could take that but to me
[11:12] that that permeates all of
[11:14] society yeah low time preference is for
[11:17] for me also the the fundamental uh base
[11:20] layer what what drives in Bitcoin on
[11:24] mind like this is like the longer they
[11:27] are in Bitcoin uh I see the shift in
[11:30] their mindset I sh I see that they are a
[11:34] little bit more relaxed they a little
[11:36] bit more focused also they they're
[11:39] getting there's something happening in
[11:42] their minds for sure I just noticed that
[11:46] I I I can I mean I can see that also in
[11:49] others but I definitely saw it in myself
[11:52] um I've you know so I'm 46 maybe there's
[11:56] just a level of maturity from your 30s
[11:58] to your 40s to whatever I'm sure there
[12:00] is but there is a stark change once that
[12:03] once the orange pill really took hold in
[12:05] me and I I've I've personally been more
[12:08] focused
[12:10] um less worried about material things in
[12:14] life Le I anymore I don't even worry
[12:17] about not worry um I put less value on
[12:20] money in terms of like income or
[12:22] whatever and more value on my time I I
[12:26] value my time more so uh
[12:30] Ju Just in that one instance uh
[12:32] bitcoin's given me a completely
[12:34] different
[12:35] perspective so Bitcoin changed also you
[12:39] in your life did writing a Bitcoin book
[12:43] change your view about
[12:46] Bitcoin it helped me sharpen um sharpen
[12:49] my uh my message my view of Bitcoin it
[12:54] it's continuously evolving as I'm sure
[12:56] everybody's is um the more you the more
[12:58] you learn the more you want to learn the
[13:00] more you realize you don't know the more
[13:03] you learn you know I mean uh so um it's
[13:07] just made me more interested in
[13:09] understanding different aspects and
[13:10] different uh potential outcomes from the
[13:14] system next to the book you also
[13:17] recently started a YouTube channel uh
[13:19] think it was uh in November like it
[13:21] really really
[13:23] recently uh so what what made you do
[13:26] that uh making first the book that it's
[13:29] like a long uh thing you read it's like
[13:33] a a high entry High barrier of entry for
[13:37] people and now you're making YouTube
[13:39] shorts like that's the the other
[13:41] Spectrum I think of of of the attention
[13:45] span and the format of of of the the
[13:48] medium like what made you do the the
[13:51] whole whole
[13:52] Spectrum well uh when I wrote the book I
[13:56] was I was on the mindset that hey I'm
[13:59] going to try and do an introductory book
[14:02] and kind of make it accessible for the
[14:04] average person and I feel like I I
[14:07] accomplished that in in a way
[14:10] but I kind of kept on that path and I
[14:13] kind of jumped past a lot of steps but
[14:16] um I'm noticing like we discussed
[14:19] earlier with attention
[14:21] spans the majority of the population has
[14:23] a very short attention span um the
[14:26] majority of the
[14:27] population uh their reading level has
[14:31] declined over the past so many decades
[14:35] so in the book I did get a little um
[14:38] verbose a little wordy at times and
[14:41] that's just my natural style but I I
[14:44] told myself if what what is the goal the
[14:47] goal is to reach more people and if more
[14:49] people
[14:50] are not at that level or not at
[14:53] that ability to maintain attention then
[14:57] I need to meet them where they're at
[14:59] just like in my class you know I could
[15:01] talk I'd love to just sit and uh jam on
[15:03] Jazz Theory but elementary kids aren't
[15:06] going to get it right so I got to come
[15:07] down to their level so um I'm trying to
[15:11] reach the people where they're at with
[15:13] the YouTube shorts that it's zoom out 21
[15:16] uh like you said shorts they're a minute
[15:19] long and you have in in trying to make
[15:23] some make one small concept of Bitcoin
[15:25] in a minute my my language had to get
[15:29] much simpler and it's it's helped me
[15:34] like I said before sharpen my axe um so
[15:37] when I goed up to somebody because like
[15:39] in the past somebody asked me about
[15:41] Bitcoin gosh I am going off about 21
[15:44] million I'm going off about uh the
[15:45] difficulty adjustment I'm going off
[15:47] about mining I'm going off on all these
[15:48] Austrian economics and I've already lost
[15:50] it and they're not interested
[15:52] anymore right so it's all about like I
[15:55] said meeting them where where they're at
[15:58] give in B size chunks is do you see a
[16:02] shortened attention span uh as a problem
[16:06] or is it just something natural to occur
[16:08] is it something that occurs because of
[16:10] the feared world is it because we have
[16:13] digitalization uh I'm sure there's a lot
[16:15] of factors but I think it comes back to
[16:17] that time preference it comes right back
[16:19] to time preference because if you're uh
[16:22] that rat on the wheel going faster and
[16:25] faster to get closer to the cheese you
[16:28] know you don't have time to stop and
[16:30] look at a read a long form book or
[16:32] listen to a long form podcast that's the
[16:35] um incentives of the Fiat mindset of the
[16:38] Fiat system playing itself out in
[16:40] society I
[16:42] believe sometimes I also think that um
[16:45] the short time span makes it easier to
[16:51] spread I say News to it because
[16:54] if you only read the headlines and more
[16:57] and more people read only headlines and
[16:59] not not try to
[17:02] critical understand topics they of
[17:06] course they think that Bitcoin eats a
[17:07] lot of energy of course people think
[17:09] that Bitcoin is volatile and does not is
[17:12] not a good currency for us because they
[17:14] only hear this those small sizes and
[17:17] they don't do the work and actually dive
[17:19] into that how can we like how will bit
[17:22] Bitcoin change that or can Bitcoin
[17:25] change
[17:27] that I mean the hope is yes um I mean
[17:32] it's kind of like
[17:34] U feeding someone a steak you don't
[17:38] shove the entire steak in their mouth
[17:39] you got to cut it down a bite size and
[17:41] after they have that taste they're like
[17:43] I want to come back for more so in that
[17:46] my thought is in in the YouTube
[17:49] channel that I do the shorts and then
[17:52] I'll also have a long form down the road
[17:55] to where I can you know link it um put a
[17:59] card on the end to where it's like if
[18:00] you're interested in learning more
[18:02] taking a deeper dive um but you talk
[18:06] about orange P we talk about orange
[18:07] pills it's like how big is the orange
[18:10] pill you know you want something that
[18:12] you're going to be able to swallow or
[18:14] like a Cano said take the orange pill
[18:16] now or the suppository later right so
[18:19] you wna give you want to give them a an
[18:24] small enough orange pill um to try and
[18:26] tie them in
[18:28] try and draw
[18:31] in if you see all the historical events
[18:34] uh how long will it be that fear is a
[18:37] historical
[18:39] event or will will it ever be um
[18:43] something that
[18:45] actually is a thing of the past I'm
[18:47] gonna butcher the phrase but what what's
[18:49] that phrase um like we over
[18:53] estimate we underestimate now we
[18:56] overestimate what we can do in a year
[18:57] and we underestimate what we can do in
[18:59] 10 years I think you would wanted to say
[19:01] exactly that's exactly right thank you
[19:04] um I mean I think that's the simple
[19:05] answer to that
[19:08] uh I I'd like to think that actually no
[19:12] um I've kind of got I've kind of
[19:13] Switched on that you know as a bitcoiner
[19:16] looking forward to hyperbitcoinization
[19:17] you know is it going to be in one five
[19:20] 10 years or something like that but if
[19:23] you think about trading and if you look
[19:25] at charts if you see a huge run up in
[19:28] price that's usually followed by a huge
[19:30] retracement right a crash um versus a
[19:34] chart that goes up forms a base goes up
[19:37] forms a base those that's more
[19:38] sustainable over time so as much as I'm
[19:42] yearning for hyperbitcoinization
[19:44] sooner than later I think it's better
[19:47] societally for that slow
[19:50] build uh so we have
[19:53] less heartache for lack of a better word
[19:57] uh throughout Society so if it takes 50
[20:00] years it takes 50 years if it takes a
[20:03] 100 I mean we may not see it but if
[20:05] we're laying the groundwork if we're
[20:07] planting the seed and we're not going to
[20:09] see the tree fully grown I mean I I got
[20:11] to be okay with that I'm okay with
[20:16] that there's a interesting question
[20:18] coming up in my mind what what is
[20:21] bitcoin success look like does Fiat has
[20:23] to fail in order for Bitcoin to be a
[20:27] complete success
[20:29] that's a good question um I just made a
[20:31] video
[20:32] that kind of went along with with that
[20:35] um I don't think it has to it's like my
[20:39] question was how how can you kill
[20:42] Bitcoin and it was and and it was more
[20:44] of a joke that you can't it's like take
[20:46] the dollar make it a stable currency
[20:50] make it so a few can't control you know
[20:52] the supply you know take off all the
[20:54] permissions and all that and it's like
[20:56] oh wait you end up with Bitcoin um
[21:00] you know all go through all of those
[21:01] steps but
[21:03] um the thing is if it changes if Bitcoin
[21:06] ends up changing the behavior of Fiat
[21:09] like maybe it gets to the point
[21:11] where the people that control Fiat
[21:14] realized oh shoot all of this printing
[21:17] is causing more problems and causing us
[21:19] to lose market share or
[21:21] whatever maybe we need to change you
[21:24] know bitco Bitcoin is not going to
[21:25] change Bitcoin doesn't care right it's
[21:27] going to keep doing what doing so it's a
[21:29] forcing function on the other systems
[21:32] and since the other systems are
[21:33] controlled by humans that are
[21:35] fallible most likely they're going to be
[21:37] the ones that have to adapt interesting
[21:41] did you experience with uh other stuff
[21:43] than Bitcoin with altcoins uh with uh
[21:48] and are you now Bitcoin only yes no um I
[21:53] I got I I went through the blockfi
[21:56] thing um
[21:58] early on I was like even like 2020 I was
[22:03] in my mind all about decentralization
[22:05] and at the I hadn't really researched
[22:07] deeply enough so I was also in the
[22:08] ethereum I was I even like set up my own
[22:12] uh staking node and all that and it took
[22:15] forever to unstake um and sell and
[22:18] convert but I'm finally past that
[22:21] um but yes I I did that from 2018
[22:25] through 20 almost 2021 at 20 in in the
[22:29] year 2020 when we had the big
[22:31] crash that's when I really started to
[22:33] shift away from everything else started
[22:36] selling everything off and then focus on
[22:38] bitcoin only but you know I learned my
[22:40] lessons the hard way luckily I learned
[22:44] them earlier than later luckily I
[22:47] learned them at all you know what I mean
[22:49] but yes I'm Bitcoin only now why Bitcoin
[22:54] only from the things we talked about
[22:56] earlier I mean it it can't be
[22:59] manipulated it can't be
[23:01] controlled it it is what it is
[23:05] um it's the only thing that's
[23:07] decentralized actually you mean that's
[23:10] sufficiently decentralized it's it's a
[23:13] beacon of Truth um literally everything
[23:15] else ethereum or cbdcs or stable coins
[23:19] or whatever they're just a digital
[23:21] Recreation of the current
[23:23] system yeah throw nfts in there you know
[23:26] there's just like a lot of online Gam
[23:28] Ling it's just a digital form of
[23:30] gambling
[23:31] and Bitcoin represents the truth whereas
[23:35] everything else is just a fact simile a
[23:39] digital representation it's also funny
[23:41] to me because uh people try to do video
[23:45] games on some decentralized currencies
[23:48] and it's an really inefficient way to
[23:52] store data at blockchain like blockchain
[23:54] has for me no reason to exist other than
[23:59] Bitcoin I just had somebody tell me that
[24:01] yesterday on a call you know I'm talk
[24:04] I'm getting a lot more calls now that
[24:05] the price is going up like what and he's
[24:08] like yeah I love this Bitcoin idea so I
[24:10] want to diversify into blockchain and I
[24:13] I said exactly what you just said it it
[24:16] doesn't serve any purpose it's actually
[24:18] inefficient why have a blockchain when
[24:20] you can have some database or an Excel
[24:23] shared Excel spreadsheet right yeah it's
[24:25] a complete red flag for me now is when
[24:28] someone says oh I'm not that excited
[24:30] about Bitcoin but blockchain I'm really
[24:32] interested in I'm like what is one
[24:36] application next to bitcoin and it's
[24:39] it's also always F fascinating I don't
[24:42] know if you ever tried it if someone
[24:44] comes up to you like in real life and
[24:46] relative to you or something like that
[24:49] and they tell no I'm really interested
[24:50] in blockchain but not about Bitcoin and
[24:53] then you ask him okay uh besides from
[24:55] Bitcoin is there any use case or what
[24:58] use cases are there for a blockchain and
[25:00] then they have usually one or two
[25:02] examples I usually have uh 30 seconds to
[25:07] 50 seconds explanation why this does not
[25:10] make sense and I'm blessed that I'm also
[25:13] softer developer so I can uh explain it
[25:16] also on a technical level uh and then
[25:19] they're like oh interesting because most
[25:22] people like blockchain it's it's similar
[25:24] than all the other bws and they doesn't
[25:27] they don't make sense for everything and
[25:31] they're just throwing it around and they
[25:33] if you dig deeper like most people have
[25:35] have no clue about what blockchain
[25:37] actually is and uh that it only makes
[25:41] sense for for Bitcoin at least for in my
[25:44] sense and a lot of times what they know
[25:47] about blockchain is the same thing they
[25:49] know about Bitcoin which is a chart
[25:52] they're looking at a chart and they
[25:53] think oh maybe it's like a higher low or
[25:55] o it had it's retraced so much so now
[25:57] it's a a value buy you know it's
[25:59] something like that without actually
[26:01] knowing what it is like you just said um
[26:04] I find that a lot of times that most
[26:06] people's understanding of Bitcoin or
[26:08] interest in Bitcoin is purely um
[26:12] directly related to the
[26:14] price I mean I mean to be I mean to be
[26:18] fair they don't hear anything else
[26:20] because if you see mainstream media uh
[26:23] they either report on some fat like the
[26:28] the pool and just the water pools and
[26:30] the transaction thing there there's some
[26:33] great things out there but other than
[26:36] that it's usually oh Bitcoin went up 2x
[26:38] oh Bitcoin crashed 60% and this is what
[26:41] people read in the mainstream media and
[26:43] of course this is only the the only
[26:45] thing they got in your in the head well
[26:48] and it goes back to the whole High Time
[26:50] preference kind of idea when you look at
[26:52] uh whatever news station you see the
[26:54] ticker go across the bottom right it it
[26:57] it it's not it's the price but it's not
[27:01] like oh this person in this
[27:03] authoritarian regime is now free from
[27:06] control because you know they're not
[27:07] gonna write they're not gonna write that
[27:09] in the ticker as it goes across they're
[27:10] just gonna put the price and that's what
[27:12] people see so because they only have
[27:14] that Split Second to kind of grab their
[27:16] attention but that that would be amazing
[27:18] if
[27:21] this bit freed those many people in that
[27:25] country because they're no longer object
[27:29] to that would save this many uh you know
[27:33] this many people from a cold winter you
[27:36] know this could actually be
[27:39] an more more of a story that Bitcoin
[27:42] miners help uh balance the power grid uh
[27:45] because they can turn it off and on and
[27:47] then like work with the governments to
[27:51] like okay there we have a peak we
[27:53] settling down our Bitcoin miners for 80%
[27:56] but we get credits for that uh I think
[27:59] this those news will come out more and
[28:02] more will be interesting to see what
[28:05] like maybe another question I don't know
[28:07] if if you have an opinion on that but it
[28:09] just came to my mind um why is most of
[28:13] the media designed like it this design
[28:16] uh most mainstream media when you click
[28:19] through it and I don't do it anymore so
[28:22] I don't think it has changed but uh but
[28:25] why is it uh this signed like that or is
[28:29] it like that I think it's um I mean not
[28:32] to get
[28:34] too you know I'll just say it it just
[28:37] seems like that they're all
[28:40] um suckling from the power te if you if
[28:44] you will you know what I mean um and
[28:47] it's not so much an intellectual
[28:50] conversation as these people are paying
[28:54] me or this advertisement or you know
[28:57] this Co Corporation is saying this so
[29:00] therefore um if I want to
[29:03] be uh powerful or if I want to have fame
[29:07] or whatever I'm going to say what
[29:09] they're saying and it's it's not so
[29:12] um what's the word I'm looking
[29:16] for it's it's not so much intellectual
[29:19] honesty it's it's just kind of going
[29:22] with the flow virtue signaling of sorts
[29:25] right you now what's 46 years old you
[29:29] said yes sir uh so our feat system when
[29:33] we take 1971 is what
[29:37] 52 years old now so you uh almost Liv
[29:41] through the whole uh field cycle except
[29:45] the first what like five to 10 years
[29:48] yeah did did what did what uh changes do
[29:54] you saw in the last let's see
[29:58] 35 40 years because if they 46 with six
[30:02] years old you probably did not look that
[30:04] closely at the world but in the last 30
[30:07] to 45 years uh in media with the
[30:11] monetary system what was was happening
[30:14] uh changes wise you you think you know I
[30:18] it's funny because I growing up I did
[30:21] not have any interest as most young kids
[30:25] don't have interest interest in the
[30:27] financial system and if I met a teenager
[30:29] that was really interested I'd almost be
[30:31] like what's wrong with
[30:32] you um I only recently have been paying
[30:37] attention in the last five to 10 years
[30:39] like about I'd say about 10ish years ago
[30:42] I started learning more about investing
[30:44] and started learning more about like
[30:46] macroeconomics and only in the last five
[30:49] or so years about Bitcoin and that's
[30:52] that's when so everything before that
[30:55] was just embedded in me as normal
[30:57] like you said I didn't grow up in a
[30:59] different system i' I've grown up in
[31:00] this system my whole life so nobody pays
[31:03] attention to something that's just
[31:05] always been there you know it kind of
[31:07] goes out of your
[31:09] focus it's like people don't people
[31:11] don't see the nose on their face because
[31:13] they're not focusing on it because it's
[31:14] been there the whole time right yeah I
[31:17] and try and focus on it I don't know
[31:19] where I heard it uh I I cannot remember
[31:24] where I heard it there was this
[31:25] experiment with uh monkeys they were
[31:28] like in a cave and there were on a
[31:31] mountain there were some bananas up and
[31:33] they were going up and they can't grab
[31:35] the bananas and going down but then they
[31:38] started whenever they tried to go up
[31:40] there uh they just washing them down
[31:42] with uh water so they always had like a
[31:45] bad experience when they tried to go up
[31:48] there and the first tried it and the
[31:50] second tried it the third tried it and
[31:52] then they all settled down and said oh
[31:55] okay we're not going up there because
[31:57] every time we going up there we are
[31:58] getting uh squashed back by the water
[32:02] and then they start
[32:04] um changing out the monkeys like first
[32:07] one he tried it and got B pack and so on
[32:12] and so forth it got so weird that even
[32:15] the monkeys that were in there uh
[32:18] attacked the monkeys that tried to go up
[32:20] there because they tried to warn him and
[32:23] uh at the they made the experience so
[32:26] long
[32:28] till uh they did not have to wash them
[32:32] down anymore because the monkey hinder
[32:35] uh hindered them on going up and in the
[32:38] end there they changed all the monkeys
[32:42] and not one of the monkeys had actually
[32:44] a bad experience going up the mountain
[32:47] and getting the banana but nobody did it
[32:50] because they had it in their brain so
[32:52] they could actually just go up um but
[32:55] not one of the monkeys actually had the
[32:58] experience themselves and this goes back
[33:02] to what you said a little bit when you
[33:05] just in the system for a long time and
[33:08] you just uh are in there and field
[33:11] system is normal for you and like okay
[33:13] two till 10% inflation is actually maybe
[33:16] even a good thing uh you don't question
[33:18] that that much you're just like oh 2%
[33:22] inflation it's supposed to be a good
[33:23] thing if everybody tells you that a long
[33:26] time like you you take it as it is well
[33:30] that's that's interesting I'd love to I
[33:32] I I geek out on those kind of things so
[33:33] I'd love to see that study that kind of
[33:35] reminded me of a similar study with a
[33:37] different purpose but uh there's a video
[33:40] you can find on YouTube I'm
[33:42] sure where
[33:44] um they have people like dancing you
[33:47] know and everything and and the people
[33:49] and then the study was you know people
[33:52] just watch dancing and then afterwards
[33:53] they ask you like what did you see out
[33:55] of the ordinary
[33:57] and nobody saw anything out of the
[33:58] ordinary oh yeah but when you rewind it
[34:00] and go slow-mo in the back there's like
[34:02] a guy in a the monkey thing is what got
[34:04] it but the guy in the monkey suit
[34:05] bouncing like a red ball walking through
[34:07] this and the thing is to me that's more
[34:09] about like in addition to what you're
[34:11] saying it's also about the focus like
[34:13] you said on the news they're not
[34:15] focusing on this thing going on back
[34:17] here they're trying to uh distract you
[34:19] with all the information up here so
[34:21] whether it's purposeful or they're
[34:23] incentivized to do it I guess in this in
[34:26] this conversation Bitcoin is like that
[34:28] guy in the monkey suit in the back it's
[34:29] like he's there but nobody can see it
[34:32] because their their focus is somewhere
[34:35] else they're sitting here thinking
[34:37] everything is okay yeah that's 100% 100%
[34:41] true I I I don't know uh I saw it also I
[34:45] think a lot on on social media this
[34:47] experiment like uh first you you see the
[34:50] video and then in the last frame did you
[34:54] notice the giant big monkey and then you
[34:56] you go back and like oh the monkey
[34:59] was actually
[35:01] there uh yeah um coming back to the book
[35:06] what main takeaway like if the if the
[35:08] reader can only uh take one takeaway
[35:13] from the book what would it be like
[35:15] what's the main takeaway from uh they
[35:18] should take away from the
[35:21] book Bitcoin is not only historically
[35:26] relevant
[35:28] but it's a culmination
[35:30] of human Ingenuity working
[35:33] towards Solutions of a lot of different
[35:36] aspects all the different
[35:39] properties that's
[35:42] beautiful thank you I like
[35:45] it again trying to get it down to that
[35:47] bite-sized chunk right yeah that that's
[35:50] really good so you've done the book you
[35:54] are now with the YouTube channel active
[35:56] you're on active uh what's next for you
[35:59] personally you also have the elementary
[36:01] school so like you also jugle a lot of
[36:04] different things what's
[36:06] next we also uh I co-host lincolnland
[36:09] Bitcoin in Springfield Illinois so we
[36:12] have monthly meetings there um what is
[36:16] it Lincoln Lincoln Land so uh Abraham
[36:19] Lincoln historical figure is from from
[36:22] this area I actually used to live right
[36:25] down the road from New Salem where he
[36:27] grew up so uh a little nod to him um we
[36:32] have The Picture of Dorian Nakamoto with
[36:35] an AB Lincoln hat as our logo so love
[36:39] that uh but I do Lincoln Land Bitcoin
[36:42] also um I'm currently
[36:45] exploring a a career a side hustle if
[36:49] you will in Consulting because I do
[36:51] believe that as we continue there
[36:54] there's going to be a certain amount of
[36:56] the population that doesn't want a black
[36:59] rock Bitcoin you know they don't want
[37:01] the possibility of being rug pulled uh
[37:04] there's going to be people that want to
[37:05] be self- Sovereign still and they won't
[37:08] have the either the time or the
[37:10] expertise to really understand that I'm
[37:13] not trying to be a custodian or anything
[37:14] I don't want to provide any Financial
[37:16] advice because that's not my jam uh but
[37:19] I do want to get into start like
[37:21] suggesting well here's here's what you
[37:24] have maybe we should do a hardware
[37:25] wallet or maybe we should run node or
[37:27] you know kind of help walk them through
[37:29] that and help them set that up um
[37:32] there's a lot of Bitcoins I'm in a
[37:34] telegram group uh Bitcoin Consultants
[37:37] Network that we're having those
[37:39] conversations like what will that look
[37:40] like it was started by bendall I don't
[37:43] know if you're familiar with him so
[37:45] there's a a Bitcoin telegram group about
[37:49] uh Bitcoin Consultants uh trying to help
[37:52] people on board on bitcoin so absolutely
[37:55] absolutely so that that's there's going
[37:57] to be a need for that or that's what I
[37:58] believe and also working towards that
[38:01] there's definitely a need for that I
[38:04] recently spoke I think my second podcast
[38:06] guest it it was uh Tony from the Bitcoin
[38:12] way if you heard about them they're also
[38:14] doing uh some some similar thing and
[38:17] they recently were joined by Rick who
[38:21] lost 25
[38:23] Bitcoins uh the there uh this guy who
[38:27] lost 25 Bitcoin it was really all over X
[38:30] at least on my feet for like one two
[38:32] days and he uh got into self custody
[38:36] then got into the whole sphere and then
[38:40] uh the Bitcoin way helped him and uh he
[38:43] joined now the Bitcoin way because now
[38:46] because of that incident he got educated
[38:49] and he's one of the next guests uh I'm
[38:52] interviewing and this will be uh amazing
[38:55] because I want to make one one episode
[38:57] with like him I will do it uh where I
[39:00] can send people and say okay I
[39:03] interviewed this guy who lost 25 Bitcoin
[39:06] he will be joined by Tony also a
[39:09] consultant in the in the sphere with uh
[39:12] Bitcoin uh onboarding and there we can
[39:15] make a really nice uh um one hour two
[39:19] hours half an hour whatever it takes um
[39:23] episode what can you do in self custody
[39:26] what
[39:27] best for you I think there's still a
[39:29] need for individual
[39:32] service but it's also important that the
[39:34] information is just out there for free
[39:37] well and in that too um education is key
[39:41] because of all the fud most
[39:44] people they there is either no
[39:47] information that they have or this small
[39:49] information they have as we said before
[39:51] is wrong um I'm also working with a
[39:53] group um led by red tail hawk if you're
[39:56] familiar uh
[39:59] developing kind of like a
[40:02] um curriculum uh homeschool curriculum
[40:06] for Bitcoin and I've noticed there's a
[40:09] few of them out there but uh really
[40:10] trying to find a nice easy package for
[40:14] the
[40:15] homeschooler uh in Bitcoin education um
[40:20] that's going to I think there's there's
[40:22] going to be a need from that going
[40:23] forward I mean and I'm I'm speaking as a
[40:26] public educator you know what I mean um
[40:28] I I support homeschooling and uh what's
[40:31] your thoughts on on homeschooling
[40:33] because I think it's uh correlates a lot
[40:36] with Bitcoin like I see a lot of
[40:38] bitcoiners are a huge proponent of
[40:41] homeschooling and I think homeschooling
[40:44] is also a market that was grow is
[40:47] growing a lot especially since
[40:50] 2020 uh
[40:53] what I so my classes range from
[40:58] about like I've had as large as like
[41:00] almost 30 in a class and I've had some
[41:03] classes it's just you know less kids in
[41:05] a year and it down into the high teens
[41:08] and I guarantee you I get more I go
[41:11] deeper and get more accomplished with a
[41:14] smaller group so if that's the case you
[41:16] know and you have a a a smaller ratio of
[41:20] teacher to
[41:22] students you have you have more ability
[41:24] to really help them grow at an
[41:27] exponential rate so if I could have the
[41:29] time and the resources to teach my two
[41:33] kids i' take it in a second you know
[41:36] what I mean so
[41:38] um it'd be interesting to see homeschool
[41:41] develop to where it can be a smaller and
[41:43] smaller group the way we're set up right
[41:45] now it just it's how it is you're going
[41:48] to get your 20 to 30 kids in a class so
[41:52] I I could see a benefit being more local
[41:56] uh being smaller group and you can
[41:59] provide more and better direct care for
[42:03] their
[42:06] needs their desires and their likes and
[42:08] preferences right as much as I love
[42:11] teaching
[42:13] music not everybody in here
[42:15] is going to be a musician you know um
[42:18] and even if they are they're gonna
[42:20] they're going to have wide range of
[42:21] styles like if I had a smaller group I
[42:23] could figure out what they like and I
[42:26] could uh help them grow if they're going
[42:28] to be a software designer you know I can
[42:29] get them coding and their curriculum
[42:32] while they'll still get their math and
[42:33] reading and everything we can make it
[42:35] maybe more uh software development more
[42:38] code.org or whatever you know what I'm
[42:40] saying early on so um the
[42:43] personalization is is a huge component
[42:46] of homeschooling yeah I saw a video the
[42:50] other day where El
[42:52] musk um did homeschooling for his kids
[42:57] with some of the neighbor kids and I
[43:00] researched about it and it's actually a
[43:02] thing that small neighborhoods that
[43:05] Understand Each Other Well have a lot of
[43:06] different uh similar aged kids are
[43:09] getting together and making
[43:11] homeschooling um a community project
[43:14] amongst like five three seven households
[43:19] and this is a I just love the fact that
[43:22] uh the private households come together
[43:25] and say okay he is really good in in
[43:27] math he's like and make it personalized
[43:31] and and small I
[43:33] mean if there are more kids then the
[43:36] personalization it gets lost and it
[43:39] would be maybe the same in the as in the
[43:41] the school but I like the the idea of
[43:45] homeschooling so we having uh Andro at
[43:49] the podcast where the previous guest
[43:53] asked a question for the for the next
[43:56] guest and I just love that that end
[44:01] routine because it always has some some
[44:03] interesting questions um and we did not
[44:07] touch on that actually and it's a
[44:09] Bitcoin question what's your most
[44:12] controversial Bitcoin take uh the
[44:14] Bitcoin take most bitcoiners might
[44:18] disagree with h
[44:22] um that's a good one I could uh I could
[44:26] go with the ETFs are good for Bitcoin
[44:30] lowercase b bad for Bitcoin uppercase B
[44:34] but I think uh as you dig into that more
[44:37] bitcoiners will agree with that than not
[44:39] man you stump me on that one because
[44:43] uh I I I I'm starting to see and maybe
[44:47] more bitcoiners are seeing this now
[44:51] that the whole you know most people
[44:53] won't own a
[44:54] utxo
[44:56] um I'm start I I've been listening to a
[44:59] few podcasts that have really started to
[45:01] describe that and I'm starting to switch
[45:02] to understanding why that's important
[45:06] and even if we're on if we move more
[45:09] people to the lightning
[45:11] Network it's like they're owning a
[45:13] shared utxo
[45:15] so um I don't know how controversial
[45:17] that is
[45:20] though I can see it happening I don't
[45:23] know the solution so I'm just kind of
[45:25] keeping it mine and try and listen but
[45:28] um I got my utx I got to consolidate a
[45:30] little bit but uh there's going to come
[45:33] a point in time where Bas chain is no
[45:36] longer the solution for the majority of
[45:37] the population I mean it also depends on
[45:41] what like there are Bitcoin is now so
[45:45] big that there are different groups of
[45:48] bitcoiners uh there's like privacy crowd
[45:52] uh there's like with utxo there are
[45:55] different kind of crowds also on the uh
[45:59] sides of maybe there's like more the the
[46:01] cyer deine uh approach to like why
[46:04] Bitcoin there there are bitcoiners they
[46:07] say Fe will die in the next five to 10
[46:10] years uh the Bitcoin say no no feed will
[46:14] at least go 100 years 200 years like
[46:17] there I heard so many different opinions
[46:19] on on so many different uh topics and I
[46:23] guess it also depends on what for what
[46:28] group of bitcoiners it would be
[46:31] controversial okay all right so um where
[46:36] can people find you uh the best where
[46:40] can people get in contact with you uh
[46:43] what is the best place to to get in
[46:44] touch with you I would say Twitter X um
[46:49] timore
[46:51] neore n m ye R uh zoom out 21
[46:57] uh uh linol land
[47:00] Bitcoin and also history Echoes Bitcoin
[47:03] I've got all the links in my personal um
[47:07] account uh that would probably be the
[47:09] that's the where I spend most of my time
[47:12] yeah thank you for doing it thank you I
[47:16] appreciate the time appreciate the
[47:17] conversation
