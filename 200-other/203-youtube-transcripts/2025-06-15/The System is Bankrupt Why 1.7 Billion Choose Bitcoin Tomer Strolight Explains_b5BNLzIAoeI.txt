[00:00] Bitcoin is an idea it's spiritual it's
[00:02] it's written into a database but that
[00:04] that as well is not tangible there's no
[00:06] one location that Bitcoin is in it is
[00:09] everywhere that it needs to be
[00:10] everywhere that anybody wants it to be
[00:12] and if you run a node all the Bitcoin
[00:14] not just your Bitcoin all the Bitcoin is
[00:16] is there Bitcoin is more like a
[00:18] technological Revolution than a violent
[00:20] overthrow of government and what happens
[00:22] in those technological revolutions is
[00:24] the incumbents try to resist the
[00:26] technology but then end up getting left
[00:28] behind as it becomes adopted they first
[00:30] serve the people who are over served and
[00:33] unable to be served by the incumbent
[00:35] technology it's all the people who are
[00:36] unbanked who can see the real currency
[00:39] advantages of Bitcoin I don't know
[00:41] anyone who would die over Microsoft Word
[00:43] or Google Chrome but people are prepared
[00:45] to fight to defend their right to run
[00:47] [Music]
[00:51] Bitcoin you describe Bitcoin as
[00:53] spiritual money um what what do you mean
[00:56] by that well um we go really deep into
[01:00] it just at the very high level of the
[01:03] surface there's the spiritual world and
[01:05] the material world right and maybe
[01:09] people divide it in other ways but gold
[01:11] is physical money it's material it's
[01:13] material money Bitcoin is an idea you
[01:16] know it's it's spiritual it's it's
[01:18] written into a database but that's that
[01:20] as well is not tangible there's no one
[01:22] location that Bitcoin is in it is
[01:25] everywhere that every that it needs to
[01:27] be everywhere that anybody wants it to
[01:29] be right if you run a node all the
[01:31] Bitcoin all the Bitcoin not just your
[01:33] Bitcoin all the Bitcoin is is there and
[01:36] it's not there um it's there because we
[01:40] believe in it because we understand the
[01:43] system and how and how it works and and
[01:47] because it then if we go a little bit
[01:49] deeper it has a spirit behind it the
[01:51] spirit of Bitcoin is this idea that
[01:55] money should not be stolen that money
[01:58] that you've earned is your that you can
[02:00] even know enough about what the money is
[02:04] that you can verify it yourself you that
[02:06] the fraud is eliminated from it seizure
[02:08] is eliminated from it uncertainty about
[02:10] its Supply is eliminated from it this is
[02:13] a very powerful idea that's behind
[02:16] Bitcoin and it becomes a spiritual thing
[02:20] for so many people who become invested
[02:23] in and involved in Bitcoin like they're
[02:25] they're behind Bitcoin there are people
[02:27] who would you know fight with their
[02:29] lives for the for the right to run this
[02:31] piece of software that's that's a lot
[02:34] more important than I don't know anyone
[02:36] who would die over Microsoft Word or
[02:38] Google Chrome but people are prepared to
[02:40] fight you know to to fight to defend
[02:42] their right to run Bitcoin so there's a
[02:44] spirit in this thing that's a spirit of
[02:46] Rights of purpose of life and those are
[02:49] some of the you know very quick and
[02:51] introductory ideas uh when I when I talk
[02:54] about Bitcoin is a spiritual form of
[02:58] money why do you think think uh Bitcoin
[03:01] goes so deep because it's interesting
[03:03] like in the end of the day like we could
[03:05] we could say like oh it's just money and
[03:06] it's a tool we we can use the same way
[03:09] as we use feeld or anything else the
[03:11] same way as we use gold but why do you
[03:13] think Bitcoin runs so much deeper and we
[03:16] we tattoo Satoshi symbols on our things
[03:18] and Stu like that yeah um I think that
[03:20] there's a lot of there's a there's a lot
[03:23] of reasons one is it's solving a really
[03:25] big problem that a lot of people when
[03:27] they realize how big the problem is
[03:29] their it stirs their it stir their
[03:32] Spirit right it's like this is really
[03:34] important this is vitally important and
[03:36] it's Irreplaceable you know like I I we
[03:40] live in a civilization where everybody
[03:42] specializes and so because you
[03:45] specialize the what you produce isn't
[03:47] necessarily valuable to any to anyone
[03:49] and everyone at at every period in time
[03:51] so we need money and then when we find
[03:54] out that our money is badly broken and
[03:56] it's filled with deceit and that it gets
[03:58] deflated it it's like well all the time
[04:00] and energy that you put into creating
[04:03] value the thing that you receive in
[04:05] exchange for
[04:07] it is leaking time and energy on you
[04:10] constantly and when you actually find
[04:12] and and you haven't been told that your
[04:15] whole life so there's a giant sense when
[04:17] you discover this is true about Fiat
[04:19] money you feel a giant sense of betrayal
[04:21] right because the issue of the money is
[04:23] the entity the government that had been
[04:26] telling you all your life don't worry
[04:27] we'll take care of you just pay your
[04:28] taxes and this and that the other and
[04:30] then you find out that there's a giant
[04:32] betrayal and many you know there's many
[04:34] other giant betrayals too but Bitcoin is
[04:37] a fix to this giant betrayal and it
[04:39] doesn't say we're going to get the
[04:40] government to behave better it says
[04:42] we're going to take the government out
[04:43] of the thing and um I I think that that
[04:48] is one of the one of the big Awakenings
[04:51] that people have to say if I can if I
[04:53] can take personal responsibility and be
[04:55] a sovereign and independent individual I
[04:58] can work with other Sovereign and
[05:00] independent individuals
[05:02] to to earn to to keep an earn what it is
[05:05] that we want to work on and not to be
[05:08] subject slaves underlings whatever the
[05:10] term that people have so it becomes a
[05:12] very powerful idea if you view yourself
[05:14] as having been stolen from or having
[05:16] been enslaved and you find a path to
[05:19] Freedom it's a revolution it's a
[05:21] revolutionary technology and then you
[05:24] get overwhelmed by saying well you know
[05:26] revolutions are really hard to have and
[05:29] the really bloody and you know and
[05:32] they're they're filled with violence and
[05:33] death and this is a peaceful Revolution
[05:36] all I have to do is run a piece of
[05:37] software and try to teach as many people
[05:39] as I can about it I don't gain anything
[05:42] by spilling any blood and nobody gains
[05:44] anything by spilling my blood so it's a
[05:46] it's it's within the realm of ideas and
[05:49] again it's another form of spiritual
[05:51] it's a spiritual Revolution uh or around
[05:54] what money can be and ought to be and
[05:57] what our responsibilities are for that
[05:59] what it can be and ought to be is that
[06:03] the the first peaceful revolution of
[06:05] that kind or is there something in the
[06:07] past or history that we can compare it
[06:09] to it I think it depends on how you
[06:11] define revolution you know like if you
[06:13] say the Industrial Revolution was a
[06:15] revolution of the same sort where people
[06:18] went from producing a whole thing to
[06:21] working in a factory and turning a crank
[06:24] or a screw and the the scale of
[06:27] production went up dramatically and you
[06:28] call that a revolu ution it's kind of
[06:31] like a technological Revolution well
[06:33] that Revolution is generally bloodless
[06:35] too right like you know people were
[06:37] injured at work and there may have been
[06:38] businessmen who killed other businessmen
[06:40] but it wasn't it wasn't like there was a
[06:42] bloody Revolution to overthrow the
[06:44] previous regime so we've seen a lot of
[06:47] this disruptive technological
[06:50] revolutions we've seen maybe five or six
[06:52] giant phases of of of that happen I
[06:56] think Bitcoin is a unique one because
[06:59] because it well what makes Bitcoin
[07:01] unique As A revolution is it is a
[07:04] revolution that's replacing a very large
[07:07] function of the government so it does
[07:08] qualify as that political
[07:11] revolution um and and it's and we've
[07:13] never seen peaceful political
[07:15] revolutions before unless you just view
[07:17] every election in a democracy as a
[07:19] transition as a peaceful transition of
[07:21] power but you know this this is a taking
[07:24] away of power from the government not
[07:26] putting somebody else in charge of
[07:27] government so that is that's a really
[07:29] powerful
[07:30] distinction super interesting uh but but
[07:34] it's it's the peaceful revolution in
[07:37] Bitcoin like till now it was completely
[07:39] peaceful um I'm I'm just wondering how
[07:43] what the push back from the current like
[07:46] every Revolution is going somewhere and
[07:48] every Revolution is revolutionizing
[07:50] something uh and like big governments
[07:53] and central banks are kind of the uh the
[07:56] opposing sides to the Bitcoin uh if you
[07:59] will so
[08:00] um what do you expect in in the trans
[08:02] transition to a more Bitcoin ised world
[08:06] the the push back from from them will be
[08:09] uh and it will continue to be completely
[08:11] peaceful in in that regard listen it's a
[08:14] it's a good question no one has a you
[08:15] know a perfect Crystal Ball but I think
[08:18] this is where Bitcoin is more like a
[08:20] technological Revolution than a violent
[08:23] overthrow of government and what happens
[08:25] in those technological revolutions is
[08:27] the incumbents try to resist technology
[08:30] but then end up getting left behind as
[08:32] it becomes adopted right some some adapt
[08:35] to the new technology but many find
[08:37] themselves without purpose you know like
[08:39] nobody needs a newspaper anymore to
[08:42] consume information like the physical
[08:45] newspaper and so the Pulp and Paper
[08:46] industry gets disrupted and there's just
[08:49] there's so many elements that get wiped
[08:51] away when a technological Revolution
[08:53] takes place Kodak nobody needs film or
[08:56] cameras you know the the the camera is
[08:59] now in embeded in the phone and the film
[09:00] is just Ram it's just memory
[09:04] so you know the the incumbents get left
[09:07] behind and nobody needs a central bank
[09:09] when everybody's using Bitcoin nobody
[09:12] really needs a bank when everybody's
[09:13] using Bitcoin nobody needs Regulators to
[09:16] tell us how to regulate the banks when
[09:18] nobody's using Banks you know so Bitcoin
[09:21] disintermediate digitizes revolutionizes
[09:24] a lot of the infrastructure that's
[09:27] behind the modern form of money and I I
[09:30] expect the same thing will happen like
[09:32] you can already see it with people who
[09:33] are living a very Bitcoin
[09:36] lifestyle they are either people who
[09:38] don't have access to banking so you know
[09:41] and this is another common um feature of
[09:44] disruptive technology they first serve
[09:47] the people who are over served and
[09:48] unable to be served by the incumbent
[09:51] technology right it's all the people who
[09:53] are unbanked who can see the real
[09:56] currency advantages of Bitcoin and it's
[09:58] all the people who don't have good
[10:00] medium good store of value who are using
[10:02] Bitcoin as a store of value so we've got
[10:04] two very different worlds developing in
[10:07] Bitcoin but in both cases it's serving
[10:09] people who recognize that it's a better
[10:11] alternative to an alternative that they
[10:13] maybe didn't even have in the first
[10:15] instance and then as something grows
[10:17] then it starts to serve the customers of
[10:20] the incumbents right and so now we've
[10:22] actually got the big institutions not
[10:26] taking note like black Rock's got an ETF
[10:28] right they've taken note that people
[10:29] want to invest in Bitcoin and now
[10:31] they're starting to offer the service
[10:33] and get involved in it so bitcoin's
[10:36] beyond that serving the over served
[10:38] market and it's now serving the the
[10:41] market that's highly competitive but
[10:43] it's still very early days the ETFs are
[10:46] not even a year old at the time that
[10:48] we're uh having this this conversation
[10:52] and and and they're still relatively
[10:55] small compared to the entire investment
[10:58] uh the total addressable Market as
[11:00] people refer to it of what Bitcoin is so
[11:02] we're we're following a typical
[11:05] revolutionary disruptive adoption curve
[11:07] but because the total addressable Market
[11:09] is so big and so incumbent and so
[11:11] regulated and slow this is a this is a
[11:14] slower March than like the launch of the
[11:16] iPhone and this is this is going to take
[11:19] decades to completely work its way
[11:20] through the system but it's it's got
[11:23] this constant forward momentum like a
[11:25] ratchet you know every now and then it
[11:27] takes a Quantum Leap Forward and and
[11:29] nobody can move it back from where it is
[11:31] that's super interesting and it's also
[11:33] interesting that uh we're talking about
[11:36] how how how Bitcoin makes governments
[11:38] smaller or maybe even disappear and and
[11:41] now governments are buying Bitcoin so
[11:44] that that's a super interesting
[11:46] connection really early into that right
[11:48] like there may be a couple of odd
[11:50] governments but now we've got the United
[11:51] States government saying that they want
[11:53] to have a strategic Bitcoin Reserve at
[11:54] the time that we're recording they're
[11:56] not sure how much Bitcoin they have
[11:57] they're not sure how they're going to
[11:58] acquire it
[11:59] uh but they're but they're interested in
[12:01] it and this may be a fleeting idea or it
[12:04] may be a it may be the beginning of a
[12:06] very big idea and and it's going to
[12:08] start to take root so no nobody knows
[12:10] exactly how fast it's going to play out
[12:12] or how how slow it'll play out I think
[12:14] that's one of the interesting things
[12:15] there's a lot of people speculating on
[12:17] it and getting disappointed when it
[12:18] doesn't play out as fast as they hoped
[12:20] and and vice versa but um it is it's
[12:25] like the awareness of this thing that it
[12:27] actually can work as money that it isn't
[12:29] just a crazy
[12:31] idea is is evolving and it becomes like
[12:35] the more people who think it's not crazy
[12:37] the more not crazy it actually becomes
[12:39] it it will get normalized think like if
[12:42] you mention Bitcoin like in 2012 people
[12:45] said like oh what is bitcoin then like
[12:47] somewhere uh if you mention it I don't
[12:49] know 2016 2017 people are
[12:52] like it's a pyramid scheme or something
[12:55] like that depending on on where you are
[12:57] and now it it's really hard to say that
[12:59] Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme where where
[13:02] when it's getting so normalized big
[13:04] institutions big governments big
[13:05] companies are buying it it's kind of
[13:07] like getting normalized from every every
[13:10] thing it's that's that's an interesting
[13:13] uh uh uh adoption curve that is already
[13:16] H happening yes yeah and I you know I I
[13:19] think so many of these large Financial
[13:23] institutional ideas can be deemed as
[13:26] pyramid schemes like the Social Security
[13:28] the national pension plans right the
[13:30] young people pay in the old people take
[13:32] out and the idea wasn't that they'd be a
[13:34] pyramid scheme the idea was well the
[13:36] economy will grow and new young people
[13:38] will come in and pay the people who are
[13:39] young now when they're when they're old
[13:41] and ideally everything would have been
[13:43] fully funded but even if it isn't
[13:45] there's a sense of that there's this
[13:47] rolling funding of it so it's not just a
[13:50] pyramid scheme it's a self- sustaining
[13:52] ongoing process like like something
[13:55] that's alive right but it turns out that
[13:58] that that's really problematic in a Fiat
[14:01] world and and when people catch on to
[14:03] the game of of Fiat that's when it
[14:06] really gets tough and and so now we're
[14:08] at a moment in history where young
[14:10] people can't even afford to pay for
[14:11] their own living let alone pay for the
[14:13] retirement of old people and old people
[14:16] have sucked a lot of the money out of
[14:17] the system already so we have this
[14:20] funding dilemma and and you if you paint
[14:24] Bitcoin as something that is it's you
[14:26] know it's a retirement it's a
[14:27] replacement for your retirement Sav so
[14:29] you look at it as this long-term store
[14:31] of value solution it too if if it didn't
[14:34] fix Society if it didn't fix
[14:36] civilization and make it possible for
[14:37] young people to save their money and
[14:39] earn what they want to and spend on
[14:42] their lives then it would in fact
[14:44] ultimately at least as a store of value
[14:46] be some kind of pyramid scheme like
[14:47] let's get young people to buy it so old
[14:49] people can live nicely who who had more
[14:51] money to buy Bitcoin in the first place
[14:53] who had more Fiat money to buy Bitcoin
[14:55] in the first place so but I think it's
[14:57] much much more than just an in
[14:59] investment and an alternative to the
[15:01] pension schemes that are now failing us
[15:04] it's actually a fix for society because
[15:06] you don't have the redistributive
[15:09] effects which are political in their
[15:11] nature that steal from the hardworking
[15:14] and give to the not working which which
[15:16] ultimately has hollowed out at least
[15:18] Western Civilization it's what been one
[15:21] of the biggest breakdowns in terms of
[15:24] what made Western Civilization so
[15:26] productive and so successful the the
[15:29] more people who have become parasites on
[15:32] the economy in a sense right or who
[15:34] aren't able to contribute but end up
[15:36] receiving from those who do
[15:38] contribute end up weakening the
[15:41] civilization and the economy and then
[15:43] you end up with these big disparities of
[15:45] of those who have taking from those who
[15:48] have not already and those who have not
[15:50] then just giving up on the game and and
[15:52] not believing in the civilization any
[15:54] longer that's my my big hope for Bitcoin
[15:57] that this proof of work mentality comes
[16:00] back in in society that that you're like
[16:02] okay if if you want something then you
[16:05] have to do do something for that proof
[16:07] of work combined with the scarcity is is
[16:10] the fundamental GameChanger here right
[16:12] like we the problem with five Decades of
[16:16] true Fiat money is money is conjured up
[16:20] out of thin air for people with
[16:21] political pull and like then there's no
[16:23] there's no nice way to say that and
[16:25] there's and there's no point in trying
[16:27] to paint it more more nicely and and
[16:30] everyone is grows up be by and large
[16:33] being told work hard you know study hard
[16:36] work hard and you'll earn money and
[16:38] you'll and you'll succeed and that and
[16:41] that ought to be and that makes perfect
[16:42] sense because it's like if you produce a
[16:44] lot of stuff you're you're creating
[16:46] value for the world and the world will
[16:47] pay you for your value but there's a
[16:49] there's something glitched in the system
[16:51] which is that what you get paid with has
[16:53] a loophole and certain people have
[16:55] access to that loophole and they're
[16:57] abusing that loophole EX to
[16:59] extraordinary de degree right like the
[17:01] amount of Fiat money that's printed and
[17:03] distributed to political you know to
[17:06] people with political favor is off the
[17:08] charts right we got a$ 35 trillion
[17:10] dollar deficit trillions of dollars get
[17:12] printed here and there government
[17:14] contracts are awarded left right and
[17:15] center and the attempt you know we've
[17:18] got Elon Musk now trying to fix it in
[17:20] the United States with his Department of
[17:21] government
[17:23] efficiency but what if we didn't have
[17:25] corruption what if the money wasn't
[17:27] corruptible in the first place like how
[17:28] did the money get Miss get misspent well
[17:32] it had to be in the hands of people who
[17:33] could misspend it and how do people who
[17:35] misspend money end up with so much money
[17:37] well because they have access to this
[17:39] thing called the money printer they can
[17:40] conjure it out of thin air they haven't
[17:42] earned it they haven't you know people
[17:43] haven't surrendered it to them
[17:45] voluntarily they haven't even
[17:46] surrendered it to them involuntarily
[17:48] through taxation it's been manufactured
[17:50] out of thin air through a money printer
[17:52] on top of that and that's the Dilemma
[17:55] that makes the world so unfair for
[17:57] people who want to have work ethic and
[17:59] contribute to the civilization when you
[18:02] listen to and I listen to the podcast
[18:04] from IL musk I think on Jo Rogan where
[18:06] he talked about do and and the things
[18:08] that he found and it kind of like like
[18:11] what there's a it's it's a lot more than
[18:16] than I thought and a lot more
[18:17] [Music]
[18:22] nonsensical you find you find it because
[18:24] you've seen all these scandals come and
[18:26] go and and you just see that it gets
[18:28] bigger and bigger and bigger right and I
[18:30] think this is the problem that you can't
[18:33] re in government from within government
[18:36] you have a president like Ronald Reagan
[18:38] and now you have the current Trump
[18:39] Administration who makes some effort but
[18:41] when you actually step back and look at
[18:43] it it's like there's so it's like if
[18:45] you've got a garden that's filled with
[18:46] weeds of all different kinds and they
[18:48] keep spreading and growing and and you
[18:50] decide to make an effort now after 50
[18:53] years of weeds growing to pull all the
[18:55] weeds they're going to grow faster than
[18:57] you can pull them and there's going to
[18:58] be so many in so many places and they
[19:00] cast their seeds so wide I think that
[19:02] that's really what's become of our
[19:05] government like there's more there's
[19:07] more departments and you can count they
[19:09] have more employees and you can count
[19:10] they can't keep count of their expenses
[19:13] and there's been a such a sloppiness in
[19:16] the quality of decisionmaking that
[19:19] they're making they including the
[19:20] decision makers that they've hired that
[19:23] people don't even know what's going on
[19:24] anymore and it you and so you need to
[19:27] fix the system from outside the system
[19:28] system and that's really what Bitcoin is
[19:30] doing you know as more and more people
[19:32] recognize that Bitcoin is honest
[19:35] Justified like just money not just not
[19:37] only money but money that is just they
[19:40] put more and more of their value into it
[19:42] they store more and more of their value
[19:43] into it again we're really early but as
[19:45] they do that they defang they take the
[19:48] resources away from all this misspending
[19:51] from all these all these weeds if we
[19:53] stick with that Garden metaphor and so
[19:55] only genuine honest money can can grow
[19:59] in value and if you lose your Bitcoin
[20:01] you've made bad decisions and it ends up
[20:03] in the hands of people who make good
[20:05] decisions right with respect to money
[20:07] rather than there's some money printer
[20:09] of Bitcoin that some bureaucrats get to
[20:11] keep making more and more and more of
[20:13] each year and every time they spend all
[20:15] their money they vote themselves a
[20:17] increase to the debt ceiling so that
[20:18] they can create more like that's what
[20:20] that's what's being closed off and
[20:22] that's all we need to close off to fix
[20:24] our society it's going to be slow it's
[20:26] going to be long but it's going to fix
[20:28] this problem
[20:29] without a revolution to restore us with
[20:31] a new government that would ultimately
[20:32] just restart the same problem that we
[20:35] have right now right we need to take the
[20:36] thing out of the hands of government and
[20:39] this is to quote haek to to paraphrase
[20:42] this is that that Sly roundabout way to
[20:44] take the thing out of the hands of
[20:45] government that's the important part
[20:46] yeah true because also see like even if
[20:48] you see the full potential of like what
[20:50] what do the this uh Department can do um
[20:55] the printing so much more money on the
[20:57] back side of it like it almost does not
[20:59] make any difference in the end it's it's
[21:02] great that they put the efforts but it's
[21:04] it's a system that's broken not uh not
[21:07] not small players in there um how do you
[21:11] think is what is the implications of of
[21:13] that if if governments longterm cannot
[21:16] no longer print money because it's it's
[21:18] basically has no value and we are moving
[21:20] more towards a Bitcoin standard what
[21:22] what what will that do to uh
[21:25] civilization and and all the governments
[21:27] yeah it'll it'll make for a smaller
[21:29] government civilization right it like I
[21:31] think we got caught up in a lot of the
[21:33] Socialist ideas which is if Government
[21:36] can provide education and government can
[21:38] provide health care and government can
[21:40] provide the roads and government can
[21:41] provide n oversight of of nutrition and
[21:44] food and Agriculture and government can
[21:46] provide oversight of medication and Dr
[21:49] and drugs and government you know and
[21:51] the list goes on and on and on and on
[21:53] you end up with this single Monopoly
[21:55] that doesn't have to be profitable in
[21:58] terms of delivering value because it's
[21:59] not generating any revenue from its
[22:01] customers it's printing money and taxing
[22:04] the taxpayer and the qual you know the
[22:08] diversity of offerings diminishes The
[22:11] Innovation within the offerings
[22:12] diminishes because there's no real
[22:14] competition and the quality of service
[22:17] diminishes because you don't have the
[22:18] customer having the ability to say I
[22:20] don't like the quality so I'm not paying
[22:22] for it and so you you have no Market
[22:24] mechanism in so many of the most
[22:26] important industries of our c
[22:28] civilization Bitcoin fixes that by
[22:30] choking off the thing that's
[22:32] substituting free markets and so I think
[22:35] we'll I think we'll end up seeing a
[22:36] world with a lot more diversity of
[22:38] offerings in these areas there won't be
[22:41] consensus but it won't be like right now
[22:43] we have a consensus about how to educate
[22:44] everybody and it's wrong like you know
[22:47] we we're putting out dumber and dumber
[22:49] people who are more and more
[22:51] indoctrinated and less and less capable
[22:52] of critical
[22:54] thought and they're all subject to the
[22:56] same system that failing them all right
[23:00] so we may not end up with a per I don't
[23:01] think we'll end up with a perfect system
[23:03] what we'll end up with is a system that
[23:05] keeps getting better through the nature
[23:06] of competition people will say oh my
[23:08] kid's not getting a good education at
[23:10] this school I'll move them to another
[23:12] school that looks like it's doing a
[23:13] better job or I don't like this approach
[23:15] to teaching I'll choose to purchase a
[23:17] different approach to teaching uh for
[23:20] myself or my kids and so we'll start to
[23:22] get more diversity more Choice some
[23:25] choices will be right for some people
[23:26] and wrong for other people so people
[23:27] will be Tim make the choice that's right
[23:29] for them and and that's what's going to
[23:31] happen across the board we'll give up on
[23:34] this idea of everything should be
[23:36] provided by the government because it's
[23:37] so important that it needs to be an
[23:39] essential service and we'll take a awful
[23:41] version of it for everybody universally
[23:44] so that everyone we can say that
[23:46] everybody's getting it but that's a big
[23:48] part of the Awakening of civilization
[23:50] right now that like that our attempt to
[23:52] provide everybody with everything
[23:53] universally and homogeneously hasn't
[23:56] worked out like we have to we have to
[23:58] come to that realization and and admit
[24:00] that it didn't work and maybe we don't
[24:02] even have to admit that it didn't work
[24:03] it just has to stop working to the point
[24:05] where people start choosing private
[24:07] Alternatives but there's still a big
[24:08] political tension over those issues like
[24:11] if you surveyed the population in
[24:12] various countries you'd find I'm I'm
[24:15] making this up but it's kind of my
[24:16] intuition at least 40% of people and
[24:19] probably as as much as 90% of people
[24:21] believe the government should provide
[24:23] public education to everybody right so
[24:25] it's like a long way to go before the
[24:28] government stops doing it or people
[24:30] believe that the government ought to
[24:31] stop doing it in large
[24:34] numbers well um you mentioned Awakening
[24:37] is is that something uh bigger than than
[24:40] Bitcoin uh is that something like the uh
[24:44] yeah I think that there's there's like
[24:47] Bitcoin plays a really interesting part
[24:48] in this General Awakening towards we've
[24:51] gone we've let the pendulum swing far
[24:52] too far in in the direction of
[24:55] government of the size of government and
[24:57] the Mandate of government um there is a
[25:01] broad Awakening taking place but Bitcoin
[25:04] gives firmament to that Awakening you
[25:07] know like before before Bitcoin you
[25:09] might have said well you know
[25:11] government's too big but what can I do
[25:13] about it I can go and protest you know
[25:15] don't make government smaller but that
[25:17] doesn't do anything and if enough people
[25:19] protest then the government shows up
[25:21] with hoses and washes everyone's way and
[25:23] some Nations they show up with bullets
[25:25] and they and they shoot everyone away
[25:27] and it takes a lot and like the stamina
[25:29] to protest and to make effective change
[25:33] is really you know it's limited like how
[25:36] long can you stand in a protest for a
[25:38] few weeks you know a month like here I
[25:40] live in Canada people were protesting
[25:43] the covid vaccine mandates and the
[25:46] government declared a state of emergency
[25:47] cleaned them all out arrested them froze
[25:49] their bank accounts Bitcoin on the other
[25:52] hand is a is a form of protest right
[25:54] it's a protest against the Fiat nature
[25:56] of of the world but you don't have to go
[25:59] somewhere with a picket sign to protest
[26:02] you run a node in your house somewhere
[26:03] or some or someplace else you keep your
[26:06] cold storage Keys someplace and so the
[26:08] government that you're not concentrating
[26:10] all the people tired and hungry in front
[26:12] of the government building so that they
[26:13] can come with the hose and wash you away
[26:15] if the government wants to stop Bitcoin
[26:17] they have to go to each and every house
[26:18] of each and every person who has a note
[26:20] and stop it and it doesn't really stop
[26:22] it because each and every person outside
[26:24] of the government's jurisdiction who's
[26:25] running Bitcoin keeps the entire system
[26:28] running so it's a form of protest that
[26:30] the government can't stop and doesn't
[26:32] have this and they've they're the ones
[26:34] who now have to have the stamina right
[26:35] like Bitcoin keeps on running so like
[26:37] how many weeks how many months of energy
[26:39] is the government prepared to put in
[26:41] fighting Bitcoin ultimately they'll
[26:43] conce they all concede it's not worth
[26:45] fighting some might even go so far as it
[26:47] well we can't beat them so we'll join
[26:49] them but I think governments around the
[26:51] world tend to realize after some effort
[26:54] that they didn't manage to stop Bitcoin
[26:56] and most of them just forget about it
[26:58] and move on because they forget about it
[27:00] because they've got some other big
[27:01] Scandal that they're dealing with or
[27:02] some other big program that they're
[27:03] trying to fund but Bitcoin just as a
[27:06] protest keeps growing and growing and
[27:08] growing and never stops it's like a a
[27:11] block every 10 minutes it keeps on going
[27:13] each block represents energy into the
[27:16] protest move is that um uh the the the
[27:19] governments you you said like uh the
[27:22] they can ignore it they can they can
[27:24] fight it they can join it where are we
[27:27] there right now it's seems like we're
[27:28] already maybe in the joining part but I
[27:30] don't know how much you really
[27:32] understand it or you just want to get
[27:34] wats at that point yeah I I think I
[27:37] think Bitcoin is a really hard thing to
[27:39] understand and there's so many facets of
[27:40] it that you can understand some facets
[27:42] and be completely ignorant or backwards
[27:44] on other facets and still see it one way
[27:47] or another I do think you know we're at
[27:50] a point in history
[27:51] where a very large part of the world's
[27:54] governments are no longer fighting it
[27:56] right the the fighting stage is coming
[27:59] to an end and and in particular with
[28:02] some Nations joining it other nations
[28:04] are going to quickly have to realize
[28:06] that there's no point in fighting it or
[28:08] or they'll get left behind and some
[28:09] Nations will fight it and get left
[28:11] behind this is just you know inevitable
[28:14] right it's not everyone the game theor
[28:16] say oh everybody's rational and they'll
[28:18] study it and they'll understand it and
[28:19] they'll recognize that they need to get
[28:21] into it as fast as they possibly can
[28:23] before everybody else does so we'll have
[28:25] you know we'll have a hyper good
[28:26] colonization moment I don't think that's
[28:28] right not because the theory doesn't
[28:31] have a consistent logic but that the
[28:33] theory doesn't correspond to the
[28:35] behavior of individuals which is
[28:36] individuals particularly in governments
[28:38] are not rational they they're
[28:41] self-interest or they're not rational in
[28:43] an objective sense of actually serving
[28:45] the purpose of the government or being
[28:47] of the people or of being smart right
[28:49] they are they're self-interested they
[28:52] have a million different things to focus
[28:53] on understanding bitcoin's hard so many
[28:56] of them will misunderstand it Miss
[28:58] misclassify it and be uninterested in it
[29:02] or opposed to it even while other
[29:04] nations and other companies are
[29:06] accumulating it and that's the Breakaway
[29:08] opportunity for those who do become
[29:11] enlightened sooner rather than later it
[29:13] is interesting how this has been a very
[29:14] Bottoms Up adoption for Bitcoin right
[29:18] from the first from people who do
[29:20] understand cryptography and monetary
[29:22] Theory and Austrian economics then to
[29:25] people who are affected by inflation you
[29:27] know and to people who are lack banking
[29:30] facilities to now corporations with
[29:33] treasury strategies and potentially
[29:35] governments with strategies for like all
[29:37] treasury strategies as well but on a
[29:39] national level let's take a break for a
[29:41] moment and appreciate the beauty that
[29:44] coin vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[29:47] watches those watches are the most
[29:49] amazing the most elegent way of showing
[29:52] that you are a true bitcoiner and coin
[29:56] vigilante just dropped a complete
[29:58] completely new and amazing Genesis
[30:00] edition of their watch collections you
[30:03] have the date of the first ever Mind
[30:06] Bitcoin Block in there and of course
[30:09] also the block height and which EPO we
[30:12] are currently in I love the level of
[30:15] detail they put in in this masterpiece
[30:17] make sure to check out those amazing
[30:20] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[30:23] descriptions I love those watches so so
[30:26] much and now if you have Bitcoin I
[30:28] really do hope that you don't have it on
[30:31] Exchange but if you do have it on
[30:32] Exchange I have two ways for you to deal
[30:34] with that the first way is you put it on
[30:37] a hardware wallet that's the entry for
[30:39] you to get into the self custody game I
[30:43] recommend bitbox Bitcoin only Edition
[30:46] for that it's a super simple and secure
[30:49] way and if you check out the link in the
[30:51] description you even get 5% off if you
[30:54] use the code Robin and the second way is
[30:57] the Bitcoin way the Bitcoin way is your
[31:00] Allin partner in terms of how to get the
[31:04] most out of your sovereignty they will
[31:07] personalize for you a self custody setup
[31:10] that is perfect for your individual
[31:13] situation they will show you how you can
[31:15] secure your own devices securing your
[31:18] Bitcoin is not enough you also have to
[31:20] keep all your devices secure one topic
[31:23] that is overlooked often is the
[31:24] inheritance plan what happens with your
[31:28] Bitcoin once you are no longer here do
[31:31] you have a plan for that in place
[31:33] already and last but not least if you're
[31:35] in a jurisdictions where you don't feel
[31:37] safe it's better to get a plan B for all
[31:40] that head over to the Bitcoin way.com SL
[31:44] robobin to get a 30 minute free call and
[31:48] just a quick side note I will be for the
[31:50] first time ever speaking at the Bitcoin
[31:53] Prague event in June it will be
[31:56] absolutely legendary and I'm really
[31:58] looking forward to seeing all of you
[32:00] there you can get your ticket in the
[32:02] link down in the description of Bitcoin
[32:05] brag and very important use code Robin
[32:07] to get 10% off your ticket I'm really
[32:11] looking forward seeing you there what do
[32:13] you think is the the mental barrier that
[32:16] that I mean there's like nation states
[32:18] there's uh companies there's individuals
[32:22] uh but even like na nation states and
[32:24] companies is just a group of people in
[32:26] the end of the day and there group that
[32:28] the people that make decisions so for me
[32:30] it's always back to the individual that
[32:32] has kind of the the barrier to to
[32:35] understand Bitcoin and I can fully
[32:38] understand why why you don't get Bitcoin
[32:40] in in 2013 but in 2025 we come to a
[32:43] point where it it the education and
[32:46] materials the resources uh and also the
[32:49] proof that Bitcoin already went through
[32:51] those 16 years of running and and
[32:54] surviving so many attacks it gets it
[32:56] gets so obvious if you actually look
[32:59] look a little bit deeper what's the
[33:02] mental barrier for for people for 99% of
[33:05] people I mean in the worst case it's
[33:08] there are people who the mental barrier
[33:11] is one of you know like you can't get
[33:14] someone to understand something that
[33:15] they're paid to not understand the
[33:17] famous quote by I think Mark Twain uh
[33:19] but it might be some it might be
[33:20] somebody else but it's like you know if
[33:22] you're running the European Central Bank
[33:24] you're not going to give a fair hearing
[33:26] to bitcoin right you're like but you
[33:28] love the idea of a cbdc even though when
[33:31] you hear the words you speak it sounds
[33:33] like the most evil invention anyone
[33:35] could come up with and you're promoting
[33:37] uh the deployment of an evil invention
[33:39] that will take rights away from people
[33:41] Freedom away from people the opportunity
[33:43] to escape away from people and so like
[33:45] you hear the central Bankers speaking
[33:46] they they sound like villains to any not
[33:48] just to bitcoiners they sound like
[33:50] villains to anyone who believes that
[33:51] people should be free and um and yet
[33:55] their their mental block is well you
[33:58] know and my incentives my paycheck my
[34:01] duties are to preserve this entity that
[34:04] does this thing that I've been told is
[34:06] good and so you know at some point you
[34:08] realize you're the bad guy but it's a
[34:09] very long way and and people who tend to
[34:12] go work for that thing are not people
[34:14] who are deeply analytical about the
[34:15] problems and flaws with it right people
[34:18] who rise up through that system and
[34:19] recognize its flaws leave it rather than
[34:22] get promoted to the very top of it so I
[34:24] I think in a lot of these structures
[34:26] that are very powerful and very
[34:29] incumbent it's very hard for individuals
[34:33] who are enlightened about these changes
[34:36] to to rise to the top of them and so
[34:38] it's not actually obvious right like the
[34:41] the head of the World Bank is not it
[34:44] does not see it as obvious that
[34:45] bitcoin's coming and then chooses to do
[34:47] something evil to stop it they're like
[34:49] they're annoyed by this thing they're
[34:50] bothered by it it seems evil to them
[34:53] because they're on a mission to do good
[34:55] and this is disrupting their ability to
[34:57] try to do what they're doing they
[34:59] they're not doing a very objective
[35:01] analysis of how much good or bad they've
[35:03] done in the last 30 years they just
[35:04] think it's it's the only thing to do
[35:06] right like we're we're the institution
[35:08] charged with this mandate and we're
[35:11] using the tools at our disposal to
[35:13] achieve our mandate and they don't work
[35:15] perfect but you know it's the it's the
[35:17] best thing we've got is what they think
[35:19] and if someone says well here's Bitcoin
[35:20] an alternative they're like what doesn't
[35:22] even have the options we have like we
[35:23] can at least raise interest rates and
[35:25] lower interest rates we can print money
[35:27] and not print we can ease money and
[35:29] tighten money what Bitcoin has no
[35:31] choices it's just got this fixed
[35:32] monetary policy how is that a fix and it
[35:35] is but they don't see it right like they
[35:37] don't see that the problem is that
[35:38] they're playing games with the interest
[35:40] rates and the money supply and that
[35:41] Bitcoin isn't and that that's what that
[35:44] the fixers taking away the limited tools
[35:46] that they
[35:48] have I think that do do really
[35:52] interesting things in there I think like
[35:53] the the rules without rulers a lot of
[35:56] people have problem with that I I I
[35:59] think there's a a large group of people
[36:02] and even when I speak with some people
[36:04] outside of Bitcoin or like friends of
[36:06] friends when you come to like bigger
[36:08] Gatherings um people really want to have
[36:11] something above them that that gives
[36:13] them guidance and like brings them
[36:15] security and and those things and like
[36:18] that the concept of having rules that
[36:20] are set in in place but there's no one
[36:23] to actually rule those rules like the
[36:26] rulers are Miss
[36:28] a lot of people have really big mental
[36:30] barriers with that yeah we've grown up
[36:32] in a world where we've been told that
[36:34] there are Ben benevolent rulers and if
[36:35] they're malevolent we can vote them out
[36:38] so we don't have to worry and we should
[36:39] just accept rulers nature is different
[36:42] right Nature has rules and nobody can
[36:44] change them and nobody can violate them
[36:46] the laws of nature are inviolable and
[36:49] unchangeable and you you can learn the
[36:51] laws of nature and use them in more
[36:53] creative ways that's that's what
[36:55] invention and science really are all
[36:57] about um and nobody seems to have a
[37:00] problem with that like no no nobody's
[37:01] shaking their fist in the air and saying
[37:03] why does gravity exist you know like I
[37:05] want I want to change the laws of
[37:08] gravity um but everyone's petitioning in
[37:11] the streets I want to change this law
[37:13] and I want to change that law the
[37:15] man-made laws and so there is an
[37:17] Enlightenment and an acceptance of
[37:20] reality and so much of uh this attempt
[37:23] to get benevolent rulers to do perfect
[37:26] things is
[37:28] is rested upon the what I would argue is
[37:31] a very flawed notion that you can
[37:32] achieve Perfection or Utopia right that
[37:35] if we just meddle enough in every single
[37:38] thing we'll create a perfect Society
[37:40] with no crime bright people abundant
[37:43] wealth and and the truth is the reality
[37:46] of it is uglier right like you C you're
[37:47] not going to have one genius at the top
[37:49] saying you do this you do that you do
[37:52] this to like seven billion people and
[37:55] being right for each and every one one
[37:57] of them and write for the whole
[37:59] collectively this is why free markets
[38:01] are the best solution that we're aware
[38:03] of because people try to do what they
[38:06] think is good for a group of people who
[38:08] they think it's good for and if that
[38:09] group of people thinks it's good for
[38:11] them then they pay them for it but if
[38:13] they don't they don't pay them for it
[38:14] and that person learns a lesson that
[38:16] they had a wrong idea and they move on
[38:18] to another idea that's right they don't
[38:20] just have an infinite money printer from
[38:23] I I wanted to do this and now you know
[38:25] 30 years later my descendants continue
[38:27] to do do this but it's not benefiting
[38:29] anybody anymore so we need to allow
[38:31] failures in the system we need to allow
[38:33] death in the system of bad ideas and we
[38:36] need to allow innovation of the existing
[38:38] ideas so that they can get better and
[38:40] that's what free markets allow for and
[38:42] and the idea of a ruler is an idea of
[38:45] not a free market right especially when
[38:46] you're talking about it at a government
[38:48] level you're someone who's saying I'm
[38:50] I'm choosing for others right I so
[38:53] people don't get the free choice they
[38:55] are required to go along with what I
[38:58] have decided for them and that's and
[39:00] that's the fundamental flaw and people
[39:02] keep you know they're like okay well
[39:04] this last guy didn't deliver his
[39:05] promises so I'm voting him out and
[39:06] voting the new guy he's got a great set
[39:08] of promises and he says everything's
[39:10] going to go good and then that doesn't
[39:11] work out so we vote him out and vote the
[39:13] next guy and we're just on this
[39:14] ridiculous treadmill of insanity you
[39:17] know people who say that the definition
[39:18] of insanity is doing the same thing over
[39:20] and over and expecting different results
[39:22] it really feels like that's what's
[39:23] become of democracy right we keep voting
[39:25] out the last to vote in the new
[39:28] guy who promises to be amazing and turns
[39:29] out to be an to to repeat the
[39:32] cycle over and over and over and over
[39:34] again and by the time you get to be my
[39:35] age you realize gee we've been doing
[39:38] this you know we've elected like 10
[39:40] leaders in in my time here and each and
[39:43] the pattern seems to be forming that we
[39:45] don't like any of them after a few
[39:48] years I I still have hope but probably
[39:51] just because I'm
[39:54] young you become jaded against I mean I
[39:56] have lots of hope thanks to bitcoin
[39:58] right I've lost I've become jaded about
[40:00] democracy I've lost my faith in it I
[40:02] think it's gotten much worse in fact in
[40:04] the time that I've been alive uh but I
[40:06] have hope because of Bitcoin because
[40:08] Bitcoin lets us opt out of choosing
[40:10] who's going to us right you know
[40:12] like who's going choosing who whose lies
[40:16] we're going to believe as promises that
[40:19] are that are going to be unfulfilled and
[40:21] like Bitcoin makes promises and it keeps
[40:23] every one of them
[40:25] absolutely and and the the one thing
[40:27] that I never get about socialist system
[40:29] it's it's it's a very arrogant thing to
[40:33] say it's like oh I want to design a
[40:36] socialist system because I know how the
[40:39] world works
[40:40] better uh and I know what people really
[40:44] want and because in socialist system you
[40:46] always have to decide centrally on on on
[40:48] matters basically and then it's like do
[40:51] do you really know how would how do how
[40:55] do you decide all those small points in
[40:58] details and and figure out the an army
[41:00] of bureaucrats and and told them to
[41:03] decide on my behalf for you how about
[41:05] you don't hire anybody and let me decide
[41:06] on my behalf for me like what a radical
[41:09] idea if we don't have an army of
[41:11] bureaucrats meddling in every a single
[41:13] person's life who don't know their names
[41:15] who don't care about them who care about
[41:17] themselves instead it's like it just
[41:19] seems so obvious once you live through
[41:21] it for long enough that this doesn't
[41:22] work and yet it's not obvious to the
[41:25] people who are executing the
[41:27] instructions of the Socialist
[41:30] bureaucracy of the centralized
[41:32] bureaucracy it it's um it's a startling
[41:35] phenomenon it's you know and history
[41:37] will look back at this stage of
[41:40] civilization and say didn't it seem
[41:43] obvious to them at least after some
[41:44] period of time that this thing wasn't
[41:45] working like why did they keep trying it
[41:47] over and over and over again but that'll
[41:50] be you know that'll be at a point in
[41:51] history when we've accepted that um that
[41:55] being ruled is not the nature of a human
[41:58] being that a human being needs to rule
[42:01] themselves you know you need to be your
[42:03] own ruler you need to be Sovereign but
[42:05] we're so far away from that right like
[42:08] it's it's not what's taught in the
[42:09] school so you have to discover you have
[42:11] to be Sovereign enough to discover that
[42:13] you can and should be a
[42:15] sovereign how much should bitcoiners
[42:18] care about what's going on with local
[42:22] politics like I don't know in your state
[42:24] politicians your your local politicians
[42:27] in your town I don't know I don't know I
[42:29] I think bitcoiners are like bitcoiners
[42:32] are becoming much more Diversified in
[42:35] their priorities and interests you know
[42:37] you've got you've got OG type Cipher
[42:40] punks you've got people who are in it to
[42:42] preserve their wealth you've got people
[42:44] who are in it for its political impact
[42:46] and so I think it's it's like as a
[42:49] voting block interestingly enough if we
[42:51] refer even though going say we don't we
[42:53] we should not be voting right but maybe
[42:55] we should be voting government out or
[42:57] voting minim you know minarchists in as
[43:00] a voting Block it's a very Diversified
[43:02] Group and bitcoiners are they seem to be
[43:06] on a constant Learning Journey so if you
[43:08] take any one bitcoiner at two points in
[43:11] time their views are much more evolved
[43:14] nuanced adapted or focused on current
[43:16] issues that are different than they used
[43:18] to be at those two different points in
[43:20] time like the the Bitcoin journey is a
[43:22] journey of growth
[43:24] and for some people maybe it's it's not
[43:27] that much it's like oh I heard there
[43:28] were 21 million so it's a good store of
[43:30] value and I bought some and I forgot
[43:31] about it that may be the case for some
[43:34] of them but for many bitcoiners this is
[43:36] this is a revolution this is a movement
[43:38] this is something that they're learning
[43:39] more and more about and they're getting
[43:41] involved in everything sometimes it's
[43:42] kind of laughable right like the the
[43:44] whole Bitcoin movement will become
[43:45] experts on whatever the current thing is
[43:48] in in news media so they'll become
[43:51] constitutional experts they'll become
[43:53] experts on UFOs they'll become experts
[43:55] on diets and on medications but you know
[43:58] on the whole it's it's still quite
[44:00] interesting to see this is what
[44:01] Sovereign education looks like it's not
[44:03] you learned everything you needed to
[44:05] from the time you were six to the time
[44:07] you were 18 and now you don't need to
[44:09] learn anymore it's actually what's going
[44:11] on right now how do I learn about it and
[44:13] and what's my view on what ought to be
[44:15] the case what we ought to do and whether
[44:17] or not you know government should or
[44:19] shouldn't be involved and Bitcoin fixes
[44:21] it or not like I think that's that's
[44:23] part of what's really interesting about
[44:25] about this movement it's a self
[44:27] educated uh ongoing education movement
[44:31] and so that's that that also speaks to
[44:33] why it's so um antifragile right the
[44:37] people who want who want rulers and want
[44:41] to be ruled and want to select their
[44:42] rulers through voting have the same
[44:44] answer to the to all the new problems
[44:47] like there's a new problem oh well
[44:48] what's a politician what what are the
[44:50] two politicians who are running for
[44:51] office say that that they're each going
[44:52] to do and I'm going to pick one of two
[44:55] solutions that somebody else has come up
[44:56] with rather than let's take a look at
[44:58] the problem let's try to understand it
[45:00] what are the different options of fixes
[45:02] which one am I going to choose for
[45:03] myself and why right that's so
[45:06] fundamentally different which one are
[45:07] you know which one's going to win the
[45:08] popularity contest and be the solution
[45:10] for everybody out of a choice of two
[45:12] when there's a universe of hundred
[45:14] choices or you know unlimited choices in
[45:17] reality yeah it's it's fascinating uh
[45:20] how you have forced in America I mean in
[45:23] Austria and other countries I don't know
[45:24] how it's actually in Canada you have at
[45:26] least like three or four sometimes five
[45:29] uh different parties where it it's at
[45:32] least like a little bit of more diverse
[45:34] choice but a two-party system is like
[45:36] wow like there there
[45:39] this it seems to be like oh it's like
[45:42] left or right and and there's like 50
[45:44] Solutions in between there that's not
[45:46] even discussed uh but at least left and
[45:49] right or like on a completely different
[45:51] tangent yeah so I think this is this is
[45:54] the you know I used to be a very very
[45:57] staunch advocate for believer of
[45:58] democracy even as an imperfect system
[46:00] right like I didn't think democracy was
[46:02] perfect but as Winston Churchill said
[46:04] it's it's the worst system except for
[46:05] all the others and I've come around to
[46:08] the view that no there's a better system
[46:10] right bit Bitcoin is the better system
[46:12] the system that that guarantees
[46:15] individual inviable sovereignty to each
[46:18] individual by establishing rules that
[46:21] can't be changed that can't be
[46:23] compromised upon and that are just to
[46:25] begin with and once you have that and
[46:27] you're able to use energy and
[46:30] cryptography to secure those rules and
[46:32] make them inviolable you've got a better
[46:35] system and that's what the world is
[46:36] slowly
[46:37] learning interesting are you then also
[46:41] not voting because uh you you you don't
[46:44] see the the system H because you don't
[46:47] want to gift energy we're going to have
[46:49] an election here and I'm going to vote
[46:50] because I I want I want to throw the
[46:51] last out and bring the next
[46:53]  in and but he's not as
[46:55] bad an as the current as the guy
[46:58] who's who's the incumbent H so I I will
[47:02] vote but I'm not but I don't have I
[47:03] don't have hopes that this fixes
[47:05] everything like I'm not selling my bit
[47:07] I'm not voting and if the right guy wins
[47:08] I'm selling all my Bitcoin and putting
[47:10] all my faith in him there's no I'm not
[47:12] selling my Bitcoin under any
[47:13] circumstances and I'm hoping that this
[47:15] one is a little bit you know
[47:17] offsets some of the really
[47:19] things that the last guy did so that's
[47:22] that's the extent of my
[47:23] participation in of my expectation of
[47:27] the democratic process as it is right
[47:29] now that things are so so broken that
[47:32] that's the most hopeful I can be I wish
[47:34] I could be more hopeful but it's really
[47:37] broken absolutely I I have the approach
[47:40] and usually in we have five parties in
[47:43] in Austria except for one I actually
[47:45] already voted for all of them in my in
[47:47] my short life uh and I usually go with
[47:51] like now I go always with the since like
[47:54] one two years I always go with that
[47:55] party that argues for Less government
[47:58] that argues for like oh like we want to
[47:59] cut spending we want like as soon as you
[48:02] speak about like hiring taxes and like
[48:05] where can we spend more that then it's
[48:07] like oh like I don't want to do it
[48:09] that's like the amazing thing is that
[48:11] there there's no they're never satisfied
[48:14] that they have enough of your money
[48:16] right like the government's Never
[48:17] Satisfied that it's big enough the
[48:18] income tax has to go up the capital
[48:20] gains tax has to go up the sales tax has
[48:23] to go up all these peripheral gas carbon
[48:26] tax tax and cigarette taxes and liquor
[48:28] taxes and Drug taxes and all all these
[48:30] taxes go up and then they print money on
[48:32] top of that and then they deficit spend
[48:34] on top on top of that and so the they're
[48:37] they're pushing 100% of GDP plus and and
[48:40] the productivity of our countries keeps
[48:42] getting smaller and smaller and smaller
[48:44] so they feel oh well we need to print
[48:46] more money in order to offset for the
[48:47] productivity losses but they don't
[48:49] realize that the printing money is the
[48:50] cause of the productivity losses people
[48:53] get paid more to beg for money from the
[48:54] government than they get if they to earn
[48:57] money and the government takes it all
[48:58] away from them through taxation and
[49:00] inflation so like this is the biggest
[49:03] problem and and there's no one in the
[49:05] government with a true incentive to cut
[49:07] the size of government dramatically like
[49:09] as much as Donald Trump and El Elon Musk
[49:12] are talking about it the government the
[49:15] size of the government in the United
[49:16] States is so big uh you that you don't
[49:19] even know where to begin and and you can
[49:23] begin at someplace but you're you you're
[49:25] not it's like it's like trying to take a
[49:26] little lawn mower and mow a gigantic you
[49:30] know a 300 Acre Farm with it it just you
[49:32] know you're you're going to get
[49:34] exhausted before you've made a dent yeah
[49:37] it's like you have a huge football field
[49:39] and you're trying to cut the class cross
[49:41] with like a a nail Sy exactly exactly
[49:45] that's how get got that's how out of
[49:46] control is and that's why you need
[49:47] something revolutionary to disrupt it
[49:50] and replace it is there a place for a
[49:53] centralized planned government in in a
[49:56] Bitcoin
[49:57] there's room for a government in like
[50:00] you know Bitcoin rules the digital realm
[50:04] and we tap into the digital realm for
[50:08] for money and information right now but
[50:11] the the Physical Realm Bitcoin doesn't
[50:13] rule you know so like if I if you and I
[50:15] were in the same room and I came and I
[50:16] punched you in the face Bitcoin doesn't
[50:18] fix that right so we we still
[50:22] need to have some mechanism that
[50:26] retaliates against Force that's
[50:28] initiated you know irrationally or
[50:32] unjustifiably by a first party and and
[50:35] that's what we need government to to do
[50:37] and it can be structured in different
[50:39] ways it doesn't you know it can be
[50:41] militias it can be but like we need we
[50:43] need some judges we need some police
[50:46] right we need some laws that say if you
[50:48] do this that consequence will be imposed
[50:51] upon you and it needs to be down toe and
[50:54] rational not all these you know we have
[50:56] so many laws on the books that you know
[50:58] we need an AI system now to read them
[51:00] and understand them and interpret them
[51:02] because no lawyer or judge can and and
[51:04] it's such a slow process to go through
[51:07] the courts because everything's so
[51:09] backlogged because all the laws are so
[51:10] complicated and there's so many
[51:12] perceived violations which are you know
[51:15] which may or may not be things that we
[51:17] actually need the law for so I believe
[51:19] in a very small government because we
[51:21] need something to
[51:23] prevent dis disorder and Chaos of the
[51:26] being no rules around violence but uh
[51:29] and and theft but that's what we need
[51:31] the government to do to protect people
[51:33] from violence and theft not to build the
[51:34] roads and provide the education and
[51:36] administer all the doctors and nurses
[51:38] and hospitals and drugs and all and
[51:40] pharmaceutical companies and Banks and
[51:42] all all that kind of stuff we just need
[51:44] we need them to be there to help
[51:47] mitigate force and fraud initiation of
[51:49] force and the use of
[51:51] fraud funny enough this is currently
[51:53] actually a topic in in Austria because
[51:55] we have right now now uh we have since
[51:58] 16 years a case a corruption case
[52:00] against the previous minister of of
[52:03] Finance uh and it's just going on since
[52:05] 16 years and now it seems like in the
[52:08] next week There's finally decision if he
[52:10] actually was doing something wrong for
[52:12] as as a politician or not and it's going
[52:15] on for 16 years and there like doesn't
[52:18] even make sense to accuse him of
[52:20] anything after 16 years of the process
[52:23] going on so that there I just point out
[52:25] that Bitcoin is 16 years old so
[52:29] here's here's what one court has not
[52:31] managed to do in 16 years versus here's
[52:34] what one peer-to-peer system has managed
[52:35] to do in 16 years the number of people
[52:38] affected the amount of Justice that's
[52:40] been dealt by Bitcoin versus the amount
[52:42] of Justice it's been dealt by the courts
[52:43] I also like I I like to think back the
[52:46] people who knew the Bitcoin system knew
[52:48] that Craig Wright was a fraud the day
[52:50] that he announced that he was Satoshi
[52:52] right like we said where's the signature
[52:54] publish the public signature on the
[52:56] Genesis block or a known Satoshi block
[52:58] or get the out the fact that you
[53:00] didn't do it proves to us that you can't
[53:02] prove that you're Satoshi which means
[53:04] you're not Satoshi if you're claiming to
[53:05] be Satoshi and providing proof right you
[53:08] know pretty straightforward logic and we
[53:09] knew it the day and it took until late
[53:12] last
[53:13] year uh for the court system to get
[53:16] through and multiple court cases and he
[53:18] was suing people and he was costing a
[53:20] fortune and misleading tons of people
[53:22] and you know lots of people lost their
[53:23] money on it going through the court
[53:26] system so like there's something when I
[53:28] say Bitcoin is a system of justice it's
[53:30] a just system there's a lot of
[53:32] adjudication and judgment that goes into
[53:34] Bitcoin every block that goes through
[53:36] every single node Runner judges every
[53:39] single transaction and the proof of work
[53:42] on that block right so there's not a
[53:44] single like you cannot act with
[53:46] Injustice in Bitcoin you cannot spend
[53:49] coins that have been spent you cannot
[53:50] spend coins that aren't yours you can't
[53:53] earn a coin that you haven't done the
[53:54] proof of work on and if story you can't
[53:57] do it right forget you do it and then
[53:59] and then some judge you know some
[54:01] somebody has to sue you to try to undo
[54:02] the damage that you did you cannot do
[54:04] the damage so it's a system that
[54:06] prevents violation of its rules and so
[54:09] you don't need to go to court to say you
[54:11] know this person double spent a coin
[54:13] it's like no there's no such thing as
[54:14] double spending it's impossible to
[54:15] double spend end of
[54:18] story absolutely yeah and it's like it
[54:21] was so fun for me because like um it
[54:25] like like
[54:27] the the thinking of there there is a guy
[54:30] that makes so much efforts or a guy girl
[54:32] group of people uh to stay Anonymous and
[54:35] then he tries to prove in court that he
[54:38] is that
[54:41] like Sur the Craig Wright story for sure
[54:44] but yeah Satoshi can prove that he's
[54:46] Satoshi right just like I can prove that
[54:48] I control the private keys to the coin
[54:51] the utxos that I actually do control the
[54:53] private keys to and I can't prove that I
[54:55] you know
[54:56] other way so I may choose to keep it a
[54:58] secret but if I want to come out and say
[55:00] I have one whole Bitcoin I can prove it
[55:04] to somebody right like you know I can
[55:06] prove it to a bank I can prove it to the
[55:08] Press I can prove it to anybody else or
[55:09] if I can't then it's safe to assume that
[55:11] I
[55:12] don't right like if I'm trying to prove
[55:15] something and I can't prove it in a
[55:17] system where proof is easy then I'm
[55:19] trying to make a false
[55:22] claim yeah and and I think the satosi
[55:26] ship has sailed I think we will probably
[55:28] never know who who who it is yeah I
[55:31] that's my view
[55:33] too it's it's like if if we got to know
[55:36] I think we probably would have would
[55:38] already know like it it's it's too long
[55:41] 16 years it's just like uh like it's
[55:43] it's too too long of a period people are
[55:45] quite obsessed with trying to figure out
[55:46] who Satoshi is and it's and it's it's
[55:50] kind of the and many Bitcoin is pushed
[55:51] back in then and say like the only thing
[55:54] Satoshi really asked for is leave him
[55:56] alone right he didn't ask for the money
[55:58] he didn't ask for power he didn't ask
[56:00] for fame he
[56:02] disappeared you know quite consciously
[56:04] he didn't say he didn't leave Clues and
[56:06] say if you want to find me you know here
[56:08] here like he tried to hide as many Clues
[56:10] he wanted to be left alone so people who
[56:12] are obsessed with trying to find him are
[56:14] actually doing a disrespectful thing um
[56:17] and and they're welcome to do it right
[56:19] Bitcoin doesn't care what you do it's a
[56:20] permissionless system you can do it but
[56:22] to the extent that you honor Satoshi and
[56:25] you're grateful for the gift that he
[56:27] gave to the world in Bitcoin maybe you
[56:30] should just leave it alone not that I
[56:32] think they're going to find out who it
[56:33] is but I think it's a it's it's
[56:35] something that whenever I see somebody
[56:36] like put concocting some Theory like
[56:38] Jack dorsy is or somebody else is it's
[56:40] like leave Jack dorsy alone and by all
[56:43] for God's sake leave Satoshi alone like
[56:45] he he gave you this deal with it rather
[56:48] than try to figure out who he was
[56:50] against his
[56:52] wishes yeah this is also something that
[56:54] I I I really don't like when we try to
[56:57] put uh the satosi thing on a living
[57:01] person so like like all like Jack dorsy
[57:03] or like um uh I forgot his name of the
[57:07] the documentary series
[57:10] um exactly yeah it's like if because
[57:15] this puts a burden actually on on on a
[57:19] people say was halin or Len Sassaman
[57:22] that puts a pressure on you know Halen's
[57:24] wife or on his legacy or on Len sasson's
[57:28] family like you know what you don't know
[57:31] who Satoshi is it's meant to be that way
[57:34] it's a big it's a big part of the honor
[57:36] within the system that the Creator
[57:39] didn't take credit for it or you know
[57:42] put himself on a pedestal as the ruler
[57:45] right we have no ruler because Satoshi
[57:47] nobody knows who he is and he doesn't
[57:48] exist anymore Satoshi is like a you know
[57:51] is like a Persona right it's like
[57:53] Superman and he wore a ask and nobody
[57:56] knew who he was in real life and that's
[57:59] the way it was meant to be and he's
[58:00] retired now because he did the good deed
[58:02] that he was meant to do the suit the
[58:04] super achievement that nobody else could
[58:07] have done beforehand in in a superb way
[58:10] so I say just leave it be and that's
[58:12] another one of these to come back to the
[58:13] beginning of this conversation that's
[58:15] another very spiritual thing about
[58:17] Bitcoin it's a there's a and I
[58:21] think do you think Bitcoin would have
[58:23] been successful if since like day one we
[58:26] would have known who zamoto is and is a
[58:28] real person that goes on podcast and
[58:30] stuff like that no I I I really think
[58:33] that for a few reasons one is the
[58:36] pressure that that individual would have
[58:38] been subject to had it gone towards any
[58:41] level of success that we've seen would
[58:44] have caused you know some chaos in the
[58:47] system right like we need him to change
[58:49] the system people would have directed
[58:50] their attention and focus on him rather
[58:52] than on the system because he he is in
[58:54] control so we would have been ruled rul
[58:56] with a ruler right I think that's just
[58:58] unavoidable as opposed to rules without
[59:00] a ruler and we've got to figure out how
[59:01] to ma manage the system together
[59:03] collectively as a whole so I think it
[59:05] would have been very very different even
[59:07] if he was still around and still
[59:09] pseudonymous it would have been very
[59:10] different so the the creation of Bitcoin
[59:13] required The Disappearance of Satoshi to
[59:16] become the entity that it is and I think
[59:20] Satoshi knew that right I don't think he
[59:23] ran away just out of fear and had
[59:25] intended to stay in involved for a long
[59:27] time he had been prepared to cut the
[59:29] cord at any moment in time probably in
[59:32] part because he was scared of being
[59:35] persecuted uh but he knew that he would
[59:38] need to do this at the time that he
[59:40] announced it even right so it was always
[59:43] part of the plan absolutely H sometimes
[59:45] I wonder like how much he
[59:48] foresaw uh in in the Bitcoin adoption
[59:51] would be would be I think that's where
[59:53] the obsession comes from because people
[59:55] are uh thing of like oh like what if I
[59:58] could ask that person question and and
[60:00] stuff like that and they're obsessing
[60:02] with with that and I I I get the
[60:04] Curiosity around that CU and the hero
[60:07] worship right like I mean what this man
[60:09] did was unprecedented in so many
[60:12] different respects in the field of
[60:14] computer science in the field of
[60:15] economics in the field of government in
[60:17] the field
[60:19] of of altruism right like he he didn't
[60:22] do this for his own sake and his own
[60:24] benefit to his own enrichment he gave a
[60:26] gift to the world and took nothing you
[60:28] know asked nothing in return other than
[60:30] to leave him alone absolutely um I have
[60:34] one question that I asked each and every
[60:36] one of my guests and the question is
[60:38] what can we learn from you besides
[60:40] Bitcoin well you
[60:42] know depends on how much time you spend
[60:44] with with me but the thing that is
[60:47] outside of Bitcoin that I think Bitcoin
[60:49] has shown me is like we're the greatest
[60:52] treasure in the world is being is
[60:54] figuring out who you are are and what
[60:56] you love and realizing that and and I
[61:00] think I think Bitcoin empowers a journey
[61:02] that lets people go on that path to
[61:05] discover the true self and that that's
[61:07] ultimately The Greatest Prize that you
[61:09] can have you can have a ton of money and
[61:11] then look to influencers as to what
[61:14] watch you should buy what yacht you
[61:15] should buy what car you should buy but
[61:17] there's more there's a lot more to you
[61:19] than that and and it's and it's Unique
[61:22] to you right I don't have the answer for
[61:24] you and you don't have the answer for me
[61:25] it comes from living our lives and
[61:27] introspecting and and experimenting and
[61:30] ultimately being Sovereign with your
[61:32] limited time on Earth and so I like to
[61:35] me I think that's the greatest lesson
[61:38] that I encourage people to go on them to
[61:41] learn for themselves like who are you
[61:43] and what and what really are you test
[61:46] yourself in all sorts of different ways
[61:48] see what you're capable of see what your
[61:49] limits are see what your passions are
[61:52] what you truly love and find a way to
[61:54] live the best life you can for you
[61:57] that's beautiful I like that a lot um
[62:00] it's really cool we have a endogen in
[62:03] the podcast where the the previous guest
[62:06] is asking a question for the next guest
[62:07] without knowing who the next guest
[62:09] actually is and the the previous guest
[62:12] asked you um what is wrong with Bitcoin
[62:15] today which is holding us back nothing
[62:18] you know the this is you know the desire
[62:21] to come in and meddle with it is um is a
[62:26] Place desire right like which is which
[62:28] isn't to say that people ought not to
[62:30] make changes to suggest changes to it
[62:33] the process of thinking about Bitcoin
[62:35] and thinking about what could be better
[62:37] about it but having to win over the vast
[62:41] majority of the community to the point
[62:43] where they will allow a change to be
[62:45] made to it is a great thing about
[62:47] Bitcoin and Bitcoin is what it is so
[62:50] there there's nothing that I would say
[62:52] needs to change even if I believe in
[62:55] some of the changes that are being
[62:56] proposed right the the process to
[62:59] propose changes and make them take
[63:01] effect through socialization is exactly
[63:03] what a system with no
[63:06] rulers requires so I think that that
[63:09] like I'm I'm happy to go along this
[63:11] journey with Bitcoin at the pace that
[63:14] it's able to go to the extent that I can
[63:16] help accelerate or broaden its reach
[63:19] that's what I'm trying to do but I
[63:21] accept Bitcoin there's a very Zen thing
[63:23] here which is to you better accept
[63:24] Bitcoin as it is because if you try to
[63:26] resist what bitcoin's nature is you're
[63:29] going to find yourself banging your head
[63:32] against the most power against a wall of
[63:34] encrypted energy to use Michael sailor's
[63:36] analogy right you're banging your head
[63:38] against a wall that is just way too
[63:40] powerful um and is headed in the right
[63:42] direction anyways you just need to be
[63:45] patient about it yeah I think that's
[63:47] where th those people who bang their
[63:51] heads against the uh the wall are those
[63:53] who then go off and and make altcoins
[63:56] and try to make a better Bitcoin and
[63:58] improve a system that's already uh
[64:00] perfect yeah that that's intering that
[64:02] thing it's like this is the nature like
[64:04] if you want this decentralized system
[64:07] accept its decentralization don't try to
[64:10] take don't try to corrupt the most
[64:12] essential part of it for your own you
[64:15] know Folly for your own egotistical
[64:20] shortsighted
[64:21] desire really cool uh that's that's
[64:24] exactly uh right thank you so much Tom
[64:27] for for for your time and being on um
[64:29] before I let you go where can people
[64:30] find you ask your questions and reach
[64:32] out to you yeah I'm I spend a lot of my
[64:34] time on X I'm also on Noster and my
[64:36] Noster Pub key is on my x uh pinned post
[64:40] so at tomr Strite if you want to read
[64:42] some of the stuff that I've written uh
[64:44] there's two places where most of my
[64:46] writing is one is tote. medium.com I
[64:49] wrote a lot of my Bitcoin philosophy on
[64:52] um on there and then I was also the
[64:54] editor-in chief of swan so if you go to
[64:56] swann.com blog and you scroll down
[64:59] you'll find lots of my articles and
[65:00] thoughts there those are longer pieces
[65:03] um I've made a couple movies again on
[65:05] the swan Bitcoin Channel you can find a
[65:07] movie called Bitcoin is Generation
[65:09] wealth it's about 15 minutes long uh
[65:11] there's one called Bitcoin is beautiful
[65:13] which is only six or seven minutes long
[65:15] and then there's a bigger one it's 38
[65:17] minutes long called the legendary
[65:18] treasure of Satoshi Nakamoto which is um
[65:22] which is my most widely read essay and I
[65:25] yes my second most widely viewed uh
[65:28] video I have uh two books one's called
[65:31] why Bitcoin um and again you can find in
[65:34] my profile on um on Twitter a link to
[65:38] where you can order a hard copy of it
[65:39] but you can get a free copy of this book
[65:41] at swann.com
[65:43] Bitcoin wh Bitcoin and i' I've got a
[65:48] children's book called uh Satoshi
[65:51] Nakamoto and his Bitcoin invention which
[65:53] is for kids aged like 3 to 10 3 to maybe
[65:57] as old as 3 to 12 uh and kids really
[65:59] love it uh I've seen a lot of I've read
[66:01] it to a lot of kids and I've seen
[66:02] parents read it to a lot of their kids
[66:04] and tells the story of bitcoin's
[66:05] creation and who Satoshi was and you
[66:08] know and respects his privacy it doesn't
[66:10] take a guess as to who who he he is um I
[66:14] on Twitter I do a weekly spaces Sunday
[66:16] mornings at 8 am. Eastern called Bitcoin
[66:18] philosophy Sundays and we discuss a lot
[66:20] of the types of issues that you and I
[66:21] have discussed here uh focusing on one
[66:23] issue uh per uh per session so those are
[66:27] all recorded you can find them on my on
[66:28] my Twitter profile page uh but you can
[66:31] also participate in them live we welcome
[66:33] anyone to come and join the conversation
[66:35] if they feel they have something to add
[66:37] and want to participate in dialogue

[66:56] fascinating for me to see uh the guests
[66:59] that have uh done the the research that
[67:02] not only putting the information into
[67:05] their heads but also trying to put it
[67:08] out on content being in film written
[67:12] books like whatever uh it it it makes a
[67:15] huge difference uh if you actually write
[67:18] wrote down something actually made your
[67:20] ahead of like okay like how do I also
[67:23] present that what I just learned to
[67:25] other people it's always a learning
[67:26] process sharing what you know it's
[67:27] learning what you know right when you're
[67:29] write you discover what you actually
[67:31] think yeah that's a beautiful sentence I
