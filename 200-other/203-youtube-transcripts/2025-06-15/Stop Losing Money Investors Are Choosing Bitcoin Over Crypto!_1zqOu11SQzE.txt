[00:00] We let our community know that it's
[00:02] Bitcoin and there is no second best.
[00:04] Builders can understand the market
[00:06] demands. The users can understand what's
[00:08] there, how they can use it. So to allow
[00:11] our local Czech community grow faster
[00:13] and on a reasonable level of doing
[00:16] finding a solutions for something which
[00:18] is not available on the market was just
[00:19] simply so deeply attached into our
[00:21] bodies and minds that we that it
[00:23] persisted and remained present even in
[00:25] Bitcoin space. They can't accept that
[00:27] you are simply having different opinion
[00:30] on things they consider being normal
[00:32] business as any other and if you want to
[00:34] excel you need to work hard and uh you
[00:36] need to understand the complexity and
[00:38] actually our biggest wish was the
[00:40] newcomers will become Bitcoiners
[00:42] immediately and that hopefully they will
[00:43] skip that shitcoin phase which always
[00:46] hurts at the end of the days.
[00:49] [Music]
[00:52] Hi Martin, how you doing? Everything
[00:53] fine on your end? Hi Ran. Yeah, thanks
[00:55] for having me. Uh, everything's going
[00:58] well. Like, uh, we are getting to the
[00:59] real madness to be honest. So, uh, I'm
[01:03] feeling the stress and the and the
[01:04] workload is is being like crazy again.
[01:08] Uh, but the market sentiment basically
[01:10] can't be better. And it's also funny
[01:13] because we talked about before recording
[01:15] about builders markets or what we call
[01:17] bare market and and the and the bull
[01:19] markets. And you with having to organize
[01:23] full-time a conference, you probably
[01:25] have like the build of a build of times
[01:27] and then the bull times within the
[01:29] conference of like after the conference
[01:31] around August, October probably is a
[01:33] little bit uh uh less less active and
[01:36] then um May, June, April, March, those
[01:40] are the probably the crazy months for
[01:42] for you guys, right? Yeah, exactly. It's
[01:45] exactly like this. Um yeah like in
[01:48] general we don't call bare market a bare
[01:50] market. We call it a bull uh a built
[01:52] market actually as like it really gives
[01:55] us the opportunity to dive deeper to
[01:57] build something new uh to strengthen our
[02:00] position to improve processes etc etc
[02:03] and and we do the same uh in the second
[02:07] half of the year after the conference.
[02:08] The first half of a year is like super
[02:10] crazy. We need to stay like sharp at BTC
[02:13] Prague itself. uh then like uh I I don't
[02:15] want to sound like arrogant or stupid
[02:17] but like people tend to uh underestimate
[02:20] like the complexity of the event on on
[02:22] such a scale. It's it's really business
[02:25] as any other and if you want to excel
[02:27] you need to work hard and uh you need to
[02:29] understand the complexity and there are
[02:32] like tons of moving pieces and we are
[02:34] jungling with thousands of balls uh at
[02:37] the same time because that that's what
[02:40] event management is about. So like first
[02:42] half half of a year is is really crazy
[02:44] and the second half over here uh we we
[02:46] call it like build market and build here
[02:49] because we need to strengthen again and
[02:52] uh we always evaluate like what happened
[02:55] at BDC Prague what can we improve what
[02:57] was great so what we can keep etc if
[02:59] we're going to order more beer and and
[03:01] even like fun fun things of of doing to
[03:04] be honest. I I love that. And maybe just
[03:06] quickly for for the people that that
[03:08] don't know about you or Bitcoin Prague,
[03:10] uh you're basically the co-founder uh
[03:13] together with Matias for the biggest
[03:15] European Bitcoin conference if that's
[03:17] right.
[03:18] Yeah, that that's right. Like uh if I
[03:22] shall like sell like say a little story
[03:24] uh which is behind we basically started
[03:27] like 5 years ago with Matias with my
[03:30] brother here in Czech Republic in
[03:32] Austraa actually city we all origin from
[03:36] uh and we we already were bitcoiners. We
[03:39] were a little bit behind our shitcoining
[03:42] phase of of being bitcoiner. We we both
[03:45] went through through that phase. It made
[03:47] us stronger actually and we were
[03:50] thinking of like what we can do in
[03:52] Bitcoin except just holding it because
[03:54] we wanted to get more involved. We saw
[03:56] the opportunity and the potential of the
[03:58] market and and we and we loved the
[04:00] bitcoin already back then in 2019 and we
[04:03] realized that there's no like proper
[04:04] bitcoin conference happening in Czech
[04:06] Republic on like a local scale where ple
[04:09] can meet uh the famous speakers and the
[04:12] founders of the bitcoin companies the
[04:14] creators and the developers so they can
[04:17] learn from each other so the builders
[04:19] can understand the market demands the
[04:21] users can understand what's there how
[04:23] they can use it so to allow our local
[04:26] Czech community grow faster and on a
[04:29] reasonable level of doing educating them
[04:32] well. So and actually our biggest wish
[04:34] was that the newcomers will become
[04:37] Bitcoiners immediately and that
[04:39] hopefully they will skip that shitcoin
[04:40] phase which always hurts at the end of
[04:43] the days but uh and it actually turns
[04:46] out turns out well. I believe that we uh
[04:48] we cured the space pretty well. We let
[04:52] our community know that it's Bitcoin and
[04:54] there is no second best. There actually
[04:57] really is no second best and they
[04:59] understand and it it's actually we have
[05:01] many proofs that checks are really
[05:03] Bitcoiners. We we're going to get onto
[05:04] the Prague and its uh its importance in
[05:06] Bitcoin space maybe a little bit later.
[05:09] So we kicked our local conference check
[05:11] only Bitcoin only in 2020 in in the year
[05:15] of COVID. Uh it it was it was pretty
[05:17] crazy because our government uh was
[05:20] making decisions pretty rapidly and very
[05:23] aggressively like uh forbidding any
[05:25] events with more than 500 visitors
[05:29] uh applicable from the midnight the same
[05:32] day. I said like okay I got you but do
[05:34] you do you realize that it takes us like
[05:36] days to prepare it in the venue? So we
[05:40] took our chances. We knew that we are
[05:42] actually risking that we probably might
[05:44] need to pack it again in the morning
[05:46] because the events won't be allowed. But
[05:48] we were lucky. So at least we were
[05:51] basically the only ones organizing
[05:52] anything back then. We got a huge
[05:54] traction. Uh 450 visitors on the first
[05:57] bitcoin only and check only conference
[06:00] and Czech Republic is small country.
[06:01] It's 10 million inhabitants only. So it
[06:04] was great proof of concept and we grew a
[06:06] lot actually pretty rapidly and in 2022
[06:09] we uh we booked like the best possible
[06:12] venue here uh in in our region and it's
[06:16] old gas station pretty wonderful really
[06:18] steampunky so it fits the Bitcoin ethos
[06:21] and um we had 2 and a half thousand
[06:24] visitors again a check only bitcoin only
[06:27] conference and somebody actually told us
[06:29] hey guys do you know that you are the
[06:30] biggest non-English-sp speakaking
[06:31] conference in the world And we thought
[06:33] like okay interesting haven't thought
[06:35] about it in this perspective but uh I
[06:38] believe that that was the moment when
[06:39] the seed was basically planted. So after
[06:41] the conference when we evaluated the
[06:43] feedback we brainstormed what we can do
[06:46] or change with Matias and we've realized
[06:48] that there is a potential of like going
[06:50] bigger and organizing something on a
[06:52] European scale because we already
[06:54] visited for example a conference in
[06:57] Insbrook again Bitcoin only but the D
[06:59] market focused only and and it surprised
[07:03] us a lot how big are the differences
[07:06] between those local communities still
[07:07] like plebs and plebs but they use
[07:10] Bitcoin so differently. They have
[07:11] different use cases, different needs, uh
[07:13] different understanding of things. Yeah.
[07:15] Like for example, in Austria, I was
[07:18] surprised like that people are so obset
[07:20] with their phone number, but they don't
[07:22] mind KYC. They don't they don't mind KYC
[07:25] Bitcoin as much as for example checks.
[07:28] Yes. So we hate KYC Bitcoin, but we
[07:31] don't mind our phone number being shared
[07:32] because it's easy to buy anonymous SIM
[07:34] card on every single corner out out
[07:36] there on the streets. So we thought like
[07:39] hey like this is really interesting like
[07:42] still Bitcoiners reinventing the wheel
[07:44] in every small European country and
[07:47] there are many you know speaking
[07:48] different languages having different
[07:50] history different culture and everything
[07:53] which makes um Bitcoin growth in Europe
[07:56] little bit slower than for example in US
[07:59] there are 350 millions of people
[08:01] speaking the same language. So, and it
[08:04] again fit into the idea of like going
[08:07] bigger. So, we've decided organized BTC
[08:09] Prague with its uh mission of building
[08:12] Bitcoin bridges across European uh
[08:14] countries to help ple together to become
[08:17] stronger to understand that they are not
[08:20] alone on that journey and that Europe is
[08:22] a continent that can cooperate and uh
[08:26] became more orange than it was before. I
[08:29] love that. And I'm also wondering how
[08:32] how hard is it actually? I think we the
[08:36] mo most people here and and you and me
[08:38] know how important it is to maintain
[08:40] this Bitcoin only focus. But how hard is
[08:43] it actually to to maintain that? How how
[08:45] how easy it would would it be to to go
[08:48] with uh maybe as a partner a bigger
[08:51] exchange like I don't know Kraken or
[08:53] Bitbond or like whatever. Uh yeah, it it
[08:55] is tricky. Uh but I believe that we we
[08:58] found the answer basically. Uh, and it's
[09:00] a it's our expert ticket, so which is
[09:03] really accessible. It it costs only €40
[09:07] and we run out of them actually already.
[09:10] They are all sold out. And this is the
[09:12] easiest way of like coming and learning
[09:14] about Bitcoin which again helps us build
[09:16] Bitcoin bridges because like if somebody
[09:18] is thinking of like uh is Bitcoin
[09:20] something worth of spending more energy
[09:22] like hey man here's like €40 ticket just
[09:26] go buy it and you can access like the
[09:29] biggest European conference for two days
[09:31] you can meet thousands of Bitcoiners you
[09:34] can meet 100 companies in the expo
[09:36] section you can hear 250 speakers and
[09:38] you can learn so much in just two days
[09:41] that it's it actually won't be easier
[09:43] and that helps us to like really orange
[09:46] pill anyone who's interested and it even
[09:48] works as a tool for already orange pill
[09:51] people having not orange pe friends
[09:54] because you know again it's just just 40
[09:56] barrier I would I would even consider uh
[09:59] buying it as a gift to my friends like
[10:01] if if they if I would make them
[10:03] believers you know so I will buy them an
[10:05] expo ticket and let them come to BTC
[10:07] Prague with me so they can they can see
[10:09] the size of the expo section and and
[10:12] understand the complexity of this
[10:13] industry because you know Bitcoin is
[10:16] it's teenager okay but like the the
[10:19] tempo of its growth and the face which
[10:22] it is now it's like maybe internet in
[10:25] '9s so it's still like a little bit
[10:26] geeky and and nerdy for the for uh the
[10:31] newbies but as soon as they connect to
[10:34] the internet and they start using and
[10:37] exploring Google and the possibilities
[10:39] on what internet has they become users
[10:42] immediately and it's completely same
[10:43] with Bitcoin. So this is how we approach
[10:46] like uh the the plebs and and the end
[10:50] users I would say and uh we feel like
[10:53] really being responsible for every
[10:55] single one of them. So uh we curate the
[10:58] speaker list and partner list pretty
[11:00] wisely and very carefully so to avoid
[11:03] any like stupid situations.
[11:06] uh like one example of many you know I I
[11:09] don't want to meet any of our visitors
[11:10] someday in the
[11:12] future meeting me and approaching me
[11:14] with something like hey Martin what was
[11:16] that company named XY Z you had at expo
[11:20] section back in 2025 I I believed in
[11:23] your decision and you allowed some
[11:26] scammers and shitty shitcoiners to come
[11:28] to the expo I lost all all my life
[11:31] savings just because having trust in BTC
[11:33] Pra so uh it's not actually easy to
[11:36] forbid some of the companies and and
[11:39] projects actually it's it's hard to draw
[11:41] the line somewhere but like knowing that
[11:44] we are responsible for our visitors
[11:46] makes it much easier because I only have
[11:48] one name I only have one face and I
[11:51] don't want to hide myself like just
[11:53] because of uh allowing some coiners
[11:55] to come and do do some quinny stuff
[11:58] on our conference any day now or or even
[12:01] later. Yeah, this this personal
[12:04] responsibility and this being public
[12:06] about it um makes it trustworth because
[12:10] people know like oh like Martin Matias
[12:12] the co-founders are standing for for
[12:14] that and they're really hyperfocused on
[12:16] on on the Bitcoin signal. So I really do
[12:19] appreciate that and I think there's not
[12:20] a comparable uh Bitcoin conference on
[12:24] that scale with that high of a signal.
[12:26] you you get signal with like a local
[12:28] Bitcoin meet up with like 50 people, but
[12:30] that's not the same as having 10,000
[12:32] people in in in in a room. I really do
[12:34] appreciate that a lot. Thank you. Thank
[12:36] you, Robin. Yeah. And just maybe uh to
[12:39] add one more thing on top of that. So
[12:41] that was like end user or retail
[12:43] focused, but we are even strongly
[12:46] focused on uh business side of doing
[12:48] things. So we have business tier ticket.
[12:52] Michael explained it on the podcast
[12:54] released few weeks ago. Um, but that's
[12:58] it. If if you are already in a Bitcoin,
[13:01] you understand the space at some level
[13:04] and the rabbit hole is endless. But if
[13:06] you feel yourself being somehow safe
[13:08] understanding the complexity
[13:11] uh and if you want to become uh become a
[13:14] Bitcoin builder, if you want to get
[13:16] yourself a job in Bitcoin, if you want
[13:18] to develop something in Bitcoin, if you
[13:20] want to become a power user or if you
[13:22] want to meet uh some important Bitcoiner
[13:26] speakers, and if you want to have them
[13:28] fresh in the venue, the business ticket
[13:30] is it because that's the that's the day
[13:33] where the venue is not that packed. as
[13:36] like on Friday or Saturday. But all
[13:38] those speakers, all those business
[13:40] owners from the expo section, all those
[13:43] uh high-profile Bitcoiners are already
[13:45] there having a good time being open to
[13:49] meet the people to to talk and beer is
[13:52] still there. So you can have a beer, you
[13:54] can have a good time, you can meet all
[13:56] those companies in the expo section and
[13:58] they are still fresh. They are there for
[14:00] first day. So they are not tired. They
[14:02] are happy to meet, happy to talk, happy
[14:05] happy to share what they do. And of
[14:07] course, most of the those companies are
[14:10] hiring. You know, we are in in the in
[14:12] the bull run. The the market opportunity
[14:15] actually can be stronger or better. So
[14:18] if you are guys like thinking of like uh
[14:20] leveling up and going deeper into the
[14:22] Bitcoin, I I would rather go to business
[14:25] day and for example skip Saturday if I
[14:27] would have to choose only two days
[14:30] because the the cost of like uh lost
[14:32] potential of missing these days is is is
[14:35] really huge. It's it's hard to describe
[14:38] and of course I'm a little bit biased
[14:39] but like uh really choose wisely I would
[14:43] say. Yeah, there's there's an there's an
[14:46] interesting fatigue going on uh with
[14:49] like a high excitement on Thursday and
[14:51] Friday and and people are getting a
[14:52] little uh a little less um awake and a
[14:57] little less like uh tired from from from
[14:59] the whole conference on Saturday.
[15:01] Exactly. Exactly. Really interesting. Uh
[15:04] awesome. And there's so much happening
[15:06] currently in in in the world of of
[15:09] Bitcoin. Um which which makes it really
[15:13] interesting because a lot of things are
[15:14] also happening in in Prague. We heard
[15:16] about the central bankers are talking
[15:18] about uh Bitcoiners the the uh taxes
[15:21] when you hold it three years is is now
[15:23] released and and things like that. Why
[15:25] why is uh Prague such a special place
[15:28] for for Bitcoin?
[15:30] Yeah. Um just first of all we have a
[15:33] whole book about it like it's our ebook.
[15:36] It's it's uh maybe you can link it in in
[15:38] the description Robin later, but it's
[15:40] it's on our web page. Uh it's basically
[15:43] uh how checks fought for our freedom for
[15:46] 600 years from from
[15:48] defestration till bitcoin where we go
[15:51] really deep actually. We even uh checked
[15:53] all the facts with history teacher. Uh
[15:56] it's like super top quality. I even read
[15:58] it by myself and it was it was really
[16:00] enjoyable. But a long story short
[16:03] actually we really need to start like
[16:06] few hundred years ago and we need to
[16:08] understand the Czech Republic is a small
[16:10] country sitting in the middle of the
[16:11] Europe always and we always were at at
[16:15] the at the at the border of like west
[16:17] and east. We were never like really
[16:20] free. We were some somehow detached to
[16:22] one or the second part of of of things
[16:25] of or of the world and we were never
[16:28] free but we were fighting for being
[16:30] free. So
[16:32] defenestration the word actually origin
[16:34] from Czech Republic when our our
[16:37] ancestors like threw the official German
[16:39] official officials out of the Prague uh
[16:43] town hall windows because they weren't
[16:45] happy of of the escalating of the things
[16:47] etc etc etc and mostly it uh the impact
[16:52] of um Prague or the reasons of Prague
[16:55] being so strong in Bitcoin are mostly uh
[16:59] attached to our quite a recent history
[17:02] of of the Russian involvement in our
[17:05] country uh basically from the communism
[17:08] era because there's nothing nice on
[17:10] communism. It it ruins everything and it
[17:13] actually disgusts me to to see and hear
[17:16] that people are like cheering communism
[17:18] and socialism again. They they know
[17:21] nothing. It's so stupid. I I lived it.
[17:24] Uh I know how my family was impacted,
[17:26] how badly they were impacted and it was
[17:29] that bad that bad that yes we were like
[17:32] free to do whatever we liked in Czech
[17:34] Republic but it was more like Orwell's
[17:36] time you know we were uh prosecuted for
[17:39] like for not following uh the party
[17:43] decisions. We were prosecuted for having
[17:45] our own opinion. We were prosecuted for
[17:48] meeting people who weren't like allowed
[17:50] by the party etc.
[17:52] And because the communist party sucked
[17:55] so much, there was nothing available on
[17:57] the market. Even like standard uh things
[18:00] we use in our daily lives which we
[18:02] consider like being totally normal to to
[18:05] be found in the stores.
[18:06] There were hund uh hours long queues
[18:10] standing on the streets during the crazy
[18:12] winter
[18:13] times waiting to buy one or two banana
[18:16] or one and one or two oranges for as a
[18:19] Christmas present for their kids in the
[18:21] Christmas and the Christmas was usually
[18:23] the only period of the year when such a
[18:26] fruit was available in our stores at
[18:28] all. It was really crazy. And that's
[18:30] just the groceries. And there are many
[18:32] examples uh on everything like anything
[18:35] you need for sport equipment or car
[18:37] equipment or uh gardening stuff. There
[18:41] was basically nothing and it was really
[18:43] hard to get something. It was usually
[18:44] like OTC only for friends or for friends
[18:47] or friends of party. So people were
[18:50] basically forced to create and to uh do
[18:53] it yours things for their daily living
[18:56] by themselves. out of the things that
[18:59] were that they were able to somehow put
[19:02] together. So we became a creators and
[19:05] developers and uh it wasn't just because
[19:09] of of of our history. It was because of
[19:12] our needs. There was no other way and
[19:15] like of course uh the Berlin wall went
[19:17] uh down in
[19:20] 1989. Uh velvet revolution in Czech
[19:22] Republic happened right like two weeks
[19:25] after or a month after. Sorry, I'm not
[19:27] best in history. And uh so we became
[19:31] free finally, but that culture became uh
[19:35] present in in our minds. So when for
[19:38] example stick or slash from Satoshi Labs
[19:40] were thinking and they were already
[19:42] orangeu built and they understood that
[19:45] storing something like private key is
[19:48] probably not safe enough in some uh
[19:51] third party developed application on the
[19:53] laptop that it might be smarter to put
[19:55] it on like cold storage device. they
[19:58] discover that there's none on the market
[20:00] so they created by themsel treasure
[20:03] wallet you know same with like when
[20:05] slush was mining he realized that mining
[20:07] solo probably won't be efficient enough
[20:09] in sooner or later and as there was no
[20:12] mining pool present on the market he
[20:14] created the one slush pool and it's
[20:16] brains pool nowadays and there are many
[20:18] examples you know like they again it's
[20:20] against thick and slush they realize
[20:22] that that private key is is super hard
[20:24] to remember or even write it's really
[20:28] it's really easy to make a mistake in
[20:30] the process. So they created a seat
[20:31] phrase BIP 39 standard. So again that
[20:35] that culture of do that do it yours
[20:37] culture or that uh tailoring things
[20:40] culture or like finding a solutions for
[20:42] something which is not available on the
[20:44] market was was just simply so deeply
[20:48] attached into our bodies and minds that
[20:50] we that it persisted and
[20:53] uh remained present even in bitcoin
[20:55] space.
[20:57] It's super
[20:59] interesting. It's super interesting of
[21:02] seeing
[21:03] that communism that from basically the
[21:06] the Soviet oppression which uh Czech has
[21:10] gone through and how people now in Czech
[21:14] think about freedom differently than
[21:17] maybe in other countries in in in in the
[21:19] in the European Union. So it really
[21:21] shaped their fuse and the the spirits
[21:24] around freedom differently. I I love
[21:27] that. That that that's really awesome.
[21:29] Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Uh I definitely
[21:32] uh agree like Czech Republic um and I
[21:36] would I would consider Czech Republic be
[21:37] more like a part of the western block to
[21:39] be honest and I don't actually like
[21:42] dividing to to divide world into western
[21:45] and eastern block in general at all but
[21:46] like somehow um but Czech Republic uh is
[21:51] like still keeping that uh eastern way
[21:54] of thinking and welcoming people and
[21:56] being like uh uh being open-minded and
[21:59] willing to help being being welcoming.
[22:03] This is like this origin from our
[22:05] eastern culture and and roots but we are
[22:08] like uh westernized from the capitalism
[22:12] perspective I would say but we are
[22:14] keeping the the the best from the both
[22:16] sides still being in the middle of the
[22:18] Europe and uh it's really great like
[22:21] Czech Republic is one of the best
[22:23] countries to to actually consider for
[22:25] living. Of course like things things can
[22:28] uh turn out terribly wrong pretty
[22:30] quickly. It's still European Union. So
[22:32] again we are not free at all but at
[22:34] least like in CH Republic we value our
[22:37] freedom on that level that as long as
[22:39] you behave and don't and don't bother
[22:41] anyone you are free to do almost
[22:44] anything. So like you really nobody
[22:46] cares if if you are that or if you do
[22:50] that or this or willing to like this or
[22:54] that. Free you are free. You are free to
[22:56] do so unless you uh bother or and as
[23:00] long as you behave somehow and this is
[23:02] quite unprecedented world actually. What
[23:05] do what do you think young people that
[23:08] are into socialism and communism don't
[23:10] don't get about it. I mean obviously
[23:12] they never lived in it otherwise they
[23:14] wouldn't be in that ide ideology.
[23:18] Yeah I believe that it all origin from
[23:20] the education actually uh and there's a
[23:23] lack of education uh on this scale in
[23:25] our schooling system. Um I don't
[23:29] actually know
[23:30] why and of course it it's it's
[23:33] it's quite quite quite a while since I'm
[23:36] out of our schooling system but nobody
[23:39] taught me about the communism at all you
[23:41] know I I I was I was basically forced to
[23:44] remember all those names of old Greek
[23:47] philosophers and that they lived in the
[23:50] barrel you know and that that there was
[23:52] a war between Rome and Greece etc. And
[23:56] we we covered this so so complexely
[23:58] actually it was really tiring on one
[24:01] hand. On another hand our history
[24:04] lessons stopped with the second world
[24:05] war and that's it you know like I don't
[24:10] understand why because those like uh
[24:12] that that present past actually affects
[24:15] our daily lives much much more than uh
[24:18] Greek philosopher. Nothing against them.
[24:20] They they they were pretty smart and
[24:22] they they helped us to get to the point
[24:24] where we are now. But like skipping that
[24:27] communism era, socialism
[24:29] uh even like the Munich agreement and
[24:32] all that stuff
[24:34] uh on that young level is is from my
[24:38] perspective the reason why that
[24:40] socialism and lefties approach and even
[24:43] communists are still present and
[24:46] becoming actually stronger because
[24:48] nobody gave them real examples of how
[24:51] terrible this was. You know how like
[24:53] really terrible like the
[24:54] communism killed much more people than
[24:58] World War II. And that's a simple fact.
[25:02] That's not a single argument you can
[25:04] rise on top of this. But nobody nobody
[25:06] put it in this context. And that makes
[25:09] me actually pretty sad to be honest
[25:11] because again it affects our daily lives
[25:14] so much that I don't understand why why
[25:17] it uh why it happens in this way.
[25:20] Do you also see that uh the EU politics
[25:25] uh which and Prague is a part of the EU
[25:28] is kind of moving in in a more more
[25:30] socialist uh uh future. I believe it's
[25:34] pretty obvious you know uh first of all
[25:36] they are incompetent all of them are
[25:39] totally incompetent incompetent and uh
[25:42] second uh they are being elected for
[25:45] four years so their only motivation and
[25:49] incentives their only motivations and
[25:51] incentives are to be reelected again in
[25:53] four five years depends on on the
[25:56] system. So what they can do while
[25:59] knowing that the system is broken, that
[26:00] the money doesn't work anymore, that the
[26:02] the only way how they can survive is to
[26:04] print more money. What else they can do
[26:07] than than just pay more people to to the
[26:10] to the voters? So they vote them again.
[26:13] They they become a slaves of the system.
[26:16] So there's there's not there there's not
[26:19] any other way of uh than becoming
[26:22] socialist socialists on that scale at
[26:25] all actually. So um they are incompetent
[26:29] and they become slaves of the system.
[26:31] They are trying to rule the world which
[26:34] doesn't work at all and uh then yeah I
[26:38] believe I answered the question actually
[26:40] already it's super interesting uh when
[26:43] we look at global politics um how do you
[26:46] act because I think America was also a
[26:49] little bit more going in the direction
[26:51] with Harrison Biden and and and now
[26:53] Trump came in. How do you look at what
[26:55] what happens happened in uh in America
[26:58] the last few months and how this might
[27:00] uh compare to the European and Union and
[27:03] do you think in addition to that do you
[27:05] think that this might actually come to
[27:08] to Europe as as so many things come a
[27:11] little bit later to Europe from from
[27:12] America?
[27:14] Yeah, good question.
[27:16] Um I'm not an expert on macroeconomy or
[27:20] or global politics just for the record.
[27:23] Um I believe that having this kind of
[27:27] like political influence on European
[27:29] scale will help us a lot. We we need to
[27:32] we need to be able to speak freely to
[27:36] call things the way they really are. We
[27:39] should not be afraid to uh put things in
[27:42] the real context and uh to stand for our
[27:45] opinions. like for example
[27:49] uh like hold that uh I don't know like
[27:52] lefty or vokeness mo movements it
[27:55] doesn't make sense at all and it's only
[27:58] strong because we became so weak you
[28:00] know we became weak we we usually people
[28:04] are afraid to tell what they what they
[28:06] really think because they are afraid
[28:08] that somebody will accuse them of not
[28:10] being open-minded enough but like that
[28:14] will kill that will kill the humanity
[28:16] sooner or later or you know there's that
[28:19] meme but it's not meme at all actually
[28:20] it's really becoming true like that like
[28:23] good times create weak men weak men
[28:25] create weak times weak men uh create
[28:27] strong men strong men create good times
[28:29] again and and we are going in the
[28:31] circles or in the waves or how you how
[28:33] you put it. So like on one hand of
[28:36] course this is natural the humanity is
[28:38] going up and down as anything. I believe
[28:41] that we are on a peak and it it going to
[28:43] it going to hurt sooner or later. But
[28:47] like uh first of all like we shall
[28:49] became like uh free to call the things
[28:53] the way they are. We shall not be afraid
[28:55] of like doing things we like and we are
[28:57] free to do like and I I I'm okay with
[29:01] anyone. And I don't mind if if the
[29:03] people is uh blue, yellow, purple or
[29:06] whatever. But please like don't don't
[29:08] don't make me change my mind of the
[29:10] world just because you are blue. Maybe
[29:12] you shall adapt, right? Just my freedom
[29:16] ends where your freedom starts. So this
[29:19] is this is the way we shall think of of
[29:21] the world. And to get back onto your
[29:23] question, uh I believe that this is ex
[29:25] this exactly actually happens in the US
[29:27] that Donald Trump starts to call things
[29:29] the way they really are. I'm I'm not
[29:31] sure how how true or legit he is on this
[29:36] and how much it is just the populism,
[29:38] but I believe that he tries to move the
[29:41] world at least onto some capitalistic uh
[29:44] way of doing things once again. But we
[29:48] need to wait because only time can tell
[29:50] us if this is what if he was true or
[29:52] not. Let's take a break for a moment and
[29:55] appreciate the beauty that Coin
[29:58] Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[30:00] watches. Those watches are the most
[30:03] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[30:06] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[30:09] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[30:12] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[30:15] watch collections. You have the date of
[30:17] the first ever mined Bitcoin block in
[30:21] there and of course also the block
[30:23] height and which epoch we are currently
[30:26] in. I love the level of detail they put
[30:29] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[30:31] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[30:34] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[30:37] love those watches so so much. And now
[30:40] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[30:42] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[30:44] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[30:46] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[30:48] first way is you put it on a hardware
[30:51] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[30:54] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[30:57] Bitbox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[31:00] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[31:03] if you check out the link in the
[31:04] description, you even get 5% off if you
[31:07] use the code Robin. And the second way
[31:10] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[31:13] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[31:16] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[31:19] They will personalize for you a
[31:22] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[31:24] your individual situation. They will
[31:27] show you how you can secure your own
[31:29] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[31:32] enough. You also have to keep all your
[31:34] devices secure. One topic that is
[31:36] overlooked often is the inheritance
[31:38] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[31:42] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[31:44] a plan for that in place already? And
[31:47] last but not least, if you're in a
[31:48] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[31:51] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[31:53] that, head over to the
[31:57] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[32:00] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[32:03] be for the first time ever speaking at
[32:05] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[32:08] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[32:11] really looking forward to seeing all of
[32:13] you there. You can get your ticket in
[32:15] the link down in the description of
[32:17] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[32:20] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[32:23] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[32:25] there. And and I love that what you you
[32:27] you said a little before that of if you
[32:32] stand for something, people are like,
[32:33] oh, like keep an open mind and stuff
[32:35] like that. That's all good, but having a
[32:39] standard doesn't exclude um being
[32:42] open-minded. For example, with Bitcoin,
[32:45] I'm heavily Bitcoin only, and I'm
[32:47] saying, "No, I don't want any altcoins."
[32:50] People can now accuse me of like, "Oh,
[32:52] you're not open-minded enough." I'm
[32:54] open-minded. I I wasn't shitcoins. I was
[32:56] in altcoins. Uh and if there's something
[32:58] really interesting, I look into it and
[33:00] see if it's actually good. But I have my
[33:02] standard of being Bitcoin only. And
[33:05] people confuse having a standard with
[33:08] not being uh open-minded, which I I'm
[33:11] I'm really frustrated with a lot of
[33:13] times. Yeah, I totally I totally feel
[33:15] you and that's that's what that's great
[33:17] example of many actually because if if
[33:20] anyone tells something like this, it
[33:22] only means that they are not open-minded
[33:24] enough. They can't accept that you are
[33:26] simply having different uh opinion on
[33:29] things they consider being normal which
[33:31] should be ac which should be accepted
[33:33] and it should not be a case of fighting
[33:35] and that's that's that's actually
[33:37] another thing or in the present world I
[33:40] I'm not really happy about that you know
[33:42] like uh different different way of
[33:44] thinking of the same things where uh
[33:48] were points for a discussion before
[33:51] people uh and I I even I enjoy like
[33:54] reasonable discussion and argumentation
[33:56] on the friendly or even like business or
[33:59] it doesn't need to be unfriendly level
[34:00] but I I enjoy the argumentation and
[34:03] discussion on the smart level mostly but
[34:06] the the
[34:07] the community and and the and the
[34:11] society is like so polarized that it
[34:14] seems to me that anyone having a
[34:16] different opinion becomes immediately an
[34:19] enemy you know which is which is kind of
[34:22] sad like we we should be willing and
[34:24] opened and happy about like having
[34:26] different opinion on things and we
[34:28] should be willing to share and learn
[34:30] from each other and talk them through.
[34:32] Of course it needs to stay on a
[34:34] reasonable way of doing and there always
[34:36] is a reasonable way of doing but this is
[34:39] something that uh it's disappearing I
[34:41] would say and like that you are not
[34:44] open-minded enough you are my enemy you
[34:46] are not fun of my
[34:49] shitcoin that's just one example of many
[34:52] again I'm more like repeating myself
[34:54] here yeah
[34:56] and it's but it it does make a lot of
[34:59] sense how actually did um did you had a
[35:02] lot of those things already before
[35:03] Bitcoin or how did Bitcoin kind of
[35:05] impact your life and your view on on
[35:07] things? Yeah, that's actually uh
[35:09] interesting. Yeah, Bitcoin affected my
[35:10] life like on on level I would never
[35:13] imagine to be honest. Uh and it again it
[35:18] goes after the education and it it it
[35:21] became surprise a surprise to me while I
[35:24] learned of how finance work. What are
[35:27] actually what are actually the fiat
[35:30] fundaments? What are the real basics? I
[35:33] learned all of them after becoming a
[35:35] Bitcoiner because I was I was interested
[35:38] on on finding the answers. Why is
[35:40] Bitcoin so unique? Why do Bitcoiners say
[35:43] that money is broken? So I learned and I
[35:45] realized okay that there's like a lot on
[35:47] this and I become interested. So I
[35:50] learned more and then I realized how is
[35:53] that nobody in our schooling system
[35:55] learned me such a basic things like what
[35:57] interest rate is what the futures market
[36:00] are how shall I save money to my pension
[36:04] system because pension system in Europe
[36:06] in general is broke you know that uh
[36:09] blah blah blah blah blah it's so complex
[36:11] topic rabbit hole by itself how did
[36:13] nobody learn me about this in the
[36:15] schooling system so and there are and
[36:19] then there is like food health way
[36:22] healthy life uh health lifestyle sorry
[36:25] uh and more like that approach of
[36:28] questioning things and becoming curious
[36:30] again but that's interesting that we as
[36:33] a humans we are curious once you know I
[36:35] I have three kids and I can see the
[36:37] curiosity in them like they are excited
[36:40] of everything hey what's that daddy how
[36:42] does it work it works like this why okay
[36:46] how much time you have let's let's dive
[36:47] deeper on this and We all have this, you
[36:50] know, but schooling system at least in
[36:52] Czech Republic tends to kill this uh
[36:54] this curiosity in in in kids and in
[36:56] humans. And Bitcoin actually opened this
[36:58] way of thinking uh on uh to me again on
[37:03] on so many levels. So u like Bitcoin
[37:06] really is an eye openener which is quite
[37:08] surprising because it's it's just a
[37:11] internet money nerdy one. Yeah.
[37:14] Are you are you homeschooling uh your
[37:17] kids? I see that community of
[37:19] homeschoolers and and Bitcoiners are
[37:20] really overlapping. Yeah, they are not
[37:23] that that old yet, but I'm thinking of
[37:25] like the right way of schooling them.
[37:28] Yeah, it's it's it's super fun. There
[37:30] are so many uh topics that are in
[37:33] Bitcoin, but actually have little to no
[37:37] nothing to do with with Bitcoin itself.
[37:39] In the end of the day, it's just like an
[37:42] an an asset and a network. And then we
[37:45] talk about homeschooling.
[37:48] It's it's so fun to see that that people
[37:50] are like loving homeschooling that
[37:52] people love family freedom and all those
[37:54] values within Bitcoin.
[37:56] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh and it's
[37:58] interesting that it became so common in
[38:00] between Bitcoiners, right? Like how is
[38:02] it possible that how is it how's it
[38:05] Bitcoiners are so special actually that
[38:07] we are living our own bubble so
[38:09] different than the normal one? Because,
[38:11] you know, when I'm when I'm talking
[38:12] about this with uh with my non-orangled
[38:15] friends, yet they think that I'm crazy.
[38:19] You know, I I actually stopped talking
[38:21] about this in front of them because they
[38:23] think that I'm I'm just from outer
[38:25] space. Actually, you know,
[38:27] on the topic, a question that I think I
[38:29] asked since the first episode and and
[38:31] I'm still not 100% sure where I land. Do
[38:34] you think that Bitcoin will change how
[38:36] our mind works and makes us more freedom
[38:40] loving and a little bit less socialism,
[38:42] a little bit more liberalism, a little
[38:44] more freedom, a little bit more
[38:46] conservativeness or is or are we just in
[38:49] a very early group and and and and
[38:52] people are basically just uh finding
[38:55] each other in that early group? I I
[38:58] believe that those things doesn't go uh
[39:01] uh against each other. Yeah. So like
[39:04] yes, bitcoin changes the way we think uh
[39:07] of ourselves and about the world
[39:10] and it's pro it's maybe just because we
[39:13] are early you know so we will see
[39:16] actually like I believe that the
[39:18] worldwide uh average adoption rate is
[39:20] like 3.5% maybe kind of and usually the
[39:25] real peak and and and bit the technology
[39:29] starts spiking at the at uh crossing the
[39:33] chasm point which is around 13 uh% of
[39:36] the worldwide adoption on the bell curve
[39:39] of
[39:40] adoption. Uh I think that we are still
[39:43] like two cycles from from that moment
[39:45] that going to be the moment when the
[39:47] when the madness and the craziness
[39:48] starts again actually. Uh and I we
[39:52] should probably understand that new
[39:53] people with new intentions, new
[39:55] motivations and new needs will will uh
[39:58] will come into the Bitcoin and we will
[40:00] see if if this will if this will
[40:03] preserve or if if they will just bring
[40:06] their normal way of living uh with
[40:09] themselves. I don't know. Absolutely.
[40:12] Yeah. Um, I want to talk uh for for the
[40:15] last part of the podcast a little bit
[40:16] about Bitcoin Prague itself because I
[40:18] think it's an an conference where most
[40:21] Europeans go, most Bitcoiners in in the
[40:24] European and even uh I I know a lot of
[40:27] Americans actually that also come come
[40:29] here to to see the European uh Bitcoin
[40:32] adoption. Um maybe let's start with what
[40:36] what what does how how do how will
[40:39] Bitcoin Prague in 205 look like? what
[40:42] what does the people await? Uh so what
[40:44] what's kind of coming for Bitcoin uh
[40:46] Prague 205?
[40:48] Yeah, good question. Uh easy question,
[40:51] hard answer actually. It's it's quite
[40:53] complex. Uh like in general BTC Prague
[40:56] remains by far the biggest Bitcoin
[40:58] conference in Europe and the most
[41:00] influential ones. And uh what we
[41:03] realized last year is that it's not
[41:05] Bitcoin conference anymore. It's it's
[41:06] Bitcoin festival actually. It's a
[41:09] celebration of Bitcoin. It's uh it's
[41:11] empowering of the of the every single
[41:14] bitcoiner uh and letting them understand
[41:16] that we are on the right journey because
[41:20] coming to BTC Prague of course there are
[41:23] 250 speakers 8 and a half thousand
[41:25] visitors 100 companies in the expo
[41:28] section it's massive actually we we
[41:30] spend lot of time on production uh and
[41:34] again we think of our visitors so we
[41:36] want them to have fun because after few
[41:39] months after the conference it's usually
[41:41] hard to realize on the first shot like
[41:44] what were the talks about uh which
[41:46] companies were in the expo section uh
[41:49] who who did I met but what remains is
[41:52] the emotion is the feeling that wow I
[41:54] had a great time there you know I made I
[41:57] made new friends uh I had a I enjoyed a
[41:59] great party I learned so much and you do
[42:02] not need to realize what was it but that
[42:04] that feeling that you learned a lot and
[42:06] that you enjoyed is something that that
[42:10] that stays in the brain and in the head
[42:12] and the emotion is what we are targeting
[42:14] and working on. And we've we've already
[42:18] realized twice this is going to be the
[42:20] third year of BTC Prague that this this
[42:22] decision makes BTC Prague really unique
[42:25] because it's not a Bitcoin conference is
[42:27] a Bitcoin festival. It's a celebration
[42:29] of Bitcoin again. And uh for me it's a
[42:34] little bit hard to say. I'm biased. I'm
[42:36] one one of the co-founders. But when I
[42:39] was walking through the venue during the
[42:40] days of the conference and having my
[42:42] eyes open on the details and and uh
[42:45] calling the team using walkie-talkie
[42:48] that hey there is this and it needs to
[42:49] get improved because of that. I was I
[42:52] was looking on the people and they were
[42:54] having such a good time enjoying
[42:56] themselves meeting new people just
[42:59] stopping by the booths you know and I
[43:01] asked them hey like what makes you so
[43:04] happy? Yeah, like it's that company XY Z
[43:07] in the expo section, you know, I've
[43:09] enjoy it so much and uh that's what
[43:11] we've uh received uh in our feedback
[43:14] from the feedback and we heard it a lot
[43:16] actually that on many conferences expo
[43:19] section is just something that needs to
[43:20] be there because of the sponsors and
[43:22] partners they just simply want to have a
[43:24] booth and show what they do. uh but at
[43:27] VTC Prague it's it's like uh one-third
[43:30] of of the whole conference and people
[43:33] are really spending time there sometimes
[43:35] even more time than on the stages
[43:38] because that's the place where they can
[43:39] meet all the creators and builders of
[43:41] the products and the services from all
[43:43] the space the companies are coming from
[43:46] all around the world and again we are
[43:48] curating them a lot so they can be sure
[43:50] that when they talk with the company XY
[43:52] Z there that they are legit that it's
[43:54] worth of spending some some time there.
[43:56] So, the expo section is like a huge end
[43:58] nest with thousands of people moving uh
[44:02] in different directions. And what's
[44:06] important after 6 p.m. when uh the talks
[44:09] are over, we put music a little bit
[44:12] louder. You know, we open few another
[44:14] beer points. We have some fun things
[44:17] happening outside in the partner stands
[44:20] which works like afterparty places and
[44:22] really the conference turns into the
[44:24] festival and people stays there like
[44:26] till 2 3:00 a.m. having such a great
[44:29] time. So uh that makes BTC Prague unique
[44:32] and it makes me makes me proud that
[44:35] those people coming and having good time
[44:36] there uh actually works as a proven that
[44:39] we are on the right mission with BTC
[44:42] Prague. I love that uh that that
[44:45] approach which which also explains why
[44:48] why uh why why people are fatigued on on
[44:51] Saturday because I celebrate first and
[44:53] Friday already. Uh and it's a it's a
[44:56] really cool I I love that you say it's
[44:58] it's a festival and a celebration of
[45:00] Bitcoin. Uh because this takes it a
[45:03] little bit away from oh yeah it's it's
[45:06] it's just a festival. If you really want
[45:08] to work in Bitcoin you can go there.
[45:09] Obviously, that's that's there and and
[45:12] you can do that. The best place in
[45:13] Europe, it's Bitcoin Prague, but it's
[45:16] also fun like like combining the this
[45:19] business and fun uh thing. It's is is
[45:22] really cool. Um what was was there some
[45:25] big learning when you last year went
[45:26] through the conference and and and uh
[45:29] communicated with your team? Was there
[45:30] like one big f learning that uh you saw
[45:33] last year that you really want to change
[45:35] this year?
[45:37] Uh yeah like
[45:39] um for example that uh that check stage
[45:42] that we had at the real end of the venue
[45:45] that position wasn't wasn't best. So we
[45:46] are moving it uh more into the front so
[45:49] people can can really have a good time
[45:51] and learn more of Bitcoin as it's like
[45:53] European conference but we focus on
[45:55] Czech Republic a lot. So oneird of the
[45:57] audience is obviously origin from Czech
[46:00] Republic. So we want to help them to
[46:02] understand and grow in the Bitcoin even
[46:04] more again because like Czech Republic
[46:06] is it is a bitcoin capital of the world
[46:09] and we want to help those companies like
[46:11] Satoshi's brains general bites and and
[46:14] others that they are having their
[46:15] headquarters here in Czech Republic to
[46:17] grow faster because they are doing like
[46:20] amazing job for the whole space and uh
[46:23] on the conference level itself.
[46:26] Yeah, like more like there are tons of
[46:29] details. Uh the biggest one for example
[46:32] is the afterparty uh that happened
[46:34] inside um in the main main stage hall.
[46:38] Uh we thought that people would love to
[46:41] like go a little bit more crazy actually
[46:44] and uh it turned out that they are
[46:46] already tired after 3 days of the
[46:48] conference. But they they do not want to
[46:50] party. They do not want like dance like
[46:52] crazy but they want to stay there. They
[46:55] want to meet same same-minded people.
[46:57] They want to talk, buy the beer or buy
[46:59] the whatever they like. They stare, they
[47:02] stay late till like morning hours
[47:05] actually. But they do not need a stage
[47:07] to party. They more like prefer to have
[47:09] a place where they can sit, meet new
[47:11] people, have fun, and enjoy enjoy
[47:13] Bitcoin and what they learn. I I I do
[47:16] agree with that a lot. I'm But it's just
[47:19] like how I'm working. I'm not a party
[47:22] guy. I also rarely drink alcohol, which
[47:26] is hard in Czech because the beer is so
[47:27] good. Uh, but don't tell this don't tell
[47:30] this loudly in Czech Republic here.
[47:33] Yeah, like you don't like alcohol,
[47:35] you're not drinking beer.
[47:39] But that might be a problem in Austria
[47:41] too, right? Yeah, Austria is drink. It's
[47:43] actually um It's so funny and you can
[47:46] probably relate to that a lot. If if you
[47:48] are not drinking beer in Austria, you
[47:51] really have to explain yourself. Like,
[47:53] oh, I'm not drinking beer just because
[47:56] like like if if you don't drink, I don't
[47:58] know, co Coke, you don't have to explain
[48:00] yourself. No, I'm not drinking Coke.
[48:01] Nobody asks why. If you don't drink
[48:03] beer, you're like, "What's wrong with
[48:05] you?" Yeah. Yeah. It's same here. It's
[48:08] same here. Yeah. It's like the Czech
[48:11] Germans and Austrians. Uh I I I think
[48:14] actually is it Germany? Is Germany the
[48:18] one with the biggest beer consumption
[48:20] per capita or is it Czecha? It's Czech
[48:21] Republic. Czech Republic and then that
[48:24] the Bavaria because I believe that it's
[48:26] not the German spec specifically it's
[48:27] the Bavaria area uh is the second
[48:32] Bavaria is is different than the rest of
[48:34] German. That's for sure.
[48:37] Um I have one uh question for for for
[48:41] each and every one of my guests and the
[48:43] question is what can we learn from you
[48:44] besides Bitcoin?
[48:47] from me. Ah, okay. Tricky tricky
[48:49] question. Oh, I haven't thought about
[48:51] this. Yeah. Like uh I would say I would
[48:55] say that that
[48:56] like open-minded on on things and how
[48:59] how how the world is moving, you know.
[49:02] Uh and again, I'm not the greatest
[49:04] example actually here. they are they are
[49:07] much better persons focusing on on this.
[49:10] But I believe that like yeah not
[49:12] following the crowds and having uh
[49:14] having my own opinion is something that
[49:17] that uh that is worth of worth of
[49:20] learning. But again uh I don't think
[49:22] that I'm like anyhow special on on this
[49:24] level. There are much more intense
[49:26] people arguing uh the importance of
[49:29] leaving that vokeness kind of living uh
[49:32] more aggressively. Actually, I I just
[49:35] had one more question that came up in my
[49:36] mind uh uh with like being open-minded.
[49:39] I don't know why it came to my mind, but
[49:41] how do you use AI in in in in the
[49:44] conference? I just know that I use AI
[49:47] every day with with the podcast and
[49:49] helps me do things and I couldn't do the
[49:51] podcast without AI at that point. How do
[49:53] you use it for for for the the
[49:55] conference? Yeah, we we use it a lot. Um
[49:59] we use GPT and Perplexity for different
[50:02] purposes. uh and it it starts with the
[50:05] content creation uh and it helps me for
[50:08] example when I plan a meeting and when
[50:11] I'm not sure about the
[50:12] direction I ask GGPT I describe and it
[50:16] usually tells me at least something I
[50:17] can start with so it's pretty cool I use
[50:20] uh I for example use AI even for some
[50:23] special emails so I was for example in
[50:25] touch with a German embassy and I'm
[50:27] definitely not on the diplomatic uh way
[50:31] of using English So CGP helped me to
[50:34] bridge this gap. Uh Matias uses it a lot
[50:38] uh for for example fine-tuning the
[50:41] program. So sometimes and we only need
[50:44] to understand that we are in that
[50:45] business for already 5 years. So we are
[50:47] we somehow tend to look like in the
[50:49] tunal vision and we forget that we can
[50:51] broaden our our our our scope. So
[50:54] sometimes TGPT helps us to find the
[50:56] direction how things can be moved in the
[51:00] way we won't ever think of it. And I
[51:03] person I I even use it personally. I
[51:05] like to just spend some time when I have
[51:06] free time during the evenings and I like
[51:08] to create crazy images that won't be
[51:10] ever ever possible. And mostly I'm
[51:13] learning you know and I I know that I'm
[51:15] little bit behind of that of that
[51:18] craziness.
[51:20] Um, so I'm pushing myself and it's even
[51:23] on my desk here that uh don't don't be
[51:26] afraid to use AI even on standard
[51:28] standard things. Yeah, I'm doing
[51:30] something in the Google sheet and I'm
[51:32] missing the formula. So JGPT usually
[51:34] usually gives the answer on the first
[51:36] prompt. So uh yeah, so that's it. That's
[51:40] it. Yeah. And I'm learning. I I love
[51:43] that. I I rarely use I I I rarely type
[51:49] anything
[51:51] outside I rarely type anything without
[51:54] AI. Now there's always when I write
[51:57] emails even like text messages that are
[51:59] a little bit longer. So if it's above
[52:01] one or two sentences I and it is a
[52:04] little bit more complicated I just write
[52:06] what I have in mind in the church video
[52:08] and I made like my custom things. So,
[52:10] it's actually writes like I write a
[52:12] filter like all the messages in there to
[52:15] to have my style because people would be
[52:17] weirded out if it if it sounds really
[52:19] different. Um, and so I did that and now
[52:24] whenever I get an email, whenever I get
[52:26] anything or like a text message or
[52:28] anything with writing, I just put it in
[52:31] there. Like I I don't type anything
[52:33] these days. Yeah. Yeah. It it's it it's
[52:38] actually a little bit scary, you know,
[52:39] like the tempo that this technology just
[52:42] appeared two or three years ago, like
[52:45] out of nothing. Of course, like AI is
[52:47] not the new thing, you know, it's here
[52:49] for like tens of years. But the way it's
[52:52] accessible for
[52:54] anyone basically for free actually GPT
[52:58] uh is great even on a free level
[53:00] actually like really really
[53:03] great and the tempo it grows like like
[53:07] the images and the quality like you can
[53:09] you can type like photo realistic or
[53:11] hyper realistic and the the outcome is
[53:14] like boom like how's that possible? So I
[53:17] I thought that like it would be okay
[53:21] it's it's February uh it's April now it
[53:23] was half a year ago I was at the AI
[53:25] conference and uh we I saw some videos
[53:28] and pictures there I was thinking for
[53:30] myself okay so we have like two years
[53:32] and we won't be able to realize what's
[53:34] real and what's not in online
[53:38] space and I I know now half a year ago
[53:41] that it will be like not even in another
[53:45] half a year we are almost there actually
[53:47] which makes me which makes me actually a
[53:49] little bit happy even uh on on that
[53:51] level because it will make uh
[53:53] conferences events and face toface
[53:55] meeting uh more important again because
[54:00] if you if you won't be able to realize
[54:02] what's real and not in online space uh I
[54:06] believe that it will like from inside
[54:08] let push us slowly towards meeting
[54:11] people face to face again because there
[54:14] is still at least some level of the
[54:17] trust that won't be easy to to break on
[54:21] such an easy level as online actually
[54:23] you know all this recording is can be AI
[54:26] created you know and very soon nobody
[54:29] will realize I would say but meeting
[54:32] meeting face to face at the conference
[54:36] talking this is something that will last
[54:38] at least for few more years I would say
[54:41] I'm always trying um actually every
[54:44] month since since I discovered AI to
[54:47] replace myself in podcasting
[54:51] and it's scary how much better it gets.
[54:54] still it's still quite uh it's not far
[54:57] away but it's still quite not there and
[54:59] it's expensive also do like long
[55:01] podcasts but the rate of innovation and
[55:06] and adoption of AI I think in 5 years I
[55:10] could do this podcast uh with just AI
[55:13] and probably most people won't tell if
[55:16] it's the actual Robin or it's it's the
[55:18] AI Robin. So that will be um that will
[55:22] be a crazy time for for for content
[55:24] creators. Uh and branding I think
[55:26] branding will will just change. If you
[55:28] can say to uh if you have just like uh
[55:31] JPD device somewhere and you can just
[55:34] say hey I want to have dinner for for me
[55:37] my my girlfriend and and and my mom is
[55:39] coming by order something. Then all of
[55:42] the sudden uh you don't you you let that
[55:45] one device uh decide what to order. But
[55:48] if you're big brand and you're like,
[55:50] "Hey, I want to order from, I don't
[55:52] know, Subway." Weird example now,
[55:55] but never eat Subway, but like uh you
[55:59] order from Subway. So that brand. So I
[56:01] think branding gets gets even more
[56:04] important in in the AI world because
[56:06] there's like a sea of content that's
[56:08] generic and you have to like stand out
[56:10] with like one small brand. So it will be
[56:12] really fun to see. Yeah. The black
[56:15] mirrorish actually. Yeah. But that
[56:18] that's just me the the podcaster nerding
[56:20] out about marketing. Um uh really cool.
[56:23] We have an Android team in the podcast
[56:24] where we uh uh have the previous guest
[56:27] talk uh is asking a question for the
[56:29] next guest without knowing who the next
[56:30] guest actually is and the previous guest
[56:33] asked you the question, what would you
[56:35] spend your life on if Bitcoin didn't
[56:37] exist? Wow. Interesting. Okay. Um I I
[56:42] was always like trending into it but not
[56:45] being a developer. So um it would be
[56:49] definitely something technical probably
[56:51] something with automotive or robotics or
[56:54] this kind of things that this always
[56:56] like interested me a lot but I I was
[56:59] always on on the edge of like uh in
[57:01] between business and the technology. So
[57:04] it would it would be something that
[57:05] related but wow.
[57:09] Okay. Or maybe I would just become a
[57:11] gardener, you know. I I I love I love
[57:14] how house house work and all that stuff
[57:17] so much. It clears my head and make uh
[57:20] allows me to stay somehow fresh. So
[57:23] maybe maybe but without being a
[57:25] Bitcoiner that that probably won't be
[57:26] that interesting. Oh man, that that's so
[57:28] deep question. Okay.
[57:32] was I I I I probably know who that was.
[57:34] Actually, you need to tell Can you tell
[57:36] me who that was? Raising the question. I
[57:39] would like to have a beer with him.
[57:41] Yeah, you you will definitely have a
[57:43] beer with him because it's Michael. I
[57:45] thought so. Yeah.
[57:50] Yeah. It's a it's it's a really
[57:53] interesting question. uh especially when
[57:56] I also now the both of us are working in
[57:59] Bitcoin and we're talking about Bitcoin
[58:02] with friends. So probably 90% of our
[58:05] life kind of evolves around Bitcoin and
[58:07] there's like a small part that that that
[58:09] we don't have. So it's it's an almost
[58:12] impossible question to answer to to have
[58:15] it. Yeah, exactly. Almost impossible.
[58:19] But especially for me, I'm not the guy
[58:21] who plans a lot in advance as I I'm
[58:25] super adaptable and flexible. Uh and I
[58:28] don't have like uh I'm not making like
[58:31] big head of things that already
[58:33] happened. If it happened, it happened
[58:35] and let's just adapt and move further.
[58:37] So I did so many so many things serious
[58:40] and even crazy ones in my life like like
[58:43] really and this is more more like for
[58:44] for being beer kind of discussions that
[58:48] uh man I don't know I was always like
[58:50] free rider uh jumping onto things I
[58:54] wanted to do and I liked and I was
[58:56] somehow interested in I tried I explored
[59:00] if it if I realized that it's not
[59:02] interesting or important for my life I
[59:04] just move on to something else like like
[59:06] like almost really like this. So, um it
[59:09] would be something funny again. I would
[59:11] say
[59:13] like I'm I'm pretty curious if you ever
[59:15] going to know what the second project
[59:17] is.
[59:19] That that is actually an interesting Oh
[59:21] god, that that would be such an
[59:22] interesting uh question also for the
[59:24] podcast like asking maybe this can be
[59:27] your question to the next guest of like
[59:30] what what do you think Satoshi moved on
[59:32] to? Yeah. Yeah. Let's let's pass it.
[59:34] Let's let's make it a beacon and let's
