[00:00] my son's son will not even think about a
[00:02] world without Bitcoin people don't know
[00:04] it's the fastest growing technology ever
[00:07] probably still the first inning bdcs
[00:09] will be the ultimate advertisement for
[00:12] Bitcoin I think it'll be a point where
[00:14] people wake up and realize I don't want
[00:16] the government knowing every single
[00:18] transaction I don't want the government
[00:21] able to cut my whole account off with
[00:23] the flick of the switch you can take it
[00:24] wherever you want if your nation starts
[00:27] treating you badly and you have to
[00:29] escape that Nation you can take your
[00:30] Bitcoin with you with no problem at all
[00:33] nothing stops an idea whose time has
[00:36] [Music]
[00:39] come what do you think if we are
[00:41] successful what will be the role of
[00:43] Bitcoin in the future what what position
[00:45] will Bitcoin take in uh in our uh whole
[00:48] financial system uh great question the
[00:51] first
[00:52] part of how do I see it in the
[00:56] future it it's what most people like me
[00:59] Bitcoin Maes uh believe but um also just
[01:03] anyone that understands technology and
[01:05] the movement of
[01:07] Technology it marches it's a steady
[01:10] March right so I'm old enough to
[01:13] remember when there were no cell
[01:16] phones and uh when they did become uh
[01:20] started to become prevalent uh it was
[01:24] cool to have it was new there was you
[01:26] know people doubting whether people
[01:29] would would actually use this thing or
[01:31] not imagine that like people doubting
[01:33] cell phones um
[01:37] and that was a very big change
[01:39] especially when uh iPhones came about
[01:42] and smartphones came about and the
[01:44] smartphones kind of made us dumb right
[01:47] so uh but now you can't imagine a world
[01:51] without it my son when I gave him his
[01:53] first iPad he was six I didn't think I
[01:56] should have done that I think it was too
[01:58] early now in hindsight but I was
[02:00] thinking I'm going to give him a a heads
[02:03] up on technology how to use computers
[02:06] and all this stuff like that not
[02:08] thinking about the social uh media
[02:10] ramifications and all that but he very
[02:14] much lives in a world where he can't
[02:17] fathom it without a smartphone and
[02:21] a uh cell phone you know
[02:25] so um I think it would be very much the
[02:28] same in about 20 years my son's son
[02:32] perhaps will not even think about a
[02:35] world without Bitcoin it would be
[02:38] unfathomable it would be something like
[02:41] uh you know remember when we used to use
[02:46] paper for money it's very primitive and
[02:50] some dirty money why' you carry all that
[02:52] around in your pocket it's so
[02:53] inconvenient it it makes less and less
[02:57] sense so it's just the internet it's
[03:00] just money catching up with the internet
[03:03] we finally have money for the
[03:07] internet right so um part of that is um
[03:13] where do I see it as far as the effects
[03:17] it will have or where it would be in its
[03:19] Evolution maybe maybe another generation
[03:22] out my son's son
[03:26] um I am I am an a i am also in the camp
[03:31] that this is the path to bitcoin
[03:34] hyperbitcoinization
[03:37] and I also believe that it's
[03:41] Unstoppable and I also believe that it
[03:43] doesn't matter what uh politician you
[03:47] like or not because uh there's rules to
[03:52] money if you sty Austrian economics good
[03:56] money always finds a way people want the
[03:59] good money
[04:00] uh just like in Soviet
[04:02] Russia uh the people themselves were
[04:05] banned from owning US dollars but the
[04:08] oligarchs and diplomats and the higher
[04:11] up Elites all had access to it and they
[04:15] used it because it was a better
[04:18] money and I think
[04:21] that the the idea of uh Bitcoin being
[04:26] co-opted by the government or the ET C
[04:30] FS um I think is very narrow sided
[04:34] they're not looking at the whole picture
[04:36] because
[04:37] look why why is why did Bitcoin make it
[04:40] this far without the support of the
[04:42] government or your favorite politician
[04:46] why did it get here this far to be a ETF
[04:49] on the stock market in the United States
[04:52] as a presidential election topic it
[04:55] didn't have help from the government
[05:00] you know it was Grassroots from the
[05:02] people it stood on the shoulders of all
[05:05] of the tenants that made it great you
[05:08] know the
[05:09] decentralization the hard limit of 21
[05:12] million we can go on and on but it got
[05:16] here because of what it is and when you
[05:19] truly understand what it is you
[05:22] truly understand Bitcoin is Unstoppable
[05:26] so that's that's what I think it's it'll
[05:29] be
[05:30] everything that we need and more but not
[05:34] because uh of some
[05:37] politicians that it's so interesting
[05:40] because like even like governments did
[05:43] not help them governments even fought
[05:45] them like government governments even
[05:47] wanted to crack them down I think
[05:49] Chinese probably were the first ones to
[05:51] actually really fight them in
[05:53] 2013 uh and they were they're still not
[05:55] successful which is amazing because if
[05:57] the Chinese cannot do it there's no
[05:59] government government that can do it um
[06:02] because yeah
[06:03] like no no government as successful in
[06:06] in cracking down on things as as a
[06:08] Chinese also there's an interesting
[06:09] thing like when you when you invest in
[06:12] everything that the Chinese government
[06:13] has banned you're doing really good like
[06:15] you invested in Facebook you invested in
[06:18] apple all those great companies and and
[06:21] then all of the sudden you're doing
[06:22] really good I like the comparison with
[06:24] the the cell phone and you said like you
[06:26] lived through it so you saw how we went
[06:29] from landline to cell phone and maybe
[06:32] that's a really good comparison to get a
[06:34] get a understanding how quick and how uh
[06:38] good the adoption of Bitcoin can go when
[06:41] we go from um feat broken money to sound
[06:45] money with Bitcoin um C do you can you
[06:49] walk us through how you saw the the
[06:50] phone adoption where you had landline
[06:53] did you had a landline phone in in in
[06:55] your house or even in your car and then
[06:58] how long did it take you to like like
[07:01] first seeing a a phone and then adopting
[07:05] it how how quick was that great question
[07:07] okay this is like right in my wheelhouse
[07:09] I don't have to think about it I just
[07:10] know about it I lived it right so um
[07:14] growing up in the
[07:15] 80s you know I'm dating myself but
[07:18] growing up in the 80s was great time and
[07:21] there was a movie called uh I believe it
[07:24] was Wall Street with Michael
[07:26] Douglas and it's a famous mov movie is
[07:30] about um you know Wall Street brokers
[07:33] their Cutthroat their sharks yada yada
[07:36] greed is good I believe comes from that
[07:38] that uh that movie and at the end the
[07:44] main character he is on a brick cell
[07:48] phone and I mean everybody in the hood
[07:51] and everybody local regular people blown
[07:54] away like is this guy making a call on a
[07:57] beach like that's cool like you know but
[08:01] you'd had to be you would have had to
[08:03] have been that guy or that type of guy
[08:07] to own that phone because it was so
[08:09] expensive just to purchase and the
[08:11] service was ridiculous right so it was
[08:14] it was not practical and it last for one
[08:17] hour tops and something like that and it
[08:21] was Heavy big it wasn't practical but it
[08:23] was a flex right so it took years after
[08:28] that I mean
[08:30] a good five to six years before I
[08:34] saw people using their own cell
[08:37] phones that it was becoming more common
[08:40] but even then it was people who had
[08:42] money it was people like doctors lawyers
[08:47] and you know where I'm from the drug
[08:49] dealers they had cell phones it was cool
[08:52] right but we couldn't afford regular
[08:53] people couldn't afford it and Technology
[08:56] makes things
[08:58] cheaper so
[09:00] we benefit from that the silicone being
[09:02] cheaper and faster the products being
[09:05] cheaper and faster uh Outsourcing uh
[09:08] manufacturing to places like China Japan
[09:11] outside of America made things cheaper
[09:13] and competition made things cheaper so
[09:16] as things evolved it became something
[09:18] that we were kind of allowed to have
[09:21] because it was cheaper and it was uh
[09:23] capitalism right they wanted to sell
[09:25] more cheaper you're going to sell more
[09:27] if it's cheaper faster better and it
[09:30] still goes on to this day with um you
[09:34] know the the law of Technology doubling
[09:36] the chips and all that like that I
[09:38] forget the name of the law do you
[09:40] remember that
[09:41] law I Al I thought about it but um it's
[09:45] it's it's interesting because it also
[09:47] comes back to the deflationary nature of
[09:49] Technology when you found like on a
[09:51] phone on the beach it was such an
[09:53] expensive thing not everyone has a phone
[09:56] it reminds me of the deflationary thing
[09:58] and uh Rising prices just because of
[10:01] inflationary policy Jeff Booth says
[10:04] right technology is deflationary free
[10:07] markets are deflationary or they they go
[10:11] to the median means of production close
[10:14] to that uh it should and if it doesn't
[10:18] and if things aren't getting cheaper in
[10:20] this technology driven world where we
[10:22] can do things 10 times better 10 times
[10:25] faster then why is that then it's a
[10:28] control system
[10:30] right so comparing the growth and
[10:32] expansion of Bitcoin to the cell
[10:36] phones Bitcoin is growing faster than
[10:39] it's being adopted faster than uh the
[10:42] expansion of cell phones so people don't
[10:44] know that people don't know it's the
[10:46] it's the fastest growing technology
[10:50] ever right and uh when you think of it
[10:54] that way I remember the Arc of having
[10:57] inter not having inter
[11:00] and then having internet in my house not
[11:03] having cell phones and then having cell
[11:05] phones it was slow slow slow and then
[11:08] all of a sudden everyone had a cell
[11:11] phone right and you don't you you won't
[11:15] remember this but there was some things
[11:17] called
[11:18] beepers the doctors get a beep or a page
[11:22] Boop and then they have to report to the
[11:24] ER or or surgery or an
[11:28] emergency um drug dealers had this as
[11:30] well they'd get a beep we used to send
[11:33] each other codes back and forth not that
[11:35] I was ding dealing drugs don't think
[11:37] that only crypto only dealing bitty coin
[11:41] and um but it was slow and then all of a
[11:45] sudden everyone had it and then 10 years
[11:47] later no one can even imagine the world
[11:50] without it right and then and then
[11:53] adoption for internet I remember uh no
[11:56] one had it on my block no one had the
[11:59] internet and even though it was at
[12:02] colleges and you can go to
[12:05] cafes and AOL You've Got Mail was
[12:09] becoming
[12:11] popular uh people that had a computer in
[12:14] their house they were doing a little bit
[12:16] better they were you know a little more
[12:18] well off oh you have a computer to get
[12:20] the internet because remember there were
[12:22] no cell phones
[12:24] so 95 around 95 people started having
[12:29] computers more in their homes with Dell
[12:32] and Gateway and then by
[12:35] 2000 if you didn't have the
[12:39] internet um it was
[12:43] weird you see so I think we're gonna
[12:46] we're gonna cross a Rubicon where it's
[12:49] kind of weird if you don't have
[12:51] Bitcoin and and it's going to be like
[12:54] financially
[12:56] irresponsible it uh by the way I just
[12:58] looked up it Mo or more
[13:01] La law so that that's that's really cool
[13:05] just for for the viewers and I thought
[13:08] just thought about something and never
[13:09] thought about that when we look at
[13:11] technology adoption like the internet uh
[13:15] and computers as you said like it was
[13:17] first a rich guys thing and then slowly
[13:21] slowly came down uh to the middle class
[13:23] to the pool class and now like like the
[13:26] the the global adoption of phones and
[13:29] internets is really Broad and really
[13:31] down there it's not there yet I think
[13:34] there's still like 10 20 maybe even 25%
[13:38] of the world's population do don't have
[13:40] access to it uh with cell phones but
[13:43] there are more people with cell phones
[13:45] than with bank accounts so cell
[13:48] phones May made it further and now
[13:51] interestingly enough when we look at
[13:54] Bitcoin adoption it's the other way
[13:55] around like Nigeria is has the highest
[13:59] Bitcoin adoption rate El Salvador has a
[14:02] really high adoption rate not Euro
[14:05] Thailand yeah it's it's not America it's
[14:07] not um Europe especially not like
[14:10] Germany Austria definitely not um what
[14:14] what what does that do to the technology
[14:17] that is not adopted by the rich first
[14:20] but by the poor first how how will that
[14:22] change the hierarchy of of of things and
[14:25] the the the the normal Western dominance
[14:30] uh that we usually have now can that
[14:33] really change the the complete world
[14:35] order or like how do you see that yeah I
[14:38] think a lot of uh Western egos will be
[14:41] hurt as uh many countries Leap Frog Us
[14:45] in certain aspects especially if America
[14:48] doesn't wrap their minds around exactly
[14:51] what this is and how to get ahead of it
[14:54] um The Innovation and The Brain Drain of
[14:56] the creative individuals in the west and
[14:59] America specifically Silicon Valley is
[15:01] lauded and and regarded as one of the
[15:04] the hubs for innovation in the world
[15:07] right so if we don't wrap our heads
[15:09] around this and and and get a handle on
[15:12] this places like Africa in India they
[15:16] have more young people at working age
[15:19] productive age they're trying to figure
[15:21] out businesses and have better life uh
[15:25] back to the cell phones you know when
[15:27] they when we started getting cell phones
[15:30] there was barely a good land land um
[15:35] telephone system all through Africa and
[15:38] places like that you could imagine in
[15:40] more uh less Urban places more rural
[15:43] places even in the urban places the cell
[15:45] phone service the the the landlines were
[15:48] non-existent or or bad right a landline
[15:53] so instead of building out a a landline
[15:57] Network like we had in the United States
[16:01] AT&T you know this this that fiber
[16:04] optics for
[16:06] landlines right to a cell phone why do
[16:09] that we're not you know that's going
[16:12] backwards right so I can Bank the
[16:15] unbanked with their cell phone um why do
[16:19] we need to go back to traditional Banks
[16:21] then why do we need to uh have a brick
[16:24] and motor right in ATMs and all of this
[16:28] stuff like that now now might need some
[16:30] ATM for for
[16:32] Bitcoin conversion to cash which I'm
[16:35] actually working on with a with partners
[16:38] of mine uh it's operating on the
[16:41] lightning network but eventually we
[16:43] won't even need to go out of Bitcoin
[16:45] right that's the idea when I just pay in
[16:49] Bitcoin for your service or your goods
[16:51] and it's just Bitcoin so I I believe
[16:54] it's like get with the program or we're
[16:56] going to be
[16:57] leapfrogged uh by people that are
[17:00] adopting Bitcoin in this new technology
[17:02] and then they're embracing it because
[17:04] it's it's exciting man I remember when
[17:07] the internet was here and it it was kind
[17:09] of like more more of a freefor all and
[17:11] it was less restrictions because people
[17:13] didn't know what it was yet and it it
[17:15] had to be restricted and the most
[17:18] advanced thing you can see was a dancing
[17:20] Jesus gift you know and things like that
[17:24] my space page was popping and all that
[17:27] so I I think think um America has an
[17:30] opportunity here they've dragged their
[17:32] feet long as they can and if they could
[17:34] have stopped it they would have they
[17:36] would have killed it in the crib as as
[17:38] they say but they couldn't now it's a
[17:40] teenager hry getting stronger by the
[17:43] second ticktock next
[17:46] block it's interesting uh the the the
[17:49] memes that you mentioned the first
[17:52] exciting things I also noticed like uh
[17:55] when social media first was popular that
[17:57] there were like cat videos and then like
[17:59] interesting things but it was like not
[18:01] the main use of it so that was like
[18:04] really interesting for me um is is that
[18:07] the equivalent of like ordinal now and
[18:10] those meme coins is that like oh yeah we
[18:13] have a new technology now all those meme
[18:15] coins and ordinal comes out and this is
[18:17] but just just a new thing and it will
[18:19] vanish over long term and we will return
[18:21] to the money use of of of Bitcoin how do
[18:23] you see see that part of uh what makes
[18:27] Bitcoin great is it's open openess right
[18:29] it's open for people to experiment and
[18:33] play on it um ordinals are kind of a a
[18:38] sticking point for me is tricky I don't
[18:41] know quite know how I feel about
[18:42] ordinals per se yet because it does it
[18:46] does seem to to muck up the
[18:49] transaction um fees and all that it it
[18:52] weighs transactions down and it hikes
[18:54] transaction fees up but we've seen a
[18:57] reduction of that recently it's gone up
[19:00] I don't know why the transactions have
[19:02] gone up in in Bitcoin do you Al actually
[19:05] asking that myself um I didn't not find
[19:08] a nice reason for that uh but I guess uh
[19:11] there's just a little bit more um
[19:13] traffic now coming um I don't know if
[19:15] it's uh something with with uh memes
[19:18] related I did not find anything I think
[19:20] we we would see more about that if that
[19:23] would be the case and maybe it's just
[19:25] yeah we're coming into a bull run
[19:27] potentially people might just want to
[19:29] prepare for that I don't know right but
[19:32] I I did not uh research uh really deeply
[19:34] so I I actually don't know right and and
[19:39] uh I don't think ultimately it's that
[19:42] significant because 99% of the time
[19:45] bitcoin's price is closer to the low and
[19:48] negligible amount that we know and love
[19:51] and then there's like that 1% time when
[19:53] it's spiking you know look at the
[19:55] lifespan of of Bitcoin and it's uh
[19:58] transactions fees they're historically
[20:01] low I remember when it
[20:03] spiked um back in the day before segwit
[20:06] and then segwit arrived and if you're
[20:09] you're sending to Native segwit accounts
[20:12] it's very the the transaction fees are
[20:14] very nominal still it and compared to
[20:17] eth it it's uh beautiful I mean eth fees
[20:21] are a joke and hopefully they they they
[20:24] fix that but did I answer your question
[20:27] I kind of went on a tangent there yeah
[20:31] um what do I see like people like orinal
[20:35] and uh I um but that's also building on
[20:38] bitcoin right which I think people are
[20:41] doing and have done we all have heard
[20:44] about the lightning Network making
[20:45] transactions faster cheaper um there's
[20:49] people that don't like the lightning
[20:51] Network cool there's people building
[20:54] alternatives to the lightning Network
[20:56] great I think these second layer things
[20:58] and building on bitcoin are great for
[21:01] for the ecosystem and overall uh the
[21:05] user experience in economy um Bitcoin
[21:09] itself just on its base layer base layer
[21:11] has processed more transactions than
[21:14] visa and masterg guard combined this
[21:17] year something like that billions of
[21:19] dollars already and we haven't really
[21:22] scaled yet
[21:24] so you know this is just the beginning I
[21:27] it's probably still the first
[21:29] inning or second inning of a of a nine
[21:32] inning baseball game you know we have
[21:34] second layers uh uh development like
[21:37] fedy
[21:39] Min which allows uh individuals like
[21:43] myself or or organizations nonprofit
[21:47] organizations family offices you know
[21:50] you have a family a group we want to uh
[21:53] control this Bitcoin amongst us have a
[21:56] community that's just us and then
[21:58] outside of that to whatever scale you
[22:01] want a
[22:02] corporation or a global entity Network
[22:06] fed fedman uh fedy Min I believe it's
[22:09] called um Lynn Alden talks about it Jeff
[22:12] boof talks about it I I think it's a
[22:15] great thing and I think people will
[22:16] continue to build on bitcoin they're
[22:18] talking about building other things into
[22:21] Bitcoin um kind of like the nfts where
[22:25] in the ordinal where transactions are
[22:27] based on bit Bitcoin because Bitcoin is
[22:30] the truth machine it will be the record
[22:32] of History I believe interesting I think
[22:36] um with the master cut I think the the
[22:38] transaction volume was higher than that
[22:40] I I I don't know if the transaction
[22:43] numbers were also higher I have to check
[22:45] that but the volume definitely is higher
[22:47] on on on bitcoin but but I have to check
[22:50] if also the number of transactions is is
[22:53] higher for you mean the actual the
[22:55] nominal uh money price the amount of
[22:58] money mov yeah yeah like there's like
[23:01] the how many transactions were processed
[23:03] and then how big was the volume and the
[23:06] volume is definitely bigger on bitcoin
[23:08] than uh all of them but I think because
[23:11] Bitcoin transactions are way bigger than
[23:13] Master transactions Visa transactions so
[23:16] the number of transactions I think are
[23:18] still bigger on the master card and
[23:19] visas which is also interesting because
[23:22] a lot of people actually point this out
[23:24] like oh Bitcoin cannot compete with
[23:27] MasterCard like in the of course with
[23:29] number of transactions speed not because
[23:31] Master Card is just a database like
[23:34] that's that has value at
[23:36] all we don't want it
[23:38] to we don't want it to yeah H but you
[23:42] could uh uh compare Master Card maybe
[23:45] with a layer above lightning like with
[23:48] fent or maybe something even above fent
[23:52] um maybe you could do it because I see
[23:54] like there's Bitcoin then there's
[23:56] lightning and lightning then connects
[23:57] the fedin
[23:59] uh at least that's what what I see a
[24:01] little bit with with fedin as kind of a
[24:03] layer free uh and then this is way
[24:06] quicker than MasterCard you can process
[24:08] way more than MasterCard and it's more
[24:12] secure and reliable and you have to
[24:14] option always to get down to your
[24:17] Bitcoin again and save it uh securely so
[24:20] like that at some point the technology
[24:22] will be developed for Bitcoin and
[24:24] scaling then you're like I don't need
[24:26] feed anymore like it will be technically
[24:28] so much better not only from a monetary
[24:31] standpoint monetary is already so much
[24:33] better but even from a technical Payment
[24:36] Processing standpoint people like why
[24:39] can I not send at midnight to my friend
[24:42] $10 in like in the second why why is
[24:45] that not possible with fear why is that
[24:48] banking hours why do we need
[24:50] that we don't that's the dirty secret
[24:54] that everybody knows it's the worst
[24:57] hidden secret right right like and the
[24:59] beauty of it just to piggyback on what
[25:01] you were saying is we have all those
[25:03] tenants uh that are great about Bitcoin
[25:06] and we have it's a it's the finality of
[25:09] the transaction it's final it's settled
[25:12] we don't have those layers of MasterCard
[25:14] and the middleman in between the
[25:17] transaction uh taking fees for nothing
[25:20] basically they're just taking fees and
[25:23] that that's the the economy has grown to
[25:26] be this like kleptocratic
[25:28] thing where we you know filled with
[25:30] middlemen getting fat off of just taking
[25:33] fees from from the middle of
[25:36] transactions where we don't need it's a
[25:38] it's a it's a bearer asset it there's no
[25:42] uh liability on the other end and the
[25:45] settlement is final it's final
[25:47] settlement and and imagine nation states
[25:50] transacting it with each other in a time
[25:53] right now where we have uh Wars all
[25:55] around the world popping up we have a
[25:58] America looking like it's at the end of
[26:00] Empire we have America trying to fight
[26:04] for its status as the world currency
[26:08] Reserve currency and usually if you know
[26:11] history uh when the controlling power it
[26:15] that's in place has the second or
[26:19] upcoming power uh challenging them uh I
[26:23] think I believe something like 12 out of
[26:25] 14 times it resulted in a war a hot War
[26:29] right so now we have China and Russia
[26:33] showing that it's no longer a unipolar
[26:37] world uh we're going to have the us
[26:40] trying to defeat that uprisal right
[26:43] upheaval and we have the the
[26:46] proliferation of things like
[26:49] um we have bricks challenging the US
[26:52] dollar Brazil Russia India China South
[26:57] Africa and there's a line of other
[27:00] nations waiting to join bricks uh to get
[27:04] up under this get up get from under this
[27:09] us
[27:10] hemony um that that is basically when
[27:14] America catches a cold the world catches
[27:17] a fever right or the
[27:20] flu or
[27:23] covid or something bad Ebola right if
[27:26] you remember that it it's not fair and
[27:30] basically we don't trust each
[27:32] other uh and the banks don't trust each
[27:35] other and the Nations don't trust each
[27:37] other it's the logical thing to do when
[27:42] people have wars that can break out over
[27:46] who controls the money I mean there's
[27:48] wars being that have been started and
[27:51] people have been killed because they
[27:53] said we're not going to be on the petrol
[27:55] dollar
[27:56] anymore and then America shows up and
[28:00] with with freedom and freedom is is
[28:02] usually looks like a bullet in the head
[28:04] if you watch or listen to my podcast on
[28:07] a regular basis I guess you already
[28:09] bought some Bitcoin and now the most
[28:12] important step is to keep the Bitcoin
[28:15] keep them secure in a hardware wallet my
[28:17] personal recommendation for Hardware
[28:19] wallet is the bitbox it's super secure
[28:22] it's simple to set up it's also perfect

[29:14] self custody and how to be a secure
[29:17] sovereign individual in general and last
[29:20] but not least I have something
[29:22] completely new for you guys I partnered
[29:25] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[29:29] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[29:32] saw created by anyone look at that
[29:34] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[29:37] made in perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[29:40] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[29:43] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[29:46] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only
[29:49] make sure to check out the link in the
[29:51] description for this amazing coin
[29:53] vigilante time pieces those watches are
[29:56] amazing I love them so much it was
[29:58] really hard for me to pick the one that
[30:00] I want to have because there are a lot
[30:02] of great options I went with the new
[30:05] transparency Edition they're all limited
[30:08] so grab yours those will not be
[30:10] available for a long time but there will
[30:12] come new models and new amazing designs
[30:15] along the way it's so interesting right
[30:17] now when when we look at the Fiat system
[30:20] there are states that are developing a
[30:22] cbdc for example uh Euro the digital
[30:25] Euro they're really steamrolling a and
[30:28] they really want C cbdc America
[30:32] apparently is taking a step on that they
[30:34] really want to know cbdc right now like
[30:37] Trump is probably going to be elected in
[30:39] November he's like no no no I I don't
[30:40] want the cbdc uh even there are some
[30:43] states where it's already banned to have
[30:45] a cbdc so like that's interesting that
[30:47] us the USA is going a bit little bit
[30:50] back on that one then there's like
[30:52] bricks Euro China uh there's like a lot
[30:56] of uh forces trying to to get on the top
[31:00] of the Fiat game and I think maybe with
[31:04] that game theory of everyone who tries
[31:06] to compete with each other right I think
[31:08] at some point they realize they cannot
[31:11] trust each other and they do something
[31:13] they don't have to trust like Bitcoin
[31:15] likeor did yeah how do you how do you
[31:18] see um Nations State Game Theory how do
[31:21] you see uh US dollar bricks Euro China
[31:25] uh coming together and and not trusting
[31:27] each other
[31:28] where where do you see or do do you or
[31:32] do you even have a guess on where which
[31:34] country actually tries the first game
[31:37] theory attack on bitcoin I mean El
[31:39] Salvador is fine El Salvador is great
[31:42] but compared to USA and China and Euro
[31:46] Zone the salador is just so small so
[31:49] like I'm waiting for the first big
[31:51] country like maybe even Brazil or
[31:52] Argentina or something like that it it
[31:54] it's like Michael saor said the first
[31:56] country to print their Fiat to buy
[31:59] Bitcoin
[32:01] wins and I think there will there may be
[32:04] a G7 but maybe just outside of a G7
[32:08] country something on that order and it's
[32:11] going to scare the bleep out of all the
[32:14] other big countries and Powers including
[32:16] United States uee China and Russia I
[32:20] believe I I believe a lot of these big
[32:22] countries China and Russia are stacking
[32:25] Bitcoin already in in secret in the
[32:29] shadows I I believe it's going to play
[32:31] out something to the order of um for the
[32:34] next 10 years or so we're going to try
[32:37] to stand up
[32:39] technology that emulates what Bitcoin is
[32:44] but not the freedom aspects of it like
[32:49] cbdcs like bricks they need to develop
[32:53] their own payment Network to work
[32:55] between these countries they talking
[32:58] about using uh something called mbridge
[33:01] and mbridge
[33:03] will use um networks that will
[33:07] ultimately touch cryptocurrency networks
[33:10] too Bitcoin will always be the first one
[33:14] that they they try to use and I believe
[33:18] it now now imagine this Robin when you
[33:21] have a transaction that's ultimately
[33:25] using Bitcoin but there's something in
[33:27] between either taking fees slowing it
[33:30] down or hampering uh bitcoin's success
[33:33] or speed through that transaction
[33:36] eventually you're going to say why are
[33:37] we even using this
[33:39] stuff why don't we just use Bitcoin it's
[33:43] here it's free it's open it's trustless
[33:47] we don't trust America we don't trust
[33:49] xan ping we don't trust Putin we don't
[33:52] have to that's the beauty of it we don't
[33:54] trust we verify and if we want to move a
[33:57] billion do what better way to do it if
[34:01] we want to pay another country10 billion
[34:04] what better way to do it then the
[34:07] strongest most secure network uh you'll
[34:10] have your final transaction in 10
[34:12] minutes as opposed to 10 days 10 months
[34:15] or whatever it's like it's going to be a
[34:19] a no duh moment or come to Jesus moment
[34:24] where it'll looks it it looks quite
[34:27] silly
[34:28] that that that that we we're we're um
[34:31] making this more difficult than it needs
[34:34] to be so you know people are going to
[34:36] realize that we tried all this we tried
[34:39] we tried yeah Bitcoin but what about
[34:42] this too it's going to eventually just
[34:44] be let's just use Bitcoin because it's
[34:47] smart it's smarter I cbdcs one more
[34:51] thing is I believe cbdcs will be the
[34:54] ultimate advertisement for Bitcoin I
[34:56] think it'll be a point where people wake
[34:59] up and realize I don't want the
[35:01] government knowing uh every single
[35:04] transaction I don't want the government
[35:07] able to cut my whole account off with a
[35:09] flick of the switch make me a nonperson
[35:12] cancel my accounts I don't want the
[35:14] government to give me air helicopter
[35:17] drop me some
[35:19] money which will be far easier to do Ubi
[35:23] and helicopter money like the covid
[35:26] checks of $1400 that happened in America
[35:30] they'll be able to do those things more
[35:32] easily but hey Tom guess what that ,400
[35:36] you can't use it in this store guess
[35:39] what um you could only use it in these
[35:41] hours because we don't want people out
[35:43] late guess what you can't buy that brand
[35:46] you can only buy the government
[35:48] sponsored recommended Brands you know
[35:51] guess what you know Robin we see you've
[35:53] been having too many uh martinis lately
[35:58] or you've been buying too much alcohol
[36:01] you know these dollars don't work for
[36:03] alcohol anymore for Robin you know those
[36:06] type of controls this is what we're
[36:08] talking about when you spend how you
[36:10] spend how much you spend on what you
[36:12] spend um people are going to say
[36:15] eventually hold up Bitcoin looks much
[36:19] better than this and I have the option
[36:22] now to opt out of the system which we've
[36:26] never had before the option to opt out
[36:29] of our nation States currency I think uh
[36:33] cbdcs will be the biggest advertisement
[36:36] for Bitcoin ever so bring it
[36:39] on I love that uh I think I had it once
[36:43] on the podcast before but I think even
[36:45] like the the fact that um governments
[36:48] will advertise digital wallets and the
[36:52] fact that they will promote how to use
[36:55] something digital will en the Bitcoin
[36:58] adoption in itself because people then
[37:00] all of a sudden like oh I I can use the
[37:02] digital wallet oh that's how it works
[37:05] and then they can like oh yeah Bitcoin
[37:07] is also a digital wallet oh and then
[37:08] that one digital wallet I cannot spend
[37:11] all the time I I can spend it whenever I
[37:14] want but wait but that one digital
[37:16] wallet uh I cannot buy my things with or
[37:19] or or I I cannot buy it in that
[37:21] Supermarket so I I'm a big fan of
[37:24] actually that you're saying that cbdcs
[37:26] will be a major cataly list for Bitcoin
[37:29] adoption because the government's
[37:31] basically like hey use that and the
[37:34] people will be like but that's that's
[37:36] bad that's really that's bad really bad
[37:41] this is wait a minute this is bad so
[37:43] having
[37:44] privacy and uh the things that make
[37:47] Bitcoin great it's like you have to
[37:50] touch it many times to understand what
[37:54] exactly it is and why I need this like
[37:56] people AR people a lot of people really
[37:59] don't care about privacy let's just be
[38:02] honest um because if they did the world
[38:05] will look
[38:07] different uh we we give our privacy away
[38:10] for using a Facebook app or applications
[38:13] we don't read the fine print give our
[38:15] data away and all of that I'm I'm guilty
[38:19] you're guilty we don't want to read
[38:20] these 3,000 paged uh fine print we just
[38:25] want to accept and use the app right
[38:28] um but you know people don't know like
[38:31] why Monero might be good you know I'm a
[38:34] long time a crypto guy been here since
[38:37] 2017 I remember Monero and the whole
[38:40] zcash and privacy movement I think it's
[38:43] still a place for that I think it can be
[38:45] built into Bitcoin eventually to the
[38:49] same order of privacy I don't know but I
[38:51] think there should be some more privacy
[38:54] aspects built into Bitcoin uh to kind of
[38:57] um give more of that peer-to-peer
[39:00] cash feel it doesn't mess with the
[39:04] original good stuff I'm okay with it we
[39:06] don't have to move fast and Break Stuff
[39:09] the bottom base layer is good enough to
[39:12] be the base layer of money for the world
[39:15] and we don't need to mess with that as
[39:18] much we leave that for the second layer
[39:21] and um perhaps we could build privacy
[39:24] into something like lightning or the or
[39:26] the light
[39:28] but we don't even
[39:29] know what we don't know is what I'm
[39:32] saying we don't know that we need that
[39:35] privacy it's like a third or fourth
[39:38] order of understanding what's actually
[39:41] happening here people don't even know
[39:43] why a limit is good for Bitcoin a 21
[39:47] million limit hardc cap people don't
[39:49] know that people don't when they say
[39:51] inflation oh yeah the prices go up but
[39:53] they don't know know why that's really
[39:56] happening and they obfuscate this on
[40:01] purpose that's really interesting I also
[40:03] want to get into the the altcoin and
[40:06] Bitcoin layer 2 topic um I think without
[40:10] um without layer 2 on bitcoin there
[40:14] would be a big big big market for
[40:16] altcoins uh and then when you come home
[40:20] to to having layer TOS that can be built
[40:23] on top of Bitcoin uh you can build
[40:25] basically the whole altcoin Market on
[40:28] top of
[40:29] Bitcoin uh and the thing is then like do
[40:32] we need a second coin uh like an actual
[40:36] base coin I mean there's also tokens uh
[40:39] and stuff like that uh and and you can
[40:41] make even like a token out of Bitcoin
[40:43] and on those those thing um I right now
[40:46] don't see see it that way that's why I'm
[40:48] only in Bitcoin that's why I keep my
[40:50] channel quite Bitcoin only um but I'm
[40:54] always like I'm always a a free market
[40:56] cap a free market maximalist like I I I
[41:00] call you could call me a Bitcoin
[41:02] maximalist but I'm I'm actually a free
[41:05] market
[41:06] maximalist uh and and so like if there's
[41:08] actually something that um complement
[41:11] Bitcoin or is good for Bitcoin I would
[41:14] be very open to it I don't see it right
[41:16] now with it but how do you see layer two
[41:19] potentially making altcoins obsolete
[41:22] because the all those things you can
[41:24] maybe also do on Layer Two or do you see
[41:27] uh uh put long-term uh a market for for
[41:30] altcoins like looking at 10 20 years
[41:34] from now like I think the next five
[41:36] years they're for sure here but what is
[41:37] what about like really long term long
[41:39] term that's a great question by the way
[41:42] uh really long term I
[41:44] see altcoins will die
[41:47] out eventually you know 99% of them um
[41:52] there'll be a handful that were actually
[41:55] competitive and doing something of
[41:57] value see with the advantages that eth
[42:01] had over Bitcoin with the
[42:04] programmability and things like that and
[42:07] transaction speeds I think as n
[42:10] as as uh technology progresses and they
[42:14] they add things to the layer two for
[42:16] Bitcoin they'll add these features much
[42:18] in the way that you know Apple doesn't
[42:21] add the features Android has until six
[42:24] years later and then they show up and
[42:26] they kind of act like they invented slow
[42:28] motion video right get it here folks we
[42:32] we invented slow motion video and
[42:34] widgets it took them like 10 years to
[42:36] put widgets on there but it's something
[42:39] that but when they do do these things
[42:41] when Google when for
[42:44] example uh do you remember
[42:47] Clubhouse yes it was the the spaces uh
[42:51] uh that was SPAC is now on Twitter was
[42:53] Clubhouse yeah it's where's Clubhouse
[42:56] now
[42:58] you did that's my point like where's
[43:01] Vine now uh what has what has Tik Tock
[43:05] made everyone else in the space do have
[43:09] shorts and videos on all apps even
[43:12] Twitter now has like a video feed of
[43:15] shorts like Tik Tock does right and kind
[43:19] of when when a lot of these companies
[43:22] being built because they are tech
[43:24] companies they're not like Bitcoin
[43:26] there's only one Bitcoin Point these are
[43:28] tech companies 90% of companies fail in
[43:32] the first 5 years what makes you think
[43:34] these crypto scam companies are any
[43:37] different they're going to be at a
[43:39] higher clip like 99% right uh point is
[43:43] you might have a coin out that's doing
[43:46] its Clubhouse thing right now if it's
[43:50] smart and if it's really good and if
[43:53] that thing was really adding something
[43:55] to the space that can be bu
[43:58] on layer 2 on bitcoin on the standard
[44:02] why you know and eventually it will be
[44:04] like that you know I remember when the
[44:07] phones back to the cell phone analogy
[44:09] phones were uh people were trying things
[44:12] all different types shapes I had the
[44:14] sidekick it would flip out it was cool
[44:17] it had the keypad on it people were
[44:20] experimenting with things now you know
[44:23] nine out of 10 phones look like a brick
[44:25] look like the the the regular
[44:28] iPhone candy bar copy right um if it's
[44:33] good it'll be adopted in and these
[44:35] things like uh the clubhouse or to to
[44:38] say like a altcoin variant I do think
[44:41] eth will stick around though I think eth
[44:45] will benefit from this what I just said
[44:48] all the advancements of
[44:50] Solana eventually eth will adopt and
[44:54] accelerate I think it it it uh they'll
[44:58] share the space like Pepsi and cola does
[45:01] Cola is the king and Pepsi does have a
[45:04] large market share and and everybody
[45:07] else fights for the rest of the scraps
[45:09] like that now with Bitcoin Bitcoin there
[45:12] there is no competition for Bitcoin what
[45:15] it's here to do it's here to be the
[45:17] money fix the money uh there's no
[45:19] competition for that it's one of one
[45:22] they they want to sell us this is a
[45:25] bigger better faster Bitcoin
[45:28] I think I think people have been
[45:29] catching on to that now because in
[45:32] 2017 that
[45:34] was we fell for it you know what I mean
[45:38] like uh xrp I'm not I'm not ising on xrp
[45:42] full disclosure you know I have invested
[45:45] previously in
[45:47] xrp but am I adding to to my xrp stash
[45:51] no no because uh it's just not doing
[45:57] what I see Bitcoin is here to do the the
[45:59] the significance of what Bitcoin is here
[46:01] to do it's to change the world it's and
[46:05] it's change the financial system we need
[46:08] something that doesn't have a throat to
[46:10] choke a neck to choke like Brad Garling
[46:13] house and the Ripple team which I think
[46:14] are very I think they have an excellent
[46:17] staff which which has just been proven
[46:20] their team defeated the SEC very
[46:24] handedly um they couldn't compete with
[46:27] the the squad at the Ripple but that's
[46:29] just their team being a great tech
[46:31] company being ahead of the game for for
[46:33] the regulations and all that they'll
[46:36] never uh make xrp or Ripple what Bitcoin
[46:39] is because Satoshi made way he gave it
[46:43] away then he went away right these guys
[46:48] aren't going away because they want to
[46:49] make money everybody that starts a new
[46:51] coin they're here to make money
[46:54] bitcoin's here for the people for the
[46:56] world
[46:57] so uh if we're smart we'll be building
[47:01] on bitcoin all these new ideas maybe
[47:03] they'll be tested out on the altcoin
[47:06] scene because a lot of creativity and
[47:08] Innovation happens there you can't deny
[47:12] that eventually eventually if it's worth
[47:15] it it'll be adopted by the big boy
[47:20] Bitcoin you know that's how I see
[47:22] it it's really interesting for me all
[47:25] the ALCO topic um
[47:27] how do you see the eeve switch from
[47:30] proof of work to proof of stake I I I've
[47:32] seen and I just looked at it right now
[47:34] also again to to confirm it um since
[47:37] they switched they actually went down
[47:38] 50% when you measured in Bitcoin uh
[47:41] which was an interesting thing U was
[47:44] that a was that a good move I mean now
[47:46] they are not compared to to bitcoin
[47:48] anymore because like there's like not
[47:50] even a little bit of similarities to
[47:52] bitcoin except they use cryptography but
[47:55] a lot of technologist used that um how
[47:58] do you see see that since they switched
[48:01] from Pro of stake that they actually
[48:03] went down I think it was in the middle
[48:05] of 2022 or something like that they
[48:06] switched and since then they went around
[48:08] 50% down uh against Bitcoin I think if
[48:12] uh eth looked at themselves objectively
[48:16] and honestly they might say we made a
[48:19] boo
[48:19] boo we made a boo boo and but if they
[48:24] were being consistency biased
[48:27] and saying we made the right choice
[48:29] things just have to pan out well we're
[48:31] seeing how it pans out be honest proof
[48:34] of work is a is a connection to
[48:37] physicality reality and proof of stake
[48:40] is the virtual world where you can do
[48:44] anything as if we're in one of those AI
[48:46] videos where the peacock becomes the
[48:48] rocket and the rocket becomes you like
[48:51] it's like hallucinating and you can roll
[48:53] back whatever you want and there's like
[48:56] uh aggre and collection of power to
[48:59] certain stakeholders you have the most
[49:01] stake in it then you have the most power
[49:04] that's against the whole point so you
[49:07] can't even use the features of uh
[49:10] staking and stuff like that on a in a
[49:12] ethereum ETF so many people will have
[49:17] their ethereum ETFs and not be able to
[49:19] benefit from the the staking and and
[49:22] gain some annual percentage from the
[49:24] staking rewards like it's it's locked up
[49:27] and unavailable for you to get the
[49:30] benefit um from staking so um I'm not a
[49:34] big eth hater I just hate when people
[49:37] compare anything to bitcoin so you know
[49:41] more power to those guys uh maybe proof
[49:44] of stake works for what they're trying
[49:46] to do but please don't come over here
[49:49] saying you're the super ultra Ultra hard
[49:52] money no Bitcoin is the ultra hard money
[49:56] and uh uh maybe you're the the world
[49:59] computer as you guys started out to be I
[50:03] I don't know I don't know where ethereum
[50:05] goes but I kind of use ethereum as a
[50:08] proxy for the whole altcoin
[50:10] market right um I I tell people that if
[50:15] they're just getting into crypto first
[50:17] understand Bitcoin if you don't
[50:18] understand that don't move forward don't
[50:20] pass go don't collect $200 till you
[50:23] understand Bitcoin understand what it's
[50:25] here to do and then you can kind of if
[50:27] you want to uh delve into the poop
[50:32] coinery eth is one of the Blue Chip poop
[50:35] coins right so uh I think it represents
[50:40] the Innovation and the ideas and people
[50:43] are trying to do new things via
[50:46] Avalanche via cardano VIA all these
[50:50] layer 2
[50:51] salana
[50:53] um if it's working that great I think e
[50:56] ethereum will adopt it
[50:59] eventually their consensus algorithm
[51:02] needs to be
[51:04] restructured thing on that order H bar
[51:08] whisper
[51:09] protocol I don't know but none of these
[51:12] things have anything to do with what's
[51:14] going on in the true real world where
[51:17] it's proof of work and
[51:20] Bitcoin I think it was a mistake uh but
[51:23] maybe it was beneficial to what their
[51:26] objetive are I I think so because then
[51:30] it's it's uh for me it's proof of stake
[51:33] is just like a stock uh like what does
[51:35] proof of stake mean you have to prove
[51:37] that you have a stake in in eeve so like
[51:39] in in stocks when you have a majority in
[51:43] stocks you can also dictate better what
[51:45] uh what you can do so like it's it's
[51:47] very similar to to what we have with
[51:50] with stocks like it's a proof of you're
[51:51] a majority shareholder right so you have
[51:54] some stay in the stay in the boardroom
[51:56] and all that no we don't have that in
[51:58] the in the Bitcoin world so I totally
[52:01] agree and and and and the staking
[52:05] rewards are kind of like dividends like
[52:09] for me like because you are basically
[52:12] because eeve has to make somehow a cash
[52:15] flow and and and to to make the the
[52:17] staking and everything go good but yeah
[52:19] it's an interesting topic for me I I I
[52:22] cover it less and less altcoins I feel
[52:24] like less and less are really interested
[52:25] in in in that topic but every once in a
[52:27] while I think it's interesting to to
[52:30] make sure to cover the difference
[52:33] between Bitcoin and all the altcoins and
[52:36] and see what's going on and I was
[52:38] completely in altcoin some at some point
[52:40] was like Hey like there's this and
[52:42] there's that but this was just a short
[52:44] phase and then I went all in in Bitcoin
[52:46] and came a very toxic Bitcoin Maxi then
[52:49] I went a little bit back again and was
[52:51] like okay like they might have a
[52:54] Marketplace like I don't care I'm a
[52:56] Market maximal list if if there's
[53:00] actually a place for ethereum and Solana
[53:02] and all the other other altcoins then
[53:05] there will be a place like the free
[53:06] market will let them die or let them
[53:10] stay like people will not give them
[53:12] money long term if this does not make
[53:15] sense so shortterm everything can happen
[53:17] and long term the the free market
[53:20] referee will will will uh sort out what
[53:23] has value and what not and uh I'm
[53:26] feeling very safe and very good with
[53:28] Bitcoin uh I would not feel safe if I
[53:31] have a lot of money in ethereum or
[53:33] salana um but every everyone's money is
[53:36] everyone's Choice like they can do
[53:38] whatever they want and please to do I
[53:40] had a German Tik Tok Channel at some
[53:43] point actually it got I think to 3,000
[53:45] subscribers or something like that and I
[53:47] had a popular saying uh at the end of
[53:50] the thing because I always wanted to
[53:52] make sure that people don't invest just
[53:55] because I say something and was with
[53:56] stocks and and altcoins and everything
[53:58] like that in the end of the video I
[54:00] always said like d which means your
[54:04] money your decision in English so and
[54:07] and I like that like uh we we should not
[54:10] tell anyone what to do with money I can
[54:12] tell someone what I do with my money uh
[54:16] but it's it's your money it's your
[54:18] decision it's your life and money is
[54:20] your life's energy like who am I to
[54:22] decide what you do with your life's
[54:24] energy and I think free Market
[54:26] maximalism is is the it's the thing that
[54:29] I I love to do but it h it just happens
[54:31] to be that because I'm a free market
[54:34] maximum list I'm right now also a
[54:36] Bitcoin maximum list but maybe I'm going
[54:38] back to stocks maybe I'm investing real
[54:40] estate I don't know probably not but
[54:42] maybe I don't know
[54:45] um one one uh topic I want to cover also
[54:48] with you um you said you grew up in the
[54:51] 980s where when were you born was
[54:55] 9 yeah I was I was a 80s baby actually
[54:59] born in the late 70s so uh I grew up in
[55:04] the 80s I remember Michael Jackson
[55:06] Madonna and all that stuff like
[55:08] that RoboCop I I bring I bring them up
[55:12] because my dad actually was born in
[55:16] 1971 exactly 1971 with with NI gold and
[55:21] stuff like that right yeah exactly and I
[55:23] always say like um I think my dad will
[55:27] outlive a fear dominant world like I
[55:30] think the fear dominant world uh will
[55:33] will die off before my my dad will die
[55:36] off I mean there are like a lot of
[55:37] factors in that I hope it goes good I'm
[55:41] not saying that Fe will die off I'm just
[55:43] saying the fat dominant world like that
[55:48] fed might be still around at some point
[55:50] like maybe there's like government money
[55:52] that you have to use for taxes or
[55:54] something like that but something else
[55:56] will be more dominant and I think
[55:58] Bitcoin is at something else before he
[56:00] dies H and I I really hope that and
[56:03] that's what I'm also like I'm talking
[56:04] with my dad sometimes about that topic A
[56:06] Lot H I want to ask you Al the question
[56:10] you basically were witnessing in your
[56:14] life till now how fear progresses and
[56:18] progresses and progresses and money
[56:19] printing is more and more and more uh I
[56:22] mean I think Switzerland was the last uh
[56:24] country which went off uh a completed
[56:27] gold standard I think in 980s or so I I
[56:30] I don't know the date exactly but it was
[56:32] the last country and how did you um in
[56:36] your life see the fear world going up
[56:39] what did you see what maybe was
[56:42] different when you were a teenager or a
[56:44] child uh to what what you see now I mean
[56:48] obviously technology advanced a lot but
[56:51] do you see some difference in uh in in
[56:53] the people you also said something
[56:55] interesting when we talked about
[56:56] smartphones you said like the iPhone
[56:57] made us dummer um is is that all playing
[57:00] with that that feat World well you got
[57:03] to realize part of the being in the Fiat
[57:05] world and growing up at that time is
[57:07] they don't want you to understand the
[57:09] principles of money they don't want you
[57:12] to understand that taxation is theft
[57:16] they don't want you to know that
[57:17] inflation is a silent
[57:20] tax you know uh so they try to do it
[57:23] slowly as much as they can and boy you
[57:26] the frog but now you cannot taper a
[57:29] Ponzi scheme which is what I've learned
[57:32] after the the course of time
[57:35] passing and uh first of all back in
[57:38] those days you know I I was young so the
[57:43] most Stark thing is what any any old guy
[57:46] say back in my day this you used to only
[57:48] cost a nickel
[57:51] right but um what we're seeing now is
[57:55] that it it's it's happening
[57:58] faster and we we're like wait a minute
[58:00] we're not supposed to be like
[58:02] Argentina wait a minute we're not
[58:05] supposed to be like Zimbabwe it's not
[58:07] that extreme but you get my point uh
[58:10] about five years ago uh I started
[58:13] traveling more and I would come back to
[58:16] America and I would have price shock
[58:19] like I don't know this place but it was
[58:21] kind of like you know I just come from
[58:23] Colombia or I come from Brazil or I come
[58:25] from
[58:26] I come back and I'm like a $20
[58:28] cheeseburger what is this like and
[58:32] they're like yeah why you being so
[58:35] cheap I'm like what so and then now fast
[58:39] forward five years later and then my
[58:41] cousins and all my friends are kind of
[58:43] saying they're like Khalif was right
[58:44] like this is crazy eggs are this and you
[58:47] know I can't afford to go to a grocery
[58:49] store and you can have less in your cart
[58:52] for the same amount of of money so I
[58:55] think people kind of like hm what is
[58:58] that what what exactly is that because
[59:02] you know why are these prices going up
[59:04] but my wages have not kept up with the
[59:07] prices going up or inflation so I think
[59:10] the very practical things than the
[59:13] theoretical and the the high ideas the
[59:17] very practical things that you get less
[59:20] for the same amount of money or even
[59:22] more money now nowadays and it's
[59:26] happening faster and faster and that's
[59:28] one of the things that's going to
[59:31] imprint upon people bitcoin's worth you
[59:35] know it's it's it's sad to say because
[59:38] to me the price of Bitcoin is the least
[59:41] interesting thing but it's the sexiest
[59:43] thing so it's kind of like the hot girl
[59:46] in the room she gets all the attention
[59:50] right but when you talk to her not much
[59:53] going on there but the price right but
[59:55] there's so much going on in Bitcoin
[59:58] social economically the way we interact
[60:02] with each other the idea of what is
[60:04] money what is real hard money what is
[60:07] something the idea of like Bitcoin being
[60:09] pure money engineered to be money what
[60:11] if we had that idea for government pure
[60:15] government pure
[60:17] schools pure churches where you don't
[60:20] have to ow ladies money what she gives
[60:24] to the church instead of giving to
[60:27] Medicine Man to save her life you know
[60:30] how about pure uh system you see my
[60:34] point and the these these things start
[60:36] to proliferate in into the world and I
[60:38] think it's beneficial overall when we
[60:42] start to to see why Bitcoin is here that
[60:45] and it's just like I applaud you um
[60:48] interviewing a Bitcoin every day because
[60:50] we all come at it from slightly
[60:52] different angles right I'm from North
[60:56] New Jersey is where I'm from and a lot
[60:59] of people in that underprivileged
[61:02] neighborhood can use something like that
[61:05] like Bitcoin can use something like
[61:07] Bitcoin to to to lift them up and um
[61:11] have generational wealth where they can
[61:14] okay it took Grandpa to save this much
[61:17] uh Bitcoin and his son and he gave it to
[61:20] his son like one would give a house to
[61:23] their son inherited and they add to the
[61:27] pile and that pile is becoming
[61:29] increasingly more
[61:31] valuable and not unlike a house you can
[61:34] take it wherever you want if your if
[61:36] your nation starts treating you badly
[61:39] and you have to escape that Nation or
[61:42] what have you you can take your Bitcoin
[61:44] with you with no problem at all as
[61:47] opposed to having a house you're stuck
[61:48] with you have to sell it it's a bunch of
[61:50] red tape legal restrictions and all and
[61:54] the government can just straight up
[61:55] confiscate ated from you as well so uh
[61:58] there's so many benefits and beneficial
[62:01] uh attributes to bitcoin I think simply
[62:05] doing what you do doing what I try to do
[62:08] educate people why Bitcoin and things
[62:11] will become more and more clear slowly I
[62:15] applaud what's going on in uh El
[62:18] Salvador uh they they're teaching the
[62:20] kids from a very young age 6 years old 7
[62:24] years old 8 years old
[62:26] what Bitcoin is they have lessons geared
[62:28] towards their age level all the way up
[62:31] to adulthood I think that's brilliant I
[62:34] think that's um the thing that was
[62:36] missing when I was a kid they didn't
[62:38] have that in school teaching us about
[62:40] money what is money why things should be
[62:45] why money should be scarce like gold all
[62:47] the good properties of gold that was
[62:49] built upon and made better by Bitcoin we
[62:52] didn't learn that stuff I didn't know
[62:54] anything about that you know you know so
[62:56] I think the education and things that
[62:58] you do and what I try to do I think
[63:00] together will will win man I think we'll
[63:04] win the the Nothing Stops an i an idea
[63:08] whose time has
[63:10] come do you see any major obstacles to
[63:13] that like you you say you're we're
[63:15] winning but do you see any challenges
[63:17] leading up to that Bitcoin standard sure
[63:20] the people that are in power uh don't
[63:22] want to relinquish that power why would
[63:24] they if you are in control why would you
[63:26] give up and relinquish that control
[63:28] that's the number one thing uh old guys
[63:31] that are in the space older guys that
[63:33] are in the space that are from the
[63:35] traditional Finance
[63:36] system uh that are in Bitcoin now even
[63:40] they would say like you know their peers
[63:42] they just don't get it they don't want
[63:43] to learn a new thing or they're you know
[63:45] they're billionaires why would they want
[63:47] to change what's working clearly for
[63:50] them they're in the top one 0.00001%
[63:55] why Rock the Boat why change it why
[63:58] didn't Warren Buffett who I love I love
[64:01] the guy but he calls Bitcoin rat poison
[64:04] Square I would love if he understood it
[64:07] but what's his
[64:09] incentives I'll use a phrase from
[64:12] Buffett himself he says show me the
[64:13] incentives and I'll show you the
[64:16] outcomes he doesn't have a real
[64:18] incentive to know Bitcoin because uh
[64:20] let's be honest he doesn't have that
[64:22] much time left here on this Earth
[64:26] but his grandson might be very
[64:28] interested so I have one two more
[64:31] questions for you uh that I'd ask every
[64:33] one of my guests first question is what
[64:35] can we learn from you besides all the
[64:38] things that we already talked about on
[64:39] the
[64:40] podcast you could learn from me my
[64:43] personal Journey it's not unlike uh many
[64:48] people that I talk to uh I try to talk
[64:51] to people like in a very practical plain
[64:55] sense on why Bitcoin there's all these
[64:58] high ideas about why it's great but at
[65:01] the end of the day it's about saving
[65:03] your life's energy and time and not
[65:06] being de de devalued by somebody you
[65:09] didn't vote for or ask for them to do
[65:13] this it's just being done to you so um
[65:17] for me the real man's touch to
[65:21] bitcoin um I love it you can learn how
[65:24] to Freestyle too if you want a freestyle
[65:28] session really good perfect then uh we
[65:32] have one more thing uh our end routine
[65:35] where the previous guest is asking a
[65:36] question for the next guest without
[65:38] knowing who the next guest actually is
[65:40] your question from the previous guest uh
[65:43] is what is your plan if [ __ ] hits the
[65:47] fan where would you go within three days
[65:49] so the question is like if your country
[65:52] does something where you feel threatened
[65:54] in your freedom
[65:56] um wherever you are right now where
[65:58] would you go do you have a plan where
[66:01] you can execute like in three days where
[66:03] would I go and then how is your plan
[66:06] looking for that or do you do you think
[66:08] it's important to have a plan like that
[66:10] you should have a plan like that you
[66:11] should have a uh second and third
[66:15] passport in case your country tries to
[66:18] stop you from leaving some you know
[66:21] leaving wherever you are and all that
[66:23] because you could they could just cut
[66:24] you dead in the water
[66:26] you should be able to um cut your ties
[66:31] to everything because some people have
[66:33] families and they're entrenched and they
[66:34] have houses and they have lives right
[66:37] but you need to think about that I think
[66:39] we're coming to the days and the age
[66:41] where you need to think about that um
[66:44] what happens if we need to get out of
[66:45] there and if if I needed to leave
[66:48] America very fast and I only had three
[66:51] days I would go to Thailand I would go
[66:54] to Thailand very accepting it's uh tons
[66:58] of biodiversity here um they're not so
[67:01] much on they do have some things with
[67:04] the the royalty and the king and all
[67:06] that you can't speak up upon the king
[67:09] harshly but um besides that I I feel
[67:11] more free when I'm in Thailand uh the
[67:15] red tape is less to do things like start
[67:18] a business and you know even owning a
[67:21] car and stuff like that so yeah I'd go
[67:24] to Thailand amazing really cool thank
