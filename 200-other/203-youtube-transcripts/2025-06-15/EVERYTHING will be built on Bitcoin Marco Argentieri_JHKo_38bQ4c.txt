[00:00] having other assets on bitcoin on the
[00:02] layer one can mess with the consensus or
[00:04] can in general can mess with the
[00:06] politics all altcoins are basically
[00:08] obsolete because you could do it more
[00:11] securely and better on a Bitcoin second
[00:14] layer or third layer it's very hard for
[00:16] me to have a b directional relationship
[00:18] I receive money from the employer that's
[00:19] it and I pay the grocery store that's it
[00:22] I will never be paid back so in this
[00:23] scenario lining doesn't work by Design
[00:25] it's not like a ux problem or it's not
[00:27] like an educational problem it's really
[00:29] like this is not designed for the
[00:31] checking account use case why do we need
[00:34] second layer Solutions is this idea
[00:36] concept we will stack you know seven
[00:38] eight layer but I think it's very hard
[00:40] because every time you go above a layer
[00:42] you lose a little bit of properties so I
[00:43] think it would be more like common to
[00:45] have an onion kind of architecture right
[00:47] so you have multiple layer at the same
[00:49] maybe multiple second layers and you pop
[00:52] between one and other but you're you try
[00:54] to stay closer to the base layer if
[00:56] someone with some weird thing on top of
[00:58] Bitcoin is able to break Bitcoin and
[01:00] then maybe Bitcoin was not that
[01:02] resilient to begin with I like to call
[01:04] Arc trustless Bank we have the base
[01:06] layer of Bitcoin we have second layers
[01:08] around it like an onion uh and those
[01:10] second layers just serve different
[01:12] purposes and in that way we get an
[01:14] ecosystem that's really really strong if
[01:16] we really want to increase the monetary
[01:18] use case of Bitcoin we need to make sure
[01:20] we can use it uh to pay we need to bring
[01:22] back
[01:23] [Music]
[01:26] Commerce today I really want to get into
[01:29] the The Arc and lightning and scaling
[01:33] Solutions and how is Bitcoin above like
[01:37] we have the Bas layer we know why it's
[01:38] so good we know um why we like Bitcoin
[01:42] for the the properties that Bitcoin has
[01:45] um and I think today it would be an
[01:47] amazing opportunity to talk with you
[01:49] about uh scaling solutions for um
[01:52] Bitcoin but first let's let's uh ask you
[01:56] like what are you doing at AR and also
[01:59] at V Ventures where you are also at and
[02:02] what are those companies doing so to
[02:04] give some context to to you sure um
[02:07] first of all thank you so much Robin for
[02:09] having uh it's really a pleasure to be
[02:11] to be on the Pod and yeah I've been I
[02:13] started my career very early on in in
[02:15] Bitcoin when I was 18 years old I
[02:17] created a startup uh which was a Bitcoin
[02:20] brokerage service so we were you know
[02:22] exchanging Bitcoin for cash and we put
[02:24] one of the first Bitcoin ATM back then
[02:26] in 2013 in north of Italy so um we've
[02:29] been I've been you know working in the
[02:31] space in the industry for a while but
[02:32] then after doing main experience
[02:34] especially in the software engineering
[02:36] space around the word I decided in 2017
[02:39] to go back to bitcoin and and focus on
[02:41] that so I co- founded Wen Ventures which
[02:44] is uh research and development lab uh
[02:46] with an investment Wing so we try to
[02:49] deploy our Engineers to deploy Capital
[02:51] when we can in project that we retain
[02:54] interesting for the Bitcoin uh for the
[02:55] Bitcoin space and yeah I think Arc came
[02:58] out of that uh really in the sense that
[03:01] many many years spent uh doing coverance
[03:03] research uh in the last three years and
[03:06] deploying um you know production use
[03:08] case um live in liquid especially gave
[03:11] us also this you know broader view in
[03:14] terms of like um how to design a new a
[03:17] new prot new protocols and how that
[03:19] could improve Bitcoin and yeah I think
[03:22] Arc have been you know proposed last
[03:24] year and we' have been like in a stealth
[03:26] way um start working on it in terms of
[03:29] like implementing the first
[03:31] prototype last in December last year we
[03:34] released a video where we did the first
[03:36] you know transaction then we kept
[03:37] working in this initial initial month
[03:40] but then we really and decided to go all
[03:43] in and we created this spinoff company
[03:46] called AR clubs which you know we are
[03:47] now focused 100% And the goal is really
[03:51] like trying to bring Arc to the world
[03:53] and to try into building Arc Services uh
[03:57] on top really cool um and I really like
[04:00] what what you're doing because we really
[04:03] have to develop those second layers um
[04:06] but there might be some some people in
[04:08] the audience uh that maybe are newer to
[04:11] to bitcoin uh and and and they maybe
[04:14] don't know like why do we need second
[04:17] layer Solutions like why why not just do
[04:19] it on bitcoin and why also um is like
[04:24] like what are second layer Solutions so
[04:25] maybe like really quickly just so so
[04:29] people understand like why do we need to
[04:31] second layer Solutions and what what is
[04:33] that is an extension to bitcoin and
[04:34] stuff like that sure I think and you
[04:38] know I go back also to my experience in
[04:40] 2013 when I was used you know to go
[04:42] around and orange peel people for me was
[04:46] super simple back then I I said to them
[04:48] hey download at the time maybe
[04:50] blockchain.info or whatever like just
[04:52] download a simple Bitcoin wallet you
[04:54] create a key pair even just a paper you
[04:57] know paper a paper wallet and that's it
[05:00] and they came to me I can send to them
[05:01] even $1 worth of bitcoin and that worked
[05:04] every time uh this of course you know
[05:07] going forward Bitcoin grew and of course
[05:10] as you as we know there are moment where
[05:13] the mol is so congested which means that
[05:16] you know to enter in the next block I
[05:18] will take you maybe 100 even $100 or you
[05:21] know you need to wait a lot of time to
[05:24] do that which is of course deny the
[05:26] initial point was so simple so easy to
[05:29] more people to bitcoin um and we
[05:32] understood that the blockchain gives you
[05:34] and the proof of work is incredible so
[05:37] what SAT camoto pull out was an
[05:39] incredible property to create censorship
[05:41] resistant money but the problem is
[05:44] blockchain don't scale and we need to
[05:47] figure out a way to make sure we can
[05:49] also scale otherwise we will uh go to a
[05:53] point where will be like the gold back
[05:55] back then so hard to transport and you
[05:58] end up with c stud basically and to
[06:01] capture the value so I think uh second
[06:03] layer solution our ways to not
[06:06] compromise on the EOS of Bitcoin to not
[06:09] compromise on the uh basics of what
[06:12] Bitcoin should be right so chor ship
[06:14] assistant money but at the same time
[06:16] makes you maybe of course with some
[06:18] trade-off in life there is no free lunch
[06:20] right so there always trade-off but um
[06:23] choosing your own subset of tradeoff uh
[06:26] there you need to have a way to make
[06:28] sure you can definently use the property
[06:30] of Bitcoin at the base layer also in
[06:33] other new use cases which is not only
[06:35] maybe potentially just savings
[06:37] right do you think that we need more
[06:41] than one second layer solution or will
[06:43] over time everything melt like in one
[06:46] second layer solution or like maybe in
[06:47] two three no I totally think that um
[06:51] there will be multiple protocols and and
[06:53] every protocol will have his own
[06:54] tradeoffs and even now we're using
[06:57] internet and there are a bunch of
[06:58] protocol we don't even know we are just
[07:00] saying yeah I'm using the internet but
[07:01] there are bunch of protocol behind of
[07:03] this UDP TCP and and they can even work
[07:06] at the same time together or just one on
[07:08] top of the other so I really think that
[07:11] at some point we will never talk about
[07:12] lining Arc or state chain we will just
[07:15] say Bitcoin right So eventually you know
[07:18] the application will just use bunch of
[07:19] other protocol to deliver you Bitcoin
[07:21] the same in the same way so and also
[07:24] again we're speaking about money here
[07:26] we're not speaking about uh you know
[07:29] communication protocols and to me every
[07:31] time you try to stack it so there is
[07:33] this idea concept we will stack you know
[07:35] seven eight layer but I think it's very
[07:38] hard because every time you go above a
[07:40] layer you lose a little bit of
[07:41] properties so I think it would be more
[07:43] like common to have an onion kind of
[07:45] architecture right so we have multiple
[07:47] layer at the same maybe multiple second
[07:49] layers and you hop between one and other
[07:53] uh but but you you try to stay closer to
[07:56] the Bas layer which is really like the
[07:58] the best right so Bitcoin is obviously
[08:00] best so closer you are better you are in
[08:02] terms of chor ship resistance so the
[08:06] idea would would be we have the base
[08:09] layer of Bitcoin we have second layers
[08:11] around it like an onion uh and those
[08:13] second layers just serve different
[08:16] purposes uh and in that way we get an
[08:19] ecosystem that's really really
[08:21] strong yeah I do I do believe this this
[08:24] will be the the likely scenario oh nice
[08:28] and what is now the
[08:30] the use case or like the the the need
[08:33] for for Arc and maybe because I think
[08:36] most people know lightning or at least
[08:38] heard about lightning uh and Arc is a
[08:40] little less known like how is the
[08:42] differentiation between Arc and and
[08:45] lightning yep I think lining just to not
[08:48] go too much technical on the differences
[08:50] but just from a very high level uh
[08:52] perspective I think lining the the
[08:55] beauty of lining has been this invention
[08:57] that allow you to have you know this
[08:59] payment Channel between me and you right
[09:01] so me and Robin we have a payment
[09:02] Channel and we know that we transact
[09:04] potentially back and forth multiple time
[09:07] so why not why doing a Bitcoin
[09:09] transaction every time we need to
[09:11] transact so why not we set up some funds
[09:14] there in this payment Channel and
[09:16] ideally will never touch the blockchain
[09:18] unless one of us you know is trying to
[09:21] you know to exit or is trying to you
[09:24] know to to scam the other and and and
[09:26] and so on and the beauty of lining has
[09:29] been why don't go beyond just to a
[09:32] payment Channel but why we don't create
[09:34] a network so if you robing of your own
[09:37] friend and you have a channel and I want
[09:38] to pay your friend I will use the
[09:41] balance we have between me and you Robin
[09:43] to you know to pay so I think this is
[09:45] like the the very you know uh simple
[09:48] concept of lining and one thing that uh
[09:52] maybe for non- technical or people not
[09:55] actually working and also I I mean I
[09:58] don't want go back 2017 when there was
[10:00] like block you know the block size War
[10:02] but really people tried to use this use
[10:05] case and to say okay we solve scaling
[10:08] right so we think that this is the use
[10:10] case that fits every type of payment use
[10:13] case which is not a reality because in
[10:15] practice like very few times I go back
[10:19] and forth in a payment for example and I
[10:22] will make an example so I introduce Arc
[10:24] where I think instead is more is more
[10:26] fit imagine the classic checking account
[10:28] right so you receive a salary once per
[10:31] month from your employer then you will
[10:34] never pay your employer back never
[10:36] because you only receive from your
[10:37] employer usually know most of the time
[10:39] and most of the other the other the
[10:41] funds will be spent through Merchants
[10:44] you know shops around the people or
[10:46] maybe paying dinner splitting dinner
[10:48] with you know new friends or or a Meetup
[10:51] so you understand how it's very hard for
[10:53] me to have a b directional relationship
[10:55] I receive money from the employer that's
[10:57] it and I pay the gross store that's it I
[11:00] will never be paid back so in this
[11:02] scenario lining doesn't work by Design
[11:05] is not like a ux problem or is not like
[11:07] an educational problem is really like
[11:09] this is not designed for the checking
[11:12] account use case which for me is really
[11:14] just last smile um you know how people
[11:17] use interact with money they receive
[11:19] usually you chunk and then they spay
[11:21] they pay random peers and lining doesn't
[11:24] work very well because you need to have
[11:25] this topology of of Channel or
[11:27] interconnected and you need to hope uh
[11:30] there will be a route um by then and we
[11:33] see that these T really like to
[11:35] centralize a lot uh because if you want
[11:37] to have relability you need to know very
[11:39] well uh this connection instead Arc I
[11:42] think it's much more different is much
[11:44] more similar to bitcoin on chain like
[11:46] the example I I I said before when in
[11:48] 2013 I was you know doing education
[11:51] early on like I just asked them a public
[11:53] key an address boom I pay them Arc is
[11:56] similar there is no Channel there is no
[11:58] inbound liquid idity which we can we can
[12:01] you know um go deeper later but there is
[12:04] really just oh hey give me your address
[12:07] and and I will pay you inside the arc
[12:10] and there is no need of liquidity
[12:11] between me me and you no Channel because
[12:13] there is an actor called The Arc service
[12:16] provider which this actor will make
[12:18] simple is a coordinator which makes
[12:20] simple uh to create uh Arc uh
[12:23] transaction which we we can go deeper uh
[12:26] for
[12:27] sure yeah maybe maybe let's go a little
[12:29] bit deeper here how because I think um
[12:33] Bitcoin are usually really conscious
[12:36] about their Bitcoin especially those who
[12:38] have their own keys and they don't want
[12:40] to give uh any control of of their keys
[12:43] away and that's why like it's it's
[12:44] really important to always like explain
[12:47] like how how does this work um I mean
[12:49] I'm always a little bit in two hearts
[12:51] because I know a little the more
[12:53] technically my podcast gets the more
[12:55] people uh step out but but I think it's
[12:59] important conversation uh but maybe we
[13:01] can can uh leave it as as as as easy as
[13:07] it gets but still get some some depth
[13:09] into there how does how does it work and
[13:12] and and yeah can you explain us yeah
[13:15] absolutely so I will start with a very
[13:18] simple elifi just to get an intuition of
[13:20] what an arc here is so I like to call
[13:23] Arc a trustless bank I know people maybe
[13:26] are a bit worried about the term bank
[13:28] but I think it's the best way to explain
[13:30] something to use things that people
[13:32] really are as already understanding and
[13:35] intuition so I use the term frostless
[13:38] and that's also the reason why I think
[13:39] Arc is a second layer because I can in
[13:42] any time without asking permission of my
[13:45] banker get my money out so the process
[13:48] works in a way where I take my Bitcoin
[13:50] on the layer one on on the normal
[13:52] Bitcoin blockchain I go to the arc
[13:55] service provider in in this case this
[13:57] this banker and say hey give me a
[14:00] virtual uh Bitcoin in exchange which is
[14:03] really similar to depositing gold and
[14:05] getting a check right and then what I do
[14:08] with these checks I can pay other people
[14:11] inside this Bank just trading my check
[14:14] for a new check right so I will say I
[14:16] will go again to the bank and I say hey
[14:18] you issued this check to me can you
[14:20] please use it to pay Robin right and
[14:23] Robbie maybe never even join the arc yet
[14:26] so he can just receive it inside the arc
[14:28] without even knowing I will just go to
[14:30] you Robin and say hey Robin there is
[14:31] this Bank go to the bank there are money
[14:33] for you waiting for you so and those are
[14:36] your uh your Bitcoin that at any time if
[14:39] the banker goes away you can go out and
[14:41] you can go to the Bitcoin blockchain and
[14:44] receive your actual Bitcoin in an actual
[14:46] utico in an actual aspan transaction
[14:49] output right and there is a caveat and
[14:52] which is very important and is this
[14:55] check as an
[14:57] expiration which means that and you know
[14:59] this is very common with check no like
[15:01] you have an expiration that usually if
[15:03] you don't don't don't go to redeem this
[15:05] this check from the banker uh before the
[15:07] expiration the the sender will will be
[15:10] able to REO right so this is very you
[15:12] know how check withd expiration works
[15:14] and I think V and now we can introduce
[15:17] the name virtual transaction output
[15:19] right so we really mimic what is the
[15:21] onchain the unpan transaction output and
[15:23] we call it virtual and this virtual
[15:25] transaction output gives you uh this
[15:27] guarantee uh that if you are at least
[15:30] live before the expiration uh you can
[15:32] get back your your your Bitcoin or get a
[15:35] new check with a new expiration so you
[15:36] can stay inside the arc uh without going
[15:38] on chain and you just need to go alive
[15:41] and say to the banker hey I'm I'm alive
[15:44] so okay this is very like high level so
[15:46] just to go now deeper how it works it
[15:49] works because this coordinator The Arc
[15:52] service provider what it does is
[15:54] basically create periodic transaction it
[15:57] can happen every 5 Seconds or it can
[15:59] happen once per month this is totally
[16:02] arbitrary and in this transaction this
[16:04] periodic transaction uh you create you
[16:07] basically it's very similar to around
[16:08] where all the people joins and and say
[16:11] Hey I want to exchange my check for
[16:13] another check and so all people GA and
[16:15] then when the coordinator is done and
[16:17] completed the all the signature from
[16:20] everybody will basically broadcast this
[16:22] uh transaction which is a normal Bitcoin
[16:24] transaction and there is one thing
[16:27] called the shared output
[16:29] this shared output the shared uo is
[16:32] basically an address very similar to a
[16:34] Channel of of lining which is a two of
[16:37] two in lining but here is like 1,000 to
[16:39] 1,000 or even 1 million to 1 million
[16:42] people can be aggregated all these 1
[16:46] million um PE people in in one single
[16:50] Bitcoin address so you see how is
[16:53] blockchain um foot footprint minimal so
[16:56] it really consume only one address and
[16:58] we can ideally put one million people
[17:01] one even one billion people of course
[17:03] there are like trade-offs but just to
[17:04] give you a sense how this shared shared
[17:07] output allow you to um horizontally
[17:10] scale to a large large number uh much
[17:13] more than lining where lining you need
[17:15] to have two of two two of two two of two
[17:17] so you need to have one channel every
[17:19] two um you know two Piers here we can
[17:21] have one single shared output and bunch
[17:24] of of other payment virtual Bitcoin are
[17:26] basically committed uh committed
[17:29] there so and the question is okay but I
[17:33] have this share let's say that this
[17:34] shared output is 10 BTC how do I get out
[17:38] how do I know that I can get my maybe I
[17:41] have one BTC right one virtual Bitcoin
[17:45] uh that is committed there how I know I
[17:46] can exit there is a condition in the
[17:49] script that that allow me to Exit
[17:52] unilaterally so there is unilateral exit
[17:54] at any time and the process works where
[17:57] basically all these virtual transac
[17:58] action are basically created in a binary
[18:02] tree so it's a binary tree of multiple
[18:04] transaction so it means that you know
[18:05] from the 10 BTC in this shared output
[18:08] which is on the blockchain you can
[18:09] really BCT which means you know you
[18:12] split five Bitcoin five Bitcoin then 2.5
[18:14] 2.5 2.5 2.5 so you go like a tree right
[18:18] a binary tree so you BCT that's the
[18:20] technical term and then you go you make
[18:23] sure that then all the actual Bitcoin
[18:25] can go out so it's a serious or actual
[18:27] real Bitcoin transaction that we just
[18:29] decide to never broadcast we only keep
[18:31] it virtual between us and the
[18:33] coordinator interesting um so you you
[18:36] always have the the the chance to get it
[18:39] out and you always have to the the thing
[18:42] like okay I I I want it now and that's
[18:45] also how you secure it in a way where
[18:48] there's not the same problem happening
[18:52] or hopefully not happening which
[18:54] happened with gold uh when we talk about
[18:57] gold because there was also that idea of
[18:59] scaling it with with the bank notes and
[19:01] and that's basically how how we how we
[19:04] have now the the Fiat system
[19:07] um but there's also like do you see when
[19:11] when there's only a small I had an
[19:14] episode with vicet uh where we talked
[19:16] about utx o management and how limited
[19:19] the base layer is and his thesis was
[19:22] like around five to 10 million
[19:25] institutions or persons will ever be um
[19:28] on the base layer uh to transact monthly
[19:32] uh to each other because at some point
[19:34] the the the 10 11th million person will
[19:38] be priced out of of the base layer do
[19:41] you see a an an risk there that we are
[19:44] getting too dependent on on second
[19:46] layers uh or that that we that there
[19:50] there is something like an in second I
[19:53] mean for some for some people even an
[19:55] ETF is a second layer where we we could
[19:59] have more Bitcoin than uh we we actually
[20:02] have um how do you see that situation do
[20:06] do you see any any problems there yeah
[20:09] it's uh it's totally true in the sense
[20:11] that um anything that you cannot afford
[20:15] to pay the minor fees is basically
[20:18] custodial and even right now we have
[20:20] very very few dust it's called dust
[20:22] amount basically you cannot never you
[20:25] since you cannot pay the minimum relay
[20:27] fee to be trans exacted on the main
[20:29] chain basically are Bitcoin that are not
[20:31] are a gift to the miners to be to be so
[20:34] um and I think this is also true for
[20:36] lining right so if I want to go out of
[20:39] the channel and the fees are so high in
[20:40] that moment and I want to broadcast the
[20:42] Justice transaction if the value of the
[20:45] channel is below the minimum relay fee
[20:47] of that moment you basically trust the
[20:50] other partner and on AR is no different
[20:53] in the sense that um when we want to go
[20:56] out if your virtual transaction output
[20:59] your virtual Bitcoin uh balance is below
[21:02] the cost of actually exercising this
[21:05] unroll we call it unroll unroll
[21:06] transaction which unilateral exit you
[21:09] from this three um you you you basically
[21:13] cannot do it that been said um there are
[21:15] many research on on the matter like for
[21:18] example if there is a very wealthy
[21:19] person who has another virtual Bitcoin
[21:22] but is very very wealthy and for him it
[21:25] doesn't care to pay I don't know 100
[21:26] bucks more to get out 1 million it
[21:29] potentially will subsidize for you or
[21:31] even you can do sort of class action
[21:33] right so many many small uh virtual
[21:36] Bitcoin holder if the this coordinator
[21:38] disappear they will be able to join
[21:40] forces and potentially pay pay that also
[21:44] there is approach called congestion
[21:45] control which say to you hey you will
[21:48] get your Bitcoin but to pay the minimum
[21:51] amount fee we need to wait one year
[21:52] right so you make sure that this three
[21:54] is enrolled in one year so you don't pay
[21:57] you don't go with I priority fee but you
[21:59] pay the minimum uh in the mle and that
[22:02] will be a good tradeoff it tells you hey
[22:04] you need to wait one year but you get
[22:06] you're getting your money your money out
[22:08] so this is another approach but that
[22:09] being said from a we say from a
[22:11] philosophical
[22:13] perspective I think personally I think
[22:15] Bitcoin again of course I am working to
[22:18] try to on board you know billion of
[22:20] people to bitcoin that's my uh my my my
[22:22] goal but at the same time I really
[22:24] understand that Bitcoin is not like a
[22:26] public good it's not something that
[22:27] needs to you know convey everybody at
[22:30] the same time really see Bitcoin as a
[22:31] Fed fism right so there will be people
[22:35] that are like you so rich and people
[22:37] which is land or Castle or you know an
[22:39] army and people will be peasons so this
[22:42] is like the way it works in the world
[22:44] but that and but and I see har in a way
[22:48] where maybe you cannot afford an entire
[22:50] like to take an example of home
[22:52] ownership right so people start when
[22:54] they are young they cannot afford to buy
[22:56] an entire house but they rent right
[22:58] right and Arc what gives you is really a
[23:01] financial model where basically you are
[23:02] renting people that are U so rich the
[23:05] service provider the coordinator is
[23:07] basically you know the equivalent of a
[23:09] landlord right which is giving you their
[23:11] uo their own chain uo and they will rent
[23:14] you to you some virtual uh transaction
[23:17] output and is incentivized to be live
[23:19] because more is live more he gets fees
[23:22] but even if it goes away disappear you
[23:24] can get back your actual Bitcoin out of
[23:26] there so I think the Eon checks out is
[23:29] really like a again is like a landlord
[23:32] that is you know renting you some
[23:34] blockchain you know utico space since
[23:36] you ride maybe in 20 year you ride would
[23:38] not be possibility for normal people to
[23:40] acquire entire utico that can happen but
[23:43] you can have a virtual Tico right
[23:46] interesting what what do the arc service
[23:49] providers uh get for providing a
[23:52] service yeah here I think it's very open
[23:55] in terms of business model but I mean
[23:57] the the the simple simp way to think
[23:59] about it is Imagine uh for for the
[24:01] service provider uh I don't know to have
[24:04] one BTC locked in a shared output it
[24:07] will cost maybe some Capital cost maybe
[24:10] to borrow or whatever or maybe you know
[24:13] as as we know there is a cost for
[24:14] liquidity and plus of that you also have
[24:16] a blockchain cost right Mining cost but
[24:19] let's say you have 1,000 people and for
[24:22] you to broadcast that transaction is
[24:23] $100 I mean not you the service provider
[24:26] it costs $100 to miners to broadcast but
[24:29] is 1,000 people you understand you can
[24:31] divide for that amount of people at
[24:33] least to cover the the blockchain cost
[24:35] and then you can charge something on top
[24:37] right some basis point on the value of
[24:40] the of the virtual Bitcoin so the
[24:42] pricing will be more similar to payment
[24:43] processor where you charge you know a
[24:45] fee a percentage of fee on the on the
[24:47] value that you are that you're
[24:49] transacting since you know the liquidity
[24:51] needs to be provided by the coordinator
[24:54] so uh there is a cost to that and and I
[24:56] think the the business model would be
[24:58] that similar but no other coordinator
[25:00] other service provider maybe they can
[25:02] charge you a subscription fee maybe
[25:04] right so they subsidize maybe more
[25:06] transaction or I don't know some Tire
[25:09] volume I think there there is a lot of
[25:11] experimentation in terms of business
[25:12] model but yes you can definitely think
[25:14] of a uh Business Point on on every
[25:17] virtual Bitcoin created just so they are
[25:19] kind of like Banks uh and and and then
[25:23] they can can do it uh between them
[25:26] interesting um when like I I know a lot
[25:29] of uh there's like lightning fediman
[25:32] there's Arc there's liquid like there
[25:34] are a lot of uh Layer Two Solutions you
[25:37] also told told me before that you think
[25:40] that they might be working together uh
[25:42] and they might complement each other um
[25:45] maybe can you give us a a small overview
[25:49] of of like the the most promising layer
[25:53] two solutions that you see and how they
[25:56] could maybe also work together in the
[25:57] future future and what use cases they uh
[26:00] they can give
[26:01] us I did see I mean of course this is
[26:04] semantic so it's very hard but if you
[26:06] want to say that to be a real second
[26:09] layer you need to have this unilateral
[26:12] unilateral exit uh capability I really
[26:15] see lining and Arc uh and maybe you know
[26:19] Mercury layer and state chain of course
[26:21] there are tradeoffs there but I really
[26:23] see these two of three uh kind of real
[26:26] second layer or the other are basically
[26:28] other blockchain that have some bridging
[26:31] mechanism and right now as as you know
[26:35] from my knowledge I think there is no
[26:37] trustless Bridge uh but even if tomorrow
[26:39] we get covenants and we can make proper
[26:43] trustless Bridge which means I deposit
[26:45] one Bitcoin and some address and this
[26:48] address issue some rid Bitcoin on the
[26:50] other chain on the side chain uh it's
[26:53] true is trustless this process if you
[26:55] trust the code and and and the stuff but
[26:58] the same time it doesn't feel to me an
[27:01] part of the main protocol you're just
[27:03] like moving your Bitcoin from one
[27:05] blockchain to another blockchain so it's
[27:07] very clunky right so it's like it's not
[27:09] really interoperability it's just you
[27:10] know I'm moving Bitcoin to another
[27:12] derivative form of Bitcoin but this
[27:14] doesn't feel on an upgrade of the
[27:16] protocol like lining which is an actual
[27:19] uh you know not broad not yet
[27:21] broadcasted Bitcoin transaction and even
[27:23] Arc is are not yet broadcasted Bitcoin
[27:25] transaction so I think these are really
[27:27] feels natural native second layer the
[27:29] other like not yet trustless but even
[27:32] though they will have bridge that will
[27:34] allow go between rapad and real Bitcoin
[27:37] in a trustless way they will feel a
[27:39] different separated Universe no there
[27:41] will be a different Universe a different
[27:42] blockchain a different Explorer so it
[27:45] feels a little bit to me that's how I
[27:48] see but in particular I see lining very
[27:51] very interesting because now going back
[27:53] like where lining shines and where uh
[27:55] potentially Arc doesn't and I think when
[27:57] we have two entities that are capable of
[28:00] doing two things running a server and so
[28:03] be online and uh understand the topology
[28:06] of the network understand how the
[28:08] liquidity should be deployed these
[28:10] entities to me doesn't sounds my mother
[28:13] or you know normal plebs it sounds to me
[28:15] banks exchanges um you know Arc service
[28:19] provider themselves so I really see
[28:22] these entities already capable to run a
[28:24] channel they create a channel between
[28:26] peers and they can settle between them
[28:28] and it's very common in Banks you know
[28:30] like if you think about the zwift
[28:32] network right or any other parallel I
[28:34] really see Ling more to that I know that
[28:36] has been sold as the Visa network of the
[28:38] consumer but I don't don't see that for
[28:41] like how it's been designed but I really
[28:43] see incredible tool for entities that
[28:46] need to settle between each other
[28:48] multiple times and they really need to
[28:50] go back and forth and two Banks they go
[28:52] back and forth because if I pay another
[28:54] bank you you have another bank my bank
[28:56] will basically pay the other bank but
[28:59] the bank will need to pay back and if if
[29:01] and if you substitute the banks to Arc
[29:03] service provider that's true because
[29:05] maybe me and you we are in the same Arc
[29:08] but then you have another friend which
[29:10] has another different Arc and I think
[29:13] it's super simple where I can basically
[29:15] use my virtual Bitcoin to pay aligning
[29:17] invoice all of this in an atomic
[29:20] trustless way so I can pay a lineing inv
[29:22] voice and that line invoice has been
[29:24] basically transformed at the end in a
[29:27] vitico in a virtual Bitcoin of the
[29:29] actual receiver in a different Arc so I
[29:32] really see lining as the lingua franka
[29:34] you know like the connective tissue
[29:36] between multiple layers and even
[29:38] centralize it or decentralize it it
[29:41] doesn't matter if it's Arc or is an
[29:42] exchange I think lining shines in that
[29:45] use case and yeah Arc really um benefit
[29:48] from from this multiple Arc will benefit
[29:50] from having
[29:51] lining so I mean to a certain extent
[29:55] lightning is already kind of the bridge
[29:57] between things you can really easily go
[30:00] from I don't know uh some some lightning
[30:02] wallets to even like Bitcoin exchanges
[30:05] uh from Bitcoin exchange to bitcoin like
[30:07] lightning is already um in a sense uh
[30:12] maybe not natively but uh maybe it could
[30:14] be better but uh um in a sense this this
[30:17] bridge and you see lightning kind of of
[30:20] this um Streets between those service
[30:24] providers who then can actually offer uh
[30:28] the daytoday transactions like the
[30:31] there's like an institution or like some
[30:34] sort of I don't like to use that word
[30:37] too much but Bank uh that lightning are
[30:41] transacting with each other and then
[30:43] there is an arc service provider and
[30:46] there you can give you like two EUR or
[30:49] like few sets for for coffee um that's
[30:52] an that's an interesting so like you see
[30:54] um basically uh lightning complement Arc
[30:58] and Arc complimenting lightning is there
[31:01] is there another one uh you would say is
[31:04] is uh important for that at the moment I
[31:07] think and I mean I I don't think this is
[31:09] a fault of of of the ecosystem but
[31:12] really like I think after 2017 we really
[31:15] stopped researching new scaling solution
[31:17] we just said okay we got lining and
[31:19] lining if it doesn't work the big
[31:21] blocker will will tell us we are not
[31:23] good no so I think everybody wanted to
[31:25] marry this idea this uh you know the
[31:28] idea that lining will fix everything and
[31:30] I think for a lot of years and I'm very
[31:32] convinced about this people stopped
[31:34] trying to think about new new thing and
[31:36] and try to think you know dedicated
[31:38] protocol for dedicated use case more
[31:40] like product oriented mentality right
[31:42] and I think AR has a lot of this like uh
[31:45] after four years of LSPs lining wallets
[31:48] and all the AR you know all the problems
[31:50] have been seen I think AR came to okay
[31:53] thank you we have done you know user
[31:55] research we have done you know
[31:57] interesting you know capability so now
[31:58] we can design a protocol for that
[32:00] specific use case but lining is very
[32:02] hard uh to work and I think inbound
[32:05] liquidity is the main issue there is no
[32:08] such thing in any other thing in the
[32:10] human um for for for end user for
[32:13] retailers like uh liquidity management
[32:15] channels it's something you need to
[32:17] explain but you know it's very technical
[32:19] it's very like uh not for normal people
[32:21] and the fact that you know I go around I
[32:23] go back to the example I Orange Peel
[32:25] someone and then I say hey download the
[32:26] lining wallet even noncustodial but then
[32:29] if I need to send you $1 I can't because
[32:31] it doesn't have a channel most likely
[32:33] and the the amount of Channel need to be
[32:36] deducted from the amount I'm sending so
[32:38] if I'm sending $1 for the first time to
[32:40] this guy you will say oh what such a
[32:42] scam I receive 20 cents uh where the 80
[32:45] cents go went and you need to explain ah
[32:48] there is inbound liquidity and people
[32:50] lose you right and and and I think
[32:53] that's uh that's how I see I really see
[32:55] for now lining a Arc and I as I said I
[32:58] think together they can you know um
[33:00] enhance a non self custodial
[33:03] noncustodial um approach to using
[33:06] Bitcoin that doesn't require eating the
[33:09] blockchain all the time thank you you
[33:11] already made it halfway through the
[33:12] video and I'm really really grateful to
[33:14] have you here two things make this
[33:17] channel possible you as a watcher and
[33:19] listener who keep supporting this
[33:21] Channel and another one is all the
[33:23] Bitcoin brands that I partner up with
[33:25] like 21 Bitcoin who support me from the
[33:28] very start and where I personally buy my
[33:30] Bitcoin from with code Robin you even
[33:32] get a discount when you buy Bitcoin with
[33:34] them and now also bitbox bitbox is the
[33:37] simplest and securest way to secure your
[33:40] Bitcoin and I heard a crazy statistics
[33:43] only 2% of bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin
[33:46] in a hardware wallet how crazy is that
[33:48] don't be in that 98% bracket be in the
[33:51] 2% bracket and if you have self- custody
[33:54] and you know your friend does not have
[33:56] maybe he needs a Christmas present Maybe
[33:57] he needs a birth of present and a small
[33:59] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[34:02] 5% off your order plus you support my
[34:05] channel and now let's get back to the
[34:07] video interesting how how much is uh
[34:11] before that um does any of this and this
[34:16] the future scaling Solutions of of uh
[34:18] Bitcoin with lightning with Arc with
[34:20] potentially other things um require any
[34:23] updates on the main
[34:25] layer yeah I think uh Covenant is the
[34:28] big um you know the big thing people are
[34:31] talking about and I think Covenant will
[34:33] one unlock new type of second lay that
[34:35] we don't even imagine right now uh so I
[34:38] think the community understand the value
[34:40] of covenants and and actually covenants
[34:42] were in Bitcoin from the day one so it's
[34:44] not something oh new shiny new thing it
[34:47] was AR raing Bitcoin but then
[34:48] deactivated for many reason blah blah
[34:50] blah um Arc as the beginning requir
[34:54] colant but you know many researcher in
[34:56] particular Ruben Samson you know
[34:57] proposed a scheme that will allow for
[35:00] you which is the main problem for Arc
[35:02] that requires Covenant is sending to you
[35:04] Robin and you are offline you know like
[35:06] this concept of a sync payment right so
[35:08] offline receiving and at the beginning
[35:12] the idea was okay you need Covenant for
[35:13] that and but actually you know Ruben
[35:16] came with his own uh new payment
[35:19] protocol which allow you actually to
[35:21] even without any change to bitcoin to
[35:24] actually send you offline and it just
[35:27] Chang the approach on how the art
[35:29] protocol works but you are confident and
[35:31] right now you know we release the two
[35:34] implementation one for Bitcoin and one
[35:36] for liquid and liquid is basically just
[35:38] a Bitcoin uh side chain that has
[35:40] Covenant updated so we can experiment we
[35:42] can see okay this is the best form of
[35:44] Arc possible if you get cant to more on
[35:46] bitcoin isier you can test it but then
[35:48] we are also using what we can right now
[35:51] on bitcoin with a different payment
[35:53] protocol we can do we can deploy on bit
[35:56] arc on bitcoin right now now the thing
[35:58] is that even though we sold the offline
[36:01] receiving there are huge trade-off and
[36:04] one for example you need to keep uh
[36:06] beside more interactivity because as you
[36:09] imagine since we don't have covenants we
[36:11] do a lot of pre signature between the
[36:12] peoples and it requires a lot of
[36:14] bandwidth but assuming that's not a
[36:16] problem I think the other problem is
[36:17] like I need as a user I need to keep a
[36:21] backup a special backup very similar to
[36:23] how lightning works and if I lose that
[36:25] backup I will not be able unilateral
[36:28] exit which is the same on on lining the
[36:31] beauty here is like this backup uh you
[36:34] need to keep it only until the
[36:36] expiration of your virtual Bitcoin right
[36:38] so it's a less uh so in lining you need
[36:41] to keep forever uh here you can prune it
[36:43] right after after one month you know
[36:45] after the expiration of your of your
[36:47] virtual Bitcoin and the other is to on
[36:50] board the arc if you get covenants but
[36:53] this is also true for lining we don't
[36:55] need to have a special wallet you you
[36:56] can just send to normal Bitcoin address
[36:58] for example tomorrow we go to binance we
[37:00] don't need to convince binance to
[37:02] integrate Arc like lining we just say
[37:05] hey you just withdraw normal Bitcoin and
[37:08] this Bitcoin address is actually an arc
[37:11] uh boarding address and I think that's
[37:13] for me is very important if you want
[37:15] really want to make it you know the
[37:16] standard protocol on how Bitcoin is
[37:19] transacted uh we really need this
[37:21] approach way where we don't require
[37:24] every player in the space to integrate
[37:27] special wallet to special wallet
[37:28] capabilities and lining has been very
[37:31] problematic for them to integrate
[37:33] because they took four years because we
[37:35] had to you know understand a specific
[37:37] protocol instead if they could just fund
[37:39] channels just sending to a Bitcoin
[37:41] address well the the adoption will be
[37:43] much better uh from an enter Enterprise
[37:46] standpoint and the other thing Covenant
[37:49] makes the liquidity management for the
[37:51] coordinator much much better and also
[37:53] this unroll uh three which may be
[37:56] problematic because imagine the 1
[37:57] million people in this Arc uh and they
[38:00] need to go out which means 1 million
[38:03] transaction I mean roughly I'm just
[38:05] telling you the a figure need to be
[38:07] broadcasted need to be published on the
[38:09] Chain which is pretty you know a
[38:11] congestion you know issue right and
[38:14] Covenants will allow you to unilateral
[38:15] exit using maybe fraud proofs and with
[38:17] Pro fraud proofs I can just exit by by
[38:20] myself I don't need to simple just
[38:22] single transaction and or for example we
[38:25] can allow you know as I said we can
[38:27] allow the liquidity to be much better
[38:29] for the SP so my point is that Arc is
[38:32] ready now so we can deploy we are
[38:34] working on it and people will see will
[38:36] use it very soon we are working as we
[38:39] speak but at the same time we recognize
[38:41] that for a proper retail you know
[38:43] Commerce oriented retail consumer mobile
[38:46] application uh I think Covenant will be
[38:49] the the best right so or the best
[38:51] scenario for building such type of
[38:53] application that is really self-
[38:54] custodial and has really minimal
[38:56] dependency to any other people that
[38:59] needs to help him to to have a
[39:01] wallet yeah I mean here I think there
[39:05] was uh at least like 10 guests already
[39:08] on that without me asking them they made
[39:11] advertisement for governance uh so I I
[39:13] think uh there's more and more consent
[39:17] finding for for that for that update How
[39:20] likely do you do you think it it will
[39:22] happen on or like in what time frame I
[39:24] mean it's impossible to say for sure but
[39:27] what what is your feeling yeah it's very
[39:29] hard especially in open source project
[39:31] first but in particular in Bitcoin to
[39:34] understand how you know things will
[39:36] change or will happen because you really
[39:38] need to have you know full consensus
[39:40] right is a distributed system so you
[39:42] really need to make sure that there is
[39:44] no huge you know controversy between you
[39:46] know two or three or four faction so but
[39:50] one thing is like I think like
[39:52] regardless of the proposal the specific
[39:54] current proposal there is I would say
[39:56] consensus that that's the best uh you
[39:59] know the the next step and if you look
[40:01] at too too is the last softwork uh to
[40:04] Roo is kind of a refactor what we call
[40:06] in from an engineering perspective we
[40:08] call it is a refactor of the scripting
[40:10] system and it looks like a person from
[40:13] the future came back and made too and if
[40:16] you don't do covenants is basically
[40:18] useless yes you make better signator you
[40:21] need matter multi but we all understand
[40:23] that was not necessary or super
[40:26] important like instead having very
[40:28] complex script right or like maybe I
[40:30] don't know 12 or 100 condition and
[40:33] without Covenant you cannot do much so I
[40:36] think yeah colant Bond very well with
[40:37] too so I think it's natural the natural
[40:40] next softw workk um I I really canot
[40:43] don't know but it sounds that people are
[40:46] talking now so and very actively couple
[40:49] of years we will maybe be in a good
[40:52] shape I think I'm I'm totally chilled it
[40:55] can take 10 years I'm okay um but uh but
[40:58] yeah I think I'm I'm hope I'm much more
[41:00] optimistic this year to be honest
[41:02] because of course being at the edge
[41:04] doing Covenant stuff in four years ago
[41:06] three years ago I wanted yesterday you
[41:08] know already Covenant on bitcoin but of
[41:09] course I understand and that's why I
[41:11] built a lot of stuff on liquid because
[41:13] there I could actually experiment with
[41:15] real money and real Covenant and go on
[41:18] production take feedback from the user
[41:20] so yeah I'm not in rush but yeah I
[41:23] hopeful hopeful hopefully in the this
[41:25] decade yeah and I think
[41:28] I mean there there's this one thing that
[41:30] Bitcoin has to be technically ready for
[41:33] like Mass adoption and Med exchange
[41:35] adoption uh that we actually can spend
[41:37] it every day with like really like a lot
[41:39] of people and I think we have still work
[41:42] there and I think lightning AR and all
[41:44] those um people that are included in
[41:46] those ecosystems are doing an amazing
[41:48] job every day um but at the same time I
[41:52] also see that most people don't even
[41:54] want to spend their Bitcoin right now uh
[41:56] because this is such an amazing store of
[41:57] value then most people live somewhere
[42:00] where there would be tax implications
[42:02] when they spend their Bitcoin they don't
[42:04] want to be on the illegal side or they
[42:07] don't want to pay
[42:08] taxes um there there are like from a lot
[42:12] of perspectives we're just really early
[42:14] on and I think we're now right now still
[42:16] in this store of value phase but it's
[42:19] really important that we before Bitcoin
[42:22] shoots up so much that a lot of people
[42:23] want to spend it and taxes are uh erated
[42:27] before that happens that we actually
[42:28] have the technical things nailed on and
[42:31] I like really using lightning on on
[42:34] conferences uh even though I have to
[42:37] document that and then have to like talk
[42:39] with my tax consultant and everything
[42:41] because there's actually tax
[42:42] implications which bothers me a lot but
[42:46] I want I want to do it the right way the
[42:49] thing is when you when you do all those
[42:51] things and you actually transacted you
[42:54] you contribute a little bit to to the
[42:56] new technology and we we just really
[42:59] early on and then we have to do that and
[43:01] one question that was in my mind when
[43:03] when you were talking uh about that
[43:05] onion thing and uh we can build several
[43:08] layers on on top of Bitcoin I heard it
[43:11] in the beginning a lot I don't hear it
[43:13] that much right now um that all Al coins
[43:16] are basically
[43:18] obsolete because you could do it more
[43:22] securely um and better on a Bitcoin
[43:26] second layer or third ler here or if you
[43:28] cannot do that it would be better in a
[43:31] actual centralized database for example
[43:33] I I don't know why video games has to be
[43:36] decentralized like like a video game
[43:39] money can be centralized I have like I
[43:42] have know in in that so either the the
[43:46] ALCO use case is on an actual
[43:48] centralized database because it's more
[43:50] efficient and more cost efficient so it
[43:53] will be better over time or it can
[43:55] actually be built on top of bitco and
[43:57] what's what's your opinion there yeah no
[44:00] the second the second thing that you
[44:02] mention like definitely most of
[44:04] centralizing coin think about stable
[44:07] coins or altcoin but just think about
[44:10] the stable coin that are at least have
[44:11] some usage or at least real um
[44:14] application is true you can definitely
[44:17] do it on a database but the best thing
[44:19] of blockchain is to scam Regulators in
[44:23] the sense that um the beauty of using
[44:27] you know whatever you know I don't know
[44:29] teder or usdc whatever I don't want to
[44:31] mention on any chain is that it seems
[44:34] decentralized so they can operate right
[44:36] so I think it's true from a from a you
[44:40] know theoretical perspective but I think
[44:42] people really care to not be the money
[44:45] transmitter to not be the actual person
[44:47] that otherwise will be Liberty reserve
[44:49] right so I can definitely do um you know
[44:51] stable coin much better with my database
[44:53] but that's Liberty reserve basically and
[44:54] that's how you went so these layers of
[44:56] blockchain insurance and so on divide I
[44:59] think the risk for the issuer and who is
[45:02] operating the blockchain who's operating
[45:04] the wallet infrastructure so I think
[45:05] this approach is like much more I will
[45:08] not say censorship resistant but
[45:10] resistant to to attacks to um um
[45:14] potential regulatory attack the other
[45:17] thing is like which I I believe and and
[45:20] I think having other assets on bitcoin
[45:23] on the layer one on bitcoin not Layer
[45:25] Two which that's another other topic but
[45:28] on layer one having other assets on
[45:31] bitcoin I think can mess with the with
[45:34] the consensus or can in general can mess
[45:36] with the politics because it means that
[45:38] now you have an asset which is you know
[45:41] not not native is not Bitcoin anymore
[45:43] you have a new asset that you you may
[45:45] have leverage to push for R fork or
[45:49] whatever I don't know I'm I'm I'm not
[45:50] saying I want to say I'm scared of what
[45:52] I don't know but is well known that in
[45:54] the end why I need to use the Bitcoin
[45:56] block chain which is low um super slow
[45:59] super expensive to translate an IOU in
[46:03] any way maybe it's better to do a second
[46:05] layer for sure because otherwise if you
[46:07] need to create yet another blockchain
[46:08] and yet another currency that's another
[46:10] problem because you are competing with
[46:11] Bitcoin from a monetary perspective but
[46:13] assuming you're doing a stable coin and
[46:15] you're not competing with Bitcoin you
[46:16] don't need your own blockchain you just
[46:17] need a ledger which is as networ effect
[46:21] good enough and we assume Bitcoin has
[46:23] good networ effect and all the exchange
[46:25] supported the speculation there if we do
[46:28] a simple second layer and we do assets
[46:31] on the second layer then we can use the
[46:33] Bitcoin Network effect to move also
[46:36] other assets and you know this is not
[46:38] new colored coin RGB tarot or you name
[46:42] it right so personally I think I will
[46:45] definitely if I need to use stable coin
[46:47] I I don't want to use it on bitcoin main
[46:49] chain I will use it on liquid or any or
[46:52] any other chain but I will go liquid
[46:54] because I don't want to acquire a
[46:55] shitcoin to pay for my gas fees right so
[46:58] I will just um use it on liquid there is
[47:01] T there so I use it there uh or maybe on
[47:04] Arc or maybe onling but again I think
[47:07] issuing the asset on the main chain of
[47:09] Bitcoin is just a not so interesting and
[47:12] they potentially mess uh with the
[47:15] economics of of Bitcoin so if you can
[47:17] keep the the
[47:18] assets far away from Bitcoin layer one
[47:21] I'm I'm
[47:22] happier MH I mean I I was really toxic
[47:27] uh like a year ago in Bitcoin like I was
[47:30] really toxic against all the altcoins I
[47:32] was really toxic against a lot of things
[47:34] that was not Bitcoin and I think um I
[47:37] don't know like I I got really um
[47:40] chilled now with Bitcoin in a
[47:44] sense if if Bitcoin is actually the
[47:46] sound money and actually the the the the
[47:49] solution to to to the problem that we
[47:51] have with the monetary system the the
[47:54] thing that we actually think it is
[47:57] then it does not matter what other
[48:00] people do with it it's also with the
[48:02] ETFs I heard it a lot like oh but now
[48:04] like order executive order 6012 will
[48:07] come now to bitcoin and stuff like that
[48:10] and I'm like it's a possibility that it
[48:13] comes um but gold survived it and if
[48:17] Bitcoin is strong enough Bitcoin will
[48:18] also survive it so like if if Bitcoin uh
[48:21] is is strong enough and it's actually
[48:24] the sound money that we think it is and
[48:27] I actually think it is that um that it
[48:29] could withstand also the the the weird
[48:33] things that can happen on top of uh
[48:36] Bitcoin that I'm not a fan of like I I'm
[48:39] I I would like to use Bitcoin as money
[48:41] and nothing else like I I don't like
[48:44] weird things on top of the of the
[48:46] Bitcoin layer um other people might like
[48:48] it it's it's it's okay for me uh but
[48:51] they should not be able to break Bitcoin
[48:54] that that's that's kind of my point uh
[48:56] so like if if someone with with some
[48:58] weird thing on top of Bitcoin is able to
[49:00] break Bitcoin then maybe Bitcoin was not
[49:03] that resilient in to begin with but I
[49:06] don't I don't think that like that was a
[49:09] a weird monologue
[49:11] but my my my my point was I think the
[49:15] Bitcoin is the most soundest money and
[49:18] most robust Network that we ever had and
[49:20] we should protect it at all costs um um
[49:24] but the the reason that that it's so
[49:27] robust is the reason why I'm so chilled
[49:30] about most of the things yeah totally
[49:34] and uh and makes sense and and to me
[49:36] like I I think if other people are using
[49:39] the Bitcoin blockchain for things that
[49:41] are not moving Bitcoin is the f is our
[49:44] fault in the sense that we are not using
[49:46] Bitcoin enough as you said no there are
[49:48] many complication tax implication or
[49:50] it's not only scalability it's not only
[49:52] cost even if I give you the perfect
[49:53] scalability solution but then people are
[49:55] not using because so volatile that you
[49:57] know why I need to use it unless maybe I
[50:00] receive Bitcoin as as a as a salary so I
[50:02] think there are many other concept which
[50:03] is beyond technology that are not there
[50:06] yet in in pieces to let you really leave
[50:09] out of Bitcoin because when we save
[50:11] money yes for sure saving is huge
[50:13] component of money because I want to
[50:14] save but then at some point I need to
[50:16] spend it right so otherwise it's like um
[50:20] it's a it's other piece which I agree is
[50:24] not there yet there's not U there is no
[50:26] rush to do that but I think like if we
[50:29] really want to increase the monetary use
[50:32] case of Bitcoin we need to make sure we
[50:33] can use it uh to pay we need to bring
[50:36] back Commerce and it's very funny to me
[50:37] but I I really say that early on bitcoin
[50:40] was much more used uh for many other use
[50:43] cases REM people that don't even know
[50:45] about Bitcoin don't even believed or
[50:46] understood what Bitcoin was but for them
[50:48] was a cheaper Wester Union right and
[50:51] they used that and there is no document
[50:53] to open a Bitcoin wallet for them was
[50:55] amazing and people non txav they were
[50:58] coming buy Bitcoin I think now terer
[51:00] took a lot of that use case no like of
[51:02] course because you don't have the
[51:03] volatility in that and people understand
[51:06] $1 $1 and and of course a lot of that
[51:08] use case but I really think that we
[51:10] should bring back Commerce and I think
[51:12] Bitcoin is a definitely great um
[51:15] instrument maybe not buying the coffee
[51:17] or in in the real life store but even
[51:19] starting just with digital Commerce I
[51:21] think that's a huge opportunity where we
[51:24] are just getting too complacent and we
[51:26] say okay who cares we just hold and we
[51:28] don't use it but actually I think it
[51:30] makes sense for you to try to say okay
[51:33] maybe I will take alha my salary in BTC
[51:35] so I'm let's say I'm forced to use it
[51:37] right so uh yeah so I think uh we really
[51:40] need to increase the the Commerce use
[51:43] case I would say yeah I I would love to
[51:46] just use price out them right to price
[51:48] out the JP if that was
[51:51] the because if if it's so cheap to put
[51:54] some random stuff on there then then
[51:56] then we should use it more as money
[51:58] you're absolutely right with that um one
[52:00] last thing uh I want to to to mention
[52:04] because guests actually brought it up
[52:06] and and one very popular guest also
[52:08] brought it up on my podcast Jeff boof uh
[52:11] is fedy min uh and uh he said something
[52:15] uh with that was very similar to you
[52:18] that uh the lightning is like the
[52:20] highway streets uh and I think uh he
[52:24] said like super highway or something
[52:25] like that um and then he sees like those
[52:29] cities and towns and he say like see
[52:32] sees like a fedin Al as those cities and
[52:35] towns um how how is aiment is is not the
[52:39] the unilateral thing that you talked
[52:41] about is that the key difference or and
[52:44] why would you like prefer um um Arc
[52:48] above aiment or maybe has fed him some
[52:52] just another use case no I think it's
[52:54] much more similar um thinking about how
[52:57] will look like when you replace Arc with
[53:00] fedin so I think it's that that
[53:02] explanation makes s the sense but again
[53:04] Arc uh is more expensive than Fint by
[53:07] Nature because there's a liquidity cost
[53:09] that need to be paid for someone instead
[53:11] Fint is a database so it cost you few
[53:14] dollars per month to keep a Fed Min you
[53:16] know either Fint or even cash you a
[53:19] single doesn't matter but you understand
[53:21] that when you are custodial a lot you
[53:23] cannot compare you know is apple and
[53:25] orange things you can really compare
[53:26] because when you are custodial you have
[53:28] zero cost for doing anything your cost
[53:30] is the tradeoff uh sorry is the trust
[53:32] tradeoff right so and also how to
[53:34] explain to user that this there is a
[53:36] trust and how you explain to regulator
[53:39] that you are not a money transmitter or
[53:40] whatever so I think um I think they they
[53:44] both have a place and to me as I said
[53:47] before you know even below a certain
[53:49] point Arc becames custodial because you
[53:51] cannot afford to pay your your your exit
[53:54] transaction and I think for all the use
[53:56] cases you know very small micro payments
[53:59] I think you know eash fedin are very
[54:02] good for example right so um I don't
[54:05] know maybe just you know an Hotel system
[54:07] or a festival you know let's take an
[54:09] example you do a festival why I need to
[54:11] do an AR even an arc transaction you can
[54:13] just create you know a simple you know
[54:15] as a small village and we just you know
[54:17] deposit our Arc Bitcoin at at the at the
[54:20] counter and I get my cash uh you know
[54:22] eash uh and then I using inside to be to
[54:25] P to pay things inside that Festival
[54:27] then the festival will end in two three
[54:29] days and then I will exit and of course
[54:31] I'm coming to the festival and the
[54:32] festival as an incentive to not steal my
[54:34] money because he wants to sell me more
[54:36] beers and more stuff so I think all
[54:38] these cases are totally fine and and and
[54:40] I think there would be a place for that
[54:42] and even I think running an arc service
[54:45] provider I think you need more people
[54:48] you need more entities and why not
[54:50] creating a fedin to run an arc right to
[54:53] be a service provider so you can
[54:54] definitely have like your bodies in
[54:56] investment bankers they all coordinate
[54:58] and they create a fine uh to do that to
[55:00] provide liquidity so I think there are
[55:02] many other use cases of course like as I
[55:04] said before if we stop innovate if you
[55:06] stop research uh we are stuck with
[55:08] lining and whatever less and then now we
[55:11] again we are again the same problem we
[55:12] need to stack things that are not
[55:14] designed for what we need to do but just
[55:16] because they are available so to me it's
[55:17] like a kind of a defeat to say no okay
[55:20] let's not innovate let's not research we
[55:22] that's what we have and just you know
[55:24] stuck some trust layer all around um so
[55:28] yeah I think again I would see ecash to
[55:31] enhance um you know many others uh
[55:34] situation where Bitcoin is used and
[55:36] where you know the trust tradeoff is
[55:38] more than accepted um so I think they
[55:41] also will copy it but is very hard to
[55:43] compare and I don't believe people
[55:45] should I mean I don't believe we need to
[55:47] stop now researching maybe in 20 years
[55:49] 40 years if we figure out that the the
[55:51] trust is the only way to scale Bitcoin
[55:53] okay then we can you know have our white
[55:56] flag and and and and say defeat but I'm
[56:00] more I'm more optimistic let's say let's
[56:03] let's try to to to be more adherent to
[56:05] the Bitcoin EOS and how Bitcoin should
[56:08] work yeah and that's I think that's the
[56:10] that's the whole point like the more
[56:12] people develop in the stuff the better
[56:15] the chances that we come up with
[56:16] something that actually works in the end
[56:18] of the day because uh no matter what
[56:21] layer solution even uh no matter what
[56:24] layer solution to bitcoin
[56:27] nothing has right now the mass use case
[56:31] because only a small like only very
[56:33] small percentage of people actually get
[56:36] Bitcoin in the world and then from those
[56:39] only a small percentage actually also
[56:41] work with those layer to so like when we
[56:43] look at the whole world we are still
[56:45] very very early and very very uh small
[56:49] we not that early because we're 15 years
[56:51] in but we are very very small still um
[56:54] so in that way uh everything that's
[56:57] developed now is for something really
[57:00] good even though maybe we come to to the
[57:03] conclusion oh this is actually a bad
[57:05] thing or this is this is the thing we
[57:07] always should have focused on or
[57:09] something like that but we we probably
[57:11] don't know yet like at least I don't
[57:12] know yet that's that's the thing yeah
[57:15] perfect then uh let's come closer to the
[57:17] end of the podcast um there's one
[57:21] question before the the endro tetin
[57:23] questions what are you most excited
[57:26] about in Bitcoin like what are you
[57:27] looking forward in the next like one
[57:29] year 5 years 10 years whatever um what
[57:32] is something that you're like oh I'm I'm
[57:34] I'm looking forward to that event or
[57:35] that thing happening or whatever you
[57:37] want to to go there I assume beside Arc
[57:42] right
[57:44] yeah no I think um I'm very interested
[57:47] things like I mean if you just but they
[57:49] are not that far away like silent
[57:51] payments for me those things are very
[57:53] interesting because it from it's one of
[57:57] those things that are like not making
[57:58] the ux worse for the user they're
[58:01] actually improving the user experience
[58:03] of the user and also bringing you
[58:04] privacy so on that side I think silent
[58:06] payments is for me the most exciting
[58:08] things uh so far but uh again like
[58:11] assuming uh Bitcoin with you know a
[58:14] better Bitcoin script which means you
[58:16] know coverance I really think you know
[58:18] that we can really trying to think uh in
[58:20] a more bold way to how to build a
[58:24] Bitcoin native economy which which means
[58:26] you know new kind of you know economic
[58:28] Primitives which now we are just of
[58:31] course comparing things with you know
[58:32] the Fiat system the Fiat economic system
[58:35] but how will look like I don't know
[58:36] lending how will look like derivatives
[58:38] based on a Bitcoin standard where you
[58:40] know you cannot print money uh so you
[58:42] need to you know trying to find other
[58:44] ways and but I think you know like
[58:46] Beyond savings and commerce there is a
[58:48] huge market and a huge need of this you
[58:50] know uh Financial products and financial
[58:53] Primitives so I really looking forward
[58:55] to I don't know Bitcoin native uh stable
[58:58] coin which means there is no Fiat bank
[59:00] account in entire stock they're just
[59:02] using Bitcoin collateral and the
[59:04] issuance and the the burn of this stable
[59:07] coin ideally uh is done you know
[59:10] directly on the Bitcoin blockchain so I
[59:11] think I'm super excited about that I
[59:13] work on this and this project called
[59:14] Fuji Fuji money on on liquid and I
[59:17] really looking forward to that like I
[59:18] really think that that would be a huge
[59:21] thing you know like also trying to bring
[59:23] native Native you know Financial
[59:25] Primitives also also to bitcoin new
[59:27] things things that you know uh current
[59:29] people don't even imagine so yeah really
[59:31] cool perfect um then uh we have two
[59:36] questions the to the endro team the
[59:38] first question is always the same
[59:39] question even though I changed it a
[59:42] little bit uh the the LA the the last
[59:44] time in the podcast the first time um so
[59:48] the question is what can we learn from
[59:51] you besides all things Bitcoin okay very
[59:55] very good question
[59:56] I think I I mean in general I think you
[59:58] know also my my experience you know I
[60:00] went also before starting working in the
[60:02] Bitcoin space I also you know worked a
[60:05] lot in what you can call Big tech and
[60:07] and whatnot and and I think there you
[60:10] have really smart smart people and there
[60:13] is a barrier between those smart people
[60:15] that don't even believe on the premise
[60:17] of Bitcoin they really believe in the
[60:18] you know in whatever is the status quo
[60:20] and they are super smart engineers and I
[60:22] think yeah I think one thing I try and
[60:25] keep trying with you know my all my work
[60:27] is trying to bring that type of
[60:29] Competency the type of engineering
[60:31] attitudes also to bitcoin which is much
[60:34] more like I would say uh Freedom let's
[60:38] say more EP style which is totally love
[60:40] it and that's why I'm in Bitcoin but
[60:42] also trying I think what we try to do is
[60:44] like to bring the type of you know um
[60:48] Enterprise ready or in general you know
[60:50] trying to bring you know uh the type of
[60:52] approach that you know made Amazon
[60:54] Facebook you know multi million dollar
[60:56] company and also trying to bring also
[60:58] this to to bitcoin and of course many
[61:00] challenges but yeah I think that's
[61:03] that's the goal amazing really good one
[61:06] actually uh because we have to we we
[61:10] have to get more uh serious sometimes
[61:13] it's like we we we are still a young
[61:15] industry uh but when you see the big
[61:19] conferences around Bitcoin uh like in
[61:23] America Nashville in a Europe the
[61:24] Bitcoin PR conference uh things like
[61:27] that then you see like oh there's an
[61:28] actual Big Industry uh around and behind
[61:33] Bitcoin and and it's good to see the uh
[61:36] the professionality of of Bitcoin
[61:38] companies and Bitcoin in general is is
[61:41] going up and yeah now with the edfs
[61:43] entering with with publicly trading
[61:45] companies entering with with countries
[61:48] entering we will have we see we will see
[61:51] this anyways perfect then uh let's come
[61:53] to the end routine of our podcast where
[61:56] the previous guest is asking a question
[61:57] for the next guest without knowing who
[61:59] actually is the next guest and the
[62:01] question from the previous guest is I
[62:04] totally unrelated the question to
[62:06] bitcoin uh but it's an interesting one
[62:08] what is a personal health habit which
[62:11] you know you should do but you don't uh
[62:15] going going bad early going bad early
[62:18] but uh you know working with many time
[62:20] zone and you know being maybe in the
[62:23] middle you know Central Europe time zone
[62:24] but then working a lot with Soviet
[62:27] America I go bed late maybe I stay too
[62:30] much with the screens computers you know
[62:32] working in Tech so yeah definitely I'm
[62:34] guilty of too much technology so so
[62:37] you're guilty of working too hard or or
[62:41] maybe too too addicted to technology you
[62:43] know because most of the time you can
[62:44] work even with computer but you are
[62:46] always connected too much online so I
[62:48] think that's uh that's definitely
[62:50] something I wish to improve perfect then
[62:54] um Before I Let You Go where can people
[62:56] find you uh where can people ask you
[62:58] questions yeah I'm I'm on Twitter uh my
[63:01] nickname is T you can find me t t or
