[00:00] And if you put, you know, $10,000, which
[00:02] is one/10enth of a bitcoin into that
[00:04] reverse kga calculator, even if it does
[00:07] 50% over the next 15 years, then you're
[00:10] sitting at about $4.2 million US. The
[00:13] beginning of the Bitcoin gold rush,
[00:15] which essentially goes back to January
[00:17] 2024, was when the SEC approved the the
[00:20] ETF. How most people measure Bitcoin
[00:23] still from the fiat system. You know,
[00:25] we're all trying to measure our life
[00:27] through a broken money system. uh when
[00:29] it comes to being a Bitcoiner. Um but at
[00:31] some point we've got to start rewiring
[00:33] our thinking and start thinking in terms
[00:35] of of Bitcoin and Satoshi's and it just
[00:38] opens up a whole new world for you in
[00:40] terms of what's possible. When you stop
[00:42] thinking of Bitcoin just as a store of
[00:44] value and somewhere along the line we
[00:46] need to be able to transact uh in this
[00:49] value system. I guess the challenge is
[00:51] is people right now they still think to
[00:54] themselves, well, why on earth would I
[00:56] spend Bitcoin when the KGA is 50 to 60%
[00:59] a year? I'm better off to spend my fiat.
[01:02] You know what I mean?
[01:05] [Music]
[01:08] I want to touch on one topic that is
[01:10] really controversial in Bitcoin and I
[01:12] think you also touched on it in in some
[01:14] of your videos. Um, I always say that
[01:17] 0.1 Bitcoin will be plenty and will be
[01:19] really good and like can potentially
[01:22] retire even your family depending on
[01:24] where you live and what your definition
[01:26] of retirement is. Um, but I get a lot of
[01:30] backlash from from that whenever I say
[01:32] that. And I think uh most Bitcoiners
[01:35] aren't actually bullish enough on
[01:37] Bitcoin. it it feels like people don't
[01:40] grasp the full potential of Bitcoin and
[01:42] they only look like oh like what's the
[01:44] total addressable market like maybe like
[01:46] it will be gold. Uh how do you look at
[01:49] this this whole thing of like 0.1
[01:51] Bitcoin retirement and and what's the
[01:54] the full potential of of of Bitcoin?
[01:56] Yeah, I mean I guess there's a there's a
[01:57] lot of videos out there circulating that
[01:59] kind of um have the one 0.1 thing going
[02:03] and and it's very topical at the moment.
[02:06] And you know the way I look at it is um
[02:10] when I first got started in Bitcoin I
[02:12] was kind of h I was focused on a target.
[02:14] So I kind of had in mind once I'd done a
[02:18] certain amount of study, a certain
[02:19] amount of work, I'd read read the book
[02:21] uh Bitcoin Standard um started listening
[02:24] to Robert Breedlove, Michael Sailor, um
[02:29] quite a bit with Andreas Antonopoulos.
[02:31] Um and so once I'd sort of been down the
[02:34] rabbit hole and I decided, well, hey,
[02:36] this is this makes sense for me to get
[02:38] involved, I was thinking in terms of
[02:41] round numbers. Um, and you know that was
[02:44] back in January 2018 that I that I
[02:46] started. Um, but I remember uh about 2 3
[02:51] weeks after that the price of Bitcoin
[02:53] fell by by about
[02:55] 30%. Um, but the but the thing the thing
[02:58] is is that because I I knew what I was
[03:01] getting into, um, I used that as an
[03:03] opportunity to to stack more. Um, and
[03:06] I've kind of just been following that
[03:07] same strategy pretty much ever since for
[03:10] the past 8 years. But when it comes to
[03:12] the 0.1 thing, you know, I think most
[03:15] sort of retail uh Bitcoin potential
[03:19] Bitcoiners, you know, they kind of see
[03:21] the the price of Bitcoin at 100K and it
[03:24] kind of scares them off. Um and they
[03:26] think, well, you know, the potential for
[03:29] me to to to get to one whole Bitcoin is
[03:32] kind of out of reach. And and so rather
[03:35] than people kind of feel like they've
[03:37] missed the boat or they're too late to
[03:39] Bitcoin, I like to say to them, well,
[03:41] look, you have to understand where we
[03:44] are on the adoption curve with this
[03:45] asset. Um, this is kind of like the the
[03:48] internet 1999. Um, and you know, just
[03:52] because uh you didn't buy a Bitcoin like
[03:55] Max Kaiser or somebody for you know for
[03:58] a buck or under a buck or or whatever it
[04:00] was in 2020 2010 2011 uh you can still
[04:04] get a decent foothold uh into into
[04:06] Bitcoin. And so when I look at 0.1 and I
[04:10] look at Bitcoin's historical compound
[04:13] annual growth rate uh over the last
[04:15] decade uh sitting at 55 to
[04:19] 60%. And if you put you know $10,000
[04:22] which is onetenth of a bitcoin into that
[04:25] reverse kga calculator and if bitcoin uh
[04:29] even if it does 50% over the next uh 15
[04:33] years uh then you're sitting at about
[04:36] 4.2 two million US dollars. And so it it
[04:41] just helps to give people a little
[04:42] perspective that if they allow the
[04:44] compound, you know, the law of
[04:46] compounding to to really do its thing,
[04:49] uh, you know, it's not too late for them
[04:52] to set themselves up for a for a very
[04:54] comfortable retirement if they have a 10
[04:56] to 15 year time horizon. So, you know,
[04:59] for me, it's all about just making
[05:01] people understand that there is no
[05:03] better investment, I believe, than
[05:05] Bitcoin. You're not too late. Um, if you
[05:09] just break it down into bite-sized
[05:10] pieces and kind of start start at 0.1 as
[05:13] a target, because I believe that anybody
[05:16] who's kind of in their, you know, 40s or
[05:18] 50s who is thinking about retirement in
[05:21] 10 to 20 years, if they put their mind
[05:24] to it, they can get to 0.1, you know.
[05:26] So, um, so that's kind of my theory
[05:29] around it. Um, and I find that most of
[05:31] the people I talk to, I do a lot of
[05:33] one-on-one sort of, uh, consultations
[05:35] with people in that age bracket. Um, and
[05:38] most of them already are at
[05:40] 0.1. So, um, they're just looking to
[05:43] sort of build that stack and get their
[05:45] self custody in the right in the right
[05:47] setup and all of that. So, that's how I
[05:50] see it. That's really good. And I think
[05:53] we also should not forget that 0.1
[05:56] Bitcoin at the current price, it's
[05:58] almost
[05:59] $10,000. So that's a lot of money.
[06:02] That's more money than most people on
[06:04] Earth have. Like the the average person
[06:06] on Earth doesn't have $10,000 in a
[06:09] savings account. This is you're already
[06:12] above the 50% line. Maybe like above the
[06:15] top 40% in the world. when when you have
[06:17] that amount even if Bitcoin stays at the
[06:20] same purchasing power right now. So that
[06:23] that's something I think to to consider.
[06:26] I think a lot of those comments and say
[06:27] like oh like 0.1 bitcoin is not enough.
[06:30] They they they might have like 100k
[06:33] maybe uh 200k of expenses each year and
[06:36] of course like then like 0.1 bitcoin uh
[06:39] will take a while till you can retire on
[06:41] on on that. Yeah. No, I agree with that.
[06:44] And and you know, I guess um you know,
[06:47] we live in a big world where, you know,
[06:48] 8 billion people and and we understand
[06:50] that uh most people uh you know, in the
[06:53] end are going to need Bitcoin for its
[06:55] for its purchasing power uh preservation
[06:59] qualities. Um but you know, I think in
[07:02] the future we're going to be thinking in
[07:03] terms of Satoshi's, not in terms of
[07:05] Bitcoin. Um and so you know a lot of
[07:09] people don't understand that that 0.1 is
[07:12] like uh what 10 million
[07:15] Satoshi's and um you know there's a
[07:17] belief that at some point maybe not in
[07:19] our lifetime but maybe in our you know
[07:21] my kids' lifetime uh we're going to see
[07:25] Satoshi and dollar parody you know
[07:27] because um Bitcoin is kind of a monetary
[07:30] system that is designed to actually
[07:32] repric the world. So, so yeah, it's um I
[07:36] think eventually uh we're going to cross
[07:38] that cross that point where we won't be
[07:40] talking about Bitcoin as much as we're
[07:42] actually talking about SATs. Very very
[07:44] true. I love that. And you you touched
[07:46] on a little bit. I completely forgot my
[07:48] first question today that I usually ask.
[07:50] The question is like who are you and and
[07:52] what are you doing and why are you
[07:53] excited about Bitcoin? Um maybe give us
[07:56] a little bit of a background like what
[07:58] are you doing with the retirement
[07:59] consulting and and and who you are.
[08:02] Yeah, great. Um, so I'm I'm 52. I came
[08:06] to Bitcoin in uh 2018. I heard about it
[08:09] in uh 2013 just like everybody else. The
[08:12] first time I heard about it, I I I
[08:14] dismissed it. I thought it was crazy. It
[08:17] didn't make sense. Uh at the time, I was
[08:19] very busy um in my business for 15
[08:22] years. Uh my wife and I were um hosts of
[08:28] a seminar company in Australia. We we
[08:30] founded the company in
[08:32] 2005. Uh and so for 15 years we
[08:35] basically promoted and uh facilitated uh
[08:39] live seminars around the country mainly
[08:41] in the health and wellness and personal
[08:44] development space. Um and then in uh
[08:48] 2020 co came along and it was an
[08:51] opportunity for us to rethink because we
[08:53] couldn't travel and do the events. Um,
[08:55] and that was when I really, even though
[08:57] I'd been in Bitcoin for a little while,
[08:59] that was kind of the time where I I
[09:01] really started to pay very close
[09:03] attention and and really double down on
[09:05] my on my study and my learning uh about
[09:07] Bitcoin. And um, it's kind of been that
[09:10] way ever since. So, the last 5 years,
[09:13] I've been very much down the rabbit
[09:14] hole. Always learning, though. I feel
[09:17] like Bitcoin is something that you can
[09:18] never stop learning. Every time you
[09:20] think you know everything there is to
[09:22] know about Bitcoin, you you hear
[09:24] something else from somebody like Jeff
[09:26] Booth or, you know, CJ Constantinos or
[09:30] somebody like that and you go, "Wow, I
[09:32] never I never thought of it that way."
[09:33] And um so I'm always learning, but I I
[09:37] for me, I see um I see Bitcoin as a and
[09:40] the thing that drew me to Bitcoin was
[09:42] I've always been uh involved in real
[09:44] estate uh investing. And in Australia,
[09:48] we've always had this uh love affair
[09:50] with with property and real estate. Uh
[09:53] and you know, most Australians think
[09:54] that real estate is the best performing
[09:57] asset. Uh most of our wealth is tied up
[09:59] in real estate or the family home. Um
[10:03] but whatever it was when I came back to
[10:06] Bitcoin in in 2017, I actually uh
[10:09] somebody else said to me, "Hey, have you
[10:11] heard about this Bitcoin thing?" And I
[10:12] said, "Yeah, I've heard about it, but it
[10:14] doesn't really make a lot of sense to
[10:16] me." Uh, and then I signed up for a um a
[10:19] publication out of a um there was a a p
[10:22] publisher in Melbourne who it was a
[10:25] gentleman by the name of Sam Vularing.
[10:28] Uh and he put out this um this whole uh
[10:31] publication on uh essentially Bitcoin,
[10:34] Ethereum, and XRP. And it was basically,
[10:38] you know, Bitcoin is the digital gold.
[10:40] Ethereum is going to be the new internet
[10:42] where everything is going to be built on
[10:44] top of it and XRP is going to be the new
[10:46] money. Um, and so that just really got
[10:49] my interest and um, that's kind of where
[10:51] I where I've been with Bitcoin ever
[10:54] since. But uh, for me it was really uh,
[10:58] I started out at with Bitcoin because I
[11:01] thought,
[11:02] well, if this really is a finite asset,
[11:06] uh, then I want to have a piece of it,
[11:09] right? even though I don't really
[11:10] understand what it is and how it's going
[11:12] to work. The fact that it is the only
[11:13] finite asset that that humanity has ever
[11:16] known for me, uh I feel like I need to
[11:19] have some some part of that and kind of
[11:21] that was the that was the start of it.
[11:24] But um you know, I've come to realize
[11:26] over several years now that there's so
[11:28] much more to Bitcoin than than just
[11:30] that. And I think I'm in the camp with
[11:33] the likes of um you know Peter Dunworth
[11:36] who's another great Australian guy
[11:38] Bitcoiner who who is very uh vocal in
[11:40] this space and I think he's one of the
[11:42] top voices in the space. Uh I believe
[11:45] that we've crossed the the chasm now uh
[11:49] as far as Bitcoin the potential of
[11:51] Bitcoin failing or going to zero is is
[11:54] off the table, you know, because
[11:57] essentially we now have endorsement from
[11:59] the biggest entity on earth, which of
[12:01] course is the US government. Uh and
[12:03] whether you like that or not, I think
[12:05] that's just a reality that was always
[12:07] going to happen um if Bitcoin survived
[12:10] to this point. Uh so
[12:13] um you know I think it's all it's all
[12:15] good things ahead ahead for Bitcoin and
[12:17] uh I'm just so happy to be a part of
[12:19] this community because all I see is the
[12:21] smartest minds in on earth all sort of
[12:24] working together to to to help people
[12:27] you know um and that's why I love it.
[12:30] That's that's an amazing amazing thing.
[12:32] Yeah, just just really quickly, I I love
[12:35] Jeff and CJK as you mentioned it. Both
[12:37] have been actually two times on the
[12:38] podcast already. And funny enough with
[12:41] CJK, I record the third round in like I
[12:44] don't know 6 hours or something like
[12:46] that. So, I'm looking forward to to
[12:48] that. It's it's funny that you bring him
[12:49] up the the day I record with him also.
[12:52] Um, you you mentioned crossing the
[12:54] chasm. I think that's something a lot of
[12:56] Bitcoiners kind of talk about. Um, do do
[12:59] you think it's all about the the
[13:01] strategic Bitcoin reserve or like why
[13:04] are we now across the chasm and what
[13:08] does this actually mean? Yeah. Well, I
[13:11] think you know I think Michael Sailor
[13:13] says it best you know I mean we all love
[13:16] what Michael Sailor has done for for
[13:18] Bitcoin. Um but when he says that you
[13:21] know uh the most important defining
[13:24] moment for Bitcoin the beginning of the
[13:27] Bitcoin gold rush which essentially goes
[13:29] back to January 2024 was when uh the SEC
[13:33] approved the the ETF you know and um so
[13:37] I think that was step one and then step
[13:39] two was the US government uh you know
[13:43] finally making a decision that they were
[13:45] going to endorse Bitcoin and and and uh
[13:48] you start utilizing it as as a strategic
[13:51] asset. I mean, I haven't heard how
[13:54] they're actually going to acquire the
[13:55] million Bitcoin that they intend to
[13:57] acquire because apparently they want to
[13:58] do it in a in a budgetneutral fashion
[14:01] without raising taxes and without um you
[14:04] know, printing money. Um there is some
[14:08] talk that maybe they're going to
[14:09] dispense with some of their gold
[14:11] reserves, which would be fascinating if
[14:13] they were to do that. Um but I think
[14:16] that all of these
[14:18] uh these events that have taken place
[14:20] have kind of led us to this point where
[14:23] um you know governments around the world
[14:26] uh are indebted. Uh they know that they
[14:29] can't raise enough in taxes from the
[14:31] people because it's politically
[14:32] unpopular to do that. Um yes they have
[14:36] access to the big red button uh to print
[14:38] money. Um, but all that does is drive
[14:41] inflation and and and a and a cost of
[14:43] living crisis and uh growing wealth gap
[14:46] and we see all the problems in society
[14:48] that that's creating. Uh and so I just
[14:52] think that uh if bit Bitcoin remains
[14:54] decentralized and secure uh as the great
[14:57] Jeff Booth keeps uh keeps telling all of
[15:00] us, then uh then Bitcoin is is is is
[15:05] eventually going to to to take over the
[15:07] financial system is what I believe.
[15:10] um you know and and so yeah that's I
[15:14] think when those critical events that
[15:16] have taken place in the last what 18
[15:19] months
[15:20] um give me immense confidence moving
[15:22] forward into the future and I think a
[15:24] lot of other people as well.
[15:27] Yeah, it's it's it's kind of amazing how
[15:28] how many good news it they was a tweet
[15:32] that I recently saw I think from Nico
[15:33] from Simply Bitcoin. He tweeted out,
[15:36] "It's the best cycle for news in
[15:38] Bitcoin, but it's the worst cycle for
[15:40] price action." And I kind of find it
[15:42] funny because I'm amazed how how much
[15:47] good news and how
[15:50] less bad news, how less fat there are is
[15:54] out there. Even if I go out in in
[15:56] outside of a little outside of my bubble
[15:59] and and talk with people in in Austria,
[16:02] yeah, they might not like Bitcoin. in
[16:04] the mind like, oh, it's a little
[16:05] volatile, but there's not a really big
[16:08] reason they don't buy it. They they they
[16:11] most they're just too lazy to do the do
[16:13] the do the work. So, I feel like we have
[16:16] everything ready and it's just not the
[16:19] same excitement as it was uh years ago.
[16:23] And my theory, and I'm I'm I'm curious
[16:26] how how you think about that. My theory
[16:29] currently is just like, yeah, it's
[16:30] institutional money that drives the
[16:32] price and retail is completely sleeping
[16:34] on Bitcoin currently.
[16:37] Yeah, I think you're right about that.
[16:38] Um, but I think that, you know, I did a
[16:41] video today on my channel and I was
[16:43] talking about
[16:44] how people are going to come to Bitcoin
[16:46] either by choice or by force, you know,
[16:49] and I think that, you know, even though
[16:51] retailers asleep and the price action
[16:53] has been stagnant, we have to remember
[16:56] that Bitcoin uh crossed what 100K for
[16:59] the first time in was it December uh or
[17:03] November last year? I think towards the
[17:06] end of the year. When was it? I think it
[17:09] was November. I can I can look it up
[17:11] next to when Yeah. So, I mean that was a
[17:13] defining moment. I mean, you know, I
[17:15] remember the time when we crossed 10,000
[17:18] and and everyone was like, "How did that
[17:20] happen?" You know, it's like, you know,
[17:23] we we we just keep forgetting these
[17:25] these these little milestones that are
[17:27] taking place right before our eyes. And
[17:29] then you know I think that generally
[17:32] speaking because Bitcoin is such a
[17:35] dynamic asset um you know we and it's a
[17:40] very youthful asset. I mean it's it's
[17:42] still an an adolescent. I mean I raised
[17:46] three girls so I know what it's like to
[17:48] have three 16y olds uh growing up you
[17:51] know and and so Bitcoin's a 16 year old
[17:53] 16year-old baby. So it's going to have
[17:55] its ups and downs right. We have to
[17:57] understand that uh anything that is that
[18:00] young is is is is going to uh it's it's
[18:04] going to be volatile. And so um you know
[18:06] it's uh I just think people are
[18:09] impatient. Uh we've we've probably been
[18:11] spoiled in the early days with Bitcoin
[18:14] about you know how uh how explosive the
[18:18] moves are. U but I think this just just
[18:20] an evolution of this asset. you know,
[18:22] it's going to
[18:24] uh it's it's at some point the the
[18:28] compound annual growth rate is going to
[18:29] level out, but I still think that
[18:32] um you know, all of the all of the
[18:36] growth is is is ahead of us given the
[18:38] where we are on the adoption curve and
[18:40] what less than 3% or 3 and a half% of
[18:43] the population worldwide has any
[18:45] exposure to Bitcoin. So, um I I think
[18:49] it's all ahead of us. I just think that
[18:51] um uh you know, Nikico's right. It's uh
[18:55] all this great news, but not a lot of
[18:56] price action. But um but I think uh I
[19:00] think it's going to it's going to happen
[19:01] and uh and we'll all be very very
[19:04] pleased. But we just have to remember
[19:06] with all of this too, Robin, like you
[19:09] know, I'm a great believer in in in
[19:12] everything that Jeff Booth says
[19:14] about how most people measure Bitcoin
[19:18] still from the fiat system.
[19:20] you know, we're all trying to measure
[19:22] our life through through a broken money
[19:24] system uh when it comes to being a
[19:27] Bitcoiner. Um but at some point, we've
[19:29] got to start rewiring our thinking and
[19:32] start thinking in terms of of Bitcoin
[19:34] and Satoshi's and how that is actually
[19:37] the value system and repricing all of
[19:40] the stuff on the debt base side. You
[19:42] know, that's what I think.
[19:44] Yeah, it's it's a moment when you no
[19:48] longer say, "Hey, this house is
[19:51] $250,000." You say, "Oh, this house is
[19:54] 0.56 Bitcoin." It's the moment when you
[19:58] default do, hey, I want to earn in
[20:01] Bitcoin. I want to transact in Bitcoin.
[20:03] I want to spend in Bitcoin. And I
[20:06] declare my wealth in Bitcoin. and I
[20:10] measure how much better I got when I
[20:13] have in bit uh in in Bitcoin in
[20:15] Satoshi's. How many more Satoshi did I
[20:17] get this month versus last month? That's
[20:20] the measurement and no longer US dollar.
[20:23] And I did that for my personal life. Um,
[20:25] I completely denominated everything uh
[20:28] from net worth and everything like that
[20:30] in Satoshi's, which makes it way easier
[20:34] and a lot less emotional if you just
[20:37] have a set amount of Satoshi's that
[20:40] increases slightly every month. It's
[20:43] it's great. It's going up linearly. It's
[20:45] nice nice growth. If you have
[20:47] denominated in US dollar, you see jumps
[20:50] up and down and you're like, "Oh [ __ ]
[20:52] like that. That's like so volatile." But
[20:54] that mind shift and and I I I'm a big
[20:57] believer in the people that make that
[21:00] mind shift earlier like not just buy
[21:02] Bitcoin but make that mind shift to
[21:04] Bitcoin will benefit the most because
[21:07] they get that
[21:09] that you you've met probably also some
[21:12] OGs that have been in Bitcoin since like
[21:14] two more two cycles or more. I they have
[21:17] some and I I've I'm not one of those.
[21:20] I'm just like one one cycle a little bit
[21:22] more than one cycle here. They have that
[21:25] sen feeling about them. They are so
[21:27] calm. They are so in the moment and they
[21:31] all do the same thing. They just have
[21:34] Bitcoin and they buy Bitcoin when they
[21:37] have fiat and they spend Bitcoin if they
[21:39] need some money because they're just all
[21:41] in Bitcoin and they don't care about the
[21:44] volatility. They don't play the fiat
[21:46] games. They just like, "Hey, I have
[21:48] Bitcoin. That's my life and this sen
[21:51] calmness is
[21:53] amazing and uh that's where I try to to
[21:57] get I think that's where we all
[21:59] eventually aspire to be um you know
[22:02] because at the end of the day you know
[22:04] Bitcoin is uh ultimately not just meant
[22:07] to be a store of value it's also
[22:09] actually meant to be a medium of
[22:11] exchange you know and I tend I think a
[22:13] lot of Bitcoiners tend to forget that um
[22:15] but the more you listen to people like
[22:18] Jeff Booth truth. Um, you start to re
[22:22] remember. It's not that we we don't
[22:24] know, it's just that we forgot because
[22:27] we're spending so much time thinking
[22:29] about stacking Satoshi's and and holding
[22:32] on and never selling your Bitcoin and
[22:35] and and uh multigenerational wealth. But
[22:39] at some point I do believe that there
[22:42] will be more of a par of a parallel
[22:46] economy running where people are value
[22:48] exchanging. Uh I know it's already
[22:50] happening. Uh and there are some
[22:52] companies that we know in this space
[22:55] that all they do is uh you can only pay
[22:58] them in bitcoin right you can only pay
[23:00] them in satoshi. So there are already
[23:03] certain businesses that are already
[23:04] doing this and uh when you transact with
[23:07] those companies and you start actually
[23:09] utilizing Satoshi's to do that, it just
[23:13] opens up a whole new uh world for you in
[23:16] terms of what's possible. Um and you
[23:19] stop thinking of Bitcoin just as a store
[23:20] of value. Um so I find that I I think
[23:24] we're going to get to that point. I'm
[23:25] not sure how long that's going to take,
[23:27] but I I do believe that
[23:30] um the more Bitcoin, the more people
[23:32] that come to Bitcoin, the more adoption
[23:35] uh that takes place, I think the more
[23:37] that um you know, we're going to start
[23:41] uh pricing everyday items in Satoshi's
[23:43] and people are going to want to do
[23:45] business like that. And and I also think
[23:47] that what what may accelerate this is
[23:50] when people start saying I'm no longer
[23:53] going to accept dollars, you know,
[23:55] because maybe they inflate the currency
[23:59] away to the point where people go, well,
[24:01] this this shit's worthless now, you
[24:03] know? It's
[24:05] like, you know, uh we we we're not
[24:08] prepared to work for dollars anymore.
[24:10] You know, maybe that's 5 years, maybe
[24:12] it's 10. I'm not sure. But I I can see a
[24:14] day where perhaps that that may come as
[24:16] well. I'm not saying everybody. I'm
[24:18] saying certain factions of society will
[24:20] will say, "Well, I'm I'm not going to
[24:22] build you a house or I'm not going to,
[24:25] you know, do the electrician, be an
[24:28] electrician or whatever, whatever the
[24:30] work is, whatever the exchange is." They
[24:32] say, "Well, we only accept
[24:34] Satoshi's." Um, I can see that day
[24:37] coming. How about you? I see that a
[24:40] faster and faster approaching because
[24:43] you
[24:44] have I now already I I always try to to
[24:49] bring things back to what I actually
[24:51] know and and already experience and one
[24:54] year ago I already had the podcast and I
[24:57] already earned money from the podcast
[25:00] and the podcast was all about Bitcoin
[25:02] but one year ago exactly one year ago I
[25:05] did not had a single Satoshi earned I
[25:09] only earned euros.
[25:11] So, and this changed now so much that
[25:15] now 70% roughly of my income is directly
[25:20] earned in
[25:21] Satoshi's and about let's say 10 20%
[25:26] something like that of my expenses also
[25:28] directly in Satoshi's. So, I I'm forced
[25:31] to sell Bitcoin uh on on that because I
[25:33] have fiat bills to pay. But the
[25:36] percentage will get bigger and bigger
[25:39] and it's more and more of a hustle for
[25:42] me to accept fear on earning and
[25:46] spending. I just want to have Bitcoin.
[25:49] Like that that's the the income and the
[25:52] expenses in Bitcoin is growing. And the
[25:54] more this grows, the the the less the
[25:59] the less I'm getting a fan of still
[26:01] accepting Fiat. And we're seeing that
[26:04] with a very famous example, uh Ben from
[26:07] PTC sessions. He says publicly uh on on
[26:11] my podcast, he said it on many others
[26:14] also. He said, "If you want to pay me in
[26:17] fiat, I charge you a 15% premium because
[26:22] I don't want to deal with fiat. So if
[26:25] you force me to deal with fiat, I charge
[26:27] you a premium. It's not a discount on
[26:29] Bitcoin payments because Bitcoin
[26:31] payments is the standard. So if you want
[26:34] to have something else, you get a
[26:36] premium. I mean, of course, you have to
[26:38] be in a position where you can do that.
[26:41] charge people premium just for the for
[26:43] the what money they use. But it will get
[26:45] more and more common if someone has
[26:48] something valuable to sell and they can
[26:50] choose who to sell it to, they will
[26:53] choose to earn it in Bitcoin. And this
[26:56] will be the norm. And I'm amazed how far
[26:59] we already you said before like you like
[27:02] 16 year old teenager. Uh and and I'm 26
[27:05] years old. So I'm not that far away from
[27:07] from that time. And I still feel very
[27:08] volatile.
[27:11] But uh 16 is nothing. And we already
[27:15] have a circular economy around the
[27:17] world. I already got get paid and
[27:19] already pay in Bitcoin. So there's
[27:21] already a payment stream that's only in
[27:24] Bitcoin. It's so exciting how fast we
[27:26] are progressing and people only look at
[27:29] the price and they don't see the real
[27:31] revolution that's going on outside of
[27:33] yeah the price is going up a little bit.
[27:35] Let's take a break for a moment and
[27:37] appreciate the beauty that Coin
[27:40] Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[27:42] watches. Those watches are the most
[27:45] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[27:48] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[27:51] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[27:54] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[27:57] watch collections. You have the date of
[27:59] the first ever mined Bitcoin block in
[28:03] there and of course also the block
[28:05] height and which epoch we are currently
[28:08] in. I love the level of detail they put
[28:11] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[28:13] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[28:16] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[28:19] love those watches so so much. And now
[28:22] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[28:24] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[28:27] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[28:28] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[28:30] first way is you put it on a hardware
[28:33] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[28:36] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[28:39] Bitbox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[28:42] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[28:45] if you check out the link in the
[28:46] description, you even get 5% off if you
[28:49] use the code Robin. And the second way
[28:52] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[28:55] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[28:58] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[29:01] They will personalize for you a
[29:04] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[29:06] your individual situation. They will
[29:09] show you how you can secure your own
[29:11] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[29:14] enough. You also have to keep all your
[29:16] devices secure. One topic that is
[29:18] overlooked often is the inheritance
[29:21] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[29:24] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[29:26] a plan for that in place already? And
[29:29] last but not least, if you're in a
[29:30] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[29:33] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[29:35] that, head over to the
[29:39] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[29:42] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[29:45] be for the first time ever speaking at
[29:47] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[29:50] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[29:53] really looking forward to seeing all of
[29:55] you there. You can get your ticket in
[29:57] the link down in the description of
[29:59] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[30:02] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[30:05] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[30:07] there. Well, I I agree, man. And this is
[30:09] this is kind of you articulated that
[30:12] really well because that that's the
[30:13] point that that I'm really trying to
[30:15] make here is that, you know, we're kind
[30:18] of in this little eco chamber as
[30:19] Bitcoiners. You know, everybody's
[30:22] running podcasts and sharing their
[30:24] wisdom and trying to orange pill the
[30:26] world and tell people, hey, there's a
[30:28] life raft here. Get on this get on this
[30:30] bloody life raft as quickly as you can.
[30:33] Um and you know
[30:36] but store of value and preserving your
[30:39] economic energy is just part of the
[30:42] equation. You know there's so much more
[30:44] to it beyond that that I think as time
[30:47] goes on um I mean we're all learning.
[30:50] I'm learning I'm learning every day. I'm
[30:52] learning more and and getting more
[30:54] comfortable with the idea of um you know
[30:58] what not that I'm there yet but the idea
[31:01] of starting to exchange value in in
[31:04] Satoshi's and and like you say it's just
[31:06] it's a space that I can see is moving
[31:08] really fast. I guess the challenge is,
[31:12] you know, if if
[31:14] uh all the world is still operating in
[31:18] euros or or dollars, um you know, it's
[31:22] pretty hard to ask them people outside
[31:24] of Bitcoin for Bitcoin or for Satoshi's
[31:27] uh when when they don't own any Bitcoin
[31:29] or Satoshi's, you know. So, it's just
[31:31] we've got to wait until there's that uh
[31:34] I guess that next wave of adoption where
[31:37] uh becomes more common for people to
[31:39] have their Bitcoin savings account and
[31:43] their dollar account and and yeah, and
[31:45] then like Ben says from BT uh BTC
[31:48] sessions, you know, like you've now got
[31:50] a choice. You want to save, you want to
[31:52] save, you uh you you you pay in uh in
[31:55] Satoshi's. That's very that's very very
[31:57] true. Um, one question that I'm still a
[32:01] little little bothered by or like
[32:03] bothered I I still ponder around that
[32:06] question. Um, Jeff brought it up in in
[32:08] the last podcast I did it with with him.
[32:11] He said if Bitcoin fails as a medium of
[32:13] exchange, it will ultimately also fail
[32:16] as a store of value. Do you agree with
[32:18] that? I never understood that, but now
[32:21] I'm starting to understand that, you
[32:23] know, and and I think we've got to go
[32:24] back to the Bitcoin white paper, you
[32:26] know, to to somewhere along the line,
[32:29] and I'm not sure whether it was uh
[32:33] Michael Sailor coming in and really
[32:35] advocating it for it to be a store of
[32:37] value and never sell your Bitcoin. I'm
[32:39] not I'm not sure if that's where it all
[32:41] sort of moved away from the peer-to-peer
[32:45] cash thing. Um because I think it's fair
[32:47] to say up until till
[32:49] 2020 we still really didn't understand
[32:52] that much about Bitcoin. You know we we
[32:54] didn't really know whether it was going
[32:55] to survive. And you know I think that
[32:58] whole uh era with the health crisis was
[33:01] a time where
[33:03] uh people really started to double down
[33:08] on looking for alternatives and trying
[33:12] to escape the matrix. and Bitcoin was an
[33:15] obvious thing for people to to spend
[33:17] some time learning about during that
[33:19] during that 2020 2021. Meanwhile, Micro
[33:22] Strategy comes along and they start
[33:25] really leading the way and and Michael
[33:27] Sailor becomes a public figure. But
[33:29] yeah, I I I the more I listen to Jeff
[33:32] Booth, the more I realize that uh that
[33:35] that is the case. uh that we we at
[33:38] somewhere along the line we need to be
[33:40] able to transact uh in this value
[33:43] system. I guess the challenge is is
[33:47] um you know people right now they still
[33:50] think to themselves well why on earth
[33:52] would I spend
[33:54] bitcoin when the kagger is 50 to 60% a
[33:58] year I'm better off to spend my fiat you
[34:01] know what I mean and so I think we've
[34:03] got a ways to go so I'm not quite sure I
[34:06] mean Jeff's a he's a genius guy and I
[34:09] don't know how how you know how much
[34:11] time he sees that we need for it to
[34:14] reach that critical point where unless
[34:16] we move into a medium of exchange, it
[34:18] will fail. I'm not sure is that 5 years,
[34:21] is it 10 years? Um because we're not
[34:24] there yet, right? And Bitcoin's not
[34:25] failing. It's it's getting stronger and
[34:27] more
[34:29] decentralized. But is there a point
[34:31] where we need to move from a store of
[34:33] value into a medium of
[34:35] exchange? And and I believe historically
[34:39] uh through the evolution of money, I
[34:41] believe that it's always begun as a
[34:42] store of value uh and then moved into a
[34:45] medium of exchange. And so maybe that is
[34:48] yet to come. Um but yeah, I certainly
[34:52] believe that uh I'm not sure whether it
[34:55] will fail cuz I I I'm not sure about
[34:57] that. Um, but I certainly believe that
[35:00] for Bitcoin to be a ubiquitous part of
[35:03] society, we will need to utilize it as a
[35:06] medium of exchange in in some form. And
[35:08] I think with Lightning,
[35:10] obviously, it presents the opportunity
[35:12] for us to go down to the corner store or
[35:15] local cafe and buy a coffee and have
[35:17] instant settlement. Um, the tools are
[35:20] already there. You know, it's just uh
[35:22] it's just a matter of time for the for
[35:24] the adoption to to to come in, I guess.
[35:29] Yeah, it's it's also something that I
[35:31] struggle a little bit with um with with
[35:33] saying like if if media exchange fails,
[35:36] unit uh store of value should also fail.
[35:38] For me, I I like to bring another
[35:41] perspective into this. I I like to say
[35:44] if Bitcoin as a store of value succeeds,
[35:47] people will start spending it and it
[35:50] will succeed also as a medium of
[35:52] exchange. I think that's a natural
[35:54] progression and we already seeing that
[35:56] with like myself and like a lot of other
[35:58] people uh as an example how this
[36:00] actually works out. So I think it's a
[36:03] natural progression but I think uh the
[36:06] message that he says is very important
[36:08] that you should not lose the focus
[36:11] because if everyone is just focused on
[36:13] number technology maybe everyone is all
[36:16] of a sudden no longer in the base uh in
[36:20] the base layer and you're like just
[36:22] trying to get a little bit more Bitcoin.
[36:24] just trying to maximize with leverage
[36:26] with ETFs with strategy with other
[36:29] vehicles to gain more more store of
[36:33] value more number technology. So I think
[36:37] the the focus should be on sovereignty
[36:40] and and less on number technology. Maybe
[36:43] that's also one of the the messages
[36:45] behind the the the thing he's saying
[36:48] with med exchange and and and store of
[36:50] value where we have to focus on the the
[36:53] the sovereignty. Um, it's also, I think
[36:55] we talked about it before that, um,
[36:58] you're also really big on how to be
[37:00] self-s sovereign and you're going
[37:01] through through through that right now,
[37:03] I think, uh, as you said, with with
[37:05] Tony. Um, how how important is how
[37:08] important is self- sovereignty and why
[37:10] do you think people struggle with that
[37:12] and keep it on exchange and do those do
[37:15] those weird things? I think it's just
[37:17] education, you know? I I think it's just
[37:19] uh we've become so accustomed over so
[37:22] many years to just entrust the system to
[37:26] take care of our our assets and our
[37:28] money and you know everything from real
[37:30] estate to to to you know shares and
[37:33] stocks and everything in between.
[37:36] They're all tied to the system and we
[37:38] don't really uh when it all boils down
[37:41] to it actually own them. we we kind of
[37:43] have a paper claim on them for as long
[37:46] as we're following the rules, you know,
[37:48] and and so like we don't everybody
[37:51] thinks they own their house, but we only
[37:53] really have a a title deed or or a paper
[37:57] claim that says that, you know, we own
[38:00] that that piece of real estate. But the
[38:02] reality is that um the rules can be
[38:05] changed and uh property rights can be
[38:08] taken away and and you know we don't
[38:10] have absolute ownership of that asset
[38:12] and we only really own it for as long as
[38:14] we're paying the land taxes and the
[38:16] rates and and everything that that that
[38:18] goes with it. And so when I think of
[38:21] Bitcoin, I think it is as um the only
[38:25] sovereign truly sovereign asset that we
[38:28] have absolute autonomy and ownership of.
[38:33] And so, you know, when you think about
[38:36] storing your wealth that you've worked,
[38:38] you know, 20, 30, 40 years to
[38:41] accumulate, you know, and this most of
[38:43] the people that that I talk with and and
[38:46] consult with, you know, they're in their
[38:48] sort of late 40s, early 50s, and they
[38:50] have maybe 10 to 15 year time horizon
[38:53] until
[38:54] retirement. And you know we have things
[38:57] happening in this country now that are a
[38:59] concern in terms of uh the going after
[39:03] uh taxing unrealized capital gains in in
[39:06] superanuation. That's a a new rule they
[39:08] want to bring in. Um we just had an
[39:11] election here and that the the party
[39:13] that uh said that that's what they're
[39:15] going to do. Everybody voted for that.
[39:16] So they think they have a mandate to
[39:18] bring that in and so people are
[39:20] concerned because they don't know what
[39:22] their retirement funding is going to
[39:23] look like. And so, you know, I just
[39:27] think that, you know, when it comes to
[39:30] protecting and preserving everything
[39:32] that you've worked so hard to accumulate
[39:35] over a lot of years, everybody should
[39:37] have some allocation to this sovereign
[39:40] money that is completely portable,
[39:42] completely permissionless. There's no
[39:45] counterparty,
[39:47] uh, completely, you know, decentralized.
[39:49] It's ubiquitous around the world. It's
[39:52] highly liquid. it's a it's a 24/7 365 in
[39:56] terms of uh being able to liquidate it
[39:58] if you need to. Um and so I just think
[40:02] that we're in a world now where we have
[40:04] to be taking that very seriously. I mean
[40:06] we know that uh Europe is uh bringing
[40:09] out their central bank digital
[40:10] currencies in is it October this year?
[40:14] Yeah, it's the first first deadline is
[40:16] is October but it's not like uh it's
[40:20] completely there in October. there's a
[40:21] lot of steps to follow but like the
[40:23] first small steps is in October. So it's
[40:26] always small steps and then it becomes
[40:28] bigger steps and uh but we know that
[40:30] where all this stuff goes and I think
[40:32] Bitcoin was made for this and this is
[40:35] why you know uh I think the sovereignty
[40:37] part is so important and for anybody who
[40:40] doubts that they only really need to go
[40:42] and spend some time listening to uh you
[40:45] know Tony Yasbeck of the Bitcoin way um
[40:48] and you'll get very clear that banks can
[40:51] can fail and do fail. people can lose
[40:53] their life savings. Uh there is such a
[40:56] thing as capital controls. U you know we
[40:58] saw this in uh in uh Cyprus in 2013. We
[41:03] saw it in Lebanon in 2019. Tony was
[41:06] caught up in that in Lebanon. You know
[41:08] we saw some banks fail in Silicon Valley
[41:10] in uh when was that?
[41:13] 2023 uh First Republic Silicon Valley
[41:16] Bank a couple of others. I think that
[41:18] most of those people got their money
[41:20] back through FDIC.
[41:22] However, uh those bailouts, what do they
[41:25] do? They just create more dilution, more
[41:27] currency dilution, more inflation. And
[41:29] so these are all the things we have to
[41:31] take into account now. And and so, you
[41:33] know, I think when it comes to an asset
[41:36] that has the the attributes and the
[41:39] hallmarks of allowing you to actually
[41:42] have absolute ownership of your wealth
[41:44] and to take it anywhere in the world
[41:45] that you choose, whenever you choose. Uh
[41:49] that's a very powerful uh instrument,
[41:52] very powerful technology that I don't
[41:54] think enough people are paying attention
[41:56] to. Um and it's just education. It's
[41:59] just not
[42:00] understanding what they actually own
[42:02] when they buy Bitcoin. You know, they
[42:05] people are good at saying, "Well, hey,
[42:07] I'm going to buy, you know, $2,000,
[42:10] $5,000, $10,000 worth of Bitcoin, and
[42:13] they leave it there on the exchange, and
[42:15] then they forget about it." Or maybe
[42:16] they buy a a hardware wallet, but it
[42:20] takes them six months to get it from the
[42:22] exchange onto their wallet.
[42:25] uh and then they put their seed phrase
[42:27] in their top drawer, you know, and so
[42:29] they're not they're not following all of
[42:31] the steps and and treating their their
[42:35] holding with the with the attention and
[42:37] the the the I guess the respect that it
[42:39] that it deserves because they're not
[42:40] seeing the value of the asset that they
[42:43] hold. And so, um that's why I think the
[42:47] sovereignty thing needs more education.
[42:50] Um, we need to spend as much time
[42:52] talking about what the price of Bitcoin
[42:55] is going to be in 2 years, 5 years, 10
[42:57] years. We need to spend as much time on
[42:59] the but how do you secure it? How do you
[43:03] take it off an exchange? How do you run
[43:05] your own node? How do you, you know,
[43:07] have the right device that's, you know,
[43:10] Bitcoin only and all of those kinds of
[43:13] things, airgapped and, you know, just
[43:15] these little things that people aren't
[43:17] aware of. Uh, and every day I speak to
[43:20] people who had no idea about any of this
[43:22] stuff, you know. So, um, you know, I
[43:25] always say that Bitcoin really promises
[43:27] two things if you study it and you do it
[43:29] right. One is wealth acceleration
[43:32] because we know it's the best performing
[43:34] asset over the last decade and the other
[43:36] is wealth protection, but it only
[43:38] protects your wealth if you take it into
[43:41] self custody and you do it right. Yeah.
[43:44] And you also don't benefit from the
[43:46] valve acceleration if your account gets
[43:48] closed. 100% man. So true. So you you
[43:53] you need both of them uh to to get both
[43:55] of them otherwise you you don't have any
[43:57] of them. Um very true. You mentioned
[44:00] real estate a lot. Um and I it's
[44:02] actually a pattern that I've noticed
[44:04] with Australian
[44:05] Bitcoiners. They they really like uh
[44:08] making the comparison to to real estate.
[44:10] Is it that bad with real estate in
[44:13] Australia? Is it like that that high of
[44:15] a for prices? It all everybody uses
[44:18] savings technology or like why is the
[44:20] focus on real estate that big? Look, we
[44:22] we've all all grown up with the great
[44:25] Australian dream as it's so called and I
[44:28] think they have the same in America. The
[44:30] great American dream is has always been
[44:32] to to own your own home. Um, you know,
[44:36] and and as kids, we're raised uh with a
[44:40] backyard. we can kick the ball around
[44:42] and a set of swings and we're in a a
[44:46] nice comfortable suburb and you know you
[44:49] can survive on one income and uh life's
[44:52] good you know and and back in the late
[44:55] '7s early 80s you know you could buy a
[44:57] house
[44:58] for you know three to four times the
[45:01] average annual
[45:02] wage. Um but now it's like 15 times the
[45:07] average annual wage. And this is why,
[45:09] you know, even if two people, mom and
[45:12] dad, go to work, um it's still not
[45:15] enough, you know, and so people trying
[45:17] to get into the property market now,
[45:18] they've kind of uh they've really
[45:22] they've really missed the boat. And the
[45:23] only way that young people now can get
[45:25] into the market is if they they get an
[45:28] inheritance
[45:30] uh from, you know, their parents um or
[45:33] if the Bank of Mad steps up with a
[45:36] deposit to help them into the property
[45:37] market. But even if they do that,
[45:40] they're going to have a mortgage that is
[45:43] so large that, you know, they're going
[45:45] to be paying it off for the rest of
[45:46] their life, you know, and obviously, you
[45:49] know, if you're in the top 5% of income
[45:51] earners, uh, you know, fair enough, you
[45:54] know, maybe you're going to be okay. But
[45:56] the average person coming out of
[45:58] university in their 20s now uh in Sydney
[46:02] for example, for them to buy uh a a
[46:05] unit, never mind a house, just an
[46:07] apartment, it'll take they've worked out
[46:10] 20 years to uh to save enough for a
[46:13] deposit. So um so this is the problem we
[46:16] have now. We never had this problem 20
[46:19] you never never noticed it up until
[46:20] probably the last 10 years and
[46:22] accelerated through since 2020 with with
[46:26] co
[46:27] um but but now we're in a situation
[46:30] where people are saying and I think
[46:33] Peter Dunworth was saying this the other
[46:35] day on one of his podcasts. was saying
[46:37] that the 100x opportunity with real
[46:41] estate over the last 50 years is now
[46:45] gone. And so the next 100x opportunity
[46:49] is is really what Bitcoin is. And and I
[46:51] know CJ talks about this too and how we
[46:54] we went from financializing
[46:57] gold, going off the gold standard to
[47:00] financializing real estate. And now
[47:03] Bitcoin is going to extract all of the
[47:05] premium, all of the wasted premium in
[47:08] real estate is going to flow into
[47:10] Bitcoin. And uh and and so this is why a
[47:13] lot of people now are sort of saying,
[47:15] well, I'm not sure about this real
[47:17] estate thing anymore. Maybe I'm going to
[47:19] sell a rental property or I'm going to
[47:22] uh think twice about saving up for a
[47:24] house. Maybe I'm just going to buy
[47:26] Bitcoin instead. You know, if you're a
[47:28] young person. So, um, yeah, the whole
[47:31] real estate thing here, it's it's a it's
[47:34] a it's a big issue because we've all
[47:37] felt entitled to have our own home. Um,
[47:41] but unfortunately, there's a whole
[47:42] generation now that just it's not going
[47:44] to be possible. Um, unless they think
[47:47] outside the box. And this is why I teach
[47:49] my kids, I got three daughters in their
[47:52] 20s, to all save a percentage of their
[47:56] income in Bitcoin. And and my goal for
[47:58] them is to get them to that 0.1 as as
[48:01] quickly as they can. Uh because they
[48:04] have time on their side like you, Robin.
[48:05] It's no big deal if they need to wait 10
[48:07] 15 years to buy a home, you know.
[48:11] Do you do you still think that you
[48:14] should buy a home? Let's say not
[48:17] obviously if you're not if 16 is
[48:19] probably bad time to buy a home, but
[48:21] maybe if you're already 35, you already
[48:23] have some uh some Satoshi stacked. Is
[48:26] that still a big thing uh where you're
[48:28] like, "Okay, maybe it's better to just
[48:32] rent and put the money in Bitcoin."
[48:34] Yeah, I think it depends on uh how much
[48:37] Bitcoin you have. Um you know, how
[48:40] comfortable your life is without having
[48:42] a home. Like if you're sharing a house
[48:44] with five people, you know, and it's
[48:46] really important to your life that you
[48:49] uh maybe get your own place and you
[48:51] know, maybe you need to want to start a
[48:53] family or whatever. I mean, we're seeing
[48:56] around where we live now, there's so
[48:58] many people who are sharing and there's
[49:00] like four, five, six people sharing a
[49:04] three-bedroom uh townhouse or or or or a
[49:07] home or old house or apartment. Um, and
[49:12] so I think if you're in that situation,
[49:14] you know, where you like, okay, I really
[49:17] do want a house because for my lifestyle
[49:20] so that I can have some autonomy,
[49:24] privacy, maybe raise a family, whatever
[49:26] it might be, then maybe yeah, you should
[49:28] prioritize uh getting real estate
[49:30] instead. But I think if you've
[49:32] got a 5 to 10 year time horizon
[49:37] uh where it's not going to bother you
[49:39] and you're happy to wait, I would say
[49:41] you're better off putting your your your
[49:43] savings and your capital into Bitcoin
[49:45] because you only need to price real
[49:47] estate in Bitcoin over the past 5 years,
[49:50] 10 years, 15 years. It doesn't matter
[49:52] how far back you go. So long as you
[49:55] choose at least four
[49:56] years, you're going to see that the
[49:58] price of real estate is going like this
[50:01] when priced in Bitcoin. And so the
[50:04] longer you hold on to your Bitcoin, the
[50:05] cheaper the house is going to become.
[50:08] Um, so just it's really a situation
[50:12] dependent on every individual, I guess.
[50:14] But I think the younger you
[50:16] are, the more you should consider
[50:19] waiting until you can more substantially
[50:24] uh be able to have more equity in that
[50:27] house. And the other thing to keep in
[50:30] mind is this space is evolving so
[50:34] rapidly when it comes to uh different
[50:36] lending products and things that are
[50:38] evolving. you know, again, uh, CJ
[50:42] Constantinos, the the people's reserve
[50:44] and companies like Leen and all of that.
[50:47] Like, if you can really build your stack
[50:50] to a a meaningful level over the next
[50:52] few years, then uh, who knows what the
[50:56] opportunity is going to be in 5 10 years
[50:58] for you to to buy real estate. Uh, maybe
[51:02] you won't have to sell your stack if you
[51:03] have the income to service the loan, you
[51:05] know? And it's interesting find out.
[51:07] It's
[51:08] also I mean there's a lot of financial
[51:10] engineering going on but in in general I
[51:13] feel like uh you and then I looked at
[51:16] that actually up uh um can can you buy
[51:20] the the same home that you can buy can
[51:22] you also rent like are there like single
[51:25] family homes uh like I saw it in Austria
[51:27] also to rent and there's a lot of
[51:29] opportunities it's it's all about like
[51:31] the opportunity cost in the end of the
[51:32] day and there's people saying oh yeah
[51:35] but then someone can can kick you out.
[51:38] It's also not that easy when you when
[51:40] you're renting, you have a contract, you
[51:43] have to have a good reason, especially
[51:44] in in countries like Austria. I guess
[51:46] it's similar in Australia that for
[51:49] landlord, it's it's kind of hard to to
[51:51] kick someone really out, especially if
[51:53] they paying rent and not done anything
[51:56] really really bad. But I understand. So
[51:58] for me right now it's if if you
[52:01] emotionally want real estate like then
[52:05] there's there's there's not a chance
[52:06] that you're not buying it anyways. But
[52:09] other than that like financially it does
[52:11] not make sense. If you if you
[52:13] acknowledge that it's financially does
[52:15] not make sense to buy real estate
[52:17] instead of Bitcoin right now then then
[52:20] yeah like go go ahead and and and and do
[52:23] that. But I've met a lot of Bitcoiners
[52:25] that made that same thing and same
[52:28] decision and they all regret it for some
[52:31] reason. Listen, we we bought a piece of
[52:34] real estate uh about 3 years ago.
[52:38] Um and
[52:40] uh it's actually a block of land and
[52:44] it's got two old homes on it that were
[52:46] built in the very early '7s and we're
[52:48] renting them out. So, it's like an an
[52:49] investment, but at some point, we hope
[52:52] to clear the clear the old homes off and
[52:55] build. Um, but if I look at the price of
[52:58] that piece of real estate in Bitcoin in
[53:02] 2023 when we bought it, sorry, 2022
[53:05] compared to
[53:07] now, you know, even though the price has
[53:10] gone up maybe
[53:12] 25% in uh fiat in Australian dollars, uh
[53:16] it's gone down 75% in Bitcoin.
[53:19] So, you know, we would have been better
[53:22] off from an investment p uh perspective
[53:25] to actually put that capital into
[53:28] Bitcoin and right now we'd probably not
[53:31] only have the block of land, we'd also
[53:34] have the house on top of the block of
[53:35] land, you know, and and that. So, it's
[53:38] just these are the things that you
[53:40] realize the longer you're in Bitcoin. uh
[53:43] you you just start to realize, well,
[53:45] hang on, there is no better place to
[53:47] park your your your savings and your
[53:50] capital. And this is why I say anybody
[53:53] who's thinking about buying a house, you
[53:55] just have to think really seriously
[53:57] about um is that really the right
[54:00] decision for you to make today or can
[54:03] you be patient? Is your living
[54:05] arrangement good enough for you to be
[54:08] able to still put up with it for the
[54:10] next 5 years or so?
[54:13] because I believe we've just got so much
[54:15] ahead of us with uh with with Bitcoin
[54:18] and the financialization of it as an
[54:21] asset class and all the options that
[54:23] we're going to have as
[54:25] Bitcoiners. Um so just be patient if you
[54:28] can, you know, that's the main thing.
[54:31] Absolutely. And and there are some
[54:32] people that always bring up that we yeah
[54:36] it's easy to say like the past 5 years
[54:37] past 10 years because the the growth has
[54:40] been really good and people feel for
[54:42] some reason this 100k mark is late
[54:44] because it's just looks so much bigger
[54:47] than 10k or like 1k but the same thing
[54:50] was true for people that looked from
[54:53] $100 to $1,000. They thought they're
[54:56] super late at $1,000.
[54:59] So it's it's it's really it's really
[55:01] interesting how much psychology is
[55:04] playing a part in in those financial
[55:06] decision and you oh I'm so late to
[55:08] Bitcoin and it's it's almost at 100K.
[55:11] That's so true. And but you know then
[55:13] you listen to again someone like Peter
[55:16] Dunworth or Jeff Booth you know and
[55:18] someone says to Jeff the other day on a
[55:20] on a interview so Jeff what's the what's
[55:23] the true uh value of Bitcoin today in
[55:25] fiat dollars? and he says, "Oh, 43
[55:28] million." And they say, "Well, how do
[55:30] you come up with that?" Well, there's
[55:32] 900 trillion worth of assets in the
[55:34] world. Divide by 21 million, that's 43
[55:37] million. So, if Bitcoin is the true free
[55:41] market, the true first global free
[55:43] market that we've ever had, like like he
[55:45] keeps saying, and it and it's just going
[55:47] to keep repricing everything. Uh then
[55:52] eventually, he's basically saying that's
[55:54] why you have to look at Bitcoin as the
[55:56] only free market. And so, you take all
[55:58] the assets on Earth, you divide it by 21
[56:00] million, even though we don't have 21
[56:02] million because what is it? 4,000 or so
[56:06] lost forever. But yeah, so it's it's
[56:08] fascinating to think about that. It's
[56:10] not easy to get your head around, but uh
[56:13] but you know, I think that as time goes
[56:16] on, he's going to be proven right. You
[56:18] know, it's uh because Bitcoin is just
[56:21] going to continue to
[56:23] absorb all of the
[56:25] premium and the and and the and the
[56:27] financial uh energy out of all of these
[56:30] other asset classes as people realize,
[56:33] well, it's scarce. Absolutely scarce.
[56:35] It's fixed. It's finite. The rules can't
[56:37] be changed.
[56:39] Um it's it's just it's just going to eat
[56:42] everything.
[56:44] Absolutely. Um I have one question to
[56:46] ask each and every one of my guests and
[56:48] the question is what can we learn from
[56:51] you besides Bitcoin? Um what can you
[56:53] learn from me besides
[56:55] Bitcoin? Uh I mean I spent 15 years uh
[57:01] in in the alternative health space. So a
[57:05] lot of uh what we used to share at our
[57:07] workshops was very much around being
[57:11] uh self-s sovereign from a health
[57:13] perspective. Uh so not entrusting your
[57:16] health to the medical system. Uh you
[57:18] know being self-responsible and have a
[57:20] pre preventative type mindset around
[57:23] health. Um, so yeah, probably just that
[57:25] just to to understand that um, you know,
[57:30] Bitcoin is a way for us to be self-
[57:31] sovereign in our money, but we also need
[57:33] to be self- sovereign in the way that we
[57:35] take care of our health and our body.
[57:37] And I think that there's a beautiful um,
[57:40] synergy between both because at the end
[57:42] of the day with Bitcoin, what are we
[57:45] really trying to do? Uh, we're trying to
[57:48] sort of take back or reclaim the future,
[57:50] right? So we're all looking forward to a
[57:52] brighter future. the longer that we're
[57:54] in Bitcoin, but there's no point uh if
[57:58] you know it comes at the expense of our
[58:00] health or or not taking care of ourself.
[58:02] And so uh I like to think that as
[58:06] Bitcoiners, the future's bright. Um, but
[58:09] that means we've got to really pay
[58:11] attention to doing all the right things
[58:13] from a health and wellness uh
[58:14] perspective so that um uh when we get to
[58:18] this beautiful place where we're all
[58:20] going to end up uh we've got plenty of
[58:22] life left in us left in us to enjoy it.
[58:25] I I couldn't agree more. Thank you so
[58:28] much. That that that's really really a
[58:29] good message. Um, we have Andrew as you
[58:32] know in the podcast where the previous
[58:33] guest is asking a question for the next
[58:35] guest without knowing who the next guest
[58:36] actually is. And the question from the
[58:39] previous guest is what price would you
[58:42] pay to store information online forever?
[58:46] What sort of
[58:47] information? Um, I think if it cames if
[58:50] it comes to uh to sensitive information
[58:54] regarding to Bitcoin, I' I'd pretty much
[58:56] pay uh pay any price. But um I'm not
[59:00] quite sure what the context of the
[59:02] question is, but
[59:03] uh but I can only think there's really
[59:06] nothing online that uh would be
[59:10] absolutely life-changing for me that I'd
[59:12] need to preserve. So other than probably
[59:15] some sensitive information relating to
[59:17] Bitcoin. Yeah. And that's you you don't
[59:19] want to uh also maybe not want to uh
[59:23] store online forever.
[59:25] No, no, no. But sort of yeah, arms
[59:28] length stuff. But yeah, no, I I
[59:31] um I can't really think of uh something
[59:33] that
[59:34] I'd spend a crazy amount of money to to
[59:38] uh keep online. Very very true. Really
[59:40] cool. Perfect. Then uh thank you so much
[59:42] uh Sane for for for being on the
[59:45] podcast. Um before I let you go, where
