[00:00] one trillion is just a random number
[00:01] that I used to get a point across which
[00:03] is that Bitcoin will not be able to be
[00:06] traded for dollars anymore we're going
[00:07] to end up with hyperbitcoinization and
[00:09] and essentially a price of Infinity a
[00:11] trillion dollars will be unable to buy a
[00:13] Bitcoin before the end of the Decades
[00:15] you've got 21 million chairs that are
[00:19] available and then you've got the entire
[00:21] world circling those chairs like you
[00:24] would in a game of musical chairs as the
[00:26] people walking around are noticing that
[00:28] more and more people are starting to sit
[00:30] down in these chairs and there's less
[00:32] and less chairs available it accelerates
[00:34] at some point there's got to be an event
[00:36] where everybody's panicking and rushing
[00:39] for the remaining
[00:40] [Music]
[00:44] chairs you you told me that you're from
[00:46] Austin Texas it seems to be a really
[00:49] vibrant Bitcoin Community I heard last
[00:51] time uh how is how is things now in
[00:53] Austin Texas how things in America uh
[00:56] how how was that year also for you
[00:57] because be recording now on 18th of
[00:59] December this episode will probably come
[01:01] out like very close to New Year's Eve
[01:04] maybe even like already in
[01:06] 2025 um what are some of your highlights
[01:09] and how was that year with the election
[01:11] and Trump and
[01:13] everything yeah Vibes are high out here
[01:16] um in uh in the Unchained Offices here
[01:19] in Austin Texas uh we've got a lot of
[01:23] people that that that work in the office
[01:26] we've got uh the Bitcoin Commons down
[01:28] the hall which is kind of like like the
[01:30] main meeting place for Bitcoin here in
[01:32] Austin we also have a ple lab uh here in
[01:36] in the uh the same building so it's a
[01:39] great place for bitcoiners to come and
[01:42] coales and and talk about things and I
[01:45] would say that yeah you know with the
[01:48] with the price going up and with um
[01:50] potentially some some uh benefits coming
[01:54] from uh the regulatory side in America
[01:58] like everybody's really excited and busy
[02:02] um 2024 has been a big year but I think
[02:05] pretty much everyone is expecting 2025
[02:07] to be even
[02:09] bigger absolutely I think that the next
[02:11] year will be really crazy and and you
[02:15] casually like I asked you like if if you
[02:17] have any topics that you want to talk
[02:19] about and you casually throw in a number
[02:21] of one
[02:23] trillion most people uh see like the
[02:26] content seems to be like we will hit the
[02:28] million dollars of fitcoin before 2030
[02:31] around that the time frame even like
[02:33] really big institutions kind of agree on
[02:35] those numbers um and you throw out a
[02:38] number of one trillion US Dollars uh
[02:42] there are so many interesting questions
[02:43] with that but why why do you come to
[02:45] that conclusion and and
[02:47] how yeah so one trillion is just kind of
[02:51] a a a random number that I used to get a
[02:53] point across which is that uh in my view
[02:57] you know uh Bitcoin will not be able to
[03:01] be traded for dollars anymore right
[03:03] we're going to end up with
[03:04] hyperbitcoinization and and essentially
[03:07] a price of Infinity at at some point um
[03:11] I did kind of write an article just uh
[03:14] outside of work just thinking about this
[03:16] stuff and that's where that's where I
[03:18] wrote down the the trillion number um
[03:22] the the main point of that article was
[03:25] to uh kind of focus on the question of
[03:29] how soon that will happen um and my view
[03:34] is that it will happen sooner than a lot
[03:37] of people think um my I I presented it
[03:41] as like a trillion dollars will be
[03:44] unable to buy a Bitcoin before the end
[03:46] of the decade um and of course nobody
[03:48] knows for sure but I was kind of
[03:50] thinking through uh the reasons of uh
[03:54] why I think it'll be more of a
[03:58] acceleration to the UPS side rather than
[04:00] like the alternative Theory which is
[04:02] also popular of like kind of diminishing
[04:05] returns over
[04:07] time yeah the diminishing returns I
[04:09] don't buy
[04:10] it I don't like I I don't know how fast
[04:14] but diminishing return seems to be
[04:18] uh most people don't realize that
[04:21] Bitcoin is something absolute scares and
[04:24] it's digital it's globally available uh
[04:26] and 8 billion people have an incentive
[04:29] to join that Network even though maybe
[04:31] they don't are not aware of yet uh and
[04:34] we never had such a a situation so
[04:37] anyways every every prediction every
[04:40] speculation is is kind of valid be
[04:43] because we don't know like there there's
[04:46] no arguments against it but there's also
[04:48] no real argument before it but I think
[04:51] diminishing returns doesn't make sense
[04:53] for me at all right likewise I so it
[04:58] when I was thinking through this I was
[05:00] trying to compare it to um to like a
[05:04] game so trying to figure out what
[05:06] analogy really fits for describing what
[05:10] is happening over the course of Bitcoin
[05:12] adoption just in the world um and I
[05:17] think the game that uh that fits the
[05:21] best would be musical chairs right so uh
[05:26] basically you've got 21 million chairs
[05:31] that are available which is the Bitcoin
[05:33] Supply and then you've got the entire um
[05:38] world circling those chairs like you
[05:40] would in in a game of musical
[05:43] chairs um and so the goal of the game is
[05:49] essentially well first the rules of the
[05:51] game are that there there are only 21
[05:54] million chairs um and that kind of
[05:58] everybody in the world has a similar
[06:01] goal which is to be able to save value
[06:05] across time so everybody wants to save
[06:09] value across time um and when people
[06:12] want to do something they need to look
[06:14] for the best tool for the job so that's
[06:18] kind of rule number two is that uh that
[06:20] everybody wants the best tool for what
[06:22] they're trying to accomplish um and then
[06:24] the the third rule of the game is that
[06:27] Bitcoin is the best tool all right so
[06:28] then you put all those rules together
[06:30] and and you you get with what a lot of
[06:32] people think which is that everybody's
[06:35] going to want Bitcoin um so the goal of
[06:38] the game is kind of how many chairs that
[06:42] different entities in the world can uh
[06:44] can kind of sit down and lock up for
[06:48] themselves um and in musical chairs you
[06:52] also have music going on in the
[06:53] background which is uh the analogy there
[06:56] would be like that's the current
[06:59] Financial system is is that that we're
[07:02] in now is basically the quiet music in
[07:05] the background a lot of people are not
[07:07] really paying attention to it yet um but
[07:11] uh increasingly when you kind of look
[07:14] into the problems of how the current
[07:16] system works you start to actually
[07:18] notice the music more and you also start
[07:20] to notice that the music's not going to
[07:22] last forever um and so to uh to prevent
[07:27] yourself from losing this game of
[07:29] musical chairs people need to to take
[07:32] their seats um and and that amounts to
[07:37] to buying Bitcoin otherwise you lose the
[07:40] game this analogy I think is um is
[07:45] helpful for kind of imagining what the
[07:49] future of adoption could look like
[07:53] because you uh in musical chairs the end
[07:57] of the game it's never really people
[07:59] kind of walking over gradually to to
[08:01] take their seats right that that's kind
[08:03] of the diminishing returns theory that
[08:07] uh as more and more people are sitting
[08:09] down and there's less and less seats
[08:11] available that um people are going to be
[08:14] less eager to take the remaining seats
[08:17] uh whereas the the other side of the the
[08:22] other opposing theory is that as the
[08:25] people walking around are noticing that
[08:27] more and more people are starting to sit
[08:29] down in these chairs and there's less
[08:31] and less chairs available they start to
[08:34] um you know figure that they should they
[08:37] should get some in case it catches on
[08:39] basically uh and and then it
[08:41] accelerates so that trillion dollar is
[08:44] kind of the moment where the Music Stops
[08:47] and everyone has to sit down but they're
[08:50] not they're not enough
[08:52] chairs right like I think at some point
[08:55] there's got to be an event horizon so to
[08:59] speak
[08:59] where uh everybody's kind of panicking
[09:03] and rushing for the the remaining
[09:06] chairs um so again the question is just
[09:10] does that happen uh 50 years from now or
[09:13] does it happen uh you know in the next
[09:16] few
[09:17] years um and the way that I look at it
[09:22] is
[09:23] that uh there are many different
[09:26] categories of players in this game of
[09:29] musical chairs so you've got just
[09:31] regular individuals like you and me and
[09:34] the people listening um you've got uh
[09:38] companies you've got organizations
[09:41] you've got
[09:42] governments and I
[09:44] think the people that are expecting this
[09:47] to play out over let's say two decades
[09:50] or three
[09:51] decades uh a lot of those folks are kind
[09:55] of looking at the fact that a lot of the
[09:58] capital in the world is held by um kind
[10:01] of the baby boomer generation and stuff
[10:04] so so people that are retired they make
[10:07] up a big portion of the population they
[10:09] have a lot of the world's capital and a
[10:11] lot of them are just not interested in
[10:13] learning about Bitcoin uh so if you're
[10:16] looking at that and you're focusing on
[10:18] that kind of player group um it it makes
[10:21] sense to kind of conclude that it's
[10:23] going to take a while for Bitcoin to uh
[10:26] really dominate the financial system of
[10:29] the world it you know kind of morbid but
[10:31] it might it might uh take that uh you
[10:34] know a lot of those people in the older
[10:37] Generations uh have passed on and then
[10:40] some people that are younger that
[10:41] actually grew up with Bitcoin they will
[10:44] kind of it will make more sense for
[10:46] Bitcoin to be prominent uh when when
[10:49] most of the capital is in the hands of
[10:51] the younger generation so that's that's
[10:53] kind of the one that's kind of like the
[10:55] the slow Theory um but I do think that
[11:00] that is wrong because it's not applying
[11:04] the correct levels of importance across
[11:07] the the different player groups that I
[11:10] mentioned um in particular the player
[11:14] group that is most relevant would be the
[11:19] governments um and that's really just
[11:22] because they have access to the money
[11:24] printers right so uh of course there is
[11:28] a lot of capital in the world held by
[11:30] regular
[11:31] individuals but that's
[11:33] finite governments that have money
[11:36] printers um theoretically have infinite
[11:39] currencies so they have you could say
[11:42] almost infinite more influence than than
[11:45] just regular
[11:47] individuals and so I'm looking at this
[11:49] and I'm uh just theorizing that if
[11:54] Washington DC and Beijing and Moscow Etc
[11:58] get into a bit of a competition in terms
[12:01] of how many seats in the game of musical
[12:04] chairs that they can
[12:05] accumulate then it really doesn't matter
[12:08] whether the other player groups are are
[12:10] ready for this to happen right you could
[12:12] have 80% of the world that knows very
[12:15] little about Bitcoin is very not
[12:16] interested in Bitcoin and yet still kind
[12:20] of just through the through economic
[12:23] reality they will uh they will need to
[12:27] um they'll need to start taking
[12:29] their seats because
[12:32] otherwise they essentially lose this
[12:34] this game um so yeah essentially it
[12:38] boils down to if money printers start
[12:41] being deployed to accumulate Bitcoin uh
[12:46] that's where I believe this event
[12:47] horizon is and and the game's pretty
[12:49] much over at that point or very close to
[12:53] over so the the the point comes towards
[12:56] uh nation state game theory or maybe
[12:59] even like Central Bank Game Theory which
[13:03] is kind of connected to each other um I
[13:07] mean then this year has been the first
[13:11] real indicator uh the first kind of
[13:14] proof that that that that will happen
[13:16] quite quickly um even though it remains
[13:19] to be seen if the the pill in in America
[13:22] passes having happens because yeah it's
[13:25] great that uh El Salvador is buying
[13:28] Bitcoin uh
[13:30] but but Micro strategy is buying way
[13:32] more Bitcoin than El Salvador uh so the
[13:35] buying power of El Salvador is is not
[13:38] that huge and they're not going that
[13:40] deep in there bu uh Budan is is buying
[13:43] Bitcoin that's a really really small
[13:46] country like extremely small there there
[13:48] are cities in Austria that are bigger
[13:50] than than than uh than that country
[13:54] so uh a nation state like uh the us
[13:59] entering in or Russia seeing that that
[14:03] really makes a difference uh and this
[14:05] this year was was this year kind of the
[14:08] the start for for that yeah yeah I think
[14:10] so so
[14:12] um the question of
[14:15] like uh why will it why will it uh
[14:19] happen sooner rather than later that
[14:21] that governments start accumulating
[14:24] Bitcoin um well first of all I do want
[14:27] to mention that like El Vador is one of
[14:30] the countries that does not have access
[14:31] to a money printer right that's actually
[14:33] a big uh a big deal because if they did
[14:37] who knows what they'd be doing with it
[14:38] right now you know maybe they would they
[14:40] would be uh uh completely destroying it
[14:43] to to get more
[14:45] Bitcoin um but in terms of
[14:49] like why why it why I'm thinking that
[14:52] this will all occur potentially even
[14:54] before the end of the decade is really
[14:57] that as the game goes on it becomes
[15:00] increasingly evident that the game
[15:03] exists to the people that have been on
[15:05] the outside right so again if we use
[15:07] that analogy of people just kind of
[15:09] walking around and circling the chairs
[15:12] the people that haven't taken their
[15:14] seats yet are the people that are um
[15:16] kind of trying to ignore the game
[15:19] they're they're thinking oh this is not
[15:20] a serious game um and so you know I
[15:24] don't need to use my my wealth my
[15:27] purchasing power to accumulate any of
[15:29] these chairs it doesn't it doesn't
[15:31] matter but as the game goes on and as
[15:35] you have uh people like the president of
[15:38] the United States and congressman and uh
[15:42] you know leaders of other countries um
[15:46] big financial institutions Fidelity
[15:48] Black Rock Etc when they're all starting
[15:51] to um put their eyeballs on this game a
[15:55] little bit more and talk about it in a
[15:57] serious light I think that's where it
[16:00] just becomes harder and harder to ignore
[16:02] for everyone um and that's and
[16:07] increasingly harder to ignore is the the
[16:09] key Point um so it's sort of like a SN
[16:13] The Snowball Effect where uh it just
[16:16] gets bigger and bigger and bigger um as
[16:19] it goes and you know we just passed
[16:23] $100,000 per Bitcoin that was a big
[16:26] milestone certainly um I think the
[16:30] longer Bitcoin has survived the more
[16:33] that uh people realize that it's not
[16:36] going away the more it keeps going up
[16:39] people realize that it's not going
[16:41] away and um just increasingly they
[16:47] people want to get some in case it
[16:49] catches on and it's very evident that
[16:51] it's catching on what what role do you
[16:54] think those priz Milestones as we just
[16:56] hit uh the 100K a few weeks ago uh what
[17:01] what meaning do those price Milestones
[17:05] really
[17:06] carry that's a good question
[17:09] so um I think what it primarily does is
[17:14] it it proves wrong the people that said
[17:18] it was never going to happen and that
[17:21] kind of diminishes their credibility in
[17:23] the eyes of others it also just
[17:26] hopefully causes some of those people
[17:27] who were saying it was never going to
[17:29] hit 100,000 hopefully causes them to
[17:31] kind of reassess their um their
[17:35] preconceived notions right their the uh
[17:39] the the facts that they're using to to
[17:41] predict that um so I think that's the
[17:45] biggest thing is that it it
[17:49] just what what people have said is never
[17:52] going to happen happened um those same
[17:56] people that that told us that it would
[17:59] happen are telling us that it's going to
[18:02] continue because the facts haven't
[18:04] changed it's still the best money um
[18:06] people are still going to be interested
[18:08] in converting inferior money into
[18:11] Bitcoin um so there's no reason to think
[18:13] that this is going to to stop or reverse
[18:17] as far as I can
[18:18] tell that's very true um one thing I
[18:21] think about right now when we think okay
[18:24] we have the1 trillion dollar we have to
[18:26] have a bit cination point uh and uh the
[18:30] the music will stop sooner rather than
[18:32] later um but right now we are still at
[18:37] just 100K uh not a lot of people have
[18:40] Bitcoin even less people have self
[18:43] custody even less people have experience
[18:45] with lightning even less people have
[18:47] experience with all those things um what
[18:50] what do you think is there a danger in
[18:54] we scaling too quickly uh from like zero
[18:58] to like 100 where uh we we don't we
[19:02] didn't build out the infrastructure
[19:04] enough uh the the education is not
[19:07] enough uh and it's just like we the it's
[19:11] kind of like the the the danic is
[19:14] sinking too quick and the live boat is
[19:16] not ready
[19:18] yet yes yes so that that's a a really
[19:21] important question because um it's
[19:24] important to distinguish you know what I
[19:27] think is going to happen from you know
[19:29] what I would like to happen right like
[19:33] um I do think that if adoption moves
[19:36] forward too quickly that a lot of the
[19:40] population of the world is uh
[19:44] potentially initially going to be
[19:46] negatively affected by it because a lot
[19:49] of people especially you know in in uh
[19:52] kind of developed Western countries like
[19:54] the United States and Europe they have a
[19:56] lot of their savings and their their
[19:59] value storage in mechanisms that are not
[20:02] Bitcoin and potentially um that would
[20:05] prove to be a mistake as as a lot of
[20:08] there'd be a lot of capital flight from
[20:10] those assets towards Bitcoin um and yeah
[20:14] unfortunately a lot of people that that
[20:16] have not been taking Bitcoin seriously
[20:19] uh could you know be be negatively
[20:22] affected in terms of their kind of
[20:24] wealth and
[20:26] savings um
[20:29] and yeah what I'm saying is that like I
[20:34] think that that could still be the case
[20:38] right that could still be what happens
[20:40] um unfortunately like I think that if
[20:44] nation states do start printing money to
[20:47] accumulate Bitcoin uh then um then a lot
[20:52] of the Bitcoin will end up in the in the
[20:54] hands of the state and not just regular
[20:56] individuals and uh uh that that might
[20:59] not be ideal so someone might prefer um
[21:04] a slower adoption um just not sure that
[21:07] that will happen on the bright side I I
[21:09] would point out that there are some
[21:11] interesting things occurring right now
[21:13] that are sort of getting uh getting
[21:17] Bitcoin exposure into the hands of
[21:19] people that uh that were not necessarily
[21:23] seeking Bitcoin exposure so what I'm
[21:26] referring to here is stuff like micr
[21:28] strategy being added to the uh the
[21:29] NASDAQ 100 just the other day so a lot
[21:33] of people own um the the the QQQ right
[21:36] the NASDAQ 100 ETF a lot of people in
[21:39] America own that um and so you know I
[21:43] think it it finally settles maybe in a
[21:46] in a week or something like that but
[21:48] suddenly all of those people have some
[21:50] sort of small allocation to to micr
[21:53] strategy and you know it's a couple of
[21:55] degrees removed from Bitcoin but uh but
[21:57] they do
[21:59] essentially have some sort of Bitcoin
[22:01] exposure so I think it's quite possible
[22:04] that stuff like that can um uh becomes
[22:09] more and more common more companies
[22:11] adopt Bitcoin more people own these
[22:13] companies more people passively own
[22:15] these
[22:16] ETFs and so that could be kind of a
[22:18] Saving Grace amongst the people that
[22:20] that have really been trying to ignore
[22:24] Bitcoin um that they they could just
[22:27] kind of get some exposure
[22:29] accidentally uh throughout this adoption
[22:32] process but if they do they really own
[22:35] it uh if they have like an IOU of an IU
[22:39] basically uh and uh in in a in a moment
[22:44] where the uh currency that we are
[22:48] denominating things in is kind of
[22:50] completely going
[22:52] away it's also interesting how the stock
[22:55] market will then behave because uh you
[22:58] you you don't want to sell your your
[23:00] like stocks are all denominated in US
[23:03] dollars or local
[23:04] currencies but what what if all the
[23:07] currencies are hyper inflating and you
[23:09] don't want any of that anymore see they
[23:14] are very interesting questions in there
[23:16] and and a lot of questions also from me
[23:18] if if it actually helps having
[23:22] Prader a broader audience uh to bitcoin
[23:27] with micro strategy proxies with uh ETF
[23:31] proxies with maybe like Pension funds
[23:34] proxies and stuff like that rather than
[23:37] how many people have Bitcoin in a self-
[23:41] custody way and and I think there there
[23:42] are very few of them like even even in
[23:46] the Bitcoin crowd that that that are uh
[23:50] active in Bitcoin I think the Bitcoin
[23:52] self custody crowd is like way smaller
[23:55] than than we actually think yeah um yeah
[23:58] I would agree with that it's kind of an
[24:00] interesting question in terms of uh kind
[24:03] of the idea that I just covered if
[24:05] people accidentally get like pseudo
[24:08] exposure to bitcoin uh will they be able
[24:11] to kind of con convert that into real
[24:14] Bitcoin in some way down the road you
[24:17] can imagine a possible scenario where um
[24:22] uh people are owning micr strategy
[24:24] through the QQQ it's it's going up in
[24:26] dollar terms and eventually
[24:29] uh they you know understand that they
[24:31] can sell some of that and then use the
[24:35] the dollars to go and get real Bitcoin
[24:38] and they've they've kind of been almost
[24:41] keeping Pace with Bitcoin up until that
[24:43] point but you you rais a point of like
[24:45] uh maybe that's that's not um that
[24:48] bridge is not possible um I guess
[24:52] another possibility is that uh some of
[24:56] these companies that are accumulating
[24:57] Bitcoin potentially they eventually uh
[25:01] start issuing dividends in Bitcoin as a
[25:04] way to for people to get real Bitcoin if
[25:07] they own uh a share of the company um
[25:11] it's really hard to know uh what what
[25:13] what will happen there um so I think
[25:16] that that's a maybe a good segue to talk
[25:18] a little bit more about self- custody
[25:20] and and why it's so important um that's
[25:22] really what I uh help people do at
[25:26] Unchained um I didn't really uh
[25:29] introduced myself very well at the
[25:30] beginning uh of this but uh but yeah I
[25:33] work at unchain I've worked at unchain
[25:34] for the the past three years um and for
[25:39] anyone listening who is not familiar
[25:42] with Unchained it's a Bitcoin Focus
[25:44] Financial Service Company we're based in
[25:47] in the United States and the financial
[25:49] services that we are focused on are also
[25:52] focused um in the United States um and
[25:57] ultimately we we have several different
[25:59] financial services that we offer but
[26:00] really the main one is helping people
[26:02] secure real Bitcoin right as opposed to
[26:05] ETFs so um self- custody holding your
[26:10] keys Etc that's really what I've been
[26:14] doing at at unchain for the past three
[26:16] years uh my job has been to work with
[26:20] people who are interested in protecting
[26:23] Bitcoin for for the long term
[26:26] potentially Generations
[26:28] and a lot of people are interested in
[26:30] doing that but they have no idea where
[26:32] to start um they uh they understand that
[26:36] they should take their Bitcoin out of
[26:39] the exchange where they bought it
[26:40] because otherwise they they just have an
[26:42] IOU like you mentioned it's uh it's
[26:45] really just um paper Bitcoin so famously
[26:49] not your keys not your coins people need
[26:51] to hold their own
[26:53] Keys um and then people kind of discover
[26:56] that the way to do that is is use using
[26:58] a hardware wallet that can help you keep
[27:01] your private Keys completely
[27:03] offline um but still there's a lot of
[27:05] confusion around Hardware wallets
[27:07] there's a lot of nervousness um if
[27:10] people have never touched one of these
[27:12] devices before because
[27:15] uh you people are worried about the fact
[27:18] that they could they could lose
[27:19] something right some some item could get
[27:21] stolen if they're responsible for their
[27:23] Bitcoin and self- custody uh what
[27:26] happens if their Hardware wallet breaks
[27:28] what happens if their seed phrase goes
[27:30] missing Etc so so unchains really
[27:33] focused on multisig which is the ability
[27:37] to um have multiple different Keys
[27:40] protecting the Bitcoin such that uh
[27:42] single points of failure are eliminated
[27:45] you know not just with your custodian
[27:46] but with your self- custody you could
[27:48] lose any particular item and still have
[27:51] an Avenue for recovering your Bitcoin
[27:53] your Bitcoin would still be safe um so
[27:57] uh so yeah I wanted to kind of cover a
[28:00] little bit about what I do and how I
[28:02] think about um protecting Bitcoin the
[28:05] correct
[28:06] way I think that's super important to
[28:09] because there there's also so many ways
[28:12] you you can do that and I think we we
[28:15] kind of have to get the self- custody
[28:17] basis in into the podcast always to like
[28:20] see like hey we have do do self custody
[28:24] otherwise you you might not benefit even
[28:27] from uh the number go up like there's
[28:29] like number go up technology and there's
[28:31] Freedom go up technology uh and if
[28:34] you're just focusing the one you might
[28:36] lose
[28:38] both you might might you lose both in an
[28:42] idea world uh yes micro strategy uh will
[28:46] be converted uh to bitcoin one day your
[28:49] stocks maybe even starting paying
[28:51] dividends in Bitcoin would be super
[28:53] interesting if micro strategy uh does
[28:55] things like that uh but maybe they won't
[28:59] maybe they can't like who who knows uh
[29:03] what world are we entering if if coming
[29:06] back to to the beginning of those seats
[29:08] not available for people uh then we
[29:11] really have to have self- custody that's
[29:13] the only way you can make sure you have
[29:16] Bitcoin in the future if if you have a
[29:19] proxy or an exchange or anything else
[29:21] you you're not sure if you actually have
[29:23] Bitcoin in the
[29:24] future that's right um really the dor of
[29:28] what brings people to Bitcoin in the
[29:30] first place is trying to reduce future
[29:33] uncertainty right um what makes Bitcoin
[29:36] the best savings tool is that we we know
[29:41] what Bitcoin is going to look like uh
[29:44] you know five years from now 10 years
[29:46] from now 100 years from now a thousand
[29:47] years from now and people can't say that
[29:50] about anything else gold dollars Etc um
[29:54] and so if people in if people people are
[29:58] trying to hold Bitcoin purely through
[30:00] these other mechanisms like uh getting
[30:03] exposure through micro strategy and
[30:05] stuff um you're definitely kind of uh
[30:10] introducing more uncertainty into uh
[30:13] into your setup because there's a a
[30:15] variety of factors just related to micro
[30:18] strategy that are not specific to
[30:19] bitcoin uh that you have to contend with
[30:22] at that point um so I'm a big believer
[30:26] that you know people can do whatever
[30:28] they want and and own whatever kind of
[30:29] assets they they want to own but if
[30:32] someone really wants a a foundation like
[30:35] a financial foundation for themselves
[30:38] that has the least future uncertainty uh
[30:41] you do need real Bitcoin and you do need
[30:44] um to not be uh beholden to someone else
[30:48] that is holding that Bitcoin for you
[30:50] that's that that just introduces
[30:52] additional risk that uh that you don't
[30:54] need I partnered up with coin vigilante
[30:59] this is the most beautiful Bitcoin time
[31:02] piece that I ever saw created by anyone
[31:05] look at that beauty I love it so much
[31:07] coin vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin
[31:10] watch that's the perfect subtle elegent
[31:13] way to go out there and show that you
[31:16] are a bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[31:19] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just
[31:22] dropped a completely new and amazing
[31:25] Genesis edition of their watch
[31:28] collections you have the date of the
[31:30] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[31:33] and of course also the block height and
[31:36] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[31:39] the level of detail they put in in this
[31:42] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[31:44] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[31:47] down in the descriptions I love those
[31:50] watches so so much if you watch or
[31:53] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[31:55] I'll guess you already bought some
[31:58] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[32:00] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[32:04] in a hardware wallet my personal
[32:05] recommendation for harder wallet is the
[32:08] bitbox it's super secure it's simple to
[32:10] set up it's also perfect gift for a
[32:12] friend who has still the Bitcoin on an
[32:15] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[32:19] with the code Robin at the checkout
[32:21] visit bitbox do Swiss robobin to get
[32:25] your bitbox and the next step is to
[32:27] really level up your sovereignty as an
[32:30] individual you have to have the most
[32:32] secure self- custody setup you have to
[32:35] secure your own devices you have to
[32:38] protect your privacy you have to set up
[32:41] an inheritance plan and depending on
[32:43] where you live you even want to have a
[32:45] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[32:48] in case something goes really really
[32:50] wrong and through all those steps the
[32:52] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[32:55] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[32:57] way.com SLP Partners robobin you even
[33:01] get a 30 minute free call to find out
[33:04] how you can level up your sovereignty
[33:07] absolutely really cool um maybe uh you
[33:10] covered a little bit but uh maybe let's
[33:13] go through the option what people have
[33:14] in in self custody I think you're also
[33:17] really good in in like just showing up
[33:18] like okay what single s multi and all
[33:21] the different variations of of that uh
[33:24] maybe can you can give us a base layer
[33:27] of understanding
[33:28] what you're looking at and what are the
[33:29] the challenges towards that yeah
[33:32] absolutely and and maybe before I get
[33:35] into that I I do want to mention that a
[33:37] lot of these Solutions we have right now
[33:40] are probably going to be a bit different
[33:42] from what we have going forward uh
[33:45] there's a there's a uh we could maybe
[33:47] get into it a little bit later but um
[33:52] self- custody we just talked about the
[33:53] importance of that but it's kind of
[33:55] getting more and more rest restrictive
[33:58] in terms of who can self custody due to
[34:01] the nature of how Bitcoin currently
[34:04] works and the tools that we have
[34:05] available but we'll just set that aside
[34:07] for a moment and focus on what people
[34:09] can do right now um with the current
[34:12] level adoption that we have um so like I
[34:17] was mentioning earlier kind of Step
[34:19] number one after someone buys Bitcoin is
[34:23] recognizing that uh that they they are
[34:26] trusting a custodian to hold that
[34:27] Bitcoin for them and um a big barrier I
[34:33] think like a psychological barrier for
[34:35] people in that position is that that
[34:37] model feels very familiar to them
[34:40] because they kind of are doing that with
[34:42] their their dollars or their Euros in a
[34:45] traditional bank account someone's
[34:46] holding that for them same thing with
[34:49] like stocks at a brokerage they're using
[34:51] um The Brokerage to to hold the stocks
[34:53] for them so it kind of just makes
[34:55] intuitive sense to a lot of people that
[34:58] okay well I'm going to buy a Bitcoin on
[35:00] uh on any given exchange and that
[35:02] exchange is going to hold that Bitcoin
[35:04] for me the key difference of course is
[35:07] that um if a Traditional Bank loses your
[35:11] Fiat or if a brokerage loses your stock
[35:15] um it's it's insured and uh the
[35:18] government could print more money to
[35:20] give to you um whereas if a Bitcoin
[35:22] custodian loses your Bitcoin nobody's
[35:24] creating more Bitcoin to give to you so
[35:27] you've got uh substantially more
[35:29] custodial risk that is the driver that
[35:33] people need to realize of why they
[35:34] should get their Bitcoin off the
[35:36] exchange um and out of the hands of a
[35:38] custodian to do that um that involves
[35:42] self- custody all Bitcoin is protected
[35:45] by keys so whoever holds the keys is the
[35:47] real owner of the Bitcoin so if you want
[35:49] to be the real owner of your Bitcoin you
[35:51] got to hold your own
[35:52] keys and
[35:55] um single Sig is the
[35:58] kind of uh original and easiest way to
[36:02] do that single Sig is where there's just
[36:06] one key involved and so uh you move your
[36:09] Bitcoin to addresses protected by that
[36:12] one key and then if you hold that key uh
[36:16] you've you've got the Bitcoin the
[36:19] problem with that very simplistic model
[36:22] is the single points of failure because
[36:25] if somebody else finds your key
[36:28] that's all that they need to be able to
[36:29] access the Bitcoin on those
[36:31] addresses um if you lose your key or
[36:34] your key is uh just uh you know
[36:37] destroyed in a natural disaster or
[36:39] something then uh the bitcoin's
[36:42] potentially gone there are ways that you
[36:45] can use single Sig you can kind of
[36:48] modify single Sig to address kind of
[36:51] some of those concerns for example
[36:53] someone might think oh well I'm going to
[36:55] make multiple copies of my key spread
[36:58] them around so that if one of them is
[37:00] destroyed or or lost then I still have
[37:03] another copy of my keys somewhere else
[37:05] and I'm okay so you can address things
[37:08] like LW like the the risk of losing your
[37:11] your Bitcoin through that but what
[37:13] you're actually doing is you're
[37:15] increasing the chances of vulnerability
[37:18] to theft because if you got a bunch of
[37:20] copies of your keys all over the place
[37:22] if any one of them is found by a thief
[37:25] then uh the thief can access your
[37:27] Bitcoin so you can you can resolve the
[37:31] risk of loss in a way but but you're
[37:33] opening yourself up to the risk of theft
[37:36] there's also the reverse is also true so
[37:38] you can protect yourself um kind of uh
[37:43] you can protect yourself from theft uh
[37:46] by doing things like uh putting a a bip
[37:50] 39 passphrase on your key um or you know
[37:56] uh kind of Inc in your seed phrase in a
[37:59] way that only you can
[38:01] decode that can help um address the risk
[38:05] of theft but then what you're doing is
[38:08] you are actually opening yourself to
[38:10] increased chance of loss because if you
[38:12] have both your key plus a passphrase on
[38:16] top of it now you've got two different
[38:18] items that either one of them if either
[38:20] one of them is forgotten or lost or
[38:23] something then your Bitcoin is no longer
[38:25] accessible so the traditional methods of
[38:29] trying to improve single Sig are not
[38:33] ideal they're not they're not um
[38:35] sufficient especially for an institution
[38:38] if an institution like a big company or
[38:41] a government wants to be protecting a
[38:44] treasury of Bitcoin single Sig is just
[38:47] it's frankly unacceptable uh you need
[38:50] something that's called threshold
[38:52] security threshold security is the only
[38:55] way to um eliminate kind of both sides
[39:00] of the uh concern Spectrum both theft
[39:04] and loss um and what what I mean when I
[39:07] say a threshold uh a lot of people might
[39:10] be familiar with the idea of of multisig
[39:12] but that's where you could have
[39:13] something like you need any two out of
[39:16] three pieces right if you need any two
[39:18] out of three pieces that means uh in
[39:21] order to access the Bitcoin that means
[39:23] that if a thief gets one item they don't
[39:27] have two right so they they don't have
[39:29] access to the Bitcoin yet um and then uh
[39:33] if any one piece was destroyed or lost
[39:36] you could use the other two remaining
[39:37] pieces to still recover the Bitcoin so
[39:41] multisig um there's actually a few
[39:43] different ways to do threshold security
[39:46] but multisig is kind of the most
[39:47] straightforward it's been around the
[39:49] longest uh it's
[39:51] the um it's the easiest to to to set up
[39:56] um I guess the only the only downside is
[39:59] that it adds a little bit of transaction
[40:01] fees uh to to your transaction so it's a
[40:04] little bit more costly um but it at
[40:07] unchain we feels for most people that
[40:10] are really serious about protecting
[40:11] larger amounts of Bitcoin for the long
[40:14] term multi is the way to go for sure
[40:17] absolutely and I think the future
[40:20] limitations what you teased was also
[40:22] really interesting uh I guess you talk a
[40:24] little bit about utx home management uh
[40:26] and the future limitations of of H how
[40:30] many people institutions companies can
[40:32] actually transact on a base layer uh
[40:35] versus uh how many have to then go a
[40:38] layer above or maybe we can find some
[40:41] solutions uh I guess that's where you're
[40:43] pointing towards yeah exactly so
[40:46] um
[40:48] basically Bitcoin is limited by um
[40:53] certain parameters that are that and
[40:55] there's a very good reason for the
[40:57] parameters right and what I'm referring
[40:59] to is kind of the the block size and
[41:01] also how quick blocks are added to the
[41:04] blockchain so this constrains um how
[41:08] many transactions can be added to the
[41:12] Ledger um Bitcoin made that choice so
[41:16] that it could be more decentralized
[41:18] which is really important um but but the
[41:21] result of that is that uh you've got a
[41:24] lot of people around the world that are
[41:26] trying to move coin around and they're
[41:30] uh they all have to kind of compete with
[41:33] one another
[41:34] for the uh the space available in the
[41:38] blocks that are being added to the
[41:40] blockchain so when they're competing
[41:43] with one another what they're doing is
[41:44] they are trying to outbid each other in
[41:47] terms of transaction
[41:49] fees um so the the kind of the the more
[41:54] uh Satoshi the more Bitcoin that you are
[41:56] paying
[41:58] uh relative to the uh the amount of
[42:01] space that your transaction is using in
[42:03] in the
[42:05] block um the more you're willing to pay
[42:07] the more that the miners are going to
[42:09] want to include your transaction and add
[42:11] it to the blockchain and so you're going
[42:13] to outcompete everyone else um but that
[42:17] kind of means that people that have more
[42:21] Bitcoin have an advantage in that
[42:24] competition uh because you know if you
[42:27] are someone that has 100 Bitcoin and
[42:30] you're trying to move it around you you
[42:31] could be willing to pay uh a sizable fee
[42:36] and it's still a small percentage of the
[42:39] Bitcoin that you're moving whereas if
[42:41] you're just a a kind of a regular person
[42:44] um and you have you know maybe a
[42:45] fraction of a Bitcoin if you want to try
[42:48] to comp compete and get your
[42:50] transaction uh to to be mined into a
[42:54] block um you might have to pay like a
[42:56] much higher
[42:57] percentage of your Bitcoin to do
[43:01] that the math works out um so
[43:05] that uh
[43:08] basically there's a kind of a downside
[43:10] recommend or there's like a a lower
[43:13] limit in terms of the utxos that you
[43:17] want to be holding in your uh in your
[43:21] self- custody wallet there's like a kind
[43:24] of a size minimum that will help protect
[43:27] you um and maybe not everyone is
[43:30] familiar with what a utxo is so maybe I
[43:33] could uh take a minute to clarify that
[43:36] um a utxo is like a chunk of Bitcoin so
[43:40] when you receive Bitcoin in a
[43:43] transaction you're receiving one utxo
[43:46] and it's worth the amount that you are
[43:49] receiving you can kind of think of it
[43:51] like you are receiving a coin that has a
[43:55] denomination of whatever amount you're
[43:58] receiving or or or you could maybe use a
[44:00] dollar bill as an an an analogy excuse
[44:03] me um so it's kind of like you could you
[44:05] can imagine your your wallet's like a
[44:08] piggy bank and as you receive Bitcoin
[44:11] into it you're getting utxos of these
[44:13] different amounts and that fundamentally
[44:16] changes the the nature of your wallet um
[44:21] you uh if
[44:24] someone say someone wants to receive 10
[44:26] bitco coin if they receive 10 Bitcoin
[44:29] all in one transaction they have one
[44:31] utxo that's worth 10 Bitcoin If instead
[44:34] they receive that 10 Bitcoin um maybe
[44:38] across 20 different transactions of half
[44:41] a Bitcoin each then they have 20 utxos
[44:45] instead of one utxo so even though the
[44:47] balance of the wall of those two wallets
[44:48] are the same they have a different
[44:50] number of
[44:51] utxos so hopefully that kind of makes
[44:53] sense in terms of what a utxo is now now
[44:56] why it matters is that the more utxos
[44:59] you have uh the more data your
[45:03] transaction will take up in these blocks
[45:06] so you can think of it like your piggy
[45:08] bank is now heavier if you have a lot of
[45:09] utxo so it's going to be more expensive
[45:12] to uh to transfer your Bitcoin out um so
[45:16] the the person that has just one utxo
[45:20] with all of their Bitcoin uh they are
[45:23] going to much uh it's going to be much
[45:25] easier for them to
[45:27] um to compete in that game of trying to
[45:30] to move their Bitcoin from one place to
[45:32] another and the people that are in a in
[45:34] a danger zone or if someone's just
[45:38] receiving Bitcoin to self-
[45:40] custody once a day in a tiny amount then
[45:43] they're going to be get they're going to
[45:44] be end ending up with dozens or hundreds
[45:46] of utxos that are all really tiny and
[45:50] potentially the fees to move that
[45:52] Bitcoin is uh a very high percentage of
[45:57] what the total Bitcoin balance of the
[45:58] wallet is could in some cases it could
[46:01] be 100% or more in which case uh in
[46:05] which case although you think you have
[46:07] Bitcoin you kind of don't have Bitcoin
[46:09] it's a sort of a a self- rug pull in a
[46:13] way um so I mentioned kind of like a a
[46:18] way to protect yourself from that is
[46:19] kind of paying attention to um not
[46:22] having utxos that are too small there
[46:24] sort of a lower limit
[46:27] recommendation so I've I've written
[46:29] about that and the math behind it it's a
[46:32] bit subjective there's not exactly like
[46:34] a a right answer for everybody because
[46:37] it depends on um what fees you're
[46:41] personally comfortable with potentially
[46:43] paying it also depends on what your kind
[46:47] of future predictions are in terms of
[46:49] the fee rate Market in Bitcoin um but a
[46:53] rule of thumb that a lot of people have
[46:54] been using is that
[46:57] uh you want a million Satoshi as as a as
[47:02] a utxo so uh that would be you know
[47:06] 0.01 Bitcoin if your utxos are larger
[47:11] than that you're you you have a pretty
[47:14] decent level of protection from this
[47:17] issue that I'm
[47:19] describing um and and that
[47:21] recommendation is is actually for kind
[47:23] of a single Sig wallet if you're using a
[47:25] multi-sig wallet you might want to go
[47:27] higher like uh potentially um 2 million
[47:31] Satoshi as as a
[47:33] minimum um but the issue that that we're
[47:37] finally arriving at here that was kind
[47:39] of a big windup there but the issue that
[47:42] we're arriving at is that if there's a
[47:44] recommendation of a million
[47:47] Satoshi every time you receive Bitcoin
[47:49] into self-
[47:51] custody how much does that cost right um
[47:55] with the price of Bitcoin going up
[47:57] that's getting more and more expensive
[47:59] to achieve so you know at 100K
[48:01] Bitcoin a million sents is $1,000 so
[48:06] that means you know uh you don't really
[48:09] want to be buying like $300 worth of
[48:12] bitcoin and then transferring it to
[48:13] self- custody because you have a a
[48:15] smaller utxo than what's recommended um
[48:19] so $300 was acceptable a couple years
[48:23] ago when Bitcoin was $30,000
[48:26] but uh that that minimum utxo size is
[48:29] just getting more and more prohibitive
[48:32] for people that you know don't have a
[48:35] large income to be spending on
[48:37] accumulating Bitcoin and bringing it
[48:38] into self- custody so you could imagine
[48:40] that at a million dollars per Bitcoin
[48:43] then you've
[48:45] got you've got a cost of $10,000 to
[48:48] bring a reasonable sized utxo into self-
[48:52] custody so that's where you uh self-
[48:55] custody really becomes
[48:57] um a challenge for people uh that don't
[49:00] have $10,000 Ling around to buy Bitcoin
[49:03] with uh so they'll
[49:05] need there's a there's several different
[49:08] theories about how to deal with this
[49:11] problem um you know people can still buy
[49:15] Bitcoin and have it held by a custodian
[49:17] but that comes with the disadvantages
[49:19] that we talked
[49:20] about uh other than that there might be
[49:23] some ways to improve
[49:27] um custodianship to make it more trust
[49:29] minimized so there's that kind of the uh
[49:32] the risk is lowered when you're using a
[49:35] custodian um and then there's also some
[49:38] ideas in terms of
[49:40] improving uh Bitcoin
[49:43] scalability um by potentially making
[49:46] some adjustments to how Bitcoin works
[49:48] like a soft Fork so uh yeah I know I
[49:52] just kind of covered a lot there uh I
[49:54] don't know if uh if we want to dive into
[49:56] any part of that more more
[49:58] deeply uh yeah absolutely before I do
[50:01] that I have uh I I usually I I I did we
[50:06] talked about utxo management and about
[50:08] that problem uh I think already like
[50:11] five six seven maybe 10 times on the
[50:13] podcast but one time I took the time to
[50:16] really go deeper and I went deeper with
[50:19] uh Wicket uh most people probably have
[50:22] seen him on on Twitter somewhere uh and
[50:26] uh for people that really want to dive
[50:28] into that what we covered now 10 minutes
[50:30] I think that's that's a great uh kind of
[50:33] starting point where we talked about UD
[50:35] o Management on the side of making sure
[50:41] you can spend your Bitcoin and not
[50:42] paying more fees than your actual
[50:44] Bitcoin but also the Privacy side of
[50:47] things uh in in the utx also like
[50:50] labeling your your your Bitcoin chunks
[50:52] and stuff like that uh and uh if if if
[50:56] you takes always a word like it was for
[50:58] me one and a half years ago that is like
[51:01] what is that why do I need to know about
[51:03] it I hopefully um hopefully you now know
[51:08] uh hopefully Tom gave you know a good
[51:10] idea like why you you have to pay
[51:12] attention to that and this is just like
[51:14] a really in-depth uh uh view view on why
[51:18] and how and and stuff like that which
[51:21] would just completely like we we would
[51:23] need now another hour to cover that to
[51:26] the same stand even though I know Tom
[51:28] could could do that on on a really good
[51:31] level yeah yeah I want to Echo that like
[51:34] if anyone just listened to what I said
[51:36] and it was complete news to them they
[51:37] had no idea that that this was the case
[51:40] definitely go watch that that interview
[51:42] with Wicked um yeah I'm familiar with
[51:44] him from Twitter as well he knows a lot
[51:46] about this issue um and he's always
[51:48] trying to spread education uh as well
[51:51] about this yeah Wick is great I did some
[51:54] spaces with him uh and he just I I
[51:56] didn't hear that much uh Lately from him
[52:00] have to check it check up if he's still
[52:02] active and everything uh but yeah that
[52:04] that's a great thing uh to do um we
[52:07] already at at almost one hour is there
[52:09] is there anything uh that we might have
[52:11] missed in self custody anything that
[52:13] you're like oh that's that's really
[52:15] important also uh to to know except the
[52:18] that people should really pay attention
[52:21] to
[52:22] that yeah uh well gee I could I could
[52:25] talk for yourself about self- custody
[52:27] for for hours there's it's endless of
[52:29] what you could know um but I do think
[52:33] that those are some of the most
[52:35] important things really what people are
[52:37] concerned about is not losing their
[52:40] Bitcoin um and uh you know one angle is
[52:45] protecting the key material we we
[52:47] covered that um but then yeah I think
[52:49] really the other one that people need to
[52:51] be thinking about is utxo management it
[52:55] was more of an optional
[52:57] um Endeavor uh when it when the Bitcoin
[53:00] price was lower like I talked about you
[53:02] could get away with buying $30 of
[53:04] Bitcoin and moving it into self- custody
[53:06] and and you didn't have to be thinking
[53:07] about this but as we move forward and
[53:10] really even today right now with the way
[53:13] that uh the Bitcoin price is people
[53:15] absolutely need to be learning about
[53:17] this um it is uh it is mandatory if you
[53:20] want to ensure that uh you can use the
[53:24] purchasing power of your Bitcoin down
[53:26] the road
[53:27] H really cool I have one question that I
[53:29] asked each and every one of my guests
[53:31] and this is the question of what can we
[53:33] learn from you besides Bitcoin what can
[53:36] okay uh man that's a I've been so
[53:40] focused on bitcoin for for like the uh
[53:43] the past few years that uh that's almost
[53:46] a tough question to to answer but I
[53:50] would say like I I'm I've been finding
[53:52] myself getting really interested in kind
[53:55] of Bitcoin adjacent things which uh
[53:58] which a lot of people involved with
[54:00] Bitcoin uh can relate to that so you
[54:04] know I've been kind of in my spare time
[54:06] and looking a bit more at like Austrian
[54:09] economics and kind of the uh the
[54:13] theories uh behind monetary competition
[54:17] and stuff and and I know that's uh
[54:19] that's maybe a a cheat answer because
[54:23] it's still so so close to bitcoin but uh
[54:27] but it does it does go past the scope of
[54:30] of just Bitcoin and um I think a lot of
[54:33] people
[54:34] are are using kind of Bitcoin as an
[54:39] Avenue to find these ideas about kind of
[54:43] the the truth in terms of how the world
[54:46] works like Austrian economics has been
[54:48] pretty Niche um across the world it's
[54:51] been sort of a small group relatively
[54:54] that is uh that is been interested in it
[54:57] historically but uh you know you've got
[55:01] uh I forget his name but you've got like
[55:03] uh that MMA fighter who's like now after
[55:06] he wins a fight he's like read Ludwig
[55:08] von mises and stuff um and he's into
[55:11] Bitcoin and everything and so I think
[55:13] it's Bitcoin is sort of an Avenue for
[55:15] these ideas to become more mainstream
[55:18] and taken seriously if that occurs it
[55:22] can really change how uh the leadership
[55:24] of the world uh um approaches things um
[55:28] potentially in a positive way that can
[55:30] really uh really change a lot for the
[55:33] better i s I found the clip instantly
[55:37] but they're not telling us the names
[55:39] from him Brazilian UFC fight the victory
[55:43] speech pumps austan economics if you
[55:45] care about your country read Ludwick F
[55:48] mes and the six lessons of the austan
[55:50] economic schools nice yeah yeah um I I
[55:55] think that
[55:58] I came up with the idea that I think
[56:00] that it should be a requirement that
[56:01] every time someone wins a fight they
[56:04] have to recommend a book and that way we
[56:06] get uh we get our our Fighters and our
[56:09] book readers um uh to uh on the same
[56:13] page both uh in terms of physical
[56:15] strength and mental
[56:17] strength that that's very true perfect
[56:20] and yeah thank you so much uh already
[56:22] for that we have end routine in the
[56:24] podcast where the previous guest is
[56:25] asking a question for the next guest uh
[56:27] without knowing who the next guest is
[56:29] and the question is from the previous
[56:31] guest will Bitcoin have to achieve
[56:33] Global Currency status to call it a
[56:36] success oo
[56:38] um so that's that's a great question
[56:41] I've been thinking a lot about actually
[56:43] I I think it would kind of depend on how
[56:45] someone is defining currency um because
[56:48] there are maybe some uh some slight
[56:51] differences when someone's using the
[56:53] word money versus currency
[56:56] um my view is that uh this the sign of
[57:01] Bitcoin success is really when it takes
[57:04] over um the the savings of the world
[57:09] right so the uh kind of long-term
[57:13] capital storage um now in terms of does
[57:19] it need to like be
[57:21] used directly as an everyday currency by
[57:25] Regular People for um for buying small
[57:29] things I'm not sure about that uh I
[57:33] think I think that would be nice that
[57:35] would be ideal but some of the stuff we
[57:37] covered earlier in this podcast
[57:39] regarding utxos and stuff um it does
[57:43] make that Vision um questionable um and
[57:47] you know the lightning Network certainly
[57:49] helps it it doesn't really reach the uh
[57:54] kind of global scalability that we would
[57:56] need uh for just everyone to be using it
[58:00] for transactions at least um outside of
[58:04] uh using kind of custodial Services uh
[58:10] but yeah so I I guess my answer if we're
[58:13] thinking about currency in terms of just
[58:16] like what the money that everybody uses
[58:18] dayto day I guess my answer would be no
[58:21] uh that um that Bitcoin could still be a
[58:25] success and make the World a much better
[58:27] place without that result although uh it
[58:31] would be very nice to have that result
[58:33] as well if we figure out how to do it
[58:35] properly I I agree with that and yeah
[58:37] there's a lot of a lot of work still to
[58:40] to be done in in in Bitcoin and that's
[58:43] something I'm really also uh I'm I'm
[58:45] trying to push as much as possible here
[58:47] in the Bitcoin space thank you so much
[58:49] uh Tom already for being on before I let
[58:52] you go where can people find you ask
[58:53] your questions reach out to you yeah so
[58:56] I am on Twitter um I get my handle is
[59:01] _ hanic which is my last name h n z i k
[59:07] um that's I that's pretty much the only
[59:10] social media place I am um but uh people
[59:15] are welcome to to send me uh direct
[59:17] messages with with questions related to
[59:19] this stuff I can definitely Point people
[59:21] towards more information that either
[59:23] I've written about or just other good
[59:25] resources that I'm aware of and then if
[59:27] anyone's interested in in Unchained
[59:30] particularly um any American listeners
[59:34] uh then you know unchain dcom is the the
[59:37] place to learn more uh and definitely
[59:40] you might find yourself uh working with
[59:42] me uh and and we can get you uh you know
[59:47] with set up with multisig and and
[59:50] potentially um like buying buying and
[59:53] selling Bitcoin we have a trade desk we
[59:55] offer the ability for people in America
[59:58] to hold their own keys to Bitcoin in a
[60:00] retirement account which is one of the
[60:02] more Unique Products as well um and uh
[60:06] we have stuff related to inheritance Etc
[60:08] so if if any listeners are interested in
[60:11] any of that and and are in America you
[60:13] know please reach
[60:14] out I'm I'm Envy of America uh I cannot
[60:18] even hold Bitcoin in a retirement
[60:20] account not even without my
[60:22] keys that's just not possible I would
[60:26] love to have that possibility uh but
[60:28] unfortunately I'm not in America maybe
[60:30] that changes in the future I don't know
