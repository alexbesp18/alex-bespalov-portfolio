[00:00] people put very little thought into how
[00:02] money actually works not invest more
[00:05] than you can afford to lose because it's
[00:07] one thing to understand what an
[00:09] important revolutionary technology it is
[00:11] but it's another thing entirely that a
[00:14] significant number of other people in
[00:15] the world will come around to that same
[00:18] realization money only works as and will
[00:21] gain value and traction if other people
[00:24] also sharing the idea we would be
[00:26] talking about hundreds or even thousands
[00:28] of times the purchasing power that put
[00:30] in then so you know that's way better
[00:31] than any other bet that you could have
[00:33] made I mean I think that Bitcoin has
[00:35] been the best if you just look at it
[00:37] purely as a bet it has been the better
[00:39] bet for on just on that basis of
[00:42] anything that you could possibly have
[00:43] had your money in Money is just a ledger
[00:45] for who owes what to whom and so if um
[00:48] Bitcoin is just a far more trustworthy
[00:50] way of storing that information than
[00:52] centralized systems that people behind
[00:54] those systems can change the rules of
[00:56] and create more tokens uh for themselves
[01:00] [Music]
[01:04] let's start with with with the media
[01:06] because I think that's really uh
[01:07] interesting what what you're what you're
[01:09] doing there because like so early and
[01:11] Bitcoin only focus it it's really hard
[01:13] but I see a lot of Bitcoin ogs that
[01:16] always had like those those times where
[01:18] they went to crypto and went to other
[01:21] other things uh for sometimes like even
[01:24] like longer like years uh till they then
[01:27] came back to to bitcoin only and now
[01:30] it's more and more of like bitcoiners
[01:32] that come in now get the Bitcoin only
[01:33] content more and more and maybe just let
[01:37] I I leave that in as a cold start now
[01:39] but how was it for you to uh get started
[01:41] in in in Bitcoin so early in 2013 and
[01:44] start the the meetups and and how it
[01:46] developed from there sure well okay
[01:48] first of all when I first heard about
[01:52] Bitcoin it was
[01:53] obviously as it is with everybody a fair
[01:56] way before I actually took any kind of
[01:58] action at all I think we all have those
[02:00] multiple touch points we have to sort of
[02:02] hear about it and the first instinct is
[02:04] to think that doesn't make any sense it
[02:06] seems like some sort of scam um how
[02:08] could someone just create a token out of
[02:10] thin air and expect people to pay real
[02:12] money for it uh these sorts of things we
[02:15] still hear them to this day um for me
[02:18] there was those sorts of very early 2013
[02:21] and perhaps even early in fact I do
[02:23] remember even hearing about the concept
[02:25] of using proof of work as a means of uh
[02:28] limiting email span back in the very
[02:29] early 2000s but I don't quite count that
[02:32] as Bitcoin but it is of course a very
[02:34] important part of Bitcoin the proof of
[02:36] work Adam back's proof of work and what
[02:38] ended up making Bitcoin possible but it
[02:40] wasn't until the sort of late 2013 run
[02:44] was a very large bull run then where it
[02:47] seemed where I started to actually okay
[02:49] I'm hearing about it for a second time
[02:51] there there must be more to this why is
[02:52] it running again and then started to
[02:55] actually do the work it needed to you
[02:57] know it's very easy to have an opinion
[02:59] it's much harder to actually have the
[03:01] knowledge behind that opinion and so
[03:03] okay better actually look more closely
[03:05] at what's going on here and actually and
[03:07] then of course after only having read a
[03:10] few things about the fact that mainly
[03:12] because it was
[03:13] decentralized um and the way in which it
[03:15] achieves consensus without a center in
[03:18] without a central Authority and the very
[03:20] very elegant and clever way that it did
[03:22] that that the penny kind of dropped and
[03:24] then of course you know you go down the
[03:26] rabbit hole and want to find out more
[03:27] and more and more and more and more and
[03:28] of course the vious implication of that
[03:31] and is well this has got to be worth
[03:34] more than you know at the time you know
[03:36] 6 s or $800 that it was going up to at
[03:38] that
[03:39] point and so yeah you want to get some
[03:42] sort of financial exposure to that that
[03:44] is the first step I think a lot of
[03:46] people motivates a lot of people to get
[03:48] into it is not uh so much saving the
[03:50] world or uh you
[03:55] know saving the world from the tyranny
[03:57] of fractional Reserve Banking and all of
[03:59] these other sorts of things but the idea
[04:01] that hey look if I put some money into
[04:03] this that is going to have that's going
[04:06] to be worth a lot more money later on um
[04:09] but of course that's a very a very naive
[04:11] thing of course we we now realize that
[04:14] that this is the money and to the extent
[04:16] that we were a to take something off the
[04:19] table it would only be for the purposes
[04:20] of spending it on something we need and
[04:22] we're never going back to Fiat so in
[04:24] those early days that was essentially
[04:27] only Bitcoin there there were some vest
[04:30] es of what we now call crypto but but it
[04:33] it had no it was not really meaningful
[04:37] at all I think there was something
[04:38] Litecoin was about all of their Wars and
[04:41] to the extent that there was any kind of
[04:44] um Social Scene or networking scene for
[04:48] the Bitcoin industry uh there were some
[04:51] Bitcoin meetups again they don't they
[04:53] weren't calling them blockchain meetups
[04:55] or crypto meetups it was just Bitcoin
[04:57] meetups and these
[05:00] generally drinks types events social
[05:03] events people would just meet and talk
[05:04] there were no there was no structure to
[05:06] it uh you know speakers and special
[05:09] guests and things like the sorts of
[05:11] things we have now and of course it
[05:14] should also be remembered that one of
[05:15] the reasons why perhaps there weren't
[05:17] speakers and special guests and all and
[05:20] all of that that we can have now at the
[05:21] events that Bitcoin is around the whole
[05:23] world run is that there were very few
[05:26] people out there actually talking about
[05:27] Bitcoin there were very few Bitcoin
[05:29] Educators um standout names from the
[05:33] time I think to for whom to whom so many
[05:36] owe a great debt as guys like Andreas
[05:39] Antonopoulos and dare I say um Trace
[05:42] Mayer even I know that he became
[05:44] controversial for an incident at a
[05:47] particular at a um at a Bitcoin
[05:49] conference a few years ago I think but
[05:52] that he has still for many people he
[05:54] earned tremendous Goodwill in the work
[05:56] that he did in making people understand
[05:59] the truly the truly profound
[06:01] implications of uh of this technology
[06:04] and uh revolution in money um so that's
[06:08] that's what it was like in the very
[06:09] early days there it wasn't until of
[06:11] course later on that we can and we can
[06:13] talk about this further into the
[06:15] discussion that things started to to
[06:18] change just crypto and blockchain and so
[06:20] forth it's super interesting for me like
[06:23] how this all altcoin scene uh came on
[06:25] and and how it developed but it's also
[06:28] interesting to discuss okay what is real
[06:31] money like because people feel their
[06:34] fear currencies is the only money there
[06:36] is like they they see it that as their
[06:38] their money and then you get into
[06:40] Bitcoin you want to get more money but
[06:43] in in the transition phase of like
[06:46] getting more money you actually discover
[06:48] money which is a magical thing that
[06:51] happens for me this was an a very
[06:53] important part in fact of me essentially
[06:56] realizing the importance of Bitcoin
[06:59] relative quickly after I like many
[07:01] people still struggle to they've known
[07:03] about it for 10 years but they still
[07:04] struggle to understand the implications
[07:07] of it and still don't take any action
[07:08] whereas after I'd gotten a relatively
[07:11] small amount of information on it that
[07:14] was enough for me to go you know holy
[07:16] crap this is like this is a big deal
[07:18] this is a real thing that is worth uh
[07:21] putting not just you know a lot of time
[07:25] into understanding but my S some of my
[07:28] savings I should point out that just
[07:30] because I hasten to add at this point
[07:32] that just because someone is to what
[07:35] many people coming in now think is a
[07:37] relatively early adopter that such
[07:40] people are doing are going into Bitcoin
[07:43] in the way people do now in this sailor
[07:45] likee manner where uh that you're not
[07:47] only encouraged to put everything you've
[07:49] got into Bitcoin but you know sell your
[07:51] house sell your wife mortgage everything
[07:53] to the hilt and uh and actually borrow
[07:55] money to buy Bitcoin the the prevailing
[07:57] narrative back in those days and this
[07:59] was even from the most Ardent Bitcoin uh
[08:03] bulls or the most you know um committed
[08:06] Bitcoin Enthusiast was to not invest
[08:09] more than you can afford to lose because
[08:10] it's one thing to understand what an
[08:13] important revolutionary technology it is
[08:16] and and evolution in in in once in the
[08:19] Millennium evolution in money that it is
[08:22] but it's another thing entirely that a
[08:25] significant number of other people in
[08:26] the world will come around to that same
[08:29] realization because it's not they have
[08:31] to other money only works as and will
[08:35] gain value and traction if other people
[08:38] also shareing the sharing the idea so
[08:41] there was no guarantee of that back then
[08:43] and of course there was a very brutal
[08:45] bare Market um that occurred uh straight
[08:50] after 2013 which went for many several
[08:53] years and wasn't until people that
[08:55] really did get in at that ear relatively
[08:57] early Point um started to sort of see
[09:00] the fruits of their conviction um resul
[09:04] in you know now rapidly appreciating
[09:07] purchasing power for the money that
[09:08] they've now transitioned
[09:11] into at what point I mean I guess you
[09:15] have now such a strong conviction in
[09:17] Bitcoin that you're like okay it's it is
[09:19] is beyond the point of no return I I
[09:22] assume now I believe so yeah I think I
[09:26] believe so now I mean back as I said
[09:28] back in those early days perhaps prior
[09:31] to sort of
[09:32] 2017 it wasn't a guarantee as I said
[09:35] even the most Ardent Bitcoin uh
[09:37] proponents said don't invest more than
[09:39] you could lose it's considered to be
[09:40] sort of you know there's some not maybe
[09:45] a few chances in 10 or something of it
[09:46] if it you know progressing to where it
[09:49] is now but if it but it was always what
[09:51] was always important though was it was
[09:53] an asymmetric bet in that okay um if
[09:58] this comes to nothing and the rest of
[10:00] the world never gets it and it just
[10:01] dribbles off and becomes a no one ever
[10:04] cares about it again well you can only
[10:06] lose 100% of the money that you put in
[10:09] but what you get back though if this
[10:11] does come good and I believed at the
[10:13] time that there were a significant
[10:14] number of chances in 10 that it would
[10:16] not like you know we're talking maybe it
[10:18] was two or three in 10 then that would
[10:23] that would result in you getting
[10:25] hundreds or perhaps even thousands of
[10:27] times and when I say get money back when
[10:29] not talking about like people are quick
[10:30] to jump on that and say oh you sort of
[10:32] only wanting it to get more fat no we
[10:35] talk about it because in terms of
[10:37] increased purchasing power I mean the
[10:39] whole purpose of money is not just a
[10:41] hoarded I mean money is a means to an
[10:44] end and one of the ends of money is to
[10:46] be able to spend it on goods and
[10:47] services that we need and so in that
[10:50] respect you want to hold the money that
[10:52] is likely to have to likely to yield you
[10:54] in at some Future Point the greatest
[10:56] ability to purchase goods and services
[10:58] with it so uh
[10:59] um so that whatever you however much uh
[11:03] purchasing power the Fiat that you put
[11:05] in had you want that to be much as much
[11:09] much greater in future years and so if
[11:11] that were to be the case if Bitcoin was
[11:13] to have um prevailed then um we would be
[11:16] talking about hundreds or even thousands
[11:19] of times the purchasing power that you'd
[11:21] put in then so um you know that's way
[11:23] better than like any other bet that you
[11:26] could have made I mean I think that
[11:27] Bitcoin has been the best
[11:30] if you just look at it purely as a bet
[11:32] it has been the better bet for on just
[11:35] on that basis of anything that you could
[11:38] possibly have had your money in for the
[11:40] last um well the entirety of bitcoin's
[11:42] existence the last 15 years and uh and
[11:46] even now even though the you know the uh
[11:49] the rate in purchasing power
[11:51] appreciation has has dropped somewhat it
[11:54] slowed down at least in at least up to
[11:57] the present Point uh even even then the
[12:00] the the risk reward ratio and the return
[12:02] has been better than any other thing
[12:04] that you could have that most people
[12:06] would have put their money on I'm not
[12:07] say like of course people could fluke in
[12:09] a particular stock trade or something
[12:12] like that or or win the lottery um but
[12:14] as a risk reward you know um ratio uh
[12:18] Bitcoin and still is um the best place
[12:21] to have your money it's very hard to
[12:23] really do anything else when you know
[12:25] everything else you do potentially um
[12:28] has to get over that hurdle rate of what
[12:31] uh of what bitcoin's giving you even now
[12:34] it's yeah it's hard to decide on like on
[12:36] on what to invest in outside of Bitcoin
[12:40] but what uh what I'm really curious
[12:42] because you have been on the point of
[12:44] like Bitcoin was not at uh over the
[12:47] point of no return and now it it seems
[12:50] to be over that point at what point in
[12:52] history do you think we cross that of of
[12:55] like the risk reward is now so good uh
[12:58] because the risk just was lower to a
[13:01] point of like we we have to imagine
[13:03] alien civilizations coming to us and
[13:05] like really crazy situation that we can
[13:08] even think about Bitcoin getting uh
[13:11] dissolved uh and in in the early days
[13:14] was quite easy like maybe the government
[13:16] P bans it or like it was an instable and
[13:19] unproven network that just still had to
[13:21] go through that at what point did we go
[13:23] over that point of no return yeah what
[13:25] you're describing there is what's known
[13:27] as the Lindy effect so the longer
[13:28] something exists for the less likely it
[13:31] is not to exist at at some future point
[13:34] it's kind of the opposite I mean usually
[13:36] the older something gets the more
[13:37] decrepit it gets and falls apart and
[13:39] dies you know we're all going to do that
[13:42] um but the Lindy effect describes things
[13:44] that uh that prove themselves the longer
[13:47] they're around and therefore are more
[13:48] likely to keep existing and bitcoin's a
[13:50] great example of that now as for the
[13:52] point at which that happened I don't
[13:54] think it could say there a sudden point
[13:56] but what I would argue to your question
[13:59] that you mentioned the risk reward
[14:01] ratio I think it's always actually been
[14:04] the same now here's the thing remember
[14:07] that okay we've had since you know early
[14:10] since the bottoms of the 2014 bare
[14:13] Market where pretty much everyone
[14:14] thought it was dead not going anywhere
[14:16] it was bottomed out at around
[14:18] $200 um Bitcoin is now worth 500 times
[14:22] more but I would argue now though okay
[14:26] now I don't think you're going to get
[14:27] like 500 X in that same period again
[14:31] it'll be the next stage will be be
[14:33] slower
[14:34] but the risk is also much lower that's
[14:38] the thing so the ratio Remains the Same
[14:40] but the risk is now much lower so yeah
[14:42] whilst you're not going to get a if you
[14:44] put you know let's say you know $220,000
[14:48] in now um that is not going to
[14:52] necessarily go 500 times but you stand
[14:54] you stand a lot less chance of losing
[14:56] that $20,000 moreover you could be much
[14:58] more comfortable putting in a much
[15:00] greater percentage of your net worth
[15:01] than what people felt comfortable doing
[15:03] back then like I said that the figures
[15:05] that was generally bandied about back
[15:07] then was you know maybe 10% of you know
[15:12] of your savings that's not 10% even if
[15:14] your net worth like your house and your
[15:16] car and everything it's 10% of your
[15:17] savings more like a flutter you know um
[15:20] now of course you can much more safely
[15:23] put a great much greater percentage in
[15:25] you don't quite need to get doesn't need
[15:26] to be a you don't need to get a 500x
[15:29] return for it to be worthwhile it could
[15:31] be uh it could be a 10x and you on on
[15:35] something now that is to to more closely
[15:38] answer your question is far less likely
[15:41] to disappear it's
[15:43] virtually we'll get temporary dips
[15:46] perhaps in the price but the idea that
[15:49] it's disappearing no I mean it's so
[15:51] entrenched now in so many areas the last
[15:54] vest the last time we heard that there
[15:55] was any great risk that that governments
[15:57] would ban it even though even if
[16:00] governments did ban it that I never
[16:02] really considered a strong risk anyway
[16:04] simply because it would have to be a
[16:05] coordinated um exercise where all
[16:08] governments around the world would have
[16:09] to ban it otherwise the governments that
[16:12] do will find themselves or their people
[16:14] and their country at a competitive
[16:15] disadvantage to those countries that
[16:17] don't so there was always the game
[16:19] theory surrounding that making it
[16:20] unlikely for the outset but even if we
[16:22] accept the premise okay if governments
[16:24] ban Bitcoin well um again it wouldn't be
[16:28] all of them it would only be some of
[16:29] them and it would again be just a
[16:30] temporary thing it's not going to kill
[16:32] Bitcoin Bitcoin is what they call
[16:35] antifragile and it's proven its anti
[16:37] fragility that's the other benefit
[16:39] people have getting in now as it might
[16:40] have gotten 10 that they didn't have 10
[16:42] years ago it didn't have so many
[16:45] different ways in which it's proven its
[16:47] anti fragility we hadn't for example yet
[16:51] had the Hostile takeover attempt that uh
[16:55] that was what we now call the or what we
[16:58] even called it time the blocksize war it
[17:01] hadn't ever fa Bitcoin hadn't faced a
[17:03] threat like that before this idea that
[17:05] that a particular group of people with
[17:07] corporate and minor backing could decide
[17:09] that they're going to change the rules
[17:11] of the network and make that be Bitcoin
[17:15] and those that um resisted it somehow
[17:18] end off you know on the wrong side of a
[17:20] chain that that goes nowhere no it it it
[17:23] faced that threat down and and and
[17:26] prevailed with flying colors to the
[17:27] extent that they attempt to take it over
[17:30] is now worth like a couple of parts in a
[17:33] thousand of what Bitcoin is even though
[17:35] at one point it was like it got to 20 or
[17:37] 30% of Bitcoin uh so it faced down that
[17:40] threat and it's faced down uh numerous
[17:44] threats of how many times did China ban
[17:47] Bitcoin and you know until until it just
[17:50] stopped having any real effect on the
[17:52] price people eventually after I think
[17:54] gez it took long enough it took like 10
[17:55] or 15 times before people finally got
[17:57] the idea that can you stop dumping the
[18:00] price every time China decides to ban
[18:02] Bitcoin because it's not it's not it's
[18:05] not going to kill Bitcoin but of course
[18:08] and of course funnily enough China
[18:09] stopped banning at the moment it stopped
[18:11] having any real effect on the market and
[18:13] now you've got to the point where the uh
[18:16] the world's last remaining superpower
[18:19] and the administration in place is is
[18:21] now countenancing or indeed his promised
[18:23] to do to set up have a strategic Bitcoin
[18:26] Reserve um the idea that governments are
[18:29] now buying Bitcoin rather than doing
[18:31] anything to ban it again the game theory
[18:33] always lined up with if Bitcoin is good
[18:37] for individuals in terms of being able
[18:39] to preserve their uh their wealth and
[18:41] their purchasing power and uh and and
[18:44] prevent their money from being
[18:46] interfered with well that's actually
[18:48] also true for corporate entities and
[18:51] governments as well and um and we're
[18:53] seeing that play out so so that's pretty
[18:56] much off the table now the idea that s
[18:58] of I mean if the world's largest
[19:00] superpower isn't going to do it what
[19:02] possible harm is some OT little
[19:06] dictatorship that decides to do it at
[19:08] some Future Point going to have nothing
[19:10] um and I'm sure there are a number of
[19:12] other threats that I could if we if they
[19:15] come up in the conversation over the
[19:16] last 10 years that will have also again
[19:19] proven that if those things didn't knock
[19:22] out Bitcoin then they they're not going
[19:24] to knock it out in the future it's a
[19:25] it's a$2 trillion doll asset now with
[19:29] the biggest uh asset managers in the
[19:33] world integrating it uh into their
[19:36] clients portfolios um the most powerful
[19:39] people some of the most powerful people
[19:40] in the world are now uh in favor of it
[19:43] who are not have no have no interests
[19:45] their interests in no way are aligned
[19:48] with trying to suppress or destroy
[19:50] Bitcoin that's that's really good
[19:51] explain because like you have the cost
[19:53] of attacking it uh getting higher and
[19:56] higher with every day and you always
[19:58] have to think of like what is the
[20:00] potential reward for that let's let's
[20:02] assume China actually spends almost all
[20:05] of their resources to attack Bitcoin uh
[20:08] and let's say even if they are
[20:10] successful which they wouldn't be but if
[20:12] they are successful what would they gain
[20:14] they they wouldn't gain anything because
[20:17] most likely and they know that it's just
[20:19] a matter of time till the next Bitcoin
[20:21] comes along and someone tries it and at
[20:23] some point a sound money idea in the
[20:26] digital age will prevail like ideas will
[20:29] not go away and so you have almost no
[20:32] reward for killing Bitcoin but such a
[20:35] high cost that you have to stop
[20:37] everything what you're doing and the
[20:40] incentive to just uh quietly stack
[20:43] Bitcoin yourself and just don't allow it
[20:47] your citizens to buy it and make it
[20:49] really hard for them to buy it um is way
[20:52] bigger and way better to do and this
[20:54] makes also Bitcoin weirdly enough
[20:56] stronger it does it dat and that's
[20:58] that's that has actually been the game
[20:59] theory from day one I mean even though
[21:01] now we're seeing we've seen that play
[21:03] out from day one that was always the
[21:05] game theory and yet uh even now people
[21:09] are still sort of give you that kind of
[21:11] thing oh what if Government bans Bitcoin
[21:13] um so this was never never really a risk
[21:16] but what we do have the benefit of now
[21:17] of seeing is we've proven by in in
[21:21] action the game theory playing out in
[21:23] that way I will just take up one other
[21:24] little point you made there about well
[21:26] if they well first of all I'll say that
[21:29] yeah the other thing as well is and if
[21:30] they were even going to try to crush it
[21:33] in the way you suggested it was far
[21:36] easier to crush if it if it were ever
[21:38] possible it would have been far easier
[21:40] to crush Bitcoin in its crib than it is
[21:44] now as a$2 trillion asset with the
[21:46] backing of some of the most powerful uh
[21:48] politicians um and business people in in
[21:52] institutions in the world um another
[21:55] little point you did make there though
[21:56] well if they did Crush Bitcoin then
[21:59] another one would come along I'm not so
[22:01] sure that would work because I've I'm of
[22:04] the view and this has been the what has
[22:07] been described as the the maximalist
[22:09] Bitcoin maximalist Fe for quite some
[22:10] time that it is this was always a
[22:13] Bitcoin or nothing proposition um
[22:16] because after all if you look at
[22:17] fundamentally what Bitcoin is it is the
[22:20] invention of digital
[22:22] scarcity and that is an essential
[22:25] component of money you could never do
[22:27] scarcity before
[22:29] except if you had physical things and
[22:31] gold became obviously the most obvious
[22:33] example of a thing that was scarce and
[22:35] you required a great deal of proof of
[22:37] work in order to extract from the earth
[22:40] um and that made it and agreed upon that
[22:43] made it a sort of a shelling Point upon
[22:45] which uh people could agree uh to
[22:48] ascribe value to it Bitcoin does that
[22:52] now without the cumbersome physicality
[22:54] of gold but that wasn't something that
[22:56] even anyone thought possible up until
[22:58] Bitcoin was actually invented it was
[22:59] considered to be an impos like the
[23:02] problem Satoshi solved was considered to
[23:04] be an intractable problem and even when
[23:06] he announced that he'd come up with this
[23:08] system on the early Cipher Punk mailing
[23:10] boards mailing list uh many PE most
[23:13] people didn't believe him that he that
[23:14] he had solved it and so fortunately he
[23:16] said look you don't have to believe me
[23:18] here's the code run yourself and we know
[23:20] the story of halny being the first
[23:22] follower who ran that and then people
[23:24] after that started uh running the code
[23:26] now the reason why your point there
[23:29] about another Bitcoin coming along later
[23:30] on is that would never that would never
[23:34] work because once if Bitcoin could be
[23:37] destroyed that way or surpassed by
[23:40] another another coin or another another
[23:43] s another a uh token system based on the
[23:47] same principles then you wouldn't have
[23:49] digital scarcity anymore because
[23:50] although there is a limit of 21 million
[23:53] Bitcoin or 2.1 quadrillion subunits if
[23:57] you choose to think about it in terms of
[23:59] SATs um there's nothing to stop somebody
[24:02] from copying the Bitcoin algorithm the
[24:04] idea and you know spinning off some
[24:08] several million shitcoins which is what
[24:10] we've got but there's a very good reason
[24:12] why none of those shitcoins are going to
[24:14] ever come and touch Bitcoin is because
[24:16] you'll never get anybody to agree on any
[24:18] of those others to be the preeminent
[24:20] store of wealth they'll be highly
[24:21] speculative they'll go up when they're
[24:23] introduced and completely run pull back
[24:26] down um because they are not scared
[24:29] only the thing that was the actual
[24:31] invention of digital scarcity as it was
[24:33] immaculately conceived can be scarce but
[24:36] there could be an infinite number of
[24:37] copies and so if there were if Bitcoin
[24:40] was suppressed or destroyed somehow
[24:43] someone else coming along with another
[24:44] coin I don't think would get any better
[24:47] traction because uh everyone would just
[24:50] believe that the same thing could happen
[24:51] again
[24:53] um
[24:55] so there anyway yeah there there are
[24:59] like a lot of interesting Concepts in
[25:01] there because like like if we like I
[25:05] I've totally agree with like if if
[25:06] Bitcoin doesn't work all the other
[25:08] cryptos that are currently there will
[25:09] also not work um but if we play that for
[25:12] experiment with by the way I I I think
[25:15] Bitcoin will work and I think there
[25:18] there's no other way than Bitcoin but if
[25:20] you just play that thought of like what
[25:21] happens if all of Bitcoin and also all
[25:25] of shitcoin is going to zero and
[25:27] actually is dying out because of I don't
[25:29] know some weird reason I I I cannot even
[25:32] come up with a reason why it should
[25:33] happen uh which speaks a lot to bitcoin
[25:36] but if that happens uh it it probably
[25:40] needs a whole generation to die out till
[25:44] such a new thing can even start to be
[25:48] Begin Again to to goow in in in in
[25:50] things I don't know like but I mean
[25:52] think people see this is often the line
[25:55] you get some people there are certain
[25:57] people in the world who um it's like no
[26:00] matter how remote the risk is they won't
[26:02] take action because they're always
[26:03] trying to think of well what if this
[26:04] happens what if there's like you know a
[26:06] meteor strikes the Earth and this sort
[26:08] of thing um okay all right we can accept
[26:12] for this like as a hypothetical um the
[26:14] idea that um okay if Bitcoin somehow
[26:17] disappears and goes through we could
[26:18] accept that as a hypothetical but is
[26:19] there a meaningful chance that that
[26:22] could occur I mean we have to we can
[26:24] think of all sorts of hypotheticals but
[26:26] if it's not a reasonable um conceivable
[26:30] likelihood of of it of it working out
[26:33] I'm really not sure that it's worth
[26:34] considering you know I mean I mean could
[26:37] say what if uh you know I don't know
[26:39] aliens beam down from space with far
[26:42] superior computers than we've got and
[26:44] perform a 51% attack and then you know
[26:46] that could happen yeah maybe there's a
[26:48] aliens visit Earth with computers that
[26:50] are hundreds of years Advanced from our
[26:52] and 51% of attack Bitcoin okay it's not
[26:55] impossible necessarily but is it is it a
[26:57] meaningful chance
[26:58] um doubt it and so I think we should um
[27:03] therefore you know I don't think things
[27:06] like hypotheticals particularly even
[27:08] unknown hypotheticals should really be
[27:09] like used as a basis of for for for
[27:12] inaction but on the same time I'm also
[27:15] conscious and wary of the idea that we
[27:17] should always consider threats to
[27:19] bitcoin but um and I think one of the
[27:23] things I've kind of noticed in the
[27:26] last um couple of years is that some
[27:30] people are almost getting a little too
[27:32] fanatical you know it's almost getting a
[27:33] little bit in some case I don't want to
[27:35] pointing around but could be a little
[27:37] bit get a little bit cultish sometimes
[27:38] you know and and and for example you
[27:41] know when it comes to the price there's
[27:43] a lot of people who very fervently
[27:45] believe that we can you know we're going
[27:47] to a million dollars you know or or or
[27:50] some crazy price like that we're going
[27:53] to get hyperbitcoinization very very
[27:55] soon and um hyperbitcoinization
[27:58] in case your listeners haven't heard
[28:00] that term before is the idea that um
[28:03] it's kind of a play on the word
[28:04] hyperinflation but instead of
[28:06] hyperinflation Bitcoin is extremely
[28:10] rapidly adopted and and Fiat rapidly
[28:13] loses value in almost like a cataclysmic
[28:15] type event whereby Bitcoin essentially
[28:18] ABS absorbs all of the world's value and
[28:21] the value held in Fiat and Fiat like
[28:24] instruments drops to almost zero that's
[28:26] the sort of hyp hyper Bitcoin as ation
[28:28] scenario and um again I I say this not
[28:32] to be demoralizing on the contrary I'm
[28:35] very very positive towards the future of
[28:37] Bitcoin but I say it for people not to
[28:40] have undue expectations don't start
[28:43] planning your retirement too early
[28:45] thinking that if you've bought yourself
[28:46] if you've got one or two Bitcoin uh or
[28:49] whatever it is that you'll be retiring
[28:53] you know this cycle or even next cycle
[28:55] right when I say cycle I mean like you
[28:57] know what we've come to find to be you
[29:00] know that kind of four-year um you know
[29:03] bull market bare Market type cycle um so
[29:06] don't be surprised if this takes longer
[29:09] to come to fruition than what you
[29:10] thought because I can tell you that even
[29:12] back in sort of late 2013 and 14 there
[29:14] were people saying then that it's going
[29:16] to go it's going to run in that that you
[29:18] know just in that cycle it's going to
[29:20] run to a price that we still are not
[29:23] holding on to today okay like it's going
[29:26] to run to $40,000 $100,000 this is 10
[29:28] years ago um and of course we've all
[29:30] heard the other insane predictions that
[29:32] maffy made and Tim Draper and pretty
[29:35] much every bull prediction every
[29:38] prediction made by the uh bulls or the
[29:42] well-known influence of bulls uh has
[29:44] taken Eva still is yet to come true and
[29:47] is many many years behind five six years
[29:50] behind in many cases uh not only is it
[29:53] behind but has even still failed to
[29:55] reach the targets that they set and may
[29:57] not do for another five or so years uh
[29:59] but again have patience sit tight you
[30:01] will do better on this than you'll do on
[30:03] other things but don't expect to be
[30:05] retiring you know this year or next year
[30:08] necessarily I mean I'm not saying that
[30:09] it won't it could anything could could I
[30:11] mean it's certainly a hell of a lot
[30:12] likely that could shoot to a million
[30:14] dollars this year than it would than it
[30:16] is to go to say I don't know a few
[30:18] thousand dollar like that like to the
[30:20] balance of that definitely but
[30:23] um the the fact is though that over time
[30:27] uh over the whole time I've been through
[30:28] I've noticed that things have taken a
[30:30] little longer to come to fruition now on
[30:32] the other hand the Bears on the other
[30:35] hand they've even even been more wrong
[30:37] because the Bears are the ones who've
[30:39] been they always seem to say well it's
[30:40] going to zero or there was some idiot
[30:43] who even said somehow it would go to it
[30:46] would go negative like how does that
[30:47] work you know thaty he said it on show
[30:49] wrong it was I think Peter Sian or
[30:52] something like it was like that that
[30:54] that was hilarious someone could explain
[30:56] that to me I don't know how something
[30:58] can have a negative price like How could
[31:00] an immaterial asset that I don't that
[31:02] doesn't cost me anything to hold how
[31:04] that could somehow require me to pay
[31:07] money in order to get rid of it I'm not
[31:09] sure how that works but anyhow um but
[31:11] even then the bear is saying it's going
[31:12] to go to um there was a the most famous
[31:16] example I think from the earlier days
[31:17] was Professor bitco um you could look up
[31:20] Professor Bitcoin um he was a never
[31:22] heard that well yeah he was a professor
[31:24] again we we Bitcoin has an interesting
[31:27] um an interesting history with
[31:29] professors professors have not done very
[31:31] well against Bitcoin um professors uh
[31:36] perhaps rank only behind economists I'm
[31:38] not sure maybe it's the other way around
[31:40] but professors and economists rank very
[31:43] closely together to between um bitcoin's
[31:45] most embarrassed people so the people
[31:47] that Bitcoin has managed to humiliate
[31:49] the hardest um I'm not sure whether
[31:51] they're professors or they're economists
[31:53] but uh both of those classes of people
[31:55] um come very close so have having had
[31:58] their intellectual asses handed to them
[32:01] by Bitcoin I mean these are people that
[32:03] identify as smart people um but it turns
[32:07] out I were not nearly as smart as they
[32:10] thought they were they were smart in
[32:12] their particular domain perhaps uh well
[32:15] at least as smart as anybody who can
[32:17] remember unthinkingly a collection of
[32:20] facts and dogmas as they were taught
[32:22] them um but uh as soon as they're par
[32:27] but they failed to understand that
[32:28] perhaps their Paradigm the very Paradigm
[32:30] upon which their expertise and knowledge
[32:32] was based um was actually open to
[32:35] question and not only did Bitcoin
[32:37] question it um uh but it proved it um
[32:41] entirely unnecessary an unnecessary set
[32:44] of assumptions in order to uh in order
[32:47] from which a system could run um but
[32:49] this professor Bitcoin predicted that
[32:51] famously that and this was back in I
[32:53] think 2015 or something that Bitcoin
[32:55] would before this was when Bitcoin was
[32:57] trading I think you know maybe five or
[32:59] $600 um that Bitcoin would crash to $10
[33:03] a share by you know 204 or 15 or
[33:06] something like that you know uh again it
[33:09] was a bare prediction that put Bitcoin
[33:11] at like 1% of what it was currently
[33:13] trading at now even Bitcoin has had some
[33:17] Almighty crashes at the worst of times
[33:19] but even then we're talking an 80% drop
[33:22] at the very from the very top to the
[33:24] very bottom but both the very top and
[33:26] the very bottom were only point that
[33:28] were held for very brief periods of time
[33:31] um when you average it out Bitcoin has
[33:34] had quite a decent steady upward run um
[33:38] you know for for its entire existence so
[33:41] um so yeah these guys I I I say that
[33:44] about the the influence of bulls but at
[33:46] least those guys were ultimately
[33:48] directionally correct and were
[33:51] encouraging people to make ultimately
[33:52] the right decision I mean okay if you if
[33:55] you'd listened to the guy that said that
[33:57] Bitcoin was going to a million dollars
[33:58] by
[34:00] 2022 you haven't really been harmed by
[34:02] that you bought you bought you still you
[34:05] bought Bitcoin on the strength of that
[34:06] information um you're still up you know
[34:10] it's better than having not bought it's
[34:11] better than listening to the Bears where
[34:12] you wouldn't have bought at all so um so
[34:14] the Bears are the ones you definitely
[34:16] don't want to listen to and when it
[34:17] comes to some of like the the really
[34:19] vocal Bulls just Tempo your
[34:22] expectations um in terms of uh in terms
[34:25] of your own plans for what you intend to
[34:27] do with your vastly appreciated Bitcoin
[34:31] I partnered up with coin vigilante this
[34:34] is the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[34:37] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[34:40] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[34:43] vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin watch
[34:46] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[34:49] go out there and show that you are a
[34:52] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[34:54] Bitcoin only and coin vigilant just
[34:57] dropped a completely new and amazing
[35:00] Genesis edition of their watch
[35:03] collections you have the date of the
[35:05] first ever mined Bitcoin Block in there
[35:08] and of course also the block height and
[35:11] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[35:14] the level of detail they put in in this
[35:17] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[35:19] those amazing coin Vilan the time pieces
[35:23] down in the descriptions I love those
[35:25] watches so so much if you watch or
[35:28] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[35:31] I'll guess you already bought some
[35:33] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[35:35] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[35:39] in a hardware wallet my personal
[35:41] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[35:43] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[35:45] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[35:47] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[35:50] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[35:54] with the code Robin at the checkout
[35:56] visit bitbox . Swiss robobin to get your
[36:01] bitbox and the next step is to really
[36:03] level up your sovereignty as an
[36:05] individual you have to have the most
[36:07] secure self- custody setup you have to
[36:10] secure your own devices you have to
[36:13] protect your privacy you have to set up
[36:16] an inheritance plan and depending on
[36:18] where you live you even want to have a
[36:21] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[36:23] in case something goes really really
[36:25] wrong and through all those steps the
[36:27] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[36:30] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[36:33] way.com
[36:34] Partners Robin you even get a 30 minute
[36:38] free call to find out how you can level
[36:40] up your sovereignty there's so much in
[36:43] there um first of all um just quickly on
[36:47] the retiring topic because it's such a
[36:49] popular Topic in in Bitcoin um uh I I I
[36:54] want to touch on that a little bit and I
[36:55] also get want to get your take on that
[36:58] um because I I I do think there are a
[37:00] lot of people that say like oh like I
[37:01] have de amount of Bitcoin can I retire
[37:03] like I literally get DMs like that and
[37:06] I'm always saying like hey like that's
[37:07] your money your decision I don't know
[37:09] anything about your life so uh take this
[37:11] decision yourself I can take it for you
[37:13] um but in a general term I usually say
[37:16] like okay think about what is the worst
[37:18] drop that can happen for Bitcoin let's
[37:20] say 80% uh think about let's let's say
[37:24] Bitcoin stays there for like four years
[37:27] which uh um probably won't happen but if
[37:30] you really want to retire on bitcoin you
[37:31] should think about the worst case
[37:33] situation and if you're like if you have
[37:35] enough Bitcoin if Bitcoin drops 80% and
[37:38] Bitcoin is down for four years and you
[37:41] can still um uh live till 150 years old
[37:45] and you still have enough money yeah
[37:47] maybe you can actually retire and you
[37:49] have to make the calculations Al with
[37:50] inflation and stuff like that there's so
[37:52] many variables to to to go to go into
[37:55] that thing and and most people most
[37:57] people that think about retiring on on
[37:59] bitcoin shouldn't do it that's that's my
[38:02] unpopular unpopular opinion but it it's
[38:05] uh yeah it's a it's a it's something
[38:08] that gets talked a lot about in Bitcoin
[38:10] oh like retire on one Bitcoin retire on
[38:11] 0.1 Bitcoin retire on 0.21 bitcoin or
[38:15] two two Bitcoin it's it's it's it's it's
[38:17] a weird one what what is your take on
[38:19] retiring on bitcoin well first of all
[38:21] obviously depends on the purchasing
[38:22] power that Bitcoin has at the time
[38:24] you're retiring now most people that I
[38:26] experience in the Bitcoin world and not
[38:28] of geriatric retiring age you know now
[38:32] it would really suck if you had saved up
[38:35] and you know you'd put all of your
[38:36] superannuation into Bitcoin and you're
[38:38] in your late 70s or something like this
[38:39] or you've only likely to live
[38:42] statistically you know another 10 years
[38:44] or 20 years or something like that and
[38:46] you put all your super into Bitcoin and
[38:47] then Bitcoin drops 80% right when you
[38:51] know you really needed to enjoy your
[38:52] golden years and not work anymore that
[38:55] obviously would really suck but I don't
[38:57] think that's a very great many people in
[39:00] this space certainly not likely to be
[39:02] the people your you your listeners here
[39:05] today I think that for most people
[39:07] they're still
[39:08] working productive people and if you
[39:11] would if they were to have an 80%
[39:14] crash now I don't some people sort of
[39:17] even yearn for this sort of thing to
[39:18] happen they yearn for a crash like that
[39:20] because it will like let them stack more
[39:23] um I don't necessarily think that's
[39:27] great thing for Bitcoin I think I would
[39:29] look forward to bitcoin becoming a bit
[39:30] more steady because then we can get more
[39:32] stuff built on bitcoin and we can you
[39:34] know um start to it can start to mature
[39:36] as an asset we can do things likeit it
[39:38] could be things like Bitcoin lending and
[39:40] and all sorts of things like this to
[39:41] prevent you from ever even needing to to
[39:43] sell your Bitcoin if you can borrow
[39:44] against it and there can be a sort of
[39:47] steady growth rate still there but apart
[39:50] from that very small class of elderly
[39:51] people um you know if you're not the
[39:54] main thing is is that you're not leverag
[39:56] the only people that really get messed
[39:58] up when there's like an 80% drop like
[40:01] that are the people that were on
[40:03] Leverage the people that you know
[40:04] borrowed to buy Bitcoin and then they
[40:06] get called on those loans um if you're
[40:10] if you're in it for the long term then
[40:12] four years is not a long time
[40:14] particularly if you've only been I I
[40:17] personally don't think you should even
[40:18] be thinking about touching your Bitcoin
[40:20] for at least 10 years like I don't think
[40:22] a 10year hle period is too much to ask
[40:25] for something like this before you would
[40:27] considered you
[40:29] know uh taking as as it were when I say
[40:32] taking something off the table I think
[40:33] we're all well enough understanding of
[40:35] what Bitcoin is that we're not going
[40:36] back to Fiat for any price but the idea
[40:39] that you would might spend some of it on
[40:41] luxuries or upgrades to your life I
[40:43] think it's pretty reasonable that people
[40:44] should hold for at least 10 years or
[40:46] three Cycles you do that you don't have
[40:50] to worry about 80% 80% will be long you
[40:53] could get an 80% in one cycle but even
[40:55] then it's very brief and if you're not
[40:56] leveraged you can weather that I mean uh
[41:00] Mo most people that have been around for
[41:01] a few Cycles have had to sit through
[41:03] that two or three times now and if you
[41:06] just it's avoiding the Temptation people
[41:09] see the problem a lot of times where
[41:11] people got unstuck with Bitcoin is they
[41:14] couldn't resist the temptation to do
[41:16] something with it for some reason for
[41:18] many people the hardest thing to do was
[41:20] just to Simply buy the Bitcoin take it
[41:22] off the exchange and put it into your
[41:24] own Cold Storage that's all you don't
[41:27] have to trade it you don't have to uh
[41:30] stake it you don't have to go and do
[41:33] whatever other fancy defi type [ __ ]
[41:35] that there is to do with it buy it put
[41:38] it away forget about it go do your do
[41:41] whatever it is you do do your work and
[41:42] then use whatever access you've got that
[41:45] would otherwise have just gone into Fiat
[41:47] Savings in the bank just save that as
[41:49] Bitcoin because we've proven that
[41:51] Bitcoin is a Superior Savings vehicle
[41:54] you do that um 80% 80% drops will only
[41:58] help you get more Bitcoin um as from uh
[42:03] from your savings that the savings as
[42:05] you as you ACR savings from from work um
[42:09] and if you've sa and if you've held for
[42:12] the all of those Cycles then if there's
[42:14] an 80% drop maybe you've got to delay
[42:17] that plan by another year or two before
[42:19] it recovers it always recovers because
[42:21] there are so many buyers of Last Resort
[42:23] out there and there are so many people
[42:24] now that would die for an 80% pullback I
[42:27] mean like a lot of people I think you
[42:29] know I must confess I don't think I'd
[42:31] enjoy I think I've had enough personally
[42:34] I think I've had enough of my own 80%
[42:35] pullbacks I wouldn't enjoy it too much
[42:37] but I know for a fact that there are a
[42:39] lot of people out there that would
[42:40] absolutely be delighted if there was an
[42:42] 80% pullback because they would just
[42:44] they would just load up on that they
[42:46] would be backing up the dump truck and
[42:48] uh or not the dump truck they'd be
[42:50] backing up the trailer um and that alone
[42:53] the number of people that would just
[42:55] just grab that opportunity would
[42:57] probably put the price back where it is
[42:59] relatively quickly I I just want to pull
[43:01] it up uh because uh I made that uh
[43:04] Community post uh uh recently with where
[43:09] is it let me see um let me share the
[43:12] screen I I actually asked that question
[43:15] fairly recently in my community um it is
[43:20] yeah exactly right here it actually got
[43:22] over a thousand votes in in just a day
[43:24] um what would you prefer for B Bitcoin
[43:27] 2025 cheaper sets under 120k or Bitcoin
[43:30] ripping to 1 million and that's a lot of
[43:34] people 33% you won't find any investor
[43:36] where someone has an in investment and
[43:38] you get 33% of the investors in a thing
[43:41] saying that they want it to be
[43:43] cheaper that never
[43:45] happens that that's that that that's
[43:47] very true like bit bitcoiners are uh
[43:50] have a different con you you can also
[43:51] see that from the hotle periods like how
[43:53] long they they don't move any any Sates
[43:56] from the wallets I think any stock would
[43:58] be delighted to even have something
[44:01] close to that of like such a baseline of
[44:03] hotos that just like are unwilling to
[44:06] move it even in like five years where it
[44:09] went up like crazy yeah the the and the
[44:12] anti- Bitcoin people just don't get that
[44:14] because I think a lot of the anti-
[44:16] Bitcoin people maybe this is just people
[44:17] in general a lot of people in general
[44:20] are not capable of you might have heard
[44:22] of the concept of the kinyan beauty
[44:24] Beauty uh what is it the the kinyan
[44:26] beauty contest and the Kian beauty
[44:29] contest is the idea that instead of
[44:31] voting for you know the prettiest girl
[44:33] or model or whatever it is in the
[44:34] contest you vote for the one that you
[44:37] think is going to get the most votes so
[44:39] instead of thinking so instead of
[44:41] applying your what you think what you
[44:44] judge to be the the most beautiful girl
[44:48] in the contest you try to imagine what
[44:50] others might consider to be that and
[44:53] it's not necessarily the same thing and
[44:55] same thing when it comes to bitcoin coin
[44:57] I mean so many people just like you
[45:00] could hate Bitcoin but at the same time
[45:02] understand that hey this thing has all
[45:04] of these like completely almost
[45:06] fanatical determined people that will
[45:08] buy it at any price and who will support
[45:11] the
[45:12] market that alone is still that's that's
[45:15] an argument right there for actually
[45:16] having some yourself even if you don't
[45:18] believe in it um but that takes a sort
[45:20] of second order level of thinking that I
[45:23] don't think a lot of people are um are
[45:25] capable of um of employing one other
[45:27] thing that you raised uh was really
[45:30] interesting of like this diminishing
[45:32] returns and also that that ripping
[45:35] through like a million um do you think
[45:38] um like I think paralo is popularized
[45:40] that like this gradually then suddenly
[45:42] and I think that's what um there's a
[45:44] theory of like we will have diminishing
[45:46] returns like this kind of power law and
[45:48] those those kind of price models where
[45:49] like we get a little less every year of
[45:52] but it's still like a high fast growing
[45:54] and that is like like we and S curve and
[45:57] at some point we'll reach that point
[45:59] where we just rip for like two years
[46:01] straight up and it just almost goes to
[46:03] heaven um do you think we we we might
[46:07] hit that that point or we just like
[46:09] gradually organically grow uh in the
[46:12] obviously it's hard to predict but what
[46:14] your thoughts I think it's possible and
[46:16] I I don't necessarily think it's that
[46:18] probable though but I say it's possible
[46:19] and I'll be celebrating as hard as
[46:21] anybody else if it does do that if it
[46:22] rips to a million this year or whatever
[46:24] it goes to and we just get that that
[46:26] infl ction point in the curve they talk
[46:28] about you know because so far the last
[46:30] 15 years it has indeed I mean that's
[46:33] just what we've observed whether you
[46:34] like it or not that's what's happened it
[46:35] has been a a diminishing returns thing
[46:38] and it will it may continue to be
[46:40] diminishing returns until it isn't but
[46:42] the thing is is that we have no way of
[46:44] knowing nor do we have any particular
[46:46] evidence for a particular inflection
[46:47] point just suddenly happening and
[46:49] bitcoin's Rise accelerating up again and
[46:52] here's where I want to sound another
[46:54] note of caution based on history of
[46:57] these sorts of predictions in general
[47:00] now if you take a look at the gold gold
[47:04] bugs the gold
[47:05] industry now their proponents since
[47:09] since America went off the gold standard
[47:11] in
[47:12] 1971 almost from that day you can go to
[47:16] this day you can go back and you can
[47:17] look at the various like you know sort
[47:19] of archival stuff you know where they've
[47:21] uh you know got saved articles from
[47:24] decades ago you can find them on the
[47:26] Internet
[47:27] where and and these go these have been
[47:29] going on for 50 years ever since the
[47:32] America went off the gold standard but
[47:33] for 50 years gold bugs almost every week
[47:36] without fail have had some sort of
[47:39] reason or some sort of like big news
[47:41] item that they've brought up to say that
[47:43] this is why Bitcoin is sorry this is why
[47:46] gold is going to go parabolic next week
[47:49] because the government just announced
[47:51] this or this uh line on this graph
[47:54] crossed over here and went this way and
[47:56] that means that this is going to happen
[47:57] and that therefore means that gold is
[47:59] going to go parabolic next week and you
[48:01] know and it's usually also accompanied
[48:04] with the idea that the um the economy is
[48:06] going to collapse as well that's sort of
[48:09] everyone who doesn't own gold is going
[48:11] to be poor and penniless and those that
[48:13] own gold are going to find that that
[48:15] that they own everything and that and
[48:16] there's going to be a sort of
[48:18] hyperinflationary um increase in the
[48:21] fortunes of people that own gold and
[48:22] everyone else who doesn't have it is
[48:24] going to be left with you know will is
[48:27] full of money buying a loaf of bread we
[48:28] are Republic kind of stuff but of course
[48:31] that hasn't happened now as Skeptics of
[48:34] the theat financial system we know it's
[48:36] unsustainable but it has a way of the PE
[48:41] the way it's been run though does have a
[48:43] way of the can it has been able to be
[48:45] kicked down the road like for five
[48:48] decades now and could potentially be
[48:50] kicked down the road a lot longer now it
[48:53] can't obviously do it forever but that
[48:55] becomes a sort of academic point if it
[48:58] gets kicked down if that can or and and
[49:01] in our case the idea that suddenly the
[49:03] Bitcoin scurve is going to turn an
[49:05] inflection and go vertical if that point
[49:08] is beyond our own
[49:11] lifetimes then um you know it's sort of
[49:14] an academic point a lot of gold bugs
[49:16] have died in the 50 years since those
[49:17] predictions were started to be the same
[49:20] kind of prediction the same kind of
[49:21] rhetoric from those guys exactly the
[49:23] same just put Bitcoin in there instead
[49:25] of gold that same rhetoric a lot of
[49:28] bitcoiners have died and you know
[49:30] there's no point being now of course I
[49:32] know people want to leave a legacy and
[49:34] family and and leave pass it on I
[49:36] understand all of that but generally
[49:38] people do look at their lives as a
[49:40] finite thing and you have to think well
[49:42] yeah I've like money's the means to an
[49:44] end what's the what was the point of all
[49:46] of this if I die um the if I'm in some
[49:50] future point you know in if in the year
[49:54] 2150 I'm the richest bitcoiner in the
[49:56] Cemetery it's not much is it's not much
[49:59] of a point then yeah I guess I was I
[50:01] guess I guess that the the Bitcoin um or
[50:05] the Fiat doomsayers were ultimately
[50:07] right but um not early enough for it to
[50:10] mean anything to those people that were
[50:13] that are that are um putting their
[50:15] savings into it today I don't think it
[50:18] will take that long but it does have a
[50:20] way though of taking a lot longer than
[50:23] what the um the Bulls and the proponents
[50:26] of of of of Bitcoin or in historical
[50:29] case for the last 50 years gold think
[50:31] that it's going to do even in the worst
[50:33] thing you know the whole big Financial
[50:35] meltdown of uh of
[50:37] 2008 the can just got kicked out I mean
[50:40] it was total [ __ ] what happened I
[50:41] mean it's a total scam I mean we know it
[50:43] was a total the bailouts the whole thing
[50:45] was a total
[50:47] scam but they got away with it I mean
[50:49] they got away with it and uh and the
[50:52] general public just did not care enough
[50:54] about it to really do what they used to
[50:56] do to Bankers there was a a thing that
[50:58] used to be done to Bankers historically
[51:00] if they couldn't uh if they couldn't if
[51:03] you took your gold certificates down to
[51:05] the to the money changer and he'd
[51:07] fractionally reserved too much of the
[51:09] gold and couldn't redeem it um history
[51:12] records what used to happen to those
[51:14] guys so um but people didn't care enough
[51:18] about what happened in the global
[51:20] financial crisis their lives were still
[51:22] they were kind of just comfortable I
[51:23] guess it didn't you know somehow they
[51:25] managed to Kick the Can down the road
[51:26] keep the system going and everyone could
[51:28] just go back into the Matrix and into
[51:30] their their comfortable lives and and
[51:33] and get on with things um so yeah that's
[51:36] what I say there it's um don't be
[51:38] surprised if it can be kicked down the
[51:40] road a lot longer than what you think
[51:41] and so again um don't plan your life
[51:45] around it necessarily happening too
[51:48] soon yeah I think that's a really good
[51:50] point of like don't even if you're in
[51:53] the opinion that we will have a bit
[51:57] in like 20 27 or something like that um
[52:00] don't plan your life around that don't
[52:02] buy options for 2030 or something like
[52:04] that like that would be that would be
[52:08] stupid um but it it is kind of a miracle
[52:11] that that this can is like it's like a
[52:13] soda can that you didn't open but you
[52:15] kick it down the road and and you're
[52:16] just waiting till it finally explodes
[52:19] and you're like oh it's going for a long
[52:21] while and it's it's still there and it's
[52:24] for me uh really fascinating that that
[52:27] that yeah like fear system is still
[52:28] around people people still use it people
[52:31] still trust and believe in it like if I
[52:33] talk to family members that I don't talk
[52:36] that much like the closest the closer to
[52:38] my family members are the more they are
[52:40] in Bitcoin is like a a pyramid thing
[52:42] going on and the further away they are
[52:45] from me the the further into fear they
[52:47] still are usually um when I talk to them
[52:50] uh they they really see the value in the
[52:55] Euro they're like this has value like I
[52:57] can buy things from that they're really
[52:59] deep into that and maybe it's just a a
[53:02] really hard Network effect of fear to to
[53:05] crack it takes time for that Network
[53:07] effect to unravel and and build into
[53:10] Bitcoin the same way as Facebook is
[53:12] still around I'm like who uses Facebook
[53:15] still butb is still the biggest social
[53:17] media yeah there's a great deal of
[53:19] inertia there and it's funny because
[53:21] people don't they don't apply the same
[53:24] level of scrutiny to what is the default
[53:27] thing that they already have to a new
[53:29] thing that comes along it's like because
[53:31] they'll compare always they won't have
[53:34] back any scrutiny at all of the current
[53:35] thing but the new thing will always be
[53:37] compared to the perfect it won't be
[53:39] compared to what we've got it'll always
[53:40] be compared to the perfect so for
[53:41] example even though we know uh you know
[53:45] there's a certain number of crashes
[53:46] every year due to driver error right
[53:48] drivers on the road crashing their cars
[53:51] but the one time the self-driving car
[53:53] has an accident W oh take them all off
[53:57] the road like this is this technology
[53:59] doesn't work like even though it's like
[54:01] even if it had like a 100 times lower
[54:03] crash rate it would not be tolerated we
[54:06] we would be banned and we'd have to go
[54:07] back until you know until it was Zero um
[54:10] and it's the same thing with money like
[54:12] people just don't ask any questions it's
[54:14] like accepted it's internalized it's the
[54:16] default thing and and it was and that's
[54:20] what the difference was I think with me
[54:22] sort of earlier on in that I'd already
[54:24] kind of become interest I tend to be you
[54:26] sort of see my bit of my vintage
[54:28] electronics behind I'm a bit of a guy
[54:30] that likes to understand how things work
[54:32] machines and things like that and
[54:34] systems and all that sort of thing and
[54:37] one of the most interesting ones because
[54:38] it's one that considering the part that
[54:41] it plays in people's everyday life I
[54:42] mean it's it's either they're spending a
[54:45] big chunk of their life earning it and
[54:46] the other waking chunk of their life
[54:48] deciding and rationing out how they're
[54:50] going to spend it so pretty much the
[54:52] question of money or what money is or
[54:55] money itself rather figures into
[54:57] virtually everything people do on every
[54:59] day of their lives yet people put very
[55:02] little thought into how money actually
[55:05] works at what it is and even before
[55:07] hearing about Bitcoin I had sort of gone
[55:10] a little bit down that rabbit hole down
[55:11] some of those things you know the the
[55:14] idea of how the US Federal Reserve came
[55:16] about uh throughout history and the
[55:18] various attempts to oppose it by more
[55:20] noble US presidents throughout
[55:22] throughout history and uh and and the
[55:24] implications for enslavement and theft
[55:27] of the pop from and and plundering of
[55:29] the population the establishment of a a
[55:31] central Reserve Bank Federal Reserve
[55:34] Bank system would would allow so I was
[55:37] already and so and I already understood
[55:39] the idea that effectively Fiat money
[55:41] means it's just given value because it
[55:43] says it has value it has nothing behind
[55:45] it it's just a promise a promise based
[55:47] on really ultimately a promise that's
[55:50] only enforceable so long as everybody
[55:52] continues to believe in the shared
[55:54] fiction um but ultimately not based on
[55:56] gold that was the other naive thing see
[55:58] a lot of people naively think that it's
[55:59] all backed by gold in a vault somewhere
[56:02] there's the equivalent value of gold
[56:03] behind this piece of paper that's why
[56:05] the piece of paper has value no hasn't
[56:07] been true since
[56:08] 1971 uh then you learn that okay then
[56:11] people also naively think that when they
[56:13] go to borrow money from the bank well
[56:14] then they're just
[56:15] borrowing the equival like money
[56:18] somebody else put in the bank is saving
[56:20] no doesn't work that way either the
[56:22] money is created out of nothing when the
[56:24] when the loan is signed for and even the
[56:27] idea of fractional Reserve banking the
[56:28] reserve requirement isn't even like 10%
[56:32] not only is it less than 10% reserves in
[56:35] things but it's 10% of other countries
[56:38] Fiat currencies so it's not even like
[56:40] okay if we're going to have like if the
[56:42] bank has you know hundred has a trillion
[56:45] dollars out there in loans then it holds
[56:49] you know 100 billion in reserve it does
[56:51] but those Reserve assets are in
[56:53] themselves Fiat that that in a circular
[56:55] way is has its assets backing it or the
[56:59] 10% of it in feat of the of the other
[57:02] country so ultimately there's like it's
[57:04] like a whole smoke and mirrors um
[57:06] circular logic um fugazi that has no
[57:11] real value behind it at all and so I
[57:14] find that a very rich criticism when
[57:16] people come along and say well what's
[57:17] Bitcoin backed by or is it has it got
[57:20] any intrinsic value the whole the whole
[57:22] argument doesn't for a start is a
[57:24] hypocritical one because you're not
[57:25] asking of the thing that you think has
[57:27] value um but it also misunderstands um
[57:30] what money even is money is just a
[57:33] ledger uh for who owes what to whom and
[57:36] so if um and Bitcoin is just a far more
[57:40] trustworthy way of storing that
[57:42] information then centralized systems
[57:44] that people behind those systems can uh
[57:47] change the rules of and create more
[57:49] tokens uh for themselves so there's none
[57:52] of that scrutiny you get none of that
[57:53] scrutiny with the people that that are
[57:55] that seem to
[57:56] always think that Fiat has value to them
[57:59] and above above what Bitcoin could
[58:01] possibly be um it's sort of that and
[58:05] shitcoins that I think that are the two
[58:07] most um difficult hurdles to deal with
[58:10] when you're trying to convince people
[58:11] that Bitcoin is and only Bitcoins as far
[58:14] as uh cryptocurrencies are concerned are
[58:17] where they need to be or indeed any
[58:19] currency for that matter Bitcoin is the
[58:21] place that they need to be it's like
[58:23] yeah it's either fat on the one side or
[58:25] [ __ ] coins on the other when you know we
[58:28] all we all we need is this one one thing
[58:31] and it's it's something that enemies can
[58:34] even agree on like
[58:36] you that's that's its that's its beauty
[58:38] I could I could talk longer about that
[58:40] but I think I'll let you jump back in
[58:44] yeah the enemies part is really
[58:46] interesting you can see it um even
[58:48] within the Bitcoin Community because
[58:50] there's this thing of like what what is
[58:51] a Bitcoin uh but there's no like one
[58:55] Bitcoin we already have such a uh big
[58:59] community that there are for like that's
[59:01] always my favorite example there are raw
[59:03] weaking that only need plantbased there
[59:05] are people that only need meat that are
[59:08] pure canival and they both agree on the
[59:10] Bitcoin protocol as being their money
[59:12] and their belief system so um it it's
[59:16] definitely something that that like
[59:19] people that otherwise would fight a lot
[59:21] actually could agree on and and that
[59:24] that that's really really interesting of
[59:26] of a point uh but what I wanted to ask
[59:30] you especially because you are so so
[59:32] long in Bitcoin and you have seen so
[59:34] many developments and we have for
[59:36] example the block siiz war that arguably
[59:39] proved the decentralization of Bitcoin
[59:41] we had more and more developments um H
[59:45] how can we make Bitcoin even more stable
[59:49] even more decentralized even more
[59:51] resilient against uh attacks uh in the
[59:55] future do you see any improvements that
[59:57] that you're like okay I don't know like
[59:59] maybe with mining pools or anything like
[60:01] that you we like we we we still have to
[60:04] work that we get even more
[60:06] decentralized a few things here well
[60:08] first of all let's take the the first
[60:10] idea of mining uh Bitcoin is has uh as a
[60:15] as a single entity if you consider as an
[60:18] entity the amount of computing power on
[60:20] that is now orders of magnitude more
[60:22] than any other type of computing
[60:24] anywhere in the world there's no
[60:26] no one has got any realistic chance of
[60:28] ever being able to sort of pull off a
[60:30] 51% attack by establishing a a competing
[60:34] uh amount of hashing power to do that in
[60:36] fact Bitcoin already has many orders of
[60:39] magnitude more hashing power devoted
[60:41] pointed towards it than it would need to
[60:43] fend off such an attack however the
[60:47] mining is
[60:48] somewhat I won't say it's sort of
[60:51] centralizing into sort of some large
[60:53] pools and there's a push to get more
[60:57] people involved in run doing what it's
[61:00] just called simply solo mining just
[61:03] running small their own small or it's
[61:06] also called Lottery mining is another
[61:07] word for it but there's a device called
[61:09] a bid ax that allows people to run a
[61:12] small amount of hash power from their
[61:13] own home computer a small but not
[61:16] completely meaningful meaningless amount
[61:18] I mean in fact occasionally people what
[61:19] there's been one or two blocks that
[61:21] people running such small desktop mining
[61:23] rigs at home have managed to um to to to
[61:26] achieve but to manage to
[61:28] win so that allows mining a lot of you
[61:33] know essentially potentially millions of
[61:35] people to separately run miners
[61:37] independently of any mining pool um in
[61:40] addition to that we want to encourage
[61:42] more people to run nodes because nodes
[61:44] are ultimately the devices that enforce
[61:47] the rules of the network because they
[61:49] determine what blocks of
[61:52] transactions are considered valid and
[61:54] therefore propagated through the Network
[61:57] and uh and in fact it was nodes and that
[62:01] that won the block size war no it the
[62:03] block size War proved that it was nodes
[62:06] and those running and and forming a
[62:09] consensus as to what version of the
[62:10] software and what version of Bitcoin
[62:12] they determined to be the true Bitcoin
[62:15] that's what won it because the miners
[62:16] were overwhelmingly in favor of fking
[62:18] off um the way that Bitcoin cash went
[62:22] into sort of bigger blocks it was it
[62:24] started off with a fight over should
[62:26] Bitcoin increase its block
[62:28] size um in fact I will just backtrack a
[62:30] little bit there because perhaps some of
[62:32] your listeners are not familiar with
[62:34] what occurred in the blocksize war so
[62:36] for many years up leading up to I guess
[62:38] the final conf the final battle as it
[62:41] were um there was a debate in the
[62:43] community as to how Bitcoin should scale
[62:47] and one of the ways in which is one one
[62:50] group of people felt that the blocks
[62:51] need to remain small such that it would
[62:55] always be easy for almost anybody to run
[62:57] a node and therefore keep the network
[63:01] decentralized there was another group of
[63:03] people though who thought no the way to
[63:04] scale Bitcoin is that um we need to
[63:07] allow the blocks to get bigger and
[63:08] bigger and bigger so that we can fit
[63:09] more transactions in and so they
[63:11] initially proposed you know I think a a
[63:14] fairly large block size increase but
[63:16] eventually came down to being will to
[63:18] sort of want to have a increase to about
[63:21] doubling the block size but even then
[63:24] there was a even if even if the even if
[63:26] the block size had doubled an important
[63:28] principle would have been broken it
[63:30] would have because if we doubled it then
[63:32] there would have been nothing to really
[63:34] stop people from doubling it again in
[63:36] the future and again and again and again
[63:38] and no amount of doubling of the block
[63:40] of the block size would have made
[63:42] Bitcoin scale because Bitcoin on its
[63:44] base layer is only capable of of maybe
[63:47] doing you know sort of with with the new
[63:50] upgrades they did end up making um maybe
[63:52] sort of 14 transactions a second or
[63:54] something like that now even if you
[63:56] doubled that tripled it quadrupled it 10
[63:58] times it 100 times it it's still not
[64:00] going to be enough to do every single
[64:02] transaction in the world on the based
[64:04] layer it would have always been
[64:05] necessary in any case to aggregate small
[64:09] transactions on abstraction layers above
[64:12] the Bitcoin base
[64:14] layer and so but if you if we just
[64:18] allowed it to double if the if if the
[64:20] people had just agreed to it to double
[64:21] then there wouldn't have been much
[64:22] incentive to develop these abstraction
[64:25] layers and so it likely just would have
[64:28] just kept on people would have just
[64:29] taken the lazy option and just kept
[64:31] doubling doing the simple just changing
[64:33] literally one variable in the code which
[64:36] is like the laziest and dumbest way of
[64:37] solving this problem uh and and and
[64:40] increasing the block size and what it
[64:42] would have done is eventually it would
[64:43] have meant that it would have meant that
[64:45] you would have only had like Amazon or
[64:47] Google like entities data centers that
[64:50] sort of thing from being able to run a
[64:53] node and nodes are the really were the
[64:55] Frontline defense in non-consensus hard
[64:59] Forks of the of the Bitcoin blockchain
[65:02] it would have been like all these fears
[65:03] people have now about Black Rock being
[65:06] able to oh what if Black Rock decides
[65:08] that it wants to increase the number of
[65:10] Bitcoin there are or whatever else or
[65:12] take control of the network in some
[65:13] other way well you know what if we'd
[65:14] listened to those big block people it
[65:17] may well have been a lot easier for for
[65:19] for an entity like that to make a change
[65:21] to bitcoin but right now you've got
[65:23] hundreds of thousands of people all over
[65:25] the world running nodes and unless those
[65:28] guys are like unless a very very large
[65:31] majority of those people agree to a
[65:33] change then they won't recognize blocks
[65:36] that try to change the rules
[65:39] um and meanwhile it also means that by
[65:44] keeping the block small and by
[65:45] concentrating on the second layers that
[65:47] is a far more sustainable way of growing
[65:50] Bitcoin because now with that with
[65:52] something like the lightning Network
[65:53] because this is the thing the people
[65:54] that were against that wanted to
[65:56] increase the they're still out there
[65:58] like little Japanese holdout soldiers in
[66:00] foxholes in the 1970s fighting World War
[66:04] II like there were those Japanese that
[66:06] that didn't realize that the war was
[66:08] over and that the country had been
[66:09] defeated that would not surrender at any
[66:11] cost and were still firing from some of
[66:13] the little Islands um that the Japanese
[66:16] had occupied during the war and there is
[66:18] still the equivalent of those people now
[66:20] in the big block Camp sniping at Bitcoin
[66:23] from the sidelines saying that you know
[66:25] that that it should have gone we should
[66:28] have done things their way um but that
[66:31] would have then sa sacrificed the most
[66:32] sacran and Irreplaceable part of Bitcoin
[66:35] and that is its its censorship
[66:38] resistance and immutability of its of
[66:40] its blockchain the
[66:42] scaling we can do the scaling we just
[66:44] don't need to do it on the bottom block
[66:46] we do that on the lightning Network
[66:47] which these guys want to pretend doesn't
[66:49] even exist you never hear them
[66:50] mentioning it we do that so for every
[66:52] transaction that you do on the main
[66:54] chain you could have thousands or even
[66:56] hundreds of thousands of lightning
[66:58] Network
[66:59] transactions because the fact is is that
[67:02] we don't need to keep everybody's coffee
[67:04] and beer and trivial purchase we don't
[67:07] need to have every one of those little
[67:08] purchases propagated to every node on
[67:10] the network in the whole world and held
[67:12] in every one of them until the end of
[67:14] time it's a ridiculous level of uh of
[67:19] archiving and security for small
[67:22] transactions now on the other hand if
[67:24] you were purchasing I don't know um
[67:28] Greenland then that would might you
[67:31] might do that as an on-chain transaction
[67:33] I'm talking about in the future as well
[67:34] where the competition for Block Space is
[67:37] really competitive I mean right now
[67:38] there's not really any problem bitcoin's
[67:40] almost $100,000 and you can do a Bitcoin
[67:43] transaction for for a few tens of cents
[67:46] 50 cents something like that nothing um
[67:49] it's funny that the transactions only
[67:51] spiked transaction costs only spiked
[67:53] during the blocksize war and it there's
[67:55] a very good chance that the reason why
[67:57] it's spiked is that the people that
[67:59] wanted B blocks were deliberately
[68:01] spamming the Bitcoin blockchain with
[68:04] with uh frivolous transactions in order
[68:07] to boost their argument and and gather
[68:09] support for an increase in the block
[68:11] size all of those sorts of Tricks were
[68:14] waged unfortunately it was a but it pro
[68:17] but that but Bitcoin got through that it
[68:19] got through unchanged uncorrupted the
[68:21] corporate takeover failed and we've now
[68:24] got um
[68:26] Bitcoin is now it's resumed its dominant
[68:29] POS well it it never lost its dominant
[68:31] position but it came as close as it it
[68:36] hasn't it's it's dominance across the
[68:37] rest of the entire uh crypto um uh
[68:43] market cap space has only gone up since
[68:45] 2017 now that was the peak if you didn't
[68:49] managed to knock Bitcoin off its P off
[68:51] its perch back during the 2017
[68:56] and to sort of 2020 era where there was
[68:58] a lot of this stuff going on you're much
[69:01] less likely to do it now because these
[69:03] tax we saw because there were many
[69:05] attempts to sort of pump the price of
[69:07] the of the thing that was competing to
[69:09] be Bitcoin and it and it got weaker and
[69:11] weaker and weaker every time they did it
[69:13] and now it's virtually forgotten about I
[69:15] don't even I don't even mention its name
[69:17] now because why even why even give it
[69:20] the oxygen of
[69:22] publicity I I I just uh googly to check
[69:25] it like it it lost all its literally
[69:29] like uh and it's it's fascinating
[69:31] because in the beginning it actually uh
[69:34] uh went up uh like like 200 300% against
[69:40] uh Bitcoin and then it was like volatile
[69:43] for some period of time and since yeah I
[69:46] would say like October 2018 it just lost
[69:49] all the value and now it's like it's
[69:51] just a line at the bottom at that people
[69:53] there were some powerful people doing
[69:54] some big pumps on that in order to sort
[69:57] of lure people in and make them
[69:58] convinced and for there was one
[70:00] particular day there where jeez it did
[70:01] look like geez this look is this like it
[70:04] looked like they were really there was
[70:06] one I think when it was it it was I
[70:08] think it might have been 2018 sometime
[70:10] they were like it got to something like
[70:11] 30 or 40% of the value of Bitcoin and
[70:14] they were talking about a flipping I
[70:16] mean lots of things have tried to flip
[70:17] Bitcoin that was one etherum tried to
[70:19] flip Bitcoin where is it now Bitcoin is
[70:22] ethereum against Bitcoin is a fraction
[70:24] of what it was was back in 207 and I
[70:27] don't say this in a gloating way I say
[70:30] this in that I back then was trying to I
[70:33] always spent a lot of effort with these
[70:35] people trying to explain to them the the
[70:37] point of my point of view the point of
[70:39] view that it that turns out to have been
[70:41] right but unfortunately many of the
[70:44] people that I was discussing this with
[70:45] and and not just me many other people
[70:47] would have these conversations with
[70:48] online and wherever else they behaved in
[70:51] a very disingenuous way because you
[70:52] would go through all of their objections
[70:54] their things you you explain it all why
[70:57] and then the next week they would just
[70:59] come back with the same arguments that
[71:01] you had just told them what how you
[71:03] would just explained why they were wrong
[71:05] and they had accepted apparently and the
[71:07] next week they would come back and just
[71:08] start all over again and around and
[71:10] around it would go and eventually it got
[71:12] to the point where people that were sort
[71:14] of like would come into like the
[71:16] telegram groups and um meetups and
[71:19] things like that and they would start
[71:20] pushing this this big block line or the
[71:23] the line or all be in favor of
[71:25] alternative version of Bitcoin that um
[71:28] that attempted to flip it and they would
[71:30] they would be pushing the pushing the
[71:32] Nar The Narrative of of the um of the
[71:34] influences involved in that community
[71:36] and claiming it was the real Bitcoin and
[71:38] this sort of thing and eventually we we
[71:40] just had to sever atise with these but
[71:41] you can't it was just so disruptive
[71:43] because it's one thing I don't mind a
[71:44] good debate we all can enjoy a good
[71:46] exchange of ideas it can help us
[71:48] strengthen our own ideas and make sure
[71:51] our own position is um is airtight
[71:54] challenges no problem at all but when it
[71:56] just gets repeated like it's repetitive
[71:58] over and for years and years and years
[72:01] without any learning and know that any
[72:04] learning on the part of those people
[72:05] that you've been arguing against like
[72:07] it's just it you it's well you know now
[72:10] that you're not you're not talking with
[72:11] a you're not having an honest debate
[72:13] you're having you're talking with a
[72:14] disingenuous person that has a
[72:16] particular narrative to push or a or a
[72:19] bag to pump yeah I still sometimes get
[72:22] those comments and in the beginning
[72:23] actually like try to to argue uh now
[72:26] still like I'm just ignoring it I I
[72:29] treated those comments as the same as
[72:31] bot comments because it's like literally
[72:33] every week the same argument and it it
[72:36] never makes more sense and it's like
[72:38] it's and we're get now we're getting the
[72:40] same thing now with the with the xrp
[72:42] people the Ripple people are now the
[72:43] equivalent of those people that's the
[72:45] thing there always seems to be like one
[72:47] particularly I don't know it seems to
[72:49] like there's a particularly noisy group
[72:51] that I think perhaps there's a degree of
[72:54] um of farming there or sock puppet
[72:56] accounts I don't know I've no way of
[72:58] knowing that but it seems to be though
[73:00] every every cycle every now and again
[73:02] there's like a new um a new noisy
[73:05] annoying um you know group of people
[73:09] nipping it like little yapping Terriers
[73:12] nipping at the heels of Bitcoin you know
[73:15] um it's bad enough that you kind of got
[73:16] to fight the the Fiat system you know
[73:19] the Legacy system we're trying to get
[73:20] Bitcoin to catch on this idea it's you
[73:22] know of the of of the the whole the
[73:25] whole new monetary Revolution that
[73:27] Bitcoin brings but the fact that we also
[73:29] have to kind of fight this sort of rear
[73:31] guard action against people that sort of
[73:33] in some sense are then also claiming to
[73:36] be on our side that's the other
[73:38] confusing one they they their whole
[73:40] existence of their altcoin whatever it
[73:43] happens to be whether it's a Bitcoin
[73:45] failed Bitcoin fork or or a another
[73:48] centralized token of some kind um the
[73:52] whole existence of their currency
[73:55] whether they explicitly stated or not is
[73:57] predicated on the idea that there's some
[73:59] deficiency in Bitcoin there's some way
[74:01] in which Bitcoin is not good enough and
[74:04] so then they and then they turn around
[74:06] and have the frony to say that oh we're
[74:08] all on the same side they're funny that
[74:11] we're only on the same side when you
[74:12] guys are up against Regulators or
[74:14] something like that oh then we're on the
[74:16] same side but no I don't think we're on
[74:18] the same side at all I think those
[74:20] people are much more have much more in
[74:22] common with the Fiat system because what
[74:24] they're trying to do is create systems
[74:26] that put them back in the middle just as
[74:28] the the people that run the theat system
[74:30] in the middle um of something that they
[74:33] can sort of essentially clip the ticket
[74:34] on clip the ticket on everyone's
[74:36] transaction through their Network um
[74:39] with Bitcoin there is no one clipping
[74:40] the ticket there's no one in the middle
[74:43] um there's no one with really any more
[74:45] influence and control over the network
[74:46] than anybody else it is that neutral
[74:48] thing nothing else has that everything
[74:51] else is trying to just to sort of
[74:53] essentially import back back in the
[74:55] worst elements of the Fiat system that
[74:57] we're trying to get away from but just
[74:59] bring in like say a new group of people
[75:01] to do the same thing a group of nerds to
[75:03] centralize there doing it rather than a
[75:05] group of banksters I don't want anyone
[75:07] in the middle that was the whole reason
[75:08] why this was created I mean there was a
[75:11] a thing back a few weeks ago I think
[75:13] vitalic butan was uh complaining about
[75:16] the the attacks that he was
[75:19] getting uh on the over the Internet
[75:21] about certain proposals he had for how
[75:25] how Bitcoin would be certain governance
[75:26] proposals I think he um and the ethereum
[75:30] foundation had I mean if only there was
[75:32] this thing that was invented that
[75:34] obviated the need for Central planning
[75:36] committees and uh and centralized people
[75:39] that you could attack in the first place
[75:40] I mean you know good luck trying to
[75:42] attack Satoshi Nakamoto you know it's
[75:45] like that's the whole beauty of the guy
[75:47] disappearing good luck trying to attack
[75:49] you know um the people like there's the
[75:52] people like running B what you going
[75:54] attack 200 50,000 people running nodes
[75:58] they like to attack they do like to
[75:59] attack this sort of um nebulous uh group
[76:03] of people they describe as Bitcoin core
[76:06] they call them Bitcoin core um but of
[76:08] course Bitcoin core is just simply a
[76:11] Bitcoin client implementation that's a
[76:13] piece of software um what they're really
[76:16] talking about is core developers but of
[76:18] course if someone has a Bitcoin improve
[76:21] if anyone has a Bitcoin Improvement
[76:23] proposal then they're welcome to submit
[76:26] it and see if it cuts technical must
[76:29] with the rest of the Bitcoin I mean
[76:31] ultimately it's as as I go back to
[76:33] saying it's the 250,000 or whatever
[76:36] people it is running Bitcoin nodes that
[76:39] decides what Bitcoin is not some
[76:41] foundation and not some
[76:44] founder and and and I think uh people
[76:47] have people think the the the core
[76:50] developers of Bitcoin have more
[76:52] influence than they actually have like
[76:55] they not they're not deciding what's in
[76:57] the code it's the node Runners it's the
[76:59] whole network that decides that and not
[77:01] a few core developers that's right
[77:03] there's been plenty of proposals made by
[77:05] core developers that haven't seen the
[77:06] light of day because they wouldn't have
[77:08] been they wouldn't have been adopted by
[77:10] the the majority of people running nodes
[77:13] pretty simple absolutely yeah that's a
[77:16] that's a great uh a great way and a
[77:18] great P um I unfortunately have
[77:22] to make a point here uh but one more
[77:25] topic that I want to get in uh if you
[77:27] have the time uh to to get into that is
[77:30] um how that all will impact the world
[77:34] I'm really curious of like how a Bitcoin
[77:37] world looks like and that's I think
[77:39] probably the question ask most of of my
[77:42] 408 podcasts that I did now uh in in in
[77:46] in in the last like 14 months how what
[77:49] what impact Bitcoin will have eventually
[77:52] on the world uh and this is kind of the
[77:55] the most interesting for me well um I
[77:59] don't this you can sometime I think a
[78:01] lot of bitcoiners can sometimes be at
[78:02] risk of of sort of egging the pudding
[78:04] with a question like this like it you
[78:06] know it's all rainbows and unicorn farts
[78:08] and this sort of thing look I think that
[78:10] it will yield and result in a much more
[78:13] honest and transparent world one of the
[78:15] biggest the there's no I think greater
[78:20] in a way parasitic drag on Humanity than
[78:23] the idea of Central Banking
[78:25] um so much of the economic productivity
[78:28] of the world is essentially soaked up in
[78:32] the process of just running the
[78:35] financial system itself as well as the
[78:37] grift and the and and and and and the
[78:40] advantage given to people that are
[78:42] running and at the center of that and
[78:44] that on a Bitcoin standard all of the so
[78:47] many of these middleman middlemen just
[78:49] go away
[78:51] and so there's that there's also the
[78:53] idea that it could po yield a lower time
[78:57] preference world so a world in which
[78:59] people don't um because now savings
[79:03] because there's now an incentive to
[79:04] defer gratification again something that
[79:07] hasn't existed since our grandparents
[79:09] when you know grandparents used to tell
[79:11] you to save your money up in a money box
[79:13] that sort of thing if you'd been doing
[79:14] that for the past 30 years you were a
[79:16] sucker because like myself included for
[79:19] much of that because you know your money
[79:21] just went to like just got inflated away
[79:23] even if you were in Rel a country with a
[79:25] relatively stable um uh uh currency so
[79:30] it will lead to a lower time preference
[79:32] of people which means that people can
[79:33] look at doing things on a much more
[79:35] long-term basis even from the point of
[79:38] view of the environment if you're
[79:40] concerned about consumption and the use
[79:42] of the world's
[79:44] resources it it changes the ne it moves
[79:47] us away from the necessity of the
[79:50] current economic system for there to be
[79:53] continual economic growth grow our
[79:55] present Kian economic system in order to
[79:58] survive requires continuous economic
[80:01] growth every year otherwise it dies but
[80:03] how could you have continuous growth in
[80:06] a world of ultimately finite resources I
[80:09] mean on the one hand the very same
[80:11] people that the sort globalist type
[80:12] people that are in favor of all of that
[80:14] will tell you that you've got to cut
[80:15] back your
[80:16] consumption um it it whereas if you
[80:19] really wanted to get if you really
[80:21] wanted to align the incentives for
[80:23] people to not just cut back back there
[80:25] in consumption but prioritize only the
[80:29] more important consumption and the more
[80:31] sustainable consumption you would give
[80:33] them an incentive not to immediately
[80:36] spend all of their resources immed all
[80:38] the time you would give them the ability
[80:40] to say store in an immaterial thing if
[80:43] you store your value the work you've
[80:45] done your future um credits in the world
[80:49] in something that's immaterial you're
[80:51] not consuming that or taking it away
[80:53] from someone else who needs it for their
[80:54] their original use case so I used this
[80:56] example I used it um in fact last year
[80:59] at Bitcoin alive I used this example of
[81:02] houses here's a potentially good way I
[81:05] mean in Australia at the moment you
[81:06] might have heard of this idea we we have
[81:08] a housing crisis where um housing is
[81:11] incredibly expensive compared to uh
[81:13] weekly wages and part of the reason for
[81:16] that there are a number of reasons but
[81:18] one of the reasons for that is because a
[81:20] great many people use housing
[81:23] essentially as a store of the store of
[81:25] value because they see that by putting
[81:27] by storing their value as a house or as
[81:30] a piece of real estate its value at
[81:33] least it goes up at at least the rate at
[81:35] which the value of their dollar is is
[81:37] going back down so if you buy a house
[81:40] now in 20 years time you still at least
[81:42] have one house worth of uh purchasing
[81:45] power um locked up
[81:49] there
[81:50] however that Demand on real state is
[81:55] competing with the demand for someone
[81:57] who just wants to have a house to put a
[81:58] roof over their own head and and and
[82:00] that of their and and their family's
[82:02] heads so if now you could have something
[82:06] where by now I can put my money or the
[82:08] other thing is or if you put it in Gold
[82:10] you've got to spend enormous uh you've
[82:13] got to do quite a lot of environmental
[82:14] damage and other and you got to take
[82:16] gold even away from its industrial use
[82:18] cases like gold has actual industrial
[82:20] use cases Beyond jewelry and and just
[82:23] being but most gold is mined dug out out
[82:26] of the ground formed into bars and put
[82:28] back underground and um and expensively
[82:31] and guarded by guards that cost money to
[82:34] hire um which is pretty ridiculous when
[82:36] you think about it like that now what if
[82:38] you could have something with all of the
[82:39] same monetary properties but you didn't
[82:41] need to go through that whole charade
[82:43] you didn't and therefore gold well now
[82:45] would anything that actually you do need
[82:47] gold for electronics or whatever it
[82:49] happens to be now that could be cheaper
[82:52] because it's not competing with um
[82:55] people's youth it's not competing with
[82:57] the store of value use case anymore so
[83:00] all of these things it can actually make
[83:01] other resources so no one can therefore
[83:03] be ever accused of hoarding resources
[83:05] anymore all you're going to do is hoard
[83:07] this immaterial thing called Bitcoin
[83:09] knowing that it will carry the value
[83:12] indefinitely into the future so that
[83:15] then when you really do need gold or
[83:17] real estate or any other thing that you
[83:19] might have otherwise had to hoard at the
[83:20] expense of those that really need it now
[83:23] um you'll be able to get it a great
[83:24] point of like this this hoarding
[83:26] completely being uh washed away because
[83:29] people don't use anything else except
[83:31] Bitcoin as a store of value I mean
[83:35] probably people will still like maybe
[83:37] have Collectibles and like there will be
[83:39] markets for for things but like in
[83:41] general uh they will not misuse like
[83:44] things like houses in Austria
[83:46] also very popular you can see behind me
[83:48] here but I don't collect those with any
[83:49] idea that I'm going to cash them in I
[83:51] just collect those things because I'm
[83:52] interested in them and I like them and I
[83:54] think that's what most people with a lot
[83:56] of people with Collectibles that's what
[83:57] it should be all about but there are of
[83:59] course people who do use those things as
[84:02] stores of value and I can tell you that
[84:04] it turns out to be a pretty bad way of
[84:06] storing value like because the trends
[84:08] you got to be on top of collecting
[84:09] Trends and you know um and a lot of
[84:12] Collectibles tend to move with the
[84:15] generations of people that had an
[84:17] affinity for that sort of thing so you
[84:19] know if you take the example of people
[84:20] that used to collect Elvis memorabilia a
[84:23] lot of people there was a lot lot of
[84:24] Elvis type memorabilia around that the
[84:27] Boomers you know accumulated in in vast
[84:31] quantities but as soon as those Estates
[84:33] and as soon as those people began to die
[84:35] off and downsize um then all of those
[84:38] Collectibles flooded the market so
[84:40] Collectibles can be and it's and it's
[84:42] happened also in I mean I never bought
[84:44] those radios with the intention of like
[84:46] storing value in them usually just buy
[84:48] them as run down wrecks and restore them
[84:51] and that sort of thing but a lot of
[84:52] people though years ago 15 20 years ago
[84:55] well before I got into it um thought
[84:57] that they could buy some valuable radius
[84:59] some of them could be worth many
[85:00] thousands of dollars each and it turned
[85:03] out that those things really didn't hold
[85:05] their value because they were because
[85:07] they collecting Trends changed you don't
[85:10] have any of those problems with Bitcoin
[85:12] because there can only be one again
[85:15] immaculately conceived first
[85:17] instantiation of digital scarcity
[85:20] everything else is a copy which can be
[85:21] infinitely copied and therefore will
[85:23] have no value
[85:24] um Bitcoin there's no reason to believe
[85:27] that Bitcoin won't be continuing there
[85:30] will not be Bitcoin being there will not
[85:33] be blocks being produced a thousand
[85:35] years from now there's nothing to
[85:37] prevent that in fact in all probability
[85:39] there will be Bitcoin blocks mind
[85:42] thousands of years from now providing us
[85:43] if there's Humanity if if we if there's
[85:46] still a functioning
[85:48] civilization uh there's no reason to
[85:50] believe that Bitcoin blocks will not be
[85:52] still being mined in
[85:55] Millennia hence yeah and everything else
[85:58] uh will then be investing again like if
[86:01] you have like if you want to invest in
[86:03] like watches or like radios or some
[86:06] other Collectibles you have to stay on
[86:08] top of your game to like do it
[86:10] productive things like you'd invest in
[86:12] you you you you would buy things like
[86:13] that because you you're interested in
[86:15] them like that would be I consider those
[86:17] to be one of the ends of money not the
[86:18] money in itself like money is a means to
[86:20] an end and maybe if you've got enough of
[86:22] it um you might decide you like certain
[86:25] things you have an interest in them well
[86:26] the money is there to to buy those
[86:28] things with that's all that is um rather
[86:30] than it being looked at rather than
[86:33] using the collectible as a as a as yet
[86:35] another means to another end which is to
[86:38] for it to presumably be worth more in
[86:39] the future people will still speculate
[86:41] on things I'm sure um and people will
[86:44] also make productive Investments like
[86:46] for example they are going to need to be
[86:48] I think there was the idea that you know
[86:50] people will still need to invest in
[86:52] things to be built like a build like a
[86:54] new uh if someone needs to build a hotel
[86:56] that's going to require investors and
[86:58] therefore the investor will have to give
[87:00] up some potential upside in Bitcoin in
[87:02] order to have it um go into the
[87:05] investment instead and at some
[87:07] point even in a hyperbitcoinization
[87:24] coin standard it will make sense because
[87:26] there will be things that you can judge
[87:28] will make you more Bitcoin than what
[87:31] you'd
[87:32] invested that's a great Point yeah uh
[87:35] really cool I have one question that I
[87:36] ask each and every one of my guests and
[87:38] the question is what can we learn from
[87:39] you besides Bitcoin what can we learn
[87:41] from me besides Bitcoin oh you caught me
[87:44] off guard there I suppose
[87:46] um well I suppose another interest of
[87:49] mine is uh I've just mentioned the the
[87:51] vintage electronics behind me vintage um
[87:54] radio and that sort of thing um I've
[87:56] also been involved in a bit of astronomy
[87:58] I I built a was part involved in
[88:01] building one in fact I did most of the
[88:02] rig up for it was a remote controlled
[88:05] astronomical Observatory um so the idea
[88:08] was is we had a um uh The Observatory
[88:11] was set an observatory for looking at
[88:13] the stars just so people understand what
[88:14] I'm talking about there it was a dome
[88:17] with a 12in telescope and connected to a
[88:20] computer and um so I've uh I've learned
[88:23] a fair bit
[88:24] about astronomy and ended up having to a
[88:26] few times give talks on uh on on
[88:29] astronomy and use that remote control
[88:31] Observatory to demonstrate um uh much
[88:35] well Astro Concepts in astronomy as well
[88:37] as how um how telescopes and how how
[88:42] that whole system works um that uh that
[88:47] uh was something that I haven't been
[88:49] doing a lot with the last couple of
[88:50] years Co interrupted that but um the
[88:52] people I was working with on are very
[88:54] keen for me to get back involved and get
[88:55] that going for them again this year so
[88:57] um maybe if it's all going up again at
[89:00] the end of the year I might uh I might
[89:02] do a remote demo of um o of that
[89:05] Observatory from here and we can control
[89:07] that Observatory um in the far north
[89:10] which is located in Far North Queensland
[89:11] so I'm in Sydney The Observatory is in
[89:13] Far North Queensland but maybe my maybe
[89:16] my audience is in
[89:17] Brisbane and you know we can do a we can
[89:20] say to the people what do you want to
[89:22] look at tonight providing it's obviously
[89:23] in our in our Hemisphere and we can uh
[89:27] we can run the telescope on the screen
[89:29] and you can see everything you can see
[89:30] cameras see what it's doing and um and
[89:33] and explain how uh how all of that works
[89:35] and um and have an astronomy night so
[89:39] that's the that's the that's the that's
[89:40] just one example I've come up with on
[89:42] the top of my head there I hope that
[89:43] answers the question I love I love that
[89:46] yeah it's it's super interesting to get
[89:48] uh the bitcoiners that you you you
[89:50] usually know and they always talk about
[89:51] Bitcoin to get some small out other
[89:54] thing of D see like what other interests
[89:56] are there I think it's also important
[89:59] for for bitcoiners to develop interests
[90:01] uh above being just a bitcoiner because
[90:04] Bitcoin if it's successful it will be
[90:07] just money and at some point it will be
[90:09] very boring to talk about Bitcoin
[90:11] because it's like what's interesting
[90:13] about both of those things that the
[90:14] astronomy I mentioned and building that
[90:16] Observatory and Bitcoin is that both of
[90:17] those things required me to sort of
[90:20] self-learn a whole lot of like like
[90:23] spread of different disciplines like I'm
[90:25] not going to claim that I'm like a deep
[90:26] expert on any of those disciplines no
[90:28] I'm not but but I had to learn enough
[90:30] about it in order to make the thing work
[90:32] and you know and it was very interesting
[90:34] from that point of view because even it
[90:36] covered everything from learning about
[90:38] Optics to learning about just doing some
[90:40] even just doing some basic metal work in
[90:42] carpentry doing Electronics computers um
[90:45] obviously the astronomy itself um
[90:48] geometry um there were just so many
[90:50] fields that I had to cover in order to
[90:52] make that thing work and Bitcoin is kind
[90:53] of similar in order to sort of get an
[90:56] understand it and really believe in it
[90:58] you kind of had you kind of had to get
[91:00] across quite a few different quite a few
[91:02] different disciplines um you know the
[91:04] game game theory economics to some
[91:06] extent computers although not nearly as
[91:09] much as people think um because after
[91:11] all Bitcoin is not primarily I might
[91:13] want to make this point as well is
[91:15] because this is the point a lot of
[91:16] people make Bitcoin is not primarily a
[91:18] tech phenomenon it's a monetary
[91:20] phenomenon the tech is just in service
[91:23] of it as a monetary phenomenon whereas
[91:26] in the mistake that the blockchain is
[91:29] and the smart contract people make is
[91:31] they they think of all of this is Tech
[91:32] and they look at well my my chain can do
[91:35] more things than Bitcoin can do
[91:37] therefore it's better because it can do
[91:39] all that add all of these bells and
[91:40] whistles um because they're looking at
[91:42] as a tech thing and then and then they
[91:45] want people to buy the token as well and
[91:48] what it is is that the token um is
[91:51] really just supporting the network
[91:53] rather than in this case it's um rather
[91:57] than in bitcoin's case it is the it is
[91:58] the money it's the it's the BTC itself
[92:01] that's everything and the network is
[92:03] merely just a means for making the bit
[92:06] like the Bitcoin is in the money that we
[92:08] hold in Bitcoin work so it's a total
[92:10] inversion that way and it's uh so it's
[92:12] very important to think not to think in
[92:14] Tech terms of Bitcoin and and and and
[92:17] these other things but in in in monetary
[92:20] and economic terms I I usually have the
[92:23] most um
[92:24] um success with normies that compare
[92:28] Bitcoin to MasterCard and Bitcoin to
[92:29] Facebook I usually tell them there's a
[92:32] difference between protocol level and
[92:34] product level uh and those they they
[92:38] they usually tend to understand that
[92:40] like if you compare Bitcoin to a tcpip
[92:43] protocol versus Bitcoin to Facebook like
[92:47] Bitcoin is a protocol and uh uh and
[92:51] wallet or an exchange or something like
[92:53] that that that that would be compar uh
[92:56] comparable to Facebook and and product
[92:58] on top of that yes that's absolutely
[93:00] right I mean that's what people have for
[93:02] the whole time the whole time I've been
[93:03] involved bit have been making that false
[93:05] equivalence between that well they used
[93:07] to say well Bitcoin is my space and
[93:10] ethereum is like well Facebook or you
[93:13] know they you've heard that one
[93:14] obviously you know um whereas it's a
[93:16] complet that's very frustrating one yeah
[93:19] it's a completely false equivalence born
[93:21] out of that misunderstanding and looking
[93:23] at Bitcoin primarily as a tech
[93:25] phenomenon rather than a once in
[93:27] Millennium uh uh paradigm shift in the
[93:31] nature of money absolutely it's it's
[93:33] super interesting um I could I think
[93:36] talk two more hours with you it's it's
[93:38] super interesting I I I can see that
[93:40] there's a years and years of knowledge
[93:43] of p in your brain that we could chest
[93:46] for like tens of hours um we have an
[93:48] entertain in the podcast where the
[93:49] previous guest is asking a question for
[93:51] the next guest without knowing who the
[93:53] next guest is and this is now actually
[93:54] the the last question of today um what
[93:57] does the world and this the question
[93:59] from a previous guest to you what does
[94:01] the world look like in 2030 so in
[94:03] basically four five years uh I suggested
[94:07] it would look very very similar to what
[94:09] the world looks like now I know this is
[94:10] not a very exciting answer but um one of
[94:13] the tendencies that people when they've
[94:15] tried to predict the future is they've
[94:16] always tried to bring the the future too
[94:19] much we see this in sci-fi all the time
[94:21] they try to bring the future far too
[94:23] close and either they interpret the
[94:25] future using the the design language of
[94:28] the present day and so you've got this
[94:30] sort of like you get that's why you get
[94:31] this sort of retrofuturism kind of look
[94:35] and then they sort of O like they sort
[94:36] of um underestimate how long it will
[94:38] take for certain new technologies to
[94:40] come about so for example they'll
[94:42] they'll say that um well we'll have
[94:44] faster than light transport and T and
[94:47] teleporters or flying cars by you know
[94:50] by the year 2050 or something or by or
[94:53] the they predicted it by the year 2000
[94:55] let's say but then all of the styling of
[94:57] the 2000 era looks like the 1950s but
[95:00] with flying cars you know what I mean so
[95:02] um but we've always got this tendency to
[95:05] say it's to so I would say it's going to
[95:06] look pretty much the same as it looks
[95:08] now um you know maybe um obviously
[95:11] Bitcoin will be a bit more valuable so
[95:13] those it might look a lot different to
[95:15] those that are holding Bitcoin in terms
[95:16] of their own personal life but um I
[95:19] doubt it would look much different from
[95:21] looking at say a Google street view map
[95:23] of um 2020 than looking at a or 2018
[95:26] let's say and a and a 2014 sorry 2024 um
[95:31] Google Street View image it's a very
[95:33] true answer yeah like people
[95:36] underestimate um like people
[95:38] overestimate what's coming in like the
[95:40] next one to five years but they
[95:42] underestimate what it's possible like in
[95:43] 20 30 30 years like the the the the
[95:47] long-term uh things of that yeah like
[95:49] five years is especially on a global
[95:52] scale you can May zoom in and like on AI
[95:55] Trend like AI maybe has in the next five
[95:58] years an excitement exciting uh uh a
[96:01] future ahead but maybe also not um but
[96:05] that that's very true of like the the
[96:06] global
[96:07] world the question is asked so broadly
[96:10] what does the world look like in 2030
[96:12] mostly the same as 2025 boring answer I
[96:15] know um however I'm I'm I don't want to
[96:18] get political in your podcast but there
[96:19] could be some major movements in terms
[96:22] of I do think that perap for many years
[96:24] uh the previous administrations in the
[96:27] United States again the largest and only
[96:30] power world superpower at the moment
[96:32] kind of considered the decline of the
[96:33] United States as being an inevitability
[96:35] that we should just manage and allow
[96:38] then sort of other Eastern Nations China
[96:40] and India and so forth would become
[96:42] ascendant um whereas things could well
[96:46] now be very different in terms of the
[96:48] way that goes because certainly the
[96:49] current Administration does not consider
[96:51] it to be in inevitability the West just
[96:54] declines and Fizzles away and that we
[96:56] should give up all hopes of striving and
[96:58] improving and um and uh doing the best
[97:02] we can and um it's uh there's there's
[97:05] cause to think that perhaps now that
[97:07] that that that that pendulum is uh
[97:09] swinging back um in a more sensible
[97:12] Direction but I don't want to get too
[97:13] political it's not necessarily where
[97:15] your all your um listeners May
[97:17] necessarily be at so uh want to keep it
[97:19] as broad broadly appealing for people as
[97:21] possible but um I don't you're going to
[97:24] make me on the spot come up with a
[97:26] question for the next listener are you
[97:27] the next um I I I usually give people
[97:30] some some time to think about that uh
[97:32] like I usually collect like in 99% of
[97:36] the cases I collect the the question
[97:38] after we record it uh so but sometimes
[97:41] the guest brings it up and then uh
[97:43] sometimes we we directly make the
[97:45] question uh but it actually it's funny
[97:47] that you came to the political topic
[97:49] because the previous guest was actually
[97:50] a mayor uh of a small town in America
[97:54] it's funny because he he you always ask
[97:57] the that's why he asked the question he
[97:59] always asked the citizens when he
[98:02] encounters them in like some group
[98:03] setting or something like that oh like
[98:05] how do you want the town to look like in
[98:07] five years like what can I do for you in
[98:09] the next five years because like four
[98:11] five six years is usually like the the
[98:13] election cycle and this is usually like
[98:15] like politician it's the time frame of a
[98:18] politician usually like five years
[98:20] that's true that's the problem with it
[98:21] isn't it it's um there no again no
[98:24] long-term thinking there it's only a
[98:26] matter of getting through to the next
[98:27] election which is why um in this case
[98:31] though one of the things about the US
[98:32] system is that again the current
[98:34] president cannot run for another turn so
[98:38] all he really is concerned with is his
[98:40] legacy and possibly you know proving his
[98:43] hate is wrong um there's one thing that
[98:47] at least you know you can say what you
[98:48] like about the man's ego but there's one
[98:50] thing it's going to show that that ego
[98:53] is going to to make sure that he doesn't
[98:54] that that he does a good job you know he
[98:57] doesn't want to be remembered as a fail
[98:59] president he doesn't want to be
[99:00] remembered as a guy who didn't follow
[99:02] through on the things he was going to do
[99:04] um I think broadly speaking most
[99:06] bitcoiners have been pretty impressed by
[99:08] um the speed of the of the of the
[99:10] promises being kept Ross um released
[99:14] okay day two well fine day one day two
[99:16] who cares like um we're yet to sort of
[99:20] see how the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve
[99:24] uh might materialize a little
[99:25] disappointed about the um about the
[99:27] shitcoin about the the Trump coin but
[99:30] you know it makes like it seems there
[99:32] was a trump coin a Melania coin the same
[99:33] mob was even behind this um Libra coin
[99:36] with um ja in uh and so there's that was
[99:40] that was disappointing I think a lot of
[99:42] bitcoiners you know no matter just
[99:44] because you know you might have been
[99:45] otherwise supportive of other things
[99:47] doesn't mean you have to support the
[99:48] whole thing perhaps there were people
[99:50] perhaps he was Ill advised I mean after
[99:52] all so many of the people that are
[99:55] bitcoiners now themselves will readily
[99:57] admit to have having gone through a
[99:59] shitcoin
[100:00] phase um I'm prepared to believe that
[100:02] Trump's understanding of what he's
[100:04] really getting into isn't that deep yet
[100:06] I don't really think he's have any
[100:08] really deep knowledge I think he's again
[100:11] understands that there is a that there
[100:13] is a significant constituency there that
[100:16] is worthwhile keeping
[100:18] happy and I think as well he also has a
[100:22] great deal more personally experience
[100:24] with what can happen to people with
[100:26] under centralized systems he himself
[100:29] after 2020 they used that January 6
[100:32] business as a pretext for it was almost
[100:34] threatened with having his own bank
[100:36] account shut down I mean they already
[100:38] kicked him they shut down all of his
[100:40] social media all of that and was very
[100:42] close to I think losing a lot of his own
[100:44] like ability to to operate in financial
[100:48] institutions that I think would have
[100:49] been a very eye openening thing and he
[100:51] would have realized that he possibly at
[100:52] least realizes that such
[100:55] persecution such whether of of powers
[100:59] that be towards their political enemies
[101:01] are just not possible on a Bitcoin
[101:03] standard so that could have been will
[101:05] have been a sort of damine Road
[101:08] conversion for him um because of course
[101:11] during his for first ter um Trump was
[101:15] very much you know made some tweets that
[101:17] were very anti- Bitcoin but there were
[101:20] really no more anti- Bitcoin than um
[101:23] than the sorts of comments that many
[101:25] people made about Bitcoin before they've
[101:26] learned anything about it so to me I'm
[101:29] just sort of watching The Evolution of
[101:30] somebody who's sort of started off as a
[101:31] nocoiner spoken out against it didn't
[101:34] like it then kind of Lyn had maybe a
[101:36] personal Epiphany with their own bad
[101:39] experience with uh the Legacy system
[101:42] woken up an Awakening moment perhaps and
[101:45] then sort of gone into the C of [ __ ]
[101:48] coining phase that the [ __ ] coining
[101:49] phase of course doesn't preclude Bitcoin
[101:52] it just means you buy Bitcoin and you
[101:53] also get into crypto and shitcoins and
[101:56] block and all of that as well until
[101:58] eventually then getting to the point
[102:00] where you realize ah okay I should have
[102:02] just been in Bitcoin and all of that
[102:04] other thing was sort of noise and
[102:05] distraction so yeah I mean um very
[102:09] interested to see how that uh how that
[102:12] progresses yeah
[102:14] we we can have we can let them have some
[102:18] uh learning curve I think that it's um
[102:22] it's obviously disappointing that he
[102:23] does the [ __ ] coining and that we we
[102:26] still don't have strategic Bitcoin
[102:28] Reserve but honestly I I I rather don't
[102:31] have a strategic Bitcoin Reserve I know
[102:33] like a lot of bitcoiners like that idea
[102:35] a lot but I rather have more years for
[102:40] PL St and for myself also uh to buy buy
[102:43] my Bitcoin maybe that's like an
[102:45] egoistical
[102:47] statement I mean it would be look it
[102:50] would be nice for those that are already
[102:52] got to the point where they feel that
[102:53] they like we talked about at the
[102:55] beginning of the podcast those that sort
[102:57] of looking towards retirement yeah
[102:58] they'd like to have their bags pumped
[103:00] one big time you know before they could
[103:02] decide to yeah before taking a little
[103:04] bit of Bitcoin out and doing some things
[103:06] they want to do um but uh uh you know
[103:09] that's not owed to them it's not owed to
[103:11] any of us and Bitcoin itself doesn't
[103:13] depend on it um but it would probably be
[103:16] in the national interests to hold
[103:18] something like that if you were going to
[103:20] hold countries have held gold and
[103:22] they've held the you know assets of
[103:24] other countries there's no reason why
[103:26] for the good of if you're just looking
[103:27] at the good of the country whereas it
[103:28] shouldn't keep its own Sovereign a
[103:31] certain percentage of his own Sovereign
[103:32] wealth in Bitcoin because I said the
[103:34] game theory lines up just as well for
[103:36] countries as it lines up for individuals
[103:39] so that may well be the inevitable
[103:41] fiscally
[103:42] responsible uh line that they've got to
[103:44] go down Trump sa far though only have a
[103:46] promised not to sell any of the Bitcoin
[103:49] that they already had which was I think
[103:51] mostly seized Bitcoin from Silk Road and
[103:54] perhaps a few other um matters but um
[103:58] States though individually though have
[104:00] prly got legislation all over the United
[104:02] States legislation pending or at least
[104:04] looking to be voted upon about
[104:06] establishing their own Bitcoin Reserve
[104:09] separately to that so we'll see what
[104:11] happens
[104:12] there absolutely one small uh F fun fact
[104:16] because you said like Trump got attacked
[104:17] and also got kicked out of social media
[104:20] also not only banks but also social
[104:21] media um he recently that's so funny how
[104:26] this is full circle uh he recently got
[104:28] $10 million from Twitter uh for
[104:32] basically from El musk uh from the
[104:34] lawsuit discount I
[104:37] he
[104:39] yeah so so that it's funny how now
[104:43] Twitter who uh is owned b musk and he
[104:45] reinstated Twitter and got it a little
[104:47] bit more free speech focused not perfect
[104:50] but way more than it was before uh and
[104:53] and now Trump actually got uh money back
[104:56] from that from that current Twitter and
[104:59] also El musk is a huge Don on that drum
[105:03] is is an interesting
[105:04] relationship yeah I think the $10
[105:06] million was sort of like a token thing
[105:08] apparently I think what they were
[105:09] looking for originally was much much
[105:10] higher and I suspect I think it was
[105:13] ended up just being essentially look the
[105:15] money was going to to be donated to the
[105:17] Trump Presidential Library at the end of
[105:19] the day that's pocket change for Elon
[105:20] Elon would have just thought yeah just
[105:22] he just left it to the lawers and say
[105:23] settle it and Trump's agreed I think
[105:25] under the circumstances of especially
[105:28] getting given how well he and Elon Musk
[105:30] are getting on um to sort of settle it
[105:33] for what people at that level is
[105:35] considered a fairly trivial amount and
[105:38] it's I said to look at it as a donation
[105:39] to the Presidential Library it's not
[105:41] worth um because of course what the
[105:43] media have been trying to do since day
[105:45] one is essentially cause a rift between
[105:47] the two drive a wedge between Elon Musk
[105:50] and Trump trying to say that Elon is
[105:52] assuring the president Y and stealing
[105:55] Donald's Thunder and trying to sort of
[105:57] needle in ways that they think that will
[105:59] you know really dig at Trump so you go
[106:01] and it's of course they're a wake up to
[106:03] it they can see it they're laughing at
[106:05] it it's not going to work um yeah like
[106:08] that Trump is smart than that he doesn't
[106:10] see that especially because like the the
[106:12] mainstream media he's not on their side
[106:14] but yeah thank you so much um JP for
[106:18] being on like we we we we almost hit the
[106:21] two hour marks I think
[106:23] it's probably the I think the second or
[106:26] the third longest podcast I've I've done
[106:28] usually I try to like get it to under
[106:30] one and a half hours sometimes it's
[106:31] unavoidable to run longer maybe some of
[106:34] it in the editing room I don't
[106:37] know so thank you so much J for being uh
[106:41] before I let you go uh we can be find
[106:43] you ask your questions reach out to you
[106:45] and and yeah find we didn't talk much

[107:26] Bush bashes um that we have in Australia
[107:29] so with there's the so on top of the
[107:31] monthly meetups that I run in Sydney
[107:32] we've got the um there are now four Bush
[107:35] Bashers a year where they're lack a
[107:36] Meetup but they go for a whole weekend
[107:38] and people from Bitcoin is from all
[107:39] around Australia and occasionally from
[107:41] outside Australia uh meet and gather to
[107:44] share uh to share speaking topics that
[107:46] we you we give talks um have dinners
[107:50] lunches all the sort of things so
[107:51] they're like a cross between a sort of
[107:53] like a kind of like an informal
[107:55] conference um that goes over sort of two
[107:57] and a half days and there's four of
[107:58] those one in West Australia one in
[108:00] Victoria one in New South Wales one in
[108:02] Queensland and so last year and now this
[108:05] year I'll be running with my Bitcoin
[108:06] Sydney um uh assistance as well running
[108:10] the New South Wales Bush bash in Parks
[108:12] so that bush bash will be on in at the
[108:15] end of November the final uh weekend of
[108:18] November there is another Bush bash
