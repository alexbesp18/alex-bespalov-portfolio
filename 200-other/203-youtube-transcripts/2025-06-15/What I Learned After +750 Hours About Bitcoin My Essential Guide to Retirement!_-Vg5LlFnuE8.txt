[00:00] Don't be bothered if you say like, "Oh,
[00:02] I only have 0.01 Bitcoin." We we have
[00:05] all seen those tweets where someone
[00:07] said, "I only have 8,000 Bitcoin. I'm
[00:10] selling tomorrow because I will never
[00:13] have a good amount of Bitcoin." And he
[00:15] has 8,000 Bitcoin. The age only matters
[00:18] if you look for Bitcoin in retirement.
[00:21] So, if you say like, "Oh, I want to
[00:22] retire on Bitcoin." Then the age really
[00:25] matters. I don't want to deal with the
[00:27] fiat system. I just want to stack my
[00:29] Bitcoin and keep seeing my stack growing
[00:33] slowly, organically, and humbly every
[00:35] month a little bit. Most people only
[00:38] care about number technology and only a
[00:41] very few handful of people truly with
[00:44] their action and with their words care
[00:46] about the freedom co-op technology
[00:49] around Bitcoin. I do think that Bitcoin
[00:53] impact our relationships
[00:57] [Music]
[00:59] This is a completely new format where I
[01:03] try to share not only the opinions and
[01:05] the uh the takes from other guests but
[01:08] also my own opinion and my own takes. So
[01:11] the first step in my my trying to do
[01:14] that is I will post podcast appearances
[01:18] that I do in other podcasts right here
[01:20] on my channel too. Maybe some uh parts
[01:23] are cut, maybe it is a little bit
[01:24] different. So it will be maybe a little
[01:27] bit different from the original just to
[01:29] make it clean and just to make it uh
[01:31] ensure the quality of of my podcast. But
[01:34] I will do that and I will also start in
[01:36] the future to do solo episodes and share
[01:39] my learnings that I have done I've got
[01:41] from now almost approaching 500
[01:44] different guests. That has been amazing
[01:46] to have so many different guests and so
[01:49] many different brains speak into my
[01:52] brain. And this brain accumulation in in
[01:56] my own brain uh allowed me to deepen my
[01:59] knowledge uh around Bitcoin and have
[02:02] some really interesting insights and
[02:04] conclusions from that. So, I will I I
[02:06] want to share that more and more with
[02:08] you, especially as there's a lot of
[02:10] people that might not watch every
[02:14] episode of mine, but are interested in
[02:16] what what I've learned or what are the
[02:18] learnings from the podcast. So, I want
[02:19] to provide the learnings and the uh
[02:23] insights from this podcast in more
[02:26] condensed sizes. I will write a book. I
[02:28] will write articles. I will share more
[02:30] on Twitter. I will also share solo
[02:33] episodes from one specific topic.
[02:35] Shorter videos, longer videos, whatever
[02:37] it takes. I want to uh teach uh here
[02:40] about Bitcoin. I want to bring uh the
[02:43] most interesting conclusions and the
[02:45] most interesting insights also to this
[02:47] channel. Uh but mostly it will stay an
[02:51] interview podcast where I interview
[02:54] other people. Mostly 90% I want to learn
[02:59] from other people and 10% maybe I want
[03:02] to teach. Um this might change in a year
[03:05] this might change in two years where the
[03:07] percentage gets uh gets a little bit
[03:09] different but I will I will I always
[03:12] want to focus on learning first and
[03:15] teaching second. learning is always the
[03:18] the most important part uh I think in in
[03:20] someone's one's life. So, thank you so
[03:23] much for being on that learning journey
[03:24] with me together. And uh yeah uh and
[03:28] with that out of the way, this is a
[03:30] podcast uh where Gary actually
[03:33] interviewed me on his new podcast and uh
[03:36] I asked him if I can share this with you
[03:38] guys also and he said yes. So I the
[03:41] following is a conversation where Gary
[03:44] interviewed me and I shared uh personal
[03:47] stuff. I shared my Bitcoin opinions and
[03:48] I shared right in the end uh some some
[03:51] very interesting take on um Bitcoin and
[03:55] relationships and how what a feared
[03:57] relationship is and what a Bitcoin
[03:58] relationship is and how how this works
[04:00] is and and yes we're talking about
[04:02] romantic relationships even sex in the
[04:04] end of the podcast. Uh, so this was a
[04:06] lot of fun and I found it so valuable
[04:09] that I wanted to share it with you. So
[04:11] enjoy. Thanks so much for agreeing to be
[04:13] on my podcast. I'm I'm flattered and
[04:15] honored. Yeah, it's it's really cool to
[04:18] be on other on the other side. I've done
[04:20] it I think 30 times now, somewhere
[04:22] around those range and I have done it
[04:24] over 400 times on the host side. So I I
[04:27] I do feel more comfortable being the
[04:29] host and and knowing where the direction
[04:31] of the conversation goes. But it's
[04:32] actually really cool to sharpen your own
[04:34] knife and and see where questions end up
[04:38] and where things go because I don't want
[04:40] to know the the questions beforehand.
[04:42] And I think it's uh it's it's good and
[04:44] it's it's like more on the spontaneous
[04:46] side of of of my brain and not like I
[04:48] know with that guess and I want to go in
[04:49] that direction. Well, you were honestly
[04:52] one of the um the reasons that I've
[04:55] started this one really because I've
[04:56] enjoyed listening to your podcast and I
[04:58] like the kind of natural style that you
[05:01] talk to your guests and your inquisitive
[05:03] approach. So hopefully if I can be half
[05:06] as good as you, I'll be a be a pretty
[05:09] good uh host, I think. So yeah, let's uh
[05:12] let's see how we go. Thank you so much.
[05:15] Where I like to start usually with my
[05:16] guests is just to go as far back as you
[05:19] can remember really into your first
[05:21] memories of money. There is an
[05:22] interesting um I I told that before but
[05:25] I think it's it's really interesting and
[05:27] it speaks to how how I might was able to
[05:30] get into Bitcoin so early. I was uh
[05:32] probably like 10 years old, 12 years old
[05:35] at the time where you go already to
[05:37] school and buy at at lunch your own own
[05:40] small things and you get some pocket
[05:41] money from from your kid. Uh and uh this
[05:44] was the the real first
[05:47] um time where I actually got money uh
[05:50] because I was in school. So uh Robin,
[05:53] I'm in school and uh I got into lunch
[05:56] with my friends and you get like four or
[05:58] five from your parents. Um, and then you
[06:02] go to the the supermarket. And when I
[06:04] was at the supermarket, uh, I I picked
[06:07] out like one two items, but I never
[06:09] really uh wanted to spend all my money.
[06:12] So, I wanted to spend uh only only like
[06:15] 2 three from that to save one or two.
[06:18] So, so this is something that I did all
[06:21] the time. Even when I was a young boy, I
[06:25] took what I got and saved a little bit
[06:28] from it. Um, this is something that
[06:31] really stuck in my mind and and I I can
[06:33] I can still see it in my head where uh
[06:37] one day my mom went to the same
[06:39] supermarket I was with my with my uh my
[06:43] friends and my mom actually felt bad for
[06:45] me because I didn't I was like so almost
[06:48] greedy and I didn't want to spend my
[06:49] money. So she's like, "You have another
[06:52] five and and buy yourself something."
[06:54] Because she saw what the other kids
[06:56] bought uh and that I bought like only
[06:59] small things because I knew when I come
[07:01] home there's a fridge full of food. Uh I
[07:04] I don't have to pay for that, but I have
[07:05] to pay in the supermarket with my money
[07:07] that my mom gave me. So
[07:10] uh ever since I got money I was always a
[07:14] very saving personality and that's how I
[07:17] also ended up investing from 18 years
[07:20] old. 18 years old was the age where it
[07:24] was first time legal to open like
[07:26] investing accounts and stuff like that
[07:28] on my own without my parents. And this
[07:30] is where I just started then also
[07:32] because I had money left over and I
[07:33] didn't wanted to spend it on on anything
[07:35] because everything I needed I had with
[07:38] my parents at the home and so I was like
[07:40] why why do I spend? Yeah. Did you do you
[07:42] think you got that approach to money
[07:45] from your parents? Were they did they
[07:46] give that same kind of did they give
[07:48] that advice to you when you were young
[07:50] or did you observe that in the way that
[07:52] they uh spent their money and saved or
[07:55] was it something more inherent?
[07:58] That's actually something I never talked
[07:59] about even on my podcast. My dad founded
[08:03] a company and now it was uh in the
[08:05] mid-range successful. He didn't sell it
[08:08] for millions but he sold out of it and
[08:10] and he made some some money with that.
[08:12] But in the beginning stages of a company
[08:14] it's frightening. Uh you don't have a
[08:16] lot of money. You put a lot a lot of
[08:18] money on the line. It was the same time
[08:20] also they just bought the house. Oh, and
[08:22] this is the same time I was also like 2
[08:24] years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years also
[08:26] like it was really early. Uh, and in
[08:29] hindsight, I think that really
[08:32] influenced me of being more saving
[08:34] because my dad saved whatever he could
[08:37] on on everything. And and this is
[08:39] actually showing even now and even now
[08:42] where uh he made money and and he can
[08:46] live comfortably and he didn't had to
[08:48] save.
[08:49] uh even when he now has money uh he
[08:52] tries to save everywhere. For example,
[08:54] we had a we have a pool in in our home
[08:57] and he only uses the electricity on the
[08:59] pool uh to to to fill it up and again
[09:02] stuff like that in like 2 in the morning
[09:04] because there the electricity is the
[09:06] cheapest uh and and and small things
[09:08] like that that maybe adds up at €100 per
[09:11] year, but it adds up. And so if I had to
[09:15] guess, that's probably where it comes
[09:17] from, but I don't really know. So that
[09:19] that's just my my guess where I I I have
[09:21] it from perhaps as well if if if your
[09:24] dad set up his own business, there's a
[09:26] level of risk and reward as well in that
[09:28] approach, which if your dad just worked
[09:30] for a company, it's very different. So
[09:33] again it's worth conversation was do you
[09:35] think there was any influence in your
[09:37] mindset of how you approached investing
[09:39] and the risk and reward element of you
[09:41] have to take a little bit of risk in
[09:43] order to to get a good return. There's a
[09:46] lot of things I think my dad definitely
[09:48] gave that to me but also from from very
[09:51] young age I always was very curious
[09:53] about things uh and and I started
[09:54] investing and and and and started
[09:57] listening to to people online a lot like
[10:00] I consumed YouTube like I was an addict
[10:04] and I didn't consume any videos like I
[10:07] don't know like gaming videos or or
[10:09] stuff like that. I always even when I
[10:11] was like 16, 17 years old, I consumed
[10:14] videos on how to invest your money and
[10:17] how to pick stocks and and I was even in
[10:20] stock picking groups and I was probably
[10:21] the one of the youngest guys in there.
[10:24] Uh so that that was that was always my
[10:27] way of having fun. Even now if I I'm
[10:29] going out and not doing a podcast, I'm
[10:32] trying to learn about other things of
[10:33] like, oh, how to do actually a nice
[10:35] podcast, how to do the personal
[10:36] branding, uh how can I improve my
[10:38] speaking, how can I improve my writings,
[10:41] uh stuff like that. So, uh I'm I'm I'm a
[10:45] learner by by nature. Uh and and I get
[10:47] bored if if if I just look at uh gaming
[10:52] videos online. Uh and this was really
[10:54] cool with 18 years old uh and 17 years
[10:57] old and 16 years old. Uh but the
[10:59] important thing in that story is I think
[11:01] I got the fundamentals of how I treat
[11:05] money now from my parents and then I was
[11:08] also very curious and advanced on that
[11:11] this this base level of not spending but
[11:15] like saving and trying to accumulate
[11:17] capital. That's what I got from my
[11:19] parents and then how to invest and be a
[11:21] little bit more risk adverse. H I think
[11:23] that actually came from me more and more
[11:26] because my my dad was really
[11:27] conservative all all the time even
[11:29] though he was in a company. Um the other
[11:31] two partners was with a lot of more
[11:33] commitment and money in there and he
[11:35] only had I don't know what the exact
[11:37] percentage was like 5 10% and they were
[11:39] free partners. So he was a little bit
[11:40] more conservative and he's always very
[11:43] low risk. uh and I now tending to more a
[11:46] little bit more high risk than him and
[11:49] uh that that that turned out to be good
[11:51] in the end. Even though we we discussed
[11:54] on on my podcast when you were on
[11:56] Bitcoin is not that high risk. It's the
[11:58] other way around. Yeah, it is. Once you
[12:01] learn that before you learn it, it feels
[12:03] risky, but once you once you put the
[12:05] time in, you realize it's uh one of the
[12:07] lowest risk assets you can put your
[12:10] money into. So, how did you at what sort
[12:13] of age did you discover Bitcoin then?
[12:15] What was what was the journey? How did
[12:17] you first find out about Bitcoin? And
[12:19] what were your first experiences?
[12:21] I first got into Bitcoin in
[12:25] 2017. I didn't bought it back then, but
[12:29] in 2017, I got into a pyramid scheme.
[12:32] And this pyramid scheme uh uh was
[12:35] inviting me, hey, if you uh buy Bitcoin
[12:38] here, you can sell it to your friends
[12:40] and and then you can earn commissions on
[12:42] on on uh when they are buying and stuff
[12:45] like that. And it was basically a
[12:47] multi-level marketing scheme where
[12:49] there's a gray line. Is it illegal? Is
[12:51] it not? Uh it's definitely fishy. And
[12:53] this was this was my introduction to
[12:55] Bitcoin with a multi-level marketing
[12:57] scheme. And uh I did not enter that
[13:00] scheme but I was learning about Bitcoin
[13:04] from that scheme and I can remember that
[13:07] they talked about Bitcoin as new money
[13:09] and limited supply and stuff like that.
[13:12] So those learnings were already in there
[13:14] but it was connected with a scam. So for
[13:17] 3 years from 2017 to 2020 I actually
[13:20] thought that Bitcoin is a scam and
[13:22] Bitcoin is actually nothing good. In
[13:24] that period of time, I also developed my
[13:27] stock portfolio and I got quite
[13:29] successful in it. Um, partly because I
[13:32] was really obsessed with like what stock
[13:34] is really doing good, but also partly
[13:37] because it was just a good period of
[13:38] time to be in the stock market from 2017
[13:41] to 2020, especially after 2020 also. And
[13:44] in 2020, more and more friends came up
[13:46] to me and asked me about that Bitcoin
[13:48] thing because I was successful in the
[13:49] stock market. And the interesting thing
[13:51] is they were not even in Bitcoin. So
[13:53] there are just people that took interest
[13:55] in Bitcoin because it was a general
[13:57] topic of discussion and I was always
[14:00] saying it's a scam but at one day
[14:02] someone asked me more more about it and
[14:04] I was like discovering that I don't know
[14:07] a lot about Bitcoin to actually claim it
[14:10] is a scam. So I wanted to prove him
[14:13] wrong and say hey Bitcoin is a scam and
[14:16] in trying to prove him wrong in trying
[14:18] to learn more about Bitcoin to put the
[14:21] facts on the table and say like here
[14:23] that's why Bitcoin is a scheme that's
[14:25] how it works I actually discovered
[14:26] Bitcoin so it was a weekend from Friday
[14:28] to Sunday uh and uh I I went into
[14:32] Bitcoin watched videos uh uh read like
[14:35] online books read listened to audio
[14:38] books and tried to understand what
[14:40] Bitcoin this to try to convince my
[14:43] friend that it's a scam. But in that
[14:45] time, I actually uh discovered that
[14:47] Bitcoin might be something valuable. And
[14:50] so on Monday, I went ahead and bought
[14:52] some Bitcoin with €100 and bought a
[14:54] ledger and just tried it out. I was
[14:57] still very skeptical at first. I was
[14:59] still like, why does it has value?
[15:01] There's no company. There's no vision
[15:03] behind it and stuff like that. So why
[15:06] would we even need it? We already have
[15:08] money. It's already digital. Like I can
[15:10] use it. what what's the difference
[15:11] between euro and bitcoin and then also
[15:14] like what's the difference between
[15:15] bitcoin and ethereum and bitcoin and all
[15:17] the other things and what to invest in
[15:19] within bitcoin but at that point I was
[15:23] of the I was confident that bitcoin and
[15:27] crypto might be a great diversifier to
[15:31] my portfolio. So I was like, "Okay, I
[15:33] have my Tesla, I have my Apple, I have
[15:36] my Facebook." That was kind of my main
[15:38] investments. Did obviously really good,
[15:40] but I was like, "Okay, let's mix some
[15:41] Bitcoin in there." But once you have an
[15:43] asset, you tend to research that asset.
[15:46] And I dove deeper and deeper into what
[15:50] Bitcoin actually is. And this took me
[15:52] from 2020 to 2021 to go all in Bitcoin.
[15:57] So in within one year within the
[15:59] research period I went from Bitcoin is a
[16:02] scam or Bitcoin might be an interesting
[16:04] diversifier or Bitcoin is might be a
[16:06] little bit more to Bitcoin is fixing
[16:09] money and it's the next financial
[16:10] revolution and I'm selling everything
[16:13] except Bitcoin and I want to be all in
[16:15] Bitcoin. This took me a year to get
[16:17] there. Uh so it took me basically three
[16:19] years to get over the hurdle that
[16:21] Bitcoin is a scam and then another year
[16:22] to go all in. Uh and this is 2021. So
[16:26] now we have 2095 uh 2091 uh how old was
[16:30] I? Uh I was uh uh 23 23 22 years old. Uh
[16:36] so in with 21 years old I I got actually
[16:39] in Bitcoin. And I'm interested because
[16:41] your your English is excellent
[16:44] considering it's not your native
[16:46] language. But were there any barriers to
[16:49] learning about Bitcoin in a second
[16:51] language or do you think it actually
[16:53] helped improve your English? Because I
[16:56] would assume most of the content you
[16:57] were consuming was in English, was it? I
[17:00] I failed in uh I failed in school, my
[17:04] English class. I had to repeat one year
[17:06] of school because of English. Um which
[17:09] is very funny. I couldn't even talk back
[17:12] then in English and I couldn't write. uh
[17:14] my grammar was really bad sometimes in
[17:17] titles and and description still happens
[17:19] things but uh AI is helping me a lot to
[17:22] put my grammar better uh on the way uh
[17:25] before my school ended in
[17:28] 2018 or 19 in the summer uh I basically
[17:32] went uh to my to my father and said hey
[17:35] uh I I really want to improve my English
[17:38] uh before I get out of school um uh and
[17:42] I think a language which week would be
[17:45] best for me to to to do. Uh but I don't
[17:48] have the money to to do that. And I was
[17:50] also too greedy to to put my own money
[17:52] in. And so I was like, can you please
[17:54] pay me that? And and after some
[17:56] convincing months and uh a good good
[17:59] convincing work from me. He actually did
[18:01] it. And and he paid basically a month
[18:03] for me in Malta. And in that one month,
[18:06] I stopped talking any German and I only
[18:10] talked English. This was basically my
[18:12] English breakthrough. Before I learned
[18:15] everything in German, listened to
[18:17] everything in German, watched everything
[18:18] in German, consumed everything in
[18:20] German. And then I slowly slowly
[18:22] developed my English language. Now I
[18:25] talk almost in English. My girlfriend is
[18:29] English because she's from from India.
[18:31] So she we can only speak in English. I
[18:33] talk with the podcast every day in
[18:35] English. Um, most of my business
[18:38] partners are English- speakaking. Uh,
[18:41] and only my some of my friends even are
[18:44] English- speakaking. Some friends are
[18:46] are German. Some uh my family members
[18:49] are obviously German. Uh, but I I speak
[18:52] in in the average week like 95% English.
[18:55] And I I got like I consumed also in
[19:00] Bitcoin everything in English already.
[19:02] So, by the time I went into Bitcoin, I
[19:05] did not listen to any of the the German
[19:07] influences. I I almost only listened to
[19:10] the English ones. But I have to say, I
[19:14] don't know if it's in every language
[19:15] like that, but I'm extremely impressed
[19:18] by the quality and the quantity that we
[19:21] have in the German speaking area within
[19:24] Bitcoin. They are really good. And this
[19:26] was one reason why I didn't do it in
[19:29] German because I had the decision like
[19:31] do I go in German or in English? And uh
[19:35] obviously the English market is really
[19:37] good. Uh there are a lot of great people
[19:39] in there. Uh but is the same true in
[19:43] German or is there an easier hole to
[19:46] fill and there isn't. They they are
[19:49] amazing. They're doing really good. Uh
[19:52] uh the Roman Rea for example, one of the
[19:54] biggest ones, has over 200,000
[19:57] subscribers on uh on YouTube and he's
[19:59] Bitcoin only and only in German. So that
[20:02] that's really good. That that's that's
[20:05] Preston Bish Natalie Brunell level, but
[20:08] he does it only in German. So we have
[20:11] really great content creators and
[20:13] educators in German. So there's there
[20:15] was no need for me to choose between one
[20:18] or two the other just because of game
[20:21] theory and where has bigger hold with
[20:22] it. So I was thinking English is better
[20:25] because I consume everything in English.
[20:27] I like talking in English in Bitcoin and
[20:29] the guests um if I want to have a
[20:31] podcast and I have a German podcast the
[20:35] guests are running out way quicker than
[20:37] in English and English there's just
[20:40] English is the German market plus the
[20:42] whole all of the world because turns out
[20:44] most of the Germans also speak English
[20:46] quite well and you can have them on the
[20:47] podcasts also I think like 5% of my
[20:50] guests probably are are German speaking
[20:53] yeah in terms of your conviction sorry
[20:56] you asked a different questions. I
[20:58] completely forgot about your question.
[21:00] You asked the the language barrier. It's
[21:02] actually that's why I that's why I
[21:04] talked about the the content creators. I
[21:06] think actually right now um I don't
[21:08] think we have barriers of entry for
[21:10] Germans because they cannot speak
[21:12] English because we have such a great
[21:15] content variety and depth of content in
[21:18] German. And there's for example a German
[21:20] podcaster uh that does one two uh per
[21:24] week and since years he has a library of
[21:26] like 500 600 episodes in German. And
[21:31] he's not the only one. He's just the
[21:32] biggest one. There's like uh 10 20 other
[21:35] podcasts that you can listen to. Uh
[21:37] there are content creators that do live
[21:39] streams almost every day. Uh the people
[21:42] that do report on the news uh in in in
[21:45] Bitcoin.
[21:46] uh in German there's not a problem but I
[21:50] do know that there are many other
[21:51] languages like in Hungary I I hear it
[21:54] all the time with Hungarian there's not
[21:56] too much content there and there are
[21:58] those smaller countries with smaller
[22:01] audiences that do have struggle
[22:03] sometimes with orange spilling people
[22:06] because all the great content is in
[22:08] English or in other big languages like
[22:11] German but it's not in their local show
[22:14] that is a problem And I do encourage
[22:16] everyone that is maybe in one of those
[22:19] smaller countries to start taking
[22:22] Bitcoin seriously and look at the
[22:24] market. Look at the English market and
[22:25] the your local market, let's say
[22:27] Hungary. And if you don't see a lot of
[22:29] content creators, that's your
[22:31] opportunity to be a big person in that
[22:34] community. Yeah. With Bitcoin focus. So
[22:37] I think that's an important message
[22:38] there. Yeah. I think um Joe Brian who
[22:41] did the what's the problem video which
[22:43] went wildly beyond his dreams in terms
[22:46] of how widely that was shared and spread
[22:48] and the positivity of the feedback he's
[22:50] had from it but there have been loads of
[22:52] people that have converted that
[22:53] translated it rather into their native
[22:57] language and it's it's great to see like
[22:59] almost every other day there's a it's
[23:01] now been translated into Hungarian into
[23:04] all of these different languages which
[23:06] hopefully will be one of the triggers
[23:08] that managed to get people that don't
[23:11] have access or don't have knowledge in
[23:13] English to be able to access a lot of
[23:15] the content that is there to get their
[23:17] first little snippet of information that
[23:19] might take them on their journey. Yeah,
[23:21] Joe is is really cool. had him on my my
[23:24] podcast and those are this is just one
[23:27] story where a guy that wasn't public in
[23:31] in Bitcoin saw an opportunity and he had
[23:35] already a presentation basically for his
[23:38] friends and families and took this and I
[23:40] was like okay let's do just a
[23:42] professional setup and make a 40-minute
[23:45] video or something like that what it is
[23:47] long and put it out there if it's good
[23:50] it will be picked up everywhere and
[23:52] people will love it and people will put
[23:54] you on all the podcasts and I see him
[23:56] also speaking at events now. So it is
[24:00] right now possible for anyone to be like
[24:03] okay I want to contribute my story or my
[24:08] perspective or my angle on Bitcoin and
[24:10] you can be on he was on what money is
[24:13] with Rory Pelov he was on my podcast he
[24:16] was on many many other podcasts uh and
[24:18] go there and be invited there just
[24:20] because we still have a huge need in
[24:24] educating people we have now what like
[24:28] 1% of the world population that has a
[24:32] fundamental grasp on what what Bitcoin
[24:34] really is probably even lower than that.
[24:37] So if you're now starting out as a
[24:39] content creator, as an educator, you
[24:42] have 99% of the world still uh as an
[24:46] opportunity market. Uh plus if you do a
[24:50] good job, you probably get the 1% that's
[24:53] already educated also in in your
[24:55] audience. educators in Bitcoin is
[24:59] probably one of the most important
[25:02] things that you could do in the next 10
[25:04] to 20 years outside of building
[25:06] technology that scales Bitcoin on the
[25:09] payment rails like those two things
[25:11] really compete with each other that the
[25:13] educators and people that build out the
[25:15] the the payment rails because they are
[25:17] also really important in the future.
[25:20] Yeah, I completely agree with your
[25:22] conviction. you went from being a a kind
[25:25] of guy to getting a bit of Bitcoin and
[25:28] then within the space of 12 months going
[25:30] all in. Was there were there any outside
[25:32] of the normal videos and books that that
[25:35] people will access like your broken
[25:36] money bitcoin standard were there any
[25:39] individuals or any content that that
[25:41] stood out for you outside of the normal
[25:43] ones that really triggered something in
[25:45] you that that flicked the switch?
[25:47] Unfortunately not. It was um a very
[25:50] boring orange spilling journey between
[25:52] Siphon Moose as his work, Robert Pedlo,
[25:56] Michael Sailor, Anthony Pompiano. Those
[25:59] are probably the the the big influences
[26:02] and influences not as social media but
[26:05] like who influenced my thinking on
[26:07] Bitcoin a lot. Those what I had to
[26:10] really struggle with was that there is
[26:13] no cash flow in Bitcoin. If you come
[26:15] from the stock world, you always try to
[26:17] figure out a cash flow. That's why I
[26:20] actually wanted to go in real estate. I
[26:23] did not wanted to go into Bitcoin or
[26:25] anything like that. I actually wanted to
[26:27] do diversify into real estate because
[26:29] okay, I had a stock portfolio. How can I
[26:32] further enhance my portfolio? Okay,
[26:35] let's do real estate. There's a cash
[26:37] flow, there's capital, I can work with
[26:40] credit. That seems like a great
[26:42] opportunity. Uh, and this was the same
[26:45] year where I also discovered Bitcoin in
[26:47] 2020. Um, and thankfully I discovered
[26:50] Bitcoin because, uh, real estate can be
[26:53] quite a headache. I never got into it. I
[26:55] never really, uh, did a deal, but from
[26:58] everyone that I talk to that does real
[27:00] estate always tells me it's a real
[27:02] headache. And they wish they just have
[27:05] instead of that one real estate real
[27:07] estate uh, property, Bitcoin instead of
[27:10] that. that that would be so much better
[27:12] in any way. So, this is something um I I
[27:16] think about a lot how I overcame the
[27:19] barrier of Bitcoin is has no cash flow
[27:22] and that's good that it is a good thing
[27:24] that it has no cash flow that it's a
[27:26] commodity that it's money that's a
[27:28] financial revolution that there's behind
[27:30] behind there and it's not just another
[27:33] way of making money or like a company or
[27:35] or a real estate property.
[27:38] So, are you pretty much fully allocated
[27:41] now to Bitcoin then? Everything you
[27:43] have, you you put into Bitcoin, a
[27:45] complete Bitcoin maxi. I I do have
[27:48] everything in Bitcoin. I also do earn
[27:51] already in Bitcoin. Um like around I
[27:54] don't know over 50% of my income is
[27:57] already in in Bitcoin. Um uh and it
[28:00] keeps on growing the Bitcoin part. Uh
[28:03] and even pay in Bitcoin. I I have uh two
[28:06] employees and I pay one of them in in
[28:08] Bitcoin. Uh so yeah uh I'm I'm I
[28:13] completely switched to a Bitcoin
[28:16] standard. I even try to be in Bitcoin as
[28:21] a unit of account. When you make the
[28:23] switch from Bitcoin not only as a store
[28:26] of value or meaning of exchange but as a
[28:28] unit of account. So you think in
[28:30] Bitcoin, you think in Satoshi's, you get
[28:33] away from the emotional roller coaster
[28:35] that is like bull and bare market. Uh
[28:38] because Bitcoin can shoot up 50%, 100%
[28:42] or like 200 300% uh within a short
[28:45] period of time. Uh and we as humans
[28:49] think all of the sudden, oh wow, we
[28:51] we're so clever. We we invest in one
[28:54] thing and all of a sudden it shoots up
[28:55] 200%. But you didn't get any smarter
[28:59] just because Bitcoin is going up 200%.
[29:02] On the flip side, if Bitcoin is crashing
[29:04] down 20%, we are feeling lower. I I can
[29:07] all I can even see it in the sentiment
[29:09] on on YouTube and on on on the fuse a
[29:12] little bit where when Bitcoin is
[29:13] crashing, we like that Bitcoin thing and
[29:16] like the sentiment is down and you feel
[29:18] a little bit dumber. But just because
[29:20] Bitcoin is down, you're not dumber. And
[29:22] and the same is true for upside. If if
[29:24] Bitcoin is up 50%, you're not 50% smart
[29:27] all of a sudden. And if you are going
[29:30] out of that mindset and completely
[29:33] switching yourself to Bitcoin standard
[29:35] and thinking your net worth in
[29:37] Satoshi's, whatever you have, maybe it's
[29:40] 10,000 Satoshi's, maybe it's 100,000
[29:42] Satoshi's, maybe it's 300 million
[29:44] Satoshi's, whatever the amount in
[29:47] Satoshi is, don't think of like, oh, I
[29:49] have to get to one bitcoin or 10 bitcoin
[29:52] or half a bitcoin. it doesn't make
[29:54] sense. You you just keep on getting your
[29:58] stack a little bit bigger every month.
[30:01] That that's literally all you have to
[30:02] do. And this literally all you can do in
[30:05] terms of why go all in. I got to the
[30:09] realization that I don't want to do have
[30:12] anything to do with the fiat system.
[30:14] That's why I also don't own micro
[30:16] strategy. Even though I knew from the
[30:19] beginning that's a great stock, but I
[30:22] don't want to do anything with with that
[30:24] fear system right now. Um, and sometimes
[30:27] it hurts not to be invested in in
[30:30] strategy B how it's called now. Um, or
[30:34] to be some or to have a credit running
[30:38] uh to invest more in Bitcoin than I
[30:40] actually have would have been a great
[30:43] choice if I have had done it 5 years
[30:46] ago. put like a 100 grand on a credit
[30:50] and just uh bought Bitcoin with that.
[30:52] Bitcoin in five years ago was at 3,000
[30:55] or 6,000 or 7,000 depending on on which
[30:59] month you're looking at. With 100,000
[31:01] euros, you can buy a lot of Bitcoin and
[31:03] this would have been an amazing uh trade
[31:06] that would have probably changed my
[31:08] life. But I don't want to deal with the
[31:10] fiat system. I just want to stack my
[31:13] Bitcoin and keep seeing my stack growing
[31:18] slowly, organically, and humbly every
[31:20] month a little bit. Yeah. And this is
[31:23] the the the biggest shift that I made
[31:25] from being all in Bitcoin of using
[31:29] Bitcoin as that that pillar. We spoke a
[31:32] bit about this yesterday in terms of the
[31:34] different ages where people are finding
[31:36] Bitcoin and getting in. And it's
[31:38] interesting you say you don't want to be
[31:40] part of the fiat world. And I completely
[31:43] understand that. And I guess this part
[31:45] of me wishes I could be more like that.
[31:49] But at the age I'm at late, I've got a
[31:52] house with a mortgage. I built up a
[31:54] pension over my life. If if you were if
[31:57] you could imagine yourself now at let's
[32:01] say you had a more traditional career
[32:02] because you you found Bitcoin and you
[32:05] work in Bitcoin now at a relatively
[32:07] young age. If you had more of a
[32:09] corporate job and say you were now in
[32:12] your early 30s and you had make a number
[32:15] up 20% of your net worth was in in a
[32:18] pension that you had. How do you think
[32:20] you would approach that with your
[32:21] mindset? Now I have to say that I also
[32:24] have a pension. Not because I like that,
[32:26] but because Austria forces you to have
[32:28] one. You actually have to allocate some
[32:30] money there and you cannot get it out.
[32:33] Uh unless you are out of work. So I
[32:35] wouldn't need to officially say I'm
[32:37] broke and I don't have a job. Please can
[32:39] I get my money out? And as long as I
[32:41] have a running business, it's it's kind
[32:43] of complicated to do. Do you have any
[32:45] influence over what that invests in
[32:46] though or is it a state run? Actually
[32:49] not. Uh it it's called employee. It's
[32:52] it's hard to uh uh uh translate, but
[32:54] it's basically 1% or 1.4% of your whole
[32:58] salary. Uh you have to invest in
[33:01] something. You never see that money on
[33:03] your side, the employee basically puts
[33:06] it away for you. And if you are self uh
[33:10] self-employed, uh you still have to pay
[33:12] that. You have no no chance of fleeing
[33:14] that. uh you can only lower your your
[33:17] thing depending on on on uh on how you
[33:19] structure your company and stuff. You
[33:21] can only choose the provider, but the
[33:24] provider chooses what to invest in and
[33:27] there are only five providers and they
[33:29] are pretty much doing the same thing. I
[33:32] researched all five of them and there's
[33:36] no real difference between them in in
[33:38] the strategy of of how they employ it.
[33:41] Um, so I didn't take a decision because
[33:44] if you don't decide which provider, you
[33:47] get randomly selected one. And I was
[33:49] like, that sounds fine to me because I
[33:51] researched all of them and there's
[33:53] literally no advantage to any one of
[33:54] them. So that's something I have. Uh, if
[33:57] I had the opportunity to, for example,
[33:59] invest that in strategy or like Bitcoin
[34:02] ETF, I obviously would do it. Uh, but I
[34:04] don't even have the the option to. So I
[34:07] do hope uh from that perspective that
[34:10] bit bitcoin just comes more and more
[34:11] more in this traditional financial model
[34:14] so that they are also having an exposure
[34:16] to bitcoin automatically because it's
[34:19] still my money even though I never saw
[34:20] it even though uh they have it and they
[34:23] have the control of it I I still want to
[34:26] see that grow but in my mind uh
[34:29] I don't consider that my money if I
[34:33] never see that money I'm not surprised
[34:35] honestly let's take Take a break for a
[34:37] moment and appreciate the beauty that
[34:40] Coin Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[34:43] watches. Those watches are the most
[34:45] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[34:48] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[34:52] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[34:54] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[34:58] watch collections. You have the date of
[35:00] the first ever mined Bitcoin block in
[35:03] there and of course also the block
[35:05] height and which epoch we are currently
[35:08] in. I love the level of detail they put
[35:11] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[35:14] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[35:17] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[35:19] love those watches so so much. And now
[35:22] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[35:25] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[35:27] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[35:29] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[35:31] first way is you put it on a hardware
[35:33] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[35:36] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[35:39] Bitbox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[35:42] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[35:45] if you check out the link in the
[35:47] description, you even get 5% off if you
[35:50] use the code Robin. And the second way
[35:52] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[35:56] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[35:59] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[36:02] They will personalize for you a
[36:04] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[36:07] your individual situation. They will
[36:10] show you how you can secure your own
[36:12] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[36:14] enough. You also have to keep all your
[36:16] devices secure. One topic that is
[36:19] overlooked often is the inheritance
[36:21] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[36:24] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[36:27] a plan for that in place already? And
[36:29] last but not least, if you're in a
[36:31] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[36:34] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[36:36] that, head over to the
[36:40] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[36:43] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[36:46] be for the first time ever speaking at
[36:48] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[36:51] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[36:53] really looking forward to seeing all of
[36:55] you there. You can get your ticket in
[36:58] the link down in the description of
[37:00] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[37:02] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[37:06] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[37:08] there. You're not depending on that for
[37:10] your future preservation of wealth. It's
[37:13] just it's a necessary a necessity. You
[37:16] have to put that money in, but if you
[37:18] could opt out, you would. I I basically
[37:20] see it as a tax currently honestly. Um
[37:23] but you asked a question uh which is a
[37:26] really interesting one. Um how how you
[37:30] behave differently depending on what age
[37:32] you are and I think it's it's I think
[37:36] it's less a question of age and it's
[37:38] more a question of your life
[37:40] circumstances. So if you are 50 and you
[37:46] are single, you don't have a wife, you
[37:48] don't have kids, and you live rent and
[37:50] you have uh you have a good paying job,
[37:53] why not go all
[37:54] in? It's it's you don't have any you
[37:58] don't have a lot of risk to carry. But
[38:00] if you're 40 and you have four kids and
[38:03] you have a wife and the wife is at home
[38:06] and and cares for the kids, so you at
[38:07] the single income and you have a house
[38:10] and and you have more responsibility,
[38:12] maybe you even have a small company
[38:13] where you have to feed also 20 employees
[38:16] or something like that. Um then saying
[38:19] I'm going all in Bitcoin and I don't
[38:21] care is a way more uh different approach
[38:24] to when you are single, no wife, no kids
[38:27] and stuff like that. So I I I like to go
[38:29] away from the model of looking at how
[38:32] old you are and rather go like what's
[38:35] your life circumstances. The age only
[38:37] matters if you look for Bitcoin in
[38:40] retirement. So if you say like oh I want
[38:42] to retire on Bitcoin then the age really
[38:44] matters because if I want to retire now
[38:48] I better have a lot of Bitcoin because I
[38:51] might live another 80 years if I'm
[38:53] making sports all the time. I I try to
[38:56] sleep good. that try to eat good
[38:58] medication and all those things getting
[39:00] better and better over time. According
[39:02] to Brian Johnson, maybe we don't die at
[39:04] all. So you have you have to consider
[39:06] all those things. If you are 80 years
[39:08] old, you might need a little less
[39:11] bitcoin just because of the life
[39:13] expectancy. This just a practical thing
[39:15] of like how many years do you think you
[39:18] will still live and also what are your
[39:20] life circumstances? If you are uh if you
[39:23] want to live in Thailand and uh you have
[39:25] a small apartment there, you have
[39:26] probably 1/3 or 1/4 or 1/5 of the cost
[39:29] that someone with a I don't know London
[39:32] or New York City or Miami apartment and
[39:35] the the way of life is just way cheaper
[39:37] there. And also again, do you have a
[39:39] wife that you also have to feed? Do you
[39:41] have kids that you also have to feed? Do
[39:43] you have a running company that you
[39:44] still are involved in? Do you have in
[39:46] your retirement still income? because
[39:48] some people just want to retire but they
[39:50] do something else and then there's the
[39:51] question of do you still have income
[39:53] there. So the age does matter because
[39:56] the circumstances of life usually
[39:58] changes with age but it's more about the
[40:00] circumstances and not just about the the
[40:03] age. Uh I also now uh because I have a
[40:09] small company with with two employees
[40:11] that want to get paid monthly and I
[40:13] don't want to upset them. um I'm
[40:15] planning for those that so h how many
[40:18] months can I pay them uh without getting
[40:22] broke? How many months can I can I run
[40:24] that? Uh my business is very cost
[40:27] inefficient. So it's a good one. Uh but
[40:30] if you have a bigger one or maybe you
[40:32] have material costs uh and stuff like
[40:34] that, then it gets very quick, very
[40:36] complicated and you you might want to
[40:38] have operating costs. And I talked with
[40:40] so many CEOs that have Bitcoin on the
[40:43] balance sheet starting from Michael
[40:45] Sailor, but also smaller ones from
[40:48] Tahini and other companies and they all
[40:52] basically have operating costs and they
[40:54] all have some money laying around in
[40:57] some form and I think if you take out
[40:59] Michael a strategy because it's just
[41:02] such a huge company and most cannot
[41:04] relate to that but the heinis is maybe a
[41:06] little bit of a more relatable story
[41:09] because it's a just a way smaller and
[41:11] more medium-sized business even though
[41:12] they are growing fast. Also, the CEO
[41:14] said to me that they always have I think
[41:17] it was 6 months, maybe I'm wrong here,
[41:19] they always have 6 months worth of feat
[41:22] of running operating costs on their
[41:24] balance sheet and the rest goes into
[41:26] Bitcoin. And if you look at that also
[41:28] with your personal setup, maybe you want
[41:31] to have one month, two months, a year
[41:35] worth of fiat and the rest goes into
[41:37] Bitcoin. Uh but it highly depends on on
[41:40] on what your life circumstances is.
[41:42] That's why everything that goes in the
[41:44] advice line of what to do with your own
[41:47] money. I basically always say research
[41:51] do do the best you can because I don't
[41:53] know you and I don't know your personal
[41:55] situation. I can just give general
[41:58] things like stack every month a little
[42:01] bit more Bitcoin and if you want to
[42:03] retire on Bitcoin, try to be extra
[42:06] conservative and figure out which number
[42:08] it is and double that number and this is
[42:11] your stacking goal and and stuff like
[42:12] that to be safe. But yeah, like I'm I'm
[42:15] not uh someone asked me that last time
[42:17] if I ever want to be a financial advisor
[42:20] one day. uh because I've learned a lot
[42:22] with with all my guests, not only about
[42:24] Bitcoin, but also actually about
[42:25] finances and mindset and all those
[42:27] things. And actually, I don't want to do
[42:30] that. Uh it's it's not something I I
[42:34] think it would maybe make sense. Uh but
[42:36] it's so personal and I I would need to
[42:39] learn a lot more about money to make me
[42:42] feel really comfortable giving someone
[42:44] else a twice on their own money. Yeah,
[42:46] that that would make me feel like really
[42:48] stressed out. I would need to have way
[42:51] more knowledge than I have right now.
[42:53] Yeah. I I often find within Bitcoin
[42:57] sometimes it's quite black and white
[42:59] within the community where there are
[43:01] certain people who say this is the only
[43:03] way you have to go. If you call yourself
[43:05] a Bitcoiner, this is what you have to
[43:07] do. But even aside from the age
[43:10] differences and responsibilities and
[43:11] whether you have a family and dependence
[43:14] or not and a business you're trying to
[43:16] support, you know, there's the emotional
[43:18] and the psychological
[43:20] uh impacts of of money and finance that
[43:23] that that you can have. So whereas one
[43:25] person might sleep easy knowing 100% of
[43:29] everything they have is in Bitcoin,
[43:32] someone else might be as much of a
[43:34] Bitcoiner but think I want the security
[43:37] of having 3 months worth of living
[43:40] expenses in fiat just so that I know
[43:43] that's there. And I I sometimes think
[43:47] some of those nuances around the
[43:50] approach maybe isn't as vibrant in
[43:52] Bitcoin as it is in more traditional
[43:55] finance conversations. Yeah. And one
[43:58] thing I I want to make very clear is
[44:00] when we look at Bitcoin and we look at
[44:02] like how do we accumulate Bitcoin and
[44:04] and and and how much should we
[44:07] accumulate and and and what the
[44:09] percentages and what is the basically
[44:10] the personal advice towards Bitcoin.
[44:13] Bitcoin is right now so early and I
[44:16] showed this uh I think yesterday in in I
[44:20] think it's not in was not in your
[44:21] podcast was in a different podcast uh in
[44:23] in in another podcast where I showed
[44:25] where in the curve in adoption we are uh
[44:28] River put a great chart out where it
[44:31] compared uh the internet uh bitcoin uh
[44:35] and uh social media uh and one more
[44:38] thing to each other and it put out the
[44:41] different ages and the different years
[44:43] where we are and basically Bitcoin is
[44:46] currently in 2025 obviously um and the
[44:50] same group uh and the same basically
[44:53] adoption progress is right now with the
[44:57] internet in 1990. A lot of people think
[45:00] we are way close already to 1995 2000
[45:04] maybe even after the com bubble uh but
[45:07] actually if you look at the numbers
[45:09] we're not quite there yet. We at 3%
[45:12] adoption and 97% is still happening. And
[45:16] this is I think the important thing
[45:19] because we get this fear of missing out.
[45:21] We get this, oh, I don't have enough
[45:23] Bitcoin. Bitcoin is such a fundamental
[45:26] shift in our
[45:28] civilization that I always I I see it as
[45:32] almost a fork in the road of human
[45:34] civilization. a similar thing as the
[45:37] printing press or as the internet was
[45:40] where everything afterwards is so
[45:42] radically different then that just
[45:45] having 5% of your whole net worth in
[45:48] Bitcoin might just change your life. So
[45:50] don't be bothered if you say like oh I
[45:53] only have 0.01 Bitcoin. We we have all
[45:57] seen those tweets where someone said, "I
[46:00] only have 8,000 Bitcoin. I'm selling
[46:03] tomorrow because uh I I will never have
[46:07] a good amount of Bitcoin." And he has
[46:09] 8,000 Bitcoin. Now we say like, "Why did
[46:12] you just hang on to those uh 8,000
[46:14] Bitcoin?" Because back in the day, it
[46:16] was not worth anything. It was maybe
[46:18] a,000.
[46:20] Now 8,000 Bitcoin. I'm not that good in
[46:23] in in head with maths, but it's a lot of
[46:25] money uh in in in US dollars. When we
[46:29] come to Bitcoin and and we realize how
[46:33] big of a change that will be in society,
[46:36] you don't have to go all in. If you're a
[46:39] maniac like me, you go all in, but you
[46:42] don't have to go all in to make it
[46:45] worthwhile uh the Bitcoin ride. Uh I
[46:49] just realized that I don't want to do
[46:50] anything with bit uh with fiat but only
[46:53] having 5% 10% 20% of your net worth
[46:56] could be potentially completely
[46:58] life-changing for you because Bitcoin is
[47:02] a fork in a road technology for a lack
[47:04] of a better word I will call it like
[47:06] that where everything else will change
[47:08] after that or it goes to zero and I
[47:11] don't think Bitcoin is ever going to
[47:13] zero so it probably will change the
[47:16] course of human civilization.
[47:18] Do you think someone who only has 10%
[47:20] 15% of their net worth in Bitcoin should
[47:23] be considered less of a Bitcoiner?
[47:26] Uh I think everyone has their own
[47:28] definitions of Bitcoiner. Um for for
[47:31] some people a bitcoin is only someone
[47:33] that is only on Bitcoin and they are
[47:37] only eating meat and they are exercising
[47:39] every day and they're not eating any
[47:41] seed oils uh and and they are doing all
[47:44] the they don't use sunscreen also I
[47:47] heard so they doing all those things and
[47:49] then they only a bitcoiner then the
[47:51] other definition is like everyone that
[47:53] has Bitcoin is a Bitcoiner. Everyone
[47:55] that is on Facebook is a Facebook user.
[47:57] Everyone that is has access to the
[47:58] internet is a user of the internet. Why
[48:01] are we saying now on Bitcoin, oh just
[48:04] because you have only 1% in Bitcoin,
[48:06] you're not a Bitcoin user. You are out
[48:08] of the game. You need at least 50% of
[48:10] your net worth in Bitcoin. Then also why
[48:13] are we putting a net worth? Maybe you
[48:15] only a bitcoin. If you have 0.1 bitcoin,
[48:18] okay, then soon nobody will be bitcoiner
[48:21] because uh a 0.1 bitcoin if bitcoin is
[48:24] successful will not be accessible to a
[48:26] lot of people. Uh so I think a bitcoiner
[48:29] is a person who has bitcoin. One more
[48:35] interesting factor in that is if you
[48:37] actually have bitcoin or not. Uh because
[48:39] a lot of people have um strategy stocks
[48:44] or have Bitcoin ETF or have Bitcoin IU
[48:49] on an exchange. You could make an solid
[48:52] argument that this is not a Bitcoiner. I
[48:55] would still say if you hold Bitcoin on
[48:58] exchange or Bitcoin ETF, you're kind of
[49:00] a Bitcoiner. Um I don't recommend you
[49:05] holding it, not yourself. uh but you're
[49:07] still kind of a user because you enhance
[49:09] the the overall ecosystem. You're using
[49:11] an ecosystem. If you use a Bitcoin
[49:13] exchange, Bitcoin exchanges are part of
[49:16] the Bitcoin ecosystem. So, a Bitcoin
[49:18] user and self-custody is also something
[49:20] that won't be available for everyone
[49:22] long term. Yeah, a Bitcoin is just a
[49:25] person that uses Bitcoin. I think it can
[49:28] be a journey as well, can't it? And
[49:29] there are different ways that you can
[49:31] onramp into Bitcoin. And if someone
[49:36] allocates sells a bit of their S&P 500
[49:39] in their um portfolio to get a Bitcoin
[49:44] ETF, you would hope that would be the
[49:46] start of a journey that would lead them
[49:48] to understanding more and realizing that
[49:50] that isn't really they aren't really
[49:52] owning that and they should consider
[49:55] buying spot Bitcoin, self-custody, cold
[49:57] storage, and all of the things that that
[50:01] people learn through the journey of of
[50:03] understanding more about Bitcoin. Yeah,
[50:06] it's and we also have to recognize that
[50:09] the different parts of the world having
[50:12] different speeds of adoption. We still
[50:16] have parts in this world that don't have
[50:18] electricity that don't have there are
[50:22] what are like 3 billion or 4 billion
[50:24] people in the world or maybe even more
[50:27] than that that don't have the internet
[50:29] and access to the internet. If you take
[50:31] away the internet in Austria, a lot of
[50:34] people lose their jobs because their
[50:36] jobs are only on the internet. Most
[50:38] businesses probably will have a major
[50:41] problem if the internet is not working
[50:43] because all their documents are on the
[50:45] internet. With electricity, even worse,
[50:48] even worse than the than internet is is
[50:51] electricity. And some parts of the world
[50:53] never got to have the internet or
[50:55] electricity. And with Bitcoin, it will
[50:57] be quite the same actually where we have
[51:00] parts of the world that are fully on a
[51:01] Bitcoin standard. They're paying taxes
[51:03] in Bitcoin. The government is behind
[51:05] Bitcoin. Everything will be Bitcoinized.
[51:07] And it's it's almost a utopia Bitcoin
[51:10] world. And there are other parts of the
[51:12] world where Bitcoin is not allowed or
[51:16] not possible or not that far advanced
[51:19] yet. The sim the thing is actually quite
[51:21] the same as the internet and with other
[51:23] things because there's game theory
[51:25] coming in. A country that doesn't has
[51:27] electricity,
[51:29] doesn't have Bitcoin will be lagging
[51:32] behind a lot to those countries that
[51:35] have electricity, internet and Bitcoin
[51:38] because they are just way more connected
[51:40] and have way better possibilities. Uh
[51:42] it's like oh you you you are going in in
[51:45] a fight. Yeah. If you have a gun, you
[51:47] will win that fight. even though if you
[51:49] have no muscles. Um and the the similar
[51:52] way is if you have Bitcoin, the internet
[51:55] and electricity, you will win over the
[51:57] people that don't have internet,
[52:00] electricity, and Bitcoin. Uh and I
[52:03] think coming back to the point of
[52:05] Bitcoin is a fork in the road. As soon
[52:07] as you have Bitcoin, you will get
[52:10] yourself to the con conviction that you
[52:12] will need more Bitcoin at the end. Uh
[52:14] I'm I'm quite sure if you're honest and
[52:16] and and listen and and uh really educate
[52:19] yourself more and more in the story. But
[52:21] just the fact that you have Bitcoin
[52:24] shows uh that you are um already uh open
[52:29] to the idea and then you can actually
[52:31] embrace it and then all of the sudden
[52:33] you are that guy with a gun in the fist
[52:36] fight. uh and uh this is the advantage
[52:40] that Bitcoiners have and that's a game
[52:42] theory aspect because once one gets a
[52:44] gun and sees the power that he has with
[52:46] that gun, the other people also want to
[52:48] get a gun because then it's two with a
[52:50] gun. Then it's a little bit more fair.
[52:52] If it's just one of gun, the structure
[52:55] is quite quite
[52:56] uh Yeah, sure. When it comes to
[52:59] volatility, how does that make you feel?
[53:01] If you if you woke up tomorrow and saw
[53:02] Bitcoin was $250,000 or you woke up and
[53:06] saw it was
[53:08] $50,000, would you how would you feel
[53:10] differently in those two scenarios? Um
[53:13] uh the emotional impact is almost
[53:18] non-existent at that point. Uh because
[53:21] I've been now 5 years in Bitcoin. Uh and
[53:24] I have bitco I've seen Bitcoin I think
[53:26] the lowest it was was 6,000. uh and the
[53:30] highest was
[53:31] 107,000 or something like that. Um and
[53:35] everything in between. I have written
[53:38] Bitcoin from 6,000 to 60,000 to 50,000
[53:43] to almost 70,000 all the way down to
[53:46] 16,000 all the way up to 106,000. And I
[53:49] never sold and I learned what Bitcoin is
[53:51] and I have my conviction and I know it's
[53:53] coming back. And this is I I don't have
[53:56] any fear anymore that Bitcoin won't be
[54:00] what I think it is. But I can actually
[54:02] relate to the volatility in another way
[54:05] because might be a silly comparison now
[54:07] and I never made that but YouTube views
[54:09] are very volatile and we talked about it
[54:12] before we we started recording and this
[54:14] is actually something where I get fear
[54:16] when the video views are way down the
[54:18] previous month. I'm like maybe that's
[54:20] the end. Maybe now nobody's interested
[54:22] anymore in my channel. Maybe it's going
[54:25] all bust like uh maybe I'm Shadowban,
[54:27] maybe maybe this is like you all you get
[54:30] crazy like Like maybe everything
[54:32] is going thing is gone now. And then you
[54:34] listen to to people that have built
[54:36] YouTube channels and you go ahead and
[54:39] and and look at the history of Marcus
[54:41] Brownley and Mr. Beast and Mr. Beast was
[54:45] or I think Marcus Brownley is a great
[54:46] example. MKHDB, I think, or something
[54:49] like that. He's is called. He's one of
[54:51] the biggest names when it comes to
[54:53] reviewing iPhones and stuff like that.
[54:54] And he has millions and millions of
[54:56] followers on YouTube. Um, he took over
[54:59] 100 videos to get to his first 100
[55:02] subscribers. Obviously, it was a
[55:04] different world back then, but the fact
[55:06] remains he made over, I think it was 107
[55:09] videos to come to 100 subscribers. And
[55:13] and I'm coming to the connection uh to
[55:15] Bitcoin in a second. This always shows
[55:18] me like I'm just doing it one year like
[55:20] of course it's all that of course I'm
[55:22] learning of course it will be uh months
[55:24] where it goes really good and months
[55:26] where it goes really bad. Uh and it's
[55:28] all about conviction. How much do you
[55:30] believe actually in that vision that you
[55:32] have for yourself in in that channel and
[55:34] the same is true for Bitcoin. The people
[55:36] that are fearful when Bitcoin goes down
[55:39] from a K to 80K those are the people
[55:42] that don't understand the fundamentals
[55:43] of Bitcoin. they are not really sure is
[55:47] it actually working out and then they
[55:49] listen to Jeff Boo uh they listen to
[55:51] Michael Sailor and then they are getting
[55:53] karmic and like okay he says it and it
[55:56] look it sounds really good but they
[55:58] don't really understand it if you need
[56:00] every time Bitcoin crashes and you need
[56:02] a Jeff poof video maybe you need to do a
[56:05] little bit more of education and and
[56:06] listening to Jeff Bof in itself is
[56:08] educational in that sense but if you
[56:10] need that fix you might want to go back
[56:13] and really go back to fundamental
[56:16] fundamental basis. Why does Bitcoin make
[56:18] sense? Why do I believe in Bitcoin? What
[56:20] is my Bitcoin theory? What is my thesis
[56:23] behind that asset? So, everyone that has
[56:26] that downwards feeling of fear is just
[56:29] saying he's insecure about his own
[56:32] thesis. The going up is way more
[56:34] interesting because your external
[56:38] factors also come in. I know that my
[56:40] girlfriend gets still excited when
[56:42] Bitcoin goes up uh in a in a major way.
[56:44] He she also has she also has Bitcoin and
[56:47] she still looks at Bitcoin in euro
[56:50] terms. She's like that's so many euros.
[56:52] So I see in her just an earlier
[56:55] Bitcoiner that that is earlier stage and
[56:57] doesn't understand it so deeply. And
[56:59] there I can see especially on the upward
[57:02] trend uh where she gets really excited
[57:04] and like oh like we're doing great. And
[57:06] and that's why I said it in the
[57:08] beginning. If you feel bad on the if you
[57:12] feel really good when Bitcoin goes up,
[57:15] you you will feel really bad if Bitcoin
[57:17] goes down. And that's an emotional
[57:20] connection to an asset to a financial
[57:23] asset. And emotions are usually not good
[57:26] in in finance. That that's that are my
[57:28] that are my thoughts. So on the
[57:30] downwards moves, I'm I'm usually not
[57:32] that sad. Upwards move, I'm not that
[57:34] excited. But unfortunately also the
[57:37] Bitcoin price is is now coinciding a
[57:39] little bit with my YouTube views and
[57:41] there I'm still a little bit fearful. So
[57:43] I I have my my emotions now because of
[57:45] YouTube. And what about with uh family
[57:48] and friends? So obviously Bitcoin is a
[57:51] massive part of your life, your career,
[57:54] your net worth is intrinsically linked
[57:57] to the the Bitcoin. How is it affected?
[58:00] How does it affect your family and
[58:02] friends? The closer you are to the sun,
[58:04] the prowner you get, the so so so the
[58:07] closer people are to me, the the more
[58:09] they understand Bitcoin and the more
[58:11] they have Bitcoin. The Bitcoin
[58:13] allocation can actually you could
[58:15] actually make a chart of who I spend
[58:16] most time with in my family and who has
[58:19] the most Bitcoin. It's probably a very
[58:21] coinciding uh and it's also great to see
[58:24] that for example my cousin who also
[58:26] helps me sometimes with the YouTube
[58:27] channel um has has I'm very close with
[58:31] him uh and he's now orange billing his
[58:34] sister and and goes about in this family
[58:37] so it is I have a very big family so
[58:41] most of my family is still unaware of
[58:43] Bitcoin and still thinks it's bad for
[58:45] the environment it still thinks it's
[58:46] risky still thinks it is volatile and
[58:48] all those
[58:50] But the the people that are close to me
[58:52] like family like my mom, dad, my cousin,
[58:55] my sister and stuff like that, they are
[58:57] coming closer and closer to like why
[58:59] Bitcoin and why it's matter and they
[59:01] have some and stuff like that. On the
[59:02] flip side, I have a huge family that are
[59:07] unaware of Bitcoin. They are aware that
[59:10] I'm in Bitcoin. Some of them think, oh,
[59:12] he's young. He's doing his he's doing
[59:15] his thing. he will grow up and then he
[59:17] will do something that adults do and not
[59:19] this kids toy with Bitcoin. I think some
[59:22] probably think like that. Then others
[59:24] think like okay this Bitcoin thing is
[59:26] interesting but why are you only
[59:28] focusing Bitcoin isn't crypto on
[59:30] blockchain the innovation and not
[59:32] Bitcoin. That's a that's a hard one
[59:33] always. So the further out I go and the
[59:37] less time I spend with them the less
[59:39] they know about Bitcoin obviously. And
[59:41] there's one thing also in there with
[59:42] with orange pilling. If you want to
[59:44] orange pill someone, you usually want to
[59:46] orange pill them because you actually
[59:48] like them. You want to show them Bitcoin
[59:50] and you care about them. Because if I
[59:52] don't care about a person, like why
[59:53] would I waste my time on orange billing
[59:55] that person? Because it's also really
[59:57] hard
[59:58] process. If you care about someone and
[60:00] you want do them to understand Bitcoin,
[60:02] it's sometimes hard because uh they are
[60:05] at one 2% of Bitcoin understanding and
[60:09] you are at let's say 80% or 75% of
[60:12] Bitcoin understanding uh and you want to
[60:15] get them to 75% in one day but maybe
[60:18] it's the better strategy to take them
[60:20] from 1% to 2% from 2% to three and four
[60:23] and and slowly move them up the ladder
[60:26] uh and make them understand small things
[60:28] about Bitcoin every time you you meet
[60:31] them. So the understanding of Bitcoin in
[60:34] my family grew over time. I was the
[60:36] first person in my family, in my huge
[60:38] family uh that even talked about that
[60:41] topic and it gets to be a bigger and
[60:44] bigger topic within my family. Nobody is
[60:47] really upset. Nobody hates on Bitcoin.
[60:50] Some have in my opinion stupid opinions
[60:52] around Bitcoin. But they are also
[60:54] getting educated. They're also getting
[60:57] smarter and smarter on Bitcoin.
[61:00] And you're a much younger man than me.
[61:03] I'll state the uh the obvious for those
[61:05] that are looking on video, but have you
[61:07] given any thought yet to what your
[61:10] legacy might be, what your ultimate
[61:13] plans are for your Bitcoin when maybe
[61:15] when you're no longer here? Short answer
[61:17] is no. Currently, I have a plan in place
[61:19] if something happens to me. But I just
[61:21] have a plan in place. So, so I have
[61:23] something but this is not something I I
[61:25] spend a lot of time thinking on that
[61:27] even though it can happen any minute
[61:29] like uh it's it's not just people not
[61:32] not only die because they're old they
[61:33] also die because things happen in life
[61:35] and and life happens to them. So it is
[61:38] something that Bitcoiners should care
[61:40] more about what happens with the
[61:41] Bitcoin. If they are either dead or
[61:44] maybe even have a disability, maybe
[61:46] their brain is no longer working as it
[61:49] used to be. you can come in an accident
[61:51] and and something happens. So think
[61:53] about those kind of situations and and
[61:56] how
[61:57] you would go about that. That's I think
[61:59] a very important topic and uh I think
[62:03] not enough Bitcoiners actually have
[62:05] fought through what if I'm do do I
[62:09] really want my Bitcoin to be locked away
[62:11] forever and give that those Bitcoin to
[62:13] everyone else? It's a fine thing to do.
[62:16] Um but not for everyone. Uh and if you
[62:18] want to do that, do it intentionally and
[62:21] not just because you're lazy. Yeah,
[62:23] absolutely. That that is good thing. Uh
[62:26] and the legacy is less about Bitcoin and
[62:29] more about why I'm documenting publicly
[62:32] uh around everything. Uh that's why I
[62:34] have my YouTube channel. That's why I'm
[62:36] talking a lot on podcasts and on the
[62:38] internet. In that way, even if I die
[62:41] early, um, everyone, including my kids,
[62:44] including I don't have kids right now,
[62:46] but including my future kids, including
[62:48] my girlfriend, including my parents,
[62:51] including all of my cousins, if they
[62:54] really want to, they can spend an hour
[62:56] with me on YouTube and they can listen
[62:59] to a podcast. Uh, and this is something
[63:03] really really beautiful. uh which is now
[63:06] a new thing because your grandpa was
[63:09] probably not on YouTube. But if he was
[63:13] on YouTube and you have hours of
[63:16] materials to listen to him and his
[63:18] wisdom and his
[63:20] um insights on life, how amazing would
[63:23] it be to listen to that even half a year
[63:26] or a year later when he's gone? So this
[63:29] is something I'm more doing because of
[63:32] legacy. So that's why coming back to the
[63:35] YouTube fear example, even if everyone
[63:38] would stop watching my channels, I would
[63:41] still produce in some capacity videos
[63:45] just so when I die, people have
[63:49] something to look for. My wife has
[63:51] something to like, oh, I can I can see
[63:53] him one last time. I I didn't like the
[63:56] last memory. I I have him somewhere. Uh
[63:59] I can spend two hours with him on this
[64:01] podcast. my kids and grandkids and and
[64:03] stuff like that. So, I I think more
[64:05] about legacy in in that way. But
[64:07] overall, I I don't I don't spend too
[64:09] many minutes of the days thinking about
[64:12] that. It's just something that motivates
[64:14] me even more to produce content. I think
[64:18] that's a that's a really balanced
[64:20] answer. I like that a lot. Um, where do
[64:22] you think most Bitcoin is sit between
[64:26] the requirement for number go up for
[64:29] their own wealth and future prosperity
[64:33] versus the real world adoption of
[64:35] Bitcoin. So rather than it just going up
[64:38] so that if you you know the Bitcoin you
[64:41] have is worth more money which means you
[64:42] could buy more things if you want to or
[64:44] retire earlier or secure your financial
[64:47] future versus how much Bitcoin becomes
[64:50] more widely adopted in in the
[64:51] mainstream. It's probably somewhere
[64:54] between 95 and 97% of all Bitcoiners
[64:57] only care about number go technology. Do
[65:00] you think it's that high really? Yes.
[65:02] Because most Bitcoiners aren't on
[65:06] podcasts or on Twitter. Most Bitcoiners
[65:09] only have Bitcoin in in some wallet and
[65:11] they listen to maybe one two podcasts in
[65:13] their whole life and they have Bitcoin
[65:14] and they see it as a diversifier. They
[65:17] see it in one thing as a in their
[65:19] portfolio.
[65:21] We, everyone that is watching here and
[65:24] everyone that is on podcasts, those are
[65:27] that weird one to 3% inside the Bitcoin
[65:30] community that actually cares what
[65:34] happens to Bitcoin long term and is
[65:37] willing to defend Bitcoin. How many how
[65:40] many nodes are there
[65:42] fully run? Like a few 10,00ands. Yeah,
[65:46] that's not a lot. that that's not even
[65:48] close to 1% of all the bitcoiners that
[65:51] are out there. How many people actually
[65:53] have a hardware wallet? Uh Treasure put
[65:55] out last year a statistic where they say
[65:59] only uh two no only 3% of every
[66:03] bitcoiner has a hardware wallet. The
[66:06] rest doesn't have even a hardware
[66:07] wallet. How to do the self custody? I
[66:10] mean you can self custody without a
[66:12] hardware wallet. Yes, but most people
[66:14] don't do it that way.
[66:16] So most people only care about number
[66:19] crop technology and only a very few
[66:22] handful of people truly with their
[66:26] action and with their words care about
[66:30] the freedom co-op technology around
[66:32] Bitcoin and that's fine. Jeff poof
[66:35] actually shared that with me yesterday.
[66:37] I I asked actually quite similar
[66:39] different question but a quite similar
[66:41] question. goes in a similar thing um
[66:44] where he also said it's it's if you only
[66:48] care about namop technology you can be
[66:50] bought you can be if you're a podcaster
[66:54] that just cares about namop technology
[66:56] black can pay you a an amount and you
[67:01] say whatever they want you to say in the
[67:03] podcast but there's that 2 to 3% uh and
[67:07] he made some studies around that 2 to 3%
[67:10] that cannot be bought in a revolution
[67:12] that two to 3% that no matter what black
[67:15] rogue comes to them and say like this is
[67:17] the amount I'm paying you please report
[67:20] promote that fork or whatever they are
[67:23] not being bought and in bitcoin we do
[67:27] have that we do have that hardcore line
[67:30] of people that say this is our freedom
[67:34] technology and we won't take the
[67:36] shortcut we saw that in the block size
[67:38] war where the mining industry was for
[67:41] bigger blocks. Uh Roger Ver big uh
[67:45] Bitcoiners were for bigger blocks. I
[67:47] mean Roger
[67:49] Ver he he was the Bitcoin Jesus before
[67:53] the block size war. He was on a path to
[67:56] be one of the greatest of all time in
[67:59] Bitcoin. He would have had more Bitcoin
[68:01] than Michael Sailor right now. He he
[68:03] could have been the keynote speaker on
[68:05] every big Bitcoin um uh event out there
[68:10] at any time, but he choses to go down
[68:14] not the freedom go up technology but the
[68:17] number go up technology route as I would
[68:20] say it. And with that he lost. And I
[68:25] think we see how Bitcoin rewards truth
[68:29] and rewards those people who stay true
[68:31] to the real revolution of Bitcoin. And
[68:34] this is something really beautiful to
[68:36] see that there is a hardcore user base
[68:40] that actually cares about Bitcoin and is
[68:43] not blinded by fancy objects like a
[68:47] Roger V that was a Bitcoin Jesus that
[68:49] was for bigger blocks. the whole mining
[68:51] industry that the industry really moved
[68:53] towards bigger blocks. People that
[68:54] didn't live through that and I didn't
[68:56] live through that but I read a lot and I
[68:58] talked with a lot of people around that
[69:00] topic. They did not understand how big
[69:03] the shift between two bigger blocks were
[69:05] but the hardcore block said no that's
[69:08] destroying decentralization and the
[69:10] security and they stayed in that line.
[69:13] this made Bitcoin really strong and this
[69:16] is the people that run full notes the
[69:18] the users of Bitcoin that made that
[69:20] decision and I think that's the
[69:22] important part and for anyone that wants
[69:25] to read about that there's like a book
[69:26] out there block size war and there are
[69:29] multiple uh documentations around that
[69:31] be aware there's also a lot of uh BS out
[69:34] there with Bitcoin cashers and the how
[69:37] do they call Bitcoin Satoshi vision
[69:39] there are a lot of they are sales
[69:40] persons out there that try to sell you
[69:42] on in different story. But if if you
[69:44] really dig deep in what happened there,
[69:47] you will see how profound that shift was
[69:50] and how important that was for the
[69:53] Bitcoin story. I even remember I think
[69:55] Michael Sailor talking about that he
[69:58] thinks that the team block size war was
[70:01] the moment where Bitcoin proved to be
[70:04] resilient enough to be a good asset. He
[70:08] said like before that it was not clear
[70:10] and after that it was clear how
[70:11] resilient Bitcoin is. Yeah, that's it's
[70:14] really interesting. Um this is a bit off
[70:17] topic but what do you think the worst
[70:19] thing about Bitcoin is? If you had to
[70:21] had to to say what you think Yeah.
[70:23] simply that what's the worst thing you
[70:25] think there is about Bitcoin?
[70:27] That your
[70:28] enemy can also buy Bitcoin. That's the
[70:31] worst thing. It's it's open for
[70:32] everyone. It's Black Rockck can buy
[70:34] Bitcoin. Nation states can buy Bitcoin.
[70:37] your competitor can buy Bitcoin and they
[70:39] have a strategic and game theory
[70:41] advantage with buying Bitcoin and your
[70:44] enemy is getting bigger with that. So
[70:46] don't tell your enemy about Bitcoin.
[70:48] That's that's literally the worst thing
[70:49] about Bitcoin. Uh open uh for for for
[70:53] your enemy and everything else is is
[70:56] that's the best thing I ever heard that
[70:58] that's bad for Bitcoin. Everything else
[71:00] is actually kind of kind of good better
[71:02] than anything else. Yeah. Although even
[71:05] though that I understand that angle that
[71:07] it's the worst things your enemies can
[71:09] over but in one sense that's also one of
[71:11] the positives of Bitcoin is it is
[71:13] apolitical it does not care about who
[71:16] you are how rich you are how poor you
[71:18] are what language you speak what country
[71:20] you're from Bitcoin is for everyone so
[71:23] on one hand that's amazing on the other
[71:27] it's one of the worst things because it
[71:28] gives access to everyone yeah it gives
[71:31] access to everyone and you don't have a
[71:32] privilege no matter who who you are,
[71:35] where you're born. When you're born in
[71:36] Austria as a tall white dude, you have
[71:40] some advantages, but Bitcoin doesn't
[71:41] care about that. I'm 2 years, but
[71:43] Bitcoin doesn't care about that. All the
[71:45] advantages or the the human capital and
[71:48] the things that we as as as persons have
[71:52] that are advantages or disadvantages
[71:54] that put in society in different
[71:56] categories. Bitcoin has no clue about
[71:58] that. It's it's just open source code.
[72:01] Uh, and it's so funny when people say
[72:03] like, "Oh, Bitcoin is rightwing." And
[72:05] I'm like, "How can an opensource code be
[72:10] rightwing?" And open source code doesn't
[72:12] even know what rightwing means. And open
[72:15] source code only knows the things that
[72:17] are programmed in there. And there's no
[72:21] right-wing variable in that code. No.
[72:24] Absolutely. Or leftwing or centrist. It
[72:27] is. Yeah. It's apolitical. Completely
[72:30] neutral. It's it's it's absolut and it's
[72:33] it's interesting how Trump got into it
[72:36] and it was very loud about it and and
[72:39] Harris and Biden a little bit less loud
[72:41] but they are still got more positive
[72:44] towards the end of the election. But
[72:46] there's also a big group like the the
[72:48] progressive for for Bitcoin. Uh there's
[72:51] a big group around also how how was it
[72:54] called? Bitcoiners for Harris. I
[72:56] remember there was a group like that
[72:57] that were actually already on my my
[72:59] channel. So for everyone that is on the
[73:02] right side of the aisle, there's someone
[73:04] that is on the left side of the aisle
[73:06] also likes Bitcoin. So it's it's we we
[73:10] have the tendency to put our values onto
[73:14] Bitcoin and think every Bitcoiner has to
[73:18] think like that because we are like that
[73:20] and we are Bitcoiner. So every Bitcoin
[73:22] has to be the same. That's why people
[73:24] say, and we talked about that before,
[73:26] that there's a certain type of
[73:28] Bitcoiner, like he eats meat, he works
[73:30] out, he he does that. Yeah, that might
[73:33] be actually good things like working out
[73:34] and stuff like that and eating good, but
[73:36] not every Bitcoin is like that. There's
[73:38] a lot of vegans, plant-based people
[73:41] within Bitcoin. I've meet I met a lot of
[73:44] them. Actually, I myself enjoy
[73:46] plant-based food a lot. Honestly, I do
[73:49] eat also meat. So it's you cannot say
[73:52] Bitcoiners only eat meat. That's that's
[73:54] a ridiculous thing to say. You're just
[73:56] portraying your values on the Bitcoin
[73:59] and think that's the standard someone
[74:01] else has to meet to be a Bitcoiner.
[74:03] That's why when you said before, what is
[74:06] a Bitcoiner? A Bitcoiner is a person who
[74:09] uses
[74:10] Bitcoin. That that's it. That's the
[74:13] qualifier. Yeah. Everything else is your
[74:16] own opinion or defi definition of what a
[74:19] Bitcoiner needs to be, but it's not
[74:21] true. Yeah. No, that's great. The final
[74:25] question is one I ask all my guests,
[74:27] which is, what's one belief you held
[74:29] before Bitcoin that you've completely
[74:31] changed your mind about? Funny enough, I
[74:32] have changed politically a lot. One
[74:35] belief, it's it's funny. Before I answer
[74:37] that, I have to uh give give an
[74:40] disclaimer and think maybe I had
[74:44] yesterday free podcast so it's it's
[74:45] sometimes hard to think like did and
[74:48] talk with you about that or with the
[74:49] other two but I talked about that
[74:50] yesterday. Um I went through my uh
[74:53] Bitcoin story now I'm 26 started being
[74:57] in Bitcoin with 21 years old and I
[74:59] actually heard about Bitcoin even
[75:01] earlier than that. between 21 years old
[75:03] and 26 years old, there's a lot of
[75:04] development happening with or without
[75:06] Bitcoin. So, it's always hard to say,
[75:08] okay, what were the beliefs with 20
[75:11] years old that are now no longer share
[75:14] um that changed a lot. It can be because
[75:17] of Bitcoin, but it can also just very
[75:20] well be because I got 5 years older and
[75:23] especially
[75:25] uh from 35 to 40 uh there's probably
[75:27] less development or less radical changes
[75:30] in your life than from 21 years old to
[75:33] to 26 years old. With that being said, I
[75:37] changed a lot
[75:39] around I think dating probably is the
[75:43] the the biggest thing that changed with
[75:48] 20 years old. I was dating around. I
[75:51] didn't want to commit to one girl. I
[75:54] just wanted I I had that stupid belief
[75:57] that you are not free if you have a
[75:59] girlfriend and I wanted to be as free as
[76:02] possible. That might be a solid opinion
[76:04] with 20 years old. It might not be the
[76:07] worst thing to to think if you if you're
[76:09] young and and want to have fun. And that
[76:12] changed drastically uh drastically
[76:14] within the last two to three years. I
[76:17] found actually having a committed
[76:19] relationship and having to commit to
[76:22] someone fully frees you completely. All
[76:26] of the sudden I don't think about girls
[76:29] anymore. I have my girl and she's the
[76:32] center of my attention and with
[76:34] everything else I can focus on building
[76:36] a great f future for the both of us and
[76:40] this is something that completely and we
[76:43] can go very deep into the topic actually
[76:45] but this is something where I I changed
[76:48] a lot and I think it's also the the
[76:50] Bitcoiner way when you think about fiat
[76:54] it's it's about shortterm and and time
[76:57] preference and I think it also change if
[77:01] we change our time preference and if we
[77:03] change our sound money, it will also
[77:05] change our relationships. The feared
[77:07] mindset is I'm going into the bar and
[77:11] trying to hook up with a girl and I will
[77:13] dump her tomorrow. That's very feared. I
[77:18] that's a hookup society. Your standard
[77:21] for that is very low. If you go into any
[77:24] bar and your only standard is, I want to
[77:28] have sex with her tonight and I don't
[77:31] want to see her again
[77:33] afterwards. Yeah, like 80% of women
[77:36] probably fit that description. Maybe
[77:38] 70%. But if your standard in a Bitcoin
[77:42] mindset is I want to spend, I might want
[77:45] to find a woman in that bar, but I I
[77:50] don't have to find a woman in that bar.
[77:52] and your standard is I want to
[77:54] potentially be the rest of my life with
[77:57] that one
[77:58] person. All of the sudden this flips.
[78:01] All of the sudden maybe 10% of the women
[78:03] that you meet there might even be a
[78:05] candidate or maybe like 5% only. Maybe
[78:08] you you look around you talk to them and
[78:10] you're like none of them is good enough.
[78:12] Your standard all of the sudden raises a
[78:14] lot. This is something is not just about
[78:17] broken money obviously, but broken money
[78:20] plays a role into hookup culture and
[78:23] young boys being like, I I just want to
[78:25] hook up with a lot of girls. And this
[78:27] this is not me saying like you have to
[78:29] commit to the first girl you meet. Not
[78:32] at all. I've I've went
[78:34] through now four girlfriends in my life
[78:36] and I'm just 26. So you can make the
[78:39] calculations how long they they lasted.
[78:42] But it's now the first time ever that
[78:44] I've been in a relationship where I
[78:47] think not like great we made another
[78:49] month. No, like I want to make the next
[78:51] 100 years with you. I want to build an
[78:54] empire with you. I want to do something
[78:56] with you very long term. And this is
[78:59] probably the biggest thing that has
[79:02] changed in in the period of time where I
[79:06] adopted
[79:07] Bitcoin. It's probably not just because
[79:09] of Bitcoin. is probably also just
[79:11] growing up. But I do think that Bitcoin
[79:14] impacts our relationships.
[79:17] Wow, I love that answer. I suspect no
[79:19] one else will say that. That's uh yeah,
[79:21] that's that's great. Um okay, I'm really
[79:23] conscious of your time, Robin. I've
[79:25] really enjoyed our conversation and
[79:26] again, thanks so much for for coming on.
[79:29] This was great. I enjoyed it a lot and
[79:31] you're a great podcast host. Uh I assume
[79:33] I will see you more often on YouTube
[79:35] now. I hope so.
