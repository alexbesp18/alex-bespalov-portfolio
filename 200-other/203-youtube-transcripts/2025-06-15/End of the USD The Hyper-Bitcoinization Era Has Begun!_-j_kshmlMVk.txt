[00:00] I found Bitcoin as the most effective
[00:02] tool for Liberation to bring freedom to
[00:05] the world I noticed that what actually
[00:07] brings the most freedom is technology we
[00:09] love to discuss manger or hyek and we
[00:12] might be right about free market but I
[00:14] didn't see that many real world examples
[00:17] coming out of these ideas while Bitcoin
[00:19] seems to be like the pure manifestation
[00:21] of them the more people use
[00:23] uncontrollable money in their daily life
[00:25] as their method of savings as their
[00:27] medium of exchange they less mon control
[00:30] the government will have over us at the
[00:32] end of this road there lies a hyper
[00:34] Bitcoin ised Society where government
[00:36] simply cannot Finance anything unless
[00:39] they ask their citizens to government
[00:40] will need to be trimmed down to
[00:42] Necessary
[00:43] [Music]
[00:47] Things what are you actually doing at uh
[00:49] at at Al you're doing like you're
[00:51] working full-time in Bitcoin at Al from
[00:53] what I understand I work at Albi
[00:56] parttime uh I do I know you can call it
[01:00] marketing anything that is user facing
[01:02] but also some Partnerships with projects
[01:06] that we cooperate with so I'm on this
[01:08] side of the team uh there is we have uh
[01:12] quite a few good deps ux designer I'm
[01:15] also helping a support team there is one
[01:17] person at a support team uh yeah you
[01:20] know you know how it is that it's still
[01:22] a startup we are small team eight nine
[01:24] people so basically you do uh everything
[01:28] that that is helpful for the project
[01:32] tasks yeah but you work fulltime with
[01:36] Bitcoin stuff like you you only do
[01:38] Bitcoin or do you have some other jobs
[01:39] next it no no no no not a job not jobs I
[01:42] have some projects right on my own but
[01:45] uh most of them are Bitcoin related yes
[01:48] and
[01:50] uh yeah no ALB is my job and the other
[01:53] are like you know site projects or gigs
[01:55] or something that I plan running
[01:59] interest
[02:00] how did you get involved in so many bit
[02:03] Bitcoin things like how did you get
[02:04] involved with working in
[02:06] Bitcoin
[02:08] uh I like most of my recent life I've
[02:12] been like on Project base freelance
[02:15] somewhere and I've been um a Libertarian
[02:19] activist for for many years I still
[02:21] consider myself I am uh so then when I
[02:24] discovered Bitcoin and got orange pilled
[02:27] this libertarian Freedom activism here
[02:30] in Poland turned into Bitcoin activism
[02:33] so I helped translate and publish some
[02:36] sain books I organized local meetups in
[02:39] waro I
[02:42] ranched Community here in Poland uh I
[02:46] organized Bitcoin
[02:47] filmfest uh that's that that's how also
[02:50] through I think through Bitcoin filmfest
[02:51] and through some mutual friends I got in
[02:53] touch with Alby who at the time uh where
[02:56] I had some uh spare uh resources SP
[03:00] Spare Time on my own uh they reached out
[03:02] to me and we got in touch that yeah
[03:05] there is a match I could join a team so
[03:07] I meant I'll be at since uh one and a
[03:10] half year yes I mean
[03:14] uh I'm I'm I'm in Bitcoin I'm interested
[03:17] in Bitcoin uh because I'm interested in
[03:20] Freedom because this is this is kind of
[03:22] my one of my crucial values that I
[03:25] pursue in life uh if there would if I
[03:28] would find the better tool to heal money
[03:31] than Bitcoin I would probably be you
[03:34] know Bitcoin maximalism is not Bitcoin
[03:37] ultimate maximalism there is a reason
[03:39] why at least me uh are advocating for
[03:42] Bitcoin and my reason there is there is
[03:44] many reasons but the uh core one is I
[03:47] guess freedom I always cared about
[03:50] Freedom Independence autonomy in my life
[03:53] and also in in the world around me
[03:57] because I I like to see world full of
[04:00] life and the diversity and where people
[04:03] are honest and uh doing the actions that
[04:06] they want to do and can do so uh most of
[04:11] my adult life uh I run an libertarian
[04:14] NGO called Center of capitalism in
[04:16] Poland where every two years with my
[04:19] friends we organize the biggest such
[04:22] conference in Poland called weekend of
[04:24] capitalism next one is coming this may
[04:27] in
[04:28] Warsaw uh and dur you know running this
[04:32] NGO I've been involved in very many like
[04:34] smaller projects publishing some books
[04:36] organizing some economic
[04:39] seminars we opened a bar called Freedom
[04:41] Lounge in waro which you can still visit
[04:44] it's it's right in the center of waro
[04:46] it's libertarian themed uh I worked in
[04:49] some publishing agencies so most of my
[04:53] jobs over the last jobs and projects
[04:55] over the last 10 years were Freedom
[04:57] related I became very well networked
[05:00] within kind of libertarian movement
[05:03] locally and uh internationally so it
[05:06] also I can use this as a leverage in my
[05:08] projects and yeah this is I guess how my
[05:11] career went but it's uh I'm very
[05:14] satisfied with it because this is where
[05:17] uh currently my skills are but since
[05:20] childhood I guess my heart
[05:23] is interesting I also I I talked about
[05:26] that a lot of on the podcast I I I
[05:29] consider myself a Bitcoin maximalist but
[05:32] only because I am a free market
[05:35] maximalist and I think in a free market
[05:37] Bitcoin will win and we have a free
[05:39] market and uh that's why I don't see any
[05:43] other options I don't see feeld as an
[05:45] option I don't see altcoins as an option
[05:47] and I I'm purely focused on bitcoin not
[05:51] because I'm in love with Bitcoin but I'm
[05:53] in love with the free market and Bitcoin
[05:56] um represents all those values for me
[06:00] uh uh so I think it it it's more around
[06:03] that topic so in a sense it's just like
[06:06] how you phrase it but uh do you think
[06:09] that in addition to that that Bitcoin is
[06:11] kind of enforcing more capitalism more
[06:14] liberalism more more free market onto
[06:17] our world because it's like the it's
[06:21] like a force like a train that's coming
[06:23] our way and it's not not leaving any
[06:25] anyways uh precisely yes uh I found
[06:30] Bitcoin as simply the most the most
[06:33] effective uh tool for Liberation uh as
[06:37] to speak to bring freedom to the world
[06:40] you know doing this uh conferences
[06:42] seminars demonstrations uh some
[06:44] political activism uh bars uh lounges in
[06:49] Poland over the years I came to
[06:52] unfortunately not very optimistic
[06:54] conclusion that uh most of uh stuff that
[06:58] I do that we do in as let's call it
[07:01] libertarian movement they are not
[07:03] working they don't bring much effects
[07:07] and you know you can spend lots of
[07:09] effort lots of uh human resources and
[07:14] capital into let's say every year
[07:16] organizing an economic seminar where you
[07:19] teach classic economics works of manger
[07:23] mises ha
[07:25] basat every year and you can have
[07:27] hundreds of uh uh
[07:30] very smart students there who might
[07:34] become leaders or activists Etc the
[07:37] effects of such libertarian activism at
[07:39] least in in this in the range that I've
[07:43] experienced the effects are very
[07:45] minuscule the effects can be overwhelmed
[07:48] with the virus with a political reader
[07:52] leader with a Wind of Change uh the
[07:55] effects of educating Society
[07:59] might come they will not for sure come
[08:02] they might come and they might come in
[08:04] five 10 20 years in between those many
[08:07] other things could happen and you just
[08:09] don't see direct consequences of uh of
[08:13] bringing Freedom this way and I noce
[08:15] that what actually brings the most
[08:18] Freedom um is technology I guess that uh
[08:22] you know Uber or Airbnb coming to Poland
[08:25] brought more freedom as in sense of uh
[08:29] Spectre of actions that you could do
[08:31] that you are free to do the uh Spectre
[08:34] of possibilities probably the you know
[08:37] some technological companies or
[08:39] Innovations they brought much more
[08:40] freedom to my world my life and to life
[08:44] of society than any activism that we did
[08:47] with libertarian movement and then when
[08:50] you discover Bitcoin you can see that oh
[08:52] wow this actually uh brings freedom on a
[08:56] personal
[08:57] level you know being interested most of
[09:00] I guess our listeners can can confirm
[09:03] that uh getting interested in Bitcoin
[09:05] gets them interested in libertarian
[09:06] ideas in understanding economics in
[09:09] understanding monetary systems it brings
[09:10] them freedom because uh perhaps they got
[09:13] wealthier by uh uh saving in Bitcoin uh
[09:17] it brings freedom on societal level
[09:21] because uh we are we can use money which
[09:23] is not designed to finance war and which
[09:26] is not financing war and which is not
[09:28] used uh and overused by politics but the
[09:32] money that was designed to bring freedom
[09:34] and is used for uh voluntary
[09:37] interactions between between people who
[09:39] use Bitcoin so um I just find Bitcoin
[09:43] just as a tool that brings the most
[09:46] Freedom out of all other tools that I
[09:49] tried interesting it's I love the Uber
[09:52] example with technology because when you
[09:55] when you look at what Uber has done to
[09:57] the taxi industry
[09:59] they decentralized the market in a way
[10:03] where everyone can be a taxi driver and
[10:06] an Uber driver um they brought
[10:09] transparency in the game uh
[10:11] now previously I don't know how it was
[10:14] uh in Poland or in America or in other
[10:16] place in the world but in Austria you
[10:19] got into the taxi and you got to know
[10:22] how much you pay at the end of the ride
[10:25] with Uber you know it before you even
[10:28] enter the the the the car so they
[10:30] brought transparency in the market
[10:32] you're like okay I will pay that like
[10:34] $20 for that ride I'm not paying that I
[10:36] don't want that and some
[10:39] clity I saw that there is biggest
[10:42] psychological uh comfort that Uber
[10:45] brings is that knowledge that you know
[10:48] up front not only how much you're going
[10:50] to pay but also how long you're going to
[10:53] wait okay now it's I guess it's very
[10:56] often fake that sometimes it tells me oh
[10:57] you will eat three minutes then I start
[10:59] a timer and it's actually you know 8
[11:01] minutes so Uber sometimes maybe lies to
[11:03] me and yes I can understand that but yes
[11:06] this this this type of thing that you
[11:08] don't have to wait that you can book it
[11:09] and then you know put your shoes on and
[11:11] leave this brings lots of psychological
[11:13] Comfort but yes it brings lots of uh uh
[11:16] much more I can I can use taxi much
[11:19] easier much cheaper uh drivers can make
[11:22] money much easier much cheaper there is
[11:23] also lots of other Technologies on the
[11:25] side like credit card payments which
[11:27] also are easier they are not yet that
[11:29] that good as micro payments would are on
[11:32] Lightning Network for example but this
[11:34] is something that was not I guess in
[11:37] poent possible 20 years ago and the
[11:40] phone and then you can see you know
[11:41] there is some Google Maps or some other
[11:43] maps and satellite GPS behind so there
[11:46] is it's not just Uber of course but lots
[11:47] of this techn as a general technology
[11:50] brings freedom and yes Uber is a good
[11:52] example I love that yeah and and one
[11:55] more aspect to to that is the opening up
[11:58] the market like it made um Taxi Driver
[12:02] more accessible it's it's it's it's not
[12:05] permissionless as Bitcoin like Bitcoin
[12:07] is fully permissionless you can use
[12:09] Bitcoin without any any uh gatekeeper so
[12:13] Uber is not completely permissionless
[12:15] because there's like uber in your way
[12:17] but it's way more permissionless than
[12:19] the traditional taxi uh industry so I
[12:23] see a lot of uh and we could go down
[12:26] through like all the technology
[12:28] advancements that we had with
[12:30] electricity with the internet itself
[12:32] with so many different apps that that or
[12:34] like even social media podcasting uh
[12:37] like 20 years ago I had to be a news
[12:39] anchor on some television channel uh now
[12:43] everyone can do it themselves and just
[12:45] go on uh YouTube and open up a show and
[12:48] if you're doing good uh you will be a
[12:51] great hit and you will do really good if
[12:53] you're bad nobody will watch your stuff
[12:55] so so there's like a lot of um uh things
[12:59] happening do that and I I love how
[13:02] Bitcoin brings on the most important
[13:05] base layer money exactly all those
[13:08] permissions transparency
[13:11] decentralization into the game that's
[13:13] that's really fascinating to to look at
[13:14] that yeah because Uber uh that's a good
[13:18] point that Bitcoin is a base layer right
[13:20] for it it brings freedom to whole
[13:23] economic and economic not in terms of
[13:25] you know business but I guess every
[13:27] decision is after all economic decision
[13:30] that it brings us freedom to most of act
[13:33] activities most most of actions that we
[13:35] do in life Uber brings us freedom yes
[13:38] but in the context of getting uh getting
[13:41] getting somewhere or driving someone and
[13:43] making money on it or Airbnb in terms of
[13:46] accommodation yes but Bitcoin being this
[13:49] base
[13:50] of EX any exchange mostly voluntary
[13:54] exchange or money as
[13:56] being uh this base of voluntary Exchange
[13:59] changes and and the medium of of them
[14:02] uh having next generation of this
[14:05] technology uh that is much more free in
[14:08] terms of unability
[14:11] accessibility and and also not being
[14:13] controlled by by basically any one
[14:17] Authority uh it's it's a great
[14:20] advancement uh for you know great bring
[14:24] great uh manifestation of libertarian
[14:27] ideas in the real world because before
[14:30] Bitcoin I I I felt doing this coming
[14:32] back to the ACT libertarian activism I
[14:34] felt like we are in some how maybe Ivory
[14:38] Towers where yes we love to discuss
[14:40] manger or Hayek and we might be right
[14:43] about free market but uh but I didn't
[14:46] see that many uh real world examples or
[14:51] uh practicalities coming out of these
[14:54] ideas while Bitcoin seems to be like the
[14:56] pure manifestation of them for me
[14:59] I think that's a great great thing is
[15:01] it's
[15:02] like you can educate the world as much
[15:05] as you want but in the end of the day
[15:07] you have to
[15:09] incentivize them to to educate
[15:12] themselves in a way and Bitcoin is
[15:14] bringing that incentive in there like
[15:15] Bitcoin is incentivizing people to to to
[15:19] care about those libertarian ideas more
[15:22] because they're forced into they kind of
[15:25] forced into that like it's an
[15:26] interesting idea to think about I don't
[15:28] know if you can educate the whole world
[15:30] on libertarian ideas it's probably
[15:32] easier
[15:34] to bring a
[15:36] free monetary standard that brings those
[15:40] uh libertarian
[15:41] ideas as a give in there like a nature
[15:45] law in there and people then can still
[15:48] talk about socialism and communism and
[15:50] people still uh try to uh put socialism
[15:54] and communism and all the other things
[15:55] on top of Bitcoin um but it will not
[15:58] work as good because it's for all those
[16:02] things you need to control the money and
[16:03] if you cannot control the money you you
[16:06] are in a in a more libertarian and more
[16:10] capitalist Society uh as as I see they
[16:14] could launch communist casum Min and
[16:17] then like issue some tokens on top of
[16:19] Bitcoin which they would have under
[16:20] control uh yeah this the same analogy
[16:24] before Bitcoin we used to have uh in the
[16:26] libertarian movement again that uh you
[16:29] know in capitalist Society it wouldn't
[16:31] be a problem or a free society which
[16:34] is kind of the same you could build a
[16:38] communist uh subgroup you could you
[16:41] could rent some land or loan something
[16:43] or go to mountains you know build your
[16:46] commune even it doesn't have to be on
[16:48] one territory but in communist Society
[16:50] you couldn't you couldn't build a
[16:52] Libertarian uh sub Society in it I mean
[16:55] yeah that's that's the thing with with
[16:58] alins right like everyone tries to to to
[17:00] get to the next Bitcoin like everyone
[17:02] wants to have another Bitcoin uh and and
[17:04] that's why we have now even the
[17:06] president launching a coin of him of his
[17:10] own uh where he has the pre where he
[17:13] controls it um but in the end of the day
[17:16] those things are only temporary there so
[17:20] they they can do that they can try to
[17:22] launch some tokens that they can control
[17:24] but like nobody will care long term
[17:27] shortterm maybe but
[17:29] uh you
[17:30] really if you want to control Society on
[17:34] a Bitcoin standard uh you have to
[17:36] provide value uh which is a huge huge
[17:40] thing do you think there's such like if
[17:42] we actually live on a Bitcoin standard
[17:44] do you think uh oh maybe let's go from a
[17:48] more abstract thing what do you think
[17:50] will change once we move more towards a
[17:54] Bitcoin standard uh and uh the money is
[17:57] kind of free well
[17:59] uh I could only guess but uh one of
[18:05] the biggest potential outcomes that uh
[18:08] is often I would not be original here
[18:11] it's often brought up by bitcoiners is
[18:14] that uh well the more people use Bitcoin
[18:17] it doesn't have to the world doesn't
[18:18] have to be hyper Bitcoin for this to
[18:20] happen but the more people use
[18:23] uncontrollable money in their daily life
[18:27] as their method of saving
[18:29] as their payments medium of exchange the
[18:32] less monetary control the government
[18:35] will have over us and at the end the
[18:38] less the less they could take from us in
[18:41] form of inflation but also in form of
[18:43] Taxation because it's much harder to tax
[18:47] Bitcoin and also at the end of the at
[18:51] the end of this road there lies a hyper
[18:53] Bitcoin IED Society where governments
[18:56] simply cannot Finance anything unless
[18:59] they ask uh their citizens to uh it
[19:01] could be taxation or it could be maybe
[19:04] some voluntary payments but uh either
[19:07] way uh
[19:09] today basically by giving government
[19:12] control over money and its distribution
[19:16] we allow them to finance whatever they
[19:19] want and for how much they want and at
[19:22] the end of this road where uh there
[19:24] hopefully would not be people people
[19:27] would not use this shitty government
[19:30] money the government to go for a war or
[19:33] to finance some great fiveyear social
[19:37] welfare project they cannot just Finance
[19:40] it and then asks for payments later in
[19:42] forms of I don't know big credits so
[19:46] let's simplify it to money printing they
[19:48] would need to convince their people that
[19:51] hey we have this project we want to go
[19:53] for a war or we want to build this huge
[19:56] educational facility let's cheap in
[19:59] there wouldn't be any other option
[20:01] unless maybe government makes money
[20:02] somewhere but then making money on a
[20:04] free market it doesn't make it different
[20:07] than being a company so I guess we don't
[20:11] have to call it government if it's if
[20:13] it's not somehow monopolistic in forms
[20:15] of uh well today in lots of forms but at
[20:20] the end of the road we by triming down
[20:23] the usage of Fiat government money we
[20:25] will trim down the possibilities of
[20:27] actions that government can Finance with
[20:30] it with a control of this money so uh at
[20:33] the end of this road again on hyper
[20:36] binize government will need to be
[20:38] trimmed down to necessary things and I
[20:40] believe those necessary things are uh
[20:42] the well institutional use of
[20:44] retributory force some you know police
[20:47] some uh Army to protect from uh outside
[20:52] uh uh enemies uh and some Judiciary
[20:56] System you don't need uh a monopoly over
[20:58] anything else uh to have healthy society
[21:02] and I believe Bitcoin brings it uh it
[21:05] doesn't bring it only uh when we already
[21:08] when we achieve the hyperbitcoinization
[21:29] uh for some people maybe not uh the
[21:32] tempo of these changes might not be
[21:36] satisfactory but it's for sure much
[21:39] faster than uh bringing this change by
[21:42] convincing Society to vote for uh
[21:45] Freedom oriented politicians it's in a
[21:48] in a way you get to have governments
[21:52] that are more service based like you pay
[21:55] for the security that the government
[21:57] provides against Other Nation States uh
[22:01] and less for like like let's just
[22:03] collect taxes and we will tell you
[22:05] afterwards what we use those taxes like
[22:08] you you just pay uh like capital gains
[22:10] tax you just pay income tax and you're
[22:12] like but what what are the actually
[22:14] doing with that money um you don't know
[22:18] uh you so so so so you basically saying
[22:22] we get more towards um government
[22:24] actually have to show us we need that
[22:28] money to build out that security project
[22:30] we need to get get that money to to make
[22:34] that road thing going like we we get
[22:36] more towards a service based uh
[22:40] government or maybe like private
[22:42] institutions or something like
[22:44] that to to today don't even ask right
[22:48] Trump just does you know executive order
[22:51] executive order changing his own
[22:53] decisions and people are complaining
[22:55] that look at look at Trump he's silly
[22:57] and what do he do no it's it's not
[23:00] specifically him someone else would
[23:02] would do it and they do it they have
[23:04] done it it's the system that is flawed
[23:06] and if we give to one person or
[23:08] institution or group such power or
[23:11] basically any power which is not given
[23:14] voluntarily by citizens it will be
[23:16] overused and uh sometimes it might be
[23:18] overused to such comical levels uh yeah
[23:22] let's hope this this this will end soon
[23:25] maybe not in my lifetime but I at least
[23:27] enjoy fighting for it and yes
[23:30] personally Bitcoin brings Freedom also
[23:33] on personal level even if I don't think
[23:35] about Society it gives me some ability
[23:39] to I know hide my wealth to to grow my
[23:42] wealth to to keep it without I or
[23:45] control of
[23:46] government uh yeah it's uh you know many
[23:51] people say that uh to what what what you
[23:55] brought that uh people because of
[23:58] Bitcoin get interested in uh in some you
[24:01] know the way economy works or state
[24:04] works or even asks ask this important
[24:06] questions what is State what is money
[24:08] and that's great people may maybe their
[24:11] motive at the beginning and I guess for
[24:13] most of them is is some Financial gains
[24:16] so they come for gain and stay for the
[24:18] revolution which is good right it's good
[24:20] that they stay for the revolution if
[24:22] they stay for gains maybe they should go
[24:25] somewhere else and to this Trump coins
[24:27] or Melania coins probably those there is
[24:30] also some funnel of people who become
[24:32] interested who get interested in you
[24:34] know trumpcoin and then they like oh
[24:36] it's a money I can use it as money let's
[24:39] let's ask myself this question let's
[24:41] let's be interested more and maybe they
[24:42] come eventually to bitcoin and and stay
[24:45] for the revolution uh I came for the
[24:47] revolution I'm staying for the
[24:49] revolution I don't see much many Gams
[24:53] yet but this is this is not the goal
[24:55] here interesting yeah like so so you
[24:58] came into Bitcoin for for the revolution
[25:01] so yeah I mean that's that's what I said
[25:03] I was for the revolution before uh
[25:05] before Bitcoin and before I discover
[25:06] Bitcoin uh and I heard of it like 2013
[25:10] in some local war of libertarian meetups
[25:13] somebody was giving away paper wallets
[25:16] like you know printed private keys on on
[25:20] on paper sheets uh I was like oh yeah
[25:23] this is finally this this is it like Hy
[25:27] was writing about this in
[25:28] nationalization or denationalization of
[25:30] money like this is a Libertarian dream
[25:32] we want money not control enough and the
[25:34] FED that that was also the popular even
[25:37] in Poland U at least for in our group of
[25:40] 12 people uh statement uh so yes I was
[25:44] here for the revolution uh then I
[25:47] discovered Bitcoin I forgot about it I
[25:49] didn't understand that this this
[25:51] actually works right like oh this is a
[25:53] this is a dream of some computer geeks
[25:55] who are Libertarians then it took me
[25:57] another few years to like like why
[26:00] I was doing all this seminars and
[26:03] political demonstrations uh while the
[26:06] most efficient tool to bring freedom is
[26:10] well a bit omitted by libertarian
[26:12] movement I I feel a bit disappointed
[26:14] with it and uh I'm happy to see that
[26:17] actually bitcoiners become more
[26:19] libertarian IED more they become more
[26:22] interested in Freedom then Libertarians
[26:24] are becoming interested in Bitcoin but I
[26:26] guess it doesn't matter now um Bitcoin
[26:29] does its job uh for whatever your uh
[26:33] background ideas are uh and uh so far it
[26:37] looks like it's it's doing its job in
[26:40] the direction of Freedom so uh yes happy
[26:43] to discover this tool it's already been
[26:46] I don't know maybe four years maybe five
[26:48] that I can consider myself a Bitcoin or
[26:50] that I I you know fall down the rabbit
[26:52] hole and keep
[26:53] digging but yes the revolution uh was
[26:57] for me earlier uh but I guess only with
[26:59] Bitcoin it really uh uh I I I regained
[27:03] hope that uh it could be successful
[27:06] because for the moment I kind of lost it
[27:08] love that it's like the most efficient
[27:10] way to push freedom is to push Bitcoin
[27:14] that that is kind of what I'm getting is
[27:16] uh I guess on the doesn't have to be
[27:19] Bitcoin right but the technology I saw
[27:21] the technology is the most efficient way
[27:22] to bring freedom uh and Bitcoin being
[27:25] this uh base layer for most of uh
[27:29] actions uh uh within Society at least uh
[27:33] is the most liberating technological
[27:35] tool out there interesting do you do you
[27:39] consider uh the internet being a bigger
[27:43] Revolution for for for bit than Bitcoin
[27:46] it's interesting because last time a
[27:49] guest actually said that he he's like
[27:52] the Internet is just there to enable
[27:54] Bitcoin and I'm like oh like that that's
[27:56] an interesting the the he the last guest
[28:00] said uh that the Internet is just there
[28:04] to enable Bitcoin uh which I'm like
[28:08] maybe an overstatement Because the
[28:09] Internet is bringing a lot more maybe we
[28:12] could build everything on bitcoin but
[28:14] that's maybe not a good idea uh do do
[28:17] you see Bitcoin as the currently the
[28:19] biggest Revolution going on or is like
[28:21] the internet in grind with that or is
[28:23] internet
[28:25] bigger well internet is I guess without
[28:27] internet we wouldn't have Bitcoin so uh
[28:30] it's hard to compare them uh and
[28:33] internet Bitcoin can also reshape the
[28:35] internet and maybe maybe we see it
[28:37] happening uh in
[28:39] nost uh but yes internet was giving I
[28:43] was not there but I know that for
[28:45] libertarian movement in 80s 90s internet
[28:48] was just you know the biggest hope you
[28:50] know it finally brings a freedom of
[28:51] speech it brings uh uncontrolled
[28:54] communication and uh exchange of ideas
[28:57] and now finally when people could find
[29:00] this uh works of hyek and mener even if
[29:03] they are not being pushed in schools or
[29:05] in their libraries finally the world
[29:07] will learn what is true economy and what
[29:09] is proper philosophy and we will you
[29:12] know the world will be free um it I
[29:16] don't think that experiment has failed
[29:19] because on you know this kind of
[29:21] cultural changes uh they have lots of
[29:23] inertia and the internet still only
[29:26] maybe since in the western world since 5
[29:28] 10 years we can say that internet is
[29:30] wildly
[29:32] adopted and I guess its form is not yet
[29:36] ultimate that that there is definitely
[29:38] some kind of capture of uh by platforms
[29:42] uh platforms who also uh cooperate with
[29:46] governments and they got prefer
[29:48] preferential uh conditions uh for
[29:51] business they they cooperate with
[29:54] intelligence Services the government
[29:56] also uh mostly holds the infrastructure
[29:59] which is also changing right and we need
[30:01] this change for internet actually to to
[30:03] be libertarian tools so so there is not
[30:06] that much capture of the infrastructure
[30:09] and on the narrative level of the
[30:11] internet I think today uh we
[30:13] unfortunately found ourself ourselves
[30:16] there so uh those Libertarians from 80s
[30:19] or 90s they might say that this
[30:21] experiment has failed uh I think this is
[30:24] still ongoing and I think it's also an
[30:26] example uh that you know the the winning
[30:30] path of Bitcoin is also not certain that
[30:33] it also uh there is possibility that it
[30:36] could be captured by maybe not even
[30:39] government but if it's captured by some
[30:40] institution or by if it's not
[30:43] decentralized um uh in the future then
[30:47] it it it something might happen with
[30:49] Bitcoin that happened with internet
[30:51] today and we might complain that oh you
[30:53] know it's actually there is a problem
[30:56] with uh with mining with Val ation with
[30:59] with dark coins so uh we need to keep
[31:04] that in mind and you know it's hard to
[31:06] compare internet to bitcoin but I guess
[31:08] the uh adoption path of uh internet and
[31:12] adoption this capture uh that that
[31:15] happened U and is still happening and
[31:18] there is there is there is a battle of
[31:21] uh open source and centralized
[31:23] internet it can give a some kind of
[31:27] insight into to uh What uh what Bitcoin
[31:30] could bring so I don't think you know
[31:32] the battle is won already uh or or that
[31:36] it will be won in the future there is
[31:39] still lots of questions for both
[31:42] internet and uh and Bitcoin uh but the
[31:46] more uh the more such tools uh will be
[31:51] out there because it's you know Starling
[31:53] also you might say that uh is also a
[31:56] technology that brings more freedom
[31:58] uh mobile phones and the fact that you
[32:01] can run your monetary node in your
[32:03] pocket uh is also something that uh came
[32:07] not from the government but brings more
[32:09] freedom so the more such tools will be
[32:12] added I don't know open source large
[32:14] language models the more chance will be
[32:17] that uh internet will actually if looked
[32:21] back from the civilizational perspective
[32:23] I don't know 200 years in the future
[32:25] when we look back on this time this
[32:27] period that actually uh internet has won
[32:30] our fight for Freedom yeah I believe you
[32:32] know that there is there is also under
[32:36] internet there is yes infrastructural
[32:39] layer but under all of this there is a
[32:42] base layer of culture and philosophy
[32:46] that is held by society which whatever
[32:50] tools you bring to them it might not be
[32:53] able to sustain them and use them for
[32:55] for The Right Use maybe it's maybe it's
[32:58] a bit too early that we as Humanity uh I
[33:02] had nothing to do with it I didn't add
[33:04] nothing but let's say that we as
[33:06] Humanity um invented uh Atomic uh Power
[33:11] uh or DNA editing or or Bitcoin or AI
[33:16] maybe uh we just you know it it was just
[33:20] 200 years and it's still ongoing process
[33:23] uh since we liberated uh we liberated
[33:26] since people of color or
[33:29] of homosexual orientation got equal
[33:32] political rights and it's still not
[33:34] Global right so now we have yes this
[33:36] tools like Bitcoin internet open source
[33:39] AI but the ideas that
[33:44] are prevalent in society the memes the
[33:48] culture the
[33:50] philosophy I don't think that it is
[33:53] necessarily Freedom
[33:55] oriented so we can only hope that yes
[33:57] this tool and we can see that Bitcoin is
[33:59] a good example actually that that it's a
[34:01] tool that actually can influence those
[34:04] philosophical layer and this is uh
[34:07] always uplifting for me to see that
[34:09] there is so much interested in
[34:12] philosophy culture in the work of uh of
[34:15] state of of the theory of information
[34:19] among bitcoiners because it it shows
[34:22] that when the freedom tool happens it
[34:26] might influence those BAS layer that
[34:28] moves so slowly that Phil change the
[34:33] philosophy uh of the mut the common
[34:36] philosophy the culture of society is it
[34:39] has so much more inertia it's so much
[34:40] more difficult task that you know
[34:43] publishing books or organizing seminars
[34:46] as I said before might bring effect but
[34:48] might not while having those tools like
[34:52] open source Bitcoin
[34:55] internet we might eventually make maybe
[34:57] change mindset uh of humanity and yes
[35:02] the direction of of of society will be
[35:05] uh in a direction of freedom but it's uh
[35:08] it's not given so uh I don't even know
[35:11] if I'm optimistic about it uh to be
[35:15] honest but I mean for the right I'm sure
[35:18] that it will take Generations you know
[35:20] so so we will not see the end result
[35:22] anyway I'm here for the right and I know
[35:25] that this is the direction I want to go
[35:27] with with my career and my passion I
[35:31] partnered up with coin vigilante this is
[35:34] the most beautiful Bitcoin time piece
[35:37] that I ever saw created by anyone look
[35:40] at that beauty I love it so much coin
[35:42] vigilante made and perfect Bitcoin watch
[35:46] that's the perfect subtle elegent way to
[35:49] go out there and show that you are a
[35:51] bitcoiner and that watch brand is
[35:54] Bitcoin only and coin vigilante just dro
[35:57] dropped a completely new and amazing
[36:00] Genesis edition of their watch
[36:02] collections you have the date of the
[36:05] first ever minded Bitcoin Block in there
[36:08] and of course also the block height and
[36:11] which Epoch we are currently in I love
[36:14] the level of detail they put in in this
[36:17] masterpiece and make sure to check out
[36:19] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[36:22] down in the descriptions I love those
[36:25] watches so so much if you watch or
[36:28] listen to my podcast on a regular basis
[36:30] I'll guess you already bought some
[36:32] Bitcoin and now the most important step
[36:35] is to keep the Bitcoin keep them secure
[36:38] in a hardware wallet my personal
[36:40] recommendation for Hardware wallet is
[36:42] the bitbox it's super secure it's simple
[36:45] to set up it's also perfect gift for a
[36:47] friend who has still their Bitcoin on an
[36:50] exchange and you can get a 5% discount
[36:54] with the code Robin at the checkout
[36:56] visit bitbox
[36:58] Swiss robobin to get your bitbox and the
[37:01] next step is to really level up your
[37:03] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[37:06] have the most secure self- custody setup
[37:09] you have to secure your own devices you
[37:12] have to protect your privacy you have to
[37:15] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[37:18] on where you live you even want to have
[37:20] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[37:22] move in case something goes really
[37:24] really wrong and through all those steps
[37:26] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[37:29] step by step and if you visit the
[37:32] Bitcoin way.com
[37:34] Partners robobin you even get a 30
[37:37] minute free call to find out how you can
[37:40] level up your sovereignty interesting
[37:43] yeah I mean
[37:44] now the internet is also just here for
[37:47] like two decades basically I mean it has
[37:50] been uh maybe three tetes depending on
[37:52] on where you put the starting date of it
[37:56] on uh but
[37:58] it's it's kind of fascinating how far we
[38:00] already came from uh we we first needed
[38:04] electricity to have something like
[38:06] internet then we need internet to have
[38:08] something like AI have something like uh
[38:11] Bitcoin and have something like yeah
[38:13] like uber social media all the other
[38:16] things freedom of speech that came with
[38:18] that and it's it's going faster and
[38:21] faster and and I think we just on the on
[38:24] the on the first inning of of seeing
[38:28] what what this can can bring to humanity
[38:30] uh and yeah
[38:33] we I I think we're not at the we're not
[38:36] even close to the middle point of any
[38:39] adoption when it comes to internet or
[38:41] Bitcoin or AI or anything like we we
[38:43] just at the starting point yeah can we
[38:46] speak even about the internet if there
[38:47] is no native value transfer right so I
[38:50] don't think even like that that there is
[38:52] it's still better of the internet yeah
[38:55] you can publish website and you can
[38:57] communicate we people send text to each
[38:58] other but if you cannot send value is it
[39:01] internet hopefully in the you know 50
[39:04] 100 years we could say if you can't send
[39:07] things digitally is it really internet
[39:10] so uh yes the adoption uh is not 100%
[39:14] yet because the potential of what this
[39:16] Technologies of of communication and of
[39:20] I don't know transport energy money can
[39:23] bring to us uh I love science fiction
[39:27] so you know thinking about this this
[39:31] this things even what could happen uh is
[39:34] just fascinating to me uh and I'm glad
[39:37] actually that I'm born and that we live
[39:41] in such times that we can witness those
[39:43] changes maybe maybe maybe we are not
[39:46] ready for them maybe our kids are not
[39:48] ready for the world of social media
[39:50] maybe you know this philosophy of common
[39:54] culture of Western world is not ready
[39:57] for uh decentralized uh money but I'm in
[40:02] for the right and it's fun to observe it
[40:04] and experiment and and see that you know
[40:07] that I couldn't play around with AI five
[40:10] years ago to such extent as I can do
[40:14] today so I'm glad of of technological
[40:17] changes of development uh I only can
[40:20] hope that it brings Freedom um I don't
[40:24] know what uh what are your biggest hopes
[40:27] uh about this do you do you hope to meet
[40:30] AI like General artificial intelligence
[40:34] and talk with a computer or do you hope
[40:36] for space
[40:39] travel I I do hope that I don't have to
[40:44] do my dishes uh and then there's a robot
[40:47] going around the house and and doing all
[40:50] the the weird work that we have to do
[40:52] like laundry like uh vacuum cleaning
[40:55] like vacuum cleaning I already have a
[40:57] Rob but like uh all the things that we
[41:00] we do uh that I think are not really
[41:03] necessary for a human being to to do
[41:05] that work like cleaning and stuff like
[41:08] that a robot should do that I think we
[41:11] should really move fast towards that
[41:13] future where humans can spend their
[41:17] scarce time and brain power towards
[41:20] bigger
[41:21] questions uh uh than doing dishes uh
[41:25] nothing against doing dishes but
[41:28] I think about when I do dishes you know
[41:30] like otherwise I wouldn't be able to
[41:32] like digest some of my thoughts so some
[41:34] of this stuff which kind of look
[41:37] brainless give space for this creativity
[41:41] maybe but I think it's better to just go
[41:43] for a walk in the in the nature like if
[41:45] if you want to uh like think about
[41:47] things uh I I get what you're saying
[41:49] because I also do it right now like I
[41:51] when I do laundry and the dishes uh I
[41:55] usually don't have a podcast running
[41:57] sometimes I do have a podcast running
[41:58] but I usually don't because it's like uh
[42:01] the time where I can just set off my uh
[42:05] um my my brain but I I like doing more
[42:09] like just walking through a forest uh
[42:12] where there's nothing just me in the
[42:14] forest it's it's even better for me to
[42:17] like offset and like derail myself a
[42:20] little bit from the normal world uh but
[42:24] but I that's kind of what I'm hoping for
[42:26] in the future where Humanity can ask the
[42:30] the bigger question and can really go
[42:32] towards really big goals of like or how
[42:35] do we civilize other planets or uh how
[42:38] uh like there are like big questions and
[42:41] then there's creativity we need people
[42:43] that are creative with art and culture I
[42:46] think that's that's a part that is
[42:48] really really big um for example CH
[42:51] Rogan when he launched his podcast he
[42:53] needed five years to get it to a state
[42:56] where it's able now if you launch a
[42:59] podcast it's way quicker possible
[43:01] because the culture space uh ran uh is
[43:06] uh is already way more evolved and is is
[43:09] way bigger already and I I think maybe
[43:13] it's more difficult because it's there
[43:14] is more Little Joe rogans out there it's
[43:17] I think it's way easier like when Joe
[43:19] Rogan started uh I don't know like he
[43:22] started 16 years ago like there there
[43:24] was no Discovery from YouTube there was
[43:27] no handbooks on how to do podcast and
[43:29] how to distribute things he was the only
[43:31] one doing and he he got a really big
[43:33] crowd and he was also a comedian so it
[43:36] was not even that hard for him to do
[43:37] because he was already a comedian he was
[43:40] in UFC he did a lot of things to have a
[43:43] successful podcast actually um but he
[43:45] needed five years to uh make the podcast
[43:50] uh um uh um profitable and it's not
[43:55] already
[43:58] I broke even after four months like
[44:00] there's no cost of doing a podcast like
[44:03] there is um I mean obviously maybe it's
[44:06] a
[44:07] wrong yeah but is it like for you
[44:11] counting your time and involvement yes
[44:14] nice exactly like like the break even
[44:17] point is really quickly reached because
[44:20] uh you need maybe maybe let's say if we
[44:25] calculate all the tools that I currently
[44:27] use and really need maybe there's like
[44:30] hundred to 300 EUR per month that you
[44:33] need for software licenses and things to
[44:35] make the process easy but you can do it
[44:38] for zero like you you can break even
[44:42] after right when you start because
[44:44] there's no cost to that you already have
[44:47] a phone that's all you need to start a
[44:50] podcast um but if you ask of like okay
[44:53] what is the break even Point uh of me
[44:56] reaching a higher salary higher salary
[45:00] or higher profit than my previous salary
[45:03] was I reached that point after I think
[45:06] eight or nine months now granted um I
[45:10] put in enormous amount of work and I
[45:13] went all in and I worked like 70 hours a
[45:16] week like I just go went completely
[45:20] Bonkers on on my
[45:22] podcast but it's possible and I was not
[45:26] famous still not famous like I I did I
[45:29] was not a comedian on the S who has an
[45:31] audience I I was not a successful
[45:34] entrepreneur I in fact that's podcast is
[45:37] my first business that I started I
[45:39] didn't had anything that gave me
[45:41] leverage like I didn't had a a book to
[45:44] start with like if you have some
[45:45] audience or some now you can write a
[45:47] book and podcast would be your your
[45:48] leverage so you started exactly yeah
[45:51] like now you can do that but my point
[45:53] was like uh I think we have way more
[45:57] room in the future to do creative uh
[46:00] things and to do ask bigger questions
[46:03] and uh do bigger tasks uh than
[46:07] doing don't I don't want to restrict it
[46:10] to laundry and dishes uh but uh and and
[46:13] if you want to do laundry and dishes you
[46:15] can still have the option to do that
[46:16] yourself uh but for example I'm I I
[46:20] bought the robot vacuum cleaner uh and
[46:23] uh now my floors are uh really good all
[46:28] the time and I don't have to do the
[46:30] cleaning myself I bought back some of my
[46:33] time and at time like human time is the
[46:37] most valuable thing on earth then then
[46:40] there's Bitcoin like human time I think
[46:42] is the most valuable thing that that you
[46:44] can possibly have and and I think that's
[46:47] uh what I'm hoping for that everyone can
[46:50] choose what to do with their time uh and
[46:54] and they can do laundry and dishes if
[46:56] they really want to U but they can opt
[46:59] out of that also and humanity and all
[47:02] the all individual human beings can kind
[47:05] of choose what they really like to do uh
[47:08] and uh we get to a state where uh things
[47:11] a little bit
[47:13] more uh I think we evolve over time
[47:16] anyways if you look back the last sorry
[47:18] for the tension but if you look back
[47:21] like 400 years ago the richest man alive
[47:24] 400 years ago couldn't do
[47:27] what we both two normal blabs can do
[47:31] like he couldn't just uh phone someone
[47:34] on the other side of the world and talk
[47:35] with them he couldn't uh fly with a
[47:38] Blaine just in the middle like almost
[47:41] everyone that is watching here probably
[47:43] has the financial capabilities of buying
[47:45] an airplane ticket today and leaving the
[47:48] country tomorrow in some other uh
[47:51] country the the richest man alive like
[47:53] hundreds of years ago couldn't do that
[47:56] so that's what I'm kind of mean with
[47:58] that like our our standard of living and
[48:02] and where we spend our time will
[48:05] massively evolve uh but we still all
[48:07] have work but the work will change
[48:10] completely and and uh yeah I do hope for
[48:12] those bigger ideas of like civilizing
[48:15] other planets maybe uh and focusing more
[48:18] on things and maybe it's actually I was
[48:22] recently uh um on on a invited on a talk
[48:26] in in Austria and there was a uh I gave
[48:29] a presentation on bitcoin and my uh
[48:32] precursor that that talked before me uh
[48:35] he talked also on the idea that we are
[48:38] kind of moving into an abundant future
[48:40] with Bitcoin
[48:43] where we we get so rich a civilization
[48:46] that we have to figure out what human
[48:48] beings are doing uh and there will be
[48:51] some human beings that just play video
[48:53] games all day long because we don't need
[48:55] so many workers anymore and uh we we
[48:58] don't need so many uh people to work
[49:01] anymore because we have an really
[49:02] abundant future where most of the things
[49:05] are digital most of the things are
[49:06] really cheap uh and even to buy like one
[49:09] robot that helps you with all the house
[49:12] uh cost you just like one day of work uh
[49:16] I I'm I'm really hopeful for um what the
[49:19] future brings and and where we are going
[49:21] with with Bitcoin EI uh technology um
[49:25] Uber I don't I don't think I don't think
[49:28] we can see what your precursor described
[49:31] in in our lifetimes uh if we could uh it
[49:35] will be for a small subset of of the you
[49:37] know human population uh already there
[49:40] is small subset that plays only video
[49:42] games and they don't have to work right
[49:45] but for such changes to happen for whole
[49:49] planet yes we need Bitcoin because
[49:51] otherwise uh Fiat monetary system will
[49:54] only bring more inequality and it will
[49:57] just suck
[49:58] uh resources from those at the bottom of
[50:02] let's say cantillon
[50:04] pyramid so yes uh in this regard I guess
[50:07] uh we need Bitcoin for for such Vision
[50:09] to happen but some people could argue
[50:12] that you know this technological
[50:13] progress uh can be possible without and
[50:16] it is right those planes and the
[50:19] internet they and the computer games and
[50:22] vacuum cleaners also were um were done
[50:25] and this progress was created because uh
[50:28] without Bitcoin but maybe uh you could
[50:31] point that because of the extortion of
[50:34] uh uh Fiat system that uh many people
[50:39] cannot afford
[50:41] it as a result of of the Fiat system and
[50:45] only few people can create such
[50:47] companies and then use products of of
[50:51] theirs I I guess the argument there is
[50:54] like um if we move into more more
[50:56] digital world and more technology world
[50:59] there's only one thing that you cannot
[51:01] copy and it's Bitcoin like that that
[51:04] that seems to be for me uh the the the
[51:07] the major thing of like if if we move
[51:10] towards more digital uh more technology
[51:14] uh and even more Ai and all those things
[51:17] there's only one thing that uh nobody
[51:19] can ever make more of and and that's
[51:23] kind of kind of kind of Bitcoin and it's
[51:25] but yeah we we
[51:27] I I I wanted to to get also into Albi
[51:29] but we we kind of went into all
[51:31] different topics Joe ran
[51:36] experience let's pretend we are experts
[51:39] on technology and human development as
[51:42] we've been for the last 40 minutes now
[51:44] we can continue now we can talk about I
[51:46] can talk about Alid at least this is
[51:48] something I I know more about and
[51:50] without pretending
[51:53] um yeah guys whoever of your listeners
[51:56] uh is into lightning Network and I guess
[51:59] most of guys are interested in it they
[52:02] probably know what is Albi uh Albi it's
[52:05] it's hard to describe because it started
[52:07] as a project maintaining the uh
[52:11] lightning browser extension and that's
[52:12] actually where the name comes from
[52:14] lbe this an extension enabled users uh
[52:18] to use their lightning nodes on on the
[52:21] browser Chrome Firefox Safari so they
[52:24] could connect it connect you have their
[52:26] wallet from their node but in the
[52:27] browser so then uh you know you could
[52:30] tip online you could just you know send
[52:33] receive see your transactions and basic
[52:36] features of of wallets but uh over the
[52:39] last three years we we grew we evolved
[52:41] uh at least on the horizontal plane uh
[52:46] and we maintain lots of projects all of
[52:48] them open source we have a uh lightning
[52:51] node we we released and maintain called
[52:54] alub which is also free an OP source and
[52:57] it's our recent uh product from the last
[53:01] year uh that makes uh we we believe it's
[53:04] a next step in lightning self- custody
[53:06] and node running because it makes it so
[53:09] much easier and it's now so much more
[53:11] versatile to run lightning node on
[53:14] almost any device without that much
[53:16] hustle as it used to be we have a mobile
[53:19] wallet called aligo we maintain lots of
[53:21] libraries for developers so if you are a
[53:24] regular end users end user you may be
[53:26] not notice it but if you are a developer
[53:29] and uh probably some of you guests are
[53:32] your audience and you want to implement
[53:34] uh lightning or Noster somehow in your
[53:37] app we we have and you can check our
[53:40] GitHub uh lots of interesting libraries
[53:42] that makes it much easier to implement
[53:44] SATs into your app
[53:47] economy but yes so there three biggest
[53:50] products of Albi is the browser
[53:52] extension Al Go Mobile wallet and alub
[53:55] the lightning node uh but recently we
[53:57] also we've been providing this custodial
[54:00] lightning wallets now we call it ALB
[54:02] account uh that was because behind each
[54:05] of this uh ALB you know Mobile wallet or
[54:08] browser extension it there has to be
[54:10] some lighning node and for most of the
[54:13] users it was super easy because they
[54:14] were using ALB node custodial setup but
[54:19] uh at the beginning beginning of this
[54:20] year we Sunset it we closed down this
[54:22] node and uh now all of our users are
[54:26] self custodial so it's quite a pivot it
[54:29] makes it maybe a bit more difficult uh
[54:31] for users to use lighting Network
[54:33] because there is at least with us you
[54:34] cannot just register and and and use
[54:37] lightning and use our node but because
[54:40] we don't want your SS um so it takes
[54:43] some effort but uh it makes and we
[54:47] believe that it pro it brings the future
[54:50] of actually decentralized and St
[54:52] custodial lightning Network closer
[54:54] because otherwise if users of today
[54:57] lightning Network which is still super
[54:59] small would be so much used to uh using
[55:02] third party as their lightning wallet uh
[55:05] I don't think that the evolution of uh
[55:09] this network and this protocol would be
[55:13] um in a proper direction so we made a
[55:17] decision to uh switch to a fully self
[55:20] custodial setup which yes annoyed maybe
[55:24] some users uh but uh with overwhelming
[55:27] uh majority uh comes with a very
[55:30] positive feedback and there is rather
[55:32] appreciation from the ecosystem that uh
[55:34] we made this step so whoever uh uh
[55:39] haven't tried it yet guys try running
[55:41] your node with albop is so much easier
[55:43] uh you can be in control of your sets uh
[55:47] that's why we came here right to be your
[55:49] own bank not to use Albi as your bank we
[55:53] we often talk about how important this
[55:56] to take self custody on a main layer
[55:58] what is the importance of self- custody
[56:01] on Lightning many argue us like oh like
[56:03] I only have $50 on there or like $100 in
[56:06] there I don't really care if I get rck
[56:08] pulled uh it's a different discussion if
[56:10] you have like uh maybe like a whole
[56:13] Bitcoin on coinbase then you're like oh
[56:15] like you should maybe take it off and
[56:16] take self custody what is the importance
[56:19] of self- custody on on on Layer Two well
[56:21] of self custody the control is important
[56:24] and the fact that no one could R pull
[56:27] you exit with your money but also
[56:29] privacy um the bigger you are as a
[56:32] custodian the more you need to comply
[56:35] with some regulations which
[56:38] uh which are against the privacy of
[56:41] users which can give away your data who
[56:46] you transact with For What and how much
[56:48] do you use lightning with with with some
[56:51] Regulatory Agencies so the Privacy is
[56:54] big uh Factor but today maybe yes if you
[56:58] use if user use $50 to zap here and
[57:01] there they don't need to you know self
[57:05] custody on lightning is not for everyone
[57:08] because they don't need to run their
[57:09] node and pay for the energy or hassle
[57:13] you know have all this hassle with with
[57:15] it but to scale Bitcoin uh there will
[57:18] not be you know only 5,000 BTC locked in
[57:22] lightning channels as it is today but uh
[57:27] most of the transactions that we will be
[57:29] doing in this hyper bitcoinz world would
[57:32] be we believe in the lighting network
[57:35] but on some uh another layer uh that is
[57:39] designed to scale
[57:40] Bitcoin not on chain so we need to
[57:43] explore that and and we need to uh
[57:47] explore and build in the direction uh
[57:50] that it will be decentralized in the
[57:51] future as I as I stated uh in the
[57:54] earlier right network is not just three
[57:58] uh companies and a blink wallet of
[57:59] Satoshi and Al sending tokens to each
[58:02] other but
[58:04] uh if we want yes free money and if we
[58:09] want that this this scaling layer um
[58:12] would be decentralized uh and this is
[58:15] our vision we need to take care of self-
[58:19] custody now and uh not all of you guys
[58:23] need to have this mission in mind uh but
[58:27] all of all of all of us would appreciate
[58:30] the more everyone at least tries node
[58:33] running tries how it is it's a good
[58:36] feeling to zap on stacker news or on
[58:39] nost to uh learn how channels work how
[58:43] self custody Works uh you know there
[58:46] is it's hard to convince someone like on
[58:50] the street hey you need to try lighting
[58:52] Network because you can zap on nost and
[58:54] on top of that you need to run your own
[58:56] note to have a wallet for this lighting
[58:58] Network yes there is not it seems like
[59:01] there is no practical answer why would
[59:04] somebody and why would I go on nost and
[59:07] I guess uh still we are all ear adopters
[59:10] and most of our users are doing this uh
[59:14] to experiment but also in in Hope of
[59:17] building something greater and uh we
[59:20] need to do it together uh with
[59:22] podcasters uh I believe you also get
[59:25] some s on value for Value model for this
[59:29] with our developers and with users so uh
[59:34] this pivot or uh shift to self custody
[59:39] maybe it's not
[59:41] the the best
[59:45] business wise step that would bring
[59:48] quickback to Albi but uh we are driven
[59:52] by Mission and uh our investors are to
[59:56] that's why we still have resources to
[59:58] build it because uh ALB doesn't charge
[60:02] almost anything for all of this uh tools
[60:04] I
[60:06] mentioned and uh with hopes that uh in
[60:09] the future it would pay off interesting
[60:12] it could that be like when we talk about
[60:15] future scaling of Bitcoin and what we
[60:18] see with Nostra we see with early apps
[60:21] uh that connect to that with podcasting
[60:23] 2.0 with with fountain with all those
[60:26] great things that is going on is is that
[60:29] maybe the the new kind of form of
[60:31] internet where we have a native token
[60:34] with Bitcoin in it I don't know if it is
[60:37] uh for me it feels like yes um I guess I
[60:42] I guess you can also share this uh uh
[60:45] feeling with me that you know when you
[60:46] explore this you can go on galb comis
[60:50] Discover we maintain there is like 130
[60:53] different places where you could use
[60:56] unque places where you can use lightning
[60:58] and nost and there are like discussion
[61:00] boards fax interfaces exchanges some IRC
[61:05] chats where you need to zap to post a
[61:08] message and
[61:09] various experimental um unique projects
[61:13] that using them gives me this vipe of uh
[61:17] old internet or maybe new
[61:19] internet you know when you scroll the
[61:23] Legacy uh social media and Twitter or
[61:26] Facebook you do it and then you oh yeah
[61:29] this is it you do it and you kind of
[61:31] feel bad why do you why do you why why
[61:34] do you even spend so much money there is
[61:37] so much time on this there is there is
[61:38] not that much good content it's not even
[61:40] fun anymore to explore the internet just
[61:42] scrolling uh X or Facebook but doing
[61:45] this on Noster and exploring these
[61:48] different Noster clients that were or
[61:50] apps where things maybe not necessarily
[61:52] work the in the most smooth manner or
[61:55] they are not the most beautiful or there
[61:56] is not that much usage but you get into
[61:59] this little corners of this new internet
[62:01] where you meet interesting people where
[62:03] you see people who build stuff that
[62:05] maybe no one uses but there is this vibe
[62:08] there is this energy and you have this
[62:10] feeling like from the uh early days of
[62:13] exploration at least like early 2000 was
[62:15] my early were my early days of Internet
[62:17] exploration and back then yes you you
[62:19] got into some corners of the internet
[62:22] some blogs where some Niche projects
[62:24] were uh being collaborated on today I
[62:28] don't remember where on Legacy internet
[62:30] uh even on Reddit you could find such uh
[62:34] such places that give you this Vibe and
[62:36] feeling while being on nost and
[62:38] lightning it does so it is also in fun
[62:41] right uh for me and for
[62:45] us it's amazing how much is there there
[62:49] is on like that's that's just for for
[62:52] the people that just listen that that
[62:54] that's there like get al.com how is it
[62:57] get al.com disover and you can basically
[63:00] see so many apps and those are all apps
[63:04] that connect with Albi or how is that
[63:07] working yeah the the key to create is
[63:09] that the are the websites or platforms
[63:12] or apps that you could use Al with so
[63:14] there is not like everything from the
[63:16] Bitcoin ecosystem every project but
[63:18] something that you could use ALB
[63:20] extension with or you could pay to get
[63:22] ALB address or use your Noster keys with
[63:25] it so I guess it's a largest such list
[63:28] of active projects still maintained
[63:30] because there used to be some of them uh
[63:32] but I think it's the largest such
[63:34] created list there is already you see
[63:36] eight AI tools one of them is to build
[63:39] chains of language models another is to
[63:42] pay with SATs for various there is like
[63:45] 30 different models that you pay with
[63:47] SATs per usage so you don't have to
[63:48] subscribe to open AI but you can use
[63:50] paper question and you can payer
[63:52] question or you can do web search like
[63:54] perplexity do but with AI paid with
[63:57] Bitcoin so you don't have to sign up for
[63:59] this big corpse that sell your data but
[64:02] there is some uh Team of young
[64:04] developers that uh you can see that
[64:06] there are bitcoiners they are often on n
[64:09] and discuss openly how they want to
[64:11] build this tool what's driving them and
[64:13] you can support them by using by testing
[64:15] by giving feedback and doing this is fun
[64:18] and most of these tools I actually use I
[64:20] actually see usage it's not like I do it
[64:22] only for experimenting but actually use
[64:24] Bitcoin prediction Market Market because
[64:26] I love predicting and and making money
[64:28] on this I use a paper question because
[64:31] this is my main go-to place to use AI uh
[64:34] or stuer used to have discussions so uh
[64:38] yeah this this for example right
[64:39] lightning Cuts you can pay with SATs and
[64:42] you you can do a donation I guess if you
[64:44] click on use the force you will do a
[64:45] donation and then some uh food will come
[64:49] for cuts and there is a live stream in
[64:51] Switzerland there are two cuts uh Yi and
[64:54] uh kite or something yeah kala Yuri and
[64:58] kala and they might they might come to
[65:00] eat food that you paid for them with the
[65:02] lightning SS right why would you do it
[65:05] right why would you do it I guess for
[65:08] fun to meet this interesting people in
[65:09] Switzerland to see what what's possible
[65:13] with u um with these Technologies I
[65:17] don't know what could be possible with
[65:19] it I can see so many more different uh
[65:22] use cases if this gets adopted If people
[65:24] could feed maybe animals in some Forest
[65:28] I don't know if it's if if it's good to
[65:31] feed animals in forest with SS but this
[65:33] Cuts in uh in t will for sure enjoy some
[65:37] some Karma but uh uh I I I would like to
[65:41] is can I can I put there something it's
[65:43] like what what is the want to add a
[65:46] note yeah try it if you had know there
[65:50] will be a comment section you pay the
[65:52] invoice and I guess this little Yoda
[65:56] there is this baby Yoda figure uh I
[65:59] guess there that's that's where the food
[66:01] will come out from wait I will I will
[66:04] try that now on I remember
[66:08] also I'm not sure if it's on this
[66:10] discover but there is also similar
[66:12] project with chickens if you Google
[66:14] lightning Polo or if poo you know
[66:17] Spanish or if your listeners Google
[66:19] lightning chickens or lightning goats
[66:23] there is also live stream of goats where
[66:24] you can feed goats with the SATs okay I
[66:27] I have done
[66:29] it oh now it's here you see your comment
[66:33] and is there food oh Yoda moved did you
[66:35] see baby Yoda has moved baby Yoda moved
[66:38] oh man that's so great I'm not sure if
[66:41] there is food came out oh I think it's
[66:44] like in in 37 minutes there's now food
[66:47] again something like that yeah otherwise
[66:48] like this cut would be you know they
[66:50] would die of over eating so that's good
[66:52] that somebody applied the rate limit for
[66:55] yeah oh man but that's that's fun yeah
[66:59] and and that's kind of the the whole
[67:01] idea of of of Bitcoin right like you you
[67:03] you want to have those uh interactive
[67:07] act apps and then when you have actual
[67:09] value as a native token with like a open
[67:12] permissionless per permissionless system
[67:16] that's just uh amazing and that's a fun
[67:19] thing obviously that's a gimmick uh but
[67:22] we can have so many great things with
[67:25] that that's that's that's a that's
[67:27] really cool I I like that Bitcoin map
[67:29] obviously yeah really cool I like those
[67:31] things um I have to I have to look
[67:35] through them because some of them
[67:37] actually know yeah some of them you know
[67:39] you said yeah for example we had from
[67:43] how does it how is it how is that
[67:45] pronounce c castra um I had I had him on
[67:50] and he is also doing that pull up Jamie
[67:52] uh pull it up Jamie uh that's really F
[67:56] there's actually when you go to pull
[67:58] that up Jamie uh and you go like self
[68:01] custody you you can actually see I think
[68:04] my podcast even a podcast search here uh
[68:09] and
[68:10] Bitcoin and I think ah it IND the
[68:14] transcripts of your podcast and it do
[68:17] does yeah exactly so for example this is
[68:19] one of my recent podcasts uh with with
[68:22] Bitcoin dad uh and
[68:26] there he uses the transcripts of the
[68:27] recent podcast that's really cool also
[68:29] here I had former Red Bull CEO on uh and
[68:33] that that was just a yeah really cool
[68:36] one and then you can uh search things
[68:39] here
[68:40] somehow uh and you did for free right
[68:43] you didn't you didn't even pay you
[68:45] didn't I didn't pay anything
[68:48] now uh uh yeah but you you can see here
[68:52] the available sources so like
[68:56] uh di Diary of a CEO is here Walker is
[69:00] here I'm here uh Robert POF yeah great
[69:04] cerine podcast s Bitcoin obviously yeah
[69:07] really cool Jo Rogan also yeah here you
[69:11] can see the chog experience so like that
[69:13] that's really that's a really cool
[69:15] feature also um and yeah corny chat hi
[69:20] talk Bitcoin uh yeah it's it's it's
[69:24] really cool um to to see those
[69:26] developments exploring somebody doesn't
[69:28] know this and G Al comeis discover uh
[69:32] you would spend at least three days
[69:34] exploring uh these different use cases
[69:36] so you know Bitcoin is not just send
[69:38] receive but it's also fit Cuts
[69:41] absolutely yeah and I I have to check
[69:44] back later if if the cat got uh got
[69:46] actually
[69:48] fed it says like in 40 minutes there's
[69:50] the next feeding
[69:52] again really cool um
[69:55] uh we we got off track again but I I
[69:58] like it um one computer game the off
[70:02] tracks side quests are often more
[70:05] interesting than the clue it it's
[70:08] definitely like that I I enjoy it the
[70:11] most I don't know how how the audience
[70:12] feels about that uh but I do enjoy it
[70:15] the most when when it just gets uh
[70:18] sideways um one thing I'm still want to
[70:21] get into is uh podcasting 2.0 value for
[70:24] value
[70:26] uh and and and how this is all connect
[70:28] with with with Bitcoin that's really
[70:30] interesting kind of the future of the
[70:32] the greater economy uh and I think Al is
[70:36] also really interested and and like
[70:38] really integrated in that already how do
[70:41] you see that and what are the the
[70:43] developments that you see in
[70:47] that it's nice to see that there is
[70:50] adoption among podcasters who are not
[70:52] bitcoiners uh that they learn that you
[70:55] know with a traditional podcast they use
[70:58] this RSS it's an old protocol with an
[71:00] XML files which where they say where is
[71:03] the cover where is the description where
[71:05] is the M3 file to listen this podcast
[71:08] from and since uh three I guess years
[71:12] you could implement the value tag in
[71:13] this XML uh which states to which node
[71:17] could the could SATs be sent to the auor
[71:20] of the podcast and on top of that some
[71:22] people use it right you do Funtime you
[71:24] do Boost but there can be uh more
[71:27] complicated setups like you you need to
[71:29] uh pay to access some section of the
[71:32] file or you can earn SS actually if you
[71:34] listen to ad so there is some
[71:37] opportunities still unexplored and I
[71:39] guess it will also take some time
[71:40] because it takes adoption from podcast
[71:42] hosting providers from uh authors or
[71:45] listeners Etc uh and then there is a
[71:48] huge industry of video um on this getal
[71:52] com discover you can find there is one
[71:53] platform that I know so far that does it
[71:56] it's called in thehub in the hub. studio
[71:59] that does video casting I would call it
[72:01] video casting 2.0 where you stream SS
[72:04] per minute of watched video and This Ss
[72:07] later when I don't know you watch a
[72:09] movie you rent a like imagine Netflix
[72:11] but without a subscription you pay per
[72:13] usage of the video and per each minute
[72:15] you watch the film the SS are being
[72:18] splitted automatically and stream to
[72:20] director to cast to crew to a screen
[72:23] play out or Etc of course there is not
[72:26] you know it's there is not that much
[72:28] choice of uh films like you find on
[72:31] Netflix there is not from the indiab
[72:34] perspective there is not that much use
[72:36] as uh if they would be building uh
[72:39] probably on Fiat money but if the would
[72:42] if the direction still goes into this
[72:45] uh through this road of towards
[72:48] hyperbitcoinization
[72:50] um they would uh such Technologies would
[72:53] find its uh product Market fit I guess I
[72:58] guess whole lightning didn't maybe not
[73:00] whole but most of lightning still didn't
[73:01] find product Market fits and it's all
[73:04] kind of experimenting they they there
[73:08] most projects they don't yet make money
[73:10] or they didn't break even but yes we are
[73:13] experimenting in hopes for this future
[73:15] and in podcasting 2.0 video casting 2.0
[73:18] in general paying for
[73:21] Content directly to the outter uh is a
[73:24] good step towards this the
[73:26] platformization of the internet that we
[73:29] already uh complained today about and
[73:32] many people do complain because it
[73:34] avoids intermediaries and you
[73:36] can you can pay directly to authors of
[73:39] of blog or video or podcast uh in a
[73:43] really decentralized manner peer-to-peer
[73:45] without him uh maybe with some small
[73:48] percentage going to a podcast hosting or
[73:51] or this uh VOD platform right but in
[73:55] general it goes straight to the uh
[73:59] straight to the outdoor so it brings
[74:01] again it brings This Promise uh that
[74:04] internet was bringing to us but didn't
[74:07] deliver because was
[74:09] captured for various reasons by these
[74:12] big
[74:13] platforms so it's Renaissance I I guess
[74:18] I hope maybe maybe not I guess because
[74:20] it's it's not happening yet on a such
[74:22] scale that we can call it Renaissance
[74:24] but on podcasting yes there is many many
[74:28] such apps like fine
[74:30] like like Pome like
[74:32] poderse and I can see that uh content
[74:36] creators are much more receptive
[74:40] to our vision and this uh Revolution
[74:44] that we believe uh digital monetization
[74:47] and micro payments with Bitcoin bring
[74:49] and this value for Value model uh mainly
[74:51] because uh their Industries are one of
[74:54] the most captured if you are a um music
[74:58] Creator and you are on Spotify or if
[74:59] you're a filmmaker and you're on Netflix
[75:01] you really don't see uh that much dollar
[75:06] that uh the user paid to watch your film
[75:09] um and to uh surface you need to put so
[75:13] much more work while uh when you show
[75:16] some uh outter hey look with a fan or
[75:21] with Indie Hub you can get directly
[75:24] money and there is comments attached to
[75:26] this money from users in real time uh
[75:29] their eyes get big uh I guess because of
[75:32] the specific of the industry they are in
[75:34] but it's uh uplifting to see how
[75:38] receptiv even those who are um or even
[75:41] this is so uplifting specifically if
[75:44] they are not bitcoiners but they are
[75:46] artists and you tell them hey look there
[75:47] is you can go on Tunes then you can
[75:50] stream your uh concert and there is no
[75:53] uh middleman on on the payment way uh
[75:56] there is no big uh Universal Studios or
[76:00] whatever corporate company is there but
[76:03] it's uh it's on protocol and the people
[76:06] who will watch it directly can send it
[76:07] to
[76:09] you they are really receptive to this
[76:12] so I guess that's why Alby
[76:15] also got so much involved uh in the
[76:19] recent years into podcasting and into
[76:21] this value for Value model uh because
[76:23] it's not also only podcast but also text
[76:26] videos graphic
[76:29] Etc because the because of such audience
[76:33] uh we can see in practice is uh very
[76:35] receptive and they are nice Frontier to
[76:39] get somebody to
[76:41] bitcoin and yeah I'm still driven also
[76:43] by this Vision uh I know that for some
[76:47] it might sound utopic utopian because uh
[76:52] it's not yet that much manifested
[76:55] that uh the change of the the thesis
[76:59] that I'm going to is that that CH the
[77:03] monetization the method of monetization
[77:05] influences the content meaning that if
[77:09] the way that content creators are if the
[77:13] content creators are monetized through
[77:15] ads that are
[77:18] displayed on the opening of your content
[77:21] doesn't matter what what your content is
[77:23] and you are monetized
[77:26] just for opening that it it incentivizes
[77:29] clickbait and incentivizes the uh low
[77:32] content appealed by Al algorithms to
[77:35] those that will that will that will be
[77:37] the most receptive to the masses
[77:40] so mon monetization methods influence
[77:43] today monetization methods influence the
[77:45] low quality content while if you have
[77:47] value for Value model and if you have
[77:49] direct interaction between uh the
[77:51] consumer of the content the audience and
[77:54] the Creator podcaster videographer if
[77:57] there with this monetization method you
[77:59] can attach some communication like those
[78:02] boosts if those uh this uh monetization
[78:06] can be done in real time uh in micro
[78:09] payment there is no like threshold from
[78:11] $10 a month there is no your data it can
[78:14] be done out anonymously then the creator
[78:17] of this content is incentivised to
[78:19] appeal to those people who actually read
[78:22] it who actually consume it uh and
[78:25] will create content better Toler to
[78:28] Their audience so I think that this
[78:30] value for Value model incentivizes
[78:32] creation of better
[78:34] content better quality of content but it
[78:38] is yet to see on the large scale so this
[78:41] is something that we dream of but I
[78:43] think it's already happening
[78:46] uh looking at stacker news or nost it's
[78:50] happening but maybe it's happening
[78:51] because we are in a
[78:53] bubble but still I see that the content
[78:56] there is better than on the Legacy
[78:59] internet and I think it's also in a
[79:02] large part uh thanks to it being on a
[79:05] value for Value model not on a model of
[79:08] uh Hey sign up for a big platform and
[79:10] get money from ads or hey uh pay me a
[79:14] bigger amount per month so you can get
[79:16] behind the
[79:17] payable so this is this is kind of a
[79:20] vision that I I still need to verbalize
[79:24] uh to myself better and it will happen
[79:26] when we observe more example of
[79:28] it but
[79:30] uh that's also something that we believe
[79:33] at Albi that the micro payments through
[79:38] um through money digital to through
[79:41] money native to the internet uh
[79:43] incentivize creation of better content
[79:45] so hopefully uh you know in hper bized
[79:48] world we will see better movies better
[79:50] podcasts and better Vlogs yeah that's
[79:53] interesting I mean
[79:56] I don't know if you get rid of
[79:58] ads like I like I think value for value
[80:02] is amazing I think like that's that's
[80:03] like the uh everyone should enable that
[80:07] and and everyone should um uh flourish
[80:10] uh flourish in that but I don't know it
[80:14] it's it's such an amazing model of like
[80:19] having ads in the in the video and
[80:23] playing that from the platform because
[80:26] it's getting the responsibility off from
[80:30] the Creator uh and the you can pay the
[80:35] Creator plus you can still do value for
[80:37] Value I I don't know like uh ads seems
[80:40] to
[80:41] be probably something that sticks around
[80:44] and will also be implemented in Nostra I
[80:46] I feel like there will probably be
[80:49] products coming out of like you can
[80:51] either pay U uh some some amount want to
[80:55] watch it without ads and I don't know
[80:59] like surprised that some clients didn't
[81:00] Implement ads to monetize themselves
[81:03] because many of these clients are you
[81:05] know almost none of them are making
[81:07] money uh many of them are just done with
[81:09] grants or with open source contributions
[81:12] and and it's hard to hope that they will
[81:15] be developed
[81:17] further so I I still I'm a bit surprised
[81:20] that I didn't see this model yet
[81:21] happening to clients but yes I agree
[81:23] with you I didn't mean that this value
[81:26] for Value will
[81:28] replace oh am I am I disconnected okay
[81:32] but it might be reconnected later this
[81:35] rever side so let me finish the sentence
[81:38] I don't think that uh this this value
[81:41] for Value will totally replace the ad
[81:43] model but the more monetization uh more
[81:47] ways to monetize more method of
[81:48] monetization will give more
[81:50] opportunities U for Content creators and
[81:53] it will uh
[81:55] hopefully Drive the quality upwards I'm
[81:59] not sure if you heard me because we had
[82:01] some connection issues um yeah I heard
[82:04] the I heard the last part I think I I
[82:07] got a little bit but I missed some some
[82:09] small parts but it's it's I'm really uh
[82:14] I'm really looking forward to value for
[82:16] Value being implemented more and more
[82:17] and the biggest thing right now for me
[82:19] that I see is a fountain where I'm like
[82:21] okay people actually they can they can
[82:25] consume the podcast for free they don't
[82:27] have to pay anything for that uh and if
[82:30] they consume it on uh Fountain there's
[82:32] also no ads placed in between them like
[82:35] YouTube Place ads in between them uh so
[82:39] that's already extremely cool to have
[82:42] Fountain where they could do it consume
[82:45] it for free but they still stream
[82:47] something they still boost something
[82:49] they still give something extra just to
[82:52] show an appreciation off the content
[82:55] which is that that feels unreal like it
[82:58] feels better to get uh uh $10 in
[83:03] satoshis on on Fountain and then to get
[83:07] $100 uh on YouTube uh for an ad Revenue
[83:10] stuff so that it feels so much better
[83:13] because it comes directly from a person
[83:16] uh and YouTube is just like paying you
[83:19] to have the game theory of like you have
[83:22] to create on YouTube to make uh more
[83:24] money um so that feels really good I
[83:28] just think ads is such an
[83:32] attractive economic model for the
[83:35] graders for the platforms and for the
[83:39] advertisers like it's a a freeway win
[83:43] situation um
[83:45] where I think they will always stick
[83:48] around and it will also be implemented
[83:50] in in in uh in Nostra probably I don't
[83:53] know maybe not it would be great to have
[83:56] a world without advertisements and ads I
[84:00] I just don't see it maybe I'm too con uh
[84:03] maybe I'm too much in the Fiat world
[84:06] still maybe you need to get ad
[84:10] block it will not avoid sponsored
[84:12] content right you may be you you might
[84:14] not call it an ad like I don't know add
[84:18] this little blogs on the on on the
[84:20] website that you're using but if if if
[84:23] you will mention some nice product of
[84:25] Bitcoin is it add or not maybe if
[84:28] somebody send you a hardware wallet and
[84:30] then you slightly you know mention it is
[84:33] it add or not uh yes definitely we will
[84:36] never avoid marketing uh and I think
[84:38] it's good that's how we learn about uh
[84:42] features of product and that's how
[84:44] products actually actually Thrive to be
[84:47] better and cut to their to Their
[84:48] audience
[84:50] yeah yeah I'm also I'm I'm I'm also
[84:53] having
[84:55] it it will be really fun to see uh in
[84:57] the future how this develops because
[85:01] YouTube is already quite good in uh
[85:05] figuring out what people want to watch
[85:08] uh in terms of what what they actually
[85:12] like YouTube has two figures basically
[85:14] that they see the they see the click
[85:16] through it that's what you talking about
[85:18] with clickbait but they also combine
[85:20] that with the average food duration so
[85:23] if you have a thumbnail and a title that
[85:26] a lot of people click on but then
[85:28] they're disappointed and and directly go
[85:30] out of the video uh YouTube will just
[85:32] not push the the video at all like you
[85:34] you have to have both things you have to
[85:36] have the the the high click through rate
[85:39] where people click on the video but you
[85:41] also have to have uh people sticking
[85:44] around in the video which is different
[85:47] from an incentive point of like you you
[85:51] kind of watch what a person is doing on
[85:54] a platform when you have value for Value
[85:57] it's like you watch what uh the person
[86:01] is giving on actual Financial energy
[86:04] like if you're sapping
[86:06] Sates you are basically transferring
[86:09] Financial energy to someone which should
[86:11] be the biggest indicator that he wants
[86:14] to see more of that so I'm also really
[86:16] interesting interested to see how future
[86:20] algorithms will be developed on uh
[86:23] podcast and video and uh short form
[86:27] content Platforms in the future if
[86:29] Nostra and all those platforms are
[86:32] successful uh will be really fun to see
[86:35] how in Nostra you can choose your own
[86:37] algorithm right you can choose your
[86:39] client you can choose your your things
[86:41] it would be really fun to see which ones
[86:43] are the successful ones yeah we will see
[86:46] many of them and uh we will now I'm
[86:49] trying like different clients every day
[86:52] just just to compare them and and have
[86:54] different experience and some people
[86:55] stay on one other people will watch you
[86:58] on zap stream and other will watch you
[87:00] on ss. G but when when you are when
[87:03] YouTube controls your uh pay payout
[87:06] schemes and monetization then yes you
[87:08] need to gamify in cater to their
[87:12] whatever agenda is uh and they're not in
[87:15] an agenda but also algorithm so they
[87:18] they control also by controlling the
[87:21] monetization method they control your
[87:24] content maybe not directly but you
[87:26] sometimes need to think oh I actually
[87:28] should do a 40 minute film not a 35
[87:31] because then they would fit uh two
[87:33] advertisements within the film not one
[87:35] or maybe I shouldn't talk about a
[87:38] specific uh group from Middle East
[87:40] because I will not appear on the uh main
[87:43] page while if if we are talking about uh
[87:46] uh decentralized uh monetization method
[87:50] let's say or or a protocol for uh value
[87:54] for Value then yes one client will use
[87:57] one algorithm for showing your content
[88:00] another will take 5% and will not
[88:02] Implement ads and other will be paid
[88:04] with subscription and will sh share only
[88:06] 50% if you don't talk about this uh
[88:10] group from Middle East Etc right so um
[88:13] then users and content creators will
[88:16] have a choice where to where to meet and
[88:19] uh at what price while today well
[88:22] probably they also still have a choice
[88:24] but most of them are unfortunately on
[88:27] one or two platforms absolutely yeah
[88:29] it's uh it it's really fascinating how
[88:33] big the network effect currently is of a
[88:35] YouTube plat of of a video platform like
[88:38] YouTube and that there is not even um
[88:42] like there's no platform that comes
[88:44] close in terms of users like not even
[88:46] close like Rumble is so small against it
[88:49] uh Twitter is really small against
[88:51] YouTube all the platforms that just try
[88:53] it uh even Facebook don't really has a
[88:56] competitor against uh YouTube they may
[88:59] they are competitors in terms of YouTube
[89:02] shorts like there's Tik Tok there's
[89:04] Instagram reals but I I'm fascinated how
[89:07] big that Network effect of the platform
[89:09] is even though the sense of things even
[89:11] though they have their own flaws um so
[89:14] I'm uh I'm I'm really looking forward to
[89:16] the future of of content graders and the
[89:18] greater economy I will will be really
[89:21] fun to see when we have more
[89:23] interoperability
[89:24] between those platforms hopefully
[89:27] yeah
[89:29] lookity that you post your I don't know
[89:31] on one server you post your video and it
[89:33] can be shown on multiple clients uh
[89:36] unlike uh you need to upload it to
[89:38] YouTube you need to upload it to Twitch
[89:40] they they they don't allow other clients
[89:43] uh or at least limited to have other
[89:45] clients to to watch it uh right so there
[89:48] is no no interrup ability you need to
[89:51] use their wallet you need to use their
[89:54] method of upload uh while nost hopefully
[89:58] changes the way the internet is
[90:00] structured on many levels right how the
[90:03] data is pulled from servers uh how you
[90:06] know what wallet you can connect as
[90:08] Creator or consumer uh interoperability
[90:11] I think is the key here that and Noster
[90:14] makes it beautiful right I remember that
[90:16] there used to be
[90:18] this communication like The Messengers
[90:21] uh in the old internet you could use
[90:22] like this mirinda xmpp and even Facebook
[90:26] was talking this this protocol there was
[90:28] like protocol for communication and many
[90:30] apps could use it right like HTTP is
[90:32] also used by multiple browsers while
[90:34] today when you have account on Facebook
[90:36] you cannot DM somebody from Twitter uh
[90:41] so it's it's closing people in this in
[90:44] this little ghettos of the internet
[90:46] which doesn't let the information to be
[90:49] exchanged freely which limits our uh
[90:52] creativity and need to waste so much
[90:55] more time on uploading to Twitch on
[90:57] registering to YouTube payout program
[91:00] Etc yeah I I I'm also excited what you
[91:03] guys as content creators will create uh
[91:06] when this all becomes much much more
[91:08] open and
[91:10] easy I don't know if I change a lot uh I
[91:12] just like to have conversations I don't
[91:15] know if how this changes uh I I do uh I
[91:20] I I don't even do a lot of short form
[91:22] contents currently uh but yeah like we
[91:25] will will be fun to see how content uh
[91:28] changes once's algorithms and that
[91:31] things changes but we that's I'm really
[91:34] looking forward to that also um but yeah
[91:37] we we already one and a half hours in um
[91:40] one one question that I asked each and
[91:42] every one of my guests is what can we
[91:44] learn from you besides Bitcoin you mean
[91:46] like uh if somebody wants to call me and
[91:49] or learn from
[91:52] my my life uh it's interesting how this
[91:56] this question
[91:58] um maybe I have to rephrase it once but
[92:02] uh I I I want to get something outside
[92:05] of Bitcoin in there and whatever you
[92:08] want to add in here you you can add in
[92:10] here like from your personal life but
[92:12] also just a learning or a topic or
[92:15] whatever you want to share outside of
[92:18] Bitcoin that's the only reason
[92:21] okay I myself also a
[92:24] subscriber follower fan advocate for uh
[92:29] the philosophy of objectivism by in
[92:33] rent and it's it's you know 60 years
[92:36] older than Bitcoin uh but so many Mutual
[92:42] Concepts there are with Bitcoin
[92:43] maximalism that I'm a bit surprised
[92:45] while why Rand is not yet that popular
[92:50] among bitcoiners uh it will change uh I
[92:55] I'm I'm recommending anyone to check it
[92:58] out uh it's not just about free market
[93:02] and uh uh and capitalism uh but it's a
[93:07] structured coherent uh uh approach to
[93:11] life uh understanding uh what is good
[93:15] for you as a human being how to discover
[93:18] Truth
[93:20] uh what means uh to
[93:25] to uh take to drive your life uh
[93:29] properly philosophy uh where capitalism
[93:33] is just a little part of it uh it helps
[93:37] uh having such I guess people who maybe
[93:39] subscribe to some uh religions or or
[93:43] some other philosophies they can confirm
[93:46] that being able to uh structurize your
[93:51] um understanding of the world and
[93:53] approach and
[93:54] uh some code of morality really helps uh
[93:58] with
[93:59] life mostly because most of the actions
[94:02] that I do maybe even if they're not all
[94:05] of them critically uh considered from
[94:09] the perspective of objectivism
[94:12] philosophy or any
[94:14] philosophy I am convinced that uh what I
[94:18] do is uh both moral and practical uh I
[94:21] am I feel myself very coherent in life
[94:25] because I discovered uh what is good and
[94:29] what is bad uh for me it really helps to
[94:34] just Glide smoothly through life uh to
[94:37] discover some philosophy and if somebody
[94:40] uh would like to check it I really
[94:41] recommend reading a Rand virtue of
[94:44] selfishness uh uh out of her non-fiction
[94:47] work or romantic Manifesto which really
[94:50] uh help structurize lots of aspects of
[94:54] of life and thought interesting yeah I I
[94:57] love that and I I also love that the end
[95:00] routine of the podcast is now fitting
[95:02] really nicely with the optimism and
[95:04] stuff like that uh we have end in the
[95:07] podcast where the previous guest is
[95:08] asking a question for the next guest
[95:10] without knowing who the next guest
[95:11] actually is and your question is what is
[95:13] the biggest thing that Bitcoin does not
[95:15] fix biggest
[95:19] okay
[95:21] oh the limits of
[95:24] SpaceTime
[95:25] travel and the speed of light I guess we
[95:29] need we need some different means to
[95:31] break through this uh and if we actually
[95:33] dream as you mentioned about colonizing
[95:36] other worlds uh probably it uh wouldn't
[95:40] be possible without bypassing or somehow
[95:43] breaking the limits of the physics as we
[95:46] understand today and I don't think
[95:48] Bitcoin will help this help fix it it's
[95:51] on a uh much deeper level than Bitcoin
[95:55] fixes Bitcoin maybe comes out of this
[95:58] rules of physics but uh this this needs
[96:00] to be fixed elsewhere not sure if
[96:02] Humanity can do it I would love to see
[96:06] it during my lifetime because then it
[96:08] would be so much more interesting but it
[96:10] already is and I'm satisfied with this
[96:13] 300,000 kilometers per second and all of
[96:16] the uh different limits that come out of
[96:19] it absolutely really cool thank you so
[96:21] much Tomic for for being on the show ask
[96:23] a question to the next uh
[96:26] guest uh yes I usually wait uh uh till
[96:29] after the recording but uh you you can
[96:31] do it directly now like uh let's hear
[96:33] your question for the next guest oh but
