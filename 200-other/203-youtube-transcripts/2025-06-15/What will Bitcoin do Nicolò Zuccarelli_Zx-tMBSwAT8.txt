[00:00] Bitcoin never does what you expect it to
[00:02] do don't try to time market after the
[00:04] having we can be at like $20,000 but we
[00:08] can also be at
[00:09] $200,000 so I'm dedicating full time to
[00:12] to bitcoin this is where frustration
[00:14] comes from the pain might not yet be big
[00:16] enough Bitcoin can change something in
[00:19] society once you you see it you cannot
[00:22] un see it Bitcoin is the best formal
[00:25] collateral ever Ed the best global
[00:27] settlement layer
[00:30] what do you see as a bitcoiner like what
[00:33] what person is a is a bitcoiner do you
[00:35] think like what what uh attributes do go
[00:39] on and say this is a bitcoiner I think a
[00:42] bitcoiner needs to be a bit of a person
[00:44] that likes to think and not just uh you
[00:48] know let things uh come at him and uh
[00:51] let have this person like let be this
[00:53] person passive towards things uh but
[00:56] let's say if you and this can can happen
[00:59] in with whatever situation in life in
[01:02] work but um you know I think bitcoiners
[01:06] that don't know it yet that they are uh
[01:10] good bitcoiners uh are are people that
[01:13] like to take initiative of something
[01:16] take uh their own uh put like their
[01:20] efforts and their strength at the
[01:22] the availability of a project or an idea
[01:26] that they have and um you know that they
[01:30] try to to build their own careers uh to
[01:33] make things better for themselves and
[01:35] for those uh for their kids for their
[01:39] families um so I think probably these
[01:41] are the good uh kind of characteristics
[01:44] of a bitcoiner uh trying to you know
[01:47] being active nothing is is gifted I mean
[01:51] something can be gifted to you you can
[01:54] get get an Heritage from your family and
[01:56] stuff but in General Life uh
[02:00] it's complex no for everybody uh and uh
[02:03] everybody has its own challenges and uh
[02:07] it's it's up to how you uh reply and how
[02:11] you face these challenges that uh shows
[02:13] you also like who you are as a person
[02:17] yeah definitely in the challenge like in
[02:18] the in the hard times it shows your
[02:20] character um and for me it's always
[02:23] interesting how we are not at full
[02:25] adoption yet because uh inflation is
[02:28] high everything is is like putting on
[02:32] for Bitcoin uh but I also think that the
[02:35] pain just might be not enough for people
[02:38] to get in like so many people that get
[02:41] would would have the mindset as you
[02:43] described it to be a bitcoiner but
[02:45] they're not in Bitcoin yet they're still
[02:47] in the field world they're still maybe
[02:50] they have some ETFs maybe they have some
[02:52] stocks maybe they have even some gold uh
[02:55] but why are they not getting to be a
[02:58] bitcoiner what what do you think think
[02:59] is the big hurdle that uh people are now
[03:03] not a bitcoiner is the pain just not big
[03:07] enough well probably uh probably the
[03:10] pain might not yet be big enough and
[03:13] also maybe they I don't know for some
[03:16] reason they never got really attracted
[03:18] to bitcoin and they I mean if you just
[03:21] tend to follow things on on let's say
[03:24] General Media uh and whatever newspapers
[03:28] uh like the the the connotation that
[03:30] it's given to bitcoin tends to be like
[03:33] quite of the magical internet money uh
[03:37] so let's say if you if you don't invest
[03:40] the time uh to for some reason that
[03:43] somebody really uh like give some hints
[03:47] and say hey for your own uh for your own
[03:50] Wellness like you should look at this um
[03:54] like yeah it might be just as one of the
[03:57] many other things around us uh that you
[04:00] don't really focus on and you you
[04:02] continue to struggle on uh on everything
[04:04] you're doing um so yeah I think
[04:09] education is is the the main the main
[04:12] barriers to to entry for many people uh
[04:15] and and many of them
[04:17] also yeah tend to just give up when you
[04:20] try to explain maybe how Bitcoin works
[04:22] and blocks and uh subsidy and difficulty
[04:26] adjustment and things people get a bit
[04:28] uh scared that they cannot understand it
[04:32] while uh at the end it's uh it needs
[04:37] some some uh some some commitment to
[04:40] want it and then once uh once you you
[04:42] see it you cannot unse seee it so it's
[04:44] like it's like a filter that you put on
[04:46] yourself that changes everything about
[04:50] how you plan your life what are your
[04:53] priorities um and what you really want
[04:55] to focus your time and and energies on
[05:00] would you say that uh Bitcoin was uh
[05:03] fundamental in your life that something
[05:05] when you got Bitcoin
[05:08] change I mean in a way yes um you know
[05:12] as a proper Italian you know always like
[05:16] to have uh Fancy Shoes Fancy Pants fancy
[05:21] stuff and uh uh always hanging hanging
[05:25] out
[05:26] and you know spending good money in
[05:29] dinner drinks uh bottles at tables and
[05:33] and and other things and and at the end
[05:35] I don't know you you realize that I mean
[05:38] this this worked
[05:40] until until yeah you you realize Bitcoin
[05:44] and you realize that maybe it's not
[05:46] really worth to to throw money at many
[05:49] things and
[05:51] uh and and it's better to save for the
[05:54] future so definitely it changed me it it
[05:57] took me quite some time um um but uh
[06:02] it's a step that once once something
[06:05] really after 10 15 20 hours when
[06:07] something really does click and
[06:10] then uh everybody has its own aha moment
[06:15] to uh that gets it gets him or her into
[06:19] Bitcoin and then another word opens and
[06:23] and there it's where everything
[06:25] starts to to to make sense and then you
[06:28] get interested
[06:30] by the day and uh so yeah it it
[06:34] definitely uh you know changed my my
[06:37] approach to to life relationships and
[06:41] and many other things to work so yeah
[06:44] amazing and it's it's also like for me I
[06:46] always see that with with
[06:48] bitcoiners uh that get into Bitcoin and
[06:50] something changes but it's also
[06:52] interesting how people even get to
[06:54] bitcoin we talked before about how um
[06:57] somebody
[07:00] so many people are not getting into
[07:01] Bitcoin even though they should
[07:03] understand it and how the pain is not
[07:05] great enough and especially for
[07:07] bitcoiners that get
[07:09] Bitcoins already now where the pain is
[07:12] not extremely high for most people of
[07:15] course when we talk about Venezuela and
[07:18] Nigeria it's it's a different story but
[07:20] also there the adoption is way higher
[07:22] where more like 20 25 30% of adoption in
[07:26] countries like Austria Italy Where You
[07:29] Are goinging from or the western
[07:30] civilization we talking like 5 10
[07:34] maximum 15% in some areas adoption so
[07:38] this this pain thing definitely helps
[07:40] but the pain obviously is not as high in
[07:43] your circumstances like how how did you
[07:45] or why did you get involved in in in
[07:49] Bitcoin uh so well it was um I was
[07:54] recently moving from uh from my
[07:56] Barcelona studies to Luxembourg to to
[07:58] start my career into alternative funds
[08:01] uh and uh it was
[08:04] 2017 August 2017 so at the kind of the
[08:09] late stages of the 2017 Bull Run and uh
[08:13] yeah Bitcoin was always popping up on
[08:15] the news and I bought and did did some
[08:18] gains and sold like after a month month
[08:21] and a half and then yeah saw it
[08:24] declining and I was like ah that that
[08:26] was good I I entered and did my trade
[08:29] that I good time now this thing is
[08:31] probably dead and uh didn't Discover it
[08:34] back until late 2019 early
[08:38] 2020 um so yeah from from that moment it
[08:43] was the moment where I started investing
[08:46] and um and after a couple weeks it was a
[08:50] CO draw down so Bitcoin always teaches
[08:52] you like the hard way um like uh how how
[08:57] things work you you come in for the
[08:59] quick big profits and uh you get slapped
[09:01] in your face uh
[09:04] very very soon afterwards and uh and
[09:07] then you start realizing uh realizing
[09:10] many things and uh putting energies into
[09:15] like understanding what it really is uh
[09:18] podcast
[09:19] Twitter uh reading some books uh you
[09:22] know the classical the classical steps
[09:25] and uh I've orang fied quite some people
[09:27] in my journey in Lux work in you know
[09:30] traditional uh financial
[09:33] institutions uh colleagues uh ex-
[09:36] colleagues so uh then it's a journey and
[09:39] uh yeah you feel like
[09:43] you it's like if you if we are Sellers
[09:47] and we want to sell something to people
[09:49] despite we don't really gain from the
[09:51] direct sale of people and we are
[09:52] actually doing it because we we care
[09:54] about them you know um like if I would
[09:57] not care about uh the people me like I
[10:00] would not be um you know be talking
[10:04] about Bitcoin to them trying to explain
[10:06] it to them and let them
[10:08] understand uh that it's it's it's their
[10:11] way out for a probably better financial
[10:14] future so yeah definely it's it's it's
[10:18] someone if if you sell someone Bitcoin
[10:21] it's like selling someone on the idea of
[10:24] getting into sun like get out there do
[10:27] sun tanking uh work work out like you
[10:31] don't profit if someone else goes in the
[10:33] Sun or someone else uh works out you
[10:36] don't profit from that and uh you also
[10:39] don't profit if someone else comes in
[10:41] Bitcoin I
[10:42] mean if you see it really hard of course
[10:45] your investment gets a little bit
[10:47] stronger when you convince one more
[10:49] person into Bitcoin but uh in the end of
[10:53] the day does it just does not matter uh
[10:55] if you like you have to really orange
[10:58] peel a lot of people with a lot of money
[11:01] to even make a little bit of difference
[11:04] in in in the Bitcoin purchasing power uh
[11:08] which it's just not reachable for anyone
[11:12] uh in particular I think even even the
[11:15] really big guys like Michael saor or
[11:17] Jeff poof uh in the greatest scheme of
[11:20] things uh Bitcoin would not do so
[11:23] differently if they would not be there
[11:25] there would be some other Michael saor
[11:27] there would be some other Jeff poof
[11:28] there would be some other person in
[11:30] instead of them so uh even the really
[11:33] big guys we can make an argument are not
[11:36] that dramatically good for like they
[11:39] they're not that necessarily for for
[11:41] Bitcoin because there would be some
[11:42] someone else like this is something that
[11:44] humbles all the people because all of
[11:46] the sudden you're like a Bitcoin just
[11:49] does not meet me like I can do something
[11:52] in Bitcoin but it it does not need me
[11:54] really of course we can work in Bitcoin
[11:58] I can make a podcast Bitcoin which
[12:00] benefits me if people listen to me and
[12:02] then I can uh like maybe even live from
[12:05] that make this my my main thing uh in
[12:08] that way I can benefit from it but I
[12:11] cannot benefit from like directly
[12:13] Bitcoin uh price appreciation in in that
[12:16] regard yeah and you also talked about
[12:19] orange building where you're successful
[12:21] Orange Building is sometimes really a
[12:23] hard
[12:24] experience yeah I mean um I I would say
[12:28] so
[12:30] my 20 25 friends probably
[12:35] successfully orange build and you know
[12:38] that uh they they are after a bit like
[12:41] they start really asking you things and
[12:43] like when should I buy what should I do
[12:45] and how should I manage uh my stack or
[12:49] like shall I liquidate a bit now and I
[12:52] mean the replies uh for me are always
[12:55] kind of the same so stuck constantly and
[12:58] uh
[13:00] and possibly don't sell never
[13:03] so I yeah I I I think I was decently
[13:07] successful at Orange buing at the same
[13:10] time uh you know I've done also like
[13:13] some here uh three session three iners
[13:17] session here in Italy in my community uh
[13:20] videos are available on my on my channel
[13:22] on YouTube in Italian and um like with
[13:26] just you know basically family and
[13:28] friends and some some other uh
[13:30] connections um and uh I I got also here
[13:34] you
[13:35] know very good uh very good uh like
[13:39] response uh from them but I I don't I
[13:44] you know they they got some hints in how
[13:47] like what is money first of all like why
[13:50] the system might not work but some of
[13:53] them are still you know hesitant to to
[13:55] make the step and uh they're always like
[13:58] hey would you like to to manage things
[13:59] for me I give you money please manage
[14:02] but you know it's this is not part of
[14:05] the orange building like there are a lot
[14:07] of risks especially in Bitcoin involved
[14:09] in like s custody and and all the other
[14:14] Central topics and Central Key aspect of
[14:16] Bitcoin so orange billing can be easy uh
[14:20] decently easy to do depending on the
[14:22] person you have in front if it's a
[14:24] curious person and willing to to do
[14:29] stuff um so this and proactive this
[14:32] might happen easily if you have the
[14:35] person curious but that might be afraid
[14:38] of the technology or like how do I do
[14:40] this how do I do that yeah then then
[14:43] it's a half orange pill I would say so
[14:47] yeah yeah definitely those questions
[14:50] come a lot and this is also why I
[14:52] partnered up with with 21 Bitcoin and
[14:55] bitbox uh because people always ask me
[14:57] okay how how do I buy Bitcoin and how to
[14:59] store Bitcoin and basically I was like
[15:02] okay uh I want to have the most beginner
[15:05] friendly things and I just put it in my
[15:07] description I put it everywhere and then
[15:09] people then I can just say like go there
[15:12] that's that's that's what I recommend
[15:14] but you can do whatever you want and
[15:15] this is the important thing with Bitcoin
[15:18] you have to um take
[15:22] yourself uh seriously and take your own
[15:26] responsibility just because someone says
[15:28] like oh go there use you can store your
[15:30] Bitcoin there you can buy them there
[15:33] it's not necessarily the best way for
[15:34] you like it's maybe just the way that he
[15:37] recommends for new beginners but maybe
[15:39] uh you should have a different setup you
[15:41] should uh buy differently maybe you want
[15:43] to do different stuff like it's um we
[15:46] have to learn to take s responsibility
[15:48] and this also brings me to the my next
[15:50] question uh which I am deeply convinced
[15:53] about that Bitcoin can change something
[15:57] in society uh it's just a matter of how
[16:00] much and and how how big the impact of
[16:04] of of that will be because you also say
[16:06] like Bitcoin in puts like kind of a
[16:09] filter on on yourself and on on the
[16:11] world um what do you think will like
[16:15] before we get into this what do you
[16:17] think of society right now or like the
[16:19] last couple of uh decades uh if we are
[16:22] like in a Decay or like how did you how
[16:25] do you see it and what do you think will
[16:27] Bitcoin then do to to us moving forward
[16:31] uh in a in a greater scheme of
[16:33] things yeah so I mean I I think it's
[16:37] kind of undeniable from from anyone that
[16:40] Society has been in a in a kind of Decay
[16:44] uh from yeah for the last 20 30 maybe
[16:49] 53 years since uh 1971 who knows but uh
[16:54] definitely from around that time um
[16:57] because I don't know the there is a
[16:59] general erosion of what are what are the
[17:03] main uh values that you know a society
[17:07] and people should have like uh focus on
[17:10] the focus on relationships on family on
[17:14] the concept of family or on the concept
[17:16] of money or on the concept of um you
[17:20] know uh work and uh all this um of
[17:24] religion for instance like there are so
[17:27] many things that uh I I felt and so many
[17:30] values that I feel have been lost a bit
[17:34] on on the way and uh everybody now is
[17:38] focused on just you know using like uh
[17:41] social apps uh whatever their age is
[17:44] whether they are younger generation or
[17:46] even like older people uh I
[17:50] mean it's they they are always on on
[17:53] social network uh doing trips and
[17:56] travels to just post things going to
[17:58] restaurants just
[17:59] post their meals and their new clothes
[18:03] and it's very kind of short termism just
[18:08] to to buy something or to do something
[18:11] to show it to to other people so and of
[18:14] course as as as bitcoiners we we all
[18:17] believe that indeed this is uh this is
[18:20] linked to money uh like money that that
[18:22] depreciates in value quickly you're not
[18:25] doesn't not incentivize you to to save
[18:28] it but rather to spend it um and and
[18:31] probably yeah this is uh this is where
[18:33] we are at now and so I I I want to be
[18:38] hopeful uh that indeed like
[18:41] uh uh like Bitcoin uh brings back some
[18:46] uh uh some good values uh in society I
[18:50] mean also yeah a bit from the the for
[18:54] turning book uh like uh we we should be
[18:58] in those in those years where uh some
[19:01] some major uh you know some major upal
[19:05] in the in society via who knows at the
[19:10] economic level or at you
[19:13] know geopolitical level would trigger
[19:16] like some some big changes uh and that
[19:19] afterwards like these big changes I mean
[19:22] this big event uh big impact event would
[19:25] then trigger changes in in the in
[19:28] Society afterwards and uh I don't know
[19:32] it feels like a bit all the all the
[19:34] cards and the all the pieces of the
[19:38] puzzle are are putting them together uh
[19:40] covid and Russia attacking Ukraine and
[19:44] now like also the other conflict in um
[19:48] in Israel so it feels like a lot of
[19:51] things are are just uh putting go in
[19:54] line uh for for a big mess to to follow
[19:58] by without even mentioning you know the
[20:00] the financial side of things uh I come
[20:03] from Bitcoin I come to bitcoin from a
[20:05] you know a traditional Finance
[20:08] background uh so I I tend to understand
[20:12] maybe better than than some others which
[20:14] are different backgrounds uh
[20:19] how situation from an economical point
[20:21] of view uh on inflation on in debth
[20:26] levels and interest rate to the and like
[20:31] all which which are affecting Society
[20:35] from a deep level so yeah and definitely
[20:40] and it makes something with the human
[20:42] brain If because people
[20:45] trust still the US Dollars the Euro the
[20:49] Fiat currencies especially those who are
[20:53] not 100% well educated about finances
[20:56] and not aware of of the problem they are
[20:59] trusting that the value of the currency
[21:02] the money that they have even though
[21:04] it's not money for me but they think of
[21:06] this money uh holds their value long
[21:10] term and they see and they learn
[21:13] instinctively that it doesn't so even
[21:16] though they don't notice it because it's
[21:18] slow and not really fast they notice it
[21:22] uh on a on a deeper level and so they
[21:25] are incentivized to spend and to consume
[21:28] more so then uh yeah they like yeah we
[21:32] have to be in the red race and we are
[21:34] doing more and more and it's it's
[21:35] nothing nothing shows for us and this um
[21:39] this is where frustration I think also
[21:41] comes from and and depressions also come
[21:42] from not not only from that but I think
[21:45] this is a a big source of that when
[21:48] people don't have money because money is
[21:50] a big problem if if you if you run out
[21:52] of money in your life
[21:55] um other problems seem small like you
[21:59] you money is where we are exchanging
[22:02] time to each other and then this is
[22:04] something you you want to have more of
[22:06] and not less of and it's uh it's it's
[22:09] it's sometimes sad to see that the
[22:11] people that need Bitcoin the most don't
[22:14] don't see it even even really rich
[22:16] people don't see Bitcoin uh or even
[22:19] argue against it but I don't care for
[22:21] them too much uh because they will see
[22:23] it eventually and if if they go under or
[22:26] they they yeah their stack gets halfed
[22:30] or qu or like cut in in four pieces it
[22:34] doesn't matter that much because they
[22:35] have so much but uh on on the Lower Side
[22:38] they should have way more Bitcoin they
[22:40] should get in Bitcoin early and it's
[22:42] like something that I I think the
[22:44] podcast went out today about how Bitcoin
[22:48] will help especially um the lower class
[22:52] of of the society um and you also wrote
[22:55] an interesting article about uh um bit
[22:58] bonds uh on on on on LinkedIn I checked
[23:02] also like what you wrote there and it
[23:04] was really really cool to see uh the
[23:06] topic of Bitcoin bonds I think Salvador
[23:08] also has Bitcoin bonds um for for people
[23:11] that don't know about Bitcoin bonds or
[23:14] even maybe don't even know about bonds
[23:16] uh what is the this and what are Bitcoin
[23:21] bonds uh bond is just a contractual
[23:24] obligation is a contract that
[23:26] guarantees uh uh certain
[23:29] uh borrower to uh give funds to to take
[23:33] funds um and and to use these funds for
[23:36] its own corporate initiative or
[23:39] government initiatives and then uh it's
[23:41] paid back a certain coupon over the life
[23:44] of the bond and uh plus the the nominal
[23:47] interest the nominal value of the bond
[23:50] at the end and so by starting from this
[23:54] uh you know from this Theory uh like
[23:56] everybody um as Always In traditional
[23:59] Financial Bo has always used this
[24:01] instrument to
[24:02] allocate big portion of of traditional
[24:05] institutional
[24:07] portfolios um because bonds uh you know
[24:10] were providing also that diversification
[24:12] benefits uh when you were when equities
[24:15] were not doing that that well um but and
[24:19] bonds have been in a in a like interest
[24:21] rate have been trending down for a very
[24:23] long time so in this way uh like prices
[24:27] of bonds are in verely correlated so to
[24:30] to interest rates so interest rate
[24:32] declining means uh bond prices are
[24:34] rising and so institutions in the since
[24:38] the 70s the 80s uh after Volare raised
[24:41] the interest rate to about 20% to T
[24:44] inflation have been in a Perpetual bull
[24:47] market and uh but now things uh have
[24:51] been have been changing you know uh
[24:53] interest rate in 20 end of 21 beginning
[24:56] of 22 has started Rising and um like the
[25:00] the real interest rate that Bond holders
[25:02] were getting on their bonds was negative
[25:04] so meaning they were they were uh yeah
[25:09] lending funds to somebody else to then
[25:11] be paid uh to lose money basically uh so
[25:15] it's not it's not an investment anymore
[25:17] and uh and uh Bitcoin integrating
[25:20] Bitcoin in a in a bond in a bond
[25:22] contract could be actually that uh that
[25:25] part that U only a small portion of
[25:28] course depending on the issuer's uh uh
[25:32] willingness and also on the on the
[25:34] potential buyer of the bond um you can
[25:38] have like a a five to 10% allocation of
[25:41] that bond to bitcoin so held in as held
[25:47] as a collateral of the bond which can
[25:49] improve the credit rating of the
[25:51] issuer um which would back the bond with
[25:55] the hard assets uh and that indeed could
[25:59] uh the appreciation of Bitcoin could
[26:03] indeed B basically level out the what is
[26:08] like the depreciation of the currency
[26:09] and from inflation so in this way could
[26:12] be a win-win for um both the the issuer
[26:16] of the bond and the bond buyer and it
[26:19] could really uh you know um restabilize
[26:23] some some and Link back uh some of the
[26:27] the depth levels to some hard assets and
[26:29] what is El Salvador is doing actually
[26:32] I'm not sure whether they effectively
[26:34] launched the bond yet or not but indeed
[26:37] they wanted to do their volcano bonds uh
[26:40] where this was kind of the they would
[26:43] follow the same structure and they would
[26:46] create their they would mine their bonds
[26:49] their Bitcoin via VI the volcano energy
[26:53] uh so yeah it it's definitely a a good
[26:56] strategy a very forward looking strategy
[26:59] to you know put to work stranded energy
[27:02] of your country transforming it into
[27:04] capital and use this Capital
[27:06] International Capital Global Capital to
[27:10] uh to back adapt Insurance to do things
[27:13] in your country
[27:15] so definitely a a a very nice approach
[27:20] amazing yeah and it's it's for me always
[27:22] fascinating to see uh where Bitcoin gets
[27:25] more and more integrated in all those
[27:27] financial systems uh and we have seen it
[27:31] now with the Bitcoin e def we have seen
[27:33] it before uh with Salvador making it
[27:36] legal tender uh then before we have seen
[27:39] it with Michael saor and Micha strategy
[27:42] the first publicly traded company to put
[27:44] it on a balance sheet uh and there are
[27:46] so many more milestones in the in the in
[27:49] the past we have seen Bitcoin gets
[27:52] adopted in uh yeah Financial um product
[27:57] in something that's already existing
[28:00] because it's such a great idea and
[28:01] people will think how can I integrate
[28:04] that great idea in my
[28:08] environment like micr strategy in the
[28:10] company with Sal and the bonds uh with
[28:14] ETFs and black r with like having a
[28:17] Bitcoin ETF and this all is really
[28:20] really cool it's not necessary to have
[28:22] but it's consequential to happen because
[28:26] Bitcoin is sound money so it also fires
[28:30] then up the next wave of adoptions and
[28:33] this is kind of my next question um do
[28:36] you see uh structur products the bit
[28:39] Bitcoin ETFs and the the bonds and all
[28:42] those things uh happening uh as like the
[28:46] the next wave of Bitcoin adoption where
[28:49] this whole financial system that's the
[28:51] Fiat system basically is now saying oh
[28:54] should this this Bitcoin thing is not
[28:56] going away we have this for for longer
[29:00] let's integrate it in our financial
[29:01] systems and in that way is acting kind
[29:04] of like a troan horse for the financial
[29:07] system because everybody wants a piece
[29:09] of the fees and everything uh and the
[29:12] price appreciation and it's kind of
[29:16] peacefully revolutionizing the system
[29:19] from within because people are like ah
[29:21] let's let's let's get Bitcoin inside
[29:23] let's GA us some fees let's GA us some
[29:26] price appreciation is it like that
[29:29] see I mean for sure like uh in the
[29:33] Bitcoin space we have been saying for
[29:34] quite some years that uh like
[29:36] institutions are here and uh but
[29:38] institutions were never really here
[29:40] until probably with the with the big
[29:42] ETFs apart from indeed as you mentioned
[29:45] like micro strategy or Tesla or some
[29:48] other like uh you know smaller players
[29:51] smaller and isolated players uh so yeah
[29:55] I mean at the at the end Bitcoin is the
[29:57] is the the best uh you know is in is an
[30:01] asset class in and of itself is the best
[30:03] form of collateral ever embeded uh is
[30:06] the best global settlement layer like
[30:09] ever invented uh so I think it's it's
[30:13] quite natural that it will take it will
[30:16] be it will become uh like a a go-to item
[30:22] for like uh many financial and
[30:25] nonfinancial companies uh uh in the in
[30:28] the in the world and um you know the
[30:32] with the with the ETFs now big
[30:34] institutions will use uh ETFs and other
[30:37] and create other Bitcoin products uh to
[30:40] to use as collateral to lend money
[30:43] against uh or you know many other
[30:48] Integrations uh will happen with with AI
[30:51] uh and the fact that you can uh with
[30:54] lighning payments you can you can let uh
[30:58] users pay directly for the AI services
[31:01] that they are using and instead of
[31:03] creating like big chunk of uh closed
[31:07] Source uh AI platform you could create
[31:10] an open source AI platform uh that you
[31:13] can just pay uh for for what you really
[31:16] use uh or like all the uh micro payments
[31:21] that you can apply to uh to to X
[31:24] accounts and to to
[31:26] verify uh that you're actually that
[31:29] you're actually not a bot by spending
[31:31] like quarter of cents every now and
[31:35] then or like everything uh really like
[31:38] all the everything that phonetime app is
[31:41] doing on the streaming uh like sat
[31:45] streaming uh or like uh really uh when
[31:49] you do some some some sort of like uh
[31:53] sat Insurance you know for everybody
[31:56] which does uh uh like kind of extreme
[31:59] sports or skiing or other things like
[32:02] imagine having the possibility to stream
[32:06] uh part of your SATs on on the lightning
[32:08] network uh just in those moment to the
[32:11] insurance company to to get coverage so
[32:14] I mean I I think these are just uh some
[32:17] of the some of the possibilities and
[32:20] some of the possible Integrations that
[32:22] are there nowadays just on bitcoin you
[32:25] know the the Monet asset then of course
[32:29] there is a full and complete other
[32:31] Rabbit Hole related to to Mining and uh
[32:35] how it can be how it can be integrated
[32:38] into energy any Energy company and into
[32:42] many other uh many other Industries like
[32:46] in Finland they are they're studying
[32:49] like um District eating uh than with
[32:52] with Bitcoin miners in the Netherlands
[32:55] they were doing this they were using um
[32:58] waste heat from miners to to heat green
[33:02] houses to grow tulips and other
[33:05] vegetables and
[33:07] uh I mean I think at both at corporate
[33:11] level and state
[33:12] level as soon as uh yeah some people uh
[33:17] will will uh do the work spend their 50
[33:20] 100 hours into understanding Bitcoin uh
[33:23] I'm I'm very confident that uh yeah it
[33:27] will be it will be integrated uh in in
[33:30] any sector of of the economy you know 21
[33:33] Bitcoin is Bitcoin only from day one and
[33:36] they teach and preach self- custody this
[33:39] is my goto exchange when someone asks me
[33:43] oh where can I buy my Bitcoin from this
[33:45] is the easiest entry for bitcoiners and
[33:48] if you want lower fees Plus at the same
[33:51] time support this podcast use code Robin
[33:54] and click the link in the description
[33:56] yeah 100% it's it's amazing I had Lisa
[33:59] half on like 10 15 20 or even 30
[34:03] episodes ago I don't know exactly what
[34:05] the episode number was uh and she's
[34:08] talking about monetizing every last
[34:11] molecule uh of electricity uh from the
[34:15] energy companies and she's talking
[34:16] actually about how the next wave of
[34:18] Bitcoin adoption will come from the
[34:21] Bitcoin miners because the Bitcoin m not
[34:24] the Bitcoin miners are from the uh
[34:26] energy companies because the energy
[34:28] companies have actually pay sometimes
[34:32] for things to store for their sources to
[34:35] store because they cannot use them and
[34:37] if they see that they can use the energy
[34:41] just mine Bitcoin and get actually money
[34:43] for that uh that's amazing it's similar
[34:46] to what happened with crude oil in the
[34:49] in the co area where when you have those
[34:53] future contracts running out and then
[34:56] all of a sudden you had take the the
[34:59] crude oil in your own in your own
[35:01] custody basically uh you basically have
[35:04] to pay for crude oil do if you have it
[35:07] it's yeah crazy crazy story in in the
[35:10] corona time um and this is kind of like
[35:15] uh weird to think of but the energy
[35:17] companies have a lot of possibilities to
[35:20] mine Bitcoin like there will be I mean
[35:23] the the hash rate is going up parabolic
[35:25] since since the beginning basically
[35:28] the chart looks like a straight line up
[35:31] it's really interesting to see um but
[35:33] yeah it's also interesting how this all
[35:35] shapes up with with Bitcoin miners with
[35:38] with the energy companies adopting it
[35:40] and it's it's will be interesting how we
[35:42] can capture otherwise wasted energy uh
[35:46] and put it in Bitcoin
[35:49] basically that's really really really
[35:51] cool everything related to all the
[35:54] renewable energy transitions that uh
[35:57] that uh the the governments like are
[36:00] really pushing for and I'm I'm a I'm
[36:04] a I believe in climate change I I think
[36:08] climate climate is really changing uh I
[36:10] I I also believe with that we are
[36:12] underestimating in the short term what
[36:14] could happen but we are um we are
[36:16] overestimating in the short term what
[36:18] could happen but we are underestimating
[36:20] it in the long term and uh like now
[36:23] everybody believes that everything
[36:24] should happens with the EV and uh and uh
[36:27] removing base load energy such as coal
[36:30] and nuclear and replacing it with with
[36:32] wind and solar Farms like it happened in
[36:34] Germany for instance and then like this
[36:37] these projects cannot cannot really
[36:39] stand by themselves without government
[36:41] subsidies so the only way
[36:43] to uh well in the past it was not really
[36:46] possible to do anything else you cannot
[36:48] build a steel factory or any other like
[36:51] Factory which needs like a constant
[36:53] power to run because this this uh
[36:56] sources of energy are not
[36:58] base loads so they are Peak capacity and
[37:01] now you have a per the perfect buyer of
[37:04] of any stranded electricity which fix
[37:08] you a price and pay and pays it and can
[37:12] turn on and off in in three minutes an
[37:14] entire plant
[37:16] so and it directly in like monetize the
[37:21] source of energy so I think it's really
[37:25] mindblowing uh when you think about the
[37:27] possibilities so yeah it's it's amazing
[37:31] and uh we we talked about bonds and we
[37:34] talked about miners uh and both is kind
[37:37] of related to to El Salvador and I also
[37:40] recently saw NB giving out free
[37:44] passports for skilled people uh which is
[37:46] an amazing move this the whole game
[37:49] theory with with um uh nation states
[37:52] adopting Bitcoin and being on a global
[37:54] scale also with a marketing uh point of
[37:57] you for for that space is is amazing
[38:01] what what did you thought of of of N bua
[38:03] and and maybe your general thoughts on
[38:05] El
[38:06] Salvador I was in Salvador actually in
[38:09] in January uh did the two weeks
[38:12] backpacking there and um didn't just uh
[38:16] go like in you know Bitcoin Beach Elon
[38:20] and El tunco but traveled a bit around
[38:23] uh and and it's quite it's quite a nice
[38:25] country they have a lot of uh a lot of
[38:28] activities to do especially
[38:30] hikes and Hiking volcanoes and like we
[38:34] hiked water climbed waterfalls and and
[38:38] did other very good things um so it's I
[38:42] I think you know
[38:44] buele it's is doing his own he's
[38:48] bringing forward this uh his program uh
[38:50] which I think I don't think many of the
[38:52] people actually understood yet uh
[38:55] clearly um and uh everybody was was very
[38:59] glad uh not really about the the Bitcoin
[39:03] uh the Bitcoin stuff that he made but uh
[39:05] because he was finally able to uh to
[39:09] remove the gangs from the streets and to
[39:11] to allow everybody to know have a life
[39:14] being able to walk the day in the night
[39:17] and dress up as they want and not being
[39:20] uh not risk of uh of being uh robbed or
[39:25] murdered by by by some somebody else
[39:28] because they didn't like the color of
[39:29] your shoes
[39:31] so I think things are changing and uh bu
[39:34] is really playing a bit the you know the
[39:37] sovereign individual Theory explained uh
[39:41] like in the 1997 book um and uh yeah I
[39:46] mean at the end if you if you if you're
[39:48] a country and you put low taxes low to
[39:52] zero taxes you
[39:54] incentivize uh people to come to your
[39:57] count
[39:58] uh you don't want to steal their
[40:00] productivity uh via taxation um you are
[40:05] attracting you're putting yourself as a
[40:07] as a Global Talent platform where like
[40:11] uh you incentivize people to come and to
[40:13] build their own uh to build their own
[40:15] life um I live in Italy and uh
[40:20] Italy is a it's a beautiful country we
[40:24] have many beautiful things beautiful
[40:26] places great food and beautiful stuff
[40:29] but uh we have the probably the highest
[40:33] taxation in the world like you I still I
[40:37] still don't really understand how people
[40:39] can can can make and meet here because
[40:43] it's it's it's very complex luckily we
[40:46] are we are a you know we are a country
[40:48] of of of Savers we are a country with
[40:51] with a quite High uh home ownership rate
[40:55] uh so
[40:57] of course uh you're not directly pushed
[40:59] into the streets like in in many other
[41:01] countries which like
[41:03] UK or or nor Europe where uh you tend to
[41:09] rent uh but yeah uh Italy is definitely
[41:14] not uh attracting global global talents
[41:18] as as as m is doing and it's it's a he's
[41:22] playing the long game and uh I'm very
[41:25] confident in his plan so
[41:28] yeah what's going on in in Italy with
[41:30] with with Bitcoin uh do do you have uh
[41:34] some some politicians in in Bitcoin that
[41:37] are vocal about it do we have some
[41:39] meetups like how is the Bitcoin adoption
[41:42] going in in
[41:44] Italy that I've lived for for quite some
[41:47] time in uh in Luxembourg and I always
[41:50] tended to follow uh to follow the the
[41:53] International Community more than the
[41:55] Italian Community in specific
[41:58] actually the Italian Community in
[41:59] Bitcoin is the second one the second
[42:01] biggest one in Europe after
[42:04] Germany um and uh there are quite some
[42:07] activities um in the especially in the
[42:10] in the north of Italy like little Meetup
[42:12] here and there uh I'm not I'm not really
[42:16] aware of uh maybe just because I'm I'm
[42:20] not super knowledgeable of this but it
[42:22] actually exists already of politicians
[42:26] uh you know bring bringing Bitcoin into
[42:28] their agendas we are not unfortunately
[42:31] that much forward looking and uh but
[42:34] yeah uh ja Mo Zuko and Federico Revy and
[42:39] uh Ricky and uh there are many many
[42:43] Italians which are doing a very good job
[42:46] uh in in spreading the word uh on
[42:49] Twitter creating also like alternative
[42:52] website where you can you can find
[42:54] information in local language
[42:57] uh so yeah I think the community is
[43:00] building we we are in a good momentum
[43:02] Well everybody's in a good momentum
[43:04] price has has finally started Rising
[43:07] again so it become easier also to us to
[43:10] know talk Bitcoin to people while in the
[43:12] last two years everybody was like yeah I
[43:15] don't want to know about that Bitcoin
[43:16] thing that lost 70%
[43:20] so yeah yeah it's uh now we're up like
[43:24] the last year some 12 30% or something
[43:27] like that uh and people start listening
[43:30] again to bitcoin it's fascinating how
[43:33] the price is still the most effective
[43:36] marketing tool and uh the last topic I
[43:38] want to cover today is uh you also
[43:41] covered it I think on LinkedIn when I
[43:43] remember correctly and Michael saor was
[43:46] talking about it and it's every cycle
[43:50] it's a topic uh it's like Michael saor
[43:53] calls it the gold rush over the next 10
[43:55] years to bitcoin
[43:57] uh in the last Cycles it was like the
[44:00] theory of the super cycle do we have a
[44:02] super cycle this cycle because this
[44:04] cycle is different than all the other
[44:06] Cycles um and you also wrote about the
[44:08] Gold Rush probably inspired by Michael
[44:10] sailor um what what do you think can can
[44:14] the ETF and the this cycle because it's
[44:16] the first cycle where we uh actually hit
[44:20] the the new alltime high before the
[44:22] Haring which was never there before
[44:24] there actually something that's that's
[44:26] different to the other Cycles uh can we
[44:29] actually hit like a super cycle where we
[44:30] are going up every year uh for like 10
[44:34] years or like for even longer or like
[44:36] break this three years up one year down
[44:39] four year kind of cycle starting from
[44:43] the fact that Bitcoin never does what
[44:45] you expect it to do uh I mean it's it's
[44:48] very difficult to kind of to to predict
[44:50] no so I I think the kind of the the
[44:55] cycle will remain at least for the next
[44:58] couple hings uh because there will still
[45:00] be a somehow
[45:03] significant part of
[45:05] Bitcoin uh to be mind and uh the Gold
[45:09] Rush should indeed uh take place until
[45:12] 20 34 which is half of the in the next
[45:17] two hings uh where up until basically
[45:21] there will be just the last 1% of the
[45:24] Bitcoin to be mined in the six years
[45:27] approximately so I think um yeah I I
[45:33] link a lot the Cycles also to uh like
[45:36] human action and human feelings and uh
[45:40] all the Euphoria disbelief and greed and
[45:45] like all these emotions that take part
[45:48] of people uh I don't I don't really
[45:50] think uh we change that much after you
[45:54] are two three 10x on your investment
[45:58] uh you are tempted to maybe take some
[46:02] chips off the table or or
[46:04] to you know try to lend part of it out
[46:09] and like or speculate that it will
[46:11] appreciate more and you go leverage long
[46:14] on on some bets so I think uh I don't
[46:17] know this will not change and U even
[46:21] though like the effect of Institutions
[46:23] uh they are they are quite uh let's say
[46:26] special
[46:28] uh special monster in a way uh because
[46:31] at the end they are most of them at
[46:34] least that we know are listed on the
[46:35] public markets they they are very
[46:38] shortterm Focus so every quarter every
[46:42] end of the quarter every end of the year
[46:44] probably if they have done 40 50 70% or
[46:47] more on their Bitcoin they will try to
[46:50] sell and to show like positive results
[46:53] and then maybe buy again so there could
[46:55] be like some hicups here and there um
[46:59] yeah I don't know I think I think the
[47:02] the the kind of the the structure uh of
[47:07] of the upsides and downsides of the
[47:09] cycle more or less will remain at least
[47:11] for the next uh two rounds then who
[47:14] knows when we when we reach maybe in 10
[47:17] years we will reach like a billion
[47:19] people maybe more uh so which would be
[47:24] like what 15% of the of the global
[47:27] population so yeah maybe by then things
[47:30] would really change but I don't see it
[47:32] changing now so what's your view on this
[47:36] it's interesting I don't know uh it's it
[47:39] it feels very different uh it's now made
[47:43] whole cycle through because I came in
[47:45] with 20 in 2020 with that cycle uh and
[47:50] the power the Bitcoin has and the the
[47:54] backing that Bitcoin has is just way
[47:57] greater than four years ago like so many
[48:01] like we have four years ago the first
[48:03] publicly traded company with mic sale
[48:05] micro strategy came in now we have like
[48:08] 80 or 70 or 90 or something like that
[48:11] publicly traded companies in America
[48:13] that are in Bitcoin all around the world
[48:15] it's like similar Trend where more and
[48:17] more publicly traded company come in
[48:20] Bitcoin four years ago we did not had
[48:22] any nation state even saying Bitcoin as
[48:26] anything thing like that now we have a
[48:28] nation state that is almost as big as
[48:30] Austria uh with a leader who post
[48:34] about Bitcoin on Twitter like that's
[48:36] that's that's pretty hilarious I love
[48:38] that that is happening and that we are
[48:40] in a time to be alive in in like to be
[48:43] alive in this stage of of time uh and uh
[48:48] this is and we have even have like
[48:50] speculation about new countries we have
[48:52] Argentina an extremely big country that
[48:55] has now an leader that says abolish the
[48:57] central banks which is
[49:00] fantastic uh I know he's not 100%
[49:03] bitcoiner he just wants a free market
[49:05] and obviously in the free market Bitcoin
[49:07] will rise uh so if it's actually
[49:10] implemented as a free market uh so we
[49:12] have so many great forces going on that
[49:15] we did not have going on four years ago
[49:19] but this could be said about any
[49:21] fouryear cycle like every fouryear cycle
[49:24] Bitcoin was so much stronger
[49:27] uh in the end of at the beginning of the
[49:29] foure cycle than the beginning of the
[49:32] last foure cycle so I don't know like I
[49:35] don't try to do price predictions I just
[49:37] know that I will DCA into Bitcoin uh
[49:41] till it's the base layer of our monetary
[49:45] uh system and then I will DCA into
[49:47] Bitcoin because I get paid in Bitcoin so
[49:49] till I get paid in Fiat currencies I
[49:52] will buy Bitcoin with it and when I'm
[49:54] not getting paid in Fiat currencies I
[49:56] get paid in Bitcoin and I keep my
[49:58] Bitcoin stack at some point I might uh
[50:02] Tinker around with stocks and businesses
[50:04] more uh because at some point Bitcoin
[50:07] just gets boring and it's just the
[50:09] global Reserve asset we all use so then
[50:14] I might be interested in speculating a
[50:16] little bit more than uh than now but now
[50:19] right now only focus is is Bitcoin so I
[50:22] don't know uh it's it's an interesting
[50:24] topic uh I heard so many different
[50:27] opinions already on the podcast because
[50:28] I like to also talk about topic about
[50:32] the uh on the podcast uh from now it's
[50:36] around a week till the Haring when this
[50:39] podcast comes out it's probably the
[50:41] Haring already went by uh so we are
[50:43] already from the 6.25 to the
[50:46] 3.125 um yeah let's see what's happens
[50:50] uh the the biggest takeaway for everyone
[50:52] that's listening especially if you're a
[50:54] little bit newer to the game uh uh don't
[50:57] try to time the market like we can we
[51:00] can be after the Haring we can be at
[51:03] like 20,000 doll but we can also be at
[51:06] $200,000 us like there's both can happen
[51:12] really
[51:14] quickly there can be a 100K candle a day
[51:17] I don't think it will happen but
[51:20] possibly could happen with a lot of
[51:21] things happening at the same time
[51:23] Bitcoin does weird things at some points
[51:26] so yeah just just keep your TCA plan and
[51:30] stack SATs and keep calm enjoy the show
[51:34] enjoy the ride it's it's what a time to
[51:35] be alive it's love to love to be alive
[51:39] in this this
[51:42] area don't time uh don't try to time the
[51:45] market but uh timing the market is the
[51:48] most so yeah don't don't uh don't try to
[51:51] time the market but uh time in the
[51:54] market is as also Warren Buffett was was
[51:57] saying like is is probably the best
[51:59] strategy uh for Bitcoin like uh things
[52:02] are going up and down um and uh you said
[52:06] we don't know if it will be 20K or 200k
[52:09] after theing if it would be somewhere
[52:11] around 20K would be a last blessing
[52:14] before we really shoot up and we go to
[52:18] uh to like six digits so who knows yeah
[52:23] always good to keep some some cash on
[52:25] the side uh potentially to to to to buy
[52:28] some dips so this always good to do
[52:31] definitely I would love
[52:33] it um for my last question what are you
[52:37] currently
[52:38] stud like what's the main thing that you
[52:43] now well so yeah I I left my Fiat job in
[52:49] end of November December so I'm I'm
[52:52] really focused on Bitcoin now and I
[52:55] would like to contribute uh to to a
[52:57] Bitcoin to a Bitcoin company so
[53:01] I'm I'm getting informed uh like and
[53:04] dedicating fulltime to to bitcoin there
[53:06] is nothing not no specific topic I would
[53:09] say that I'm really focused on uh I try
[53:12] to understand a bit more everything
[53:13] which is happening on the more technical
[53:15] level even though I'm not really uh with
[53:18] a technical background at all uh trying
[53:21] so trying to understand like what uh
[53:23] what are what are deps working on and um
[53:27] oput and ctvs and and other you know
[53:31] upgrades to the to the network and at
[53:34] the same time I'm also trying to
[53:36] understand to like all the the good
[53:39] things of um everything which is
[53:41] happening uh from a monetary side and
[53:46] and fiscal side from States from
[53:47] government trying to understand it from
[53:49] a like in a Bitcoin lens and how Bitcoin
[53:52] could could benefit this so it's really
