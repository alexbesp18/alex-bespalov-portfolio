[00:00] Bitcoin is the most important topic,
[00:03] most important discovery in the
[00:05] universe. Nobody is bullish enough.
[00:07] People cannot grasp how big the
[00:09] opportunity of Bitcoin actually is. It's
[00:11] not just 8 billion people that will
[00:14] compete for the 21 million Bitcoin. It's
[00:17] also 185 nation states, how many
[00:20] companies they are, they will all want
[00:23] Bitcoin. We'll also have billions of AI
[00:26] agents that all want to get paid in
[00:27] Bitcoin. Bitcoin might be the next world
[00:30] reserve currency. What else would I buy?
[00:33] But I'm not risking losing out on one
[00:36] Bitcoin being like a hund00 million. Why
[00:39] would I do that? If you want to save
[00:41] something for 100 is 200 years. You want
[00:44] something nobody can control. Nobody can
[00:46] print more of. And then the question is
[00:48] like what are you going to
[00:50] do? What an amazing intro to this
[00:53] podcast. I unfortunately cannot take
[00:56] credit for this. This was the work of
[00:58] John to that hosted the podcast where I
[01:00] was guest on and this was one of my most
[01:03] favorite episodes I've ever been on
[01:05] featured. So I was like I should share
[01:08] that with you because I think you will
[01:10] really enjoy what we have talked about
[01:13] and where the conversation went. So
[01:16] please go ahead sit back relax and enjoy
[01:19] this one hour of podcast. All right
[01:21] Robin Ser this is awesome. I'm a huge
[01:23] fan of yours. Thanks so much for being
[01:24] on the show. Hi John. Thanks so much for
[01:26] being on. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks so much for
[01:27] being here. Getting me on. Sorry. Right.
[01:30] Yeah. You're used to being on the other
[01:31] side. So for anyone who doesn't know,
[01:32] Robin does an interview show on YouTube.
[01:34] It interviews a Bitcoiner every day, 365
[01:37] days out of the year. So check that out
[01:38] if anyone hasn't seen it. I'm sure most
[01:39] people have seen it um because you've
[01:41] been out there doing it for a while. But
[01:42] thank you so much for being on. We'll
[01:44] talk a little bit more about that part
[01:45] later. But the first question is Robin,
[01:47] what's your favorite thing about
[01:48] Bitcoin? The favorite thing about
[01:50] Bitcoin is something that also annoys me
[01:51] at Bitcoin sometimes. Uh it is something
[01:56] um I'm I'm getting to it. But the the
[01:58] thing where the favorite thing about
[02:00] Bitcoin is that we are early that it's
[02:03] so obvious and still nobody gets it.
[02:05] It's my favorite and my least favorite
[02:07] thing at the same time. The favorite
[02:09] thing it is because it gives us the
[02:13] opportunity to get in very very cheaply.
[02:15] Everything under a million is very very
[02:17] cheaply in my opinion. So we are far
[02:20] away from any uh price where I'm like oh
[02:23] like it's it's now not cheap anymore.
[02:25] And at the same
[02:27] time it's so obvious that it will
[02:30] actually happen. But this is also
[02:32] annoying sometimes because you get that
[02:36] uh future of Bitcoin. you get where it's
[02:38] going and it's so obvious to you and
[02:41] then you go out in the outside of
[02:43] Bitcoin world and you come to know that
[02:45] people are not where you are. They are
[02:48] at 2 3% of Bitcoin understanding and you
[02:52] might already be at 40 50% of Bitcoin
[02:54] understanding which is pretty pretty
[02:56] high. I think nobody gets above 60 70%
[02:59] of Bitcoin understanding. So like 40 50%
[03:02] is already really high. And this is just
[03:05] my uh my favorite thing uh to talk about
[03:09] in Bitcoin because it shows we are super
[03:11] early. It's it's still uh a very small
[03:15] asset and we might and that window of
[03:19] being early might be 2 years might be 20
[03:23] years we we we don't know but I think
[03:25] there is a tipping point coming and the
[03:28] tipping point is faster and faster
[03:31] approaching the more more speculative
[03:34] attacks on bitcoin are being made the
[03:36] first one with micro strategy then like
[03:38] 21 capital uh often the corporate side
[03:41] but Now even Trump is saying like we
[03:44] have to do it because otherwise China
[03:46] will do it. Uh he's pushing forward
[03:48] here. No clue what China and Russia is
[03:51] doing on on the back end not without
[03:53] telling people. Then you have
[03:55] individuals that are so many individuals
[03:58] that take out credit to buy Bitcoin. And
[04:00] the more and more people that do that,
[04:02] the tipping point where the US dollar is
[04:05] completely worthless and Bitcoin is the
[04:07] only asset that is everything is pricing
[04:10] at um that tipping point I think will
[04:13] come faster and faster. Maybe it's 2
[04:15] years, maybe it's 20 years, I don't
[04:17] know. Uh but it's it's fun to be an
[04:20] commentator and a host in in that space.
[04:24] Yeah, couldn't have said it better. I
[04:25] mean, I agree with you, right? It's such
[04:26] a strange phenomenon to be in Bitcoin
[04:29] and Bitcoin Twitter and all these
[04:30] things, all these people who believe in
[04:31] it and think it's the future and then
[04:32] like you said, you step one toe outside
[04:34] of that into sort of, you know, anything
[04:36] considered normal investing world,
[04:38] whether it be Reddit or Twitter or
[04:39] whatever, and they're immediately like,
[04:40] "That's a scam. You're an idiot." You're
[04:43] like, the the the pushand pull dichotomy
[04:45] between those two things is very
[04:46] strange. Do you have thoughts on like
[04:48] why why that is why it seems to be so
[04:51] sort of all or nothing? You know, people
[04:53] either kind of totally get it or think
[04:55] it's a total scam. There's two sides to
[04:57] it for when we look at history and
[05:00] innovation and and before already that
[05:03] kind of shifted everything like the
[05:06] printing press, electricity, the
[05:08] internet. This shifts the way how things
[05:12] are done. There was a point in time
[05:14] where 80% of the working force was
[05:18] farmers. When then the tractor comes
[05:20] along and makes things way more
[05:22] efficient. The people on the farm are
[05:25] like, "Oh what are we going to do?
[05:28] What what are we going to work in the
[05:29] future?" So with every invention, there
[05:33] is a big shift, a big change coming. And
[05:37] there are people that like change, that
[05:39] drive on change. Those are the
[05:41] innovators, the pioneers, the early
[05:42] adopters. That's basically us, the
[05:45] everyone that is watching and listening
[05:47] here because you are really early do
[05:49] that one. And uh then there are also the
[05:52] critical um people and with every new
[05:55] innovation, every new company with
[05:58] everything that is coming up new, this
[06:01] thing has to prove itself way more than
[06:04] the incumbent system. For example,
[06:07] Bitcoin has to always make everything
[06:11] perfect. It has to be also perfect on
[06:14] the let's say quantum computer computing
[06:17] resistance. Has anyone ever thought
[06:20] about if their bank account is quantum
[06:23] computer resistant? Like nobody
[06:26] questions that. But the same guy that
[06:28] has 100% in his bank account of his
[06:32] financial energy asked it. Oh, but when
[06:34] quantum computers come along, Bitcoin
[06:36] will be doomed. Yeah. Like you have 100%
[06:41] in a bank account that someone could
[06:44] easily hack. Easily hack. I come from IT
[06:47] security. Those banks are not safe at
[06:50] all. Uh
[06:52] so it it's it's always it's always the
[06:56] informed versus the uninformed. Those
[06:59] who are informed have a need to know.
[07:00] Those who are actually did the proof of
[07:03] work to dig into Bitcoin have an extreme
[07:07] advantage over those who don't do the
[07:10] hard work in digging into Bitcoin. I
[07:12] don't know about you, but it took me a
[07:13] long time to get over the thing that
[07:15] Bitcoin is not a scam. So when people
[07:19] then say on the one, oh we are super
[07:22] super bullish on Bitcoin and the other
[07:24] side, oh we are oh I hate Bitcoin. It
[07:27] consumes all the energy. it it will be
[07:29] deflationary. It will delete all. Yeah.
[07:33] I mean, of course, they they ride with
[07:34] the inflationary stuff, but uh those
[07:38] people just didn't do the work. Why a
[07:41] deflationary system is better. Why
[07:43] Bitcoin is so superior to a bank
[07:45] account, to a real estate, to whatever
[07:48] you want to compare it to as an asset,
[07:50] as a medium of exchange, and as as a
[07:52] unit of account. So the shift uh or the
[07:56] the the
[07:58] the imbalance between the ones that get
[08:02] it and the ones who don't get it is
[08:05] because it is changing so much in
[08:08] society. It will have such a huge impact
[08:11] on how we like bitcoin is money and
[08:15] money is literally in everything we do
[08:17] that that there isn't a day where I
[08:19] don't do anything with money. There's
[08:22] always either I buy a small thing, I
[08:25] earn something, I have some exchange, I
[08:27] go for dinner, what like it's really
[08:30] hard to have a day where there's no
[08:32] money involved in that day. So having to
[08:37] change that fundamentally will change
[08:40] things in your life. And this is scary
[08:42] for people and that's just a paradigm
[08:44] shift that we are living through. And
[08:46] it's normal that people uh tend to be
[08:49] extreme in those times. I I've I've not
[08:53] met a lot of people that say, "Yeah, I
[08:54] don't care about Bitcoin." Like they
[08:57] they either hate it or they love it. Uh
[08:59] but uh some are just didn't do a
[09:02] research. There are some honest people
[09:04] that say, "Oh, I don't want to infor I
[09:07] don't want to form an opinion on on
[09:10] something that I haven't uh dig into."
[09:12] and they're just neutral to it because
[09:14] they they didn't do any research on it.
[09:17] But those people are getting less and
[09:18] less and less because you have to do
[09:20] research like I either you're not
[09:23] researching and you just am on the I
[09:26] hate it and don't want to look into it
[09:28] or you are on the side where you
[09:31] research it because now it's not just a
[09:35] small play thing anymore. the biggest
[09:38] companies on the world uh the biggest
[09:40] country in the world they're all looking
[09:42] into it so you should also look into it.
[09:45] Yeah I mean I agree with that. I think
[09:47] uh the irony that Warren Buffett like he
[09:50] long ago he said like I don't understand
[09:51] technology so I don't invest in
[09:53] technology like I don't invest in Apple
[09:54] because I don't understand it which was
[09:56] like okay that's at least you can't
[09:58] fault him for putting it that way but
[10:00] ironically him and um what's his name
[10:03] Charlie Munger didn't do that with
[10:04] Bitcoin they didn't say oh I don't
[10:06] understand it they just said oh it's
[10:08] definitely a rat poison it's definitely
[10:09] a scam don't go near that and I'm like
[10:11] well you haven't even bothered to look
[10:13] into it for two seconds right you've
[10:16] said it a couple times that you think
[10:17] we're still really early. So like what
[10:19] do you say to people? I mean I think the
[10:20] entire history of Bitcoin people have
[10:22] thought they were late. We've seen
[10:23] people who like oh I only have 8,000
[10:25] 10,000 Bitcoin. I'm so late. It's
[10:27] already worth a dollar. I'm so late. You
[10:28] we see those tweets from decade ago.
[10:30] What do you think or what do you say to
[10:32] people when they're like oh it's 100k
[10:33] like I'm way too late. There is a time
[10:36] and place when you will be too late to
[10:39] Bitcoin and it's the time when you're
[10:41] not no longer able to buy Bitcoin with
[10:44] US dollar or fiat currencies. That's a
[10:47] time when you're definitely too late.
[10:49] Maybe a little bit beforehand also. But
[10:52] that time is far away far away far far
[10:56] away in terms of how much Bitcoin will
[10:59] run up in terms of how much time is
[11:03] left. I already teased it before with
[11:05] two years, 20 years. It's really hard to
[11:07] say. Uh it's it's it's about will that
[11:11] tipping point happen very gradually and
[11:14] slowly or will we just people lose trust
[11:17] in the system and and we go off in in a
[11:21] how Samar like the god candle. Uh it I
[11:25] don't know. Uh so so so there's two
[11:27] questions I still don't know in Bitcoin.
[11:30] Uh there's a lot of things that I know
[11:32] that we come to that system but it's a
[11:35] question of how fast we will get to
[11:38] Bitcoin standard and how exactly we will
[11:41] get there. Either it will be peacefully
[11:43] or it will be kind of an
[11:47] uh revolution rebellious times where
[11:50] there is an war in some form. It doesn't
[11:54] have to be a physical war, but it has to
[11:57] be some kind of of yeah war in in some
[12:00] sense. So those questions are harder to
[12:02] answer because there are so many
[12:04] variables at play. And anyone who claims
[12:07] to know exactly when Bitcoin will take
[12:10] off and and how Bitcoin will take off
[12:12] just doesn't know what he's talking
[12:13] about. Uh he probably wants to scam you.
[12:16] Uh
[12:18] but outside of those questions, it's
[12:21] more to know about where directionally
[12:24] are we going towards. And if you just
[12:28] give Bitcoin, let's say, a 5 to 10%
[12:30] chance that Bitcoin will actually be the
[12:33] next world reserve currency, the next
[12:35] Bitcoin standard, you have to look into
[12:39] this. You you cannot not look in it.
[12:42] It's so abundantly clear that the uh
[12:45] possibility of of Bitcoin becoming that
[12:48] is greater than zero. So you should do
[12:50] at least your homework to to get there.
[12:52] But but back to your question um when
[12:56] what are you saying like why why are you
[12:59] feeling late if if you have bought in
[13:02] because people always compare those
[13:04] prices that we are currently in. So
[13:06] they're looking, oh, I could have bought
[13:08] at 50,000, but now it's like 96,000 or
[13:11] something like that. So they feel late.
[13:15] It's the same thing as someone said,
[13:17] "Oh, I could have bought at
[13:19] $120, but now it's $300. Now I'm late to
[13:23] Bitcoin. I don't want We have all seen
[13:25] that tweet that saying like, "Oh, I only
[13:27] have $20,000 Bitcoin. uh and uh I've
[13:32] I've missed the boat on it. So I'm
[13:34] selling all my 20,000 Bitcoin and then 8
[13:38] years 10 years later they're like, "Oh
[13:39]  I cannot even afford one whole
[13:41] Bitcoin." And I had 20,000 at one
[13:45] point. So you come to the conclusion
[13:48] that yes, I need Bitcoin. Bitcoin might
[13:52] be the next standard. It might be the
[13:55] next world reserve currency. And when
[13:57] you come to that conclusion that Bitcoin
[13:59] is the next world reserve currency, you
[14:01] also kind of come to the conclusion
[14:03] of what else would I buy if not Bitcoin?
[14:08] And those Bitcoiner who who are really
[14:11] deep in Bitcoin can probably
[14:14] relate. What would I sell it for? you
[14:17] you you you come to a family dinner and
[14:20] someone says like, "Oh, it would
[14:22] wouldn't it be good if you kind of
[14:23] diversify into real estate a little bit
[14:25] to buy yourself a home for your family?"
[14:28] I'm like, "It's not a bad idea, but I'm
[14:31] not risking selling one bitcoin now to
[14:35] get a down payment for a home that I
[14:38] want. I mean, now you probably can get a
[14:41] down payment for like 0.5 Bitcoin." Um,
[14:45] so and and then losing out on one
[14:48] bitcoin being like a hundred million
[14:50] dollars. Why would I do that? I can buy
[14:53] a city with one bitcoin at some point.
[14:56] So So why would I pay now the town
[15:00] payment on one singular house? I rather
[15:03] rent a few more years. Like that that
[15:05] does not make sense for me. If you want
[15:07] it emotionally, that's fine. Like if if
[15:10] if you have a Bitcoin stack and
[15:12] emotionally you have to buy a house,
[15:14] then go ahead and do it. Just know it's
[15:16] a bad financial decision. Don't don't
[15:19] don't argue with like, oh, it's
[15:20] diversification or it's a good financial
[15:22] decision. No, like selling Bitcoin and
[15:25] buying real estate is a bad decision.
[15:27] Selling Bitcoin to buy anything except
[15:30] Bitcoin is probably a bad decision
[15:32] financially. So um I I came to the
[15:37] conclusion that we are super early. Most
[15:40] people don't get it. Most people still
[15:43] don't have a need to know about Bitcoin.
[15:45] And uh most people will know it once the
[15:51] tipping point is reached right around
[15:53] the tipping point. one year before it
[15:55] till one year after that tipping point.
[15:57] That's where like 80% of people will
[15:59] come. Even if you're at like and then I
[16:02] talked about that at length at other
[16:04] podcasts. Even if we at 90% Bitcoin at
[16:08] no even if we are at $1 million Bitcoin,
[16:13] 90 to 95% of the population will still
[16:16] don't know what Bitcoin is. They they
[16:18] might have it in some exposure. They
[16:21] might have some Bitcoin ETF as a
[16:23] diversifier, 5% in their
[16:26] portfolio, but the most of the price
[16:29] action comes first from the retail
[16:31] crowd. And even if it reaches high,
[16:35] there's only a small group of people
[16:37] that actually understand Bitcoin and
[16:39] actually does the work. I I don't think
[16:40] we will ever get to a point where the
[16:44] sound economics, why Bitcoin works will
[16:47] get mainstream. Bitcoin will get
[16:49] mainstream. But nobody will know how it
[16:51] works. Like nobody will care about UTXO
[16:54] management. We care about UTXO
[16:56] management right now. And I I can
[16:58] guarantee you there's like 50% of the uh
[17:01] audience right now that asking like what
[17:03] is UTXO management? You would be
[17:06] astonished how less people that watch
[17:10] Bitcoin podcasts sometimes know about
[17:12] Bitcoin. I I I watched Bitcoin podcasts
[17:16] for two three years and I still didn't
[17:19] know about you. management. I learned it
[17:21] very late. So even within the Bitcoin
[17:23] crowd, there are a lot of things that
[17:26] people don't know about Bitcoin and I
[17:29] have so many I have so many gaps in my
[17:31] knowledge on Bitcoin. I'm still uh I
[17:34] have interviewed now almost 500
[17:37] different guests and I learn every day
[17:39] something new about Bitcoin. It's crazy
[17:42] for me how deep that rabbit hole is. So
[17:45] the the point I kind of wanted to make
[17:47] is we early and not a lot of people get
[17:50] it and this information asymmetry is
[17:55] huge so huge uh that you kind of
[18:00] wonder why am I seeing that and and
[18:03] other people don't like who who am I
[18:06] like why why was I so lucky to stumble
[18:10] upon Bitcoin right now that that's I
[18:13] forgot your initial question, but that
[18:15] dismal. No, no, you nailed it. Yeah, you
[18:17] nailed it. No, I mean I feel the same
[18:18] way sometimes like Yeah. when you step
[18:20] outside the bubble and you see everybody
[18:21] hating on it or dismissing it and you
[18:23] think, "Wait, this is so strange. Am I
[18:25] wrong?" And then try to steal man the
[18:27] arguments and then you're like always
[18:28] come back to like, "No, I think they
[18:30] just, like you said, haven't they
[18:31] haven't thought about it. They haven't
[18:32] they haven't done the work." Or like you
[18:34] talked about the farmer in the tractor,
[18:36] right? And I've seen this one on on
[18:38] Twitter where it's uh like Fifth Avenue
[18:40] in New York in like 1903 and it's like
[18:43] all all horses, you know, horserawn
[18:45] carriages and then a decade later and
[18:47] it's all same picture, same spot and
[18:49] it's all cars, one horse and you're like
[18:52] so you talked about well the only thing
[18:53] we don't know is how fast it'll happen,
[18:55] right? And but I think you kind of made
[18:57] this point too which is super
[18:58] interesting is that it seems like it's
[19:00] going really slow and most people don't
[19:02] get it. But when a new technology that
[19:04] is that much better comes along, it can
[19:07] happen all at once. It it's that tipping
[19:09] point question um where once we reach
[19:13] that tipping point, it could go really
[19:15] really fast, especially with money
[19:18] because if people lose trust in their
[19:21] money and this spreads like wildfire
[19:23] like, "Oh, did you hear hyperinflation?
[19:25] US dollar, you still have€ 10,000 euros
[19:28] in the bank account. Get rid of it. Buy
[19:29] some Bitcoin. That that could that that
[19:32] is wildfire. Once trust like right now
[19:35] the euro, the US dollar, the yen, all of
[19:39] those uh currencies still work because
[19:42] majority of people still trust them.
[19:44] That that's the only reason they can
[19:46] print so much money because people trust
[19:48] in those systems and in those fiat
[19:50] currencies. If that trust is gone and
[19:53] they're trying to uh print the last
[19:57] currencies out to get a little bit
[19:59] purchasing power for the governments,
[20:01] they will completely erode the US
[20:03] dollar. It can completely erode the the
[20:05] the feared currencies and it can go very
[20:08] very quickly. That's my theory that it
[20:10] will go very quickly as we seen with the
[20:13] car. It's an amazing picture seen first
[20:15] all the horses and then one car and then
[20:18] only uh cars with like one two horses
[20:21] and the horse might always be around. I
[20:25] I live in Vienna in in the middle of
[20:27] Vienna there are horse carriages on a
[20:29] Sunday afternoon where the uh tourists
[20:32] come and drive with the horse carriage
[20:34] through the city but it's like 0.01%
[20:38] 01% of the uh industry that is driving
[20:42] around in Vienna through the museums and
[20:45] stuff like that and the palaces in a
[20:48] horse carriage. It's it's a fun thing to
[20:50] do. In the same way, maybe feared is
[20:55] always existing in form of a government
[20:57] token that you use to buy your tax uh to
[21:02] pay your taxes or to uh get social
[21:06] insurance if you are uh if if you're out
[21:09] of job, you may maybe get a government
[21:11] token and as soon as you get it, you
[21:13] quickly convert it to Bitcoin. like the
[21:16] there there might still be feared
[21:18] around. When I'm saying fear is gone,
[21:22] I'm
[21:23] saying
[21:25] 99% of people, businesses and countries
[21:28] and everything like that and individuals
[21:31] will operate on a Bitcoin standard,
[21:33] meaning 80% plus will be in Bitcoin safe
[21:38] and not into fiat currencies and also
[21:41] not into the stock market. Like the
[21:43] stock market is something for investors.
[21:46] People forgot that that we have a stock
[21:49] market that is used for saving but it's
[21:52] called investing not saving. Bitcoin is
[21:54] saving. This is where 80% of your money
[21:57] should be. Then you should have 20%
[22:01] where you maybe
[22:02] speculate but most people will have 100%
[22:05] in Bitcoin. Some people will have only
[22:08] 50% in Bitcoin and speculate with more
[22:10] because they are angel investors. They
[22:12] they seek risk. That's a profession.
[22:15] Like being an investor takes time. You
[22:18] have to understand the business. You
[22:19] have to understand the ins and outs. So
[22:22] this will only be a very small
[22:24] percentage. Most people will be better
[22:27] off just doing Bitcoin. It's already
[22:30] happening right now and it will be
[22:32] happening in the in the future too. You
[22:34] talked about the trust piece, right?
[22:36] like and when that starts to break down
[22:38] I'm very f I don't necessarily like you
[22:40] said think you know government fiat or
[22:41] dollar is going to go away overnight but
[22:44] there is we are seems to me like in an
[22:46] interesting moment right now where there
[22:47] is some degree of trust of the US dollar
[22:50] breaking down like it still fascinates
[22:51] me that with zero interest rate policy
[22:54] since 2008 this basically people still
[22:57] consider US Treasury bonds
[22:59] risk-free it's like they don't pay
[23:02] interest and uh there's nothing but
[23:03] inflation and they're still risk- free
[23:05] and that fascinates me but we do still
[23:07] seems like we're at a place where
[23:09] internationally there's some trust in
[23:11] the US dollar as the global reserve
[23:13] currency the treasury as the global
[23:15] reserve asset sort of breaking down. Do
[23:17] you feel like that is true right now or
[23:20] are we are we just too deep in the weeds
[23:22] or do you think that that has a a
[23:23] lasting effect going forward? I I just
[23:25] want to throw a story in there. I was
[23:27] actually last week on on holidays in in
[23:29] in Albania and uh Austria has the euro,
[23:34] Albania has the le I don't know if
[23:37] there's an English word for that. Uh but
[23:39] it's basically one to 100. So like one
[23:42] euro is like a 100 le there. So you deal
[23:45] with those bills that have like a,000
[23:49] written on them and it's actually not
[23:52] a,000, it's like€ 10.
[23:54] And it kind of made me aware of if you
[23:58] come from a country where you always
[24:01] dealt with the euro. So I'm born
[24:04] 1998. Uh the the euro was introduced in
[24:07] Austria I think 2001. So since I'm 3
[24:09] years old since I'm I can think I always
[24:12] dealt with the euro as my main unit of
[24:14] account. So that's how how my real money
[24:18] kind of looks. But once you get out of
[24:20] the system and go to another place, be
[24:24] it the US dollar, being it the Albanian
[24:28] LE, being it the Turkish Lero, being
[24:30] whatever currency it is, you almost have
[24:33] this intuition of like that's play money
[24:36] like like I got a 100 I have a 10,000 or
[24:40] 50,000 leer in my hands right now. Like
[24:43] what is that someone wrote 50,000 on
[24:45] there? Like why does this has value? Why
[24:48] do people accept that? And it's all
[24:51] about the trust. Uh so I'm not a macro
[24:54] guy. Uh and uh I I'm I'm not uh I I
[24:58] think every fiat currency probably will
[25:02] go to So um this is the the
[25:06] long-term thing. But if I had to guess,
[25:09] if I pull all my uh knowledge from the
[25:12] 500 Bitcoiners that I've interviewed and
[25:14] asked those those questions a lot also,
[25:17] um I think the US dollar will be the
[25:20] last currency standing. I think we will
[25:22] use the US dollar in Europe, in Russia
[25:25] and and maybe in other places. Um there
[25:28] there might be a second one. Maybe
[25:30] there's a third one. Maybe Russia uses
[25:33] something else. Maybe BRICS is is coming
[25:35] up with something. Maybe China uses
[25:37] their own currency, but there's not
[25:39] place for 150 currencies. Like 150 is
[25:43] especially when we have uh stable coins
[25:46] and and blockchain technology. I I'm
[25:48] like I just have to make sure I'm
[25:51] bitcoin only. Like I hate cryptos. I
[25:53] hate stable coins. But they
[25:57] definitely globalize fiat currencies
[26:00] more easily. So with stable coins, all
[26:02] of the sudden the US dollar is available
[26:05] everywhere and you can pay and and and
[26:07] and earn in in stable coins. Um so we
[26:11] will have a future where there there
[26:13] might be just two or three around. Think
[26:15] about that like think about and and I
[26:18] don't know where I heard I think it was
[26:19] some some Twitter story. Think about
[26:22] there are aliens coming to to Earth and
[26:25] they're asking oh like how do you how do
[26:27] you communicate value? I'm like, "Yeah,
[26:30] we we we use currency for it." And
[26:32] they're like, "Okay, what what is
[26:33] currency?" And you're like, "Yeah, it's
[26:35] it's it's basically money. So, we using
[26:37] it to buy and earn stuff." Oh, okay. And
[26:40] and and how's it called? Yeah, it's it
[26:42] depends where you are. Oh, like you How
[26:46] many are there? Two, three. No, we have
[26:47] like 155 different currencies. And And
[26:51] there's like a market where you can
[26:52] trade in it. and and there's like a
[26:54] whole a whole whole industry just around
[26:57] uh h how those how those currencies
[27:01] interact with each other. For an alien,
[27:03] it would look so stupid and so
[27:06] inefficient that we are not that many
[27:10] humans. We're like 8 billion people.
[27:12] Like we're not that big and that that
[27:14] that important that we need 155
[27:17] different currencies. That that's a
[27:19] weird period of time that we're living
[27:20] in. Um, so it it it obviously will
[27:27] consolidate if it all goes to the US
[27:30] dollar or it all goes to like maybe
[27:33] three, four different currencies. It's
[27:35] hard to say.
[27:38] Maybe we live in a in a medium time
[27:40] where there's like two three main
[27:42] currencies that are used before we come
[27:45] to the actual Bitcoin standard where
[27:47] then Bitcoin is is kind of the the the
[27:49] main currency and asset and then each
[27:53] country has their own small little
[27:55] tokens that that they also use to
[27:57] interact with the current with their
[27:59] governments and stuff like that. This
[28:00] this could could happen. Uh but I'm as I
[28:03] said like I I don't want to claim to to
[28:05] have all my knowledge with
[28:07] macroeconomics. Uh I I just know it it
[28:10] will be very obvious why we have
[28:14] to bet on Bitcoin and not on any any any
[28:18] anything else. Yeah. I mean I love your
[28:21] story about the euro, right? I think
[28:22] like that is so fascinating that like
[28:24] most people especially in the US
[28:26] probably don't even realize like you
[28:28] said well the euro only started being
[28:30] used used in Austria in 2001 I think
[28:32] since like 24 years that the euro the
[28:34] euro has been the unit of account and
[28:36] the main currency in Austria maybe in
[28:38] other parts of Europe a little before
[28:39] that but like the hero is like 25 years
[28:41] old so so much of criticism that I see
[28:44] about Bitcoin is people just saying like
[28:46] oh well it'll never compete with the
[28:48] dollar or like Bitcoin is not a unit of
[28:50] account the dollar is a unit of account
[28:52] They just don't understand how these
[28:54] things work. And the fact that the the
[28:56] euro didn't exist and then all of a
[28:58] sudden one day it did exist. That
[28:59] doesn't mean the euro always will exist
[29:01] or always will be the unit of account.
[29:03] It's like shows you that it can change.
[29:05] And like you said, I think it's
[29:06] fascinating that if you think of the
[29:08] internet as this thing that's sort of
[29:09] breaking down borders globally, right?
[29:11] It's commerce across borders. Like the
[29:14] imaginary lines on the map don't matter
[29:16] nearly as much in the age of the
[29:17] internet. Why won't that also be true of
[29:20] money? like you said, like how long can
[29:23] these countries keep their little fake
[29:25] monopoly monies alive within these
[29:27] imaginary lines on the map when you have
[29:29] a global world that's becoming more
[29:31] borderless and now a money that's
[29:33] completely borderless that none of them
[29:34] can control? I have uh my my small
[29:38] little podcast production team and we
[29:41] are on three different
[29:45] continents and and it it works
[29:47] seamlessly. you can work together and we
[29:50] even uh pay each other not all of them
[29:53] but uh some of them in bitcoin. So you
[29:56] have a communication layer of of the
[29:58] internet where you can zoom to each
[30:00] other. You have a payment layer with
[30:02] Bitcoin where you can transact value to
[30:05] each other. Uh and and and you just have
[30:08] all those those communication and and
[30:10] value layers to each other. And then
[30:13] it's the
[30:14] question how why why do we need those
[30:17] borders? Yeah, maybe it's it's it's good
[30:20] to have physical protection borders and
[30:23] people can choose where to to live, but
[30:25] what's the real role of government once
[30:28] Bitcoin is a
[30:30] standard? Are they going to be a service
[30:33] center for maintaining roads,
[30:35] maintaining hospitals and maintaining a
[30:37] safety net for for less fortunate
[30:40] people? I think that's where we where we
[30:43] might go where we all pay a small tax to
[30:47] contribute to roads to contribute to a
[30:49] safety net for less fortunate people. Um
[30:53] so I'm not completely anarch capitalist
[30:55] where I'm like uh government completely
[30:58] will go away. I think there is some need
[31:01] uh for some central um entity that that
[31:05] provides for people as a service center
[31:08] that could also be a private institution
[31:11] and then it's like okay what's what's
[31:13] the difference between private and
[31:16] public if there is
[31:19] no no buying power from the government
[31:22] like they cannot print money at that
[31:24] point they are also private like what
[31:26] what differentiated like publicly
[31:29] a public institution from a private
[31:32] institution because they're going to
[31:34] print money. Maybe there's uh some sort
[31:37] of membership. So I I think we will see
[31:41] the sovereign individual basically
[31:42] playing out. I mean most Bitcoiners have
[31:45] read that or are aware of that theory of
[31:47] the sovereign individual and and that's
[31:50] what we already see playing out but it
[31:53] will take some time. It's it's it's not
[31:55] overnight. The internet is also not
[31:57] finished. Uh people are like I like the
[31:58] internet. But we will we need to build a
[32:01] lot more um to to make alo the internet
[32:04] maybe more decentralized more robust we
[32:07] more private in in some regards. We we
[32:10] need to build out the payment layer for
[32:12] the internet which is Bitcoin which is
[32:14] lightning which is fedment which is all
[32:16] the great things that happen on on layer
[32:18] two of Bitcoin and maybe layer three
[32:19] also. So we have a long ways to go but
[32:23] it's so exciting to live in that world
[32:26] and then there's coming AI and robotics
[32:28] into the place where I'm like okay how
[32:30] will this impact the working place how
[32:33] much work do we need to actually do in
[32:35] the future let's come back to the
[32:37] tractor example and the
[32:39] farmers now I see AI actually making
[32:42] really good work I can have less
[32:45] employees because the employees have AI
[32:49] and AI makes each employee more
[32:51] efficient. So why do I need three
[32:55] people? Maybe one that is highly skilled
[32:58] with AI can do the same job of
[33:01] previously three people. And maybe AI
[33:04] gets so good that I only even need that
[33:05] one person. I just have an AI agent out
[33:08] there. Let's make an example. I have a
[33:12] clips channel. The Eclipse channel is uh
[33:16] just recently started and I didn't have
[33:19] the time to do it myself. So I hired
[33:21] someone and uh he do is doing a great
[33:24] job and I just basically said to him,
[33:27] "Oh, I would like it for that it looks
[33:30] like that a little bit and you should um
[33:33] do this and that." That's why I had kind
[33:35] of some inputs that I gave him for the
[33:37] clip channel and then he just went on
[33:40] and and did his thing and he's doing an
[33:41] amazing
[33:42] job. I can also tell an AI agent the
[33:47] inputs and the AI agent also pulls
[33:50] resources of the internet and can figure
[33:53] out what's to do what what's the best
[33:55] job. It's not quite there yet and it's
[33:58] also
[33:59] expensive. So, we're not quite there yet
[34:02] in that future, but we will get there.
[34:06] And once we get there and we don't have
[34:08] to work anymore because AI is is taking
[34:10] up the work, what are humans left to do?
[34:13] What is what is the value mean in in in
[34:16] that world? And I think in that world,
[34:19] it will increasingly get more important
[34:22] to have something that AI also wants,
[34:25] which is Bitcoin.
[34:27] What what currency will EI choose? What
[34:30] what currency will what asset will EI
[34:34] because that EI agent has to be paid
[34:37] because he needs to run his electricity
[34:40] and his internet bill. So he needs to
[34:42] get money for the tasks he's doing. So
[34:45] we have to pay him and we will pay him
[34:47] in Bitcoin. If you already ask um AI
[34:51] what's the perfect money, he will
[34:53] basically describe you now what Bitcoin
[34:57] is, AI will figure out that it will need
[35:01] Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, unit of
[35:03] account and store of value. So AI will
[35:06] demand Bitcoin, people will demand
[35:08] Bitcoin. It will be a huge and that's
[35:11] why I'm also saying nobody is bullish
[35:14] enough because people
[35:16] cannot people cannot grasp how big the
[35:19] opportunity of bit Bitcoin actually is
[35:21] because not just 8 billion people that
[35:24] will compete for the 21 million bitcoin.
[35:28] It's also
[35:30] the 185 nation states that will compete
[35:34] for each bitcoin. But it also is the I
[35:37] don't know how many companies there are.
[35:39] Actually, I've never looked it up how
[35:40] many companies there are on the world,
[35:42] but I guess a few hundred thousand
[35:44] companies there will be maybe in the
[35:47] millions. That's actually interesting. I
[35:49] have to look that up later how many
[35:50] companies there are in the world. They
[35:52] will uh all want Bitcoin. And then we'll
[35:55] also have EI agents like billions of AI
[35:59] agents that all do a small little task
[36:02] that also want to get paid in Bitcoin.
[36:04] So this and and then we may come to a
[36:06] point where we find other
[36:08] planets and they also want Bitcoin. So
[36:12] this this thinking of like oh once we at
[36:15] like 10 million Bitcoin is kind of at a
[36:18] peak. No, we are not. Humanity is not a
[36:21] at a peak and Bitcoin will also not be
[36:23] at a peak because we will always get
[36:25] more efficient. We will also always get
[36:27] bigger. We always get uh more creative
[36:30] in doing things. So, Bitcoin will always
[36:33] grow with
[36:34] us. Yeah, maybe if Bitcoin is 90% 95%
[36:39] adopted and we are at like 150 million
[36:43] uh I mean at that point nobody will
[36:45] compare Bitcoin to US dollar anymore.
[36:47] But let's say it would have the
[36:49] purchasing power of like 150 million. At
[36:52] that
[36:53] point um we will have such a huge value
[36:58] uh in Bitcoin that it might make sense
[37:00] to not diversify but find a faster
[37:04] horse. Maybe there's a new technology
[37:06] coming along that I want to invest in.
[37:10] So that might be a thing that I'm also
[37:13] looking at. Hey, when Bitcoin is
[37:15] completely boring and everyone gets it,
[37:18] maybe on my podcast I'm talking about
[37:20] something else and I'm investing also
[37:22] like 20% of my Bitcoin in something else
[37:24] because it's more exciting. But it's not
[37:27] in competition with the best store of
[37:30] value, best medium of exchange and best
[37:32] unit of account, which is Bitcoin. It is
[37:35] just in competition with the people that
[37:38] seek out more that seek out the yield on
[37:41] top of Bitcoin that seek out oh how do I
[37:44] get with investing more Bitcoin. Every
[37:46] investment the hurdle rate of Bitcoin
[37:49] that the hurdle rate of investment will
[37:51] change to whatever Bitcoin grows at. So
[37:55] you will ask yourself the question, do I
[37:57] really want to put money there if it
[38:00] doesn't outperform Bitcoin? If I have
[38:02] less Bitcoin than before, why should I
[38:05] invest in this? If I have more Bitcoin
[38:08] than before, then I invest in this. And
[38:10] how how likely is it to succeed? Every
[38:13] investment will be fueled through the
[38:16] hurdle rate of of Bitcoin. So, yeah,
[38:20] it's it's just tremendous. Well, and the
[38:22] thing you were talking about about AI
[38:23] and robotics is something I'm totally
[38:25] fascinated by and lately I've been like
[38:27] digging into this more and more. a like
[38:29] you said of what currency will AI want
[38:32] to use which like speaking of the
[38:33] borderless thing like you think an AI
[38:35] agent wants to get paid in like you said
[38:38] like the Turkish LRA and then have to in
[38:40] the background figure out how to swap it
[38:41] for US dollar like that's silly like of
[38:43] course AI wants to be paid in a global
[38:46] neutral borderless permissionless world
[38:49] reserve currency that is a native value
[38:52] transfer protocol to the internet itself
[38:54] right not a thing that it it's like oh
[38:56] it has to deal with banks and just kind
[38:58] of a silly idea. But even beyond what
[39:00] what will AI want to be paid in? This
[39:03] idea that you talked about of what
[39:05] happens when AI and robotics can do most
[39:07] of the labor that humans do.
[39:10] Now, I think this is sort of a Jeff
[39:12] Booth idea where I first heard it. I've
[39:14] heard it in other places, too. And it's
[39:15] kind of a hard concept to really wrap
[39:17] your mind around, but in my opinion,
[39:19] it's or in my understanding, it's sort
[39:20] of like if AI and robotics can do most
[39:23] of the labor that humans do now, human
[39:25] labor becomes essentially economically
[39:27] un unprofitable. So, we all basically
[39:30] lose our jobs. Well, what does the
[39:32] government probably do? They step in and
[39:34] print money to help everyone. But by
[39:38] printing money, they devalue everything
[39:40] you have that's fiat savings or fiat
[39:42] earnings or denominated in fiat.
[39:44] Therefore, the Bitcoin is the only thing
[39:48] that's going to save you from that world
[39:50] or maintain its purchasing power value,
[39:53] real value in that world. Let's take a
[39:56] break for a moment and appreciate the
[39:58] beauty that coin vigilante has made with
[40:01] the Bitcoin watches. Those watches are
[40:04] the most amazing, the most elegant way
[40:07] of showing that you are a true
[40:09] Bitcoiner. and Coin Vigilante just
[40:12] dropped a completely new and amazing
[40:14] Genesis edition of their watch
[40:17] collections. You have the date of the
[40:20] first ever minded Bitcoin block in there
[40:23] and of course also the block height and
[40:25] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[40:29] the level of detail they put in in this
[40:32] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[40:34] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[40:37] down in the descriptions. I love those
[40:39] watches. so so much. And now if you have
[40:42] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[40:45] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[40:47] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[40:49] to deal with that. The first way is you
[40:52] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[40:54] entry for you to get into the
[40:56] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[41:00] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[41:02] super simple and secure way. And if you
[41:05] check out the link in the description,
[41:07] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[41:10] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[41:13] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[41:16] partner in terms of how to get the most
[41:19] out of your sovereignty. They will
[41:22] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[41:25] that is perfect for your individual
[41:28] situation. They will show you how you
[41:30] can secure your own devices. Securing
[41:33] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[41:35] have to keep all your devices secure.
[41:37] One topic that is overlooked often is
[41:39] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[41:42] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[41:45] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[41:48] place already? And last but not least,
[41:50] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[41:52] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[41:54] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[41:59] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30 minute
[42:02] free call. And just a quick side note, I
[42:05] will be for the first time ever speaking
[42:07] at the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[42:10] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[42:13] really looking forward to seeing all of
[42:15] you there. You can get your ticket in
[42:17] the link down in the description of
[42:19] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[42:22] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[42:25] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[42:27] there. Bitcoin will be the only thing
[42:29] that is actually connected to a proof of
[42:31] work system. If you think about if you
[42:34] think about it from first principles, if
[42:37] you want to save something uh for the
[42:40] future, for 100 years, 200 years, 2,000
[42:42] years in the future for the next
[42:44] generations, you want something that
[42:47] nobody can control, nobody can print
[42:50] more of and is actually connected to
[42:54] something in the real world to energy.
[42:57] That's why we have the proof of working
[42:58] mechanism to protect the network. That's
[43:01] why we have the full node operators to
[43:03] protect the network. So there there's
[43:07] basically two things going on. The first
[43:08] thing in in in Bitcoin is that it is
[43:13] transferring value over time. So you
[43:17] will have uh you you will be able to get
[43:20] your financial energy across multiple
[43:24] decades, maybe hundreds of years and and
[43:26] future generations. This impacts how we
[43:29] think about it today because it's not
[43:32] only that yeah like because people
[43:34] understanding yeah but I will be dead in
[43:37] 50 years first of all you don't know
[43:40] that medical things also uh evolve maybe
[43:43] your head is going to go will get
[43:46] screwed on a robot you like you have no
[43:48] clue what the future brings like how do
[43:50] you know that you're dead in 50 years I
[43:52] don't know if I'm dead in 50 years uh I
[43:55] mean I I would still be considered
[43:57] normal human age in 50 years because I'm
[44:00] young but uh like even in in 500 years I
[44:03] might still alive. Uh so so that's the
[44:07] first thing you you want to have you you
[44:09] want to grab something that potentially
[44:12] is there for 2,000 years because it will
[44:14] be also better in 10 years if it will
[44:17] last 2,000 years because more people
[44:18] will decide for that. Then you want also
[44:21] to have something that can float around
[44:23] freely through space. That's the second
[44:25] thing, time and space that we always
[44:27] talking about. You don't want
[44:30] something try to carry a gold bar
[44:34] through an
[44:36] airport and not declare it. They will
[44:40] arrest you right there. Like like they
[44:42] will get your gold. They they they will
[44:45] take your gold. They will assume that
[44:47] you're a criminal and they will ask you
[44:50] all kinds of questions. And yes, you
[44:52] will spend it maybe even a day in
[44:54] prison. I don't know.
[44:56] Um get go with uh 20,000 let's say
[45:02] $200,000 in cash over the borders and
[45:05] not declare it like you you will get in
[45:08] troubles. You you cannot carry that much
[45:10] uh cash with
[45:11] you. If you go with $2 billion in
[45:16] Bitcoin over the borders, nobody even
[45:19] knows you. You can you can save it in
[45:21] your head like you can save it in your
[45:23] brain. I mean it's a very risky thing to
[45:26] do saving$2 billion dollars in your head
[45:28] but you can do it.
[45:30] So the only thing than transport through
[45:34] space and
[45:36] time
[45:37] efficiently is Bitcoin. And then the
[45:40] question is like what are you going to
[45:42] do? Are you embracing it or are you
[45:44] hating on it? Because hating on it is
[45:47] unproductive. It's something that will
[45:50] not yield you, your family, or anyone
[45:52] any results. In fact, it will accelerate
[45:56] Bitcoin adoption. If you're hating on
[45:58] Bitcoin and you are actively telling
[46:00] people about Bitcoin, people will wonder
[46:02] why you hate on Bitcoin so much and all
[46:05] of the sudden they're researching
[46:06] Bitcoin. I I got orange built. One of
[46:10] the people at Orange Build me is Peter
[46:12] Schiff. Like he he talks a lot about
[46:15] Bitcoin. uh he he's orange built
[46:18] probably like 200 times more people than
[46:21] I did with uh a pure Bitcoin only focus
[46:25] just because he has such a big reach and
[46:26] he's using his reach to orange pill
[46:29] people. I don't know if he wants that
[46:32] but uh he definitely does. I had um
[46:36] university professor that has a lecture
[46:40] on IT security and he always starts his
[46:43] lecture with lecturing people about how
[46:46] bad Bitcoin is. He doesn't need to
[46:49] mention Bitcoin at all. But there's a
[46:53] audience sitting of 2,000 people that
[46:55] now is
[46:57] asking why is he talking about Bitcoin
[46:59] now? Like am I not in IoT security? like
[47:04] I I want to learn about IT security and
[47:06] not not not about Bitcoin, but I guess
[47:08] I'll Google it what Bitcoin is. I guess
[47:11] I'll look it up. And from those 2,000
[47:13] people, uh a thousand people don't
[47:16] listen to him anyways. They're just
[47:17] staring on the screen and and trying to
[47:20] get through it. Then there's 500 people.
[47:22] They're like, "Ah, of course, Bitcoin,
[47:24] it's bad thing. I heard it also in the
[47:26] news. I also heard it in mainstream
[47:27] media." But there's like at least 20 to
[47:30] 50 people and say like, "Oh, okay." Like
[47:33] what what is actually Bitcoin? Like I
[47:35] never heard about that. They're
[47:36] researching. They're going down the
[47:38] rabbit hole. And those from those 20
[47:41] people, maybe two are like, "Hey, I
[47:43] really like Bitcoin." And uh all of the
[47:46] sudden this one hater produced like 50
[47:49] Bitcoiners. It hating on Bitcoin is
[47:53] actually is actually improving the
[47:56] system. It not does not only sharpen the
[47:59] knives of all the Bitcoiners out there
[48:01] because we get bad arguments. We can see
[48:04] how we can tackle those bad arguments,
[48:06] but it also produces real Bitcoiners
[48:09] that out there and then are actually
[48:11] accelerating the the mission. It's the
[48:14] same thing. There was a very famous song
[48:17] in uh
[48:19] Germany two years ago that got banned.
[48:24] Leila, I don't know if you know about
[48:26] that song. And because of the content of
[48:29] the song, it's about prostitutes,
[48:31] whatever. Uh, the song got banned. Uh, I
[48:35] think it I don't even know it was in it
[48:36] was somewhere in Europe, it got banned
[48:39] because it got banned. It was the
[48:43] most It was the most famous song in this
[48:46] year. And I I went to I was living in
[48:49] Munich at that time. And I went to the
[48:52] October Fest. Uh probably most people
[48:54] are aware October Fest is a huge thing
[48:55] where people drink a lot of beer and
[48:59] this song was in every tent every hour.
[49:05] I I hated that song so much just because
[49:08] you heard it everywhere and it was a bad
[49:10] song. like it was not something it was
[49:13] not a fun like I didn't like the song
[49:16] but I kind of like the message of it
[49:19] because it was banned now everyone was
[49:21] playing that song it's the same thing
[49:23] when I say do not think about a blue
[49:26] elephant right now do not think like you
[49:29] will think about a blue ele like how
[49:30] does a blue elephant actually look are
[49:32] all elephants blue no they're actually
[49:34] gray they are not blue like the haters
[49:37] are just accelerating the actual Bitcoin
[49:39] adoption with giving Bitcoin more
[49:42] airtime. And at that point, if I would
[49:46] sit now in this
[49:47] university seminar and there's like
[49:50] 2,000 people and someone is talking
[49:52] trash about Bitcoin, I would love that
[49:55] because he doesn't need to to speak
[49:57] about Bitcoin. He's advertising it and
[50:00] he doesn't even like it. There are
[50:03] orange pillars that are advertisers for
[50:06] Bitcoin that hate the asset. How amazing
[50:08] is that? people that like it and people
[50:11] that hate it are all advertising for
[50:13] Bitcoin. It's the whole game theory
[50:14] aspect and we talked about before that
[50:16] there's no one in the middle. There's
[50:18] people that really like it, they
[50:20] advertise it. They go around like
[50:22] maniacs to the family members like hey
[50:24] you have to buy it like myself and there
[50:27] are other people that hate it and they
[50:29] say to everyone like do not buy it. But
[50:32] the human brain doesn't understand
[50:34] don't. It's actually really funny. uh we
[50:36] we con we we do not process the don't we
[50:41] only hear what we hear uh the human
[50:43] brain if you like don't press that
[50:45] button we only hear press that button so
[50:48] if someone says like do not buy bitcoin
[50:50] the the the only thing that the human
[50:53] brain really remembers is buy bitcoin so
[50:56] if just just a small brain trick if you
[51:00] want to remember something don't say
[51:04] don't forget
[51:05] get to pack the passport.
[51:09] Say you have to remember getting the
[51:12] passport. It's easier for the brain to
[51:14] understand. Sorry, a small detour.
[51:19] But but the the important thing is that
[51:23] there
[51:24] are on the left side, on the right side
[51:27] or like whatever like pro Bitcoin and
[51:28] and against Bitcoin both are advertising
[51:31] Bitcoin. And this makes the whole thing
[51:35] more more airtime. So, it's a no-brainer
[51:37] for me. It's sort of the everything is
[51:39] good for Bitcoin kind of meme, right?
[51:41] Meets the all publicity is good
[51:44] publicity sort of saying, right? And
[51:46] it's like I kind of think that's a great
[51:48] way to put it. I've never really heard
[51:49] it put that way, but that's really funny
[51:50] how even people are hating on it are
[51:53] trying to, you know, go in front of
[51:55] 2,000 students for no good reason
[51:56] talking crap about Bitcoin. I think and
[51:59] I think the re as you're saying that I'm
[52:01] thinking well ultimately the reason for
[52:03] that is that Bitcoin is truth and if the
[52:05] truth is sitting there no matter how
[52:08] many people are sort of saying oh that's
[52:09] not true that's not true more and more
[52:11] people are going to look at it and go
[52:12] well are they right is that true is that
[52:14] not true and more and more people look
[52:15] into it and what from what I've seen the
[52:18] vast majority of people who actually
[52:19] take the time to look into Bitcoin most
[52:21] people hate it just haven't studied it
[52:22] there's probably small percentage of
[52:23] people who have looked into it a little
[52:25] and they still hate it but most people
[52:28] who look and even try to prove their
[52:30] their prove themselves right, right?
[52:32] They might be like, "I hate Bitcoin. I'm
[52:33] going to look into it to prove why it's
[52:35] wrong." And then they look into it and
[52:37] they go, "Wait a second. Wait a second.
[52:40] I can't prove that it's wrong or I can't
[52:42] prove that it's a scam, right? Or I
[52:43] can't prove why it has no value." So,
[52:45] they eventually come to the truth.
[52:47] That's literally my orange peeling
[52:49] journey. I wanted to prove someone wrong
[52:52] and I got orange pill that. It's it's an
[52:54] really important point to make why
[52:57] Bitcoin is is so powerful because it
[53:00] also has no head that you can actually
[53:03] attack.
[53:05] So this is probably this is the number
[53:08] one reason why Bitcoin is working
[53:11] because I think there is such a thing as
[53:13] bad publicity. If there's a head to
[53:15] attack, if there is an CEO that is
[53:19] attackable and saying like why are you
[53:22] doing that? like why you will like as
[53:25] long as there's no hat to attack every
[53:28] is really good for it because at some
[53:31] point 2017 where was Bitcoin mania in in
[53:36] my opinion retail mania this was where
[53:39] the highest point in the Google trends
[53:41] were where like bitcoin was in everyone
[53:43] and this tipping point will be reached
[53:45] again with complete uh for more of
[53:48] retail but we haven't been there since
[53:51] 2017 at some point will that tipping
[53:54] point come and that for point come where
[53:57] everyone talking about Bitcoin on the
[54:00] pro and on the contra side and someone
[54:04] that is just not aware about Bitcoin
[54:07] will ask
[54:08] himself why is everyone talking about
[54:11] Bitcoin like why do I hear about Bitcoin
[54:14] all day long they will research about it
[54:18] and the research is super simple
[54:21] Like if you imagine 2010, 2012, 2015
[54:26] even, it was super hard to get any
[54:28] Bitcoin information out there. Now in
[54:31] 205, 10 years later, we have like I
[54:34] don't know 50, 100, 200 Bitcoin only,
[54:38] Bitcoin only podcast, not Bitcoin and
[54:41] crypto, like Bitcoin only podcasts and
[54:42] content creators that are really good.
[54:45] Imagine in 10 years we'll have thousands
[54:50] of information warriors that will be out
[54:54] there and create content for Bitcoin.
[54:56] Make courses, make books, make articles,
[55:01] make
[55:02] digestible small snippets of content
[55:06] that will
[55:08] completely revolutionize how fast we
[55:11] will get orange build. I met people in
[55:15] 2025 that got orange built in 2025 and
[55:19] understand more about Bitcoin in the
[55:21] first two months of learning that I
[55:24] understood in the first 2 years. People
[55:27] are getting orange built way faster
[55:29] nowadays because the material is just so
[55:32] much better and this will only
[55:34] accelerate. The faster we'll orange pill
[55:36] people, the more people will come on
[55:37] podcast, the more people will start
[55:40] podcast, start Tik Tok channels, start
[55:42] whatever they want to start uh blogs,
[55:45] articles, books and the more people will
[55:48] it's a complete exponential growing at
[55:51] that point. So just look out 10 years
[55:54] from now and you will be astonished how
[55:57] everyone is talking about Bitcoin. Yeah,
[55:59] that's a great point. I mean, I agree
[56:01] with you that like the acceleration of
[56:03] the knowledge and yeah, probably, you
[56:04] know, a decade ago, it was much harder
[56:06] to kind of just the information's out
[56:08] there, but it's much harder to just like
[56:09] throw on a YouTube video and and go do
[56:11] my dishes. You know, it's probably
[56:12] Andreas Antonopoulos is probably like
[56:14] the main one who was doing that, right?
[56:16] Which why he's like such an OG. Well,
[56:17] that's a great transition point because
[56:18] I I do I love getting your thoughts on
[56:20] Bitcoin itself, but I'm also really
[56:22] interested in the fact that like your
[56:24] podcast, first of all, it's really
[56:25] ambitious that you're like, okay, I'm
[56:26] interviewing a Bitcoiner every day, like
[56:28] 365 days. You've interviewed almost 500
[56:30] people, I think you said, which is wild.
[56:32] So, I mean, I'm just interested in the
[56:34] journey sort of like what made you want
[56:36] to do it a daily like interview one
[56:38] person a day and then I don't know like
[56:40] how it's kind of how that's changed you
[56:42] like from when before you started the
[56:44] podcast to now and just interested in
[56:46] like how you felt that journey has sort
[56:48] of changed you or what you've learned
[56:49] from it. I came to the realization that
[56:51] Bitcoin is so important that I do not
[56:55] want to do anything else. I I do not
[56:59] want to spend any time not thinking
[57:01] about Bitcoin. I do not want to spend
[57:03] any time in fiat, in IT security, in
[57:06] whatever other industry you could spend
[57:08] your time in. I was in IT security
[57:10] before. And once you come to the re
[57:13] realization
[57:14] that if you're in a feared system and
[57:18] you work in a feared system, you make
[57:19] that feared system stronger because you
[57:21] put your life's energy in there. Even if
[57:24] your financial energy is completely out
[57:25] of that, that's why my first transition
[57:28] was let's get my financial energy out.
[57:31] 100% I was in Bitcoin. But then I also
[57:34] got my financial my actual life energy
[57:37] out of Bitcoin, out of uh the fiat
[57:41] system, out of IT security into Bitcoin.
[57:44] 100% of my financial energy is in
[57:46] Bitcoin. 100% of my life's energy is in
[57:49] Bitcoin. That's kind of the setup I
[57:50] wanted to do. Now I even go one step
[57:53] further and earn most of my income
[57:56] already in Bitcoin and spend some of my
[57:59] expenses already in in in Bitcoin. I
[58:02] don't know the percentages. It's
[58:03] probably like I don't know 20 30% what I
[58:05] spend in Bitcoin and like 70% what I
[58:07] earn already in Bitcoin. So I have to
[58:10] make some uh exchanges between Bitcoin
[58:12] and fiat to to cover bills. But the
[58:15] thing is you you get sucked into Bitcoin
[58:19] first. you just yeah it's a unique
[58:22] diversifier and then you get in like
[58:26] okay let's get a little bit more Bitcoin
[58:28] all of a sudden you're like go all in
[58:29] Bitcoin then you work in Bitcoin you you
[58:32] do your stuff in Bitcoin and you went I
[58:35] went really quick from hating Bitcoin
[58:39] thinking it's a scam to three years
[58:42] later actually discovering it buying my
[58:45] first like $100 of Bitcoin it was in
[58:48] 2020 and then I needed a year to go all
[58:51] in and then I needed two years to go
[58:53] also all in with my life's energy and
[58:56] you have that transition of like being
[59:00] against Bitcoin saying it's a scam to
[59:03] having all your money in it having all
[59:05] your life energy in it transacting most
[59:08] of the times in Bitcoin and being
[59:10] completely Bitcoinized so that's why I
[59:14] did it because I think Bitcoin is the
[59:16] most important thing and I want to
[59:18] capture
[59:19] the essence, the people and the
[59:24] time flare of this revolution. So, this
[59:30] is why I I I did a Bitcoin podcast. Why
[59:33] daily is a good question. Um, I started
[59:37] it because
[59:39] I had so many Bitcoin podcasts in the
[59:43] backlog and now it's kind of my brand
[59:47] that I do it daily. So, I kind of kind
[59:50] of can I cannot get it out now. Um, but
[59:54] honestly, I enjoy it a lot. It's a lot
[59:57] of work. As you know, as a podcaster,
[59:59] you you always think as someone that
[60:01] just maybe listens to podcasts, you're
[60:03] like, "Oh, like some two people come
[60:05] together and then talk. It's like 1 hour
[60:07] work." No, like 1 hour work is one
[60:10] aspect of it. There's planning, there's
[60:12] the post-production. So, actually, for
[60:14] me, one hour podcast is usually
[60:17] associated with like 5 hours of work. If
[60:20] you do that once a week, it's not too
[60:22] much. But if you do it every day, that's
[60:24] already 35 hours. that's already a
[60:27] full-time job. Uh then you have to do
[60:30] other things because of that. You all of
[60:32] the sudden have guest appearances on
[60:34] other podcasts. You all of a sudden go
[60:35] to conferences. You all of the sudden uh
[60:37] get requests from left and right. You
[60:40] all of the sudden have a thing that has
[60:43] to be managed. All of the sudden you
[60:44] have freelancers working for you. All of
[60:46] a sudden you have to manage those
[60:47] freelancers. You're like you get more
[60:48] and more and more around that one simple
[60:51] thing of just talking with people.
[60:53] So it is a lot of work and uh I love it
[60:58] every day a little bit more and uh it
[61:01] changed me a lot. Uh the the
[61:04] podcast made me realize uh important
[61:08] values. Uh it it it made me uh connect
[61:11] to traditional values more. It made me
[61:14] want to found a family more. It made me
[61:17] more driven, more motivated. uh the the
[61:20] podcast it it gave me a mission
[61:23] something something something to pursue
[61:25] in in life orange people and and getting
[61:29] the p bitcoin message out there so I
[61:32] think that's something bitcoin gave
[61:35] me that is not as not as tangible you
[61:41] you all those bitcoiners coming together
[61:43] and gathering that those information
[61:46] gathering those thoughts is something
[61:48] amazing that you can get from Bitcoin.
[61:50] It's uh it's it's a great it's a great
[61:53] thing to to have Bitcoin. I think that's
[61:55] awesome. I mean, that's really cool too
[61:57] that that that's done that for you and
[61:59] has, you know, it's done something
[62:00] similar for me and I think that that's
[62:01] an awesome sort of ancillary benefit of
[62:04] people getting into Bitcoin. Like I
[62:06] think the more you get into Bitcoin, the
[62:07] more it will find ways to change your
[62:09] life for the positive that aren't just
[62:11] financial, which is part of the reason
[62:13] why we love we all love it and sort of,
[62:15] you know, call us a cult, right? like
[62:17] you know we're kind of we kind of get a
[62:18] little crazy with how much we we love
[62:20] it. The one what I don't know this is
[62:22] probably a hard question to answer if
[62:23] you've interviewed you know almost 500
[62:24] people but like is there anything that
[62:26] stands out as like favorite interview
[62:28] you know favorite sort of quote or the
[62:30] most surprising or one of the most
[62:32] interesting things you've kind of
[62:33] learned from somebody? The most
[62:35] influential um for me was Jeff Boof. Not
[62:39] only because it was the first big guest,
[62:41] but he hammered down that message of
[62:46] what are you doing if you are all in on
[62:49] Bitcoin but still working in fiat. And
[62:51] this was the interview that tipped me
[62:54] over the edge of saying I will do this
[62:58] Bitcoin podcasting thing full-time. I
[63:02] didn't started full-time
[63:04] podcasting, but this was very
[63:06] influential for me. him saying the same
[63:10] message he always says, but he says it
[63:13] in uh such a great way that resonated
[63:15] with me so deeply where I said I have to
[63:18] do this Bitcoin thing. I I cannot waste
[63:21] time outside of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the
[63:24] most important topic, most important
[63:28] discovery in the universe. and I have to
[63:32] dedicate not only my money but also my
[63:35] time towards that one mission. I uh I
[63:39] kind of feel the same way. Like I've
[63:40] heard him say that, right? Like you know
[63:42] if all your life and energy is direct is
[63:44] in the fiat system, you're making that
[63:46] system stronger. And at first I kind of
[63:48] heard that and I I don't know maybe it
[63:49] kind of like hurt me a little bit. I was
[63:51] like it's like that's probably true but
[63:52] I don't want to admit that it's true.
[63:54] And so I was like oh I can't you know
[63:56] can't shift all my time and energy into
[63:58] the Bitcoin system you know obligations
[64:01] and responsibilities etc. But then over
[64:02] time I'm kind of like he's probably
[64:04] right. And like if I really want to like
[64:07] put my you know put my heart or my money
[64:10] where my mouth is or not literally my
[64:12] money but in this case my life force
[64:13] energy where my mouth is like you said I
[64:16] sort of am kind of trying to slowly do
[64:18] something I think similar to what your
[64:19] journey is which is put more and more
[64:21] energy towards the Bitcoin system and
[64:23] more and more energy towards Yeah. like
[64:26] espousing this thing that I believe in.
[64:27] Like you said, there's an important um
[64:31] there's there's one thing to consider
[64:33] here. Not everyone will work in Bitcoin
[64:37] because Bitcoin itself doesn't really
[64:39] need workers. Bitcoin just works in
[64:42] itself. So long term we do not
[64:46] need 80% 50% even like 40% work the
[64:50] workforce in Bitcoin.
[64:53] Why I'm saying that right now that it's
[64:56] so important for me to put my life's
[64:59] energy in Bitcoin is because I see the
[65:02] early potential of
[65:03] Bitcoin and that's why I want to
[65:06] dedicate my life's energy now into
[65:08] Bitcoin. But not every there's not
[65:10] there's not a lot enough space and work
[65:14] for 8 billion people in Bitcoin. Yeah,
[65:17] it will also not happen of course. And
[65:19] if you are a doctor, if you are a
[65:22] lawyer, if you do whatever you are
[65:24] doing, if you're an engineer, this work
[65:26] is super important that you're doing.
[65:29] And it's probably best for you to keep
[65:32] doing what you love and keep doing what
[65:34] you're good at and just stack Bitcoin.
[65:37] That's what Bitcoin is for. But for
[65:40] those early maniacs like us that really
[65:45] cannot shut up about Bitcoin, they are
[65:48] going all in Bitcoin. They are going
[65:50] also with their life energy in Bitcoin.
[65:52] But for the majority of people, it's
[65:55] probably best to do what they are doing
[65:58] at the com. I mean, if you're an
[66:02] accountant, you can apply at Bitcoin
[66:05] companies and do your same job there.
[66:09] That's totally possible. If you're an
[66:12] software
[66:13] engineer, maybe you want to develop on
[66:16] Bitcoin scaling solutions and work for a
[66:19] Lightning Labs,
[66:21] whatever. You can do
[66:23] that. But what are doctors going to be
[66:26] like? Like like there are certain things
[66:29] that not everything has to be around
[66:32] Bitcoin. It it sounds weird that I say
[66:34] that now,
[66:36] but the the important thing is I took my
[66:40] decision to put everything into Bitcoin
[66:44] because I just cannot. I'm a maniac. But
[66:48] there are non-maniacs, normal people out
[66:52] there that just want to do a great job
[66:54] at what they are doing. saving lives as
[66:57] a doctor, um being a mechanical engineer
[67:01] that repairs cars for a living. Like
[67:05] that's a great thing to do. You should
[67:07] keep doing that if you love it and just
[67:10] save in Bitcoin because Bitcoin
[67:12] ultimately is money. It's a life mission
[67:16] for
[67:17] us, but for someone else, it's just
[67:19] money and it's good like that. Bitcoin
[67:21] should not be Bitcoin doesn't has to be
[67:24] more than that for for an individual
[67:26] person. It's so much more for us. It's
[67:29] almost a spiritual journey for some
[67:31] others. So it's it's an important
[67:35] distinction distinction that I wanted to
[67:37] do here that people don't have to quit
[67:42] the job to find something in bit like if
[67:45] you really like cars and you're
[67:47] mechanical engineer that repairs
[67:49] cars and now you're like oh I have to
[67:52] learn software engineering to fit into
[67:54] this Bitcoin crowd thing. No you don't.
[67:58] you you can be a mechanical engineer and
[68:02] maybe orange bill your company or put
[68:05] Bitcoin on the balance sheet if it's
[68:07] your company or tell your customers
[68:09] about Bitcoin and you are a a soldier in
[68:13] the Bitcoin revolution by doing exactly
[68:17] that the there are different roles like
[68:20] I think we are in an information war for
[68:23] Bitcoin and what you are doing what I'm
[68:26] doing is basically
[68:28] being a digital soldier on the front. We
[68:32] are fighting right at the front where
[68:35] there is the fight happening between
[68:37] Bitcoin and Fiat. I'm going on a crypto
[68:40] and finance channels also. Not that a
[68:43] lot uh but here and there I go. So we
[68:47] are fighting the information war on a
[68:50] very
[68:52] um confronted and and on the front way.
[68:56] And then there's also people I I
[68:59] interviewed someone it was really cool.
[69:01] He just goes around his town and orange
[69:03] pills people. He just starts
[69:04] conversation with people and and talks
[69:06] about them uh about different subjects
[69:09] and then like hey there's also Bitcoin.
[69:11] and he just orange pills people around
[69:14] his
[69:15] town. All those people are really,
[69:17] really important for the Bitcoin
[69:19] mission. We need the offers. We need the
[69:21] podcasters. We need the mechanical
[69:24] engineer that just loves his job and
[69:26] talks about Bitcoin when there's a
[69:28] customer coming in. And maybe it's not a
[69:31] good strategy. Maybe you lose customers
[69:33] if you talk too much. But hey, it's it's
[69:35] your thing. Like you can do whatever you
[69:37] want. So my my my my thing is just you
[69:42] don't have to work for a Bitcoin company
[69:46] or found a Bitcoin
[69:48] company to
[69:50] be useful for the Bitcoin
[69:54] revolution or to be or or to be part of
[69:57] the Bitcoin revolution is I think is a
[69:59] better way of saying it. Yeah, I think
[70:01] that's awesome. I think that's a good
[70:02] message. Yeah, for sure. like everybody
[70:04] can find their own small way to sort of,
[70:06] you know, increase adoption or whatever.
[70:08] You know, it doesn't have to be Yeah.
[70:09] Like you said, all in with your whole
[70:11] life. Okay. Well, is there anybody you
[70:13] haven't interviewed yet that you really
[70:14] want to? I know you've had Sailor,
[70:15] you've had a Jeff, you had a lot of the
[70:16] big names. Anybody on the list who
[70:18] you're trying to get or haven't gotten
[70:20] yet? Uh, yes. Satoshi Nakamoto.
[70:25] Oh, man. I I've I've uh I've invited
[70:28] him. I sent him emails, but he he
[70:30] doesn't want to come on. Oh, his email
[70:32] address bounced probably. Yeah, that's
[70:34] too bad. He He's ghosting me. Yeah,
[70:37] that's too bad. All right. Well, last
[70:39] question, which I always ask, which is
[70:41] you obviously have your channel. If
[70:42] anyone hasn't seen it, Robin's putting
[70:44] out awesome uh content both on X, but
[70:46] mainly on YouTube. Obviously, there's a
[70:47] daily podcast coming out, Robin Ser on
[70:49] YouTube. But of uh outside of the
[70:52] content you put out, is there something
[70:54] else that you recommend to people or or
[70:55] either a source that you like to get
[70:57] your information or something else that
[70:58] you'd recommend to other people um to
[71:00] get information about Bitcoin? I'm a
[71:02] really uh people driven person. So if I
[71:06] want to find so let's I mean I can get
[71:12] you a list of great Bitcoiners uh like
[71:15] Larry Le pass Michael Sailor Czech Mar
[71:17] like they're all great but I think more
[71:19] interesting is from a methodical
[71:22] standpoint how to gather information
[71:24] about something you don't know about.
[71:26] People that watch this here probably are
[71:28] aware of some Bitcoin podcast. probably
[71:30] can manage how to get the Bitcoin
[71:33] content. How I do it with something new
[71:35] for example I will figure out who are
[71:39] the top people to talk about that on uh
[71:44] in in a specific industry who are the
[71:47] key persons in an industry and those
[71:50] those key persons are have usually
[71:52] podcast appearances somewhere. So I see
[71:55] hey this guy let's say let's make the
[71:57] example with with with you're just
[71:59] discovering Bitcoin then you're like
[72:01] okay Michael Sailor seems to be a key
[72:03] person in Bitcoin then you're giving in
[72:06] Michael Sailor Bitcoin interview then
[72:08] you there's like 50 popping up directly
[72:10] and you just click through the first
[72:12] three ones that have the most views and
[72:14] you're like okay like I get it now but
[72:16] who else like oh like Selina Moose seems
[72:18] also be a big one Jeff Boo you go just
[72:20] down the list and what you also see Like
[72:24] with Ciphodine, most of them have a book
[72:26] also. So you're like, okay, there's like
[72:28] those five to 10 people that are the key
[72:31] persons and you you see the language,
[72:34] you see what they're talking about, you
[72:35] see the the the topics that they're
[72:37] talking about. Then the next step is go
[72:40] deeper on that. Not only listening to
[72:42] podcast, podcast is amazing to get like
[72:44] a first teaser of the information, but
[72:47] then maybe they have a book. Then you
[72:50] figure out what are the five most
[72:51] influential books in in an industry.
[72:53] Let's let's read those. And you're going
[72:55] down the line of like, oh, those are
[72:57] interesting uh books. And and then you
[73:00] can decide, do you want to go deeper on
[73:02] on a topic? Do I want to do I have
[73:05] enough? Uh with Bitcoin, it's usually
[73:07] like it's just a starting of the
[73:09] journey. And then it goes down like, oh,
[73:11] there's like not only the first and
[73:13] third and and and fifth podcast, but
[73:15] there's also like a 20th podcast that is
[73:18] also really cool. Uh there there are
[73:21] I've se on on on YouTube. There are
[73:23] people that are really YouTube podcast,
[73:27] Bitcoin chunkies. They I I go to another
[73:30] podcast and there's a guy that always
[73:32] comments on my comments al also comments
[73:35] there like they're all over the place
[73:36] because they just love listening to
[73:38] Bitcoin
[73:39] stuff because it's so early like okay
[73:44] but the important thing here is we we
[73:48] can digest now information in a very
[73:51] nice way because we can figure out who
[73:53] are the top people in an industry kind
[73:56] of get a feeling for what's important
[73:59] And from those conversations of who
[74:01] they're talking about, what they're
[74:03] talking about, why they're talking about
[74:04] it, and how they're talking about it,
[74:06] you get a lot of information out there,
[74:08] and then just dive deeper with the
[74:10] books. And if you want to go deeper on
[74:12] that, h it might be also interesting to
[74:15] write your own thoughts down and and
[74:17] work with with those those books and uh
[74:20] maybe find courses, maybe find
[74:22] deepermies. there there deeper things
[74:24] that you usually can go on, but books
[74:27] are usually already like very nice to to
[74:30] cover information. That's my advice of
[74:33] how to get information, how to to figure
[74:36] an industry out and and how I would also
[74:38] say, "Hey, figure that that out with
[74:40] with Bitcoin also." Yeah. No, I love
[74:43] that. That's awesome. You just uh don't
[74:44] just give a man a fish and teach him how
[74:46] to fish. Like, here's how to dive deep
[74:47] on a new topic when you want to know the
[74:49] information. And like we touched on
[74:50] earlier, I think you're right that right
[74:52] now is probably the best time in history
[74:54] to have easy access to as much Bitcoin
[74:57] information as possible. So, it's fun
[74:59] diving in and finding out all the
[75:01] different resources. Like you said,
[75:02] Robin, u this is awesome, man. I really
[75:04] appreciate it. I I appreciate you taking
[75:06] the time and I appreciate the work you
[75:07] do spreading the Bitcoin message and uh
[75:09] I enjoy your show. You're an inspiration
[75:11] in terms of like how much you've grown
[75:12] with your content and and how much
[75:14] you've grown the channel and all that
[75:15] stuff. So, I really appreciate you
[75:17] taking the time to come on. It's been
[75:18] super fun talking to you. Thank you so
[75:20] much. It was an honor.
