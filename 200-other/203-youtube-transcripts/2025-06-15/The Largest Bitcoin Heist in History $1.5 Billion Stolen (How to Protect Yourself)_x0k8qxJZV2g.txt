[00:00] I've been actually able to recover a few
[00:02] million dollars of assets for people who
[00:05] either lost their assets in a way that
[00:07] they did some kind of a self-inflicted
[00:09] loss on themselves, messed up something
[00:11] with their wallets or actually from
[00:13] thefts. I think you may heard about the
[00:15] bite hack which was like $1.5 billion
[00:19] like equivalent of that in Ethereum and
[00:21] it's called like the biggest money heist
[00:23] in history. That's how Ethereum does
[00:26] multi signature. They do it with smart
[00:28] contracts. is different from how we do
[00:30] multi signature on Bitcoin. Their CEO
[00:32] said like our cold storage was attacked
[00:34] like this and like every everybody in
[00:36] the Bitcoin space was like saying dude
[00:38] that's not cold storage. when you sign
[00:40] transactions and as soon as you sign the
[00:42] transaction, this transaction gets sent
[00:44] on the internet. That's not cold story,
[00:46] but like I have a lot of crazy stories
[00:48] actually. It's not only the
[00:49] impersonators or the scammers like the
[00:52] biggest your stack becomes, you need to
[00:55] put more and more like with more Bitcoin
[00:58] comes more responsibility. here.
[01:02] [Music]
[01:05] For a few people that that might not not
[01:07] know you, um, who are you and and and
[01:09] why are you in bit in into Bitcoin?
[01:12] Well, I've been in the Bitcoin space for
[01:14] a really long time. I consider myself as
[01:17] mostly a Bitcoiner. So, I've been like
[01:20] building communities, building uh like
[01:23] writing down a lot of resources,
[01:26] um recording a lot of educatory material
[01:29] on YouTube, uh podcasts. I've been doing
[01:32] all sorts of stuff in the space for
[01:34] mostly uh to be specific in the Middle
[01:37] Eastern community and uh to be even more
[01:41] specific mostly for the Iranian
[01:43] community uh which uh which which is
[01:46] like uh the community that I was
[01:48] participating most of the time and uh
[01:52] I've been in the space since 2017 a few
[01:55] months before the August soft fork for
[01:58] SegWit and that was one of the first
[02:00] things that I actually fascinated me
[02:02] about Bitcoin and how decentralized it
[02:03] is and how it works and that just got me
[02:06] in the space and I've been like uh since
[02:09] I've been doing a lot of educator
[02:10] material there was a lot of consulting
[02:13] requests and I've been doing a lot of
[02:15] consulting for uh like security privacy
[02:19] and all sorts of like Bitcoin
[02:21] solutions and I've been working on these
[02:24] things security uh Bitcoin security and
[02:29] research I've been working with a lot
[02:31] open source tools and actually sometimes
[02:34] even contributing to them to make them
[02:37] like uh make the community grow even
[02:40] more because they are like uh like one
[02:43] of the most fascinating and amazing
[02:45] things about Bitcoin actually. uh to see
[02:48] people putting the time and effort to
[02:50] write so so much of an excellent and
[02:53] secure code and uh like as much as I can
[02:57] I would always help them and try to uh
[03:00] get more and more people on board to
[03:03] using them especially uh like
[03:05] considering the security precautions of
[03:09] like like Bitcoin is worth a lot these
[03:12] days. So, it's like uh I don't know the
[03:15] price right now. It's $80,000. I don't
[03:18] know $90,000 or something like that. So
[03:21] few years ago we were always saying that
[03:25] you got to learn more about Bitcoin
[03:27] security and you have to secure your
[03:29] Bitcoin setup because
[03:31] uh you will need it since probably
[03:34] Bitcoin will reach big numbers in the
[03:37] future and you need to like uh start
[03:41] this early just in case if Bitcoin's
[03:45] price goes up and you cannot then afford
[03:47] to lose your Bitcoin. And this is the
[03:49] case right now these days. There's so
[03:53] many great security solutions out there.
[03:55] And uh I am happy to participate in the
[03:59] community for building security products
[04:02] and things like that and like consult
[04:05] people on that. Yeah, it's super
[04:06] interesting when we talk about self
[04:08] custody and and the security solutions.
[04:10] I always I always try to tell
[04:14] people if Bitcoin would 10x tomorrow,
[04:18] would you still be comfortable with your
[04:20] self-custody setup? because I think most
[04:22] people have not thought it through
[04:25] really good and they have some big
[04:29] security holes in their solutions and if
[04:31] they would think about what if my I
[04:35] don't know I let's say I hold 50,000 uh
[04:38] uh euros in in Bitcoin what if it would
[04:41] be 500,000 would you think differently
[04:44] about your security solution most thing
[04:46] most people probably think differently
[04:48] then and would maybe invest a little bit
[04:51] more time or or money uh in into doing a
[04:54] really good security solution. So I
[04:56] think I like the way of hey what if what
[04:59] if that thing you're securing here is a
[05:01] way more way more worth than than
[05:04] previously. Um but before we get into uh
[05:07] security and all
[05:08] that I usually talk with either
[05:11] Americans, Europeans, sometimes
[05:14] Canadians and Australians. So we really
[05:16] don't get a lot of insights in the
[05:17] Middle Eastern community honestly. uh
[05:19] the roose paper was on and then some
[05:21] other people but like not too many.
[05:24] What's going on currently Middle Eastern
[05:27] community in Bitcoin? How do how does
[05:29] grassroots movement look like? How does
[05:31] the uh politics uh look at Bitcoin and
[05:34] all that things? Yeah, that's that's
[05:36] actually a rather big topic. So if I
[05:40] want to start with a community, it would
[05:42] be like it's it's very cool. It's kind
[05:45] of different that the
[05:47] the requirements for these communities
[05:50] usually are different from others. So a
[05:53] few years ago, we were always talking
[05:56] about how
[05:57] Bitcoin will be a better test if if it
[06:02] is being utilized or if it is actually
[06:06] something that matters.
[06:08] uh it would be better in environments
[06:11] like Middle East and especially places
[06:13] that are like under heavy financial
[06:15] restrictions and that's where like
[06:17] sometimes Alex Glasing cames into the
[06:19] picture when he talks about like check
[06:22] about the the thing that he always says
[06:24] like check your financial privilege
[06:26] because there's so many places on earth
[06:28] that they don't have the financial
[06:30] privilege of the western communities and
[06:32] the western uh people and that's the
[06:35] case if you want to see it uh how
[06:38] bitcoin
[06:39] how important of a thing Bitcoin could
[06:42] be. You could you should definitely take
[06:44] a look at the at these uh places and see
[06:48] like when people are facing a lot of
[06:51] inflation, a lot of censorship uh and a
[06:54] lot of like financial exclusion, what
[06:57] would they be doing? And uh that that's
[07:00] where Bitcoin is actually shining. And
[07:02] like a lot of people look at Bitcoin in
[07:06] the probably in the best way to look at
[07:09] which is like uh Bitcoin could be
[07:12] utilized as something that will give you
[07:15] a lot more financial freedom. It could
[07:18] um offer you a lot of the uh benefits
[07:22] that uh you have not actually uh
[07:26] experienced before. uh you could do
[07:28] global transactions, send money abroad,
[07:30] send money all over the world and uh
[07:34] also store the value of your work and
[07:38] your time and efforts you have put
[07:40] because a lot of the local and national
[07:43] currencies in some parts of Middle East
[07:45] actually uh not all of them but uh are
[07:49] are very subject to
[07:50] inflation especially uh if we uh if we
[07:54] uh refer to the Iranian community
[07:56] because uh there is like a a crazy
[08:00] amount of inflation there going on and
[08:02] that's something where like Bitcoin is
[08:05] really shining for people like they they
[08:07] they really love it there but uh with
[08:10] with like just like with all other
[08:12] communities there's like uh there's a
[08:16] lot of like crypto stuff and shitcoining
[08:19] happening also there's a lot of like
[08:21] scams hacks attacks all sorts of stuff
[08:24] happening which is kind of usual the
[08:26] usual case for everywhere. So it it is
[08:29] to be expected. But uh this is like one
[08:32] of the coolest thing about the Middle
[08:33] Eastern part of like the Middle Eastern
[08:36] audience of Bitcoin that's they
[08:39] understand Bitcoin and they get it much
[08:41] more than the Westerners. It's like yeah
[08:43] this is cool. This is something that we
[08:45] actually need and they use they use
[08:48] Bitcoin. A lot of people have Bitcoin.
[08:51] um they they have started like building
[08:54] businesses like startups, companies,
[08:57] things like that about Bitcoin and how
[09:00] to use it. Uh they also use a lot of
[09:03] stable coins which which is still the
[09:06] case for many parts of the world again
[09:08] but uh which is like you cannot ignore
[09:11] the fact that stable coins are kind of
[09:15] convenient to use for some people. So
[09:18] they we like as much as we love to talk
[09:20] about Bitcoin and consider the most
[09:22] important thing which is it is like this
[09:25] is something that we cannot ignore
[09:27] actually this is something that happens.
[09:29] So people do use stable coins and they
[09:31] use they use them a lot and uh well in
[09:35] the Iranian community to be more
[09:37] specific to that part of the Middle
[09:40] East will a lot of people just get their
[09:44] hands on Bitcoin or actually any other
[09:48] coin not only Bitcoin just for the fact
[09:52] unfortunately on any other coin because
[09:54] like they do like get like a lot of
[09:57] coins get promoted to get rich quick
[10:00] schemes. So people would consider that
[10:02] if I buy this I may get rich
[10:06] quickly and the case is that uh the
[10:10] reason that there's a lot of attraction
[10:13] and a lot of uh attention to
[10:16] cryptocurrencies in a place like let's
[10:19] say Iran. It would be due to the fact
[10:23] that they have been suffering from
[10:26] inflation for a really long time that
[10:28] they have forgotten how a better asset
[10:31] looks like. So whenever they see
[10:35] something that holds value better than
[10:39] their national currency, which is like
[10:41] basically anything, it's like you could
[10:44] you could take anything. Just just name
[10:46] it and it's going to hold value better
[10:48] than the national currency.
[10:50] So they just get get on boarded. So it
[10:54] doesn't matter. So inflation have driven
[10:56] them to uh to invest their hardearned
[11:01] money into something that could be
[11:04] better than their fiat currency. And it
[11:07] doesn't matter if it's Bitcoin, stable
[11:08] coins, or shitcoins that may dump. Even
[11:12] the shitcoins that may dump may prove
[11:15] better than the fiat currency there. So
[11:18] that's why a lot of people just just it
[11:20] just you don't need to sell it to them.
[11:22] It's like they understand it. If it's
[11:24] not the fiat currency, it's probably
[11:26] worth uh like holding your money in. So
[11:29] that's the case with the Iranian
[11:32] community and also the other communities
[11:34] that deal with a lot of uh
[11:37] inflation. But for uh like some other
[11:40] parts like uh like in Dubai it's it's uh
[11:44] it's there's a lot of people talking
[11:46] about be talking about how big of a
[11:49] crypto hub or actually uh yeah that's
[11:53] what they say. So it's the crypto hub
[11:54] they call it. But uh I've seen I'm
[11:57] seeing like more and more and more
[11:59] Bitcoiners coming to this part of the
[12:01] region because like uh because how it's
[12:05] much more friendlier than other parts of
[12:07] the world uh towards Bitcoin and you
[12:11] could like uh do uh business and it's
[12:14] easier to set up a bitcoin business here
[12:18] and all sorts of stuff like that similar
[12:20] to it. So it is and also it is very uh
[12:23] efficient on the tax side. So that's
[12:26] what have made a lot of global and
[12:29] western bitcoiners also uh actually
[12:33] reach this part of the world and uh like
[12:37] get involved more. So there's actually a
[12:39] very cool bitcoin community in Dubai
[12:42] too. So uh uh and a lot of those people
[12:45] you have probably met before or you have
[12:48] even had them on your podcast. So it is
[12:50] a nice community that is growing here.
[12:54] That's also something very interesting
[12:56] about the community crypto actually the
[12:58] Bitcoin community here uh in this region
[13:00] of the world. Yeah. And you are where
[13:04] are you in Dubai or I'm based in Dubai
[13:07] right now. Yeah. Interesting. I also I
[13:09] also love the fact that you said uh the
[13:12] inflation drives people to basically
[13:14] anything that holds value better which
[13:16] is almost everything if inflation is
[13:18] bad. And I've seen this over and over
[13:22] again with Argentina, with all the
[13:25] different places where you can basically
[13:27] have or like Turkey where you have so so
[13:29] so much such a bad
[13:32] inflation where
[13:34] people you drive them to be crazy. You
[13:37] you drive them to meme coins that have
[13:39] absolutely no value at all. And you're
[13:42] like, "Oh, like, okay, I put money in
[13:44] there. Oh, it it it made like a I don't
[13:47] know 10x in in a short period of time.
[13:50] That's I guess the the the level I have
[13:52] to play with. And people forgot how to
[13:55] save the the the they the unlearn how to
[13:59] actually save money and just build a
[14:01] future for themselves, which is very
[14:03] very very sad to see. And and and
[14:06] Bitcoin kind of wants to bring that
[14:08] bring that back. And I hope we can
[14:11] overcome uh that to a certain extent and
[14:14] we can get back to saving and bitcoin
[14:16] and and uh not the craziness and the
[14:19] shitcoinery and the meme coins where
[14:21] there's just no value and people just
[14:23] speculate.
[14:25] Yeah. So it is it is like that. And I
[14:28] know a there's
[14:30] like so this one is kind of difficult
[14:34] probably to explain but so the amount of
[14:37] Bitcoiners and
[14:41] shitcoiners in in the western
[14:44] communities maybe like let's say just
[14:46] just throw a number. So let's just say
[14:49] it's one to like one bitcoiner to every
[14:53] nine
[14:55] shitcoiners here. it would be more
[14:58] bitcoiners because there's more people
[15:02] who understand bitcoin. It's like uh
[15:05] they it's like okay shitcoins that's
[15:07] something that you could like do all
[15:10] kind of kinds of activities like
[15:12] gambling they do with it like they call
[15:14] it trading but it's like basically
[15:16] gambling. So they you could you could do
[15:19] that with
[15:20] it. But they do understand Bitcoin more
[15:23] here because like
[15:26] uh they get pushed towards it because
[15:29] like uh you're going to have bit more
[15:34] Bitcoiners learning about Bitcoin from
[15:37] governments rather than from other
[15:39] Bitcoiners and YouTubers and podcasters.
[15:42] So it's like they hear about Bitcoin,
[15:44] they see the value in it and they just
[15:47] stick to it because it's very easy for
[15:49] them to uh because they they were
[15:51] actually waiting for something like
[15:53] Bitcoin to just come across the path. So
[15:56] that's how I could see it and it is like
[16:00] there's a lot of like good Bitcoiners in
[16:02] the space that are not actually known in
[16:04] the in the global community communities
[16:07] but they are actually doing a lot of
[16:09] work. they're doing. So I call like
[16:12] education as God's work.
[16:14] and they're doing God's work here,
[16:16] actually writing stuff, translating. Uh
[16:20] actually that may this may be surprising
[16:22] to you but there's so many open-source
[16:26] content like publicly free available in
[16:30] the like let's say the uranian bitcoin
[16:34] community that you may be surprised and
[16:37] like most of the books most of the
[16:41] articles most of the good content in the
[16:43] global community in the western
[16:45] community mostly are translated and
[16:50] provide it to everyone in the in the in
[16:53] the Iranian community. Like I know of
[16:56] one of the latest efforts is like some
[16:58] of the people are actually uh
[17:01] collaborating with each other to
[17:02] translate Lin Alden's book and they're
[17:06] actually uh releasing it chapter by
[17:08] chapter obviously like this this they
[17:11] they did get the consent from the
[17:14] writer.
[17:15] And there's all sorts of book like even
[17:19] some p podcasts get translated and uh
[17:22] published and sent out to other people
[17:26] and there's a huge community just
[17:29] uh waiting for these content and they
[17:33] they they are hungry for more and more
[17:35] content to be translated to their local
[17:39] uh language and they just start reading
[17:42] it and consuming this content. So it is
[17:45] very cool that there's not much
[17:48] sponsoring or payments or not much like
[17:53] um actually funding that goes into this
[17:56] kind of a content generation about
[17:58] bitcoin in this part of the world is
[18:00] actually there's zero so uh content
[18:03] funding or uh things like that but it is
[18:07] very very active and it is like thriving
[18:11] there's so many people like translating
[18:14] a lot of the bitcoiny books in the space
[18:16] and you get surprised to see that. So it
[18:19] is kind of cool.
[18:21] Why why is there no content funding?
[18:25] Because well that that's your own. So
[18:27] you cannot like fund content
[18:31] like easily for the Iranians that like
[18:34] there's so many like sanction laws and
[18:37] things like that. So you won't be seeing
[18:40] uh a player in the space to fund the the
[18:43] the production of content for the
[18:46] Iranian community unless like the
[18:50] content like gets produced like overseas
[18:53] or something and then gets uh actually
[18:57] distributed in the in in in in Iran. So
[19:00] there's all sorts of limitations like
[19:02] that and everybody just so they just
[19:05] took the job on themselves and they're
[19:07] doing it without like
[19:09] uh waiting for someone to fund their
[19:12] work. So but they're doing like a a
[19:15] great job. So there's there's one
[19:18] project that is called the that is
[19:21] called Bitcoin D.M me and it's uh it's
[19:25] the biggest
[19:27] repository of Persian translated content
[19:32] for
[19:33] Bitcoin and it's like there's so many
[19:36] books like the block size war like
[19:39] inventing Bitcoin from Pritska there's
[19:43] uh the the article from VJI there's few
[19:47] episodes from Stfan's podcast there's
[19:49] all sorts of books and uh guides on
[19:52] lightning, on node management, on
[19:55] security, on privacy. It is like very
[19:58] very cool. And you see this is all an
[20:01] open-source like collaborative effort
[20:03] which is like sometimes uh the
[20:05] collaborators are anonymous.
[20:08] Ah super cool. Yeah. Just one I mean
[20:10] because
[20:12] um I I love like all probably all
[20:15] educators and and content creators start
[20:17] out with with not making money. there
[20:20] this it's it's I rarely saw a project
[20:23] where they got prefunded in the content
[20:25] creation space but it's uh it's it's
[20:29] it's hard to keep going if you have no
[20:32] funding maybe it's in Bitcoin easier if
[20:35] you have been in Bitcoin earlier so
[20:36] Bitcoin itself kind of can fund you so
[20:40] that that was just that's interesting
[20:43] that that so there's basically the the
[20:45] the the law is in the way so so legally
[20:48] they they cannot get funded and there's
[20:50] restrictions. Interesting. But it's
[20:52] great that it's still there like that
[20:54] that the the space is really good even
[20:58] without the funding because obviously if
[21:00] you see I mean even this podcast gets
[21:02] funded and and and has sponsors and
[21:04] partners otherwise I I wasn't I couldn't
[21:07] just do it like I it's my full-time job
[21:10] now and it's like uh if if I have no
[21:12] funding at all I would still do it but
[21:16] not every day. I would probably do it
[21:18] like once a week, something like that.
[21:20] Uh, so I couldn't do it uh with that
[21:23] high of quality and that high of
[21:26] quantity. So it definitely definitely
[21:29] helps. But it's great to see that there
[21:32] is a community that just just does it
[21:34] because it's an important job to do uh
[21:36] even if they have to find funds for
[21:38] their lives somewhere else. Um, and it
[21:41] and also you you wrote me that you
[21:44] investigated scams a lot and there's so
[21:47] many scams going on and I see just I'm
[21:51] not investigating scams but I see so
[21:54] many scams because my telegram gets
[21:56] used, my Twitter gets used with
[21:58] impersonating and and people sending me
[22:01] all the screenshots when someone tries
[22:03] with an impersonating account uh how
[22:07] they get uh getting scammed.
[22:10] And it's really crazy how good they they
[22:13] get and how good they are with social
[22:16] engineering. What kind of scams are you
[22:18] investigating for for for Bitcoin
[22:21] security?
[22:23] Yeah. So that's actually uh one cool
[22:26] part of the things that I've been doing
[22:28] for a long time now. Uh I've been
[22:30] actually So okay, you just you just made
[22:34] that point so it's much easier for me to
[22:37] explain now. you just said that people
[22:39] do contact you about these things.
[22:42] That's that that was also the reason for
[22:45] me uh that I got I was like being
[22:48] contacted like hundreds of times
[22:51] uh for people who got hacked, scammed or
[22:54] actually lost money even due to like
[22:58] self-inflicted loss. So, you know, like
[23:00] people losing their 24 words or like
[23:04] messing up something on their wallet or
[23:07] doing something like that. So, there
[23:09] I've been receiving like thousands of
[23:11] them probably over the years and I've
[23:14] been in the space for a long time. So,
[23:16] I've seen like at least probably 2 3,000
[23:21] uh like messages and requests, and I've
[23:25] been trying to respond to many of them.
[23:28] Obviously, not all of them. That's kind
[23:30] of impossible to do, but I've been
[23:33] responding to a lot of them. And uh over
[23:36] the years I gained the experience of how
[23:38] like the scammers and the hackers
[23:41] and other cases of like bad like
[23:45] misfortunes or bad situations that could
[23:47] happen to people. And uh since I was
[23:51] receiving a lot of these uh messages and
[23:54] requests, I started like telling people
[23:57] about them and even producing some
[23:59] content about it on my YouTube channel
[24:01] at that time. And uh there was a lot of
[24:04] interest in that a lot of people did uh
[24:07] were audienced for that and I started
[24:10] just digging more into these kind of
[24:13] things. So um and I sometimes I even
[24:16] like I had like I have a lot of crazy
[24:20] stories actually. It's not only the
[24:22] impersonators or the scammers or I don't
[24:25] know nowadays like in the last 2 years
[24:28] or or so there's also uh a very popular
[24:32] method of scamming that is called like
[24:34] pig butchering scam which is uh kind of
[24:38] a very like odd and strange and uh wild
[24:42] name which is uh sort of a sophisticated
[24:47] uh these cold call requests sending
[24:51] messages uh kind of a scam like people
[24:54] send you a message they tell you are you
[24:56] interested to invest but uh that's
[24:58] that's kind of easy to detect nowadays
[25:01] pig butchering is like this kind of a
[25:02] scam but 2.0 tool is like the the the
[25:06] better version. So it's like they send
[25:08] you a message, they engage in
[25:11] communication and conversation for a
[25:13] long time with you to get your trust.
[25:15] They even send you like voice messages,
[25:18] pictures, they get on video calls with
[25:21] you actually. So it's it's like you you
[25:24] trust them. So it's like they gain your
[25:26] trust and then they do the same scam and
[25:28] then there's this platform you could
[25:30] invest in it and now you have gained
[25:32] their tr the victim's trust. So that's
[25:34] what they do. Most of these scams are
[25:37] operated as like big organized crime in
[25:40] Southeast Asia mostly. So it's not
[25:43] limited to that part of the world but
[25:44] it's mostly operated
[25:46] there which is kind of an interesting
[25:49] topic on its own. You could like look it
[25:51] up see it more. It's it's been happening
[25:54] a lot quite uh quite a lot uh lately in
[25:57] the last one or two years and uh there's
[26:01] been all sorts of like crazy stuff that
[26:03] I followed up. Uh I've been actually
[26:06] able to recover a few million dollars of
[26:09] assets for people who either lost their
[26:12] assets in a way that they did some kind
[26:14] of a self-inflicted loss on themselves,
[26:16] messed up something with their wallets
[26:19] or uh or actually from thefts. So
[26:23] there's there has been like thieves that
[26:25] I've been working like I've worked on
[26:27] cases where I caught some thieves which
[26:30] was like kind of cool and thrilling to
[26:32] do uh to find that. And in order to do
[26:35] that I actually utilize a lot of my
[26:39] knowledge in like the Bitcoin
[26:40] technicalities. It's like there's a lot
[26:42] of transaction attributes. There's a lot
[26:44] of um things on the Bitcoin network that
[26:48] you could look at and study and analyze
[26:51] and get to a result from. Like there's
[26:55] so many attributes, there's so many
[26:57] things
[26:58] that it's it's like it's a basically a
[27:01] financial network which is publicly
[27:04] available. So you could consider like
[27:06] you could think about all the things
[27:08] that you could do is like um somebody
[27:12] gets access to you like a colleague or
[27:14] someone who is malicious and takes your
[27:16] funds away uh tricks you maybe installs
[27:21] a spyware a malware they get incent
[27:24] incentivized because they know like you
[27:25] have like probably few bitcoin that's
[27:28] that's worth a lot so they get
[27:30] incentivized they install something
[27:32] malicious on your firmware when you're
[27:34] on your lunch break uh on your computer
[27:37] or something and then they take your
[27:39] money away whenever they get the chance
[27:42] to. But uh like it it is kind of
[27:46] interesting to know that most of these
[27:49] people could be easily caught because
[27:51] they're not like very sophisticated and
[27:54] advanced
[27:56] uh like attackers. So they don't have
[27:59] like the best knowledge in like uh
[28:03] hiding and offiscating the funds. So it
[28:06] is uh kind of interesting to follow up
[28:09] on them and what they do with it. And
[28:11] once you get a clue and you follow that
[28:13] clue or lead it becomes to a lead. the
[28:16] lead
[28:17] becomes probably into some evidence and
[28:20] the evidence could take that person to
[28:23] court and like at that time the asset
[28:25] becomes se get seized if if they if
[28:29] they're willing to give give back the
[28:31] assets and uh that was like one of the
[28:34] most thrilling and interesting things
[28:36] that I've been doing in the last few
[28:38] years and I am always interested in such
[28:40] things because it is like kind of
[28:42] interesting for anyone it's like it's
[28:44] like you're doing police and detective
[28:47] work without needing to be able police
[28:51] because all the data is out there
[28:53] publicly available. Uh recently I've
[28:57] been working mostly on following the bi
[29:00] hackers. Uh I I I think you may heard
[29:04] about the bibbit hack which was like
[29:06] $1.5 billion dollar like equivalent of
[29:10] that in Ethereum. Uh, and it's called
[29:13] like the biggest money heist in history.
[29:16] It's like it's very big. It's like
[29:19] $1,500 million. So that's like that's a
[29:23] lot of money for people who may not
[29:25] grasp the sheer amount of that. And it
[29:28] it is to be like it's affiliated with
[29:31] DPRK affiliated hackers. And I've been
[29:34] following on that doing all sorts of
[29:36] research because these hackers now are
[29:39] very organized in laundering the money.
[29:41] And it is like it is kind of interesting
[29:44] to try to find how they are structuring
[29:47] and automating their money laundering
[29:49] and to find out about like what they're
[29:52] doing. Uh and in order to do that you
[29:55] need to be aware of all sorts of
[29:57] technical stuff about like Bitcoin
[29:59] transactions, addresses, Bitcoin data
[30:02] and build the data, analyze it, put some
[30:06] like uh put put some uh methods for uh
[30:12] uh tracing the the the money in in in
[30:15] new ways that these uh attackers who got
[30:19] away with the money now may want to
[30:22] launder. under it. So there's all sorts
[30:25] of interesting
[30:27] stuff,
[30:29] sorry, happening right now at this
[30:31] moment that we're talking. They're very
[30:32] prolific in their work and it's a lot of
[30:35] money to launder. So it takes a lot of
[30:37] time for them to do that and it is quite
[30:42] an interesting research that I've been
[30:44] doing in the last few weeks that I have
[30:47] actually f did uh get a lot of findings
[30:50] from which I may not be able to disclose
[30:53] all of them. So just just for that like
[30:56] the tip off principle so you won't tip
[30:58] them off but uh there's a lot of f uh
[31:02] findings and some of the bitcoin
[31:04] businesses in the ecosystem I've been
[31:06] communicating with them providing them
[31:09] with uh the the the
[31:12] the findings that are related to them.
[31:16] So would they would know how to mitigate
[31:18] this to stop their services from being
[31:20] used by these hackers. So, it's it's
[31:22] kind of thrilling and very adventurous
[31:24] kind of a thing to do to follow on this
[31:28] big money heist and see what they're
[31:31] doing with the money and uh just get
[31:33] some knowledge from it. Just get some
[31:36] more experience, spread awareness about
[31:39] it and things like that. I love it. You
[31:42] are our Bitcoin detective now.
[31:45] Yeah, I've been doing this for a long
[31:47] time and I had a lot of success actually
[31:50] recovering money before. So now it's
[31:53] like in the last year or so I'm been I'm
[31:56] I'm like upgrading my research and
[31:58] investigation stuff to big players like
[32:02] the organized kind of big teams that are
[32:05] doing a lot of hacking which is like one
[32:07] of them is the private hacker right now.
[32:10] So, it's like, okay, the small cases are
[32:13] easier nowadays for me. So, let's get to
[32:15] the bigger ones and see what we can
[32:17] find. Let's take a break for a moment
[32:19] and appreciate the beauty that Coin
[32:22] Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[32:24] watches. Those watches are the most
[32:27] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[32:30] that you are a true Bitcoiner. and Coin
[32:33] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[32:36] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[32:39] watch collections. You have the date of
[32:42] the first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[32:45] there and of course also the block
[32:47] height and which epoch we are currently
[32:50] in. I love the level of detail they put
[32:53] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[32:56] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[32:58] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[33:01] love those watches. so so much. And now
[33:04] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[33:07] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[33:09] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[33:11] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[33:13] first way is you put it on a hardware
[33:15] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[33:18] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[33:21] Bitbox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[33:24] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[33:27] if you check out the link in the
[33:29] description, you even get 5% off if you
[33:32] use the code Robin. And the second way
[33:34] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[33:37] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[33:41] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[33:43] They will personalize for you a
[33:46] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[33:48] your individual situation. They will
[33:51] show you how you can secure your own
[33:54] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[33:56] enough. You also have to keep all your
[33:58] devices secure. One topic that is
[34:00] overlooked often is the inheritance
[34:03] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[34:06] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[34:08] a plan for that in place already? And
[34:11] last but not least, if you're in a
[34:13] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[34:15] it's better to get a plan B for all
[34:18] that. Head over to the
[34:21] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[34:24] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[34:27] be for the first time ever speaking at
[34:30] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[34:32] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[34:35] really looking forward to seeing all of
[34:37] you there. You can get your ticket in
[34:39] the link down in the description of
[34:42] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[34:44] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[34:48] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[34:49] there. Maybe um because I think most in
[34:54] the Bitcoin space probably heard about
[34:56] buy bit uh or read about in the news,
[34:59] but uh as you investigate, it would be
[35:01] really fun to to hear what actually
[35:04] happened. Uh because it's so much money,
[35:07] it's really hard to understand that just
[35:09] like one group just got that
[35:12] money. It's not his like, oh yeah, they
[35:15] stole two bitcoin somewhere and stuff
[35:17] like that. It's like it's a lot of
[35:18] bitcoin. It's a lot of money. Uh how did
[35:21] this happen? And and and what have you
[35:23] gathered so far? Yeah. So what happened
[35:27] uh
[35:28] like in the
[35:30] first forensic report that private
[35:33] actually published with the
[35:37] collaboration with a few forensic teams.
[35:40] It was like the North Korean like they
[35:43] call like DPRK North Korean affiliated
[35:46] hackers. They call them Lazarus. They
[35:48] call them trader traitor which is like
[35:50] the subbrand of Lazarus. So it's kind of
[35:52] difficult to pinpoint which name we
[35:54] should be using but we let's call it the
[35:58] bbit exploiter. So the bybit exploiter
[36:01] have gained access to some like uh
[36:05] servers or things like that that let's I
[36:08] don't want to get very technical super
[36:10] technical and it is not the most
[36:11] important thing how exactly the
[36:15] technicalities how they carried out the
[36:17] attack. It's more important for us as
[36:20] Bitcoiners, people in the space who use
[36:22] Bitcoin to know how to protect against
[36:24] the attacks
[36:26] uh by sticking to some standards because
[36:29] like this is what what I always tell
[36:32] people there's a million ways of uh that
[36:35] you may be be attacked also there's a
[36:39] million other ways that have not been
[36:41] yet
[36:42] discovered and you cannot go over all
[36:45] the million ways. So what you can do is
[36:48] to stick to the very fewer standard and
[36:51] best p practice work that you can do to
[36:55] just mitigate all the millions of ways
[36:58] that you could be attacked. So that's
[37:00] what I talk about. So it's like they got
[37:03] access to some servers. They did change
[37:07] uh some of the things you see on the
[37:09] screen. Uh so what bybit was using was a
[37:14] multi- signature
[37:16] wallet called safe
[37:18] wallet on uh on Ethereum and that uh in
[37:23] order to use that wallet uh few of the
[37:27] executives on by bit including their CEO
[37:30] and co-founder
[37:31] uh needed
[37:33] to approve transa approve signatures for
[37:37] money to be spent and What they did the
[37:41] the BB bit exploratory what they what
[37:43] their team did was to show something
[37:45] different on the screen and uh
[37:48] the BBIT people thought that they're
[37:52] moving something standard a routine work
[37:56] procedure like they're moving uh some uh
[37:59] amount of
[38:00] Ethereum but they were signing a very uh
[38:05] malicious transaction instead which was
[38:08] a transaction to change the ownership of
[38:11] that uh smart contract. Like that's how
[38:14] uh Ethereum does multi- signature. They
[38:17] do it with smart contracts. This is
[38:19] different from how we do multi signature
[38:22] on Bitcoin which is like quite different
[38:24] and it's it's like it's offline. It's on
[38:26] the computer. You do it uh finalize it
[38:30] on the computer rather than on the on
[38:32] the public blockchain with the smart
[38:34] contract. So they took ownership which
[38:37] is like kind of strange for us in the
[38:39] Bitcoin uh ecosystem. Like why do you
[38:42] mean what do you mean by taking
[38:43] ownership of a multi- signature wallet?
[38:46] Because like you could grant
[38:49] permissions to anyone you want uh
[38:52] actually and any quorum of signers to be
[38:56] able to spend money. That's how like
[38:58] safe wallet works. And why didn't they
[39:02] detect it on their hardware wallets?
[39:03] because they were using hardware
[39:05] wallets. Actually, to be more specific,
[39:08] I think most of them use ledgers. Here's
[39:10] a ledger. And because like for smart
[39:14] contract related transactions on
[39:16] Ethereum, it shows a message called a
[39:20] blind signature, blind signing process
[39:23] because it's like a hash of a data you
[39:26] sign. It's not the exact data. And the
[39:30] the the the clueless wallet does not
[39:34] know what he's signing and you cannot
[39:36] understand what you're signing because
[39:37] it just s shows some gibberish on the on
[39:41] the wallet screen. And this is something
[39:44] that we could like just take some good
[39:47] hits on Ethereum for having uh that uh
[39:51] like uh even Ledger says accept risk and
[39:54] sign because it doesn't know what you're
[39:56] signing because you cannot see what
[39:57] you're signing on the on the ledger
[40:00] screen and that's how it was happened.
[40:02] So it was a different thing you see on
[40:04] the screen. You're sending a normal
[40:06] Ethereum transaction but it is actually
[40:09] changing the ownership of the smart
[40:11] contract.
[40:12] and they approved it because they just
[40:15] didn't have enough uh uh like standard
[40:20] secure procedures uh because uh first
[40:24] they needed to do cold storage probably
[40:27] that's that's also something interesting
[40:30] their CEO said like our cold storage was
[40:33] attacked like this and like every
[40:35] everybody in the Bitcoin space was like
[40:36] saying dude that's not cold storage when
[40:39] you when you when you sign transactions
[40:41] and as soon as you sign the transaction,
[40:43] this transaction gets sent on the
[40:44] internet. That's that's not cold
[40:46] storage. The cold storage happens on an
[40:48] offline computer. So, they were like
[40:51] signing
[40:53] uh with uh online systems and signing
[40:58] something that can they couldn't see on
[41:00] this screen of ledger because it didn't
[41:03] like that's how smart contracts and
[41:04] ethereum work. So, you cannot understand
[41:06] what you're signing actually on the
[41:08] screen here. and the transaction was
[41:10] relayed in the network and then the
[41:12] hackers were able to take over all the
[41:14] funds in that uh in that Ethereum uh
[41:19] multi- signature wallet which was a lot
[41:21] of money uh 1.5 billion and then they
[41:24] started doing so I'm talking about
[41:26] Ethereum but I was like talking about
[41:28] like Bitcoin ecosystem stuff so the
[41:31] hackers started the operations and they
[41:35] have been moving a lot of money around a
[41:37] lot of money with a lot of
[41:40] transactions. There's like probably
[41:43] 15,000 Bitcoin addresses associated with
[41:47] this operation of money laundering at
[41:49] this moment that we're speaking. And
[41:51] it's like and this happened actually 2
[41:54] months ago. So they have used only like
[41:57] 15,000 bit Bitcoin addresses up to this
[42:00] moment to just launder the money to just
[42:02] move fast and uh so others won't catch
[42:05] up to them like investigators,
[42:07] researchers like me won't catch up to
[42:09] them. And they're moving funds fast.
[42:12] They're moving it to all sorts of
[42:14] destinations. They do coin joins. They
[42:16] do swaps. They do like crosschain
[42:19] swapping. Like they go to Ethereum. They
[42:21] go back from Ethereum to Bitcoin. They
[42:23] go from Bitcoin to Solana. from Solana
[42:25] to Bitcoin, they do all sorts of crazy
[42:26] stuff and it's like they just don't want
[42:29] you to be uh tracking them. So that's
[42:32] how they they they increase the cost of
[42:34] investigating and researching them this
[42:37] way. And they've been doing this. They
[42:39] have uh I could say probably
[42:41] successfully laundered probably about
[42:43] $und00 million up to this moment, but
[42:45] this is don't quote me on that. Uh it's
[42:48] like just observations, not hard fact.
[42:52] And uh but there's a lot of a lot more
[42:55] to be laundered and which I'm actually
[42:57] keeping a track on. There's a lot of all
[43:00] all other teams. It's not only me.
[43:02] There's so many other teams that are uh
[43:04] looking to this. Actually, there's a
[43:06] bounty out there for this. So if you are
[43:09] able to help confiscate or free some of
[43:11] these funds, you got to get 10% of the
[43:14] free frozen funds. So that's also a
[43:17] motivation and incentive for people who
[43:20] want to uh research more. And if there's
[43:23] any researchers who are interested in
[43:24] this, feel free to hit me up. We're
[43:26] going to talk about this.
[43:29] Yeah, 10% can be a lot of money in that
[43:32] case. If there's what if there's a few
[43:35] hundred millions now frozen, there is uh
[43:38] probably like a billion left to to to
[43:41] still discover and 10% of that. Uh I
[43:44] mean obviously it will be very hard
[43:46] because it seems like they're very
[43:47] sophisticated. It's actually how long
[43:50] have they been working on that before or
[43:53] on that? Do you have any hints of like
[43:56] how prepared they they doing that? how
[44:00] long such a thing takes and how long
[44:02] have they been observing
[44:04] uh how they operate in by bit because
[44:06] they need obviously information how how
[44:09] they are doing things right yeah that's
[44:12] something that there have been a lot of
[44:14] criticism towards by bit that they have
[44:16] not been the most transparent about we
[44:19] are not completely sure how the whole
[44:22] thing happened because by bit hasn't
[44:24] publicly announced
[44:26] uh many things about that so there's
[44:29] like very few introductory reports from
[44:31] forensic teams, but there's no uh like
[44:34] complete reports that show when their
[44:38] infiltration happened when how the
[44:41] infiltration happened completely. We
[44:43] don't know like the first the first day
[44:47] that the attack the attack
[44:49] happened even I was one of the people
[44:52] who thought that okay this has to be
[44:54] some kind of an insider job because like
[44:57] okay how do you get access to so like so
[45:00] many you need like you're you're
[45:02] tricking a lot of signers like there's
[45:06] five I don't know four cosigners that
[45:08] you need to attack all at the same time
[45:10] to be able to
[45:12] uh actually trick all of them to approve
[45:15] this transaction. So that's going to be
[45:17] very difficult to
[45:20] do. The only one who could get access to
[45:23] many people in the same organization, it
[45:26] would be like someone from the same
[45:28] organization. So that's that was like
[45:31] one of the few first thoughts that I
[45:33] had. But like seeing how things are
[45:35] going on and what's happening is like
[45:38] it's probably not an insider
[45:40] job and it's probably uh something that
[45:44] Bit needs to talk more about and so we
[45:46] could understand what exactly happened
[45:49] and how they got some some of these
[45:51] accesses from their usual MO which is
[45:55] like modus opi which means like soph
[45:58] like fancy way of saying like their mode
[46:00] of operations. Uh they usually do all
[46:03] sorts of social engineering attacks to
[46:07] like get access to some of the systems
[46:09] like they send emails affected like
[46:12] malicious emails, links, things like
[46:15] that to people who work in the in the in
[46:17] the organization and then start building
[46:20] their way up to uh get the accesses they
[46:25] need.
[46:27] So that's probably the thing that
[46:30] happened like some of the colleagues or
[46:34] employees there or some of the
[46:35] executives got attacked by uh spear
[46:39] fishing or some kind of a sophisticated
[46:41] social engineering attack to have like
[46:44] some kind of a malware or something like
[46:47] that installed on their systems and then
[46:49] they started the operation but it's like
[46:52] I would be very interested to read uh a
[46:54] lot of details about the tax if there's
[46:57] these details if they get out. Super
[46:59] interesting to to see that. Yeah. And
[47:01] also um I think people have
[47:05] celebrated that they have converted
[47:07] things to Bitcoin but it was uh it was
[47:10] just
[47:11] about covering their tracks uh or or was
[47:14] there also something like oh like we
[47:16] wanted in the end of the day in in
[47:18] Bitcoin or they just converting it to to
[47:21] covering their track because I've read
[47:24] some things after it happened no like
[47:27] they are converting everything to
[47:28] Bitcoin because they know it's a
[47:30] shitcoin
[47:31] It it it does have like I think I I also
[47:35] think that it does have some sense in it
[47:38] especially uh like if I if I was the
[47:43] attacker and if I wanted to hold these
[47:45] funds for a really long time until I can
[47:49] launder it little by little over
[47:51] time. I wouldn't like to hold that much
[47:54] money on Ethereum
[47:56] probably and I wouldn't like to like
[47:58] this is also from an investment part of
[48:00] things because like it's Ethereum it's
[48:02] not going to you're going to lose money
[48:04] probably if you hold Ethereum for a
[48:06] really long time and it's also that uh I
[48:11] probably would need better like privacy
[48:15] tools and tool set and a lot of
[48:17] liquidity at the same time and this will
[48:21] be offered by Bitcoin better than
[48:23] Ethereum. So, it's better to use Bitcoin
[48:26] if you were the private
[48:29] exploer. One also other cool interesting
[48:32] thing about this
[48:35] uh is that the private
[48:38] exploer cannot easily launder
[48:43] Ethereum and offramp it to cash
[48:47] probably. So it's easier to offramp
[48:49] bitcoin, sell bitcoin and get cash
[48:52] because like at the end cash is king and
[48:55] they will use cash at the end. And the
[48:58] best tool actually to
[49:01] uh uh like what what is the widest and
[49:05] most common uh asset that is being
[49:09] traded probably for cash all over the
[49:11] world at this moment like crypto wise
[49:15] it's probably Bitcoin and USDT. It's one
[49:19] of these two or it's like either one of
[49:22] them or or these are the top two. So
[49:26] it's either Bitcoin or you swap Ethereum
[49:30] to Bitcoin and then move Bitcoin around,
[49:32] move it through coin join, move it
[49:34] through different source of things. So
[49:37] you would offiscate the track and then
[49:38] go back to I don't know Ethereum or Tron
[49:41] or something like that and make it USDT
[49:43] because USDT can freeze the funds so
[49:47] they won't cover that part. So they
[49:50] won't be their funds won't be frozen and
[49:53] then they swap the USDT easily for cash
[49:56] because it is like widely
[49:58] uh this this is kind of a wide widely
[50:00] accepted things all over the world and
[50:03] like in Southeast Asia in Middle East I
[50:06] probably less in Europe or places like
[50:09] that because like there's less cash
[50:13] flow flow funds of cash in in probably
[50:16] in Europe. I'm not very sure about that,
[50:19] but it's much less than other parts of
[50:21] the world. And that's how probably they
[50:23] move it to cash. So, they prefer
[50:27] probably USDT because there's like
[50:29] everybody accepts us
[50:32] everywhere. Okay. I just figured out
[50:35] that probably people from USDT tether
[50:38] won't like what I'm saying right now.
[50:40] And uh but but it's okay. And
[50:44] uh we know that I know for sure that
[50:47] USDT and Tether are uh working so hard
[50:51] to stop these kind of our operations and
[50:53] they have been actually collaborating
[50:55] with Bybit under and also with TRM labs
[51:00] and
[51:01] Tron under financial crime unit uh named
[51:07] uh T3 which is like Tether
[51:10] uh Tron and TRM and they've been like
[51:14] freezing a lot of assets. So, they're
[51:16] doing a good job at that front, but it's
[51:18] like it doesn't like uh means that
[51:21] they're this is not happening. It is
[51:23] happening and they use USDT and you they
[51:25] use Bitcoin because these two could be
[51:28] easily like much easier than others
[51:31] converted to cash. It's super
[51:33] interesting because I think we can all
[51:35] learn things from that. What have you
[51:37] actually from investigating so many
[51:39] different scams and also being really
[51:42] really clever on on self custody and
[51:44] security uh what have you learned so far
[51:47] how people can better protect themsel
[51:51] um when they already have self custody?
[51:54] So obviously um if if you have an
[51:58] exchange there's whole different attack
[52:00] vectors and and it's it's probably
[52:03] easier but uh if they have cold storage
[52:06] if they have self custody cold storage
[52:09] um where they sign transactions and
[52:13] let's say someone is actually having the
[52:15] the bad a good setup where they have
[52:18] multi- signature. So someone has
[52:19] actually put in the work has a multi-
[52:22] signature setup. what have you learned
[52:24] to to make those things even more secure
[52:29] uh and and figure out how to not get
[52:31] scammed and stuff like that? Yeah,
[52:32] that's that's actually a very
[52:34] interesting thing topic actually to
[52:36] discuss and it is very important for
[52:39] Bitcoiners. It's much less important for
[52:42] shitcoiners. I don't think that you you
[52:44] would have a lot of like shitcoin
[52:45] audience because like you're a Bitcoiner
[52:47] just like me and like I'm Hey, I'm
[52:50] wearing Bitcoin orange right now.
[52:52] So yeah, so uh shitcoiners do not care.
[52:57] It's like they don't care about
[52:58] security. Most of the tools that they
[53:00] use is like the they're rubbish. Like I
[53:02] I've been experimenting with a lot of
[53:06] tools and software. So I I know for a
[53:09] fact that they don't care because if
[53:10] they cared, they would have better tools
[53:13] on their hands, but they don't have to
[53:15] good tools for security. But Bitcoiners,
[53:18] come on. There's a lot of good tools out
[53:21] there. There's multi- signature. There's
[53:22] all sorts of stuff. There's all sorts of
[53:25] good content about and also uh the like
[53:29] security material that you can read
[53:31] about and uh read and learn from. And
[53:35] the first thing that I would say is like
[53:37] to do this just just learn more about it
[53:40] because you you're going to need it like
[53:42] digital security not only bit your
[53:45] Bitcoin security digital security as it
[53:48] like as the uh the the uh how do you say
[53:52] this like the the biggest bigger
[53:55] umbrella term
[53:56] here has become very very important in
[54:00] the last 10 to 15 years and uh It's it's
[54:04] not only because of your Bitcoin. If you
[54:07] have Bitcoin now, you're it's inevitable
[54:10] for you. It's it's like very very
[54:12] important for you to do that as soon as
[54:15] possible. But if you have uh like if you
[54:19] even if you don't have Bitcoin or if you
[54:21] have small amount of Bitcoin like
[54:23] digital security is very important these
[54:25] days. It's it's not it's it's it's a
[54:28] hard fact right now. So you need to
[54:30] learn and one of the first important
[54:33] things that you need to learn about is
[54:35] that security all comes to comes comes
[54:38] down to uh how much security do you need
[54:42] and uh in like you need to adjust all
[54:45] the time. So if you want to protect like
[54:47] let's say $100 of assets that's not
[54:50] something that you need to
[54:52] pay a big amount to secure it. You don't
[54:57] need to put a lot of effort to secure
[55:00] it, right? But as like the biggest your
[55:04] stack becomes, you need to put more and
[55:09] more like with more bitcoin comes more
[55:11] responsibility here. So there's more
[55:15] responsibility to protect your assets.
[55:17] So the more bitcoin you have the more so
[55:20] it's it's not only because like for some
[55:23] people in the world if one bitcoin is
[55:26] very very very valuable for some people
[55:29] in the in other parts of the world like
[55:32] 10 bitcoin would be less valuable for
[55:34] them because it's just like uh that's
[55:37] that's how how much they value the
[55:39] assets they have. It all depends on how
[55:43] much you value and if you value your
[55:45] Bitcoin a lot, you need to pay like put
[55:49] a lot of time, effort, resources into
[55:52] learning about security. So this is the
[55:54] first thing just consider learning and
[55:57] the second thing would be to stick to
[56:00] best practices. So this is like the like
[56:03] I I just I did actually refer to this a
[56:08] few minutes ago. who was like you need
[56:10] to stick to the best practices because
[56:12] you cannot learn about all the attacks
[56:14] that could happen. It's like millions of
[56:17] way right now and millions of way that
[56:20] we are not aware yet. So they have like
[56:23] the hackers have a lot of incentive.
[56:25] They have a lot of time and they have a
[56:27] lot of resource like there's a lot of
[56:30] incentive in this. So you attack you
[56:32] hack someone you get take the money it's
[56:34] like millions of dollars in a second. So
[56:37] there's a lot of incentive for them.
[56:39] They're going to come up with new ways.
[56:41] They're going to always find new ways to
[56:43] do uh that just like how scammers come
[56:46] up with new ways, just like how this
[56:49] always happens. Like this is like
[56:51] intuitive. This is like
[56:53] obvious. But you need you cannot like
[56:56] learn all the how to mitigate all of the
[56:59] attacks. You need to stick to best
[57:01] practices.
[57:03] And during all the years that I was
[57:05] involved with
[57:06] Bitcoin, actually the most, this is very
[57:11] interesting. This may be very
[57:12] interesting for you, Robin. The most
[57:15] common thing that happens to people and
[57:17] lose Bitcoin is people do self-inflicted
[57:21] loss. It's not getting hacked or
[57:23] scammed. It's like people mess up
[57:25] something about their own wallets. This
[57:27] is this happens more than hacks. And
[57:31] this just reminds us of how you're not
[57:35] sticking like people are not sticking to
[57:37] best practices and standards. Like
[57:39] there's a reason there's some best
[57:41] practices and standards. I've seen so
[57:44] many people cut up their seedword,
[57:47] scramble the
[57:48] seedword, like do all sorts of
[57:50] adventurous stuff with the seedwords. I
[57:53] don't know, like add some kind of an
[57:55] algorithm to it and mess up the number.
[57:58] And this is like basically the one of
[58:01] the first basic things not to
[58:04] do in in in in for Bitcoin security.
[58:08] Just don't don't touch the C. Don't
[58:11] change anything about it. Just stick to
[58:13] what the manual tells you to do. This is
[58:17] like just just I'm just going to the
[58:19] very basic ones. You see, it's like
[58:22] these are the most important things. But
[58:25] to get back to your question, if they
[58:27] have learned and if they have did all
[58:30] sorts of stuff like multi- signature and
[58:32] things like that, that's actually like I
[58:35] would say congratulations. This is like
[58:37] very good uh amount of time and effort
[58:40] you put into this. And that's very good,
[58:42] very impressive. But you still if you if
[58:46] if the amount of Bitcoin is big, you
[58:49] still probably need uh and you're not
[58:52] very comfortable, you you still you
[58:55] probably still need to uh learn a bit
[58:58] more about like how this thing works
[59:00] actually the multi- signature probably a
[59:02] little bit about how the math works
[59:04] because like you're investing a lot,
[59:06] you're putting a lot of time into like
[59:08] setting up and multi- signature and
[59:10] things like that. So, it's better to
[59:12] learn a little bit more about it and
[59:15] learn about all this bad things that
[59:17] could go wrong and just mitigate those.
[59:20] And I would then
[59:23] also consider telling these people to
[59:28] uh just go think outside of the box.
[59:31] It's not only about your Bitcoin. It's
[59:34] also about your private and sensitive
[59:36] information to the world. like you
[59:39] should probably run your own node. This
[59:42] is one of the most important things to
[59:43] keep your IPs private and your addresses
[59:46] private to
[59:47] yourself. And you should probably use
[59:50] like good VPNs uh and like things that
[59:55] would protect data from being
[59:57] leaked more. And you should ver like
[60:02] consider
[60:04] uh um doing and reading more about OBSC
[60:09] operational security more and more. You
[60:11] shouldn't talk about your Bitcoin
[60:13] publicly. You shouldn't let others know
[60:16] like uh you have Bitcoin. I've seen like
[60:19] most of the cases that I was able to
[60:21] recover assets from were actually uh
[60:25] people from their surroundings attacking
[60:28] them. So it was like somebody like a
[60:31] colleague, an employee or uh like a
[60:35] friend. Sometimes friends are not
[60:37] friends anymore, but they do look like
[60:40] friends and all sorts of things like
[60:42] that. Even family members like a nephew,
[60:45] a niece. I've seen all sorts of stuff
[60:48] like this. I even se seen like wives do
[60:51] that. So So uh there's all sorts of
[60:55] things that could go wrong. So
[60:57] just keep your OBS sec just keep your
[61:01] operational security. Don't talk about
[61:03] it. Don't tweet about it. Don't post
[61:04] addresses. Don't just just don't let the
[61:08] world know about your
[61:10] financial
[61:12] information. And we actually do that
[61:14] like with bank accounts. We usually
[61:17] don't talk about like which bank we're
[61:19] using. We usually don't talk about uh
[61:22] what's our bank account number or
[61:24] something. We usually don't tell people
[61:27] how much balance do we have in our bank
[61:30] accounts. So why stop do this for
[61:33] Bitcoin too. So Bitcoin is not uh very
[61:37] different from that. It's the same model
[61:40] and you need to keep the information
[61:42] about it private and also
[61:46] uh you need to uh consider that Bitcoin
[61:51] may be even more uh more of a lucrative
[61:55] uh kind of an asset for people who think
[61:58] of attacking or like hacking or scamming
[62:01] because it's easier for the scammer and
[62:04] the hacker to move the funds around and
[62:07] try to offiscate the path. So you should
[62:12] like consider operational security very
[62:14] very uh good like it's like it's like
[62:17] it's it's it's a it's just like very
[62:22] obvious in the future we're going to
[62:24] have much more attacks coming from the
[62:26] surroundings because Bitcoin would gain
[62:29] more and more value. I love the that you
[62:33] put out the first point of
[62:36] self-inflicted loss and I see people
[62:38] building mazes for themselves that they
[62:40] couldn't cannot figure out
[62:42] later. Uh and it's very unfortunate but
[62:46] also a good message that this is the
[62:49] most uh common one how people lose their
[62:52] bitcoin because then we can go back to
[62:55] the basics because why do people build
[62:57] mazes? I usually found that they are
[63:00] scared that someone hacks them that
[63:02] scared that someone finds the bitcoin
[63:04] and like gets them and they are getting
[63:06] hacked scammed
[63:08] whatever and that's why they are
[63:10] building scams so good that they not
[63:13] even themselves can hack them. So, uh,
[63:17] like G getting back to the basics and
[63:20] not building a a maze for
[63:23] yourself and doing self custody, doing
[63:26] multi- signature
[63:27] um, and and all those things and and
[63:30] maybe have
[63:31] like have like different layers if if
[63:34] you one of the people that move Bitcoin
[63:37] around a lot, have like a second wallet
[63:39] where it's eas easily acceptable. Uh,
[63:42] and then one where you have your
[63:43] long-term savings in there and stuff
[63:45] like that. had any feel actually um as a
[63:48] question for you if you have um and and
[63:53] I I think you also mentioned uh maybe
[63:55] I'm imagining that that you worked in
[63:58] the past with or now with high net worth
[64:00] individuals. Do you recommend of having
[64:04] many different uh self-custody setups uh
[64:08] from a certain point onwards where you
[64:09] just like have diversify on like oh I
[64:12] have the multi- signature I have uh
[64:15] different multi- signatures I have a
[64:16] single say and all those different
[64:18] wallets to further protect against
[64:20] attacks.
[64:22] Yeah, this is actually a very very good
[64:24] question.
[64:25] So what uh what people need to know is
[64:30] that uh so one part of like me saying
[64:33] that you need to learn more or getting
[64:36] like receive education or and also
[64:39] consulting it would be to just uh
[64:43] evaluate if you need what you need for
[64:45] your setup. So there's all sorts of
[64:48] tools out there, great tools. Like I
[64:51] have actually a lot of like hardware
[64:54] walls just here sitting like I I do a
[64:57] lot of testing all the time. And there's
[64:59] so many good tools out there. There's
[65:01] not no single thing that will rule them
[65:03] all. And you need to see
[65:08] which what works best for you and for
[65:11] your situation. That's why you need to
[65:13] learn constantly. So you say like okay I
[65:16] I have a family office I need multiple
[65:19] people to get access to multiple stuff.
[65:21] So now you need to do some kind of a
[65:24] multisync. So it's it's like you cannot
[65:26] do single sync where there's some kind
[65:29] of a collaborative custody or a shared
[65:31] custody. So this is like I I am trying
[65:34] to make the point that based on your uh
[65:38] special and unique situation you may
[65:42] come into like I have this experience of
[65:47] consulting an
[65:49] individual that was uh like he wanted to
[65:53] do multisc but he wanted to do multisig
[65:55] in a way that even he himself cannot
[65:58] access his coins like easily if he wants
[66:01] too. And I was like, "This is kind of
[66:03] strange. Why do you need that?" He was
[66:05] like, "I don't live in a very very safe
[66:09] environment." So, I don't want like if
[66:11] people find out I have Bitcoin, they
[66:14] would like uh $5 wrench attack me into
[66:18] giving them my Bitcoin. I would I would
[66:20] like to not be able to give them my
[66:23] Bitcoin. So this was like quite
[66:25] interesting to see like some people do
[66:27] require even more than just multi-
[66:30] signature and like there's all sorts of
[66:33] other stuff like for companies,
[66:34] businesses, treasuries like inheritance
[66:37] situations also. There's all sorts of
[66:40] arbitration stuff that could happen that
[66:43] you need you probably need solutions for
[66:45] them for those ones too. So there's all
[66:47] sorts of stuff that you could consider
[66:50] based on your specific scenario. But you
[66:53] if you're the average
[66:55] Bitcoiner, I would say that yeah, it is
[66:59] uh better to separate your hot wallet
[67:01] from your cold storage. Cold storage, it
[67:04] has the name on it. It's going to be
[67:05] cold. It's not going to be accessed
[67:08] often. And there's this thing about like
[67:11] human beings generally that they prefer
[67:15] the easy method. So if if you want to do
[67:18] a very secure thing and if it's not
[67:21] easy, they're not going to follow it.
[67:24] They're going to ignore it. They're
[67:25] going to forget about it. They're going
[67:27] to stop using the the very secure method
[67:30] that is not easy to uh use. So, let's
[67:35] keep the not very easy method of cold
[67:37] storage on its own and keep a hot wallet
[67:41] like not a hot wallet actually like an
[67:43] exchange or something, but let's keep a
[67:45] wallet on your phone with significantly
[67:48] less amount of Bitcoin on it just for
[67:50] your daily spends probably or I don't
[67:53] know whatever you do with your Bitcoin
[67:55] and to spend it, you trade it, you do
[67:57] what and use that one for that purposes
[68:01] and hope that probably in the future
[68:03] they will be Bitcoin vaults in the next
[68:06] probably 5 years or so that would have
[68:09] like staging areas and rate limiting
[68:11] kind of wallets. So you would have a
[68:13] cold storage that you maybe you feel
[68:16] comfortable like accessing all the time
[68:18] because if something bad happens to it,
[68:20] there's going to be a staging area where
[68:22] your Bitcoin stays and you could like
[68:24] probably cancel the transaction. But
[68:26] we're away from that right now at this
[68:29] moment. We haven't we don't have the the
[68:32] the Bitcoin
[68:35] uh actually
[68:38] uh capabilities and the abilities
[68:41] enabled in Bitcoin right now like
[68:44] probably in the future we will have such
[68:46] stuff with like some kind of a covenant
[68:49] proposal or something or offchain kind
[68:52] of solution but right now at this moment
[68:55] it's better to just separate the two
[68:58] because Well, keep the This is actually
[69:02] also this also does work with uh digital
[69:06] security overall. So, I've seen a lot of
[69:10] people to they don't use their usual
[69:13] like the the the the card to the amount
[69:16] the the the bank that they have the most
[69:18] uh money on for online purchases or I
[69:22] don't know uh suspicious or I I don't
[69:26] know like less secure and less safe
[69:29] untrusted places. So, they just use a
[69:32] card. They just top up the card with a
[69:36] less amount. So if something bad happens
[69:38] to that card, so it won't uh they won't
[69:41] lose a lot of money. So this is just the
[69:43] same thing. So it does make sense, but
[69:46] try to keep your hot wallet on your
[69:48] phone kind of private and don't don't
[69:51] let people know that you have Bitcoin.
[69:54] Um kind of hard with a Bitcoin podcast.
[70:00] Yeah, that that ship has sailed for both
[70:03] of us because I've been publicly
[70:06] speaking about Bitcoin for so long now.
[70:08] So, yeah, I like to have a Bitcoin
[70:11] podcast, but I don't I don't believe it
[70:12] in myself. I don't have Bitcoin. I I I I
[70:16] still keep my euros in my bank account.
[70:19] So I maybe we could demotivate the
[70:22] attackers by saying that we actually
[70:25] have shitcoin so it's not worth
[70:28] attacking so keep away from us.
[70:30] Absolutely. Um really really really
[70:33] cool. Um I have have a gazillion other
[70:37] questions. Um but I think we covered the
[70:39] basis and I think we covered a lot and I
[70:42] think the by bit story was was really
[70:43] interesting. And I have one question
[70:45] that I ask each and every one of my
[70:47] guests. uh uh on the podcast and the
[70:49] question is what can we learn from you
[70:51] besides Bitcoin? Oh well so that's
[70:55] that's kind of an interesting question I
[70:57] was not prepared for but this is kind of
[71:00] cool. So uh I'm actually a very a very
[71:05] passionate person about what I do. So
[71:07] that's how that's what I would like tell
[71:10] others. It's like uh be passionate about
[71:13] what you do. Uh, always like just stick
[71:16] to what you like to do. So, I've been
[71:18] doing like Bitcoin stuff for a long time
[71:21] just because like I love this. So, it's
[71:24] like it's just so much fun to work on uh
[71:28] Bitcoin stuff. So, it's like all sorts
[71:30] of cool people, cool projects, cool
[71:33] technologies happening and uh cool stuff
[71:38] that could happen that makes me very
[71:40] interested in that. And that's why I
[71:43] wouldn't change this for anything else.
[71:45] Like I wouldn't change anything about
[71:46] what I do actually. That's because just
[71:50] I I I love what I do and that's I that's
[71:53] what I would like advise others to do.
[71:55] Like stick to what you love to do. I
[71:57] love that one. Uh we I think I don't
[72:00] know if we ever had that. I think we had
[72:03] work on some something you're passionate
[72:05] about but I I love that one a lot. Um,
[72:08] we have end in the podcast where the
[72:10] previous guest is asking a question for
[72:12] the next guest without knowing who the
[72:13] next guest actually is. And the previous
[72:15] guest asks you the question, do you
[72:17] think we get to a Bitcoin standard
[72:19] peacefully? Yeah, that's that's that's
[72:22] cool.
[72:23] No, it's not a peaceful
[72:26] thing. So, that's that's what I think.
[72:29] So, Bitcoin
[72:31] is some kind of a political kind of a
[72:34] movement. So in order to get to a lot of
[72:38] people using Bitcoin, there's has to be
[72:41] So this is the the the thing that I
[72:43] think Eric Wasll also talks about. It's
[72:47] Bitcoin is that that's what he calls it.
[72:50] Bitcoin is darknet money. So uh it's
[72:54] like it's that's that's what Bitcoin is.
[72:57] It is here to be censorship resistant.
[73:00] it is here to be uh unstoppable and
[73:05] that's what probably let's say
[73:08] governments won't like about Bitcoin and
[73:11] uh we could like see that and uh we have
[73:14] this trend in the last probably century
[73:18] or so that governments want more and
[73:21] more and more control into observing and
[73:25] doing all sorts of
[73:27] uh uh all sorts of uh surveillance and
[73:32] control over people's money and
[73:35] transactions and
[73:37] businesses that Bitcoin is I I think
[73:40] Bitcoin is a very good response to that
[73:43] that you should like to to go against
[73:47] that and uh well well that's the case
[73:53] Bitcoin if if it wants to succeed it
[73:55] needs to be
[73:57] resilient this is like very obvious
[73:59] obvious and it needs to be resilient
[74:01] against this too and uh it's a constant.
[74:06] So I I see like I I may look like a
[74:09] dinosaur talking about this now in 2025
[74:13] because in 2018
[74:16] 17 we were always talking about like
[74:19] like let's let's break this thing like
[74:22] like let's make Bitcoin break like the
[74:26] rules and the the structures that have
[74:28] been put from before and uh but nowadays
[74:33] it's not the the the the main narrative
[74:37] is the main narrative is like number
[74:39] goes up things like that and which I
[74:42] don't like at all. It's like um although
[74:45] I'm I have a I have a strong interest in
[74:49] like following up data on the Bitcoin
[74:52] network, I would love to see Bitcoin
[74:54] becoming more private. I would love to
[74:57] see Bitcoin thriving in a more hostile
[75:00] environment. So that's how transactions
[75:02] and businesses and deals and any kind of
[75:07] financial interaction should be and was
[75:10] for a long time. But now in the last
[75:13] century or so governments have decided
[75:15] that they want to control all all
[75:18] aspects and they do KYC's they do all
[75:22] sorts of like I don't know
[75:25] verifications to what end it's like we
[75:29] still see hacks happening we still see
[75:31] scams happening we still see money
[75:33] laundering happening ask me about it I
[75:36] know I've been monitoring all sorts of
[75:38] stuff like that so it is like it is
[75:41] obvious obvious that it doesn't work. So
[75:42] that's like KYC and things like that.
[75:45] But what it does actually it puts us at
[75:48] a
[75:49] disadvantage us the users like if I want
[75:52] to buy Bitcoin and I need to do KYC for
[75:54] that it's not going to help anything.
[75:57] it's going to make it worse for me
[75:59] because I have provided my information
[76:01] on a server on a website that may be
[76:04] leaked later on and I may get
[76:07] targeted and so I'm putting myself at a
[76:10] huge disadvantage for what for nothing
[76:12] actually. So, but the governments don't
[76:15] think so. And I think that that's not
[76:19] how transactions and financial systems
[76:21] could should work. And I think that
[76:24] Bitcoin will prove that at some point.
[76:27] And it would not go very gentle into
[76:29] that direction because there's going to
[76:31] be all sorts of uh people resisting, all
[76:37] sorts of agencies, other places
[76:39] resisting the fact that Bitcoin may
[76:41] become more private. Bitcoin may go more
[76:45] uh like in the direction of being
[76:48] darknet money rather than uh clear net
[76:52] money like fiat. So that's what I think.
[76:55] So I I think it's going to
[76:57] be and but the thing is it's not going
[77:01] to be the most difficult from Bitcoin's
[77:05] techn technology side. So we just need
[77:09] to just convince the right people to add
[77:12] more private technology on Bitcoin.
[77:14] That's what I think. I love that. Uh
[77:17] absolutely. We we
[77:19] need the number technology sometimes see
[77:22] as a
[77:23] distraction even though I know it's the
[77:26] best marketing tool. It's what gets
[77:28] people
[77:29] in. But if people only care about that
[77:32] and don't get the revolution behind it,
[77:35] they are easily they're easily sellable.
[77:38] They are easily no not sellable buyable.
[77:41] They're easily manipulated. They because
[77:44] if you are for number technology, you
[77:47] love ETFs. You you love strategic
[77:50] Bitcoin reserves. If you like freedom
[77:53] grab technology, you're not in favor of
[77:55] uh you might not been in favor of an
[77:57] ETF. you might not be in favor even of
[77:59] the strategic Bitcoin reserve because it
[78:00] prolongs the life of governments and
[78:03] yeah it's it's it's a it's a wild
[78:07] discussion in in in Bitcoin I think and
[78:10] uh we we we need we need enough freedom
[78:13] fighters so uh Bitcoin doesn't get to be
[78:18] a banker tool but uh a people's tool
[78:23] exactly I I don't want to see Bitcoin
[78:26] becoming something like what gold have
[78:30] become right now at this moment. It's
[78:32] just like you just can't move gold
[78:35] anymore. It's just you you can't just
[78:38] put gold bars in your back and go to
[78:41] whatever you want although it is yours.
[78:44] So there's going to be all sorts of
[78:46] restrictions on that and even probably
[78:49] some penalties and all sorts of things.
[78:52] Just think about this for a moment and I
[78:55] don't want to see this for
[78:57] Bitcoin and Bitcoin I I what I think is
[79:01] that Bitcoin will not become this
[79:03] because the minute it becomes like that
[79:05] or actually the more it becomes like
[79:08] that the more it will
[79:10] show as something that will
[79:14] resist because there's going to be more
[79:17] people because it's it's it's not the
[79:19] it's not the same thing. It's the
[79:21] internet. this digital space. It's
[79:23] there's going to be places that you
[79:25] could do all sorts of stuff to resist
[79:29] this kind of things. It's not just like
[79:31] airports and borders where they could
[79:35] just put their hands on your body and
[79:37] like inspect you and see if you have
[79:39] gold bars with you. So, it's going to be
[79:41] different and it's going to be resisting
[79:43] and more hostile than what people think.
[79:46] So, that's what what I think about it.
[79:50] What a great note to to end the podcast
[79:52] today.
[79:54] Really cool. Uh thank you so much uh Sio
[79:57] for for being on the podcast. Before I
[79:58] let you go, where can people find you
[79:59] and ask you questions? Oh yeah, I'm on
[80:02] Twitter. I al I do have like a YouTube
[80:05] channel podcast and but they're like
[80:07] they're not very active anymore in the
[80:09] last two years or so. I have a Twitter.
[80:11] It's like Z I Y A underline S A D R.
[80:16] That's how it is. You could probably
[80:18] also find me on LinkedIn too. Nowadays,
[80:21] sometimes I go to LinkedIn and uh
[80:26] there's also yeah my Telegram. I have a
[80:29] active Telegram channel with a lot of
[80:31] members. Uh but it's mostly in Persian.
[80:34] So you may not be interested in that,
[80:37] but you just hit me up in Twitter.
[80:40] That's the best place. Really cool.
