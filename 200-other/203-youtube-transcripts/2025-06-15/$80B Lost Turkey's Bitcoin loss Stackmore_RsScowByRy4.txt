[00:00] if they bought Bitcoin instead of gold
[00:02] they would have an excess of $80 billion
[00:05] if they bought 10% Bitcoin and 90% gold
[00:09] they would have an excess of 20 billion
[00:11] I actually use Bitcoin as an measurement
[00:14] for inflation when bitcoin price goes up
[00:16] 100% in a year this is my inflation rate
[00:19] for the Euro for the dollar if you stop
[00:21] pedaling you fall I'm glad we can stack
[00:24] the toshes on such a low level on such a
[00:27] cheap price for every woman in the
[00:29] country if they make 2.1 babies on
[00:32] average the population stays stable and
[00:34] turkey was always over that up until
[00:36] this year this year it's at 1.5 and it's
[00:39] the most significant drop in the world
[00:41] when Michael sailor Stacks he stacks for
[00:43] us too when bu Stacks he also stacks for
[00:46] us so yeah we all work together as a
[00:49] community money printing is taxation
[00:51] Bitcoin is the only true
[00:54] [Music]
[00:56] ownership you live in turkey and turkey
[00:59] is really interesting for me because
[01:00] when you live in Turkey you actually
[01:04] experience a hyper inflation I mean
[01:07] depends on what definition we look at
[01:08] because sometimes they say like hyper
[01:10] inflation is only if we have 50%
[01:12] inflation per month there are some weird
[01:15] definitions of that but if you have in
[01:17] Turkey it's like 75 80% inflation like
[01:19] the official
[01:20] one that's the trick that's the trick
[01:23] and then it's like higher like 100% 120%
[01:26] whatever it is how does this uh impact
[01:30] uh your personal life and maybe how does
[01:32] this even impact personal lives that you
[01:34] see around yourself who don't have
[01:39] Bitcoin so I think this is a good
[01:42] question to begin with so let me start
[01:45] with the official inflation numbers and
[01:47] so there's a group of professors that
[01:50] also calculate the inflation
[01:51] independently and they find it like over
[01:54] 100% and this and that so I mean
[01:57] technically even that's not really
[01:59] realistic because as you know the CPI is
[02:03] faulty by Design so if something is
[02:07] getting more expens when people are
[02:08] consuming it less its weight in the
[02:11] basket of goods decreases so it always
[02:15] has manipulated results like everywhere
[02:17] around the world so uh anyhow for
[02:21] example I want to give this uh specific
[02:24] example so I think it was year
[02:27] 2021 and Volkswagen polar had this uh
[02:31] car 1.2 L
[02:35] uh automatic transmission and it was in
[02:38] the it was in the uh inflation basket as
[02:42] the automotive so that was the car they
[02:45] selected you know what happened that
[02:47] year uh Volkswagen in Turkey brought
[02:51] five or six of those cars only like a
[02:54] very limited amount and it was like I
[02:57] know 3% uh more expensive than
[03:00] 1.0 motor and a manual transmission and
[03:04] everywhere else around the world it was
[03:06] like at least 17 to 20% of price
[03:09] difference literally the government
[03:12] talked to the Volkswagen distributor in
[03:15] Turkey told
[03:17] them that that car will be in the CPI
[03:20] basket and told them not to bring those
[03:23] cars and keep the prices low on that
[03:27] model and this was so [ __ ] because
[03:31] uh that year Volkswagen was thinking of
[03:35] opening up a factory in
[03:37] Turkey they ended up I think opening uh
[03:41] up the factory in Czech Republic czechia
[03:45] uh and I think this may be part of the
[03:48] issue because when you have when you
[03:49] manipulate the price of that car then
[03:52] people don't buy that
[03:55] one they can't even buy that one they
[03:57] buy other seats or other Volkswagen cars
[04:01] but the whole uh sale of their segment B
[04:05] was lowest ever that year so it was a
[04:10] very governmental stupid decision let's
[04:13] say it's it's amazing for me because
[04:16] when you see I actually right now like
[04:20] most of the stuff that I buy is Bitcoin
[04:22] like like I I I buy also my my I also
[04:26] have to pay my bills and stuff like that
[04:28] but most of the stuff that I buy with my
[04:31] things is just Bitcoin so I actually use
[04:35] right now Bitcoin as an measurement for
[04:38] inflation like when bitcoin price goes
[04:40] up 100% in a year this is my inflation
[04:44] rate for the Euro for the dollar and
[04:46] then it's interesting because when you
[04:47] look at the last one year and I just
[04:49] looked up the numbers the last one year
[04:52] for the US Dollars it's like1 n% so a
[04:54] little bit over 100% inflation rate when
[04:57] we count Bitcoin as inflation rate the
[04:59] Turkish lra has almost
[05:02] 180% inflation rate against Bitcoin and
[05:05] I I love taking Bitcoin as the standard
[05:09] as the actual measurement and then
[05:12] measure everything against Bitcoin and
[05:14] then we have like a better inflation a
[05:17] better measurement of the things I mean
[05:20] it's not real inflation I know but
[05:22] inflation you have to measure
[05:23] individually everyone who who buy
[05:25] something but it's a great Anchor Point
[05:27] I feel like yeah is like I mean I think
[05:32] it's not the real good goge at the
[05:34] moment because you know like Fiat is too
[05:38] volatile you know not Bitcoin Fiat is
[05:41] volatile I always say that because
[05:43] Bitcoin is very stable you know that
[05:46] you'll get a block in every 10 minutes
[05:49] approximately you'll get like a I don't
[05:51] know uh mining difficulty change in
[05:55] every
[05:55] 2016 uh blocks 200,000 blocks uh half in
[05:59] reward com so it's very stable and Fiat
[06:02] is not
[06:04] so yeah it's really hard to Gorge that
[06:07] at the moment because yeah they can
[06:10] manipulate Fiat and since they have the
[06:14] media and yeah all the buttons at their
[06:18] power uh it becomes hard to gge with
[06:22] Bitcoin and I know price of Bitcoin is
[06:26] really irrelevant at this
[06:28] moment yeah absolutely and then you're
[06:30] just like you want to have this one
[06:32] asset that you can actually rely on and
[06:34] you really don't care about what the
[06:35] price is like I I'm glad we can stack uh
[06:39] Sates on such a low level on such a
[06:42] cheap price because all of a sudden when
[06:44] it's like a 2,000 300,000 I would also
[06:47] buy it like I would like it does not
[06:50] change my buying Behavior I buy with all
[06:52] the money that I have left over I buy
[06:54] Bitcoin if it's a
[06:56] 10,000 Behavior doesn't
[06:59] absolutely yeah okay I quick question
[07:03] Robin if I switch tabs I want to look at
[07:06] something uh would it disrupt the video
[07:09] by the way or no no it should be fine uh
[07:11] let's let's just try like you can you
[07:13] can switch tabs and and see everything
[07:15] and and I think uh you you should still
[07:17] still be here okay let's test that in
[07:20] action okay so I really want to talk
[07:24] about something about money for example
[07:26] you know when Julio Caesar died or Rome
[07:31] burned down uh yeah the value of their
[07:33] money didn't change because it was a set
[07:36] amount of gold the the coins were but
[07:40] okay this is the tricky part so uh in
[07:44] year uh
[07:46] 1998 August uh the dxy was at 1003 so
[07:52] dxy is a dollar uh you know
[07:55] index and by October it was around 90s
[08:00] okay trick question is do you know what
[08:02] happened during those times between what
[08:05] between the 19 between
[08:07] 1998 uh yeah August and 1998
[08:13] October I have no clue yes so this will
[08:17] be very surprising so literally dxy
[08:19] dropped close to 12% so literally
[08:22] everyone in the world who was holding
[08:24] dollars kind of lost their purchasing
[08:27] power and this happened during the
[08:30] Clinton versus Monica Linsky trials uh
[08:34] which literally was about a [ __ ]
[08:39] so it's so sad that you know like some
[08:43] guys erection or not or
[08:45] whatever could destroy a currency but
[08:49] back in the days when the the ruler the
[08:52] Caesar died nothing happened so this is
[08:55] the state of the money we have right now
[08:58] unfortunately but but wait wait how how
[09:00] did this uh impacted the money that they
[09:03] have had a
[09:04] trial during the trial it literally
[09:07] started dropping because there was loss
[09:09] uh of uh trust to the
[09:12] government to the president because
[09:15] because the trust is not in the currency
[09:17] itself it's in the the leadership in in
[09:20] in the country and the government itself
[09:22] so when they they do something weird all
[09:25] of the sudden also the currency that
[09:28] everyone holds there that makes sense
[09:29] that's that's that's a perspective that
[09:31] I never really covered on the podcast
[09:34] because Bitcoin is
[09:36] so not that many people mention the
[09:39] [ __ ] lead money aka the dollar before
[09:43] but yeah when you think of it it makes
[09:45] sense so also I'll tell you a really
[09:48] good another real good example about the
[09:50] management and the its impact to the
[09:53] money so you know Turkish L is doing
[09:57] really bad against other Fiat currenc is
[09:59] over the last years blah blah blah we
[10:02] have the same guy running the country
[10:04] for over I don't know 22 years now uh at
[10:08] some point he made his son-in-law the
[10:11] Minister of Finance and after that uh
[10:14] the Turkish L literally uh went started
[10:18] to go into a very bad Direction because
[10:22] yeah it was this one guy's decision
[10:24] again making his relative or sonin-law
[10:27] the minister of
[10:30] who has no idea
[10:32] about you know monetary
[10:36] issues and after that yeah we we can't
[10:39] fix it still till till today yeah it it
[10:42] makes a huge huge difference when you
[10:45] have a a money that is packed to actual
[10:48] things like energy with with Bitcoin
[10:51] like maths and energy uh and then
[10:54] there's like currencies that is just
[10:56] packed to the trust of of a government
[11:00] it's amazing to see yeah um the the the
[11:03] entry question that I had is like was
[11:05] like how inflation and and you see it
[11:08] probably in Turkey better than uh than
[11:11] other like still in Austria we have
[11:14] inflation inflation is not not as uh bad
[11:18] as in Turkey but probably you have a
[11:20] better view of of that in in Turkey
[11:23] right now how how do you see inflation
[11:26] influencing personal lives especially
[11:28] those Lives who don't have Bitcoin and
[11:31] who don't hold uh H
[11:34] assets so uh I'll begin with this data
[11:38] point so turkey always had uh fertility
[11:42] rates over 2.1 so if a country has two
[11:47] for every woman in the country uh if
[11:51] they make 2.1 babies on average the
[11:54] population stays stable and turkey was
[11:56] always over that up until this year this
[11:59] year it's at 1.5 and it's the most
[12:02] significant drop in the world now people
[12:05] are afraid to bring babies under these
[12:09] condition so I think that's a very good
[12:11] tell of how things are going that that's
[12:14] uh so like 2 you were always above the
[12:19] 2.1 uh
[12:21] metrix and now you dropped at what was
[12:24] the time frame how how fast did you drop
[12:26] there I know one year
[12:30] last one year was especially I think
[12:33] brutal like because um y uh people uh
[12:39] literally lost a lot of their purchasing
[12:42] power and I know so there's this okay so
[12:47] I'll connect it to this one so I told
[12:50] you the current person is the president
[12:52] for 22 years and at some point we had
[12:57] this other guy uh named deal and he was
[13:01] uh a prime minister for 35 years so
[13:04] actually there's a very funny song that
[13:07] this artist did about the guys
[13:09] presidency it's like a song version of
[13:12] Forest Camp telling the history line
[13:16] about the president back then so this
[13:19] guy I saw a video of him the other day
[13:21] he's talking about
[13:23] inflation and how inflation ruins the
[13:26] moral and ethic values of a Nation and
[13:30] destroys its
[13:31] future it's really good to listen to
[13:34] that you know he's like oh this makes
[13:35] sense you know like wonder what he did
[13:37] to support what his actions were that
[13:39] were supporting it and then you look at
[13:41] it and one time his promise to get
[13:45] elected was I'll decrease the retirement
[13:49] age by 15
[13:52] years so literally which means a lot of
[13:55] retired people getting paid by the
[13:57] government which leads to a good amount
[14:00] of
[14:01] inflation so similarly last year we had
[14:05] elections and before
[14:07] that uh the current government enabled
[14:11] people around 40 years old or so if you
[14:15] had a job in year
[14:18] 2000 you could retire and over 10
[14:21] million people retired this way so that
[14:24] also kind of ruined so now none of the
[14:28] retired people are
[14:30] uh happy because like so many people are
[14:34] retired purchasing power is lost there's
[14:37] like an excess flow of money for a
[14:40] limited amount of goods so everything is
[14:43] getting more
[14:48] expensive it's sad to it's sad to see
[14:50] like they decreased the the average uh
[14:54] uh uh entry in the uh pension system 15
[14:59] years to to what age did they increase
[15:01] 50 or what it was like uh for a limited
[15:04] amount of people back in the days uh
[15:07] suan deal did the guy who was there for
[15:09] 35 years and last year they decreased it
[15:13] for approximately 10 million people if
[15:16] I'm not wrong they lowered it down to 40
[15:20] at age 40 people could retire 40 yes
[15:24] it's called eyt it has a long story I
[15:27] don't know the details but it's it's
[15:30] basically a election bribe you know
[15:33] so I mean for me it's like the the
[15:36] concept of retirement is like yes it's
[15:40] good if people do a job for a long time
[15:43] that they don't like that they can
[15:44] finally retire on that's like a good
[15:46] thing but honestly the better thing is
[15:49] if you find as soon as possible
[15:52] something that you actually enjoy doing
[15:54] and that you actually uh enjoy doing
[15:57] above the reti re age because there's
[16:00] also a lot of great statistics around
[16:03] the starting of retirement a lot of
[16:05] people when they start retirement with
[16:07] like 60 65 70 years old it's not long
[16:11] till uh a lot of medical problems all of
[16:14] the sudden start they never had it
[16:16] before all of the sou medical problems
[16:18] start and uh and I think what was the
[16:21] statistics like uh the average uh years
[16:26] someone spends in retirement is like 8
[16:28] years or something like like after8
[16:30] years of retirement people die on
[16:32] average it's like you you you work so
[16:35] long in a job that did not satisfy you
[16:37] and then after just a few years you
[16:40] die and that's that's a really sad story
[16:43] and so iing a bicycle if you stop
[16:46] pedaling you fall so definitely I I love
[16:50] that analogy a lot yeah that was a
[16:53] really good uh chart study they did with
[16:56] this uh so they sped up the bicycle and
[17:00] they let it run and they drew the charts
[17:04] of the perit
[17:06] followed Yeah so basically they all fall
[17:09] but some fall further some go farther
[17:12] but yeah you need energy you need the
[17:14] proof of work or things
[17:18] Stu yeah and everything especially for
[17:20] the people that go in retirement and
[17:22] they did something that they did not
[17:24] like I would highly suggest to them find
[17:27] something that you really like doing
[17:28] like U my grandpa uh for example was
[17:33] doing a lot of um physical labor with
[17:38] wood like he was a carpenter basically
[17:40] and he did really nice things and he
[17:42] designed it and he was like just hours
[17:44] and hours in in the in the garage and
[17:46] did that and this was really good like
[17:48] this this really kept him going and he
[17:51] still is alive and still keeps going and
[17:53] it's it's it's amazing to see and it's I
[17:56] love to see
[17:59] a weird idea but I would love to see
[18:03] some nonfat work made by him with
[18:07] Bitcoin stuff on it could be could be
[18:10] fun could could yeah be a new Fresh of
[18:13] air for him as
[18:15] well yeah and and I even talked in the M
[18:19] interview M uh was a little bit sharing
[18:23] of his personal side in in my interview
[18:25] with him and I asked him um what what
[18:30] does he has right now that he could not
[18:32] buy with money because he has so much
[18:34] money and he said like a mission and he
[18:37] then go went ahead and said like he was
[18:40] ready to retire he was ready to like
[18:43] step down as a CEO and retire and and
[18:46] leave basically the history and uh cease
[18:49] to exist from the history books uh and
[18:52] then no Bitcoin came along and all of a
[18:54] sudden he got
[18:55] a yeah he he got his youth back and he
[18:58] got his energy back and and that's such
[19:01] such a beautiful thing to see that that
[19:04] all of the sudden people are engaged
[19:06] again and doing something and and
[19:08] getting drive and hope again yeah no you
[19:12] know I love being part of the Bitcoin
[19:15] Community like okay so I wore this
[19:17] t-shirt on purpose so this was
[19:22] 2019 uh January February around that
[19:26] time and HL not who won this amazing
[19:30] Victory against the fake Toshi you
[19:33] know he started this uh yeah lightning
[19:37] chain so he sent uh I think it was
[19:42] 100,000 satoshis to fart face uh 2,000
[19:46] on Twitter and Fartface sent IED 10,000
[19:51] more and sent it to someone else and
[19:53] this went to I don't know over 200
[19:56] people or something so this went around
[19:59] until we reached the limit in the
[20:01] lightning Network because it was like
[20:03] the maximum amount you could send I'm
[20:06] not sure but either it was 2.4 million
[20:10] satoshis or 4.2 million something around
[20:13] that so yeah we sent it to as many
[20:15] people as possible and this was these
[20:18] things bring the community together for
[20:21] example and like yeah that led to a lot
[20:23] of good friendships for me and I know
[20:27] since then I'm like well you know this
[20:30] is pretty cool you could interact with a
[20:32] lot of people do things test stuff like
[20:35] yeah help them do stuff
[20:38] so I just really enjoy this aspect of
[20:42] Bitcoin because it's not a I I don't
[20:46] think it's for me I cannot enjoy it
[20:51] selfishly because I know this if I stack
[20:53] more myself and if I get my female to
[20:56] stack so whenever I stack I end up
[20:58] taking for them too in a way because I
[21:02] take from the supply that's out there
[21:05] the float so I know when Michael sailor
[21:08] Stacks he stacks for us too you know
[21:11] when bu Stacks he also stacks for us so
[21:14] yeah we all work together as a community
[21:18] in a way how is that uh aspect of
[21:21] Bitcoin that we actually like that's
[21:24] that's actually true like if you doing
[21:25] good and you earn more money and you
[21:27] stack more bit that's beneficial for me
[21:30] and all the other bitcoiners the same
[21:32] way is true when when Michel saor is
[21:34] doing something when when other
[21:35] bitcoiners are doing something uh and
[21:38] this community aspect that you just
[21:39] mentioned and the the um benefiting from
[21:43] each other aspect how will this change
[21:46] society I asked that myself so many
[21:48] times and I got different answers to
[21:50] that uh but it's it's it's fascinating
[21:53] for me to see like what will happen on a
[21:56] society that is inclined incentivized to
[22:00] work together against uh versus against
[22:02] each other like right it is right
[22:06] now the problem is that I think we were
[22:09] aligned to work against each other but
[22:12] when you think of it the humanity never
[22:15] developed by okay Wars of course
[22:19] increase technology a lot this and that
[22:22] but what
[22:24] lies be behind the human potential I
[22:27] think is the abil bu to work
[22:30] together so once we can manage to do
[22:33] that it's also part of Game Theory you
[22:36] know like if people are
[22:38] collaborative things flourish so if
[22:41] somebody collaborates and someone else
[22:44] cheats the cheaters grow but once the
[22:48] cheaters uh take over the population the
[22:51] whole population collapses basically
[22:54] so is I want to see more people
[22:56] collaborate with each other and I try to
[22:59] do my best for it as well so I know I
[23:02] try to support all kind of Bitcoin
[23:05] projects like I know for example I saw
[23:09] your podcast on Fountain I use fountain
[23:12] because I support Fountain I support
[23:15] you or I don't know let's say thunder
[23:18] games I love that idea giving Bitcoin to
[23:22] people via games so I try to share it so
[23:26] I see this other company I'm like okay I
[23:28] I think they could work together so I
[23:31] send a message to thunder games I send a
[23:33] message to this other one I'm like oh
[23:34] maybe you should collaborate so I do all
[23:37] this selflessly but at the same time
[23:43] selfly you know I know because I do it
[23:46] selflessly but I know that it will end
[23:48] up benefiting me as well uh it's it's
[23:51] it's very beautiful uh that and the one
[23:55] question that I had in mind before when
[23:57] we talked about Turkey um I feel like in
[24:01] Austria people are not aware of
[24:02] inflation they they sometimes talk about
[24:05] it uh but they are not really aware of
[24:09] of the problem that comes with having
[24:11] this inflation but in in Turkey the
[24:14] inflation is um a bit higher so our
[24:18] people uh especially maybe outside of of
[24:21] your Bitcoin group are people aware of
[24:23] of inflation and the problem and and and
[24:26] what uh this this means for their lives
[24:30] yeah like so right now so it's like you
[24:32] know the classic frog experiment when
[24:34] you throw the Frog inside the boiling
[24:36] water it jumps out and after a while it
[24:38] gets used to it so okay we always had
[24:42] like close to double digit inflation in
[24:44] Turkey but like last couple years it
[24:46] really went to Triple digits maybe and
[24:50] when it initially started to increase uh
[24:53] like that quickly I literally what here
[24:58] 13 14 year old people on the street talk
[25:02] about inflation yeah so now it's less
[25:05] and less because I like everything
[25:08] people get used to it but one good thing
[25:11] is that so I don't know if you know this
[25:13] but um the first coinage was actually in
[25:17] Turkey in this place this country called
[25:20] lyia was the first coinage in the world
[25:23] so maybe you know cus and alates and all
[25:27] those people they were the first ones
[25:29] that standardized coins and made the
[25:32] coin coinage
[25:33] mintage so I always I I kind of
[25:36] sometimes make fun of it we are the
[25:38] grandkids of the people who invented the
[25:41] coinage that have no information about
[25:45] money
[25:49] so but hard assets we were we were
[25:53] talking about turkey is uh a lot of
[25:56] people like gold
[25:58] it's like a traditional
[26:01] stuff and I don't know like for example
[26:04] at weddings and all that stuff people
[26:06] give gold to each other not to each
[26:09] other but to the people who are getting
[26:10] married and that's been a tradition for
[26:13] a long time I try to break it since 2017
[26:16] I'm giving out Bitcoin but I don't know
[26:20] still so few people do it but also a lot
[26:23] of people are into real estate investing
[26:27] and hard assets and the softer the money
[26:31] gets uh nonh hard assets end up becoming
[26:35] hard assets as well for example a lot of
[26:39] people were uh yeah making money by
[26:43] buying and selling cars because you buy
[26:46] a car inflation there's cheap money
[26:49] around and inflation increases and the
[26:53] car becomes more valuable you sell the
[26:55] car and you get a new one so a lot of
[26:57] people used to do that in Turkey because
[27:00] everything was at some point a store of
[27:02] value like you know I could get some
[27:04] detergent and it would become a store of
[27:08] value against the L so is so real estate
[27:12] and gold are the two things that people
[27:15] uh mostly use to protect each other from
[27:17] uh
[27:18] inflation the other day the current
[27:21] president of Turkey actually said uh we
[27:23] are having a hard time to uh so a lot of
[27:27] people
[27:29] have these gold coins and they hold it
[27:32] themselves and the president was
[27:33] complaining that he they are not
[27:35] successful to bring those coins out into
[27:38] the
[27:39] economy because people don't want to
[27:42] they want to yeah have it themselves in
[27:45] their house or in their vault or
[27:47] whatever which is uh a way better way
[27:50] anyways like I I feel like that's that's
[27:53] this is the weird thing of politics when
[27:55] it comes like oh the economy is slowing
[27:57] down then they want to uh increase
[28:01] spending which does nothing like we we
[28:04] need better savings we need a better
[28:07] Foundation of economy that we actually
[28:09] can build capital and that we actually
[28:12] can build companies which then leads to
[28:15] more Prosperity the the the mindset of
[28:18] like oh let's bring everyone to spend
[28:20] their money so we can have a more
[28:23] prosperous uh Society this is like
[28:26] complete nonsense for me
[28:28] yeah you know what else is happening
[28:30] recently in Turkey by the way turkey
[28:32] also uh Central Bank also likes gold so
[28:37] they also buy gold and keep gold in the
[28:39] reserves blah blah blah but recently we
[28:43] have really high interest rates so if
[28:45] you park your money at the bank they pay
[28:47] you I don't know
[28:49] like over 50% a year so a lot of people
[28:55] uh from let's say let's say you you go
[28:58] to your bank and you get a loan from
[29:00] your bank okay and you are paying uh I
[29:04] know 6% interest to the bank in a year
[29:07] so you take that money you bring it to
[29:10] Turkey you put it in a Turkish Bank get
[29:13] the
[29:14] interest uh rate convert it back to
[29:17] euros and yeah get a higher return so
[29:21] this is called the uh carit
[29:23] rate so
[29:26] recently a lot of money is coming to
[29:28] Turkey for car
[29:30] trade and so our reserves are increasing
[29:34] but I think they are buying gold instead
[29:38] of holding the FX reserves and recently
[29:42] I did this
[29:43] calculation uh I took out the last since
[29:47] 2019 the for every quarter they release
[29:51] how much gold the Central Bank bought or
[29:54] sold so I took all those numbers and I C
[29:58] calculated let's say if they bought
[30:01] Bitcoin instead of gold they would have
[30:03] an excess of 80 billion dollars if they
[30:08] bought 10% Bitcoin and 90% gold they
[30:11] would have I know an excess of $ 20
[30:14] billion or something so was very
[30:17] interesting and of course I tweeted out
[30:19] to
[30:20] the uh Minister of Finance but of course
[30:24] it was just for fun I don't think he'll
[30:26] take it seriously anyways he is
[30:28] currently focusing on taxing the [ __ ]
[30:30] out of
[30:31] everything
[30:33] so he he he wants to get money uh so he
[30:36] wants to tax everything no it's crazy
[30:39] like the other day I think he suggested
[30:42] that uh so you're a waiter at a place
[30:45] let's say and you get a tip he asked
[30:47] that 10% of the tip to be
[30:51] taxed which is new you
[30:53] know the tips t taxing the tips it's
[30:58] that's crazy yeah I know I also read
[31:02] today
[31:04] that uh the number of traffic fines that
[31:08] people get for
[31:09] driving a red light or whatever you know
[31:12] speeding Etc it increased six times
[31:16] compared to the same season of last year
[31:19] so they are literally finding people
[31:22] extra they are adding more
[31:25] taxes yeah it's interesting ing times
[31:28] wait wait what was this uh so people get
[31:31] more fined for traffic uh fin or there
[31:34] are more controls and more fins and oh
[31:38] yeah last year I think it was in March
[31:43] up until March it was I know 1 million
[31:46] fines and this year up until March it
[31:49] was like 5 million something it's a lot
[31:52] I just looked it up uh in Austria
[31:55] actually tips are also taxed as I see it
[31:58] I never knew it so like even if you go
[32:01] to wait a wait just a small tip they
[32:04] have to pay taxes on that okay in Turkey
[32:07] it wasn't the case though like so but
[32:10] it's crazy like I it should not be there
[32:13] is there tax that uh like uh is there
[32:16] taxes that you think would make sense or
[32:19] is is is taxes um a bad Concept in
[32:23] general I mean technically uh wheny
[32:27] printing is tax
[32:28] ation and we already do it enough so
[32:31] there was a list of I know tax
[32:34] percentages in different countries
[32:36] across o eecd countries and turkey was
[32:40] at the low part of the scale so like
[32:42] there was Bulgaria which was which had
[32:44] very low taxes and Germany was high blah
[32:47] blah blah Austria was high turkey was
[32:50] low but when you take the infl the money
[32:54] printing into account turkey has the
[32:57] high highest taxation among all the oecd
[33:01] countries like it's it's higher than
[33:02] Norway it's higher than
[33:04] Finland but nobody considers it that
[33:08] way how aware are people in in Turkey
[33:12] about Bitcoin uh well you know when
[33:15] money gets low quality people cut
[33:17] Corners
[33:19] more in even in doing their business
[33:22] like you see more Shar inflation you see
[33:25] and Shar inflation is not just the you
[33:27] know lower sizes but also lower quality
[33:30] even in construction like I know
[33:33] Constructors still put less cement than
[33:36] they are supposed to do blah blah blah
[33:39] you know and I think the same applies
[33:41] with Bitcoin because people think they
[33:44] will cut Corners by buying shitcoins and
[33:49] it doesn't happen so like Bitcoin is I
[33:52] think slowly getting more understood uh
[33:55] like we have a good group it's growing
[33:58] slowly but yeah we have a very solid
[34:00] group uh it's a spinoff Aron
[34:04] zanik uh I think the ours is which means
[34:09] 21 in Turkish I think it was the first
[34:12] International spin-off of iOS vanik and
[34:16] yeah we are supporting each other
[34:19] meeting up occasionally that group is
[34:24] yeah uh has really good Bitcoin but the
[34:28] most of the population is into whatever
[34:31] coin that's hype at the moment you
[34:35] know like Let It Be Pepe Let It Be shba
[34:39] or whatever you know whatever is
[34:41] hype and the sad thing is like this this
[34:44] inflation will come in every part of the
[34:47] world yeah yes I always say we are front
[34:50] running so Venezuela is front running
[34:54] Lebanon Lebanon is front running turkey
[34:56] turkey is front running let's say France
[34:58] France is front running Austria Austria
[35:01] is front running Switzerland Switzerland
[35:04] is front running USA so whever has Fiat
[35:08] it will happen
[35:10] it's
[35:12] inevitable do you see Fiat going away
[35:16] I human stupidity is not going away so
[35:20] probably Fiat will stay there some time
[35:23] too thank you you already made it
[35:26] halfway through the video and I'm really
[35:28] really grateful to have you here two
[35:30] things make this channel possible you as
[35:32] a watcher and listener who keep
[35:34] supporting this Channel and another one
[35:37] is all the Bitcoin brands that I partner
[35:39] up with like 21 Bitcoin who support me
[35:42] from the very start and where I
[35:43] personally buy my Bitcoin from with code
[35:45] Robin you even get a discount when you
[35:47] buy Bitcoin with them and now also
[35:50] bitbox bitbox is the simplest and
[35:52] securest way to secure your Bitcoin and
[35:55] I heard a crazy statistics only 2% of
[35:58] bitcoiners hold their Bitcoin in a
[36:00] hardware wallet how crazy is that don't
[36:02] be in that 98% bracket be in the 2%
[36:06] bracket and if you have self- custody
[36:08] and you know your friend does not have
[36:10] maybe he needs a Christmas present maybe
[36:12] he needs a birth present and a small
[36:14] life hack if you use code Robin you get
[36:16] 5% off your order plus you support my
[36:20] channel and now let's get back to the
[36:22] video I also I also think that we will
[36:24] have to live with feeld for a long time
[36:27] uh maybe maybe my whole lifetime let's
[36:31] see and maybe even beyond that long time
[36:34] is that you and I for example don't live
[36:37] on Fiat really it's a for me it's just a
[36:40] tool of
[36:41] exchange like and you know this Michael
[36:45] Goldstein the bit Stein on
[36:49] Twitter no no was it yes it was his
[36:52] article it's like everyone is a scammer
[36:55] I sometimes feel like a scammer when
[36:57] people accept Fiat for my stuff you
[37:00] know like once you know how Superior
[37:03] Bitcoin is paying someone in Fiat is
[37:05] like I scammed him again you know he
[37:08] accepted my [ __ ] fat
[37:12] so that's that's an interesting
[37:15] perspective yeah and you also uh told me
[37:19] before that you want to talk about you
[37:20] you tried to Orange Bill a big Austrian
[37:23] investment firm yes it's this group
[37:27] called
[37:28] princeon uh and I know it was like I
[37:32] think it was the time where uh the New
[37:36] Year party of
[37:39] 2019 I met a FR friend who worked at
[37:42] this company called princeon and he was
[37:45] like in the Investments Division and I
[37:48] tried to orange pill him I even talk to
[37:50] sa and I'm like well if this company is
[37:54] looking to get orange pilled would you
[37:56] go and yeah like do a seminar and teach
[37:59] them he was yeah sure I can do that but
[38:03] they missed that opportunity so you know
[38:06] Corona happened and a year later
[38:10] the uh oil prices went to negative and
[38:14] this company was long uh oil
[38:19] commodity so technically I know that
[38:23] they were potent potentially losing a
[38:25] lot of money so once I saw this news I
[38:28] wrote to this guy and I'm like well
[38:30] remember Bitcoin I think you were very
[38:32] big on oil and oil is going negative
[38:35] this could be your SK PCH he's like ah
[38:38] we got some information before we got
[38:40] rid of the oil contracts blah blah blah
[38:42] whatever you know and this year I tried
[38:47] again because there was the ETF launch
[38:49] and may maybe they'll go like the ETF
[38:51] route or whatever you know and he's like
[38:53] no it's too expensive
[38:56] and and you know normally third time has
[38:59] the charm but I think they need like a
[39:01] fourth time or something who
[39:04] knows it's uh this argument that Bitcoin
[39:07] is too expensive it's so dumb on so many
[39:13] levels
[39:15] yes I see it like when when people are
[39:18] talking about that it's like they only
[39:20] see the unit price which does not matter
[39:22] at all you have to look at the whole
[39:24] thing how much uh Market valuation is
[39:27] already India how much uh like how big
[39:30] is Bitcoin and how big can it be uh and
[39:34] this is then see people saying oh no
[39:36] it's too expensive it's 70,000 it's like
[39:39] one no but I always say like imagine
[39:43] every Bitcoin every millionaire wants
[39:45] one Bitcoin it's not possible because
[39:47] they're like three times as many bit
[39:49] millionaires than there are bitcoins no
[39:51] the also millionaires like
[39:53] inflate a lot too you know
[39:57] I think if in year
[40:01] 2019 there were like I know 20 million
[40:04] less millionair in the world you know so
[40:08] I don't know I'm not sure of the number
[40:10] but it they they inflate a lot like
[40:13] because money is abundant and you know
[40:15] it's worthless anyway so inflation makes
[40:19] us all millionaires
[40:23] yes I used to be a billionaire so in 20
[40:27] 6 uh turkey got rid of six zeros out of
[40:31] its money so let's say uh right now 32
[40:36] uh lasas Turkish lasas is
[40:39] $1 uh if we didn't get rid of the six
[40:41] zeros it would be 32 million
[40:44] L were
[40:46] $1 so yeah in 2006 everybody in Turkey
[40:50] was a millionaire SL billionaire
[40:52] whatever but and they yeah deleted six
[40:57] zeros I think if it continues like this
[41:00] we'll probably delete another zero in
[41:01] the next couple of years it's it's I
[41:05] can't believe that people still trust in
[41:07] this yeah you know what so funny so
[41:12] I uh okay so let's say uh the government
[41:18] is doing some investment in a city or
[41:20] something when they talk about it they
[41:22] say okay we invested couple trillion L
[41:27] into this so they use the old money when
[41:30] talking about the Investments they did
[41:32] but for example there's a budget deficit
[41:34] and when they mention it they talk with
[41:36] the new
[41:38] money
[41:40] so you know the funny thing is that this
[41:44] happened up until 2019 but for some
[41:47] reason in 2019 they stopped it I don't
[41:50] know what happened maybe somebody
[41:52] started making fun of them or something
[41:54] but this is just so funny have they mess
[41:57] up people's mind and that's why
[41:59] education is so important and I love
[42:01] that you have a website think something
[42:04] with Bitcoin only and I saw it quickly
[42:06] and there was really cool not my website
[42:09] by the way I just like website so I
[42:13] shared it there yeah it's it's it's it's
[42:16] a really good one I like it a lot they
[42:18] have like all the materials there they
[42:20] have all the directors there whatever
[42:22] you want to do you just think go there
[42:25] you can like oh I want to hear podcast a
[42:27] podcast or uh I want to have a job then
[42:30] you get directed to jobs and whatever
[42:32] you want to do you can directly go there
[42:35] I love the website that you link it I
[42:37] thought it's it's yours but yeah mistak
[42:40] yeah no I I just like it I want I'm
[42:44] happy if more people sees it so I put it
[42:46] up there definitely do you know who who
[42:51] who made
[42:53] it I know I knew but I don't I follow so
[42:58] many bitcoiners I don't care if I follow
[43:00] thousands if somebody is in Bitcoin and
[43:04] they do stuff I follow them and this was
[43:07] a very old uh follow that I did I don't
[43:12] know at the moment but maybe it's listed
[43:14] on the website somewhere yeah I didn't
[43:16] look closely but yeah probably it's
[43:18] listed
[43:19] yeah I'm sorry to the uh person who
[43:24] maintains that website I I'm not sure
[43:26] who you are at at the moment h no
[43:28] problem we we could write it in the in
[43:31] the description when I see it I will I
[43:32] will write in there um yeah it's it's a
[43:34] good website I love it a lot because it
[43:36] gives like an overview of everything and
[43:39] I actually had this thought in mind that
[43:40] I also want to do something similar than
[43:42] that uh like I think a year ago but
[43:45] there's also something else coming up I
[43:47] was like oh let's first build the
[43:49] Twitter let's first build the podcast
[43:50] let's first build all the other stuff uh
[43:52] but I still might do it uh like just
[43:54] making a website where I can like hey
[43:57] hey you want to learn about Bitcoin go
[44:00] there I like that a lot would you do it
[44:03] in English or in yeah for austrians uh
[44:08] only English I I do it uh I think there
[44:11] are a lot of great materials in in in in
[44:14] Austria already in in in German language
[44:17] there also there's also a lot of great
[44:19] material in uh in English but I'm more
[44:24] English guy my girlfriend speaks English
[44:26] with me uh mostly of the time I speak
[44:29] with my friends English even so like I
[44:31] think 90% of my time spent speaking is
[44:36] and especially also consuming uh is look
[44:39] like I think 90% of my time spent
[44:42] speaking with other people is English
[44:45] and 100% of the time consuming stuff is
[44:47] English like I I rarely watch anything
[44:50] in German or something like that yeah
[44:53] that's the kind of a problem by the way
[44:55] why on why uh turkey is not really
[44:58] Bitcoin IED because there's a language
[45:01] barrier uh and you know like people are
[45:04] dependent
[45:06] on third parties like people who
[45:08] translate stuff or like you know uh yeah
[45:12] so usually the narratives
[45:14] are I think uh generated in
[45:18] English so if you have access to English
[45:21] you get firstand
[45:23] information and if not you get uh the
[45:27] information over a third party and yeah
[45:31] H so with the Bitcoin stuff like a lot
[45:34] of Turkish people
[45:37] uh Who start talking about Bitcoin go
[45:40] into the shitcoin routes because the
[45:43] meme coins altcoins whatever they pay
[45:45] them generously since they are companies
[45:49] they have marketing budgets and all that
[45:51] stuff
[45:52] so this is a a problem I think for the
[45:57] Turkish people they are gu the guides
[45:59] are blind yeah so you have to make more
[46:03] Turkish content then yeah we we try to
[46:07] do like time to time uh I don't know
[46:10] maybe you know pretty
[46:13] Flo he is responsible of adopting
[46:16] Bitcoin conferences uh yeah so he's also
[46:20] Turkish and sometimes he has these
[46:22] bounties for our young bitcoiner friends
[46:25] to translate the Artic go into Turkish
[46:28] and this and that so it's
[46:31] helpful we we need more education that's
[46:33] like so important uh to have education
[46:36] everywhere in the world in the local
[46:38] language I mean at some point I feel
[46:41] like everything will be translated by
[46:43] eii and it will not matter that much but
[46:45] it's hard to say if this future is in
[46:47] one two years or seven eight years uh or
[46:51] 15 20 I have no clue like I thought it's
[46:54] already here at this point so
[46:57] Tak longer than effort you know uh let's
[47:01] talk about AI stuff a little bit you
[47:04] know recently this Michael D uh Michael
[47:07] D tweeted about Bitcoin and scarcity and
[47:10] all that stuff I think a little BS
[47:13] behind it is that you know they are
[47:16] setting up this new uh AI Center for
[47:19] Twitter Twitter's Gro uh that D is doing
[47:23] that so I'm sure that they were yeah
[47:27] together with Nvidia and I'm sure that
[47:29] they paid a lot of money for nvidia's
[47:31] chips because they are currently scarce
[47:35] because you know there's an imbalance
[47:38] between the demand and you know the
[47:41] production there's an imbalance so I
[47:43] know it cost like 3,000 something
[47:46] dollars to produce an h100 chip and they
[47:49] sell it up to
[47:52] $40,000 so there's a scarc there but
[47:55] it's not like real scarc is like a
[47:57] temporary scarcity or something so I'm
[48:00] sure that it kind of helps PE someone
[48:03] understand that absolute scarcity is
[48:06] much much much more valuable than these
[48:10] regulatory or you know
[48:14] production based scarcities yeah I I
[48:17] think the Michael saor just talked to
[48:20] Michael D yeah
[48:23] probably I think it's not yeah
[48:27] uh was it after your uh interview with
[48:30] sailor or before after after like I had
[48:34] the
[48:34] interview I think in in Bitcoin prog so
[48:37] it's now uh a week ago and this was
[48:40] coming up like this week so this was
[48:44] after
[48:45] that that's interesting yeah I wish I
[48:48] was in prag like I love going to bitcoin
[48:50] conferences it's amazing but I'm really
[48:54] too lazy to get a we have to get visas
[48:58] to European Union countries and I really
[49:02] hate begging for that permission because
[49:04] I'm like I want to go to your country I
[49:06] want to spend some time and some money
[49:09] there and I'm begging for that so it's
[49:12] like so annoying it's how hard is it to
[49:15] to get the visa it's not hard I had like
[49:18] long visas because I used to work with a
[49:21] German company so and like you get a
[49:24] shangan Visa you can visit all the EU
[49:27] Union country European Union countries
[49:30] but you need to apply for it and they
[49:32] need to give you a date and the date is
[49:35] a little farther away and I'm like H I
[49:38] don't want to deal with that so instead
[49:40] I rather go to El Salvador or some other
[49:43] place like will do you think that
[49:45] Bitcoin could even eliminate those those
[49:47] borers to a certain extent which one do
[49:51] do you think that Bitcoin could uh
[49:53] eliminate those uh physical restrictions
[49:57] of borders when we all have the same
[49:59] money and we don't have to because a lot
[50:01] of the military use I think is to
[50:03] protect their own currency right now
[50:05] yeah yeah uh and if everyone has Bitcoin
[50:08] as their own currency I think military
[50:10] use will be completely changed it will
[50:13] not go away but it will be completely
[50:15] changed and maybe this could um lead to
[50:20] way more open
[50:22] world yeah so I don't know I I had this
[50:26] thread before Jason Lowry was like big
[50:30] on the soft War stuff so yeah
[50:34] basically the military is there to
[50:36] protect the borders and blah blah blah
[50:39] and
[50:40] like I know the money is taxes are
[50:44] collected to protect the borders and
[50:46] this and that so yeah it's like a big
[50:49] complex uh issue but I think if
[50:54] ownership is guaranteed
[50:57] by n and everyone else like like in
[51:02] Bitcoin and only in Bitcoin other
[51:05] ownerships are not like finalized or
[51:07] guaranteed in my opinion Bitcoin is the
[51:10] the only true
[51:11] ownership and once people more people
[51:14] understand it it will become bigger and
[51:18] like let's say I in the future people
[51:21] can buy let's say a house for 100,000
[51:24] satosi or whatever so
[51:27] Mobility will be much more important and
[51:29] I think yeah permissions will decrease
[51:33] and borders will decrease but it will
[51:35] take a long time because no government
[51:38] wants to give away that
[51:40] power
[51:41] so it it it will take uh it will take
[51:45] some some sometimes there yeah probably
[51:47] a very long time but absolutely perfect
[51:51] but I personally want to spend my time
[51:53] and money in places
[51:56] like like a single issue water in places
[52:00] that support
[52:01] Bitcoin you
[52:03] know I want to go to Surinam for example
[52:06] because this Maya is working there to
[52:09] become the president of Surinam and it's
[52:12] pretty cool so I know or other places
[52:17] like Uganda is interesting they have
[52:19] this orphanage with over 100 kids that
[52:23] they are taking care of and they except
[52:25] Bitcoin donations they give Bitcoin
[52:27] classes and I know you can do gorilla
[52:31] tours uh with Bitcoin and yeah I would
[52:34] love to spend my time and effort there
[52:37] so instead of I know yeah it's it's it's
[52:40] fascinating to see the different
[52:42] counters adopting it and and the G game
[52:44] Fe playing out um let's come closer to
[52:47] the end routine of our podcast and I ask
[52:49] these questions now every time in the
[52:51] podcast uh and I'm really passionate
[52:54] about it to to learn from other
[52:56] bitcoiners and give them the stage to
[52:58] learn from each other um what are you
[53:00] currently uh passionate about or
[53:02] learning deeply about besides Bitcoin H
[53:06] besides Bitcoin well so um I'm I I'm
[53:11] really not like someone who loves uh
[53:13] specializing on things so I look at
[53:17] different things all the time I know
[53:19] like at this time I'm kind of I know
[53:23] looking on robotics yeah because I know
[53:26] I start working with my old company
[53:29] again and they have these new products
[53:30] for Robotics and I know like part of the
[53:34] job will be like to find startups and
[53:36] Supply them these special gearboxes free
[53:39] of charge so they get a beginning and
[53:42] all that stuff so it's interesting in my
[53:44] opinion so humanid robots and all that
[53:48] stuff so last couple weeks I started to
[53:51] focus on that and I'm also like I I do
[53:56] compost ing machine so I'm also doing
[53:58] different researches on that because I
[54:01] know we started to compost make machines
[54:04] to compost uh dead
[54:07] people so I'm experimenting with
[54:10] some yeah it's interesting stuff so
[54:14] I'm experimenting on composting
[54:18] deceased people and not not not
[54:22] personally experimenting don't get me
[54:25] wrong but on pets and yeah all that
[54:28] stuff so that's an interesting topic for
[54:30] me looking for I know different enzymes
[54:33] and bacterias and all that stuff so
[54:36] that's an very interesting topic really
[54:40] cool thanks for sharing this with us and
[54:42] we have Andro te also in the podcast
[54:44] where the previous guest is asking a
[54:45] question for the next guest without
[54:46] knowing who the next guest actually is
[54:49] uh and the question for you from the
[54:50] previous guest is if you could travel in
[54:53] time would you go back in time to 29 so
[54:58] you could buy or mine more Bitcoin or
[55:01] would you go forward in time to 20 45 to
[55:06] see how Bitcoin succeeded I no I rather
[55:09] stay in this time actually because first
[55:13] of all you know how they say everyone uh
[55:17] gets Bitcoin at the price they
[55:20] deserve since this is an absolutely
[55:23] scarce asset I mean of course there's
[55:25] not AB good
[55:26] be changes if we all agree on the number
[55:30] of coins or whatever in the future there
[55:31] could be changes whatever but in
[55:34] absolutely uh scar things I say I'm only
[55:39] destined to hold as many sets as I'm
[55:42] yeah destined to
[55:44] hold because like with money everyone
[55:48] can be a millionaire you know but it
[55:51] becomes harder and harder to become to
[55:54] have 100,000 Bitcoins you know know so I
[55:58] don't know I I think it's not like more
[56:00] than deserve you are destined to custody
[56:04] the a certain amount of sets that's how
[56:06] I feel
[56:07] so I just want to see how it plays
[56:11] out amazing I love it and and it's it's
[56:14] like staying in the moment and staying
[56:16] present is is is is the better move I
[56:19] feel like too um perfect then yeah thank
