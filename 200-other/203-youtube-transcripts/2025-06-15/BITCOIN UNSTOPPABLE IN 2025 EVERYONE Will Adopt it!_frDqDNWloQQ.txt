[00:00] Bitcoin is just accelerating this
[00:02] movement that people move wherever it
[00:04] fits them best but it also forces
[00:06] governments to rethink their policies
[00:08] people smell the the critical mass of
[00:10] bitcoiners the critical thinking and
[00:12] their willingness to move wherever it
[00:14] fits them best and this is of course a
[00:16] non-ignorable political force now as
[00:19] well we have been trained into this
[00:20] belief that policy leads people it has
[00:23] never been this way people lead policy
[00:26] and by extension politic if I have
[00:28] Bitcoin there is a certain invincibility
[00:31] that comes with it and now suddenly I
[00:33] don't have to chase the politician but
[00:35] politician has to chase me there is no
[00:37] way that Bitcoin does not generate these
[00:39] societally positive nature positive
[00:42] climate positive outcomes in 2008 the
[00:45] societal contract between those
[00:47] institutions and the people has been
[00:48] broken Capital senses change much
[00:51] quicker because change is often very
[00:54] tcid very immaterial something diffus
[00:57] but Capital usually sees it in profits
[01:00] spreads and margins sooner or later
[01:03] Bitcoin will anyways come to you in
[01:05] Bitcoin rewards you on an idea basis it
[01:08] rewards you for the patience and the
[01:11] endurance and the resilience that you
[01:13] [Music]
[01:17] had thanks for having me warm greetings
[01:19] from zri zui yeah Switzerland is kind of
[01:22] the the it's it's one of the Bitcoin
[01:26] hubs for me in uh Europe I think
[01:29] Switzerland
[01:30] has if you're a bitcoiner Switzerland
[01:33] should be on your map to move there if
[01:36] your country is bad to to you
[01:39] politically that's what I always said
[01:41] you know I'm Austrian by origin myself
[01:44] so I've been living in Switzerland now
[01:45] for oh my God 25 years um and
[01:50] Switzerland grows on someone and I think
[01:52] especially if you're a Bitcoin and if
[01:54] you're interested in in bottomup
[01:58] democracies I would call it um
[02:00] Switzerland is the perfect place and I
[02:02] think it's a it's a natural match you
[02:03] have a neutral country that should adapt
[02:06] the most neutral currency so I think we
[02:08] see we will see a lot of really really
[02:10] good news coming out of Switzerland and
[02:13] there are amazing people here and like
[02:15] typically Swiss they are not like
[02:17] massively on the radar uh on the
[02:19] international radar uh but there's a lot
[02:22] of work going on in the
[02:24] background um so it's it's more a
[02:26] philosophy of don't tell till it's done
[02:29] um but I can assure you there's a lot of
[02:32] networking a lot of good momentum both
[02:35] on the institutional adoption side in
[02:37] terms of of what is bitcoin as money but
[02:40] also on the infrastructure side what can
[02:42] Bitcoin mining achieve for societal
[02:45] Prosperity I think it could be an
[02:47] interesting topic for us also to discuss
[02:49] because we when we talk about Bitcoin we
[02:51] talk a lot about El Salvador we talk a
[02:53] lot about the us this year because of
[02:55] the election and Trump being on the
[02:58] conferences but we don't talk that much
[03:01] how is actually in Europe uh Bitcoin
[03:04] going and how what what are the the
[03:07] consequences of Bitcoin right now in in
[03:10] in in Europe in with Bitcoin how do you
[03:13] see Europe being towards Bitcoin right
[03:16] now um are you scared for the future
[03:20] that they might do something bad to them
[03:22] or how do you see it yeah it's indeed a
[03:26] very interesting angle I think there are
[03:27] different perspectives to it and um Let
[03:30] me let me start with the El Salvador and
[03:32] US piece and I think every country has
[03:36] its Merit in the in the in the Bitcoin
[03:39] conversation I think every every country
[03:41] comes from a different place El Salvador
[03:44] comes from a place of societal despair
[03:47] you would call it um the US comes from a
[03:50] comes from a position of of incredible
[03:53] power and thriving to EST or manifest
[03:56] that power for for a very long time and
[03:59] as I said I mean Switzerland comes also
[04:01] with a with a with a with a history that
[04:04] makes it more or less prone to be a
[04:06] Bitcoin nation and I think one of which
[04:08] is clearly the if you look into the
[04:11] history of of of Switzerland in itself
[04:14] it it it's a it's a federal state that
[04:17] grew um That Grew
[04:19] consecutively uh to the size that it
[04:21] currently is it's a very young Nation uh
[04:24] but it's a very proud nation in terms of
[04:26] uh civil liberties um neutrality the um
[04:31] societal participation societal
[04:33] discourse and I think that those are
[04:36] values that that we typically also share
[04:38] in the Bitcoin space so there's sort of
[04:41] a natural fit going on and and I think
[04:43] what went a bit under the radar is that
[04:46] as the SNB the Swiss National Bank is a
[04:49] publicly traded institution uh it also
[04:52] holds General assemblies which are
[04:53] broadcasted and a couple of years ago
[04:56] someone with a very low follow account
[04:59] assign EV um asked to speak there and he
[05:02] gave a firing two and a half minute
[05:04] speech for uh the mo Switzerland as the
[05:07] most neutral country uh historically
[05:10] should adapt um the most neutral
[05:13] currency so that the idea of a strategic
[05:15] Reserve is actually much older um uh as
[05:18] an idea um than than just as it
[05:21] originated now in the in the in the US
[05:24] conversation so I find that very
[05:26] interesting and you see that people are
[05:30] very tech savvy very very Progressive
[05:33] when it comes to these to these to these
[05:35] instruments that will help to capture
[05:37] societal value and spread societal
[05:40] Prosperity so you see it in the uh in
[05:43] the in in the in the society-wide
[05:45] adoption uh rate Switzerland ranks
[05:47] really really high up um I think not as
[05:50] far as far up as Austria actually by the
[05:52] way which always surprises me um but you
[05:56] see a lot of a lot of movement there and
[05:59] and it Bitcoin slowly makes its way into
[06:02] the societal discourse uh with all ups
[06:05] and downs of course um so I'm very
[06:08] bullish on on Switzerland because I
[06:10] think the idea here is more to to
[06:13] manifest the the idea of the of the
[06:16] national sovereignity uh Independence
[06:18] and neutrality which is a very powerful
[06:21] angle that resonates with people so I'm
[06:23] really curious to see how this will will
[06:25] develop in the future and in the near
[06:28] future though very very happy that I'm
[06:30] here and I'm able to participate in this
[06:32] conversation to your second question
[06:35] Europe is a difficult place and I think
[06:36] you can answer that question from from
[06:38] different angles if you look at it from
[06:41] a European angle purely um I think it's
[06:44] a desperate situation it's a dire
[06:47] situation but it only sort of
[06:50] um it's it's one in many there's a long
[06:53] row of dire decisions and and and um uh
[06:59] um what's the word for it what the word
[07:01] I'm looking for um Dia is probably the
[07:04] the right word for it but I think um the
[07:07] European idea has been sort of hijacked
[07:11] by bureaucrats and I think this is a
[07:13] very dangerous um uh development uh we
[07:18] should be very aware of that but it's
[07:20] not only uh the the attack angle towards
[07:22] Bitcoin it's the attack angle towards
[07:25] freedom of speech um chat surveillance
[07:29] uh um uh Stupid Tech uh regulations that
[07:35] stifle Innovation um and there there's a
[07:38] lot of of of um unfortunate regulation
[07:41] going on Bitcoin mining is the least of
[07:44] European problems but it's sort of
[07:47] intertwined with one of the biggest um
[07:50] European problems that we have namely
[07:52] the energy security um angle and and the
[07:57] the the the the necessary
[08:00] very condition for Prosperity that we
[08:02] have cheap and abundant energy uh where
[08:06] Europe obviously has its own history of
[08:09] how the cheap and abundant has been has
[08:11] been established which is now
[08:14] jeopardized through through the Russian
[08:15] European uh sorry the Russian uh
[08:18] Ukrainian conflict and I think
[08:20] Switzerland cannot isolate itself from
[08:23] that conversation um obviously
[08:25] Switzerland is or the European Union is
[08:28] Switzerland largest trading partner by
[08:31] far we are surrounded by I think seven
[08:34] European countries um there is a high
[08:38] degree of
[08:39] interdependencies
[08:41] politically uh through Legacy Frameworks
[08:44] and international contract but also very
[08:47] physically on on on the on the trade
[08:50] side of things not only for goods but
[08:52] also for energy so I think nobody should
[08:56] be fooled when someone says we don't
[08:59] care here in Switzerland what uh Europe
[09:02] experiences because um Switzerland's
[09:05] Destiny is hugely intertwined with the
[09:08] European Destiny so in that sense I
[09:11] would I would I would recommend us to to
[09:15] lead by example as as Switzerland but
[09:18] also take positive influence in by
[09:21] showcasing what can be done how uh a
[09:25] positive transition can be accomplished
[09:27] and hopefully spread the word and starts
[09:30] to influence um also po uh European
[09:34] policy makers and I think the past
[09:36] couple of weeks have been super
[09:37] interesting in that regard because I
[09:39] remember a month ago approximately uh
[09:43] one of the uh of the of the um um States
[09:47] here in Switzerland has U forced a
[09:50] notion or the parliament of the state
[09:51] has forced a notion to study Bitcoin
[09:53] mining and its role in Grid
[09:55] stabilization and renewable buildout
[09:58] which is an incredibly and impressive U
[10:01] ambition um and we see these sparkks now
[10:05] sort of flipping over to to the European
[10:07] continent as well uh or to the European
[10:10] political continent uh that people just
[10:13] pick up on it and I think these stories
[10:15] matter and the closer these stories are
[10:17] to your country to where you live the
[10:21] better they are you know for us as
[10:22] Europeans we see we listen to the
[10:25] stories from El Salvador but it's a a
[10:27] little bit difficult to relate to that
[10:30] and as a European I think it's easier to
[10:33] to relate to a Swiss story or for a
[10:35] Swiss person it's easier to relate to
[10:37] European story so in that sense I don't
[10:40] think that we can sort of dissect each
[10:43] other uh we're one continent we are so
[10:46] heavily intertwined in everything that
[10:47] we do and um but that also means that
[10:51] the solutions are intertwined as well so
[10:55] uh leading by example within the
[10:56] autonomy that countries individually
[10:58] have where of course Switzerland has
[11:01] more um political autonomy than the
[11:04] other European countries that are within
[11:06] the
[11:07] eu27 uh but then again you know over the
[11:10] long run we need to spread this to every
[11:13] country um on the planet I think it's
[11:17] it's great I I I'm I'm aware of uh that
[11:20] we have a lot of uh uh us and also
[11:23] Indians and Australians listeners uh and
[11:27] and uh and Watchers here I just want to
[11:29] pull that up for for people to
[11:31] understand what what you talked about
[11:33] that here Switzerland right in the
[11:35] middle and we have all those European
[11:37] Union so like EU uh States uh basically
[11:42] circling in on on
[11:44] Switzerland uh because like the other
[11:46] states like uh Britain and they are like
[11:48] a little bit have more breathing room
[11:51] and Switzerland is basically really
[11:53] within a European Union uh Circle but
[11:56] they're not in the European Union so uh
[11:59] that that's a really interesting
[12:00] situation do you see any chance
[12:03] actually within the Swiss population
[12:06] that they vote for uh a joining of the
[12:10] European Union it's an interesting one
[12:12] um historically the Swiss have been
[12:15] asked if they were if they wanted to
[12:17] join um the European Union and maybe to
[12:21] add a little bit of of color to what you
[12:23] just said um Switzerland is also not a
[12:25] homogeneous country it's by no means uh
[12:28] there are four
[12:30] national
[12:31] languages uh we talk German we talk
[12:34] French uh we talk Italian in the South
[12:37] and there's a fourth um ancient um
[12:40] almost dialect language which is called
[12:42] Rachel Romanian um that uh nobody
[12:46] understands because it's so old and not
[12:48] related to any other of the languages
[12:50] and so there are four four languages um
[12:53] and and and they are politically also
[12:55] traditionally a bit in divide so uh the
[12:58] German speaking um majority which is the
[13:02] largest population in Switzerland they
[13:04] actually voted against joining the
[13:06] European Union back in the days 20 25 20
[13:09] 30 years ago or something um and the
[13:11] French and the Italians were actually in
[13:13] favor of it so I think now over time it
[13:16] has shown that to not join this um this
[13:21] this block so to say this political
[13:24] union um and seeking affiliation to this
[13:28] political Union by crafting carefully
[13:32] crafting uh bilateral contracts that
[13:35] allow certain freedoms but restrict
[13:37] others um that that was definitely the
[13:40] right move and I think we see that now
[13:43] uh and where do you see it usually how
[13:45] well a country is doing you see you see
[13:47] it usually in the in the in the currency
[13:50] um appreciating against others people
[13:52] trust these countries the
[13:54] structural um prerequisites more uh
[13:58] Switzerland has now a debt to GDP of
[14:01] roughly 30% uh we have
[14:03] 0.7% inflation uh when we have not
[14:07] joined the European Union which means
[14:09] we're not running under an
[14:10] ECB um policy that gives of course much
[14:14] more flexibility uh to move and to to
[14:17] tailor the the the instruments um in a
[14:21] way that it serves the population and
[14:23] the economy best and we see those
[14:25] results playing out right now it's also
[14:28] interesting we had the EU election this
[14:31] year and there are many other elections
[14:33] coming Austria had the national election
[14:36] Germany soon has a national election and
[14:38] kind of a trend that I see is those
[14:41] parties who are critical of EU policies
[14:44] like the digital Service Act uh in
[14:47] general EU uh they are becoming more
[14:50] powerful so it it almost seems that the
[14:53] skepticism against EU policies uh
[14:56] especially those who try to interfere
[14:59] give a freedom of the citizens those
[15:01] really seem to gain popularity which
[15:05] gives me a lot of hope that people are
[15:09] aware of the problem the people are kind
[15:12] of waking up to that and it's super
[15:14] interesting to see Switzerland also
[15:16] Switzerland basically has a very similar
[15:19] landscape than than Austria uh and I
[15:22] would say like Switzerland is for me the
[15:25] the Austria without the EU uh which
[15:28] which uh in my uh thinking right now is
[15:32] a positive thing even though I don't
[15:34] think right now Austria would benefit
[15:35] from exiting the EU but that's a whole
[15:38] another discussion uh but yeah it's h
[15:41] it's really interesting to see the
[15:42] European landscape and how it will
[15:45] develop politically o over time uh I
[15:48] think the next 10 years will be uh very
[15:51] exciting to see what's going on in in
[15:54] the you I think this is you're
[15:56] mentioning I mean at the end of the day
[15:58] that's ultimately
[15:59] case for Bitcoin right um because we are
[16:02] most interested to shape the world
[16:04] around us uh and if you own property if
[16:06] your children go to school um you want
[16:09] to you want to make sure that the space
[16:11] that you're living in works the best way
[16:14] possible and I think you know you with
[16:16] Bitcoin you get you at Le it gives you
[16:18] one element of of storing your value and
[16:21] retaining your purchasing power while
[16:23] being as mobile as you can possibly be
[16:26] so I think we will see a lot of
[16:27] reshuffling and a lot of of rejoicing um
[16:30] around where people move the degree to
[16:32] which people move is increasing and
[16:35] where do we have a proxy for that we see
[16:37] it uh through the rushing through of of
[16:42] country exiting taxes that rushed
[16:44] through parliaments uh because of course
[16:47] you want to prevent those freedoms now I
[16:49] think this is this is the big problem
[16:50] that that these bureaucratic top down
[16:54] structures simply have you cannot on the
[16:56] one hand advocate for freedom of
[16:59] movement of capital freedom of movement
[17:01] for humans and then tax them if they
[17:03] want to take their wealth with them so
[17:05] these are the inconsistencies that I
[17:07] that I see that I see um happening but
[17:10] people as always will find a way and um
[17:14] I'm I'm 100% bullish on human incentives
[17:18] and I'm 100% bearish on on on Ancient or
[17:22] arai policymaking because it just
[17:25] doesn't work and I think Bitcoin is just
[17:27] accelerating this movement that people
[17:30] move wherever they whereever they feel
[17:33] uh it fits it fits them best but it also
[17:35] forces governments to rethink their
[17:37] policies and I think if you then chose
[17:41] choose through your vote um then um well
[17:46] you've made your voice heard and if
[17:48] there is a a proponent that that picks
[17:52] up on that like Trump let's not kid
[17:54] ourselves like Trump did like the fdp
[17:57] the liberal party in in in Germany is
[18:00] doing right now so people smell the the
[18:03] the the the critical mass of bitcoiners
[18:05] the critical thinking and their
[18:07] willingness to move wherever it fits
[18:09] them best um and this is of course a
[18:12] non-ignorable um political force now as
[18:15] well and I hope I really hope that this
[18:17] is also starting to slowly reshape the
[18:21] political landscape and the political
[18:23] momentum and sort of reverts a lot of
[18:26] the unfortunate policymaking that has
[18:29] happened in the past that was super
[18:31] funny for me uh Christian Lindner
[18:35] talking about Bitcoin and he basically
[18:37] saying that the government he was in the
[18:41] chancellor of him he slept on bitcoin
[18:44] but he was for four years the Finance
[18:46] Minister while Germany was selling the
[18:49] Bitcoin while this was all going on and
[18:51] he's not which is not his fault by the
[18:52] way which is not his fault you know he
[18:54] get for something that is not
[18:56] within his authority yeah absolutely
[18:58] abely um but I think as a finance
[19:01] minister you can at least speak up like
[19:03] if you are a bitcoiner and you're the
[19:05] Finance Minister of of Germany and uh
[19:08] it's not Germany selling Bitcoin it's
[19:10] the Saxony District of of of Germany
[19:12] basically selling those Bitcoin and they
[19:14] have the laws and all those things and
[19:16] uh they have there all those things we
[19:18] covered that on the podcast sometimes um
[19:21] it it's not his fault but still he could
[19:24] SP speak up that about that and it's
[19:26] just really interesting to see on his
[19:29] last day office as as Finance Minister
[19:32] all of the sudden he speaks about
[19:33] Bitcoin I never heard any word about him
[19:36] or especially not in the parliament
[19:38] probably maybe on some podcast or some
[19:40] interview he probably mentioned Bitcoin
[19:42] in some way or or shape or form but it's
[19:44] really interesting uh that he now is no
[19:47] longer part of the government and on the
[19:50] first day where he's not on the
[19:51] government he's like hey Bitcoin us
[19:54] please please vote for the FTB please
[19:56] please do that uh and it will be really
[19:59] interesting to see how because Germany
[20:01] is really important for the EU it's it's
[20:03] the biggest country uh from almost all
[20:07] metrics probably uh for the EU so if
[20:10] Germany actually uh gets a pro e Bitcoin
[20:14] vote if like I don't know two parties
[20:17] adopt like a a good stance on bitcoin uh
[20:21] and those two parties maybe even like
[20:22] free parties um get a majority vote or
[20:25] like 40% or 50% of the vote this shows a
[20:28] lot then uh where the direction is going
[20:31] for the EU also because EU is basically
[20:34] just a collection of all the the
[20:36] countries so if the countries want
[20:38] something different the you want
[20:40] something different that's what was also
[20:42] the important thing here so I I do have
[20:45] a lot of hope to be honest uh for the EU
[20:48] uh and uh and I hope that uh Christan
[20:51] Lindner is now really for Bitcoin and he
[20:54] he's not just like in one speech and not
[20:55] just for the uh uh for the how is it
[20:59] called
[21:00] election the same way I hope that Trump
[21:02] actually also follow suit that he
[21:04] actually does something and not just is
[21:07] on the Bitcoin conference because he
[21:08] acknowledges that it's it's a big voters
[21:11] group the bitcoiners uh but yeah it's uh
[21:14] as you said in the beginning um you
[21:17] cannot jail be people anymore because
[21:20] they have Bitcoin the the empowerment of
[21:22] the individual it's a real big thing
[21:24] also something really beautiful that you
[21:26] said um that we we have to build
[21:29] basically we have to love our neighbors
[21:32] we have to build our neighborhoods and
[21:33] we have to really locally try to do good
[21:37] stuff and build good connections uh and
[21:40] then Grassroots Bitcoin movement will
[21:42] will come up and I think that's a
[21:44] beautiful thing uh to say uh and and and
[21:47] to do and yeah what the politicians will
[21:50] do will be a consequence of what the
[21:53] people really want and what the people
[21:55] push uh up uh to to the politics
[21:57] actually it should be pushing down to
[21:59] the politicians but that that's a whole
[22:00] another thing yeah I think I think this
[22:02] is exactly it you know um this Fiat
[22:06] system
[22:07] has unlearned who we are in so has
[22:11] unlearned or untrained Us in who we
[22:13] really are in society if we vote with
[22:16] our money we have enormous power over
[22:20] where resources are allocated what is
[22:23] produced and it's the same with votes we
[22:26] we we we have been trained into this
[22:28] belief that that policy leads people it
[22:34] has never been this way people lead
[22:36] policy and by extension politics so if
[22:41] we now have another option which is a
[22:44] nonpolitical or political option I mean
[22:46] you know can have an another podcast
[22:48] about what whether Bitcoin is political
[22:50] or not political but it shakes the
[22:53] equilibrium it's a disturbing force in
[22:55] this system and suddenly it allows
[22:57] people to look onto the Legacy system in
[23:01] in a very different way and suddenly you
[23:03] realize if I have Bitcoin there is a
[23:06] certain invincibility that comes with it
[23:09] and now suddenly I don't have to chase
[23:11] the politician but the politician has to
[23:13] chase me and I think one thing where we
[23:16] have to also be a bit patient and be a
[23:18] bit um more forgiving maybe in the
[23:21] community is you know who if I ask you
[23:26] who who had the purest of
[23:29] of
[23:30] motives um when he or she came into the
[23:33] Bitcoin space we all came for money go
[23:35] up we all came for raw self motives self
[23:38] in or incentives to to drive our or to
[23:41] to drive value of our bags and then we
[23:44] slowly started to you know go down the
[23:47] rabbit hole learn about it develop
[23:49] different perspectives onto it and I
[23:52] have no problem with the fact that the
[23:54] inevitable happens that a politician by
[23:57] raw in incentives and survival Instinct
[24:01] picks up on on on on bitcoin um because
[24:06] it just drives adoption it has the
[24:09] potential to accelerate adoption I think
[24:11] one of the most beautiful things about
[24:13] Bitcoin itself is the immutability of
[24:17] the protocol itself so the outcomes that
[24:19] Bitcoin Drive in terms of we save more
[24:23] we spend less we can use mining for you
[24:28] know
[24:29] um uh um making grits more efficient uh
[24:32] use stranded energy um um make
[24:37] electricity um systems more resilient
[24:40] all of this is all nice and Dy yeah and
[24:42] this is all good how you and and Bitcoin
[24:45] drives this deterministically there is
[24:48] no way that Bitcoin does not generate
[24:51] these societally positive nature
[24:54] positive climate positive outcomes and
[24:57] how you came into the space you're
[25:00] welcome let's be more because if you
[25:02] have inelastic supply and more brains
[25:06] flooding into this system it just will
[25:08] amplify the positive effects of what
[25:10] Bitcoin will do and we will need
[25:12] everybody we will need Capital we will
[25:14] need talent we will need Engineers we
[25:17] will need philosophers and we will also
[25:19] need politicians even if they don't
[25:21] understand that maybe it is actually
[25:26] making them more obsolete or faster
[25:28] obsolete or Legacy systems faster
[25:30] obsolete but that's then a normal cause
[25:33] of life and the circle of life you know
[25:35] things are building things get to a to a
[25:40] to a pinnacle State and then they Decay
[25:42] and I think we're seeing this what I
[25:45] like to call a reinstitutionalization
[25:47] because we had institutions they worked
[25:50] for a very long time they work to Serve
[25:52] the People very well but slowly
[25:55] somewhere around 2000 at maximum
[25:58] impact in 2008 the societal contract
[26:02] between those institutions and the
[26:04] people has been broken and it has been
[26:06] increasingly broken ever since that's
[26:09] why I think also broken money is such a
[26:11] good title um and now we have inevitably
[26:14] a reinstitutionalization the
[26:16] reinstitutionalization of money we
[26:18] redefine what money is uh we redefine
[26:21] what institutions are on in in a more
[26:25] networked Society uh we might uh 100
[26:28] years from now even rethink what a state
[26:31] is because probably will not even need
[26:33] this anymore because we have other means
[26:35] to organize ourselves in in a meaningful
[26:39] and efficient way and I think this is
[26:41] this is the magic moment that we live
[26:43] through and it it's totally normal that
[26:47] things um that you participate in your
[26:50] own Decay you know Kodak developed the
[26:53] first digital camera did they capitalize
[26:56] on it no did it even kill them yes so I
[27:00] think this is a normal progression and
[27:02] things that happen in nature things that
[27:04] happen in the economy we for some reason
[27:07] believe that in institutional terms this
[27:10] cannot happen no of course it happens it
[27:12] continuously renews itself it evolves
[27:14] and I think we have probably this might
[27:18] be recency bias on our end but I think
[27:20] we have never seen a more radical and
[27:22] accelerated form of
[27:24] reinstitutionalization that we're seeing
[27:26] currently and I think it's
[27:28] fascinating to be part of that
[27:31] Journey it's something uh really
[27:33] interesting also going you are also part
[27:36] of the we talked about the before the
[27:38] European Bitcoin energy Association I
[27:41] got it right right yeah perfect um uh
[27:44] what is that and and what are you trying
[27:46] to accomplish there I think the the idea
[27:49] of ebba started from understanding that
[27:53] if we want broad societal acceptance of
[27:57] Bitcoin um we need to go beyond the
[28:00] monetary or the the the prop monetary
[28:02] property of the asset itself as a store
[28:05] of value instrument and I think Bitcoin
[28:07] offers much more and
[28:10] um Bitcoin requires energy as an
[28:14] extrinsic as an extrinsic factor to to
[28:17] maintain the Integrity of The Ledger but
[28:19] it's in of course through that it's
[28:22] integrate integral to or and integrally
[28:26] in in integrally dependent on the energy
[28:30] infrastructure um itself as well and
[28:33] what we've seen is and what we have
[28:34] learned also through Bitcoin and
[28:37] studying Bitcoin and Bitcoin related use
[28:39] cases is just to surface how inefficient
[28:42] how vulnerable Energy Systems actually
[28:45] are and uh we see that more and more now
[28:48] and we can if you want to we can go much
[28:50] deeper into that but I think the key
[28:53] message is let's look at something that
[28:57] provides this societally positive
[28:59] outcomes but let's also look at it as an
[29:03] instrument as a as a leverage instrument
[29:05] how we can make our Energy Systems more
[29:09] resilient how we can provide more energy
[29:12] to more people because we will need
[29:15] significantly significantly more energy
[29:18] in the future and not less this is a big
[29:20] gaslighting lie that we will need or
[29:23] that we will only require less energy in
[29:25] the future no we will need much more and
[29:28] to communicate those positive outcomes
[29:32] that Bitcoin mining can provide for the
[29:35] energy system and by extension for the
[29:38] pro for the prosperity or the prospect
[29:40] of prosperity for the people this is
[29:43] hugely important because this is what
[29:45] people care about if you can show them
[29:48] how something can provide them real real
[29:51] value in the real world in their lives
[29:54] that's a good thing and even if you
[29:56] don't save in bit coin you might be
[29:59] interested in having the cheapest
[30:01] possible Energy bill at the end of the
[30:04] month and so the funny thing and this is
[30:07] really an irony is that one of the few
[30:10] policy decisions one of the few policy
[30:13] pushes that the EU got relatively right
[30:16] is how to rethink energy infrastructure
[30:19] and energy systems in
[30:22] Europe we could go into detail but this
[30:24] is this becomes then very very technical
[30:27] and the funny thing is it has in a way
[30:31] by the language it has chosen Bitcoin
[30:33] mining written all over it but the
[30:37] politicians the tech the technical
[30:39] people the ones that have sort of
[30:41] advised the policym they have not
[30:43] connected the dots so what EB is trying
[30:46] to do is to collect as many use cases as
[30:50] possible to provide as much factual
[30:52] evidence as possible so that it also can
[30:55] positively inform policym so that we use
[30:58] the opportunity for Bitcoin mining that
[31:01] are already written in the laws that are
[31:04] law right now and so these are these are
[31:07] laws around
[31:08] how how um you know Energy Systems have
[31:14] to ensure that um energy is optimally um
[31:19] consumed that curtailment is not an
[31:22] option anymore uh that you are not
[31:24] allowed to curtail uh so you need to
[31:27] generate so you need also to to provide
[31:30] business cases that um that that can
[31:33] take off this energy in the most
[31:35] opportunistic way possible um how new
[31:39] how new build outs can be monetized and
[31:42] so on and so forth how heat needs to be
[31:45] red reused this is not only a Bitcoin uh
[31:48] mining related issue also every data
[31:51] center now in Europe will'll look at
[31:54] reusing the heat uh for for uh heat as a
[31:58] service purposes and we I think we can
[32:00] all agree that's a good thing and
[32:03] ironically this heat reuse push which is
[32:06] one of the last one of the most recent I
[32:09] would say sort of technical innovations
[32:12] that Bitcoin mining brought about this
[32:14] is in a way an indirect result of the
[32:17] European
[32:18] policymaking um while of course hashr
[32:21] went skyrocketed and and and miners were
[32:24] looking to diversify their revenue
[32:26] streams yes that's all nice and D but
[32:28] you see there's a lot of Confluence from
[32:31] the the the the technical push from the
[32:33] side of the technical push and the
[32:34] technical requirement the economic
[32:36] requirement and the policy requirements
[32:39] and to communicate that Upstream to the
[32:41] politician is incredibly useful for them
[32:45] but also to communicate Downstream and
[32:48] help the the industry to understand what
[32:52] are the dos and don'ts Within These
[32:54] policies what where can you push into to
[32:58] safely where are you safe where you know
[33:00] where are you testing the Frontiers uh
[33:02] this is also very useful and like that
[33:04] we sort of build a platform of of
[33:07] conversation between the use cases and
[33:10] the policymaking which we hope then to
[33:12] be able to amplify not only from the EUR
[33:15] on the European level but also on the
[33:17] nation state level so I'm I'm doing work
[33:19] on that in that regard in Switzerland
[33:22] and of course opportunities like the
[33:24] Parliamentary inquiry from the Canton of
[33:26] burn that needs to study those um
[33:29] effects of Bitcoin mining this is where
[33:32] our results then come handy and we can
[33:34] provide the evidence so that hopefully
[33:36] uh policy can shift into a Bitcoin
[33:38] mining spor I partnered up with coin
[33:42] vigilante this is the most beautiful
[33:45] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw
[33:47] created by anyone look at that beauty I
[33:50] love it so much coin vigilante made a
[33:53] perfect Bitcoin watch that's the perfect
[33:56] subtle elegent way to go out there and
[33:59] show that you are a bitcoiner and that
[34:01] watch brand is Bitcoin only and coin
[34:05] vigilante just dropped a completely new
[34:08] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[34:11] watch collections you have the date of
[34:13] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[34:17] there and of course also the block
[34:19] height and which EPO we are currently in
[34:22] I love the level of detail they put in
[34:25] in this masterpiece and make sure sure
[34:27] to check out those amazing coin
[34:29] vigilante time pieces down in the
[34:32] descriptions I love those watches so so
[34:35] much if you watch or listen to my
[34:38] podcast on a regular basis I'll guess
[34:40] you already bought some Bitcoin and now
[34:43] the most important step is to keep the
[34:46] Bitcoin keep them secure in a hardware
[34:48] wallet my personal recommendation for
[34:50] Hardware wallet is the bit box it's
[34:52] super secure it's simple to set up it's
[34:55] also perfect gift for a friend who has
[34:57] still the Bitcoin on an exchange and you
[35:00] can get a 5% discount with the code
[35:03] Robin at the checkout visit bitbox do
[35:07] Swiss robobin to get your bitbox and the
[35:10] next step is to really level up your
[35:13] sovereignty as an individual you have to
[35:15] have the most secure self custody setup
[35:18] you have to secure your own devices you
[35:21] have to protect your privacy you have to
[35:24] set up an inheritance plan and depending
[35:27] on where you live you even want to have
[35:29] a plan B a citizenship where you can
[35:32] move in case something goes really
[35:34] really wrong and through all those steps
[35:36] the Bitcoin way is guiding you through
[35:38] step by step and if you visit the
[35:41] Bitcoin way.com
[35:43] Partners SL robobin you even get a 30
[35:46] minute free call to find out how you can
[35:49] level up your sovereignty interesting
[35:52] yeah it seems to be so obvious that the
[35:54] energy sector should be into Bitcoin
[35:57] that the energy sector is like oh like
[35:59] let's let's all have more Bitcoin miners
[36:02] when I hear where uh you get paid to
[36:05] have a Bitcoin mining side just to stand
[36:08] by to take some electricity off the grid
[36:11] uh even in Austria what 20 21
[36:13] energy some projects there or I talked
[36:17] with Americans they say like they have
[36:19] to pay to get energy off and the energy
[36:22] providers because sometimes it's too
[36:23] much um like yeah like just plug in a
[36:26] Bitcoin m
[36:28] and your problem is solved it it it
[36:30] seems to be so
[36:32] obvious but not a lot of companies
[36:34] actually do it uh now that there seems
[36:36] to be a discrepancy between uh the the
[36:40] the actual use case of it versus the
[36:43] people actually using it so like the the
[36:46] use case is there uh the the tools are
[36:49] there the all everything is there is it
[36:51] is it just education is it is it just
[36:54] time that that we need there or yeah
[36:58] it's a good one um education is
[37:02] critically
[37:03] important um when I say education I mean
[37:07] can we sit someone from the energy
[37:10] sector down explain them that we
[37:13] understand their problems uh which is
[37:15] essentially um a demand
[37:18] Supply uh mismatch um and that we
[37:22] understand how they're dealing with it
[37:24] currently um the the nuts and bolds of
[37:27] how curtailment actually work and that
[37:30] suddenly you propose a solution that
[37:33] allows you to not having to do this so
[37:36] curtailment sounds so simple when you
[37:38] read it in 140 characters on Twitter but
[37:41] it's actually a very very sophisticated
[37:43] thing that needs to happen um and so
[37:47] this is not and everything that is you
[37:49] know it's a typical engineering question
[37:51] everything that is sophisticated and
[37:53] complex also has a lot of is errorr yeah
[37:56] so if you make something less error
[38:00] prone by avoiding having to do something
[38:03] that is super complex is already a win
[38:05] and I think this is often misunderstood
[38:07] when we say we help someone to off take
[38:10] Surplus energy this is not necessarily
[38:12] only the economic value that matters it
[38:15] is the the the risk um that that matters
[38:19] the risk prevention that matters that
[38:21] something goes wrong like we have seen
[38:23] recently also in Germany and European
[38:26] countries when suddenly then um supply
[38:29] and demand mismatch cannot be um um
[38:34] rectified and then prices just Skyrocket
[38:37] um into the into the thousands of
[38:39] dollars per megawatt hour the second P
[38:42] the
[38:43] second uh element is incentives we are
[38:46] again at incentives the the the energy
[38:49] systems are dramatically uh to an
[38:52] dramatic extent uh falsely incentivized
[38:56] currently energy
[38:58] generators uh make so much money so much
[39:02] money they don't have any incentive to
[39:05] change any of that uh by introducing
[39:08] uncertainties that they don't understand
[39:10] and cannot control so this is the second
[39:12] one and then you have um also a um a
[39:17] large problem around roles and
[39:19] responsibilities because we when we
[39:21] speak about energy the energy sector
[39:24] it's actually a lot of actors you have
[39:26] the power generators you have the
[39:28] aggregators and then you have the
[39:30] so-called tsos the transmission system
[39:33] operators and those are usually the
[39:35] limiting factor in many ways because the
[39:38] think of it like a like a river uh the
[39:41] TSO Define how much water can actually
[39:44] go through so even if you have more
[39:46] water
[39:46] Upstream uh there's just not more water
[39:49] that can go through and uh obviously
[39:52] what you then do if you can control how
[39:54] much water is up there you say well you
[39:57] know
[39:58] my power my water that I produce or that
[40:01] is generated up there does not uh find
[40:05] its final destination so I either do not
[40:08] build it or I or Cil it or um um I even
[40:13] dismantle it because there's no economic
[40:16] case for it and it's exactly the same in
[40:18] the Power Systems um our power demand
[40:21] has increased so dramatically over the
[40:24] past 20 years and it's not only the
[40:26] power demand in itself but the
[40:28] electrified power this is this is a very
[40:30] very important U specification but the
[40:34] infrastructure that transmits that power
[40:36] has not been updated uh significantly so
[40:40] essentially a lot of Supply now meets
[40:43] very very very constrained transmission
[40:46] capacity to bring power from A to B and
[40:50] these uh system operators these
[40:52] transmission system operators they are
[40:54] not incentivized in how much power goes
[40:58] through from A to B they are
[41:00] incentivized in the Integrity of the
[41:02] grid so they need to keep the frequency
[41:05] at the specific values because this is
[41:08] how they are incentivized and if you now
[41:11] as a as a as a Upstream supplier of
[41:14] power go to the tsos and say but I have
[41:17] power I need to give this to you then
[41:19] they say it's none of my interest um I
[41:23] I'm not incentivized to build out more
[41:26] transmission Capac capity and the
[41:28] politicians then Force the tsos to do
[41:32] something about it but then the tsos say
[41:34] well this is very expensive and if you
[41:37] make me do that then I will put the the
[41:41] the the expenditure for this buildout
[41:45] onto the bills of um the consumers and
[41:48] that is not a very popular political
[41:51] decision either so they have a lot of
[41:53] bargaining power and very little
[41:56] incentive in
[41:58] um rolling out more transmission
[42:00] capacity which brings me to bitcoin and
[42:02] now obviously we can now think of an
[42:05] alternative scenario we will always need
[42:07] transmission this is absolutely key but
[42:11] what Bitcoin mining offers is to off
[42:14] take at source so we may not need a
[42:17] transmission capacity to monetize the
[42:19] power that is there we can do it on site
[42:22] and that allows us to build smaller
[42:25] energy communities smaller energy units
[42:29] uh a huge factor which is under
[42:31] discussed is how batteries and and
[42:34] storage capacity will also provide a
[42:38] technological platform for new business
[42:40] cases that we don't even know yet how
[42:42] they will look like but what we will see
[42:44] over time is that because we need more
[42:47] power where we need
[42:48] it generation will also move there and
[42:52] transmission will always be important
[42:54] but transmission will be uh less and
[42:57] less important in the future but what we
[42:59] will see is is a is a decentralization
[43:02] of the energy systems and Bitcoin mining
[43:04] incentivizes that as well because we can
[43:07] monetize now the the power ad source and
[43:11] that's a very very beautiful thing
[43:12] because more decentralized systems also
[43:16] means more resilient systems and that's
[43:18] a very very positive future for the
[43:21] energy systems um as well inter it it's
[43:25] it it it still seems very
[43:27] obvious to me but it's it's it it was a
[43:30] good explanation of like what what are
[43:32] the roadblocks there and what are the
[43:34] challenges there and and the incentive
[43:36] structure is definitely very interesting
[43:39] as if you don't have the incentive to do
[43:41] something you will not do it oh no oh no
[43:44] no and this is I think the first thing
[43:45] that we as bitcoiners should should
[43:48] appreciate about another person because
[43:50] we know how strong our incentives are to
[43:52] do something or to not do something so
[43:55] you know we need to Grant the same right
[43:57] even if we disagree with it even if it's
[43:59] a net negative for for themselves and
[44:02] Society uh but you know this is then the
[44:05] Peter Shi syndrome you can understand
[44:07] the problem but uh you can still not act
[44:09] on it for whatever reason yeah Peter Shi
[44:11] is a is an interesting character I I I I
[44:15] think he's just afraid that he loses
[44:18] face at this this point he's he's too
[44:21] intelligent he's too smart to not
[44:24] understand Bitcoin oh he feeds off you
[44:27] know he's like he feeds off the Bitcoin
[44:29] as ha and I think you know he's just a
[44:31] professional poster that sits at
[44:34] home in his in his underwear drinks a
[44:36] beer and has a laugh every day that he
[44:38] can
[44:39] trigger 100 million Bitcoin is that that
[44:43] that's true yeah uh it's hard to decide
[44:46] if he's uh actually not getting it or at
[44:51] this point just trolling bitcoiners I
[44:54] have I have no clue uh uh what's
[44:58] actually going on but yeah I also don't
[45:00] have really an incentive to find out
[45:02] yeah
[45:03] exactly really cool perfect um one thing
[45:07] that you also discussed with uh I think
[45:10] I don't know if you recorded that or we
[45:12] discussed it before was the investment
[45:15] uh Legacy uh people coming into Bitcoin
[45:19] um and I here when I go into Legacy uh
[45:24] investment there's a lot of
[45:28] uh ESG Investments a lot of like oh we
[45:30] have to invest there because there are
[45:32] some rules around that is that a big
[45:35] discussion or is that kind of what what
[45:37] you meant by that yeah maybe to to to to
[45:42] describe the lay of the land um capital
[45:46] is an interesting Beast because I think
[45:51] um Capital has one trade that is very
[45:55] interesting it
[45:57] senses change much quicker uh because uh
[46:01] you know change is often very tcid uh
[46:05] very very immaterial something diffuse
[46:09] uh but
[46:10] Capital usually sees it in profits
[46:15] spreads and margins and capital is very
[46:18] very sensitive to changes in those in
[46:21] those structures yeah so that's for
[46:23] instance also one of the reasons why why
[46:26] I'm firm a firm believer that there will
[46:28] be a demonetization of real estate um
[46:32] and and and Bitcoin will be one of the
[46:34] big profiteers on that end because it's
[46:37] just Capital just sees that with the
[46:40] different risk profiles around real
[46:43] estate the market conditions around real
[46:45] estate um the the the macro environment
[46:49] around real estate it's not a favor
[46:50] environment to be in now this takes time
[46:53] to shift from one investment class to
[46:55] the next at scale um but it's going to
[47:00] happen and I think what I'm interested
[47:02] in um and this is sort of what I bring
[47:06] uh or this this interface that I'm
[47:07] bringing into the conversation is that
[47:10] I've seen how these ESG Capital Pools
[47:13] think they had a
[47:15] very they had the time of their life
[47:18] between 2016 and
[47:21] 20120 2021 is around where suddenly the
[47:26] entire topic of of climate change
[47:29] biodiversity nature positive investment
[47:32] sort of moved from you know the dark
[47:34] Corners into bright light yeah and you
[47:37] can say about uh greater thumber
[47:39] whatever you want but but she has
[47:41] managed to change the
[47:43] conversation um and the societal framing
[47:46] of this conversation and capital
[47:48] followed suit you saw that the amounts
[47:51] of money that's suddenly labeled as ESG
[47:54] that's suddenly labeled as climate ATT
[47:57] um and invested as such uh was was
[48:00] massive but as we know from Bitcoin um
[48:04] Hypes don't last that long and usually
[48:07] they are followed by a correction and I
[48:09] think this is exactly the correction
[48:11] that we're currently seeing um it's
[48:13] interesting to observe that high
[48:16] interest rates combined made uh a
[48:20] restrictive monetary policy has been a
[48:23] killer for every hyped capital
[48:27] allocation and ESG and climate Tech was
[48:30] one of those so you now have a lot of
[48:33] Capital Pools that sit on heavier bag
[48:36] than we in 2017 yeah so they have bought
[48:40] overvalued Investments that have now
[48:43] corrected value massively they have been
[48:45] marked down massively um and there's no
[48:50] good new Ventures and no good investment
[48:54] thesis um and no new and no good
[48:58] directionality for those type of
[49:00] Investments and what I mean by that is
[49:02] regulatory Clarity what you don't want
[49:05] as an investor is that black rock is
[49:08] 2020 ESG all over the place and ditches
[49:13] ESG in 2024 this is not a good thing for
[49:18] Capital allocator because they usually
[49:20] operate on time Horizons of 5 to eight
[49:22] years and if you can see that the
[49:24] narrative can shift so dramatically
[49:26] Within three four years you are not
[49:29] going there and so what I love about the
[49:33] the the the climate Bitcoin thesis is
[49:36] that as we said beforehand that Bitcoin
[49:39] just also which is one dimension
[49:41] provides these
[49:43] incredibly deterministic climate
[49:46] positive outcomes and nature positive
[49:49] outcomes there's many such cases 21
[49:51] energy is one of those if you manage to
[49:55] use heat as a Sur
[49:57] while mining Bitcoin you have the
[49:59] potential to disrupt any oil and gas
[50:01] heating system oil and gas heating
[50:04] system and building management is 15% of
[50:07] the CO2 emissions uh of the annual
[50:10] inventory so we're talking about big
[50:12] numbers here yeah uh and so as these
[50:16] companies are now seeing or experiencing
[50:20] their hangover from The High Times that
[50:22] they had and they overlooked the top and
[50:24] they are now holding very very heavy
[50:26] bags
[50:27] they're desperate to look for new
[50:29] investment and growth thesis around
[50:32] nature positivity because that's
[50:34] actually a good thing even if many
[50:36] bitcoiners do not agree with that you
[50:38] know um and Bitcoin at the same time and
[50:42] luckily enough Bitcoin offers that and
[50:45] so that's a that's a very very good
[50:46] thing and I see this these changes
[50:49] slowly happening and it surprised me
[50:52] that people like Max Kaiser for instance
[50:54] um picked up on that issue
[50:57] and and he said look climate change is
[51:00] real if you believe in it or not it's
[51:02] actually it's it's my opinion or my view
[51:06] or my scientific savviness is not
[51:08] relevant what where we see that things
[51:11] are changing is in commodity pricing
[51:16] commodity price price Discovery we see
[51:19] it in uh inflation around products and
[51:22] services if you own a house today in
[51:24] California you'd better sell
[51:27] because your fire insurance bill has
[51:29] been Skyrock to for 10,000% in the pre
[51:33] in the in the recent years this is not
[51:36] because someone just wants to rip you
[51:38] off because but it is a it isn't it
[51:41] isn't a ricing the uh um it's a
[51:46] repricing of a
[51:48] service um that everybody needs but had
[51:52] to be repriced given the the the recent
[51:55] history and so funnily enough this is
[51:58] where we see um climate change
[52:01] manifesting uh and we see it in the
[52:03] capital markets and we see it in the
[52:05] commodity markets and we see it in the
[52:07] service markets and so uh this is for
[52:10] instance also one of the arguments why
[52:11] there's going to be an increasing
[52:13] pressure on real estate because flooding
[52:15] droughts fires and so on and so forth
[52:18] for immobile Goods is not a good
[52:21] combination yeah so in a way the most
[52:25] the best hatch against climate change or
[52:29] climate change vulnerable investment is
[52:31] Bitcoin as well because I can now take
[52:34] my wealth with me even if on on balance
[52:37] the two values have the same asset value
[52:41] I would always choose Bitcoin because
[52:43] this is the one that is less vulnerable
[52:45] to these environmental risks that we're
[52:48] increasingly observing and so I think
[52:51] for us as private individuals for us as
[52:53] advisers for us that that work with
[52:55] Capital Pools it's much easier to talk
[52:57] about it it's much harder to shift the
[52:59] narrative within an organization that
[53:01] has governance rules and so on and so
[53:03] forth but we see this happening and we
[53:05] see it changing as well so my hope is
[53:08] that also this this interface or this
[53:11] gap between ESG capital and um and and
[53:15] Bitcoin will close over time and this is
[53:20] exactly where I'm positioned where I'm
[53:21] helping to translate also why this is
[53:23] actually a good investment case and how
[53:25] you can build an Investment Portfolio
[53:28] around uh uh climate Tech or climate
[53:32] positive outcomes and um and Bitcoin I
[53:37] think that's an great uh intersection uh
[53:39] to to be in and I had uh I just not this
[53:43] because uh I have a lot of guests on but
[53:46] the guests talking about Bitcoin mining
[53:48] within the last like week or even like
[53:52] in last like one and a half months been
[53:54] increasing really a lot I think bit
[53:56] mining is an overlooked uh topic and I I
[53:59] talked yesterday so for the fewers
[54:02] probably like three four episodes behind
[54:06] um uh about that block space uh and that
[54:10] being a critical infrastructure for
[54:14] countries and that being kind of almost
[54:16] like a Warfare of who has the most power
[54:20] of that block space in the future and we
[54:23] should not talk about National strategic
[54:25] Reserve should talk about who has the
[54:28] most block hash rate uh in which country
[54:31] and who is controlling that block space
[54:33] are is small miners are it's big miners
[54:35] are in the middle uh what pools are they
[54:38] having how many pools do we have so I
[54:41] think there are super interesting topics
[54:43] in Bitcoin mining and I will set it
[54:45] myself as a small goal for next year to
[54:48] to get more into Bitcoin mining to
[54:50] actually gain more knowledge in that
[54:52] because there are really interesting
[54:54] Topics in there and so thank you so much
[54:55] for for bring bringing one uh facet uh
[54:59] of Bitcoin mining uh to this podcast I
[55:01] think it was highly informative already
[55:04] most welcome thank you very much for the
[55:06] feedback yeah I mean yeah I think the
[55:09] cool thing is that so I think for us as
[55:12] observers um you know I'm always taking
[55:15] two two perspectives I'm I'm an observer
[55:18] that looks sort of what's happening on a
[55:20] net
[55:22] Global um uh uh scope and what's
[55:26] happening you know if you're a minor I
[55:28] think miners will disagree with me
[55:30] because they will they will
[55:32] say times will get much much harder in
[55:35] the future I think I predict that in in
[55:37] one year from now in two years from now
[55:40] 60 70% of the mining use cases that we
[55:44] know today will not exist anymore will
[55:46] be disrupted by other application as it
[55:49] should be it they will be disrupted by
[55:52] uh storage capacity and storage based uh
[55:55] use cases they will um be um uh uh
[55:59] disrupted by higher premium higher value
[56:03] applications like artificial
[56:04] intelligence rendering or other um uh
[56:07] computer as a service um uh
[56:11] applications but for Bitcoin mining from
[56:15] a from a from a Global Perspective I
[56:17] think this is an incredibly exciting
[56:19] time because we are about to witness the
[56:21] next generation of mining Innovation we
[56:24] don't know yet where the next source of
[56:27] stranded electricity and power is we
[56:30] don't know yet which additional revenue
[56:33] streams will be able to be extracted uh
[56:37] that that will help value extraction out
[56:39] of the mining process we don't know that
[56:40] yet but we get a glimpse if we look for
[56:43] instance into the emirats um just as an
[56:46] example one of the largest solar powered
[56:49] um uh solar PB Farms it has been um uh
[56:55] finished this year in in Saudi Arabia
[56:57] 600 megawatt uh it's a fairly decent
[57:02] size um and in electricity and power you
[57:06] have one concept which is called uh
[57:08] legalized cost of electricity LC o e it
[57:13] essentially provides a unit of account a
[57:16] meter to compare one power the price of
[57:19] one power generation with another um and
[57:22] so you you you look into the Upstream
[57:25] capex that you need to generate the
[57:27] power the the the the uh the refinement
[57:31] the the the um the dispatching and also
[57:35] at the end of life the maintenance and
[57:37] then at the end of life the the end of
[57:39] life processing of all of that and um
[57:42] this is a very important go because it
[57:45] tells you where the economic incentives
[57:48] are and you can see that because you
[57:50] know oil is getting more and more
[57:52] difficult to to to find and to
[57:56] uh and to extract we see the legalized
[57:59] cost of energy for for oil and gas going
[58:02] up and then you see uh solar PV which is
[58:07] falling of a cliff and just to give you
[58:09] an idea of how much falling of a cliff
[58:12] they are you have the the International
[58:15] Energy um um uh agency has
[58:20] predicted around 1 cent per kilowatt
[58:23] hour in the year 2050 the stabilized
[58:26] cost of electricity and this power plant
[58:30] um in Saudi Arabia has achieved lcoe of
[58:34] 1.05 cents per kilowatt hour in year
[58:39] 2024 meaning 26 years before it was
[58:42] initially predicted so this is how cheap
[58:45] solar power is now you rightfully will
[58:47] argue yes but this doesn't help us
[58:50] because we need base load we need
[58:51] dispatchable base load and that is all
[58:54] very true that's why I predicted the the
[58:56] Renaissance of of of nuclear already
[58:59] years back because that's essentially
[59:01] the The Sweet Spot of how power can be
[59:05] generated that is low emission and base
[59:08] load and at scale but what is stunning
[59:11] is that if you if you read between the
[59:13] lines the saies have immediately
[59:15] partnered with the large scale uh miners
[59:19] to provide this biof first Resort
[59:23] infrastructure to actually oft take the
[59:26] power that is generated there and why do
[59:28] they do this BEC not because they want
[59:30] to mine Bitcoin yes of course they want
[59:32] to mine Bitcoin because if you have and
[59:35] that's what you mean I think by by by
[59:37] hash block hash or block hash blocks
[59:40] block space I think you called it um if
[59:43] you have significant amount of of mining
[59:45] power and you have a statistical chance
[59:50] of mining every thousands or 5,000
[59:53] blocks you're not interested in in the
[59:57] economic viability of your business case
[59:59] what you want is to be able to clear
[60:01] your own transaction and constitute your
[60:03] own block so essentially that means that
[60:05] you have suddenly built power
[60:07] infrastructure but you have also uh
[60:10] secured a Lifeline for your transactions
[60:13] should you be um cut off the Swift
[60:17] Network for any reason so suddenly you
[60:20] have secured your power infrastructure
[60:22] and you have created a business case
[60:23] that is non-economic it is a business
[60:26] case of of National Security that you
[60:29] know that once in a while you will be
[60:31] able to constitute your own block and
[60:33] clear your own transactions but in the
[60:35] meantime you of course built the
[60:38] infrastructure the distribution
[60:40] infrastructure the oftaking
[60:42] infrastructure the storage
[60:44] infrastructure that provides the
[60:46] infrastructure that can take off the
[60:48] power the power as well and
[60:51] slowly the miners will be phased out and
[60:54] other business cases will come along and
[60:57] as it should be it's only a a power of
[61:00] taker of first and last resort and the
[61:04] marginalization in the beginning of the
[61:06] of the economic cycle and the end of the
[61:08] economic cycle will be is getting
[61:11] shorter and shorter and shorter yeah so
[61:13] I don't think that we will see these
[61:15] large scale data centers somewhere
[61:17] anywhere in Europe but that's a good
[61:19] thing net POS it's net positive for the
[61:22] distribution of the hash rate um that
[61:25] German Engineers will build the best kyc
[61:28] tools to Shadow mine uh integrate that
[61:33] into their sellers into their into their
[61:35] you know Mini profitability cases in
[61:38] their own solar panels uh infrastructure
[61:41] with their neighbor whatever I don't
[61:43] know where this is going but I think
[61:44] over time we will see hash rate getting
[61:47] more and more under pressure or mining
[61:49] getting more and more under pressure or
[61:51] mining uh profitability getting more and
[61:53] more under pressure with an increased
[61:55] need of looking for even more stranded
[61:57] sources of
[61:58] energy and so on and so forth and the
[62:02] pressure for alternative uh business
[62:05] cases that provide more economic
[62:09] viability to to the one who runs the
[62:12] side will get higher and higher and
[62:14] higher and I think this will just
[62:16] substantiate and make the make it incred
[62:19] make the Bitcoin Network incredibly
[62:21] robust but it also means that 90% of the
[62:24] miners that we know today will probably
[62:27] not survive 90% of the mining use cases
[62:32] uh uh will probably not survive but it
[62:35] it just over time it will just you know
[62:37] human Ingenuity will drive The
[62:39] Innovation forward super interesting I I
[62:42] love that that space already Bitcoin
[62:45] mining 350 podcast episodes and I'm
[62:48] still learning new stuff every day it's
[62:51] it's fascinating um but uh coming to one
[62:55] question I ask each and every one of my
[62:57] guests is what can we learn from you
[62:59] besides Bitcoin oh my
[63:02] God from me or about
[63:05] me well from you but it can also be
[63:09] about you as as as you want from me and
[63:11] take it from someone that is already
[63:13] older because I'm really feeling I'm 46
[63:16] by now um um I'm I'm feeling old in this
[63:19] space Oh you're the average
[63:22] bitcoiner thank you you're you're too
[63:24] kind I have I have dat to back up
[63:30] wait that makes me that makes me feel
[63:33] better no but I think you know we all
[63:37] say we move away from where we are um we
[63:40] need to fit the certain bill because
[63:42] this is what uh the Twitter Echo chamber
[63:46] um makes us believe that you know that
[63:48] there's only one way to think about um
[63:51] uh the world I think one of the big
[63:54] beauties of the space is that that
[63:57] everybody is a bitcoiner and something
[63:59] else and I I would wish that people
[64:01] would be more vocal and more proud of
[64:04] the something else that they are as well
[64:07] because this is exactly what we need you
[64:09] know big things happen at the interface
[64:12] of one thing and another yeah the the
[64:16] the the lat Latin word or the the word
[64:18] intelligence comes from inter from the
[64:21] Latin iner it means between the lines
[64:24] and we need to have two lines to between
[64:27] the lines and I think this is exactly
[64:29] this this knowledge that each and
[64:31] everybody holds but we're not vocal
[64:35] enough because we tend to bash on on on
[64:38] on people for you
[64:39] know the their their their uh
[64:43] non-conformal Bitcoin views and and the
[64:46] things that they are as well and I wish
[64:48] that people could be would be more proud
[64:51] of the something else that they are as
[64:53] well so I'm an environmentalist I care
[64:56] where um how our nature looks like uh I
[65:00] know what it means to to have an
[65:03] increasing amount of of extreme weather
[65:05] events I don't want to be in the space
[65:08] to say I told you so and I think
[65:10] everybody carries these knowledge and
[65:12] our our space would be much richer if it
[65:14] would be also more vocal about it and I
[65:17] love Switzerland I love to be here I
[65:19] would not move to El Salvador maybe I
[65:21] hope I can visit it at some point uh but
[65:24] also stay where you are because you are
[65:26] needed where you are um yeah you can
[65:29] bring a lot of this sometimes we want to
[65:31] push things into the Bitcoin space but
[65:34] actually sometimes I think it's even
[65:36] cooler to pull from the Bitcoin space
[65:39] into the space where you are because
[65:41] sooner or later Bitcoin will anyways
[65:44] come to you just be
[65:46] patient that's that's a that's a great
[65:48] way to look at it um I I will just show
[65:51] you um I have
[65:54] around uh some 50,000 some 40,000 some
[65:57] 100,000 uh Watchers every month on on on
[66:01] YouTube depends on the month uh so it's
[66:04] not representative of the whole Space uh
[66:08] but I can show
[66:10] you that the age range of my viewers
[66:14] here even though I'm very young so uh
[66:17] young hosts probably get more young
[66:20] audience uh the average is 35 to 40 uh 4
[66:25] years and the range of 45 to 55 years is
[66:31] bigger uh by a substantial amount bigger
[66:34] than 25 to 45 years so I guess the the
[66:38] average will be probably uh around 45 to
[66:42] 50 uh more likely uh and when you look
[66:46] at the numbers of how many people are
[66:49] there under
[66:51] 18 zero apparently nobody under 18 years
[66:56] watches that channel uh maybe also has
[66:59] something to do that I don't right now
[67:01] don't do shorts I will do them in the
[67:03] future again uh and above 65 which is
[67:07] really like I'm 26 there's a big range
[67:10] to to 65 years old uh 6.1% that's a huge
[67:15] amount that's a huge number also there
[67:17] so super interesting the the space is
[67:20] more mature than uh than you might think
[67:24] I've also thought it's it's it's younger
[67:26] than that but it's act actually not uh
[67:28] and that's from a young YouTube Bitcoin
[67:30] only uh host uh if if I would be let's
[67:35] say 50 probably uh that would be even
[67:39] more screwed towards an older a older
[67:42] age uh because yeah people like people
[67:46] that are familiar and stuff like that I
[67:48] just wanted to to show you this that I
[67:50] think you are right around the the
[67:52] average age of a bitcoiner it's
[67:54] fascinating
[67:56] we we're not as vocal I think you know I
[67:59] think the the the the the Twitter
[68:00] audience is skewed towards the younger
[68:03] audience because I think you are just
[68:04] better at at running the pace of Bitcoin
[68:09] Twitter we we we we are more vocal on on
[68:13] social media in general I think social
[68:15] media you think everything is younger um
[68:18] but I think the producers of social
[68:21] media content is younger and not the
[68:23] consumers uh there are a lot of
[68:26] uh um older people that just like to
[68:28] listen on a podcast and if you're
[68:31] totally honest uh you you might have
[68:33] more time also if you're older to to
[68:35] watch the podcast than when you are uh
[68:38] maybe I don't know 28 and you're just
[68:40] starting a family and you work really
[68:42] hard if you're in your pension uh you
[68:44] don't have to take care of kids and
[68:46] stuff like that you may you have maybe
[68:48] time to watch three four five podcasts
[68:51] on a day uh um so yeah uh social
[68:56] media is is giving us a bubble in a lot
[69:00] of different
[69:01] senses yeah yeah and it's hard to escape
[69:04] you know like this audience capture is
[69:07] is incredibly strong um I think
[69:10] everybody carries that audience capture
[69:13] fallacy a little
[69:14] [Music]
[69:16] um I think that you know that the big
[69:18] wins are made at the intersections and I
[69:21] think every wave has its intersections
[69:23] for me it's fascinating to you know now
[69:26] learn how deep the the options uh and
[69:30] convertible note um rabbit hole is and
[69:33] how complex the the the mathematics um
[69:38] uh around around options pricing is uh
[69:41] but you know it's it's it's the it's the
[69:43] topic of the moment understanding how
[69:45] saor does his convertibles and and and
[69:48] what it implies and and and you know
[69:51] it's there it's there are some people
[69:53] that now have their moment to shine and
[69:54] I think this is
[69:55] this is super cool because yes there are
[69:58] waves of topics where you know these
[70:00] intersections become relevant but and
[70:03] then you know the thing moves on uh the
[70:05] monster moves on but in a way people
[70:08] stay and so it just enriches the the
[70:12] community as such that there's so much
[70:14] great talent uh that you can Source from
[70:17] and and learn from and it's a super
[70:19] privilege to to be part of that
[70:21] Community absolutely really cool um we
[70:24] have one more and rtin uh of of the
[70:27] podcast where the previous guest is
[70:29] asking a question for the next guest
[70:30] without knowing who the next guest
[70:32] actually is uh and the previous guest
[70:35] asked you the question are you already
[70:38] thinking in SATs uh and uh if not why
[70:42] not that's a super interesting question
[70:45] um truth is
[70:48] I where it makes more sense I I count I
[70:52] I I I I um
[70:55] denominate in where it makes more sense
[70:58] for me so if I'm if I am thinking in you
[71:02] know covering my basic supplies I'm
[71:06] thinking in Swiss Franks or in dollars I
[71:09] this is this is almost one to one but
[71:12] when it comes to longevity and B and
[71:15] investment decisions I actually really
[71:17] think in in in in Bitcoin and you know
[71:21] if you think about buying a house and
[71:23] then you go through you know the the the
[71:26] the
[71:28] um you know you choose these different
[71:31] moments in time and you stock take how
[71:32] much a house of a given value might have
[71:35] cost it um and you see you know that the
[71:38] number of of of Bitcoin that you would
[71:41] need for it um goes down then it's
[71:44] actually a a motivation and a booster to
[71:47] to think in in in in in Bitcoin because
[71:51] it rewards you on an idea basis it
[71:54] rewards you for uh the patience and and
[71:59] uh the endurance and the resilience that
[72:01] you had and it motivates for for um um
[72:06] not spending um not spending at all yeah
[72:11] thinking in uh taking Bitcoin as the
[72:13] unit of as your own unit of account is a
[72:17] superpow I said it multiple times in the
[72:19] in in the podcast and I think it's
[72:20] really good uh perfect thank you so much
