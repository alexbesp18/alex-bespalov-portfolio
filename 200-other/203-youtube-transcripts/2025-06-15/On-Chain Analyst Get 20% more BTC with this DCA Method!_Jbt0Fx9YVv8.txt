[00:00] I want to see when the smart money's
[00:01] taking profit I don't want to buy I want
[00:02] to wait when the dumb money is's taking
[00:04] a loss now I want to buy I want to step
[00:06] in and buy that pain it helps you
[00:07] actually make your monthly DCA which by
[00:09] the way I've done for many years just
[00:11] literally paycheck in pay bills empty
[00:13] bank account all Bitcoin gone you know
[00:14] nowadays I'm a lot more strategic with
[00:17] it because I can basically see what all
[00:18] the Market's doing my paycheck comes in
[00:20] I check my metrics oh hang on bunch of
[00:22] guys are taking profit I'll wait if you
[00:24] were to buy every time it wasn't frothy
[00:26] versus every time it was frothy you're
[00:28] probably saving 20% so imagine if every
[00:30] single buy you've ever done you're
[00:32] getting 15 to 20% more bitco I can't
[00:34] tell you the amount of times I've been
[00:35] on Twitter being like yeah guys
[00:36] long-term holders are selling like no
[00:38] one sells they were all hodlers I'm like
[00:40] bro I can see it there's like massive
[00:42] amounts of realized profit instead of
[00:43] being a prediction it's more here's a
[00:45] zone of interest if we get up there we
[00:47] have to start looking for profit taking
[00:49] cuz at some point that will oversaturate
[00:51] demand and you start looking for a
[00:52] correction so the retailing Bitcoin are
[00:54] serious dudes they know exactly what
[00:56] they're doing they know exactly why
[00:58] they're buying super high conviction I
[01:00] want to be in the trenches with those
[01:01] guys gold stored my value Bitcoin grew
[01:04] my value it's actually better than a
[01:06] store of value because it's kicking ass
[01:07] it's four times better than the next
[01:09] best thing bitcoin's in this really
[01:11] interesting world where it's both small
[01:13] and large it's like a a small fish
[01:15] that's just been put into a bigger Pond
[01:16] the ETFs are between 10 and 20% of the
[01:19] total Market there's been this like
[01:21] weird assumption that now that the
[01:22] Bitcoin ETFs are here the entire Market
[01:25] infrastructure that's been around for 15
[01:27] years just gone disappeared no it's it's
[01:30] still the 90% of the market the ETFs are
[01:32] big but they're not
[01:37] dominant today's topic is a topic that I
[01:40] did not spend too much time in my in my
[01:43] learning Bitcoin Journey uh when I was
[01:46] was orange peing myself the today's
[01:49] topic is onchain analysis and I know
[01:51] like it's so great that we have this
[01:53] onchain data um but I don't really
[01:56] understand like what can we learn from
[01:58] that uh regards bit coin and then also
[02:01] other topics yeah I mean onchain data is
[02:04] is fascinating and it's one of those
[02:05] things that for one of a better term
[02:06] they don't teach you in school uh and
[02:08] this when I talk about this like you
[02:09] know we all go through our own orange
[02:11] peeling Journey but what is so
[02:13] fascinating about it is it is Bitcoin it
[02:16] is literally just the database that is
[02:18] Bitcoin right it's trans transaction
[02:20] Ledger of who owned what and when and
[02:23] you'll be very very hard pressed finding
[02:25] many of the Talking Heads like I've
[02:27] never heard Michael saor talk about
[02:29] onchain analysis once I've never heard
[02:31] most of these big Talking Heads talking
[02:32] about it even though it is Bitcoin but
[02:35] more importantly if we take it like
[02:36] another level what is why is this like
[02:38] onchain data important it's us it's all
[02:41] of the buying the selling the holding
[02:43] the Distributing all those behaviors and
[02:45] those actions we print those those
[02:48] metrics and you know ultimately it's
[02:50] about looking at how long people have
[02:51] held it how much of the supply is held
[02:53] by these long-term holders when do they
[02:55] start selling who are they selling to
[02:57] how do those people who they bought it
[02:58] how do they behave and ultimately it's
[03:01] just behavioral economics and Bitcoin
[03:03] because of its very organic nature it
[03:06] just moves coins from A to B A lot of
[03:08] those coins are going in and out of
[03:10] exchanges and it tells us about how much
[03:12] profit people are in when they're taking
[03:13] it when they're like they bought high
[03:15] and they sold low when they bought low
[03:17] and they sold high and we can just
[03:18] extract these really interesting and
[03:21] quite frankly very reliable patterns of
[03:23] human beings buying tops selling bottoms
[03:26] smart money buying bottoms and selling
[03:28] tops right you can see all of these
[03:30] patterns and ultimately that's what it's
[03:32] all about what can we learn from Human
[03:34] psychology like we we always he that
[03:36] like all like most people buy the top
[03:39] and then sell in the panic and I see it
[03:41] also with with some of my friends
[03:43] unfortunately sometimes like the FR
[03:45] group outside that the outside of the
[03:47] Bitcoin group what do you see see there
[03:49] and and what is Smart money doing yeah
[03:53] it's more or less the the one big
[03:55] takeaway that I've learned from onchain
[03:57] data and to be honest and from markets
[03:58] in general
[04:00] the interest rates can change J Pal's
[04:02] mood can change right the stock market
[04:04] levels can change the one thing that
[04:05] will never change is human beings making
[04:08] decisions at the wrong time at the exact
[04:11] wrong point because of their emotional
[04:13] state it's why price chart in the 1920s
[04:16] look exactly the same as they do at any
[04:18] other point in time because we have this
[04:20] like innate desire to feel like we're
[04:23] we're part of a herb and we always want
[04:25] to feel good right when you buy an asset
[04:28] you don't want to be the first man to to
[04:29] do it you want to be like you know kind
[04:31] of in the crowd you want to let someone
[04:33] else jump off the cliff first and make
[04:34] sure it's safe and we're like
[04:36] conditioned from a very early age to
[04:37] avoid risk and markets are
[04:40] counterintuitively full of risk like
[04:42] they're all risk and you have to accept
[04:44] it but human beings don't usually go
[04:46] through that process right it takes time
[04:48] to really become interested in markets
[04:51] you mention you've got friends who
[04:52] aren't that interested in Bitcoin I'm
[04:53] the much the same I would say probably a
[04:56] very similar cohort probably a little
[04:58] bit bigger but your circle of friends
[05:00] most of them probably aren't interested
[05:01] in markets either right they've got
[05:03] other that they're doing in their
[05:04] life and that subset of people who are
[05:06] interested in markets an even smaller
[05:09] subset of them understand Bitcoin and an
[05:11] even smaller subset of that understands
[05:14] themselves in a market and that's I
[05:17] think the most important thing what does
[05:19] onchain data tell you tells you what
[05:21] everyone else is doing and when you can
[05:23] see what everyone else is doing and you
[05:25] can kind of do the opposite strangely
[05:27] enough that's usually a very good tactic
[05:29] so I look at myself back in 2018 when I
[05:31] got into this Market I bought High it
[05:34] sold off I was like what do I do I
[05:36] know I'll sell now and I'll buy back
[05:38] lower and now that I go back and look at
[05:40] all my decisions back in 2018 I can see
[05:43] that I sold the bottom right before it
[05:44] ripped and then I got excited I bought
[05:46] the high right before it dipped and you
[05:48] can see your old Behavior patterns in
[05:51] the onchain data you're like wow I was
[05:53] the idiot and you can like see it now so
[05:55] what do I want to do I want to do the
[05:56] opposite of idiot me and use those
[05:58] metrics to do the ex exact opposite and
[06:00] try and make better decisions along the
[06:02] way
[06:03] have a work colleague an old work
[06:06] colleague of mine that perfectly timed
[06:08] to top like he literally like bought the
[06:11] day where the top was in the Euro so I
[06:14] and since then he's really disappointed
[06:15] with Bitcoin but I I I said to him like
[06:18] tell me when you buy again then I will
[06:20] sell some yeah um strangely enough I did
[06:22] the exact same so I bought the exact top
[06:24] in 2017 and it was actually so bad you
[06:27] could not have bought higher than me
[06:29] because at the top tick of the candle
[06:31] when I was doing my taxes back in 2018
[06:33] or 19 whatever it was and I looked at my
[06:36] taxes and basically my purchase price
[06:39] because coinbase had an extra fee for
[06:41] Australian dollars back then you
[06:43] actually add the premium on top and I'm
[06:44] like above the top tick of the candle
[06:46] I'm like I mean you couldn't have done
[06:48] it better than me and that was the first
[06:49] thing I ever bought I'd never bought a
[06:51] stock I'd never owned anything before in
[06:53] my life buying Bitcoin at the absolute
[06:55] top in 2017 was the the first thing I
[06:57] ever purchased and you know I learned
[07:00] that lesson you pay your tuition in that
[07:01] bare Market I turned 10 grand into 10
[07:04] cents but that Journey taught me so much
[07:07] about like okay something about this
[07:09] Market thing is fascinating and I need
[07:11] to learn more about it then I found
[07:13] onchain data and like markets are a
[07:15] process and like you're constantly
[07:17] learning you never know the answer but
[07:19] ultimately you're trading against
[07:20] yourself you need to make decisions you
[07:22] can't change the tide markets just are
[07:25] all you can do is make your decisions
[07:27] based on the stimulus and information
[07:29] the market gives you I love that a lot I
[07:32] mean I learned it a little bit before
[07:33] like I learned it before Bitcoin because
[07:35] I was in Tesla and there was some
[07:36] lessons in there for me uh but I I
[07:39] really I really like bought into like
[07:41] the the selling off like I was that was
[07:43] one year 50% decrease in the Tesla stock
[07:47] and I just saw that the business was
[07:48] growing actually and I was like the
[07:51] stock getting cheaper and the business
[07:53] growing like ah I need to buy more that
[07:56] was a hard lesson for me but it uh was
[07:58] really getting is really was good for me
[08:01] in Bitcoin um the one question for me is
[08:03] like on onchain data can you label smart
[08:08] versus smart money versus dumb money
[08:11] where you're like okay that that's kind
[08:12] of the the smart money addresses and
[08:15] those like kind of the D Money addresses
[08:17] and then following that if you can label
[08:20] that can you even predict some trades
[08:22] there and can you make like a weighted
[08:24] DCA or something like that I mean I am
[08:26] not Trad like I'm just buying anytime I
[08:29] have money like anytime money comes in I
[08:31] buy because I know otherwise emotionally
[08:34] I'm not prepared for anything like that
[08:36] so I'm just saving myself the trouble
[08:38] and like when money comes in I buy
[08:40] Bitcoin with whatever amount I have but
[08:44] if uh that's possible um do you think
[08:47] that that would be actually possible
[08:49] labeling smart money and then using that
[08:51] information to make future trades yeah
[08:53] it's a great question so when a lot of
[08:54] people think about onchain data they
[08:56] think uh complexity like data sleuths in
[08:58] there you know going to follow this
[09:00] guy's wallet and oh wait this whale is
[09:01] doing something I actually recommend do
[09:04] the exact opposite of that and all that
[09:06] is whenever you see somebody
[09:07] who's like oh look watch out for Mr 100
[09:09] or watch out for this whale ignore it
[09:12] it's complete noise it's going to give
[09:13] you no Alpha whatsoever um when I think
[09:16] about onchain data i' I I've got like
[09:18] this framework idea you'll find on my
[09:19] website it's like a like a grid so if
[09:21] you imagine the whole Bitcoin Supply
[09:23] it's just like a big block and we're
[09:25] going to divide up that supply all 21
[09:27] million coins divide it up into who owns
[09:29] it how long they've held it is it in
[09:31] profit is it in loss is it being spent
[09:33] is it being held so there's three axes
[09:36] and they're all perpendicular to each
[09:37] other right XY Z on the xaxis you've got
[09:41] the coins are they moving or are they
[09:43] not moving and on any one day about one%
[09:45] of the supply gets transacted so you got
[09:47] you know 19.7 million coins and then a
[09:50] small fraction of those that are
[09:51] actually on the Move each day so in
[09:53] motion or stationary the second axis in
[09:56] profit in loss and you can probably
[09:59] already see just from those two axes
[10:00] you've got the amount of Supply that's
[10:02] held in profit the amount of Supply
[10:03] that's held in loss the amount of Supply
[10:05] that's moving or the volume in profit
[10:08] volume in loss and then the last axis
[10:10] gets onto your your question about you
[10:12] know how do you track these people
[10:14] that's what I call the coort axis and
[10:16] this is where stuff really gets quite
[10:18] Magic on that Zed axis the question is
[10:21] okay how do we group those coins that
[10:23] are in profit that are volume in loss
[10:25] how do we group that XY plane by indiv
[10:29] individual right not not not like
[10:31] tracking the individual guy I want to
[10:33] see bundles of people who exhibit the
[10:35] same behavior so one example of a cohort
[10:39] show me all the shrimp show me all the
[10:41] shrimp who were in profit that's an
[10:43] interesting metric show me all of the
[10:45] whales and exchanges who are in loss
[10:48] right you can do all sorts of things but
[10:49] the cohort that really matters and what
[10:51] you'll see a lot of people talking about
[10:53] and honestly you don't need to learn any
[10:55] of the other ones it's long-term holder
[10:57] short-term holder and ultimately we
[10:59] about a five Monon window when you've
[11:01] held your coins or a coin's been dormant
[11:02] for five months it usually stays dormant
[11:05] right now that's in one exception during
[11:08] bull markets those old coins six months
[11:11] one year two year they all come back
[11:14] into circulation and get spent as the
[11:16] market rips higher so most of the time
[11:20] most coins do not move when they get to
[11:22] long-term hold of status the best way to
[11:24] think about that they're the smart money
[11:26] that people who buy in a bear they wait
[11:28] and they wait and they wait and then
[11:31] they finally take profits when the
[11:33] market really rips higher so if you're
[11:36] an investor I want to do two things I
[11:38] want to buy my Bitcoin when they're not
[11:40] selling right if long-term holders are
[11:42] selling I don't want to buy because the
[11:44] smart money is exiting why would don't
[11:45] want to buy at that point and likewise I
[11:48] want to wait when the dumb money sells
[11:50] at a loss the people who buy High you
[11:53] kind of want to step in and buy when
[11:55] they sell at a loss so you can use this
[11:57] like are the coins moving are they not
[11:59] are they in profit are they not who
[12:01] right by long or short term now I've got
[12:04] a really good framework to actually take
[12:06] an x-ray of the market and I can see I
[12:09] want to see when the smart money's
[12:10] taking profit I don't want to buy I want
[12:12] to wait when the dumb money's taking a
[12:14] loss now I want to buy I want to step in
[12:16] and buy that pain so it helps you
[12:18] actually make your monthly DCA which by
[12:20] the way I've done for many years just
[12:21] literally paycheck in pay bills empty
[12:24] bank account all Bitcoin gone and you
[12:26] know nowadays I'm a lot more iic with it
[12:29] because I can basically see what all the
[12:31] Market's doing my paycheck comes in I
[12:33] check my metrics oh hang on bunch of
[12:35] guys are taking profit all wait and of
[12:38] course the market will always sell off
[12:40] at some point there we go that's my
[12:43] signal now I'll buy and I get more SATs
[12:45] for my dollar and that's really how I
[12:46] think about a lot of this
[12:48] stuff so basically a a weighted DCA
[12:52] where you like go into sometimes a
[12:54] little heavier in or sometimes you uh
[12:57] don't go heavier in but you don't use it
[12:58] as like selling Bitcoin correct correct
[13:02] I basically if I'm going to buy my
[13:04] Bitcoin and I get paid on the 15th for
[13:06] example of every month I I'm just going
[13:08] to make sure that on that particular
[13:10] 15th I'm not going to getting sold on
[13:11] because I there's nothing worse we've
[13:13] all done it hundreds of times you buy
[13:15] and like the moment you've hit the green
[13:17] button the price just sells off 10%
[13:19] you're like really really right now
[13:21] I couldn't have waited like 10 minutes
[13:23] but of course if you look at the the
[13:24] onchain down you go well there's a bunch
[13:26] of guys selling the probability that
[13:27] that red candle is coming
[13:29] I'll wait because when that red candle
[13:31] comes at least now I was kind of
[13:32] semi-prepared for it and then I buy at
[13:34] the bottom not the top of that that
[13:35] candle it's not about picking like you
[13:37] know Ultra in the weeds I'm just saying
[13:40] if I've got a monthly DCA I want to buy
[13:42] the best time I can possibly find over
[13:44] the course of that month how much better
[13:47] do you think uh that strategy could
[13:50] perform if you really look at the onent
[13:51] data and you know what you're looking at
[13:53] uh and you anyways just buy Bitcoin you
[13:57] never sell like you you have most of
[13:58] your wealth in there but you are careful
[14:00] with the timing of buying within a
[14:03] specific month how much better of a
[14:06] performance do you think you can end up
[14:08] in like a five year or 10 year uh window
[14:11] that's a great question so I actually
[14:12] haven't done any of those specific
[14:14] studies but what I can say is that we
[14:16] started up the the check on chain
[14:17] newslet that we're doing at the moment
[14:19] um we started that up in April so the
[14:21] the all-time high the 73k is already
[14:23] been set and we've kind of had the first
[14:25] sell off now over the course of writing
[14:28] the newsletter for the last five months
[14:29] there's been three events where I've
[14:31] released a a news that it's it's been
[14:33] some iteration of this is what I think
[14:36] about the dip and it's usually one of
[14:38] the advantages of being an Australian by
[14:40] the way is that when the Americans when
[14:41] the Market's selling off and all the
[14:43] Americans go to bed I've got a whole day
[14:45] to create content and produce a
[14:46] newsletter so when they wake up bright
[14:47] and early in the morning it's there for
[14:49] them um so there's been three instances
[14:52] where we've had these really big like
[14:54] waterfall nasty sell-offs that only
[14:56] Australians are awake for and we I I
[14:59] think get to analyze it make a video and
[15:01] actually understand what's going on
[15:02] there and the way I kind of frame it for
[15:04] my Subs is I think the first one was at
[15:07] 56k the second one was at 53 and then it
[15:10] was during that August 5th selloff where
[15:12] you know granted it was only down to the
[15:13] 40 49 or whatever it was for um you know
[15:16] two hours or three hours or something
[15:17] but in that kind of $50,000 window so 56
[15:20] 53 and 50 the amount of messages that
[15:23] I've had from people going like man I I
[15:26] wish that I had have like looked at
[15:28] those metrics and gone damn I would love
[15:29] to buy at 56 53 and 50 even if the
[15:33] market just imagine even if the market
[15:34] goes to 30 maybe like the the the world
[15:37] just wants the price to go to 30k for
[15:39] whatever reason I would rather have
[15:41] bought my coin at 56 53 and 50 and then
[15:45] it goes to 30 then all the other guys
[15:47] who are like man I got coins at 60 and
[15:49] 73 and 70 like I thought I was really
[15:52] excited so if you just look at the Delta
[15:55] between the level where people were
[15:57] taking profit versus when people were
[15:59] capitulating sure you may still see some
[16:02] of your coins go underwater that's kind
[16:04] of expected in markets but I'm not down
[16:07] 30% I'm down five or 10 right so
[16:11] suddenly you're like I can actually in
[16:13] Bitcoin who cares about a 10% down we do
[16:15] with this all the time but when
[16:16] you're down 30% that's when like your
[16:19] emotional State's like oh that feels
[16:21] really bad and that's what makes it hard
[16:23] to huddle when you buy at the wrong time
[16:26] and you've got to carry this really
[16:28] heavy bag that's what actually like
[16:30] wears down your stress levels and all
[16:33] these things so ultimately if you're
[16:35] just trying to lower that cost basis
[16:38] you're gonna do much better it's gonna
[16:40] be so much easier to actually navigate
[16:42] these markets that's interesting do we
[16:45] have um for someone that is not an
[16:48] expert like me for someone who just
[16:50] holds and wants to still get a little
[16:53] bit in in onchain data do you have
[16:54] resources where like okay there I can
[16:56] look I heard something class notes like
[16:59] those kind of websites I I looked on
[17:01] there sometimes um where we can actually
[17:03] look at those metrics and maybe even um
[17:06] how we make an informed decision of like
[17:08] okay now it's a little bit of a worse
[17:11] time to to buy maybe I should wait like
[17:13] half a month a month to to buy in and
[17:15] maybe then it's better yeah absolutely I
[17:18] mean we've got two right the the
[17:19] newsletter we do is literally two pieces
[17:21] of content a week to help people do this
[17:22] and one of those which interestingly
[17:24] enough we just did a survey of all of
[17:25] our subscribers and um I always knew
[17:28] that the master class like actually
[17:29] telling people this is how to interpret
[17:31] these metrics and how like really really
[17:33] giving people a proper course on how to
[17:35] understand this stuff I knew there was
[17:37] demand for it I didn't realize there was
[17:39] this much demand for it people love it
[17:40] and that's fantastic because like a lot
[17:42] of people really want to learn these
[17:43] tools and honestly for the vast majority
[17:46] of hodlers you only have to learn two
[17:48] metrics once you go down that rabbit
[17:50] hole you'll find there's a whole bunch
[17:51] of other things just like Bitcoin you'll
[17:53] be like oh cool I want to pick this up
[17:54] and play with this um but really if you
[17:56] can learn mvrv and the variant of it
[17:59] short-term holder mvrv primarily and
[18:01] there's another one called soapr it's
[18:04] literally the system metric mvrv shows
[18:06] you how in profit the market is so if
[18:09] it's at two it means the Market's up 2x
[18:11] on average if it's at 0.8 the Market's
[18:13] down
[18:14] 20% um so mvrv is the held coins what's
[18:18] their profit and loss soapa is the spent
[18:21] coins are people locking in a 5% a 10% a
[18:24] 20% 30% profit what's the average profit
[18:26] being locked in or loss those two
[18:29] metrics is all you need if you learn
[18:32] short-term mvrv and short-term soapa you
[18:35] don't need anything else they are the
[18:36] hodler's best friend um they tell you
[18:38] just about everything you can tell when
[18:39] it's a bare Market you can tell when
[18:41] it's a bull you can tell when it's a
[18:42] capitulation you can tell when it's a
[18:45] Euphoria Wick that you shouldn't be
[18:46] getting anywhere near you you can tell
[18:49] all of this purely from those two
[18:51] metrics so we try to do a master class
[18:52] but then um you can head over to charts.
[18:55] checkon chain.com and we've got a whole
[18:57] Suite every every met you could ever
[18:59] want is is completely free over there
[19:01] we've got all these tools um so that's
[19:03] really the for me onchain data is
[19:05] Bitcoin bitcoin's open source I love
[19:08] making this stuff open source and that's
[19:10] ultimately what this is all about for me
[19:11] so making the data nice and free and uh
[19:13] available for
[19:14] everyone it's really like those two
[19:17] metrics if I understand it correctly the
[19:19] one is like unrealized gains what the
[19:21] market has and realized gains what the
[19:23] market has correct it's exactly what
[19:25] they are yep okay that's that's an
[19:27] really interesting uh thing to look at
[19:29] like because of of course if the
[19:30] unrealized gains are minus this means
[19:33] like we're in a bare market and it's
[19:35] probably a good time to buy and if we uh
[19:38] in in a poll Market where the unrealized
[19:41] gains are high then it's probably like a
[19:43] time where you can maybe make a little
[19:46] bit of of a a feat cushion and maybe buy
[19:48] later a little bit that's an interesting
[19:50] absolutely no that that and that is that
[19:52] is literally as easy as it gets so every
[19:54] time you go for your DCA check
[19:56] short-term mvrv if it's really high and
[19:59] shortterm so is really high just wait if
[20:02] it comes back down and you'll see that
[20:04] both of these metrics tend to like
[20:05] bounce along one one is the break even
[20:08] level and they'll bounce along there and
[20:10] like buying as close to one as you can
[20:11] in a bull is thumbs up if you get those
[20:14] levels below one in a that's when you're
[20:16] getting like you know it could be a bear
[20:19] but also the bottom of a dip looks
[20:21] exactly the same as the start of a bear
[20:22] so you kind of can you know Frame It Up
[20:24] be like you just want both of those
[20:26] metrics as low as possible because it
[20:28] showing you the market is not frothy and
[20:31] ultimately for a hodler if you're here
[20:33] for the long term if you were to buy
[20:35] every time it wasn't frothy versus every
[20:37] time it was frothy you're probably
[20:39] saving 20% because what's a bitcoin
[20:41] correction 20 odd percent thereabouts so
[20:43] imagine if every single buy you've ever
[20:45] done you're getting 15 to 20% more
[20:48] Bitcoin every single time right that's
[20:50] the compound of Return of just looking
[20:53] at two metrics just before you do your
[20:55] DCA that's amazing really cool side um
[20:59] can you make also or do you also make
[21:02] long-term price predictions based on
[21:04] that when you see the past like five 10
[21:07] years of of Bitcoin history on onchain
[21:09] and with the Bitcoin price and then
[21:11] extrapolate that out like 5 10 20 years
[21:14] yeah so I you actually will probably
[21:16] never get a price prediction out of me
[21:18] because I don't think they're useful
[21:19] because at the end of the day who knows
[21:21] the Market's going to do whatever it
[21:22] does um one of my favorite kind of
[21:25] personal Journeys or lessons I guess you
[21:27] call it is came AC there was one time
[21:29] when I just realized I don't know and no
[21:32] one knows right the market over the next
[21:34] 10 minutes it's literally a coin flip
[21:36] flip a coin who knows where it's going
[21:37] to go um over the and and actually I did
[21:40] a study I think it was yesterday or two
[21:42] days ago and I literally looked at the
[21:44] distribution of price returns right on a
[21:46] one day what's the are we up five are we
[21:48] down three what's the percent
[21:50] distributions I think it was 48% of the
[21:53] time we're down and 52 no it was 52% of
[21:56] the time we're down 48% of the time
[21:57] we're up so on any particular day
[21:59] there's literally a coin flip whether
[22:00] we're going to be higher or lower like
[22:02] it's quite literally just how it trades
[22:05] now obviously there's more down dayss in
[22:06] a bear and more up dayss in a bull um I
[22:09] don't do price predictions because I
[22:10] don't think they're useful a lot of
[22:11] people love them right power laws and
[22:14] stock to flows I I just think that
[22:16] that's misleading because there's no
[22:18] reason for those to work there's no
[22:20] gravity there it's just like purely a
[22:21] meme and people who kind of don't know
[22:24] better get hooked on this stuff what I
[22:27] do do however
[22:29] is we know that people like people do
[22:31] sell that's just reality of it right um
[22:33] we can see it and I can't to the amount
[22:35] of times I've been on Twitter being like
[22:36] yeah guys like long-term holders are
[22:38] selling like no one sells they were all
[22:40] hodlers and I'm like bro I can see it
[22:42] there's like massive amounts of realized
[22:44] profit and of course this is going to be
[22:46] at the top right there's gonna be a
[22:47] whole bunch of selling going on at the
[22:49] top and everyone just can't believe it
[22:50] people do sell so um what we look for
[22:54] show me when mvrv right unrealized
[22:57] profit show me when the paper gains are
[22:59] going to be
[23:00] 300% because historically speaking when
[23:03] it gets to 300% people start to sell
[23:06] right I can look at the onchain data of
[23:07] the past I can look at the onchain data
[23:09] today and say well are we seeing a price
[23:12] level what price do we have to get to
[23:14] for mvrv to go to three because once it
[23:17] gets there my expectation is based on
[23:19] every single previous time it's done
[23:20] that guys start to sell so rather than a
[23:23] price prediction I can look at what
[23:25] price will investor Behavior change
[23:28] that's the way I like to think about it
[23:29] so instead of being a prediction it's
[23:32] more here's a zone of interest if we get
[23:34] up there we have to start looking for
[23:37] profit taking because at some point that
[23:39] will oversaturate demand and you start
[23:40] looking for a correction right so you
[23:42] start making making adjustments to your
[23:43] portfolio
[23:45] accordingly interesting um how do you
[23:48] actually track the the data of someone's
[23:51] selling because it's like um onchain I
[23:54] mean obviously we know the ones of
[23:56] exchanges so those are kind of um more
[23:59] seeable I guess when someone moves from
[24:01] C Storage to The Exchange but if someone
[24:03] for example actually spends the Bitcoin
[24:06] and for example they have one Bitcoin
[24:08] and all of the sudden uh 10 million
[24:10] Sates of that are moving to another
[24:12] address that could be because he wants
[24:14] to start diversifying his one Bitcoin on
[24:17] different Cold Storage Solutions or it
[24:19] could be because he sent some satosi to
[24:21] someone else because he bought a service
[24:23] or something like that do you have a way
[24:25] to differentiate that uh or because
[24:28] maybe those Bitcoin are still in his uh
[24:30] control and he's he's hodling but in in
[24:33] a different solution no that's that's a
[24:36] fantastic question and the truth to this
[24:37] is no I don't filter for it and uh I've
[24:40] gone through I mean I I've spent a lot
[24:42] of time with this data I spent a lot of
[24:44] time with very proprietary tools that do
[24:47] filter for it and as with everything in
[24:49] life there's trade-offs so the process
[24:51] of filtering out things like exchanges
[24:53] and self spends and all of that um what
[24:56] it does require is the data is always
[24:59] changing because a wallet that doesn't
[25:02] look like binance today could be binance
[25:04] tomorrow and you're like oh actually I
[25:06] got to not only that you need a whole
[25:08] team of people working 24 hours to try
[25:11] and track all these what they're
[25:12] constantly changing every single day
[25:15] these heuristics and patterns and all
[25:16] this stuff changes now I ran as a result
[25:19] of this I ran a bunch of studies where
[25:20] I'm like okay let's look at the filter
[25:22] data which is very expensive to create
[25:25] let's look at the non-filter data and
[25:27] for my my style of analysis I don't care
[25:30] about intraday stuff I'm not doing
[25:31] algorithmic trading I'm really just
[25:33] looking at like using my experience
[25:36] understanding how this Market Works to
[25:38] make you know on on a daily time frame
[25:40] you don't need higher resolution than
[25:41] that so I'm looking at this data within
[25:43] my context and how I analyze markets and
[25:46] I found that there's about 85 to 90% of
[25:49] the signal in the unfiltered data and I
[25:51] spent a lot of time thinking about this
[25:53] and like ultimately if you're doing a
[25:55] wallet
[25:56] consolidation for the vast major of
[25:58] people listening to this and if this
[26:00] doesn't apply to you congratulations the
[26:02] amount of Bitcoin you have and moving
[26:04] around is just not big enough to matter
[26:06] right congratulations if that doesn't
[26:08] apply to you um but the vast majority of
[26:10] us we you know we're just a fraction of
[26:11] a fraction of a fraction of a fraction
[26:13] of nothing and at the end of the day the
[26:15] error bars around me moving from one
[26:17] cold to another yeah it's an error bar
[26:20] but it just gets absorbed in the total
[26:22] noise and what we find is that we don't
[26:25] have like one day where every single
[26:27] person does utxo management one guy does
[26:30] it on Tuesday one guy does it next
[26:31] Thursday like we're all kind of so it's
[26:33] like this like Bas load of error that's
[26:35] just always there what we do see is that
[26:38] when the market is ripping to the upside
[26:41] every man in his dog is cracking out the
[26:43] cold card and saying I got to take 10%
[26:45] off the top I have to sell some and
[26:47] likewise when we get down to Bare Market
[26:48] flaw one of my favorite things whenever
[26:51] I make content that's like near the
[26:53] capitulation bottom when it's like
[26:54] finally at the end I'll look at realize
[26:57] loss and you'll see this m massive Spike
[26:59] where people bought high and they sold
[27:00] low and a lot of these guys in a bare
[27:02] Market they buy the absolute top and
[27:05] they huddle and they huddle and they
[27:07] grit their teeth and then we get to the
[27:09] absolute bottom FTX blows up and they
[27:11] sell everything and that's of course the
[27:13] perfect capitulation signal and without
[27:15] fail my comments will be full of guys
[27:18] being like no bro it's just tax lost
[27:19] harvesting and I just like I'm like you
[27:22] don't tax lost harvest in a bull do you
[27:24] it's like the same behavior thing that
[27:26] we all do at the bottom of a bear so
[27:30] even if it is tax loss harvesting it's a
[27:32] very consistent behavior and we don't
[27:34] worry about the Baseline we worry about
[27:36] the deviations from the Baseline show me
[27:38] when realized profit is screaming higher
[27:40] or realized loss is screaming higher
[27:42] that's information so that's how I would
[27:45] kind of address that is that the
[27:46] filtering you can do it for the vast
[27:49] majority of people you're probably not
[27:51] going to get much signal from it and
[27:52] I've spent so much time with this data
[27:54] that you can deal with these error bars
[27:57] just by knowing what you at right so
[27:58] when Mount gox does something and I see
[28:00] a big spike everyone's like holy
[28:02] look at all these coin days destroyed
[28:04] I'm like it's Mount just ignore it so
[28:06] you can like overlay your experience to
[28:09] deal with a lot of these these error
[28:10] bars as
[28:11] well um maybe I'm I'm not native to
[28:14] English so uh maybe that's just a stupid
[28:17] question but what is tax loss harvesting
[28:20] ah good question so the idea is and it
[28:22] depends where you live in the world but
[28:24] let's say you bought an asset at $100
[28:25] and it's trading at 50 you you can sell
[28:28] it at 50 and then buy it back at 50
[28:31] right and the idea is that you've locked
[28:33] in a $50 loss which you can remove from
[28:36] your like it depends where you live but
[28:39] um quite often tax jurisdictions they'll
[28:41] allow you to write that off as a loss so
[28:43] it kind of cuts out your let's say you
[28:45] made $200 on another stock that $50 gets
[28:49] taken off your profit so you've kind of
[28:51] made 150 rather than 200 so a lot of
[28:53] people do this a lot of Institutions
[28:55] will do this they take their losses and
[28:58] they lock them in but sometimes they re
[29:00] the asset but they've kind of locked in
[29:02] that loss which reduces their taxable
[29:05] income so it's called harvesting a tax
[29:09] loss yeah that's an interesting tactic I
[29:12] never thought about that I mean it it
[29:14] doesn't apply for me because I'm in the
[29:16] in in a lucky situation where I bought
[29:19] Bitcoin before
[29:21] 2021 and in bit in Austria the law I
[29:24] mean probably doesn't apply to everyone
[29:26] but in Austria the law is like if buy
[29:28] Bitcoin for before 2021 in February or
[29:31] something like that you don't have to
[29:32] pay uh C gains like
[29:35] zero after after that you have to pay
[29:38] and then also is also the law uh from
[29:40] your stack the first one you bought is
[29:42] also the first one you selling
[29:45] again so it's forced to be first in last
[29:48] first in first out yeah exactly and
[29:50] that's that's great so like I I if I
[29:54] ever sell as a so I did not sell until
[29:57] now if
[29:58] actually have don't have uh C gains but
[30:01] that's an interesting thing tax loss
[30:03] harvesting I never heard of yeah it's
[30:04] very common um it's very certainly I
[30:06] know in Australia you can do it um us
[30:09] definitely so yeah it's again it it's
[30:11] one of those Niche things that all the
[30:13] reply guys like no bro it's tax lost
[30:15] harvesting I'm like some people in the
[30:16] world don't even know what that is come
[30:17] on if you watch my podcast already for
[30:20] more than two times you know how
[30:22] extremely passionate I am about self-
[30:25] custody and the first very very very
[30:28] important step to self cust is always
[30:31] getting yourself a hardware wallet and I
[30:34] have one for you here this is the
[30:36] Bitcoin only Edition from the bitbox my
[30:40] favorite single signature Hardware
[30:42] wallet on the market another really
[30:44] important piece of self- custody if you
[30:47] have a hardware wallet is the backup of
[30:50] the seat phrase and bitbox made the
[30:52] perfect solution to back up your seat
[30:55] phrase they made a reusable Steel wallet
[30:58] check out that beauty it's durable and
[31:01] extremely heavy if I put it on the desk
[31:04] I seriously feel for my own table it's
[31:07] so so heavy and durable I love it this
[31:10] is where my seed phrase is secure go to
[31:14] bitbox
[31:15] Doss robobin to get your bitbox and if
[31:19] you use code Robin you even get 5% off
[31:24] of your complete order and the next step
[31:26] is to really level up your sovereignty
[31:29] as an individual you have to have the
[31:31] most secure self- custody setup you have
[31:34] to secure your own devices you have to
[31:37] protect your privacy you have to set up
[31:40] an inheritance plan and depending on
[31:42] where you live you even want to have a
[31:45] plan B a citizenship where you can move
[31:48] in case something goes really really
[31:49] wrong and through all those steps the
[31:51] Bitcoin way is guiding you through step
[31:54] by step and if you visit the Bitcoin
[31:57] way.com /p Partners robobin you even get
[32:01] a 30 minute free call to find out how
[32:04] you can level up your sovereignty and
[32:07] last but not least I have something
[32:09] completely new for you guys I partnered
[32:12] up with coin vigilante this is the most
[32:15] beautiful Bitcoin time piece that I ever
[32:18] saw created by anyone look at that
[32:21] beauty I love it so much coin vigilante
[32:24] made a perfect Bitcoin watch that's the
[32:27] perfect subtle elegent way to go out
[32:30] there and show that you are a bitcoiner
[32:32] and that watch brand is Bitcoin only and
[32:36] coin vigilante just dropped a completely
[32:39] new and amazing Genesis edition of their
[32:43] watch collections you have the date of
[32:45] the first ever mined Bitcoin Block in
[32:48] there and of course also the block
[32:50] height and which EPO we are currently in
[32:54] I love the level of detail they put in
[32:57] in this map Masterpiece and make sure to
[32:59] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[33:02] time pieces down in the descriptions I
[33:05] love those watches so so much yeah it's
[33:08] it's it's also possible in Austria I
[33:10] know about it because I did a lot of
[33:12] stocks before uh but I never knew that
[33:14] the technique because of course if you
[33:17] get in a loss and then just buy it again
[33:20] uh that's a interesting strategy yeah I
[33:23] mean some countries have different rules
[33:24] where it has to be like a month between
[33:26] the there's a whole lot of stuff there
[33:28] that's just Nuance absolutely yeah
[33:30] perfect then but you brought up one
[33:32] interesting question because I think
[33:34] most people
[33:36] overestimate what the average Bitcoin
[33:39] holdes on
[33:40] bitcoin I the average Bitcoin holds like
[33:45] very little amount of of Bitcoin um
[33:48] maybe those who are really engaged in
[33:50] Bitcoin community and like uh like
[33:53] speaking about it and doing a lot of
[33:55] stuff in Bitcoin maybe that average is
[33:57] higher but the overall average of people
[34:00] holding Bitcoin that's not high do you
[34:03] have a number with like that's the
[34:05] average bitcoiner having as as how many
[34:09] Sates is that and also do you have make
[34:12] a difference between uh engaged people
[34:15] and long-term people and people that are
[34:18] shortterm in the market and and
[34:20] long-term in the market uh different
[34:22] statistics for that yeah so I don't I
[34:24] don't have very um spe uh specific stats
[34:27] on it what I can say is that uh when you
[34:29] look at retail um now retail
[34:32] historically has been you know in any
[34:34] kind of asset if you're an institution
[34:36] you're there to take money off retail
[34:38] because they generally represent the
[34:40] dumb money and they often consider them
[34:41] one and the same bitcoin's a little bit
[34:44] different um in altcoins absolutely the
[34:46] retail is absolutely the dumb money when
[34:48] you look at Bitcoin it has a very unique
[34:51] property where I know I just like lump
[34:54] everyone together everyone's got under
[34:55] 10 BTC and the reason for this
[34:58] when you take everyone who's got under
[34:59] 10 Bitcoin that is still retail because
[35:02] you know if you go back five years 10
[35:05] Bitcoin was acquirable for many people
[35:06] right you know if it's trading at $2,000
[35:08] 3,000 people could actually legitimately
[35:10] buy that without too much of hassle bit
[35:13] harder today so there's kind of that
[35:15] side of the equation but there's also um
[35:18] if you've been a hodler for a long time
[35:20] you may have 10 Bitcoin because you've
[35:22] accumulated 0.1.1 .1 and you've just
[35:25] done this for years and years and years
[35:26] just kept chipping away out
[35:28] right over time you you accumulate less
[35:30] but it's one of these things that that's
[35:31] probably about the boundary where retail
[35:33] sits and what we see consistently now
[35:36] it's not perfect but we see I look at
[35:38] like a 30-day change of this like retail
[35:41] size wallets and if you look at a 30-day
[35:44] change they tend to sell tops and they
[35:47] tend to buy heavily at bottoms and one
[35:50] of my favorite insights I've got a
[35:52] version of this chart on my website
[35:54] there was the the biggest by far like
[35:57] not even close
[35:58] in history was the 2017 top and that was
[36:01] me right that was literally me being an
[36:02] idiot buying the absolute top it was
[36:04] just a huge wave of buying and then it
[36:07] created these people got wiped out and I
[36:10] know because I lived through it you get
[36:11] this bare market and then we never got
[36:13] even remotely close to that top for
[36:16] years when we re we actually blew that
[36:19] level out when three arrows blew up and
[36:22] then when FTX blew up so just think
[36:24] about the psychology of that I
[36:27] understand why bought in 2017 because
[36:28] that was me I was very excited and
[36:30] bitcoin's going to change the world I'm
[36:31] going to be rich right that was the
[36:33] wrong decision but then they waited for
[36:36] five years and then they bought to the
[36:39] same scale in a raging bare Market the
[36:42] most horrific bar market we've seen a
[36:43] very long time exchanges are blowing up
[36:46] companies are going bankrupt wild stuff
[36:50] and that's when they bought and you
[36:51] think about it's like well what was my
[36:53] journey I listen to countless hours of
[36:56] podcasts I read countless books over
[36:58] that period my conviction from 2017 to
[37:01] 2022 I also bought like crazy and I was
[37:04] like my God these guys are geniuses they
[37:07] are the hardest people in this market so
[37:10] the retailing Bitcoin are serious dudes
[37:12] they know exactly what they're doing
[37:14] they know exactly why they're buying
[37:17] super high conviction I want to be in
[37:18] the trenches with those guys so Bitcoin
[37:20] is a very interesting asset where retail
[37:22] isn't the dumb money there's going to be
[37:24] dumb retail but don't fade ret retail in
[37:28] in Bitcoin because they are actually the
[37:29] people who've done the most work people
[37:32] in that shrimp cohort have done more
[37:34] study on bitcoin than Michael sailor has
[37:36] and that I think is a really really
[37:38] interesting and probably un
[37:40] underappreciated factor of Bitcoin is
[37:42] how successful the education machine has
[37:45] been and it's all open source right
[37:46] you've got a podcast I've got a newslet
[37:48] I've got a podcast people just make
[37:50] information free and this is what makes
[37:53] this asset so fascinating and like
[37:54] people are just intellectually
[37:56] stimulated by it and it's it's it's
[37:57] truly it's tremendous so there's no like
[37:59] specific number that you're like okay
[38:01] like 0.1 Bitcoin or something like that
[38:03] uh there's there's no no I realiz it
[38:05] didn't even answer your question at all
[38:06] no I've never actually run the
[38:07] statistics I mean in order to do that I
[38:09] mean you could do it but um the you
[38:11] would require I mean what I don't do is
[38:13] like get right in and pull out every
[38:15] utxo and it's just big data type stuff I
[38:18] don't get involved in that because it
[38:19] would be an interesting stat but there's
[38:21] so much noise in it too it's like is
[38:23] that an exchange wallet is it not it
[38:25] it's just a very very complex task and
[38:27] um yeah I guess the the question is does
[38:29] it does it give us a great deal of
[38:31] information I'm not sure yes that's
[38:33] that's true yeah it's it's it's I mean I
[38:36] think there's a psychology thing going
[38:38] on like if if people want to buy if if
[38:41] Bitcoin is the future and people want to
[38:43] now buying Bitcoin they they might maybe
[38:46] thinking like oh like I want to have at
[38:48] least so many Bitcoin that I'm
[38:50] considered rich in when Bitcoin is
[38:52] successful in 50 years like there's
[38:54] something along those lines and I also
[38:56] noticed like because I had some some
[38:58] videos with the title like oh get to
[39:00] blah blah blah Bitcoin and those are
[39:02] doing amazingly good I was I was to be
[39:05] all coiners exactly a whole coiners or
[39:08] like just like they want like x amount
[39:10] of Bitcoin okay that's where I should
[39:12] shoot for like that theology like of
[39:14] holding and getting to a Target um so
[39:17] and just on a on a very interesting kind
[39:18] of psychological element there have you
[39:20] heard of these guys who do this utxo I
[39:22] think it's called utxo dolive basically
[39:25] what they've done is they've recognized
[39:26] that psychology
[39:28] human beings love to send $100 $200
[39:31] $1,000 like exact round numbers of
[39:33] Bitcoin so you can actually see if you
[39:36] plot on any particular day you can see
[39:38] these clusters of like everyone spent
[39:41] this much Bitcoin everyone spent this
[39:43] much Bitcoin and it usually aligns with
[39:45] 100 a th000 10,000 you can see these
[39:48] like gradations so from that you can
[39:50] actually back calculate the Bitcoin
[39:53] price so you can use the utxo set I
[39:56] think they're within like Plus minus 2
[39:58] to 5% they can actually extract the
[40:01] Bitcoin price from just the utxos purely
[40:04] by the way that people spend their money
[40:06] which is a fascinating Insight but like
[40:08] you know it's it's we're creatures that
[40:10] love to follow these patterns that's an
[40:13] amazing inside what so like the because
[40:16] people are like sending yeah it's true
[40:18] like I also send usually the same amount
[40:20] actually uh there it's it's it's also
[40:24] why it's hard to estimate your original
[40:25] question of like how much Bitcoin do
[40:27] people have
[40:27] because you may have you may have 10
[40:29] Bitcoin but what do I see as a as a utxo
[40:33] analyst I see months and months and
[40:35] months of 0.1s it could belong to anyone
[40:38] I don't know who owns those things right
[40:39] so it's that like those utxos until you
[40:42] spend them all in one transaction or you
[40:44] do something that really proves they're
[40:46] all you and even then imagine how many
[40:48] people you got to track to work that out
[40:50] you see all the dcas but you don't see
[40:53] the total amount that individual holds
[40:55] so that's kind of a cool element to it
[40:57] too
[40:58] yeah that's also interesting and also um
[41:00] I think the the differentiation between
[41:03] retail versus institutional money is
[41:06] also interesting because Michael saor
[41:08] himself let's say he has like I don't
[41:10] know 15 or 20,000 Bitcoin something
[41:12] along those lines I don't remember the
[41:14] exact number the micro Strat has 210,000
[41:16] I think he's got over 1% so he's got
[41:18] over 210,000 now yeah 210,000 with micro
[41:22] strategy but him personally has like 10
[41:24] or
[41:25] 20,000 I think he he said in one
[41:28] interview that he has like 17,000 and
[41:31] that he has substantially more than that
[41:32] like more than that now but something
[41:34] like that and the difference that I
[41:36] wanted to make is like uh you want to
[41:39] count Michael sailor with his 17,000
[41:42] into retail kind of even though it's
[41:44] like of the retail that it gets but
[41:47] Micro strategy you don't want to get
[41:49] into retail so like this differentiation
[41:51] is probably also really really hard to
[41:53] to make on chain to to find out like who
[41:55] who's the the rich bitcoiners and I
[41:58] don't want to have uh like micro
[42:00] strategy in there and other big
[42:02] companies in there especially now where
[42:05] it gets more and more popular for
[42:06] companies to buy Bitcoin and put it on
[42:08] the balance sheet because of that it's
[42:10] companies have more purchasing power
[42:12] than a single person exactly and what I
[42:14] would say is just for your listeners um
[42:16] you will you will see on Twitter and all
[42:18] these social programs lots and lots of
[42:20] people love to talk about Wales so my
[42:24] advice after spending a lot of time with
[42:25] this data there is almost zero Edge and
[42:29] Alpha in studying Wales almost none it's
[42:32] all every single time you see someone be
[42:34] like oh it's Mr 100 it's not it's an
[42:36] exchange so for every Oh Mr whale is
[42:39] buying it's actually people depositing
[42:41] people selling it's not people buying so
[42:43] your your interpretation is exactly
[42:46] wrong and a lot of people then defend
[42:48] that and say but oh but who's the client
[42:50] it goes doesn't matter the fact that you
[42:51] don't know what this wallet actually is
[42:54] means that you can't make any
[42:56] interpretation on it cu you could be
[42:57] perfectly backwards so strangely enough
[43:01] whale data is very memeable lots of
[43:03] people like it it's complete dog
[43:06] there's no value in it whatsoever on the
[43:08] other side of the equation all the macro
[43:10] stuff right long-term holder Supply
[43:13] short-term Supply mvrv huge amounts of
[43:16] alpha no one cares about it so you know
[43:19] in terms of like trying to make the most
[43:21] out of your time go to where no one else
[43:23] is
[43:24] studying how do you see social media and
[43:27] uh news articles and and all the the
[43:30] sometimes like this Panic or this this
[43:32] formal in social media Rising
[43:34] influencing the onchain data there's
[43:37] probably like some that I'm remember
[43:40] it's like this fear and Creed index that
[43:42] I always see on Twitter how do you see
[43:44] social media influencing actually
[43:45] onchain data so one of my favorite lines
[43:48] is I love watching the narratives on
[43:50] Twitter not happening in onchain data
[43:52] because it is so obvious you will see it
[43:55] all the time and this is why I try to
[43:56] like get Subs prepared for you mentioned
[43:59] predictions before um one of my other
[44:01] lines is that I don't predict but I try
[44:03] to prepare so I don't know what the
[44:04] future hold it could be anything what I
[44:06] want to do is have people who are my
[44:08] followers prepared for what could happen
[44:11] so we don't know the future but if if we
[44:15] were to trade down to 47,000 there's a
[44:17] key onchain price Model down there it's
[44:20] going to be scary as hell the narratives
[44:22] on Twitter are going to be it's over and
[44:24] the Bears will be out in force if we do
[44:26] get into the 40,000
[44:27] you can imagine it right people be
[44:29] terrified check on chain subscribers
[44:31] will know that that is probably that is
[44:34] probably where the Bulls are going to
[44:35] mount their biggest defense now will
[44:36] they win I don't know maybe but I can
[44:39] expect they're going to put up a hell of
[44:41] a fight and will I be there in the
[44:42] trenches with them absolutely that's a
[44:44] level where I'm like I'm very
[44:45] comfortable to buy Bitcoin here because
[44:47] even if it goes to 30k I'm quite happy
[44:50] buying at 47 right I was happy buying at
[44:52] 50 and 53 these are all prices that I
[44:54] think are very valuable so in that
[44:56] instance
[44:57] the narratives are almost always
[44:59] particular the extremes absolute noise
[45:03] so I think that the onchain data when
[45:05] you see the narratives on Twitter and
[45:07] then you go and look at soapa every man
[45:09] in his dog will be saying 100K and the
[45:12] onchain data will be saying long-term
[45:14] holders are selling like crazy so maybe
[45:17] 100K but probably not just yet and this
[45:19] is like I use it to just ground myself
[45:21] and remove all that noise from Twitter
[45:24] um more often than not the noise you get
[45:25] on Twitter is noise it's not signal so
[45:28] interesting in that debate a lot of
[45:30] people uh get it sometimes in the
[45:32] comment like oh like uh bitcoin price is
[45:34] anyways controlled by the the Wales and
[45:36] the Wales are trying to manipulate the
[45:38] markets it's it's I think it's
[45:41] ridiculous uh but is there any onchain
[45:44] data is there anything to that argument
[45:47] um I have asked whenever I see that I
[45:50] get it often uh my question is based on
[45:52] what and I just wait until they give me
[45:55] some piece of evidence cuz I I would
[45:57] love to see it there is no question that
[46:00] in markets just generally there are big
[46:02] entities who have more purchasing power
[46:04] and more control in fact we actually
[46:07] should expect people to manipulate
[46:10] markets now what do I mean by that well
[46:12] let's say you're a big institution and
[46:13] you want to buy a billion dollars worth
[46:15] of
[46:16] bitcoin you need a billion dollars worth
[46:18] of people to be wrong and sell it to you
[46:21] so how do you do that I don't know maybe
[46:23] you start selling first to generate some
[46:26] fear right get all those people to sell
[46:28] a billion dollars worth of bitcoin to
[46:30] you so and this is not like this is not
[46:32] manipulation this is how markets work
[46:34] this is just the nature of them they're
[46:36] always like this so it's one of those
[46:38] things where a lot of people spend a lot
[46:40] of time complaining about manipulation
[46:43] without kind of just accepting that it's
[46:44] like what are you gonna do about it and
[46:46] it's it's always going to be this way
[46:48] it's never going to change some guy is
[46:50] gonna have more money than you he's
[46:52] going to want to achieve an outcome and
[46:54] this is why like getting chopped up in
[46:56] the all time noise is where so many
[46:58] people go wrong they they zoom in on the
[47:00] 1 hour chart and they panic and they're
[47:02] like holy it's all falling apart
[47:04] and then I zoom out and I look at the
[47:05] monthly chart I'm like it looks like a
[47:06] bull flag guys I don't know about you
[47:08] like it looks really really healthy um
[47:10] these big dogs work on the monthly and
[47:12] the weekly time frames I don't care
[47:14] about the hourly they may go down to the
[47:16] hourly to do some hand-to-hand combat
[47:17] and like take people's money but at the
[47:19] end of the day they care about the big
[47:21] Trend and people so often I know it's a
[47:24] cliche but these guys actually do zoom
[47:26] out they don't zoom in they only look at
[47:28] the big picture Trend and then they get
[47:30] their their analyst to go and sort
[47:31] things out in the smaller time frame so
[47:33] you know um whale manipulation it's
[47:36] always there what are you going to do
[47:37] about it people complain they do a lot
[47:39] more complaining than actually
[47:40] delivering any kind of evidence to be
[47:42] like here it is here's the the
[47:44] footprints and the Fingerprints of it
[47:45] going on yeah it's also the the thing
[47:48] why I think it's ridiculous because
[47:49] manipulating means buying and selling
[47:51] and buying sing the free
[47:53] market exactly that's exactly right and
[47:57] it's so interesting for I kind of have
[47:59] that feeling when they write in the
[48:01] comments and I feel like they they think
[48:03] there's like a secret telegram group
[48:05] where all the whales are coming together
[48:06] and like hey today we are selling and
[48:08] let's push the market down so we can buy
[48:09] tomorrow like like I don't know if this
[48:12] exists but I'm fairly certain that it
[48:14] probably
[48:15] doesn't so I would say there are those
[48:18] telegram groups but the I guess the
[48:20] question is for for the reply guys in
[48:22] the audience who who you know think that
[48:24] there's manipulation do you think
[48:26] there's manipulation because you bought
[48:28] and then the price went down or like if
[48:32] you just buy when so and MVR via low
[48:35] there will be less manipulation is
[48:37] probably the way I would frame it
[48:38] because your buyers will all be better
[48:40] and then you won't worry about the
[48:41] manipulation because your buying when
[48:43] the whales have manipulated the price
[48:45] down just buy then right just change
[48:47] your system that's a that's a that's a
[48:48] great way to think about it um to the to
[48:51] the point do you think the the
[48:53] volatility of of Bitcoin is a is a good
[48:55] thing absolutely so if you look at the
[48:59] volatility chart for like realized
[49:01] volatility it goes up in a bull so it
[49:05] goes down in a bear so whenever people
[49:07] like Bitcoin is too volatile it's like
[49:08] that's great I love it because when
[49:10] bitcoin's volatile means it's going up
[49:12] um it trades a lot more like a commodity
[49:15] um this is commodity like Behavior
[49:16] volatility goes up in a bull um in in
[49:19] stocks it's the opposite equities tend
[49:20] to have lower volatility like this slow
[49:22] manipulated talking about manipulated
[49:24] look at the stock markets like a
[49:25] straight line that just goes up that's
[49:27] manipulated guys that's ridiculous
[49:29] because the world around us look around
[49:31] there's nothing low volatility about it
[49:33] it's crazy so this like straight line up
[49:36] that's the so um the volatility
[49:38] of Bitcoin is scary for people however
[49:41] it's it's the asset and I think Michael
[49:43] saor does do a good job of talking about
[49:45] this it's like at the end of the day you
[49:46] do not go from zero to Global Reserve
[49:49] asset without a bit of volatility you
[49:51] need volatility for the most part it is
[49:54] to the upside so you know it's all about
[49:57] tradeoffs and you know for some people
[49:59] volatility can't deal with it but you
[50:00] know you've probably been around this
[50:01] Market long enough you get used to it
[50:03] and uh I think long term I I look at my
[50:07] own self right I've seen my net worth
[50:08] drop by 75 80% multiple times there
[50:12] ain't nothing like that to harden you up
[50:15] imagine when all these people end up who
[50:16] whove like weathered some of this
[50:18] and they've gone into decision- making
[50:20] or politics or company CEOs or whatever
[50:23] they're going to be able to make really
[50:25] hard decisions because they've been
[50:26] through some really hard stuff and I
[50:28] think that that's actually it's it's
[50:30] massively underappreciated I find when
[50:31] people like oh I don't want it to go
[50:33] down 20% I'm like then don't invest
[50:35] because like what are you what are you
[50:36] here for you going to get your 5%
[50:38] returns and have nothing at the end
[50:40] anyway you have to accept that risk is a
[50:43] part of it a lot of people also equate
[50:45] volatility to risk but like if it's
[50:48] volatile to the upside that's great and
[50:51] even when you look at it from the
[50:52] volatility standpoint sharp ratio
[50:55] saltino ratio however you want to
[50:56] measure it
[50:57] you are more than compensated for the
[51:00] returns so even though it goes down it
[51:02] goes up so much more and it not only
[51:05] does it go up so much more it blows
[51:07] every other asset in the world out of
[51:08] the park multiple times year after year
[51:11] after year so it's kind of like an
[51:13] undeniable fact and when you see people
[51:15] who particularly tradire guys like oh
[51:16] it's too
[51:17] volatile um I think it was um was halfer
[51:20] from from Swan he did this great
[51:22] exercise he could not convince his Trad
[51:25] mate to buy Bitcoin they was working
[51:26] investment firm and he made Bitcoin like
[51:29] a like a hedge fund tear sheet just like
[51:31] you know hedge fund X and he showed
[51:33] their return profile and their Shar
[51:34] oration he gave it to the same guy and
[51:36] goes mate what do you think about this
[51:37] guy's returns and he goes oh man we have
[51:40] to invest in this it's like it's Bitcoin
[51:42] dude like it's it's not a hedge fund
[51:44] it's just Bitcoin because like if you
[51:46] just take away the rapper it it makes a
[51:49] whole lot of
[51:50] sense that's that's an amazing Insight
[51:53] um there's also that there's this
[51:55] narrative around Bitcoin being an
[51:57] inflation hatch and and being a hedge
[51:59] against the basement and I think a lot
[52:01] of outside people from that that they
[52:04] are not in Bitcoin the trade fire guys
[52:07] they think of like oh Bitcoin is that or
[52:09] wants to be that um and then they see
[52:11] the volatility and then they're like oh
[52:13] like inflation went up this month 10%
[52:16] but Bitcoin went down 5% like oh
[52:19] obviously it's not an inflation look at
[52:20] the latest hourly candle and make a
[52:23] holistic assessment of the whole asset
[52:25] yeah and that's that's so funny for me
[52:27] because like yeah yeah like it it's a
[52:29] growing asset like it it gets like H
[52:31] it's not on this final Edge like it
[52:34] Bitcoin is still in an adopting curve
[52:36] and I think that's like what what people
[52:39] think of like but is there do you see
[52:42] that um as the main uh narrative around
[52:45] Bitcoin for being an inflation and
[52:47] debasement hge or what's your like why
[52:51] why Bitcoin like what's the the main
[52:52] story or narrative for you yep no I
[52:56] think I think primarily Bitcoin is the
[52:58] store of value Asset I think that's its
[53:00] primary narrative and and role and the
[53:03] story that I'll kind of give here to
[53:05] illustrate it inflation is a relative
[53:08] thing so there's obviously the
[53:09] debasement which is that we our fa
[53:11] currency losers purchasing power now I
[53:14] don't particularly worry about the price
[53:15] of bread in Bitcoin because I use my
[53:18] fair currency for that yeah it's painful
[53:19] that it's going up but how do I solve
[53:21] that problem you just going to have to
[53:22] go and earn more money that's that's
[53:24] just the nature of the Beast so in terms
[53:25] of my living expenses my medium exchange
[53:28] life that's an Australian dollar problem
[53:30] and that's that's its own basket when we
[53:33] move to okay I don't particularly care
[53:35] about the next month two months three
[53:36] months five months what is my inflation
[53:39] rate right my inflation rate is houses
[53:43] because I don't own a home and at some
[53:44] point I'd like to buy one so for me here
[53:47] in Australia my inflation rate is
[53:49] something in the order between 12 and
[53:51] 20% a year pretty hefty right our
[53:54] property Market's gone through the roof
[53:55] whether it can keep doing that who knows
[53:57] but my inflation raised 20% a year so
[54:00] let's look at how is my Bitcoin my
[54:03] savings how is my savings doing at
[54:06] storing value to buy the thing that I
[54:09] want which is the house since 2020 first
[54:12] of January Australian house prices and
[54:14] this actually is dated only up to March
[54:17] um this year because it's
[54:19] quarterly the Australian house price is
[54:22] up uh 45% versus the Australian dollar
[54:25] so over the course of that 4 years it's
[54:27] up 45% I think it's down
[54:31] 75% in BTC terms so what does that mean
[54:34] even though the Australian dollar has
[54:36] lost 40 45% purchasing power versus The
[54:38] Thing I want to buy my savings can buy
[54:42] me four times more house that is a store
[54:45] of value over that meaningful time frame
[54:47] over the thing that I want to buy over
[54:49] my inflation time frame which is a
[54:52] couple of years in order to save for a
[54:53] deposit for a house Bitcoin has done
[54:55] exactly what it needed to do and it's
[54:57] not only storing my value right gold is
[54:59] done about the same as housing it gold
[55:02] stored my value Bitcoin grew my value
[55:05] it's actually better than a store of
[55:07] value because it's kicking ass it's four
[55:09] times better than the next best thing so
[55:11] at the end of the day it's doing exactly
[55:13] what it needs to do as a store of value
[55:15] and people who don't agree either bought
[55:17] too high right they continue to buy too
[55:20] high CU not using so and mvrv or they
[55:23] have this bias they just hate Bitcoin
[55:24] it's not because you think it's not a
[55:25] story of value because you're you're
[55:27] ignorant you just don't like the asset
[55:28] it's okay some people don't like the
[55:30] asset but like you know you got to be
[55:32] intellectually honest about these
[55:33] arguments and these tradire guys they
[55:34] just
[55:35] not I think it uh like that that's
[55:38] always my way to think of like you have
[55:40] Bitcoin as a store of value uh Bitcoin
[55:42] has like an inflation hch but on top of
[55:45] that you have adoption and that's the
[55:48] volatile part because like people coming
[55:50] in it's like a lot of uh formo a lot of
[55:53] hectic a lot of fear and DBS that coming
[55:56] into the market with a news cycle and
[55:58] social media and everything going on in
[56:00] the world uh but I think like the store
[56:02] of value part is all already quite um um
[56:06] stable and the the volatility just comes
[56:09] from like oh we we a tiny asset still
[56:12] and we are becoming like a really big
[56:14] asset and the and the vision is really
[56:16] big and there are those people that have
[56:18] like 1% of their net worth in in Bitcoin
[56:21] then there are those those crazy people
[56:22] like me that have 100% in the the net
[56:24] worth and like there's a lot of
[56:26] interesting things going on and so that
[56:28] that's always like how I try to explain
[56:30] it to people completely outside of
[56:32] Bitcoin that you have like those two
[56:33] sets and in in one price and if you only
[56:37] look at the store value side of course
[56:39] you cannot factor out volatility uh but
[56:42] yeah it's like I that's why I also like
[56:44] Michel saor talking about volatility I
[56:46] think he said that so great in in in the
[56:48] beginning of the days when when he went
[56:50] on the podcast he said like volatility
[56:52] is the price you pay for that massive
[56:54] uptick that you get in purchasing power
[56:57] if if your volatility is 5% you're not
[56:59] going to make 30% a year which means
[57:01] you're not going to beat the inflation
[57:02] rate no matter what you do sure there
[57:05] are going to be assets out there which
[57:07] are 30% to the downside every year
[57:09] that's bad volatility but you're not
[57:12] going to beat inflation at 25% or 20%
[57:15] whatever it is with a 5% Vol asset it's
[57:18] just not going to happen you need the
[57:20] volatility to beat it so in in many ways
[57:22] if we expect inflation is going to be a
[57:24] feature of our life moving M forward
[57:26] into basement which I do it's one of the
[57:28] best assets in the world because it's
[57:29] going to it's one of the few things
[57:30] that's going to be able to outpace that
[57:32] so here's an interesting thing I wrote a
[57:33] report on Monday or Tuesday um which
[57:38] even I learned something like I always
[57:39] learned a little bit but this was a
[57:40] great I really enjoyed this piece um I
[57:43] basically looked at they've got the US
[57:44] CPI number which we all know as
[57:46] so I just tested what is the Bitcoin
[57:49] price there's two things is what do we
[57:50] see we see $58,000 Bitcoin what do we
[57:54] feel what do we feel and that's our
[57:56] purchasing power if we look at CPI we're
[58:00] actually at 45k if we look at CPI * 3
[58:03] we're down at 35k so and that's in $220
[58:06] so in terms of our 2020 purchasing power
[58:09] how we feel we never said a new alltime
[58:12] high right we at the 2021 the first Peak
[58:15] by the way which I've been an advocate
[58:16] for that first peak in April that was
[58:18] the real all-time high the November one
[58:20] was um so much there's an
[58:23] infinite amount of metrics that that
[58:24] tell you that that second High wasn't
[58:26] real when you inflation adjust it that
[58:29] first high in April that is the all-time
[58:32] high and strangely enough if you price
[58:35] that all-time high in today's dollars in
[58:37] 2024 it's 100,000 so if you look at this
[58:41] thing we are 40% below that 2021 alltime
[58:45] high on an inflation adjusted basis and
[58:47] that assumes that CPI is three times
[58:49] under reported which is probably on the
[58:51] low side could be more than that but the
[58:53] real takeaway here inflation is a really
[58:56] Insidious tax we may be down 25 from the
[59:00] March alltime high but we're actually
[59:02] missing an additional
[59:04] 145% that we've lost in purchasing power
[59:07] over the last four years right that's
[59:09] how much that draw down is actually way
[59:11] worse so that's why a lot of people feel
[59:14] like this Market is different um we are
[59:17] simultaneously very small right 1.2
[59:20] trillion is a very small asset in the
[59:22] grand scheme of things but we're also
[59:24] very big because 1 2 trillion is not
[59:26] small it's the 10th biggest asset in the
[59:28] world so bitcoin's in this really
[59:30] interesting world where it's both small
[59:33] and large it's like a a small fish
[59:35] that's just been put into a bigger pond
[59:37] that's really where Bitcoin is in its
[59:39] life right now so that volatility it's
[59:40] going to be a part of this thing the the
[59:43] inflation side of the story The
[59:44] debasement all of these things this is
[59:46] what Bitcoin is wrapped around this is
[59:49] what it does it is there to help people
[59:51] survive all of these things and the
[59:53] volatility is a tool to help it do that
[59:56] on that note uh how by the way really
[59:59] really create that Insight but how does
[60:01] uh ETFs and institutional money that
[60:03] came into like the the last four years
[60:05] basically with I think 2020 with micr
[60:08] strategy that kind of was like the
[60:10] starting point for for institutional
[60:12] publicly traded companies coming into
[60:14] the SC now the ETF also with
[60:16] 2024 had that any influence on onchain
[60:20] data that's a great question and I get
[60:23] this one quite a lot actually um the
[60:25] short answer is no surprisingly and I
[60:27] literally wake up every single day and
[60:29] I'm like the first thing I'm like all
[60:30] right which metric's broken something's
[60:31] got to break here it's all going to die
[60:33] and finish and um a lot of people like
[60:35] oh the TR so here's an example we have
[60:39] gone through these ETFs and I've had the
[60:41] same arguments I think about four times
[60:44] now what is an ETF an ETF is a offchain
[60:48] basket of pool of coins where coins go
[60:50] in and then they do something on the
[60:51] inside trade around whatever else when
[60:54] have we seen this happen
[60:56] 2017 Finance all these centralized
[60:59] exchanges coins go in they trade
[61:00] shitcoins on the inside but there's a
[61:02] big sink of coins that go in we saw it
[61:05] in 2019 there was the plus token Ponzi
[61:07] coins went in there was like a 2% spot
[61:10] bid absorbed 2% of all the coins they
[61:12] all went in and then they eventually got
[61:13] Market sold by the uh by the Chinese
[61:15] government we saw it with gbtc
[61:18] 665,000 Bitcoin in four months
[61:22] extraordinary amounts of volumes going
[61:24] all the way into this and then the
[61:26] Arbitrage stopped in February 2021 a lot
[61:28] of people like oh we should have gone to
[61:30] 100,000 or oh we was you know a cut
[61:32] short cycle no we had
[61:35] 665,000 Bitcoin of demand in four months
[61:39] from December through to April and then
[61:42] it stopped almost in the blink of an eye
[61:45] that's what killed the bull market so
[61:47] that is another one coins go in trade
[61:50] around the inside and here we are with
[61:51] the ETFs and I've been looking for so
[61:54] long waiting for my metrics to to break
[61:57] but what's really interesting about it
[61:59] and Jim biano has been banging on about
[62:01] why these ETFs are you know they just an
[62:03] orange poker chip and all that stuff the
[62:05] ETFs are between 10 and 20% of the total
[62:08] Market there's been this like weird
[62:10] assumption that now that the Bitcoin
[62:12] ETFs are here the entire Market
[62:15] infrastructure that's been around for 15
[62:17] years just gone disappeared no it's
[62:21] still the 90% of the market right the
[62:23] ETFs are big but they're not dominant
[62:26] so we are not at the phase where the
[62:28] ETFs are driving things they may get
[62:30] there they'll get they'll grow in size
[62:33] they are simultaneously like Bitcoin
[62:35] simultaneously the most successful ETFs
[62:38] that have ever launched and less than
[62:41] 10% of the market so they're both big
[62:43] and small at the same time so you know
[62:45] it's just one of those classic
[62:46] narratives where we wait for these
[62:48] metrics to break but it's all those
[62:50] coins you and I transacting coins in and
[62:53] out every day billions of dollars goes
[62:55] in and billions of dollars comes out of
[62:57] exchanges every single one of those
[62:58] coins has a signature of who bought it
[63:01] at what price and what's their profit
[63:02] and loss every single one is that also
[63:05] why this fouryear cycle doesn't break
[63:09] that's a good question actually um I'm
[63:11] I'm undecided on what happens with the
[63:12] four-year cycle I am going into this
[63:15] cycle assuming that it won't break
[63:16] because so far it hasn't and
[63:18] simultaneously assuming it's already
[63:19] broken because so I'm not anchoring to
[63:21] either direction because it really could
[63:24] be if there's one time where it's likely
[63:26] to be broken it's
[63:28] now a theory I've been playing around
[63:31] with which is not fully formed but this
[63:33] concept of like maybe people forget what
[63:35] the cycle looks like so for example this
[63:37] this last like six months is just
[63:39] sideways boring choppy price action and
[63:41] I actually did an exercise today where I
[63:43] took the whole trading view price chart
[63:45] and I took one year and I literally just
[63:47] scrolled slowly from left to right since
[63:50] the beginning of the price all the way
[63:51] through and I was looking for anything
[63:53] that looks like our current price
[63:55] structure there's nothing the only close
[63:58] equivalent is 2019 that's by far the
[64:00] closest and I've had this like weird
[64:02] idea again it's just an idea there's no
[64:03] real basis to it aside from gutfield
[64:05] what if people lose track of where we
[64:08] are in the cycle we have this like rally
[64:10] and then like just
[64:12] sideways do we just have a bear do we
[64:14] have a bull are we still in like the
[64:16] bull like where where the hell are we
[64:17] and people just like lose track of but
[64:20] hang on a second it's December shouldn't
[64:21] we be at the top and it's down like just
[64:24] just things that just grow people off
[64:26] and everyone's going to go looking for
[64:28] here's the parabola oh no here's the
[64:30] bear and it's just not going to look the
[64:32] same that's an instinct that I have that
[64:34] we just kind of lose track of things
[64:35] because everyone's looking for the
[64:37] obvious answer and I think there's
[64:39] enough people looking for that obvious
[64:41] answer and my experience markets tend to
[64:43] do something else when everyone's
[64:44] looking for the obvious answer it tends
[64:46] to go somewhere else that that's
[64:49] interesting do you also see how many
[64:51] people hold their Bitcoin on exchangers
[64:54] like in self custody like a metrix like
[64:57] that because I feel like most bitcoiners
[64:59] hold in an exchange but most Bitcoin are
[65:00] hold in self custody yes yeah um so I
[65:04] haven't checked the numbers in a little
[65:05] while because I don't spend too much
[65:06] time looking at exchange balances last I
[65:08] checked it was something like 2 and a
[65:10] half million um Bitcoin and exchanges
[65:12] and honestly that's been pretty flat for
[65:14] years right so here's another Pro tip
[65:18] everyone loves to share exchange
[65:20] balances mute complete noise there's no
[65:24] Alpha in it whatsoever when you see oh
[65:26]  exchange balances are almost
[65:27] completely drained mute that person
[65:29] because they have no idea what they're
[65:30] talking about exchange balances are
[65:32] never completely drain someone will
[65:34] always deposit them and it's more likely
[65:36] you're looking at a data error so
[65:39] exchange balances are just not useful
[65:41] information what a lot of people Miss is
[65:43] that those coins go in and out of
[65:45] coinbase and coinbase custody and they
[65:47] they're moving around between all these
[65:49] big institutions notc desks it is not
[65:52] worth worrying about unless you're a
[65:53] fully equipped and qualified data
[65:56] scientist don't worry about exchange
[65:57] balances um that said in terms of like
[66:00] their General size there's something in
[66:02] the order like two and a half million
[66:03] coinbase custody's got like another
[66:05] million coins but that's got ETFs and
[66:07] micro strategy and all that kind gbtc so
[66:10] there's a whole lot of Dynamics there
[66:11] but um yeah a lot of people love
[66:13] exchange balance metrics because they
[66:14] like think that it's like oh look Supply
[66:16] squeeze no there won't be a supply
[66:18] squeeze because people continue to sell
[66:20] and this is the great irony was like you
[66:22] know everyone's like oh no the price is
[66:24] you know it's going to squeeze at any
[66:25] it's like no it's not because guys are
[66:27] still selling when that stops maybe but
[66:30] until that point no yeah that's I mean
[66:32] uh
[66:32] if if people have that argument that
[66:35] exchanges will run out of uh out of
[66:37] Bitcoin it's like no it it will not
[66:40] because even if the price runs high at
[66:43] some point someone is selling and the
[66:45] price might run up really heavily
[66:47] depends on what happens maybe have H
[66:49] inflation whatever uh but at some point
[66:52] there is like a stop to it uh and I
[66:55] don't know maybe we come to the point of
[66:57] like people don't want to trade Bitcoin
[67:00] for any feed currency but that's like
[67:03] hyperbitcoinization but even then we
[67:05] have a Bitcoin market so um that's thing
[67:09] if I wake up one day and there's a tweet
[67:11] that's believable it's like there's only
[67:12] one Bitcoin left the price will be like
[67:14] a billion dollars and I will sell one
[67:17] Bitcoin to just add to that it's just
[67:20] you know like if you wake up tomorrow
[67:21] and the price is a million dollars every
[67:23] single person sitting listening to this
[67:25] will probably
[67:26] you may not actually sell but you better
[67:28] believe that your brain's going to be
[67:29] like maybe that's for sure that's for
[67:32] sure um do you think that fiat currency
[67:34] will will always be around I do actually
[67:37] yeah I'm I'm I'm in the camp where as
[67:39] much as Fiat is a blight on society
[67:41] governments will never give up the
[67:43] control and in many ways as a bitcoiner
[67:47] I would much rather have an asset that I
[67:49] can use to transact in my economy that I
[67:52] can borrow and not be even remotely
[67:55] concerned that it's going to blow me up
[67:57] if I borrow
[67:58] Bitcoin that's hard because if I you
[68:01] know I'm now short Bitcoin if I sell it
[68:03] to buy anything I'm now short Bitcoin
[68:04] that's that's a tough sell if I borrow
[68:07] Australian dollars it's going to be
[68:09] toilet paper the longer I hold it so
[68:11] essentially I can you know go and use
[68:12] spend that into the economy I can borrow
[68:14] against my hard scarce Bitcoin and use
[68:17] that in the economy and honestly I think
[68:19] this is a this is the third in the whole
[68:22] world of crypto I believe there are
[68:25] three primary product Market fits there
[68:29] is stable coins which undeniably are a
[68:31] product Market fit there's Bitcoin as
[68:33] the ultimate store of value Asset and
[68:35] there's the ability to borrow against my
[68:37] my Bitcoin those are the three killer
[68:39] apps I don't think there are any other
[68:40] killer apps in in the crypto world and
[68:43] you know the I think Fair currency will
[68:45] always be around I think the US dollar
[68:46] will be the reserve currency for as long
[68:48] as I'm alive I just don't see these
[68:51] power balances changing there there
[68:52] there's no other real alternative the
[68:54] world's not ready to to go to a Bitcoin
[68:56] standard it's probably not even ready to
[68:57] go to a gold standard what it is
[68:59] prepared for is for the people who
[69:02] understand those two assets Bitcoin and
[69:03] gold to probably do pretty well over the
[69:06] next decade and a half because they
[69:08] understand the problem that we're facing
[69:10] Fair currency will get to based but as
[69:12] you would no doubt know and pretty much
[69:14] everyone listening to this would know
[69:15] you got a lot of friends out there that
[69:17] you still can't convince no matter all
[69:19] this inflation all this you still can't
[69:22] convince them to get Bitcoin so we are
[69:25] so far away from people losing faith and
[69:27] if if you can't convince 100% of your
[69:29] friends that they should buy a little
[69:31] bit of Bitcoin there ain't no chance Fe
[69:34] currencies going anywhere until you
[69:35] solve that
[69:36] problem this argument makes sense
[69:38] because like I I made I think a week ago
[69:41] or something like that podcast with
[69:42] Ariel agila from from Argentina I think
[69:46] he wrote Bitcoin prophecy or something
[69:48] like that the book it's called and we
[69:50] basically went through Argentina's
[69:53] history and there were like a lot of
[69:54] points where like they created a new
[69:57] local currency of of Argentina however
[70:00] it was called it lasted two years then
[70:02] they made a new one it lasted four years
[70:05] and they still keep going like the
[70:07] inflation is massive when you look at
[70:09] Argentina they they
[70:11] earned, five years ago now they're
[70:13] earning $300 like that that that's
[70:16] massive but they still are not on a har
[70:18] bit condensation the same with turkey so
[70:21] I'm really positive and really
[70:22] optimistic on bitcoin maybe being one
[70:24] day the only currency and asset that we
[70:26] have but then I also look at reality on
[70:28] Argentina and turkey and all those
[70:30] places and I'm like they don't get
[70:32] Bitcoin like I get why someone uh with a
[70:36] 10 20 30% inflation rate doesn't get
[70:38] Bitcoin when but when it gets to the
[70:40] hundreds and even thousands and
[70:42] hyperinflation where we like just
[70:44] completely debish a fe currency and make
[70:47] a new one up then the next day
[70:50] like we need like people not waking up
[70:53] to that like I I'm
[70:56] the thing I find quite interesting about
[70:58] those scenarios is they're adopting
[70:59] tether and if you think about the scale
[71:02] between the Euro and Bitcoin the
[71:05] Australian dollar and Bitcoin that
[71:07] magnitude of scarcity Delta is probably
[71:10] about the same as the Argentine peso to
[71:13] the US dollar it's about the same
[71:14] magnitude right in log scale that's a
[71:17] one to a 10 and then 10 to 100 so in a
[71:20] way when we see this dollarization
[71:22] they're not ready for the full Quantum
[71:24] Leap from one to 100 but they are ready
[71:26] for the 1 to 10 and in the Western World
[71:30] you know the 1 to 10 is probably the
[71:31] gold and Bitcoin that's the next kind of
[71:33] step for them so we're going to see
[71:35] these little microcosms of what happens
[71:37] when you go from an unsound money to a
[71:39] Sounder money the US dollar may not be
[71:42] sound but it's sure as hell sound versus
[71:43] the Turkish l so we're going to see
[71:45] these like adoption curves of what
[71:47] happens to a society when you start to
[71:49] improve by a naturally market-based
[71:52] alternative which is the US dollar so I
[71:54] think it's a really interesting and
[71:56] underappreciated microcosm of what
[71:58] hyperbitcoinization could look like if
[72:00] it happened in the western world really
[72:02] really cool thank you so much um we're
[72:04] already in the the end routine of our
[72:07] podcast where we ask the same question
[72:09] to every guest and then uh another
[72:11] question the first question that every
[72:13] guest gets what can we learn from you
[72:15] besides all the things that we already
[72:17] talked about oh interesting um I think
[72:20] always like you have to invest in
[72:22] yourself right I mean for me my my like
[72:25] main hobby my addiction is kite surfing
[72:27] and there's something about being like
[72:29] half like 75% in control and 25% just
[72:32] let nature take the wheel for me that
[72:35] like that risk component actually
[72:37] relaxes my mind um another saying is
[72:40] that when I I was living in London and
[72:42] my friend came to live with us for a bit
[72:44] and um he'd been living I think he was
[72:46] in Poland and Netherlands so he was like
[72:48] really like just out living by himself
[72:50] um and he said you have to find your
[72:52] yogurt and what did he mean by that he
[72:54] like every morning he just has his
[72:56] granola and his yogurt and that was the
[72:58] thing that like oriented him for the day
[73:00] so I I think like people find find your
[73:03] yogurt find the thing that like orients
[73:05] you and just like grounds you for the
[73:07] day find the thing that helps you
[73:09] de-stress and relax and like find
[73:12] yourself because at the end of the day
[73:14] whether you're an investor whatever
[73:16] you're doing the your biggest enemy in
[73:18] everything is always yourself you spend
[73:20] so much more time thinking through your
[73:22] own thoughts and going through your own
[73:24] you spend more time time with yourself
[73:25] than with anyone else in your life so
[73:27] learning to understand who you are and
[73:29] what drives you is really really
[73:31] powerful because it sets you up for
[73:32] everything else right and you can attack
[73:34] all these problems differently um go for
[73:36] a walk I find going for a walk is just
[73:38] tremendous like reset my brain um I also
[73:42] like for me I've realized that sometimes
[73:43] when I write an article the next day I
[73:46] actually need the whole day to just like
[73:47] allow my juices to recharge um so you
[73:50] know find your yogurt it's probably how
[73:52] I'd I'd answer that question are you
[73:54] walking with with uh music or podcast or
[73:57] like just like uh
[73:59] playing yeah no I'm I'm I I don't know
[74:02] how many hours of podcast I consume a
[74:03] week but it's a lot oh yeah it's it's
[74:06] it's great like podcasts like I'm always
[74:09] switching between podcast and music it's
[74:11] like kind of like switching around it's
[74:13] but it's really interesting when you
[74:15] walk with nothing like that that feels
[74:17] no it is weird that thing go deep as far
[74:21] as I'm aware your brain is much better
[74:23] at processing information when you're
[74:24] walking it like activates more parts of
[74:26] your brain so walking Einstein used to
[74:28] walk like 5 hours a day because it just
[74:30] like helped him digest information I
[74:32] think that's probably about right
[74:34] absolutely really cool perfect and our
[74:36] other Andro is where the previous guest
[74:38] is question is asking a question for the
[74:40] next guest without knowing who the next
[74:41] guest actually is um and the question is
[74:44] as soon Bitcoin becomes gold 2.0 what
[74:48] does that look like interesting so I
[74:50] think it's it's kind of a dynamic where
[74:51] Bitcoin is I mean the fact that we had
[74:55] two presidential candidates in the US
[74:58] even just it's not going to happen not
[75:01] anytime soon but talking about Bitcoin
[75:03] as a reserve asset that is very
[75:05] interesting you know like that that we
[75:07] are not talking there's no silver
[75:08] conferences doing this um another one
[75:12] there's the the in go we trust report
[75:14] which is like a fantastic macro research
[75:16] piece comes out once a year probably one
[75:18] of the most viewed macro articles in the
[75:21] in the
[75:22] industry they had a whole segment on go
[75:25] on bitcoin they had it at like 3%
[75:28] recommended portfolio allocation between
[75:30] 3 and 5 and it was in the pages before
[75:33] silver this is a gold report and they
[75:36] have Bitcoin before silver we're there
[75:39] guys we're like getting very very close
[75:41] to this point where it's on the same
[75:42] playing field now what does gold 2.0
[75:44] look like there's always the risk that
[75:47] like with gold you know in terms of that
[75:49] manipulation conversation we had before
[75:51] there's been claims about the gold
[75:52] market being manipulated forever and I I
[75:54] believe those actually
[75:55] and the reason why that happens is
[75:57] you've got 100 to one paper claims
[75:59] versus physical I don't know about you
[76:02] if you've ever gone to buy physical gold
[76:03] if you haven't it is a process it is not
[76:06] an easy thing most people do not want to
[76:09] have bars of expensive metal in their
[76:11] house so it's one of those things that
[76:14] the custody the custody is the reason
[76:16] that that happens with gold you cannot
[76:19] there is no company in the world who can
[76:22] reh hypothecate my Bitcoin because they
[76:24] don't have it I've got it it's not
[76:25] theirs so self- custody of Bitcoin is so
[76:29] critically important because it is the
[76:31] defense mechanism against gold 2.0 um I
[76:35] think that when you go through the
[76:37] process of looking at like silver coins
[76:39] they're heavy they're bulky they're big
[76:41] if they get scratched they lose value
[76:43] sometimes they just tarnish on their own
[76:45] like there's all sorts of problems there
[76:47] gold is exponentially smaller per unit
[76:50] of value one gold coin is 85 silver
[76:53] coins Bitcoin is no space at all
[76:57] exponentially better so it is or it's
[76:59] it's it's better than gold right so it's
[77:01] going to get there um I think gold will
[77:04] always be a an asset for the central
[77:06] banks and governments I think Bitcoin
[77:08] will be that same thing for the
[77:09] individual and maybe the corporation and
[77:12] that's great I think that is bitcoin's
[77:13] sole purpose is to help people like you
[77:15] and I avoid the whole inflation side of
[77:18] this
[77:19] equation perfect thank you so much uh
[77:22] James for being on uh Before I Let You
[77:24] Go where can people find you and and
