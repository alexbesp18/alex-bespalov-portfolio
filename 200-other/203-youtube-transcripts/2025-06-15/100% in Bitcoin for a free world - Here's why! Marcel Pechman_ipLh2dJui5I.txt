[00:00] if you believe in Bitcoin you don't buy
[00:01] 3% you buy 100% you get the max depth
[00:05] you can get in Via terms and you also
[00:07] use that proceeds to buy more Bitcoin I
[00:10] really love that you said that El
[00:12] Salvador is not bullish enough Bitcoin
[00:13] is always always going to be the money
[00:15] of the Free World of the people who opt
[00:18] out of that system so they're just going
[00:20] to change from government issue to
[00:22] corporate issue you're going to Amazon
[00:24] is going to buy a country and people who
[00:26] live on the Amazon country they only
[00:28] circulate with Amazon money apple is
[00:30] going to buy a country for themselves
[00:32] people who live there have their apple
[00:34] houses Apple watches Apple cars Apple
[00:37] everything I never heard that companies
[00:39] have much more strength to survive than
[00:42] countries especially when we move to a
[00:44] digital world we don't need to be so
[00:47] controlled by comp we can have our own
[00:49] schools our own health system we can
[00:51] have private roads and we can go from
[00:53] [Music]
[00:56] there hi Marcel how you doing everything
[00:58] fine on your end
[01:00] hi Robin uh everything good down here
[01:02] from Brazil uh I think there's a little
[01:05] bit disappointing news from Mexico I
[01:07] heard this morning but it's
[01:11] life what's the disappointing news from
[01:14] from Mexico there was
[01:17] uh a socialist president a woman that
[01:22] happened to be woman a socialist com
[01:24] president that happen to be elected
[01:26] today so when you think about Latin
[01:29] America these things don't happen by
[01:32] chance or by par Hazard it's like it's
[01:35] the whole block that is moving to the
[01:37] Socialist side so I'm kind of sound
[01:40] sadden by that not that I'm left Winger
[01:42] or right- Winger I I I don't care I'm
[01:45] libertarian I don't care for politics
[01:47] but it's sad to see when Latin America
[01:49] is heading that
[01:50] way I totally agree with with you and
[01:54] there's too much politic politics going
[01:56] on I feel like in in this year like
[01:58] American election European Union has the
[02:01] election Austria has European union and
[02:04] Austrian national election uh so it's
[02:08] like this year yes it's like three
[02:10] months uh difference it's we have next
[02:13] like we have next Sunday the election
[02:16] for the European Union and we have then
[02:19] three months later the Austrian national
[02:22] uh election uh so for me in my situation
[02:25] it's like just too much polit politics
[02:28] right now I I does the president have
[02:31] actual power like can he change things
[02:34] by himself or he needs approval from
[02:36] Congress and Senate and
[02:39] whatever work in Austria yeah yeah um
[02:43] it's not the presidential election uh in
[02:45] Austria it's the Congress I don't know
[02:49] how it's called actually in English but
[02:51] but it's the N National Parliament that
[02:54] is voted for and this is the one the
[02:57] this is the uh instant that actually has
[03:00] the power to vote for everything like
[03:02] whatever is coming into coming from the
[03:06] government as a suggestion the
[03:08] parliament has to vote for it uh so but
[03:11] the the president of Austria has little
[03:15] to no uh Power okay he he earns good
[03:19] money he's a representative figure in in
[03:22] Austria but when it comes to actual um
[03:25] Power it's not really uh important uh
[03:30] for for for the actual influence for the
[03:33] law it's more like uh when when there's
[03:36] a new government the president picks the
[03:39] person or the party who first tries to
[03:42] build a government uh but he cannot
[03:46] really do anything in that like he he
[03:48] he's more representative for okay here
[03:52] in Brazil it's kind of similar to the
[03:53] United
[03:54] States uh we have a president he has
[03:58] some kind of power yeah but the issue is
[04:01] that if he stays for longer than four
[04:03] years if he's reelected and in our case
[04:07] the current president had been reelected
[04:09] in the past he has already been
[04:11] president for eight years now he's he's
[04:14] got four more so not 12 in a row but 12
[04:17] in total so we had another present in
[04:20] between but the issue is that this
[04:22] present was the one who elected all the
[04:26] guys from the the the Supreme Courts so
[04:29] so any ruling that people say no that's
[04:33] unconstitutional the president cannot uh
[04:35] sign on that he just say okay let's
[04:39] decide the let's let the Supreme Court
[04:41] rule and the Supreme Court will always
[04:43] favor this President because he was the
[04:45] one who picked these guys 10 years ago
[04:49] so it's kind of living in a monarchy
[04:52] it's it's
[04:53] crazy whatever he wants he can do even
[04:56] if it's not constitutional it's
[04:58] fascinating to see politics it's like in
[04:59] AUST also the president is usually there
[05:02] for 12 years because one period is six
[05:06] years H and it's like almost always I
[05:11] think there was rarely the instant where
[05:13] the president cannot be reelected and
[05:15] the maximum is two periods so six by two
[05:20] uh and almost every president I don't
[05:22] even know if there was ever a president
[05:24] who was not 12 years there uh he he's
[05:28] there for 12 years and usually it's a
[05:30] really old guy like the
[05:33] president is usually older guys but I'm
[05:37] I'm not as uh um Keen to talk about
[05:41] Austrian history of of politics I know a
[05:44] little bit about the last like five
[05:45] years because I was engaged in the
[05:47] Austrian politics a lot but then with
[05:49] Bitcoin my focus shifted a lot towards
[05:52] Bitcoin and and less towards politics is
[05:55] it also on your side like are you how do
[05:58] you see politics when you have Bitcoin I
[06:00] used to support the liberal candidates
[06:03] and the liberal parties in Brazil I used
[06:05] to give them money go out on Ries and
[06:07] stuff like that but I felt like dude
[06:11] we're not making a change there's like
[06:13] in the lower house there's
[06:17] 520s congressmen like even if we elect
[06:21] 20 which is going to be a miracle it's
[06:24] not going to change anything but we
[06:26] because we're going to be less than 5%
[06:28] of the lower house and on the on the
[06:31] Upper House the Senate there are like 22
[06:34] Senators if we elect one or two it would
[06:37] be a miracle so we're not going to make
[06:38] a change from there so I found out about
[06:42] Bitcoin well I find out I started to to
[06:46] to accumulate some Bitcoin and and I'll
[06:49] talk about that later but I started my
[06:52] life in Bitcoin in
[06:54] 2017 so like six months later I was
[06:58] thinking to myself well if there's a way
[07:00] to change the government and more
[07:03] importantly to change what people
[07:06] understand and perceive about the
[07:08] government I'm not talking about only
[07:09] Fiat money it could be gold could be the
[07:13] the base man I don't care but people
[07:17] think that there there's no way out from
[07:20] the Govern system they think no our only
[07:23] way to get Representatives is on the
[07:25] vote there's no way out either we vote
[07:28] for the left or for the right right for
[07:30] the center there's no for viable option
[07:33] we cannot tell them ah I don't agree
[07:35] with this system you should not be
[07:36] taking 50% of my earnings to do whatever
[07:39] I I don't want so after I really
[07:42] understood Bitcoin and it took like six
[07:44] to eight months after I started in
[07:47] 2017 then I said it makes no longer
[07:50] sense to be involved in politics in any
[07:52] way even if it's to say I don't trust
[07:56] this system I don't like the system we
[07:57] should look for alternatives then I
[08:00] understood that if we change the money
[08:03] if we don't no longer let the power of
[08:06] the money printer with the governments
[08:08] then their mandate is automatically over
[08:11] they're going to be like your presence
[08:13] yeah they can sign they can go to
[08:14] ceremonies and Etc but they don't have
[08:17] the money to do to build the roads and
[08:19] to do hospitals and do everything saying
[08:22] to the people yeah we're helping you
[08:24] we're the good guys we're the government
[08:26] without us there wouldn't be streets
[08:28] there wouldn't be ambulance there
[08:30] wouldn't be schools so when people
[08:33] perceive understand that the money is
[08:35] the the power is on the money side and
[08:38] the best way to cut them out of the job
[08:41] is to search for alternative money
[08:43] transmitting systems then I said I'm out
[08:46] of politics yeah it it's it's it's um
[08:50] for me similar uh the only thing that
[08:54] changed is the last six to eight months
[08:58] I heard so many stories about El
[08:59] Salvador and na gave me a little bit
[09:03] hope that there if if there is a really
[09:07] good guy who who could actually do
[09:09] something uh it it it's possible to move
[09:13] something in a
[09:14] country and I don't know if this will
[09:16] ever be possible in other other
[09:18] countries I don't know if long term this
[09:20] will even be good for El Salvador like I
[09:23] I like the direction where they are
[09:24] going but nobody knows how it will look
[09:27] in 10 years like El Sal came from a
[09:30] really shitty place but they're moving
[09:32] in a good direction but how will this
[09:34] look in 10 years but from what I see it
[09:37] give me a little bit a little bit hope
[09:39] back in politics but but maybe I'm I'm
[09:42] Dreaming are you talking mostly about
[09:44] the crime it and the the how it affects
[09:49] people as
[09:51] Society the day-to-day living or as the
[09:54] economy GDP and Etc the big numbers or
[09:58] how is the qu of life of the small
[10:00] people what what do you think that
[10:02] changed
[10:03] most in I think in El Salvador the the
[10:08] the biggest thing that I mean I was
[10:10] never there like that's I have to I have
[10:12] to say that I I interviewed like 10 15
[10:15] people already on the podcast who uh
[10:18] moved there from other countries or was
[10:21] were already there and they're currently
[10:23] living in in in El Salvador so I think I
[10:26] have some grasp on the on what's going
[10:28] on in El Salvador but not a full grasp
[10:30] because I never was really there um and
[10:33] the biggest thing I always hear from
[10:34] people when they talk about in Salvador
[10:36] who were actually there is the main
[10:38] thing that happened is
[10:40] security uh they they said like there
[10:43] are less security guards in front of the
[10:45] stores uh they have a um higher
[10:49] subjective feeling of security in the
[10:52] country um and they they see um a little
[10:56] like El salvadorians are more proud uh
[10:59] again about businesses about stuff like
[11:03] that so because they can all of the
[11:04] sudden I know this this this one story
[11:07] who was told to me um where a guy had a
[11:11] shop for science like he sold science
[11:14] and he did not even have a sign because
[11:16] he was robbed so many times so only
[11:18] people who could find him uh when when
[11:21] they actually actually knew him uh but
[11:24] because he did not had a sign nobody
[11:26] could see him but now he has no security
[11:29] guard he can put the signs up and
[11:31] there's a lower risk of of being robbed
[11:34] so I think security is the main thing it
[11:36] has nothing to do with Bitcoin actually
[11:38] uh I don't I don't think it has
[11:40] something to do with Bitcoin maybe I'm
[11:42] wrong but uh this is the main thing I
[11:44] always hear from Salvador and that that
[11:46] that actually
[11:47] changed yeah I think I I the main
[11:51] concern I have is the same as you yeah
[11:54] criminality went down there's model of
[11:57] forign uh uh
[12:00] not only tourists but people willing to
[12:02] do business there because Community went
[12:04] down but I don't think that has anything
[12:06] to do with Bitcoin and when you ask the
[12:08] locals if they are transacting in
[12:11] Bitcoin no they aren't they they accept
[12:14] Bitcoin via their Cho wallet or whatever
[12:17] app but it's automatically converted to
[12:19] US dollars so it's still a dollarized
[12:22] economy I don't think it change much
[12:26] when you think about GDP terms on how
[12:29] you can take people out of poverty and
[12:32] stuff like that if those things happen
[12:35] and I think they did it's because of
[12:38] crime stopping measures he put 1% of the
[12:41] people in in jail or whatever but it has
[12:45] little to do with Bitcoin especially
[12:46] when you check that very few of them
[12:50] effective save in Bitcoin and they're
[12:53] mostly transaction in US Dollars using
[12:56] the Bitcoin lighting Network or whatever
[12:58] but transac in dollars and saving in
[13:00] dollars not saving Bitcoin so I don't
[13:02] think that Bitcoin is
[13:05] the the biggest thing happening there
[13:07] the biggest thing Happ been there as you
[13:09] said is more a focused president or
[13:12] country that said we're going to
[13:14] stop criminality maybe not the big Narco
[13:18] traffic but at least the the small guys
[13:21] we're going to make the streets more
[13:22] safe so yeah it's a good thing I think
[13:26] it's good that he inviting other
[13:28] presents from around the world to
[13:30] discuss about Bitcoin and why the
[13:32] country is investing Bitcoin but if you
[13:34] check the country's uh total reserves he
[13:39] only last time I checked he invested
[13:42] like 4% of the reserves in Bitcoin yeah
[13:46] it's like I don't
[13:48] know $250 million yeah yeah but the
[13:52] country's Reserve is like 10 times more
[13:54] than that because they have oil
[13:56] production uh so the reserves are still
[13:59] in gold in US Treasures or in shares of
[14:04] companies or whatever but it's less than
[14:06] 5% last time I checked that was in
[14:09] Bitcoin so I think yeah it's a small
[14:11] step it's in the right direction but I
[14:14] don't think that's going to be the
[14:15] what's going to explode Bitcoin adoption
[14:18] from for the population and for other
[14:21] governs the other governs will go there
[14:22] and say well this is promising I want to
[14:24] copy this this this maybe I'm going to
[14:26] allocate 1% of my reserves to bitcoin
[14:29] not three or 4% like you did so yeah
[14:31] it's positive but I don't think that's
[14:33] the the biggest biggest advertisers for
[14:36] Bitcoin success I don't think
[14:39] so absolutely and and uh I always try to
[14:43] mention that Bitcoin doesn't need El
[14:45] Salvador definitely like El Salvador has
[14:47] not a huge impact uh on on bitcoin right
[14:51] now at least um if bit Sal gets to be a
[14:56] really great success story uh and it can
[15:00] like it it all started with when they
[15:02] adopted Bitcoin and in 10 years they're
[15:04] like a really rich country because
[15:05] Bitcoin companies come in there maybe
[15:07] talents come in there and that's like
[15:08] one thing that you did not mention till
[15:10] now it's like it had some marketing
[15:13] effects like uh we we talk now about El
[15:16] Salvador uh which we probably would not
[15:18] do if they would not had to do anything
[15:21] with Bitcoin so it has some some
[15:24] marketing effects uh but the
[15:27] long-term uh success of that is not only
[15:31] depending on bitcoin it's on depending
[15:34] on the um execution of them being able
[15:39] to get people their skilled people into
[15:42] the country and good companies in the
[15:45] count to actually really uh do it or do
[15:47] you see it differently I think that I
[15:51] like the micro strategy way if you
[15:53] believe in Bitcoin you don't buy 3% you
[15:56] buy 100% you get the max depth you can
[16:00] get in feat terms and you also use that
[16:03] proceeds to buy more Bitcoin it's not
[16:05] allocating 5% or 10% in your reserves
[16:09] that you're going to catapult a a small
[16:12] poor country to a top 40 or top 50
[16:16] economy it's not going to happen that
[16:18] way uh uh so Brazil for take Brazil for
[16:22] example we don't have external debt we
[16:25] paid that long ago we're even creditors
[16:27] to the FMI
[16:29] but believe it or not 100% of our
[16:33] reserves we have 300 billion doll
[16:38] reserves 100% of them are allocated in
[16:41] US
[16:42] treasures and I got to remind you that
[16:46] the current sitting president and most
[16:48] of Brazilians as well are more aligned
[16:51] with Russia and China than with United
[16:54] States we have several issues on the how
[16:59] say the the world we call it onu the
[17:02] world organization where they they vote
[17:04] if they're going to support Palestinians
[17:06] or israelian if if they're go vote they
[17:08] gonna sanction the Russians every time
[17:12] Brazil votes against sanctioning
[17:14] Russians against sanction in China
[17:16] against sanction in Palestine or Brazil
[17:20] is never aligned United States on those
[17:22] questions and yet 100% of money is in US
[17:26] Treasury it really makes no sense
[17:29] they're waiting for a problem when a day
[17:33] when United States is going to sell is
[17:35] going to say hey either you start voting
[17:38] with us you you are one of the 20
[17:41] biggest Economist in the world so if you
[17:43] you're going to start working with us or
[17:45] we're going to confiscate his
[17:47] money we're if we're not six months into
[17:50] that we are three or four years but
[17:53] Brazil is doing the dumbest thing they
[17:55] can
[17:56] do it's I never I never heard that I'm
[17:59] I'm I'm I'm not that good with macro
[18:01] themes but I really love that you said
[18:03] that El Salvador is not bullish enough
[18:06] because I also see it like that 4% is
[18:10] almost I mean it's a interesting
[18:11] strategy it's more like a marketing and
[18:14] symbolic G when they invest like one
[18:16] Bitcoin a day and you see in the nice
[18:18] charts and they make it public uh but
[18:22] obviously 4% is is not a lot there are
[18:25] many individuals uh maybe even like
[18:28] watching now that have more Bitcoin than
[18:30] them not many but there are there are
[18:32] some individuals that have have more
[18:34] than than than H Salvador so uh it it's
[18:37] interesting to see this all playing out
[18:40] um the first topic that I actually
[18:43] wanted to get into that I actually had
[18:45] to plan for today um was when I went to
[18:49] I always go to Twitter profiles of of
[18:52] people because T is like my my main main
[18:54] platform that I am and I Lov your the
[18:57] banner with the choker picture where it
[18:59] says like it's not about the money it's
[19:01] about the message I love that so much uh
[19:04] and just to to enter here um what what
[19:08] what do you think is like the main
[19:09] message about Bitcoin and why is it so
[19:12] important I think I used to be uh I
[19:15] don't know if you call it in English
[19:17] liberal but not not Center not left not
[19:20] right I think we should have the least
[19:22] govern possible they should not be
[19:24] intervening on our
[19:26] lives uh but prior to joining Bitcoin I
[19:30] used to support those movements and
[19:32] thinking well maybe if elect 10
[19:34] officials or 20 officials who going to
[19:36] be able to make change and then I when I
[19:39] after I understood Bitcoin and I saw its
[19:42] potential not only as a digital gold or
[19:44] whatever because we're usually dragged
[19:47] by the potential of getting rich we
[19:50] shouldn't try to hide this I entered
[19:53] Bitcoin I really entered Bitcoin because
[19:55] I thought well this can go to a million
[19:58] dollar two2 million I'm going to get
[20:00] rich but after seven seven years you can
[20:03] see that I still live on the same house
[20:04] and nothing changed so I'm not
[20:06] rich uh but the thing is I
[20:09] understood that if we want to change the
[20:13] system we need to give the population a
[20:17] tool that it's easy and that they can
[20:20] see some
[20:22] benefit people are not going to change
[20:24] because of of a 5x benefit well the you
[20:28] have the the your do digital dollar the
[20:30] Teter or the usdc coin but Bitcoin is
[20:33] better because it's more
[20:35] decentralized and you don't need an
[20:38] intermediate uh and if the US government
[20:40] wants to confiscate it the the tets or
[20:43] the US usdc coins they can take the
[20:46] treasuries or the the money in the bank
[20:49] and they're going to lose money people
[20:50] don't really care for that I I 95% of
[20:53] the people right now they don't care for
[20:56] that even if it's a five time better
[20:59] they they're not going to change from
[21:01] the system they do believe that the US
[21:03] dollar is relative stable as an economy
[21:07] they have a strong Army to defend their
[21:09] interests and Etc they do believe in the
[21:11] Euro region because it's like 20
[21:14] countries they can somehow if United
[21:18] States I'm not not going to support
[21:19] Europe anymore you're going to have to
[21:21] buy things from China and Russia Europe
[21:23] can manage it so people believe they
[21:26] have the wrong perception that money is
[21:29] going to be there in 20 year time
[21:31] because the government or whatever or
[21:33] the Army is going to be there to support
[21:35] them but once you implement for in for
[21:38] example the
[21:39] cbdc and the government tells the guy
[21:42] well you can only travel abroad two
[21:44] times because of carbon footprint oh you
[21:47] can only buy two kilos of meat every
[21:50] month otherwise you're going to block
[21:52] your money you can only it's cbdc we can
[21:55] tell you what you can buy or what you
[21:56] cannot buy or you you you like porn hub
[22:00] and you pay a sub subscription but we
[22:02] don't think here in austa people should
[22:04] be paying for porn it's not cool so I'm
[22:07] going to avoid payments to Pornhub or
[22:10] whatever you do so when you make when
[22:14] you force when you push the little guy
[22:16] out of his
[22:18] limits I don't think that bitcoiners
[22:22] are representative of the
[22:25] population people who are already in
[22:27] Bitcoin and already in [ __ ] already
[22:30] had a a predisposal to be more angry
[22:34] with what the government do but most of
[22:36] the populations my cousins my father my
[22:40] my mother my uncle they they think that
[22:44] well maybe we don't need the government
[22:46] but the other way it's Anarchy it's
[22:49] going to be much worse we're going to
[22:51] have the milias it's going to become
[22:53] like Honduras people with guns on the
[22:55] streets and Etc and we' seen countries
[22:59] in Latin America that went that way
[23:01] because of but those militias were
[23:03] funded by the CIA and Etc we know that
[23:06] there's no way a couple of Five Guys in
[23:09] Honduras happen to have Land Rovers and
[23:12] 50 caliber guns and Etc they don't have
[23:14] money for that somebody gave them
[23:17] somebody trained them so we know that
[23:20] this is Cia funded this is fat money
[23:23] problem it's not going to happen in
[23:24] Brazil we are kind of a poor country
[23:26] like 60% of our population
[23:29] live with less than I know $150 $180 a
[23:34] month 60% of the population live with
[23:36] less than $108 a month we are a really
[23:39] poor country at the same time we have
[23:42] 20% of the population or 10% of the
[23:44] population at least that lives with I
[23:47] don't know $4,000 or over we have both
[23:50] we have a really rich country here I
[23:53] don't know 20 million people and we have
[23:55] 120 million people who are extremely
[23:57] poor and and the rest is the middle
[23:59] class but we have both sides here so I
[24:03] don't think that the the guys who are
[24:05] getting four or $5,000 per month are
[24:07] worried about any of that they have the
[24:10] cars they can travel they can go to
[24:12] restaurants their life is good they're
[24:14] not going to complain they're not going
[24:15] to try to overthrow governments they're
[24:17] not going to try to to create a
[24:19] different uh Fe a different payment
[24:22] system whether in gold or Bitcoin
[24:23] they're not just their life is good so I
[24:26] think the the what's going to be the
[24:28] game changer is when the little guy the
[24:30] middle class who now can travel Who Now
[24:33] can do stuff buy stuff online or go to
[24:36] restaurant and enjoy his leisure time
[24:40] when the government forces him and say
[24:42] no you cannot do that because of carbon
[24:44] foodprint you cannot do that because of
[24:46] the new covid you cannot do that because
[24:48] we're not friendly United States anymore
[24:50] so you cannot go to Disney you cannot
[24:52] subscribe to Amazon to to whatever you
[24:54] like you're not going to be able to do
[24:56] that then this guy is going to look for
[24:58] an alternative then this guy is going to
[25:01] come begging for Bitcoin it doesn't
[25:02] matter if the price is $60,000 or
[25:06] $600,000 he's opting out of the Fiat
[25:09] system but we need something to push him
[25:12] out and on the other side we also need a
[25:15] better ux for the average user they're
[25:17] not going to be able to write down seeds
[25:20] and stuff like that and wallets I don't
[25:22] think that's for the majority I think
[25:24] that's the backbone that should happen
[25:27] without the user knowing that he has
[25:30] wallets he has seeds and Etc maybe some
[25:33] eye monitor I don't know but we should
[25:35] have easier solutions for the most of
[25:37] the population right now it's a good
[25:41] back backend system it's not ready for
[25:44] mainstream if you are listening to this
[25:46] podcast you might be wondering what is
[25:48] actually the setup look like of Robin or
[25:51] how can I improve my Bitcoin setup and
[25:53] there's two things you have to buy
[25:55] Bitcoin from the right source and you
[25:57] have to store bit Bitcoin the right way
[25:59] let's focus on the first thing how to
[26:01] buy Bitcoin it's simple have a Bitcoin
[26:04] only exchange don't deal with the
[26:06] shitcoin exchanges don't deal with an
[26:07] exchange that has an own token or
[26:09] something like that be on a Bitcoin only
[26:12] exchange I use 21 Bitcoin 21 Bitcoin is
[26:15] for me the best partner for that and now
[26:18] where do you store Bitcoin Bitcoin
[26:20] should be stored on a hardware wallet on
[26:22] a self custody solution where you
[26:26] yourself hold your keys and it should be
[26:28] a cold wallet so that's my Simple
[26:32] Solutions that's a bitbox you just put
[26:34] your Bitcoin on there back up your seat
[26:37] phas and you are better than 95% of all
[26:41] Bitcoin hodlers if you have more than
[26:43] ,000 in Bitcoin it's an absolutely must
[26:46] have one last thing before we get back
[26:48] to the video I'm really passionate about
[26:50] meeting other bitcoiners and there's an
[26:53] amazing opportunity in middle of Europe
[26:56] in June the Bitcoin br conference it's
[26:59] the best and biggest Bitcoin only
[27:02] conference in whole of Europe for all
[27:04] Americans please visit Europe and visit
[27:06] this place in June for all europees it's
[27:09] a must go anyways you're so close to the
[27:12] Bitcoin PR conference you basically have
[27:14] to come I will do interviews there and I
[27:16] would love to meet you all there use
[27:19] code Robin for all my sponsors to get
[27:22] discounts and use the links down in the
[27:24] description yeah definitely we we we are
[27:27] so early and I that so many times like
[27:29] we need so much more development
[27:31] especially on on the front end side of
[27:34] things because
[27:36] um like when we compare it to the
[27:39] internet Revolution what's happened with
[27:41] with email for example in the early days
[27:43] of email everybody thought uh the
[27:46] everybody will run an own email server
[27:49] nobody runs their own email server
[27:51] everybody's on on on gmail which leads
[27:54] me a little bit to the the next question
[27:56] like how how will this bit adoption do
[27:58] you think will will will end up is is
[28:00] self- custody uh I mean we know that
[28:04] main chain like uh onchain transaction
[28:07] uh will be a thing of like maybe five
[28:09] million maybe 10 million institutions or
[28:11] individuals because at some point you
[28:13] will be priced out uh but will be self-
[28:17] custody uh and something uh that we on
[28:21] this privacy and coin mixing and all the
[28:23] stuff that goes on right now with
[28:25] hardcore bitcoiners will this be always
[28:28] is like a niche thing because the
[28:30] majority just does not care about those
[28:32] things I don't know if you know the
[28:34] history of the computer bulletin board
[28:36] systems
[28:37] cbbs I used to own one in Brazil uh I
[28:41] had a a computer my home four computers
[28:44] with four modems each one and 16 lines
[28:48] of telephone 16 land lines so people
[28:51] would call to my server at my house so
[28:54] they could chat they could share games
[28:57] profiles games online stuff like that so
[29:00] that's prior to the internet we call
[29:03] that cbbs computer bloting board system
[29:06] that used to be my one R run until 996 I
[29:11] think my father started in 198 84 or
[29:16] 85 he worked for two years then we had a
[29:19] Yos of six years then I come back in I
[29:22] don't know 90 so I ran for another five
[29:25] years and I would show that to my
[29:28] friends and they they said well it's
[29:30] interesting but I'm going to need to buy
[29:32] a modem I cannot use the landline phone
[29:35] from my house because my dad is going to
[29:37] be angry with me if I'm on the phone on
[29:38] the modem all the time uh I like the
[29:41] games but the games a little bit text
[29:43] based and to download the file it takes
[29:46] like two days I can go downstairs and
[29:49] buy the the the CD with the game in five
[29:52] minutes so people saw the technology
[29:55] they said well it's good it's prom pring
[29:58] but it doesn't work for me so out of my
[30:01] don't know 50 friends I had two of them
[30:04] who also enjoyed to use my BBS and we go
[30:08] to to meetings and we talk online and we
[30:10] play this text based games and Etc then
[30:14] all of a sudden in
[30:15] 1997 the internet came to Brazil or came
[30:19] to the broader part of the
[30:21] population so everything changed
[30:24] everybody was using the IR IRC or I c
[30:28] key messing in chats everybody was using
[30:31] file
[30:33] transferring protocols like torrent and
[30:35] ftps to download games and Etc that the
[30:39] everybody was playing games online even
[30:41] it was Doom or simple games that was not
[30:44] very complex game but let graphic games
[30:47] so it was basically the same thing that
[30:49] we had been doing for the past years for
[30:51] the past 10 years they were starting to
[30:53] do on the Internet it's like WhatsApp in
[30:57] Brazil like everybody has WhatsApp the
[30:59] maid The Nanny my father my grandfather
[31:02] everybody has WhatsApp because it's easy
[31:04] to use yeah there's encryption in
[31:07] WhatsApp there's WhatsApp pay they can
[31:09] send money in in WhatsApp and probably
[31:12] there's even an app that you can
[31:14] integrate a lighting wallet to Whatsapp
[31:16] it's going to read your message and send
[31:18] M money to you send 10,000 sets to Robin
[31:22] please it's going to connect with my
[31:23] wallet and do it so yeah there's lot of
[31:26] technology in there but people for them
[31:29] it's easy app to do so what I think for
[31:32] Bitcoin that sometime in the future
[31:35] there'll be a more integration to the
[31:37] apps that they're already used to and
[31:39] the wallet will be connected so
[31:41] transparent that they don't even know
[31:43] that they are using a Bitcoin
[31:46] wallet where where would you say are we
[31:49] in this uh in this development I feel
[31:51] like when we compare it to the internet
[31:54] um
[31:55] Revolution we are I feel like before the
[31:58] 2000.com Buble where a lot of things
[32:01] started uh but it's hard to say where
[32:03] exactly we are what would you say where
[32:05] where we
[32:06] are I would say we are on the we're not
[32:09] on the internet ER era yet that's what
[32:11] I'm talking we are not into 1997 we're
[32:14] still in 1993 1994 because to use you
[32:18] have to learn how to use the seats you
[32:20] have to learn how to manage to send
[32:22] onchain to offchain and Etc you have to
[32:25] learn about custody it's not
[32:29] it's not going to cut for 95% of the
[32:31] population we're not going to get to 10
[32:34] you know that the graph of the chasm
[32:36] adoption there's a Chasm between 9 and
[32:38] 11% we're not going to cross the chasm
[32:41] until we have a much better ux and it's
[32:44] not like a faster wallet or cheaper
[32:47] transactions ain't any anything like
[32:50] that we need stuff that the regular my
[32:53] mate my nanny they can use without even
[32:56] knowing how the technology works
[32:58] they just select well out of my paycheck
[33:01] I want 5% to be invested in
[33:04] Bitcoin that's it they're not going to
[33:06] do anything more than that I think even
[33:08] sometimes that um people will not even
[33:11] really know that Bitcoin is is
[33:13] underneath everything it will be like
[33:16] more like the tcpip protocol where
[33:18] people like uh yeah I know that when I
[33:22] send my WhatsApp message and it gives
[33:24] this little ticks that yeah he got it
[33:27] but how many people can actually explain
[33:29] what's going on in the background how
[33:31] this message is actually sent to the
[33:33] other client so uh yeah it's it will be
[33:36] really interesting and um I I always try
[33:39] to educate everybody around me about
[33:41] self custy about all the Bitcoin things
[33:44] also about the nerdy stuff just because
[33:45] I'm passionate about but I know it will
[33:49] probably as I see it and as you see it
[33:52] uh it will be not something that
[33:54] everybody does but it's great that we
[33:56] have that uh possibility and have this
[33:59] transparency and have this control for
[34:01] those people who actually want that and
[34:04] this is one thing that uh that really is
[34:06] is cool how is um in as we talked a
[34:09] little bit about Brazil how is the
[34:11] adoption going in there as Brazil is a
[34:14] country that would need Bitcoin a lot as
[34:18] every country but Brazil
[34:20] also there was an interesting research
[34:22] that came out uh I don't know one or two
[34:24] months ago uh don't byy The Brokerage
[34:28] the the tra traditional brokerage they
[34:30] found out that about I don't know six or
[34:34] seven million Brazilians have
[34:36] traditional Investments either funds or
[34:39] share stocks or government bonds like 7
[34:43] million and the number of Brazilians uh
[34:46] playing uh video I don't know how to
[34:49] call the SP not only sporting bats but
[34:52] batting batting
[34:54] applications that you have casinos that
[34:56] you have dice that you have sports or
[34:58] whatever was 21 million
[35:01] Brazilians so it's three times more
[35:05] Brazilians going on BS Sports BS or
[35:08] casinos and Etc online versus investing
[35:12] on whatever funds uh bonds or
[35:15] stocks so it's it's not fair to say that
[35:20] Brazilians do not have money to invest
[35:22] or they do not have the education or
[35:24] they do not have the the the mobile
[35:26] phones or they have all of that they
[35:29] know how to use it but they don't see
[35:33] that investing is going to take them
[35:35] from poverty to being uh medium class or
[35:39] from going from middle class to being
[35:41] rich they think out that's only for uh
[35:43] wealthy people it's a rigged game I'm
[35:46] not it's not worthy for me but when you
[35:49] try to explain Bitcoin well Bitcoin
[35:51] opposes everything like that it's more
[35:54] like a digital real estate or digital
[35:56] oil or R TR to Spain and and the guy
[35:59] says well but what can I buy with
[36:01] Bitcoin they're they're really focused
[36:03] on short term what's the potential gain
[36:06] for the next two months and I say
[36:08] potentially you're going to lose 50%
[36:10] because of volatility and that's how it
[36:12] works so if you're not ready to lose 50%
[36:15] you're never going to get the the 5x
[36:17] gains in in five to 10 years they're not
[36:20] interested in it because they're too
[36:22] focused on short term so and the big
[36:25] question is why cannot they
[36:28] uh uh create a a small account with 100
[36:31] r or $20 every month and just sit and
[36:35] waight because they learned via 40 Years
[36:39] of Fiat money that that if you put money
[36:42] on a investment or you put money under
[36:45] the couch in 20 year time that money is
[36:48] going to be
[36:49] worthless they they were forced to
[36:54] change their mentality to either I spend
[36:58] the money over the next six months or I
[37:01] invest in something really risky if I
[37:03] want to do a a
[37:05] 5x they're really afraid of having money
[37:09] sitting on an investment for 20 or 20
[37:12] year 10 or 20 years even if it's
[37:14] government bonds or stocks because in
[37:17] the past the government has already
[37:19] confiscated money that was sitting in
[37:20] the banks in the past our fixed income
[37:24] that used to pay down know 40% per year
[37:26] suddenly
[37:28] because of a rule change was paying like
[37:31] half of that because the government said
[37:33] well we're going to be broke so we're
[37:34] going to need to change the law so from
[37:36] now on we're going to pay less on the
[37:38] treasur bonds so we had those not that
[37:42] those happened over the last 20 years
[37:44] they did not okay in the past 20 years
[37:47] our only problem was inflation going
[37:49] from 4% to I don't know 12 133% or 15 or
[37:54] whatever uh but money confiscation
[37:57] happened over 20 years ago so people are
[37:59] afraid of doing anything that I tell
[38:02] them you're going to have to sit and
[38:03] wait 10 years for Bitcoin he's not going
[38:05] to do it because he doesn't trust Fiat
[38:07] he doesn't trust government and he
[38:08] doesn't understand that Bitcoin is
[38:10] completely apart from it's funny for me
[38:12] how uh when I speak with people and I
[38:15] love that example with the online
[38:18] gambling and and with the the
[38:20] traditional Finance because when I speak
[38:23] with people the the one person that's
[38:27] the those persons who are playing the
[38:29] lottery are those persons who say
[38:32] Bitcoin is too risky and have all those
[38:36] like concerns about it and I was like
[38:39] H like literally like when you bet a 10
[38:43] yearo and it's like oh but it's only 10
[38:45] EUR but yeah how how often are you doing
[38:47] it and I see a lot of Lottery players
[38:50] they play the lottery usually uh
[38:52] regularly they don't like oh I play one
[38:55] once a year or like I I I play like I
[38:58] did once and never did it again they
[39:00] usually play like every month some even
[39:03] every day some even every week and when
[39:05] you play like every week with two three
[39:07] Euros uh put those two three Euros uh
[39:11] like for example when we when we take
[39:13] this example with Bitcoin because I know
[39:15] the numbers actually uh when you would
[39:17] have put 10 EUR a week the last 10 years
[39:21] in Bitcoin this would be an inv
[39:24] investment of
[39:25] 5,200 euros but it would been a total
[39:29] value now of over 300,000
[39:33] EUR and and this 10 years A lot of
[39:36] people are just gambling on lottery
[39:38] tickets to might get a big win of like
[39:41] two million but this win of 2 million
[39:45] the chances are so low they they will
[39:48] never happen for
[39:50] you never there's one guy that that that
[39:53] they happen to but it the chances are so
[39:56] low it's not risky bat like there not
[39:58] even a risky bat it's an impossible bat
[40:01] uh what what you're taking just take
[40:03] like 10 EUR out of of out of your salary
[40:06] every week and put it in something that
[40:08] is not risky like like like Bitcoin but
[40:12] yeah it's it's it's fascinating for me
[40:13] how how how people see that how do you
[40:17] um what do you think do we have to
[40:20] overcome that the mainstream is adopting
[40:24] Bitcoin is is it just the price action
[40:27] uh that uh that we has to see but what
[40:29] what is it I think first of all the ux
[40:32] but I like I said it's like how WhatsApp
[40:36] is today compared to what the Computing
[40:39] buting board system used to be you you
[40:41] needed to have mement you need to have a
[40:44] land line a phone line connected to
[40:46] computer you need to dial to the
[40:48] computer BBS you had to pay some I don't
[40:51] know fees to use the BBS some of them to
[40:54] change message it was not easy to reach
[40:56] people outside of your city because
[40:59] calling to other regions would be more
[41:01] expensive in Brazil but once you had
[41:03] internet once you had WhatsApp doing a
[41:06] phone call or send sending a text to a
[41:08] to a guy who is 100 meters away or a
[41:12] th000 kilometers away it's the same
[41:13] price so it's more easier and cheaper to
[41:16] use but I don't think it's if it's a
[41:19] lighting Network getting more developed
[41:22] or uh uh more secure or another way of
[41:25] transaction using do Federated chains I
[41:29] don't think it's any of that okay I
[41:31] think it's integrating the Bitcoin as a
[41:35] backbone to the current banking system
[41:38] or whatever people already have so in
[41:42] your app account of the bank you're
[41:44] going to be able to have dollars Bitcoin
[41:48] ethereum Brazilian r or some token
[41:51] issued by the bank that when people have
[41:54] more libert Liberty to choose what they
[41:57] want they're going to constantly be
[41:59] checking
[42:00] well if I change it from 50% in dollars
[42:04] and 50% in r two years ago if I had 10%
[42:08] in Bitcoin 40% in dollar and 50% in in R
[42:13] I would be much more wealthier then this
[42:15] guy is going to start doing the change
[42:18] when it's on the same app of the banking
[42:21] system the one he transacts to France
[42:23] the one he pays the bills the one he
[42:25] does everything because if we are going
[42:27] to expect the shops and uh my landlord
[42:32] to accept Bitcoin for payment for a
[42:35] circular economy to happen it's like the
[42:38] dog trying to wag his tail to bite his
[42:41] tail the that adoption is not happening
[42:44] because people see no use then adoption
[42:46] is not it's not going to change if the
[42:48] price is $70,000 or
[42:50] $700,000 it's not about that as I said I
[42:54] have a good example my M was one of the
[42:56] last customers of Blockbuster in Brazil
[43:00] he he was she was a strong opponent of
[43:03] Netflix and streaming service simply
[43:06] because she doesn't work she's uh
[43:09] retired and the thing she like enjoys
[43:12] most in life is going to the supermarket
[43:14] going to the pharmacy used to go to the
[43:17] video Club to discuss with the guys who
[43:18] work there about the videos she liked or
[43:20] not and stuff like that she likes to go
[43:23] to the bank she likes to talk to the
[43:25] manager but this new generation that is
[43:28] coming people that have uh less than 30
[43:32] 35 years old they they cannot see
[43:35] themselves going to a video store they
[43:38] not not see themselves going to a bank
[43:40] or going to to to the supermarket
[43:43] instead of shopping online so we need a
[43:45] generational shift like Moses when they
[43:49] took the Jews out of the slavery he
[43:53] didn't walk for 40 years in the desert
[43:55] because of nothing
[43:57] he walked because he wanted the slaves
[43:59] to die and to have a new geration that
[44:01] was already Born
[44:03] Free so the people who are living with
[44:06] us are slaves to the Fiat money it's not
[44:10] going to be some 10x Improvement that
[44:13] it's going to make them out of the
[44:14] system like my mother only stayed out of
[44:18] Blockbuster when the last shop in their
[44:20] neighborhood the last V VHS tape or DVD
[44:23] tape closed otherwise she would still be
[44:26] using that I know
[44:29] her I love that so much uh and and it's
[44:33] very true because when I talk with
[44:35] people uh there are some that are
[44:38] already in there and they because they
[44:40] deeply research and they go in there and
[44:42] they were kind of primed to that whole
[44:44] thing but then there Al those people who
[44:47] are open to it but they're really
[44:49] cautious and they they are on the verge
[44:51] they like the the the the the adopters
[44:55] the early adopters but like on the on
[44:57] the later stage I don't know what the
[44:58] second wave is is called on on that on
[45:01] that graph but there are so many people
[45:04] who who who will not accept the money
[45:07] who's not from the government any
[45:10] anytime soon and that's uh that's kind
[45:12] of sad to see but I totally agree with
[45:15] you on on on the retail side
[45:18] um how is that different from a nation
[45:22] state is because when like a nation
[45:24] state uh thinks differently than than an
[45:27] individual person uh and like El
[45:30] Salvador started it a little bit or way
[45:33] to bearish as we discussed earlier uh
[45:36] but at least they're doing something and
[45:37] they're public about it they they are
[45:39] like kind of starting this this game
[45:41] theory uh a little bit how do you see
[45:44] that playing out on on nation states uh
[45:46] buying Bitcoin if it's a small nation
[45:48] like if Brazil tomorrow says well we
[45:51] have $300 billion we're going to dump
[45:53] the treasures and buy Bitcoin or gold or
[45:56] Russ and Chinese stable coin or whatever
[46:00] what do you think is going to happen on
[46:01] the next day the us is going to cut
[46:04] relations with Brazil it's going to
[46:06] start some kind of embargo it's going to
[46:08] raise tariffs for Brazilians to export
[46:11] to us and then the Brazilian economy
[46:13] will go down instead of going up because
[46:17] it's un imagable to be outside not be
[46:21] able to sell to the biggest economy in
[46:23] the world you Brazil would simply they
[46:27] lose like I don't know 20% of their
[46:29] exports overnight or maybe even even
[46:32] more and when you talk about importing
[46:34] technology we are also dependent from
[46:36] United States you can see that well
[46:39] maybe in five years China and other
[46:40] regions will be able to uh uh to surpass
[46:44] that and to provide technology maybe but
[46:47] right now if Brazil Cuts ties with
[46:49] United States we're in trouble so I
[46:53] don't think they have the incentives to
[46:55] do that and if they do the economies are
[46:58] going to get worse and the population
[47:00] going to get mad and going to go blame
[47:03] Bitcoin or gold or whatever decision
[47:05] they do so let's not talk about
[47:09] countries let's talk about companies so
[47:11] you're the CFO of Microsoft the company
[47:14] is doing well it's one of the more most
[47:17] profitable companies in the world one of
[47:19] the most valubles then you raise your
[47:21] hand and say well why don't we get 10%
[47:24] of the reserves and allocating to
[47:26] bitcoin
[47:27] you have no advantage of doing that
[47:30] because if that 10% doubles or triples
[47:33] in five year time it's not going to be a
[47:35] game Cher for the company
[47:38] right but if the United States in one
[47:42] year time says those companies that hope
[47:45] have Bitcoin are are banned to to to
[47:47] sell to the US governments or to our uh
[47:50] partners that we're gonna go cut ties
[47:53] with Microsoft if you don't sell Bitcoin
[47:55] so people are going to ask but who did
[47:58] not study that who was the person who
[48:00] took that decision and not saw the risk
[48:03] because we are not a finance Investment
[48:05] Company we're here to sell sofware or
[48:07] whatever we're not here to make money
[48:09] from our investments that's not our job
[48:11] so this person is going to be
[48:13] fired there there's not much gain to
[48:15] raise in the hand and say hey I think
[48:17] micros shops should invest 10 or 20 or
[48:20] 50% of our Holdings in Bitcoin that's
[48:22] not what the company was designed
[48:25] for and how how will this uh like how
[48:29] will this then work when when we have
[48:31] companies slow like we have Micro
[48:33] strategy we have even like Tesla but
[48:36] they are like founder that they are
[48:40] really like one person can make a
[48:42] decision almost like a dictator where IL
[48:45] musk is on top and he says like oh I
[48:48] want Bitcoin those companies are
[48:50] probably like the ones who who don't
[48:52] care
[48:53] about the government don't care say uh
[48:57] those will be like just the first step
[48:59] and and then when it comes to a certain
[49:01] point then the the more companies will
[49:03] come I think the two of them can happen
[49:06] SE separately the first one is the banks
[49:08] JP Morgan is going to tell well I want
[49:10] 10% of my reserves allocated in Bitcoin
[49:13] because I have to serve those kind of
[49:14] clients or those kind of companies that
[49:16] need need coin I'm I'm going to allocate
[49:18] 10% sorry United States I don't carry I
[49:21] don't care if you want to shut DP Morgan
[49:23] Gold sacks down you can try you won't be
[49:25] able to the government and the banks are
[49:28] they have their hands tied they like a
[49:30] one and so I think banks adopting
[49:34] Bitcoin maybe JP Morgan issuing his own
[49:37] uh stable coin that's partially b b
[49:40] backed by Bitcoin something something
[49:42] like that can happen and will happen and
[49:44] the other side is what I said about the
[49:47] middle guy the middle class guy who's
[49:50] going to be forced out of the system
[49:52] because of CD cbdc restrictions so I
[49:55] don't think they both need to happen at
[49:57] the same time but those are the biggest
[49:59] drivers for adoption when the banks
[50:02] start having the reserves in partial of
[50:05] the reserves in Bitcoin and when the
[50:07] middle class is cut of the financial
[50:09] system because of the
[50:12] cbdc or from
[50:15] government i l that actually a lot uh
[50:18] when when when we when we look at uh the
[50:21] Bitcoin adoption it's it it it's all the
[50:25] factors and all the players involved
[50:27] make it so that it's organic uh and it's
[50:30] it's it's not too fast to break anything
[50:33] uh but it it comes to the right people
[50:36] first when it when it makes sense like
[50:38] it's uh you I always make this example
[50:41] with the T the tanic when the Fiat uh
[50:44] system sinks
[50:47] slowly uh it you don't want the Titanic
[50:49] to syn too fast you want it to sink
[50:52] slowly so people can actually get on the
[50:55] live ref get actually get on bitcoin I
[50:58] mean uh I actually got to know that uh
[51:00] the tianic took four hours to sync which
[51:04] is uh for me fascinating be like you are
[51:07] on the on the uh ship and you see it
[51:10] four hours long sinking slowly slowly in
[51:13] it has to be a
[51:16] horrifying uh thing um do do you also
[51:19] see that the the feat system will always
[51:23] be around or is there a time in I don't
[51:26] know 500 years uh where we don't have
[51:29] feed I think at least like the the near
[51:32] future we have it but do do you envision
[51:34] a time where there there is just no no
[51:36] fiat currency and and government
[51:38] governments has to be more service based
[51:40] I think it's going to be the end of the
[51:42] Fiat they're just going to change from
[51:44] government issue to corporate issue
[51:47] you're going to Amazon is going to buy a
[51:48] country and people who live on the
[51:50] Amazon country H they only circulate
[51:53] with Amazon money apple is going to buy
[51:56] country for themselves and people who
[51:58] live there have their apple houses Apple
[52:00] watches Apple cars Apple everything
[52:03] Apple uh health insurance Apple schools
[52:07] and whatever so Bitcoin is going to be
[52:10] not going to be useful there bit Bitcoin
[52:12] is always going to be the money of the
[52:15] Free World of the people who opt out of
[52:18] that system and so I don't care I really
[52:21] want to live on a free world I I see the
[52:24] advantage of living on Apple or Amazon
[52:26] world but it's just going to change
[52:29] there's still going to be Fiat it's not
[52:31] issued by the government it's going to
[52:33] be issued by the companies wow I never
[52:36] heard
[52:37] that Apple I think the the companies are
[52:42] have much more strength uh uh to survive
[52:46] than uh countries especially when we
[52:51] move to a digital world because you can
[52:53] be an apple consumer and use apple
[52:55] services for everything health insurance
[52:58] School whatever if if you if you live in
[53:01] Brazil you don't need to live in United
[53:03] States for that Apple can uh uh create
[53:07] shops here and do everything around here
[53:09] most of the things nowadays are digital
[53:11] in 20 years time it's going to be even
[53:13] more worse the kids won't go to school
[53:16] they just going to sit on some crazy
[53:18] [ __ ] and watch the the the the the
[53:20] headset they're going to be taught using
[53:22] Apple headsets so they don't go to
[53:24] schools anymore in 10 20 years time so I
[53:27] think the future is going to be digital
[53:29] and some of the people will opt out of
[53:32] that system and use Bitcoin on the Free
[53:34] World so the but this is then all
[53:38] privately owned when when we have like
[53:41] only Apple countries Amazon countries
[53:44] and the Free World uh it's all kind of
[53:47] the Free World because I I mean I guess
[53:50] in the Apple World Apple probably has a
[53:53] monopoly on Force still so it's like
[53:55] kind of new form of state but it's
[53:58] privately owned uh interesting model I
[54:01] never never thought of that uh but but
[54:05] but but I love it a lot um maybe come
[54:08] let's come to to this for the end of the
[54:10] podcast let's come to to to the near
[54:12] term future uh do you have any crazy
[54:15] predictions for 2094 well for Latin
[54:19] America as I I said after the Mexican
[54:22] socialist president was elected I see
[54:25] Latin America going to the right side to
[54:28] socialis far and Far and far ahead
[54:32] there's no way back there's no turning
[54:33] back from
[54:35] that having said that there's a lot of
[54:38] people in Latin America that are getting
[54:40] angry with the government they're not no
[54:43] longer going to support the Left Right
[54:45] the center the the Liberals they they
[54:47] don't care for any of that they want to
[54:49] live their lives so I think in the near
[54:51] term some countries maybe like El
[54:54] salador will have the bright idea why
[54:57] don't we invite invite those people in
[55:01] give them a Visa they're Engineers
[55:03] they're doctors they know how to work
[55:05] their restaurant chefs or their whatever
[55:07] they're good working guys why don't we
[55:10] invite them here give them a 10-year tax
[55:13] break let them rebuild our country or
[55:16] growth our nation so I think in the near
[55:18] term there will be a lot of families and
[55:20] people moving to countries that are
[55:23] open-minded maybe that support Bitcoin
[55:26] or not but but I just understood that
[55:29] people should be more free to do their
[55:31] things instead of the government being
[55:32] their nanny so I think in the near term
[55:35] we're going to see maybe not the US is
[55:38] losing population to Europe or to Africa
[55:41] or to Asia or to whatever maybe regions
[55:44] within the United States Texas for
[55:46] instance going to say well now we're
[55:48] going to accept immigrants taxfree 10
[55:51] years if they build shops if they bring
[55:54] revenues to here if they create jobs Etc
[55:57] so I think for the next five years
[55:59] that's what's going to drive most people
[56:02] to bitcoin friendly places because when
[56:04] you move to some place like that he says
[56:07] he's taxfree for 10 years people who won
[56:10] a lot of money in Bitcoin who got rich
[56:12] over the the past 10 years they want to
[56:15] they don't want to pay tax to Europe or
[56:16] to United States so they're going to be
[56:18] moving to those regions and then you
[56:21] could see other cities well Texas is
[56:24] doing much fine than us there're GDP is
[56:26] growing 10% because of that we need to
[56:29] copy to copy that so I think that's
[56:31] going to be the main driver for the five
[56:33] the next five years and I'm not only
[56:35] talking about Bitcoin I'm talking about
[56:37] the mentality that we don't need to be
[56:39] government so controlled by governs we
[56:42] can have our own schools our own health
[56:44] system we can have private roads and we
[56:47] can go from
[56:49] there yeah also think that uh freedom is
[56:53] hopefully I see it maybe I'm dreaming
[56:56] too much but hopefully on the rise I I
[56:59] see uh the the the internet yeah it it
[57:03] goes a little bit worse before going on
[57:06] the rise I think we we still have a a
[57:09] step to to move moving to the Socialist
[57:12] side is is the cbdc one part of that
[57:16] yeah sure nothing huge part it's for me
[57:21] CBC is often also like um the the last
[57:24] straw of the the field
[57:26] system because it's like the the
[57:30] the the argue like oh we have to have
[57:33] better control of the of the US of the
[57:35] US dollar we have to have better control
[57:37] of the Fiat system we want that better
[57:39] that better and we have to compete with
[57:41] with in the new digital world even
[57:43] though all the Fe currencies are already
[57:45] kind of digital the I think how many
[57:48] percentages like 5% 10% 15% is Cash like
[57:51] actual physical cash and everything else
[57:53] is that's 2% 2% wow
[57:57] uh
[57:58] so what does it bring like it's it's
[58:01] it's just more control and a fancy new
[58:03] name but how long do you think this is
[58:06] going to last until people realize it
[58:09] was a trap will be interesting to see
[58:11] it's like no clue how how long people
[58:15] will will see hopefully not long
[58:18] but some some people are really
[58:22] ignorant it's not about ignorant my
[58:24] mother is PhD in economy from The
[58:27] massachusett Institute of whatever he
[58:29] studied in BOS she studied in Boston and
[58:32] she she seees some value in Gold would
[58:34] never invest in gold uh she in her mind
[58:39] if the governments crumble if the fat
[58:42] system crumbles then we're going to go
[58:45] back to the stone ages that's what's in
[58:47] her mind well if we don't have the
[58:49] countries to to to believe in then we
[58:52] have nothing to back us it's not worth
[58:55] having Bitcoin or go those are also
[58:57] going to be valed at zero that's what
[58:59] she thinks so I think it's a little bit
[59:01] of that slave mentality that we talked
[59:04] we need this new generation to come
[59:06] forward and to to to Really change stuff
[59:10] it's not going to be people who are in
[59:12] their 40s 50s 60s it's a minor part of
[59:16] those guys who were brought under the
[59:19] Fiat system that will be able to break
[59:21] free it's the minority it's Mo most on
[59:24] the hands of the new generation so I
[59:26] think it can take 15 years so we can
[59:30] have a
[59:32] Bitcoin as the the the biggest asset and
[59:36] as the most I'm not say day-to-day
[59:39] transactions but backing the day-to-day
[59:41] transactions that's what the banks own
[59:44] that's what the the the companies own
[59:46] they can circulate their apple dollars
[59:48] yes but they're backed by Bitcoin
[59:51] they're backed by Lands they're backed
[59:53] by the the co the go the the revenue of
[59:57] the company or whatever but not by Fiat
[59:59] anymore it's going to take some 15
[60:01] years I love it a lot um when we talk
[60:06] about uh those bigger micro Trends uh
[60:10] the the one question that like people
[60:12] always ask me like where's the price
[60:15] going like one year two years and and
[60:17] I'm always like I'm I'm really not that
[60:19] interested the price I'm sorry to say uh
[60:23] but new newbies are just like really
[60:25] interesting in in the price and I also
[60:28] see it with with YouTube and I put price
[60:30] things and I I think only did l in few
[60:33] videos because I'm really not interested
[60:34] in it but they tend to have a higher
[60:37] click through it people like oh price oh
[60:40] let's let's see that video where there's
[60:41] some price action going yeah yeah go go
[60:44] ahead we
[60:46] all we
[60:49] shouldn't lie to our public to our
[60:52] viewers 90% of people I know that are
[60:55] hard or bitcoiners today they entered
[60:58] because of grid I don't I I don't think
[61:01] that's a bad thing I think grid is part
[61:04] of the human nature is not something
[61:07] inherently
[61:08] negative uh but once you get into
[61:11] Bitcoin and you study that for I don't
[61:14] know six month a year you realize it's
[61:17] not about price it's depends on what
[61:21] stage of the cycle of the adopt cycle
[61:24] I'm not saying the fouryear cycle of the
[61:26] adoption cycle we are as a society as a
[61:29] whole because the Fiat is a scam it's
[61:32] clearly a scam I don't know if it's
[61:34] going to last for another five years or
[61:36] for another 20 years but it's going to
[61:38] break eventually are going to people go
[61:41] back to the gold standard they're going
[61:43] to be using gold and silver coins I have
[61:45] no idea I don't think that people who
[61:47] are 20 years old 30 years old 15 years
[61:49] old are going to be using [ __ ] gold
[61:51] coins in 15 years so there's got to be
[61:54] another way so I think that a lot of
[61:58] bitcoiners say that Teter and USD coin
[62:01] stable coins are the the the gateway
[62:04] drugs for crypto and for Bitcoin and I
[62:07] don't I don't think that's true if you
[62:10] transactions in US dollar whether it's
[62:12] St usdc coin or JP Morgan Bank account
[62:16] you're a believer of the Fiat system you
[62:18] trust them so I don't see how that it's
[62:22] even related to crypto I don't think it
[62:25] should be even go on coin gcko and coin
[62:27] market cap because though are those are
[62:29] completely different things it can it
[62:32] can be seized by the government it can
[62:34] be seized by the administ it can be
[62:37] seized by T Company by Circle company at
[62:39] any time and you cannot do anything
[62:41] against that so there's nothing crypto
[62:44] in that I can discuss e we we could
[62:48] spend hours discussing if ethereum is
[62:50] crypto or if it's better or worse than
[62:53] Bitcoin at least it's a crypto at least
[62:56] it's somehow
[62:57] decentralized uh but when we're talking
[62:59] about Teter and usdc coin there's no way
[63:02] to defend that it's it's Fiat money in
[63:06] another different color of Bank notes so
[63:09] I don't think that maybe ethereum is a
[63:11] Petway to bitcoin you start in ethereum
[63:14] you spend five where five you go to the
[63:16] defi e you get some Rook Poes you lose
[63:19] money there they change the the policy
[63:22] the monetary policy to be ultrasound and
[63:24] then you say well
[63:26] that's not what I sign up for I wanted
[63:29] decentralized I I I wanted my nodes to
[63:31] be able to say if the rules can change
[63:34] the inflation change or not and that's
[63:36] not what happening here so I think
[63:38] ethereum is a gateway D to bitcoin but
[63:40] not sa
[63:43] coins I love the sign ethereum is a
[63:45] gateway track to to
[63:48] bitcoin I see also the the stable coins
[63:51] it's really why are they in all the coin
[63:53] market caps and and and the
[63:56] because also there's
[63:58] a market dominance ratio always like how
[64:02] much market dominance has Bitcoin and I
[64:05] like to look at the market dominance
[64:06] ratio with excluded the the the stable
[64:11] coins because they're not even into the
[64:13] calculation you can make an argument
[64:15] that ethereum is in the calculation all
[64:17] the altcoins are in the calculation but
[64:21] why are we caling part of the field
[64:24] system into the in the calculation it
[64:27] just doesn't make sense if you want to
[64:29] calculate against the Fiat system yes
[64:31] this this makes sense it's a small
[64:32] percentage where Bitcoin has a dominance
[64:34] it's like I don't know what percentage
[64:37] the Bitcoin has against all the the fear
[64:39] it's a really small one but uh it just
[64:41] doesn't make sense to to mix those those
[64:43] things up yeah yeah and if you think it
[64:45] true for example Dodge Coin there's no
[64:49] way a Bitcoin Maxi can argue saying oh
[64:53] this is a scam this is not a
[64:55] cryptocurrency
[64:56] their monetary policy is invalid it's
[64:58] impossible because it's
[65:01] 99.5% the the code is based on Litecoin
[65:05] which was based on bitcoin so it's the
[65:07] same code they have a a large number of
[65:11] miners so we can
[65:14] discuss if there's a future for Dogecoin
[65:17] or not we can discuss why it hasn't been
[65:19] updated the code in the past seven years
[65:21] Etc so I think it's worthless but no
[65:25] bitcoiner can say that it shouldn't
[65:27] exist or it's a gambo it's risky it's
[65:30] just a token like Sheba whatever no it's
[65:33] a
[65:33] cryptocurrency it may has value it may
[65:36] be only a test night like Litecoin used
[65:39] to be for Bitcoin uh but it exists
[65:43] there's miners working on that there's
[65:44] proof of work like on tokens there's
[65:47] nothing to be discussed there m it's
[65:50] like you're buying a a t-shirt that has
[65:53] been autographed by the player that you
[65:55] like that's what you're buying you're
[65:57] buying a collectible there there's no
[65:59] real value in it there's no way to for
[66:01] you to personally check the database
[66:03] because you depend on ethereum you
[66:05] depend on arbitrum you depend on polygon
[66:08] there are hundreds of other things
[66:10] points of failur that you cannot control
[66:13] so those those are not cryptocurrencies
[66:16] so I think we should exclude from coin
[66:18] market cap on K the stable coins and The
[66:21] Tokens The Tokens are a completely
[66:22] different thing they don't have their
[66:23] own blockchain they don't have their own
[66:25] miners it's not a
[66:27] cryptocurrency this makes a lot of sense
[66:30] and
[66:31] I'm I was one and a half years two years
[66:34] ago I was really against all the
[66:37] altcoins and I'm still am but the thing
[66:40] that changed for me uh is that I I don't
[66:45] hate against them anymore I'm just
[66:48] seeing them as one petition in the in
[66:50] the market uh and I just don't speak
[66:54] about them because I have no interest in
[66:56] them uh and if if a good friend of mine
[66:59] ask me if I should if he should invest
[67:01] in that and that I always answer like do
[67:03] your own research I would not do it but
[67:05] do your own research uh and I'm more way
[67:09] more libertarian than than back then
[67:11] because I'm like if those truly don't
[67:14] have any value they will go to zero at
[67:17] some point in time because the free
[67:19] market uh is is is rational over over
[67:22] the long run but Robin think think about
[67:26] uh development if we did not have the
[67:29] evm the ethereum virtual machine to
[67:32] build everything from scratch on bitcoin
[67:34] the bit VM or whatever is coming here it
[67:37] would take much longer since we have
[67:40] this open test net with mood pole shoe
[67:43] and whatever they are using or or
[67:46] federations or I don't know what they
[67:48] use exactly but we can take some of that
[67:51] that we see well the ZK stuff they're
[67:54] doing let's imp that on bitcoin the evm
[67:57] is doing good so let's Implement that on
[67:59] bitcoin so I think it as a test net and
[68:02] test net should be worth something
[68:05] otherwise nobody will develop on that
[68:07] nobody will try to hack it so I I see
[68:10] the altcoins especially ethereum
[68:11] ecosystem as a test net for what you can
[68:14] do in Bitcoin Maybe not today but in
[68:16] twoe
[68:17] time uh lot a few on a few on on Al
[68:21] coins um slowly we get into the end
[68:24] routine as we come to the end of the
[68:26] time already um what are you currently
[68:30] passionate about besides Bitcoin like
[68:32] what what are you doing uh or learning
[68:34] about or doing as activity or whatever
[68:38] uh what you're passionate about besides
[68:40] uh
[68:41] Bitcoin well I have two kids a girl 8y
[68:44] old a boy two year old and uh every time
[68:48] I think about the traditional education
[68:51] that I had as a upper middle class in
[68:54] Brazil I think of uh how much
[68:59] we I don't know I'm not going to sell
[69:02] the I'm not going to say that the time
[69:03] was lost but was not used at the the the
[69:06] the maximum it could be to develop the
[69:09] kids to develop kids like me 30 years
[69:12] ago so I'm always trying to to study and
[69:16] to learn my my wife is a psychiatrist so
[69:19] sometime we discuss things like that how
[69:22] can how can we help kids to develop
[69:26] their full potential without trying to
[69:28] be so much like father and mother and
[69:30] school yeah you have to do this you have
[69:32] to that way you have to learn math that
[69:35] way so I'm always interested on how we
[69:38] can uh uh make those kids go to the
[69:42] higher of their reputation without being
[69:44] like the pain in the ass that's telling
[69:46] them no you need to go to to school no
[69:48] you need to learn learn how to play
[69:50] tennis or another sport you need how to
[69:52] do that I think I I'm always interested
[69:55] on how we can uh uh make kids accelerate
[69:58] their growth and their learning curve
[70:01] I'm always interested in that so I I
[70:02] read a lot of psychology or positive
[70:06] psychology and Psychiatry books and
[70:08] stuff like that love it for me to be a
[70:10] better f a better fighter basically it's
[70:14] it's uh I guess the the most important
[70:17] job you you can do right
[70:21] now I love it a lot um we have an endro
[70:24] in the podcast where the previous guest
[70:26] is asking a question for the next guest
[70:28] uh without knowing who actually the next
[70:30] guest is it's always an interesting form
[70:32] because uh this the one question add on
[70:35] control and it's one question uh that is
[70:38] not suited to the guest uh but it's
[70:41] always something uh funny coming up or
[70:43] funny or interesting or something new
[70:45] coming out um and the question for you
[70:47] is how do we get more wom in Bitcoin
[70:50] side note on this question uh it did not
[70:53] came from a woman
[70:56] okay I need I think we need an example
[70:59] some someone young like the Taylor Swift
[71:02] girl that girls love and have a deep
[71:06] connection with her and once she doesn't
[71:09] need to be a Bitcoin Maxi anything like
[71:12] that but once she tells her audience
[71:15] well I'm investing 5% of my fortune in
[71:18] Bitcoin I'm time locking that [ __ ] for
[71:20] 20 years I don't need that money if it
[71:23] goes to zero it goes but it's going to
[71:26] be for my kids in 20 year time because I
[71:29] don't know if my managers my Banks and
[71:32] my husband whever will be able to to
[71:34] take care of them but I know that being
[71:37] time locked for 20 years and only they
[71:39] they have the the code to the access of
[71:42] the to the bank where the seed is
[71:43] written that's going to be my
[71:45] inheritance to them so I think that's
[71:47] going to trigger on the other woman
[71:50] around the world especially the younger
[71:52] generation H maybe I should be doing
[71:55] some something like that for myself I
[71:57] don't be want to be dependent on the
[71:59] banks on my husband or my fathers or
[72:02] whatever I want to be able to provide
[72:04] for my kids in 20 year time so I'm going
[72:06] to start doing this tress fund with time
[72:09] locked I even I won't have access if
[72:11] somebody comes with a gun on my head
[72:14] sorry I cannot it's time locked it's
[72:15] going to take 20 years so I think when
[72:18] some people like Taylor Swift move to
[72:20] that side doesn't need to be a Bitcoin
[72:23] Maxi but it's going to be open the B for
[72:25] more women to adopt they need an
[72:29] example very very true I love the answer
[72:32] um we're coming to the end end of the
[72:35] podcast uh before I let you go uh where
[72:37] can people find you where can people uh
[72:39] read stuff about you where can people
[72:41] ask you
