[00:00] anytime we've ever bought it we always think 
oh I should have bought it you know everyone  
[00:03] has that same mindset and we're still only 
at 1% adoption so people have to get over  
[00:08] that idea that they're too late to it so they 
have to stop ignoring it all they remember was  
[00:12] Bitcoin crashed I think it's stuck in people's 
minds what happened with FTX that exchange was  
[00:17] in trouble bitcoin's never been in trouble but 
if you think about that they promoted the heck  
[00:21] out of that so everybody thinks FTX Bitcoin bad 
scary you know so it's like people don't even  
[00:27] really realize that the price has surpassed 
as previous alltime highs I really feel like  
[00:32] the 2020 cycle was cut short you know it 
was attacked and I do think that because  
[00:37] the people that attacked it or cut it short or 
manipulated markets in order to kind of bring  
[00:43] this economic shift to kind of slow things down 
until they were involved now they are involved  
[00:48] so now things can like they can like Let It 
Rip like ky's Kyra reward but you could also  
[00:52] lose it all I don't gamble like I just hold 
Bitcoin I'm like I'm I'm not going to mess  
[00:55] around with that stuff I feel like we're just 
at the very beginning of something monumental
[01:05] you proposed something interesting to talk about 
GameStop I saw the picture from Michael sailor  
[01:10] and how's the guy called Ryan Cohan or something 
like that yeah um which was like oh like I when  
[01:17] Gamestop first came on the scene I was like they 
have to now utilize that capital and buy as much  
[01:23] Bitcoin as they possibly can it would be an 
amazing strategy if they would have done it  
[01:28] uh do you kind of predict that this will happen no 
well yeah especially after seeing that post that  
[01:33] was really exciting um it's just something kind of 
we've all had in the back of our heads like they  
[01:37] should do it that's um it's just a perfect fit 
Michael sailor says how he got into it when he  
[01:43] was at the point in his life where he was ready to 
retire or try Bitcoin you know because he really  
[01:49] didn't have any options left for his company 
and people have looked at GameStop for so long  
[01:53] trying to short the stock you know thinking 
it's uh you know on its way out and uh this  
[01:59] is the perfect opportunity to do what micro 
strategy did um to bring you know that uh life  
[02:05] back to the company and uh preserve its cash and 
not let it uh you know just get run out you know  
[02:12] just uh it'll be it'll be really interesting it's 
a really good play for them but uh living through  
[02:17] that I was just thinking about it when I told you 
that I would like to talk about it because um I  
[02:22] don't know if you remember like did you ever see 
that movie that they made about it about GameStop  
[02:27] no actually I didn't it was a it was a pretty 
interesting movie but it was like we lived through  
[02:32] that you know we lived through you know the last 
Bull Run we lived through Bitcoin hitting its  
[02:37] alltime high and at around that same time was when 
this GameStop stuff was playing out and I remember  
[02:43] seeing it all and hearing about it but I was in 
Bitcoin I wasn't worried about GameStop or I just  
[02:48] thought it was funny because they were showing you 
know the majority of the people they were showing  
[02:54] people how Wall Street works and how they're 
actually you know turning the game around ground  
[03:00] on them so it was really fun to see and um just 
to see what kind of uh you know scammers kind of  
[03:06] there are on Wall Street and just exposing that um 
is that the dumb money movie from yes interesting  
[03:14] that they Diamond hands and like game kind of 
like that whole thing when we were like into  
[03:19] like when I first got into it I was in 2020 and 
I started seeing the whole Diamond hands you know  
[03:23] hotle thing but it was it was a lot of this talk 
was from Reddit people and you know uh GameStop  
[03:30] um M like chaos that was going on at the time 
and all the shorting of the stock that was  
[03:34] happening and billionaires losing money it was 
actually really fun to see that uh they really  
[03:38] did a good job with the movie but seeing this 
happening now with Michael sailor and the CEO  
[03:45] of GameStop meeting is just it feels like we're 
going to be living through part two of that movie  
[03:51] like they're just going to be like now it's 
not just GameStop you know and that roaring  
[03:55] Kitty hyping people up and shorting the stock 
and you know making billionaires lose a lot of  
[04:01] money on shorting it but um what it is is it's 
now it's going to be with Bitcoin so it's going  
[04:09] to be interesting if they put their uh reserves 
into Bitcoin and there's people still trying to  
[04:14] short the stock they're really going to get get 
a um a roote Awakening so I just think it's gonna  
[04:21] be interesting we're gonna be living through 
that it's also interesting when you think about  
[04:25] that uh narrative that GameStop is kind of like 
against the uh big traditional financer Elite uh  
[04:34] that narrative I think could resonate a lot with 
bitcoiners and if they get a nice story around the  
[04:41] stock I think there are many wealthy bitcoiners 
who just buy the stock just because to to to be  
[04:49] part of that part two of the GameStop story true 
yeah it's almost like how people that are you know  
[04:55] when they understand that a company is like mic 
strategy there's a lot of bitcoiners that are  
[05:01] they love micro strategy I I love micro strategy I 
think uh sailor is uh a huge advocate for Bitcoin  
[05:07] and I think what he's doing is bringing Bitcoin 
to Wall Street and mainstream and institutions  
[05:12] and I think what he's doing is a huge part of 
uh bringing it to mainstream adoption but people  
[05:18] like micro strategy for that reason so I feel 
they would do the same with GameStop they would  
[05:23] embrace it fully because it's uh then a Bitcoin 
company you know so it wouldn't just be G we  
[05:29] we'd be rooting for it to come up with new ideas 
and stick around for the Long Haul absolutely that  
[05:36] would be really cool and uh saor talked about 
that on my podcast actually where he talked  
[05:42] about if you want to make your company Immortal uh 
adopt Bitcoin and buy as many Bitcoin as you want  
[05:49] because that could that could actually prolong 
and extend your life because GameStop the core  
[05:55] business model is kind of running out if they find 
a way of making the brand cool again and make like  
[06:03] hangout places with those GameStop things uh 
that could be a major hit like they they could  
[06:11] just be uh from that one lucky instance of like 
someone picking GameStop up in the stock making  
[06:18] that narrative uh could make a lot of uh wealth 
around that a lot of a great narrative also for  
[06:26] the Bitcoin Community could be could be exciting 
let see what Ryan is up to yeah I think it's just  
[06:32] it's going to be interesting because people will 
get into it not knowing that they're getting into  
[06:38] a company that's getting involved with Bitcoin but 
they just want to get in on the hype and they just  
[06:43] you know people that don't know about Bitcoin will 
just get in on it for that reason and they'll be  
[06:48] doing well because of it you know because Bitcoin 
does help your company preserve its its life it's  
[06:53] uh it's longevity you know you won't go extinct 
so um and I heard some interesting things too  
[06:59] something my husband told me was that um they're 
going to be getting into something I forgot what  
[07:04] it's called something about trading cards or you 
know B basketball cards people that collect that  
[07:09] stuff they're going to be doing something now 
where they grade the cards like they're getting  
[07:14] into that type of things so there's like different 
things they'll probably come out with that we have  
[07:18] no idea that GameStop would even care about or 
do so who knows what it could what could happen  
[07:24] absolutely and especially if you have a whole 
internet culture around it and people are rooting  
[07:29] for you they they come up with ideas and support 
you while you're executing it uh that could make  
[07:35] that could bring a stock in the company in its 
own life and uh completely convert the business  
[07:41] model to something really great um but it's it's 
it's definitely interesting what what's kind of  
[07:47] happening this year what what do you make out of 
this year so far uh you you told me you're already  
[07:53] some years in in in the in the space and you have 
been around the block um what are you making of of  
[07:59] this year yeah I just feel like I feel like we're 
just at the very beginning of something Monumental  
[08:06] I think that uh since I began this journey again 
I've been through uh covid I started with covid  
[08:16] for the most part um but I learned a lot about 
monetary policy and fed tightening and all those  
[08:23] you know types of uh policies that the FED is 
involved with so um I feel like it's time now  
[08:29] that we've had a hard enough last couple years of 
high interest rates and tightening policy that now  
[08:34] we're in this Zone where it is going to uh change 
because it's just time for it and not to mention  
[08:42] also you know with President Trump now being pro 
crypto and all these uh you know lowering interest  
[08:48] rates and the econom is about to shift you know 
for many different reasons but I think the FED has  
[08:52] a lot to do with and it's just time it's like it's 
been you know a long time coming but I think it's  
[08:57] uh we've had enough pain to now to start to turn 
things around and um you know see this huge shift  
[09:04] that's about to happen but I was uh I tweeted 
the other day I thought it was I like to look  
[09:10] at charts you know I don't trade Bitcoin but I I 
love to just study every day for the last couple  
[09:15] years I'm just watching and just trying to predict 
which is impossible but uh in a way you can kind  
[09:21] of see what what the Market's doing and I thought 
the last few days were interesting watching the  
[09:25] Bitcoin price because it just looked spooky to me 
it's like seeing it at a standstill like it looked  
[09:30] like it was like the low points in the price were 
just the last five days or so or even six I think  
[09:35] there was one bigger candle day but it was a huge 
chunk almost a week worth of time where the price  
[09:41] was just bottoming out at the same Zone and it was 
just weird to me I thought that doesn't mean it's  
[09:48] a bad thing that means that there's not enough 
selling pressure to bring it lower um and I just  
[09:56] think that it's a calm before the storm um so 
it's just it's just really interesting how it  
[10:04] still retail like regular people aren't in the 
space uh too much yet you don't hear about it  
[10:11] you know I think that in 2020 a lot of people were 
starting to talk about it and institutions weren't  
[10:19] yet involved but this is a whole different thing 
that's happening now because the retail knows  
[10:26] nothing about it yet they don't even realize that 
all they remember was Bitcoin crashed I think it's  
[10:31] stuck in people's minds what happened with FTX 
and I think that's on purpose I think they wanted  
[10:40] to promote FTX and all the fear and all the scary 
things that happened when that exchange went down  
[10:45] so and then in my line of work I'm a hairdresser 
I work at um you know my small business and when  
[10:52] I talk to people about Bitcoin they just think 
oh yeah that's uh that FTX that's Bitcoin they  
[10:58] just associated it with bit they think that's what 
Bitcoin is and Bitcoin was in trouble I'm like no  
[11:03] that's totally not the same thing you know that's 
just uh like how you have a stock market you have  
[11:07] an exchange that exchange was in trouble bitcoin's 
never been in trouble but if you think about that  
[11:12] they promoted the heck out of that so everybody 
thinks FTX Bitcoin bad scary you know so it's like  
[11:21] people don't even really realize that the price 
has surpassed its previous all-time highs nobody's  
[11:26] paying attention and uh I think this time around 
it's because the institutions are involved wall  
[11:31] Street's involved um you know uh nation states 
are getting in you know buying Bitcoin and get  
[11:39] uh adding it to their treasury reserve and it's 
like if if it's talked about too much amongst uh  
[11:47] regular people then the price would get away from 
them before they had enough time to accumulate  
[11:53] what they wanted so I think it's on purpose that 
it's not being talked about it's this weird quiet  
[11:58] time right now like it was actually the first year 
surprisingly for me when I watched the Super Bowl  
[12:03] since I learned about Bitcoin every year since 
I learned about Bitcoin I thought when the Super  
[12:08] Bowl came around I thought oh how many Bitcoin 
commercials are there going to be I wonder this  
[12:12] was the first year that I didn't expect any and 
I didn't see any you know I just I really didn't  
[12:19] even have the thought in my head that I would see 
any and that's just kind of funny because I think  
[12:24] I know in the back of my mind that they're not 
trying to promote it you know the people that  
[12:29] want to be the wealthiest and hold the most you 
know power in the world or the companies that  
[12:35] want to do the best and survive I think that it do 
they don't want to let everyone know that this is  
[12:42] what you should do so I just think it's like 
eily quiet right now because everyone's just  
[12:46] trying to like it's almost like they're walking in 
a Minefield it's like in my mind I just think like  
[12:50] everyone's trying to collect like slow enough 
where they can um you know collect Bitcoin but  
[12:57] also they're shorting at the same time I think 
a lot of the selling pressure now is not real I  
[13:02] think people that are bears are really bulls 
and they're just trying to short markets to  
[13:06] collect more so I just think it's like this like 
little game that they're playing to to collect and  
[13:11] that's what it seems like it just seems like this 
weird like everyone's being tactical or strategic  
[13:16] if you will about how they're accumulating it's 
it's super interesting there was a lot in there  
[13:23] like the the thing was with uh the Super Bowl I 
think was mostly on bitcoin and crypto focused I  
[13:32] think 2022 was the year where like FDX had a huge 
ad in there and I think FX was not even yeah coin  
[13:42] like the QR code oh yeah they had the Cod that 
was bouncing around and then there the side was I  
[13:48] think down for some some some some minutes because 
they couldn't handle the load I remember something  
[13:55] like that so that's that's super interesting uh 
but yeah like this year was I didn't even uh this  
[14:01] year the Super Bowl was weird I think like one day 
later I was like oh the Super Bowl was I think now  
[14:07] it was last Sunday and now it's already Tuesday 
evening so I was like oh oh the super bow was yeah  
[14:15] but maybe that's because I'm not American it's 
also also interesting this this 100K I showed it  
[14:23] before I can show it show it show it again because 
um it's that price chart is super interesting for  
[14:31] me uh before we even hit the 100K uh till now 
it's basically in the same range of like going  
[14:39] from like 90 3K to like 105 or something like 
that so like it's it's always like uh in in  
[14:45] that same range as you say like the karma before 
the storm uh and like in the past uh few days and  
[14:51] weeks it's very very very uh stable um and for 
me it was a big surprise that the 100K was not  
[15:01] a big catalyze it it was basically just briefly 
in all the news articles of like oh like Bitcoin  
[15:08] hit the 100K uh because of Donald Trump uh that 
that's the sole reason why Bitcoin hits 100K and  
[15:16] that's it and there was nothing else and it was 
really interesting to see that also nobody really  
[15:21] cared in the norm world like we celebrated Bitcoin 
has celebrated there were 100K parties all over  
[15:26] the place but normally is didn't care at all that 
Bitcoin hit 100K and then I was like you probably  
[15:33] know Bitcoin since like 5K and you don't care 
about it that it's hit 100K like you're paying  
[15:40] no attention at all and I think the people that 
don't care even if they do hear about it they're  
[15:44] like all they think is oh well I missed out you 
know not realizing that we're just only at the  
[15:51] 1% of global adoption and we have a long way to go 
like this is not but all people think is it's 100k  
[15:59] should have bought it when it was this but that's 
what everyone thinks again anytime we've ever  
[16:03] bought it we always think oh I should have bought 
it you know everyone has that same mindset and  
[16:07] we're still only at 1% adoption so people have to 
get over that idea that it's that they're they're  
[16:13] too late to it so they have to stop ignoring it 
you know it's it's something that will continue  
[16:18] to go up it's not at a peak right now and I have 
people who know that I've been in Bitcoin for a  
[16:22] few years and it's I just I I've learned to engage 
less with the people that are um um I would say  
[16:30] toxic because uh you know there's some people that 
have such a big ego that you'll just never really  
[16:36] like they won't get it until something clicks for 
them one day I don't know what it will be but I  
[16:42] had a client come into the salon and he's like 
oh you're still holding Bitcoin I'm like yeah  
[16:47] and he's like you should take a take a put or like 
buy a put and I'm like okay and he's like I'm like  
[16:53] why would I do that he goes you got to protect 
your downside in case Bitcoin hits 60k again  
[16:59] cuz that was when it hit 100K and he's like you 
got to protect your downside I'm like and there's  
[17:03] no risk when you do this right I knew I wasn't 
going to do it but I just wanted to you know just  
[17:07] see what his response was and he's like oh yeah 
whatever money you put in it you know he's like  
[17:13] you just lose that money if it goes up instead 
I'm like so there so you're just gambling now at  
[17:18] this point and I don't gamble I'm like I just hold 
Bitcoin I'm like I'm I'm not going to mess around  
[17:22] with that stuff he just people think they're so 
smart that it'll just drop they think this is  
[17:26] some kind of peak and it's not you know it's not 
a peak it's just right now it's it's just crazy  
[17:33] how we see it and we know that hitting 100K for us 
would have been into that price Discovery you know  
[17:41] that area where it just keeps going but that's 
why I think because of all this money that's  
[17:46] in the space right now I feel like they're playing 
like this little tiptoe you know walking through a  
[17:52] Minefield like they're trying to collect as much 
as they can while also shorting it you know to  
[17:58] make money shorting it while they keep collecting 
so I feel like it's just kind of like this you  
[18:02] know little and at one point it's going to just 
catch so many people off sides and it's gonna take  
[18:08] off and um people will have to stop playing these 
little games because um it's just like eventually  
[18:16] it's going to happen you know it's going to just 
keep going and and catch people so absolutely and  
[18:22] and uh just just for the few people that might not 
know uh like uh call and put options are basically  
[18:27] like you you can buy options on that that 
expire on one day then you can uh get exposure  
[18:33] to downside of a stock and upside to a stock uh I 
I will not think we don't need to go into details  
[18:42] but like call options is like if you uh uh bet on 
the upside and you can get some leverage on that  
[18:48] and put options if you bet on the downside uh and 
that's how you can make money uh even if something  
[18:56] goes down without selling it uh which is an 
interesting play if you're very longterm in in in  
[19:03] Bitcoin or a stock or something like that uh but 
in the end of the day it's it's speculation and I  
[19:09] I was investigating those strategies a little bit 
when I was uh let's say a stock boy before Bitcoin  
[19:18] uh and uh even back then being fully immerged init 
in the field system I didn't really like it and I  
[19:24] never used it uh but uh it is it is something uh 
worth investigating a little bit uh but I would  
[19:33] never put my money in there it's just something 
I think like general knowledge you should have  
[19:37] an idea about but you don't need to yeah engage 
with it I think I think those are just like the  
[19:44] high risk you know type trades like highrisk high 
reward but you could also lose it all so it's like  
[19:50] you know I don't play around with that I partnered 
up with coin vigilante this is the most beautiful  
[19:58] Bitcoin time piece that I ever saw created by 
anyone look at that beauty I love it so much coin

it's super interesting how the general population  
[22:07] looks at uh Bitcoin I I've experienced that as 
the the people closer to me are more invested and  
[22:15] highly engaged in in in Bitcoin and the further 
down it goes the more czy the Bitcoin theories  
[22:21] get uh when I when I then meet them at like a 
Christmas table or something like that or like  
[22:27] Easter Easter is is is coming up uh and uh this 
time I heard a lot of like oh like it reached the  
[22:34] top now it will go down only now because like 
if it's if something reaches that high it only  
[22:40] can go down of course uh and then like it it uses 
too much energy it's inefficient something better  
[22:46] will come along like all those things I hear and 
I'm like just listening and I'm like okay perfect  
[22:54] why and then I I don't even discuss I just want 
to understand their uh standpoint and usually  
[23:03] what happens is after two questions um they all of 
the sudden are like oh [ __ ] like I'm running out  
[23:09] of arguments and then they start asking Bitcoin 
questions it's really inter that that's a really  
[23:15] interesting strategy if you want to uh encount 
if you encounter someone that has some arguments  
[23:22] against Bitcoin just uh be very curious of like 
why and and and ask and ask and ask because you  
[23:30] will encounter at some point a knowledge Gap uh 
and uh then they usually uh either go full rage  
[23:38] I love this or or if they are uh intelligent and 
open-minded and like luckily most of them in my  
[23:46] family actually are they ask questions like oh 
like okay why is why is that with Bitcoin oh  
[23:51] how does this work actually with Bitcoin and then 
you all of the sudden you're like H talking about  
[23:55] Bitcoin and how Bitcoin works and then they're 
getting a little bit orange build and you started  
[24:00] with a negative tone and you ended with a positive 
tone so that's amazing that's genius you should  
[24:06] like share that I'm gonna share that if you don't 
share it I will you you can you can share it uh I  
[24:14] I I didn't share it actually a lot but it's it's 
my it's always my strategy I even before Bitcoin I  
[24:22] when I encountered someone that uh was disagreeing 
with something that I did uh I was like okay the  
[24:30] best case I can do is figuring out why and how 
he thinks like that uh because there's either two  
[24:38] things happening the the one thing is happening I 
uh I I let him discover that he has uh not enough  
[24:46] arguments or the other thing happens um I might 
change my mind and I might learn something new  
[24:52] I expand my Horizon so anytime someone disagrees 
with me um I usually go in uh interviewing mode  
[25:02] well that's what's smart about it because now 
you're being uh you're being you're coming at  
[25:08] it from a place with no ego too because you're 
saying if I learn something then then I realized  
[25:15] I was wrong about something you know maybe you 
do have a point maybe I I want to learn like none  
[25:18] of us want to be in this space to be ignorant to 
the fact that there's nothing better than Bitcoin  
[25:23] that's it don't ever change my mind but we've 
done enough research that try to convince me  
[25:28] like try to tell me like as far as like it does 
it shows like you said like the knowledge Gap  
[25:35] somewhere like you keep asking the questions to 
their argument and you find who has who has the  
[25:42] Gap you know it's not because you're trying 
to prove yourself you just really want to be  
[25:46] curious like do you know something I don't know 
you know but then you it just it solves itself  
[25:52] it's like a self-correcting you know argument you 
know way of uh way of uh talking to somebody it's  
[25:58] amazing I love it and uh another great aspect is 
of like if you get your ego out and you are being  
[26:07] kind um in 97% of the cases the other person 
also lets their ego down and is kind in lets  
[26:15] their guard rails down um there are obviously 
Psychopaths and [ __ ] and and and people that  
[26:23] just like have now I show him uh observing that 
behavior then you're just almost like like it's  
[26:31] almost like you're still curious like watching a 
like a nature Channel like it's just you're just  
[26:36] interested like why are you oh look how you're 
behaving look how you're overreacting for for  
[26:41] no reason and and I do think uh coming back to 
bitcoin I do think that's very important that  
[26:47] we bitcoiners do that because I think Bitcoin is 
very innovat like Bitcoin is coming anyways uh but  
[26:54] there are two ways to this have a Bitcoin as world 
the one way is where uh where we basically have a  
[27:02] very peaceful Revolution and and everything 
is going smooth and every everyone is slowly  
[27:07] coming on board the other one is Civil War H and 
I think if we bitcoiners are are very loving and  
[27:14] kind and respectful and giving people time to 
learn the strategies and to learn Bitcoin and  
[27:20] um just being there as Educators uh the more we 
do that the higher the chance is to not have the  
[27:28] Civil War uh route and I'm curious how you see it 
with like how we get to that Bitcoin standard how  
[27:35] how we uh how we can improve our chances of doing 
a peaceful Revolution I think that um I think that  
[27:45] I don't know where I heard this I don't know if it 
was a sailor thing but it I I remember it all the  
[27:51] time about how most when we reach Global adoption 
it's going to come at a time where the majority of  
[27:58] the population doesn't even know that they're 
using it so it's going to happen whether they know  
[28:03] it or not like let's say for now that these ETFs 
exist and now that these companies are able to  
[28:12] hold uh a percentage of people's 401ks let's say 
in Bitcoin these people will not even they could  
[28:18] be arguing against Bitcoin saying they don't like 
it meanwhile they're management company is putting  
[28:24] a 1% allocation into Bitcoin and they're thinking 
I'm doing great for retirement and they don't even  
[28:28] know why uh or um you know using it like every day 
people use their credit card they don't understand  
[28:36] the systems behind using their credit card they 
just swipe it and pay their bill later they don't  
[28:41] know everything happening in the background the 
settlement systems the different people involved  
[28:46] you know the percentage like nobody knows what 
goes on there's a lot of stuff happening in the  
[28:50] background so with Bitcoin even though they don't 
fully understand it once it becomes more of like a  
[28:56] base layer for a new Financial system they'll be 
using it without even understanding that they're  
[29:02] doing it cuz even when you think about people now 
are so accustomed to QR codes I feel like that's  
[29:10] getting people used to bitcoin and used to this 
new Financial system without them understanding  
[29:17] that they're even doing it because that's how you 
transact wallet to wallet and now everywhere you  
[29:22] go there's a QR code and my kids Elementary School 
they have a poster outside scan the QR code every  
[29:28] thing is QR so you know older people have to learn 
how to use it everybody it's like they're just  
[29:34] slowly introducing these new ways to interact 
with the world that you have to you don't have  
[29:41] a choice you have to do it um and then that's 
when we're going to reach Global adoption it'll  
[29:47] happen without even anyone understanding that 
it's happening that's where I think people get  
[29:53] that gradually and then suddenly idea because 
I just think we're at that point I really feel  
[30:00] like I'm not in the group of people that believe 
in diminishing returns I'm in the group of people  
[30:07] that believes in gradually then suddenly I do 
believe in a super cycle hyperbitcoinization I  
[30:14] believe in all that so I don't see how it can 
just be a suddenly thing or a gradual Thing  
[30:22] Once all these like dominoes line up you know 
so it'll just it's already starting to happen  
[30:30] like things are starting to tip and I think 
it's just going to you know unravel and and  
[30:35] I don't think it won't be a it won't have to be 
between peaceful it'll it'll be a revolution but  
[30:41] it doesn't have to be uh you know in a civil 
war type way or a peaceful way because I just  
[30:49] think most people won't even know you know I just 
think it it's just going to be like that it's just  
[30:53] going to be like a silent little Revolution 
going on trickling through the system it's a  
[30:58] great way to look at that I think I'm very much 
subscribed to that because it's a it's like the  
[31:04] tcpip protocol and the internet itself um I met 
actually uh in what was it 2021 or 2022 I met uh  
[31:16] from my French part of my family uh an an very far 
related Uncle um uh he was very much against the  
[31:27] internet and he said the same thing that Bitcoin 
critics say about the internet and I was like wow  
[31:34] those people are still around like people would 
say like oh the internet is it's just temporary  
[31:38] there and it will completely go away and we will 
go back to where where we were like 1972 or like  
[31:46] whatever so um it it's super interesting to 
to hear those arguments and I heard them the  
[31:52] first time ever from a real person in real life H 
against internet which I usually only he against  
[32:00] Bitcoin like it was literally like if you just 
exchange the word internet with Bitcoin it like  
[32:05] it it would have fitted and and then when you go 
back to like when internet came popular the same  
[32:11] thing happened same thing even with electricity 
electricity the same thing happened so uh you're  
[32:18] very much right with like it's it's a Bas layer 
technology which just spreads organically and  
[32:25] people don't even know about it that's that's 
genius I love that I think it's just it's the only  
[32:29] way like I keep trying to wrap my head around how 
things will play out and uh yeah I just I really  
[32:34] I really wish I remember who said that who who 
I don't I feel like it was a sailor thing but I  
[32:39] feel like somebody maybe it was Jeff Booth I don't 
know but it was somebody who said that it's just  
[32:47] when the majority of the world is using it it's 
just going to be something that they just have  
[32:51] to use cuz it's there it's like it's just it's 
just so it's the only way I see it happening so  
[32:56] um I I just think it's uh it's already there it's 
already on its way so you know we're just kind of  
[33:01] witnessing it um and I think this is literally 
just going to be a crazy year I really feel this  
[33:09] this year into next year is going to be wild and 
I don't think it'll slow down from that point I  
[33:13] feel like we've been through so much pain because 
I feel I really feel like the 2020 cycle was cut  
[33:20] short um you know was attacked um and I do think 
that because the people that attacked it or cut  
[33:30] it short or manipulated markets um in order to 
kind of bring this economic shift to kind of slow  
[33:37] things down until they were involved now they are 
involved so now things can like they can like Let  
[33:42] It Rip I think is what's going to happen so you 
know it's just because they were like jealous  
[33:48] sitting on the sidelines like they couldn't uh 
they couldn't get in on it you know and um it's  
[33:54] just wild it's it's so crazy and then just hearing 
um even about the whole silent aspect like how you  
[34:02] don't hear much about it it's always on the back 
of people's minds why Elon doesn't really mention  
[34:08] Bitcoin and it it kind of Nags at us a little bit 
too because we know how Pro you know Bitcoin like  
[34:16] Tesla owns Bitcoin um they haven't sold it um 
it's I get why he doesn't mention it it's but  
[34:25] some people think oh he has enough fat why would 
he care about Bitcoin and they just kind of smack  
[34:31] talk him that way I believe he really truly does 
understand Technologies and he's a smart human  
[34:37] being and he um he knows that when he talks too 
much about something it brings a level of hatred  
[34:45] to something that he likes because if let's say 
the richest person in the world starts talking  
[34:52] about Bitcoin why it's so great because Tesla owns 
some and he owns some it's only to bring people  
[34:58] back saying well you just want to make yourself 
richer you're just greedy you know so I feel like  
[35:04] him him mentioning it isn't going to do Bitcoin 
any good he knows he knows I think what Bitcoin  
[35:09] is and he knows that it's going to do what it's 
going to do regardless of him saying something  
[35:14] or not um so I do truly believe he he loves it he 
wants to see it succeed he's all about freedom and  
[35:21] you know uh transparency and you know what he's 
doing with the government is amazing it's uh it's  
[35:28] like my fun time every day watching this play out 
too uh watching all the fraud get exposed um but I  
[35:34] do believe that he he loves he loves Bitcoin and 
I think that he just doesn't want to hurt um not  
[35:40] that you can hurt it really anyway um but what's 
the point of him trying to talk good about it so  
[35:46] they could just say he's greedy he's a uh it was 
it's so funny because I was actually asked today  
[35:54] on a podcast where I was guest on uh who who 
would would you like to interview who's still  
[36:00] living and I said Ed musk because I and I I told 
him I would like to interview him because I think  
[36:07] he's more of a bitcoiner uh that than we realize 
I think yeah he Tesla is still the only company  
[36:14] in the S&P 500 that owns Bitcoin uh people keep 
forgetting that Tesla owns Bitcoin still I think  
[36:20] like almost 10,000 Bitcoin that's not nothing 
yes Tesla could own way more uh if they make a  
[36:27] micro strategy strategy with with Tesla they own 
a lot of Bitcoin but first of all I'm against  
[36:34] institutions and and companies only Bitcoin 
so I always like if they take it slow I like  
[36:41] when regular people have more chance and longer 
time to accumulate Bitcoin but he's a true he he  
[36:48] understands austan economics he Retreats austan 
economics uh he talked with M about it uh and I  
[36:56] I think he understands Bitcoin better than than 
than we think uh and it's I think it's just not  
[37:02] something um that he pays attention too much right 
now I think there's so much with his rockets and  
[37:09] and Tesla and now he's fighting governments and 
he's not only doing that in America he's now also  
[37:14] doing it in Europe uh with Germany elections 
and probably other elections too so he's just  
[37:22] very busy on so many levels like I don't know I 
agree with that I have one other take on on that  
[37:27] a little bit because you know I think he yeah he's 
got a million projects who knows even how he does  
[37:34] this I mean this is just insane like I don't know 
he manages it all like it's just ridiculous but um  
[37:42] especially the government aspect like fighting the 
government now that's like the big you know like  
[37:47] how do you have time to do anything else but um 
but the thing that I think is like if anyone was  
[37:53] if Elon I feel like this is just me my ideas you 
know but when he decided to buy Twitter I feel  
[38:02] like he was mad enough at not only censorship but 
it was almost like even when he was promoting Doge  
[38:13] um he was on SNL during that bull run Doge going 
to the Moon you know like promoting it and talking  
[38:20] about Doge all the time and you know I feel like 
once one once the government attacked or the SEC  
[38:29] kept attacking crypto in general not just Bitcoin 
just crypto the whole Space there was a war on  
[38:35] crypto choke point 2.0 all this stuff was going 
on um I think it made Elon look like a fool and  
[38:43] maybe he was just mad enough about like hey you 
made me look stupid like I shilled this coin or  
[38:48] whatever told people and then you now now you're 
attacking me saying I because he promoted it he  
[38:55] was being sued by the SEC I think and stuff like 
that um because of promoting Dogecoin and this  
[39:00] and that so it's like he wasn't doing it to try 
to harm people I think he really thought that we  
[39:06] were at some point in 2020 that this Market was 
going to become like you know this is the new  
[39:12] Financial you know like crypto is the way type of 
thing um so I just think that maybe like he got  
[39:18] pissed off enough that he's like you know what 
these people totally attack not just the entire  
[39:23] industry because he was all about like Bitcoin 
Twitter you know and uh and he was talking about  
[39:30] it you know so I think for him to be made to look 
like a fool is enough of a reason for somebody to  
[39:36] turn around say you know what I'm gonna I'm GNA 
stop this so it's it's it's also interesting how  
[39:42] he gets involved in things that piss him off a 
little bit like the the government thing I I I I  
[39:49] think he's now getting into government not because 
he wants to influence things uh like that's not  
[39:56] the sole purpose it's the purpose of like he was 
mad at the administration from Biden and he was  
[40:05] like they they didn't invite me to the EV thing 
even though they are most American cars uh and  
[40:11] the the and Biden was driving with Ford electric 
and and Tesla is clearly the leader in EV uh like  
[40:18] the the numbers just just don't support that at 
all uh so like and he was really mad and that's  
[40:24] why I think he really decided to go on in on the 
the government thing I think if the administration  
[40:30] in Biden was very friendly to him and and was 
not attacking him I think he probably would  
[40:36] have not done it um one thing in the time he Tesla 
adopted Bitcoin I remember on the conference calls  
[40:45] because back then I was still 5050 Bitcoin and 
Tesla holding um and Tesla and he said something  
[40:53] really interesting uh he said uh in Germany 
you have to pay a negative interest rates if  
[41:00] you hold money on the bank account and he's like 
I will never give Germany that money I will just  
[41:05] buy Bitcoin with that he literally said that on 
a conference call when they adopted Bitcoin uh so  
[41:11] so for him I think he has to see a clear problem 
that um he cares enough about and maybe there's  
[41:21] like one uh valid point of people saying like oh 
like he's he's benefiting from field system maybe  
[41:29] the different perspective is like the the feeld 
system is not pissing him off enough because he  
[41:35] has like he has no problem with spending fear 
like he has bank accounts uh he is unlimited  
[41:44] resources to venture capital to credit to Banks 
to all of that um and he's not subject to like um  
[41:53] uh any any like bans or anything like that so if 
banks would have started to kick him out or like  
[42:03] ban Tesla or like do anything like that I think he 
might actually go more ha on on on bitcoin um but  
[42:14] it it's just guessing from my side how what what 
what's in his mind from at that point but um I I  
[42:21] watched him a lot in the past years yeah sorry no 
go ahead that that's what is that that's what is  
[42:28] um yeah so I mean I just think that he um he when 
you said he's mad enough when he gets mad enough  
[42:36] about something when he sees a clear problem and 
I think that one clear problem he sees is the you  
[42:41] know the overregulation of the government being 
that you know now they're attacking him for from  
[42:48] the SEC he he was getting attacked constantly um 
for buying Twitter or even wanting to buy Twitter  
[42:53] in the first place but just um I think giving him 
you know the contracts and then even he was saying  
[43:00] something about even like lawsuits like something 
about hiring workers but then he had he had to  
[43:06] do it or he would get fined but then if he didn't 
but then he's not supposed to because the workers  
[43:11] have to be of a certain type of you know like you 
know background as far as like how much they know  
[43:17] about what they're doing because it's a safety 
issue um so then there's contradicting laws on  
[43:24] what he's supposed to do for SpaceX let's say so 
he's pissed off because he goes you have these  
[43:29] two dumb you know government organizations that 
one's telling me to do one thing one's the other  
[43:36] and either way I'm going to get sued so it's 
like there's just too much government overlap  
[43:42] and nobody knows what's going on there's too many 
rules and no one knows what the actual rules are  
[43:47] he's sick of getting attacked and um another 
thing is too then he's got the a lot of Fiat  
[43:53] money right you know he pays the highest Fiat tax 
is for anyone in the world right and then when you  
[44:00] find out the type of government waste that's been 
happening you figure not only why do we pay taxes  
[44:07] but why does he pay taxes you know it's like this 
money that he's just and they keep wanting him to  
[44:13] pay more people are saying well you're the richest 
man in the world why shouldn't you pay even more  
[44:16] taxes to help the world well he would if it was 
going to a good place but it's getting spent and  
[44:24] stolen left and right so he has point you know so 
I feel like I'm I'm on his side with that too so  
[44:30] I feel like there's many reasons but I feel like 
all this is leading toward a better future of less  
[44:36] government control and more decentralization which 
is a Bitcoin you know future I just think either  
[44:42] way it's just headed that in that direction so 
it's good for Bitcoin anyway yeah like I was just  
[44:48] Googling the number uh in 2022 his tax bill was 11 
billion and it's like like how many people uh have  
[44:57] you have to work for how long like how long has 
the average worker to work to contribute that many  
[45:04] tax dolls to the system it's just incredible like 
like I get so mad at people when they say like  
[45:11] oh the rich don't pay tax I'm like really the the 
rich pay all the tax they they pay 80% they might  
[45:19] not pay the same percentage maybe they have a 
lower percentage of that but the lower percentage  
[45:24] what they pay is a majority of the overall income 
and that's what the Socialists don't get of like  
[45:32] if you if you make bad laws to the Socialist 
get out of your country you don't have income  
[45:38] there's a point uh if you reach that point the of 
tax rates and go higher your tax income actually  
[45:45] decreases because people are leaving or cheating 
right yeah and that's why I think it's just enough  
[45:51] is enough because it's like the Cure the cure 
for this situation isn't to tax the rich more  
[45:58] to spread the wealth because just if you tax 
the rich more it'll just have more money that  
[46:01] can be stolen you know there's not going to it's 
not going to help the people that want that need  
[46:06] it I think that's what their their misconception 
is they think that they're fighting for something  
[46:14] that that is a lie you know so it's like open 
your eyes you know I just think that people  
[46:20] need to start to wake up and the more that some of 
these agencies get audited too people will really  
[46:26] realize how much our government has been um I mean 
there's some good that happens there's some good  
[46:32] money spent on good things but there's just way 
too much theft and um no um accountability for  
[46:40] these people absolutely it's it's it's a great way 
to look at it um you mentioned before uh Bitcoin  
[46:47] at 1% adoption we're still at 1% something like 
that I remember what are you looking at in terms  
[46:53] of adoption because there's a lot of different 
numbers out there people say like oh like we are  
[46:57] not at 1% oh people say like we at 7% it's kind of 
confusing for me of like what even how even look  
[47:04] at that I think it's it's probably I mean I don't 
know I think I might have heard 3% I don't know if  
[47:10] I've heard seven but I might have heard three but 
again it is very hard to really know because how  
[47:16] many people have multiple Bitcoin wallets you know 
so if you have 3% of the population that you think  
[47:22] there's this many Bitcoin wallets that percentage 
of the population but some people have 10 wallets  
[47:26] you know some people have three some you know so 
how much is it way less than we think of the yeah  
[47:33] also like there are wallets out there where there 
are multiple people on that wallet because it's an  
[47:39] exchange for example uh and they they maybe have 
uh 10 million users but not 10 million addresses  
[47:48] uh they might have like I don't know 100,000 
addresses or like a million addresses uh so  
[47:54] there's a lot of variables on that so instead of 
it being like one person having multiple wallets  
[48:00] now you have institutions having less wallets 
for a ton of people so yeah so that's really  
[48:05] hard to gauge from which one is stronger it's 
like impossible to know that right that's why  
[48:11] I'm always wondering how to figure out and also um 
another point is like what is one person adopted  
[48:20] Bitcoin mean like does he has to have like 1% 
of his wealth in Bitcoin is that a a Bitcoin or  
[48:26] is that a person that's called or does he has 
to have like 50% of his wealth in Bitcoin it's  
[48:32] get it's get very complicated I think so I would 
say it is because when people say that whole you  
[48:37] only need like 0.01 Bitcoin and you'll be good you 
know kind of thing like in the future based on how  
[48:42] how much the price will go up over the years so 
I think anybody who does have that just holds it  
[48:47] even if they have $100 they just let it sit there 
for 15 years you know they'll be happy they did  
[48:52] that um you know so if everybody out today went 
and bought $100 with the Bitcoin you know what I  
[48:57] mean that would be depleting you know Supply uh 
exchanges whatever they have in in reserves so I  
[49:03] think that uh yeah I think that any allocation to 
it would count um but there's so many people that  
[49:10] they buy it and then they sell it and they have 
a wallet open and now they don't own the Bitcoin  
[49:15] anymore because they sold it you know so it's 
like there's a lot of those people too um but I  
[49:20] definitely think that you know if you understand 
it once you understand it um you don't have 1%  
[49:30] of your net worth or 2% of your net worth in it 
you know I think you take whatever you would be  
[49:35] able to have as savings um and you just fully 
put it in there to like store you know I think  
[49:43] it's a million times better than having it in the 
stock market um or a CD or anything like that so  
[49:50] I think yeah once people understand it they they 
just convert you know whatever they don't need to  
[49:54] spend absolutely yeah it's it's like on once you 
get into that rabbit hole like you you're going  
[50:01] deeper and deeper and deeper you you it's just a 
oneway ticket to going all in Bitcoin which is a  
[50:09] a fascinating F and and I hope I hope uh I do hope 
we have more more Bitcoin adoption uh that is uh  
[50:18] better and better with preventing mistakes uh and 
I do think people that come in 2024 have a major  
[50:25] advantage in preventing mistakes and having 
a quicker Orange Building Story going quicker  
[50:32] preventing in mistakes of custody uh than people 
in 2020 and then people in 2017 and people in 2013  
[50:39] and stuff like that uh so um I I I do see that 
what what are you kind of expecting for for this  
[50:46] cycle to happen you you already mentioned a little 
bit of like you don't think it it's slowing down  
[50:51] you're thinking of like um Bitcoin returns are are 
getting bigger not not diminishing and stuff like  
[50:58] that yeah um so you think as far as like price 
oh well you want to take it like priz is I think  
[51:05] the the end signal of that but there's like a 
lot of uh things that I think priz is just the  
[51:11] consequence of of things and the other things are 
kind of the the fundamental ones yeah I think that  
[51:18] um there's just going to be you know I I'm I'm 
still thinking this strategic Reserve is about to  
[51:24] happen uh even hearing from um the cryptar what's 
his name David saxs I think um even hearing from  
[51:33] him and talking about how there's going to be he 
briefly mentioning it again another one of those  
[51:38] situations where they're super quiet about it and 
they don't they don't talk about it too much but  
[51:41] it was like right at the end of the interview uh 
the reporter asked about the Bitcoin reserve and  
[51:47] he did say that you know Bitcoin strategic Reserve 
he mentioned that you know so it wasn't a crypto  
[51:52] reserve it was Bitcoin only so I think that um 
that's going to be coming soon once they educate  
[52:01] the people in the government that need to kind of 
just go through and just all vote for this thing  
[52:07] um which is that's that's that's the um the hurdle 
that they have to jump they have to you know the  
[52:14] education is is a big part of it so again there's 
so many people that would say no initially because  
[52:19] they don't know it or don't understand what it 
is but once they find out and have uh actual  
[52:25] information they would they would 100% say yes 
this is a good idea so um so I think that that's  
[52:32] going to be happening there's also that uh the 
fby accounting rule that's why another reason why  
[52:37] GameStop I think is uh finally had that meeting 
with sailor um and a lot of other companies would  
[52:42] follow suit um Banks I guess banks are now able 
to custody it in the US so and this is all just  
[52:51] us news that the rest of the world is already um 
you know nation states here and like everywhere  
[52:57] that you hear they're all putting up their own 
strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill you know to start  
[53:03] buying Bitcoin too so um I mean El Salvador is a 
case where they've been doing it for how long and  
[53:09] they've shown that they're doing very well um from 
converting their country to a Bitcoin standard you  
[53:17] know so um I just see that there's just only good 
things like I feel like um sorry I thought I had  
[53:27] this on do not disturb um yeah I just think 
that there's this year is going to be super  
[53:33] interesting I think that I find it hard to believe 
that Bitcoin wouldn't hit a million dollars this  
[53:38] year like I I feel like it would just happen 
somehow super fast like I feel like we would  
[53:44] just and I think most people still would just not 
care we'll care we'll be very happy you know the  
[53:50] governments and everybody else I think we'll be 
very happy but I think once it hits 200,000 those  
[53:55] same people still won't care because they'll think 
well I didn't get any of it it's too late still or  
[54:00] when it hits 1 million they'll still say oh well 
I didn't get any of that it's or it's going to  
[54:03] tank down to 500,000 you're crazy for holding 
it still it's going to be the same story over  
[54:09] and over again like just like just on ree you know 
and then even sailor says anything you don't buy  
[54:15] now will cost you $13 million I don't know in the 
next 20 years or something he says so it's just  
[54:21] like people will still continue to just think well 
you better put get those puts you better you know  
[54:26] just sell some sell it before you lose all your 
money and stuff people will just not understand  
[54:31] the fact that it's a fixed asset and that you 
know there's all this buying pressure globally  
[54:37] so I just think I think it would be um I would be 
surprised if it weren't to hit a million this year  
[54:44] or early next year I think um that that's a like 
I think that that would be amazing to see in one  
[54:55] year okay and then a million the next one I think 
it's possible and then seeing the reaction of the  
[55:02] of of of the people that that would be just 
absolutely uh so funny and I would love that  
[55:09] because that gives a lot of great talking points 
on the podcast and a lot of great interesting  
[55:15] conversations around that um but yeah like that 
that would be just uh absolutely absurd I I would  
[55:23] love that but yeah I I kind of more bearish on 
on this this year uh like I think everything is  
[55:28] possible but I I do think we we're not crossing 
the half a million but like a million would be  
[55:34] that would be crazy I think I think half a million 
it's like okay that could it's still but I think  
[55:40] that when they say the only reason I really think 
it is because Bitcoin does what you least expect  
[55:45] just like how we thought once it hit a million 
100,000 we thought oh now price Discovery is  
[55:49] going to go crazy 250 from here and it didn't 
it's just hanging out right now but I think that  
[55:56] it's going to shock people like right now it's 
shocking us with how how is it not going up faster  
[56:01] why is it sitting around at this price for so long 
um and I think people like maybe part of it too  
[56:08] is to try to like with all this big money playing 
these Fiat games to make us so bored of the price  
[56:15] action so that when it does hit 250 or three we're 
like oh finally got there this is probably it like  
[56:22] we've waited for so long and it's just been 
boring you know so they think we're going to  
[56:26] sell off some of it or just you know try to like 
do the whole trading thing and then and then it'll  
[56:32] just continue going and we'll be you know caught 
off sides ourselves so I think that they just it's  
[56:38] just maybe to get us to think oh thank God for 
this amount we want we need this so bad the econom  
[56:45] is so bad you know everything's been so rough 
my family is struggling we need to sell at some  
[56:49] point we've held out and now it's time because 
I think just like I don't know trying to make it  
[56:54] boring enough for us to be appreciating 250 or 
three you know uh to think that we should sell  
[57:00] for some profit absolutely what were your first 
thoughts when you heard about uh Trump the Bitcoin  
[57:08] conference and Trump being elected and then he's 
talking about strategic Bitcoin Reserve so I was  
[57:13] um I was just again a little skeptical because I 
just feel like I don't he did the nft thing for so  
[57:22] long and all that stuff and I was just not sure 
what is what he was fully planning to do I just  
[57:27] thought it was really good that a voice like a 
large um voice with a lot of following was going  
[57:33] to the Bitcoin conference and speaking about it 
I thought that was good for Bitcoin because I'm  
[57:37] like okay people that are Trump supporters 
will maybe hear it but I just think that's  
[57:43] so many people that I mean in real life I know 
a lot of people that are Trump supporters that  
[57:50] they know he they know everything about him 
they know everything that happens but they  
[57:56] don't know that he went to the Bitcoin conference 
you know like I don't think any of the people like  
[58:02] cuz a lot of it's like a lot of like people that 
I know from my work and just there's there's a  
[58:09] huge um Trump you know Republican I don't know 
just uh support and I just don't hear anybody  
[58:14] say oh did you hear he was at that Bitcoin thing 
I'm going to go buy some Bitcoin nobody ever says  
[58:18] that so I just think it's like we know it anyone 
who supports Trump that's also a Bitcoin knows it  
[58:24] bitcoiner knows it but I don't think the majority 
of people really it didn't take hold in their  
[58:30] minds um but then I was happy when you know he he 
won because I was just I was on the fence about  
[58:38] him for for a long time um but then I just feel 
like I get sick of the the theft the government  
[58:48] the econom has just been terrible and when you had 
somebody who was going to back him like Elon who  
[58:53] wants to get rid of theft and and waste I thought 
that was amazing plus hearing about the Strategic  
[58:59] reserve of course you know that's that's something 
that the US should do do you not want to get left  
[59:05] behind you know other countries are adopting it we 
need to do it you know there's no other choice and  
[59:10] then you heard crickets from the opposite end 
you know so it was just really confusing you  
[59:17] know I just didn't understand um so yeah I think 
it'll be overall good I think it's just going to  
[59:23] be um I Heard even I think the and the Senate have 
primarily Bitcoin positive uh you know members so  
[59:33] I think that's that's going to be really good also 
yeah I love that America is against steamrolling  
[59:39] ahead and I I think EU is kind of two two and a 
half years maybe three years behind I I see the I  
[59:48] see slowly slowly some uh conversations happening 
uh like Czech is only one one part of it but also  
[59:55] like Germany there are some um Party leaders that 
are now on going on bitcoin podcasts um that have  
[60:04] significant chance of like being elected in in 
the in the Parliament and stuff like that so  
[60:09] that there things happening and also that I think 
the because you mentioned that the Trump rally uh  
[60:15] the Trump going to the bitco conference we we are 
the only one me uh uh seeing that it's 100% true  
[60:21] but but I think it's mostly because he went to so 
many rallies like so many conferences uh it's it's  
[60:29] kind of astonishing for me that is at his age he 
is so fit I I want to be that fit in his age like  
[60:37] that that's like wow uh I don't know if he does 
it naturally or he uses something I don't know  
[60:43] uh but he definitely has a lot of power and a lot 
of Fitness for his age for for going to all those  
[60:51] rallies because he like he was at like 10 hours 
before the Bitcoin conference somewhere then like  
[60:56] hours after the Bitcoin comments I'm like where 
does he sleep like where does he fit that in  
[61:01] that's super interesting also to see that too yeah 
I just think that there's a like we look at that  
[61:08] and we think wow I couldn't do that you know so 
it's like just wild how much he's traveling and  
[61:12] going to everything and able to speak and have the 
energy to speak on every like all these different  
[61:17] places it's just kind of wild absolutely really 
cool um one more thing that I want to get into  
[61:22] the podcast is I saw you have an a Twitter 
community on X Community called the paranoid  
[61:30] Bitcoin Anarchist I love the name how did this 
come together oh God it's amazing um I'm so happy  
[61:37] with it it's it's been since probably December 
um it's it started off with I remember seeing the  
[61:47] Bitcoin therapist's account tweet something about 
getting monetized so he's like if we all just get  
[61:53] monetized we'll buy more Bitcoin you know we'll 
just use that money to just keep stacking so I  
[61:58] thought wow that's a great idea I haven't really 
ever tried um that hard like I was posting all  
[62:04] the time but I just never I never knew how to get 
any engagement like I had zero like nobody would  
[62:11] ever see my post but um after I saw that I was 
inspired um so I created U I think one post about  
[62:17] uh following more female bitcoiners CU I'm like 
there's so many other women out there um that just  
[62:24] probably I just don't know I know a few like large 
accounts like I know like a good amount but not  
[62:29] like that many compared to the amount of men in 
the space so I just put up a pulse and all these  
[62:33] women started commenting and Men started sharing 
it and it was it was a pretty cool moment and  
[62:39] um and that just inspired me to create like all 
these people started interacting with me so then  
[62:46] I started I just I felt like it was actually like 
my my account was getting seen and I the people  
[62:53] that I was interacting with were really interested 
people I would look at their stuff and they just  
[62:57] had such great ideas and it made me realize that 
yeah the bigger accounts they're so smart and I've  
[63:04] learned so much from them over the years but 
there's so many people that don't have a huge  
[63:08] following that have such unique perspectives and 
I love I love always learning and just seeing what  
[63:13] everyone has to say so um I truly found everyone 
fascinating it's not like I'm just trying to do  
[63:19] it just to build my account I'm actually like 
interested in um in what people are thinking so  
[63:26] that's what I think it is it's like part of it 
is you if you show people that you know you care  
[63:33] about their stuff then they kind of you know they 
want to check up on you too it's like you bu build  
[63:37] these like friendships so I started doing that 
with a lot of the people that um would interact  
[63:42] with me and I would just look at everybody and 
try to find interesting people was so many to  
[63:46] sift through and I I was Finding awesome 
stuff um so the more I interacted they did  
[63:51] too and then I decided to create this community 
because it was just easier I saw that everyone  
[63:56] else had communities I thought why not try it so 
I just the name all I thought about was with how  
[64:03] sailor mentioned one day about paranoid crypto or 
crypto Anarchist so then I just made ours Bitcoin  
[64:08] Anarchist um and it was just the first thing that 
that came to mind and I just put it in there I  
[64:13] thought it was a temporary name until uh until we 
actually picked something together um but then I  
[64:20] just started inviting all these people and it's 
just been you know really really amazing and they  
[64:25] just um they didn't want to change the name they 
loved it they were like no we're keeping it it's  
[64:31] awesome you know it actually like embodies a lot 
of how we feel you know we're all a little bit  
[64:35] paranoid that's why we got into Bitcoin in the 
first place you know being a little skeptical  
[64:40] about the system and what they're doing um and 
then I don't know so many cool people like the  
[64:45] other day um Walker America joined our group and 
then Carla just joined our group and I just feel  
[64:55] like it's it's really surreal it's just so cool 
to have people that I've admired and looked up to  
[64:59] um joining our group it's it's amazing so um and 
everyone's super hyped about it and it feels like  
[65:06] a big family so I love that that's great that's 
really cool and it's actually kind of also nicely  
[65:14] playing with that podcast because that's one big 
mission that I now have because of the podcast  
[65:20] giving a stage to people that have never been on a 
podcast before I think I have the highest rate of  
[65:25] guests on that have never been on any podcast 
and they the first time appearing on mine or  
[65:32] U maybe they only have been on like one or two 
because there are some speakers that are like on  
[65:38] every week on some podcast it feels like in they 
taking the round so I think that that's a that's  
[65:44] a great uh thing to do and also the the group 
and the community thing uh is something very  
[65:51] very important uh to have in Bitcoin uh no matter 
where where uh but this belonging this group thing  
[65:59] this community thing it's it's something very 
important uh to have inside the bit community  
[66:03] so I think it's great what you're doing that I 
think that that we'll have a lot of great and  
[66:09] positive resonations with that cool thank you yeah 
no people are just super it's so sweet hearing  
[66:15] people say like they just they felt like they were 
just walking alone in the world and it's like now  
[66:20] you have like a people that hear you and see you 
and you don't feel so alone even though it's just  
[66:24] online you know um so it's just you actually 
can like make a difference for people when you  
[66:29] actually tell them you appreciate something you 
know instead of just seeing it lurking in the  
[66:33] background and um you know thinking something's a 
great idea but just not actually commenting on it  
[66:38] it's like tell them let them know because they 
could really make a difference in their day and  
[66:42] their life and um to see to know that somebody 
actually cares or heard them you know so it's  
[66:48] it's it's amazing and I thank you for having me 
on your show because I've seen so many of your  
[66:54] podcasts and you know I look up to you and you're 
amazing and just I was really nervous being on  
[67:00] here today too because I've only done one other 
and um she made me feel super comfortable and um  
[67:07] the reason I even did hers was because starting 
this group once she reached out and asked me  
[67:13] to do it I was terrified um again I'm not a a 
finance person I'm not somebody who's you know  
[67:20] well known in the space at all nobody knows me 
but um I just feel like when she asked me I was  
[67:25] like I I should do this because you know it would 
give other people inspiration to to speak because  
[67:31] there's so many people that have something to say 
um you don't have to be in finance you could just  
[67:36] have an opinion or a Viewpoint or some some 
interesting angle how you see things going um  
[67:42] and everyone when you know enough about a subject 
you can talk like I think people just think that  
[67:49] um you know you need to be a good speaker you 
can't you know you're shy but when you know about  
[67:55] something and you're passionate about something 
like most people are so passionate about a Bitcoin  
[68:00] you can talk about it because you care so much 
about it so it's like don't be afraid I wanted  
[68:05] to not only show myself that I wasn't afraid but 
I wanted to show them that you know because I did  
[68:12] it like they can they can be a little more Brave 
too you know um and that's why even with yours  
[68:17] too I was like you know I feel like I'm nervous 
you know but it's it it's gone great I you know  
[68:23] you've made me feel super comfortable and uh I 
really appreciate it and it's awesome to have  
[68:28] a platform and to know that you've had people 
like sailor on your show and you want to have  
[68:36] somebody like Elon which I think is possible and 
amazing um you know it's it's it's just crazy to  
[68:43] think that you you're so open-minded about just 
hearing everyone's perspective I love that so it's  
[68:50] not just big accounts it's not just well-known 
people it's like let let people speak and you get  
[68:55] uh a more real view of the world that way you know 
it's not like a not to say it's an echo chamber  
[69:01] but when you hear the same like you said out the 
same podcast or person speaking two three times a  
[69:07] week it's like we've like how much more unique 
perspective can you have from like one person  
[69:15] you know so it's nice to to spread it around I 
I see that uh one speaker they only rare most  
[69:25] most speakers have one two three different things 
they want to talk about but it's very one unique  
[69:33] perspective they're only rare instances like a 
sailor they can talk about the same thing 100  
[69:40] times and it's every time interesting yes because 
they have so many different ways of getting to the  
[69:46] same point but you have to be so freaking good 
as a speaker uh to do that and you have to have  
[69:51] so much information and experience and stuff like 
that in there uh so having a podcast which exists  
[69:59] of the same people all over again is getting 
boring after a while um I think that's why what  
[70:06] Bitcoin did is kind of great what what they are 
doing now with uh Mr obnoxious because uh he's now  
[70:13] venturing into new conversations with new people I 
don't know if he needed to do the the name change  
[70:20] for that uh but it's great that that he Ventures 
out and tries to get to to other people because  
[70:26] that's the only way we grow uh and for me from 
the beginning I didn't knew where the podcast was  
[70:33] going but once I started it and once I had just 
people on that are new from conferences or new  
[70:40] from Twitter and they never had been on a podcast 
I saw not only how popular that was but also how  
[70:48] enriching that was from my perspective because of 
course I can invite jef PO for times a year um but  
[70:59] what is the benefit of doing so like obviously 
once a year and maybe that's a great um ribm uh  
[71:06] to get a fresh perspective and he's also a great 
thinker of like he gets a new thing but like do we  
[71:12] need those great people like like literally every 
other week uh like to it I don't think there's a  
[71:19] big uh value in that so what I'm trying to do is 
now getting great big speakers also on uh because  
[71:28] uh they give a bigger stage also to uh the the 
people that have never been on a podcast before  
[71:35] uh and this allows me to build a stage where uh 
as the the most amount of different perspectives  
[71:44] ever graded uh in Bitcoin come together and maybe 
just maybe if I do it long enough on any platform  
[71:52] on any podcast and how amazing would that be 
if this podcast uh is the only one that is  
[71:58] doing daily interviews with 365 uh guests per 
year doing that for 10 20 40 years having the  
[72:08] biggest variety of interviews for human beings on 
Earth on any topic because I I didn't find anyone  
[72:18] doing the same thing and if that thing would have 
started with Bitcoin like as it did with that  
[72:25] I think it would be amazing if if I can do that 
story that's why I'm so passionate about keeping  
[72:30] that Bitcoin uh podcast going doing it daily doing 
with so many different people as possible and also  
[72:37] venturing out I have now two UFC fight on I will 
have the third UFC fight on and I will venture  
[72:44] out and and uh right now I only want to have 
bitcoiners on uh because I think that's the the  
[72:50] bottom line of the podcast but I have bitcoiners 
on that have Bitcoin but we talk about something  
[72:56] else like parenting or like UFC or like sports and 
I think that's how I hopefully sorry to go on the  
[73:04] tangent but hopefully I I I get like a really big 
library of great people and perspectives uh so we  
[73:11] can all learn from each other and uh that I'm 
I'm really passionate about uh that even though  
[73:17] this was not the intention of the podcast when I 
start involved in that I think that that's amazing  
[73:24] and and I think that you are doing a great thing 
because you never know who you'll reach and you  
[73:32] never know what moment it's going to be for that 
person that they it click it clicks for them like  
[73:39] it might be you saying something specific it might 
be that person that has never been on a podcast  
[73:45] before that says something to the right person at 
the right time that just all of a sudden now they  
[73:50] get it like there's there's a moment for everybody 
and I just think that the more variety you have  
[73:56] that there's more chances to to ignite that or to 
like spark something in more people um and and for  
[74:04] yourself like you said it enriches you too because 
you want to do this so that you could learn um and  
[74:09] keep it exciting you know you're you're excited 
when you hear different thoughts and ideas it  
[74:13] makes it's you engage uh with those new thoughts 
and ideas and you want to challenge your own your  
[74:19] own beliefs and just kind of like grow you know so 
I think that's amazing you should even look into  
[74:26] um how you said you have UFC fighters I've heard 
a lot of oh man this would be crazy but I've heard  
[74:31] that like some football players and NBA players 
are bitcoiners it'd be cool to get some of those  
[74:38] athletes on on your show that would be amazing 
I have to look into that if if I can reach out  
[74:42] to some that'd be crazy I even know that um my 
husband shared it with me but I thought it was  
[74:48] so cool um I've always loved Yan SATA kumbo from 
the Milwaukee Bucks but he um he shared a picture  
[74:57] with me of his teammate Damen Lillard wearing a 
Satoshi um like sweater like two different days  
[75:04] I'm like he's a Satoshi fan that's amazing so it's 
like it' be so cool to get um again some of these  
[75:10] athletes they're probably just they've never 
probably ever been asked to be on something and  
[75:14] maybe because they are bitcoiners um any of these 
athletes normally maybe they wouldn't want to do a  
[75:20] different type of interview because they're busy 
but when it comes to something you're passionate  
[75:23] about too why wouldn't you want to talk about 
it have someone be interested in your hobby that  
[75:28] nobody else cares about when it's you know because 
nobody else it does feel like you're alone it  
[75:32] feels like even for you having me on here or for 
my you know Twitter Community like it just makes  
[75:38] you feel like I do have this interest that nobody 
else around knows about or because you feel so  
[75:45] lonely in in real life um to be able to talk about 
it is is just something that is a gift for people  
[75:50] so I think that it it would probably be uh just 
like a cool addition you know to add not just not  
[75:57] just the regular people but um you know maybe some 
athletes or something since you're already doing  
[76:02] UFC guys yeah I I try to venure out in in as many 
region as possible and the great thing is in every  
[76:10] aspect of life there are Bitcoin that's that's 
the advantage uh with that yeah really cool I  
[76:17] have one question that I asked each and every one 
of my guest and the question is what can we learn  
[76:20] from you besides Bitcoin oh what can you learn 
from me besides Bitcoin coin um I am a wife I'm  
[76:29] a mother I have three kids um I have a 13-year-old 
a 11-year-old and a 9-year-old um and I got into  
[76:39] Bitcoin because of them so yeah I'm again bringing 
it back to bitcoin but it's like uh I did get into  
[76:45] it because of them my family um but they mean more 
to me than anything and that's why uh you know you  
[76:51] have to go out and search for answers you know you 
have to find what's the best way for them you know  
[76:56] but um but yeah I have my three kids and watching 
them grow uh is is just the best I love being a  
[77:04] mom and I love being a wife and uh my husband 
is amazing he's so supportive and um you know  
[77:11] he actually oh my husband made this shirt for me 
so this is my favorite quote don't borrow from the  
[77:16] future buy the future so he made this I love that 
wow cool so yeah so I just uh he has like a little  
[77:25] hobby like you know making little designs but he 
he made this for me so I could wear it because uh  
[77:31] um people liked it when I I put it on my page 
and um Paula Iverson that had me on last time  
[77:37] she um she mentioned that quote and when people 
heard the podcast they loved it so he made me a  
[77:43] a hoodie that's great I love that a lot really 
cool um perfect we have entertain in the podcast  
[77:50] as you might know uh that previous guest is asking 
a question for the next guest without knowing who  
[77:54] the next actually is uh and the previous guest 
asked you a very hard question if Bitcoin didn't  
[78:01] exist but you could only buy one asset for the 
next 20 years what would it be geez if Bitcoin  
[78:08] didn't exist I guess it would be I don't know 
I think it would have to be I I don't want to  
[78:14] say any of these things because all I think is 
Bitcoin but I would say um gold or real estate  
[78:18] yeah it seems to be the safest bat for 20 years 
I go I probably probably go because it's more  
[78:25] uh salable and divisible and stuff like that and 
real estate and and transferable but yeah like  
[78:30] I I I would probably also go with with gold it 
seems to be even though I wasn't a gold guy before  
[78:38] Bitcoin yeah even though it's uh it's definitely 
um dwarfed by Bitcoin but I just think even real  
[78:45] estate it's a hard one because you know you pay 
property taxes every year and then you have to  
[78:49] pay for maintenance on this place so how much you 
know is it really worth it over the years but I  
[78:53] think based on the amount of um you know dollars 
that are created into the world uh over the years  
[79:00] I think 20 years time would give you a decent 
um you know for a property to to have gone up  
[79:07] in value not in value I always tell when people 
talk about houses too I tell them it doesn't go  
[79:11] up in value it's just you need more dollars to buy 
a house because dollars are worthless so worthless  
[79:17] worthless yeah absolutely it's it's like people 
buy houses and stocks and think the the value  
[79:24] go goes up and then you they don't realize they 
actually uh falling down a cliff and they see the  
[79:30] houses uh just go up because the price is is going 
up yeah that's a great Point um yeah really cool  
[79:36] I enjoyed it a lot having you on Stacy um before
